[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:04.612]  You want answers?
[00:00:04.612 --> 00:00:06.514]  Well so does he.
[00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:10.357]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:10.357 --> 00:00:14.420]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.662]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:34.662 --> 00:00:35.102]  Welcome.
[00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:36.604]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:38.526]  It is the 21st day of May, 2008.
[00:00:38.526 --> 00:00:49.779]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours, then over the web at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, as well as InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com and TruthNews.us.
[00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:53.924]  We will restream the show back-to-back until the next live transmission.
[00:00:55.416 --> 00:01:00.260]  Government may have a massive surveillance program for use in national emergency.
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.025]  Eight million potential suspects to be rounded up and taken to FEMA camps, and this has come out in government documents.
[00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.147]  We already knew this, but here it is back in the news.
[00:01:09.147 --> 00:01:10.768]  We'll go over it.
[00:01:10.768 --> 00:01:14.411]  Also, supply concerns puts oil above $130 for the first time.
[00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:28.037]  And, uh, Goldman Sachs again is coming out, as well as JPMorgan Chase, and saying they see $200 a barrel of oil, as we told you they would do two years ago.
[00:01:28.037 --> 00:01:29.138]  You like the New World Order?
[00:01:29.138 --> 00:01:31.079]  Well, get ready to really like them.
[00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.781]  And all those police that are militarized, dressed like ringwraiths?
[00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:40.143]  That's if you get out of line on your journey to slavery.
[00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:45.346]  House passes bill to sue OPEC over oil prices, as if OPEC has anything real to do with it.
[00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:50.036]  OPEC, of course, has nothing to do with the dollar being devalued.
[00:01:51.863 --> 00:01:55.324]  But, again, the slave population can't even figure that out.
[00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:58.166]  Uh, Ventura attacks media for criticizing his free speech.
[00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:06.149]  Another big story, uh, going out in the next hour or so at PrisonPlanet.com by Paul Watson, detailing some other, uh, facets.
[00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.969]  But this story by Curt Nemo up on InfoWars.
[00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.950]  You can get it out to everybody right now.
[00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.612]  Make sure the mainstream media bites on this again so we can have even more people looking to 9-11 truth.
[00:02:14.612 --> 00:02:19.194]  And so other celebrities and government officials, public servants, have the courage to go public.
[00:02:19.714 --> 00:02:26.520]  Ventura attacks media for criticizing free speech, attacked for simply asking questions, and I'm told he was on Stern's show today and they attacked him.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.143]  He just said, look, I'm a demolition expert, so they blew it up.
[00:02:29.143 --> 00:02:33.407]  The one question I meant to ask him, I dropped the ball, was, okay, who do you think blew it up?
[00:02:33.407 --> 00:02:34.848]  And obviously, he's implying the government.
[00:02:34.848 --> 00:02:38.751]  He said, oh, they staged Gulf of Tonkin and other events, but why did they blow it up?
[00:02:38.751 --> 00:02:41.374]  Because it'd be good to have him say that.
[00:02:41.374 --> 00:02:42.715]  But you can't be perfect, can you?
[00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:46.597]  Kennedy being released from hospital, returning to Cape Cod.
[00:02:46.597 --> 00:02:59.388]  Senator Edward Kennedy, they say, has a brain tumor which is almost 100% terminal, and it's the common brain tumor, once very rare, associated with 10 years or more of cell phone use.
[00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:03.791]  It's on the side of the lobe where he used his cell phone.
[00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:06.553]  And, hey, didn't care about letting those go on the market, did you?
[00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:07.554]  Went ahead and went along with it.
[00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:09.876]  Well, it's alright, we all die, don't we?
[00:03:09.876 --> 00:03:13.299]  All part of drinking from the same black cup of death.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.262]  Again, Goldman Sachs Oracle of Oils is $200 a barrel of oil.
[00:03:18.262 --> 00:03:20.963]  Attack on Iran, trashed the Constitution, Ray McGovern.
[00:03:20.963 --> 00:03:23.865]  I want to get him on soon again.
[00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:26.546]  General Dynamics or Bilderberg Group.
[00:03:26.546 --> 00:03:33.850]  It is the Bilderberg Group that is reportedly going to be in Chantilly, Virginia, right outside D.C.
[00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.531]  That is confirmed by Jim Tucker now.
[00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:37.092]  It was a ruse that they were in Greece.
[00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.132]  I thought that was the case.
[00:03:38.132 --> 00:03:41.234]  Didn't want to be mean to our guest who was saying that.
[00:03:41.234 --> 00:03:42.575]  June 6th through 8th.
[00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:55.990]  And a caller, they made a call to General Dynamics and confirmed that they've rented it out, so I guess they're the front company to do that.
[00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:05.474]  And Jim Tucker, we have a detailed report up on PrisonPlanet.com, broke here yesterday, that Jim Tucker has triple confirmed through his source in Bilderberg, through the Dutch Embassy
[00:04:06.598 --> 00:04:14.220]  And through other sources, well really four sources, three individual sources and separately calling the hotel, they are booked out for that space.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.661]  So he says he is 100% confirmed on that.
[00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:24.403]  Bilderberg confirmed, Westfields, Marriott, Chantilly, Virginia, June 5th through 8th.
[00:04:24.403 --> 00:04:28.224]  And I'm tentatively saying in the next two days I'm going to book passage.
[00:04:28.224 --> 00:04:30.865]  And yes, I'm going to go there.
[00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:34.206]  I will take no pleasure in being in the proximity of such evil, but it's my job.
[00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:34.766]  I've got to do it.
[00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:41.891]  It is my duty, and I'll be taking some of the boys with me.
[00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:46.753]  All right, we'll be right back after this quick break to plunge in all the vital news.
[00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:50.355]  I'll also tell you about the big guests we've got lined up for you today.
[00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:50.815]  Stay with me.
[00:04:54.824 --> 00:04:58.426]  Imagine, a firefly, simple and innocent.
[00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:01.288]  The ability to light the night sky.
[00:05:01.288 --> 00:05:04.550]  The ozone layer, unseen by the naked eye.
[00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.431]  Life-sustaining.
[00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:10.053]  Our ocean, primordial soup breathes life.
[00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:12.034]  Bring the wonders of nature home.
[00:05:12.694 --> 00:05:21.386]  Soleil Salt Lamps, handcrafted from million-year-old crystal salt, will gently ionize and purify your indoor air, helping you breathe easier.
[00:05:21.386 --> 00:05:29.017]  Nourish your mind and body with soothing colors for deep relaxation, and neutralize EMF radiation, protecting your family's health.
[00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:30.961]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:32.682]  A new world order.
[00:05:32.682 --> 00:05:33.882]  In the near future.
[00:06:00.296 --> 00:06:03.357]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:06:03.357 --> 00:06:06.198]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:06.198 --> 00:06:08.978]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:08.978 --> 00:06:12.159]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:19.481]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:22.512 --> 00:06:27.976]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:27.976 --> 00:06:31.838]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:31.838 --> 00:06:34.400]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.561]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:36.341]  They're not after money.
[00:06:36.341 --> 00:06:37.622]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:37.622 --> 00:06:38.623]  They're after power.
[00:06:38.623 --> 00:06:39.764]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:06:39.764 --> 00:06:44.527]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:49.250]  Endgame.
[00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.291]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:52.332]  You have been warned.
[00:06:53.273 --> 00:06:59.280]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:10.755]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[00:07:11.155 --> 00:07:12.296]  Here's the story.
[00:07:12.296 --> 00:07:20.462]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[00:07:20.462 --> 00:07:21.602]  And here's the best part.
[00:07:21.602 --> 00:07:23.304]  It's 100% legal.
[00:07:23.304 --> 00:07:29.728]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[00:07:29.728 --> 00:07:34.551]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:38.874]  Best of all, you could be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less.
[00:07:38.874 --> 00:07:39.675]  It's that simple.
[00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:43.616]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[00:07:43.616 --> 00:07:46.897]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.
[00:07:46.897 --> 00:07:53.359]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[00:07:53.359 --> 00:07:58.761]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:01.042]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:12.493]  For those that don't know, let me give you the heads up.
[00:08:12.493 --> 00:08:23.278]  The federal government is completely signed over now to private foreign corporations who have their own private intelligence agencies, their own mercenary forces.
[00:08:23.278 --> 00:08:31.542]  They have fully dismantled the Bill of Rights and Constitution, even by legislation, which is null and void and a fraud.
[00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:35.664]  They are engaging in every form of crime imaginable on its face.
[00:08:36.573 --> 00:08:45.495]  They are arrogantly carrying out eugenics programs of sterilization and murder against the entire population.
[00:08:45.495 --> 00:08:49.356]  All of us are being sprayed, poisoned, the water's being poisoned.
[00:08:49.356 --> 00:08:52.417]  The vaccines have bioweapons in them.
[00:08:52.417 --> 00:08:53.697]  This is all documented.
[00:08:53.697 --> 00:08:56.358]  We are under red-level attack at every level.
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:10.968]  There is a false reality of TV and sports and supermodels and the general public thinking everything's fine kind of running forward in this controlled paradigm of the corporate controlled media.
[00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:22.955]  The SWAT teams are putting how many people they've killed on the sides of their tanks like kills from World War II on the side of a P-38 Lightning or P-38 Mustang I guess you'd say.
[00:09:22.955 --> 00:09:25.036]  It's just all insane and
[00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:33.673]  And to really face reality and see what it is and understand that they're just building hundreds of new prisons every year.
[00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:37.035]  We have more people in prison than any other country in the world.
[00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:44.638]  I've got reports, mainstream reports, where a student falls asleep at their desk because their mother went to the hospital the night before.
[00:09:44.638 --> 00:09:51.761]  And the policeman comes in, slams them up against the wall, puts them in handcuffs, and says, it's disorderly conduct.
[00:09:51.761 --> 00:09:55.463]  And then they're put on probation as criminals for falling asleep at their desk.
[00:09:56.407 --> 00:10:07.696]  Right here in Austin for ten years, anyone with more than three late tardies is fraudulently, there's not even a law, we expose this, sent to the principal.
[00:10:07.696 --> 00:10:11.680]  Then the police handcuff them, scare them, then give them a ticket.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.964]  They then have special courts in all the elementary schools in Austin where it's all color of law.
[00:10:16.964 --> 00:10:21.507]  They threaten the parents to sign documents, signing the elementary student over to them.
[00:10:21.507 --> 00:10:23.409]  I mean, it's just hell on earth.
[00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:30.447]  Ten years in prison for speeding.
[00:10:30.447 --> 00:10:33.548]  Weeks in jail for no seatbelt.
[00:10:33.548 --> 00:10:36.789]  If you even talk back, they tase you, beat you, and then out of hand.
[00:10:36.789 --> 00:10:45.471]  It is policy to then charge you with resisting and assault with their own squad car video, where you don't even touch them, or they'll bump up against you.
[00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:49.912]  I mean, just reckless, total evil, everywhere, spreading at maximum speed.
[00:10:54.318 --> 00:10:57.300]  Every instinct I've got is to evacuate this country.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:06.484]  I have to, every day, look at my children and decide that I'm putting liberty and freedom and defense of the republic ahead of them.
[00:11:06.484 --> 00:11:07.985]  Oh yeah.
[00:11:07.985 --> 00:11:12.327]  I'd be fleeing to a third world country right now, ladies and gentlemen, even though they're bad.
[00:11:12.327 --> 00:11:15.348]  It's not scientific like it is here and it'll come there later.
[00:11:15.348 --> 00:11:16.649]  I have to, every day, put down
[00:11:17.672 --> 00:11:46.646]  uh... my paternal and maternal instincts uh... for my beautiful wonderful angelic children i have to everyday control my animal instincts but then they also just re-express themselves through abject rage and disgust god help us they're going to turn millions of iraqi vets who've tortured murdered and killed and run checkpoints and violated rights and
[00:11:47.515 --> 00:11:49.156]  Taking people to camps loose on us.
[00:11:49.156 --> 00:11:49.956]  God help us.
[00:11:49.956 --> 00:11:50.816]  I mean, I'll never forget.
[00:11:50.816 --> 00:11:51.437]  I'll never forget.
[00:11:51.437 --> 00:11:53.157]  It's in Police State 2000.
[00:11:53.157 --> 00:11:55.818]  I was watching some clips of that this morning.
[00:11:55.818 --> 00:11:58.919]  Amazed I made this film in 1998-99.
[00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:00.240]  Took me a year.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.881]  Amazed that I edited it.
[00:12:01.881 --> 00:12:02.361]  Voiced it.
[00:12:02.361 --> 00:12:05.262]  Did it all myself.
[00:12:05.262 --> 00:12:08.543]  With two other camera guys that shot video.
[00:12:08.543 --> 00:12:14.065]  And, um... I watched like 30 minutes of this morning at about 7am.
[00:12:14.065 --> 00:12:15.506]  And I was just blown away that, uh...
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.043]  The music, myself and my buddy Lance made on guitar for it.
[00:12:21.043 --> 00:12:25.247]  I'm not even a guitar player, you can hear the music I made for it.
[00:12:25.247 --> 00:12:28.270]  It's like... It sounds really evil.
[00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:37.218]  I was trying to show people how evil it was with the Marines training to put Americans in camps, take our guns, put us on our knees, blow our heads off.
[00:12:37.218 --> 00:12:38.619]  God, why did it have to happen?
[00:12:38.619 --> 00:12:40.261]  Why was the elite so evil?
[00:12:41.001 --> 00:12:44.903]  You know, the globalists with their mid-level minions think they're all a bunch of new agers.
[00:12:44.903 --> 00:12:52.106]  And it's all about the great age of Aquarius and love and light and the great work and the worshipful masters, the Masonic Order.
[00:12:52.106 --> 00:12:55.568]  And really, this morning, it really is the Masons.
[00:12:55.568 --> 00:13:00.610]  You know, people can talk about it's the Vatican, it's the Zionists, it's the this, it's the that.
[00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:05.733]  Everything, it's... You can say there's predominantly certain racial or religious groups that
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.322]  Dominate sectors of the New World Order, but at the end of it they are Masons.
[00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:12.864]  They are mystery school, mystery religion.
[00:13:12.864 --> 00:13:17.546]  That's why the all-seeing eye, the symbols, the signs.
[00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:23.970]  And then this morning I was reading over again the oath of the different degrees of Masons.
[00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.851]  The third degree of Master Mason and so on up to 33rd degree.
[00:13:26.851 --> 00:13:29.613]  Where they swear allegiance to Lucifer.
[00:13:31.334 --> 00:13:42.223]  And how they'll lie and kill and steal for other Masons, and how they'll bash each other's brains out, how they'll cut the skullcap off and bury you in the sun for the sun to roast your brain.
[00:13:42.223 --> 00:13:43.544]  Different degrees.
[00:13:43.544 --> 00:13:47.347]  How they'll slit throats, murder, kill, engage in treason.
[00:13:47.347 --> 00:13:50.189]  And you guys... I mean, that's the thing.
[00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:55.973]  Masons claim they're good, and the G's for God, and you're helping, and you're doing this great work, but look what you do!
[00:13:55.973 --> 00:13:57.715]  Most of your commanding cops are Masons.
[00:13:59.648 --> 00:14:02.530]  The top Catholics are all Masons.
[00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.092]  The top B'nai B'rith groups are all Masons.
[00:14:06.092 --> 00:14:06.892]  It's all Masonic.
[00:14:06.892 --> 00:14:12.155]  I mean, that's what the religion is.
[00:14:12.155 --> 00:14:13.936]  That's what they're into at Bohemian Grove.
[00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.537]  That's what Skull and Bones is.
[00:14:15.537 --> 00:14:17.738]  It's really disgusting.
[00:14:17.738 --> 00:14:20.920]  Really disgusting.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.482]  And then I hear, well, the Founding Fathers were Masons.
[00:14:23.482 --> 00:14:25.503]  And I hear, well, Sam Houston was a Mason.
[00:14:27.074 --> 00:14:28.015]  And it's all true.
[00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:29.096]  They were porch masons.
[00:14:29.096 --> 00:14:30.138]  They were mid-level masons.
[00:14:30.138 --> 00:14:33.461]  When they were old men, they usually became higher level and freaked out and spoke out against it.
[00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:36.585]  That's how the globalists always get control.
[00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:46.536]  They let well-meaning people charge in and take over areas and take over land and take over empire, and then their people are in control.
[00:14:46.536 --> 00:14:47.698]  It's so sophisticated.
[00:14:49.082 --> 00:15:10.396]  But I look at the New World Order and all the evil things it does, how it scientifically admits that it is dumbing everybody down, how it scientifically admits that it is trying to make us all unhealthy and poisonous so they can control us, how it scientifically admits that it's starting all these wars and funding all sides and order out of chaos.
[00:15:10.396 --> 00:15:11.977]  I mean, that is really bad.
[00:15:16.246 --> 00:15:27.289]  That is so corrupt and evil and so ruthless and so manifestly wicked.
[00:15:27.289 --> 00:15:31.950]  Manifestly evil.
[00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.051]  To do that to people.
[00:15:35.051 --> 00:15:40.733]  I don't care what excuses you make or what bizarre mental alchemy and psychological gymnastics you engage in.
[00:15:44.156 --> 00:15:55.205]  It really just comes down to a bunch of people that like power, like control, like to dominate, like to hurt people, and malfunctioning, whatever you want to call it.
[00:15:55.205 --> 00:16:03.331]  And it goes back to good people, don't want power and control, they just want to live and be comfortable and happy and want to create.
[00:16:03.331 --> 00:16:10.997]  But the parasites, they want to dominate and control the creators, and they feed off of us and use us and manipulate us and misdirect us and control us.
[00:16:12.581 --> 00:16:24.192]  And they're turning us all into a bunch of wicked animals, and I see the public just evil, just spreading evil ideas, evil systems of thought are just running rampant.
[00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:29.777]  And I see my beloved humanity has cancer all over our body.
[00:16:29.777 --> 00:16:35.843]  If humanity's six and a half billion, or six billion, three hundred and eighty million, whatever our true number is, if we
[00:16:41.613 --> 00:17:05.531]  If we are a body, the body of humanity, we've got brain cancer, we've got lung cancer, we've got skin cancer, we've got pancreatic cancer, we've got liver cancer, bone cancer, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, cancer of the optical nerve, the olfactory nerve.
[00:17:05.531 --> 00:17:07.833]  God, it's so painful for me to see this.
[00:17:09.472 --> 00:17:12.694]  I feel people's pain because I know I'm connected to all of this.
[00:17:12.694 --> 00:17:16.796]  I know the great evil growing is going to hurt me and my family.
[00:17:16.796 --> 00:17:33.625]  And so I am programmed by my humanity to understand that when wickedness happens, that when the White House writes memos saying they can sexually torture two-year-olds with pliers, that that is the pit of hell opened and hell released.
[00:17:34.731 --> 00:17:43.273]  And that if they are openly speaking, and they understand the power of those acts that they carry out, they talk about the power of stating their evil.
[00:17:43.273 --> 00:17:49.655]  I mean, that they are stating the ultimate evil, the sexual, brutal torture of children.
[00:17:49.655 --> 00:17:53.256]  And that then the public accepts it and defends it.
[00:17:53.256 --> 00:18:00.898]  And says, yes, torture is good, we're in a fight against radical Islam, when the globalists have fostered and pushed and protected radical Islam.
[00:18:00.898 --> 00:18:02.659]  And tried to make it the dominant force in Islam.
[00:18:06.337 --> 00:18:16.799]  And that they fund Al-Qaeda, admittedly, to attack Serbia and Iran right now, and Western Europe, and it's just to then scare the dumb population into submission.
[00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:20.740]  Your ignorance is going to destroy you.
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.760]  I want that to be clear to everybody listening.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.301]  We are in grave danger.
[00:18:26.301 --> 00:18:33.762]  We have very aggressive, scientifically directed, scientifically developed, military, psychological, chemical, biological,
[00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:41.393]  Uh, operations being conducted against all of us right now.
[00:18:41.393 --> 00:19:01.822]  And I'm just an average guy from Texas who reads globalist documents where they talk about how they're going to take over our religion, how they talk about how they're poisoning us, how they talk about how they're sterilizing us, how they talk about how they're dumbing us down, how they laugh at us and say, well, is it not evidence that the public deserves to be poisoned and dumbed down and killed in an orderly fashion?
[00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.609]  Because they don't know our propaganda works on them.
[00:19:05.609 --> 00:19:07.169]  Isn't that evidence they deserve it?
[00:19:07.169 --> 00:19:09.650]  No, that's not evidence they deserve it.
[00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:20.493]  Just because you can trick a child with candy, or a puppy, or another child into your van, doesn't give you a right to sit there and torture the hell out of them.
[00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:21.774]  It makes you evil.
[00:19:21.774 --> 00:19:29.976]  You know, the bizarre thrill of power you get by some begging two-year-old, three-year-old, you sons of bitches.
[00:19:33.226 --> 00:19:37.927]  You are cancer, and I just want you to know that you're gonna be defeated.
[00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:38.868]  You're gonna be brought low.
[00:19:38.868 --> 00:19:40.508]  You're gonna be crushed.
[00:19:40.508 --> 00:19:50.931]  I want you to know that, and that's why anytime I waver in my heart and soul, I want you to know that I understand you must be defeated because you are pure darkness.
[00:19:55.322 --> 00:19:58.004]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:58.004 --> 00:20:07.471]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:14.576]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:21.259]  But now it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:32.045]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:32.845 --> 00:20:33.165]  I think so.
[00:20:54.301 --> 00:20:57.163]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:20:57.163 --> 00:20:58.724]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:00.865]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:21:00.865 --> 00:21:02.766]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:02.766 --> 00:21:04.267]  The Late Great USA.
[00:21:04.267 --> 00:21:06.028]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:21:06.028 --> 00:21:13.052]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.851]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:56.851 --> 00:22:02.916]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:02.916 --> 00:22:03.717]  That's right.
[00:22:03.717 --> 00:22:06.579]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:06.579 --> 00:22:13.505]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:14.045 --> 00:22:22.191]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:22.191 --> 00:22:27.676]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:27.676 --> 00:22:33.480]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:38.004]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:22:38.004 --> 00:22:38.264]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:38.264 --> 00:22:40.106]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:22:43.328 --> 00:22:43.629]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:43.629 --> 00:22:43.829]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.985 --> 00:22:57.246]  This is David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:57.246 --> 00:23:02.909]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:04.449]  Supreme Court.
[00:23:04.449 --> 00:23:08.771]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[00:23:08.771 --> 00:23:13.373]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[00:23:13.373 --> 00:23:18.595]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[00:23:19.415 --> 00:23:27.683]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:23:29.284 --> 00:23:31.065]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:31.065 --> 00:23:31.445]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:31.445 --> 00:23:31.665]  Call now.
[00:23:31.665 --> 00:23:37.668]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:16.562]  We got Jake McGuigan, Director of the Government Relations for the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
[00:24:25.043 --> 00:24:32.269]  About a key court case against the Second Amendment, where the government's saying the Second Amendment is not admissible in a Second Amendment case.
[00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:39.095]  I've seen hundreds where the FBI goes to judges and says, don't allow the Bill of Rights into a court proceeding, and they say, yeah, it's not allowed, it's banned.
[00:24:39.095 --> 00:24:47.342]  Then Randy Kelton, who's been fighting and suing and getting police arrested and in trouble, and he'll be joining us in the studio, coming up in about an hour and a half.
[00:24:47.822 --> 00:24:48.423]  Two hours.
[00:24:48.423 --> 00:24:52.446]  And then Karen Johnson, the state senator who's been saying 9-11's an inside job.
[00:24:52.446 --> 00:24:55.448]  She'll join us for an hour, take your phone calls.
[00:24:55.448 --> 00:25:00.852]  Coming up today, I had her on for about 30 minutes a few weeks ago, and it was really interesting, so I want to have her back.
[00:25:00.852 --> 00:25:07.817]  Let me cover this first story up on PrisonPlanet.com right now from Drink Progress.
[00:25:09.446 --> 00:25:26.301]  It says, last year, former Deputy Attorney General James Comey revealed that in 2004 he refused to certify the legality, I'm gonna get him on, of certain aspects of the National Security Agency.
[00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:29.503]  And it goes on, a spy program.
[00:25:29.503 --> 00:25:35.809]  And it says, Comey witnessed Alberto Gonzalez and Andrew Card try to force a bedridden John Ashcroft to approve the program,
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:41.983]  Comey, however, did not publicly give specifics as to what the program he opposed.
[00:25:41.983 --> 00:25:51.327]  CAP's Peter Swern wrote to ThinkProgress at the time that Comey's testimony implied that other programs exist for domestic spying outside the NSA program.
[00:25:51.327 --> 00:25:57.130]  Radar's Christopher Ketchum suggests that another spy program does exist called Maine Corps.
[00:25:57.768 --> 00:25:58.529]  Doesn't suggest.
[00:25:58.529 --> 00:25:59.531]  We found it.
[00:25:59.531 --> 00:26:04.337]  A program that authorizes computer searches through massive, unspecified electronic databases.
[00:26:04.337 --> 00:26:06.180]  Those are all the major internet providers.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.421]  Scan, record, everything.
[00:26:07.421 --> 00:26:08.964]  It doesn't go to the government.
[00:26:08.964 --> 00:26:09.705]  It is the government.
[00:26:09.705 --> 00:26:14.251]  They have echelons of equipment by law and everyone, fraudulently by regulatory systems.
[00:26:14.958 --> 00:26:18.959]  In order to discover potential threats in the event of a national emergency.
[00:26:18.959 --> 00:26:25.340]  But see, they claim AI systems listen to your phone calls, read your emails, so it's not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:30.441]  Of course, just listening to any American on a phone was a felony each time they did it.
[00:26:30.441 --> 00:26:34.002]  So now they've retroactively tried to legalize it.
[00:26:34.002 --> 00:26:38.443]  But notice that Congress didn't reauthorize that, so they just still keep committing crimes.
[00:26:38.443 --> 00:26:40.283]  The government is a pack of murdering crooks.
[00:26:41.994 --> 00:26:50.220]  Maine Corps, a program that authorizes computer searches through massive, unspecified electronic databases in order to discover potential threats in the event of a national emergency.
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:27:01.569]  According to a senior governmental official, there exists a database of Americans who often, for the slightest or most trivial of reasons, are considered unfriendly and who, in a time of panic, might be incarcerated.
[00:27:02.379 --> 00:27:06.441]  Yeah, exactly what we want in a real panic is to have the cops trying to arrest 8 million people.
[00:27:06.441 --> 00:27:07.821]  That'll work real well.
[00:27:07.821 --> 00:27:09.242]  They can't do it, folks.
[00:27:09.242 --> 00:27:13.003]  Not even with the doubling, tripling, quadrupling of their terror forces.
[00:27:13.003 --> 00:27:17.565]  The database can identify and locate perceived enemies of the state almost instantaneously.
[00:27:18.445 --> 00:27:26.106]  One acknowledged source claims that 8 million Americans are listed in the main core as potential suspects in the event of a national emergency.
[00:27:26.106 --> 00:27:32.548]  These people could be subject to everything from heightened surveillance and tracking to direct questioning and possibly even detention.
[00:27:32.548 --> 00:27:36.488]  Okay, from other programs integrated, let me tell you what this is.
[00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:43.009]  The globalists set off a nuke or fund some group of Jolly Rogers to do it.
[00:27:43.009 --> 00:27:46.330]  Or they release the Black Death or whatever they've got cooked up.
[00:27:48.146 --> 00:27:51.949]  We know they've weaponized everything.
[00:27:51.949 --> 00:27:55.332]  And then they'll instantaneously have their talking points unified within minutes on the news.
[00:27:55.332 --> 00:27:58.135]  Of course, any idiot would know that means they're behind it, but so what?
[00:27:58.135 --> 00:27:58.875]  And they stand again.
[00:27:58.875 --> 00:28:01.257]  All their memos say they're gonna do it.
[00:28:01.257 --> 00:28:03.579]  And of course, it'll all come out in the mix that they designed, whatever.
[00:28:03.579 --> 00:28:07.242]  But they've killed most of the microbiologists that could identify it or worked on their programs.
[00:28:07.242 --> 00:28:07.783]  Oh, hundreds.
[00:28:07.783 --> 00:28:08.483]  Hundreds in the U.S.
[00:28:08.483 --> 00:28:09.424]  alone.
[00:28:09.424 --> 00:28:10.165]  Kill them all the time.
[00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:18.192]  Neighbors will see you guys in black uniforms, drag them off to a van, and they're found drowned in a river.
[00:28:18.192 --> 00:28:23.574]  It's total death forces getting ready to kill you and your family, if they feel like it.
[00:28:23.574 --> 00:28:28.176]  It's all part of the power trip for the New World Order, but they just turn... everything will be turned off.
[00:28:28.176 --> 00:28:33.298]  Your credit cards, bank accounts, the minute you drive out, everything is scanned.
[00:28:33.298 --> 00:28:37.980]  Your license plates are scanned nationwide, everywhere you go, at every major junction.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:43.122]  Middle of nowhere, Montana, Wyoming, West Texas, everything's scanned.
[00:28:43.122 --> 00:28:43.262]  And
[00:28:45.328 --> 00:28:58.975]  They'll just have shoot-to-kill orders, and the local cops will wait down the road for you, and when you drive by, they'll have tire spikes out on the road, and then they're just gonna, with an armored vehicle, open fire with a .50 cal on your vehicle and kill you and your whole family.
[00:28:58.975 --> 00:29:07.940]  Or, when you try to go in and buy something, the face-scanning camera behind the counter, and by the law in Chicago, New York, they're making them wire all their cameras into it right now, it'll scan you.
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:14.524]  They'll go ahead and show you the product, and then they will respond, and they'll just gun you down.
[00:29:16.187 --> 00:29:22.611]  So just be advised, once all this unfolds, realize you don't have a choice but to fight back.
[00:29:22.611 --> 00:29:28.414]  You know, we've always been peaceful here, but at the point of, just know when you're coming up on them, they're going to be trying to kill you.
[00:29:28.414 --> 00:29:30.796]  That's 8 million of you.
[00:29:30.796 --> 00:29:34.118]  And, uh, they're going to be using foreign troops for most of it.
[00:29:34.118 --> 00:29:34.638]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:44.093 --> 00:29:48.019]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:54.347]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:54.347 --> 00:29:55.769]  It is a big idea.
[00:29:55.769 --> 00:29:59.495]  A new world order in the near future.
[00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:03.460]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.301]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:30:06.301 --> 00:30:09.082]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:30:09.082 --> 00:30:12.263]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:30:12.263 --> 00:30:19.586]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:30:22.625 --> 00:30:28.049]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:30:28.049 --> 00:30:31.451]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:30:53.186 --> 00:30:58.532]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[00:30:58.532 --> 00:31:03.418]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[00:31:03.418 --> 00:31:11.407]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[00:31:11.727 --> 00:31:20.713]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:57.589]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[00:31:57.589 --> 00:31:59.249]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[00:32:03.339 --> 00:32:07.800]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.581]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[00:32:10.581 --> 00:32:13.001]  They keep you down, they keep you blue.
[00:32:13.001 --> 00:32:17.942]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[00:32:17.942 --> 00:32:20.403]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[00:32:20.403 --> 00:32:25.744]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[00:32:27.682 --> 00:32:32.264]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[00:32:32.264 --> 00:32:37.085]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:32:37.085 --> 00:32:42.047]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[00:32:42.047 --> 00:32:46.528]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:32:46.528 --> 00:32:48.769]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:50.950]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:33:09.875 --> 00:33:14.738]  I'm looking at the New York Sun headline a week and a half ago.
[00:33:14.738 --> 00:33:21.162]  Gag on Second Amendment in trial.
[00:33:21.162 --> 00:33:33.150]  And we have Jake McGuigan, I hope I'm pronouncing that right, Director of the Government Relations for the National Shooting Sports Foundation on with us.
[00:33:34.267 --> 00:33:49.356]  And, sir, first tell us a little bit about the organization and then let's get into some of the quotes that you and others had here in the article about how, you know, I mean, saying you have a Second Amendment in a trial about the Second Amendment is pretty amazing.
[00:33:49.356 --> 00:33:52.238]  It is pretty amazing, Alex.
[00:33:52.238 --> 00:33:53.659]  My name is Jake McGuigan.
[00:33:53.659 --> 00:33:57.941]  I'm the Director of Government Relations for the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
[00:33:57.941 --> 00:34:00.343]  We are the trade association for the firearms industry.
[00:34:01.185 --> 00:34:05.069]  So, you know, people usually ask, well, how are you any different from the NRA?
[00:34:05.069 --> 00:34:08.371]  And the NRA represents an individual's rights.
[00:34:08.371 --> 00:34:11.174]  You know, your Second Amendment rights as an individual.
[00:34:11.174 --> 00:34:14.977]  And we are representing the business side of things, the trade association.
[00:34:14.977 --> 00:34:18.620]  So we work very closely and work hand in hand on a lot of issues.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:23.304]  If it's going to affect the individual, it will affect the business and vice versa.
[00:34:23.304 --> 00:34:27.107]  So a lot of our members are the manufacturers like Smith & Wesson, Beretta.
[00:34:27.928 --> 00:34:44.933]  uh... winchester and and and the like that's where we're coming from and pretty closely involved in a lot of these uh... you know lawsuits where they're suing uh... whether it's the retailers which we also represent uh... or manufacturers as we know in the past you know the
[00:34:45.686 --> 00:34:52.848]  And there are still some lawsuits pending out there where people are trying to sue the gun manufacturers for liability.
[00:34:52.848 --> 00:35:04.211]  Well, the General Counsel of your organization, which is one of the largest in the country, by the way, folks, for gun owners' rights, says apparently Mayor Bloomberg has a problem with both the First and Second Amendment.
[00:35:04.211 --> 00:35:12.874]  Lawrence Kean, the General Counsel of the Firearms Industry Association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said, and there's more quotes in here,
[00:35:13.862 --> 00:35:16.205]  That's a great quote.
[00:35:16.205 --> 00:35:19.809]  I told him that was a very telling quote.
[00:35:19.809 --> 00:35:26.637]  Mayor Bloomberg, as many gun owners probably know, has a personal agenda.
[00:35:27.416 --> 00:35:44.166]  Uh, to go after whether it's the retailers, whether he is going after retailers, um, blaming them for illegal, uh, sales, store purchases, um, you know, as well as the industry itself with various other pieces of regulations in place.
[00:35:44.713 --> 00:35:49.197]  So, you know, this is just another step forward for Mayor Bloomberg.
[00:35:49.197 --> 00:35:59.725]  He, you know, now, like Larry Keene said, what he wants to do is neuter or remove the Second Amendment from this trial.
[00:35:59.725 --> 00:36:09.633]  This is a, you know, shop in Georgia who is getting sued by Mayor Bloomberg, you know, saying that he is, you know, taking part in illegal gun sales.
[00:36:10.442 --> 00:36:18.966]  Um, and Mayor Bloomberg has sued 27 out-of-state gun shops, uh, in his little sting that he has been doing on his own.
[00:36:18.966 --> 00:36:24.849]  And this is just another attempt to, uh, to try to close down small retailers or to get them settled.
[00:36:25.801 --> 00:36:42.513]  Uh, you know, and Mr. Wallace, who owns Adventure Outdoors in Georgia, also has a countersuit against Mayor Bloomberg for defamation in this as well, and he is going forward with this lawsuit where they're trying to take the Second Amendment out, as well as his countersuit against Mayor Bloomberg.
[00:36:42.513 --> 00:36:48.738]  So, it's a lot of fun down there on this, and you know, to be perfectly honest with
[00:36:49.990 --> 00:37:04.527]  You got Mayor Bloomberg going after these states saying that they're sore states and that's where all the illegal guns are coming from, yet you look at ATF statistics and all the guns used in crimes, the number one state, sore state, is New York State.
[00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:21.091]  Well, this is an insane new precedent they're trying to set that mayors and governors are like mini-federal kings who can rule surrounding states or states that are 800 miles away, like Georgia.
[00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:23.412]  So this is absolutely out of control.
[00:37:23.412 --> 00:37:29.635]  I mean, it's like claiming New York is a federal government and has this interstate commerce clause, which is even fraudulent when the feds claim it.
[00:37:30.015 --> 00:37:34.356]  Here's some quotes from the arguments concerning the gang order.
[00:37:34.356 --> 00:37:41.738]  Any references by counsel to the Second Amendment or analogous state constitutional provisions are likewise irrelevant.
[00:37:41.738 --> 00:37:47.679]  So they're saying even our state rights are irrelevant in our state courts because government's lawless.
[00:37:47.679 --> 00:37:48.779]  That's what their attorney said.
[00:37:48.779 --> 00:37:54.420]  And it goes on, if you can't discuss the Bill of Rights in the Court of Law, where should we discuss these issues?
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.501]  Should we reserve it for the tavern?
[00:37:57.339 --> 00:38:03.023]  Uh, said, uh, Mr., uh, Mr. Runazelli, said the city's lawsuit did implicate the Second Amendment.
[00:38:03.023 --> 00:38:09.528]  The politics involved here is whether the city has the power to go to another state and control the lawful sale of firearms.
[00:38:09.528 --> 00:38:17.133]  And we know that, uh, the, uh, my boss' son, uh, Mayor Daley, is also trying to go after guns all over the country, right here in Texas.
[00:38:17.133 --> 00:38:18.514]  I mean, these, these, these guys,
[00:38:19.374 --> 00:38:26.416]  I want the monopoly of force of government to basically be our gods, and I for one, sir, am tired of it.
[00:38:26.416 --> 00:38:38.379]  As the Director of Government Relations, when you're dealing with government, we know the UN said at the UNIDIR Summit in New York on July 7, 2000, that they are for banning ownership of all guns in the US.
[00:38:38.379 --> 00:38:43.360]  We know this is also a global agenda, and I see the Second Amendment under greater attack now than ever.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:52.782]  But frankly, I don't hear the NRA and others ringing the alarm bells that they've tripled the size of the BATF and the Second Amendment is going under like the Titanic.
[00:38:52.782 --> 00:38:53.922]  You know what?
[00:38:53.922 --> 00:38:54.962]  I would agree with you 100%.
[00:38:54.962 --> 00:39:07.105]  This is a battle that, you know, needs to go all the way down to the grassroots level and, you know, to us representing the manufacturers and, you know, the gun deal is throughout the U.S.
[00:39:07.105 --> 00:39:08.445]  because what you said is
[00:39:09.451 --> 00:39:10.812]  You know, it's something we are facing.
[00:39:10.812 --> 00:39:13.172]  We are facing on the international level with the UN.
[00:39:13.172 --> 00:39:22.536]  We are facing it on the local level, whether it's with the Brady Campaign or the Educational Fund to Stop Handgun Violence, whatever their name is.
[00:39:22.536 --> 00:39:24.537]  And, you know, they
[00:39:26.038 --> 00:39:31.240]  You know, are working together and unifying because they think, you know, that they're gaining power in this.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:51.990]  And like you said, whether it's the UN, whether it's the Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which is Bloomberg's little coalition where he thinks he can go after states where he feels that guns are coming from, you know, and not even that, overstepping the bounds of the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[00:39:52.549 --> 00:39:58.934]  He is overstepping those bounds, and he's been told by both of those agencies, hey, this is our area to investigate.
[00:39:58.934 --> 00:40:06.920]  You are involving yourselves in investigations, and you're compromising the safety of law enforcement officials.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:19.670]  So, you know, it's a difficult battle, you know, and hopefully the Supreme Court comes out with a strong case, but I wouldn't be holding my breath on that decision either, you know, in June.
[00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:21.151]  You never know what's going to happen with that.
[00:40:21.693 --> 00:40:37.199]  So, you know, like you said, I tell people all the time that depending on how you feel about the political arena or the President right now, putting John Bolton into the U.N.
[00:40:37.199 --> 00:40:43.721]  was one of the greatest moves just because of his stance that he did for us and for gun owners and for the industry.
[00:40:43.721 --> 00:40:45.762]  In that vote that you said back in 2000 where the
[00:40:51.678 --> 00:41:17.954]  No, I understand that, but it's like Bush saying in speeches, we have an individual right to own guns unless prescribed by law, and that's what I'm seeing happen with the Supreme Court ruling from reading the oral arguments and then the different briefs made by the NRA, the anti-gun folks, and then the people that were suing for their rights.
[00:41:18.634 --> 00:41:47.530]  Uh, the disarmed security guard who was attacked, and you're sitting there looking at it, and, uh, they're going to come out in the next month or two, I guarantee it, and rule, and it's going to be hailed as a pro-Second Amendment rule, and they're going to say, oh, you got an individual right, unless prescribed by law, and then they're going to say, okay, now we can ban your guns, or kind of be like New York City, where if you jump through 45 flaming hoops, on, you know, standing on your head with your arms tied behind your back, uh, that maybe you might be able to own a gun.
[00:41:48.090 --> 00:42:09.798]  And that's my biggest fear, even personally, that it's going to be this, whatever they constitute a reasonable restriction on a state level, on a city level, I mean, what this will do is most likely open up the door for lawsuits, whether we're dealing with Cook County in Chicago, or like you said, New York City, where they're going to challenge what is a reasonable restriction.
[00:42:11.759 --> 00:42:23.225]  There is no reasonable restriction, and then once you, we need Vermont, look, the places with the lowest crime, Vermont, places like Arizona, as you know, but for listeners, they have the lowest crime rate, even in big urban areas.
[00:42:23.225 --> 00:42:30.749]  It's areas like New York City, like Chicago, that have these corrupt big city mayors that rule over their slaves, that's what they are, disarmed persons of slave.
[00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:38.781]  I mean, it's just amazing that they disarm us when the average 9-11 call takes 11 minutes to respond to.
[00:42:38.781 --> 00:42:42.067]  They have no right to disarm me so the criminals can have their way with me.
[00:42:43.689 --> 00:42:57.220]  I agree with you 100%, and it's not even that, the disarming, it's even the further steps that they're taking, whether it's legislation like bullet serialization or micro-stamping of firearms.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:04.666]  I mean, micro-stamping right now is a major threat, because that is going to force the industry,
[00:43:05.453 --> 00:43:08.274]  Passed on to, you know, California, who already passed the legislation.
[00:43:08.274 --> 00:43:12.616]  And then that standardizes cars, air conditioning, it's all on California standards, the most popular.
[00:43:12.616 --> 00:43:15.358]  Explain what Schwarzenegger's done, the so-called Republican.
[00:43:15.358 --> 00:43:19.459]  Sure, I'll just give you a quick rundown for a lot of you listeners who may not know.
[00:43:19.459 --> 00:43:30.564]  What Ronald Schwarzenegger has done, he signed a law, what's going to mandate, micro-stamping of handguns, of firearms, in California as of July, uh, January 1, 2010.
[00:43:32.501 --> 00:43:38.649]  What that means is that the firing pin of a handgun needs to be micro-stamped with, um,
[00:43:40.089 --> 00:43:45.294]  The serial number or identifying characters which will imprint on the cartridge casing, in theory.
[00:43:45.294 --> 00:44:03.790]  And that'll make all of the gun manufacturers adopt a certain amount of guns that have that, and then it'll be adopted all over the country, it'll bankrupt a lot of them, and then next they're talking about not letting you own a gun unless it has that, so when you get the certification that you had it added, now you've been registered, I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:06.973]  But the thing is, it doesn't work.
[00:44:07.603 --> 00:44:08.864]  It's easily defeated.
[00:44:08.864 --> 00:44:12.966]  As most of your listeners know, you can swap out a firing pin in less than a minute.
[00:44:12.966 --> 00:44:16.427]  But that's a reason to swap team your house to see if you've done that.
[00:44:16.427 --> 00:44:18.828]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:18.828 --> 00:44:26.532]  Or the criminals will move to revolvers, or they will just file down the firing pin so that that identifier is not on there.
[00:44:26.532 --> 00:44:28.112]  This is not a gun.
[00:44:28.112 --> 00:44:29.133]  It doesn't work.
[00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:30.273]  It doesn't work.
[00:44:30.273 --> 00:44:32.414]  It's a new tax, but we know what it's about.
[00:44:32.414 --> 00:44:33.415]  It's drawing the Second Amendment.
[00:44:34.175 --> 00:44:36.217]  And we don't oppose it from a gun control standpoint.
[00:44:36.217 --> 00:44:39.258]  We oppose it from the fact that it doesn't work.
[00:44:39.258 --> 00:44:46.423]  It's going to enforce the manufacturers to spend a ton of money, and then where is it going to get passed on to the end consumer, where it's going to be?
[00:44:46.423 --> 00:44:46.903]  We don't know.
[00:44:46.903 --> 00:44:53.487]  It could be as high as $200 per firearm, because there's only one inventor of the technology.
[00:44:53.487 --> 00:44:57.209]  So he can price it for whatever he wants to price it at.
[00:44:57.209 --> 00:44:57.890]  Unbelievable.
[00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.230]  This is disgusting.
[00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.291]  We've got to get this repeal.
[00:45:00.291 --> 00:45:01.652]  We've got to get Schwarzenegger out of there.
[00:45:02.835 --> 00:45:12.664]  It was a, you know, I think it was a family situation where Senator Kennedy is sponsoring the same legislation on the federal level.
[00:45:12.664 --> 00:45:20.130]  And it was, you know... I'm sad for him, but his brain tumor is going to handle that.
[00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:23.593]  I mean, this guy wants me and my family to be disarmed so we can be raped and killed.
[00:45:25.754 --> 00:45:31.457]  You know, it's just I hope when he faces his maker that he's proud of himself for all the victim disarmament he's done.
[00:45:31.457 --> 00:45:42.002]  Because the Kennedy gun control family is responsible for hundreds of thousands of people who've been victims of crime with all their gun control in Massachusetts and other places.
[00:45:42.002 --> 00:45:43.003]  It's a shameful family.
[00:45:44.242 --> 00:46:10.618]  And you know what, a lot of the stats on out there of the number of crimes that have been thwarted from just showing or brandishing a firearm, you know, that's the thing that, you know, they want to say, you know, oh, it shouldn't be in the hands of law abiding citizens, only authorities should have it, and this, that, and the other thing, but they can't quote, or they don't have the statistics to show how many crimes have been stopped from happening and how much personal protection comes from it.
[00:46:11.639 --> 00:46:15.843]  You and I are on the same page, I believe.
[00:46:15.843 --> 00:46:16.703]  Well, yes, sir.
[00:46:16.703 --> 00:46:26.111]  We're talking, of course, ladies and gentlemen, to the fellow that is the main Director of Government Relations of the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
[00:46:26.111 --> 00:46:28.133]  In closing, with the two or three minutes we've got left,
[00:46:28.934 --> 00:46:38.822]  Give us the website, how folks get involved, how they support the Second Amendment, and then anything else that's happening that's important news we should know about.
[00:46:38.822 --> 00:46:43.526]  Right off the bat, our website is nssf.org.
[00:46:43.526 --> 00:46:48.150]  That's nssf.org.
[00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:50.532]  You'll see a lot of our programs we offer.
[00:46:50.532 --> 00:46:53.095]  We have the Scholastic Clay Target Program, and a lot of
[00:46:54.955 --> 00:47:09.020]  You know, programs to get younger generations involved in shooting sports and hunting, and at the same time we have our legislative side of things where we are lobbying for the firearms manufacturers, for advice to give to people.
[00:47:10.143 --> 00:47:11.164]  Unified.
[00:47:11.164 --> 00:47:12.105]  Being unified.
[00:47:12.105 --> 00:47:19.793]  Whether it's being a member of the NRA, whether it's being a member of your local sportsman's coalition, or your local range or gun shop.
[00:47:19.793 --> 00:47:24.518]  Just supporting these individuals and everyone that has the same view.
[00:47:24.518 --> 00:47:26.680]  Supporting the Second Amendment.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:32.926]  The other side is very well organized and they have more than enough when it comes to funding.
[00:47:33.641 --> 00:47:37.563]  We need to make sure that we do the same thing and all work together on this.
[00:47:37.563 --> 00:47:58.573]  I know there are sometimes contentious issues where, you know, some groups don't agree, but, you know, we need to make sure that coming down, whether it's this election cycle, you know, both on the local level and on the national level, it comes down to putting in the people that are going to represent you and represent your Second Amendment rights to the best of their ability.
[00:47:58.573 --> 00:48:01.795]  So, that's the best advice I can give right now.
[00:48:01.795 --> 00:48:02.175]  You know, we...
[00:48:02.947 --> 00:48:10.412]  It is a constant battle, and it keeps me gainfully employed day in and day out.
[00:48:10.412 --> 00:48:11.773]  Well, sir, thank you for joining us.
[00:48:11.773 --> 00:48:13.054]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[00:48:13.054 --> 00:48:24.042]  Where do you see this going in New York with Mayor Bloomberg saying you're not allowed to talk about the Second Amendment and putting out an imperial gag order?
[00:48:24.042 --> 00:48:24.742]  I'm not sure it'll be...
[00:48:27.068 --> 00:48:28.048]  Be used against him.
[00:48:28.048 --> 00:48:34.451]  I mean, you know, there in some cases, some people, you know, can tell what's allowed in the courtroom, what's not.
[00:48:34.451 --> 00:48:41.513]  To be honest with you, Bloomberg's reputation among us, among gun owners, among the NRA, is obviously not going to change.
[00:48:41.513 --> 00:48:52.217]  We already know what we're dealing with, and the people who support him in his home, let's say, city of New York City, you know, probably aren't going to change their opinion either.
[00:48:52.217 --> 00:48:55.978]  I just hope that, you know, Mr. Wallace from
[00:48:57.779 --> 00:49:06.063]  From Adventure Outdoors, continues to move forward with his counter suit and really, you know, defend gun owners and gun retailers.
[00:49:06.063 --> 00:49:13.186]  Because a lot of times, Bloomberg thinks with the large checkbook he has, he can bully the small retailers, get them to settle out of court.
[00:49:13.186 --> 00:49:16.068]  And this is one individual that said, you know what, I've had enough of this.
[00:49:16.068 --> 00:49:18.049]  I'm not settling and I'm going to have a counter suit.
[00:49:18.049 --> 00:49:20.030]  So, I wish all the luck.
[00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:22.691]  But he's outside his jurisdiction in purview.
[00:49:22.691 --> 00:49:24.752]  Bloomberg needs to be sued individually.
[00:49:25.955 --> 00:49:28.779]  I would support that 100%.
[00:49:28.779 --> 00:49:38.270]  Even when you have federal organizations also saying that he's outside his jurisdiction, and this is nothing where he should not be.
[00:49:39.668 --> 00:49:40.089]  Working.
[00:49:40.089 --> 00:49:51.059]  You know, the DOJ had told him to stop his, you know, little investigations and his investigators that he had down in Virginia and Georgia and all those areas.
[00:49:51.059 --> 00:49:54.823]  And the funny thing is, he points to Virginia as being a source state.
[00:49:54.823 --> 00:50:01.870]  Well, explain to me, since Virginia has one gun a month, how they're bringing all these illegal firearms from Virginia into New York City.
[00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:04.351]  Doesn't make much sense, does it?
[00:50:04.351 --> 00:50:12.275]  No, it's just a way to also create a unified database, because these mayors, as you know, have been demanding, you know, a quote, database to track all these quote, crime guns.
[00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:14.215]  Well, thank you so much for joining us, sir.
[00:50:14.215 --> 00:50:15.296]  I appreciate the time.
[00:50:15.296 --> 00:50:16.076]  I appreciate it, Alex.
[00:50:16.076 --> 00:50:16.496]  Thank you.
[00:50:16.496 --> 00:50:17.337]  Take care.
[00:50:17.337 --> 00:50:20.218]  Okay, I just wanted to give you an update on the Second Amendment there.
[00:50:20.218 --> 00:50:23.880]  We're going to come back into some of the financial news, and I'm going to cover a bunch of world news.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:29.002]  The Violent Radicalization Act, they're trying to pass it again.
[00:50:29.002 --> 00:50:32.343]  We're now learning more about these databases for mass arrests.
[00:50:32.343 --> 00:50:33.723]  Don't let that intimidate you, folks.
[00:50:33.723 --> 00:50:36.484]  You're not going to be able to get away with it.
[00:50:36.484 --> 00:50:38.145]  If we cower, they win.
[00:50:38.145 --> 00:50:40.105]  If we stand up, the globalists lose.
[00:50:40.105 --> 00:50:42.186]  Big time.
[00:50:42.186 --> 00:50:44.847]  And the article's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:44.847 --> 00:50:49.769]  We need your help getting this out to everyone and the YouTube video of my interview with Jesse Ventura.
[00:50:49.769 --> 00:50:52.410]  Ventura slams media witch hunt for questioning 9-11.
[00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:52.590]  Get it?
[00:50:54.324 --> 00:51:02.270]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:07.473]  An entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:07.473 --> 00:51:18.541]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:51:18.541 --> 00:51:20.782]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:51:21.943 --> 00:51:23.705]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:51:23.705 --> 00:51:29.831]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:51:45.467 --> 00:51:48.088]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[00:51:48.088 --> 00:51:55.850]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:51:55.850 --> 00:52:00.452]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:52:00.452 --> 00:52:04.993]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:52:04.993 --> 00:52:12.276]  Another untold story that you have not been told from AnotherUntoldStory.com
[00:52:14.585 --> 00:52:17.107]  This is the story of the honest reporter.
[00:52:17.107 --> 00:52:20.069]  Oh, but you may say, aren't all reporters honest?
[00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:26.713]  Not according to the story of the honest reporter, John Swinton, a former chief of staff of the New York Times.
[00:52:26.713 --> 00:52:31.456]  Of course, we've been programmed with story after story that reporters are honest.
[00:52:31.456 --> 00:52:44.445]  Think of how many TV programs, Hollywood movies, and the like you've seen, read, and heard of secret corruption and scandal, and finally the good guys get it to the even gooder guys and or gal reporters.
[00:52:47.526 --> 00:53:00.970]  People, what if it's all a ruse, a lie, and the so-called good guys and gal reporters are, in reality, the corrupt, scandalous, bought-off bad guys?
[00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:13.294]  In 1953, John Swinton, the former chief of staff of the New York Times, who was called by his peers the dean of his profession, was asked to give a toast before the New York Press Club.
[00:53:13.874 --> 00:53:18.035]  He was retiring and so he spoke the honest truth in that toast.
[00:53:18.035 --> 00:53:20.196]  A truth that is being kept from you.
[00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:21.376]  What did he say?
[00:53:21.376 --> 00:53:26.458]  Well, go to AnotherUntoldStory.com and find out.
[00:53:26.458 --> 00:53:31.380]  It's about time we find out what these lying scribes are all about.
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:41.303]  AnotherUntoldStory.com For another untold story go to AnotherUntoldStory.com AnotherUntoldStory.com
[00:53:43.722 --> 00:54:10.729]  There's a lot of patriot mythology out there about how to go after corrupt police, judges, other forms of demigod.
[00:54:13.598 --> 00:54:16.560]  But Randy Kelton's had some real success here in Texas.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.962]  He'll be in studio with us in about an hour.
[00:54:17.962 --> 00:54:33.895]  I'm gonna play some excerpts to analyze the propaganda and disinfo from the Howard Stern Show with Jesse Ventura this morning.
[00:54:33.895 --> 00:54:34.936]  He, of course, was on with us.
[00:54:39.881 --> 00:54:43.442]  For 50 minutes yesterday, we'll be breaking that down as well.
[00:54:43.442 --> 00:54:49.824]  Right now, supply concern puts oil above 130 for the first time.
[00:54:49.824 --> 00:54:52.125]  Another AP Disinfo headline.
[00:54:52.125 --> 00:55:01.168]  In all the foreign press that's admitted, OPEC has put out releases saying we have not increased prices, we have increased production in the last two years, which is true.
[00:55:03.064 --> 00:55:04.865]  Your dollar has been devalued.
[00:55:04.865 --> 00:55:08.746]  You make us denominate the oil in dollars, which is hurting us.
[00:55:08.746 --> 00:55:10.387]  You ask us to stay in dollars.
[00:55:10.387 --> 00:55:13.788]  The Arab nations, which are, what, 70-something percent of OPEC.
[00:55:13.788 --> 00:55:15.889]  Then Venezuela's the rest.
[00:55:15.889 --> 00:55:18.770]  They sell it to the oil companies, so they're all running scams.
[00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:20.391]  I'm not saying they're good.
[00:55:20.391 --> 00:55:23.312]  And they are gouging us a bit, but that was already going on.
[00:55:23.312 --> 00:55:28.895]  They mainly gouge us by not letting us get oil out of Alaska and other areas.
[00:55:28.895 --> 00:55:30.055]  We've got tons of it.
[00:55:30.055 --> 00:55:31.956]  They're creating artificial scarcity through a cartel.
[00:55:34.369 --> 00:55:40.075]  But the House has passed a bill to sue OPEC over oil prices, demanding they lower it.
[00:55:40.075 --> 00:55:41.877]  It's the dollar.
[00:55:41.877 --> 00:55:45.221]  90% of the increase, if you do the numbers, is dollar devaluation.
[00:55:45.221 --> 00:55:46.362]  That's why gold's gone up.
[00:55:46.362 --> 00:55:47.544]  That's why corn's gone up.
[00:55:47.544 --> 00:55:48.885]  That's one of the big reasons.
[00:55:48.885 --> 00:55:52.249]  There's a few others with the food, droughts and some problems, and speculation.
[00:55:53.748 --> 00:56:00.391]  And now we have major brokerage firms, Goldman Sachs and others, again saying $200 a barrel of oil soon.
[00:56:00.391 --> 00:56:08.374]  Look, I don't know if that's going to happen, folks, but they couldn't keep, they dumped hundreds of billions of gold onto the market in the last three months.
[00:56:08.374 --> 00:56:11.535]  They drove it down from $1,000-something to $800-something.
[00:56:11.535 --> 00:56:13.196]  It's well above $900 again.
[00:56:13.196 --> 00:56:14.956]  Silver's exploding again.
[00:56:14.956 --> 00:56:16.677]  You need to move on gold and silver now.
[00:56:16.677 --> 00:56:17.477]  I've been telling you that.
[00:56:20.439 --> 00:56:27.165]  Uh, because if they continue to devalue the dollar, and they're saying they're going to go all the way on this, I don't know if that's the case, but my goodness.
[00:56:27.165 --> 00:56:30.128]  Uh, then gold and silver is one of the few commodities you can hold.
[00:56:30.128 --> 00:56:36.293]  You're not going to be able to hold pork bellies or, uh, you know, uh, grain or, you know, that's all going to be digital.
[00:56:36.869 --> 00:56:39.230]  This is something you can hold in your hot little hand.
[00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:41.471]  Ted Anderson, tell us where gold and silver is today.
[00:56:41.471 --> 00:56:42.071]  Yeah, sure.
[00:56:42.071 --> 00:56:44.612]  Right now, silver is just touching $18 an ounce again now, $17.95.
[00:56:44.612 --> 00:56:45.792]  Gold right now is at $9.2970, so it's just
[00:56:52.458 --> 00:56:54.199]  Just short of poking into $9.30.
[00:56:54.199 --> 00:57:05.043]  It's almost like it's forgotten about all that resistance stuff that was going on, like you're talking about with the banks selling just metric tons of gold in the marketplace to keep it down.
[00:57:05.043 --> 00:57:07.564]  Right now it's just like the accelerator's back on again.
[00:57:07.564 --> 00:57:12.106]  It's just blowing through these levels faster than it did last time, which is surprising to me.
[00:57:12.106 --> 00:57:17.649]  I thought it would take a little bit more time to eat up this correction, but it's just coming back like a vengeance.
[00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:23.251]  Silver right now $17.95, gold $9.2970.
[00:57:23.251 --> 00:57:25.212]  The dollar's down today.
[00:57:25.212 --> 00:57:26.872]  Just about every other currency's up.
[00:57:26.872 --> 00:57:28.693]  The Dow Jones Industrial down.
[00:57:28.693 --> 00:57:34.235]  I mean, everything economically shows that, yeah, you're just exactly hitting the nail right on the head.
[00:57:34.235 --> 00:57:35.856]  Dollar's falling.
[00:57:35.856 --> 00:57:37.957]  Commodities are going to be going up.
[00:57:37.957 --> 00:57:43.759]  It's going to be raising havoc in the financial markets, and that's why we're seeing the Dow Jones Industrial taking a
[00:57:44.199 --> 00:57:49.741]  Take a hit on the chin, and sure enough, gold and silver up again today.
[00:57:49.741 --> 00:57:53.742]  Right now, I'm going to just continue to add to the same special we did yesterday.
[00:57:53.742 --> 00:57:56.063]  I haven't changed the prices a bit.
[00:57:56.063 --> 00:58:04.385]  Now gold almost $18 an ounce, and these Walking Liberty halves, you know, I've got them... You mean silver, $18 an ounce?
[00:58:04.385 --> 00:58:06.946]  Yeah, silver right now, $18 an ounce.
[00:58:06.946 --> 00:58:10.887]  Really good buys in the marketplace right now, holding the same prices.
[00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:11.887]  I know we're going to the break.
[00:58:11.887 --> 00:58:13.448]  You want to talk about this on the other side?
[00:58:14.088 --> 00:58:14.808]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[00:58:14.808 --> 00:58:17.509]  You got this gold and silver like a week ago when it was lower.
[00:58:17.509 --> 00:58:19.129]  It's now going up.
[00:58:19.129 --> 00:58:21.590]  You've got it locked in for a limited time.
[00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:24.451]  Again, folks, take advantage of this.
[00:58:24.451 --> 00:58:24.651]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:58:24.651 --> 00:58:31.112]  Call them right now before these prices go up.
[00:58:31.112 --> 00:58:35.493]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:35.493 --> 00:58:39.154]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:39.154 --> 00:58:40.895]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:45.961]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:45.961 --> 00:58:48.763]  A New World Order.
[00:58:48.763 --> 00:58:53.286]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:53.286 --> 00:58:56.509]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:56.509 --> 00:58:59.291]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:59.291 --> 00:59:02.473]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:02.473 --> 00:59:09.798]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:12.816 --> 00:59:18.260]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:22.142]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:22.142 --> 00:59:24.704]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:24.704 --> 00:59:25.865]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:25.865 --> 00:59:26.645]  They're not after money.
[00:59:26.645 --> 00:59:27.926]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:27.926 --> 00:59:28.907]  They're after power.
[00:59:28.907 --> 00:59:30.048]  That's what I have to do, sir.
[00:59:30.048 --> 00:59:38.773]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:38.773 --> 00:59:39.534]  Endgame.
[00:59:39.534 --> 00:59:41.595]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:59:41.595 --> 00:59:42.636]  You have been warned.
[00:59:46.738 --> 00:59:49.139]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:49.139 --> 00:59:58.605]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.605 --> 01:00:00.366]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:00.366 --> 01:00:01.926]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.926 --> 01:00:03.867]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:07.689]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.689 --> 01:00:11.752]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.897 --> 01:00:16.539]  During the breaks, I've been listening to clips.
[01:00:16.539 --> 01:00:21.722]  Burmas is out there listening to Jesse Ventura from a few hours ago on the Creighton Howard Stearns Show.
[01:00:21.722 --> 01:00:29.227]  Ventura, when attacked, really went further and said, basically, Building 7 was an insurance scam.
[01:00:29.227 --> 01:00:30.728]  This is absolutely huge.
[01:00:30.728 --> 01:00:35.011]  Paul Watson will be airing the audio in T-minus eight minutes.
[01:00:35.011 --> 01:00:41.936]  Get ready, I want a blurb article up now, and I want our listeners to jam this four-wind to every corner of the planet.
[01:00:43.112 --> 01:00:54.080]  Because the enemy will bite on this, and all the tens of millions of moron Howard Stern fans will then finally wake up because Stern is babbling and stuttering during it.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.482]  Again, I just commend Jesse Ventura's courage.
[01:00:56.482 --> 01:00:59.524]  Again, it isn't that we worship Ventura, or he's perfect.
[01:00:59.524 --> 01:01:01.405]  It's that this is a celebrity culture.
[01:01:01.405 --> 01:01:04.508]  He's a former Navy SEAL, demolition expert.
[01:01:04.508 --> 01:01:06.009]  Burmas has been listening to 20 minutes of it.
[01:01:06.009 --> 01:01:06.909]  We've got a five-minute clip.
[01:01:06.909 --> 01:01:08.891]  I'm going to have Burmas come in in a minute.
[01:01:08.891 --> 01:01:10.092]  But let's go back to Ted Anderson.
[01:01:11.983 --> 01:01:13.703]  The country's going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:16.044]  You've got great prices on gold and silver.
[01:01:16.044 --> 01:01:19.285]  You've got this price... I know you told me it's locked in.
[01:01:19.285 --> 01:01:20.765]  When is this price locked in from?
[01:01:20.765 --> 01:01:22.425]  Because I know it's gone up.
[01:01:22.425 --> 01:01:38.388]  When we were at $888 gold, and when we had silver at roughly $16.60 an ounce, I picked up the Walking Liberty halves, and I also picked up the British Sovereigns, and also the French Swiss Franks, those.
[01:01:38.388 --> 01:01:40.569]  And currently, right now, we are carrying the Franks
[01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:52.740]  At $199, I have the British Sovereigns at $250, and I have these Walking Liberties, which I couldn't even sell four weeks ago because I couldn't get them, at $182 per roll.
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:54.982]  Not kidding you, Alex.
[01:01:54.982 --> 01:01:57.104]  I mean, I just was completely sold out.
[01:01:57.104 --> 01:02:01.708]  Not only me, Kitco and all the major gold dealers and silver dealers in the United States.
[01:02:02.108 --> 01:02:07.650]  A lot of them are still sold out, and now the run on it has started again as the dollar further implodes.
[01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:18.854]  And folks, if you watch the graph, the dollar plunges by 5, and I'm just saying that as a hypothetical number, then it goes back up by 3, then it plunges by 5, back up by 2, plunges by 3, back up by 1.
[01:02:18.854 --> 01:02:22.356]  You know, it's always going down, and then you get fooled
[01:02:23.036 --> 01:02:28.617]  When gold has a minor correction, but if you look at the six-month, year, two-year, five-year graph, it's going straight up.
[01:02:28.617 --> 01:02:29.737]  It's going to.
[01:02:29.737 --> 01:02:32.338]  The dollar is going down the tubes.
[01:02:32.338 --> 01:02:33.698]  You've got to give Ted a call.
[01:02:33.698 --> 01:02:34.558]  Ted, give him the number.
[01:02:34.558 --> 01:02:35.098]  Yeah, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:02:35.098 --> 01:02:35.458]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:02:35.458 --> 01:02:42.499]  And you've got to remember, $182 is the price right now, but last time I had gold, or last time I had silver over $18, these were trading at $205 per roll.
[01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:54.743]  So this is a really good buy and I would suggest you get in them now.
[01:02:54.743 --> 01:02:59.605]  Now, again, folks, you need to get into real metals, real commodities.
[01:02:59.605 --> 01:03:06.108]  This is one of the only portable commodities that is out there other than food and that's, again, hard to carry around with you.
[01:03:06.108 --> 01:03:09.830]  Understand, precious metals, gold and silver, move into it now.
[01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:11.071]  You can't beat this deal.
[01:03:11.071 --> 01:03:11.791]  Give them the number, Ted.
[01:03:12.071 --> 01:03:17.696]  Yeah, again, 1-800-686-2237, and all you've got to do is watch what's going on economically.
[01:03:17.696 --> 01:03:19.597]  You have plenty of reasons to get in.
[01:03:19.597 --> 01:03:25.102]  If you're not scared from your investments that you have in paper right now, you should be, you better take a serious look at that portfolio.
[01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:27.344]  And I want to explain something.
[01:03:27.344 --> 01:03:28.244]  It's artificial.
[01:03:28.244 --> 01:03:33.368]  They are buying the stock market with devalued dollars, so the stock market isn't really $12,000, it's really $6,000.
[01:03:35.825 --> 01:03:37.887]  Okay, I keep trying to explain that.
[01:03:37.887 --> 01:03:44.252]  The stock market is down, and it's only the top 30, and it's down by half.
[01:03:44.252 --> 01:03:45.373]  Let me explain.
[01:03:45.373 --> 01:03:46.854]  The fraud is systemic.
[01:03:46.854 --> 01:03:53.480]  That's why they built FEMA camps, why the cops have been brainwashed, us against them, because they know the globalists are going to take it all.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.321]  And all I'm telling you is try to protect yourself.
[01:03:56.321 --> 01:03:56.461]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:03:56.461 --> 01:03:56.681]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:03:56.681 --> 01:03:59.302]  And again, tell them it's the Alex Jones Special or you'll be paying today's prices.
[01:04:08.183 --> 01:04:10.324]  You know, Ted is a businessman.
[01:04:10.324 --> 01:04:11.785]  You are getting an insane deal.
[01:04:11.785 --> 01:04:18.068]  He does this just to introduce you to gold and silver on my show and to support our listeners that have supported us.
[01:04:18.068 --> 01:04:26.412]  There is literally a paltry 4% add-on to this, and if you look at the increase in last week in prices, you're getting this at below cost.
[01:04:26.732 --> 01:04:27.232]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:04:27.232 --> 01:04:27.973]  800-686-2237.
[01:04:27.973 --> 01:04:35.881]  If you missed that number, minusresources.com.
[01:04:35.881 --> 01:04:37.122]  Ted Anderson, thank you.
[01:04:37.122 --> 01:04:38.203]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:04:38.203 --> 01:04:41.686]  We'll be right back with huge Jesse Ventura 9-11 truth developments.
[01:04:41.686 --> 01:04:42.948]  It's all blowing wide open.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.762]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship.
[01:04:56.762 --> 01:05:00.264]  Martial Law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[01:05:00.264 --> 01:05:02.245]  It's going to be incremental.
[01:05:02.245 --> 01:05:04.226]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[01:05:04.226 --> 01:05:07.308]  Any incident, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[01:05:07.308 --> 01:05:08.789]  Anything could be the final push.
[01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:14.653]  Visit survivemartiallaw.com and download the e-book full of information that will prepare you for life under total military control.
[01:05:14.653 --> 01:05:17.615]  Know how to survive in the conditions that may soon be here on American soil.
[01:05:17.975 --> 01:05:22.859]  Learn how to act around controlling troops, and how to use their own psychology against them through social engineering.
[01:05:22.859 --> 01:05:29.484]  When martial law is officially announced, checkpoints will be enforced, gun confiscations will occur for registered gun owners, and cities will be on lockdown.
[01:05:29.484 --> 01:05:33.347]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years, preparing for this takeover.
[01:05:33.347 --> 01:05:35.288]  Visit survivemartiallaw.com.
[01:05:35.288 --> 01:05:38.030]  When ordering this e-book, you also receive weekly updates.
[01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:40.392]  Visit survivemartiallaw.com, or call 866-644-1933.
[01:05:40.392 --> 01:05:40.712]  That's 866-644-1933.
[01:05:51.209 --> 01:05:53.170]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:56.792]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:05:56.792 --> 01:05:59.254]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:05:59.254 --> 01:06:02.296]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:06:02.296 --> 01:06:08.019]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:06:08.019 --> 01:06:11.942]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:06:12.262 --> 01:06:17.464]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:06:17.464 --> 01:06:20.505]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[01:06:20.505 --> 01:06:27.727]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[01:06:27.727 --> 01:06:33.709]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[01:06:33.709 --> 01:06:38.230]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:41.392]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:06:41.392 --> 01:06:45.695]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:06:59.966 --> 01:07:05.687]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:05.687 --> 01:07:07.168]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:07.168 --> 01:07:16.490]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:18.331]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:07:18.331 --> 01:07:27.553]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:07:27.553 --> 01:07:28.353]  Start saving over
[01:07:28.393 --> 01:07:31.414]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:01.068 --> 01:08:05.211]  Okay, huge new development.
[01:08:05.211 --> 01:08:13.175]  Burmess, being from New York, Jason Burmess of Loose Change fame, down here working with us on a film that he's making called Fabled Enemies.
[01:08:13.175 --> 01:08:21.120]  It gets into some of the foreign governments that were involved, very controversial.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.122]  Burmess is here with us in studio.
[01:08:25.192 --> 01:08:30.354]  And he has listened to most of the hour-long interview with Jesse Mantoro this morning.
[01:08:30.354 --> 01:08:33.536]  In fact, he would only give Stern 40 minutes, a 40-minute interview.
[01:08:33.536 --> 01:08:34.076]  Gave us 50.
[01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:36.217]  That was nice of the governor.
[01:08:36.217 --> 01:08:41.839]  And they start attacking him, and he goes ahead and brings up insurance fraud with blowing up the buildings.
[01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:42.699]  This is huge.
[01:08:42.699 --> 01:08:44.480]  This is big.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.841]  I wanted to bring it yesterday, and I just didn't get around to it.
[01:08:46.841 --> 01:08:48.182]  Who does he think did it?
[01:08:48.182 --> 01:08:48.782]  Why did they do it?
[01:08:48.782 --> 01:08:53.424]  You know, he talked about how he thinks somebody blew it up, and how the government's done stuff before he implied it, but
[01:08:55.203 --> 01:08:56.904]  I didn't get to that, but here it is.
[01:08:56.904 --> 01:08:59.385]  The more he gets attacked, the more he's going to come out.
[01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:01.827]  And then this just gives others the courage to speak out.
[01:09:01.827 --> 01:09:06.769]  Burmese, before we play this five-minute clip, you've heard more than just the five minutes.
[01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:10.131]  Tell us exactly what you heard this morning.
[01:09:10.131 --> 01:09:10.992]  Sure.
[01:09:10.992 --> 01:09:15.354]  Basically, he goes over how the only way that our country would go down is from an internal enemy.
[01:09:15.974 --> 01:09:17.055]  And, uh, that whole thing.
[01:09:17.055 --> 01:09:17.436]  Oh my God.
[01:09:17.436 --> 01:09:18.757]  Yeah, it was great.
[01:09:18.757 --> 01:09:20.639]  Internal enemies carried out 9-11.
[01:09:20.639 --> 01:09:22.581]  Jesse Ventura, we need a headline with that.
[01:09:22.581 --> 01:09:26.125]  Another one on, uh, says 9-11 was insurance fraud.
[01:09:26.125 --> 01:09:26.986]  Oh my God.
[01:09:26.986 --> 01:09:28.407]  Attack right now, man!
[01:09:28.407 --> 01:09:29.989]  Get the articles up, go ahead.
[01:09:29.989 --> 01:09:37.797]  So then he, uh, they bring up, well, you're one of those guys that doesn't think that two planes could bring down three buildings, and he brings up building seven quick, but then he also brings
[01:09:38.417 --> 01:09:46.782]  Up how the World Trade Center Twin Towers weren't making money anymore, and then it was going to cost a billion dollars to take the asbestos out, at least.
[01:09:46.782 --> 01:09:49.883]  And then he mentioned the seven billion dollar insurance scam.
[01:09:49.883 --> 01:09:54.786]  He didn't mention Silverstein by name, but he basically said- But why not just blow him up and let the city breathe it?
[01:09:54.786 --> 01:10:00.429]  That's how you use each New York child and cop and firefighter as a vacuum to get rid of it.
[01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:00.969]  That was cheaper.
[01:10:01.129 --> 01:10:02.750]  Well, demolition was not an option.
[01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:03.930]  That's the other thing.
[01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:07.711]  They were not going to be allowed to demolish the Twin Trade Center and control demolition.
[01:10:07.711 --> 01:10:10.452]  They had to go floor-by-floor to take out the asbestos.
[01:10:10.452 --> 01:10:13.513]  And lo and behold, 9-11 happens and it becomes a non-issue.
[01:10:13.513 --> 01:10:15.834]  So he mentioned, you know, this guy made $7 billion.
[01:10:15.834 --> 01:10:19.475]  All of a sudden, Howard's like, well, man, I guess I'm going to have to read your book.
[01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:22.459]  And he's like, yeah, you really do need to read my book.
[01:10:22.459 --> 01:10:23.941]  So he exposed the insurance scam.
[01:10:23.941 --> 01:10:26.184]  He talked about how he was a demolition expert.
[01:10:26.184 --> 01:10:29.549]  He used the analogy of propane and kerosene.
[01:10:29.549 --> 01:10:32.052]  It was just great because you can't attack Jesse Ventura.
[01:10:32.052 --> 01:10:33.835]  It's very hard to attack him.
[01:10:33.835 --> 01:10:34.856]  They were very friendly to him.
[01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:35.617]  I was pretty surprised.
[01:10:37.043 --> 01:10:45.352]  Well, the little clip I heard was Robin trying to deny, going, well, those buildings had problems, and well, they collapsed because of an Easter Bunny.
[01:10:45.352 --> 01:10:47.014]  Let's be clear here.
[01:10:47.014 --> 01:10:51.179]  NIST has given five reasons it fell, and then they have retracted.
[01:10:51.179 --> 01:10:56.425]  Not the fuel tank, not bad construction, not melting steel, not weakening steel.
[01:10:56.425 --> 01:10:57.987]  They have now had to come in
[01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:02.268]  Not the tower falling, not the North Tower falling into it.
[01:11:02.268 --> 01:11:04.129]  Turns out it only had some windows knocked out.
[01:11:04.129 --> 01:11:05.830]  Palmer Mechanic shows a fake photo.
[01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:07.050]  It's even gray.
[01:11:07.050 --> 01:11:09.931]  The building side, it's not the red building side, brick red.
[01:11:09.931 --> 01:11:11.452]  They show the World Financial Center.
[01:11:11.452 --> 01:11:12.812]  They won't even show the right building.
[01:11:12.812 --> 01:11:14.893]  I mean, that's the type of scams they engage in.
[01:11:14.893 --> 01:11:18.974]  You know, they say NORAD never intercepted anybody in the year before 9-11.
[01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:19.635]  Total lie.
[01:11:19.635 --> 01:11:23.336]  We have Reuters with the head of it saying 160-something times the year before.
[01:11:23.336 --> 01:11:25.837]  I mean, it's just the deception.
[01:11:26.497 --> 01:11:27.178]  Of our enemies.
[01:11:27.178 --> 01:11:32.783]  It's like they're now saying we're lying and there weren't Pentagon videos and others confiscated by the FBI.
[01:11:32.783 --> 01:11:35.986]  When it's all admitted they won't release those tapes, but it doesn't matter.
[01:11:35.986 --> 01:11:36.927]  The public's weak-minded.
[01:11:36.927 --> 01:11:39.569]  They just show video and say we're lying.
[01:11:39.569 --> 01:11:41.311]  I mean, this is the level of disorder.
[01:11:41.311 --> 01:11:44.234]  They bring out black propaganda and that's where you
[01:11:45.091 --> 01:12:03.051]  Going back to JFK, folks, he would have cops and FBI and coroners who were going to testify, and they'd be totally normal, 30-40 year careers, totally normal, 25 year careers, and they get up on stand and say, I am a space alien, or they get up on stand and say, I fingerprint my daughter every day to make sure they haven't, you know, taken her.
[01:12:03.811 --> 01:12:08.552]  Uh, I'm a fingerprinting expert, and then go, you know, I mean, that's what they do.
[01:12:08.552 --> 01:12:10.793]  And so Stern is having black propaganda on.
[01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:13.634]  I mean, if I wanted to have them over a barrel, I could.
[01:12:13.634 --> 01:12:17.695]  My God, the slander is just, just the worst stuff they can say is being said.
[01:12:17.695 --> 01:12:21.136]  Then they have Ventura on, and I haven't had a chance to hear it all yet.
[01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:25.737]  Let's go ahead and play a few minutes of this to analyze enemy propaganda.
[01:12:25.737 --> 01:12:26.037]  Here it is.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:33.664]  Hey, you're one of those guys who believes, you know, that 9-11, that you don't believe two planes knocked down three buildings, right?
[01:12:33.664 --> 01:12:53.315]  Well, I believed it when it happened, and then after I got out of office, my son kept badgering me to pay attention to these things on the internet, and I finally did, and I started studying it, and I started opening my eyes a little, and there's a lot of very difficult questions that have not been answered, and no one seems to want to provide an answer.
[01:12:53.315 --> 01:12:55.116]  What's the most difficult question that you see?
[01:12:55.796 --> 01:13:02.500]  A third building could fall into its own footprint five hours later, having not been struck by much of anything.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.721]  So what do you think happened?
[01:13:04.721 --> 01:13:05.701]  How did that happen?
[01:13:05.701 --> 01:13:08.683]  The 9-11 Commission didn't even address the issue.
[01:13:08.683 --> 01:13:11.284]  So what do you think happened?
[01:13:11.284 --> 01:13:15.487]  I hate to fear what could have happened, but possibly we did it to ourselves.
[01:13:15.947 --> 01:13:16.929]  You're kidding me!
[01:13:16.929 --> 01:13:24.824]  Well, Howard, I worked in demolition and was trained by the best guys in the United States Navy, being a frogman.
[01:13:24.824 --> 01:13:27.649]  And how could those buildings fall at the rate of gravity?
[01:13:28.286 --> 01:13:29.827]  Well, let me ask you something.
[01:13:29.827 --> 01:13:39.209]  I don't know much about this, but when jets go right into a building, couldn't there be so much trauma to the area that things can fall?
[01:13:39.209 --> 01:13:48.252]  No, because if you study how they built the buildings, those buildings were made to withstand a 707, which is that old plane with the four engines on the wing.
[01:13:48.252 --> 01:13:48.832]  Right.
[01:13:48.832 --> 01:13:51.013]  Well, that's as big as what hit it.
[01:13:51.013 --> 01:13:57.775]  And by my studying, they said it was built to where if a plane penetrated it, it would be like a pencil going through a
[01:13:59.016 --> 01:14:14.248]  But it seems unthinkable to me that our own government, I mean, this would be... You're talking about power, you're talking about foreign policy changing over this event, you're talking about getting control of the Middle Eastern oil.
[01:14:14.248 --> 01:14:17.770]  You think Bush is smart enough to pull off something like that?
[01:14:17.770 --> 01:14:19.512]  Hit pause for a minute.
[01:14:19.512 --> 01:14:21.694]  Hit pause, back it up.
[01:14:21.694 --> 01:14:23.315]  Again, we all have blind spots.
[01:14:24.082 --> 01:14:25.603]  And I have had Ventura on.
[01:14:25.603 --> 01:14:28.726]  He broke that he's on I Love & Truth or on this show a month and a half ago.
[01:14:28.726 --> 01:14:30.527]  And then they said they wanted to come back on.
[01:14:30.527 --> 01:14:31.688]  They knew it had a great response.
[01:14:31.688 --> 01:14:34.190]  And, you know, he likes the films and what we do.
[01:14:34.190 --> 01:14:36.792]  And so I get him back on and he says, oh man, they're really attacking me.
[01:14:36.792 --> 01:14:39.854]  And then the one question, because I was thinking the night before, what do I ask?
[01:14:39.854 --> 01:14:41.175]  And I wrote some notes here.
[01:14:41.175 --> 01:14:42.716]  The one question was, well, who did it?
[01:14:42.716 --> 01:14:43.397]  Why'd they do it?
[01:14:43.397 --> 01:14:44.718]  You know, what's the motive?
[01:14:44.718 --> 01:14:49.381]  And of course, I talked about that with him two years ago in an interview where he said they might have done it.
[01:14:49.381 --> 01:14:51.182]  You know, where he first started to talk.
[01:14:51.182 --> 01:14:52.443]  That was even before he'd seen loose change.
[01:14:52.443 --> 01:14:53.264]  I pushed him over the edge.
[01:14:54.065 --> 01:14:55.688]  And I gave him some of my films.
[01:14:55.688 --> 01:14:59.555]  But I was literally waking up last night mad that I hadn't asked that question.
[01:14:59.555 --> 01:15:02.641]  And then, thank God, he just says it on Stern, so we now have it.
[01:15:02.641 --> 01:15:03.863]  And then he brought the insurance thing.
[01:15:03.863 --> 01:15:04.905]  This is gonna go crazy.
[01:15:07.953 --> 01:15:10.294]  Our government may have done 9-11, that's the headline.
[01:15:10.294 --> 01:15:13.456]  Another headline, insurance fraud.
[01:15:13.456 --> 01:15:21.361]  We need multiple articles, attack pattern Delta, tying in the video we got him a few days ago and the audio we've got here with all of it.
[01:15:21.361 --> 01:15:25.283]  And then challenging, we need articles because new people are going to be seeing this, that
[01:15:25.863 --> 01:15:26.924]  Go through it all!
[01:15:56.423 --> 01:16:09.489]  Well, what they're going to try to do with building 7 is go by their pattern where they're not allowed to look at floors below, I believe it's either the 11th or the 7th floor at all.
[01:16:09.489 --> 01:16:12.890]  And we know that's where a lot of the damage on the front side of the building was.
[01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:21.134]  We also know that the eyewitnesses that were inside the building that were blown up on the 8th floor, you know, said that there were multiple explosions inside the building.
[01:16:21.374 --> 01:16:25.457]  So what they're going to do is they're going to take that 8th floor and bring it down and never even mention those.
[01:16:25.457 --> 01:16:37.466]  And they're going to say something happened on the 9th or 10th floor that caused instability in the building, that probably caused those fuel tanks to go up, and I believe there was also a large, uh, what is it, power generator there too.
[01:16:37.466 --> 01:16:39.748]  I'm sure that's going to fit into play as well.
[01:16:39.748 --> 01:16:41.989]  But here we are, Alex, we're almost 7 years later.
[01:16:41.989 --> 01:16:43.250]  Still no NIST report.
[01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:45.372]  And the guy that's heading this NIST report, I think it's
[01:16:45.828 --> 01:16:46.609]  It's just totally made up.
[01:16:46.609 --> 01:16:46.809]  It's just...
[01:17:00.174 --> 01:17:02.094]  That's like saying Godzilla ate the building.
[01:17:02.094 --> 01:17:03.055]  It just didn't happen.
[01:17:03.055 --> 01:17:04.555]  Absolutely, and we have the video to prove it.
[01:17:04.555 --> 01:17:09.096]  We literally have the video after at least one of the buildings has collapsed of the south face of the building.
[01:17:09.096 --> 01:17:11.517]  Some of the glass is blown out, but some of the doors are still there.
[01:17:11.517 --> 01:17:15.818]  Then they go inside and they literally go through the lobby up into the second floor.
[01:17:15.818 --> 01:17:18.058]  In fact, that footage is in Truth Rising.
[01:17:18.058 --> 01:17:19.839]  I think you're going to show some of that in your film.
[01:17:19.839 --> 01:17:20.319]  Yep.
[01:17:20.319 --> 01:17:23.460]  And there they are, the facade of the building with a few windows broken out.
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.800]  And they show a gray-sided building.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.701]  The building was brick red.
[01:17:27.701 --> 01:17:29.581]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:17:30.706 --> 01:17:32.387]  They show the World Financial Center.
[01:17:32.387 --> 01:17:34.088]  I mean, these people are incredible.
[01:17:34.088 --> 01:17:43.692]  Yeah, and when we asked them, when we did our debate with Popular Mechanics, where they got that photograph from, or why they were able to see photographs that still weren't public, and we hadn't seen them.
[01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:44.552]  Oh yeah, they've been saying that.
[01:17:44.552 --> 01:17:45.853]  We've been shown secret photos.
[01:17:45.853 --> 01:17:48.274]  Yeah, we've been shown photos that no one else is allowed to see.
[01:17:48.274 --> 01:17:49.154]  Why?
[01:17:49.154 --> 01:17:49.995]  What's the big deal?
[01:17:49.995 --> 01:17:51.155]  Why isn't all this stuff public?
[01:17:51.155 --> 01:17:54.517]  If they have pictures that we don't have, why not show them to the public?
[01:17:54.517 --> 01:17:57.999]  Well, look, I had firefighters months after it happened sending me disks with hundreds of high-res.
[01:17:57.999 --> 01:17:58.839]  Some of those are in the film.
[01:17:59.299 --> 01:18:01.181]  We even put some on the web a few years ago.
[01:18:01.181 --> 01:18:03.282]  These are giant government cameras.
[01:18:03.282 --> 01:18:04.703]  Even back then they were huge pixels.
[01:18:04.703 --> 01:18:09.166]  10, 20 megapixel, whatever.
[01:18:09.166 --> 01:18:11.588]  High quality from 7 years ago.
[01:18:11.588 --> 01:18:14.650]  And you see it, and it's got some windows out.
[01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:17.492]  It shows other buildings on fire.
[01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:19.994]  You know, some of the smaller ones that got crushed but didn't fall.
[01:18:19.994 --> 01:18:24.137]  And in World War II, the Russians coming into Berlin would attack old buildings.
[01:18:24.873 --> 01:18:28.937]  With giant artillery and aircraft for days and they wouldn't collapse.
[01:18:28.937 --> 01:18:30.559]  The facade was still up.
[01:18:30.559 --> 01:18:36.164]  I mean you don't just like have a fuel oil tank go off and then all everything symmetrically collapses perfectly.
[01:18:36.164 --> 01:18:36.985]  Let's go back to the tape.
[01:18:37.472 --> 01:18:40.012]  I think there are people capable of doing it.
[01:18:40.012 --> 01:18:42.673]  And I'm not saying that it didn't happen.
[01:18:42.673 --> 01:18:46.914]  All I'm saying is that... Take jet fuel, for example.
[01:18:46.914 --> 01:18:48.534]  It's kerosene.
[01:18:48.534 --> 01:18:51.034]  Kerosene doesn't burn very hot.
[01:18:51.034 --> 01:19:01.856]  They're telling us that a kerosene-based fuel melted these steel concrete girders in a giant building so it would simply collapse to the ground.
[01:19:01.856 --> 01:19:04.197]  But it collapsed in all powder.
[01:19:04.197 --> 01:19:05.937]  Wouldn't it come down in big chunks?
[01:19:06.837 --> 01:19:11.662]  The thing is, is the fire caused the columns to weaken and the sagging floors, as we call it, the building to implode.
[01:19:11.662 --> 01:19:28.619]  Oh, if that's the case, okay, if that's the case, if you use that analogy, then when you go camping and use a propane stove, which propane burns hotter than kerosene does, if you leave it on for two hours and you put a big can of beans on your grill, shouldn't the grill collapse?
[01:19:29.691 --> 01:19:30.932]  See that Fred?
[01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:35.196]  It's not that much weight and it's not that much heat.
[01:19:51.997 --> 01:19:55.759]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:19:55.759 --> 01:20:00.783]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:20:00.783 --> 01:20:06.266]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:20:06.266 --> 01:20:16.753]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:20:17.233 --> 01:20:21.636]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:20:21.636 --> 01:20:24.418]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:20:24.418 --> 01:20:27.981]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:20:27.981 --> 01:20:40.510]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:44.695]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[01:20:44.695 --> 01:20:49.001]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them dot com.
[01:20:49.001 --> 01:20:50.263]  The message of His Kingdom.
[01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:57.693]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:57.693 --> 01:21:05.816]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:05.816 --> 01:21:13.639]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:13.979 --> 01:21:19.061]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:19.061 --> 01:21:24.282]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:24.282 --> 01:21:28.644]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:28.644 --> 01:21:29.724]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:23:37.922 --> 01:23:37.962]  239-628-3708.
[01:24:05.295 --> 01:24:15.238]  Okay, let's go back to this clip of Howard Stern and Jesse Ventura as we analyze the way they try to counter him.
[01:24:15.238 --> 01:24:15.898]  Here it is.
[01:24:33.024 --> 01:24:34.685]  See that, Fred?
[01:24:34.685 --> 01:24:41.511]  It's not that much weight and it's not that much heat.
[01:24:41.511 --> 01:24:47.735]  I don't eat beans.
[01:24:47.735 --> 01:24:50.898]  Gee, I mean... See, that's crazy!
[01:24:50.898 --> 01:24:58.504]  Like, even when you say that the planes were made to go through a certain way, you've never seen anything that was built to work a certain way, but you never know until something happens?
[01:25:02.907 --> 01:25:07.128]  Yeah, but they didn't build the buildings to code.
[01:25:07.128 --> 01:25:11.709]  They scrimped and they didn't do everything they were supposed to do.
[01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:13.989]  Hit pause, back it up ten seconds.
[01:25:13.989 --> 01:25:16.469]  Again, NHTSA said they looked at it.
[01:25:16.469 --> 01:25:18.150]  They were built to code.
[01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:20.170]  They were underwritten by underwriting laboratories.
[01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:23.131]  They internally did their own test and found that it had to be bombs.
[01:25:23.131 --> 01:25:26.011]  When Kevin Ryan released that, he got fired.
[01:25:26.011 --> 01:25:28.972]  So just more bull from these people.
[01:25:28.972 --> 01:25:31.412]  And we were planning this as a public service to show you the deception.
[01:25:32.213 --> 01:25:34.176]  Uh, of these individuals.
[01:25:34.176 --> 01:25:35.638]  Uh, Burmish, you got comments to that?
[01:25:35.638 --> 01:25:39.524]  Yeah, I mean, Underwriters Laboratory, uh, certified the steel structure.
[01:25:39.524 --> 01:25:42.348]  In other words, they had, uh, floor models there.
[01:25:43.152 --> 01:25:46.255]  After the fact, also, that did not collapse, Alex.
[01:25:46.255 --> 01:25:53.182]  They subjected them to higher temperatures for longer periods of time, and the best they could do was have them sag.
[01:25:53.182 --> 01:25:54.504]  It's an utter lie.
[01:25:54.504 --> 01:25:57.366]  We know that, you know, I've heard that before.
[01:25:57.366 --> 01:25:59.348]  The buildings weren't brought to code.
[01:25:59.348 --> 01:26:01.110]  It's a total fabrication.
[01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:02.712]  And the disturbing part is I've heard that
[01:26:03.514 --> 01:26:13.983]  Uh, come out of, uh, some of the 9-11 truthers, or supposed 9-11 truthers' mouths, that this was Mafia Bell, and the concrete was light, and it was lightweight steel in the core, or that there's no core at all.
[01:26:13.983 --> 01:26:17.746]  I'm sure you've heard that one, Alex.
[01:26:17.746 --> 01:26:22.309]  Oh, they, they engage in just every form of, of deception you can imagine.
[01:26:22.309 --> 01:26:23.250]  Let's finish up with a clip.
[01:26:24.105 --> 01:26:26.046]  Yeah, but they didn't build the buildings to code.
[01:26:26.046 --> 01:26:28.946]  They scrimped and they didn't do everything they were supposed to do.
[01:26:28.946 --> 01:26:30.447]  Well, let's look at the history of the buildings.
[01:26:30.447 --> 01:26:32.827]  These two buildings were white elephants.
[01:26:32.827 --> 01:26:42.770]  They were losing money, they had asbestos in there, and they were being required by law to do over a billion dollars worth of asbestos removal.
[01:26:43.897 --> 01:26:47.402]  So you think somebody might have sabotaged it?
[01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:48.924]  It was an insurance job?
[01:26:48.924 --> 01:26:49.244]  Wow.
[01:26:49.244 --> 01:26:51.447]  I might have to read your book.
[01:26:51.447 --> 01:26:54.070]  It's called Don't Start the Revolution Without Me.
[01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.711]  It's in stores now.
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:04.721]  By Jesse Ventura, Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:27:04.721 --> 01:27:10.221]  And you even believe, you're one of those guys, you don't even believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone against the Kennedy assassination.
[01:27:10.221 --> 01:27:12.942]  No, I do not, because I've studied it for over 20 years.
[01:27:12.942 --> 01:27:14.722]  Stop right there, back it up again.
[01:27:14.722 --> 01:27:17.163]  Okay.
[01:27:17.163 --> 01:27:22.344]  In every major poll, it is now over 90% of Americans believe the government killed Kennedy.
[01:27:22.344 --> 01:27:29.925]  They've now come out on the BBC and NBC showing the film footage at the Ambassador Hotel of three CIA section chiefs from Asia.
[01:27:30.613 --> 01:27:33.425]  The famous guys involved with Kennedy with JFK as well.
[01:27:34.261 --> 01:27:45.309]  It's admitted that the guy that shot RFK behind him, who the coroner said shot him from behind, Mr. Caesar, was CIA.
[01:27:45.309 --> 01:27:50.433]  And we have the footage of all these guys there directing Caesar and others right before it happens.
[01:27:50.433 --> 01:27:59.440]  We now have the son releasing the video we have at the audio of the guy that was photographed being at the scene by the Dallas Morning News and Dallas Times Herald.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.841]  And that of course, E. Howard Hunt,
[01:28:01.664 --> 01:28:03.685]  I mean, Jason, when does it end?
[01:28:03.685 --> 01:28:04.406]  It doesn't end.
[01:28:04.406 --> 01:28:11.930]  I mean, uh, you know, that interview is almost over and they ridicule him for believing that Oswald was not the lone assassin after he's off the air.
[01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:15.893]  But, just go to the videotape of the Secret Service by Kennedy that day.
[01:28:15.893 --> 01:28:24.038]  As they're turning the corner at Dealey Plaza, one of the Secret Service agents at the back of his car actually gets called off, and he's not happy about it, Alex.
[01:28:24.038 --> 01:28:26.539]  He starts yelling and saying, no, I'm not gonna do it.
[01:28:26.539 --> 01:28:29.001]  No, somebody ought to get this video online and add that video over it.
[01:28:29.822 --> 01:28:33.025]  Our great listeners, we don't have the personnel, but you can take it and put it all together for folks.
[01:28:33.025 --> 01:28:35.328]  And it shows a couple of them actually going, what?
[01:28:35.328 --> 01:28:36.349]  What are you saying?
[01:28:36.349 --> 01:28:39.392]  And then they later said that all procedures were blocked.
[01:28:39.392 --> 01:28:42.316]  You got LBJ behind them in the radio calling in the assault.
[01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:44.578]  Get ready, we're going with sniper position one.
[01:28:44.578 --> 01:28:47.041]  Because they had kill zones all the way down to the airport.
[01:28:47.582 --> 01:28:52.590]  They were going to keep, you know, they were ready with hand grenade attacks, bazooka attacks.
[01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:55.936]  If they had to, they were going to have military kill him and go to full martial law.
[01:28:55.936 --> 01:28:59.663]  They had riot troops in the air from the army flying above Dallas and
[01:29:00.794 --> 01:29:11.357]  Hours before Oswald's name came out, when the police were first, you know, minutes after he's, uh, Kennedy's killed, it's already published in New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, that Lee Harvey Oswald did it.
[01:29:11.357 --> 01:29:11.817]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:11.817 --> 01:29:12.397]  Open and shut.
[01:29:12.397 --> 01:29:15.498]  I mean, just like they announced Building 7 blew up before it blew up.
[01:29:15.498 --> 01:29:15.898]  Absolutely.
[01:29:15.898 --> 01:29:19.779]  In fact, uh, Jonathan Elanoff from We Are Change Colorado has that.
[01:29:19.779 --> 01:29:20.499]  He got it from eBay.
[01:29:20.499 --> 01:29:26.021]  He's got the cover paper where they're literally blaming Oswald for the assassination before it happens.
[01:29:26.021 --> 01:29:28.041]  I mean, think, think for yourselves, people.
[01:29:28.041 --> 01:29:29.802]  If they can print this before an event,
[01:29:30.442 --> 01:29:32.163]  It's obviously not that guy.
[01:29:32.163 --> 01:29:33.664]  They got their time zones off.
[01:29:33.664 --> 01:29:33.884]  Yeah.
[01:29:33.884 --> 01:29:34.804]  I mean, they're going to make mistakes.
[01:29:34.804 --> 01:29:36.025]  The government's not perfect.
[01:29:36.025 --> 01:29:37.005]  They're not invincible.
[01:29:37.005 --> 01:29:38.046]  Barmos, thanks for coming in.
[01:29:38.046 --> 01:29:39.126]  Thank you.
[01:29:39.126 --> 01:29:41.788]  Well, let's talk during this break.
[01:29:41.788 --> 01:29:43.168]  We're on the march.
[01:29:43.168 --> 01:29:45.709]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:48.411]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.786 --> 01:29:55.589]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[01:29:55.589 --> 01:29:59.732]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[01:29:59.732 --> 01:30:06.557]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worse toll taken by antibiotics.
[01:30:06.557 --> 01:30:09.439]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[01:30:09.819 --> 01:30:19.225]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[01:30:19.225 --> 01:30:23.889]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[01:30:23.889 --> 01:30:27.011]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[01:30:27.011 --> 01:30:33.455]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more.
[01:30:33.455 --> 01:30:39.459]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with Oxysilver.
[01:30:39.839 --> 01:30:42.201]  Order your supply now by calling toll-free 1-877-817-9829.
[01:30:42.201 --> 01:30:42.982]  That's 1-877-817-9829.
[01:30:42.982 --> 01:30:43.682]  Do it now.
[01:30:43.682 --> 01:30:45.864]  It is a big idea.
[01:30:45.864 --> 01:30:47.665]  A new world order.
[01:30:47.665 --> 01:30:57.793]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:30:57.793 --> 01:31:03.698]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:31:03.698 --> 01:31:05.860]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:31:06.462 --> 01:31:09.646]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:31:09.646 --> 01:31:16.976]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.424]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:31:25.424 --> 01:31:29.326]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:31:29.326 --> 01:31:31.868]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:31:31.868 --> 01:31:33.049]  Most people have no idea.
[01:31:33.049 --> 01:31:33.829]  They're not after money.
[01:31:33.829 --> 01:31:35.110]  They have all the money they need.
[01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:36.071]  They're after power.
[01:31:36.071 --> 01:31:37.232]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[01:31:37.232 --> 01:31:41.995]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:31:45.957 --> 01:31:46.718]  Endgame.
[01:31:46.718 --> 01:31:48.759]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:31:48.759 --> 01:31:49.820]  You have been warned.
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:51.120]  We're good.
[01:32:06.707 --> 01:32:09.949]  Many people say that it gives them a whole new outlook on life.
[01:32:09.949 --> 01:32:13.391]  Ask someone who wears one, or better yet, try one for yourself.
[01:32:13.391 --> 01:32:17.473]  The silver band with gold terminals is still the most popular and a best seller.
[01:32:17.473 --> 01:32:24.357]  The balance bracelet has no magnets, but is ionized in such a way that wearers are so delighted they refuse to ever take theirs off.

[01:32:48.277 --> 01:32:49.859]  Offer not available in California.
[01:33:05.405 --> 01:33:31.894]  In constant sorrow through his day I am the man of constant sorrow I've seen trouble all my day I bid farewell to old Kentucky
[01:33:33.737 --> 01:33:39.210]  The place where I was born and raised.
[01:33:39.210 --> 01:33:43.559]  The place where he was born and raised.
[01:34:03.003 --> 01:34:06.833]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:34:06.833 --> 01:34:08.397]  This is very, very exciting.
[01:34:09.617 --> 01:34:15.482]  Jesse Ventura, a month and a half ago, out of the blue, went public saying 9-11 was an inside job on my show.
[01:34:15.482 --> 01:34:19.305]  He said, yeah, two years ago, when you gave me your videos, I wasn't quite convinced.
[01:34:19.305 --> 01:34:21.087]  I knew they'd staged other events.
[01:34:21.087 --> 01:34:23.088]  I'd gone to the Tonkin and seen Northwoods.
[01:34:23.088 --> 01:34:25.771]  And that's in my film, of course, Terror Storm.
[01:34:25.771 --> 01:34:28.153]  But he said, now I'm ready to go public.
[01:34:28.153 --> 01:34:31.235]  I've read 16 books and watched Loose Change, and I agree with you.
[01:34:31.235 --> 01:34:33.197]  And that's actually at the end of my new film.
[01:34:33.197 --> 01:34:35.739]  First time folks saw that was at two movie showings we did.
[01:34:35.739 --> 01:34:37.801]  The off-the-air discussions between me and Ventura.
[01:34:40.435 --> 01:34:45.616]  We're going to be posting those up on the web soon.
[01:34:45.616 --> 01:34:46.477]  This is life and death.
[01:34:46.477 --> 01:34:50.498]  If we don't expose the criminal element, stage the attacks.
[01:34:50.498 --> 01:34:52.058]  It's over.
[01:34:52.058 --> 01:34:52.979]  They're going to do it more.
[01:34:52.979 --> 01:34:53.719]  They're going to win.
[01:34:53.719 --> 01:34:54.899]  They're going to use the FEMA camps.
[01:34:54.899 --> 01:34:56.239]  It's all going to happen.
[01:34:56.239 --> 01:34:57.980]  This is life and death for this Republic.
[01:34:59.055 --> 01:35:03.137]  And we've got a story about Ventura up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:03.137 --> 01:35:06.479]  Ventura slams media witch hunt for Question 9-11.
[01:35:06.479 --> 01:35:07.879]  There's one that Nemo did last night.
[01:35:07.879 --> 01:35:11.701]  There's two more about to go up in the next hour on Prison Planet and InfoWars.
[01:35:11.701 --> 01:35:18.204]  One with Ventura talks about insurance fraud to destroy the buildings and get rid of the asbestos.
[01:35:18.204 --> 01:35:19.825]  And he said, it looks like our government did it.
[01:35:19.825 --> 01:35:21.686]  He said, you know, it looks like we did it.
[01:35:21.686 --> 01:35:25.428]  And he explained that he's a demolitions expert in underwater demolitions.
[01:35:26.052 --> 01:35:27.893]  That's what he did before he was a Navy SEAL.
[01:35:27.893 --> 01:35:30.775]  Those guys are highly trained, and that's what it is.
[01:35:30.775 --> 01:35:33.876]  And this needs to get out, folks.
[01:35:33.876 --> 01:35:34.637]  This is big.
[01:35:34.637 --> 01:35:37.858]  We need to make sure the mainstream media is forced to attack him.
[01:35:37.858 --> 01:35:41.960]  He told me privately, he said, I know they're going to attack me, but at least they'll bring the truth out.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:48.064]  And I might even take those behind-the-scenes things, just put them up, and I'd tell him, hey, we're recording this during the breaks, and I'd talk to him more.
[01:35:48.064 --> 01:35:52.186]  But we just really, really need to get
[01:35:53.150 --> 01:35:58.034]  I'm asking you listeners to not play games, to not stand by, to not screw around.
[01:35:58.034 --> 01:36:01.237]  We also need funds, and I hope you'll support our sponsors.
[01:36:01.237 --> 01:36:04.459]  I also hope you'll sign up for the Money Bomb.
[01:36:04.459 --> 01:36:09.603]  I mean, I know we'll use the money 100% in my pledge to fight the New World Order.
[01:36:09.603 --> 01:36:11.505]  Go to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[01:36:11.505 --> 01:36:13.566]  I didn't think the idea up.
[01:36:13.566 --> 01:36:14.247]  A listener did.
[01:36:14.247 --> 01:36:18.771]  The same guy that originally came up with the idea put up the first website that Trevor Lyman picked up on it.
[01:36:18.771 --> 01:36:20.412]  This is separate from Trevor Lyman and that group.
[01:36:21.318 --> 01:36:25.322]  And, uh, this is, uh, what Mr. Nordstrom put up.
[01:36:25.322 --> 01:36:29.106]  And, uh, it's about $46,000 been pledged there.
[01:36:29.106 --> 01:36:34.571]  You know, I mean, if Ron Paul can raise $15 million off money bombs, I wish we could raise a million.
[01:36:34.571 --> 01:36:39.496]  Because my pledge is, I would spend that to go to the next level immediately.
[01:36:39.496 --> 01:36:45.022]  I mean, I would put up our own servers for unlimited video, uh, uploading and streaming out.
[01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:49.292]  I mean, with that, for a couple years, I could rival YouTube.
[01:36:49.292 --> 01:36:53.256]  I mean, it would really, the amount of money we could buy with that.
[01:36:53.256 --> 01:36:55.058]  The studio.
[01:36:55.058 --> 01:36:56.439]  The TV show we could develop.
[01:36:56.439 --> 01:36:57.821]  I mean, fast.
[01:36:57.821 --> 01:36:59.142]  I can do stuff quick.
[01:36:59.142 --> 01:37:08.091]  I'd hire two more IT guys, I'd hire three or four camera people, PR people, you know, for setting up interviews, producers.
[01:37:08.091 --> 01:37:10.053]  But I don't have the money to do that, so it'll end up being
[01:37:10.851 --> 01:37:17.495]  About 11 of us that are actually in the fight against the New World Order here, doing the work of tens of thousands, because of you, the listeners, taking action.
[01:37:17.495 --> 01:37:20.957]  So sign up for InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[01:37:20.957 --> 01:37:23.239]  That's next Saturday, not this Saturday, but next Saturday.
[01:37:23.239 --> 01:37:24.520]  That's the day they chose.
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:31.144]  I would probably chose a Friday or a Wednesday or so, but they did other money bombs on the weekend, so.
[01:37:31.144 --> 01:37:34.926]  My commitment, 100%, my word, of the money will go to fight the New World Order.
[01:37:36.581 --> 01:37:41.845]  I know that's hard for the average person to believe, but I'm completely unworldly, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:41.845 --> 01:37:44.167]  I've been very, quote, manly.
[01:37:44.167 --> 01:37:45.288]  I'm married.
[01:37:45.288 --> 01:37:46.209]  I have three children.
[01:37:46.209 --> 01:37:48.010]  I like women a lot.
[01:37:48.010 --> 01:37:50.673]  I love my wife, but I'm not even into that anymore.
[01:37:50.673 --> 01:37:51.994]  All I think about is this.
[01:37:51.994 --> 01:37:55.156]  I am completely dedicated.
[01:37:55.156 --> 01:37:56.798]  I am just constant.
[01:37:56.798 --> 01:37:58.499]  This is all I am.
[01:37:58.499 --> 01:38:00.120]  This is who I am.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.181]  And we need your support.
[01:38:03.064 --> 01:38:10.830]  I know the Money Bomb, the Ron Paul stars kind of faded, done a lot of great work, woke a lot of people up, so the idea of Money Bomb is kind of hooked to that pony.
[01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:15.453]  But this is exciting, and what this could do for other activist groups.
[01:38:15.453 --> 01:38:20.997]  So I'm asking you to go pledge $5, $10, $100, whatever, and you have my word that we'll fight the war with it.
[01:38:20.997 --> 01:38:21.777]  We need your support.
[01:38:21.777 --> 01:38:24.399]  Or if you just want to write me a check and say it's for the Money Bomb, 100%.
[01:38:26.576 --> 01:38:28.598]  We'll go to fight the New World Order.
[01:38:28.598 --> 01:38:32.821]  And I'll live off my meager video sales and the other things I do.
[01:38:32.821 --> 01:38:37.665]  But you have my commitment that 100%, no other quote, charity does that.
[01:38:37.665 --> 01:38:39.166]  Of course, it's not tax exempt either.
[01:38:39.166 --> 01:38:41.268]  We're not under government control.
[01:38:41.268 --> 01:38:45.831]  It'll end up, you know, I'll spend it on equipment and buildings and things, so tax man won't get much of it.
[01:38:45.831 --> 01:38:50.455]  That's the good news, is that the tax man won't get any of it, really, because I'll spend it all on equipment.
[01:38:51.529 --> 01:38:52.550]  Um, and personnel.
[01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:53.251]  They will get money.
[01:38:53.251 --> 01:39:01.877]  The government will get some of the money through the taxes that my employees pay, because we do pay the government taxes to the IRS, to the Federal Reserve, because we're choosing our battles here.
[01:39:01.877 --> 01:39:07.601]  Uh, you know, we're not... I mean, I commend those that don't pay the taxes and protest it.
[01:39:07.601 --> 01:39:09.583]  I'm saying we pick our battles.
[01:39:09.583 --> 01:39:13.065]  I could be like Wesley Snipes going off to prison, uh, for three years or whatever.
[01:39:13.065 --> 01:39:17.348]  Okay, let's shift gears now to Marty the Soapman.
[01:39:17.348 --> 01:39:19.610]  We have a couple of our top sponsors on once a month.
[01:39:21.710 --> 01:39:23.511]  And Marty Schachter is that man.
[01:39:23.511 --> 01:39:26.952]  He was in the Chemical Corps in World War II.
[01:39:26.952 --> 01:39:31.034]  His father and he, in 1947, started Calvin Pure Soap.
[01:39:31.034 --> 01:39:34.316]  I'd seen it in one nice hotel I was in, once in D.C.
[01:39:34.316 --> 01:39:35.096]  with my parents.
[01:39:35.096 --> 01:39:36.897]  I had seen it at a hospital once.
[01:39:36.897 --> 01:39:41.479]  They only sold to institutions until Genesis got them to advertise five, six years ago.
[01:39:41.479 --> 01:39:44.260]  So you're getting factory direct from Oakland, California.
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:46.981]  That's why you save 85% off supermarket prices.
[01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:51.203]  And Marty, let me ask you, out of the gates, with this fine organic soap,
[01:39:53.171 --> 01:39:57.113]  Well, first, I want to thank you for talking to me and giving me the opportunity to talk to your listeners.
[01:39:57.113 --> 01:39:59.414]  But I have in my hands statistical evidence proving
[01:40:19.696 --> 01:40:23.737]  What it costs a consumer now in the marketplace.
[01:40:23.737 --> 01:40:35.800]  And the evidence reads somewhere between 17 cents and 20.8 cents of every dollar is spent on a cleaning product in the marketplace.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:41.142]  Now, figuring out a minimum that a family could spend like a hundred dollars a week
[01:40:41.832 --> 01:40:45.033]  Which is a $19.95 figure.
[01:40:45.033 --> 01:40:47.934]  $100 a week for everything they need in the marketplace.
[01:40:47.934 --> 01:40:52.456]  Approximately 20% of that goes for cleaning products.
[01:40:52.456 --> 01:40:57.918]  For bath soap and hair soap and dish soap and laundry soap and all-purpose cleaner and floor cleaner and window cleaner.
[01:40:57.918 --> 01:41:00.599]  An endless array of cleaning chemicals.
[01:41:00.599 --> 01:41:02.100]  So if they're spending $20 a week,
[01:41:03.573 --> 01:41:09.516]  That adds up to over $1,000 a year going down the drain with nothing to show for it.
[01:41:09.516 --> 01:41:11.337]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[01:41:11.337 --> 01:41:12.177]  I know a lot of vets.
[01:41:12.177 --> 01:41:15.479]  I worked for a small animal vet, large animal vet for several years total.
[01:41:15.479 --> 01:41:18.660]  And I remember them complaining 15, 16, 17 years ago.
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:19.981]  I guess longer than that.
[01:41:19.981 --> 01:41:21.842]  I guess in one case, 20 years ago.
[01:41:21.842 --> 01:41:24.363]  Man, I'm getting old.
[01:41:24.363 --> 01:41:26.424]  And, you know, when I worked for them, and they would talk about
[01:41:27.626 --> 01:41:31.347]  Hey, these vaccines are good for five years, eight years.
[01:41:31.347 --> 01:41:34.467]  The rabies shot good for nine to twelve, depending on which type it is.
[01:41:34.467 --> 01:41:36.668]  Why do they make them give it each year?
[01:41:36.668 --> 01:41:38.028]  And it's a moneymaker.
[01:41:38.028 --> 01:41:38.708]  It's the same thing.
[01:41:38.708 --> 01:41:45.450]  I read all the studies about how you need a thimble of soap to clean clothes, but so they use masses of toxic detergent.
[01:41:45.450 --> 01:41:51.831]  They've built in fraud and trained us how to live in a fraud.
[01:41:51.831 --> 01:41:57.192]  I want to give you a counter to that $20 a week consumer spending in round figures.
[01:41:57.893 --> 01:42:05.897]  If he bought from... We offer a one-year supply, which could last an average family anywhere from 12 to 24 months, for $145.
[01:42:05.897 --> 01:42:09.518]  On top of that, we add $45 for shipping coast to coast, 3,000 miles.
[01:42:09.518 --> 01:42:13.020]  Obviously, if you're 1,500 miles or 1,800 miles or 1,000 miles, it's much lower.
[01:42:22.014 --> 01:42:35.504]  But a total maximum cost of $190 for a year versus the difference of $1,000 a year, that gives you over an 80% savings.
[01:42:35.504 --> 01:42:36.445]  Over that.
[01:42:36.445 --> 01:42:40.949]  Because we have to calculate the difference in the shipping, no sales tax.
[01:42:40.949 --> 01:42:42.830]  Now that is statistical evidence.
[01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:43.731]  We can prove that.
[01:42:44.435 --> 01:42:45.555]  Unequivocally.
[01:42:45.555 --> 01:42:54.458]  Now, it doesn't take to be a rocket scientist to divide $190 total into 52 weeks.
[01:42:54.458 --> 01:42:59.279]  That comes out to $3.65 a week.
[01:42:59.279 --> 01:43:04.260]  If it lasts you 12 months, if it lasts you 24 months, half of that.
[01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:05.701]  That's per week.
[01:43:05.701 --> 01:43:11.322]  Compare that to the $20 or more spending in the supermarket for chemicals.
[01:43:11.322 --> 01:43:13.583]  And we offer products that are twice as good
[01:43:14.178 --> 01:43:14.598]  I don't think so.
[01:43:31.603 --> 01:43:43.166]  And the reason we got back on organics was, I've been using Calvin I guess about four years, but we would, you know, wash the baby even with so-called store baby soaps and make him get rashes.
[01:43:43.166 --> 01:43:47.387]  And then once we went and bought more expensive, some of the organics wouldn't do it, some would.
[01:43:47.387 --> 01:43:51.909]  We'd find out even the quote organics had the sulfates and salts and stuff.
[01:43:51.909 --> 01:43:54.929]  Calvin soap with our babies, just absolutely amazing.
[01:43:54.929 --> 01:44:00.411]  I mean, folks, again, Michael Trudeau, who used to be the sales manager at Genesis, I told the story about four years ago.
[01:44:01.201 --> 01:44:03.942]  Mails me a box of this and says, man, you gotta interview this guy.
[01:44:03.942 --> 01:44:04.762]  You gotta have him on.
[01:44:04.762 --> 01:44:06.002]  He's a great sponsor.
[01:44:06.002 --> 01:44:07.842]  And I'm like, yeah, whatever, blah, blah, blah.
[01:44:07.842 --> 01:44:10.023]  And then my wife runs out of the air supply in a year.
[01:44:10.023 --> 01:44:11.683]  What a great gift you gave us, Marty.
[01:44:11.683 --> 01:44:12.243]  I'm so busy.
[01:44:12.243 --> 01:44:14.664]  I'm like, soap, that's for the woman, you know.
[01:44:14.664 --> 01:44:15.804]  I'm the male chauvinist pig.
[01:44:15.804 --> 01:44:17.184]  I'm not involved in all this.
[01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:19.285]  She's like, I want more.
[01:44:19.285 --> 01:44:20.025]  I want this.
[01:44:20.025 --> 01:44:20.945]  What is this?
[01:44:20.945 --> 01:44:23.306]  And I'm like, she goes, and I'm like, yeah, I do like how it smells.
[01:44:23.306 --> 01:44:26.887]  Boy, that bar soap smells so good with that cherry and almond oil in it.
[01:44:26.887 --> 01:44:28.987]  But I mean, it just, here's an example.
[01:44:30.262 --> 01:44:32.144]  Uh, sometimes I run out of Calvin soap.
[01:44:32.144 --> 01:44:33.785]  You know, my wife's got the fancier soap.
[01:44:33.785 --> 01:44:35.306]  She still uses some other stuff.
[01:44:35.306 --> 01:44:36.887]  I'll wash with some soap.
[01:44:36.887 --> 01:44:38.688]  Get a little bit of it under my arms.
[01:44:38.688 --> 01:44:40.569]  Happened to happen yesterday.
[01:44:40.569 --> 01:44:44.551]  And I'm like, man, I gotta get more of my Calvin soap because, you know, other stuff comes into the house.
[01:44:44.551 --> 01:44:46.192]  We don't just use that exclusively.
[01:44:46.192 --> 01:44:48.254]  Women like to buy other stuff at the store.
[01:44:48.254 --> 01:44:50.135]  And, uh, you know, it burned me.
[01:44:50.135 --> 01:44:52.636]  Uh, because I end up taking a quick shower because I'm in such a hurry.
[01:44:52.636 --> 01:44:53.417]  Leave it under my arms.
[01:44:54.176 --> 01:44:55.137]  We make five basic soaps.
[01:44:55.137 --> 01:44:55.677]  Four are pure soaps.
[01:45:20.037 --> 01:45:31.932]  Bath soap, hair soap, dish soap, laundry soap, and a powder that goes in the automatic dishwasher, which is not a soap because you can't use a soap in an automatic dishwasher.
[01:45:31.932 --> 01:45:34.015]  It'll suds you out of the kitchen.
[01:45:34.015 --> 01:45:36.799]  But the four basic soaps will do a hundred jobs.
[01:45:37.259 --> 01:45:45.444]  You don't have to buy all-purpose cleaners, or window cleaners, or floor cleaners, and all the additives, and chemicals, and sprays, and powders, and bars.
[01:45:45.444 --> 01:45:47.004]  Which, by the way, aren't linked.
[01:45:47.004 --> 01:45:51.847]  They've been proven to cause asthma, cancer, skin allergies.
[01:45:51.847 --> 01:45:59.731]  I mean, uh, I remember coming into the office when we have the maid service here, and I had to tell them to cut back on the amount of cleaner, and it would just breathe it and feel sick in it.
[01:45:59.731 --> 01:46:00.852]  It's like a stench.
[01:46:02.682 --> 01:46:04.565]  Perfumes are very harmful.
[01:46:04.565 --> 01:46:06.268]  We don't use perfumes.
[01:46:06.268 --> 01:46:11.077]  We use natural juices of almonds, of lemons, of coconuts.
[01:46:13.214 --> 01:46:17.716]  Well, again, I habitualize.
[01:46:17.716 --> 01:46:22.678]  I get in the habit of using the cheapest cleaning crew we can, because we're too busy around here where the cleaning crew comes once a week.
[01:46:22.678 --> 01:46:23.559]  That's it.
[01:46:23.559 --> 01:46:28.101]  I like the cleaning crew we got, guys, but before I forget, get rid of them, even though it costs twice as much.
[01:46:28.101 --> 01:46:31.082]  Get me an organic crew in here, and I don't want to read the bottles.
[01:46:31.082 --> 01:46:38.966]  See, we're all so busy with life that I come in here and my eyes are burning when they've been here at night to work the extra shift, and then I'm like, oh God, the maids were here.
[01:46:42.768 --> 01:46:44.068]  We've got to think, Marty.
[01:46:44.068 --> 01:46:52.113]  We've got to call you and get off this stuff.
[01:46:52.113 --> 01:46:53.794]  Well, it's no hype.
[01:46:53.794 --> 01:46:54.594]  It's no brag.
[01:46:54.594 --> 01:46:56.875]  Just fact, as John Wayne would say.
[01:46:56.875 --> 01:46:59.016]  Marty, I'm telling you, you've got an amazing product.
[01:47:00.481 --> 01:47:03.885]  You've got a little tote bag that's got a sample of everything at cost.
[01:47:03.885 --> 01:47:05.327]  Tell folks how they get that.
[01:47:05.327 --> 01:47:10.172]  Well, they can get a year's supply and save themselves $1,000 immediately.
[01:47:10.172 --> 01:47:15.078]  Or they can get a starter pack, a one-month supply, which weighs out at six pounds.
[01:47:15.078 --> 01:47:16.980]  We ship it by United Parcel.
[01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:18.783]  We don't trust the post office.
[01:47:18.783 --> 01:47:20.004]  They break too much stuff.
[01:47:20.004 --> 01:47:20.685]  Oh yeah, they're horrible.
[01:47:21.065 --> 01:47:22.846]  United Parcel goes door to door.
[01:47:22.846 --> 01:47:25.969]  They automatically insure it for $20.
[01:47:25.969 --> 01:47:39.138]  You'll get yourself a one to two month supply of bath soap, air soap, dish soap, and laundry soap, a book of instructions, a tiny little measuring scoop, and you're gonna be, uh, it's gonna change your life.
[01:47:39.138 --> 01:47:40.458]  Marty, give him the phone number.
[01:47:40.458 --> 01:47:41.439]  Give him the website.
[01:47:41.439 --> 01:47:44.881]  Website is 5starsoap.com.
[01:47:44.881 --> 01:47:47.884]  5, the number, or the letter, 5starsoap.com.
[01:47:48.664 --> 01:47:50.026]  We're waiting for you on that.
[01:47:50.026 --> 01:47:51.468]  You can call us toll free 1-800-340-7091.
[01:47:51.468 --> 01:47:52.129]  That's 800-340-7091.
[01:48:01.104 --> 01:48:03.266]  Our family is waiting for your call.
[01:48:03.266 --> 01:48:05.067]  We're not a big corporation.
[01:48:05.067 --> 01:48:07.508]  We're a small, family-owned company.
[01:48:07.508 --> 01:48:09.910]  You buy factory direct.
[01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:10.871]  No middleman.
[01:48:10.871 --> 01:48:11.751]  No broker.
[01:48:11.751 --> 01:48:12.812]  No distributor.
[01:48:12.812 --> 01:48:13.753]  No jobber.
[01:48:13.753 --> 01:48:14.813]  No wholesaler.
[01:48:14.813 --> 01:48:17.775]  We eliminate them, so we keep our costs low.
[01:48:31.745 --> 01:48:32.885]  800-340-7091.
[01:48:32.885 --> 01:48:36.889]  Okay, shifting gears.
[01:48:36.889 --> 01:48:39.371]  Give me a limerick.
[01:48:39.371 --> 01:48:41.772]  A limerick packs laughs.
[01:48:41.772 --> 01:48:42.533]  Anatomical.
[01:48:42.533 --> 01:48:45.876]  It's a space that is quite economical.
[01:48:45.876 --> 01:48:50.279]  But the good ones I've seen, so seldom are clean.
[01:48:50.279 --> 01:48:52.621]  And the clean ones, so seldom are comical.
[01:48:55.084 --> 01:48:56.205]  Oh, man.
[01:48:56.205 --> 01:48:57.485]  Marty, thank you for joining us.
[01:48:57.485 --> 01:48:58.326]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:48:58.326 --> 01:49:03.308]  I appreciate your calls, your consumers, your ideas, everything you're doing.
[01:49:03.308 --> 01:49:05.529]  We love you over here at Calvin Soap.
[01:49:05.529 --> 01:49:06.289]  You guys are awesome.
[01:49:06.289 --> 01:49:07.129]  Take care, Marty.
[01:49:07.129 --> 01:49:07.689]  Thank you.
[01:49:07.689 --> 01:49:08.370]  What a character.
[01:49:08.370 --> 01:49:10.151]  They don't make them like that anymore, as they say.
[01:49:10.151 --> 01:49:17.074]  And that one sponsor pays for an entire person here at this office every month, and it's a great product.
[01:49:17.074 --> 01:49:17.854]  Win, win, win, win, win.
[01:49:18.897 --> 01:49:27.663]  I could probably build a castle if I was selling magic machines and magic pyramids and miracle products, but I refuse to do it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:27.663 --> 01:49:33.947]  We just bring you well-known good vitamins, well-known organic soaps, well-known Second Amendment stuff.
[01:49:33.947 --> 01:49:34.848]  Well, I'm dreaming.
[01:49:34.848 --> 01:49:35.908]  I don't have a Second Amendment sponsor.
[01:49:35.908 --> 01:49:36.789]  I wish we did.
[01:49:36.789 --> 01:49:38.530]  We're looking for one.
[01:49:38.530 --> 01:49:41.892]  Survival-type stuff or armament.
[01:49:41.892 --> 01:49:42.533]  Defense.
[01:49:42.533 --> 01:49:47.196]  But the point is, I believe in what I'm doing.
[01:49:49.025 --> 01:49:50.987]  You know, we have sponsors up here and there.
[01:49:50.987 --> 01:49:53.569]  Thanks for putting up with it, because that's what makes it all possible.
[01:49:53.569 --> 01:50:00.355]  We don't have General Electric and General Motors and Toyota and Procter & Gamble advertising here, and I wouldn't take them.
[01:50:00.355 --> 01:50:01.977]  I turn down advertising every day.
[01:50:01.977 --> 01:50:07.361]  What is it about crap that you can always get that and sell that?
[01:50:07.361 --> 01:50:09.884]  But so many times, people don't want what's real.
[01:50:09.884 --> 01:50:11.185]  And let me tell you, that Calvin sub's real.
[01:50:12.057 --> 01:50:12.638]  Okay, here's the deal.
[01:50:12.638 --> 01:50:18.724]  I got a bunch of news I want to blitz through in the next segment, then I got another guest in studio, then another guest in the hour after that.
[01:50:18.724 --> 01:50:29.956]  I cannot over-emphasize how important this Jesse Ventura second interview he did with us is, or the two articles about what he said on Howard Stern today about insurance fraud and the government being behind the attacks.
[01:50:31.138 --> 01:50:36.960]  Now, again, they picked the targets not for insurance fraud, but they went ahead and picked some where they could get insurance and get rid of a problem.
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:38.401]  It's cost-benefit analysis.
[01:50:38.401 --> 01:50:40.322]  It's just why they chose that site.
[01:50:40.322 --> 01:50:45.564]  They attacked it to get our liberties and launch endless wars and turn us into slaves, and they've done a very good job.
[01:50:45.564 --> 01:50:46.344]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:46.344 --> 01:50:48.405]  It's all up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:51.753 --> 01:51:04.882]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:51:04.882 --> 01:51:15.950]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:18.191]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose
[01:51:19.352 --> 01:51:21.113]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:51:21.113 --> 01:51:27.255]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[01:51:27.255 --> 01:51:32.657]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:51:32.657 --> 01:51:42.441]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[01:51:42.881 --> 01:51:45.504]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[01:51:45.504 --> 01:51:50.829]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:51:51.854 --> 01:51:55.636]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[01:51:55.636 --> 01:52:00.337]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[01:52:00.337 --> 01:52:05.639]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[01:52:05.639 --> 01:52:16.864]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[01:52:16.864 --> 01:52:19.225]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[01:52:19.625 --> 01:52:21.667]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[01:52:21.667 --> 01:52:22.587]  Let's face it.
[01:52:22.587 --> 01:52:25.430]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:33.436]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[01:52:33.436 --> 01:52:35.738]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:52:35.738 --> 01:52:38.860]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:42.923]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[01:52:42.923 --> 01:52:45.105]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[01:52:45.105 --> 01:52:47.467]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:52:47.947 --> 01:52:49.568]  And it's safe for all cars.
[01:52:49.568 --> 01:52:51.569]  Act now.
[01:52:51.569 --> 01:52:55.992]  Prepare for an uncertain future with DVDs from the winner of 13 Telly Awards.
[01:52:55.992 --> 01:52:59.434]  Hoods Woods is the world leader in survival instructional videos.
[01:52:59.434 --> 01:53:09.720]  Hoods Woods produces an outstanding collection of survival DVDs from cave cooking to survival basics to home survival DVDs covering topics such as food storage and home emergency planning.
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:13.942]  You will learn survival techniques for use in the wild and in your very own home.
[01:53:13.942 --> 01:53:15.503]  Use BuyScouts, the military.
[01:53:15.503 --> 01:53:16.083]  We're good to go!
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:35.840]  Oh yeah, oh...
[01:54:15.292 --> 01:54:16.673]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:16.673 --> 01:54:22.078]  We've got Randy Kelton, who has been kidnapped by Williamson County Police, you name it.
[01:54:23.041 --> 01:54:24.242]  A very interesting fella.
[01:54:24.242 --> 01:54:27.443]  He went there to file a complaint on him, so they just arrested him right there.
[01:54:27.443 --> 01:54:32.265]  I mean, just insane lawlessness by government.
[01:54:32.265 --> 01:54:37.307]  And he's been successful in filing criminal complaints on individuals.
[01:54:37.307 --> 01:54:41.049]  And I wanted to get his take on what he'd do, say, in Kentucky with the press.
[01:54:41.049 --> 01:54:47.992]  Given press passes, they ask all over North about concentration camps, which they've got Senate hearings on, and the police come and tackle them and steal their equipment.
[01:54:47.992 --> 01:54:50.193]  So we'll get his take on all that.
[01:54:50.193 --> 01:54:51.393]  We'll also have a live video feed.
[01:54:51.393 --> 01:54:52.354]  We're going to be encoding
[01:54:53.214 --> 01:55:07.479]  LivePrisonPlanet.tv viewers will be able to see with Randy Kelton coming up in the next hour and then I'm not going to be on video in the fourth with Karen Johnson because I've already done video with Burmus earlier.
[01:55:07.479 --> 01:55:11.120]  And I'll tell you flat out why.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:15.381]  It's exhausting to be doing video in here and switching back and forth and doing the show and thinking about the news.
[01:55:15.381 --> 01:55:17.382]  So I'm trying to limit it to about two hours of video a day.
[01:55:17.382 --> 01:55:18.682]  I did like three hours yesterday.
[01:55:19.418 --> 01:55:22.000]  I felt like I'd been run over by a Mack truck at the end of it.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:29.184]  There's a whole other dimension to video, and I'm in here switching things and running some things, and I don't claim to be doing a very good job at it either.
[01:55:29.184 --> 01:55:37.249]  Before I start the next hour with Randy Kelton, who we really appreciate his fine work, I wanted to go over some of the news again.
[01:55:37.249 --> 01:55:40.811]  Supply Concern puts oil above $130 a barrel for the first time.
[01:55:40.811 --> 01:55:46.114]  We told you two years ago that they were going to bring it up to $200, according to their own documents and our moles.
[01:55:46.795 --> 01:55:47.676]  And our moles are good.
[01:55:47.676 --> 01:55:49.237]  I mean, they tell us where the Bilderberg meetings are.
[01:55:49.237 --> 01:55:52.259]  They tell us when the Berlin Wall is going to be staged to fall.
[01:55:52.259 --> 01:55:58.244]  They tell us when the subprime is going to be artificially popped, years before it happens.
[01:55:58.244 --> 01:56:00.165]  So this is pretty important info.
[01:56:00.165 --> 01:56:04.749]  To tell you that it's supply worries, make it $130 is total bull.
[01:56:04.749 --> 01:56:09.953]  The dollar is being devalued and oil is denominated, for now, in dollars.
[01:56:11.389 --> 01:56:17.612]  And so that's why you're paying 130, because your dollar's been devalued by 68% from 2000 levels opening with the euro.
[01:56:17.612 --> 01:56:19.453]  That would be 52% at parity with the euro in 2002.
[01:56:26.252 --> 01:56:30.554]  She can cut it in either way you like, 60-plus or 50-plus percent reduction.
[01:56:30.554 --> 01:56:36.376]  That's why you've gone from $40 a barrel five years ago, as they started devaluing the dollar, it follows.
[01:56:36.376 --> 01:56:41.538]  When the dollar drops by a cent, oil goes up a few dollars a barrel.
[01:56:41.538 --> 01:56:44.439]  And if you extrapolate it out, it's an exact calculation for that.
[01:56:46.107 --> 01:56:48.388]  OPEC has actually kept production the same for several years.
[01:56:48.388 --> 01:56:50.089]  They increased it two years ago.
[01:56:50.089 --> 01:56:52.270]  So, I'm not defending OPEC either.
[01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:53.530]  It's all part of the same mechanism.
[01:56:53.530 --> 01:56:56.772]  It's just that's not the part of the mechanism where you're being raped.
[01:56:56.772 --> 01:56:58.653]  But, of course, the establishment misdirects you.
[01:56:58.653 --> 01:57:04.095]  Those raping you and devaluing the dollar with policies they had are the ones doing it.
[01:57:04.095 --> 01:57:05.616]  Kennedy being released from hospital.
[01:57:05.616 --> 01:57:07.657]  They say he has terminal brain cancer.
[01:57:07.657 --> 01:57:12.499]  He's a very wicked man, but I still can't take glee in the fact that he'll be leaving us.
[01:57:13.630 --> 01:57:18.554]  And I'm sure he's got a one-way express ticket to hell.
[01:57:18.554 --> 01:57:20.036]  He has disarmed millions.
[01:57:20.036 --> 01:57:25.961]  He has caused the murder of millions, the rape and assault of millions.
[01:57:25.961 --> 01:57:33.007]  He has been a gun-grabbing, anti-family, CPS-loving pig.
[01:57:33.007 --> 01:57:34.528]  And he'll be going to hell soon, probably.
[01:57:34.528 --> 01:57:37.531]  I'm not trying to judge, but I would guess he's going to hell.
[01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:41.090]  Doesn't matter, his life is hell.
[01:57:41.090 --> 01:57:42.451]  He's a sack of crap.
[01:57:42.451 --> 01:57:45.691]  Excuse me folks, I just, I just, I just can't handle it.
[01:57:45.691 --> 01:57:48.072]  This is the attack on Iran.
[01:57:48.072 --> 01:57:48.772]  Trash the Constitution.
[01:57:48.772 --> 01:57:50.092]  We'll get to that later.
[01:57:50.092 --> 01:57:52.953]  We got some news on Bilderberg out of Jim Tucker yesterday.
[01:57:52.953 --> 01:57:54.113]  Big breaking news.
[01:57:54.113 --> 01:57:57.174]  Now put an article format up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:57.174 --> 01:57:59.675]  We need your help on this getting it out to people.
[01:57:59.675 --> 01:58:01.075]  So everybody knows it's confirmed.
[01:58:01.075 --> 01:58:03.556]  I am going to be there for the full three days.
[01:58:03.556 --> 01:58:05.416]  The 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th.
[01:58:05.416 --> 01:58:06.216]  Starts on the 6th.
[01:58:06.216 --> 01:58:07.597]  I'm going to be there on the 5th.
[01:58:07.597 --> 01:58:08.257]  5th to the 8th.
[01:58:08.257 --> 01:58:09.157]  Officially 6th to the 8th.
[01:58:10.399 --> 01:58:13.460]  And it's at the Westfields Marriott in Chantilly.
[01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:15.480]  So, more on that later.
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:20.581]  We've got a state senator who's saying 9-11 is an inside job who joined us for 20 minutes, 30 minutes a few weeks ago.
[01:58:20.581 --> 01:58:23.342]  I've got her for a full hour to take your calls.
[01:58:23.342 --> 01:58:33.205]  We'll be back in 70 seconds to talk about how to go after the criminals in government that are raping us at their leisure.
[01:58:33.205 --> 01:58:35.825]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:35.825 --> 01:58:38.786]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:41.949 --> 01:58:43.370]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:43.370 --> 01:58:46.171]  A New World Order.
[01:58:46.171 --> 01:58:50.693]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:50.693 --> 01:58:53.894]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:53.894 --> 01:58:56.675]  Put their objective being world domination.
[01:58:56.675 --> 01:58:59.877]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.877 --> 01:59:07.180]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:10.226 --> 01:59:15.652]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:15.652 --> 01:59:18.976]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:18.976 --> 01:59:22.099]  The overbearing is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:22.099 --> 01:59:23.260]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:24.061]  They're not after money.
[01:59:24.061 --> 01:59:25.323]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:25.323 --> 01:59:26.103]  They're after power.
[01:59:26.103 --> 01:59:27.465]  That's what they're after these years.
[01:59:27.465 --> 01:59:31.589]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:59:36.153 --> 01:59:36.913]  In-game.
[01:59:36.913 --> 01:59:38.954]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:59:38.954 --> 01:59:44.177]  You have been warned.
[01:59:44.177 --> 01:59:46.579]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.579 --> 01:59:49.321]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:56.109 --> 01:59:57.851]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:57.851 --> 01:59:59.453]  You want answers?
[01:59:59.453 --> 02:00:00.995]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:00.995 --> 02:00:05.199]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.199 --> 02:00:09.264]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.210 --> 02:00:36.153]  We are now into hour number three, but we've now got a fourth hour coming up because there's so much news and information to cover.
[02:00:36.153 --> 02:00:43.996]  We'll cover a lot of news with Arizona State Senator Karen Johnson coming up in the fourth hour today.
[02:00:43.996 --> 02:00:48.977]  But somebody I've wanted to get in studio for quite a while is a radio talk show host.
[02:00:48.977 --> 02:00:51.478]  He also does presentations.
[02:00:51.478 --> 02:00:55.620]  I guess I'll let him describe what he thinks he is and the work he does.
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:56.260]  There's a lot of
[02:00:57.535 --> 02:01:03.517]  These kind of tinkerers in law and the Constitutional Bill of Rights, and most of them are very unsuccessful.
[02:01:03.517 --> 02:01:16.180]  I've seen them send many people I know, acquaintances to prison, magical straw man theories, UCC theories, imaginary quackery.
[02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:17.460]  So I don't traffic in that.
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:21.481]  Or people setting up trust and then they have you sign your property over to them and they take it.
[02:01:22.350 --> 02:01:32.117]  Some of the folks around 10 years ago used to do that, and so I wouldn't have anything to do with them, and then they'd say I was a government agent, because I wouldn't promote sending my listeners to somebody who'd get them sent to prison.
[02:01:32.117 --> 02:01:37.501]  You know, basic stuff like you saw with the poor freemen, you know, passing all these fake notes around.
[02:01:37.501 --> 02:01:38.942]  I'm not even saying they're bad people.
[02:01:38.942 --> 02:01:40.764]  They just are given a line of bull,
[02:01:41.644 --> 02:01:42.384]  And they run with it.
[02:01:42.384 --> 02:01:46.325]  That's why I have Larry Becraft on and other real lawyers and constitutional scholars.
[02:01:46.325 --> 02:01:48.726]  Because there are, uh, George Gordon's another good one.
[02:01:48.726 --> 02:01:55.068]  He's won the Supreme Court and other state courts, uh, and state Supreme Courts and federal appellate courts.
[02:01:55.068 --> 02:01:59.009]  So I only have on people who I know won't send you directly to jail.
[02:01:59.009 --> 02:02:01.829]  Uh, still fighting the enemy, we'll have them come after you in many cases.
[02:02:01.829 --> 02:02:07.411]  These are criminals who've had their way, that almost always win, who even think being criminal is good.
[02:02:08.564 --> 02:02:11.449]  And so, Randy Kelton, we'll also be talking during the breaks.
[02:02:11.449 --> 02:02:14.894]  If you're listening to InfoWars.com, audio streams, or watching...
[02:02:16.016 --> 02:02:21.540]  On PrisonPlanet.tv, we're kind of overbooked today, and so I want to give him most of the full hour.
[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:24.342]  So we're just going to talk straight through during the three-minute breaks.
[02:02:24.342 --> 02:02:29.006]  So folks, sorry to the MNFMs, this info is too important, but we appreciate you.
[02:02:29.006 --> 02:02:34.650]  Folks will hear that after the break, but for internet listeners and for folks watching PrisonPlanet.tv, this is so important.
[02:02:34.650 --> 02:02:39.134]  It's a public service announcement that we're going to go ahead and go blow through the breaks.
[02:02:39.134 --> 02:02:41.876]  You'll have to go to InfoWars.com to hear those on those streams.
[02:02:42.794 --> 02:02:46.616]  Also, even though you hear this, don't think you can just run out and do this immediately.
[02:02:46.616 --> 02:02:47.836]  Understand it's at your own peril.
[02:02:47.836 --> 02:02:50.458]  This is a lawless, criminal government.
[02:02:50.458 --> 02:02:52.859]  So there is no silver bullet here.
[02:02:52.859 --> 02:02:54.559]  But I want to thank Randy Kelton for coming in.
[02:02:54.559 --> 02:03:09.026]  Randy, take a minute or two to tell folks about yourself, a veteran, how you woke up with the New World Order, some of the things you... I like how you talk about some of the wrong things you did, how you woke up to that, because people can always turn back and become good people like you've done, and then stand up for righteousness.
[02:03:09.026 --> 02:03:11.067]  Thanks for coming in.
[02:03:11.067 --> 02:03:11.507]  You're welcome.
[02:03:12.475 --> 02:03:15.056]  I started this in 1981.
[02:03:15.056 --> 02:03:18.718]  I spent the night in jail for driving with a headlight out.
[02:03:18.718 --> 02:03:20.539]  That did not seem right.
[02:03:20.539 --> 02:03:26.302]  So when I got out of jail, I got out the Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure and I read them.
[02:03:26.302 --> 02:03:32.085]  And then I looked at what they were actually doing and I thought, I must have stepped through the looking glass.
[02:03:32.085 --> 02:03:36.347]  Or there's some major maxim of law that I have missed.
[02:03:36.989 --> 02:03:37.509]  But let's go back.
[02:03:37.509 --> 02:03:40.490]  Let's talk about you, Randy Kelton, the person, you know, about your life.
[02:03:40.490 --> 02:03:41.671]  Regular guy.
[02:03:41.671 --> 02:03:43.212]  Well, I was just a regular guy.
[02:03:43.212 --> 02:03:44.952]  I had my own business.
[02:03:44.952 --> 02:03:47.433]  I'm a combat veteran.
[02:03:47.433 --> 02:03:51.055]  Talk a little bit about your experience there.
[02:03:51.055 --> 02:04:03.260]  Well, my main experience I had there was Uncle Sam gave me the honor and privilege of holding my twin brother's hand in Chulai, South Vietnam, while he died of gangrene.
[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:06.501]  The last intelligible thing he said to me on this earth
[02:04:07.116 --> 02:04:17.562]  Before the gangrene, the pain, and morphine took his mind away, he was looking across the hall at a, uh, VC they were taking care of, and he said, you know, they're gonna win this war.
[02:04:17.562 --> 02:04:19.583]  And I said, well, why would you say that?
[02:04:19.583 --> 02:04:20.824]  They're the good guys.
[02:04:20.824 --> 02:04:22.845]  We should never have been here.
[02:04:22.845 --> 02:04:29.049]  My brother died thinking he was the bad guy, and in my later studies, I found he was right.
[02:04:30.211 --> 02:04:32.393]  They were fighting for their independence.
[02:04:32.393 --> 02:04:33.354]  We were shooting at them.
[02:04:33.354 --> 02:04:34.436]  We shouldn't have been there.
[02:04:34.436 --> 02:04:35.677]  Tell you what, stay there folks.
[02:04:35.677 --> 02:04:36.478]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[02:04:36.478 --> 02:04:39.601]  But Randy, let's continue this discussion during this break.
[02:04:39.601 --> 02:04:42.064]  For all the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, stay with us.
[02:04:48.735 --> 02:04:50.696]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:04:50.696 --> 02:04:54.318]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:04:54.318 --> 02:04:56.640]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:59.801]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:04:59.801 --> 02:05:05.545]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:05:05.545 --> 02:05:09.447]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:05:09.787 --> 02:05:14.990]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[02:05:46.881 --> 02:05:47.622]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:05:49.059 --> 02:05:52.580]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:05:52.580 --> 02:05:57.982]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:05:57.982 --> 02:06:03.144]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.

[02:07:53.811 --> 02:07:57.214]  He's Randy Kelton, the rule of law.
[02:07:57.214 --> 02:07:59.896]  That's what he talks about.
[02:08:24.409 --> 02:08:28.113]  And, uh, we'll, uh, give you one of his websites.
[02:08:28.113 --> 02:08:30.395]  It's jurisprudence.com.
[02:08:30.395 --> 02:08:31.937]  Not jurisprudence, but jurism...
[02:08:33.283 --> 02:08:34.263]  Prudence.com.
[02:08:34.263 --> 02:08:36.644]  J-U-R-I-S-I-M.
[02:08:36.644 --> 02:08:37.544]  Prudence.com.
[02:08:37.544 --> 02:08:41.645]  We'll tell you more about that as we have him with us in the hour.
[02:08:41.645 --> 02:08:59.108]  So, it's the early 1980s, start back there, you get pulled over, then you get taken to jail for a headlight out, and you go back and look at the law and look at what they're supposed to do and look at the code, break that down, then we'll go through the sagas and the things you've witnessed and the people you've gotten fired, the people you've gotten in trouble, because you have had some successes.
[02:08:59.108 --> 02:09:00.609]  Yes, I have.
[02:09:00.609 --> 02:09:01.629]  And I've had some failures.
[02:09:02.623 --> 02:09:12.531]  Uh, the reason I brought that up is so many people go before the courts and they get screwed around and they think there must be some magic thing that I missed.
[02:09:12.531 --> 02:09:15.593]  There's something important I don't know.
[02:09:15.593 --> 02:09:17.054]  Well, there's not.
[02:09:17.054 --> 02:09:19.256]  These guys are just criminals.
[02:09:19.256 --> 02:09:23.999]  They're just doing whatever they want to do because they believe they can.
[02:09:23.999 --> 02:09:28.303]  I kicked this dog for some 25 years.
[02:09:28.303 --> 02:09:31.165]  Three dislocated ribs, two broken collarbones, and broken elbow.
[02:09:32.586 --> 02:09:36.949]  I never brought this to anyone else because I hadn't found a way to do it safely.
[02:09:36.949 --> 02:09:38.510]  Well, let's go through all the things that happened.
[02:09:38.510 --> 02:09:41.231]  I mean, let's go back to the cop arrest you for no headlight.
[02:09:41.231 --> 02:09:41.892]  How did that happen?
[02:09:41.892 --> 02:09:44.073]  And then go through all the things you've been through.
[02:09:44.073 --> 02:09:47.795]  He was in a bad mood and he asked me for my proof of insurance.
[02:09:47.795 --> 02:09:54.480]  And I said, well, if I show you my proof of insurance and you look at it and see that it expired yesterday, what will you do?
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:55.961]  He said, I'll arrest you.
[02:09:55.961 --> 02:09:58.682]  In that case, I'm not going to show it to you.
[02:09:58.682 --> 02:09:59.763]  Well, he arrested me anyway.
[02:10:00.888 --> 02:10:02.629]  But that was really a minor thing.
[02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:04.650]  It just opened the door.
[02:10:04.650 --> 02:10:08.612]  After that, I had a sheriff's deputy try to kill me once in front of my house.
[02:10:08.612 --> 02:10:10.573]  What happened with that?
[02:10:10.573 --> 02:10:11.353]  We went to court.
[02:10:11.353 --> 02:10:13.154]  I beat him in court.
[02:10:13.154 --> 02:10:16.976]  But the deputies made up a story that never happened.
[02:10:16.976 --> 02:10:18.336]  And there was a street full of witnesses.
[02:10:18.336 --> 02:10:20.097]  And that shocks you when they lie!
[02:10:20.097 --> 02:10:22.738]  I've had them do it to me, and it's like, you're a criminal!
[02:10:22.738 --> 02:10:24.639]  And they just smile and go, yeah, I am.
[02:10:24.639 --> 02:10:26.380]  We had a whole street full of witnesses.
[02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:30.162]  I'm thinking, how can they imagine they can get this past the courts?
[02:10:30.162 --> 02:10:30.562]  They could.
[02:10:31.161 --> 02:10:35.043]  The courts was not interested in anything anyone had to say.
[02:10:35.043 --> 02:10:39.224]  They were intent on prosecuting me no matter what.
[02:10:39.224 --> 02:10:43.286]  But the jury was not quite so intent.
[02:10:43.286 --> 02:10:54.030]  My daughter worked for a woman whose husband was on the jury and she said they were irate when they found out what was actually going on.
[02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:55.531]  So I beat them there.
[02:10:56.497 --> 02:10:59.960]  But I was in the process of trying to fix the system.
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:03.342]  I felt like I owed this to my brother.
[02:11:03.342 --> 02:11:09.727]  That I should lay down and roll over for these scum after what he paid for.
[02:11:09.727 --> 02:11:11.589]  So the fight was on.
[02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:18.054]  And I didn't... I just appeared recently on the scene because I wouldn't ask someone to take the kind of risks I was taking.
[02:11:18.054 --> 02:11:22.337]  So you've been doing this for two decades plus and you've now developed some things you think work.
[02:11:22.337 --> 02:11:26.200]  Yes, when I came across actually filing criminal charges against them.
[02:11:27.150 --> 02:11:31.993]  And going after grand juries, everything changed.
[02:11:31.993 --> 02:11:33.815]  Folks, there is an answer out there.
[02:11:33.815 --> 02:11:37.477]  Well, we're going to talk about it, but let's go back to how you got bones broken.
[02:11:37.477 --> 02:11:40.880]  Well, I had a sheriff deputy grab me.
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:44.402]  He was just one of these policemen who shouldn't have been a policeman.
[02:11:44.402 --> 02:11:45.443]  That's a power trip, yeah.
[02:11:45.443 --> 02:11:52.968]  Yeah, he had stopped my son in front of my house a day after I filed suit against the sheriff over an open records issue.
[02:11:52.968 --> 02:11:54.089]  It was just a technical suit.
[02:11:55.294 --> 02:12:02.078]  And the next day I looked out my front door and I saw this policeman out there throw something down, kick it up in the air.
[02:12:02.078 --> 02:12:03.499]  And I thought that looked odd.
[02:12:03.499 --> 02:12:04.300]  I stepped outside.
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:06.922]  He had my son pulled over in front of my house.
[02:12:06.922 --> 02:12:11.144]  And when I went to find out what was going on, he tried to kill me.
[02:12:11.144 --> 02:12:15.507]  And people claim that the sheriff sent him to do it, but I don't think so.
[02:12:15.507 --> 02:12:17.268]  The guy was just crazy.
[02:12:17.268 --> 02:12:24.673]  Well, I've seen cases where the guy's got a sign saying our judicial system's a joke outside the judge's jurisdiction, and he has cops go arrest him for saying that.
[02:12:25.299 --> 02:12:26.281]  I mean, they're just, they're crazy.
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:38.121]  I don't even mess with policemen anymore.
[02:12:38.121 --> 02:12:39.903]  Well, I want to talk about all that, and we're going to.
[02:12:39.903 --> 02:12:41.004]  We'll have you back again, Randy.
[02:12:41.004 --> 02:12:47.549]  But right now, I want people to get the backside of this, kind of the war stories, I mean, abbreviated, the saga.
[02:12:47.549 --> 02:12:51.512]  Some of the things you've seen, like a few months ago in Williamson County, you went to file a complaint.
[02:12:51.512 --> 02:12:52.112]  What happened there?
[02:12:52.112 --> 02:12:55.275]  I mean, I don't think citizens, until it happens to them, then they're isolated.
[02:12:55.275 --> 02:12:56.396]  Nobody cares.
[02:12:56.396 --> 02:12:59.898]  Realize what it's like till they're there framing you.
[02:12:59.898 --> 02:13:00.779]  Yes.
[02:13:00.779 --> 02:13:04.242]  For me, it was difficult, and I absolutely knew
[02:13:05.014 --> 02:13:14.462]  That I'm gonna kick you guys behinds every way from Sunday, but it was still difficult standing on that cold concrete floor for 29 hours.
[02:13:14.462 --> 02:13:17.285]  But this happens to everybody.
[02:13:17.285 --> 02:13:18.345]  I've had a number of things.
[02:13:18.345 --> 02:13:19.206]  My elbow got broke.
[02:13:19.206 --> 02:13:31.837]  It was kind of my fault because I told a bailiff when I was trying to file criminal charges with the grand jury against the district attorney, and he demanded to know what my purpose was in the building today and
[02:13:33.058 --> 02:13:36.700]  I had already asked him for the grand jury, so he knew.
[02:13:36.700 --> 02:13:41.362]  So I told him, well, I have business here today, and it's none of yours.
[02:13:41.362 --> 02:13:46.804]  He said, well, I'm the court security officer and the bailiff and court bailiff, and I want to know what your business is.
[02:13:46.804 --> 02:13:51.666]  I said, well, if you're the court bailiff, then right there at the courtroom, just scoot on in there and be a good little bailiff.
[02:13:51.666 --> 02:13:53.467]  You're dismissed.
[02:13:53.467 --> 02:13:55.248]  Well, he didn't take that well.
[02:13:55.248 --> 02:13:56.668]  You don't talk to a god like that.
[02:13:56.668 --> 02:13:58.769]  They talk to us, the slaves, like that.
[02:13:58.769 --> 02:14:00.110]  Not the other way around.
[02:14:00.110 --> 02:14:02.331]  They drug me down the stairs and pushed me out the door.
[02:14:03.436 --> 02:14:06.439]  But to his credit, he didn't intend to break my elbow.
[02:14:06.439 --> 02:14:07.299]  Oh, how nice of him.
[02:14:07.299 --> 02:14:08.701]  Okay.
[02:14:08.701 --> 02:14:21.812]  As I stepped out the door, my foot stepped down on a throw rug, a carpet there, and he was pushing me so it gave me a little forward movement and scooted that carpet out from under me and I fell and broke my elbow.
[02:14:21.812 --> 02:14:25.375]  But I didn't charge him with that.
[02:14:25.375 --> 02:14:28.478]  I've been real careful in what I do.
[02:14:28.478 --> 02:14:30.980]  If they can get you into a fight with them,
[02:14:31.798 --> 02:14:33.999]  They will win every time.
[02:14:33.999 --> 02:14:37.720]  Well, that's why they'll come up and yell and scream at you while you're calm and say, why are you so upset?
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:38.240]  Yeah.
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:44.562]  And if they get too excited with me, I like to take out my cell phone, dial 911.
[02:14:44.562 --> 02:14:45.542]  I got this policeman here.
[02:14:45.542 --> 02:14:47.282]  I think he's going crazy.
[02:14:47.282 --> 02:14:49.163]  He's got slobber dripping out of his mouth.
[02:14:49.163 --> 02:14:50.223]  His eyes are bugging out.
[02:14:50.223 --> 02:14:51.884]  I think he's going to have a heart attack.
[02:14:51.884 --> 02:14:55.365]  You need to get somebody out here before he shoots me.
[02:14:55.365 --> 02:14:57.005]  This always slows him down.
[02:14:57.850 --> 02:14:59.771]  Because they wind up with another policeman out there.
[02:14:59.771 --> 02:15:01.253]  And you call that the chicken dance?
[02:15:01.253 --> 02:15:11.620]  Yeah, they start doing this little chicken dance where the one I call and I'm asking him to arrest his buddy and he's got my call on 911 and that's not going to go away.
[02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:19.867]  He don't want to arrest his buddy and I keep insisting and with him I get real obnoxious.
[02:15:19.867 --> 02:15:25.491]  And he starts scooting back and forth from one foot to another and I call that their little chicken dance.
[02:15:26.494 --> 02:15:35.781]  When you become the sovereign and invoke the same law that they use against you, it changes everything.
[02:15:35.781 --> 02:15:39.605]  So, I've been doing this quite a while and it took some time.
[02:15:39.605 --> 02:15:43.528]  It took some learning of things you can do and things you can't do.
[02:15:43.528 --> 02:15:45.169]  Stay away from the sheriff.
[02:15:45.169 --> 02:15:47.271]  Stay away from the police department.
[02:15:47.271 --> 02:15:49.913]  All that'll do is get you beat up.
[02:15:49.913 --> 02:15:53.956]  Well, I was thrown out of the sheriff's department one day by the chief deputy.
[02:15:54.670 --> 02:16:05.017]  When I was starting to file criminal complaints and I stood in front of the place and looked around and thought, I bet if I try to leave this county, somebody's going to be waiting for me.
[02:16:05.017 --> 02:16:12.622]  So I went to the county judge and asked him to call the sheriff's department, see if they had a warrant for me, ask him to call the chief deputy.
[02:16:12.622 --> 02:16:14.023]  And he did.
[02:16:14.023 --> 02:16:16.725]  The county judge won't know why I want him to do that.
[02:16:16.725 --> 02:16:18.946]  I said, well, I got a bad feeling.
[02:16:18.946 --> 02:16:21.628]  He's going to be sitting out there on the highway waiting for me.
[02:16:21.628 --> 02:16:22.889]  Oh, he wouldn't do a thing like that.
[02:16:23.746 --> 02:16:25.967]  I don't know, but if he did, it'd be bad news.
[02:16:25.967 --> 02:16:29.428]  He called the Sheriff's Department, asked for Doug.
[02:16:29.428 --> 02:16:30.428]  Well, Doug's not here.
[02:16:30.428 --> 02:16:33.069]  He's out in his cruiser.
[02:16:33.069 --> 02:16:39.890]  The judge looked at me and kind of gave me a halfway smile and said, well, have Doug call me.
[02:16:39.890 --> 02:16:49.593]  Doug called him and he said, I have Randy Kelton in my office and he's concerned that someone may be out waiting on the highway for him to go home.
[02:16:50.583 --> 02:16:52.525]  Where are you, Mr. Whitehead?
[02:16:52.525 --> 02:16:55.327]  Oh, well, I'm just making some rounds in my cruiser.
[02:16:55.327 --> 02:16:57.889]  Since when does the Chief Deputy make rounds?
[02:16:57.889 --> 02:17:00.271]  Well, I had business to take care of.
[02:17:00.271 --> 02:17:03.733]  Well, Mr. Whitehead, I hope your business is back at the Sheriff's Department.
[02:17:03.733 --> 02:17:05.455]  No, no, that's not even paranoia.
[02:17:05.455 --> 02:17:07.636]  Tell folks what just happened to you in Williamson County.
[02:17:07.636 --> 02:17:09.238]  Why you were there, what happened?
[02:17:09.238 --> 02:17:16.263]  Well, I went to Williamson County because everyone told me that Williamson County is the most corrupt in the nation.
[02:17:17.245 --> 02:17:18.406]  Or in the state.
[02:17:18.406 --> 02:17:23.389]  I do seminars all over the country, and everybody says, my county's the most corrupt in the state.
[02:17:23.389 --> 02:17:24.951]  Except here.
[02:17:24.951 --> 02:17:28.813]  Here, everybody says, Williamson County's the most corrupt.
[02:17:28.813 --> 02:17:35.378]  And something I know about, the more corrupt they are, the more vulnerable they are.
[02:17:35.378 --> 02:17:39.601]  Most policemen don't get into the police work to be jack-booted thugs.
[02:17:39.601 --> 02:17:42.163]  But they get stuck in this corrupt system.
[02:17:42.163 --> 02:17:43.464]  They know it's corrupt.
[02:17:43.464 --> 02:17:44.444]  They don't like it.
[02:17:44.444 --> 02:17:46.686]  But if they're gonna keep their job, they're gonna follow along.
[02:17:47.324 --> 02:17:51.308]  And then somebody comes along and points their finger right at it.
[02:17:51.308 --> 02:17:53.349]  Well, they knew they were corrupt all the time.
[02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:56.552]  The more corrupt they are, the more concerned they are.
[02:17:56.552 --> 02:18:04.379]  And the first thing they're going to do is creak open their little closet door and look at their darkest skeleton and figure out how I'm going to find it.
[02:18:04.379 --> 02:18:06.541]  So that's why I went to Williamson County.
[02:18:06.541 --> 02:18:10.304]  I filed a criminal charge with the district attorney against the sheriff's deputy.
[02:18:11.812 --> 02:18:14.995]  And that was with what had happened?
[02:18:14.995 --> 02:18:22.180]  A deputy had arrested a woman in Travis County, sitting in a parking lot, with her lights on.
[02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:24.482]  He saw a headlight out.
[02:18:24.482 --> 02:18:27.825]  He pulled into Travis County.
[02:18:27.825 --> 02:18:28.986]  It was in front of a beer joint.
[02:18:28.986 --> 02:18:32.609]  He did a sobriety test on her.
[02:18:32.609 --> 02:18:36.812]  Ran her license and found that ten years earlier she'd had three DUIs.
[02:18:36.812 --> 02:18:39.194]  It had been ten years, you know, when she was in her
[02:18:39.961 --> 02:18:43.423]  Late teens, and it's pretty wild, she got over that.
[02:18:43.423 --> 02:18:46.344]  So he arrested her, took her back to Williamson County.
[02:18:46.344 --> 02:18:51.467]  It had been almost a year, her trying to get it to trial.
[02:18:51.467 --> 02:19:00.372]  So, they told me about it, and, uh, first thing I did was file criminal charges against the officer for false arrest.
[02:19:00.372 --> 02:19:02.833]  Hey, you're not supposed to be out of your jurisdiction.
[02:19:02.833 --> 02:19:09.016]  Technically, he can go 400 yards out of his jurisdiction, but not for a misdemeanor, only for a felony.
[02:19:09.952 --> 02:19:14.997]  And he claimed that he followed her from Williamson County into Travis County.
[02:19:14.997 --> 02:19:17.019]  So, he lied.
[02:19:17.019 --> 02:19:18.620]  We had conflicting opinions.
[02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:20.101]  I wanted a grand jury to sort it out.
[02:19:20.101 --> 02:19:27.668]  Actually, I wanted the district attorney to refuse to take the complaint so I could try to get him arrested.
[02:19:27.668 --> 02:19:30.551]  I always want to go for the highest guy in the district.
[02:19:30.551 --> 02:19:31.732]  Don't want to mess with the policemen.
[02:19:33.534 --> 02:19:35.435]  Stay there.
[02:19:35.435 --> 02:19:42.620]  We're going to get into how to do this when we get back, and we'll talk about some other issues behind the scenes at Infowars.com if you're listening there.
[02:19:42.620 --> 02:19:43.381]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:19:43.381 --> 02:19:43.801]  Stay with me.
[02:19:49.167 --> 02:19:52.029]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:19:52.029 --> 02:19:53.590]  Loose Change Final Cut.

[02:19:59.133 --> 02:20:00.894]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:20:48.381 --> 02:20:49.161]  Gold.
[02:20:49.161 --> 02:20:50.403]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:20:50.683 --> 02:20:56.969]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:20:56.969 --> 02:21:01.153]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:21:01.153 --> 02:21:03.075]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:21:03.075 --> 02:21:05.517]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:21:05.517 --> 02:21:13.204]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[02:22:28.541 --> 02:22:29.762]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[02:22:29.762 --> 02:22:36.585]  I've been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[02:22:57.714 --> 02:23:03.316]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with us.
[02:23:03.316 --> 02:23:10.238]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[02:23:10.238 --> 02:23:16.860]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter, and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[02:23:17.662 --> 02:23:19.222]  Remember our trade deficit?
[02:23:19.222 --> 02:23:25.084]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[02:23:25.084 --> 02:23:31.486]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[02:23:31.486 --> 02:23:32.947]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.
[02:23:32.947 --> 02:23:33.027]  1-800-453-2202.

[02:23:54.519 --> 02:23:57.921]  I was talking to Randy Kelton in behind the scenes of Prison Planet TV viewers.
[02:23:57.921 --> 02:24:08.247]  He was just telling me about one case in Texas where they pull a young guy over, claim he's drinking, and he was in jail five months without a charge, without a name, without a hearing.
[02:24:08.247 --> 02:24:10.488]  And I hear about this all the time, see it in the news now.
[02:24:11.212 --> 02:24:17.755]  Where they just grab you and throw you in jail, and you had to go file criminal charges, habeas corpus documents, all of this.
[02:24:17.755 --> 02:24:20.436]  This isn't just Abu Ghraib people getting flown to Camp X-Ray.
[02:24:20.436 --> 02:24:21.316]  I mean, U.S.
[02:24:21.316 --> 02:24:24.517]  citizens now, it's not even a contempt charge.
[02:24:24.517 --> 02:24:27.879]  They just say, we just put you in jail now.
[02:24:27.879 --> 02:24:30.880]  I mean, that is the opposite of what our country's based on.
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:32.621]  Exactly.
[02:24:32.621 --> 02:24:38.543]  The document I filed, the writ of habeas corpus, it stipulates how
[02:24:39.506 --> 02:24:50.054]  Every step from arrest to trial as presently practiced in Texas is not only wrong, it is very specifically against particular law.
[02:24:50.054 --> 02:24:55.338]  And to be clear though, you've been practicing and exposing things in Texas, but you've looked at it all over the country is the same.
[02:24:55.338 --> 02:25:01.623]  Everywhere I go, this writ of habeas corpus is written on Texas law, but it's based on federal law.
[02:25:01.623 --> 02:25:03.524]  It's essentially the same everywhere.
[02:25:03.524 --> 02:25:05.426]  Everywhere I go, people read it.
[02:25:05.959 --> 02:25:08.140]  They say the same things going on here.
[02:25:08.140 --> 02:25:12.361]  And everywhere I go, everybody says, my county is the most corrupt.
[02:25:12.361 --> 02:25:13.862]  Well, here's an example.
[02:25:13.862 --> 02:25:20.024]  I got arrested protesting, and then they come to the door, and then they just took me away, because you don't have free speech in Austin.
[02:25:20.024 --> 02:25:25.445]  They pay $100,000 and $500,000 lawsuits every few weeks for arresting people at demonstrations.
[02:25:25.445 --> 02:25:27.326]  They just take our tax money and pay it.
[02:25:27.326 --> 02:25:28.326]  They don't care.
[02:25:28.326 --> 02:25:33.648]  They're still gonna keep, they gotta stop that freedom, gotta stop that free speech, or the public might wake up and take them all to prison.
[02:25:34.662 --> 02:25:39.884]  But they came to my jail cell and they said, we want you to sign this, and had all this big list of crimes I've committed to get out.
[02:25:39.884 --> 02:25:42.706]  I said, well, this is a plea of guilt.
[02:25:42.706 --> 02:25:46.247]  And then years later, Mike Hanson got arrested and he told me this, and I went and got the copy.
[02:25:46.247 --> 02:25:47.208]  They even gave it to me.
[02:25:47.208 --> 02:25:52.050]  They don't even... I mean, the Soviets would torture you underground and show you a document and say, sign it.
[02:25:52.050 --> 02:25:54.791]  Here in America, they just say, the average idiot doesn't know.
[02:25:54.791 --> 02:26:01.234]  They go, here, sign your personal recognizance bond, and you're agreeing that you've committed drug dealing, drunken driving.
[02:26:01.234 --> 02:26:03.555]  You're agreeing to all these classes that you've committed a crime.
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:06.462]  Yeah, that's common practice.
[02:26:06.462 --> 02:26:12.007]  I mean, the government's just totally lawless, and do the cops know, and do the jailers know they're criminals?
[02:26:12.007 --> 02:26:12.548]  Yes.
[02:26:12.548 --> 02:26:13.088]  Oh, they do?
[02:26:13.088 --> 02:26:15.891]  And for the most part, they don't like it.
[02:26:15.891 --> 02:26:17.913]  It's not as bad as we think.
[02:26:17.913 --> 02:26:20.215]  There is a remedy out there.
[02:26:20.215 --> 02:26:22.397]  And while I don't blame the policemen,
[02:26:23.078 --> 02:26:36.782]  The remedy involves kicking him right square in his behind as hard as you can so he has plausible deniability to go to his boss and say, if you want to arrest this guy and take him to jail, you do it.
[02:26:36.782 --> 02:26:39.743]  I'm not having him take my bass boat.
[02:26:39.743 --> 02:26:42.084]  You accuse the individual of a crime.
[02:26:42.084 --> 02:26:43.804]  Forget the guys at the top.
[02:26:43.804 --> 02:26:48.085]  Take that personal individual, accuse him of committing a criminal act.
[02:26:48.085 --> 02:26:50.566]  When he commits a criminal act, he loses his immunity.
[02:26:51.161 --> 02:26:52.541]  You can sue him personally.
[02:26:52.541 --> 02:26:53.582]  I know, yeah.
[02:26:53.582 --> 02:26:55.642]  Now you put him under threat.
[02:26:55.642 --> 02:27:02.344]  When I file against every jailer in the jail in Williamson County for following policy, they're going to say, what?
[02:27:02.344 --> 02:27:03.825]  What did I do?
[02:27:03.825 --> 02:27:06.725]  And I'm going to say, you touched the tar baby, Bubba.
[02:27:06.725 --> 02:27:10.226]  Now, I want to get into, first off, you've had quite a few victories now.
[02:27:10.226 --> 02:27:13.407]  And then in the 30 minutes we've got left, let's get into what you do.
[02:27:13.407 --> 02:27:14.387]  And I'd like to have you back, Randy.
[02:27:14.387 --> 02:27:17.928]  You're really a great guy, and we appreciate you coming in.
[02:27:17.928 --> 02:27:19.049]  You've had some victories.
[02:27:19.049 --> 02:27:19.689]  Yes, I have.
[02:27:20.636 --> 02:27:27.198]  Uh, the writ we spoke of earlier, the one I filed in Danny Shull's behalf, I filed it with a local district judge.
[02:27:27.198 --> 02:27:33.719]  They stopped a murder trial to hear it, and the judge threw me out of the courtroom because I wasn't an attorney.
[02:27:33.719 --> 02:27:43.141]  So I prepared criminal charges against the judge and then filed the writ with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, highest court in Texas.
[02:27:43.141 --> 02:27:47.883]  They insisted that I file a motion for leave to file.
[02:27:47.883 --> 02:27:49.883]  Then they denied me leave to file.
[02:27:51.044 --> 02:27:56.406]  Well, writ of habeas corpus is the only court filing mentioned in Constitution.
[02:27:56.406 --> 02:27:59.267]  It's a writ of right.
[02:27:59.267 --> 02:28:00.187]  The great writ?
[02:28:00.187 --> 02:28:01.968]  The great writ.
[02:28:01.968 --> 02:28:06.450]  They denied me permission to exercise a constitutional right.
[02:28:06.450 --> 02:28:10.611]  I see that as official oppression, a class A misdemeanor in Texas.
[02:28:10.611 --> 02:28:17.794]  I went down to the bailiff of the grand jury and I told the bailiff, instruct the foreman I have business with the grand jury.
[02:28:17.794 --> 02:28:20.415]  Instead of instructing the foreman, she called the district attorney.
[02:28:21.078 --> 02:28:28.480]  Who came down and insisted that this was the Grand Jury's last day, and their calendar's full, they just will not have time to hear your complaint.
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:31.281]  But if you'll give it to me, I'll give it to the next Grand Jury.
[02:28:31.281 --> 02:28:39.543]  And I told her, make sure you do, because if you don't, you'll start a fight with me and you that I don't want to have.
[02:28:39.543 --> 02:28:41.864]  She did not give it to the Grand Jury.
[02:28:41.864 --> 02:28:48.586]  So I came back to the Grand Jury with, and told the bailiff, instruct the foreman I have business with the Grand Jury.
[02:28:49.580 --> 02:28:54.664]  Instead, she called the district attorney and handed me the phone and said, this is the district attorney.
[02:28:54.664 --> 02:28:55.925]  She wants to talk to you.
[02:28:55.925 --> 02:29:00.188]  I said, if you look at those complaints, you'll find their complaints against the district attorney.
[02:29:00.188 --> 02:29:01.009]  She's a criminal.
[02:29:01.009 --> 02:29:02.690]  I don't talk to criminals.
[02:29:02.690 --> 02:29:08.495]  And the bailiff took the phone back and, uh, we've got this on, on video.
[02:29:08.495 --> 02:29:12.658]  Uh, he said he can't talk to you because you're the criminal and he don't talk to criminals.
[02:29:14.011 --> 02:29:20.035]  She came out anyway and stopped me from filing criminal complaints against herself with the grand jury.
[02:29:20.035 --> 02:29:24.479]  And now that is a conflict of interest, obstruction of justice, and a bunch of other things.
[02:29:24.479 --> 02:29:25.700]  That is so horrendous.
[02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:26.960]  What else is it?
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:33.665]  It's official oppression, it's shielding from prosecution, and she brought someone with a pistol.
[02:29:33.665 --> 02:29:35.186]  Aggravated assault.
[02:29:35.186 --> 02:29:37.748]  Oh my god, these people are absolutely out of their minds.
[02:29:37.748 --> 02:29:39.349]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:39.349 --> 02:29:40.730]  We're on the march.
[02:29:40.730 --> 02:29:42.232]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:43.254 --> 02:29:48.758]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:48.758 --> 02:29:54.101]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[02:29:54.101 --> 02:29:58.985]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[02:29:58.985 --> 02:30:06.970]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[02:30:07.290 --> 02:30:16.293]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[02:30:49.206 --> 02:30:50.606]  It is a big idea.
[02:30:50.606 --> 02:30:53.447]  A new world order.
[02:30:53.447 --> 02:30:58.329]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:30:58.329 --> 02:31:01.170]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:31:01.170 --> 02:31:03.311]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[02:31:03.953 --> 02:31:07.138]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:31:07.138 --> 02:31:14.448]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:31:17.475 --> 02:31:22.919]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:31:22.919 --> 02:31:26.841]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.

[02:31:48.156 --> 02:31:49.438]  Why should we fire Congress?
[02:31:49.438 --> 02:31:53.063]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[02:31:53.063 --> 02:31:55.386]  They swear an oath to follow it, and then they reject it.
[02:31:55.386 --> 02:31:58.190]  That was their employment document.
[02:31:58.190 --> 02:31:59.252]  They haven't followed it.
[02:31:59.252 --> 02:32:01.134]  Congressmen, Senators, you're fired.
[02:32:01.134 --> 02:32:02.857]  Washington, you're fired!
[02:32:03.097 --> 02:32:04.558]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[02:32:25.498 --> 02:32:25.979]  We're good to go.
[02:33:02.488 --> 02:33:04.189]  Randy Kelton's our guest.
[02:33:04.189 --> 02:33:05.930]  He's had a lot of effect in the courts.
[02:33:05.930 --> 02:33:10.212]  I've seen him have some victories, get some people out of things they hadn't done.
[02:33:10.212 --> 02:33:14.714]  When lawyers wanted $20,000, he was able, with basic procedures, to have them just drop the cases.
[02:33:16.315 --> 02:33:19.436]  I mean, it's one big, giant, corrupt system.
[02:33:19.436 --> 02:33:27.057]  And Randy, we were talking during the last break there for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we were just now getting into the procedures.
[02:33:27.057 --> 02:33:43.401]  The police officer in the old days took you before a judge first, and it was always over rustling, or horse thieving, or rape, or something serious, but they still had to bring you before a judge, before the jail, or they could hold you maybe for a day before you went before a judge when the judge came in, if it was on the weekend or at night.
[02:33:44.068 --> 02:33:47.552]  And now they'll just take it for weeks, months in jail without even charges.
[02:33:47.552 --> 02:33:48.433]  That is kidnapping.
[02:33:48.433 --> 02:33:49.454]  That is official oppression.
[02:33:49.454 --> 02:33:51.116]  That is grade A tyranny.
[02:33:51.116 --> 02:33:53.659]  But all of this has just been standardized.
[02:33:53.659 --> 02:33:56.822]  But here's another example.
[02:33:56.822 --> 02:33:58.183]  Somebody steals your car.
[02:33:58.183 --> 02:33:59.445]  They won't come out and look into it.
[02:33:59.445 --> 02:34:02.008]  If you want to go file a report, they won't even let you.
[02:34:02.008 --> 02:34:04.951]  If you want to file charges on somebody who's knocked your teeth out,
[02:34:05.772 --> 02:34:10.436]  They'll just act like, well, come back later, or I can't do that, or go here.
[02:34:10.436 --> 02:34:18.863]  They don't let you know that they have to file that, and then if you turn out to be a liar, you get arrested for filing false charges.
[02:34:18.863 --> 02:34:20.584]  And so, it's the same thing with grand juries.
[02:34:20.584 --> 02:34:22.566]  Grand juries used to be creatures of the people.
[02:34:22.566 --> 02:34:24.347]  They were open, they were discussed.
[02:34:24.347 --> 02:34:26.109]  Now they've become creatures of the prosecutors.
[02:34:26.109 --> 02:34:28.671]  Everything has been domesticated.
[02:34:28.671 --> 02:34:29.731]  So let's talk about that.
[02:34:33.524 --> 02:34:42.997]  You know, I've gone down many years ago, 10, 12 years ago, when I had stalkers and people breaking my car and doing stuff, being in my backyard, and I'd go to them and they'd say, look, you don't like us cops.
[02:34:42.997 --> 02:34:45.761]  I'm not going to file a thing on him for you.
[02:34:45.761 --> 02:34:46.663]  Just get out of my office.
[02:34:47.378 --> 02:34:48.739]  And I was just like, whoa!
[02:34:48.739 --> 02:34:50.221]  And that was down here in Austin.
[02:34:50.221 --> 02:34:51.622]  And that's when I really started waking up.
[02:34:51.622 --> 02:35:01.250]  I mean, I'd grown up in Dallas, where our sheriff was the jail for being a drug dealer, and I'd seen all kinds of crazy stuff and knew it was all a joke, but I mean, this really is, these are hardcore crooks.
[02:35:01.250 --> 02:35:04.573]  I mean, you're saying your normal officer isn't like that on the ground.
[02:35:04.573 --> 02:35:12.800]  I know they're just out writing tickets and raising revenue and helping people, occasionally, but higher up, I mean, it does seem to get more rotten as you get higher up the fish.
[02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:17.844]  You know, you know, it rots from the head down, but I mean, Randy, that's a lot I've said, but comments on that.
[02:35:17.844 --> 02:35:20.486]  It goes to the law of crudulence.
[02:35:20.486 --> 02:35:23.008]  Crud sinks to the top.
[02:35:23.008 --> 02:35:26.231]  You have to be a scoundrel to ever get there.
[02:35:26.231 --> 02:35:30.994]  And I'm not saying all police are lily white angels.
[02:35:30.994 --> 02:35:37.480]  There are a number of police out there who got into police work for reasons that should have kept them out of police work.
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:41.343]  But for the most part, they got into police work wanting to be a good guy.
[02:35:41.343 --> 02:35:42.764]  They found themselves trapped in this
[02:35:43.778 --> 02:35:46.220]  But then he gets promoted!
[02:36:03.317 --> 02:36:04.297]  He's the one that gets promoted.
[02:36:04.297 --> 02:36:04.698]  The bad guy?
[02:36:04.698 --> 02:36:11.541]  I mean, I've literally seen them pull people who are quadriplegics out and beat them up because they couldn't get out of the car fast enough.
[02:36:11.541 --> 02:36:13.302]  And then that guy gets promoted.
[02:36:13.302 --> 02:36:14.162]  Exactly.
[02:36:14.162 --> 02:36:16.143]  There is a technique.
[02:36:16.143 --> 02:36:20.265]  And mostly, it's getting away from the guy at the bottom.
[02:36:20.265 --> 02:36:26.288]  If a guy at the bottom gives me a problem, or if I have a complaint to file, I never file it with the police.
[02:36:26.288 --> 02:36:28.409]  I go file it with a judge.
[02:36:28.409 --> 02:36:31.470]  And if the judge refuses to take it, wonderful.
[02:36:32.481 --> 02:36:38.284]  Now I get to go to the district attorney and file criminal charges against the judge.
[02:36:38.284 --> 02:36:41.326]  And the district attorney is not even going to take that.
[02:36:41.326 --> 02:36:45.248]  Now I get to file criminal charges directly with the grand jury.
[02:36:45.248 --> 02:36:48.389]  And there's a number of innovative ways to get that.
[02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:53.332]  The grand jury is still as powerful as it always has been.
[02:36:53.332 --> 02:36:56.694]  It's just that the officials have gotten better at hiding them from us.
[02:36:57.853 --> 02:36:59.634]  They hate grand juries.
[02:36:59.634 --> 02:37:01.615]  Oh, no, they want to abolish them and regular juries.
[02:37:01.615 --> 02:37:04.797]  You bet they want to abolish grand juries.
[02:37:04.797 --> 02:37:12.942]  My district attorney in Wise County once told me, those damn grand jury members, they think what they're doing is important.
[02:37:12.942 --> 02:37:14.143]  I said, well, Barry, it is.
[02:37:14.143 --> 02:37:16.885]  I know that, but I wish they didn't.
[02:37:17.634 --> 02:37:20.576]  Because he never knows what they're going to do.
[02:37:20.576 --> 02:37:23.679]  Well, I mean, I want to get into your solutions here, and how you do it.
[02:37:23.679 --> 02:37:27.502]  We've talked some about that on your website, but go back to Williamson County a few months ago.
[02:37:27.502 --> 02:37:32.906]  Because you go to file this complaint on somebody's rights that are violated, and tell them what they did to you behind closed doors.
[02:37:32.906 --> 02:37:38.650]  Well, when the investigator came out and told me that the district attorney... Tell them what department this was.
[02:37:38.650 --> 02:37:39.071]  Go through it all.
[02:37:39.071 --> 02:37:40.452]  This was... I went to the district attorney.
[02:37:41.388 --> 02:37:44.369]  Hank handed his investigator a criminal complaint.
[02:37:44.369 --> 02:37:47.510]  If you go to the district attorney with a complaint, they'll always send you an investigator.
[02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:48.851]  So this is Round Rock or?
[02:37:48.851 --> 02:37:50.712]  This was Georgetown.
[02:37:50.712 --> 02:37:52.992]  Okay, Georgetown City District Attorney, okay.
[02:37:52.992 --> 02:37:55.473]  No, went to the county courthouse.
[02:37:55.473 --> 02:37:58.815]  Okay, I want to be clear, he went to the county of Williamson County.
[02:37:58.815 --> 02:38:01.656]  The county, the elected district attorney.
[02:38:01.656 --> 02:38:02.556]  Got it, county seat.
[02:38:02.556 --> 02:38:04.377]  Yeah, I wanted the highest one in the city.
[02:38:04.377 --> 02:38:06.297]  Got it, I just didn't know what jurisdiction, go ahead.
[02:38:06.297 --> 02:38:10.759]  Complaints against public officials always go to a district attorney, even if it's a Class C misdemeanor.
[02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:12.921]  By law.
[02:38:12.921 --> 02:38:14.622]  So I filed a complaint.
[02:38:14.622 --> 02:38:16.103]  I try to file it with a district attorney.
[02:38:16.103 --> 02:38:18.045]  When you try to do that, they'll never talk to you.
[02:38:18.045 --> 02:38:19.886]  They'll send out their investigator.
[02:38:19.886 --> 02:38:22.188]  So I got this trick for him.
[02:38:22.188 --> 02:38:24.530]  I make up a criminal complaint.
[02:38:24.530 --> 02:38:26.872]  And I asked the investigator, are you a certified police officer?
[02:38:26.872 --> 02:38:27.832]  And he said, yes, I am.
[02:38:27.832 --> 02:38:28.173]  Good.
[02:38:28.173 --> 02:38:29.234]  I need you here.
[02:38:29.234 --> 02:38:31.235]  Take this complaint and verify it.
[02:38:31.235 --> 02:38:33.817]  And it's a complaint against his boss.
[02:38:33.817 --> 02:38:35.939]  And he'll say, well, I can't verify that.
[02:38:35.939 --> 02:38:39.441]  If you're a certified police officer, you're authorized to verify criminal affidavits.
[02:38:39.441 --> 02:38:40.062]  Verify that.
[02:38:40.638 --> 02:38:45.419]  The first thing he does is goes to his boss because he's not even signing that document.
[02:38:45.419 --> 02:38:47.179]  So that gets rid of him.
[02:38:47.179 --> 02:38:55.041]  Well, he went to talk to the boss and came back and said the boss declined my offer to file criminal charges against this other police officer.
[02:38:55.041 --> 02:39:01.823]  And I told him I hate to hear that and took out my cell phone, dialed 9-1-1, asked them to send an officer out here to arrest the both of them.
[02:39:01.823 --> 02:39:03.643]  Class A misdemeanor, official misconduct.
[02:39:04.184 --> 02:39:07.285]  Violation 39.03 Penal Code.
[02:39:07.285 --> 02:39:08.646]  I'll swear out the complaint.
[02:39:08.646 --> 02:39:09.386]  I'll wait.
[02:39:09.386 --> 02:39:09.966]  And that's the thing.
[02:39:09.966 --> 02:39:12.687]  They break the law.
[02:39:12.687 --> 02:39:17.749]  Go back and explain that when they drive you to the jail, instead of imagine... I mean, explain that.
[02:39:17.749 --> 02:39:18.189]  Okay.
[02:39:18.189 --> 02:39:19.970]  It's just all crime.
[02:39:19.970 --> 02:39:25.192]  It was intended by our founders that the people not have a reason to fear their police.
[02:39:25.192 --> 02:39:29.174]  This was born out of the British running around arresting their own people for no reason.
[02:39:29.174 --> 02:39:32.855]  This thing of magistrates comes from Magna Carta.
[02:39:34.190 --> 02:39:35.491]  1200s.
[02:39:35.491 --> 02:39:35.771]  1215.
[02:39:35.771 --> 02:39:37.332]  That was a good idea.
[02:39:37.332 --> 02:39:41.494]  They said the policeman should not have the key to the jailhouse door.
[02:39:41.494 --> 02:39:45.596]  You can arrest somebody, but you take him directly to a magistrate and you explain yourself.
[02:39:45.596 --> 02:39:46.697]  Separation of powers.
[02:39:46.697 --> 02:39:53.961]  And it's not because they don't trust the policeman, but they want you to feel like the policeman didn't arrest him in prison.
[02:39:53.961 --> 02:39:57.142]  That he can arrest, but he's going to take you to somebody else and explain himself.
[02:39:57.142 --> 02:39:58.703]  And that also gives him protection.
[02:39:58.703 --> 02:39:59.984]  Exactly.
[02:39:59.984 --> 02:40:01.885]  So, in Wise County, they do that now.
[02:40:02.429 --> 02:40:03.349]  And the police like it.
[02:40:03.349 --> 02:40:04.389]  So you've made them do that?
[02:40:04.389 --> 02:40:05.410]  Yes.
[02:40:05.410 --> 02:40:08.250]  It kind of came about, took a long time, but they finally do that.
[02:40:08.250 --> 02:40:10.010]  Everybody likes it better.
[02:40:10.010 --> 02:40:14.851]  I never hear anyone in Wise County tell me about the police being jackbooted thugs.
[02:40:14.851 --> 02:40:17.032]  Just changed their whole perspective.
[02:40:17.032 --> 02:40:21.853]  The policeman likes it better, the magistrate likes it better, even the prosecutor likes it better.
[02:40:21.853 --> 02:40:26.294]  Because the magistrate throws out a lot of cases so he don't have to deal with them.
[02:40:26.294 --> 02:40:28.054]  But that's what they were supposed to do.
[02:40:29.071 --> 02:40:32.553]  But over a period of time... You're just getting lazy!
[02:40:32.553 --> 02:40:41.358]  Well, I think the real problem is the legislature told the prosecutor to give advice to the lower courts and the police.
[02:40:41.358 --> 02:40:46.261]  That's a prescription for exactly the disaster we see today.
[02:40:46.261 --> 02:40:53.465]  You think the prosecutor is going to say to the judge, well, I think you should do this here because it will make my life a living hell.
[02:40:53.465 --> 02:40:56.006]  No, he's going to advise them to do things that make
[02:40:56.798 --> 02:41:00.221]  The prosecution flow more efficiently.
[02:41:00.221 --> 02:41:10.049]  And over time, we gravitate away from... And now everything's plea bargain, and now they'll throw you in jail for five months before they even charge you, so they don't even have to make you plea bargain.
[02:41:10.049 --> 02:41:13.712]  I looked at the criminal court records in the county I live in.
[02:41:13.712 --> 02:41:14.613]  I was looking at one of them.
[02:41:14.613 --> 02:41:17.315]  There's nothing in there but the indictment and the deal.
[02:41:17.315 --> 02:41:18.436]  You can't tell he's been arrested.
[02:41:18.436 --> 02:41:19.857]  You can't tell anything.
[02:41:19.857 --> 02:41:21.358]  In the deal, he got 457 days' time served.
[02:41:24.156 --> 02:41:28.757]  He sat in jail 457 days before they could squeeze a deal out of him.
[02:41:28.757 --> 02:41:33.498]  No judge, no jury, you just go right to jail and they're gone.
[02:41:33.498 --> 02:41:37.139]  And not even any record at the court that you exist.
[02:41:37.139 --> 02:41:40.840]  He can't file motions, he can't do anything, he's in a legal limbo.
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:44.721]  And that's because the magistrate doesn't send the records to the clerk.
[02:41:44.721 --> 02:41:45.981]  But back to the policeman.
[02:41:45.981 --> 02:41:48.202]  When he arrests you, he's supposed to take you to that magistrate.
[02:41:49.259 --> 02:42:01.066]  And, according to the federal law, his only defense against an allegation of false imprisonment for timely, failure to timely take before a magistrate is a showing of due diligence and effort to locate.
[02:42:01.066 --> 02:42:08.551]  When he gets in that car, cranks that car, points it toward the jail as a matter of policy, that's aggravated kidnapping by definition.
[02:42:08.551 --> 02:42:10.612]  He violated a law relating to his office.
[02:42:10.612 --> 02:42:16.796]  He, his acts became false imprisonment, which is, in Texas, it's called kidnapping.
[02:42:17.395 --> 02:42:21.679]  And he did it whilst displaying a deadly weapon that makes it aggravated kidnapping.
[02:42:21.679 --> 02:42:24.501]  He took me and gave me to the jailers.
[02:42:24.501 --> 02:42:27.423]  They continued the kidnapping.
[02:42:27.423 --> 02:42:28.845]  They touched the tar baby.
[02:42:28.845 --> 02:42:31.066]  They don't just exceed their authority.
[02:42:31.066 --> 02:42:33.188]  Now, now, what do you do about police now?
[02:42:33.188 --> 02:42:41.295]  A lot of them seem to think that they'll go ahead of you, argue with them, and taser you, and then they bump their chest into you, or don't even do that now, and just charge you with assaulting them.
[02:42:41.295 --> 02:42:42.776]  What would you do with a case like that?
[02:42:42.776 --> 02:42:45.118]  That's what happened to me.
[02:42:45.118 --> 02:42:46.339]  And that's why they arrested me.
[02:42:47.176 --> 02:42:50.318]  And I was really upset when they dismissed the charges.
[02:42:50.318 --> 02:42:52.960]  I wanted him on the stand.
[02:42:52.960 --> 02:42:58.423]  On the stand, I'd elicit perjured testimony and ask that judge to have him arrested immediately.
[02:42:58.423 --> 02:43:04.467]  But, they arrested me and took me into a... First day, they went into this conference room.
[02:43:04.467 --> 02:43:07.929]  Oh yeah, to finish up with what happened in Williamson County, the assault began.
[02:43:07.929 --> 02:43:09.490]  Yeah, I gave him the complaint.
[02:43:09.490 --> 02:43:10.711]  Okay, yeah, go ahead.
[02:43:10.711 --> 02:43:12.812]  And he said the complaint was insufficient.
[02:43:14.042 --> 02:43:18.325]  I said, well, thank you anyway, but I don't need any legal advice.
[02:43:18.325 --> 02:43:22.589]  And they got real excited about that and started grilling me.
[02:43:22.589 --> 02:43:25.911]  And I finally told him this interview is over and started to leave.
[02:43:25.911 --> 02:43:28.293]  And they grabbed me and threw me in a chair.
[02:43:28.293 --> 02:43:29.574]  Just total third world country.
[02:43:29.574 --> 02:43:30.094]  Yes.
[02:43:30.094 --> 02:43:31.475]  Reach for my cell phone.
[02:43:31.475 --> 02:43:35.218]  He grabbed my arm, twisted it, ripped my cell phone out of my hand.
[02:43:35.218 --> 02:43:36.659]  I told him I need that to call 911.
[02:43:38.095 --> 02:43:39.777]  They said, we are 9-1-1.
[02:43:39.777 --> 02:43:42.099]  No, you're jackbooted, thugs.
[02:43:42.099 --> 02:43:45.503]  I need 9-1-1.
[02:43:45.503 --> 02:43:47.725]  By that time, Michael... You told them that?
[02:43:47.725 --> 02:43:48.906]  Michael Badnerik was there.
[02:43:48.906 --> 02:43:52.550]  He kind of backed up in a corner.
[02:43:52.550 --> 02:43:55.152]  The third time... The witness to this vampiric behavior.
[02:43:55.152 --> 02:43:55.773]  Yes.
[02:43:55.773 --> 02:44:00.838]  The third time they threw me in the chair, the police officer had his hand on my chest, pushing me backwards.
[02:44:01.644 --> 02:44:04.665]  I reached up and pushed his hand off and they arrested me for assault.
[02:44:04.665 --> 02:44:07.446]  So they assault you and if you defend yourself you're Al-Qaeda?
[02:44:07.446 --> 02:44:08.126]  Exactly.
[02:44:08.126 --> 02:44:08.927]  So where's that going?
[02:44:08.927 --> 02:44:09.747]  They've dropped it?
[02:44:09.747 --> 02:44:12.088]  They've dropped it and I'm upset about it.
[02:44:12.088 --> 02:44:15.049]  The prosecuting attorney dropped the charge.
[02:44:15.049 --> 02:44:15.849]  What a circus!
[02:44:15.849 --> 02:44:18.170]  Behind closed doors with these crazies?
[02:44:18.170 --> 02:44:19.730]  Well, they're not done yet.
[02:44:19.730 --> 02:44:22.491]  Actually, Debra helped me out on this one.
[02:44:22.491 --> 02:44:27.533]  I went to the county attorney because they dropped the interfering with public servant charge.
[02:44:28.573 --> 02:44:38.080]  And I had went to the court clerk, and there's no record with the court clerk that I was ever arrested, so I asked the prosecuting attorney, who dropped these charges?
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:39.661]  He said, well, I did.
[02:44:39.661 --> 02:44:41.883]  Well, how did you manage to drop them?
[02:44:41.883 --> 02:44:44.505]  There's no record in the court clerk they exist.
[02:44:44.505 --> 02:44:47.667]  Well, I dropped them in my capacity as a prosecuting attorney.
[02:44:48.291 --> 02:45:01.663]  I told him, well, that's all well and good, but I was hoping for something more specific, like a 32.02 Code of Criminal Procedure, which says a prosecuting attorney may not dismiss a prosecution except by submission of written motion to the court of jurisdiction, laying down cause for submission.
[02:45:01.663 --> 02:45:02.323]  Why they did it?
[02:45:02.323 --> 02:45:04.725]  Because for all we know, he could have been paid off to do it.
[02:45:04.725 --> 02:45:05.686]  You gotta have a record.
[02:45:05.686 --> 02:45:07.027]  Yeah, so what the heck did you get this?
[02:45:07.027 --> 02:45:11.631]  He said, well, a prosecution never started because I refused to take it.
[02:45:11.631 --> 02:45:12.292]  I said, wait a minute.
[02:45:12.896 --> 02:45:15.359]  I thought I spent 29 hours in your jail.
[02:45:15.359 --> 02:45:24.908]  And as I read the case law, a prosecution commences when a person is arrested or a criminal complaint is presented to a magistrate, which had to be, for him to find probable cause.
[02:45:24.908 --> 02:45:26.430]  So a prosecution commenced...
[02:45:27.586 --> 02:45:28.807]  You dismissed it.
[02:45:28.807 --> 02:45:30.929]  How did you even know it existed?
[02:45:30.929 --> 02:45:34.692]  Because the magistrate was supposed to send the records to the court clerk.
[02:45:34.692 --> 02:45:35.513]  How did you know?
[02:45:35.513 --> 02:45:37.414]  The court clerk doesn't have them.
[02:45:37.414 --> 02:45:43.079]  So whoever has them, has them in violation of 3710 Penal Code and they're committing a felony.
[02:45:43.079 --> 02:45:44.860]  Have you got those records?
[02:45:44.860 --> 02:45:46.922]  And he looked like a cat with a feather in his mouth.
[02:45:47.674 --> 02:45:50.595]  And Debra was standing behind me.
[02:45:50.595 --> 02:45:52.915]  Debra, that's my co-host, Debra Stevens.
[02:45:52.915 --> 02:45:57.376]  She stepped up and said, Randy, aren't you talking about the records that were supposed to go to the magistrate?
[02:45:57.376 --> 02:45:58.717]  And I said, yes.
[02:45:58.717 --> 02:46:00.877]  Well, look at that folder he's got in his hand there.
[02:46:00.877 --> 02:46:02.777]  Isn't that those records?
[02:46:02.777 --> 02:46:05.858]  And this prosecutor looked like he wanted a hole to crawl in.
[02:46:05.858 --> 02:46:10.519]  And she said, are any of those records in there from the magistrate?
[02:46:10.519 --> 02:46:12.500]  Well, yes, one of them.
[02:46:12.500 --> 02:46:14.240]  And Debra shut up, stepped back.
[02:46:15.518 --> 02:46:20.260]  And for Debra to stop talking abruptly, I thought that was rather strange, and I looked back at her.
[02:46:20.260 --> 02:46:23.642]  It wasn't until later I realized what she had done.
[02:46:23.642 --> 02:46:27.184]  She got the prosecutor to cop to a felony.
[02:46:27.184 --> 02:46:33.907]  And once she got it, she didn't pursue anymore, so he wouldn't have a chance to talk his way out of it.
[02:46:33.907 --> 02:46:40.070]  So I'll be filing felony tampering with a government document against the prosecutor for having my records.
[02:46:41.115 --> 02:46:41.855]  Let him explain.
[02:46:41.855 --> 02:46:46.617]  But see, they love to have false charges and set up old ladies and young kids.
[02:46:46.617 --> 02:46:48.938]  They get to have some of their own sick medicine.
[02:46:48.938 --> 02:46:50.239]  But you're doing it within the law.
[02:46:50.239 --> 02:46:50.699]  Yes.
[02:46:50.699 --> 02:46:51.819]  Oh, they hate this.
[02:46:51.819 --> 02:46:56.081]  Because they know I will go directly to the grand jury.
[02:46:56.081 --> 02:47:01.563]  Now, whether I actually get to the grand jury or not is not so important.
[02:47:01.563 --> 02:47:07.105]  Just making grand jury noises scares the bejesus out of these guys.
[02:47:07.105 --> 02:47:09.606]  They see their career flash before their eyes.
[02:47:10.447 --> 02:47:13.549]  The odds are that I'm not going to get an indictment.
[02:47:13.549 --> 02:47:16.472]  But, who wants to play Russian Roulette?
[02:47:16.472 --> 02:47:27.981]  But getting back to their psychology, I don't know how they have, like, in their minds, think we're like lumps of meat and aren't humans with lives and careers and ideas and hopes and dreams.
[02:47:27.981 --> 02:47:32.344]  I mean, it was crazy when the New York cops took me behind there and said, we're going to say you hit one of us.
[02:47:32.344 --> 02:47:33.265]  And they weren't messing with me.
[02:47:33.265 --> 02:47:34.526]  And I said, there's a lot of cameras out there.
[02:47:34.526 --> 02:47:35.747]  And they go, no, we're talking about in here.
[02:47:36.508 --> 02:47:38.449]  And I just said, I said, you know, do what you need to.
[02:47:38.449 --> 02:47:44.292]  But I said, I'm not, I said, I'm a big fish and I'm going to show you, you know, you can, you can beat the rabbit, you're not going to beat the ride.
[02:47:44.292 --> 02:47:45.853]  And they just said, all right, you know, tough guy.
[02:47:45.853 --> 02:47:50.416]  They wouldn't put me in a cell with human feces everywhere when they had other cells that were clean.
[02:47:50.416 --> 02:47:52.357]  But I mean, who wants that type of power?
[02:47:52.357 --> 02:47:53.818]  I would be embarrassed.
[02:47:53.818 --> 02:48:03.503]  I mean, I'm not like mean to my employees on purpose for a personal power trip, but I guess that's who, let's admit it, in some cases that's who wants to be a cop or a judge.
[02:48:04.854 --> 02:48:05.674]  That's part of the problem.
[02:48:05.674 --> 02:48:08.856]  I mean, they really enjoy squeezing people.
[02:48:08.856 --> 02:48:10.757]  And I've had enough of it.
[02:48:10.757 --> 02:48:13.858]  There's a lot of them out there that aren't that way.
[02:48:13.858 --> 02:48:16.959]  We just have to give them an opportunity to stand up.
[02:48:16.959 --> 02:48:23.182]  And it's unfortunate, the way we give them that opportunity is kick them right square in their behind.
[02:48:23.182 --> 02:48:26.183]  I equate that to my grandchildren.
[02:48:26.183 --> 02:48:28.464]  I love my grandchildren dearly.
[02:48:28.464 --> 02:48:31.886]  But if one of them runs out on the road, I'm fixing tan his hide.
[02:48:33.894 --> 02:48:39.436]  When you do this kind of thing, I suggest that people don't go file complaints in your own case.
[02:48:39.436 --> 02:48:41.536]  You've got too much involved.
[02:48:41.536 --> 02:48:44.597]  If you want to find out how this works, go pick a fight.
[02:48:44.597 --> 02:48:45.858]  Or a traffic ticket.
[02:48:45.858 --> 02:48:48.739]  I mean, what are you going to lose at a traffic ticket?
[02:48:48.739 --> 02:48:52.820]  If you lose, they're going to do the same thing they would do to you anyway.
[02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:55.041]  So heck, there's nothing to lose.
[02:48:55.041 --> 02:48:56.921]  Traffic tickets are great fun.
[02:48:56.921 --> 02:48:59.222]  My last traffic ticket was in Bell County.
[02:49:00.032 --> 02:49:04.813]  I asked the bailiff to drag the judge down off the bench three different times.
[02:49:04.813 --> 02:49:08.374]  And I told the judge, get down off that bench, you're disqualified.
[02:49:08.374 --> 02:49:11.255]  He jumped up, clear the jury, clear the jury.
[02:49:11.255 --> 02:49:12.715]  It was a hoot.
[02:49:12.715 --> 02:49:14.216]  What happened there?
[02:49:14.216 --> 02:49:16.997]  Oh, the jury found me incredibly guilty.
[02:49:16.997 --> 02:49:18.077]  But I was.
[02:49:18.077 --> 02:49:28.840]  I told them before we told the jury panel that these guys are going to get up here and they're going to put an officer up here and he's going to say that he clocked me doing 80 miles an hour in a 65 mile an hour zone.
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:29.260]  And he did.
[02:49:30.527 --> 02:49:31.267]  I was doing it.
[02:49:31.267 --> 02:49:32.807]  Well, then why'd you do this case, then?
[02:49:32.807 --> 02:49:35.428]  I'm here because they're bigger criminals than me.
[02:49:35.428 --> 02:49:40.749]  They have no authority to prosecute me because they're really the criminals, and oh, the prosecutor had a fit.
[02:49:40.749 --> 02:49:42.309]  And so you did it as an educational?
[02:49:42.309 --> 02:49:43.050]  Yes.
[02:49:43.050 --> 02:49:45.210]  And then what did you teach the jury?
[02:49:45.210 --> 02:49:53.412]  I had a motion to disqualify the judge before the court, and he turned it down himself.
[02:49:53.412 --> 02:49:54.192]  That's a crime.
[02:49:54.192 --> 02:49:55.972]  No, they have to let another judge look at that, don't they?
[02:49:55.972 --> 02:49:56.892]  Exactly.
[02:49:56.892 --> 02:49:59.673]  Motion to recuse the judge can deny himself.
[02:50:00.447 --> 02:50:03.469]  But a motion to disqualify, he cannot.
[02:50:03.469 --> 02:50:04.829]  But he did.
[02:50:04.829 --> 02:50:12.033]  And then after that, the first thing I did was ask the policeman when he signed his last oath of office.
[02:50:12.033 --> 02:50:13.854]  Prosecutor objected.
[02:50:13.854 --> 02:50:15.535]  The judge sustained.
[02:50:15.535 --> 02:50:19.197]  I said, Your Honor, I have a right to test the credibility of this witness.
[02:50:19.197 --> 02:50:21.838]  The judge said, Well, Mr. Kelton, this witness is credible.
[02:50:21.838 --> 02:50:24.060]  And just how did this witness become credible?
[02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:27.041]  He's credible because I say he's credible.
[02:50:27.041 --> 02:50:28.262]  Mr. Bailiff, did you hear that?
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:30.341]  Yes, Mr. Kelton, I did.
[02:50:30.341 --> 02:50:32.101]  Drag that judge down off that bench!
[02:50:32.101 --> 02:50:34.902]  Judge, you get down off that bench, you are disqualified!
[02:50:34.902 --> 02:50:37.763]  All right, we're doing the break for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:50:37.763 --> 02:50:38.263]  Tell us what happened.
[02:50:38.263 --> 02:50:39.504]  We'll come back, finish up.
[02:50:39.504 --> 02:50:42.465]  Tell folks, are you going to be having a seminar anytime soon?
[02:50:42.465 --> 02:50:43.205]  I hope to.
[02:50:43.205 --> 02:50:43.885]  We don't have... Well, good.
[02:50:43.885 --> 02:50:45.846]  Well, when that's coming up, we'll plug it here.
[02:50:45.846 --> 02:50:46.546]  We'll have you back on.
[02:50:48.806 --> 02:50:57.509]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds and oil of the hemp plant.

[02:51:13.993 --> 02:51:16.234]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[02:51:48.686 --> 02:51:50.087]  It is a big idea.
[02:51:50.087 --> 02:51:52.929]  A new world order.
[02:51:52.929 --> 02:51:57.812]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:51:57.812 --> 02:52:00.694]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:52:00.694 --> 02:52:02.776]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:52:03.442 --> 02:52:06.605]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:52:06.605 --> 02:52:13.932]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:52:16.969 --> 02:52:22.413]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:52:22.413 --> 02:52:26.275]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:52:26.275 --> 02:52:28.837]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:52:28.837 --> 02:52:29.998]  Most people have no idea.
[02:52:29.998 --> 02:52:30.798]  They're not after money.
[02:52:30.798 --> 02:52:32.059]  They have all the money they need.
[02:52:32.059 --> 02:52:33.060]  They're after power.
[02:52:33.060 --> 02:52:34.361]  That's what they're after these years.
[02:52:34.361 --> 02:52:38.964]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:52:42.926 --> 02:52:45.728]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslaving.
[02:52:45.728 --> 02:52:46.769]  You have been warned.
[02:52:48.009 --> 02:52:50.010]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:52:50.010 --> 02:52:56.971]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:52:56.971 --> 02:53:05.353]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:53:05.353 --> 02:53:11.074]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:53:11.254 --> 02:53:13.095]  My blood pressure has normalized.

[02:53:49.714 --> 02:53:55.538]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:55.538 --> 02:53:57.820]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:16.112 --> 02:54:22.978]  You were just telling me during the break about, um, in your own town with the judge threatening you and you pulled out the recorder.
[02:54:22.978 --> 02:54:27.161]  Yeah, the district, uh, all of them hate me except the county attorney.
[02:54:27.161 --> 02:54:28.502]  And I've been after him a long time.
[02:54:28.502 --> 02:54:35.347]  I never got anybody arrested in Wise County, never got anybody indicted, never even got anyone presented to the grand jury.
[02:54:35.347 --> 02:54:39.050]  But they do take everyone they arrest directly to the nearest magistrate.
[02:54:40.157 --> 02:54:44.299]  And that's because I just kept harassing them.
[02:54:44.299 --> 02:54:49.122]  I didn't get them indicted, but I was always so close.
[02:54:49.122 --> 02:54:52.044]  They're literally playing Russian roulette with me.
[02:54:52.044 --> 02:54:55.526]  And I was just telling the story the last time I spoke to my district judge.
[02:54:55.526 --> 02:55:01.810]  I was in his courtroom, talking to his bailiff, and he ran in and said, Mr. Kelton, you're creating a disturbance.
[02:55:01.810 --> 02:55:04.871]  You get out of this courthouse, or I'll have you arrested.
[02:55:04.871 --> 02:55:05.832]  I reached in my pocket.
[02:55:05.832 --> 02:55:06.813]  I said, I'm sorry, judge.
[02:55:06.813 --> 02:55:07.853]  I didn't have this turned on.
[02:55:07.853 --> 02:55:09.254]  Pulled out a little digital recorder.
[02:55:09.995 --> 02:55:13.737]  Clicked it on, stuck it in his face and said, will you say that again?
[02:55:13.737 --> 02:55:18.860]  And he was looked at me and was breathing hard and I know what he was thinking.
[02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:20.861]  That damn district attorney.
[02:55:20.861 --> 02:55:23.262]  He didn't tell me everything.
[02:55:23.262 --> 02:55:25.003]  The judge was right.
[02:55:25.003 --> 02:55:30.186]  I was talking to the bailiff because the high sheriff of the county sent me to talk to the bailiff.
[02:55:30.186 --> 02:55:34.228]  In order to file criminal charges against the district attorney.
[02:55:34.228 --> 02:55:36.950]  The district attorney told the judge I was creating a disturbance.
[02:55:37.503 --> 02:55:43.527]  I filed making a terroristic threat against the District Judge with the Attorney General.
[02:55:43.527 --> 02:55:52.573]  The only time the Attorney General is the prosecutor of original jurisdiction is in a matter of a complaint against a District Attorney under open records.
[02:55:52.573 --> 02:56:00.478]  But how did it get so corrupt all over the country where none of them follow proper procedure, none of them follow the state and federal law, they just do whatever they want?
[02:56:00.478 --> 02:56:04.121]  I have a document on my website I call the Frog Farm Conspiracy.
[02:56:05.641 --> 02:56:11.703]  Uh, and the reason I call it that is Samuel Clements once said, you take a frog, throw him in a pot of hot water, he'd jump out.
[02:56:11.703 --> 02:56:17.525]  Take that same frog, put him in a pot of cold water, gradually raise the heat.
[02:56:17.525 --> 02:56:34.850]  Well, over time, through a series of seemingly minor adjustments toward administrative convenience and adjudicative expediency, we took one little step out after another outside the legal limits, and then one day we look around and wonder how we got in this mess.
[02:56:36.152 --> 02:56:45.060]  And it's bad, but on the other hand, because it's so bad, it gives us a lot more power in changing it.
[02:56:45.060 --> 02:56:50.224]  They are so far away from rule of law, they have zero defense.
[02:56:50.224 --> 02:56:53.527]  And all we have to do is keep hammering them.
[02:56:53.527 --> 02:56:56.290]  Right now, I'm just one person.
[02:56:56.290 --> 02:56:58.732]  And just one person.
[02:56:58.732 --> 02:57:03.276]  I've got all of the judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals wondering if they're going to get indicted.
[02:57:05.253 --> 02:57:09.116]  That's extremely powerful, even if I don't get them indicted.
[02:57:09.116 --> 02:57:09.997]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[02:57:09.997 --> 02:57:20.345]  I want to hold you over five minutes, if we can, in the next hour, and then we're going to get Senator Karen Johnson on for a 50-plus minute interview and take calls, listeners, on 9-11 and all these big developments that have happened there.
[02:57:20.345 --> 02:57:24.748]  But when we come back, I want you to answer this for me in the five minutes we've got left.
[02:57:24.748 --> 02:57:27.590]  Here's an example of what we did.
[02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:32.894]  You know, with the absent student assistance program, ASAP, in 98-99,
[02:57:34.924 --> 02:57:48.438]  If your child didn't go to school one morning with the flu and you'd had the flu or forgot to call, the police would come demand in, threaten parents, they would arrest you, but truancy was 14 absences unexcused in a semester.
[02:57:48.438 --> 02:57:55.184]  So we went to the county commissioner's court and would read the law and say, and we found out that they would take three late
[02:57:59.127 --> 02:58:02.728]  You know, sixth graders being late to class three times and call that an absence?
[02:58:02.728 --> 02:58:06.489]  And they would bring them into these little portable buildings and say that it wasn't real court.
[02:58:06.489 --> 02:58:07.209]  We got video of it.
[02:58:07.209 --> 02:58:08.629]  They would just say, sign a document.
[02:58:08.629 --> 02:58:11.670]  We're signing them on a probation via contract fraud.
[02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:13.090]  And we cut back on some of that.
[02:58:13.090 --> 02:58:13.871]  Now they're back with it.
[02:58:13.871 --> 02:58:15.351]  I mean, I can't fight everything.
[02:58:15.351 --> 02:58:18.232]  But the point is, it's not even laws.
[02:58:18.232 --> 02:58:20.072]  I mean, it's all fraud.
[02:58:20.072 --> 02:58:21.672]  So what about contract fraud with you?
[02:58:21.672 --> 02:58:23.713]  Because you're talking about how to keep them accountable.
[02:58:23.713 --> 02:58:27.354]  I mean, just for the average public to know the government is criminal, stop trusting them.

[02:59:33.084 --> 02:59:38.390]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:59:58.294 --> 03:00:01.295]  I was talking about all over the country, the Feds paid to have this done.
[03:00:01.295 --> 03:00:05.597]  They, uh... Well, I had a news article the other day, I haven't covered it yet.
[03:00:05.597 --> 03:00:11.999]  Bob, do you have that article where the little kid fell asleep at his table?
[03:00:11.999 --> 03:00:15.360]  His family had been in the hospital, it was his sister or his mother, I forget the article.
[03:00:15.360 --> 03:00:17.521]  This was admitted, I remember seeing this in the paper.
[03:00:17.521 --> 03:00:21.182]  So he fell asleep, his little head, they'd been at the hospital all night, he still went to school.
[03:00:21.182 --> 03:00:25.944]  And the officer came in, arrested him, charged him with disorderly conduct, sleeping, was disorderly.
[03:00:26.707 --> 03:00:30.148]  And now he's on probation and he visits the probation officer.
[03:00:30.148 --> 03:00:31.128]  And that's the new system.
[03:00:31.128 --> 03:00:34.709]  You know, 10 years in prison in Florida for speeding.
[03:00:34.709 --> 03:00:36.929]  You know, a year in prison for an apple peel.
[03:00:36.929 --> 03:00:39.610]  I mean, for an apple core or a banana peel on the ground.
[03:00:39.610 --> 03:00:44.531]  I mean, you know, it's total control where they're now arresting you for no seatbelt.
[03:00:44.531 --> 03:00:47.092]  They're now arresting you for no turn signal.
[03:00:47.092 --> 03:00:47.952]  They'll taser you.
[03:00:47.952 --> 03:00:52.093]  I mean, they taser you in Canada if you don't pay to get on the train.
[03:00:52.093 --> 03:00:54.594]  I mean, and they say this is your punishment.
[03:00:54.594 --> 03:00:56.114]  I mean, it's psycho.
[03:00:56.952 --> 03:00:58.694]  What's happened?
[03:00:58.694 --> 03:01:01.356]  We've lost our grand juries.
[03:01:01.356 --> 03:01:05.460]  There is a different way of appealing.
[03:01:05.460 --> 03:01:13.588]  When I was before the head district judge here in Travis County and he suggested I file my complaints with the Sheriff's Department, I told him I did and they threw it in the trash.
[03:01:13.588 --> 03:01:19.174]  He said, well, I needed to appeal that to a higher court and petition for a writ of mandamus and I told him, well,
[03:01:19.890 --> 03:01:20.610]  I don't know, Judge.
[03:01:20.610 --> 03:01:24.633]  You know, you go before a corrupt judge and he renders a corrupt decision.
[03:01:24.633 --> 03:01:26.574]  So they tell you, oh, that's okay.
[03:01:26.574 --> 03:01:30.916]  You can go before a whole panel of corrupt judges and they can screw your royal.
[03:01:30.916 --> 03:01:32.917]  He said, well, Mr. Calton, I don't think it's that bad.
[03:01:32.917 --> 03:01:35.219]  Yeah, that's because you're not pro se.
[03:01:35.219 --> 03:01:38.441]  I would much rather appeal to a grand jury.
[03:01:38.441 --> 03:01:40.162]  He said, well, you can't appeal to a grand jury.
[03:01:40.162 --> 03:01:40.682]  Sure I can.
[03:01:41.582 --> 03:01:47.846]  I could appeal to them with allegations of shielding from prosecution against the officer and see if they can get him arrested.
[03:01:47.846 --> 03:01:50.568]  Much better to take your complaint to a grand jury.
[03:01:50.568 --> 03:02:03.037]  But I mean, how do they humanly, I guess it's all about revenue, a little kid who's an A student falls asleep, 11 years old, and they arrest him and his life's basically criminal from now on.
[03:02:03.037 --> 03:02:04.238]  He'll never get out of their system.
[03:02:04.238 --> 03:02:06.559]  That's part of the basic programming.
[03:02:06.559 --> 03:02:09.161]  Oh, they admit the schools are to get you ready for prison.
[03:02:09.161 --> 03:02:09.902]  The biggest
[03:02:10.788 --> 03:02:15.889]  The biggest hurdle I have to come over is the programming you had in school.
[03:02:15.889 --> 03:02:26.772]  You go to school for 12 years and they tell you about all these great and wonderful rights that you have, and all these privileges that you have as a citizen, but don't even think of trying to express one of those while you're in this school.
[03:02:26.772 --> 03:02:30.613]  Because if you do, the whole weight of the world will fall right on your heads.
[03:02:30.613 --> 03:02:32.674]  But the schools are designed to hurt our children.
[03:02:34.654 --> 03:02:40.380]  Did you hear about the case with We Are Change in Kentucky, who had press passes and the cops tackled them and stole their stuff?
[03:02:40.380 --> 03:02:41.181]  No, I didn't hear about that.
[03:02:41.181 --> 03:02:45.225]  And then now they call the cops, and the cops go, we don't have those officers working here, and it turns out they do.
[03:02:45.225 --> 03:02:47.747]  I mean, what do you do when they just deny it?
[03:02:47.747 --> 03:02:51.431]  And the cop would come walking out in his uniform, and they'll laugh and say, doesn't exist, slave!
[03:02:51.431 --> 03:02:54.254]  Don't even go to, I don't even talk to the policemen.
[03:02:54.254 --> 03:02:56.936]  Once they've screwed up, I go up.
[03:02:56.936 --> 03:02:58.438]  First place I want to go is grand jury.
[03:02:59.304 --> 03:03:01.365]  And the prosecutor's gonna say, well, you gotta file it with me.
[03:03:01.365 --> 03:03:02.305]  Okay, I'll file it with you.
[03:03:02.305 --> 03:03:04.566]  And then he'll refuse to give them to the grand jury.
[03:03:04.566 --> 03:03:06.206]  Then I'll file against both of them.
[03:03:06.206 --> 03:03:08.227]  You get up there in the higher areas.
[03:03:08.227 --> 03:03:09.047]  We're the sovereigns.
[03:03:09.047 --> 03:03:10.528]  We can do that.
[03:03:10.528 --> 03:03:13.109]  We go up... You mean we're human beings?
[03:03:13.109 --> 03:03:14.169]  They forgot that.
[03:03:14.169 --> 03:03:16.050]  I thought they're authorities and we're scum.
[03:03:16.050 --> 03:03:18.811]  Well, I tend to remind them that I'm sovereign.
[03:03:18.811 --> 03:03:22.232]  I never tell them I'm sovereign, but I do things that sovereigns do.
[03:03:23.439 --> 03:03:26.081]  I don't care what they say about a grand jury.
[03:03:26.081 --> 03:03:34.106]  From what I can find in Texas, there's no law in Texas that says I cannot approach the foreman of the grand jury while he's sitting on the toilet.
[03:03:34.106 --> 03:03:36.988]  If it doesn't say I can't do it, I can do it.
[03:03:36.988 --> 03:03:43.933]  So I go to the highest courts, I go to the highest judges, and the grand jury at the drop of a hat.
[03:03:43.933 --> 03:03:46.955]  Well, Randy, we're going to have to have you back up for two hours to take calls sometime.
[03:03:46.955 --> 03:03:47.916]  Very interesting fellow.
[03:03:47.916 --> 03:03:49.897]  I plan to get George Gordon back on the show, too.
[03:03:49.897 --> 03:03:51.999]  I haven't had him on in about five, six years.
[03:03:52.809 --> 03:04:01.496]  As we explore other areas, but the website is jurisimprudence.com.
[03:04:01.496 --> 03:04:06.699]  And in the next month or so, we'll have another seminar here in Austin or any surrounding area.
[03:04:06.699 --> 03:04:09.361]  I'd like to have you back in the studio to plug that.
[03:04:09.361 --> 03:04:10.642]  Randy Kelton, thanks for the time.
[03:04:10.642 --> 03:04:14.045]  We also have a website, Rule of Law Radio.
[03:04:14.045 --> 03:04:15.205]  It's a little easier to remember.
[03:04:15.205 --> 03:04:16.987]  Ruleoflawradio.com.
[03:04:16.987 --> 03:04:19.028]  I'm sure my good friend Danny will appreciate that.
[03:04:19.028 --> 03:04:19.849]  Thank you for coming in.
[03:04:19.849 --> 03:04:21.010]  I appreciate it.
[03:04:21.010 --> 03:04:21.490]  Thank you, Randy.
[03:04:46.143 --> 03:04:47.544]  It is a big idea.
[03:04:47.544 --> 03:04:50.386]  A new world order.
[03:04:50.386 --> 03:04:54.569]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:04:55.290 --> 03:04:58.092]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:04:58.092 --> 03:05:00.894]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:05:00.894 --> 03:05:04.076]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:05:04.076 --> 03:05:11.381]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:05:14.415 --> 03:05:19.857]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:05:19.857 --> 03:05:23.738]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:05:23.738 --> 03:05:26.299]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:05:26.299 --> 03:05:27.460]  Most people have no idea.
[03:05:27.460 --> 03:05:28.240]  They're not after money.
[03:05:28.240 --> 03:05:29.521]  They have all the money they need.
[03:05:29.521 --> 03:05:30.501]  They're after power.
[03:05:30.501 --> 03:05:31.661]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[03:05:40.367 --> 03:05:43.170]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:05:43.170 --> 03:05:44.331]  You have been warned.
[03:05:46.047 --> 03:05:46.847]  Hi, neighbor.
[03:05:46.847 --> 03:05:50.129]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[03:05:50.129 --> 03:05:55.412]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[03:05:55.412 --> 03:06:01.155]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[03:06:01.155 --> 03:06:08.759]  We would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[03:06:08.759 --> 03:06:13.662]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[03:06:14.282 --> 03:06:22.089]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[03:06:22.089 --> 03:06:27.213]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[03:06:27.213 --> 03:06:27.513]  Call 800-409-5633.

[03:07:53.620 --> 03:07:56.603]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:04.927 --> 03:08:05.527]  Okay!
[03:08:05.527 --> 03:08:11.210]  I was so busy during the break doing so much, I forgot to ask if we have our next great guest lined up, John.
[03:08:11.210 --> 03:08:12.311]  Fantastic!
[03:08:12.311 --> 03:08:18.054]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, now well into this fourth hour.
[03:08:18.054 --> 03:08:22.316]  And, uh, we just had a real character in studio with us, really nice fellow, Randy Kelton.
[03:08:22.316 --> 03:08:26.739]  We have state, uh, Senator Karen Johnson on with us, former CIA
[03:08:27.834 --> 03:08:31.057]  Briefer, top analyst for Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[03:08:31.057 --> 03:08:32.438]  will be joining us Friday.
[03:08:32.438 --> 03:08:34.840]  Just thought I'd tell you that guest is confirmed.
[03:08:34.840 --> 03:08:42.246]  We have some other big guests lined up that will remain secret until they're on air with us later this week.
[03:08:42.246 --> 03:08:50.273]  Going to Karen Johnson, who's just an amazing lady and has taken a lot of heat for coming out and questioning the official 9-11 fairy tale.
[03:08:51.970 --> 03:09:05.022]  Uh, Karen, Jesse Ventura's gone further on this show and other shows the last two days, saying that he thinks 9-11 was partially an insurance fraud blowing up the buildings, and that he believes our government may have done it, not just that he thinks we're being lied to.
[03:09:05.022 --> 03:09:11.448]  And, you know, you can love him, you can hate him, the point is it takes courage to do this, and it's really starting to break into the mainstream media.
[03:09:11.448 --> 03:09:12.209]  What do you think about this?
[03:09:13.061 --> 03:09:16.942]  Well, I absolutely think that Jesse Ventura has courage.
[03:09:16.942 --> 03:09:17.943]  That is for sure.
[03:09:17.943 --> 03:09:23.905]  I often wonder what Mr. Larry Silverstein is doing these days.
[03:09:23.905 --> 03:09:28.466]  Oh, he just now got some new multi-billion dollar settlement.
[03:09:28.466 --> 03:09:31.107]  And he's suing, I think, for $12 billion to get even more.
[03:09:31.107 --> 03:09:38.669]  I mean, he is doing quite nicely on a $189 million investment made two months before the attacks.
[03:09:38.669 --> 03:09:40.190]  Yeah, that's quite interesting.
[03:09:42.495 --> 03:09:44.557]  Well, it's just amazing is what it is.
[03:09:44.557 --> 03:09:48.739]  I wanted to get you on for most of an hour to take phone calls for folks that wanted to talk about 9-11.
[03:09:48.739 --> 03:09:52.782]  There's a perfect way to do it with all the things that are breaking at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:09:52.782 --> 03:10:09.454]  But I wanted to, with you, talk about, I mean, you said day one you questioned the official story, but I also wanted to walk through, you know, some of the main points you think people should look at, Senator.
[03:10:10.720 --> 03:10:19.364]  Well, first of all, if I can, Alex, I want to tell you about something that we are proposing to do out here in the Phoenix area.
[03:10:19.364 --> 03:10:21.085]  I'm very, very excited about it.
[03:10:21.085 --> 03:10:39.775]  We had what we call a 9-11 meet-up group last night, and there is a gentleman by the name of Blaine who is going to do what we're calling hunger for truth, and he is going to do a fast that he is beginning out in front of Senator John McCain's office.
[03:10:40.470 --> 03:10:41.891]  Uh, on Memorial Day.
[03:10:41.891 --> 03:10:47.414]  He will begin that this coming Monday on Memorial Day and go as long as he can.
[03:10:47.414 --> 03:10:51.456]  You know, hopefully he won't have to go more than a couple weeks.
[03:10:51.456 --> 03:11:02.923]  What he's asking for is two hours of Senator McCain's time to try and show him the realities of 9-11, the real truth that's going on there.
[03:11:03.610 --> 03:11:19.596]  And there's going to be some complementary things going on around the country, like also at Barack Obama's office in Chicago, at Hillary Clinton's office in New York, even Nancy Pelosi's office in San Francisco.
[03:11:19.596 --> 03:11:28.759]  So these areas are also going to be targeted with 9-11 people for truth that are trying to get these legislators
[03:11:29.509 --> 03:11:31.350]  Tell us more about this, Senator.
[03:11:45.667 --> 03:12:00.031]  Well, you know, if you trust your eyes, you just look at the pictures, you can see that Building 7 is falling down, not because it was hit by a plane, but because of explosions, because of demolitions.
[03:12:00.031 --> 03:12:02.672]  And, you know, how do you account for that?
[03:12:04.321 --> 03:12:05.842]  Well, you know, we didn't play all of this.
[03:12:05.842 --> 03:12:08.143]  It's about three minutes long.
[03:12:08.143 --> 03:12:15.986]  If it's OK, would you like to hear Jesse Ventura on that rascal Howard Stern this morning?
[03:12:15.986 --> 03:12:22.569]  They attacked him because of his appearance here yesterday and a month and a half ago when he first went public saying it's an inside job.
[03:12:22.569 --> 03:12:23.910]  And he went further than ever here.
[03:12:23.910 --> 03:12:26.131]  And I want you to respond to the disinfo.
[03:12:26.131 --> 03:12:31.253]  That's why we're playing this clip so we can critique it and analyze it for fair use here.
[03:12:31.253 --> 03:12:32.594]  But I want to get your take on that.
[03:12:33.594 --> 03:12:35.396]  You're game to listen to this, right?
[03:12:35.396 --> 03:12:36.457]  Sure, you bet.
[03:12:36.457 --> 03:12:38.599]  Okay, go ahead and roll it.
[03:12:38.599 --> 03:12:45.224]  Hey, you're one of those guys who believes, you know, that 9-11, that you don't believe two planes knocked down three buildings, right?
[03:12:45.224 --> 03:12:58.756]  Well, I believed it when it happened, and then after I got out of office, my son kept badgering me to pay attention to these things on the internet, and I finally did, and I started studying it, and I started opening my eyes a little.
[03:12:59.376 --> 03:13:02.917]  And there's a lot of very difficult questions that have not been answered.
[03:13:02.917 --> 03:13:04.858]  No one seems to want to provide an answer.
[03:13:04.858 --> 03:13:06.718]  What's the most difficult question that you see?
[03:13:06.718 --> 03:13:14.061]  Well, that a third building could fall into its own footprint five hours later, having not been struck by much of anything.
[03:13:14.061 --> 03:13:15.201]  So what do you think happened?
[03:13:15.201 --> 03:13:17.262]  How did that happen?
[03:13:17.262 --> 03:13:20.223]  The 9-11 Commission didn't even address the issue.
[03:13:20.223 --> 03:13:21.143]  So what do you think happened?
[03:13:22.163 --> 03:13:27.445]  Um, I'd hate to fear what could have happened, but possibly we did it to ourselves.
[03:13:27.445 --> 03:13:28.465]  You're kidding me!
[03:13:28.465 --> 03:13:39.188]  Well, Howard, I worked in demolition and was trained by the best guys in the United States Navy, being a frogman, and how could those buildings fall at the rate of gravity?
[03:13:39.855 --> 03:13:40.916]  Well, let me ask you something.
[03:13:40.916 --> 03:13:50.660]  It seems to me, I don't know much about this, but when jets go right into a building, couldn't there be so much trauma to the area that things can fall?
[03:13:50.660 --> 03:13:59.804]  No, because if you study how they built the buildings, those buildings were made to withstand a 707, which is that old plane with the four engines on the wing.
[03:13:59.804 --> 03:14:00.384]  Right.
[03:14:00.384 --> 03:14:02.565]  Well, that's as big as what hit it.
[03:14:02.565 --> 03:14:07.387]  And by my studying, they said it was built to... And then I'll get the Senator's comment.
[03:14:08.476 --> 03:14:12.238]  Talking to Senator Karen Johnson from Arizona.
[03:14:12.238 --> 03:14:20.623]  I actually have played clips of Nomuro Yamasaki, the designer, the architect, and the structural engineer.
[03:14:20.623 --> 03:14:22.424]  I forget his exact title.
[03:14:22.424 --> 03:14:27.267]  He was the head engineer over its actual construction, the construction engineer.
[03:14:27.267 --> 03:14:30.189]  And he went public.
[03:14:30.189 --> 03:14:30.669]  We have the clip.
[03:14:30.669 --> 03:14:37.013]  We can play it again, I guess, where he says it was designed to take two strikes per tower of a plane as big or bigger.
[03:14:38.315 --> 03:14:39.836]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[03:14:39.836 --> 03:14:41.938]  Would you like to comment on that?
[03:14:41.938 --> 03:14:44.981]  Well, Alex, I definitely agree.
[03:14:44.981 --> 03:14:49.826]  You know, when you look at Building 7, I think it was 47 stories.
[03:14:49.826 --> 03:14:53.630]  The Twin Towers were approximately 110.
[03:14:53.630 --> 03:15:01.077]  And from what we were able to observe over and over and over, those planes hit close to the top of those towers.
[03:15:01.630 --> 03:15:08.312]  And, you know, I can see the top part of it perhaps toppling over, but there is no way.
[03:15:08.312 --> 03:15:09.693]  Fires burn up.
[03:15:09.693 --> 03:15:11.153]  They don't burn down.
[03:15:11.153 --> 03:15:23.278]  And for that, at least, I mean, I'm no expert on this, but to have it go all the way down, a fire from jet fuel, which doesn't even burn hot enough to melt steel,
[03:15:26.500 --> 03:15:38.287]  Well, then we have the NASA and FBI photos from aircraft and space showing 2600 plus degrees, close to 1000 degrees hotter than jet fuel does at its hottest.
[03:15:38.287 --> 03:15:39.328]  I mean, this is insane!
[03:15:39.938 --> 03:16:01.537]  This is absolutely amazing, and the firefighters reported molten steel flowing like lava down in there, and then you have BBC reporting that Building 7 fell 25 minutes before it fell, and giving the exact official story of how it then... I mean, that's like with the JFK murder, how New Zealand and Australia and Thailand and others reported before they even announced in the U.S.
[03:16:01.537 --> 03:16:05.941]  or caught him, that it was Lee Harvey Oswald and he'd done it because they got their time zones off.
[03:16:06.816 --> 03:16:08.317]  You are right on, Alex.
[03:16:08.317 --> 03:16:17.022]  I still, you know, I've got a picture of that gal, a reporter from the BBC, and she reported, I think, about 5 p.m.
[03:16:17.022 --> 03:16:25.127]  that Building 7 had already collapsed, and it didn't collapse until 5.20, and it's in, you can see it behind her, still standing.
[03:16:25.127 --> 03:16:26.488]  I mean, what's going on here?
[03:16:26.488 --> 03:16:29.530]  Well, I think we've done the best presentation of that in the new edition of Terror Storm.
[03:16:29.530 --> 03:16:32.452]  That's why I hope people get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:16:33.932 --> 03:16:40.416]  Karen, I mean, I don't want to focus on how you've been attacked, because, you know, for all the attacks you've been loved a million times more.
[03:16:40.416 --> 03:16:47.139]  I mean, even the polls show the majority of people know it's an inside job now, not just, you know, that they're being lied to.
[03:16:47.139 --> 03:16:56.163]  But what's, I mean, the ridiculous attacks you've been under, and the things that some local papers have said, I mean, it's really sophomoric, and that's why they're losing all their subscribers.
[03:16:56.163 --> 03:16:58.444]  That's why the mainstream corporate media is falling apart.
[03:16:58.444 --> 03:17:00.525]  So, in a way, they're just destroying themselves.
[03:17:01.822 --> 03:17:06.527]  And Alex, you're right about that, and to me, that is what is so encouraging today.
[03:17:06.527 --> 03:17:16.537]  I cannot tell you the amount of email that I have gotten from people that are going, hey, we think you're right, we want to help, we want to look into this.
[03:17:16.537 --> 03:17:21.101]  My wonderful, able assistant, you know, is beginning to put together
[03:17:23.021 --> 03:17:27.945]  You know, a whole directory of these folks so that we can keep in touch with them.
[03:17:27.945 --> 03:17:30.827]  Now, I'm not saying that we don't get some pretty nasty ones.
[03:17:30.827 --> 03:17:38.653]  I got one recently from some Republican, you know, that's trying to get me thrown out of the party, and I'm thinking, you don't have to worry about that.
[03:17:38.653 --> 03:17:40.595]  I could leave myself pretty easy.
[03:17:40.595 --> 03:17:41.555]  Hey, don't worry!
[03:17:41.555 --> 03:17:52.664]  The Republicans that guy likes are for open borders, total gun control, amnesty, giant taxes, tripled BATF, our name destroyed, our dollar destroyed,
[03:17:53.605 --> 03:17:55.406]  John McCain, a total communist.
[03:17:55.406 --> 03:17:56.747]  I mean, they ought to be happy.
[03:17:56.747 --> 03:18:00.010]  Don't worry, real Republicans like you are very rare now.
[03:18:00.010 --> 03:18:01.251]  Oh my gosh.
[03:18:01.251 --> 03:18:08.697]  We do have a pretty good wing here in Arizona that, you know, we're staunchly behind Ron Paul, and we still are.
[03:18:08.697 --> 03:18:11.800]  No, I know that, but I mean in the highest power positions.
[03:18:11.800 --> 03:18:12.520]  Oh yeah.
[03:18:12.520 --> 03:18:20.267]  I mean, of course, the party would win and take over if you were constitutionalist, but they act like wonderful people like you are bad instead of the leadership.
[03:18:21.013 --> 03:18:22.675]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[03:18:22.675 --> 03:18:23.937]  We're nothing.
[03:18:23.937 --> 03:18:26.240]  We're non-entities.
[03:18:26.240 --> 03:18:30.465]  It's pretty sad, but the people themselves are out there, Alex.
[03:18:30.465 --> 03:18:32.167]  They listen to folks like you.
[03:18:32.167 --> 03:18:33.609]  They get on the internet.
[03:18:33.609 --> 03:18:36.333]  They search themselves because they're truth seekers.
[03:18:37.113 --> 03:18:38.734]  And that's what we have to have.
[03:18:38.734 --> 03:18:40.914]  By the way, that's true.
[03:18:40.914 --> 03:18:43.475]  Free Republic is one of the biggest websites in the world.
[03:18:43.475 --> 03:18:46.055]  Now we're bigger than they are.
[03:18:46.055 --> 03:18:54.077]  No one goes to them because it's literally low-grade morons saying open borders, New World Order, North American Union are good.
[03:18:54.077 --> 03:18:54.998]  And so they're gone.
[03:18:54.998 --> 03:19:00.579]  I mean, the other big sites are shadows of what they were because they had to sell out to the neocons.
[03:19:01.502 --> 03:19:03.283]  Well, we've got to keep going.
[03:19:03.283 --> 03:19:05.004]  We've got to get more information out.
[03:19:05.004 --> 03:19:08.185]  We have to get more, you know, converts, Alex.
[03:19:08.185 --> 03:19:09.966]  And that's what we're trying to do here.
[03:19:09.966 --> 03:19:14.588]  And I will keep speaking out no matter what.
[03:19:14.588 --> 03:19:15.669]  Well, you're wonderful.
[03:19:15.669 --> 03:19:16.989]  What else?
[03:19:16.989 --> 03:19:17.609]  We're about to go to break.
[03:19:17.609 --> 03:19:24.533]  When we come back, I want to hear from Karen Johnson about whatever is on her mind, where she thinks this country's going, if you're positive about the future or negative.
[03:19:24.533 --> 03:19:25.953]  And then we're going to take calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:19:25.953 --> 03:19:26.594]  We've got her for another
[03:19:30.202 --> 03:19:32.165]  Well, 40 minutes to be exact.
[03:19:32.165 --> 03:19:34.589]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:19:34.589 --> 03:19:37.374]  Pretty much any issues game, but 9-11's encouraged.
[03:19:37.374 --> 03:19:43.584]  Don't forget, big stories up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with the breaking Jesse Ventura story.
[03:19:43.584 --> 03:19:44.565]  Please help us get this out.
[03:19:46.377 --> 03:19:50.201]  Cardivite is probably the most misunderstood supplement today.

[03:20:45.595 --> 03:20:47.556]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:20:47.556 --> 03:20:51.178]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:20:51.178 --> 03:20:53.640]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:20:53.640 --> 03:20:56.681]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:20:56.681 --> 03:21:02.405]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:21:02.405 --> 03:21:06.327]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[03:21:43.731 --> 03:21:45.773]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:21:45.773 --> 03:21:49.256]  Yes, there is an in-dash AM FM shortwave radio.

[03:22:45.334 --> 03:22:51.179]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[03:22:51.179 --> 03:22:56.604]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[03:22:56.604 --> 03:23:01.989]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[03:23:01.989 --> 03:23:07.894]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[03:23:07.894 --> 03:23:12.158]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life,
[03:23:12.358 --> 03:23:14.099]  Most people are overly acidic.
[03:23:14.099 --> 03:23:17.882]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[03:23:17.882 --> 03:23:22.706]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[03:23:22.706 --> 03:23:23.747]  Do your part.
[03:23:23.747 --> 03:23:26.369]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[03:23:26.369 --> 03:23:32.494]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink

[03:23:43.503 --> 03:23:54.072]  Look at your young men fighting.
[03:23:54.072 --> 03:23:56.153]  Look at your women crying.
[03:23:56.153 --> 03:23:59.676]  Look at your young men dying.
[03:24:03.900 --> 03:24:11.988]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24:11.988 --> 03:24:13.830]  I need your help.
[03:24:13.830 --> 03:24:17.553]  Jesse Ventura saying the 9-11, the government was probably behind it.
[03:24:17.553 --> 03:24:19.575]  Not just that it looks like an inside job.
[03:24:19.575 --> 03:24:21.978]  Now he's saying who did the job.
[03:24:21.978 --> 03:24:24.200]  That it's insurance fraud as part of it.
[03:24:25.202 --> 03:24:25.903]  This is huge.
[03:24:25.903 --> 03:24:28.305]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[03:24:28.305 --> 03:24:33.709]  We need your help getting the story out to everybody and all the developments that happened when he was on with us yesterday.
[03:24:33.709 --> 03:24:38.173]  Talking to State Senator Karen Johnson, what do you think is most important today in our world?
[03:24:38.173 --> 03:24:39.614]  What do you see happening in our future?
[03:24:39.614 --> 03:24:42.476]  Are you optimistic or what?
[03:24:42.476 --> 03:24:47.561]  Oh Alex, I wish I could be more optimistic.
[03:24:47.561 --> 03:24:53.185]  The more that I learn and the more that I read, I have to admit that it's pretty frustrating, but I just
[03:24:54.659 --> 03:25:08.024]  Thank God that we have people like yourself out there and many other great organizations that are trying to alert the people to the peril that we are in because we are losing our country.
[03:25:08.024 --> 03:25:22.249]  Well, perhaps it's pretty far gone, but there are things that we can do and the more people that we wake up and that we help become alert to what's happening around them, you know, the better chance we'll have of saving our country.
[03:25:25.049 --> 03:25:33.156]  What do you see happening on the horizon with the dollar plunging, our name destroyed, all three presidential candidates are the worst I've ever seen?
[03:25:33.156 --> 03:25:37.220]  Oh, I couldn't agree more about that.
[03:25:37.220 --> 03:25:42.285]  I, you know, I was very disappointed and yet I'm not sure if it was the American people.
[03:25:42.285 --> 03:25:51.413]  When we had a candidate like Ron Paul, a really, probably the best candidate we've had in decades, that's ever, well, perhaps ever.
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:26:05.974]  But he's out there, he's expressing his thoughts and views which are strictly and totally constitutional, and yet, you know, he gets 8, 10, maybe 15 percent, you know, out in the voting.
[03:26:05.974 --> 03:26:10.759]  But I'm not sure that the voting is being counted right.
[03:26:10.759 --> 03:26:15.264]  I'm thinking that we may be past having, you know, really accurate voting, Alex.
[03:26:17.688 --> 03:26:21.693]  Well, what else does the federal government not cheat in?
[03:26:21.693 --> 03:26:23.916]  These voting machine companies have all been caught red-handed.
[03:26:25.074 --> 03:26:26.995]  Yeah, it's pretty sad.
[03:26:26.995 --> 03:26:31.976]  Last year, oh my gosh, I ran a bill here in the Arizona State Legislature.
[03:26:31.976 --> 03:26:34.037]  It actually died at least nine times.
[03:26:34.037 --> 03:26:39.659]  I don't know how we ever got it through, and it was an absolute miracle that our Democrat governor signed it.
[03:26:39.659 --> 03:26:42.619]  And it was such a really small thing.
[03:26:42.619 --> 03:26:54.223]  We simply require a 2% hand count, you know, at the end of the day on random sampled precincts so that nobody knows ahead of time which ones are going to be counted.
[03:26:54.990 --> 03:27:01.393]  Uh, you know, and then we get into the, uh, the computer diff that's in the Dybels and the Sequoias.
[03:27:01.393 --> 03:27:06.555]  Anyway, it was such a little thing, but wow, did we have a lot of opposition to that.
[03:27:06.555 --> 03:27:09.856]  It was very difficult to even get that through.
[03:27:09.856 --> 03:27:10.657]  Well, it's simple.
[03:27:10.657 --> 03:27:13.078]  It's what the Founding Fathers told us.
[03:27:13.078 --> 03:27:14.978]  There's a lot of money involved in government.
[03:27:14.978 --> 03:27:19.280]  They always take over societies of their left or their own devices.
[03:27:19.280 --> 03:27:20.941]  They're always destructive and abusive.
[03:27:22.228 --> 03:27:30.394]  There are powerful, intelligent interests that want to use the mechanism of government to enslave and control.
[03:27:30.394 --> 03:27:34.838]  It's not an if, it's a guarantee that that's going to happen, and it's now happened again, Senator.
[03:27:36.132 --> 03:27:38.594]  Yes, no, I couldn't agree more.
[03:27:38.594 --> 03:27:56.330]  One of the things that was so disturbing here in Arizona is that our governor, Democrat Janet Napolitano, signed on this last fall with, of all people, Republican Homeland Security Director Chertoff to put Arizona into this pilot program
[03:27:57.070 --> 03:28:14.834]  For the national ID, not only will that cost the state some money, if in fact it were implemented, and we are in, we're over a $2 billion deficit, but we did run a bill this year to opt us out of the real ID, to say that Arizona's not going to have anything to do with it.
[03:28:14.834 --> 03:28:21.916]  And I was so proud of the governor from Montana, you know, who just told Mr. Chertoff where to go, where the sun doesn't shine.
[03:28:22.509 --> 03:28:30.196]  And hopefully, he will contact our governor and say, sign this bill, because it has passed both the House and the Senate.
[03:28:30.196 --> 03:28:33.078]  And we're waiting to see whether or not she's going to sign it.
[03:28:33.078 --> 03:28:44.768]  Well, the incredible thing is, they give all the illegals passes, they accept bank cards that the banks give them with no ID, and then they tell the public, oh, it's to stop the illegals, when the government gives them a free pass under the NAU.
[03:28:45.589 --> 03:28:52.014]  The fence is basically going to be used to keep us in, and then the illegals will just be legal to go and come as they will.
[03:28:52.014 --> 03:28:59.400]  So it's, you know, they're selling it to some conservatives as something to quote, stop illegal immigration.
[03:28:59.400 --> 03:29:01.762]  They could do that overnight by prosecuting employers.
[03:29:02.478 --> 03:29:12.826]  Yeah, they absolutely have really deluded some of the conservatives with that particular issue and it's been a real hard sell sometimes to turn them around.
[03:29:12.826 --> 03:29:15.808]  I've been appreciative of all entities.
[03:29:15.808 --> 03:29:26.456]  The ACLU has been extremely helpful in pushing this particular issue as well as helping me with one other issue and that was that we're not going to fingerprint our kids in school.
[03:29:27.276 --> 03:29:27.917]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:29:27.917 --> 03:29:29.379]  I want to hear about that when we get back.
[03:29:29.379 --> 03:29:34.906]  And your phone call, State Senator Karen Johnson, an amazing lady, speaking up for 9-11 Truth.
[03:29:34.906 --> 03:29:36.087]  Stay with us.
[03:29:36.087 --> 03:29:37.489]  We're on the march.
[03:29:37.489 --> 03:29:40.012]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:40.012 --> 03:29:42.696]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:47.352 --> 03:29:53.435]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[03:29:53.435 --> 03:29:59.377]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[03:29:59.377 --> 03:30:03.539]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[03:30:03.539 --> 03:30:08.441]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[03:30:08.701 --> 03:30:17.184]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.
[03:30:17.184 --> 03:30:27.447]  Instantly transform ordinary tap water into clean, living, energized water containing alkaline minerals, disease-fighting antioxidants, and highly absorbable oxygen.
[03:30:27.447 --> 03:30:32.268]  Now you can easily and effectively rid your body of harmful acidic waste with alkaline ionized water.
[03:30:32.668 --> 03:30:36.990]  Let SnyderHealth.com provide the water ionizer that's right for you and your family.
[03:30:36.990 --> 03:30:42.512]  Call us today at 877-356-2508 and visit us online at SnyderHealth.com.
[03:30:42.512 --> 03:30:46.213]  That's S-N-Y-D-E-R-Health.com.
[03:30:46.213 --> 03:30:47.634]  It is a big idea.
[03:30:47.634 --> 03:30:50.455]  A new world order.
[03:30:50.455 --> 03:30:55.337]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:30:55.337 --> 03:30:57.438]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:30:57.438 --> 03:31:00.319]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[03:31:00.967 --> 03:31:04.129]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:31:04.129 --> 03:31:14.497]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:31:14.497 --> 03:31:19.441]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:31:19.921 --> 03:31:23.203]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:31:23.203 --> 03:31:26.365]  The Overbearing is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:31:26.365 --> 03:31:27.526]  Most people have no idea.
[03:31:27.526 --> 03:31:28.326]  They're not after money.
[03:31:28.326 --> 03:31:29.587]  They have all the money they need.
[03:31:29.587 --> 03:31:30.568]  They're after power.
[03:31:30.568 --> 03:31:31.728]  That's what they're after these years.
[03:31:31.728 --> 03:31:36.471]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[03:31:36.471 --> 03:31:40.433]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:40.433 --> 03:31:43.255]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:31:43.255 --> 03:31:44.396]  You have been warned.
[03:31:45.168 --> 03:31:50.692]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[03:31:50.692 --> 03:31:55.715]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people.

[03:33:00.714 --> 03:33:04.915]  State Senator Karen Johnson's our guest.
[03:33:04.915 --> 03:33:07.216]  We'll fire up some of her websites and contact info.
[03:33:07.216 --> 03:33:08.476]  Just Google her name.
[03:33:08.476 --> 03:33:08.776]  Great lady.
[03:33:08.776 --> 03:33:12.157]  We're going to go to her in just one moment and then your calls.
[03:33:12.157 --> 03:33:16.478]  Before I go any further, remember we've got a money bomb coming up just like Ron Paul had.
[03:33:16.478 --> 03:33:17.318]  I didn't start this.
[03:33:17.318 --> 03:33:18.018]  I'm not doing it.
[03:33:18.018 --> 03:33:19.759]  But I'm not going to let it be a failure.
[03:33:19.759 --> 03:33:21.159]  And I hope you won't let it be either.
[03:33:21.159 --> 03:33:27.781]  I pledge 100% of the capital that comes in to this organization through this money bomb.
[03:33:27.781 --> 03:33:29.641]  100% will be spent on cameras, computers,
[03:33:30.619 --> 03:33:32.280]  Uh, staff, uh, bigger building.
[03:33:32.280 --> 03:33:35.282]  We're already moving to a bigger building, so it'll just help.
[03:33:35.282 --> 03:33:38.104]  And, uh, we'll go into the fight against the New World Order in a big way.
[03:33:38.104 --> 03:33:40.666]  A TV show, of course, on Dish Network or DirecTV.
[03:33:40.666 --> 03:33:41.646]  Maybe even a network.
[03:33:41.646 --> 03:33:42.767]  I was already planning that.
[03:33:42.767 --> 03:33:48.531]  It's just a lot of money might let us do it in four or five months instead of a year.
[03:33:48.531 --> 03:33:50.632]  Because, you know, we always do what we say we're gonna do.
[03:33:50.632 --> 03:33:51.333]  It just takes time.
[03:33:52.907 --> 03:33:59.751]  In amongst making films and websites and flying places and going to Bilderberg coming up in a few weeks.
[03:33:59.751 --> 03:34:01.533]  That costs money.
[03:34:01.533 --> 03:34:02.453]  And we're your reporters.
[03:34:02.453 --> 03:34:02.913]  We're out here.
[03:34:02.913 --> 03:34:03.694]  We need your support.
[03:34:03.694 --> 03:34:07.757]  So go sign up for Infowarsmoneybomb.com coming up on the 31st of this month.
[03:34:07.757 --> 03:34:12.860]  Also, our sponsors make it all possible, like eFoods Direct.

[03:34:20.470 --> 03:34:26.493]  They store in very small areas because each can, each container is jam-packed with dried food.
[03:34:26.493 --> 03:34:28.014]  And they've got it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:34:28.014 --> 03:34:30.015]  Get a free catalog, give them a call.
[03:34:30.015 --> 03:34:36.459]  They got boogie packs, two-month supplies, year supplies, and I've been getting food from them for eight, nine years.
[03:34:36.459 --> 03:34:38.020]  The food I first bought from them is still good.
[03:34:38.849 --> 03:34:40.352]  In all these uncertain times, give them a call.
[03:34:40.352 --> 03:34:40.432]  1-800-409-5633.
[03:34:40.432 --> 03:34:40.512]  1-800-409-5633.
[03:34:40.512 --> 03:34:43.196]  If there's a depression or anything, we're going to have food problems.
[03:34:43.196 --> 03:34:43.257]  1-800-409-5633.
[03:34:50.562 --> 03:34:52.384]  Uh, or eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:34:52.384 --> 03:34:57.267]  Big links at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com at the top of each page if you missed that.
[03:34:57.267 --> 03:35:01.410]  Uh, also, there's another great sponsor, Aloe Ease.
[03:35:01.410 --> 03:35:07.694]  And, uh, Aloe Ease is one of hundreds of well-documented, high-quality products from the folks at New Vitality.
[03:35:07.694 --> 03:35:10.917]  We have a big banner to them at InfoWars.com where you can link through.
[03:35:11.417 --> 03:35:13.620]  We're going to NewVitality.com.
[03:35:13.620 --> 03:35:23.134]  The Aloe Ease Body Cleanze, aloe vera's concentrate, is very well known to flush out toxins and really clean your guts out, and that's why I believe in it.
[03:35:23.718 --> 03:35:30.143]  And 1-800-569-4056, really good detox, very inexpensive, 1-800-569-4056.

[03:35:36.548 --> 03:35:49.058]  And last but not least is the fine folks with the best green food I found anywhere, innerfood.com, E-N-E-R, food.com.
[03:35:49.058 --> 03:35:50.559]  They have healthy coffees, healthy Cocos.
[03:35:51.471 --> 03:35:52.935]  A whole line of other great products.
[03:35:52.935 --> 03:35:58.890]  They're Patriots, and it's two little scoops each morning or evening in your juice or water, but it tastes good with juice.

[03:36:16.152 --> 03:36:16.453]  And again,
[03:36:23.699 --> 03:36:28.503]  It is our sponsors that make it all possible, and without you supporting them, we couldn't continue on.
[03:36:28.503 --> 03:36:30.024]  So thank you, everybody.
[03:36:30.024 --> 03:36:33.006]  Be sure and support our Aminathem affiliate local sponsors as well.
[03:36:33.006 --> 03:36:35.008]  I want to thank them.
[03:36:35.008 --> 03:36:42.213]  Senator Johnson, finishing up with thumb scanning to get school lunches, thumb scanning to get your library books, training you to be a prisoner.
[03:36:42.213 --> 03:36:43.414]  When did you find out about that?
[03:36:43.414 --> 03:36:44.715]  How did you block that in Arizona?
[03:36:46.174 --> 03:36:47.434]  Alex, thank you.
[03:36:47.434 --> 03:36:52.076]  Before I address that, I want to thank you for all of that great information.
[03:36:52.076 --> 03:36:55.497]  Boy, do we want to see you grow and get into a bigger building.
[03:36:55.497 --> 03:36:58.357]  We need you out there fighting this New World Order.
[03:36:58.357 --> 03:37:03.339]  And as far as getting your supply or food storage, wow!
[03:37:03.339 --> 03:37:04.819]  Everybody's got to be doing that.
[03:37:04.819 --> 03:37:06.379]  So, that's great information.
[03:37:06.379 --> 03:37:08.360]  Yeah, that makes you not dependent on Big Brother.
[03:37:09.040 --> 03:37:09.620]  Absolutely.
[03:37:09.620 --> 03:37:15.143]  Did you see the New York Times article where it said 44% national increase in local tattletale lines?
[03:37:15.143 --> 03:37:19.185]  They're tattling to get money to pay the rent or to get gas.
[03:37:19.185 --> 03:37:19.686]  I did.
[03:37:19.686 --> 03:37:21.487]  I saw that.
[03:37:21.487 --> 03:37:23.768]  What'd you think of it?
[03:37:23.768 --> 03:37:26.529]  I'm just going, holy cow, what is going on now?
[03:37:26.529 --> 03:37:29.010]  It's just getting crazier and crazier.
[03:37:29.010 --> 03:37:33.773]  Grandmothers turning their grandchildren in for 500 bucks for marijuana.
[03:37:33.773 --> 03:37:36.354]  Meanwhile, we know who ships in the real drugs.
[03:37:36.354 --> 03:37:36.494]  Yeah.
[03:37:38.599 --> 03:37:40.620]  Just absolutely incredible.
[03:37:40.620 --> 03:37:42.461]  My point is that's what they do.
[03:37:42.461 --> 03:37:46.703]  They'll shut the food off and say, turn your neighbor in for guns, and you get food.
[03:37:46.703 --> 03:37:48.063]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:37:48.063 --> 03:37:54.606]  And people are going to be in such dire straits because they haven't planned and they haven't prepared.
[03:37:54.606 --> 03:37:59.108]  And they're so ignorant that it's going to be pretty devastating.
[03:37:59.108 --> 03:38:00.769]  Well, it certainly is.
[03:38:00.769 --> 03:38:02.430]  So, I didn't even know about that.
[03:38:02.430 --> 03:38:04.070]  See, they don't tell us about victories.
[03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:07.232]  You guys ban at the state level the thumb scanners to get their lunches?
[03:38:08.411 --> 03:38:09.212]  Uh, yes.
[03:38:09.212 --> 03:38:19.500]  The bill, the actual bill that I ran says that it prohibits public schools from collecting biometric information from pupils unless the schools receive written parental permission.
[03:38:19.500 --> 03:38:21.621]  But we even took that out.
[03:38:21.621 --> 03:38:24.123]  I mean, it just can't be done.
[03:38:24.123 --> 03:38:26.285]  Well, you're really a heroine.
[03:38:26.285 --> 03:38:28.286]  You're a hero.
[03:38:28.286 --> 03:38:34.271]  Well, we got some good support, as I said, from the ACLU on this, so that was kind of interesting.
[03:38:35.040 --> 03:38:41.144]  Well, you see, ACLU's got, from my experience, I'd like to get your take on it, great members, and they mean well.
[03:38:41.144 --> 03:38:43.506]  But at the top, they create bad case law.
[03:38:43.506 --> 03:38:44.446]  At the top, they're controlled.
[03:38:44.446 --> 03:38:49.249]  Just like the NRA, we've proven in their own internal documents, is a gun control group.
[03:38:49.249 --> 03:38:51.831]  They always keep their friends close, their enemies closer.
[03:38:51.831 --> 03:38:58.595]  And so they're there, and so yeah, I'm sure you've got a good local chapter, and they bear some good fruit, but nothing like Karen Johnson.
[03:38:58.595 --> 03:38:59.476]  Everything you do is good.
[03:39:00.428 --> 03:39:08.494]  Well, you know, Alex, it's funny because here we had such great support, you know, on this opting out of the Real ID and the fingerprint.
[03:39:08.494 --> 03:39:14.739]  But then, let me tell you, I ran a bill this year that just about blew up the House and the Senate.
[03:39:14.739 --> 03:39:24.407]  It was in regards to concealed weapons, carrying them on your universities and college campuses, and the original bill allowed
[03:39:25.467 --> 03:39:32.789]  Anybody to carry on to any campuses, even, you know, grade schools and junior high and high schools.
[03:39:32.789 --> 03:39:38.470]  We're talking about now adults that are valid concealed weapon carry permit holders.
[03:39:38.470 --> 03:39:43.591]  We're not talking about kids carrying guns, which some people got a little mixed up about.
[03:39:43.591 --> 03:39:49.032]  But this thing just blew the lid off of what was going on down here.
[03:39:49.032 --> 03:39:50.732]  I mean, talk about controversy.
[03:39:51.616 --> 03:40:00.785]  Yeah, you send your children to a place where it's been advertised in the national media that psychos are supposed to go, who are always on Prozac-type drugs, Prozac class.
[03:40:00.785 --> 03:40:01.926]  It's advertised.
[03:40:01.926 --> 03:40:06.110]  What do I do when I'm depressed and psycho and get out of some government mind-control facility?
[03:40:06.110 --> 03:40:10.995]  I go up and shoot schools up, and then we send our children to a place where no one's allowed to protect them.
[03:40:11.912 --> 03:40:12.653]  Exactly.
[03:40:12.653 --> 03:40:24.340]  You know, I've got this poster in my office that a lot of people got a kick out of because it has a picture of a gun, you know, a handgun, with the line through it and it says, attention criminals, gun-free zone.
[03:40:24.340 --> 03:40:31.384]  All law-abiding faculty, staff, and students of this institution have been disarmed for your convenience.
[03:40:31.384 --> 03:40:32.144]  Absolutely.
[03:40:32.144 --> 03:40:33.165]  We're wonderful.
[03:40:33.165 --> 03:40:36.247]  We should all put out posters like that and hang them everywhere.
[03:40:36.247 --> 03:40:37.908]  Now look, I said people can disagree.
[03:40:37.908 --> 03:40:40.529]  This guy calls about once a week and
[03:40:42.122 --> 03:40:44.142]  And I'm not going to spend a long time with him.
[03:40:44.142 --> 03:40:45.343]  He always says the same stuff.
[03:40:45.343 --> 03:40:48.503]  It's like pulling a string on one of those dolls.
[03:40:48.503 --> 03:40:50.864]  But we'll go to Justin first, then we'll go to everybody else.
[03:40:50.864 --> 03:40:52.684]  Justin, in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:40:52.684 --> 03:40:53.124]  Hi, yes.
[03:40:53.124 --> 03:40:55.065]  I was just calling to disagree, of course.
[03:40:55.065 --> 03:41:10.128]  And I just wanted to tell Senator Karen Johnson that maybe the reason that she's not convinced with the original story of 9-11 is because she's influenced by intellectually bankrupt movies like Loose Change, which don't tell the complete facts.
[03:41:10.128 --> 03:41:11.848]  They quote mind firefighters.
[03:41:12.561 --> 03:41:14.142]  And it's just completely untrue.
[03:41:14.142 --> 03:41:20.965]  Okay, thank you for the call, and everything you said is disinfo and not true, and you're not going to stop us exposing the government-sponsored terror.
[03:41:20.965 --> 03:41:29.850]  Let me tell you something, these debunking sites, one of them goes, oh my gosh, I'm in the army, I am having to get a chip that tracks me, but I guess they're still kooks.
[03:41:29.850 --> 03:41:40.175]  It didn't exist, but now it does, and you're a hero to take your chip, and that very guy you just heard, or someone claiming to be him, went and posted on there and said, oh, you're a hero, it's good to take chips for your government.
[03:41:41.375 --> 03:41:43.837]  And they'll say Northwoods isn't real.
[03:41:43.837 --> 03:41:46.918]  They'll say Gulf of Tonkin wasn't staged.
[03:41:46.918 --> 03:41:53.301]  It doesn't matter if the Chicago Tribune admits, the NSA admits that USS Liberty was attacked, to be sunk, to blame it on Egypt.
[03:41:53.301 --> 03:41:56.503]  That Israel did know it was an American ship.
[03:41:56.503 --> 03:41:58.344]  They'll just say it's not true.
[03:41:58.344 --> 03:42:01.105]  Karen, that must be pretty easy when you just deny reality.
[03:42:02.154 --> 03:42:13.718]  Well, you know, Alex, my resources for my feelings on 9-11 come from, you know, Richard Gage from Architects and Engineers for Truth.
[03:42:13.718 --> 03:42:18.100]  I think their website is AE911Truth.
[03:42:18.100 --> 03:42:25.422]  And they've now published, not just in their own published scientific groups, but in prestigious publications.
[03:42:25.422 --> 03:42:26.443]  Peer-reviewed!
[03:42:26.443 --> 03:42:27.143]  That's right!
[03:42:27.143 --> 03:42:29.144]  It's over for you, terrorist!
[03:42:29.144 --> 03:42:29.464]  Okay?
[03:42:30.367 --> 03:42:34.049]  And then, you know, I personally know Dr. Stephen Jones.
[03:42:34.049 --> 03:42:39.032]  I've been to three different conferences where we've been able to sit and discuss a lot of this.
[03:42:39.032 --> 03:42:46.357]  And then David Ray Griffin was here not too long ago in Phoenix and I had the privilege of listening to him and getting some of his information.
[03:42:46.357 --> 03:42:49.359]  I think these people are pretty doggone credible people.
[03:42:49.359 --> 03:42:49.779]  They are.
[03:42:49.779 --> 03:42:54.201]  Let's talk to, who's up next here?
[03:42:54.201 --> 03:42:56.643]  Maury in Arizona, you're on the air with Senator Karen Johnson.
[03:42:58.467 --> 03:43:00.271]  Karen Johnson for Governor, yay!
[03:43:00.271 --> 03:43:09.467]  Senator, I wanted to ask you, do you support submission to federal jurisdiction and destruction of the state sovereignty for Arizona?
[03:43:12.246 --> 03:43:13.987]  I support states' rights.
[03:43:13.987 --> 03:43:22.313]  Yes, she introduced a bill in, what, 99 when Clinton was getting ready for martial law for the state to secede if they confiscated guns or declared a new world order.
[03:43:22.313 --> 03:43:24.875]  Why don't you tell them about that?
[03:43:24.875 --> 03:43:29.119]  I'm talking about the English Language Learning Act.
[03:43:29.119 --> 03:43:31.280]  Federal Judge Collins.
[03:43:31.280 --> 03:43:34.723]  I called him up and asked him why he issued an illegal order.
[03:43:35.413 --> 03:43:47.583]  And he said because the state of Arizona in the year 2000 submitted to federal jurisdiction and surrendered the state sovereignty, and it was Governor Janet Napolitano who signed the government contract.
[03:43:47.583 --> 03:43:49.544]  Well let me just say this, that's what Homeland Security is.
[03:43:49.544 --> 03:43:56.450]  They're federalizing schools, they're federalizing firemen, giving them guns, having them spy on you, ruining our wonderful firemen.
[03:43:56.450 --> 03:44:00.173]  I mean it's just a disease of federal scum, Senator.
[03:44:01.129 --> 03:44:19.006]  Well, I can tell you that it's been extremely frustrating and disturbing to me that our legislators here in Arizona, many of them, including our leadership, have acquiesced to the federal government time and time again when there have been a group of us here in the legislature that have said,
[03:44:20.387 --> 03:44:20.927]  Stop!
[03:44:20.927 --> 03:44:30.531]  We need to assert our state's rights, but they would not do it, and we didn't have enough legislators that would stand with us, you know, to go against the courts and the federal government.
[03:44:30.531 --> 03:44:34.933]  And that's because they want to move up the crime syndicate ladder to the international and federal level.
[03:44:34.933 --> 03:44:36.853]  I think you're right.
[03:44:36.853 --> 03:44:46.717]  And, well, please elaborate, if you'd like to elaborate on that, if you agree, Senator, but the bigger problem here is that the feds take a dollar of our money on average and give us 33 cents back on average.
[03:44:46.717 --> 03:44:48.838]  These idiots think that it's free money.
[03:44:48.838 --> 03:44:49.058]  Senator?
[03:44:50.963 --> 03:44:59.886]  We've been trying to get our state to hold on to all of our transportation taxes here, because we're one of those donor states.
[03:44:59.886 --> 03:45:04.148]  And we've said, hey, look, let's hold all of our transportation taxes.
[03:45:04.148 --> 03:45:06.709]  Let's spend the money on what we need to spend on.
[03:45:06.709 --> 03:45:10.010]  If there's anything left, then maybe we'll send it on to the federal government.
[03:45:10.010 --> 03:45:14.331]  If not, we need to do what we need to do here with it.
[03:45:14.331 --> 03:45:17.132]  Yes, why give them money to hire more shaved head
[03:45:18.012 --> 03:45:18.172]  Hello?
[03:45:35.305 --> 03:45:36.025]  Yes, sir.
[03:45:36.025 --> 03:45:37.366]  Oh, is this Alex?
[03:45:37.366 --> 03:45:37.907]  Yes, sir.
[03:45:37.907 --> 03:45:38.307]  You're on the air.
[03:45:38.307 --> 03:45:38.927]  Thank you, sir.
[03:45:38.927 --> 03:45:42.249]  I've been a longtime listener of yours from the beginning.
[03:45:42.249 --> 03:45:42.669]  We are friends.
[03:45:42.669 --> 03:45:43.970]  We're all a family.
[03:45:43.970 --> 03:45:48.853]  And I have all your videos, and I wanted to let you and the Senator know, she mentioned meetups.
[03:45:48.853 --> 03:45:54.877]  I've been a member of a meetup that meets in Cambridge on Sundays, and it's kind of a strange name.
[03:45:54.877 --> 03:46:01.721]  They call it the Conspiracy Cafe, but it basically deals with 9-11 truth, the truth about everything, you know, not just 9-11.
[03:46:04.882 --> 03:46:06.464]  You know, I'm very, very tired.
[03:46:06.464 --> 03:46:09.887]  I woke up during the 60s when I was in Vietnam.
[03:46:09.887 --> 03:46:13.631]  That's when I became aware of what the world's really about.
[03:46:13.631 --> 03:46:15.713]  I looked behind the curtain.
[03:46:15.713 --> 03:46:25.682]  And what's frustrating is 99 out of 100 people I talk to, you try to reason with them about 9-11, the New World Order, the Bilderbergers, the Rothschilds.
[03:46:29.912 --> 03:46:35.738]  People look at me like I belong in a mental institution, and they'll say, that's all urban folklore.
[03:46:35.738 --> 03:46:39.321]  Oh yeah, they say Bilderberg doesn't exist, CFR doesn't exist.
[03:46:39.321 --> 03:46:44.606]  Like, I mentioned... Listen, Bilderberg's having its meeting in the U.S.
[03:46:44.606 --> 03:46:46.668]  I heard that on your show yesterday.
[03:46:46.668 --> 03:46:53.975]  They used to normally have it in Europe, and they're doing it because we have a more blacked-out media, and we have police that'll go after citizens.
[03:46:53.975 --> 03:46:55.116]  Senator Johnson comments?
[03:46:55.970 --> 03:47:00.271]  Well, they need to have a subscription to American Free Press.
[03:47:00.271 --> 03:47:06.453]  I mean, my gosh, they expose, you know, Michael Collins Piper writes about the Bilderbergers all the time.
[03:47:06.453 --> 03:47:08.494]  I mean, he does great work.
[03:47:08.494 --> 03:47:09.794]  You do great work.
[03:47:09.794 --> 03:47:15.216]  There is information all over that is extremely accurate and documented about this group.
[03:47:15.216 --> 03:47:15.876]  Absolutely.
[03:47:15.876 --> 03:47:17.477]  Anything else, Arthur?
[03:47:17.477 --> 03:47:20.798]  You know, it's like the NAU, the Amero.
[03:47:21.721 --> 03:47:24.103]  Everyone I talk to, they say, where are you getting your information?
[03:47:24.103 --> 03:47:30.106]  I point them, you know, to the web, or I brought up the topic of eugenics.
[03:47:30.106 --> 03:47:31.827]  That's make-believe, it's not real.
[03:47:31.827 --> 03:47:37.270]  And then, when I point them somewhere on the web, they'll say, well, the web's all make-believe, and it's run by wackos.
[03:47:37.270 --> 03:47:38.331]  And if you point them at U.S.
[03:47:38.331 --> 03:47:40.913]  Government documents, Library of Congress, they say, that doesn't exist.
[03:47:40.913 --> 03:47:43.414]  Actually, I've sent some of them to the PNAC site.
[03:47:43.414 --> 03:47:46.356]  If you want to hear it from the horse's rear end, you know, go to PNAC.
[03:47:46.952 --> 03:47:49.314]  Well, how do we know that's not a real... that's not a fake?
[03:47:49.314 --> 03:47:53.177]  Well, look, they're living in denial, and they're gonna... I mean, look, I appreciate your call.
[03:47:53.177 --> 03:47:56.599]  I've got people telling me the dollar hasn't been devalued, and I'm a liar.
[03:47:56.599 --> 03:48:00.542]  And then they go on the message boards and say I'm Al-Qaeda, trying to lie to them.
[03:48:00.542 --> 03:48:03.865]  The government's all, I'm not kidding, they say that I'm working for Al-Qaeda.
[03:48:03.865 --> 03:48:08.008]  Well, the White House has said that 9-11 Truth works for Ahmadinejad, Senator.
[03:48:08.852 --> 03:48:12.873]  Oh, Alex, you know what I do in answer to this gentleman?
[03:48:12.873 --> 03:48:18.955]  When I start talking to people, if they think I'm out, whacked out, and kooky, I move on.
[03:48:18.955 --> 03:48:21.376]  I find people that are open and receptive.
[03:48:21.376 --> 03:48:21.876]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:48:21.876 --> 03:48:25.017]  I mean, the type of people that don't know we're in big trouble.
[03:48:25.017 --> 03:48:30.399]  I mean, if anybody can't smell the stench of corruption, there's some... Senator, go ahead and make your point.
[03:48:30.399 --> 03:48:30.719]  I'm sorry.
[03:48:31.719 --> 03:48:35.203]  No, no, you made the point.
[03:48:35.203 --> 03:48:40.028]  Going back to the issue of states' rights here, we've got another issue.
[03:48:40.028 --> 03:48:44.672]  Oh my gosh, Alex, this is one that has just been huge here in Arizona.
[03:48:44.672 --> 03:48:50.958]  We have the federal government coming in to our federal parks here, if you would.
[03:48:51.827 --> 03:48:52.628]  I don't think so.
[03:49:11.963 --> 03:49:17.067]  They belong to the people here in the state of Arizona and the people of the United States.
[03:49:17.067 --> 03:49:19.789]  And we have run a bill to say, stop.
[03:49:19.789 --> 03:49:22.031]  You are not going to do that anymore in Arizona.
[03:49:22.031 --> 03:49:27.555]  We're opening these roads up and they're going to stay so people can get back in there for camping, for hiking.
[03:49:27.555 --> 03:49:29.516]  They can take their ATVs.
[03:49:29.516 --> 03:49:33.219]  They can do what they want back in there, you know, without destroying the environment.
[03:49:34.199 --> 03:49:42.201]  But we've got to do this, and for the federal government to come in and just arbitrarily start closing down these roads and locking us out.
[03:49:42.201 --> 03:49:45.602]  It's all about power, all about control, absolute trash.
[03:49:45.602 --> 03:49:48.883]  Chris in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:49:48.883 --> 03:49:50.443]  Hi, Alex.
[03:49:50.443 --> 03:49:55.444]  I just wanted to applaud the Senator for coming forward and being so open-minded.
[03:49:55.444 --> 03:49:58.065]  The second thing, I wanted to ask two things.
[03:49:58.065 --> 03:50:01.586]  One, are there other American legislators that are
[03:50:02.774 --> 03:50:03.815]  Yeah, that's all the plan.
[03:50:25.211 --> 03:50:26.371]  Control!
[03:50:26.371 --> 03:50:27.332]  Control!
[03:50:27.332 --> 03:50:28.852]  Yeah, stay there.
[03:50:28.852 --> 03:50:34.334]  Senator, final segment, we're going to talk to a few final callers, but I want to get your take on why they did it.
[03:50:34.334 --> 03:50:35.314]  No-bid contracts.
[03:50:35.314 --> 03:50:37.835]  Hundreds of billions a year in no-bid contracts.
[03:50:37.835 --> 03:50:40.876]  Grabbing land, grabbing oil, domestic police state.
[03:50:40.876 --> 03:50:41.737]  They did it for Israel.
[03:50:41.737 --> 03:50:46.458]  They did it for a lot of things.
[03:50:46.458 --> 03:50:48.939]  It is a big idea.
[03:50:48.939 --> 03:50:50.700]  A new world order.
[03:50:50.700 --> 03:50:51.620]  In the near future.
[03:50:52.518 --> 03:50:55.560]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:50:55.560 --> 03:50:58.401]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:50:58.401 --> 03:51:01.182]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:51:01.182 --> 03:51:04.384]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:51:04.384 --> 03:51:11.688]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:51:14.732 --> 03:51:20.177]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:51:20.177 --> 03:51:23.479]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:51:23.479 --> 03:51:26.602]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:51:26.602 --> 03:51:27.783]  Most people have no idea.
[03:51:27.783 --> 03:51:28.564]  They're not after money.
[03:51:28.564 --> 03:51:29.825]  They have all the money they need.
[03:51:29.825 --> 03:51:30.445]  They're after power.
[03:51:30.445 --> 03:51:31.966]  That's what they're after these years.

[03:51:40.693 --> 03:51:41.434]  Endgame.
[03:51:41.434 --> 03:51:43.495]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:51:43.495 --> 03:51:45.517]  You have been warned.
[03:51:45.517 --> 03:51:47.098]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[03:51:47.098 --> 03:51:50.781]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[03:51:50.781 --> 03:51:56.825]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[03:51:56.825 --> 03:52:00.908]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[03:52:00.908 --> 03:52:04.291]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom.
[03:52:04.491 --> 03:52:05.651]  Liberty of conscience.
[03:52:05.651 --> 03:52:10.312]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[03:52:10.312 --> 03:52:14.353]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[03:52:14.353 --> 03:52:16.974]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[03:52:16.974 --> 03:52:22.275]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[03:52:22.275 --> 03:52:25.936]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[03:52:25.936 --> 03:52:28.517]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[03:52:28.717 --> 03:52:31.500]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[03:52:31.500 --> 03:52:33.422]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling!
[03:52:33.422 --> 03:52:35.003]  Jesus is coming soon!

[03:52:45.140 --> 03:52:49.662]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[03:52:49.662 --> 03:52:54.764]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:52:54.764 --> 03:52:56.265]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[03:52:56.265 --> 03:52:59.866]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[03:54:01.266 --> 03:54:06.689]  It starts in just a few minutes at InfoWars.com.
[03:54:06.689 --> 03:54:15.292]  I'm begging you listeners to go to InfoWars.com where the top three stories about Jesse Ventura saying they blew up the towers for an insurance scam.
[03:54:15.292 --> 03:54:16.333]  He thinks the government did it.
[03:54:16.972 --> 03:54:18.133]  He's gone even further.
[03:54:18.133 --> 03:54:19.956]  His interview here yesterday.
[03:54:19.956 --> 03:54:20.917]  This is big news.
[03:54:20.917 --> 03:54:24.501]  And this will not punch out in the Associated Press and then hundreds of papers.
[03:54:24.501 --> 03:54:26.603]  And they get everybody talking around the water coolers.
[03:54:26.603 --> 03:54:28.665]  It just grows every minute.

[03:54:43.214 --> 03:54:44.734]  They'll take the bait and attack Jesse.
[03:54:44.734 --> 03:54:46.874]  People will find out about it.
[03:54:46.874 --> 03:54:49.555]  Send these articles to your whole, you know, email list.
[03:54:49.555 --> 03:54:50.715]  We need your help.
[03:54:50.715 --> 03:55:01.657]  Senator Johnson, what's your take on, you know, using the celebrity-obsessed culture, plus he's a former governor, now that he's really gone public on this show yesterday, on Stern today, to really get this out?
[03:55:01.657 --> 03:55:02.497]  Do you think that's important?
[03:55:03.488 --> 03:55:06.311]  Oh my gosh, absolutely Alex.
[03:55:06.311 --> 03:55:18.541]  You know, you kind of ask why, you know, why these things happened and I guess that's one of the big questions and why we want to see an investigation because, you know, we need to know who benefited.
[03:55:18.541 --> 03:55:20.263]  That's what I'm looking at.
[03:55:20.263 --> 03:55:27.870]  If you follow the money, we've spent over three trillion dollars now on a war in Iraq that had nothing to do with 9-11.
[03:55:27.870 --> 03:55:29.351]  That a handful of groups get.
[03:55:30.211 --> 03:55:31.172]  Right, right!
[03:55:31.172 --> 03:55:37.698]  Oh my gosh, a handful of corporations like Blackwater and Halliburton and Brown and Root and on and on.
[03:55:37.698 --> 03:55:49.189]  And then you've got, we've got the Patriot Act, we've got Homeland Security, we've got now the Real ID, we lost our habeas corpus, you know, we've got illegal wiretapping.
[03:55:49.189 --> 03:55:54.133]  These are all things that I don't think could have been pushed on the American people without 9-11.
[03:55:56.144 --> 03:56:01.930]  I agree, and now the crooks know that we're on to them, so they already have their police state set up in case we try to remove them.
[03:56:01.930 --> 03:56:04.232]  They've got their electronic voting machines going in.
[03:56:04.232 --> 03:56:10.878]  A perfect storm of evil, but the people are waking up like never before, and the globalists themselves say they're scared.
[03:56:10.878 --> 03:56:14.121]  So now is the time for courage to speak up, not to cower.
[03:56:14.121 --> 03:56:17.985]  Some people are on the air saying, be quiet, don't tell anyone you're against the new world order, they'll get you.
[03:56:17.985 --> 03:56:20.207]  No, if we cower, then they win.
[03:56:20.207 --> 03:56:21.248]  Senator, comments on that?
[03:56:22.219 --> 03:56:34.271]  Well, you're absolutely right and I, oh, Alex, I appreciate you so much and what you are doing and have been doing for a long time now and for others that are willing to stand up and to speak out.
[03:56:34.271 --> 03:56:35.412]  I mean, we've got to do it!
[03:56:36.522 --> 03:56:43.906]  Well, you were awake a long time before I was, but you said that one of the reasons you passed that law against the whole New World Order deal in your state, or tried to, about getting the U.N.
[03:56:43.906 --> 03:56:51.351]  out, was because you saw some of my films, and you know, then you help wake up other people, I wake up people, you woke up folks that probably woke me up.
[03:56:51.351 --> 03:57:00.756]  I mean, it's all symbiotic, and we're together on this, so I don't want any of the listeners to think that their talking to their neighbors and friends doesn't have an effect.
[03:57:01.759 --> 03:57:02.839]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:57:02.839 --> 03:57:03.660]  Absolutely.
[03:57:03.660 --> 03:57:09.841]  We are setting up little groups, and it's just like here in Arizona, you know, we have these meet-up groups.
[03:57:09.841 --> 03:57:18.424]  And you know, and if people want to help with this 9-11 issue, they can donate money to this cause if they can't get out and participate more, you know, on a personal level.
[03:57:18.544 --> 03:57:24.045]  And I want to be clear, folks, if we don't expose government-sponsored terror and turn it back now, they're going all the way.
[03:57:24.045 --> 03:57:26.226]  This isn't just going to be some banana republic tyranny.
[03:57:26.226 --> 03:57:27.886]  This is a scientific one.
[03:57:27.886 --> 03:57:29.827]  These are very cold-blooded people.
[03:57:29.827 --> 03:57:33.147]  Senator Johnson, I want to thank you for all the time you spent with us.
[03:57:33.147 --> 03:57:36.768]  Do you want to fire out your senatorial website?
[03:57:36.768 --> 03:57:39.209]  Uh, gee, I don't even know what it is.
[03:57:39.209 --> 03:57:42.510]  You just typed Terren Johnson into Google.
[03:57:42.510 --> 03:57:46.731]  Yeah, the website is just A-Z-L-E-G dot gov.
[03:57:46.731 --> 03:57:47.771]  Anything else you want to plug?
[03:57:49.741 --> 03:57:52.023]  No, just, I want people to get involved.
[03:57:52.023 --> 03:57:54.885]  And I want them to belong to these meet-up groups.
[03:57:54.885 --> 03:58:02.531]  And, you know, go in to send some money to the architects and engineers at 911truth.com.
[03:58:02.531 --> 03:58:07.475]  I mean, they need money to continue the push to get an independent investigation.
[03:58:07.475 --> 03:58:08.335]  Absolutely.
[03:58:08.335 --> 03:58:09.696]  Our lives depend on it.
[03:58:09.696 --> 03:58:10.397]  Take care, Senator.
[03:58:11.946 --> 03:58:13.368]  Folks, thank you.
