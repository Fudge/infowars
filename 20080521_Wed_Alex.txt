[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:38.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us. It is the 21st day of May
[00:38.000 --> 00:47.000]  2008. We're going to be live here for the next four hours, then over the web at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, as well as infowars.net,
[00:47.000 --> 00:58.000]  Jonesreport.com and truthinage.us. We will re-stream the show back to back until the next live transmission. Government may have a massive surveillance program for use in
[00:58.000 --> 01:10.000]  national emergency. 8 million potential suspects to be rounded up and taken to FEMA camps. And this has come out in government documents. We already knew this, but here it is back in the news. We'll go over it.
[01:10.000 --> 01:27.000]  Also, supply concerns puts oil above $130 for the first time. And Goldman Sachs, again, is coming out, as well as JPMorgan Chase, is saying they see $200 a barrel of oil, as we told you they would do two years ago.
[01:27.000 --> 01:40.000]  You like the New World Order? Well, get ready to really like them. And all those police that are militarized, dressed like ringwraiths, that's if you get out of line on your journey to slavery.
[01:40.000 --> 01:51.000]  House passes bill to sue OPEC over oil prices, as if OPEC has anything real to do with it. OPEC, of course, has nothing to do with the dollar being devalued.
[01:51.000 --> 02:06.000]  But, you know, the slave population can't even figure that out. Ventura attacks media for criticizing his free speech. Another big story, going out in the next hour or so at prisonplanet.com by Paul Watson detailing some other facets.
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  But this story by Kurt Nemo up on M4 Wars, you can get it out to everybody right now. Make sure the mainstream media bites on this again so we can have even more people look into 9-11 Truth.
[02:14.000 --> 02:22.000]  And so other celebrities and government officials, public servants have the courage to go public. Ventura attacks media for criticizing free speech.
[02:22.000 --> 02:29.000]  Attack were simply asking questions. And I'm told he was on Stern's show today and they attacked him. He just said, look, I'm a demolition expert. They blew it up.
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  The one question I meant to ask him, I dropped the ball was, okay, who do you think blew it up? And obviously he's implying the government.
[02:35.000 --> 02:41.000]  He said, oh, they staged Gulf of Tonkin and other events. But why did they blow it up? Because it'd be good to have him say that.
[02:41.000 --> 02:52.000]  But you can't be perfect, can you? Kennedy being released from hospital, returning to Cape Cod, Senator Edward Kennedy, they say has a brain tumor, which is almost 100% terminal.
[02:52.000 --> 03:03.000]  And it's the common brain tumor, once very rare, associated with 10 years or more of use of cell phone use. It's on the side of the lobe where he used his cell phone.
[03:03.000 --> 03:14.000]  And hey, didn't care about letting those go in the market, did you? Went ahead and went along with it? Well, it's all right. We all die, don't we? All part of drinking from the same black cup of death.
[03:14.000 --> 03:23.000]  Again, Goldman Sachs Oracle of Oils is $200 a barrel oil. Attack on Iran trashed the Constitution. Ray McGovern, I want to get him on soon again.
[03:23.000 --> 03:33.000]  General Dynamics or Bilderberg Group. It is the Bilderberg Group that has reportedly going to be in Chantilly, Virginia, right outside D.C.
[03:33.000 --> 03:41.000]  That is confirmed by Jim Tucker now. It was a ruse that they were in Greece. I thought that was the case. Didn't want to be mean to our guest who was saying that.
[03:41.000 --> 03:56.000]  June 6th through 8th. And a caller, they made a call to General Dynamics and confirmed that they've rented it out. So I guess they're the front company to do that.
[03:56.000 --> 04:11.000]  And Jim Tucker, we have a detailed report up on prisonplanet.com. Broke here yesterday that Jim Tucker has triple confirmed through his source in Bilderberg, through the Dutch embassy, and through other sources, well, really four sources, three individual sources,
[04:11.000 --> 04:24.000]  and separately calling the hotel. They are booked out for that space. So he says he is 100% confirmed on that. Bilderberg confirmed Westfield's Marriott Chantilly, Virginia, June 5th through 8th.
[04:24.000 --> 04:35.000]  And I'm tentatively saying in the next two days I'm going to book passage. And yes, I'm going to go there. I will take no pleasure in being in the proximity of such evil, but it's my job. I've got to do it.
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  It is my duty. And I'll be taking some of the boys with me.
[04:41.000 --> 04:54.000]  All right, we'll be right back after this quick break to plunge in all the vital news. Also tell you about the big guests we've got lined up for you today. Stay with me.
[04:54.000 --> 05:12.000]  Imagine a firefly, simple and innocent, the ability to light the night sky, the ozone layer unseen by the naked eye, life sustaining, our ocean, primordial soup breathes life, bringing the wonders of nature home.
[05:12.000 --> 05:29.000]  Soleil salt lamps, hand-crafted from million-year-old crystal salt, will gently ionize and purify your indoor air, helping you breathe easier, nourish your mind and body with soothing colors for deep relaxation, and neutralize EMF radiation, protecting your family's health.

[05:54.000 --> 05:59.000]  It is a big idea. A New World Order.
[05:59.000 --> 06:04.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[06:04.000 --> 06:09.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group. Could their objective be world domination?
[06:09.000 --> 06:20.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[06:20.000 --> 06:31.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their affidavit.
[06:39.000 --> 06:53.000]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv. In-game, blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[07:11.000 --> 07:20.000]  Here's the story. New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[07:20.000 --> 07:29.000]  And here's the best part. It's 100% legal. And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[07:34.000 --> 07:43.000]  Best of all, you can be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less. It's that simple. Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[07:43.000 --> 08:08.000]  That's www.orderfreetv.com. To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[08:08.000 --> 08:23.000]  Those who don't know, let me give you the heads up. The federal government is completely signed over now to private foreign corporations who have their own private intelligence agencies, their own mercenary forces.
[08:23.000 --> 08:31.000]  They have fully dismantled the Bill of Rights and Constitution even by legislation, which is null and void and a fraud.
[08:31.000 --> 08:45.000]  They are engaging in every form of crime imaginable on its face. They are arrogantly carrying out eugenics programs of sterilization and murder against the entire population.
[08:45.000 --> 08:53.000]  All of us are being sprayed poisoned. The water is being poisoned. The vaccines have bio weapons in them. This is all documented.
[08:53.000 --> 09:10.000]  We are under red level attack at every level. There is a false reality of TV and sports and super models and the general public thinking everything is fine, kind of running forward in this controlled paradigm of the corporate controlled media.
[09:10.000 --> 09:23.000]  The SWAT teams are putting how many people they have killed on the sides of their tanks like kills from World War II on the side of a P-38 lightning or P-38 Mustang, I guess you'd say.
[09:23.000 --> 09:33.000]  It's just all insane and to really face reality and see what it is and understand that they are just building hundreds of new prisons every year.
[09:33.000 --> 09:45.000]  We have more people in prison than any other country in the world. I've got reports, mainstream reports where a student falls asleep at their desk because their mother went to the hospital the night before.
[09:45.000 --> 09:56.000]  And the policeman comes in, slams them up against the wall, puts them in handcuffs and says, it's disorderly conduct and then they're put on probation as criminals for falling asleep at their desk.
[09:56.000 --> 10:11.000]  Right here in Austin for 10 years, anyone with more than three late tardies is fraudulently, there's not even a law, we expose this, sent to the principal, then the police handcuffed them, scared them, then give them a ticket.
[10:11.000 --> 10:21.000]  They then have special courts in all the elementary schools in Austin where it's all color of law. They threaten the parents to sign documents, signing the elementary student over to them.
[10:21.000 --> 10:33.000]  I mean, it's just, it's just hell on earth. It's just 10 years in prison for speeding, weeks in jail for no seatbelt.
[10:33.000 --> 10:45.000]  If you even talk back, they tase you, beat you, and then out of hand, it is policy to then charge you with resisting and assault with their own squad car video where you don't even touch them or they'll bump up against you.
[10:45.000 --> 10:57.000]  I mean, just reckless, total evil everywhere, spreading at maximum speed. Just, just every instinct I've got is to evacuate this country.
[10:57.000 --> 11:06.000]  I have to every day look at my children and decide that I'm putting liberty and freedom and defense of the republic ahead of them.
[11:06.000 --> 11:15.000]  Oh yeah, I'd be fleeing to a third world country right now, ladies and gentlemen, even though they're bad, it's not scientific like it is here and it'll come there later.
[11:15.000 --> 11:24.000]  I have to every day put down my paternal and maternal instincts for my beautiful, wonderful, angelic children.
[11:24.000 --> 11:40.000]  I have to every day control my animal instincts, but then they also just re-express themselves through abject rage and disgust.
[11:40.000 --> 11:53.000]  God help us. They're going to turn millions of Iraqi vets who've tortured, murdered, and killed and run checkpoints and violated rights and taking people to camps loose on us. God help us. I mean, I'll never forget. I'll never forget. It's in police state 2000.
[11:53.000 --> 12:05.000]  I was watching some clips of that this morning. Amazed I made this film in 1998, 1999, took me a year. Amazed that I edited it, voiced it to all myself.
[12:05.000 --> 12:22.000]  There were two other camera guys that shot video and I watched it 30 minutes up this morning at about 7am and I was just blown away that the music myself and my buddy Lance made on guitar for it.
[12:22.000 --> 12:37.000]  I'm not even going to a guitar player. You can hear the music I made for it. It sounds really evil. I was trying to show people how evil it was with the Marines training to put Americans in camps, take our guns, put us on our knees, blow our heads off.
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  God, why did it have to happen? Why was the elite so evil?
[12:41.000 --> 12:52.000]  You know, the globalists with their mid-level minions think they're all a bunch of new ageers and it's all about the great age of Aquarius and love and light and the great work and the worshipful masters, the Masonic order.
[12:52.000 --> 13:00.000]  And really, this morning, it really is the Masons. You know, people can talk about it's the Vatican, it's the Zionists, it's the vistas of that.
[13:00.000 --> 13:12.000]  Everything, you can say there's predominantly certain racial or religious groups that dominate sectors of the New Old Order, but at the end of it, they are Masons. They are mystery school, mystery religion.
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  That's why the all-seeing eye, the symbols, the signs.
[13:17.000 --> 13:29.000]  And then this morning, I was reading over again the oath of the different degrees of Masons, the third degree of Master Mason and so on at the 33rd degree, where they swear allegiance to Lucifer.
[13:29.000 --> 13:42.000]  And how they'll lie and kill and steal for other Masons and how they'll bash each other's brains out, how they'll cut the skull cap off and bury you in the sun for the sun to roast your brain, different degrees.
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  How they'll slit throats, murder, kill, engage in treason.
[13:46.000 --> 13:55.000]  And you guys, I mean, that's the thing. Masons claim they're good and the G's for God and you're helping and you're doing this great work, but look what you do.
[13:55.000 --> 14:10.000]  Most of your commanding cops are Masons. The top Catholics are all Masons. The top Ben-Abraith groups are all Masons. It's all Masonic.
[14:10.000 --> 14:20.000]  I mean, that's what the religion is. That's what they're into it, Bohemian Grove. That's what Skull and Bones is. It's really disgusting, really disgusting.
[14:20.000 --> 14:26.000]  And then I hear, well, the Founding Fathers were Masons and I hear, well, Sam Houston was a Mason.
[14:26.000 --> 14:34.000]  And it's all true. They were porch Masons. They were mid-level Masons. When they were old men, they usually became higher level and freaked out and spoke out against it.
[14:34.000 --> 14:45.000]  That's how the globalists always get control. They let well-meaning people charge in and take over areas and take over land and take over empire and then their people are in control.
[14:45.000 --> 15:01.000]  And it's so sophisticated. But I look at the New World Order and all the evil things it does, how it scientifically admits that it is dumbing everybody down, how it scientifically admits that it is trying to make us all unhealthy and poisonous so they can control us,
[15:01.000 --> 15:08.000]  how it scientifically admits that it's starting all these wars and funding all sides and order out of chaos.
[15:08.000 --> 15:34.000]  I mean, that is really bad. That is so corrupt and evil and so ruthless and so manifestly wicked, manifestly evil to do that to people.
[15:34.000 --> 15:50.000]  I don't care what excuses you make or what bizarre mental alchemy and psychological gymnastics you engage in, it really just comes down to a bunch of people that like power, like control, like to dominate, like to hurt people
[15:50.000 --> 16:03.000]  and malfunctioning whatever you want to call it and it goes back to good people, don't want power and control, they just want to live and be comfortable and happy and want to create.
[16:03.000 --> 16:12.000]  But the parasites, they want to dominate and control the creators and they feed off of us and use us and manipulate us and misdirect us and control us
[16:12.000 --> 16:24.000]  and they're turning us all into a bunch of wicked animals and I see the public just evil, just spreading, evil ideas, evil systems of thought are just running rampant
[16:24.000 --> 16:29.000]  and I see my beloved humanity has cancer all over our body.
[16:29.000 --> 16:56.000]  If humanity is 6.5 billion or 6 billion, 380 million, whatever our true number is, if we are a body, the body of humanity, we got brain cancer, we got lung cancer, we got skin cancer, we got pancreatic cancer, we've got liver cancer, bone cancer, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer,
[16:56.000 --> 17:15.000]  cancer of the optical nerve, the olfactory nerve, it's just so painful for me to see this and I feel people's pain because I know I'm connected to all of this, I know the great evil is going to hurt me and my family.
[17:15.000 --> 17:34.000]  And so I am programmed by my humanity to understand that when wickedness happens, that when the White House writes memos saying they can sexually torture two-year-olds with pliers, that that is the pit of hell opened and hell released
[17:34.000 --> 17:43.000]  and that if they are openly speaking and they understand the power of those acts that they carry out, they talk about the power of stating their evil.
[17:43.000 --> 17:56.000]  I mean that they are stating the ultimate evil, the sexual, brutal torture of children and that then the public accepts it and defends it and says, yes, torture is good, we're in a fight against radical Islam.
[17:56.000 --> 18:06.000]  When the globalists have fostered and pushed and protected radical Islam and tried to make it the dominant force in Islam.
[18:06.000 --> 18:16.000]  And that they fund Al-Qaeda admittedly to attack Serbia and Iran right now and Western Europe and it's just to then scare the dumb population to submission.
[18:16.000 --> 18:26.000]  Your ignorance is going to destroy you. I want that to be clear to everybody listening. We are in grave danger.
[18:26.000 --> 18:41.000]  We have very aggressive, scientifically directed, scientifically developed military, psychological, chemical, biological operations being conducted against all of us right now.
[18:41.000 --> 18:51.000]  And I'm just an average guy from Texas who reads globalist documents where they talk about how they take over our religion, how they talk about how they're poisoning us, how they talk about how they're sterilizing us,
[18:51.000 --> 19:05.000]  how they talk about how they're dumbing us down, how they laugh at us and say, well, is it not evidence that the public deserves to be poisoned and dumbed down and killed in an orderly fashion because they don't know our propaganda works on them?
[19:05.000 --> 19:09.000]  Is it that evidence they deserve it? No, that's not evidence they deserve it.
[19:09.000 --> 19:20.000]  Just because you can trick a child with candy or a puppy or another child into your van doesn't give you a right to sit there and torture the hell out of them.
[19:20.000 --> 19:33.000]  It makes you evil. The bizarre thrill of power you get by some begging two-year-old, three-year-old, you sons of bitches.
[19:33.000 --> 19:40.000]  You are cancer and I just want you to know that you're going to be defeated. You're going to be brought low. You're going to be crushed.
[19:40.000 --> 19:51.000]  I want you to know that and that's why anytime I waver in my heart and soul, I want you to know that I understand you must be defeated because you are pure darkness.
[20:21.000 --> 20:32.000]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.

[21:55.000 --> 22:03.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[22:03.000 --> 22:14.000]  That's right, gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[22:14.000 --> 22:22.000]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[22:22.000 --> 22:28.000]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[22:28.000 --> 22:34.000]  Try to take a look at gold for your retirement. Call 800-686-2237.

[22:54.000 --> 23:04.000]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine. Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.
[23:04.000 --> 23:13.000]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[23:13.000 --> 23:19.000]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.

[24:16.000 --> 24:25.000]  We've got Jake McGigan, Director of the Government Relations for the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
[24:25.000 --> 24:32.000]  About a key court case against the Second Amendment where the government is saying the Second Amendment is not admissible in a Second Amendment case.
[24:32.000 --> 24:39.000]  I've seen hundreds where the FBI goes to judges and says, don't allow the bill of rights into a court proceeding, and they say, yeah, it's not allowed. It's banned.
[24:39.000 --> 24:48.000]  Then Randy Kelton, who's been fighting and suing and getting police arrested and in trouble, and he'll be joining us in studio coming up in about an hour and a half, two hours.
[24:48.000 --> 24:55.000]  And then Karen Johnson, the state senator, who's been saying 9-11's an inside job, so join us for an hour, take your phone calls.
[24:55.000 --> 25:01.000]  Coming up today, I had her on for about 30 minutes a few weeks ago, and it was really interesting, so I want to have her back.
[25:01.000 --> 25:09.000]  Let me cover this first story up on PrisonPlanet.com right now from Trink Progress.
[25:09.000 --> 25:26.000]  It says, last year, former Deputy Attorney General James Comey revealed that in 2004, he refused to certify the legality, only get him on, of certain aspects of the National Security Agency.
[25:26.000 --> 25:36.000]  And it goes on, a spy program. And it says, Comey witnessed Alberta Gonzalez and Andrew Carr try to force a bedridden John Ashcroft to approve the program.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  Comey, however, did not publicly give specifics as to what the program he opposed.
[25:41.000 --> 25:57.000]  C.A.P. Peter Swern wrote to Think Progress at the time that Comey's testimony implied that other programs exist for domestic spying outside the NSA program. Radar's Christopher Ketchum suggests that another spy program does exist called main core.
[25:57.000 --> 26:04.000]  Doesn't suggest, we found it. A program that authorizes computer searches through massive, unspecified electronic databases.
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  Those are all the major internet providers, scan, record, everything. It doesn't go to the government, it is the government.
[26:09.000 --> 26:18.000]  They have echelons of equipment by law and everyone, fraudulently by regulatory systems, in order to discover potential threats in the event of a national emergency.
[26:18.000 --> 26:25.000]  But, see, they claim AI systems listen to your phone calls, read your emails so it's not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[26:25.000 --> 26:33.000]  Of course, just listening to any American on a phone was a felony each time they did it. So now they retroactively tried to legalize it.
[26:33.000 --> 26:41.000]  But notice that Congress didn't reauthorize that, so they just still keep committing crimes. The government is a pack of murdering crooks.
[26:41.000 --> 26:50.000]  Main core, a program that authorizes computer searches through massive, unspecified electronic databases in order to discover potential threats in the event of a national emergency.
[26:50.000 --> 27:02.000]  According to senior governmental official, there exists a database of Americans who often, for the slightest or most trivial of reasons, are considered unfriendly and who, in a time of panic, might be incarcerated.
[27:02.000 --> 27:08.000]  Yeah, exactly what we want in a real panic is to have the cops trying to arrest 8 million people. That'll work real well.
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  They can't do it, folks, not even with the doubling, tripling, quadrupling of their terror forces.
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.000]  The database can identify and locate perceived enemies of the state almost instantaneously.
[27:18.000 --> 27:26.000]  One acknowledged source claims that 8 million Americans are listed in the main core as potential suspects in the event of a national emergency.
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.000]  These people could be subject to everything from heightened surveillance and tracking to direct questioning and possibly even detention.
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.000]  Okay, from other programs integrated, let me tell you what this is.
[27:36.000 --> 27:48.000]  The globalists set off a nuke or fund some group of John Lee Rogers to do it, or they release the Black Death or whatever they've got cooked up.
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  Well, you know, they've weaponized everything.
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  And then they'll instantaneously have their talking points unified within minutes on the news.
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  Of course, any idiot would know that means they're behind it, but so what?
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  And they stand again, all their memos say they're going to do it.
[28:01.000 --> 28:07.000]  And of course, it'll all come out in the mix that they designed, whatever, but they've killed most of the microbiologists that could identify it or worked on their programs.
[28:07.000 --> 28:14.000]  Oh, hundreds, hundreds in the U.S. alone, kill them all the time.
[28:14.000 --> 28:19.000]  Neighbors will see you guys in black uniforms, drag them off to a van, and they're found drowned in a river.
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  That's total death forces getting ready to kill you and your family if they feel like it.
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  It's all part of the power trip for the New World Order, but they just turn everything will be turned off.
[28:28.000 --> 28:33.000]  Your credit cards, bank accounts, the minute you drive out, everything is scanned.
[28:33.000 --> 28:42.000]  Your license plates are scanned nationwide, everywhere you go at every major junction, middle of nowhere, Montana, Wyoming, West Texas, everything's scanned.
[28:42.000 --> 28:51.000]  And they'll just have shoot to kill orders, and the local cops will wait down the road for you when you drive by.
[28:51.000 --> 28:58.000]  They'll have tire spikes out in the road, and then they're just going to, with an armored vehicle, open fire with 50-cow on your vehicle and kill you and your whole family.
[28:58.000 --> 29:07.000]  Or when you try to go in and buy something, the face-scanning camera behind the counter, and by the law in Chicago, New York, they're making them wire all their cameras into it right now.
[29:07.000 --> 29:15.000]  It'll scan you, they'll go ahead and shell you the product, and then they will respond and they'll just gun you down.
[29:15.000 --> 29:22.000]  So just be advised, once all this unfolds, realize you don't have a choice but to fight back.
[29:22.000 --> 29:28.000]  You know, we've always been peaceful here, but at the point of, just know when you're coming up on them, they're going to be trying to kill you.
[29:28.000 --> 29:35.000]  That's 8 million of you, and they're going to be using foreign troops for most of it. We'll be right back.
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.000]  I'm going to leave you.
[30:09.000 --> 30:22.000]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[30:22.000 --> 30:31.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[30:31.000 --> 30:38.000]  The old America's making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need, they're after power.

[32:03.000 --> 32:18.000]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway. The government doesn't want the best for you. They keep you down. They keep you blue. They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[32:18.000 --> 32:27.000]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp. It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[32:27.000 --> 32:37.000]  I hope Mr. Busch will hear this song for the heart of America wants this one. Go to hempusa.org.

[33:09.000 --> 33:14.000]  I'm looking at the New York Sun headline a week and a half ago.
[33:14.000 --> 33:34.000]  A gag on Second Amendment in trial. And we have Jake McGuigan, I hope I'm pronouncing that right. A director of the government relations for the National Shooting Sports Foundation on with us.
[33:34.000 --> 33:49.000]  First, tell us a little bit about the organization and then let's get into some of the quotes that you and others had here in the article about how you can have a Second Amendment in a trial about the Second Amendment. It's pretty amazing.
[33:49.000 --> 33:57.000]  It is pretty amazing, Alex. My name is Jake McGuigan. I'm the director of government relations for the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
[33:57.000 --> 34:04.000]  We are the trade association for the firearms industry. People usually ask, well, how are you any different from the NRA?
[34:04.000 --> 34:15.000]  And the NRA represents individuals' rights. You know, your Second Amendment rights is an individual and we are representing the business side of things, the trade association.
[34:15.000 --> 34:30.000]  So we work very closely and work hand-in-hand on a lot of issues. If it's going to affect the individual, it'll affect the business and vice versa. So a lot of our members are the manufacturers like Smith and Weston, Beretta, Winchester and the like.
[34:30.000 --> 34:45.000]  So that's where we're coming from and we're pretty closely involved in a lot of these lawsuits where they're suing whether it's the retailers, which we also represent, or manufacturers, as we know in the past.
[34:45.000 --> 34:53.000]  And there are still some lawsuits pending out there where people are trying to sue the gun manufacturers for liability.
[34:53.000 --> 35:04.000]  So the general counsel of your organization, which is one of the largest in the country by the way, folks, for gun owners rights, says apparently Mayor Bloomberg has a problem with both the First and Second Amendment.
[35:04.000 --> 35:14.000]  Lawrence Keane, the general counsel of a firearms industry association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation said. And there's more quotes in here.
[35:14.000 --> 35:35.000]  That's a great quote. I told them that was a very telling quote. Mayor Bloomberg, as many gun owners probably know, has a personal agenda to go after, whether it's the retailers, whether he is going after retailers, blaming them for illegal sales,
[35:35.000 --> 35:44.000]  or purchases, as well as the industry itself with various other piece of regulations in place.
[35:44.000 --> 35:59.000]  So this is just another step forward for Mayor Bloomberg. Now, like Larry Keane said, what he wants to do is neuter or remove the Second Amendment from this trial.
[35:59.000 --> 36:10.000]  This is a shop in Georgia who is getting sued by Mayor Bloomberg saying that he is taking part in legal gun sales.
[36:10.000 --> 36:19.000]  And Mayor Bloomberg has sued 27 out-of-state gun shops in his little sting that he has been doing on his own.
[36:19.000 --> 36:35.000]  And this is just another attempt to try to close down small retailers or to get them settled. And Mr. Wallace, who owns Adventure Outdoors in Georgia, also has a countersuit against Mayor Bloomberg for defamation.
[36:35.000 --> 36:43.000]  And this is well, and he is going forward with this lawsuit where they're trying to take the Second Amendment out as well as his countersuit against Mayor Bloomberg.
[36:43.000 --> 36:53.000]  It's a lot of fun down there on this. And, you know, to be perfectly honest with you, you got Mayor Bloomberg going after these states saying that they're sore states,
[36:53.000 --> 37:05.000]  and that's where all the illegal guns are coming from. Yet you look at ATF statistics and all the guns used in crimes in number one state, sore state, is New York state.
[37:05.000 --> 37:21.000]  Well, this is an insane new president they're trying to set that mayors and governors are like many federal kings who can rule surrounding states or states that are 800 miles away like Georgia.
[37:21.000 --> 37:30.000]  So this is absolutely out of control. I mean, it's like claiming New York as a federal government and has this interstate commerce clause, which is even fraudulent when the feds claim it.
[37:30.000 --> 37:42.000]  Here's some quotes from the arguments concerning the gang order. Any references by counsel, the Second Amendment or analogous state constitutional provisions are likewise irrelevant.
[37:42.000 --> 37:49.000]  So they're saying even our state rights are irrelevant in our state courts because government's law lawless. That's what their attorney said.
[37:49.000 --> 38:00.000]  And that goes on. If you can't discuss the Bill of Rights in the court of law, where should we discuss these issues? Should we reserve it for the tavern?
[38:00.000 --> 38:10.000]  Mr. Runa Zelle said the city's lawsuit did implicate the Second Amendment. The politics involved here is whether the city has the power to go to another state and control the lawful sale of firearms.
[38:10.000 --> 38:23.000]  But the my boss son, Mayor Daly, is also trying to go after guns all over the country right here in Texas. I mean, these guys want the monopoly of force of government to basically be our gods.
[38:23.000 --> 38:38.000]  And I, for one, sir, am tired of it. As the director of government relations, when you're dealing with government, we know the UN said at the Uniteer Summit in New York on July 7, 2000 that they are for banning ownership of all guns in the U.S.
[38:38.000 --> 38:49.000]  We know this is also a global agenda. And I see the Second Amendment under greater attack now than ever. But frankly, I don't hear the NRA and others ringing the alarm bells that they've tripled the size of the BATF.
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.000]  And the Second Amendment is going under like the Titanic.
[38:52.000 --> 39:11.000]  And you know what? I would agree with you 100 percent. This is a battle that needs to go all the way down to the grassroots level and to us representing the manufacturers. And the gun deal is throughout the U.S. because what you said is something we are facing.
[39:11.000 --> 39:22.000]  We're facing on the international level with the UN. We are facing it on the local level, whether it's with the Brady Campaign or the Educational Fund to Stop Handgun Violence, whatever their name is.
[39:22.000 --> 39:31.000]  And, you know, they, you know, are working together and unifying because they think, you know, that they're gaining power in this.
[39:31.000 --> 39:44.000]  And like you said, whether it's the UN, whether it's the mayor's against illegal guns, which is Bloomberg's local coalition, where he thinks he can go after states where he feels that guns are coming from.
[39:44.000 --> 39:52.000]  You know, it's, and not even that, overstepping the bounds of the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[39:52.000 --> 40:06.000]  They are, he is overstepping those bounds and he's been told by both of those agencies, hey, this is our area to investigate. You are involving yourselves in investigations and you're compromising the safety of law enforcement officials.
[40:06.000 --> 40:19.000]  So, you know, it's a difficult battle, you know, and hopefully the Supreme Court comes out with a strong case, but I wouldn't be holding my breath on that decision either, you know, in June.
[40:19.000 --> 40:33.000]  You never know what's going to happen with that. So, you know, like you said, I tell people, you know, all the time that, you know, depending on how you feel about the political arena or the president right now,
[40:33.000 --> 40:43.000]  you know, putting John Bolton into the UN was one of the greatest moves just because of his stance that he did for us and for gun owners and for the industry.
[40:43.000 --> 40:55.000]  In that vote that you said back in 2000 where the Small Arms Treaty that they were trying to pass, he would be one dissenting vote out of everyone in the UN.
[40:55.000 --> 41:01.000]  So, you know, that is a tremendous, tremendous, you know, position to take.
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  Now, I understand that, but it's like Bush saying in speeches, we have an individual right to own guns and less prescribed by law.
[41:07.000 --> 41:18.000]  And that's what I'm seeing happen with the Supreme Court ruling from reading the oral arguments and then the different briefs made by the NRA, the anti-gun folks and then the people that were suing for their rights,
[41:18.000 --> 41:26.000]  the disarmed security guard who was attacked and you're sitting there looking at it and they're going to come out in the next month or two.
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  I guarantee it in rule and then it's going to be hailed as a pro-second amendment ruling.
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  They're going to say, oh, you got an individual right unless prescribed by law.
[41:34.000 --> 41:45.000]  And then they're going to say, okay, now we can ban your guns or kind of be like New York City, where if you jump through 45 flaming hoops on, you know, standing on your head with your arms tied behind your back,
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  that maybe you might be able to own a gun.
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  And that, and that's, that's my biggest fear.
[41:50.000 --> 41:57.000]  You know, even, even personally, that it's going to be this, whatever they constitute a reasonable restriction on a state level, on a city level.
[41:57.000 --> 42:06.000]  I mean, what this will do is most likely open up the door for lawsuits, whether we're dealing with Cook County in Chicago or like you said, New York City, you know,
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  where they're going to challenge what is a reasonable restriction, you know.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  There is no reasonable restriction and then once you, we need Vermont.
[42:15.000 --> 42:22.000]  Look, the places with the lowest crime, Vermont, places like Arizona, as you know, but for listeners, they have the lowest crime rate, even in big urban areas.
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  It's areas like New York City, like Chicago, that have these corrupt big city mayors that rule over their slaves.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  That's what they are, disarmed persons, a slave.
[42:31.000 --> 42:38.000]  And the, I mean, it's just amazing that they disarm us when the average 9-11 call takes 11 minutes to respond to.
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  They have no right to disarm me so the criminals can have their way with me.
[42:42.000 --> 42:57.000]  I agree with you 100% and it's not even that disarming, it's even the further steps that they're taking, whether it's legislation like bullet serialization or microstamping of firearms.
[42:57.000 --> 43:08.000]  I mean, microstamping right now is a major threat because that is going to force the industry if passed on California, already passed legislation.
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.000]  And then that standardizes cars, air conditioning, it's all on California standards the most pop.
[43:12.000 --> 43:15.000]  Explain what Schwarzenegger's done, the so-called Republican.
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  Sure, I'll just give you a quick rundown for a lot of you listeners who may not know.
[43:19.000 --> 43:32.000]  What Arnold Schwarzenegger has done, he signed what's going to mandate microstamping of handguns of firearms in California as of July, January 1, 2010.
[43:32.000 --> 43:45.000]  What that means is that the firing pin of a handgun needs to be microstamped with the serial number or identifying characters which will imprint on the cartridge casing in theory.
[43:45.000 --> 43:53.000]  And that'll make all of the gun manufacturers adopt a certain amount of guns that have that and then it'll be adopted all over the country.
[43:53.000 --> 43:58.000]  It'll bankrupt a lot of them and then next they're talking about not letting you own a gun unless it has that.
[43:58.000 --> 44:02.000]  So when you get the certification that you had it added, now you've been registered.
[44:02.000 --> 44:03.000]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[44:03.000 --> 44:07.000]  But the thing is, it doesn't work.
[44:07.000 --> 44:08.000]  It's easily defeated.
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.000]  As most of you listeners know, you can swap out a firing pin in less than a minute.
[44:13.000 --> 44:16.000]  But that's a reason to swap to your house to see if you've done that.
[44:16.000 --> 44:17.000]  Yeah, or exactly.
[44:17.000 --> 44:26.000]  Or the criminals will move to revolvers or they will just file down the firing pin so that that identifier is not on there.
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  This is not a gun.
[44:28.000 --> 44:29.000]  It doesn't work.
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.000]  It doesn't work.
[44:30.000 --> 44:31.000]  It's a new tax.
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  But we know what it's about destroying the second amendment.
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  And we don't oppose it from a gun control standpoint.
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  We oppose it from the fact that it doesn't work.
[44:38.000 --> 44:46.000]  It's going to enforce the manufacturers to spend a ton of money and then where is it going to get passed on to the end consumer where it's going to be?
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.000]  We don't know.
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.000]  It could be as high as $200 per firearm because there's only one inventor.
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  There's only one inventor of the technology.
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.000]  So he can price it for whatever he wants to price it at.
[44:57.000 --> 44:58.000]  Unbelievable.
[44:58.000 --> 44:59.000]  This is disgusting.
[44:59.000 --> 45:00.000]  We've got to get this repealed.
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  We've got to get Schwarzenegger out of there.
[45:02.000 --> 45:12.000]  It was a, you know, I think it was a family situation where Senator Kennedy is sponsoring the same legislation on the federal level.
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  And it was, you know...
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.000]  Well, I'm sad for him that his brain tumor is going to handle that.
[45:18.000 --> 45:24.000]  I mean, this guy wants me and my family to be disarmed so we can be raped and killed.
[45:24.000 --> 45:31.000]  And, you know, it's just, I hope when he faces his maker that he's proud of himself for all the victim disarmament he's done.
[45:31.000 --> 45:38.000]  Because the Kennedy gun control family is responsible for hundreds of thousands of people who've been victims of crime with all their gun control.
[45:38.000 --> 45:43.000]  And in Massachusetts and other places, it's a shameful family.
[45:43.000 --> 45:51.000]  And, you know what, a lot of the stats aren't out there of the number of crimes that have been thwarted from just showing or brandishing a firearm.
[45:51.000 --> 45:59.000]  You know, that's the thing that, you know, they want to say, you know, oh, it shouldn't be in the hands of law-abiding citizens.
[45:59.000 --> 46:00.000]  Only authorities should have it.
[46:00.000 --> 46:01.000]  And this is not the other thing.
[46:01.000 --> 46:11.000]  But they can't quote or they don't have the statistics to show how many crimes have been stopped from happening and how much personal protection comes from it.
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.000]  Well, you are on the same page, I believe.
[46:15.000 --> 46:16.000]  Well, yes, sir.
[46:16.000 --> 46:25.000]  We're talking, of course, ladies and gentlemen, to the fellow that is the main director of government relations with the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
[46:25.000 --> 46:32.000]  In closing, with the two or three minutes we've got left, give us the website, how folks get involved, how they support the Second Amendment.
[46:32.000 --> 46:37.000]  And then anything else that's happening that's important news we should know about.
[46:37.000 --> 46:44.000]  Right off the bat, our website is nsf.org.
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  That's nsf.org.
[46:46.000 --> 46:52.000]  And, you know, we, you'll see a lot of our programs where you offer, we have this classically target program.
[46:52.000 --> 47:01.000]  And, you know, a lot of programs to get younger generation involved in shooting sports and hunting.
[47:01.000 --> 47:07.000]  At the same time, we have our legislative side of things where we are lobbying for the firearms manufacturers.
[47:07.000 --> 47:11.000]  For advice to give to people, unified.
[47:11.000 --> 47:20.000]  Being unified, whether it's being a member of the NRA, whether it's being a member of your local sportsman's coalition or your local range or gun shop,
[47:20.000 --> 47:26.000]  just supporting these individuals and everyone that has the same view, supporting the Second Amendment.
[47:26.000 --> 47:33.000]  It's, you know, the other side is very well organized and they have, you know, more than enough when it comes to funding.
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.000]  We need to make sure that we do the same thing and all work together on this.
[47:37.000 --> 47:45.000]  I know there are sometimes contentious issues where, you know, some groups don't agree, but, you know, we need to make sure that coming down,
[47:45.000 --> 47:55.000]  whether it's this election cycle, you know, both on the local level and on the national level, it comes down to putting in the people that are going to represent you.
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.000]  And representing your Second Amendment rights to the best of their ability.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  So that's the best advice I can give right now.
[48:01.000 --> 48:09.000]  You know, it is a constant battle and it, you know, keeps me gainfully employed day in and day out.
[48:09.000 --> 48:13.000]  Well, sir, thank you for joining us. Thank you for spending time with us.
[48:13.000 --> 48:22.000]  Where do you see this going in New York with Mayor Bloomberg saying you're not allowed to talk about the Second Amendment and putting out an imperial gag order?
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  I'm not sure it'll be worth, you know, be used against him.
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.000]  I mean, you know, there in some cases, some people, you know, can tell what's allowed in the courtroom, what's not.
[48:34.000 --> 48:41.000]  To be honest with you, Bloomberg's reputation among us, among gun owners, among the NRA is obviously not going to change.
[48:41.000 --> 48:48.000]  We already know what we're dealing with and the people who support him in his home, let's say, city of New York City.
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.000]  You know, probably not going to change their opinion either.
[48:52.000 --> 49:01.000]  I just hope that, you know, Mr. Wallace from Adventure Outdoors continues to move forward with his counter suit
[49:01.000 --> 49:06.000]  and really, you know, defend gun owners and gun retailers.
[49:06.000 --> 49:13.000]  Because a lot of times, Bloomberg thinks with the large checkbook he has, he can bully the small retailers, get them to settle out of court.
[49:13.000 --> 49:18.000]  And this is one individual that said, you know what, I've had enough of this, I'm not settled and I'm going to have a counter suit.
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  So I wish all the luck to anybody.
[49:20.000 --> 49:25.000]  But he's outside his jurisdiction in purview. Bloomberg needs to be sued individually.
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  Well, I would support that 100%.
[49:29.000 --> 49:36.000]  And you know, even when you have federal organizations also saying that he's outside his jurisdiction,
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.000]  and this is nothing where he should not be, you know, working.
[49:40.000 --> 49:51.000]  You know, DOJ had told him to stop his, you know, little investigations and his investigators that he had down in Virginia and Georgia and all those areas.
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.000]  And the funny thing is, he points to Virginia as being a source state.
[49:55.000 --> 50:02.000]  Well, explain to me, since Virginia has one gun a month, how they're bringing all these illegal firearms from Virginia into New York City.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  Doesn't make much sense, does it?
[50:04.000 --> 50:09.000]  No, it's just a way to also create a unified database because these mayors, as you know, have been demanding,
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  you know, a quote database to track all these quote crime guns.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  Well, thank you so much for joining us, sir. I appreciate the time.
[50:15.000 --> 50:16.000]  I appreciate it, Alex. Thank you.
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.000]  Take care.
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.000]  Okay, I just wanted to give you an update on the Second Amendment there.
[50:20.000 --> 50:25.000]  We're going to come back into some of the financial news and I'm going to cover a bunch of world news.
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.000]  The Violent Radicalization Act are trying to pass it again.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  We're now learning more about these databases for mass arrest.
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.000]  Don't let that intimidate you folks. You're not going to be able to get away with it.
[50:36.000 --> 50:41.000]  If we cower, they win. If we stand up, the globalists lose big time.
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  And the article's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[50:44.000 --> 50:49.000]  We need your help getting this out to everyone and the YouTube video of an interview with Jesse Ventura.
[50:49.000 --> 51:18.000]  Ventura slams media witch hunt for questioning 9-11. Get it?
[51:19.000 --> 51:22.000]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.000]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,
[51:26.000 --> 51:30.000]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[51:45.000 --> 51:49.000]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war. Truth is our weapon.
[51:49.000 --> 51:54.000]  And PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[51:54.000 --> 52:00.000]  Another untold story here it comes.
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  Another untold story here it comes.
[52:04.000 --> 52:09.000]  Another untold story that you have not been told from.
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.000]  Another untold story.com.
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  This is the story of the honest reporter.
[52:17.000 --> 52:20.000]  Oh, but you may say, aren't all reporters honest?
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  Not according to the story of the honest reporter, John Swinton,
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.000]  a former chief of staff of the New York Times.
[52:26.000 --> 52:31.000]  Of course, we've been programmed with story after story that reporters are honest.
[52:31.000 --> 52:37.000]  Think of how many TV programs, Hollywood movies, and the like you've seen, read, and heard
[52:37.000 --> 52:42.000]  of secret corruption and scandal and finally the good guys get it to the even
[52:42.000 --> 52:49.000]  gooder guys and or gal reporters who break the news and get the truth out to the people.
[52:49.000 --> 52:55.000]  People, what if it's all a ruse, a lie, and the so-called good guys and gal reporters
[52:55.000 --> 53:01.000]  are in reality the corrupt, scandalous, bought-off bad guys?
[53:01.000 --> 53:06.000]  In 1953, John Swinton, the former chief of staff of the New York Times,
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.000]  who was called by his peers the dean of his profession,
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.000]  asked to give a toast before the New York Press Club.
[53:14.000 --> 53:18.000]  He was retiring and so he spoke the honest truth in that toast.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  A truth that is being kept from you.
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  What did he say?
[53:21.000 --> 53:26.000]  Well, go to anotheruntoldstory.com and find out.
[53:26.000 --> 53:31.000]  It's about time we find out what these lying scribes are all about.
[53:31.000 --> 53:34.000]  Anotheruntoldstory.com.
[53:34.000 --> 53:40.000]  For another untold story go to anotheruntoldstory.com.
[53:40.000 --> 53:43.000]  Anotheruntoldstory.com.
[53:43.000 --> 53:48.000]  Anotheruntoldstory.com.
[53:48.000 --> 54:08.800]  There's a lot of patriot mythology out there about how to go after corrupt police, judges,
[54:08.800 --> 54:13.680]  other forms of demigod.
[54:13.680 --> 54:16.120]  But Randy Kelton's had some real success here in Texas.
[54:16.120 --> 54:23.360]  He'll be in the studio with us in about an hour.
[54:23.360 --> 54:29.880]  I'm going to play some excerpts to analyze the propaganda and disinfo from the Howard
[54:29.880 --> 54:32.720]  Stern Show with Jesse Ventura this morning.
[54:32.720 --> 54:40.880]  He, of course, was on with us for 50 minutes yesterday.
[54:40.880 --> 54:43.560]  We'll be breaking that down as well.
[54:43.560 --> 54:50.000]  Right now, supply concern puts oil above 130 for the first time.
[54:50.000 --> 54:55.480]  Another AP disinfo headline, in all the foreign press has admitted OPEC has put out releases
[54:55.480 --> 55:00.560]  saying we have not increased prices, we have increased production in the last two years,
[55:00.560 --> 55:03.160]  which is true.
[55:03.160 --> 55:04.880]  Your dollar has been devalued.
[55:04.880 --> 55:08.760]  You make us denominate the oil in dollars, which is hurting us.
[55:08.760 --> 55:13.880]  You ask us to stay in dollars, the Arab nations, which are what, 70-some percent of OPEC than
[55:13.880 --> 55:15.920]  Venezuela's the rest.
[55:15.920 --> 55:18.760]  They sell it to the oil company so that they're all running scams.
[55:18.760 --> 55:22.480]  I'm not saying they're good, and they are gouging us a bit, but that was already going
[55:22.480 --> 55:23.480]  on.
[55:23.480 --> 55:28.960]  They mainly gouged us by not letting us get oil out of Alaska and other areas.
[55:28.960 --> 55:30.120]  We've got tons of it.
[55:30.120 --> 55:34.560]  They're creating artificial scarcity through a cartel.
[55:34.560 --> 55:40.160]  But the house has passed a bill to sue OPEC over oil prices, demanding they lower it.
[55:40.160 --> 55:41.160]  It's the dollar.
[55:41.160 --> 55:45.400]  Ninety percent of the increase, if you do the numbers, is dollar devaluation.
[55:45.400 --> 55:46.520]  That's why gold's gone up.
[55:46.520 --> 55:47.640]  That's why corn's gone up.
[55:47.640 --> 55:48.640]  That's one of the big reasons.
[55:48.640 --> 55:54.000]  There's a few others with the food, droughts and some problems in speculation.
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.920]  And now we have major brokerage firms, Goldman Sachs and others, again, saying $200 of barrel
[55:58.920 --> 55:59.920]  oil soon.
[55:59.920 --> 56:04.520]  Look, I don't know if that's going to happen, folks, but they couldn't keep, they dumped
[56:04.520 --> 56:08.440]  hundreds of billions of gold onto the market in the last three months.
[56:08.440 --> 56:11.600]  They drove it down from 1,000-something to 800-something.
[56:11.600 --> 56:15.040]  It's well above 900 again, silver's exploding again.
[56:15.040 --> 56:16.680]  You need to move on gold and silver now.
[56:16.680 --> 56:22.960]  I've been telling you that, and because if they continue to devalue the dollar, and
[56:22.960 --> 56:25.400]  they're saying they're going to go all the way on this, I don't know if that's the case,
[56:25.400 --> 56:30.240]  but my goodness, then gold and silver is one of the few commodities you can hold.
[56:30.240 --> 56:35.640]  You're not going to be able to hold pork bellies or grain, or that's all going to
[56:35.640 --> 56:36.960]  be digital.
[56:36.960 --> 56:39.120]  This is something you can hold in your hot little hand.
[56:39.120 --> 56:41.440]  Ted Anderson, tell us where gold and silver is today.
[56:41.440 --> 56:42.440]  Yeah, sure.
[56:42.440 --> 56:48.240]  Right now, silver is just touching $18 an ounce again now, $17.95.
[56:48.240 --> 56:54.840]  Gold right now is at $9.29.70, so it's just short of poking into $9.30.
[56:54.840 --> 56:58.880]  It's almost like it's forgotten about all that resistance stuff that was going on, like
[56:58.880 --> 57:03.040]  you're talking about with the banks selling just metric tons of gold in the marketplace
[57:03.040 --> 57:05.160]  to keep it down.
[57:05.160 --> 57:07.600]  Right now, it's just like the accelerators back on again.
[57:07.600 --> 57:11.760]  It's just blowing through these levels faster than it did last time, which is surprising
[57:11.760 --> 57:12.760]  to me.
[57:12.760 --> 57:16.720]  I thought it would take a little bit more time to eat up this correction, but it's just coming
[57:16.720 --> 57:19.480]  back like a vengeance.
[57:19.480 --> 57:21.640]  Silver right now, $17.95.
[57:21.640 --> 57:23.280]  Gold, $9.29.70.
[57:23.280 --> 57:25.360]  The dollar is down today.
[57:25.360 --> 57:28.480]  Just about every other currency is up the Dow Jones Industrial down.
[57:28.480 --> 57:33.160]  I mean, everything economically shows that, yeah, you're just exactly hitting the nail
[57:33.160 --> 57:34.520]  right on the head.
[57:34.520 --> 57:39.440]  Dollars falling, commodities are going to be going up, it's going to be raising havoc
[57:39.440 --> 57:44.680]  in the financial markets, and that's why we're seeing the Dow Jones Industrial taking a hit
[57:44.680 --> 57:49.880]  on the chin, and sure enough, gold and silver up again today.
[57:49.880 --> 57:53.760]  Right now, I'm going to just continue to add that to the same special we did yesterday.
[57:53.760 --> 57:56.120]  I haven't changed the prices a bit.
[57:56.120 --> 58:02.400]  Now gold, almost $18.00 an ounce, and these walking Liberty halves, you know, I've got
[58:02.400 --> 58:03.400]  them.
[58:03.400 --> 58:04.400]  You mean silver $18.00?
[58:04.400 --> 58:07.160]  Yeah, silver right now, $18.00 an ounce.
[58:07.160 --> 58:10.480]  Really good buys in the marketplace right now, holding the same prices.
[58:10.480 --> 58:11.960]  I know we're going to the break.
[58:11.960 --> 58:13.920]  You want to talk about this on the other side or?
[58:13.920 --> 58:14.920]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[58:14.920 --> 58:19.240]  You got this gold and silver like a week ago when it was lower, it's now going up.
[58:19.240 --> 58:21.240]  You've got it locked in for a limited time.
[58:21.240 --> 58:30.120]  Again, folks, take advantage of this, 1-800-686-2237, call them right now before these prices
[58:30.120 --> 58:31.120]  go up.
[58:31.120 --> 58:32.120]  We'll be right back.

[58:53.120 --> 58:59.360]  It's known as the Builderberg, put their objective being world domination.
[58:59.360 --> 59:04.760]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world
[59:04.760 --> 59:12.880]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[59:25.880 --> 59:26.880]  They're not after money.
[59:26.880 --> 59:27.880]  They have all the money they need.
[59:27.880 --> 59:28.880]  They're after power.
[59:28.880 --> 59:29.880]  They're after happiness.

[59:37.640 --> 59:46.760]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[59:46.760 --> 59:58.720]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[59:58.720 --> 1:00:17.560]  During the breaks, I've been listening to clips, Burmese was out there listening to
[1:00:17.560 --> 1:00:24.000]  Jesse Ventura from a few hours ago on the Creighton-Howard Stern show, Ventura went
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:29.320]  further and said basically building seven was an insurance scam.
[1:00:29.320 --> 1:00:30.800]  This is absolutely huge.
[1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:35.120]  Paul Watson will be airing the audio in T-minus eight minutes.
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:36.120]  Get ready.
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:40.840]  I want to blurb article up now and I want our listeners to jam this forewind to every
[1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:47.080]  corner of the planet because the enemy will bite on this and all the tens of millions
[1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:52.480]  of moron Howard Stern fans will then finally wake up because Stern is babbling and stuttering
[1:00:52.480 --> 1:00:54.240]  during it.
[1:00:54.240 --> 1:00:56.720]  Again I just commend Jesse Ventura's courage.
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:00:59.560]  Again it isn't that we worship Ventura, he's perfect.
[1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:04.760]  It's that this is a celebrity culture, he's a former Navy SEAL demolition expert.
[1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:06.040]  Burmese has been listening to 20 minutes of it.
[1:01:06.040 --> 1:01:07.040]  We got a five minute clip.
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:10.840]  I'm going to have Burmese come in in a minute but let's go back to Ted Anderson.
[1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:13.800]  Ted, the country is going to hell in a handbasket.
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:16.160]  You've got great prizes on gold and silver.
[1:01:16.160 --> 1:01:19.400]  You've got this price, I know you told me it's locked in.
[1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:21.960]  When is this price locked in from because I know it's gone up?
[1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:30.240]  Well, when we were at $888 gold and when we had silver at $16 and roughly $16.60 an ounce,
[1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:34.760]  I picked up the walking liberty halves and I also picked up the British sovereigns and
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:38.480]  also the French, Swiss, Franks, those.
[1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:43.440]  And currently right now we are carrying the Franks at $199.
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:48.000]  I have the British sovereigns at $250 and I have these walking liberties which I couldn't
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:54.120]  even sell four weeks ago because I couldn't get them at $182 per roll.
[1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:55.120]  Not kidding, Alex.
[1:01:55.120 --> 1:01:57.200]  I mean, I just was completely sold out.
[1:01:57.200 --> 1:02:01.680]  Not only me, Kitco and all the major gold dealers and silver dealers in the United States.
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:06.760]  Yes, a lot of them are still sold out and now the run on it has started again as the dollar
[1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:07.760]  further implodes.
[1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:12.560]  And folks, if you watch the graph, the dollar plunges by five, and I'm just saying it as
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:16.600]  a hypothetical number, then it goes back up by three, then it plunges by five, back up
[1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:19.440]  by two, plunges by three, back up by one.
[1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:24.840]  You know, it's always going down and then you get fooled when gold has a minor correction.
[1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:28.320]  But if you look at the six month year, two year, five year graph, it's going straight
[1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:29.320]  up.
[1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:30.320]  It's going to.
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:32.400]  The dollar is going down the tubes.
[1:02:32.400 --> 1:02:33.800]  You got to give Ted a call.
[1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:34.800]  Ted, give him the number.
[1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:44.680]  Yeah, it's 1-800-686-2237, again, it's 1-800-686-2237 and you got to remember, $182 is the price
[1:02:44.680 --> 1:02:45.680]  right now.
[1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:51.280]  Last time I had gold or last time I had silver over $18, these are trading at 205 per roll.
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:54.840]  So this is a really good buy and I would suggest you get in them now.
[1:02:54.840 --> 1:02:59.720]  Now, again, folks, you need to get into real metals, real commodities.
[1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:04.040]  This is one of the only portable commodities that is out there other than food and that's
[1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:06.720]  again hard to carry around with you.
[1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:09.880]  Understand precious metals, gold and silver, move into it now.
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:11.160]  You can't beat this deal.
[1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:12.160]  Give them the number, Ted.
[1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:17.640]  Yeah, again, 1-800-686-2237 and all you got to do is watch what's going on economically.
[1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:19.640]  You have plenty of reasons to get in.
[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:22.960]  If you're not scared from your investments that you have in paper right now, you should
[1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:25.160]  be, you better take a serious look at that point.
[1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:27.400]  And I want to explain something.
[1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:28.400]  It's artificial.
[1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:30.920]  They are buying the stock market with devalued dollars.
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:35.760]  So the stock market isn't really $12,000, it's really $6,000.
[1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:37.920]  Okay, I keep trying to explain that.
[1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:44.360]  The stock market is down and it's only the top 30 and it's down by half.
[1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:45.440]  Let me explain.
[1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:47.000]  The fraud is systemic.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:50.880]  That's why they built FEMA camps, why the cops have been brainwashed, us against them
[1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:54.400]  because they know the globalists are going to take it all.
[1:03:54.400 --> 1:03:56.600]  And all I'm telling you is try to protect yourself.
[1:03:56.600 --> 1:04:02.880]  1-800-686-2237, 1-800-686-2237.
[1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:08.360]  And again, tell them it's the Alex Jones special or you'll be paying today's prices.
[1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:10.400]  You know, Ted is a businessman.
[1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:11.840]  You are getting an insane deal.
[1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:16.400]  He does this just to introduce you to Golden Silver on my show and to support our listeners
[1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:18.200]  that have supported us.
[1:04:18.200 --> 1:04:21.640]  There is literally a paltry 4% add-on to this.
[1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:25.960]  And if you look at the increase in the last week in prices, you're getting this at below
[1:04:25.960 --> 1:04:33.560]  cost 1-800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:35.560]  You missed that number, minusresources.com.
[1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:37.280]  Ted Anderson, thank you.
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:38.280]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:41.760]  We'll be right back with huge Jesse Ventura 9-11 truth developments.
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:54.480]  It's all blowing wide open.
[1:04:54.480 --> 1:04:57.080]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship.
[1:04:57.080 --> 1:05:00.360]  Martial law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:02.360]  It's going to be incremental.
[1:05:02.360 --> 1:05:04.280]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[1:05:04.280 --> 1:05:07.560]  Any incident, small or large could trigger a total takeover.
[1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:08.960]  Anything could be the final push.

[1:05:26.360 --> 1:05:29.560]  will occur for registered gun owners, and cities will be on lockdown.
[1:05:29.560 --> 1:05:32.400]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years, preparing for

[1:05:57.680 --> 1:05:59.240]  hour there is hope.

[1:06:51.400 --> 1:06:54.480]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[1:06:54.480 --> 1:07:00.080]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[1:07:00.080 --> 1:07:04.640]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which
[1:07:04.640 --> 1:07:05.640]  are synthetic.
[1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:07.040]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:07:07.040 --> 1:07:10.760]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[1:07:10.760 --> 1:07:15.280]  coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin,
[1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:16.280]  and mucous membranes.

[1:07:54.680 --> 1:07:59.040]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:07:59.040 --> 1:08:05.240]  Okay, huge new development.
[1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:10.640]  Bermas being from New York, Jason Bermas of Loose Change fame, down here working with
[1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:17.400]  us on the film, and he's making whole fabled enemies that gets into some of the foreign
[1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:21.120]  governments that were involved, very controversial.
[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:28.800]  Bermas is here with us in studio, and he has listened to most of the hour-long interview
[1:08:28.800 --> 1:08:30.040]  with Jesse Ventura this morning.
[1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:34.240]  In fact, he would only give Stern 40 minutes, so 40-minute interview, gave us 50, that was
[1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:39.960]  nice to the governor, and they start attacking him, and he goes ahead and brings up insurance
[1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:42.000]  fraud with blowing up the buildings.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  This is huge.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  This is big.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.720]  I wanted to bring it yesterday, and I just didn't get around to it.
[1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:48.240]  Who does he think did it?
[1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:49.240]  Why did they do it?
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:51.760]  You know, he talked about how he thinks somebody blew it up, and the government's done stuff
[1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:56.320]  before he implied it, but I didn't get to that.
[1:08:56.320 --> 1:08:57.320]  But here it is.
[1:08:57.320 --> 1:09:00.040]  The more he gets attacked, the more he's going to come out, and then this just gives
[1:09:00.040 --> 1:09:01.600]  others the courage to speak out.
[1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:06.880]  Bermas, before we play this five-minute clip, you've heard more than just the five minutes.
[1:09:06.880 --> 1:09:10.320]  Tell us exactly what you heard this morning.
[1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:11.320]  Sure.
[1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:15.040]  Basically, he goes over how the only way that our country would go down is from an internal
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:17.120]  enemy, and that whole thing.
[1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:18.120]  Oh, my God.
[1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:19.120]  Yeah, it was great.
[1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:20.560]  Internal enemies carried out 9-11.
[1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:22.880]  Jesse Ventura, we need a headline with that.
[1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:28.480]  Another one on, says 9-11 was insurance fraud, or, oh, my God, attack right now, man.
[1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:29.480]  Get the articles up.
[1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:30.480]  Go ahead.
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:34.200]  So, they bring up, well, you're one of those guys that doesn't think that two planes could
[1:09:34.200 --> 1:09:37.360]  bring down three buildings, and he brings up buildings seven quick, but then he also
[1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:42.120]  brings up how the World Trade Center, Twin Towers, weren't making money anymore, and
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:46.880]  then it was going to cost a billion dollars to take the asbestos out, at least.
[1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:49.920]  And then he mentioned the $7 billion insurance scam.
[1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:52.440]  He didn't mention Silverstein by name, but he basically said-
[1:09:52.440 --> 1:09:54.920]  But why not just blow him up and let the city breathe it?
[1:09:54.920 --> 1:10:00.000]  That's how you use each of New York Child and Cop and Firefighter as a vacuum to get
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  rid of it.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  That was cheaper.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  Well, demolition was not an option.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  That's the other thing.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:07.720]  They were not going to be allowed to demolish the Twin Trade Center and control demolition.
[1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:11.960]  They had to go floor-by-floor to take out the asbestos, and lo and behold, 9-11 happens
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:13.600]  and it becomes a non-issue.
[1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:17.480]  So he mentioned, you know, this guy made $7 billion, all of a sudden, Howard's like,
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:20.280]  well, man, I guess I'm going to have to read your book.
[1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:22.520]  And he's like, yeah, you really do need to read my book.
[1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:23.960]  So he exposed the insurance scam.
[1:10:23.960 --> 1:10:26.680]  He talked about how he was a demolition expert.
[1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:29.560]  He used the analogy of propane and kerosene.
[1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:32.160]  It was just great because you can't attack Jesse Ventura.
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:33.880]  It's very hard to attack him.
[1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:34.880]  They were very friendly to him.
[1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:36.280]  I was pretty surprised.
[1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:42.640]  Well, the little clip I heard was Robin trying to deny going, well, those buildings had problems
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:45.520]  and, well, they collapsed because of an Easter Bunny.
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:47.240]  Let's be clear here.
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:51.320]  NIST has given five reasons it fell, and then they have retracted.
[1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:56.460]  Not the fuel tank, not bad construction, not melting steel, not weakening steel.
[1:10:56.460 --> 1:11:02.040]  They have now had to come in, not the tower falling, not the north tower falling into
[1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:03.040]  it.
[1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:04.200]  Turns out it only had some windows knocked out.
[1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:05.920]  Palmer Mechanics shows a fake photo.
[1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:07.920]  It's even gray building side.
[1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:10.000]  It's not the red building side, brick red.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:11.520]  They show the World Financial Center.
[1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:12.800]  They won't even show the right building.
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:15.040]  I mean, that's the type of scams they engage in.
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:19.240]  You know, they say NORAD never intercepted anybody in the year before 9-11.
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:20.240]  Total lie.
[1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:23.640]  We have Reuters with the head of it saying 160 something times the year before.
[1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:27.240]  I mean, it's just the deception of our enemies.
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:31.080]  It's like they're now saying we're lying and there weren't Pentagon videos and others
[1:11:31.080 --> 1:11:32.920]  confiscated by the FBI.
[1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:35.360]  When it's all admitted, they won't release those tapes.
[1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:36.360]  But it doesn't matter.
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:37.360]  The public's weak minded.
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:39.360]  They just show video and say, we're lying.
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:43.960]  I mean, this is the level of this, or they bring out black propaganda, and that's where
[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:50.680]  you, going back to JFK folks, he would have cops and FBI and coroners who were going to
[1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:51.680]  testify.
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:56.440]  It's totally normal, 30, 40 year careers, totally normal, 25 year careers.
[1:11:56.440 --> 1:11:58.720]  And they get up on stand and say, I am a space alien.
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:02.440]  Or they get up on stand and say, I fingerprint my daughter every day to make sure they haven't,
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:03.440]  you know, taken her.
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:08.640]  I'm a fingerprinting expert and then go, you know, I mean, that's what they do.
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:12.880]  And so Stern is having black propaganda on to, I mean, if I wanted to have him over a
[1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:13.880]  barrel, I could.
[1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:17.880]  My God, the slander is just, just the worst stuff they can say is being said, then they
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:21.280]  have Ventura on and I haven't had a chance to hear it all yet.
[1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:25.800]  Let's go ahead and play a few minutes of this to analyze into me propaganda.
[1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:26.800]  Here it is.
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:31.080]  Hey, you're one of those guys who believes that, you know, that 9-Eleven, that you don't
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:33.800]  believe two planes knocked down three buildings, right?
[1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:39.280]  Well, I, I, I believed it when it happened and then after I got out of office, my son
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:43.000]  kept badgering me to pay attention to these things on the internet.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:47.920]  And I finally did and I started studying it and I started opening my eyes a little.
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:51.960]  And there's a lot of very difficult questions that have not been answered and no one seems
[1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:53.440]  to want to provide an answer.
[1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:55.320]  What's the most difficult question that you see?
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:13:00.320]  Well, that a third building could fall into its own footprint five hours later having
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:02.240]  not been struck by much of anything.
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:03.480]  So what do you think happened?
[1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:04.480]  One story's high.
[1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:05.480]  How did that happen?
[1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:08.400]  The 9-Eleven commission didn't even address the issue.
[1:13:08.400 --> 1:13:10.280]  So what do you think happened?
[1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:15.960]  Um, I hate to fear what could have happened that possibly we did it to ourselves.
[1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:16.960]  You're kidding me.
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:22.320]  Well, Howard, I worked in demolition first and was trained by the best guys in the United
[1:13:22.320 --> 1:13:27.080]  States Navy being a frog man and what, how could those buildings fall at the rate of
[1:13:27.080 --> 1:13:28.080]  gravity?
[1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:29.360]  Well, let me ask you something.
[1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:34.960]  It seems to me, I don't know much about this, but when jets go right into a, into a building,
[1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:38.840]  couldn't there be so, so much trauma to the area that things can fall?
[1:13:38.840 --> 1:13:39.840]  Yeah.
[1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:44.040]  No, because if you study how they built the buildings, those buildings were made to withstand
[1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:48.160]  a 707, which is that old plane with the four engines on the wing.
[1:13:48.160 --> 1:13:49.160]  Right.
[1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:51.160]  Well, that's as big as what hit it.
[1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:56.040]  And by my studying, they said it was built to where if a plane penetrated it, it would
[1:13:56.040 --> 1:13:58.760]  be like a pencil going through a screen door.
[1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:03.080]  But it seems unthinkable to me that our own government, I mean, I mean, this would be...
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:04.080]  Nothing's unthinkable.
[1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:05.080]  Don't you?
[1:14:05.080 --> 1:14:06.800]  You're talking about power.
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:10.880]  You're talking about foreign policy changing over this event.
[1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:14.280]  You're talking about getting control of the Middle Eastern oil.
[1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:16.600]  Do you think Bush is smart enough to pull off something like that?
[1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:17.600]  Oh, please.
[1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:18.600]  He is.
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:19.600]  Hit pause for a minute.
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:20.600]  Hit pause.
[1:14:20.600 --> 1:14:21.600]  Back it up.
[1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:24.200]  Again, we all have blind spots.
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:25.640]  And I have had Ventura on.
[1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:28.840]  He broke that he's on 11 Truth or On This Show a month and a half ago.
[1:14:28.840 --> 1:14:30.600]  And then they said they wanted to come back on.
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:34.280]  They knew it had a great response and he likes the films and what we do.
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:36.880]  And so I get him back on and he says, oh man, they're really attacking me.
[1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:39.880]  And then the one question, because I was thinking the night before, what do I ask?
[1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:41.200]  And I wrote some notes here.
[1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:42.760]  The one question was, well, who did it?
[1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:43.760]  Why'd they do it?
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:44.760]  You know, what's the motive?
[1:14:44.760 --> 1:14:47.960]  And of course, I talked about that with him two years ago in an interview where he said
[1:14:47.960 --> 1:14:51.240]  they might have done it, where he first started to talk.
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:52.400]  That was even before he'd seen loose change.
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:55.840]  I pushed him over the edge and I gave him some of my films.
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:14:59.640]  But I was literally waking up last night mad that I hadn't asked that question.
[1:14:59.640 --> 1:15:02.640]  And then thank God, he just says it on stern so we now have it.
[1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:03.920]  And then he brought the insurance thing.
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:08.000]  This is going to go crazy.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.920]  Our government may have done 9-11, that's the headline.
[1:15:10.920 --> 1:15:13.520]  Another headline, insurance fraud.
[1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:18.080]  We need multiple articles, attack pattern, Delta, tying in the video we got him a few
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:21.440]  days ago and the audio we've got here with all of it.
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:25.760]  And then challenging, we need articles because new people are going to be seeing this that
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:32.120]  go through it all and that show what Jesse's saying and show Building 7 and show the designers
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:36.640]  and builders saying about how I could take two fully loaded jets, not one.
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:39.840]  Yeah, they said two of those big jumbo jets.
[1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:45.960]  So we need to show all that, we need to show how NIST admits that bombs, they're now looking
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:49.080]  at bombs for two years and they keep saying, we'll release it in a month, we'll release
[1:15:49.080 --> 1:15:50.080]  it in a month.
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:53.360]  They'll never release what brought it down because they scientifically know.
[1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:57.400]  Now there have been scientific papers published in scientific procedures journals that are
[1:15:57.400 --> 1:15:59.480]  accredited saying, yeah, it had to be bombs.
[1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:01.160]  I mean, Burmese, what are they going to do?
[1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:05.040]  Well, what they're going to try to do with Building 7 is go by their pattern where they're
[1:16:05.040 --> 1:16:09.560]  not allowed to look at floors below, I believe it's either the 11th or the 7th floor at all.
[1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:12.920]  And we know that's where a lot of the damage on the front side of the building was.
[1:16:12.920 --> 1:16:17.200]  We also know that the eyewitnesses that were inside the building that were blown up on the
[1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:21.440]  8th floor said that there were multiple explosions inside the building.
[1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:24.080]  So what they're going to do is they're going to take that 8th floor and bring it down and
[1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:27.520]  never even mention those and they're going to say something happened on the 9th or 10th
[1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:32.440]  floor that caused instability in the building that probably caused those fuel tanks to go
[1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:33.440]  up.
[1:16:33.440 --> 1:16:37.400]  And I believe there was also a large, what is it, power generator there, too.
[1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:39.800]  I'm sure that's going to fit into play as well.
[1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:43.320]  But here we are, Alice Rommel, seven years later, still no NIST report.
[1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:47.760]  And the guy that's heading this NIST report, I think it's Sonder or something or other,
[1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:48.760]  this scientist.
[1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:53.600]  He's the guy that went to Popular Mechanics and said 25% or 10 stories of the building
[1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:55.320]  was actually scooped out.
[1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:57.080]  You can quote that from the article.
[1:16:57.080 --> 1:16:58.920]  It's just totally made up.
[1:16:58.920 --> 1:17:02.120]  It's just, that's like saying Godzilla ate the building.
[1:17:02.120 --> 1:17:03.120]  It just didn't happen.
[1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:04.120]  Absolutely.
[1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:05.120]  And we have the video to prove it.
[1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:08.000]  We literally have the video after at least one of the buildings has collapsed of the
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:09.240]  south face of the building.
[1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:11.640]  Some of the glass is blown out, but some of the doors are still there.
[1:17:11.640 --> 1:17:15.680]  Then they go inside and they literally go through the lobby up into the second floor.
[1:17:15.680 --> 1:17:17.680]  In fact, that footage is in Truth Rising.
[1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:20.480]  And I think you're going to show some of that in your film.
[1:17:20.480 --> 1:17:23.560]  And there they are, the facade of the building with a few windows broken out.
[1:17:23.560 --> 1:17:25.840]  And they show a gray-sided building.
[1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:27.880]  The building was brick red.
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:32.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, they show the World Financial Center.
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:34.000]  I mean, these people are incredible.
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  Yeah.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:38.520]  And when we asked them, when we did our debate with Piper the Mechanics, where they got that
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:42.840]  photograph from or why they were able to see photographs that still weren't public,
[1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:43.840]  and we hadn't seen them.
[1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:44.840]  Oh yeah, they've been saying that.
[1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:45.840]  We've been shown secret photos.
[1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:46.840]  Yeah.
[1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:48.640]  We've been shown photos that no one else is allowed to see.
[1:17:48.640 --> 1:17:49.640]  Why?
[1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:50.640]  What's the big deal?
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:51.640]  Why isn't all this stuff public?
[1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:54.360]  If they have pictures that we don't have, why not show the public?
[1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:57.480]  Well, look, I had firefighters months after it happened, sitting at my desk with hundreds
[1:17:57.480 --> 1:17:58.480]  of high-res.
[1:17:58.480 --> 1:17:59.480]  Some of those are in the film.
[1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:01.280]  We even put some on the web a few years ago.
[1:18:01.280 --> 1:18:08.360]  These are giant government cameras, even back then, they were the huge pixels, 10, 20 megapixel,
[1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:09.360]  whatever.
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:11.760]  I mean, just high quality for seven years ago.
[1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:14.560]  And you see it, and it's got some windows out.
[1:18:14.560 --> 1:18:18.640]  After the other, it shows other buildings on fire, some of the smaller ones that got
[1:18:18.640 --> 1:18:19.800]  crushed but didn't fall.
[1:18:19.800 --> 1:18:24.960]  And in World War II, the Russians coming into Berlin would attack old buildings with
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:28.960]  giant artillery and aircraft for days, and they wouldn't collapse.
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:30.320]  The facade was still up.
[1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:34.960]  I mean, you don't just, like, have a fuel oil tank go off, and then everything symmetrically
[1:18:34.960 --> 1:18:35.960]  collapses perfectly.
[1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:36.960]  Let's go back to the tape.
[1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:42.520]  I think there are people capable of doing it, and I'm not saying that it didn't happen
[1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:43.520]  at all.
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:47.920]  I'm saying is that, take jet fuel, for example, it's kerosene.
[1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:51.160]  Kerosene doesn't burn very hot.
[1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:57.280]  They're telling us that a kerosene-based fuel melted these steel concrete girders in a giant
[1:18:57.280 --> 1:19:04.120]  building, so it would simply collapse to the ground, and it collapsed in all powder.
[1:19:04.120 --> 1:19:06.440]  Wouldn't it come down in big chunks?
[1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:10.640]  The thing is, is the fire caused the comms to weaken, and the sagging floors is what
[1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:11.640]  we call it.
[1:19:11.640 --> 1:19:12.640]  That's the case.
[1:19:12.640 --> 1:19:18.640]  OK, if that's the case, if you use that analogy, then when you go camping and use a propane
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:24.920]  stove, which propane burns hotter than kerosene does, if you leave it on for two hours and
[1:19:24.920 --> 1:19:29.760]  you put a big can of beans on your grill, shouldn't the grill collapse?
[1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:30.760]  See that, Fred?
[1:19:30.760 --> 1:19:34.520]  Shouldn't another weaken to the point where the weight of the beans on the grill...
[1:19:34.520 --> 1:19:36.920]  It's not that much weight, and it's not that much heat.
[1:19:36.920 --> 1:19:38.440]  Stay there, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:39.440]  Stay there.
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:42.440]  Now, a propane stove is hotter than jet fuel.
[1:19:42.440 --> 1:19:45.560]  We'll be right back to include with this huge news.
[1:19:45.560 --> 1:19:47.800]  The insurance fraud clip is coming up.
[1:19:47.800 --> 1:19:48.800]  Stay with us.
[1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:52.040]  It is blowing wide open.
[1:19:52.040 --> 1:19:55.920]  It is now time to rein in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:19:55.920 --> 1:20:00.840]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:20:00.840 --> 1:20:05.520]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the
[1:20:05.520 --> 1:20:06.520]  U.S.
[1:20:06.520 --> 1:20:11.120]  Though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary responsibility
[1:20:11.120 --> 1:20:15.360]  for reigning the men and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since
[1:20:15.360 --> 1:20:17.280]  they reside the world over.
[1:20:17.280 --> 1:20:21.680]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:24.480]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:20:24.480 --> 1:20:28.320]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[1:20:28.320 --> 1:20:31.960]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power
[1:20:31.960 --> 1:20:37.040]  they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind,
[1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:41.240]  we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[1:20:41.240 --> 1:20:44.920]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[1:20:44.920 --> 1:20:51.120]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G, them.com, the message of His Kingdom.
[1:20:51.120 --> 1:20:55.280]  As the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[1:20:55.280 --> 1:20:57.680]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:02.840]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many
[1:21:02.840 --> 1:21:05.880]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[1:21:05.880 --> 1:21:09.480]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:14.120]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:17.840]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:19.120]  from Jekyll Island.
[1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:23.240]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[1:21:23.240 --> 1:21:28.120]  power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[1:21:28.120 --> 1:21:29.640]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[1:24:23.120 --> 1:24:30.240]  Let's go back to this clip of Howard Stern and Jesse Ventura as we analyze the way they
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:31.840]  try to counter him.
[1:24:31.840 --> 1:24:32.840]  Here it is.
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:37.840]  See that, Fred?
[1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:38.840]  It's not that much heat.
[1:24:38.840 --> 1:24:39.840]  It's not that much heat.
[1:24:39.840 --> 1:24:40.840]  I don't eat beans.
[1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:47.840]  Well, the point I'm saying is these buildings would not collapse in that manner.
[1:24:47.840 --> 1:24:48.840]  Gee, I mean, I...
[1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:49.840]  See, that's crazy.
[1:24:49.840 --> 1:24:50.840]  This is crazy.
[1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:54.960]  Like, even when you say that the planes were made to go through a certain way, you've
[1:24:54.960 --> 1:24:58.200]  never seen anything that was built to work a certain way, but you never know until something
[1:24:58.200 --> 1:24:59.200]  happens.
[1:24:59.200 --> 1:25:02.920]  It's also in the report that they did not build...
[1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:04.920]  I know.
[1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:07.160] ...but they didn't build the buildings to code.
[1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:11.040]  They scripted and they didn't do everything that was supposed to do.
[1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:12.040]  Hit pause.
[1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:13.040]  Hit pause.
[1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:14.040]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:16.520]  Again, NISTAS said they looked at it.
[1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:18.200]  They were built to code.
[1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:20.240]  They were underwritten by underwriting laboratories.
[1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:23.200]  They internally did their own test and found it had to be bombs.
[1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:26.080]  When Kevin Ryan released that, he got fired.
[1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:29.080]  So just more bull from these people.
[1:25:29.080 --> 1:25:32.840]  Well, you know, we're planning this as a public service to show you the deception of these
[1:25:32.840 --> 1:25:33.840]  individuals.
[1:25:33.840 --> 1:25:35.840]  Burmese, you got comments to that?
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:36.840]  Yeah.
[1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:39.560]  Underwriters' laboratory certified the steel structure.
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:45.800]  In other words, they had four models there after the fact also that did not collapse,
[1:25:45.800 --> 1:25:46.800]  Alex.
[1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:50.560]  They subjected them to higher temperatures for longer periods of time, and the best
[1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:53.280]  they could do was have them sag.
[1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:54.560]  It's an utter lie.
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:55.560]  We know that...
[1:25:55.560 --> 1:25:57.400]  You know, I've heard that before.
[1:25:57.400 --> 1:25:59.440]  The buildings weren't brought to code.
[1:25:59.440 --> 1:26:01.200]  It's a total fabrication.
[1:26:01.200 --> 1:26:06.160]  And the disturbing part is I've heard that come out of some of the 9-11 truthers, or
[1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:11.040]  supposed 9-11 truthers' mouths, that this was mafia bill and the concrete was light
[1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:14.000]  and it was lightweight steel in the core, or that there's no core at all.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.160]  I'm sure you've heard that one, Alex.
[1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:22.440]  Oh, they engage in just every form of deception you can imagine.
[1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:23.440]  Let's finish up with a clip.
[1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:24.440]  I know.
[1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:26.080]  Yeah, but they didn't build the buildings to code.
[1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:30.280]  They scripted and they didn't do everything they was supposed to do.
[1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:32.880]  These two buildings were white elephants.
[1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:34.880]  They were losing money.
[1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:40.800]  They had asbestos in there, and they were being required by law to do over a billion
[1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:43.960]  dollars worth of asbestos removal.
[1:26:43.960 --> 1:26:46.960]  So you think somebody might have sabotaged them?
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:47.960]  Just for that, they're not doing it.
[1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:48.960]  It was an insurance job?
[1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:49.960]  Wow.
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:54.840]  They insured them against rules and attacks and made $7 billion of which he settled for
[1:26:54.840 --> 1:26:55.840]  four.
[1:26:55.840 --> 1:26:57.200]  You might have to read your book.
[1:26:57.200 --> 1:26:58.200]  You might have to.
[1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:00.720]  It's called Don't Start the Revolution Without Me.
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:04.800]  It's in stores now by Jesse Ventura, Governor Jesse Ventura.
[1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:07.920]  And you even believe, you're one of those guys, you don't even believe that Lee Harvey
[1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:10.120]  Oswald acted alone again in the Kennedy assassination.
[1:27:10.120 --> 1:27:13.160]  No, I do not because I've studied it for over 20 years.
[1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:14.160]  Stop right there.
[1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:15.560]  Back it up again.
[1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:17.200]  Okay.
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:22.400]  In every major poll, it is now over 90% of Americans believe the government killed Kennedy.
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:27.040]  They've now come out on the BBC and NBC showing the film footage at the Ambassador Hotel of
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:30.640]  three CIA section chiefs from Asia.
[1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:34.320]  The famous guys involved with Kennedy with JFK as well.
[1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:43.080]  It's admitted that the guy that shot RFK behind him, who the coroner said shot him from behind,
[1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:48.200]  Mr. Caesar was CIA, and we have the footage of all these guys there directing Caesar and
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:50.480]  others right before it happens.
[1:27:50.480 --> 1:27:56.240]  We now have the son releasing the video we have at the audio of the guy that was photographed
[1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:00.160]  being at the scene by the Dallas Morning News and Dallas Times Herald, and that of course
[1:28:00.160 --> 1:28:01.160]  E. Howard Hunt.
[1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:03.720]  I mean, Jason, when does it end?
[1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:04.720]  It doesn't end.
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:09.280]  I mean, that interview is almost over and they ridicule him for believing that Oswald
[1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:12.080]  was not the lone assassin after he's off the air.
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:16.680]  But just go to the videotape of the Secret Service by Kennedy that day as they're turning
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:18.360]  the corner at Dealey Plaza.
[1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:22.400]  One of the Secret Service agents at the back of his car actually gets called off and he's
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:24.040]  not happy about it, Alex.
[1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:26.560]  He starts yelling and saying, no, I'm not going to do it.
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:29.840]  No, somebody ought to get this video online and add that video over it.
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:32.440]  Our great listeners, we don't have the personnel, but you can take it and put it all together
[1:28:32.440 --> 1:28:33.440]  for folks.
[1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:36.520]  And it shows a couple of them actually going, what are you saying?
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:39.440]  And then later they later said that all procedures were blocked.
[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:43.320]  You got LBJ behind them in the radio calling in the assault, get ready, we're going with
[1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:47.640]  sniper position one because they had kill zones all the way down to the airport.
[1:28:47.640 --> 1:28:50.440]  They were going to keep, keep, you know, I mean, they, they were ready with hangar
[1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:52.240]  Nate attacks, bazooka attacks.
[1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:55.960]  If they had to, they were going to have military kill him and go to full martial law.
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:29:01.760]  They had riot troops in the air from the army flying above Dallas and hours before Oswald's
[1:29:01.760 --> 1:29:02.760]  name came out.
[1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:06.640]  When the police were first, you know, minutes after he's, uh, uh, Kennedy's killed, it's
[1:29:06.640 --> 1:29:11.280]  already published in New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, that Lee Harvey Oswald did it.
[1:29:11.280 --> 1:29:12.280]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:29:12.280 --> 1:29:13.280]  Open and shut.
[1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:15.440]  I mean, just like they announced building seven blew up before it blew up.
[1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:16.440]  Absolutely.
[1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:19.840]  So Jonathan Elanoff from we are changed Colorado has that.
[1:29:19.840 --> 1:29:20.840]  He got it from eBay.
[1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:25.200]  He's got the cover paper where they're literally blaming Oswald for the assassination before
[1:29:25.200 --> 1:29:26.200]  it happens.
[1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:30.640]  I mean, think, think for yourselves, people, if they can print this before an event, it's
[1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:32.240]  obviously not that guy.
[1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:33.560]  They got their time zones off.
[1:29:33.560 --> 1:29:34.560]  Yeah.
[1:29:34.560 --> 1:29:35.560]  I mean, they're going to make mistakes.
[1:29:35.560 --> 1:29:36.560]  The government's not perfect.
[1:29:36.560 --> 1:29:37.560]  They're not invincible.
[1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:38.560]  Barma, thanks for coming in.
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:39.560]  Thank you.
[1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:41.920]  Well, let's talk during this break.
[1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:49.280]  Here on the March, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:29:49.280 --> 1:29:56.040]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing vaccines
[1:29:56.040 --> 1:29:59.760]  included medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[1:29:59.760 --> 1:30:04.600]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually with a worst
[1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:06.600]  toll taken by antibiotics.
[1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:10.960]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret oxy silver developed
[1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:16.240]  by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making
[1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:21.640]  deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete, taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural
[1:30:21.640 --> 1:30:24.040]  immunity without drug toxicity.
[1:30:24.040 --> 1:30:27.040]  Oxy silver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[1:30:27.040 --> 1:30:32.040]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds,
[1:30:32.040 --> 1:30:37.320]  flus, cancers and more, build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely
[1:30:37.320 --> 1:30:40.000]  and inexpensively with oxy silver.
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:45.960]  Here you're supplying now by calling toll free 1-877-817-9829.

[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:06.560]  It's known as the Bilderberg group, both their objective being world domination.
[1:31:06.560 --> 1:31:11.960]  For thousands of years their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world
[1:31:11.960 --> 1:31:20.080]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[1:32:00.400 --> 1:32:01.760]  from all walks of life.
[1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:06.840]  The balance bracelet not only looks good, it performs beyond most people's expectations.

[1:32:10.120 --> 1:32:13.440]  Ask someone who wears one, or better yet, try one for yourself.
[1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:17.520]  The silver band with gold terminals is still the most popular and a best seller.

[1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:31.840]  I am the man of constant sorrow, I've seen trouble all my day, I bid farewell to Wolf
[1:33:31.840 --> 1:34:00.320]  Rucky, the place where I was born and raised, the place where he was born and raised.
[1:34:00.320 --> 1:34:11.520]  Welcome back folks, this is very, very exciting, Jesse Ventura a month and a half ago out
[1:34:11.520 --> 1:34:16.560]  of the blue went public saying 9-11 was an inside job on my show, he said, yeah, two
[1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:19.840]  years ago when you gave me your videos, I wasn't quite convinced, I knew they'd stage
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:24.800]  other events, I go to the Tonkin and see Northwoods, and that's in my film, of course, Terror
[1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:29.840]  Storm, but he said, now I'm ready to go public, I've read 16 books and watch loose change
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:33.680]  and I agree with you, and that's actually at the end of my new film, first time folks
[1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:37.360]  saw that was at two movie showings we did, the off the air discussions between me and
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:45.680]  Ventura, we're going to be posting those up on the web soon.
[1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:50.560]  This is life and death, if we don't expose the criminal element stage the attacks, it's
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:54.520]  over, they're going to do it more, they're going to win, they're going to use the FEMA
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:59.360]  camps, it's all going to happen, this is life and death for this republic, and we've
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:05.680]  got a story about Ventura up on PrisonPlanet.com, Ventura slams media witch hunt for Question
[1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:09.200]  911, there's one that Nemo did last night, there's two more about to go up in the next
[1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:14.320]  hour on Prison Planet and Info Wars, one with Ventura talks about insurance fraud to destroy
[1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:19.480]  the buildings and get rid of the asbestos, and he said, it looks like our government
[1:35:19.480 --> 1:35:23.200]  did it, he said, it looks like we did it, and he explained that he's a demolitions
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:28.120]  expert in underwater demolitions, so we did it before he was in Navy Seal, those guys
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:34.040]  are highly trained and that's what it is, and this needs to get out folks, we need,
[1:35:34.040 --> 1:35:38.200]  this is big, we need to make sure the mainstream media is forced to attack him, he told me
[1:35:38.200 --> 1:35:40.200]  privately, he said, I know they're going to attack me, but at least they'll bring the
[1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:44.480]  truth out, and I might even take those behind the scenes things, just put them up, and I
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:50.000]  tell him, may we're recording this during the breaks and I talk to him more, but we
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:55.640]  just really, really need to get this information out, and I'm asking you listeners to not play
[1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:59.960]  games, to not stand by, to not screw around, we also need funds, and I hope you'll support
[1:35:59.960 --> 1:36:05.520]  our sponsors, I also hope you'll sign up for the Money Bomb, I mean, I know we'll use
[1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:11.440]  the money, 100% my pledge to fight the New World Order, go to infowarsmoneybomb.com,
[1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:15.640]  I didn't think the idea up, a listener did the same guy that originally came up with
[1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:19.400]  the idea, put up the first website that Trevor Lyman picked up on it, this is separate from
[1:36:19.400 --> 1:36:27.720]  Trevor Lyman in that group, and this is what Mr. Nordstrom put up, and it's about $46,000
[1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:32.040]  been pledged there, you know, I mean, if Ron Paul can raise $15 million off Money Bombs,
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:38.200]  I wish we could raise a million, because my pledge is, I would spend that to go to the
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:44.240]  next level immediately, I mean, I would put up our own servers for unlimited video uploading
[1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:49.880]  and streaming out, I mean, with that for a couple years I could rival YouTube, I mean,
[1:36:49.880 --> 1:36:55.680]  it would really, the amount of bandwidth we could buy with that, the studio, the TV show
[1:36:55.680 --> 1:37:01.000]  we could develop, I mean, fast, I could do stuff quick, I'd hire two more IT guys, I'd
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:08.120]  hire three or four camera people, PR people, you know, for setting up interviews, producers,
[1:37:08.120 --> 1:37:12.320]  but I don't have the money to do that, so it'll end up being about 11 of us that are
[1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:15.720]  actually in the fight against the New World Order here, doing the work of tens of thousands
[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:21.120]  because of you, the listeners taking action, so sign up for InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:24.440]  That's next Saturday, not this Saturday, but next Saturday, that's the day they chose,
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:28.480]  I would probably chose a Friday or a Wednesday or so, but they did other Money Bombs on
[1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:34.720]  the weekend, so my commitment, 100% my word of the money will go to fight the New World
[1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:35.720]  Order.
[1:37:35.720 --> 1:37:40.240]  I know that's hard for the average person to believe, but I'm completely unworldly,
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:46.120]  ladies and gentlemen, I've been very, quote, manly, I'm married, I have three children,
[1:37:46.120 --> 1:37:51.320]  I like women a lot, I love my wife, but I'm not even into that anymore, all I think about
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:58.600]  is this, I mean, I am completely dedicated, I am just constant, this is all I am, this
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:38:04.960]  is who I am, and we need your support, and I know the Money Bombs, the Ron Paul Stars
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:08.600]  kind of faded, done a lot of great work, woke a lot of people up, so the idea of Money Bombs
[1:38:08.600 --> 1:38:14.240]  kind of hooked to that pony, but this is exciting, and what this could do for other
[1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:19.800]  activist groups, so I'm asking you to go pledge $5, $10, $100, whatever, and you have my word
[1:38:19.800 --> 1:38:22.600]  that we'll fight the New World Order with it, we need your support, or if you just want
[1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:27.600]  to write me a check and say it's for the Money Bombs, 100% we'll go to fight the New World
[1:38:27.600 --> 1:38:33.560]  Order, and I'll live off my meager video sales and the other things I do, but you have my
[1:38:33.560 --> 1:38:39.240]  commitment that 100%, no other charity does that, of course it's not tax exempt either,
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:43.640]  we're not under government control, it'll end up spending on equipment and buildings
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:48.440]  and things, so tax man won't get much of it, that's the good news, is that the tax
[1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:52.600]  man won't get any of it really, because I'll spend it all on equipment and personnel,
[1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:55.840]  they will get money, the government will get some of the money through the taxes that my
[1:38:55.840 --> 1:39:00.320]  employees pay, because we do pay the government taxes to the IRS, to the Federal Reserve,
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:06.580]  because we're choosing our battles here, we're not, I commend those that don't pay the taxes
[1:39:06.580 --> 1:39:11.600]  and protest it, I'm saying we pick our battles, I can be like Wesley Snipes going off to prison
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:17.640]  for three years or whatever, okay let's shift gears now to Marty the soap man, we have a
[1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:23.760]  couple of our top sponsors on once a month, and Marty Schachter is that man, he was in
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:31.120]  the Chemical Corps in World War II, his father and he in 1947 started Calvin Pure Soap, I'd
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:36.280]  seen it in one nice hotel I was in once in D.C. with my parents, I had seen it at a hospital
[1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:40.440]  once, they only sold to institutions until Genesis, got them to advertise five, six
[1:39:40.440 --> 1:39:44.640]  years ago, as you're getting factory direct from Oakland, California, it's why you save
[1:39:44.640 --> 1:39:50.440]  85% off supermarket prices, and Marty let me ask you out of the gates, with this fine
[1:39:50.440 --> 1:39:58.000]  organic soap, that's a last year's number of 85% off, do you save even more now because
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:02.720]  there's the middleman taken out and all the added double triple shipping back and forth
[1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:06.680]  going on or is it still 85% off that people save?
[1:40:06.680 --> 1:40:12.600]  Well first I want to thank you for talking to me and giving me the opportunity to talk
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:20.480]  to your listeners, but I have in my hands statistical evidence proving what it costs
[1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:28.320]  the consumer now in the marketplace, and the evidence reads somewhere between 17 cents
[1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:35.840]  and 20.8 cents of every dollar is spent on a cleaning product in the marketplace.
[1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:42.560]  Now figuring out a minimum that a family could spend like $100 a week, which is a $1900
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:50.640]  figure, $100 a week for everything they need in the marketplace, approximately 20% of that
[1:40:50.640 --> 1:40:55.120]  goes for cleaning products, for bath soap and hair soap and dish soap and laundry soap
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:59.560]  and all purpose cleaner and floor cleaner, window cleaner, an endless array of cleaning
[1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:07.560]  chemicals, so if they're spending $20 a week, that adds up to over $1,000 a year going down
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:09.640]  to drain with nothing to show for it.
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:13.480]  Well I mean here's an example, I know a lot of vets, I work for a small animal vet, large
[1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:18.320]  animal vet for several years total, and I remember them complaining 15, 16, 17 years
[1:41:18.320 --> 1:41:24.520]  ago, I guess longer than that, I guess in one case, 20 years ago, man I'm getting old,
[1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:29.360]  and you know when I work for them, and they would talk about hey, these vaccines are good
[1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:33.800]  for five years, eight years, the rabies shot good for nine to 12 depending on which type
[1:41:33.800 --> 1:41:38.400]  it is, why do they make them give it each year, and it's a money maker, it's the same
[1:41:38.400 --> 1:41:42.960]  thing, I read all the studies about how you need a thimble of soap to clean clothes, but
[1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:49.240]  so they use masses of toxic detergents, they've built in fraud and trained us how to live
[1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:51.760]  in a fraud.
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:57.920]  I want to give you a counter to that $20 a week consumer spending in round figures, if
[1:41:57.920 --> 1:42:04.080]  he bought from, we offer a one year supply which could last an average family anywhere
[1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:08.800]  from 12 to 24 months for $145.
[1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:16.400]  On top of that, we add $45 for shipping coast to coast, 3,000 miles, obviously if you're
[1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:24.880]  1,500 miles or 1,800 miles or 1,000 miles, it's much lower, but a total maximum cost
[1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:33.880]  of $190 for a year versus the difference of $1,000 a year that gives you over an 80%
[1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:40.120]  savings, over that, because we have to calculate the difference in the shipping, no sales
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:41.120]  tax.
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:45.640]  Now that is statistical evidence, we can prove that unequivocally.
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:54.920]  Now it doesn't take to be a rocket scientist to divide $190 total into 52 weeks, that comes
[1:42:54.920 --> 1:43:03.840]  out to $3.65 a week if it lasts you 12 months, if it lasts you 24 months, half of that.
[1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:11.480]  That's per week, compare that to the $20 or more spending in the supermarket for chemicals.
[1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:17.520]  We offer products that are twice as good as what you're buying now, triple concentrated,
[1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:23.080]  all natural and earth friendly, there's not another company in the country that offers
[1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:24.080]  this deal.
[1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:28.320]  But again, we are habitualized to go to the store, to go down the aisle, it makes our
[1:43:28.320 --> 1:43:35.320]  eyes run, to buy all this toxic waste, and the reason we got back on organics was I've
[1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:40.680]  been using Calben I guess about four years, but we would wash the baby even with so-called
[1:43:40.680 --> 1:43:45.220]  store baby soaps and make him get rashes, and then once we went and bought more expensive,
[1:43:45.220 --> 1:43:48.840]  some of the organics wouldn't do it, some would, we'd find out even the quote organics
[1:43:48.840 --> 1:43:54.400]  had the sulfates and salts and stuff, the Calben soap with our babies, just absolutely
[1:43:54.400 --> 1:43:55.400]  amazing.
[1:43:55.400 --> 1:43:59.320]  It works, again, Michael Trudeau, who used to be the sales manager at Genesis, I told
[1:43:59.320 --> 1:44:03.640]  the story about four years ago, mails me a box of this and says, man, you got to interview
[1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:07.360]  this guy, you got to have him on, he's a great sponsor, and I'm like, yeah, whatever, blah,
[1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:10.600]  blah, blah, and then my wife runs out of the earth supply in a year, what a great gift
[1:44:10.600 --> 1:44:11.600]  you gave us, Marty.
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:15.440]  I'm so busy, I'm like soap, that's for the woman, you know, I'm the male shoving this
[1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:17.320]  pig, I'm not involved in all this.
[1:44:17.320 --> 1:44:21.040]  She's like, I want more, I want this, what is this?
[1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:24.080]  And I'm like, she goes, and I'm like, yeah, I do like how it smells, boy, that bar soap
[1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:30.840]  smells so good with that sherry and almond oil in it, but I mean, here's an example.
[1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:34.440]  Sometimes I run out of Calben soap, my wife's got the fancier soap, she still uses some
[1:44:34.440 --> 1:44:39.480]  other stuff, I'll wash with some soap, get a little bit under my arms, happened to happen
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:43.800]  yesterday, and I'm like, man, I got to get more of my Calben soap because other stuff
[1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:47.160]  comes into the house, we don't just use that exclusively, women like to buy other stuff
[1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:52.160]  at the store, and it burned me because I ended up taking a quick shower because I'm such
[1:44:52.160 --> 1:44:54.360]  a hurry to leave it under my arms.
[1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:58.760]  And that happened yesterday, I was in the office bathroom splashing water during breaks
[1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:01.840]  because everybody knows the soap sits there and then burns you, and I always tell that
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:08.120]  story, it happened yesterday, and I've just got to, again, the problem is calling, ordering
[1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:13.720]  it, the problem is getting it, we forget, we need to remember, Marty, tell folks about
[1:45:13.720 --> 1:45:14.720]  your product line.
[1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:24.480]  We make five basic soaps, four are pure soap, bath soap, air soap, dish soap, laundry soap,
[1:45:24.480 --> 1:45:29.640]  and a powder that goes in the automatic dishwasher, which is not a soap because you can't use
[1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:34.120]  a soap in an automatic dishwasher, it'll sud you out of the kitchen.
[1:45:34.120 --> 1:45:39.000]  But the four basic soaps will do 100 jobs, you don't have to buy all purpose cleaners,
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:43.640]  a window cleaner, a floor cleaner, and all the additives and chemicals and sprays and
[1:45:43.640 --> 1:45:49.040]  powders and bars, which by the way, aren't linked, they've been proven to cause asthma,
[1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:55.200]  cancer, skin allergies, I mean, I remember coming into the office when we had the maid
[1:45:55.200 --> 1:45:58.320]  service here, and I had to tell them to cut back on the amount of cleaner and we'd just
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:03.120]  breathe it and feel sick in it, it's like a stench.
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:10.360]  Perfumes are very harmful, we don't use perfumes, we use natural juices of almonds, of lemons,
[1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:15.680]  of coconuts to give it the essence, but it washes free and doesn't leave a residue in
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:16.680]  the air.
[1:46:16.680 --> 1:46:20.120]  Well again, I habitualize, I get in the habit of using the cheapest cleaning crew we can
[1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:23.520]  because we're too busy around here with cleaning crew comes once a week, that's it.
[1:46:23.520 --> 1:46:27.000]  I like the cleaning crew we got guys, but before I forget, get rid of them, even though
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:31.160]  it costs twice as much, get me an organic crew in here, and I want to read the bottles.
[1:46:31.160 --> 1:46:34.440]  See we're also busy with life, but I come in here, my eyes are burning when they've
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:38.720]  been here at night to work the extra shift, and then I'm like, oh God, the maids were
[1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:42.880]  here spraying everything with toxic garbage.
[1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:46.600]  We've got to think Marty, we've got to call you and get off this stuff.
[1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:52.240]  We offer a fresh start, we take the people out of coach and we put them into first class.
[1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:57.560]  Well it's no hype, it's no braggest fact as John Wayne would say, and Marty I'm telling
[1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:02.200]  you, you've got an amazing product and you've got a little tote bag that's got a sample
[1:47:02.200 --> 1:47:05.040]  of everything at cost, tell folks how they get that.
[1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:10.520]  Well they could get a year's supply and save themselves $1,000 immediately, or they can
[1:47:10.520 --> 1:47:16.160]  get a starter pack, a one month supply, which weighs out of six pounds, we ship it by United
[1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:20.080]  Parcel, we don't trust the post office, they break too much stuff.
[1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:21.080]  Oh yeah, they're horrible.
[1:47:21.080 --> 1:47:27.040]  United Parcel goes door to door, they automatically insure it for $20, you'll get yourself a one
[1:47:27.040 --> 1:47:33.880]  to two month supply of bath soap, air soap, dish soap, and laundry soap, a book of instructions,
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:39.040]  a tiny little measuring scoop, and you're going to change your life.
[1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:41.560]  Marty, give them the phone number, give them the website.
[1:47:41.560 --> 1:47:49.120]  What site is fivestarsoap.com, five to number or the letter fivestarsoap.com, we're waiting
[1:47:49.120 --> 1:48:01.840]  for you on that, you can call us toll free, 1-800-340-7091, 800-340-7091, our family is
[1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:08.080]  waiting for your call, we're not a big corporation, we're a small family owned company, you buy
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:14.920]  five factory direct, no middleman, no broker, no distributor, no jobber, no wholesaler,
[1:48:14.920 --> 1:48:18.320]  we eliminate them, so we keep our costs low.
[1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:24.920]  Fivestarsoap.com, five, that's the number five star soap.com, or Calvinpiersub.com banners
[1:48:24.920 --> 1:48:30.240]  up on jonesreport.com, infowars.com, presentplanet.com, if you forget the address, give them the
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:31.240]  number again Marty.
[1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:32.240]  800-340-7091.
[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:38.240]  Okay, shifting gears, give me a limerick.
[1:48:38.240 --> 1:48:46.080]  A limerick, packed, laughs, anatomical, it's a space that is quite economical, but the
[1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:53.720]  good ones I've seen, so seldom are clean, and the clean ones, so seldom are comical.
[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:57.560]  Oh man, Marty, thank you for joining us.
[1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:01.120]  Thank you Alex, I appreciate your calls, your consumers.
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:05.560]  Your ideas, everything you're doing, we love you over here at Cal Bend Soap.
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:07.280]  You guys are awesome, take care Marty.
[1:49:07.280 --> 1:49:08.280]  Thank you.
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:12.320]  What a character, they don't make them like that anymore as they say, and that one sponsor
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:18.840]  pays for an entire person here at this office every month, and it's a great product, win-win-win-win.
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:24.840]  I could probably build a castle if I was selling magic machines and magic pyramids and miracle
[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:29.560]  products, but I refuse to do it ladies and gentlemen, we just bring you well-known good
[1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:34.920]  vitamins, well-known organic soaps, well-known Second Amendment stuff, oh I'm dreaming, I
[1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:39.120]  don't have a Second Amendment sponsor, which we did, we're looking for one, survival type
[1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:49.760]  stuff or armament, defense, but point is, I believe in what I'm doing, and we have sponsors
[1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:53.640]  up here and there, thanks for putting up with it because that's what makes it all possible.
[1:49:53.640 --> 1:49:58.920]  We don't have General Electric and General Motors and Toyota and Procter and Gamble advertising
[1:49:58.920 --> 1:50:00.480]  here, and I wouldn't take them.
[1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:05.560]  I turned on advertising every day, what is it about crap that you can always get that
[1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:10.700]  and sell that, but some people don't want what's real, and let me tell you that Calvin
[1:50:10.700 --> 1:50:11.700]  said it was real.
[1:50:11.700 --> 1:50:15.000]  Okay, here's the deal, I got a bunch of news I want to blitz through in the next segment,
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:21.440]  then I got a guest in studio and another guest in the hour after that, I cannot overemphasize
[1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:25.960]  how important this Jesse Ventura second interview he did with us is, or the two articles about
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:29.560]  what he said on Howard Stern today about insurance fraud and the government being behind the
[1:50:29.560 --> 1:50:30.560]  attacks.
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:34.000]  Now, again, they picked the target, it's not for insurance fraud, but they went ahead
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:37.080]  and picked some where they could get insurance and get rid of a problem.
[1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:40.360]  It's cost benefit analysis, it's just why they chose that site.
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:44.000]  They attacked it to get our liberties and launch endless wars and turn us into slaves
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:45.400]  and they've done a very good job.
[1:50:45.400 --> 1:50:51.800]  We'll be right back, it's all up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:56.280]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes
[1:50:56.280 --> 1:51:02.520]  the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely
[1:51:02.520 --> 1:51:05.040]  destroys the official fable forever.
[1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:09.280]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:14.080]  family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[1:51:14.080 --> 1:51:16.040]  crime are brought to justice.
[1:51:16.040 --> 1:51:19.480]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[1:51:19.480 --> 1:51:23.920]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change
[1:51:23.920 --> 1:51:27.280]  Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:41.800]  films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds
[1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:42.800]  of other titles.
[1:51:42.800 --> 1:51:45.480]  We're in a no-olds bar information war.
[1:51:45.480 --> 1:51:50.160]  Truth is our weapon, and prismplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back
[1:51:50.160 --> 1:51:51.160]  to Big Brother.
[1:51:51.160 --> 1:51:55.720]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[1:51:55.720 --> 1:51:59.680]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at
[1:51:59.680 --> 1:52:00.680]  the pump.
[1:52:00.680 --> 1:52:04.720]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas
[1:52:04.720 --> 1:52:05.720]  mileage.
[1:52:05.720 --> 1:52:10.080]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a
[1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:15.320]  complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition.
[1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:17.240]  Clean mileage and only one tank full.
[1:52:17.240 --> 1:52:21.360]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your
[1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:22.360]  engine.
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:25.720]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[1:52:25.720 --> 1:52:30.200]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95, and receive a free engine
[1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:33.560]  treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[1:52:33.560 --> 1:52:35.840]  Call triple-8, use SFR-1.
[1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:43.040]  That number again is triple-8, use SFR-1, or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.

[1:54:15.400 --> 1:54:20.720]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, we've got Randy Kelton who has been kidnapped by Williamson
[1:54:20.720 --> 1:54:25.320]  County Police, you name it, very interesting fella, he went up there to file a complaint
[1:54:25.320 --> 1:54:32.240]  on him, so they just arrested him right there, I mean just insane lawlessness by government
[1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:37.720]  and he's been successful in filing criminal complaints on individuals and I wanted to
[1:54:37.720 --> 1:54:42.240]  get his take on what he'd do say in Kentucky with the press, given press passes, they asked
[1:54:42.240 --> 1:54:46.120]  all over North about concentration camps, which they got some hearings on, and the police
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:48.080]  come and tackle them and steal their equipment.
[1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:51.840]  So we'll get his take on all that, we also have a live video feed, we're going to be
[1:54:51.840 --> 1:54:58.440]  encoding liveprisonplanet.tv, viewers will be able to see with Randy Kelton coming up
[1:54:58.440 --> 1:54:59.960]  in the next hour.
[1:54:59.960 --> 1:55:06.240]  And then I'm not going to be on video in the fourth with Karen Johnson, because I've already
[1:55:06.240 --> 1:55:11.800]  done video with Burmese earlier, and I'll tell you flat out why, it's exhausting to
[1:55:11.800 --> 1:55:14.480]  be doing video in here and switching back and forth and doing the show and thinking
[1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:15.480]  about the news.
[1:55:15.480 --> 1:55:18.320]  I'm trying to limit it to about two hours of video a day, I think we did like three hours
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:22.160]  yesterday, and I felt like I'd been run over by a Mack truck at the end of it, there's
[1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:25.840]  a whole other dimension to video, and I'm in here switching things and running some
[1:55:25.840 --> 1:55:29.520]  things and I don't plan to be doing a very good job at it either.
[1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:35.920]  Before I start the next hour with Randy Kelton, who we really appreciate his fine work, I
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:39.960]  wanted to go over some of the news again, supply concern puts oil above $130 a barrel
[1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:44.240]  for the first time, we told you two years ago that they were going to bring it up to
[1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:47.920]  $200 according to their own documents in our moles, and our moles are good, I mean they
[1:55:47.920 --> 1:55:50.760]  tell us where the Bilderberg meetings are, they tell us when the Berlin Wall is going
[1:55:50.760 --> 1:55:55.360]  to be staged to fall, they tell us when the subprime is going to be artificially popped,
[1:55:55.360 --> 1:56:01.360]  years before it happens, and so this is pretty important info, to tell you that its supply
[1:56:01.360 --> 1:56:04.760]  worries make it $130 a total bull.
[1:56:04.760 --> 1:56:12.760]  The dollar is being devalued and oil is denominated for now in dollars, and so that's why you're
[1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:20.560]  paying $130, because your dollar has been devalued by 68% from 2000 levels opening with the euro,
[1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:27.440]  that would be 52% at parity with the euro in 2002, so you can cut it in either way you
[1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:33.400]  like, 60 plus or 50 plus percent reduction, that's why you've gone from $40 a barrel five
[1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:38.200]  years ago as they started devaluing the dollar, it follows when the dollar drops by a cent,
[1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:43.400]  all goes up a few dollars a barrel, and in an interview extrapolated out, it's an exact
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:48.480]  calculation for that, OPEC has actually kept production the same for several years, they
[1:56:48.480 --> 1:56:53.640]  increased it two years ago, so I'm not defending OPEC either, it's all part of the same mechanism,
[1:56:53.640 --> 1:56:57.280]  it's just that's not the part of the mechanism where you're being raped, but of course the
[1:56:57.280 --> 1:57:01.040]  establishment misdirects you, those raping you and devaluing the dollar with policies
[1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:06.480]  they had are the ones doing it, Kennedy being released from hospital, they see as terminal
[1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:11.960]  brain cancer, he's a very wicked man, but I still can't take glee in the fact that he'll
[1:57:11.960 --> 1:57:20.080]  be leaving us, and I'm sure he's got a one-way express ticket to hell, he has disarmed millions,
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:27.120]  he has caused the murder of millions, the rape and assault of millions, he has been
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:34.520]  a gun grabbing, anti-family, CPS loving pig, and he'll be going to hell soon probably,
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:40.520]  I'm not trying to judge, but I would guess he's going to hell, doesn't matter his life
[1:57:40.520 --> 1:57:47.480]  is hell, he's a sack of crap, excuse me folks, I just can't handle it, this is the attack
[1:57:47.480 --> 1:57:51.720]  on Iran tracks the constitution, we'll get to that later, we got some news on Bilderberg
[1:57:51.720 --> 1:57:55.600]  out of Jim Tucker yesterday, big breaking news, now putting an article format up on
[1:57:55.600 --> 1:58:00.360]  prisonplanet.com, we need your help on this, getting it out to people, so everybody knows
[1:58:00.360 --> 1:58:05.680]  it's confirmed, I am going to be there for the full 3 days, the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, starts
[1:58:05.680 --> 1:58:12.160]  on the 6th, 5th to the 8th, officially 6th to the 8th, and it's at the Westfields Marriott
[1:58:12.160 --> 1:58:17.600]  in Chantilly, so more on that later, we've got a state senator who's saying 9-11's an
[1:58:17.600 --> 1:58:21.840]  inside job, joined us for 20 minutes, 30 minutes, a few weeks ago, I got her for a full hour
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:27.200]  to take your calls, we'll be back in 70 seconds to talk about how to go after the criminals
[1:58:27.200 --> 1:58:33.320]  in government that are raping us at their leisure.
[1:58:33.320 --> 1:58:41.920]  Thank you for listening to GCN, be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:41.920 --> 1:58:46.200]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:50.800]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:58:50.800 --> 1:58:56.720]  It's known as the Bilderberg, but their objective being world domination.
[1:58:56.720 --> 1:58:59.880]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:58:59.880 --> 1:59:04.880]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[1:59:04.880 --> 1:59:10.240]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:10.240 --> 1:59:15.680]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:59:15.680 --> 1:59:19.560]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:59:19.560 --> 1:59:22.240]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[1:59:22.240 --> 1:59:25.360]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[1:59:25.360 --> 1:59:27.360]  they're after power, yes they're after music.
[1:59:27.360 --> 1:59:34.040]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now
[1:59:34.040 --> 1:59:44.240]  at prisonplanet.tv in-game, blueprint for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[1:59:44.240 --> 1:59:55.200]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:55.200 --> 2:00:09.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:54.120]  He also does presentations, I guess I'll let him describe what he thinks he is and the
[2:00:54.120 --> 2:01:01.120]  work he does, there's a lot of these kind of tinkers in law and the Constitution Bill
[2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:05.560]  of Rights and most of them are very unsuccessful, I've seen them send many people I know, acquaintances
[2:01:05.560 --> 2:01:15.600]  to prison, magical strawman theories, UCC theories, imaginary quackery.
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:19.960]  And so I don't traffic in that or people setting up trust and then they have you sign
[2:01:19.960 --> 2:01:22.440]  your property over to them and they take it.
[2:01:22.440 --> 2:01:25.680]  Some of the folks around 10 years ago used to do that and so would do with them and then
[2:01:25.680 --> 2:01:29.720]  they'd say I was a government agent because I wouldn't promote sending my listeners to
[2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:32.560]  somebody to get them sent to prison.
[2:01:32.560 --> 2:01:37.600]  Basic stuff like you saw with the poor freemen, passing all these fake notes around, I'm not
[2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:42.280]  even saying they're bad people, they just are given a line of bull and they run with
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:46.240]  it and that's why I have Larry Becraft on and other real lawyers and constitutional scholars
[2:01:46.240 --> 2:01:50.240]  because there are, George Gordon's another good one, he's one of the Supreme Court and
[2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:55.160]  other state courts and state supreme courts and federal appellate courts.
[2:01:55.160 --> 2:01:59.520]  So I only have on people who I know won't send you directly to jail.
[2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:01.960]  Still fighting the enemy will have them come after you in many cases.
[2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:06.880]  These are criminals who've had their way that almost always win who even think being criminal
[2:02:06.880 --> 2:02:08.680]  is good.
[2:02:08.680 --> 2:02:13.560]  And so Randy Kelton, we'll also be talking during the breaks if you're listening to infowars.com
[2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:19.640]  audio streams or watching on prisonplanet.tv, we're kind of overbooked today and so I want
[2:02:19.640 --> 2:02:21.600]  to give him most of the full hour.
[2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:24.400]  So we're just going to talk straight through during the three minute breaks.
[2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:29.160]  So folks, I'm sorry to the MNFM, this info is too important, but we appreciate you, folks
[2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:33.520]  will hear that after the break, but for internet listeners and for folks watching at prisonplanet.tv,
[2:02:33.520 --> 2:02:34.520]  this is so important.
[2:02:34.520 --> 2:02:38.800]  It's a public service announcement that we're going to go ahead and go blow through the
[2:02:38.800 --> 2:02:43.000]  breaks, but you'll have to go to infowars.com to hear those on those streams.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  Also even though you hear this, don't think you can just run out and do this immediately.
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:50.520]  You might see your own peril, this is a lawless criminal government.
[2:02:50.520 --> 2:02:55.200]  So there is no silver bullet here, but I want to thank Randy Kelton for coming in, Randy,
[2:02:55.200 --> 2:02:59.680]  take a minute or two to tell folks about yourself, veteran, how you woke up at the New World Order,
[2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:02.640]  some of the things you, I like how you talk about some of the wrong things you did, how
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:06.480]  you woke up to that because people can always turn back and become good people like you've
[2:03:06.480 --> 2:03:09.160]  done and then stand up for righteousness.
[2:03:09.160 --> 2:03:11.160]  Thanks for coming in.
[2:03:11.160 --> 2:03:12.400]  You're welcome.
[2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:18.840]  I started this 1981, I spent the night in jail for driving with a headlight out.
[2:03:18.840 --> 2:03:20.600]  That did not seem right.
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:25.040]  So when I got out of jail, I got out the penal code and code of criminal procedure and I
[2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:30.320]  read them and then I looked at what they were actually doing and I thought I must have stepped
[2:03:30.320 --> 2:03:37.080]  to the looking glass or there's some major maximum of law that I have missed.
[2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:38.080]  But let's go back.
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:41.280]  Let's talk about you, Randy Kelton, the person, you know, about your life, regular guy.
[2:03:41.280 --> 2:03:46.280]  Well, I was just a regular guy, I had my own business, I'm a combat veteran.
[2:03:46.280 --> 2:03:49.880]  Talk a little bit about your experience there.
[2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:57.040]  Well, my main experience I had there was Uncle Sam gave me the honor and privilege of holding
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:03.320]  my twin brother's hand in Chulai, South Vietnam while he died of gangrene.
[2:04:03.320 --> 2:04:08.560]  The last intelligible thing he said to me on this earth before the gangrene of pain
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:14.040]  and morphine took his mind away, he was looking across the hall at a VC they were taking care
[2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:17.640]  of and he said, you know, they're going to win this war.
[2:04:17.640 --> 2:04:19.640]  And I said, well, why would you say that?
[2:04:19.640 --> 2:04:20.880]  They're the good guys.
[2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:22.840]  We should never have been here.
[2:04:22.840 --> 2:04:30.240]  My brother died thinking he was the bad guy and in my later studies I found he was right.
[2:04:30.240 --> 2:04:32.440]  They were fighting for their independence.
[2:04:32.440 --> 2:04:33.440]  We were shooting at him.
[2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:34.440]  We shouldn't have been there.
[2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:35.720]  Tell you what, stay there folks.
[2:04:35.720 --> 2:04:36.720]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:41.120]  Anyway, let's continue this discussion during this break for all the Prison Planet dot TV
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:42.120]  viewers.
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:48.760]  Stay with us.
[2:04:48.760 --> 2:04:50.720]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:04:50.720 --> 2:04:55.240]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[2:04:55.240 --> 2:04:56.760]  hour there is hope.
[2:04:56.760 --> 2:04:59.600]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:04.040]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[2:05:04.040 --> 2:05:05.560]  World Order master plan.
[2:05:05.560 --> 2:05:09.800]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:05:09.800 --> 2:05:14.280]  In the Info War, Prison Planet dot TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our

[2:05:31.240 --> 2:05:36.120]  By weekly news, television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews and so much more.

[2:05:49.240 --> 2:05:52.680]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[2:05:52.680 --> 2:05:56.580]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[2:05:56.580 --> 2:05:58.160]  than when drinking the water?
[2:05:58.160 --> 2:06:02.240]  It's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into
[2:06:02.240 --> 2:06:03.240]  the skin.
[2:06:03.240 --> 2:06:07.840]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to

[2:06:19.560 --> 2:06:20.560]  comes first.
[2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:24.720]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:26.800]  iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[2:07:59.200 --> 2:08:01.400]  Well, so does he.
[2:08:01.400 --> 2:08:19.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:08:19.080 --> 2:08:25.960]  He's Randy Kelton, the rule of law, is what he talks about, and we'll give you one of
[2:08:25.960 --> 2:08:28.160]  his websites.
[2:08:28.160 --> 2:08:37.560]  It's jurismprudence.com, not jurisprudence, but jurismprudence.com, J-U-R-I-S-I-M, prudence.com.
[2:08:37.560 --> 2:08:41.680]  We'll tell you more about that as we have him with us in the hour.
[2:08:41.680 --> 2:08:46.040]  So it's the early 1980s, start back there, you get pulled over, then you get taken to
[2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:49.560]  jail for a headlight out, and you go back and look at the law and look at what they're
[2:08:49.560 --> 2:08:53.560]  supposed to do and look at the code, break that down, then we'll go through the sagas
[2:08:53.560 --> 2:08:57.160]  and the things you've witnessed and the people you've gotten fired, the people you've gotten
[2:08:57.160 --> 2:09:00.680]  in trouble because you have had some successes.
[2:09:00.680 --> 2:09:02.960]  And I've had some failures.
[2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:07.880]  The reason I brought that up is so many people go before the courts and they get screwed
[2:09:07.880 --> 2:09:11.800]  around and they think there must be some magic thing that I missed.
[2:09:11.800 --> 2:09:14.920]  There's something important I don't know.
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:17.160]  Well, there's not.
[2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:19.360]  These guys are just criminals.
[2:09:19.360 --> 2:09:23.920]  They're just doing whatever they want to do because they believe they can.
[2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:30.560]  I kicked this dog for some 25 years, three dislocated ribs, two broken collar bones and
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:32.560]  broken elbow.
[2:09:32.560 --> 2:09:36.760]  I never brought this to anyone else because I hadn't found a way to do it safely.
[2:09:36.760 --> 2:09:38.440]  Well, let's go through all the things that happened.
[2:09:38.440 --> 2:09:41.280]  I mean, let's go back to the cop arrest you for no headlight.
[2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:42.280]  How did that happen?
[2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:44.120]  And then go through all the things you've been through.
[2:09:44.120 --> 2:09:49.680]  He was in a bad mood and he asked me for my proof of insurance and I said, well, if I show
[2:09:49.680 --> 2:09:54.000]  you my proof of insurance and you look at it and see that it expired yesterday, what
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  will you do?
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  He said, I'll arrest you.
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:57.880]  In that case, I'm not going to show it to you.
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:10:02.680]  Well, he arrested me anyway, but that was really a minor thing.
[2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:04.840]  It just opened the door.
[2:10:04.840 --> 2:10:08.760]  After that, I had a sheriff's deputy try to kill me once in front of my house.
[2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:10.640]  What happened with that?
[2:10:10.640 --> 2:10:11.640]  We went to court.
[2:10:11.640 --> 2:10:13.280]  I beat him in court.
[2:10:13.280 --> 2:10:18.440]  But the deputies made up a story that never happened and there was a street full of witnesses.
[2:10:18.440 --> 2:10:20.040]  And that shocks you when they lie.
[2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:22.840]  I've had them do it to me and it's like, you're a criminal.
[2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:24.720]  And they just smile and go, yeah, I am.
[2:10:24.720 --> 2:10:26.360]  We had a whole street full of witnesses.
[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:30.200]  I'm thinking, how can they imagine they can get this past the courts?
[2:10:30.200 --> 2:10:31.200]  They could.
[2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:35.120]  The courts was not interested in anything anyone had to say.
[2:10:35.120 --> 2:10:42.640]  They were intent on prosecuting me no matter what, but the jury was not quite so intent.
[2:10:42.640 --> 2:10:50.800]  My daughter worked for a woman whose husband was on the jury and she said they were irate
[2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:54.080]  when they found out what was actually going on.
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:59.920]  So I beat them there, but I was in the process of trying to fix the system.
[2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:07.560]  I felt like I owed this to my brother, that I should lay down and roll over for the scum
[2:11:07.560 --> 2:11:09.760]  after what he paid for.
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:11.720]  So the fight was on.
[2:11:11.720 --> 2:11:16.320]  And I didn't, I just appeared recently on the scene because I wouldn't ask someone to
[2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:17.320]  take the kind of risks.
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:21.360]  So you've been doing this for two decades, plush, and you've now developed some things
[2:11:21.360 --> 2:11:22.360]  you think work.
[2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:23.360]  Yes.
[2:11:23.360 --> 2:11:28.220]  When I came across actually filing criminal charges against them and going after grand
[2:11:28.220 --> 2:11:31.080]  juries, everything changed.
[2:11:31.080 --> 2:11:33.680]  Folks, there is an answer out there.
[2:11:33.680 --> 2:11:37.560]  Well, we're going to talk about it, but let's go back to how you got bones broken.
[2:11:37.560 --> 2:11:40.880]  Well, I had a sheriff deputy grab me.
[2:11:40.880 --> 2:11:44.520]  And he was just one of these policemen who shouldn't have been a policeman.
[2:11:44.520 --> 2:11:45.520]  That's a power trip.
[2:11:45.520 --> 2:11:46.520]  Yeah.
[2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:50.640]  He had stopped my son in front of my house a day after I filed suit against the sheriff
[2:11:50.640 --> 2:11:53.000]  over an open records issue.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:55.440]  It's just a technical suit.
[2:11:55.440 --> 2:11:59.560]  And the next day I looked out my front door and I saw this policeman out there throw something
[2:11:59.560 --> 2:12:02.120]  down, kick it up in the air.
[2:12:02.120 --> 2:12:03.440]  And I thought that looked odd.
[2:12:03.440 --> 2:12:04.440]  I stepped outside.
[2:12:04.440 --> 2:12:08.080]  He had my son pulled over in front of my house and when I went to find out what was
[2:12:08.080 --> 2:12:14.760]  going on, he tried to kill me and people claimed that the sheriff sent him to do it, but I
[2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:15.760]  don't think so.
[2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:16.760]  The guy was just crazy.
[2:12:16.760 --> 2:12:20.840]  Well, I've seen cases where the guy's got a sign saying our judicial system's a joke
[2:12:20.840 --> 2:12:24.880]  outside the judge's jurisdiction and he has cops go arrest him for saying that.
[2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:27.640]  I mean, they're just, they're crazy.
[2:12:27.640 --> 2:12:31.000]  What I do will help put an end to that.
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:33.080]  It really does work.
[2:12:33.080 --> 2:12:37.600]  When you start thinking and acting like a sovereign, I don't even mess with policemen
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:38.600]  anymore.
[2:12:38.600 --> 2:12:41.040]  Well, I want to talk about all that and we're going to, we'll have you back again, Randy,
[2:12:41.040 --> 2:12:46.320]  but right now I want people to get the backside of this, kind of the war stories and abbreviated
[2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:47.640]  the saga.
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:50.640]  Some of the things you've seen, like a few months ago in Williamson County, you went
[2:12:50.640 --> 2:12:51.640]  to file a complaint.
[2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:52.640]  What happened there?
[2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:55.480]  I mean, I don't think citizens until it happens to them, then they're isolated.
[2:12:55.480 --> 2:12:56.480]  Nobody cares.
[2:12:56.480 --> 2:12:59.960]  Realize what it's like till they're there framing you.
[2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:00.960]  Yes.
[2:13:00.960 --> 2:13:07.160]  For me, it was difficult and I absolutely knew that I'm going to kick you guys behinds
[2:13:07.160 --> 2:13:09.240]  ever away from Sunday.
[2:13:09.240 --> 2:13:14.560]  But it was still difficult standing on that cold concrete floor for 29 hours.
[2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:17.200]  But this happens to everybody.
[2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:18.360]  I've had a number of things.
[2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:19.360]  My elbow got broke.
[2:13:19.360 --> 2:13:24.880]  It was kind of my fault because I told a bailiff when I was trying to file criminal charges
[2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:30.640]  with the grand jury against the district attorney and he demanded to know what my purpose was
[2:13:30.640 --> 2:13:31.840]  in the building today.
[2:13:31.840 --> 2:13:35.000]  And I had already asked him for the grand jury.
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:36.760]  So he knew.
[2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:41.400]  So I told him, well, I have business here today and it's none of yours.
[2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:45.240]  He said, well, I'm the court security officer and the bailiff and court bailiff and I want
[2:13:45.240 --> 2:13:46.720]  to know what your business is.
[2:13:46.720 --> 2:13:49.560]  I said, well, if you're the court bailiff, then right there's the courtroom.
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:51.760]  Just scoot on in there and be a good little bailiff.
[2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:53.000]  You're dismissed.
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:55.280]  Well, he didn't take that well.
[2:13:55.280 --> 2:13:56.720]  You don't talk to a God like that.
[2:13:56.720 --> 2:14:00.160]  They talk to us, the slaves like that, not the other way around.
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:03.560]  They drugged me down the stairs and pushed me out the door.
[2:14:03.560 --> 2:14:06.000]  But to his credit, he didn't intend to break my elbow.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:07.520]  Oh, how nice of him.
[2:14:07.520 --> 2:14:08.520]  Okay.
[2:14:08.520 --> 2:14:14.400]  As I stepped out the door, my foot stepped down on a throw rug, a carpet there.
[2:14:14.400 --> 2:14:18.240]  And he was pushing me so it gave me a little forward movement and scooted that carpet out
[2:14:18.240 --> 2:14:21.940]  from under me and I fell and broke my elbow.
[2:14:21.940 --> 2:14:25.320]  But I didn't charge him with that.
[2:14:25.320 --> 2:14:28.480]  I've been real careful in what I do.
[2:14:28.480 --> 2:14:33.400]  If they can get you into a fight with them, they will win every time.
[2:14:33.400 --> 2:14:36.560]  Well, that's why they'll come up and yell and scream at you while you're calm and say,
[2:14:36.560 --> 2:14:37.720]  why are you so upset?
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:38.720]  Yeah.
[2:14:38.720 --> 2:14:44.520]  And if they get too excited with me, I like to take out my cell phone dial 911.
[2:14:44.520 --> 2:14:45.800]  I got this policeman here.
[2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:47.360]  I think he's going crazy.
[2:14:47.360 --> 2:14:49.200]  He's got slobber dripping out of his mouth.
[2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:50.200]  His eyes are bugging out.
[2:14:50.200 --> 2:14:51.960]  I think he's going to have a heart attack.
[2:14:51.960 --> 2:14:55.480]  You need to get somebody out here before he shoots me.
[2:14:55.480 --> 2:14:59.880]  This always slows them down because they wind up with another policeman out there.
[2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:01.280]  And you call that the chicken dance?
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:06.120]  Yeah, they start doing this little chicken dance where the one I call and I'm asking
[2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:12.920]  him to arrest his buddy and he's got my call on 911 and that's not going to go away.
[2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:19.920]  He don't want to arrest his buddy and I keep insisting and with him I get real obnoxious.
[2:15:19.920 --> 2:15:24.320]  And he starts scooting back and forth on one from one foot to another and I call that
[2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:26.680]  their little chicken dance.
[2:15:26.680 --> 2:15:33.120]  When you become the sovereign and invoke the same law that they use against you, it changes
[2:15:33.120 --> 2:15:35.840]  everything.
[2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:39.720]  So I've been doing this quite a while and it took some time.
[2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:43.640]  It took some learning of things you can do and things you can't do.
[2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:45.280]  Stay away from the sheriff.
[2:15:45.280 --> 2:15:47.360]  Stay away from the police department.
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:50.040]  All that'll do is get you beat up.
[2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:55.120]  Well I was thrown out of the sheriff's department one day by the chief deputy when I was there
[2:15:55.120 --> 2:16:00.040]  to file criminal complaints and I stood in front of the place and looked around and thought,
[2:16:00.040 --> 2:16:05.120]  I bet if I try to leave this county, somebody's going to be waiting for me.
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:08.200]  So I went to the county judge and asked him to call the sheriff's department and see if
[2:16:08.200 --> 2:16:10.000]  they had a warrant for me.
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:12.720]  Asked him to call the chief deputy.
[2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:16.720]  And the county judge won't know why I won't even do that.
[2:16:16.720 --> 2:16:20.760]  I said, well, I got a bad feeling he's going to be sitting out there on the highway waiting
[2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:21.760]  for me.
[2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:23.680]  Oh, he wouldn't do a thing like that.
[2:16:23.680 --> 2:16:26.000]  I don't know, but if he did, it'd be bad news.
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:29.560]  He called the sheriff's department and asked for Doug.
[2:16:29.560 --> 2:16:30.560]  Well Doug's not here.
[2:16:30.560 --> 2:16:33.120]  He's out in his cruiser.
[2:16:33.120 --> 2:16:38.960]  The judge looked at me and kind of give me a halfway smile and said, well, have Doug
[2:16:38.960 --> 2:16:41.280]  call me.
[2:16:41.280 --> 2:16:46.480]  Doug called him and he said, I have Randy Keltner in my office and he's concerned that
[2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:50.720]  someone may be out waiting on the highway for him to go home.
[2:16:50.720 --> 2:16:52.640]  Where are you, Mr. Whitehead?
[2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:57.200]  Oh, well, I'm just making some rounds in my cruiser since when does the chief deputy make
[2:16:57.200 --> 2:16:58.200]  rounds?
[2:16:58.200 --> 2:16:59.920]  Well, I had business to take care of.
[2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:03.480]  Well, Mr. Whitehead, I hope your business is back at the sheriff's department.
[2:17:03.480 --> 2:17:05.120]  No, no, that's not even paranoia.
[2:17:05.120 --> 2:17:07.680]  Tell us what just happened here in Williamson County.
[2:17:07.680 --> 2:17:08.680]  Why you were there?
[2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:09.680]  What happened?
[2:17:09.680 --> 2:17:15.120]  Well, I went to Williamson County because everyone told me that Williamson County is
[2:17:15.120 --> 2:17:18.320]  the most corrupt in the nation or in the state.
[2:17:18.320 --> 2:17:22.600]  I do seminars all over the country and everybody says, my county is the most corrupt in the
[2:17:22.600 --> 2:17:25.200]  state except here.
[2:17:25.200 --> 2:17:30.960]  Here everybody says Williamson County is the most corrupt and something I know about the
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:35.520]  more corrupt they are, the more vulnerable they are.
[2:17:35.520 --> 2:17:40.360]  Most policemen don't get into the police work to be jackbooted thugs, but they get stuck
[2:17:40.360 --> 2:17:42.200]  in this corrupt system.
[2:17:42.200 --> 2:17:43.500]  They know it's corrupt.
[2:17:43.500 --> 2:17:46.320]  They don't like it, but if they're going to keep their job, they're going to follow
[2:17:46.320 --> 2:17:51.000]  along and then somebody comes along and points their finger right at it.
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:53.360]  Well, they knew they were corrupt all the time.
[2:17:53.360 --> 2:17:56.600]  The more corrupt they are, the more concerned they are.
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:00.680]  And the first thing they're going to do is creak open their little closet door and look
[2:18:00.680 --> 2:18:04.400]  at their darkest skeleton and figure I'm going to find it.
[2:18:04.400 --> 2:18:06.440]  So that's why I went to Williamson County.
[2:18:06.440 --> 2:18:11.840]  I filed a criminal charge with the district attorney against the sheriff's deputy.
[2:18:11.840 --> 2:18:15.120]  And that was with what had happened?
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:22.200]  A deputy had arrested a woman in Travis County, sitting in a parking lot with her lights on.
[2:18:22.200 --> 2:18:24.500]  He saw a headlight out.
[2:18:24.500 --> 2:18:27.800]  He pulled into Travis County.
[2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:29.000]  He was in front of a beer joint.
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:35.240]  He did a sobriety test owner, ran her license and found that 10 years earlier, she'd had
[2:18:35.240 --> 2:18:38.640]  three DUIs and had been 10 years.
[2:18:38.640 --> 2:18:43.480]  When she was in her late teens and pretty wild, she got over that.
[2:18:43.480 --> 2:18:46.360]  So he arrested her, took her back to Williamson County.
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:51.520]  It had been almost a year, her trying to get it to trial.
[2:18:51.520 --> 2:18:53.960]  So they told me about it.
[2:18:53.960 --> 2:18:59.720]  And the first thing I did is filed criminal charges against the officer for false arrest.
[2:18:59.720 --> 2:19:03.360]  You're not supposed to be out of your jurisdiction.
[2:19:03.360 --> 2:19:08.320]  Technically he can go 400 yards out of his jurisdiction, but not for a misdemeanor, only
[2:19:08.320 --> 2:19:09.320]  for a felony.
[2:19:09.320 --> 2:19:15.060]  And he claimed that he followed her from Williamson County into Travis County.
[2:19:15.060 --> 2:19:17.080]  So he lied.
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:18.520]  We had conflicting opinions.
[2:19:18.520 --> 2:19:20.440]  I wanted a grand jury to sort it out.
[2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:25.240]  Actually I wanted the district attorney to refuse to take the complaint so I could try
[2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:27.560]  to get him arrested.
[2:19:27.560 --> 2:19:30.040]  I always want to go for the highest guy in the district.
[2:19:30.040 --> 2:19:33.480]  Don't want to mess with the policeman.
[2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:35.320]  Article 2.03 Texas Code of Justice.
[2:19:35.320 --> 2:19:36.320]  Stay there.
[2:19:36.320 --> 2:19:37.960]  We're going to get into how to do this when we get back.
[2:19:37.960 --> 2:19:41.480]  And we'll talk about some other issues behind the scenes at infowars.com.
[2:19:41.480 --> 2:19:42.480]  We're listening there.
[2:19:42.480 --> 2:19:43.480]  I'm Alex Jones.

[2:22:47.760 --> 2:22:50.320]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[2:22:50.320 --> 2:22:53.720]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what
[2:22:53.720 --> 2:22:57.760]  is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[2:22:57.760 --> 2:23:01.600]  For the last three years, the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce,
[2:23:01.600 --> 2:23:03.360]  and it has now finally caught up with us.
[2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:07.000]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:10.320]  rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[2:23:10.320 --> 2:23:13.560]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary
[2:23:13.560 --> 2:23:17.920]  to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:19.600]  Remember our trade deficit?
[2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:22.920]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our
[2:23:22.920 --> 2:23:25.160]  food production at any price.
[2:23:25.160 --> 2:23:29.240]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food
[2:23:29.240 --> 2:23:31.640]  and food exports under martial law.

[2:23:54.520 --> 2:23:58.120]  I was talking to Randy Kelton behind the scenes of Prison Planet.tv viewers, he was
[2:23:58.120 --> 2:24:03.840]  just telling me about one case in Texas where they pull a young guy over, claim he's drinking,
[2:24:03.840 --> 2:24:08.520]  and he was in jail five months without a charge, without a name, without a hearing, and I hear
[2:24:08.520 --> 2:24:12.680]  about this all the time, see it in the news now, where they just grab you and throw you
[2:24:12.680 --> 2:24:17.840]  in jail, and you had to go file criminal charges, habeas, corpus, documents, all of this.
[2:24:17.840 --> 2:24:20.440]  This isn't just Abu Ghraib, people getting flown to Camp X-Ray.
[2:24:20.440 --> 2:24:24.520]  I mean, U.S. citizens now, I just get, it's not even a contempt charge.
[2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:27.160]  They just say, we just put you in jail now.
[2:24:27.160 --> 2:24:31.200]  I mean, that is the opposite of what our country's based on.
[2:24:31.200 --> 2:24:32.200]  Exactly.
[2:24:32.200 --> 2:24:41.240]  The document I filed, the writ of habeas corpus, it stipulates how every step from arrest to
[2:24:41.240 --> 2:24:48.960]  trial as presently practiced in Texas is not only wrong, it is very specifically against
[2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:49.960]  particular law.
[2:24:49.960 --> 2:24:53.440]  And to be clear though, you've been practicing and exposing things in Texas, but you've looked
[2:24:53.440 --> 2:24:55.480]  at it all over the country, it's the same.
[2:24:55.480 --> 2:25:00.880]  Everywhere I go, this writ of habeas corpus is written on Texas law, but it's based on
[2:25:00.880 --> 2:25:01.880]  federal law.
[2:25:01.880 --> 2:25:03.640]  It's essentially the same everywhere.
[2:25:03.640 --> 2:25:08.240]  Everywhere I go, people read it, they say the same things going on here.
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:12.480]  And everywhere I go, everybody says, my county is the most corrupt.
[2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:13.480]  Well, here's an example.
[2:25:13.480 --> 2:25:17.920]  I got arrested protesting, and then they come to the door, and then they just took me away,
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:22.520]  because you don't have free speech in Austin, and they pay $100,000 and $500,000 lawsuits
[2:25:22.520 --> 2:25:25.520]  every few weeks for arresting people at demonstrations.
[2:25:25.520 --> 2:25:27.400]  They just take our tax money and pay it.
[2:25:27.400 --> 2:25:28.400]  They don't care.
[2:25:28.400 --> 2:25:31.760]  They're still going to keep, they got to stop that freedom, got to stop that free speech,
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:34.760]  or the public might wake up and take them all to prison.
[2:25:34.760 --> 2:25:37.960]  But they came to my jail cell and they said, we want you to sign this, and had all this
[2:25:37.960 --> 2:25:42.800]  big list of crimes I'd committed to get out, and I said, well, this is a plea of guilt.
[2:25:42.800 --> 2:25:45.880]  And then years later, Mike Hansen got arrested, and he told me this, and I went and got the
[2:25:45.880 --> 2:25:46.880]  copy.
[2:25:46.880 --> 2:25:47.880]  They even gave it to me.
[2:25:47.880 --> 2:25:51.200]  They don't even, I mean, the Soviets would torture you underground and show you a document
[2:25:51.200 --> 2:25:52.200]  and say sign it.
[2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:55.440]  Here in America, they just say, the average idiot doesn't know, they go, here sign your
[2:25:55.440 --> 2:26:00.320]  personal recognizance bond, and you're agreeing that you've committed drug dealing, drunken
[2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:04.080]  driving, you're agreeing to all these classes that you've committed a crime.
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:06.560]  Yeah, that's common practice.
[2:26:06.560 --> 2:26:11.200]  I mean, the government's just totally lawless, and do the cops know, and do the jailers know
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:12.200]  their criminals?
[2:26:12.200 --> 2:26:13.200]  Yes.
[2:26:13.200 --> 2:26:14.200]  Oh, they do.
[2:26:14.200 --> 2:26:16.000]  And for the most part, they don't like it.
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  It's not as bad as we think.
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.400]  There is a remedy out there.
[2:26:20.400 --> 2:26:26.400]  And while I don't blame the policeman, the remedy involves kicking him right square in
[2:26:26.400 --> 2:26:29.240]  his behind as hard as you can.
[2:26:29.240 --> 2:26:33.800]  So he has plausible deniability to go to his boss and say, if you want to arrest this guy
[2:26:33.800 --> 2:26:36.680]  and take him to jail, you do it.
[2:26:36.680 --> 2:26:39.840]  I'm not having him take my bass boat.
[2:26:39.840 --> 2:26:42.360]  You accuse the individual of a crime.
[2:26:42.360 --> 2:26:43.960]  Forget the guys at the top.
[2:26:43.960 --> 2:26:48.200]  Take that personal individual, accuse him of committing a criminal act.
[2:26:48.200 --> 2:26:51.240]  When he commits a criminal act, he loses his immunity.
[2:26:51.240 --> 2:26:52.440]  You can sue him personally.
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:53.640]  I know, yeah.
[2:26:53.640 --> 2:26:55.760]  Now you put him under threat.
[2:26:55.760 --> 2:27:00.720]  When I file against every jailer in the jail in Williamson County for following policy,
[2:27:00.720 --> 2:27:02.440]  they're going to say, what?
[2:27:02.440 --> 2:27:03.440]  What do I do?
[2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:06.800]  And I'm going to say, you touched the tar baby, Bubba.
[2:27:06.800 --> 2:27:10.880]  Now, I want to get into first off, you've had quite a few victories now, and then in
[2:27:10.880 --> 2:27:13.120]  the 30 minutes we've got left, let's get into what you do.
[2:27:13.120 --> 2:27:14.480]  I'd like to have you back, Randy.
[2:27:14.480 --> 2:27:15.480]  You're really a great guy.
[2:27:15.480 --> 2:27:18.040]  We appreciate you coming in.
[2:27:18.040 --> 2:27:19.040]  We've had some victories.
[2:27:19.040 --> 2:27:21.000]  Yes, I have.
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:26.080]  The writ we spoke of earlier, the one I filed in Danny Schul's behalf, I filed it with a
[2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:27.280]  local district judge.
[2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:30.080]  They stopped a murder trial to hear it.
[2:27:30.080 --> 2:27:33.840]  And the judge threw me out of the courtroom because I wasn't an attorney.
[2:27:33.840 --> 2:27:39.480]  So I prepared criminal charges against the judge and then filed the writ with the Texas
[2:27:39.480 --> 2:27:43.200]  Court of Criminal Appeals, highest court in Texas.
[2:27:43.200 --> 2:27:48.040]  They insisted that I file a motion for leave to file.
[2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:50.640]  Then they denied me leave to file.
[2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:56.640]  Well, writ of Habies Corpus is the only court filing mentioned in Constitution.
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:27:59.080]  Say writ of right.
[2:27:59.080 --> 2:28:02.040]  So the great writ, the great writ.
[2:28:02.040 --> 2:28:06.360]  They denied me permission to exercise a constitutional right.
[2:28:06.360 --> 2:28:10.560]  I see that as official oppression, a class A misdemeanor in Texas.
[2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:15.000]  I went down to the bailiff above the grand jury and I told the bailiff instruct the
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:18.080]  foreman I have business with the grand jury.
[2:28:18.080 --> 2:28:22.320]  Instead of instructing the foreman, she called the district attorney who came down and insisted
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:25.760]  that this was the grand jury's last day and their calendar is full.
[2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:28.580]  They just will not have time to hear your complaint.
[2:28:28.580 --> 2:28:31.360]  But if you're giving me, I'll give them the next grand jury.
[2:28:31.360 --> 2:28:37.400]  And I told her, make sure you do because if you don't, you'll start a fight with me and
[2:28:37.400 --> 2:28:39.640]  you that I don't want to have.
[2:28:39.640 --> 2:28:41.960]  He did not give it to the grand jury.
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:47.520]  So I came back to the grand jury with and told the bailiff instruct the foreman I have
[2:28:47.520 --> 2:28:49.960]  business with the grand jury.
[2:28:49.960 --> 2:28:54.320]  Instead she called the district attorney and handed me the phone said, this is the district
[2:28:54.320 --> 2:28:55.320]  attorney.
[2:28:55.320 --> 2:28:56.320]  She wants to talk to you.
[2:28:56.320 --> 2:28:59.160]  I said, if you'll look at those complaints, you'll find their complaints against the district
[2:28:59.160 --> 2:29:00.320]  attorney.
[2:29:00.320 --> 2:29:01.320]  She's a criminal.
[2:29:01.320 --> 2:29:02.760]  I don't talk to criminals.
[2:29:02.760 --> 2:29:08.720]  And the bailiff took the phone back and we've got this on video.
[2:29:08.720 --> 2:29:14.080]  He said he can't talk to you because you're the criminal and he don't talk to criminals.
[2:29:14.080 --> 2:29:19.200]  She came out anyway and stopped me from filing criminal complaints against herself with the
[2:29:19.200 --> 2:29:20.200]  grand jury.
[2:29:20.200 --> 2:29:24.720]  And now that is a conflict of interest obstruction of justice and a bunch of other things that
[2:29:24.720 --> 2:29:25.720]  is so horrendous.
[2:29:25.720 --> 2:29:27.080]  What else is it?
[2:29:27.080 --> 2:29:28.960]  It's official oppression.
[2:29:28.960 --> 2:29:31.480]  It's shielding from prosecution.
[2:29:31.480 --> 2:29:35.040]  And she brought someone with a pistol aggravated assault.
[2:29:35.040 --> 2:29:36.040]  Oh my God.
[2:29:36.040 --> 2:29:39.440]  People are absolutely out of their minds, we'll be right back.
[2:29:39.440 --> 2:29:40.720]  We're on the march.
[2:29:40.720 --> 2:29:43.120]  The empire's on the run.
[2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:48.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:48.760 --> 2:29:52.960]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity
[2:29:52.960 --> 2:29:54.120]  theft each year.
[2:29:54.120 --> 2:29:58.800]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds costing the victims an average of
[2:29:58.800 --> 2:29:59.800]  $8,000.
[2:29:59.800 --> 2:30:04.640]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication and often the only protection
[2:30:04.640 --> 2:30:07.680]  between a hacker and your personal information.
[2:30:07.680 --> 2:30:11.560]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file or any other file that
[2:30:11.560 --> 2:30:16.320]  is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[2:30:49.200 --> 2:30:53.440]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:30:53.440 --> 2:30:58.240]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:30:58.240 --> 2:31:04.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg, both their objective being world domination.
[2:31:04.000 --> 2:31:07.160]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:31:07.160 --> 2:31:13.080]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[2:31:13.080 --> 2:31:17.520]  of humanity is at hand.
[2:31:17.520 --> 2:31:22.520]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:31:22.520 --> 2:31:26.840]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:31:26.840 --> 2:31:29.520]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[2:31:29.520 --> 2:31:30.520]  Most people have no idea.
[2:31:30.520 --> 2:31:31.520]  They're not after money.
[2:31:31.520 --> 2:31:32.520]  They have all the money they need.
[2:31:32.520 --> 2:31:33.520]  They're after power.
[2:31:33.520 --> 2:31:34.520]  That's their affidavit.

[2:31:42.720 --> 2:31:43.720]  You have been warned.
[2:31:43.720 --> 2:31:44.720]  Why should we fire Congress?
[2:31:44.720 --> 2:31:45.720]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[2:31:45.720 --> 2:31:55.560]  They swear an oath to follow it and then they reject it.
[2:31:55.560 --> 2:31:58.200]  That was their employment document.
[2:31:58.200 --> 2:31:59.200]  They haven't followed it.
[2:31:59.200 --> 2:32:01.120]  Congressman, Senators, you're fired.
[2:32:01.120 --> 2:32:02.920]  Washington, you're fired.
[2:32:02.920 --> 2:32:05.040]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[2:32:05.040 --> 2:32:08.800]  Washington, you're fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current political
[2:32:08.800 --> 2:32:11.960]  system and it gives a voice to Americans across the country.
[2:32:11.960 --> 2:32:16.440]  Washington, you're fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster,
[2:32:16.440 --> 2:32:21.120]  the president's illegal spy program, NSA data mining, FISA secret court, the illegal
[2:32:21.120 --> 2:32:25.560]  wiretapping of millions of Americans and the last seven years of terror-related spy bills,
[2:32:25.560 --> 2:32:28.360]  how they affect you and what you can do about it.
[2:32:28.360 --> 2:32:32.400]  Washington, you're fired, captures the spirit and zest of an old-fashioned Boston Tea Party.
[2:32:32.400 --> 2:32:36.280]  Ken Williams describes the film as a rabble-rousing call to arms.
[2:32:36.280 --> 2:32:38.240]  We invite you to make the change with us.
[2:32:38.240 --> 2:32:39.720]  Help take back our government now.

[2:32:44.000 --> 2:32:45.800]  We have a plan to take back our government.

[2:33:02.680 --> 2:33:04.240]  Randy Kelton is our guest.
[2:33:04.240 --> 2:33:05.920]  He's had a lot of effect in the courts.
[2:33:05.920 --> 2:33:10.320]  I've seen him have some victories, get some people out of things they hadn't done.
[2:33:10.320 --> 2:33:14.280]  When lawyers wanted $20,000, he was able with basic procedures to have them just drop the
[2:33:14.280 --> 2:33:16.520]  cases.
[2:33:16.520 --> 2:33:19.040]  It's one big giant corrupt system.
[2:33:19.040 --> 2:33:23.400]  Randy, we were talking during the last break there for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:27.080]  We were just now getting into the procedures.
[2:33:27.080 --> 2:33:33.000]  The police officer in the old days took you before a judge first, and it was always over-wrestling
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:37.800]  or horse-thieving or rape or something serious, but they still had to bring you before a judge
[2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:41.360]  before the jail or they could hold you for maybe for a day before you went before a judge
[2:33:41.360 --> 2:33:42.360]  when the judge came in.
[2:33:42.360 --> 2:33:44.240]  It was on the weekend at night.
[2:33:44.240 --> 2:33:47.680]  Now they'll just take it for weeks, months in jail without even charges.
[2:33:47.680 --> 2:33:48.680]  That is kidnapping.
[2:33:48.680 --> 2:33:49.680]  That is official oppression.
[2:33:49.680 --> 2:33:53.280]  That is grade A tyranny, but all of this has just been standardized.
[2:33:53.280 --> 2:33:57.080]  But here's another example.
[2:33:57.080 --> 2:33:58.240]  Somebody steals your car.
[2:33:58.240 --> 2:33:59.480]  They won't come out and look into it.
[2:33:59.480 --> 2:34:02.040]  If you want to go file a report, they won't even let you.
[2:34:02.040 --> 2:34:07.000]  If you want to file charges on somebody who's knocked your teeth out, they'll just act like,
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:10.480]  well, come back later or I can't do that or go here.
[2:34:10.480 --> 2:34:14.440]  They don't let you know that they have to file that, and then if you turn out to be
[2:34:14.440 --> 2:34:18.920]  a liar, you get arrested for filing false charges.
[2:34:18.920 --> 2:34:20.720]  And so it's the same thing with grand juries.
[2:34:20.720 --> 2:34:22.600]  Grand juries used to be creatures of the people.
[2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:23.600]  They were open.
[2:34:23.600 --> 2:34:24.600]  They were discussed.
[2:34:24.600 --> 2:34:26.440]  Now they've become creatures of the prosecutors.
[2:34:26.440 --> 2:34:28.720]  Everything has been domesticated.
[2:34:28.720 --> 2:34:30.920]  So let's talk about that.
[2:34:30.920 --> 2:34:37.680]  When I've gone down many years ago, 10, 12 years ago when I had stalkers and people breaking
[2:34:37.680 --> 2:34:41.720]  my car and doing stuff, being in my backyard, and I'd go to them and they'd say, look,
[2:34:41.720 --> 2:34:42.920]  you don't like us cops.
[2:34:42.920 --> 2:34:45.880]  I'm not going to file a thing on him for you.
[2:34:45.880 --> 2:34:47.440]  Just get out of my office.
[2:34:47.440 --> 2:34:51.040]  And I was just like, whoa, and that was down here in Austin, and that's when I really started
[2:34:51.040 --> 2:34:52.040]  waking up.
[2:34:52.040 --> 2:34:55.360]  I mean, I'd grown up in Dallas where our sheriff went to jail for being a drug dealer and I'd
[2:34:55.360 --> 2:34:58.040]  seen all kinds of crazy stuff and knew it was all a joke.
[2:34:58.040 --> 2:35:01.200]  But I mean, this really is, these are hardcore crooks.
[2:35:01.200 --> 2:35:05.000]  I mean, you're saying your normal officer isn't like that on the ground.
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:09.040]  I know they're just out writing tickets and raising revenue and helping people occasionally.
[2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:13.440]  But higher up, I mean, it does seem to get more rotten as you get higher up the fish.
[2:35:13.440 --> 2:35:16.840]  You know, it rots from the head down, but I mean, Randy, that's a lot I've said, but
[2:35:16.840 --> 2:35:17.840]  comments on that.
[2:35:17.840 --> 2:35:20.720]  It goes to the law of crudulence.
[2:35:20.720 --> 2:35:23.080]  Crud sinks to the top.
[2:35:23.080 --> 2:35:26.320]  You have to be a scoundrel to ever get there.
[2:35:26.320 --> 2:35:31.080]  And I'm not saying all police are really white angels.
[2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:35.120]  There are a number of police out there who got into police work for reasons that should
[2:35:35.120 --> 2:35:37.540]  have kept them out of police work.
[2:35:37.540 --> 2:35:41.360]  But for the most part, they got into police work wanting to be a good guy.
[2:35:41.360 --> 2:35:47.920]  They found themselves trapped in this situation, this system that they didn't create.
[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:49.680]  They don't know how to fix it.
[2:35:49.680 --> 2:35:53.600]  I've had four different officers come to me and ask if I could do something to get rid
[2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:59.840]  of an officer they had because he was causing them so much embarrassment because he didn't
[2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:01.680]  belong there.
[2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:03.440]  But then he gets promoted.
[2:36:03.440 --> 2:36:04.440]  He's the one that gets promoted.
[2:36:04.440 --> 2:36:05.440]  The bad guy.
[2:36:05.440 --> 2:36:09.240]  I mean, I've literally seen them pull people who were quadripleased out and beat them up
[2:36:09.240 --> 2:36:11.640]  because they couldn't get out of the car fast enough.
[2:36:11.640 --> 2:36:13.480]  And then that guy gets promoted.
[2:36:13.480 --> 2:36:14.480]  Exactly.
[2:36:14.480 --> 2:36:16.280]  There is a technique.
[2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:20.320]  And mostly it's getting away from the guy at the bottom.
[2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:22.640]  A guy at the bottom gives me a problem.
[2:36:22.640 --> 2:36:26.240]  Or if I have a complaint to file, I never file it with the police.
[2:36:26.240 --> 2:36:28.440]  I go file it with a judge.
[2:36:28.440 --> 2:36:32.520]  And if the judge refuses to take it, wonderful.
[2:36:32.520 --> 2:36:38.360]  Now I get to go to the district attorney and file criminal charges against the judge.
[2:36:38.360 --> 2:36:41.360]  And the district attorney is not even going to take that.
[2:36:41.360 --> 2:36:45.320]  Now I get to file criminal charges directly with the grand jury.
[2:36:45.320 --> 2:36:48.440]  And there's a number of innovative ways to get that.
[2:36:48.440 --> 2:36:53.400]  The grand jury is still as powerful as it always has been.
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:57.920]  It's just that the officials have gotten better at hiding them from us.
[2:36:57.920 --> 2:36:58.920]  They hate grand juries.
[2:36:58.920 --> 2:37:01.680]  Oh, no, they want to abolish them and regular juries.
[2:37:01.680 --> 2:37:04.840]  You bet they want to abolish grand juries.
[2:37:04.840 --> 2:37:11.280]  My district attorney in Wise County once told me, those damn grand jury members, they think
[2:37:11.280 --> 2:37:12.880]  what they're doing is important.
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:14.680]  I said, well, Barry, it is.
[2:37:14.680 --> 2:37:20.360]  I know that, but I wish they didn't because he never knows what they're going to do.
[2:37:20.360 --> 2:37:23.680]  Well, I mean, I want to get into your solutions here, and how you do it.
[2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:27.200]  We've talked some about that in your website, but go back to Williamson County a few months
[2:37:27.200 --> 2:37:31.320]  ago, because you go to file this complaint on somebody's rights that violated and tell
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:33.520]  them what they did to you behind closed doors.
[2:37:33.520 --> 2:37:37.880]  Well, when the investigator came out and told me that the district attorney, tell them what
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:38.880]  department this was.
[2:37:38.880 --> 2:37:39.880]  Go through.
[2:37:39.880 --> 2:37:44.400]  This was, I went to the district attorney and handed his investigator a criminal complaint.
[2:37:44.400 --> 2:37:47.560]  If you go to the district attorney with a complaint, they'll always send you an investigator.
[2:37:47.560 --> 2:37:52.280]  So this is round rock or this was, we, uh, Georgetown, Georgetown, the city district
[2:37:52.280 --> 2:37:53.280]  attorney.
[2:37:53.280 --> 2:37:54.280]  Okay.
[2:37:54.280 --> 2:37:55.280]  No, the went to the county courthouse.
[2:37:55.280 --> 2:37:56.280]  Okay.
[2:37:56.280 --> 2:38:00.960]  So you went to the county of Williamson County, the county, the elected, the elected district
[2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:01.960]  attorney.
[2:38:01.960 --> 2:38:02.960]  Got a county seat.
[2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:03.960]  Yeah.
[2:38:03.960 --> 2:38:04.960]  I wanted the highest one in it.
[2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:05.960]  Got it.
[2:38:05.960 --> 2:38:06.960]  I just didn't know what jurisdiction.
[2:38:06.960 --> 2:38:07.960]  Go ahead.
[2:38:07.960 --> 2:38:10.160]  Complaints against public officials always go to district attorney, even if it's a class
[2:38:10.160 --> 2:38:13.000]  C misdemeanor by law.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:14.600]  So I filed a complaint.
[2:38:14.600 --> 2:38:16.200]  I try to file it with a district attorney.
[2:38:16.200 --> 2:38:18.120]  When you try to do that, they'll never talk to you.
[2:38:18.120 --> 2:38:19.960]  They'll send out their investigator.
[2:38:19.960 --> 2:38:22.160]  So I got this trick for them.
[2:38:22.160 --> 2:38:26.520]  I make up a criminal complaint and I asked the investigator, are you a certified police
[2:38:26.520 --> 2:38:27.520]  officer?
[2:38:27.520 --> 2:38:28.520]  And he said, yes, I am.
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:29.520]  Good.
[2:38:29.520 --> 2:38:30.520]  I need you here.
[2:38:30.520 --> 2:38:31.520]  Take this complaint and verify it.
[2:38:31.520 --> 2:38:35.400]  And it's a complaint against his boss and he'll say, well, I can't verify that.
[2:38:35.400 --> 2:38:39.720]  If you're a certified police officer, you're authorized to verify criminal affidavits.
[2:38:39.720 --> 2:38:40.720]  Verify that.
[2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:45.520]  The first thing he does is goes to his boss cause he's not even signing that document.
[2:38:45.520 --> 2:38:46.520]  So that gets rid of him.
[2:38:46.520 --> 2:38:51.600]  Well, he went to talk to the boss and came back and said, the boss declined my offer
[2:38:51.600 --> 2:38:55.120]  to file criminal charges against this other police officer.
[2:38:55.120 --> 2:38:59.400]  And I told him, I hate to hear that and took out my cell phone down 911, asked him to send
[2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:02.040]  an officer out here to arrest the both of them.
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:07.680]  Class A misdemeanor, official misconduct, violation 39.03, penal code, I'll square out
[2:39:07.680 --> 2:39:08.680]  the complaint.
[2:39:08.680 --> 2:39:09.680]  I'll wait.
[2:39:09.680 --> 2:39:10.680]  And that's the thing.
[2:39:10.680 --> 2:39:12.720]  They break the law.
[2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:17.680]  Go back and explain that when they drive you to the jail instead of to imagine and explain
[2:39:17.680 --> 2:39:18.680]  that.
[2:39:18.680 --> 2:39:19.680]  Okay.
[2:39:19.680 --> 2:39:20.680]  It's just all crime.
[2:39:20.680 --> 2:39:25.280]  It's said by our founders that the people not have a reason to fear their police.
[2:39:25.280 --> 2:39:30.600]  This was born out of the British running around arresting their own people for no reason.
[2:39:30.600 --> 2:39:34.880]  This thing of magistrates comes from Magna Carta, 1200s.
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:35.880]  1215.
[2:39:35.880 --> 2:39:37.400]  That was a good idea.
[2:39:37.400 --> 2:39:41.560]  They said the policeman should not have the key to the jailhouse door.
[2:39:41.560 --> 2:39:46.040]  You can arrest somebody, but you take him directly to a magistrate and you explain yourself.
[2:39:46.040 --> 2:39:47.040]  Separation of powers.
[2:39:47.040 --> 2:39:52.040]  It's not because they don't trust the policeman, but they want you to feel like the policeman
[2:39:52.040 --> 2:39:56.160]  didn't arrest him in prison that he can arrest, but he's going to take you to somebody else
[2:39:56.160 --> 2:39:57.160]  and explain himself.
[2:39:57.160 --> 2:39:59.040]  And that also gives him protection.
[2:39:59.040 --> 2:40:00.040]  Exactly.
[2:40:00.040 --> 2:40:03.440]  So in Wise County, they do that now and the police like it.
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:04.960]  So you've made them do that.
[2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:05.960]  Yes.
[2:40:05.960 --> 2:40:08.640]  It kind of came about, took a long time, but they finally do that.
[2:40:08.640 --> 2:40:09.920]  Everybody likes it better.
[2:40:09.920 --> 2:40:15.000]  I never hear anyone in Wise County tell me about the police being jackbooted thugs.
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:19.080]  That changed their whole perspective, though the policeman likes it better.
[2:40:19.080 --> 2:40:20.320]  The magistrate likes it better.
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:24.520]  Even the prosecutor likes it better because the magistrate throws out a lot of cases that
[2:40:24.520 --> 2:40:29.280]  so he don't have to deal with them, but that's what they were supposed to do.
[2:40:29.280 --> 2:40:32.160]  But over a period of time, just get lazy.
[2:40:32.160 --> 2:40:38.000]  They, well, I think the real problem is the legislature told the prosecutor to give advice
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:41.560]  to the judge, to the lower courts and the police.
[2:40:41.560 --> 2:40:44.920]  That's a prescription for exactly the disaster.
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:46.320]  We see today.
[2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:50.280]  You think the prosecutor's going to say to the judge, well, I think you should do this
[2:40:50.280 --> 2:40:52.920]  here because it will make my life a living hell.
[2:40:52.920 --> 2:41:00.280]  No, he's going to advise them to do things that make the prosecution flow more efficiently.
[2:41:00.280 --> 2:41:02.120]  And over time, we gravitate away.
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:03.720]  And now everything's plea bargain.
[2:41:03.720 --> 2:41:07.480]  And now they'll throw you in jail for five months before they even charge you.
[2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:09.960]  So they don't even have to eat to make you plea bargain.
[2:41:09.960 --> 2:41:14.360]  I looked at the criminal court records and the county I live in, I was looking at one
[2:41:14.360 --> 2:41:15.360]  of them.
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:17.360]  There's nothing in there, but the indictment and the deal.
[2:41:17.360 --> 2:41:18.360]  You can't tell he's been arrested.
[2:41:18.360 --> 2:41:20.520]  You can't tell anything in the deal.
[2:41:20.520 --> 2:41:24.200]  He got 457 days time served.
[2:41:24.200 --> 2:41:28.560]  He set in jail 457 days before they could squeeze a deal out of it.
[2:41:28.560 --> 2:41:33.440]  And he can only judge, no, jury, just, just you just go right to jail and they're God
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:37.200]  and not even any record in that at the court that you exist.
[2:41:37.200 --> 2:41:38.200]  He can't file motions.
[2:41:38.200 --> 2:41:39.200]  He can't do anything.
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:43.600]  He's in a legal limbo and that's because the magistrate doesn't send the records to
[2:41:43.600 --> 2:41:46.080]  the clerk, but back to the policeman.
[2:41:46.080 --> 2:41:49.440]  When he arrests you, he's supposed to take you to that magistrate.
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:55.000]  And according to the federal law, his only defense against an allegation of false imprisonment
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:59.600]  for timely failure to timely take before a magistrate is a showing of due diligence
[2:41:59.600 --> 2:42:03.720]  and effort to locate when he gets in that car cranks that car points it toward the jail
[2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:05.520]  as a matter of policy.
[2:42:05.520 --> 2:42:08.560]  That's aggravated kidnapping by definition.
[2:42:08.560 --> 2:42:14.000]  He violated a law relating to his office, he, his acts became false imprisonment, which
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:19.680]  is in Texas, it's called kidnapping and he did it whilst displaying a deadly weapon that
[2:42:19.680 --> 2:42:21.720]  makes it aggravated kidnapping.
[2:42:21.720 --> 2:42:24.520]  He took me and gave me to the jailers.
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:27.440]  They continued the kidnapping.
[2:42:27.440 --> 2:42:28.880]  They touched the tar baby.
[2:42:28.880 --> 2:42:31.080]  They don't just exceed their authority.
[2:42:31.080 --> 2:42:33.240]  Now, now what do you do about police now?
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:37.080]  A lot of them seem to think that they'll go ahead of you, argue with them and Taser you
[2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:40.200]  and then they bump their chest into you or don't even do that now and just charge you
[2:42:40.200 --> 2:42:41.360]  with assaulting them.
[2:42:41.360 --> 2:42:42.880]  What would you do with a case like that?
[2:42:42.880 --> 2:42:45.240]  That's what happened to me.
[2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:47.240]  And that's why they arrested me.
[2:42:47.240 --> 2:42:50.120]  And I was really upset when they dismissed the charges.
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:53.560]  I wanted him on the stand on the stand.
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:42:58.520]  I'd elicit perjure testimony and ask that judge to have him arrested immediately.
[2:42:58.520 --> 2:43:01.280]  But they arrested me and took me into it.
[2:43:01.280 --> 2:43:04.400]  First they, they went into this conference room.
[2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:07.720]  Oh, yeah, and we'll finish up with what happened in Williamson County, the assault began.
[2:43:07.720 --> 2:43:09.400]  I gave them a, I gave them the complaint.
[2:43:09.400 --> 2:43:10.400]  Okay.
[2:43:10.400 --> 2:43:11.400]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2:43:11.400 --> 2:43:13.960]  And he said the complaint was insufficient.
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:18.480]  I said, well, thank you anyway, but I don't need any legal advice.
[2:43:18.480 --> 2:43:23.920]  And they got real excited about that and started grilling me and I finally told them this interview
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:28.360]  is over and started to leave and they grabbed me and threw me in a chair.
[2:43:28.360 --> 2:43:29.680]  Just total third world country.
[2:43:29.680 --> 2:43:30.680]  Yes.
[2:43:30.680 --> 2:43:31.680]  Reach for my cell phone.
[2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:35.120]  I grabbed my arm, twisted it, ripped my cell phone out of my hand.
[2:43:35.120 --> 2:43:38.120]  I told him, I need that to call 911.
[2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:39.680]  They said, we are 911.
[2:43:39.680 --> 2:43:41.960]  No, you're jackbooted thugs.
[2:43:41.960 --> 2:43:43.960]  I need 911.
[2:43:43.960 --> 2:43:48.880]  Well, by that time, Michael, Michael, Ben Eric was there.
[2:43:48.880 --> 2:43:52.560]  He kind of backed up in a corner.
[2:43:52.560 --> 2:43:55.160]  The third time witness to this vampiric behavior.
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:43:56.160]  Yes.
[2:43:56.160 --> 2:43:59.840]  The third time they threw me in the chair, the police officer had his hand on my chest
[2:43:59.840 --> 2:44:01.560]  pushing me backwards.
[2:44:01.560 --> 2:44:04.720]  I reached up and pushed his hand off and they arrested me for assault.
[2:44:04.720 --> 2:44:07.800]  So they assault you and if you defend yourself here, I'll cut it.
[2:44:07.800 --> 2:44:08.800]  Exactly.
[2:44:08.800 --> 2:44:09.800]  So where's that going?
[2:44:09.800 --> 2:44:10.800]  They've dropped it.
[2:44:10.800 --> 2:44:12.120]  They've dropped it and I'm upset about it.
[2:44:12.120 --> 2:44:14.680]  The prosecuting attorney dropped the charge.
[2:44:14.680 --> 2:44:17.680]  What a circus behind closed doors with these crazies.
[2:44:17.680 --> 2:44:19.680]  Well, they're not done yet.
[2:44:19.680 --> 2:44:22.200]  Actually, Deborah helped me out on this one.
[2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:27.160]  I went to the county attorney because they dropped the interference of the public servant
[2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:28.640]  charge.
[2:44:28.640 --> 2:44:32.400]  And I had went to the court clerk and there's no record with the court clerk that I was
[2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:33.400]  ever arrested.
[2:44:33.400 --> 2:44:38.080]  So I asked the prosecuting attorney, who dropped these charges?
[2:44:38.080 --> 2:44:39.240]  He said, well, I did.
[2:44:39.240 --> 2:44:42.000]  Well, how did you manage to drop them?
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:44.240]  There's no record in the court clerk they exist.
[2:44:44.240 --> 2:44:48.160]  Well, I dropped them in my capacity as a prosecuting attorney.
[2:44:48.160 --> 2:44:51.840]  I told him, well, that's all well and good, but I was hoping for something more specific
[2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:57.240]  like 32.02 code of criminal procedure, which says a prosecuting attorney may not dismiss
[2:44:57.240 --> 2:45:00.800]  a prosecution except by submission of written motion to the court of jurisdiction laying
[2:45:00.800 --> 2:45:01.800]  down causes.
[2:45:01.800 --> 2:45:02.800]  Why they did it?
[2:45:02.800 --> 2:45:04.520]  Because for all we know, he could have been paid off to do it.
[2:45:04.520 --> 2:45:05.520]  You got to have a record.
[2:45:05.520 --> 2:45:06.520]  Yeah.
[2:45:06.520 --> 2:45:07.520]  So what heck did you get this?
[2:45:07.520 --> 2:45:11.480]  He said, well, a prosecution never started because I refused to take it.
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:12.760]  I said, wait a minute.
[2:45:12.760 --> 2:45:15.440]  I thought I spent 29 hours in your jail.
[2:45:15.440 --> 2:45:19.920]  And as I read the case law, a prosecution commences when a person is arrested or a criminal
[2:45:19.920 --> 2:45:24.920]  complaints presented to a magistrate, which had to be for him to find probable cause.
[2:45:24.920 --> 2:45:28.840]  So a prosecution commenced, you dismissed it.
[2:45:28.840 --> 2:45:31.120]  How did you even know it existed?
[2:45:31.120 --> 2:45:34.680]  Because the magistrate was supposed to send the records to the court clerk.
[2:45:34.680 --> 2:45:37.440]  How did you know the court clerk doesn't have them?
[2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:42.480]  So whoever has them has them in violation of 3710 penal code and they're committing
[2:45:42.480 --> 2:45:43.480]  a felony.
[2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:44.480]  Have you got those records?
[2:45:44.480 --> 2:45:47.720]  And he looked like a cat with a feather in his mouth.
[2:45:47.720 --> 2:45:52.940]  And Deborah, Deborah was standing behind me, Deborah, that's my co-host, Deborah Stevens.
[2:45:52.940 --> 2:45:56.480]  She stepped up and said, Randy, aren't you talking about the records that were supposed
[2:45:56.480 --> 2:45:57.480]  to go to the magistrate?
[2:45:57.480 --> 2:45:58.480]  And I said, yes.
[2:45:58.480 --> 2:45:59.640]  Well, look at that folder.
[2:45:59.640 --> 2:46:00.840]  He's gotten his hand there.
[2:46:00.840 --> 2:46:02.840]  Isn't that those records?
[2:46:02.840 --> 2:46:06.280]  And this prosecutor looked like he wanted a hole to crawl in.
[2:46:06.280 --> 2:46:09.840]  And she said, are any of those records in there from the magistrate?
[2:46:09.840 --> 2:46:12.560]  Well, yes, one of them.
[2:46:12.560 --> 2:46:15.560]  And Deborah shut up, stepped back.
[2:46:15.560 --> 2:46:18.800]  And for Deborah to stop talking abruptly, I thought that was rather strange.
[2:46:18.800 --> 2:46:23.700]  And I looked back at her, it wasn't until later I realized what she had done.
[2:46:23.700 --> 2:46:27.240]  She got the prosecutor to cop to a felony.
[2:46:27.240 --> 2:46:32.560]  And once she got it, she didn't pursue anymore, so he wouldn't have a chance to talk his way
[2:46:32.560 --> 2:46:33.960]  out of it.
[2:46:33.960 --> 2:46:38.720]  So I'll be filing felony tampering with the government document against the prosecutor
[2:46:38.720 --> 2:46:41.200]  for having my records.
[2:46:41.200 --> 2:46:42.200]  Let him explain.
[2:46:42.200 --> 2:46:46.680]  But see, they love to have false charges and set up old ladies and young kids.
[2:46:46.680 --> 2:46:50.280]  They get to have some of their own sick medicine, but you're doing it within the law.
[2:46:50.280 --> 2:46:51.280]  Yes.
[2:46:51.280 --> 2:46:56.080]  Oh, they hate this because they know I will go directly to the grand jury.
[2:46:56.080 --> 2:47:01.800]  Now, rather I actually get to the grand jury or not, it's not so important.
[2:47:01.800 --> 2:47:07.600]  Just making grand jury noises is scary stuff, but Jesus out of these guys, they see their
[2:47:07.600 --> 2:47:10.480]  career flash before their eyes.
[2:47:10.480 --> 2:47:15.920]  The odds are that I'm not going to get an indictment, but who wants to play Russian
[2:47:15.920 --> 2:47:16.920]  roulette?
[2:47:16.920 --> 2:47:21.120]  But getting back to their psychology, I don't know how they have, like in their minds, think
[2:47:21.120 --> 2:47:25.560]  we're like lumps of meat and aren't humans with, with lives and careers and ideas and
[2:47:25.560 --> 2:47:27.160]  hopes and dreams.
[2:47:27.160 --> 2:47:30.760]  I mean, it was crazy when the New York cops took me behind there and said, we're going
[2:47:30.760 --> 2:47:33.320]  to say you hit one of us and they weren't messing with me.
[2:47:33.320 --> 2:47:36.560]  And I said, there's a lot of cameras out there and they go, no, we're talking about in here.
[2:47:36.560 --> 2:47:38.520]  And I just said, I said, you know, do what you need to.
[2:47:38.520 --> 2:47:42.280]  But I said, I'm not, I said, I'm a big fish and I'm going to see, you know, you can,
[2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:44.360]  you can beat the rap, but you're not going to beat the ride.
[2:47:44.360 --> 2:47:47.680]  And they just said, all right, you know, tough guy, they wouldn't put me in a cell with human
[2:47:47.680 --> 2:47:50.520]  feces everywhere when they had other cells that were clean.
[2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:52.280]  But I mean, who wants that type of power?
[2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:53.280]  I would be embarrassed.
[2:47:53.280 --> 2:47:59.600]  I mean, I, I'm not like mean to my employees on purpose for a personal power trip, but
[2:47:59.600 --> 2:48:02.640]  I guess that's who, and let's, let's admit it in some cases, that's who wants to be a
[2:48:02.640 --> 2:48:04.000]  cop or a judge.
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  Yeah.
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:09.720]  That's, that's part of the, I mean, they really enjoy squeezing people and I've had enough
[2:48:09.720 --> 2:48:10.720]  of it.
[2:48:10.720 --> 2:48:13.920]  But there, there's a lot of them out there that aren't that way.
[2:48:13.920 --> 2:48:18.760]  We just have to give them an opportunity to stand up and it's unfortunate.
[2:48:18.760 --> 2:48:23.280]  The way we give them that opportunity is kick them right square and they're behind.
[2:48:23.280 --> 2:48:26.080]  It's, I, I equate that to my grandchildren.
[2:48:26.080 --> 2:48:30.800]  I love my grandchildren dearly, but if one of them runs out in the road, I'm fixing
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:31.800]  10.
[2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:32.800]  He's hot.
[2:48:32.800 --> 2:48:37.720]  And when you do this kind of thing, I suggest that people don't go file complaints in your
[2:48:37.720 --> 2:48:39.480]  own case.
[2:48:39.480 --> 2:48:41.720]  You got too much involved.
[2:48:41.720 --> 2:48:45.920]  If you, if you want to find out how this works, go pick a fight or a traffic ticket.
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:48.740]  I mean, what do you want to lose at a traffic ticket?
[2:48:48.740 --> 2:48:52.840]  If you lose, they're going to do the same thing that would do to you anyway.
[2:48:52.840 --> 2:48:54.960]  So heck, there's nothing to lose.
[2:48:54.960 --> 2:48:56.920]  Traffic traffic tickets are great fun.
[2:48:56.920 --> 2:48:59.920]  My last traffic ticket was in Belle County.
[2:48:59.920 --> 2:49:05.240]  I asked the bailiff to drag the judge down off the bench three different times and they
[2:49:05.240 --> 2:49:07.520]  told the judge, get down off that bench.
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:08.520]  You're disqualified.
[2:49:08.520 --> 2:49:11.240]  He jumped up, clear the jury, clear the jury.
[2:49:11.240 --> 2:49:12.840]  It was a hoot.
[2:49:12.840 --> 2:49:13.840]  What happened there?
[2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:19.960]  Oh, the jury found me incredibly guilty, but I was, I told him when we, before we told
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:23.440]  the jury panel that these guys are going to get up here and they're going to put a officer
[2:49:23.440 --> 2:49:27.480]  up here and he's going to say that he clocked me doing 80 miles an hour and a 65 mile an
[2:49:27.480 --> 2:49:28.480]  hour zone.
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:30.440]  And he did.
[2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:31.440]  I was doing it.
[2:49:31.440 --> 2:49:32.680]  Well, then why'd you do this case then?
[2:49:32.680 --> 2:49:35.480]  I'm here because they're bigger criminals than me.
[2:49:35.480 --> 2:49:40.160]  They have no authority to prosecute me because they're really the criminals and all the prosecutor
[2:49:40.160 --> 2:49:41.160]  had a fit.
[2:49:41.160 --> 2:49:42.560]  Now, so you did it as an educational?
[2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:43.560]  Yes.
[2:49:43.560 --> 2:49:45.040]  And then what did you teach the jury?
[2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:53.560]  I had a motion to disqualify the judge before the court and he turned it down himself.
[2:49:53.560 --> 2:49:54.560]  That's a crime.
[2:49:54.560 --> 2:49:56.560]  No, they have to let another judge look at that, don't they?
[2:49:56.560 --> 2:49:57.560]  Exactly.
[2:49:57.560 --> 2:50:03.560]  Motion to recuse the judge can deny himself, but a motion to disqualify he cannot, but
[2:50:03.560 --> 2:50:04.920]  he did.
[2:50:04.920 --> 2:50:10.280]  And then after that, the first thing I did was ask the policeman when he signed his
[2:50:10.280 --> 2:50:12.520]  last oath of office.
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:13.920]  Prosecutor objected.
[2:50:13.920 --> 2:50:14.920]  The judge sustained.
[2:50:14.920 --> 2:50:19.240]  I said, your honor, I have a right to test the credibility of this witness.
[2:50:19.240 --> 2:50:21.920]  The judge said, well, Mr. Kelton, this witness is credible.
[2:50:21.920 --> 2:50:24.200]  And just how did this witness become credible?
[2:50:24.200 --> 2:50:27.160]  He's credible because I say he's credible.
[2:50:27.160 --> 2:50:28.640]  Mr. Bayliff, did you hear that?
[2:50:28.640 --> 2:50:30.560]  Yes, Mr. Kelton, I did.
[2:50:30.560 --> 2:50:35.080]  Take that judge down off that bench, judge, you get down off that bench, you are disqualified.
[2:50:35.080 --> 2:50:37.400]  We're doing the break for prisonpointer.tv.
[2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:38.400]  Tell us what happened.
[2:50:38.400 --> 2:50:42.400]  We'll come back, finish up, tell folks, are you going to be having a seminar anytime soon?
[2:50:42.400 --> 2:50:43.400]  I hope to.
[2:50:43.400 --> 2:50:44.400]  We don't have any.
[2:50:44.400 --> 2:50:45.400]  Well, good.
[2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:46.400]  Well, when that's coming up, we'll plug it here.
[2:50:46.400 --> 2:50:48.840]  We'll have you back on.
[2:50:48.840 --> 2:50:52.840]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant
[2:50:52.840 --> 2:50:57.560]  can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[2:50:57.560 --> 2:51:02.960]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S. and
[2:51:02.960 --> 2:51:03.960]  Canada.
[2:51:03.960 --> 2:51:09.120]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified
[2:51:09.120 --> 2:51:10.640]  THC-free.
[2:51:10.640 --> 2:51:14.200]  Our powder is 50 percent protein and does not contain gluten.
[2:51:14.200 --> 2:51:16.560]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[2:52:03.520 --> 2:52:06.680]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[2:52:06.680 --> 2:52:11.680]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[2:52:11.680 --> 2:52:19.640]  80 percent of humanity is at hand.
[2:52:19.640 --> 2:52:22.480]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[2:52:42.800 --> 2:52:43.800]  You have been warned.
[2:52:43.800 --> 2:52:52.760]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[2:52:52.760 --> 2:52:56.960]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[2:52:56.960 --> 2:53:01.880]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[2:53:01.880 --> 2:53:05.560]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:53:05.560 --> 2:53:10.080]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[2:53:10.080 --> 2:53:11.080]  across America.
[2:53:11.080 --> 2:53:12.080]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[2:53:12.080 --> 2:53:13.080]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:14.080]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[2:53:14.080 --> 2:53:15.080]  healthier I feel.
[2:53:15.080 --> 2:53:16.080]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:53:16.080 --> 2:53:17.080]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[2:53:17.080 --> 2:53:30.080]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[2:53:30.080 --> 2:53:56.080]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[2:53:56.080 --> 2:54:16.200]  a war on for your mind.
[2:54:16.200 --> 2:54:21.720]  You were just telling me during the break about in your own town with the judge threatening
[2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:23.280]  you and you pulled out the recorder.
[2:54:23.280 --> 2:54:28.480]  You said all of them hate me except the county attorney, and I've been after them a long time.
[2:54:28.480 --> 2:54:32.680]  I never got anybody arrested in Wise County, never got anybody indicted, never even got
[2:54:32.680 --> 2:54:37.960]  anyone presented to the grand jury, but they do take every one they arrest directly to
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:44.240]  the nearest magistrate, and that's because I just kept harassing them.
[2:54:44.240 --> 2:54:50.840]  I didn't get them indicted, but I was always so close, they're literally playing Russian
[2:54:50.840 --> 2:54:51.840]  roulette with me.
[2:54:51.840 --> 2:54:55.440]  And I was just telling the story the last time I spoke to my district judge.
[2:54:55.440 --> 2:55:00.800]  I was in his courtroom talking to his bailiff, and he ran in and said, Mr. Colton, you're
[2:55:00.800 --> 2:55:04.840]  creating a disturbance, you get out of this courthouse, or I'll have you arrested.
[2:55:04.840 --> 2:55:08.000]  I reached in my pocket, I said, I'm sorry, judge, I didn't have this turned on, pulled
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:12.960]  out a little digital recorder, clicked it on, stuck it in his face and said, will you
[2:55:12.960 --> 2:55:14.760]  say that again?
[2:55:14.760 --> 2:55:19.000]  And he was looked at me, was breathing hard, and I know what he was thinking.
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:24.880]  That damn district attorney, he didn't tell me everything, and the judge was right.
[2:55:24.880 --> 2:55:28.480]  I was talking to the bailiff because the high sheriff of the county sent me to talk
[2:55:28.480 --> 2:55:34.200]  to the bailiff in order to file criminal charges against the district attorney.
[2:55:34.200 --> 2:55:37.400]  The district attorney told the judge I was creating a disturbance.
[2:55:37.400 --> 2:55:43.560]  I filed making a terroristic threat against the district judge with the attorney general.
[2:55:43.560 --> 2:55:47.960]  The only time the attorney general is the prosecutor of original jurisdiction is in
[2:55:47.960 --> 2:55:52.640]  a matter of a complaint against a district attorney under open records.
[2:55:52.640 --> 2:55:56.760]  But how did it get so corrupt all over the country where none of them follow proper procedure,
[2:55:56.760 --> 2:56:00.360]  none of them follow the state and federal law, they just do whatever they want?
[2:56:00.360 --> 2:56:05.960]  I have a document on my website I call the Frog Farm Conspiracy.
[2:56:05.960 --> 2:56:09.840]  And the reason I call it that is Samuel Clements once said, you take frog, throw him in a pot
[2:56:09.840 --> 2:56:11.800]  of hot water, he'd jump out.
[2:56:11.800 --> 2:56:17.640]  Take that same frog, put him in a pot of cold water, gradually raise the heat.
[2:56:17.640 --> 2:56:24.200]  Well, over time, through a series of seemingly minor adjustments toward administrative convenience
[2:56:24.200 --> 2:56:32.120]  and adjudicative expediency, we took one little step out after another outside the legal limits.
[2:56:32.120 --> 2:56:36.280]  And then one day we look around and wonder how we got in this mess.
[2:56:36.280 --> 2:56:43.200]  And it's bad, but on the other hand, because it's so bad, it gives us a lot more power
[2:56:43.200 --> 2:56:45.120]  in changing it.
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:50.320]  They are so far away from rule of law, they have zero defense.
[2:56:50.320 --> 2:56:53.640]  And all we have to do is keep hammering them.
[2:56:53.640 --> 2:56:56.440]  Right now I'm just one person.
[2:56:56.440 --> 2:57:02.080]  And just one person, I've got all of the judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals wondering
[2:57:02.080 --> 2:57:05.440]  if they're going to get indicted.
[2:57:05.440 --> 2:57:08.560]  That's extremely powerful, even if I don't get them indicted.
[2:57:08.560 --> 2:57:11.800]  Well, I mean, here's an example, I want to hold you over five minutes so we can in the
[2:57:11.800 --> 2:57:16.560]  next hour, then we're going to get Senator Karen Johnson on for a 15-plus minute interview
[2:57:16.560 --> 2:57:20.320]  and take calls, listeners, on 9-11 and all these big developments that have happened
[2:57:20.320 --> 2:57:21.320]  there.
[2:57:21.320 --> 2:57:24.360]  But when we come back, I want you to answer this for me in the five minutes we've got
[2:57:24.360 --> 2:57:25.360]  left.
[2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:27.880]  Here's an example of what we did.
[2:57:27.880 --> 2:57:36.080]  With the Abston Student Assistance Program, ASAP, in 98-99, if your child didn't go to
[2:57:36.080 --> 2:57:40.160]  school one morning with the flu and you had the flu or forgot to call, the police would
[2:57:40.160 --> 2:57:44.560]  come, demand in, threaten parents, they would arrest you.
[2:57:44.560 --> 2:57:48.520]  But truancy was 14 absences, unexcused in a semester.
[2:57:48.520 --> 2:57:53.400]  So we went to the county commissioners' court and would read the law and say, and then we
[2:57:53.400 --> 2:58:00.480]  found out that they would take three late, you know, sixth graders being late to class
[2:58:00.480 --> 2:58:04.200]  three times and call that an absence, and they would bring them into these little portable
[2:58:04.200 --> 2:58:08.120]  buildings and say, but it wasn't real court, we got video of it, they would just say, sign
[2:58:08.120 --> 2:58:12.520]  a document, we're signing them on a probation to be a contract fraud, and we cut back on
[2:58:12.520 --> 2:58:13.520]  some of that.
[2:58:13.520 --> 2:58:14.520]  Now they're back with it.
[2:58:14.520 --> 2:58:15.520]  I mean, I can't fight everything.
[2:58:15.520 --> 2:58:21.360]  But the point is, it's not even laws, I mean, it's all fraud, so what about contract fraud
[2:58:21.360 --> 2:58:22.360]  with you?
[2:58:22.360 --> 2:58:25.240]  You're talking about how to keep them accountable, I mean, just for the average public to know
[2:58:25.240 --> 2:58:39.360]  that government is criminal, stop trusting them.
[2:58:39.360 --> 2:58:43.840]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes
[2:58:43.840 --> 2:58:50.040]  the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely
[2:58:50.040 --> 2:58:52.440]  destroys the official fable forever.

[2:58:56.840 --> 2:59:01.640]  family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[2:59:01.640 --> 2:59:03.520]  crime are brought to justice.
[2:59:03.520 --> 2:59:07.040]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[2:59:07.040 --> 2:59:11.480]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change
[2:59:11.480 --> 2:59:14.880]  Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[3:04:49.640 --> 3:04:54.640]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:04:54.640 --> 3:05:00.640]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[3:05:00.640 --> 3:05:13.640]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[3:08:04.640 --> 3:08:09.640]  Okay, I was so busy during the break doing so much. I forgot to ask if we have our next great guest lined up, John.
[3:08:09.640 --> 3:08:16.640]  Fantastic. We are live, ladies and gentlemen, now well into this fourth hour.
[3:08:16.640 --> 3:08:21.640]  And we just had a real character in studio with this really nice fellow, Randy Kelton.
[3:08:21.640 --> 3:08:30.640]  We have State Senator Karen Johnson on with us, former CIA briefer and top analyst for Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[3:08:30.640 --> 3:08:34.640]  Will be joining us Friday. I just thought I'd tell you that guest is confirmed.
[3:08:34.640 --> 3:08:40.640]  We have some other big guests lined up that will remain secret until they're on air with us later this week.
[3:08:40.640 --> 3:08:50.640]  Going to Karen Johnson, who's just an amazing lady and has taken a lot of heat for coming out and questioning the official 9-11 fairy tale.
[3:08:50.640 --> 3:08:55.640]  Karen, Jesse Ventura has gone further on this show and other shows the last two days.
[3:08:55.640 --> 3:09:04.640]  He thinks 9-11 was partially an insurance fraud blowing up the buildings and that he believes our government may have done it, not just that he thinks we're being lied to.
[3:09:04.640 --> 3:09:12.640]  You can love him, you can hate him. The point is it takes courage to do this and it's really starting to break into the mainstream media. What do you think about this?
[3:09:12.640 --> 3:09:22.640]  Well, I absolutely think that Jesse Ventura has courage. That is for sure. I often wonder what Mr. Larry Silverstein is doing these days.
[3:09:22.640 --> 3:09:30.640]  Oh, he just now got some new multi-billion dollar settlement and he's suing, I think, for $12 billion to get even more.
[3:09:30.640 --> 3:09:37.640]  I mean, he is doing quite nicely on a $189 million investment made two months before the attacks.
[3:09:37.640 --> 3:09:41.640]  Yeah, that's quite interesting.
[3:09:41.640 --> 3:09:48.640]  Well, it's just amazing is what it is. I wanted to get you on for most of an hour to take phone calls for folks that wanted to talk about 9-11.
[3:09:48.640 --> 3:09:55.640]  It's a perfect day to do it with all the things that are breaking at 1-800-259-9231.
[3:09:55.640 --> 3:10:09.640]  But I wanted to, with you, talk about, I mean, you said day one, you questioned the official story, but I also wanted to walk through some of the main points that you think people should look at, Senator.
[3:10:09.640 --> 3:10:18.640]  Well, first of all, if I can, Alex, I want to tell you about something that we are proposing to do out here in the Phoenix area.
[3:10:18.640 --> 3:10:27.640]  I'm very, very excited about it. We had what we call a 9-11 meetup group last night, and there is a gentleman by the name of Blaine,
[3:10:27.640 --> 3:10:41.640]  who is going to do what we're calling hunger for truth, and he is going to do a fast that he is beginning out in front of Senator John McCain's office on Memorial Day.
[3:10:41.640 --> 3:10:47.640]  He will begin that this coming Monday on Memorial Day and go as long as he can.
[3:10:47.640 --> 3:11:00.640]  You know, hopefully he won't have to go more than a couple weeks. What he's asking for is two hours of Senator McCain's time to try and show him the realities of 9-11,
[3:11:00.640 --> 3:11:07.640]  the real truth that's going on there. And there's going to be some complementary things going on around the country,
[3:11:07.640 --> 3:11:18.640]  like also at Barack Obama's office in Chicago, at Hillary Clinton's office in New York, even Nancy Pelosi's office in San Francisco.
[3:11:18.640 --> 3:11:30.640]  So these areas are also going to be targeted with 9-11 people for truth that are trying to give these legislators to open up their eyes
[3:11:30.640 --> 3:11:41.640]  why they can't see that there were more than two buildings that fell and one wasn't even hit by a plane is beyond me.
[3:11:41.640 --> 3:11:44.640]  Tell us more about that, Senator.
[3:11:44.640 --> 3:11:55.640]  Well, you know, if you trust your eyes, you just look at the pictures, you can see that building 7 is falling down, not because it was hit by a plane,
[3:11:55.640 --> 3:12:03.640]  but because of explosions, because of demolitions. And, you know, how do you account for that?
[3:12:03.640 --> 3:12:15.640]  Well, you know, we didn't play all of this. It's about three minutes long. If it's okay, would you like to hear Jesse Ventura on that rascal Howard Stern this morning?
[3:12:15.640 --> 3:12:22.640]  They attacked him because of his appearance here yesterday and a month and a half ago when he first went public saying it's an inside job.
[3:12:22.640 --> 3:12:30.640]  And he went further than ever here and I want you to respond to the disinfo. That's why we're playing this clip so we can critique it and analyze it for fair use here.
[3:12:30.640 --> 3:12:34.640]  But I want to get your take on that. You're going to listen to this, right?
[3:12:34.640 --> 3:12:36.640]  Sure, you bet.
[3:12:36.640 --> 3:12:38.640]  Okay, go ahead and roll it.
[3:12:38.640 --> 3:12:44.640]  Hey, you're one of those guys who believes, you know, that 9-11, that you don't believe two planes knocked down three buildings, right?
[3:12:44.640 --> 3:12:54.640]  Well, I believed it when it happened and then after I got out of office, my son kept badgering me to pay attention to these things on the Internet.
[3:12:54.640 --> 3:13:02.640]  And I finally did and I started studying it and I started opening my eyes a little. And there's a lot of very difficult questions that have not been answered.
[3:13:02.640 --> 3:13:04.640]  No one seems to want to provide an answer.
[3:13:04.640 --> 3:13:06.640]  What's the most difficult question that you see?
[3:13:06.640 --> 3:13:13.640]  Well, that a third building could fall into its own footprint five hours later, having not been struck by much of anything.
[3:13:13.640 --> 3:13:15.640]  So what do you think happened?
[3:13:15.640 --> 3:13:19.640]  One story's high. How did that happen? The 9-11 Commission didn't even address the issue.
[3:13:19.640 --> 3:13:21.640]  So what do you think happened?
[3:13:21.640 --> 3:13:26.640]  I hate to fear what could have happened that possibly we did it to ourselves.
[3:13:26.640 --> 3:13:28.640]  You're kidding me.
[3:13:28.640 --> 3:13:35.640]  Well, Howard, I worked in demolition that was trained by the best guys in the United States Navy being a frogman.
[3:13:35.640 --> 3:13:39.640]  And how could those buildings fall at the rate of gravity?
[3:13:39.640 --> 3:13:50.640]  Well, let me ask you something. It seems to me, I don't know much about this, but when jets go right into a building, couldn't there be so much trauma to the area that things can fall?
[3:13:50.640 --> 3:13:59.640]  No, because if you study how they built the buildings, those buildings were made to withstand the 707, which is that old plane with the four engines on the wing.
[3:13:59.640 --> 3:14:00.640]  Right.
[3:14:00.640 --> 3:14:05.640]  Well, that's as big as what hit it. And by my studying, it was built to it.
[3:14:05.640 --> 3:14:11.640]  And then I'll get the senator's comment talking to Senator Karen Johnson from Arizona.
[3:14:11.640 --> 3:14:20.640]  I actually have played clips of Namuru Yamasaki, the designer, the architect, and the structural engineer.
[3:14:20.640 --> 3:14:26.640]  I forget his exact title. He was the head engineer over its actual construction, the construction engineer.
[3:14:26.640 --> 3:14:37.640]  And he went public. We have the club we can play again, I guess, where he says it was designed to take two strikes per tower of a plane as big or bigger.
[3:14:37.640 --> 3:14:41.640]  I mean, it's just ridiculous. Would you like to comment on that?
[3:14:41.640 --> 3:14:49.640]  Well, Alex, I definitely agree. You know, when you look at building seven, I think it was 47 stories.
[3:14:49.640 --> 3:15:01.640]  The twin towers were approximately 110. And from what we were able to observe over and over and over, those planes hit close to the top of those towers.
[3:15:01.640 --> 3:15:08.640]  And, you know, I can see the top part of it perhaps toppling over, but there is no way.
[3:15:08.640 --> 3:15:14.640]  Fires burn up. They don't burn down. And for that, at least, I mean, I'm no expert on this.
[3:15:14.640 --> 3:15:27.640]  But to have it go all the way down, a fire from jet fuel, which doesn't even burn hot enough to melt steel, to burn all the way down, and, you know...
[3:15:27.640 --> 3:15:38.640]  Well, then we have the NASA and FBI photos from aircraft and space showing 2,600 plus degrees, close to 1,000 degrees hotter than jet fuel does at its hottest.
[3:15:38.640 --> 3:15:46.640]  This is insane. This is absolutely amazing. And the firefighters reported molten steel flowing like lava down in there.
[3:15:46.640 --> 3:15:54.640]  And then you have BBC reporting that building seven fell 25 minutes before it fell and giving the exact official story of how it then...
[3:15:54.640 --> 3:16:02.640]  I mean, that's like with the JFK murder, how New Zealand and Australia and Thailand and others reported before they even announced in the U.S. are caught him.
[3:16:02.640 --> 3:16:06.640]  That it was Lee Harvey Oswald and he'd done it because they got their time zones off.
[3:16:06.640 --> 3:16:16.640]  You are right on, Alex. I still, you know, I've got a picture of that gal reporter from the BBC and she reported, I think, about 5 p.m.
[3:16:16.640 --> 3:16:24.640]  That building seven had already collapsed and it didn't collapse until 5.20 and it's in... You can see it behind her still standing.
[3:16:24.640 --> 3:16:26.640]  I mean, what's going on here?
[3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:29.640]  Well, I think we've done the best presentation of that in the new edition of Terror Storm.
[3:16:29.640 --> 3:16:32.640]  I hope people get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:16:32.640 --> 3:16:40.640]  Karen, I mean, I don't want to focus on how you've been attacked because, you know, for all the attacks you've been loved a million times more.
[3:16:40.640 --> 3:16:46.640]  I mean, even the polls show the majority of people know it's an inside job now, not just, you know, that they're being lied to.
[3:16:46.640 --> 3:16:52.640]  But what's... I mean, the ridiculous attacks you've been under and the things that some local papers have said.
[3:16:52.640 --> 3:16:55.640]  I mean, it's really sophomoric and that's why they're losing all their subscribers.
[3:16:55.640 --> 3:16:58.640]  That's why the mainstream corporate media is falling apart.
[3:16:58.640 --> 3:17:00.640]  So, in a way, they're just destroying themselves.
[3:17:00.640 --> 3:17:03.640]  And, Alex, you're right about that.
[3:17:03.640 --> 3:17:06.640]  And to me, that is what is so encouraging today.
[3:17:06.640 --> 3:17:13.640]  I cannot tell you the amount of email that I have gotten from people that are going, hey, we think you're right.
[3:17:13.640 --> 3:17:14.640]  We want to help.
[3:17:14.640 --> 3:17:15.640]  We want to look into this.
[3:17:15.640 --> 3:17:27.640]  My wonderful Able Assistant, you know, is beginning to put together, you know, a whole directory of these folks so that we can keep in touch with them.
[3:17:27.640 --> 3:17:30.640]  Now, I'm not saying that we don't get some pretty nasty ones.
[3:17:30.640 --> 3:17:36.640]  I got one recently from some Republican, you know, that's trying to get me thrown out of the party.
[3:17:36.640 --> 3:17:38.640]  And I'm thinking, you don't have to worry about that.
[3:17:38.640 --> 3:17:40.640]  I could leave myself pretty easy.
[3:17:40.640 --> 3:17:41.640]  Hey, don't worry.
[3:17:41.640 --> 3:17:49.640]  The Republicans that guy likes are for open borders, total gun control, amnesty, giant taxes, triple BATF.
[3:17:49.640 --> 3:17:51.640]  Our name destroyed.
[3:17:51.640 --> 3:17:52.640]  Our dollar destroyed.
[3:17:52.640 --> 3:17:54.640]  John McCain, a total communist.
[3:17:54.640 --> 3:17:56.640]  I mean, they ought to be happy.
[3:17:56.640 --> 3:17:57.640]  Don't worry.
[3:17:57.640 --> 3:17:59.640]  Real Republicans like you are very rare now.
[3:17:59.640 --> 3:18:00.640]  Oh, my gosh.
[3:18:00.640 --> 3:18:08.640]  We do have a pretty good wing here in Arizona that, you know, we're staunchly behind Ron Paul, and we still are.
[3:18:08.640 --> 3:18:09.640]  No, I know that.
[3:18:09.640 --> 3:18:15.640]  But I mean, in the highest power positions, they're, I mean, of course, the party would win and take over if you were constitutionalists,
[3:18:15.640 --> 3:18:20.640]  but they act like wonderful people like you are bad instead of the leadership.
[3:18:20.640 --> 3:18:21.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:18:21.640 --> 3:18:22.640]  Exactly.
[3:18:22.640 --> 3:18:23.640]  We're nothing.
[3:18:23.640 --> 3:18:24.640]  We're non-entities.
[3:18:24.640 --> 3:18:29.640]  And it's pretty sad, but the people themselves are out there, Alex.
[3:18:29.640 --> 3:18:31.640]  They listen to folks like you.
[3:18:31.640 --> 3:18:32.640]  They get on the internet.
[3:18:32.640 --> 3:18:35.640]  You know, they search themselves because they're troop seekers.
[3:18:35.640 --> 3:18:37.640]  And that's what we have to have.
[3:18:37.640 --> 3:18:39.640]  And by the way, that's true.
[3:18:39.640 --> 3:18:42.640]  Free Republic is one of the biggest websites in the world.
[3:18:42.640 --> 3:18:44.640]  Now we're bigger than they are.
[3:18:44.640 --> 3:18:50.640]  They've just no one goes to them because it's literally low grade morons saying open borders,
[3:18:50.640 --> 3:18:53.640]  New World Order, North American Union are good.
[3:18:53.640 --> 3:18:54.640]  And so they're gone.
[3:18:54.640 --> 3:19:00.640]  I mean, the other big sites are shadows of what they were because they had to sell out to the neocons.
[3:19:00.640 --> 3:19:02.640]  Well, we've got to keep going.
[3:19:02.640 --> 3:19:04.640]  We've got to get more information out.
[3:19:04.640 --> 3:19:07.640]  We have to get more, you know, converts, Alex.
[3:19:07.640 --> 3:19:09.640]  And that's what we're trying to do here.
[3:19:09.640 --> 3:19:13.640]  And I will keep speaking out no matter what.
[3:19:13.640 --> 3:19:14.640]  Well, you're wonderful.
[3:19:14.640 --> 3:19:15.640]  What else?
[3:19:15.640 --> 3:19:17.640]  We're about to go to break when we come back.
[3:19:17.640 --> 3:19:21.640]  I want to hear from Karen Johnson about whatever is on her mind, where she thinks this country is going.
[3:19:21.640 --> 3:19:27.640]  If you're positive about the future or negative, and then we're going to take calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[3:19:27.640 --> 3:19:31.640]  We've got her for another, well, 40 minutes to be exact.
[3:19:31.640 --> 3:19:33.640]  1-800-259-9231.
[3:19:33.640 --> 3:19:36.640]  Pretty much any issues game, but 9-11's encouraged.
[3:19:36.640 --> 3:19:42.640]  Don't forget big stories up on infowars.com and prisonbunna.com with the breaking Jesse Ventura story.

[3:22:45.640 --> 3:22:50.640]  These radios around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[3:22:50.640 --> 3:22:56.640]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet and lack of exercise.
[3:22:56.640 --> 3:23:01.640]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease.
[3:23:01.640 --> 3:23:07.640]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and loss of weight.
[3:23:07.640 --> 3:23:13.640]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[3:23:13.640 --> 3:23:17.640]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[3:23:17.640 --> 3:23:22.640]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[3:23:22.640 --> 3:23:25.640]  Do your part, alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[3:23:25.640 --> 3:23:35.640]  Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[3:24:10.640 --> 3:24:13.640]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen. I need your help.
[3:24:13.640 --> 3:24:19.640]  Jesse Ventura saying in 9-11 the government was probably behind it, not just that it looks like an inside job.
[3:24:19.640 --> 3:24:24.640]  Now he's saying who did the job, that it's insurance fraud is part of it.
[3:24:24.640 --> 3:24:28.640]  This is huge. It's up on prismplanet.com right now.
[3:24:28.640 --> 3:24:33.640]  We need your help getting the story out to everybody and all the developments that happened when he was on with us yesterday.
[3:24:33.640 --> 3:24:37.640]  Talking to State Senator Karen Johnson, what do you think is most important today in our world?
[3:24:37.640 --> 3:24:41.640]  What do you see happening in our future? Are you optimistic or what?
[3:24:41.640 --> 3:24:46.640]  Oh, Alex, I wish I could be more optimistic.
[3:24:46.640 --> 3:24:58.640]  The more that I learn and the more that I read, I have to admit that it's pretty frustrating, but I just thank God that we have people like yourself out there
[3:24:58.640 --> 3:25:07.640]  and many other great organizations that are trying to alert the people to the peril that we are in because we are losing our country.
[3:25:07.640 --> 3:25:17.640]  Well, perhaps it's pretty far gone, but there are things that we can do and the more people that we wake up and that we help become alert to what's happening around them,
[3:25:17.640 --> 3:25:24.640]  you know, the better chance we'll have of saving our country.
[3:25:24.640 --> 3:25:29.640]  What do you see happening on the horizon with the dollar plunging, our name destroyed?
[3:25:29.640 --> 3:25:33.640]  All three presidential candidates are the worst I've ever seen.
[3:25:33.640 --> 3:25:36.640]  Oh, I couldn't agree more about that.
[3:25:36.640 --> 3:25:42.640]  I, you know, I was very disappointed and yet I'm not sure if it was the American people.
[3:25:42.640 --> 3:25:51.640]  When we had a candidate like Ron Paul, a really probably the best candidate we've had in decades that's ever, well, perhaps ever,
[3:25:51.640 --> 3:25:58.640]  but he's out there, he's expressing his thoughts and views which are strictly and totally constitutional,
[3:25:58.640 --> 3:26:09.640]  and yet, you know, he gets 8, 10, maybe 15% out in the voting, but I'm not sure that the voting is being counted right.
[3:26:09.640 --> 3:26:17.640]  I'm thinking that we may be past having, you know, really accurate voting, Alex.
[3:26:17.640 --> 3:26:24.640]  Well, what else does the federal government not cheat in and we've, I mean, these voting machine companies have all been caught red handed.
[3:26:24.640 --> 3:26:26.640]  Yeah, it's pretty sad.
[3:26:26.640 --> 3:26:31.640]  Last year, oh my gosh, I ran a bill here in the Arizona state legislature.
[3:26:31.640 --> 3:26:33.640]  It actually died at least nine times.
[3:26:33.640 --> 3:26:42.640]  I don't know how we ever got it through and it was an absolute miracle that our Democrat governor signed it and it was such a really small thing.
[3:26:42.640 --> 3:26:54.640]  We simply require a 2% hand count, you know, at the end of the day on random sample precincts so that nobody knows ahead of time which ones are going to be counted,
[3:26:54.640 --> 3:27:00.640]  you know, and then we get into the computer diff that's in the diables and the sequoias.
[3:27:00.640 --> 3:27:06.640]  And anyway, it was such a little thing, but wow, did we have a lot of opposition to that.
[3:27:06.640 --> 3:27:09.640]  It was very difficult to even get that through.
[3:27:09.640 --> 3:27:12.640]  Well, it's simple and it's what the founding fathers told us.
[3:27:12.640 --> 3:27:14.640]  There's a lot of money involved in government.
[3:27:14.640 --> 3:27:18.640]  They always take over societies of their left to their own devices.
[3:27:18.640 --> 3:27:21.640]  They're always destructive and abusive.
[3:27:21.640 --> 3:27:28.640]  There are powerful, intelligent interests that want to use the mechanism of government to enslave and control.
[3:27:28.640 --> 3:27:34.640]  Yeah, it's not an if, it's a guarantee that that's going to happen and it's now happened again.
[3:27:34.640 --> 3:27:35.640]  Senator.
[3:27:35.640 --> 3:27:37.640]  Yeah, no, I couldn't agree more.
[3:27:37.640 --> 3:27:45.640]  One of the things that was so disturbing here in Arizona is that our governor, Democrat Janet Napolitano,
[3:27:45.640 --> 3:27:52.640]  signed on this last fall with of all people, you know, Republican Homeland Security Director Chertoff,
[3:27:52.640 --> 3:27:58.640]  to put Arizona into this pilot program for the National ID.
[3:27:58.640 --> 3:28:06.640]  Not only will that cost the state some money if, in fact, it were implemented and we are in, die, we're over a $2 billion deficit.
[3:28:06.640 --> 3:28:14.640]  But we did run a bill this year to opt us out of the real ID to say that Arizona's not going to have anything to do with it.
[3:28:14.640 --> 3:28:21.640]  And I was so proud of the governor from Montana, you know, who just told Mr. Chertoff where to go, where the sun doesn't shine.
[3:28:21.640 --> 3:28:29.640]  And hopefully he will contact our governor and say, sign this bill because it has passed both the House and the Senate.
[3:28:29.640 --> 3:28:32.640]  And we're waiting to see whether or not she's going to sign it.
[3:28:32.640 --> 3:28:38.640]  Well, the incredible thing is they give all the illegals passes, they accept bank cards that the banks give them with no ID,
[3:28:38.640 --> 3:28:43.640]  and then they tell the public, oh, it's to stop the illegals when the government gives them a free pass.
[3:28:43.640 --> 3:28:52.640]  Under the NAU, the fence is basically going to be used to keep us in, and then the illegals will just be legal to go and come as they will.
[3:28:52.640 --> 3:28:58.640]  So it's, you know, they're selling it to some conservatives as something to, quote, stop illegal immigration.
[3:28:58.640 --> 3:29:01.640]  They could do that overnight by prosecuting employers.
[3:29:01.640 --> 3:29:08.640]  Yeah, they absolutely have really diluted some of the conservatives with that particular issue.
[3:29:08.640 --> 3:29:12.640]  And it's been a real hard sell sometimes to turn them around.
[3:29:12.640 --> 3:29:15.640]  I've been appreciative of all entities.
[3:29:15.640 --> 3:29:22.640]  The ACLU has been extremely helpful in pushing this particular issue as well as helping me with one other issue.
[3:29:22.640 --> 3:29:26.640]  And that was that we're not going to fingerprint our kids in school.
[3:29:26.640 --> 3:29:27.640]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:29:27.640 --> 3:29:34.640]  I want to hear about that when we get back in your phone calls, State Senator Karen Johnson, an amazing lady, speaking up for 9-Eleven Truth.
[3:29:34.640 --> 3:29:35.640]  Stay with us.
[3:29:35.640 --> 3:29:39.640]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:39.640 --> 3:29:42.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:46.640 --> 3:29:52.640]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[3:29:52.640 --> 3:29:58.640]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high stress lifestyles.
[3:29:58.640 --> 3:30:02.640]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[3:30:02.640 --> 3:30:07.640]  The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[3:30:07.640 --> 3:30:16.640]  At SnyderHealth.com, we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[3:30:26.640 --> 3:30:31.640]  Now you can easily and effectively read your body of harmful acidic waste with alkaline ionized water.
[3:30:31.640 --> 3:30:36.640]  Let SnyderHealth.com provide the water ionizer that's right for you and your family.

[3:30:44.640 --> 3:30:49.640]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[3:30:49.640 --> 3:30:54.640]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:30:54.640 --> 3:30:59.640]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[3:30:59.640 --> 3:31:10.640]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:31:10.640 --> 3:31:18.640]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:31:18.640 --> 3:31:22.640]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:31:22.640 --> 3:31:25.640]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:31:25.640 --> 3:31:30.640]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their after-missing.

[3:31:44.640 --> 3:31:50.640]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[3:31:50.640 --> 3:31:55.640]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American Empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[3:31:55.640 --> 3:32:01.640]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading The Nationalist Times each month.

[3:37:02.640 --> 3:37:08.240]  Everybody's got to be doing that. So that's great information. Yeah, that makes you not dependent on big brother
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:15.020]  Did you see the New York Times article where it said 44% national increase in local tattletale lines?
[3:37:15.020 --> 3:37:18.200]  They're tattling to get money to pay the rent or to get gas
[3:37:20.400 --> 3:37:22.400]  That's all that what you think of it
[3:37:23.240 --> 3:37:28.120]  I'm just going holy cow. What is going on now? It's just getting crazier and crazier
[3:37:28.120 --> 3:37:32.600]  Grandmothers turning their grandchildren in for 500 bucks for marijuana
[3:37:33.360 --> 3:37:35.480]  Me well, we know who ships in the rail drugs
[3:37:35.960 --> 3:37:37.960]  Yeah, yeah, just
[3:37:38.960 --> 3:37:42.400]  Absolutely incredible and well me my point is is that that's what they do
[3:37:42.400 --> 3:37:45.800]  They'll shut the food off and say turn your neighbor in for guns and you get food
[3:37:46.320 --> 3:37:53.580]  Yeah, yeah, and and people are going to be in such dire straits because they haven't planned and they haven't prepared
[3:37:53.580 --> 3:37:58.260]  And they're so ignorant that it's going to be pretty pretty devastating
[3:37:58.700 --> 3:38:00.380]  Well, it certainly is
[3:38:00.380 --> 3:38:03.700]  So I didn't even know about that so they don't tell us about victories
[3:38:03.700 --> 3:38:07.260]  You guys banned at the state level the thumb scanners to get their lunches
[3:38:08.340 --> 3:38:14.540]  Yes, the bill the actual bill that Iran says that it prohibits public schools from collecting biometric
[3:38:15.060 --> 3:38:20.940]  Information from pupils unless the schools receive written parental permission, but we even took that out
[3:38:20.940 --> 3:38:26.660]  I mean, it's just can't be done. Well, you're a you're really a hero and you're a hero
[3:38:27.900 --> 3:38:34.260]  Well, we we got some good support as I said from the ACLU on this so that was kind of interesting
[3:38:34.660 --> 3:38:37.700]  Well, they you see ACLU's got for my experience
[3:38:37.700 --> 3:38:40.420]  I'd like to get your take on it great members and they mean well
[3:38:40.740 --> 3:38:45.260]  But at the top they they create bad case law at the top they're controlled just like the NRA
[3:38:45.380 --> 3:38:48.260]  We've proven in their own internal documents is a gun control group
[3:38:48.260 --> 3:38:53.660]  They they always keep their friends closer enemies closer and so they're there and so yeah
[3:38:53.660 --> 3:38:56.340]  I'm sure you've got a good local chapter and they bear some good fruit
[3:38:56.620 --> 3:38:59.420]  But nothing like Karen Johnson everything you do is good
[3:39:00.060 --> 3:39:04.740]  Well, you know Alex, it's funny because here we had such great support, you know on this
[3:39:04.980 --> 3:39:12.740]  Opting out of the real ID and the the fingerprint, but then let me tell you I ran a bill this year that just about blew up
[3:39:12.740 --> 3:39:18.980]  The house was sent that it was in regards to concealed weapons carrying them on
[3:39:19.740 --> 3:39:24.260]  Your universities and college campuses and the original bill allowed
[3:39:25.300 --> 3:39:32.260]  Anybody to carry on to any campuses even, you know grade schools and junior high and high schools
[3:39:32.420 --> 3:39:38.380]  We're talking about now adults that are valid concealed weapon carry permit holders
[3:39:38.380 --> 3:39:43.740]  We're not talking about kids carrying guns which some people got a little mixed up about but
[3:39:44.340 --> 3:39:50.380]  This thing just blew the lid off of what was going on down here. I mean talk about controversy
[3:39:51.220 --> 3:39:57.340]  Yeah, you send your children to a place where it's been advertised in the national media that psychos are supposed to go
[3:39:57.340 --> 3:40:01.460]  We're always on prozac type drugs prozac class. It's advertised
[3:40:01.540 --> 3:40:05.700]  What do I do when I'm depressed and psycho and get out of some government mind control facility?
[3:40:05.700 --> 3:40:11.020]  I go up and shoot schools up and then we send our children to a place where no one's allowed to protect them
[3:40:11.860 --> 3:40:12.900]  Exactly if you know
[3:40:12.900 --> 3:40:18.220]  I've got this poster in my office that a lot of people got a kick out of because it has a picture of a gun
[3:40:18.220 --> 3:40:23.540]  You know a handgun with the line through it and it says attention criminals gun-free zone
[3:40:23.700 --> 3:40:30.940]  All law-abiding faculty staff and students of this institution have been disarmed for your convenience
[3:40:30.940 --> 3:40:36.300]  Absolutely, we're wonderful. We should all put out posters like that and hang them everywhere now
[3:40:36.300 --> 3:40:39.600]  Look, I said people can disagree this guy calls about once a week and
[3:40:41.620 --> 3:40:45.220]  And I'm not gonna spend a long time with him. He always says the same stuff
[3:40:45.220 --> 3:40:47.660]  It's like pulling a string on one of those dolls
[3:40:48.100 --> 3:40:52.060]  But we'll go to Justin first and we'll go to everybody else Justin in Texas. You're on the air
[3:40:52.060 --> 3:40:58.820]  I was just calling to disagree of course and I just wanted to tell Senator Karen Johnson that maybe the reason
[3:40:58.820 --> 3:41:03.220]  That she's not convinced with the original story of 9-eleven is because she's
[3:41:03.980 --> 3:41:07.420]  Influenced by intellectually bankrupt movies like loose change
[3:41:07.860 --> 3:41:13.660]  Which don't tell the complete facts they quote mine firefighters and it's just completely untrue
[3:41:13.820 --> 3:41:20.340]  Okay, thank you for the call and everything you said disinfo and not true and you're not gonna stop us exposed in government sponsored terror
[3:41:20.540 --> 3:41:22.840]  Let me tell you something these are debunking sites
[3:41:23.460 --> 3:41:25.780]  One of them goes oh my gosh, I'm in the army
[3:41:25.780 --> 3:41:29.300]  I am having to get a chip that tracks me but I I guess they're still cooks
[3:41:29.380 --> 3:41:34.260]  It didn't exist but now it does but I you're a hero to take your chip and that very guy
[3:41:34.260 --> 3:41:38.220]  You just heard or someone claiming to be him went and posted on there and said oh you're a hero
[3:41:38.220 --> 3:41:42.860]  It's good to take chips for your government and and they'll say Northwoods isn't real
[3:41:43.500 --> 3:41:46.020]  They'll say Gulf of Tonkin was a stage
[3:41:46.020 --> 3:41:52.620]  They'll they didn't matter the Chicago Tribune admits the NSA admits that USS Liberty was attacked to be sunk to blame it on
[3:41:52.620 --> 3:41:57.700]  Egypt that Israel did know it was an American ship. They'll just say it's not true
[3:41:58.140 --> 3:42:01.140]  Karen that's what must be pretty easy when you just deny reality
[3:42:01.780 --> 3:42:03.580]  Well, you know
[3:42:03.580 --> 3:42:09.700]  Alex my resources for my feelings on 9-11 come from you know
[3:42:10.260 --> 3:42:14.300]  Richard gauge from the architects and engineers for truth. I think their
[3:42:15.660 --> 3:42:20.580]  Website is AE 9 11 truth and they've now published not just in their own published
[3:42:20.580 --> 3:42:22.580]  Sign of it grips but in prestigious
[3:42:23.980 --> 3:42:31.340]  Publications here reviewed. That's right. It's over for you terrorist. Okay, and then you know
[3:42:31.340 --> 3:42:33.860]  I I personally know dr. Stephen Jones
[3:42:33.860 --> 3:42:40.900]  I've been to three different conferences where we've been able to sit and discuss a lot of this and then David Ray Griffin was here
[3:42:40.900 --> 3:42:45.980]  Not too long ago in Phoenix and had the privilege of listening to him and getting some of his information
[3:42:45.980 --> 3:42:51.420]  I think these people are pretty doggone credible people. They are let's talk to who's up next here
[3:42:53.860 --> 3:42:56.660]  Mari in Arizona you're on the air with Senator Karen Johnson
[3:42:57.620 --> 3:42:59.940]  See Karen Johnson for governor. Yeah
[3:43:01.340 --> 3:43:03.940]  Senator I wanted to ask you do you support?
[3:43:04.900 --> 3:43:09.460]  Submission to federal jurisdiction and destruction of the state sovereignty for Arizona
[3:43:09.460 --> 3:43:17.860]  Do I support states rights? Yeah, she introduced a bill in what 99 when Clinton was getting ready for martial law
[3:43:18.020 --> 3:43:23.220]  To for the state to secede if they confiscated guns or declared a new world order. Why don't you tell them about that?
[3:43:24.460 --> 3:43:27.860]  I'm talking about the English Language Learning Act
[3:43:28.900 --> 3:43:30.900]  federal judge Collins I
[3:43:31.100 --> 3:43:37.500]  Called him up and asked him why he gave an issue an illegal order and he said because the state of Arizona in the year
[3:43:37.500 --> 3:43:39.140]  2000
[3:43:39.140 --> 3:43:44.940]  Submitted to federal jurisdiction and surrendered the state sovereignty and it was Janina Paul governor Janina
[3:43:44.940 --> 3:43:50.660]  Poletano who signed the government contract. Let me just say this that's what Homeland Security is their federal eyes in schools
[3:43:50.820 --> 3:43:56.180]  They're federalizing firemen giving them guns having them spy on you ruining our wonderful firemen
[3:43:56.180 --> 3:44:00.180]  I mean it's just a disease of federal federal scum senator
[3:44:00.180 --> 3:44:07.900]  Well, I can tell you that it's been extremely frustrating and disturbing to me that our legislators here in Arizona
[3:44:07.980 --> 3:44:14.780]  Many of them including our leadership have acquiesced to the federal government time and time again
[3:44:15.060 --> 3:44:19.700]  When when there have been a group of us here in the legislature that have said enough
[3:44:20.060 --> 3:44:27.060]  Stop we need to assert our states rights, but they would not do it and we didn't have enough legislators that would stand with us
[3:44:27.060 --> 3:44:34.220]  You know to go against the courts and the federal government and that's because they want to move up the crime syndicate ladder to the international and federal level
[3:44:36.260 --> 3:44:41.140]  And well, please elaborate then if you'd like to elaborate on that if you agree senator, but the bigger problem here
[3:44:41.580 --> 3:44:49.120]  Is it the Fed's take a dollar of our money on average and give us 33 cents back on average these idiots think that it's free money senator?
[3:44:50.580 --> 3:44:55.660]  We've been trying to get our state to hold on to all of our
[3:44:55.660 --> 3:45:03.860]  Transportation taxes here because we're one of those donor states and we've said hey look let's hold all of our transportation taxes
[3:45:03.860 --> 3:45:07.580]  Let's spend the money on what we need to spend on if there's anything left
[3:45:07.580 --> 3:45:12.540]  Then maybe we'll send it on to the federal government. If not, we need to do what we need to do here with it
[3:45:13.980 --> 3:45:17.100]  Yes, why give them money to hire more shaved head
[3:45:17.700 --> 3:45:19.700]  Guys with devil tats all over them
[3:45:19.700 --> 3:45:27.920]  To be BATF officers while they drive around in bright yellow Corvettes and live in million dollar houses are dealing narcotics
[3:45:28.180 --> 3:45:32.740]  Okay, thank you so much Mari Arthur and mash you're on the air with senator Karen Johnson
[3:45:33.940 --> 3:45:40.220]  Hello, yes, sir. Oh, is this a Alex? Yes, sir. You're on here, sir. I've been a longtime friend
[3:45:40.940 --> 3:45:47.100]  Listen reviewers. We are friends. We're all a family and I have all your videos and I wanted to let you in the senator
[3:45:47.100 --> 3:45:51.980]  No, she mentioned meet-ups. I've been a member of a meet-up that meets in Cambridge on Sundays and
[3:45:53.140 --> 3:45:56.460]  It's it's kind of a strange name. They call it the conspiracy cafe
[3:45:56.460 --> 3:46:02.500]  But it basically deals with 9-eleven truth of the truth about everything, you know, not just 9-eleven and
[3:46:04.140 --> 3:46:09.540]  I'm you know, I'm very very tired. I woke up during the 60s when I was in Vietnam
[3:46:09.540 --> 3:46:14.940]  That's when I became aware of what what what the world's really about. I look behind the curtain and
[3:46:14.940 --> 3:46:22.000]  And what's frustrating is 99 out of a hundred people I talked to you and you try to reason with them about
[3:46:23.180 --> 3:46:24.580]  9-eleven the new world
[3:46:24.580 --> 3:46:29.100]  Oh, this you're gonna love this when I mentioned the New World Order of the Bilderbergers the Rothschild
[3:46:29.700 --> 3:46:35.060]  People look at me like I belong in a mental institution and they'll say that's all urban folklore
[3:46:35.060 --> 3:46:40.060]  Oh, yeah, they say Bilderberg doesn't exist CFR doesn't exist like I mentioned
[3:46:40.060 --> 3:46:46.340]  But that's what let listen you Bilderberg's having its meeting in the US. They used to always I heard that on your show
[3:46:46.340 --> 3:46:51.980]  Yes, they used to normally have it in Europe and they're doing it because we have a more blacked-out media and we have police
[3:46:51.980 --> 3:46:55.100]  That'll that'll go after citizens senator Johnson comments
[3:46:55.620 --> 3:47:02.000]  Well, they need to take have a subscription to American Free Press. I mean my gosh, they expose
[3:47:02.500 --> 3:47:08.300]  You know Michael Collins Piper writes about the Bilderbergers all the time. I mean he does great work
[3:47:08.300 --> 3:47:14.260]  You do great work. There is information all over that is extremely accurate and documented about this group
[3:47:15.300 --> 3:47:18.900]  Absolutely anything else Arthur, you know, you know, it's like the NA you
[3:47:20.020 --> 3:47:21.500]  the Amaro
[3:47:21.500 --> 3:47:27.020]  Everyone I talked to they said, where are you getting your information? I point them, you know to web or I brought up the
[3:47:27.020 --> 3:47:34.100]  The topic of eugenics that that's make-believe. It's not real and then when I point them somewhere on the web
[3:47:34.100 --> 3:47:39.780]  They'll say well the web they'll make believe and it's run by wackos and if you point them at US government documents Library of Congress
[3:47:39.780 --> 3:47:43.140]  They say that doesn't exist actually I've sent some of them to the PNAC site
[3:47:43.140 --> 3:47:46.300]  I see you want to hear it from the horses rear end, you know, go to PNAC
[3:47:46.580 --> 3:47:51.940]  Well, how do we know that's not a real that's not a look they're living in denial and they're gonna be not look
[3:47:51.940 --> 3:47:52.820]  I appreciate your call
[3:47:52.820 --> 3:47:58.180]  I've got people telling me the dollar hasn't been devalued and I'm a liar and then they go on the message boards and say I'm
[3:47:58.180 --> 3:48:01.980]  Al-Qaeda trying to lie to them the government's all I'm not kidding
[3:48:01.980 --> 3:48:08.180]  They say that I'm working for Al-Qaeda. Well, the White House has said that 9-11 truth works for Ahmed energy the senator. Oh
[3:48:09.180 --> 3:48:17.420]  Alex, you know what I do up in answer to this gentleman when I start talking to people if they think I'm out whacked out and cookie
[3:48:17.420 --> 3:48:21.500]  I move on I find people that are open and yeah, I agree
[3:48:21.500 --> 3:48:24.540]  I mean I mean the type of people that don't know we're in big trouble
[3:48:24.540 --> 3:48:28.860]  I mean, I mean if anybody doesn't can't smell the stench of corruption. There's some
[3:48:28.860 --> 3:48:33.500]  Senator go ahead and make your point. I'm sorry. No, no, no, you you made the point and
[3:48:34.340 --> 3:48:40.980]  We going back to the issue of states rights here. We've got another issue. Oh my gosh, Alex
[3:48:40.980 --> 3:48:47.660]  This is one that has just been huge here in Arizona. We have the federal government coming in to our
[3:48:48.620 --> 3:48:51.460]  federal parks here if you would and and
[3:48:51.900 --> 3:48:58.500]  For us like the Tondo National Forest the Sitgraves National Forest that we have up north and we have the Saguaro National Monument
[3:48:58.500 --> 3:49:01.620]  Other areas and they're closing down the roads. They are
[3:49:02.260 --> 3:49:05.420]  Preventing the public from coming in and using these areas
[3:49:05.420 --> 3:49:11.340]  I mean they don't want a human footprint back in a lot of these areas and these lands belong to us
[3:49:11.580 --> 3:49:16.580]  They belong to the people here in the state of Arizona and the people of the United States
[3:49:16.580 --> 3:49:21.940]  And we have run a bill to say stop you are not going to do that anymore in Arizona
[3:49:21.940 --> 3:49:27.500]  We're opening these roads up and they're going to stay so people can get back in there for camping for hiking
[3:49:27.500 --> 3:49:33.220]  They can take their their ATVs. They can do what they want back in there, you know without destroying the environment
[3:49:33.820 --> 3:49:35.820]  but we've got to do this and
[3:49:36.140 --> 3:49:42.140]  For the federal government to come in and just arbitrarily start closing down these roads and locking us out
[3:49:42.140 --> 3:49:47.300]  It's all about power all about control absolute trash Christian Florida. You're on the air go ahead
[3:49:48.500 --> 3:49:51.920]  Hi, Alex. Yeah, I just wanted to applaud the senator
[3:49:52.460 --> 3:49:54.460]  Coming forward and being so open-minded
[3:49:54.460 --> 3:50:01.500]  The second thing I wanted to ask two things. Um, one are there other American legislators that are
[3:50:02.940 --> 3:50:09.940]  Open-minded and also know about this and then two if you just do a minimal amount of study into 9-11
[3:50:09.940 --> 3:50:11.940]  It's so obvious that
[3:50:13.180 --> 3:50:20.460]  Conversely, maybe they they carried these attacks out with it for death out of desperation was it out of did they want to
[3:50:20.460 --> 3:50:26.820]  Give America a bad name. I mean it just seems so yeah, that's all the plan. Well, they got control
[3:50:26.940 --> 3:50:30.140]  Yeah, stay stay there a senator final segment
[3:50:30.140 --> 3:50:32.340]  We're gonna talk to a few final callers
[3:50:32.340 --> 3:50:37.260]  I want to get your take on why they did it no bid contracts hundreds of billions a year and no bid contracts
[3:50:37.700 --> 3:50:42.580]  Grabbing land grabbing oil domestic police state. They did it for Israel did it for a lot of things
[3:50:42.580 --> 3:50:48.020]  It is a big idea a
[3:50:48.700 --> 3:50:51.260]  New-world order in the near future
[3:50:52.020 --> 3:50:54.020]  Earth is dominated by
[3:50:55.100 --> 3:50:57.100]  It's known as the builder bird
[3:50:57.980 --> 3:51:03.540]  But their objective being world domination or thousands of years their dark order group
[3:51:03.940 --> 3:51:08.420]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order their great dream of
[3:51:08.420 --> 3:51:12.260]  Exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand
[3:51:14.300 --> 3:51:19.660]  For the first time in history the elites plan for world government is blown wide open
[3:51:19.740 --> 3:51:23.580]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda
[3:51:23.580 --> 3:51:28.500]  The old very just making great progress for the world. Most people have no idea. They're not after money
[3:51:28.500 --> 3:51:34.300]  They have all the money they need they're after power. That's their after these you order in game on DVD at prisonplanet.com

[3:51:45.140 --> 3:51:46.780]  Wake up Protestant America
[3:51:46.780 --> 3:51:50.860]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state this
[3:51:51.180 --> 3:51:59.820]  Confederation of evangelicals Catholics and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting block their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by
[3:51:59.820 --> 3:52:05.340]  Legislation our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom liberty of conscience
[3:52:05.460 --> 3:52:10.100]  History and the Bible proved to them that these two systems church and state must be kept separate
[3:52:10.100 --> 3:52:13.980]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us
[3:52:13.980 --> 3:52:17.460]  This will change the character not civil enforcement from history
[3:52:17.460 --> 3:52:20.260]  We saw that when church and state united known as papal Rome
[3:52:20.500 --> 3:52:25.620]  Religious intolerance resulted this union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation
[3:52:25.620 --> 3:52:31.180]  America and papal Rome are uniting in this agenda Protestant America awake before it is too late

[3:54:52.940 --> 3:54:56.980]  You know using the celebrity obsessed culture plus. He's a former governor now
[3:54:56.980 --> 3:55:02.620]  He's really gone public on this show yesterday on Stern today to really get this out. Do you think that's important? Oh
[3:55:03.260 --> 3:55:04.620]  My gosh
[3:55:04.620 --> 3:55:10.780]  Absolutely Alex. I you know you kind of ask why you know why these things happened
[3:55:10.780 --> 3:55:16.380]  And I guess that's one of the big questions and why we want to see up an investigation because you know
[3:55:16.380 --> 3:55:21.140]  We need to know who benefited that's what I'm looking at you if you follow the money
[3:55:21.140 --> 3:55:27.620]  We've spent over three trillion dollars now on a war in Iraq that had nothing to do with 9-eleven
[3:55:27.620 --> 3:55:29.620]  That a handful of groups get
[3:55:29.820 --> 3:55:37.900]  Right, right. Oh my gosh a handful of corporations like black water and and Halliburton and Brown and Root and on and on and then
[3:55:37.900 --> 3:55:43.420]  You've got we we've got the Patriot Act. We've got homeland security. We've got now the real ID
[3:55:43.420 --> 3:55:45.420]  We we lost our habeas corpus
[3:55:45.420 --> 3:55:53.140]  Uh, you know, we we've got illegal wiretapping. These are all things that I don't think could have been pushed on the American people
[3:55:53.420 --> 3:55:55.420]  without 9-eleven I
[3:55:56.060 --> 3:55:58.620]  Agree and now the crooks to know that we're on to them
[3:55:58.620 --> 3:56:01.860]  So they already had their police state set up in case we try to remove them
[3:56:01.860 --> 3:56:05.380]  They've got their electronic voting machines going in a perfect storm of evil
[3:56:05.380 --> 3:56:10.300]  But the people are waking up like never before and the globalists themselves say they're scared
[3:56:10.300 --> 3:56:15.500]  So now was the time for courage to speak up not to cower. Some people are on the air saying be quiet
[3:56:15.500 --> 3:56:21.220]  Don't tell anyone you're against the rule order. They'll get you know if we cower then they win senator comments on that
[3:56:21.820 --> 3:56:25.420]  Well, you're absolutely right and I oh Alex
[3:56:25.420 --> 3:56:31.780]  I appreciate you so much and what you are doing and have been doing for a long time now and for others that are willing to
[3:56:31.780 --> 3:56:35.380]  Stand up and to speak out. I mean we've got to do it
[3:56:35.380 --> 3:56:40.980]  Well, you were awake a long time before I was but you said that one of the reasons you passed that law against the whole
[3:56:40.980 --> 3:56:45.860]  New World Order deal in your state or tried to about getting the UN out was because you saw some of my films and
[3:56:45.980 --> 3:56:51.020]  And you know, then you help wake up other people. I wake up people you woke up folks. It probably woke me up
[3:56:51.020 --> 3:56:55.220]  I mean, it's all symbiotic and and and when we're together on this
[3:56:55.220 --> 3:57:00.940]  So I don't want any of the listeners to think that they're talking to their neighbors and friends doesn't have an effect. Oh
[3:57:00.940 --> 3:57:07.180]  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. We are put setting up little groups and it's just like here in Arizona
[3:57:07.260 --> 3:57:10.140]  You know, we have these meetup groups and you know
[3:57:10.140 --> 3:57:12.380]  And if people want to help with this 9-eleven issue
[3:57:12.500 --> 3:57:17.420]  They can donate money to this cause if they can't get out and participate more, you know
[3:57:17.420 --> 3:57:22.740]  On a personal level and I want to be clear folks if we don't expose government sponsored tear and turn it back now
[3:57:22.860 --> 3:57:27.540]  They're going all the way. They're sitting just going to be some banana republic tyranny. This is a scientific one
[3:57:27.540 --> 3:57:33.100]  These are very cold-blooded people senator Johnson. I want to thank you for all the time you spent with us
[3:57:33.100 --> 3:57:35.380]  Do you want to fire out your senatorial website?
[3:57:37.140 --> 3:57:39.140]  Gee, I don't even know what it is
[3:57:39.580 --> 3:57:44.100]  You missed I've Karen Johnson into Google. Oh, yeah, the website is just a z
[3:57:45.140 --> 3:57:47.740]  leg.gov anything else you want to plug
[3:57:49.340 --> 3:57:55.980]  No, just I want people to get involved and I want them to belong to these meetup groups and you know go into
[3:57:55.980 --> 3:58:02.060]  Send some money to the architects and engineers at nine eleven truth calm
[3:58:02.060 --> 3:58:06.380]  I mean they need money to continue the the push to get an independent investigation
