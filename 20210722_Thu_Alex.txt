[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Don't bother, they're here.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  Isn't it rich?
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  Isn't it queer?
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  Losing my timing this late in my career.
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  And I've heard you speak about it because you're always straight up about what you're doing.
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are,
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  why can't the experts say,
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.000]  we know that this virus is in fact,
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.000]  it's going to be, or excuse me,
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  That's underway too, I expect that to occur quickly.
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.000]  Well that means you mean for the FDA?
[01:19.000 --> 01:20.000]  For the FDA.
[01:20.000 --> 01:29.000]  Some of the stuff, I mean QAnon, the idea that the Democrats or the Biden is hiding people
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  and sucking the blood of children.
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  No, I'm serious, that's...
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  Now you may not like me and that's your right.
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  Look, it's a simple thing, you can walk out and say,
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.000]  I just don't like the way that guy wears his tie.
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.000]  I'm voting against him, you have a right to do that.
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  And in the clouds...
[01:54.000 --> 02:01.000]  I think I'm beginning to see some of the, and both, and by Democrats as well.
[02:01.000 --> 02:08.000]  Sort of the venom gets sort of sort of leaked out of a lot.
[02:08.000 --> 02:16.000]  Welcome my friends on this live Thursday, July 22nd broadcast.
[02:16.000 --> 02:23.000]  You can't really overstate the fiasco, the train wreck that was last night.
[02:23.000 --> 02:25.000]  I did not watch it live.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  I went out into business meeting late dinner with some of the crew,
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  with Owen Shroyer and Rob Do and again some of the crew.
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  And then I got home and it was just all over the place, what a disaster it was.
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.000]  So I watched the whole thing and it was an hour and a half, I'll never get back in my life.
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.000]  It was absolutely horrible and I didn't feel good like, oh, here's my enemy, here's the puppet, he can't talk.
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  He has complete dementia.
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  My grandmother in 92 was purposely not eating anymore because she wanted to die.
[02:57.000 --> 03:06.000]  She weighed about 90 pounds and she was way more coherent the day she died of self-imposed starvation.
[03:06.000 --> 03:09.000]  I'm not blaming her, that's the Christian way to go if you want to go.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  She refused morphine, refused at all, didn't eat, refused cancer surgery, cancer was eating her up.
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  They had already done cancer surgery years before so she said she wouldn't do it anymore.
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  But I'm digressing.
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.000]  My 92-year-old grandmother eating alive by cancer, starving herself to death,
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  as she was dying, was more coherent than he is on stage.
[03:31.000 --> 03:34.000]  She was going in and out, I wasn't there, but family was.
[03:34.000 --> 03:41.000]  Like, oh, I see my husband, I see the angels, oh, my mother, my father, I see you, I love you, I'll be there soon.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  She was coherent while she was dying.
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  They had this person up there, less coherent than my grandmother when she died,
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  or my grandfather when he died, my dad's dad was very coherent when he was dying.
[03:53.000 --> 04:02.000]  People dying are more coherent than this individual and that's because he's a tombstone.
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  He's a sign that they've dominated us and they're going to rub this into our faces.
[04:06.000 --> 04:15.000]  I have articles here all over the country, they're putting men in prisons and letting them rape women,
[04:15.000 --> 04:21.000]  in women's prisons, and then tell them the women just have an abortion or make them more condoms.
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.000]  Because, you know, a woman's allowed to rape when women have penises.
[04:26.000 --> 04:38.000]  And we have a reanimated corpse up there on TV that is just a sign of how pathetic we are.
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.000]  And I'm being honest, we're not going to climb out of this until we admit what a joke we are.
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  This is disgusting, this is untenable, we're being gas-lit to death and it needs to stop.
[04:48.000 --> 04:55.000]  I mean, the entire town hall was the biggest train wreck I've ever seen and it's just going to get worse.
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.000]  I mean, my God, they did this on purpose.
[05:26.000 --> 05:33.000]  Organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.

[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.

[06:26.000 --> 06:33.000]  Trust me, honey, everything's gonna be all right.
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.000]  Just do like I do, there ain't nothing to it.
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.000]  Listen to me, baby, anybody can do it.
[06:42.000 --> 06:47.000]  All you gotta do is just let yourself go.
[06:47.000 --> 06:55.000]  Welcome, my friends, to this July 22nd, Thursday edition.
[06:55.000 --> 07:01.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  Yeah, let me relax and take it real slow.
[07:03.000 --> 07:10.000]  Let me do this. Let me just read you some of the headlines out of the 200 or so articles and the 100 or so video clips I've got here in front of me.
[07:10.000 --> 07:16.000]  Let me just do that for you and then I'll go through as much of it as I can.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  Let me just go right over here.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  This is the Washington Post yesterday.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  We are testing too many vaccinated people who lack COVID symptoms.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  And they're saying the PCR test is 90 plus percent false positive.
[07:30.000 --> 07:40.000]  And so they should just stop testing the people that have had the vaccine and only make those of us that haven't take the test so they can then restrict us, which they admits a fraud.
[07:40.000 --> 07:51.000]  They admit criminal evil activity. That's just one article. Oh, and they admit Trump was right the whole time when Trump wants you to believe coronavirus cases are up because they test.
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  He's wrong. Really? That was October of last year.
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  That headline aged quite well, didn't it?
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  Trump said more COVID-19 testing creates more cases.
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  Gee, we did the math and he's wrong, says the news.
[08:05.000 --> 08:09.000]  No, so that's a big story right there, huh?
[08:09.000 --> 08:13.000]  Get it? You're going to be tested because you haven't been injected with the poison.
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  They're going to say you're positive the contact traces are going to take you away.
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  By the way, that was announced on Austin News last night.
[08:23.000 --> 08:26.000]  I got home last night after a business dinner.
[08:26.000 --> 08:35.000]  The first thing I saw was oh, it's a fiasco with the town hall that it ended with Biden as he publicly basically dies on stage.
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.000]  That's all that on purpose is to rub it into our faces. This is a sick joke for the globalist and moralizes.
[08:41.000 --> 08:50.000]  Before I did that, I looked at this KXAN news piece that sounds like something like a 1980s movie like Running Man and a Future dystopic thing.
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  It's like we're coming with the contact tracers to take you out of your house. Please comply with the contact tracers.
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.000]  And then the contact tracers we've got in Texas are controlled by Google and the Clinton Foundation.
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  Just can't make that up. That's a headline.
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  Austin Public Health gets tested for COVID-19.
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  Comply with contact tracers to help stop the spread. It's not the illness now.
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  It's the spread that a fake computer says you have.
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.000]  That's just one article on a whole stack.
[09:25.000 --> 09:33.000]  We've got in other news massive looting going on all over the country in Democrat cities who passed laws allowing looting.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  Watch California shoplifter stroll out of TJ Maxx with arms full of merchandise.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  One of them looks like Santa Claus with a huge bag over their back.
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.000]  Eric Clapton says he won't play shows where proof of vaccine is required. That's how you push back.
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  That's just some of the news.
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  Let me plow through some more of the COVID takeover news because that's everything.
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  This is a video Senator Ron Johnson unloads on Fauci.
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  We're going to play this next segment.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  He's culpable. He's lying. He needs to be held accountable.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  And Johnson's one of the best guys we got up there.
[10:04.000 --> 10:12.000]  He goes, this is the big media, the big corporations doing this to take our rights, suppressing treatments, suppressing news, using fake testing.
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  This is a criminal takeover. Yes, where this is 21st century war.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  This is the modern warfare attack.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  Let's wake up to that and let's understand that.
[10:23.000 --> 10:30.000]  Austin Public Health get tested for COVID-19 comply with contact tracers to help stop the spread.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  And that ties in to the next story.
[10:33.000 --> 10:41.000]  Biden administration considering urging vaccinated people to start wearing face masks again as delta variant spreads and vaccine rollout stalls.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  You see, you must always take the shots to leave your house.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  There will always be new variants.
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  You must always take new shots to leave your house.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  And then you still can't leave your house as they get ready to announce new lockdowns.
[10:52.000 --> 11:00.000]  Biden gets ready for mask mandates for children under 12 because they know they're not going to end up approving it under 12.
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  There's just some little speck of humanity left.
[11:03.000 --> 11:09.000]  And so, oh, we're just going to muzzle them and with two masks and teach them that they're slaves.
[11:09.000 --> 11:16.000]  Meanwhile, Democrat who features in infamous massless flight pick calls for universal mask wearing.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  Of course they do.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  And it's all over the world.
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  English care homes could lose 70,000 staff over mandatory COVID jab.
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.000]  It's all fraudulent and huge developments on that front.
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  Shock.
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  Doctor warns the majority of vaccinated patients could have permanent heart damage.
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  Some may die within three years.
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  That's what the studies show.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  Very powerful.
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  List of UK venues that could mandate vaccine passports already expanding.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  Oh, don't worry.
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  It's only a few places.
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  Oh, now it's the grocery store.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  That'll come here as well.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  That's majority of Cape Cod COVID clusters were vaccinated.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  That whole stack of all the world.
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  It's the vaccinated that are mainly dying and mainly getting sick with the actual numbers.
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.000]  But don't worry.
[12:03.000 --> 12:12.000]  Fauci is all over the news saying 99% of the new cases and the deaths are the unvaccinated lying to you.
[12:12.000 --> 12:18.000]  And each one of these is a inch and a half stack of articles we're going to be getting to.
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.000]  More on Ron Paul's double down saying Rand Paul is double down saying that he wants criminal charges against Fauci.
[12:26.000 --> 12:33.000]  Fauci's clearly been caught lying about funding gain of function caught as red handed as anyone ever was.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  That ties into communist China really getting upset.
[12:36.000 --> 12:45.000]  They don't want investigation of Wuhan but then starting to threaten that, hey, we had an agreement with Fort Dietrich and Obama to transfer these viruses to us.
[12:45.000 --> 12:51.000]  So when they say, hey, the Pentagon's involved, that's true under Obama.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  Trump was not involved in this by just defending Trump.
[12:54.000 --> 12:55.000]  It's a fact.
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.000]  2017 he killed these programs to the outrage of the New World Order.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  But China's like, hey, if you're going to bust us, we're going to bust you.
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  We're really getting to that critical point where it's very pregnant right now, nine months pregnant.
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  They're not going to be able to keep the truth from being born.
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  So very explosive point to be at.
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.000]  Right now we're going to be talking about all of that.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  Obviously we're talking about the.
[13:23.000 --> 13:36.000]  Designed Cyop to demoralize us of having Biden continually for an hour and a half or however long it lasted, it seemed like 10 hours long of the town hall last night.
[13:36.000 --> 13:46.000]  Self-destructing melting down actual dementia on stage, not knowing where he was completely full of horse crap.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  Again, I've had family members die in front of me that were more cogent than this.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  I mean, this was this.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  They're all laughing at him, too.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  And by the way, they mainly only had Democrat party staff, they admit now.
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  And they also had people that work for the network that hosted the town hall.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  They're in attendance, but they were laughing at Joe Biden.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  I mean, because it's all about laughing in America.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  That's coming up.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  And I've only scratched the surface of what we're going to be breaking down.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  There's also an excellent article at zero hedge.
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  Klaus Schwab, the humanist versus Klaus Schwab, the terrorist.
[14:28.000 --> 14:35.000]  And that's really what they are as environmental terrorists who claim they're doing all this to bring down human society to save the earth from us.
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  But really they're transhumanist playing God.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  That is all coming up as well.
[14:41.000 --> 14:52.000]  And we've got Biden regime promotes racial justice guide, pushing students and teachers to quote disrupt whiteness and remove whiteness from America.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  Sounds a lot like genocide.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  So that's all going to be broken down.
[14:58.000 --> 15:07.000]  But the first thing I want to hit is big tech and the big media working in this combine.
[15:07.000 --> 15:16.000]  And it ties into the short little piece we're going to play of Senator Ron Johnson talking about the culpability of Fauci and others.
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000]  How big tech isn't just censoring, they're murdering people.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  They're murdering your ability to get medical care.
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  They're murdering your ability to get the truth.
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  They're murdering your ability to get treatments that are basically 100% effective and they are murdering our republic.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  And they are criminals.
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  They are terrorists.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  They are terrorists.
[15:37.000 --> 15:47.000]  They are now banning mainline news sites that point out vaccine injection, experimental injection of children without protocols since illegal.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  YouTube is now banning that.
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  I mean, they are raping us.
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.000]  They are suppressing us while this depopulation sterilization operations carried out.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  They are terrorists.
[15:59.000 --> 16:10.000]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on and that its criminals are extremely pathological.
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.000]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[16:19.000 --> 16:32.000]  Well, guess what? It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenice's globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV.
[16:32.000 --> 16:41.000]  And they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[16:41.000 --> 16:47.000]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[16:47.000 --> 16:56.000]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[16:56.000 --> 17:17.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:26.000 --> 17:52.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:52.000 --> 18:21.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.000]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[18:26.000 --> 18:32.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  All right, finally, finally, Congress gets the big picture.
[18:36.000 --> 18:55.000]  It's a premeditated, launched multinational globalist, UN, big tech, Fortune 100, Chi-Com Alliance, New World Ordered Attack on the Western world, on the middle class, on small businesses, on ranchers, on farmers, on what's left of the Western world.
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.000]  This is a consolidation of power.
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  China's doubled its power, doubled its profits the last year.
[18:59.000 --> 19:07.000]  Some of all the big techs, some of all the big banks, they are assaulting us viciously, preparing another forced worldwide lockdown.
[19:07.000 --> 19:08.000]  And look at this.
[19:08.000 --> 19:17.000]  YouTube deletes family research council video about vaccinating minors against parental consent so they can cover up the criminal activity going on.
[19:17.000 --> 19:26.000]  YouTube deletes 15 videos from Brazilian President Bolsonaro channel for COVID, quote, misinformation, which, again, says it came out of the lab and says Hydroxychloroquine helps you.
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  They want to suppress you. They want to terrorize you. They want to literally rape you.
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  And so that's what we're going to be raking down.
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.000]  But first, I want to point this out.
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.000]  This video on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram had millions and millions of views, different versions.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  They've been pulling it down, calling it vaccine disinfo.
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  So vaccine disinfo from a time machine three years ago.
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  I'm going to play this clip next segment.
[19:49.000 --> 19:53.000]  Watch Alex Jones predict a lockdown from manufactured virus pandemic in 2018.
[19:53.000 --> 19:57.000]  They're not banning it because it's false. They're banning it because it's true.
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.000]  So now if somebody wrote a book 100 years ago about a stage pandemic, would you ban it?
[20:01.000 --> 20:05.000]  Viva Vendetta is about that.
[20:05.000 --> 20:08.000]  You're going to ban Viva Vendetta now? This is how controlled they are.
[20:08.000 --> 20:13.000]  Here's part of Senator Johnson knocking it out of the park on Fox News.
[20:13.000 --> 20:18.000]  Blying here, Senator, it is you.
[20:18.000 --> 20:25.000]  Wow. Senator Rand Paul says that now fashion will be the subject of a criminal referral in a new letter to the Department of Justice.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  Trotomy right now with more on this is Wisconsin Senator,
[20:28.000 --> 20:33.000]  member of the Senate Homeland Security, Foreign Relations, Budget Committees, Ron Johnson.
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.000]  Senator, it's wonderful to see you again. Thanks very much for being here.
[20:37.000 --> 20:41.000]  Way in on what you just heard in terms of gain of function research.
[20:41.000 --> 20:45.000]  Was it taking place in the Wuhan lab of virology?
[20:45.000 --> 20:51.000]  Good morning, Maria. And of course, Dr. Fauci funded gain of function research.
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.000]  He can deny it all he wants. He can have his staff, who are beholden to him for their jobs,
[20:56.000 --> 21:03.000]  claim that somehow what is clearly gain of function research isn't gain of function research, but it was.
[21:03.000 --> 21:08.000]  He's culpable. He's lying about it. And he needs to be held accountable for it.
[21:08.000 --> 21:15.000]  We've written letters to Francis Collins, I guess his ultimate boss, the director of NIH.
[21:15.000 --> 21:20.000]  We're getting no response whatsoever. So the federal government, these federal health agencies,
[21:20.000 --> 21:27.000]  agencies have to become transparent. And I, for one, really appreciate what Senator Paul did in that hearing to expose
[21:27.000 --> 21:33.000]  really his equivocation on this, his lying about what he did and didn't fund,
[21:33.000 --> 21:41.000]  and his potential role in the development of a chimeric coronavirus that is now infecting the world.
[21:41.000 --> 21:47.000]  So you're calling for accountability. What do you want to see happen to Anthony Fauci?
[21:47.000 --> 21:52.000]  And also, I mean, look, they're not being transparent. You're calling for transparency.
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  They're not being transparent. And social media and much of the media is going along with it,
[21:56.000 --> 22:01.000]  censoring all of this information, leaving the American people in the dark.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  Well, first of all, the evidence that this has been hiding in plain sight for months,
[22:05.000 --> 22:10.000]  actually probably for years. All people really had to do is take a look at it.
[22:10.000 --> 22:16.000]  And that's what is so disingenuous about Dr. Fauci right now trying to disclaim any involvement
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  in gain of function research. And quite honestly, I think it's pretty obvious, too,
[22:20.000 --> 22:26.000]  that this coronavirus was not naturally occurring. It was man-made. It's a chimeric virus.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.000]  Again, that has been obvious for months. So the American people deserve the truth.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  Really, the people of the world deserve the truth on this.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  And unfortunately, because of the cabal between social media, mainstream media,
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  and our federal health agencies and big government, we're not getting the truth.
[22:43.000 --> 22:48.000]  The truth has been covered up for months, whether we're talking about gain of function research,
[22:48.000 --> 22:51.000]  whether we're talking about the effectiveness of early treatment.
[22:51.000 --> 22:56.000]  I can't explain all this, Maria. All I know is something has gone off the rails here,
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  and I'm trying to look for answers. It just doesn't make sense to me.
[23:00.000 --> 23:06.000]  Well, it's interesting because the other day, Jen Psaki pretty much admitted that,
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  said, oh, yes, we in the administration are in very close contact with social media
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  to pretty much censor information that they didn't want out there.
[23:16.000 --> 23:21.000]  Will there be accountability on big tech?
[23:21.000 --> 23:26.000]  That's really up to the public to hold them accountable, to start switching their alliance
[23:26.000 --> 23:31.000]  from these platforms to other platforms that actually allow free speech,
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  that won't cooperate and collaborate and collude with big government.
[23:35.000 --> 23:40.000]  Social media has become big brother. It's the big brother arm of big government,
[23:40.000 --> 23:46.000]  and it's your concern and frighten every American.
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  Let me know what you're going to do about it.
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  I mean, the Republicans talk about this.
[23:50.000 --> 23:57.000]  Is there any way you can actually do something about it to bring these companies down to size?
[23:57.000 --> 24:02.000]  We know that there's this fake fight going on between President Biden and Facebook,
[24:02.000 --> 24:05.000]  which I'm not buying because they're working together.
[24:05.000 --> 24:12.000]  What are your thoughts in terms of Section 230 or legislatively changing the prospects
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  for these companies that have become incredibly dominant?
[24:16.000 --> 24:19.000]  Well, because the media is colluding with the Democrat Party,
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  favors the Democrats, the legislative, we're probably not going to be able to do a whole lot about this,
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  not in the near future.
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  What we need to do is we need to expose the truth.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  It's one of the reasons I held an event where I just allowed five women and a 13-year-old girl
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  tell this story about possible vaccine injuries.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  And, of course, you know how that went over,
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.000]  instead of showing any, even an ounce of sympathy for these people to at least have acknowledged
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.000]  that it might be a vaccine so you get to the root cause and develop effective treatments.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  Instead, news media attacked me for allowing them to tell their stories.
[24:51.000 --> 24:59.000]  I just received this morning data out of Israel that shows the population is about 84% vaccinated,
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  but the new cases of COVID in Israel are about 84% with vaccinated individuals.
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.000]  It's certainly looking like the Pfizer vaccine is not working against the Delta variant.
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  Now, that's not being talked about here in the U.S. media.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  Ron Johnson's a great guy.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  I'd love to be president, but he's also a very good person, so he has blind spots.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  I guess he doesn't have a wicked streak down his back like I do, so I see all these enemies' operations.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  Like I said, I'm in Satan's brain.
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  And I think you're in Satan's brain as well because God's given you discernment.
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.000]  We said over a year and a half ago they're going to say new variants are the reason the vaccine doesn't work.
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  You can't have a vaccine for a cold virus.
[25:38.000 --> 25:42.000]  There's thousands of different types every year.
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  And Gates's own documents said they'll be yearly boosters.
[25:45.000 --> 25:46.000]  They knew that.
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000]  It's a fraud.
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  It gets rid of your immune system.
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  And Johnson's like, can't I have a Senate hearing with families?
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  Why does Google censor it? Why does Twitter censor it?
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  Because they're all going to go to prison if it comes out.
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  They're all invested in Big Tech.
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  Big Tech is heavily invested in Big Pharma.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  And you have the warnings on the shots they can give you heart attacks and strokes and Guillain Barre.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  But, see, the senator's still at the point of, oh, can't we just have a hearing to see if it's hurting somebody?
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  Why don't you have a hearing of pouring a gallon of gasoline on yourself and lighting it hurts?
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  Or maybe he catches fire.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  We don't need a hearing about it.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  We know damn well what's going on.
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  We need hearings about how we need to take back the FBI and the federal government
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  and arrest the heads of Google, Facebook, and the rest of them.
[26:34.000 --> 26:39.000]  I mean, seriously, they are assaulting the living hell out of everybody.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  I read to you Operation Lockstep three years ago on air.
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  And again, 10 years ago, we wrote articles about it when it first came out.
[26:46.000 --> 26:54.000]  And now they're deleting stuff that's reposted on Facebook and Twitter that I said three years ago about disinformation about this currently,
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  because I called their ass out.
[26:56.000 --> 27:19.000]  MIRRORS!
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  They're now implementing it.
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  And now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf A. Lois Hitler
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville Home Institute in Germany.
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  And Volvers will continue to selflessly fight this.
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  I don't know how long we can.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  The enemy's coming for us all now. God bless and good luck.
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  I would begin to get right with God right now.
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome. Go ahead.
[28:04.000 --> 28:05.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[28:05.000 --> 28:06.000]  Good, bro.
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  It's great last call.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[28:10.000 --> 28:16.000]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization, and absurdity.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the product.
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.000]  The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody.
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.000]  You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the M4.
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  Tyler in Maine. You're on the year. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  Honored to talk to you.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  Awesome. So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product.
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half, she loves it.
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  And it helps with the bedroom. So, just number one for a few years later.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  Well, it definitely works. It's not a joke.
[28:53.000 --> 29:22.000]  Absolutely.
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[29:25.000 --> 29:31.000]  They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off, $14.95.
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[29:35.000 --> 29:42.000]  We've got a private label with it full wars on them for $14.95 because I want you to get them
[29:42.000 --> 29:48.000]  and I want you to buy friends and family, these systems to educate them about what these, quote, smartphones really are.
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.000]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[29:51.000 --> 29:56.000]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal global system.
[29:56.000 --> 30:25.000]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[30:25.000 --> 30:30.000]  You know, if I seem angry here on my own show, the old show show, it's because I am angry.
[30:30.000 --> 30:34.000]  I mean, all I do is study these liars and I watch them change their story every day.
[30:34.000 --> 30:41.000]  I watch them lie to everybody. I watch them say, oh, 99% of people dying didn't have the vaccine.
[30:41.000 --> 30:47.000]  And then it turns out the majority dying had the vaccine and the vaccine's killing them and they're calling it COVID.
[30:47.000 --> 30:52.000]  And then they're saying, those of us that don't take it, it's our fault when none of that even makes sense.
[30:52.000 --> 30:55.000]  If you're supposedly protected, you're protected.
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  This is a giant scam.
[30:57.000 --> 31:05.000]  And then the main guy over the main bio research lab in the UK who's studying for John Hopkins and the whole world,
[31:05.000 --> 31:12.000]  whether or not these vaccines work, these so-called vaccines that are genetic engineering.
[31:12.000 --> 31:22.000]  And he goes, oh, yeah, once you take the Pfizer shot, it reduces your immune system by six times and you got to keep taking shots forever.
[31:22.000 --> 31:28.000]  He just says it out in the open like everything they do.
[31:28.000 --> 31:33.000]  Joe Biden said last night, he said, if you take the vaccine, you cannot get COVID.
[31:33.000 --> 31:38.000]  What he means by that is pneumonia, the flu, a cold, it's a lie.
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.000]  It actually lowers your immune system so you'll get stuff.
[31:42.000 --> 31:48.000]  And when you die, they'll say it's COVID and a new variant while saying you're invincible.
[31:48.000 --> 31:50.000]  I mean, it's just in your face.
[31:50.000 --> 31:59.000]  If you walk on a car lot and it's a burned out Pinto from 1971 or a burned out Gremlin from 1975,
[31:59.000 --> 32:05.000]  and you go, this is a brand new Ferrari with leather seats from Italy.
[32:05.000 --> 32:09.000]  You go, it's a burned out Pinto. They go, no, it's not.
[32:09.000 --> 32:16.000]  So you go on the internet and you type, well, I want to do this weird car lot and they got a burned out car.
[32:16.000 --> 32:18.000]  It was a Ferrari. This guy's crazy.
[32:18.000 --> 32:27.000]  But imagine if he controls big tech, he won't let you talk and he'll say this is a Ferrari and sit there and gas light you.
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  This is ridiculous.
[32:29.000 --> 32:40.000]  They're in the news saying, oh, stop testing the vaccinated. Then when they say they're positive, there won't be a problem because they won't be tested.
[32:40.000 --> 32:46.000]  But test the people that haven't been vaccinated with the fake PCR test and say they're asymptomatic and lock them up.
[32:46.000 --> 32:50.000]  I mean, it's all happening in live time. The murder of logic.
[32:50.000 --> 32:54.000]  And we're all supposed to go along with it. Here it is.
[32:54.000 --> 33:00.000]  This video went out a few weeks ago. Darren McBreen put it out on June 2nd.
[33:00.000 --> 33:02.000]  It took us over a month ago.
[33:02.000 --> 33:07.000]  Watch Alex Jones predict the lockdown for manufactured virus in 2018.
[33:07.000 --> 33:10.000]  Nobody really cares at Band-Aid video about this video.
[33:10.000 --> 33:13.000]  And Darren put articles over it, made it look like he did a great job.
[33:13.000 --> 33:17.000]  This thing, last time I even tried to count, had like 8 million views online.
[33:17.000 --> 33:19.000]  They took down all the versions.
[33:19.000 --> 33:24.000]  So now people repost it and it gets like a million views a day on Instagram or Twitter.
[33:24.000 --> 33:26.000]  Everybody's sending it to me.
[33:26.000 --> 33:28.000]  Members of Congress are sending it to me.
[33:28.000 --> 33:30.000]  Top Talk Show hosts are sending it to me.
[33:30.000 --> 33:34.000]  And this is just one little clip of my predictions from 2018.
[33:34.000 --> 33:37.000]  I just came back from Hawaii on a vacation, growing my beard for the first time.
[33:37.000 --> 33:41.000]  But the reason they took it down is they said it's disinformation.
[33:41.000 --> 33:49.000]  So how is it from three years ago, before the COVID thing came out, but it's still disinfo COVID-19?
[33:49.000 --> 33:52.000]  Because it's powerful, because it's truthful and it's off documents.
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.000]  But McBreen's gone and actually found the full clip since folks said, oh, this must be fake.
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.000]  This isn't real.
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.000]  So it found the full clip of me in the podcast studio talking about it.
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  And that's on Band-Aid video right now.
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.000]  The whole bunch of predictions, even more powerful, but they weren't predictions.
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.000]  It's from the criminals and their own documents preparing it.
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  Operation lockstep.
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  Crimson contagion.
[34:17.000 --> 34:23.000]  We will establish our new world order through the virus fear and then through global power outage.
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  This will save the earth from the overblown of our species.
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  These are quotes from Klaus Schwab.
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  So now I'm bracing for massive control power outages.
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  And then now they're telling you they're imminent.
[34:35.000 --> 34:42.000]  I mean, this is all going down.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  Now there's food shortages all over the country.
[34:46.000 --> 34:54.000]  Major grocery stores are empty of food, especially in blue cities and Democrat areas because they're so criminally run.
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.000]  And now it's starting to come to Texas grocery stores in England, empty store shelves, supply chain breakdown.
[34:59.000 --> 35:05.000]  An artificial collapse of society has been initiated.
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  And when it all happens folks go, Jones is like Nostradamus or I love the other thing.
[35:09.000 --> 35:15.000]  I saw like a tweet with 20,000 retweets yesterday saying, I used to like Jones, but he's one of them.
[35:15.000 --> 35:18.000]  They're giving him all the secret info, the secret info.
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.000]  They write books telling you how they're going to do this to you.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  Can't you wake up and take responsibility?
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  I'm talking to that guy on Twitter.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  And know this for yourself.
[35:30.000 --> 35:37.000]  Can't you watch the video where I tell you it's from Operation Lockstep, dumbass?
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  But see, they won't go research.
[35:39.000 --> 35:46.000]  So they attribute to me magical powers or I'm a federal operative who's been given the secret briefing.
[35:46.000 --> 35:57.000]  I'm going to explain this again because I do hard work and I research sometimes up to 10 hours a day, open source, actual government documents and corporate research papers and corporate finance papers.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  I know more than almost everybody because I work the most.
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  I don't call the CIA and the FBI get information.
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  They listen to me.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  I don't sit there and tune into other shows to find all my information.
[36:10.000 --> 36:17.000]  I get it from raw research and it's not about bragging, but I cannot believe like the superstition, how does Jones know this?
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  Because our damn enemies are doing it to us in front of everybody.
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.000]  That's why.
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  Bill Gates says he wants to kill you.
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  He's starting to do it.
[36:28.000 --> 36:35.000]  And I explained this virus and the deadly vaccine isn't going to kill as many as global starvation and the wars that come out of it.
[36:35.000 --> 36:44.000]  They know when they push, the average poor person pass half their money, half their paycheck on food.
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  The breakdown starts.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  Then people riot and burn everything down.
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.000]  Then they starve to death.
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.000]  Then the UN organizes them as armies to invade us.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  Do you think about this?
[36:55.000 --> 37:09.000]  Life Sites News comes out and says it's U.S. state and federal law that you can't forcibly inoculate or trick someone under the age of 17 to have an inoculation and anybody doing it is criminal.
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  They show the law and report YouTube bans it.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  Bolsonaro does similar things.
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.000]  The president of Brazil, he's banned.
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  His videos are removed.
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  Members of Congress have hearings.
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  They're removed.
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  Governor DeSantis has hearings.
[37:26.000 --> 37:27.000]  It's removed.
[37:27.000 --> 37:31.000]  This is organized crime covering up the crimes they've committed.
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  Google's invested it, Wuhan.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  Facebook's invested it, Wuhan.
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.000]  Facebook is heavily involved running it.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  Facebook employees work in Wuhan.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  Look it up.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  They're running these attacks on us.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  Of course they are.
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  And then I get up here.
[37:48.000 --> 37:56.000]  And I simply try to warn you off their own documents how they say they're going to bring in world government using A, B, C, and D.
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.000]  How they're going to collapse the third world by cutting off resources during global lockdown.
[38:01.000 --> 38:06.000]  Then they're going to organize the third world to flood the western world and collapse society.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  That's in the damn document lockstep.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  And now we're living it.
[38:11.000 --> 38:17.000]  It's like we broke Hitler's code in 1941 that didn't use it with the enigma machines, but we did.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  We have their communications.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  We have their damn plan.
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  And we're living their damn plan.
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.000]  But the general public cannot believe they're under assault.
[38:27.000 --> 38:28.000]  It's too scary.
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  Let me tell you what's going to be scary.
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  The next phase is of it if we don't stop them.
[38:33.000 --> 38:39.000]  So imagine this little one minute clip that's gotten tens of millions.
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  I say I count up like six million views.
[38:41.000 --> 38:42.000]  I don't even try.
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  Oh my gosh, three million here, two million there, a million there.
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.000]  All gone.
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.000]  All taken off the internet.
[38:46.000 --> 38:54.000]  We don't want you to see this mad man reading off a globalist fortune 100, you know, big foundation document.
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.000]  Here it is.
[38:55.000 --> 39:05.000]  Globalists have said in their white papers in their own UN documents that they want to create race specific bio weapons and other systems to depopulate the planet.
[39:05.000 --> 39:12.000]  A lot of this from my sources is that they're preparing to release bio weapons, claim that they're naturally occurring,
[39:12.000 --> 39:18.000]  and then use that as the cover for civil emergency societal control crackdowns on free speech.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  Obama put the internet kill switch in five years ago.
[39:21.000 --> 39:27.000]  And when he got confronted by Congress, he said, well, it's in case the bird flu or SARS gets out.
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  Just type that in.
[39:28.000 --> 39:39.000]  CDC says internet kill switch is in case bird flu or SARS breaks out and they have to control panic and direct every website in the U.S. to one government announcement.
[39:39.000 --> 39:47.000]  And we looked at every angle and believe a bio weapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem.
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.000]  And the U.N. has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[39:55.000 --> 40:10.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[40:25.000 --> 40:47.000]  We'll be right back.
[40:47.000 --> 41:02.000]  We'll be right back.
[41:02.000 --> 41:17.000]  We'll be right back.
[41:17.000 --> 41:32.000]  We'll be right back.
[41:32.000 --> 41:59.000]  We'll be right back.
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host of the Infowars War Room.
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.000]  And I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfowarsStore.com.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[42:12.000 --> 42:18.000]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfowarsStore.com.
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[42:21.000 --> 42:32.000]  Listen to this. Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[42:39.000 --> 42:44.000]  And we've packed it all in to FiberGreenCaps at InfowarsStore.com.
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.000]  I suggest that you do the same thing and right now it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[42:54.000 --> 43:20.000]  That's 33% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[43:24.000 --> 43:42.000]  And I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[43:42.000 --> 44:10.000]  And I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[44:10.000 --> 44:35.000]  All right, I've already covered a good amount of news, but nothing compared to what I'm going to cover next hour.
[44:35.000 --> 44:40.000]  I'm doing the whole show today. No guest. In fact, I'm not planning to take calls either.
[44:40.000 --> 44:45.000]  I need to cover every bit of this, and I've only gotten into about 10%.
[44:45.000 --> 44:49.000]  It's all critical. I'm asking you to stay tuned and listen carefully.
[44:49.000 --> 44:56.000]  Now, I was about to come in here and say the next thing is going to be a stage-cyber attack on the takedown of large parts of the grid.
[44:56.000 --> 45:03.000]  They'll see how we respond to that. They'll see if they get away, whether they're going to hit us with incrementally bigger ones.
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.000]  And that's the attack profile of the enemy, and I'll explain why next hour.
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.000]  They just walked up during the break and handed me three things.
[45:10.000 --> 45:17.000]  Crew did. This is breaking right now. CNBC, NBC, and others.
[45:17.000 --> 45:21.000]  Several major websites go down in widespread internet outage.
[45:21.000 --> 45:27.000]  Widespread outage disrupts major retail financial travel websites worldwide.
[45:27.000 --> 45:38.000]  They say, oh, well, that's just, you know, coincidence. No. Klaus Schwab and, again, the Davos Group financing through the Rockefeller Foundation,
[45:38.000 --> 45:44.000]  the Bill Milindigates Foundation, put out cyber polygon last year that I've been harping on.
[45:44.000 --> 45:51.000]  And why? Because the battle plans put out by John Hopkins are the ones most often adopted.
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  Because when you read that, that means Rockefeller Foundation.
[45:55.000 --> 46:00.000]  Why is that? Well, because they were the first to clone humans successfully in the 50s.
[46:00.000 --> 46:09.000]  And they've got basically, it's like an iceberg tip of a big giant umbrella corporation.
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.000]  And I say that like the Hollywood movie, Resident Evil Umbrella Corporation.
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  And so everything you think about something like that, that's John Hopkins.
[46:18.000 --> 46:24.000]  And by the way, I'll even be sitting there with really smart MIT scientists and other people.
[46:24.000 --> 46:28.000]  And they'll say to me, Alex, I hear you talk about animal human clones,
[46:28.000 --> 46:31.000]  but aren't they just growing the tissue of humans as clone tissue?
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.000]  And I say that too. Let me show you your own MIT website.
[46:35.000 --> 46:40.000]  25 years ago, human, humanoid is being grown inside the universe of cows.
[46:40.000 --> 46:44.000]  And I show them, they read at the dinner table for 10 minutes and just go, I'm speechless.
[46:44.000 --> 46:49.000]  I was never told this. And I'm like, yeah, because you're compartmentalized.
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  I am not compartmentalized.
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.000]  And my mission is not to be the priesthood where I'm compartmentalized.
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.000]  I know everything going on. And then you don't know anything and I manipulate you.
[46:59.000 --> 47:02.000]  That's how it works. That's not good for civilization.
[47:02.000 --> 47:05.000]  It's not good for society. And it lets corrupt groups get into power.
[47:05.000 --> 47:09.000]  And this group is a post human group that believes they're going to merge with machines
[47:09.000 --> 47:14.000]  and become gods and are running a depopulation operation, not to save the earth,
[47:14.000 --> 47:18.000]  but to get rid of their competition.
[47:18.000 --> 47:24.000]  So I'm going to hit that next hour, right when we start that hour.
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  And I'm going to hit everything else.
[47:26.000 --> 47:33.000]  But I mean, I really have reached the point of my head of spinning because this is all moving so incredibly quickly now.
[47:33.000 --> 47:43.000]  In fact, where did my stat go? I just had it just had it in front of me and I can't ever keep track of it anymore.
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.000]  I mean, at a point, why even keep proving this?
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  It's out of the open. It's going on.
[47:49.000 --> 47:56.000]  We have a ruling class that's broken the social agreement that's broken the social compact
[47:56.000 --> 48:02.000]  and is waging war on us doing it through shadowy cutout groups.
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  That's how they're operating. That's what they're doing.
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  And they admit they're doing it and they say,
[48:09.000 --> 48:18.000]  if you think COVID was bad, wait until we launch the, I mean, wait till the terrorists launch the cyber body gun.
[48:18.000 --> 48:24.000]  Oh, I mean, the cyber attack. Oh, yes.
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  So it's here.
[48:27.000 --> 48:37.000]  And I got a bunch of clips of warehouses breaking down and we've got some old pool chairs that are like six years old and broke and fell apart.
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.000]  And my wife's like, for a few months, she's like, I can't order pool furniture anywhere.
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.000]  Everything's sold out.
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  And I said, go to Amazon and buy it. It'll be there.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  She said, I said, I thought you said, don't you shop Amazon?
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.000]  And I said, it's just a learning experience.
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  Only these big companies are going to be able to have supply chain now.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  She goes, yeah, they've got all the chairs there.
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  They're ready to ship.
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  And I said, yeah, no one else does.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  Not the Austin companies, not the national companies, not anybody.
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  You go to local stores, they don't have pool chairs.
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  Nobody's got it. Only Amazon's got it.
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  That's the future.
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  Walmart and Amazon and Target got it. Nobody else does.
[49:12.000 --> 49:18.000]  They've spent the last year and a half buying up everything, shutting off the supply chains.
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  This is monopoly capitalism.
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.000]  This is fascism.
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  This is intense warfare against humanity.
[49:24.000 --> 49:31.000]  This is the social safety net and the social compact broken.
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  People ask, where is the charcoal toothpaste?
[49:34.000 --> 49:40.000]  The feds came after our silver toothpaste that we were evil, bad, said we were saying things we didn't say.
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.000]  That went away because I said, I'm not going to sell anymore because they kept accusing me of making claims I wasn't.
[49:45.000 --> 49:53.000]  So we put out charcoal toothpaste, high quality version, became a best seller, spent a year.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  Can't get it in.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  Can't get it in. You can't get it.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  Can I get some crap from China?
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  Full of garbage? Yeah.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  Can I make something in the U.S. high quality? No.
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  Can't do it. It's gone.
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  What do you think that means to our economy?
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  What do you think that means to the future?
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  What do you think it means? It means a purposeful breakdown.
[50:14.000 --> 50:20.000]  So I'm not bitching, but I told my crew a couple months ago, they said, boss, we don't have enough money to keep operating in the future.
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  And I said, don't worry.
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  We're not going to be able to order most of the products anymore anyways.
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  So I basically took everything I had on my own personal bank account and everything else started selling my house.
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  Went out and got a loan. You name it.
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  Mortgage my house before I went to sell it.
[50:34.000 --> 50:44.000]  And just said, buy everything you can now because it's going to get worse with the second lockdown and then nothing will be available because no one's ever going to go back to work because they'll have no confidence.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  And now they're getting ready for all of that.
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  And so we got limited products in right now.
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  And when it's done, it's done probably.
[50:51.000 --> 50:56.000]  That's what I'm telling you is this is an end game where there's going to bankrupt everybody where you will be able to operate regardless.
[50:56.000 --> 51:01.000]  And they'll do cyber attacks that shut down things for a few months to totally break your will and break your back.
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.000]  And I'm not glad it's happening, but this is warfare and they're doing it.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  So we'll operate as long as we can.
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  We get as much capital in as we can now.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  We got product in stock.
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  What we've got is what we've got.
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  You need to get it.
[51:14.000 --> 51:25.000]  Survival Shield X2, the deep earth crystal iodine, the purest type for your body, your stamina, your veto, your image, your immune system, everything, your skin.
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  It is 40% off.
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  Don't know, we'll ever have it in stock again.
[51:29.000 --> 51:33.000]  Got a small shipment, 20% of what we wanted to put in.
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.000]  They said, when you take this, it's all we can get at the standards you want, highest quality.
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.000]  Vitamin D3 and vitamin K for your immune system under the tongue.
[51:39.000 --> 51:43.000]  We got a shipment of a couple of thousand bottles of it in.
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  Out of cell, we got a cell at the price we got it.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  50% off.
[51:47.000 --> 51:52.000]  Green fiber, 1995 from high quality fiber from wheat sprouts and other sprouts.
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.000]  So it's incredible fiber with all the amino acids and more and a whole bunch of vitamins and minerals.
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  It's 1995.
[51:58.000 --> 52:03.000]  Down and out, great natural sleep aid along with it's not as strong, but it's still excellent as well.
[52:03.000 --> 52:06.000]  Knockout, it's in pill form.
[52:06.000 --> 52:10.000]  Down and out, slick with those are both 50% off back in stock.
[52:10.000 --> 52:23.000]  M4warstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine and separately Dave Lindell gave us the best discounts period that anybody has in his network of sellers.
[52:23.000 --> 52:29.000]  And that's because I said, I want the best deal you've got because some of his partners are great people, but I get it.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  They don't want a small percent.
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  They want to sell stuff for a little bit higher price.
[52:33.000 --> 52:34.000]  They get a bigger piece of it.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  That's fine and dandy overhead shop, please.
[52:36.000 --> 52:41.000]  When you go to his website, you'll notice all these different banners, different talk show hosts and people for the special deals they have.
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  Well, it's the radio listeners special.
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  That's the Alex Jones special.
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  That's the best deal across the board up to 66% off.
[52:48.000 --> 52:49.000]  Soon my picture will be up there.
[52:49.000 --> 52:50.000]  It'll be Alex Jones best deals.
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  I'm sure the other people don't really want that, but that's okay.
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  I'm out starting to fight.
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  It's there.
[52:54.000 --> 53:04.000]  All the deals are great, but I have the best deals you're going to get with promo code Alex because obviously I want you to get the best deal out there on amazing sheets on incredible.
[53:04.000 --> 53:11.000]  Towels and hand towels, everything on beds for adults, for children, for animals, for dogs, for cats.
[53:11.000 --> 53:15.000]  And they've got the sheets and they've got, of course, the pillows all there.
[53:15.000 --> 53:22.000]  My pillow.com, my pillow.com, my pillow.com, promo code Alex, promo code Alex.
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  And let me just tell you about a few other things here.
[53:25.000 --> 53:39.000]  You can also call 800-675-4614, 800-675-4614 specifically to get the Alex Jones deals.
[53:39.000 --> 53:40.000]  And it's just true.
[53:40.000 --> 53:48.000]  They are the best because I understand if you're another talk show host or making a deal and you won't have a bigger percentage for yourself.
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.000]  That's fine.
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  I'd rather have the best deal and sell even more.
[53:51.000 --> 53:55.000]  And Dave Lindell did tell me, the biggest, bigger than Fox News, biggest thing you ever had is with us.
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  So that works.
[53:56.000 --> 54:04.000]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, go to mypillow.com forward slash, they should create a forward slash, Alex, they don't have it yet.
[54:04.000 --> 54:15.000]  But mypillow.com, mypillow.com, and put in promo code A-L-E-X or 800-675-4614.
[54:15.000 --> 54:22.000]  That is the number for Alex Jones listeners when you go into their great system of folks up in Minnesota.
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.000]  And that's how you fund a operation.
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.000]  He's selling record numbers of products, thanks to you.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  But we have a smaller profit.
[54:28.000 --> 54:31.000]  That's okay because in the end it's a 360 win.
[54:31.000 --> 54:36.000]  But please fund us because I need to get as much money as we can into the future because they're about to shut everything down.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  We are under total attack, total war.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  We're holding out as long as we can, putting out the emergency transmissions.
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  God help us.
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.000]  We'll be right back to stay with us into hour number two.
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  Jacob in Ohio.
[54:52.000 --> 54:53.000]  Welcome.
[54:53.000 --> 54:54.000]  Go ahead.
[54:54.000 --> 54:55.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[54:55.000 --> 54:56.000]  Good.
[54:56.000 --> 54:57.000]  Great last caller.
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[54:59.000 --> 55:05.000]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity.
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[55:07.000 --> 55:08.000]  All right.
[55:08.000 --> 55:09.000]  Eric's in New Hampshire.
[55:09.000 --> 55:10.000]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.000]  Go ahead.
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.000]  Thanks for making my call.
[55:12.000 --> 55:15.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the owner of the product.
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.000]  The XQ does wonders.
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[55:19.000 --> 55:20.000]  Get off the fence.
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  Get the product.
[55:21.000 --> 55:22.000]  Support the Imp Award.
[55:22.000 --> 55:23.000]  Tyler in Maine.
[55:23.000 --> 55:24.000]  You're on the year.
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  Thanks for rolling.
[55:25.000 --> 55:26.000]  Go ahead.
[55:26.000 --> 55:27.000]  Hey, Alex.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  It's great to be on with you.
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.000]  It's an honor.
[55:29.000 --> 55:30.000]  Honored to talk to you.
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  Awesome.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the product.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  I think that only works.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  It's not a joke.
[55:43.000 --> 56:09.000]  It's not a joke.
[56:09.000 --> 56:14.000]  Well, guess what?
[56:14.000 --> 56:18.000]  It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV.
[56:22.000 --> 56:27.000]  And they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the
[56:27.000 --> 56:31.000]  T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.000]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down
[56:36.000 --> 56:37.000]  the road.
[56:37.000 --> 56:42.000]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine, because now they admit the
[56:42.000 --> 56:47.000]  COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[56:47.000 --> 56:52.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:52.000 --> 57:18.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  I'm a manager.
[57:22.000 --> 57:23.000]  I am publicist free.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  I am running the show here.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  And sometimes that means like a bull in a china shop.
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.000]  I know Mike Lindell's name is Mike Lindell.
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  I was calling him Dave Lindell for some damn reason.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  I don't know what Dave Lindell is.
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.000]  But that's because I'm teleprompter free and I'm out of control and I am a maniac.
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  So let me redo that plug properly here live and then I'm going to come back and I will
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  control myself and just put my head down.
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  I'm just doing too much research.
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  I mean this stuff is starting to get to me.
[57:50.000 --> 57:51.000]  Every man has a breaking point.
[57:51.000 --> 57:52.000]  I think we've all found our breaking point.
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  I think we're all in over our heads.
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  That's why we need God.
[57:56.000 --> 58:03.000]  My friends, there are supply chain breakdowns happening all over the world.
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.000]  And when I try to get products in like our charcoal toothpaste that was the best seller,
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  it's been almost a year.
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  We can't get it in because the products and the things that are in it can't be sourced
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  is that organic and high quality.
[58:14.000 --> 58:17.000]  If I want to buy something from China, it's absolutely open for business.
[58:17.000 --> 58:18.000]  They're ready to ship.
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  So that's an example of what we're up against and why it's so hard.
[58:21.000 --> 58:26.000]  We have a limited supply of survival shield X2, the deep breath crystal iodine,
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.000]  the opposite of the bad halogen fluoride and chlorine bromide.
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  We have a limited supply of it.
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  50% off infowarstore.com.
[58:33.000 --> 58:38.000]  We also have winter sun, highest quality vitamin D3, vitamin K.
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.000]  Take it under your tongue for your immune system and your body.
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  It's essential.
[58:43.000 --> 58:44.000]  It's 50% off.
[58:44.000 --> 58:47.000]  That sales going to have to end by, I'd say, early next week.
[58:47.000 --> 58:49.000]  You only have a few thousand bottles of it.
[58:49.000 --> 58:52.000]  And then we don't know when more is coming in because the supply chain is breaking down.
[58:52.000 --> 58:56.000]  I've got newscast all over the US, all over the world, all over Africa, all over Asia,
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.000]  all over Europe, all over England, where the store shelves are empty.
[58:59.000 --> 59:05.000]  Because the supply chain has broken down because the globalists bought up all the companies.
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  They bankrupted most of the others.
[59:07.000 --> 59:10.000]  They got rid of most of the middle class things.
[59:10.000 --> 59:14.000]  And if one person, quote, tests positive for COVID, even asymptomatic,
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  they shut down trucking companies.
[59:16.000 --> 59:17.000]  They shut down warehouses.
[59:17.000 --> 59:18.000]  It's a war.
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  It's chicken little hysteria.
[59:20.000 --> 59:24.000]  And through those collapses, they can then buy up the companies even cheaper.
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  So we're under economic warfare.
[59:26.000 --> 59:29.000]  But I'll tell you who's got five star ratings when it comes to customer service.
[59:29.000 --> 59:36.000]  I'll tell you who built his network and infrastructure and has thousands of employees here in the United States
[59:36.000 --> 59:41.000]  and sources of materials all over North America and from Africa as well, which he's proud of.
[59:41.000 --> 59:44.000]  That's where you get the good cotton and then they put it together here in the United States.
[59:44.000 --> 59:47.000]  And that is Mike Lindell.
[59:47.000 --> 59:49.000]  Mike Lindell is a patriot.
[59:49.000 --> 59:51.000]  Mike Lindell is fighting.
[59:51.000 --> 59:56.000]  He is bold and he's got his products in stock ready to ship to you.
[59:56.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  When you use promo code Alex, you get the best specials they've got.
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  I want to show TV viewers this.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  There's a lot of different specials when you partner with them you can do.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  And some people are going to want to sell up at his regular price or close to it.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  It's still a great deal because they get a bigger piece of the pie.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  I'd rather sell for less and sell a lot more.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  That's just how my brain operates.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  It's not some marketing thing.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  It's just who I am.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  Whether it's their entire line of sheets or human beds that are revolutionary and very, very popular
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  or animal beds for dogs and cats or the great towels or the pillows that they're best known for.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  It's all there at the radio listeners specials.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Those are the best specials.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  He tells me if I want to go for volume instead of individually making more on each sale for the percentage he pays us.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  And he's done great.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  His people are great.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  They've really come through and taken us out of the red into the black.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  So thank you all for shopping at mypelo.com up to 66% off with promo code Alex.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  And again, I'm not bashing these other people.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  I'm not bashing all the other talk show hosts and people that have chosen their deals.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  Some of their deals are as good, but overall the best deals together is the radio listeners specials.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  It doesn't matter though.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  At checkout, you put Alex in and whatever the best deal is, it gives it to you.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  I'm going to explain that again.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  I could go and sell at his regular retail price twice as much and then make twice as much each sale.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  I don't want that.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  I want the lowest price on the high quality products and I believe we'll sell a lot more than everybody else, which we've now done.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  So that's great.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  We're selling a ton of his great products, making a lot less per item, but overall bringing in more to funder operation.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  And it's a godsend.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  So thank you all for shopping at mypelo.com promo code Alex.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  And there's also a toll free number that I want to give you 800-675-4614.

[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  Lock up your wife and children now.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  Horsemen are here.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  They're here now.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  And they come to take your life.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to give you the biggest story yet that's breaking.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  Massive internet outages around the world.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  Who stands to gain?
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  Who has the history of doing it?
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  Who is the terrorist?
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  Klaus Schwab.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  That's coming up.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  And wow, Biden's off the rails behavior last night at a new level.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  What's really behind that?
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  I'm going to break that down.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  Top medical scientists coming out saying the majority of people that take these so-called shots are going to have heart problems.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  The majority, 80 plus percent of people that have taken the Moderna or Pfizer shots are now showing blood clots.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  And these blood clots keep growing.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  You ask, why would they do something like this?
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  It's an assault.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  We tried to get out of the new world order.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  We said no to the globalists.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  They came after us.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  But a lot of people online have seen these videos going viral.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  There's a lot of them.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  Watch Alex Jones predict lock-downs for manufactured virus pandemic 2018.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  This had five, six million views.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  They took it off Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, you name it.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  It's been re-uploaded.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  Last time I checked it, I was like, you know, one video is like 700,000 views.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  And they're whack-a-moling, not disinfo about the current rollout, but the warning.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  So how are you giving out disinfo about COVID-19 before COVID-19 was released from that laboratory?
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  Remember, you weren't even supposed to say it was released from the laboratory before.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  But now you're allowed to say that.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  I mean, this is just a cult of control freak seeing what they can do and assaulting us.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  So Darren put together a compilation.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  Alex Jones brought from 1998 right through into 2020.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  It's like an eight-minute club.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  I'm not going to have time to play the whole thing.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  But a lot of folks said, hey, we don't want to see a bunch of fancy articles and graphics over you.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  We think this is fake.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  We think you read a script.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  We think you didn't say this.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  That's why they also said they took it off Twitter.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  They said, this is fake.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  He didn't really do this.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  Well, of course I did it.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  It's all right there.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  It's an operation lockstep.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  Okay, so they don't want this scene.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  So here's some of the raw footage.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  Biological and chemical attacks are imminent.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  They are preparing us.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  They are going to create a crisis because they know that they can't deal with a real political backlash
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  and the restructuring and the reforming and getting back to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  Biological attack is imminent.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:06.000]  It's 1998.
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  Iminent.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  It's going to happen.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  It's going to be a question of if, but when there's going to be a chemical or biological attack on the American people
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  and what is their solution, they say, give up our rights, submit to Big Brother.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  The same thing Hitler did in 33 when he said the Jews, the blah, blah, blah, they're going to blow something up
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  if I don't take full command and round people up and suspend and set up checkpoints and issue license and papers.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  During the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, number 2002, they wanted to have forced inoculation nationwide for smallpox
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  and it came out in news articles that, oh yeah, the feds are going to use sports stadiums and postal offices
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  as the centers where if you refuse to be inoculated, you'll be taken and beheld, but will also forcibly inoculate
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  if we're given the orders at these injection facilities.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information that's powerful.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  because I've had chills since last night.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  But Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite,
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family,
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  everything that's in the other documents, but this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines and the hell we're already living in
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them,
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  I pray to God, I pray to my heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  and the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  and you just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards and I'm a liar.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  I know why because it's scary. You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself,
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  it will take over your life. It should take over your life.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  What else could it do? The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship,
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you,
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually,
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  the only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  When loser draw, you need to choose a side.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  You need to spend some time this afternoon, this evening, over the weekend
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  to close the shutters, to sit there in your easy chair,
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  and to just sit back and think about the claims I've made here
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  and decide on whether or not you're going to research the information we've laid out.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  In its 1968 yearly report, the Rockefeller Foundation acknowledged
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  funding the development of so-called anti-fertility vaccines
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  and the implementation of mass scale from page 51 onward we read.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  And remember, one of Bill Gates' uncles, Bill Gates' dad, headed up Planned Parenthood,
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  they worked for the Rockefellers. We've confirmed that.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  And this 100-plus billion that these 40 billionaires have put in,
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  38 billion from the Gates', 38 billion from Buffett,
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  some more billions added by these other billionaires,
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  the Rockefeller Foundation is running this.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  And remember, the Times of London headline,
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  billionaires meet in secret to plan population control, population reduction.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  And at the end of the article, it talks about a world government to carry this out.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  What does Ecoscience cover?
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  And it says, several types of drugs are known to diminish male fertility,
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  but those have been tested, have serious problems with toxicity.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  Yeah, by Sphinol A.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Rockefeller Foundation developed vaccines for mass scale fertility reduction.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  Don't say you weren't warned.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  They go on to say, using vaccines to reduce male fertility
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  was something that needed to be investigated further according to Rockefeller Foundation
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  because both the oral pill and the IUD were not sustainable for mass scale distribution.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  And of course, they want to do it by stealth.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  Oh, get your flu shot. Oh, you know, half of you'll never have kids.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  The other halves will have reduced.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  See, it's got to be soft kill. It can't hit everybody, or it'd be too noticeable.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  But they're testing how much they can get away with right now.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  You know, they want to hit those babies in the womb,
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  kind of like the UN programs worldwide where they only want to help the pregnant women.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  They come give them shots, and they all have miscarriages on the spot,
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  and they send armed troops to enforce the injections.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  And that's what America's turning into as well.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  I mean, you can't ignore this.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  Northrop Grumman bragged in a press release that it was going to use its cybersecurity technology
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  to innovate new systems, I'm paraphrasing, obviously,
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  but to innovate new systems to track the spread of infectious disease
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  and to develop more aggressive inoculation or vaccination technologies.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  Well, what they said, I remember that coming out a few months ago,
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  that they're going to come out with the new tracking systems where you've got to have your shots
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  to be able to go out and do anything.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  Well, I mean, they're preparing mass graves, they're preparing forced inoculations,
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  they're preparing under infra-guard lockdowns, under clergy response teams.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  You see, everybody's a bunch of followers in this country.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  When are we going to stand up? When are we going to affect change?
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  All right, there's literally hundreds of hours of stuff like this that we're going through,
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  because people do like to see stuff set in the past.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  So this is not fake, it's not CG, we said it all, and it's not hard.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  We don't even get the credit. I mean, this is all real.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  I mean, the globalists want to murder you,
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  and they've got the Pentagon and all the major defense contractors at the top.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  The new war will be against humanity.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  They are Skynet. They believe they're the machines.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  Satan runs Skynet.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover,
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  their robot takeover.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working,
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this,
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  to be able to find it off.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible,
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  and if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  So prayer is essential, research is essential,
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  getting prepared is essential,
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  and warning others is absolutely essential.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  And at the same time, supporting Info Wars
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential,
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  because they're great products for you and your family,
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  and they're also funding our operation.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  InfoWarsStore.com. InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  A lot of our products that have been sold out,
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies,
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  Vazo beats, and others.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com,
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  and wants to put in your body.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  They're now implementing it,
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  and now they've announced that U.S. policy is set
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s,
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler,
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  and the Eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  that trained the Coserville Home Institute in Germany.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  InfoWars will continue to set fast.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  They fight this, they don't know how long we can.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  The enemy's coming for us all now, and God bless, and good luck.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  I would begin to get right with God right now.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  And you know, you'd have a really entertaining show
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  and be informative and important,
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  but not as important if I just covered news like this.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  Biden just said he wants to ban handguns,
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  there's another one.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  Such BS, Liar Joe Biden
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  till CNN Town Hall Democrats
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  never said defund the police, that's right.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  Tell his own vice president, fund the rioters.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  Joe Biden clarifies that he's not hiding people
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  and sucking their blood.
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  No, just sucking their future and aborting them.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  You're right, you're just killing kids,
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  you're not sucking their blood.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  Sleepy Joe rambles about aliens and the man on the moon
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  in shocking fiasco.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  We could talk about that all day long,
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  but that's a diversion from the world government,
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  the Fortune 100 through the big banks
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  has created quadrillions,
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  thousands of trillions in fake money
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  and they look out at you owning your own house,
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  you owning your own business, you having your own
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  and they don't want that,
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  they want to get rid of the economy
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  and consolidate control with all the money they've got
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  to do that, they've got to bankrupt you
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  so you've got to sell.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  It's the old thing in the bank trying to bankrupt the farmers
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  and you know, hoping that there's a drought,
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  but imagine that on steroids
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  and then steroids again and again and again.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  Imagine that up to the power of infinity
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  and that's what they admit.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  You're non-essential, you're business, you're life.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  And so what did Klaus Schwab say?
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  Guys, we have that clip.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  I was wondering if that clip was Klaus Schwab.
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  The one we played a few weeks ago.
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  We have it.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  Here's Klaus Schwab, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  who really is a supervillain,
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  who really is a terrorist.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  And here he is just a month ago,
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  saying, oh, you think the lockdowns have been bad.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  No, my pretty.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  I need more of a Russian accent than a German.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  I need to get better with my German.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  It is now time for you to understand
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  that you will be taking microchips in World ID
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  and you are, should we say, in money, since you.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  And then he goes on to say,
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  if you'll sink, since it's been a problem with the COVID lockdown,
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  which he later bragged was so good for the earth.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  Oh, it's so terrible.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  You don't like the COVID breakdown.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  Well, no, it's a cyber collab.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  But don't worry.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  You put them globally in charge of a World ID
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  and an internet spill,
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  which is he'll protect you from their own attacks.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  You're a damn teed.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  They're behind it all.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  So here is Glashvab.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  Still, pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  of a comprehensive cyber attack,
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  which would bring to a complete halt
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  to the power supply, transportation, hospital services,
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  our society as a whole.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  To use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  to reflect on the lessons of cyber.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  So use the COVID-19 crisis, which we instituted,
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  to prepare for the cyber attack.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  This is coming.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  We will be your boss, though, when it happens.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  Yes, we get the power.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  You're not essential.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  Meanwhile, he writes books saying,
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  oh, we need a great reset.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  Oh, we need to shut down the carbon.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  Oh, this is so great.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  This happened.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  And then it's their very corporations in the UN
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  that put out the fear and the hysteria and hit the lockdown.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  They're the ones directing it publicly.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  And it's bemoaning the starvation.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  There's so much starvation around the world now
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  that new lockdowns are needed.
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  And I have trouble doing the Klaus Schwab accent.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  I have to work on my German accents.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  It's out of control.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:03.000]  It's in your face.
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  It's what's coming next.
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  Really important article.
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  I'm going to get posted on infowars.com.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  It's from zeroheads.com.
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  Klaus Schwab, the humanist versus Klaus Schwab, the terrorists.
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  And they're terrorizing people.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  They call for more lockdowns to get rid of the middle class.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  He says everything happening is good.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  Oh, I am very afraid that you're not going to be liking what happens
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  when the cyber attack happens.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  Oh, you think you'll make room now?
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  And the public just goes along with this, just bows down to this
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  and it's so obvious, but it doesn't even need to be obvious.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  They admit they're doing it.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  They admit they're running it.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  But people don't want to admit that these are predators
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  because it's too scary.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  It's, you know, oh, maybe a Muslim is a predator.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  Or we're taught men are predators or we're taught, you know,
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  white people are really bad.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  But oh my gosh, Klaus Schwab and Henry Kissinger,
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  these are good people.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  So let me take you to this point now.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  Schwab has been saying, this is imminent, the cyber attack
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  will in civilization as we know it.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  I'm so sorry for you, but it is good to end it.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  And then we've got widespread outage disrupts major retail
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  financial travel, NBC.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure website indicated that services
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  were experiencing an ongoing issue, though it was not
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  immediately clear the average was related.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  And it goes on to all this other stuff that's down.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  In fact, guys, when this printed, like I said about an hour ago,
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  it didn't print everything.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  It doesn't reprint me that.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  That would really be awesome.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  Thank you.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  And a lot of other major websites were down today.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  It appears as a widespread outage.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  Akamai Content Distribution Network, the CDN,
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  which helps data move around the Internet,
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  set on its website, it's investigating an emerging issue
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  with Edge DNS service.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  A company said it expects to provide an update on the services
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  disruption around 1 p.m.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  And this all by itself, you say, OK, what's going on?
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  But they talk about using the viruses,
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  using the migrants' flaws, and using the cyber outages
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  for a great reset and forgive world debt.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  Soon your computer not work, and soon all the money
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  in the bank be no good.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  We reset and give you new ID on your phone,
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  like your digital passport for health,
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  and then you will be, by the way, given free money.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  We will try to retrieve your money,
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  but we will have to pool all the homes and all the mortgages
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  and all the money into a new system,
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  and then it will revalue and you will be given extra money.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  But until you agree to the reset and the new currency,
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  you will not have any money.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  And, of course, you read the IMF World Bank Documents
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  for 2001 that leaked out to Greg Palace of the BBC.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  We had him on.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  It was the World Bank and it was the IMF
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  talking about how they were going to do all of this
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  and destabilize society and fund race riots
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  as the cover to collapse society to consolidate total control
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  and how it would help to have cyber attacks on banking
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  and that that unstabileness would make us accept a world ID
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  and a world system.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  What is coming down the pipe?
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  The cyber pandemic.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  Big report up on infowars.com from the vampire bad himself.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  Klaus Schwab.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  But Klaus Schwab is essential.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  You are not essential.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  Do you understand?
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  There is a globalist there having their revolution.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  But free humanity has to have its revolution.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  Worse than slaves.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  It is just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  Render down to be servile minions of the system
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  and a ritual of dominance and safety and control.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  which realizes a nightmare dystopia
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  It's that choice.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  Freedom or slavery go to evil.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  It is a spiritual battle.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  Infowars at the tip of spear fighting it.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  Infowars has been banned, arrested,
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  The great awakening is here.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  Go to banned.video.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  Download the videos and share.

[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  and never give up the fight.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  Infowars.com
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  Good.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  Great last caller.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  with all the gaslighting, the moralization and absurdity.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  for the point of the product.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  The X2 does wonders.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  I recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info war.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  It's an honor.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  Honor talk to you.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the product,
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  If you ask my better half, she loves it,
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  and it helps in the bedroom.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  It definitely works.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  It's not a joke.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  There are major institutions.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  There are major governments that are pre-prepared
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  for economic collapse who will consolidate control
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  and become more powerful through the process
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  of the engineer collapse that they themselves have engineered.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  And so, just in the last 15 minutes,
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  I was covering the globalist saying they're going to use
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  cyber outages and attacks to maintain control
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  and bring in their power.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  We've got major outages being reported
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  across the United States.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  Well, now this is being reported.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  FedEx, UPS, Airbnb, and Delta Airlines websites
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  all reporting outages as 911 lines down along the East Coast.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  Yeah, if you can't get rid of the police,
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  just get rid of the 911, huh?
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  This is economic warfare.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  Put a Crip Keeper up on TV who can't even talk.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  Demoralize everybody.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  That's how you take the country down.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  It's going quite well.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  And the average yuppie that signed on to all this
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  actually knows it's a takedown of America.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  They believe they're all about to be put in charge.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  The average trendy.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  They're going to lose everything they've got,
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  but that's why you call them useful idiots.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  Multiple major U.S. companies have been knocked off-line
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  today due to a nationwide outage including Airbnb, FedEx,
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  Delta Airlines, and HBO Max.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  Down detector also flagged issues with Fidelity,
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  USAA, UPS, Home Depot, Southwest Airlines, Costco,
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  Amazon's website, and around midday.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  Today, this is happening now.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  Agencies affected include Steam, Newig,
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  LastPass, Charles Swab, Akamai, Discover,
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  DraftKings, McDonald's, Expedia,
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  Google, and AP Morgan Chase Groupon goes on.
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  The Olympic Games website reportedly intermittently down
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  just hours before the opening ceremony.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:53.000]  Thousands of other retail, financial, and travel websites
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  battled technology problems.
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  And again, who shut down the pipeline,
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  the Keystone pipeline that cost $15 billion to build?
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  The globalists.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  Who shut down and shut down the colonial pipeline?
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  The globalists.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  Who did all this?
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  They're the ones sabotaging.
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  They're the ones opening the borders.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  They're the ones shipping in the fentanyl.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  They're the ones demoralizing.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  We're under attack.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  But we think because, oh, we're America.
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  We're the superpower.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  We're completely sold out.
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  By the way, I misspoke.
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  We have a big medical doctor who I had on MIT, you name it.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  Hell, like a year ago.
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  And he's going to join us next hour on the latest on COVID-19
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  and what's unfolding there.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  And then Tommy Robinson.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  You haven't heard from him in a year on air.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  I got a call from him at like 5 a.m. this morning.
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  Right as I was waking up.
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  And he was in court today for his speech and attacked.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  And we were in and out of communication.
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  We're going to get an update from him the last 15 minutes
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  of the next hour than Mike Adams has taken over
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:12.000]  in the fourth hour today.
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  Obviously, a lot of key information.
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  But when I tell you that intellectually,
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:19.000]  I'm upset about what's happening.
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  And my spidey sense is off the charts right now.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  It's just this is all an exercise in economic warfare
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:29.000]  to discredit the United States and bring us down.
[1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  There it is.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  A big announcement by the FCC.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  FCC announces nationwide emergency alerting test
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  on August 11, 2021.
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  Yeah, they're going to start to enforce coded transmissions.
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  That's the Internet kill switch.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  When they test that hard wire to all your TVs,
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  all radio, all cell phones.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  And I've been telling you about this forever.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  This has been the plan.
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  And now they're rolling it out.
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  So I'm really sorry, folks,
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:00.000]  but nobody helped those babies getting chopped up in their mommies.
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:03.000]  So we're going to get hurt real bad.
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  I'm sorry, everybody tried to stop it.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  I know you try to stop it, but hey,
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  at least we're on air still by the grace of God in your support.
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  And at least we've tried to build redundancy and backups
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  under attack to try to get the word out.
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  We also got a lot of infrastructure behind the scenes
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  to reach out to our radio and TV stations,
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  the ones that are able to stay on the air in the future
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  and we'll be able to send them direct feeds from us.
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  And then under that type of situation,
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  those local stations will be very special
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  because they'll be able to then be information hubs
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  into what we're facing.
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  I, like I said, I've really done my best
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  to try to stop this.
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  And people always ask when there's a big war,
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:58.000]  like why did the Soviets do this?
[1:32:58.000 --> 1:32:59.000]  Or why did Hitler do that?
[1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:00.000]  Or why did they attack?
[1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:02.000]  And it's just they want power.
[1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  And you're like, but they're going to lose in the end.
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:06.000]  Well, they better lose or we're all dead.
[1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  Because they don't want to just conquer us.
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:10.000]  They want to poison us and dumb us down
[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:12.000]  and then suck all the money out of us while we die.
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  Well, they sit around and laugh
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:15.000]  because they're the little white lab-coated scientists.
[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:16.000]  They know best.
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:17.000]  They're smarter than us.
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:18.000]  You know, they're invincible.
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  And I just want all of them to know you're not invincible.
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  And even if you were able to enslave all of humanity
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  and disease us and mutate us and deform us
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  and torture us for your own sick pleasure,
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  you will face God.
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  And all your talk about immortality
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  and hiring an immersion machine is all a parlor trick.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  It's all a slide of hand.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  It's all a fraud.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  And I don't mind any of it.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  By the way, I don't ever tell this story almost every day
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  where I go, oh, you know, a big national talk show host
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  just sent me this.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  It's not a cryptic name drop.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  It's like, I am so excited that all the big household names
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  you can think of that are fighting tyranny now,
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  other than Sean Hannity.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  He says, you know, take your shots.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  And I guess the government visiting Fox saying,
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  wrote the vaccines, got Hannity to go along.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  But, you know, Hannity's a boy scout.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  He thinks he's playing it safe.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  But, you know, nothing against Hannity.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  He can do what he wants.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  He can be on that side of history.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  And toadie around.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  But, and I still forgive Trump for it too,
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  because I don't think Trump knows
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  what he's involved in, but that's okay.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  I mean, it is pretty dystopic to admit that things are this bad.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  You know, Trump's all about believing positive things.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  That's great.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  Surely an economy, but they're actually taking over
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  by something able to then kind of deny it.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  Trump isn't really doing, you know what I mean.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  I got sent this, because I was on the phone two nights ago
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  talking about these articles out of the UK.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  And then I was ferreting around trying to read the studies.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  And I'd forgotten to actually show this to the crew,
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  but a little bird sent it to me.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  So we've got this.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  This is a pretty big deal right here.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  This is the actual British government documents.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  The National Health Service, the public health England.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  I'm going to overhead shot over here.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  Please.
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  This is where I'm going to get right here.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  Thanks.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  And it says SARS COVID-2 variants of concern
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  and variants under investigation in England.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  And I told you a year and a half ago,
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  their cover for it not working will be it's a variant,
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  but it's all just made up crap off PCR test.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  But they go and admit that 60 plus percent of the people
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  getting COVID and even more of the percentage of those dying
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  have been vaccinated.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  So when you hear 99% of the people dying from COVID
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  weren't vaccinated, that's like saying pigs fly
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  and the Easter Bunny's real and Santa Claus is real.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  It's not true.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  You can go read this whole technical briefing 15.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  It's already a month old from June 11th.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  And this is just them covering why it doesn't work
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  and why the people taking the shots are dying of COVID.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  And of course, it's the vaccine killing them
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  or the vaccine removing their immunity that now allows regular things
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  to kill them.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  And then they've got any viral material in their body
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  of any virus.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  They didn't say it is COVID-19.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  So there's one of the reports.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  And I mean, good luck reading these.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  I've tried to read these things, but it's all right there.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  So of course, they don't get you in a bear trap like this
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  and let you out.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  They don't snap their teeth down on you.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  And they go, oh, you took your shot.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  Things are back to normal.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  They're never back to normal.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  That's the trap.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  The average leftist goes, you know, it's you guys not taking
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  the shots when the lockdown's coming back.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  Really?
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  Really?
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  You really believe that?
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Yes, you want to stay locked down, fool.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  And listen, you've been gracious to come on in your car
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  in a purging on there in your minivan.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  We really appreciate you.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  But I want to talk about something.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  Keeping you operating in your thousands of employees,
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  despite all the persecution, keeping info wars on air.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  Talk about 361.

[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  at a very low price.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  You've got your towels that are the big,
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  that my wife loves, already had them before this.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  The pillows, obviously, and the geezer sheets and all of it.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  And people go to mypillow.com and at checkout, put in Alex.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  You get up to 66% off and hey, a lot of you did it.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  It got some great support into info wars to keep us on air.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  Mypillow.com promo code Alex.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  criminologists all agree on, and that its criminals are
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  extremely pathological.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  Even more the general public, they do the same things
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  over and over again.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  over and over again.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  Well, guess what, it was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  and would be non-lethal down the road.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  And the job it does is unparalleled.

[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  Let's get started.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  All right, we've got a special guest, medical doctor, MIT train
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  joining us next hour to get into COVID and a lot more.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  We've got other really informative doctors that have followed
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  this lawsuit dealing with the real numbers of COVID deaths
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  according to the real reporting systems.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  They're going to be joining us tomorrow.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  But I wanted to play a clip from an article on Infowars.com
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  by Don Salazar.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  It's a whole bunch of doctors in an online Zoom meeting.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  Warns of the threat that the majority of vaccinated patients
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  could have permanent heart damage.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  Some may die within three years, but we already had death.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  We already have them admitting that it can cause lesions
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  on the brain and strokes and it can cause heart attacks
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  for the body to attack its own organs like the liver and the lungs.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  So here they are talking about this is Dr. Charles Hoff.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  Before I've got 62% positive elevated D dimer,
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  which means that the blood clots are not rare.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  That's what the so-called experts keep telling us.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  The clots are rare, the big ones are rare,
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  but the small ones are clearly happening in the majority of people.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  62%.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  Now, I'll tell you what the real concern with this is,
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  is that a clotted vessel is permanently damaged.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  That vessel never, ever goes back to normal.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  So if this theory is correct, which it really looks like
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  by these D dimer results and I'm told it has been done in Australia
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  and it's been done in the UK and they also found elevated D dimers.
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  And they sort of discarded the information
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  because they said there's no clinical evidence of clots.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  Well, the clinical reading is because they're microscopic
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  and they're scattered and so you're not going to see clinical evidence.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  But in fact, all of the frequent side effects of the shot,
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  which are headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue,
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  could all be signs of cerebral thrombosis on a capillary level.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  I mean, those literally, you could be having thousands and thousands
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  of tiny, tiny little clots in your brain that won't show on a scan,
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  but they will give you those exact symptoms.
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  So the concern is I have now got six people in my medical practice
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  that cannot exert themselves the way they used to be.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  What medically we call reduced effort tolerance.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  Six people who now get out of breath doing things
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  that they could previously do without any problem.
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  So I believe that these people blocked up thousands
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  and thousands of capillaries in their lungs in these six people.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  So I believe these people now have permanently damaged lungs
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  because they have got, I mean, and that's why they get out of breath.
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  I have one fellow that used to walk two miles to my office every week
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  for a shock for his arthritis.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  And he says after a quarter of a mile, he's done.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  In other words, his effort tolerance is reduced to one eighth of what it used to be.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  And what did Dr. Fauci fund in 2012,
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  the University of Texas Level 4 Bioweapons Research Facility at Galveston?
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  Three different vaccines that were designed to have the body attack the spike protein,
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  not the RNA of the virus.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  And they said at the end of the study, they said,
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  do not make a human vaccine for this.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  Extreme caution, it killed most of the mice.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  That's one study.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  Funded by the NIH and by the National Infectious Disease Allergy Centers,
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  all of them.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  Fauci's name's the top of it.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  So Fauci didn't shoot in the dark with this.
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  They didn't just accidentally make this at Wuhan and release it in the scarce
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  and then censor everybody so we couldn't talk about it and then roll it out.
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  And then, oh, my God, the vaccine doesn't work.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  So you need more shots and hold the vaccine lower to your immunity.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  Oh, and the vaccine makes your body create blood clots.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  They did it.
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  Look at that arrogant little murderer, Fauci, when he's in the Congress,
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  arrogantly just staring back because he was involved in the HIV attack.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  He was involved giving him AZT and Africa to kill everybody as a treatment.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  It's what he does, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  So you can debate how bad the virus is all day and even if it's real and all the rest of it.
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  But the vaccine they made to counter the protein that they soup that virus up with,
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  the gain of function, the HIV delivery system, that's what it is.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  It's what the top scientists and Nobel Prize winners scan the virus.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  But that's all a side issue.
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  The same amount of folks died roughly last year, died the year before.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  It was a hoax.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  Most people that died had the flu or pneumonia and they wouldn't give them medical treatment.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  They died at home.
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  That was it.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  You don't have your vitamin C and D, you'll die of any virus.
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  But everybody keeps debating whether it's real or not.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  The damn vaccine's real.
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  The fact that it teaches your body to attack protein itself and create blood clots, it's real.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  Whatever the hell's in it.
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  And the head UK government facility that tested it said,
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  it gets rid of your immune system and I played that clip yesterday.
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  And you go, why would they send out the open?
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  Because they're normalizing it.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  They're like, yeah, we're going to teach you three-year-old to get blowjobs in preschool.
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  Yeah, we're going to teach them they're really a girl.
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  They're a boy.
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  Yeah, we're going to teach a girl she's a boy.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  Yeah, we're going to have her at 10 kind of breast off because we're Satanists.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  We're crazy people and we're getting away with it and you put up with it.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  So, so what?
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  Now, we've got one of the first doctors to go public.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  Over a year and now a half ago, Dr. Andrew Kaufman from MIT and the University of South Carolina.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  And we were to try to give him the floor to go over what's really happening and what's unfolded since he issued all these warnings.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  Told us who the best to give him the floor coming up and then we have Tommy Robinson joining us who has been off the radar for a year.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  And I barely talked to him the last year.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  I know I sent him money and equipment.
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  He was going to make a documentary about grooming gangs and he's still working on it.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  And then boom, I see the trailer for his filmable band on video and it's about the whole controversy that came out where they said that a Muslim kid was waterboarded.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  That's not true.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  And then he went and covered it and got demonized and attacked.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  And so he's made a film and I don't know if he's going to release it or who's going to release it.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  But I know that he was in court today and they supposedly said he can't release his film.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  So they're going to rule that he's liable and then say he can't release his film with the witnesses in the video of what really happened.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  Because we all know Muslims have never done anything wrong in the history of the world.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  So he's going to be popping in and then Mike Adams is going to be hosting 45 minutes of the fourth hour, the Health Ranger.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  I can handle stress, but I've been telling you this for weeks.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  I was going to take off next week.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  And then of course where I'm going, it turns out it's got wildfires are in the U.S.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  So I don't know if I'm going to do that, but I need to just spend time with my children and disconnect from this and hide my cell phone because I understand this is stressful.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  Believe me, I wish none of this was true.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  We're going to go through this together, but it's really dawned on me just how bad it is.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  But realize this is all a test and it's like Voight said, you know, when God touched his heart, it isn't supposed to be easy.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  This is a process we all got to go through together.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  But it's simply incredible how serious and real this is.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  So I want to thank you all for keeping us on air.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  We have two specials that will end in the next week.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  We have Winter Sun, the highest quality vitamin D3 at 50% off, a small shipment of that got in.
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  That'll be sold out, I think, in a week at 50% off.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  So you want some Winter Sun to boost your immune system.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  It's always great.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  But about as high end, you might be something better.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  I don't know about it.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  The highest in we can find of organic vitamin D3 and vitamin K taken out of the tongue sublingually.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  It is 50% off.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  X2 in the dropper model is selling out the spray bottles back to regular price because it's about to sell out.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  But we're going to keep the X2 dropper model on sale until it does sell out.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  And once it will probably get more in in a few months, but it's for your libido, mainly your immune system, your stamina.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  It's essential.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  And the globalists bet so much on hitting you with bad halogens that block the good halogen ionine.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  There's one good halogen and a whole bunch of bad halogens.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  And everybody doesn't have the good halogen.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  It will use fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  That's why they bomb you hard with that.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  We have the green fiber made up of the green shoots of the all the best types of shoots.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  So it has all the amino acids, a bunch of vitamins and minerals, really a high end green fiber from the wheatgrass and so much more.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  That's 1995.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  It's all at infowarstore.com.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  And it takes a lot of money to have your own satellite uplinks, your own shows and your own lawyers and your own infrastructure and your own encoders and all of it.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  But thanks to you, you kept us on air and we really appreciate you.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  So I would just encourage everybody to go to infowarstore.com and get their winter sound, their X2 while they still can.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  And we have a lot of great t-shirts and books and films as well.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  We have a new sticker that's going your door saying no contact tracers.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  Guess I got to stick that on my door because they say they're coming to our houses in Austin.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  We quote, better comply with them.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  And of course, their Bill Clinton Foundation runs it.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  And Google got the money to control it from our governor.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  All right, we'll be right back with our number three.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  Stay with us and please tell folks tune in.
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  You'll want to hear what this doctor has to say.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  And it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality, storeable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  Their entire catalog is at infowarstore.com, you get an additional 10% off at infowarstore.com, but only for one more week.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  But that's it.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  This is insurance you can eat.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  It's the highest quality, hundreds of high quality foods, three months, six months, your supplies all ready for you at infowarstore.com or call toll free.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  Again, infowarstore.com, 10% off on high quality, storeable food, ready to ship, but it ends in just one week.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  So take action now while you still can.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  They're now implementing it.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  And now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  Alois Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor, the train, the Coserville Institute in Germany.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  And before wars will continue to set fast, they fight this.
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  I don't know how long we can.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  God bless and good luck.
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  I would again get right with God right now.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  All right, next segment, we're joined by a very important guest is blowing the whistle since day one, Dr. Andrew Compton about what's really happening with COVID, the vaccines and all that really appreciate him joining us.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  That's coming up next segment.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  But now the police in France, all of the country have joined the demonstrators.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  This report's from five days ago.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  Now the police have joined them all over the country saying no to force inoculations.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  That's the good news.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  So here's what was happening just a few days ago.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  Now you know the new developments.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  Fragmented global architecture is not fit anymore for purpose in the 21st century.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  It's high time for a great reset.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  On August 1st, President Emmanuel Macron's France will require a COVID-19 health pass for anyone entering a restaurant or cafe, a shopping center, hospital or taking a long distance train due to the fear mongering surrounding the dreaded Delta variant.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  Vaccinations are really about individual freedom.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  Everyone can choose.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  That's not the theme here today.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  The theme is about the absence of freedom that is unfortunately continuing to grow in this country.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  That's it.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  They're taking away our freedoms little by little.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  Vaccinated or not, we are all together.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  Beginning July 21st, anyone over the age of 12 will also be required to show the past to visit a movie theater, a museum, a live theater, a theme park or cultural center.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  Macron's government also decided to make vaccines compulsory for all health care workers.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  We need to strive for having vaccination levels at near 100% across France because that is the only way we will have a sound future.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  This is why for those health carers and working in hospitals, clinics, retirement homes, people working in disabled care facilities, anyone who works in a professional capacity or volunteer capacity, working with the elderly or the most fragile people at home,
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  they will have to be vaccinated without waiting.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  It is compulsory for them.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  As of the 15th of September, checks will be carried out and fines and sanctions will be handed down for anyone who is not vaccinated.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  For all of those people who, for the time being, have had no dose of the vaccine, we have options available for you.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  Macron's big stick approach is slightly being walked back, but the penalties under the draconian law mean that people in France who enter a bar or a restaurant without a COVID pass face six months in jail,
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  while business owners that fail to check their status face a one-year prison sentence and a 45,000 euro fine.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  As unofficially as the EU digital COVID certificate, the pass shows whether a person has been vaccinated against COVID-19, tested negative, or recovered from COVID-19.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  Meanwhile, the Mockingbird media continues to fuel the tyranny, plaguing humanity.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  This Delta variant has me very concerned. As long as there are these clusters of people who have not been vaccinated, I mean, can the Delta variant or another variant eventually penetrate the protection we thought we had from the vaccine?
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  As long as the virus is alive and proliferating, there is the possibility for mutations, mutations that could potentially evade the immunity of the vaccines that we have.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  As protesters in the French provinces of Canada refuse semis hauling vaccines,
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  but the news people please go live. So we're being asked that a vaccine truck proving that vaccines are important. And yet if we're vaccinated, we aren't allowed to travel. So how are the vaccines important? No backstruck pass this point.
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  Back in France, the rioting and large scale protests have already reached colossal proportions as the French people grapple with Macron's full blown dictatorship, all in the name of the advancement of a new world order.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  John Bown reporting.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go to break here in just about 30 seconds, and we are going to come back with our special guest, Dr. Andrew Cobb. And he's been one of the main people accurately raising the alarm in the last 16 months about what's unfolding.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  And so he's the expert. I want to give him the floor when we come back and really have him lay out wherever he wants to start the history of it, where he thinks it's going, the incredible authoritarian nature of this, and so much more.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  And in my view and others view, this violates the Nuremberg code, all these attempts at forced injection.
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  Jacob in Ohio. Welcome. Go ahead.
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  Good, bro.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements. It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization, and absurdity. It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:06.000]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the product. The XQ does wonders. They recommend it to everybody. You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the Imp Award.
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  Tyler in Maine. You're on the year. Thanks for rolling. Go ahead.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  Honored to talk to you.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  Awesome. So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products. Alpha Power, even at 29. If you ask my better half, she loves it. And it helps in the bedroom.
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  I like that one. It works. Just don't joke.
[1:59:38.000 --> 2:00:07.000]  Absolutely.
[2:00:07.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  All right, Dr. Michael.
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  We got a bunch of big medical doctors joining us on the show tomorrow. And I've got a big stack of those guys that are going to be joining us.
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  And I've got this report here. Former Pfizer BP destroys media hit piece, attacks his warnings about COVID injection and calls them a pack of lies at the former Pfizer vice president and chief science officer, Michael Ghidon.
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  We're working to get him on the show. We have several big medical doctors on the broadcast tomorrow who have filed these lawsuits dealing with the numbers of dead in the vars reporting system and other systems.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  So, look for that to be coming out tomorrow. Here's that report right here.
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  Shock. Dr. warns the majority of vaccinated patients could have permanent heart damage. Some may die within three years and there is a lawsuit being filed over that again. Those guys are going to be joining us on the broadcast tomorrow.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  But right now we're going to Dr. Andrew Kaufman. He is a psychiatrist.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  He has a BS from MIT and an MD from Medical University of South Carolina. I'm not going to go over his whole background, all the books he's written and the things he's done. But from the very start, he has been criticizing this whole roll out and what has been unfolding.
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  And so I've got so many questions for him. But the best way to do this is just thank you for coming on and then let him start where he thinks is best. So Dr. Kaufman, thanks for coming on with us.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  Well, thank you, Alex. It's really a pleasure to be here and I appreciate the opportunity to speak to your audience.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  Where do you want to start? I'm going to try to give you the floor here to break this down.
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  Well, I really appreciate that. And you know, I like to start at the beginning because what happened is, you know, since the announcement of a pandemic in March of 2020, we have been experiencing a total change in the way our government handles things.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  And essentially what they've done is an end run around the legislative process and taken away many of our freedoms. And now, of course, they're putting a lot of pressure on us to take an experimental so called vaccine.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  And so when this started occurring, I said, you know, I want to start at the root cause because really everything that has happened has been justified by the virus.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  So I thought I'd start at square one and, you know, I come from a scientific and medical background. So I'm able to read the literature and understand what things are what.
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  And so I started looking at the articles where they say that they've discovered a novel coronavirus.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  And what I uncovered is that they put forth this experimental criteria that proves the existence of a virus. But when you take a closer look, it's actually the experiment itself that gives them the proof they need, even if you don't even have any source of a virus in the experiment at all.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  And this was actually carried out recently by Dr. Stefan Lanka in Germany, who showed that he got the same proof of a virus by doing the experiment without any source of a virus whatsoever.
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  And so I learned that they've never actually taken a sick person and pulled a virus out of a sick person directly and got it by itself in a purified isolated form so that they could study it.
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  Instead, what they've done is essentially use a computer to generate what they call an in silico genome, which is completely computer generated.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  And we know this by several ways, one simply just looking at the experiments that they do. You can see that they don't start with an organism with one piece of genetic material.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  They start with a big mixture that they don't even know what's in it.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  But also, the alleged PCR diagnostic test, which is based on this genome sequence, was actually used before they even had shown the presence of this new virus in any way.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  In fact, it was made completely based on the published genome sequence from the SARS virus in 2003, which also, by the way, was an in silico genome.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  We've seen other evidence, for example, the pictures that we see allegedly showing this virus.
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  Now, many of them are just artistic renderings created by a graphic artist and have nothing to do with reality.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  But the pictures that are from an electron microscope that are in black and white that show these round particles with the so-called spike dots on the outside,
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  that those have actually been shown in regular kidney biopsies from as early as 1999, when those people had nothing to do with SARS-CoV-2, obviously, or any virus.
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  And in the literature, the scientists, the kidney doctors who wrote this paper, they said straight out, these particles are indistinguishable from what they call viruses.
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  And this would be a point of confusion and should be paid attention to. And even in their article, they alluded to the CDC, which actually published another paper about this issue previously.
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  And so all of the scientific community is somewhat aware of this confusion, but they never acknowledge it and they just basically pretend that this virus is real.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:06:07.000]  And why this is so important is because, obviously, if there is not an actual virus that's even been discovered to be real, then you can't have a genome.
[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:13.000]  It can't cause a disease. It can't spread from person to person or do anything if it doesn't exist.
[2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  And once you can understand this based on the evidence that is widely available and published, then it's really easy to understand everything else that's going on.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  And of course, all the fears about your health being affected by this invisible boogeyman simply disappear.
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  All right, well, I'm not a medical doctor of the human brain like you are, but I've interviewed psychiatrists, I've interviewed MDs, I've interviewed brain surgeons, I've interviewed virologists, epidemiologists.
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  And we just see armies of them everywhere basically agreeing with what you're saying. You've been one of the first to come out early and talk about this.
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  But most doctors, my family doctor thinks this is all staged and a fraud and it says this new so-called vaccine destroys your immune system.
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  And then I've got all the British reports from their own government admitting it.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  And so this is very Orwellian for me. I've never felt so gaslighted as I do constant research and then they just meet us with this wall of shut up, you're wrong, even though everything they say is not true.
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  And then Fauci's perjuring himself, okay, did it come out of the lab? So my listeners are like, wait, is it real? Did it come out of the lab, Jones?
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  Or is it totally a fraud because the PCR test we know is a scam? And as you said, I've read the same reports where they have it, they never isolated it.
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  They use computers like Theranos did a few years ago to supposedly find cancer. We now know that was a fraud.
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  So I really see parallels between Theranos and what's currently happening. Can you give us your take on that?
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  Yeah, well, you know, you make an excellent point. And this is really the reason why they're pushing so hard with the censorship right now because they don't want the voices of these doctors who realize the fraud and the scam that's going on to make those things public because they want everyone to just comply and take this vaccine.
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  So really, you know, that's kind of what we're facing. But you know, if you actually look at the science and you know, all the science I looked at is either just from peer reviewed studies published in the main literature and from the government websites.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  You know, it's all there. But what they do is they just walk these talking heads in front of us, you know, like Dr. Fauci and many others who are really, you know, they're kind of in on it, probably getting paid or they're getting a lot of notoriety from basically
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  echoing, you know, this tagline that's all over the mainstream media. But the, you know, it's really difficult for many of the doctors because they know that their job is at risk. You know, if they go public with this and you know, just like what's happened to me and many others.
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  I'm still very impressed by the countless army of prestigious scientists, doctors, former chief scientist at Pfizer. I mean, this is the discoverer of HIV. I mean, all these people basically saying this is a giant fraud.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  When we come back, I want to go back to the original numbers that woke you up. We'll talk about those tell folks we're going to look it up for themselves and then ask you, you know, as my studies the brain.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  Obviously, they admit this is psychological warfare. The British government admits they're quote brainwashing the public with fear. How do we counter that? Because I've even got family that are smart people have high IQs who still just said, you know, shut up, take the shot.
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  We'll never be free till we do it. Now they're saying, hey, taking the shot doesn't make us free. So how do we get people out of a mass Stockholm syndrome? I'm not the psychiatrist like you, but I'll ask you that question when we come back.
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  We come back. Thank you, Doc.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  Brandy do right. Brandy do right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead. Yeah. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny. And for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your x to the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous.
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  Actually, people think I'm 55 years old. And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  You know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore. You know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  Michael Lindell is a man in the arena, a man after Teddy Roosevelt's own heart. People demonize him, they laugh at him, they attack him, but he's been proven right. The audits are coming out and there was total absolute election fraud against President Trump and against the American people.
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  And Michael Lindell is getting sued by all these big, powerful globalist institutions trying to shut him down. That's why it's so important to support my fellow.com and all the great products he's got and all the thousands of employees he has hired America because he's doing God's work.
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  And at the same time, he's funding InfoWars. That's right. When you use promo code Alex at checkout, up to 60% off on the best selling sheets and towels and the new beds he's got and the pillows, of course, everything, up to 60% off with promo code Alex at checkout at
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  my fellow.com, then you fund his rate work and our great work at InfoWars, a 360 win, my fellow.com promo code Alex.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  Big brother mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the InfoWars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  All right, Dr. Andrew Kauffman has been trained at MIT and the University of South Carolina. He's an author, researcher, but he's a psychiatrist. He went off the mainline science in Germany, in the U.S. I'm not a trained psychiatrist.
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  I'm not a trained medical doctor. I've had him on. I've read this. All I know is everything Fauci says is a lie. He says 99% of the deaths are from the unvaccinated.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  I go look at the British and U.S. reports. It's the opposite. They admit the PCR test is 94% false positive New York Times. You question that, you get banned on Twitter.
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  They're censoring congressional hearings. They're definitely covering up what's going on. Big Tex in bed with Big Pharma.
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  And he's one of the first prominent people to take the medical research that was out there and talk about it over a year ago and say this is a scam.
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  They haven't even isolated the virus. They're using computers to claim that they find the material from it and then saying it exists.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  And so that's my layman way of putting it. Then they say there's these new variants. So we've got to continue the lockdowns and the rest of it, but they never show evidence of that.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  That's really not your current. I mean, previously you were just pointing out the whole thing had issues. Now you're basically, unless I'm wrong, you're saying that the variant particularly is really something they have no proof of.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  So please quantify that for us, sir, in layman's terms.
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  Yeah, I'd be happy to. So I described before that they sequenced this entire genome and they did this in a way where they had basically fragments of genetic material from whatever would be in someone's lungs who is sick, which would be a lot of different things.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  And there turns out that there's like 56 million individual little fragments of RNA and they sequence those and we don't know where any of those individual fragments are from because we didn't get it from a virus.
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  Right. And we don't even know that there is a virus because it wasn't even shown.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  So basically they put these fragments into a computer and the computer combines them into over 3 million possible genomes and they pick one of those tweak it to make it look like a bat coronavirus, which probably was a predetermined outcome.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  And then they put that and they say this is the index genome.
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  Okay, so then what they do is they put out a set of instructions like a recipe of how anyone around the world can now do this experiment, except what they're going to do is in the end they're going to compare it to that index sequence, which is totally contrived by a computer.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  But since they're never going to get an exact match, right, because they're not actually testing a real thing, right, they're just combining all these random sequences together.
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  So every time they repeat the experiment by this recipe around the world and there's been something like I think someone said 40,000 of these that have been done, not one matches exactly.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  They all are a little bit off and this is what happens when you try to repeat an experiment that's invalid is that you don't get the same results.
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  But of course, all these different results they call variants and this is a very important scheme to not only continue the fear, but to ramp it up and then use this to justify everything but they haven't isolated and characterized any one variant at all and they've
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  done any studies even where they look at the actual clinical outcomes.
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  Generally what they do is they do some kind of computer simulation that says this may be more transmissible or more dangerous but it's really probably you know just people sitting around and saying how can we make this scary and how can we fudge the science to make it look like it backs that up.
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  So is it this the ultimate Salem witch trial 2.0 where it's this nebulous thing you can't see there's no proof of it if you throw somebody in and they they sink and die they're not a witch, but if they float, you know they're which but you still kill them basically.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  I mean it just sounds like it lets this medical tyranny take over.
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  Absolutely and you know from from the scientific establishment perspective it's like in this field and you see very few people are reporting on exactly how this they do this computer genome sequencing because they make it impossible to understand.
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  It's like three different disciplines like computer science right and which they know nothing about biology you have geneticists which probably know very little about viruses and then virologists and they're trying to come together and it's like the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing so no one fully understands that the whole thing is a sham.
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  Wow so I guess the emperor's new clothes would be a better allegory.
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  What's the best allegory of this.
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  I think that's a good one.
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:31.000]  Wow.
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  Again what do you make of Theranos we know Bill Gates is having involved funding that they claim they have this test to get fine cancer.
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  It used a bunch of computers and blood tests and other things.
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  Turn out it was a complete fraud.
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  I see parallels with Theranos and what's what's happening with this doctor.
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  You know if you start looking through the literature at technologies that they plan to use for various insidious and evil purposes you find thousands of articles and these include many things like gene therapy which is what we're getting at here.
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  Also various types of nanotechnology involving magnetic nanoparticles hydrogels graphene machine brain interfaces like there is a whole world and it this technology is not in its infancy.
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  There are actually many of these devices that have been already used in experiments and shown to work.
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  I mean for example they they even have nanotechnology that's called it was originally optogenetics and then they've changed it to magnetogenetics.
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  And they basically put an animal with this thing injected into their body in a magnetic field and they can control and alter the behavior of these animals.
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:19:03.000]  So we're really you know on the precipice of a major paradigm shift towards this kind of transhuman technology that Kurzweil and many others have talked about for decades.
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  It's incredible I've been spending five six hours a day till I'm totally exhausted reading medical literature that I don't understand most of it then I go and try to find out what they're saying about it.
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  But they you just mentioned it they call these new life forms they debate are these new species are these new aliens and they go whatever they are we're putting them in you as a revolution.
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  We're going to see what's going to happen.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  So really it's like the medical biotech system is raping humanity in a weird mass experiment of mad scientist.
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  I think that's the best way I'd quantify a doctor.
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  Well I totally agree and you know this kind of segues right into the question you were asking before about the Stockholm syndrome because you know certainly we know that fear is a major manipulative force and that you can condition people and manipulate them in all sorts of ways.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  And you know many of the techniques that have been used in this marketing campaign through the media and other sources you know come right from Edward Bernays and other people who are instrumental in developing propaganda as a as a discipline.
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  And then we find out that there were actually psychologists hired by the UK and probably many other governments but there was a whistleblower from the UK and they were hired by their you know health service essentially to come up with strategies to maximize the fear in the population.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  And doctors stay there. I'll pull the articles up during the break. We'll get more in the Stockholm syndrome. You're a psychiatrist. You can talk about it. Dr. Andrew Kaufman because what he's mentioning is in the news that quote mind control create maximum fear.
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:40.000]  And Yale was also involved not just Oxford and Cambridge.
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go what we do. But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate I still have one because this Trojan horse this
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  media fire has a lot of power. But when I'm not using it I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage a privacy pocket at info or store.com. We finally got them back in stock the highest rated that fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off 1495.
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  They sell these babies for twenty nine ninety five all day long. We've got a private label with info wars on them for 1495 because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends and family these systems to educate them about what these
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  quote smart phones really are. This is a great way to limit your phone time use. It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal global system. They're 50% off right now.
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:55.000]  And I'm for store.com. Ladies and gentlemen. Owen Schroyer here the host of the info wars war room and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to info wars store.com. Now I've been supplementing with greens fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to info wars store.com. But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away. Listen to this organic pea fiber organic alfalfa leaf organic wheatgrass leaf organic cilantro leaf organic kale leaf organic flax sprout organic quinoa
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  sprout. Ladies and gentlemen. All of these things are so incredible for your health. Just one of these ingredients can be a life changing supplement for your health. And we've packed it all in to fiber green caps at info wars store.com.
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day. I suggest that you do the same thing. And right now it's at an introductory price of 1995. That's 33% off at info wars store.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:08.000]  My control corruption of your talk destruction of your son my control.
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  Look, they made a lot of science fiction movies or authoritarian movies where the government uses the fear of a virus to take control. V for Vendetta did that back in 2005 2006, wherever it came out. They're now deleting a video that a report I shot in 2018, reading the Rockefeller lockstep program.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  And it got like five, six million views. They took it off Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. It's back up. There were like a million views this morning. I'm sure it's down now. But they're saying it's vaccine disinfo.
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  So if I had a time machine and I came forward in time, it'd be better. I went back in time. I wasn't talking about this. Currently, I was talking about how governments were saying and foundations were saying they would use this for control.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  Also, Dr. Andrew Kaufman is uniquely suited to talk about this from MIT and also psychiatry degree report government scientific advisors admit they use quote totalitarian fear tactics to control people during pandemic.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  This came out in mainstream British news. Federal government and Yale are holding clinical trials and how best to persuade Americans to take the vaccine that was last year.
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  The proclamation of national mental health awareness and they've got a lot of stories showing this and we see the mind control MSN.com. They have the Pentagon involved. They have the British military involved. I'm sorry, but it's too late.
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  Alabama doctor talks about treating unvaccinated COVID patients says they beg for the vaccine.
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  So again, we're talking to psychiatrists who saw this early on also MIT train Dr. Andrew Kaufman who I really appreciate joining us. We've only got two segments left. I could talk to you for 10 hours.
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  But you mentioned this. You talked about Stockholm syndrome. Finish that thought and go wherever you want.
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  Yeah, well, you know, you can see that there's just a major effort everywhere to control people's thinking on this and had make sure that they don't question what's going on.
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  And, you know, I really compare this to a cult like situation because, you know, the television, for example, and I would say, you know, the number one way to get people out of this state would be to eradicate the television or their access to the television
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  because if you look back at the patents, they actually use a special technology of the rhythm of how they refresh the images to put you in a suggestive brain state, an alpha wave state, which is, you know, good for learning, but it's also good for hypnosis and
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  programming, right, which they call it television programming. So this is a very insidious, but very strong campaign to get you to believe these false notions about what's going on. And much of it is about sensationalizing the fear and danger aspect, because
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  that's what will manipulate you to comply and to be afraid to question what's going on. But, you know, some people, many people are realizing that the allopathic health care system, which is turning into this, you know, bio surveillance and
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  transhumanist establishment is not available for people anymore, right, and they've been afraid to go to the hospital because of the virus. The hospitals have canceled many, many services. There have been major layoffs of nurses and pharmacists and other personnel.
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  So it's not available the same way and people are looking for alternatives. And this is an amazing opportunity to move toward, you know, the future of healing where we can actually address health in a true realistic way where people can actually heal and recover completely
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  from disease and not be dependent for lifelong pharmaceuticals just to manage their symptoms. And I know that, you know, you promote this area because many of the things you sell on your shop are, you know, agents that promote this type of real healing.
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  Let me ask you this question. I'm really impressed. I've seen your videos and I'm so honored to have you. Hopefully you can come on sometime for a commercial free special podcast. Those are very popular as well. But again, I just take this in layman's terms, street smarts. I don't have any psychological training like you do.
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  This upsets me a lot. It doesn't make me feel afraid of a virus. It makes me afraid of the authoritarianism. And most people I know, still some are buying it, but a lot of others are getting very upset. A lot of very calm, nice people really recognize this as a threat.
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  And I don't think the medical establishment realizes what they've done because there's a lot of good people, you know, in the mainline medical establishment as we all agree. But the fact that corporations have taken it over and are now exploiting the fear has really caused some major repercussions.
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  And the fact that we had so much trust in the medical system and I agree with you, that's now evaporating. I don't think this plan went the way Bill Gates and others thought it would.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  Well, you know, if we reference back to those, you know, what I call planning documents like the 2010 lockstep Rockefeller document, right, but there are many, many others from a variety of organisms, including, you know, the spars simulation and event 201, that there's indication from
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  many of these documents that the timeline of when this, you know, operation because I really think this is most accurately described as a psychological psychological operation and I'm talking about the pandemic that they, you know, they accelerated things and probably because
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  of there have been a lot of people waking up to the truth in the past years. And I think that, you know, the elites running the show putting on this operation started to get worried that they might not have an opportunity if they waited for everything to line up according to their
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  ultimate plans and so they've been making mistakes and doing things in a sloppy way and that this is really a major opportunity because, you know, especially if you're the person there who's, you know, afraid of a totalitarian state and the Gestapo knocking on your door to hold you down
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  and give you a vaccine, you know, those things are, of course, possible. But the way to prevent that is for each individual to simply make a decision for themself that they won't participate in any aspect of what's going on.
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  And the more people that do that, then the less likely there's going to be any progression.
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  What you said is the most important thing ever. Don't cower and fear when the college students come as contact tracers. Invite them in and have coffee and tea and show them documents and educate them and love them.
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:59.000]  In fact, I see this as a major opportunity. I've told my wife and family, I said, don't get freaked out when they come, especially if I'm there. Or I said, if you want to invite them in, talk to them because they want us to be violent to them so they can then make it paramilitary.
[2:29:59.000 --> 2:30:03.000]  I could see that psychology being set up very obviously.
[2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:13.000]  No, I agree with you and I might suggest a slightly different approach. I wouldn't invite them in your house because maybe they would see something there that would, you know,
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  You're right, maybe talk to them in the front yard.
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  But yeah, in the front yard on the front porch and don't give them information, but instead, I mean, don't give them information about you.
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:35.000]  Instead, give them information about the science. Like if you, for example, print out the consent form for anyone of the looked at the Moderna, it says right on there in bold letters.
[2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:42.000]  This is not FDA approved. This is an experimental treatment. Right. So a simple thing like that. It's right.
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:53.000]  You can also hand them the Nuremberg code, have the Nuremberg code printed up and just ready and just say, you know, bullying someone into forced medical stuffs punishable by really bad stuff.
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:31:09.000]  Oh, absolutely. I've talked a lot about the Nuremberg code. I've even talked about it with Vera Shirov, who is a survivor of the Holocaust, because she recognized so many parallels between the early Nazi regime and how they started to co-opt vulnerable
[2:31:09.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  people in the population for medical experiments and even euthanasia. And that's where the Nuremberg code came from. Right. And when I was a scientist in the medical school environment at Upstate Medical University, I had to, you know, I did human subjects research.
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:44.000]  And I had to go through this extensive training and it covered the Nuremberg code because that applies to all human subjects research. And it says that you have to get, you have to inform the people about the risks of the experiment and they have to voluntarily participate.
[2:31:44.000 --> 2:32:02.000]  And you have to take extra special safeguards to make sure that their voluntariness is genuine. And we've seen this completely ignored by every government in the world and not only by governments, but, you know, universities, private companies have taken it upon
[2:32:02.000 --> 2:32:14.000]  themselves to dictate to us that we have to take experimental medical treatments if we want to participate with their goods and services.
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  Absolutely holding us hostage. Well, well, I've always been impressed with your works to learn about over a year ago, Dr. Andrew Kaufman. What's the best place to get one more segment left when we come back?
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:40.000]  Folks, write down the best place to find him, YouTube, Andrew Kaufman, and we'll give you more information on the other side of Malik Jones, obviously with the demon eyes and attack to infowars.com and freeworldnews.tv and we'll post this archive there as well.
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:33:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality, storeable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices. We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:15.000]  Their entire catalog is at infowars.com. You get an additional 10% off at infowars.com, but only for one more week. They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex, but that's it.
[2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  They won't do this sale again until November, and then the food prices go up in 2022. This is insurance you can eat. It's the highest quality, hundreds of high quality foods, three months, six months, your supplies, all ready for you at infowars.com.
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:41.000]  Recall toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. Again, infowars.com, 10% off on high quality, storeable food, ready to ship, but it ends in just one week, so take action now while you still can.
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:50.000]  The biosecurity state is here. It's an anti-human eugenics operation, training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of GCP and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024.
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:12.000]  And in 2024, you will again take two shots, and he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation. They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates. They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville Institute in Germany. And volwars will continue to set fast. They fight this at about how long we can.
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  The enemy's coming for us all now. God bless and good luck. I would again get right with God right now.
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so, as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the Republic doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership. Well, that's where M4 comes in. You fund us, you support M4store.com, you get great policy at the same time.
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  That's our job, so please keep us on air, so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be the shock groups in the information war. Fund us at M4store.com.
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  Good, bro.
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements. It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore, with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity.
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the owner of the product. The XQ does wonders.
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it. Get off the fence, get the product, support the M4.
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air. Thanks for rolling. Go ahead.
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  Honored talk to you.
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  Awesome.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29. If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom. So, just number one for a few of you.
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  I like that one. It works. It's not a joke.
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  Absolutely.
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  A very impressive guest, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, will put up on screen for TV viewers, his website so you can visit it. He has written books and is an expert on a lot of really serious issues like suicide and alcohol and so many other things.
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  And so be sure and visit his website that you see there on screen. But the actual URL doc for radio listeners, give people the actual URL for Dr. Andrew Kaufman's site.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  It's AndrewKaufmanMD.com. That's one F and one N and MD like medical doctor.
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  All right, there it is on screen. Again, that's a doctor. AndrewKaufmanMD.com. All right, we got 10 minutes left. You've been part of a lot of knowledge so far. I got a lot of questions.
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  But what else do you want to get to? And I want to ask you, how do we fight back against this? I agree. We use this as an opportunity.
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  Every two or three generations face a real tyranny. We now have a real tyranny. At least we know what it is. We know the type of warfare it is.
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  And so I think it's actually an opportunity if folks get moving now against it, we're going to be able to defeat this generation's evil. If not, though, this is a very sticky problem.
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  Yeah, I completely agree. And I actually, you know, see a kind of separation of our society into, you know, two factions like those of us who decide that we're not going to participate.
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  We see the truth of what's going on and we're going to essentially start doing things our own way because, you know, if you're going to make a decision to not comply and not give in to what's going on right now.
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:48.000]  And I hope that everyone who's aware of the truth will take that approach. You're going to have to make some sacrifices, right? Like you have to resign yourself that, you know, air travel, for example, is not going to be an option in the short term.
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  And maybe that you're not going to be able to go overseas, you know, across international borders.
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  Which is just an insane level of oppression and control. I mean, it's just zero to 500 in one second.
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  Absolutely. It is, you know, unprecedented. And, you know, we never thought that these freedoms would be threatened. But, you know, if you look back a little over 100 years ago, there were no such thing as passports.
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  So people could freely travel across borders without any hindrance whatsoever. You didn't have to, you know, go to the government and wait three months to get a document and then have all sorts of problems.
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:33.000]  So really, this has been an incremental and a very subtle attack on our freedoms that is just accelerated out of control.
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  And so we need to get back to taking responsibility for ourselves. And that includes our health. That includes learning how to do things for ourselves.
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  That includes, you know, growing food and cooperating and forming communities and all these kind of things.
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  And I believe that with each individual making these choices and also studying law so that you can protect yourself.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  Because, you know, you'll realize that all of the practices that they're imposing upon you are actually not lawful at all, but you need to be informed in order to stand up properly.
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  And so we see, you know, spontaneously in a grassroots, distributed, decentralized way that people are organizing and teaching each other about all of these types of informations.
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  I mean, even things like, for example, you know, free so-called free energy devices or devices that are alternative like tractors that run on water and spinning magnetite disks that can generate electricity for, you know, a decade.
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  Those are the kind of things that are going to really make these things possible to be, you know, off the grid, but still have an amazing quality of life and get back to our relationship with nature.
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  Well, that's right, Dr. Kaufman. My instincts, I'm 47 now. I always ignored my instincts when I was younger, unless it was chasing a girl.
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  Every time I go with my instincts was really our unconscious mind, our genetic memories, whatever you want to call it, whatever people want to see it as, is your basic instinct has always been right.
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  And all my instinct says is go to an area, get a farm, get to know everybody, learn how to be self-sufficient. That's all my genetics, all my brain is telling me.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  Your view or your psychological study, I don't know your background, but obviously I mesh with what you're saying. It all makes perfect sense.
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  What would you call that drive? What do you think that comes from? And obviously we better listen to it because now it's not a tap on the shoulder.
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  It's like do it, do it, do it, do it. I mean, it's like a banging noise in my head, get out of the city, get self-sufficient.
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  And everybody I talk to that's dialed in, that's tuned in and saying the same thing.
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  Yeah, I mean, most of my efforts are toward that goal as well right now.
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  And I think what we need to realize is that from the time we were brought into the world, we have really been indoctrinated to a specific cultural phenomenon, right?
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  As well as the compulsory schooling system, so where we accept authority figures' word as the gospel, where we don't question things, we don't challenge ideas or think for ourselves,
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  and we don't take care of ourselves. We expect other people to be taken care of by the state, exactly the so-called parents' portray philosophy of law.
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  And if you can separate that influence and realize the fallacy of it and get in touch with your relationship with consciousness, with nature, with the universe,
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  that's when you'll receive these kind of signals that tells you, you know, we have to get back to our true nature as men and women, right?
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:52.000]  Which is to interact with the land, with the forest, with the ecology, and with each other in communities, not to interact with technology,
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:43:07.000]  not to be slaves for a wage that just basically allows us to subsist, and then as soon as we get an iota of free time, all we want to do is escape, drink beer, watch sports, play video games,
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  you know, watch TV, and instead of having a real meaningful sense of purpose in our life, which we can now regain with this amazing opportunity.
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  Instead of that magic moment with your wife or your friends, your children, on the edge of a cliff when the stars come up and you hear the cicadas and the frogs,
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  and it's like you're just magic, total satisfaction and fulfillment versus on an iPhone or a computer doing work, you just feel your humanity being drained off.
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  It's just not who we are.
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:48.000]  That's an amazing visual representation, Alex, and you know, all you have to do is look at the World Economic Forum's vision for the future, right?
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:57.000]  And you see that it doesn't involve those aspects and that they want us to have all of our social interactions to be virtual, right?
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:44:06.000]  Because that is quote unquote safe, but that is not human and it doesn't provide the basic elements that we need in our life like human contact.
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  It's not that a form of worship. It's like they said the Greek gods died in allegory because they weren't worship anymore.
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  They want us worshiping their AI. They want us only interfacing with it, watching their porn via computer, doing everything through it,
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  watching people eat food on a computer instead of separating ourselves from it.
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  We become slaves of the tool. It becomes the master. It becomes the robot god.
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  Notice all those examples you mentioned put us in a lower consciousness, a lower state of being, right?
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  It's about decadence and, you know, like the pornography is a great example because, you know, we have this amazing divine ability to connect with other people
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  and have this amazing intimacy and to bring new lives into the world.
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:45:01.000]  And that is, you know, can be totally corrupted by getting people addicted to pornography and taking all of the specialness,
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:08.000]  all of the sacred elements out of it so that it puts you in that lower base level, right?
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:13.000]  And then, you know, it's stealing the very life force.
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:16.000]  Yes, it is. Absolutely.
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:19.000]  Doc, I'm impressed. Please come back for a commercial free interview.
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  We've got two minutes left. Dr. Andrew Kaufman again will put your website on screen for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  Other points you want to make?
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  Well, you know, there are so many ways we can go, but, you know, I think it's really important to just be open to new information
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:41.000]  and to figure out what's going on and always check people's sources.
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  You know, don't trust anything that I reported on this show.
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:49.000]  Just look for a confirmatory evidence. Look at the primary source material.
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  Make your own opinion. If you can't, if you're not capable of understanding what's going on right now,
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  then, you know, spend some time to learn how to understand it.
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  But I really believe that it's more than doable for every, you know, average person out there of average intelligence
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  can take a few hours, understand what's going on.
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  And then that'll put you in a position to consider all the aspects about the future that we've been talking about
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  that you can take independent action. You can reclaim your human nature.
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  You can develop communities and you can have a really rich and meaningful life without participating
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:35.000]  in vaccine passports and, you know, other events.
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  So, Dr. Cobb, what you're saying is we have a choice to make, but we need to know the choices there.
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  The system wants to keep us so confused and so, days, we don't know there's a choice.
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:47.000]  We can build the future we want, but we have to make the choice.
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  That's right. And, you know, keeping changing the rules is a tactic to keep us off balance
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  and make sure that we just go along with it because we don't even know what we're supposed to go along with.
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:03.000]  Right? But, of course, you can also look at that and say, well, these things don't even make sense.
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:07.000]  They don't even fit what people say, like people who are vaccinated.
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:11.000]  They don't believe that the vaccine actually does what it's supposed to do.
[2:47:11.000 --> 2:47:17.000]  Otherwise, why would they care about what anyone else does if they can't get the illness, right?
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:18.000]  That's what they say about it.
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:22.000]  All comments, that's Dr. Andrew Kaufman. Thank you so much for the time. God bless you.
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:24.000]  Thank you, Alex. Great to be here.
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  We'll be back with hour number four, Mike Adams and Tommy Robinson. Stay with us.
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:35.000]  Listen, you've been gracious to come on in your car in a parking lot there in your minivan.
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  We really appreciate you.
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  But I want to talk about something, keeping you operating in your thousands of employees,
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  despite all the persecution, keeping info wars on air.

[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  The pillows, obviously, and the Giza sheets and all of it.

[2:49:34.440 --> 2:49:44.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:49:44.840 --> 2:49:45.340]  All right.
[2:49:45.340 --> 2:49:49.320]  Tommy Robinson is a patriot.
[2:49:49.320 --> 2:49:50.760]  Got the short segment, one more segment
[2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:52.280]  before Mike Adams takes over.
[2:49:52.280 --> 2:49:55.360]  I haven't talked to him in probably six months.
[2:49:55.360 --> 2:49:56.280]  I talked to him this morning.
[2:49:56.280 --> 2:49:58.240]  Finally, he has been missing in action.
[2:49:58.240 --> 2:50:00.600]  I learned part of it, but he was going into court.
[2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:02.920]  And so I don't know what's happened since then.
[2:50:02.920 --> 2:50:06.080]  I know that we financed a deal to him to make films for us.
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:09.520]  And we have the trailer for the new film right here.
[2:50:09.520 --> 2:50:11.280]  So I haven't talked to him since this morning.
[2:50:11.280 --> 2:50:13.280]  I'm going to play this trailer and get his take on it,
[2:50:13.280 --> 2:50:15.640]  find out the latest on this film.
[2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:16.280]  Here's the trailer.
[2:50:26.200 --> 2:50:29.600]  Well, it looks like there's a problem with that file.
[2:50:29.600 --> 2:50:32.200]  So we're going to stop it.
[2:50:32.200 --> 2:50:33.440]  And we're going to redownload it.
[2:50:33.440 --> 2:50:35.120]  We're going to check the file.
[2:50:35.120 --> 2:50:38.160]  No big deal.
[2:50:38.160 --> 2:50:41.680]  But that is all part of the craziness
[2:50:41.680 --> 2:50:43.200]  when stuff is moving so fast.
[2:50:49.880 --> 2:50:51.480]  So we're going to grab another file.
[2:50:51.480 --> 2:50:52.480]  We're going to double check it.
[2:50:52.480 --> 2:50:56.000]  And again, this is all of the Cedar Pants.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:56.880]  This is all going on.
[2:50:56.880 --> 2:50:58.560]  We'll go to Tommy next segment in five minutes.
[2:50:58.560 --> 2:50:59.640]  He's got to stay there.
[2:50:59.640 --> 2:51:01.960]  I have to push Mike Adams back.
[2:51:01.960 --> 2:51:03.800]  And I really want to hear what Mike has to say.
[2:51:03.800 --> 2:51:05.560]  He's a great brain, love him to death.
[2:51:05.560 --> 2:51:07.960]  He's gracious to host the fourth hour today.
[2:51:07.960 --> 2:51:13.160]  But I just need to get this played, see if we can do it.
[2:51:13.160 --> 2:51:16.400]  And then we're going to talk to Tommy Robinson about it.
[2:51:16.400 --> 2:51:19.560]  Again, I haven't talked to Tommy since this happened,
[2:51:19.560 --> 2:51:20.520]  since he was in court.
[2:51:20.520 --> 2:51:23.680]  I got a bunch of news articles here about it.
[2:51:23.680 --> 2:51:26.120]  And again, I'm so flustered with so much data coming in.
[2:51:26.120 --> 2:51:27.320]  I can't even keep track of it.
[2:51:27.320 --> 2:51:29.200]  Will you guys print me the Tommy Robinson articles
[2:51:29.200 --> 2:51:32.320]  again, please, about what happened with him in court today?
[2:51:32.320 --> 2:51:34.600]  And I'm not bitching here.
[2:51:34.600 --> 2:51:35.640]  And I'm not complaining.
[2:51:35.640 --> 2:51:38.360]  I'm just saying, there's just too much going on.
[2:51:38.360 --> 2:51:41.560]  I mean, folks, you know, I found it right here,
[2:51:41.560 --> 2:51:45.120]  you know national talk shows, planned for six hours before.
[2:51:45.120 --> 2:51:47.160]  They'll have a few breaking news things at the first.
[2:51:47.160 --> 2:51:49.400]  And they cover a bunch of pre-done packages.
[2:51:49.400 --> 2:51:51.040]  They've already tele-prompted it.
[2:51:51.040 --> 2:51:52.360]  They've already tested it.
[2:51:52.360 --> 2:51:53.640]  They've already gotten ready.
[2:51:53.640 --> 2:51:55.520]  The clips are already prepared.
[2:51:55.520 --> 2:51:59.160]  And a lot of these shows you think are live are not live.
[2:51:59.160 --> 2:52:00.360]  And I'm not saying they're bad people
[2:52:00.360 --> 2:52:01.200]  because they're not live.
[2:52:01.200 --> 2:52:02.680]  We are live.
[2:52:02.680 --> 2:52:05.120]  So I'm not ashamed of the problems we have.
[2:52:05.120 --> 2:52:07.280]  I'm not ashamed of the scrups we have.
[2:52:07.280 --> 2:52:10.760]  You see, to know that's what this is,
[2:52:10.760 --> 2:52:13.840]  is we have a crew that would run a regular local TV station
[2:52:13.840 --> 2:52:17.720]  size that's running a big national show.
[2:52:17.720 --> 2:52:20.640]  And so the number one rule is check files
[2:52:20.640 --> 2:52:21.760]  so that we know files work.
[2:52:21.760 --> 2:52:23.680]  But I get a lot's been going on today.
[2:52:23.680 --> 2:52:25.120]  So we're going to go to break, come back,
[2:52:25.120 --> 2:52:27.440]  and then I'll play this trailer, go to Tommy Robinson,
[2:52:27.440 --> 2:52:29.520]  see our news, hope that I'll try to talk to him
[2:52:29.520 --> 2:52:30.360]  during the break.
[2:52:30.360 --> 2:52:31.200]  Because I don't know what's happened.
[2:52:31.200 --> 2:52:32.960]  I don't know what's unfolding.
[2:52:32.960 --> 2:52:34.680]  He's been very hard to get a hold of.
[2:52:36.440 --> 2:52:38.040]  I know I had a film deal with him.
[2:52:38.040 --> 2:52:40.040]  Just to finance what he's doing to get his films out.
[2:52:40.040 --> 2:52:41.360]  So we'll talk to him in a moment.
[2:52:41.360 --> 2:52:42.640]  And speaking of film deals,
[2:52:43.720 --> 2:52:45.880]  we're one of the only places out there
[2:52:45.880 --> 2:52:49.000]  that funds independent researchers, independent filmmakers,
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:50.120]  people that are blacklisted,
[2:52:50.120 --> 2:52:52.440]  people that are banned everywhere like Tommy Robinson.
[2:52:52.440 --> 2:52:53.400]  And he deserves to be heard.
[2:52:53.400 --> 2:52:54.240]  He's a champion.
[2:52:54.240 --> 2:52:55.080]  We're proud of him.
[2:52:55.080 --> 2:52:56.320]  You never really hear about him, do you?
[2:52:56.320 --> 2:53:00.920]  Because he's blacklisted everywhere, but banned on video.
[2:53:02.240 --> 2:53:04.920]  And so when you buy a book or a film
[2:53:04.920 --> 2:53:07.720]  or a sustainable food or get some supplements
[2:53:07.720 --> 2:53:10.480]  or whatever it is at infowarstore.com,
[2:53:12.120 --> 2:53:16.080]  you are financing people that have been champions
[2:53:16.080 --> 2:53:18.880]  of freedom who have been put in prison and tortured
[2:53:18.880 --> 2:53:21.120]  having a voice.
[2:53:21.120 --> 2:53:23.160]  We're getting people out of digital prison
[2:53:23.160 --> 2:53:25.360]  and getting them at banned on video.
[2:53:25.360 --> 2:53:27.200]  But the only way we're able to do that is
[2:53:27.200 --> 2:53:28.560]  we get them out of the digital prison
[2:53:28.560 --> 2:53:32.960]  of having no voice to on banned on video to our audience.
[2:53:32.960 --> 2:53:36.280]  But the only way you're an ambassador to get that out,
[2:53:36.280 --> 2:53:38.800]  that's the only way then it reaches new people.
[2:53:38.800 --> 2:53:40.360]  So we love you and we appreciate you.
[2:53:40.360 --> 2:53:42.240]  But when you call in and think me,
[2:53:42.240 --> 2:53:45.120]  just let me get on my knees and kiss your feet listeners.
[2:53:45.120 --> 2:53:46.480]  All I want to do is fight the globalists.
[2:53:46.480 --> 2:53:47.720]  All I want to do is win.
[2:53:47.720 --> 2:53:49.480]  All I want to do is take these people on.
[2:53:49.480 --> 2:53:53.440]  All I want to do is have liberty and freedom.
[2:53:53.440 --> 2:53:55.440]  So, but imagine it's like I'm a quadriplegic.
[2:53:55.440 --> 2:53:57.480]  I'm paralyzed politically.
[2:53:57.480 --> 2:53:59.280]  So is Tommy, even more than I am.
[2:53:59.280 --> 2:54:01.200]  We can only swing and punch back.
[2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:04.040]  When you get mad, you take our material and you push it out.
[2:54:04.040 --> 2:54:05.800]  Then suddenly my arm finally works
[2:54:05.800 --> 2:54:07.440]  and I can fight back again.
[2:54:07.440 --> 2:54:08.560]  But you know what that feels like?
[2:54:08.560 --> 2:54:10.000]  It's not fun.
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:11.320]  Apparently the old days five years ago
[2:54:11.320 --> 2:54:12.920]  when I could just take the globalist on,
[2:54:12.920 --> 2:54:15.120]  point blank range, total viral videos,
[2:54:15.120 --> 2:54:17.400]  win, win, win, count them in real time.
[2:54:17.400 --> 2:54:20.280]  So they silenced us and froze us down to info wars.
[2:54:20.280 --> 2:54:22.440]  But you can take what we're doing here
[2:54:22.440 --> 2:54:23.440]  and you can get it out there.
[2:54:23.440 --> 2:54:25.480]  And that's how it has a major effect.
[2:54:25.480 --> 2:54:28.080]  Back in 60 seconds, with the trailer for this film,
[2:54:28.080 --> 2:54:29.440]  we were financing.
[2:54:29.440 --> 2:54:32.920]  And then we'll get the latest from our great friend,
[2:54:32.920 --> 2:54:33.760]  Tommy Robinson.
[2:54:33.760 --> 2:54:35.160]  Stay with us back in 60 seconds.
[2:54:39.720 --> 2:54:41.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here,
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:42.720]  the host of the Info Wars War Room.
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:46.760]  And I am very excited about our latest supplement edition
[2:54:46.760 --> 2:54:48.240]  to infowarstore.com.
[2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:50.800]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers,
[2:54:50.800 --> 2:54:53.200]  and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[2:54:53.200 --> 2:54:55.920]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own
[2:54:55.920 --> 2:54:58.800]  greens fiber caps to infowarstore.com.
[2:54:58.800 --> 2:55:01.720]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[2:55:01.720 --> 2:55:02.840]  Listen to this.
[2:55:02.840 --> 2:55:05.560]  Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf,
[2:55:05.560 --> 2:55:08.440]  organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf,

[2:55:11.400 --> 2:55:13.040]  organic quinoa sprout.

[2:55:16.520 --> 2:55:18.320]  Just one of these ingredients can be
[2:55:18.320 --> 2:55:20.320]  a life changing supplement for your health.

[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:56.480]  MUSIC
[2:55:56.480 --> 2:56:01.920]  Tommy Robinson is a folk hero in the United Kingdom.
[2:56:01.920 --> 2:56:04.720]  12, 13 years ago, found them smuggling little girls,
[2:56:04.720 --> 2:56:07.600]  kidnapping them, grooming them, raping them,
[2:56:07.600 --> 2:56:09.520]  and killing them.
[2:56:09.520 --> 2:56:12.120]  And years after he exposed it, five, six years after it,
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:14.200]  came out in the news, in the one town
[2:56:14.200 --> 2:56:16.640]  he talked about, thousands of kidnapped little girls,
[2:56:16.640 --> 2:56:17.800]  some of them murdered.
[2:56:17.800 --> 2:56:20.920]  TR.News, Tommy Robinson, I've been
[2:56:20.920 --> 2:56:22.040]  trying to get him on for a year.
[2:56:22.040 --> 2:56:22.800]  He's been gone.
[2:56:22.800 --> 2:56:23.640]  He's been disappeared.
[2:56:23.640 --> 2:56:25.120]  I bought him cameras.
[2:56:25.120 --> 2:56:25.800]  I'm not bitching.
[2:56:25.800 --> 2:56:27.120]  I'm just saying, I got him cameras,
[2:56:27.120 --> 2:56:28.400]  gave them money to do it.
[2:56:28.400 --> 2:56:29.720]  He got thrown in prison.
[2:56:29.720 --> 2:56:31.520]  I wanted to film about the grooming.
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:34.960]  I wanted to film about the boats coming across from Europe
[2:56:34.960 --> 2:56:36.720]  with the Islamic invaders.
[2:56:36.720 --> 2:56:39.720]  I got a call at like 5 AM this morning and Tommy doesn't know.
[2:56:39.720 --> 2:56:41.760]  He says, I'm going to find out later.
[2:56:41.760 --> 2:56:43.360]  I'll talk to you this afternoon.
[2:56:43.360 --> 2:56:45.320]  But then I noticed that it's already
[2:56:45.320 --> 2:56:47.640]  uploaded this trailer.
[2:56:47.640 --> 2:56:50.840]  And so I wanted you to see this for the new film,
[2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:54.240]  because it's a big national news story.
[2:56:54.240 --> 2:56:55.440]  Here it is out of the BBC.
[2:56:55.440 --> 2:57:02.240]  Tommy Robinson loses libel case with Jamal Hajazi.
[2:57:02.240 --> 2:57:02.840]  Now, remember that.
[2:57:02.840 --> 2:57:04.960]  Remember this appears Morgan attacking him, saying,
[2:57:04.960 --> 2:57:07.680]  no, the evil white people, the evil English were
[2:57:07.680 --> 2:57:09.640]  waterboarding a poor Muslim.
[2:57:09.640 --> 2:57:10.920]  But what really happened?
[2:57:10.920 --> 2:57:12.280]  Well, Tommy covered that.
[2:57:12.280 --> 2:57:14.360]  And they say he lost a libel case today.
[2:57:14.360 --> 2:57:17.080]  Well, here's a trailer for a film.
[2:57:17.080 --> 2:57:18.680]  I know he was going to be releasing soon.
[2:57:18.680 --> 2:57:20.280]  We'll ask him when it's coming out in a moment.
[2:57:20.280 --> 2:57:21.880]  Here it is.
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:24.640]  Everybody was exposing the scumbag that did this,
[2:57:24.640 --> 2:57:27.160]  who I hope gets severe retribution.
[2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:28.960]  I hope his parents take action.
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:31.000]  All right, never mind anything else.
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:34.120]  What are you producing here with this verny?
[2:57:34.120 --> 2:57:35.760]  I'm here because I face a court case.
[2:57:35.760 --> 2:57:36.760]  I'm being prosecuted.
[2:57:36.760 --> 2:57:38.040]  It's gone to the high court.
[2:57:38.040 --> 2:57:41.240]  And I have to prove, I made a video stating that it was a lie,
[2:57:41.240 --> 2:57:42.880]  stating that Jamal wasn't innocent,
[2:57:42.880 --> 2:57:45.440]  and telling some facts about Jamal beating up girls.
[2:57:45.440 --> 2:57:47.760]  An instance I'd been warned about by the members of this
[2:57:47.760 --> 2:57:50.520]  community to tell the truth about what happened at this school.
[2:57:50.520 --> 2:57:51.840]  You've got everything here.
[2:57:51.840 --> 2:57:52.720]  Cameras, glasses.
[2:57:52.720 --> 2:57:54.600]  I don't wear glasses, so that's going to be awkward.
[2:57:54.600 --> 2:57:55.600]  I feel like James Bond.
[2:57:55.600 --> 2:57:58.080]  It is a mess, but it's a tragedy.
[2:57:58.080 --> 2:57:59.360]  It's a tragedy for the only.
[2:57:59.360 --> 2:58:02.640]  The idea that people would mow the streets looking for him
[2:58:02.640 --> 2:58:03.600]  was appalling.
[2:58:03.600 --> 2:58:06.560]  You were that one man who ate that girl with hockey stick,
[2:58:06.560 --> 2:58:07.400]  weren't you?
[2:58:07.400 --> 2:58:09.640]  We were playing hockey with a teacher on Mr Cattell
[2:58:09.640 --> 2:58:11.920]  and just felt a really sharp pain in my back,
[2:58:11.920 --> 2:58:13.960]  and he'd swung the hockey stick over his head
[2:58:13.960 --> 2:58:15.640]  and hit me in the spine with it.
[2:58:15.640 --> 2:58:16.960]  It knocked me to my knees.
[2:58:16.960 --> 2:58:18.440]  Jamal grabbed him by his tie,
[2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:19.600]  and he was just threw him against the wall,
[2:58:19.600 --> 2:58:21.320]  cracked his head open against back at wall,
[2:58:21.320 --> 2:58:22.760]  and just kept throwing him against the wall.
[2:58:22.760 --> 2:58:24.840]  This kid was out unconscious already.
[2:58:24.840 --> 2:58:26.240]  That's just malicious.
[2:58:26.240 --> 2:58:28.160]  That's just intent to kill.
[2:58:28.160 --> 2:58:29.880]  If you could sum up Jamal then after meeting him,
[2:58:29.880 --> 2:58:31.120]  if you could sum him up in a few words,
[2:58:31.120 --> 2:58:32.720]  what would you describe him?
[2:58:32.720 --> 2:58:33.560]  Lather.
[2:58:33.560 --> 2:58:35.040]  Because Bailey's life was destroyed.
[2:58:35.040 --> 2:58:36.160]  Yeah.
[2:58:36.160 --> 2:58:38.120]  The whole country turned on him over this.
[2:58:38.120 --> 2:58:40.960]  This is the accommodation that Bailey's mother
[2:58:40.960 --> 2:58:43.160]  and children were being relocated to.
[2:58:43.160 --> 2:58:44.480]  No one cared for this family.
[2:58:44.480 --> 2:58:46.680]  They were all casualties of this lie.
[2:58:46.680 --> 2:58:48.320]  The media should be held accountable for this.
[2:58:48.320 --> 2:58:50.560]  It went to China, it went to Australia, it went everywhere.
[2:58:50.560 --> 2:58:52.920]  It wasn't global news, they made it global news.
[2:58:52.920 --> 2:58:56.040]  Every kid I spoke to that he attacked was younger.
[2:58:56.040 --> 2:58:57.840]  Yeah, more like.
[2:58:57.840 --> 2:58:58.680]  Jamal, who's Jamal?
[2:58:58.680 --> 2:58:59.520]  Yeah.
[2:58:59.520 --> 2:59:00.800]  Everyone's confirming what Jamal was like,
[2:59:00.800 --> 2:59:02.840]  including school staff.
[2:59:02.840 --> 2:59:05.280]  But as soon as I mentioned this camera,
[2:59:05.280 --> 2:59:07.080]  as soon as I mentioned court,
[2:59:07.080 --> 2:59:08.640]  I need someone to come to court.
[2:59:08.640 --> 2:59:10.040]  They just totally silenced travel.
[2:59:10.040 --> 2:59:11.760]  No, no, no one can know I've said that.
[2:59:11.760 --> 2:59:12.880]  He started calling me,
[2:59:12.880 --> 2:59:14.320]  you know, I've got f***ing shoes and stuff
[2:59:14.320 --> 2:59:15.960]  and then he put me in a head dog
[2:59:15.960 --> 2:59:17.720]  and then my rep pushed him off me.
[2:59:17.720 --> 2:59:19.160]  I believe that's how he broke his arm.
[2:59:19.160 --> 2:59:21.280]  This is about as much as proving in court,
[2:59:21.280 --> 2:59:23.240]  as proving to you, the British public,
[2:59:23.240 --> 2:59:25.640]  that I was the only journalist in the country
[2:59:25.640 --> 2:59:28.800]  who told the truth about what happened in this community.
[2:59:28.800 --> 2:59:30.000]  I call it the perfect school.
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:32.680]  I was getting emails from Pakistan,
[2:59:32.680 --> 2:59:35.400]  from Australia, from America, telling me to resign.
[2:59:35.400 --> 2:59:39.280]  I came into teaching to help poor people
[2:59:39.280 --> 2:59:42.400]  and they got me a thank you.
[2:59:42.400 --> 2:59:44.240]  How much money have they spent on this life?
[2:59:44.240 --> 2:59:46.120]  Person after person's life destroyed,
[2:59:46.120 --> 2:59:48.120]  while the council, your local council,
[2:59:48.120 --> 2:59:49.600]  give away hundreds of thousands of pounds
[2:59:49.600 --> 2:59:51.840]  to make sure that the truth can never be told.
[2:59:51.840 --> 2:59:53.880]  That's my mum's f***ing news.
[2:59:53.880 --> 2:59:56.240]  48 hours ago, I'm in a country,
[2:59:56.240 --> 2:59:57.840]  doxxed, they're addressed.
[2:59:57.840 --> 2:59:59.360]  You don't need to be scared.
[2:59:59.360 --> 3:00:01.360]  Because they're purposely just doing that.
[3:00:01.360 --> 3:00:02.840]  I don't know what I'm talking about.
[3:00:02.840 --> 3:00:03.680]  I don't know.
[3:00:03.680 --> 3:00:04.920]  They're doing that where we live.
[3:00:06.240 --> 3:00:07.400]  No, I mean...
[3:00:11.840 --> 3:00:15.080]  Oh, by the way, Tommy, I am gonna meet your kids, mate.
[3:00:21.800 --> 3:00:23.280]  All right, so...
[3:00:24.520 --> 3:00:26.280]  It's silence at InfoWars Film,
[3:00:26.280 --> 3:00:28.320]  presented by Tommy Robinson, coming soon.
[3:00:28.320 --> 3:00:29.480]  Tommy, we barely talked.
[3:00:29.480 --> 3:00:30.440]  You couldn't talk this morning,
[3:00:30.440 --> 3:00:31.960]  you said you're going to court, you talked to me later.
[3:00:31.960 --> 3:00:34.000]  I don't know what's happened since then.
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:35.040]  What's going on with the film?
[3:00:35.040 --> 3:00:36.560]  What happened in court today?
[3:00:37.880 --> 3:00:39.720]  That's what I've been trying to tell you, Alex.
[3:00:39.720 --> 3:00:42.720]  So, crazily, I'll ask you,
[3:00:42.720 --> 3:00:45.080]  I'll probably need you to delete that promo.
[3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:50.160]  We can have a discussion off there about where we go,
[3:00:50.160 --> 3:00:51.560]  what we do with the film.
[3:00:51.560 --> 3:00:52.400]  I don't think...
[3:00:52.400 --> 3:00:55.840]  Well, I'm sorry, but we haven't talked in weeks.
[3:00:55.840 --> 3:00:58.000]  I mean, the trailer, that was supposed to be...
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:00:59.480]  So, we need to take that down?
[3:01:01.280 --> 3:01:02.840]  Judging by the injunction,
[3:01:02.840 --> 3:01:05.280]  I've been served with an injunction today.
[3:01:05.280 --> 3:01:07.480]  Now, it's your film, it's your footage,
[3:01:07.480 --> 3:01:10.200]  it's produced for you, but we do have to have a serious talk.
[3:01:10.200 --> 3:01:11.200]  I mean, I haven't talked since...
[3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:12.720]  Okay, so I didn't know this happened.
[3:01:12.720 --> 3:01:14.120]  You were just telling me you were going to court today.
[3:01:14.120 --> 3:01:15.320]  What's happened?
[3:01:15.320 --> 3:01:16.240]  We'll take it down if you want,
[3:01:16.240 --> 3:01:19.080]  but we're not allowed to show the trailer for the film?
[3:01:20.280 --> 3:01:24.960]  I have an injunction that prevents me from...
[3:01:24.960 --> 3:01:27.360]  There's so much I can't say.
[3:01:27.360 --> 3:01:29.720]  So, basically, with this case...
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:32.960]  With this case, so everyone understands what's going on.
[3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:35.760]  I went and wore a hidden camera, okay?
[3:01:35.760 --> 3:01:38.000]  And I approached school members and staff.
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:40.240]  And I had the head teacher of the school,
[3:01:40.240 --> 3:01:42.120]  I had the head of the isolation unit,
[3:01:42.120 --> 3:01:44.560]  I had dinner ladies, I had office workers,
[3:01:44.560 --> 3:01:46.040]  I had all of them.
[3:01:46.040 --> 3:01:49.720]  All of them telling, openly on camera,
[3:01:49.720 --> 3:01:53.280]  totally corroborating the version of events
[3:01:53.280 --> 3:01:56.080]  that I had discussed.
[3:01:56.080 --> 3:02:01.080]  I'm not allowed to re-say any of what's been said
[3:02:01.200 --> 3:02:02.520]  by the people.
[3:02:02.520 --> 3:02:03.360]  For folks that don't know,
[3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:08.360]  they had a reported Muslim from Syria in school,
[3:02:08.600 --> 3:02:10.080]  beating people up.
[3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:12.200]  They demonized the kids that fought back.
[3:02:12.200 --> 3:02:13.480]  You did a story on it.
[3:02:13.480 --> 3:02:15.160]  You just lost a liable case that you said
[3:02:15.160 --> 3:02:16.200]  was going to be rigged.
[3:02:16.200 --> 3:02:17.720]  I knew months ago you talked about it.
[3:02:17.720 --> 3:02:19.200]  I saw you on the news.
[3:02:19.200 --> 3:02:20.440]  And so now they're saying,
[3:02:20.440 --> 3:02:22.280]  wait, you can't even put out a film,
[3:02:22.280 --> 3:02:23.720]  documenting that you told the truth.
[3:02:23.720 --> 3:02:24.960]  Wow.
[3:02:24.960 --> 3:02:27.000]  So basically what I'd done is I went
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:29.200]  and I interviewed people and I wore hidden footage
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:31.280]  and I got all these different people talking
[3:02:31.280 --> 3:02:32.120]  about what had happened.
[3:02:32.120 --> 3:02:34.560]  And Alex, the craziest part of this film,
[3:02:34.560 --> 3:02:36.720]  I don't think you had a chance to watch the entire,
[3:02:36.720 --> 3:02:39.160]  you've got it, but I'll judge him by what you said there.
[3:02:39.160 --> 3:02:40.000]  On this film.
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:41.400]  No, I mean, I'll be honest, we're fun in a lot of films.
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:42.520]  I know it's been in for a few weeks.
[3:02:42.520 --> 3:02:44.720]  I haven't watched it because I was just waiting for you to,
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:46.880]  okay, so yeah, tell me.
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:50.800]  Where it's, basically, when this story blew up,
[3:02:50.800 --> 3:02:52.480]  the story blew up that there was a horrible
[3:02:52.480 --> 3:02:54.440]  racist white English bully
[3:02:54.440 --> 3:02:56.640]  and there was a poor victim Syrian refugee.
[3:02:56.640 --> 3:02:58.640]  And that story was made into global news.
[3:02:58.640 --> 3:02:59.840]  It was taken to CNN.
[3:02:59.840 --> 3:03:01.640]  It was taken all over.
[3:03:01.640 --> 3:03:04.080]  Every politician, celebrity stars,
[3:03:04.080 --> 3:03:05.920]  they all pushed this story in this narrative.
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:07.120]  It's like Carl Rittenhouse.
[3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:09.680]  The ultimate evil is fighting back.
[3:03:09.680 --> 3:03:12.520]  We were told that, because the Syrian boy
[3:03:12.520 --> 3:03:14.080]  had his arm in plaster cast
[3:03:14.080 --> 3:03:16.640]  and we were told that was done in an incident
[3:03:16.640 --> 3:03:17.960]  of racist bullying, yeah?
[3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:19.840]  That's what we were told by the media.
[3:03:19.840 --> 3:03:23.600]  Now, I was contacted by parents and I saw online
[3:03:23.600 --> 3:03:25.920]  one young girl makes serious allegations
[3:03:25.920 --> 3:03:29.080]  and another young girl's mum makes serious allegations.
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:30.480]  So I simply contacted them.
[3:03:30.480 --> 3:03:32.160]  This is before my involvement.
[3:03:32.160 --> 3:03:34.960]  Then I saw that one girl deleted them
[3:03:34.960 --> 3:03:37.080]  and another woman put out a retraction.
[3:03:37.080 --> 3:03:39.800]  So when I went and wore undercover footage,
[3:03:39.800 --> 3:03:42.040]  the mother that done the retraction,
[3:03:42.040 --> 3:03:43.800]  I got on camera saying,
[3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:45.360]  Tommy, I only retracted it
[3:03:45.360 --> 3:03:47.120]  because they threatened to rape me.
[3:03:47.120 --> 3:03:48.680]  We have to live here, yeah?
[3:03:48.680 --> 3:03:50.720]  So that's why she retracted her story.
[3:03:50.720 --> 3:03:52.760]  The other little girl said she was terrified,
[3:03:52.760 --> 3:03:53.720]  she was worried.
[3:03:53.720 --> 3:03:55.440]  Now, the scary part of this
[3:03:55.440 --> 3:03:58.240]  is that why this was blowing up onto the world's news.
[3:03:58.240 --> 3:04:00.240]  The reality of all of the school records,
[3:04:00.240 --> 3:04:01.640]  of all of the witness statements,
[3:04:01.640 --> 3:04:03.000]  of all of the emails,
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:04.680]  they prove a totally different story
[3:04:04.680 --> 3:04:06.600]  and they prove that the school knew the truth.
[3:04:06.600 --> 3:04:08.120]  They prove the police knew the truth.
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:10.440]  They prove everyone knew the truth.
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:11.920]  And I sat there thinking,
[3:04:11.920 --> 3:04:14.560]  why is no one defending this other English child?
[3:04:14.560 --> 3:04:17.960]  Why is no one speaking the reality of the situation here?
[3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:19.920]  And when I went with my undercover cameras,
[3:04:19.920 --> 3:04:22.040]  I went to one Asian teacher and he said,
[3:04:22.040 --> 3:04:24.080]  Tommy, I've took the money.
[3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:26.040]  I have all of this on camera.
[3:04:26.040 --> 3:04:28.080]  I said, what do you mean you've took the money?
[3:04:28.080 --> 3:04:30.080]  He goes, they paid me.
[3:04:30.080 --> 3:04:31.600]  I said, who paid you?
[3:04:31.600 --> 3:04:33.160]  Kirk Lee's council.
[3:04:33.160 --> 3:04:36.200]  That is the local council government for that area.
[3:04:36.200 --> 3:04:38.480]  I said, what did they pay you for?
[3:04:38.480 --> 3:04:40.240]  He said, I've signed a non-disclosure agreement.
[3:04:40.240 --> 3:04:42.400]  I'm not allowed to talk about it.
[3:04:42.400 --> 3:04:44.000]  I said, how much they pay you?
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:45.920]  18,000 pounds.
[3:04:45.920 --> 3:04:47.560]  Then I have the head teacher
[3:04:47.560 --> 3:04:48.880]  and this is all documented.
[3:04:48.880 --> 3:04:50.600]  Then I have the head teacher.
[3:04:50.600 --> 3:04:52.200]  But the only problem is,
[3:04:52.200 --> 3:04:53.840]  I'm now under an injunction.
[3:04:53.840 --> 3:04:56.720]  I can't show everyone the evidence that I have
[3:04:56.720 --> 3:04:58.080]  that totally proves the corruption.
[3:04:58.080 --> 3:04:59.360]  Okay, well, listen, we're out of time.
[3:04:59.360 --> 3:05:00.760]  You've got to come back on tomorrow.
[3:05:00.760 --> 3:05:02.040]  I got to talk to you once this over
[3:05:02.040 --> 3:05:04.280]  because Mike Adams is coming up.
[3:05:04.280 --> 3:05:05.440]  I know it's a libel case.
[3:05:05.440 --> 3:05:06.480]  I know they claim he lost it.
[3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:08.360]  I know you've got to prove that's bull.
[3:05:08.360 --> 3:05:09.920]  They don't want you to put out the film
[3:05:09.920 --> 3:05:12.760]  showing this is a setup to say that Muslims are perfect,
[3:05:12.760 --> 3:05:14.040]  British are bad.
[3:05:14.040 --> 3:05:15.200]  I mean, I get that.
[3:05:15.200 --> 3:05:17.680]  I saw the news, it was a setup.
[3:05:17.680 --> 3:05:19.560]  And so I'm wondering where you've been for a year.
[3:05:19.560 --> 3:05:21.440]  It's good to have you back.
[3:05:21.440 --> 3:05:22.280]  God bless you.
[3:05:22.280 --> 3:05:23.120]  How do people find you?
[3:05:23.120 --> 3:05:24.880]  TR.NEWS.
[3:05:24.880 --> 3:05:26.280]  See at the minute,
[3:05:26.280 --> 3:05:27.480]  and the minute just on telegram.
[3:05:27.480 --> 3:05:29.000]  Tommy Robinson news on telegram
[3:05:29.000 --> 3:05:31.840]  is where our politics has shade.
[3:05:31.840 --> 3:05:32.760]  Well, actually, we have that.
[3:05:32.760 --> 3:05:34.880]  Tommy Robinson, we got Mike Adams coming up.
[3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:36.040]  He doesn't mind.
[3:05:36.040 --> 3:05:38.640]  You'll do two more minutes on the other side to finish up.
[3:05:41.920 --> 3:05:43.560]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome.
[3:05:43.560 --> 3:05:44.400]  Go ahead.
[3:05:44.400 --> 3:05:45.240]  How's it going, Alex?
[3:05:45.240 --> 3:05:46.080]  Good, bro.
[3:05:46.080 --> 3:05:46.920]  Great last caller.
[3:05:46.920 --> 3:05:50.080]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[3:05:50.080 --> 3:05:52.640]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore
[3:05:52.640 --> 3:05:55.880]  with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity.
[3:05:55.880 --> 3:05:57.720]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[3:05:57.720 --> 3:05:59.440]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[3:05:59.440 --> 3:06:00.440]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[3:06:00.440 --> 3:06:01.280]  Go ahead.
[3:06:01.280 --> 3:06:02.320]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[3:06:02.320 --> 3:06:04.120]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[3:06:04.120 --> 3:06:05.360]  for one of the product.
[3:06:05.360 --> 3:06:07.000]  The XQ does wonders.
[3:06:07.000 --> 3:06:09.320]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[3:06:09.320 --> 3:06:10.160]  Get off the fence.
[3:06:10.160 --> 3:06:11.040]  Get the product.
[3:06:11.040 --> 3:06:12.240]  Support the M4.
[3:06:12.240 --> 3:06:14.120]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air.
[3:06:14.120 --> 3:06:14.680]  Thanks for rolling.
[3:06:14.680 --> 3:06:15.160]  Go ahead.
[3:06:15.160 --> 3:06:16.840]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[3:06:16.840 --> 3:06:17.560]  It's an honor.
[3:06:17.560 --> 3:06:18.320]  Honored talk to you.
[3:06:18.320 --> 3:06:19.440]  Awesome.
[3:06:19.440 --> 3:06:21.760]  So first thing I wanted to do was say,
[3:06:21.760 --> 3:06:23.040]  I love the product.
[3:06:23.040 --> 3:06:26.600]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half,
[3:06:26.600 --> 3:06:29.000]  she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom.
[3:06:29.000 --> 3:06:30.720]  So just number one for a few of you.
[3:06:30.720 --> 3:06:31.680]  Well, it definitely works.
[3:06:31.680 --> 3:06:33.200]  It's not a joke, yeah.
[3:06:33.200 --> 3:06:34.200]  Absolutely.
[3:06:38.680 --> 3:06:40.240]  As we predicted, the globalists
[3:06:40.240 --> 3:06:42.480]  are now launching a new lockdown.
[3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:44.920]  The first one has already destroyed the third world,
[3:06:44.920 --> 3:06:46.920]  already caused over 20 million extra people
[3:06:46.920 --> 3:06:49.560]  to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain
[3:06:49.560 --> 3:06:51.960]  problems across the Western world.
[3:06:51.960 --> 3:06:53.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time
[3:06:53.560 --> 3:06:55.520]  for you to get high-quality, storeable food that's
[3:06:55.520 --> 3:06:58.760]  ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.
[3:06:58.760 --> 3:07:01.240]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States
[3:07:01.240 --> 3:07:02.200]  as our supplier.
[3:07:02.200 --> 3:07:04.640]  Their entire catalog is at infoworkstore.com.
[3:07:04.640 --> 3:07:07.800]  You get an additional 10% off at infoworkstore.com,
[3:07:07.800 --> 3:07:09.920]  but only for one more week.
[3:07:09.920 --> 3:07:12.360]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[3:07:12.360 --> 3:07:13.400]  But that's it.
[3:07:13.400 --> 3:07:15.800]  They won't do this sale again until November,
[3:07:15.800 --> 3:07:18.520]  and then the food prices go up in 2022.
[3:07:18.520 --> 3:07:19.960]  This is insurance you can eat.
[3:07:19.960 --> 3:07:22.480]  It's the highest quality, hundreds of high-quality foods,
[3:07:22.480 --> 3:07:24.080]  three months, six months, your supplies,
[3:07:24.080 --> 3:07:27.640]  all ready for you at infoworkstore.com or call toll free,
[3:07:27.640 --> 3:07:30.520]  triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[3:07:30.520 --> 3:07:33.440]  Again, infoworkstore.com, 10% off on high-quality,
[3:07:33.440 --> 3:07:36.760]  storeable food, ready to ship, but it ends in just one week.
[3:07:36.760 --> 3:07:38.600]  So take action now while you still can.
[3:07:38.600 --> 3:07:41.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:08.600 --> 3:08:10.240]  And I'm just here on air him saying,
[3:08:10.240 --> 3:08:14.360]  delete the trailer off of Band-Aid video
[3:08:14.360 --> 3:08:18.560]  and that he's been ordered, it's in the BBC News,
[3:08:18.560 --> 3:08:22.520]  to not talk about the Muslims who are as pure
[3:08:22.520 --> 3:08:25.400]  as the driven snow and perfect angel cakes.
[3:08:25.400 --> 3:08:26.560]  So I haven't seen the film.
[3:08:26.560 --> 3:08:27.400]  I don't know what's in it.
[3:08:27.400 --> 3:08:30.200]  I know we've got a copy of it, because we financed it.
[3:08:30.200 --> 3:08:32.160]  We just financed a big film about the boats
[3:08:32.160 --> 3:08:35.920]  coming across too from France with National Fall.
[3:08:35.920 --> 3:08:37.480]  So Tommy, just in closing, you're coming back
[3:08:37.480 --> 3:08:39.320]  tomorrow at noon to give us updates.
[3:08:39.320 --> 3:08:41.160]  I can talk to you off air, because I don't want
[3:08:41.160 --> 3:08:42.360]  to sound half cocked.
[3:08:42.360 --> 3:08:44.400]  This is all happening live on air right now.
[3:08:44.400 --> 3:08:47.640]  You made a film to challenge what they claimed you were wrong.
[3:08:47.640 --> 3:08:49.280]  They're saying you can't put that out now,
[3:08:49.280 --> 3:08:51.120]  or what's happening?
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:53.840]  Alex, I sat today and I filmed myself getting the verdict,
[3:08:53.840 --> 3:08:55.720]  because I've done it by a video link.
[3:08:55.720 --> 3:08:58.240]  And when I got the verdict that I lost,
[3:08:58.240 --> 3:09:01.840]  people would be surprised, but I was like, get in there, yeah?
[3:09:01.840 --> 3:09:05.960]  For the reason that the film proves
[3:09:05.960 --> 3:09:07.120]  the corruption of the media.
[3:09:07.120 --> 3:09:07.880]  It proves it.
[3:09:07.880 --> 3:09:09.080]  They were told the truth.
[3:09:09.080 --> 3:09:11.600]  I have recordings of the chair of governors telling us
[3:09:11.600 --> 3:09:12.480]  they sat with journalists.
[3:09:12.480 --> 3:09:13.640]  They told them the truth.
[3:09:13.640 --> 3:09:15.040]  It was hidden.
[3:09:15.040 --> 3:09:17.000]  So it proves the corruption.
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:19.880]  I have the proof of the corruption of the local council
[3:09:19.880 --> 3:09:22.120]  who were paying all the teachers to remain silent
[3:09:22.120 --> 3:09:23.360]  and not to tell the truth.
[3:09:23.360 --> 3:09:25.400]  I have all the recordings of the head teacher
[3:09:25.400 --> 3:09:26.960]  downward saying that, yeah?
[3:09:26.960 --> 3:09:27.760]  But I know the corruption.
[3:09:27.760 --> 3:09:31.680]  A big international story, kind of like we saw with the Catholic
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:34.400]  kids at the Capitol, and they said they were attacking people.
[3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:35.440]  It wasn't true.
[3:09:35.440 --> 3:09:38.040]  This is basically a similar story where people are being
[3:09:38.040 --> 3:09:38.440]  attacked.
[3:09:38.440 --> 3:09:39.520]  They fight back.
[3:09:39.520 --> 3:09:41.120]  They're being demonized.
[3:09:41.120 --> 3:09:43.960]  And so now they don't want you putting this film out.
[3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:45.480]  And they don't want the film going out,
[3:09:45.480 --> 3:09:49.760]  but this would then prove what is the unholy alliance.
[3:09:49.760 --> 3:09:51.440]  It is the alliance of the media.
[3:09:51.440 --> 3:09:53.000]  It's the alliance of the politicians.
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:55.240]  It's the alliance of our judicial systems.
[3:09:55.240 --> 3:09:58.040]  And all of it, working together hand in hand,
[3:09:58.040 --> 3:10:02.520]  along with corrupt lawyers and far left extremists,
[3:10:02.520 --> 3:10:07.720]  because this film shows a campaign of hate, intimidation,
[3:10:07.720 --> 3:10:08.440]  against everyone.
[3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:10.040]  It's the reason it was called Silence,
[3:10:10.040 --> 3:10:12.800]  because everyone from start to finish have been silent.
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:15.880]  And I sit here now with a perfect name for the film,
[3:10:15.880 --> 3:10:18.400]  because I've been silent, because I've got a gag in order.
[3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:21.320]  I've got a gag in order that I can't have anything to do with the film
[3:10:21.320 --> 3:10:21.720]  that you have.
[3:10:21.720 --> 3:10:22.920]  OK, well, let me just say this.
[3:10:22.920 --> 3:10:23.920]  We have the film.
[3:10:23.920 --> 3:10:25.920]  I'm going to go watch it after the show.
[3:10:25.920 --> 3:10:27.360]  And Tommy, I pay for the film.
[3:10:27.360 --> 3:10:29.040]  So I'm going to make the decision whether I'm
[3:10:29.040 --> 3:10:30.520]  going to put the film out or not.
[3:10:30.520 --> 3:10:32.320]  But the trailer is going to stay up.
[3:10:32.320 --> 3:10:34.000]  I'm not the Soviet Union yet.
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:37.960]  My answer just didn't die for freedom in fight Hitler
[3:10:37.960 --> 3:10:39.080]  to live like this.
[3:10:39.080 --> 3:10:42.120]  Silence, that info or film presented by Tommy Robinson,
[3:10:42.120 --> 3:10:43.240]  stays up.
[3:10:43.240 --> 3:10:46.320]  I don't care what the Islamists and all their armies say.
[3:10:46.320 --> 3:10:48.040]  So the trailer stays up.
[3:10:48.040 --> 3:10:49.360]  I hope it goes viral now.
[3:10:49.360 --> 3:10:52.360]  And I hope it gets out there, because we need freedom
[3:10:52.360 --> 3:10:53.680]  to speak now more than ever.
[3:10:53.680 --> 3:10:58.000]  Join me tomorrow at noon to give us the latest
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  and have time to flesh all this out.
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:01.760]  But Tommy, you've been gone for a year.
[3:11:01.760 --> 3:11:04.280]  I know they've attacked your house, attacked your family,
[3:11:04.280 --> 3:11:05.040]  attacked your wife.
[3:11:05.040 --> 3:11:07.000]  I know it's been rough, but you're ready to speak.
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:09.040]  So we'll talk about where Tommy Robinson's
[3:11:09.040 --> 3:11:11.560]  been tomorrow in like 21 hours.
[3:11:11.560 --> 3:11:12.840]  OK?
[3:11:12.840 --> 3:11:13.840]  OK, sound Alex.
[3:11:13.840 --> 3:11:14.840]  We'll talk off there as well.
[3:11:14.840 --> 3:11:15.920]  Yeah, I'll call you.
[3:11:15.920 --> 3:11:18.400]  I'll call you right after this. OK?
[3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:18.920]  Thanks.
[3:11:18.920 --> 3:11:20.720]  Haven't talked to him since before court.
[3:11:20.720 --> 3:11:22.320]  All right.
[3:11:22.320 --> 3:11:22.920]  There you go.
[3:11:22.920 --> 3:11:24.960]  The fight for freedom continues.
[3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:26.760]  The fight for free speech continues.
[3:11:26.760 --> 3:11:28.760]  Those that don't want you to be able to make your own decision,
[3:11:28.760 --> 3:11:29.840]  they're your enemy.
[3:11:29.840 --> 3:11:34.240]  Mike Adams, naturalnews.com takes over.
[3:11:34.240 --> 3:11:34.840]  All right, Alex.
[3:11:34.840 --> 3:11:40.040]  Well, and by the way, I don't mind at all being delayed.
[3:11:40.040 --> 3:11:42.080]  What Tommy Robinson is doing is so critical,
[3:11:42.080 --> 3:11:44.320]  super important for our world.
[3:11:44.320 --> 3:11:47.280]  And that sounds like it's the most important story happening
[3:11:47.280 --> 3:11:49.440]  right now, so I'm glad you're on it.
[3:11:49.440 --> 3:11:54.720]  And I would just say to people, multiple platforms,
[3:11:54.720 --> 3:11:57.960]  take that trailer and post it to different platforms,
[3:11:57.960 --> 3:12:00.040]  including Brighttown, Bitshoot, and Rumble,
[3:12:00.040 --> 3:12:01.720]  and everywhere that you can.
[3:12:01.720 --> 3:12:03.320]  And we'll respect it.
[3:12:03.320 --> 3:12:06.000]  If Infowars wants us to take that down,
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:07.040]  we would respect that.
[3:12:07.040 --> 3:12:09.280]  But until then, let's get the word out.
[3:12:09.280 --> 3:12:12.280]  Let's help Tommy Robinson have a voice,
[3:12:12.280 --> 3:12:14.680]  because he's being gagged in silence as he's talking about.
[3:12:14.680 --> 3:12:16.160]  He's a very courageous individual.
[3:12:16.160 --> 3:12:18.400]  He has a crucial message for freedom.
[3:12:18.400 --> 3:12:20.480]  And God bless him.
[3:12:20.480 --> 3:12:21.120]  God bless him.
[3:12:21.120 --> 3:12:23.640]  Prayers to Tommy Robinson for his safety and his work,
[3:12:23.640 --> 3:12:26.600]  because he's kind of like, it sounds like for this project,
[3:12:26.600 --> 3:12:31.800]  he's doing the project Veritas version of this in the UK.
[3:12:31.800 --> 3:12:34.880]  And the UK is such a police state.
[3:12:34.880 --> 3:12:38.760]  The speech police and the vaccine passport police,
[3:12:38.760 --> 3:12:40.040]  it's so out of control.
[3:12:40.040 --> 3:12:41.080]  It's so tyrannical.
[3:12:41.080 --> 3:12:45.760]  And I feel so sorry for the people in the UK
[3:12:45.760 --> 3:12:49.000]  who are trying to retain their freedom.
[3:12:49.000 --> 3:12:52.360]  And I also feel blessed for what we have in places like Texas,
[3:12:52.360 --> 3:12:55.200]  where we have so much more freedom,
[3:12:55.200 --> 3:12:59.080]  because we're in a red state, a red county, in a red state.
[3:12:59.080 --> 3:13:02.240]  And we've got the Bill of Rights, the Constitution,
[3:13:02.240 --> 3:13:04.560]  that still has elements remaining that haven't yet
[3:13:04.560 --> 3:13:07.200]  been completely destroyed by the Biden regime, which
[3:13:07.200 --> 3:13:08.600]  I know they're working on.
[3:13:08.600 --> 3:13:11.240]  But we still have the freedom to speak right here
[3:13:11.240 --> 3:13:14.520]  on this show, on this platform, infowars.com.
[3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:17.320]  And by God, we're going to exercise that freedom
[3:13:17.320 --> 3:13:18.800]  in the name of humanity.
[3:13:18.800 --> 3:13:20.040]  And that's what this is about.
[3:13:20.040 --> 3:13:23.320]  So just a note to the producers there and for Alex,
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:25.960]  if there's something else breaking, obviously,
[3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:28.240]  you could just jump in and go.
[3:13:28.240 --> 3:13:30.160]  I mean, it's your platform, it's your show.
[3:13:30.160 --> 3:13:32.520]  Until then, I'm going to bring you the information
[3:13:32.520 --> 3:13:34.400]  that I had planned for this segment.
[3:13:34.400 --> 3:13:37.240]  And maybe it'll get interrupted, and that's totally fine,
[3:13:37.240 --> 3:13:38.280]  because this is reality.
[3:13:38.280 --> 3:13:39.600]  Reality is dynamic.
[3:13:39.600 --> 3:13:41.080]  We have to react to events.
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:45.200]  And again, God bless Tommy Robinson and his work.
[3:13:45.200 --> 3:13:48.400]  What I've got for you coming up today, let's see, really,
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:52.840]  in just a few minutes here, I've got a guest coming on,
[3:13:52.840 --> 3:13:57.760]  Bob Griswold, who is an expert in, well, so many things that
[3:13:57.760 --> 3:14:00.400]  have been happening around the world.
[3:14:00.400 --> 3:14:04.600]  And we're going to talk about the multi-layered collapse
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:08.680]  that's taking place and what you can do to help defend yourself
[3:14:08.680 --> 3:14:10.960]  against that collapse.
[3:14:10.960 --> 3:14:13.560]  And you've got to understand there's
[3:14:13.560 --> 3:14:17.000]  a desperation on the part of the globalists.
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:22.120]  And the desperation is that they know that things are turning.
[3:14:22.120 --> 3:14:23.400]  There's an awakening.
[3:14:23.400 --> 3:14:24.480]  There's awareness now.
[3:14:24.480 --> 3:14:25.720]  Things are really turning.
[3:14:25.720 --> 3:14:28.280]  And by the way, I don't see the clock.
[3:14:28.280 --> 3:14:30.040]  So just let me know when we're going to break.
[3:14:30.040 --> 3:14:31.840]  But things are turning.
[3:14:31.840 --> 3:14:33.920]  And because of that, the globalists
[3:14:33.920 --> 3:14:36.640]  are extremely desperate to cover their tracks, which
[3:14:36.640 --> 3:14:40.800]  means they're going to release as many terrorism events
[3:14:40.800 --> 3:14:43.160]  against humanity as they can manage.
[3:14:43.160 --> 3:14:45.880]  There are financial terrorism events
[3:14:45.880 --> 3:14:46.920]  that they are engineering.
[3:14:46.920 --> 3:14:49.720]  There's food scarcity that they are engineering.
[3:14:49.720 --> 3:14:52.600]  There's probably a grid down scenario, at least regionally,
[3:14:52.600 --> 3:14:53.840]  that's being planned.
[3:14:53.840 --> 3:14:56.080]  And many other scenarios, maybe World War
[3:14:56.080 --> 3:14:59.840]  III, maybe UN occupation of America at some point,
[3:14:59.840 --> 3:15:02.240]  they're planning so many things, more bioweapons,
[3:15:02.240 --> 3:15:08.120]  more vaccines containing a nanotech weaponized systems
[3:15:08.120 --> 3:15:11.560]  to exterminate as many human beings as they can.
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:14.040]  So they know they're going to get caught.
[3:15:14.040 --> 3:15:15.520]  And that's the good news in all of this.
[3:15:15.520 --> 3:15:18.280]  They know they're going down eventually.
[3:15:18.280 --> 3:15:20.200]  But the bad news is they're going to unleash
[3:15:20.200 --> 3:15:22.680]  every form of terrorism against humanity between now
[3:15:22.680 --> 3:15:25.240]  and then in order to try to cover their tracks.
[3:15:25.240 --> 3:15:28.680]  So we are living through the best of times and the worst
[3:15:28.680 --> 3:15:30.800]  of times, as the novel says.
[3:15:30.800 --> 3:15:33.840]  Things are going to be as bad or worse
[3:15:33.840 --> 3:15:36.000]  as anything you've ever experienced in your life.
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:38.360]  But if we survive that, then we earn the right
[3:15:38.360 --> 3:15:43.480]  to be here to witness what happens on the other side of this.
[3:15:43.480 --> 3:15:44.880]  And on the other side of this, we're
[3:15:44.880 --> 3:15:48.640]  going to see the indictment and the imprisoning
[3:15:48.640 --> 3:15:50.840]  of these criminals against humanity
[3:15:50.840 --> 3:15:54.800]  who are demonic, demon-possessed criminals
[3:15:54.800 --> 3:15:57.040]  and destroyers of worlds that try
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:15:58.160]  to destroy our civilization.
[3:15:58.160 --> 3:15:59.560]  They're going down.
[3:15:59.560 --> 3:16:01.240]  They're going down.
[3:16:01.240 --> 3:16:02.200]  Humanity wins.
[3:16:02.200 --> 3:16:02.880]  God wins.
[3:16:02.880 --> 3:16:04.400]  We win in the end.
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:07.520]  But there are tribulations between here and there
[3:16:07.520 --> 3:16:08.880]  that we've got to get through.
[3:16:08.880 --> 3:16:10.800]  So coming up after this break, we're
[3:16:10.800 --> 3:16:12.280]  going to have Bob Griswold joining us
[3:16:12.280 --> 3:16:16.000]  talk about how we prepare ourselves for that survival,
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:19.800]  how we get through all of this, and what knowledge, wisdom,
[3:16:19.800 --> 3:16:22.040]  and maybe some tools that we need to make it
[3:16:22.040 --> 3:16:22.880]  through all of that.
[3:16:22.880 --> 3:16:24.840]  I'm Mike Adams here on infowars.com.
[3:16:24.840 --> 3:16:25.560]  Stay with us.
[3:16:25.560 --> 3:16:27.920]  We'll be right back after this break with that interview
[3:16:27.920 --> 3:16:28.720]  with Bob Griswold.
[3:16:28.720 --> 3:16:41.920]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that
[3:16:41.920 --> 3:16:45.960]  criminologists all agree on, and that its criminals are
[3:16:45.960 --> 3:16:49.280]  extremely pathological, even more the general public.
[3:16:49.280 --> 3:16:51.560]  They do the same things over and over again.
[3:16:51.560 --> 3:16:54.840]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes
[3:16:54.840 --> 3:16:57.240]  over and over again.
[3:16:57.240 --> 3:16:58.800]  Well, guess what?
[3:16:58.800 --> 3:17:01.880]  It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist
[3:17:01.880 --> 3:17:06.240]  that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it
[3:17:06.240 --> 3:17:09.200]  with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people
[3:17:09.200 --> 3:17:09.960]  than HIV.
[3:17:09.960 --> 3:17:13.960]  And they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses
[3:17:13.960 --> 3:17:16.160]  that would actually go attack the teal infestates in the body
[3:17:16.160 --> 3:17:18.800]  and create autoimmune disorders.
[3:17:18.800 --> 3:17:22.760]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down
[3:17:22.760 --> 3:17:25.120]  and would be non-lethal down the road.
[3:17:25.120 --> 3:17:27.280]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19
[3:17:27.280 --> 3:17:30.280]  and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine
[3:17:30.280 --> 3:17:32.600]  destroys your immune system, basically giving you
[3:17:32.600 --> 3:17:34.440]  the equivalent of HIV.
[3:17:34.440 --> 3:17:36.840]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:17:36.840 --> 3:17:39.640]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long
[3:17:39.640 --> 3:17:42.600]  because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that
[3:17:42.600 --> 3:17:45.080]  are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[3:17:45.080 --> 3:17:47.440]  But because they have great cameras and great recording
[3:17:47.440 --> 3:17:49.200]  systems and great ways to communicate,
[3:17:49.200 --> 3:17:52.520]  I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean
[3:17:52.520 --> 3:17:53.880]  fire, has a lot of power.
[3:17:53.880 --> 3:17:56.200]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up
[3:17:56.200 --> 3:17:59.000]  in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket,
[3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:00.800]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:00.800 --> 3:18:03.480]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[3:18:03.480 --> 3:18:06.280]  They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones,
[3:18:06.280 --> 3:18:09.480]  and 50% off, $14.95.
[3:18:09.480 --> 3:18:12.800]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[3:18:12.800 --> 3:18:17.920]  We've got a private label with info wars on them for $14.95
[3:18:17.920 --> 3:18:20.040]  because I want you to get them and I
[3:18:20.040 --> 3:18:22.320]  want you to buy friends and family these systems
[3:18:22.320 --> 3:18:24.680]  to educate them about what these, quote,
[3:18:24.680 --> 3:18:26.160]  smartphones really are.
[3:18:26.160 --> 3:18:28.320]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[3:18:28.320 --> 3:18:30.240]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family,
[3:18:30.240 --> 3:18:32.040]  and it's a great way to know you're not
[3:18:32.040 --> 3:18:34.000]  being trapped by the criminal global system.
[3:18:34.000 --> 3:18:36.840]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:36.840 --> 3:18:38.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:39.840]  of the Info Wars War Room.
[3:18:39.840 --> 3:18:43.120]  And I am very excited about our latest supplement
[3:18:43.120 --> 3:18:45.360]  addition to infowarstore.com.
[3:18:45.360 --> 3:18:47.920]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers,
[3:18:47.920 --> 3:18:50.360]  and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[3:18:50.360 --> 3:18:53.600]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens
[3:18:53.600 --> 3:18:55.960]  fiber caps to infowarstore.com.
[3:18:55.960 --> 3:18:58.880]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[3:18:58.880 --> 3:19:00.000]  Listen to this.
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:03.480]  Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheat
[3:19:03.480 --> 3:19:07.040]  grass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf,
[3:19:07.040 --> 3:19:10.200]  organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[3:19:10.200 --> 3:19:12.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things
[3:19:12.320 --> 3:19:13.680]  are so incredible for your health.
[3:19:13.680 --> 3:19:15.360]  Just one of these ingredients can
[3:19:15.360 --> 3:19:17.520]  be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[3:19:17.520 --> 3:19:20.920]  And we've packed it all in to fibergreencaps
[3:19:20.920 --> 3:19:22.240]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:19:22.240 --> 3:19:26.120]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[3:19:26.120 --> 3:19:28.320]  I suggest that you do the same thing.
[3:19:28.320 --> 3:19:32.520]  And right now, it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[3:19:32.520 --> 3:19:35.440]  That's 33% off at infowarstore.com.
[3:19:35.440 --> 3:19:44.440]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:19:44.440 --> 3:19:49.440]  I was standing line for this.
[3:19:49.440 --> 3:19:54.440]  There's always room in life for this.
[3:19:54.440 --> 3:19:57.440]  Oh, babe.
[3:19:57.440 --> 3:19:59.440]  Oh, babe.
[3:19:59.440 --> 3:20:04.440]  All right, you're watching The Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:04.440 --> 3:20:05.440]  On infowarstore.com.
[3:20:05.440 --> 3:20:07.440]  I'm Mike Adams, filling in for the rest of this hour.
[3:20:07.440 --> 3:20:09.440]  And I've got a special guest for you
[3:20:09.440 --> 3:20:11.440]  that's going to bring some analysis and insight
[3:20:11.440 --> 3:20:15.440]  into the severity of the collapse and chaos situation
[3:20:15.440 --> 3:20:18.440]  we're now facing, because globalists are trying to distract
[3:20:18.440 --> 3:20:23.440]  us from their murderous crimes of building biological weapons
[3:20:23.440 --> 3:20:26.440]  and unleashing them against humanity in the form of COVID
[3:20:26.440 --> 3:20:30.440]  and also, of course, COVID vaccines, which are also
[3:20:30.440 --> 3:20:32.440]  weaponized to cause mass extermination.
[3:20:32.440 --> 3:20:35.440]  So we're going to have our work cut out for us
[3:20:35.440 --> 3:20:36.440]  to survive all of this.
[3:20:36.440 --> 3:20:38.440]  We're going to bring on now Bob Griswald
[3:20:38.440 --> 3:20:40.440]  from readymaderesources.com.
[3:20:40.440 --> 3:20:42.440]  And Bob is a trusted analyst.
[3:20:42.440 --> 3:20:44.440]  He's got a lot of important opinions and experience
[3:20:44.440 --> 3:20:47.440]  in these areas on an international scope.
[3:20:47.440 --> 3:20:49.440]  Bob, welcome to the show.
[3:20:49.440 --> 3:20:50.440]  It's great to have you on.
[3:20:50.440 --> 3:20:51.440]  How are you doing today?
[3:20:51.440 --> 3:20:52.440]  I'm doing well, Mike.
[3:20:52.440 --> 3:20:54.440]  Thank you so much for having me here.
[3:20:54.440 --> 3:20:55.440]  You know, even as you were talking,
[3:20:55.440 --> 3:20:57.440]  I'm looking at a news report right now.
[3:20:57.440 --> 3:21:00.440]  It says widespread internet outage.
[3:21:00.440 --> 3:21:04.440]  Brief disruptions of retail, financial travel websites down,
[3:21:04.440 --> 3:21:07.440]  DNS failure, fixed question mark.
[3:21:07.440 --> 3:21:10.440]  9-11 outages reported along East Coast.
[3:21:10.440 --> 3:21:12.440]  This isn't going to stop, Mike.
[3:21:12.440 --> 3:21:17.440]  And what my concern is this is that people read this, China,
[3:21:17.440 --> 3:21:21.440]  and what they're doing, the vaccine and what they're doing,
[3:21:21.440 --> 3:21:24.440]  the moral breakdown of society, what's happening there.
[3:21:24.440 --> 3:21:28.440]  And people can get so overwhelmed with what you would call
[3:21:28.440 --> 3:21:30.440]  raw intelligence.
[3:21:30.440 --> 3:21:32.440]  We read it every day.
[3:21:32.440 --> 3:21:34.440]  You and I read it every day.
[3:21:34.440 --> 3:21:37.440]  But at the end of the day, you have to take that raw intelligence
[3:21:37.440 --> 3:21:42.440]  and make a product out of it that suits you, that serves you.
[3:21:42.440 --> 3:21:44.440]  And that's the real trick in doing it,
[3:21:44.440 --> 3:21:46.440]  because we all see the same news,
[3:21:46.440 --> 3:21:49.440]  but a lot of people don't do anything.
[3:21:49.440 --> 3:21:51.440]  Some people do something.
[3:21:51.440 --> 3:21:53.440]  Some people do the wrong things.
[3:21:53.440 --> 3:21:57.440]  The real key is taking this information that we see every day,
[3:21:57.440 --> 3:21:59.440]  the moral breakdown, the vaccines,
[3:21:59.440 --> 3:22:02.440]  the pushing of more lockdowns coming on the United States,
[3:22:02.440 --> 3:22:06.440]  these shutdowns, these cyber-hackings that we see
[3:22:06.440 --> 3:22:08.440]  shutting down gasoline, meat, whatever.
[3:22:08.440 --> 3:22:10.440]  It goes all off the economy.
[3:22:10.440 --> 3:22:16.440]  This massive infusion of debt spending chasing fewer and fewer goods.
[3:22:16.440 --> 3:22:22.440]  So, you know, if you leave it there, people could get really confused.
[3:22:22.440 --> 3:22:25.440]  But Bob, let's talk about what you just said.
[3:22:25.440 --> 3:22:29.440]  Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader, just came out.
[3:22:29.440 --> 3:22:32.440]  I think it was this morning, or perhaps yesterday,
[3:22:32.440 --> 3:22:34.440]  but he said that if people don't get the shots,
[3:22:34.440 --> 3:22:36.440]  then we're going back into lockdowns.
[3:22:36.440 --> 3:22:38.440]  So, this is a GOP leader of the Senate.
[3:22:38.440 --> 3:22:41.440]  Basically, I mean, it sounds a lot like a threat, like,
[3:22:41.440 --> 3:22:45.440]  hey, you better get vaccinated, or we're going to punish you.
[3:22:45.440 --> 3:22:47.440]  We're going to make you a slave in your own home,
[3:22:47.440 --> 3:22:49.440]  or a prisoner in your own home,
[3:22:49.440 --> 3:22:52.440]  and then they're going to systematically destroy the economy
[3:22:52.440 --> 3:22:55.440]  with the universal basic income payments to these people
[3:22:55.440 --> 3:22:57.440]  to get the culture used to not working.
[3:22:57.440 --> 3:22:59.440]  But my question to you, I mean, you know all this,
[3:22:59.440 --> 3:23:05.440]  the listeners know all this, how bad are things going to get
[3:23:05.440 --> 3:23:08.440]  if they succeed in all their plans of all the lockdowns
[3:23:08.440 --> 3:23:10.440]  and the economic destruction?
[3:23:10.440 --> 3:23:13.440]  Because people don't know you've seen things overseas
[3:23:13.440 --> 3:23:16.440]  that would give people nightmares.
[3:23:16.440 --> 3:23:17.440]  You've seen collapse.
[3:23:17.440 --> 3:23:18.440]  What does it look like?
[3:23:18.440 --> 3:23:20.440]  What do you think is coming?
[3:23:20.440 --> 3:23:22.440]  Well, what it looks like is very unpleasant.
[3:23:22.440 --> 3:23:26.440]  People will sell things that they'd never even think they'd sell,
[3:23:26.440 --> 3:23:28.440]  including family members.
[3:23:28.440 --> 3:23:33.440]  Anything you have to put food on your table, people will do.
[3:23:33.440 --> 3:23:35.440]  I've seen it.
[3:23:35.440 --> 3:23:37.440]  It's very unpleasant to think about.
[3:23:37.440 --> 3:23:42.440]  It's, you know, when you have a mother offering you a young child
[3:23:42.440 --> 3:23:44.440]  for a certain amount of money,
[3:23:44.440 --> 3:23:48.440]  and you can basically do what that child is you want.
[3:23:48.440 --> 3:23:51.440]  Now, we think that offends our sensibilities so much
[3:23:51.440 --> 3:23:53.440]  that we would never do it here.
[3:23:53.440 --> 3:23:56.440]  But in this country today, millions of children have to sell
[3:23:56.440 --> 3:24:00.440]  themselves in one way or another just to meet basic necessities.
[3:24:00.440 --> 3:24:02.440]  We just try to put it out of sight.
[3:24:02.440 --> 3:24:05.440]  And this is what I was saying, Americans right now,
[3:24:05.440 --> 3:24:08.440]  those watching this program, watching your program
[3:24:08.440 --> 3:24:12.440]  and other people like that, need to take this information
[3:24:12.440 --> 3:24:16.440]  and decide how do I use this to benefit my family?
[3:24:16.440 --> 3:24:18.440]  Because that's the real thing.
[3:24:18.440 --> 3:24:23.440]  If you do not take this information now and do have a plan
[3:24:23.440 --> 3:24:27.440]  that's going to, you know, fit your family's needs,
[3:24:27.440 --> 3:24:30.440]  you are going to go the way that they want you to go.
[3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:33.440]  And that's to the slaughterhouse, you know, the death camp,
[3:24:33.440 --> 3:24:35.440]  whatever it will be.
[3:24:35.440 --> 3:24:38.440]  And like, you know, this isn't hyperbole anymore.
[3:24:38.440 --> 3:24:41.440]  This is what these people are saying, the Georgia guide stones.
[3:24:41.440 --> 3:24:44.440]  They want to eliminate billions of people off the planet.
[3:24:44.440 --> 3:24:47.440]  I mean, you know, when Adolf Hitler wrote Mein Kampf,
[3:24:47.440 --> 3:24:49.440]  if you believed it, you acted on it.
[3:24:49.440 --> 3:24:51.440]  If you just thought it was hyperbole
[3:24:51.440 --> 3:24:54.440]  and just the rentings of a madman, then you ignored it
[3:24:54.440 --> 3:24:58.440]  and you ended up probably in a death camp, you know,
[3:24:58.440 --> 3:25:01.440]  being gassed to death or worked to death.
[3:25:01.440 --> 3:25:03.440]  So that's the choice of Americans.
[3:25:03.440 --> 3:25:07.440]  Well, sorry to interrupt, but tens of millions of Americans
[3:25:07.440 --> 3:25:09.440]  are oblivious to what's happening.
[3:25:09.440 --> 3:25:12.440]  Mostly people on the left, they're taking the vaccine shots.
[3:25:12.440 --> 3:25:14.440]  They don't know that they're not really vaccines.
[3:25:14.440 --> 3:25:17.440]  It's gene therapy, you know, maybe transhumanism tech.
[3:25:17.440 --> 3:25:19.440]  It's hard to say exactly what the outcome is going to be.
[3:25:19.440 --> 3:25:22.440]  But they think the economy is going to get back to normal
[3:25:22.440 --> 3:25:24.440]  if just everybody would take the shot.
[3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:27.440]  They think that Biden is somehow good for America
[3:25:27.440 --> 3:25:29.440]  when he's allowing hundreds of thousands of illegals
[3:25:29.440 --> 3:25:32.440]  to invade the southern border every month now, month after month.
[3:25:32.440 --> 3:25:36.440]  I mean, they're living in an oblivious, fake reality.
[3:25:36.440 --> 3:25:37.440]  Bob, isn't it true?
[3:25:37.440 --> 3:25:41.440]  Their cities will collapse if this is allowed to continue.
[3:25:41.440 --> 3:25:43.440]  And their cities will become death traps.
[3:25:43.440 --> 3:25:45.440]  They will kill themselves.
[3:25:45.440 --> 3:25:47.440]  Yeah, their cities are collapsing.
[3:25:47.440 --> 3:25:51.440]  I mean, all you have to do is just look at history right now.
[3:25:51.440 --> 3:25:52.440]  History, what did Mark Twain say?
[3:25:52.440 --> 3:25:54.440]  It doesn't repeat, but it sure does rhyme.
[3:25:54.440 --> 3:25:58.440]  I mean, we are looking at just a massive infusion
[3:25:58.440 --> 3:26:02.440]  of fake money into this economy right now.
[3:26:02.440 --> 3:26:05.440]  Half the money in the economy right now was added
[3:26:05.440 --> 3:26:07.440]  within the last year.
[3:26:07.440 --> 3:26:08.440]  Think of that.
[3:26:08.440 --> 3:26:10.440]  Half of it that's floating around the economy
[3:26:10.440 --> 3:26:12.440]  was added in the last year.
[3:26:12.440 --> 3:26:14.440]  And at the same time on top of that,
[3:26:14.440 --> 3:26:18.440]  we've had a major disruption in shipping, trucking,
[3:26:18.440 --> 3:26:21.440]  and all of the manner of delivery of goods.
[3:26:21.440 --> 3:26:23.440]  I mean, right now, I have a desk right here
[3:26:23.440 --> 3:26:25.440]  that I have in my new office.
[3:26:25.440 --> 3:26:27.440]  It took me six months to get this desk.
[3:26:27.440 --> 3:26:29.440]  I ordered in it and they told me a month,
[3:26:29.440 --> 3:26:32.440]  but it's six months later, it finally showed up.
[3:26:32.440 --> 3:26:34.440]  That's what you're looking at.
[3:26:34.440 --> 3:26:36.440]  And so we have all this money right now
[3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:38.440]  chasing fewer and fewer goods.
[3:26:38.440 --> 3:26:40.440]  And that's how they're going to eliminate...
[3:26:40.440 --> 3:26:42.440]  You're exactly right, but let me jump in with a question.
[3:26:42.440 --> 3:26:44.440]  And I'm sorry to interrupt,
[3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:46.440]  but you might not be able to hear me
[3:26:46.440 --> 3:26:48.440]  because of the audio setup.
[3:26:48.440 --> 3:26:50.440]  So you're in a commercial business.
[3:26:50.440 --> 3:26:52.440]  I'm in a commercial business.
[3:26:52.440 --> 3:26:54.440]  Alex Jones is in a commercial business.
[3:26:54.440 --> 3:26:56.440]  All three of us see the same thing,
[3:26:56.440 --> 3:26:58.440]  and I want you to describe what are you seeing
[3:26:58.440 --> 3:27:00.440]  with commercial supply lines,
[3:27:00.440 --> 3:27:03.440]  because I'm seeing a collapse in commercial quantities of food.
[3:27:03.440 --> 3:27:06.440]  We buy millions of pounds of food a year and so on.
[3:27:06.440 --> 3:27:08.440]  It's collapsing.
[3:27:08.440 --> 3:27:10.440]  They're telling us they can't guarantee food after 90 days
[3:27:10.440 --> 3:27:12.440]  from July 1st, by the way.
[3:27:12.440 --> 3:27:14.440]  What are you seeing?
[3:27:14.440 --> 3:27:16.440]  Because you're in a different business,
[3:27:16.440 --> 3:27:18.440]  like night vision and stuff like that.
[3:27:18.440 --> 3:27:20.440]  What are you seeing?
[3:27:20.440 --> 3:27:22.440]  Chicken. That's one meat right now.
[3:27:22.440 --> 3:27:24.440]  That's becoming scarcer and scarcer.
[3:27:24.440 --> 3:27:26.440]  All you have to do is look at what the big companies
[3:27:26.440 --> 3:27:28.440]  are doing right now.
[3:27:28.440 --> 3:27:30.440]  Supermarkets are stocking up more than they normally do.
[3:27:30.440 --> 3:27:32.440]  Fast food restaurants,
[3:27:32.440 --> 3:27:34.440]  you see them stocking up extra food
[3:27:34.440 --> 3:27:36.440]  because they know a shortage is coming.
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:38.440]  We can ignore that.
[3:27:38.440 --> 3:27:40.440]  You can ignore that data point and say,
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:42.440]  well, it'll always be there because it's always been there.
[3:27:42.440 --> 3:27:44.440]  But what's going to happen
[3:27:44.440 --> 3:27:46.440]  when all of a sudden you don't have your vaccine passport?
[3:27:46.440 --> 3:27:48.440]  You don't have the money
[3:27:48.440 --> 3:27:50.440]  because all, you know,
[3:27:50.440 --> 3:27:52.440]  you're $10 that used to buy a pound of chicken.
[3:27:52.440 --> 3:27:54.440]  Now it's $50 and you can't buy it.
[3:27:54.440 --> 3:27:56.440]  All these things are coming into play.
[3:27:56.440 --> 3:27:58.440]  So the question is not really
[3:27:58.440 --> 3:28:00.440]  to just address the issues,
[3:28:00.440 --> 3:28:02.440]  but how do you fix it?
[3:28:02.440 --> 3:28:04.440]  And there's only one way to fix it right now.
[3:28:04.440 --> 3:28:06.440]  The money that you have realized
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:08.440]  that in six months it's going to be worth
[3:28:08.440 --> 3:28:10.440]  maybe half of what it's worth right now.
[3:28:10.440 --> 3:28:12.440]  And if you don't take that money
[3:28:12.440 --> 3:28:14.440]  and put it into goods and tangibles
[3:28:14.440 --> 3:28:16.440]  that your family needs in six months from now,
[3:28:16.440 --> 3:28:18.440]  instead of buying a pound of chicken,
[3:28:18.440 --> 3:28:20.440]  you'll buy a half a pound with the same amount of money.
[3:28:20.440 --> 3:28:22.440]  And also all of a sudden your savings
[3:28:22.440 --> 3:28:24.440]  and all that is depreciated
[3:28:24.440 --> 3:28:26.440]  and you'll be working harder and harder
[3:28:26.440 --> 3:28:28.440]  for less and less.
[3:28:28.440 --> 3:28:30.440]  And at the same time, many Americans won't be able
[3:28:30.440 --> 3:28:32.440]  to do it and they'll be
[3:28:32.440 --> 3:28:34.440]  they'll just get sick and die.
[3:28:34.440 --> 3:28:36.440]  I mean, that's what's going to happen.
[3:28:36.440 --> 3:28:38.440]  We've already entered
[3:28:38.440 --> 3:28:40.440]  essentially hyperinflation at least in the food sector
[3:28:40.440 --> 3:28:42.440]  because that, I mean, that's beyond the definition
[3:28:42.440 --> 3:28:44.440]  of hyperinflation and I think you're right.
[3:28:46.440 --> 3:28:48.440]  I mean, just a lumber price.
[3:28:48.440 --> 3:28:50.440]  Well, yeah.
[3:28:50.440 --> 3:28:52.440]  And then copper, aluminum, steel,
[3:28:52.440 --> 3:28:54.440]  try to build a steel building these days.
[3:28:54.440 --> 3:28:56.440]  But look, Bob, we're going to go to break here shortly
[3:28:56.440 --> 3:28:58.440]  and we're going to have you
[3:28:58.440 --> 3:29:00.440]  continue with us on the other side of that.
[3:29:00.440 --> 3:29:02.440]  But I want to specifically
[3:29:02.440 --> 3:29:04.440]  help people address this issue
[3:29:04.440 --> 3:29:06.440]  of when they understand
[3:29:06.440 --> 3:29:08.440]  what we're talking about, but they have a family member
[3:29:08.440 --> 3:29:10.440]  who doesn't get it.
[3:29:10.440 --> 3:29:12.440]  How do you wake up a family member
[3:29:12.440 --> 3:29:14.440]  so that they can get prepared for what's coming
[3:29:14.440 --> 3:29:16.440]  and you don't end up committing, you know,
[3:29:16.440 --> 3:29:18.440]  a lack of preparedness suicide?
[3:29:18.440 --> 3:29:20.440]  So we're going to talk about that when we come back.
[3:29:20.440 --> 3:29:22.440]  I'm Mike Adams here. This is the Alex Jones show
[3:29:22.440 --> 3:29:24.440]  the fourth hour today and we're talking with Bob Griswold.
[3:29:24.440 --> 3:29:26.440]  So stay with us after this break.
[3:29:26.440 --> 3:29:28.440]  We'll be right back with more
[3:29:28.440 --> 3:29:57.440]  on this topic to help you stay alive.
[3:29:58.440 --> 3:30:00.440]  We'll see you next time.
[3:30:28.440 --> 3:30:30.440]  We'll see you next time.
[3:30:58.440 --> 3:31:00.440]  We'll see you next time.
[3:31:28.440 --> 3:31:30.440]  We'll see you next time.
[3:31:58.440 --> 3:32:00.440]  We'll see you next time.
[3:32:28.440 --> 3:32:30.440]  We'll see you next time.
[3:32:58.440 --> 3:33:00.440]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[3:33:00.440 --> 3:33:02.440]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[3:33:02.440 --> 3:33:04.440]  for the product. The X2 does wonders.
[3:33:04.440 --> 3:33:06.440]  They recommend it to everybody.
[3:33:06.440 --> 3:33:08.440]  You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence.
[3:33:08.440 --> 3:33:10.440]  Get the product. Support the import.
[3:33:10.440 --> 3:33:12.440]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year.
[3:33:12.440 --> 3:33:14.440]  Thanks for holding it. Go ahead.
[3:33:14.440 --> 3:33:16.440]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[3:33:16.440 --> 3:33:18.440]  It's an honor to talk to you. Awesome.
[3:33:18.440 --> 3:33:20.440]  So first thing I wanted to do is say
[3:33:20.440 --> 3:33:22.440]  I love the products. Alpha Power
[3:33:22.440 --> 3:33:24.440]  even at 29, if you ask my better half,
[3:33:24.440 --> 3:33:26.440]  she loves it.
[3:33:26.440 --> 3:33:28.440]  This is the bedroom, so just number one
[3:33:28.440 --> 3:33:30.440]  for a few of you. I like that one.
[3:33:30.440 --> 3:33:32.440]  It works. It's not a joke.
[3:33:32.440 --> 3:33:34.440]  Absolutely.
[3:33:34.440 --> 3:34:02.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:34:02.440 --> 3:34:04.440]  Welcome back. This is Mike Adams,
[3:34:04.440 --> 3:34:06.440]  the health ranger here.
[3:34:06.440 --> 3:34:08.440]  This is the Alex Jones show on infowars.com.
[3:34:08.440 --> 3:34:10.440]  I'm the publisher of naturalnews.com.
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:12.440]  We've got a guest with us for this segment,
[3:34:12.440 --> 3:34:14.440]  Bob Griswold from ready-made resources.
[3:34:14.440 --> 3:34:16.440]  But real quick, just a comment.
[3:34:16.440 --> 3:34:18.440]  I don't know what you saw during the break,
[3:34:18.440 --> 3:34:20.440]  but I saw, you know, an ad,
[3:34:20.440 --> 3:34:22.440]  Alex and Mike Lindell
[3:34:22.440 --> 3:34:24.440]  getting together commercially
[3:34:24.440 --> 3:34:26.440]  with my pillow.
[3:34:26.440 --> 3:34:28.440]  And I think it's awesome.
[3:34:28.440 --> 3:34:30.440]  Mike Lindell really walks his talk.
[3:34:30.440 --> 3:34:32.440]  And folks, if you want this country
[3:34:32.440 --> 3:34:34.440]  to survive all of what's coming,
[3:34:34.440 --> 3:34:36.440]  it's absolutely crucial
[3:34:36.440 --> 3:34:38.440]  to vote with your consumer dollars
[3:34:38.440 --> 3:34:40.440]  for those platforms
[3:34:40.440 --> 3:34:42.440]  and those individuals
[3:34:42.440 --> 3:34:44.440]  who are fighting for America.
[3:34:44.440 --> 3:34:46.440]  And it's mypillow.com
[3:34:46.440 --> 3:34:48.440]  and use promo code Alex.
[3:34:48.440 --> 3:34:50.440]  And you'll be supporting both infowars
[3:34:50.440 --> 3:34:52.440]  as well as Mike Lindell's operation.
[3:34:52.440 --> 3:34:54.440]  So mypillow.com,
[3:34:54.440 --> 3:34:56.440]  promo code Alex for great discounts.
[3:34:56.440 --> 3:34:58.440]  I'm going to get some towels
[3:34:58.440 --> 3:35:00.440]  and pillowcases myself, by the way.
[3:35:00.440 --> 3:35:02.440]  So getting back to our topic
[3:35:02.440 --> 3:35:04.440]  of this segment,
[3:35:04.440 --> 3:35:06.440]  Bob, we left off
[3:35:06.440 --> 3:35:08.440]  with the question of, you know, a lot of people
[3:35:08.440 --> 3:35:10.440]  are fully aware of what's happening,
[3:35:10.440 --> 3:35:12.440]  but they have family members or friends
[3:35:12.440 --> 3:35:14.440]  or coworkers who are completely oblivious.
[3:35:14.440 --> 3:35:16.440]  And this is now really
[3:35:16.440 --> 3:35:18.440]  a life or death situation.
[3:35:18.440 --> 3:35:20.440]  If you don't prepare,
[3:35:20.440 --> 3:35:22.440]  you're very likely to not survive what's coming,
[3:35:22.440 --> 3:35:24.440]  especially if the financial collapse unfolds
[3:35:24.440 --> 3:35:26.440]  as we think it may. I mean, people are going to be
[3:35:26.440 --> 3:35:28.440]  wiped out and destitute, literally overnight,
[3:35:28.440 --> 3:35:30.440]  going to wake up the dollars worthless.
[3:35:30.440 --> 3:35:32.440]  How can people,
[3:35:32.440 --> 3:35:34.440]  I mean, because you've been successful at this
[3:35:34.440 --> 3:35:36.440]  in many cases, how can people talk
[3:35:36.440 --> 3:35:38.440]  to those who are
[3:35:38.440 --> 3:35:40.440]  zombified and awaken them
[3:35:40.440 --> 3:35:42.440]  to the reality of what's happening?
[3:35:42.440 --> 3:35:44.440]  Well, sometimes you can't talk to them, Mike. Sometimes you can.
[3:35:44.440 --> 3:35:46.440]  And you have to make that determination.
[3:35:46.440 --> 3:35:48.440]  You know, if you're a mother and you have a husband
[3:35:48.440 --> 3:35:50.440]  who's not into it, you have to look at your
[3:35:50.440 --> 3:35:52.440]  children and say, what am I going to do?
[3:35:52.440 --> 3:35:54.440]  I have to take something
[3:35:54.440 --> 3:35:56.440]  that you're going to have to understand.
[3:35:56.440 --> 3:35:58.440]  I'm going to set food aside as much as I can.
[3:35:58.440 --> 3:36:00.440]  If you're a husband and it's vice versa,
[3:36:00.440 --> 3:36:02.440]  you have a bigger picture
[3:36:02.440 --> 3:36:04.440]  than just yourself.
[3:36:04.440 --> 3:36:06.440]  We have children, we have family,
[3:36:06.440 --> 3:36:08.440]  and we need to make sure we can take care of them.
[3:36:08.440 --> 3:36:10.440]  You know, I always, I love history.
[3:36:10.440 --> 3:36:12.440]  I always challenge people historically.
[3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:14.440]  Show me a case, a situation
[3:36:14.440 --> 3:36:16.440]  where a nation's doing what we're doing
[3:36:16.440 --> 3:36:18.440]  that has not ended in absolute disaster
[3:36:18.440 --> 3:36:20.440]  and lots of body bags.
[3:36:20.440 --> 3:36:22.440]  You know, in the black book of communism,
[3:36:22.440 --> 3:36:24.440]  one thing Godless states have in common
[3:36:24.440 --> 3:36:26.440]  is a lot of body bags.
[3:36:26.440 --> 3:36:28.440]  Well, America is headed to that situation.
[3:36:28.440 --> 3:36:30.440]  I mean, you throw on top of it
[3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:32.440]  these planned outages,
[3:36:32.440 --> 3:36:34.440]  these planned shortages,
[3:36:34.440 --> 3:36:36.440]  the planned vaccine cards,
[3:36:36.440 --> 3:36:38.440]  where you won't be able to access your money or food
[3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:40.440]  without your vaccine card,
[3:36:40.440 --> 3:36:42.440]  but you also look at what's happening out west right now.
[3:36:42.440 --> 3:36:44.440]  The severe, catastrophic,
[3:36:44.440 --> 3:36:46.440]  1,000-year drought,
[3:36:46.440 --> 3:36:48.440]  locus eating food.
[3:36:48.440 --> 3:36:50.440]  I mean, it's at our door.
[3:36:50.440 --> 3:36:52.440]  The thing, again, what Americans need to do
[3:36:52.440 --> 3:36:54.440]  right now are brothers and sisters
[3:36:54.440 --> 3:36:56.440]  that are listed in this program.
[3:36:56.440 --> 3:36:58.440]  You need to go out and make a list.
[3:36:58.440 --> 3:37:00.440]  You need to take some hard time,
[3:37:00.440 --> 3:37:02.440]  make a list of what your family needs,
[3:37:02.440 --> 3:37:04.440]  and then start accumulating it,
[3:37:04.440 --> 3:37:06.440]  because every day that goes by,
[3:37:06.440 --> 3:37:08.440]  I can promise you that dollar is worth less than less.
[3:37:08.440 --> 3:37:10.440]  You're going to see smaller packaging,
[3:37:10.440 --> 3:37:12.440]  you're going to see rationing,
[3:37:12.440 --> 3:37:14.440]  you're going to see products unavailable,
[3:37:14.440 --> 3:37:16.440]  and eventually, you won't be able to get it at all
[3:37:16.440 --> 3:37:18.440]  because it'll be for the elite,
[3:37:18.440 --> 3:37:20.440]  and they'll carve you into death is what they'll do.
[3:37:20.440 --> 3:37:22.440]  You know,
[3:37:22.440 --> 3:37:24.440]  I like church history.
[3:37:24.440 --> 3:37:26.440]  There's a church father
[3:37:26.440 --> 3:37:28.440]  from about 200 AD
[3:37:28.440 --> 3:37:30.440]  Hippolytus,
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:32.440]  and I was talking to Steve about him the other day.
[3:37:32.440 --> 3:37:34.440]  In 200 AD,
[3:37:34.440 --> 3:37:36.440]  he wrote that this evil system
[3:37:36.440 --> 3:37:38.440]  at the end,
[3:37:38.440 --> 3:37:40.440]  the antichrist system,
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:42.440]  would use food as a coercion mechanism
[3:37:42.440 --> 3:37:44.440]  to make you take his mark.
[3:37:44.440 --> 3:37:46.440]  I mean, it's in the history of the church
[3:37:46.440 --> 3:37:48.440]  that they actually said that
[3:37:48.440 --> 3:37:50.440]  they will use food
[3:37:50.440 --> 3:37:52.440]  to coerce you into taking the mark, the vaccine,
[3:37:52.440 --> 3:37:54.440]  whatever it is.
[3:37:54.440 --> 3:37:56.440]  Well, famine, and plague, and war,
[3:37:56.440 --> 3:37:58.440]  and the forehorsemen of the apocalypse,
[3:37:58.440 --> 3:38:00.440]  it's all right there.
[3:38:00.440 --> 3:38:02.440]  While you still have this
[3:38:02.440 --> 3:38:04.440]  brief moment left,
[3:38:04.440 --> 3:38:06.440]  where your dollar's depreciating,
[3:38:06.440 --> 3:38:08.440]  the food supply's diminishing,
[3:38:08.440 --> 3:38:10.440]  you better act, because if you're not,
[3:38:10.440 --> 3:38:12.440]  you will be one of those people in the streets
[3:38:12.440 --> 3:38:14.440]  begging.
[3:38:14.440 --> 3:38:16.440]  It took me a long time to get over some of the things I saw.
[3:38:16.440 --> 3:38:18.440]  But you will be
[3:38:18.440 --> 3:38:20.440]  willing to trade anything you have,
[3:38:20.440 --> 3:38:22.440]  your person, your body,
[3:38:22.440 --> 3:38:24.440]  anything, and no matter how degrading
[3:38:24.440 --> 3:38:26.440]  it will be
[3:38:26.440 --> 3:38:28.440]  for a little food.
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:30.440]  Why would you want to be there?
[3:38:30.440 --> 3:38:32.440]  I would say to those watching,
[3:38:32.440 --> 3:38:34.440]  because we haven't gone into your full background,
[3:38:34.440 --> 3:38:36.440]  and I'm not even sure you can talk about some of it,
[3:38:36.440 --> 3:38:38.440]  but the point is,
[3:38:38.440 --> 3:38:40.440]  you have seen more than enough
[3:38:40.440 --> 3:38:42.440]  that makes you a Christian man
[3:38:42.440 --> 3:38:44.440]  and a patriot American,
[3:38:44.440 --> 3:38:46.440]  because you do not want to see
[3:38:46.440 --> 3:38:48.440]  those things happen in this country,
[3:38:48.440 --> 3:38:50.440]  because you know what a nightmare it is,
[3:38:50.440 --> 3:38:52.440]  and people can just probably connect the dots
[3:38:52.440 --> 3:38:54.440]  on some of that.
[3:38:54.440 --> 3:38:56.440]  Let me ask you this, Bob.
[3:38:56.440 --> 3:38:58.440]  In the last two weeks, I've had high-level people
[3:38:58.440 --> 3:39:00.440]  reach out to me, and I'm talking from the world of finance.
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:02.440]  Like, billionaire
[3:39:02.440 --> 3:39:04.440]  people,
[3:39:04.440 --> 3:39:06.440]  not the couple that you and I both know,
[3:39:06.440 --> 3:39:08.440]  I'm not talking about them, I'm talking about people in,
[3:39:08.440 --> 3:39:10.440]  like, global billionaires in finance
[3:39:10.440 --> 3:39:12.440]  reach out to me
[3:39:12.440 --> 3:39:14.440]  to say,
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:16.440]  hey, I just realized that you were right
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:18.440]  about all this stuff,
[3:39:18.440 --> 3:39:20.440]  and they would say,
[3:39:20.440 --> 3:39:22.440]  I know all about finance, and I don't know anything
[3:39:22.440 --> 3:39:24.440]  about rural living, or preparedness,
[3:39:24.440 --> 3:39:26.440]  or firearms, or self-defense, or anything.
[3:39:26.440 --> 3:39:28.440]  Where do I begin?
[3:39:28.440 --> 3:39:30.440]  And I'm thinking, where do you begin?
[3:39:30.440 --> 3:39:32.440]  Dude, the hour is late.
[3:39:32.440 --> 3:39:34.440]  You know how late you are to this game?
[3:39:34.440 --> 3:39:36.440]  What can people do
[3:39:36.440 --> 3:39:38.440]  if they're just waking up now?
[3:39:38.440 --> 3:39:40.440]  How can they
[3:39:40.440 --> 3:39:42.440]  even begin to prepare now?
[3:39:42.440 --> 3:39:44.440]  Well, common sense will tell you a lot of it.
[3:39:44.440 --> 3:39:46.440]  I mean, you know you have to eat every day.
[3:39:46.440 --> 3:39:48.440]  You know you have to drink water every day.
[3:39:48.440 --> 3:39:50.440]  You know that we're becoming more and more of a violence
[3:39:50.440 --> 3:39:52.440]  society every day.
[3:39:52.440 --> 3:39:54.440]  I mean, it doesn't take a brilliant person
[3:39:54.440 --> 3:39:56.440]  to address those issues.
[3:39:56.440 --> 3:39:58.440]  I mean, just to start having food
[3:39:58.440 --> 3:40:00.440]  aside in your home, water, or the ability
[3:40:00.440 --> 3:40:02.440]  to purify water, or water in your home,
[3:40:02.440 --> 3:40:04.440]  and the ability to protect yourself,
[3:40:04.440 --> 3:40:06.440]  those are pretty simple issues to do.
[3:40:06.440 --> 3:40:08.440]  I mean, you know, you don't have to
[3:40:08.440 --> 3:40:10.440]  have your phones being out of talk.
[3:40:10.440 --> 3:40:12.440]  I mean, nothing is worse than having a
[3:40:12.440 --> 3:40:14.440]  loved one away from the house
[3:40:14.440 --> 3:40:16.440]  when a disaster happens, and you can't
[3:40:16.440 --> 3:40:18.440]  contact them.
[3:40:18.440 --> 3:40:20.440]  So you don't know where they're at.
[3:40:20.440 --> 3:40:22.440]  You don't know what's happened to them.
[3:40:22.440 --> 3:40:24.440]  So communication, you know, it's one of my
[3:40:24.440 --> 3:40:26.440]  things I hold dear and near to my heart.
[3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:28.440]  The ability to communicate, be it a listen,
[3:40:28.440 --> 3:40:30.440]  be it receive data, give data,
[3:40:30.440 --> 3:40:32.440]  that's near and dear to my heart.
[3:40:32.440 --> 3:40:34.440]  If you've waited this long
[3:40:34.440 --> 3:40:36.440]  for money, and you better have somebody
[3:40:36.440 --> 3:40:38.440]  start putting you on the fast lane
[3:40:38.440 --> 3:40:40.440]  and start acquiring stuff at breakneck
[3:40:40.440 --> 3:40:42.440]  speed, because it is not
[3:40:42.440 --> 3:40:44.440]  going to be available. We always
[3:40:44.440 --> 3:40:46.440]  think, well, if I have enough money,
[3:40:46.440 --> 3:40:48.440]  I can buy anything. Well, when it's not
[3:40:48.440 --> 3:40:50.440]  available, it's not available.
[3:40:50.440 --> 3:40:52.440]  Your money will not save you at this
[3:40:52.440 --> 3:40:54.440]  point. It's going to be worthless.
[3:40:54.440 --> 3:40:56.440]  You're going to throw it in the street
[3:40:56.440 --> 3:40:58.440]  because it's going to be worthless. But the
[3:40:58.440 --> 3:41:00.440]  person who has food in their home,
[3:41:00.440 --> 3:41:02.440]  they're the ones that are going to be
[3:41:02.440 --> 3:41:04.440]  going to everyone else because they're not
[3:41:04.440 --> 3:41:06.440]  going to notice their children getting skinnier
[3:41:06.440 --> 3:41:08.440]  and skinnier, and mommy, I'm hungry.
[3:41:08.440 --> 3:41:10.440]  They're not going to hear that. And you
[3:41:10.440 --> 3:41:12.440]  might say that's an emotional pull
[3:41:12.440 --> 3:41:14.440]  on somebody's heart. I've seen that.
[3:41:14.440 --> 3:41:16.440]  Mommy, I'm hungry. That's not a fun thing
[3:41:16.440 --> 3:41:18.440]  to hear. And so if you
[3:41:18.440 --> 3:41:20.440]  don't act upon it, you're going to hear
[3:41:20.440 --> 3:41:22.440]  that one form or another, and it's going
[3:41:22.440 --> 3:41:24.440]  to wrench your heart out because you could
[3:41:24.440 --> 3:41:26.440]  have done something while you had time
[3:41:26.440 --> 3:41:28.440]  to do it. And then you wasted the time.
[3:41:28.440 --> 3:41:30.440]  You pitted it away with whatever, watching
[3:41:30.440 --> 3:41:32.440]  football game or spending money on something
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:34.440]  you didn't need to spend it on when all along
[3:41:34.440 --> 3:41:36.440]  the signs of
[3:41:36.440 --> 3:41:38.440]  what's happening are historic.
[3:41:38.440 --> 3:41:40.440]  They happened before. They're happening again.
[3:41:40.440 --> 3:41:42.440]  And if you ignore them, you will
[3:41:42.440 --> 3:41:44.440]  die, period.
[3:41:44.440 --> 3:41:46.440]  And all the money in the world, like you said,
[3:41:46.440 --> 3:41:48.440]  can't save you. You know, Elon Musk
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:50.440]  reportedly recently bought
[3:41:50.440 --> 3:41:52.440]  quite a bit of acreage in Central
[3:41:52.440 --> 3:41:54.440]  Texas. And as you know, the
[3:41:54.440 --> 3:41:56.440]  Infawars operation is in Central Texas.
[3:41:56.440 --> 3:41:58.440]  My operations in Central
[3:41:58.440 --> 3:42:00.440]  Texas. Now, Elon Musk
[3:42:00.440 --> 3:42:02.440]  is in Central Texas. And
[3:42:02.440 --> 3:42:04.440]  I was thinking, someone asked me about this the other day.
[3:42:04.440 --> 3:42:06.440]  What do you think about that?
[3:42:06.440 --> 3:42:08.440]  And I said, you know what? Elon Musk
[3:42:08.440 --> 3:42:10.440]  doesn't have what I have.
[3:42:10.440 --> 3:42:12.440]  Because I've been prepping for 20
[3:42:12.440 --> 3:42:14.440]  years. Elon Musk, all the money in the world,
[3:42:14.440 --> 3:42:16.440]  I would not trade
[3:42:16.440 --> 3:42:18.440]  my situation for his situation. I don't care
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:20.440]  if he's got rocket ships to Mars.
[3:42:20.440 --> 3:42:22.440]  You know, I want to survive here on Earth
[3:42:22.440 --> 3:42:24.440]  and I've got knowledge, know how
[3:42:24.440 --> 3:42:26.440]  preps, gear, community
[3:42:26.440 --> 3:42:28.440]  people, radio, you know, comms,
[3:42:28.440 --> 3:42:30.440]  frequencies, everything. Elon Musk,
[3:42:30.440 --> 3:42:32.440]  he doesn't have that stuff. If the dollar crashes,
[3:42:32.440 --> 3:42:34.440]  his wealth vanishes.
[3:42:34.440 --> 3:42:36.440]  His whole operation vanishes.
[3:42:36.440 --> 3:42:38.440]  And at the end of the day, you need food, water,
[3:42:38.440 --> 3:42:40.440]  self-defense, all that stuff.
[3:42:40.440 --> 3:42:42.440]  It was Bitcoin worth
[3:42:42.440 --> 3:42:44.440]  just a few months ago. It's cut in half now.
[3:42:44.440 --> 3:42:46.440]  Right. I mean, people lost half their wealth.
[3:42:46.440 --> 3:42:48.440]  Overnight, it just disappeared
[3:42:48.440 --> 3:42:50.440]  because at the end it really
[3:42:50.440 --> 3:42:52.440]  wasn't wealth. You know, they say all wealth
[3:42:52.440 --> 3:42:54.440]  comes from the earth. So if it didn't come out of
[3:42:54.440 --> 3:42:56.440]  the earth, it's probably not real wealth.
[3:42:56.440 --> 3:42:58.440]  And you know, Mike, you hit a big key.
[3:42:58.440 --> 3:43:00.440]  Experience and knowledge.
[3:43:00.440 --> 3:43:02.440]  You know, that, you're under
[3:43:02.440 --> 3:43:04.440]  a real
[3:43:04.440 --> 3:43:06.440]  deadline here because if you've not
[3:43:06.440 --> 3:43:08.440]  gained that experience and knowledge
[3:43:08.440 --> 3:43:10.440]  of knowing how to, I mean, whether it's from
[3:43:10.440 --> 3:43:12.440]  gardening, how to shoot a gun,
[3:43:12.440 --> 3:43:14.440]  how to move tactically, how to use a radio,
[3:43:14.440 --> 3:43:16.440]  any of those things, which people
[3:43:16.440 --> 3:43:18.440]  who've been prepping a long time have applied
[3:43:18.440 --> 3:43:20.440]  those disciplines and learned those disciplines
[3:43:20.440 --> 3:43:22.440]  in their life, you know, from
[3:43:22.440 --> 3:43:24.440]  scoring a garden to shooting a gun to whatever.
[3:43:24.440 --> 3:43:26.440]  You can't buy that.
[3:43:26.440 --> 3:43:28.440]  You can't buy it. I mean, it's you
[3:43:28.440 --> 3:43:30.440]  can't buy the experience of going through
[3:43:30.440 --> 3:43:32.440]  boot camp or
[3:43:32.440 --> 3:43:34.440]  budge training, Navy SEAL budge training.
[3:43:34.440 --> 3:43:36.440]  You could have $20 million and say, I'll give you
[3:43:36.440 --> 3:43:38.440]  $20 million, just, you know, give me a
[3:43:38.440 --> 3:43:40.440]  certificate so I know all this stuff.
[3:43:40.440 --> 3:43:42.440]  That doesn't work. If you haven't gone through
[3:43:42.440 --> 3:43:44.440]  those...
[3:43:44.440 --> 3:43:46.440]  Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[3:43:46.440 --> 3:43:48.440]  We're out of time. We're going to wrap this up, but you're exactly
[3:43:48.440 --> 3:43:50.440]  right. Experience counts and
[3:43:50.440 --> 3:43:52.440]  you can't buy it. You have to earn it.
[3:43:52.440 --> 3:43:54.440]  You've got to go through the training.
[3:43:54.440 --> 3:43:56.440]  You know, I remember going through emergency
[3:43:56.440 --> 3:43:58.440]  medic training stuff and gauze
[3:43:58.440 --> 3:44:00.440]  into wounds on, you know,
[3:44:00.440 --> 3:44:02.440]  dummy humans while there's live rifle
[3:44:02.440 --> 3:44:04.440]  fire, you know, and putting on
[3:44:04.440 --> 3:44:06.440]  tourniquets with one hand. Yeah, you can't
[3:44:06.440 --> 3:44:08.440]  you can't buy that experience. You got to earn it.
[3:44:08.440 --> 3:44:10.440]  But folks, take this seriously
[3:44:10.440 --> 3:44:12.440]  and Bob, thank you for joining us today.

[3:44:16.440 --> 3:44:18.440]  Well, I'm not sure who's the regular host
[3:44:18.440 --> 3:44:20.440]  today. This is a fourth hour. Alex Jones
