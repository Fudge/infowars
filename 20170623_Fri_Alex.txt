[00:00.000 --> 00:23.640]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen, hard to believe it's already Friday, the 23rd
[00:23.640 --> 00:30.960]  day of June 2017 and all hell is breaking loose.
[00:30.960 --> 00:34.480]  The Democrats have lost a fourth consecutive special election.
[00:34.480 --> 00:41.600]  They consecutively broke all previous records in each one of the four failed special elections
[00:41.600 --> 00:48.400]  as President Trump was sworn in on January 20, 2017.
[00:48.400 --> 00:54.920]  The day the power began to transfer from Washington and from globalist combines offshore back
[00:54.920 --> 00:58.760]  to we the people.
[00:58.760 --> 01:05.680]  And he's been delivering in royal spades and the globalist who've hijacked our country,
[01:05.680 --> 01:10.560]  hijacked Europe, hijacked Latin America, hijacked Africa, hijacked Eastern Europe, hijacked
[01:10.560 --> 01:20.040]  Russia, hijacked the Middle East, hard and total complete absolute freak out mode.
[01:20.040 --> 01:25.680]  They burned through 35 million on the special elections and that was just the party, not
[01:25.680 --> 01:29.600]  just their packs, unbelievable.
[01:29.600 --> 01:33.840]  And so how do they respond being spoiled brat, want to be elitist, who are part of a cult
[01:33.840 --> 01:37.560]  of power who believe that they're sitting on top of the bitter clingers and that they
[01:37.560 --> 01:41.040]  control the Christians and the patriots and I guess they do.
[01:41.040 --> 01:45.120]  They have our children in their clutches, they brainwash them, they force inoculate
[01:45.120 --> 01:50.160]  them, but the sleeping giant is awakening to what they're doing so they're trying to
[01:50.160 --> 01:51.600]  cling on to the host.
[01:51.600 --> 01:56.240]  The parasites are in a desperate, insane panic.
[01:56.240 --> 01:58.480]  Do they back off?
[01:58.480 --> 02:05.960]  No, Johnny Depp, a meth head, $600 million that he made the last 20 years, lost it all,
[02:05.960 --> 02:11.480]  looks like again some meth mouth guy, some kind of homeless person you see on the side
[02:11.480 --> 02:17.240]  of the street, he comes out like he's a big tough man, he can hardly stand up with some
[02:17.240 --> 02:23.440]  other water head and they stand up there and talk about how they dream about killing the
[02:23.440 --> 02:24.440]  president.
[02:24.440 --> 02:30.160]  Oh, how original by another spoiled rotten piece of filth that if you don't like America
[02:30.160 --> 02:31.160]  you should move to North Korea.
[02:31.160 --> 02:36.160]  In fact, Paul Watson has a video we're going to play coming up, the dubbous liberal ever
[02:36.160 --> 02:41.400]  and the woman says she wants more Muslims, they're not a threat, she says white men are.
[02:41.400 --> 02:50.440]  Some addled, spoiled, pension fund, government funded, college paid for, scholarship, whining
[02:50.440 --> 02:51.440]  idiot.
[02:51.440 --> 02:55.160]  I am going to offer this moron.
[02:55.160 --> 03:05.800]  First class tickets, first class tickets and 20,000 pounds to move for one year to Libya
[03:05.800 --> 03:09.560]  or to Syria, I'm sorry those are total war zones thanks to you people, helping put the
[03:09.560 --> 03:10.560]  radical jihadis in.
[03:10.560 --> 03:11.560]  How about Saudi Arabia?
[03:11.560 --> 03:19.360]  I'm offering you 20,000 pounds, that's $35,000, $30,000 and I'm offering you first class one
[03:19.360 --> 03:23.040]  way tickets to re-odd Saudi Arabia baby.
[03:23.040 --> 03:27.160]  You go there, you run your mouth, you show your face in public, they'll cane you and
[03:27.160 --> 03:29.040]  next they'll kill you.
[03:29.040 --> 03:34.360]  The headline will be, Jones wishes Muslims to kill a poor woman, that's how they spend
[03:34.360 --> 03:40.080]  it when J.L.O. is like bring in more Muslims or any of these globalist minions and I go
[03:40.080 --> 03:46.000]  hey, why don't you go move there then, oh, oh no, we're not going to do that and the
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.600]  media spends that I hope they go to the Middle East and get raped, no, I hope you don't bring
[03:50.600 --> 03:57.040]  that here because I've got three daughters and a son and I don't like it, I don't want
[03:57.040 --> 04:02.600]  to bring North Korea here, hell they're trying to transplant whole Syrian towns of invaders
[04:02.600 --> 04:07.840]  that came in and took over into Germany right now, they've already brought 10 million in,
[04:07.840 --> 04:11.360]  I'm sorry I kept seeing 5 million in the last couple of years and 7 million total in the
[04:11.360 --> 04:21.480]  last 8 years, no it's 10 million, everybody's heard about Islamic scourge, we're going to
[04:21.480 --> 04:27.600]  go to Beret, come back with Johnny Depp all of it today, I am wound up and I'm in my Info
[04:27.600 --> 04:33.240]  Wars uniform today, I'm not wearing the sports jacket and the button up shirt because I need
[04:33.240 --> 04:40.680]  to be able to get wound up proper here today, oh, Tuck Buckford's wound up today, everybody,
[04:40.680 --> 04:48.160]  you'll get ready because this is the Info War, we're going in through and beyond, spread
[04:48.160 --> 04:52.120]  the word, spread the links, the live feeds on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, your local
[04:52.120 --> 04:57.280]  station, spread the word, it's an act of resistance against the dirtbag globalists that know they're
[04:57.280 --> 04:59.240]  hanging on by their fingernails.
[04:59.240 --> 05:05.520]  Wow, you're going to love the latest idea out of the EU, Scott Keller, a German member
[05:05.520 --> 05:10.320]  of the European Parliament and of the Green Party said we should transplant entire villages
[05:10.320 --> 05:15.000]  from Syria to Germany and that would encourage more migrants to enter Germany, listen to
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.760]  these quotes, the idea of Syrian villages is only one possibility we can use, for example,
[05:20.760 --> 05:24.360]  if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees, people would
[05:24.360 --> 05:29.680]  rather go where compatriots already live, which makes integration and acceptance easier.
[05:29.680 --> 05:33.920]  Let's look at these three compatriots from Paul Joseph Watson, Sweden, migrants viciously
[05:33.920 --> 05:38.440]  beat disabled man while calling him racist, three compatriot refugees attempted to steal
[05:38.440 --> 05:42.360]  a homeless man's wallet in a train station during an incident which took place last month.
[05:42.360 --> 05:45.800]  The handicapped man was kicked and punched and received a vicious uppercut as one of
[05:45.800 --> 05:49.720]  the migrants lectured him about war on Muslims and how all Swedes were racist.
[05:49.720 --> 05:51.640]  Now how's that for acceptance?
[05:51.640 --> 05:54.840]  You can read both articles now on Infowars.com.
[05:54.840 --> 05:58.320]  Rob Jure reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[05:58.320 --> 06:02.880]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[06:02.880 --> 06:04.760]  in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[06:04.760 --> 06:08.560]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week, I thought it would be a six-month
[06:08.560 --> 06:09.560]  supply for listeners.
[06:09.560 --> 06:13.800]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their
[06:13.800 --> 06:14.800]  Super Blue.
[06:14.800 --> 06:18.040]  Research across the board is clear, in fact, it's certified.
[06:18.040 --> 06:21.920]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[06:21.920 --> 06:22.920]  clots and heart attacks.
[06:22.920 --> 06:27.640]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[06:27.640 --> 06:30.200]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[06:30.200 --> 06:34.400]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[06:34.400 --> 06:36.960]  iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[06:36.960 --> 06:42.280]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients, uses Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria
[06:42.280 --> 06:43.720]  and eliminate bad breath.
[06:43.720 --> 06:48.160]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,

[06:59.080 --> 07:04.240]  Hendricks Essentials, that's my middle name, I've spent seven years off and on trying to

[07:10.880 --> 07:13.560]  personal care products that's organic and high quality.

[07:22.720 --> 07:27.240]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.

[08:09.800 --> 08:13.800]  the Infowar.
[08:13.800 --> 08:21.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, the 23rd day of June 2017 and everybody knows, I don't
[08:21.000 --> 08:27.520]  put a good face on things unless really good things are happening and that is happening
[08:27.520 --> 08:29.160]  right now.
[08:29.160 --> 08:33.840]  The air is electrical with political change across the globe, not just here but the United
[08:33.840 --> 08:34.840]  States.
[08:34.840 --> 08:39.440]  We've seen four special elections with the Democrats spending more money than they've
[08:39.440 --> 08:45.720]  ever spent in any other elections and they lost, despite the mainstream media demonization,
[08:45.720 --> 08:50.760]  the dirty tricks, the illegals voting, people voting under dead people's identities, it's
[08:50.760 --> 08:56.960]  all been confirmed, 5.7 million voting illegally, all of it confirmed now coming out in the
[08:56.960 --> 09:03.240]  last election but still they lost despite the fake polls, despite giving the debate
[09:03.240 --> 09:10.240]  questions weeks before to Hillary to try to rig it despite having the moderators go after
[09:10.240 --> 09:12.600]  Trump where it'd be three to one.
[09:12.600 --> 09:17.640]  Trump called it out and said, it's three to one but still I'm winning and it's that
[09:17.640 --> 09:21.560]  same attitude, ladies and gentlemen, that we've all got to have.
[09:21.560 --> 09:27.640]  Forget the Super Bowl, forget NBA basketball, this is the real game of life for the future
[09:27.640 --> 09:31.920]  of America and the world, freedom versus slavery.
[09:31.920 --> 09:35.920]  This is such an amazing time to be alive, this is going to be a powerful transmission
[09:35.920 --> 09:37.560]  today.
[09:37.560 --> 09:43.440]  Just look at these headlines, MSNBC's presidency, Trump is developing a dictatorship, must
[09:43.440 --> 09:44.440]  be stopped.
[09:44.440 --> 09:49.920]  MSNBC analysts compares Trump to a suicide bomber and of course another MSNBC host
[09:49.920 --> 09:55.640]  and analyst called for ISIS to hit Trump properties like Trump Tower, so everything
[09:55.640 --> 10:00.560]  they say about Trump, they are, they're trying to overthrow the election and set up a dictatorship
[10:00.560 --> 10:03.240]  of the bureaucracy in the deep state.
[10:03.240 --> 10:09.160]  Connecticut campus shut as professor flees following let them effing die tweet directing
[10:09.160 --> 10:14.800]  students to begin killing right wingers and Trump supporters and all bigots saying smile
[10:14.800 --> 10:19.360]  a bit as you kill them and as you murder them.
[10:19.360 --> 10:24.840]  More and more campuses are just totally having to shut because of mass total mental illness,
[10:24.840 --> 10:25.840]  unbelievable.
[10:25.840 --> 10:30.880]  These are reeducation camps but they've been contained, they're designed to be culture
[10:30.880 --> 10:35.360]  bombs, they're designed to be social disruptor systems, that's all declassified but if you
[10:35.360 --> 10:40.880]  contain them, if you contain the weapon system and it can't replicate, it degrades and implodes
[10:40.880 --> 10:46.080]  on itself and they're going through a degrade implosion right now, we're having devastating
[10:46.080 --> 10:51.000]  victories, devastating, we're devastating the enemy worldwide.
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.080]  They may set off a nuke in DC, they may release a bio weapon though, Soros and the globalist
[10:55.080 --> 10:59.600]  are very wicked, do not underestimate them but even if that happens, the survivors will
[10:59.600 --> 11:03.160]  dig them out of their bunkers, we will dig you out of your bunkers no matter where you
[11:03.160 --> 11:07.360]  go globalist, even if you release the bio weapon, we're fully aware of your plans.
[11:07.360 --> 11:11.280]  Continuing ladies and gentlemen, the military is fully aware of your operations, you're
[11:11.280 --> 11:14.600]  all right now in the sights and you know it, don't you globalist?
[11:14.600 --> 11:19.440]  Yeah, this is a two way street baby and you've now shown yourself, just keep showing yourself,
[11:19.440 --> 11:23.280]  keep burning yourself down, that's all coming up but let me put the cherry on top before
[11:23.280 --> 11:26.520]  I do this key report that Darren McBrain put together.
[11:26.520 --> 11:32.040]  Johnny Depp is a drug addict meth head that looks like a child molester you'd see on
[11:32.040 --> 11:35.240]  the side of the road, okay, I'm not saying he's a child molester, he just looks like
[11:35.240 --> 11:36.240]  one.
[11:36.240 --> 11:41.040]  Johnny Depp is a talentless joke trying to act cool, hey Stevie Ray Vaughn could play
[11:41.040 --> 11:47.360]  the guitar great and had that style in the 80s, he was cool, you look like just a joke
[11:47.360 --> 11:53.240]  stumbling around, $600 million you made, you lost it all, you've got some other old geezer
[11:53.240 --> 11:59.000]  liberal wannabe trendy, I mean I used to not like Hollywood, I can't look at it, I can't
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.120]  listen to it, I can hardly put up with any of it anymore, it is just so anti-human, so
[12:05.120 --> 12:10.960]  elitist, so drugged out, so brainwashed, so filthy rich while it's bitching about Trump
[12:10.960 --> 12:15.320]  trying to cut taxes for the middle class and trying to get jobs back for factory workers,
[12:15.320 --> 12:20.200]  it's just sick and I saw it this morning and couldn't find good audio of it because he's
[12:20.200 --> 12:25.440]  mumbling so bad and then he just sits there like he's such a genius when he says he dreams
[12:25.440 --> 12:29.680]  of killing Trump, of assassinating Trump, like he's the greatest genius ever and then
[12:29.680 --> 12:38.400]  you see a bunch of just moronic mind numbed zombie looking twit fans when he says it just
[12:38.400 --> 12:46.880]  hold on every word like God had just said something, no, a meth head loser joke punk
[12:46.880 --> 12:54.240]  jumped on the whole bandwagon of other harpies and seahags like Madonna and everybody else
[12:54.240 --> 13:00.520]  saying kill, kill, kill, kill, kill Trump, kill his supporters, kill America, kill Christians,
[13:00.520 --> 13:05.760]  kill flyover country, bring in the radical Muslims, have women wear hijabs, we're allied
[13:05.760 --> 13:10.600]  with anything that hates Christendom and hates western civilization and hates freedom.
[13:10.600 --> 13:14.920]  But here's the good news, all over Africa, all over Latin America people are rejecting
[13:14.920 --> 13:19.560]  globalism and they're rejecting it here, people want prosperity, they want freedom, they want
[13:19.560 --> 13:24.600]  families, they want true diversity, they want true open societies but not bullying brainwash
[13:24.600 --> 13:30.040]  facilities we see everywhere so Johnny Depp is such a pathetic, I'm not just saying that
[13:30.040 --> 13:36.920]  you know it, just a just a doddering drug doubt with meth mouth, he can barely talk,
[13:36.920 --> 13:40.680]  look like Carrie Fisher, feel sorry for her, you know she was a drug addict admittedly
[13:40.680 --> 13:46.200]  but at least she wasn't a hateful person politically, Depp is this drug doubt, shrivel
[13:46.200 --> 13:51.800]  brained, looks like a child molester, you'd see him again driving around in a creeper
[13:51.800 --> 13:58.540]  van and he's up there dreaming of can actors kill presidents or have, oh but I'm not an
[13:58.540 --> 14:03.840]  actor making a little joke trying to invoke murder and death, hey Johnny Depp can somebody
[14:03.840 --> 14:08.040]  find out where you're at sometime and walk up and pump a bunch of bullets into your sorry
[14:08.040 --> 14:11.680]  ass because I don't want that to happen, I don't walk around in people's yards trying
[14:11.680 --> 14:16.720]  to find dog crap to step in but you know if dogs keep laying it down in front of us we're
[14:16.720 --> 14:21.600]  going to step on some of you by accident, you jerk, I mean you think you're playing
[14:21.600 --> 14:26.600]  games here boy, you and you Hollywood scum bunch of wannabe gangsters, you've taken America's
[14:26.600 --> 14:31.320]  kindness and openness to crap all over it and that time's coming to an end so to you
[14:31.320 --> 14:35.160]  and all the Hollywood gangsters and all of you and I know who you are by name, you better
[14:35.160 --> 14:40.800]  watch your ass because we're going to kick your ass politically just like 1776 you keep
[14:40.800 --> 14:45.360]  running your mouth and starting a violent war that you're beating the drums for, you
[14:45.360 --> 14:50.280]  know what's going to happen to you, let's play Johnny Slimeball Depp.
[14:50.280 --> 15:02.880]  I think he needs help, I don't know, a lot of wonderful dark places he could go, a lot
[15:02.880 --> 15:10.400]  of dark martins, it's just a question I'm not insinuating anything by the way this is
[15:10.400 --> 15:16.160]  going to be in the press, it'll be harder, I'd like that you're all a part of it, when
[15:16.160 --> 15:19.960]  was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[15:19.960 --> 15:28.440]  When was the last time somebody killed an actor for running their mouth, I mean seriously?
[15:28.440 --> 15:39.400]  No, I want to clarify, I'm not an actor, I lie for the living, I try you do you piece
[15:39.400 --> 15:44.880]  of filth, turn him off, Darren McGrane did an incredibly powerful piece on the deep state
[15:44.880 --> 15:49.720]  that I'm going to premiere at the bottom of the hour, but if you look at all of this,
[15:49.720 --> 15:55.400]  I mean these people are on every channel there is, beating the drum incessantly to kill Trump,
[15:55.400 --> 16:03.720]  kill his family, kidnap his wife, rape her, and Bowell had the sense to come out and apologize
[16:03.720 --> 16:07.520]  and Snoop Dogg has had the decency to shut his mouth because here's the deal, you got
[16:07.520 --> 16:12.040]  your free speech, but you keep calling for killing people and Trump supporters are getting
[16:12.040 --> 16:16.920]  shot and stabbed all over the place, congressman got shot, was fighting for his life until
[16:16.920 --> 16:21.840]  just two days ago, he's had a bunch of surgeries, and you people are so evil you go out and
[16:21.840 --> 16:29.480]  demonstrate and boo and hiss when people call for his recovery, that's who you are and
[16:29.480 --> 16:34.480]  you're running your mouths, you live in the lap of luxury, you run around acting tough
[16:34.480 --> 16:43.320]  and cool all day and you have no idea, no idea, no idea, that goes for David Brock and
[16:43.320 --> 16:47.960]  all the rest of these people, we're aware of their operations, we're aware of their
[16:47.960 --> 16:55.760]  productions, we're aware of all the different things they're up to and now the doctors,
[16:55.760 --> 17:02.240]  the scientists, the engineers, the surgeons have got their scalpels and their sutures
[17:02.240 --> 17:07.080]  and their instruments out and they're just deciding right now over the patient how much
[17:07.080 --> 17:13.680]  has to get cut out and can the patient even live, but I will assure you in that process
[17:13.680 --> 17:19.840]  of that delicate surgery that you're going to get everything your evil little butts ever
[17:19.840 --> 17:23.960]  wanted and I take no pleasure in that, I think it's pretty clear you're going to start a
[17:23.960 --> 17:29.640]  civil war, in fact I think it's clear we've eased into one and that's how a lot of wars,
[17:29.640 --> 17:33.400]  a lot of civil wars start is you never really have a demarcation line, you don't have a
[17:33.400 --> 17:38.760]  shot heard around the world like we had in 1775, you just kind of slip into the lawlessness
[17:38.760 --> 17:45.880]  and you guys are sowing the wind and you know what happens then, you sow the wind, you reap
[17:45.880 --> 17:54.000]  the whirlwind and most of you can hardly talk, you can hardly walk, it's like I was watching
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.800]  this morning, I saw a clip of the wall, the music video from Pink Floyd and it shows the
[17:59.800 --> 18:04.640]  kids going into the school normal and they come out as little zombies and they're just
[18:04.640 --> 18:09.600]  fed into a meat grinder, so first they dehumanize you then they feed you into a meat grinder
[18:09.600 --> 18:16.800]  and that's exactly how all of this works and so you're now calling it a civil war, you're
[18:16.800 --> 18:21.160]  saying you want an insurrection, you're saying you want to hunt Trump supporters, you're
[18:21.160 --> 18:27.320]  saying you want to bomb things, you're saying Trump's a dictator but you've got your elite
[18:27.320 --> 18:31.120]  publications calling for his overthrow and how they're going to have a new elections
[18:31.120 --> 18:36.760]  run by Obama's old homeland security and now you're going to take our guns and you're
[18:36.760 --> 18:41.240]  going to shut the press off once and for all and you're going to start with Alex Jones,
[18:41.240 --> 18:46.720]  good luck, really good luck with all of that fools, the minute you try to actually shut
[18:46.720 --> 18:54.320]  us down completely, you take us from powerful to incredibly powerful, you turn us into martyrs,
[18:54.320 --> 18:59.600]  you take us to the next level, you can't win to quote episode four Star Wars, you strike
[18:59.600 --> 19:06.040]  us down, we become more powerful than you can possibly imagine, that's history, that's
[19:06.040 --> 19:12.400]  art imitating life, not life imitating art, that's the truth, we have the upper hand as
[19:12.400 --> 19:16.980]  long as we're moral, as long as we're focused, as long as we have courage and as long as
[19:16.980 --> 19:21.760]  we don't back down to you people, you're going to lose, it's not like Korea where you set
[19:21.760 --> 19:25.120]  up a dictatorship where people never had freedom for thousands of years and we're a
[19:25.120 --> 19:33.520]  hermitage controlled vice system of China under vassal control, it's not like you're
[19:33.520 --> 19:38.720]  coming out of the Orthodox Christian and then the czars and some of the oppressions in Russia
[19:38.720 --> 19:43.720]  into something even worse, the whole world coming out of globalism, the renaissance
[19:43.720 --> 19:50.200]  is spreading and this is only the birth pains of that, but that renaissance is humanity
[19:50.200 --> 19:57.360]  getting its feet on the ground before we face the AI and the antichrist, so all this stuff
[19:57.360 --> 19:58.920]  you see is just testing.
[19:58.920 --> 20:04.360]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and republican presidential candidate, I love
[20:04.360 --> 20:08.360]  these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables
[20:08.360 --> 20:12.920]  that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards, we all look forward to
[20:12.920 --> 20:17.240]  garden tomatoes and corn on the cob, don't you wish there was a better way to preserve
[20:17.240 --> 20:21.840]  their true taste and flavors, I'm here to tell you that there is a better way, it's
[20:21.840 --> 20:27.360]  by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right, I have a Harvest Right freeze
[20:27.360 --> 20:32.520]  dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love, strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and
[20:32.520 --> 20:38.080]  ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years and the best part of my freeze drying is my family
[20:38.080 --> 20:43.240]  and I have a supply of long lasting food on hand, so no matter what may come, we feel
[20:43.240 --> 20:46.280]  better prepared, we love our freeze dryer.

[21:58.280 --> 22:03.640]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance.

[22:28.160 --> 22:29.880]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[22:29.880 --> 22:34.680]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[22:34.680 --> 22:38.360]  I buy some, I use some, I store some, awesome.
[22:38.360 --> 22:43.000]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life, NASA PAC technology.

[22:58.000 --> 23:02.560]  It's been said any society has only three missed meals away from chaos.
[23:02.560 --> 23:04.120]  Those times may be near.
[23:04.120 --> 23:05.120]  Think about it.
[23:05.120 --> 23:09.800]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[23:09.800 --> 23:14.600]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[23:14.600 --> 23:18.400]  And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term allergies
[23:18.400 --> 23:20.400]  from a single cyber attack.
[23:20.400 --> 23:24.600]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide
[23:24.600 --> 23:27.160]  during a widespread national emergency.
[23:27.160 --> 23:30.160]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[23:30.160 --> 23:32.920]  That's where my Patriot supply comes in.

[24:06.000 --> 24:12.320]  The keeps on raining, love is going to break, and when the levee breaks, have no place to
[24:12.320 --> 24:13.320]  stay.
[24:13.320 --> 24:20.720]  Going down, going down to Chicago, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[24:20.720 --> 24:24.040]  I'm going to get into the big, deep state news more on Johnny Dapp, what's happening
[24:24.040 --> 24:25.040]  in the economy.
[24:25.040 --> 24:28.760]  The Democrats going into full panic mode the next segment, but right now, look at the type
[24:28.760 --> 24:29.760]  of articles.
[24:29.760 --> 24:30.760]  They're just handing me in real time.
[24:30.760 --> 24:35.600]  This is out of Medusa magazine, which is a feminist magazine.
[24:35.600 --> 24:38.080]  That's not a joke.
[24:38.080 --> 24:43.000]  Beyond pro-choice, the solution to white supremacy is white abortion, and it says, if you get
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.280]  pregnant with a white man, abort it and adopt a black baby.
[24:46.280 --> 24:47.960]  Whites are inherently evil.
[24:47.960 --> 24:49.600]  People think, oh, this is just some French thing.
[24:49.600 --> 24:54.800]  This is taught at every major college in America.
[24:54.800 --> 25:01.800]  This is the operating system by white professors, mainly.
[25:01.800 --> 25:05.800]  And then you get a professor like Weinstein at Evergreen, who's a biology professor, and
[25:05.800 --> 25:12.080]  says, look, I'm a big liberal, but you can't ban whites from the school for a day.
[25:12.080 --> 25:14.720]  If you want to walk off campus, that's one thing.
[25:14.720 --> 25:15.720]  That's racism.
[25:15.720 --> 25:20.360]  And now they want him basically dead, the college is shut down, and Joe Rogan says,
[25:20.360 --> 25:22.600]  why is the left attacking itself?
[25:22.600 --> 25:24.480]  Because it's a weapons system.
[25:24.480 --> 25:25.800]  We have all the white papers.
[25:25.800 --> 25:27.800]  We have all the documents.
[25:27.800 --> 25:30.800]  We've gone over them at nauseam here.
[25:30.800 --> 25:34.120]  This is a planned program.
[25:34.120 --> 25:35.440]  It's working.
[25:35.440 --> 25:36.440]  It's standardized.
[25:36.440 --> 25:37.680]  It's not just at Evergreen.
[25:37.680 --> 25:38.680]  It's everywhere.
[25:38.680 --> 25:43.400]  And then this, news roundup, Obama says Senate healthcare bill has meanness at its core, even
[25:43.400 --> 25:48.040]  though it's got too much spending and too much largesse and will bankrupt us, it's not
[25:48.040 --> 25:52.520]  as bad as Obamacare.
[25:52.520 --> 25:58.440]  We are being driven towards collapse by design because the globalist are tax exempt offshore
[25:58.440 --> 25:59.640]  and want to consolidate.
[25:59.640 --> 26:01.320]  That's their system.
[26:01.320 --> 26:03.960]  It's worse.
[26:03.960 --> 26:10.280]  The lion of London Bridge, the hero that fought off the three men that had already stabbed
[26:10.280 --> 26:13.600]  to death a bunch of people, he decided to fight one man.
[26:13.600 --> 26:19.240]  They stabbed him, what was like 14 times in the neck all over.
[26:19.240 --> 26:24.120]  He said FU, this is London, I guess there's one man left.
[26:24.120 --> 26:28.640]  He is homeless while migrants secure luxury housing.
[26:28.640 --> 26:29.640]  That's right.
[26:29.640 --> 26:34.320]  The Muslims, the new thing is to burn down their government issued high rises, like four
[26:34.320 --> 26:38.440]  or five of them are burned down and then the left was waiting, then they go and they are
[26:38.440 --> 26:46.040]  recording, they are basically stealing, they are grabbing, they are taking control of confiscating
[26:46.040 --> 26:50.840]  people's private homes saying, oh, you have two houses, so you don't need this flat.
[26:50.840 --> 26:54.880]  We're going to put migrants in it just like they've done in Germany, just like they've
[26:54.880 --> 26:55.880]  done in Italy.
[26:55.880 --> 27:01.400]  We have the videos of a little in owner, 80 something years old with 20 rooms on the sea
[27:01.400 --> 27:06.280]  in Italy and they go, here's the African migrants that just landed.
[27:06.280 --> 27:10.640]  He kicks the guy's guest out, he's crying, you're not going to be compensated, they live
[27:10.640 --> 27:13.680]  here now.
[27:13.680 --> 27:18.320]  It's about seeing how much they can rub your nose in it.
[27:18.320 --> 27:23.320]  Polish MP, schools, BBC host on refugees, how many terror attacks have you had in London?
[27:23.320 --> 27:26.120]  Hundreds and hundreds, they've had none in Poland.
[27:26.120 --> 27:30.320]  That's all coming up and I'm going to play this powerful piece that deals with how they're
[27:30.320 --> 27:33.800]  trying to start a civil war and how we're already entered one.
[27:33.800 --> 27:39.600]  Mr. Calendars, with Congressman Scalise getting shot a week and a half ago, what date was
[27:39.600 --> 27:40.600]  that, please, folks?
[27:40.600 --> 27:42.920]  Look that up for me, because I was really thinking about this this morning and last
[27:42.920 --> 27:43.920]  night.
[27:43.920 --> 27:49.680]  That's when the civil war went from a cold civil war, a culture war, a bullying war,
[27:49.680 --> 27:54.640]  a leftist temper tantrum, stabbing, shooting, killing, burning a few people to targeting
[27:54.640 --> 28:02.360]  Congress and then the media, Wolf Blitzer and others and Democrat operative saying,
[28:02.360 --> 28:06.800]  not Republicans, too bad this wasn't more coordinated, this is when they fully bought
[28:06.800 --> 28:07.800]  into it.
[28:07.800 --> 28:12.080]  Because you can go back, you know, three years ago, two years ago, the case for rioting Newsweek,
[28:12.080 --> 28:13.920]  you can find all those articles.
[28:13.920 --> 28:19.160]  But now it's official, they've decided they're going to put their boots on, they're going
[28:19.160 --> 28:23.400]  to load up their firearms, their clips, and they're going to march out and start killing
[28:23.400 --> 28:24.400]  people.
[28:24.400 --> 28:28.560]  All I'm going to say is, like Colonel Jackson said, don't fire until you see the whites
[28:28.560 --> 28:30.080]  of their eyes.
[28:30.080 --> 28:34.280]  Quite frankly, we can just hold and keep letting them kill us.
[28:34.280 --> 28:36.400]  I'm sorry for those of you that get killed.
[28:36.400 --> 28:38.400]  And don't respond offensively.
[28:38.400 --> 28:40.000]  We're winning the Info War with us right now.
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.240]  In fact, if I was the globalist, I would have already staged some false flags.
[28:43.240 --> 28:46.440]  They just know law enforcement and others are pretty much on our side and are watching
[28:46.440 --> 28:47.440]  every move.
[28:47.440 --> 28:52.000]  So it's hard for the globalist to run false flags now.
[28:52.000 --> 28:56.120]  So as police was shot June 14th, I'd say that's the shot heard around the world.
[28:56.120 --> 28:59.680]  I mean, you could argue we were already in a civil war before that and they're calling
[28:59.680 --> 29:03.240]  for violence and killing the president, his family, and every major publication and for
[29:03.240 --> 29:07.480]  overthrowing the government and arresting me and we're all Russian agents, anybody that
[29:07.480 --> 29:14.280]  stands up for America, you're a Russian agent, they're the globalist agents and they know
[29:14.280 --> 29:15.280]  it.
[29:15.280 --> 29:21.680]  But June 14th, Nebraska Democratic official Alston for allegedly wishing Steve Khalees
[29:21.680 --> 29:22.680]  to die.
[29:22.680 --> 29:27.480]  USA Today, they are fawning, they are frothing, they are foaming.
[29:27.480 --> 29:31.680]  Two days ago said Congressman Khalees, our prayers go to him, the police officers and
[29:31.680 --> 29:32.680]  others that were shot.
[29:32.680 --> 29:33.680]  Boo!
[29:33.680 --> 29:34.680]  No!
[29:34.680 --> 29:37.680]  We'll be dying!
[29:37.680 --> 29:39.680]  Tell you it's sick.
[29:39.680 --> 29:46.200]  We're going to be right back with this incredibly powerful piece that Darren McBreen has put
[29:46.200 --> 29:47.200]  together.
[29:47.200 --> 29:48.200]  I'm Alex Jones.
[29:48.200 --> 29:49.200]  Please stay with us.
[29:49.200 --> 29:50.200]  We're on the march.
[29:50.200 --> 29:52.600]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:52.600 --> 29:59.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.600 --> 30:03.840]  Donald Trump just held a rally in Iowa and one of the people in attendance, our anonymous
[30:03.840 --> 30:05.360]  sources say, was Bill Clinton.
[30:05.360 --> 30:06.960]  Well, how do we know it was Bill Clinton?
[30:06.960 --> 30:10.000]  Because while Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Khalees
[30:10.000 --> 30:13.840]  and the other three Americans who were shot at the ball field by a deranged Bernie supporter,
[30:13.840 --> 30:16.680]  Democratic operatives began blowing their Bill Clinton rape whistles.
[30:16.680 --> 30:22.960]  I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous
[30:22.960 --> 30:27.320]  friend, somebody that I've gotten to know very well, Steve Khalees.
[30:27.320 --> 30:28.320]  Right?
[30:28.320 --> 30:30.920]  Because that's the only reason you would try to interrupt a president as he was sending
[30:30.920 --> 30:33.640]  out his thoughts and prayers to somebody who had recently been shot.
[30:33.640 --> 30:34.640]  Right?
[30:34.640 --> 30:35.640]  Come on, work with me here.
[30:35.640 --> 30:37.200]  The Democrats can't even protest right.
[30:37.200 --> 30:38.360]  These people fail at everything.
[30:38.360 --> 30:42.400]  They lose elections, they lose public support, and now they look like thoughtless cowards.
[30:42.400 --> 30:44.080]  It's just as Trump said.
[30:44.080 --> 30:45.080]  Never fails.
[30:45.080 --> 30:49.680]  You can check out the video on Infowars.com.
[30:49.680 --> 30:53.680]  Protesters blow whistles as Trump sends thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Khalees.
[30:53.680 --> 30:56.440]  And that part about Bill Clinton being in the audience, that was fake news.
[30:56.440 --> 30:59.400]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[30:59.400 --> 31:01.240]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[31:01.240 --> 31:03.280]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:03.280 --> 31:06.160]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:06.160 --> 31:12.200]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:12.200 --> 31:17.160]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[31:17.160 --> 31:22.120]  Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[31:22.120 --> 31:27.240]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[31:27.240 --> 31:28.960]  you can to purify your air.
[31:28.960 --> 31:33.960]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:33.960 --> 31:39.160]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves, the general public doesn't.
[31:39.160 --> 31:43.120]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:43.120 --> 31:46.720]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:46.720 --> 31:50.280]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[31:50.280 --> 31:53.480]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:53.480 --> 31:58.440]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.

[33:02.800 --> 33:08.360]  You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future, not a future
[33:08.360 --> 33:11.400]  that will be, but one that might be.
[33:11.400 --> 33:17.360]  This is not a new world, it is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[33:17.360 --> 33:22.160]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of
[33:22.160 --> 33:25.800]  a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[33:25.800 --> 33:32.400]  It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction
[33:32.400 --> 33:34.520]  of human freedom.
[33:34.520 --> 33:40.480]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[33:40.480 --> 33:47.840]  Logic is an enemy, and truth is a menace.
[33:47.840 --> 33:53.240]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth, in his last 48 hours on earth.
[33:53.240 --> 33:57.960]  He's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated, because he is built
[33:57.960 --> 34:02.040]  out of flesh, and because he has a mind.
[34:02.040 --> 34:07.800]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[34:07.800 --> 34:16.560]  The Twilight Zone that is authoritarianism, the wicked altar that so many have worshipped
[34:16.560 --> 34:20.360]  throughout history, it always behaves the same, it always acts the same, it's not based
[34:20.360 --> 34:25.800]  on creativity or open society and freedom, it's based on tyranny and oppression and death.
[34:25.800 --> 34:31.920]  And now that very system is here, masquerading as liberalism, masquerading as the arts, masquerading
[34:31.920 --> 34:38.320]  when it's a weapons system, Johnny Depp from Kentucky, posing like he's British in every
[34:38.320 --> 34:45.080]  major movie he's in, with a fake accent in England, running down our president and hoping
[34:45.080 --> 34:48.840]  he dies.
[34:48.840 --> 34:53.240]  And if somebody kills Johnny Depp, which I hope doesn't happen, or one of these other
[34:53.240 --> 35:01.000]  Hollywood turds, the media won't ever point out that they call for violence, or Wolf Blitzer
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.400]  as a guest on, says, oh, I knew the guy that did this, he wasn't evil, he was just upset
[35:04.400 --> 35:06.960]  about politics, he was a nice guy.
[35:06.960 --> 35:15.400]  Well, Blitzer took it like it was a statement he agreed with, cut to his panel, and all
[35:15.400 --> 35:21.720]  over the news, to the Washington Post, the New York Times, to the Huffington Post, they're
[35:21.720 --> 35:27.840]  out there hoping the president dies and saying, too bad, this was so uncoordinated, and he
[35:27.840 --> 35:34.120]  didn't know how to use the firearm properly, too bad he can only, you know, shoot two cops
[35:34.120 --> 35:38.920]  and almost kill them and almost kill the congressman, almost kill another person, you know, too
[35:38.920 --> 35:39.920]  bad.
[35:39.920 --> 35:52.840]  Johnny Depp, what a drugged out, fried brain idiot, let's run that clip one more time of
[35:52.840 --> 35:56.840]  somebody that wants to run his mouth, and just because the word's gone out, call for
[35:56.840 --> 36:00.280]  violence, call for violence, start the civil war, start the civil war, if there's a real
[36:00.280 --> 36:05.520]  hot civil war, which we're sliding into, bro, we're already in one, we're sliding down,
[36:05.520 --> 36:10.840]  I will assure you, you're going to be held responsible, and your publicist and others
[36:10.840 --> 36:17.480]  that have pushed you to do this, you're trying to organize massive bloodshed and killing
[36:17.480 --> 36:24.360]  and crimes, and you're using your platform to do it, and you will be held accountable.
[36:24.360 --> 36:28.480]  I love how I cover The New York Times, The Washington Post, singing in, when there's
[36:28.480 --> 36:34.480]  all these Podesta emails about wiener and child porn, you know, wiener, and trying to procure
[36:34.480 --> 36:41.520]  young girls, teenagers, we break that, Eric Prince breaks it, Breitbart breaks it, all
[36:41.520 --> 36:48.800]  the same 24 hours, we get no credit, then the media focuses on a pizza place that does
[36:48.800 --> 36:55.600]  have Podesta and others going to it, they make it all about the pizza place, the code words,
[36:55.600 --> 37:00.840]  the FBI, cheese pizza, child porn, that's used worldwide, they focus on that as a honey
[37:00.840 --> 37:12.760]  pot, as a decoy, and then the news says, oh, Jones, he made a guy that had been his listener,
[37:12.760 --> 37:18.440]  go in there and do it, Alex told him to go be violent, which I never said, but see, I'm
[37:18.440 --> 37:23.120]  guilty of some guy going and supposedly shooting a hole in the roof, that witnesses that were
[37:23.120 --> 37:26.320]  there that interviewed said they didn't hear a gunshot, they didn't see it happen, but
[37:26.320 --> 37:31.200]  the DC police, the same ones that, you know, let crowds of folks attack Trump supporters
[37:31.200 --> 37:36.400]  at the inauguration, and the DC police involved, and all the stuff we've seen, they say it
[37:36.400 --> 37:43.440]  happened, and then a guy who was an actor on an already felony plea deal in another
[37:43.440 --> 37:50.520]  state comes, and this happens at the pizza place, and it's all my fault, almost a month
[37:50.520 --> 37:55.720]  after I said, drop the story, it's a decoy, before the press ever targeted me and ever
[37:55.720 --> 38:01.160]  said I was the author of it, but I figured out they were going to do it, and that what
[38:01.160 --> 38:06.240]  was being reported by the press wasn't accurate, we pulled back on it, so we become the authors
[38:06.240 --> 38:11.120]  of it, we become who's behind it, we become the devil that wants violence, when we're
[38:11.120 --> 38:16.240]  the ones saying never be violent offensively, treat the second of them with great respect
[38:16.240 --> 38:20.720]  as you do the first, we're not the ones running around saying kill everybody, we're not the
[38:20.720 --> 38:25.920]  ones saying bomb Trump tower, like MSNBC is, we're not the ones saying he's a suicide
[38:25.920 --> 38:30.120]  bomber at the same time, we're not the ones saying Trump's a dictator, we're not the ones
[38:30.120 --> 38:34.360]  saying kill, kill, kill, kill this person, kill that person, but what's Johnny Depp going
[38:34.360 --> 38:41.520]  to do, if somebody who isn't an actor like him, somebody who doesn't just talk, kills
[38:41.520 --> 38:47.320]  him, they're going to turn it into how the horrible right wing did this and that, they're
[38:47.320 --> 38:52.440]  eliciting, their fans getting killed, their minions, their zombies, that they're out there
[38:52.440 --> 38:57.880]  on these huge platforms saying do the right thing, go kill Trump or kill his supporters,
[38:57.880 --> 39:03.720]  hey white boy, get ready to be shanked, you're wearing a Trump hat, it's political intimidation
[39:03.720 --> 39:09.280]  and it's not working for them, so what are they going to do next, they're going to get
[39:09.280 --> 39:12.840]  more hysterical and they're going to push more and more and almost all of them like
[39:12.840 --> 39:19.720]  Mika Brzezinski and everybody, have never gotten their feet wet, they've never gotten
[39:19.720 --> 39:25.280]  their hands dirty, no, Scarborough, a little bit different there, these guys are hands
[39:25.280 --> 39:30.200]  dirty a couple times, we can go bull right there, little pumpkin heads, it's like Mars
[39:30.200 --> 39:34.280]  is a taxi, aliens wearing a wig because the head's really so big, it's really a great
[39:34.280 --> 39:38.520]  alien from Mars, I think Scarborough might be one of them, I'm joking, but he does have
[39:38.520 --> 39:44.160]  like a Martian head, I mean, good God imagine if he shaved that thing, he's got a Martian
[39:44.160 --> 39:52.480]  head, but getting back to the famous mass murderer's daughter, Brzezinski, she's saying,
[39:52.480 --> 39:59.840]  Mika is saying that he's developing a dictatorship, no, we're removing the face-sucking
[39:59.840 --> 40:06.000]  cancer, we're removing you, so you sit there in your ivory tower with all your billions
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.720]  of dollars daddy got and you sit up there just imagining you're in some existential
[40:10.720 --> 40:16.280]  war with the horrible coal miners and the horrible ranchers and the horrible policemen
[40:16.280 --> 40:20.480]  and the horrible air traffic controllers and the horrible mechanics and the horrible soldiers
[40:20.480 --> 40:25.040]  and you just imagine how you're the hyper elite, you're the intellectual, you go to
[40:25.040 --> 40:30.080]  the white tie and black tie events, you perch up on top of us and you're gonna teach us
[40:30.080 --> 40:33.720]  culture and you're gonna make our children grow up the way you want our kids to grow
[40:33.720 --> 40:37.200]  up, you're gonna run our lives, let me tell you something, just like Starbucks called
[40:37.200 --> 40:42.580]  for the Islamic invaders to all be given jobs and tries to turn their thing into political
[40:42.580 --> 40:46.800]  correctness situation to sit there and re-educate everybody when they come to Starbucks, they
[40:46.800 --> 40:53.120]  have been precipitously, they're stock dropping, their purchases dropping, their revenue dropping,
[40:53.120 --> 40:58.480]  like 25%, it's still going down, they're in total panic mode, removing executives and
[40:58.480 --> 41:03.520]  none of it's right in the ship, Starbucks pissed on too many people and there was no
[41:03.520 --> 41:10.560]  official boycott ever launched, everyone just said you know what, I'm gonna go out of my
[41:10.560 --> 41:16.680]  way, not to make Starbucks, I'm gonna ask at a hotel and if the coffee is Starbucks,
[41:16.680 --> 41:22.240]  I'm not gonna drink it at breakfast, I will not, I go to hotels now and if they've got
[41:22.240 --> 41:28.280]  Starbucks, I don't even have coffee or I'm asking now, when I book a hotel, do you have
[41:28.280 --> 41:34.400]  Starbucks and most of them do and I go, I'm not booking with your hotel, click and you
[41:34.400 --> 41:40.760]  know that it's put in the computer, it's war, they need us, not the other way around, they
[41:40.760 --> 41:48.440]  hate you, they hate your family, you understand that and of course the CEO had to step down,
[41:48.440 --> 41:52.360]  that's an example, they always want to boycott us, they always want to bully us, they always
[41:52.360 --> 41:57.680]  want to get in our face, no, we're done, now before I play this powerful report, this
[41:57.680 --> 42:01.520]  boil down by Darren McBrain that we're also gonna post on infowars.com, I want to ask
[42:01.520 --> 42:05.720]  folks listening on AM and FM stations and people watching us on cable systems around
[42:05.720 --> 42:11.720]  the country and folks watching on the streams at infowars.com, and folks watching us at
[42:11.720 --> 42:15.560]  presentplanet.tv, the members of that that help pay it forward for everybody else and
[42:15.560 --> 42:18.840]  they get all the documentary films and the rest of it and people watching on Facebook
[42:18.840 --> 42:28.120]  and YouTube and on Twitter, on Periscope, share that link, retweet that link, tweet it
[42:28.120 --> 42:34.040]  at Globalist, tweet it at Hillary, tweet it at the UN, tweet it at them, fight their
[42:34.040 --> 42:39.320]  algorithms, fight their propaganda, human, human action will rip their arms out of their
[42:39.320 --> 42:45.040]  political sockets, crush them, roll over them, when you're sitting there at lunch or you're
[42:45.040 --> 42:47.760]  sitting there at night, it doesn't matter when you do it, during a rebroadcast, when
[42:47.760 --> 42:52.000]  I'm live, when you're watching on YouTube later, send out the article, send out the
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.280]  video, send out the videos you think are the most important, send out the articles you
[42:55.280 --> 43:02.120]  think are the most informative, it's an info war, you are the power, come together, realize
[43:02.120 --> 43:06.080]  the globalists are desperate, they're losing, they know it, we're already gone into the
[43:06.080 --> 43:10.360]  beginnings of a civil war, we're trying to right the ship, we don't want it to get physical,
[43:10.360 --> 43:15.840]  but now is the time to intensify information warfare operations using our secret weapon,
[43:15.840 --> 43:20.280]  the truth, more than ever, so I salute you and I thank you for your support, that you're

[43:38.400 --> 43:42.920]  you know, can put it at their business or wherever, get aggressive, realize we're turning
[43:42.920 --> 43:47.800]  the tide, but they want to bully us into submission, so everybody shuts up about their views and
[43:47.800 --> 43:52.600]  rolls over to this authoritarian takeover, this is not the time to be bullied, this is
[43:52.600 --> 43:57.240]  the time to redouble because they're trying to bully, and the good news is they're losing
[43:57.240 --> 44:02.760]  and they're failing, and it's good to be able to say that, and it's because so many of you
[44:02.760 --> 44:06.880]  over the decades worked so hard to get the word out, now briefly before I go to this
[44:06.880 --> 44:13.280]  point, before the July summer mega special is running, help us defend free speech, infowarsstore.com,

[45:31.800 --> 45:37.040]  shirt today at infowarsstore.com, now let's go ahead and go to this incredibly important
[45:37.040 --> 45:43.320]  report dealing with the deep state and how to combat it by Darren McBrain, criminal elements
[45:43.320 --> 45:47.080]  inside the government, the deep state are working with the media with fake news and
[45:47.080 --> 45:54.880]  fake leaks to try to undermine Trump's recovery, that's really the big news.
[45:54.880 --> 46:00.200]  A soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to
[46:00.200 --> 46:07.080]  overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office,
[46:07.080 --> 46:12.680]  sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind a clear and present
[46:12.680 --> 46:13.680]  danger.
[46:13.680 --> 46:20.200]  When you see leaders on the left calling for essentially rising up and they allow for
[46:20.200 --> 46:24.320]  Antifa to do all the violence that they do and then you have to be heading at the president
[46:24.320 --> 46:29.720]  virtually by Kathy Griffith and this play where the President Trump is killed, you have
[46:29.720 --> 46:33.920]  a certain percentage of the population who's going to buy into that will become completely
[46:33.920 --> 46:37.120]  decentralized, become completely radicalized and act.
[46:37.120 --> 46:43.520]  A gunman opened fire when members of Congress and their staffs.
[46:43.520 --> 46:48.160]  In the hours after five people were shot, including the House Majority Whip, you sent
[46:48.160 --> 46:53.640]  a tweet that said, hunt Republicans, I mean it was clearly a reference to the assassination
[46:53.640 --> 46:58.800]  attempt against Congressman Scalise, it's hard to imagine how you could justify writing
[46:58.800 --> 46:59.800]  something like that.
[46:59.800 --> 47:04.920]  For too long, Republicans in this country have failed to distinguish the differences
[47:04.920 --> 47:10.040]  between politics and war and a lot of Democrats have failed to see the similarities, so you
[47:10.040 --> 47:13.280]  guys either have to tone down the rhetoric or we have to step up.
[47:13.280 --> 47:18.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have so much proof of the Democrats saying overthrow Trump,
[47:18.080 --> 47:23.000]  UCOG, killing, kill his supporters, cancel the last election, remove the Republicans
[47:23.000 --> 47:28.000]  that were elected in the last 2016 election, I mean I've got the mainstream articles here
[47:28.000 --> 47:29.000]  where they're pushing it.
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.960]  Here in America, we're at a turning point tonight with forces now forming an alliance
[47:32.960 --> 47:36.200]  to try and remove President Trump from office, it's that serious.
[47:36.200 --> 47:42.080]  The left wing media is out to get him, they are out to nullify an election for the first
[47:42.080 --> 47:43.080]  time.
[47:43.080 --> 47:48.960]  America is now suffering from a massive informational crisis because I call them the destroy Trump
[47:48.960 --> 47:56.760]  media has routinely been exposed now, agenda driven, propagandist, more than happy to push,
[47:56.760 --> 47:59.400]  debunked, tinfoil hat conspiracy theories.
[47:59.400 --> 48:07.480]  Sean Hannity is currently the main leader of the resistance against the globalist outside
[48:07.480 --> 48:13.680]  of Trump and then of course myself, but I am more grassroots and I'm more front line
[48:13.680 --> 48:18.600]  being demonized, being attacked, it's my job to get the intel out, to take the main attack,
[48:18.600 --> 48:22.360]  to draw the enemy fire so that we understand exactly what we're dealing with.
[48:22.360 --> 48:28.720]  You've got the destroy Trump media that has been lying to you now, provable lies for 11
[48:28.720 --> 48:33.800]  months, nonstop, Trump, Russia collusion, no evidence whatsoever.
[48:33.800 --> 48:39.760]  The Russians in my opinion could not have known how best to weaponize that information
[48:39.760 --> 48:48.320]  unless they had been guided and they began to have some of their allies within the internet
[48:48.320 --> 48:55.040]  world like info wars, take out pieces and begin to say the most outrageous, outlandish,
[48:55.040 --> 48:58.000]  absurd lies you can imagine.
[48:58.000 --> 49:06.520]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Rupley and then I think you have them feeding other
[49:06.520 --> 49:10.920]  entities, info wars comes to mind where those are echo chambers.
[49:10.920 --> 49:18.480]  The way that the left is going about trying to demonize the president, essentially justify
[49:18.480 --> 49:27.280]  and ignore the violence on their side and then reinforce that with a complete, the imagery
[49:27.280 --> 49:33.000]  of death being acceptable, a captive rip is fusing the beheaded image of the president.
[49:33.000 --> 49:38.360]  All these things are the same way ISIS goes about radicalizing and recruiting people to
[49:38.360 --> 49:39.360]  become terrorists.
[49:39.360 --> 49:43.600]  This is unprecedented, to have a president that behaves this way, can anyone go back
[49:43.600 --> 49:44.600]  in history?
[49:44.600 --> 49:50.040]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[49:50.040 --> 49:54.560]  It's a sad day when you cannot depend on the president's word and my advice would just
[49:54.560 --> 49:58.720]  be to Republicans who do cozy up to him, it's just like hugging a suicide bomber.
[49:58.720 --> 50:01.040]  He's not a doctor, he's a bully and he's a bitch.
[50:01.040 --> 50:04.960]  He's a punk, he's a dog, he's a pig.
[50:04.960 --> 50:09.440]  He's a con, a bullshit artist, a mutt.
[50:09.440 --> 50:13.640]  I'll meet him in a hotel room any other day of the week and give him a Louisville slugger.
[50:13.640 --> 50:15.280]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[50:15.280 --> 50:20.280]  Kiss my mother as you bitch punk, sucker.
[50:20.280 --> 50:27.680]  They're a bunch of scum that just hate America.
[50:27.680 --> 50:29.480]  They're all a bunch of mentally ill nobodies.
[50:29.480 --> 50:33.040]  The image of President Donald Trump projected on a white board.
[50:33.040 --> 50:38.120]  They're a bunch of baiters that want war.
[50:38.120 --> 50:43.040]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[50:43.040 --> 50:51.840]  It's an actor dressed to look just like President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
[50:51.840 --> 50:56.800]  Pictures and video depicting comedian Cathy Griffin holding the bloody, decapitated head
[50:56.800 --> 51:00.440]  of President Trump are no joking matter for the Secret Service.
[51:00.440 --> 51:06.040]  A rhetoric that has inspired the violence has come from the mainstream of the Democratic
[51:06.040 --> 51:07.040]  Party.
[51:07.040 --> 51:33.040]  It evolved in the coup, an active attempt to start a bloody, civil war.
[51:33.040 --> 51:34.040]  Powerful peace.
[51:34.040 --> 51:38.040]  I know we're going to title that, but we should post it on Facebook and YouTube right now
[51:38.040 --> 51:47.840]  and everybody should get it out there, but headlines show this to everyone to stop leftist
[51:47.840 --> 51:53.480]  terror attacks or will the left stop their terror attacks in attempt to overthrow Trump?
[51:53.480 --> 52:00.960]  I mean, deep state promotes violence and terror to stop Trump.
[52:00.960 --> 52:05.920]  What do we do because we're in a position here where they're stabbing and shooting people
[52:05.920 --> 52:12.560]  every day, they're promoting death and destruction, they're allied with the most orthodox radical
[52:12.560 --> 52:19.440]  forms of Wahhabist Islam, they are spreading across the globe, they're violent attacks
[52:19.440 --> 52:24.760]  not just here but in other countries against nationalists, they are teaching the most hard
[52:24.760 --> 52:31.120]  core racist division garbage to weaponize the culture, it's incredible.
[52:31.120 --> 52:35.000]  The White House has put out a statement about Johnny Depp and we'll put that back up on
[52:35.000 --> 52:40.000]  screen if we get a chance, but this is a crescendo.
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.320]  This is all these big Hollywood stars, all these big rock stars that have their little
[52:44.320 --> 52:49.480]  mentally ill followers that don't live themselves but live through them who will now go out
[52:49.480 --> 52:50.480]  and carry out more violence.
[52:50.480 --> 52:56.720]  Notice it's intensifying as the summer arrives with massive Soros funding July 2nd for violence
[52:56.720 --> 52:59.000]  in the streets.
[52:59.000 --> 53:02.480]  White House statement, President Trump has condemned violence in all forms and it's
[53:02.480 --> 53:05.320]  said that others like Johnny Depp have not followed his lead.
[53:05.320 --> 53:11.040]  I hope that some of Mr. Depp's colleagues will speak out against this type of rhetoric.
[53:11.040 --> 53:19.320]  Well, maybe people like Kurt Russell, maybe people like Rick Linkletter, maybe people
[53:19.320 --> 53:26.840]  like Clint Eastwood, maybe folks like Bruce Willis, but those guys kind of come out every
[53:26.840 --> 53:30.360]  once in a while and just say something that makes sense about America and then like a
[53:30.360 --> 53:33.560]  turtle pull their head back in, you know, about telling Clint Eastwood what he should
[53:33.560 --> 53:37.320]  do but I know he served in Korea and a lot of the great things in this country but and
[53:37.320 --> 53:42.640]  I was a listener, Clint Eastwood should, I mean if he wants to fight for the country
[53:42.640 --> 53:47.760]  now more than ever, I wouldn't associate with people like Tom Hanks who needs you not the
[53:47.760 --> 53:48.760]  other way around.
[53:48.760 --> 53:53.240]  Tom Hanks is a globalist piece of filth, it's time to stop associating with them, I wouldn't
[53:53.240 --> 53:58.320]  be part of the whole Hollywood Combine, they need you not the other way around and I would
[53:58.320 --> 54:02.000]  come out and speak out about all this and we need Kurt Russell, who I know is super
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.240]  smart and I know is a listener of the show, to just come out and say this is wrong, this
[54:06.240 --> 54:07.920]  is cultic, this is out of control.
[54:07.920 --> 54:14.080]  James Woods, those on Fox like once every two years puts out a lot of great tweets,
[54:14.080 --> 54:18.720]  you can tell he's fighting for this country, we need James Woods, always love James Woods.
[54:18.720 --> 54:22.440]  It's funny like every actor ever really liked like Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, James Woods,
[54:22.440 --> 54:25.600]  I never really even know their politics growing up but those were the actors I liked, I didn't
[54:25.600 --> 54:29.680]  like Hollywood movies, Schwarzenegger I thought his movies were okay but you know he's a big
[54:29.680 --> 54:36.120]  liberal fake conservative, don't like Schwarzenegger but everybody I always instinctively liked
[54:36.120 --> 54:43.520]  it turned out was a patriot and but it's still all just make-believe and the reason we love
[54:43.520 --> 54:48.600]  these actors is that we were celebrating humanity and who they remind us of in our own
[54:48.600 --> 54:56.080]  lives, that's it but we don't live by watching that, we live by having our own lives, our
[54:56.080 --> 55:02.280]  own destiny and having wide-eyed wonderment in the universe and not just being purely
[55:02.280 --> 55:07.480]  competitive creatures but to be competitive to build a better world and to be strong and
[55:07.480 --> 55:12.120]  to say no to tyrants because most so-called competitive men join the power structure,
[55:12.120 --> 55:16.520]  they think that's competitive to amass more money for themselves while they sell out their
[55:16.520 --> 55:24.040]  own culture, real power, real manhood, real alpha leadership is bucking the trend, what
[55:24.040 --> 55:29.520]  is the right thing to do and not caring what the crowd says, you think I care when Hollywood
[55:29.520 --> 55:35.240]  scum attack me and when a pack of liars say I'm worthless and I'm evil and I'm bad, telling
[55:35.240 --> 55:43.000]  the truth to the face of tyranny is the true act of resistance, George Arwell said in a
[55:43.000 --> 55:49.240]  world of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act and that's so true
[55:49.240 --> 55:54.320]  today, so again all of you, the info wars listeners, you are why they hate info wars
[55:54.320 --> 56:01.400]  because you are diverse, you have diverse backgrounds, diverse ancestry, diverse culture,
[56:01.400 --> 56:05.920]  diverse religion but you know evil when you see it, you have a soul that wants to resist
[56:05.920 --> 56:12.800]  tyranny and they know you are tens upon tens upon tens of millions just in the US.
[56:12.800 --> 56:17.240]  I walk down the street now in Austin and every third person wants to shake my hand or get
[56:17.240 --> 56:23.520]  a photo, I walk down the street and hear people listening to me on their phones, they'll pull
[56:23.520 --> 56:27.200]  ear buds out and I'll just, and I'll be sitting next to a guy and he goes I'm just listening
[56:27.200 --> 56:34.040]  to you, then I walk outside and the person getting my car is listening, imagine if they
[56:34.040 --> 56:38.080]  took action, if they spread links, if they started their own podcast, if they called
[56:38.080 --> 56:42.760]  in a c-span, if they, whatever the case is, if they bought some of the products because
[56:42.760 --> 56:47.480]  only a fraction of the listeners are buying the super blue fluoride free game changing
[56:47.480 --> 56:52.520]  colloidal silver iodine toothpaste or the imrex essentials or X2 the good halogen that
[56:52.520 --> 56:56.800]  changed my life so much, but frankly I got really lazy taking it because it made me lose
[56:56.800 --> 57:01.040]  like 35 pounds on top of the 30 I'd lost, then I worked out a lot less so I'm starting
[57:01.040 --> 57:05.400]  to put a few back on because I mean it's just, it sped up my metabolic system and it's such
[57:05.400 --> 57:10.120]  a detoxifier, it's, it's, it's, most people are deficient, most the iodine in the environment
[57:10.120 --> 57:14.680]  you don't actually absorb, this you do, it's amazing, it's very powerful those consult
[57:14.680 --> 57:21.120]  your healthcare provider to your own research, survival shield X2 at infowarslife.com or
[57:21.120 --> 57:24.720]  call toll three triple eight two five three three one three nine and quite frankly I don't
[57:24.720 --> 57:28.920]  know how long we'll be able to get it from this rare earth crystal source quite frankly
[57:28.920 --> 57:32.480]  and there's other stuff going on so I might not, not even be able to, X2 might not exist
[57:32.480 --> 57:38.120]  in six months, I don't want to say that just to sell it, I'm not, I don't know if X2 quite
[57:38.120 --> 57:42.880]  frankly is going to be available, just going to be gone, we can go back to the old seaweed
[57:42.880 --> 57:47.400]  base, it's very pure, very clean but not as strong, but if you want X2 it's available
[57:47.400 --> 57:52.320]  infowarslife.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine and your purchase
[57:52.320 --> 57:57.720]  again, that's everything we do here possible, then again I'm wearing this t-shirt today,
[57:57.720 --> 58:02.280]  I thought because the civil war pretty much started I ought to just put on combat gear
[58:02.280 --> 58:07.200]  here metaphysically but also just to note that that's what it's all about ladies and
[58:07.200 --> 58:13.080]  gentlemen towards Washington with the Reeves around him honoring our great founder, all
[58:13.080 --> 58:19.240]  he did is an example against tyranny, then infowars.com over the heart and on the back

[58:50.760 --> 58:54.640]  The reason infowarslife has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want

[59:13.360 --> 59:18.240]  iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me, yeah I've actually just run out of
[59:18.240 --> 59:23.360]  my super female, I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting
[59:23.360 --> 59:30.240]  the gym once again, very exciting, feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair is
[59:30.240 --> 59:34.680]  luxurious once again so obviously the super female is amazing, I love it.
[59:34.680 --> 59:39.520]  Nascent iodine is essential, survival shield x2, if there's one product that I would say
[59:39.520 --> 59:44.400]  is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine survival shield x2, it's got
[59:44.400 --> 59:51.720]  a five star rating, it's a win win at infowarslife.com.
[59:51.720 --> 1:00:03.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:03.720 --> 1:00:06.120]  Man I am so thankful Trump.
[1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:13.160]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex
[1:00:13.160 --> 1:00:14.160]  Jones show.
[1:00:14.160 --> 1:00:20.240]  And I'm the big bad monster, I'm the big bad wolf, I'm the bad guy, so said the MSM that
[1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:24.760]  lies continually so I'm pretty honored, you know I say I'm synced with Trump, this is
[1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:32.080]  common sense, this morning I meant to open the show offering to campaign for Nancy Pelosi
[1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:36.200]  to stay in the speakership of the House of Representatives or she was previously that
[1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:38.440]  now she's the Democratic leader.
[1:00:38.440 --> 1:00:45.200]  I was going to campaign for her to remain the Democratic leader because obviously she's
[1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:51.000]  such a doddering corrupt, out of touch, loony tunes, piece of work, Democratic fundraisings
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.480]  at an all time low, they've thrown every bit of money they had in the last four special
[1:00:54.480 --> 1:00:59.760]  elections and failed and sure enough, POTUS made the same point, it would be very very
[1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:06.240]  sad day for Republicans if Nancy Pelosi steps down, says Trump, that's up on drudgerport.com,
[1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:12.120]  I want to post this on infowars.com, Trump meets with top CEOs, so we're going to get
[1:01:12.120 --> 1:01:19.240]  that video and play that for you, oh my gosh that is so delicious, so that's just some
[1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:24.320]  of the news that's up on, up on drudge, some of the other news, Johnny Depp jokes about
[1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:29.160]  Trump assassination, backlash, yeah I hope nobody kills him, I mean you know he is calling
[1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:34.040]  for civil war and murder, we're pushing it, part of the trend, 11th Hollywood star to
[1:01:34.040 --> 1:01:38.800]  imagine violence, yeah that's a good article, I'm going to go over that, MSNBC president
[1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:44.200]  like suicide bomber, further republican congressman attack threatened, I'm going to go over all
[1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:53.040]  those, update, Democratic official caught saying I'm glad, Scalise got shot, I mean
[1:01:53.040 --> 1:01:58.600]  that's what's going on, that's the trend for civil war, so we've got Pelosi, we've got
[1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:02.840]  President Trump saying keep her, but see I almost didn't want to come celebrate this
[1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:07.640]  because the Democrats might get wise and get rid of her, but see there's such a dictatorship
[1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:13.880]  of Schumer in the Senate and Pelosi in the House and then David Brock's like the brain
[1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:22.360]  that runs their operations and stuff and the skeletons all meet there and then come up
[1:02:22.360 --> 1:02:27.040]  with their battle plan and I just hope they just keep doing it, keep doing it, keep doing
[1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:32.160]  it, keep doing it and I know they got some big plans, I know deep state's got some plans,
[1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:38.280]  I understand that, but Soros they say he's kind of drifting off into oblivion right now
[1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:45.400]  and then Alex is the great new Titan, we have to deal with Alex Soros who, well let's just
[1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:51.760]  say he doesn't have as powerful a demon in him as his father, like he has like a slimer
[1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:56.920]  demon or something, he's got like a little, some kind of little goblin creature spirit,
[1:02:56.920 --> 1:03:02.680]  I mean we're talking about rat level creatures here, but what does it say about us if rat
[1:03:02.680 --> 1:03:11.080]  crazed, spirit cooking, Alistair Crowley loving little dweebies who've drank their own wimp
[1:03:11.080 --> 1:03:14.520]  Kool-Aid, they want to pull down the whole universe because they're such wimps, they're
[1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:19.080]  so ugly, they're so twisted, they want to pull everybody else down so they can feel
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:24.360]  powerful above it, it's not going to work that way, we've had so much prosperity dumbo's
[1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:31.600]  that people kind of tolerated you, they want to look at you, but now, now you will face
[1:03:31.600 --> 1:03:44.600]  the full fury, and I've been waiting for this a long time, now we're going to go to
[1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:49.080]  break soon and come back with Max Kaiser from Mexico City, and then I've got a powerful
[1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:52.200]  Joe Rogan Club I meant to get to yesterday that I've got to play about Evergreen College
[1:03:52.200 --> 1:03:57.360]  and the mental illness by design, and then I've got a powerful, when I say powerful,
[1:03:57.360 --> 1:04:04.080]  I'm not overusing the word, very important, poignant, thought provoking piece by George
[1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:09.760]  Carlin that I'd never heard with him on politics, political correctness and more, we're going
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:15.760]  to air both those this hour after Max Kaiser leaves us, if the water doesn't rise over
[1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:20.000]  Bear Creek or if the hair doesn't lip the admiral, they say oh don't use those old
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.520]  fashion British terms, it'll hurt someone with a hair lip, it's not meant to hurt someone
[1:04:23.520 --> 1:04:28.760]  with a hair lip, it's an old saying, and we've got to start using the old sayings where
[1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:32.280]  they're going to have a monopoly on words and tell us what words to use, it's total
[1:04:32.280 --> 1:04:38.000]  tyranny, it's control of language, it's out of control by design, and then Michael Malus,
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:43.800]  an expert on North Korea, the unauthorized biography on dear leader, that's the name
[1:04:43.800 --> 1:04:50.200]  of the book, we'll be joining us on the nightmare, I mean the heaven of the utopic communist
[1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:56.640]  country of North Korea, we'll also look at the implosion of other wonderlands like Cuba
[1:04:56.640 --> 1:04:58.960]  and Venezuela.
[1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:05.440]  Wow, you're going to love the latest idea out of the EU, Scott Keller, a German member
[1:05:05.440 --> 1:05:10.200]  of the European Parliament and of the Green Party, said we should transplant entire villages
[1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:14.880]  from Syria to Germany, and that would encourage more migrants to enter Germany, listen to
[1:05:14.880 --> 1:05:20.640]  these quotes, the idea of Syrian villages is only one possibility we can use, for example,
[1:05:20.640 --> 1:05:24.240]  if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees, people would
[1:05:24.240 --> 1:05:29.520]  rather go where compatriots already live, which makes integration and acceptance easier,
[1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:33.800]  let's look at these three compatriots, from Paul Joseph Watson, Sweden, migrants viciously
[1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:38.320]  beat disabled man while calling him racist, three compatriot refugees attempted to steal
[1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:42.240]  a homeless man's wallet in a train station during an incident which took place last month,
[1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:45.680]  the handicapped man was kicked and punched and received a vicious uppercut, as one of
[1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:50.120]  the migrants lectured him about war on Muslims and how all Swedes were racist, now how's
[1:05:50.120 --> 1:05:55.400]  that for acceptance, you can read both articles now on infowars.com, Rob Deer reporting for
[1:05:55.400 --> 1:05:59.400]  infowars.com and infowars nightly news.
[1:05:59.400 --> 1:06:03.760]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[1:06:03.760 --> 1:06:08.480]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[1:06:08.480 --> 1:06:14.160]  to detoxify the body, that's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense
[1:06:14.160 --> 1:06:20.060]  Support, it's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[1:06:20.060 --> 1:06:24.880]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war, it is a classical 360
[1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:29.280]  win, this is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we
[1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:34.560]  believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[1:06:34.560 --> 1:06:38.640]  get, you owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of
[1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:43.400]  this country and the world, that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused
[1:06:43.400 --> 1:06:48.920]  as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires
[1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:52.760]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be, thanks to your support and
[1:06:52.760 --> 1:06:56.560]  your prayers together, we're changing the world, now it's time to change our bodies
[1:06:56.560 --> 1:07:01.480]  with Z-Shield and infowarslife.com, Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread
[1:07:01.480 --> 1:07:06.880]  liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic
[1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:11.240]  coffee on the planet, for more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high
[1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:15.920]  mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica
[1:07:15.920 --> 1:07:20.880]  beans, we have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized
[1:07:20.880 --> 1:07:28.320]  blend, discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com,
[1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:32.840]  this coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and
[1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:36.800]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally, hands down this is my favorite
[1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:41.800]  coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican
[1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:45.960]  farmers, dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going
[1:07:45.960 --> 1:07:50.360]  to be disappointed, available in original or with our immune support infusion blend,
[1:07:50.360 --> 1:07:55.160]  you will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup
[1:07:55.160 --> 1:08:17.400]  of my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com from the front lines of the information war,
[1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:30.840]  this is Alex Jones, MSNBC's Alyssa Jordan, who was married to Michael Hastings, she
[1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:38.840]  was formerly on the top aid on the National Security Council for Obama, she is saying
[1:08:38.840 --> 1:08:44.720]  that Trump is like a suicide bomber, we have another MSNBC host saying ISIS should target
[1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:51.160]  Trump properties like Trump Tower, but he's violent, he's like a suicide bomber, that's
[1:08:51.160 --> 1:08:55.280]  coming up in a moment that Max Kaiser joins us from Mexico City with breaking news on
[1:08:55.280 --> 1:09:00.520]  the economy politics and more always interesting and informative when Max Kaiser joins us,
[1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:07.840]  but first here's Johnny Depp, a guy from Kentucky, trying to have a kind of quasi Atlantic accent,
[1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:14.840]  talking about getting Trump in the dark stomping on him with Doc Martins, I mean there's a
[1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:20.080]  longer clip we played at last hour and then saying has an actor killed a president, so
[1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:23.960]  it's all part of this pushing the narrative and get Democrats getting caught saying they
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:30.120]  hope Scalise dies and you've got when Trump says let's have prayers for him and his family
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:35.520]  and for the police officers and then the Democrats boo and hiss, I mean these are truly sickening
[1:09:35.520 --> 1:09:42.040]  people who are incredibly wimpy is the other part, most of them don't have jobs, most of
[1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:48.320]  them are mentally ill, I mean you go to a Democratic party event, it looks like day
[1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:53.720]  of the dead, especially the young people, it's very very sad, what has happened, we'll
[1:09:53.720 --> 1:10:00.240]  look at Johnny Depp, he looks like a cross between a meth head and a lot lizard, you
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:03.640]  know that you mix in with a child molester creeping around in a white van, I'm not saying
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:09.160]  he's a child molester but Johnny Depp looks like a child molester and he's all shaken
[1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:13.480]  from all the drugs he's taken and can hardly talk, what's going to happen if somebody walks
[1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:17.240]  up to him because they don't want him pushing civil war and pumps a bunch of bullets into
[1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:21.160]  him or God forbid don't blame the second amendment, they walk up and pull out a double
[1:10:21.160 --> 1:10:24.080]  itch dagger and just grab him by the back of the head and start running it into him,
[1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:29.320]  I hope that doesn't happen because they're all hoping for violence and stuff, I'm scared
[1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:34.280]  of violence, I don't have anything to do with it, now let's go ahead and, because we're
[1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:38.120]  winning the info war so good, why would we have that, don't worry they'll be time enough
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:42.900]  for whatever they want, I'm sure they're going to get what they want, here's Johnny Creeper
[1:10:42.900 --> 1:10:55.880]  Van Depp, I think he needs help, I don't know, a lot of wonderful dark places he could go,
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:11:05.000]  a lot of dark martins, it's just a question, I'm not insinuating anything, by the way
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:10.680]  this is going to be a repress, it will be harder, but I'd like that you're all a part
[1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:17.240]  of it, when was the last time an actor assassinated a president, how do you think this is so
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:32.960]  cool, just some drug addict, no I want to clarify I'm not an actor, I lied for a living,
[1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:43.080]  no what you are is a rotten toothed little snake, just look at him trying to act cool,
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:51.680]  don't try to dress like gypsies, get a job man, $600 million that you didn't give a charity
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:56.920]  that you blew and lost because you're such a moron and you've got all these fake supposed
[1:11:56.920 --> 1:12:05.240]  friends around you, imagine just waddling around acting cool like Johnny Depp does all
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:09.320]  day, when if he didn't have the money and he wasn't in movies people go oh look there's
[1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:15.360]  another junkie, there's another mess mouth, there's another rotten toothed know-it-all
[1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:21.760]  piece of crap that wants a war with hard working people because all the degenerate Hollywood
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:26.160]  folks hate Christians, that's why they hate Russia, why they hate America, they're a bunch
[1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:33.280]  of devil worshiping crap and America is scraping it off the bottom of our shoes and pretty
[1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:38.160]  soon Hollywood's going to be totally bankrupt, everybody should stop seeing their movies
[1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:44.240]  should stop watching what they do, should just only analyze their propaganda so folks
[1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:49.240]  know it's poison and just point out that's poison, that's death, that's destruction,
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:56.560]  now here is Michael Hastings wife, remember his car it blew up going on the road, Joe
[1:12:56.560 --> 1:13:01.640]  Biggs was at the funeral, she said I'm going to get these bastards, they killed him, but
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:05.680]  then when she went on Pierce Morgan she said oh nothing happened, it was totally normal
[1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:09.720]  and now she's saying the president's like a suicide bomber and he doesn't ever keep
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:14.680]  his word, no that's why they're mad is because he's really keeping his word on almost every
[1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:19.840]  agenda and then Congress is blocking him on tax cuts and things like that but the regulations
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:24.280]  are the equivalent of tax cuts, here it is, the broadcast I said bluff, I said the president
[1:13:24.280 --> 1:13:29.160]  was bluffing, I may have been perhaps too fair, it would seem as if the president may
[1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:34.200]  have been lying all along about the existence of these tapes, no he's just wasting, he wasted
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:39.280]  the country's collective time speculating over whether these tapes existed or not, it's
[1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:44.720]  a sad day when you cannot depend on the president's word and my advice would just be to Republicans
[1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:49.200]  who do cozy up to him, it's just like hugging a suicide bomber, he blows you up in the process
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:54.160]  with him, it's like hugging, that's a little strong at least, this is not, I mean look
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:59.040]  at what, if you go out on a limb, if you're a Republican who went out on a limb and defended
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:02.600]  Donald Trump over saying well he's got tapes that are going to back up his point of view,
[1:14:02.600 --> 1:14:08.720]  your car blows up, keep going, no exactly, she knows a lot about bombs, her husband got
[1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:16.640]  blown up and I'm sad that happened, but if you hug Trump he blows you up, he lies to
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:22.200]  you, now he said you better be careful there aren't tapes because he knew what he really
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:31.960]  said to Comey and he bluffed Comey into telling the truth that he didn't try to obstruct justice,
[1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:32.960]  so what did the MSM do?
[1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:36.880]  They just said it's not real, Comey never said that he didn't obstruct, Comey never
[1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:42.800]  said that really I have the clips, maybe we should play them again, that's how stupid
[1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:54.440]  they think we are, now continuing here, I want to deal with some other issues that are very
[1:14:54.440 --> 1:15:02.920]  important, we're going to do that at about 40 after when Max Kaiser leaves us, DWS says
[1:15:02.920 --> 1:15:09.300]  Jay Johnson is wrong in every respect, that's Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and that no one requested
[1:15:09.300 --> 1:15:13.600]  access to DNC servers, remember all that, but Jay Johnson who was the head of Homeland
[1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:21.440]  Security, he testified that they refused to let them look at the servers, but she says
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:25.440]  he's lying, so that's rats leaving the sinking ship, that's coming up, then I've got a George
[1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:28.840]  Carlin piece I'm going to play, and I've also got a Joe Rogan piece I'm going to play,
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:32.840]  this is very, very important, and I want to give Joe and the professor the other piece
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:40.840]  of the puzzle, because they're asking a question, but I'd like to give them the answer, so that's
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:47.040]  coming up, then Mike Cernovich is host of the 4th Hour, Michael Mallison expert on North
[1:15:47.040 --> 1:15:52.160]  Korea and that communist heaven will be joining us as well coming up the next hour, now Max
[1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:56.640]  Kaiser is in Mexico City, he does not need any introduction to our audience, he's been
[1:15:56.640 --> 1:16:01.280]  a busy man last year, haven't had him on much, Max Kaiser is a filmmaker, broadcaster and
[1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:07.360]  former major broker and options trader, he's also co-founder of Bitcoin Capital and presenter
[1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:13.840]  of the Kaiser Report on RT, MaxKaiser.com is his website, so he's always got a lot to
[1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:18.120]  talk about, I want to get into the economy, I want to get into the state of the world,
[1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:22.400]  the civil war, the media is trying to start, Max Kaiser, thank you for joining us.
[1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:27.440]  Yeah, sorry, I don't have the video set up, but...
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:30.000]  It's okay, I know you're having some internet problems, that's why you're on a bit late,
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  it's okay.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:37.440]  Yeah, Stacey has the phone that we were going to do the video on, and I don't know where
[1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:38.440]  she went.
[1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:40.960]  It's okay, we'll have you back on tomorrow or something, you know, whenever you want
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:48.640]  with Skype, because I loved you in Rome, I loved you in England, I loved you in Moscow,
[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:53.440]  I loved you in all of the places you've come on the show, it's always amazing tours you
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:58.120]  give us, so I was looking forward to you walking around in Mexico City, but that's okay.
[1:16:58.120 --> 1:17:00.240]  What do you want to hit first, Mr. Kaiser?
[1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:07.120]  Well, Alex, I think there's a very big story here in Mexico, Mexico City, you know, it's
[1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:12.120]  a country right on America's border, right on America's doorstep, and the comparison
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:18.320]  to the rhetoric that comes out of mainstream media in America that's always about bashing
[1:17:18.320 --> 1:17:23.240]  Russia and Putin bashing, and they say things like he kills journalists.
[1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:29.000]  Well, that's journalists who are getting killed all over the world, and probably Mexico is
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:34.120]  a place where you've got 90 to 100 journalists that have been murdered over the past 10 years.
[1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:37.200]  Just like the journalists murder capital of the world, and yet the mainstream media never
[1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:38.200]  talked about it.
[1:17:38.200 --> 1:17:43.760]  Here in Mexico City, there's a real revolutionary spirit to try to push back against an authoritarian
[1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:48.440]  government that has got 30 million Mexicans on the verge of starvation.
[1:17:48.440 --> 1:17:55.960]  So what we're doing here, Alex, is I'm spreading the word Bitcoin, and MaxCoin is the coin
[1:17:55.960 --> 1:18:01.760]  that was created kind of in my honor, it's getting new all-time highs on record volumes,
[1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:06.600]  how can mine the coin, talking to people all over the world that can mine crypto currencies
[1:18:06.600 --> 1:18:09.360]  on their desktop to give themselves economic freedom.
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:15.720]  Remember, Alex, a couple of years ago, we did draft JP Morgan by Silver, the Silver price
[1:18:15.720 --> 1:18:20.920]  got to 50, and then the banking cartel came in and smashed the price back down to $16,
[1:18:20.920 --> 1:18:21.920]  $17.
[1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:26.520]  But with crypto, there is no banking cartel to smash the price, it's just individuals
[1:18:26.520 --> 1:18:30.600]  around the world fighting back against the banking terrorism.
[1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:35.400]  I was about to say, from what I've seen in Brazil, in Mexico and other areas, I wouldn't
[1:18:35.400 --> 1:18:40.800]  call it right wing, it's like super libertarian, absolutely sick of communism, socialism, and
[1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:46.720]  fascism, but our media ignores that, and the Latin media is pretty establishment liberal
[1:18:46.720 --> 1:18:49.560]  like ours here, but is that not the case?
[1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:52.760]  What have you found in Latin America, because I know you've traveled extensively?
[1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:56.440]  Well, American media doesn't want to accept the truth.
[1:18:56.440 --> 1:19:02.800]  When we were in North Carolina before the election, the presidential election, we reported
[1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:06.960]  that we don't see any Hillary signs, all we see are Trump signs.
[1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:13.640]  We see great support for Trump, and we were accused of being pro-Russian because we were
[1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:19.120]  reporting the truth, and sure enough, Hillary lost North Carolina, Hillary lost Wisconsin.
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:22.600]  Just Americans are really being dumped down by the mainstream media.
[1:19:22.600 --> 1:19:26.440]  And again, in fairness, you're on RT, which is international, but you've said they've
[1:19:26.440 --> 1:19:28.120]  never controlled what you say, what you do.
[1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:32.000]  I mean, but you've been on Al Jazeera, you've been on BBC, you've been on a bunch of other
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  networks too.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  So, I mean, are you a British agent?
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:36.800]  Are you an Islamic agent?
[1:19:36.800 --> 1:19:41.080]  The only network that censored me aggressively was the BBC.
[1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:44.320]  The BBC is the worst of all international outlets.
[1:19:44.320 --> 1:19:50.720]  They control every single thing you say, they edit your show, and they cut things they don't
[1:19:50.720 --> 1:19:51.720]  like.
[1:19:51.720 --> 1:19:52.720]  That's the worst.
[1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:59.400]  All right, Max Kaiser, MaxKaiser.com is with us till 40 after, he's giving us vital intel.

[2:31:58.880 --> 2:32:09.880]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[2:32:09.880 --> 2:32:14.880]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[2:32:14.880 --> 2:32:22.880]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infomer.
[2:32:22.880 --> 2:32:34.880]  It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[2:32:34.880 --> 2:32:51.880]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[2:32:51.880 --> 2:32:58.880]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and infowarslife.com.
[2:33:22.880 --> 2:33:39.880]  The book is dear reader about the dear leader. I want to get him back for a full hour sometime to just go over the psychology of Kim Jong-un because he went to school in Switzerland and then he comes back and then his older brother runs off to go to Disney World and then they end up poisoning him.
[2:33:39.880 --> 2:33:52.880]  How do you live in Switzerland? Beautiful. Tons of food. People being nice to you and then go back and oppress your own people. So is he really in control? Is it China that's in control? Is it the military?
[2:33:52.880 --> 2:33:58.880]  You know, we hear a lot of stuff. The word is it's the military there. China's been trying to exert control. I'm not defending China.
[2:33:58.880 --> 2:34:09.880]  But we're going to get the expert. I mean, he's held one of the top experts, best-selling author, ghost writes a lot of the big, you know, top, you know, political books you see out there with Fox News hosts that have put out very prolific.
[2:34:09.880 --> 2:34:20.880]  Michael Malus, follow him on Twitter at Michael Malus. Going back to this just briefly, testosterone wars. I had a chance down to read this article fully because they gave it to me earlier. I only read part of it.
[2:34:20.880 --> 2:34:33.880]  They actually say we're bad selling vitamin B12 folks. Liquid methylcobalamin, the same type of people inject under the tongue. You get better absorption rate than just swallowing it or taking a pill.
[2:34:33.880 --> 2:34:46.880]  I mean, give me a break. Whole foods can sell it. Amazon can sell it. It works. My medical doctor, when I was 40, I went and got a checkup and they said you're pre pre diabetic and you better lose some weight and blah, blah, blah.
[2:34:46.880 --> 2:34:57.880]  By the way, vitamin B12 injections here take this and it really helped me. And then I went out one of the top companies and we put out secret 12. That is basically pharmaceutical grade. I mean, it's don't inject it.
[2:34:57.880 --> 2:35:07.880]  Coach, you have to do that from a doctor. It is vitamin B12. 80% other 20% this other vitamin B12 that helps it upload better. The point is, I mean, I get better energy off of it than a cup of coffee.
[2:35:07.880 --> 2:35:30.880]  And they're like, no one's really sure vitamin B12 is needed. You just die without it. And again, you have to understand, super male is a private label of the cold pressed into an oil form, male stamina energy, you name it, product.
[2:35:30.880 --> 2:35:44.880]  You understand that? Our colloidal silver is the one they sell in Whole Foods. We just sell at $5 lower. And then our toothpaste. But they're even demonizing that I sell toothpaste. What next is toothpaste not needed? Is that okay with you?
[2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:56.880]  You're such hypocrites. The mainstream media has Prozac ads and these ads where it says it can kill you and irritable this and the restless leg that and it'll cause heart attacks and brain damage and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2:35:56.880 --> 2:36:09.880]  Then they lie and say, oh, vaccines never hurt you. Then they've never had a side effect. Yeah, they just have a secret vaccine damage fund. They pay out billions a year on vaccine insert says he can kill you dead in a hammer.
[2:36:09.880 --> 2:36:21.880]  But they're okay pushing that. No, no, I'm bad. Well, guess what? Super male vitality is 30% off for the July special. Try it and just see what it does for you. There's a reason it's a best seller.
[2:36:21.880 --> 2:36:37.880]  Brain force plus is just a bunch of known new tropics. There's a reason it's a best seller. It's it is overall the best seller. We've got survival shield x2, deep earth iodine, just search engine iodine deficiency.
[2:36:37.880 --> 2:36:51.880]  IQ. That's all you need to know. And most of the out of the environment is bound to not be absorbed. Emirates essentials. Again, we got non nanosink. We copy the top brand in the country from the top brand that is kind enough to do that with us.
[2:36:51.880 --> 2:36:59.880]  So horrible. I'm selling sunscreen. There's no proof sunscreen is needed. Another conspiracy theory.
[2:36:59.880 --> 2:37:09.880]  Living defense. Check it out info wars life.com or triple a two five three three one three nine they're coming after us. We need your support. All right, back to our guest.
[2:37:09.880 --> 2:37:19.880]  I'm gonna try to shut up give him the floor. Give us the most important info about North Korea, where it's going. Kim Jong on what you think he's going to do who's really in control.
[2:37:19.880 --> 2:37:32.880]  Kim Jong is unquestionably in control. So the leadership and the regime are people who are there not because of their intelligence or their skill, but because of their loyalty. As we talked before the break, since everyone is always spying everyone else.
[2:37:32.880 --> 2:37:45.880]  This weeds out this loyal people. And at the very top, you just get these absolute bootlickers, which is good because you don't want smart people at the top. You want people who don't know what they're doing, because that would give you a great chance to neutralize the regime.
[2:37:45.880 --> 2:37:58.880]  And they are starting to freak out. So North Korea in many ways has a is a religious culture culture. They've made a religion of Juche of their leaders. They idolize them in regard to supernatural and they have their own version of the 10 commandments.
[2:37:58.880 --> 2:38:09.880]  And the 10th commandment says something like the leadership of the revolution shall be fulfilled through the generation until the end. What that means is only a descendant of the founder of North Korea.
[2:38:09.880 --> 2:38:21.880]  The great leader Kim Il-sung Kim Jong-un's grandfather can be a leader. So that's why Kim Jong-un killed his older brother Kim Jong-nam, because if you take out his older brother, he's safe. You don't have a plan B.
[2:38:21.880 --> 2:38:29.880]  So this was very much an insurance policy and a demonstration that he's starting to get scared of his hold on power.
[2:38:29.880 --> 2:38:31.880]  Keep going, brother.
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:46.880]  Well, I mean, and thankfully, I know neither of us are fans of China to put it mildly. The fact that the Chinese met with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the fact that the Chinese are publicly turning their back on North Korea and condemning them.
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:53.880]  This is very good news. Look, China has to defend a lot of their crap. They don't want an American ally on their border.
[2:38:53.880 --> 2:39:07.880]  They don't want 24 million North Korean refugees who don't speak Chinese crossing the two-man river and setting up camp in Manchuria. At the same time, China is trying to pass itself as respectable, as decent on the world stage.
[2:39:07.880 --> 2:39:18.880]  It's impossible to defend a college kid coming to your country. Welcomeed. He didn't sneak in. He was welcomed by the government as a tourist, and now he winds up dead.
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:26.880]  No one can defend this with a straight face, and this is why North Korea is starting to get very scared.
[2:39:26.880 --> 2:39:31.880]  They're now saying that Mr. Warnbeer was never tortured in custody.
[2:39:31.880 --> 2:39:40.880]  I think that's plausible, and here's why. I was in the same hotel as him. I stayed on the same floor. He was not a prisoner. He was a hostage.
[2:39:40.880 --> 2:39:48.880]  They've taken many Americans with some kind of pretense and held them as hostages, and everyone who got out says they were treated well by North Korean standards.
[2:39:48.880 --> 2:39:57.880]  Now, treating well by North Korean standards is still terribly. The doctors didn't find any signs of trauma in his body. If I had to guess, I would guess he was driven into cell harm.
[2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:04.880]  The point is, when you have a hostage, like any criminal, you want to make sure you can give that hostage back in exchange for your ransom.
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:13.880]  So the fact is, things obviously took a turn for the worse with him, and they're like, we got to get this body out of North Korea before we have a body in our hands, and that's exactly what happened.
[2:40:13.880 --> 2:40:24.880]  A week after he got back here, he was in a coffin, so that just tells you that they are not crazy. They are evil. They know what they're doing, and that makes them even more reprehensible.
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:38.880]  Again, I'm just sitting back as I start talking. I won't stop. This is all riveting, just to get into the psychology of this place. And the fact that they've got more land mass than the South, but the South is probably the most productive country in the world, has an incredibly high standard of living.
[2:40:38.880 --> 2:40:50.880]  And then just north, everything looks wasted. I'm told there are hardly any bugs or birds. They've eaten everything. Why doesn't communism produce this wondrous heaven? Look at Venezuela's collapsing into a road warrior right now.
[2:40:50.880 --> 2:41:00.880]  During the 90s, when things really went bad for them, they even had polio return. The average height of a North Korean is four inches shorter than the genetically identical South Koreans.
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:15.880]  South Korea has the highest per capita at one point of all of Eastern Asia. North Korea has African level GDP, so it takes a lot of work for this evil family to take this proud people and destroy the entire country.
[2:41:15.880 --> 2:41:19.880]  And this did not happen overnight, and it's not going to end overnight either.
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:28.880]  So this is like a vampire kingdom of a bunch of fat vampires running around torturing, raping and murdering. I mean, it's just incredible.
[2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:38.880]  And then when you see things like Al Jazeera running articles about how cute the traffic girls are in the capital city of Pyongyang, it's like, can you be any more delusional? Can you have any less...
[2:41:38.880 --> 2:41:45.880]  Why is there leftist defense of North Korea? I even see New York Times articles that kind of cutesy and say nice things about it.
[2:41:45.880 --> 2:42:00.880]  I can't even... Alex, God help me, I can't even begin to wrap my head around it. Again, being born in the Soviet Union, the idea that anyone can find anything kind of admirable about this country and what they're doing to the children, not having children have food.
[2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:06.880]  You can't even begin to wrap your head around that psychology. All you have to do is just get the behind me, Satan, is my approach to that.
[2:42:06.880 --> 2:42:10.880]  And let's talk about how he likes to kill even members of his own family.
[2:42:10.880 --> 2:42:29.880]  Right. So when Kim Jong-un took over for his father in 2011, Kim Jong-il's sister, Kim Hyun-wee, was behind the scenes guiding things. Kim Hyun-wee is so wicked, she drove her own daughter to suicide because her daughter married someone of a lower social class, right?
[2:42:29.880 --> 2:42:38.880]  So when he took over, that was her husband that was killed. He was not killed by dogs. That's a myth. But look at how the corporate media gets it wrong.
[2:42:38.880 --> 2:42:43.880]  You know, you heard all those stories that he got his uncle eaten by dogs and it's like, look how crazy North Korea is, look how crazy North Korea is.
[2:42:43.880 --> 2:42:51.880]  It's not that someone was eaten by dogs. It's that someone who was, like, third in line in the government was executed overnight without cause.
[2:42:51.880 --> 2:42:59.880]  Can you imagine if, you know, President Trump had the Secretary of State executed out of nowhere? It would be psychotic. It would not make any sense.
[2:42:59.880 --> 2:43:04.880]  Yet that is the norm in this most evil of countries.
[2:43:04.880 --> 2:43:09.880]  Well, if people want to go down this rabbit hole, they can just search in North Korean labor camps.
[2:43:09.880 --> 2:43:18.880]  But the sickest part is juxtaposing it. Kim Jong-un's women, and all these women dressed in white all around him, and they're all manicured and dressed in western style.
[2:43:18.880 --> 2:43:26.880]  They've all got western apparel. And then you see, you know, people being, babies being eaten by rats or them telling families in forced labor, go ahead and eat your child.
[2:43:26.880 --> 2:43:34.880]  And then they do eat your child. And then you look at the eyes of the guards. It's like they're demon possessed. It's like they're jack-o-lanterns.
[2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:38.880]  They are, it's like some evil spirit is feeding in North Korea.
[2:43:38.880 --> 2:43:48.880]  They are explicitly told the guards are, enemies of the leader are not human beings. And there's one story in these labor camps when a woman was raped by the guards.
[2:43:48.880 --> 2:43:59.880]  Well, you're not allowed to have sex with a guard. So she was punished. They ran her over with a truck, amputated her legs, and then she had to push herself around on a tire to still fulfill her work quota.
[2:43:59.880 --> 2:44:03.880]  That is how reprehensible it is in the camps. Also, they have family punishment.
[2:44:03.880 --> 2:44:09.880]  So when your family goes to the camps and let's suppose you kill yourself, your family has to fulfill your quota.
[2:44:09.880 --> 2:44:15.880]  So even death is not escaped from the leadership of this horrific regime.
[2:44:15.880 --> 2:44:23.880]  And for those that don't know, they have restaurants in Denver and New York and London celebrating North Korea, celebrating China.
[2:44:23.880 --> 2:44:32.880]  And it's a form of sick cuckolding. It's like people in the lap of luxury, the lap of freedom are almost like begging to open the gate of hell.
[2:44:32.880 --> 2:44:40.880]  Yeah. I mean, when you go there and you see these people, and what I did being an obnoxious New Yorker, I would wave at everyone, get right in their face.
[2:44:40.880 --> 2:44:45.880]  Because when you do that to someone, the reaction is going to be sincere. They're going to be taken aback.
[2:44:45.880 --> 2:44:50.880]  And you'd see grandmas with their grandkids doting over them. Teenage girls would giggle and cover their mouths.
[2:44:50.880 --> 2:44:55.880]  You know, the teenage guys who thought they were too tough for school with their track suits would just stare at you and blame you're down.
[2:44:55.880 --> 2:45:01.880]  But their reactions were so normal. And you realize communism can't turn people into robots. If they could, it would work.
[2:45:01.880 --> 2:45:09.880]  But so what you have is 24 million prisoners who are desperately trying to live normal lives in the most abnormal country on Earth.
[2:45:09.880 --> 2:45:14.880]  And that's why I'm so honored that I get to talk about this to give people understanding and why I wrote my book.
[2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:18.880]  So people can get this is not something to take lightly.
[2:45:18.880 --> 2:45:24.880]  This is what happens once you go into collectivism. Just evil rises. It's not about ingenuity. It's not about work.
[2:45:24.880 --> 2:45:30.880]  It's all just about barbarism. Michael Malish, you know, you've written a lot of bestselling books. They know how to Google your name.
[2:45:30.880 --> 2:45:34.880]  I mean, you can see satellite photos only what two towns have have power.
[2:45:34.880 --> 2:45:39.880]  And then you see the south. It's all lit up like a Christmas tree just to show the deindustrialization.
[2:45:39.880 --> 2:45:47.880]  But you've got gigantic wave o's to go into a place where they routinely, as you know, kidnap and kill people.
[2:45:47.880 --> 2:45:49.880]  Why did you do this?
[2:45:49.880 --> 2:45:59.880]  Because I had to because someone had to do something about this because it was as a Jew, as a Russian, those are two chances for my family to have been taken to a camp in the middle of the night.
[2:45:59.880 --> 2:46:08.880]  And the biggest place where that's still the case on Earth is North Korea. And I said, by golly, I'm going to do something about this because after a while as a writer, you want to get back and kind of make a difference.
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:15.880]  And if I'm moving the needle a little bit over there, that is a huge opportunity for positive change on this earth.
[2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:23.880]  I'm just so ashamed of humanity. I feel guilty for North Korea. I think that's what you just said. We're not like liberals here like trying to find guilt.
[2:46:23.880 --> 2:46:29.880]  I just can't help but feel guilty when I've got this great life in this great country to see people living like this.
[2:46:29.880 --> 2:46:33.880]  And then I see people making jokes about it. I want to smack them in the face.
[2:46:33.880 --> 2:46:38.880]  Right. And what you also see a lot of times is these kind of some of these neocons who don't understand.
[2:46:38.880 --> 2:46:41.880]  They'd be like, they're threatening us. We should just bomb them to oblivion.
[2:46:41.880 --> 2:46:46.880]  I'm like, yeah, real tough guy. You're bombing 24 million slaves. That's the real moral.
[2:46:46.880 --> 2:46:54.880]  No TV. They believe the propaganda the children are taking at birth in the lower cast. They don't know where they are and they believe since the last war when over a million of died in the north alone.
[2:46:54.880 --> 2:47:02.880]  They're waiting for this and they've got what is it 100,000 pieces of artillery aimed at the old. I mean, let's talk about war scenarios here.
[2:47:02.880 --> 2:47:11.880]  I mean, Alex, it's a nightmare scenario. You know, you hear in the press is like, what if they're going to nuke LA right now, even if they didn't have nukes, which they certainly do.
[2:47:11.880 --> 2:47:17.880]  Right now, they can send so many missiles into Seoul, South Korea, population 10 million just south of North Korea.
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:22.880]  Can you I don't even want to imagine that visual of missiles hitting all these skyscrapers.
[2:47:22.880 --> 2:47:33.880]  It would be like the film Independence Day, but for real, the horrors of that are unfathomable and they boast explicitly that if we're going down, we're taking down as many people with us as we can.
[2:47:33.880 --> 2:47:40.880]  So people who are just like, why don't they get with Kim Jong-un and say, let's work with the West. Let's make a deal, bring wealth in.
[2:47:40.880 --> 2:47:45.880]  I just, I guess they just love the power and they're too cowardly. They're just, they're such big demons.
[2:47:45.880 --> 2:47:49.880]  Look at these fat little demons. I just, you know, there's two reasons.
[2:47:49.880 --> 2:47:56.880]  Kim Jong-nam, the eldest brother wanted to liberalize and Kim Jong-il said, if you want openness, open a window, we're Korea.
[2:47:56.880 --> 2:47:58.880]  What worked for China will work for us.
[2:47:58.880 --> 2:48:01.880]  So that's what won the reasons why he was passed over for Kim Jong-un.
[2:48:01.880 --> 2:48:09.880]  But also, if you look at Romania, Iraq, Libya and many other such dictatorships, when these regimes go down, the people at the top are personally.
[2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:12.880]  Tortured and murdered with good reason.
[2:48:12.880 --> 2:48:14.880]  That's right. Like Shilchescu.
[2:48:14.880 --> 2:48:20.880]  Yes. So if Kim Jong-un lost his control on power, certainly someone would and should put a bullet in him.
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:25.880]  So that's a big reason for him to do whatever he can to maintain that hold.
[2:48:25.880 --> 2:48:29.880]  Yeah. We should do a whole show sometime on the fall of Shilchescu.
[2:48:29.880 --> 2:48:33.880]  They had power for the whole country, but he only liked his little city and a city having it.
[2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:38.880]  So he turned everybody's power off at nighttime. I mean, he just, these people.
[2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:41.880]  And one of the greatest moments that you will ever see as someone who loves freedom.
[2:48:41.880 --> 2:48:47.880]  If you go on YouTube and look up Shilchescu's final speech, he would give speeches everyone had to cheer or else, you know, they're going to get you.
[2:48:47.880 --> 2:48:51.880]  And this is the first time the audience in 40 years or something like that started booing him.
[2:48:51.880 --> 2:48:55.880]  And you see the look on his face when he turns and he realizes the jig is up.
[2:48:55.880 --> 2:48:58.880]  And I think within a week later, him and his evil wife were shot.
[2:48:58.880 --> 2:49:02.880]  That's because his own military was ready to kill him.
[2:49:02.880 --> 2:49:04.880]  Yeah. But Kim Jong-un, it's not the same way.
[2:49:04.880 --> 2:49:08.880]  They are loyal to the leader and that makes it even harder to imagine an end game there.
[2:49:08.880 --> 2:49:12.880]  Well, I know this. I'm not looking for a war, but the left openly wants a civil war.
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:19.880]  I think we've already entered the first levels of it from Johnny Depp to Madonna saying kill the president to Kathy Griffin.
[2:49:19.880 --> 2:49:28.880]  And I just, they're the most unmilitaristic wimps trying to start a war with the ghost of George Washington.
[2:49:28.880 --> 2:49:31.880]  I feel sorry for them. They actually kicked this thing off.
[2:49:31.880 --> 2:49:35.880]  Oh, yeah. I mean, the other side has all the guns.
[2:49:35.880 --> 2:49:40.880]  You know, don't bring a decapitated head to a gunfight. You're not going to win, Kathy Griffin.
[2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:43.880]  So is it a coming of age for the left?
[2:49:43.880 --> 2:49:46.880]  They're all say they're anti-violence, but they want it offensively.
[2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:48.880]  I mean, they're so pathetic and childlike.
[2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:52.880]  Why do you think you're just running around talking about murder and frothing at the mouth?
[2:49:52.880 --> 2:49:55.880]  Because I think when you start talking to each other and have an echo chamber,
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:49:58.880]  you have to try to do each other, you know, how they can stand up or improv.
[2:49:58.880 --> 2:50:02.880]  The first rule is yes, and you have to build on the other person's joke, right?
[2:50:02.880 --> 2:50:07.880]  So they're trying to outdo each other in virtue signal to show their consent for the president to be like,
[2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:10.880]  well, I want him to be impeached. Oh, yeah, well, I want him to be shot.
[2:50:10.880 --> 2:50:16.880]  And they don't realize how this comes off to even regular liberal people who might believe in a social statement.
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:18.880]  Yeah, I want his supporters killed.
[2:50:18.880 --> 2:50:25.880]  Yeah, yeah, right. And that's why the moderates are going to Trump because it's like, listen, I disagree with the guy.
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:29.880]  I don't want you making fun of his son. I don't want you, you know, ask.
[2:50:29.880 --> 2:50:31.880]  It only makes you love Trump more.
[2:50:31.880 --> 2:50:35.880]  Michael Malus of the book, Dear Reader, available in bookstores everywhere.
[2:50:35.880 --> 2:50:37.880]  Michael Malus, please don't get it on Amazon. He's a globalist.
[2:50:37.880 --> 2:50:40.880]  Get it somewhere else and support independent press in this country.
[2:50:40.880 --> 2:50:43.880]  Michael Malus, you're amazing. Thank you so much for joining us.
[2:50:43.880 --> 2:50:44.880]  Thank you, Alex. Great pleasure.
[2:50:44.880 --> 2:50:45.880]  Wow, powerful.
[2:50:45.880 --> 2:50:50.880]  OK, I got Joe Bix popping in because he knew Michael Hastings' wife.
[2:50:50.880 --> 2:50:52.880]  Remember, he's a Rolling Stones guy. His car blew up.
[2:50:52.880 --> 2:50:56.880]  She's the one going around saying Trump's a suicide bomber. Let's talk about her.
[2:51:22.880 --> 2:51:33.880]  Are you one of the 15 million men in the U.S. who suffer from an enlarged prostate, also known as BPH?
[2:51:33.880 --> 2:51:38.880]  If your life revolves around finding the closest bathroom, if you're tired of waking up many times at night to urinate,
[2:51:38.880 --> 2:51:40.880]  then you need to know about prostate miracle.

[2:54:53.880 --> 2:54:58.880]  When it comes out, Obama's going down. He's been a liberal. His car blows up going down the road.
[2:54:58.880 --> 2:55:03.880]  The engine shoots out like a hundred and something yards. His wife tells big. She thought it was dirty pool.
[2:55:03.880 --> 2:55:10.880]  His funeral. And she goes on seeing in and says, oh, everything's wonderful. Oh, no, the car was driving fast.
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:16.880]  He was running for his life when that happened. So let's play that clip and get Joe Big's take on it. Here she is.
[2:55:16.880 --> 2:55:21.880]  We're going to play the clip of her just coming out about Trump. Here it is.
[2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:26.880]  I said bluff. I said the president was bluffing. I may have been perhaps too fair.
[2:55:26.880 --> 2:55:31.880]  It would seem as if the president may have been lying all along about the existence of these tapes.
[2:55:31.880 --> 2:55:37.880]  No, he's just wasting. He wasted the country's collective time speculating over whether these tapes existed or not.
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:41.880]  It's a sad day when you cannot depend on the president's word.
[2:55:41.880 --> 2:55:46.880]  And my advice would just be to Republicans who do cozy up to him. It's just like hugging a suicide bomber.
[2:55:46.880 --> 2:55:49.880]  He blows you up in the process with him.
[2:55:49.880 --> 2:55:54.880]  That's a little strongly. Yeah, I mean, this is not. I mean, look at what if you go out on a limb,
[2:55:54.880 --> 2:56:00.880]  if you're a Republican who went out on a limb and defended Donald Trump over saying, well, he's got tapes that are going to back up this point of view.
[2:56:00.880 --> 2:56:04.880]  You just got going. That's not what Trump said. He said, you better watch out.
[2:56:04.880 --> 2:56:13.880]  I might have tapes bluffing. Comey into not lying and saying that the president tried to obstruct justice, which coming says he didn't.
[2:56:13.880 --> 2:56:21.880]  So and here's the deal when Trump says there might be tapes. Somebody might have tapes, but I didn't tape it.
[2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:25.880]  Trump has tapes. You're in the president's office. You better believe it was taped just not by him.
[2:56:25.880 --> 2:56:32.880]  He's let everybody know. OK, he tapes everything, everything, everything.
[2:56:32.880 --> 2:56:37.880]  I've never taped anybody, but I mean, Megan Kelly was coming on so hard on the phone.
[2:56:37.880 --> 2:56:39.880]  I was like, this is the biggest hit piece on earth.
[2:56:39.880 --> 2:56:44.880]  And I said, hold on one moment. I got the other phone. I didn't even have a record app on my phone to record phone calls.
[2:56:44.880 --> 2:56:47.880]  I guess they have those. I had to get another phone recorded that way.
[2:56:47.880 --> 2:56:52.880]  Oh, you're being so immoral taping her. She was coming on, man. You can hear it.
[2:56:52.880 --> 2:57:00.880]  And when she said the tape, how she's obsessed with me and wants to have dinner with me like I'm some idiot that would like even think she's attractive.
[2:57:00.880 --> 2:57:09.880]  Joe Biggs, you know the wife, the widow. And of course, she was on the National Security Council herself as a top aide.
[2:57:09.880 --> 2:57:13.880]  Very, very interesting to have her up there saying this. What do you make of it, Joe?
[2:57:13.880 --> 2:57:17.880]  I mean, it's disgusting. It's the same kind of rhetoric we see from the left day in and day out.
[2:57:17.880 --> 2:57:20.880]  I mean, you have Johnny Depp coming out calling for an assassination of Trump.
[2:57:20.880 --> 2:57:27.880]  You've got Kathy Griffin. It just fits this entire narrative. And she's someone who used to work for Bush.
[2:57:27.880 --> 2:57:35.880]  You know, I was shocked more than anything. My buddy Josh Kaplan posted the video yesterday and I just saw her and I was immediately, I'm not going to lie, I was pretty triggered.
[2:57:35.880 --> 2:57:42.880]  Because I just don't, ever since what happened with the funeral and how she turned her back on that, I've kind of been upset with her from the get go.
[2:57:42.880 --> 2:57:46.880]  I just stopped talking to her. When I saw her face, I was like, God, I got to watch this. What's going to happen?
[2:57:46.880 --> 2:57:51.880]  And when she goes, Trump is like a suicide bomber. I'm like, are you kidding me?
[2:57:51.880 --> 2:58:02.880]  Like this is the kind of rhetoric that leads to people being shot at. This is the type of stuff that fuels those basement dwellers who live at home with their mom and then finally come out of the shadows
[2:58:02.880 --> 2:58:07.880]  and try to pop off a few rounds at Republicans and have kill lists. That's adding to the fire. It's ridiculous.
[2:58:07.880 --> 2:58:14.880]  And they're right around saying hunt Republicans and then they don't even apologize for it. What do you think their plan is, Joe?
[2:58:14.880 --> 2:58:22.880]  They want us to pop first. They want, they want to provoke us to a point to where we pop off and we're the ones who draw first blood and that's what they're trying to do.
[2:58:22.880 --> 2:58:25.880]  But they keep drawing blood. They've attacked us time and time again.
[2:58:25.880 --> 2:58:26.880]  I agree with that.
[2:58:26.880 --> 2:58:28.880]  The thing is, though, is the left media never covers that.
[2:58:28.880 --> 2:58:32.880]  Back in the 70s, we'll finish up. Then Mike Services is coming up. I want to ask Joe Biggs.
[2:58:32.880 --> 2:58:38.880]  Clearly, they're behind the violence they wanted. Are they getting ready to stage a false flag? That'd be the perfect move right now.
[2:58:38.880 --> 2:58:45.880]  Infowars.com. Spread that link. They hate us. They're trying to shut us down. Support us. Free shipping. Infowars.com.
[2:58:45.880 --> 2:59:08.880]  Revolutionary act to support us.
[2:59:15.880 --> 2:59:25.880]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family. Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[2:59:25.880 --> 2:59:33.880]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[2:59:33.880 --> 2:59:39.880]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[2:59:39.880 --> 2:59:48.880]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfowarsLife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[3:00:09.880 --> 3:00:23.880]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:23.880 --> 3:00:28.880]  Alright, I appreciate Joe Biggs popping in to talk about this lady popping off of the president being a suicide bomber.
[3:00:28.880 --> 3:00:33.880]  When just a month ago on the same network, there are any terrorism experts said ISIS should hit Trump targets.
[3:00:33.880 --> 3:00:40.880]  It's like you're actually on the news asking ISIS to coordinate attacks. I mean, and what's going to happen if somebody kills Trump?
[3:00:40.880 --> 3:00:46.880]  What's going to happen if somebody, or Johnny Depp, or CNN hosts saying, well, it's just political.
[3:00:46.880 --> 3:00:51.880]  He's not evil shooting Congressman Scalise in the cops. What happens when somebody shoots them?
[3:00:51.880 --> 3:00:56.880]  Are they going to then say, oh, it's just political? Again, they want to play the victim, but they're the ones on the attack.
[3:00:56.880 --> 3:00:58.880]  Why haven't they staged big false flags?
[3:00:58.880 --> 3:01:06.880]  I mean, what happens when a guy gets stabbed nine times coming out of a political rally in support of Donald Trump?
[3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:10.880]  You know, that's ridiculous. These guys are willing to take that extra step.
[3:01:10.880 --> 3:01:15.880]  They're willing to put blade in the flesh. They're willing to put bullets through flesh, and it's ridiculous.
[3:01:15.880 --> 3:01:22.880]  And he gets called a white nationalist. He gets called a racist because he's a white guy.
[3:01:22.880 --> 3:01:28.880]  Oh, yeah. The media says, punch a Nazi, stab a Nazi. So he's a white guy. He's a white nationalist.
[3:01:28.880 --> 3:01:31.880]  Now, major feminists are saying, abort your baby if it's white.
[3:01:31.880 --> 3:01:37.880]  Yeah, it's ridiculous. I mean, white genocide is real, and it's being directed by liberal white people.
[3:01:37.880 --> 3:01:42.880]  I'm not giving the minorities a pass here, but I should be like, OK, white genocide, yeah, right.
[3:01:42.880 --> 3:01:47.880]  It's all over the news saying white should all be killed. What in the hell is going on?
[3:01:47.880 --> 3:01:54.880]  You have to look at people like Tariq Nashid. This guy is on Twitter every day just spewing out hateful messages.
[3:01:54.880 --> 3:01:59.880]  Anytime there's a white person involved with anything, he's automatically a Nazi. He's automatically this and that.
[3:01:59.880 --> 3:02:06.880]  And this guy has a huge following. He says that everyone that was involved with the anti-Sharia march were all closet racists.
[3:02:06.880 --> 3:02:08.880]  They were closet Islamophobes, and that's what they were.
[3:02:08.880 --> 3:02:15.880]  I'm not a closet Islamophob. I'm very phobic of Islam. I don't get anywhere near Saudi Arabia or these places where women walk around in hoods.
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:20.880]  I have a panic attack walking around the street with a bunch of women with hoods over their heads and guys walking around wearing diapers and everything.
[3:02:20.880 --> 3:02:21.880]  I don't like it.
[3:02:21.880 --> 3:02:25.880]  Yeah, I don't like a teletubbie. I don't want to look at a clothes up umbrella walking through the streets.
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:31.880]  This stuff is crazy. And we're racist because we don't want what we're seeing happening in Europe coming over here.
[3:02:31.880 --> 3:02:37.880]  And it's already starting to happen here. I mean, we've already had the Orlando shooting. We've already had San Bernardino.
[3:02:37.880 --> 3:02:41.880]  We've already had Chattanooga. I mean, nine, I mean, time and time again, we've had so many things.
[3:02:41.880 --> 3:02:45.880]  And yet they just go, oh, well, it's okay, though. It's not all Muslims.
[3:02:45.880 --> 3:02:54.880]  Yeah, it's not all Muslims, but it's a 1.7 billion population and only takes a small percentage of those guys to be bad and inflict harm on 10 times more than that.
[3:02:54.880 --> 3:02:55.880]  And it's already happening.
[3:02:55.880 --> 3:03:01.880]  Listen, if you want to get into Switzerland or Japan, you got to have a degree and some money and they don't care if you're black.
[3:03:01.880 --> 3:03:05.880]  You don't care if you're Asian. They don't care. You better have your stuff squared away.
[3:03:05.880 --> 3:03:13.880]  Nobody brings in people from failed Muslim states like Somalia and Sudan and Syria with its nutball.
[3:03:13.880 --> 3:03:21.880]  And I'm sure you've now seen where now the German Green Party wants to bring in whole villages and transplant them into German villages.
[3:03:21.880 --> 3:03:26.880]  Yeah, there's 600,000 population of Shia Muslims in Germany alone.
[3:03:26.880 --> 3:03:36.880]  Those are the same kind of people that that do the top beer where they every year they take blades and swords and smash them into their foreheads until they split their own heads open.
[3:03:36.880 --> 3:03:40.880]  They're going to split their own heads open. What makes you think you're not going to lob your head off?
[3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:49.880]  All I know is it's just, it's, it's, it's, it's total insane asylum behavior.
[3:03:49.880 --> 3:03:56.880]  And I just can't believe the left has gone so mentally ill. Where do you think this ends, Joe Biggs?
[3:03:56.880 --> 3:04:02.880]  It definitely ends with someone trying to take an attempt on, on President Trump's life.
[3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:05.880]  It ends with someone doing something like that, trying to...
[3:04:05.880 --> 3:04:08.880]  Well, we've already seen the guy trying to grab the gun from the cop and do that in other events.
[3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:12.880]  Sure, but I mean, I think it ends with them attacking Trump supporters.
[3:04:12.880 --> 3:04:17.880]  This is really an attempt at bullying. Just like Hitler bombing civilian centers in World War II in England, it had the opposite effect.
[3:04:17.880 --> 3:04:21.880]  He thought it would make the Brits give up. They actually got solidified because of that.
[3:04:21.880 --> 3:04:27.880]  There's actually a group of Antifa I found out yesterday that meet every Thursday at a public library in Austin, Texas,
[3:04:27.880 --> 3:04:33.880]  under the guise of a, a history class where they, they go in and they, they do homework or whatever.
[3:04:33.880 --> 3:04:39.880]  And Antifa is allowed to openly discuss what they're doing, their communism and their tactics to attack people,
[3:04:39.880 --> 3:04:43.880]  especially for the July 1st, March, it's going to be next Saturday at the Capitol.
[3:04:43.880 --> 3:04:48.880]  They're allowed to openly discuss that stuff in a public library without anything.
[3:04:48.880 --> 3:04:54.880]  It's ridiculous. But we go meet somewhere and we talk about how we're, we're Trump supporters, like the Portland State students,
[3:04:54.880 --> 3:04:56.880]  and they get shut down. They're harassed.
[3:04:56.880 --> 3:04:58.880]  That's right. Joe Biggs, thank you.
[3:04:58.880 --> 3:05:02.880]  Wow. You're going to love the latest idea out of the EU.
[3:05:02.880 --> 3:05:06.880]  Scott Keller, a German member of the European Parliament and of the Green Party,
[3:05:06.880 --> 3:05:10.880]  said we should transplant entire villages from Syria to Germany,
[3:05:10.880 --> 3:05:13.880]  and that would encourage more migrants to enter Germany.
[3:05:13.880 --> 3:05:14.880]  Listen to these quotes.
[3:05:14.880 --> 3:05:19.880]  The idea of Syrian villages is only one possibility we can use, for example,
[3:05:19.880 --> 3:05:22.880]  if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees.
[3:05:22.880 --> 3:05:28.880]  People would rather go where compatriots already live, which makes integration and acceptance easier.
[3:05:28.880 --> 3:05:31.880]  Let's look at these three compatriots from Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:05:31.880 --> 3:05:34.880]  Sweden, migrants viciously beat disabled man while calling him racist.
[3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:41.880]  Three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a homeless man's wallet in a train station during an incident which took place last month.
[3:05:41.880 --> 3:05:44.880]  The handicapped man was kicked and punched and received a vicious uppercut,
[3:05:44.880 --> 3:05:48.880]  as one of the migrants lectured him about war on Muslims and how all Swedes were racist.
[3:05:48.880 --> 3:05:50.880]  Now how's that for acceptance?
[3:05:50.880 --> 3:05:53.880]  You can read both articles now on Infowars.com.
[3:05:53.880 --> 3:05:57.880]  Roger reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[3:05:57.880 --> 3:06:04.880]  Let's go to Devin and Florida. Devin and Florida, you're on the air.

[3:06:23.880 --> 3:06:25.880]  Which dude for surgical does you like best?
[3:06:25.880 --> 3:06:29.880]  I really like the vitamin interfusion to be honest. That's really incredible.
[3:06:29.880 --> 3:06:30.880]  It's amazing.
[3:06:30.880 --> 3:06:34.880]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt the week.
[3:06:34.880 --> 3:06:39.880]  My morning was fantastic and I love these guys, I love the info, it's true.
[3:06:39.880 --> 3:06:45.880]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence,

[3:08:23.880 --> 3:08:25.880]  Hollywood.
[3:08:28.880 --> 3:08:30.880]  Babylon.
[3:08:30.880 --> 3:08:32.880]  Hollywood.
[3:08:32.880 --> 3:08:34.880]  Babylon.
[3:08:36.880 --> 3:08:38.880]  Hollywood.
[3:08:40.880 --> 3:08:43.880]  I'm going to let certain of us take over. He's in D.C. soon.
[3:08:43.880 --> 3:08:48.880]  You'll have some big scoops where he already has them, but he's got to let those develop a little bit.
[3:08:48.880 --> 3:08:52.880]  Things too fresh, you know, exposure sources.
[3:08:52.880 --> 3:08:56.880]  But look at this headline out of the Newark Daily News.
[3:08:56.880 --> 3:08:58.880]  June 20th.
[3:08:58.880 --> 3:09:00.880]  Just came out a few days ago, I just saw it.
[3:09:00.880 --> 3:09:03.880]  Celebrities, Alex Jones, and sexual abuse.
[3:09:03.880 --> 3:09:06.880]  Read the article, there's nothing about me in sexual abuse. They just say that.
[3:09:06.880 --> 3:09:08.880]  That's called fake news.
[3:09:08.880 --> 3:09:11.880]  Here's another one, testosterone wars.
[3:09:11.880 --> 3:09:17.880]  We have like 39 products, most up in private label, best sellers of companies that supply whole foods.
[3:09:17.880 --> 3:09:23.880]  That's okay. The Jeff Bezos gave $600 million to the Washington Post via the CIA to try to overthrow Trump.
[3:09:23.880 --> 3:09:30.880]  But I sell super-mobile vitality, which they admit is a bunch of known herbs, concentrated, and I'm evil.
[3:09:30.880 --> 3:09:34.880]  I need to be shut down and I'm bad.
[3:09:34.880 --> 3:09:37.880]  But they reached out to us, but we didn't respond.
[3:09:37.880 --> 3:09:39.880]  A bunch of bulls.
[3:09:39.880 --> 3:09:43.880]  Always the same, but people don't buy into that anymore.
[3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:47.880]  And a lot of the left says, we're not calling for Trump's death as they call for it constantly.
[3:09:47.880 --> 3:09:49.880]  And then meth.
[3:09:49.880 --> 3:09:53.880]  You know, he's a drug addict, meth-head, looks like a meth-head, child molester.
[3:09:53.880 --> 3:09:56.880]  Johnny Depp, creeping around, shaking, hardly talk.
[3:09:56.880 --> 3:09:59.880]  I'm not saying he's a child molester.
[3:09:59.880 --> 3:10:04.880]  You know, somebody needs to get Trump in a dark room and stomp on his head.
[3:10:04.880 --> 3:10:07.880]  You know, it's an actor kill a president.
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:09.880]  Everybody's like, ooh, you're so cool.
[3:10:09.880 --> 3:10:12.880]  Everyone's so sick of Hollywood, we're so sick of all you people.
[3:10:12.880 --> 3:10:16.880]  This guy made $600 million and he's such a crackhead.
[3:10:16.880 --> 3:10:18.880]  He's bankrupt.
[3:10:18.880 --> 3:10:22.880]  And then stumbling around with some other lunatic on the stage.
[3:10:22.880 --> 3:10:27.880]  And then you look at the crowd, like a bunch of lobotomized walruses.
[3:10:27.880 --> 3:10:29.880]  It's sick.
[3:10:29.880 --> 3:10:33.880]  Then you got Mika Brzezinski, whose dad advocated dictatorship and killing populations,
[3:10:33.880 --> 3:10:36.880]  developing dictatorship under President Trump.
[3:10:36.880 --> 3:10:40.880]  MSNBC host compares Trump to suicide bomber.
[3:10:40.880 --> 3:10:43.880]  Another host says that ISIS should bomb Trump.
[3:10:43.880 --> 3:10:48.880]  I mean, this is just a bunch of people that have lived in this bubble of liberty
[3:10:48.880 --> 3:10:54.880]  and have been a little aggressive wimps, but never been in a real fight their whole life,
[3:10:54.880 --> 3:10:57.880]  running around trying to start a war with an armed camp.
[3:10:57.880 --> 3:11:00.880]  But like adults, we're sitting back letting you kill a few of us, do this and that,
[3:11:00.880 --> 3:11:03.880]  shoot some Congressmen, some cops, trying to get you to stop just saying,
[3:11:03.880 --> 3:11:05.880]  please stop, please stop.
[3:11:05.880 --> 3:11:07.880]  Okay, start getting ready for him, get set up, get ready.
[3:11:07.880 --> 3:11:11.880]  Okay, we're trying to fix things peacefully. Here's some prosperity.
[3:11:11.880 --> 3:11:13.880]  Oh, you're not going to stop, are you?
[3:11:13.880 --> 3:11:17.880]  Well, you're going to be dealt with once the hammer comes down.
[3:11:17.880 --> 3:11:19.880]  Legally and lawfully.
[3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:22.880]  Johnny Depp, all the rest of you, you're going to get what you want.
[3:11:22.880 --> 3:11:23.880]  It's going to happen.
[3:11:23.880 --> 3:11:27.880]  Look at this headline, hero of the London terror attack, homeless,
[3:11:27.880 --> 3:11:32.880]  the lion of London Bridge, you know, who fought off the guys.
[3:11:32.880 --> 3:11:35.880]  We couldn't kill another six, seven people, fought three guys with knives,
[3:11:35.880 --> 3:11:37.880]  beat their ass, cop showed up and shot them.
[3:11:37.880 --> 3:11:40.880]  He's homeless from his medical bills,
[3:11:40.880 --> 3:11:44.880]  but the Islamists are getting all these free houses.
[3:11:44.880 --> 3:11:46.880]  That's how it works, folks.
[3:11:46.880 --> 3:11:50.880]  It's sick. America and Europe's openness has been used to destroy us.
[3:11:50.880 --> 3:11:53.880]  The good news is humanity is striking back.
[3:11:53.880 --> 3:11:58.880]  Mike Cernovich, medium.com at Cernovich, joining us.
[3:11:58.880 --> 3:12:00.880]  So much has happened.
[3:12:00.880 --> 3:12:02.880]  Well, no one even cares about Megan Kelly now.
[3:12:02.880 --> 3:12:04.880]  They admit lowest ratings ever.
[3:12:04.880 --> 3:12:06.880]  I can't believe it.
[3:12:06.880 --> 3:12:10.880]  Even though they edited me like hell, you could have had a ham sandwich up against her.
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:13.880]  They have declared me the victor so that I don't get to credit our listeners.
[3:12:13.880 --> 3:12:18.880]  Everybody get the credit, but we are going to be releasing next week, the audio.
[3:12:18.880 --> 3:12:21.880]  I just, and when I say edited, we'll release raw clips.
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:24.880]  We'll say, here's what I said raw with the transcript.
[3:12:24.880 --> 3:12:27.880]  Then we'll say, here I have said it at this minute and 10 minutes later,
[3:12:27.880 --> 3:12:30.880]  11 minutes later said this totally different subjects edited together.
[3:12:30.880 --> 3:12:32.880]  She did it.
[3:12:32.880 --> 3:12:37.880]  Despite the fact I wonder about Katie Couric, who got caught doing that and got sued over it.
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:39.880]  She still did it, Mike Cernovich.
[3:12:39.880 --> 3:12:41.880]  Their editor still did it.
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:43.880]  And Sean Hannity came out and said, release the full tape.
[3:12:43.880 --> 3:12:45.880]  He knows what Ted Koppel did to him.
[3:12:45.880 --> 3:12:50.880]  Seventy seconds after a 50 minute interview, they entered me off and on for 12 hours,
[3:12:50.880 --> 3:12:53.880]  four hours straight, five hours probably.
[3:12:53.880 --> 3:12:57.880]  So it just shows how we, Cernovich, we have them.
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:12:59.880]  We have them editing stuff together.
[3:12:59.880 --> 3:13:00.880]  We have them.
[3:13:00.880 --> 3:13:03.880]  And they're all just, they're all just, they're all just arrogant.
[3:13:03.880 --> 3:13:08.880]  Well, CNN, according to the latest ad week, only did 750,000 total viewers.
[3:13:08.880 --> 3:13:09.880]  They're all on the decline.
[3:13:09.880 --> 3:13:10.880]  That's the whole point.
[3:13:10.880 --> 3:13:11.880]  They really are.
[3:13:11.880 --> 3:13:12.880]  They really are.
[3:13:12.880 --> 3:13:13.880]  No buddies.
[3:13:13.880 --> 3:13:14.880]  They're on the decline.
[3:13:14.880 --> 3:13:15.880]  They're on the fall.
[3:13:15.880 --> 3:13:17.880]  They don't know what they're going to do.
[3:13:17.880 --> 3:13:22.880]  They're, they're so desperate actually, that Jake Tapper, one of the biggest CIA shills
[3:13:22.880 --> 3:13:26.880]  and deep state shills, had to actually ask on Twitter.
[3:13:26.880 --> 3:13:28.880]  He goes to the DNC.
[3:13:28.880 --> 3:13:31.880]  Why didn't you give your hard drive to the FBI?
[3:13:31.880 --> 3:13:36.880]  Even the fake news and fake taper at CNN is realizing, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[3:13:36.880 --> 3:13:38.880]  The winds are blowing a different way.
[3:13:38.880 --> 3:13:41.880]  I better try to ask a real news question, a Patriot question.
[3:13:41.880 --> 3:13:45.880]  Of course, the answer is there's child pornography on those DNC servers.
[3:13:45.880 --> 3:13:48.880]  You know, they're all, you know, God knows what kind of sick stuff they're doing there.
[3:13:48.880 --> 3:13:52.880]  That's why they never handed it over to the FBI for sure.
[3:13:52.880 --> 3:13:55.880]  Now I'm going to get out here and give you your time, but I promise next month we're
[3:13:55.880 --> 3:13:56.880]  getting the new shows launched.
[3:13:56.880 --> 3:13:57.880]  You're going to be hosting every day.
[3:13:57.880 --> 3:13:58.880]  We're really excited about that.
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:00.880]  Have you told me the time yet you want to host?
[3:14:00.880 --> 3:14:02.880]  You want to host right after the show at what?
[3:14:02.880 --> 3:14:03.880]  Three o'clock central?
[3:14:03.880 --> 3:14:04.880]  Yeah.
[3:14:04.880 --> 3:14:08.880]  I'll probably do the fourth hour, the way we're doing it now just Monday through Friday,
[3:14:08.880 --> 3:14:09.880]  the current hour.
[3:14:09.880 --> 3:14:11.880]  But I mean, there's so much going on.
[3:14:11.880 --> 3:14:12.880]  There's so much raw talent.
[3:14:12.880 --> 3:14:18.880]  There's so much energy and enthusiasm that there's so much, there's so many people out
[3:14:18.880 --> 3:14:21.880]  there hungry for the truth that we can't, we can't even meet the demand.
[3:14:21.880 --> 3:14:25.880]  So we're going to have to figure out, you know, who else is going to be involved with this
[3:14:25.880 --> 3:14:28.880]  because for example, I was in Washington, DC.
[3:14:28.880 --> 3:14:29.880]  I'm out here.
[3:14:29.880 --> 3:14:33.880]  I got some major stories, but I can't, I can't release them yet because then they'll be able
[3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:35.880]  to find out, you know, all my secret sources.
[3:14:35.880 --> 3:14:40.880]  But I'm just sitting down and joining a cigar with some friends and every five minutes,
[3:14:40.880 --> 3:14:43.880]  Sernovich, Sernovich, how are you?
[3:14:43.880 --> 3:14:48.880]  And again, like not bragging like when I was with you at Austin, the whole restaurant stops
[3:14:48.880 --> 3:14:49.880]  and looks.
[3:14:49.880 --> 3:14:50.880]  It's not bragging.
[3:14:50.880 --> 3:14:53.880]  It shows the success of the Liberty movement.
[3:14:53.880 --> 3:14:54.880]  Exactly.
[3:14:54.880 --> 3:14:55.880]  It shows the success.
[3:14:55.880 --> 3:14:59.880]  And that's the issue is when I was out with Megan Kelly, I'm not bragging.
[3:14:59.880 --> 3:15:01.880]  More people said, there's Alex Jones.
[3:15:01.880 --> 3:15:02.880]  They weren't pointing at me.
[3:15:02.880 --> 3:15:04.880]  It's not that I want to be the big celebrity.
[3:15:04.880 --> 3:15:06.880]  Quite frankly, I wish I wasn't seen in public.
[3:15:06.880 --> 3:15:07.880]  I'm tired of it.
[3:15:07.880 --> 3:15:09.880]  But I see it as we're hurting the globalist.
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:10.880]  They're scared.
[3:15:10.880 --> 3:15:11.880]  They're coming after us.
[3:15:11.880 --> 3:15:16.880]  Since you mentioned that, I'm going to play J. Johnson, not please DNA, refuse DHS help.
[3:15:16.880 --> 3:15:19.880]  Now Debbie Washington Schultz has come out and said, he's a liar.
[3:15:19.880 --> 3:15:21.880]  So the rats are turning on each other.
[3:15:21.880 --> 3:15:22.880]  Here it is.
[3:15:22.880 --> 3:15:28.880]  As to what was offered them, what they accepted, was there any level of cooperation at all?
[3:15:28.880 --> 3:15:32.880]  To my disappointment, not to my knowledge, sir.
[3:15:32.880 --> 3:15:35.880]  And this is a question I asked repeatedly when I first learned of it.
[3:15:35.880 --> 3:15:36.880]  You know, what are we doing?
[3:15:36.880 --> 3:15:38.880]  Are we in there?
[3:15:38.880 --> 3:15:40.880]  Are we helping them discover the vulnerabilities?
[3:15:40.880 --> 3:15:44.880]  Because this was fresh off the OPM experience.
[3:15:44.880 --> 3:15:51.880]  And there was a point at which DHS cybersecurity experts did get into OPM and actually help
[3:15:51.880 --> 3:15:58.880]  them discover the bad actors and patch some of the exfiltrations or at least minimize
[3:15:58.880 --> 3:15:59.880]  some of the damage.
[3:15:59.880 --> 3:16:02.880]  And so I was anxious to know whether or not our folks were in there.
[3:16:02.880 --> 3:16:07.880]  And the response I got was, FBI had spoken to them.
[3:16:07.880 --> 3:16:08.880]  They don't want our help.
[3:16:08.880 --> 3:16:10.880]  They have crowd strike.
[3:16:10.880 --> 3:16:17.880]  You have an unprecedented amount of cyber hacking by foreign power, an adversary from my point of view.
[3:16:17.880 --> 3:16:22.880]  And they were not going to accept all the money they were given.
[3:16:22.880 --> 3:16:25.880]  They had Google, Facebook, everybody against Trump.
[3:16:25.880 --> 3:16:28.880]  The Russians, like it was a Republican administration.
[3:16:28.880 --> 3:16:30.880]  Yeah, the Russians were tacitly for Trump.
[3:16:30.880 --> 3:16:32.880]  What the frickin' do?
[3:16:32.880 --> 3:16:34.880]  Governmental entity, FBI, DHS.
[3:16:34.880 --> 3:16:35.880]  And they didn't accept that.
[3:16:35.880 --> 3:16:36.880]  Hope.
[3:16:36.880 --> 3:16:38.880]  The Chai comms, the EU, all against Trump.
[3:16:38.880 --> 3:16:43.880]  My interest in helping them was definitely a non-partisan interest.
[3:16:43.880 --> 3:16:56.880]  And I recall very clearly that I was not pleased that we were not in there helping them patch this vulnerability.
[3:16:56.880 --> 3:17:00.880]  Oh, so the Democrats literally were naked, wide open.
[3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:01.880]  Hillary had her own server.
[3:17:01.880 --> 3:17:03.880]  She was putting stuff on there for sale.
[3:17:03.880 --> 3:17:04.880]  She knew it was compromise.
[3:17:04.880 --> 3:17:05.880]  She put the classified stuff on.
[3:17:05.880 --> 3:17:06.880]  She got it.
[3:17:06.880 --> 3:17:08.880]  That's what their foundation is.
[3:17:08.880 --> 3:17:09.880]  It's like the Legion of Doom.
[3:17:09.880 --> 3:17:15.880]  Now, here's Debbie Wasserman Schultz saying that J. Johnson, their own Homeland Security head, is wrong in their respect.
[3:17:15.880 --> 3:17:18.880]  It's on record, Homeland Security wanted to get in there.
[3:17:18.880 --> 3:17:19.880]  Here it is.
[3:17:19.880 --> 3:17:22.880]  I doubt said that the DNC refused his department's help.
[3:17:22.880 --> 3:17:23.880]  Look at Schultz.
[3:17:23.880 --> 3:17:27.880]  You put out a statement and now we're basically saying that J. Johnson was wrong.
[3:17:27.880 --> 3:17:29.880]  Where is he wrong?
[3:17:29.880 --> 3:17:31.880]  He's wrong in every respect.
[3:17:31.880 --> 3:17:33.880]  Let me just be very clear.
[3:17:33.880 --> 3:17:43.880]  At no point during my tenure at the DNC was I contacted by the FBI, DHS, or any government agency or alerted or made aware that-
[3:17:43.880 --> 3:17:45.880]  She talks like she's on painkillers.
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:49.880]  An enemy state was intruding on our network.
[3:17:49.880 --> 3:17:50.880]  At no point.
[3:17:50.880 --> 3:17:55.880]  And I am a member of Congress who had the ability to sit down and be briefed in a classified setting.
[3:17:55.880 --> 3:18:01.880]  Even Director Comey testified publicly that he wished that he had gone to the top of the organization.
[3:18:01.880 --> 3:18:04.880]  We're one of the two national political parties.
[3:18:04.880 --> 3:18:14.880]  It is astounding that when they had a member of Congress who was leading that organization that no one felt it was any more important when we had a foreign enemy intruding-
[3:18:14.880 --> 3:18:17.880]  A foreign enemy taking over.
[3:18:17.880 --> 3:18:24.880]  All we want to do is tell you out and teach your kids how to be sexual at age two and you don't like us.
[3:18:24.880 --> 3:18:28.880]  Secretary Johnson says the DNC rebuffed the help that they offered.
[3:18:28.880 --> 3:18:31.880]  You're saying that no one ever contacted you.
[3:18:31.880 --> 3:18:35.880]  Respectfully, Secretary Johnson is utterly misinformed.
[3:18:35.880 --> 3:18:37.880]  Utterly misinformed.
[3:18:37.880 --> 3:18:39.880]  Much that has been written about the timeline.
[3:18:39.880 --> 3:18:41.880]  I am hunting for rabbits.
[3:18:41.880 --> 3:18:45.880]  The New York Times, the Washington Post, that document through multiple sources including-
[3:18:45.880 --> 3:18:46.880]  Multiple sources.
[3:18:46.880 --> 3:18:56.880]  That the FBI and other federal agencies did virtually nothing to make sure that when they were aware-
[3:18:56.880 --> 3:18:57.880]  Virtually nothing.
[3:18:57.880 --> 3:18:58.880]  They did it.
[3:18:58.880 --> 3:18:59.880]  They did nothing.
[3:18:59.880 --> 3:19:01.880]  They were concerned that there was an intrusion on our network-
[3:19:01.880 --> 3:19:03.880]  A intrusion on our network?
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:06.880]  That they did virtually nothing to sound the alarm bells to make us aware-
[3:19:06.880 --> 3:19:09.880]  Welcome to a McDonald May I Help You.
[3:19:09.880 --> 3:19:10.880]  The Russians on our network for-
[3:19:10.880 --> 3:19:15.880]  Hillary was under investigation for years with the server with all the illegal crap on it.
[3:19:15.880 --> 3:19:21.880]  All of you guys, and now it's the FBI's fault that they didn't protect you from the non-existent Russians.
[3:19:21.880 --> 3:19:23.880]  The Russians could hardly keep their lights on, man.
[3:19:23.880 --> 3:19:28.880]  After globalists- Mike Sarnovich, I'm skipping this break so you have more time than I took.
[3:19:28.880 --> 3:19:29.880]  I appreciate you, buddy.
[3:19:29.880 --> 3:19:32.880]  Big stuff on DC, but what do you make of the rats leaving the sinking ship?
[3:19:32.880 --> 3:19:35.880]  What do you make of them losing the fourth special election?
[3:19:35.880 --> 3:19:38.880]  And then their answer is just kill everybody.
[3:19:38.880 --> 3:19:40.880]  Well, the Russian narrative isn't working.
[3:19:40.880 --> 3:19:43.880]  Nancy Pelosi, of course, we want to keep her in power.
[3:19:43.880 --> 3:19:44.880]  She's wonderful.
[3:19:44.880 --> 3:19:50.880]  Everything, if I could orchestrate and control what was happening there, I wouldn't change a thing.
[3:19:50.880 --> 3:19:53.880]  Let's replace her with Maxine Waters.
[3:19:53.880 --> 3:19:55.880]  Well, okay, maybe that would be better.
[3:19:55.880 --> 3:19:57.880]  That would be the only way to improve it.
[3:19:57.880 --> 3:20:00.880]  I'm very happy with the way things are going.
[3:20:00.880 --> 3:20:04.880]  I'm very happy that their high-level staffers have been caught with child pornography,
[3:20:04.880 --> 3:20:08.880]  that Anthony Wiener is a pedophile, that the message is getting out-
[3:20:08.880 --> 3:20:09.880]  That we broke that.
[3:20:09.880 --> 3:20:11.880]  Yeah, that they're loaded with pedophiles.
[3:20:11.880 --> 3:20:13.880]  That's why they didn't want to give their server over there.
[3:20:13.880 --> 3:20:16.880]  I guarantee you there was child pornography on there.
[3:20:16.880 --> 3:20:19.880]  Jacob Schwartz has somebody had some, you know, kind of images of underage people.
[3:20:19.880 --> 3:20:22.880]  That's the real reason that they never gave it to the FBI.
[3:20:22.880 --> 3:20:27.880]  So people are realizing that the DNC is loaded with child molesters, pedophiles.
[3:20:27.880 --> 3:20:30.880]  Well, they all look like child molesters.
[3:20:30.880 --> 3:20:31.880]  Exactly.
[3:20:31.880 --> 3:20:34.880]  And that's why they have no message for the American people.
[3:20:34.880 --> 3:20:37.880]  Why is it child molesters always look like child molesters?
[3:20:37.880 --> 3:20:39.880]  They never look like John Wayne.
[3:20:39.880 --> 3:20:41.880]  They never look like Donald Trump.
[3:20:41.880 --> 3:20:43.880]  They always look like child molesters.
[3:20:43.880 --> 3:20:44.880]  It's a great question.
[3:20:44.880 --> 3:20:51.880]  Physiomy, you know, you look at the facial features of somebody and you can predict a lot of things about them.
[3:20:51.880 --> 3:20:55.880]  And there is a certain look to the pedophile look.
[3:20:55.880 --> 3:20:57.880]  Yeah, they look like Dennis Astrid.
[3:20:57.880 --> 3:21:02.880]  The guy that shot Scalise from Illinois, he looks like a Dennis Astrid clone.
[3:21:02.880 --> 3:21:04.880]  I mean, he looks like a pedophile.
[3:21:04.880 --> 3:21:05.880]  Exactly.
[3:21:05.880 --> 3:21:10.880]  That's why he wanted to kill Republicans to shut down investigations in the pedophilia.
[3:21:10.880 --> 3:21:12.880]  He knew that the Democrats are his best bet.
[3:21:12.880 --> 3:21:18.880]  And another guy that looks like a pedophile, who I think he was a Nebraska guy who said that he's glad the shooting happened.
[3:21:18.880 --> 3:21:19.880]  Yeah.
[3:21:19.880 --> 3:21:26.880]  That guy, there was another guy, a video today of a Democratic operative who said that, and of course, I'm not saying he is a pedophile.
[3:21:26.880 --> 3:21:27.880]  But I'm saying-
[3:21:27.880 --> 3:21:29.880]  Doesn't Johnny Depp look like a pedophile?
[3:21:29.880 --> 3:21:32.880]  Oh, if you look at him, he definitely has that vibe.
[3:21:32.880 --> 3:21:33.880]  There's no question.
[3:21:33.880 --> 3:21:35.880]  There's no question he has the vibe.
[3:21:35.880 --> 3:21:48.880]  But yeah, so the, yeah, that's the shooter, you look at them, they look like it, right? And then there was a guy from Nebraska who was caught on an audio, leaked audio where he said that he was glad this police was shot.
[3:21:48.880 --> 3:21:51.880]  And then you look at him and he looks like Dennis Astrid too.
[3:21:51.880 --> 3:21:52.880]  Well, here's my next question.
[3:21:52.880 --> 3:21:53.880]  You're a smart guy.
[3:21:53.880 --> 3:21:54.880]  I talk a lot of smart folks.
[3:21:54.880 --> 3:21:55.880]  We're holding back.
[3:21:55.880 --> 3:21:56.880]  We don't want to be violent.
[3:21:56.880 --> 3:21:58.880]  We're winning, you know, letting them shoot congressmen and stuff.
[3:21:58.880 --> 3:21:59.880]  We try to stop it.
[3:21:59.880 --> 3:22:04.880]  But they're clearly, the left's building up for a bigger tantrum, a bigger confrontation.
[3:22:04.880 --> 3:22:07.880]  How long do we take this, though, until Trump moves against them?
[3:22:07.880 --> 3:22:12.880]  I think, you know, the folks over at Brzezinski Land on Morning Joe, they're saying, oh, watch out.
[3:22:12.880 --> 3:22:13.880]  Trump's about to become a dictator.
[3:22:13.880 --> 3:22:14.880]  No, he got elected.
[3:22:14.880 --> 3:22:21.880]  But if we have to move in a very serious way against people openly wanting to murder everybody, that's called your duty.
[3:22:21.880 --> 3:22:23.880]  I don't want to have a big shooting war.
[3:22:23.880 --> 3:22:27.880]  I don't want to have to, you know, arrest 10,000 of these people and have trials and hang their asses.
[3:22:27.880 --> 3:22:30.880]  But if it's done by a jury and we need to, I'll be there and pull the switch.
[3:22:30.880 --> 3:22:35.880]  I mean, I'm not going to sit here and, you know, just call for, you know, stuff without actually being part of it.
[3:22:35.880 --> 3:22:37.880]  I mean, how long can they keep pushing for this?
[3:22:37.880 --> 3:22:44.880]  Well, this Sunday, the domestic terrorist group Antifa is going to actually have a riot in Washington, D.C.
[3:22:44.880 --> 3:22:45.880]  in front of the police station.
[3:22:45.880 --> 3:22:50.880]  I sent the producers a picture of some graffiti that I found.
[3:22:50.880 --> 3:22:57.880]  So, yeah, this Sunday, June 25th, they're actually going to go start a riot against the D.C. police.
[3:22:57.880 --> 3:23:00.880]  So, they're setting their own trap, man.
[3:23:00.880 --> 3:23:06.880]  The police aren't going to take too kindly to this plan, to a terrorist plan that they have.
[3:23:06.880 --> 3:23:08.880]  Well, I'm just getting sick of it.
[3:23:08.880 --> 3:23:14.880]  I mean, you know, we have actual communists here in Austin marching around with guns with their fingers on the triggers.
[3:23:14.880 --> 3:23:16.880]  We have an open carry and our arrivals are pointed at the ground.
[3:23:16.880 --> 3:23:17.880]  They're not loaded.
[3:23:17.880 --> 3:23:19.880]  We're exercising it to have the right.
[3:23:19.880 --> 3:23:21.880]  We're not out there.
[3:23:21.880 --> 3:23:27.880]  I mean, my reporters are there and I'm like, watch the video where these communists have their guns like this towards the cops in my reporters.
[3:23:27.880 --> 3:23:33.880]  And I mean, I'm sorry, I can't go to these because if this guy has a gun towards me, I'm going to attack him because that's an act of aggression.
[3:23:33.880 --> 3:23:34.880]  That's menacing me.
[3:23:34.880 --> 3:23:37.880]  Under state law, his ass needs to be arrested.
[3:23:37.880 --> 3:23:40.880]  So, I'm Mr. Anti-Police State when they're left as control.
[3:23:40.880 --> 3:23:45.880]  But if you're going to have dangerous violent groups trying to start a civil war, it needs to be nipped in the bud now.
[3:23:45.880 --> 3:23:51.880]  This is racketeering under every federal and state law, the Democrats and all of them are clear and present danger.
[3:23:51.880 --> 3:23:59.880]  And I can tell you, Special Operations, the Pentagon, you name it, still has moles in it from Obama, but in general, 90% are ready.
[3:23:59.880 --> 3:24:03.880]  If a civil war starts, there is a big Christmas list of these leftists.
[3:24:03.880 --> 3:24:05.880]  So, I hope everyone of them that wants violence and war knows this.
[3:24:05.880 --> 3:24:10.880]  I'm not going to talk about what people are planning in defense of this, but you just know this.
[3:24:10.880 --> 3:24:12.880]  This is a two-way street.
[3:24:12.880 --> 3:24:18.880]  Yeah, there's also an Antifa terrorist group in Phoenix, Arizona, and they have a gun club.
[3:24:18.880 --> 3:24:27.880]  And on their message boards and their private WhatsApp groups and everything, they've said that they need to do more tactical training to kind of murder people, essentially.
[3:24:27.880 --> 3:24:29.880]  And so, what I believe...
[3:24:29.880 --> 3:24:34.880]  That's right. They're very upset at the Huffington Post and their places that the guy wasn't tactically better.
[3:24:34.880 --> 3:24:35.880]  They weren't more dead.
[3:24:35.880 --> 3:24:39.880]  They all bemoaned that, the hunting, the Republicans, they said, too bad there wasn't more.
[3:24:39.880 --> 3:24:41.880]  You know, we'd be more dead.
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:45.880]  Yeah, and one thing, this is probably the only thing keeping me alive.
[3:24:45.880 --> 3:24:53.880]  I was actually met by a very menacing, reptilian, pedophile kind of person on one of my trips, and he came forward and he wanted to give me a warning.
[3:24:53.880 --> 3:25:00.880]  So, I handed him a slip of paper on it, and I'm not going to say what names were on it, but there were 10 names on it.
[3:25:00.880 --> 3:25:10.880]  And I said, just so you know, if anything happens to me, that's going to go all points, bulletin, that these are the 10 people that are going to be deemed responsible for my death and my murder.
[3:25:10.880 --> 3:25:15.880]  So, you make sure that that gives up the food chain to the people that you're acting on your behalf for.
[3:25:15.880 --> 3:25:18.880]  And he freaked out. It looked like he was like a ghost hit him.
[3:25:18.880 --> 3:25:26.880]  And I said, yeah, if you think you're just going to kill me and have me disappear, know that these 10 people, it's a dead man switch.
[3:25:26.880 --> 3:25:34.880]  I go, these 10 people are going to be held accountable for it, and you just make sure that they know if that's how you want to play and something happens to me.
[3:25:34.880 --> 3:25:41.880]  And there are a lot of people who that list will be made public. And then what happens after you murder me, I won't have any sympathy for you.
[3:25:41.880 --> 3:25:46.880]  Let's get a little bit more into this, because these people always think when they threaten you, it doesn't scare you. It freaks them out.
[3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:50.880]  And I'm not bragging, but I'm the next person threatens me. I'm punching them right in the throat.
[3:25:50.880 --> 3:25:56.880]  I mean, so you're not a wimpy guy yourself. You're a big guy. So like, I mean, describe what this was like.
[3:25:56.880 --> 3:26:07.880]  Okay. So he was very, he had that kind of sunken in creepy face that we, you know, that we all know of a little bit too polished, a little bit too smooth, sunken in.
[3:26:07.880 --> 3:26:12.880]  He was skinny and lanky with these long kind of features. Psychopathic traits.
[3:26:12.880 --> 3:26:19.880]  Yeah. Yeah. The typical, like you can look at that and he had a sociopathic thing and he came up and he's Michael Cernovich.
[3:26:19.880 --> 3:26:29.880]  And you, you get chills down your neck when these people talk to you because you can feel their, the energy or vibe. And I was like, yeah, I really was like, I was like, what is this?
[3:26:29.880 --> 3:26:35.880]  And he goes, so you've been very busy looking at things, haven't you? And I go, what are you talking about, man?
[3:26:35.880 --> 3:26:41.880]  He goes, you know that you're a little bit closer to some of these things than you should be. Some of these stories you're on.
[3:26:41.880 --> 3:26:45.880]  We've let you go farther than you probably should be allowed to go.
[3:26:45.880 --> 3:26:50.880]  And I go, okay. So what are you saying? Cause I'm a big put it on the table kind of guy. I'm like, what are you saying?
[3:26:50.880 --> 3:26:56.880]  He's like, well, there are a lot of people very disturbed by the things that you're looking into and that creepy little vibe.
[3:26:56.880 --> 3:27:02.880]  So then I just, I had a pen on me and I said, you know, hold on a second. I said, hold on a second. Woo.
[3:27:02.880 --> 3:27:07.880]  And he stood there and you know, they're very still and cold. Again, they don't even feel humans.
[3:27:07.880 --> 3:27:16.880]  So he had a little, yeah. So I took a pen out and I had a little scratch piece of paper and I wrote down. And then you accidentally did this with the pen, just in his throat?
[3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:20.880]  No, because I knew that they were going to know I'm joking. I'm joking. Go ahead. We never want that.
[3:27:20.880 --> 3:27:30.880]  But so what I did is I wrote 10 names on and I said, these are the 10 people I want you to know that if I am murdered, these 10 people will be held responsible.
[3:27:30.880 --> 3:27:37.880]  And suddenly he looked at me and then he did not like that. He gave me a look and stir it away.
[3:27:37.880 --> 3:27:44.880]  Because I don't know if he thought he was just going to scare me, but the names of the people that were on that list.
[3:27:44.880 --> 3:27:49.880]  Those are the kind of attention you're going to take over here. Let me add one more thing.
[3:27:49.880 --> 3:27:53.880]  We're talking about how we fund ourselves. Evil shampoo, evil toothpaste.
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:28:00.880]  Toothpaste is now overall the best seller of the pharmaceuticals. It's the super male, profit-wise, but the brain force overall sells.
[3:28:00.880 --> 3:28:02.880]  But we have very little profit on that.
[3:28:02.880 --> 3:28:09.880]  Big article in Atlantic Monthly, which is the elite publication calling for overthrowing Trump, testosterone wars, basically saying I'm a criminal.
[3:28:09.880 --> 3:28:17.880]  I need to be shut down. I'm a horrible person. I'm selling a product that's sold under another label, you know, with Whole Foods and on Amazon.
[3:28:17.880 --> 3:28:23.880]  Bezos can sell all this stuff, but I can. What hypocritical, pathetic worms. But they are so upset.
[3:28:23.880 --> 3:28:29.880]  They don't understand. I could fund myself with any mechanism. I can flip a switch and raise $500 million right now.
[3:28:29.880 --> 3:28:31.880]  They just don't get it, do they?
[3:28:31.880 --> 3:28:37.880]  Well, that's another thing that I find endlessly amusing is you can walk down Whole Foods.
[3:28:37.880 --> 3:28:42.880]  Amazon sells supplements. Whole Foods sells it. Trader Joe sells it. Pharmaceuticals.
[3:28:42.880 --> 3:28:43.880]  Because they work.
[3:28:43.880 --> 3:28:51.880]  Right. But the point is, where's the expose on Whole Foods selling supplements, selling the same things you sell, selling the Emmerich's essential?
[3:28:51.880 --> 3:28:56.880]  You can buy citrus-based products that everybody knows there's something called dead.
[3:28:56.880 --> 3:29:00.880]  You can buy my entire Emmerich's Essentials line at Whole Foods. It's one of their top sellers probably will buy us.
[3:29:00.880 --> 3:29:05.880]  So why is my sunscreen evil, or why is my vitamins evil, but theirs is good?
[3:29:05.880 --> 3:29:10.880]  And the thing is, the left knows supplements work. It's one of the few things they're smart about.
[3:29:10.880 --> 3:29:16.880]  Well, they just want to do anything to attack you. It's just you get used to it at this point.
[3:29:16.880 --> 3:29:22.880]  If you sold people bottled water, they would say, well, bottled water is a scam.
[3:29:22.880 --> 3:29:24.880]  You're like, well, wait a minute. Everybody sells bottled water.
[3:29:24.880 --> 3:29:33.880]  If you sold silverware or plates or computers or iPhones or whatever, then they would immediately say, oh, well, that's a scam, and that doesn't really work.
[3:29:33.880 --> 3:29:36.880]  Yeah, well, you know why TechX2, it works. Free shipping running through July 4th.
[3:29:36.880 --> 3:29:41.880]  We're starting to take over. Great job, my friend. It was great having you here in Austin. We're getting ready to launch the next level.
[3:29:41.880 --> 3:29:44.880]  They know it. They got all our phones tapped. They know. They know what's going on.
[3:29:44.880 --> 3:30:07.880]  All right, Mike Cernum is coming up. Stay with us.
[3:30:15.880 --> 3:30:26.880]  I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend, somebody that I've gotten to know very well, Steve Scalise.
[3:30:26.880 --> 3:30:32.880]  Right? Because that's the only reason you would try to interrupt a president as he was sending out his thoughts and prayers to somebody who had recently been shot.
[3:30:32.880 --> 3:30:41.880]  Right? Come on, work with me here. The Democrats can't even protest right. These people fail at everything. They lose elections, they lose public support, and now they look like thoughtless cowards.
[3:30:41.880 --> 3:30:46.880]  It's just as Trump said. Never fails. Never fails.
[3:30:46.880 --> 3:30:52.880]  You can check out the video on Infowars.com. Protesters blow whistles as Trump sends thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise.
[3:30:52.880 --> 3:30:58.880]  And that part about both Clinton being in the audience? That was fake news. Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[3:30:58.880 --> 3:31:07.880]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[3:31:07.880 --> 3:31:15.880]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[3:31:15.880 --> 3:31:20.880]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[3:31:20.880 --> 3:31:27.880]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:31:27.880 --> 3:31:34.880]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[3:31:34.880 --> 3:31:41.880]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[3:31:41.880 --> 3:31:46.880]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[3:31:46.880 --> 3:31:55.880]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend. You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[3:31:55.880 --> 3:31:58.880]  Available at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:31:58.880 --> 3:32:04.880]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:32:04.880 --> 3:32:09.880]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week. I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[3:32:09.880 --> 3:32:14.880]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[3:32:14.880 --> 3:32:17.880]  Research across the board is clear. In fact, it's certified.
[3:32:17.880 --> 3:32:22.880]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[3:32:22.880 --> 3:32:29.880]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[3:32:29.880 --> 3:32:32.880]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[3:32:32.880 --> 3:32:35.880]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[3:32:35.880 --> 3:32:42.880]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[3:32:42.880 --> 3:32:50.880]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts, include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[3:32:50.880 --> 3:32:55.880]  Learn more about InfoWarsLife Super Blue toothpaste at InfoWarsLife.com
[3:32:55.880 --> 3:32:58.880]  and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[3:32:58.880 --> 3:33:11.880]  News, analysis, reports. It's the Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Mike Cernovich.
[3:33:11.880 --> 3:33:17.880]  And we're back. Welcome back. Mike Cernovich here.
[3:33:17.880 --> 3:33:25.880]  Apologize for the hair. It got rained on in D.C. I wasn't expecting the weather, so we got to get this hair fixed up.
[3:33:25.880 --> 3:33:31.880]  But that aside, we have some cool things planned just so you know if you're in the Washington, D.C. area.
[3:33:31.880 --> 3:33:38.880]  Tonight, we're hosting a, we call them a MAGA meetup. These are very important events to connect with other like-minded patriots.
[3:33:38.880 --> 3:33:43.880]  We always have a great turnout. There's a picture on my Twitter of the kind of people who show up.
[3:33:43.880 --> 3:33:51.880]  It's always a great time. That is, tonight, Friday at 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time in Washington, D.C., at the Trump Hotel.
[3:33:51.880 --> 3:33:57.880]  Just come on out. We're on the bar area. We just hang out. There's always, you know, 50 or 100 of us connecting.
[3:33:57.880 --> 3:34:01.880]  So yeah, there's a picture from the last time. We always have a good time.
[3:34:01.880 --> 3:34:07.880]  Community is important because the fake news media wants you to feel isolated, and that's not even everybody who shows up.
[3:34:07.880 --> 3:34:10.880]  There's always way more people there, but not everybody wants to be in a picture.
[3:34:10.880 --> 3:34:15.880]  So the fake news media wants you to feel like you're isolating alone and we're everywhere.
[3:34:15.880 --> 3:34:21.880]  And that's, again, why I talk about being recognized in public. It isn't a brag or even that I care.
[3:34:21.880 --> 3:34:25.880]  Just every time I'm recognized in public, that's a patriot right there.
[3:34:25.880 --> 3:34:31.880]  Every time somebody says, hey, Sernovich, I know right away, wow, there's another, even in D.C., the swamp.
[3:34:31.880 --> 3:34:36.880]  We're in the swamp right now. Patriots everywhere you go. Tonight, they'll be patriots everywhere.
[3:34:36.880 --> 3:34:44.880]  And then Sunday and noon, we're hosting a rally, a rally against political violence in front of the White House.
[3:34:44.880 --> 3:34:48.880]  I have heard that actually, Enfield Wars may be live streaming the entire event.
[3:34:48.880 --> 3:34:53.880]  I don't have final confirmation on that, but we were, you know, out of periscopes and YouTube Live and everything.
[3:34:53.880 --> 3:34:59.880]  And that is this coming Sunday at noon, it is a rally against political violence.
[3:34:59.880 --> 3:35:03.880]  Jack Pesovic will be there. Roger Stone is going to be there.
[3:35:03.880 --> 3:35:07.880]  Laura Loomer, who you saw from Shakespeare in the park. Cassandra Fairbanks, Lucian Winthrops.
[3:35:07.880 --> 3:35:15.880]  Mike Flynn Jr., Ali, Anna Kate, Mike Sernovich. It's going to be a big event. We're going to have a lot of people.
[3:35:15.880 --> 3:35:22.880]  It is going to be a lot of fun. And that is this Sunday, June 25th at noon in front of the White House.
[3:35:22.880 --> 3:35:30.880]  And you can find that information on the Facebook page or, you know, follow at twitter.com forward slash C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H all over there.
[3:35:30.880 --> 3:35:41.880]  Now, the reason we hold these events is because you feel alone because everywhere you're bombarded with violence in Hollywood, fake news,
[3:35:41.880 --> 3:35:46.880]  they make it seem like we're some kind of French movement. They make it seem like there are only a few people.
[3:35:46.880 --> 3:35:52.880]  We're actually, I'm more mainstream than people in the mainstream. Alex is more mainstream than I am.
[3:35:52.880 --> 3:36:02.880]  There are patriots everywhere. So our job is to connect all of you. And there's also a hashtag M-A-G-A-M-E-E-T-U-P-S,
[3:36:02.880 --> 3:36:08.880]  MAGA Meetups. Not UPS like the store. It's more like ups. So MAGA Meetups is a hashtag.
[3:36:08.880 --> 3:36:15.880]  So if you want to start a local event or you want to meet like-minded patriots in whatever city, you can just go on Twitter
[3:36:15.880 --> 3:36:24.880]  and type in hashtag MAGA Meetups or you can follow the Twitter account at MAGA M-E-E-T-U-P-S.
[3:36:24.880 --> 3:36:32.880]  So the important thing is we have to unite as patriots. And we also, we have to network with each other too.
[3:36:32.880 --> 3:36:40.880]  We all know everybody, here's the official MAGA Meetups page. You can follow MAGA M-E-E-T-U-P-S on Twitter
[3:36:40.880 --> 3:36:46.880]  because everybody listening to this knows that feeling that what if people find out I'm a patriot?
[3:36:46.880 --> 3:36:52.880]  If my job finds out I'm a patriot, I'm going to be fired. If people find out I'm a patriot, maybe they're going to be violent.
[3:36:52.880 --> 3:37:01.880]  Who knows what is going to happen? It's so important that we connect with other like-minded people in the real world.
[3:37:01.880 --> 3:37:07.880]  That's very, very important. And by the way, Alex has been very generous in helping to sponsor these events.
[3:37:07.880 --> 3:37:14.880]  And that's why the infowarstore.com is so crucial is a lot of people like, oh, you know, if I go to the store, what does even matter?
[3:37:14.880 --> 3:37:19.880]  This is the kind of thing to get the coverage. This is what pays for events.
[3:37:19.880 --> 3:37:26.880]  This is what gets people out to Washington, D.C. to do a live stream of these rallies that not everybody can attend to.
[3:37:26.880 --> 3:37:34.880]  So even when you can't make it out of the house and you can't make it to one of our events by supporting the broadcast at infowarstore.com
[3:37:34.880 --> 3:37:40.880]  and buying the toothpaste and taking the new tropics and all the great testosterone products,
[3:37:40.880 --> 3:37:45.880]  you're actually bringing more people together because we are the resistance.
[3:37:45.880 --> 3:37:53.880]  Speaking of the resistance, we now are going to have Katie McQ on, who she was actually recently fired from Breitbart over a tweet
[3:37:53.880 --> 3:38:00.880]  which based on what Breitbart writes and the articles that they write, a lot of people would think, well, wait a minute, why was she fired
[3:38:00.880 --> 3:38:08.880]  for tweeting out essentially what Breitbart talks about all the time, which is the link between radical Islam and terrorism.
[3:38:08.880 --> 3:38:11.880]  So if Katie's on the line, how are you doing?
[3:38:11.880 --> 3:38:12.880]  How are you doing, Mike?
[3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:15.880]  Doing great. Thank you for being able to make it today.
[3:38:15.880 --> 3:38:17.880]  Yeah, well, thank you for having me on.
[3:38:17.880 --> 3:38:21.880]  So for those of you who don't know, maybe briefly introduce yourself.
[3:38:21.880 --> 3:38:25.880]  My name is Katie McQ. I worked for Breitbart for about three years.
[3:38:25.880 --> 3:38:34.880]  I was a homepage editor, a radio producer, a reporter, copy editor, you know, sort of a jack of all trades, and I worked very closely with Steve Bannon
[3:38:34.880 --> 3:38:37.880]  and that was an incredible experience.
[3:38:37.880 --> 3:38:48.880]  However, the company has certainly changed since he left because his personality was the driving force behind, you know, Nationalist Populist Movement and Breitbart News itself.
[3:38:48.880 --> 3:38:52.880]  And you helped him with his XM radio show, right?
[3:38:52.880 --> 3:38:59.880]  Yes, he picked me out of everyone in the company and said it was a great honor.
[3:38:59.880 --> 3:39:03.880]  So it was so great to work for a boss who was, you know, total pedal to the metal.
[3:39:03.880 --> 3:39:07.880]  Everything he did was for the audience, for the callers, for our readers.
[3:39:07.880 --> 3:39:11.880]  And at the same time, we were totally ideologically aligned.
[3:39:11.880 --> 3:39:16.880]  So what is that like a little bit? What is it like working with somebody like Steve Bannon?
[3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:25.880]  Steve is always on. I think he sleeps about two hours a night. So, you know, him and Trump both have that kind of extremely high energy kind of lifestyle.
[3:39:25.880 --> 3:39:31.880]  You know, Trump himself sleeps about four hours a night. Steve would get up at 2am, work on show prep for four hours.
[3:39:31.880 --> 3:39:34.880]  I would get up at 5am, immediately mail him the show clock.
[3:39:34.880 --> 3:39:40.880]  Then he would do three hours of radio and we'd book, you know, sometimes nine guests, sometimes 10.
[3:39:40.880 --> 3:39:43.880]  Well, at the same time, he's taking all these calls from people across the country.
[3:39:43.880 --> 3:39:48.880]  And then he would get on our 9am editorial call and then circle back with radio at 9.30 in the morning.
[3:39:48.880 --> 3:39:53.880]  And so that's all before 10am. And some people haven't even woken up by then.
[3:39:53.880 --> 3:40:01.880]  So, and Steve, Steve is just absolutely brilliant, has so much vision, and he keeps his promises too.
[3:40:01.880 --> 3:40:07.880]  Because you can see in the White House, he still has that whiteboard up left of everything he wants to accomplish in Trump's first term.
[3:40:07.880 --> 3:40:09.880]  And he keeps track of all these things and checks them off.
[3:40:09.880 --> 3:40:14.880]  So, he has your back. He'll never betray you. And he was just a fabulous boss.
[3:40:14.880 --> 3:40:18.880]  So, I'm glad that you mentioned that because it is fake news.
[3:40:18.880 --> 3:40:27.880]  The fake news narrative with Steve Bannon is he's some like shlubby guy who just lays around and hides out and doesn't really work.
[3:40:27.880 --> 3:40:29.880]  So, you're saying that that's completely fake news?
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:33.880]  That is absolutely fake news. Steve is the hardest working man I've ever met in my life.
[3:40:33.880 --> 3:40:43.880]  And, you know, just because he's not in front of the camera all the time, you know, doing press briefings doesn't mean that he's just sitting around on his butt, you know, not helping to make America great again.
[3:40:43.880 --> 3:40:46.880]  That's totally false. Totally fake news.
[3:40:46.880 --> 3:40:56.880]  Yeah, I'm so glad you say that because a lot of people don't appreciate too the how much work and preparation and everything goes in, you know, something like Alex Jones or something like Steve Bannon.
[3:40:56.880 --> 3:41:06.880]  And you don't just show up and talk. You have to be, you have to be addicted and it has to be kind of like your life, passion, life purpose or you're going to burn out.
[3:41:06.880 --> 3:41:09.880]  And Steve definitely has always had that vision, hasn't he?
[3:41:09.880 --> 3:41:21.880]  Yes, he has. And, you know, the company was his life. And even just producing the radio show with him, you know, you have to be, you're up at five, you're working on the show, you're following up with callers who call into the show with news tips.
[3:41:21.880 --> 3:41:27.880]  You're thinking of the next guest for the next day while tracking the news cycle, trying to plan the flow for the show.
[3:41:27.880 --> 3:41:37.880]  So yeah, you have to be on all the time. And I just find all these descriptions in the fake news media. Steve is like some slovenly person, just despicable. They're very offensive.
[3:41:37.880 --> 3:41:40.880]  He's also an avid reader, hasn't he?
[3:41:40.880 --> 3:41:47.880]  Yes, he is always reading and like Trump is, you know, his mind is plastic. He never stops learning. And he's always digesting new books.
[3:41:47.880 --> 3:41:56.880]  And when I was producing the show with him, we were getting constant inflow of new books and, you know, so my reading has been a voraciously while working for him.
[3:41:56.880 --> 3:42:04.880]  So it's amazing because while he's doing all this work, he still takes like an hour or so every day to read something new, learn something new.
[3:42:04.880 --> 3:42:11.880]  And I think that's a great model for all of us, you know, all of us patriots. That's something that, you know, that's a habit we should have.
[3:42:11.880 --> 3:42:20.880]  Yeah. And that's one story that has actually bothered me is that Steve Bannon is one of the few actual public intellectuals that we have.
[3:42:20.880 --> 3:42:27.880]  And conservative media never gave him his credit. They would talk about William F. Buckley or, you know, Rich Lowry is not an intellectual.
[3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:32.880]  He's not an interesting person. Nobody at National Review is doing anything interesting.
[3:42:32.880 --> 3:42:43.880]  But there was never a media narrative about Steve Bannon giving him the credit he deserves as probably one of the most great right-wing intellectuals of our time.
[3:42:43.880 --> 3:42:50.880]  Oh, I totally agree. And I think, you know, they're making the same mistake as Trump by trying to call him like unkept and lazy.
[3:42:50.880 --> 3:42:55.880]  You know, because Steve is, you know, Steve's a genius and he is, he's a predator.
[3:42:55.880 --> 3:42:59.880]  And so I think they're just drastically underestimating him and that's going to hurt them.
[3:42:59.880 --> 3:43:05.880]  I also think it's interesting too that I think Steve is the only person who's gotten in trouble and bad press for his reading list.
[3:43:05.880 --> 3:43:10.880]  I've never seen the press go after someone for reading books that they didn't like.
[3:43:10.880 --> 3:43:17.880]  So, you know, they want to even censor that and make sure that, you know, patriots like us can't connect and can't even, you know, just share book ideas.
[3:43:17.880 --> 3:43:28.880]  Yeah. It was interesting that the media was triggered that he was reading a book called The Best and the Brightest, which is an ironically titled book because the people that we consider the best and the brightest
[3:43:28.880 --> 3:43:36.880]  during the Vietnam era, the Harvard kids, Yale kids, Ivy Leaguers, they were actually the people who led us to this catastrophic failure in Vietnam.
[3:43:36.880 --> 3:43:43.880]  And we sort of have the same thing going on with the neocons and the Harvard kids that will go to Iraq or go to Afghanistan.
[3:43:43.880 --> 3:43:48.880]  The people that we view as the best and the brightest, the so-called elite, they aren't elite at all.
[3:43:48.880 --> 3:43:57.880]  So the media was really triggered that he was reading a book because they view themselves as the best and the brightest, even though they're not unique or interesting at all.
[3:43:57.880 --> 3:44:03.880]  I mean, you work in DC media. Is it true that they all kind of think alike and they're kind of boring to hang out with?
[3:44:03.880 --> 3:44:09.880]  Yeah, they are. And you can see this play out on Twitter, too, where all the little blue checks are retweeting each other, making snarky comments.
[3:44:09.880 --> 3:44:14.880]  You know, it's all just a game to them. Steve is a very serious person, which is why, you know, he's reading it.
[3:44:14.880 --> 3:44:21.880]  And I think that offends the media because they realize that they're being shown up by someone who works much harder than them, is much smarter than them.
[3:44:21.880 --> 3:44:28.880]  That's why they hate Alex, too, is they want to dismiss him as, you know, whatever, but he's always on.
[3:44:28.880 --> 3:44:36.880]  You know, he never stops thinking. So we need, you know, we need more positive attention to the virtues of these kind of public figures.
[3:44:36.880 --> 3:44:39.880]  And again, that's the story that it's incumbent upon us to tell.
[3:44:39.880 --> 3:44:43.880]  So you would mention Steve had a killer instinct. Now, here's what I've heard.
[3:44:43.880 --> 3:44:47.880]  And I'm going to qualify this for all the drama mongers at home.
[3:44:47.880 --> 3:44:56.880]  I want Breitbart to succeed. I am happy Breitbart exists. I have linked to Breitbart and sent probably at least a million clicks to their site.
[3:44:56.880 --> 3:45:02.880]  I am not hating on or shading Breitbart. However, as a journalist, I will tell you what I have heard.
[3:45:02.880 --> 3:45:08.880]  I have heard that once Bannon left, Breitbart is now being run by lawyers.
[3:45:08.880 --> 3:45:17.880]  Yes, that's true. And I want Breitbart to succeed as well. I want to go back to Andrew's vision and I want to have Steve's energy. I really wish them all the best.
[3:45:17.880 --> 3:45:25.880]  However, I think that they're nervous about the intense media scrutiny on them, since Steve, of course, went to go work for Trump and his White House chief strategist.
[3:45:25.880 --> 3:45:29.880]  So they stopped following up on a critical narrative set, got big play under Steve.
[3:45:29.880 --> 3:45:34.880]  For example, that horrible gang rape of that little disabled girl in a Twin Falls, Idaho.
[3:45:34.880 --> 3:45:39.880]  Management did not want to touch stories like that because they are pretty radioactive and they are explosive.
[3:45:39.880 --> 3:45:45.880]  But this is what the people want. And this is something that a nationalist, populist minded group should discuss.
[3:45:45.880 --> 3:45:50.880]  We should ask about why are these third world refugees here? Why are they living in slums?
[3:45:50.880 --> 3:45:56.880]  Why are they giving cheap labor to, you know, different factories and while little girls are getting raped?
[3:45:56.880 --> 3:46:00.880]  Do we vote for this? Do we ask for this? Why don't communities have any control over that?
[3:46:00.880 --> 3:46:05.880]  And it's just surprising to me that Breitbart is shying away from that kind of critical discussion.
[3:46:05.880 --> 3:46:07.880]  Why do you think that is?
[3:46:07.880 --> 3:46:16.880]  I think because, well, in the case of the Chobani Yoga Factory, which is located near Twin Falls, the person running it is of a Turkish descent.
[3:46:16.880 --> 3:46:22.880]  I think he's a citizen. He was naturalized and he likes hiring a lot of these refugees on the cheap to keep producing his yogurt.
[3:46:22.880 --> 3:46:30.880]  However, a lot of these people are very litigious and I just think Breitbart has, you know, a lot to worry about right now with their advertisers, things like that.
[3:46:30.880 --> 3:46:34.880]  And they don't want an expensive lawsuit, you know, to come crashing down their heads.
[3:46:34.880 --> 3:46:42.880]  I've also heard too, and this is what, the way I interpreted Breitbart as run by lawyers is as a lawyer myself and working with lawyers.
[3:46:42.880 --> 3:46:47.880]  If you want to be told why you can't do something, then ask a lawyer for advice.
[3:46:47.880 --> 3:46:52.880]  If you say, I want to start a media company, they'll give you 10 reasons why it's a bad idea.
[3:46:52.880 --> 3:46:55.880]  Lawyers are not visionaries. Lawyers are risk averse.
[3:46:55.880 --> 3:47:05.880]  And they, you know, they focus on that 1% of the risk and say, well, you better not, you better not take this shot because there's this downside risk that maybe was only 1%.
[3:47:05.880 --> 3:47:12.880]  So I interpreted Breitbart as run by lawyers to mean that they don't want to take big risks anymore.
[3:47:12.880 --> 3:47:18.880]  That's exactly right. And there's nothing wrong with that mindset, but that's dramatically different than what Steve did.
[3:47:18.880 --> 3:47:27.880]  You know, I can't see Breitbart with a kind of, you know, truly, like I said, killer instinct right now because they are concerned about so much risk.
[3:47:27.880 --> 3:47:30.880]  And the story, so what was like the assignment?
[3:47:30.880 --> 3:47:35.880]  Like, I know for a fact that they had a major story. I'm not going to scoop them.
[3:47:35.880 --> 3:47:42.880]  But I know for a fact that they had a major story that would have sent shockwaves. It's a national security story.
[3:47:42.880 --> 3:47:49.880]  It would have sent shockwaves all through DC and they decided not to run it.
[3:47:49.880 --> 3:47:53.880]  Are big time stories getting killed inside Breitbart?
[3:47:53.880 --> 3:47:59.880]  Well, Breitbart had an approval process and some stories would just inexplicably never get approved.
[3:47:59.880 --> 3:48:06.880]  They sit there for hours, even simple things like I was trying to write up an FBI report, internal report, not classified.
[3:48:06.880 --> 3:48:12.880]  That came out saying that the media is directly responsible for these executions of cops in the streets.
[3:48:12.880 --> 3:48:17.880]  You know, there's 50, 60 cops that were murdered, you know, in 2016, 2015.
[3:48:17.880 --> 3:48:23.880]  And a lot of these were from people who are agendaed by media reports on Ferguson, you know, etc.
[3:48:23.880 --> 3:48:26.880]  And they would just go out and they would shoot a cop.
[3:48:26.880 --> 3:48:35.880]  But Breitbart didn't want to touch that because it did have, you know, the FBI did talk about like the racial elements of, you know, the black, the black man getting shot by the white cop.
[3:48:35.880 --> 3:48:41.880]  And they just decided, well, there's 1% chance that this could be a backlash on us. So we're just knocking around the story.
[3:48:41.880 --> 3:48:55.880]  So yes, they have killed a lot of stories. And one thing I encourage our listeners to do is go to Lee Strainhandsthepopulous.tv for some of the stories, especially on, you know, the SPLC, the Frankfurt School, the Twin Falls narrative that Breitbart killed.
[3:48:55.880 --> 3:49:02.880]  Yeah, and I'd also heard too that there was a meeting and this is a direct quote that I got from one of my sources.
[3:49:02.880 --> 3:49:10.880]  Somebody at the meeting and said, we want to be more like the Hill. Is that anything that you heard or culturally you felt was happening?
[3:49:10.880 --> 3:49:16.880]  Yes, absolutely. And, you know, there's a time and place for that. But Breitbart's trying to be all things all people and it's not going to work.
[3:49:16.880 --> 3:49:28.880]  And, you know, they want to be, they've said publicly, we want to become the right wing version of the New York Times. Well, you're Breitbart. And I feel like they're trying to run away from the legacy and the reputation that gave them their success.
[3:49:28.880 --> 3:49:30.880]  And I think it's a mistake.
[3:49:30.880 --> 3:49:39.880]  And that's exactly why I told a lot of my friends at Breitbart, I said, you're not going to out hill the hill, you're not going to out political, political.
[3:49:39.880 --> 3:49:47.880]  So your value proposition is that you're covering news and information that nobody else in the mainstream media is going to cover.
[3:49:47.880 --> 3:49:51.880]  That's your value proposition. That's what people go to your website for. That's what they expect.
[3:49:51.880 --> 3:50:01.880]  And if all they're going to get is another saccharine basic talking point on the story of the day that they can find at the Hill of the Politico, then why go to Breitbart?
[3:50:01.880 --> 3:50:08.880]  Exactly. And becoming the right wing version of the Huffington Post, you know, that's, you're not distinguishing yourself from the herd.
[3:50:08.880 --> 3:50:16.880]  And Breitbart should be pursuing these stories, these, you know, hot button stories that maybe other legacy media will touch and ridicule them for covering too.
[3:50:16.880 --> 3:50:23.880]  We always get ridiculed for covering illegal alien crime, even though it's 100% preventable, and it's something that people care about.
[3:50:23.880 --> 3:50:28.880]  So I really hope that they return to their old legacy. They realize that, you know, the direction they're going is a mistake.
[3:50:28.880 --> 3:50:31.880]  And I just wish them all the success in the world.
[3:50:31.880 --> 3:50:45.880]  Well, I think I don't want to get my facts wrong. So correct me if I'm wrong. Didn't Ann Coulter have her column serialized at Breitbart and they cut out a link that she had included to a map of violence against Trump supporters?
[3:50:45.880 --> 3:50:58.880]  Yes. Ann's column on how leftists want to kill us, which is frighteningly true, had a link to American Renaissance, which is a white advocacy group very famous was founded on 1990.
[3:50:58.880 --> 3:51:05.880]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals? Are you happy doing laundry with detergents? Are you happy paying high prices?

[3:54:46.880 --> 3:54:51.880]  Like we don't belong. Like we're outcasts. We are the mainstream. We are the majority.
[3:54:51.880 --> 3:54:57.880]  We're taking back what is rightfully us. We're the good guys. We got to quit acting like we're in the shadows.
[3:54:57.880 --> 3:55:01.880]  Because of these liberal medias, these pedophiles threatening assassination.

[3:55:07.880 --> 3:55:11.880]  I hope that guy has health insurance. He doesn't, but I do. He's going to have to go fund me.
[3:55:11.880 --> 3:55:15.880]  They're making fun of anybody who doesn't have the kind of money that they have.
[3:55:15.880 --> 3:55:21.880]  Johnny Depp advocating the assassination of President Trump, Madonna threatening to kill Trump, Kathy Griffin.
[3:55:21.880 --> 3:55:26.880]  All these pedophiles in the media, the pedophiles in the DNC, they won't hand over their server.
[3:55:26.880 --> 3:55:30.880]  They are the pedophiles. They are the people covering things up.
[3:55:30.880 --> 3:55:34.880]  They are the murderers. They are the psychopaths. They are the reptiles.
[3:55:34.880 --> 3:55:39.880]  So it is time for us to show up in public. We're not hiding anymore.
[3:55:39.880 --> 3:55:44.880]  We're not going to let the streets belong to these vile, disgusting, wicked, duplicitous,
[3:55:44.880 --> 3:55:49.880]  demonic people. Tonight, Trump Hotel, 7 p.m. Host drone, Magam meetup.
[3:55:49.880 --> 3:55:54.880]  We're also having a protest, not a protest, a rally against political violence.
[3:55:54.880 --> 3:55:59.880]  We're going to do that in front of the White House, Washington, D.C. This Sunday at noon.
[3:55:59.880 --> 3:56:03.880]  I do believe N4 Wars will be live streaming, but I will double check that.
[3:56:03.880 --> 3:56:08.880]  And so watch the live stream if you can't make it. If you're near D.C., come on out.
[3:56:08.880 --> 3:56:12.880]  I'll be there. Jack will be there. Roger Stone will be there. Cassandra.
[3:56:12.880 --> 3:56:17.880]  A lot of great people, a lot of fellow patriots are going to be there.
[3:56:17.880 --> 3:56:24.880]  Katie McCue, what is the future of conservative media? Alex wants to do a massive expansion.
[3:56:24.880 --> 3:56:28.880]  He had told me who is on your wish list of people.
[3:56:28.880 --> 3:56:31.880]  And I had mentioned a few names. I'm not going to go, you know, over all of them,
[3:56:31.880 --> 3:56:36.880]  but I'd say that I think Katie McCue is one of like the greatest talents right now in media.
[3:56:36.880 --> 3:56:40.880]  So what is your advice for the future of right wing media, conservative media,
[3:56:40.880 --> 3:56:44.880]  whatever, populist media, nationalist media, whatever it is that we want to call it?
[3:56:44.880 --> 3:56:48.880]  I would say absolutely be happy warriors and stay engaged with your audience.
[3:56:48.880 --> 3:56:51.880]  What you and Alex are sponsoring is MAGA Meetups are so important,
[3:56:51.880 --> 3:56:56.880]  because the media does try to make you feel ashamed, alone, atomized, cut off from everyone else.
[3:56:56.880 --> 3:57:00.880]  They do not want us to practice freedom of speech. They do not want us to practice freedom of assembly.
[3:57:00.880 --> 3:57:03.880]  They want us scared and alone and separated from each other.
[3:57:03.880 --> 3:57:08.880]  So I think the future of conservative media will be bringing readers together in physical space
[3:57:08.880 --> 3:57:11.880]  to get together and form a real movement.
[3:57:11.880 --> 3:57:15.880]  So what would that look like brainstorming the idea? What would that look like?
[3:57:15.880 --> 3:57:19.880]  Well, I think these having spontaneous MAGA Meetups across the country is a great idea,
[3:57:19.880 --> 3:57:24.880]  because it all starts in the community. I think that all of us patriots should be rooted
[3:57:24.880 --> 3:57:28.880]  in leaders in our communities and be connected with each other across the country.
[3:57:28.880 --> 3:57:31.880]  So, you know, in your hometown, you can just say all Trump supporters,
[3:57:31.880 --> 3:57:34.880]  let's get coffee on this morning, you know, Sunday morning after church,
[3:57:34.880 --> 3:57:38.880]  and just, you know, keep, keep building community and keep making strong ties
[3:57:38.880 --> 3:57:40.880]  and don't let the media, you know, gaslight and to think,
[3:57:40.880 --> 3:57:44.880]  gaslight you into thinking you're alone and there's something wrong with you.
[3:57:44.880 --> 3:57:49.880]  And also we need more people doing YouTube's, Twitter, social media, even, you know,
[3:57:49.880 --> 3:57:54.880]  even if it's on knitting, we need all patriots to just kind of be out there and to unite.
[3:57:54.880 --> 3:57:57.880]  So I want to give you the last sort of 30 to 45 seconds.
[3:57:57.880 --> 3:58:02.880]  What is new in media? What is going on? What are the patriots listening need to do?
[3:58:02.880 --> 3:58:06.880]  I think that everyone should follow your model in a Jack Pestovic's model of getting on Twitter,
[3:58:06.880 --> 3:58:09.880]  getting on Facebook and doing periscopes.
[3:58:09.880 --> 3:58:15.880]  We need to get in their faces, legally and lawfully. More of that, take over.
[3:58:15.880 --> 3:58:18.880]  Thanks so much, Katie, for your time. It's a pleasure talking to you,
[3:58:18.880 --> 3:58:22.880]  and I hope to see you at one of these MAGA meetings up to one of these days.
[3:58:22.880 --> 3:58:24.880]  Thank you so much, Mike. I really appreciate it.
[3:58:24.880 --> 3:58:27.880]  My pleasure. So you just heard from Katie McHugh.
[3:58:27.880 --> 3:58:31.880]  She's a great, up-and-coming, rising star and a star on her own right
[3:58:31.880 --> 3:58:34.880]  in right wing media. Everybody, thank you so much for listening in,
[3:58:34.880 --> 3:59:03.880]  and thank you so much for your support. I will see you next Friday.
