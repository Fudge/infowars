[00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:10.593]  Wow, Friday.
[00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:13.275]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:19.958]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.519]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.002]  Hard to believe it's already Friday, the 23rd day of June, 2017, and all hell is breaking loose.
[00:00:30.902 --> 00:00:34.424]  The Democrats have lost a fourth consecutive special election.
[00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:57.718]  They consecutively broke all previous records in each one of the four failed special elections since President Trump was sworn in on January 20th, 2017, the day the power began to transfer from Washington and from globalist combines offshore back to we, the people.
[00:00:58.672 --> 00:01:03.157]  And he's been delivering in royal spades.
[00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:18.352]  And the globalists who've hijacked our country, hijacked Europe, hijacked Latin America, hijacked Africa, hijacked Eastern Europe, hijacked Russia, hijacked the Middle East, are in total, complete, absolute freak-out mode.
[00:01:19.977 --> 00:01:27.382]  They burned through 35 million on the special elections, and that was just the party, not just their PACs.
[00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:29.543]  Unbelievable.
[00:01:29.543 --> 00:01:41.031]  And so how do they respond, being spoiled brat, wannabe elitist, who are part of a cult of power, who believe that they're sitting on top of the bitter clingers, and that they control the Christians and the Patriots, and I guess they do.
[00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:42.832]  They have our children in their clutches.
[00:01:42.832 --> 00:01:44.173]  They brainwash them.
[00:01:44.173 --> 00:01:45.694]  They force-inoculate them.
[00:01:45.694 --> 00:01:49.597]  But the sleeping giant is awakening to what they're doing, so they're trying to
[00:01:50.278 --> 00:01:51.584]  Cling on to the host.
[00:01:51.584 --> 00:01:55.140]  The parasites are in a desperate, insane panic.
[00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:58.309]  Do they back off?
[00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.670]  No.
[00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.893]  Johnny Depp, a meth head, $600 million that he made in the last 20 years, lost it all.
[00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:13.016]  Looks like, again, some meth mouth guy, some kind of homeless person you see on the side of the street.
[00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:15.638]  He comes out like he's a big, tough man.
[00:02:15.638 --> 00:02:18.579]  He can hardly stand up with some other waterhead.
[00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:24.022]  And they stand up there and talk about how they dream about killing the president.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.582]  Oh, how original by another spoiled rotten piece of filth that if you don't like America, you should move to North Korea.
[00:02:31.582 --> 00:02:33.762]  In fact, Paul Watson has a video we're going to play coming up.
[00:02:33.762 --> 00:02:36.223]  The dubbest liberal ever.
[00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:38.304]  And the woman says she wants more Muslims.
[00:02:38.304 --> 00:02:39.264]  They're not a threat.
[00:02:39.264 --> 00:02:41.264]  She says white men are.
[00:02:41.264 --> 00:02:51.787]  Some addled, spoiled, pension fund, government funded, college paid for, scholarship whining idiot.
[00:02:51.787 --> 00:02:53.848]  I am going to offer this moron
[00:02:54.864 --> 00:02:57.445]  First class tickets.
[00:02:57.445 --> 00:03:06.569]  First class tickets and 20,000 pounds to move for one year to Libya or to Syria.
[00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.531]  I'm sorry, those are total war zones thanks to you people helping put the radical jihadis in.
[00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:11.591]  How about Saudi Arabia?
[00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.852]  I'm offering you 20,000 pounds.
[00:03:13.852 --> 00:03:15.053]  That's $35,000.
[00:03:15.053 --> 00:03:15.253]  $30,000.
[00:03:15.253 --> 00:03:21.856]  And I'm offering you first class one-way tickets to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, baby.
[00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:30.085]  You go there, you run your mouth, you show your face in public, they'll cane you, and next they'll kill you.
[00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:33.747]  The headline will be, Jones wishes Muslims could kill a poor woman.
[00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:34.848]  That's how they spent it in jail.
[00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:37.389]  I was like, bring in more Muslims!
[00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.931]  Or, you know, any of these globalist minions.
[00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:42.212]  And I go, hey, why don't you go move there then?
[00:03:42.212 --> 00:03:44.133]  Oh!
[00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:45.154]  Oh no, we're not going to do that!
[00:03:45.896 --> 00:03:49.197]  The media spends, I hope they go to the Middle East and get raped.
[00:03:49.197 --> 00:03:56.760]  No, I hope you don't bring that here because I've got three daughters and a son and I don't like it.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.480]  I don't want to bring North Korea here.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.522]  Hell, they're trying to transplant whole Syrian towns of invaders that came in and took over.
[00:04:04.708 --> 00:04:05.949]  into Germany right now.
[00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:07.951]  They've already brought 10 million in.
[00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:12.675]  I'm sorry, I kept seeing 5 million the last couple years and 7 million total the last 8 years.
[00:04:12.675 --> 00:04:17.519]  No, it's 10 m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
[00:04:26.658 --> 00:04:28.800]  And I'm in my InfoWars uniform today.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.067]  I'm not wearing the sports jacket and the button-up shirt, because I need to be able to get wound up proper here today.
[00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:40.611]  Oh, Tuck Buckford's wound up today, everybody.
[00:04:40.611 --> 00:04:43.774]  So get ready, because this is the InfoWar.
[00:04:43.774 --> 00:04:45.675]  We're going in through
[00:04:46.716 --> 00:04:47.858]  And beyond.
[00:04:47.858 --> 00:04:52.663]  Spread the word, spread the links, the live feeds on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, your local station.
[00:04:52.663 --> 00:04:53.504]  Spread the word.
[00:04:53.504 --> 00:04:58.571]  It's an act of resistance against the dirtbag globalists that know they're hanging on by their fingernails.
[00:05:00.268 --> 00:05:04.111]  Wow, you're going to love the latest idea out of the EU.
[00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:14.678]  Scott Keller, a German member of the European Parliament and of the Green Party, said we should transplant entire villages from Syria to Germany and that would encourage more migrants to enter Germany.
[00:05:14.678 --> 00:05:15.959]  Listen to these quotes.
[00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:23.785]  The idea of Syrian villages is only one possibility we can use, for example, if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees.
[00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:29.506]  People would rather go where compatriots already live, which makes integration and acceptance easier.
[00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:31.507]  Let's look at these three compatriots.
[00:05:31.507 --> 00:05:32.767]  From Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:33.167]  Sweden.
[00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:36.128]  Migrants viciously beat disabled men while calling him racist.
[00:05:36.128 --> 00:05:42.329]  Three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a homeless man's wallet in a train station during an incident which took place last month.
[00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:49.351]  The handicapped man was kicked and punched and received a vicious uppercut as one of the migrants lectured him about war on Muslims and how all Swedes were racist.
[00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:51.572]  Now how's that for acceptance?
[00:05:51.572 --> 00:05:54.833]  You can read both articles now on InfoWars.com.
[00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:59.315]  Roger reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:05:59.315 --> 00:06:04.738]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:07.579]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:09.420]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.566]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:06:14.566 --> 00:06:16.669]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:17.950]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.077]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:06:23.077 --> 00:06:26.441]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:06:26.581 --> 00:06:29.943]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:06:29.943 --> 00:06:32.944]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:06:32.944 --> 00:06:36.646]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:43.550]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:51.053]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[00:06:51.053 --> 00:06:53.955]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste.
[00:06:55.036 --> 00:07:13.428]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic high quality.
[00:07:13.428 --> 00:07:19.192]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out
[00:07:19.352 --> 00:07:22.556]  High quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[00:07:22.556 --> 00:07:27.201]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:34.328]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:35.490]  It's all there.
[00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.374]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it!
[00:07:39.554 --> 00:07:40.895]  It's truly game-changing.
[00:07:40.895 --> 00:07:43.918]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different.
[00:07:43.918 --> 00:07:48.843]  Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores.
[00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:51.625]  Buying it directly from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:07:51.625 --> 00:07:54.248]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.

[00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:05.603]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:05.603 --> 00:08:12.188]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:08:12.188 --> 00:08:17.633]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, the 23rd day of June 2017.
[00:08:17.633 --> 00:08:26.379]  And everybody knows, I don't put a good face on things unless really good things are happening.
[00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:28.061]  And that is happening right now.
[00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:34.540]  The air is electrical with political change across the globe, not just here but the United States.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:50.670]  We've seen four special elections with the Democrats spending more money than they've ever spent in any other elections, and they lost despite the mainstream media demonization, the dirty tricks, the illegals voting, people voting under dead people's identities.
[00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.551]  It's all been confirmed.
[00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:54.533]  5.7 million voting illegally.
[00:08:55.393 --> 00:09:12.365]  All of it confirmed now coming out in the last election but still they lost despite the fake polls, despite giving the debate questions weeks before to Hillary to try to rig it, despite having the moderators go after Trump where it'd be 3-1.
[00:09:12.365 --> 00:09:16.008]  Trump called it out and said it's 3-1 but still I'm winning.
[00:09:17.321 --> 00:09:21.306]  And it's that same attitude, ladies and gentlemen, that we've all got to have.
[00:09:21.306 --> 00:09:22.607]  Forget the Super Bowl.
[00:09:22.607 --> 00:09:24.590]  Forget NBA basketball.
[00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.816]  This is the real game of life for the future of America and the world.
[00:09:29.816 --> 00:09:31.878]  Freedom versus slavery.
[00:09:31.878 --> 00:09:33.660]  This is such an amazing time to be alive.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.163]  This is going to be a powerful transmission today.
[00:09:37.455 --> 00:09:39.436]  Just look at these headlines.
[00:09:39.436 --> 00:09:44.657]  MSNBC's Brzezinski, Trump is developing a dictatorship, must be stopped.
[00:09:44.657 --> 00:09:47.558]  MSNBC analyst compares Trump to a suicide bomber.
[00:09:47.558 --> 00:09:55.181]  And of course another MSNBC host, an analyst, called for ISIS to hit Trump properties like Trump Tower.
[00:09:55.181 --> 00:09:57.102]  So everything they say about Trump, they are.
[00:09:57.842 --> 00:10:03.224]  They're trying to overthrow the election instead of a dictatorship of the bureaucracy and the deep state.
[00:10:03.224 --> 00:10:17.848]  Connecticut campus shut as professor flees following let them effing die tweet directing students to begin killing right-wingers and Trump supporters and all bigots saying smile a bit as you kill them and as you murder them.
[00:10:19.178 --> 00:10:24.902]  More and more campuses are just totally having to shut because of mass total mental illness.
[00:10:24.902 --> 00:10:25.683]  Unbelievable.
[00:10:25.683 --> 00:10:29.506]  These are re-education camps, but they've been contained.
[00:10:29.506 --> 00:10:31.868]  They're designed to be culture bombs.
[00:10:31.868 --> 00:10:33.809]  They're designed to be social disruptor systems.
[00:10:33.809 --> 00:10:35.070]  That's all declassified.
[00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:41.435]  But if you contain them, if you contain the weapons system and it can't replicate, it degrades and implodes on itself.
[00:10:41.915 --> 00:10:44.117]  They're going through a degrade implosion right now.
[00:10:44.117 --> 00:10:47.500]  We're having devastating victories.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.601]  Devastating.
[00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:50.923]  We're devastating the enemy worldwide.
[00:10:50.923 --> 00:10:52.284]  They may set off a nuke in D.C.
[00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:54.105]  They may release a bioweapon, though.
[00:10:54.105 --> 00:10:56.087]  Soros and the Globalists are very wicked.
[00:10:56.087 --> 00:10:57.508]  Do not underestimate them.
[00:10:57.508 --> 00:11:00.911]  But even if that happens, the survivors will dig them out of their bunkers.
[00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:05.515]  We will dig you out of your bunkers, no matter where you go, Globalists, even if you release the bioweapon.
[00:11:05.515 --> 00:11:06.495]  We're fully aware of your plans.
[00:11:07.296 --> 00:11:11.159]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, the military is fully aware of your operations.
[00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:14.821]  You're all, right now, in the sights, and you know it, don't you, globalist?
[00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:18.183]  Yeah, this is a two-way street, baby, and you've now shown yourself.
[00:11:18.183 --> 00:11:20.825]  Just keep showing yourself, keep burning yourself down.
[00:11:20.825 --> 00:11:21.845]  That's all coming up.
[00:11:21.845 --> 00:11:25.308]  But let me put the cherry on top before I do this key report that Darren McBrain put together.
[00:11:26.525 --> 00:11:32.969]  Johnny Depp is a drug addict meth head that looks like a child molester you'd see on the side of the road, okay?
[00:11:32.969 --> 00:11:34.570]  I'm not saying he's a child molester.
[00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.631]  He just looks like one.
[00:11:35.631 --> 00:11:39.494]  Johnny Depp is a talentless joke trying to act cool.
[00:11:39.494 --> 00:11:44.117]  Hey, Stevie Ray Vaughan could play the guitar great and had that style in the 80s.
[00:11:44.117 --> 00:11:45.097]  He was cool.
[00:11:45.097 --> 00:11:48.760]  You look like just a joke stumbling around.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.161]  Six hundred million dollars you made.
[00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:51.422]  You lost it all.
[00:11:51.422 --> 00:11:55.064]  You've got some other old geezer liberal wannabe trendy.
[00:11:55.064 --> 00:11:56.405]  I mean, I used to not like Hollywood.
[00:11:57.065 --> 00:12:03.087]  I can't look at it, I can't listen to it, I can hardly put up with any of it anymore.
[00:12:03.087 --> 00:12:14.912]  It is just so anti-human, so elitist, so drugged out, so brainwashed, so filthy rich, while it's bitching about Trump trying to cut taxes for the middle class and trying to get jobs back for factory workers.
[00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:17.160]  It's just sick.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.983]  And I saw it this morning and couldn't find good audio of it because he's mumbling so bad.
[00:12:21.983 --> 00:12:29.547]  And then he just sits there like he's such a genius when he says he dreams of killing Trump, of assassinating Trump, like he's the greatest genius ever.
[00:12:29.547 --> 00:12:30.507]  And then you see a bunch of
[00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:42.437]  You just moronic, mind-numbed, zombie-looking twit fans, when he says it, just hold on every word like God had just said something.
[00:12:42.437 --> 00:12:49.140]  No, a meth-head, loser, joke, punk, jumped on the whole bandwagon of other
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:13:05.089]  Harpies and sea hags like Madonna and everybody else saying, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill Trump, kill his supporters, kill America, kill Christians, kill flyover country, bring in the radical Muslims, have women wear hijabs.
[00:13:05.089 --> 00:13:10.333]  We're allied with anything that hates Christendom and hates Western civilization and hates freedom.
[00:13:11.053 --> 00:13:12.294]  But here's the good news.
[00:13:12.294 --> 00:13:16.837]  All over Africa, all over Latin America, people are rejecting globalism, and they're rejecting it here.
[00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:26.082]  People want prosperity, they want freedom, they want families, they want true diversity, they want true open societies, but not bullying brainwash facilities we see everywhere.
[00:13:26.082 --> 00:13:32.667]  So Johnny Depp is such a pathetic, I'm not just saying that, you know it, just a doddering
[00:13:33.647 --> 00:13:35.728]  Drugged out with meth mouth.
[00:13:35.728 --> 00:13:36.808]  He can barely talk.
[00:13:36.808 --> 00:13:37.948]  Looked like Carrie Fisher.
[00:13:37.948 --> 00:13:38.789]  Feel sorry for her.
[00:13:38.789 --> 00:13:43.530]  You know, she was a drug addict, admittedly, but at least she wasn't a hateful person politically.
[00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:50.012]  Depp is this drugged out, shrivel-brained, looks like a child molester.
[00:13:50.012 --> 00:13:52.153]  You'd see him, again, driving around in a creeper van.
[00:13:52.913 --> 00:13:57.174]  And he's up there dreaming of, can actors kill presidents?
[00:13:57.174 --> 00:14:02.135]  Or have, oh but I'm not an actor making a little joke trying to invoke murder and death.
[00:14:02.135 --> 00:14:08.636]  Hey Johnny Depp, can somebody find out where you're at sometime and walk up and pump a bunch of bullets into your sorry ass?
[00:14:08.636 --> 00:14:10.076]  Because I don't want that to happen.
[00:14:10.076 --> 00:14:13.697]  I don't walk around in people's yards trying to find dog crap to step in.
[00:14:13.697 --> 00:14:19.258]  But you know, if dogs keep laying it down in front of us, we're going to step on some of you by accident, you jerk!
[00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:23.073]  I mean, you think you're playing games here, boy?
[00:14:23.073 --> 00:14:25.635]  You and you Hollywood scum, bunch of wannabe gangsters?
[00:14:25.635 --> 00:14:29.278]  You've taken America's kindness and openness to crap all over it!
[00:14:29.278 --> 00:14:30.919]  And that time's coming to an end!
[00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:36.463]  So to you and all the Hollywood gangsters and all of you, and I know who you are by name, you better watch your ass!
[00:14:36.463 --> 00:14:45.269]  Because we're gonna kick your ass politically, just like 1776, you keep running your mouth and starting a violent war that you're beating the drums for!
[00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:46.430]  You know what's gonna happen to you.
[00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.452]  Let's play Johnny Slimeball Depp.
[00:14:50.363 --> 00:14:51.961]  I think he needs help.
[00:14:55.578 --> 00:14:56.979]  I don't know.
[00:14:56.979 --> 00:15:00.421]  There's a lot of wonderful dark, dark places you could go.
[00:15:00.421 --> 00:15:08.065]  A lot of Doc Martens in the, uh... It's just a question.
[00:15:08.065 --> 00:15:09.746]  I'm not insinuating anything.
[00:15:09.746 --> 00:15:11.247]  By the way, this is gonna be in the press.
[00:15:11.247 --> 00:15:12.367]  It'll be horrible.
[00:15:12.367 --> 00:15:14.068]  It'll be horrible.
[00:15:14.068 --> 00:15:16.029]  I'd like, I like that you're all a part of it.
[00:15:16.029 --> 00:15:19.811]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[00:15:19.811 --> 00:15:24.294]  When was the last time somebody killed an actor for running their mouth?
[00:15:28.024 --> 00:15:30.486]  Seriously.
[00:15:30.486 --> 00:15:36.252]  Now, I want to clarify, I'm not an actor.
[00:15:36.252 --> 00:15:37.653]  I lie for a living.
[00:15:37.653 --> 00:15:40.396]  That's right you do, you piece of filth.
[00:15:40.396 --> 00:15:42.058]  Turn him off.
[00:15:42.058 --> 00:15:46.162]  Darren McBrain did an incredibly powerful piece on The Deep State that I'm going to premiere at the bottom of the hour.
[00:15:47.796 --> 00:15:59.523]  But if you look at all of this, I mean, these people are on every channel there is, beating the drum incessantly to kill Trump, kill his family, kidnap his wife, rape her.
[00:15:59.523 --> 00:16:03.546]  And Bow Wow had the sense to come out and apologize.
[00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:07.168]  And Snoop Dogg has had the decency to shut his mouth, because here's the deal.
[00:16:07.168 --> 00:16:13.932]  You got your free speech, but you keep calling for killing people, and Trump supporters are getting shot and stabbed all over the place.
[00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:14.813]  Congressman got shot.
[00:16:15.865 --> 00:16:19.408]  Was fighting for his life until just two days ago and has had a bunch of surgeries.
[00:16:19.408 --> 00:16:28.276]  And you people are so evil, you go out and demonstrate and boo and hiss when people call for his recovery.
[00:16:28.276 --> 00:16:29.357]  That's who you are.
[00:16:29.357 --> 00:16:31.679]  And you're running your mouths.
[00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:33.120]  You live in the lap of luxury.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.603]  You run around acting tough and cool all day.
[00:16:36.603 --> 00:16:38.465]  And you have no idea.
[00:16:38.465 --> 00:16:40.026]  No idea!
[00:16:40.026 --> 00:16:40.627]  No idea!
[00:16:42.059 --> 00:16:45.862]  That goes for David Brock and all the rest of these people.
[00:16:45.862 --> 00:16:51.427]  We're aware of their operations, we're aware of their productions, we're aware of all the different things they're up to.
[00:16:51.427 --> 00:17:08.982]  And now the doctors, the scientists, the engineers, the surgeons have got their scalpels and their sutures and their instruments out and they're just deciding right now over the patient how much has to get cut out.
[00:17:08.982 --> 00:17:10.383]  And can the patient even live?
[00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:20.216]  But I will assure you in that process of that delicate surgery that you're going to get everything your evil little butts ever wanted.
[00:17:21.024 --> 00:17:22.585]  And I take no pleasure in that.
[00:17:22.585 --> 00:17:25.046]  I think it's pretty clear you're going to start a civil war.
[00:17:25.046 --> 00:17:28.588]  In fact, I think it's clear we've eased into one.
[00:17:28.588 --> 00:17:32.570]  And that's how a lot of wars, a lot of civil wars start, is you never really have a demarcation line.
[00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.152]  You don't have a shot heard around the world like we had in 1775.
[00:17:36.152 --> 00:17:38.874]  You just kind of slip into the lawlessness.
[00:17:38.874 --> 00:17:41.915]  And you guys are sowing the wind.
[00:17:41.915 --> 00:17:43.476]  And you know what happens then?
[00:17:43.476 --> 00:17:47.098]  You sow the wind, you reap the whirlwind.
[00:17:48.562 --> 00:17:52.943]  And most of you can hardly talk, you can hardly walk.
[00:17:52.943 --> 00:18:03.047]  It's like I was watching this morning, I saw a clip of The Wall, the music video from Pink Floyd, and it shows the kids going into the school normal, and they come out as little zombies.
[00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:06.553]  And they're just fed into a meat grinder.
[00:18:06.553 --> 00:18:09.955]  So first they dehumanize you, then they feed you into a meat grinder.
[00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:13.917]  And that's exactly how all of this works.
[00:18:13.917 --> 00:18:16.699]  And so you're now calling it a civil war.
[00:18:16.699 --> 00:18:18.480]  You're saying you want an insurrection.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.082]  You're saying you want to hunt Trump supporters.
[00:18:21.082 --> 00:18:24.403]  You're saying you want to bomb things.
[00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:33.689]  You're saying Trump's a dictator, but you've got your elite publications calling for his overthrow and how they're going to have new elections run by Obama's old homeland security.
[00:18:34.867 --> 00:18:41.112]  And now you're gonna take our guns, and you're gonna shut the press off once and for all, and you're gonna start with Alex Jones?
[00:18:41.112 --> 00:18:42.574]  Good luck!
[00:18:42.574 --> 00:18:45.056]  Really, good luck with all of that, fools.
[00:18:45.056 --> 00:18:52.823]  The minute you try to actually shut us down completely, you take us from powerful to incredibly powerful.
[00:18:52.823 --> 00:18:55.345]  You turn us into martyrs, you take us to the next level.
[00:18:56.479 --> 00:18:59.164]  You can't win, to quote Episode 4 of Star Wars.
[00:18:59.164 --> 00:19:04.374]  You strike us down, we become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[00:19:04.374 --> 00:19:05.797]  That's history.
[00:19:05.797 --> 00:19:08.482]  That's art imitating life, not life imitating art.
[00:19:09.943 --> 00:19:11.344]  That's the truth.
[00:19:11.344 --> 00:19:19.947]  We have the upper hand as long as we're moral, as long as we're focused, as long as we have courage, and as long as we don't back down to you people, you're going to lose.
[00:19:19.947 --> 00:19:24.889]  It's not like Korea, where you set up a dictatorship where people never had freedom for thousands of years.
[00:19:24.889 --> 00:19:29.131]  And we're a hermitage-controlled vice system of China.
[00:19:30.413 --> 00:19:32.694]  Under vassal control.
[00:19:32.694 --> 00:19:40.756]  It's not like you're coming out of the Orthodox Christian and then the Czars and some of the oppressions in Russia into something even worse.
[00:19:40.756 --> 00:19:43.056]  The whole world's coming out of globalism.
[00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:45.397]  The renaissance is spreading.
[00:19:45.397 --> 00:19:48.157]  And this is only the birth pains of that.
[00:19:48.157 --> 00:19:56.139]  But that renaissance is humanity getting its feet on the ground before we face the AI and the Antichrist.
[00:19:56.139 --> 00:19:58.340]  So all this stuff you see is just testing.
[00:19:59.622 --> 00:20:04.103]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[00:20:04.103 --> 00:20:12.066]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[00:20:12.066 --> 00:20:15.087]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[00:20:15.087 --> 00:20:19.068]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[00:20:19.068 --> 00:20:21.749]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[00:20:21.749 --> 00:20:25.430]  It's by using the amazing Home Freeze Dryer from Harvest Right.
[00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:30.092]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[00:20:30.092 --> 00:20:35.314]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[00:20:35.314 --> 00:20:41.156]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting food on hand.
[00:20:41.156 --> 00:20:43.957]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[00:20:44.477 --> 00:20:46.220]  We love our freeze dryer.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.464]  To learn more, go to harvestright.com or call 800-923-9591.
[00:20:48.464 --> 00:20:49.325]  That's harvestright.com or 800-923-9591.
[00:20:58.703 --> 00:20:59.524]  Embrics Essentials.
[00:20:59.524 --> 00:21:00.644]  That's my middle name.
[00:21:00.644 --> 00:21:13.033]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic, high quality.
[00:21:13.033 --> 00:21:18.057]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country.
[00:21:18.257 --> 00:21:22.141]  That puts out high-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[00:21:22.141 --> 00:21:26.746]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[00:21:26.746 --> 00:21:33.854]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto ship, an additional 25% off.
[00:21:33.854 --> 00:21:35.015]  It's all there.
[00:21:35.015 --> 00:21:35.696]  The Body Wash.
[00:21:35.956 --> 00:21:40.401]  The shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[00:21:40.401 --> 00:21:51.112]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:51.112 --> 00:21:53.695]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[00:21:53.695 --> 00:21:57.760]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emrix Essentials.
[00:21:58.243 --> 00:22:03.367]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:22:03.367 --> 00:22:09.071]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:14.255]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[00:22:14.255 --> 00:22:16.216]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[00:22:16.216 --> 00:22:18.598]  Holistic treatment may be eligible for sharing.
[00:22:18.598 --> 00:22:19.539]  See guidelines.
[00:22:19.539 --> 00:22:22.821]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[00:22:22.821 --> 00:22:24.783]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:22:24.783 --> 00:22:26.624]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:22:28.095 --> 00:22:29.977]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[00:22:29.977 --> 00:22:33.201]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center cut, presidential bacon.
[00:22:33.201 --> 00:22:34.803]  Savory and delicious.
[00:22:34.803 --> 00:22:37.646]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:22:37.646 --> 00:22:38.307]  Awesome.
[00:22:38.307 --> 00:22:41.391]  No refrigeration needed with a 10 year shelf life.
[00:22:41.391 --> 00:22:42.972]  NASA PAC Technology.

[00:22:57.916 --> 00:23:02.377]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[00:23:02.377 --> 00:23:03.978]  Those times may be near.
[00:23:03.978 --> 00:23:04.518]  Think about it.
[00:23:04.878 --> 00:23:09.481]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[00:23:09.481 --> 00:23:14.483]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[00:23:14.483 --> 00:23:20.287]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[00:23:20.287 --> 00:23:26.990]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.552]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:32.793]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[00:24:05.996 --> 00:24:14.182]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:24:14.182 --> 00:24:26.530]  I'm going to get into the big deep state news, more on Johnny Depp, what's happening in the economy, the Democrats going into full panic mode in the next segment.
[00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:30.833]  But right now, look at the type of articles they're just handing me in real time.
[00:24:30.833 --> 00:24:32.094]  This is out of Medusa magazine.
[00:24:33.086 --> 00:24:35.468]  Which is a feminist magazine.
[00:24:35.468 --> 00:24:37.750]  That's not a joke.
[00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:42.053]  Beyond pro-choice, the solution to white supremacy is white abortion.
[00:24:42.053 --> 00:24:46.097]  And it says, if you get pregnant with a white man, abort it and adopt a black baby.
[00:24:46.097 --> 00:24:47.818]  Whites are inherently evil.
[00:24:47.818 --> 00:24:49.499]  People think, oh, this is just some French thing.
[00:24:49.499 --> 00:24:54.644]  This is taught at every major college in America.
[00:24:54.644 --> 00:24:57.526]  This is the operating system.
[00:24:57.526 --> 00:25:00.709]  By white professors, mainly.
[00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:07.211]  And then you get a professor like Weinstein at Evergreen, who's a biology professor, and says, look, I'm a big liberal.
[00:25:07.211 --> 00:25:12.033]  But you can't ban whites, you know, from the school for a day.
[00:25:12.033 --> 00:25:14.553]  If you want to walk off campus, that's one thing.
[00:25:14.553 --> 00:25:15.633]  That's racism.
[00:25:15.633 --> 00:25:17.574]  And now they want him basically dead.
[00:25:17.574 --> 00:25:18.714]  The college is shut down.
[00:25:18.714 --> 00:25:22.335]  And Joe Rogan says, why is the left attacking itself?
[00:25:22.335 --> 00:25:24.416]  Because it's a weapons system.
[00:25:24.416 --> 00:25:25.736]  We have all the white papers.
[00:25:25.736 --> 00:25:27.676]  We have all the documents.
[00:25:27.676 --> 00:25:29.637]  We've gone over them ad nauseam here.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.002]  This is a planned program.
[00:25:34.002 --> 00:25:35.343]  It's working.
[00:25:35.343 --> 00:25:36.204]  It's standardized.
[00:25:36.204 --> 00:25:37.564]  It's not just at Evergreen.
[00:25:37.564 --> 00:25:38.085]  It's everywhere.
[00:25:38.085 --> 00:25:38.705]  And then this.
[00:25:38.705 --> 00:25:39.726]  News roundup.
[00:25:39.726 --> 00:25:47.791]  Obama says Senate health care bill has meanness at its core, even though it's got too much spending and too much largesse and will bankrupt us.
[00:25:47.791 --> 00:25:49.052]  It's not as bad as Obamacare.
[00:25:52.451 --> 00:25:59.434]  We are being driven towards collapse by design because the globalists are tax-exempt offshore and want to consolidate.
[00:25:59.434 --> 00:26:00.414]  That's their system!
[00:26:00.414 --> 00:26:03.936]  It gets worse.
[00:26:03.936 --> 00:26:13.539]  The Lion of London Bridge, the hero that fought off the three men that had already stabbed to death a bunch of people, he decided to fight one man.
[00:26:13.539 --> 00:26:17.661]  They stabbed him, what was it, 14 times in the neck all over.
[00:26:19.175 --> 00:26:20.475]  He said, F you.
[00:26:20.475 --> 00:26:21.096]  This is London.
[00:26:21.096 --> 00:26:24.077]  I guess there's one man left.
[00:26:24.077 --> 00:26:28.498]  He is homeless while migrants secure luxury housing.
[00:26:28.498 --> 00:26:33.980]  That's right, the Muslims, the new thing is to burn down their government-issued high-rises.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.341]  Like four or five of them are burned down.
[00:26:35.341 --> 00:26:36.801]  And then the left was waiting.
[00:26:36.801 --> 00:26:39.382]  Then they go and they are reckoning.
[00:26:39.382 --> 00:26:40.622]  They are basically stealing.
[00:26:40.622 --> 00:26:41.663]  They are grabbing.
[00:26:41.663 --> 00:26:42.063]  They are
[00:26:43.342 --> 00:26:48.005]  Taking control of, confiscating, people's private homes.
[00:26:48.005 --> 00:26:50.747]  Saying, oh, you have two houses, so you don't need this flat.
[00:26:50.747 --> 00:26:55.490]  We're going to put migrants in it, just like they've done in Germany, just like they've done in Italy.
[00:26:55.490 --> 00:27:02.634]  We have the videos of a little inn owner, 80-something years old, with 20 rooms on the sea in Italy.
[00:27:02.634 --> 00:27:06.237]  And they go, here's the African migrants that just landed.
[00:27:06.237 --> 00:27:07.978]  He kicks the guy's guest out.
[00:27:07.978 --> 00:27:08.858]  He's crying.
[00:27:08.858 --> 00:27:10.279]  They go, you're not going to be compensated.
[00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:11.060]  They live here now.
[00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:18.029]  It's about seeing how much they can rub your nose in it.
[00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:21.131]  Polish MP schools BBC host on refugees.
[00:27:21.131 --> 00:27:23.092]  How many terror attacks have you had in London?
[00:27:23.092 --> 00:27:24.313]  Hundreds and hundreds.
[00:27:24.313 --> 00:27:25.954]  They've had none in Poland.
[00:27:25.954 --> 00:27:33.600]  That's all coming up and I'm going to play this powerful piece that deals with how they're trying to start a civil war and how we're already entered one.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.501]  Mark your calendars.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.061]  With Congressman Scalise getting shot a week and a half ago.
[00:27:39.061 --> 00:27:40.321]  What date was that, please, folks?
[00:27:40.321 --> 00:27:41.121]  Look that up for me.
[00:27:41.121 --> 00:27:43.562]  Because I was really thinking about this this morning and last night.
[00:27:43.562 --> 00:28:00.246]  That's when the Civil War went from a cold Civil War, a culture war, a bullying war, a leftist temper tantrum, stabbing, shooting, killing, burning a few people, to targeting Congress, and then the media, Wolf Blitzer and others, and Democrat
[00:28:01.274 --> 00:28:06.116]  All I'm going to say is what Colonel Jackson said, don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes.
[00:28:30.916 --> 00:28:34.480]  Quite frankly, we can just hold and keep letting them kill us.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.281]  I'm sorry for those who get killed.
[00:28:36.281 --> 00:28:38.283]  And don't respond offensively.
[00:28:38.283 --> 00:28:39.925]  We're winning the info war with us right now.
[00:28:39.925 --> 00:28:43.208]  In fact, if I was a globalist, I would have already staged some false flags.
[00:28:43.208 --> 00:28:47.573]  They just know law enforcement and others are pretty much on our side and are watching every move.
[00:28:47.573 --> 00:28:49.535]  So it's hard for the globalists to run false flags now.
[00:28:51.966 --> 00:28:56.128]  So as Kelis was shot June 14th, I'd say that's the shot heard around the world.
[00:28:56.128 --> 00:29:07.092]  I mean, you could argue we were already in a civil war before that, and they're calling for violence and killing the president, his family, and every major publication, and for overthrowing the government, and arresting me, and we're all Russian agents.
[00:29:07.092 --> 00:29:12.234]  Anybody that stands up for America... Russian agents.
[00:29:12.234 --> 00:29:12.895]  Yeah, right.
[00:29:12.895 --> 00:29:15.356]  They're the globalist agents and they know it.
[00:29:15.356 --> 00:29:15.776]  But June 14th,
[00:29:18.496 --> 00:29:22.419]  Nebraska Democratic official ousted for allegedly wishing Steve Kalish to die.
[00:29:22.419 --> 00:29:23.459]  USA Today.
[00:29:23.459 --> 00:29:24.520]  They are fawning.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.781]  They are frothing.
[00:29:25.781 --> 00:29:27.262]  They are foaming.
[00:29:27.262 --> 00:29:32.685]  Trump two days ago said, Congressman Kalish, our prayers go to him and the police officers and others that were shot.
[00:29:32.685 --> 00:29:33.486]  Boo!
[00:29:33.486 --> 00:29:34.647]  No!
[00:29:34.647 --> 00:29:36.208]  We'll be dying!
[00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:39.310]  I'll tell you, it's sick.
[00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:46.715]  We're gonna be right back with this incredibly powerful piece that Darren McBreen has put together.
[00:29:46.715 --> 00:29:47.816]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:47.816 --> 00:29:48.677]  Please stay with us.
[00:29:48.677 --> 00:29:50.078]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.078 --> 00:29:52.600]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.283]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:05.442]  Donald Trump just held a rally in Iowa, and one of the people in attendance, our anonymous sources say, was Bill Clinton.
[00:30:05.442 --> 00:30:06.783]  Well, how do we know it was Bill Clinton?
[00:30:06.783 --> 00:30:17.047]  Because while Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise and the other three Americans who were shot at the ball field by a deranged Bernie supporter, Democratic operatives began blowing their Bill Clinton rape whistles.
[00:30:17.047 --> 00:30:22.570]  I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend.
[00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:27.632]  Somebody that I've gotten to know very well, Steve Scalise.
[00:30:27.632 --> 00:30:27.853]  Right?
[00:30:27.853 --> 00:30:33.896]  Because that's the only reason you would try to interrupt the president as he was sending out his thoughts and prayers to somebody who had recently been shot, right?
[00:30:33.896 --> 00:30:34.897]  Come on, work with me here.
[00:30:34.897 --> 00:30:37.078]  The Democrats can't even protest right.
[00:30:37.078 --> 00:30:38.299]  These people fail at everything.
[00:30:38.299 --> 00:30:42.621]  They lose elections, they lose public support, and now they look like thoughtless cowards.
[00:30:42.621 --> 00:30:43.602]  It's just as Trump said.
[00:30:43.602 --> 00:30:46.804]  Never fails.
[00:30:46.804 --> 00:30:47.204]  Never fails.
[00:30:47.833 --> 00:30:49.674]  You can check out the video on InfoWars.com.
[00:30:49.674 --> 00:30:53.595]  Protesters blow whistles as Trump sends thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise.
[00:30:53.595 --> 00:30:55.196]  And that part about Bill Clinton being in the audience?
[00:30:55.196 --> 00:30:56.457]  That was fake news.
[00:30:56.457 --> 00:30:59.298]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:30:59.298 --> 00:31:01.179]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:01.179 --> 00:31:03.200]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.600]  It's the air we're breathing.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.101]  Especially for our children.
[00:31:06.101 --> 00:31:07.982]  The artificial particulates.
[00:31:07.982 --> 00:31:08.662]  The chemicals.
[00:31:08.882 --> 00:31:12.164]  The elite is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:12.164 --> 00:31:21.350]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:28.896]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:28.896 --> 00:31:36.921]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:36.921 --> 00:31:37.882]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:39.094 --> 00:31:43.035]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:43.035 --> 00:31:46.596]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:46.596 --> 00:31:53.318]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:53.318 --> 00:31:56.759]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4austore.com.

[00:32:56.282 --> 00:33:02.766]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:02.766 --> 00:33:05.727]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[00:33:05.727 --> 00:33:07.888]  Because it leads to the future.
[00:33:07.888 --> 00:33:11.330]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.571]  This is not a new world.
[00:33:13.571 --> 00:33:16.873]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[00:33:17.984 --> 00:33:26.387]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[00:33:26.387 --> 00:33:34.470]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:40.192]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[00:33:40.192 --> 00:33:42.413]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[00:33:47.788 --> 00:33:49.629]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[00:33:49.629 --> 00:33:57.174]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[00:33:57.174 --> 00:34:01.937]  Because he's built out of flesh, and because he has a mind.
[00:34:01.937 --> 00:34:06.600]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[00:34:11.804 --> 00:34:19.871]  The twilight zone that is authoritarianism, the wicked altar that so many have worshipped throughout history and always behaves the same and always acts the same.
[00:34:19.871 --> 00:34:22.994]  It's not based on creativity or open society and freedom.
[00:34:22.994 --> 00:34:25.756]  It's based on tyranny and oppression and death.
[00:34:25.756 --> 00:34:34.063]  And now that very system is here masquerading as liberalism, masquerading as the arts, masquerading when it's a weapons system.
[00:34:34.063 --> 00:34:35.425]  Johnny Depp from Kentucky.
[00:34:36.567 --> 00:34:48.732]  Posing like he's British in every major movie he's in, with a fake accent, in England, running down our president, and hoping he dies.
[00:34:48.732 --> 00:34:58.996]  And if somebody kills Johnny Depp, which I hope doesn't happen, or one of these other Hollywood turds, the media won't ever point out that they called for violence.
[00:34:58.996 --> 00:34:59.776]  Or Wolf Blitzer!
[00:35:00.922 --> 00:35:03.023]  Has a guest on, says, oh, I knew the guy that did this.
[00:35:03.023 --> 00:35:03.684]  He wasn't evil.
[00:35:03.684 --> 00:35:05.385]  He was just upset about politics.
[00:35:05.385 --> 00:35:06.525]  He was a nice guy.
[00:35:06.525 --> 00:35:12.069]  Well, Blitzer took it like it was a statement he agreed with.
[00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:15.091]  Cut to his panel.
[00:35:15.091 --> 00:35:17.472]  And all over the news.
[00:35:17.472 --> 00:35:20.994]  To the Washington Post, the New York Times, to the Huffington Post.
[00:35:20.994 --> 00:35:24.536]  They're out there hoping the president dies and saying, you know, too bad.
[00:35:24.536 --> 00:35:27.138]  This is so uncoordinated.
[00:35:27.138 --> 00:35:30.340]  And he didn't know how to use the firearm properly.
[00:35:31.889 --> 00:35:37.311]  Too bad he can only, you know, shoot two cops and almost kill them and almost kill the congressman and almost kill another person.
[00:35:37.311 --> 00:35:40.091]  You know, too bad.
[00:35:40.091 --> 00:35:42.012]  Johnny Depp.
[00:35:42.012 --> 00:35:44.853]  What a drugged out, fried brain idiot.
[00:35:50.285 --> 00:35:59.634]  Let's run that clip one more time of somebody that wants to run his mouth and just because the words gone out, call for violence, call for violence, start the civil war, start the civil war.
[00:35:59.634 --> 00:36:04.959]  If there's a real hot civil war, which we're sliding into, bro, we're already in one, we're sliding down.
[00:36:04.959 --> 00:36:11.886]  I will assure you you're going to be held responsible and your publicist and others that have pushed you to do this.
[00:36:13.544 --> 00:36:21.990]  You're trying to organize massive bloodshed and killing and crimes and you're using your platform to do it and you will be held accountable.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:37.188]  I love how I cover the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, when there's all these Podesta emails about wiener and child porn, you know, wiener, and trying to procure young girls, teenagers.
[00:36:37.188 --> 00:36:38.449]  We break that.
[00:36:38.449 --> 00:36:40.430]  Eric Prince breaks it.
[00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:41.431]  Breitbart breaks it.
[00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:42.752]  All the same 24 hours.
[00:36:42.752 --> 00:36:44.093]  We get no credit.
[00:36:44.093 --> 00:36:50.397]  Then the media focuses on a pizza place that does have Podesta and others going to it.
[00:36:52.415 --> 00:36:59.457]  They make it all about the pizza place, the code words, the FBI, cheese pizza, child porn, that's used worldwide.
[00:36:59.457 --> 00:37:01.958]  They focus on that as a honeypot, as a decoy.
[00:37:01.958 --> 00:37:12.721]  And then the news says, oh Jones, he made a guy that had been his listener.
[00:37:12.721 --> 00:37:14.641]  Go in there and do it.
[00:37:14.641 --> 00:37:16.442]  Alex told him to go be violent, which I never said.
[00:37:17.503 --> 00:37:26.188]  But see, I'm guilty of some guy going and supposedly shooting a hole in the roof that witnesses that were there, that I interviewed, said they didn't hear a gunshot, they didn't see it happen.
[00:37:26.188 --> 00:37:26.848]  But the D.C.
[00:37:26.848 --> 00:37:33.032]  police, the same ones that, you know, let crowds of folks attack Trump supporters at the inauguration, and the D.C.
[00:37:33.032 --> 00:37:38.895]  police involved in all the stuff we've seen, they say it happened.
[00:37:38.895 --> 00:37:43.878]  And then a guy who was an actor on an already felony plea deal in another state,
[00:37:45.305 --> 00:37:49.948]  Comes and this happens at the pizza place and it's all my fault.
[00:37:49.948 --> 00:37:57.854]  Almost a month after I said drop the story, it's a decoy, before the press ever targeted me and ever said I was the author of it.
[00:37:57.854 --> 00:38:03.218]  But I figured out they were going to do it and that what was being reported by the press wasn't accurate.
[00:38:03.218 --> 00:38:06.780]  We pulled back on it so we become the authors of it.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.201]  We become who's behind it.
[00:38:08.201 --> 00:38:13.405]  We become the devil that wants violence when we're the ones saying never be violent offensively.
[00:38:14.284 --> 00:38:17.565]  Treat the Second Amendment with great respect, as you do the first.
[00:38:17.565 --> 00:38:20.346]  We're not the ones running around saying, kill everybody.
[00:38:20.346 --> 00:38:24.147]  We're not the ones saying, bomb Trump Tower, like MSNBC is.
[00:38:24.147 --> 00:38:27.328]  We're not the ones saying, he's a suicide bomber, at the same time.
[00:38:27.328 --> 00:38:29.528]  We're not the ones saying, Trump's a dictator.
[00:38:29.528 --> 00:38:33.209]  We're not the ones saying, kill, kill, kill, kill this person, kill that person.
[00:38:33.209 --> 00:38:41.632]  But what's Johnny Depp gonna do, if somebody who isn't an actor like him, somebody who doesn't just talk, kills him?
[00:38:43.404 --> 00:38:46.945]  They're going to turn it into how the horrible right wing did this and that.
[00:38:46.945 --> 00:38:57.869]  They're eliciting their fans getting killed, their minions, their zombies, that they're out there on these huge platforms saying, do the right thing, go kill Trump or kill his supporters.
[00:38:57.869 --> 00:39:00.570]  Hey white boy, get ready to be shanked.
[00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:02.110]  You're wearing a Trump hat.
[00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:05.312]  It's political intimidation and it's not working for them.
[00:39:05.312 --> 00:39:06.392]  So what are they going to do next?
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.863]  They're going to get more hysterical, and they're going to push more and more.
[00:39:11.863 --> 00:39:19.270]  And almost all of them, like Mika Brzezinski and everybody, have never gotten their feet wet.
[00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.471]  They've never gotten their hands dirty.
[00:39:20.471 --> 00:39:24.275]  Now, Scarborough, a little bit different there.
[00:39:24.275 --> 00:39:26.317]  He's got his little hands dirty a couple times.
[00:39:26.317 --> 00:39:28.019]  Look at the little boy right there.
[00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:28.739]  Little pumpkin head.
[00:39:29.735 --> 00:39:30.675]  It's like Mars attacks.
[00:39:30.675 --> 00:39:33.396]  You know, aliens wearing a wig because the head's really so big.
[00:39:33.396 --> 00:39:35.236]  It's really a gray alien from Mars.
[00:39:35.236 --> 00:39:36.917]  I think Scarborough might be one of them.
[00:39:36.917 --> 00:39:37.817]  I'm joking!
[00:39:37.817 --> 00:39:39.597]  But he does have like a Martian head.
[00:39:39.597 --> 00:39:41.798]  I mean, could God imagine if he shaved that thing?
[00:39:41.798 --> 00:39:45.259]  He's got a Martian head.
[00:39:45.259 --> 00:39:50.180]  But getting back to the famous mass murderer's daughter, Brzezinski,
[00:39:51.576 --> 00:39:57.719]  She's saying, Amika is saying, that he's developing a dictatorship.
[00:39:57.719 --> 00:40:01.941]  No, we're removing the face-sucking cancer.
[00:40:01.941 --> 00:40:03.002]  We're removing you.
[00:40:03.002 --> 00:40:20.451]  So you sit there in your ivory tower with all your billions of dollars Daddy got, and you sit up there just imagining you're in some existential war with the horrible coal miners, and the horrible ranchers, and the horrible policemen, and the horrible air traffic controllers, and the horrible mechanics, and the horrible soldiers.
[00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:35.179]  Can you just imagine how you're the hyper elite, you're the intellectual, you go to the white tie and black tie events, you perch up on top of us, and you're gonna teach us culture, and you're gonna make our children grow up the way you want our kids to grow up, you're gonna run our lives.
[00:40:35.179 --> 00:40:39.882]  Let me tell you something, just like Starbucks called for the Islamic invaders to all be given jobs,
[00:40:41.468 --> 00:40:41.688]  I think?
[00:41:06.906 --> 00:41:08.107]  Boycott ever launched.
[00:41:08.107 --> 00:41:09.707]  Everyone's just said, you know what?
[00:41:09.707 --> 00:41:12.489]  I'm gonna go out of my way not to drink Starbucks.
[00:41:12.489 --> 00:41:19.653]  I'm gonna ask at a hotel, and if the coffee is Starbucks, I'm not gonna drink it at breakfast.
[00:41:19.653 --> 00:41:20.453]  I will not.
[00:41:20.453 --> 00:41:25.115]  I go to hotels now, and if they've got Starbucks, I don't even have coffee.
[00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:29.498]  Or I'm asking now, when I book a hotel, do you have Starbucks?
[00:41:29.498 --> 00:41:33.200]  And most of them do, and I go, I'm not booking with your hotel.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.741]  Click, and you know that gets put in the computer.
[00:41:37.134 --> 00:41:38.215]  It's war.
[00:41:38.215 --> 00:41:40.537]  They need us, not the other way around.
[00:41:40.537 --> 00:41:41.678]  They hate you.
[00:41:41.678 --> 00:41:43.120]  They hate your family.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.262]  You understand that?
[00:41:46.262 --> 00:41:48.284]  And of course the CEO had to step down.
[00:41:48.284 --> 00:41:49.265]  That's an example.
[00:41:49.265 --> 00:41:50.806]  They always want to boycott us.
[00:41:50.806 --> 00:41:52.148]  They always want to bully us.
[00:41:52.148 --> 00:41:53.128]  They always want to get in our face.
[00:41:53.128 --> 00:41:53.168]  No.
[00:41:55.285 --> 00:41:55.725]  We're done.
[00:41:55.725 --> 00:42:21.209]  Now before I play this powerful report, this boil-down by Darren McBrain that we're also going to post on InfoWars.com, I want to ask folks listening on AM and FM stations, and people watching us on cable systems around the country, and folks watching on the streams at InfoWars.com forward slash show, and folks watching us at PrisonPlanet.tv, the members of that that help pay it forward for everybody else, and they get all the documentary films and the rest of it, and people watching on Facebook and YouTube and on Twitter,
[00:42:22.432 --> 00:42:23.412]  On Periscope.
[00:42:23.412 --> 00:42:24.973]  Share that link.
[00:42:24.973 --> 00:42:27.673]  Retweet that link.
[00:42:27.673 --> 00:42:29.574]  Tweet it at Globalist.
[00:42:29.574 --> 00:42:30.754]  Tweet it at Hillary.
[00:42:30.754 --> 00:42:32.335]  Tweet it at the UN.
[00:42:32.335 --> 00:42:33.695]  Tweet it at them.
[00:42:33.695 --> 00:42:34.875]  Fight their algorithms.
[00:42:34.875 --> 00:42:36.376]  Fight their propaganda.
[00:42:36.376 --> 00:42:40.597]  Human, human action will rip their arms out of their political sockets.
[00:42:40.597 --> 00:42:41.517]  Crush them.
[00:42:41.517 --> 00:42:43.717]  Roll over them.
[00:42:43.717 --> 00:42:49.699]  When you're sitting there at lunch, or you're sitting there at night, doesn't matter when you do it, during a rebroadcast, when I'm live, when you're watching on YouTube later,
[00:42:50.643 --> 00:42:51.625]  Send out the articles.
[00:42:51.625 --> 00:42:52.367]  Send out the videos.
[00:42:52.367 --> 00:42:54.431]  Send out the videos you think are the most important.
[00:42:54.431 --> 00:42:57.677]  Send out the articles you think are the most informative.
[00:42:57.677 --> 00:42:58.960]  It's an info war.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:59.721]  You are the power.
[00:43:00.848 --> 00:43:01.669]  Come together.
[00:43:01.669 --> 00:43:03.390]  Realize the globalists are desperate.
[00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:04.070]  They're losing.
[00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:05.031]  They know it.
[00:43:05.031 --> 00:43:07.512]  We're already gone into the beginnings of a civil war.
[00:43:07.512 --> 00:43:08.973]  We're trying to right the ship.
[00:43:08.973 --> 00:43:10.254]  We don't want it to get physical.
[00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:17.179]  But now is the time to intensify information warfare operations using our secret weapon, the truth, more than ever.
[00:43:17.179 --> 00:43:22.502]  So I salute you and I thank you for your support, but you're supporting yourself here.
[00:43:22.502 --> 00:43:26.144]  So copy the link to Periscope, to Facebook Live, to YouTube.
[00:43:27.168 --> 00:43:31.591]  To Infowars.com forward slash show, however you're watching now, spread it!
[00:43:31.591 --> 00:43:35.114]  Physically call friends and family, neighbors, physically!
[00:43:35.114 --> 00:43:38.316]  Put Infowars stickers on your car or others.
[00:43:38.316 --> 00:43:40.357]  You know, you can put it at their business or wherever.
[00:43:40.357 --> 00:43:41.879]  Get aggressive!
[00:43:41.879 --> 00:43:43.700]  Realize we're turning the tide.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:49.924]  But they want to bully us into submission, so everybody shuts up about their views and rolls over to this authoritarian takeover.
[00:43:49.924 --> 00:43:52.366]  This is not the time to be bullied.
[00:43:52.366 --> 00:43:54.848]  This is the time to redouble because they're trying to bully.
[00:43:55.848 --> 00:43:59.369]  And the good news is they're losing and they're failing.
[00:43:59.369 --> 00:44:00.549]  And it's good to be able to say that.
[00:44:00.549 --> 00:44:04.870]  And it's because so many of you over the decades worked so hard to get the word out.
[00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:10.171]  Now briefly before I go to this video, 4th of July Summer Mega Special is running.

[00:45:09.676 --> 00:45:12.018]  My free speech doesn't end when you're offended.
[00:45:12.018 --> 00:45:13.719]  This is my favorite shirt.

[00:45:18.956 --> 00:45:24.578]  If you go to liberal areas, you won't get attacked as much by the anti-free speech people wearing an InfoWars shirt as a Trump shirt.
[00:45:24.578 --> 00:45:30.440]  It depends on how offensive you want to be in their face exercising the First Amendment, but you also fund the operation.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:34.202]  So get the free speech shirt today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:34.202 --> 00:45:40.644]  Now let's go ahead and go to this incredibly important report dealing with the deep state and how to combat it by Darren McBrain.
[00:45:42.256 --> 00:45:49.940]  Criminal elements inside the government, the deep state, are working with the media with fake news and fake leaks to try to undermine Trump's recovery.
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.201]  That's really the big news.
[00:45:54.933 --> 00:46:07.016]  A soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office.
[00:46:07.016 --> 00:46:13.117]  Sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear and present danger.
[00:46:13.117 --> 00:46:17.778]  When you see leaders on the left calling for essentially rising up
[00:46:18.778 --> 00:46:19.479]  A gunman opened fire.
[00:46:40.322 --> 00:46:50.744]  When members of Congress and their staffs... In the hours after five people were shot, including the House Majority Whip, you sent out a tweet that said, hunt Republicans.
[00:46:50.744 --> 00:46:56.285]  I mean, it was clearly a reference to the assassination attempt against Congressman Scalise.
[00:46:56.285 --> 00:46:59.846]  It's hard to imagine how you could justify writing something like that.
[00:46:59.846 --> 00:47:06.327]  For too long, Republicans in this country have failed to distinguish the differences between politics and war.
[00:47:06.887 --> 00:47:09.828]  And a lot of Democrats have failed to see the similarities.
[00:47:09.828 --> 00:47:13.289]  So you guys either have to tone down the rhetoric or we have to step up.
[00:47:13.289 --> 00:47:25.971]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have so much proof of the Democrats saying overthrow Trump, use COG, killing, kill his supporters, cancel the last election, remove the Republicans that were elected in the last 2016 election.
[00:47:25.971 --> 00:47:28.712]  I mean, I've got the mainstream articles here where they're pushing
[00:47:29.092 --> 00:47:35.275]  Here in America, we're at a turning point tonight with forces now forming an alliance to try and remove President Trump from office.
[00:47:35.275 --> 00:47:36.136]  It's that serious.
[00:47:36.136 --> 00:47:39.197]  The left-wing media is out to get him.
[00:47:39.197 --> 00:47:42.299]  They are out to nullify an election for the first time.
[00:47:42.299 --> 00:47:49.282]  America is now suffering from a massive informational crisis because I call them the destroy Trump media.
[00:47:50.003 --> 00:47:51.005]  Sean Hannity.
[00:48:01.198 --> 00:48:10.440]  He is currently the main leader of the resistance against the globalists outside of Trump, and then of course myself.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:15.441]  But I am more grassroots, and I'm more frontline, being demonized, being attacked.
[00:48:15.441 --> 00:48:22.243]  It's my job to get the intel out, to take the main attack, to draw the enemy fire, so that we understand exactly what we're dealing with.
[00:48:22.543 --> 00:48:26.804]  You've got the destroy Trump media that has been lying to you now.
[00:48:26.804 --> 00:48:29.745]  Provable lies for 11 months, non-stop.
[00:48:29.745 --> 00:48:31.806]  Trump-Russia collusion.
[00:48:31.806 --> 00:48:33.786]  No evidence whatsoever.
[00:48:33.786 --> 00:48:41.528]  The Russians, in my opinion, could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided.
[00:48:41.528 --> 00:48:46.330]  And they began to have some of their allies within the
[00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:51.613]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Rupley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[00:49:08.202 --> 00:49:10.884]  Infowars comes to mind where those are echo chambers.
[00:49:10.884 --> 00:49:32.939]  The way that the left is going about trying to demonize the president, essentially justify and ignore the violence on their side, and then reinforce that with a complete, the imagery of death being acceptable, Kathy Griffith using the beheaded image of the president.
[00:49:32.939 --> 00:49:36.561]  All these things are the same way ISIS goes about radically
[00:49:36.721 --> 00:49:40.445]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[00:49:49.952 --> 00:49:53.155]  It's a sad day when you cannot depend on the president's word.
[00:49:53.155 --> 00:49:56.558]  And my advice would just be to Republicans who do cozy up to him.
[00:49:56.558 --> 00:49:58.320]  It's just like hugging a suicide bomber.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.581]  He's not a tough guy.
[00:49:59.581 --> 00:50:01.022]  He's a bully and he's a bitch.
[00:50:01.022 --> 00:50:02.703]  He's a punk.
[00:50:02.703 --> 00:50:04.245]  He's a dog.
[00:50:04.245 --> 00:50:05.246]  He's a pig.
[00:50:05.246 --> 00:50:06.127]  And he can suck my f***.
[00:50:06.867 --> 00:50:09.528]  He's a con, a bullshit artist, a mutt.
[00:50:09.528 --> 00:50:12.328]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[00:50:12.328 --> 00:50:15.249]  There are a bunch of scum that just hate America.
[00:50:15.249 --> 00:50:20.490]  They're all a bunch of mentally ill nobodies.
[00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:25.231]  There are a bunch of betas that want war.
[00:50:38.231 --> 00:50:42.867]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:51.531]  It's an actor dressed to look just like President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
[00:50:51.531 --> 00:51:00.393]  Pictures and video depicting comedian Kathy Griffin holding the bloody decapitated head of President Trump are no joking matter for the Secret Service.
[00:51:00.393 --> 00:51:06.595]  The rhetoric that has inspired the violence has come from the mainstream of the Democratic Party.
[00:51:06.595 --> 00:51:11.796]  They're involved in the coup, an active attempt to start a bloody civil war.
[00:51:32.957 --> 00:51:33.677]  Powerful piece.
[00:51:33.677 --> 00:51:39.280]  I don't know what we're going to title that, but we should post it on Facebook and YouTube right now, and everybody should get it out there.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:50.786]  Headlines show this to everyone, to stop leftist terror attacks, or will the left stop their terror attacks?
[00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:53.211]  An attempt to overthrow Trump?
[00:51:53.211 --> 00:52:00.858]  I mean, Deep State promotes violence and terror to stop Trump?
[00:52:00.858 --> 00:52:01.799]  What do we do?
[00:52:01.799 --> 00:52:07.224]  Because we're in a position here where they're stabbing and shooting people every day.
[00:52:07.224 --> 00:52:09.867]  They're promoting death and destruction.
[00:52:09.867 --> 00:52:14.131]  They're allied with the most orthodox, radical forms of Wahhabist Islam.
[00:52:15.543 --> 00:52:22.446]  They are spreading across the globe their violent attacks not just here but in other countries against nationalists.
[00:52:22.446 --> 00:52:30.189]  They are teaching the most hardcore racist division garbage to weaponize the culture.
[00:52:30.189 --> 00:52:31.089]  It's incredible.
[00:52:31.089 --> 00:52:35.931]  The White House has put out a statement about Johnny Depp and we'll put that back up on screen if we get a chance.
[00:52:38.513 --> 00:52:39.874]  This is a crescendo.
[00:52:39.874 --> 00:52:50.322]  This is all these big Hollywood stars, all these big rock stars that have their little, you know, mentally ill followers that don't live themselves but live through them, who will now go out and carry out more violence.
[00:52:50.322 --> 00:52:58.909]  And you notice it's intensifying as the summer arrives with massive Soros funding July 2nd for violence in the streets.
[00:52:58.909 --> 00:52:59.909]  White House statement.
[00:52:59.909 --> 00:53:05.393]  President Trump is condemned to violence in all forms and it's sad that others like Johnny Depp have not followed his lead.
[00:53:05.393 --> 00:53:06.935]  I hope that some of Mr. Depp's
[00:53:08.137 --> 00:53:12.040]  Colleagues will speak out against this type of rhetoric.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.903]  Well, maybe people like Kurt Russell.
[00:53:15.903 --> 00:53:18.725]  Maybe people like Rick Linklater.
[00:53:18.725 --> 00:53:21.867]  Maybe people like Clint Eastwood.
[00:53:23.373 --> 00:53:25.515]  Maybe folks like Bruce Willis.
[00:53:25.515 --> 00:53:31.640]  But those guys kind of come out every once in a while and just say something that makes sense about America, and then like a turtle pull their head back in.
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:38.765]  I'm not telling Clint Eastwood what he should do, but I know he served in Korea and did a lot of other great things for this country, and I know he's a listener.
[00:53:38.765 --> 00:53:43.369]  Clint Eastwood should... I mean, if he wants to fight for the country, now more than ever.
[00:53:44.457 --> 00:53:48.560]  I wouldn't associate with people like Tom Hanks, who needs you, not the other way around.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.582]  Tom Hanks is the globalist piece of filth.
[00:53:50.582 --> 00:53:52.143]  It's time to stop associating with them.
[00:53:52.143 --> 00:53:54.945]  I wouldn't be part of the whole Hollywood combine.
[00:53:54.945 --> 00:53:58.007]  They need you, not the other way around.
[00:53:58.007 --> 00:53:59.969]  And I would come out and speak out about all this.
[00:53:59.969 --> 00:54:07.975]  And we need Kurt Russell, who I know is super smart, and I know is a listener of the show, to just come out and say, this is wrong, this is cultic, this is out of control.
[00:54:07.975 --> 00:54:12.698]  James Woods goes on Fox like once every two years.
[00:54:12.698 --> 00:54:13.639]  Puts out a lot of great tweets.
[00:54:14.872 --> 00:54:16.133]  You can tell he's fighting for this country.
[00:54:16.133 --> 00:54:17.634]  We need James Woods.
[00:54:17.634 --> 00:54:18.915]  Always loved James Woods.
[00:54:18.915 --> 00:54:25.381]  It's funny, like, every actor I ever really liked, like Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, James Woods, I didn't really even know their politics growing up, but those were the actors I liked.
[00:54:25.381 --> 00:54:27.542]  I didn't like Hollywood movies.
[00:54:27.542 --> 00:54:31.425]  Schwarzenegger, I thought his movies were okay, but, you know, he's a big liberal, fake conservative.
[00:54:31.425 --> 00:54:32.686]  Don't like Schwarzenegger.
[00:54:32.686 --> 00:54:39.412]  But everybody I always instinctively liked, it turned out, was a patriot.
[00:54:39.412 --> 00:54:41.614]  But it's still all just make-believe.
[00:54:42.892 --> 00:54:49.855]  And the reason we love these actors is that we were celebrating humanity, and who they remind us of in our own lives.
[00:54:49.855 --> 00:54:51.836]  That's it.
[00:54:51.836 --> 00:54:53.977]  But we don't live by watching that.
[00:54:53.977 --> 00:55:00.999]  We live by having our own lives, our own destiny, and having wide-eyed wonderment in the universe.
[00:55:00.999 --> 00:55:08.863]  And not just being purely competitive creatures, but to be competitive to build a better world, and to be strong, and to say no to tyrants.
[00:55:08.863 --> 00:55:11.824]  Because most so-called competitive men join the power structure.
[00:55:12.708 --> 00:55:17.610]  They think that's competitive to amass more money for themselves while they sell out their own culture.
[00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:27.894]  Real power, real manhood, real alpha leadership is bucking the trend when it's the right thing to do and not caring what the crowd says.
[00:55:27.894 --> 00:55:34.976]  You think I care when Hollywood scum attack me and when a pack of liars say I'm worthless and I'm evil and I'm bad?
[00:55:34.976 --> 00:55:38.718]  Telling the truth to the face of tyranny is
[00:55:40.376 --> 00:55:42.239]  The true act of resistance.
[00:55:42.239 --> 00:55:46.626]  George Orwell said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:55:48.015 --> 00:55:49.776]  And that's so true today.
[00:55:49.776 --> 00:55:54.379]  So again, all of you, the InfoWars listeners, you are why they hate InfoWars.
[00:55:54.379 --> 00:56:04.205]  Because you are diverse, you have diverse backgrounds, diverse ancestry, diverse culture, diverse religion, but you know evil when you see it.
[00:56:04.205 --> 00:56:07.066]  You have a soul that wants to resist tyranny.
[00:56:07.066 --> 00:56:11.409]  And they know you are tens upon tens upon tens of millions just in the U.S.
[00:56:12.904 --> 00:56:18.390]  I walk down the street now in Austin and every third person wants to shake my hand or get a photo.
[00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:23.176]  I walk down the street and I hear people listening to me on their phones.
[00:56:23.176 --> 00:56:27.741]  They'll pull earbuds out and I'll be sitting next to a guy and he goes, I'm just listening to you.
[00:56:27.741 --> 00:56:31.646]  Then I walk outside and the person in my car is listening.
[00:56:33.337 --> 00:56:53.640]  Imagine if they took action, if they spread links, if they started their own podcast, if they called in to C-SPAN, if they... Whatever the case is, if they bought some of the products, because only a fraction of the listeners are buying the Super Blue Fluoride Free Game Changing Coil Silver Iodine Toothpaste, or the Emrix Essentials, or X2, the good halogen that changed my life so much.
[00:56:54.461 --> 00:56:59.705]  Frankly, I got really lazy taking it because it made me lose like 35 pounds on top of the 30 I'd lost.
[00:56:59.705 --> 00:57:00.706]  Then I work out a lot less.
[00:57:00.706 --> 00:57:05.149]  I'm starting to put a few back on because, I mean, it's just, it sped up my metabolic system.
[00:57:05.149 --> 00:57:07.751]  It's such a detoxifier.
[00:57:07.751 --> 00:57:08.852]  Most people are deficient.
[00:57:08.852 --> 00:57:11.554]  Most of the iodine in the environment you don't actually absorb.
[00:57:11.554 --> 00:57:12.235]  This you do.
[00:57:12.235 --> 00:57:13.395]  It's amazing.
[00:57:13.395 --> 00:57:16.678]  It's very powerful, though, so consult your health care provider or do your own research.
[00:57:16.678 --> 00:57:18.840]  SurvivalShieldX2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:57:21.249 --> 00:57:24.095]  Or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:57:24.095 --> 00:57:25.659]  And quite frankly, I don't know how long we'll be able to get it.
[00:57:26.570 --> 00:57:28.971]  From this rare earth crystal source, quite frankly.
[00:57:28.971 --> 00:57:33.272]  And there's other stuff going on, so I might not even be able to... X2 might not exist in six months.
[00:57:33.272 --> 00:57:35.272]  I don't want to say that just to sell it.
[00:57:35.272 --> 00:57:36.453]  I'm not.
[00:57:36.453 --> 00:57:39.733]  I don't know if X2, quite frankly, is going to be available.
[00:57:39.733 --> 00:57:40.474]  It's just going to be gone.
[00:57:40.474 --> 00:57:43.154]  We can go back to the old seaweed base.
[00:57:43.154 --> 00:57:46.075]  It's very pure, very clean, but not as strong.
[00:57:46.075 --> 00:57:47.516]  But if you want X2, it's available.
[00:57:47.516 --> 00:57:49.756]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139, and your purchase again.
[00:57:53.632 --> 00:57:55.333]  That's everything we do here possible.
[00:57:55.333 --> 00:57:57.814]  Then again, I'm wearing this t-shirt today.
[00:57:57.814 --> 00:58:07.819]  I thought because the Civil War pretty much started, I ought to just put on, you know, combat gear here, metaphysically, but also just to note that that's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:07.819 --> 00:58:13.022]  Towards Washington, with the Reeves around him, honoring our great founder.
[00:58:13.022 --> 00:58:15.543]  All he did is an example against tyranny.
[00:58:15.543 --> 00:58:19.265]  Then Infowars.com over the heart and on the back.
[00:58:19.265 --> 00:58:22.146]  My free speech doesn't end when you get offended.
[00:58:22.146 --> 00:58:23.187]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:24.375 --> 00:58:27.138]  So I believe this is the most important shirt we've got.
[00:58:27.138 --> 00:58:33.304]  We don't even hardly sell it, but it's got really high quality fabric, but it costs a little bit more.
[00:58:33.304 --> 00:58:35.766]  And I believe this is a shirt everyone needs.
[00:58:35.766 --> 00:58:36.347]  We'll be back.
[00:58:36.347 --> 00:58:37.328]  Please spread the word.
[00:58:37.328 --> 00:58:39.830]  It is an info war and you are the key to it all.
[00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:41.111]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:41.111 --> 00:58:43.474]  Please support our local affiliates.
[00:58:43.474 --> 00:58:45.255]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.694 --> 00:58:56.177]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:58:56.177 --> 00:58:57.017]  I take this.
[00:58:57.017 --> 00:58:58.158]  My family takes this.
[00:58:58.158 --> 00:59:02.440]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:06.882]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:59:07.042 --> 00:59:11.684]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:59:11.684 --> 00:59:12.805]  I don't feel good.
[00:59:12.805 --> 00:59:16.567]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:59:16.567 --> 00:59:19.268]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:59:19.268 --> 00:59:25.051]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:59:25.051 --> 00:59:28.012]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:59:28.012 --> 00:59:31.554]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:59:31.554 --> 00:59:33.795]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:59:33.795 --> 00:59:34.155]  I love it.
[00:59:34.295 --> 00:59:37.096]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:59:37.096 --> 00:59:38.116]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:59:38.116 --> 00:59:43.777]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:59:43.777 --> 00:59:45.938]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:59:45.938 --> 00:59:47.178]  It's a win-win.
[00:59:47.178 --> 00:59:51.519]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:51.519 --> 00:59:54.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.559 --> 01:00:05.681]  Man, I am so psynched with Trump.
[01:00:05.681 --> 01:00:15.148]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.148 --> 01:00:19.071]  And I'm the big bad monster, I'm the big bad wolf, I'm the bad guy.
[01:00:19.071 --> 01:00:21.993]  So said the MSM that lies continually, so I'm pretty honored.
[01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:25.595]  You know, I say I'm psynched with Trump, this is common sense.
[01:00:25.595 --> 01:00:27.337]  This morning I meant to open the show.
[01:00:29.312 --> 01:00:35.342]  Offering to campaign for Nancy Pelosi to stay in the Speakership of the House of Representatives.
[01:00:35.342 --> 01:00:38.527]  She was previously that, now she's the Democratic leader.
[01:00:38.527 --> 01:00:41.592]  I was going to campaign for her to remain the Democratic leader.
[01:00:44.212 --> 01:00:49.955]  Because obviously she's such a doddering, corrupt, out-of-touch, Looney Tunes piece of work.
[01:00:49.955 --> 01:00:52.256]  Democratic fundraisings at an all-time low.
[01:00:52.256 --> 01:00:55.717]  They've thrown every bit of money they had in the last four special elections and failed.
[01:00:55.717 --> 01:00:58.759]  And sure enough, POTUS made the same point.
[01:00:58.759 --> 01:01:04.922]  It would be a very, very sad day for Republicans if Nancy Pelosi steps down, says Trump.
[01:01:04.922 --> 01:01:06.483]  That's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:01:06.483 --> 01:01:09.184]  I want to post this on InfoWars.com.
[01:01:09.184 --> 01:01:11.605]  Trump meets with top CEOs.
[01:01:11.605 --> 01:01:13.406]  So we're going to get that video and play that for you.
[01:01:16.361 --> 01:01:18.723]  Oh my gosh, that is so delicious.
[01:01:18.723 --> 01:01:22.405]  So that's just some of the news that's up on Drudge.
[01:01:22.405 --> 01:01:26.287]  Some of the other news, Johnny Depp jokes about Trump assassination backlash.
[01:01:26.287 --> 01:01:27.788]  Yeah, I hope nobody kills him.
[01:01:27.788 --> 01:01:30.830]  I mean, you know, he is calling for civil war and murder.
[01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:32.832]  We're pushing it, part of the trend.
[01:01:32.832 --> 01:01:35.093]  Eleventh Hollywood star to imagine violence.
[01:01:35.093 --> 01:01:37.234]  Yeah, that's a good article, I'm going to go over that.
[01:01:37.234 --> 01:01:40.376]  MSNBC president like suicide bomber.
[01:01:40.376 --> 01:01:42.358]  Federal Republican congressman attacked, threatened.
[01:01:43.649 --> 01:01:44.911]  I'm going to go over all those.
[01:01:44.911 --> 01:01:52.820]  Update, Democratic official caught saying, I'm glad Scalise got shot.
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.881]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[01:01:53.881 --> 01:01:55.303]  That's the trend for civil war.
[01:01:56.937 --> 01:02:00.778]  Then we've got Pelosi, we've got President Trump saying, keep her!
[01:02:00.778 --> 01:02:19.942]  But see, I almost didn't want to come celebrate this, because the Democrats might get wise and get rid of her, but see, there's such a dictatorship of Schumer in the Senate, and Pelosi in the House, and then David Brock's like the brain that like runs their, you know, their operations and stuff, and you know, the skeletons all, you know, meet there.
[01:02:21.886 --> 01:02:22.106]  I don't
[01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:50.950]  Well, let's just say he doesn't have as powerful a demon in him as his father.
[01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:52.691]  He has like a slimer demon or something.
[01:02:52.691 --> 01:02:56.971]  He's got like a little, some kind of little goblin creature spirit.
[01:02:56.971 --> 01:03:00.232]  I mean, we're talking about rat-level creatures here.
[01:03:00.232 --> 01:03:08.674]  But, what does it say about us if rat-crazed, spirit-cooking, Aleister Crowley-loving little dweebies
[01:03:09.778 --> 01:03:11.698]  Who've drank their own wimp Kool-Aid.
[01:03:11.698 --> 01:03:14.399]  They want to pull down the whole universe because they're such wimps.
[01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:15.419]  They're so ugly.
[01:03:15.419 --> 01:03:17.220]  They're so twisted.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:20.361]  They want to pull everybody else down so they can feel powerful above it.
[01:03:20.361 --> 01:03:21.961]  It's not going to work that way.
[01:03:21.961 --> 01:03:27.242]  We've had so much prosperity dumbos that people kind of tolerated you.
[01:03:27.242 --> 01:03:28.883]  They didn't want to look at you.
[01:03:28.883 --> 01:03:33.104]  But now, now you will face the full fury.
[01:03:39.706 --> 01:03:42.488]  And I've been waiting for this a long time.
[01:03:42.488 --> 01:03:48.152]  Now we're going to go to break soon and come back with Max Keiser from Mexico City.
[01:03:48.152 --> 01:03:54.516]  And then I've got a powerful Joe Rogan clip I meant to get to yesterday that I've got to play about Evergreen College and the mental illness by design.
[01:03:54.516 --> 01:03:58.960]  And then I've got a powerful, when I say powerful, am I overusing the word?
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:05.805]  Very important, poignant, thought-provoking piece by George Garland that I'd never heard
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.903]  With him on politics, political correctness, and more.
[01:04:08.903 --> 01:04:14.150]  We're going to air both of those this hour after Max Keiser leaves us.
[01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:19.157]  If the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek, or if the hair doesn't lip the Admiral.
[01:04:19.157 --> 01:04:21.921]  They say, oh don't use those old fashioned British terms, it hurts my hair lip.
[01:04:22.765 --> 01:04:24.386]  Not meant to hurt someone with a hair lip.
[01:04:24.386 --> 01:04:26.407]  It's an old saying.
[01:04:26.407 --> 01:04:31.769]  And we've got to start using the old sayings or they're going to have a monopoly on words and tell us what words to use.
[01:04:31.769 --> 01:04:33.510]  It's total tyranny.
[01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:35.251]  It's control of language.
[01:04:35.251 --> 01:04:36.992]  It's out of control by design.
[01:04:36.992 --> 01:04:47.077]  And then Michael Malice, an expert on North Korea, the unauthorized biography on Dear Leader, that's the name of the book, will be joining us on the nightmare, I mean the heaven,
[01:04:47.998 --> 01:04:51.943]  of the utopic communist country of North Korea.
[01:04:51.943 --> 01:04:57.732]  We'll also look at the implosion of other wonderlands like Cuba and Venezuela.
[01:05:00.155 --> 01:05:03.977]  Wow, you're going to love the latest idea out of the EU.
[01:05:03.977 --> 01:05:14.561]  Ska Keller, a German member of the European Parliament and of the Green Party, said we should transplant entire villages from Syria to Germany and that would encourage more migrants to enter Germany.
[01:05:14.561 --> 01:05:15.842]  Listen to these quotes.
[01:05:15.842 --> 01:05:23.645]  The idea of Syrian villages is only one possibility we can use, for example, if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees.
[01:05:23.905 --> 01:05:29.387]  People would rather go where compatriots already live, which makes integration and acceptance easier.
[01:05:29.387 --> 01:05:31.388]  Let's look at these three compatriots.
[01:05:31.388 --> 01:05:32.648]  From Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:05:32.648 --> 01:05:33.048]  Sweden.
[01:05:33.048 --> 01:05:35.989]  Migrants viciously beat disabled men while calling him racist.
[01:05:35.989 --> 01:05:42.191]  Three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a homeless man's wallet in a train station during an incident which took place last month.
[01:05:42.191 --> 01:05:49.214]  The handicapped man was kicked and punched and received a vicious uppercut as one of the migrants lectured him about war on Muslims and how all Swedes were racist.
[01:05:49.534 --> 01:05:51.438]  Now how's that for acceptance?
[01:05:51.438 --> 01:05:54.703]  You can read both articles now on InfoWars.com.
[01:05:54.703 --> 01:05:57.869]  Roger reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:05:59.264 --> 01:06:09.871]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:06:09.871 --> 01:06:11.932]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:06:11.932 --> 01:06:14.794]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:06:14.794 --> 01:06:16.275]  It's made in the USA.
[01:06:16.275 --> 01:06:19.417]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:06:19.657 --> 01:06:23.100]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.181]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:34.889]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:06:34.889 --> 01:06:47.218]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[01:06:47.398 --> 01:06:51.700]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level, and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:55.002]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:06:55.002 --> 01:06:56.583]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[01:06:56.583 --> 01:06:57.263]  With a Z-Shield.
[01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:59.064]  At InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:06:59.064 --> 01:07:08.169]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:08.169 --> 01:07:16.274]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:16.554 --> 01:07:21.436]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:21.436 --> 01:07:28.218]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:28.218 --> 01:07:35.401]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:35.401 --> 01:07:42.243]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:42.423 --> 01:07:46.910]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:50.294]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:07:50.294 --> 01:07:56.603]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:07:56.603 --> 01:07:58.286]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[01:08:00.916 --> 01:08:07.382]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:27.459 --> 01:08:35.368]  MSNBC's Alyssa Jordan, who was married to Michael Hastings, she was formerly a top aide on the National Security Council for Obama.
[01:08:38.186 --> 01:08:41.807]  She is saying that Trump is like a suicide bomber.
[01:08:41.807 --> 01:08:51.030]  We have another MSNBC host saying ISIS should target Trump properties like Trump Tower, but he's violent, he's like a suicide bomber.
[01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:57.232]  That's coming up in a moment, then Max Keiser joins us from Mexico City with breaking news on the economy, politics, and more.
[01:08:57.232 --> 01:09:00.453]  Always interesting and informative when Max Keiser joins us.
[01:09:00.453 --> 01:09:01.733]  But first, here's Johnny Depp.
[01:09:02.802 --> 01:09:14.507]  A guy from Kentucky, trying to have a kind of quasi-Atlantic accent, British accent, talking about getting Trump in the dark, stomping on him with Doc Martens.
[01:09:14.507 --> 01:09:16.888]  I mean, there's a longer clip, we played it last hour.
[01:09:16.888 --> 01:09:19.849]  And then saying, has an actor killed a president?
[01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:26.292]  So, it's all part of this pushing the narrative, and you've got Democrats getting caught saying they hope Scalise dies, and you've got
[01:09:27.386 --> 01:09:33.730]  When Trump says, you know, let's have prayers for him and his family, and for the police officers, and then the Democrats boo and hiss.
[01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:40.615]  I mean, these are truly sickening people who are incredibly wimpy, is the other part.
[01:09:40.615 --> 01:09:43.296]  Most of them don't have jobs, most of them are mentally ill.
[01:09:43.296 --> 01:09:50.141]  I mean, you go to a Democratic Party event, it looks like, it looks like Day of the Dead.
[01:09:50.141 --> 01:09:51.742]  Especially, especially the young people.
[01:09:51.742 --> 01:09:52.982]  It's very, very sad.
[01:09:52.982 --> 01:09:53.683]  What has happened?
[01:09:53.683 --> 01:09:54.704]  Well, look at Johnny Depp!
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:58.912]  He looks like a cross between a meth head and a lot lizard.
[01:10:00.173 --> 01:10:03.215]  You know, that you mix in with a child molester creeping around in a white van.
[01:10:03.215 --> 01:10:08.357]  I'm not saying he's a child molester, but Johnny Depp looks like a child molester.
[01:10:08.357 --> 01:10:11.979]  And he's all shaken from all the drugs he's taken and can hardly talk.
[01:10:11.979 --> 01:10:17.421]  What's going to happen if somebody walks up to him because they don't like him pushing Civil War and pumps a bunch of bullets into him?
[01:10:17.421 --> 01:10:24.464]  Or God forbid, don't blame the Second Amendment, they walk up and pull out a double-edged dagger and just grab him by the back of the head and start running it into him.
[01:10:24.464 --> 01:10:25.525]  I hope that doesn't happen.
[01:10:26.365 --> 01:10:28.826]  Because they're all hoping for violence and stuff.
[01:10:28.826 --> 01:10:29.806]  I'm scared of violence.
[01:10:29.806 --> 01:10:32.427]  I don't want anything to do with it.
[01:10:32.427 --> 01:10:36.689]  Now let's go ahead and, uh, because we're winning the Info War so good, why would we have that?
[01:10:36.689 --> 01:10:39.170]  But don't worry, there'll be time enough for whatever they want.
[01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:40.991]  I'm sure they're gonna get what they want.
[01:10:40.991 --> 01:10:45.272]  Here's, uh, Johnny Creeper Van Depp.
[01:10:45.272 --> 01:10:46.833]  I think he needs help.
[01:10:51.963 --> 01:10:55.985]  A lot of wonderful dark, dark places you could go.
[01:10:55.985 --> 01:11:02.989]  A lot of Doc Martens in the, uh... It's just a question.
[01:11:02.989 --> 01:11:04.670]  I'm not insinuating anything.
[01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:06.171]  By the way, this is gonna be in the press.
[01:11:06.171 --> 01:11:08.753]  It'll be horrible.
[01:11:08.753 --> 01:11:10.934]  But I'd like, I like that you're all a part of it.
[01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:16.417]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[01:11:16.417 --> 01:11:18.598]  Connie thinks it's so cool.
[01:11:18.598 --> 01:11:20.039]  For some drug addict.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:31.148]  Now, I want to clarify, I'm not an actor.
[01:11:31.148 --> 01:11:32.990]  I lie for a living.
[01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:37.336]  No, what you are is a rotten-toothed little snake.
[01:11:37.336 --> 01:11:37.937]  It's been a while.
[01:11:40.179 --> 01:11:43.002]  I mean, just look at him trying to act cool.
[01:11:43.002 --> 01:11:46.265]  They all try to dress like gypsies, and it's just... Give me a break!
[01:11:46.265 --> 01:11:47.626]  Get a job, man!
[01:11:47.626 --> 01:11:57.735]  $600 million that you didn't give to charity, that you blew and lost because you're such a moron, and you've got all these fake supposed friends around you.
[01:12:01.769 --> 01:12:11.255]  Imagine just waddling around acting cool like Johnny Depp does all day, when if he didn't have the money and he wasn't in movies, people go, oh look, there's another junkie!
[01:12:11.255 --> 01:12:12.976]  There's another meth mouth!
[01:12:12.976 --> 01:12:18.659]  There's another rotten-toothed, know-it-all piece of crap that wants a war with hard-working people!
[01:12:20.196 --> 01:12:25.560]  Because all the degenerate Hollywood folks hate Christians, that's why they hate Russia, that's why they hate America.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.142]  They're a bunch of devil-worshipping crap.
[01:12:29.142 --> 01:12:33.025]  And America is scraping it off the bottom of our shoes.
[01:12:33.025 --> 01:12:36.327]  And pretty soon, Hollywood's going to be totally bankrupt.
[01:12:36.327 --> 01:12:45.133]  Everybody should stop seeing their movies, should stop watching what they do, should just only analyze their propaganda so folks know it's poison.
[01:12:45.133 --> 01:12:48.376]  And just point out, that's poison, that's death, that's destruction.
[01:12:49.235 --> 01:12:52.536]  Now, here is Michael Hastings' wife.
[01:12:52.536 --> 01:12:53.156]  Remember his car?
[01:12:53.156 --> 01:12:56.476]  It blew up going down the road?
[01:12:56.476 --> 01:12:58.777]  Joe Biggs was at the funeral.
[01:12:58.777 --> 01:13:00.497]  She said, I'm going to get these bastards.
[01:13:00.497 --> 01:13:01.497]  They killed him.
[01:13:01.497 --> 01:13:04.058]  But then when she went on Piers Morgan, she said, oh, nothing happened.
[01:13:04.058 --> 01:13:05.838]  It was totally normal.
[01:13:05.838 --> 01:13:10.439]  Now she's saying the president's like a suicide bomber, and he doesn't ever keep his word.
[01:13:10.439 --> 01:13:15.180]  No, that's why they're mad, is because he's really keeping his word on almost every agenda.
[01:13:16.007 --> 01:13:20.931]  And then Congress is blocking him on tax cuts and things like that, but the regulations are the equivalent of tax cuts.
[01:13:20.931 --> 01:13:21.252]  Here it is.
[01:13:22.113 --> 01:13:23.714]  The broadcast, I said bluff.
[01:13:23.714 --> 01:13:25.436]  I said the president was bluffing.
[01:13:25.436 --> 01:13:27.538]  I may have been perhaps too fair.
[01:13:27.538 --> 01:13:32.542]  It would seem as if the president may have been lying all along about the existence of these tapes.
[01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:39.188]  No, he's just wasting, he wasted the country's collective time speculating over whether these tapes existed or not.
[01:13:39.188 --> 01:13:42.390]  It's a sad day when you cannot depend on the president's word.
[01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:47.855]  And my advice would just be to Republicans who do cozy up to him, it's just like hugging a suicide bomber.
[01:13:47.855 --> 01:13:49.657]  He blows you up in the process with him.
[01:13:50.277 --> 01:13:52.317]  It's like, that's a little strong, Elise.
[01:13:52.317 --> 01:14:02.619]  Yeah, I mean, this is not, I mean, look at what, if you go out on a limb, if you're a Republican who went out on a limb and defended Donald Trump over saying, well, he's got tapes that are going to back up his point of view.
[01:14:02.619 --> 01:14:03.419]  I'll keep going, yeah.
[01:14:03.419 --> 01:14:05.620]  No, no, exactly.
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:13.621]  She knows a lot about bombs because her husband got blown up and I'm sad that happened.
[01:14:13.621 --> 01:14:15.922]  But if you hug Trump, he blows you up.
[01:14:15.922 --> 01:14:16.702]  He lies to you.
[01:14:18.902 --> 01:14:27.589]  No, he said you better be careful there aren't tapes because he knew what he really said to Comey and he bluffed Comey.
[01:14:27.589 --> 01:14:29.911]  Into telling the truth.
[01:14:29.911 --> 01:14:31.893]  That he didn't try to obstruct justice.
[01:14:31.893 --> 01:14:32.913]  So what did the MSM do?
[01:14:32.913 --> 01:14:34.535]  They just said it's not real.
[01:14:34.535 --> 01:14:36.476]  Comey never said that he didn't obstruct.
[01:14:36.476 --> 01:14:37.217]  Comey never said that.
[01:14:37.217 --> 01:14:38.398]  Really, I have the clips.
[01:14:38.398 --> 01:14:41.420]  Maybe we should play them again.
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:45.684]  That's how stupid they think we are.
[01:14:45.684 --> 01:14:46.725]  Now continuing here.
[01:14:49.036 --> 01:14:55.121]  I want to deal with some other issues that are very, very important.
[01:14:55.121 --> 01:15:01.647]  We're going to do that at about 40 after when Max Keiser leaves us.
[01:15:01.647 --> 01:15:06.011]  DWS says Jay Johnson is wrong in every respect.
[01:15:06.011 --> 01:15:08.052]  That's Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[01:15:08.052 --> 01:15:10.675]  And that no one requested access to DNC servers.
[01:15:10.675 --> 01:15:12.256]  Remember all that?
[01:15:12.256 --> 01:15:15.399]  But Jay Johnson, who was the head of Homeland Security, he testified
[01:15:16.943 --> 01:15:21.006]  That they refused to let them look at the servers.
[01:15:21.006 --> 01:15:22.247]  But she says he's lying.
[01:15:22.247 --> 01:15:23.728]  So that's rats leaving the sinking ship.
[01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:24.729]  That's coming up.
[01:15:24.729 --> 01:15:26.950]  Then I've got a George Carlin piece I'm going to play.
[01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:29.792]  And I've also got a Joe Rogan piece I want to play because it's very, very important.
[01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:34.956]  And I want to give Joe and the professor the other piece of the puzzle.
[01:15:34.956 --> 01:15:40.560]  Because they're asking a question, but I'd like to give them the answer.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.381]  So that's coming up.
[01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:45.171]  Mike Cernovich is hosting the fourth hour.
[01:15:45.171 --> 01:15:51.934]  Michael Malice, an expert on North Korea and that communist heaven will be joining us as well coming up in the next hour.
[01:15:51.934 --> 01:15:54.235]  Now Max Keiser is in Mexico City.
[01:15:54.235 --> 01:15:56.376]  He does not need any introduction to our audience.
[01:15:56.376 --> 01:15:59.317]  He's been a busy man the last year, haven't had him on much.
[01:15:59.317 --> 01:16:01.678]  Max Keiser is a filmmaker, broadcaster and former
[01:16:02.463 --> 01:16:04.564]  Hey Alex, yeah, sorry I don't have the video set up.
[01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:38.409]  Yeah, Stacey has the song that we were going to do the video on, and I don't know where she went.
[01:16:38.409 --> 01:16:41.470]  It's okay, we'll have you back on tomorrow or something, whenever you want, with Skype.
[01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:52.334]  Because I loved you in Rome, I loved you in England, I loved you in Moscow, I loved you in all over the place you've come on the show.
[01:16:52.334 --> 01:16:57.476]  It's always amazing tours you give us, and I was looking forward to you walking around in Mexico City, but that's okay.
[01:16:57.476 --> 01:16:59.637]  What do you want to hit first, Mr. Kaiser?
[01:17:01.414 --> 01:17:06.717]  Well, Alex, I think there's a very big story here in Mexico, in Mexico City.
[01:17:06.717 --> 01:17:23.068]  You know, it's the country right on America's border, right on America's doorstep, and you compare it to the rhetoric that comes out of the mainstream media in America that's always about bashing Russia and Putin bashing, and they say things like he kills journalists.
[01:17:23.068 --> 01:17:27.391]  Well, journalists are getting killed all over the world, and probably
[01:17:28.389 --> 01:17:34.092]  Mexico is a place where you've got 90 to 100 journalists have been murdered over the past 10 years.
[01:17:34.092 --> 01:17:38.574]  It's like the journalist murder capital of the world and yet the mainstream media never talked about it.
[01:17:38.574 --> 01:17:48.999]  Here in Mexico City there's a real revolutionary spirit to try to push back against an authoritarian government that has got 30 million Mexicans on the verge of starvation.
[01:17:48.999 --> 01:17:52.641]  So what we're doing here Alex is I'm spreading the word of Bitcoin
[01:17:53.474 --> 01:17:58.319]  And MaxCoin, you know, MaxCoin is the coin that was created kind of in my honor.
[01:17:58.319 --> 01:18:01.543]  It's getting new all-time highs on record volumes.
[01:18:01.543 --> 01:18:03.344]  People can mine the coin.
[01:18:03.344 --> 01:18:09.391]  I'm talking to people all over the world that can mine cryptocurrencies on their desktop to give themselves economic freedom.
[01:18:09.391 --> 01:18:11.433]  Remember, Alex, a couple of years ago we did
[01:18:12.458 --> 01:18:13.319]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:18:30.610 --> 01:18:49.491]  Well I was about to say, from what I've seen in Brazil and Mexico and other areas, I wouldn't call it right wing, it's like super libertarian, absolutely sick of communism, socialism and fascism, but our media ignores that, and the Latin media is pretty establishment liberal like ours here, but is that not the case?
[01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:50.952]  What have you found in Latin America?
[01:18:50.952 --> 01:18:52.314]  Because I know you've traveled extensively.
[01:18:53.442 --> 01:18:56.063]  Well, American media doesn't want to accept the truth.
[01:18:56.063 --> 01:19:04.924]  You know, when we were in North Carolina before the election, the presidential election, we reported that we don't see any Hillary signs.
[01:19:04.924 --> 01:19:06.585]  All we see are Trump signs.
[01:19:06.585 --> 01:19:09.885]  We see great support for Trump.
[01:19:09.885 --> 01:19:14.686]  And we were accused of being pro-Russian because we were reporting the truth.
[01:19:14.686 --> 01:19:17.067]  And sure enough, Hillary lost North Carolina.
[01:19:17.067 --> 01:19:18.267]  Hillary lost Wisconsin.
[01:19:18.934 --> 01:19:22.518]  Americans are really being dumbed down by the mainstream media.
[01:19:22.518 --> 01:19:28.425]  And again, in fairness, you're on RT, which is international, but you've said they've never controlled what you say, what you do.
[01:19:28.425 --> 01:19:32.749]  I mean, but you've been on Al Jazeera, you've been on BBC, you've been on a bunch of other networks too.
[01:19:32.749 --> 01:19:33.971]  So, I mean, are you a British agent?
[01:19:33.971 --> 01:19:36.574]  Are you an Islamic agent?
[01:19:36.574 --> 01:19:40.198]  The only network that censored me aggressively was the BBC.
[01:19:41.044 --> 01:19:44.265]  The BBC is the worst of all international outlets.
[01:19:44.265 --> 01:19:50.888]  They control every single thing you say, they edit your show, and they cut things they don't like.
[01:19:50.888 --> 01:19:52.669]  The BBC is the worst.
[01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:55.810]  Alright, Max Keiser, maxkeiser.com, he's with us till 40 after.
[01:19:55.810 --> 01:19:57.911]  He's giving us vital intel.

[01:24:46.104 --> 01:24:48.505]  All right, Max Keiser, enough of my interruptions.
[01:24:48.505 --> 01:25:00.768]  Give us the big intel data dump of the state of the world, not just what's happening in Latin America, where you think the economy is, and what you think so far just as a political atheist, how Trump's doing.
[01:25:00.768 --> 01:25:05.509]  Well, Trump is fulfilling campaign promises to dump me to one degree or another.
[01:25:05.509 --> 01:25:07.550]  I think he's got to get through this cycle of
[01:25:08.399 --> 01:25:12.923]  You know, for example, the Veterans Administration, he just announced that he's going to protect whistleblowers.
[01:25:12.923 --> 01:25:14.043]  That's very good.
[01:25:14.043 --> 01:25:15.965]  He used to talk about building a wall.
[01:25:15.965 --> 01:25:17.646]  Now he's talking about building a solar wall.
[01:25:17.646 --> 01:25:20.128]  So he's keeping that alive.
[01:25:20.128 --> 01:25:29.035]  He's vilifying, I think, Mexico, which doesn't make a lot of sense for the points that I just pointed out.
[01:25:29.035 --> 01:25:33.859]  He is still reaching out to Russia because Russia, America, that is by far the best
[01:25:34.711 --> 01:25:35.311]  We're good to go.
[01:25:57.290 --> 01:26:06.778]  The Aramco, the American Arabian oil company public, at a $2 trillion valuation, it'll be the biggest company in the world.
[01:26:06.778 --> 01:26:07.558]  Why are they doing that?
[01:26:07.558 --> 01:26:09.600]  Because the price of oil is going down.
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.502]  Saudis want to sell oil now.
[01:26:12.502 --> 01:26:13.924]  They're hugely in debt.
[01:26:13.924 --> 01:26:16.426]  They need the cash to pay down their debt.
[01:26:16.426 --> 01:26:20.349]  Saudi Arabia is a country in social and economic collapse.
[01:26:20.769 --> 01:26:31.276]  They're sided now with their other extremist Wahhabist partners in the region to go against countries like, of course, Iran.
[01:26:31.276 --> 01:26:33.138]  Iran is always being picked on.
[01:26:33.138 --> 01:26:42.444]  That doesn't make any sense because Iran is not the belligerent force that the Saudis say that it is or America says that it is.
[01:26:42.444 --> 01:26:43.965]  It's all about the pipelines, Alex.
[01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:47.467]  If you throw a map of the pipelines and see who controls the pipelines, who's building
[01:26:48.468 --> 01:26:53.649]  You see America's trying to stop Russia from shipping gas from Russia to Europe.
[01:26:53.649 --> 01:27:00.411]  You see that the Saudis have combined with America to stop Russia from shipping gas to Germany.
[01:27:00.411 --> 01:27:01.451]  And here's the wild card.
[01:27:01.451 --> 01:27:14.194]  This has been my prediction for the next 18 months is that throughout this entire global conflict and lead up to World War III, this silent country, the country that we really don't know whose intentions, what their intentions are,
[01:27:15.157 --> 01:27:16.318]  It is Germany.
[01:27:16.318 --> 01:27:20.421]  Germany gets 30% of their gas, of their energy from Russia.
[01:27:20.421 --> 01:27:27.087]  They are starting to understand that Trump is not, according to them, not a reliable partner.
[01:27:27.087 --> 01:27:29.669]  And they want to spread their wings a little bit.
[01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:33.132]  And they want to side with Russia, China, Iran.
[01:27:33.132 --> 01:27:35.874]  Because that's the emerging block of power in the world.
[01:27:35.874 --> 01:27:36.214]  The U.S.
[01:27:36.214 --> 01:27:37.495]  and the U.K.
[01:27:37.495 --> 01:27:38.636]  Particularly, the U.K.
[01:27:38.636 --> 01:27:39.777]  is in free fall.
[01:27:39.777 --> 01:27:41.459]  Brexit is a disaster.
[01:27:41.459 --> 01:27:42.960]  Theresa May is horrendous.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:50.603]  Jeremy Corbyn is going to be Prime Minister in the next 6-9 months, which is great, he's a great guy, but Britain's going back to 1970.
[01:27:50.603 --> 01:28:01.526]  Tax rates are going back to 80-90% for the top bracket, which is great, but it means that their GDP is going to fall by a trillion dollars or more, and they're going back to 1970.
[01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:05.708]  So therefore, back to my original point,
[01:28:06.730 --> 01:28:09.052]  I think Germany is the key country going forward.
[01:28:09.052 --> 01:28:14.156]  My message going around the world, Alex, is to people need their individual economic sovereignty.
[01:28:14.156 --> 01:28:20.600]  Bitcoin has made millions of billionaires, maybe not millions of billionaires, but it's made tens of thousands of millionaires.
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:22.362]  The crypto coin market is exploding.
[01:28:22.702 --> 01:28:26.625]  I was about to say, you started pushing Bitcoin day one, and I thought it was all nebulous.
[01:28:26.625 --> 01:28:34.492]  I'm all for new independent currencies, but you have been proven 100% spot on on Bitcoin, and I just wish I would have gotten into it at the beginning.
[01:28:34.492 --> 01:28:37.995]  So we salute your accuracy, Kaiser.
[01:28:37.995 --> 01:28:40.216]  Well, several hundred thousand percent.
[01:28:40.216 --> 01:28:41.918]  I recommended it on your show for $3.
[01:28:41.918 --> 01:28:43.279]  It's recently been at $3,000.
[01:28:45.214 --> 01:28:49.737]  MaxCoin, you know, which was created on my show just to show people what it's all about.
[01:28:49.737 --> 01:28:54.700]  It's hitting new all-time highs of $0.24, $0.25, the all-time record volume.
[01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:57.782]  You know, it's number 150 on the market capitalization.
[01:28:57.782 --> 01:28:58.203]  Sure, sure.
[01:28:58.203 --> 01:29:00.584]  We've been hearing it's going to burst forever, though.
[01:29:00.584 --> 01:29:03.926]  It doesn't burst.
[01:29:03.926 --> 01:29:11.251]  The reason it doesn't burst is because banks are still in a state of extreme duress.
[01:29:12.884 --> 01:29:18.686]  The global banking system is kept alive with the cheap money from the central banks.
[01:29:18.686 --> 01:29:23.268]  Sure, so bitcoins, I mean, nothing's perfect, but compared to the banking system, it's a lot better.
[01:29:23.268 --> 01:29:25.349]  And so people are running into other avenues.
[01:29:25.349 --> 01:29:27.569]  What, hedging bets?
[01:29:27.569 --> 01:29:27.750]  Right.
[01:29:34.454 --> 01:29:37.254]  They're allowed to suppress it, but let me get your expert view on that.
[01:29:37.254 --> 01:29:40.215]  Final segment with Max Keiser, who I want to invite back.
[01:29:40.215 --> 01:29:47.196]  I just invited him here in the bright to come to Austin and spend three or four days with his co-hosting, and he's accepted to come here in about two weeks, so we're looking forward to that.
[01:29:47.196 --> 01:29:48.617]  Stay there, Max Keiser.
[01:29:48.617 --> 01:29:49.997]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.997 --> 01:29:52.537]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.537 --> 01:29:55.218]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.679 --> 01:30:05.542]  Donald Trump just held a rally in Iowa, and one of the people in attendance, our anonymous sources say, was Bill Clinton.
[01:30:05.542 --> 01:30:06.902]  Well, how do we know it was Bill Clinton?
[01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:17.167]  Because while Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise and the other three Americans who were shot at the ball field by a deranged Bernie supporter, Democratic operatives began blowing their Bill Clinton rape whistles.
[01:30:17.167 --> 01:30:22.690]  I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend.
[01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:27.732]  Somebody that I've got to know very well, Steve Scalise.
[01:30:27.732 --> 01:30:27.972]  Right?
[01:30:27.972 --> 01:30:33.995]  Because that's the only reason you would try to interrupt a president as he was sending out his thoughts and prayers to somebody who had recently been shot, right?
[01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:34.995]  Come on, work with me here.
[01:30:34.995 --> 01:30:37.196]  The Democrats can't even protest right.
[01:30:37.196 --> 01:30:38.397]  These people fail at everything.
[01:30:38.397 --> 01:30:42.719]  They lose elections, they lose public support, and now they look like thoughtless cowards.
[01:30:42.719 --> 01:30:43.699]  It's just as Trump said.
[01:30:43.699 --> 01:30:46.921]  Never fails.
[01:30:46.921 --> 01:30:47.221]  Never fails.
[01:30:48.010 --> 01:30:49.771]  You can check out the video on InfoWars.com.
[01:30:49.771 --> 01:30:53.694]  Protesters blow whistles as Trump sends thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise.
[01:30:53.694 --> 01:30:55.535]  And that part about Bill Clinton being in the audience?
[01:30:55.535 --> 01:30:56.575]  That was fake news.
[01:30:56.575 --> 01:30:58.997]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:30:59.994 --> 01:31:05.238]  Protect your skin with SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion by Emrix Essentials.
[01:31:05.238 --> 01:31:12.422]  Perfect for face and body, this natural, unscented sunscreen can be worn at all times of the day, whenever you need sun protection.

[01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:26.632]  This natural lotion contains 21% zinc oxide, which is the largest particle size used, and we do not use nanoparticles.
[01:31:26.632 --> 01:31:29.534]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.
[01:31:30.134 --> 01:31:34.255]  The organic oils help hydrate the skin, leaving it nice and smooth.
[01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:38.696]  The truly natural fragrance-free sunscreen for the most sensitive skin.

[01:32:00.678 --> 01:32:04.441]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:32:04.441 --> 01:32:12.186]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:32:12.186 --> 01:32:20.832]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:32:20.832 --> 01:32:27.417]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water,
[01:32:27.637 --> 01:32:35.044]  ...into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:32:35.044 --> 01:32:38.468]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:32:38.468 --> 01:32:49.519]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:32:49.599 --> 01:32:52.482]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[01:32:52.482 --> 01:32:55.585]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[01:32:55.585 --> 01:33:01.692]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:33:01.692 --> 01:33:06.577]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.857 --> 01:33:25.738]  Vice Kaiser is our guest from Mexico City.
[01:33:25.738 --> 01:33:26.998]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:26.998 --> 01:33:32.980]  I want to get more into the Democrats calling for civil war and what's happening in the economy and so much more.
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:38.902]  But I also found a George Carlin clip this morning that I never heard before where he lays out political correctness.
[01:33:38.902 --> 01:33:41.023]  So I thought we would air some of that coming up.
[01:33:41.023 --> 01:33:43.064]  And then I also have a clip I want to get to of Joe Rogan.
[01:33:43.064 --> 01:33:45.224]  In fact, we'll just play that first.
[01:33:45.224 --> 01:33:47.925]  We'll get to the other clip, I guess, later.
[01:33:47.925 --> 01:33:53.027]  And that deals with what's happening at Evergreen College and all these other colleges that are being shut down where
[01:33:55.233 --> 01:34:13.422]  They're saying we're going to have no whites on campus now, or no whites are allowed at the park, at the campus, and they're saying we're going to teach you about discrimination, even though these are white people, a lot of them that are from Eastern Europe, and were never even involved in their ancestral line oppressing black people.
[01:34:13.422 --> 01:34:15.303]  Less than 2% of the South had slaves.
[01:34:16.786 --> 01:34:19.487]  Those are people that died hundreds of years ago.
[01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:21.848]  What on earth is all of this about?
[01:34:21.848 --> 01:34:23.589]  What on earth is going on?
[01:34:23.589 --> 01:34:28.771]  It's about collectivized guilt, bullying people, and destroying language.
[01:34:28.771 --> 01:34:32.512]  Very powerful information that we're gonna be getting to.
[01:34:32.512 --> 01:34:35.353]  Don't forget, we've got free shipping running through 4th of July.
[01:34:35.353 --> 01:34:40.355]  I've extended it, but we've added a bunch of new specials because we do this every year around 4th of July.
[01:34:40.355 --> 01:34:45.297]  Some of the biggest specials, Brain Force Plus, amazing nootropic for the brain, 30% off.
[01:34:45.297 --> 01:34:46.338]  Just try a bottle of it.
[01:34:46.798 --> 01:34:48.379]  Now 20% more in each bottle.
[01:34:48.379 --> 01:34:50.741]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[01:34:50.741 --> 01:34:52.583]  Again, that's a bestseller, but we're discounting it.
[01:34:52.583 --> 01:34:54.664]  If you haven't tried it, you really need to.
[01:34:54.664 --> 01:34:58.988]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen, game-changing, life-changing for me.
[01:34:58.988 --> 01:35:03.972]  Z-Shield, our latest product with Shilogy and concentrated other compounds.
[01:35:05.765 --> 01:35:09.588]  Like Xeo likes to pull heavy metals and toxins out of the body.
[01:35:09.588 --> 01:35:12.851]  InfoWars high quality storable foods powered by MyPatriot supply.
[01:35:12.851 --> 01:35:14.452]  30-40% off.
[01:35:14.452 --> 01:35:16.554]  Nobody's got MyPatriot this low.
[01:35:16.554 --> 01:35:25.101]  Emrix Essentials entire line of outdoor products and toiletries are discounted 40% off on the sunscreen and the bug spray when you get them together.
[01:35:25.101 --> 01:35:27.883]  Living Defense is about to sell out but it's 20% off.
[01:35:27.883 --> 01:35:29.625]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:35:29.625 --> 01:35:31.286]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:35:31.286 --> 01:35:31.647]  In fact,
[01:35:32.643 --> 01:35:38.057]  A couple of these items, like Supermail, X2 and others, are about to sell out.
[01:35:40.808 --> 01:35:41.448]  Z-Shield.
[01:35:41.448 --> 01:35:42.488]  We did a limited run of that.
[01:35:42.488 --> 01:35:43.488]  It's the first run.
[01:35:43.488 --> 01:35:46.749]  That's going to sell out the next week at the current sales rate.
[01:35:46.749 --> 01:35:50.010]  So we're doing these specials while supplies last.
[01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:54.130]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:54.130 --> 01:35:56.591]  But do yourself a favor.
[01:35:56.591 --> 01:35:57.731]  Look into Living Defense.
[01:35:57.731 --> 01:35:59.091]  Look into Z-Shield.
[01:35:59.091 --> 01:36:00.311]  Look into X2.
[01:36:00.311 --> 01:36:02.792]  Look into Supermail or Super Female Vitality.
[01:36:02.792 --> 01:36:04.152]  Supermail does so good for men.
[01:36:04.152 --> 01:36:06.653]  I don't know why it's not a big seller with women.
[01:36:09.133 --> 01:36:12.655]  Particularly women, even bigger effect in the libido area.
[01:36:12.655 --> 01:36:13.756]  I'm just telling you.
[01:36:13.756 --> 01:36:14.997]  It's just a fact.
[01:36:14.997 --> 01:36:20.681]  I mean, you really notice the super male men do the next day or two days after they take it in the morning.
[01:36:20.681 --> 01:36:21.701]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[01:36:21.701 --> 01:36:23.022]  Infowarslive.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:23.022 --> 01:36:23.683]  Now, Max Keiser.
[01:36:28.257 --> 01:36:29.678]  You got caught off there by the break.
[01:36:29.678 --> 01:36:38.924]  You were getting into gold and silver, and while they're able to manipulate that down, then I want to ask you about the climate of violence against nationalism, the climate of violence against Russia.
[01:36:38.924 --> 01:36:41.306]  You've been called a Russian agent.
[01:36:41.306 --> 01:36:43.488]  I've had Congress and Hillary say
[01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:49.371]  That I actually tell the Russians what to do, and then they give me the hacked info with no proof.
[01:36:49.371 --> 01:36:56.635]  But I mean, it's still creepy when they're having Defense Department hearings in the House saying I am a Russian agent.
[01:36:56.635 --> 01:36:57.936]  I don't get called to testify.
[01:36:57.936 --> 01:36:59.797]  The FBI doesn't show up.
[01:36:59.797 --> 01:37:01.238]  I want to testify.
[01:37:01.238 --> 01:37:03.219]  I'm so sick of this crap.
[01:37:03.219 --> 01:37:04.760]  What's really going on here, Max Keiser?
[01:37:06.516 --> 01:37:12.280]  Well, Alex, I've got some exclusive news for you that'll be the first time anyone's ever heard about this.
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:28.170]  And it's a follow-up to what you just described as the Democrats, the Civil War, the backlash after the election from mainstream media against anyone who is supporting the President, and the complete
[01:37:30.692 --> 01:37:36.716]  I am working right now with my friend Stephen Baldwin, who I've known for 30 years.
[01:37:36.716 --> 01:37:39.117]  We're in pre-stage development, pre-development on a new R.T.
[01:37:39.117 --> 01:37:39.298]  show.
[01:37:53.429 --> 01:37:55.330]  That will go into the harbor.
[01:37:55.330 --> 01:38:03.712]  And Stephen and I are going to go, this will be in addition to my Kaiser Report show, this is a new show, in addition to my Kaiser Report show on RT.
[01:38:03.712 --> 01:38:07.853]  We're going to travel into America and we're going to talk to folks.
[01:38:07.853 --> 01:38:09.834]  And get, let them speak.
[01:38:09.834 --> 01:38:13.415]  Let them tell the world why, what they're thinking.
[01:38:13.415 --> 01:38:18.216]  Because nobody in Thanksgiving America, Thanksgiving media in America is allowing that conversation to take place.
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:24.066]  So it's a very exciting new media show, a new media project.
[01:38:24.066 --> 01:38:26.488]  And you know, we're in pre-production.
[01:38:26.488 --> 01:38:26.789]  R.K.'
[01:38:26.768 --> 01:38:27.329]  's on board.
[01:38:27.329 --> 01:38:28.711]  Stephen's on board.
[01:38:28.711 --> 01:38:37.099]  As a matter of fact, I just talked to Brock Pierce, who's one of the biggest names in crypto, about doing some sponsorship with us as well.
[01:38:37.099 --> 01:38:39.202]  We've got people like Dash.
[01:38:39.967 --> 01:38:41.708]  Oh yeah, how's that?
[01:38:41.708 --> 01:38:43.250]  Better?
[01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:44.070]  Oh, sorry.
[01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.871]  So, just to repeat, Alex,
[01:39:06.263 --> 01:39:07.964]  Yeah, we're in a civil war.
[01:39:07.964 --> 01:39:08.785]  I mean, the NSA and the CIA
[01:39:36.738 --> 01:39:37.739]  We're good to go.
[01:40:00.652 --> 01:40:01.132]  We're good.
[01:40:30.539 --> 01:40:33.141]  That Michael Flynn and Putin did not communicate.
[01:40:33.141 --> 01:40:37.224]  Putin came in, his seat is placed on the table as empty.
[01:40:37.224 --> 01:40:42.288]  He comes in late, watches the video, he makes a speech, and he leaves.
[01:40:42.288 --> 01:40:43.649]  There was no interaction.
[01:40:43.649 --> 01:40:46.231]  As you said, it's a Megyn Kelly.
[01:40:46.231 --> 01:40:54.718]  Talking to Megyn Kelly for two days during her interview, it made him a lot closer to Megyn Kelly than he's ever been to Michael Flynn.
[01:40:54.718 --> 01:40:58.381]  But the Democrats are imploding on this space.
[01:40:59.045 --> 01:41:04.807]  Trump-Russia connection, and they're going to just die with it because there's nothing, absolutely nothing there.
[01:41:04.807 --> 01:41:13.811]  And Trump knows that let these two agencies, the NSA and CAA, kill each other because it'll be great for America.
[01:41:13.811 --> 01:41:15.532]  Yeah, we're in a deep state.
[01:41:15.532 --> 01:41:17.633]  It's part of his big plan.
[01:41:17.633 --> 01:41:18.833]  I think he's got a plan.
[01:41:18.833 --> 01:41:22.055]  People say he's a rogue.
[01:41:22.055 --> 01:41:23.115]  I think that's false.
[01:41:23.115 --> 01:41:27.517]  I think he knows pretty well what he's doing, and I see success.
[01:41:27.967 --> 01:41:33.050]  You know, he inherited a country that was in pretty bad shape.
[01:41:33.050 --> 01:41:50.260]  Now, as far as the global economy goes, you still have global central banks bailing out other banks by printing lots of ridiculously fiat, nonsensical money, and this is leading to wealth and income gaps and leading to not only Civil War in America, but
[01:41:51.624 --> 01:42:00.366]  Exactly, and those very same entrenched ultra-rich don't want to have the general public have a nouveau riche or have a middle class.
[01:42:00.366 --> 01:42:02.067]  They admit it, and I've been meeting with
[01:42:17.051 --> 01:42:21.253]  A lot of wealthy folks, the same kind of folks you meet with, and they want a renaissance.
[01:42:21.253 --> 01:42:22.294]  They don't like what's happening.
[01:42:22.294 --> 01:42:30.838]  There's a major fissure in globalism because globalism was sold as a way to really make everybody successful and redistribute western wealth to help the third world.
[01:42:30.838 --> 01:42:33.279]  Instead, it exploits the third world.
[01:42:33.279 --> 01:42:43.504]  Now it's reversing colonialism and exploiting the first world for offshore global elites that say they want to go to a city-state model of like a gulag casino that you coined the term of.
[01:42:44.324 --> 01:42:49.571]  Of total control, a true breakaway civilization, Elysium level.
[01:42:49.571 --> 01:42:58.882]  And so a lot of the elites, as you've said and others have said, they don't want this but they have been bullied into this by the worst actors, the worst operatives in this.
[01:42:58.882 --> 01:43:02.567]  And so the reason globalism is falling apart is there's a crisis of confidence in it.
[01:43:03.087 --> 01:43:06.369]  And even as Peter Thiel and others have said, the tide is going out on it.
[01:43:06.369 --> 01:43:17.874]  So in the last minute we've got, do you agree with Peter Thiel that the tide on modern crony capitalist globalism is going out, and the elites better understand they're not going to get away with more crap?
[01:43:17.874 --> 01:43:19.195]  Yeah, it's very simple, Alex.
[01:43:19.195 --> 01:43:22.576]  It goes back to, what is the definition of money?
[01:43:22.576 --> 01:43:32.241]  Currently, the definition of money in America and around the world is that if you have a lot of it, if you make a mistake, you can print more and buy your way out of your mistake.
[01:43:32.995 --> 01:43:37.117]  If you don't have much of it, and you make a mistake, you go to prison.
[01:43:37.117 --> 01:43:38.357]  That's the system.
[01:43:38.357 --> 01:43:44.860]  Because those who are committing the biggest crime have access to the central bank, they can print an infinite amount of money.
[01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:52.183]  And they have an arrogance against everybody else or anybody else that, you know, might want to have a swimming pool or go on vacation, who makes money the old-fashioned way.
[01:43:52.183 --> 01:43:55.064]  It is total Marie Antoinette-level garbage.
[01:43:55.064 --> 01:43:57.925]  Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com promise, and I know you don't...
[01:43:58.345 --> 01:43:59.386]  Well, I'm a lot sexier than Megyn Kelly.
[01:43:59.386 --> 01:43:59.926]  I've got better legs.
[01:43:59.926 --> 01:44:01.226]  We've got a bromance, Alex.
[01:44:01.226 --> 01:44:01.807]  We've got a bromance.
[01:44:27.332 --> 01:44:28.153]  Yeah, baby.
[01:44:28.153 --> 01:44:28.973]  Let's get down to it.
[01:44:50.666 --> 01:45:02.769]  When I get up here and start talking fast and bounce off the walls, I prepare for hours at home, and then I prepare for hours at night, and then I've got all these clips and all this stuff to get to, and I just get frustrated that I'm not covering it all.
[01:45:02.769 --> 01:45:09.671]  I mean, there's so many death threats against the President, and the organized crime behavior is so over the top.
[01:45:11.167 --> 01:45:12.688]  That it's just my brain overheats.
[01:45:12.688 --> 01:45:13.768]  It's like too much information.
[01:45:13.768 --> 01:45:14.549]  Robbie the Robot.
[01:45:14.549 --> 01:45:17.170]  Cannot compute too much data.
[01:45:17.170 --> 01:45:19.411]  Press approaching from all angles.
[01:45:19.411 --> 01:45:20.912]  Traders everywhere.
[01:45:20.912 --> 01:45:24.854]  I don't know what to do at some point.
[01:45:24.854 --> 01:45:26.755]  But I'm trying my best here.
[01:45:26.755 --> 01:45:28.476]  The crew puts up with me, so that's what matters.
[01:45:28.476 --> 01:45:30.877]  But we're going to get to all of it.
[01:45:30.877 --> 01:45:35.579]  Now, this next piece of news is very, very important.
[01:45:35.579 --> 01:45:39.301]  Joe Rogan had the Evergreen University from Washington
[01:45:40.751 --> 01:45:56.244]  Guest on, the professor, Brett Weinstein, who's a liberal, who's an SJW, who I would call ultra-leftist.
[01:45:56.244 --> 01:46:02.669]  But he's the old left that at least agrees in free speech and an open discourse of ideas.
[01:46:02.669 --> 01:46:05.011]  Now, the college has been closed for weeks.
[01:46:05.011 --> 01:46:06.392]  This has been going on for over a month.
[01:46:07.719 --> 01:46:11.821]  The minority students said, we want the campus closed to white people because they're the problem.
[01:46:11.821 --> 01:46:13.582]  We need to genocide white people.
[01:46:13.582 --> 01:46:14.383]  They're the devil.
[01:46:14.383 --> 01:46:19.286]  There's new articles out saying, abort your white babies in mainstream feminist publications.
[01:46:19.286 --> 01:46:21.427]  Whites are inherently the source of all evil.
[01:46:21.427 --> 01:46:27.190]  This is Hitler's ideology, but inverted or flipped.
[01:46:27.190 --> 01:46:29.672]  And so Joe Rogan, who is, I'd call libertarian.
[01:46:29.672 --> 01:46:32.113]  I've known Joe like, hard to believe I'm this old now, 18, 19 years.
[01:46:36.454 --> 01:46:40.035]  And Joe is more of a mainline liberal, classic liberal from Boston.
[01:46:40.035 --> 01:46:43.616]  When I first met him, he just finished doing the show on NewsRadio.
[01:46:43.616 --> 01:46:44.496]  We got to be pretty good friends.
[01:46:44.496 --> 01:46:47.436]  And he's a smart guy.
[01:46:47.436 --> 01:46:50.917]  He's taught me a lot, but I want to explain something to Joe and to the professor.
[01:46:50.917 --> 01:46:54.498]  I watched the over hour-long interview on his podcast, it's excellent.
[01:46:54.498 --> 01:47:02.700]  But they keep wondering why the left is eating itself, why it's turning on itself, why it's blowing up, why it's so cancerous, why it's so hateful, why it's so racist, why it's so...
[01:47:04.963 --> 01:47:06.144]  Cult-like.
[01:47:06.144 --> 01:47:12.371]  Because the psychological warfare systems on record set this up as standardized academia.
[01:47:12.371 --> 01:47:15.675]  It's a war on culture.
[01:47:15.675 --> 01:47:16.856]  It's a war on ideas.
[01:47:16.856 --> 01:47:20.841]  It's a war on classical liberalism that the robber barons don't know what to do with.
[01:47:22.133 --> 01:47:28.694]  And so they've been funding this for a hundred years, getting control of the liberal movements that actually threaten the establishment.
[01:47:28.694 --> 01:47:31.055]  You know, Thomas Jefferson liberalism.
[01:47:31.055 --> 01:47:46.218]  Conservatism, you could say it would be George Washington, a very traditionalist, but Americana, and then you've got super extreme, wild freedom with Jefferson, who was the head of the Illuminati for a while, helped launch the French Revolution, barely got out of France, they wanted to kill him.
[01:47:46.218 --> 01:47:48.479]  He said, whoa, Washington's right, this is really bad.
[01:47:49.139 --> 01:47:51.161]  That's a big, complex, long history there.
[01:47:51.161 --> 01:47:52.582]  And you're going, the Illuminati?
[01:47:52.582 --> 01:47:54.264]  Jefferson was good?
[01:47:54.264 --> 01:47:56.126]  The real Illuminati, folks.
[01:47:56.126 --> 01:47:57.547]  Not the fake Illuminati.
[01:47:57.547 --> 01:48:00.230]  It's all in Washington's writings if you want to read it.
[01:48:00.230 --> 01:48:04.534]  Somebody's got to make a movie or write a book about this, because this is all in the history books, but no one even knows.
[01:48:04.534 --> 01:48:06.095]  It just means illuminated.
[01:48:06.095 --> 01:48:07.757]  It's like, you know, the rock band...
[01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:19.570]  Rush is talking about illumination, wide-eyed fascination with the universe, not wanting to be a jerk, not wanting to be evil, wanting to share knowledge, be illuminated.
[01:48:19.570 --> 01:48:21.112]  The globalists are the opposite.
[01:48:21.112 --> 01:48:22.574]  In the kingdom of the one-eyed man...
[01:48:25.103 --> 01:48:27.045]  The kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
[01:48:27.045 --> 01:48:30.048]  Well, this is the kingdom of the one-eyed man.
[01:48:30.048 --> 01:48:32.690]  They want the only knowledge, the only light.
[01:48:32.690 --> 01:48:33.411]  You don't get it.
[01:48:33.411 --> 01:48:35.873]  That's the false Illuminati.
[01:48:35.873 --> 01:48:37.835]  They call themselves the Illuminati.
[01:48:37.835 --> 01:48:39.397]  It was just the Enlightenment.
[01:48:39.397 --> 01:48:40.998]  It just means the Enlightenment.
[01:48:40.998 --> 01:48:42.740]  And it came out of Christianity.
[01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:43.901]  It came out of the Reformation.
[01:48:44.221 --> 01:48:45.562]  It came out of a lot of things.
[01:48:45.562 --> 01:48:54.108]  It came out of the Black Plague that killed about 40% of the population, mainly in the cities, wiped out the elites, wiped out the feudalism that had top-down control.
[01:48:54.108 --> 01:48:58.271]  So there's a lot of things that gave us the Renaissance and the Gutenberg Press and everything of 500 years ago.
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:23.257]  And there's been a fight between the forces of control and the forces of enlightenment since then, and the forces of control launched their own counter-enlightenment that was the extreme Illuminati, based on sex operations, devil worship, really what they saw as cutting-edge stuff they could get the royalty and the general elites into, because it wasn't kosher to go have sex orgies and do stuff like that.
[01:49:23.257 --> 01:49:25.798]  So it was kind of like, oh really, you're going to have an enlightenment over in America?
[01:49:25.798 --> 01:49:27.200]  And you're going to have a Christian enlightenment?
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:28.881]  We're going to have one with hot chicks!
[01:49:31.027 --> 01:49:33.389]  And, you know, devil parties.
[01:49:33.389 --> 01:49:38.633]  And so that's all it was, was a financed attempt to take down R-Real Operation.
[01:49:38.633 --> 01:49:44.597]  Now, continuing, I say R-Real Operation is my family on both sides, all over the place, right back at the start of it.
[01:49:44.597 --> 01:49:46.719]  I'm very, very, very proud of that.
[01:49:46.719 --> 01:49:48.901]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:49:50.902 --> 01:49:52.783]  They're wondering why all this is happening.
[01:49:52.783 --> 01:49:53.864]  They're wondering why it's all going on.
[01:49:53.864 --> 01:49:55.224]  Well, the professor knows.
[01:49:55.224 --> 01:50:02.148]  He knows this is standard doctrine and standard dogma being given to the colleges, being pushed to publications, being prepared for the public.
[01:50:02.148 --> 01:50:04.930]  So when we come back, I'm going to play part of this little seven-minute clip.
[01:50:06.431 --> 01:50:08.212]  That is up on Infowars.com.
[01:50:08.212 --> 01:50:09.913]  Joe Rogan rant left turning on itself.
[01:50:09.913 --> 01:50:14.836]  You want to see the full thing on YouTube, the full clip, then there's a larger multi-hour interview.
[01:50:14.836 --> 01:50:22.241]  I would like to get the professor on here, but they're acting like that this university, Evergreen College, is some anomaly.
[01:50:22.241 --> 01:50:24.322]  They're shutting down colleges all over the country.
[01:50:24.322 --> 01:50:25.783]  Enrollment at some of these things is 30-40% down because
[01:50:28.505 --> 01:50:35.800]  The anti-white racism is so bad, whites are literally being run off by groups of white professors saying, get me some muscle over here!
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:37.163]  Get these whites out of here!
[01:50:37.163 --> 01:50:38.405]  They're not allowed to be here!
[01:50:40.632 --> 01:50:44.395]  And people are laughing, going, I'm Asian, but that's wrong.
[01:50:44.395 --> 01:50:47.697]  I mean, it is just, it's beyond KKK.
[01:50:47.697 --> 01:50:51.720]  And it is mental illness in the people themselves that are under the control.
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:53.762]  But above it, there's a total plan.
[01:50:53.762 --> 01:50:56.124]  This is systematic authoritarianism.
[01:50:56.124 --> 01:50:58.385]  And George Collin, before he died, laid it all out as well.
[01:50:59.446 --> 01:51:04.227]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:51:04.227 --> 01:51:10.108]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:51:10.108 --> 01:51:16.609]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:51:16.609 --> 01:51:20.650]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[01:51:29.091 --> 01:51:34.394]  Being self-reliant is about being prepared and to do what you need to have your own source of renewable energy.

[01:51:58.991 --> 01:52:03.473]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[01:52:03.473 --> 01:52:11.436]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[01:52:11.436 --> 01:52:14.437]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[01:52:14.437 --> 01:52:18.439]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[01:52:18.439 --> 01:52:21.120]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:24.802]  It's by using the amazing Home Freeze Dryer from Harvest Right.
[01:52:25.482 --> 01:52:29.467]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[01:52:29.467 --> 01:52:34.694]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[01:52:34.694 --> 01:52:40.522]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting food on hand.
[01:52:40.522 --> 01:52:43.345]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[01:52:43.846 --> 01:52:45.567]  We love our freeze dryer.
[01:52:45.567 --> 01:52:48.369]  To learn more, go to harvestright.com or call 800-923-9591.

[01:52:58.550 --> 01:53:02.591]  Nearly one-third of FBI domestic terrorism cases involve refugees.
[01:53:02.591 --> 01:53:03.651]  One-third.
[01:53:03.651 --> 01:53:05.672]  There's already been riots across Europe.
[01:53:05.672 --> 01:53:06.872]  Is America next?
[01:53:06.872 --> 01:53:09.153]  Hi, I'm the owner of Infidel Body Armor.
[01:53:09.153 --> 01:53:14.354]  Over the past four years, I've sold thousands of body armor kits and trained hundreds of sheepdogs.
[01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:15.295]  They have prepared.
[01:53:15.295 --> 01:53:16.695]  Have you?
[01:53:16.695 --> 01:53:21.376]  I invite you to go to my website at infidelbodyarmor.com and click on Specials.
[01:53:21.376 --> 01:53:22.537]  Trouble is coming.
[01:53:22.537 --> 01:53:24.037]  Now do something about it.
[01:53:24.037 --> 01:53:27.078]  Infidelbodyarmor.com just won't quit.
[01:53:28.055 --> 01:53:28.935]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:53:28.935 --> 01:53:31.316]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:53:31.316 --> 01:53:39.359]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[01:53:39.359 --> 01:53:41.280]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:44.941]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:53:44.941 --> 01:53:49.603]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[01:53:49.603 --> 01:53:54.005]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[01:53:54.005 --> 01:53:54.645]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:54:01.015 --> 01:54:01.932]  Sure.
[01:54:25.191 --> 01:54:27.893]  All right, here are some excerpts in this segment and the next.
[01:54:27.893 --> 01:54:41.124]  Then authors joining us wrote the unauthorized biography of Kim Jong-un, the dear leader of another heavenly communist compound re-education country like North Korea.
[01:54:41.124 --> 01:54:44.467]  And that's what our colleges are turning into, is little Maoist
[01:54:46.115 --> 01:54:47.377]  Youth Movement Centers.
[01:54:47.377 --> 01:54:52.943]  In fact, if you go to most of the colleges like UT here in Austin, they model themselves off MAL.
[01:54:52.943 --> 01:54:56.407]  And MAL's Youth Brigades, and they call themselves the Red Guard of MAL.
[01:54:57.213 --> 01:54:58.494]  They don't even like Mao in China.
[01:54:58.494 --> 01:54:59.714]  The Communists don't like him there.
[01:54:59.714 --> 01:55:02.896]  They locked Mao's wife up until she died.
[01:55:02.896 --> 01:55:05.377]  But they don't even care that the Communists don't like Mao.
[01:55:05.377 --> 01:55:08.599]  The Red Guards here and all over the country, this is their model.
[01:55:08.599 --> 01:55:11.700]  Because it starts on the universities, then they're the Red Terror.
[01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:12.681]  They're the most vicious.
[01:55:12.681 --> 01:55:14.021]  They lead the assault.
[01:55:14.021 --> 01:55:15.762]  It starts there.
[01:55:15.762 --> 01:55:16.703]  They're the dumbest.
[01:55:16.703 --> 01:55:17.663]  They're the most violent.
[01:55:17.663 --> 01:55:18.724]  They're the stupidest.
[01:55:18.724 --> 01:55:23.226]  Just like with what happened in the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward that visited
[01:55:24.498 --> 01:55:26.359]  80 plus million dead.
[01:55:26.359 --> 01:55:32.061]  So let's go ahead and start playing some clips here of them wondering why this happened, why the universities are like this.
[01:55:32.061 --> 01:55:36.042]  Because it's by design, it's all engineered, and that is admitted.
[01:55:36.042 --> 01:55:36.702]  Here it is.
[01:55:36.702 --> 01:55:40.823]  Joe Rogan asks, why is the left turning on itself at Evergreen College?
[01:55:40.823 --> 01:55:42.064]  And this is Bert Weinstein.
[01:55:42.064 --> 01:55:42.344]  Here it is.
[01:55:43.264 --> 01:55:45.206]  It is very cult-like.
[01:55:45.206 --> 01:55:52.131]  And again, you know, you asked me what would have to happen for us to right the ship.
[01:55:52.131 --> 01:55:57.515]  The second one is that my faculty colleagues have to wake up to the fact that their belief structure is
[01:55:58.476 --> 01:56:03.762]  Um, has become bizarre and unrecognizable from any normal position.
[01:56:16.559 --> 01:56:32.062]  And this is how you view facts, and this is how you distort them, and then disseminate them to the rest of these like-minded folks in this very bizarre echo chamber that's being rejected, like, almost universally, outside of the college.
[01:56:32.062 --> 01:56:36.923]  I mean, it's not just Fox News it's rejecting, it's the Washington Post, it's the New York Times.
[01:56:36.923 --> 01:56:44.684]  People are freaking out about your situation and recognize very clearly and very rightly that you are absolutely not a racist.
[01:56:44.864 --> 01:56:45.024]  Right.
[01:57:04.184 --> 01:57:12.277]  I used to think of myself as a progressive, but what I have a problem with all of this is that the left is attacking itself now.
[01:57:12.277 --> 01:57:15.261]  It's like there's no one who's progressive enough.
[01:57:16.115 --> 01:57:16.595]  No one.
[01:57:16.595 --> 01:57:20.056]  Like, every single thing you do is a microaggression.
[01:57:20.056 --> 01:57:24.417]  Every single thing you do is based on white privilege and therefore you're racist.
[01:57:24.417 --> 01:57:31.099]  And unless you somehow or another give up all your money and give up all your jobs, and there are people who are asking to do that, too, by the way.
[01:57:31.099 --> 01:57:34.840]  There's people asking people to give their money and put them in black banks.
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:35.920]  Give them to black people.
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:37.361]  I mean, we're going crazy.
[01:57:38.204 --> 01:57:44.929]  This is literally, it's not an individual psychosis, but it's a collective psychosis that we're watching.
[01:57:44.929 --> 01:57:47.410]  And I believe that in literal terms.
[01:57:47.410 --> 01:57:50.412]  We are watching a kind of group insanity.
[01:57:50.412 --> 01:57:52.814]  Is this a problem with language?
[01:57:52.814 --> 01:58:03.621]  In some ways, is this a problem with influence and charisma and people's ability to... Joe, it's a power trip!
[01:58:03.621 --> 01:58:05.462]  Instead of people thinking about getting a good job,
[01:58:07.025 --> 01:58:11.412]  Being charming, working, enjoying their work, being successful.
[01:58:11.412 --> 01:58:13.836]  It's about being a victim.
[01:58:13.836 --> 01:58:17.361]  And so you've always got to expand that because that expands your value.
[01:58:18.513 --> 01:58:23.194]  And so you've got to make everyone else bad around you to elevate yourself.
[01:58:23.194 --> 01:58:30.577]  They're being given a psychological warfare system to destroy them because they're being given worthless educations in a de-industrialized economy.
[01:58:30.577 --> 01:58:35.658]  They're being psychologically sabotaged to then go out and destroy the rest of culture.
[01:58:35.658 --> 01:58:37.819]  This is a psych warfare weapon.
[01:58:37.819 --> 01:58:39.579]  It's declassified.
[01:58:39.579 --> 01:58:42.080]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:44.901]  It is psychological warfare.
[01:58:44.901 --> 01:58:47.882]  It is mass mental illness by design.
[01:58:49.608 --> 01:58:57.074]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:58:57.074 --> 01:59:10.305]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:59:11.229 --> 01:59:23.125]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:59:23.125 --> 01:59:29.092]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[01:59:29.833 --> 01:59:38.862]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[01:59:38.862 --> 01:59:51.954]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[01:59:51.954 --> 01:59:54.577]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:10.562 --> 02:00:11.683]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:11.683 --> 02:00:15.848]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.848 --> 02:00:23.555]  There I was, completely wasted, out of work and down.
[02:00:23.555 --> 02:00:28.400]  All inside, it's so frustrating, it's a dream town.
[02:00:34.662 --> 02:00:35.763]  We are back live.
[02:00:35.763 --> 02:00:40.544]  Joe Rogan, again, had the professor from Evergreen University who's had to leave because of death threats, you name it.
[02:00:40.544 --> 02:00:43.546]  The college has been shut for weeks.
[02:00:43.546 --> 02:00:46.227]  It's all just a giant mental illness pity party.
[02:00:46.227 --> 02:00:52.149]  You've all seen the videos of just hundreds and hundreds of screaming minorities.
[02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:53.790]  Screaming, get out whites, you're evil!
[02:00:53.790 --> 02:00:57.391]  And then finding professors that are in their offices and running up and screaming at them.
[02:00:57.391 --> 02:01:01.013]  And a lot of the white professors then agreed and said, we agree, you know, fire
[02:01:02.594 --> 02:01:05.776]  The biology professor who says it's racist to ban whites.
[02:01:05.776 --> 02:01:07.057]  Yes, fire him, fire him.
[02:01:07.057 --> 02:01:13.501]  So all getting into the bullying, getting into their own nest of control.
[02:01:13.501 --> 02:01:19.745]  Again, the weapon was meant to be turned outward for leftist control of society and guilting everyone into their paradigm.
[02:01:19.745 --> 02:01:21.065]  But because they've been contained,
[02:01:22.196 --> 02:01:23.518]  They're feeding on each other.
[02:01:23.518 --> 02:01:27.062]  Vampires need blood, and the parasites don't have it.
[02:01:27.062 --> 02:01:35.933]  And you can take white people, black people, anybody, and brainwash them like this, but you look at these young adults, they act like three-year-old babies throwing temper tantrums in these videos.
[02:01:35.933 --> 02:01:36.654]  Back to Joe Rogan.
[02:01:38.652 --> 02:01:38.972]  I don't
[02:02:02.532 --> 02:02:03.433]  Well, I would say there are many
[02:02:27.782 --> 02:02:29.283]  Is this faculty member a white person?
[02:02:54.649 --> 02:03:10.596]  So anyway, she says in a faculty meeting that this is a racist backlash, and I said to her in front of this faculty meeting, I said, somebody might want to check on the question of whether or not I'm actually a racist, because if you do check on it, you will discover I'm not.
[02:03:10.596 --> 02:03:13.617]  And if you don't, this is going to blow up on you.
[02:03:13.617 --> 02:03:22.321]  And the chair of the faculty told me that the faculty meeting was not the place to defend myself against accusations of racism.
[02:03:22.321 --> 02:03:22.941]  I said to her,
[02:03:23.852 --> 02:03:24.613]  That's fine.
[02:03:24.613 --> 02:03:28.975]  It's also not the place to level the accusations.
[02:03:28.975 --> 02:03:30.596]  But I said, where is the place?
[02:03:30.596 --> 02:03:36.980]  And then the faculty member who had made the accusation said, you should not expect there to be a venue in which to defend yourself.
[02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:39.761]  You should just get used to these accusations.
[02:03:39.761 --> 02:03:41.723]  In a separate case, I was told...
[02:03:42.483 --> 02:03:43.064]  Who said that?
[02:03:43.064 --> 02:03:43.645]  A white guy?
[02:03:43.645 --> 02:03:45.909]  No, it's the same faculty member who made the accusation.
[02:03:45.909 --> 02:03:47.673]  Wait a minute.
[02:03:47.673 --> 02:03:53.663]  The person said that you should just accept these untrue accusations.
[02:03:53.663 --> 02:03:53.844]  Yes.
[02:03:54.930 --> 02:03:55.831]  Um, yeah.
[02:03:55.831 --> 02:03:57.052]  And what was your reaction to that?
[02:03:57.052 --> 02:04:00.755]  That this is not a place for you to defend yourself against racist accusations.
[02:04:00.755 --> 02:04:02.677]  This is a place for you to just eat s***.
[02:04:02.677 --> 02:04:02.897]  Right.
[02:04:02.897 --> 02:04:04.358]  You just have to accept these accusations.
[02:04:04.358 --> 02:04:13.886]  On a separate occasion, we were also told that, um, that to question an allegation of racism is racist.
[02:04:13.886 --> 02:04:14.487]  Oh.
[02:04:14.487 --> 02:04:15.227]  How convenient.
[02:04:15.227 --> 02:04:15.628]  Yeah.
[02:04:15.628 --> 02:04:16.989]  I'm trying to wrap my head around that one.
[02:04:16.989 --> 02:04:17.309]  What?
[02:04:17.309 --> 02:04:21.332]  To question an accusation of racism is racist.
[02:04:21.332 --> 02:04:21.513]  Right.
[02:04:21.513 --> 02:04:22.854]  We have an obligation to believe that.
[02:04:23.354 --> 02:04:23.634]  Wow!
[02:04:23.634 --> 02:04:35.542]  The full interview is on Joe Rogan's website or you can just search engine the Joe Rogan podcast with the professor Bert Weinstein and find that.
[02:04:35.542 --> 02:04:36.843]  It's a powerful interview because
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:46.349]  These are really nice, mainline, progressive, you know, smart guys that are discovering the giant trap that this whole thing is.
[02:04:46.349 --> 02:04:52.315]  Because it's all over the country, it's all over the world, and it's about controlling knowledge and not letting you challenge your accusers.
[02:04:52.315 --> 02:04:57.541]  Just like they want me silenced in the media to just have Tom Brokaw call me a total racist with no proof.
[02:04:57.541 --> 02:04:58.102]  He just says it.
[02:05:00.072 --> 02:05:03.893]  Wow, you're going to love the latest idea out of the EU.
[02:05:03.893 --> 02:05:14.456]  Scott Keller, a German member of the European Parliament and of the Green Party, said we should transplant entire villages from Syria to Germany, and that would encourage more migrants to enter Germany.
[02:05:14.456 --> 02:05:15.736]  Listen to these quotes.
[02:05:15.736 --> 02:05:23.818]  The idea of Syrian villages is only one possibility we can use, for example, if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees.
[02:05:23.818 --> 02:05:27.519]  People would rather go where compatriots already live, which makes integration
[02:05:27.879 --> 02:05:29.279]  And acceptance easier.
[02:05:29.279 --> 02:05:31.300]  Let's look at these three compatriots.
[02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:32.561]  From Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:05:32.561 --> 02:05:35.902]  Sweden migrants viciously beat disabled men while calling him racist.
[02:05:35.902 --> 02:05:42.104]  Three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a homeless man's wallet in a train station during an incident which took place last month.
[02:05:42.104 --> 02:05:49.126]  The handicapped man was kicked and punched and received a vicious uppercut as one of the migrants lectured him about war on Muslims and how all Swedes were racist.
[02:05:49.446 --> 02:05:51.347]  Now how's that for acceptance?
[02:05:51.347 --> 02:05:54.609]  You can read both articles now on InfoWars.com.
[02:05:54.609 --> 02:05:57.790]  Roger reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:06:04.574 --> 02:06:07.436]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:06:07.436 --> 02:06:09.417]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:06:09.417 --> 02:06:14.440]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:16.522]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:06:16.522 --> 02:06:17.823]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:06:17.823 --> 02:06:22.926]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:06:22.926 --> 02:06:26.308]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:06:26.448 --> 02:06:29.809]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:06:29.809 --> 02:06:32.791]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:06:32.791 --> 02:06:36.492]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:06:36.492 --> 02:06:43.395]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:06:43.395 --> 02:06:50.918]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[02:07:15.209 --> 02:07:23.151]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.

[02:08:07.873 --> 02:08:17.359]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.359 --> 02:08:20.001]  All right, Michael Malice is our guest for the next 40 minutes or so.
[02:08:20.001 --> 02:08:27.686]  Then I've got other news I want to get to dealing with the economy, war, the building threats to overthrow the president.
[02:08:27.686 --> 02:08:34.870]  You have the Democrats losing four special elections that they spent more money on than any other elections previous.
[02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:35.571]  That's all admitted.
[02:08:36.570 --> 02:08:42.074]  You've got investigative journalists, I say that in quotes, crawling all over InfoWars.
[02:08:42.074 --> 02:08:50.859]  You've got Megyn Kelly's fake piece she did, which even mainline liberals say that blew up in her face, and the worst ratings ever recorded on Dateline, 3.5 million viewers.
[02:08:50.859 --> 02:08:54.302]  Used to have 10 million, when she took over, 7 million.
[02:08:54.302 --> 02:08:56.023]  That was just a month ago.
[02:08:56.023 --> 02:08:58.104]  So this is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:08:58.104 --> 02:09:02.147]  But I notice their main attack is that we fund ourselves at InfoWars.
[02:09:02.147 --> 02:09:02.407]  Why?
[02:09:02.407 --> 02:09:03.268]  We make money.
[02:09:04.454 --> 02:09:09.947]  Why, we sell t-shirts, and we sell books, and we sell water filters, and they make fun of all that.
[02:09:09.947 --> 02:09:13.916]  We go out and find the very best water filters, the very best books, documentaries, and we sell them!
[02:09:14.787 --> 02:09:18.730]  You've got the Good American about the NSA spying with William Binney on DVD.
[02:09:18.730 --> 02:09:19.751]  How horrible!
[02:09:19.751 --> 02:09:35.484]  And now they've been saying, ooh, we sell toiletries, non-GMO, organic shampoo and body wash and non-nano zinc oxide sunscreen and healthy organic anti-bug spray with Emery's Essentials.
[02:09:35.484 --> 02:09:43.230]  They're going to call it, you know, snake poo or snake shield because I'm not allowed to sell anything.
[02:09:43.230 --> 02:09:43.891]  Anything either is evil.
[02:09:47.335 --> 02:09:49.257]  And they want to shut down our funding.
[02:09:49.257 --> 02:09:55.683]  So, they have been constantly filing complaints, the liberal media, with the Food and Drug Administration.
[02:09:55.683 --> 02:10:04.372]  They have been constantly doing articles in every major publication you can imagine, from Newsweek, to Time, to The New Yorker Magazine, to just everything.
[02:10:05.072 --> 02:10:21.716]  About how we sell Super Mel Vitality, that by the way is a private labeled product that's been out for over a decade, that's sold at Whole Foods, and that is known concentrated herbs that, for whatever reasons, have been known for thousands of years to boost vitality, energy, certainly works with my libido, okay?
[02:10:21.716 --> 02:10:25.157]  But the point is, Jeff Bezos now owns Whole Foods.
[02:10:25.157 --> 02:10:29.838]  He is the biggest seller in the world of Super Mel Vitality and products like it.
[02:10:30.518 --> 02:10:35.522]  And you got, one thing the liberals do know about, it's herbs and vitamins and stuff, I mean it really works, it's great stuff.
[02:10:35.522 --> 02:10:38.164]  It's the fastest growing industry left in this country.
[02:10:38.164 --> 02:10:47.211]  And we've, everything we sell is what they call grass, and that's law back in the 90s, meaning the FDA says this, you know, we see this as safe.
[02:10:47.211 --> 02:10:55.078]  We have top lawyers that have worked for the FDA, two of them, that certify all our labels and certify what we say about it, to just be above
[02:10:56.541 --> 02:11:07.706]  I mean, DNA Force has the true organic sourced Bio-PQ-Q that we buy from Mishimishi America, and it's the only one out there that you can say is actually that.
[02:11:07.706 --> 02:11:09.547]  It's a drug in Japan.
[02:11:09.547 --> 02:11:10.787]  Bio-PQ-Q, folks.
[02:11:10.787 --> 02:11:11.668]  CoQ10.
[02:11:11.668 --> 02:11:14.369]  There's no debate about how good this stuff is.
[02:11:14.369 --> 02:11:16.230]  It's like vitamin C. It's sold out!
[02:11:16.230 --> 02:11:19.371]  It's so good, and it has to all be lab tested.
[02:11:19.371 --> 02:11:23.013]  We're sold out of it half the time, because we follow California standards.
[02:11:23.013 --> 02:11:25.294]  There's more lead in the air than can be in our products.
[02:11:26.072 --> 02:11:30.415]  We go to crazy level, and that's what they can't stand.
[02:11:30.415 --> 02:11:40.242]  Because the complaints and the crap that's been filed and the rest of it has just... They went to Power Reviews, one of the biggest third-party review sites, and said there's no way he has 50,000 plus reviews and the average is 4.7.
[02:11:40.242 --> 02:11:41.943]  No one else has that.
[02:11:41.943 --> 02:11:44.004]  Power Reviews said, yeah, here's all the data.
[02:11:44.004 --> 02:11:44.905]  Said, you're an idiot.
[02:11:44.905 --> 02:11:46.566]  We cut out the stuff that's too good.
[02:11:48.203 --> 02:11:54.888]  Because I went and partnered with four of the biggest organic manufacturers in the country that are the producers.
[02:11:54.888 --> 02:11:58.691]  Our toothpaste is made by the folks that make Tom's from Maine, the top seller.
[02:11:58.691 --> 02:12:02.714]  I go out and find the best companies, then I have other stuff added to it.
[02:12:02.714 --> 02:12:04.556]  Folks want Iodine and colloidal silver.
[02:12:04.556 --> 02:12:07.418]  I add that to it, and then it becomes a super mega seller.
[02:12:07.418 --> 02:12:10.580]  Wow, I did market research, plus I personally use it.
[02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:13.582]  Wow, I'm so evil!
[02:12:13.582 --> 02:12:13.743]  So,
[02:12:14.744 --> 02:12:29.089]  They have a huge article, this is Atlantic, and then I'm going to my guest, this is Atlantic Monthly, that is the liberal mouthpiece, even more than the New York Times, where they just wrote, we want to overthrow Trump, we want to disallow the whole election of the Republicans, kick them all out.
[02:12:29.089 --> 02:12:30.450]  Sean Hannity covers it.
[02:12:30.450 --> 02:12:34.331]  They go, oh Sean Hannity's insane, he got it from Jones, Washington Post yesterday.
[02:12:34.331 --> 02:12:36.532]  Sean Hannity's now in Alex Jones territory.
[02:12:36.532 --> 02:12:39.393]  Well the same people now have testosterone wars.
[02:12:40.831 --> 02:12:44.652]  And they go on to say, we tried to call, but no one would defend their product.
[02:12:44.652 --> 02:12:46.973]  And they sent us to the whistleblower email.
[02:12:46.973 --> 02:12:49.773]  What'd they call, like our answering service at midnight?
[02:12:49.773 --> 02:12:52.014]  Everybody knows we have media and info wars.
[02:12:52.014 --> 02:12:53.914]  You know how to contact us, you liars.
[02:12:53.914 --> 02:12:55.775]  There's a big link on the front page of the site.
[02:12:55.775 --> 02:12:58.075]  So it's all about, we're hiding.
[02:12:58.075 --> 02:13:00.256]  We won't tell you what we're up to.
[02:13:00.256 --> 02:13:01.796]  Let me show you another example of this.
[02:13:01.796 --> 02:13:04.277]  This is in the New York Daily News.
[02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:06.142]  There's a trick.
[02:13:06.142 --> 02:13:08.468]  There's lots of letters to the editor that get sent in.
[02:13:08.468 --> 02:13:11.235]  And every day I'll see some shocking headline.
[02:13:11.235 --> 02:13:12.057]  Some shocking headline.
[02:13:12.057 --> 02:13:12.879]  Then I'm done going to our guest.
[02:13:15.086 --> 02:13:21.549]  On a Google search, they'll say something horrible like, Alex Jones is a murderer, Alex Jones is a child molester, Alex Jones robs banks.
[02:13:21.549 --> 02:13:24.610]  And I go, look, that's how they get me.
[02:13:24.610 --> 02:13:32.134]  They'll take letters to the editor saying nice things, and they'll put it next to other letters in the headline, toward knowing most people only read the headlines.
[02:13:32.134 --> 02:13:41.558]  Here it is, you see a headline with Tom Hanks in it, it draws your attention, you read it, and it says, June 20th, celebrities, Alex Jones, and sexual abuse.
[02:13:41.558 --> 02:13:43.019]  And I go, gee, let me read that.
[02:13:45.342 --> 02:13:46.563]  And here's the letter to the editor.
[02:13:46.563 --> 02:13:48.904]  It's like the second one down.
[02:13:48.904 --> 02:13:50.664]  Keeping up with Jones.
[02:13:50.664 --> 02:13:55.567]  So it's something nice the person said about me, but in the headline, it's not even subliminal.
[02:13:55.567 --> 02:13:57.087]  It's above subliminal.
[02:13:57.087 --> 02:13:58.388]  Alex Jones and sexual abuse.
[02:13:59.537 --> 02:14:00.097]  Isn't that nice?
[02:14:00.097 --> 02:14:00.918]  Here it is.
[02:14:00.918 --> 02:14:02.018]  Morgan Hill, California.
[02:14:02.018 --> 02:14:05.079]  I was a longtime Democrat, a Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders supporter.
[02:14:05.079 --> 02:14:09.200]  I watched Alex Jones, Nutwork News, there's an article, June 13th.
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:12.342]  I'm not an uneducated racist or a nut.
[02:14:12.342 --> 02:14:13.622]  I am a retired teacher.
[02:14:13.622 --> 02:14:15.543]  My family and friends watch him too.
[02:14:15.543 --> 02:14:18.644]  They are hardworking, patriotic, dentists, cops, military veterans, and educators.
[02:14:19.244 --> 02:14:22.026]  I think your horrible depiction of Jones is untrue.
[02:14:22.026 --> 02:14:28.612]  He loves all people and wants everyone to have a better life, and he is the only one who predicted Donald Trump winning.
[02:14:28.612 --> 02:14:31.174]  I refuse to watch the mainstream media anymore.
[02:14:31.174 --> 02:14:33.996]  The most hilarious thing is no one understands us.
[02:14:33.996 --> 02:14:37.579]  We are revolting against lies and corporate media.
[02:14:37.579 --> 02:14:43.764]  Eden Perry, in Morgan Hill, California, who saw some hit piece video they did on me.
[02:14:45.708 --> 02:14:46.490]  Here's the deal.
[02:14:46.490 --> 02:14:53.143]  We sell like 40 products of vitamin, mineral, amino acid, fruit punch for your kids.
[02:14:54.721 --> 02:15:01.503]  We've got Child Ease, that's a top-labeled, 30-year, top-selling product in the country for children from a top brand name.
[02:15:01.503 --> 02:15:09.526]  Emerix Essentials is the number three biggest organic shampoo toiletry line in the country, but private-labeled to my middle name, 20% off.
[02:15:09.526 --> 02:15:10.926]  That's bad, too?
[02:15:10.926 --> 02:15:12.987]  I mean, Bezos can sell whatever he wants.
[02:15:12.987 --> 02:15:16.648]  Bad supplements, good supplements, stuff that's not FDA- you know, none of that stuff.
[02:15:17.108 --> 02:15:22.774]  But me, I bring you the very best to help fund her operation and they are so pissed.
[02:15:22.774 --> 02:15:27.558]  Because if anybody else, don't worry guys, I can fund this with t-shirts, I can fund this with water filters.
[02:15:27.558 --> 02:15:27.818]  In fact...
[02:15:29.079 --> 02:15:29.899]  It goes in cycles.
[02:15:29.899 --> 02:15:31.900]  We're about to get back into big pushing.
[02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:33.041]  Oh, that's bad, too.
[02:15:33.041 --> 02:15:34.301]  Drink the water, folks.
[02:15:34.301 --> 02:15:37.042]  Drink the best phenol A. Drink it all.
[02:15:37.042 --> 02:15:42.365]  So, tyrants always use economic control to dominate people.
[02:15:42.365 --> 02:15:52.789]  So let these tyrants know you're aware of their activities and get some of the high-quality products, free shipping right now and massive discounts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:15:52.789 --> 02:15:55.530]  But they are out to get us.
[02:15:55.530 --> 02:15:57.891]  I mean, they report this like we're criminals.
[02:16:00.822 --> 02:16:04.426]  And then they lie and say that I'm countering the gay bomb with my product.
[02:16:04.426 --> 02:16:11.753]  That was a BBC headline about a gay bomb, chemicals they were going to spray on the Iraqis that basically make you have sex with a fence post.
[02:16:11.753 --> 02:16:13.075]  But again, they don't think you'll act.
[02:16:13.075 --> 02:16:16.698]  A vast article saying I'm a liar about lizard penis raids.
[02:16:16.698 --> 02:16:19.701]  That was associated press about the lizard penises.
[02:16:19.701 --> 02:16:21.904]  But it sounds crazy, so they take it out of context.
[02:16:22.881 --> 02:16:26.145]  Yes, they're shipping in smuggled monitored lizard penises.
[02:16:26.145 --> 02:16:28.267]  There it is, scientists developed gay bomb.
[02:16:28.267 --> 02:16:28.968]  The Daily Mail.
[02:16:28.968 --> 02:16:31.330]  I'm not the one making this up!
[02:16:31.330 --> 02:16:32.191]  This is going on.
[02:16:32.191 --> 02:16:34.273]  Okay, I'm going to shut up for the rest of the time.
[02:16:34.273 --> 02:16:36.576]  I appreciate our guest joining us.
[02:16:36.576 --> 02:16:40.159]  His book is Dear Leader, speaking of economic control and slavery.
[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:50.290]  The unauthorized biography of Kim Jong-un, the son of Kim Jong-il, who again is the third-generation hereditary dictator of the communist hellhole.
[02:16:50.290 --> 02:16:55.435]  I think you should give it to all your liberal friends so they can learn about the wonders of this.
[02:16:55.435 --> 02:16:59.739]  But we just saw Mr. Warmbier die of injuries to stay in there.
[02:16:59.739 --> 02:17:03.142]  But the democracy of North Korea, as they call it, they claim
[02:17:04.624 --> 02:17:05.204]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:17:05.204 --> 02:17:07.445]  I have nothing to say about lizard penis, unfortunately.
[02:17:07.445 --> 02:17:08.105]  I can't speak on that.
[02:17:08.105 --> 02:17:09.185]  Well, it was in the AP.
[02:17:09.185 --> 02:17:09.766]  Did you see it?
[02:17:22.133 --> 02:17:24.474]  Yeah, they're like smuggling it in.
[02:17:24.474 --> 02:17:31.779]  People see it as a drug and so there was a big SWAT team raid over it and I reported it and just people think I'm making that up.
[02:17:31.779 --> 02:17:37.963]  What I want as a supplement is to teach me how to have a better voice like yours because I think I'm too high and I want a little more.
[02:17:37.963 --> 02:17:38.663]  No, you don't want one.
[02:17:38.663 --> 02:17:40.144]  My voice is shot is what's happened.
[02:17:42.569 --> 02:17:45.472]  We've got a few minutes to break, but I want you to have the floor here.
[02:17:45.472 --> 02:17:46.733]  Tell us about the Dear Leader.
[02:17:46.733 --> 02:17:50.056]  What is the essence of North Korea and our Dear Leader?
[02:17:50.056 --> 02:17:57.223]  North Korea practices what they preach, by which I mean they think human life does not matter except as a function of the government.
[02:17:57.223 --> 02:18:00.306]  Your entire life has to be at the leader's behest.
[02:18:00.306 --> 02:18:05.992]  They explicitly say the leader gives the citizens sociopolitical life, so human beings don't matter.
[02:18:06.392 --> 02:18:18.802]  So you see this not only with Otto Warmbier, who was a very tragic story and was very clearly a murderer, but you saw this in the 90s when they allowed 1 to 2 million of their own population to starve rather than let the government lose their control of power.
[02:18:18.802 --> 02:18:27.790]  So these people are, you know, we're blessed in this country because I think a lot of people, I was born in the Soviet Union, a lot of people don't realize how bad governments can be.
[02:18:27.790 --> 02:18:31.473]  They think it's income taxes or they think it's, you know, something like Bloomberg stuff.
[02:18:31.873 --> 02:18:32.573]  It's not.
[02:18:32.573 --> 02:18:37.915]  It can get so bad, and we're so used to it being so good here that we get oblivious.
[02:18:37.915 --> 02:18:42.476]  You know, being born in the Soviet Union, we had the KGB, and now we have the NSA.
[02:18:42.476 --> 02:18:43.316]  What's the difference?
[02:18:43.316 --> 02:18:44.456]  It's the same exact thing.
[02:18:44.456 --> 02:18:49.618]  When you were in Russia, people would listen to your phone calls and read your mail, and now we brought it in, and it's the Republicans who did it.
[02:18:49.618 --> 02:18:53.359]  So it's just really, really sad to see what's happening in this country in many ways.
[02:18:53.359 --> 02:18:57.240]  And to be clear, he's a dear leader, but your book is Dear Reader.
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:18:57.720]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:18:58.921]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:58.921 --> 02:18:59.602]  Well, right.
[02:18:59.602 --> 02:19:06.151]  So, I mean, North Korea is really, if people want to understand just how bad government can be, this is the South.
[02:19:06.151 --> 02:19:08.255]  It's been 70 years with this country and it's poor people.
[02:19:10.669 --> 02:19:13.291]  Is North Korea the most evil country on Earth?
[02:19:13.291 --> 02:19:14.672]  Without a question of a doubt.
[02:19:14.672 --> 02:19:16.093]  They have concentration camps.
[02:19:16.093 --> 02:19:18.976]  You can see the concentration camps on Google Earth.
[02:19:18.976 --> 02:19:21.378]  There's 100, 200,000 people in them right now.
[02:19:21.378 --> 02:19:27.382]  And another, I mean, I know after the break we're going to talk at length, but there's levels of hell that we can't even imagine.
[02:19:27.382 --> 02:19:34.268]  So whenever you see the media reporting on how funny they are, this is a country of hostages where everyone has a gun to the back of their head at all times.
[02:19:34.628 --> 02:19:41.214]  And if someone put a gun to the back of your head, Alex, or mine, you would do some wacky stuff, too, just to keep yourself and your family alive.
[02:19:41.214 --> 02:19:44.057]  That's right, like crying for three days when the dear leader dies.
[02:19:44.057 --> 02:19:44.857]  Yes!
[02:19:44.857 --> 02:19:48.841]  Michael Mao is expert on the Democratic Republic of North Korea.
[02:19:48.841 --> 02:19:51.423]  It's as democratic as our Democratic Party.
[02:19:51.423 --> 02:19:52.024]  It wants war.
[02:19:52.024 --> 02:19:52.624]  It wants death.
[02:19:52.624 --> 02:19:53.565]  It wants slaves.
[02:19:53.565 --> 02:19:57.729]  It wants total control as the priest of power stomping on a human face forever.
[02:19:59.574 --> 02:20:04.035]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[02:20:04.035 --> 02:20:11.998]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[02:20:11.998 --> 02:20:15.019]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[02:20:15.019 --> 02:20:19.020]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[02:20:19.020 --> 02:20:21.681]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[02:20:21.681 --> 02:20:25.362]  It's by using the amazing Home Freeze Dryer from Harvest Right.
[02:20:26.042 --> 02:20:30.047]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[02:20:30.047 --> 02:20:35.274]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[02:20:35.274 --> 02:20:41.102]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting food on hand.
[02:20:41.102 --> 02:20:43.925]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[02:20:44.426 --> 02:20:46.149]  We love our freeze dryer.

[02:21:02.016 --> 02:21:10.057]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[02:21:10.057 --> 02:21:11.978]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[02:21:28.821 --> 02:21:32.845]  Nearly one third of FBI domestic terrorism cases involve refugees.
[02:21:32.845 --> 02:21:33.925]  One third.
[02:21:33.925 --> 02:21:35.947]  There's already been riots across Europe.
[02:21:35.947 --> 02:21:37.148]  Is America next?
[02:21:37.148 --> 02:21:39.450]  Hi, I'm the owner of Infidel Body Armor.

[02:22:27.887 --> 02:22:30.729]  Many books have been written regarding the Law of Attraction.
[02:22:30.729 --> 02:22:37.234]  But what if all these books are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this law in our lives?
[02:22:37.234 --> 02:22:47.621]  The new book, It's Time to Align, the most powerful self-help book ever written by Alan Lautinger, takes a look at how the Law of Attraction really works and how it is being suppressed in our lives.
[02:22:47.621 --> 02:22:53.305]  Learn how to overcome this manipulation and how to experience alignment with the creative power of the universe.
[02:22:53.305 --> 02:22:56.788]  Get the new book, It's Time to Align, available at Amazon.com.
[02:22:58.007 --> 02:22:59.969]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:22:59.969 --> 02:23:05.293]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:23:05.293 --> 02:23:06.875]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:23:06.875 --> 02:23:15.222]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:23:15.222 --> 02:23:20.927]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:23:21.087 --> 02:23:22.909]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:23:22.909 --> 02:23:25.072]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:23:25.072 --> 02:23:29.578]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:23:29.578 --> 02:23:31.780]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:23:31.780 --> 02:23:39.630]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:23:39.650 --> 02:23:40.650]  Michael Malice is our guest.
[02:23:40.650 --> 02:23:41.970]  I don't know where to begin.
[02:23:41.970 --> 02:23:43.051]  He's the expert on
[02:24:08.226 --> 02:24:12.950]  North Korea written the unauthorized biography that's been hailed a dear reader about the dear leader.
[02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:23.878]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up to flesh this out, but what about the left celebrating Mao, celebrating North Korea, celebrating China, celebrating the most oppressive forms of this?
[02:24:24.919 --> 02:24:37.147]  Rallies just last weekend in Austin with communists with their AK-47s out, semi-autos, saying they want to kill everybody, and then saying they want to be like North Korea, they want to be like China.
[02:24:37.147 --> 02:24:40.029]  It's just the most ridiculous joke ever.
[02:24:40.029 --> 02:24:43.451]  It's like saying they want to go to hell instead of Valhalla.
[02:24:43.451 --> 02:24:47.434]  What is it like for you to be an expert on this and then see the left in love with this?
[02:24:48.308 --> 02:24:53.050]  Well, I'm a kind-hearted guy, despite my name, and I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.
[02:24:53.050 --> 02:25:00.734]  And I genuinely think, for the most part, once people understand what North Korea is really like, they will realize this is complete hell on earth, like you said.
[02:25:00.734 --> 02:25:03.216]  This is not aspirational for anyone.
[02:25:03.216 --> 02:25:07.478]  And that's the reason I wrote the book, because the media gets it wrong so often.
[02:25:07.478 --> 02:25:13.901]  They like to portray North Korea as this carnival, as a sideshow, as this wacky kind of country, where everyone gets along and everything's nice.
[02:25:13.901 --> 02:25:17.003]  And I'm like... Yeah, they only show the parades and things and say, look at these funny people.
[02:25:17.804 --> 02:25:18.805]  It's like Disney World, right?
[02:25:18.805 --> 02:25:20.707]  Like, hey, who doesn't like a parade, right, Alex?
[02:25:20.707 --> 02:25:22.409]  Like, hey, parades all day.
[02:25:22.409 --> 02:25:23.690]  It's not parades all day.
[02:25:23.690 --> 02:25:26.794]  These are, you know, like the baton death march.
[02:25:26.794 --> 02:25:30.418]  So I said, the books out there were either too depressing or too scholarly.
[02:25:30.418 --> 02:25:32.541]  I said, there's got to be a book where you can read
[02:25:33.061 --> 02:25:41.943]  And in an entertaining way, understand what is going on there and understand behind this facade of, you know, having a good time and it's this, you know, military superpower.
[02:25:41.943 --> 02:25:45.444]  They're really the worst place on earth and it didn't happen overnight.
[02:25:45.444 --> 02:25:50.545]  It took 70 years for this family, the Kim family, to build the walls that are oppressing these people.
[02:25:50.545 --> 02:25:53.526]  And I love how the leadership's all fat and everybody else is starving to death.
[02:25:53.526 --> 02:25:54.366]  It's so archetypal.
[02:25:55.277 --> 02:25:56.658]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:25:56.658 --> 02:26:02.502]  And it's like, again, they choose who gets food based on their loyalty to the regime.
[02:26:02.502 --> 02:26:04.283]  We can get into that system after the break.
[02:26:04.283 --> 02:26:05.364]  I don't have much time.
[02:26:05.364 --> 02:26:08.887]  But yeah, there's so many levels to how they control the people.
[02:26:08.887 --> 02:26:10.248]  It's not just the telephones.
[02:26:10.248 --> 02:26:11.368]  It's not just the television.
[02:26:11.368 --> 02:26:13.210]  It's not just the education system.
[02:26:13.210 --> 02:26:18.974]  It's just so stacked and so covered that it seems your heart just has to break for the North Korean people.
[02:26:19.674 --> 02:26:20.515]  My heart does break.
[02:26:20.515 --> 02:26:22.637]  You know, my sister's Korean, adopted.
[02:26:22.637 --> 02:26:25.039]  She was, you know, the South is a lot better.
[02:26:25.039 --> 02:26:26.240]  The North has its own problems.
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:32.846]  If somebody is born out of wedlock, it's seen as a ghost child, basically thrown on the side of the road, starved to death.
[02:26:32.846 --> 02:26:37.291]  And so, I mean, I have a connection to Korea and I've talked to families from the military over there.
[02:26:37.711 --> 02:26:45.315]  But they talk about the North, where the entertainment is torturing and raping people and killing people's children in front of them, and the forced labor camps.
[02:26:45.315 --> 02:26:50.377]  And you look at the demonic look in the soldiers' eyes, I see the same look in the Democrats' eyes.
[02:26:50.377 --> 02:26:51.158]  I'm not kidding.
[02:26:51.158 --> 02:26:53.499]  For them, it's about dominating other people.
[02:26:54.864 --> 02:27:01.374]  I can't go as far as that because if I had to choose between Hillary Clinton and Kim Jong-un, this would not be a hard choice.
[02:27:01.374 --> 02:27:07.463]  But I think a lot of times when people have the wrong convictions, it becomes a slippery slope and that's the real concern.
[02:27:09.645 --> 02:27:09.925]  I don't know.
[02:27:09.925 --> 02:27:16.592]  If you look at the evil eyes of Hillary in stealing 97% of the Haitian money and all the bad things she's been involved in, I think she's a Kim Jong-un.
[02:27:16.592 --> 02:27:19.795]  I just think she can't get that much evil done here.
[02:27:19.795 --> 02:27:22.858]  Well, she's not that charismatic, so there's already one big difference, huh?
[02:27:22.858 --> 02:27:25.180]  And she couldn't win an election like he did.
[02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:25.660]  That's right.
[02:27:25.660 --> 02:27:28.623]  Oh yes, he has elections.
[02:27:28.623 --> 02:27:30.505]  You've got the greatest hits of this.
[02:27:30.505 --> 02:27:31.686]  Folks need to know.
[02:27:31.686 --> 02:27:34.569]  Let's start running through North Korea, what it really is and where it's going.
[02:27:35.307 --> 02:27:39.470]  Yeah, so I mean, let's talk about the levels of control that they have.
[02:27:39.470 --> 02:27:45.053]  So everyone in North Korea, everyone is slotted into some group, your school, your neighborhood, your office.
[02:27:45.053 --> 02:27:47.835]  And once a week, people ask, why don't they have a rebellion?
[02:27:47.835 --> 02:27:48.815]  Why don't they revolt?
[02:27:48.815 --> 02:27:56.440]  Well, once a week, you have to get together with your school or your office, your neighborhood, and you have to get up and say, this is what I did wrong this week.
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:27:59.162]  And then your peers have to get up and denounce you.
[02:27:59.742 --> 02:28:01.504]  So, and you better have something to say.
[02:28:01.504 --> 02:28:06.608]  So, everyone in the country is constantly spying on everyone else, and it's been this way since the 70s.
[02:28:06.608 --> 02:28:13.113]  Now, if you're looking for something to say about somebody else, and they start plotting against the government, well, that's the first thing you're going to report them on.
[02:28:13.113 --> 02:28:17.757]  So, right away, they have a mechanism to make sure people can't get together and collude against the government.
[02:28:17.757 --> 02:28:19.178]  So, that's something we can't allow.
[02:28:19.178 --> 02:28:25.063]  And that's just like modern political correctness, where everyone's guilty, and you must announce you're guilty, and you must say you're guilty to be accepted.
[02:28:25.774 --> 02:28:27.536]  Yes, that's exactly right.
[02:28:27.536 --> 02:28:38.505]  So another thing that they have is in the 50s, and there are several iterations over the decades, and I get into this in my book, they had something called the Understanding People Project.
[02:28:38.505 --> 02:28:44.771]  Now, Alex, you know perfectly well that these dictatorships always have nice sunshiny names to these horrible things that they do.
[02:28:44.771 --> 02:28:48.054]  It's never like concentration camp, it's like camp fun, right?
[02:28:48.054 --> 02:28:50.176]  So what is the Understanding People Project?
[02:28:50.176 --> 02:28:52.458]  They interviewed everyone in the country, everyone.
[02:28:53.038 --> 02:28:55.540]  And they asked them about the family background.
[02:28:55.540 --> 02:28:59.443]  There were good people, people who fought with the great leader Kim Il-sung, people who were communists.
[02:28:59.443 --> 02:29:00.244]  There were bad people.
[02:29:00.244 --> 02:29:01.985]  Did you have a priest in your family?
[02:29:01.985 --> 02:29:03.286]  Were you a landlord?
[02:29:03.286 --> 02:29:12.554]  Based on this, your family was assigned a sungbun score, which is like a credit score, and you're divided into the loyal caste, the wavering, or the hostile.
[02:29:12.554 --> 02:29:17.118]  And this determines everything about your life, where you live, whether you can go to college,
[02:29:17.518 --> 02:29:24.426]  So it's a total caste system, and then what your family background is if you're sent to a re-education camp, then that decides how much food you get, what jobs you have.
[02:29:39.005 --> 02:29:39.626]  Unbelievable.
[02:29:39.626 --> 02:29:43.629]  And this is what the left hails and thinks is cute and funny.
[02:29:43.629 --> 02:29:45.911]  And they also promote China and think it's cute and funny.
[02:29:45.911 --> 02:29:47.352]  An expert on North Korea is our guest.
[02:29:47.352 --> 02:29:48.493]  Stay with us.
[02:29:48.493 --> 02:29:49.894]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.894 --> 02:29:52.416]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.416 --> 02:29:55.098]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:05.424]  Donald Trump just held a rally in Iowa, and one of the people in attendance, our anonymous sources say, was Bill Clinton.
[02:30:05.424 --> 02:30:06.785]  Well, how do we know it was Bill Clinton?
[02:30:06.785 --> 02:30:17.052]  Because while Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise and the other three Americans who were shot at the ball field by a deranged Bernie supporter, Democratic operatives began blowing their Bill Clinton rape whistles.
[02:30:17.052 --> 02:30:22.575]  I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend.
[02:30:23.736 --> 02:30:26.298]  Somebody that I've gotten to know very well.
[02:30:26.298 --> 02:30:27.620]  Steve Scalise!
[02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:27.860]  Right?
[02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:33.885]  Because that's the only reason you would try to interrupt a president as he was sending out his thoughts and prayers to somebody who had recently been shot, right?
[02:30:33.885 --> 02:30:34.886]  Come on, work with me here.
[02:30:34.886 --> 02:30:37.087]  The Democrats can't even protest right.
[02:30:37.087 --> 02:30:38.289]  These people fail at everything.
[02:30:38.289 --> 02:30:42.612]  They lose elections, they lose public support, and now they look like thoughtless cowards.
[02:30:42.612 --> 02:30:43.593]  It's just as Trump said.
[02:30:43.593 --> 02:30:46.816]  Never fails.
[02:30:46.816 --> 02:30:47.136]  Never fails.
[02:30:47.850 --> 02:30:49.671]  You can check out the video on Infowars.com.
[02:30:49.671 --> 02:30:53.592]  Protesters blow whistles as Trump sends thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise.
[02:30:53.592 --> 02:30:55.193]  And that part about Beau Clinton being in the audience?
[02:30:55.193 --> 02:30:56.454]  That was fake news.
[02:30:56.454 --> 02:30:59.315]  Rob Dewey reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[02:30:59.315 --> 02:31:01.196]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:31:01.196 --> 02:31:03.237]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:31:03.237 --> 02:31:04.617]  It's the air we're breathing.
[02:31:04.617 --> 02:31:06.118]  Especially for our children.
[02:31:06.118 --> 02:31:08.679]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals.
[02:31:09.019 --> 02:31:12.180]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:12.180 --> 02:31:21.383]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:31:21.383 --> 02:31:28.905]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:28.905 --> 02:31:36.928]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:36.928 --> 02:31:37.908]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:39.122 --> 02:31:42.485]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:42.485 --> 02:31:46.629]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:46.629 --> 02:31:53.335]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:53.335 --> 02:31:57.459]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:10.127]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:32:10.127 --> 02:32:12.188]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:32:12.188 --> 02:32:15.050]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:32:15.050 --> 02:32:16.531]  It's made in the USA.
[02:32:16.531 --> 02:32:19.673]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[02:32:19.773 --> 02:32:23.356]  It's absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:32:23.356 --> 02:32:25.437]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:32:25.437 --> 02:32:35.145]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:32:35.145 --> 02:32:47.474]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[02:32:47.654 --> 02:32:51.961]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:32:51.961 --> 02:32:55.266]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:32:55.266 --> 02:32:58.471]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:33:17.299 --> 02:33:21.381]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:21.381 --> 02:33:26.024]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.024 --> 02:33:27.865]  The book is Dear Reader about the dear leader.
[02:33:27.865 --> 02:33:40.652]  I want to get him back for a full hour sometime to just go over the psychology of Kim Jong-un because he went to school in Switzerland and then he comes back and then his older brother runs off to go to Disney World and then they end up poisoning him.
[02:33:40.652 --> 02:33:42.273]  How do you live in Switzerland, beautiful?
[02:33:43.393 --> 02:33:49.637]  Tons of food, people being nice to you, and then go back and oppress your own people.
[02:33:49.637 --> 02:33:51.058]  So is he really in control?
[02:33:51.058 --> 02:33:52.259]  Is it China that's in control?
[02:33:52.259 --> 02:33:53.119]  Is it the military?
[02:33:53.119 --> 02:33:54.380]  You know, we hear a lot of stuff.
[02:33:54.380 --> 02:33:56.522]  The word is it's the military there.
[02:33:56.522 --> 02:33:57.903]  China's been trying to exert control.
[02:33:57.903 --> 02:33:59.504]  I'm not defending China.
[02:33:59.504 --> 02:34:00.704]  But we're going to get the expert.
[02:34:00.704 --> 02:34:08.249]  I mean, he's hailed as one of the top experts, best-selling author, ghostwrites a lot of the big, you know, top political books you see out there with Fox News hosts that have put out.
[02:34:08.249 --> 02:34:09.110]  Very prolific.
[02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:10.130]  Michael Malice.
[02:34:10.130 --> 02:34:11.812]  Follow him on Twitter, at Michael Malice.
[02:34:13.656 --> 02:34:15.579]  Going back to this just briefly.
[02:34:15.579 --> 02:34:16.500]  Testosterone Wars.
[02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:19.423]  I had a chance now to read this article fully because they gave it to me earlier.
[02:34:19.423 --> 02:34:21.005]  I only read part of it.
[02:34:21.005 --> 02:34:24.349]  They actually say we're bad selling vitamin B12, folks.
[02:34:24.349 --> 02:34:26.432]  Liquid methylcobalamin.
[02:34:26.432 --> 02:34:27.794]  The same type people inject.
[02:34:29.102 --> 02:34:33.866]  Under the tongue, you get better absorption rate than just swallowing it or taking a pill.
[02:34:33.866 --> 02:34:35.807]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:34:35.807 --> 02:34:37.188]  Whole Foods can sell it.
[02:34:37.188 --> 02:34:38.289]  Amazon can sell it.
[02:34:38.289 --> 02:34:39.350]  It works.
[02:34:39.350 --> 02:34:42.533]  My medical doctor, when I was 40, I went and got a checkup.
[02:34:42.533 --> 02:34:45.075]  And they said, you're pre-pre-diabetic.
[02:34:45.075 --> 02:34:46.596]  And you better lose some weight and blah, blah, blah.
[02:34:46.596 --> 02:34:48.437]  And he goes, by the way, vitamin B12 injections.
[02:34:48.437 --> 02:34:49.138]  Here, take this.
[02:34:49.138 --> 02:34:50.579]  And it really helped me.
[02:34:50.579 --> 02:34:54.282]  And then I went out to one of the top companies and we put out Secret 12.
[02:34:54.282 --> 02:34:54.582]  That is,
[02:34:55.987 --> 02:34:57.368]  Basically, pharmaceutical grade.
[02:34:57.368 --> 02:34:58.468]  I mean, don't inject it.
[02:34:58.468 --> 02:34:59.709]  Don't do that from a doctor.
[02:34:59.709 --> 02:35:00.509]  It is vitamin B12, 80%.
[02:35:00.509 --> 02:35:04.771]  The other 20% is this other vitamin B12 that helps it upload better.
[02:35:04.771 --> 02:35:08.873]  The point is, I mean, I get better energy off of it than a cup of coffee.
[02:35:08.873 --> 02:35:11.654]  And they're like, no one's really sure if vitamin B12's needed.
[02:35:11.654 --> 02:35:13.535]  You just die without it.
[02:35:13.535 --> 02:35:23.540]  And again, you have to understand, Supermail is a private label of the cold-pressed into an oil form
[02:35:25.001 --> 02:35:31.464]  Male stamina, energy, you name it, product.
[02:35:31.464 --> 02:35:34.025]  You understand that?
[02:35:34.025 --> 02:35:35.905]  Our colloidal silver is the one they sell in Whole Foods.
[02:35:35.905 --> 02:35:36.526]  We just sell it $5 lower.
[02:35:38.183 --> 02:35:39.383]  Again, our toothpaste.
[02:35:39.383 --> 02:35:41.144]  But they're even demonizing that I sell toothpaste.
[02:35:41.144 --> 02:35:42.684]  What next?
[02:35:42.684 --> 02:35:44.125]  Is toothpaste not needed?
[02:35:44.125 --> 02:35:45.865]  Is that okay with you?
[02:35:45.865 --> 02:35:47.006]  You're such hypocrites.
[02:35:47.006 --> 02:35:57.489]  The mainstream media has Prozac ads, and these ads where it says it can kill you, and irritable this, and restless leg that, and it'll cause heart attacks, and brain damage, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:35:57.489 --> 02:36:00.150]  Then they lie and say, oh, vaccines never hurt you.
[02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:01.110]  They've never had a side effect.
[02:36:01.110 --> 02:36:04.531]  Yeah, they just have a secret vaccine damage fund they pay out billions a year on.
[02:36:06.164 --> 02:36:10.265]  The vaccine insert says it can kill you deader than a hammer.
[02:36:10.265 --> 02:36:11.586]  But they're okay pushing that.
[02:36:11.586 --> 02:36:12.626]  No, no, I'm bad.
[02:36:12.626 --> 02:36:13.706]  Well, guess what?
[02:36:13.706 --> 02:36:17.227]  Super Male Vitality is 30% off, 4th of July special.
[02:36:17.227 --> 02:36:19.228]  Try it and just see what it does for you.
[02:36:19.228 --> 02:36:22.209]  There's a reason it's a bestseller.
[02:36:22.209 --> 02:36:26.430]  Rainforest Plus is just a bunch of known nootropics.
[02:36:26.430 --> 02:36:28.030]  There's a reason it's a bestseller.
[02:36:28.030 --> 02:36:29.691]  It is overall THE bestseller.
[02:36:30.606 --> 02:36:38.689]  We've got Survival Shield X2, Deep Earth, Iodine, just search engine, iodine deficiency, IQ.
[02:36:38.689 --> 02:36:40.509]  That's all you need to know.
[02:36:40.509 --> 02:36:44.951]  And most of the iodine in the environment is bound to not be absorbed.
[02:36:44.951 --> 02:36:45.731]  Emirates Essentials.
[02:36:45.731 --> 02:36:47.811]  Again, we got non-nano zinc.
[02:36:47.811 --> 02:36:52.533]  We copy the top brand in the country from the top brand that is kind enough to do that with us.
[02:36:52.533 --> 02:36:54.594]  So horrible, I'm selling sunscreens pretty soon.
[02:36:54.594 --> 02:36:57.494]  There's no proof sunscreens needed!
[02:36:57.494 --> 02:36:58.795]  Another conspiracy theory.
[02:37:00.216 --> 02:37:01.617]  Living Defense, check it out.
[02:37:01.617 --> 02:37:04.379]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:04.379 --> 02:37:07.421]  They're coming after us.
[02:37:07.421 --> 02:37:08.361]  We need your support.
[02:37:08.361 --> 02:37:09.762]  All right, back to our guest.
[02:37:09.762 --> 02:37:11.423]  I'm going to try to shut up, give him the floor.
[02:37:11.423 --> 02:37:18.948]  Give us the most important info about North Korea, where it's going, Kim Jong-un, what you think he's going to do, who's really in control.
[02:37:19.775 --> 02:37:21.937]  Kim Jong Un is unquestionably in control.
[02:37:21.937 --> 02:37:28.885]  So the leadership of the regime are people who are there not because of their intelligence or their skill, but because of their loyalty.
[02:37:28.885 --> 02:37:34.731]  As we talked before the break, since everyone is always spying everyone else, this weeds out disloyal people.
[02:37:35.251 --> 02:37:38.334]  And at the very top, you just get these absolute bootlickers.
[02:37:38.334 --> 02:37:40.836]  Which is good, because you don't want smart people at the top.
[02:37:40.836 --> 02:37:45.900]  You want people who don't know what they're doing, because that will give you a great chance to neutralize the regime.
[02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:47.581]  And they are starting to freak out.
[02:37:47.581 --> 02:37:51.304]  So North Korea, in many ways, is a religious culture.
[02:37:51.304 --> 02:37:53.426]  They've made a religion of Juche of their leaders.
[02:37:54.006 --> 02:37:59.151]  They idolize them and regard them as supernatural, and they have their own version of the Ten Commandments.
[02:37:59.151 --> 02:38:14.046]  And the Tenth Commandment says something like, What that means is, only a descendant of the founder of North Korea, the great leader Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Un's grandfather, can be a leader.
[02:38:14.426 --> 02:38:18.309]  So that's why Kim Jong Un killed his older brother Kim Jong Nam.
[02:38:18.309 --> 02:38:21.031]  Because if you take out his older brother, he's safe.
[02:38:21.031 --> 02:38:28.537]  You don't have a plan B. So this was very much an insurance policy and a demonstration that he's starting to get scared of his hold on power.
[02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:31.631]  Keep going, brother.
[02:38:48.985 --> 02:38:51.186]  Look, China has to defend a lot of their crap.
[02:38:51.186 --> 02:38:54.127]  They don't want an American ally on their border.
[02:38:54.127 --> 02:39:01.130]  They don't want 24 million North Korean refugees who don't speak Chinese crossing the Tumen River and setting up camp in Nigeria.
[02:39:01.130 --> 02:39:08.213]  At the same time, China is trying to pass itself as respectable, as decent on the world stage.
[02:39:08.213 --> 02:39:09.694]  It's impossible to defend
[02:39:10.094 --> 02:39:12.475]  They're now saying that Mr. Warmbier was never tortured in custody.
[02:39:32.219 --> 02:39:34.362]  I think that's plausible and here's why.
[02:39:34.362 --> 02:39:36.805]  I was in the same hotel as him.
[02:39:36.805 --> 02:39:38.588]  I stayed on the same floor.
[02:39:38.588 --> 02:39:39.769]  He was not a prisoner.
[02:39:39.769 --> 02:39:40.911]  He was a hostage.
[02:39:40.911 --> 02:39:49.222]  They've taken many Americans with some kind of pretense and held them as hostages and everyone who got out says they were treated well by North Korean standards.
[02:39:49.662 --> 02:39:52.124]  Treated well by North Korean standards, but still terribly.
[02:39:52.124 --> 02:39:54.465]  The doctors didn't find any signs of trauma in his body.
[02:39:54.465 --> 02:39:58.028]  If I had to guess, I would guess he was driven into self-harm.
[02:39:58.028 --> 02:40:04.852]  The point is, when you have a hostage, like any criminal, you want to make sure you can give that hostage back in exchange for your ransom.
[02:40:04.852 --> 02:40:08.074]  So the fact is, things obviously took a turn for the worse with him.
[02:40:08.074 --> 02:40:12.217]  And they're like, we got to get this body out of North Korea before we have a body in our hands.
[02:40:12.217 --> 02:40:13.998]  And that's exactly what happened, right?
[02:40:13.998 --> 02:40:16.520]  A week after he got back here, he was in a coffin.
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:20.470]  So that just tells you that they are not crazy, they are evil.
[02:40:20.470 --> 02:40:23.960]  They know what they're doing and that makes them even more reprehensible.
[02:40:25.376 --> 02:40:27.697]  Again, I'm just sitting back, because if I start talking, I won't stop.
[02:40:27.697 --> 02:40:42.505]  This is all riveting, just to get into the psychology of this place, and the fact that they've got more land mass than the South, but the South is probably the most productive country in the world, has an incredibly high standard of living, and then just north, everything looks wasted.
[02:40:42.505 --> 02:40:44.226]  I'm told there are hardly any bugs or birds.
[02:40:44.226 --> 02:40:45.566]  They've eaten everything.
[02:40:45.566 --> 02:40:48.448]  Why doesn't communism produce this wondrous heaven?
[02:40:48.448 --> 02:40:50.869]  Look at Venezuela's collapsing into Road Warrior right now.
[02:40:52.359 --> 02:40:56.361]  During the 90s when things really went bad for them, they even had polio return.
[02:40:56.361 --> 02:41:01.823]  The average height of a North Korean is four inches shorter than the genetically identical South Koreans.
[02:41:01.823 --> 02:41:06.064]  South Korea has the highest per capita at one point of all of Eastern Asia.
[02:41:06.064 --> 02:41:08.745]  North Korea has African level GDP.
[02:41:08.745 --> 02:41:16.648]  So it's take a lot of work for this evil family to take these proud people and destroy the entire country.
[02:41:16.648 --> 02:41:19.749]  And this did not happen overnight and it's not going to end overnight either.
[02:41:19.949 --> 02:41:25.793]  So this is like a vampire kingdom of a bunch of fat vampires running around torturing, raping, and murdering.
[02:41:25.793 --> 02:41:28.756]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:41:28.756 --> 02:41:37.922]  And then when you see things like Al Jazeera running articles about how cute the traffic girls are in the capital city of Pyongyang, it's like, can you be any more delusional?
[02:41:37.922 --> 02:41:39.243]  Can you have any less delusions?
[02:41:39.243 --> 02:41:41.345]  Why is there leftist defense of North Korea?
[02:41:41.345 --> 02:41:45.268]  I even see New York Times articles that kind of cutesy and say nice things about it.
[02:41:46.316 --> 02:41:50.178]  I can't even, Alex, God help me, I can't even begin to wrap my head around it.
[02:41:50.178 --> 02:42:01.542]  You know, again, being born in the Soviet Union, the idea that anyone can find anything kind of admirable about this country and what they're doing to the children, not having children have food.
[02:42:01.542 --> 02:42:04.043]  You can't even begin to wrap your head around that psychology.
[02:42:04.043 --> 02:42:07.485]  All you have to do is just get thee behind me, Satan, is my approach to that.
[02:42:07.485 --> 02:42:10.226]  And let's talk about how he likes to kill even members of his own family.
[02:42:11.542 --> 02:42:21.911]  Right, so when Kim Jong-un took over for his father in 2011, Kim Jong-il's sister, Kim Hyong-ui, was behind the scenes guiding things.
[02:42:21.911 --> 02:42:29.518]  Kim Hyong-ui is so wicked, she drove her own daughter to suicide because her daughter married someone of a lower social class, right?
[02:42:29.998 --> 02:42:33.982]  So when he took over, that was her husband that was killed.
[02:42:33.982 --> 02:42:38.787]  He was not killed by dogs, that's a myth, but look at how the corporate media gets it wrong.
[02:42:38.787 --> 02:42:44.352]  You know, you heard all those stories that he got his uncle eaten by dogs and it's like, look how crazy North Korea is, look how crazy North Korea is.
[02:42:44.352 --> 02:42:51.699]  It's not that someone was eaten by dogs, it's that someone who was like third in line of the government was executed overnight without cause.
[02:42:51.699 --> 02:42:52.900]  Can you imagine if, you know,
[02:42:53.621 --> 02:42:57.704]  President Trump had the Secretary of State executed out of nowhere.
[02:42:57.704 --> 02:42:59.165]  It would be psychotic.
[02:42:59.165 --> 02:43:00.366]  It would not make any sense.
[02:43:00.366 --> 02:43:05.510]  Yet that is the norm in this most evil of countries.
[02:43:05.510 --> 02:43:10.174]  Well, if people want to go down this rabbit hole, they can just search engine North Korean labor camps.
[02:43:10.174 --> 02:43:12.636]  But the sickest part is juxtaposing it.
[02:43:12.636 --> 02:43:16.959]  Kim Jong-un's women and all these women dressed in white all around him.
[02:43:16.959 --> 02:43:19.141]  And they're all manicured and dressed in Western style.
[02:43:19.141 --> 02:43:20.422]  They've all got Western apparel.
[02:43:20.982 --> 02:43:27.408]  And then you see, you know, people being, babies being eaten by rats or them telling families in forced labor, go ahead and eat your child.
[02:43:27.408 --> 02:43:29.270]  And then they do eat their child.
[02:43:29.270 --> 02:43:31.572]  And then you look at the eyes of the guards.
[02:43:31.572 --> 02:43:33.694]  It's like they're demon possessed.
[02:43:33.694 --> 02:43:35.376]  It's like they're jack-o'-lanterns.
[02:43:35.376 --> 02:43:38.819]  They are, it's like some evil spirit is feeding in North Korea.
[02:43:39.460 --> 02:43:44.642]  They are explicitly told, the guards are, enemies of the leader are not human beings.
[02:43:44.642 --> 02:43:49.243]  And there's one story in these labor camps when a woman was raped by the guards.
[02:43:49.243 --> 02:43:52.204]  Well, you're not allowed to have sex with the guards, so she was punished.
[02:43:52.204 --> 02:44:00.266]  They ran her over with a truck, amputated her legs, and then she had to push herself around on a tire to still fulfill her work quota.
[02:44:00.586 --> 02:44:02.389]  That is how reprehensible it is in the camps.
[02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:04.472]  Also, they have family punishment.
[02:44:04.472 --> 02:44:10.822]  So when your family goes to the camps, and let's suppose you kill yourself, your family has to fulfill your quota.
[02:44:10.822 --> 02:44:14.808]  So even death is not escape from the leadership of this horrific regime.
[02:44:16.451 --> 02:44:26.480]  And for those who don't know, they have restaurants in Denver and New York and London celebrating North Korea, celebrating China, and it's a form of sick cuckolding.
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:32.305]  It's like people in the lap of luxury, the lap of freedom, are almost like begging to open the gate of hell.
[02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:41.741]  Yeah, I mean, when you go there and you see these people, and what I did, being an obnoxious New Yorker, I would wave at everyone, get right in their face.
[02:44:41.741 --> 02:44:44.382]  Because when you do that to someone, the reaction is going to be sincere.
[02:44:44.382 --> 02:44:45.742]  They're going to be taken aback.
[02:44:45.742 --> 02:44:48.663]  And you'd see grandmas with their grandkids doting over them.
[02:44:48.663 --> 02:44:51.063]  Teenage girls would giggle and cover their mouths.
[02:44:51.063 --> 02:44:56.024]  You know, the teenage guys who thought they were too tough for school with their track suits would just stare at you and glare down.
[02:44:56.024 --> 02:44:57.704]  But their reactions were so normal.
[02:44:57.704 --> 02:45:01.285]  And you realize, communism can't turn people into robots.
[02:45:01.285 --> 02:45:02.185]  If they could, it would work.
[02:45:02.805 --> 02:45:09.875]  But so what you have is 24 million prisoners who are desperately trying to live normal lives in the most abnormal country on earth.
[02:45:09.875 --> 02:45:19.168]  And that's why I'm so honored that I get to talk about this to give people understanding and why I wrote my book so people can get this is not something to take lightly.
[02:45:19.889 --> 02:45:21.892]  This is what happens once you go into collectivism.
[02:45:21.892 --> 02:45:23.053]  Just evil rises.
[02:45:23.053 --> 02:45:24.415]  It's not about ingenuity.
[02:45:24.415 --> 02:45:25.457]  It's not about work.
[02:45:25.457 --> 02:45:27.180]  It's all just about barbarism.
[02:45:27.180 --> 02:45:29.383]  Michael Malish, you know, you've written a lot of best-selling books.
[02:45:29.383 --> 02:45:31.626]  They know how to Google your name.
[02:45:31.626 --> 02:45:34.971]  I mean, you can see satellite photos of only what two towns have power.
[02:45:36.093 --> 02:45:40.560]  And you see the South, it's all lit up like a Christmas tree, just to show the de-industrialization.
[02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:48.954]  But you've got gigantic huevos to go into a place where they routinely, as you know, kidnap and kill people.
[02:45:48.954 --> 02:45:49.655]  Why did you do this?
[02:45:50.874 --> 02:45:51.674]  Because I had to.
[02:45:51.674 --> 02:45:53.335]  Because someone had to do something about this.
[02:45:53.335 --> 02:45:59.776]  Because as a Jew, as a Russian, those were two chances for my family to have been taken to a camp in the middle of the night.
[02:45:59.776 --> 02:46:02.437]  And the biggest place where that's still the case on Earth is North Korea.
[02:46:02.437 --> 02:46:05.937]  And I said, by golly, I'm going to do something about this.
[02:46:05.937 --> 02:46:09.218]  Because after a while, as a writer, you want to give back and kind of make a difference.
[02:46:09.218 --> 02:46:16.380]  And if I'm moving the needle a little bit over there, that is a huge opportunity for positive change on this Earth.
[02:46:16.380 --> 02:46:18.160]  I'm just so ashamed of humanity
[02:46:19.460 --> 02:46:20.681]  I feel guilty for North Korea.
[02:46:20.681 --> 02:46:21.721]  I think that's what you just said.
[02:46:21.721 --> 02:46:24.183]  We're not like liberals here, like trying to find guilt.
[02:46:24.183 --> 02:46:29.786]  I just can't help but feel guilty when I've got this great life in this great country to see people living like this.
[02:46:29.786 --> 02:46:31.928]  And then I see people making jokes about it.
[02:46:31.928 --> 02:46:33.609]  I want to smack them in the face.
[02:46:33.609 --> 02:46:34.069]  Right.
[02:46:34.069 --> 02:46:38.692]  And what you also see a lot of times is these kind of some of these neocons who don't understand.
[02:46:38.692 --> 02:46:40.133]  They'd be like, they're threatening us.
[02:46:40.133 --> 02:46:41.554]  We should just bomb them to oblivion.
[02:46:42.054 --> 02:46:43.055]  Yeah, real tough guy.
[02:46:43.055 --> 02:46:45.257]  You're bombing 24 million slaves.
[02:46:45.257 --> 02:46:46.218]  That's the real moral of it.
[02:46:46.218 --> 02:46:47.580]  They have no internet, no TV.
[02:46:47.580 --> 02:46:49.041]  They believe the propaganda.
[02:46:49.041 --> 02:46:51.143]  The children are taken at birth in the lower caste.
[02:46:51.143 --> 02:46:52.044]  They don't know where they are.
[02:46:52.044 --> 02:46:56.669]  And they believe since the last war when over a million of them died in the North alone, that they're waiting for this.
[02:46:56.669 --> 02:47:00.573]  And they've got, what is it, 100,000 pieces of artillery aimed at Seoul?
[02:47:00.573 --> 02:47:02.075]  I mean, let's talk about war scenarios here.
[02:47:03.989 --> 02:47:05.930]  I mean, Alex, it's a nightmare scenario.
[02:47:05.930 --> 02:47:09.353]  You know, you hear in the press, it's like, what if they're going to nuke LA?
[02:47:09.353 --> 02:47:19.101]  Right now, even if they didn't have nukes, which they certainly do, right now, they can send so many missiles into Seoul, South Korea, population 10 million, just south of North Korea.
[02:47:19.101 --> 02:47:23.064]  I don't even want to imagine that visual of missiles hitting all these skyscrapers.
[02:47:23.064 --> 02:47:27.047]  It would be like the film Independence Day, but for real, the horrors of that are
[02:47:27.487 --> 02:47:28.608]  Unfathomable.
[02:47:28.608 --> 02:47:34.815]  And they boast explicitly that if we're going down, we're taking down as many people with us as we can.
[02:47:34.815 --> 02:47:41.842]  So people who are just like... Why don't Derelicts get with Kim Jong-un and say, let's work with the West, let's make a deal, bring wealth in.
[02:47:41.842 --> 02:47:44.024]  I just, I guess they just love the power and they're too cowardly.
[02:47:44.024 --> 02:47:46.266]  They're just, they're such pig demons.
[02:47:46.266 --> 02:47:47.968]  And look at these fat little demons.
[02:47:47.968 --> 02:47:48.528]  I just, you know.
[02:47:49.329 --> 02:47:50.389]  There's two reasons.
[02:47:50.389 --> 02:47:53.490]  Kim Jong-nam, the eldest brother, wanted to liberalize.
[02:47:53.490 --> 02:47:57.032]  And Kim Jong-il said, if you want openness, open a window.
[02:47:57.032 --> 02:47:59.232]  We're Korea, what worked for China will work for us.
[02:47:59.232 --> 02:48:02.454]  So that's one of the reasons why he was passed over for Kim Jong-un.
[02:48:02.454 --> 02:48:13.917]  But also, if you look at Romania, Iraq, Libya, and many other such dictatorships, when these regimes go down, the people at the top are personally tortured and murdered with good reason.
[02:48:13.917 --> 02:48:14.798]  That's right, like Ceaușescu.
[02:48:15.618 --> 02:48:16.278]  Yes!
[02:48:16.278 --> 02:48:22.081]  So if Kim Jong Un lost his control and power, certainly someone would and should put a bullet in him.
[02:48:22.081 --> 02:48:25.143]  So that's a big reason for him to do whatever he can to maintain that hold.
[02:48:26.889 --> 02:48:30.232]  Yeah, we should do a whole show sometime on the fall of Ceausescu.
[02:48:30.232 --> 02:48:34.415]  They had power for the whole country, but he only liked his little city in a city having it.
[02:48:34.415 --> 02:48:36.938]  So he turned everybody's power off at night time.
[02:48:36.938 --> 02:48:39.360]  I mean, he just, these people.
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:48.728]  And one of the greatest moments that you will ever see as someone who loves freedom, if you go on YouTube and look up Ceausescu's final speech, he would give speeches, everyone had to cheer or else, you know, they're going to get you.
[02:48:48.728 --> 02:48:52.351]  And this is the first time the audience in 40 years or something like that started booing him.
[02:48:52.651 --> 02:48:58.481]  And you see the look on his face when he turns and he realizes the jig is up and I think within a week later him and his evil wife were shot.
[02:48:59.605 --> 02:49:03.186]  That's because his own military was ready to kill him.
[02:49:03.186 --> 02:49:05.287]  Yeah, but Kim Jong-un, it's not the same way.
[02:49:05.287 --> 02:49:09.349]  They are loyal to the leader and that makes it even harder to imagine an endgame there.
[02:49:09.349 --> 02:49:10.109]  Well, I know this.
[02:49:10.109 --> 02:49:12.790]  I'm not looking for a war, but the left openly wants a civil war.
[02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:15.491]  I think we've already entered the first levels of it.
[02:49:15.491 --> 02:49:22.854]  From Johnny Depp to Madonna saying, kill the president, to Kathy Griffin, and I just, they're the most un-militaristic
[02:49:24.875 --> 02:49:28.638]  Wimps, trying to start a war with the ghost of George Washington.
[02:49:28.638 --> 02:49:32.200]  I feel sorry for them if they actually kick this thing off.
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:34.462]  Oh yeah, I mean, oh yeah.
[02:49:34.462 --> 02:49:36.443]  The other side has all the guns.
[02:49:36.443 --> 02:49:38.805]  You know, don't bring a decapitated head to a gunfight.
[02:49:38.805 --> 02:49:40.226]  You're not going to win, Kathy Griffin.
[02:49:41.894 --> 02:49:44.035]  So, is it a coming of age for the left?
[02:49:44.035 --> 02:49:47.077]  They say they're anti-violence, but they want it offensively?
[02:49:47.077 --> 02:49:49.198]  I mean, they're so pathetic and childlike.
[02:49:49.198 --> 02:49:53.040]  Why do you think they're just running around talking about murder and frothing at the mouth?
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:57.383]  Because I think when you start talking to each other and have an echo chamber, you have to try to outdo each other.
[02:49:57.383 --> 02:50:02.986]  You know how, like, in stand-up or improv, the first rule is, yes, and you have to build on the other person's joke, right?
[02:50:02.986 --> 02:50:09.409]  So they're trying to outdo each other and virtue signal to show their consent for the president to be like, well, I want him to be impeached.
[02:50:09.409 --> 02:50:09.689]  Oh, yeah?
[02:50:09.689 --> 02:50:10.690]  Well, I want him to be shot.
[02:50:11.190 --> 02:50:17.295]  And they don't realize how this comes off to even regular liberal people who might believe in a social state.
[02:50:17.295 --> 02:50:20.017]  Yeah, I want his supporters killed!
[02:50:20.017 --> 02:50:20.858]  Yeah, right.
[02:50:20.858 --> 02:50:25.881]  And that's why the moderates are going for Trump because it's like, listen, I disagree with the guy.
[02:50:25.881 --> 02:50:27.863]  I don't want you making fun of his son.
[02:50:27.863 --> 02:50:30.225]  I don't want you, you know, asking.
[02:50:30.225 --> 02:50:31.666]  It only makes you love Trump more.
[02:50:31.666 --> 02:50:35.829]  Michael Malice, the book, Dear Reader, available in bookstores everywhere.
[02:50:35.829 --> 02:50:36.430]  Michael Malice.
[02:50:36.430 --> 02:50:37.350]  Please don't get it on Amazon.
[02:50:37.350 --> 02:50:37.891]  He's a globalist.
[02:50:37.891 --> 02:50:40.713]  Get it somewhere else and support independent press in this country.
[02:50:40.993 --> 02:50:42.074]  Michael Malice, you're amazing.
[02:50:42.074 --> 02:50:43.495]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:50:43.495 --> 02:50:44.016]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:50:44.016 --> 02:50:44.976]  Great pleasure.
[02:50:44.976 --> 02:50:45.477]  Wow.
[02:50:45.477 --> 02:50:45.937]  Powerful.
[02:50:45.937 --> 02:50:51.882]  Okay, I got Joe Bix popping in because he knew Michael Hastings' wife when he was a Rolling Stones guy.
[02:50:51.882 --> 02:50:53.023]  His car blew up.
[02:50:53.023 --> 02:50:55.365]  She's the one going around saying Trump's a suicide bomber.
[02:50:55.365 --> 02:50:56.446]  So we're going to talk about her.

[02:54:09.063 --> 02:54:11.564]  No shackles on me.
[02:54:11.564 --> 02:54:13.504]  Don't want no shackles.
[02:54:13.504 --> 02:54:15.125]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[02:54:15.125 --> 02:54:16.985]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[02:54:16.985 --> 02:54:24.747]  You know, I like Jimmy Vaughn, just when he's playing regular blues with his guitar and somebody playing piano.
[02:54:24.747 --> 02:54:28.228]  That's a great guy.
[02:54:28.228 --> 02:54:36.290]  That Joe Beggs for two segments, he was able to pop in with us and Mike Cernovich is coming up because he texted me and pointed something out and he goes, I'm listening and I noticed you haven't put two and two together.
[02:54:37.557 --> 02:54:37.957]  Which is great.
[02:54:37.957 --> 02:54:40.318]  I don't want people to point out when I don't know something's going on.
[02:54:40.318 --> 02:54:42.620]  He goes, you recognize who that is?
[02:54:42.620 --> 02:54:45.121]  Saying that Trump is a suicide bomber.
[02:54:45.121 --> 02:54:46.702]  I said, no, who is she?
[02:54:46.702 --> 02:54:49.283]  He goes, that's Michael Hastings' wife.
[02:54:49.283 --> 02:54:50.483]  There's a reason to bring this back.
[02:54:50.483 --> 02:54:53.505]  Remember the guy that said, I found out the government's doing really horrible stuff.
[02:54:53.505 --> 02:54:55.206]  When it comes out, Obama's going down.
[02:54:55.206 --> 02:54:56.266]  He'd been a liberal.
[02:54:56.266 --> 02:54:58.167]  His car blows up going down the road.
[02:54:58.167 --> 02:55:01.489]  The engine shoots out like a hundred and something yards.
[02:55:01.489 --> 02:55:04.831]  His wife tells Big she thought it was dirty pool at his funeral.
[02:55:04.831 --> 02:55:05.391]  And she goes on,
[02:55:06.661 --> 02:55:10.422]  CNN says, oh everything's wonderful, oh no, just the car was driving fast.
[02:55:10.422 --> 02:55:12.843]  He was running for his life when that happened.
[02:55:12.843 --> 02:55:14.664]  So let's play that clip and get Joe Biden's take on it.
[02:55:14.664 --> 02:55:15.044]  Here she is.
[02:55:15.044 --> 02:55:19.906]  We're going to play the clip of her just coming out about Trump.
[02:55:19.906 --> 02:55:20.146]  Here it is.
[02:55:21.943 --> 02:55:22.663]  I said bluff.
[02:55:22.663 --> 02:55:24.384]  I said the President was bluffing.
[02:55:24.384 --> 02:55:26.485]  I may have been perhaps too fair.
[02:55:26.485 --> 02:55:31.487]  It would seem as if the President may have been lying all along about the existence of these tapes.
[02:55:31.487 --> 02:55:38.129]  No, he's just wasting, he wasted the country's collective time speculating over whether these tapes existed or not.
[02:55:38.129 --> 02:55:41.330]  It's a sad day when you cannot depend on the President's word.
[02:55:41.330 --> 02:55:46.812]  And my advice would just be to Republicans who do cozy up to him, it's just like hugging a suicide bomber.
[02:55:46.812 --> 02:55:48.573]  He blows you up in the process with him.
[02:55:49.233 --> 02:55:51.254]  It's like, that's a little strong, at least.
[02:55:51.254 --> 02:56:02.659]  Yeah, I mean, this is not, I mean, look at what, if you go out on a limb, if you're a Republican who went out on a limb and defended Donald Trump over saying, well, he's got tapes that are going to back up his point of view, you just got blown up, too.
[02:56:02.659 --> 02:56:03.599]  No, that's not what Trump said.
[02:56:03.599 --> 02:56:05.420]  He said, you better watch out.
[02:56:05.420 --> 02:56:13.283]  I might have tapes bluffing Comey into not lying and saying that the president tried to obstruct justice, which Comey says he didn't.
[02:56:14.525 --> 02:56:17.608]  So, and here's the deal.
[02:56:17.608 --> 02:56:22.913]  When Trump says, there might be tapes, somebody might have tapes, but I didn't tape it, Trump has tapes!
[02:56:22.913 --> 02:56:24.835]  You're in the President's office, you better believe it was taped.
[02:56:24.835 --> 02:56:26.056]  It's not by him.
[02:56:26.056 --> 02:56:27.858]  He's letting everybody know, okay?
[02:56:27.858 --> 02:56:29.539]  He tapes everything.
[02:56:29.539 --> 02:56:30.500]  Everything.
[02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:32.982]  Everything.
[02:56:32.982 --> 02:56:39.308]  I've never taped anybody, but, I mean, Megyn Kelly was coming on so hard on the phone, I was like, this is the biggest hit piece on earth.
[02:56:40.208 --> 02:56:42.871]  And I said, hold on one moment, I got the other phone started recording.
[02:56:42.871 --> 02:56:45.573]  I didn't even have a record app on my phone to record phone calls.
[02:56:45.573 --> 02:56:46.234]  I guess they have those.
[02:56:46.234 --> 02:56:47.955]  I had to get another phone and record it that way.
[02:56:47.955 --> 02:56:50.418]  They're like, oh, you're being so immoral taping her.
[02:56:50.418 --> 02:56:51.939]  She was coming on, man.
[02:56:51.939 --> 02:57:00.908]  You can hear it in what she said in the tape, how she's obsessed with me and wants to have dinner with me like I'm some idiot that even thinks she's attractive.
[02:57:01.949 --> 02:57:09.757]  Joe Biggs, you know the wife, the widow, and of course she was on the National Security Council herself as a top aide.
[02:57:09.757 --> 02:57:13.040]  Very, very interesting to have her up there saying this.
[02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:13.801]  What do you make of it, Joe?
[02:57:14.653 --> 02:57:15.473]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[02:57:15.473 --> 02:57:18.114]  It's the same kind of rhetoric we see from the left day in and day out.
[02:57:18.114 --> 02:57:22.275]  I mean, you have Johnny Depp coming out calling for an assassination of Trump.
[02:57:22.275 --> 02:57:23.675]  You've got Kathy Griffin.
[02:57:23.675 --> 02:57:25.475]  It just fits this entire narrative.
[02:57:25.475 --> 02:57:28.056]  And she's someone who used to work for Bush.
[02:57:28.056 --> 02:57:30.376]  You know, I was shocked more than anything.
[02:57:30.376 --> 02:57:35.957]  My buddy Josh Kaplan posted a video yesterday and I just saw her and I was immediately, I'm not going to lie, I was pretty triggered.
[02:57:35.957 --> 02:57:42.779]  Because I just don't, ever since what happened with the funeral and then how she turned her back on that, I've kind of been upset with her from the get-go.
[02:57:42.779 --> 02:57:43.759]  I just stopped talking to her.
[02:57:44.199 --> 02:57:46.660]  When I saw her face, I was like, God, I gotta watch this.
[02:57:46.660 --> 02:57:47.301]  What's gonna happen?
[02:57:47.301 --> 02:57:52.524]  And when she goes, Trump is like a suicide bomber, I'm like, are you kidding me?
[02:57:52.524 --> 02:57:56.186]  Like, this is the kind of rhetoric that leads to people being shot at.
[02:57:56.186 --> 02:58:06.031]  This is the type of stuff that fuels those basement dwellers who live at home with their mom and then finally come out of the shadows and try to pop off a few rounds at Republicans and have kill lists.
[02:58:06.371 --> 02:58:07.751]  That's adding to the fire.
[02:58:07.751 --> 02:58:08.452]  It's ridiculous.
[02:58:08.452 --> 02:58:12.833]  And they're running around saying hunt Republicans, and then they don't even apologize for it.
[02:58:12.833 --> 02:58:15.314]  What do you think their plan is, Joe?
[02:58:15.314 --> 02:58:17.014]  They want us to pop first.
[02:58:17.014 --> 02:58:23.416]  They want to provoke us to a point to where we pop off, and we're the ones who draw first blood, and that's what they're trying to do.
[02:58:23.416 --> 02:58:24.697]  But they keep drawing blood.
[02:58:24.697 --> 02:58:26.277]  They've attacked us time and time again.
[02:58:26.277 --> 02:58:26.777]  I agree.
[02:58:26.777 --> 02:58:29.098]  The thing is, though, is left media never covers that.
[02:58:29.098 --> 02:58:31.659]  Back in 70 seconds, we'll finish up, then Mike Sternum's is coming up.
[02:58:31.659 --> 02:58:32.399]  I want to ask Joe Biggs.
[02:58:33.979 --> 02:58:35.480]  Clearly they're behind the violence they wanted.
[02:58:35.480 --> 02:58:37.142]  Are they getting ready to stage a false flag?
[02:58:37.142 --> 02:58:39.064]  That'd be the perfect move right now.
[02:58:39.064 --> 02:58:40.225]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:40.225 --> 02:58:40.845]  Spread that link.
[02:58:40.845 --> 02:58:41.306]  They hate us.
[02:58:41.306 --> 02:58:42.587]  They're trying to shut us down.

[02:58:49.383 --> 02:58:55.924]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[02:58:55.924 --> 02:59:08.887]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:59:08.887 --> 02:59:12.548]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:59:12.548 --> 02:59:19.209]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family
[02:59:19.929 --> 02:59:32.395]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:59:32.395 --> 02:59:34.236]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:59:34.236 --> 02:59:40.618]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[02:59:51.924 --> 02:59:54.538]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:14.093 --> 03:00:15.893]  We are on the march.
[03:00:15.893 --> 03:00:19.034]  The empire is on the run.
[03:00:19.034 --> 03:00:23.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:23.695 --> 03:00:34.058]  Alright, I appreciate Joe Biggs popping in to talk about this lady popping off of the president being a suicide bomber, when just a month ago on the same network, their anti-terrorism expert said ISIS should hit Trump targets.
[03:00:34.058 --> 03:00:34.378]  It's like...
[03:00:35.216 --> 03:00:38.058]  You're actually on the news asking ISIS to coordinate attacks?
[03:00:38.058 --> 03:00:40.820]  I mean, and what's going to happen if somebody kills Trump?
[03:00:40.820 --> 03:00:50.227]  What's going to happen if somebody, or Johnny Depp, or CNN hosts saying, well, it's just political, he's not evil, shooting congressman Scalise and the cops.
[03:00:50.227 --> 03:00:51.848]  What happens when somebody shoots them?
[03:00:51.848 --> 03:00:53.970]  Are they going to then say, oh, it's just political?
[03:00:53.970 --> 03:00:57.072]  Again, they want to play the victim, but they're the ones on the attack.
[03:00:57.072 --> 03:00:58.893]  Why haven't they staged big false flags?
[03:01:00.393 --> 03:01:07.622]  What happens when a guy gets stabbed nine times coming out of a political rally in support of Donald Trump?
[03:01:07.622 --> 03:01:08.983]  You know, that's ridiculous.
[03:01:08.983 --> 03:01:10.886]  These guys are willing to take that extra step.
[03:01:10.886 --> 03:01:12.868]  They're willing to put blade in the flesh.
[03:01:12.868 --> 03:01:15.051]  They're willing to put bullets through flesh.
[03:01:15.051 --> 03:01:15.952]  And it's ridiculous.
[03:01:15.952 --> 03:01:16.873]  And he gets called.
[03:01:17.788 --> 03:01:20.791]  He gets called a white nationalist.
[03:01:20.791 --> 03:01:23.253]  He gets called a racist because he's a white guy.
[03:01:23.253 --> 03:01:26.316]  Oh yeah, the media says, punch a Nazi, stab a Nazi.
[03:01:26.316 --> 03:01:28.018]  So he's a white guy, he's a white nationalist.
[03:01:28.018 --> 03:01:31.401]  Now major feminist groups are saying, abort your baby if it's white.
[03:01:32.449 --> 03:01:33.469]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[03:01:33.469 --> 03:01:38.131]  I mean... No, white genocide's real, and it's being directed by liberal white people.
[03:01:38.131 --> 03:01:42.993]  I'm not giving the minorities a pass here, but I see people going, okay, white genocide, yeah, right.
[03:01:42.993 --> 03:01:45.614]  It's all over the news saying whites should all be killed.
[03:01:45.614 --> 03:01:47.515]  What in the hell is going on?
[03:01:47.995 --> 03:01:50.418]  You have to look at people like Tariq Nasheed.
[03:01:50.418 --> 03:01:54.782]  This guy is on Twitter every day just spewing out hateful messages.
[03:01:54.782 --> 03:01:58.746]  Anytime there's a white person involved with anything, he's automatically a Nazi.
[03:01:58.746 --> 03:01:59.928]  He's automatically this and that.
[03:01:59.928 --> 03:02:01.689]  This guy has a huge following.
[03:02:01.689 --> 03:02:06.675]  He says that everyone that was involved with the anti-Sharia march were all closet racists.
[03:02:06.675 --> 03:02:08.797]  They were closet Islamophobes and that's what
[03:02:08.917 --> 03:02:10.418]  I'm not a closet Islamophobe.
[03:02:10.418 --> 03:02:11.718]  I'm very phobic of Islam.
[03:02:11.718 --> 03:02:15.880]  I don't want anywhere near Saudi Arabia or these places where women walk around in hoods.
[03:02:15.880 --> 03:02:21.123]  I'd have a panic attack walking around the street with a bunch of women with hoods over their heads and guys walking around wearing diapers and everything.
[03:02:21.123 --> 03:02:21.523]  I don't like it.
[03:02:22.483 --> 03:02:23.725]  Yeah, I don't want, like, a teletubby.
[03:02:23.725 --> 03:02:26.608]  I don't want, like, a closed-up umbrella walking through the streets.
[03:02:26.608 --> 03:02:28.110]  This stuff is crazy.
[03:02:28.110 --> 03:02:32.115]  And we're racist because we don't want what we're seeing happen in Europe coming over here.
[03:02:32.115 --> 03:02:34.539]  And it's already starting to happen here.
[03:02:34.539 --> 03:02:36.621]  I mean, we've already had the Orlando shooting.
[03:02:36.621 --> 03:02:37.963]  We've already had San Bernardino.
[03:02:37.963 --> 03:02:39.144]  We've already had Chattanooga.
[03:02:39.745 --> 03:02:46.311]  9-11, I mean time and time again we've had so many things and yet they just go oh well it's okay though it's not all Muslims.
[03:02:46.311 --> 03:02:56.440]  Yeah it's not all Muslims but it's a 1.7 billion population and only takes a small percentage of those guys to be bad and inflict harm on 10 times more than that and it's already happening.
[03:02:56.440 --> 03:02:56.740]  Listen!
[03:02:57.685 --> 03:03:01.727]  If you want to get into Switzerland or Japan, you've got to have a degree and some money in your ass.
[03:03:01.727 --> 03:03:04.428]  And they don't care if you're black, you don't care if you're Asian, they don't care.
[03:03:04.428 --> 03:03:06.729]  You better have your stuff squared away.
[03:03:06.729 --> 03:03:13.592]  Nobody brings in people from failed Muslim states like Somalia and Sudan and Syria.
[03:03:13.592 --> 03:03:14.833]  It's nutball.
[03:03:14.833 --> 03:03:21.716]  And I'm sure you've now seen where now the German Green Party wants to bring in whole villages and transplant them into German villages.
[03:03:22.256 --> 03:03:27.699]  Yeah, there's 600,000 population of Shia Muslims in Germany alone.
[03:03:27.699 --> 03:03:37.346]  Those are the same kind of people that do the tot beer, where every year they take blades and swords and smash them into their foreheads until they split their own heads open.
[03:03:37.346 --> 03:03:38.706]  They're going to split their own heads open.
[03:03:38.706 --> 03:03:42.289]  What makes you think they're not going to lob your head off?
[03:03:42.289 --> 03:03:49.553]  All I know is, it's total and sane asylum behavior.
[03:03:52.972 --> 03:03:55.013]  I just can't believe the left has gone so mentally ill.
[03:03:55.013 --> 03:03:57.094]  Where do you think this ends, Joe Biggs?
[03:03:57.094 --> 03:04:03.137]  It definitely ends with someone trying to take an attempt on President Trump's life.
[03:04:03.137 --> 03:04:09.439]  It ends with someone doing something like that, trying to spark... Well, we've already seen the guy trying to grab the gun from the cop and do that in other events, sure.
[03:04:09.439 --> 03:04:12.541]  But I mean, I think it ends with them attacking Trump supporters.
[03:04:12.541 --> 03:04:14.101]  This is really an attempt at bullying.
[03:04:14.101 --> 03:04:18.003]  Just like Hitler bombing civilian centers in World War II in England, it had the opposite effect.
[03:04:18.003 --> 03:04:19.564]  He thought it would make the Brits give up.
[03:04:19.564 --> 03:04:21.685]  They actually got solidified because of that.
[03:04:22.225 --> 03:04:34.732]  There's actually a group of Antifa I found out yesterday that meet every Thursday at a public library in Austin, Texas under the guise of a history class where they go in and they do homework or whatever.
[03:04:34.732 --> 03:04:36.373]  And Antifa is allowed to openly
[03:04:37.051 --> 03:04:44.777]  Discuss what they're doing, their communism and their tactics to attack people, especially for the July 1st march that's going to be next Saturday at the Capitol.
[03:04:44.777 --> 03:04:49.901]  They're allowed to openly discuss that stuff in a public library without anything.
[03:04:49.901 --> 03:04:50.902]  It's ridiculous.
[03:04:50.902 --> 03:04:56.766]  But we go meet somewhere and we talk about how we're Trump supporters like the Portland State students and they get shut down.
[03:04:56.766 --> 03:04:57.387]  They're harassed.
[03:04:57.387 --> 03:04:57.887]  That's right.
[03:04:57.887 --> 03:04:58.668]  Joe Biggs, thank you.
[03:05:00.086 --> 03:05:03.909]  Wow, you're going to love the latest idea out of the EU.
[03:05:03.909 --> 03:05:14.496]  Scott Keller, a German member of the European Parliament and of the Green Party, said we should transplant entire villages from Syria to Germany, and that would encourage more migrants to enter Germany.
[03:05:14.496 --> 03:05:15.757]  Listen to these quotes.
[03:05:15.757 --> 03:05:23.583]  The idea of Syrian villages is only one possibility we can use, for example, if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees.
[03:05:23.823 --> 03:05:29.308]  People would rather go where compatriots already live, which makes integration and acceptance easier.
[03:05:29.308 --> 03:05:31.310]  Let's look at these three compatriots.
[03:05:31.310 --> 03:05:32.571]  From Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:05:32.571 --> 03:05:32.971]  Sweden.
[03:05:32.971 --> 03:05:35.934]  Migrants viciously beat disabled man while calling him racist.
[03:05:35.934 --> 03:05:42.140]  Three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a homeless man's wallet in a train station during an incident which took place last month.
[03:05:42.140 --> 03:05:49.146]  The handicapped man was kicked and punched and received a vicious uppercut as one of the migrants lectured him about war on Muslims and how all Swedes were racist.
[03:05:49.446 --> 03:05:51.367]  Now how's that for acceptance?
[03:05:51.367 --> 03:05:54.629]  You can read both articles now on InfoWars.com.
[03:05:54.629 --> 03:06:02.054]  Roger reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:06:02.054 --> 03:06:03.495]  Let's go to David in Florida.
[03:06:03.495 --> 03:06:04.756]  David in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:06:05.737 --> 03:06:07.318]  Great, hey thank you so much.
[03:06:07.318 --> 03:06:11.840]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[03:06:11.840 --> 03:06:20.943]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[03:06:20.943 --> 03:06:21.704]  Wow, thank you.
[03:06:21.704 --> 03:06:24.345]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[03:06:24.345 --> 03:06:26.165]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[03:06:26.165 --> 03:06:29.647]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[03:06:29.647 --> 03:06:30.247]  That's amazing.
[03:06:30.267 --> 03:06:30.908]  Incredible.
[03:06:30.908 --> 03:06:34.291]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:06:34.291 --> 03:06:35.312]  I haven't felt this week.
[03:06:35.312 --> 03:06:36.973]  My morning was fantastic.
[03:06:36.973 --> 03:06:38.234]  And I love you guys.
[03:06:38.234 --> 03:06:40.396]  I love the InfoWars crew.
[03:06:40.396 --> 03:06:47.242]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[03:06:47.242 --> 03:06:48.283]  You will love it.

[03:08:25.145 --> 03:08:31.489]  Hollywood!
[03:08:31.489 --> 03:08:34.191]  Hollywood!
[03:08:34.191 --> 03:08:37.033]  Hollywood!
[03:08:37.033 --> 03:08:37.573]  Hollywood!
[03:08:40.899 --> 03:08:42.220]  I'm going to let Cernovich take over.
[03:08:42.220 --> 03:08:43.380]  He's in DC.
[03:08:43.380 --> 03:08:44.861]  Soon, he'll have some big scoops for you.
[03:08:44.861 --> 03:08:49.442]  He already has them, but he's got to let those develop a little bit.
[03:08:49.442 --> 03:08:52.464]  Things too fresh, you know, exposure sources.
[03:08:52.464 --> 03:08:56.805]  But, look at this headline out of the New York Daily News.
[03:08:56.805 --> 03:08:57.226]  June 20th.
[03:08:57.226 --> 03:09:00.627]  This came out a few days ago, I just saw it.
[03:09:00.627 --> 03:09:03.668]  Celebrities, Alex Jones, and sexual abuse.
[03:09:03.668 --> 03:09:05.909]  Read the article, there's nothing about me and sexual abuse.
[03:09:05.909 --> 03:09:06.589]  They just say that.
[03:09:06.589 --> 03:09:08.830]  That's called fake news.
[03:09:08.830 --> 03:09:09.310]  Here's another one.
[03:09:09.310 --> 03:09:10.311]  Testosterone wars.
[03:09:11.476 --> 03:09:17.259]  We have like 39 products, most of them private-labeled, best-sellers of companies that supply Whole Foods.
[03:09:17.259 --> 03:09:18.340]  Jeff Bezos owns that.
[03:09:18.340 --> 03:09:24.363]  That's okay, because Jeff Bezos gave $600 million to the Washington Post via the CIA to try to overthrow Trump.
[03:09:24.363 --> 03:09:31.227]  But I sell Supramel Vitality, which they admit is a bunch of known herbs, concentrated, and I'm evil!
[03:09:31.227 --> 03:09:35.710]  I need to be shut down, and I'm bad!
[03:09:35.710 --> 03:09:38.271]  But they reached out to us, but we didn't respond.
[03:09:38.271 --> 03:09:38.872]  A bunch of bull.
[03:09:40.552 --> 03:09:43.977]  Always the same, but people don't buy into that anymore.
[03:09:43.977 --> 03:09:47.762]  And a lot of the left says, we're not calling for Trump's death as they call for it constantly.
[03:09:47.762 --> 03:09:57.595]  And then meth, you know he's a drug addict, meth head, looks like a meth head, child molester, Johnny Depp, creeping around, shaking, hardly talking, I'm not saying he's a child molester.
[03:10:00.031 --> 03:10:04.612]  You know, somebody needs to get Trump in a dark room and stomp on his head.
[03:10:04.612 --> 03:10:07.333]  You know, can an actor kill a president?
[03:10:07.333 --> 03:10:10.234]  Everybody's like, ooh, you're so cool.
[03:10:10.234 --> 03:10:11.734]  Everyone's so sick of Hollywood.
[03:10:11.734 --> 03:10:13.195]  We're so sick of all you people.
[03:10:13.195 --> 03:10:17.836]  This guy made $600 million and he's such a crackhead.
[03:10:17.836 --> 03:10:19.297]  He's bankrupt.
[03:10:19.297 --> 03:10:23.118]  And then stumbling around with some other lunatic on the stage.
[03:10:23.118 --> 03:10:27.239]  And then you look at the crowd, like a bunch of lobotomized walruses.
[03:10:28.632 --> 03:10:29.993]  It's sick!
[03:10:29.993 --> 03:10:38.016]  We've got Mika Brzezinski, whose dad advocated dictatorship and killing populations, developing dictatorship under President Trump.
[03:10:38.016 --> 03:10:40.918]  MSNBC host compares Trump to a suicide bomber.
[03:10:40.918 --> 03:10:43.979]  Another host says that ISIS should bomb Trump.
[03:10:43.979 --> 03:10:50.402]  I mean, this is just a bunch of people that have lived in this bubble of liberty and have been a little aggressive
[03:10:52.348 --> 03:10:57.869]  Wimps, but never been in a real fight their whole life, running around trying to start a war with an armed camp.
[03:10:57.869 --> 03:11:03.370]  But like adults, we're sitting back, letting you kill a few of us, do this and that, shoot some congressmen and cops, trying to get you to stop.
[03:11:03.370 --> 03:11:04.370]  Just saying, please stop.
[03:11:04.370 --> 03:11:05.771]  Please stop.
[03:11:05.771 --> 03:11:06.851]  Okay, start getting ready for them.
[03:11:06.851 --> 03:11:07.291]  Get set up.
[03:11:07.291 --> 03:11:08.211]  Get ready.
[03:11:08.211 --> 03:11:09.712]  Okay, we're trying to fix things peacefully.
[03:11:09.712 --> 03:11:12.152]  Here's some prosperity.
[03:11:12.152 --> 03:11:13.732]  Oh, you're not going to stop, are you?
[03:11:13.732 --> 03:11:16.813]  Well, you're going to be dealt with once the hammer comes down.
[03:11:17.950 --> 03:11:19.630]  Legally and lawfully.
[03:11:19.630 --> 03:11:22.891]  Johnny Depp, all the rest of you, you're gonna get what you want.
[03:11:22.891 --> 03:11:23.871]  It's gonna happen.
[03:11:23.871 --> 03:11:24.652]  Look at this headline.
[03:11:24.652 --> 03:11:26.732]  Hero of the London terror attack.
[03:11:26.732 --> 03:11:28.132]  Homeless.
[03:11:28.132 --> 03:11:31.593]  The Lion of London Bridge.
[03:11:31.593 --> 03:11:34.934]  You know, who fought off the guys so he couldn't kill another six, seven people.
[03:11:34.934 --> 03:11:36.714]  Fought three guys with knives, beat their ass.
[03:11:36.714 --> 03:11:38.735]  The cops showed up and shot him.
[03:11:38.735 --> 03:11:41.695]  He's homeless from his medical bills.
[03:11:41.695 --> 03:11:43.516]  But the Islamists are getting all these free houses.
[03:11:45.299 --> 03:11:47.060]  That's how it works, folks.
[03:11:47.060 --> 03:11:47.641]  It's sick.
[03:11:47.641 --> 03:11:51.644]  America and Europe's openness has been used to destroy us.
[03:11:51.644 --> 03:11:53.945]  The good news is, humanity's striking back.
[03:11:53.945 --> 03:11:59.389]  Mike Cernovich, medium.com at Cernovich, joining us.
[03:11:59.389 --> 03:12:00.790]  So much has happened.
[03:12:00.790 --> 03:12:03.132]  Wow, no one even cares about Megyn Kelly now.
[03:12:03.132 --> 03:12:05.554]  They admit lowest ratings ever.
[03:12:05.554 --> 03:12:06.254]  I can't believe it.
[03:12:06.254 --> 03:12:07.635]  Even though they edited me like hell.
[03:12:08.336 --> 03:12:10.718]  You could have had a ham sandwich up against her.
[03:12:10.718 --> 03:12:12.559]  They would have declared me the victor.
[03:12:12.559 --> 03:12:13.159]  I don't get the credit.
[03:12:13.159 --> 03:12:14.400]  Our listeners, everybody gets the credit.
[03:12:14.400 --> 03:12:18.803]  But we are going to be releasing, next week, the audio.
[03:12:18.803 --> 03:12:21.966]  And when I say edited, we'll release raw clips.
[03:12:21.966 --> 03:12:24.347]  We'll say, here's what I said raw, with a transcript.
[03:12:24.347 --> 03:12:29.131]  Then we'll say, here I said it at this minute, and ten minutes later, or eleven minutes later, said this.
[03:12:29.131 --> 03:12:31.172]  Totally different subjects, edited together.
[03:12:31.172 --> 03:12:31.673]  She did it.
[03:12:32.608 --> 03:12:40.173]  Despite the fact I warned her about Katie Couric, who got caught doing that and got sued over it, she still did it, Mike Cernovich.
[03:12:40.173 --> 03:12:41.454]  Their editor still did it.
[03:12:41.454 --> 03:12:44.196]  And Sean Hannity came out and said, release the full tape.
[03:12:44.196 --> 03:12:46.018]  He knows what Ted Koppel did to him.
[03:12:46.018 --> 03:12:48.560]  Seventy seconds aired after a fifty minute interview.
[03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:52.542]  They interviewed me off and on for twelve hours, four hours straight.
[03:12:52.542 --> 03:12:53.463]  Five hours, probably.
[03:12:53.463 --> 03:12:57.786]  So it just shows how pathetic... Cernovich, we have them.
[03:12:57.786 --> 03:12:59.527]  We have them editing stuff together.
[03:12:59.527 --> 03:13:00.268]  We have them.
[03:13:00.268 --> 03:13:01.309]  Can you believe the arrogance?
[03:13:02.657 --> 03:13:08.522]  Well, CNN, according to the latest ad week, only did 750,000 total viewers.
[03:13:08.522 --> 03:13:09.923]  They're all on the decline.
[03:13:09.923 --> 03:13:10.824]  That's the whole point.
[03:13:10.824 --> 03:13:12.085]  They really are.
[03:13:12.085 --> 03:13:13.426]  They really are nobodies.
[03:13:13.426 --> 03:13:14.887]  They're on the decline.
[03:13:14.887 --> 03:13:15.968]  They're on the fall.
[03:13:15.968 --> 03:13:17.649]  They don't know what they're going to do.
[03:13:17.649 --> 03:13:24.375]  They're so desperate, actually, that Jake Tapper, one of the biggest CIA shills and deep state shills,
[03:13:24.875 --> 03:13:25.596]  We're good to go.
[03:13:53.456 --> 03:13:56.297]  Yeah, I'll probably do the fourth hour the way we're doing it now, just Monday through Friday, the current hour.
[03:13:56.297 --> 03:13:58.739]  But, I mean, there's so much going on, there's so much raw talent, there's so much energy and enthusiasm.
[03:14:17.111 --> 03:14:22.113]  There's so many people out there hungry for the truth and we can't even meet the demand.
[03:14:22.113 --> 03:14:27.194]  So we're going to have to figure out who else is going to be involved with this.
[03:14:27.194 --> 03:14:29.115]  For example, I was in Washington D.C.
[03:14:29.115 --> 03:14:36.617]  I'm out here, I've got some major stories, but I can't release them yet because then they'll be able to find out all my secret sources.
[03:14:36.617 --> 03:14:41.639]  But I'm just sitting down enjoying a cigar with some friends and every five minutes,
[03:14:42.759 --> 03:14:44.361]  Cernovich, how are you?
[03:14:44.361 --> 03:14:50.026]  And again, not bragging, like when I was with you in Austin, the whole restaurant stops and looks.
[03:14:50.026 --> 03:14:54.770]  It's not bragging, it's just showing... It shows the success of the Liberty Movement.
[03:14:54.770 --> 03:14:57.732]  It shows the success, and that's the issue is...
[03:14:58.413 --> 03:15:01.995]  When I was out with Megyn Kelly, I'm not bragging, more people said, there's Alex Jones.
[03:15:01.995 --> 03:15:02.896]  They weren't pointing at Megyn.
[03:15:02.896 --> 03:15:04.617]  It's not that I want to be the big celebrity.
[03:15:04.617 --> 03:15:06.378]  Quite frankly, I wish I wasn't seen in public.
[03:15:06.378 --> 03:15:07.558]  I'm tired of it.
[03:15:07.558 --> 03:15:10.100]  But I see it as we're hurting the globalists.
[03:15:10.100 --> 03:15:11.200]  They're scared.
[03:15:11.200 --> 03:15:12.061]  They're coming after us.
[03:15:12.061 --> 03:15:14.862]  Since you mentioned that, I'm going to play Jay Johnson.
[03:15:14.862 --> 03:15:17.424]  Not pleased, DNA refused, DHS help.
[03:15:17.424 --> 03:15:20.426]  Now Debbie Washerman Schultz has come out and said he's a liar.
[03:15:20.426 --> 03:15:22.107]  So the rats are turning on each other.
[03:15:22.107 --> 03:15:22.447]  Here it is.
[03:15:23.351 --> 03:15:28.194]  As to what was offered them, what they accepted, was there any level of cooperation at all?
[03:15:42.703 --> 03:15:59.627]  Fresh off the OPM experience and there was a point at which DHS cyber security experts did get into OPM and actually help them discover the bad actors and patch some of the exfiltration or at least minimize some of the damage.
[03:15:59.627 --> 03:16:03.208]  And so I was anxious to know whether or not our folks were in there.
[03:16:03.208 --> 03:16:06.829]  And the response I got was FBI had spoken to them.
[03:16:06.829 --> 03:16:09.210]  They don't want our help.
[03:16:09.210 --> 03:16:10.070]  They have CrowdStrike.
[03:16:11.330 --> 03:16:18.633]  You have an unprecedented amount of cyber-hacking by a foreign power, an adversary from my point of view.
[03:16:18.633 --> 03:16:19.453]  Unprecedented?
[03:16:19.453 --> 03:16:25.776]  A load of mother... They had Google, Facebook, everybody against Trump.
[03:16:25.776 --> 03:16:27.677]  The Russians... Yeah, the Russians were tacitly for Trump.
[03:16:27.677 --> 03:16:28.717]  Whoop-dee-frickin-do.
[03:16:28.717 --> 03:16:30.478]  The Pope, the Chai-coms, the EU, all against Trump.
[03:16:39.341 --> 03:16:45.610]  My interest in helping them was definitely a non-partisan interest.
[03:16:45.610 --> 03:16:49.755]  And I recall very clearly that I was not
[03:16:53.273 --> 03:17:00.979]  Oh, so the Democrats literally were naked, wide open.
[03:17:00.979 --> 03:17:02.440]  Hillary had her own server.
[03:17:02.440 --> 03:17:04.101]  She was putting stuff on there for sale.
[03:17:04.101 --> 03:17:04.942]  She knew it was compromised.
[03:17:04.942 --> 03:17:06.403]  She put the classified stuff on.
[03:17:06.403 --> 03:17:06.843]  She got it.
[03:17:06.843 --> 03:17:08.925]  That's what their foundation is.
[03:17:08.925 --> 03:17:10.406]  It's like the Legion of Doom.
[03:17:10.406 --> 03:17:16.611]  Now here's Debbie Washerman Schultz saying that Jay Johnson, their own Homeland Security head, is wrong to respect.
[03:17:16.611 --> 03:17:19.052]  It's on record Homeland Security wanted to get in there.
[03:17:19.052 --> 03:17:19.413]  Here it is.
[03:17:20.134 --> 03:17:20.834]  Look at Jones!
[03:17:20.834 --> 03:17:21.215]  Another kook!
[03:17:21.215 --> 03:17:22.195]  Demonic kook!
[03:17:22.195 --> 03:17:23.876]  She talks like she's on painkillers.
[03:17:46.030 --> 03:17:46.730]  Astounding!
[03:18:07.537 --> 03:18:08.218]  A foreign enemy?
[03:18:08.218 --> 03:18:08.958]  Taking over?
[03:18:08.958 --> 03:18:14.843]  All we want to do is sell you out and teach your kids how to be sexual at age 2 and you don't like us?
[03:18:14.843 --> 03:18:15.663]  Utterly misinformed?
[03:18:37.893 --> 03:18:41.616]  ...much that has been written about the timeline... I am hunting for wabbits.
[03:18:41.616 --> 03:18:47.921]  ...New York Times, The Washington Post, that document through multiple sources including me... Multiple sources.
[03:18:47.921 --> 03:18:57.769]  ...that the FBI and other federal agencies did virtually nothing to make sure that when they were aware... Virtually nothing.
[03:18:57.769 --> 03:18:59.230]  ...at the point that they were aware... They did it.
[03:18:59.230 --> 03:18:59.631]  They did nothing.
[03:18:59.631 --> 03:19:03.714]  ...that there was more concern, that there was an intrusion on our network... An intrusion on our network.
[03:19:04.354 --> 03:19:11.658]  Welcome to McDonald's, may I help you?
[03:19:11.658 --> 03:19:22.343]  Hillary was under investigation for years with the server with all the illegal crap on it, all of you guys, and now it's the FBI's fault that they didn't protect you from the non-existent Russians.
[03:19:22.343 --> 03:19:25.225]  The Russians can hardly keep their lights on, man, after globalis-
[03:19:26.158 --> 03:19:28.540]  Mike Cernovich, I'm skipping this break so you have more time than I took.
[03:19:28.540 --> 03:19:29.761]  I appreciate you, buddy.
[03:19:29.761 --> 03:19:32.903]  Big stuff on D.C., but what do you make of the rats leaving the sinking ship?
[03:19:32.903 --> 03:19:39.087]  What do you make of them losing the fourth special election, and then their answer is, just kill everybody?
[03:19:39.087 --> 03:19:41.189]  Well, the Russian narrative isn't working.
[03:19:41.189 --> 03:19:44.111]  Nancy Pelosi, of course, we want to keep her in power.
[03:19:44.111 --> 03:19:45.032]  She's wonderful.
[03:19:45.032 --> 03:19:50.475]  Everything, if I could orchestrate and control what was happening there, I wouldn't change a thing.
[03:19:50.475 --> 03:19:53.538]  I'm very... Let's replace her with Maxine Waters.
[03:19:54.238 --> 03:19:56.441]  Well, okay, maybe that would be better.
[03:19:56.441 --> 03:19:58.583]  That would be the only way to improve it.
[03:19:58.583 --> 03:20:01.066]  I'm very happy with the way things are going.
[03:20:01.066 --> 03:20:09.134]  I'm very happy that their high-level staffers have been caught with child pornography, that Anthony Weiner is a pedophile, that the message is getting out in the press.
[03:20:10.267 --> 03:20:11.909]  Yeah, that they're loaded with pedophiles.
[03:20:11.909 --> 03:20:14.571]  That's why they didn't want to give their server over there.
[03:20:14.571 --> 03:20:16.793]  I guarantee you there was child pornography on there.
[03:20:16.793 --> 03:20:20.637]  Jacob Schwartz or somebody had some, you know, kind of images of underage people.
[03:20:20.637 --> 03:20:23.780]  That's the real reason that they never gave it to the FBI.
[03:20:23.780 --> 03:20:28.885]  So people are realizing that the DNC is loaded with child molesters, pedophiles.
[03:20:28.885 --> 03:20:30.647]  Well, they all look like child molesters.
[03:20:31.678 --> 03:20:32.279]  Exactly.
[03:20:32.279 --> 03:20:35.265]  And that's why they have no message for the American people.
[03:20:35.265 --> 03:20:38.531]  Why is it child molesters always look like child molesters?
[03:20:38.531 --> 03:20:40.414]  They never look like John Wayne.
[03:20:40.414 --> 03:20:41.957]  They never look like Donald Trump.
[03:20:41.957 --> 03:20:43.459]  They always look like child molesters.
[03:20:44.906 --> 03:20:45.787]  It's a great question.
[03:20:45.787 --> 03:20:46.768]  It's physiognomy.
[03:20:46.768 --> 03:20:52.274]  You know, you look at the facial features of somebody and you can predict a lot of things about them.
[03:20:52.274 --> 03:20:56.019]  And there is a certain look, the pedophile look.
[03:20:56.019 --> 03:20:58.842]  Yeah, they look like Dennis Hastert.
[03:20:58.842 --> 03:21:03.247]  The guy that shot Scalise from Illinois, he looks like a Dennis Hastert clone.
[03:21:03.247 --> 03:21:04.448]  I mean, he looks like a pedophile.
[03:21:05.402 --> 03:21:10.884]  Exactly, that's why he wanted to kill the Republicans to shut down investigations into pedophilia.
[03:21:10.884 --> 03:21:13.344]  He knew that the Democrats are his best bet.
[03:21:13.344 --> 03:21:19.566]  And another guy that looks like a pedophile, who, I think he was a Nebraska guy who said that he's glad the shooting happened?
[03:21:19.566 --> 03:21:20.786]  Yeah.
[03:21:20.786 --> 03:21:29.569]  That guy, there was another guy, a video today of a Democratic operative who said that, and of course I'm not saying he is a pedophile, but I'm saying- Hey, doesn't Johnny Depp look like a pedophile?
[03:21:30.484 --> 03:21:33.046]  Oh, if you look at him, he definitely has that vibe.
[03:21:33.046 --> 03:21:34.006]  There's no question.
[03:21:34.006 --> 03:21:35.867]  There's no question he has the vibe.
[03:21:35.867 --> 03:21:38.629]  Oh yeah, so the, yeah, that's the shooter.
[03:21:38.629 --> 03:21:41.451]  You look at them, they look like it, right?
[03:21:41.451 --> 03:21:49.576]  And then there was a guy from Nebraska who was caught on an audio, leaked audio, where he said that he was glad that Scalise was shot.
[03:21:49.576 --> 03:21:51.957]  And then you look at him and he looks like Dennis Hastert, too.
[03:21:51.957 --> 03:21:52.998]  Well, here's my next question.
[03:21:52.998 --> 03:21:53.498]  You're a smart guy.
[03:21:53.498 --> 03:21:54.579]  I talk to a lot of smart folks.
[03:21:55.299 --> 03:22:04.770]  We're holding back, we don't want to be violent, we're winning, you know, letting them shoot congressmen and stuff, we try to stop it, but they're clearly, the left's building up for a bigger tantrum, a bigger confrontation.
[03:22:04.770 --> 03:22:07.734]  How long do we take this though until Trump moves against them?
[03:22:07.734 --> 03:22:08.074]  I think...
[03:22:08.851 --> 03:22:14.353]  You know, the folks over at Brzezinski Land on Morning Joe, they're saying, oh, watch out, Trump's about to become a dictator.
[03:22:14.353 --> 03:22:15.553]  No, he got elected.
[03:22:15.553 --> 03:22:21.955]  But if we have to move in a very serious way against people openly wanting to murder everybody, that's called your duty.
[03:22:21.955 --> 03:22:23.656]  I don't want to have a big shooting war.
[03:22:23.656 --> 03:22:28.017]  I don't want to have to, you know, arrest 10,000 of these people and have trials and hang their asses.
[03:22:28.017 --> 03:22:30.758]  But if it's done by a jury and we need to, I'll be there and pull the switch.
[03:22:30.758 --> 03:22:36.099]  I mean, I'm not going to sit here and, you know, you know, just call for, you know, stuff without actually being part of it.
[03:22:36.099 --> 03:22:37.580]  I mean, how long can they keep pushing for this?
[03:22:38.360 --> 03:22:44.986]  Well, this Sunday, the domestic terrorist group Antifa is going to actually have a riot in Washington, D.C.
[03:22:44.986 --> 03:22:46.727]  in front of the police station.
[03:22:46.727 --> 03:22:50.730]  I sent the producers a picture of some graffiti that I found.
[03:22:50.730 --> 03:22:57.316]  So, yeah, this Sunday, June 25th, they're actually going to go start a riot against the D.C.
[03:22:57.316 --> 03:22:58.156]  police.
[03:22:58.156 --> 03:23:01.079]  So they're setting their own trap, man.
[03:23:01.079 --> 03:23:06.083]  The police aren't going to take too kindly to this plan, to a terrorist plan that they have.
[03:23:07.666 --> 03:23:08.868]  I'm just getting sick of it.
[03:23:08.868 --> 03:23:15.014]  I mean, you know, we have actual communists here in Austin marching around with guns with their fingers on the triggers.
[03:23:15.014 --> 03:23:17.097]  We have an open carry and our rivals are pointed at the ground.
[03:23:17.097 --> 03:23:18.078]  They're not loaded.
[03:23:18.078 --> 03:23:19.860]  We're exercising it to have the right.
[03:23:19.860 --> 03:23:20.541]  We're not out there.
[03:23:22.337 --> 03:23:34.507]  My reporters were there and I'm like watch the video where these communists have their guns like this towards the cops and my reporters and I mean I'm sorry I can't go to these because if this guy has a gun towards me I'm going to attack him because that's an act of aggression.
[03:23:34.507 --> 03:23:35.808]  That's menacing me.
[03:23:35.808 --> 03:23:37.870]  Under state law his ass needs to be arrested.
[03:23:38.490 --> 03:23:41.715]  So I'm Mr. Anti-Police State when their left is controlled.
[03:23:41.715 --> 03:23:46.061]  But if you're going to have dangerous, violent groups trying to start a civil war, it needs to be nipped in the bud now.
[03:23:46.061 --> 03:23:49.626]  This is racketeering under every federal and state law.
[03:23:49.626 --> 03:23:52.090]  The Democrats and all of them are a clear and present danger.
[03:23:52.090 --> 03:23:52.710]  And I can tell you...
[03:23:53.490 --> 03:23:55.553]  Special operations, the Pentagon, you name it.
[03:23:55.553 --> 03:24:00.038]  Still has moles in it from Obama, but in general, 90% are ready.
[03:24:00.038 --> 03:24:03.843]  If a civil war starts, there is a big Christmas list of these leftists.
[03:24:03.843 --> 03:24:06.286]  So I hope every one of them that wants violence and war knows this.
[03:24:06.286 --> 03:24:10.851]  I'm not going to talk about what people are planning in defense of this, but you just know this.
[03:24:10.851 --> 03:24:11.873]  This is a two-way street.
[03:24:13.163 --> 03:24:27.914]  Yeah, there's also an Antifa terrorist group in Phoenix, Arizona, and they have a gun club, and on their message boards and their private WhatsApp groups and everything, they've said that they need to do more tactical training to murder people, essentially.
[03:24:27.914 --> 03:24:36.260]  That's right, they're very upset at the Huffington Post and their places, that the guy wasn't tactically better, there weren't more dead.
[03:24:36.260 --> 03:24:41.384]  They all bemoaned that, the Huntington Republicans, they said, too bad there wasn't more, we need more dead.
[03:24:42.290 --> 03:24:45.833]  Yeah, and one thing, this is probably the only thing keeping me alive.
[03:24:45.833 --> 03:25:11.873]  I was actually met by a very menacing, reptilian, pedophile kind of person on one of my trips, and he came forward and he wanted to give me a warning, so I handed him a slip of paper on it, and I'm not going to say what names were on it, but there were ten names on it, and I said, just so you know, if anything happens to me, it's going to go all points bulletin that these are the ten people that are going to be deemed responsible for my death and my murder.
[03:25:12.193 --> 03:25:16.677]  So you make sure that that gets up the food chain to the people that you're acting on your behalf for.
[03:25:16.677 --> 03:25:18.058]  And he freaked out.
[03:25:18.058 --> 03:25:20.160]  It looked like he was like a ghost hit him.
[03:25:20.160 --> 03:25:27.246]  And I said, yeah, if you think you're just going to kill me and have me disappear, know that these 10 people, it's a dead man switch.
[03:25:27.246 --> 03:25:30.308]  I go, these 10 people are going to be held accountable for it.
[03:25:30.308 --> 03:25:36.394]  And you just make sure that they know if that's how you want to play and something happens to me, there are a lot of people.
[03:25:37.114 --> 03:25:40.776]  Who, that list will be made public, and then what happens after you murder me?
[03:25:40.776 --> 03:25:42.357]  I won't have any sympathy for you.
[03:25:42.357 --> 03:25:47.801]  Let's get a little bit more into this, because these people always think when they threaten you, it doesn't scare you, it freaks them out.
[03:25:47.801 --> 03:25:52.203]  And I'm not bragging, but the next person threatens me, I'm punching them right in the throat.
[03:25:52.203 --> 03:25:56.546]  You're not a wimpy guy yourself, you're a big guy, so like, I mean, describe what this was like.
[03:25:57.443 --> 03:26:18.099]  Okay so he was very he had that kind of sunken in creepy face that we you know that we all know of a little bit too polished a little bit too smooth uh sunken in he was uh skinny and lanky with these long kind of features psychopathic traits yeah yeah the typical like you can look at that and he had a sociopathic thing and he came up and he's
[03:26:19.284 --> 03:26:28.288]  Michael Cernovich and you you get chills down your neck when these people talk to you because you can feel their the energy or vibe and I was like their commitment to evil.
[03:26:28.288 --> 03:26:30.529]  Yeah, I really was like, I was like, what is this?
[03:26:30.529 --> 03:26:34.050]  And he goes, so you've been very busy looking at things haven't you?
[03:26:34.050 --> 03:26:36.431]  And I go, what are you talking about, man?
[03:26:36.431 --> 03:26:41.153]  He goes, you know that you're a little bit closer to some of these things than you should be.
[03:26:41.153 --> 03:26:42.514]  Some of these stories are on you.
[03:26:42.514 --> 03:26:45.695]  We've let you go farther than you're probably should be allowed to go.
[03:26:47.065 --> 03:26:49.006]  And I go, okay, so what are you saying?
[03:26:49.006 --> 03:26:50.868]  Cause I'm a big put it on the table kind of guy.
[03:26:50.868 --> 03:26:51.608]  I'm like, what are you saying?
[03:26:51.608 --> 03:26:57.912]  He's like, well, there are a lot of people very disturbed by the things that you're looking into and that creepy little vibe.
[03:26:57.912 --> 03:27:01.415]  So then I just, I had a pen on me and I said, you know, hold on a second.
[03:27:01.415 --> 03:27:02.495]  I said, hold on a second.
[03:27:02.495 --> 03:27:03.256]  Woo.
[03:27:03.256 --> 03:27:07.058]  And he stood there and you know, they're very still and cold again.
[03:27:07.058 --> 03:27:08.099]  They don't even feel human.
[03:27:08.099 --> 03:27:09.640]  So he had a little, yeah.
[03:27:09.640 --> 03:27:16.625]  So I took a pen out and I had a little, uh, scratch piece of paper and I wrote down, you accidentally did this with the pen just in his throat.
[03:27:17.385 --> 03:27:19.686]  No, because I knew that they were going to murder you.
[03:27:19.686 --> 03:27:20.106]  No, I'm joking.
[03:27:20.106 --> 03:27:20.486]  I'm joking.
[03:27:20.486 --> 03:27:22.186]  Go ahead.
[03:27:22.186 --> 03:27:31.888]  So what I did is I wrote 10 names on and I said, these are the 10 people I want you to know that if I am murdered, these 10 people will be held responsible.
[03:27:31.888 --> 03:27:36.589]  And suddenly he looked at me and then he did not like that.
[03:27:36.589 --> 03:27:45.131]  He gave me a look and scurried away because I don't know if he thought he was just going to scare me, but the names of the people that were on that list,
[03:27:46.411 --> 03:27:48.333]  I got his attention.
[03:27:48.333 --> 03:27:50.094]  You're going to take over here, but let me add one more thing.
[03:27:50.094 --> 03:27:52.955]  We were talking about how we fund ourselves.
[03:27:52.955 --> 03:27:54.436]  Evil shampoo, evil toothpaste.
[03:27:54.436 --> 03:27:56.777]  Toothpaste is now overall the best seller of the nutraceuticals.
[03:27:56.777 --> 03:28:02.521]  It's the super male profit wise, but the brain force overall sells, but we have very little profit on that.
[03:28:03.323 --> 03:28:12.628]  Big article in Atlantic Monthly, which is the elite publication calling for overthrowing Trump, testosterone wars, basically saying I'm a criminal, I need to be shut down, I'm a horrible person.
[03:28:12.628 --> 03:28:18.451]  I'm selling a product that's sold under another label, you know, at Whole Foods and on Amazon.
[03:28:18.451 --> 03:28:20.853]  Bezos can sell all this stuff, but I can't.
[03:28:20.853 --> 03:28:22.914]  What hypocritical, pathetic worms.
[03:28:22.914 --> 03:28:26.776]  But they are so upset, they don't understand I could fund myself with any mechanism.
[03:28:26.776 --> 03:28:30.718]  I can flip a switch and raise $500 million right now.
[03:28:30.718 --> 03:28:31.779]  They just don't get it, do they?
[03:28:32.622 --> 03:28:44.450]  Well, that's another thing that I find endlessly amusing, is you can walk down Whole Foods, Amazon sells supplements, Whole Foods sells it, Trader Joe's sells it, pharmaceuticals... Because they work!
[03:28:44.450 --> 03:28:44.970]  Right.
[03:28:44.970 --> 03:28:50.774]  But the point is, where's the expose on Whole Foods selling supplements, selling the same things you sell?
[03:28:50.774 --> 03:28:52.395]  Selling the Emrix Essential.
[03:28:52.395 --> 03:28:54.677]  You can buy citrus-based products
[03:28:55.337 --> 03:28:59.180]  You can buy my entire Emmerich's Essentials line at Whole Foods.
[03:28:59.180 --> 03:29:00.141]  It's one of their top sellers.
[03:29:00.141 --> 03:29:01.102]  Private label by us.
[03:29:01.102 --> 03:29:03.683]  So why is my sunscreen evil?
[03:29:03.683 --> 03:29:06.005]  Or why is my vitamins evil but theirs is good?
[03:29:06.005 --> 03:29:09.348]  And the thing is, the left knows supplements work.
[03:29:09.348 --> 03:29:10.869]  It's one of the few things they're smart about.
[03:29:11.957 --> 03:29:14.618]  Well, they just want to do anything to attack you.
[03:29:14.618 --> 03:29:17.780]  It's just you get used to it at this point.
[03:29:17.780 --> 03:29:23.063]  If you sold people bottled water, they would say, well, bottled water is a scam.
[03:29:23.063 --> 03:29:23.844]  You're like, well, wait a minute.
[03:29:23.844 --> 03:29:25.204]  Everybody sells bottled water.
[03:29:25.204 --> 03:29:29.927]  If you sold silverware or plates or computers or iPhones or whatever,
[03:29:30.307 --> 03:29:33.828]  Then they would immediately say, oh, that's a scam and that doesn't really work.
[03:29:33.828 --> 03:29:35.348]  Yeah, well, you know why Tech X2, it works.
[03:29:35.348 --> 03:29:36.909]  Free shipping running through July 4th.
[03:29:36.909 --> 03:29:38.029]  Cernovich Takeover.
[03:29:38.029 --> 03:29:38.749]  Great job, my friend.
[03:29:38.749 --> 03:29:39.769]  It was great having you here in Austin.
[03:29:39.769 --> 03:29:41.610]  And we're getting ready to launch the next level.
[03:29:41.610 --> 03:29:42.010]  They know it.
[03:29:42.010 --> 03:29:42.930]  They got all their phones tapped.
[03:29:42.930 --> 03:29:43.570]  They know.
[03:29:43.570 --> 03:29:45.071]  They know what's going on.
[03:29:45.071 --> 03:29:46.431]  All right, Mike Cernovich coming up.
[03:29:46.431 --> 03:29:48.411]  Stay with us.
[03:29:48.411 --> 03:29:49.812]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.812 --> 03:29:52.332]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.332 --> 03:29:55.013]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.457 --> 03:30:05.341]  Donald Trump just held a rally in Iowa, and one of the people in attendance, our anonymous sources say, was Bill Clinton.
[03:30:05.341 --> 03:30:06.682]  Well, how do we know it was Bill Clinton?
[03:30:06.682 --> 03:30:16.949]  Because while Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise and the other three Americans who were shot at the ball field by a deranged Bernie supporter, Democratic operatives began blowing their Bill Clinton rape whistles.
[03:30:16.949 --> 03:30:22.472]  I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend.
[03:30:23.633 --> 03:30:26.174]  Somebody that I've got to know very well.
[03:30:26.174 --> 03:30:27.514]  Steve Scalise!
[03:30:27.514 --> 03:30:27.754]  Right?
[03:30:27.754 --> 03:30:33.775]  Because that's the only reason you would try to interrupt a president as he was sending out his thoughts and prayers to somebody who had recently been shot, right?
[03:30:33.775 --> 03:30:34.776]  Come on, work with me here.
[03:30:34.776 --> 03:30:36.976]  The Democrats can't even protest right.
[03:30:36.976 --> 03:30:38.176]  These people fail at everything.
[03:30:38.176 --> 03:30:42.497]  They lose elections, they lose public support, and now they look like thoughtless cowards.
[03:30:42.497 --> 03:30:43.478]  It's just as Trump said.
[03:30:43.478 --> 03:30:44.438]  Never fails!
[03:30:47.734 --> 03:30:49.555]  You can check out the video on InfoWars.com.
[03:30:49.555 --> 03:30:53.496]  Protesters blow whistles as Trump sends thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise.
[03:30:53.496 --> 03:30:55.096]  And that part about Bill Clinton being in the audience?
[03:30:55.096 --> 03:30:56.356]  That was fake news.
[03:30:56.356 --> 03:30:59.217]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:30:59.217 --> 03:31:09.380]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[03:31:09.600 --> 03:31:16.686]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:16.686 --> 03:31:21.569]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:21.569 --> 03:31:25.232]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[03:31:26.513 --> 03:31:27.234]  We're good to go.
[03:31:50.413 --> 03:31:56.715]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:31:56.715 --> 03:31:59.176]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:31:59.176 --> 03:32:04.577]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:32:04.577 --> 03:32:07.418]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[03:32:07.418 --> 03:32:09.399]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[03:32:09.399 --> 03:32:14.260]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[03:32:14.400 --> 03:32:16.501]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:32:16.501 --> 03:32:17.802]  In fact, it's certified.
[03:32:17.802 --> 03:32:22.926]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:32:22.926 --> 03:32:29.650]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:32:29.790 --> 03:32:32.772]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:32:32.772 --> 03:32:36.474]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:32:36.474 --> 03:32:43.398]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:32:43.398 --> 03:32:50.903]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[03:32:50.903 --> 03:32:58.688]  Learn more about InfoWarsLife Super Blue Toothpaste at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWar while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[03:33:04.518 --> 03:33:07.180]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:33:07.180 --> 03:33:09.422]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:09.422 --> 03:33:15.686]  And now, your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:33:15.686 --> 03:33:16.447]  And we're back.
[03:33:16.447 --> 03:33:17.167]  Welcome back.
[03:33:17.167 --> 03:33:18.368]  Mike Cernovich here.
[03:33:18.368 --> 03:33:20.610]  Apologize for the hair.
[03:33:20.610 --> 03:33:22.231]  It got rained on in D.C.
[03:33:22.231 --> 03:33:26.914]  I wasn't expecting the weather, so we gotta get this hair fixed up.
[03:33:26.914 --> 03:33:31.437]  But that aside, we have some cool things planned just so you know if you're in the Washington D.C.
[03:33:31.437 --> 03:33:31.678]  area.
[03:33:32.378 --> 03:33:35.462]  Tonight we're hosting a, we call them a MAGA meetup.
[03:33:35.462 --> 03:33:39.146]  These are very important events to connect with other like-minded patriots.
[03:33:39.146 --> 03:33:40.808]  We always have a great turnout.
[03:33:40.808 --> 03:33:44.332]  There's a picture on my Twitter of the kind of people who show up.
[03:33:44.332 --> 03:33:45.994]  It's always a great time.
[03:33:45.994 --> 03:33:48.496]  That is tonight, Friday at 7 p.m.
[03:33:48.496 --> 03:33:49.478]  Eastern Standard Time.
[03:33:49.958 --> 03:33:50.979]  In Washington, D.C.
[03:33:50.979 --> 03:33:52.179]  at the Trump Hotel.
[03:33:52.179 --> 03:33:52.979]  Just come on out.
[03:33:52.979 --> 03:33:54.080]  We're all in the bar area.
[03:33:54.080 --> 03:33:55.241]  We just hang out.
[03:33:55.241 --> 03:33:58.502]  There's always, you know, 50 or 100 of us connecting.
[03:33:58.502 --> 03:34:00.323]  So, yeah, there's a picture from the last time.
[03:34:00.323 --> 03:34:01.804]  We always have a good time.
[03:34:01.804 --> 03:34:06.566]  Community is important because the fake news media wants you to feel isolated.
[03:34:06.566 --> 03:34:08.147]  And that's not even everybody who shows up.
[03:34:08.147 --> 03:34:11.648]  There's always way more people there, but not everybody wants to be in a picture.
[03:34:11.648 --> 03:34:15.670]  So the fake news media wants you to feel like you're isolated and alone.
[03:34:15.670 --> 03:34:16.711]  And we're everywhere.
[03:34:16.711 --> 03:34:19.092]  And that's, again, why I talk about being recognized in public.
[03:34:19.532 --> 03:34:25.917]  It isn't a brag or even that I care, it's just every time I'm recognized in public, that's a patriot right there.
[03:34:25.917 --> 03:34:33.544]  Every time somebody says, hey, Cernovich, I know right away, wow, there's another, even in D.C., the swamp, we're in the swamp right now.
[03:34:33.544 --> 03:34:37.147]  Patriots everywhere you go tonight, there'll be patriots everywhere.
[03:34:37.147 --> 03:34:38.748]  And then Sunday at noon,
[03:34:40.287 --> 03:34:45.189]  We're hosting a rally, a rally against political violence in front of the White House.
[03:34:45.189 --> 03:34:49.411]  I have heard that actually InfoWars may be live streaming the entire event.
[03:34:49.411 --> 03:34:54.573]  I don't have final confirmation on that, but we were, you know, I'll have periscopes and YouTube Live and everything.
[03:34:54.573 --> 03:34:57.754]  And that is this coming Sunday at noon.
[03:34:57.754 --> 03:35:00.455]  It is a rally against political violence.
[03:35:00.455 --> 03:35:02.196]  Jack Pasobico will be there.
[03:35:02.196 --> 03:35:04.077]  Roger Stone is going to be there.
[03:35:04.077 --> 03:35:09.459]  Laura Loomer, who you saw from Shakespeare in the Park, Cassandra Fairbanks, Lucien Wintrys, Mike Flynn Jr.
[03:35:10.419 --> 03:35:12.641]  Ali, Anna Kate, Mike Cernovich.
[03:35:12.641 --> 03:35:14.303]  It's going to be a big event.
[03:35:14.303 --> 03:35:16.225]  We're going to have a lot of people.
[03:35:16.225 --> 03:35:17.827]  It is going to be a lot of fun.
[03:35:17.827 --> 03:35:22.972]  And that is this Sunday, June 25th at noon in front of the White House.
[03:35:22.972 --> 03:35:31.420]  And you can find that information on the Facebook page or, you know, follow at twitter.com forward slash C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H all over there.
[03:35:31.420 --> 03:35:33.802]  Now, the reason the reason we hold these events
[03:35:35.258 --> 03:35:44.526]  Because you feel alone, because everywhere you're bombarded with violence, Hollywood, fake news, they make it seem like we're some kind of French movement.
[03:35:44.526 --> 03:35:47.088]  They make it seem like there are only few people.
[03:35:47.088 --> 03:35:53.193]  We're actually, I'm more mainstream than people in the mainstream, Alex is more mainstream than I am.
[03:35:53.193 --> 03:35:58.057]  There are patriots everywhere, so our job is to connect all of you.
[03:35:58.057 --> 03:36:02.381]  And there's also a hashtag, M-A-G-A M-E-E-T U-P-S.
[03:36:03.314 --> 03:36:04.375]  MAGA Meetups.
[03:36:04.375 --> 03:36:07.096]  Not UPS like the store, it's more like UPS.
[03:36:07.096 --> 03:36:25.747]  So MAGA Meetups is a hashtag, so if you want to start a local event or you want to meet like-minded patriots in whatever city, you can just go on Twitter and type in hashtag MAGA Meetups or you can follow the Twitter account at MAGA, M-E-E-T-U-P-S.
[03:36:25.747 --> 03:36:27.849]  So the important thing is we have to unite
[03:36:28.829 --> 03:36:30.130]  As patriots.
[03:36:30.130 --> 03:36:32.991]  And we also, we have to network with each other too.
[03:36:32.991 --> 03:36:36.253]  We all know, everybody, here's the official MAGA Meetups page.
[03:36:36.253 --> 03:36:47.338]  You can follow MAGAUPS on Twitter because, you know, everybody listening to this knows that feeling that what if people find out I'm a patriot?
[03:36:47.338 --> 03:36:50.419]  If my job finds out I'm a patriot, I'm going to be fired.
[03:36:50.419 --> 03:36:53.040]  If people find out I'm a patriot, maybe they're going to be violent.
[03:36:53.040 --> 03:36:54.241]  Who knows what is going to happen?
[03:36:54.801 --> 03:36:54.961]  I don't
[03:37:15.425 --> 03:37:18.567]  This is the kind of thing to get the coverage.
[03:37:18.567 --> 03:37:20.889]  This is what pays for events.
[03:37:20.889 --> 03:37:23.731]  This is what gets people out to Washington D.C.
[03:37:23.731 --> 03:37:27.734]  to do a live stream of these rallies that not everybody can attend to.
[03:37:27.734 --> 03:37:40.943]  So even when you can't make it out of the house and you can't make it to one of our events, by supporting the broadcast at Infowarsstore.com and buying the toothpaste and taking the nootropics and all the great testosterone products,
[03:37:41.343 --> 03:37:45.396]  You're actually bringing more people together because we are the resistance.
[03:37:46.300 --> 03:38:09.315]  Speaking of the resistance, we now are going to have Katie McEwan, who she was actually recently fired from Breitbart, over a tweet which, based on what Breitbart writes in the articles that they write, a lot of people would think, well, wait a minute, why was she fired for tweeting out essentially what Breitbart talks about all the time, which is the link between radical Islam and terrorism.
[03:38:09.315 --> 03:38:11.537]  So if Katie's on the line, how you doing?
[03:38:11.537 --> 03:38:13.958]  How you doing, Mike?
[03:38:13.958 --> 03:38:14.419]  Doing great.
[03:38:14.419 --> 03:38:15.660]  Thank you for being able to make it today.
[03:38:16.414 --> 03:38:18.577]  Yeah, well thank you for having me on.
[03:38:18.577 --> 03:38:21.761]  So for those of you who don't know, maybe briefly introduce yourself.
[03:38:23.116 --> 03:38:24.337]  My name is Katie McHugh.
[03:38:24.337 --> 03:38:26.279]  I worked for Breitbart for about three years.
[03:38:26.279 --> 03:38:33.084]  I was a homepage editor, a radio producer, a reporter, copy editor, you know, sort of a jack-of-all-trades.
[03:38:33.084 --> 03:38:38.088]  And I worked very closely with Steve Bannon, and that was an incredible experience.
[03:38:38.088 --> 03:38:48.237]  However, the company has certainly changed since he left because he was, his personality was the driving force behind, you know, nationalist populist movement and Breitbart News itself.
[03:38:49.617 --> 03:38:53.138]  And you helped him with his XM radio show, right?
[03:38:53.138 --> 03:38:57.580]  Yes, he picked me out of everyone in the company.
[03:38:57.580 --> 03:38:59.841]  And I said it was a great honor.
[03:38:59.841 --> 03:39:04.863]  So it was so great to work for a boss who was, you know, total pedal to the metal.
[03:39:04.863 --> 03:39:08.785]  Everything he did was for the audience, for the callers, for our readers.
[03:39:08.785 --> 03:39:12.506]  And at the same time, we were totally ideologically aligned.
[03:39:12.506 --> 03:39:14.287]  So what is that like a little bit?
[03:39:14.287 --> 03:39:16.688]  What is it like working with somebody like Steve Bannon?
[03:39:18.140 --> 03:39:19.020]  Steve is always on.
[03:39:19.020 --> 03:39:21.101]  I think he sleeps about two hours a night.
[03:39:21.101 --> 03:39:26.123]  So, you know, him and Trump both have that kind of extremely high energy kind of lifestyle.
[03:39:26.123 --> 03:39:28.924]  You know, Trump himself sleeps about four hours a night.
[03:39:28.924 --> 03:39:32.646]  Steve would get up at 2 a.m., work on show prep for four hours.
[03:39:32.646 --> 03:39:35.107]  I would get up at 5 a.m., immediately mail him the show clock.
[03:39:35.567 --> 03:39:36.368]  That's all before 10 a.m.
[03:39:52.751 --> 03:39:54.552]  And some people haven't even woken up by then.
[03:39:54.552 --> 03:39:59.056]  So, and Steve, Steve is just absolutely brilliant.
[03:39:59.056 --> 03:40:08.263]  Has so much vision and he keeps his promises too, because you can see in the White House, he still has that whiteboard up left of everything he wants to accomplish in Trump's first term.
[03:40:08.263 --> 03:40:10.785]  And he keeps track of all these things and checks them off.
[03:40:10.785 --> 03:40:12.186]  So he has your back.
[03:40:12.186 --> 03:40:13.187]  He'll never betray you.
[03:40:13.187 --> 03:40:14.909]  And he was just a fabulous boss.
[03:40:15.954 --> 03:40:19.836]  So I'm glad that you mentioned that because it is fake news.
[03:40:19.836 --> 03:40:27.981]  The fake news narrative of Steve Bannon is he's some like schlubby guy who just lays around and hides out and doesn't really work.
[03:40:27.981 --> 03:40:30.323]  So you're saying that that's completely fake news?
[03:40:30.967 --> 03:40:32.268]  That is absolutely fake news.
[03:40:32.268 --> 03:40:35.470]  Steve is the hardest working man I've ever met in my life.
[03:40:35.470 --> 03:40:44.395]  And, you know, just because he's not in front of the camera all the time, you know, doing press briefings, doesn't mean that he's just sitting around on his butt, you know, not helping to make America great again.
[03:40:44.395 --> 03:40:45.375]  That's totally false.
[03:40:45.375 --> 03:40:46.236]  Totally fake news.
[03:40:47.625 --> 03:40:54.851]  Yeah, I'm so glad you say that because a lot of people don't appreciate, too, how much work and preparation and everything goes in.
[03:40:54.851 --> 03:40:59.676]  You know, somebody like Alex Jones or somebody like Steve Bannon, you don't just show up and talk.
[03:40:59.676 --> 03:41:06.962]  You have to be addicted and it has to be kind of like your life passion or life purpose or you're going to burn out.
[03:41:06.962 --> 03:41:09.805]  And Steve definitely has always had that vision, hasn't he?
[03:41:10.663 --> 03:41:13.785]  Yes, he has, and you know, the company was his life.
[03:41:13.785 --> 03:41:28.713]  And even just producing the radio show with him, you know, you had to be, you're up at five, you're working on the show, you're following up with callers who call into the show with news tips, you're thinking of the next guest for the next day while tracking the news cycle, trying to plan the flow for the show.
[03:41:28.713 --> 03:41:30.594]  So yeah, you had to be on all the time.
[03:41:30.594 --> 03:41:37.218]  And I just find all these descriptions in the fake news media, Steve is like some slovenly person, just despicable.
[03:41:37.218 --> 03:41:38.099]  They're very offensive.
[03:41:39.059 --> 03:41:41.741]  He's also an avid reader, isn't he?
[03:41:41.741 --> 03:41:43.342]  Yes, he is always reading.
[03:41:43.342 --> 03:41:45.523]  And like Trump, his mind is plastic.
[03:41:45.523 --> 03:41:46.884]  He never stops learning.
[03:41:46.884 --> 03:41:49.145]  And he's always digesting new books.
[03:41:49.145 --> 03:41:53.367]  And when I was producing the show with him, we were getting constant inflow of new books.
[03:41:53.367 --> 03:41:57.670]  And so my reading expanded voraciously while working for him.
[03:41:57.670 --> 03:42:04.914]  So it's amazing because while he's doing all this work, he still takes like an hour or so every day to read something new, learn something new.
[03:42:05.395 --> 03:42:09.567]  And I think that's a great model for all of us, you know, all of us Patriots.
[03:42:09.567 --> 03:42:11.553]  That's something that, you know, that's a habit we should have.
[03:42:12.543 --> 03:42:24.426]  Yeah, and that's one story that has actually really bothered me, is that Steve Bannon is one of the few actual public intellectuals that we have, and conservative media never gave him his credit.
[03:42:24.426 --> 03:42:40.849]  They would talk about William F. Buckley, or, you know, Rich Lowry's not an intellectual, he's not an interesting person, nobody at National Review is doing anything interesting, but there was never a media narrative about Steve Bannon giving him the credit he deserves as probably one of the most
[03:42:41.230 --> 03:42:43.098]  Great right-wing intellectuals of our time.
[03:42:44.218 --> 03:42:45.198]  Oh, I totally agree.
[03:42:45.198 --> 03:42:51.000]  And I think, you know, they're making the same mistake as Trump by trying to call him, like, unkept and lazy.
[03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:53.940]  You know, because Steve is, you know, Steve's a genius.
[03:42:53.940 --> 03:42:56.001]  And he is, he's a predator.
[03:42:56.001 --> 03:42:59.862]  And so I think they're just drastically underestimating him and that's going to hurt them.
[03:42:59.862 --> 03:43:06.543]  I also think it's interesting, too, that I think Steve is the only person who's gotten in trouble and bad press for his reading lists.
[03:43:06.543 --> 03:43:10.764]  I've never seen the press go after someone for reading books that they didn't like.
[03:43:10.764 --> 03:43:13.745]  So, you know, they want to even censor that and make sure that, you know,
[03:43:14.245 --> 03:43:17.510]  Patriots like us can't connect and can't even just share book ideas.
[03:43:18.703 --> 03:43:37.093]  Yeah, it was interesting that the media was triggered that he was reading a book called The Best and the Brightest, which is an ironically titled book because the people that we consider the best and the brightest during the Vietnam era, all the Harvard kids, Yale kids, Ivy Leaguers, they were actually the people who led us to this catastrophic failure in Vietnam.
[03:43:37.093 --> 03:43:41.996]  And we sort of have the same thing going on with the neocons and the Harvard kids.
[03:43:41.996 --> 03:43:44.197]  Oh, we'll go to Iraq, we'll go to Afghanistan.
[03:43:44.197 --> 03:43:47.419]  The people that we view as the best and the brightest, the so-called elite,
[03:43:48.087 --> 03:43:57.990]  They aren't elite at all, so the media was really triggered that he was reading a book, because they view themselves as the best and the brightest, even though they're not unique or interesting at all.
[03:43:57.990 --> 03:43:59.891]  I mean, you work in DC media.
[03:43:59.891 --> 03:44:03.712]  Is it true that they all kind of think alike and they're kind of boring to hang out with?
[03:44:04.577 --> 03:44:04.957]  Yeah, they are.
[03:44:04.957 --> 03:44:09.859]  And you can see this play on Twitter, too, where all the little blue checks are retweeting each other, making snarky comments.
[03:44:09.859 --> 03:44:11.940]  You know, it's all just a game to them.
[03:44:11.940 --> 03:44:15.061]  Steve is a very serious person, which is why, you know, he's reading it.
[03:44:15.061 --> 03:44:20.964]  And I think that offends the media because they realize that they're being shown up by someone who works much harder than them, is much smarter than them.
[03:44:22.430 --> 03:44:27.093]  That's why they hate Alex, too, is they want to dismiss him as, you know, whatever.
[03:44:27.093 --> 03:44:29.254]  But he's always on.
[03:44:29.254 --> 03:44:30.675]  You know, he never stops thinking.
[03:44:30.675 --> 03:44:36.859]  So we need, you know, we need more positive attention to the virtues of these kind of public figures.
[03:44:36.859 --> 03:44:39.761]  And again, that's a story that is incumbent upon us to tell.
[03:44:39.761 --> 03:44:42.903]  So you had mentioned Steve had a killer instinct.
[03:44:42.903 --> 03:44:44.144]  Now, here's what I've heard.
[03:44:44.144 --> 03:44:47.526]  And I'm going to I'm going to qualify this for all the drama mongers at home.
[03:44:48.326 --> 03:44:50.447]  I want Breitbart to succeed.
[03:44:50.447 --> 03:44:52.688]  I am happy Breitbart exists.
[03:44:52.688 --> 03:44:57.631]  I have linked to Breitbart and sent probably at least a million clicks to their site.
[03:44:57.631 --> 03:45:00.393]  I am not hating on or shading Breitbart.
[03:45:00.393 --> 03:45:03.694]  However, as a journalist, I will tell you what I have heard.
[03:45:03.694 --> 03:45:08.297]  I have heard that once Bannon left, Breitbart is now being run by lawyers.
[03:45:09.557 --> 03:45:10.938]  Yes, that's true.
[03:45:10.938 --> 03:45:13.659]  And I want Breitbart to succeed as well.
[03:45:13.659 --> 03:45:16.600]  I want to go back to Andrew's vision and I want to have Steve's energy.
[03:45:16.600 --> 03:45:18.501]  I really wish them all the best.
[03:45:18.501 --> 03:45:26.565]  However, I think that they're nervous about the intense media scrutiny on them since Steve, of course, went to go work for Trump and his White House chief strategist.
[03:45:26.565 --> 03:45:30.327]  So they stopped following up on critical narratives that got big play under Steve.
[03:45:30.327 --> 03:45:34.849]  For example, that horrible gang rape of that little disabled girl in Twin Falls, Idaho.
[03:45:35.689 --> 03:45:40.593]  Management did not want to touch stories like that because they are pretty radioactive and they are explosive.
[03:45:40.593 --> 03:45:46.616]  But this is what the people want and this is something that a nationalist populist minded group should discuss.
[03:45:46.616 --> 03:45:50.039]  We should ask about why are these third world refugees here?
[03:45:50.039 --> 03:45:51.480]  Why are they living in slums?
[03:45:51.480 --> 03:45:56.483]  Why are they giving cheap labor to you know different factories and while little girls are getting raped?
[03:45:57.023 --> 03:45:57.924]  Do we vote for this?
[03:45:57.924 --> 03:45:58.764]  Do we ask for this?
[03:45:58.764 --> 03:46:00.866]  Why don't communities have any control over that?
[03:46:00.866 --> 03:46:06.309]  And it's just surprising to me that Breitbart is shying away from that kind of critical discussion.
[03:46:06.309 --> 03:46:07.250]  Why do you think that is?
[03:46:08.550 --> 03:46:16.914]  I think because, well, in the case of the Chobani yogurt factory, which is located near Twin Falls, the person running it is of Turkish descent.
[03:46:16.914 --> 03:46:23.517]  I think he's a citizen, he was naturalized, and he likes hiring a lot of these refugees on the cheap to keep producing his yogurt.
[03:46:23.517 --> 03:46:34.583]  However, a lot of these people are very litigious, and I just think Breitbart has, you know, a lot to worry about right now with their advertisers, things like that, and they don't want an expensive lawsuit, you know, to come crashing down their heads.
[03:46:35.785 --> 03:46:48.750]  I've also heard too, and this is the way I interpret it as run by lawyers, as a lawyer myself and working with lawyers, if you want to be told why you can't do something, then ask a lawyer for advice.
[03:46:48.750 --> 03:46:53.331]  If you say, I want to start a media company, they'll give you 10 reasons why it's a bad idea.
[03:46:53.331 --> 03:46:55.072]  Lawyers are not visionaries.
[03:46:55.072 --> 03:47:00.754]  Lawyers are risk averse and they focus on that 1% of the risk and say, well you better
[03:47:01.474 --> 03:47:05.715]  You better not take the shot because there's this downside risk that maybe he was only 1%.
[03:47:05.715 --> 03:47:13.617]  So I interpreted Breitbart as run by lawyers to mean that they don't want to take big risks anymore.
[03:47:13.617 --> 03:47:14.497]  That's exactly right.
[03:47:14.497 --> 03:47:19.178]  And there's nothing wrong with that mindset, but that's dramatically different than what Steve did.
[03:47:19.178 --> 03:47:27.240]  You know, I can't see Breitbart with a kind of, you know, truly, like I said, killer instinct right now because they are concerned about so much risk.
[03:47:29.006 --> 03:47:31.067]  And the story, so what was like the assignment?
[03:47:31.067 --> 03:47:34.688]  Like I know for a fact that they had a major story.
[03:47:34.688 --> 03:47:36.608]  I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna scoop them.
[03:47:36.608 --> 03:47:42.070]  But I know for a fact that they had a major story that would have sent shockwaves.
[03:47:42.070 --> 03:47:43.770]  It's a national security story.
[03:47:43.770 --> 03:47:47.691]  It would have sent shockwaves all through D.C.
[03:47:47.691 --> 03:47:50.672]  and they decided not to run it.
[03:47:50.672 --> 03:47:53.693]  Are big time stories getting killed inside Breitbart?
[03:47:54.448 --> 03:48:00.032]  Well Breitbart had an approval process and some stories would just inexplicably never get approved.
[03:48:00.032 --> 03:48:01.394]  They sit there for hours.
[03:48:01.394 --> 03:48:12.663]  Even simple things like I was trying to write up an FBI report, an internal report, not classified, that came out saying that the media is directly responsible for these executions of cops in the streets.
[03:48:13.243 --> 03:48:18.025]  You know, there's 50, 60 cops that were murdered, you know, in 2016, 2015.
[03:48:18.025 --> 03:48:24.427]  And a lot of these were from people who were ginned up by media reports on Ferguson, you know, etc.
[03:48:24.427 --> 03:48:27.088]  And they would just go out and they would shoot a cop.
[03:48:27.088 --> 03:48:35.151]  But Breitbart didn't want to touch that because it did have, you know, the FBI did talk about like the racial element of, you know, the black man getting shot by the white cop.
[03:48:35.851 --> 03:48:42.557]  Um, and they just decided, well, there's 1% chance that this could be a backlash on us, so we're just not going to run the story.
[03:48:42.557 --> 03:48:44.579]  So yes, they have killed a lot of stories.
[03:48:44.579 --> 03:48:55.488]  And one thing I encourage our listeners to do is go to leestraininghandsofthepopulous.tv for some of the stories, especially on, you know, the SPLC, the Frankfurt School, the Twin Falls narrative that Breitbart killed.
[03:48:57.170 --> 03:49:03.253]  Yeah, and I'd also heard, too, that there was a meeting, and this is a direct quote that I got from one of my sources.
[03:49:03.253 --> 03:49:06.094]  Somebody at the meeting had said, we want to be more like The Hill.
[03:49:06.094 --> 03:49:11.616]  Is that anything that you heard or culturally you felt was happening?
[03:49:11.616 --> 03:49:12.657]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:49:12.657 --> 03:49:17.039]  And, you know, there's a time and a place for that, but Breitbart's trying to be all things to all people, and it's not going to work.
[03:49:17.819 --> 03:49:23.703]  And, you know, they've said publicly, we want to become the right wing version of the New York Times.
[03:49:23.703 --> 03:49:25.144]  Well, you're Breitbart.
[03:49:25.144 --> 03:49:29.467]  And I feel like they're trying to run away from the legacy and the reputation that gave them their success.
[03:49:29.467 --> 03:49:30.428]  And I think it's a mistake.
[03:49:31.545 --> 03:49:37.886]  And that's exactly why I told a lot of my friends at Breitbart, I said, you're not going to out hill the hill.
[03:49:37.886 --> 03:49:40.327]  You're not going to out politico politico.
[03:49:40.327 --> 03:49:48.028]  Your value proposition is that you're covering news and information that nobody else in the mainstream media is going to cover.
[03:49:48.028 --> 03:49:50.108]  That's your value proposition.
[03:49:50.108 --> 03:49:51.608]  That's what people go to your website for.
[03:49:51.608 --> 03:49:52.509]  That's what they expect.
[03:49:52.509 --> 03:49:59.950]  And if all they're going to get is another saccharine basic talking point on the story of the day that they can find at the hill of the politico.
[03:50:00.572 --> 03:50:01.740]  Then why go to Breitbart?
[03:50:02.583 --> 03:50:03.303]  Exactly.
[03:50:03.303 --> 03:50:09.206]  And becoming the right-wing version of the Huffington Post, you know, you're not distinguishing yourself from the herd.
[03:50:09.206 --> 03:50:16.890]  And Spriteboard should be pursuing these stories, these, you know, hot-button stories that maybe other legacy media will touch, and ridicule them for covering, too.
[03:50:16.890 --> 03:50:24.074]  We always get ridiculed for covering illegal alien crime, even though it's 100% preventable, and it's something that people care about.
[03:50:24.074 --> 03:50:26.475]  So I really hope that they return to their old legacy.
[03:50:26.475 --> 03:50:31.158]  They realize that, you know, the direction they're going in is a mistake, and I just wish them all the success in the world.
[03:50:31.974 --> 03:50:36.999]  Well, I think I don't want to get my facts wrong, so correct me if I'm wrong.
[03:50:36.999 --> 03:50:45.829]  Didn't Ian Coulter have her column serialized at Breitbart and they cut out a link that she had included to a map of violence against Trump supporters?
[03:50:46.601 --> 03:50:59.348]  Yes, Ann's column on how leftists want to kill us, which is frighteningly true, had a link to American Renaissance, which is a white advocacy group, very famous, was founded in 1990.
[03:50:59.348 --> 03:51:01.930]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[03:51:01.930 --> 03:51:03.731]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[03:51:04.071 --> 03:51:06.032]  Are you happy paying high prices?

[03:52:03.570 --> 03:52:04.010]  Great!

[03:52:22.567 --> 03:52:24.149]  Which Nutra-Certical does he like best?
[03:52:24.409 --> 03:52:27.970]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[03:52:27.970 --> 03:52:28.350]  That's amazing.
[03:52:28.350 --> 03:52:29.270]  That's really incredible.
[03:52:29.270 --> 03:52:32.391]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:52:32.391 --> 03:52:33.791]  Like, I haven't fell asleep.
[03:52:33.791 --> 03:52:35.472]  My morning was fantastic.

[03:54:19.822 --> 03:54:21.142]  It's been a great conversation.
[03:54:21.142 --> 03:54:24.503]  We're talking about journalism, the future of media.
[03:54:24.503 --> 03:54:29.785]  Before we finish the segment off, I want to remind you tonight, the Trump Hotel, 7 p.m.
[03:54:29.785 --> 03:54:31.106]  Washington, D.C.
[03:54:31.106 --> 03:54:32.226]  We're having a MAGA meetup.
[03:54:32.606 --> 03:54:33.567]  Come on out.
[03:54:33.567 --> 03:54:37.389]  Follow the MAGAMEETUPS account.
[03:54:37.389 --> 03:54:38.870]  MAGA Meetups account.
[03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:41.671]  Connect with like-minded fellow Patriots.
[03:54:41.671 --> 03:54:42.632]  We're everywhere.
[03:54:42.632 --> 03:54:43.452]  You're not alone.
[03:54:43.452 --> 03:54:44.533]  It's such a lie.
[03:54:44.533 --> 03:54:47.374]  I'm so tired of being treated like some kind of fringe group.
[03:54:47.374 --> 03:54:48.255]  Like we don't belong.
[03:54:48.755 --> 03:54:50.017]  Like we're outcasts.
[03:54:50.017 --> 03:54:51.438]  We are the mainstream.
[03:54:51.438 --> 03:54:52.540]  We are the majority.
[03:54:52.540 --> 03:54:54.622]  We're taking back what is rightfully us.
[03:54:54.622 --> 03:54:55.583]  We're the good guys.
[03:54:55.583 --> 03:54:57.806]  We gotta quit acting like we're in the shadows.
[03:54:57.806 --> 03:55:02.491]  Because these liberal medias, these pedophiles, threatening assassination.
[03:55:02.491 --> 03:55:05.275]  Seth Rogen's mocking a guy who was stabbed seven times.
[03:55:05.915 --> 03:55:08.138]  In the chest saying, oh, ha ha ha.
[03:55:08.138 --> 03:55:09.921]  I hope that guy has health insurance.
[03:55:09.921 --> 03:55:11.062]  He doesn't, but I do.
[03:55:11.062 --> 03:55:12.524]  He's going to have to go fund me.
[03:55:12.524 --> 03:55:16.169]  They're making fun of anybody who doesn't have the kind of money that they have.
[03:55:16.169 --> 03:55:19.172]  Johnny Depp advocating the assassination of President Trump.
[03:55:19.172 --> 03:55:20.694]  Madonna threatening to kill Trump.
[03:55:20.694 --> 03:55:21.736]  Kathy Griffin.
[03:55:22.336 --> 03:55:27.060]  All these pedophiles in the media, the pedophiles in the DNC, they won't hand over their server.
[03:55:27.060 --> 03:55:29.182]  They are the pedophiles.
[03:55:29.182 --> 03:55:30.843]  They are the people covering things up.
[03:55:30.843 --> 03:55:32.064]  They are the murderers.
[03:55:32.064 --> 03:55:33.445]  They are the psychopaths.
[03:55:33.445 --> 03:55:34.766]  They are the reptiles.
[03:55:34.766 --> 03:55:38.489]  So it is time for us to show up in public.
[03:55:38.489 --> 03:55:39.951]  We're not hiding anymore.
[03:55:39.951 --> 03:55:46.216]  We're not going to let the streets belong to these vile, disgusting, wicked, duplicitous, demonic people.
[03:55:46.736 --> 03:55:50.498]  Tonight, Trump Hotel, 7 p.m., host your own MAGA meetup.
[03:55:50.498 --> 03:55:55.920]  We're also having a protest, not a protest, a rally against political violence.
[03:55:55.920 --> 03:56:00.982]  We're going to do that in front of the White House, Washington, D.C., this Sunday at noon.
[03:56:00.982 --> 03:56:04.984]  I do believe N4 Wars will be live streaming, but I will double check that.
[03:56:04.984 --> 03:56:07.285]  And so watch the live stream if you can't make it.
[03:56:07.285 --> 03:56:09.646]  If you're near D.C., come on out.
[03:56:09.646 --> 03:56:10.587]  I'll be there.
[03:56:10.587 --> 03:56:11.327]  Jack will be there.
[03:56:11.327 --> 03:56:12.567]  Roger Stone will be there.
[03:56:12.567 --> 03:56:16.009]  Cassandra, a lot of great people, a lot of fellow patriots.
[03:56:16.449 --> 03:56:18.270]  Are going to be there.
[03:56:18.270 --> 03:56:22.772]  Katie McHugh, what is the future of conservative media?
[03:56:22.772 --> 03:56:24.954]  Alex wants to do a massive expansion.
[03:56:24.954 --> 03:56:28.896]  He had told me who is on your wish list of people.
[03:56:28.896 --> 03:56:30.096]  And I had mentioned a few names.
[03:56:30.096 --> 03:56:32.378]  I'm not going to go, you know, over all of them.
[03:56:32.378 --> 03:56:36.880]  But I'd say that I think Katie McHugh is one of like the greatest talents right now in media.
[03:56:36.880 --> 03:56:44.404]  So what is your advice for the future of right wing media, conservative media, whatever, populist media, nationalist media, whatever it is that we want to call it?
[03:56:45.185 --> 03:56:49.127]  I would say absolutely be happy warriors and stay engaged with your audience.
[03:56:49.127 --> 03:56:56.792]  What you and Alex are sponsoring, these MAGA meetups, are so important because the media does try to make you feel ashamed, alone, atomized, cut off from everyone else.
[03:56:56.792 --> 03:56:58.593]  They do not want us to practice freedom of speech.
[03:56:58.593 --> 03:57:01.514]  They do not want us to practice freedom of assembly.
[03:57:01.514 --> 03:57:04.236]  They want us scared and alone and separated from each other.
[03:57:04.236 --> 03:57:10.920]  So I think the future of conservative media will be bringing readers together in physical space to get together and form a real movement.
[03:57:11.860 --> 03:57:13.665]  So what would that look like?
[03:57:13.665 --> 03:57:15.629]  Brainstorming the idea, what would that look like?
[03:57:16.496 --> 03:57:22.259]  Well, I think having spontaneous MAGA meetups across the country is a great idea because it all starts in the community.
[03:57:22.259 --> 03:57:29.003]  I think that all of us patriots should be rooted leaders in our communities and be connected with each other across the country.
[03:57:29.003 --> 03:57:44.452]  So, you know, in your hometown, you can just say, all Trump supporters, let's get coffee on this morning, you know, Sunday morning after church and just, you know, keep building community and keep making strong ties and don't let the media, you know, gaslight you into thinking you're alone and there's something wrong with you.
[03:57:45.707 --> 03:57:51.632]  And also, we need more people doing YouTubes, Twitter, social media, even, you know, even if it's on knitting.
[03:57:51.632 --> 03:57:54.855]  We need all Patriots to just kind of be out there and to unite.
[03:57:54.855 --> 03:57:58.438]  So I want to give you the last sort of 30 to 45 seconds.
[03:57:58.438 --> 03:57:59.479]  What is new in media?
[03:57:59.479 --> 03:58:00.319]  What is going on?
[03:58:00.319 --> 03:58:03.262]  What do the Patriots listening need to do?
[03:58:03.262 --> 03:58:09.387]  I think that everyone should follow your model and Jack Pasobiak's model of getting on Twitter, getting on Facebook, and doing periscopes.
[03:58:10.851 --> 03:58:14.153]  We need to get in their faces, legally and lawfully.
[03:58:14.153 --> 03:58:15.494]  More of that takeover.
[03:58:15.494 --> 03:58:17.915]  Thanks so much, Katie, for your time.
[03:58:17.915 --> 03:58:23.338]  It was a pleasure talking to you and I hope to see you at one of these MAGA meetups one of these days.
[03:58:23.338 --> 03:58:24.458]  Thank you so much, Mike.
[03:58:24.458 --> 03:58:25.799]  I really appreciate it.
[03:58:25.799 --> 03:58:26.580]  My pleasure.
[03:58:26.580 --> 03:58:27.960]  So you just heard from Katie McHugh.
[03:58:27.960 --> 03:58:33.423]  She's a great up and coming rising star and a star in her own right in right wing media.
[03:58:33.423 --> 03:58:36.965]  Everybody, thank you so much for listening in and thank you so much for your support.
[03:58:36.965 --> 03:58:38.066]  I will see you next Friday.
