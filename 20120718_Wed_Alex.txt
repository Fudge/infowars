[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:39.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  If you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own.
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.000]  I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart.
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.000]  There are a lot of smart people out there.
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  It must be because I worked harder than everybody else.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.000]  Let me tell you something.
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  There are a whole bunch of hard-working people out there.
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help.
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  There was a great teacher somewhere in your life.
[01:05.000 --> 01:14.000]  Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we had that allowed you to thrive.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  Somebody invested in roads and bridges.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  If you got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  The Internet didn't get invented on its own.
[01:25.000 --> 01:31.000]  Government research created the Internet, so then all the companies couldn't make money off the Internet.
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  If you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own.
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  Okay, so there you go.
[01:36.000 --> 01:48.000]  The philosophy of Hugo Chavez, of Lenin, of Stalin, of all of them, written large in all of our faces.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  Just period.
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  You are a bitter clinger that you want your Bible and your gun and your family.
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  And government is the reason you have a business and you have a life.
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  And that's America.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  America is all about swarms of bureaucracies sent out to eat out our substance.
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  America used the communist manifesto.
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  And that's why the police and military are taught the founding fathers are bad,
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  but the Declaration of Independence and Constitution are bad,
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  because these documents are under inherent attack now.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.000]  And everywhere the big government types are in control.
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.000]  Chicago, New York, LA, the society is collapsing, which is what they want.
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  They want to get you dependent.
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.000]  This is part of an economic revolution to bankrupt this country scientifically.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  It is Wednesday, the 18th day of July, 2012.
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  And we are going to be live here for the next three hours.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  Coming up in the second hour, former State Senator John DeKamp,
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  who did write about the connections to Penn State and child abuse in the 90s.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  I had forgotten that he talked about this.
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.000]  Then I saw a red dirt report a few days ago with quotes where he'd been talking about it years ago.
[03:09.000 --> 03:22.000]  Just amazing, the massive child abuse network ring at the highest levels of the Republican Party.
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  He was hired as a big Republican in the state of Nebraska to go basically investigate it and cover it up.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  They didn't say, hey, it's real, go cover it up.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  It was, hey, this is a bunch of bulls, Senator DeKamp, go prove it's bull.
[03:34.000 --> 03:41.000]  And so the police investigator, he hired the detective, well-known detective.
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  He and his son's plane was blown up when flying to Chicago to investigate.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  And the rest, there were indictments, there were convictions.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  The fed swooped in and covered it all up.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  So you know about the Catholic Church, know about Penn State.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  I mean, what about the Texas Youth Commission?
[03:55.000 --> 04:02.000]  All the major youth facilities with gladiatorial fighting, the jail guards selling even 10-year-old children out
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  and the juvenile correctional facilities to police and judges and people coming in
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  and other wealthy who were part of the pervert club, part of the demon club
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  to have their way with children all over Texas.
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.000]  The Texas Rangers found out and tried to stop it, they got told it back off.
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  The head of the DPS refused to kill the investigation, he was just removed.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  So the pedophiles rule Texas as well.
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  So they call the shots and they're everywhere.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  They like to get into government controls, it's the only place they can operate
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  with basically diplomatic immunity like the UN.
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  They don't really have it, but technically, but in reality they do.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  And so they hunt us, they hunt our children.
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  They are tearing up our society under Agenda 21, tearing out our roads,
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000]  destroying our society, trying to collapse our cities so that we'll be under their control.
[04:56.000 --> 05:25.000]  It is the Hunger Games model.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  It's a model that can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  Easy to set up and use, doesn't require electricity.
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds and wells.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  It's what my family uses.
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on propure,
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  but if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off.
[05:53.000 --> 06:00.000]  And Infowars.com, you can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[06:23.000 --> 06:30.000]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.000]  And here's the best part.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[06:41.000 --> 06:48.000]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.000]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[06:57.000 --> 07:26.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[08:22.000 --> 08:37.000]  There is a clip that has been making the rounds since this weekend when President Barack Obama gave the speech,
[08:37.000 --> 08:40.000]  and it's the standard speech he's giving all over the country.
[08:40.000 --> 08:48.000]  This is off of a teleprompter complete with the fake pausing and occasional halting and stuttering he does
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  to make it look like he's actually genuine in giving a real speech.
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.000]  And Comrade Obama praised the state ungrateful individualist heathen.
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.000]  He said, if you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.
[09:03.000 --> 09:10.000]  He went on to say government research created the internet so that all the companies could make money off the internet.
[09:10.000 --> 09:22.000]  Funny, I thought Al Gore created it in 1990 as a senator, even though it was around in the 60s.
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  And at first it was government sending itself little messages.
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  And then people starting in the 80s began to get on it, began buying hardware and adding to it,
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.000]  building their own servers and paying for the telecoms to give them rack space.
[09:41.000 --> 09:50.000]  And we the people built what is the internet today and the millions of programmers and code writers and artists
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  and people that created the websites and the journalists and the people taking photos and people doing videos.
[09:56.000 --> 10:06.000]  That's what built the giant online communication slash market compendium that is the internet.
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.000]  And what government did, Eisenhower warned us about the fact that at that time in 1961,
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.000]  and it's very well addressed, over 90%, around 91% of all research public and private was being funded by government.
[10:20.000 --> 10:27.000]  There was always that research going on before in America and Europe and powering the industrial revolution.
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  Governments began taking taxpayer money to control development of technology.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  We'd probably be 100 years ahead if it wasn't for them.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  A lot of futurists and scientists have broken down the numbers.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  They've been suppressing technology, it allows big combines that control government,
[10:42.000 --> 10:49.000]  special interest to use government regulators to shut down what they call disruptive technologies.
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  I've talked to drug company heads.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  I mean, I'm talking about people worth hundreds of millions of dollars a piece that run billion-dollar companies.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  And they've explained, oh yeah, we have drugs that'll cure this, cure that,
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.000]  but it's never approved because it's seen as a disruptive technology.
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  There's all sorts of better treatments for cancer, in some cases cures,
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  but you're never going to get access to it because it's a disruptive technology,
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.000]  disruptive to the monopolies and the social engineering.
[11:21.000 --> 11:29.000]  And so they get up there and they say, everything is government, everything.
[11:29.000 --> 11:36.000]  Now what government has become is a big monopolistic system for a very small cadre of global corporations
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.000]  who are setting up a global corporate fascist government in their own words.
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  They admit it is authoritarian. I mean, the editor of the Financial Times of London.
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  He's their foreign editor. He went to Bilderberg this year.
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  He's written multiple articles saying, yeah, it's world government.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  In fact, one's called Time for World Government and Now for World Government.
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  And he says, we're authoritarian, we were secretive, we run your life, so take it.
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  Head of the Kissinger Group, Rothkopf wrote a book, superclass, saying the same thing.
[12:07.000 --> 12:15.000]  That's what's frustrating is they all sit there and write books about how they've set up
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  a private corporate world government that's anti-free market, monopolistic,
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  and then congratulate themselves that they were able to take over.
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.000]  So that's the evidence that they should be in charge is survival of the fittest
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.000]  while they send out Obama to push communism and socialism at the grassroots.
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  But that only means taken from people making 125,000 or a quarter million collectively
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  the husband and wife a year, not to give it to the poor people.
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.000]  See, they're bankrupting the country, doubling the amount of people on welfare roles
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.000]  or surviving off a check in the last four years since the design implosion.
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  And then they devalue the dollar so those checks won't buy anything anymore.
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  They let government take over the healthcare.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  So yeah, you get, quote, government, quote, free healthcare,
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  but it's watered down and is basically eugenics.
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.000]  And you try to communicate that to a dumbed-down population of people
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  that all they know about is American Idol.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  They just don't understand it.
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.000]  It's like with Mitt Romney just giving rhetoric and red meat to conservatives.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  It isn't what he'll actually do if he got in office.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  Down at the NAACP in Houston said, look, we're going to have to cut non-essential programs
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  like shrimp on treadmills.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  I'm not joking.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  They spent millions on shrimp on treadmills.
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.000]  If you think I'm joking, the federal government paid for that.
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  You know, illegal aliens get better in-state tuition in most states than citizens.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  They basically get free education.
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  Things like that, of course, Romney would never actually cut that
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  when he was actually a governor.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  He was all for it because that's what the globalists want and that's what they get.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  They want to bankrupt things.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  They want to create a dependent class.
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  And the NAACP, when he said, we need to get rid of Obamacare, they booed him.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  We're going to play that later coming up.
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  But this is the type of issue, and there it is, tax dollars fund shrimp on treadmills,
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  Jell-O wrestling in Antarctica.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  And you're like, well, that's silly.
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  What's the point?
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  I mean, it's silly to have Obama come out and say,
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  I don't like people clutching their Bibles and their guns
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  because he knows he's deindustrializing them.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  And it's the last thing.
[14:22.000 --> 14:23.000]  That's what they hate.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  The state is not God because you have the Bible.
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  Whether Obama believes the Bible is real or not,
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  whether you believe it's real or not,
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  if that's God to you, it isn't the state.
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  And that narrative, that idea, that system is about family and standing up against evil,
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  if you actually read it.
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  So, you know, in a private deal with people giving you,
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  $30,000 a plate four years ago in San Francisco,
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  he says, don't worry, we're going to get these better cleaners.
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  You've heard it.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  They're bitterly clean in their Bibles and their guns.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  You see, that is the enemy.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  We've still got the fact that the government isn't God.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  Collectivism in the Borg system isn't our God.
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  And we've still got guns, and that's what they can't stand.
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  We don't worship them mindlessly and bind everything they say,
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  and we've got guns.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  And those are the final things.
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  They're going to take everything else.
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  Unless you're in a globalist city, like Austin, Texas, where they live,
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  or certain areas of San Francisco, certain areas of Manhattan,
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  then things are going to be boomtown.
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  But everywhere else, except for the high-tech citadels, the high-tech reservations,
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  everything is going to be imploded, and that's their stated goal.
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  Ted Turner, Maury Strong, Prince Charles, Prince Philip,
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  Billa Melinda Gates, all of them.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  They all talk about the post-industrial world.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  Go look it up, because you're going to be on a calorie card.
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.000]  You're going to be tracked everything you do, just like the Hunger Games.
[15:57.000 --> 16:03.000]  That is an in-your-face analogy or parable of what they would like to build.
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.000]  Do you understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  That's what they want.
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  That's what they're creating.
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  That's what they're doing.
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.000]  That's been their plan in the UN Biological Diversity Assessment, 1996.
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  Not the one at the UN website that's redacted.
[16:18.000 --> 16:19.000]  They've expunged it everywhere.
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  You've got to go to the library to get it.
[16:21.000 --> 16:22.000]  I did.
[16:22.000 --> 16:27.000]  The University of Texas Library, and it's in my film, Road to Turning.
[16:27.000 --> 16:28.000]  911, The Road to Turning.
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.000]  Screenshots and blow-ups of them saying they were going to create feudalism again.
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  We will live in rural areas, highly controlled, one child being sterilized.
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.000]  They will live in high-tech command bases.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  That is their plan.
[16:42.000 --> 16:46.000]  Okay, exempt from all the laws they pass on us.
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  This is Agenda 21.
[16:48.000 --> 16:55.000]  So I want to play to you, Obama, at his speech with disdain for all entrepreneurs.
[16:55.000 --> 17:03.000]  This is, again, the majority of government contracts are supposed to go to small companies.
[17:03.000 --> 17:04.000]  None of it does.
[17:04.000 --> 17:05.000]  There's secret blacklist.
[17:05.000 --> 17:06.000]  That's come out.
[17:06.000 --> 17:07.000]  They won't give you contracts.
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  I mean, even if you're going to have a big government, yeah, there were contracts to locals.
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  At least there'd be some jobs.
[17:12.000 --> 17:13.000]  No, no, no.
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.000]  This is all off-source.
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.000]  This is all done by design.
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  This is all designed to bring you economically.
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.000]  This is siege.
[17:19.000 --> 17:26.000]  This is government in the form of siege, study siege, the most ancient form of total warfare.
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.000]  We are under globalist siege.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  Africa is under globalist siege.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  Latin America is under globalist siege.
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.000]  If a country kicks the globalist down, then the you and everybody put sanctions on them.
[17:39.000 --> 17:50.000]  And embargoes and puts US Navy off their coast or NATO military to block even food or medicine coming in.
[17:50.000 --> 17:56.000]  This is total and complete world government in everyone's face.
[17:56.000 --> 18:01.000]  Total and complete world government.
[18:01.000 --> 18:07.000]  A scientific takeover blueprint that is public.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  No quarter will be given, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  They're not going to let you beg them.
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of Obama inditing the American dream.
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  Inditing it and saying government is the answer from which everything.
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  Yeah, a crony government run by offshore banks who happen to be eugenicists.
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  Even if you believe in the mega state, total state, worship the state system.
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.000]  And all the nightmares it creates in history and you're ignorant.
[18:31.000 --> 18:32.000]  Don't you understand?
[18:32.000 --> 18:33.000]  This is a tyranny.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  This is a conversion of the economy.
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  We'll take you out to break with Lord Obama. Here it is.
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  If you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own.
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.000]  I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart.
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  There are a lot of smart people out there.
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  It must be because I worked harder than everybody else.
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.000]  Let me tell you something.
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  There are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.
[18:54.000 --> 19:00.000]  If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help.
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  There was a great teacher somewhere in your life.
[19:04.000 --> 19:11.000]  Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we had that allowed you to thrive.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  Somebody invested in roads and bridges.
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.000]  If you got a business, you didn't build that.
[19:17.000 --> 19:20.000]  Somebody else made that happen.
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  The internet didn't get invented on its own.
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  Government research created the internet.
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  So then all the companies couldn't make money off the internet.
[19:29.000 --> 19:35.000]  Stop right there. Not human research. Not things developed.
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  And then the government put together.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  And then that was deployed.
[19:40.000 --> 19:47.000]  Knowing this technology was coming, they deployed it to make sure they had backdoors in it to control it to make it a tyranny.
[19:47.000 --> 19:54.000]  We're going to come back and run down more of this and really break down just how serious this is.
[19:54.000 --> 20:00.000]  And then we're going to get into all the other incredible news. Stay with us.
[20:24.000 --> 20:30.000]  People who love freedom to meet and to talk and to write and to post information.

[20:32.000 --> 20:36.000]  We are not going to spy on you and sell your data to the New World Order.

[23:33.000 --> 23:38.000]  and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[23:38.000 --> 23:42.000]  Is capitalism always Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book, explains our monetary system.
[23:49.000 --> 23:54.000]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system.
[23:54.000 --> 24:08.000]  800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[24:08.000 --> 24:16.000]  So Obama says that you never built a business, you never did anything.
[24:16.000 --> 24:22.000]  If you are born with talent and skill and apply yourself in a great sculptor or painter,
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.000]  or a great photographer, no, you didn't do that.
[24:27.000 --> 24:34.000]  If I worked probably 18 hours a day for my first 15 years on air,
[24:34.000 --> 24:40.000]  I still work about 12, 13, 14 hours, even when I'm home, I'm working.
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.000]  I didn't foresee the globalists coming, I didn't read their documents, I didn't go to the library,
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  I didn't research, I didn't do anything.
[24:48.000 --> 24:57.000]  I didn't hire people and get sponsors and work hard to build my own media system from the ground up.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  No government did that.
[25:00.000 --> 25:08.000]  And my wife and I didn't get together and work hard and raise our children.
[25:08.000 --> 25:15.000]  My wife and I didn't change diapers, Obama did.
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  I mean, everything is them.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  Everything is them.
[25:21.000 --> 25:28.000]  I remember when SOS, the local environmental group, was taking people's property to turn around and build housing developments on it
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  that they themselves own.
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  I remember being in radio debates with some of the heads of it and some of the city council people
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  and they would look at me when I was at other people's shows, back when I was passing in 96, 97.
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  They'd look at me during the breaks and they'd smile and they'd say, there's nothing you can do, we're taking over and government directs everything.
[25:46.000 --> 25:53.000]  Everything is a planned economy, we know best, we're the reason there's prosperity.
[25:53.000 --> 26:02.000]  And there they were, literally taking ranchers and farmers, I was interviewing, property for the earth, saying you will sell it, imminent domain,
[26:02.000 --> 26:11.000]  three cents on the dollar, and then just five years later, turning around, taking restrictions off, having the former mayor's own development bank,
[26:11.000 --> 26:23.000]  loan the money to developers, and then the very bureaucrats that took the property, moving into $2 million houses in the most beautiful areas outside Austin.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  And you know what, they command the SWAT teams.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  If you don't give your property up, you're dead.
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.000]  They will send them, you will die.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  And you know what, thank God for them.
[26:33.000 --> 26:40.000]  There's nothing like having somebody with a 5,000 acre cattle ranch that's probably worth $100 million or more at the time,
[26:40.000 --> 26:46.000]  you know, being given $2 million for it.
[26:46.000 --> 26:54.000]  And then watching as the restrictions are taken off of it and it's built on hotels, spas, shopping malls, luxury communities.
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  I mean, that government did that.
[26:58.000 --> 27:06.000]  It doesn't matter if, you know, that family's great grandfather moved in there, cleared the trees themselves, started raising cows and goats on it 100 and something years ago.
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  It doesn't matter if they worked their fingers to the bone.
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.000]  It doesn't matter.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.000]  Government took it and then gave it to select insiders.
[27:15.000 --> 27:23.000]  And mafia government is why the grass grows, the sun shines, the birds sing.
[27:23.000 --> 27:30.000]  Those of us that gamble everything to start businesses and operations and that work hard to make sure things happen.
[27:30.000 --> 27:37.000]  And that do the interviews and hire the people and train them on the skills and then put them in positions.
[27:37.000 --> 27:43.000]  And then put reporters on the air and create notoriety and a career for them.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  I get zero credit.
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  I am, in fact, a parasitic piece of filth.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  For demanding more out of people.
[27:53.000 --> 28:01.000]  We're trying to get people to the next level so that they can then go on someday and maybe create their own system.
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  I am bad.
[28:03.000 --> 28:10.000]  Entrepreneurs, trailblazers, builders, inventors are scum.
[28:10.000 --> 28:18.000]  Government taking taxpayer money and buying it all up and then selectively giving it to certain corporations like Google.
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.000]  To then deploy taxpayer funded technology against the taxpayers.
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.000]  That's good.
[28:28.000 --> 28:37.000]  Government taking our tax money when government doesn't have our consent anymore as a 9% approval rating on average Congress does.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  It doesn't matter if they don't have our consent.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  They are God.
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  They are good.
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.000]  We are trash.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  We are filth.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  If you built a business, you didn't build it.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  If you have a successful business, you didn't build it.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  You don't have credit.
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  If you get up, a lot of these little stands that make tacos and fajitas and things.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  I mean, there are little guys around Austin that have got 10, 20 stands apiece now.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  Making millions of dollars a year.
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.000]  I've talked to some of them.
[29:03.000 --> 29:11.000]  People that came to this country with nothing 20 years ago, 5 years ago, start little taco stands.
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.000]  And it's competitive.
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.000]  Whoever has the best tacos starts getting the business.
[29:15.000 --> 29:20.000]  And then suddenly they have 20, 20 taco stands around town.
[29:20.000 --> 29:30.000]  They're hard work getting up at 4 a.m. making the tacos, going out there in the freezing cold or the hot, being bit by mosquitoes, whatever, and doing that.
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  You get no credit.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  You did nothing.
[29:33.000 --> 29:39.000]  Government that takes your money and shakes you down is actually just lovingly caressing you.
[29:39.000 --> 29:45.000]  And they built everything, everything, government.
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  Okay?
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  The American dream is evil.
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  We now have the socialist dream.
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  We're on the march.
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  The empire's on the run.

[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.000]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.000]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.

[33:16.000 --> 33:20.000]  I'm going to run over some other news here quickly.
[33:20.000 --> 33:25.000]  And then I'm going to go to your phone calls and your entrepreneurs.
[33:25.000 --> 33:29.000]  Do you agree that government did it all and you didn't do anything?
[33:29.000 --> 33:34.000]  As Obama said, imagine if somebody told you 10 years ago that an American president,
[33:34.000 --> 33:39.000]  that under that president, the welfare roles would double.
[33:39.000 --> 33:44.000]  And that then we would get to a point where the president looked at you and said,
[33:44.000 --> 33:48.000]  if you have a business, you didn't build it.
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  You're implying that if you have crew or employees, they're not paid.
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.000]  Or that in a free system, they didn't come and seek employment.
[33:56.000 --> 34:03.000]  And again, that's to play employees off against owners by the government.
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.000]  That's the plan here. And this is class warfare.
[34:07.000 --> 34:15.000]  Of course, you know that at a tune of about five to one, the bankers, the corporate welfare,
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.000]  you're never going to hear Mitt Romney talk about corporate welfare.
[34:18.000 --> 34:22.000]  You're never going to hear Rush Limbaugh talk about corporate welfare.
[34:22.000 --> 34:27.000]  You never, every once in a while, they'll talk about crony capitalism in relationship to Democrats,
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  openly giving their friends, here's a billion, here's 500 million,
[34:30.000 --> 34:33.000]  here's a waiver on regulations we passed.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  Because that's why government always goes bad.
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  And the bigger the government, the worse.
[34:38.000 --> 34:44.000]  Because it allows those corrupt influence to get in there through bribery, blackmail, payoffs,
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  sex, everything.
[34:46.000 --> 34:51.000]  Because I mean, if you can get to a senator, a senior senator, they can get your legislation in,
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.000]  they can get it through, they can get you hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts.
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  They can write regulations to shut down your competition and give you a waiver.
[34:59.000 --> 35:05.000]  And these poor welfare class people, they've never worked a real day in their life, many of them.
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  They have no idea. They sit around watching daytime TV all day.
[35:09.000 --> 35:16.000]  With the lawyer ads and the sitcoms and the MTV and, I mean, can you blame them?
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.000]  They don't have a hope in the world of anything.
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.000]  But then there's people who've had their arms and legs blown off in combat.
[35:25.000 --> 35:26.000]  They've got to be on disability.
[35:26.000 --> 35:34.000]  You've got all the people who've got chronic health problems from all the chemical and biological warfare and bad health decisions,
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.000]  who the insurance companies won't insure.
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  And so then that gets thrown on the states that are going bankrupt.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  You've got 35 million illegal aliens bankrupting the system.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  Can you go to Mexico and get free health care?
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  They laugh at you.
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.000]  So the plan is bankrupt the country.
[35:50.000 --> 35:55.000]  And so now we've been bankrupted just off our own $15 trillion they got us into debt on.
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.000]  They've signed us on to $644 trillion, that's a two-year-old number, it's over $700 trillion now,
[36:00.000 --> 36:04.000]  of the $1.5 quadrillion worldwide fake paper.
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.000]  So if I set up a money laundering operation or a counterfeiting operation,
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  and I got the city of Austin to invest in it,
[36:12.000 --> 36:17.000]  and the city of Austin was going to go belly up if they didn't sign on to debt
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  20 times the debt of city of Austin, just an analogy here.
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.000]  And so instead of going to jail, the city of Austin comes out and says,
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.000]  Alex Jones has to run everything now because he signed us on to this fraud.
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  They're in lecture you about how you're going to live under austerity.
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  This is the plan.
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  If we had a free market in health care like we used to have,
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  these new procedures would get approved quicker.
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  People would find out what procedures really worked better.
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.000]  It wouldn't just be a bunch of drug companies running things,
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  shelling you drugs that kill you dead or to hammer or don't even help you,
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  while blocking approval of good drugs,
[36:57.000 --> 37:02.000]  or paying off doctors to tell you about generic drugs that work even better or older drugs.
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.000]  They know all this.
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  This is on record.
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.000]  This is a gamed insider economy, a mafia economy.
[37:10.000 --> 37:11.000]  It's converting to that.
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  So who does the mafia want to shut down?
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  Who do mafias always want to shut down even at the micro level?
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  They want to shut down local businesses they don't control,
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  and they don't like the churches because sometimes the local churches might stand up to them.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  And what does Obama say?
[37:28.000 --> 37:34.000]  He doesn't like bitter clingers who cling their guns in their Bibles,
[37:34.000 --> 37:40.000]  and he doesn't like small business owners because I've done the math.
[37:40.000 --> 37:47.000]  I'm not some, you know, globalist billionaire exempt from all this stuff.
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  And so on average, taxes one way or another,
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  guess what percentage, because I've had my accountant do it, had a CPA do it.
[37:55.000 --> 38:00.000]  Looking at all my numbers, one of the top accounting firms here in Austin
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  is we have first rate accounting now.
[38:02.000 --> 38:03.000]  Five years ago, we didn't.
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  I mean, I've gotten neurotic about it.
[38:05.000 --> 38:14.000]  Guess how much Alex Jones pays in taxes at the end of each year,
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  county, state, federal, Federal Reserve, all of it.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  Guess what I pay?
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  Yes, 56%.
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  And folks, that ain't enough, you understand?
[38:25.000 --> 38:26.000]  It isn't enough.
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  I mean, feudal surfs in Europe on average gave about 10%.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  It's the same number in feudal Japan.
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  10%.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  10%.
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  10% if you grew rice, you gave 10%.
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.000]  If you grew vegetables, if you caught fish, you gave 10%.
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  10%.
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.000]  If you sold those at the market, you got some silver, 10%.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  The tax collector was there at the end of the dock to get the money.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  And there you could argue, you know, they had Japanese, you know,
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.000]  ships out there to stop hon-raiders coming in and pressing
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  and taking with Japanese as slaves.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  That was always the argument for government before.
[39:04.000 --> 39:05.000]  But the government doesn't even do that.
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  It doesn't even protect us now, does it?
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  In fact, they're the globalist raiders shutting down our country.
[39:11.000 --> 39:19.000]  So a feudal surf, a chattel, bondsman, slave to the land, quasi-complete slave,
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  they paid 10%.
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  I paid 56%.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  Google pays 3%.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  General Electric, zero.
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.000]  General Motors, zero.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  Look it up, zero.
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  Zero.
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  The trillions they make offshore never comes back.
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  Tax exempt.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  They write the laws to shut down their competition here domestically
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.000]  and move it to China, Mexico, India, and 160 plus other third-world countries.
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.000]  And then why do you think all over the country, even Forbes has asked the question,
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  why is there a war on lemonade stands?
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  Or they actually arrest people, find them, you name it.
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  Little kids, because the enemy is anybody with a garden,
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  anybody with a little shop.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  Garage sales are being harassed everywhere.
[40:04.000 --> 40:09.000]  Louisiana passed a law last year that you can't use cash in second-hand sales
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  or it's a felony and giant fines.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  The feds now have little teams that go out to garage sales
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.000]  and if you're selling anything that was recalled even 10 years ago,
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  there's giant books of that each year.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  You're selling some toys, some table that was recalled.
[40:22.000 --> 40:28.000]  You get a million-dollar fine and the second offense, 15 million-dollar fine.
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  You think I'm joking?
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  Just type in 15 million-dollar fine for garage sales.
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  AP Reuters Fox.
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  This is the control.
[40:36.000 --> 40:41.000]  Hey, you're a multinational corporation that knowingly puts measles, mumps,
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  and rubella in the shot knowing it's going to make you sick
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.000]  and laughing saying this will make people get scared and take more of the shot
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  which will cause more MMR.
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  So then that all came out.
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  And did they get in trouble?
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  No.
[40:58.000 --> 41:04.000]  I mean, I guess they paid a fine of like 2.5% of their year's gross.
[41:04.000 --> 41:11.000]  What they make in a couple days.
[41:11.000 --> 41:18.000]  When big government outfits get caught doing things.
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  You know, when government gets caught nerve-gassing our own troops
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.000]  and thousands of experiments, killing many of them.
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  Does anybody get in trouble?
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.000]  No, no, no.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  It just comes out later.
[41:31.000 --> 41:32.000]  Or Hillary apologizes.
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  Oh, we're sorry.
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.000]  We had a U.S. aid program where we injected Guatemalan
[41:38.000 --> 41:43.000]  and now sell the Doran children with live syphilis.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  We're sorry.
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.000]  Get me the clip, please, of Romney.
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  So here's Romney acting like a conservative.
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.000]  You know, Wolf and Sheep's clothing there.
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.000]  But at least the, at least the rhetoric's out there to counter it.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  Saying, hey, we're going to go bankrupt.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  We don't need all these, you know, entitlements.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  What about the defense entitlements?
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  Hey, one in seven is on a welfare check.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  One out of four is on social security.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  It's about to be two out of four.
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  Well, they seem like in 10 years it's going to be,
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  it's going to be half the people are on social security
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  because it's an aging population.
[42:21.000 --> 42:22.000]  Just a couple years.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  But if you add it all up,
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  51% survive off a government contract or a government check.
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  That's why old people are like,
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  how can Obama come out and say business owners are bad,
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  you didn't build Jack squat, the state owns you,
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  the states where the milk comes from.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  Milk and honey.
[42:39.000 --> 42:44.000]  Your mama didn't breastfeed you, the state did.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  The state creates wondrous, you know, happiness.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  The state is so good.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  The state is so happy.
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  Look what it did for Detroit.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  You know, don't you love the wasteland?
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  Don't you love North Korea?
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  I mean, Americans on cue when they stage a terror attack
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.000]  will go out and cry on the streets like people in North Korea.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  People in England on cue go out and worship the queen
[43:06.000 --> 43:09.000]  when they tell them to just like it's, you know, North Korea.
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.000]  This is a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  Government, where you have these big governments
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  like Cuba and North Korea,
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  they've got cars from the 1950s,
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  the last cars they were able to buy
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  from the United States or Europe.
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  They can't, the government can't even,
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  can't even make an automobile.
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  But let me tell you what they can do.
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  They've got forced labor camps
[43:32.000 --> 43:34.000]  and they've got crazed eyes, police and military.
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  Ever seen the military and police in North Korea
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  in those films, how crazy-eyed they are?
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  Just totally wild on power trips.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  Same thing in China.
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  They're the worst of society.
[43:44.000 --> 43:45.000]  And you know what?
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.000]  They got fancy uniforms and lots of medals.
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  And they look like total clowns,
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  just like the people running our systems are.
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  You're clowns, you're jokes.
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  You don't intimidate us.
[43:56.000 --> 43:59.000]  You are, you are, you are, you are a disgrace.
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  All the government awards and government parades
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  and shutting down whole cities
[44:04.000 --> 44:05.000]  when Obama was there yesterday.
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  I-35, hours of backed up traffic
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  during rush hour in the afternoon and at night,
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  totally shut down, bedlam.
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  We got video of it from three angles.
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  We're going to show it on the nightly news tonight.
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  Have a full report the next time they got so much footage.
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  I'll be hosting the news tonight.
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  All of this in our face.
[44:23.000 --> 44:24.000]  And this is it.
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.000]  Government delivers Nazi Germany,
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  Soviet Russia, communist China,
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  communist North Korea.
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  Look, I talked to people and business people,
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  and I got somebody working for me,
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  that family had a business with a lot of employees,
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  very successful in Venezuela.
[44:42.000 --> 44:43.000]  And Chavez showed up.
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  Chavez's people showed up.
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  What was it, five years ago,
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.000]  and said, okay, you're not paid anymore.
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.000]  But if you want to keep the property this is on
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  and not have us basically arrest you,
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  you're going to sit here and run this.
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  And these are the people you're going to hire now
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.000]  to run your private school.
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  All the rest of your fired get out of here.
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  The state's taking this over.
[45:08.000 --> 45:11.000]  Oh, man, that's what Obama is getting you ready for.
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.000]  Nationalization of everything.
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  And then what do people do that have businesses?
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  They just say, you know what, you forget it.
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  I'm not going to do this.
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  And everything collapses.
[45:23.000 --> 45:26.000]  That's what they want.
[45:26.000 --> 45:27.000]  That's what they want.
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  They want to be in their little armored citadels
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  where that's all running around here in squalor.
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  That's the plan.
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.000]  Totally destroy the country.
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.000]  Because the globalists hate you more than they even
[45:39.000 --> 45:40.000]  hate the Muslims.
[45:40.000 --> 45:41.000]  And I know there's Muslim extremists,
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  and the globalists fund a lot of them,
[45:43.000 --> 45:44.000]  and I get all the clash of civilizations.
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  But the globalists wrote white papers
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  like the clash of civilizations, PNAC,
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  where they said they were going to radicalize Muslims.
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  The state department admits they did it.
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  And played us off against each other.
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  They don't like the Muslims because you can say
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.000]  what you want with their pro-family.
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  And they're not into porn, and they're not into vaccines,
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  and they're not into fractional reserve banking
[46:05.000 --> 46:06.000]  and money changing.
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  And that's why they've got to be destroyed.
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  The corrupt Saudi Arabian system,
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  it's going to be the model.
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  But if you think the globalists hate the Muslims, folks,
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  they hate us about 100 times more.
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  And look what they've done to us.
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  Culturally, they've even bragged they've done this
[46:20.000 --> 46:24.000]  to us culturally, scientifically wrecking us.
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  I want to talk to a few entrepreneurs.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  If you're an entrepreneur, do you disagree with me?
[46:29.000 --> 46:35.000]  I mean, when you make a film and work two, three jobs,
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  be able to do it, and then become successful,
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.000]  or when you start a restaurant and bust your butt,
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  or when you start selling used cars
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  and then finally get your own dealership,
[46:44.000 --> 46:45.000]  you know, over 20 years,
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  or you're a farmer out there working,
[46:47.000 --> 46:48.000]  I mean, I've worked as a farmer.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  I've worked as for a large animal vet.
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  I've seen other farmers at ranchers work, folks.
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  I was out at Stoner Ranch a few months ago doing a video shoot,
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  and we were leaving at night at night,
[46:59.000 --> 47:01.000]  and there were people out there cutting hay
[47:01.000 --> 47:04.000]  because the hay was ready to come in.
[47:04.000 --> 47:05.000]  You know what?
[47:05.000 --> 47:10.000]  Working 16 hours a day, you didn't do Jack Squat, buddy.
[47:10.000 --> 47:13.000]  Government did.
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.000]  Really, they collectivized the farms of the Soviet Union
[47:15.000 --> 47:19.000]  and the Ukraine in China, and it killed over 100 million people.
[47:19.000 --> 47:21.000]  64 million, conservatively.
[47:21.000 --> 47:23.000]  China says 80 plus million.
[47:23.000 --> 47:25.000]  Our State Department says 64 million.
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.000]  Russians killed over 40 million over two decades.
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.000]  In one year, they killed 10 million Ukrainians,
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  and you're like, man, that's a, no, no, no,
[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  it was done on purpose.
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  Lenin wrote it was done on purpose
[47:37.000 --> 47:40.000]  because it's what they like to do.
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.000]  All big governments are bad, crazy people,
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  and they always want to wear black uniforms.
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  They always want to set up checkpoints,
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  and they always want to take over your business,
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  and they always want your wife.
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.000]  And every evil person in one of these systems
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  is now being given power.
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  You know, it was confirmed that police,
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  it actually came out in the back of the news,
[48:01.000 --> 48:02.000]  back of the paper,
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  would shoot anyone trying to walk out on the highways.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  They wouldn't let you leave New Orleans.
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  They would come to your house, take your guns,
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  and make you go to the Superdome to be raped
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  with no one protecting you,
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  and then the police would come back
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  to a good-looking woman's house,
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  tie their husband up, and rape them,
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.000]  and then kill them.
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  Oh, yeah, I've talked to people that saw it.
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  And it was little footnotes, yeah,
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  a lot of dead bodies, yeah, tied up families,
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.000]  raped and killed by the police.
[48:31.000 --> 48:32.000]  That's America.
[48:32.000 --> 48:33.000]  Now, is every city that bad?
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  No, but it soon will be,
[48:35.000 --> 48:36.000]  because they're getting rid of all the good cops,
[48:36.000 --> 48:37.000]  just like Sir Pico said,
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  and they're putting people in
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  that want to tie you up
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  and rape your wife
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  and bash your children's brains out in front of you
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  before they take a switchblade out and slit your throat.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  You're like, why would they do that?
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  Because they like to do that.
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  Do you like to take a girl out and date her
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.000]  and get to know her and all that passion and everything?
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  They don't like that.
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.000]  They like women tied up.
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  And they like uniforms,
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  and they like black uniforms,
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  and they like checkpoints.
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  That's every culture that goes under,
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  whether it's communist or fascist,
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  if it's authoritarian,
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  it creates the same thing, okay?
[49:15.000 --> 49:16.000]  And we're here now.
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  And they're openly saying businesses are bad now, okay?
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  And they're openly,
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  I've talked to military,
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  you know, we have the whistleblower email,
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  people can send us whistleblower,
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  whistleblowers at infowars.com.
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  But it's coming in,
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  and we already have video that happening,
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  where they're training the troops nationwide
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  that anyone that resists having their guns taken
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  and being taken to a FEMA camp,
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  and forcibly inoculated,
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  is a, quote, domestic terrorist,
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  and you are to kill them.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  And you don't want to endanger yourself
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  with somebody who's a dead-ender.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  That's what they call it when you're in your house,
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  their family.
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  They're just going to pull up with a armored vehicle,
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  with a flamethrower on the end,
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  just like Waco,
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  and they're going to burn your house down.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  And then say you burned your house down.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  And it won't be on the news.
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  It'll just be some houses burned down tonight.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  So the answer is,
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  so this 1984 is 1776.
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.000]  And the answer is,
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  if this stuff does go to that,
[50:10.000 --> 50:11.000]  and does unfold,
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  and they're going around trying to pick everybody up,
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  you don't wait at your house, folks, okay?
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  That's, that's Rural 101.
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  Because these cowards will come,
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  and they will burn your house down.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  And they'll sit around and joke about it.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  You know, they would pull over Iraqi families,
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  and just run their tanks over,
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  and laugh at them,
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  and say that's what you get for looting.
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  The family is out there getting sticks
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  out of a field.
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  They have a fire to cook their food.
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  And the army pulls up with the neighbors,
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  with little kids,
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  and it's an old broken down car,
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  and they line them up.
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.000]  They shoot the car,
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  laugh at them as the family cries,
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  run over it,
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  and then look,
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  and again,
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  all of it will be visited on us.
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  The 52 million aborted babies,
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  all of the dead in our name.
[50:53.000 --> 50:57.000]  It will all come back sevenfold on America.
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  You understand that?
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  We'll be right back.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  Let me ask you a question.
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  What does freedom mean to you?
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  The freedom to choose,
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  the freedom to vote,
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  and freedom to worship.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  How about the freedom

[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  Preparedness should be simple.
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.000]  And it is.
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  Just remember disasterstuff.com.
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  Freedom through self-reliance
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  and personal responsibility.
[54:00.000 --> 54:05.000]  We don't need no education.
[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  Yeah, we don't need any brainwashing control.
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.000]  The president breaking in
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  over radio, TV, and cell phones,
[54:11.000 --> 54:12.000]  giving us messages.
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  We don't need Janet Napolitano
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  and most Walmart's now on Jumbotrons
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  saying, watch everyone but the government.
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  Trust no one but your loving government.
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.000]  We don't need the president up there
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  saying entrepreneurs are bad
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  and lazy and scum,
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  but welfare people are great,
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  including corporate welfare.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  Again, the TSA sticks their hands
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  down your pants now.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  It's all meant to be over the top.
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.000]  It's all meant to be an over-the-top,
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  complete police state system
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  in your face.
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  And now you've got all these people
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  don't know how to work,
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  can't find good jobs to work
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  because of inflation.
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.000]  The McDonald's jobs
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  aren't able to pay for anything.
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  They're eating poison food,
[54:56.000 --> 54:57.000]  they're getting sick,
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  and the answer is get the rich people.
[54:59.000 --> 55:00.000]  And that means your neighbor
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  they've got $10 more than you.
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  You go to these big welfare cities
[55:04.000 --> 55:05.000]  like Chicago and other areas
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  and you see the poor welfare people
[55:07.000 --> 55:08.000]  and they look at anybody
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  with nice shoes or a nice shirt
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  like they are trash and with hate.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  These people have no hope,
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  no dreams, they watch television
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  about bling and pee-ditty all day
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  and feel like total trash.
[55:20.000 --> 55:23.000]  This mass-marketed Madison Avenue
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  makes them feel like total garbage
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  and takes their destiny away,
[55:27.000 --> 55:30.000]  their self-respect, everything.
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  And then the bureaucracy comes to them
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  and says you don't have to just be on welfare,
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  you can be a bureaucrat,
[55:35.000 --> 55:36.000]  you can be a CPS,
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  you can be a cop,
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  you can be a meter maid,
[55:39.000 --> 55:40.000]  you can be a bureaucrat,
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  you're going to be a green police.
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.000]  And they say, yes, we are.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  And so if you're on your piece
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  of your property out there
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  bird-watching and a bunch of weirdos
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  show up in uniforms to get in your face,
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  folks, that's who they are.
[55:58.000 --> 55:59.000]  CPS comes to take your kids,
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  they're generally 400, 500-pound
[56:01.000 --> 56:02.000]  former welfare recipients
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  who can hardly talk,
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  but they're going to take your crying kid
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.000]  and put them on Prozac
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  when they cry for you at age four.
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  They're going to commit their crimes
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  against us over and over again.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  Coming up after I take a few calls,
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  we've got former Senator John DeKamp
[56:17.000 --> 56:18.000]  who exposed,
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  and I'm sure I'm thinking about this
[56:20.000 --> 56:21.000]  and I remembered it
[56:21.000 --> 56:22.000]  and sure enough,
[56:22.000 --> 56:23.000]  there was an article about it.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  He had exposed stuff at Penn State
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.000]  15, 16, 17 years ago.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  He's coming up.
[56:32.000 --> 56:33.000]  Unbelievable.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  And how high it really goes.
[56:36.000 --> 56:37.000]  I want to play a clip, though,
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.000]  of Romney.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  I mentioned this, imagine.
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  Romney's talking to the NAACP
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.000]  and he says,
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  we're going to get rid of Obamacare.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  They're like, no, boo, boo.
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  They turn Americans away all day long,
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  but if you're an illegal alien,
[56:53.000 --> 56:54.000]  they don't turn you away,
[56:54.000 --> 56:55.000]  but you're not supposed to turn citizens away.
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  No one can be turned away from healthcare
[56:57.000 --> 56:58.000]  or from drugs.
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.000]  It's called charity care.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  Most of these hospitals are charity.
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  They're supposed to have half their business be charity.
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.000]  A regular doctor is supposed to be 30%.
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  But now under Obamacare,
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  they're getting rid of the charity care
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  and it doesn't cover preexisting conditions.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  And it's written by the insurance companies,
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  but they don't care.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  Because, you know, Obama,
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  he sits up there with a fake,
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.000]  you know, urban black accent
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  and reads off a teleprompter.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  And you know what, people feel like they're winning.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  Just like Republicans feel like
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  they're going to win with Mitt Romney.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  Because he's a Republican.
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  Here it is.
[57:38.000 --> 57:39.000]  And so to do that,
[57:39.000 --> 57:40.000]  I'm going to eliminate every
[57:40.000 --> 57:43.000]  non-essential expensive program I can find.
[57:43.000 --> 57:44.000]  That includes Obamacare.
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  And I'm going to work to reform and save.
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  All right, that's enough.
[57:59.000 --> 58:02.000]  And you notice he was pleased by the boo.
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  Because even though he plans to continue
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.000]  everything Obama's doing,
[58:05.000 --> 58:07.000]  because that's the globalist game plan,
[58:07.000 --> 58:08.000]  the rhetoric, though,
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  at least he now can get some popularity
[58:10.000 --> 58:11.000]  amongst conservatives.
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  And his popularity is going up now.
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  Well, he did write Obamacare.
[58:15.000 --> 58:16.000]  He is for open borders,
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  carbon taxes, and salt weapon bands.
[58:18.000 --> 58:22.000]  But he's talking the right talk now.
[58:22.000 --> 58:23.000]  But no, he won't tell you about,
[58:23.000 --> 58:24.000]  if he would have said,
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  listen, these mega-manx and big
[58:26.000 --> 58:27.000]  foreign corporations,
[58:27.000 --> 58:28.000]  they've gotten trillions.
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  We're going to cut that.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  And we're going to give that back to you
[58:32.000 --> 58:33.000]  in tax breaks.
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  He might have gotten a cheer,
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  but instead he just put it out
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  kind of as that mainline Republican
[58:38.000 --> 58:43.000]  to get the bloat.
[58:43.000 --> 58:44.000]  This is GCN,

[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  Big brother,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  mainstream media,
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  Okay, I haven't even gotten into
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  a lot of the news yet,
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  and we willed,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  including our Pios investigation,
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  finding that the birth certificate
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  has been tampered.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  That's like saying,
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  we've discovered that bears
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  go to the bathroom in the woods.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  Everybody's like,
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  oh, that's a ridiculous conspiracy theory.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  Yes, and that birds fly.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  We have discovered that water is wet.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  they first said that the...
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  I'm going to get into it later.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  It's just...
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  Remember for three years,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  they said that other birth certificate
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  was the only one.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  There was no long form.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  Then we get the long form
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  and it was a computer font
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  that's supposed to look like typewriter.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  The C's, the T's, the A's,
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  they're all identical.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  That doesn't happen with a typewriter, folks.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  Each one is a...
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  I looked at it in two hours,
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  went online,
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  we put a video out,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  they got a million views,
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  showing it's fake.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  Of course it's fake.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  Do I need 20 forensics people
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  to tell me that?
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  What do you think forensics people
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  look at, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  They call him an African in there.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  They didn't start calling him that
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  until the 1980s on record.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  And that's what our Pios shows,
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  is the sheet they used.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  No one ever used the word
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  that they were an African-American.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  Man, I tell you, folks.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  I tell you.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  But again, it was lies within lies.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  We're like, hey,
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  you say you were born in Kenya
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  for 16 and a half years
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  in your own literature,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  your own publicist,
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  your wife says in speeches
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  you're born in Kenya.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  That was the old cover story.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  He was really born in Hawaii
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  to Frank Marshall Davis.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  And we're like, hey,
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  you say you were born there.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  Now, your dad doesn't look like you
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  over there, but whatever.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  And now we know
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  he's Frank Marshall Davis' son.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  And now he gives speeches
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  like Frank Marshall Davis'.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  You dirty small businesses.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  You filth.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  You bitter clingers.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  We're going to get you.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  You sure cling to
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  your hundreds of secret service
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  that guards you.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  They had thousands of different
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  police and secret service out.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  Your house was getting robbed
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  yesterday in Austin.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  Sorry.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  Everybody had to
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  sycophantically run around
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  behind Obama.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  What a nobody.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  But it's meant for all the sheep
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  to think he's a somebody.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  Bush, Obama,
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  they're all just thumb-sucking
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  puppets of the bankers.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  Makes me want to throw up.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  Talking to evil entrepreneurs.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  James Brent, Steve, Aaron Doris.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  James in California.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  James, are you an evil entrepreneur?
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  I mean, do you want to
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  apologize to America
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  for hiring people?
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  Absolutely not.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  That's what we're founded on.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  I'm so frustrated at this.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  It hurts me every day.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  Again, the anger and frustration.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  You're a bad, no, no.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  You're bad.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Your employment is good.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  Admit you're wrong.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Admit North Korea is great.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  Back in 2008, I was making
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  $60,000 a year, and the company
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  I was working for went under,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  and I didn't file for
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  unemployment, and I haven't
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  filed for it since then.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  I started my own business.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  You're a bad person.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  I've not taken the money.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  I specifically don't.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  I could have taken, you know,
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  $60,000, what, $40,000 a year
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  for a year and a half,
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  and I didn't take that.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  Instead, I've had to pay
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  more taxes and get no benefit.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  I get no credit for not taking
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  the $40,000, and instead,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  what I get is I have to pay
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  more taxes for the $15,000
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  that I make because I'm now
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  an entrepreneur in a small business.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  It's so immoral, so unjust.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  Thank you for your life and your
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  fortune and your sacred honor.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  No, I'm going to admit I'm bad
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  for now having over 40 people
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  that work here.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  We're about to go up to 50,
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  spending every backup dime
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  we've got to go to the next level.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  I want to apologize for hiring
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  people right out of college
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  and hiring people that have been
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  let go from TV stations because
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  of cutbacks and radio stations.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  I want to apologize for hiring
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  graphics people.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  I want to apologize for not
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  being on welfare and not living
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  in a slum and watching daytime
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  TV all day and going out and
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  mugging people on my off time.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  I want to apologize right now.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  A righteous man.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  In 2000, I had carpal tunnel
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  and could be on permanent
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  disability since then.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  So, absolutely.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  Anyone, if you can get off of
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  disability, if you can just
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  How dare you?
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  How dare you?
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  How dare you?
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  How dare you?
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  You're going to be happier
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  watching daytime TV all day
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  if your handicap or whatever.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  Don't go out and get a job and
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  get past your handicap.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  Let the country go bankrupt
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  for Soviet reeducation.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  We're almost there.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  We're almost to total state.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  We're going to be like North
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  Korea soon.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  All of you in uniform will be
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  more powerful.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  It's going to be great.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  Just like North Korea.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  It's almost here.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  What does freedom mean to you?
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  The freedom to choose,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  the freedom to vote,
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  the freedom to worship.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  How about the freedom to take
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  control of your own future?
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  My friends at eFoods Direct
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  are celebrating freedom this

[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  dependency food.

[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  of food free.

[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  off your grocery bill.

[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  right now.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  This is Alex Jones with
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000]  five good reasons you should
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  consider buying a solar power
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000]  generator.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  Number one, new climate
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  legislation could easily double
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]  Number two, our new energy
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  czar wants to control how much
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  power your electric company
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  allows you to have.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  It's true.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000]  Total government control of
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  electricity in the name of
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  smart grid technology is
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  coming.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  Number three, in some areas
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  of the country, the
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  most important thing is
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  electricity.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  In some areas of the
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  country, the most important
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  thing is electricity.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  In some areas of the country,
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  the power grid is dangerously
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  overloaded.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  And now, new socialist
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  legislation is only
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  compounding the problem.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  Number four, dangerous
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  weather is always a threat
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  to local grids.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  Every year, thousands of
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  families lose their power
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  from weather-related
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  onages.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  Number five, a solar power
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  generator provides powerful
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  backup insurance and peace of
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  mind.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  Folks, I really believe in
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  the solar power generators
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  offered by Solutions from
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  Science, one of my oldest
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  sponsors.

[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  That's www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  Remember, the government
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  doesn't own the sun, so go
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  to www.mysolarbackup.com
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  Hi, folks.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  This is Alex Jones, and I
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  want to tell you about the
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  Now, you can produce pure
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  and endless colloidal silver
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  and deliver the solution
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  directly into the bloodstream
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  by breathing the solution
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  through the lungs.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  The respiratory system is
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  the first line of defense
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  for airborne pathogens and
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  viruses.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  The system is the first line
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  of defense for airborne
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  pathogens and viruses.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  infuses the respiratory system
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  with your self-produced
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  nano-silver solutions
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  and also delivers the silver
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  nanoparticles instantly
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  into the bloodstream
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  with continued legislation
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  threatening the sale
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  of nano-silver products.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  You can now produce pure
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  and endless colloidal silver
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  Very easy to follow
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  step-by-step instructions
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  are provided, making production
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  fast and simple.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  Go to www.mysolarbackup.com
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  www.silverlungs.com today
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  and learn more about
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  the breakthrough technology
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  Senator John DeKamp
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  has had an emergency today.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  He's unable to do the full hour.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  He's on the road right now.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  Stopped.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  Only be able to listen
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  about 20 minutes.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  And then I'm going to get
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  him back for a full hour
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  next Tuesday
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  before he goes in for surgery.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  This could not be
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  a more important interview
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  you're about to hear.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  He is the best-selling author
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  of the Franklin Cover-Up.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  He's also proven this in court
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  one time at News Media
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  said he was a liar.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  He sued him and won.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  Child abuse,
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  Satanism, and the murder
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  in Nebraska.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  During 16 years in office,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  a former state senator,
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  John DeKamp,
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  was cited even by his enemies
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  at the World Herald
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  as one of the most effective
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  legislators in Nebraska history.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  A highly decorated
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  Vietnam War veteran in 1975,
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  he initiated Operation Baby
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  Live, which evacuated
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  2,800 orphan Vietnamese children.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  He is currently a practicing
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  attorney in Lincoln, Nebraska.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  He served as a lawyer
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  for the Militia Montana
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  Constitutional Militia Group
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  in the 90s.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  DeKamp has also been
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  lead perspective on
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  conspiracy of silence,
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  an unerred documentary
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  on the Franklin Child
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  abuse.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  Well, we aired it.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  We got it and aired it
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  locally on Access 15 years ago,
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  and it since went viral online.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  That's where that people
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  always say,
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  have you seen this?
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  I'm the one that put it out.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  He joins us now.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  And here's the red dirt report.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  And when I saw this this weekend,
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  it punched me.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  I was like,
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  I remember him saying that,
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  but since it hadn't been
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  in court in the news,
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  I'm like, let's not go there,
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  Senator.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  But I remember him getting into
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  Boys Town before that all came
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  out, the Catholic Church.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  I remember him getting into
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  Penn State.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  And I remember him saying on air
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  more than 10 years ago,
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  that the football program,
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  and I'm like,
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  I know he's credible,
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  but I'm like, okay,
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  Senator, let's just stop.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  Folks, by the way,
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  have dug those interviews up now.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  I'm like, let's just stop right
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  there and just get into what
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  was proven in court.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  Because people went to jail
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  in Nebraska.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  He was hired as a big Republican
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  because, you know,
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  to go in and disprove it.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  They're like, oh, this couldn't
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  be true, Senator.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  You go to disprove it.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  When his investigator,
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  a police officer,
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  and his son got murdered,
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  the senator started to look
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  closer.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  So he's going to recap all that.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  So he was hired as a prominent
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  Republican and a senator to go
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  in there as damage control,
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  because, you know,
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  he didn't believe it was real,
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  and found out it was all real
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  and more.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  And this goes directly to the
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  pedophile networks who were
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  Satanist.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  And of course,
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  you've seen it come out in the
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  local Penn State news,
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  that it's a state secret,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  Sandusky, that he was pimping
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  the kids out.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  Of course, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  he joins us now.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  Senator John DeKamp to recap
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  the history.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  Bohemian Grove's going on right
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  now.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  His connections led into there
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  as well.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  A dead body's dumped outside the
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  Bohemian Grove.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  Senator DeKamp,
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  thank you for joining us, sir.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  Thank you for letting me come
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  on.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  It's been a long time since
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  we've talked.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  And so many strange,
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  strange things have happened
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  in that distance of time.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  You mentioned
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  Pennsylvania State.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  I had in my own mind completely
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  forgotten about that.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  But then I started checking,
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  because I started getting calls
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  about six months ago,
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  from just gobs of people over
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  in Pennsylvania.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  And they said,
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  well, you told us about this
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  10 or 15 years ago, blah, blah,
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  And I said, well, maybe.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  They said, yeah, it was even in
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  your book.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  You said something about it.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  And I said, well, I got to be
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  honest with you.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  I don't remember.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  And then I started doing some
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  checking.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  And I guess I was even on your
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  program way back when and brought
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  up Penn State and everything.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  But because I had been sued in
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  three different states on the
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  Franklin thing, and by the way,
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  the last one of those just ended
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  about a year and a half ago in
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  Albany, Utah, the former police
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  chief, or the key principles I
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  named, he had sued me
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  because he had lost his police
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  job at the end of the police
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  force there after he got thrown
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  out of Nebraska when I exposed
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  him.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  And so he sued me.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  And we had a full scale trial,
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  this last trial in Albany, Utah,
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  Mormon Central.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  And it was amazing.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  I brought in people from way
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  back then and ended up winning.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  And then he took it to the
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  Supreme Court.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  The Supreme Court dismissed it
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  and said, I was right.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  Well, so you've won.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  Just to be clear, three different
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  lawsuits ban.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  Three different states going up
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  to their Supreme Court on the
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  issue of Franklin and things I
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  said.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  Well, let me ask you this.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  I won a million dollar judgment
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  even though I haven't been able to
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  collect it.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  It's one of the key principles
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  named Larry King, not the Larry
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  King that's famous on the radio
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  and TV.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  Yeah.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  Yeah.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  Not Larry King of seeing a hand.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  Yeah.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  Yeah.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  Anyway.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  And won a million dollar
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  judgment and a full scale trial
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  had witnesses, for example,
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  Johnny Gosh's mother.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  First time she'd ever been in
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  court and testified that I had
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  located for her, which I did.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  Her son, Johnny, who had been
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  kidnapped, you know, was that
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  ring of people that kidnapped
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  kids and used them for sex and
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  so on and so forth.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  And just one thing after another,
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  and then these latest calls from
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  Pennsylvania people saying I had
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  brought her up way back then.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  I guess it rocked and shocked me.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  I'm 71 years old now, turned 71
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  here in the last month.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  And about 16 months ago I noticed
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  that so many things I used to
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  remember, I couldn't remember
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  anymore.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  So I'm taking special medicine for
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  that, but supposedly it helps
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  you.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  But I started looking things up
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  and talking to some of the people
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  and then I got a call from you and
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  you said that I'd brought it up on
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  the program years and years ago
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  and went into depth.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  And I did kind of halfway
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  remember and then one of the things
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  I did was I even used the names
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  back then, some of them
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  including
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  the football team
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  and I mean certain people there
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  that are now involved.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  Now I understand, I mean you were
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  told all this close to 20 years ago
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  you covered in the last 15, I mean
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  the whole issue is from your deep
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  research and people contacting you
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  and convictions and things that
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  happened, we had the Texas Youth
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  Commission that nobody knows about
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  outside Texas where at almost all
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  their major facilities with the
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  youth, they were raping them,
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  selling them for sex, gladiatorial
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  fights and the Texas Rangers
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  they tried to stop it, they were
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  told stand down.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  I mean my point is that
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  so you know about it, I mean how big
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  is this empire of satanic pedophiles
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  from your research?
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  It is one son of a bitching big empire
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  and just
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  amazes me
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  how accurate I was way back then
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  and
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  things that have come out and
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  thanks
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  I'm real
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  and so I'm going back and read my own
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  book again, you know it was a New
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  York Times best dollar and two other
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  books were written which basically
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  copied it after that
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  but Franklin cover up was the name of
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  the book and just
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  had the first things out there and
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  they basically went by mine.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  Now Senator let me stop
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  you right there, specifically though
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  looking at the Penn State
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  situation you got Sandusky
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  now convicted of raping
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  children at high noon in the middle of
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  the afternoon in the public showers
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  the fact that now
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  even the former FBI director's
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  research says
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  the entire top staff knew
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  covered it up that makes them accomplices
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  local print and local
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  radio the guy that finally pushed this
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  out to break it you know last year
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  they have said that the word
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  is we played these clips here from the news
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  the word is
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  that there was
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  all
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  sorts of this going on
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  and they were doing this and pimping
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  the children out well that's what
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  Sandusky was not the only
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  one he's the only one today
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  being
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  convicted or whatever charged
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  but that was just like
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  happened in Nebraska they covered up
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  I had to cover up for the police chief
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  but I finally
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  exposed him
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  completely and he tried to sue me then
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  in different states he went to and got ahead
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  of their police force for the state
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  so on and each time
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  well I don't know
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  the specifics of that but I mean
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  tell us about the convictions that have happened
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  tell us about Larry King
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  and then whatever you can remember
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  because I know you also have a
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  I have a judgment against Larry King
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  for a million dollars the same trial
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  that I was
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  the first one in the whole United States
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  to sue the Catholic
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  church and some priests
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  was a judge it was a
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  case I won the million dollar judgment
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  but they dismissed the Catholic
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  church
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  because
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  they said this is just absurd
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  to accuse these priests
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  that's right you were one of the first
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  in the I mean how many
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  I was the first first case in the United
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  States and I ended up winning a million
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  dollar judgment after
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  trial and then trial
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  just separately on the damages
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  and I wonder
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  one a million
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  actually a million two hundred thousand
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  for the kid who was just
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  one of the... but sir specifically Larry King
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  the guy that sung
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  the Star Spangled Banner at the Republican National Convention
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  Republican Pimp
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  he went to jail too
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  oh yeah yeah but
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  then he got out after a couple years
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  because uh
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  you still had the cover up going big time
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  in Nebraska that's when I wrote the book
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  I just said you know
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  same old thing but people
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  in very high up places from
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  judges to
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  who uh
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  police chiefs
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  others who
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  are participating
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  in the use of these children
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  I mean I couldn't
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  believe the first things I did
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  when I started investigating it
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  just after I got out of being a senator
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  I
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  represented a little girl
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  and uh
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  I couldn't believe it because
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  I had written publicly in all the
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  newspapers in Nebraska
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  uh I'm the first one to say
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  I can't believe any of these things
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  or so preposterous these kids stories
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  I said but
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  I will check into it and I've agreed to represent
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  this one girl who's
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  trying to prosecute because she was just a little girl then
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  and she was telling her
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  stories and so they were
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  substituting her
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  wanting to put her in an institution
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  instead of the people which she had accused
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  and uh
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  oh god it's
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  strange, strange, strange
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  Senator Camp can we be specific here
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  tell us tell us
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  how you were first the Republicans
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  first came to you and said well you're saying this isn't
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  true we want you to investigate
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  because it was going to the top of the Republican party
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  I mean and then what happened
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  I said I am
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  just being just I don't believe it
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  and I had gotten out of being Senate
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  even though it happened while I was there
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  and uh
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  okay tell people what happened to your
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  investigator
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000]  oh he got killed he got
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  murdered he and his son
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  in an airplane and
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  just on and on and on it
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  it's an insane insane story
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  my book is on amazon.com now you know
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  even though I sold it
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  myself by
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000]  that tens and hundreds of thousands
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  of books but then it went on
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  amazon.com here about
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000]  I don't know two years ago maybe
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  and it's on amazon.com
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000]  now called the Franklin coverup
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  and it's kind of funny because
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  you know there was
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  so many people in key high places
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  covering this up right up into
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  the Congress I named people there
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  I understand and you've always
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  wanted the suits but just to be
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  just to be general here
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  from your research all over the country
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  you called Boys Town before it was in the news
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  you called the Catholic priest thing
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  saying there was a network in there 20 years ago
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000]  Pennsylvania
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  yeah yeah Pennsylvania I mean you went
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  to Pennsylvania you investigated I understand
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  you've gotten older and don't remember all this
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  I mentioned that on your program
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  I think about 10 years ago
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  yes and I asked you not to talk about it because there never
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  I mean I didn't want to get sued
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  but now it's you've been proven right again yes
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  okay listen
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  I got a run now
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  and we'll do that
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  hour long program next
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  Tuesday and I'll have a good phone
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  or a good location then so I'm ready
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  I understand you had an emergency but just briefly
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  from your nationwide research
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  how what's the percentage
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  we had to dead reckon I mean how big
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  is this network this cult
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  it's pretty good size that it involves
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  usually very
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  high up people who
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  as I said in my book the system
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  protects itself for example
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  with
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  police chief kind of pulls somebody off
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  with something and a judge
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  kind of gets influenced
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  or pressured to
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  throw out the case
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  and so on and so forth it just is
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  beyond anything I never believe any of it
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  I with public consent
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  this all has to be make believe
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  I'm the first one
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  to tell you it can't be true
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  but I am going to look into it
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  just so I can prove it
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  and you said that in document it
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  Satanism sits on top of it so
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  I mean if say 20%
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  most frequently that is involved
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  this is Tanny Cole stuff now
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000]  I can't believe it but
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  it's true
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  all right well listen I know you're going in for surgery
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  next week so the promise I can get you on
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000]  it's Wednesday morning so
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  you gotta do it Tuesday or otherwise
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  week till after I get back to the surgery
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  one final comment
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  we lost a guy who helped you
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  fight a lot of tyranny
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  former FBI Southern California
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  LA director Ted Gunnerson
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  I know that you'd worked with
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  honey you should mention that
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  he was one of them
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  that didn't believe anything either
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  and then when he got embossed
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  guess what he was second
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  in command of the FBI
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  and he moved here to Nebraska
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  and lived with me and worked with me
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  and right here
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  uh
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  a while ago
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  not very long ago now
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  what is it a year, year and a half
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  he was a great guy
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  yep he was one great guy
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  as I say he
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  he gave up everything after he
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  went to the
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  retirement from the FBI
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  and moved to Nebraska and lived in one of my houses
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  I'll tell you lots more
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  when we talk next week
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  alright so thank you so much
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  sorry you had that emergency
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  we'll talk for a full hour next Monday or Tuesday
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  hopefully on Skype, thank you
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  thank you
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  yeah folks
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  most of the old interviews are being pulled
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  we don't have a big crew, a big staff
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  but if everybody can go find
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  the Alex Jones interviews
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  Senator John DeKamp interviews
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  there's probably six or seven of them out there
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  I remember the interviews
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  and when I saw the Red Dirt
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  report
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  with quotes of him years ago talking about stuff
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  I went and looked
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  and tried to find some of them and I can't remember which interviews it was
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  but I remember him going
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  the Catholic Church
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  Boys Town, Penn State
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  Pennsylvania, how he traveled to Pennsylvania
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  and obviously I knew that
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  you know he was in lawsuits with people that had been
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  convicted of this stuff
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  and they were still suing and of course he's won
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  three of those, he's won them all
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  so I was like whoa, whoa, let's not get into
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  because even though I knew
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  he was a credible guy, imagine
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  you're hearing Penn State football program
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  so we've got to dig
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  that audio up of that radio show
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  it was multiple interviews
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  with Senator John DeKamp
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  15 years ago
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  12 years ago
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  10, I haven't interviewed DeKamp
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  probably in six years or so
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  because it's very dangerous to interview him
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  it's one of the things
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  you start getting death threats over
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  it's nothing even
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  scared of those, it's just something
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  that
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  people aren't ready to believe
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  but maybe now they are
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  I mean the dead bodies dumped outside
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  Bohemian Grove
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  the little kids getting grabbed
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  these are monsters ladies and gentlemen
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  these are monsters
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  DeKamp said he was going to go public
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  and disprove it
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  well-known retired police detective
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  who was a well-known private investigator
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  they blew his plane up
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  they killed a bunch of other people
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  they were killing them left and right
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  the FBI came in and took all the police
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  investigation photos of what
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  was being run by these people
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  and you find out about this stuff
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  there's a reason you don't want a big government
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  and there's a reason you don't want it
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  to have this national security stuff
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  I mean look at the UN
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  type in UN sex trade
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  UN child sex trade
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  I mean it's literally thousands of BBC
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  Reuters, New York Times
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  but it's like back of the paper
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  I mean there are photos all over the web
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  of the UN torturing small children to death
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  roasting them over fires
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000]  you think I'm joking just type UN torturing children
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  and you're like why though
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  it's because they like it
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  this is what they do and they have diplomatic community
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  and God help us
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  because you know right here
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  I mean so much
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  when I get to camp on for a full hour
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  next week
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  I will
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  I will get into all that
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  but he knew about the Texas Youth Commission
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  I mean I remember like five years ago
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  when the Texas Youth Commission stuff came out
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  I was like judges and police
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  and the locals
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  go to the big juvenile justice centers
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  and go pick the kid out they wanted
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  and they were having gladiatory battles
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  and this was admitted
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  and then no one got in trouble
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  I mean
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  can you imagine pulling up to a juvenile justice thing
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  with a bunch of kids you've grabbed
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  most cases for no reason
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  and then these weirdos
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  go creeping around
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  and go into the different
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  jail cells and then no one gets in trouble
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  it's a child brothel
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  and that came out in the
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  state police reports
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  that came out with the witnesses
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  and all of it and then just got shut down
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  just got completely shut down
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  and the state police
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  and the old culture they had here in Texas
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  were more friendly and professional
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  now you go down to the Capitol
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  it's so rude, so hateful
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  it's like being in DC or something
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  they want you to know you're scum
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  and I've talked to some of the old timers
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  I said man things have changed they said yeah
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  and I can't even talk to you, you bet they've changed
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  this country's been taken over by evil
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  I mean folks I hate to get back
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  on this subject over and over again
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  but 50 plus million, 51, 52 million babies
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  have been killed in this country
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  over a million of them
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  just the last decade who were
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  seven, eight, nine months
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  I mean they could deliver the baby
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  no one tells the woman hey there's a huge line
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  for kids of any color
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  race
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  for people that want to adopt them
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  no one even tells them oh there are charities
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  that will pay you hundreds of thousands of dollars
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  to have the child and then adopt it out to a good family
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  that's why people that are adopting
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  import children
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  no one tells them that there's actually more people
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  that want to adopt than that are having abortions
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  because they got that quota to kill kids
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  I mean we kill kids
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  and say they're not humans
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  a government that's into this
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  a system that's into this these are sick people
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  and the average
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  grass-roots person says oh it's not a human
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  it's just my choice they're not consciously evil
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  but they're involved in something
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  massively corrupt
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  and if you've been involved in that as long as you
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  are sorry for it
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  and try to wake up others
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  I understand you've got guilt out there
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  so you're going to stick with your bad decision
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  and defend it
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  because you don't want to admit you're wrong
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  but the freedom lies
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  in repenting
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  and if you don't believe in God, repent to the universe
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  repent to that child
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  you chopped up
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  once you go to the local butcher
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  and watch them chopping up a cow
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  chopping up a chicken
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  when they get there those babies struggle
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  and try to get away and they just come in
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  hack, hack, hack
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  and if you hear that
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  they want to outlaw showing dead babies
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  of course
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  now they want to kill kids up to age 3
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  of course they want to euthanize old people
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  why does every culture get psychos in control
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  look at every other civilization
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  these evil people get in control
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  and Katie barred the door
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:58.000]  we're on the march, the empire's on the run
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  these filters are silver and pregnant
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  to prevent bacterial growth
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  there's no priming required
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  it's NSF42 certified
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  up to 95%
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  easy to set up and use
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  doesn't require electricity
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000]  this filter system leaves in beneficial minerals
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  which is key
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  save money by not buying bottled water
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  ProPure is the best gravity fed filter out there
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  it only uses Infowars.com
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  already has the lowest price on ProPure
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  but if you add the promo code water at checkout
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000]  you get an additional 10% off
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000]  at Infowars.com

[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  and here's the best part
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000]  these seeds have not been genetically modified
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000]  in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  to plant a full acre crisis garden

[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000]  remember, in a real crisis
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000]  this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000]  let me ask you a question
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000]  what does freedom mean to you?
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000]  the freedom to choose, the freedom to vote
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  the freedom to worship
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000]  how about the freedom to take control of your own future

[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000]  alright, I'm gonna get into
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000]  a bunch of news we haven't covered yet
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  after I've talked to five or six more entrepreneurs
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000]  we open the phones up for entrepreneurs
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  to respond to Obama saying
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  you're nothing
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  you didn't do a business
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  you're not successful because you worked hard
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  you don't even deserve any of the credit basically
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  and you're like man
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  that's really attacking the American dream
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  the American system
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  I mean look at the welfare system
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  look at what it creates
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  look at the cities run by the globalist
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  their hellholes
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  it seems over the top
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  but that's what North Korea teaches
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  it's what Communist China teaches
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  it's what Fidel Castro teaches
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  it's what Hugo Chavez teaches
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  it's what the universities teach
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  and it's what the big mega-monopoly
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  banks and corporations teach
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  it's what they want, it's what they want to push
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  now I want to show you an article here
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  that I just got during the break
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  but I'm very familiar with these type of hit pieces
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  and I'm gonna get an article written about this
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  at eFood Wars.com
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  or PrismPlanet.com
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  by Paul Watson probably is who I'll call
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  to do a blurb on this from the next hour or so
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  we'll get a report out on this
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  or the next two hours or so
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  but we'll also link to it right now
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  at infowars.com
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  it's out of think, progress
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  one of the fake
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  liberal channels
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  and we'll show people a document camshot of that
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  that
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  poses as a gatekeeper
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  now this is like media matters
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  funded by George Soros
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  weekly meetings with the White House
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  saying they would infiltrate alternative media
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  and destroy them from the inside
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  criminal activity
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  I mean like a foreign government
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  racketeering that they would get in and destroy
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  now remember they write articles about us
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  at all these big so-called liberal sites
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  saying world government doesn't exist
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  Obama being corrupt doesn't exist
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  none of this is real
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  vaccines are good for you
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  and we're on the lock
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  he didn't hang out at the Pentagon
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  even though that's Fox News
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  Associated Press basically I'm crazy
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  but they constantly write articles
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  that I hardly ever cover
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  harping
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  media matters you name it
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  and I'll show folks a shot of this right now
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  if you're watching at prisonplanet.tv
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  if not just type in report
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  Drudge funneled at least 30 million visitors
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  to conspiracy websites in the last year
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  and I look at where they claim
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  they got that data
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  and I don't
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  if they count world net daily and info wars
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  as the two sites that's not really true
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  so
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  they don't really even explain how they get this data
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  but it says
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  the Drudge report links to conspiracy websites
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  and
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  it goes on to say
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  that Drudge drives more traffic than any other
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  outfit out there and that's been reported on
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  more than Facebook, Twitter combined
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  and so because he drives so much to mainstream media
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  that people are scared
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  to expose his unsavory activities
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  they actually say that in here
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  they say because he's so big
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  the impact of Drudge
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  support is reflected by public data
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  from Quantcast
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  I don't even get how that explains it
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  typically and then it goes on to
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  break down the entire thing
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  it says according to media sources
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  regularly linked to by Drudge
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  a single link on Drudge report
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  can easily drive 200,000
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  and sometimes as many as 500,000
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  page views in an article
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  but that's not the real power of Drudge
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  all the media watches it
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  and all of talk radio and so
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  they're too lazy to go out and look other places
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  and Drudge really has a hand
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  on the zeitgeist of what is interesting
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  and I mean I go there
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  before he started linking to me 5 years ago
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  every day
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  I go to a bunch of sites but I go there
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  and if something's breaking he's got it up there
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  he and his small team
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  and so the lazy
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  uncreative dinosaur media
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  they go to the Drudge report so the real power
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  isn't just the traffic he sends you
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  it's the lensing effect
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  I'd say 3-4 times the traffic
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  of course these idiots don't understand that
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  that's why they don't have a lot of traffic
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  they're legends in their own mind
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  they get more attention here than they've ever had
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  then it gets all the media to start reporting
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  on what you're doing
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  years ago Drudge started linking to our articles
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  about them groping women
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  and children and going in the pants
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  the TSA came out
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  and said that's a conspiracy theory
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  info wars is evil
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  on their blog it doesn't exist
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  more videos came out
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  showing it they got caught lying
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  but you see the old dinosaur
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  media the George Soros media
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  cannot stand
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  the fact that they can't dominate
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  debate I mean Drudge links to everything
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  to the Russian news
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  to the Japanese news
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  to the British news
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  to the Mexican news to the US news
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  it's just news
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  a great
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  aggregate of what's going on
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  I mean you think the mainstream media
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  could recreate that but they can't help it
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  they want to control everything
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  they want to show a limited spectrum
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  people discovered that
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  Drudge links to us and others
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  because he understands it's interesting
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  it's a lot of breaking news
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  we try to be accurate compared to dinosaur media
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  and we're in the zeitgeist as well
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  so what you see on Drudge is the zeitgeist
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  one of the best representations
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  of it if not the best
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  out there
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  and it's one thing to be able to be in the zeitgeist now
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  what about for 16, 17, 18
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  years
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  and I'm not just going into a Drudge worship
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  fest here the point is Drudge is a trailblazer
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  first linking to us probably
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  eight, nine years ago
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  but our servers couldn't handle it
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  like a parent testing the perch
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  we couldn't handle the traffic and didn't link to us
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  tried again later the last five years
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  Drudge has linked to us hundreds of times
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  and it has really helped us
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  to fight the globalist
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  exposing documents law enforcement
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  sentences saying veterans are terrorists
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  confirmed documents
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  Drudge waited three or four days
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  until the government admitted those were real
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  he linked to us
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  out what to do it was I a conspiracy theorist
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  because I broke secret documents
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  no I was doing what real journalists do
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  I'm a talk show host
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  I give commentary I give analysis
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  I give my opinion but I also give you
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  breaking original news
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  in video audio text
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  guest you name it
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  I gave you 15 years ago
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  that there was pedophile stuff going on
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  at Penn State
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  and a trailblaze
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  so much with my guest I'd forgotten that
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  I was a conspiracy theorist 15 years ago
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  to camp
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  20 years ago seeing the Catholic Church
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  had networks of pedophiles taking it over
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  he was called a conspiracy theorist
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  now it's mainstream news
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  the difference is we're
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  trailblazers we're telling you the earth is round
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  we're telling you that the earth isn't the center of the universe
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  you get locked up
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  for that folks when you're first to say it
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  so what's happening here is they're
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  absolutely in their death rows
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  floundering around
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  and I mean imagine White House
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  funded run controlled media matters
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  sits there as a non-partisan
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  tax free
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  entity
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  operating
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  as if they sit there and tell you
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  what is and what isn't and then they panic
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  that something
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  like DrudgeReport.com
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  is legitimizing to a great extent
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  what we do but you know
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  we've legitimized what we do
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  and Drudge doesn't like tyranny
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  as well and is
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  more and more covering what we do
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  but let me give you a newsflash
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  we've been on XM for over
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  now three years
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  we're on over 115
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  AM and FM affiliates
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  I've been on the cover of
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  Talkers Magazine and all the other big publications
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  I've been in Rolling Stone
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  Nightline, MSNBC
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  you can't ignore us
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  it's the implication that
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  your gatekeeper is over here
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  and then you're going to tell
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  Drudge what he's going to do
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  as if even if you guys
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  were able to manipulate something
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  down the road as if you've stopped us
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  as if anything you've done has stopped us
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  I'm hiring six reporters
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  right now I just hired
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  six graphics people
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  I'm hiring more IT people I'm taking the money
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  that comes in here and putting it right back out
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  because my passion is news
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  and information and truth and defending this Republic
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  I'm one of those bitter clingers
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  Obama talks about I'm one of those
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  free market entrepreneurs
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  for liberty I'm one of those people that works
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  18 hours a day I'm one of those people
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  that has electricity in my mind
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  and a sparkle in my eye okay
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  and you don't like it so you sit there
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  and take your foundation funding
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  your globalist banker takeover
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  collaborator media and you sit there
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  and gatekeep all you want you're not
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  stopping jack crap you got that excuse me
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  excuse me it's a family show
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  okay
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  it's how pathetic and servile
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  and traitorous you are
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  hey have you read
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  the Financial Times of London or Newsweek
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  telling us world governments here run by bankers
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  everybody's heard me for 17 years
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  say global government the form
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  of bankers through derivatives and
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  carbon taxes was coming how'd I know
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  they wrote white papers on it
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  everybody heard me talk about agenda 21
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  17 years ago everybody heard
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  me talk about all this
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  okay so don't sit there up on your perch
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  and tell everybody that you're the
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  gatekeeper and you control reality
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  like Carl Rove said how
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  guys will you print me the Carl Rove quote
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  about history's actors please
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  in front of the New York Times and Washington Post
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  he goes it doesn't matter what reality is
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  you do what we say the public does what we say
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  we can tell you the earth's flat tomorrow
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  and you'll believe it well not
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  me do you understand
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  George Soros
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  do you understand
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  it's unbelievable
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  conservatively drudge drove over 30 million
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  page views to world net daily and info wars
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  in the last year since these sites
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  derived their income from displaying
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  advertisers selling products to web visitors
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  drudge is certainly an important if not
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  essential source of income
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  for conspiracy theorists you idiots
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  if you ever attack me
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  as a frontal assault I could raise $5
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  million in one day
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  we're not funded by George Soros
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  you twet you
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  see you're trying to make Matt drudge
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  George Soros in your little mind
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  you some big robber baron
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  sugar daddy he's not a big robber baron
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  sugar daddy drudge
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  drudge some weeks has driven
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  30% of the traffic on info wars
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  dot com usually it's about 10%
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  but we don't just have info wars
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  we have twitter
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  we have more than 10 facebook pages
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  with more than 800,000 likes
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  we have
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  hundreds of millions of views every few
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  months on youtube on their platforms
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  we've got as you see them
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  tentacles
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  you see liberty as a cancer let me give you
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  a little news flash we've metastasized
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  everywhere that's why the globalists
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  haven't killed me they figured that out
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  at the higher management level than you
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  twits okay there's
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  no shutting the signal down
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  scum we're not funded
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  by one sugar daddy
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  you understand that we're funded by
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  the listeners of this show
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  you know i didn't plug products last
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  hour most radio shows every segment plug a
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  sponsor we could take unlimited
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  sponsors right now and have a little
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  30 second plug during each segment
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  that would bring in 5 million
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  dollars a year do you hear me doing it
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  you ought to be thank your little
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  globalist crony new
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  world order stars that i haven't even tried
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  to raise money but by the way
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  i am going into that phase now because i
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  need to get the reporters and the crew
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  and the people to go to the next level
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  you know what makes me happier than
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  a pig in mud
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  that
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  rob do and mike adams did a report
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  together
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  with admissions of troops
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  training to confiscate guns traitorously
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  and it's better than i
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  would have probably done on one off
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  and it's going viral right now
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  troops training to kill americans
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  who refuse to turn in guns
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  it's going viral right now and you know
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  how beautiful that is not so i can shit
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  at home once i get all these reporters
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  in place but so that even
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  if you kill me it just keeps
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  going and going because the goal
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  here isn't about hanging out in new york
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  and going to the cool parties or la
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  like you little toads do and go
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  up to the bankers and you know maybe get a grant
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  or some banker money the goal here
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  is to win civilization back for humanity
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  the goal is to defeat you
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  the goal is for liberty in our time again
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  the goal is to not be slaves
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  to a soviet globalist bankster
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  collective that wants a worldwide
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  north korean type system
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  it's liberty versus dark age
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  freedom versus bondage and humiliation
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  we're not going away
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  we're committed and nothing is
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  going to shut us down except god you got
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  that nothing will stop the signal
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  you killed me
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  people see through it increases our power
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  you set me up people see through it
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  increases the power of liberty
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  you attack us people recognize it
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  and instinctively defend us you didn't
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  bankrupt the economy fast enough
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  you didn't destroy the small business
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  middle class fast enough they now
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  discovered who you are they got stupid
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  you look in all these articles
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  i mean they write articles folks
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  at media matters saying jones is insane
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  there are no drones jones is insane
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  there's no checkpoints jones is insane
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  jones is insane they're not
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  they're not putting cancer viruses
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  in the vaccines when it's all over
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000]  i mean you people are a stinking joke
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000]  i've seen media matters
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  with their media center
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000]  you know 50-something people
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  they can't put the work out of two of my crew
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  they don't get any traffic guys show them MSNBC
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  show people
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  this is alexa.com just one of the
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  rating systems okay
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000]  let me show you info wars.com
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  just one of our tentacles as you see them
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  okay
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000]  that is in the last week
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  last seven days
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  on the graph info wars.com
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  gets roughly
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  two to three times the traffic
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  of MSNBC.com
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  by the way we're always slow this time of summer
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  this is a bad time for us good time for them
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  let's show you one month oh
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  sometimes we're getting
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  six times the traffic they're getting
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  take me to the
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  three months please
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  look at that show them
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  the maximum
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  yeah
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  go to two years oh
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  MSNBC
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  MSNBC.com makes hundreds of millions a year
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  and they're tiny compared to info wars.com
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  now show them what they really hate show them
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  drudgereport.com go down the bottom
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  there's little boxes at drudgereport.com right there
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  and click compare you're watching on tv
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  and go do this yourself this is what
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  they're angry about then put in
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  think
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  they mean progress of their soviet collective takeover
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  compared to the drudgereport
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  this is a flea
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  telling an elephant
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  what to do
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  and then you back out you click compare exactly
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  this is what they're angry about
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  this is what they don't like
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  as you can see drudge is
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  quote down
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  just because less people are carrying a lexa algorithm
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  if you go to the google algorithms
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  our sites are actually up
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  and also the summer is a slower time but the point is
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  and things are driven on twitter and facebook
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  more which we're gigantic on
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  i can show you our facebook numbers
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  our facebook one of our facebook's that we don't even
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  update hardly has almost
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  as much traffic as info wars every day
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  we don't even make any money off of it
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  here go ahead and put it back we're not even trying
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  to make money okay we're in the free market
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  we can go out there
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  and right now raise all the money we need you dumb
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  twits we don't need
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  some George Soros
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  sitting there you know you know giving us some bank
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  or bailout money he got from taxpayers
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  we don't take anything from taxpayers
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  we have people that freely
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  through free association decide to buy
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  the books the videos the t-shirts
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  all of them
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  so so so there
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  look at MSNBC
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  in red down there
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  it I mean oh that's MSNBC
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  compared to drudge and they're constantly
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  telling drudge who he should link to and what he should do
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  because they're god
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  they said they were important
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  and you know what there's still a few people
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  most of their shows have about 200,000 viewers
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  when I say we have 3 million listeners a day on radio
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  that is a conservative number
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  that is that is rated
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  stations that buy arbitron
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  most about
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  half our stations don't subscribe to arbitron
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  or to the instant people meter systems
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  so that's
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  let's say it's probably more like 5
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  million a day rated
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  because we have ad agency aggregates
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  that's how genesis
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  GCN goes out and sells ads
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  3 million that's like a year ago I haven't
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  even checked we don't even sell advertisers on that
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  3 million
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  a day
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  MSNBC's top shows
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  have 800,000 and plunging
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  you're dying we're growing
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  your time is over so you're
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  desperately running around telling us small businesses are bad
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  and communism and world governments
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  good and you'll probably stage terror attacks
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  on your new globalist try to make us love you
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  so there you go
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  I mean you heard it George Soros run groups
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  say we you know Drudge, Matt Drudge
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  you stop what you're doing right now
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  George Soros said so
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  do you understand Mr
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  he says so
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  a foreigner who collaborated with the Nazis
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  publicly tells you what you better do
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  and of course he supports Obama
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  who wants to re-education camps
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  these are authoritarians
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  Hello this is Ty Bollinger author of the
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  best-selling book cancer step outside the box

[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  important information
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  in 1985 president Ronald Reagan
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  requested that carnivora be sent directly
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  to the White House at a time when only
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  the president could obtain this world-class healer
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  now 27 years later
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  carnivore capsules are used around

[01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:20.500]  Alright, I want to talk to some evil entrepreneurs.
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:23.500]  If you just joined us, Obama has said that you didn't do anything.
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:28.500]  I mean, you're worthless. Government, he says, created everything.
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:32.500]  And you're like, really? Yeah, I'll play the clip again later coming up.
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:38.500]  But just briefly, I want to thank all of our enemies and those that sent hack attacks against us,
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:42.500]  and those that try to tell media outlets not linked to our stories,
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.500]  because they want to try to control reality.
[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:46.500]  I want to tell you something.
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:51.500]  You don't control reality, and people are waking up to you very, very quickly.
[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:57.500]  But it is important for people to not just financially support us by buying t-shirts, books, videos, and things,
[01:54:57.500 --> 01:55:01.500]  and infowarshop.com or water filters, all the best products there.
[01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:06.500]  But to spread the word about the broadcast, that's where we really get the word out.
[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:14.500]  Don't let George Soros and think progress, and the White House responding to our stories about them shutting down power plants, saying we're liars.
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:20.500]  Don't let them even attempt to silence us, because that's where they want to take this, with their media takeover switches,
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:25.500]  their internet kill switches. They're a bunch of crooks that are running this federal government,
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:29.500]  and they know they're going to prison if we continue to get the word out on them,
[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:33.500]  like Nicholas Sarkozy over in France. They're not invincible.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:36.500]  We can beat these people, but you've got to take action.
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:44.500]  So prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv, get a 15-day free trial right now at prisonplanet.tv. 15 cents a day.

[01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:53.500]  We're not like the IRS that comes with a gun to take your money to give it to foreign banks that George Soros owns,
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:56:00.500]  so he can then come give it to traitorous groups here to demonize the founding fathers in America and entrepreneurs.
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:06.500]  I mean, they're a bunch of just absolute scurvy rats who've never lived in the real world,
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:11.500]  who are a bunch of authoritarian parasites strutting around saying they're liberals.
[01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:17.500]  They're not liberals. They're tyrants. Tyrants. Make me sick.
[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:21.500]  You love North Korea. You love to walk around in uniforms like the North Koreans.
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:25.500]  You love control. You people. Everybody hated you growing up.
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:27.500]  Nobody wants to be around you. You're losers.
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:34.500]  So you get together in big combines, big gangs. That's what you are, is gangs, filthy gangs.
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:41.500]  I'm sorry, Steve's been holding and then we'll get to Aaron and Brett and Doris and Ralph's up for that.
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:46.500]  Steve in North Carolina, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Are you an evil entrepreneur?
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:53.500]  Alex, great show. Of course, one evil entrepreneur speaking to another evil entrepreneur.
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:57:06.500]  You know, they don't also take the fact that we take out thousands upon tens of thousands of dollars of our own money, our savings, our whole life.
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:11.500]  No, no, no. You risk it all. You do it all. You hire people. You're bad. You're bad.
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:15.500]  Hey, hey, this is North Korea, buddy. This is what North Korea is.
[01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:22.500]  I have got a good T-shirt slogan for you. I didn't build my own debt. The government did. How about that?
[01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:29.500]  It's awesome. I mean, it's a total for the same trader media sits there and tells you the debts all yours when most of its corporate welfare.
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:40.500]  Right. I mean, you spend tens of thousands of dollars and who's bailing the small business guy out, you know? Who is? Nobody.
[01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:48.500]  I paid up my entire way through college, 100% of my own expenses, didn't get any government loans, took all my whole life savings,
[01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:53.500]  and usually 80% of us fail. And then, you know, we've got our own debt to pay.
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:58:05.500]  90% percent. It's right at 90%. 90% of all new jobs, new hires, are small business. Small business drives everything.
[01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:10.500]  And so Obama and the globalists want to sabotage the country. What do they go after?
[01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:17.500]  They got rid of our industry and so we'd be serviced. Now they're going after the service because they've got to bring you down
[01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:22.500]  so you've got to get a check from them. It's because of automation and all this.
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:30.500]  They believe they're going to be able to produce enough bobbles to keep people happy and the only new growth industry is going to be thugs to enforce all this.
[01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:37.500]  God bless you, fellow terrorist. Yeah, I mean, look, FEMA says, I'm not joking, the founding fathers are terrorists.
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:48.500]  Okay, of course, they're the terrorists, the globalists.
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:14.500]  Easy to grow heirloom seats. Yes, only $37.95. That's 70% less than our competitors.

[02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:30.500]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.500 --> 02:00:33.500]  We're going to look at drones with Rosalyn Peters of Skywatch.
[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:38.500]  She was supposed to be on last week, but she picked her phone up and there were people owned company working on it or something.
[02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:42.500]  So we'll see if that happens again, probably just an accident that's happened to me before.
[02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:46.500]  The government's tapping your phone. They call up and tell you they're going to kill you and your family.
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:52.500]  And that they were just listening to your phone conversation so you know it's the government.
[02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:58.500]  Whistleblower NSA analyzing conversations in real time.
[02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:04.500]  And that's mainstream news. Totally illegal. Everything you do in live time with computers you paid for.
[02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:09.500]  You have any idea how much that cost?
[02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:16.500]  Oh, man. And that's so if a good FBI agent or good state police are about to bust narcotics,
[02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:22.500]  trafficking, child kidnapping by the rest of the government, that they suddenly get arrested or stopped or killed.
[02:01:22.500 --> 02:01:27.500]  In fact, the state police in Texas wondered how, with the youth commission and the government rape rooms, little kids,
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:32.500]  how the PEDOs knew what they were doing before they even went out to do something.
[02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:37.500]  Because the PEDOs were on the NSA, folks. It's the kingdom of the PEDO.
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:42.500]  Haven't figured that out yet? Aaron in Nevada, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:48.500]  Thank you very much, Alex. I'm an entrepreneur. I've got a little alt-media thing I'm trying to do, you know.
[02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:53.500]  And I just wanted to clear up one thing, please.
[02:01:53.500 --> 02:01:58.500]  You thought it was me calling in Eric from Colorado or something a couple months ago or a month ago or something.
[02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:04.500]  I'm not talking to you anymore, buddy. Okay, get off my show. I'm taking calls from entrepreneurs.
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:08.500]  Let's talk to Brent and Louisiana. You're on the air, Brent. Go ahead.
[02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:11.500]  Long time listener, first-time caller, Alex.
[02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:13.500]  Hey, buddy, how you doing?
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:16.500]  Oh, working hard every day, building beautiful things.
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:21.500]  Well, I mean, tell us about your evil. Obama says you're filth.
[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:27.500]  I came down to Louisiana after their hurricane to help these people get back into their homes I've been here ever since.
[02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:36.500]  But I am a free American. I report none of my activities to any registry or taxing bureau because my private contracts are private between citizens.
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:42.500]  We need more of that. We need to just, because this system's illegitimate. If something's unconstitutional, just don't follow it.
[02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:46.500]  That's my personal view. That's what I'm starting to do.
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:54.500]  Yes, sir. I agree. I pay no income tax. I cannot morally support that when they use my money to strafe half the world with bullets and kill all kinds of people.
[02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:59.500]  Well, all the money goes to foreign banks. Ronald Reagan's own commission found that.
[02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:02.500]  Oh, yes, sir. The Blue Ribbon Panel. Yes, sir. I'm very aware.
[02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:07.500]  I am on your Planet Info Wars. Shout out to that. It is a great place to hook up.
[02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:13.500]  I've found a lot of people here in Louisiana, FEMA, Region 6. They're also fellow activists.
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:18.500]  I do have a side hobby trying to end the warrantless checkpoints in my area.
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:22.500]  I'm out there with my signed, peaceably protesting, everyone I can find.
[02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:28.500]  Oh, you're even worse than an entrepreneur. You're engaging in the American pastime of the First Amendment as well.
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:33.500]  Man, I bet Obama didn't too pleased with you because you didn't do nothing.
[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:38.500]  Going up, knocking on doors, selling business, doing a good job as a carpenter, busing your butt.
[02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:45.500]  Oh, that's how dare you. You lazy. You ought to be totally unhappy on welfare, taking Prozac.
[02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:49.500]  Then you'd be a real citizen. You piece of trash.
[02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:54.500]  A single dollar of welfare, food stamps, disability, or social security. I never will.
[02:03:54.500 --> 02:04:00.500]  I will not subscribe to that system. I am only obligated to obey the laws of the one, true and God, and Obama is not him.
[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:07.500]  Well, that's Sackler. Get that heathen off here right now, boy. You don't engage in that type of...
[02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:14.500]  Romans 13 is taught in all the major churches now. He is our Lord, our King, and our loving Savior.
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:19.500]  He will do what he says immediately.
[02:04:19.500 --> 02:04:22.500]  How dare you.
[02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:32.500]  We got Rosalind Peters off about 30 minutes or so, and then I'm going to get to evil entrepreneurs like Ralph and Marty and Doris and Jason and other.
[02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:36.500]  Just phones are open for entrepreneurs.
[02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:43.500]  I understand if you're a bureaucrat or government person, you don't know what that is, but 800-25-99-231.
[02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:47.500]  I never knew I was so dirty and bad.
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:56.500]  My brain just burns with all these different ideas and art. I want to do oil painting, photo shoots, films, work, pieces, comedy, things.
[02:04:56.500 --> 02:05:14.500]  I'm just evil. I just government. North Korea saved me.
[02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:42.500]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key. Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:46.500]  Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there. It's what my family uses.
[02:05:46.500 --> 02:05:56.500]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Propure, but if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[02:05:56.500 --> 02:06:20.500]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:29.500]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:36.500]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:41.500]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:50.500]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.500 --> 02:07:00.500]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:14.500]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Bend Soap Company. Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:21.500]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.
[02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:29.500]  See them on the web at www.5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:35.500]  Buy the one to two-month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:42.500]  Or save big with a one to two-year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs. This is an amazing deal.
[02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:47.500]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:07:47.500 --> 02:07:56.500]  See them on the web at www.5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:33.500]  You know the White House gatekeeper type folks over at Think Progress have written a big article demonizing the wicked drudge report and calling for the mainstream
[02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:39.500]  dinosaur media to take him to the woodshed for linking to evil websites like infowars.com.
[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:50.500]  Let me see what a drudge link to just from memory. We had a story about how the military is spraying bug poison on major cities in Florida
[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:58.500]  with links to the military's own admissions and CBS News and pointed out the military is taking over more and more civilian roles.
[02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:04.500]  I mean that is news, that is important, that's a real phenomenon.
[02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:11.500]  But that's a conspiracy theory because it means they don't want, again they're gatekeepers, they control reality.
[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:22.500]  When there's a new TSA video out or we interview a victim and premiere some video of them groping someone, that's the type of thing.
[02:09:22.500 --> 02:09:35.500]  But to them that's a conspiracy theory, in fact they say he's linking to conspiracy sites and it must happen. It must be shut down.
[02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:50.500]  Report, drudge, finally 30 million visitors to conspiracy websites in the last year and it goes on to say that this is a very dark horrible thing that has to be dealt with.
[02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:59.500]  Creating a powerful incentive for mainstream media to overlook the unsavory side of his operation because he gives them so much traffic too.
[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:07.500]  Again, this is the type of gatekeeping garbage. I've been covering geoengineering for 17 years on air.
[02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:14.500]  The White House scientist, John P. Holdren, the same guy that says he wants to sterilize you and your family by putting stuff in the water.
[02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:22.500]  I mean he wrote a book saying that. He says they're already geoengineering. There's all these thousands of government reports worldwide admittedly doing it.
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:31.500]  But then when I talk about it and say it's a bad thing because the fact that it's going on as public, the details are secret, it's the dissent.
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:39.500]  It's the fact that I don't want the military running checkpoints on highways because it's not what a free country has.
[02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:48.500]  I'm bad because I don't want to have unmanned drones surveilling me illegally and looking in my backyard.
[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:59.500]  In fact, Paul Watson wrote an article yesterday that I guess according to George Soros Funded Think Progress should not be up there where another George Soros type, Bill Gates,
[02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:12.500]  is giving money to a company to dump tons of sulfur dioxide linked to health problems, autoimmune disorders, you name it, on New Mexico in a geoengineering test.
[02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:18.500]  And by the way, that is admitted going on, but it doesn't exist because they said so.
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:25.500]  Gates funded experiment to spray atmosphere with sulfur particles. Geoengineering threatens to worsen droughts, starve millions.
[02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:30.500]  And of course, they say the Pentagon will use weather as a weapon. But again, I'm not supposed to talk about that.
[02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:36.500]  In fact, scroll down in the article there if you're watching on PrismPlanet.tv and you can see some of the links in there.
[02:11:36.500 --> 02:11:41.500]  The London Guardians reporting on it. But when they report, it's okay. When I report, it doesn't exist.
[02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:46.500]  Just like Think Progress and George Soros, other outfits say there is no global government.
[02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:53.500]  And if you talk about megabanks, taking over, you are evil, even though it's all over the news.
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:12:00.500]  Of course, when CNBC covers it, they say it's good. It's bad, though, when I covered it.
[02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:03.500]  It's nice to have a big ring around the sun from all the particles they're spraying on us.
[02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:07.500]  Aluminum dioxide, barium salts, a lot of the plants dying from the aluminum now.
[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:13.500]  It's a giant secret program that they admit they're doing, but again, I should just shut up.
[02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:18.500]  Marine mammals all the world dying when they have these high-powered sonar tests. I should just shut up.
[02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:25.500]  Here's another one. My taxpayer money, New American Magazine. Laser-powered drone could remain airborne forever.
[02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:31.500]  And it's a big one. Surveiling you. It was about a wingspan of about 15 feet, looks like.
[02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:36.500]  Oh, and they could even have lasers on them to blind you if you don't submit.
[02:12:36.500 --> 02:12:41.500]  Yeah, let's use our tax money so the government can arm against us. That's a great idea.
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:46.500]  And have troops domestically, even though the Declaration of Independence says that should be illegal.
[02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:51.500]  Everything, the Declaration of Independence says how great entrepreneurs are, how bad the bureaucrats can become.
[02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:57.500]  Let's get rid of that. I'm going to shut up now and go to our guest. I just wanted to introduce that.
[02:12:57.500 --> 02:13:00.500]  She was going to be on last week, but had phone trouble.
[02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:06.500]  And she joins us now, Rosalind Peterson of California Skywatch.
[02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:11.500]  She's the president and co-founder of the Agriculture Defense Coalition.
[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:17.500]  And she just does an amazing job out there. And she's been talking about the geoengineering, laymen call it chemtrailing,
[02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:20.500]  since before the government admitted they were doing it.
[02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:27.500]  And she joins us now to break down the latest on all of this and how it ties into weather mod drones,
[02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:33.500]  what's happening in the oceans, all of this, joining us right now.
[02:13:33.500 --> 02:13:35.500]  Rosalind, thank you for coming on.
[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:40.500]  Well, thank you for having me as a guest on your show today. It's a pleasure and honor to be here with you.
[02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:43.500]  There's so much to talk about. What do you want to get into first?
[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:47.500]  What do you think of Bill Gates now publicly is going to spray sulfur dioxide on us?
[02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:54.500]  Well, heaven help us because sulfur dioxide, when it comes back down to earth,
[02:13:54.500 --> 02:13:58.500]  it's going to cause air pollution, water pollution, acid rains,
[02:13:58.500 --> 02:14:02.500]  which are going to destroy our forest lands and agriculture crop production.
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:06.500]  And when they're talking about enough to have a significant experiment,
[02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:12.500]  this is going to be several megatons, I'm sure, because David Keith loves to talk
[02:14:12.500 --> 02:14:20.500]  in the form of putting megatons up there, and it can destroy beneficial atmospheric ozone.
[02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:27.500]  So I don't get why we are going to stand by and allow Bill Gates and David Keith
[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:32.500]  to pollute our water, to pollute our air, to destroy beneficial atmospheric ozone,
[02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:36.500]  just to be able to conduct an experiment.
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:43.500]  And they also say, oh, well, we think the public should finance it.
[02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:49.500]  So this was in the New York Times as they were saying, oh, well, the public should finance it.
[02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:52.500]  Well, the Council on Fine Relations came out last year and said,
[02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:56.500]  Geoengineer, everything and make us pay taxes to Bill Gates to spray us.
[02:14:56.500 --> 02:15:00.500]  He's going to control the hurricanes and stuff, but he's a very loving person.
[02:15:00.500 --> 02:15:02.500]  And of course, what's wrong with burning up the ozone layer?
[02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:04.500]  I mean, they admit that's what this does.
[02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:08.500]  It's like they're the devil and they want to destroy the planet.
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:14.500]  Well, and just who decided that just because Bill Gates happened to get lucky
[02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:18.500]  and make some money at Microsoft, that all of a sudden he should play God?
[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:24.500]  I mean, just that, to me, irritates the heck out of me that we have people
[02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:28.500]  who just because they have financial money, because they made it and got lucky,
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:32.500]  that all of a sudden they have become gods and should rule us
[02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:36.500]  and decide what kind of environment we should live in.
[02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:39.500]  You know, usually Obama's demonizing entrepreneurs that work hard
[02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:41.500]  and usually don't get lucky. It's hard work.
[02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:44.500]  But in Bill Gates's case, it actually was getting lucky.
[02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:46.500]  They were worried about antitrust laws.
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:50.500]  So IBM shut him up as a front company. They do that a lot.
[02:15:50.500 --> 02:15:54.500]  But in the case of Bill Gates, he's actually a national security level operative.
[02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:56.500]  That's why he heads all this up.
[02:15:56.500 --> 02:16:04.500]  He's actually a above ultra top secret operative.
[02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:07.500]  Whatever it is, he has no right,
[02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:11.500]  nor does anybody else have the right to go up and poison our atmosphere,
[02:16:11.500 --> 02:16:16.500]  our air, our water, our soil and put at risk the atmosphere above us
[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:20.500]  that provides life here on Earth for us.
[02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:25.500]  And so any type of geoengineering experiment, I mean, Bill Gates has talked about,
[02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:29.500]  they talk about sulfur dioxide because they want to kind of link it to volcanoes
[02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:31.500]  and say it's okay.
[02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:34.500]  But Bill Gates got on the air just the other day.
[02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:37.500]  It's on my geoengineering section of my website.
[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:41.500]  He got on and was talking about putting aluminum oxide up.
[02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:45.500]  And his research and studies is not about sulfur dioxide these days.
[02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:49.500]  It's actually about putting up aluminum oxide.
[02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:52.500]  Well, the Navy is already doing that for us.
[02:16:52.500 --> 02:16:57.500]  They put an aluminum oxide dust cloud over the eastern seaboard of the United States,
[02:16:57.500 --> 02:17:02.500]  which is coming back down to Earth to contaminate air, water and soil.
[02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:08.500]  It's called the U.S. Navy Care Charged Air Salt Release Experiment.
[02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:10.500]  It's on the NASA website.
[02:17:10.500 --> 02:17:12.500]  They're part of this as well.
[02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:14.500]  So we're already doing it.
[02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:17.500]  In other words, putting up this aluminum oxide dust cloud.
[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:19.500]  Rosalind, how do you deal with gearing?
[02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:22.500]  Exactly. How do you deal with them on C-SPAN writing books,
[02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:26.500]  thousands of Department of Energy programs, patents on adding into jet fuel,
[02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:31.500]  the skies they admit are 21% to 30% darker worldwide from the trails,
[02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:32.500]  the persistent trails.
[02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:33.500]  They're doing it.
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:36.500]  The soils everywhere, as you know, it's coming out are full of aluminum.
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:38.500]  They're saying they don't know why the plants aren't growing.
[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:39.500]  They're killing us.
[02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:44.500]  I mean, they're already doing this and then saying that they've got to bring in carbon taxes
[02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:46.500]  because of climate problems.
[02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:49.500]  But all the tests they're doing when we talk to geoengineers,
[02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:54.500]  they say that would cause droughts instead of what they claim trying to cause rain.
[02:17:54.500 --> 02:17:57.500]  It looks like they've actually weaponized things already,
[02:17:57.500 --> 02:18:00.500]  something Iran claimed two days ago.
[02:18:00.500 --> 02:18:01.500]  Well, certainly.
[02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:08.500]  And the U.S. Air Force has been working on owning the weather since the 1990s
[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:13.500]  and to think that they're not going to use weather as a way to coerce other countries
[02:18:13.500 --> 02:18:19.500]  into doing what we want or testing it on the population here to raise food prices.
[02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:20.500]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:28.500]  And we've got 66 ongoing weather modification programs ongoing across the United States here
[02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:33.500]  and according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
[02:18:33.500 --> 02:18:41.500]  And on top of that, we have 169 weather modification projects going on worldwide
[02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:46.500]  and to say, well, everything is caused by climate change and warming.
[02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:52.500]  Well, there are studies now that show that the jets leaving these contrails in our skies
[02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:54.500]  are warming us up.
[02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:58.500]  It's causing warming in the Arctic and melting in the Arctic.
[02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:03.500]  And so when you start to talk about, well, we need to do something about global warming.
[02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:07.500]  Well, let's take care of the jets and stop the man-made cloud production,
[02:19:07.500 --> 02:19:09.500]  which changes our climate.
[02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:16.500]  I mean, NASA, Stanford University studies, all of this are very clear that the water vapor
[02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:24.500]  released by the jets are warming us up artificially and that the Alaska melting
[02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:29.500]  so that they can exploit the natural resources like Shell and Alaska and other countries
[02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:35.500]  can exploit and drill in the Arctic is needed because they can't get in if those areas are frozen.
[02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:42.500]  Oh, this has political and all kinds of ramifications much further than most people really realize.
[02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:45.500]  But, well, of course, the control freaks want to control the weather.
[02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:47.500]  They call it owning the weather. It's a Pentagon document.
[02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:49.500]  They admit they're already weather weaponizing.
[02:19:49.500 --> 02:19:51.500]  They're attacking us to bankrupt us.

[02:22:03.500 --> 02:22:08.500]  and one of the biggest is that men are losing libido or sexual desire, especially if you're a man over 40.
[02:22:08.500 --> 02:22:11.500]  The problem could be declining testosterone levels.

[02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:17.500]  The interest is up and the stock market's down
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:21.500]  and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[02:24:21.500 --> 02:24:24.500]  Yeah, but if you think you're gonna grow some food in that backyard,
[02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:27.500]  not for long, the aluminum's going up.
[02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:31.500]  Don't worry, Big Agra's got new seeds that can grow in aluminum.
[02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:36.500]  Oh, what a business plan.
[02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:44.500]  They got drones for that.
[02:24:44.500 --> 02:24:49.500]  And the best part is you're gonna pay for it all with your tax money.
[02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:54.500]  Oh, no, you can't.
[02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:57.500]  They have the new EPA enforcers, any dust,
[02:24:57.500 --> 02:25:01.500]  multi-thousand-dollar fines, including hay dust.
[02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:07.500]  Oh, the will commissions are gonna inspect
[02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:11.500]  and stop that with the animal eddy premises eddy.
[02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:17.500]  All right, that's enough for me.
[02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:21.500]  But here's the best part, crank it up right here and we'll go to our guest.
[02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:24.500]  One thing left, it's our guns.
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:27.500]  They're gonna get those too, don't you worry.
[02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:37.500]  Bitter clingers, we say grace.
[02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:39.500]  We say amen.
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:42.500]  Let's go back to our guest.
[02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:45.500]  Good old Hank Williams Jr.
[02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:48.500]  Rosalind Peterson, give out your websites.
[02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:52.500]  There's so much more on those and continue what the first and foremost threat is.
[02:25:52.500 --> 02:25:55.500]  Because, you know, they've gone from denying all this to just,
[02:25:55.500 --> 02:25:58.500]  yeah, we're gonna be spraying you in your town.
[02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:00.500]  Yeah, we're gonna control the climate now.
[02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:02.500]  We're not gonna tell you the details.
[02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:05.500]  We're gonna spray some aluminum on you, but just sit down and shut up.
[02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:09.500]  And by the way, Fukushima's good for you.
[02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:12.500]  I absolutely agree with you.
[02:26:12.500 --> 02:26:17.500]  Fukushima is not going down the right path at all in any direction.
[02:26:17.500 --> 02:26:21.500]  And you know, what bothers me here is how did the Air Force get into the business
[02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:26.500]  of spraying to kill mosquitoes with C-130 aircraft?
[02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:28.500]  It's all conditioning us.
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:31.500]  But look at what they're putting on us.
[02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:34.500]  They're putting on us a carcinogen.
[02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:36.500]  Not a possible carcinogen.
[02:26:36.500 --> 02:26:40.500]  A listed carcinogen, especially for men, but a carcinogen.
[02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:43.500]  And they're spraying it to kill mosquitoes.
[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:45.500]  Now think about this.
[02:26:45.500 --> 02:26:49.500]  What they're spraying is toxic to birds, fish.
[02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:54.500]  It's toxic to all of the natural predators of mosquitoes.
[02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:57.500]  So it's gonna kill the natural predators off.
[02:26:57.500 --> 02:27:00.500]  And it's gonna give everyone sprayed cancer,
[02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:03.500]  because eventually you're gonna be breathing this.
[02:27:03.500 --> 02:27:04.500]  Your kids will breathe it.
[02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:06.500]  People are gonna get sick.
[02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:10.500]  And here's the label for Dibrom or Naled,
[02:27:10.500 --> 02:27:14.500]  which the Air Force is spraying on Florida as we speak.
[02:27:14.500 --> 02:27:19.500]  It says, emergency overview, danger, poison, corrosive,
[02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:22.500]  clear amber liquid with a sharp pungent odor
[02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:25.500]  that causes irreversible eye and skin damage,
[02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:30.500]  maybe fatal of swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin and eyes.
[02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:33.500]  Rapidly absorbed through the skin, repeated irritation,
[02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:36.500]  or skin contact may without symptoms,
[02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:40.500]  progressively increases susceptibility to organophosphate poisoning.
[02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:44.500]  Maybe an aspiration hazard may cause an allergic reaction.
[02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:49.500]  The product is combustible and toxic to fish, birds, and other wildlife.
[02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:53.500]  Now just look at what they're spraying on the residents of Florida
[02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:57.500]  with a C-130 cargo plane that can spray
[02:27:57.500 --> 02:28:01.500]  an unlimited amount of this chemical over everything.
[02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:05.500]  They're spraying your homes, your backyards, they're spraying everything.
[02:28:05.500 --> 02:28:08.500]  Oh, but it's because they never did it before,
[02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:10.500]  but now they are and it's no big deal.
[02:28:10.500 --> 02:28:16.500]  Aluminum, barium, radioactive isotopes, bug poison.
[02:28:16.500 --> 02:28:20.500]  I mean, they are loving us right now.
[02:28:20.500 --> 02:28:22.500]  Well, sure, because we're putting up with it
[02:28:22.500 --> 02:28:25.500]  and we're just being their guinea pigs for their experiments.
[02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:28.500]  Well, you know, cancer and Alzheimer's and all the other diseases are off the charts.
[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:32.500]  And this is, we ought to, like Obama said, everything good comes from government.
[02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:36.500]  And I think, Rosalind Peterson, that you should get down on your knees
[02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:40.500]  and thank them for chemtrailing you right now.
[02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:42.500]  Why is that?
[02:28:42.500 --> 02:28:46.500]  Well, you're not an extremist, are you?
[02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:53.500]  No, but I object to being poisoned without having to say in what they're doing.
[02:28:53.500 --> 02:29:01.500]  I object to being subjected to some company having me have genetically modified mosquitoes
[02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:05.500]  and that are going to infect us and kill the population.
[02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:08.500]  Now, now, now, now, it's not that bad.
[02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:10.500]  It isn't?
[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:16.500]  No, I mean, so what a pediatric cancer is up over 10,000% and breast cancer up over 2,000%.
[02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:18.500]  I mean, so what if people are dying left and right?
[02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:23.500]  So they did secret testing on troops thousands of times killing them with nerve gas.
[02:29:23.500 --> 02:29:27.500]  Rosalind, I mean, these are good people running things.
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:29.500]  You didn't hear Obama's speech.
[02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:32.500]  He said everything good comes from the government.
[02:29:32.500 --> 02:29:35.500]  Well, not that particular one, no.
[02:29:35.500 --> 02:29:37.500]  All right, listen, let's get into sonar.
[02:29:37.500 --> 02:29:38.500]  You've been looking heavily into that.
[02:29:38.500 --> 02:29:41.500]  They're not only helping us, they're helping the marine mammals
[02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:44.500]  and releasing GMO salmon that will extinct the other ones.
[02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:45.500]  They admit.
[02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:47.500]  So there's more good news straight ahead.
[02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:48.500]  Thank you, Obama.
[02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:49.500]  Thank you, New World Order.
[02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:51.500]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.500 --> 02:29:53.500]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:32:56.500 --> 02:33:01.500]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:01.500 --> 02:33:26.500]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.500 --> 02:34:00.500]  That's right, Shooter Jennings.
[02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:07.500]  Now your daddy's proud of you looking down from Valhalla.
[02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:10.500]  By the way, I want to get Shooter Jennings back on the show.
[02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:16.500]  We're very close. We're getting a super iconic country legend on the show who is a listener.
[02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:18.500]  So look for that very, very soon.
[02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:25.500]  And Dave Mustaine's coming to visit me this weekend here in Austin.
[02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:26.500]  We're good friends.
[02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:28.500]  He comes to visit us every few months.
[02:34:28.500 --> 02:34:31.500]  I might get a special interview with him on a bunch of subjects who knows.
[02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:33.500]  Not name-dropping, but it is important to name-drop a bit
[02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:39.500]  because it shows so many famous and popular people are tuned in or are tuning into reality.
[02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:42.500]  The awakening is happening and those are bellwethers.
[02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:44.500]  We're going to go back to our guest here in just a moment.
[02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:48.500]  We're going to have the head of the American Small Business Bureau.
[02:34:48.500 --> 02:34:51.500]  Will you guys give me his bio, please? Thank you.
[02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:55.500]  Coming on the show briefly at the end to give us his take on Obama's statements
[02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:58.500]  about entrepreneurs are the problem, not the solution.
[02:34:58.500 --> 02:35:02.500]  Government lays the golden eggs.
[02:35:02.500 --> 02:35:04.500]  Even the Easter Bunny is sent out by the government.
[02:35:04.500 --> 02:35:06.500]  Everything is Santa Claus as well.
[02:35:06.500 --> 02:35:11.500]  But, you know, notice that George Soros funded Think Progress and Media Matters
[02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:14.500]  are all freaking out that Drudge links to infowars.com
[02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:19.500]  and tells the media to take him to task as if that will punish Drudge.
[02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:20.500]  You can't take him to task.
[02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:23.500]  All Drudge does is link to a wide spectrum of news,
[02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:27.500]  government documents, whatever it is.
[02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:29.500]  I mean, it's an aggregating site.
[02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:31.500]  There's nothing you can take away from it.
[02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:34.500]  I mean, all you do with demonizing him is making cooler
[02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:38.500]  because you guys are so uncool, so untrusted, so disliked
[02:35:38.500 --> 02:35:43.500]  that when you attack somebody, that's the seal of approval.
[02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:44.500]  And you figure that out.
[02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:47.500]  That's why you've got internet kill switches and reeducation centers set up.
[02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:48.500]  And you're very upset.
[02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:52.500]  It scares you that any day we could put an article out at infowars.com
[02:35:52.500 --> 02:35:54.500]  and you can't gatekeep it.
[02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:57.500]  Even if Drudge wasn't there, our listeners are able to punch stuff out
[02:35:57.500 --> 02:35:58.500]  and get it out there.
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:00.500]  Drudge supercharges that.
[02:36:00.500 --> 02:36:04.500]  They talk about how horrible it is that this is funding infowars.
[02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:08.500]  Really, it's a small part of it, but you can believe it's a big part of it if you want.
[02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:11.500]  What's funding it is subscriptionstoprisonplanet.tv.
[02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:13.500]  Let me just give you a little newsflash.
[02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:15.500]  Sponsors on radio.
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:20.500]  We're on hundreds of radio stations and sponsors on internet.
[02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:27.500]  And books and videos and things we sell.
[02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:30.500]  And then any time I need to, I don't like to,
[02:36:30.500 --> 02:36:33.500]  government loves to come give you new tax and four-shit gunpoint to do something,
[02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:35.500]  we can go to our listeners and get money.
[02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:38.500]  Which, you know, we're going to do a money bomb this year because, you know,
[02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:41.500]  we need to hire more people, get stuff running better.
[02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:42.500]  So don't worry.
[02:36:42.500 --> 02:36:45.500]  For all of the tractors, we'll do a big 48-hour marathon.
[02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:47.500]  We want to go 24 hours straight.
[02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:50.500]  We'll go 48 hours live broadcast.
[02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:54.500]  And I'm going to use this for fundraising here, the fact that you want to shut our funding off.
[02:36:54.500 --> 02:36:58.500]  And I predict this year, even though we're in the engineer depression,
[02:36:58.500 --> 02:37:04.500]  we'll be one of the big, we'll be the, I bet we're going to get double any previous money bomb.
[02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:07.500]  Because I'm just going to point out you don't want us around.
[02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:08.500]  How do you like that?
[02:37:08.500 --> 02:37:12.500]  See, George Soros gets banker bailout money and government contract money.
[02:37:12.500 --> 02:37:16.500]  I've analyzed it and then goes and funds anti-American globalist takeovers.
[02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:18.500]  We just said there to the American people and say,
[02:37:18.500 --> 02:37:21.500]  if you support us, buy our books and videos at infowareshop.com.
[02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:24.500]  Now, I'm pretty wound up today, Rosalind Peterson.
[02:37:24.500 --> 02:37:27.500]  I know you come on the nightly news quite a bit and just do invaluable work
[02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:29.500]  and three or four minutes finishing up here.
[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:33.500]  And we look forward to getting you back on the news commercial free soon.
[02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:36.500]  Tell us about the websites, the sonar issues.
[02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:37.500]  What else you're looking at?
[02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:41.500]  Because I don't know anybody out there more on, you know, the sky watch of what's happening
[02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:43.500]  and what you're dealing with.
[02:37:43.500 --> 02:37:52.500]  Well, anyone can go to agriculturedefensecoalition.org or Californiaskywatch.com.
[02:37:52.500 --> 02:37:55.500]  There's a category section that interlinks them.
[02:37:55.500 --> 02:38:01.500]  And you can look up any of the sections and any of the issues that we've talked about here today
[02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:04.500]  and find the government documents, the studies, the research.
[02:38:04.500 --> 02:38:08.500]  Ten years of it is on the two websites.
[02:38:08.500 --> 02:38:15.500]  And you can find all of the government documents and the information about what we were talking about here today.
[02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:23.500]  I want to encourage everyone to go to the US Navy section because the US Navy has decided
[02:38:23.500 --> 02:38:29.500]  that they're going to increase the number of their exercises or expand the areas in which they may occur
[02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:33.500]  in the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico
[02:38:33.500 --> 02:38:40.500]  and that virtually every coastal state will be affected by their five-year warfare testing exercises,
[02:38:40.500 --> 02:38:43.500]  new weapons testing experiments, et cetera.
[02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:50.500]  And this is over land areas as well as in all of our ocean areas surrounding the United States
[02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:56.500]  and in the island areas like the Marianas near Guam and in the Hawaiian Islands.
[02:38:56.500 --> 02:38:59.500]  And they're going to make the ranges so big.
[02:38:59.500 --> 02:39:04.500]  You can go to my website at the US Navy and look at the US Navy map
[02:39:04.500 --> 02:39:11.500]  and you'll see their map and the range of extension on the Atlantic side of the ocean
[02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:18.500]  goes from the state of Maine and up where the Canadian border is all the way down to Florida
[02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:22.500]  and then an extension to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:31.500]  This is for weapons training, bomb blasts, 5,000-pound bombs, 1,000-pound bombs, 500-pound bombs,
[02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:42.500]  sonar testing, chemical testing, laser testing, Q, magnetic type of testing, radars, sonars, lasers,
[02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:44.500]  you name it, they're going to be testing it.
[02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:47.500]  And they're going to be testing it on our marine mammal.
[02:39:47.500 --> 02:39:55.500]  11.7 million are going to be disrupted and the Navy wants to practice in every national marine sanctuary,
[02:39:55.500 --> 02:40:02.500]  marine reserve, biologically sensitive area, and to use sonar while the whales are migrating.
[02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:08.500]  It's going to be a holocaust in our oceans with shock and awe as the end result.
[02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:13.500]  And this is war testing. This is war practice and war testing.
[02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:21.500]  The United States Navy has decided to go to war on the oceans of the world, all around us,
[02:40:21.500 --> 02:40:25.500]  and to conduct a massacre in the name of war practice.
[02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:32.500]  Now, they're going to be going all the way from the Gulf of Alaska down to Southern California,
[02:40:32.500 --> 02:40:36.500]  all the way across to the Hawaiian Islands and to the Mariana Islands,
[02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:40.500]  testing inside or outside the various ranges.
[02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:45.500]  And I'm going to tell you the holocaust that is going to be committed on the marine mammals,
[02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:50.500]  the fish, the coral reefs from the bomb blasts, the missiles.
[02:40:50.500 --> 02:40:57.500]  And I'm going to tell you, this is all live fire. This is no just ordinary practice.
[02:40:57.500 --> 02:41:02.500]  Well, you've got to spray bug poison on all the major cities as corporate welfare,
[02:41:02.500 --> 02:41:06.500]  and you've got to buy more bombs so you can expend them, and you've got to bankrupt the taxpayers somehow.
[02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:08.500]  Of course.
[02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:10.500]  Yeah.
[02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:16.500]  And they're well on their way, and I'm going to tell you that the poisons that they're going to put in the atmosphere
[02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:22.500]  with the aluminum oxide testing and the trimethyl aluminum testing and atmospheric testing
[02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:26.500]  and all this other things they're doing, and you can read online.
[02:41:26.500 --> 02:41:31.500]  Go to the US Navy websites. I put them online. You can read the environmental impact statement.
[02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:35.500]  You can read exactly what they intend to do and when they're going to do it
[02:41:35.500 --> 02:41:42.500]  many ranges are now in operation, and the nuclear power drones they're talking about.
[02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:44.500]  Wonderful. I love nuclear power things falling out of the sky.
[02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:47.500]  Well, you've been seeing all these articles. The London Guardian was a new one this week.
[02:41:47.500 --> 02:41:52.500]  Another environmentalist said radiation is good because it gets rid of humans.
[02:41:52.500 --> 02:41:58.500]  There was actually a big article out praising radiation in Chernobyl because it ran the humans out.
[02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:02.500]  I mean, come on. Don't be an extremist. Radiation is loving.
[02:42:02.500 --> 02:42:06.500]  Well, listen, I really appreciate you joining us, Rosalind Peterson,
[02:42:06.500 --> 02:42:10.500]  and we'll talk to you very soon from Skywatch, California. God bless you.
[02:42:10.500 --> 02:42:11.500]  Okay. Thank you.
[02:42:11.500 --> 02:42:12.500]  Thank you. There she goes.
[02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:17.500]  All right. I want to continue here in a minute with Obama again in case you missed it,
[02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:21.500]  saying that small business owners are nobodies.
[02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:26.500]  I mean, you're actually the slugs. You're the people holding things back.
[02:42:26.500 --> 02:42:28.500]  You're the problem. You didn't do anything.
[02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:33.500]  Okay. And just like government created heaven in North Korea, it's going to create it here.
[02:42:33.500 --> 02:42:38.500]  You better learn that. Here's some of the other news that we have some good news.
[02:42:38.500 --> 02:42:45.500]  Texas Republican Party calls for mandatory GMO labeling legalized raw milk, complete elimination of TSA.
[02:42:45.500 --> 02:42:54.500]  That is now in the official voted on planks of the Republican Party that the patriots have taken over here in Texas.
[02:42:54.500 --> 02:43:00.500]  So there you go. At least the Republican Party on the surface can be co-opted if we take it off.
[02:43:00.500 --> 02:43:04.500]  Democratic Party is dedicated. It's got a lot of well-meaning idiots in it,
[02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:09.500]  but dedicated to collectivism, which only creates nightmare scenarios.
[02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:14.500]  Continuing, North Korea's new hereditary dictator cements control over the army,
[02:43:14.500 --> 02:43:17.500]  and I guess that's all that matters. They don't have many vehicles that actually run,
[02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:19.500]  but they do have fancy uniforms.
[02:43:19.500 --> 02:43:25.500]  Kim Jong-un is something very special on the nightly news.
[02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:30.500]  Like I endorsed Obama, the videos at m4.com, it is shat tire folks.
[02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:35.500]  Well, tonight I'm going to, if I'm going to endorse Obama, why not really endorse total government?
[02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:44.500]  I am going to kneel to Kim Jong-un tonight, and this is going to be some very special time we're going to spend worshipping.
[02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:47.500]  Tonight on the nightly news, you don't want to miss that.
[02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:50.500]  Chavez accused of eroding rights financial times.
[02:43:50.500 --> 02:43:54.500]  Oh, really? Just taking everybody's businesses and putting all those little parasites over them?
[02:43:54.500 --> 02:43:58.500]  It's not enough to just pay all the welfare out to the corporations and other people.
[02:43:58.500 --> 02:44:00.500]  They have to have your business taken over. You're thrown out.
[02:44:00.500 --> 02:44:07.500]  Olympic opening ceremony slash by half an hour over fears of G4S security shambles
[02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:10.500]  could cause chaos and for spectators.
[02:44:10.500 --> 02:44:14.500]  Oh, three weeks ago, four weeks ago, we the conspiracy theorist broke all this
[02:44:14.500 --> 02:44:18.500]  with a well-known filmmaker who infiltrated, but we're just the conspiracy theorist.
[02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:22.500]  See, we don't get Pulitzer Prizes. We're just called conspiracy theorist.
[02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:27.500]  Daily Mail now reporting on that and show is London Guardian.
[02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:33.500]  Olympic security MOD prepares to call up 2,000 more troops for G4S shortfall.
[02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:38.500]  There you go. The military as we also told you, taking over that entire operation.
[02:44:38.500 --> 02:44:41.500]  But again, we're just right about it again.
[02:44:41.500 --> 02:44:45.500]  We don't get a pat on the back or anything for that. We get in trouble.
[02:44:45.500 --> 02:44:48.500]  Hey, I saw this. We're going to post this up at infowars.com.
[02:44:48.500 --> 02:44:54.500]  Down on South Congress at the Ben White Flores, they posted South Congress hookers,
[02:44:54.500 --> 02:44:56.500]  Welcome Secret Service.
[02:44:56.500 --> 02:44:59.500]  And we had our reporters down there yesterday. This is a real photo.
[02:44:59.500 --> 02:45:01.500]  We're going to have video tonight.
[02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:06.500]  Ben White Flores Soko Hooker's Welcome Secret Service. I like that.
[02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:10.500]  You know, the Secret Service a lot of times comes in. We've confirmed and goes into areas
[02:45:10.500 --> 02:45:13.500]  and says, take down your political sign for the rival.
[02:45:13.500 --> 02:45:17.500]  They did that for Bush and now they're going to do it for Obama, I guess.
[02:45:17.500 --> 02:45:22.500]  But how about Soko Hooker's Welcome Secret Service? I like that.
[02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:25.500]  Okay, continuing here with the news.
[02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:28.500]  I noticed some comments on Info Wars and Prison Planet saying,
[02:45:28.500 --> 02:45:31.500]  hey, cover the Sheriff Joe Arpaio thing more.
[02:45:31.500 --> 02:45:33.500]  Well, I mean, we did.
[02:45:33.500 --> 02:45:41.500]  Redlinkedinfowars.com, National Security Threat, Obama birth certificate proven fraudulent.
[02:45:41.500 --> 02:45:45.500]  And look, I don't have a dog in this fight.
[02:45:45.500 --> 02:45:47.500]  I didn't get into the barter stuff four years ago.
[02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:51.500]  I went and looked at the document. It's fake.
[02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:54.500]  It's a fake computer font that's supposed to look like typewriter font.
[02:45:54.500 --> 02:45:59.500]  How do I know that? Every typewriter strike is different like a snowflake.
[02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:02.500]  Okay, or like a fingerprint because they splat down differently.
[02:46:02.500 --> 02:46:04.500]  How hard you push, okay?
[02:46:04.500 --> 02:46:07.500]  That's what's going on. That's what's happening.
[02:46:07.500 --> 02:46:11.500]  So that's the reality and it's fake.
[02:46:11.500 --> 02:46:13.500]  It's fake. It's totally fake.
[02:46:13.500 --> 02:46:16.500]  And they basically found the same things.
[02:46:16.500 --> 02:46:20.500]  And folks, no one was called African or African American in 1961.
[02:46:20.500 --> 02:46:22.500]  That didn't start until the 80s.
[02:46:22.500 --> 02:46:24.500]  That's all been confirmed.
[02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:26.500]  That's on record.
[02:46:26.500 --> 02:46:29.500]  That's happening. That's going on.
[02:46:29.500 --> 02:46:33.500]  That's the reality.
[02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:35.500]  That's what's happening here, okay?
[02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:42.500]  And our pile, Obama birth record, definitely fraudulent, AP.
[02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:46.500]  So the system's very upset about that and we'll be covering it tonight
[02:46:46.500 --> 02:46:48.500]  because no one believes you anymore.
[02:46:48.500 --> 02:46:52.500]  Now, again, we were thrown off because all of his publications,
[02:46:52.500 --> 02:46:57.500]  all of his reports, all of his everything, said he was born in Kenya.
[02:46:57.500 --> 02:46:59.500]  He himself, his wife said that.
[02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:02.500]  But that was the cover. It's Frank Marshall Davis.
[02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:05.500]  So that's why we have these fake and doctored birth certificates.
[02:47:05.500 --> 02:47:07.500]  It turns out he was born in Hawaii probably.
[02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:12.500]  It's just we're giving fake birth certificates because it is father-unknown on there.
[02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:16.500]  And that's what this one shows. They doctored that out because the marks are father-unknown.
[02:47:16.500 --> 02:47:18.500]  But then it says father-known.
[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:20.500]  Point is, is that it's as funny as $3 bill.
[02:47:20.500 --> 02:47:22.500]  We don't even know exactly who he is.
[02:47:22.500 --> 02:47:26.500]  98% chance Frank Marshall Davis.
[02:47:26.500 --> 02:47:28.500]  Now, I want to just briefly, I want to get him to pop in.
[02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:31.500]  We're going to go a little bit into overdrive to take small business owners
[02:47:31.500 --> 02:47:33.500]  that have been holding patiently like Ralph and others.
[02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:39.500]  But Lloyd Chapman, ASBL.com, frequent guest, fellow Texan work for Bob Bullock here.
[02:47:39.500 --> 02:47:42.500]  He's pointed out they criminally divert most of the funds
[02:47:42.500 --> 02:47:46.500]  that are supposed to go to small businesses in bids to multinationals and globalists.
[02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:49.500]  They have blacklist. He sued them countless times in one.
[02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:51.500]  He exposes this. I briefly wanted to get him on.
[02:47:51.500 --> 02:47:53.500]  Play the clip of Obama, please.
[02:47:53.500 --> 02:47:58.500]  There's Obama saying that if you have a small business, you didn't do Jack Diddley squat.
[02:47:58.500 --> 02:48:03.500]  So now not only are small businesses not on the radar, now it's bad.
[02:48:03.500 --> 02:48:07.500]  In fact, you abuse somebody's labor to even have a small business.
[02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:10.500]  You piece of filth. There it is.
[02:48:10.500 --> 02:48:13.500]  If you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own.
[02:48:13.500 --> 02:48:18.500]  I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart.
[02:48:18.500 --> 02:48:21.500]  There are a lot of smart people out there.
[02:48:21.500 --> 02:48:23.500]  It must be because I worked harder than everybody else.
[02:48:23.500 --> 02:48:27.500]  Let me tell you something. There are a whole bunch of hard-working people out there.
[02:48:27.500 --> 02:48:33.500]  If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help.
[02:48:33.500 --> 02:48:37.500]  There was a great teacher somewhere in your life.
[02:48:37.500 --> 02:48:44.500]  Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we had that allowed you to thrive.
[02:48:44.500 --> 02:48:46.500]  Somebody invested in roads and bridges.
[02:48:46.500 --> 02:48:53.500]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.
[02:48:53.500 --> 02:48:58.500]  The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet
[02:48:58.500 --> 02:49:02.500]  so that all the companies couldn't make money off the Internet.
[02:49:02.500 --> 02:49:07.500]  Okay. Now, again, this is a guy that gives the contracts to offshore cronies
[02:49:07.500 --> 02:49:09.500]  to shut American business down.
[02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:12.500]  And the crowd's cheering when they hear about small businesses being bad.
[02:49:12.500 --> 02:49:16.500]  Like, remember, there's a riot or whatever? The small businesses all get burned down.
[02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:21.500]  Let me tell you, he knows what he's doing. He used to run stuff in Chicago.
[02:49:21.500 --> 02:49:24.500]  He's saying, hey, small businesses, they're going to burn, baby.
[02:49:24.500 --> 02:49:26.500]  And it's like, you bet they are.
[02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:30.500]  This is the screwball level this has come to.
[02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:32.500]  What do you make of this Lloyd Chapman?
[02:49:32.500 --> 02:49:38.500]  What do you make of now the open assault on the almost extinct small business?
[02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:43.500]  Oh, you know, I like to make dramatic statements and back them up with irrefutable fact.
[02:49:43.500 --> 02:49:45.500]  And here's my dramatic statement.
[02:49:45.500 --> 02:49:50.500]  Barack Obama is one of the most anti-small business presidents in U.S. history.
[02:49:50.500 --> 02:49:55.500]  Fact number one, on February of 2008, he released a statement and said,
[02:49:55.500 --> 02:49:59.500]  it's time to end the diversion of federal small business contracts to corporate giants.
[02:49:59.500 --> 02:50:03.500]  So he admitted it was a problem. He admitted he knew about it and he promised to stop it.
[02:50:03.500 --> 02:50:08.500]  The most recent data released by the SBA about July 3rd,
[02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:13.500]  showed that of the top 100 recipients of federal small business contracts from the Obama administration,
[02:50:13.500 --> 02:50:17.500]  70 are large businesses, including Fin Mechanica,
[02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:22.500]  a defense contractor owned by the Italian government,
[02:50:22.500 --> 02:50:26.500]  that's getting hundreds of millions of U.S. government small business contracts.
[02:50:26.500 --> 02:50:31.500]  About two years ago, I sued the Obama administration when he removed the parent company,
[02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:35.500]  a done in Bradstreet number from the government's database of suppliers,
[02:50:35.500 --> 02:50:40.500]  which was how federal investigators and people like me and you could see who really owns the company.
[02:50:40.500 --> 02:50:44.500]  Is this a real small business or is this a front for some watch corporation?
[02:50:44.500 --> 02:50:47.500]  He removed that from the database so you couldn't tell.
[02:50:47.500 --> 02:50:49.500]  Yeah, folks, you wonder why the economy is shutting down.
[02:50:49.500 --> 02:50:53.500]  They're paying to move your jobs. They're not just leaving. They want them gone.
[02:50:53.500 --> 02:51:01.500]  So you're on welfare under their control. Stay there. We'll talk about it.
[02:51:23.500 --> 02:51:26.500]  Allowing you to preserve your fuel storage for rainy days.
[02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:30.500]  Sun baked foods stay moisture and have less shrinkage and do not burn.

[02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:13.500]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House

[02:54:19.500 --> 02:54:27.500]  I'm not even supporting Romney folks.
[02:54:27.500 --> 02:54:33.500]  Obama is so bad to come out and say, if you have a small business, you didn't build that.
[02:54:33.500 --> 02:54:34.500]  You didn't do that.
[02:54:34.500 --> 02:54:38.500]  Implying that you don't have crew that get paid or crew that get promoted.
[02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:45.500]  It's like saying that the workers and the government are together against the business owner.
[02:54:45.500 --> 02:54:50.500]  When it's the big mega business owners that actually have gained the whole thing for corporate welfare
[02:54:50.500 --> 02:54:52.500]  and to get all the small business contracts.
[02:54:52.500 --> 02:54:56.500]  Because yeah, the American system, I guess you could say, is some government contracts
[02:54:56.500 --> 02:54:58.500]  to small businesses with the tax money.
[02:54:58.500 --> 02:55:03.500]  But that system's out the window, but then Obama runs around talking about it.
[02:55:03.500 --> 02:55:06.500]  Lloyd Chapman of the American Small Business League.
[02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:09.500]  What do you make of this?
[02:55:09.500 --> 02:55:15.500]  Yeah, it's stunning that this isn't on the front page of every newspaper in the country.
[02:55:15.500 --> 02:55:18.500]  America's the worst economic downturn in 80 years.
[02:55:18.500 --> 02:55:23.500]  We know from the U.S. Census Bureau data that small businesses create over 90% of all net new jobs.
[02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:27.500]  We've got a president who's attacking small businesses and diverting the federal funds
[02:55:27.500 --> 02:55:31.500]  that by law should go to them to the biggest companies on earth.
[02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:38.500]  I simply can't believe that this is not on every television station and at every newspaper in the country.
[02:55:38.500 --> 02:55:40.500]  It's just shocking.
[02:55:40.500 --> 02:55:42.500]  More evidence of Barack Obama is anti-small businesses.
[02:55:42.500 --> 02:55:46.500]  That's why I got to go to federal court every day of the week getting information from the Obama administration
[02:55:46.500 --> 02:55:49.500]  about who's getting these federal small business contracts.
[02:55:49.500 --> 02:55:52.500]  It's supposed to be public, but they're trying to make it secret.
[02:55:52.500 --> 02:55:55.500]  And you narrowly defeated a blacklist they had.
[02:55:55.500 --> 02:55:56.500]  Oh yeah.
[02:55:56.500 --> 02:55:58.500]  But that's still being implemented secretly.
[02:55:58.500 --> 02:55:59.500]  Oh yeah.
[02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:06.500]  In fact, to take something funny, I have a friend that does business with the government
[02:56:06.500 --> 02:56:10.500]  and he's one of my supporters and he was doing business with a government contractor
[02:56:10.500 --> 02:56:18.500]  and some purchasing agent sort of unknowingly told him that there was a note in there to blacklist his company.
[02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:20.500]  And the guy didn't understand.
[02:56:20.500 --> 02:56:24.500]  He was looking at this screen while he was talking to a friend of mine.
[02:56:24.500 --> 02:56:31.500]  But the truth is what small businesses need to do is stand together and object to this.
[02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:37.500]  And you know, it's a hundred billion dollars a year.
[02:56:37.500 --> 02:56:40.500]  They're supposed to go to small businesses and it's not happening.
[02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:44.500]  Funny thing is the Obama administration released the information July 3rd.
[02:56:44.500 --> 02:56:48.500]  They're claiming that they gave a hundred billion dollars over a hundred big to small businesses.
[02:56:48.500 --> 02:56:53.500]  Yet they released it secretly to a small group of journalists.
[02:56:53.500 --> 02:56:56.500]  You know, President Obama didn't go on national television to talk about it.
[02:56:56.500 --> 02:56:57.500]  He knows it.
[02:56:57.500 --> 02:56:58.500]  It is what media scrutiny.
[02:56:58.500 --> 02:57:02.500]  But if the Obama administration actually gave a hundred billion dollars to small businesses,
[02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:03.500]  you'd think he'd issue a press release.
[02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:05.500]  He'd be on television talking about it.
[02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:06.500]  He hasn't mentioned it.
[02:57:06.500 --> 02:57:11.500]  So just notice Barack Obama has not mentioned that July 3rd, his administration...
[02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:14.500]  Well, of course. I mean, almost all the bailout money goes to offshore corporations.
[02:57:14.500 --> 02:57:16.500]  That's the plan.
[02:57:16.500 --> 02:57:21.500]  And once we're fully imploded, they can all come back in and buy the country up for pennies on the dollar.
[02:57:21.500 --> 02:57:24.500]  Yep. It's unbelievable.
[02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:26.500]  By the way, you can't get this story in the mainstream media.
[02:57:26.500 --> 02:57:27.500]  I'll tell you something, Alex.
[02:57:27.500 --> 02:57:32.500]  I did an interview with CBS, NBC, and The Washington Post.
[02:57:32.500 --> 02:57:34.500]  Those stories didn't run.
[02:57:34.500 --> 02:57:36.500]  They were supposed to run on certain dates.
[02:57:36.500 --> 02:57:37.500]  They didn't run.
[02:57:37.500 --> 02:57:42.500]  Yeah. By the way, I mean, that's why the Washington Post wants to just call today and wants to talk to me.
[02:57:42.500 --> 02:57:48.500]  And it's like, even if the reporter's good, it's either going to be a hit piece or it'll never run.
[02:57:48.500 --> 02:57:51.500]  I mean, the Wall Street Journal said a big writer down here a few years ago.
[02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:52.500]  They said, oh, it's going to be a cover story.
[02:57:52.500 --> 02:57:53.500]  Oh, yes.
[02:57:53.500 --> 02:57:55.500]  And I said, oh, your editor told you that.
[02:57:55.500 --> 02:57:58.500]  I said, it will be killed by news core above that.
[02:57:58.500 --> 02:57:59.500]  Yeah.
[02:57:59.500 --> 02:58:01.500]  And she called me back a month later and said, my God, you're right.
[02:58:01.500 --> 02:58:05.500]  I've never had this happen working here, you know, a decade.
[02:58:05.500 --> 02:58:07.500]  Happens to me every week.
[02:58:07.500 --> 02:58:12.500]  When I did the CBS interview and it was over, I told a cameraman to produce the reporter.
[02:58:12.500 --> 02:58:14.500]  I said, this story will never air.
[02:58:14.500 --> 02:58:16.500]  You can't put Lloyd Chappell on national television.
[02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:17.500]  It'll never happen.
[02:58:17.500 --> 02:58:21.500]  And when I did the CBS interview, I guess that was about 10 days ago.
[02:58:21.500 --> 02:58:22.500]  I told them the same thing.
[02:58:22.500 --> 02:58:27.500]  But if you talk to Washington Post, ask them where their story is about the diversion of
[02:58:27.500 --> 02:58:32.500]  federal small business contracts, the corporate giants that were supposed to run about 10 days ago.
[02:58:32.500 --> 02:58:33.500]  All right.
[02:58:33.500 --> 02:58:34.500]  Listen, great job.
[02:58:34.500 --> 02:58:35.500]  We'll talk to you for a full interview soon.
[02:58:35.500 --> 02:58:39.500]  But understand, folks, they don't want you to know this information.
[02:58:39.500 --> 02:58:41.500]  Get info wars out to everybody.
[02:58:41.500 --> 02:58:43.500]  See you tonight, seven o'clock central.
[02:58:43.500 --> 02:58:45.500]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.500 --> 02:58:47.500]  Visit GCNLive.com.
[02:58:47.500 --> 02:58:51.500]  Overdrive coming up.
[02:58:51.500 --> 02:58:52.500]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.500 --> 02:58:57.500]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:58:57.500 --> 02:59:02.500]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:59:02.500 --> 02:59:03.500]  It's true.
[02:59:03.500 --> 02:59:08.500]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:59:08.500 --> 02:59:13.500]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:59:13.500 --> 02:59:20.500]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[02:59:20.500 --> 02:59:21.500]  And here's the best part.
[02:59:21.500 --> 02:59:28.500]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:59:28.500 --> 02:59:31.500]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:31.500 --> 02:59:38.500]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:59:38.500 --> 02:59:42.500]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:59:42.500 --> 02:59:47.500]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:47.500 --> 02:59:50.500]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:00:17.500 --> 03:00:26.500]  Well, Obama has come out and said that entrepreneurs are lazy scum, basically.
[03:00:26.500 --> 03:00:28.500]  You didn't build Jack Squat.
[03:00:28.500 --> 03:00:33.500]  So we've got a couple of these evil people sitting there while I talked to the last two guests.
[03:00:33.500 --> 03:00:38.500]  Briefly, you're talking to Ralph and then Marty and Ken, at least.
[03:00:38.500 --> 03:00:39.500]  Sorry to David and Jason.
[03:00:39.500 --> 03:00:41.500]  We'll probably won't have time to get to you, but we'll see what happens.
[03:00:41.500 --> 03:00:42.500]  Real fast, Ralph.
[03:00:42.500 --> 03:00:46.500]  How evil of an entrepreneur scum are you?
[03:00:46.500 --> 03:00:48.500]  How are you doing, Alex?
[03:00:48.500 --> 03:00:49.500]  Good.
[03:00:49.500 --> 03:00:51.500]  Man, it's great to talk to you.
[03:00:51.500 --> 03:00:54.500]  I've been listening for a while, first-time caller.
[03:00:54.500 --> 03:00:57.500]  I'm from Chicago.
[03:00:57.500 --> 03:01:00.500]  As you know, this is the mafia capital.
[03:01:00.500 --> 03:01:06.500]  Previously, my grandfather, when he started the company, were actually a payroll service.
[03:01:06.500 --> 03:01:11.500]  We do a lot of the payroll for a lot of the local businesses in the suburbs.
[03:01:11.500 --> 03:01:20.500]  And he would tell me back in the days that he would get shaked down a lot for not complying
[03:01:20.500 --> 03:01:23.500]  with whatever they needed or whatever they wanted.
[03:01:23.500 --> 03:01:28.500]  And nowadays, it's more of, so it's bureaucracy that we have to put up with.
[03:01:28.500 --> 03:01:37.500]  And I have to deal with Homeland Security almost every day for some employees now filing
[03:01:37.500 --> 03:01:43.500]  proper paperwork, and I've been threatened and shut down at fine countless weeks.
[03:01:43.500 --> 03:01:44.500]  Oh, yeah.
[03:01:44.500 --> 03:01:49.500]  Oh, listen, Texas isn't bad compared to other states, but Ted Anderson, half the time I
[03:01:49.500 --> 03:01:53.500]  called Ted Anderson up at Genesis, he's got state auditors.
[03:01:53.500 --> 03:01:55.500]  He said, oh, just everybody gets this.
[03:01:55.500 --> 03:01:59.500]  And they just come in and buy or inspectors for the building.
[03:01:59.500 --> 03:02:00.500]  I mean, talk about socialism.
[03:02:00.500 --> 03:02:03.500]  I mean, what a joke.
[03:02:03.500 --> 03:02:05.500]  It's a complete joke.
[03:02:05.500 --> 03:02:08.500]  I mean, I don't know what to do.
[03:02:08.500 --> 03:02:10.500]  I think about it every day.
[03:02:10.500 --> 03:02:12.500]  My wife thinks about it.
[03:02:12.500 --> 03:02:16.500]  And I don't know what to tell my children.
[03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:20.500]  I could be at risk any day for a shutdown.
[03:02:20.500 --> 03:02:22.500]  And this is my life with it.
[03:02:22.500 --> 03:02:26.500]  Well, yeah, that's all patriot act compliance, where you've got to spy on everybody and they
[03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:30.500]  lie to you and say that Homeland Security's in control of you.
[03:02:30.500 --> 03:02:34.500]  It's indentured servitude.
[03:02:34.500 --> 03:02:41.500]  I mean, I have, we have a lawyer, you know, a personal friend of mine who does work for
[03:02:41.500 --> 03:02:43.500]  us when I do need him.
[03:02:43.500 --> 03:02:47.500]  And he tells me that a lot of the things that he sees is very unconstitutional.
[03:02:47.500 --> 03:02:55.500]  A lot of the things that he sees is just them putting pressure just to get what they want.
[03:02:55.500 --> 03:02:56.500]  So what are they wanting?
[03:02:56.500 --> 03:02:59.500]  I mean, wanting you to spy on people or what is it?
[03:02:59.500 --> 03:03:04.500]  They come in with new forms every week.
[03:03:04.500 --> 03:03:07.500]  They want social security numbers.
[03:03:07.500 --> 03:03:09.500]  They want us to comply with.
[03:03:09.500 --> 03:03:17.500]  They want us to do what basically what, because there's so many people in Chicago that they
[03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:19.500]  don't know who's illegal and who's not.
[03:03:19.500 --> 03:03:23.500]  And they want to make sure that we're not employing or paying help.
[03:03:23.500 --> 03:03:25.500]  But meanwhile, they're hiring the illegals and bringing them in.
[03:03:25.500 --> 03:03:27.500]  It's just a way to harass businesses.
[03:03:27.500 --> 03:03:29.500]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:29.500 --> 03:03:30.500]  Horrible to hear that.
[03:03:30.500 --> 03:03:32.500]  Marty in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:03:32.500 --> 03:03:33.500]  Welcome.
[03:03:33.500 --> 03:03:34.500]  Yeah, Alex.
[03:03:34.500 --> 03:03:37.500]  I've been in construction for 40 years.
[03:03:37.500 --> 03:03:41.500]  And no warrants have I seen any government officials around.
[03:03:41.500 --> 03:03:43.500]  I mean, outside it gets 100 degrees.
[03:03:43.500 --> 03:03:48.500]  It gets that hot that, you know, you can't, they'd pass out.
[03:03:48.500 --> 03:03:54.500]  And I just feel like for him to say that.
[03:03:54.500 --> 03:03:55.500]  Now turn your radio off.
[03:03:55.500 --> 03:03:58.500]  I just want to, man, he makes me so mad.
[03:03:58.500 --> 03:04:03.500]  But you got to turn your radio off.
[03:04:03.500 --> 03:04:09.500]  Also, I've got a little issue here.
[03:04:09.500 --> 03:04:15.500]  There was a guy in Leesburg was killed at 1.30 in the morning.
[03:04:15.500 --> 03:04:18.500]  His door was kicked in by cops.
[03:04:18.500 --> 03:04:21.500]  And they saw that they came to the wrong house and he had a gun.
[03:04:21.500 --> 03:04:22.500]  So they shot him, right?
[03:04:22.500 --> 03:04:24.500]  They shot him dead, man.
[03:04:24.500 --> 03:04:28.500]  And he opened the door to find out who was there because they didn't
[03:04:28.500 --> 03:04:30.500]  identify themselves.
[03:04:30.500 --> 03:04:31.500]  And they shot him dead.
[03:04:31.500 --> 03:04:34.500]  Yeah, but I mean, government creates everything.
[03:04:34.500 --> 03:04:37.500]  I mean, they gave him a gift.
[03:04:37.500 --> 03:04:39.500]  I mean, and there's a guy standing there.
[03:04:39.500 --> 03:04:40.500]  No, no, no, no, no, sir.
[03:04:40.500 --> 03:04:42.500]  They gave him a gift.
[03:04:42.500 --> 03:04:45.500]  They came to the wrong house, banged on the door, opened it and shot him.
[03:04:45.500 --> 03:04:48.500]  I mean, that's a government.
[03:04:48.500 --> 03:04:52.500]  Look at what Hitler and Stalin and Mao and Fidel Castro and
[03:04:52.500 --> 03:04:58.500]  old potting, Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar and Vlad the Impaler.
[03:04:58.500 --> 03:05:23.500]  They gave that man a gift.
