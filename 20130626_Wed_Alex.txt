[00:46.160 --> 00:52.360]  your host Alex Jones we have a top professor joining us Roman Jan
[00:52.360 --> 01:00.080]  Polanski who was on with us about two years ago warning of a cybernetic
[01:00.080 --> 01:06.440]  takeover of society and he's going to be joining us for about 45 minutes in the
[01:06.440 --> 01:12.600]  second hour you've got coming out where all the major pharmacological pills will
[01:12.600 --> 01:17.520]  have tracker chips and them that report back to Skynet on you all of the
[01:17.520 --> 01:22.800]  appliances with wireless internet are watching you that's what the CIA director
[01:22.800 --> 01:29.520]  said I remember in the Batman before last the one with the Joker they use the
[01:29.520 --> 01:37.600]  sonar they use the wireless internet on the cell phones to create a system that
[01:37.600 --> 01:43.400]  scans and maps the entire city but that also listens to everybody that's real
[01:43.400 --> 01:51.280]  technology for decades they've been using wireless internet and wireless
[01:51.280 --> 01:56.680]  telecommunications to scan they've got receiver chips we've had engineers on
[01:56.680 --> 02:02.280]  about this where it doesn't just go out and transmit data and then receive data
[02:02.280 --> 02:08.680]  in the transmitter and receiver they can have another system that when it
[02:08.680 --> 02:16.200]  transmits out it bounces back just like you use radar to make out the shape of
[02:16.200 --> 02:19.440]  an aircraft and it can look right through your walls that's what I keep
[02:19.440 --> 02:23.560]  trying to explain to people here and this is all being announced by the way

[09:16.840 --> 09:21.480]  further here I want to open the phones up to take your calls again first-time

[09:30.240 --> 09:33.880]  talk about any issue that you'd like to discuss I do want to take a lot of calls
[09:33.880 --> 09:36.280]  in the first hour and I never seem to get around to this I take them the last
[09:36.280 --> 09:40.600]  15 minutes or so we're gonna open the phones up starting at the next segment
[09:40.600 --> 09:48.200]  and the number to join us is 800-259-9231 I love the wild card grab bag of the
[09:48.200 --> 09:51.440]  callers every time I listen to a rebroadcast it's the calls that I find
[09:51.440 --> 09:56.000]  most interesting now we don't screen them so sometimes we get prank calls and
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.800]  sometimes we get people that are drunk but that's that's interesting as well I
[10:00.800 --> 10:04.600]  like to not have that filter the only time we screen the calls is if I say
[10:04.600 --> 10:10.400]  specifically I want to get police officers on about their view of
[10:10.400 --> 10:14.400]  something or if I want to get doctors on about Obamacare or if I want to let
[10:14.400 --> 10:18.200]  nurses call in and talk about how they're euthanizing people all over the
[10:18.200 --> 10:22.080]  U.S. and you hear the nurses call in saying oh yeah we're euthanizing a
[10:22.080 --> 10:25.120]  lady on the third floor right now she's begging for food and water she's 10
[10:25.120 --> 10:28.680]  days in and you'll hear in the background Dr. Walker Dr. Walker I mean
[10:28.680 --> 10:33.640]  they're there things like that but it's just a wide open free for all whatever
[10:33.640 --> 10:37.080]  your question whatever your comment you if you disagree with me if you agree with
[10:37.080 --> 10:48.040]  me 800 259 92 31 800 25 9 9 231 we have a lot of good news out there 97% opposed
[10:48.040 --> 10:54.560]  to TSA naked body scanners TSA completes enforced public comment period on
[10:54.560 --> 11:02.440]  rollout of invasive technology and 97% on the public notice rulemaking federal
[11:02.440 --> 11:09.680]  site people have to give their info and everything 97% are against it I mean I
[11:09.680 --> 11:15.720]  talked to people and over 80% that I talked to say Snowden's a hero and then
[11:15.720 --> 11:21.200]  you see polls saying you know half of Americans think Snowden is a trader you
[11:21.200 --> 11:26.720]  see another poll saying 79% say he's a hero and then you learn who these polling
[11:26.720 --> 11:31.880]  groups are the more accurate ones you see disinfo pieces out there about them
[11:31.880 --> 11:35.680]  saying they're not accurate and they'll use a few cases where they where their
[11:35.680 --> 11:40.040]  poll doesn't you know come true in an election like Zogby I found Zogby is
[11:40.040 --> 11:44.880]  is more accurate gallops a little more accurate even though it can be spun
[11:44.880 --> 11:48.560]  sometimes if you have public policy polling that's run by the Democrats
[11:48.560 --> 11:54.920]  basically I mean what a joke what a joke we called up to pay to have them to do
[11:54.920 --> 11:58.960]  a poll just to see if we can get them to do it and they told us they said we do
[11:58.960 --> 12:05.680]  not like your politics we're not gonna let you pay us $5,000 to do a poll this
[12:05.680 --> 12:10.920]  is just amazing so my point is is that when you see an article out there like
[12:10.920 --> 12:17.200]  on info wars.com yesterday saying a majority of Americans support drones
[12:17.200 --> 12:22.320]  domestically and Paul Watson reports on the poll I've called Paul up who I
[12:22.320 --> 12:25.680]  think is great but I'm just having a public discussion about this open air
[12:25.680 --> 12:33.240]  and I said you know Paul I don't really believe that I think was 69% and one
[12:33.240 --> 12:38.000]  part of the poll agreed for anti-terrorism for drone and 67% oh there
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.160]  he's pulled it up yeah it's 67% I'm going for memory there it is of them
[12:42.160 --> 12:46.920]  support the use of unmanned spy drones for homeland security missions and 63%
[12:46.920 --> 12:52.400]  support their use for fighting crime but as Rand Paul has said it's pre-crime
[12:52.400 --> 12:56.680]  they're flying around surveilling you plus the balance of power is way out of
[12:56.680 --> 13:04.200]  whack when the government's this big but the issue that I'm basically trying to
[13:04.200 --> 13:10.120]  get at here is that you can't believe all these polls what you can believe is
[13:10.120 --> 13:15.360]  hundreds of thousands of people signing a petition to deport Pierce Morgan that
[13:15.360 --> 13:20.080]  shows people don't like him and his red coat you're surping anti-gun activities
[13:20.080 --> 13:23.040]  what you can believe is hundreds of thousands on the White House website
[13:23.040 --> 13:30.800]  saying we want you to pardon Edward Snowden Obama or hundreds of thousands
[13:30.800 --> 13:34.280]  on the White House website it's growing towards that saying they want an
[13:34.280 --> 13:39.840]  investigation of the death of Michael Hastings the reporter that said he had
[13:39.840 --> 13:44.760]  the biggest story of his life and then hours later his car blew up that's just
[13:44.760 --> 13:51.120]  some of the issues but but there's the article on infowars.com 97% opposed the
[13:51.120 --> 13:57.840]  TSA body scanners in the public comment period so that is more reflective of
[13:57.840 --> 14:04.400]  what I've seen I've talked to airports and most of them I'd say 80 90% are
[14:04.400 --> 14:07.800]  against the naked body scanners and know it's all security theater and dog
[14:07.800 --> 14:13.920]  training and slave training I have a friend who works at a high level at the
[14:13.920 --> 14:18.440]  Austin Bergstrom Airport I won't say his name he asked me not to and he told me
[14:18.440 --> 14:22.720]  I don't know five six years ago about how I was with him and he said here let's
[14:22.720 --> 14:28.640]  turn on the television let's watch a news aid Austin the local Time Warner 24
[14:28.640 --> 14:32.920]  hour news channel and he said let's let's see what they do by the way news
[14:32.920 --> 14:36.120]  aids better in some cases than than other mainstream media they actually have
[14:36.120 --> 14:38.080]  some good people over there I'm not throwing them under the bus of their
[14:38.080 --> 14:42.680]  listening but this happened and he said they had they talked to 40 plus people
[14:42.680 --> 14:48.000]  trying to get them to support the pat downs and all the stuff that was going
[14:48.000 --> 14:54.040]  in then and they found one old lady who said she thought it was great after 40
[14:54.040 --> 15:00.240]  people because in his job he had to be there watching this and he was so he
[15:00.240 --> 15:06.560]  turned it on we're watching it and you know where they're drinking beer this
[15:06.560 --> 15:11.760]  was entertainment and it comes on and he goes watch it's gonna be her and he
[15:11.760 --> 15:16.160]  had the old lady it was the one person that was for it and he was rolling
[15:16.160 --> 15:21.000]  around you know with sick laughter is very painful actually to see the
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.920]  distortion that goes on so you've got to be in the media or around the media to
[15:25.920 --> 15:29.640]  learn how these things work but that's a great example of that so there I've gone
[15:29.640 --> 15:34.680]  over I've gone over that issue as just an example something I'm gonna want to
[15:34.680 --> 15:38.960]  air for days because I came back across it this weekend was the so-called
[15:38.960 --> 15:42.880]  Kuwaiti girl that it turned out was really the daughter of the ambassador of
[15:42.880 --> 15:49.840]  the Kuwaiti ambassador and she famously got up and said they threw the babies
[15:49.840 --> 15:54.240]  out on the floor you know they stomped their brains out all this kind of stuff
[15:54.240 --> 15:58.960]  and they said for her security we're not going to say her name we're going to use
[15:58.960 --> 16:06.520]  a alias and you can tell the whole body language of the committee hearing it
[16:06.520 --> 16:13.920]  was totally fake and it indeed came out that it was a fake testimony and nobody
[16:13.920 --> 16:19.400]  threw babies out of incubators and there were major journalistic investigations
[16:19.400 --> 16:23.640]  and I've got those articles dealing with it but when you watch it then you
[16:23.640 --> 16:29.240]  realize that they had fake newscast from Atlanta saying they were in Kuwait and
[16:29.240 --> 16:35.520]  Israel with blue screens behind them and palm trees saying they were on the roof
[16:35.520 --> 16:41.120]  as chemical weapons scud missiles were coming in but back then that the public
[16:41.120 --> 16:45.520]  was so mindless and so trusting that they would even send this over an
[16:45.520 --> 16:51.160]  unscramble satellite feed where people that had 10-foot type dishes and bigger
[16:51.160 --> 16:55.640]  could pick it up and people recorded it as they would go okay get ready to act
[16:55.640 --> 16:59.920]  alright and they'd make dirty jokes and stuff and then put their helmets on and
[16:59.920 --> 17:03.960]  then you know take takes this wasn't live they'd crack up laughing and they'd go
[17:03.960 --> 17:10.920]  do it again do it again oh we're here in Tel Aviv or we're here in Kuwait in
[17:10.920 --> 17:17.040]  different days same reporters same set and I remember watching that in 1990 1991
[17:17.040 --> 17:24.080]  fake newscast folks if you think it's bad then it's much worse now and that's my
[17:24.080 --> 17:30.440]  point is that we're not living in Kansas anymore but what's happening is
[17:30.440 --> 17:34.360]  there's two different worlds happening you've got old media that's that's
[17:34.360 --> 17:39.920]  real like talk radio to some extent you've got some print publications that
[17:39.920 --> 17:48.560]  want readers so sometimes they tell the truth like Rolling Stone you've got new
[17:48.560 --> 17:52.680]  media all over the place and together we're really bigger than the
[17:52.680 --> 17:57.960]  establishment dinosaur media and so the globalists are operating in a vacuum
[17:57.960 --> 18:01.480]  they're up there acting like everybody's buying another propaganda acting like
[18:01.480 --> 18:05.160]  they still have all the viewers all they have is the biggest sets that cost
[18:05.160 --> 18:10.080]  hundreds of millions of dollars a year to run TV's very expensive and they're
[18:10.080 --> 18:14.480]  and they're losing money all of them even news core that has more viewers and
[18:14.480 --> 18:18.160]  all the other cable news together is been losing money on record it's news
[18:18.160 --> 18:23.560]  division because it's a propaganda division general electric and Microsoft
[18:23.560 --> 18:28.440]  that have been you know connected to NBC and MSNBC for a long time it NBC for
[18:28.440 --> 18:34.000]  50 years to General Electric they're going to make money off their weapons
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.760]  division where they've got you know five million dollar cruise missiles and
[18:37.760 --> 18:42.880]  million dollar cluster bombs and bunker busters that are being dropped on people
[18:42.880 --> 18:47.960]  so what if their news division loses 50 a hundred million dollars a year 200
[18:47.960 --> 18:51.500]  million dollars a year sometimes it doesn't matter that's the cost of
[18:51.500 --> 18:56.040]  brainwashing people but you see they don't even have the audience anymore but
[18:56.040 --> 19:02.240]  all they've got is the illusion of the prestige of being on these stupid shows
[19:02.240 --> 19:06.280]  and yes if you're on one of these shows and then you do something interesting
[19:06.280 --> 19:10.960]  then it will be put on all of the mainstream shows and then you've got a
[19:10.960 --> 19:17.000]  big audience because then you're on Jay Leno then you're on you know the other
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.360]  shows that do have large audiences compared to news and then it gets a ton
[19:22.360 --> 19:26.680]  of attention so I just want to continue to announce to everybody that the
[19:26.680 --> 19:33.080]  establishment is flailing around and so they're trying a tyrannical takeover
[19:33.080 --> 19:38.200]  but it's not in a vacuum there's resistance to it it's like they're
[19:38.200 --> 19:41.840]  coming in for a landing like there's no resistance and we're waiting for them
[19:41.840 --> 19:45.640]  now I'm gonna go to your calls because I promise to do it and then the big news

[24:43.320 --> 24:50.280]  colleagues were too scared to release panicked email and then everybody's
[24:50.280 --> 24:54.320]  supposed to just line up and go along with this I want to talk directly to
[24:54.320 --> 24:58.200]  his friend the sergeant that had the courage to go public sergeant Biggs
[24:58.200 --> 25:04.840]  Joe Biggs he said everybody's scared but I'm not scared he said Hastings he
[25:04.840 --> 25:11.520]  said Mike would stand up for me if this happened and Fox News is Megan Kelly made
[25:11.520 --> 25:16.000]  jokes about tinfoil hats it's just despicable ladies and gentlemen that
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.480]  we've got a war on the press in this country he says oh they're coming after

[25:26.800 --> 25:31.720]  blows up and then we're immediately not supposed to ask if he was killed right

[25:34.880 --> 25:38.280]  some clips of that and getting into some other world news obviously but right
[25:38.280 --> 25:43.280]  now let's go to Will in Georgia will you're on the air welcome thank you
[25:43.280 --> 25:48.440]  Alex thank God for you and for info wars it's a powerful mystery and it's an
[25:48.440 --> 25:51.920]  opportunity to take our country back to restore our creed of civil religion our
[25:51.920 --> 25:56.040]  ancestors received America and covenant from the creator of the universe and
[25:56.040 --> 26:00.960]  nobody in between this is the promised land that Isaiah prophesied and the
[26:00.960 --> 26:04.400]  forces that are marshaled against us are those that Thomas Jefferson whose
[26:04.400 --> 26:09.840]  writings and life prove him to be a prophet of God is Zion we are the new
[26:09.840 --> 26:13.800]  Israel anybody can read Isaiah it's quite clear that England's chief rabbi
[26:13.800 --> 26:18.680]  Johnson sacks agrees all the sides of stipulations are met in America and
[26:18.680 --> 26:24.760]  Michael Hastings within five minutes passing the red light at whatever that
[26:24.760 --> 26:29.520]  everybody can go look it up about red light camera Hastings they can see the
[26:29.520 --> 26:35.040]  picture that the paparazzi took in about four minutes I think in 34 seconds
[26:35.040 --> 26:40.480]  from passing that light several blocks away his car was blown up and the fellow
[26:40.480 --> 26:44.400]  with his each each and the keep on was out there with a with a garden hose
[26:44.400 --> 26:49.880]  already sprung from his street imagine how long it would take so it was some
[26:49.880 --> 26:54.040]  minutes before the car blew up after it went through the intersection and by the
[26:54.040 --> 26:58.160]  time the light gets down there by time the camera gets down to the bombing the
[26:58.160 --> 27:03.120]  gentleman with the seats each and the and the keep on already has with yard
[27:03.120 --> 27:08.560]  hose in front of his house strung out watering a car fire he had a beard white
[27:08.560 --> 27:11.920]  hair we know how old he was everybody knows you don't put water on a car fire
[27:11.920 --> 27:16.080]  if you want to put it out you do that in order to exacerbate it and that's why
[27:16.080 --> 27:20.960]  the fire flames were going higher and higher as he put the water on it so you
[27:20.960 --> 27:23.440]  just think of the timing under five minutes you'd already strung the water
[27:23.440 --> 27:29.080]  hose out from his house had it turn had gone back to the spigot turned it on was
[27:29.080 --> 27:35.640]  putting water on car fire and it was a bombing we know it was Boston brakes we
[27:35.640 --> 27:39.560]  know he was going maybe 45 miles an hour through the intersection evidently the
[27:39.560 --> 27:43.800]  people behind and running him on remote control didn't have the wherewithal or
[27:43.800 --> 27:46.600]  at that time in the morning didn't figure they needed to stop at the light so
[27:46.600 --> 27:52.120]  they just ran the light that completely an assassination that's crucifixion 2.0
[27:52.120 --> 27:56.200]  the same people hammered the impale mistakes into tens of thousands of
[27:56.200 --> 28:00.040]  Christ's for twice denying Caesar was God Almighty you can read Thomas Jefferson's
[28:00.040 --> 28:03.240]  letter to his nephew I hear you I hear you look all I know is there should be an
[28:03.240 --> 28:06.520]  investigation of this and you can't trust the police to do it I mean the
[28:06.520 --> 28:13.720]  coroner of Breitbart that did the autopsy died of poisoning and they're like oh
[28:13.720 --> 28:17.920]  well maybe that's normal it's just amazing what's going on I appreciate you

[33:49.240 --> 33:59.560]  today we were just talking to a gentleman in Alabama about what specifically
[33:59.560 --> 34:05.160]  happened to his mother and what happened when he was dealing with Mercedes in
[34:05.160 --> 34:09.240]  this I think he said 1999 he said there was an on-star wasn't supposedly a
[34:09.240 --> 34:14.160]  cell phone that they use in these wireless navigation systems that we know
[34:14.160 --> 34:17.320]  on record are being used to track everything you do and now remote

[34:27.360 --> 34:31.240]  people before Rachel Maddow comes out and says that I'm lying and saying that
[34:31.240 --> 34:35.320]  they can remote control cars that's a fact but she knows her audience is so
[34:35.320 --> 34:39.040]  stupid she'll probably I'm just giving her a good example of kind of how she
[34:39.040 --> 34:43.320]  likes to lie probably a good life or she can say that I said you know what
[34:43.320 --> 34:47.360]  giant wasp underneath the Capitol building I never said that but she said I
[34:47.360 --> 34:51.720]  said that this is the type of deception they engage in but specifically sir
[34:51.720 --> 34:58.400]  getting back to you go ahead and tell us specifically what you were about to
[34:58.400 --> 35:05.720]  finish up with okay Alex I said the Mercedes Benz was a brand new SLK 1999
[35:05.720 --> 35:10.200]  model and my mother was killed in a head-on collision at a very very low
[35:10.200 --> 35:17.920]  Delta V change in velocity but the kicker here is that the airbag didn't
[35:17.920 --> 35:26.360]  deploy fully a kind of clover leaf so within 15 hours of that automobile
[35:26.360 --> 35:32.920]  accident there were engineers from Stuttgart Germany on the ground covertly
[35:32.920 --> 35:40.440]  that got into where the car was being stored and downloaded from the car's
[35:40.440 --> 35:47.960]  computer every bit of data from that car now that was in 1999 so somehow that
[35:47.960 --> 35:53.840]  car had a mechanism mechanism in it that communicated to Stuttgart Germany that
[35:53.840 --> 36:02.320]  the airbag module had fired and so just think of the progress that's been made
[36:02.320 --> 36:07.760]  since that time to now like I said there was no on-star there was no visible way
[36:07.760 --> 36:13.000]  of communicating that that we the consumer knew of it was in that vehicle
[36:13.000 --> 36:19.160]  but there were engineers on the ground that bribed the storage place to get
[36:19.160 --> 36:25.040]  into and plugged up you know some type of a mechanism to the car to extract the
[36:25.040 --> 36:31.320]  data that's how defensive they are and get this in the in the trial it was a
[36:31.320 --> 36:37.920]  14-day jury trial the father of the airbag flew in on a Gulf Stream 5 from
[36:37.920 --> 36:43.040]  Germany he invented the airbag and guess who he was working for when he
[36:43.040 --> 36:48.600]  invented it he was working for Mercedes Benz his name is Dr. Luis
[36:48.600 --> 36:53.400]  Bermbella and he said he had never seen an airbag module do that in all of his
[36:53.400 --> 36:59.720]  life and is where he's a consultant now for them but we also subpoenaed there's
[36:59.720 --> 37:04.160]  a company can I say the name of it Alex yeah yeah go ahead sir I believe it's
[37:04.160 --> 37:10.520]  Bosch and they this Bosch company has the algorithm for the ignition switch
[37:10.520 --> 37:15.480]  for the airbag and they they were subpoenaed to give us that algorithm and
[37:15.480 --> 37:20.920]  they denied it they would not give the algorithm so you know that's my point
[37:20.920 --> 37:26.440]  there as far as that goes on Mercedes had about 15 strings of lawyers and 25
[37:26.440 --> 37:31.280]  paralegals a whole building rented you know I keep hearing a lot of the
[37:31.280 --> 37:35.200]  audience say was let Mercedes step up let there step up I don't believe you'll
[37:35.200 --> 37:39.480]  see them step up they're part of the military industrial complex sure well
[37:39.480 --> 37:41.880]  what you did I appreciate your call sir and sorry about what happened to your
[37:41.880 --> 37:53.160]  mother look the larger issue here as we always lose the forest for the trees or
[37:53.160 --> 37:58.760]  the trees for the forest everything is having remote control kill switches put
[37:58.760 --> 38:04.840]  in it everything is having surveillance systems put in it and you pay for the
[38:04.840 --> 38:10.200]  extra cost of all the electronics goods due to this global standardization and
[38:10.200 --> 38:14.400]  I don't care if you're in Germany or Australia or Russia or China or Canada
[38:14.400 --> 38:21.480]  or Mexico or Chile or Venezuela for that matter everything manufactured by
[38:21.480 --> 38:26.520]  these fortune 100 companies is globally agreed upon even outside of law to have
[38:26.520 --> 38:30.360]  these tracker systems like those those articles earlier this year about the
[38:30.360 --> 38:43.040]  communist Chinese can track and monitor and cut off electronics in the US and
[38:43.040 --> 38:48.120]  including a lot of electronic chips and components in weapons systems well of
[38:48.120 --> 38:53.600]  course that's because all of this stuff has to have back doors so the NSA which
[38:53.600 --> 39:00.120]  isn't for the US government we pay for it but it's run by foreign banks over a
[39:00.120 --> 39:04.960]  hundred major companies private contractors are the ones that get the
[39:04.960 --> 39:10.560]  contracts to run all this and to do the analyst work and do the spying private
[39:10.560 --> 39:14.440]  corporations have come and lobbied to build a giant government and then have
[39:14.440 --> 39:21.840]  the keys given to them and then they're paid to rape us financially and
[39:21.840 --> 39:29.080]  intellectually and our privacy and so they so overshot us in the over the
[39:29.080 --> 39:36.560]  topness of the tyranny that I get up here 15 years ago seven years ago a year
[39:36.560 --> 39:41.080]  ago and say all the new video game consoles that are high-end all the new
[39:41.080 --> 39:46.480]  cars that are high-end all the new houses that are high-end our total
[39:46.480 --> 39:51.880]  surveillance I mean I saw a billion-dollar contracts in for regions that we
[39:51.880 --> 39:57.040]  covered two years ago no one else covered it but info wars calm and and
[39:57.040 --> 40:01.880]  drudge picked it up drudge report calm no one else covered it the companies
[40:01.880 --> 40:06.440]  bragging they'd gotten contracts to put microphones and hidden cameras in
[40:06.440 --> 40:11.800]  street lights and fake power transformers and other systems with shotgun
[40:11.800 --> 40:22.080]  mics to listen to everybody and by the way even before that came out it was in
[40:22.080 --> 40:28.080]  the news in 1999 in the austin american statesman and I have shots of it in the
[40:28.080 --> 40:34.440]  statesman saying oh we got a federal grant for gunshot detectors
[40:34.440 --> 40:40.560]  $800,000 a year over the next decade K. Belly Hutchinson the senator bragged
[40:40.560 --> 40:45.000]  that she got gunshot detectors for Austin you notice you've never heard one
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.720]  person arrested from a gunshot detector you notice you've never heard about it
[40:48.720 --> 40:52.200]  they've been put in nationwide now Austin was one of the pilot cities in the
[40:52.200 --> 40:57.600]  late 90s I looked at the company name and went and search engine did and was on
[40:57.600 --> 41:02.360]  their site where they were playing promo audio they had promo audio bragging
[41:02.360 --> 41:06.440]  that they were really shotgun mics and said here you hear people talking on the
[41:06.440 --> 41:11.560]  park bench from 200 yards away and it's a real recording with birds tweeting and
[41:11.560 --> 41:17.200]  people talking and of course it was phrased like they were criminals just
[41:17.200 --> 41:22.040]  like the new homeland security training videos in all of them the drones are
[41:22.040 --> 41:27.600]  watching gun owners shoot guns on their ranch or shell guns to each other and
[41:27.600 --> 41:31.720]  it's always white guys with John Deere hats
[41:32.960 --> 41:38.520]  that's what this is for it's always been of course there's drones now the
[41:38.520 --> 41:42.880]  government admits it domestically of course there's Google blimps I told you
[41:42.880 --> 41:47.360]  a decade ago Google was going to roll out with blimps really NSA blimps and top
[41:47.360 --> 41:51.360]  can call it internet service when it's really surveillance platforms looking
[41:51.360 --> 41:58.040]  through your walls with ground penetrating radar black and white
[41:58.040 --> 42:02.240]  images that's 30 year old technology that was declassified they've got
[42:02.240 --> 42:08.040]  wireless internet basically what it is beams where it's color folks and by
[42:08.040 --> 42:12.400]  color they can see every freckle on your body every goosebump it's it's it's
[42:12.400 --> 42:18.480]  better vision than human vision and they just fly over your house scanning
[42:18.480 --> 42:24.520]  everything you're doing and it's all on record is the issue do you understand
[42:24.520 --> 42:32.000]  this and you paid for it they get rich Google is the biggest corporation in the
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.640]  world you can debate whether it's Google Apple or Exxon mobile the point is
[42:36.640 --> 42:42.640]  there the triumphant the trifecta up there and they all sit up there squatting
[42:42.640 --> 42:49.160]  on top of us and it's all a giant joke to them but the top Google guys ones worth
[42:49.160 --> 42:53.320]  20 billion ones worth 40 billion ones worth 30 billion ones worth 10 billion
[42:53.320 --> 42:58.600]  eight billion they're all just up there sucking your money sucking everything
[42:58.600 --> 43:02.880]  laughing at you but it's okay because Vince Vaughn has a movie coming out where
[43:02.880 --> 43:07.640]  Google is really sweet and funny and nerdly and you know they're your future
[43:07.640 --> 43:16.600]  haha this is all the big sick joke for these people I'm gonna go back to your
[43:16.600 --> 43:22.840]  calls first I want to tell you the new magazine is in it's the new July issue

[47:52.680 --> 47:56.120]  already talked to the Mercedes guy let's talk to Dan in Oregon Dan you're on the
[47:56.120 --> 48:00.640]  air thanks for holding. Hey how you doing God bless you and all you do a lot of
[48:00.640 --> 48:05.480]  fans out here in Oregon years. Thank you sir. Hey yeah when you said there's a
[48:05.480 --> 48:09.440]  lot of resistance of course we're not all gonna lay down and run under our bed
[48:09.440 --> 48:13.840]  and let these people stomp us and take our properties and destroy things you
[48:13.840 --> 48:17.320]  know who knows what's gonna happen if the banks ever collapse everything I
[48:17.320 --> 48:21.040]  don't know how much control we'd have over that. Oh they're incrementally
[48:21.040 --> 48:25.040]  collapsing things and they're putting in soft martial law to prepare us that's
[48:25.040 --> 48:29.240]  what all of this is about they put chemical weapons in the water on record
[48:29.240 --> 48:33.960]  we are under a foreign banking attack it controls the bureaucracy and the health
[48:33.960 --> 48:38.080]  departments. The health departments are really the military arm to carry out the
[48:38.080 --> 48:42.320]  CPS grabbing the forced drugging the poisoning of the water they were
[48:42.320 --> 48:48.960]  set up by the eugenicist in 1910 in New York. Wow yeah you know what even in
[48:48.960 --> 48:52.840]  Oregon like you say with the health people are having so many breathing
[48:52.840 --> 48:56.920]  problems here because they're really spraying heavy in the skies anymore. Of
[48:56.920 --> 49:01.160]  course they are. And I can't believe that people don't look up and notice what's
[49:01.160 --> 49:04.600]  wrong with the sky you know they don't notice things but it's like it's
[49:04.600 --> 49:08.840]  everything going on people are more worried about things I don't even feel
[49:08.840 --> 49:12.920]  people could watch MSNBC and think they're getting news I watched it yesterday
[49:12.920 --> 49:16.040]  to see what they were gonna talk about with what the Supreme Court did with the
[49:16.040 --> 49:20.520]  voter ID thing you're saying of course it's all racist you know everything's
[49:20.520 --> 49:25.040]  racist anymore it's so disgusting it's not 1850 and they treated like oh use
[49:25.040 --> 49:28.920]  flames that's all in the past. Well what's happening is they've already got
[49:28.920 --> 49:36.560]  electronic voting fraud in in most areas so the real issue here is is that
[49:36.560 --> 49:41.560]  there is gerrymandering by whoever's already in power going on and the
[49:41.560 --> 49:45.800]  Democrats and Republicans told the Supreme Court to do this because they
[49:45.800 --> 49:50.720]  want to be able to keep their little mafia fiefdoms set up so that's what
[49:50.720 --> 49:52.880]  this is really all about because the only thing they can get around the
[49:52.880 --> 49:58.120]  electronic voting fraud is the gerrymandering so you may own the fraud
[49:58.120 --> 50:04.120]  company that's controlling how people vote but as it matter the Democrats or
[50:04.120 --> 50:10.520]  Republicans whoever's in power they'll control the gerrymandering where where
[50:10.520 --> 50:13.600]  again they can't have election fraud if it's too obvious that you're a
[50:13.600 --> 50:16.480]  Democratic district or a Republican district but it's going to the other
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.680]  group so it's all just a bunch of mafias the only thing holding them back is the
[50:20.680 --> 50:23.680]  separation of powers that's what the globalist want to centralization and
[50:23.680 --> 50:28.840]  always demonize gridlock because if they ever get a total centralization then
[50:28.840 --> 50:32.320]  there won't be all the end fighting by the criminal groups that actually holds
[50:32.320 --> 50:36.520]  them back the only thing the reason the Nazis were so bad is that they got a
[50:36.520 --> 50:41.520]  bureaucracy together that was in total control and it took the Soviets really
[50:41.520 --> 50:45.040]  20 years to really get fully taken over before they could really start killing
[50:45.040 --> 50:51.320]  everybody in mass the that's why David Rockefeller really worshipped Mao because
[50:51.320 --> 50:55.080]  he immediately was able to kill tens of millions and they like that they like to
[50:55.080 --> 50:58.480]  go directly to mass murder but then to get you ready for that first
[50:58.480 --> 51:00.920]  the right back
[51:00.920 --> 51:05.440]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives nature
[51:05.440 --> 51:10.320]  regularly sends us destructive storms 24 hours before a storm strikes people
[51:10.320 --> 51:15.080]  panic it would be wise to prepare a head of the panic curve the food price
[51:15.080 --> 51:19.360]  storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous
[51:19.360 --> 51:22.960]  heights by the end of the summer wonder if there'll really be a problem he

[54:19.440 --> 54:24.480]  this sergeant Joe Biggs one of the people he a blind copy the email that was
[54:24.480 --> 54:27.800]  panicked and the fact that the family basically says they think he was killed
[54:27.800 --> 54:33.400]  and the wife has said quote bother this is not getting media attention this is
[54:33.400 --> 54:40.040]  hiding in plain view this has been out since yesterday that she said quote she's
[54:40.040 --> 54:43.800]  going to take down whoever did this well you better come out and say you think
[54:43.800 --> 54:47.840]  it was foul play clearly or you might fall down and hit your head or your car
[54:47.840 --> 54:51.920]  will blow up and they say that a tree and again this is how the law of the
[54:51.920 --> 54:55.880]  jungle works once you're in a tyranny people just start rolling over in fear
[54:55.880 --> 55:01.200]  and once that happens the tyrants win and then the worst of the worst becomes
[55:01.200 --> 55:06.520]  the norm this is how freedom dies folks is when everybody just gets scared
[55:06.520 --> 55:10.560]  everybody complies everybody just says oh no you know Aaron Swartz must have
[55:10.560 --> 55:16.280]  hung himself even though he said he was gonna fight the feds and even though he
[55:16.280 --> 55:20.800]  was worth you know tens of millions of dollars and just gotten engaged and said
[55:20.800 --> 55:25.240]  he was gonna fight the fake federal charges I mean now the FBI just comes
[55:25.240 --> 55:28.560]  your house shoots you in the top of the head and then they go up we shot him in
[55:28.560 --> 55:31.160]  the head he didn't have any weapons didn't attack us he's dead they're like
[55:31.160 --> 55:35.520]  oh it's no big deal cops all the time you see it in the news you know guy gets
[55:35.520 --> 55:38.440]  out of his car they tell him get out of his car guy gets out nothing in his
[55:38.440 --> 55:41.800]  hands shoot him dead they go well we felt threatened maybe they can just put
[55:41.800 --> 55:45.720]  us in sand pits and shoot us like the Nazis and say I feel threatened boom boom
[55:45.720 --> 55:51.160]  boom I mean we're about one step away from that
[55:55.080 --> 55:58.920]  speaking of tyranny look at this article up on info wars comm of the
[55:58.920 --> 56:05.240]  daily caller gag order sought for eight eighth grader arrested for NRA shirt that
[56:05.240 --> 56:13.760]  simply said protect your rights and had the NRA symbol on it and it goes on to
[56:13.760 --> 56:21.040]  say that CBS affiliate W. O. W. K. TV is in court seeking a gag order to keep him
[56:21.040 --> 56:28.520]  from talking about the case and to keep his father from speaking out and saying
[56:28.520 --> 56:31.960]  he's be having his first moment persecuted yeah oh hey they're pointing out
[56:31.960 --> 56:34.880]  the word a bunch of tyrants that we told him take a shirt off and he said
[56:34.880 --> 56:38.480]  doesn't violate school policy we're allowed to wear shirts just says protect
[56:38.480 --> 56:44.760]  your rights so they arrested him I've got an article where a gentleman is
[56:44.760 --> 56:54.040]  facing 13 years in prison in LA for drawing with wall water soluble chalk
[56:54.040 --> 57:00.320]  children's chalk about people's rights on the street oh yeah they arrest people
[57:00.320 --> 57:05.320]  in awesome for that now they will throw the book at you where I live because
[57:05.320 --> 57:11.120]  again the same thing's happening out in LA we're going into a big fat tyranny
[57:11.120 --> 57:16.280]  folks you understand that California man faces 13 years in jail for scribbling
[57:16.280 --> 57:26.320]  anti-bank messages in chalk you criticize you criticize the new world
[57:26.320 --> 57:29.240]  order we're gonna arrest you and look right there in the article at a RT it

[57:33.760 --> 57:37.360]  trial oh yeah all over the country state and federal courts they say you don't
[57:37.360 --> 57:41.160]  bring I've read the transcripts it's in the news all the time there it is you
[57:41.160 --> 57:45.560]  don't bring up the Constitution here that the judge is sworn enough to these
[57:45.560 --> 57:51.600]  people are flaming tyrants flaming and they are scared of your first amendment
[57:51.600 --> 57:55.360]  because they know they've done wrong folks that's why they're persecuting the
[57:55.360 --> 57:59.120]  press it's why they're telling pro-life groups you can't be pro-life anymore
[57:59.120 --> 58:04.480]  we're gonna arrest you your speech isn't allowed I mean that's in the news and
[58:04.480 --> 58:09.000]  the press won't even stand up for Hastings because they're not a press
[58:09.000 --> 58:13.720]  they're a globalist regurgitation machine the new world order violence lies

[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.400]  alex jones
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:36.320]  all right I'm gonna get into Hastings wife saying quote she vows to take down
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.480]  whoever did this you know his car blew up we're gonna be getting to that in the
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.440]  next segment and we've got a special guest joining us on the technocratic
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.560]  takeover top professor but right now let's go back to your calls William in
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:53.400]  Utah William what's on your mind today hey Alex well I know a lot of people are
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.760]  scared especially with this Michael Hastings thing coming out it's pretty
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.560]  apparent everyone knows that it's that it's really you know people are scared
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.880]  that they're killing a lot of reporters they're killing a lot of soldiers they're
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.640]  killing a lot they're killing good guys all over the place yet they're gonna keep
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.440]  going and anyway there's two things that I found in my personal life that's
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:19.240]  brought me peace and help me get through with these times the first thing is you
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:23.160]  know daily prayer talking with our our father in heaven the father of our
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:28.560]  spirits and the second thing is daily scripture study I use my iPad every
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:34.200]  morning to read the King James Bible and I also read the Book of Mormon I don't
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.520]  know if you've ever have you ever read the Book of Mormon no I haven't the most
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:43.160]  powerful chapters are the last four chapters so it's Moroni chapter seven
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.560]  to ten I recommend if you read if you don't read anything else read those
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.840]  last four chapters and you know if we do the these two basic things God will lead
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:57.720]  us to what we need to do to fight against tyranny and support freedom very
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:02.120]  interesting what's your take on courts telling Second Amendment advocates that
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.840]  they can't have their free speech gag order sought for eighth grader arrested
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:12.000]  over NRA and a man facing 13 years in jail in LA for water-soluble chalk with
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.880]  anti-New World Order messages on the sidewalk the judge says do not bring up
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:20.040]  free speech as a defense so so that it can't be mentioned so that so the
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.480]  government loses the appeal this is judges consciously involved in trying to
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:29.520]  defraud justice yeah I think it's ridiculous I myself from I'm an
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:34.400]  artist and you know we all deserve the freedom of speech and expression and
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.720]  yeah well I meant to do this for a while I'm going out in Austin with chalk
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:41.040]  today and I'm gonna drive around all over everything I mean give me a break
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.360]  it's totally First Amendment it washes off the next rain and I think
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.280]  everybody everywhere in fact we should have on July 4th in between hot dogs and
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:55.080]  fireworks I'm I think everybody should go out with chalk under the First
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:58.440]  Amendment no you may be arrested in this tyrant of a country and and right
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:02.880]  anti-New World Order pro-liberty messages you may be founding father quotes on
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.000]  the sidewalk but see if it's little kids out there drawing flowers and out there
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.920]  drawing little houses they don't arrest them they don't want you having your
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.760]  speech they want you to pay your money to them and take some vaccines and roll
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.000]  over and die and you know what I told them they go right to Hades
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.160]  thank you William Charles and Georgia you're on the air go ahead hello sir it's
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.720]  a pleasure to be with you and I've been a listener for about four years now I'm
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:33.200]  well awake and I want to address this issue about the federal court makes gay
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:39.840]  marriage legal I don't know whether that you saw that it came in the day where
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.440]  you got all kind of new just type in federal court makes gay marriage legal
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.040]  and you'll see a ton of articles where it's on different news networks where
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.680]  they've made gay marriage legal and everything and I just want to say that
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:59.000]  the stuff you preach definitely coincides with what the Bible prophecy says
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.640]  and yeah for that it's just amazing to know that there's people out there like
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:09.320]  yourself and other people that you interview and everything that are
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.880]  getting the truth out amongst people because even though we live in a society
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.920]  where people easily get offended by other people telling the truth on there and
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.200]  the Bible says the truth hurts and you're gonna have people that go get
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.920]  offended they're gonna get upset about it but the it has to be preached I mean
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:29.400]  Jesus said in the Bible that you know if they hate if they'll persecute me then
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.840]  they'll persecute those that follow me and those that follow my teachings and
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:37.360]  everything I haven't gotten to the big ruling you can see Drudge report dot com
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.640]  has the big rainbow flag up there and all the latest on it we've got some
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.680]  articles on info wars dot com but again on the surface it sounds like civil
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:49.000]  rights and that's how it's sold but in the reality it's about teaching five
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.920]  year olds about sex it's about the government taking over from parents
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:57.360]  it's about anti-family stuff they do not like marriage they do not like the
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.680]  family that's the government
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:05.440]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives nature

[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:50.040]  listen to us we know what we're talking about the Supreme Court strikes down
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:54.720]  federal law that marriage is between a man and a woman again it's about going
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:58.360]  after marriage people go hey let people live together you know live in peace
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:04.000]  that's how it is on the surface but this agenda in the textbooks in the plans
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.600]  you see how anti-family Hollywood is you see the agenda you see how anti-man it
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:15.960]  is this is a social engineering program to break down society on record on record
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:22.080]  to to tell five-year-olds that Heather has two mommies or you know that Bobby
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:27.800]  has two daddies I mean this is this is this is pedophile behavior forcing down
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:33.960]  the throat of children specifically sexualizing them when they're supposed
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:37.560]  to be innocent you know Jocelyn elders saying let's teach five-year-olds how to
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:42.960]  masturbate reach down and help them it's just the government in our life as MSNBC
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:49.120]  says your kids belong to the state and they've said back in the 40s 50s and
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:56.000]  60s I cover it in the extras of in-game in-game to 2.0 that's online we show
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.400]  the university studies where they said we're gonna promote promiscuity so that
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:05.240]  people have abortions don't have meaningful relationships we're gonna
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:09.880]  promote homosexuality homosexuality has always gone on and I'm not here
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:14.480]  demonizing people the point is is that they're force feeding it ladies and
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:20.240]  gentlemen as just a way to be trendy that's why they're so I mean you see the
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.880]  trends now where where you know a lot of women say they're lesbians but then
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.800]  they end up getting married because they just go become a lesbian for a while
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:32.600]  because that's a trendy thing to do or you know same thing with men and now
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:37.920]  they're just saying we're pansexual we're omnisexual humans have always to some
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:43.000]  degree been like that mammals are the point is is that they are artificially
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.240]  trying to amplify it unnaturally with chemicals in the food and water to
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:52.380]  reduce our population numbers and to break up the family so Clinton is
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:11:00.560]  hailing Supreme Court overturning law he signed there you go I mean it's just
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:05.480]  all part of the two-facedness so nothing belongs to the family that's why they
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:10.240]  say in federal documents do not say husband and wife it's hurtful remember
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.440]  those stories about a month ago we covered they actually says France has
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:20.800]  made it the law see a father see see being straight is a crime ladies and
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.940]  gentlemen I mean look at how they demonize gun owners
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:30.280]  conservatives libertarians they're they're coming after us now the average gay
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:35.240]  person he's not into this but they still will support any policy government
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.040]  puts out because oh that's their friend that's the friend that wants them to
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:44.320]  have rights is that why the government in 1978 on record this has been
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:50.640]  declassified partially is part of a Navy program in a hepatitis operation in
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:59.320]  the village there in New York gave thousands of highly promiscuous gay men
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.520]  who are having hundreds of partners a month very destructive folks very
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:10.000]  destructive lifestyle at that level HIV just like Bayer helped pass that around
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.920]  as well oh they they care about you real good they like it you're not gonna have
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.200]  kids they like it you're gonna die alone statistically they like the fact that gay
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:25.240]  men had the lowest life expectancy they want to kill you the last thing they
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:30.240]  want is for you to ever have the joy of children but don't worry don't worry
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:35.280]  they're gonna go take heterosexuals kids they're hunting us this is and give them
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.760]  to the gay couples that that's what goes on I'm supposed to go here take take
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:44.520]  people's kids I mean it's liberal maybe we should sacrifice our kids to a big
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:48.840]  homosexual alter maybe have a pyramid and you go up in the gay priests are there
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.920]  and you like you know they chop your kid up with a meat cleaver you know to prove
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:56.480]  you're not racist or homophobic I mean this every society has done this in
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:02.160]  Sodom and Gomorrah whether you believe the Bible or not the men come to the
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:07.560]  door and say give us those men come out we're going to have sex with you where
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.600]  did they get this idea of a gang of men coming and saying we're going to rape
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:17.520]  you because in every society once this starts the Romans it was outlawed folks
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:21.800]  because they'd seen what happened to other cultures Rome Rose was stoic got
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:25.440]  into this and pretty soon it was Caligula dressed up like a werewolf
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.360]  raping and killing children and I bring this up because this is what all
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:35.480]  elites end up doing raping and killing children dressed up like a werewolf you
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:38.840]  don't know about that look it up they would have big you hundreds of people
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:42.960]  you're laying on the ground at those low tables eating they had vomitoriums you'd
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.880]  eat and eat and eat and vomit and vomit and vomit and then feed the vomit to
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:49.960]  dogs outside I'm not joking look this up called the vomitorium for the word
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:55.720]  vomit comes from or Vulcan vomiting like lava coming out I guess in the Latin
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:00.280]  if memory serves and the point and the whole point that's why it's I guess it's
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:10.160]  also vulgate means to you know project out to speak and so they would go and do
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:13.520]  all this and by the end it was just ripping children's heads off stabbing
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.560]  them chewing their throats out blood spraying all over the walls I mean
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.760]  that's where this goes so so just to understand that's where this goes that's
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:25.360]  what's going to happen that's where it ends I mean look at the BBC every week
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:29.360]  or two there someone's being arrested and pleading guilty to raping nine-year-old
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:35.320]  girls and devil or G's and rape raping five-year-old boys and devil
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.720]  worshiping and necrophilia and hanging out with the royal family and it's so
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.720]  many articles I can't even cover it all because they just want to get it to where
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.080]  they can do whatever they want you understand that so there I've talked
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:54.200]  about what's happening on that front by the way we've gotten in contact good
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:58.040]  idea of them because we pretty much instantly got in contact with some of
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:02.960]  the people that were blind copied the email his good friends from Michael
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:07.640]  Hastings and I want to cover that now friend Michael Hastings is working on
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:16.240]  biggest story yet about CIA not about reported love interest or women that the
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:20.960]  media claim were love interest of General Petraeus
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:25.480]  Sergeant Joe Biggs says journalists would never have driven in high speed and
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:30.600]  said that he's talked to the wife who he's good friends with and that she's
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:37.600]  scared to go public and that when she gets more information on what she
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.600]  believes is happening she will quote take down whoever did this and that
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:45.200]  everyone that knew him said that he was scared they were coming after him he'd
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.680]  they'd never seen him so flustered and he'd been in combat zones for years
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:52.320]  folks he was a embedded combat reporter with the Marines in the army and I
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:58.080]  racked for years in Afghanistan for years and they'd never seen him even in
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:01.960]  combat situations act like this and you know what happened to him a few hours
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:07.560]  later so I want to go to a clip with Megan Kelly so we can analyze this
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:12.800]  propaganda which talks about tenfold hats and stuff with Sergeant Joe Biggs
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:17.440]  who by the way may be on the show today let's go ahead and go to that clip
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:25.200]  question whether this was truly an accident um it's the fact the way that
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:32.280]  I've the other times we've spoken before and this email I got it was just very
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:35.440]  panicked and it didn't seem like something normally we would talk about
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:42.200]  and I just felt a gut feeling something didn't feel right but the police say
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:45.640]  it's an accident they they you know looked into it they said look he was
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:50.240]  driving fast it was 4 30 in the morning it was dark lost control of the car went
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:56.160]  through a red light hit a tree well his friends and family they know him everyone
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:00.440]  says he drives like a grandma so that right there doesn't seem like something
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:03.840]  that he would be doing I mean he had a lot of friends and family that cared
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:07.960]  about him he had a good life to live there's no way he would be acting
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:12.040]  erratic like that and driving that out of control what what do you think is
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.720]  going on here I mean because we've talked about this a couple of times just
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:18.440]  because it's getting so much attention on the internet and and people who are
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:23.040]  close to mr. Hastings are still raising questions questions about the LAPD
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:26.960]  and their conclusions that this was an accident what is the alternate theory
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:31.360]  that he was that he was murdered that he was intentionally targeted by someone
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:41.080]  I don't know that I just know that from the email to hours later dying it's
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:44.160]  just not a coincidence like that things won't add up there's a lot of questions
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:49.920]  that need to be answered my contacted by email Mercedes a day ask them if it's
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:56.640]  normal for their cars to blow up to that extent for if the engines fly out on a
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:01.960]  normal basis I mean these are the real questions we need to ask and what of the
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:05.440]  I mean obviously who's investigating a couple of high-profile cases he was
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:11.280]  looking into he said Jill Kelly who was connected with the whole well that's
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:16.920]  been general general Clark go ahead his wife today said that that's definitely
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:21.600]  not true that he was investigating into Jill Kelly Michael Hastings wife says
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:26.960]  he was not investigating that yes okay well what was he investigating as far
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:31.200]  as you know that would have caused any consternation whatsoever by someone
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:36.520]  CIA but from what he said or his last one of the things he said is it was going
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:42.160]  to be the biggest story yet the you know you know how people gonna react to this
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:46.040]  they're gonna say that the tinfoil hat people think the government killed this
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:50.280]  journalist by taking over his control of his car doing something to his car and
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:55.000]  and the other people gonna say so there are people gonna say that's that's nuts
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.200]  oh yeah nobody ever killed journalist no no no I mean I kind of understand both
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.640]  of you points but like I said he's not someone that would be driving around
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:08.680]  erratically like that in the middle of the night that just wasn't how he was so
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:13.640]  that just leaves a lot of questions and a lot of digging that need to be brought
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:17.800]  up and answered I'm not gonna speculate and say I think anything because that's
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.920]  just gonna make me look crazy well no one wants that we just want answers no
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:30.280]  one wants that is now basically a crime in this country and that's why that they
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:34.120]  can disappear your neighbors and people say I'm not gonna be kooky don't know
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.920]  where the Joneses went this is how Nazi Germany happens right now I mean they
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:43.680]  are killing journalists all over the place constantly now and I mean they've
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:48.640]  had the troops pull up in Baghdad and with it with tanks attack the Reuters
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:55.360]  floor of a building under orders of course they killed me they blew his car

[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:23.280]  very suspicious 98% chance they blow him up if I said if it comes out that he's
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:28.840]  doing a big story if it comes out that he was on the run if it comes out the
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.520]  car blew up and people like no no it blew up this is on Wednesday morning
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:38.520]  right after it happened on Tuesday and hadn't got any covers the first day it
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:43.160]  happened and it just fits the total MO so we're gonna be getting into that
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:51.040]  Roman the Yempolinsky open pronouncing that right he's been on the broadcast
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:57.520]  before is a computer engineering and computer science professor and director
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:02.840]  of cybersecurity lab and we're gonna get into his whole bio and exactly where
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:10.360]  he works now he's worked all over the place and he's the guy that he's the guy
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.800]  that a few years ago sort of coming out saying look we're gonna end up having a
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:24.640]  Skynet type of scenario here if all of this continues and now it's all coming
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:27.240]  true I mean here are some of the articles that I've got that will be
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:31.240]  showing TV viewers on the document cam forget to take your medication these
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:38.080]  pills will tell your doctor I mean it just goes on and on with your your
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.280]  smart meter watching you in your house and ground-pentrating radar the
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:46.760]  establishment is putting the architecture of control in so they can
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:55.800]  control us with the technocracy what the professor has pointed out is that what's
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:00.400]  happening here is that the machines could actually do this and I know I I
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.440]  butchered your bio sir what what's most important for viewers out there to know
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:10.120]  about you my computer science professor I do research in artificial
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:13.960]  intelligence and security that's pretty much what they need to know and I know
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:17.680]  you've worked at it quite a few universities currently where are you a
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.480]  professor I'm at the university of Louisville department of computer
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:24.440]  engineering computer science so the same place when we had you on last time
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:29.400]  yep well I mean since you wrote about that a few years ago it's really become
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.920]  a bigger issue and we hear about all these backdoor chips and things what do
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.520]  you think about what the establishment has decided to do with the
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:45.080]  architecture of the atronic state are you asking if there are backdoors and
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:50.440]  majority of sure what is your view of the design the overall design of the
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:55.880]  technological system being put in can you be a little more specific about
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:01.280]  which aspects you sure I mean look the entire grid is being built so they can
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:06.440]  spy on us and control us and and remote control our cars everything else this
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.800]  looks like it's Taylor made for an artificial intelligence to be able to
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:15.000]  take over it does require something capable of processing massive data big
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.200]  data as we know it it's not possible for human being to monitor all the databases
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:24.320]  all the sensors so it definitely would require some sort of intelligent
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:29.320]  technology as far as is it specifically built for this purpose is it just a
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:33.560]  side effect of having more and more technology in our lives I'm not really
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:42.400]  sure about that again professor yonpolsky is our guest this is just a short
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.880]  segment we'll get more into detail in the next segment if people want to check
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:52.280]  out your work what is the best place to go to Louisville edu and then just go
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:56.160]  to the computer engineering and science program that you had up just Google
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:00.920]  Google my name Roman Yonpolsky I'm sure you can put it up on a screen also my
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:05.480]  new book artificial superintelligence a futuristic approach first hit on Google
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:10.960]  just look for that that's what I wanted to get you on about today and then I've
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:15.240]  been so sideswiped by all this Hastings news coming out but let's briefly speak
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:19.680]  about that the former head of national security Richard Clark has said these
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:24.800]  new cars can be taken over and remote controlled DARPA admits that and some are
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.640]  saying he may have been remote controlled and run into the tree I'm not
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:31.160]  even saying that's what happened it looks like a car bomb to me my issue is
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:38.520]  that shows how our society is being taken over you can definitely have ways
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:43.720]  to hack medical devices self-driving cars anything which is autonomous can be
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:50.560]  hacked and compromised and taking over in principle I just have a feeling of
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:58.240]  dread about what's going to happen with all this going in it is dangerous but
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:01.480]  this is exactly where my research comes in I'm trying to make those systems
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:07.600]  safer more secure combining security and artificial intelligence in one area of
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.560]  research well I know you're a leading expert who really isn't even negative
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:15.400]  you just go from a more realistic angle than something like Ray Kurzweil that
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:19.440]  just says it's gonna be wonderful heaven we're gonna live forever there'll be no
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:24.720]  problems put the robots in charge now I'm gonna be God and that's a quote I
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.760]  don't believe in God yet I'm gonna be God we're gonna come back sir and talk
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:33.040]  about your new book which I need to get and read and and talk about real
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:38.240]  scenarios of what we could face if we don't get control of this technological
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:42.320]  development all this and more straight ahead I'm Alex Jones your host our site

[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:29.680]  GCN radio network
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:38.200]  we're back live ladies and gentlemen and we are talking to a professor who is
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:45.560]  breaking down exactly what he believed from his deep research we're facing and
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:52.400]  professor continuing here today talk about your book talk about you know the
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:57.600]  wide-ranging situation that we're dealing with so the book really is about
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:01.040]  what the future of artificial intelligence is going to bring most
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:05.080]  people agree that in the next 20 to maybe a hundred years we're gonna see
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:08.920]  something developed on the level of human intelligence how is that going to
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:13.480]  change society how is it going to impact all of us my book aims to make sure
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:18.600]  that the humanity is going to benefit from this technology not get hurt in
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:23.560]  some really significant way so that's essentially the main main theme of a
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:29.880]  book it discusses ways we can make those technologies safer heck proof them make
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:40.400]  them serve common people break down for the common person out there exactly the
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:45.720]  type of scenarios that could unfold and have already unfolded with these systems
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:52.800]  so if you realize the number of different jobs who have outsourced to
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:57.960]  artificial intelligence systems they can already control nuclear power plants
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:04.680]  airlines stock trading essentially anything of significance is not done by
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:09.240]  people anymore and this trend only gets more and more severe at some point we'll
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:14.280]  have computers controlling everything and if it is a bug in a system or if an
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:18.560]  enemy hacks into the system this would have devastating effects on the whole
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:22.560]  society and of course that really from my research has been the DARPA plan the
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:26.400]  whole time get the whole world to adopt this system build back doors into it the
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:31.680]  less than builds the giant cyber security commands to offensively take over the
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:35.840]  world professor and then build the back doors end where they can use it to
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:39.640]  suppress and track the general public and even predict the future of mass
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:44.200]  movements that's basically from my research what the Pentagon admits they're
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:49.160]  doing I am not familiar with any insider plans I can notice things like
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:53.600]  NSA distributing cryptographic algorithms which seems like a counterintuitive
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.400]  thing since they're trying to break those so if there was a bad door and
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:02.880]  their hashing algorithm for example I wouldn't be surprised professor
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:09.800]  Yampalski is our guest and you can find out more about him by checking out his
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:16.120]  book and we'll put a screenshot up on the screen for people that are watching us
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:21.120]  on television so they can get the name of that book it's artificial super
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:25.720]  intelligence a futuristic approach and you can actually see one of the
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.560]  professor's interviews with us right there Skynet rising the AI threat to
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:35.040]  humanity exists my issue is are you more concerned about breakdowns in the
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:42.760]  system or or governments using these a dominate or an actual AI type
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:48.640]  artificially aware system coming online and then that that decides to take us
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:53.480]  out like Terminator all of that buff my job is to make sure everybody's safe so
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:59.960]  I can't ignore any opportunities any options it's easier to study and easier
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:04.880]  to justify scenarios where someone is hacking into the system externally
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:11.000]  something like a self-aware AI system going crazy is really futuristic we're
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.160]  not quite at that level yet but something like a government putting a
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:20.200]  backdoor to control the system that's quite realistic that's standard computer
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.600]  security
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:29.720]  professor what do you think of what Ray Kurzweil has to say because for me it's
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:33.560]  more like a comic book the way he puts things out and he admits he's starting
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:38.600]  really a new religion and they're saying you'll either merge with the machines
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:44.400]  or you'll be stepped on like a bug and and they're selling this utopian view
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:47.880]  but when I look at the real technological development and what the
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:52.560]  establishment says they're really building it's more in line with something
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:58.600]  like Elysium the new movie coming out with Matt Damon Kurzweil is probably
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:02.760]  the world's number one expert in that field I mean he's amazing at predicting
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:07.280]  what future of technology is going to be he precisely predicted the year a
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:12.800]  computer will defeat a human chess champion he predicted a lot of our
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:19.920]  technologies he is in my opinion somewhat overly optimistic about how
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:25.200]  beneficial technology will be without spending as much time on possible negative
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:30.040]  side effects which I think are just as important with his recent appointment as
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:34.440]  head of engineering at Google he definitely has financial resources and
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:39.280]  other capacity to make a lot of his dreams come true I wouldn't be surprised
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:44.640]  if they had a very successful AI program at Google as a result of Ray Kurzweil's
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:52.400]  work but my issue is the technocrats I've studied who's running this and they
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.800]  openly say we may just get rid of everybody once this new level of
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:02.040]  evolution takes place we're talking about genocide here and people playing
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:06.240]  God and I don't think the public is even aware that Ray Kurzweil is able to
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.720]  predict a lot of what's coming in the future because he's an insider and kind
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:17.200]  of their front man he's obviously a very smart big inventor he is basically the
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:21.640]  public face of what they're planning to do is my point I mean I'm not even an
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:25.920]  engineer I go off of what they say they're going to do and so that's why he
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:30.200]  knows so much about the goals I mean he wants a technocratic world government
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:34.920]  run by an AI supercomputer that we're we're reportedly going to be given
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:39.440]  eternal life by giving up our humanity and merging with machines sounds like a
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.000]  nightmare to me well even according to Kurzweil it's not going to happen until
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:50.360]  2045 what's going to happen more in the near future is actually beneficial
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:55.520]  improvements for example people with disabilities might get their abilities
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:59.640]  back blind people would be able to see paralyzed people able to walk we're
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:03.680]  already starting to see a lot of this so there is a lot of benefit to this
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:08.200]  technology of course like any technology it can be abused abused by
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:13.520]  governments develop super soldiers all sorts of things but it's important not
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:19.760]  to cast all of technology all of progress as bad there is definitely a very
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:24.720]  significant benefit all of us can gain from those techniques
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:33.800]  what about the general public with lowered IQs lower intelligence they're
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:40.360]  calling it basically computer fog the language is already shrinking people are
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:45.080]  already having their brains rewired at a young age in a bad way I mean all
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:50.240]  timers connected to TV watching I mean I really see a lot of what computers are
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:54.040]  doing is dehumanizing us and hurting us it's not really doing what Ray Kurzweil
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.880]  said there is a lot of negative side effects and especially with kids I'm
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:01.960]  personally very concerned about putting robots in a classroom because those
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:05.280]  things are not tested we don't know if we're gonna get a whole generation of
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:10.360]  children with autism as a result how it impacts their ability to judge body
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:16.160]  language so it is definitely something to look into and have review boards we
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:22.560]  shouldn't just push this new technology and kiss that being said again we are
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:25.800]  using technology right now for this interview they're clearly awesome
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:30.480]  benefits to technology if it's used properly so the important part is to
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:35.640]  strike this balance between the dangers of technology and amazing benefits as
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:41.080]  far as this divide between people getting dumber if they abuse technology and
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:45.760]  solvers getting too much power because we have access to technology it seems that
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:50.680]  the pattern is for technology to get cheaper exponentially so more and more
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:56.320]  people who are not rich necessarily get access to top-notch technology take
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.800]  cell phones 20 years ago only the super rich could have a cell phone now
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:06.800]  everyone has a smartphone farmer in Africa would have more information access
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:11.400]  than the US president had 20 years ago that's incredible even if people are not
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:15.920]  as well educated they still have a lot more tools at their disposal they are
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:23.160]  better connected so again it's a two-inch sort we need to look at both sides
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:29.760]  again my issue is that they're putting all this backdoor tech to spy on us in
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.480]  all the major electronics and then we're having to pay for this because of this
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:40.280]  corporate standardization I'm saying professor I see the architecture of the
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:45.800]  system being built in a predatory way that's my concern and you might be right
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:50.360]  I'm not an expert in that but the only tool we can use to protect ourselves is
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:54.560]  yet more technology if you saying there is a backdoor in that cryptographic
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:59.320]  protocol we need to develop a better open source cryptography to protect people
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:04.480]  so we can't turn away from technology we have to embrace it and take it away from
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:09.160]  government hands and do it ourselves do it let me ask you this professor do you
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:12.000]  in your gut do you think humanity is gonna make it or you think we're gonna
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:17.600]  destroy ourselves I think we're gonna make it we might change ourselves in a
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:23.480]  process not quite as radically as what occurs well my suggest with cyborgs but
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:28.200]  we definitely gonna come to rely on technology a lot more our education
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:32.280]  system will change from memorizing information to learning how to search
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:37.480]  for information we'll really learn to use robots and computers a lot more as
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:43.400]  tools and assistance for everyday life so really many high complexity
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:48.320]  occupations will see robot human teams working together a doctor controlling a
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:53.200]  robot surgeon or something like that sure I mean there's a lot of positive
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:57.360]  things there but the globalists don't want the poor people to have access to
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:00.680]  this revolution that's what they plan to set up a world government forcibly
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:05.560]  reduce world population and then go forward into the next age of man as they
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:09.960]  call it I mean take Foxconn run by the liberal trendies who are really
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:15.480]  authoritarian monsters of Apple with Al Gore on their board they have the most
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:20.360]  oppressive factory subcontractors and demand the highest dehumanization
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:24.520]  programs available and then the suicide nets and so some people commit suicide
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:29.680]  and they drug them into forced abortions at the Foxconn reportedly that now
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.600]  they've just ordered as you know millions of robots that are now replacing
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:40.480]  the humans with them so I don't see that nexus point meeting where where we
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:45.200]  bring in robots and then we just do more advanced things instead we just get
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:49.840]  killed and I think that's the path that's been chosen and Ray Kurzweil is
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:53.160]  not going to tell people that but that's that's actually in the deeper
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:59.760]  literature and Bill Joy wrote about this back in about 13 years ago the head
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.720]  of some micro systems for those that don't know in why the future doesn't need
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:07.520]  us article and he said he talked to colleagues and the you know do we keep
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:10.800]  people alive just let them play games all day or do we get rid of people and
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:14.240]  you know most of them said let's get rid of everybody so I mean I don't know I
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:17.800]  think that might be something we should talk about it is and it's exactly what
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:22.800]  my book is about that's exactly the questions that raises what can we do to
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:26.160]  make sure that we are needed in the future how can we make sure that those
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:33.520]  technologies are not given too much power that's exactly my concern well when
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:36.240]  I heard about your book I wanted to get you on I didn't know that it's not out
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:40.960]  yet and and I really want to support it and you need people support to get it
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:46.320]  out artificial superintelligence a futuristic approach and how do people
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:51.640]  make sure that the book gets out so it's a crowdfunding campaign I'm making it
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:55.520]  open to everyone they can contribute in fact there is an option to become a
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:00.320]  contributor to the book just Google it to Google the title of the book it's an
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:05.480]  indiegogo which is a crowdfunding site and you can contribute as a supporter you
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:10.920]  can pay towards proofreading of the book the more contributions will get with
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:14.480]  sooner will be able to release the book the cheaper it would be to print multiple
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:19.480]  copies essentially I'm looking for a lot of input from top researchers I
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:23.000]  already collaborated with quite a few people you can see on the website
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:28.720]  exactly with whom but I attend all the top conferences in the field I presented
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:32.720]  all the top workshops I really know what the state of the artist I still I know
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:36.320]  that's why we get you on that's why I guess I spend the summer working with
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:40.400]  Ray Kurzweil at Singularity University I know exactly what their process is I
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:45.080]  work with people criticizing him I work with people admiring him I really try
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:51.240]  to come as an impartial scientist and disregard the political aspect of it but
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.520]  find technical solutions to the problem we can't sure I didn't even know that
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:59.440]  you've worked with Ray Kurzweil and I know you've written several other books
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:04.000]  but again I don't want to sit here and judge Ray Kurzweil and say he's a bad
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.400]  guy it's just that he's always promoting world government and and you know
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:12.080]  pushing all this and I recognize the stuff he's pushing I was reading about a
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:16.080]  hundred years ago from the Fabian Socialist and their plan for the world
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:19.640]  and you got a hand it to him they wanted to discover what made humans tick they
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:23.560]  went out and found out DNA but then you see you know the type of stuff Watson
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:29.080]  that discovered it says and I just know it's eugenics based and in the 40s after
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:36.640]  World War two the eugenicists remade themselves as transhumanist and I just
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:41.160]  know that there's a very arrogant anti-human bent in these people and
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:44.920]  they've decided we're junk and they've decided they're gonna decide our course
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:48.400]  I just think the public should have a debate about this and that's what I like
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:52.360]  about you professor is that you're trying to have that debate I couldn't agree
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:56.720]  more I mean I talk to people all the time I just had a lecture to high school
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:00.080]  students for considering computer science and those are the questions I
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.200]  mentioned to them they are going to decide our future they're going to be the
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:07.640]  ones designing those systems what type of moral values do they put in robots and
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:12.800]  military robots what can a drone do are they autonomous are they requiring human
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:17.120]  supervision can we have a politician who is a robot there are lots of questions
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:23.520]  we need to debate a society and those are not easy questions Roman Yonpolsky is
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:29.160]  our guest here today I you know I've been asking a lot of questions a professor
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:35.560]  what are points that you'd like to make that we haven't gotten to yet I
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:39.760]  definitely want to give opportunity to all your listeners to participate in a
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:44.440]  project they can follow me on Twitter Facebook I post constant updates about
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:49.480]  projects how it's going I'm always looking for talented students to join the
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:53.800]  lab so that's another opportunity if any students are interested in doing a PhD
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:49:03.280]  master's thesis in my cyber security lab as far as the topics again we tend to
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:07.720]  concentrate on what our biases our background leads us to some people see
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:12.640]  it as it's going to kill everyone some see it as a heaven and immortality we
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:16.480]  need to realize that reality is going to be somewhere in the middle we're going
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:20.080]  to use those technologies to benefit us and if we're smart enough we're not
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:24.600]  going to end up in an existential catastrophe of some kind where we'll
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:29.440]  have a terminator like scenario ideally we'll manage to avoid that but we
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:33.960]  know exactly but if they've got 30,000 drones last time I checked of the
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:39.760]  predator and reaper class and they're moving the troops to robots I mean you
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:44.040]  can already see the plan to make us obsolete that's my point is that the
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:50.560]  major corporations do not have a good view and and currently I believe from
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:58.000]  the evidence we're on a very bad path that's my point there's a lot of common
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:03.880]  sense things I can agree with you on definitely it's dangerous definitely it
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:08.840]  needs to be looked upon there needs to be oversight not necessarily government
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:14.800]  oversight but research oversight we have a research review boards for medicine
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:19.480]  for nuclear for chemical weapons bio weapons we need something similar for
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:23.760]  projects related to nanotechnology synthetic biology artificial
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:29.480]  intelligence robotics not any type of research should be fully funded by the

[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:16.080]  minutes left here but specifically looking at the NSA the fact that they
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:19.720]  call it national security that these illegal spy grids and they are illegal
[01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:23.160]  around everywhere and then people are traitors that he didn't give away our
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:27.040]  missile secrets he didn't give away how fast aircraft carriers can cruise how
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:30.400]  many knots he said hey they're doing illegal stuff that's always been
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:37.160]  protected what's your view on Snowden? I mean I think terrorists always knew with
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:41.320]  spying on them so he didn't really tell them anything new in my opinion I know
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:46.320]  bin Laden never used cell phones never used email always relied on snail mail
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:53.400]  and that's why he was so successful at avoiding capture for years as far as
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:57.400]  normal people I mean I was raised in Soviet Union I pretty much assumed
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:02.200]  government is always spying on you anyway so also I didn't see much of a
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:07.120]  revelation there I don't have any political statement to make as to
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:13.640]  whatever my judgment is in his actions I just don't see it as something very novel
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:19.280]  by the way Lindsey Graham has come out and called for reading people's mail now
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:24.480]  just a physical mail I mean that's up on info wars.com enemy of
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:28.200]  freedom Lindsey Graham says he would support censoring mail for national
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:32.560]  security purpose they call it censoring to dig through your mail I mean there is
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:36.880]  just another saying Al Qaeda knows our secrets now our government's running Al
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:42.760]  Qaeda in Syria folks I mean this is all such a sick joke professor in closing
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:48.640]  that's where I see the big advances is in this synthetic biology that that's
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:54.520]  what I'm really concerned about it could be very very beneficial again we can
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:59.960]  get rid of a lot of genetic disorders we can design much better plants and
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:05.440]  foods and medicines but it could also create horrible biological weapons it
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:10.760]  could create terrible mutations which we cannot test for multiple generations of
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:14.520]  human life it takes too many years so they test for a year or two and they
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:18.800]  release those products so that could be potentially very very dangerous. Wow you
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:22.520]  know your stuff because I've studied it yeah you can have the change in one
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:26.160]  generation but by three it does something completely different I mean it is
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:31.000]  Russian roulette all over the place I wish your book well people should go

[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:56.000]  topic you want to bring up I already covered this but man I tell you it is
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:02.920]  chilling to read these quotes that I saw in an RT article that then we put an
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:07.840]  article Michael Hastings friend of Michael Hastings says he was working on
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:12.720]  biggest story yet about CIA and we have that Fox News clip but then in the RT
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:17.440]  article and we have this in detail in our article on infoworks.com Michael
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:22.720]  Hastings wife vows to quote take down whoever did this and that's reportedly
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:27.680]  what Sergeant Joe Biggs told Fox News Megan Kelly that something didn't feel
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:32.680]  right and then you have witnesses saying they heard an explosion look like it
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:36.760]  blew up the fact that he was saying he was going off the radar yeah you can't
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:40.760]  criticize anybody for saying this is suspicious you can't you'd have to be
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:48.600]  crazy not to say it's suspicious like Pat Tillman and I talked to his brother
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:52.480]  pretty soon after it happened and he wasn't ready to come on the air at that
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:55.680]  time my producer talked to him and I got a hand of the phone and got talked to
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:58.560]  him but they were like we think more happened we think it's a cover-up and
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:03.440]  then it came out the coroner would lie the army coroner a colonel the tenant
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:08.000]  colonel and said he was killed up close with it with a three-shot burst and
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:14.120]  in the front of the head and so I mean again we got criticized then for saying
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:18.600]  could this have been some type of assassination bare minimum ladies and
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:23.040]  gentlemen they lied about it so he was charging a machine gun nest and it was
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:27.600]  McChrystal involved in that cover-up but he was working on this big story they
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.000]  put up this other story that he was investigating Kelly who might or might
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.200]  not have supposedly you know been about to have a relationship or something with
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:40.840]  Petraeus it's total distraction in my view and the wife of Michael Hastings
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:49.560]  has come out and said that he was not working on that story it was the CIA and
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:56.400]  it was the biggest thing ever so we are going to have one of his friends pop in
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:00.320]  at the bottom of the hour I'll leave that as a surprise in the meantime we're
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:03.200]  going to break here in a moment this is a short little segment come back and go
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:08.040]  directly to your calls Jim and Frank and everybody else that I just mentioned
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:13.680]  earlier but you know they're now in the news telling us give up all your rights
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:19.680]  of the terrorist will get you what about the the corrupt interests that run the
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:25.640]  government aren't they the big threat historically Eisenhower told the
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:28.680]  University commencement speech I've read the quote on air getting back to
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:33.800]  Eisenhower that you can have total security but we'll have to put you in
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.720]  prison to paraphrase the quote and that's basically paraphrasing what
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:41.880]  Thomas Jefferson said and Benjamin Franklin they all said those that give
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:47.760]  up liberty for supposed security deserve and we'll get neither you don't ever
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:53.720]  get security especially long-term giving up your rights and becoming dependent
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:04:00.440]  you become a slave and what we have is a bunch of corporate special interest that
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:05.720]  want to continue wars that's why they give the last generation of weapons to
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:09.800]  all these foreign governments that we develop like China and Russia and even
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:14.240]  North Korea got reactors so then there can be a threat and we've got to have
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:19.920]  this big military industrial complex to fight that it just goes on and on and on
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:25.400]  and now millions of dollars per city for robots for non-existent bomb events
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:30.640]  and just and all the movies are about martial law and and another using the
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:38.120]  NSA to go after whistleblowers I mean this is unprecedented has the name it's
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:41.440]  called organized crime takes over the government and the name of that is

[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:28.880]  we have a special guest who was good friends with mr. Hastings who blew up
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:34.480]  joining us unfortunately very sad a really good reporter I mean that clip
[02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:37.840]  where I played yesterday where he fought for he died a few days before he was on
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:42.400]  TV and he said the press has to organize against tyranny we have to stand up the
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:45.160]  government is trying to destroy free press in this country of the press
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:49.280]  doesn't stand up for it for itself nobody will and then I'm going to do at
[02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:53.160]  least 30 minutes of overdrive today with our guests that are with us for the
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:57.640]  next two days James Lane and Richard Grove they're going to be with us
[02:08:57.640 --> 02:09:02.200]  tomorrow in studio as well because I've kind of moved them into overdrive today
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:06.320]  they're down here down here visiting and they're the makers of the new film that
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:09.800]  we're pre-selling and we're gonna premiere on prison planet TV but the DVD in
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:13.560]  the Blu-ray of state of mind it's an amazing film that I'm in a bunch of
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:17.360]  other people even more knowledgeable than I am are very very powerful we're
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:21.920]  going to be talking about that some of the next hour right now let's go to Jim
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:26.000]  in New Hampshire you're on the air welcome Jim
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:32.080]  hello Alex I love the show and I so I wanted to make a point about about the
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:37.800]  use of encryption and that we you know we should really be considering this as
[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:45.520]  as a way of helping toward the NSA is spying on you know domestic spying I
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:49.520]  think one of the things that you know there's actually two technologies out
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:54.360]  there that I want to quickly mention one is just encryption in general which
[02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:59.360]  actually as as Snowden mentioned in his question and answer it's actually a
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:03.720]  really effective way to prevent someone from from intercepting your message
[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:07.800]  well don't I mean it isn't the best system not even encrypting it yourself but
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:11.600]  those systems that slice it up a thousand different ways and then recombine it
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:15.880]  on the other end exactly yeah there are systems that do that so it's a lot of
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:19.560]  software engineers that's my background and yes there's a whole bunch of
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:23.520]  encryption there's actually different your methods of encryption different
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:27.480]  systems out there but basically I just want the users here to know you know
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:31.560]  start using it start looking into start researching and whatever encryption you
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:36.000]  said to use this will help you know this will help in that we will have sure
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.760]  because yeah I mean they can still crack it but they have to sit there and mess
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:42.800]  with it and put it through different filters and if there's hundreds of
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:46.200]  different types of encryption being used then it's going to come up their
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:51.120]  works exactly right right they can still crack it but you know frequently even
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:55.800]  even the simplest things algorithms can take you know years sometimes to crack
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:11:01.800]  even simple but also you can use things like start page and and other free search
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:06.040]  engines so you're through a proxy so that you're not just volunteering to go
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:09.440]  right to the corporate NSA and just give them everything and actually you're
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:12.080]  making my next point for me that's exactly what I was gonna say start page
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:15.800]  of the great you know anything that hides you from Google and hides you from
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:20.600]  from you know the powers to be watch that's a great place to start also
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:26.560]  looking for peer-to-peer networks PEP networks use the kind of disperse the
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:31.680]  network traffic around so you can't track people as easily you know that the
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:34.360]  unfortunate part is we shouldn't really even have to do any of this we should
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:37.280]  really you know we should be able to communicate without thinking anybody's
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:40.640]  listening to it again it's not that you're hiding something why do you lick
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:44.240]  the envelope with snail mail it's so it doesn't fall out it's so people don't
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:47.120]  read it and it's not that you're hiding something if you're sending your
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:51.520]  grandmother some photos of a picnic or something because she asked for them
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:55.480]  that's what my grandma is always asking for photos of the trips and things she
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:59.640]  loves photos she's almost 90 years old but it's nobody's business I mean why
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:04.600]  do I have walls on my house why isn't my house glass I mean what do I have to
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:08.840]  hide nothing I want to be able to walk around you know at midnight my
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:13.600]  underwear and I don't think my neighbors want to see that either you know I don't
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:18.480]  look like Kate Upton so good good points I appreciate I appreciate I
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:26.080]  appreciate you calling in I better not make Kate up Kate Upton jokes cuz never
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:30.800]  mind let's just go ahead and talk to Eric in Pennsylvania no no wait wait he
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:39.360]  wasn't next I apologize Frank on Obamacare listening on 840 a.m. KCBC in
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:43.160]  Cali you're on the air Frank thanks for holding how you doing first time caller
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:47.920]  Alex the first thing you the greatest American I've ever known and my prayers
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:52.760]  are with you for you and your warriors my goodness please come on we have nothing
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:59.960]  to fear but fear itself Obamacare HR 3200 1001 speaks of this implantable chip
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:03.880]  it's gonna have your name your phone number your bank account your dog's
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:10.440]  middle name let's be technical it does fund in Obamacare it cuts funding for
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:13.400]  all the surgeries and stuff you need and let's government tell your doctors
[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:16.640]  what to do and is written by insurance companies to jack up prices and cut
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:20.520]  quality of care and bring in the death panels which they now admit they have but
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:25.520]  it does fund implantable microchips in the body and I some say that means they
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:31.320]  can make it happen but it does funded and it has this hub system that under law
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:36.080]  forces all your data illegally to give it to all these federal state and
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:41.600]  corporate groups so it's also a big NSA thing yeah and another thing our brains
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:47.320]  are also on radio waves so once you get that chip can't they control our minds
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:51.240]  to I mean it might well to be specific DARPA admits for about 50 years they can
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:57.240]  put out different wavelengths that calm people or make them agitated just like
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:01.360]  loud sound can make you agitated or nails on a chalkboard but but this is
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:05.760]  different harmonics they have and there is a lot of that going on most of its
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:12.080]  classified but the existence of it is there and generally it wouldn't be a
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:16.520]  chip they put in you to control your mind they would give you a vaccine that
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:21.480]  had a synthetic by biological nanotech engineered virus which they already have
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:26.800]  that goes in and destroys areas of the cerebral cortex associated with
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:31.120]  resistance and they call that the anti-stress vaccine you know if you watch
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:36.520]  the lobotomized biological androids in Disney's the black hole they're not
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:40.640]  having any anxiety because they've been lobotomized I mean if you watch the one
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:43.840]  who flew over the cuckoo's nest that accurately shows what lobotomies like
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:47.680]  these are more of a slight lobotomy and there's evidence they've already been
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:51.560]  testing and on the public where people just can't get upset but they can still
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:55.600]  be ordered around and told what to do but the public's already liked that
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:58.720]  without the brain-eating vaccine as I dub it I'll have a whole video on that
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:02.560]  just Google brain-eating vaccine they're already liked that to a great extent just
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:07.280]  from TV and culture they're taught to shuffle around you know just just just
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:12.280]  kind of muffling stumbling through life because they've been spectators their
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:17.840]  whole life wired like Plato's allegory of the cave to just watch the images on
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:24.400]  the wall not to actually be part of the real world well all right that's it man
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:27.160]  could I plug a book is that possible absolutely you're on the air brother we
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:32.760]  don't screen your course man conspiracy 101 amazon.com has a list of
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:36.720]  everything that you need to get started and find out the truth sure are you
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:41.000]  listening to us on 840 a.m. right now you got it brother well that's awesome I
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:45.440]  thought they were only carrying us on the weekends no they got you 9 to 12 man
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:49.920]  and right now that's all I can afford and I'm so happy to hear yeah that's a
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:56.960]  big station yeah it's great man well I tell you I mean it's awesome how many
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:01.680]  stations put us on on the weekend and then we're weekdays in in major cities
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:11.040]  all over the country Chicago you know San Diego Dallas but the problem is take
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:16.480]  take Orlando we were on there one year the station went from like number eight
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:22.120]  or nine in the ratings to number one with my show and man Cal before me they
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:26.200]  put us both on and then they just changed formats and it's like man being
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:32.000]  number one on a station up against 50,000 waters a 10,000 water and I've done
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:37.240]  that over and over again it's like being number one is not enough folks I just
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:42.000]  and I'm not like wanting to beat Rush Limbaugh either it's just that we we
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:47.120]  destroyed him and it was in the news it was in radio magazines that I've gone up
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:50.920]  against and I'm not up against Limbaugh on purpose this was the slot I was offered
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:55.800]  in 1998 they said you want to go weekdays on this little network we're
[02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:58.920]  putting you out here that's where we have a slot and I went up against Rush
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:04.320]  Limbaugh and they said yes and so that's why I'm there I wanted to be on at
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:09.000]  nights quite frankly kind of wake up at night and but I mean I've been up
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:15.160]  against Limbaugh toe-to-toe well hundreds of times because you know stations
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:19.720]  come and go over the years but I mean there are at least more than 20
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:26.160]  occasions that we have come up to him in the ratings or destroyed him and again
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:30.240]  I'm not trying to destroy him you know physically get him off the air it's just
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:34.960]  that I will defeat Rush Limbaugh in the free market of ideas people people like
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:38.320]  this show more than his and I'm on a little radio network that's now got
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:43.160]  1400 affiliates not my show but Genesis has 1400 that's a conservative number
[02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:45.960]  by the way so we're not a little network we were a little network it's the
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:50.040]  American dream it's the idea people want hardcore libertarian and patriot news
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:54.640]  they want an unvarnished and they get it here and and and I will destroy all
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:58.520]  the competition if I put on a level playing field in fact on a stilted
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:01.600]  playing field I'll beat them but I've never given that chance it's the
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:06.680]  stations always sell thank you so much Frank I spread the word to all the 840
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:10.320]  lessers tell everybody on every station you're listening to us tell people to
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:15.320]  tune into your local AM and FM's right now let's go take a quick call here Bruce
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:20.520]  in Michigan you're on the air thanks for holding hi I have two practical
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:26.320]  problems I wonder if you have answers to them sure brother I'll try them I got a
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:30.680]  letter in the mail from the Department of Health and Human Services US Public
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:38.520]  Health that's a RTI project 12800 it says that I've been chosen among 200,000
[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:44.200]  people randomly by the Research Triangle Institute for a national study on health
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:48.520]  related issues an interviewer will come I'm reading these three paragraphs real
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:52.880]  quick here and show you their ID card her name is Jill Blondan it shows a
[02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:58.400]  facsimile of the ID card now you do not have to participate in this but then it
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:03.440]  says in great big black writing here every person who chooses to complete the
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:08.360]  interview will receive $30 in cash all the information is confidential
[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:12.080]  assured by federal law blah blah blah blah I wonder what the heck is this thing
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:16.640]  should I just keep them out of the house they go what this is and then the
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:20.000]  people involved in it don't even know this but rank corporations put out the
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:24.680]  plans others to put out similar plans they're sending now monthly census to

[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:57.760]  in America boy let me tell you but I don't know the particular group you're
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:02.800]  talking about it brings a little bit of a bell most of these people are
[02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:08.480]  literally just doing a job contracted by the government as that letter said and
[02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:14.160]  that they they think they're out helping people but sometimes though they
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:19.000]  send another group to to go match up people that are on disability or other
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:22.560]  issues to see if you've been telling the truth and the person coming to
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:26.840]  interview you doesn't even know why doesn't even know why they're coming
[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:32.800]  they're compartmentalized in fact most cases they are so as a rule I don't talk
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:37.480]  to anybody police come to my door and they say open the door I'll say what's

[02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:59.680]  history of lying and setting people up well is this true or is this not true
[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:05.560]  I'm not talking to you like I've actually before to the FBI said see my hand
[02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:11.760]  talk to it but we're gonna get a subpoena bring it talk to my hand then I
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:14.840]  go hey you know the government chips in the narcotics and I follow them out to

[02:26:41.420 --> 02:26:47.360]  Europeans pension funds that they paid for private and public I know that the
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:50.240]  people work for the government now are gonna have their way of life destroyed
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:54.360]  as well so I'm a little bit angry at them that their victims too and they're
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:59.400]  acting all high and mighty to me when all I do is study this I know what I'm

[02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:17.000]  lot of mistakes either but I try instead of an expert on football or an expert on

[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:24.760]  expert on how to go on the best vacations I decided my life was gonna

[02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:01.840]  has been confirmed in the FBI's been saying they didn't that's really creepy
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:07.240]  and then his car blows up and from a lot of the military experts we've had on
[02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:11.360]  they say it looks like a car bomb you get the former national security
[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:15.880]  advisor to three administrations Richard Clark comes out and says well there is
[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:20.000]  remote controlling of these high-tech cars well that's well known DARPA has
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:24.680]  come out and said that's the case but if you don't look at this as foul play
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:29.800]  then there's something wrong with you I mean you could say perhaps this really
[02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:36.600]  happened but to say don't look at it when day one I came out and said to
[02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:41.640]  everybody that hey we should look at this I said I don't know that Wednesday
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:45.480]  after it happened the day after I said I don't know but if he was working on a
[02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:50.040]  big story if you know a lot of governments go after people private
[02:34:50.040 --> 02:34:52.920]  corporations go after people journalists have always been targeted for
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:57.480]  hundreds of years so to say oh it's ridiculous nobody's been targeted when
[02:34:57.480 --> 02:35:01.080]  I've known journalists like Pulitzer Prize winner Gary Webb they shot twice
[02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:05.080]  in the head and he said he was getting death threats and they wouldn't kill
[02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:11.520]  himself on my show and they killed him the DC madam same thing and so he this
[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:16.720]  man has a lot of courage staff sergeant Joe Biggs told Fox News is Megan Kelly
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:22.040]  that something didn't feel right and he went on in a RT article that we have
[02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:26.960]  one info wars calm Michael Hastings wife vows to take down whoever did this
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:31.280]  that's a quote and that's pretty bombshell so he joins us now and I
[02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:35.800]  think the best place to start was who Michael Hastings was how staff sergeant
[02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:41.360]  you know Biggs points out in the quotes here that hey if this happened to me
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:45.800]  Michael Hastings would be sticking up and investigating for me and that
[02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:50.480]  everybody else is too scared to talk wow so wherever you'd like to start sir I
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:55.840]  appreciate you coming on well thanks for asking me on you bet you've got the
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:35:59.560]  floor gummy tell us whatever you think you should get across people all right
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:06.520]  well you know like I said back in 2008 I was deployed in South Providence in
[02:36:06.520 --> 02:36:13.360]  Afghanistan and my commander pulled me in his office and he's like well we're
[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:18.480]  gonna have a two embedded a journalist the photographer and well photographer
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:22.680]  handle journalists and they're gonna follow you around for the next week or
[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:28.800]  so the next week or so turned in to almost about three months and you get to
[02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:35.280]  one day of combat let alone three months of being around them he was this was his
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:40.440]  first time in that kind of a situation to if I'm not mistaken actually in
[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:47.120]  Afghanistan doing that and I was telling people they were like well how was my
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:51.240]  cause like you were the fearless guy I mean I can remember one day and in
[02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:55.920]  particular right around the Pakistan border we were being ambushed and the
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:59.840]  firefighters going over I'm looking on or looking over to Michael and he's
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:03.120]  looking up he's like it's over yet he's like there more and like he just looks
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:09.560]  excited like he loved his job and there wasn't a thing to scare him so when the
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:14.520]  email comes to me and well from 2008 on him and I would talk all the time he's
[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:19.800]  asking me I was doing how you know I was coming I was having nightmares I was
[02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:24.040]  coming back I was dealing with a lot of stuff with you know some deaths of people
[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:27.680]  over there and it was just a hard time and Mike was one of the guys that called
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:32.200]  me up from date you know time to time and check on me so we both a pretty
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:36.280]  strong relationship but that's it and from time to time he would email me and
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:39.440]  tell me about stories he's working on and ask me what I thought about this if
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:43.000]  you ever wrote about something bad to do the military I remember when the story
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:47.520]  broke on General McCrystal he gave me a call and he's like man I'm pretty scared
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:52.720]  and you know I told him I was like you got every reason to be brother I was like
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:58.080]  you just basically got a general level war fired I'm pretty sure that doesn't
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:03.000]  fit too well with him right now and he went on to just share concerns about how
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:06.440]  you know he knew there was probably a chance of people to be looking into him
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:12.640]  and I completely understand that so last Monday morning I wake up and I get
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:16.240]  the email from Mike and usually the email start off with a brother how's it
[02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:20.040]  going you know how's your family how are you adjusting the civilian life because
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:24.160]  I'm out of the military now this time it was just that everyone has the email
[02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:27.760]  because I released it you know saying that he believed the FBI was gonna be
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:32.480]  investigating his colleagues and close friends and it just didn't seem like
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:38.040]  something that he normally started the email off with and when I read it I just
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:41.440]  got this horrible feeling like something's not right I immediately called him
[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:45.760]  but I didn't get an answer I was like well he's probably busy so I go to school
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:50.040]  and try to brush it off like you know what do you think about this I don't think
[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:53.760]  something's right you know what if a friend sent you this email how would you
[02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:57.400]  react and a lot of them were like man that's scary stuff I don't know what to
[02:38:57.400 --> 02:39:03.400]  do so I go to a work event I come home and a friend told me that night she's
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:07.400]  like hey did you hear what happened to Mike and I said what do you mean he died
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:13.000]  in a crash so I jumped on the turn on my TV on the internet and started looking up
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:18.720]  stuff and sort of watching these videos and things just getting out of you know
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:23.200]  first email that I'm reading that he called the WikiLeaks lawyer which that
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:30.480]  I'm not sure about I know he contacted a lawyer in recent days but the whole
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:34.640]  WikiLeaks lawyer I'm not sure about that but then the crash why was there an
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:39.160]  investigative reporter happened to be filming with a dash cam right as Michael
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:43.440]  drove by I mean who's out filming an empty street at four or something in the
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:49.240]  morning I mean all these alarms were going off my gut feeling from day one
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:52.960]  from before it happened I knew that something wasn't right there's so many
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:59.180]  things that added up and did Afghanistan and all those years of combat did that
[02:39:59.180 --> 02:40:07.000]  hone your gut instinct yeah I just just just anybody who knows someone and they
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:12.320]  act out of out of reason out of like their normal behavior you know that
[02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:15.520]  should go off on that should send a red light off to anybody was you know that
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:19.440]  had a close friend let's talk about let's talk about and then all the points
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:22.720]  you want to get into but let's talk about why you decided to go public you
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:25.840]  talked about the rest of the people that were sent to email his close friends
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:29.880]  and family like yourself are scared and I know you've had a chance to talk to
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:34.400]  some of them describe how they're scared and then there's the FBI denying he
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:38.360]  sent emails and stuff meanwhile you know there was an email so I guess that's
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:42.760]  why you released it or correct me if I'm wrong but let's get into they're too
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:47.160]  scared to release an email that the FBI may rate us and they're talking to my
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:51.560]  friends and family he wouldn't lie about that and then meanwhile I'm going off
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:56.080]  the radar that's I'm going into hiding wow I mean I hope I don't say I'm going
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:04.880]  into hiding look out and my car blows up I mean wow yeah I actually email some
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:08.560]  of the people that were on that that he sent the names on the email to some of
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:13.840]  the people above these and I said hey did you guys get that email now he's
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:18.760]  dead does anybody else think that's weird I got one response back yeah and I go
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:22.800]  yeah question mark question mark question mark that's it and I waited five
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:26.320]  minutes and I mean five minutes you know after your friend died seems like
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:29.880]  an eternity and no one's saying anything and I'm getting on the internet and I'm
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:33.840]  like alright somebody's got to come out and say something someone's got a I can't
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:38.720]  be the only person that thinks this is just weird so I asked my mom asked some
[02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:41.600]  people they're like what you know I was like what should I do and everyone's
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:45.040]  like they're not some scary stuff to get into and I just asked her for a minute
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:50.400]  and basically said that's it I'm just gonna do it and Mike would do the same
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:55.800]  thing for me he's not gonna sit back and roll over and you know I'm not a
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:42:01.080]  journalist I'm not an investigator I don't know what steps to take all I know
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:06.480]  is I lost a friend I'm pissed off I want to find out what happened and like I
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:09.280]  told his wife and some of his other friends I'm gonna do whatever the hell I
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:12.640]  got to do to figure this out and at the end of the day it turns out to be an
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:16.880]  accident then whatever but right now things don't have to be that way there's
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:22.800]  too many unanswered questions that need to be sure let me tell you when you're
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:26.440]  really gonna wake up I've been physically attacked by the shadow
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:30.520]  government I've been threatened I've seen amazing things and and so many
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:35.400]  times it's why we've got to engage in investigative journalists and investigative
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:41.720]  journalism is so you'll find out for yourself how corrupt things have gotten
[02:42:41.720 --> 02:42:45.080]  I mean look at the NSA being used against the Associated Press look at
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:49.440]  pro-life groups and tea parties being harassed by the IRS I mean this
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:54.160]  government is out of control it's been persecuting journalist and whistleblowers
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:43:00.760]  like no other president before them and so it's not a stretch to say hey he's
[02:43:00.760 --> 02:43:05.240]  got the biggest story ever tell us about that I mean that's in the email well and
[02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:09.360]  he also reportedly told his wife that but specifically give us what info you
[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:15.120]  have staff sergeant Joseph Biggs here joining us in an in-depth interview not
[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:19.440]  just soundbites on Fox News I mean for me that's big too that I'm on this big
[02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:23.000]  story the FBI is probably gonna rate us they're questioning people I'm going
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:30.960]  into hiding boom yeah like I said just that all that leading up that email and
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:36.800]  that happening and there's too many he was on edge I mean everyone that knew him
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:41.360]  was agreeing the day is leaving up he was very on edge and like you said in the
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:44.360]  subject line mentioning the NSA and the thought that the FBI was questioning
[02:43:44.360 --> 02:43:49.560]  friends and associates that alone makes death soon afterwards let me say this
[02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:52.960]  let me say this while I have you I'm begging you to get ahold of his wife
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:57.120]  who you know and I believe me I've studied this I can put her in contact with
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:44:00.680]  with national security whistleblowers and people that have really fought the
[02:44:00.680 --> 02:44:06.080]  system in one whatever she knows the investigation was she's either got to
[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:11.440]  tell the government call the FBI and say I'm never gonna talk about this or
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:16.160]  she's got to go public with all of it and the safest thing is to go public
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:21.680]  immediately do you have any idea what it was dealing with the CIA that he said
[02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:26.280]  was the biggest thing he'd ever had that's all she knew he didn't know
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:30.600]  anything else he told me she said Mike would not tell me anything she said you
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:34.160]  know basically from the sound of that would just be for her own protection
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:39.440]  yeah of course I'm supposed to have the memorial service the bull is it a this
[02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:45.080]  past Saturday a buddy of mine called me and said hey there's a plane leaving in
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:49.000]  two hours let's go up there to the service so I hopped on and flew up to
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:53.560]  Vermont and stayed at a hotel up there and then went and saw his wife and
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:59.720]  family all of them and you know she pretty much came out and said that he
[02:44:59.720 --> 02:45:02.840]  wouldn't tell her anything at all so I don't think you're gonna get anything out
[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:06.440]  of her in that well that's good for her that's good for her because if he told
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:10.320]  any other colleagues anything they're all under NSA surveillance and if this
[02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:14.080]  was a hit which my gut and all evidence says it was there's gonna be more deaths
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:20.160]  on this well I mean I wouldn't be lying if I wouldn't say I wasn't checking my
[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:24.120]  car every damn day I'll tell you that well that's because you've lived in the
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:28.600]  real world I feel sorry for the sheep out there that don't realize that you know
[02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:33.080]  the the press is under attack did you see him on the young Turks but surely
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:40.840]  before he died Mr. Hastings I was just watching that last night and he said we
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:44.720]  declare war on this corrupt system that's declared war on the press the
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:49.600]  press has to stand up together and they were afraid of that colonel Travis type
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:53.640]  attitude I'm telling you they were scared of him well Michael wrote one of his
[02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:56.800]  books and I've read it that he had been told that we don't like what you write
[02:45:56.800 --> 02:46:02.200]  will haunt you down and kill you so I mean that's you know for him to say
[02:46:02.200 --> 02:46:06.880]  something like that those are his own words that's pretty pretty intense I
[02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:09.760]  haven't read the books but obviously I need to look them up you know which one
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:15.960]  of his books I can get back to on that one I mean I'll search and guys search
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:20.000]  Hastings books there's the operators and there's one other I read part of the
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:24.680]  operators online the operators I don't think it's in that one yeah no I've
[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:31.480]  been listen listen it's people that haven't gone through this just don't
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:34.960]  know I mean I've had him call up tell me what I was talking about on the phone
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:38.400]  just so I know who it is and then threaten me I mean this country is just
[02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:47.480]  in a lot of trouble yeah I agree listen with the interview yesterday though with
[02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:55.160]  Megan Kelly I was pretty pretty upset because I was asked that you know some
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:46:59.040]  topics I wanted to go over and soon as I got there was just kind of bang bang boom
[02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:02.520]  she kind of didn't really give you a chance to you know discuss them well
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:05.840]  sure you've got that chance now you've got what are the points you want to make
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:10.840]  here well you know I like I said I'm no journalist and I don't know how to go
[02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:14.920]  about all this stuff but I mean I wrote I reached out with some Mercedes Ben and
[02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:18.840]  wrote an email and I don't know how often they're able to get something like
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:24.000]  this but I mean one of the things that you need to find out is how often in
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.560]  Russian Mercedes and on top of this let's remember Mercedes is one of the
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:32.880]  safest types of cars there especially nowadays that an engine you know comes
[02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:39.000]  out and looking at the fire from that I've been blown up in Iraq and Afghanistan
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:44.120]  and completely engulfed in flames but it never looked that bright I mean it
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:48.480]  never looked that big and I can tell you from first-hand experience from
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:53.400]  surviving you know IED explosions it was never at that magnitude that that car
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:47:59.480]  just you know fun family you know just to explode from hitting a tree yeah I've
[02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:05.400]  been told it looks like five to eight pounds of plastic explosive probably
[02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:11.440]  underneath the car right where he was sitting or in the dashboard and they
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:18.840]  debate whether it was 30 yards up to 50 yards or longer and another thing is
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:22.560]  I want to say that they saw sparks before the impact and then another person inside
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:27.760]  their house said that they it sounded like a bomb going off so you know cars
[02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:31.080]  hitting trees or something like bombs going off plus I've seen the photos
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:35.800]  sergeant staff sergeant it looks like they came to rest up against a tree the
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:40.400]  witnesses said it blew up in the street and jackknifed and then basically then
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:44.320]  was thrown into a tree yeah well that's what I think as well I was talking
[02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:48.080]  with my buddies earlier the way the engine's lying it had to have come out
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:52.000]  before even being near that tree I mean the car is not gonna hit a tree and then
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:55.280]  the engine it would have been some kind of mark where the engine had like
[02:48:55.280 --> 02:48:59.800]  ricocheted off the tree and gone in some direction instead of you know in the
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:04.720]  same direction of travel before you know that's right the car according to like
[02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:08.160]  three witnesses blows up in the street the engine flies out the front down the
[02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:12.600]  road then it comes to rest up against the tree if it hit on the side and the
[02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:17.680]  engine broke off which according to engineers they say they're so bolted to
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:21.120]  that frame it'd be incredibly hard to even break it loose it would have shot
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:24.800]  through the fence into the person's house not the opposite direction down the
[02:49:24.800 --> 02:49:30.360]  road yeah well we definitely need an independent expert investigation and I'd
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:34.320]  love to try to get a on the person to rest and have it examined by someone that'd
[02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:39.320]  be fantastic on all ends because I really don't trust the LAPD to be making
[02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:43.040]  some sound decisions on something like that I mean how do you rule out foul
[02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:48.800]  play in a matter of hours yeah absolutely sir and then Breitbart they
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:52.560]  announced he died of a heart attack 45 minutes after he was at the hospital that
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:55.960]  that's never done the corner wasn't even there and then the guy that did the
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:50:02.000]  coroner examination died of poisoning a month later I mean this is come on folks
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:07.040]  this this is getting insane and now now expanding on this when did you talk to
[02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:12.680]  his wife I mean was it at the funeral or via email was at the memorial or or via
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:18.760]  email where she said that I'm gonna take down whoever did this
[02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:23.280]  see when we're at the service you pull me aside and talk to me and she was like
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:27.640]  you know thanks for having you know base of the courage to do this and trying to
[02:50:27.640 --> 02:50:34.520]  help out she's like you know I'm definitely you know she's like I'm
[02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:38.240]  gonna do what I can to look into this with everything I got and you know the
[02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:41.080]  key was he did it she put her hand on me and she just gave me this look I mean
[02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:45.440]  it's a little like a pit bull you know like she was protecting the person she
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:50.080]  loves more than anything she's pissed off and it was the hardest thing for me to
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:55.840]  see just because you can see how bad it was pouring off and it was just it was
[02:50:55.840 --> 02:51:00.680]  a horrible this is me that you know that man was loved by so many people he was a
[02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:06.120]  great guy a lot of people hated him when that story with the crystal bro they
[02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:10.760]  hated him but I tell you right now for the soldier I got much respect for that
[02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:15.280]  man I respected the hell out of him he spoke the truth and he wasn't afraid to
[02:51:15.280 --> 02:51:19.320]  tell anybody that and they lied he'd call them out you know why all the fun is
[02:51:19.320 --> 02:51:24.600]  it wrong to be truthful and not pick up for sure right there was a gentleman went
[02:51:24.600 --> 02:51:30.080]  by the name Colonel six out of Dallas a African-American member of the military
[02:51:30.080 --> 02:51:32.880]  and he would send me all this great info and said my crystal's gonna go down
[02:51:32.880 --> 02:51:37.080]  soon and stuff and then about six months later he did and then Colonel six said
[02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:40.240]  I've got intel I'm gonna give you this is on record and then it was in the news
[02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:44.640]  the next week he committed suicide in Fort Worth and it turned out he was
[02:51:44.640 --> 02:51:49.560]  everybody he said he was Colonel six was his nickname and people can look up
[02:51:49.560 --> 02:51:52.560]  you guys full name and everything but it's just so many people and I'm not
[02:51:52.560 --> 02:51:55.880]  trying to scare people for the globalist I want people to understand
[02:51:55.880 --> 02:51:58.720]  though you've had a lot of military investigators killed and investigate
[02:51:58.720 --> 02:52:04.680]  missing money you know there's so many examples of this and we need to stand for
[02:52:04.680 --> 02:52:08.760]  the free press in the memory of Michael Hastings and I'll say this I didn't
[02:52:08.760 --> 02:52:12.480]  really know who he I mean I knew he was but I didn't know if I you know really
[02:52:12.480 --> 02:52:15.960]  respected him totally or not because I wasn't sure until I saw interviews he
[02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:19.920]  did about the NSA and saying we've got to come together you know the
[02:52:19.920 --> 02:52:23.200]  government's coming after us they're thugs this is illegal we've got to
[02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:27.640]  organize you know for for American freedom it was so powerful and then I
[02:52:27.640 --> 02:52:30.440]  saw other interviews and it seemed in the weeks because then I went back and
[02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:33.680]  watch more I wouldn't watch interviews from a year ago six months ago they
[02:52:33.680 --> 02:52:37.480]  weren't the same two weeks before he died he was doing interviews and was
[02:52:37.480 --> 02:52:42.800]  energized with like he discovered incredibly bad things and and I mean did
[02:52:42.800 --> 02:52:48.440]  you notice a change in him in those videos oh yeah definitely yeah when I
[02:52:48.440 --> 02:52:52.080]  was watching last night I could definitely see a fire under him he was
[02:52:52.080 --> 02:53:02.160]  definitely pretty motivated wouldn't you like to know what he discovered yeah I
[02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:07.880]  do I mean we've just got a like I said slow and steady wins the race this is
[02:53:07.880 --> 02:53:10.960]  something that's not going to be figured out immediately but I just got to have
[02:53:10.960 --> 02:53:15.200]  patience and I've reached out to people via Twitter and a lot of people have
[02:53:15.200 --> 02:53:19.440]  really come forward and been willing to help me I got a guy that lives in LA who's
[02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:24.400]  pretty much expert with the FOIAs he's already sent one of the FBI and the FBI
[02:53:24.400 --> 02:53:27.760]  has already sent back the letter and I he sent me a copy saying that they've
[02:53:27.760 --> 02:53:32.120]  received it and we'll be looking into it well listen all you've got to do is
[02:53:32.120 --> 02:53:39.520]  this you've got to start a defense fund on one of the crowd sourcing sites or
[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:47.640]  or just set up a paypal or something to get the basic money to go out there for
[02:53:47.640 --> 02:53:53.680]  like a month you get you get his wife to sign a power of attorney to let you get
[02:53:53.680 --> 02:53:57.960]  the car now here's the deal I shouldn't be announcing this on air they will try
[02:53:57.960 --> 02:54:01.760]  to scrub the car but if you get there and it's had chemicals extra chemical
[02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:05.600]  sprayed it's been scrubbed still you'll be able to find explosive residue you've
[02:54:05.600 --> 02:54:10.280]  got to get it to independent forensic people but here's the thing I got to
[02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:15.200]  warn you just like they killed the coroner of Breitbart I believe this was a
[02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:18.720]  car bombing the understanding you've been in combat so you're not a wimp I
[02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:21.680]  admire you and I admire mr. Hastings I don't know what I would do in the
[02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:26.440]  situation you they will probably try to off whoever goes to try to do samples of
[02:54:26.440 --> 02:54:31.240]  that car I'm telling you this is serious business just like TWA flight 800
[02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:35.200]  reporters snuck in and got the explosive residue that it was a US Air Force
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:38.720]  continuous rod warhead I had the top general on it blew the whistle general
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:42.240]  parton as well they arrested the reporters and put them in jail for a
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:45.800]  long time for breaking into the hangar so I'm just telling you this isn't a game
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:55.040]  and I know you know that I'm not making any kind of I believe this is what
[02:54:55.040 --> 02:55:00.280]  really happened right now like I said based off facts things don't add up
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:06.760]  right now so whether he'd be murdered or was an accident I can't rule out the
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:11.640]  worst that would be ending murder I can't rule that out because right now
[02:55:11.640 --> 02:55:18.000]  there's no factual proof to just prove that so you'd have to be insane to
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:21.800]  ignore all the things that happened all the ingredients
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:24.760]  there's gonna be there's gonna be so many people out there that they're just
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:28.480]  most people like you said or they don't they just breathe their news and they
[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:32.400]  just often go to work and they're happy and that's all there is you know and
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:35.840]  they go on about it and come back to their homes or pipes being in the white
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:39.360]  ticket fences and everything's all lollygags and happy and all that stuff
[02:55:39.360 --> 02:55:45.200]  but they don't realize it what people go through to really stick up for this
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:49.120]  country and things like that and there's a lot of people out there as well that
[02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:53.400]  are willing to do whatever they have to do to keep from their secrets down so
[02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:56.720]  absolutely well I can only respect your incredible courage sure I'd like to
[02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:00.640]  need to get you on as things unfold and if you need any help investigating this
[02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:04.320]  I'm if the family wants me to I'm willing to go to Los Angeles I mean I'm
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:08.880]  committed to this and I and if they kill me I want people to investigate what
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:13.040]  happened to Alex Jones just like you're doing for your buddy you know I believe
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:19.520]  that mr. Hastings is you know directly in heaven because God loves people that
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:24.120]  have courage and God hates cowards speaking if you could talk to Michael
[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:28.560]  right now Staff Sergeant Biggs what would you say to him
[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:34.400]  that he was it was amazing to see the amount of people that he expected to
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:39.080]  his life I just hope that one day that I'm able to have that much of an impact
[02:56:39.080 --> 02:56:45.320]  on people's lives as he did he was loved by many he was a fearless man he was one
[02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:51.000]  of the greatest people I've known and I have unwavering respect for this guy and
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:56.720]  like I told his friends and family is I'm not gonna sleep on this I'm committed
[02:56:56.720 --> 02:57:03.840]  and he should know that we're not gonna just sit back and roll over because I
[02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:08.120]  know if the roles are averse you do the same thing for me well Pat Gellman's
[02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:15.600]  brother push and they found out he was murdered we've got about a given up well

[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:22.880]  great people even of these wars of many of them are corrupt and wrong the people
[02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:26.880]  that are doing it you know got in for the right reasons and have just done
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:32.280]  things the average public has no idea how hard it is and and and mr. Hastings
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:36.320]  was in a war for freedom in this country and he said that and and I just want to
[02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:40.440]  commend you for what you're doing Staff Sergeant we got about a minute left

[03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:44.440]  Biggs during that little break at the end of the hour a briefing I wasn't trying
[03:00:44.440 --> 03:00:48.720]  to scare him and I could tell it was concerning him but I was telling him in
[03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:52.720]  the MO who they tend to use to blow people up in this country it's a mafia
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:58.800]  it's a sheep dipped army units and they've got the hostage rescue team as the
[03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:03.680]  cover for the FBI's black ops and they killed a couple of those guys who were
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:07.920]  in and around the Boston bombing and threw him out of a helicopter I mean
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:12.280]  this is this is this is not a game and that's why I told him point blank even
[03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:16.680]  though he's he's not you know he's been around the real world I was just
[03:01:16.680 --> 03:01:23.920]  telling him from my perspective this is what I know and a lot of it's been
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:28.960]  declassified a lot of it's been declassified but they have large hit
[03:01:28.960 --> 03:01:32.680]  teams in this country who are mainly killing drug dealers and people that
[03:01:32.680 --> 03:01:36.120]  don't launder the money through the right bank or you know and that's mainly
[03:01:36.120 --> 03:01:41.320]  what they do I wasn't trying to freak him out either I just was being honest
[03:01:41.320 --> 03:01:44.240]  with him and I said listen they're listening to your phone too I mean I
[03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:48.760]  just think people need to understand it's good to know this isn't a game this
[03:01:48.760 --> 03:01:55.120]  is real this is going on and if they blow me up or hang me or whatever it is
[03:01:55.120 --> 03:02:03.360]  baloney I don't even speed anymore I've been honest in the past I would have a
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:08.560]  little fun on an open highway I don't I drove home last night below the speed
[03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:14.440]  limit just because I got kids you know they're now I've had kids for years I
[03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:19.600]  just I just have gotten used to driving safe and so if I'm ever driving and
[03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:24.600]  they say a hundred mile an hour wreck I do not speed anymore I mean every once
[03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:29.200]  in a while I'll catch myself if it's a 70 mile an hour I'll catch myself going
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:34.200]  75 or something but I mean people was pretty fast at 70 or 75 I guess I'm
[03:02:34.200 --> 03:02:37.360]  just getting old or something turn drive like a grandma actually one of my
[03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:43.360]  grandmothers drove like a bat out of hell one that died me mom Patty but the
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:49.480]  point is is that if there's a high speed car wreck I don't speed anymore it's
[03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:58.120]  almost pointless to have a charger I don't I don't use drugs other than
[03:02:58.120 --> 03:03:04.040]  occasional beer glass of wine and a cigar and I mean last tobacco I had was
[03:03:04.040 --> 03:03:08.600]  when I smoked a pipe on air to point out that some pipes are illegal in Florida
[03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:17.920]  now so I don't do illegal drugs I don't I don't do prescription drugs I don't
[03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:24.120]  speed I don't they love to kill a hooker and kill you and throw you in bed with
[03:03:24.120 --> 03:03:27.440]  them that's one of their favorite things or drug you and then put you in bed with
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:30.720]  a dead hooker that's one of their favorite tactics that ever happens I
[03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:34.520]  don't do that that's a lie there's a lot of ways they can kill me or if I have a
[03:03:34.520 --> 03:03:38.280]  heart attack and they go oh he was overweight folks if I'm I'm wearing
[03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:41.120]  underwear folks I don't look like I'm under overweight when I'm been over I've
[03:03:41.120 --> 03:03:45.960]  got somewhat of a belly because I've got a long torso I can swim five miles if I
[03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:50.340]  had time I'm from two miles I'm be tired I can go hike up a eight mile you
[03:03:50.340 --> 03:03:54.840]  know mountain and do it again you know hours later I can you know jog three
[03:03:54.840 --> 03:03:58.240]  miles no problem I'm not in great shape but I've had my blood pressure checked
[03:03:58.240 --> 03:04:05.040]  everything my heart's in great shape I mean I'm in great shape and so if I have
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:10.120]  a heart attack I'm 39 years old it's you know they killed me I don't have any

[03:04:36.360 --> 03:04:40.640]  could tell it was about me now I could tell he really liked Michael and it's

[03:09:38.920 --> 03:09:43.880]  tragedyandhope.com freemindfilms.com is the main site for their films I'm the
[03:09:43.880 --> 03:09:47.880]  exclusive distributor in the first three months or so of state of mind that when
[03:09:47.880 --> 03:09:51.040]  I saw it I just said well I'm gonna get behind this I'm in it got a bunch of
[03:09:51.040 --> 03:09:54.240]  people in it we're gonna talk about this film and pre-order it now it ships on

[03:10:09.520 --> 03:10:17.320]  do that it's gonna premiere on the 17th of July that Wednesday here coming up
[03:10:17.320 --> 03:10:22.320]  next month but it's a very important to support independent filmmaking it's very
[03:10:22.320 --> 03:10:26.000]  important to wake your friends and family up believe me this is a very
[03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:29.480]  professional film I'm very honored to be part of it it's even better because you
[03:10:29.480 --> 03:10:34.360]  get better as a filmmakers than their noble lie that was a premiere film that
[03:10:34.360 --> 03:10:37.320]  was better than probably what I could do in many cases so they're just just just
[03:10:37.320 --> 03:10:41.720]  just really doing an incredible job with the rest of their team and you can get
[03:10:41.720 --> 03:10:46.720]  the film at state of mind the psychology of control and until it sells out which
[03:10:46.720 --> 03:10:51.800]  should be any day now this is the first 5,000 orders you can get free the
[03:10:51.800 --> 03:10:54.720]  animated film on the history of the Federal Reserve it's very entertaining
[03:10:54.720 --> 03:10:59.880]  great to wake people up the American dream we'll have to take that down the
[03:10:59.880 --> 03:11:05.120]  next few days because we're getting very close to 5,000 of these being sold so
[03:11:05.120 --> 03:11:11.200]  take advantage of that them for store.com or by calling 888-253-3139 I
[03:11:11.200 --> 03:11:14.720]  may be able to get a better deal and get more of these and bring the special
[03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:20.400]  back but we got a really good deal on these 10,000 of these but we sold 5,000
[03:11:20.400 --> 03:11:24.840]  of them and have 5,000 left and I said well let's just offer that it's such an
[03:11:24.840 --> 03:11:28.160]  important film and we got a really good deal on it so I said let's just offer it
[03:11:28.160 --> 03:11:32.480]  free that's what I do when I get stuff really low priced then I just give it to
[03:11:32.480 --> 03:11:37.040]  you because my goal is all about waking people up that's why the new magazines
[03:11:37.040 --> 03:11:42.360]  out has 10 free bumper stickers in the July issue that's because I want to
[03:11:42.360 --> 03:11:45.760]  wake people up I want to defeat the new world order I'm risking my life doing
[03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:49.440]  this because I studied history I want to make a difference I want to empower
[03:11:49.440 --> 03:11:53.360]  people men and women that stand up for justice are what have made everything in
[03:11:53.360 --> 03:11:57.720]  our world good that's good and there's always that struggle now I was talking
[03:11:57.720 --> 03:12:01.680]  to James Lane the founding of free Minds Films and the director of a noble
[03:12:01.680 --> 03:12:07.040]  lie Oklahoma City 95 and the psychology of control this mission is to alter the
[03:12:07.040 --> 03:12:11.320]  information paradigm with hard-hitting exposés of state crimes and cover-ups
[03:12:11.320 --> 03:12:17.160]  and Richard Grove filed for federal whistleblower protection under the
[03:12:17.160 --> 03:12:21.000]  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 02 and we're gonna get into that because that ties into the
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:26.200]  NSA and everything that's happening right now and he's just done a whole bunch
[03:12:26.200 --> 03:12:28.480]  of work I'm not gonna get into this whole bio you can find out more at
[03:12:28.480 --> 03:12:32.960]  tragedyandhope.com but I've mentioned this when I start thinking what you said
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:38.640]  before you went live here James whenever I start thinking about all the people I
[03:12:38.640 --> 03:12:43.640]  know that have been murdered and in many cases when it's on record they've been
[03:12:43.640 --> 03:12:47.200]  murdered nobody knows who and in cop of the year Terrence Yeke and you've
[03:12:47.200 --> 03:12:50.440]  interviewed his family you know they're in the noble life film he said the feds
[03:12:50.440 --> 03:12:53.640]  are after me to his partner they pull him over they torture him shoot him in
[03:12:53.640 --> 03:12:59.440]  the back of the head then you interview the cop Browning the head of the canine
[03:12:59.440 --> 03:13:03.240]  unit that I've had on the show naming FBI that walked in and said you and your
[03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:07.760]  wife were dead if you don't shut up I mean I know the real world and I know
[03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:12.360]  that it's a mafia that runs this and the parallels of Terrence Yeke cop of the
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:17.480]  year and MC and the feds involved in the bombing first person respond and what
[03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:22.080]  happened to Michael Hastings I mean look at my gut they killed him James Lane
[03:13:22.080 --> 03:13:26.600]  talking about that and interjecting with Oklahoma City and the mind control of
[03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:31.080]  how we just oh our government's the good guys it's tinfoil hat they might kill
[03:13:31.080 --> 03:13:35.080]  somebody when it's on record they've done this over and over again and then I
[03:13:35.080 --> 03:13:38.640]  want to get a Richard Groves take on this and tie it into his whole whistle
[03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:42.400]  blower case so gentlemen good to have you here thank you for having us on Alex yeah
[03:13:42.400 --> 03:13:44.560]  when I've heard about the Michael Hastings case that was the first thing
[03:13:44.560 --> 03:13:48.000]  you know that well when the information broke that the other feds were
[03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:51.720]  following him that's first thing I think of is Terrence Yeke and a lot of people
[03:13:51.720 --> 03:13:55.360]  would ask us you know it's 17 years on why are you still investigating the
[03:13:55.360 --> 03:13:58.440]  Oklahoma City bombing why does it matter well because look at this and if we
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:02.200]  we don't expose these we don't show people this continues to happen this is
[03:14:02.200 --> 03:14:05.440]  still a methodology that they will use over and over again you know with Terry
[03:14:05.440 --> 03:14:09.960]  he's he was trying to take some documents to some storage and he said
[03:14:09.960 --> 03:14:12.640]  that the feds were following him and that's where they find him deadly said
[03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:16.480]  I got to go the feds are on my tail yeah and you know they declared his death
[03:14:16.480 --> 03:14:20.680]  a suicide you know and it was very obvious that it wasn't I mean he had
[03:14:20.680 --> 03:14:26.040]  the lacerations was Vince Foster so he had was shot to the top of the head at a
[03:14:26.040 --> 03:14:30.720]  far enough distance that it didn't leave powder residue etc. and they got back
[03:14:30.720 --> 03:14:33.880]  when they did it yeah right and this was still whenever the the official story
[03:14:33.880 --> 03:14:37.320]  was real formulating in the public mind and so they couldn't allow any
[03:14:37.320 --> 03:14:40.400]  information to come out at that time it seems like you know well after the
[03:14:40.400 --> 03:14:44.200]  operation has occurred you know that's okay but you know how mad do you think
[03:14:44.200 --> 03:14:47.360]  they are that our reporters took over all those Boston bombing press conferences
[03:14:47.360 --> 03:14:51.240]  you know they shot the guy that knew that the Patsy brothers in the top of
[03:14:51.240 --> 03:14:55.360]  the head too yeah well yeah I mean that's getting in on the front end of it
[03:14:55.360 --> 03:14:58.160]  this is where you know we were trying to expose this stuff if they're gonna kill
[03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:01.800]  me for anything I think it's that I mean I well this is why you're so so
[03:15:01.800 --> 03:15:06.120]  important I mean who else is putting this information out you know so yeah I'm
[03:15:06.120 --> 03:15:10.720]  just I don't mean to obsess on it it's just I my gut feels the danger level I
[03:15:10.720 --> 03:15:14.200]  feel the angel of death flapping around I mean I've you know it's yeah but what
[03:15:14.200 --> 03:15:17.880]  kind of interesting huh what Terry he said you know when the official story
[03:15:17.880 --> 03:15:20.400]  was starting unravel he said that's not the way it happened you know it's very
[03:15:20.400 --> 03:15:24.840]  distraught over that and you know when they said his family's asking questions
[03:15:24.840 --> 03:15:28.880]  they're like oh you're paranoid you watch too much TV and you know it's all
[03:15:28.880 --> 03:15:32.400]  about what about Browning they come in his office twice they were gonna kill you
[03:15:32.400 --> 03:15:35.800]  and your wife yeah yeah basically said people that asked questions like you
[03:15:35.800 --> 03:15:40.240]  they end up dead no them and their wife end up dead FBI agent saying that to him
[03:15:40.240 --> 03:15:45.120]  you know he knew that was a threat you know it's just a blatant threat and
[03:15:45.120 --> 03:15:48.800]  he said again by the water cooler too yeah it's about intimidation you know
[03:15:48.800 --> 03:15:51.440]  and just trying to squash the information I gotta be honest I mean
[03:15:51.440 --> 03:15:54.800]  somebody said that to me I'd have a lot of trouble not you know punch them right
[03:15:54.800 --> 03:15:58.720]  in the nose but that's how cowardly America's gotten Donna's incredible
[03:15:58.720 --> 03:16:01.640]  courage to go public I'm just saying everybody just grovels to the government
[03:16:01.640 --> 03:16:04.840]  oh threaten to kill me that's wonderful well this is part of why we wanted to
[03:16:04.840 --> 03:16:09.320]  make state of mind is because once the Noble I came out we were asking why
[03:16:09.320 --> 03:16:12.920]  don't more people question these events you know and so we really want to look
[03:16:12.920 --> 03:16:17.680]  at the mechanism that put people into you know conditioning and in under a
[03:16:17.680 --> 03:16:21.720]  level of control where they don't question where they just you know accept
[03:16:21.720 --> 03:16:26.640]  authority without without question and so we really wanted to break down the
[03:16:26.640 --> 03:16:31.680]  methodology of how it's done not just the the talk about mind control people in
[03:16:31.680 --> 03:16:34.920]  national security because I've talked to so many of them friends family others
[03:16:34.920 --> 03:16:38.800]  they're told you ever don't do what we say we're gonna kill you and it's this
[03:16:38.800 --> 03:16:43.080]  attitude if they're allowed to kill us I mean it's just it's it's amazing
[03:16:43.080 --> 03:16:46.120]  oh it's really great or good you know it's like yeah sometimes they might have
[03:16:46.120 --> 03:16:49.520]  to kill Americans it's you know and we don't need to know about it because you
[03:16:49.520 --> 03:16:52.160]  know the government knows best you know in that whole mindset where did that
[03:16:52.160 --> 03:16:55.640]  where did that really solidify in in people's minds you know we find that in
[03:16:55.640 --> 03:16:58.960]  public education there was this is really where it starts it's not about
[03:16:58.960 --> 03:17:03.000]  learning to think critically using logic and reason I mean I did the program
[03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:06.360]  myself after I got out of school and teach myself how to think because it was
[03:17:06.360 --> 03:17:10.160]  all about accepting authority and regurgitating useless facts so you become
[03:17:10.160 --> 03:17:16.320]  a cog in the machine tell us about your experience as a whistleblower my
[03:17:16.320 --> 03:17:20.160]  experience as a whistleblower started out being a naive corporate worker so I'm
[03:17:20.160 --> 03:17:24.440]  there just trying to you know live up to the standards that I was brought up with
[03:17:24.440 --> 03:17:28.600]  through American culture and then when you get into you know the workplace and
[03:17:28.600 --> 03:17:31.800]  you're surrounded by people who might not have the same values because I come
[03:17:31.800 --> 03:17:34.240]  from the Midwest we have a different set of values and people in New York City
[03:17:34.240 --> 03:17:37.400]  when you see things that are unseemly when you see things that are illegal and
[03:17:37.400 --> 03:17:39.960]  you blow the whistle under protection you expect protection from your
[03:17:39.960 --> 03:17:44.080]  corporation not a standard operating procedure to fire you to terminate you
[03:17:44.080 --> 03:17:47.800]  and so you know going to court I thought well I'm gonna get justification I'm
[03:17:47.800 --> 03:17:50.600]  gonna present evidence going to the media I thought maybe they would cover
[03:17:50.600 --> 03:17:54.200]  the story and after proving everything in court and going to people like Lowell
[03:17:54.200 --> 03:17:57.280]  Bergman who said yeah this is there's valid information here but we can't
[03:17:57.280 --> 03:18:01.320]  cover it and so then I just started to discover alternative media to go out and
[03:18:01.320 --> 03:18:04.840]  look beyond what I was being force-fed through the Wall Street Journal or you
[03:18:04.840 --> 03:18:08.560]  know USA Today is what they give you at the hotel right and I started reading
[03:18:08.560 --> 03:18:11.600]  into things like foreign affairs where you can see you know these people have a
[03:18:11.600 --> 03:18:15.040]  transnationalist agenda they're here to collectivize America they're here to
[03:18:15.040 --> 03:18:18.240]  undermine our education and they do it also they reinforce it through TV and
[03:18:18.240 --> 03:18:21.120]  corporate media and so they're breaking down the self-reliant self-esteem
[03:18:21.120 --> 03:18:25.080]  self-confidence of Americans to make us spineless and that's reinforced as you've
[03:18:25.080 --> 03:18:28.920]  noticed many times or observed on your show the father figure in sitcoms
[03:18:28.920 --> 03:18:32.560]  spineless individual is being run into the ground can't solve problems by
[03:18:32.560 --> 03:18:35.480]  themselves and so by taking away the intellectual tools of how to learn
[03:18:35.480 --> 03:18:40.400]  anything for ourselves they've made us very very dependent on authority I got
[03:18:40.400 --> 03:18:44.240]  to get this guy more often yeah we were really lucky to get him to come on board
[03:18:44.240 --> 03:18:47.600]  as the head researcher and writer for yeah I didn't go over your whole bio tell
[03:18:47.600 --> 03:18:52.200]  folks a little bit more about yourself well let's see after finding out that
[03:18:52.200 --> 03:18:55.760]  corporate media was kind of debunked and it's on its way out because they no
[03:18:55.760 --> 03:19:02.400]  longer have investigative journalists or budgets you're good then you start to
[03:19:02.400 --> 03:19:06.800]  notice these press conferences actually you're good on a minute right it's on
[03:19:06.800 --> 03:19:10.600]  you now and you start to notice the press the contradictions you start to
[03:19:10.600 --> 03:19:13.640]  pick up on the contradictions you start to dig into it and what I thought you
[03:19:13.640 --> 03:19:16.480]  know when I first was still wearing a suit at corporate corporate world every
[03:19:16.480 --> 03:19:21.400]  day was that well this will just pass this get this network right guys go can
[03:19:21.400 --> 03:19:23.640]  keep going this is just something that you see on the internet that has no
[03:19:23.640 --> 03:19:26.920]  credibility but when I dug into books like Carol Quigley's Tragedy and Hope
[03:19:26.920 --> 03:19:30.080]  or the Anglo-American establishment or John Taylor Gatto's the underground
[03:19:30.080 --> 03:19:33.000]  history of American it's just all admitted scientific dictatorship is
[03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:36.320]  chapter 9 in Gatto's book and it explains clearly Bertrand Russell and these
[03:19:36.320 --> 03:19:40.200]  other transhumanists transnationalists you know all these different agendas that
[03:19:40.200 --> 03:19:43.640]  you cover on your show they all have commonality this is a finite planet the
[03:19:43.640 --> 03:19:48.000]  globalists are a finite group of people and Hastings or Jeannie Palfrey or Gary
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:51.800]  Webb or any of these other investigative journalists or people who have had
[03:19:51.800 --> 03:19:56.200]  stories that you know needed coverage they have to come here because luckily we
[03:19:56.200 --> 03:19:59.600]  have a place someplace on this planet that does have the budget to get these
[03:19:59.600 --> 03:20:02.720]  big interviews I don't have the ability to do this myself I couldn't interview
[03:20:02.720 --> 03:20:06.400]  Sergeant Joe Bakes today and break that story so I'm grateful that there are
[03:20:06.400 --> 03:20:09.520]  people out there that are you know aiding you and assisting you because I've
[03:20:09.520 --> 03:20:14.120]  seen you struggle over the years and well I'm trying I'm trying to get other
[03:20:14.120 --> 03:20:17.680]  that's why I try to support other media outlets so that we're not one of the
[03:20:17.680 --> 03:20:21.240]  only ones doing it because I just want to win this thing it's not about being a
[03:20:21.240 --> 03:20:25.360]  big media guy I mean if I'm successful they'll probably take me out somehow you
[03:20:25.360 --> 03:20:30.160]  know not physically politically so my mission is almost like a mushroom to get
[03:20:30.160 --> 03:20:33.880]  my spores out there so that there's a million mushrooms so they can never wipe
[03:20:33.880 --> 03:20:37.120]  us all out that's why I've got the reporters that's why I'm trying to
[03:20:37.120 --> 03:20:41.880]  build an organization so even if they get me it continues because then that
[03:20:41.880 --> 03:20:44.760]  makes killing me obsolete I mean this is the type of thoughts we have to have
[03:20:44.760 --> 03:20:47.800]  around here well it's worked because I mean this was the inspiration for me to
[03:20:47.800 --> 03:20:50.920]  start free mind films was I wanted to be able to participate in this and
[03:20:50.920 --> 03:20:55.360]  create tools because we have our roots in street street activism so I want to be
[03:20:55.360 --> 03:20:58.200]  able to give people tools that they can take to their friends and family that
[03:20:58.200 --> 03:21:03.080]  uninitiated and presenting in a way where you know it's acceptable to them
[03:21:03.080 --> 03:21:08.240]  you know it's like it it's not just for the choir we want this to show to the
[03:21:08.240 --> 03:21:13.080]  uninitiated where you can really give them a foundational understanding of you
[03:21:13.080 --> 03:21:16.720]  know the control and then maybe be able to escape it and then just start look at
[03:21:16.720 --> 03:21:21.040]  the bigger pictures you know state of mind is kind of a starting point so it
[03:21:21.040 --> 03:21:23.520]  gives you the tools to communicate with your friends and family and co-workers
[03:21:23.520 --> 03:21:28.360]  in a credible and desirable way and it also is backed by a lot of research where
[03:21:28.360 --> 03:21:32.360]  we're able to bring you in depth so for the choir there's something else and
[03:21:32.360 --> 03:21:36.200]  for the congregation it's something meaty so you have this additional
[03:21:36.200 --> 03:21:40.240]  information that is available if you want to dig in past the film and see
[03:21:40.240 --> 03:21:44.640]  about any of these underlying agendas of MK ultra or eugenics or any of these
[03:21:44.640 --> 03:21:48.000]  other things that are covered in its depth and entirety with references tell
[03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:53.840]  folks who all is in the film well we have Jere Griffin we have Anthony Schaefer
[03:21:53.840 --> 03:21:58.280]  he was specifically talking about some of the the psyops you know kind of
[03:21:58.280 --> 03:22:02.960]  breaking those down with his experience in the military intelligence we've got
[03:22:02.960 --> 03:22:12.020]  several psychologists we've got Colin Ross we've got John Rappaport Bruce
[03:22:12.020 --> 03:22:16.000]  Levine Bruce Levine Bruce Levine I actually found him through one of the
[03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:20.680]  shows that you did on a prison planet and the guy it really comes up with
[03:22:20.680 --> 03:22:25.120]  solutions it's not you know it's not just pointing it out he comes up with
[03:22:25.120 --> 03:22:29.360]  ideas a great psychologist and get it would get up stand up I think was his
[03:22:29.360 --> 03:22:35.040]  book it was it was very inspirational we've got Charlotte Iserbeet you know
[03:22:35.040 --> 03:22:41.920]  Kay Beach great activists yourself so really good line of a people a real
[03:22:41.920 --> 03:22:45.000]  broad spectrum and to get the psychologists in there a man they've got
[03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:48.880]  a way of just getting right to the heart of the matter you know be it you know
[03:22:48.880 --> 03:22:55.080]  pharmacological control of society or you know the coming up with disorders
[03:22:55.080 --> 03:22:58.920]  like anti-authoritarian personality disorder and all these types of things
[03:22:58.920 --> 03:23:03.120]  which should be good doesn't want to be a slave disorder yeah yeah and so we're
[03:23:03.120 --> 03:23:06.520]  we were really pleased with the lineup I think I think these these folks really
[03:23:06.520 --> 03:23:09.960]  get the message across well the film is available at infowarstore.com
[03:23:09.960 --> 03:23:14.520]  state of mind the psychology of control and it's so important to get the film
[03:23:14.520 --> 03:23:17.080]  so that you are informed of higher levels you can wake up your friends and
[03:23:17.080 --> 03:23:20.560]  family but also to support these filmmakers what we're doing you vote
[03:23:20.560 --> 03:23:24.480]  with your dollars we're not like MSNBC and others that get taxpayer funds we
[03:23:24.480 --> 03:23:27.720]  don't get Rockefeller Foundation funds we are supported by viewers and listeners
[03:23:27.720 --> 03:23:32.640]  out there like you and we also have it on Blu-ray because I said hey you know
[03:23:32.640 --> 03:23:37.040]  we're gonna put this out on DVD you know I paid to put some Blu-rays out as
[03:23:37.040 --> 03:23:41.800]  well because Obama deception too is gonna be out on Blu-ray you know the whole
[03:23:41.800 --> 03:23:46.200]  issue here is it's good to have a hard copy of things like this as well we
[03:23:46.200 --> 03:23:51.960]  will premiere it on info wars nightly news of the 17th as it's already being
[03:23:51.960 --> 03:23:54.640]  shipped out everybody that buys a hard copy then obviously that will be
[03:23:54.640 --> 03:23:59.360]  available to people out of the gates a film for everybody to be able to see
[03:23:59.360 --> 03:24:02.400]  free after it's been on present money dot TV we have to understand something
[03:24:02.400 --> 03:24:07.160]  that's because they want to get the information out to people and if they
[03:24:07.160 --> 03:24:12.000]  don't sell enough to make their money back there won't be any more films so
[03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:17.080]  we're we're right at the level at current sales that may be within three
[03:24:17.080 --> 03:24:20.480]  four months because that's really the you know the main life of a film that
[03:24:20.480 --> 03:24:24.560]  tapers off to try to even make their money back so for heaven's sakes folks
[03:24:24.560 --> 03:24:27.400]  we're up here risking our lives you guys definitely risk your lives in the
[03:24:27.400 --> 03:24:31.440]  Oklahoma City film people they kill a lot of people over that so we're here
[03:24:31.440 --> 03:24:34.440]  risking our lives you need to buy the film and people out there should buy
[03:24:34.440 --> 03:24:37.240]  five copies to give it to friends and family people should be get prison
[03:24:37.240 --> 03:24:41.120]  planted on TV memberships and and you know you should you know after
[03:24:41.120 --> 03:24:44.060]  premieres live that night you know during the live show them are gonna go to
[03:24:44.060 --> 03:24:49.680]  tape and play the film you should use your prison planet on TV membership you
[03:24:49.680 --> 03:24:52.440]  know the next day when you have the high-quality download of it off the site
[03:24:52.440 --> 03:24:57.040]  to have your friends and family come over you know maybe the 18th and or watch
[03:24:57.040 --> 03:25:02.840]  it live stream that night you the whole point is is that it's now time to go out
[03:25:02.840 --> 03:25:09.160]  and proselytize for liberty to other people I want us to beat this evil and
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:13.600]  we've got to become aware of the evil if we have any chance of doing it and and
[03:25:13.600 --> 03:25:16.120]  what do you guys think is happening is you're both really smart guys I've heard
[03:25:16.120 --> 03:25:18.640]  your radio shows you know over the years why I feel like I know you're so good
[03:25:18.640 --> 03:25:22.320]  even though we've only met a few times in the past when you're making films why
[03:25:22.320 --> 03:25:26.440]  do you think they're racing ahead right now and why do you think the agenda is
[03:25:26.440 --> 03:25:29.960]  coming out in the open as people are spinning it saying you know Snowden
[03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:34.240]  must be an agent and blah blah blah but I've experienced every time I do
[03:25:34.240 --> 03:25:39.760]  something I know I'm not an agent I know I'm real and they say oh he must be an
[03:25:39.760 --> 03:25:44.880]  insider you know because of the fact that he's been successful it's almost like
[03:25:44.880 --> 03:25:48.600]  this idea that no one can be successful but evil people when that's not true
[03:25:48.600 --> 03:25:53.560]  that's what's so frustrating so so what do you think's happening in the state of
[03:25:53.560 --> 03:25:56.920]  the battle right now we were talking about this just before the show it's
[03:25:56.920 --> 03:26:00.600]  it's like you know trying to hold a ball underwater it's natural status to pop
[03:26:00.600 --> 03:26:04.200]  out and they have a ball yeah we have they are inserting so much to control to
[03:26:04.200 --> 03:26:07.600]  keep it under water and these types of efforts is inflate the ball
[03:26:07.600 --> 03:26:11.080]  Brzezinski said his greatest fear is a massive global awakening of consciousness
[03:26:11.080 --> 03:26:13.640]  and that's what they're seeing right now they're seeing the internet used and
[03:26:13.640 --> 03:26:16.800]  social networks used in a way that they never imagined they wanted to data mine
[03:26:16.800 --> 03:26:20.160]  us to use artificial intelligence to chew on that data mining to provide
[03:26:20.160 --> 03:26:23.320]  profiles to predict our behavior and control us like human resource and now
[03:26:23.320 --> 03:26:26.720]  they're predicting their defeat yeah absolutely and so people are waking up
[03:26:26.720 --> 03:26:29.840]  faster and faster and a massive global awakening of consciousness is stimulated
[03:26:29.840 --> 03:26:32.880]  by independent media we are the ones waking people up everyone who does
[03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:36.160]  something on their own without being told by an authority to do it or a big
[03:26:36.160 --> 03:26:39.800]  corporation paying you to do it thinking on our own using our creativity and
[03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:43.800]  imagination that which corporate society and education wants to snuff out by
[03:26:43.800 --> 03:26:47.640]  reigniting those flames of liberty then evil doesn't have to happen because good
[03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:51.520]  people do nothing good people know how to do something and get it done and all
[03:26:51.520 --> 03:26:55.200]  it takes is to get involved just one one step leads to the next you know I mean a
[03:26:55.200 --> 03:26:58.000]  lot of this starts out with just local activism or like you said take the
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:01.640]  bumper stickers you know put the car give these give the man big things have
[03:27:01.640 --> 03:27:06.640]  small beginnings what did you make of of Staff Sergeant Big's on saying I've just
[03:27:06.640 --> 03:27:10.920]  got to stand up I can't be a coward my gut tells me this is bad it doesn't add
[03:27:10.920 --> 03:27:15.480]  up and and now others will stand up and then they'll crush people when I found
[03:27:15.480 --> 03:27:19.240]  is when they crush whistleblowers it scares the cowards they're already
[03:27:19.240 --> 03:27:23.520]  cowards but it makes the real men and women actually fight harder I see them
[03:27:23.520 --> 03:27:28.000]  having to kill a bunch of people as the beginning of the end it'll be a last
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:31.520]  desperate act I mean I think that you know we see that we're getting close to
[03:27:31.520 --> 03:27:34.520]  a critical mass I mean it's everything's out in the open I mean some of the
[03:27:34.520 --> 03:27:37.880]  t-shirts I'm wearing stuff I just you know random people will come up and start
[03:27:37.880 --> 03:27:41.400]  talking about the NSA you know coming out saying you know that they're
[03:27:41.400 --> 03:27:44.400]  monitoring everybody it's like well you know everybody's talking about this you
[03:27:44.400 --> 03:27:48.840]  know 96 97 with echelon and carnivore it was like well now it's just out in the
[03:27:48.840 --> 03:27:53.080]  open and so much has come out again you said you know that social media we're
[03:27:53.080 --> 03:27:56.120]  taking their tools and using them again and everybody remembers that they made
[03:27:56.120 --> 03:28:00.000]  fun of us instead we were crazy liars and then exactly what we told them came
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:04.080]  came true because it was already there no it didn't come true they just took the
[03:28:04.080 --> 03:28:08.200]  blinders off it was what but they have business plans and if you read these
[03:28:08.200 --> 03:28:11.120]  business plans you can understand their agenda no that's it they have business
[03:28:11.120 --> 03:28:14.320]  plans exactly and they're intellectually bankrupt their rational they use force
[03:28:14.320 --> 03:28:17.440]  fraud and coercion to attain their goals that's another thing I've studied these
[03:28:17.440 --> 03:28:21.080]  elitists they have the most unhappy families that their kids are all
[03:28:21.080 --> 03:28:25.360]  committing suicide I mean it's not good for them either right I mean it's not
[03:28:25.360 --> 03:28:30.200]  good to screw everybody over it's gonna come back on you yeah and well and I
[03:28:30.200 --> 03:28:34.040]  mean they're they're they're pure ego they're pure just will and they're that's why I think why
[03:28:34.040 --> 03:28:37.600]  that there's so much in fighting me with it within their own ranks you know thank
[03:28:37.600 --> 03:28:42.000]  God yes well one of the other things we've lost in this country is integrity as
[03:28:42.000 --> 03:28:45.160]  a core value when people in this country say they value truth the people who
[03:28:45.160 --> 03:28:49.680]  remind most valuable possession is my integrity right I mean I really enjoy
[03:28:49.680 --> 03:28:53.320]  it's not just like I'm a goody-to-shoes I feel good knowing that I really am a
[03:28:53.320 --> 03:28:56.800]  good guy that's why they always try to say I'm not good because the system knows
[03:28:56.800 --> 03:29:00.160]  they know that they don't want you to think there's other good people well
[03:29:00.160 --> 03:29:02.760]  integrity is doing what you said you were gonna do when you said you were
[03:29:02.760 --> 03:29:05.680]  gonna do it and it's about that consistency that your friends and family
[03:29:05.680 --> 03:29:09.160]  can trust you and co-workers and so that our whole society is based on trust and
[03:29:09.160 --> 03:29:12.880]  JP Morgan said at one point the entire banking system is made on trust and
[03:29:12.880 --> 03:29:15.880]  they've broken that trust they've broken that trust they've abused their system
[03:29:15.880 --> 03:29:18.240]  and that's what's causing people to wake up and they're not gonna go back to
[03:29:18.240 --> 03:29:22.040]  sleep because there's only more and more and more substance to find well man
[03:29:22.040 --> 03:29:26.200]  awesome let's come back and do another segment or two great job with the crew in

[03:29:41.440 --> 03:29:44.680]  something going on and have the urge and the motivation to make a phone call and
[03:29:44.680 --> 03:29:47.720]  spread that information and go against the mind control right all the peer

[03:33:07.280 --> 03:33:13.360]  Alex Jones here back live by the way here's a Herald Sun article Hastings
[03:33:13.360 --> 03:33:16.840]  previously revealed he'd been subjected to death threats during his
[03:33:16.840 --> 03:33:20.400]  investigation of general mccrystal saying it was commonplace in his line of
[03:33:20.400 --> 03:33:25.880]  work wherever I'd been reporting around groups of dudes whose job it was to kill
[03:33:25.880 --> 03:33:32.200]  people one of them would usually mention that they were going to kill me and it's
[03:33:32.200 --> 03:33:39.360]  not a joke ladies and gentlemen we have a degenerate ruling class of corporate
[03:33:39.360 --> 03:33:44.080]  anti-liberty fascists using disgusting socialism and the grassroots to create a
[03:33:44.080 --> 03:33:49.080]  bunch of sycophantic lazy delts to be used as political weapons to pull down
[03:33:49.080 --> 03:33:55.440]  society I mean every message you see out there is anti-family anti this anti that
[03:33:55.440 --> 03:33:59.160]  and all the fake equality moves you see promoted are not about real equality
[03:33:59.160 --> 03:34:02.680]  it's about the federal government manipulating groups of people against
[03:34:02.680 --> 03:34:08.760]  each other and it is unbelievable but but there's the Herald Sun and and I'd
[03:34:08.760 --> 03:34:12.640]  forgotten because I remember reading this about a year ago that he was being
[03:34:12.640 --> 03:34:17.480]  death-threaded and then his buddy mentioned it and then it was the weirdest
[03:34:17.480 --> 03:34:20.400]  thing I wasn't even searching it I already had an article up there about
[03:34:20.400 --> 03:34:24.760]  reporter Michael Hastings shit panicky email and then I just looked as he was
[03:34:24.760 --> 03:34:31.160]  talking to me and there was the Herald Sun with it saying it while he's talking
[03:34:31.160 --> 03:34:36.280]  about it I'd seen that nowhere on the news and the article I had up said it
[03:34:36.280 --> 03:34:40.760]  from two days ago I mean it's just it's it's hiding in plain view and his wife
[03:34:40.760 --> 03:34:44.080]  comes out and says we're gonna find out who did this we're gonna take down
[03:34:44.080 --> 03:34:48.560]  whoever did this and I'm telling you know he said off air to me that she was
[03:34:48.560 --> 03:34:52.200]  busy should have got this on air you know in grief right now he may have said
[03:34:52.200 --> 03:34:56.640]  on air at all mixes together but she better either decide to pack it up and
[03:34:56.640 --> 03:35:03.600]  shut up and that's still a dangerous course or go totally public now that's
[03:35:03.600 --> 03:35:08.600]  probably the safest course the I mean it's it's it's not very safe to just
[03:35:08.600 --> 03:35:12.480]  say I'm gonna shut up cuz they know that she may go public later and look at
[03:35:12.480 --> 03:35:16.920]  the they'll kill her I mean they'll kill everybody because I've been talking about
[03:35:16.920 --> 03:35:20.240]  this for two weeks since it came out in the New York Times it just reminded me
[03:35:20.240 --> 03:35:23.480]  that hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops got nerve-gassed even USA Day
[03:35:23.480 --> 03:35:26.400]  admitted it our government ordered the stuff blown up knew the wind was
[03:35:26.400 --> 03:35:30.240]  blowing right into Kuwait let him huff it said take your mask off just like the
[03:35:30.240 --> 03:35:33.920]  World Trade Center collapsed cuz they didn't want to admit it was hurting them
[03:35:33.920 --> 03:35:37.920]  when the detectors went off just take your mask off as a sign of see it's safe
[03:35:37.920 --> 03:35:42.840]  by the way we're gonna helicopter out of here as the generals real fast knowing
[03:35:42.840 --> 03:35:47.960]  it was a slow death death sentence did they cross anybody know it's like they
[03:35:47.960 --> 03:35:54.000]  get off on hurting people what do you think that psychology is because they
[03:35:54.000 --> 03:35:58.720]  use psychology on us but they're the ones that are really screwed up well I
[03:35:58.720 --> 03:36:03.320]  mean they're so yeah a lot of the hallmarks of psychopaths I mean you
[03:36:03.320 --> 03:36:08.080]  know and it's a psychopaths are what genetic and environmental and they're
[03:36:08.080 --> 03:36:11.400]  told from birth that they're you know through social Darwinism that they're
[03:36:11.400 --> 03:36:16.640]  superior to you know all the rest of us and yeah it's it's like Orwell talking
[03:36:16.640 --> 03:36:20.800]  about you know it's the it's the thrill of victory over a helpless victim you
[03:36:20.800 --> 03:36:24.120]  know and we're traveling and being traveled forever yeah and that's one
[03:36:24.120 --> 03:36:27.480]  of the things that dr. Bush Levine talks about in in state of mind is learned
[03:36:27.480 --> 03:36:32.240]  helplessness and I think this is what you know people have to overcome in
[03:36:32.240 --> 03:36:35.960]  order to really get engaged and get involved and it's you know after so
[03:36:35.960 --> 03:36:39.600]  many times of thinking that they can't do anything that they are powerless then
[03:36:39.600 --> 03:36:43.360]  they just start to stop trying you know and it's just getting that getting up
[03:36:43.360 --> 03:36:48.080]  getting that motivation to try to stop giving up and like this this big man he
[03:36:48.080 --> 03:36:50.920]  you know he's he's not gonna roll over he's not he doesn't have to learn
[03:36:50.920 --> 03:36:53.920]  helplessness he says he's gonna get involved and do something and you know
[03:36:53.920 --> 03:36:56.800]  more brave people like that need to step up and that's that's where we hit the
[03:36:56.800 --> 03:37:00.360]  critical mass well he made the decision on there he said I'm gonna do more I'm
[03:37:00.360 --> 03:37:04.720]  gonna go full into this and I could hear him doing that and I didn't tell him
[03:37:04.720 --> 03:37:07.960]  you know who I thought was behind it and stuff off air to scare him I wanted him
[03:37:07.960 --> 03:37:12.640]  to know and it was so he understands you okay listen you you're not you're not
[03:37:12.640 --> 03:37:15.960]  imagining this but you're common sense you know they killed your body and if
[03:37:15.960 --> 03:37:19.680]  you're gonna come out come out big you know because then it more people will be
[03:37:19.680 --> 03:37:23.040]  aware if they actually that's what Garrison said yeah Jim Garrison yeah
[03:37:23.040 --> 03:37:26.880]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shafer says in his extended interview I think it got
[03:37:26.880 --> 03:37:30.400]  cut from the film but he says at one point he explains very clearly that the
[03:37:30.400 --> 03:37:34.320]  Pentagon's rules for information warfare include assassinations and so he
[03:37:34.320 --> 03:37:38.000]  explains that if there's a political figure if there's an activist figure if
[03:37:38.000 --> 03:37:41.720]  there's a whistleblower figure that that falls under the realm of info war of
[03:37:41.720 --> 03:37:45.000]  psychological warfare and info war the carrying out of assassinations on
[03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:49.120]  activists so we're looking at interest specific klepto parasites here these are
[03:37:49.120 --> 03:37:52.400]  people of the same species who are preying on us they they prey on our
[03:37:52.400 --> 03:37:57.800]  we produce they say that again interest specific klepto parasites did you
[03:37:57.800 --> 03:38:03.560]  point that no it's a 1952 paper by Miriam Rothschild so they study animals
[03:38:03.560 --> 03:38:06.320]  they there's a whole bunch of Rothschild species from you know they use their
[03:38:06.320 --> 03:38:09.960]  money to study animals and human beings to understand us and control us so
[03:38:09.960 --> 03:38:12.840]  there's Rothschild giraffes butterflies all these different things so they find
[03:38:12.840 --> 03:38:15.560]  no I knew they named a lot of animals ever themselves right so they came up
[03:38:15.560 --> 03:38:19.040]  with this term for it was it was a gulls that they were studying at the time but
[03:38:19.040 --> 03:38:23.040]  they're saying of the same species preying on each other and that's what
[03:38:23.040 --> 03:38:27.120]  I've said is that's what it is it is predator guilds above us we are not the
[03:38:27.120 --> 03:38:31.640]  apex predator the psychopath inbred guild is the apex predator when they built
[03:38:31.640 --> 03:38:36.440]  protection systems over time so these are multi-generational guilds of of
[03:38:36.440 --> 03:38:41.060]  psychopaths of sociopaths of people who don't care about anyone else's free
[03:38:41.060 --> 03:38:45.440]  rights or free will they enjoy actually they get off on taking the power I mean
[03:38:45.440 --> 03:38:49.440]  look at the BBC with their child raping guild I mean it's you know and they need
[03:38:49.440 --> 03:38:52.120]  people's fear to control them because fear shuts down your mind it makes you
[03:38:52.120 --> 03:38:56.240]  stimulus response stimulus response is slavery stimulus thinking response is
[03:38:56.240 --> 03:38:59.680]  freedom we have to put that thinking back in between stimulus and response what
[03:38:59.680 --> 03:39:03.480]  would you call the instinct just to absolutely have to resist this that's
[03:39:03.480 --> 03:39:08.480]  my resume I mean I'm trying to stop species death my whole instinct is defend
[03:39:08.480 --> 03:39:11.640]  humanity stop these people I think that's just being human man I think that's
[03:39:11.640 --> 03:39:15.080]  just the human response to this abnormal situation that has gotten out of hand
[03:39:15.080 --> 03:39:18.480]  because we've been lied to for so long but now we're and what happens is good
[03:39:18.480 --> 03:39:22.280]  people are just as mean or even meaner than these mean people we just don't get
[03:39:22.280 --> 03:39:26.520]  in that mode they know once we get in the mode they're done right once we get in
[03:39:26.520 --> 03:39:29.400]  the mode it's over for them right and we have to be serious about this because
[03:39:29.400 --> 03:39:32.800]  there's no do-overs there's no Mulligans right and so we all have to work
[03:39:32.800 --> 03:39:35.840]  together we have to unite all the forces that you know and get together on
[03:39:35.840 --> 03:39:39.240]  common ground we have commonality with every other human being on this planet
[03:39:39.240 --> 03:39:42.840]  in so far as that we want our right to live we want our right to property so
[03:39:42.840 --> 03:39:45.560]  that we can preserve our life and these sort of things and this other group just
[03:39:45.560 --> 03:39:48.880]  wants to take that away and there's a long credible history to it and it's sad
[03:39:48.880 --> 03:39:52.120]  that American children are being denied that education in school well they admit
[03:39:52.120 --> 03:39:56.680]  it's a multi-thousand-year war against humanity and that's why they call it the
[03:39:56.680 --> 03:40:01.960]  final revolution finally breaking us where we can never defeat them again
[03:40:01.960 --> 03:40:05.960]  it's very obvious to all the listeners you know that it's moving
[03:40:05.960 --> 03:40:09.000]  towards a collectivist plan I mean that's all the obvious goal but now
[03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:12.120]  you're trying getting trying to get a lot of individualists to act in in a
[03:40:12.120 --> 03:40:16.400]  collective manner and it is difficult sometimes but it's just because you know
[03:40:16.400 --> 03:40:20.240]  maybe this activist path is different than the other that doesn't mean that
[03:40:20.240 --> 03:40:23.720]  we're not all heading to the same destiny all roads lead to the end of the New
[03:40:23.720 --> 03:40:26.720]  World Order exactly and in fact the fact that we're going in so many different
[03:40:26.720 --> 03:40:30.240]  directions is why they can't stop us that that's when my goal is just to
[03:40:30.240 --> 03:40:33.320]  generate as many resistance operations so the fact that we're becoming
[03:40:33.320 --> 03:40:36.360]  autonomous because we're thinking for ourselves and directing ourselves and
[03:40:36.360 --> 03:40:39.120]  nobody's telling us to go out and do this American schooling is based on a
[03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:42.640]  Prussian schooling model which as you very well know leaves people to be
[03:40:42.640 --> 03:40:46.600]  obedient servants not self-critical no self thinkers that are critically
[03:40:46.600 --> 03:40:49.600]  thinking about their life the most important thing I do now is everywhere
[03:40:49.600 --> 03:40:53.080]  in public even my wife or kids are there I just start talking about the New World
[03:40:53.080 --> 03:40:57.360]  Order and I make a big scene and in a nice way when somebody tries to peck at
[03:40:57.360 --> 03:41:01.360]  me in a bureaucratic way I just go okay let's let's just get it out in the open
[03:41:01.360 --> 03:41:05.640]  here this is going to be this goes two ways I'm about to inform you and they
[03:41:05.640 --> 03:41:08.920]  always go I actually know that's true I go you know you're a slave you know the
[03:41:08.920 --> 03:41:12.480]  systems after you you know you're acting pathetic on a power trip imagining
[03:41:12.480 --> 03:41:16.040]  you're in charge tune into your real humanity right now and stop acting like
[03:41:16.040 --> 03:41:19.360]  that and it almost always breaks their trance well and they've wrote books
[03:41:19.360 --> 03:41:24.520]  about this true history like 1939 HD Wells' New World Order he very clearly in
[03:41:24.520 --> 03:41:27.400]  there says that they wanted to create a world government and create a new
[03:41:27.400 --> 03:41:30.360]  religion that new religion is non-critical thinking it's stimulus
[03:41:30.360 --> 03:41:36.040]  response operant conditioning is the religion robot robot exactly yeah I'm
[03:41:36.040 --> 03:41:39.160]  just turning people into a cogs in the machine what was it like for you as you
[03:41:39.160 --> 03:41:42.760]  began to discover this stuff I was pretty scary because everyone was just like
[03:41:42.760 --> 03:41:46.280]  drop it and go back to work go find another job just get along to go you
[03:41:46.280 --> 03:41:49.880]  know go along to get along don't worry about this and people were saying look
[03:41:49.880 --> 03:41:53.080]  it doesn't really matter if there's a backdoor in the Sarbanes Oxley software
[03:41:53.080 --> 03:41:57.640]  that's federally mandated to protect from another Enron or Tyco and Tyco was one
[03:41:57.640 --> 03:42:01.280]  of my clients and they said we don't want to keep this data like the regulations
[03:42:01.280 --> 03:42:04.440]  say we want to use the backdoor so we can hide all this stuff so what you see
[03:42:04.440 --> 03:42:08.920]  with the financial collapse and all this NSA spying is they've kept every piece
[03:42:08.920 --> 03:42:13.160]  of information except the evidence to catch the people who stole the the
[03:42:13.160 --> 03:42:16.800]  quadrillions of dollars it's just like the electronic voting machine software
[03:42:16.800 --> 03:42:21.160]  always is designed to let the hacker in and then close it and cover it up right
[03:42:21.160 --> 03:42:25.560]  it's a system designed for crime right I mean unbelievable it's a it's a
[03:42:25.560 --> 03:42:29.000]  prophylactic product but that prophylactic has a hole in it purposely
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:32.680]  because they're they're trying to get America pregnant with this criminal
[03:42:32.680 --> 03:42:37.120]  sign of syndicate well what they do is they always create trapdoors for them
[03:42:37.120 --> 03:42:40.680]  but that we don't know about right like all the rich people they don't pay any
[03:42:40.680 --> 03:42:44.920]  taxes they don't give tips these globalists are all the same that's why
[03:42:44.920 --> 03:42:48.400]  people always hate the Bilderberg so bad they'll go and have like $500 a piece
[03:42:48.400 --> 03:42:53.200]  dinners and then not even pay for it and taxpayers pay and then no tip and then
[03:42:53.200 --> 03:42:57.560]  say I want this man fired he looked me in the eyes if you imagine controlling
[03:42:57.560 --> 03:43:01.280]  trillions of dollars having hundreds of billions in your account and you enjoy
[03:43:01.280 --> 03:43:05.880]  the fact that the waiter can't pay their bills you enjoy they're not doing good
[03:43:05.880 --> 03:43:10.440]  you enjoy I mean can you imagine that well in the corporate world you know like
[03:43:10.440 --> 03:43:14.000]  I said when you find out about this stuff it seems incredible or like it's not
[03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:17.840]  credible but then you find a book like David Rothkopf's superclass he's a
[03:43:17.840 --> 03:43:21.320]  member of the CFR and this Carnegie Institute so he's telling you there's
[03:43:21.320 --> 03:43:24.640]  6,000 individuals around the world who act as a superclass to whom laws don't
[03:43:24.640 --> 03:43:28.800]  really apply and they control what we think is voted on with you know check
[03:43:28.800 --> 03:43:32.440]  Rothkopf told me off air when he was head of the Kissinger group he said why
[03:43:32.440 --> 03:43:35.760]  John Harmon was around the show and heard it he goes I came on I know who you
[03:43:35.760 --> 03:43:40.160]  are Alex I came on because you need to join us you need to be part of this I'm
[03:43:40.160 --> 03:43:44.160]  just like and that they always it's always the same true believers well they
[03:43:44.160 --> 03:43:47.480]  told me you see it you need to be part of it the public will tear you into pieces
[03:43:47.480 --> 03:43:50.200]  well and I think a lot of that plays into the learn helplessness whenever
[03:43:50.200 --> 03:43:53.520]  they're too big to jail you know and they know they know you know as somebody
[03:43:53.520 --> 03:43:57.040]  else goes and steals a you know a hundred couple hundred dollar TV whatever
[03:43:57.040 --> 03:44:01.040]  they're in prison these guys are still you know trillions and and not anything
[03:44:01.040 --> 03:44:04.040]  happens to them that plays in the learn helplessness you know it's just that's
[03:44:04.040 --> 03:44:08.480]  more of no it's like a pimp in that famous HBO piece you know that she's
[03:44:08.480 --> 03:44:14.120]  been beat up run over she you know she's got broken bones disfigured and and and
[03:44:14.120 --> 03:44:20.240]  the pimp's going you know HBO goes what do you pay her and he goes nothing you
[03:44:20.240 --> 03:44:23.360]  know she's lucky if she eats once a day she's lucky about give her fried chicken
[03:44:23.360 --> 03:44:27.200]  and the mother goes how'd you do this to my baby and the woman's groveling to the
[03:44:27.200 --> 03:44:31.880]  pimp and and that's what that's what TSA all of it is is just worshipping that
[03:44:31.880 --> 03:44:35.840]  we're scum and filth and the cops can kill us whenever they want tasers whenever
[03:44:35.840 --> 03:44:39.800]  they want it is just it is the wheat they are breaking our will and the mind
[03:44:39.800 --> 03:44:42.600]  control of the of the pimp over the prostitute is no different than the
[03:44:42.600 --> 03:44:45.560]  person who owned a gladiator back in the day a man's small and snatched
[03:44:45.560 --> 03:44:49.240]  saturated and could use fear and words and mind control a bigger man and get
[03:44:49.240 --> 03:44:53.080]  him to fight for entertainment so what you have is the New World Order the
[03:44:53.080 --> 03:44:55.680]  difference between them and us is but is that they don't have faith in the
[03:44:55.680 --> 03:44:58.840]  public they think we're animals and we have faith in the public we know people
[03:44:58.840 --> 03:45:02.520]  can adapt evolve and overcome they can learn they can reignite their curiosity
[03:45:02.520 --> 03:45:05.720]  and start to take it upon themselves not to be a victim in this system that
[03:45:05.720 --> 03:45:09.720]  makes everyone a victim until you know what's going on well I just think it's
[03:45:09.720 --> 03:45:13.920]  important to get crazed again like a original human and just get angry we
[03:45:13.920 --> 03:45:17.400]  have the instincts of the programming to crush psychos they didn't they need to
[03:45:17.400 --> 03:45:21.760]  be crushed I mean that's what got me motivated was just the anger over it
[03:45:21.760 --> 03:45:26.800]  you know it's like that after that you can't stop you know it's like again
[03:45:26.800 --> 03:45:29.840]  just that first step and you get you get the motivation get moving forward and
[03:45:29.840 --> 03:45:33.680]  getting angry at first as part of it you know that's how you start thinking I'm
[03:45:33.680 --> 03:45:36.960]  a free human being I mean it's like what is it like drawing the blood to hear and
[03:45:36.960 --> 03:45:41.960]  in checkpoints it's like what if I don't I don't even own my blood you know
[03:45:41.960 --> 03:45:46.200]  they're just normalizing the tyranny and the general public select the broken
[03:45:46.200 --> 03:45:50.760]  whore going but he's my baby you know he's taking care of me when he beats me
[03:45:50.760 --> 03:45:54.720]  with a coat hanger I mean it's just incredible and the angers when you break
[03:45:54.720 --> 03:45:59.000]  out of the trance it's the outrage is the transfer from the anger to outrage
[03:45:59.000 --> 03:46:01.760]  where you actually start thinking and dissecting and paying attention and
[03:46:01.760 --> 03:46:04.800]  focusing on what they're doing I think that's the step that people need to go
[03:46:04.800 --> 03:46:09.520]  and then it's the resistance at any opportunity of the targeting just every
[03:46:09.520 --> 03:46:13.040]  level you're gonna bring them down you're now in a war with them and it gives
[03:46:13.040 --> 03:46:17.360]  your life meaning because survival is victory and we've always been fighting
[03:46:17.360 --> 03:46:21.480]  for survival this is what humans are meant to do and and we are under the
[03:46:21.480 --> 03:46:25.480]  scientific technocracy the scientific dictatorship they're trying to complete
[03:46:25.480 --> 03:46:30.400]  and the messages we've transmitted are going to grow in power against them as
[03:46:30.400 --> 03:46:35.000]  their program rolls out this is going to echo forever we don't know what chain
[03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:40.040]  reaction we're engaging in right now that will sever their control yeah and
[03:46:40.040 --> 03:46:43.600]  then after you start to develop a love for humanity then you know that's
[03:46:43.600 --> 03:46:47.800]  that's really where you you broke free you know yes as you remove your
[03:46:47.800 --> 03:46:52.040]  conditioning you know again start to learn reason logic how to think you know
[03:46:52.040 --> 03:46:56.920]  yeah and commit I mean what about the feeling of commitment but I think the
[03:46:56.920 --> 03:47:00.320]  love that love for humanity that's what that's what drives you know so many of
[03:47:00.320 --> 03:47:03.960]  us I think to continue to do what we do in risk I think you commit to think or
[03:47:03.960 --> 03:47:06.360]  not to think and you have to make that choice you're either gonna be a thinker
[03:47:06.360 --> 03:47:09.640]  or you're gonna be someone to respond to all the stimulus America's future lies
[03:47:09.640 --> 03:47:13.680]  in individuals having autonomy being able to ask questions because all learning
[03:47:13.680 --> 03:47:16.800]  starts from the question mark they teach us with declarative sentences and all
[03:47:16.800 --> 03:47:19.480]  these books that you so you can't gain knowledge from hearing someone else use
[03:47:19.480 --> 03:47:22.760]  a declarative sentence you have to go through your observation identification
[03:47:22.760 --> 03:47:26.320]  organization and communication process to actually learn they're killing the
[03:47:26.320 --> 03:47:30.480]  scientific method right so they're they're doing this to us because they
[03:47:30.480 --> 03:47:34.760]  are kind of jealous of us they can't be happy just with what we have as normal
[03:47:34.760 --> 03:47:38.400]  human beings they have to have it all they have a sickness call it greed call
[03:47:38.400 --> 03:47:41.680]  it aggression call it whatever you want troll-freakism control-freakism and
[03:47:41.680 --> 03:47:44.920]  they've been trying to dissolve everything that made America what it was
[03:47:44.920 --> 03:47:48.400]  to stand alone from the British and reintegrate us into an Anglo-American
[03:47:48.400 --> 03:47:51.920]  establishment so you know through the legacy of Cecil Rhodes and the CFR and
[03:47:51.920 --> 03:47:54.640]  Pilgrim Society and foreign affairs and all these different you know working
[03:47:54.640 --> 03:47:57.680]  groups and different projects tell me about this foreign affairs publication
[03:47:57.680 --> 03:48:01.520]  foreign affairs article basically talking about transnationalism and
[03:48:01.520 --> 03:48:05.240]  transnationalists do not have grandiose plans for a one-world government but
[03:48:05.240 --> 03:48:09.280]  they but they give various rules of force of law without having to win
[03:48:09.280 --> 03:48:13.960]  majorities for those for those rules and democratically elected legislatures so
[03:48:13.960 --> 03:48:16.800]  basically through this idea of transnationalism they're changing
[03:48:16.800 --> 03:48:19.600]  America we don't want world government we're just about the law right and they're
[03:48:19.600 --> 03:48:23.400]  above the Constitution and so in very clever words speak you can learn I mean
[03:48:23.400 --> 03:48:26.120]  because they know they always say we're not setting up world government right
[03:48:26.120 --> 03:48:30.160]  we're setting up global governance I first became a fan of foreign affairs
[03:48:30.160 --> 03:48:35.120]  there's a 1998 November issue show people it's got the red tag on there
[03:48:35.120 --> 03:48:39.440]  where they talk about Osama bin Laden you know war on terror and all these
[03:48:39.440 --> 03:48:43.320]  things like three or four years before 2001 and the same people are writing the
[03:48:43.320 --> 03:48:46.600]  articles as Alakau is one of the people he was in charge of the 9-11
[03:48:46.600 --> 03:48:50.040]  Commission so you can totally see how they put out a business plan in a couple
[03:48:50.040 --> 03:48:54.680]  of different articles in one CFR magazine in 1998 and then that comes to
[03:48:54.680 --> 03:48:59.920]  fruition and then PNAC rewrites it right September 2000 says we need we need a
[03:48:59.920 --> 03:49:02.680]  Pearl Harbor to tax we can invade Afghanistan take everybody's liberty
[03:49:02.680 --> 03:49:06.920]  right I mean they don't even mince words it's all planned right on the open yeah
[03:49:06.920 --> 03:49:10.160]  so you just got to you just got to do the research just find it and it's what's
[03:49:10.160 --> 03:49:13.400]  you know again great about you know being able to get the resources that you
[03:49:13.400 --> 03:49:17.520]  know but that's what's frustrating is it's all admitted and it's all out there
[03:49:17.520 --> 03:49:21.840]  like Della said America Americans don't read but all these books like I have 20
[03:49:21.840 --> 03:49:25.080]  or 30 books just on a Rothschild's autobiographies biographies like this
[03:49:25.080 --> 03:49:29.240]  is their own primary sources this isn't some tertiary no no they say they're
[03:49:29.240 --> 03:49:32.400]  doing it right it says on their own website this is their history and you
[03:49:32.400 --> 03:49:35.160]  know battle of Waterloo and the whole history that you hear about as
[03:49:35.160 --> 03:49:38.800]  conspiracy is on the official Rothschild websites so as I went through and
[03:49:38.800 --> 03:49:42.680]  familiarize myself with how these all these social institutions like roll
[03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:46.080]  call congressional quarterly economists those are all Rothschild entities the
[03:49:46.080 --> 03:49:49.320]  official magazines of our Congress are owned through the Rothschild banking
[03:49:49.320 --> 03:49:53.880]  empire so when you look at their control over media and politics CIA set up
[03:49:53.880 --> 03:49:58.080]  national review sure and so it's not just one group of people there's a common
[03:49:58.080 --> 03:50:01.480]  agenda of collectivism that's gone on through history and the individuals not
[03:50:01.480 --> 03:50:05.080]  able to demonstrate intellectual self-defense until you grasp the same
[03:50:05.080 --> 03:50:08.040]  tools that they're using against you and you use them for yourself for liberty
[03:50:08.040 --> 03:50:11.200]  and the liberty of others instead of trying to oppress everybody like they're
[03:50:11.200 --> 03:50:16.880]  doing man it is so amazing but that that they own the whole fake spectrum of
[03:50:16.880 --> 03:50:22.680]  alternative media you know the so-called turn of media like foreign affairs which
[03:50:22.680 --> 03:50:26.520]  is actually put out by the CFR and they act like it's alternative or you get
[03:50:26.520 --> 03:50:30.520]  things like national review and then I know I built all this myself with my
[03:50:30.520 --> 03:50:33.160]  listeners that I'm not controlled and I know there's other people that aren't
[03:50:33.160 --> 03:50:36.760]  controlled I think that's what's really freaking amount is that they were going
[03:50:36.760 --> 03:50:39.440]  off an old paradigm that oh they won't know how to use video editing they
[03:50:39.440 --> 03:50:42.720]  won't know how to use this they won't be able to do that but it backfired I
[03:50:42.720 --> 03:50:46.960]  don't I think they're in deep trouble sir on humorous you know and what is it
[03:50:46.960 --> 03:50:50.320]  a Hillary Clinton said you know they're losing the information war I mean
[03:50:50.320 --> 03:50:53.760]  they're coming out saying it what the gods would conquer they must first
[03:50:53.760 --> 03:50:56.920]  divide and if we make ourselves individuals who are unassailable
[03:50:56.920 --> 03:51:00.720]  intellectually and we can bind together voluntarily with other individuals to
[03:51:00.720 --> 03:51:03.800]  secure our liberty there's some aggregate that one all of your

[03:54:36.640 --> 03:54:41.560]  that'll air when we premiere State of Mind for the prison planet TV viewers but
[03:54:41.560 --> 03:54:45.360]  you guys in the last five minutes and make any other points because I really
[03:54:45.360 --> 03:54:49.320]  agree with your analysis you guys have done your research and I just think it's
[03:54:49.320 --> 03:54:54.760]  fantastic to see the knowledge of the globalist tyranny spreading we now have
[03:54:54.760 --> 03:55:00.240]  the fire of Prometheus which with which we can burn the devil to the ground we
[03:55:00.240 --> 03:55:03.520]  were saying that State of Mind touches on every subject that that's covered on
[03:55:03.520 --> 03:55:07.520]  info wars this is a this is a hub that people can use to show the friends of
[03:55:07.520 --> 03:55:10.640]  Emily all the spokes that they can go from there it's a it's a jumping point
[03:55:10.640 --> 03:55:14.000]  so I wore applies to every subject you guys cover on info wars and so it's the
[03:55:14.000 --> 03:55:17.080]  it's the primary thing when we send our kids out to public schools without
[03:55:17.080 --> 03:55:20.720]  letting them know how to tell when someone's lying to them you know we send
[03:55:20.720 --> 03:55:23.640]  our kids out in the world unprepared and we never really outgrow that extent
[03:55:23.640 --> 03:55:27.160]  if you send them letting them know it's a brainwashing camp it'll actually work
[03:55:27.160 --> 03:55:30.720]  against the enemy right your kids genetically know to listen to you right
[03:55:30.720 --> 03:55:33.120]  so they spent a lot of time trying to divide and conquer our homes and what
[03:55:33.120 --> 03:55:36.600]  the gods would seek to conquer they must first divide so if we recognize that
[03:55:36.600 --> 03:55:39.320]  there is an info war there's a war on for our mind and we need to get
[03:55:39.320 --> 03:55:42.280]  together with our we need to get together with our friends and family and
[03:55:42.280 --> 03:55:45.800]  we need to learn our way out of this we need to act voluntarily to form groups
[03:55:45.800 --> 03:55:49.640]  and that's how we keep ourselves safe not by waiting for the state or the
[03:55:49.640 --> 03:55:52.760]  authorities to come and protect us you know in the case of Boston there's a
[03:55:52.760 --> 03:55:56.800]  million people on lockdown to find one 19 year old suspect that's unreasonable
[03:55:56.800 --> 03:56:01.160]  insanity yeah it's yes it is walking up to people's houses and they're like oh
[03:56:01.160 --> 03:56:04.680]  no that's fine come on in you know and it's only gonna get worse unless we you
[03:56:04.680 --> 03:56:08.280]  know intellectually rise up practice intellectual self-defense which is
[03:56:08.280 --> 03:56:11.400]  knowing how to deal with the words and the lies and the process them and remove
[03:56:11.400 --> 03:56:16.920]  the fallacies so that we can actually find knowledge consistently absolutely
[03:56:16.920 --> 03:56:19.840]  you wanted to get into Huxley I heard you mentioning hammer well you had
[03:56:19.840 --> 03:56:22.520]  mentioned Huxley before and I couldn't help thinking about the ultimate
[03:56:22.520 --> 03:56:26.280]  revolution speech that he gave at Berkeley I believe in 1961 or 62 where
[03:56:26.280 --> 03:56:30.680]  he says you know we're gonna make you love your servitude and that the human
[03:56:30.680 --> 03:56:33.360]  being if you don't think between stimulus and response they're gonna have
[03:56:33.360 --> 03:56:36.880]  total control because there's a unity box on everyone's wall and it's it's
[03:56:36.880 --> 03:56:39.960]  giving you the corporate media it's giving you all the same news on every
[03:56:39.960 --> 03:56:43.280]  channel you know different logos it's all the same news and so you have to get
[03:56:43.280 --> 03:56:46.240]  beyond that you actually have to start using your observation skills and go
[03:56:46.240 --> 03:56:49.360]  beyond what they're showing you and that's where the real world is and
[03:56:49.360 --> 03:56:52.360]  that's what I think people can discover as a function of state of mind is they
[03:56:52.360 --> 03:56:56.400]  can grow they can outgrow the status quo well we found a an interview with my
[03:56:56.400 --> 03:57:01.680]  Mike Wallace I'll just I'm sorry Huxley was on there 1953 and he basically
[03:57:01.680 --> 03:57:05.640]  described the the world we're living in today you know and oh he said rave new
[03:57:05.640 --> 03:57:09.400]  world is our plan yeah and talk about the pharmacological control you know
[03:57:09.400 --> 03:57:13.360]  of the anti authoritarian personality I mean there was it's we see it every day
[03:57:13.360 --> 03:57:17.400]  I mean the kids are drugged every I mean anybody goes in for the slightest thing
[03:57:17.400 --> 03:57:20.520]  it's like oh just film full of pharmaceuticals and then say you have no
[03:57:20.520 --> 03:57:23.720]  rights once you've been another result of the psychedelic revolution which was
[03:57:23.720 --> 03:57:27.560]  part of MK ultra sub project 58 you honor venetnostic media has done a lot of
[03:57:27.560 --> 03:57:31.120]  great work on this because there are CIA documents for your request documents
[03:57:31.120 --> 03:57:34.440]  where you can see JP Morgan and company getting the financials here's how much
[03:57:34.440 --> 03:57:38.600]  money they're getting out of CIA MK ultra sub project 58 and that goes in a
[03:57:38.600 --> 03:57:46.640]  time-life magazine of May 27th 1957 May 13th 1957 time life it's the
[03:57:46.640 --> 03:57:50.080]  introduction of introduction of magic mushrooms to the world through Henry
[03:57:50.080 --> 03:57:54.320]  Luce's time-life magazine run by CD Jackson who is psychological warfare
[03:57:54.320 --> 03:57:59.240]  specialist who worked with Nelson Rockefeller but then it backfired and
[03:57:59.240 --> 03:58:02.960]  they wanted it removed yeah and then they brought out the pros act yeah that's
[03:58:02.960 --> 03:58:06.480]  exactly right and you know most of these psychotropic drugs are just a
[03:58:06.480 --> 03:58:10.760]  synthetic lsd without the the trippiness to it so they are very
[03:58:10.760 --> 03:58:14.000]  feel like molecularly they're very similar they got them in dream states
[03:58:14.000 --> 03:58:19.840]  yeah program state so people on this 20% of the public roughly are on a mind
[03:58:19.840 --> 03:58:23.520]  control programming drug now to be interfaced with the subliminals and
[03:58:23.520 --> 03:58:26.360]  Huxley's talking about that way there'd be a combination of propaganda and in
[03:58:26.360 --> 03:58:29.880]  pharmacological control diet injections and injunctions first Russell talks
[03:58:29.880 --> 03:58:33.840]  about this was in ski talks guys get the film state of mind and for store.com
[03:58:33.840 --> 03:58:38.000]  see you back live tomorrow God bless you all.
