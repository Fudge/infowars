[00:00.000 --> 00:20.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is December 18, 2020, I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20.640 --> 00:24.000]  And I always go according to the tea leaves and the facts and the research I can get and
[00:24.000 --> 00:27.720]  I was telling you that it was a long shot for Trump to turn this theft around unless
[00:27.720 --> 00:29.600]  he started taking action.
[00:29.600 --> 00:35.320]  Well just the last four or five days we've started to see the gates of the undersea
[00:35.320 --> 00:38.120]  lair open and the Kraken has now swam out.
[00:38.120 --> 00:40.320]  The question is, will the dog hunt?
[00:40.320 --> 00:47.080]  But it is on, ladies and gentlemen, wow, what a broadcast today with 34 days out from the
[00:47.080 --> 00:51.280]  attempted globalist takeover with their tricom puppet, Joe Biden.
[00:51.280 --> 00:56.080]  So right now, let's hear what CBS News had to hear about the documented, not like the
[00:56.080 --> 01:01.800]  Russian stuff, the documented foreign interference for Joe Biden.
[01:01.800 --> 01:06.360]  What did Radcliffe say about election fraud and interference?
[01:06.360 --> 01:13.280]  Well D&I Radcliffe leads the 17 intelligence agencies and he has access to the most highly
[01:13.280 --> 01:18.680]  classified information that is held by the US government and he told CBS News that there
[01:18.680 --> 01:25.000]  was foreign election interference by China, Iran and Russia in November of this year and
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.120]  he is anticipating a public report on those findings in January.
[01:30.120 --> 01:34.720]  Well you've got to act now on this, I mean you've got the people with the suitcases pulling
[01:34.720 --> 01:39.320]  out from underneath in Georgia at the CNN center, cramming them into the machine saying
[01:39.320 --> 01:41.200]  a water main had broken.
[01:41.200 --> 01:45.840]  You've got all this other incredible evidence, the question is, do we take action?
[01:45.840 --> 01:50.160]  Well first you have to define, this is a foreign takeover, the blue cities and states are under
[01:50.160 --> 01:55.240]  Chikon martial law and under the law it takes a civil emergency to remove them, that's where
[01:55.240 --> 01:56.240]  we are.
[01:56.240 --> 01:58.320]  Or if we're not ready to face that threat, they win.
[01:58.320 --> 02:02.680]  Here is what General Flynn just had to say about it on Newsmax.
[02:02.680 --> 02:08.440]  Also ordered, he could order the, within the swinging states, if he wanted to, he could
[02:08.440 --> 02:13.960]  take military capabilities and he could place them in those states and basically rerun an
[02:13.960 --> 02:17.600]  election in each of those states, I mean it's not impressive and I mean these people out
[02:17.600 --> 02:21.280]  there talking about martial law, it's like it's something that we've never done.
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.840]  We've done, martial law has been instituted 64, 64 times Greg.
[02:26.840 --> 02:32.560]  So I'm not calling for that, we have a constitutional process, we clearly have a constitutional process.
[02:32.560 --> 02:40.040]  I think you highlighted some of that in your previous segment, that has to be followed.
[02:40.040 --> 02:45.800]  So again, this is the wheelhouse we're in, I don't want what you call martial law but
[02:45.800 --> 02:51.080]  when you're already, if Martians landed, if 5,000 Martian spaceships landed with ray
[02:51.080 --> 02:54.720]  guns, started going around blowing up all the government buildings, martial law will
[02:54.720 --> 03:01.040]  be declared, regular law will be suspended, they tell you to run for the hills or hide
[03:01.040 --> 03:07.560]  in your basement and they go out and attack the Martians.
[03:07.560 --> 03:11.640]  We're under attack, the globalists, the chai comms are the Martians, the mainstream media,
[03:11.640 --> 03:15.000]  the leftists even when they're green and purple hair are the Martians.
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.320]  So do we respond to their takeover, they've already put us under lockdown, they've already
[03:18.320 --> 03:21.360]  put us under martial law, they're already telling us, look at medical ID's to leave
[03:21.360 --> 03:22.360]  our houses.
[03:22.360 --> 03:30.200]  Now, here's my only problem, Trump already capitulated so much to the inoculations and
[03:30.200 --> 03:33.680]  the COVID propaganda, later he stood up to it, later he took the mask off, later he had
[03:33.680 --> 03:39.040]  the rallies, I know he's a good guy but how will they manipulate him if he removes Biden
[03:39.040 --> 03:42.440]  and these globalists and then we don't just set up some new nightmare.
[03:42.440 --> 03:48.440]  We're going to open the phones up, I did a new show today called American Journal,
[03:48.440 --> 03:53.720]  in an ode to Washington Journal, we took five times the calls, we usually did, we did a
[03:53.720 --> 03:59.040]  great job, took over 50 calls, played a lot of clips, it was powerful and we'll be hosting
[03:59.040 --> 04:05.880]  that next week, myself, Owen Schreuer and others, 8 to 11 p.m. Central Standard Time,
[04:05.880 --> 04:10.080]  this is of course the Alex Jones show but we had about, I don't know, 15 callers or
[04:10.080 --> 04:16.160]  so on hold, when the show ended so I said, hey, transfer them over and they're like,
[04:16.160 --> 04:20.520]  well it's a different phone system so we got their numbers, we're going to call them back,
[04:20.520 --> 04:24.960]  get them up first, we're going to go to all of them at the bottom of the hour on the subject
[04:24.960 --> 04:29.040]  they called in about, what do you call it if Trump moves against the deep state, they're
[04:29.040 --> 04:32.200]  going to call it martial law with the bad connotations, plunge is being honest about
[04:32.200 --> 04:36.880]  what it is, do we just let them have their own Chinese globalist martial law or is there
[04:36.880 --> 04:41.000]  another way to fix this, if the evidence is mounting they did do this and then it's Trump's
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.120]  duty to take action, the question is how does he take action constitutionally, legally
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.760]  and lawfully, and then we've also got the huge news on the inoculations rolling out
[04:49.760 --> 05:16.320]  and all the adverse reactions taking place from that, stay with us, this is the InfoWars.
[05:16.320 --> 05:23.040]  Have you heard of InfoWars.com, they're so scared of you being able to communicate and
[05:23.040 --> 05:28.360]  share the truth, but we're bringing in the same amount of money we brought in last December
[05:28.360 --> 05:33.160]  right now, this is our most important month to fund ourselves in the next year and I understand
[05:33.160 --> 05:36.000]  the economy shut down, I understand there's not as much money as they're used to be, they're
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.400]  trying to kill Trump's recovery, but InfoWars really needs your support, you just buy great
[05:40.400 --> 05:45.520]  items through your Christmas shopping and InfoWars.com with huge sales, amazing products
[05:45.520 --> 05:49.640]  and then you know you're funding the InfoWars and not funding Amazon and Jeff Bezos and
[05:49.640 --> 05:53.720]  the globalists that are openly trying to destroy small businesses, continue to fund the Second
[05:53.720 --> 05:57.480]  American Revolution, we're getting great products at the same time at InfoWars.com,
[05:57.480 --> 06:15.600]  thank you.
[06:15.600 --> 06:22.480]  I want to say I'm not Catholic, but I am proud of the conservative right wing Christian Catholics
[06:22.480 --> 06:26.920]  in America for standing up against the Communist Pope, they've got over there who's absolutely
[06:26.920 --> 06:33.560]  New World Order, anti-family, anti-God, anti-capitalism, Cardinal Burke has come out and said that
[06:33.560 --> 06:39.960]  the whole COVID-19 thing is being used as a satanic takeover of America, Senator Rand
[06:39.960 --> 06:44.320]  Paul has said it's been used as a hoax to basically steal the election, we've got that
[06:44.320 --> 06:52.440]  video clip coming up and we've also got again all these other individuals that are prominent
[06:52.440 --> 06:57.240]  coming out and speaking the truth, but here's a clip of Cardinal Burke, forces of the great
[06:57.240 --> 07:02.880]  reset have used COVID to advance evil agendas, true words whenever spoken, here it is.
[07:02.880 --> 07:11.360]  Our nation is going through a crisis which threatens its very future as free and democratic.
[07:11.360 --> 07:17.080]  The worldwide spread of Marxist materialism, which has already brought destruction and
[07:17.080 --> 07:24.200]  death to the lives of so many and which has threatened the foundations of our nation for
[07:24.200 --> 07:32.520]  decades and now seems to seize the governing power over our nation.
[07:32.520 --> 07:39.960]  To attain economic gains, we as a nation have permitted ourselves to become dependent upon
[07:39.960 --> 07:48.160]  the Chinese Communist Party in the ideology totally opposed to the Christian foundations
[07:48.160 --> 07:56.400]  upon which families and our nation remain safe and prosper.
[07:56.400 --> 08:04.920]  I speak of the United States of America, but evidently many other nations are in the throes
[08:04.920 --> 08:11.680]  of a similar most alarming crisis.
[08:11.680 --> 08:18.200]  Then there is the mysterious Wuhan virus about whose nature and prevention the mass
[08:18.200 --> 08:23.840]  media daily give us conflicting information.
[08:23.840 --> 08:32.160]  What is clear, however, is that it has been used by certain forces inimical to families
[08:32.160 --> 08:39.240]  and to the freedom of nations to advance their evil agenda.
[08:39.240 --> 08:49.800]  These forces tell us that we are now the subjects of the so-called great reset, the new normal,
[08:49.800 --> 08:57.040]  which is dictated to us by their manipulation of citizens and nations through ignorance
[08:57.040 --> 09:00.200]  and fear.
[09:00.200 --> 09:08.360]  Now we are supposed to find in a disease and its prevention the way to understand and direct
[09:08.360 --> 09:20.840]  our lives, rather than in God and in his plan for our salvation.
[09:20.840 --> 09:25.960]  See the full speech, top Catholic Cardinal Warren's COVID-19 being used to usher an
[09:25.960 --> 09:27.560]  evil great reset.
[09:27.560 --> 09:30.840]  So you've got the pedophile Satanists who have taken over part of the Catholic Church
[09:30.840 --> 09:34.600]  that are really Marxist-Leninists, and you've got these guys that are fighting them, and
[09:34.600 --> 09:39.040]  I've got to say it's some of these Catholic Cardinals and people that are the most on
[09:39.040 --> 09:44.240]  target, and so it just shows the civil war going on in every institution, whether it's
[09:44.240 --> 09:50.200]  the FBI, Protestant Churches, the Catholic Church, all of it, whether it's in public
[09:50.200 --> 09:57.440]  schools or in colleges or in families, this is good versus evil, period.
[09:57.440 --> 10:05.000]  Now I could spend an hour on this, but we have video out of Sweden and out of Canada
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.720]  of health ministers touring hospitals with mannequins in fake hospital beds, and they
[10:10.720 --> 10:12.920]  tell you it's real.
[10:12.920 --> 10:19.560]  We have footage coming in from all over California and Texas of people saying they're being injected,
[10:19.560 --> 10:23.200]  but the plunger's all the way down and there's nothing in the needle.
[10:23.200 --> 10:26.800]  There's nothing in the injector, you can see that.
[10:26.800 --> 10:30.680]  The media tried to deny it, now they go, okay, it's true, they said it's a mistake.
[10:30.680 --> 10:33.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can't believe a damn word these criminals say.
[10:33.680 --> 10:37.520]  They have gotten so many people now involved in the lie, but here's footage of something
[10:37.520 --> 10:38.520]  real.
[10:38.520 --> 10:45.000]  Here's a nurse in Tennessee who took the shot on TV and about nine minutes later collapses
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  and falls over.
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.880]  They said, oh, the vaccine did it, it's no big deal.
[10:49.880 --> 10:54.840]  Yes, we have a higher rate of people collapsing with this one, but it's no big deal.
[10:54.840 --> 10:59.120]  They're having an autoimmune response, the nervous system freaks out, has to reset and
[10:59.120 --> 11:00.120]  collapses.
[11:00.120 --> 11:05.840]  It's not a regular vaccine, it's an mRNA that is programming your very DNA, and if you've
[11:05.840 --> 11:09.840]  already been exposed to COVID, it can kill you, and that's when you have this cytokine
[11:09.840 --> 11:13.400]  storm being stung by 15Bs.
[11:13.400 --> 11:15.640]  Let's go ahead and roll the footage.
[11:15.640 --> 11:22.240]  All of my staff, we are excited to get the vaccine.
[11:22.240 --> 11:28.320]  We are in the COVID unit, so therefore, you know, my team will be getting first chances
[11:28.320 --> 11:29.680]  to get the vaccine.
[11:29.680 --> 11:39.680]  And I know that it's really, I'm sorry, I'm feeling really dizzy.
[11:39.680 --> 11:56.480]  And she had to be taken on as treacher.
[11:56.480 --> 12:03.320]  Now why did the British Ministry of Defense, one week into it two weeks ago, say you got
[12:03.320 --> 12:08.640]  to be in a hospital with resuscitation, defibrillation, full emergency room to take this, then they
[12:08.640 --> 12:13.960]  said, the advisory board said, look, pregnant women shouldn't take it, people under 16 shouldn't
[12:13.960 --> 12:18.440]  take it, people with autoimmune disorders or bad allergies shouldn't take it, and people
[12:18.440 --> 12:21.440]  over 75 shouldn't take it.
[12:21.440 --> 12:24.480]  But I thought it's totally safe and effective.
[12:24.480 --> 12:27.840]  So there she is on TV of your TV, or you can see her getting a shot, a few months later,
[12:27.840 --> 12:28.840]  she collapses.
[12:28.840 --> 12:31.000]  And they didn't deny the vaccine, did it?
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  Bill Gates said 700,000 you will get sick or die, he said 80% get sick from it.
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.080]  When I say that, media matters call for us to be shut down, it says Jones falsely claims
[12:41.080 --> 12:43.880]  80% get sick from the Pfizer vaccine.
[12:43.880 --> 12:50.440]  I have Bill Gates, his Godship, his Lord Commander, Supreme ruler of Earth saying they
[12:50.440 --> 12:54.440]  tried to get Joe Rogan taken off Spotify for playing it, for having me on to say that.
[12:54.440 --> 12:59.240]  Joe put the clip out, they crapped their britches.
[12:59.240 --> 13:04.280]  So see, they have to normalize getting everybody to just accept this, we're not going to accept
[13:04.280 --> 13:05.280]  it.
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.320]  All the big vaccine makers, it's not even a vaccine, it's a genetic takeover system.
[13:09.320 --> 13:14.880]  They all admit that it doesn't protect you from COVID and that it won't stop you from
[13:14.880 --> 13:15.880]  spreading COVID.
[13:15.880 --> 13:20.000]  Meanwhile, they're giving pregnant women the shots, even though on the insert it says
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.520]  don't give it to a pregnant woman, because it causes a huge autoimmune response and a
[13:23.520 --> 13:27.640]  lot of times the body then autoimmune responses the baby and kicks it out.
[13:27.640 --> 13:32.520]  She says, oh, my baby will have antibodies, oh, you'll have antibodies, all right.
[13:32.520 --> 13:35.640]  This isn't a regular vaccine, this will go in and change every cell in you.
[13:35.640 --> 13:40.120]  God knows what it'll do to the baby itself.
[13:40.120 --> 13:45.600]  We had a caller, I always pronounce it wrong and always forget about it.
[13:45.600 --> 13:52.600]  What was the drug they gave women that made tens of thousands of babies die in the U.S.
[13:52.600 --> 13:53.600]  even more overseas?
[13:53.600 --> 14:00.400]  And still others had no arms or legs or little bitty short legs, thymillomide or how do you
[14:00.400 --> 14:01.400]  say it?
[14:01.400 --> 14:02.400]  We'll look that up.
[14:02.400 --> 14:06.280]  We covered it there in the three hour show earlier, I mean, there's so many examples
[14:06.280 --> 14:10.560]  of this and they skipped animal trials on this and are doing mass trials and then I
[14:10.560 --> 14:19.280]  was called by a listener and he was on air and reminded me that there's actually a federal
[14:19.280 --> 14:24.520]  law saying we can all be experimented on in mass, HR 4373.
[14:24.520 --> 14:29.080]  So you know, we're all about documentation, the slugs over at George Soros Run Media Matters
[14:29.080 --> 14:37.040]  that literally are mercenaries against your very life are hoping you don't research this
[14:37.040 --> 14:38.200]  and look this up for yourself.
[14:38.200 --> 14:44.520]  I mean, the British government says pregnant women shouldn't take this malformations due
[14:44.520 --> 14:52.080]  to the maternal ingestion of I have pronouncing problems.
[14:52.080 --> 14:54.200]  It's foul minimized.
[14:54.200 --> 14:55.200]  Yeah.
[14:55.200 --> 14:56.200]  Wow.
[14:56.200 --> 15:03.320]  But hey, it's okay because Tim Cook's okay.
[15:03.320 --> 15:08.040]  And by the way, when you read they're giving Chinese communist soldiers quote super genetic
[15:08.040 --> 15:12.880]  mutinogens, it's mRNA vaccines to make their muscles bigger and make them more aggressive.
[15:12.880 --> 15:14.760]  I'm like, you're, it's okay.
[15:14.760 --> 15:15.760]  You're a super soldier.
[15:15.760 --> 15:17.120]  We're not testing on you or anything.
[15:17.120 --> 15:18.120]  You're not a guinea pig.
[15:18.120 --> 15:19.120]  You're not a victim.
[15:19.120 --> 15:20.120]  You're a super soldier.
[15:20.120 --> 15:24.800]  But with us, they tell us, oh, it's just a vaccine and then the top scientists that
[15:24.800 --> 15:30.080]  aren't on their payroll, former head of Pfizer science division comes out and says, we looked
[15:30.080 --> 15:31.080]  at this.
[15:31.080 --> 15:33.560]  This doesn't anything to do with COVID.
[15:33.560 --> 15:36.280]  We match it to other vaccines and attack the protein of placenta.
[15:36.280 --> 15:39.880]  Yeah, you're never having a baby again when you take this.
[15:39.880 --> 15:43.400]  And the thing is they're going to commit this mass crime and have the nurses and the doctors
[15:43.400 --> 15:44.400]  all signed on to it.
[15:44.400 --> 15:49.400]  So when it turns out millions have been sterilized and millions die slowly, everyone will enjoy
[15:49.400 --> 15:53.240]  it on the cover up and the Nazis call that the cement of blood.
[15:53.240 --> 16:08.080]  They'll now be corrupted and follow any order.
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.560]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone.
[16:12.560 --> 16:15.920]  Simply go to band.video with your safari browser.
[16:15.920 --> 16:19.200]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[16:19.200 --> 16:22.680]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[16:22.680 --> 16:24.760]  We'll then ask you to name the app.
[16:24.760 --> 16:27.020]  I suggest band.video.
[16:27.020 --> 16:31.600]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[16:31.600 --> 16:32.600]  to stop it.
[16:32.600 --> 16:36.760]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[16:36.760 --> 16:40.960]  have the app and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[16:40.960 --> 16:44.960]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[16:44.960 --> 16:47.640]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[16:47.640 --> 16:57.640]  However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[16:57.640 --> 17:00.640]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would.
[17:00.640 --> 17:04.480]  They've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse.
[17:04.480 --> 17:10.600]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for second term on January 20th,
[17:10.600 --> 17:14.320]  the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic.
[17:14.320 --> 17:16.400]  They are going to explode gas prices.
[17:16.400 --> 17:18.520]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants.
[17:18.520 --> 17:22.360]  They're going to cut off the energy source to the U.S., so it's impossible for factories
[17:22.360 --> 17:23.600]  to move back here.
[17:23.600 --> 17:24.600]  This is economic domination.
[17:24.600 --> 17:26.480]  This is economic war.
[17:26.480 --> 17:27.480]  We are being consolidated.
[17:27.480 --> 17:28.480]  We are being taken over.
[17:28.480 --> 17:32.120]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[17:32.120 --> 17:37.000]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.560]  to heel and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[17:41.560 --> 17:43.320]  This is a monopolistic takeover.
[17:43.320 --> 17:47.320]  That's what the great reset is, Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it.
[17:47.320 --> 17:51.680]  That's what social distancing is, so your business is only at 25 percent for several
[17:51.680 --> 17:52.680]  more years.
[17:52.680 --> 17:54.840]  No small businesses will be there.
[17:54.840 --> 18:00.120]  This is a master plan, say no.
[18:00.120 --> 18:26.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:26.120 --> 18:40.920]  There are a lot of great versions of this song, but listeners keep bringing it up.
[18:40.920 --> 18:41.920]  It seems to be a theme.
[18:41.920 --> 18:44.320]  So here's one of the best, I think.
[18:44.320 --> 18:47.840]  The Army Band, the Navy Band, they're all great without the lyrics, but I think Johnny
[18:47.840 --> 18:52.120]  Cash does a great job with it, so let's play it and we'll go to your phone calls.
[18:52.120 --> 19:02.120]  I have seen him in the watch fire of a hundred circling camps.
[19:02.120 --> 19:15.120]  They have filled it him and all through in the evening, due to death, I can be his right
[19:15.120 --> 19:16.120]  to say.
[19:16.120 --> 19:26.120]  Now here's the key coming up.
[19:26.120 --> 19:40.120]  He has sounded for the trumpet that shall never call retreat.
[19:40.120 --> 19:45.120]  He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat.
[19:45.120 --> 19:46.120]  This is the test, folks.
[19:46.120 --> 19:47.120]  Listen to this.
[19:47.120 --> 19:52.120]  He has sounded for the trumpet.
[19:52.120 --> 20:19.120]  He has sounded for the trumpet that shall never call retreat.
[20:19.120 --> 20:48.120]  He has sounded for the trumpet that shall never call retreat.
[20:48.120 --> 21:14.120]  He has sounded for the trumpet that shall never call retreat.
[21:14.120 --> 21:20.120]  I got close, we probably took 50 calls on the morning show I did, so we got six minutes
[21:20.120 --> 21:21.120]  to break right now.
[21:21.120 --> 21:23.120]  Let's go to PB in Rhode Island.
[21:23.120 --> 21:24.120]  You're on the air.
[21:24.120 --> 21:25.120]  Go ahead.
[21:25.120 --> 21:29.120]  Alex, thank you for taking my call and thank you for everything you do.
[21:29.120 --> 21:30.120]  Thank you, brother.
[21:30.120 --> 21:32.120]  I just got a question for you.
[21:32.120 --> 21:37.120]  As far as the communist Chinese leaks of over two million communist Chinese agents, pretty
[21:37.120 --> 21:42.120]  much the least around the world, there was a list of 20 United States governors on that
[21:42.120 --> 21:43.120]  list.
[21:43.120 --> 21:48.120]  I just want to know what you think of that and how come it hasn't really gained as much
[21:48.120 --> 21:49.120]  traction in the media?
[21:49.120 --> 21:51.120]  Because the mainstream media is sold out to the chai comms.
[21:51.120 --> 21:55.120]  I mean, that's what I've been telling everybody forever, and now it's come out that we are
[21:55.120 --> 21:59.120]  overrun by communist Chinese because they're not held by our laws.
[21:59.120 --> 22:00.120]  We hardly arrest them.
[22:00.120 --> 22:01.120]  We don't execute them.
[22:01.120 --> 22:03.120]  And so the Democrats are bought and paid for.
[22:03.120 --> 22:05.120]  A lot of Republicans, Mitch McConnell's paid for.
[22:05.120 --> 22:08.120]  The Georgia governor's paid for, I'm sad to say.
[22:08.120 --> 22:09.120]  And so we got our ass kicked.
[22:09.120 --> 22:10.120]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[22:10.120 --> 22:13.120]  Right now, China is kicking our ass.
[22:13.120 --> 22:16.120]  And our champion that dared fight them has had an election stolen.
[22:16.120 --> 22:17.120]  It's about to be thrown out.
[22:17.120 --> 22:19.120]  They'll probably throw Trump in prison.
[22:19.120 --> 22:20.120]  They're coming after me, too.
[22:20.120 --> 22:22.120]  They've got FBI agents following us around CIA.
[22:22.120 --> 22:23.120]  They look at us.
[22:23.120 --> 22:24.120]  They hate us.
[22:24.120 --> 22:25.120]  They love China.
[22:25.120 --> 22:27.120]  They love destroying America.
[22:27.120 --> 22:31.120]  Now, the average FBI agent didn't like that, but they've got special units that are literally
[22:31.120 --> 22:32.120]  taking this country down.
[22:32.120 --> 22:33.120]  It's bad, brother.
[22:33.120 --> 22:38.120]  I mean, I live in the state and, you know, it's a democratic crap hole.
[22:38.120 --> 22:43.120]  But I just, what could I do going forward to resist this?
[22:43.120 --> 22:47.120]  Realize we're in an occupied country and don't support any of them and just speak out against
[22:47.120 --> 22:51.120]  them and point out the depression we're going to live under and the tyranny and the shutdown
[22:51.120 --> 22:53.120]  is because people didn't stand up against this.
[22:53.120 --> 22:54.120]  God bless you.
[22:54.120 --> 22:55.120]  I appreciate your call.
[22:55.120 --> 22:56.120]  John and Tennessee, go ahead.
[22:56.120 --> 22:57.120]  You're on the air.
[22:57.120 --> 23:00.120]  Hey, thanks for calling me back.
[23:00.120 --> 23:01.120]  You bet, brother.
[23:01.120 --> 23:02.120]  Go ahead.
[23:02.120 --> 23:07.120]  Yeah, I wanted to know your thoughts on the creation of a new party like the Patriot Party.
[23:07.120 --> 23:09.120]  Could something like that actually work?
[23:09.120 --> 23:12.120]  And who would you want to see in leadership and stuff like that?
[23:12.120 --> 23:15.120]  Well, you know, a lot of people call it America first.
[23:15.120 --> 23:18.120]  I just call it America party, America existing.
[23:18.120 --> 23:22.120]  How about the nation party, the national party?
[23:22.120 --> 23:26.120]  Because globalism doesn't want us to even exist.
[23:26.120 --> 23:31.120]  You know, the people's party, the populist party, the populist party for an American future.
[23:31.120 --> 23:37.120]  And I think it's absolutely needed to like get Democrats that want to wake up and Republicans
[23:37.120 --> 23:38.120]  that do as well.
[23:38.120 --> 23:43.120]  So you can have Republicans that run saying they've signed on to the America populist
[23:43.120 --> 23:44.120]  movement.
[23:44.120 --> 23:48.120]  And so I think it can be something where we demanded a both parties and then they affiliate
[23:48.120 --> 23:51.120]  with it as we build the party itself.
[23:51.120 --> 23:52.120]  Right.
[23:52.120 --> 23:56.120]  Maybe like Rand Paul or Governor DeSantis and Florida.
[23:56.120 --> 23:57.120]  Exactly.
[23:57.120 --> 23:58.120]  They should be.
[23:58.120 --> 24:02.120]  Rand Paul to be president, vice president, I don't care who just common sense, be a
[24:02.120 --> 24:06.120]  be a person for the country, be a person for prosperity, be a person for security.
[24:06.120 --> 24:08.120]  We just want to be our country.
[24:08.120 --> 24:10.120]  We don't want to be under globalist control.
[24:10.120 --> 24:14.120]  And you say that as bad as globalism is going to get, it's going to be the most popular
[24:14.120 --> 24:18.120]  thing ever, just like the Brexit party, but on steroids.
[24:18.120 --> 24:19.120]  Right.
[24:19.120 --> 24:21.120]  Thank you so much.
[24:21.120 --> 24:22.120]  God bless you.
[24:22.120 --> 24:25.120]  Yeah, as bad as this is, folks, and I got to tell you, we've been kicking globalist
[24:25.120 --> 24:31.120]  ass, you have been so well, they're so scared that they've got a fire lit under their commie
[24:31.120 --> 24:37.120]  ass, their little devil ass, their little fork tails on fire to come after us if Biden
[24:37.120 --> 24:39.120]  gets in, but it is sick level.
[24:39.120 --> 24:40.120]  That's almost better.
[24:40.120 --> 24:42.120]  It's going to destroy them forever.
[24:42.120 --> 24:46.120]  The right thing to do is to put Trump in the right thing to do is try to fix things nicely,
[24:46.120 --> 24:50.120]  but any way you slice it, as long as we don't give up, we don't lose.
[24:50.120 --> 24:52.120]  And I don't say that to feel good.
[24:52.120 --> 24:55.120]  I'll probably end up getting put in prison or killed.
[24:55.120 --> 24:56.120]  I don't say that to act tough.
[24:56.120 --> 24:58.120]  They've let me know, but it doesn't matter.
[24:58.120 --> 25:03.120]  At the end of the day, I'll be with Jesus and next level, my children and grandchildren
[25:03.120 --> 25:04.120]  will be free.
[25:04.120 --> 25:06.120]  So I'm not sacrificing.
[25:06.120 --> 25:07.120]  I love it.
[25:07.120 --> 25:09.120]  I am thankful for this.
[25:09.120 --> 25:10.120]  God Almighty.
[25:10.120 --> 25:15.120]  I can't believe the position I've been put in the honor of this to be in this position
[25:15.120 --> 25:19.120]  with all of you great people for every race, color and creed with red blood and to be standing
[25:19.120 --> 25:21.120]  against these pedophile Satanists.
[25:21.120 --> 25:27.120]  By the way, you've seen a bunch of the pedophile Satanists running their own kidnapping rings
[25:27.120 --> 25:31.120]  that work for Epstein and the Clintons arrested in France, arrested in Canada.
[25:31.120 --> 25:32.120]  There have been more arrests.
[25:32.120 --> 25:37.120]  So let me tell you, I don't ever want to be over positive, but now I see Trump going
[25:37.120 --> 25:42.120]  after the globalist and I see all these arrests happening and I see them canceling Biden's
[25:42.120 --> 25:47.120]  military briefings and it tells me Trump's getting ready to drop the hammer.
[25:47.120 --> 25:50.120]  And I was told something about Trump.
[25:50.120 --> 25:56.120]  I'm not going to say whether I heard it from Trump or Roger Stone, but they told me when
[25:56.120 --> 26:02.120]  he was president elect four plus years ago that Trump expected this to come down to this.
[26:02.120 --> 26:09.120]  And so look, I'm just telling the New World Order.
[26:09.120 --> 26:11.120]  If you're looking for trouble, you came to the right place.
[26:11.120 --> 26:13.120]  We're not looking to start a fight.
[26:13.120 --> 26:16.120]  But if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[26:16.120 --> 26:20.120]  You think threatening us and following us around does anything and I know your bosses
[26:20.120 --> 26:21.120]  told you come do it.
[26:21.120 --> 26:23.120]  Listen, I'm a lot more worried about God.
[26:23.120 --> 26:27.120]  In fact, you don't even show up on a registration scale for me.
[26:27.120 --> 26:28.120]  Fear wise.
[26:28.120 --> 26:33.120]  You don't even, my boss is my boss and that's who I take orders from.
[26:33.120 --> 26:37.120]  His name is Jesus Christ and his father is the controller of the universe.
[26:37.120 --> 26:42.120]  So that's why I'm taking orders from and the more you push, the more strength I'm
[26:42.120 --> 26:44.120]  given from my father.
[26:44.120 --> 26:46.120]  Well, they're right back.
[26:46.120 --> 26:47.120]  Stay with us.
[26:47.120 --> 26:56.120]  Your phone calls and the latest news on this straight ahead.
[26:56.120 --> 27:00.120]  During our war for independence during some of the darkest days, Thomas Jefferson, the
[27:00.120 --> 27:04.120]  man credited with writing our Declaration of Independence and much of our Constitution
[27:04.120 --> 27:06.120]  later said, look, this is not going to be an easy fight.
[27:06.120 --> 27:10.120]  We're not going to be transported to Liberty on a bed of feathers.
[27:10.120 --> 27:15.120]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we've actually had incredible successes with Donald Trump and
[27:15.120 --> 27:18.120]  Bolsonaro and the Liberty movement worldwide.
[27:18.120 --> 27:22.120]  We're going to have major setbacks, but there is a giant awakening happening.
[27:22.120 --> 27:25.120]  That's what the Globals have gone ahead and launched their great reset.
[27:25.120 --> 27:29.120]  Global collapse, worldwide social credit score, tracking app, microchip, forced
[27:29.120 --> 27:33.120]  modulation takeover now because if they don't force it now, they're never going to
[27:33.120 --> 27:34.120]  get it.
[27:34.120 --> 27:36.120]  So in full words, never been more critical.
[27:36.120 --> 27:39.120]  I want to thank you all for your support and I want to encourage you to do your Christmas

[27:54.120 --> 27:55.120]  Hey, Steve.
[27:55.120 --> 27:56.120]  How you doing?
[27:56.120 --> 27:57.120]  Hey, Alex.
[27:57.120 --> 27:58.120]  Oh my God.
[27:58.120 --> 28:01.120]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[28:01.120 --> 28:04.120]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[28:04.120 --> 28:08.120]  I went to VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until June and I kept here
[28:08.120 --> 28:11.120]  in Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[28:11.120 --> 28:13.120]  Let me tell you something, man.
[28:13.120 --> 28:18.120]  I had an internal digestive problem and I stumbled with it for about five or six years and the
[28:18.120 --> 28:20.120]  doctors, they tried every test.
[28:20.120 --> 28:22.120]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[28:22.120 --> 28:25.120]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[28:25.120 --> 28:26.120]  you know what?
[28:26.120 --> 28:28.120]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[28:28.120 --> 28:31.120]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that
[28:31.120 --> 28:33.120]  stuff, but I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[28:33.120 --> 28:34.120]  I got it.
[28:34.120 --> 28:35.120]  I hid it from the nurses.
[28:35.120 --> 28:37.120]  I started taking it, man.
[28:37.120 --> 28:38.120]  I've changed my life.
[28:38.120 --> 28:39.120]  It saved my life.
[28:39.120 --> 28:42.120]  If there's any veteran out there, I don't give you travel though.
[28:42.120 --> 28:47.120]  Anybody who's traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that
[28:47.120 --> 28:48.120]  living defense.
[28:48.120 --> 28:49.120]  It's true, folks.
[28:49.120 --> 28:54.120]  We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality and living defense is over the top
[28:54.120 --> 28:55.120]  good.
[28:55.120 --> 28:57.120]  M4store.com.
[28:57.120 --> 29:00.120]  Just in time for Christmas, one of our best sellers sold out for months.

[29:54.120 --> 30:03.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[30:03.120 --> 30:12.120]  I'm working on the weekend again.
[30:12.120 --> 30:16.120]  Yeah, I'm here in the deep end.
[30:16.120 --> 30:19.120]  Working on the weekend like usual.
[30:19.120 --> 30:22.120]  Way off in the deep end like usual.
[30:22.120 --> 30:24.120]  It's where they passed us.
[30:24.120 --> 30:25.120]  They doing too much.
[30:25.120 --> 30:27.120]  Haven't done my taxes.
[30:27.120 --> 30:28.120]  I'm too turned up.
[30:28.120 --> 30:31.120]  Virgil got a paddock on my wrist going nuts.
[30:31.120 --> 30:34.120]  Caught me slipping once okay so what?
[30:34.120 --> 30:35.120]  Someone hit your block up.
[30:35.120 --> 30:37.120]  I tell you if it was us.
[30:37.120 --> 30:40.120]  Man, a house in Rosewood, it too plush.
[30:40.120 --> 30:43.120]  Stay my days a number, but I keep waking up.
[30:43.120 --> 30:46.120]  No, you see my text, baby, please say something.
[30:46.120 --> 30:47.120]  Wine by the glass, man.
[30:47.120 --> 30:49.120]  I'm Chiefscape, huh?
[30:49.120 --> 30:52.120]  Gotta move on my release day, huh?
[30:52.120 --> 30:54.120]  This is fame, not clout.
[30:54.120 --> 30:56.120]  I don't even know what that's about.
[30:56.120 --> 30:58.120]  Watch your mouth, baby.
[30:58.120 --> 31:00.120]  Got an ego twice the size of the crib.
[31:00.120 --> 31:03.120]  I can never tell if it is what it is.
[31:03.120 --> 31:06.120]  But said what I had to and did what I did.
[31:06.120 --> 31:09.120]  Never turned my back on every gig I forbid.
[31:09.120 --> 31:12.120]  Virgil got a paddock on my wrist doing front flips.
[31:12.120 --> 31:15.120]  Giving you my number, but don't hit me on the gun.
[31:15.120 --> 31:18.120]  Working on the weekend like usual.
[31:18.120 --> 31:21.120]  Way off in the deep end like usual.
[31:21.120 --> 31:22.120]  Swear they passed us.
[31:22.120 --> 31:24.120]  They doing too much.
[31:24.120 --> 31:25.120]  Haven't done my taxes.
[31:25.120 --> 31:27.120]  I'm too turned up.
[31:27.120 --> 31:29.120]  Virgil got a paddock on my wrist going nuts.
[31:29.120 --> 31:30.120]  I'm taking a lot of them.
[31:30.120 --> 31:31.120]  Call me slipping once okay.
[31:31.120 --> 31:33.120]  And then I'm not going to cover this news the next hour
[31:33.120 --> 31:35.120]  because there's more coming in.
[31:35.120 --> 31:37.120]  I want to really tell you what I think.
[31:37.120 --> 31:41.120]  In the back of my brain, I'm still percolating what's happening.
[31:41.120 --> 31:44.120]  But...
[31:44.120 --> 31:46.120]  Trump's going to make a run at him.
[31:46.120 --> 31:50.120]  I mean, that's the bottom line.
[31:50.120 --> 31:52.120]  And I've talked to really serious people.
[31:52.120 --> 31:54.120]  A lot of them at the Pentagon.
[31:54.120 --> 31:58.120]  And they're all very excited and are going to make a run at them.
[31:58.120 --> 32:01.120]  And they're getting the hearings ready to give them the political backing
[32:01.120 --> 32:02.120]  for what they need to do.
[32:02.120 --> 32:04.120]  They're already rating facilities.
[32:04.120 --> 32:06.120]  It really is happening.
[32:06.120 --> 32:10.120]  And right here in Austin, the raids did happen in Germany.
[32:10.120 --> 32:13.120]  And let's just say this country is fighting for its life right now.
[32:13.120 --> 32:22.120]  And with 33 days left, we should see some big action the next week.
[32:22.120 --> 32:24.120]  The next two weeks.
[32:24.120 --> 32:26.120]  Because you can't put Joe Biden in.
[32:26.120 --> 32:28.120]  He's such a Communist Chinese agent.
[32:28.120 --> 32:31.120]  So I've said a thousand times, even if he'd won the election.
[32:31.120 --> 32:34.120]  And if he did, I'd say, hey, he looks like he won it.
[32:34.120 --> 32:35.120]  He's still a Communist agent.
[32:35.120 --> 32:36.120]  He's got to be removed.
[32:36.120 --> 32:39.120]  You've got to put another Democrat in that isn't a Communist Chinese agent.
[32:39.120 --> 32:41.120]  But he didn't win it.
[32:41.120 --> 32:42.120]  And he's a Communist Chinese agent.
[32:42.120 --> 32:43.120]  It's a fraud.
[32:43.120 --> 32:48.120]  And I've told my sources, well, they think, what do you think the best thing is?
[32:48.120 --> 32:51.120]  I'm like, well, this obviously, you're not trying to set me up to put me in president
[32:51.120 --> 32:53.120]  because I don't want to say who should be targeted.
[32:53.120 --> 32:57.120]  And I'm not trying to push that.
[32:57.120 --> 33:00.120]  You call for a new election once you've had congressional hearings and you show the fraud
[33:00.120 --> 33:03.120]  and you bring out all the dirt on Biden and his family.
[33:03.120 --> 33:05.120]  And you release everything you got on the Clintons, the Obamas,
[33:05.120 --> 33:08.120]  and you just flame throw them all no matter what they bring out on Republicans.
[33:08.120 --> 33:13.120]  The Afriam was stuff so powerful, the presidents are giving nightly, resolute death speeches.
[33:13.120 --> 33:18.120]  I would say by now, weeks ago, maybe Trump's smarter than I am.
[33:18.120 --> 33:20.120]  Hell, he ran for president one the first time.
[33:20.120 --> 33:22.120]  He's got some smart people behind him.
[33:22.120 --> 33:29.120]  I know Colonel Jackson said, you don't fire until you see the lights in their eyes.
[33:29.120 --> 33:32.120]  They had to sit there behind their hay bales and behind their logs.
[33:32.120 --> 33:36.120]  When the British were shooting at them at 200 yards, 100 yards of those old rifles,
[33:36.120 --> 33:42.120]  they just waited until they were 20 yards away or less.
[33:42.120 --> 33:46.120]  And love that intel to the lights of the eyes.
[33:46.120 --> 33:50.120]  That's an original rangefinder, absolutely scientific.
[33:50.120 --> 33:52.120]  See how smart all those old sayings were?
[33:52.120 --> 33:54.120]  Using words for technology to understand.
[33:54.120 --> 34:00.120]  Don't shoot a rangefinder out, shoot them at 20 yards when you see the lights in their eyes.
[34:00.120 --> 34:05.120]  When you see the lights in their eyes, shoot them right in the chest.
[34:05.120 --> 34:10.120]  And I'm not saying that physically.
[34:10.120 --> 34:17.120]  I'm talking about Trump as an allegory, waiting until they're right up on us.
[34:17.120 --> 34:24.120]  So that we're reloaded politically with the truth, with the justice, with the liberty, with the facts, with the evidence.
[34:24.120 --> 34:26.120]  But it looks bad waiting this long.
[34:26.120 --> 34:28.120]  For McConnell to roll over, be a CHICOM agent.
[34:28.120 --> 34:31.120]  The Supreme Court to roll over, be CHICOM agents.
[34:31.120 --> 34:35.120]  To have Roberts screaming and yelling and saying, the Democrats will burn America.
[34:35.120 --> 34:41.120]  So we're all scared of Trump's martial law to counter their martial law.
[34:41.120 --> 34:50.120]  But we got the justice, the deposed Chief Justice saying, we can't do this
[34:50.120 --> 34:56.120]  because if we do screaming at the other justices who all crapped their pants and got in line, the other eight.
[34:56.120 --> 34:59.120]  That's in the news now.
[34:59.120 --> 35:04.120]  Incredible sources, congressmen, sources, the aides, talk to their aides.
[35:04.120 --> 35:06.120]  And he pistol wept them.
[35:06.120 --> 35:09.120]  He screamed at them for hours.
[35:09.120 --> 35:11.120]  That they'll be riots.
[35:11.120 --> 35:15.120]  Because that's what black lives matter in $10.6 billion of BS was.
[35:15.120 --> 35:20.120]  That somehow if Trump got in, we'll have all the black people riot working for George Soros.
[35:20.120 --> 35:23.120]  And that'll be their cover that Trump's against black people.
[35:23.120 --> 35:26.120]  Exactly what I told you for a year in the buildup.
[35:26.120 --> 35:32.120]  That's the economy.
[35:32.120 --> 35:35.120]  And so now that's where we are.
[35:35.120 --> 35:38.120]  Let's go to your phone calls right now.
[35:38.120 --> 35:43.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joshua in Michigan.
[35:43.120 --> 35:44.120]  Joshua, thank you.
[35:44.120 --> 35:46.120]  Then we'll go to Heather and many others.
[35:46.120 --> 35:47.120]  Go ahead.
[35:47.120 --> 35:48.120]  Hey, Alex.
[35:48.120 --> 35:49.120]  How you doing?
[35:49.120 --> 35:50.120]  Hey, two things.
[35:50.120 --> 35:51.120]  COVID.
[35:51.120 --> 36:03.120]  I was watching a focus on the family this morning and they had two Nazi scientists on pushing the COVID vaccine and talking about regular vaccine vaccines and aborted babies.
[36:03.120 --> 36:05.120]  It's completely disgusting.
[36:05.120 --> 36:09.120]  It would broke my heart and the two guys on there were just just loving it.
[36:09.120 --> 36:10.120]  I know Mike Pence.
[36:10.120 --> 36:11.120]  Praise those guys earlier today.
[36:11.120 --> 36:13.120]  I wouldn't.
[36:13.120 --> 36:22.120]  And as far as Mike Pence is speaking evangelical, I believe they said he got the Pfizer mRNA thing that's made out of cloned baby tissue.
[36:22.120 --> 36:25.120]  So Mike Pence doesn't just support the killing of babies.
[36:25.120 --> 36:27.120]  He now injects them into himself.
[36:27.120 --> 36:28.120]  Yeah, it's disgusting.
[36:28.120 --> 36:30.120]  It's satanic and Luciferian.
[36:30.120 --> 36:36.120]  The other thing is, I definitely support Trump's martial law, whatever it may be.
[36:36.120 --> 36:42.120]  I'm 15 years, but in the military, eight years active duty, six years in the reserves.
[36:42.120 --> 36:43.120]  You know, I support it.
[36:43.120 --> 36:46.120]  The sad thing is, is I don't know how many Americans will.
[36:46.120 --> 36:53.120]  I got a church and the pastor's telling us we better be thankful for COVID lockdowns, wearing our diapers.
[36:53.120 --> 36:56.120]  I'm like the only guy there not wearing diaper on my face.
[36:56.120 --> 36:59.120]  Everyone else is just, I just, it's unreal.
[36:59.120 --> 37:02.120]  I don't know if it's just they're like brainwashed or whatever.
[37:02.120 --> 37:04.120]  But it's a group thing and most people are followers.
[37:04.120 --> 37:08.120]  It's up to you to talk to the preacher or ask to speak in front of the church and show the studies.
[37:08.120 --> 37:13.120]  But, you know, I hear you, but, but again, we're already under a globalist form of martial law.
[37:13.120 --> 37:14.120]  So what do we call this?
[37:14.120 --> 37:18.120]  We need a national emergency to throw off the communist controllers.
[37:18.120 --> 37:19.120]  I mean, what do we do?
[37:19.120 --> 37:22.120]  If not, they will be in full control.
[37:22.120 --> 37:23.120]  No, I know.
[37:23.120 --> 37:27.120]  And what I'm going to do is not, you know, the military come down with the vaccine, not going to do it.
[37:27.120 --> 37:28.120]  I'm walking away.
[37:28.120 --> 37:29.120]  What do I care?
[37:29.120 --> 37:31.120]  There's a pension who gives a crap.
[37:31.120 --> 37:35.120]  And then the second thing, you know, I'm going to be there on the 20th with you guys.
[37:35.120 --> 37:43.120]  And if they managed to put this communist, this dead guy and Joe Biden, I'm done.
[37:43.120 --> 37:44.120]  I'm not.
[37:44.120 --> 37:45.120]  It's not.
[37:45.120 --> 37:52.120]  I have an oath to the Constitution, to you, a covenant with the American people to uphold and defend against enemies,
[37:52.120 --> 37:53.120]  foreign and domestic.
[37:53.120 --> 37:55.120]  And it's where we're 360.
[37:55.120 --> 37:58.120]  So I think we just have to dig in.
[37:58.120 --> 38:00.120]  And I totally agree with you.
[38:00.120 --> 38:02.120]  God bless you, sir, from Michigan.
[38:02.120 --> 38:04.120]  They're breaking the social contract.
[38:04.120 --> 38:06.120]  They're bringing in world government.
[38:06.120 --> 38:09.120]  They're trying to forcefully inoculate us or telling us small businesses are not essential.
[38:09.120 --> 38:11.120]  The churches need to stay closed.
[38:11.120 --> 38:12.120]  All right.
[38:12.120 --> 38:13.120]  Let's take another call.
[38:13.120 --> 38:14.120]  Scott in Texas.
[38:14.120 --> 38:15.120]  Thanks for holding.
[38:15.120 --> 38:16.120]  Go ahead, Scott.
[38:16.120 --> 38:19.120]  Man, I'm just watching that Mike Pence get that shot.
[38:19.120 --> 38:20.120]  Unbelievable.
[38:20.120 --> 38:23.120]  He would put a boarded fetus in his cell.
[38:23.120 --> 38:24.120]  Sorry.
[38:24.120 --> 38:32.120]  Well, not as the boarded fetus is the entire genome of a baby boy killed in 1966 that they'd
[38:32.120 --> 38:39.120]  been recloning satanically the entire human genome of him so that when that boy's DNA hits his cells,
[38:39.120 --> 38:41.120]  they take the orders.
[38:41.120 --> 38:43.120]  And by the way, they tested millions of dead kids.
[38:43.120 --> 38:46.120]  They don't know why it's that particular kid they kill.
[38:46.120 --> 38:50.120]  Like there was a black lady died of cancer in 1954, I think.
[38:50.120 --> 38:51.120]  Look it up.
[38:51.120 --> 38:52.120]  Look up immortal cell lines.
[38:52.120 --> 38:54.120]  They don't know why her cells are better than anybody's.
[38:54.120 --> 38:57.120]  But her cells work when they add it to anything to deliver it to you.
[38:57.120 --> 38:59.120]  Oh, I'm going to come back to you, Scott.
[38:59.120 --> 39:00.120]  Stay there.
[39:00.120 --> 39:01.120]  I'm not going to cut you off.
[39:01.120 --> 39:02.120]  I'm going to come back to him.
[39:02.120 --> 39:03.120]  I'm not kidding.
[39:03.120 --> 39:06.120]  It was a black lady died of a cancer that she got, you know, one week.
[39:06.120 --> 39:08.120]  It killed her like in a week and a half.
[39:08.120 --> 39:09.120]  And it like ate her whole body.
[39:09.120 --> 39:10.120]  It was like a blob.
[39:10.120 --> 39:12.120]  It was like, they were like, what is this?
[39:12.120 --> 39:13.120]  The way like she got it.
[39:13.120 --> 39:15.120]  And I put it like a year.
[39:15.120 --> 39:16.120]  And they went, what is it?
[39:16.120 --> 39:20.120]  So they put it under a microscope and they could put it in a Petri dish for 20 years.
[39:20.120 --> 39:21.120]  It doesn't die.
[39:21.120 --> 39:23.120]  One cell doesn't need oxygen.
[39:23.120 --> 39:24.120]  Doesn't need anything.
[39:24.120 --> 39:26.120]  It's like a zombie.
[39:26.120 --> 39:31.120]  And they took that lady's jeans and they've put it into everything.
[39:31.120 --> 39:32.120]  I mean, wow.
[39:32.120 --> 39:37.120]  But then meanwhile, um, fact check vaccine while vaccines contain human DNA.
[39:37.120 --> 39:39.120]  There's no link to cancer or autism.
[39:39.120 --> 39:40.120]  Oh yeah.
[39:40.120 --> 39:42.120]  They say whatever.
[39:42.120 --> 39:43.120]  Yep.
[39:43.120 --> 39:47.120]  They got a dead white kid from 66 and a dead black lady from the early 50s.
[39:47.120 --> 39:51.120]  And they built everything off their genetics and they just keep injecting us with them
[39:51.120 --> 39:54.120]  and cloning their cells and cloning them over and over again.
[39:54.120 --> 40:00.120]  The U.S. Postal Service tells Info Wars that as long as you get your order in by December 18th
[40:00.120 --> 40:05.120]  and we're able to ship it out by that day, you will get it anywhere in the United States before Christmas.
[40:05.120 --> 40:06.120]  But listen, don't wait.
[40:06.120 --> 40:08.120]  Do your shopping at infowarstore.com.
[40:08.120 --> 40:11.120]  Get great products and fund the Info War.
[40:11.120 --> 40:16.120]  Now at the most critical time, not just at Info Wars history, but this country's history.
[40:16.120 --> 40:18.120]  You have invested in Info Wars.
[40:18.120 --> 40:19.120]  You've prayed for us.
[40:19.120 --> 40:20.120]  You've spread the word.
[40:20.120 --> 40:21.120]  You've bought the products.
[40:21.120 --> 40:27.120]  And you've gotten the benefits of the information warfare of the truth in the fight against the globalist.
[40:27.120 --> 40:32.120]  But now is the time to redouble all our efforts in praying for a great awakening which is starting to happen
[40:32.120 --> 40:37.120]  and spreading the word about infowars.com, newswars.com, and band.video.
[40:37.120 --> 40:42.120]  And at the very same time, buying amazing products at infowarstore.com.
[40:42.120 --> 40:45.120]  They have some of the biggest sales, if not the biggest of the year,
[40:45.120 --> 40:50.120]  certainly on some items, the biggest sales of the year on nutraceuticals, you name it, at infowarstore.com.
[40:50.120 --> 40:53.120]  So thanks for your support, get those orders in, and God bless.
[41:21.120 --> 41:28.120]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three months.
[41:28.120 --> 41:29.120]  Okay?
[41:29.120 --> 41:34.120]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[41:34.120 --> 41:36.120]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[41:36.120 --> 41:37.120]  These are real numbers.
[41:37.120 --> 41:38.120]  These are real facts.
[41:38.120 --> 41:41.120]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses,
[41:41.120 --> 41:43.120]  never come out and are taught we're not essential.
[41:43.120 --> 41:46.120]  All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[41:46.120 --> 41:48.120]  Rebuke it, stand up against it.
[41:48.120 --> 41:50.120]  This is slavery.
[41:50.120 --> 42:19.120]  It is not something you could pull up with and survive.
[42:20.120 --> 42:23.120]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[42:23.120 --> 42:26.120]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[42:26.120 --> 42:28.120]  It is making the population poor.
[42:28.120 --> 42:34.120]  By designs, we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[42:34.120 --> 42:39.120]  They're destroying civilization, rebuild it in their dystopic image.
[42:39.120 --> 42:43.120]  We are fighting this at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com.
[42:43.120 --> 42:45.120]  We are fighting for a pro-human future.
[42:45.120 --> 42:50.120]  And we need you to get the facts, to research and share with others and join the fight.
[42:50.120 --> 42:51.120]  God bless you.
[42:51.120 --> 43:20.120]  Visit us at infowars.com.
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.120]  To Madity with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[43:25.120 --> 43:31.120]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses
[43:31.120 --> 43:36.120]  were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems.
[43:36.120 --> 43:41.120]  Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines.
[43:41.120 --> 43:43.120]  And then remember, you've been warned.
[43:43.120 --> 43:46.120]  This is the equivalent of an alien takeover.
[43:46.120 --> 43:49.120]  Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men,
[43:49.120 --> 43:53.120]  the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us.
[43:53.120 --> 44:22.120]  That's all the same in the end.
[44:23.120 --> 44:29.120]  I'm going to go to your phone calls right now.
[44:29.120 --> 44:37.120]  And then next hour, I'm going to hit the huge news of the counter strike by Trump and the patriots that is unfolding.
[44:37.120 --> 44:41.120]  I wasn't ready to give up the last week, but I was telling you it looked dire.
[44:41.120 --> 44:46.120]  We didn't see some major action, an action from the president.
[44:46.120 --> 44:48.120]  But let me tell you, it is happening now.
[44:48.120 --> 44:53.120]  All these senators, all these house members lining up for criminal investigations, for hearings,
[44:53.120 --> 45:02.120]  state legislatures finding fraud, Georgia saying they're going to go through and check all of the signatures.
[45:02.120 --> 45:05.120]  There is just so much unfolding right now.
[45:05.120 --> 45:09.120]  All the things that Trump's been pushing for are now suddenly happening.
[45:09.120 --> 45:13.120]  I don't want to give false hope, but let me tell you, Trump's moving in the right direction and moving quickly.
[45:13.120 --> 45:17.120]  So pray for President Trump, pray for a global awakening.
[45:17.120 --> 45:21.120]  We're 33, 34, depending on how you look at it, days out from inauguration.
[45:21.120 --> 45:23.120]  Scott in Texas, start over.
[45:23.120 --> 45:36.120]  We're talking about Operation Warp Speed, the so-called COVID vaccines that are really mutinogenic, DNA takeover systems like the movie The Thing.
[45:36.120 --> 45:43.120]  Yeah, and it seems like they're doing that just so they can get a patent on it.
[45:43.120 --> 45:52.120]  My question was, in Operation Warp Speed, is there anything in there that nullifies the Nuremberg Trials and Geneva Convention Treaty?
[45:52.120 --> 46:00.120]  No, it all violates it, but they've got a bill introduced that Republicans are supporting too, because they're not scientists, they're just idiot lawyers.
[46:00.120 --> 46:14.120]  HR4373 Engineering, Bio, Biology, Research and Development Act, 2019, and this is what they both want, is to say we're all a product, and when we take these products to take over our cells, they then claim that they own our cells.
[46:14.120 --> 46:17.120]  So this is the final frontier and it's happening now.
[46:17.120 --> 46:22.120]  This is the great reset, part one, reduced expectations and biotechno feudalism.
[46:22.120 --> 46:38.120]  Yeah, I watched Grand Theft World and you got brought up with Klaus and the great reset and they were saying you lost all 35,000 interviews when YouTube deleted your stuff and they were trying to move it over to their webpage.
[46:38.120 --> 46:39.120]  Well, I'm ignorant.
[46:39.120 --> 46:41.120]  What's Grand Theft Auto?
[46:41.120 --> 46:55.120]  No, Grand Theft World, they do a chronological podcast throughout the week and they put together all the articles for the week, like this one's Wolves and White Coats and they did a whole thing.
[46:55.120 --> 47:02.120]  They just go over every freedom fighter, like their podcast, they pull out clips and they put it all together.
[47:02.120 --> 47:11.120]  I love it, Wolves and White Coats instead of Wolves and Sheep's clothing, that's beautiful. All right, Scott, thank you so much, amazing points.
[47:11.120 --> 47:21.120]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to, is that all the original collars we didn't get to this morning that I called? Which one?
[47:21.120 --> 47:29.120]  Thomas from North Carolina, go ahead and thanks for letting us call you back when I didn't get to you during that new show we're doing, go ahead.
[47:29.120 --> 47:32.120]  It's an honor to speak with you, I appreciate you taking my call.
[47:32.120 --> 47:44.120]  I was reading something yesterday, it was a brief that somebody sent to my wife and it was about us, Cory Good talking about fear for martial law that we would know by Friday.
[47:44.120 --> 47:50.120]  And I heard you talking about Trump and then canceling all the Pentagon's beating.
[47:50.120 --> 48:00.120]  It was Biden's transition team and they were supposed to meet with somebody at like 3pm or something and it said we would know by Friday.
[48:00.120 --> 48:06.120]  Why? But this couple of days ago and I was just curious if maybe you could kind of elaborate on that a little bit.
[48:06.120 --> 48:09.120]  Well, I don't know who you were listening to, but they sure knew more than I did.
[48:09.120 --> 48:19.120]  Yeah, this is out of Axios, Bloomberg, all of it, acting pending on Chief Holt's Biden transition briefings, signaling that Trump is not going to concede and going to use the military.
[48:19.120 --> 48:28.120]  Clearly there was a foreign intelligence tie to these Dominion machines, goes back to China, Russia, Iran, Trump should re-vote these states.
[48:28.120 --> 48:30.120]  That's what they're all saying now.
[48:30.120 --> 48:41.120]  So Trump's doing an emergency meeting here it is from White House.gov today at 3.30 Eastern, that's 2.30 Central, so we'll be live on air during this.
[48:41.120 --> 48:49.120]  You'll be meeting with the Secretary of Defense about an anti-Chinese Communist task force here in the U.S. is the intel we've got.
[48:49.120 --> 48:56.120]  So Trump's getting ready to, it looks like he may have a new attorney general or somebody ready to arrest these Chinese spies and their minions.
[48:56.120 --> 48:58.120]  And all he's got to do is arrest a few of them.
[48:58.120 --> 49:01.120]  They'll all start singing like canaries.
[49:01.120 --> 49:10.120]  So will our military, will America, who the Globalist think are done, are we all that cowardly or will we stand up the Chinese Communist and stop their takeover?
[49:10.120 --> 49:12.120]  What do you think is going to happen?
[49:12.120 --> 49:15.120]  I hope and pray they don't get away with it.
[49:15.120 --> 49:22.120]  They think they have and they think they've done it clean, you know, but it's all coming to light and it's just like anything else in life.
[49:22.120 --> 49:24.120]  You do wrong, you do, you know, things like that.
[49:24.120 --> 49:26.120]  It always comes out in the end.
[49:26.120 --> 49:27.120]  Absolutely.
[49:27.120 --> 49:30.120]  Thomas, anything else?
[49:30.120 --> 49:31.120]  No, sir.
[49:31.120 --> 49:32.120]  I appreciate you taking my call.
[49:32.120 --> 49:33.120]  I appreciate everything you did there.
[49:33.120 --> 49:34.120]  I appreciate you, brother.
[49:34.120 --> 49:36.120]  Listen, I appreciate you.
[49:36.120 --> 49:37.120]  We're all in this together.
[49:37.120 --> 49:38.120]  You're just like I am.
[49:38.120 --> 49:42.120]  I don't care if you're white, black, old, young, Hispanic, Chinese, whoever.
[49:42.120 --> 49:48.120]  If you love freedom and you want to have a future, we are brothers and sisters together against this evil because make no mistake.
[49:48.120 --> 49:50.120]  These globalists are damn evil.
[49:50.120 --> 49:54.120]  They're now coming with a deadly program to reprogram your DNA.
[49:54.120 --> 49:56.120]  The Bible says it's a fallen entity.
[49:56.120 --> 50:01.120]  I don't get into UFOs and stuff, but that sounds to me like aliens are trying to take us over.
[50:01.120 --> 50:05.120]  I mean, because it takes over all your cells.
[50:05.120 --> 50:09.120]  See how just suddenly we're inside this crazy town.
[50:09.120 --> 50:11.120]  We're just suddenly inside the crazy town.
[50:11.120 --> 50:16.120]  All right, let's go in the order the calls are received.
[50:16.120 --> 50:18.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick in California.
[50:18.120 --> 50:19.120]  Nick, you're on the air.
[50:19.120 --> 50:20.120]  Welcome.
[50:20.120 --> 50:21.120]  Hey, Alex.
[50:21.120 --> 50:25.120]  Melissa T for 10 years, you woke me up with Obama deception.
[50:25.120 --> 50:35.120]  I want to really quickly talk about California.
[50:35.120 --> 50:38.120]  800,000 signatures in one of like a week, right?
[50:38.120 --> 50:41.120]  Yeah, we got an extension for three months.
[50:41.120 --> 50:43.120]  We have our own candidate that we're backing.
[50:43.120 --> 50:47.120]  So I guess it just now though kind of got some traction though.
[50:47.120 --> 50:49.120]  Yes, we got some traction now.
[50:49.120 --> 50:51.120]  We're going to a lot of big friction.
[50:51.120 --> 50:56.120]  We're going to be back with the four back conservatives that confronted BLM back months ago.
[50:56.120 --> 51:00.120]  I appreciate you that I'm one of those people that actually come in with them.
[51:00.120 --> 51:02.120]  We're actually now starting curfew breakers.
[51:02.120 --> 51:04.120]  You actually covered us as well.
[51:04.120 --> 51:11.120]  And beach and cities and the power between us saying that we need to demand for fraud as well.
[51:11.120 --> 51:16.120]  We actually brought actually reported 20,000 people downtown Los Angeles and one of our rallies.
[51:16.120 --> 51:20.120]  So I just want to make it very clear that a lot of people want to run from California, but there's a group of individuals here.
[51:20.120 --> 51:24.120]  That I've met personally like me that are going to fight for California.
[51:24.120 --> 51:26.120]  We want to run, but I agree with you.
[51:26.120 --> 51:29.120]  A lot of times the worst place becomes the best place.
[51:29.120 --> 51:33.120]  I believe from evidence I've seen California is really red and that the fraud is so bad.
[51:33.120 --> 51:36.120]  That's why you're under this dictatorship.
[51:36.120 --> 51:37.120]  The conversations we're having.
[51:37.120 --> 51:39.120]  So again, I want to make that very known.
[51:39.120 --> 51:44.120]  You've covered us both me, myself, personal twice, but also my group, the group that we've been here in California.
[51:44.120 --> 51:45.120]  So I really appreciate that.
[51:45.120 --> 51:49.120]  Yeah, tell folks the name of the groups you can rally and fight the Chinese takeover.
[51:49.120 --> 51:52.120]  Well, right now we're on curfew breakers in eight cities right now.
[51:52.120 --> 51:53.120]  So you probably tweeted.
[51:53.120 --> 52:00.120]  I don't interact with us in California in Los Angeles when we're doing the 20,000 plus where you came out.
[52:00.120 --> 52:04.120]  Every time you plug the group, though, I can't understand it because your phone breaks up.
[52:04.120 --> 52:06.120]  What's the name of the group again?
[52:06.120 --> 52:08.120]  Now currently we have curfew breakers.
[52:08.120 --> 52:09.120]  Curfew breakers.
[52:09.120 --> 52:10.120]  All right.
[52:10.120 --> 52:11.120]  You're beautiful.
[52:11.120 --> 52:12.120]  Thank you so much, Nick.
[52:12.120 --> 52:13.120]  Love you.
[52:13.120 --> 52:14.120]  I want to see more of your video.
[52:14.120 --> 52:15.120]  I want to get you on as a guest.
[52:15.120 --> 52:16.120]  Thank you.
[52:16.120 --> 52:17.120]  Get on with Skype with us.
[52:17.120 --> 52:19.120]  All right, Zen in Florida.
[52:19.120 --> 52:21.120]  Zen, you're on the air.
[52:21.120 --> 52:23.120]  Hey, Alex, first time caller.
[52:23.120 --> 52:26.120]  Thank you and God bless you, Owen and everybody.
[52:26.120 --> 52:28.120]  Well, I need your prayer because I want to stay in the fight.
[52:28.120 --> 52:29.120]  I'm not a victim or a limb.
[52:29.120 --> 52:33.120]  I expected to be dead a long time ago, but then they're definitely on my ass now.
[52:33.120 --> 52:35.120]  So thanks for the prayer.
[52:35.120 --> 52:39.120]  Well, there's a lot of things going on right now that we need to pray on.
[52:39.120 --> 52:46.120]  But my question with all the election fraud, the video, the statistics, et cetera, et cetera.
[52:46.120 --> 52:52.120]  What more can we, the people do to get the fire awake?
[52:52.120 --> 52:56.120]  I think like that guy that went to Costco and got up and said, it's all a fraud.
[52:56.120 --> 52:57.120]  Wake up.
[52:57.120 --> 52:58.120]  This is BS.
[52:58.120 --> 52:59.120]  They're locking everything down.
[52:59.120 --> 53:02.120]  The virus is basically a hoax and then put out your zone website.
[53:02.120 --> 53:04.120]  I think we should just disturb them.
[53:04.120 --> 53:06.120]  We should civil disobedience them.
[53:06.120 --> 53:08.120]  And I can't just say that, not do it.
[53:08.120 --> 53:10.120]  I don't know why I'm going to take a week off because I never do it.
[53:10.120 --> 53:11.120]  And it's the right thing to do.
[53:11.120 --> 53:13.120]  And I'll be so much stronger after if I do it.
[53:13.120 --> 53:18.120]  But after that, I'm going into stores, I'm going into everywhere and I'm going to raise the stink.
[53:18.120 --> 53:20.120]  I think that's what we got to do.
[53:20.120 --> 53:24.120]  Well, we need to ban those people because we're the people.
[53:24.120 --> 53:26.120]  We outnumber them.
[53:26.120 --> 53:32.120]  We just got to all get together because this is going against our constitution right now.
[53:32.120 --> 53:33.120]  I agree.
[53:33.120 --> 53:34.120]  It's like spiritual.
[53:34.120 --> 53:35.120]  I don't know how to describe it.
[53:35.120 --> 53:41.120]  Oratory skills get some people motivated, but there's this thing where you decide to do something and suddenly people are with you.
[53:41.120 --> 53:46.120]  And I just think even if you decide it and then nothing happens and you get arrested, it doesn't matter.
[53:46.120 --> 53:48.120]  Others see that it causes a chain reaction.
[53:48.120 --> 53:51.120]  You got to know God, help me, lead me.
[53:51.120 --> 53:53.120]  I don't want to be under satanic control.
[53:53.120 --> 53:54.120]  Please help me.
[53:54.120 --> 53:57.120]  God, I won't want to lay down and see God's not looking for victims.
[53:57.120 --> 54:01.120]  God's looking for those who are ready to go after people in a peaceful way.
[54:01.120 --> 54:03.120]  But through God to say God, I'm weak.
[54:03.120 --> 54:04.120]  Please help me.
[54:04.120 --> 54:06.120]  Show me how to fight these people.
[54:06.120 --> 54:11.120]  And God will give you some little task, go talk to your neighbor or go down the street.
[54:11.120 --> 54:15.120]  And then suddenly you'll be fighting the entire New World Order operation.
[54:15.120 --> 54:19.120]  Because God never puts you in a place you can't handle.
[54:19.120 --> 54:20.120]  Then I appreciate your call.
[54:20.120 --> 54:21.120]  Anything else?
[54:21.120 --> 54:22.120]  No, prison.
[54:22.120 --> 54:24.120]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[54:24.120 --> 54:25.120]  Thank you.
[54:25.120 --> 54:26.120]  I mean, I'm just telling you that's what it is.
[54:26.120 --> 54:32.120]  You got to just simply say, people say, I'll tell you the prayers God answers.
[54:32.120 --> 54:36.120]  You step out in a dangerous situation and say, I'm doing this for other people.
[54:36.120 --> 54:37.120]  Help me, God.
[54:37.120 --> 54:38.120]  God will help you.
[54:38.120 --> 55:07.120]  That's what God shows up.
[55:08.120 --> 55:34.120]  God will help you.
[55:34.120 --> 56:00.120]  God will help you.
[56:00.120 --> 56:26.120]  God will help you.
[56:26.120 --> 56:52.120]  God will help you.
[56:52.120 --> 57:21.120]  God will help you.
[57:21.120 --> 57:32.120]  God will help you.
[57:32.120 --> 57:36.120]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Idaho.
[57:36.120 --> 57:41.120]  Steve, thanks for holding it on the air.
[57:41.120 --> 57:42.120]  Welcome.
[57:42.120 --> 57:45.120]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[57:45.120 --> 57:52.520]  Yes, sir. I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of living defense in from Utah
[57:52.520 --> 57:56.300]  I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update
[57:56.760 --> 58:02.000]  Because that commercial that infomercial you've been doing that thing's getting old. I'm getting tired of hearing
[58:02.000 --> 58:06.020]  It's like a year old brother. But hey, it's a go ahead. Tell us tell us what's going on
[58:06.680 --> 58:11.440]  Well, man, listen, you know last year when I called in I was actually in the Denver Airport
[58:11.440 --> 58:18.060]  It was a Sunday show and I was just mess around you gave out the number and I punched it in my phone and lo and behold
[58:18.320 --> 58:22.200]  It was straight through to your producer and he said hey
[58:22.240 --> 58:25.360]  He said who's calling and where you're calling from and I told him and
[58:26.200 --> 58:29.520]  Immediately like you came on the line and I was so dumbfounded
[58:29.880 --> 58:34.840]  that the only thing I could think of was to tell my story about living defense because I
[58:35.040 --> 58:38.320]  Said if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones show
[58:38.320 --> 58:43.920]  I'm gonna tell the world about living defense and what it did for me personally now look
[58:43.920 --> 58:49.680]  I'm 64 years old going on 20. Thanks to this info for store products
[58:49.680 --> 58:55.800]  And by the way, I bought eight hundred dollars worth the other night. So I'm doing what I can problem doing what I can
[58:55.800 --> 58:59.760]  You're the only reason we're still on there. They'd have a shut down my friend. They're so pissed off. Thank you
[58:59.760 --> 59:02.880]  Well, tell us what tell us the update that you were on over a year ago
[59:03.520 --> 59:06.720]  Yeah, yeah, it was a year ago, but I gotta tell you
[59:06.720 --> 59:14.440]  You came back on the line a few days after I called in and because you made that infomercial and you said all the product
[59:14.440 --> 59:15.960]  Had sold off the show
[59:15.960 --> 59:18.360]  So I said to myself, I'm gonna get on it
[59:18.360 --> 59:23.880]  I'm gonna do my best to get on Alex the show so I can tell a little bit more about this
[59:23.880 --> 59:28.440]  Look, you know, we're talking a lot about the code COVID-19 and you know
[59:28.440 --> 59:32.560]  You're always talking about the sink in the D3 and the C and you know
[59:32.560 --> 59:41.200]  This is keeping a strong immune system is our best defense. But look everybody out there Alex listening right now has got parasite
[59:41.480 --> 59:48.480]  What do you think you do or you don't you do and if you eat fish if you eat sushi, you're riddled with
[59:48.800 --> 59:56.840]  So what my my contention is why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense
[59:56.840 --> 1:00:04.720]  Now you gotta follow that up with the micro ZX. I learned that so I don't tell people to get the living defense unless I follow up
[1:00:04.720 --> 1:00:08.080]  With the micro ZX and I'm sure you want to say something about that
[1:00:08.240 --> 1:00:11.680]  But man, everybody needs to get this product
[1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:18.880]  We need to get it all out of your warehouse by Monday because you can still order on Monday and most of the people in the lower
[1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:22.440]  By the way, brother, we didn't set this up. I was thinking about using a few days ago
[1:00:22.440 --> 1:00:27.560]  We've been sold out of living defense for months. It came in and I thought of you Steve
[1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:31.560]  And then I said run that old ad and it's our number one seller right now
[1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:33.680]  We were actually losing money
[1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:39.720]  So far in the last month and thanks to you we already sold your ad already sold like 2,000 bottles
[1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:45.480]  I actually paid the bills here. So it's like God working is so amazing. We didn't know we didn't screen your call
[1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:50.080]  We had no idea and I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about living defense
[1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:55.480]  Let me tell you Dr. Group when he developed this told me how incredible it was and I should take it all this stuff
[1:00:55.480 --> 1:00:58.320]  And I know he's real, but I didn't do it
[1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:03.120]  I took it over a year ago and lost like 20 something pounds and I'm back on it right now
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:06.280]  I'm about to lose a bunch of weight. It's already starting to happen. I don't want to get into what happens
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:11.520]  But let's just say it's it's a little explosive. So yeah, it's got all that key organic stuff in there
[1:01:11.520 --> 1:01:18.000]  It does amazing things and I really appreciate your plug your realism you connected with folks and you took a product
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:21.280]  It was a decent seller took it to number one brother. I really appreciate you Steve
[1:01:21.280 --> 1:01:25.280]  We should we should get your name and number get you on as a guest or send you a case of living defense
[1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:29.240]  We got about well, I'll tell you what don't hang up Steve
[1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:33.520]  You never got to living defense what it did, but I can't just sit there and talk about living defense all day
[1:01:33.600 --> 1:01:38.000]  We've got a lot to cover like the Chinese takeover and how to defeat them, but yeah
[1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:43.920]  It's amazing. It's 50% off back in stock info or store.com. So we're gonna come back
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:49.720]  And I'll do one more segment of calls before I hit this big news. Then I'll go back to call stay with us
[1:01:52.960 --> 1:02:00.640]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare the United Nations the big corporations the globalists big tech and big
[1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:04.160]  Farmer all pushing the covers the most deadly thing in history even though statistically
[1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:06.440]  It's a very weak flu or cold
[1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:09.920]  But if you are deficient then you can actually die from it
[1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:17.520]  That's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes. Meanwhile all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical
[1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:20.600]  Officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine
[1:02:20.840 --> 1:02:26.700]  Especially the mRNA ones are basically bio weapons that are super deadly and now they're having to resuscitate people that die
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:32.360]  Basically when they take it just like newborn babies they give vaccines they have to resuscitate them all the time
[1:02:32.360 --> 1:02:35.360]  Or a lot of times they just let them die and that's on the record
[1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:41.560]  It does that Guillain berets narcolepsy cancer all these other diseases, but they tell you safe and effective no one's getting hurt
[1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:45.880]  It's a conspiracy theory and then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly
[1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:52.040]  So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe. They do it
[1:02:52.040 --> 1:02:54.040]  I
[1:03:04.920 --> 1:03:12.040]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones. I'm up here in space
[1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:20.440]  I'm looking down on you my laser trace
[1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:24.040]  Everything you do
[1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:28.880]  You think you lead private lives think nothing of the kind
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:33.760]  There is no truest game. I'm watching all the time
[1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:37.120]  I'm a lamento
[1:03:37.440 --> 1:03:39.440]  My site is clean
[1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:43.640]  I am perpetual. I keep the country free
[1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:50.840]  That's written back in the 1980s and boy didn't it come through
[1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:54.320]  But it didn't keep us free did it
[1:03:55.960 --> 1:04:01.640]  All right, I got loaded phone lines. I told you I've just got this obsession to get back to taking a lot of calls
[1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:03.640]  I did a new show this morning
[1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:09.240]  8 to 11 before we went to my live regular show. We did a live show
[1:04:10.360 --> 1:04:11.680]  titled
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:13.600]  Amply so
[1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:18.000]  American Journal of a C-span, but we're doing it again right now, but I've got
[1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:23.000]  Really important news I'm gonna cover next segment on
[1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:27.080]  Trump killing the
[1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:31.520]  Pentagon briefings to Joe Biden
[1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:38.760]  Which really signals Trump's about to take action there's a bunch of other big stuff happening as well
[1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:43.440]  So I'm not one of these two guys. I don't want to give you false hope if this all turns out to be true
[1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:49.520]  I'll say okay, Q's real, but some big stuff's going on and I've talked to people defense intelligence agency
[1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:56.400]  I've talked to people in Delta Force. I've talked to people in the CIA who were patriots and they say no
[1:04:57.120 --> 1:05:01.200]  Trump's gonna move against them. Just watch and see it. I'm like y'all believe when I see it now
[1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:06.080]  It's starting to happen. I'll hit that next segment, but right now. Well, let's go back to Steve in Idaho
[1:05:07.120 --> 1:05:09.220]  If you've heard ads running last year
[1:05:09.960 --> 1:05:11.960]  He's a real guy took living defense
[1:05:12.040 --> 1:05:18.720]  Which is an anti-parasite anti toxicity flush of the intestines with natural herbs that are really strong and organic
[1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:24.040]  It's been sold out for months. It's back in stock. He's tried to get in before he gets in today. That's God's will
[1:05:24.480 --> 1:05:28.200]  Steve thank you finish your point about living defense and what you wanted to say
[1:05:28.200 --> 1:05:30.960]  Well, thank you so much Alice. It's such a
[1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:33.600]  Blessing from God to be on this show today
[1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:39.720]  You know, it's been one of my lifelong dreams is to show up on the Alex Jones show one day and here I am
[1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:45.480]  And I know it's God's will but look one of the things about the COVID-19 is we get we need to keep that real strong
[1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:52.320]  Healthy immune system. That's our first defense and a lot of people with these parasites all over their bodies
[1:05:52.320 --> 1:05:54.320]  They're spending a lot of energy
[1:05:54.560 --> 1:05:55.920]  excuse me
[1:05:55.920 --> 1:05:59.680]  Where they don't need to and and you know, you've got to detox
[1:05:59.680 --> 1:06:04.720]  I don't hear what your health and wellness regime is if you like you're talking about losing weight
[1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:12.520]  And you're doing it the right way because you're starting off with the living defense and the micro zx to get all those toxins and all those parasites
[1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:18.320]  You know, you need to do this about once every six months because those parasites come back if you eat me
[1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:24.000]  If you eat any kind of fish just about everything has got some sort of bacterial parasite
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:31.440]  And this is the best product on the market. I've proven that over and over and I just remember the YouTube videos where they would put
[1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:34.800]  Chemicals on pork chops and worms would come out. Oh
[1:06:35.520 --> 1:06:41.360]  Yeah, no, I've seen it man ham if you eat ham you got you got lots of critters
[1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:46.240]  But you know what I love about this product is think about it when you kill the parasite
[1:06:46.400 --> 1:06:52.720]  These are living carcasses. These are these bodies of these creatures are inside of you
[1:06:52.720 --> 1:06:58.560]  Well, Dr. Groove formulated this with the right, you know with the neem and the other things
[1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:03.760]  Close to get this out of your body, you know, it's one thing to kill the parasite
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:09.360]  What are you gonna do? Just leave them in your body. You got to get rid of so anyway, I want to give us
[1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:11.520]  Did you know that in places like
[1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:13.760]  Vietnam and and Thailand
[1:07:14.320 --> 1:07:17.360]  They take paint worms to lose weight. That is disgusting
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:21.840]  I've heard that I've heard that Alex. Let me let me wrap up with one thing
[1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:24.160]  You know, you were very instrumental
[1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:31.360]  You used to say all the time, especially just veterans you say you guys got to get more involved make the youtube do this
[1:07:31.360 --> 1:07:38.320]  Do that. Well, right after the inauguration. I started a youtube channel. I got up to 50,000 followers
[1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:44.320]  I had about 7 million views and then on black Friday. They finally terminated
[1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:51.360]  I remember the first day you ever started talking about being banned and you told us you said every one of you
[1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:57.600]  If you're a patriot and if you're purporting truth, you're gonna get you're gonna get you're gonna go that way and finally
[1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:03.760]  I hung on until black Friday, but I'm gone. So the question is can I just give out my two websites?
[1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:08.160]  I'm trying to reestablish myself. Oh, that's beautiful. But let me give this last piece of advice
[1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:11.680]  Everyone under another cheap
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:17.120]  Burner phone creak because they test how they track you and use another computer and all the same IP address
[1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:22.880]  Create sub youtube's twitter's and facebook's. We did this. They still haven't got them all they're so pissed
[1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:26.080]  And then what you do is
[1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:28.960]  You promote though like it's not your site the other site
[1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:36.480]  And then when they get that one, it's like whack-a-mole. You've already grown more outposts, but absolutely people should go to urls
[1:08:36.960 --> 1:08:40.960]  That's the real model is to go to original urls. So give us your urls
[1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:50.400]  Okay, it's a retired marine sounds off comm or marine sounds off comm and then I've got a podcast
[1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:55.520]  I just started on 1st of december that's doing right quite well. It's true news
[1:08:56.640 --> 1:09:01.920]  Podcasts.com. It's like it's you know, tr u e true news podcast.com
[1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:06.720]  I'd really appreciate anybody that checks those out and would like to subscribe because uh,
[1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:11.440]  You know, it's really it hurts man. When you lose 50,000 subscribers
[1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:16.000]  But again, they did that to you because you were popular and the people loved you. It was the truth
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:19.440]  That's why they suppress you. That's a badge of honor and you've come back again
[1:09:19.920 --> 1:09:23.200]  So we love you steve. We should get you on as a guest get steve's name a number
[1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:27.200]  We should get him on as a guest on my show or one of the other shows. We love you steve. Thank you
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:31.600]  And that's the problem with callers. I say I'm gonna take a lot of them. They're so good
[1:09:31.920 --> 1:09:35.600]  You're so good, but then I never get the calls. I never get to you
[1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:39.840]  But that was amazing. All right, let's take another caller here
[1:09:40.400 --> 1:09:43.600]  Who is up next in the order of the calls received?
[1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:47.280]  Emily in new york. Thank you for holding your own here
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:53.600]  Hello. Hi, Emily. Welcome. Wow, alex. This is amazing. I have
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:56.240]  listened to you since
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:00.880]  Probably 2004 watched a lot of your videos with a lot of friends
[1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:03.600]  And have really done the organic
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:05.600]  Um boots to the ground
[1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:07.920]  Telling people what's going on
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.600]  Um, you know, obama deception, especially when it seemed like nobody was listening
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:17.760]  And lo and behold, there was a lot that was going on in the undercurrent in new york state
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:20.400]  So that being said, um
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:23.040]  With
[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:25.040]  everything happening in new york state
[1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:32.320]  There is there's so many people that support trump and it is silenced. It's I was at a rally
[1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:39.200]  In january in the capital and we were probably you know a couple in the corridor
[1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:43.680]  Um across from governor colm will giving his state of the state address
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:48.320]  Now there's a few thousand of us getting in senator spaces yelling
[1:10:48.880 --> 1:10:50.880]  um protesting
[1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:55.440]  And and that was the hpv vaccine. Um the the mandatory flu shots
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:11:01.360]  Oh, yeah, remember they vaded tested this all last year and yeah, exactly with the force inoculations
[1:11:01.360 --> 1:11:09.120]  Those this was all vaded tested exactly and you know, there was at least a hundred. Um, remember they said orthodox jews all had to take it
[1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:13.760]  Yeah, it was horrible. Yes. Yes. And so we were we're all there and um
[1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:17.680]  They they the nobody reported on this there were
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:22.400]  Maybe I think albany news reported that were there were a couple hundred people there
[1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:25.440]  So they completely silence that they they're
[1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:28.960]  The lockdown in new york state is crazy because
[1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:30.960]  What happened when we were in albany?
[1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:34.800]  Um, and I heard from senators and when I was in in the um
[1:11:35.440 --> 1:11:37.440]  Elevator with them. They didn't realize who I was with
[1:11:38.400 --> 1:11:43.440]  Um, they they said wow, there were so many people here. This is insane. Um,
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:47.280]  They said we we've got to do something about this. So what happened was
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:50.880]  Even though there's a democratic stronghold in new york state
[1:11:51.280 --> 1:11:55.520]  The democrats couldn't agree with each other because there were so many people there that were in their face
[1:11:55.520 --> 1:12:00.960]  Um, so they couldn't move on the bills that they had. Um, they wanted to push through
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:07.440]  In january, but of course, you know, kovat came through and they they locked us all down. Um,
[1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:10.160]  but I just find it interesting because
[1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:12.800]  Uh, there's power went even in
[1:12:13.440 --> 1:12:15.440]  corruption new york state
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:19.920]  There's power when people get together they show up and they do not stay quiet
[1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:24.880]  And I totally agree with you and hima bebaloma virus has been directly linked to attacking women's ovaries
[1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:26.000]  So it's another
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:27.360]  depopulation weapon
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:32.960]  What a group of monsters and by having a state kick it in as texas did shamefully 15 years ago
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:40.560]  It creates liability protection so women and girls can't sue when they get screwed up by it. Thank you so much, emily

[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  You
[1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:21.680]  The globalists should not want the united states back in black
[1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:24.240]  They want us in the red
[1:15:24.320 --> 1:15:26.320]  They want us bankrupted under their control
[1:15:26.320 --> 1:15:30.320]  I'm telling you we get trump reelected and overpower the commies

[1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:45.840]  America's got nine lives
[1:15:50.640 --> 1:15:52.640]  All right, let me hit the big news
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:55.440]  Then I'll take calls for a couple segments
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:15:58.800]  And then David Ike's son who's quite the filmmaker
[1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:01.840]  Is going to be joining us with some big breaking news?
[1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:05.120]  And then we will go back to your calls and then we've got
[1:16:05.840 --> 1:16:12.080]  Nick baggage at real trailblazer dr. Nick baggage exposing the globalists hosting the fourth hour ahead of the war room
[1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:15.120]  With Owen shroyer that I'll be back this sunday live
[1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:20.080]  Four to six p.m. Central hell wild horses can't drag me away, but
[1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:24.960]  Every time I actually take a week off, which is very rare. Have you every year or so?
[1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:32.960]  It's a big effect for me a better broadcast better brain better focus just not working. I was like 10 pounds in a week
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:39.600]  You know, I just need to there's a stress of this. It's like the cortisol's it releases are incredible
[1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:45.120]  So let's go ahead right now
[1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:49.440]  And and you know, I could sit here and I can show you all these articles
[1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:53.680]  Or I can just cut right to the chase and I think I'll do both
[1:16:55.600 --> 1:17:00.960]  Trump has every right and we have every right under the declaration of independence and under common sense
[1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:07.520]  And under everything that's happened to say we're not slaves of hollywood and the devil worshiping left and their chai-com
[1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:13.680]  Backers and the eu new world order and all the fraud they've engaged in so we declare
[1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:15.680]  That we are not your slave
[1:17:16.320 --> 1:17:21.600]  And if what we declare is true others will resonate with it in history of we're leaders and we will win
[1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:26.080]  But in the case of this it's so over the top
[1:17:26.560 --> 1:17:33.200]  So insane trump won by a record giant landslide. We know that he won the battleground states
[1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:38.720]  His margin of victory was double triple quadruple what it was instead of half a percent
[1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:40.320]  He had a point instead of a point
[1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:45.520]  He had three points instead of that he had five points six points. They close it down. You know the fraud
[1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:49.520]  They bring in the fake ballots trump was trying to return the republic
[1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:51.680]  I don't agree with him going along with the vaccine
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:56.640]  Try to you know in the lockdown, but it doesn't matter. You know the globalists don't want trump
[1:17:58.160 --> 1:18:02.240]  And so here's just some of the headlines that all tie together today as you see the worm turning
[1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:06.080]  That doesn't mean we're out of the woods doesn't mean i'm saying in 33 days
[1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:07.520]  He's going to be the president
[1:18:07.520 --> 1:18:10.080]  But we're starting to see movement the direction that shows victory
[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:14.160]  Tuberville throws support behind electoral college
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:20.880]  Challenge says we're going to have to do it in the senate. You got ran paul saying you had other senators saying it
[1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:25.120]  That's enough senators to get hearings in the senate coming up the next few weeks
[1:18:26.480 --> 1:18:28.480]  Breaking representatives dozer
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:30.640]  Biggs banks gomer
[1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:37.440]  And more join moral brooks paul for congressional election integrity hearings. So it's starting
[1:18:38.320 --> 1:18:40.320]  Georgia
[1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:45.280]  The person behind all this secretary of state
[1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:52.480]  Begged for 100 chinese to vote for him by mail in 2015 won by 159 votes
[1:18:53.120 --> 1:18:55.120]  You can't make this up as your tricom agents
[1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:57.520]  turns out the actual
[1:18:57.520 --> 1:19:02.080]  Chinese government agents came and met with all of them on video. I mean, this is just insane
[1:19:02.560 --> 1:19:05.600]  Confirmed dominion uses solar wind software
[1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:13.280]  Denies using software included in devastating a hack. So that big raid now five days ago in austin
[1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:18.640]  You begin to learn that's trump taking action that scares the hell out of the system
[1:19:20.640 --> 1:19:25.760]  Georgia dem senate candidate warlock tells followers jesus was a poor palestinian
[1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:27.760]  So we're getting all that islamic garbage
[1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:30.800]  And it goes on
[1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:35.120]  And on breaking shelly luther backs mo brooks called for immediate
[1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:39.440]  congressional election integrity hearings. That's some of the national file file
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  Now that's just some of the background
[1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:44.800]  Now let's get in the real meat potatoes for you right here
[1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:49.360]  General flinn there's video of this clearly there was foreign
[1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:56.960]  Influence tied to these dominion machines goes back to china russia iran trump should revote these states
[1:19:57.680 --> 1:20:01.280]  That is very reasonable. That's where this call should start
[1:20:01.840 --> 1:20:03.840]  And with the hearings in the house
[1:20:04.480 --> 1:20:06.480]  And the senate that are now unfolding
[1:20:07.200 --> 1:20:13.120]  There's a larger article with all of it flinn says trump could use martial law to force election redo and swing states
[1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:17.120]  Info wars com has the big in-depth report
[1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:19.120]  Breaking that down
[1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:21.760]  Now let's look at what's currently happening
[1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:27.360]  Today at 230 central and we're going to try to get any coverage of this if it's live probably won't be
[1:20:27.680 --> 1:20:30.480]  President trump to meet with acting defense secretary at oval office
[1:20:31.280 --> 1:20:33.280]  To discuss the chai com threat
[1:20:34.400 --> 1:20:37.840]  And here it is acting pentagon chief. Now. This is the biggest piece up front
[1:20:38.880 --> 1:20:42.480]  Acting pentagon chief halts biden transition briefings
[1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:48.320]  So he's halting those briefings meaning trumps getting ready to go to the resolute desk and announce that
[1:20:48.640 --> 1:20:54.480]  He's a chai com agent. Here's the evidence america. You can't allow this 10 million people need to march on dc right now
[1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:59.120]  And if i'm sitting there on christmas, even trump says that i'm on an airplane. I'm in a car
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:02.160]  I'm walking and i have to i'm taking action
[1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:08.400]  That's what i keep saying trump has to call it out like it is call for us to peacefully take action
[1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:12.800]  Has to identify the enemies that will trigger the just department to have balls
[1:21:13.760 --> 1:21:18.160]  And that will trigger the military already has balls to get ready for what's about to go down
[1:21:18.800 --> 1:21:23.360]  Or let a known chai com agent get control and do all this acting defense secretary
[1:21:23.840 --> 1:21:30.160]  chris miller ordered pentagon wide halt to cooperation with the transition of president elect biden the fraud
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:34.400]  That's uh out of axio shocking officials across the defense department
[1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:40.320]  Senior officials said today behind the scenes why it matters? What happened pentagon official response?
[1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:42.960]  It's all coming up
[1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:45.840]  And again 19 house members submit
[1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:52.960]  Letter seeking senate hearings on election fraud supreme court justice for your democrat riots
[1:21:53.760 --> 1:21:58.080]  Judge roberts heard screaming to the other eight. You must do this or the cities will burn
[1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:01.760]  See that's the real globalist world
[1:22:01.760 --> 1:22:05.760]  You see that's the real globalist black lives matter soros
[1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:10.400]  Ukraine model that they'll burn the country down if we don't submit well
[1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:13.440]  We call the bluff of terrorists and say let's get it on
[1:22:14.320 --> 1:22:17.520]  I mean i'm doing it here rag tag band in austin texas
[1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:21.280]  And you guys have so much more pull and clout
[1:22:22.480 --> 1:22:23.920]  You know if you bow down this time
[1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:30.080]  What do you got to bow down to next time force inoculations pedophiles coming and having story time with your kids?
[1:22:30.080 --> 1:22:36.240]  I mean these are pervert sicko freakazoids that have no end. They want our innocence
[1:22:36.400 --> 1:22:44.960]  They want to drink up our essence. They're vampires. So I say burn in hell soros burn in hell biden burn in hell

[1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:04.720]  To pray to christ and pray to the father and the son the holy ghost all of it and just say protect us
[1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:08.240]  From this evil because they're scared of us in public calling them out
[1:23:08.240 --> 1:23:13.440]  Why'd they have over a thousand publications and all those tv shows attack me and say I said kill joe biden
[1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:20.160]  I said he's spiritually dead. He's a corpse of satan. He's already dead a reanimated corpse there to attack us
[1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:24.880]  I wish no physical harm upon a dead body. I said we must politically destroy him
[1:23:24.880 --> 1:23:31.600]  We must rebuke him and he'll be removed one way or another legally and lawfully and it shook them to their core because they're empty
[1:23:31.680 --> 1:23:36.800]  That's why they want to suck us up because they have nothing. George Soros is damned to hell
[1:23:37.200 --> 1:23:41.440]  Damn you to hell soros damn you to hell the name of jesus
[1:23:41.680 --> 1:23:47.680]  Damn, george soros to hell in the name of jesus christ damn you to hell soros in the name of christ
[1:23:47.680 --> 1:23:54.960]  He's concerned about the coming chaos after the november elections. This will be an extremely important message
[1:23:55.200 --> 1:24:02.400]  Here's why no matter what the outcome in november catastrophic social upheaval is a very real possibility

[1:27:53.520 --> 1:27:56.240]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:07.840]  Defending the republic from enemies far and end domestic
[1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:18.880]  You know, I'm not melodramatic here
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:22.080]  Well, I say these things I mean them. It's not theater
[1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:25.600]  The number one thing they put on the news is jones says he's an actor
[1:28:26.080 --> 1:28:31.920]  There's one time in like a custody battle. That's why they're like look. He's in a joker outfit saying he wants kids to take drugs
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:36.560]  And I'm like I'm being an actor making a joke so kids won't take drugs
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:41.280]  I'm saying hey kids. I want you to die take drugs in a joker outfit. I was being an actor there
[1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:43.440]  I'm not an actor when I'm on air
[1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:45.600]  I mean damn well what I'm saying here
[1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:47.920]  Everybody knows it
[1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:55.280]  But howard stern still has a gigantic show number one show on xm probably reaches five million people a day conservative with a tune in
[1:28:56.240 --> 1:28:59.600]  And he's up there every week now doing these puppet show videos
[1:28:59.920 --> 1:29:02.320]  They're very viral and sent us a lot of new listeners
[1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:06.480]  So I don't want to attack stern too much so he gets in trouble and can't make these
[1:29:06.480 --> 1:29:10.080]  I know stern said he was a listener before and had me on a few times as a guest
[1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:14.400]  I was used to going on his network like once a month for years till somebody killed it
[1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:20.240]  And so I think overall stern's trying to actually warn people through the show. Maybe I'm wrong
[1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:25.760]  But when he says this one thing about I don't want whites to take the vaccines, you don't get sterilized. That's true
[1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:30.640]  I don't want blacks to take it or Hispanics or anybody. I don't want anybody to get hurt by this
[1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:34.960]  But everything else he says is basically real quotes. They found hiv in the vaccine
[1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:38.320]  All of this and so I wonder what's going on over there with stern
[1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:45.120]  Uh, so here's that piece and part of tucker curlson last night on the vaccine very powerful than another segment with your phone calls
[1:29:45.360 --> 1:29:49.520]  I had a david ike's son joining us with this new film that drops at bandot video
[1:29:50.080 --> 1:29:54.080]  Premiering in a matter of minutes, but first here's howard stern and then tucker curls
[1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:57.600]  Alex jones is joining us via zoom. He wants to yes
[1:29:57.680 --> 1:30:01.360]  He wants to discuss the covet vaccine and he wants to wish everyone a merry christmas

[1:30:32.560 --> 1:30:40.480]  So you can go ahead. They want forced inoculation of the gates vaccination, which has the hiv delivery system gene coding
[1:30:40.560 --> 1:30:44.960]  It has hiv in it. It has hiv in it. It has hiv in it
[1:30:45.040 --> 1:30:50.800]  This is aids 2.0 eugenics from a post human world. Do you understand that?
[1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:54.320]  Well, I mean, I thank you for slowing down. I appreciate that
[1:30:54.400 --> 1:30:58.080]  We got to keep the christmas spirit alive here regardless of what the globalists want to do

[1:32:47.360 --> 1:32:51.040]  I test all the products personally myself one by one at a time
[1:32:51.440 --> 1:32:56.240]  That's how you're getting quality products at info wars dot com. Thank you alex
[1:32:56.400 --> 1:33:01.440]  Appreciate all your I know you got a busy schedule. You got a you you're gonna be investigating several things
[1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:06.800]  Why does the alex puppet have a nicer studio than me? Look at that. It's gorgeous. Yeah, it's very nice
[1:33:06.800 --> 1:33:17.600]  It was I gotta go. We'll be back right after these words
[1:33:17.600 --> 1:33:25.600]  You look at that
[1:33:30.720 --> 1:33:33.360]  Coronavirus vaccine is finally here
[1:33:33.920 --> 1:33:35.520]  It's arriving in small bottles
[1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:41.440]  But with a glitzy entrance the coronavirus vaccine has been accompanied by the kind of corporate image campaign
[1:33:41.760 --> 1:33:44.800]  You typically associate with higher end consumer products
[1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:49.600]  Imagine the rollout for a hollywood blockbuster the new iphone. That's what it's like
[1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:55.120]  Suddenly the covet vaccine is on the morning shows. It's being touted on celebrity twitter accounts
[1:33:55.520 --> 1:33:59.120]  And the news about it is uniformly glowing. This stuff is just great
[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:01.520]  A lot of famous people say so
[1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:06.960]  Just the other day the guy who played gandalf and the lord of the ring series got the vaccine as on any media tour
[1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:10.560]  The paparazzi were there for the dramatic moment when they stuck the needle in his arm
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:15.520]  It's a very special day the gandalf actor told Reuters. I feel euphoric
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:21.440]  I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. I feel very lucky to have had the vaccination
[1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:25.920]  In other words, taste great less filling. He is indeed a very lucky man
[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:29.040]  And you will feel lucky too and you finally get the vaccine
[1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:32.640]  That's so a health care worker in juno, alaska feels tonight lucky
[1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:36.480]  She got the vaccine two days ago. The woman had no history of allergies
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:41.040]  But within minutes she developed a severe anaphylactic reaction to it and then had trouble breathing
[1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:47.280]  She went up in the emergency room overnight. It was all a fantastic experience according to the doctor who treated her
[1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:53.680]  Quote during the whole time. She was still enthusiastic that she got the vaccine and the benefits it would give her in the future
[1:34:54.240 --> 1:34:56.960]  What a cheerful patient. She must be we've got to assume
[1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:01.040]  She is in any case because we can't really know the authorities didn't release her name
[1:35:01.040 --> 1:35:07.760]  All we know is she's a highly satisfied customer yet another have a vaccine and a smile. Just do it
[1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:13.440]  So how are the rest of us supposed to respond to a marketing campaign like this?
[1:35:14.080 --> 1:35:15.680]  Well, nervously
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:19.040]  Even if you're strongly supportive of vaccines and we are
[1:35:19.520 --> 1:35:25.440]  Even if you recognize how many millions of lives have been saved over the past 50 years by vaccines and we do
[1:35:25.440 --> 1:35:30.320]  It all seems a bit much. It feels false because it is it's too slick
[1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:36.880]  The gendalf guy was euphoric because he got a shot. It wasn't harrowing. It was the corona vaccine
[1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:41.520]  The lady who couldn't breathe is enthusiastic as she is rushed to the emergency room
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:44.160]  Come on. This is patronizing
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:48.400]  Stop with the slogans better to treat americans like adults
[1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:52.960]  Explain the benefits be honest about the risks and let the rest of us decide
[1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:57.200]  In this country we control our own bodies. They're always telling us that
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:35:59.040]  but no
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:04.880]  Suddenly the rules have changed on the question of the corona vaccine our leaders are definitely not pro-choice
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:09.280]  Their view is do what you're told and don't complain no uncomfortable questions
[1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:13.840]  Those aren't just suggestions. They're rules and silicon valley plans to enforce them
[1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:19.120]  twitter's announced a new policy to censor any unauthorized inquiry about the vaccine
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:24.640]  Or is the company put it false or misleading narratives about quote covid-19 vaccinations
[1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:31.920]  Among other things twitter is censoring any claim that this vaccine might be used to quote control populations
[1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:39.840]  So whatever you do, don't say this is social control because if you do the richest the most powerful people in the world will act in perfect
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:42.240]  Coordination to shut you down immediately
[1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:46.320]  So to repeat there is no social control going on here none
[1:36:46.320 --> 1:36:49.840]  And if you suggest otherwise twitter social controls will censor you
[1:36:50.560 --> 1:36:52.320]  and not just twitter's
[1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:59.440]  Facebook has now decided it must quote build demand for vaccination in communities worldwide by sharing quote
[1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:02.160]  reassuring information about getting the vaccine
[1:37:03.040 --> 1:37:07.600]  So mark Zuckerberg was a tech tycoon now. He's a professional marketer
[1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:13.440]  Mark Zuckerberg's job is to make you want this vaccine like a cold beer on a hot day
[1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:16.240]  Ask for it by name wherever the better medicines are sold
[1:37:16.960 --> 1:37:21.200]  Fortunately for mark zuckerberg. He gets to control the conversation about the product he's selling
[1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:28.800]  Facebook has announced it will squelch quote any misinformation it sees about this vaccine other billionaires think that's a great idea
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:33.920]  Do the social media companies facebook youtube twitter on and on
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:38.240]  Have a responsibility to do more right now melinda in terms of
[1:37:38.240 --> 1:37:42.880]  Getting this misinformation this disinformation off their platforms
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:49.120]  They absolutely have a responsibility the internet and the rise of social media has
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  Fox has betrayed president trump as i predicted they would they've always been
[1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:58.960]  Part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse if they're able to keep trump from
[1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:02.720]  Rightfully taking office for second term on jerry and 20th
[1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:08.480]  The system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic. They are going to explode gas prices
[1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:12.960]  They're going to shut down our cold power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source to us
[1:38:13.200 --> 1:38:18.560]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic domination. This is economic war
[1:38:18.880 --> 1:38:24.160]  We are being consolidated. We are being taken over the democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:28.640]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:35.760]  Absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property. This is a monopolistic takeover
[1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:39.760]  That's what the great reset is cloud swab and these other criminals admit it
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:44.880]  That's what social distancing is so your business is only a 25 percent for several more years
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:48.880]  No small businesses will be there. This is a master plan. Say no
[1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:52.880]  I'm sure dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism
[1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:55.520]  other dictionaries have somewhere once
[1:38:55.520 --> 1:39:02.960]  Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason
[1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:06.960]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them
[1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:13.360]  That's exactly what all this overblown covid 19 garbage is you see the headlines from cnn abc news
[1:39:13.440 --> 1:39:17.680]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought covid more devastating than they could ever imagine
[1:39:18.320 --> 1:39:20.080]  They told us that
[1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:26.800]  Two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three months. Okay, it's a quarter million
[1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:29.680]  If you count all of the people that died of other things
[1:39:30.080 --> 1:39:34.080]  We're talking 96 had co-morbidity. These are real numbers. These are real facts
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:38.800]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses never come out and are taught
[1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:42.000]  We're not essential while the big box stores in amazon take over the planet
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:49.760]  But you could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you can put up with and survive
[1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:53.440]  Hey steve, how you doing? Hey, Alex? Oh my god
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:59.360]  Long time listener first time caller look in january 2016. I went in a hospital
[1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:03.040]  I went in the va hospital out here in boise and I was in there until june
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:07.760]  And I kept hearing dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense. Let me tell you something man
[1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:15.280]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried every test
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:20.720]  Nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when I kept hearing you and dr. Group and those commercials
[1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:23.920]  I said, you know what? I'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense now
[1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:26.560]  I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have it
[1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:32.080]  But I ordered it had it shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it man
[1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:36.640]  That stuff changed my life. It saved my life. If there's any veteran out there
[1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:39.520]  I don't give you travel though anybody's traveled overseas
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:45.360]  You absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense. It's true folks
[1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:50.080]  We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality and living defense is over the top good
[1:40:50.480 --> 1:40:56.400]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome. They are forcing mutations
[1:40:56.960 --> 1:41:00.000]  This is forced evolution or de-evolution
[1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:03.680]  When you look at all the major research all the major programs are carrying out
[1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:08.640]  They are not to produce people that are smarter or folks that live longer or more moral
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:14.800]  No, it's turning humanity into a commodity. Now, we see some propaganda like communist china bragging
[1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:21.280]  Hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers superman. That's a way to make it sexy that hey
[1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:23.760]  We're experimenting on our troops
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:29.840]  We'll send things what happened to our troops and thousands and thousands of died each time they tried a new experimental vaccine
[1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:34.560]  I've talked to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas self department
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:37.920]  They say Alex, you know, it hurts a lot of people. It's for a greater good
[1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:43.360]  But that's not even true and it violates this unique convention the urmberg code federal state law
[1:41:43.840 --> 1:41:49.440]  This is violence being carried out against us by that of the tyranny and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary
[1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:56.240]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:24.800]  We got some clips of it more he joins us in the next hour. Thank you so much for joining us
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:30.880]  Just briefly this is the last day to order products at info or store.com to get guaranteed delivery
[1:42:30.960 --> 1:42:34.400]  Whether it's hawaii or alaska you can still order by monday
[1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:37.280]  and get it anywhere in the
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:40.880]  Conus as they call it before christmas, but it's a smart move to get it ordered now
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:45.840]  You heard the plug for living defense to flush out all the unwanted visitors. It's amazing. We've also got
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:48.880]  a big immune booster in it's
[1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:54.720]  Across the guard, but saw palmetto is good for women as well. Then it's got the vitamin d. It's got all the other
[1:42:55.360 --> 1:43:01.040]  Vitamins and minerals that you need for your immune system in it. It's very inexpensive, but very very high quality
[1:43:02.320 --> 1:43:04.960]  And we've got I guess it's not in here anymore. We've also got
[1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:09.360]  Alpha power that is a drier version of supermail vitality
[1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:13.360]  But it's also got a patented ingredient that booster to stostar own women like it as well
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:20.800]  But it is made for men women can take it as well. It's back at stock 50% off and free shipping double patriot points
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:23.760]  At info or store.com. And that's how we fund our operation
[1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:28.880]  We've stood up to three years of dnc lawsuits. They found more than 50 of them
[1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:31.840]  We got all but five thrown out
[1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:35.520]  And we just continue to battle those on their goals to shut us down
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:39.680]  They've said that but your purchase of the products keeps it going and you know, I explained something
[1:43:39.680 --> 1:43:43.840]  I know these cell phones are evil. I know they track us another controllers, but they have a lot of
[1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:49.280]  Uses against the globalist that we can actually you know turn their evil towards good
[1:43:50.400 --> 1:43:52.480]  But the whole big tech system is designed
[1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:57.680]  Where you have like a $500 phone, but it goes into a hundred million dollar system
[1:43:58.240 --> 1:44:01.680]  of apps and and satellites and control systems
[1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:05.200]  We don't have a system where I can dial off a phone
[1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:08.960]  into satellite uplinks and radio systems and video
[1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:12.560]  Compressing units and streaming units. It's all here
[1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:17.040]  I don't want to exaggerate. Let me be be very conservative
[1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:20.480]  There's about 10 million dollars worth of equipment
[1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:26.320]  That we've had to buy since the platforming to do all of this once we lost all those services
[1:44:27.200 --> 1:44:29.200]  10 million dollars worth
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:33.520]  We had 300 thousand dollars of equipment come in just the other day for something else being to do
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:39.440]  So you think oh your phone's incredible. It's it dials into mountains of technology
[1:44:39.760 --> 1:44:44.880]  So they act like oh all the technologies in your phone. Oh, it's so great and stuff has gotten miniaturized, but
[1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:50.160]  When you don't have connections to all that other stuff, it's
[1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:53.040]  doesn't work
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:44:58.080]  So we built our own system because of their suppression. We already had a lot of it. That was your money
[1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:02.560]  You did that always the wrong area is that it's why it takes a lot of money to beat their lawsuits
[1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:07.760]  To have our own infrastructure to have our own legal have our own crew to have our own camera people everything
[1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:11.120]  Have our own journalists or own writers. We're really fighting as hard as we can
[1:45:11.360 --> 1:45:15.600]  So go to info or store.com today. Do your Christmas shopping. I want to thank you all for the support
[1:45:15.840 --> 1:45:20.480]  I called for your support yesterday a lot of support came in if we got support like that for two weeks
[1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:23.760]  I'd have a monkey off my back to pay the bills for months
[1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:27.280]  But you guys come through for a day or so and then boom, it's right back to
[1:45:27.680 --> 1:45:31.760]  I'm having to like spend half my time trying to raise money, which I'm not bitching. I'm not a victim
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:37.200]  I'm just saying would you rather keep me in the field fighting or two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon
[1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:41.920]  Jacking around with bill keeping and I get this part of business, but this is not a business
[1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:43.120]  I'm in a war
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:45.440]  But I am spending most of my time jacking
[1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:50.640]  We're trying to make the money and ensure it taught me like here's the fat here get a better deal there
[1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:54.960]  I've a much better businessman than I used to not having as much money coming in here, but
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:00.080]  I want to stay in the fight. So thank you for keeping me in the fight and I salute you and I thank you
[1:46:00.080 --> 1:46:05.120]  All right, Heather in Louisiana. You're a trooper. You've been holding. I really appreciate you go ahead
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:10.560]  Hi, I like that. Thank you for taking my call been listening to you since early 2000
[1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:13.920]  Um, and we all appreciate what you do. We know you're risking your life
[1:46:14.480 --> 1:46:16.480]  Uh, just really grateful for you out there
[1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:20.480]  1776 1776
[1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:25.920]  Yes, right, sorry, um, but I want to talk about our uh,
[1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:30.800]  Militias, I just feel like we need to be prepared. There's not a whole lot of information out there for you know
[1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:35.040]  Just a common man to get involved with militias. Would you happen to have any information on that?
[1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:40.080]  I believe the militia is constitutional. I believe it's great
[1:46:40.160 --> 1:46:44.720]  I believe it's like the civil defense in modern times and I believe that we should normalize it
[1:46:45.040 --> 1:46:50.240]  And you see the open carry groups out there defending property like call written house. That is the true image of the militia
[1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:52.240]  That's why they're demonizing it
[1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:57.040]  Uh, I would be careful though in certain areas. They want you to go on secret missions or stuff
[1:46:57.360 --> 1:46:59.920]  Sometimes feds try to lead you into bad operations
[1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:04.720]  But if the idea of the militia is absolutely key and so I think we should all promote the militia
[1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:10.240]  As really a civil defense group for hurricanes tornadoes, but also against lawlessness
[1:47:10.720 --> 1:47:14.960]  Uh with what is coming and uh, I mean, I think the second amendment's essential
[1:47:14.960 --> 1:47:19.200]  So that's where I stand. So the second amendment's not just the right to keep their arms. It's it's meaning
[1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:24.560]  On top of that, we should have a well regulated by regulation. They mean well trained
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:27.920]  Uh groups on top of it because we are the civil defense
[1:47:28.880 --> 1:47:32.080]  That's right. That's right. I have faith that everything's going to work out with trump
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:37.840]  But if it doesn't I feel like we need to start sending people to dc to surround the white house to protect trump for whatever
[1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:43.760]  Is about to go down, you know what I'm saying? I just feel like I totally agree. We need everybody to pick a weekend to pick a day
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:48.800]  Everybody needs to be around that white house supporting it. They need to see patriots in the streets of dc
[1:47:50.240 --> 1:47:56.000]  Supreme court is so scared about rioting. Do they not understand that if things continue there's going to be a civil war
[1:47:56.080 --> 1:47:59.760]  Like I well, that's roberts getting a call from holder that's got all the
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:05.840]  And obama that knows about him and his kidnapped kids and how his how his adopted kids were kidnapped reportedly
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:10.960]  And so yeah, he's on a very short chain and so he's there going we got to do this
[1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:12.960]  We got to do this and so he's a big problem
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:18.960]  Yeah, if they don't do anything about this, I say we need to just have a civil war because there's no way we'll survive on your
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:19.520]  bite
[1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:24.080]  It's not about us. It's about future generations. We need to make moves now sacrifice our lives
[1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:29.200]  Well, I know people are ready to fight and that's what scares the enemy. My issue is and thank you for the call. God bless you, Heather
[1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:35.760]  I wouldn't even call it a civil war. I mean, this is a foreign occupation with collaborators. So this is a
[1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:43.200]  Recapturing of America operation. So I don't I think I think there are a lot of forces that aren't going to put up with this
[1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:47.120]  The chai comms pissing on us. I mean America has lost some foreign wars
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:51.440]  We shouldn't have been it but we never lost a war where somebody started it and we were under attack and so
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:53.200]  um
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:54.480]  One way or another
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:58.240]  We're going to end up bringing this country back to where it was because if we don't fight now
[1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:00.960]  It's going to get so bad. We'll be forced to later and I just
[1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:06.880]  Just want to push back against these satanic pedophiles. All right up next. Let's go ahead and talk to
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:10.960]  Josh in alabama. Josh. Thank you sir. Go ahead
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:14.240]  Yeah, hey Alex. How's it going?
[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:19.760]  Man, I tell you it's an incredible time. I mean trump cancelling biden's transition braving for the pentagon. It's a big signal
[1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:25.520]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about this vaccine though real quick because I did like a little thought experiment on it
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:26.640]  and I'm like
[1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:27.840]  If I was them
[1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:28.960]  I know
[1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:32.880]  That not everybody is going to take this but they really want everybody to have it
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:39.520]  So what's the point in putting hiv into it or putting mechanisms like hiv into the vaccine?
[1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:43.200]  Well, what does hiv do it spreads through sexual contact?
[1:49:43.440 --> 1:49:47.920]  So all you got to do is have sex with somebody who's been vaccinated. Boom. Now you've been vaccinated
[1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:54.480]  Incredibly smart statement. I said that the other day that there's a lot of evidence showing this is a live mRNA vaccine
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:49:59.440]  That it triggers dormant viruses in the gene code because they've discovered all these viruses
[1:49:59.440 --> 1:50:07.200]  We beat before from ancient times are in there and they believe that these mRNA vaccines may trigger ancient viruses to be released
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:09.360]  Not just current ones
[1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:11.840]  Yeah
[1:50:11.840 --> 1:50:14.080]  Do you believe that how diabolical is this?
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:19.600]  I don't know but whenever I whenever I thought that it was like in a eureka moment. I was like, oh my god
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:21.360]  That's how they're gonna do it
[1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:26.000]  Why would you put why would you put hiv in it that the brother that's god's spirit?
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:29.200]  You know this intelligence that you've got the intelligence. I have it's not us
[1:50:29.520 --> 1:50:33.440]  It literally when you feel that eureka it's you've gotten a transmission. Isn't that amazing?
[1:50:34.880 --> 1:50:36.880]  Oh, it's incredible actually
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:41.600]  How many other transmissions are you getting brother? I know i'm getting a lot more these days
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:47.680]  Well, the uh, you know, we're starting to see all the news come out of uh, dc right now and uh
[1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:50.640]  I think that's got everybody on their toes because
[1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:55.040]  Something's definitely going to go down. Um twitter's blowing up right now
[1:50:55.600 --> 1:51:00.720]  And even ali ali on like I think tuesday or wednesday he tweeted out friday
[1:51:00.800 --> 1:51:03.200]  But that was that was the only thing his tweet said was friday
[1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:06.800]  It's so it's all coming together
[1:51:08.080 --> 1:51:12.560]  I know this they're making a major genetic move on us with sterilants and weapons
[1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:18.960]  I don't care if you're black white hispanic. It's targeting everybody. I've looked at it top virologist have it's particularly bad
[1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:20.960]  The mrna vaccine for black people
[1:51:21.600 --> 1:51:23.600]  That's just who they always go after
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:27.680]  But it goes after everybody and it's really really really really bad news, but
[1:51:28.400 --> 1:51:31.680]  Um, you know, we're here brother and we're fighting at josh anything else
[1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:38.720]  Uh, no, that's really it alexon. Thanks for taking my call man. I appreciate you brother
[1:51:38.720 --> 1:51:43.440]  You know, I wasn't trying to look gangster here. I'm like down to three o'clock here on my shirt almost all the way
[1:51:43.440 --> 1:51:44.640]  I'm button
[1:51:44.640 --> 1:51:47.360]  Stuff is so crazy right now. All right, we're gonna go to break
[1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:51.120]  And we're gonna talk to uh ron in new york
[1:51:52.160 --> 1:51:57.360]  And a few other callers and then we've got david ikes son coming on a new film the premiere and we got some of the clips of it
[1:51:57.840 --> 1:51:59.840]  Coming up and I did three hours on the
[1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:05.760]  New program we're doing weekday mornings 8 a.m. To 11 a.m
[1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:09.200]  That's a national journal like c-spans and a washington journal
[1:52:09.680 --> 1:52:12.080]  And then we've also got a lot of other stuff coming up today
[1:52:12.480 --> 1:52:15.840]  I've already agreed to another interview this afternoon. I may have to cancel that though
[1:52:16.720 --> 1:52:18.080]  because we
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:23.920]  I'm here, but I'm getting a little tired because this isn't like a regular show where I'm or a regular senator getting up
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:29.200]  Just reading off of script. I'm here taking your calls covering news interfacing with it all and
[1:52:29.760 --> 1:52:31.760]  I am getting a little exhausted, but it's okay
[1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:36.960]  Our number three of this transmission straight ahead news wars dot com
[1:52:39.440 --> 1:52:42.960]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left
[1:52:43.200 --> 1:52:47.280]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept
[1:52:47.520 --> 1:52:51.760]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:56.160]  Buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store dot com
[1:52:56.160 --> 1:53:03.040]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease
[1:53:03.680 --> 1:53:09.280]  Triglyceride levels decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:17.760]  Responses in joints and the digestive system recent studies have suggested that high epa and dha fish oil
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:24.160]  Can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells
[1:53:24.160 --> 1:53:32.800]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality
[1:53:33.040 --> 1:53:38.960]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend family member or yourself at info wars store dot com
[1:53:40.240 --> 1:53:46.240]  The pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a
[1:53:46.800 --> 1:53:52.560]  Planetary universal income which of course the united nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:57.040]  And finally a chip under your skin. It's all now completely official part of the
[1:53:57.440 --> 1:54:01.040]  UN great reset of the debos group and claus schwaab
[1:54:01.520 --> 1:54:07.280]  All officially written about in hundreds of books my schwaab and rock n feller foundation all the rest of them at 10 to 21
[1:54:07.440 --> 1:54:14.320]  At 20 30 it's here and only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all
[1:54:14.320 --> 1:54:21.120]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle the first evil and stopping
[1:54:21.520 --> 1:54:27.440]  Abortion we must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are not expendable
[1:54:27.760 --> 1:54:32.480]  That we are not disposable that we are essential until we do that
[1:54:32.880 --> 1:54:37.840]  We are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic god-given human rights now
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:46.160]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  Oh
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  Yeah, I tried to sign
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:41.600]  America on the eve of its first vaccinations against covid 19
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:44.960]  The first vials of the phyzer vaccine being put into place
[1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:52.640]  Workers at the phyzer plant near kalamazoo, michigan taking them out of the subzero freezers placing them in boxes packed with dry ice
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:56:00.640]  Ups and fedex hauling the first truckloads of the vaccine out from that plant the first planes carrying the potential life-saving cargo
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:06.960]  Landing in louisville and memphis. This is total absolute triple admission
[1:56:07.520 --> 1:56:15.600]  By the australian government of what we've known from the indian scientist and the german scientist and the african scientist
[1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:19.760]  And the u.s. Scientist and the canadian scientist and the discoverer
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:22.480]  of the hiv virus
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:26.000]  That when you scan the covid 19 virus
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:32.240]  It has had five viruses cut into it one of them hiv and the government
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:35.280]  Just came out and halted
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:38.240]  their mRNA vaccine
[1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:39.840]  because
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:41.440]  When you take it
[1:56:41.440 --> 1:56:46.480]  You then test positive for hiv. Did you hear what I just said?
[1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:49.920]  You test positive for hiv
[1:56:49.920 --> 1:56:56.400]  All he really wanted for christmas was a local vaccine, but the university of queensland vaccine
[1:56:57.280 --> 1:57:05.280]  Will not be able to proceed. 50 million plan doses scrapped after triggering false positive results for hiv
[1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:10.480]  australia expects to start vaccination next march and to have its whole population
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:16.000]  Inoculated by the end of the year that these were false positives
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:21.600]  Positives I find a cover story. I think they were giving people
[1:57:22.240 --> 1:57:24.240]  uh hiv in these uh
[1:57:24.640 --> 1:57:26.640]  franken shots covid 19
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:29.600]  Has hiv dna
[1:57:30.400 --> 1:57:32.960]  genetically engineered right into it
[1:57:33.680 --> 1:57:35.680]  and that was uh
[1:57:35.760 --> 1:57:37.040]  accomplished
[1:57:37.040 --> 1:57:39.760]  By the wuhan bsl4
[1:57:40.640 --> 1:57:42.640]  Which is china's fort detrick
[1:57:42.640 --> 1:57:46.800]  sending a scientist down to australia
[1:57:47.440 --> 1:57:51.360]  to work with the australian health board on
[1:57:52.080 --> 1:57:54.080]  a dna genetically engineering
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:57:56.240]  um
[1:57:56.240 --> 1:57:58.000]  the hiv
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  into sars the um
[1:58:00.560 --> 1:58:02.400]  statement coming out
[1:58:02.400 --> 1:58:08.320]  Is by the director of the australian health board right? That's the exact same people
[1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:12.640]  Who dna genetically engineered hiv?
[1:58:13.360 --> 1:58:17.280]  uh into uh uh sars that was taken back
[1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:19.360]  to the uh uh
[1:58:19.360 --> 1:58:21.360]  wuhan bsl4
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:29.840]  China's fort detrick and turned into covid 19 now there were four cases of bell's palsy that occurred in the group that received the vaccine
[1:58:30.160 --> 1:58:34.880]  Bell's palsy has a condition that causes temporary weakness or paralysis certain muscles in the face
[1:58:34.880 --> 1:58:41.680]  It is not clear that there is a connection to the vaccine in your view america first as the president might call it not the right approach
[1:58:41.920 --> 1:58:43.920]  Well the extreme idea that
[1:58:44.400 --> 1:58:50.400]  Uh, everybody should die until we have the very last american vaccinated
[1:58:50.960 --> 1:58:52.400]  Uh, that's
[1:58:52.400 --> 1:59:00.640]  Hardly the appropriate response a new pew research poll out last week showed that only 60 of the american people say they intend to get
[1:59:00.640 --> 1:59:05.600]  vaccinated um that includes uh less than half of black americans
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:11.280]  How worried are you about the reluctance of americans to take a vaccine?
[1:59:11.840 --> 1:59:13.840]  particularly among minority communities
[1:59:14.080 --> 1:59:16.880]  I think we have a real communications, uh
[1:59:17.680 --> 1:59:20.240]  challenge that you've got to find out who
[1:59:20.880 --> 1:59:22.880]  Uh, do people trust
[1:59:22.880 --> 1:59:24.880]  You know for some jobs
[1:59:24.880 --> 1:59:31.280]  Uh, like working in a nursing home the government could decide that it's important for those people to be vaccinated because that'll
[1:59:31.760 --> 1:59:34.480]  Uh, save a lot of lives and so
[1:59:35.120 --> 1:59:40.480]  Uh, the track record will be developed and I think we'll get over the 70 percent
[1:59:41.200 --> 1:59:46.080]  Of the dystopias are building a dystopia for us because it's easier to manage and they like it
[1:59:48.480 --> 1:59:50.480]  Hey alex how you doing man?
[1:59:50.800 --> 1:59:52.960]  Is this the guy that called in about living defense?
[1:59:52.960 --> 1:59:57.280]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've been trying to get a hold of you since monday
[1:59:57.680 --> 2:00:01.680]  When I heard you got that fresh shipment of living defense in from utah
[2:00:02.320 --> 2:00:05.600]  I said man, I gotta get on that show and give him an update
[2:00:05.920 --> 2:00:10.800]  I said if I ever get a chance to be on alex stone show, I'm gonna tell the world
[2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:17.520]  About living defense and what it did for me personally. Now look i'm 64 years old going on 20
[2:00:17.520 --> 2:00:23.520]  Thanks to this info for store products. And by the way, I bought 800 dollars worth the other night
[2:00:23.600 --> 2:00:27.920]  So I'm doing what I can brother. So what my my contingency is
[2:00:27.920 --> 2:00:33.680]  Why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense?
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:40.160]  Now you gotta follow that up with the micro zx. I learned that so it's like god working is so amazing
[2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:45.360]  We didn't know we didn't screen your call. We had no idea and I go to you a year later
[2:00:45.360 --> 2:00:48.240]  And you're here telling people about living defense living defense living defense
[2:01:15.360 --> 2:01:21.920]  Our nation is going through a crisis which threatens its very future as free and democratic
[2:01:23.840 --> 2:01:26.880]  The worldwide spread of marxist materialism
[2:01:27.440 --> 2:01:32.240]  Which has already brought destruction and death to the lives of so many
[2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:37.600]  And which has threatened the foundations of our nation for decades
[2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:42.800]  And now seems to seize the governing power over our nation
[2:01:42.800 --> 2:01:46.960]  To attain economic gains
[2:01:47.840 --> 2:01:54.560]  We as a nation have permitted ourselves to become dependent upon the chinese communist party
[2:01:55.600 --> 2:02:00.080]  An ideology totally opposed to the christian foundations
[2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:06.560]  Upon which families and our nation remain safe and prosper
[2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:11.920]  I speak of the united states of america
[2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:21.200]  But evidently many other nations are in the throes of a similar most alarming crisis
[2:02:24.080 --> 2:02:29.600]  Then there is the mysterious wuhan virus about whose nature and prevention
[2:02:30.400 --> 2:02:34.080]  The mass media daily give us conflicting information
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:37.920]  What is clear however
[2:02:39.200 --> 2:02:42.160]  Is that it has been used by certain forces
[2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:46.640]  Enemical to families and to the freedom of nations
[2:02:48.240 --> 2:02:50.240]  To advance their evil agenda
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:58.240]  These forces tell us that we are now the subjects of the so-called great reset
[2:02:59.600 --> 2:03:01.600]  The new normal
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:10.320]  Which is dictated to us by their manipulation of citizens and nations through ignorance and fear
[2:03:12.720 --> 2:03:17.680]  Now we are supposed to find in a disease and its prevention
[2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:21.840]  The way to understand and direct our lives
[2:03:21.840 --> 2:03:31.120]  Rather than in god and in his plan for our salvation
[2:03:32.880 --> 2:03:36.960]  I haven't talked to a single nurse who has said that they want to take the vaccination
[2:03:36.960 --> 2:03:38.640]  None of us want to have it
[2:03:38.640 --> 2:03:42.480]  None of us want to be vaccinated with this covid vaccine
[2:03:42.480 --> 2:03:47.920]  Number one it hasn't had enough people to know what the actual reactions are going to be
[2:03:48.480 --> 2:03:50.640]  And two we don't need to know if it's really that safe
[2:03:50.640 --> 2:03:54.800]  And by the way in national polls two-thirds of people say they don't want to take it
[2:03:54.800 --> 2:03:58.640]  They have polls of firefighter groups, police, medical groups even higher numbers don't
[2:03:58.640 --> 2:04:01.680]  But then the media app track it's weirder than everyone's going to take it
[2:04:01.680 --> 2:04:03.200]  That's total gaslighting
[2:04:03.200 --> 2:04:05.360]  When I talk to nurses and doctors I know
[2:04:05.360 --> 2:04:08.000]  The military I know that have been subjected to vaccines
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:12.080]  They're the biggest uh critics of them because they know the pitfalls
[2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:14.480]  And that's the regular vaccines contamination
[2:04:15.040 --> 2:04:17.200]  Side effects autoimmune responses
[2:04:17.200 --> 2:04:19.760]  But they're not saying with these mRNA vaccines
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:21.840]  They're going to reprogram the mitochondria
[2:04:21.840 --> 2:04:24.000]  That's not a vaccine that's a mutagenic
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:25.920]  It changes it changes your body
[2:04:25.920 --> 2:04:30.240]  It absolutely changes your body and what your body can do 100%
[2:04:30.240 --> 2:04:34.080]  And like I said I haven't talked to a single nurse who says that they want that vaccine
[2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:37.920]  And the nurses that they're showing on tv that are taking those vaccines
[2:04:37.920 --> 2:04:41.600]  You can't tell me that they either aren't being paid a lot of money
[2:04:41.600 --> 2:04:43.200]  Because that's what they are doing
[2:04:43.200 --> 2:04:45.360]  They're wanting to pay us to number one
[2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:49.920]  Take the vaccine and then give us a lot of time off when we do take the vaccine
[2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:52.240]  So if it's a normal vaccine why are you paying us
[2:04:52.240 --> 2:04:54.080]  And why are you giving us a lot of time off
[2:04:54.080 --> 2:04:57.440]  And by the way have you noticed the image not just here but worldwide
[2:04:57.440 --> 2:05:00.880]  It's a black nurse giving a black woman the vaccine
[2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:02.160]  And it's the same thing in print
[2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:05.600]  In shoot after shoot not just these two black women
[2:05:05.600 --> 2:05:07.200]  It's other black women
[2:05:07.200 --> 2:05:10.080]  Because black folks statistically have learned about Tuskegee
[2:05:10.640 --> 2:05:12.480]  And learned about secret experimentation
[2:05:12.480 --> 2:05:14.160]  And so they're saying they're not going to do it
[2:05:14.160 --> 2:05:17.200]  And so they're literally showing black people taking the shot
[2:05:17.200 --> 2:05:18.400]  Hoping black folks taking it
[2:05:18.400 --> 2:05:19.680]  If this is diabolical
[2:05:19.680 --> 2:05:21.200]  Yeah it's really sad
[2:05:21.200 --> 2:05:23.840]  And it's like so many people are so brainwashed
[2:05:23.840 --> 2:05:26.160]  Into watching what they see on tv
[2:05:26.160 --> 2:05:29.520]  Instead of seeing what's happening in the world around them
[2:05:29.520 --> 2:05:32.000]  That they don't understand or they don't realize
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:37.040]  Or they're just so incapacitated by what's being shown on tv that they think it's real
[2:05:37.040 --> 2:05:38.400]  And it's not real
[2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:40.240]  Like if you talk to a real person
[2:05:40.240 --> 2:05:41.360]  A real nurse
[2:05:41.360 --> 2:05:42.640]  A real doctor
[2:05:42.640 --> 2:05:44.560]  Like you said a real firefighter
[2:05:44.560 --> 2:05:46.560]  They're going to tell you what's really going on
[2:05:46.560 --> 2:05:48.240]  Well they call flu and pneumonia deaths
[2:05:48.880 --> 2:05:49.280]  COVID
[2:05:49.280 --> 2:05:50.800]  And we all know people really die of the flu
[2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:51.760]  They die of pneumonia
[2:05:51.760 --> 2:05:52.480]  My god it's real
[2:05:52.480 --> 2:05:53.520]  They just hear they have it
[2:05:53.520 --> 2:05:55.280]  So oh I better be in the hospital
[2:05:55.280 --> 2:05:58.160]  And so for a cough and a fever you're now in the hospital
[2:05:58.160 --> 2:05:59.840]  No and see it's not necessary
[2:05:59.840 --> 2:06:01.280]  These people that are in the COVID unit
[2:06:01.280 --> 2:06:03.040]  They don't even need to be there
[2:06:03.040 --> 2:06:04.800]  They could be recovering at home
[2:06:04.800 --> 2:06:06.480]  And these people with COVID
[2:06:06.480 --> 2:06:08.800]  I mean for the most part
[2:06:08.800 --> 2:06:11.440]  It's not the COVID that they're in the hospital for
[2:06:11.440 --> 2:06:13.520]  They have an underlying condition
[2:06:13.520 --> 2:06:15.600]  That's causing them to be hospitalized
[2:06:15.600 --> 2:06:18.400]  It's not the COVID that's causing the death
[2:06:18.400 --> 2:06:20.160]  Well I read this weekend
[2:06:20.160 --> 2:06:21.760]  This weekend in my hotel room in DC
[2:06:22.480 --> 2:06:24.080]  Three more studies that just came out
[2:06:24.080 --> 2:06:26.240]  About prestigious medical facilities
[2:06:26.240 --> 2:06:29.280]  80% of hospitalized COVID patients
[2:06:29.840 --> 2:06:32.000]  Were vitamin D3 deficient
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:36.240]  Another was no one study shows no one has died
[2:06:36.240 --> 2:06:37.680]  Who was not deficient
[2:06:37.680 --> 2:06:38.560]  These are facts
[2:06:38.560 --> 2:06:40.800]  Now there it is they found it
[2:06:40.800 --> 2:06:44.480]  80% of COVID-19 patients in a study had vitamin D deficiency
[2:06:44.480 --> 2:06:47.520]  And something like 46% of Americans have it
[2:06:47.520 --> 2:06:50.160]  And again the FDA says a very low level is above
[2:06:50.160 --> 2:07:14.960]  They keep lowering recommended daily analysis
[2:07:14.960 --> 2:07:17.440]  Now in the video you can see the UMC healthcare worker
[2:07:17.440 --> 2:07:19.200]  With his sleeve rolled up
[2:07:19.200 --> 2:07:21.440]  But when it comes time for the injection
[2:07:21.440 --> 2:07:23.120]  Look at the top of the syringe
[2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:25.440]  It appears the person administering the shot
[2:07:25.440 --> 2:07:27.920]  Doesn't really push down on the plunger
[2:07:27.920 --> 2:07:30.720]  It actually looks like the plunger is already depressed
[2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:33.840]  Now our viewers wondering whether the worker
[2:07:33.840 --> 2:07:35.520]  Received the vaccine at all
[2:07:36.160 --> 2:07:39.280]  Now for comparison here is a look at the other
[2:07:39.280 --> 2:07:41.040]  One of the other injections administered
[2:07:41.040 --> 2:07:42.800]  Just moments later to a woman
[2:07:42.800 --> 2:07:45.840]  And you can see this plunger is clearly pushed down
[2:07:45.840 --> 2:07:46.720]  All the way
[2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:49.120]  And then when we show them to you side by side
[2:07:49.120 --> 2:07:50.320]  You might notice a difference
[2:07:51.120 --> 2:07:54.080]  KTSM reached out to UMC for comment this evening
[2:07:54.080 --> 2:07:56.960]  And shared the rough footage that we captured today
[2:07:56.960 --> 2:08:00.000]  A spokesperson maintains all five healthcare workers
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.480]  Were given full doses of the vaccine
[2:08:02.480 --> 2:08:05.440]  But the hospital is taking a closer look at our video
[2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:09.040]  Man look at how these globalists bend over backwards
[2:08:09.040 --> 2:08:10.880]  To lie to us and sell us on their crap
[2:08:11.520 --> 2:08:13.440]  It came out 10 years ago in one in Guardian
[2:08:13.440 --> 2:08:15.840]  That the rich Chinese, the rich Brits, the rich Germans
[2:08:15.840 --> 2:08:17.600]  And others get clean vaccines
[2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:19.440]  And those still have side effects
[2:08:19.440 --> 2:08:20.960]  So joining us is Jamie Eich
[2:08:20.960 --> 2:08:22.080]  Next segment
[2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:25.360]  Got a big new film out you can find at iconic.com
[2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:26.640]  And as soon as it's out and available
[2:08:26.640 --> 2:08:28.400]  We'll be posting it at band.video
[2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:29.280]  They provided it to us
[2:08:29.280 --> 2:08:31.280]  But we're having trouble getting it uploaded
[2:08:31.280 --> 2:08:31.840]  But it doesn't matter
[2:08:31.840 --> 2:08:32.720]  It's a great new film
[2:08:34.240 --> 2:08:35.840]  Named informed consent
[2:08:35.840 --> 2:08:39.840]  David Eich has been on fire even more than usual
[2:08:40.880 --> 2:08:42.880]  And this is a very important film
[2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:44.320]  To fight against this great tyranny
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:47.360]  That is coming down upon us right now
[2:08:47.360 --> 2:08:48.160]  So we'll go to break
[2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:49.200]  We'll come back with that
[2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:51.360]  But let me go ahead and go back here a few minutes
[2:08:52.240 --> 2:08:55.200]  And let me get to Tennessee
[2:08:55.200 --> 2:08:56.560]  With the nurse taking the vaccine
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:08:58.400]  Collapsing a few minutes later
[2:08:58.960 --> 2:09:00.640]  Because let's go ahead and roll the audio
[2:09:00.640 --> 2:09:01.760]  In the video that actually happened
[2:09:03.760 --> 2:09:05.120]  So all of my staff
[2:09:06.800 --> 2:09:08.720]  We are excited to get the vaccine
[2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:12.160]  We are in the COVID unit
[2:09:12.160 --> 2:09:14.960]  So therefore you know my team will be getting
[2:09:15.600 --> 2:09:18.000]  First chances to get the vaccine
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:23.280]  And I know that it's really
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:25.840]  I'm sorry I'm feeling really dizzy
[2:09:27.600 --> 2:09:28.160]  It's okay
[2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:30.480]  There's a big change happening now
[2:09:30.480 --> 2:09:31.280]  I'm sorry
[2:09:31.840 --> 2:09:34.720]  Ty, your cells are being taken over
[2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:36.400]  You'll never have children goodbye
[2:09:37.200 --> 2:09:39.120]  Bill Gates loves you all
[2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:42.960]  Oh, the power we do it out of the open
[2:09:42.960 --> 2:09:44.160]  They love it
[2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:45.600]  We kill them openly
[2:09:45.600 --> 2:09:47.600]  Oh, it's so liberal
[2:09:48.800 --> 2:09:50.000]  Just like the babies
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:51.520]  Of their brains, the autistic
[2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:02.320]  Of course they give these to the babies
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:03.680]  We ought to queue that up for later
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:06.960]  Nurses have reported it came in the medical journals
[2:10:06.960 --> 2:10:08.160]  They give babies vaccines
[2:10:08.160 --> 2:10:09.920]  And they convulse and die
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:11.360]  So then they defibrillate them
[2:10:12.320 --> 2:10:13.680]  And the bioethics board say
[2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:14.720]  Go ahead and kill them
[2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:16.080]  They give them a shot
[2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:17.120]  They die
[2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:18.960]  Then they resuscitate them
[2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:20.720]  Because it's liberal
[2:10:20.720 --> 2:10:21.760]  It's liberal
[2:10:21.760 --> 2:10:24.880]  Like Tim Cook's death camps that Apple runs in China
[2:10:24.880 --> 2:10:26.480]  It's liberal
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:28.560]  And no one's going to do anything about it
[2:10:29.600 --> 2:10:30.400]  You're going to submit
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:32.160]  You're going to take your mRNA vaccine
[2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:34.320]  You're going to have horrible cancer
[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:35.520]  And die and love it, okay
[2:10:36.080 --> 2:10:37.520]  Remember, be liberal
[2:10:37.520 --> 2:10:38.560]  You're a white supremacist
[2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:39.760]  If you don't take the shot and die
[2:10:39.760 --> 2:10:40.720]  Especially if you're black
[2:10:41.440 --> 2:10:42.880]  Take your shots
[2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:44.000]  Say bye-bye
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:44.720]  We'll be right back
[2:10:47.760 --> 2:10:49.520]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut
[2:10:49.520 --> 2:10:50.000]  You're on the air
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:50.560]  Thanks for holding
[2:10:50.560 --> 2:10:51.600]  Hey, hello, can you hear me?
[2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:52.320]  I sure can, sir
[2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:52.720]  Thank you
[2:10:52.720 --> 2:10:53.440]  Hey, Alex
[2:10:53.440 --> 2:10:54.320]  Before I start, man
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:10:56.480]  I just wanted to talk to you, bro
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:10:59.520]  And it's a pleasure to be talking right now here, man
[2:10:59.520 --> 2:11:00.960]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:02.640]  Hi, I'm Juan from New Brink, Connecticut
[2:11:02.640 --> 2:11:04.640]  And I just want to plug in
[2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:06.000]  I'm a truck driver
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:08.080]  And two before us have changed
[2:11:08.080 --> 2:11:09.120]  The way I drive
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:11.440]  Me and my brothers that drive
[2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:12.720]  There's a couple of us
[2:11:12.720 --> 2:11:16.080]  We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans
[2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:20.160]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rola
[2:11:20.160 --> 2:11:21.520]  And I have lost weight
[2:11:21.520 --> 2:11:23.120]  Because I stopped drinking all that sugar
[2:11:23.120 --> 2:11:24.880]  And I just want to thank you for that, man
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:25.440]  Well, brother
[2:11:25.440 --> 2:11:27.600]  We put more in this than any other
[2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:30.480]  Long-term high-quality energy powder there is
[2:11:30.480 --> 2:11:32.800]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:33.840]  He didn't want his name on it
[2:11:33.840 --> 2:11:35.280]  Because obviously the political issues
[2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:37.040]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation
[2:11:37.040 --> 2:11:38.000]  Just for the design of it
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:40.080]  And we believe it is the best, strongest
[2:11:40.080 --> 2:11:42.000]  But healthiest energy out there
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:43.760]  And you're saying that it's made your life better
[2:11:43.760 --> 2:11:44.560]  So that means a lot to me
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:44.880]  Thank you
[2:11:44.880 --> 2:11:46.720]  To all your truck drivers, we love you

[2:13:50.160 --> 2:13:52.240]  What Jamie plans to do with Iconic

[2:14:05.920 --> 2:14:07.120]  Unnatural in July
[2:14:07.120 --> 2:14:08.800]  Which looks like the connections
[2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:10.400]  Between wireless radiation
[2:14:11.360 --> 2:14:13.280]  And the variety of health and social problems
[2:14:13.280 --> 2:14:15.200]  The second film, Inform Consent
[2:14:15.200 --> 2:14:16.560]  Dropping the Day

[2:14:17.680 --> 2:14:18.560]  Is now available
[2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:20.240]  And covers the subject of vaccines
[2:14:20.240 --> 2:14:21.520]  Their history, safety
[2:14:21.520 --> 2:14:22.400]  Or lack of safety
[2:14:22.400 --> 2:14:24.160]  And what the upcoming COVID vaccine
[2:14:24.160 --> 2:14:25.680]  Could mean for you and the rest of the world
[2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:26.960]  Iconic.com

[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:30.480]  I know the film is dropping today
[2:14:30.480 --> 2:14:32.800]  People can find it at Iconic.com
[2:14:32.800 --> 2:14:34.640]  Later it'll be posted to Bandai Video
[2:14:34.640 --> 2:14:35.760]  But man, I tell you
[2:14:35.760 --> 2:14:37.760]  This stuff is out in the open now
[2:14:37.760 --> 2:14:40.320]  Your dad's saying it was false testing 10 months ago
[2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:42.960]  Now even the inventors of it saying it's false testing
[2:14:42.960 --> 2:14:44.000]  What an insane time
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:45.040]  You've got the floor
[2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:46.960]  What do you want to impart to folks about what's happening?
[2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:49.600]  Well, I think as you say
[2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:51.440]  It's an absolutely crazy time
[2:14:51.440 --> 2:14:53.920]  I think it's a time that people like yourself
[2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:55.760]  People like my dad, Ron Paul
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:14:57.520]  All these people that have been speaking about
[2:14:58.240 --> 2:15:00.240]  What's happening now for years
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:02.080]  It's a time that you've warned about
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:04.080]  And you've warned about and you've warned about
[2:15:04.640 --> 2:15:05.680]  And now it's here
[2:15:05.680 --> 2:15:07.520]  And I think for myself
[2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:09.200]  Being quite a young person, I'm only 28
[2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:11.440]  I've been staggered by the reaction
[2:15:11.440 --> 2:15:13.200]  To what's happening of my generation
[2:15:13.200 --> 2:15:16.160]  I think I guess I was a bit more optimistic
[2:15:16.160 --> 2:15:17.040]  About my generation
[2:15:17.040 --> 2:15:19.520]  I thought we had a bit more now than we have
[2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:21.120]  I thought we'd have seen through the lies
[2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:23.120]  And the deception of what's happened
[2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:25.520]  And in the last six or seven months
[2:15:25.520 --> 2:15:27.360]  The amount of times I thought to myself
[2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:30.240]  That when this happens people will see it
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:32.480]  When this happens people will start to see through this
[2:15:32.480 --> 2:15:34.160]  And I've been quite disappointed
[2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:37.040]  That people haven't seen through it yet
[2:15:37.040 --> 2:15:40.640]  And that's the main reason behind making the film
[2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:44.480]  That you've mentioned is giving people a tool
[2:15:44.480 --> 2:15:46.800]  That they can go to when they want to have
[2:15:46.800 --> 2:15:48.240]  A bit of a discussion on vaccines
[2:15:48.240 --> 2:15:49.360]  And they want some balance
[2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:51.120]  They don't just want to hear the propaganda
[2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:52.720]  That they're going to hear from the mainstream media
[2:15:52.720 --> 2:15:54.080]  Which is that vaccines are brilliant
[2:15:54.080 --> 2:15:54.880]  And there's no risk
[2:15:54.880 --> 2:15:56.560]  And there's no potential side effects
[2:15:56.560 --> 2:15:58.320]  And there's not another side to the story
[2:15:58.320 --> 2:15:59.680]  That you should hear
[2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:02.720]  When, as yourself and other people know
[2:16:02.720 --> 2:16:04.800]  There's so many stories you hear
[2:16:04.800 --> 2:16:08.320]  Of side effects of, in very extreme cases
[2:16:08.320 --> 2:16:10.160]  Death as a result of vaccines
[2:16:10.160 --> 2:16:11.760]  So there's two sides to the story
[2:16:11.760 --> 2:16:15.040]  And I felt that particularly at this time
[2:16:15.040 --> 2:16:16.960]  There really needed to be something else out there
[2:16:16.960 --> 2:16:18.640]  That showed that other side
[2:16:18.640 --> 2:16:20.960]  Oh, you're definitely striking while the iron is hot
[2:16:20.960 --> 2:16:23.360]  And of course you're being somewhat conservative about this
[2:16:24.160 --> 2:16:26.800]  This is foreign multinational corporations
[2:16:26.800 --> 2:16:28.240]  Mainly based in China
[2:16:28.240 --> 2:16:29.840]  Who have a eugenics background
[2:16:29.840 --> 2:16:31.760]  Some like Bayer Nazi backgrounds
[2:16:31.760 --> 2:16:33.280]  That want to put in your body something
[2:16:33.280 --> 2:16:35.280]  They admit changes all your DNA
[2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:37.920]  And then they have liability protection if you get hurt
[2:16:37.920 --> 2:16:39.440]  And they make money off of it
[2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:41.600]  I mean, and they're using this as a political system
[2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:43.680]  To control us and to have a world ID
[2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:45.360]  I mean, this is about as evil as it gets
[2:16:46.560 --> 2:16:49.040]  It is, and I think that possibly is the problem
[2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:51.520]  When you speak to everyday people on the street
[2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:53.600]  I don't think they can quite comprehend
[2:16:53.600 --> 2:16:55.280]  How evil some people are
[2:16:55.280 --> 2:16:57.680]  I don't think they can quite get their head around
[2:16:57.680 --> 2:16:58.800]  Why people would want to do that
[2:16:58.800 --> 2:17:00.560]  I mean, you look at someone like Bill Gates
[2:17:00.560 --> 2:17:02.320]  That obviously we know is well behind this
[2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:03.520]  Behind a lot of it
[2:17:03.520 --> 2:17:04.640]  He's a multi-billionaire
[2:17:04.640 --> 2:17:07.760]  Why would he be concerned with controlling the world?
[2:17:07.760 --> 2:17:10.000]  Why shouldn't he just go and enjoy his money?
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.720]  I think that's a big issue that people like us have
[2:17:12.720 --> 2:17:15.040]  Is, I guess, convincing people that
[2:17:15.040 --> 2:17:17.120]  Yeah, there really is people out there that are that evil
[2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:18.160]  They do want your DNA
[2:17:18.160 --> 2:17:20.640]  They do want control of your kids, control of your mind
[2:17:20.640 --> 2:17:22.960]  And they won't stop until they get it
[2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:26.320]  And they're not going to stop until we stand up
[2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:29.360]  As a race, as a species, and stop them
[2:17:29.360 --> 2:17:30.960]  I mean, I've heard so many times
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:32.240]  I'm sure you have as well
[2:17:32.240 --> 2:17:34.800]  You've been asked the question is, when does this end?
[2:17:34.800 --> 2:17:36.960]  And the simple answer to that is
[2:17:36.960 --> 2:17:38.960]  It ends when we stop doing it
[2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:41.600]  Ends when we stop allowing them to control us
[2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:42.960]  You know, a bully can be bullied
[2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:44.960]  You know that's basically a Thomas Everson quote
[2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:46.960]  He was asked, how bad will tyrants get?
[2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:48.960]  How far will they push?
[2:17:48.960 --> 2:17:50.960]  And he said, exactly as far as you let them
[2:17:50.960 --> 2:17:52.960]  Yeah, absolutely
[2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:54.960]  A bully will only bully you until you hit them back
[2:17:54.960 --> 2:17:56.960]  And that's what we need to do
[2:17:56.960 --> 2:17:58.960]  That's what we need to do
[2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:00.960]  We need to beat them at their own game
[2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:02.960]  Which is, they've spent years
[2:18:02.960 --> 2:18:04.960]  I mean, you've obviously seen this in America at the moment
[2:18:04.960 --> 2:18:06.960]  They've spent years trying to polarise people
[2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:08.960]  Trying to divide people, divide and rule, divide and conquer
[2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:10.960]  Black against white, gay against straight
[2:18:10.960 --> 2:18:12.960]  Men against women
[2:18:12.960 --> 2:18:14.960]  And because they're absolutely terrified
[2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:16.960]  That when we put down those fault lines
[2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:18.960]  And realise that, okay
[2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:20.960]  There may be differences between us
[2:18:20.960 --> 2:18:22.960]  And that's great, because if everyone was the same
[2:18:22.960 --> 2:18:24.960]  The world would be pretty boring
[2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:26.960]  But they're after every single one of us
[2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:28.960]  And until we stand together, they're still going to be able to do that
[2:18:28.960 --> 2:18:30.960]  So it's time for us to stand together
[2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:32.960]  I mean, I don't know, I think you've been at some
[2:18:32.960 --> 2:18:34.960]  Protests in America as well, haven't you Alex?
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:36.960]  But I've been at some here in the UK
[2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:38.960]  And the diversity of people there
[2:18:38.960 --> 2:18:40.960]  Is every single walk of life
[2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:42.960]  That can see through this, that wants to stand up again
[2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:44.960]  We have huge gun rallies, anti-vaccine rallies
[2:18:44.960 --> 2:18:46.960]  All of it, the most diverse crowds ever
[2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:48.960]  And that scares the hell out of the establishment
[2:18:50.960 --> 2:18:52.960]  Yeah, those fault lines that they've tried to put in place
[2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:54.960]  They've tried so hard through the years
[2:18:54.960 --> 2:18:56.960]  To put them in place, and they're trying to get
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:18:58.960]  Even more minute, minute, minute fault lines
[2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:00.960]  Between people in smaller, smaller groups
[2:19:00.960 --> 2:19:02.960]  Because they're terrified of people standing together
[2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:04.960]  Because when they do
[2:19:04.960 --> 2:19:06.960]  And let's explain that, they claim they're liberals
[2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:08.960]  And want racial unity and all this
[2:19:08.960 --> 2:19:10.960]  But now they're making the colleges black, white, segregated
[2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:12.960]  Christian, Muslim, segregated
[2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:14.960]  The truth is they're creating division and hatred
[2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:16.960]  They're creating the separation
[2:19:16.960 --> 2:19:18.960]  On record, I mean, they are
[2:19:18.960 --> 2:19:20.960]  The opposite of Martin Luther King
[2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:22.960]  They are, yeah, it's reverse racism
[2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:24.960]  It's reverse racism, because
[2:19:24.960 --> 2:19:26.960]  When you're putting anyone
[2:19:26.960 --> 2:19:28.960]  Into any kind of category
[2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:30.960]  Because of their race, or their gender
[2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:32.960]  Or whatever it is
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:34.960]  You're giving, you're identifying them
[2:19:34.960 --> 2:19:36.960]  With that gender, or that race
[2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:38.960]  Rather than just looking them as a person
[2:19:38.960 --> 2:19:40.960]  As you say, Martin Luther King
[2:19:40.960 --> 2:19:42.960]  Judged someone by the content of their character
[2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:44.960]  Not the colour of their skin, and that goes both ways
[2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:46.960]  And, like you say there
[2:19:46.960 --> 2:19:48.960]  They're segregating people
[2:19:48.960 --> 2:19:50.960]  The colleges and the universities
[2:19:50.960 --> 2:19:52.960]  That seems to be where it's starting and in the schools
[2:19:52.960 --> 2:19:54.960]  And, as I've said
[2:19:54.960 --> 2:19:56.960]  In the film, is
[2:19:56.960 --> 2:19:58.960]  What are the people that are going through those institutions
[2:19:58.960 --> 2:20:00.960]  They're the adults of tomorrow
[2:20:00.960 --> 2:20:02.960]  And they're the people they want
[2:20:02.960 --> 2:20:04.960]  When their systems fall blown in
[2:20:04.960 --> 2:20:06.960]  They want these people to have been brought up
[2:20:06.960 --> 2:20:08.960]  Through their formative years, believing this is normal
[2:20:08.960 --> 2:20:10.960]  That's why they've got kids in schools wearing masks
[2:20:10.960 --> 2:20:12.960]  And they get to 15, 16, 17
[2:20:12.960 --> 2:20:14.960]  And become adults, they think this is normal
[2:20:14.960 --> 2:20:16.960]  They think taking forced inoculations
[2:20:16.960 --> 2:20:18.960]  Or tattling other neighbours
[2:20:18.960 --> 2:20:20.960]  This is an authoritarian revolution
[2:20:20.960 --> 2:20:22.960]  Your film fights it
[2:20:22.960 --> 2:20:24.960]  Your dad thinks there's a global awakening
[2:20:24.960 --> 2:20:26.960]  I do too, but you're saying you're actually disappointed
[2:20:26.960 --> 2:20:28.960]  I mean, you think the enemy's winning?
[2:20:28.960 --> 2:20:30.960]  No, I mean
[2:20:30.960 --> 2:20:32.960]  I don't really know, to be honest
[2:20:32.960 --> 2:20:34.960]  I've been very, very encouraged by
[2:20:34.960 --> 2:20:36.960]  The type of people that are standing up against this
[2:20:36.960 --> 2:20:38.960]  I've been, I think it's just the younger people
[2:20:38.960 --> 2:20:40.960]  And
[2:20:40.960 --> 2:20:42.960]  I guess it's because
[2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:44.960]  There's the whole, the talk of obviously restrictions
[2:20:44.960 --> 2:20:46.960]  If you don't have the vaccine
[2:20:46.960 --> 2:20:48.960]  Not being able to travel, not being able to go out
[2:20:48.960 --> 2:20:50.960]  Go to work, go to restaurants
[2:20:50.960 --> 2:20:52.960]  I think what they've tried to do in the last seven, eight months
[2:20:52.960 --> 2:20:54.960]  Is just break people
[2:20:54.960 --> 2:20:56.960]  Break people's will
[2:20:56.960 --> 2:20:58.960]  Get you to the point that you just go, you know what
[2:20:58.960 --> 2:21:00.960]  I don't want a vaccine, but if I can have my life back
[2:21:00.960 --> 2:21:02.960]  Then here's my arm
[2:21:02.960 --> 2:21:04.960]  You just said it, they know they said
[2:21:04.960 --> 2:21:06.960]  You've got to do it now, there'll be a rebellion, we beat it
[2:21:06.960 --> 2:21:08.960]  Do this, maybe not, well
[2:21:08.960 --> 2:21:10.960]  We want you to, they're getting the idea out there
[2:21:10.960 --> 2:21:12.960]  To condition people
[2:21:12.960 --> 2:21:14.960]  Yeah, they are, they leak stuff in the press all the time
[2:21:14.960 --> 2:21:16.960]  The Prime Minister here in the UK has said today
[2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:18.960]  I hope there's not going to be a
[2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:20.960]  Have to do a third lockdown, that's him telling you
[2:21:20.960 --> 2:21:22.960]  That there is going to be a third lockdown
[2:21:22.960 --> 2:21:24.960]  He's just warning you, he's planting that seed
[2:21:24.960 --> 2:21:26.960]  Because in other words, the lockdown they admit
[2:21:26.960 --> 2:21:28.960]  At the UN level never ends
[2:21:28.960 --> 2:21:30.960]  We need to call these crooks out for what they are
[2:21:30.960 --> 2:21:32.960]  A diabolical group of devils
[2:21:32.960 --> 2:21:34.960]  Stay there, we got Jamie Ike here
[2:21:34.960 --> 2:21:36.960]  And obviously, you know, we get big filmmakers
[2:21:36.960 --> 2:21:38.960]  On to talk about their films, we got to talk about
[2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:40.960]  Dad's stuff too, what's it like with David Ike
[2:21:40.960 --> 2:21:42.960]  Being your dad, I'm Alex Jones in FullWars.com
[2:21:42.960 --> 2:21:44.960]  Stay with us
[2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:46.960]  Imagine a dystopic novel
[2:21:46.960 --> 2:21:48.960]  Or a dystopic science fiction movie
[2:21:48.960 --> 2:21:50.960]  Where if you've had a cold
[2:21:50.960 --> 2:21:52.960]  You can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away
[2:21:52.960 --> 2:21:54.960]  You can be forcibly inoculated
[2:21:54.960 --> 2:21:57.960]  With drugs that masquerade as vaccines
[2:21:57.960 --> 2:21:59.960]  That actually change your very DNA
[2:21:59.960 --> 2:22:01.960]  That's where you are in the year 2020
[2:22:01.960 --> 2:22:03.960]  Global government of the United Nations
[2:22:03.960 --> 2:22:05.960]  All these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it
[2:22:05.960 --> 2:22:07.960]  They even admit that they're doing it
[2:22:07.960 --> 2:22:10.960]  For power and control
[2:22:10.960 --> 2:22:13.960]  And that they're not even worried about COVID-19
[2:22:13.960 --> 2:22:15.960]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said
[2:22:15.960 --> 2:22:17.960]  Think about how it's saying that it's oh
[2:22:17.960 --> 2:22:19.960]  Big tech's got to track you, they've got to trace you
[2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:21.960]  They've got to control you
[2:22:21.960 --> 2:22:23.960]  You've got to have absolutely your house, why
[2:22:23.960 --> 2:22:25.960]  You've got to have secret police come disappear you
[2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:27.960]  Because, my God, this thing has
[2:22:27.960 --> 2:22:29.960]  One tenth of one percent chance of killing you
[2:22:29.960 --> 2:22:31.960]  If you're debilitated and have cancer
[2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:33.960]  Or heart attack
[2:22:33.960 --> 2:22:35.960]  This is their takeover
[2:22:35.960 --> 2:22:37.960]  Imagine on America's death certificate
[2:22:37.960 --> 2:22:39.960]  Killed by the fear of the common cold
[2:22:39.960 --> 2:23:02.960]  Yeah, that's fair monitoring, that's my control
[2:23:09.960 --> 2:23:11.960]  We have amazing products

[2:24:19.960 --> 2:24:21.960]  The globalists think you're lazy

[2:24:37.960 --> 2:24:55.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:24:55.960 --> 2:25:07.960]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones
[2:25:07.960 --> 2:25:09.960]  David Ike's son, great filmmaker is here with us
[2:25:09.960 --> 2:25:11.960]  It's made an amazing new film
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:13.960]  I haven't seen it yet, but I've seen the trailer
[2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:15.960]  It looks amazing, I've seen his last film
[2:25:15.960 --> 2:25:17.960]  It's incredible
[2:25:17.960 --> 2:25:19.960]  You can be posting it at band.video
[2:25:19.960 --> 2:25:21.960]  It's already been posted on the website
[2:25:21.960 --> 2:25:23.960]  Iconic.com
[2:25:23.960 --> 2:25:25.960]  Just during the break, I went and got a cup of coffee
[2:25:25.960 --> 2:25:27.960]  And somebody switched it from Fox to CNN
[2:25:27.960 --> 2:25:29.960]  In the coffee room
[2:25:29.960 --> 2:25:31.960]  And they've got, I guess it's Sanjay Gupta's son
[2:25:31.960 --> 2:25:33.960]  I think, I heard him say that, but I was half way
[2:25:33.960 --> 2:25:35.960]  And I went, huh?
[2:25:35.960 --> 2:25:37.960]  And then he's like, speaking of people's sons
[2:25:37.960 --> 2:25:39.960]  He's like, it may not protect you from transmission
[2:25:39.960 --> 2:25:41.960]  So you've always got to wear your mask
[2:25:41.960 --> 2:25:43.960]  And it doesn't really protect you from COVID either
[2:25:43.960 --> 2:25:45.960]  But it's the best thing to do
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:47.960]  Doctor, do we really, how long does it last?
[2:25:47.960 --> 2:25:49.960]  Well, we think six months immunity
[2:25:49.960 --> 2:25:51.960]  Which is what Gates said
[2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:53.960]  It's a terrific thing
[2:25:53.960 --> 2:25:55.960]  They could never make a vaccine for the common cold
[2:25:55.960 --> 2:25:57.960]  So by doing this, it's a problem they can never fix
[2:25:57.960 --> 2:25:59.960]  It just goes on and on
[2:25:59.960 --> 2:26:01.960]  And others saying the masks never come off
[2:26:01.960 --> 2:26:03.960]  All of this, but I know people
[2:26:03.960 --> 2:26:05.960]  Friends of mine
[2:26:05.960 --> 2:26:07.960]  They're like, just wear your mask a few months, it'll go away
[2:26:07.960 --> 2:26:09.960]  Here we are 10 months later
[2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:11.960]  And they had candy bowls at their office
[2:26:11.960 --> 2:26:13.960]  I visit this person sometimes, I'm in business with them
[2:26:13.960 --> 2:26:15.960]  And I go, where are the candy bowls?
[2:26:15.960 --> 2:26:17.960]  Well, people reach in the candy and they spread it
[2:26:17.960 --> 2:26:19.960]  Because, you know, infections up
[2:26:19.960 --> 2:26:21.960]  Yeah, but death's not, it's all a giant fraud
[2:26:21.960 --> 2:26:23.960]  So continue and then
[2:26:23.960 --> 2:26:25.960]  Introduce the trailer to us
[2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:27.960]  For informed consent because
[2:26:27.960 --> 2:26:29.960]  This is really all about the Geneva Convention
[2:26:29.960 --> 2:26:31.960]  And the Nuremberg Code, isn't it?
[2:26:31.960 --> 2:26:33.960]  It is, yeah
[2:26:33.960 --> 2:26:35.960]  And the whole point of the film is to provide some
[2:26:35.960 --> 2:26:37.960]  Balance
[2:26:37.960 --> 2:26:39.960]  Because, you know, when you watch CNN, you watch Fox
[2:26:39.960 --> 2:26:41.960]  You watch the BBC over here in the UK
[2:26:41.960 --> 2:26:43.960]  As I said right at the top of the interview is
[2:26:43.960 --> 2:26:45.960]  You only hear one side, you don't hear both sides
[2:26:45.960 --> 2:26:47.960]  When, you know, I've sat opposite parents
[2:26:47.960 --> 2:26:49.960]  Making this film who have lost their children, you know
[2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:51.960]  And
[2:26:51.960 --> 2:26:53.960]  Being called an anti-vaxxer is a slur
[2:26:53.960 --> 2:26:55.960]  It's become the new conspiracy theorist
[2:26:55.960 --> 2:26:57.960]  It's a slur they use to
[2:26:57.960 --> 2:26:59.960]  To have a go at people and to make
[2:26:59.960 --> 2:27:01.960]  In belittle people that want to question vaccines
[2:27:01.960 --> 2:27:03.960]  Well, these women are self-opposite
[2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:05.960]  They're not anti-vaxxers because they did what they were told
[2:27:05.960 --> 2:27:07.960]  They did what their doctor suggested for them
[2:27:07.960 --> 2:27:09.960]  And what they thought was the best interest of their child
[2:27:09.960 --> 2:27:11.960]  And then look at what happened
[2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:13.960]  Two of them lost their sons
[2:27:13.960 --> 2:27:15.960]  And one of them's son is heavily disabled
[2:27:15.960 --> 2:27:17.960]  And when you've sat opposite
[2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:19.960]  And you've listened to their stories
[2:27:19.960 --> 2:27:21.960]  You've listened to, you know
[2:27:21.960 --> 2:27:23.960]  What happened in the lead-up to that
[2:27:23.960 --> 2:27:25.960]  When they asked, you know, is there any side effects to this?
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:27.960]  No, there's none
[2:27:27.960 --> 2:27:29.960]  And then you listen to what happened afterwards
[2:27:29.960 --> 2:27:31.960]  When they said, look, they had a vaccine
[2:27:31.960 --> 2:27:33.960]  The MMR 10 days ago
[2:27:33.960 --> 2:27:35.960]  And you say 10 days is when the measles bit kicks in
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:37.960]  And is this not a bit of a coincidence
[2:27:37.960 --> 2:27:39.960]  That my son's been having this today
[2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:41.960]  No, no, no, definitely not the vaccine
[2:27:41.960 --> 2:27:43.960]  And then they're completely dismissed
[2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:45.960]  Completely dismissed and
[2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:47.960]  These stories are not told
[2:27:47.960 --> 2:27:49.960]  That's the gaslighting. Why do you think they're pushing
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:51.960]  Such an expansion of even more dangerous
[2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:53.960]  Injectibles they call vaccines
[2:27:53.960 --> 2:27:55.960]  The UN last December said
[2:27:55.960 --> 2:27:57.960]  Everybody's waking up, it's hurting people
[2:27:57.960 --> 2:27:59.960]  Doctors don't believe it, it's killing people
[2:27:59.960 --> 2:28:01.960]  We know they're making people sick
[2:28:01.960 --> 2:28:03.960]  We've got to stop the vaccines and all of a sudden
[2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:05.960]  COVID busts on the scene
[2:28:05.960 --> 2:28:07.960]  I see them as losing their fight
[2:28:07.960 --> 2:28:09.960]  So now they've launched, this is a desperate smoke screen
[2:28:09.960 --> 2:28:11.960]  To legitimize the crimes they've already committed
[2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:13.960]  I agree, totally agree Alex
[2:28:13.960 --> 2:28:15.960]  I think it's a Hail Mary
[2:28:15.960 --> 2:28:17.960]  Because I think they know
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:19.960]  That they're losing this battle
[2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:21.960]  And as I said
[2:28:21.960 --> 2:28:23.960]  I've done a couple of speeches
[2:28:23.960 --> 2:28:25.960]  Bill Gates has been running over 20 countries
[2:28:25.960 --> 2:28:27.960]  For kids dying from his vaccines
[2:28:27.960 --> 2:28:29.960]  And getting polio from it, so it's a Hail Mary
[2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:31.960]  Sorry, go ahead
[2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:33.960]  Yeah, I totally agree
[2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:35.960]  I'm sure you knew people like this as well
[2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:37.960]  At the start of this, in February time
[2:28:37.960 --> 2:28:39.960]  You'd have considered pretty rational
[2:28:39.960 --> 2:28:41.960]  Thinking people, inject the fear
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:43.960]  And the propaganda that's been put in
[2:28:43.960 --> 2:28:45.960]  By the mainstream and they've crumbled
[2:28:45.960 --> 2:28:47.960]  And I think that's a lot behind this
[2:28:47.960 --> 2:28:49.960]  If a year ago they'd come out and said
[2:28:49.960 --> 2:28:51.960]  By the way, there's a vaccine that everyone needs to have
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:28:53.960]  Most people would have said no
[2:28:53.960 --> 2:28:55.960]  But all of a sudden you chuck in all this propaganda
[2:28:55.960 --> 2:28:57.960]  All this fear, all this scare mongering
[2:28:57.960 --> 2:28:59.960]  And people have just sat back and gone
[2:28:59.960 --> 2:29:01.960]  Yeah, okay, anything to end this
[2:29:01.960 --> 2:29:03.960]  And I think that's what they do
[2:29:03.960 --> 2:29:05.960]  Exactly, they think the lockdown's in
[2:29:05.960 --> 2:29:07.960]  But now in the fine print they're going
[2:29:07.960 --> 2:29:09.960]  Sorry
[2:29:09.960 --> 2:29:11.960]  It does never end, it does never end
[2:29:11.960 --> 2:29:13.960]  I saw something online the other day that said
[2:29:13.960 --> 2:29:15.960]  Anyone that believes that the quicker you give your rights away
[2:29:15.960 --> 2:29:17.960]  The quicker you get your freedoms back
[2:29:17.960 --> 2:29:19.960]  Has never read a single history book
[2:29:19.960 --> 2:29:21.960]  And that's very true
[2:29:21.960 --> 2:29:23.960]  You look at the regimes where people have given up their rights
[2:29:23.960 --> 2:29:25.960]  Given up their guns, you know, styling in Russia
[2:29:25.960 --> 2:29:27.960]  Mao in China, look what's happened to those people
[2:29:27.960 --> 2:29:29.960]  You know, the fact that
[2:29:29.960 --> 2:29:31.960]  But Jamie, what I'm saying is
[2:29:31.960 --> 2:29:33.960]  Is that Bill Gates and Fauci and the UN said
[2:29:33.960 --> 2:29:35.960]  The mask never come off
[2:29:35.960 --> 2:29:37.960]  They say the vaccine won't protect you
[2:29:37.960 --> 2:29:39.960]  They just say it's a new regime
[2:29:39.960 --> 2:29:41.960]  It's our God and everything must be seen
[2:29:41.960 --> 2:29:43.960]  Through the template of medical health services
[2:29:43.960 --> 2:29:45.960]  Taking our rights away
[2:29:45.960 --> 2:29:47.960]  And this is just fantastical evil
[2:29:47.960 --> 2:29:49.960]  It is, it's all part of the greater good
[2:29:49.960 --> 2:29:51.960]  What they're calling the greater good
[2:29:51.960 --> 2:29:53.960]  And I think what they've done very cleverly with the masks
[2:29:53.960 --> 2:29:55.960]  Is because, you know, you research
[2:29:55.960 --> 2:29:57.960]  These masks for 30 seconds
[2:29:57.960 --> 2:29:59.960]  You realize that they're absolutely useless
[2:29:59.960 --> 2:30:01.960]  That are blocking any kind of particles
[2:30:01.960 --> 2:30:03.960]  That would contain a virus
[2:30:03.960 --> 2:30:05.960]  But what they've done is they've not made it about you
[2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:07.960]  They've made it about other people
[2:30:07.960 --> 2:30:09.960]  Wear a mask to protect other people
[2:30:09.960 --> 2:30:11.960]  Wear a mask to protect your grandma
[2:30:11.960 --> 2:30:13.960]  Wear a mask to protect your friends
[2:30:13.960 --> 2:30:15.960]  You're a hero, do it
[2:30:15.960 --> 2:30:17.960]  When you're really supporting the lockdown that scarves millions
[2:30:17.960 --> 2:30:19.960]  You're now a Nazi killer
[2:30:19.960 --> 2:30:21.960]  Like a Nazi armband, but you feel like a hero
[2:30:21.960 --> 2:30:23.960]  Exactly, they've done it very cleverly
[2:30:23.960 --> 2:30:25.960]  Because it's appealed to that psychology
[2:30:25.960 --> 2:30:27.960]  And people that you want to do right by other people
[2:30:27.960 --> 2:30:29.960]  You don't want to be considered selfish
[2:30:29.960 --> 2:30:31.960]  So there's so many people that I know
[2:30:31.960 --> 2:30:33.960]  Obviously because of the friendship group
[2:30:33.960 --> 2:30:35.960]  That I have is they don't, you know
[2:30:35.960 --> 2:30:37.960]  Follow any of this, they won't wear masks
[2:30:37.960 --> 2:30:39.960]  But a lot of people that I know that do
[2:30:39.960 --> 2:30:41.960]  Don't do it because they want to
[2:30:41.960 --> 2:30:43.960]  They do it because they want an easy life
[2:30:43.960 --> 2:30:45.960]  They don't want to be confronted in the shot
[2:30:45.960 --> 2:30:47.960]  They don't want to have an argument with somebody
[2:30:47.960 --> 2:30:49.960]  And I think that's probably why the majority of people wear them
[2:30:49.960 --> 2:30:51.960]  It's not because they want to
[2:30:51.960 --> 2:30:53.960]  Or because they feel that they're actually protecting themselves
[2:30:53.960 --> 2:30:55.960]  Or protecting anyone else
[2:30:55.960 --> 2:30:57.960]  I agree, so how do we counter with films like yours
[2:30:57.960 --> 2:30:59.960]  Which will play a trailer up in a moment
[2:30:59.960 --> 2:31:01.960]  You may claim you get government to give you liability protection
[2:31:01.960 --> 2:31:03.960]  But you're going to be held accountable
[2:31:03.960 --> 2:31:05.960]  One way or the other for the vicious physical attacks
[2:31:05.960 --> 2:31:07.960]  You visit upon us
[2:31:07.960 --> 2:31:09.960]  Let's go ahead and play the three-minute trailer
[2:31:09.960 --> 2:31:11.960]  And we'll come back with Jamie Ike
[2:31:11.960 --> 2:31:13.960]  The new film, Inform Consent
[2:31:13.960 --> 2:31:15.960]  Stay with us, here is the trailer
[2:31:19.960 --> 2:31:21.960]  As millions of Americans debate
[2:31:21.960 --> 2:31:23.960]  Whether to roll up their sleeve for the COVID vaccine
[2:31:23.960 --> 2:31:25.960]  Manufacturers are trying to build trust
[2:31:25.960 --> 2:31:27.960]  Mrs. Deputy Speaker, we all know though
[2:31:27.960 --> 2:31:29.960]  That over the long term, the best solution to this crisis
[2:31:29.960 --> 2:31:31.960]  Would be a vaccine
[2:31:31.960 --> 2:31:33.960]  First, researchers need to develop
[2:31:33.960 --> 2:31:35.960]  A candidate vaccine
[2:31:35.960 --> 2:31:37.960]  This can take years
[2:31:37.960 --> 2:31:39.960]  Vaccines kick out of the immune system
[2:31:39.960 --> 2:31:41.960]  By teaching our bodies to recognize the virus
[2:31:43.960 --> 2:31:45.960]  The countermeasures injury compensation program
[2:31:45.960 --> 2:31:47.960]  Was created to cover damage caused
[2:31:47.960 --> 2:31:49.960]  By treatments for pandemics
[2:31:49.960 --> 2:31:51.960]  And security threats such as H1N1
[2:31:51.960 --> 2:31:53.960]  Well, I think that rather than having
[2:31:53.960 --> 2:31:55.960]  This extreme polarization
[2:31:55.960 --> 2:31:57.960]  We just need to be able to talk
[2:31:57.960 --> 2:31:59.960]  Here in LA, there are schools
[2:31:59.960 --> 2:32:01.960]  In which 20% of the students aren't vaccinated
[2:32:01.960 --> 2:32:03.960]  Because parents here are more scared
[2:32:03.960 --> 2:32:05.960]  Of gluten than they are of smallpox
[2:32:05.960 --> 2:32:07.960]  Tech companies are actually starting
[2:32:07.960 --> 2:32:09.960]  To fight anti-vaccination propaganda
[2:32:09.960 --> 2:32:11.960]  The greater good is a documentary
[2:32:11.960 --> 2:32:13.960]  Challenging the scientific consensus
[2:32:13.960 --> 2:32:15.960]  That vaccines are safe
[2:32:15.960 --> 2:32:17.960]  It's one of at least five films that Amazon
[2:32:17.960 --> 2:32:19.960]  Apparently pulled from its popular
[2:32:19.960 --> 2:32:21.960]  Streaming video service
[2:32:21.960 --> 2:32:23.960]  Well, Marina, can you tell us a bit about
[2:32:23.960 --> 2:32:25.960]  How we've achieved that?
[2:32:25.960 --> 2:32:27.960]  Marina, what do you think of anti-vaccines?
[2:32:27.960 --> 2:32:29.960]  Well, yes, we've changed a lot of the practices
[2:32:31.960 --> 2:32:33.960]  Contrary to popular belief
[2:32:33.960 --> 2:32:35.960]  And conventional wisdom
[2:32:35.960 --> 2:32:37.960]  Which says that vaccines are proven
[2:32:37.960 --> 2:32:39.960]  Safe and effective
[2:32:39.960 --> 2:32:41.960]  I haven't been able to find
[2:32:41.960 --> 2:32:43.960]  Where they have been proven
[2:32:43.960 --> 2:32:45.960]  Either safe or effective
[2:32:45.960 --> 2:32:47.960]  And I think that's a good thing
[2:32:47.960 --> 2:32:49.960]  That's a good thing
[2:32:49.960 --> 2:32:51.960]  That's been proven either safe or effective
[2:32:51.960 --> 2:32:53.960]  And I think that
[2:32:53.960 --> 2:32:55.960]  I think that there's a lot of research
[2:32:55.960 --> 2:32:57.960]  That needs to be done still
[2:32:57.960 --> 2:32:59.960]  These are the raw materials for a COVID-19 vaccine
[2:32:59.960 --> 2:33:01.960]  Bags full of biological cells
[2:33:01.960 --> 2:33:03.960]  Seem to have an inactivated
[2:33:03.960 --> 2:33:05.960]  Or dead virus added to them
[2:33:05.960 --> 2:33:07.960]  My doctor, who I love and admire
[2:33:07.960 --> 2:33:09.960]  Says to me, every year
[2:33:09.960 --> 2:33:11.960]  Come October, you must get the flu vaccine
[2:33:11.960 --> 2:33:13.960]  You must get the vaccine against pneumonia
[2:33:13.960 --> 2:33:15.960]  I listen to my doctor
[2:33:15.960 --> 2:33:17.960]  Who I love and admire
[2:33:17.960 --> 2:33:19.960]  Who's taken care of me for years
[2:33:19.960 --> 2:33:21.960]  Should I instead listen to you
[2:33:21.960 --> 2:33:23.960]  And not take the flu vaccine?
[2:33:23.960 --> 2:33:25.960]  I think people should hear
[2:33:25.960 --> 2:33:27.960]  Both sides of the story
[2:33:27.960 --> 2:33:29.960]  It should be behind there, both sides of the story
[2:33:29.960 --> 2:33:31.960]  And let people make their own mind up
[2:33:37.960 --> 2:33:39.960]  Bill Gates Foundation is funding factories
[2:33:39.960 --> 2:33:41.960]  With seven candidate vaccines
[2:33:41.960 --> 2:33:43.960]  President Trump says he is very confident
[2:33:43.960 --> 2:33:45.960]  There will be a coronavirus vaccine
[2:33:45.960 --> 2:33:47.960]  By the end of the year
[2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:03.960]  And of course there's all the disasters from vaccines
[2:34:03.960 --> 2:34:05.960]  And this film, as you have in the trailer
[2:34:05.960 --> 2:34:07.960]  Points out that regular vaccines
[2:34:07.960 --> 2:34:09.960]  Teach you how to defeat something that's out there
[2:34:09.960 --> 2:34:11.960]  The new mRNA is just a mutagenic
[2:34:11.960 --> 2:34:13.960]  Thing out of a science fiction movie
[2:34:13.960 --> 2:34:15.960]  Jamie Eich
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:17.960]  Iconic.com is our guest
[2:34:17.960 --> 2:34:19.960]  We'll get him to spill his guts
[2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:21.960]  And cover everything he wants to hit
[2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:23.960]  When we go to break and then we'll come back
[2:34:23.960 --> 2:34:25.960]  With the next hour
[2:34:25.960 --> 2:34:27.960]  With Dr. Nick Baggage
[2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:29.960]  On the other side before the war room with Owen Schreuer
[2:34:29.960 --> 2:34:31.960]  Want to thank you all for your support and your prayers
[2:34:31.960 --> 2:34:33.960]  As long as we stay on air, it's thanks to your support
[2:34:33.960 --> 2:34:35.960]  And as Jamie was saying earlier
[2:34:35.960 --> 2:34:37.960]  Everything we warned of and warned of again
[2:34:37.960 --> 2:34:39.960]  It's now here
[2:34:39.960 --> 2:34:43.960]  Prepare for what comes next
[2:35:09.960 --> 2:35:11.960]  This is economic domination
[2:35:11.960 --> 2:35:13.960]  This is economic war
[2:35:13.960 --> 2:35:15.960]  We are being consolidated, we are being taken over
[2:35:15.960 --> 2:35:17.960]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging
[2:35:17.960 --> 2:35:19.960]  With their blue cities and states
[2:35:19.960 --> 2:35:21.960]  They're consolidating power and control
[2:35:21.960 --> 2:35:23.960]  To bankrupt the population and bring them
[2:35:23.960 --> 2:35:25.960]  Absolutely to heal
[2:35:25.960 --> 2:35:27.960]  And then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure
[2:35:27.960 --> 2:35:29.960]  And property
[2:35:29.960 --> 2:35:31.960]  This is a monopolistic takeover
[2:35:31.960 --> 2:35:33.960]  That's what the great reset is
[2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:35.960]  Cloud swab and these other criminals admit it
[2:35:35.960 --> 2:35:37.960]  That's what social distancing is
[2:35:37.960 --> 2:35:39.960]  Several more years, no small businesses
[2:35:39.960 --> 2:35:41.960]  Will be there
[2:35:41.960 --> 2:35:43.960]  This is a master plan, say no
[2:35:43.960 --> 2:35:45.960]  Mr. Dictionary has a very simple definition
[2:35:45.960 --> 2:35:47.960]  Of terrorism
[2:35:47.960 --> 2:35:49.960]  Other dictionaries have similar ones
[2:35:49.960 --> 2:35:51.960]  Terrorism is the threat of force
[2:35:51.960 --> 2:35:53.960]  Or actually carrying out force
[2:35:53.960 --> 2:35:55.960]  For a political or financial
[2:35:55.960 --> 2:35:57.960]  Reason
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:35:59.960]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people
[2:35:59.960 --> 2:36:01.960]  Until you submit to them
[2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:03.960]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19
[2:36:03.960 --> 2:36:05.960]  Garbage is
[2:36:05.960 --> 2:36:07.960]  Like CNN, ABC News
[2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:09.960]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought
[2:36:09.960 --> 2:36:11.960]  COVID more devastating they could ever imagine
[2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:13.960]  They told us that
[2:36:13.960 --> 2:36:15.960]  Two and a half million people would be dead
[2:36:15.960 --> 2:36:17.960]  Just eight months ago, within three months
[2:36:17.960 --> 2:36:19.960]  Okay?
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:21.960]  It's a quarter million if you count
[2:36:21.960 --> 2:36:23.960]  All of the people that died of other things
[2:36:23.960 --> 2:36:25.960]  We're talking 96% at co-morbidity
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:27.960]  These are real numbers, these are real facts
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:29.960]  This is the chicken little event
[2:36:29.960 --> 2:36:31.960]  We all run our houses, never come out
[2:36:31.960 --> 2:36:33.960]  And are taught we're not essential
[2:36:33.960 --> 2:36:35.960]  The big box stores in Amazon take over the planet
[2:36:35.960 --> 2:36:37.960]  You could stand up against it
[2:36:37.960 --> 2:36:39.960]  This is slavery
[2:36:39.960 --> 2:36:41.960]  It is not something you could put up with
[2:36:41.960 --> 2:37:09.960]  The Post-Industrial World
[2:37:09.960 --> 2:37:11.960]  Well, you might want to find out
[2:37:11.960 --> 2:37:13.960]  What Agenda 2030 is
[2:37:13.960 --> 2:37:15.960]  It is the destruction of society
[2:37:15.960 --> 2:37:17.960]  As we know it, it is making the population poor
[2:37:17.960 --> 2:37:19.960]  By designs we can be controlled
[2:37:19.960 --> 2:37:21.960]  With a medical
[2:37:21.960 --> 2:37:23.960]  Technocracy over you and your family
[2:37:23.960 --> 2:37:25.960]  They're destroying civilization
[2:37:25.960 --> 2:37:27.960]  Rebuild it in their dystopic
[2:37:27.960 --> 2:37:29.960]  Image
[2:37:29.960 --> 2:37:31.960]  We are fighting this

[2:37:37.960 --> 2:37:39.960]  Research it and share it with others
[2:37:39.960 --> 2:37:41.960]  And join the fight, God bless you

[2:38:57.960 --> 2:38:59.960]  You go to your grocery store
[2:38:59.960 --> 2:39:01.960]  You go to the mall, you go to a restaurant
[2:39:01.960 --> 2:39:03.960]  You go to the Kabuki theater where the COVID is staring at
[2:39:03.960 --> 2:39:05.960]  The answer to 1984
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:07.960]  Is 1776
[2:39:07.960 --> 2:39:09.960]  You're listening to the
[2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:11.960]  Alex Jones show
[2:39:11.960 --> 2:39:13.960]  Look at this latest tweet by Mitch
[2:39:13.960 --> 2:39:15.960]  Communist China McConnell
[2:39:15.960 --> 2:39:17.960]  Just received the state-of-the-art
[2:39:17.960 --> 2:39:19.960]  COVID vaccine
[2:39:19.960 --> 2:39:21.960]  Following
[2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:23.960]  Tottenham government protocols
[2:39:23.960 --> 2:39:25.960]  That means getting rid of Trump, COG
[2:39:25.960 --> 2:39:27.960]  Vaccines are now
[2:39:27.960 --> 2:39:29.960]  How we beat the virus
[2:39:29.960 --> 2:39:31.960]  It's under immune systems
[2:39:31.960 --> 2:39:33.960]  Not vitamins and minerals, not sunlight
[2:39:33.960 --> 2:39:35.960]  But vaccines
[2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:37.960]  Now back to continue fighting
[2:39:37.960 --> 2:39:39.960]  For a rescue package
[2:39:39.960 --> 2:39:41.960]  Putting a lot more money
[2:39:41.960 --> 2:39:43.960]  For distribution
[2:39:43.960 --> 2:39:45.960]  Yes, we're going to save you with vaccines
[2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:47.960]  With masks, with clown outfits
[2:39:47.960 --> 2:39:49.960]  And you get money from government now
[2:39:49.960 --> 2:39:51.960]  Universal income, wow
[2:39:53.960 --> 2:39:55.960]  So disgusting, and the doctor wearing the whole seal
[2:39:55.960 --> 2:39:57.960]  And all them face masks
[2:39:57.960 --> 2:39:59.960]  So scary
[2:39:59.960 --> 2:40:01.960]  But when 1.2 million people died
[2:40:01.960 --> 2:40:03.960]  In 2019 from tuberculosis
[2:40:03.960 --> 2:40:05.960]  No one cared, no one checked
[2:40:05.960 --> 2:40:07.960]  No one stopped at the border
[2:40:07.960 --> 2:40:09.960]  And look, another clown outfit
[2:40:09.960 --> 2:40:11.960]  Today with confidence in science
[2:40:11.960 --> 2:40:13.960]  In the direction of the office of the attending physician
[2:40:13.960 --> 2:40:15.960]  I received the COVID-19 vaccine
[2:40:15.960 --> 2:40:17.960]  As the vaccine is being distributed
[2:40:17.960 --> 2:40:19.960]  We must all continue to mask wearing
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:21.960]  Social distancing and other science-based steps
[2:40:21.960 --> 2:40:23.960]  To save lives and crush the virus
[2:40:23.960 --> 2:40:25.960]  So they can all be heroes
[2:40:25.960 --> 2:40:27.960]  In the history books that deliver us into destruction
[2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:29.960]  And pincers on board all the little scumbags
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:35.960]  All right, Jamie Eich
[2:40:35.960 --> 2:40:37.960]  What is it like having David Eich as your dad?
[2:40:37.960 --> 2:40:39.960]  He's so vindicated now
[2:40:39.960 --> 2:40:41.960]  You're off making films, your film looks pretty
[2:40:41.960 --> 2:40:43.960]  Even, you know, to me
[2:40:43.960 --> 2:40:45.960]  Trying to show both sides, I don't know how you show both sides
[2:40:45.960 --> 2:40:47.960]  When the other side is so bad
[2:40:47.960 --> 2:40:49.960]  But I get it, it's a way to get people in that are skeptics
[2:40:49.960 --> 2:40:51.960]  What else would you like to add, my friend?
[2:40:51.960 --> 2:40:53.960]  Well, yeah, growing up with him
[2:40:53.960 --> 2:40:55.960]  As a dad, I've been incredible
[2:40:55.960 --> 2:40:57.960]  I've been brought up with
[2:40:57.960 --> 2:40:59.960]  That desire and that passion for knowledge
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:01.960]  And that passion to want to know the truth
[2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:03.960]  And that you don't just accept
[2:41:03.960 --> 2:41:05.960]  Something somebody tells you because somebody in a
[2:41:05.960 --> 2:41:07.960]  I'll say a shirt and a tie, I'm wearing a shirt and a tie
[2:41:07.960 --> 2:41:09.960]  I'm trying to play the part
[2:41:09.960 --> 2:41:11.960]  But just because somebody in a shirt and a tie tells you it
[2:41:11.960 --> 2:41:13.960]  Or someone in an authority figure, a teacher
[2:41:13.960 --> 2:41:15.960]  Or part of the government
[2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:17.960]  Or a doctor tells you that something is how it is
[2:41:17.960 --> 2:41:19.960]  Don't just believe them
[2:41:19.960 --> 2:41:21.960]  Do your own research, always go with
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:23.960]  Your gut, go with what feels right to you
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:25.960]  And without that
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:27.960]  I wouldn't have been doing what I'm doing now
[2:41:27.960 --> 2:41:29.960]  And I'm sure my brother, Gareth, feels the same
[2:41:29.960 --> 2:41:31.960]  He wouldn't be doing what he's doing now without that
[2:41:31.960 --> 2:41:33.960]  So it was an incredible journey
[2:41:33.960 --> 2:41:35.960]  And starting to make films
[2:41:35.960 --> 2:41:37.960]  And make content, he's been incredibly supportive
[2:41:37.960 --> 2:41:39.960]  Which has been fantastic
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:41.960]  Obviously because of his background
[2:41:41.960 --> 2:41:43.960]  In the media, previous to
[2:41:43.960 --> 2:41:45.960]  Starting to do what he does now
[2:41:45.960 --> 2:41:47.960]  But the knowledge and the understanding
[2:41:47.960 --> 2:41:49.960]  He's got of this industry to pass on wisdom
[2:41:49.960 --> 2:41:51.960]  And experience
[2:41:51.960 --> 2:41:53.960]  Has been absolutely incredible
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:41:55.960]  Yeah, it's been great
[2:41:55.960 --> 2:41:57.960]  Much respect to people like him and yourself
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:41:59.960]  That have been on this journey for so long
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:01.960]  And warning about these days
[2:42:01.960 --> 2:42:03.960]  That you probably hoped we'd
[2:42:03.960 --> 2:42:05.960]  Head off before it actually got here
[2:42:05.960 --> 2:42:07.960]  But I think sadly it's had to get too bad
[2:42:07.960 --> 2:42:09.960]  So bad for enough people to see it's bad
[2:42:11.960 --> 2:42:13.960]  Look, I've been ahead of your dad on a few things
[2:42:13.960 --> 2:42:15.960]  But not many, I mean you're, what'd you say, 37?
[2:42:15.960 --> 2:42:17.960]  28
[2:42:17.960 --> 2:42:19.960]  28, okay, I was
[2:42:19.960 --> 2:42:21.960]  Missed her earlier, okay
[2:42:21.960 --> 2:42:23.960]  So your dad's been on air
[2:42:23.960 --> 2:42:25.960]  Exposing the New World Order longer than you've been alive
[2:42:25.960 --> 2:42:27.960]  He's been around about 30 years before that
[2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:29.960]  Big BBC host and you know
[2:42:29.960 --> 2:42:31.960]  Famous soccer goalie before that
[2:42:31.960 --> 2:42:33.960]  And ahead of the Green Party all of it
[2:42:33.960 --> 2:42:35.960]  So you're 28
[2:42:35.960 --> 2:42:37.960]  Your dad's been around about 30 years
[2:42:37.960 --> 2:42:39.960]  I've been around about 27
[2:42:39.960 --> 2:42:41.960]  And he came out
[2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:43.960]  This year in February
[2:42:43.960 --> 2:42:45.960]  And said there is no virus
[2:42:45.960 --> 2:42:47.960]  And I said well David
[2:42:47.960 --> 2:42:49.960]  I get there exaggerating it but now it's come out
[2:42:49.960 --> 2:42:51.960]  Almost all of us fake testing
[2:42:51.960 --> 2:42:53.960]  I mean he trailblazed, it's not about kissing ass
[2:42:53.960 --> 2:42:55.960]  It's about kissing the truth
[2:42:55.960 --> 2:42:57.960]  He literally this year
[2:42:57.960 --> 2:42:59.960]  Blew me away, I respected him
[2:42:59.960 --> 2:43:01.960]  25 years ago
[2:43:01.960 --> 2:43:03.960]  I thought he was a great guy 20 years ago
[2:43:03.960 --> 2:43:05.960]  15 years ago I loved him, 10 years ago I thought
[2:43:05.960 --> 2:43:07.960]  Well he's right about 90%
[2:43:07.960 --> 2:43:09.960]  Now my jaw has dropped
[2:43:09.960 --> 2:43:11.960]  Now he got way ahead of me on this COVID thing
[2:43:11.960 --> 2:43:13.960]  How the hell
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:15.960]  Did he guess or how did he know
[2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:17.960]  11 months ago all of this
[2:43:17.960 --> 2:43:19.960]  For anybody else
[2:43:19.960 --> 2:43:21.960]  I think when you look
[2:43:21.960 --> 2:43:23.960]  At how it came about all of a sudden
[2:43:23.960 --> 2:43:25.960]  From nowhere, he's got a phrase
[2:43:25.960 --> 2:43:27.960]  That he's talked about through his books for the years
[2:43:27.960 --> 2:43:29.960]  Which is when something comes out of nowhere
[2:43:29.960 --> 2:43:31.960]  And suddenly it's everywhere, it's the agenda
[2:43:31.960 --> 2:43:33.960]  And from nowhere a few people
[2:43:33.960 --> 2:43:35.960]  Got sick in Wuhan and then next thing
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:37.960]  You know the rest all around the world
[2:43:37.960 --> 2:43:39.960]  All of a sudden all the same things are happening
[2:43:39.960 --> 2:43:41.960]  So he knows a PR rollout
[2:43:41.960 --> 2:43:43.960]  What he sees one
[2:43:43.960 --> 2:43:45.960]  Yeah it's like someone's clicked
[2:43:45.960 --> 2:43:47.960]  Like you say a PR rollout
[2:43:47.960 --> 2:43:49.960]  This is what's going on out to all the governments
[2:43:49.960 --> 2:43:51.960]  Around the world and they've all done exactly the same thing
[2:43:51.960 --> 2:43:53.960]  That's where I'd really
[2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:55.960]  Find it frustrating with people
[2:43:55.960 --> 2:43:57.960]  Still put the argument forward that this is just incompetence
[2:43:57.960 --> 2:43:59.960]  It's government incompetence
[2:43:59.960 --> 2:44:01.960]  If one country was doing that maybe that argument
[2:44:01.960 --> 2:44:03.960]  Would wash a little bit
[2:44:03.960 --> 2:44:05.960]  But every country around the world
[2:44:05.960 --> 2:44:07.960]  With the exception of Sweden although they've gone back recently
[2:44:07.960 --> 2:44:09.960]  Were doing exactly the same thing
[2:44:09.960 --> 2:44:11.960]  They're all locking their people down
[2:44:11.960 --> 2:44:13.960]  I was going to say doesn't it show it's a one world government
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:15.960]  They admit they're going to use this for
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:17.960]  The great reset world government
[2:44:17.960 --> 2:44:19.960]  Well it is exactly the World Health Organization
[2:44:19.960 --> 2:44:21.960]  Dictate policy to most countries
[2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:23.960]  So you don't need to control many people
[2:44:23.960 --> 2:44:25.960]  In order to control the policy
[2:44:25.960 --> 2:44:27.960]  And the fact that you've got people like Bill Gates
[2:44:27.960 --> 2:44:29.960]  Who have absolutely no medical experience
[2:44:29.960 --> 2:44:31.960]  They run software companies
[2:44:31.960 --> 2:44:33.960]  Getting private meetings with prime ministers
[2:44:33.960 --> 2:44:35.960]  As they had here in Britain to discuss
[2:44:35.960 --> 2:44:37.960]  The vaccine rollout strategy
[2:44:37.960 --> 2:44:39.960]  That's ridiculous
[2:44:39.960 --> 2:44:41.960]  As you know a month ago
[2:44:41.960 --> 2:44:43.960]  Your prime minister said
[2:44:43.960 --> 2:44:45.960]  Boris Johnson that we've got the G8
[2:44:45.960 --> 2:44:47.960]  This year rotating
[2:44:47.960 --> 2:44:49.960]  So we're going to basically have Bill Gates tell me what to do
[2:44:49.960 --> 2:44:51.960]  He'll be the unofficial head
[2:44:51.960 --> 2:44:53.960]  Of the G8 on the vaccine rollout
[2:44:53.960 --> 2:44:55.960]  What the hell he's not just our doctor
[2:44:55.960 --> 2:44:57.960]  He's our elected official now
[2:44:57.960 --> 2:44:59.960]  Yes and he's the guy that wants
[2:44:59.960 --> 2:45:01.960]  To control the world's population
[2:45:01.960 --> 2:45:03.960]  Through vaccines
[2:45:03.960 --> 2:45:05.960]  And also you know there's a lot of evidence to show
[2:45:05.960 --> 2:45:07.960]  That he's really close with Jeffrey Epstein
[2:45:07.960 --> 2:45:09.960]  And then you're wanting to take
[2:45:09.960 --> 2:45:11.960]  A policy from him
[2:45:11.960 --> 2:45:13.960]  We're expected to get a vaccine
[2:45:13.960 --> 2:45:15.960]  That he's the poster boy for
[2:45:15.960 --> 2:45:17.960]  And think it's in our best interests
[2:45:17.960 --> 2:45:19.960]  I mean I can't comprehend
[2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:21.960]  How anyone could look at that
[2:45:21.960 --> 2:45:23.960]  And think that's a good idea
[2:45:23.960 --> 2:45:25.960]  Well here's the thing Tammy
[2:45:25.960 --> 2:45:27.960]  We see their defense mechanism
[2:45:27.960 --> 2:45:29.960]  Epstein a bunch of his ops are busted
[2:45:29.960 --> 2:45:31.960]  Gates is in trouble and then suddenly
[2:45:31.960 --> 2:45:33.960]  A virus comes out
[2:45:33.960 --> 2:45:35.960]  And he runs the G8 countries
[2:45:35.960 --> 2:45:37.960]  Just
[2:45:37.960 --> 2:45:39.960]  I mean the Canadian Prime Minister said
[2:45:39.960 --> 2:45:41.960]  He's going to run what we do
[2:45:41.960 --> 2:45:43.960]  They're all saying Bill Gates runs us
[2:45:43.960 --> 2:45:45.960]  This is their defense is lock us down
[2:45:45.960 --> 2:45:47.960]  Bankrupt us to divert us off
[2:45:47.960 --> 2:45:49.960]  Of what they're really up to
[2:45:49.960 --> 2:45:51.960]  So really this shows their desperation
[2:45:51.960 --> 2:45:53.960]  Yeah it does show their desperation
[2:45:53.960 --> 2:45:55.960]  Because they know that there is growing numbers
[2:45:55.960 --> 2:45:57.960]  Of people now around the world
[2:45:57.960 --> 2:45:59.960]  That are seeing through this
[2:45:59.960 --> 2:46:01.960]  I think a lot of young people
[2:46:01.960 --> 2:46:03.960]  You know prior to the pandemic
[2:46:03.960 --> 2:46:05.960]  They look at the world and think
[2:46:05.960 --> 2:46:07.960]  I don't like the direction this is heading
[2:46:07.960 --> 2:46:09.960]  It's not heading in a direction that I want to live in
[2:46:09.960 --> 2:46:11.960]  And there was a big, big kind of
[2:46:11.960 --> 2:46:13.960]  Feeling of wanting a change
[2:46:13.960 --> 2:46:15.960]  And I think they've sensed that
[2:46:15.960 --> 2:46:17.960]  They've sensed that and they've started to panic
[2:46:17.960 --> 2:46:19.960]  It's towards the end of the game
[2:46:19.960 --> 2:46:21.960]  And they feel like their lead is
[2:46:21.960 --> 2:46:23.960]  You know it's diminishing
[2:46:23.960 --> 2:46:25.960]  So they've thrown that final big kitchen sink
[2:46:25.960 --> 2:46:27.960]  To try and get what they want to get over the line
[2:46:27.960 --> 2:46:29.960]  Because there's no going back
[2:46:29.960 --> 2:46:31.960]  There's no normal after this
[2:46:31.960 --> 2:46:33.960]  I said this very early on in the pandemic
[2:46:33.960 --> 2:46:35.960]  This is not a situation now
[2:46:35.960 --> 2:46:37.960]  Where you can have a score draw
[2:46:37.960 --> 2:46:39.960]  And it kind of goes back to somewhat how it was
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:41.960]  We either win this war or they win this war
[2:46:41.960 --> 2:46:43.960]  There's no middle ground anymore
[2:46:43.960 --> 2:46:45.960]  That's right, the war is now
[2:46:45.960 --> 2:46:47.960]  The war is here and listen
[2:46:47.960 --> 2:46:49.960]  They're failing on a lot of fronts
[2:46:49.960 --> 2:46:51.960]  The awakening is so gigantic
[2:46:51.960 --> 2:46:53.960]  I see the crowds, your dad
[2:46:53.960 --> 2:46:55.960]  Hundreds of thousands, we're getting those as well
[2:46:55.960 --> 2:46:57.960]  We just have to keep fighting
[2:46:57.960 --> 2:46:59.960]  I don't care if you have liability protection
[2:46:59.960 --> 2:47:01.960]  I'm going to hold you responsible
[2:47:01.960 --> 2:47:03.960]  Sign a form saying it
[2:47:03.960 --> 2:47:05.960]  They won't do it
[2:47:05.960 --> 2:47:07.960]  And the average doctor and nurse will not take it
[2:47:07.960 --> 2:47:09.960]  I've had four children
[2:47:09.960 --> 2:47:11.960]  And by the second one, when I refused vaccines
[2:47:11.960 --> 2:47:13.960]  The nurses would call me inside and they'd go
[2:47:13.960 --> 2:47:15.960]  We give shots to newborn babies
[2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:17.960]  A lot of them die
[2:47:17.960 --> 2:47:19.960]  That's why infant mortality is way up
[2:47:19.960 --> 2:47:21.960]  And now that's in the news
[2:47:21.960 --> 2:47:23.960]  So not almost none of them agree either
[2:47:23.960 --> 2:47:25.960]  This is a paper tiger
[2:47:25.960 --> 2:47:27.960]  But sadly, very few of them speak out
[2:47:27.960 --> 2:47:29.960]  What I've noticed
[2:47:29.960 --> 2:47:31.960]  And I'm sure you noticed this too
[2:47:31.960 --> 2:47:33.960]  Obviously with what you do
[2:47:33.960 --> 2:47:35.960]  Is when you start talking about certain things
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:37.960]  All of a sudden, a barrage of people
[2:47:37.960 --> 2:47:39.960]  That have been through exactly the same thing
[2:47:39.960 --> 2:47:41.960]  Contact you, as soon as we put out a trailer
[2:47:41.960 --> 2:47:43.960]  For another trailer, not the one that you showed
[2:47:43.960 --> 2:47:45.960]  Which was a story of a mother called Amanda
[2:47:45.960 --> 2:47:47.960]  And her son had the MMR
[2:47:47.960 --> 2:47:49.960]  And he died after 10 days afterwards
[2:47:49.960 --> 2:47:51.960]  Once we put that trailer up
[2:47:51.960 --> 2:47:53.960]  Her telling that story, the amount of messages
[2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:55.960]  That me and my team got
[2:47:55.960 --> 2:47:57.960]  Of people telling exactly the same story
[2:47:57.960 --> 2:47:59.960]  And that's why
[2:47:59.960 --> 2:48:01.960]  They don't want us talking about this subject
[2:48:01.960 --> 2:48:03.960]  I mean, yeah, that image you've got up now
[2:48:03.960 --> 2:48:05.960]  That absolutely made my blood boil
[2:48:05.960 --> 2:48:07.960]  Earlier on when I saw that
[2:48:07.960 --> 2:48:09.960]  Because it's the kids they want
[2:48:09.960 --> 2:48:11.960]  It's the kids they want because they're the adults of tomorrow
[2:48:11.960 --> 2:48:13.960]  And when you see
[2:48:13.960 --> 2:48:15.960]  What the destruction and the devastation
[2:48:15.960 --> 2:48:17.960]  That vaccines have caused
[2:48:17.960 --> 2:48:19.960]  And they're the ones that took 15 years to develop
[2:48:19.960 --> 2:48:21.960]  Have caused
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:23.960]  Then you have one that's taken six months
[2:48:23.960 --> 2:48:25.960]  For a virus that they claim they don't understand
[2:48:25.960 --> 2:48:27.960]  There's flimsy evidence whether it actually exists
[2:48:27.960 --> 2:48:29.960]  Now they're saying it's mutating
[2:48:29.960 --> 2:48:31.960]  They're saying that the immunization
[2:48:31.960 --> 2:48:33.960]  Might only last six months, but actually
[2:48:33.960 --> 2:48:35.960]  You still have to wear a mask, you still have to social distance
[2:48:35.960 --> 2:48:37.960]  It's just none of it makes any sense
[2:48:37.960 --> 2:48:39.960]  Well, that's right, they are preparing you
[2:48:39.960 --> 2:48:41.960]  For a crisis so big
[2:48:41.960 --> 2:48:43.960]  It implodes the world economy
[2:48:43.960 --> 2:48:45.960]  And then so many doctors and lawyers
[2:48:45.960 --> 2:48:47.960]  And nurses are involved
[2:48:47.960 --> 2:48:49.960]  They all then join the cover up
[2:48:49.960 --> 2:48:51.960]  That's what you call a giant corruption
[2:48:51.960 --> 2:48:53.960]  Tar baby event
[2:48:53.960 --> 2:48:55.960]  Jamie Ike, join us again
[2:48:55.960 --> 2:48:57.960]  I'm impressed with your work
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:48:59.960]  Please come on with Owen Schreuer
[2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:01.960]  And the other shows we have here at the InfoWars Network
[2:49:01.960 --> 2:49:03.960]  Iconic.com
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:05.960]  I-C-K-O-N-I-C
[2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:07.960]  And we also have a great David Ike section
[2:49:07.960 --> 2:49:09.960]  At band.video
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:11.960]  We salute you and we salute the rest of your family
[2:49:11.960 --> 2:49:13.960]  And we thank you so much
[2:49:13.960 --> 2:49:15.960]  Thanks for having me on, take care of yourself, have a great holiday
[2:49:15.960 --> 2:49:17.960]  Thank you brother, we are the human resistance
[2:49:17.960 --> 2:49:19.960]  I got a lot of callers
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:21.960]  We had to get rid of them
[2:49:21.960 --> 2:49:23.960]  I kept Ron and Kathy on hold to get to you
[2:49:23.960 --> 2:49:25.960]  I had a daughter Nick baggage taken over
[2:49:25.960 --> 2:49:27.960]  History is happening now
[2:49:27.960 --> 2:49:29.960]  This is the InfoWars
[2:49:29.960 --> 2:49:57.960]  This is the InfoWars Network
[2:49:57.960 --> 2:49:59.960]  This is the InfoWars Network
[2:50:27.960 --> 2:50:37.960]  The globalists and their minions want to play God
[2:50:37.960 --> 2:50:41.960]  Chuck E. Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama
[2:50:41.960 --> 2:50:43.960]  You look at these sacks of garbage and you think
[2:50:43.960 --> 2:50:45.960]  Why do they hate humanity so much?
[2:50:45.960 --> 2:50:47.960]  Why do they love death?
[2:50:47.960 --> 2:50:49.960]  Because they hate themselves
[2:50:49.960 --> 2:50:51.960]  They project their own
[2:50:51.960 --> 2:50:53.960]  Discussed with their soul
[2:50:53.960 --> 2:50:55.960]  On to us
[2:50:55.960 --> 2:50:57.960]  And once you understand that basic psychological point
[2:50:57.960 --> 2:50:59.960]  Every other answer is completely clear
[2:50:59.960 --> 2:51:01.960]  That's why they hate InfoWars
[2:51:01.960 --> 2:51:03.960]  We believe in humanity
[2:51:03.960 --> 2:51:05.960]  We think you're beautiful
[2:51:05.960 --> 2:51:07.960]  We think you're amazing
[2:51:07.960 --> 2:51:09.960]  InfoWars knows you're fallen
[2:51:09.960 --> 2:51:11.960]  But that you have God's potential that God gave you
[2:51:11.960 --> 2:51:13.960]  Ladies and gentlemen
[2:51:13.960 --> 2:51:15.960]  The great epic battle is now here
[2:51:15.960 --> 2:51:17.960]  It's now upon us
[2:51:17.960 --> 2:51:19.960]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about InfoWars now more than ever
[2:51:19.960 --> 2:51:21.960]  When the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth
[2:51:21.960 --> 2:51:23.960]  We know you're going to override these globalists
[2:51:23.960 --> 2:51:25.960]  We know you're going to defeat them
[2:51:25.960 --> 2:51:27.960]  I just want to salute you all for your action
[2:51:27.960 --> 2:51:29.960]  Everything you've already done
[2:51:29.960 --> 2:51:31.960]  Because God's on our side
[2:51:31.960 --> 2:51:53.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:51:53.960 --> 2:52:01.960]  All the blunders always blaze, blaze by intuition
[2:52:01.960 --> 2:52:05.960]  The digit counts as far as that depth of life is
[2:52:05.960 --> 2:52:13.960]  Show a blaze and leave it all
[2:52:13.960 --> 2:52:15.960]  I'll take your phone calls
[2:52:15.960 --> 2:52:17.960]  Head of Dr. Nick Megan Stangenober
[2:52:17.960 --> 2:52:19.960]  Then I'll destroy her in the war room
[2:52:19.960 --> 2:52:21.960]  I'll definitely do some live shows this weekend
[2:52:21.960 --> 2:52:23.960]  And then I've told my family I'm doing it
[2:52:23.960 --> 2:52:25.960]  Because I need to do it
[2:52:25.960 --> 2:52:27.960]  I need to go detox, I need to take natural defense
[2:52:27.960 --> 2:52:29.960]  I need to take my X2, I need to hike 10 miles every other day
[2:52:29.960 --> 2:52:31.960]  I need to get right with Jesus
[2:52:31.960 --> 2:52:33.960]  And go out to the wilderness for about a week
[2:52:33.960 --> 2:52:35.960]  So I'm going to try that over Christmas
[2:52:35.960 --> 2:52:37.960]  We'll see if I can do it
[2:52:37.960 --> 2:52:39.960]  But it's the right time to do it
[2:52:39.960 --> 2:52:41.960]  Let's go to Ron in New York, then Kathy in Alaska
[2:52:41.960 --> 2:52:43.960]  Ron, welcome and we appreciate you holding
[2:52:43.960 --> 2:52:47.960]  Hey Alex, thanks for holding on to my call
[2:52:47.960 --> 2:52:49.960]  Because what I have to ask you after my comment is
[2:52:49.960 --> 2:52:53.960]  I lack the words to describe how important it is
[2:52:53.960 --> 2:52:55.960]  I wrote down what I had to say
[2:52:55.960 --> 2:52:57.960]  So I'll turn it and burn it and not waste your time here
[2:52:57.960 --> 2:52:59.960]  No, take your time, go ahead and say it
[2:52:59.960 --> 2:53:01.960]  Sweet
[2:53:01.960 --> 2:53:03.960]  Been listening for a few years
[2:53:03.960 --> 2:53:05.960]  Just to keep my eyes and ears open
[2:53:05.960 --> 2:53:07.960]  And I never really had a reason to call in before
[2:53:07.960 --> 2:53:11.960]  But my entire world
[2:53:11.960 --> 2:53:13.960]  Just changed with something I just found out about
[2:53:13.960 --> 2:53:17.960]  And I want to share that and bought the question off you
[2:53:17.960 --> 2:53:19.960]  At 34
[2:53:19.960 --> 2:53:21.960]  I just found out I'm going to be a father
[2:53:21.960 --> 2:53:23.960]  For the first time
[2:53:23.960 --> 2:53:25.960]  And I feel like
[2:53:25.960 --> 2:53:27.960]  Parts of my DNA are being unlocked
[2:53:27.960 --> 2:53:29.960]  Things that I never understood before
[2:53:29.960 --> 2:53:31.960]  And people talk about being a dad
[2:53:31.960 --> 2:53:33.960]  Boy, I'm getting it
[2:53:33.960 --> 2:53:35.960]  I'm excited
[2:53:35.960 --> 2:53:37.960]  But I'm also kind of sick to my stomach
[2:53:37.960 --> 2:53:39.960]  Because I realized
[2:53:39.960 --> 2:53:41.960]  They're not going to have the same childhood that I had
[2:53:41.960 --> 2:53:43.960]  I was part of that
[2:53:43.960 --> 2:53:45.960]  Final generation of kids growing up
[2:53:45.960 --> 2:53:47.960]  You know, before 9-11
[2:53:47.960 --> 2:53:49.960]  And social media and all that kind of stuff
[2:53:49.960 --> 2:53:51.960]  Cell phones, it was healthy and organic
[2:53:51.960 --> 2:53:53.960]  And
[2:53:53.960 --> 2:53:55.960]  Now I'm thinking my kids are not going to grow up in that world
[2:53:55.960 --> 2:53:57.960]  So now you're going to have to really commit to the fight
[2:53:57.960 --> 2:53:59.960]  Absolutely
[2:53:59.960 --> 2:54:01.960]  They're inducting your children into a hardcore
[2:54:01.960 --> 2:54:03.960]  Scientific dictatorship
[2:54:03.960 --> 2:54:05.960]  Where they're dirty, they're bad, they wear a mask
[2:54:05.960 --> 2:54:07.960]  They get scanned
[2:54:07.960 --> 2:54:09.960]  All by the criminal pedophile establishment
[2:54:09.960 --> 2:54:11.960]  That's exactly what I was going to say
[2:54:11.960 --> 2:54:13.960]  They're not going to know a world without masks
[2:54:13.960 --> 2:54:15.960]  But that's okay
[2:54:15.960 --> 2:54:17.960]  We were asleep before as it crept up on us
[2:54:17.960 --> 2:54:19.960]  Now you educate them
[2:54:19.960 --> 2:54:21.960]  And explain how they're an enemy
[2:54:21.960 --> 2:54:23.960]  And children are already pre-programmed
[2:54:23.960 --> 2:54:25.960]  Listen to their fathers and mothers
[2:54:25.960 --> 2:54:27.960]  You explain how they're there to set them up
[2:54:27.960 --> 2:54:29.960]  And how they're controlled
[2:54:29.960 --> 2:54:31.960]  Your children will become five times more powerful
[2:54:31.960 --> 2:54:33.960]  Under the attack
[2:54:33.960 --> 2:54:35.960]  It's if they don't know about the attack, they'll be weak
[2:54:35.960 --> 2:54:37.960]  I'm a huge history guy
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:39.960]  I know you mentioned that a couple of times
[2:54:39.960 --> 2:54:41.960]  You just said it, my parents got me into history
[2:54:41.960 --> 2:54:43.960]  They sit there and tell me how stuff worked
[2:54:43.960 --> 2:54:45.960]  They got me into history and then I recognized it all
[2:54:45.960 --> 2:54:47.960]  That's the trick
[2:54:47.960 --> 2:54:49.960]  History, if your parents tell you all this, you don't listen
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:51.960]  You give them history or
[2:54:51.960 --> 2:54:53.960]  Even fairy tales or art types
[2:54:53.960 --> 2:54:55.960]  Like you're a little girl, you're in the woods
[2:54:55.960 --> 2:54:57.960]  A man comes up back to nice
[2:54:57.960 --> 2:54:59.960]  But he's really a wolf
[2:54:59.960 --> 2:55:01.960]  You understand?
[2:55:01.960 --> 2:55:03.960]  You've got to scare the living hell out of your kids
[2:55:03.960 --> 2:55:05.960]  I'm a huge, greatest generation guy
[2:55:05.960 --> 2:55:07.960]  For example, I mean first and foremost
[2:55:07.960 --> 2:55:09.960]  And I'm seeing, you know, they're being taught
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:11.960]  The founders are racist
[2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:13.960]  They're being taught the greatest generation
[2:55:13.960 --> 2:55:15.960]  They didn't volunteer and line up around the block
[2:55:15.960 --> 2:55:17.960]  After December 7th, 1941
[2:55:17.960 --> 2:55:19.960]  And so you just explained to your children
[2:55:19.960 --> 2:55:21.960]  Whether they're black or white or whatever
[2:55:21.960 --> 2:55:23.960]  This is an enemy attack, that's all you did
[2:55:23.960 --> 2:55:25.960]  It's exactly what it is
[2:55:25.960 --> 2:55:27.960]  I'll just say just for my question
[2:55:27.960 --> 2:55:29.960]  This is critical
[2:55:29.960 --> 2:55:31.960]  I really don't know what to do
[2:55:31.960 --> 2:55:33.960]  This is my first time around with this
[2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:35.960]  Just don't take the vaccines, eat organic food
[2:55:35.960 --> 2:55:37.960]  And just pray to Jesus for guidance
[2:55:37.960 --> 2:55:39.960]  I'm not allowed in there to even hear
[2:55:39.960 --> 2:55:41.960]  My child heartbeat for the ultrasound
[2:55:41.960 --> 2:55:43.960]  There's only one person allowed in there
[2:55:43.960 --> 2:55:45.960]  I'm like, how do I get her to
[2:55:45.960 --> 2:55:47.960]  You know, not take the vaccines
[2:55:47.960 --> 2:55:49.960]  You shouldn't even be doing ultrasounds until they're like 6 months old
[2:55:49.960 --> 2:55:51.960]  I get it, I don't know where you're going to the doctor
[2:55:51.960 --> 2:55:53.960]  I don't know where they're doing this
[2:55:53.960 --> 2:55:55.960]  But they shouldn't keep you out of the room
[2:55:55.960 --> 2:55:57.960]  It's all part of the cult taking dads away from their kids
[2:55:57.960 --> 2:55:59.960]  I appreciate your call
[2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:01.960]  But listen
[2:56:01.960 --> 2:56:03.960]  There's a global move against humanity
[2:56:03.960 --> 2:56:05.960]  A corporate takeover of the human body
[2:56:05.960 --> 2:56:07.960]  On the frontier
[2:56:07.960 --> 2:56:09.960]  That's the big goal with computers
[2:56:09.960 --> 2:56:11.960]  They will replace us with robots and computers
[2:56:11.960 --> 2:56:13.960]  To do it, they got to make us be screwed up
[2:56:13.960 --> 2:56:15.960]  And obsolete and on drugs and mindless
[2:56:15.960 --> 2:56:17.960]  Be aware of the attack
[2:56:17.960 --> 2:56:19.960]  Educate your children
[2:56:19.960 --> 2:56:21.960]  And tell them about God
[2:56:21.960 --> 2:56:23.960]  And then they will transcend the enemy
[2:56:23.960 --> 2:56:25.960]  Alright, Kathy, final call
[2:56:25.960 --> 2:56:27.960]  Got a few other news items to hit
[2:56:27.960 --> 2:56:29.960]  And then, Dr. Nick Baggich
[2:56:29.960 --> 2:56:31.960]  Or the trailblazers of our fight
[2:56:31.960 --> 2:56:33.960]  Takes over the other side
[2:56:33.960 --> 2:56:35.960]  Remember
[2:56:35.960 --> 2:56:37.960]  Spreading the word is key
[2:56:37.960 --> 2:57:03.960]  And info wars is the tip of the spear
[2:57:03.960 --> 2:57:11.960]  I'm 64 years old going on 20
[2:57:11.960 --> 2:57:13.960]  Thanks to this info war store product
[2:57:13.960 --> 2:57:15.960]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night
[2:57:15.960 --> 2:57:17.960]  So I'm doing what I can, brother
[2:57:17.960 --> 2:57:19.960]  So my contention is
[2:57:19.960 --> 2:57:21.960]  Why don't we start this new year off right
[2:57:21.960 --> 2:57:23.960]  With everybody getting a couple bottles
[2:57:23.960 --> 2:57:25.960]  Of living defense
[2:57:25.960 --> 2:57:27.960]  Now, you got to follow that up
[2:57:27.960 --> 2:57:29.960]  With the Micro Z Act
[2:57:29.960 --> 2:57:31.960]  I learned that
[2:57:31.960 --> 2:57:33.960]  It's like God working is so amazing
[2:57:33.960 --> 2:57:35.960]  We didn't know, we didn't screen your call
[2:57:35.960 --> 2:57:37.960]  We had no idea, and I go to you
[2:57:37.960 --> 2:57:39.960]  A year later and you're here telling people
[2:57:39.960 --> 2:58:03.960]  About living defense
[2:58:03.960 --> 2:58:09.960]  It's the Great Awakening
[2:58:09.960 --> 2:58:11.960]  The only thing you need to know
[2:58:11.960 --> 2:58:13.960]  Is that this enemy attack
[2:58:13.960 --> 2:58:19.960]  Is a desperate counter offensive
[2:58:19.960 --> 2:58:21.960]  We are winning
[2:58:21.960 --> 2:58:23.960]  Humanity is awakening
[2:58:23.960 --> 2:58:27.960]  Humanity holds the keys to human destiny
[2:58:27.960 --> 2:58:29.960]  And so as long as you don't submit
[2:58:29.960 --> 2:58:31.960]  And as long as you don't hate yourself
[2:58:31.960 --> 2:58:33.960]  And as long as you know how amazing you are
[2:58:33.960 --> 2:58:36.960]  And that spark and that splinter of God's mind
[2:58:36.960 --> 2:58:38.960]  That created you
[2:58:38.960 --> 2:58:40.960]  There's nothing they can do against you
[2:58:40.960 --> 2:58:42.960]  Like Dr. Nick Begich says
[2:58:42.960 --> 2:58:44.960]  As your life is closer to death
[2:58:44.960 --> 2:58:46.960]  Every minute becomes more valuable
[2:58:46.960 --> 2:58:48.960]  Every second until you're finally gone
[2:58:48.960 --> 2:58:51.960]  At the next level and then there's eternity
[2:58:51.960 --> 2:58:53.960]  And nothing but consciousness
[2:58:53.960 --> 2:58:55.960]  So you need to transcend that fear
[2:58:55.960 --> 2:58:58.960]  He's about to take over here in just a minute or so
[2:58:58.960 --> 2:59:01.960]  Kathy and Alaska, go ahead and thanks for holding
[2:59:04.960 --> 2:59:05.960]  Hello?
[2:59:05.960 --> 2:59:06.960]  Yes, Kathy, welcome
[2:59:06.960 --> 2:59:09.960]  Oh, okay, thank you, we love you up in Alaska
[2:59:09.960 --> 2:59:12.960]  Well, hell, it's funny the last callers from Alaska
[2:59:12.960 --> 2:59:15.960]  We got one of Alaska's favorite sons here, go ahead
[2:59:15.960 --> 2:59:18.960]  Yeah, you gotta come up here sometime
[2:59:18.960 --> 2:59:20.960]  It's one of the only states I hadn't been to
[2:59:20.960 --> 2:59:22.960]  You sit right in
[2:59:22.960 --> 2:59:24.960]  I hadn't been to Rhode Island
[2:59:24.960 --> 2:59:26.960]  And I hadn't been to Alaska
[2:59:26.960 --> 2:59:28.960]  And I hadn't been to every other state
[2:59:28.960 --> 2:59:30.960]  Or at least driven through it
[2:59:30.960 --> 2:59:32.960]  Okay, what I want to talk about is
[2:59:32.960 --> 2:59:34.960]  You know, you heard the cases
[2:59:34.960 --> 2:59:37.960]  And that happened up here, the two cases up here
[2:59:37.960 --> 2:59:40.960]  And Tucker nailed it
[2:59:40.960 --> 2:59:42.960]  So they're on damage control
[2:59:42.960 --> 2:59:44.960]  So yesterday our local station
[2:59:44.960 --> 2:59:46.960]  They put these two doctors on
[2:59:46.960 --> 2:59:48.960]  And interesting enough, these two doctors
[2:59:48.960 --> 2:59:52.960]  Just came up here in March
[2:59:52.960 --> 2:59:54.960]  One was a geriatric doctor
[2:59:54.960 --> 2:59:58.960]  And the other one was an immunization doctor
[2:59:58.960 --> 3:00:02.960]  And Alex, it was horrific
[3:00:02.960 --> 3:00:06.960]  The scare, the fear, the death
[3:00:06.960 --> 3:00:09.960]  And, you know, it was just
[3:00:09.960 --> 3:00:11.960]  I couldn't believe what always happened
[3:00:11.960 --> 3:00:14.960]  By the way, they now admit it won't even protect you
[3:00:14.960 --> 3:00:17.960]  They're like, you're gonna die if you don't do it
[3:00:17.960 --> 3:00:21.960]  Exactly, that's exactly what they were saying yesterday
[3:00:21.960 --> 3:00:23.960]  I couldn't believe my ears, you were saying
[3:00:23.960 --> 3:00:25.960]  You know, you can get COVID
[3:00:25.960 --> 3:00:28.960]  And 35 days later die
[3:00:28.960 --> 3:00:30.960]  What?
[3:00:30.960 --> 3:00:32.960]  It was just unbelievable
[3:00:32.960 --> 3:00:35.960]  I'm gonna admit to say everything really fast
[3:00:35.960 --> 3:00:37.960]  The second point I want to make
[3:00:37.960 --> 3:00:39.960]  I had a problem with my tooth
[3:00:39.960 --> 3:00:41.960]  And to see an emergency dentist
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:43.960]  They wanted COVID tests
[3:00:43.960 --> 3:00:45.960]  So they wanted the rapid test
[3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:47.960]  So I go to get the rapid test
[3:00:47.960 --> 3:00:49.960]  Because I was in agony
[3:00:49.960 --> 3:00:52.960]  And she wouldn't give it to me
[3:00:52.960 --> 3:00:54.960]  Because I didn't have any symptoms
[3:00:54.960 --> 3:00:56.960]  She said
[3:00:56.960 --> 3:00:58.960]  To go on Joe Rogan's show
[3:00:58.960 --> 3:01:00.960]  I had to do at least a damn test
[3:01:00.960 --> 3:01:02.960]  That's what's crazy, if you don't have symptoms
[3:01:02.960 --> 3:01:04.960]  They won't give it to you, go ahead
[3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:06.960]  Well, yeah, this shows you how brainwashed
[3:01:06.960 --> 3:01:08.960]  She gave it away right over the phone
[3:01:08.960 --> 3:01:10.960]  She said the rapid test isn't gonna show
[3:01:10.960 --> 3:01:12.960]  It's gonna come out that you're negative
[3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:14.960]  You need to take the other test
[3:01:14.960 --> 3:01:16.960]  But that takes five days to get the results
[3:01:16.960 --> 3:01:18.960]  So what do I do?
[3:01:18.960 --> 3:01:20.960]  What they want is more money
[3:01:20.960 --> 3:01:23.960]  And they want you to be part of a statistic
[3:01:23.960 --> 3:01:25.960]  You're damn right
[3:01:25.960 --> 3:01:26.960]  That's right
[3:01:26.960 --> 3:01:28.960]  And then another point I want to make
[3:01:28.960 --> 3:01:31.960]  I lived in China for 25 years
[3:01:31.960 --> 3:01:34.960]  And I was there during the SARS epidemic
[3:01:34.960 --> 3:01:36.960]  Which it was basically
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:38.960]  The only thing I saw going on over there
[3:01:38.960 --> 3:01:40.960]  Was them arresting herbalists
[3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:43.960]  Because they were saying they were selling false hope
[3:01:43.960 --> 3:01:44.960]  Or whatever
[3:01:44.960 --> 3:01:47.960]  But you know what they told me when I was over there?
[3:01:47.960 --> 3:01:51.960]  They said that SARS was a dress rehearsal
[3:01:51.960 --> 3:01:54.960]  And that's Chinese people telling me that
[3:01:54.960 --> 3:01:57.960]  Absolutely, Bill Gates said on
[3:01:57.960 --> 3:01:59.960]  Who's show was it?
[3:01:59.960 --> 3:02:01.960]  It wasn't Kimmel
[3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:03.960]  It wasn't, who's the South African guy
[3:02:03.960 --> 3:02:05.960]  I always forget his name
[3:02:05.960 --> 3:02:07.960]  Trevor Noah
[3:02:07.960 --> 3:02:09.960]  He said this is a drill
[3:02:09.960 --> 3:02:11.960]  For the next thing that's coming
[3:02:11.960 --> 3:02:13.960]  He also said it on Colbert
[3:02:13.960 --> 3:02:15.960]  What else did they say to you in China?
[3:02:15.960 --> 3:02:17.960]  I'll tell you another thing they said
[3:02:17.960 --> 3:02:19.960]  I went back in 2018
[3:02:19.960 --> 3:02:21.960]  You know what?
[3:02:21.960 --> 3:02:23.960]  Everyone going into the airport
[3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:25.960]  Into China
[3:02:25.960 --> 3:02:27.960]  Six feet apart
[3:02:27.960 --> 3:02:29.960]  You know what that had to do with?
[3:02:29.960 --> 3:02:31.960]  Facial recognition
[3:02:31.960 --> 3:02:33.960]  That's right, China is the beta test
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:35.960]  For every damn bit of this, Kathy
[3:02:35.960 --> 3:02:37.960]  You're an amazing caller
[3:02:37.960 --> 3:02:39.960]  We're about to turn this over to Dr. Nick Baggach
[3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:41.960]  Anything else you want to add?
[3:02:41.960 --> 3:02:43.960]  Long live infall wars
[3:02:43.960 --> 3:02:45.960]  Thank you, we're trying to live
[3:02:45.960 --> 3:02:47.960]  I'm out of time
[3:02:47.960 --> 3:02:49.960]  Dr. Nick Baggach is about to take over
[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:51.960]  But I thought I'd play this short clip with Howard Stern yesterday
[3:02:51.960 --> 3:02:53.960]  Who spent a lot of time attacking me
[3:02:53.960 --> 3:02:55.960]  But the guy with the puppets
[3:02:55.960 --> 3:02:57.960]  Is actually saying true things
[3:02:57.960 --> 3:02:59.960]  Other than the fact that it doesn't just attack white people
[3:02:59.960 --> 3:03:01.960]  Actually if you look at the studies that have been put out
[3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:03.960]  The SARS type HIV thing
[3:03:03.960 --> 3:03:05.960]  Attacks black people more than white people
[3:03:05.960 --> 3:03:07.960]  So if they made the puppets accurate
[3:03:07.960 --> 3:03:09.960]  I would be warning black people
[3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:11.960]  As I've been doing not to take it
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:13.960]  Here it is
[3:03:13.960 --> 3:03:15.960]  It is I, reptilian leader Bill Gates
[3:03:15.960 --> 3:03:17.960]  I come bearing the gift
[3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:19.960]  Of vaccination
[3:03:19.960 --> 3:03:21.960]  Get that needle out of here Gates
[3:03:21.960 --> 3:03:23.960]  I will not take your vaccination
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:25.960]  And be marched into a FEMA death camp
[3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:27.960]  I promise it's safe
[3:03:27.960 --> 3:03:29.960]  Just ask Dr. Fauci
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:31.960]  Come on Alex
[3:03:31.960 --> 3:03:33.960]  It won't kill all of civilization
[3:03:33.960 --> 3:03:35.960]  Just most
[3:03:35.960 --> 3:03:37.960]  Listen Fauci, listen Gates
[3:03:37.960 --> 3:03:39.960]  I don't want your gift
[3:03:39.960 --> 3:03:41.960]  But do you know the best Christmas gift
[3:03:41.960 --> 3:03:43.960]  For the info warrior in your life
[3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:45.960]  What's that?
[3:03:45.960 --> 3:03:47.960]  It's the Liberty Fighter Patriot Path
[3:03:47.960 --> 3:03:49.960]  That's it

[3:04:19.960 --> 3:04:21.960]  They admit it like stops cancer and all these other problems

[3:04:51.960 --> 3:04:53.960]  Before Dr. Nick Beggage takes over
[3:04:53.960 --> 3:04:55.960]  Biden says going after
[3:04:55.960 --> 3:04:57.960]  Hunter is foul play
[3:04:57.960 --> 3:04:59.960]  He's the smartest man I know
[3:04:59.960 --> 3:05:01.960]  Is that why he left his laptop
[3:05:01.960 --> 3:05:03.960]  At the place in Maine
[3:05:03.960 --> 3:05:05.960]  Or Delaware, wherever the hell it is
[3:05:05.960 --> 3:05:07.960]  And said, I work for the Communist Chinese agents
[3:05:07.960 --> 3:05:09.960]  This is the media
[3:05:09.960 --> 3:05:11.960]  Hell, Vandy Fair did a whole piece
[3:05:11.960 --> 3:05:13.960]  About how he's a great artist
[3:05:13.960 --> 3:05:15.960]  So we all got to worship Hunter Biden
[3:05:15.960 --> 3:05:17.960]  Now, here it is
[3:05:17.960 --> 3:05:19.960]  We have great confidence in our son
[3:05:19.960 --> 3:05:21.960]  I am not concerned
[3:05:21.960 --> 3:05:23.960]  About any accusations
[3:05:23.960 --> 3:05:25.960]  But made against him
[3:05:25.960 --> 3:05:27.960]  It's used to get to me
[3:05:27.960 --> 3:05:29.960]  I think it's kind of foul play
[3:05:29.960 --> 3:05:31.960]  But look, it is what it is
[3:05:31.960 --> 3:05:33.960]  And he's a grown man
[3:05:33.960 --> 3:05:35.960]  He is the smartest man I know
[3:05:35.960 --> 3:05:37.960]  I mean, in front of pure intellectual capacity
[3:05:37.960 --> 3:05:39.960]  And as long as he's good
[3:05:39.960 --> 3:05:41.960]  We're good
[3:05:41.960 --> 3:05:43.960]  As a father, I understand that
[3:05:43.960 --> 3:05:45.960]  And I admire him
[3:05:45.960 --> 3:05:47.960]  Pause again
[3:05:47.960 --> 3:05:49.960]  They have all these late night comics
[3:05:49.960 --> 3:05:51.960]  Acting like their journalist
[3:05:51.960 --> 3:05:53.960]  Doing these fake, sorry
[3:05:53.960 --> 3:05:55.960]  This is Stephen Colbert, go back to him
[3:05:55.960 --> 3:05:57.960]  I understand that
[3:05:57.960 --> 3:05:59.960]  And I admire them
[3:05:59.960 --> 3:06:01.960]  And I admire that
[3:06:01.960 --> 3:06:03.960]  But I mean, in terms of
[3:06:03.960 --> 3:06:05.960]  Your job as president
[3:06:05.960 --> 3:06:07.960]  Can you reach across to the aisle
[3:06:07.960 --> 3:06:09.960]  To people who will be using this
[3:06:09.960 --> 3:06:11.960]  As an attack on you
[3:06:11.960 --> 3:06:13.960]  When it is such
[3:06:13.960 --> 3:06:15.960]  A personal attack
[3:06:15.960 --> 3:06:17.960]  Because it's about family
[3:06:17.960 --> 3:06:19.960]  But if it benefits the country, yes
[3:06:19.960 --> 3:06:21.960]  I really mean it
[3:06:21.960 --> 3:06:23.960]  By the way, globalists want you wearing masks
[3:06:23.960 --> 3:06:25.960]  Like under Islam, they want you staying away from them
[3:06:25.960 --> 3:06:27.960]  All these things I read about Bilderberg
[3:06:27.960 --> 3:06:29.960]  Stay six feet away
[3:06:29.960 --> 3:06:31.960]  It's some weird occultic six degrees of separation
[3:06:31.960 --> 3:06:33.960]  They said a hundred years ago
[3:06:33.960 --> 3:06:35.960]  He's like ten feet away
[3:06:35.960 --> 3:06:37.960]  It's all this cult crap, folks
[3:06:37.960 --> 3:06:39.960]  This is cultic, weird
[3:06:39.960 --> 3:06:41.960]  Mumbo jumbo
[3:06:41.960 --> 3:06:43.960]  And decipher it all
[3:06:43.960 --> 3:06:45.960]  Dr. Nick Baggitz takes over
[3:06:45.960 --> 3:06:47.960]  On the other side of this quick break
[3:06:47.960 --> 3:06:49.960]  Please tell your friends, your family, your neighbors
[3:06:49.960 --> 3:06:51.960]  To tune in, he's always got powerful info
[3:06:51.960 --> 3:06:53.960]  And check out his website, earthpulse.com
[3:06:53.960 --> 3:06:55.960]  earthpulse.com
[3:06:55.960 --> 3:06:57.960]  Because we think about Facebook, Twitter, YouTube
[3:06:57.960 --> 3:06:59.960]  We've been taking off all of that
[3:06:59.960 --> 3:07:01.960]  Because I was successful enough
[3:07:01.960 --> 3:07:03.960]  To get infowars.com out to so many people
[3:07:03.960 --> 3:07:05.960]  When they censored everybody
[3:07:05.960 --> 3:07:07.960]  Finally, we're still there
[3:07:07.960 --> 3:07:09.960]  We were getting more traffic than we were a few years ago
[3:07:09.960 --> 3:07:11.960]  It's crazy, thanks to you spreadin' the word, listeners
[3:07:11.960 --> 3:07:13.960]  But that's why I gotta remember
[3:07:13.960 --> 3:07:15.960]  You RLs on the side of the K-Walls
[3:07:15.960 --> 3:07:17.960]  Those are original devices
[3:07:17.960 --> 3:07:19.960]  Like people's names
[3:07:19.960 --> 3:07:21.960]  They don't go to some big mother hive thing
[3:07:21.960 --> 3:07:23.960]  They go to an individual or a group
[3:07:23.960 --> 3:07:25.960]  Surf the web
[3:07:25.960 --> 3:07:27.960]  Remember that, earthpulse.com
[3:07:27.960 --> 3:07:29.960]  earthpulse.com
[3:07:29.960 --> 3:07:31.960]  infowars.com
[3:07:31.960 --> 3:07:33.960]  newswars.com
[3:07:33.960 --> 3:07:35.960]  We'll be right back with our Nick Baggitz
[3:07:35.960 --> 3:07:37.960]  He takes over in the war room with Owen Schreuer
[3:07:37.960 --> 3:07:39.960]  Please stay with us
[3:07:39.960 --> 3:07:41.960]  You must guard your humanity
[3:07:41.960 --> 3:07:43.960]  You must guard your children's human being
[3:07:43.960 --> 3:07:45.960]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet
[3:07:45.960 --> 3:07:47.960]  The globalists have set themselves up
[3:07:47.960 --> 3:07:49.960]  As the guardians of this world
[3:07:49.960 --> 3:07:51.960]  But they are the ones that are overriding
[3:07:51.960 --> 3:07:53.960]  every genetic system
[3:07:53.960 --> 3:07:55.960]  poisoning the planet
[3:07:55.960 --> 3:07:57.960]  They are the ones that are now
[3:07:57.960 --> 3:07:59.960]  engaged in genetic takeover
[3:07:59.960 --> 3:08:01.960]  of every human on earth
[3:08:01.960 --> 3:08:03.960]  to the GMO crops
[3:08:03.960 --> 3:08:05.960]  And now they've moved on to their main target
[3:08:05.960 --> 3:08:07.960]  humanity with the mRNA vaccines
[3:08:07.960 --> 3:08:09.960]  which are not vaccines
[3:08:09.960 --> 3:08:11.960]  They are recombinant DNA
[3:08:11.960 --> 3:08:13.960]  from aborted
[3:08:13.960 --> 3:08:15.960]  cloned fetuses
[3:08:15.960 --> 3:08:17.960]  where they inserted
[3:08:17.960 --> 3:08:19.960]  into your genome to take over
[3:08:19.960 --> 3:08:21.960]  your body's systems
[3:08:21.960 --> 3:08:23.960]  They'll read the actual inserts
[3:08:23.960 --> 3:08:25.960]  for the mRNA vaccines
[3:08:25.960 --> 3:08:27.960]  and then remember you've been warned
[3:08:27.960 --> 3:08:29.960]  This is the equivalent
[3:08:29.960 --> 3:08:31.960]  of an alien takeover
[3:08:31.960 --> 3:08:33.960]  Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men
[3:08:33.960 --> 3:08:35.960]  the globalists are acting like another species
[3:08:35.960 --> 3:08:37.960]  that's overtaking us and overriding us
[3:08:37.960 --> 3:08:57.960]  It's all the same in the end
[3:09:07.960 --> 3:09:09.960]  I'm going to wake up today
[3:09:09.960 --> 3:09:11.960]  I'm going to spend my entire day
[3:09:11.960 --> 3:09:13.960]  trying to make that guy over there healthier
[3:09:13.960 --> 3:09:15.960]  happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari
[3:09:15.960 --> 3:09:17.960]  and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often
[3:09:17.960 --> 3:09:19.960]  It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door
[3:09:19.960 --> 3:09:21.960]  and said, Tate, you're such a good guy
[3:09:21.960 --> 3:09:23.960]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[3:09:23.960 --> 3:09:25.960]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that
[3:09:25.960 --> 3:09:27.960]  and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what
[3:09:27.960 --> 3:09:29.960]  I want to take control of my life
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:31.960]  I want to take control of my health
[3:09:31.960 --> 3:09:33.960]  and that's why you need to go to infowars.com
[3:09:33.960 --> 3:09:35.960]  take control of your health right now and support the resistance
[3:09:35.960 --> 3:09:37.960]  get the Kool-Aid, drink the turbo force
[3:09:37.960 --> 3:10:06.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:08.960]  and welcome back to
[3:10:08.960 --> 3:10:10.960]  infowars. You know
[3:10:10.960 --> 3:10:12.960]  I'm here in Anchorage, Alaska
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:14.960]  We heard that last caller of the day
[3:10:14.960 --> 3:10:16.960]  from Alaska
[3:10:16.960 --> 3:10:18.960]  There's a lot of infowars
[3:10:18.960 --> 3:10:20.960]  support here. I got to tell you
[3:10:20.960 --> 3:10:22.960]  everywhere I go
[3:10:22.960 --> 3:10:24.960]  I'm stopped by folks that
[3:10:24.960 --> 3:10:26.960]  watch the program and dial into the network
[3:10:26.960 --> 3:10:28.960]  and support
[3:10:28.960 --> 3:10:30.960]  everything that's happening at infowars
[3:10:30.960 --> 3:10:32.960]  and this is the Friday
[3:10:32.960 --> 3:10:34.960]  of the year
[3:10:34.960 --> 3:10:36.960]  and this is the Friday
[3:10:36.960 --> 3:10:38.960]  for me before Christmas
[3:10:38.960 --> 3:10:40.960]  so I want to wish everyone in the listening audience
[3:10:40.960 --> 3:10:42.960]  a Merry Christmas
[3:10:42.960 --> 3:10:44.960]  going into the new year
[3:10:44.960 --> 3:10:46.960]  we've got a lot of controversy
[3:10:46.960 --> 3:10:48.960]  I know this Christmas can be one of the
[3:10:48.960 --> 3:10:50.960]  roughest weeks
[3:10:50.960 --> 3:10:52.960]  of maybe the year
[3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:54.960]  and going into the new year
[3:10:54.960 --> 3:10:56.960]  but hang in there
[3:10:56.960 --> 3:10:58.960]  we're all in this
[3:10:58.960 --> 3:11:00.960]  together and no one's getting out alive
[3:11:00.960 --> 3:11:02.960]  as funny as that is
[3:11:02.960 --> 3:11:04.960]  it's true right
[3:11:04.960 --> 3:11:06.960]  no one gets out alive
[3:11:06.960 --> 3:11:08.960]  going into the broadcast
[3:11:08.960 --> 3:11:10.960]  I do
[3:11:10.960 --> 3:11:12.960]  I make the prayer
[3:11:12.960 --> 3:11:14.960]  recognize how flawed I am
[3:11:14.960 --> 3:11:16.960]  just like everyone who's listening
[3:11:16.960 --> 3:11:18.960]  and just
[3:11:18.960 --> 3:11:20.960]  hope to be used enough
[3:11:20.960 --> 3:11:22.960]  to maybe pass something on that's worth hearing
[3:11:22.960 --> 3:11:24.960]  so
[3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:26.960]  I appreciate you
[3:11:26.960 --> 3:11:28.960]  and I appreciate everyone out there listening today
[3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:30.960]  you know
[3:11:30.960 --> 3:11:32.960]  coming from a political family
[3:11:32.960 --> 3:11:34.960]  and listening to that little clip about Biden
[3:11:34.960 --> 3:11:36.960]  excusing the bad behavior
[3:11:36.960 --> 3:11:38.960]  of his non-performing son
[3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:40.960]  or maybe performing in the wrong way
[3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:44.960]  you know I have six children
[3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:46.960]  and
[3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:48.960]  I have two sons
[3:11:48.960 --> 3:11:50.960]  and my oldest son is like
[3:11:50.960 --> 3:11:52.960]  unreal man he's just doing incredible
[3:11:52.960 --> 3:11:54.960]  things in the world
[3:11:54.960 --> 3:11:56.960]  Nick 3
[3:11:56.960 --> 3:11:58.960]  very cool stuff
[3:11:58.960 --> 3:12:00.960]  and my youngest son is
[3:12:00.960 --> 3:12:02.960]  totally struggling
[3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:04.960]  I mean he's failing he probably won't make it
[3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:06.960]  another year
[3:12:06.960 --> 3:12:08.960]  actually he probably won't
[3:12:08.960 --> 3:12:10.960]  so we all
[3:12:10.960 --> 3:12:12.960]  I mean no matter where we are in the world
[3:12:12.960 --> 3:12:14.960]  we're dealing with
[3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:16.960]  big swings
[3:12:16.960 --> 3:12:18.960]  of emotion in our personal lives
[3:12:18.960 --> 3:12:20.960]  in our
[3:12:20.960 --> 3:12:22.960]  communities
[3:12:22.960 --> 3:12:24.960]  in our states and our nations in the world
[3:12:24.960 --> 3:12:26.960]  right now
[3:12:26.960 --> 3:12:28.960]  every place on the planet
[3:12:28.960 --> 3:12:30.960]  is feeling nothing but
[3:12:30.960 --> 3:12:32.960]  dis-ease
[3:12:32.960 --> 3:12:34.960]  an excusing behavior
[3:12:34.960 --> 3:12:36.960]  and saying someone's brilliant
[3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:38.960]  when they're that big of a mess
[3:12:38.960 --> 3:12:40.960]  is not only not
[3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:42.960]  the truth it's just a bold face lie
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:44.960]  and
[3:12:44.960 --> 3:12:46.960]  I want to talk about that because in political families
[3:12:46.960 --> 3:12:48.960]  this is
[3:12:48.960 --> 3:12:50.960]  my reality alright I'm 62
[3:12:50.960 --> 3:12:52.960]  I've been doing this a long time
[3:12:52.960 --> 3:12:54.960]  my father
[3:12:54.960 --> 3:12:56.960]  as many of you know was in the state senate here
[3:12:56.960 --> 3:12:58.960]  and then later in the united states congress
[3:12:58.960 --> 3:13:00.960]  my brother in the US senate
[3:13:00.960 --> 3:13:02.960]  mayor of anchorage at one time
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:04.960]  an assembly member for nine years
[3:13:04.960 --> 3:13:06.960]  my other brother in the state senate
[3:13:06.960 --> 3:13:08.960]  right now today
[3:13:08.960 --> 3:13:10.960]  my uncle from minnesota
[3:13:10.960 --> 3:13:12.960]  northern minnesota in their legislature
[3:13:12.960 --> 3:13:14.960]  for 20 years I mean
[3:13:14.960 --> 3:13:16.960]  I've seen it at the national
[3:13:16.960 --> 3:13:18.960]  state local level and internationally
[3:13:18.960 --> 3:13:20.960]  with the work that I've done around the world
[3:13:20.960 --> 3:13:22.960]  and unfortunately
[3:13:22.960 --> 3:13:24.960]  when you're in public life
[3:13:24.960 --> 3:13:26.960]  you have no private life and neither does
[3:13:26.960 --> 3:13:28.960]  anyone in your family that's just
[3:13:28.960 --> 3:13:30.960]  the reality of it
[3:13:30.960 --> 3:13:32.960]  and that is unfortunate
[3:13:32.960 --> 3:13:34.960]  but it is the truth of the matter
[3:13:34.960 --> 3:13:36.960]  and excusing it is not the answer
[3:13:36.960 --> 3:13:38.960]  but at the same time
[3:13:38.960 --> 3:13:40.960]  you know recognizing how much
[3:13:40.960 --> 3:13:42.960]  involvement
[3:13:42.960 --> 3:13:44.960]  how much commingling of activity
[3:13:44.960 --> 3:13:46.960]  did Joe
[3:13:46.960 --> 3:13:48.960]  biden
[3:13:48.960 --> 3:13:50.960]  his son is messed up as he is
[3:13:50.960 --> 3:13:52.960]  would you do business with that guy
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:54.960]  you know
[3:13:54.960 --> 3:13:56.960]  really the question asked
[3:13:56.960 --> 3:13:58.960]  but laying all that aside
[3:13:58.960 --> 3:14:00.960]  when I was coming into this today
[3:14:00.960 --> 3:14:02.960]  and thinking about what I wanted to talk about
[3:14:02.960 --> 3:14:04.960]  with my oldest son
[3:14:04.960 --> 3:14:06.960]  I had this conversation
[3:14:06.960 --> 3:14:08.960]  it's about social media
[3:14:08.960 --> 3:14:10.960]  and here's
[3:14:10.960 --> 3:14:12.960]  a thought to think about social media today
[3:14:12.960 --> 3:14:14.960]  it is there
[3:14:14.960 --> 3:14:16.960]  to
[3:14:16.960 --> 3:14:18.960]  harvest our life
[3:14:18.960 --> 3:14:20.960]  by stealing
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:22.960]  our time
[3:14:22.960 --> 3:14:24.960]  let me say that again
[3:14:24.960 --> 3:14:26.960]  social media is there
[3:14:26.960 --> 3:14:28.960]  to harvest
[3:14:28.960 --> 3:14:30.960]  to take to harvest our life
[3:14:30.960 --> 3:14:32.960]  by stealing our time
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:34.960]  and whittling us away
[3:14:34.960 --> 3:14:36.960]  one minute
[3:14:36.960 --> 3:14:38.960]  at a time
[3:14:38.960 --> 3:14:40.960]  now think about that
[3:14:40.960 --> 3:14:42.960]  what's more valuable than
[3:14:42.960 --> 3:14:44.960]  to capture every breath
[3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:46.960]  you can
[3:14:46.960 --> 3:14:48.960]  to divert you
[3:14:48.960 --> 3:14:50.960]  and divert each of us away from
[3:14:50.960 --> 3:14:52.960]  something higher, better, more important
[3:14:52.960 --> 3:14:54.960]  and a lot of the mass media
[3:14:54.960 --> 3:14:56.960]  and the social media
[3:14:56.960 --> 3:14:58.960]  is all about that
[3:14:58.960 --> 3:15:00.960]  right? I mean it's all about
[3:15:00.960 --> 3:15:02.960]  taking your time
[3:15:02.960 --> 3:15:04.960]  and holding it and grabbing it until you go
[3:15:04.960 --> 3:15:06.960]  oh wow two hours it just disappeared
[3:15:06.960 --> 3:15:08.960]  alright this is really important
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:10.960]  because
[3:15:10.960 --> 3:15:12.960]  what's the mainstream media
[3:15:12.960 --> 3:15:14.960]  and social media doing
[3:15:14.960 --> 3:15:16.960]  it's filling us with intellectual
[3:15:16.960 --> 3:15:18.960]  junk food
[3:15:18.960 --> 3:15:20.960]  think about it
[3:15:20.960 --> 3:15:22.960]  intellectual junk food
[3:15:22.960 --> 3:15:24.960]  this is the menu
[3:15:24.960 --> 3:15:26.960]  on the diet
[3:15:26.960 --> 3:15:28.960]  of most people dialed into the
[3:15:28.960 --> 3:15:30.960]  mainstream and the media
[3:15:30.960 --> 3:15:32.960]  the social media
[3:15:32.960 --> 3:15:34.960]  is to grab your time, steal the breath of life
[3:15:34.960 --> 3:15:36.960]  right out from under you
[3:15:36.960 --> 3:15:38.960]  by plugging you into a network
[3:15:38.960 --> 3:15:40.960]  that harvests everything
[3:15:40.960 --> 3:15:42.960]  about you
[3:15:42.960 --> 3:15:44.960]  and then uses it to capture
[3:15:44.960 --> 3:15:46.960]  more of your time and steal more of your breath
[3:15:46.960 --> 3:15:48.960]  and put you in the cycle
[3:15:48.960 --> 3:15:50.960]  and then what do they use to feed the cycle
[3:15:52.960 --> 3:15:54.960]  but before I answer that let me ask you this
[3:15:54.960 --> 3:15:56.960]  are you feeling full with all that
[3:15:56.960 --> 3:15:58.960]  intellectual junk food
[3:15:58.960 --> 3:16:00.960]  or feeling totally
[3:16:00.960 --> 3:16:02.960]  absolutely empty
[3:16:02.960 --> 3:16:04.960]  right
[3:16:04.960 --> 3:16:06.960]  full of fear
[3:16:06.960 --> 3:16:08.960]  empty, insecure
[3:16:08.960 --> 3:16:10.960]  dis
[3:16:10.960 --> 3:16:12.960]  diseased and diseased
[3:16:12.960 --> 3:16:14.960]  that's what you get
[3:16:14.960 --> 3:16:16.960]  when you're fed
[3:16:16.960 --> 3:16:18.960]  from that trough
[3:16:18.960 --> 3:16:20.960]  and you know and here's the thing
[3:16:20.960 --> 3:16:22.960]  about
[3:16:22.960 --> 3:16:24.960]  as I think about it
[3:16:26.960 --> 3:16:28.960]  become the master
[3:16:28.960 --> 3:16:30.960]  of your own time
[3:16:30.960 --> 3:16:32.960]  and you recapture your own life
[3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:34.960]  become the master
[3:16:34.960 --> 3:16:36.960]  of your own time
[3:16:36.960 --> 3:16:38.960]  and then begin
[3:16:38.960 --> 3:16:40.960]  to allocate it strategically
[3:16:40.960 --> 3:16:42.960]  first to yourself
[3:16:42.960 --> 3:16:44.960]  so you're a strong person
[3:16:44.960 --> 3:16:46.960]  then to your family
[3:16:46.960 --> 3:16:48.960]  because you need that
[3:16:48.960 --> 3:16:50.960]  alliance
[3:16:50.960 --> 3:16:52.960]  and then to your circle of friends
[3:16:52.960 --> 3:16:54.960]  and then to others
[3:16:54.960 --> 3:16:56.960]  that you might be able to touch
[3:16:56.960 --> 3:16:58.960]  and that's the proper order of
[3:16:58.960 --> 3:17:00.960]  moving
[3:17:00.960 --> 3:17:02.960]  what's possible
[3:17:02.960 --> 3:17:04.960]  into something real
[3:17:04.960 --> 3:17:06.960]  and take your time back
[3:17:06.960 --> 3:17:08.960]  it's the first step
[3:17:08.960 --> 3:17:10.960]  to recapturing the breath of life
[3:17:10.960 --> 3:17:12.960]  willful
[3:17:12.960 --> 3:17:14.960]  self-direction
[3:17:14.960 --> 3:17:16.960]  of what we're going to do next
[3:17:16.960 --> 3:17:18.960]  and we've got a lot to do
[3:17:18.960 --> 3:17:20.960]  every single living
[3:17:20.960 --> 3:17:22.960]  soul listen to this broadcast
[3:17:22.960 --> 3:17:24.960]  has a lot to do
[3:17:24.960 --> 3:17:26.960]  whether it's with your family
[3:17:26.960 --> 3:17:28.960]  or your friends
[3:17:28.960 --> 3:17:30.960]  or your neighborhood
[3:17:30.960 --> 3:17:32.960]  but it's time to take our
[3:17:32.960 --> 3:17:34.960]  energy back
[3:17:34.960 --> 3:17:36.960]  and quit letting
[3:17:36.960 --> 3:17:38.960]  social media the mainstream
[3:17:38.960 --> 3:17:40.960]  the distractions
[3:17:40.960 --> 3:17:42.960]  the distractions
[3:17:42.960 --> 3:17:44.960]  take our life away
[3:17:44.960 --> 3:17:46.960]  and steal our freedom
[3:17:46.960 --> 3:17:48.960]  because that's what it really is
[3:17:48.960 --> 3:17:50.960]  it's a digital gulag
[3:17:50.960 --> 3:17:52.960]  that most of us don't even know
[3:17:52.960 --> 3:17:54.960]  we're in
[3:17:54.960 --> 3:17:56.960]  and here's what happens
[3:17:56.960 --> 3:17:58.960]  with the feedback created
[3:17:58.960 --> 3:18:00.960]  by these social media
[3:18:00.960 --> 3:18:02.960]  streaming that competes
[3:18:02.960 --> 3:18:04.960]  for your attention all of it
[3:18:04.960 --> 3:18:06.960]  it's based on
[3:18:06.960 --> 3:18:08.960]  looking at what happens
[3:18:08.960 --> 3:18:10.960]  in real time using special imaging
[3:18:10.960 --> 3:18:12.960]  of the brain when you're playing games
[3:18:12.960 --> 3:18:14.960]  when you're watching things
[3:18:14.960 --> 3:18:16.960]  when you're observing things
[3:18:16.960 --> 3:18:18.960]  because then they see how they can trigger
[3:18:18.960 --> 3:18:20.960]  the same chemistry in the brain
[3:18:20.960 --> 3:18:22.960]  associated with addictive behaviors
[3:18:22.960 --> 3:18:24.960]  orgasm
[3:18:24.960 --> 3:18:26.960]  all kinds of things to grab your attention
[3:18:26.960 --> 3:18:28.960]  and hold it
[3:18:28.960 --> 3:18:30.960]  in mind of the new world order
[3:18:30.960 --> 3:18:32.960]  to steal our time
[3:18:32.960 --> 3:18:34.960]  steal our attention
[3:18:34.960 --> 3:18:36.960]  and get us addicted
[3:18:36.960 --> 3:19:00.960]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin it's all now completely official part of the UN great reset of the Davos Group and Cloud Schwab all officially written about it hundreds of books by Schwab
[3:19:00.960 --> 3:19:02.960]  and Rockefeller Foundation all the rest of them
[3:19:02.960 --> 3:19:06.960]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030 gets here and only gets worse
[3:19:06.960 --> 3:19:08.960]  like being fed into a wood chipper
[3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:10.960]  or a meat grinder until you reject it all
[3:19:12.960 --> 3:19:14.960]  and the rejection starts with
[3:19:14.960 --> 3:19:16.960]  realizing it's spiritual battle, good versus evil
[3:19:16.960 --> 3:19:18.960]  and stopping abortion
[3:19:18.960 --> 3:19:20.960]  we must start valuing human life again
[3:19:20.960 --> 3:19:22.960]  we must start saying that we
[3:19:22.960 --> 3:19:24.960]  are not expendable
[3:19:24.960 --> 3:19:26.960]  that we are not disposable
[3:19:26.960 --> 3:19:28.960]  that we are essential
[3:19:28.960 --> 3:19:30.960]  until we do that
[3:19:30.960 --> 3:19:32.960]  we must stand up and declare
[3:19:32.960 --> 3:19:34.960]  our basic God given human rights now
[3:19:36.960 --> 3:19:38.960]  I've got some really exciting
[3:19:38.960 --> 3:19:40.960]  good news
[3:19:40.960 --> 3:19:42.960]  and I've also got some bad news
[3:19:42.960 --> 3:19:44.960]  Info Wars is getting the highest traffic
[3:19:44.960 --> 3:19:46.960]  we have ever gotten
[3:19:46.960 --> 3:19:48.960]  since the election in 2016
[3:19:48.960 --> 3:19:50.960]  despite all the bans
[3:19:50.960 --> 3:19:52.960]  all of the system
[3:19:52.960 --> 3:19:54.960]  trying to censor us and suppress us
[3:19:54.960 --> 3:19:56.960]  you with your word of mouth have overwritten that
[3:19:56.960 --> 3:19:58.960]  and they are so scared of InfoWars.com
[3:19:58.960 --> 3:20:00.960]  they are so scared of you
[3:20:00.960 --> 3:20:02.960]  being able to communicate and share the truth
[3:20:02.960 --> 3:20:04.960]  but we are bringing in
[3:20:04.960 --> 3:20:06.960]  the same amount of money we brought in last December
[3:20:06.960 --> 3:20:08.960]  right now, this is our most important month
[3:20:08.960 --> 3:20:10.960]  we are able to fund ourselves in the next year
[3:20:10.960 --> 3:20:12.960]  and I understand the economy shut down
[3:20:12.960 --> 3:20:14.960]  I understand there is not as much money as they used to be
[3:20:14.960 --> 3:20:16.960]  they are trying to kill Trump's recovery
[3:20:16.960 --> 3:20:18.960]  but Info Wars really needs your support

[3:22:24.960 --> 3:22:26.960]  out there
[3:22:26.960 --> 3:22:28.960]  and I know we hit
[3:22:28.960 --> 3:22:30.960]  the end of the week
[3:22:30.960 --> 3:22:32.960]  we are headed into the
[3:22:32.960 --> 3:22:34.960]  Christmas week
[3:22:34.960 --> 3:22:36.960]  a lot of tension in the world
[3:22:36.960 --> 3:22:38.960]  all of that
[3:22:38.960 --> 3:22:40.960]  and this is
[3:22:40.960 --> 3:22:42.960]  maybe a way of seeing this
[3:22:42.960 --> 3:22:44.960]  you know this is
[3:22:44.960 --> 3:22:46.960]  the birth pains if you will
[3:22:46.960 --> 3:22:48.960]  of big changes
[3:22:48.960 --> 3:22:50.960]  and you know think about that for a moment
[3:22:50.960 --> 3:22:52.960]  as a concept, as a metaphor for the moment
[3:22:52.960 --> 3:22:54.960]  birth pains
[3:22:54.960 --> 3:22:56.960]  represent
[3:22:56.960 --> 3:22:58.960]  this incredible
[3:22:58.960 --> 3:23:00.960]  I mean ask any woman or be there
[3:23:00.960 --> 3:23:02.960]  when it is happening I have
[3:23:02.960 --> 3:23:04.960]  this is pain
[3:23:04.960 --> 3:23:06.960]  but then immediately
[3:23:06.960 --> 3:23:08.960]  after
[3:23:08.960 --> 3:23:10.960]  is life
[3:23:10.960 --> 3:23:12.960]  life in a
[3:23:12.960 --> 3:23:14.960]  very very different
[3:23:14.960 --> 3:23:16.960]  way
[3:23:16.960 --> 3:23:18.960]  and all that pain for that moment
[3:23:18.960 --> 3:23:20.960]  is somehow forgotten
[3:23:20.960 --> 3:23:22.960]  and is overwhelmed
[3:23:22.960 --> 3:23:24.960]  by life
[3:23:24.960 --> 3:23:26.960]  and love
[3:23:26.960 --> 3:23:28.960]  and in depth
[3:23:28.960 --> 3:23:30.960]  that is really
[3:23:30.960 --> 3:23:32.960]  different
[3:23:32.960 --> 3:23:34.960]  so we are in that
[3:23:34.960 --> 3:23:36.960]  right now
[3:23:36.960 --> 3:23:38.960]  as human beings
[3:23:38.960 --> 3:23:40.960]  as living
[3:23:40.960 --> 3:23:42.960]  resonating cavities
[3:23:42.960 --> 3:23:44.960]  of consciousness
[3:23:44.960 --> 3:23:46.960]  if you will
[3:23:46.960 --> 3:23:48.960]  in sort of modern syntax
[3:23:48.960 --> 3:23:50.960]  talking about the body
[3:23:50.960 --> 3:23:52.960]  you know what the heck is this body
[3:23:52.960 --> 3:23:54.960]  you know
[3:23:54.960 --> 3:23:56.960]  it is a material expression
[3:23:56.960 --> 3:23:58.960]  of an internal arrangement of energy
[3:23:58.960 --> 3:24:00.960]  let me say that a little differently
[3:24:00.960 --> 3:24:02.960]  by definition
[3:24:02.960 --> 3:24:04.960]  you know something
[3:24:04.960 --> 3:24:06.960]  something is
[3:24:06.960 --> 3:24:08.960]  if you want to look at it
[3:24:08.960 --> 3:24:10.960]  materially is created by its internal arrangement of atoms right
[3:24:10.960 --> 3:24:12.960]  they form
[3:24:12.960 --> 3:24:14.960]  compounds and chemicals
[3:24:14.960 --> 3:24:16.960]  all of a sudden you have body
[3:24:16.960 --> 3:24:18.960]  and body component
[3:24:18.960 --> 3:24:20.960]  but under that
[3:24:20.960 --> 3:24:22.960]  materially
[3:24:22.960 --> 3:24:24.960]  is where it happens
[3:24:24.960 --> 3:24:26.960]  and in quantum physics even they talk about this
[3:24:26.960 --> 3:24:28.960]  in the sense of
[3:24:28.960 --> 3:24:30.960]  the observer you and I
[3:24:30.960 --> 3:24:32.960]  looking at something
[3:24:32.960 --> 3:24:34.960]  determined whether it is a particle
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:36.960]  substance or a wave
[3:24:36.960 --> 3:24:38.960]  nothing
[3:24:38.960 --> 3:24:40.960]  or something that is nothing from this sensory
[3:24:40.960 --> 3:24:42.960]  perspective at least
[3:24:42.960 --> 3:24:44.960]  and that is all that we are talking about here
[3:24:44.960 --> 3:24:46.960]  think of this body as sort of the tuner
[3:24:46.960 --> 3:24:48.960]  tuning in things
[3:24:48.960 --> 3:24:50.960]  in some sense of material
[3:24:50.960 --> 3:24:52.960]  material nature
[3:24:52.960 --> 3:24:54.960]  what we call our bodies the flesh
[3:24:54.960 --> 3:24:56.960]  the world the earthy part of us
[3:24:56.960 --> 3:24:58.960]  that connects to
[3:24:58.960 --> 3:25:00.960]  the non-earthy
[3:25:00.960 --> 3:25:02.960]  part of us all right and the mediator
[3:25:02.960 --> 3:25:04.960]  is the mind whatever that
[3:25:04.960 --> 3:25:06.960]  really represents and it is not some
[3:25:06.960 --> 3:25:08.960]  housing and some tissue
[3:25:08.960 --> 3:25:10.960]  it is more than that and this makes
[3:25:10.960 --> 3:25:12.960]  materialists really uncomfortable
[3:25:12.960 --> 3:25:14.960]  all right because scientists
[3:25:14.960 --> 3:25:16.960]  are not supposed to be talking about this kind of thing
[3:25:16.960 --> 3:25:18.960]  and a lot of scientists
[3:25:18.960 --> 3:25:20.960]  are a lot of real
[3:25:20.960 --> 3:25:22.960]  serious people are because the science
[3:25:22.960 --> 3:25:24.960]  is showing where the power is
[3:25:24.960 --> 3:25:26.960]  and here is the truth of the matter
[3:25:26.960 --> 3:25:28.960]  is the other side
[3:25:28.960 --> 3:25:30.960]  already knows it
[3:25:30.960 --> 3:25:32.960]  okay they have been trying
[3:25:32.960 --> 3:25:34.960]  to hijack spiritual
[3:25:34.960 --> 3:25:36.960]  power physical reality
[3:25:36.960 --> 3:25:38.960]  for a long time and the
[3:25:38.960 --> 3:25:40.960]  thing is we all have this
[3:25:40.960 --> 3:25:42.960]  incredible capacity so
[3:25:42.960 --> 3:25:44.960]  you know I talked
[3:25:44.960 --> 3:25:46.960]  about this in past programs
[3:25:46.960 --> 3:25:48.960]  the disappearance of dad
[3:25:48.960 --> 3:25:50.960]  and how that happened and
[3:25:50.960 --> 3:25:52.960]  all the disturbance that happens
[3:25:52.960 --> 3:25:54.960]  when someone disappears off
[3:25:54.960 --> 3:25:56.960]  the face of the earth
[3:25:56.960 --> 3:25:58.960]  with not a trace officially
[3:25:58.960 --> 3:26:00.960]  to be found
[3:26:00.960 --> 3:26:02.960]  and you are 14 and you got a bunch of
[3:26:02.960 --> 3:26:04.960]  brothers and sisters and you
[3:26:04.960 --> 3:26:06.960]  see the world really
[3:26:06.960 --> 3:26:08.960]  differently I can tell you that was a
[3:26:08.960 --> 3:26:10.960]  major tragedy
[3:26:10.960 --> 3:26:12.960]  trauma that
[3:26:12.960 --> 3:26:14.960]  experience
[3:26:14.960 --> 3:26:16.960]  I can tell you but
[3:26:16.960 --> 3:26:18.960]  within it
[3:26:18.960 --> 3:26:20.960]  and I was angry
[3:26:20.960 --> 3:26:22.960]  I was still searching at that point
[3:26:22.960 --> 3:26:24.960]  of my life for what the face of God
[3:26:24.960 --> 3:26:26.960]  and I was angry
[3:26:26.960 --> 3:26:28.960]  at my concept of God
[3:26:28.960 --> 3:26:30.960]  when that happened
[3:26:30.960 --> 3:26:32.960]  as many of us are when adversity
[3:26:32.960 --> 3:26:34.960]  hits us right in the head
[3:26:34.960 --> 3:26:36.960]  but this is what I would say
[3:26:36.960 --> 3:26:38.960]  in the same spirit as disciplining
[3:26:38.960 --> 3:26:40.960]  a small child God sees us
[3:26:40.960 --> 3:26:42.960]  in that same way
[3:26:42.960 --> 3:26:44.960]  so we might want to curse but it may be
[3:26:44.960 --> 3:26:46.960]  the very discipline we need as tragic
[3:26:46.960 --> 3:26:48.960]  as the events of life can be
[3:26:48.960 --> 3:26:50.960]  and that was for me
[3:26:50.960 --> 3:26:52.960]  for my youngest
[3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:54.960]  brother who was 4
[3:26:54.960 --> 3:26:56.960]  to my sister a year older than the
[3:26:56.960 --> 3:26:58.960]  15 and 6 of us
[3:26:58.960 --> 3:27:00.960]  my mom 34
[3:27:00.960 --> 3:27:02.960]  thinking of the prospect of raising 6
[3:27:02.960 --> 3:27:04.960]  kids because we didn't know anything
[3:27:04.960 --> 3:27:06.960]  disappeared off the face of the earth
[3:27:06.960 --> 3:27:08.960]  trauma but in that trauma
[3:27:08.960 --> 3:27:10.960]  my own personal
[3:27:10.960 --> 3:27:12.960]  birth pain
[3:27:12.960 --> 3:27:14.960]  when I awoke a little bit more
[3:27:14.960 --> 3:27:16.960]  and began to really
[3:27:16.960 --> 3:27:18.960]  search for God
[3:27:18.960 --> 3:27:20.960]  really
[3:27:20.960 --> 3:27:22.960]  and the problem I kept running into
[3:27:22.960 --> 3:27:24.960]  was between my ears, my mind, my intellect
[3:27:24.960 --> 3:27:26.960]  and so it was a longer search
[3:27:26.960 --> 3:27:28.960]  and a more intense one than some
[3:27:28.960 --> 3:27:30.960]  but one worth making
[3:27:30.960 --> 3:27:32.960]  and that's why I say
[3:27:32.960 --> 3:27:34.960]  trust the path you're on whatever that is
[3:27:34.960 --> 3:27:36.960]  and it's part of an earlier broadcast
[3:27:36.960 --> 3:27:38.960]  and go listen to it
[3:27:38.960 --> 3:27:40.960]  but the reason I say that is
[3:27:40.960 --> 3:27:42.960]  others are going to try and judge it
[3:27:42.960 --> 3:27:44.960]  say don't do that, don't do this
[3:27:44.960 --> 3:27:46.960]  you're going to do what you're going to do
[3:27:46.960 --> 3:27:48.960]  and you're going to learn what you're going to learn
[3:27:48.960 --> 3:27:50.960]  but if you stay in the mind
[3:27:50.960 --> 3:27:52.960]  of knowing
[3:27:52.960 --> 3:27:54.960]  don't settle for less than a full truth
[3:27:54.960 --> 3:27:56.960]  when you run into a lie
[3:27:56.960 --> 3:27:58.960]  move the other way
[3:27:58.960 --> 3:28:00.960]  there is no lie within truth
[3:28:00.960 --> 3:28:02.960]  so that's one of my observations
[3:28:02.960 --> 3:28:04.960]  but you'll look in a lot of places
[3:28:04.960 --> 3:28:06.960]  perhaps
[3:28:06.960 --> 3:28:08.960]  but take your power back
[3:28:08.960 --> 3:28:10.960]  in this, don't be a slave
[3:28:10.960 --> 3:28:12.960]  to the media as I was talking
[3:28:12.960 --> 3:28:14.960]  in the last section, don't be a slave
[3:28:14.960 --> 3:28:16.960]  to anyone
[3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:18.960]  don't let them steal your time, your breath
[3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:20.960]  your will
[3:28:20.960 --> 3:28:22.960]  your awareness, your connection
[3:28:22.960 --> 3:28:24.960]  to everything else that matters
[3:28:24.960 --> 3:28:26.960]  so I get into
[3:28:26.960 --> 3:28:28.960]  this every week that I'm on
[3:28:28.960 --> 3:28:30.960]  because warriors
[3:28:30.960 --> 3:28:32.960]  have to have a lot of equipment
[3:28:32.960 --> 3:28:34.960]  you know
[3:28:34.960 --> 3:28:36.960]  and you can address the material
[3:28:36.960 --> 3:28:38.960]  and there's lots of ways to do that
[3:28:38.960 --> 3:28:40.960]  from food
[3:28:40.960 --> 3:28:42.960]  preparation to supplements
[3:28:42.960 --> 3:28:44.960]  to the air and the water
[3:28:44.960 --> 3:28:46.960]  that you breathe and drink in your house
[3:28:46.960 --> 3:28:48.960]  through the info war store
[3:28:48.960 --> 3:28:50.960]  so you can get the things that support the physical
[3:28:50.960 --> 3:28:52.960]  in lots of ways there
[3:28:52.960 --> 3:28:54.960]  and even add to the emotional
[3:28:54.960 --> 3:28:56.960]  quite frankly and then the spiritual
[3:28:56.960 --> 3:28:58.960]  that aspect
[3:28:58.960 --> 3:29:00.960]  that you can't touch and grab
[3:29:00.960 --> 3:29:02.960]  when you're going on to
[3:29:02.960 --> 3:29:04.960]  runs better with a good foundation
[3:29:04.960 --> 3:29:06.960]  a good carrier
[3:29:06.960 --> 3:29:08.960]  so I encourage you in that regard
[3:29:08.960 --> 3:29:10.960]  but the other thing I would say is
[3:29:10.960 --> 3:29:12.960]  look, start looking
[3:29:12.960 --> 3:29:14.960]  vigorously within
[3:29:14.960 --> 3:29:16.960]  and find the power within you
[3:29:16.960 --> 3:29:18.960]  that you can then begin to project
[3:29:18.960 --> 3:29:20.960]  outside of yourself
[3:29:20.960 --> 3:29:22.960]  and this is important and so this is
[3:29:22.960 --> 3:29:24.960]  dying to ourselves
[3:29:24.960 --> 3:29:26.960]  as part of the program here
[3:29:26.960 --> 3:29:28.960]  you know, how do we do that
[3:29:28.960 --> 3:29:30.960]  trauma usually does it for us
[3:29:30.960 --> 3:29:32.960]  and puts us in that birth pain of life
[3:29:32.960 --> 3:29:34.960]  that allows us to either see it
[3:29:34.960 --> 3:29:36.960]  and find
[3:29:36.960 --> 3:29:38.960]  something within it that can
[3:29:38.960 --> 3:29:40.960]  change us. My oldest son
[3:29:40.960 --> 3:29:42.960]  Nicholas, he is always blown away
[3:29:42.960 --> 3:29:44.960]  because I can be hit with a
[3:29:44.960 --> 3:29:46.960]  rock of bad news
[3:29:46.960 --> 3:29:48.960]  you know, a backpack
[3:29:48.960 --> 3:29:50.960]  full as I'm swimming
[3:29:50.960 --> 3:29:52.960]  across the lake alive you know
[3:29:52.960 --> 3:29:54.960]  and he'll swear that I'm going to drown
[3:29:54.960 --> 3:29:56.960]  and I won't, I'll take the backpack off
[3:29:56.960 --> 3:29:58.960]  and start building a platform
[3:29:58.960 --> 3:30:00.960]  stand on you know, because I always
[3:30:00.960 --> 3:30:02.960]  look for another way
[3:30:02.960 --> 3:30:04.960]  because there is one
[3:30:04.960 --> 3:30:06.960]  that frees us to
[3:30:06.960 --> 3:30:08.960]  our inner power that allows us to project
[3:30:08.960 --> 3:30:10.960]  it outward to change the way
[3:30:10.960 --> 3:30:12.960]  the game works
[3:30:12.960 --> 3:30:14.960]  because we're in it
[3:30:14.960 --> 3:30:16.960]  we're all in it
[3:30:16.960 --> 3:30:18.960]  and we can either be
[3:30:18.960 --> 3:30:20.960]  swept by it as I've mentioned before
[3:30:20.960 --> 3:30:22.960]  or we can
[3:30:22.960 --> 3:30:24.960]  see it and begin to
[3:30:24.960 --> 3:30:26.960]  take possession of it.
[3:30:26.960 --> 3:30:28.960]  This media that takes
[3:30:28.960 --> 3:30:30.960]  and stimulates
[3:30:30.960 --> 3:30:32.960]  this addictive pattern
[3:30:32.960 --> 3:30:34.960]  it's designed to do that
[3:30:34.960 --> 3:30:36.960]  ladies and gentlemen, the science
[3:30:36.960 --> 3:30:38.960]  is out there, you can read it, you can study it
[3:30:38.960 --> 3:30:40.960]  we've covered it here before
[3:30:40.960 --> 3:30:42.960]  it's in all the books that you can get
[3:30:42.960 --> 3:30:44.960]  on info wars, stories
[3:30:44.960 --> 3:30:46.960]  that talk about this technology
[3:30:46.960 --> 3:30:48.960]  but the fact is
[3:30:48.960 --> 3:30:50.960]  the power of each individual
[3:30:50.960 --> 3:30:52.960]  living soul when you fall into
[3:30:52.960 --> 3:30:54.960]  what you are and you recognize
[3:30:54.960 --> 3:30:56.960]  what we are is created
[3:30:56.960 --> 3:30:58.960]  in the image and likeness of God
[3:30:58.960 --> 3:31:00.960]  and we fall into the full meaning of that
[3:31:00.960 --> 3:31:02.960]  the profound nature of that
[3:31:02.960 --> 3:31:04.960]  we grab our power back
[3:31:04.960 --> 3:31:06.960]  and now going into the Christmas week
[3:31:06.960 --> 3:31:08.960]  this is the power
[3:31:08.960 --> 3:31:10.960]  that we need to remember
[3:31:10.960 --> 3:31:12.960]  that we need to see flow through
[3:31:12.960 --> 3:31:14.960]  us in a very different way
[3:31:14.960 --> 3:31:16.960]  that unites
[3:31:16.960 --> 3:31:18.960]  the love that we are
[3:31:18.960 --> 3:31:20.960]  and pushes out a different prayer
[3:31:20.960 --> 3:31:22.960]  for this world
[3:31:22.960 --> 3:31:24.960]  in this Christmas week
[3:31:24.960 --> 3:31:26.960]  this is Dr. Nick Vegas, we're going to be right back
[3:31:26.960 --> 3:31:28.960]  after these really, really important messages
[3:31:28.960 --> 3:31:30.960]  thanks for being here
[3:31:36.960 --> 3:31:38.960]  Fox has betrayed President Trump
[3:31:38.960 --> 3:31:40.960]  as I predicted they would
[3:31:40.960 --> 3:31:42.960]  they've always been part of the establishment
[3:31:42.960 --> 3:31:44.960]  and it's only going to get worse
[3:31:44.960 --> 3:31:46.960]  if they're able to keep Trump from
[3:31:46.960 --> 3:31:48.960]  rightfully taking office for second term
[3:31:48.960 --> 3:31:50.960]  in 2020
[3:31:50.960 --> 3:31:52.960]  the system is going to drop the hammer
[3:31:52.960 --> 3:31:54.960]  harder than ever on this republic
[3:31:54.960 --> 3:31:56.960]  they are going to explode gas prices
[3:31:56.960 --> 3:31:58.960]  they're going to shut down our cold power plants
[3:31:58.960 --> 3:32:00.960]  they're going to cut off the energy source to the US
[3:32:00.960 --> 3:32:02.960]  so it's impossible for factories to move back here
[3:32:02.960 --> 3:32:04.960]  this is economic domination
[3:32:04.960 --> 3:32:06.960]  this is economic war
[3:32:06.960 --> 3:32:08.960]  we are being consolidated, we are being taken over
[3:32:08.960 --> 3:32:10.960]  the democrats aren't mismanaging
[3:32:10.960 --> 3:32:12.960]  their blue cities and states
[3:32:12.960 --> 3:32:14.960]  they're consolidating power and control
[3:32:14.960 --> 3:32:16.960]  to bankrupt the population
[3:32:16.960 --> 3:32:18.960]  and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure
[3:32:18.960 --> 3:32:20.960]  and property
[3:32:20.960 --> 3:32:22.960]  this is a monopolistic takeover
[3:32:22.960 --> 3:32:24.960]  that's what the great reset is
[3:32:24.960 --> 3:32:26.960]  cloud swab and these other criminals admit it
[3:32:26.960 --> 3:32:28.960]  that's what social distancing is
[3:32:28.960 --> 3:32:30.960]  so your business is only at 25%
[3:32:30.960 --> 3:32:32.960]  for several more years, no small businesses
[3:32:32.960 --> 3:32:34.960]  will be there
[3:32:34.960 --> 3:32:36.960]  this is a master plan, say no
[3:32:36.960 --> 3:32:38.960]  Webster's dictionary has a very simple definition
[3:32:38.960 --> 3:32:40.960]  of terrorism
[3:32:40.960 --> 3:32:42.960]  other dictionaries have similar ones
[3:32:42.960 --> 3:32:44.960]  terrorism is the threat of force
[3:32:44.960 --> 3:32:46.960]  actually carrying out force
[3:32:46.960 --> 3:32:48.960]  for a political or financial
[3:32:48.960 --> 3:32:50.960]  reason
[3:32:50.960 --> 3:32:52.960]  it's basically scaring the hell out of people
[3:32:52.960 --> 3:32:54.960]  until you submit to them
[3:32:54.960 --> 3:32:56.960]  that's exactly what all this overblown
[3:32:56.960 --> 3:32:58.960]  COVID-19 garbage is
[3:32:58.960 --> 3:33:00.960]  do you see the headlines from CNN, have you seen those
[3:33:00.960 --> 3:33:02.960]  doctors say it's worse than they ever thought
[3:33:02.960 --> 3:33:04.960]  COVID more devastating than they ever imagined
[3:33:04.960 --> 3:33:06.960]  they told us that
[3:33:06.960 --> 3:33:08.960]  two and a half million people would be dead
[3:33:08.960 --> 3:33:10.960]  just eight months ago, within three months
[3:33:10.960 --> 3:33:12.960]  okay
[3:33:12.960 --> 3:33:14.960]  quarter million if you count all of the people
[3:33:14.960 --> 3:33:16.960]  that died of other things
[3:33:16.960 --> 3:33:18.960]  we're talking 96% at co-morbidity
[3:33:18.960 --> 3:33:20.960]  these are real numbers, these are real facts
[3:33:20.960 --> 3:33:22.960]  this is the chicken little event
[3:33:22.960 --> 3:33:24.960]  we all run our houses, never come out
[3:33:24.960 --> 3:33:26.960]  and are taught we're not essential
[3:33:26.960 --> 3:33:28.960]  all the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet
[3:33:28.960 --> 3:33:30.960]  you could stand up against it
[3:33:30.960 --> 3:33:32.960]  this is slavery
[3:33:32.960 --> 3:33:42.960]  it is not something you could put up with and survive
[3:34:02.960 --> 3:34:04.960]  you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is
[3:34:04.960 --> 3:34:06.960]  it is the destruction
[3:34:06.960 --> 3:34:08.960]  of society as we know it
[3:34:08.960 --> 3:34:10.960]  it is making the population poor
[3:34:10.960 --> 3:34:12.960]  by designs we can be controlled
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:14.960]  with a medical
[3:34:14.960 --> 3:34:16.960]  technocracy over you and your family
[3:34:16.960 --> 3:34:18.960]  they're destroying civilization
[3:34:18.960 --> 3:34:20.960]  rebuild it in their dystopic
[3:34:20.960 --> 3:34:22.960]  image
[3:34:22.960 --> 3:34:24.960]  we are fighting this
[3:34:24.960 --> 3:34:26.960]  at infowars.com and newswars.com
[3:34:26.960 --> 3:34:28.960]  we are fighting for a pro-human future
[3:34:28.960 --> 3:34:30.960]  and we need you to keep the facts
[3:34:30.960 --> 3:34:32.960]  research it and share it with others
[3:34:32.960 --> 3:34:34.960]  and join the fight, God bless you
[3:34:34.960 --> 3:34:36.960]  visit us, spread the word at infowars.com
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:38.960]  introducing
[3:34:38.960 --> 3:34:40.960]  info wars life
[3:34:40.960 --> 3:34:42.960]  pure turmeric extract
[3:34:42.960 --> 3:34:44.960]  this is taken under the tongue
[3:34:44.960 --> 3:34:46.960]  it is pure turmeric
[3:34:46.960 --> 3:34:48.960]  it goes together very well
[3:34:48.960 --> 3:34:50.960]  with our body's ultimate turmeric formula
[3:34:50.960 --> 3:34:52.960]  that is taken as a powdered capsule
[3:34:52.960 --> 3:34:54.960]  and absorbed in the stomach
[3:34:54.960 --> 3:34:56.960]  and intestines
[3:34:56.960 --> 3:34:58.960]  this is absorbed under the tongue
[3:34:58.960 --> 3:35:00.960]  and the remaining also is absorbed
[3:35:00.960 --> 3:35:02.960]  by the stomach so it is more
[3:35:02.960 --> 3:35:04.960]  of an intense delivery system
[3:35:04.960 --> 3:35:06.960]  the two formulas are different but both
[3:35:06.960 --> 3:35:08.960]  are concentrated and our first product
[3:35:08.960 --> 3:35:10.960]  got rave reviews we have been testing this out
[3:35:10.960 --> 3:35:12.960]  for several months some of our staff like it
[3:35:12.960 --> 3:35:14.960]  more than bodies some like bodies better
[3:35:14.960 --> 3:35:16.960]  for me they are both amazing
[3:35:16.960 --> 3:35:18.960]  for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more
[3:35:18.960 --> 3:35:20.960]  and they fund the info war
[3:35:20.960 --> 3:35:22.960]  so get our new liquid turmeric extract
[3:35:22.960 --> 3:35:24.960]  exclusively at infowars.com today
[3:35:24.960 --> 3:35:26.960]  an additional 25% off
[3:35:26.960 --> 3:35:28.960]  is a 360 win
[3:35:28.960 --> 3:35:30.960]  turmeric is renowned
[3:35:30.960 --> 3:35:32.960]  for what it does for all of our bodies
[3:35:32.960 --> 3:35:34.960]  for inflammation and so much more
[3:35:34.960 --> 3:35:57.960]  first today at infowarslife.com
[3:35:57.960 --> 3:35:59.960]  The Alex Jones show
[3:35:59.960 --> 3:36:01.960]  because there is a war on
[3:36:01.960 --> 3:36:03.960]  for your mind
[3:36:03.960 --> 3:36:05.960]  Mick Begich
[3:36:09.960 --> 3:36:11.960]  and welcome back
[3:36:11.960 --> 3:36:13.960]  and thanks for being here
[3:36:13.960 --> 3:36:15.960]  on this 7 day countdown
[3:36:15.960 --> 3:36:17.960]  to Christmas Day
[3:36:17.960 --> 3:36:19.960]  and so I appreciate everyone
[3:36:19.960 --> 3:36:21.960]  I won't be here obviously next Friday
[3:36:21.960 --> 3:36:23.960]  it will be Christmas and
[3:36:23.960 --> 3:36:25.960]  but I want to thank you all for the support
[3:36:25.960 --> 3:36:27.960]  you have given to info wars
[3:36:27.960 --> 3:36:29.960]  over the year and I want to thank the team
[3:36:29.960 --> 3:36:31.960]  and Alex at info wars
[3:36:31.960 --> 3:36:33.960]  for allowing me to have this
[3:36:33.960 --> 3:36:35.960]  time with you every Friday
[3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:37.960]  in the afternoon
[3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:39.960]  and I appreciate it a lot
[3:36:39.960 --> 3:36:41.960]  you know thinking about
[3:36:41.960 --> 3:36:43.960]  sort of where I want to go
[3:36:43.960 --> 3:36:45.960]  with this today on a
[3:36:45.960 --> 3:36:47.960]  another theme and it's about
[3:36:47.960 --> 3:36:49.960]  resonance and what does that mean
[3:36:49.960 --> 3:36:51.960]  and I alluded to that a little bit before
[3:36:51.960 --> 3:36:53.960]  resonance what is that
[3:36:53.960 --> 3:36:55.960]  and it's actually a mathematical formula
[3:36:55.960 --> 3:36:57.960]  if you drew it out it would be
[3:36:57.960 --> 3:36:59.960]  x plus x in brackets
[3:36:59.960 --> 3:37:01.960]  and then square
[3:37:01.960 --> 3:37:03.960]  so that's multiplied against itself
[3:37:03.960 --> 3:37:05.960]  in other words
[3:37:05.960 --> 3:37:07.960]  two or more gathered together
[3:37:07.960 --> 3:37:09.960]  is really more power than two
[3:37:09.960 --> 3:37:11.960]  and this is why
[3:37:11.960 --> 3:37:13.960]  resonance is a principle
[3:37:13.960 --> 3:37:15.960]  God got it
[3:37:15.960 --> 3:37:17.960]  he figured it out
[3:37:17.960 --> 3:37:19.960]  but in modern physics this is what it is
[3:37:19.960 --> 3:37:21.960]  so resonance
[3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:23.960]  this is what the other side knows too
[3:37:23.960 --> 3:37:25.960]  why mass media is meant to
[3:37:25.960 --> 3:37:27.960]  capture control
[3:37:27.960 --> 3:37:29.960]  and it grabs up
[3:37:29.960 --> 3:37:31.960]  the chemistry of the brain
[3:37:31.960 --> 3:37:33.960]  that part associated with addictive behavior
[3:37:33.960 --> 3:37:35.960]  orgasm
[3:37:35.960 --> 3:37:37.960]  big charges you know
[3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:39.960]  because this is what's done
[3:37:39.960 --> 3:37:41.960]  biochemically
[3:37:41.960 --> 3:37:43.960]  and it grabs you
[3:37:43.960 --> 3:37:45.960]  you know I mean it does
[3:37:45.960 --> 3:37:47.960]  and so
[3:37:47.960 --> 3:37:49.960]  the counter measure is a re-channeling
[3:37:49.960 --> 3:37:51.960]  rebalancing
[3:37:51.960 --> 3:37:53.960]  of these very vital energies
[3:37:53.960 --> 3:37:55.960]  that are important
[3:37:55.960 --> 3:37:57.960]  really by lots of things
[3:37:57.960 --> 3:37:59.960]  when it's done appropriately
[3:37:59.960 --> 3:38:01.960]  and they create
[3:38:01.960 --> 3:38:03.960]  an altered awareness
[3:38:03.960 --> 3:38:05.960]  a bit of altered awareness with that kind of chemistry
[3:38:05.960 --> 3:38:07.960]  and then they are
[3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:09.960]  putting the physical in a position
[3:38:09.960 --> 3:38:11.960]  to maybe
[3:38:11.960 --> 3:38:13.960]  be tuned into something quite different
[3:38:13.960 --> 3:38:15.960]  so fear takes away
[3:38:15.960 --> 3:38:17.960]  tunes you into the wrong direction
[3:38:17.960 --> 3:38:19.960]  love tunes you into a different direction
[3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:21.960]  what the heck does that mean
[3:38:21.960 --> 3:38:23.960]  because a lot of love is expressed
[3:38:23.960 --> 3:38:25.960]  fleshy materialistically
[3:38:25.960 --> 3:38:27.960]  I get that too
[3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:29.960]  but there is
[3:38:29.960 --> 3:38:31.960]  a higher ordered
[3:38:31.960 --> 3:38:33.960]  to the energy
[3:38:33.960 --> 3:38:35.960]  in resonance so all of us together
[3:38:35.960 --> 3:38:37.960]  listening to this program and I'm looking at a few
[3:38:37.960 --> 3:38:39.960]  notes today because
[3:38:39.960 --> 3:38:41.960]  I really don't want to miss the critical elements of this
[3:38:41.960 --> 3:38:43.960]  we are all doing that
[3:38:43.960 --> 3:38:45.960]  right now we're all in resonance
[3:38:45.960 --> 3:38:47.960]  right now because we're dialed
[3:38:47.960 --> 3:38:49.960]  into this network we're dialed
[3:38:49.960 --> 3:38:51.960]  into this program we're dialed into what
[3:38:51.960 --> 3:38:53.960]  we're thinking about
[3:38:53.960 --> 3:38:55.960]  and hearing and I hope
[3:38:55.960 --> 3:38:57.960]  thinking about not just absorbing
[3:38:57.960 --> 3:38:59.960]  but thinking about actively
[3:38:59.960 --> 3:39:01.960]  and then
[3:39:01.960 --> 3:39:03.960]  deciding things
[3:39:03.960 --> 3:39:05.960]  about how we'll engage our energy
[3:39:05.960 --> 3:39:07.960]  after the broadcast
[3:39:07.960 --> 3:39:09.960]  today and after Owen is on and after you've gotten
[3:39:09.960 --> 3:39:11.960]  the vital information that you need
[3:39:11.960 --> 3:39:13.960]  to be ready for the info wars
[3:39:13.960 --> 3:39:15.960]  right and so that's what it's about
[3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:17.960]  and relationships
[3:39:17.960 --> 3:39:19.960]  are part of this
[3:39:19.960 --> 3:39:21.960]  because we have a relationship with each other
[3:39:21.960 --> 3:39:23.960]  whether we feel it
[3:39:23.960 --> 3:39:25.960]  or not I do I always am dialed in
[3:39:25.960 --> 3:39:27.960]  I feel it
[3:39:27.960 --> 3:39:29.960]  and you do too
[3:39:29.960 --> 3:39:31.960]  and we form in this
[3:39:31.960 --> 3:39:33.960]  kind of this over arching
[3:39:33.960 --> 3:39:35.960]  connection
[3:39:35.960 --> 3:39:37.960]  doesn't have to be formally organized
[3:39:37.960 --> 3:39:39.960]  in fact
[3:39:39.960 --> 3:39:41.960]  this is the power of
[3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:43.960]  it is formally organized
[3:39:43.960 --> 3:39:45.960]  and it was with
[3:39:45.960 --> 3:39:47.960]  the formation
[3:39:47.960 --> 3:39:49.960]  race
[3:39:49.960 --> 3:39:51.960]  so we already have that
[3:39:51.960 --> 3:39:53.960]  we have to remember I keep saying that
[3:39:53.960 --> 3:39:55.960]  all these new age
[3:39:55.960 --> 3:39:57.960]  folks talk about evolution
[3:39:57.960 --> 3:39:59.960]  evolving evolving forget
[3:39:59.960 --> 3:40:01.960]  that it's about remembering
[3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:03.960]  in the first place
[3:40:03.960 --> 3:40:05.960]  what we were created to be
[3:40:05.960 --> 3:40:07.960]  and do and then it's about
[3:40:07.960 --> 3:40:09.960]  relationship because here's it
[3:40:09.960 --> 3:40:11.960]  this is one of my things
[3:40:11.960 --> 3:40:13.960]  I ran into as a person in my 50s
[3:40:13.960 --> 3:40:15.960]  earlier a decade ago
[3:40:15.960 --> 3:40:17.960]  I thought everybody did this
[3:40:17.960 --> 3:40:19.960]  it was a big surprise to me when I look at someone
[3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:21.960]  look into their eyes I see their potential
[3:40:21.960 --> 3:40:23.960]  I begin to react accordingly
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:25.960]  as if they'd already realized
[3:40:25.960 --> 3:40:27.960]  and so they begin behaving often
[3:40:27.960 --> 3:40:29.960]  as if they had to
[3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:31.960]  because I see the success in them
[3:40:31.960 --> 3:40:33.960]  but this is what I found is
[3:40:33.960 --> 3:40:35.960]  that's great you know
[3:40:35.960 --> 3:40:37.960]  as a motivating force to do that
[3:40:37.960 --> 3:40:39.960]  a lot of people well I should say
[3:40:39.960 --> 3:40:41.960]  some people do that
[3:40:41.960 --> 3:40:43.960]  and all of us should try and do that
[3:40:43.960 --> 3:40:45.960]  but at the same time it really creates
[3:40:45.960 --> 3:40:47.960]  a lot of pain in your life
[3:40:47.960 --> 3:40:49.960]  because people let you down
[3:40:49.960 --> 3:40:51.960]  people are flawed so am I
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:40:53.960]  just like everyone else
[3:40:53.960 --> 3:40:55.960]  and so they let you down
[3:40:55.960 --> 3:40:57.960]  and then what do we do with that
[3:40:57.960 --> 3:40:59.960]  because we didn't meet people
[3:40:59.960 --> 3:41:01.960]  where they are
[3:41:01.960 --> 3:41:03.960]  this is really important
[3:41:03.960 --> 3:41:05.960]  I want to say it again
[3:41:05.960 --> 3:41:07.960]  because we didn't meet people where they are
[3:41:07.960 --> 3:41:09.960]  Christ met people where they are
[3:41:09.960 --> 3:41:11.960]  he knew where they could be
[3:41:11.960 --> 3:41:13.960]  but he met them where they were
[3:41:13.960 --> 3:41:15.960]  whether they were a whore in the street
[3:41:15.960 --> 3:41:17.960]  you know or a rich guy
[3:41:17.960 --> 3:41:19.960]  who couldn't get you know
[3:41:19.960 --> 3:41:21.960]  Camel had a better chance to get through the eye of a needle
[3:41:21.960 --> 3:41:23.960]  so you know whatever it was
[3:41:23.960 --> 3:41:25.960]  he met people where they were
[3:41:25.960 --> 3:41:27.960]  and but he saw where they could be
[3:41:27.960 --> 3:41:29.960]  this is our
[3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:31.960]  challenge individually
[3:41:31.960 --> 3:41:33.960]  as we look at ourselves
[3:41:33.960 --> 3:41:35.960]  and I've talked about this before
[3:41:35.960 --> 3:41:37.960]  and become all critical about all the flaws we see
[3:41:37.960 --> 3:41:39.960]  because we're the best besides God himself
[3:41:39.960 --> 3:41:41.960]  and all that
[3:41:41.960 --> 3:41:43.960]  and then we beat ourselves up
[3:41:43.960 --> 3:41:45.960]  in the total immobility
[3:41:45.960 --> 3:41:47.960]  because we feel so worthless
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:49.960]  no
[3:41:49.960 --> 3:41:51.960]  stop
[3:41:51.960 --> 3:41:53.960]  that's blasphemy against the creation
[3:41:53.960 --> 3:41:55.960]  stop doing that
[3:41:55.960 --> 3:41:57.960]  be critical for sure
[3:41:57.960 --> 3:41:59.960]  and then change
[3:41:59.960 --> 3:42:01.960]  forgive yourself
[3:42:01.960 --> 3:42:03.960]  how are you going to forgive anyone else
[3:42:03.960 --> 3:42:05.960]  if you can't get there
[3:42:05.960 --> 3:42:07.960]  forgive yourself
[3:42:07.960 --> 3:42:09.960]  change
[3:42:09.960 --> 3:42:11.960]  make a different choice
[3:42:11.960 --> 3:42:13.960]  and
[3:42:13.960 --> 3:42:15.960]  you'll screw it up probably a few times
[3:42:15.960 --> 3:42:17.960]  but keep standing back up
[3:42:17.960 --> 3:42:19.960]  and dusting yourself off
[3:42:19.960 --> 3:42:21.960]  and trying again
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:23.960]  that's the requirement
[3:42:23.960 --> 3:42:25.960]  meet people where they are
[3:42:25.960 --> 3:42:27.960]  first yourself
[3:42:27.960 --> 3:42:29.960]  clean up the program
[3:42:29.960 --> 3:42:31.960]  best you can but don't wait for perfection
[3:42:31.960 --> 3:42:33.960]  because you're not going to get that here
[3:42:33.960 --> 3:42:35.960]  be the flawed vessel
[3:42:35.960 --> 3:42:37.960]  that you are
[3:42:37.960 --> 3:42:39.960]  continue to make the improvements
[3:42:39.960 --> 3:42:41.960]  but then
[3:42:41.960 --> 3:42:43.960]  ask God to use you as an instrument anyway
[3:42:43.960 --> 3:42:45.960]  and if you don't know
[3:42:45.960 --> 3:42:47.960]  that God is real
[3:42:47.960 --> 3:42:49.960]  then ask at least
[3:42:49.960 --> 3:42:51.960]  to find the answer to that
[3:42:51.960 --> 3:42:53.960]  and ask for the path to be cleared
[3:42:53.960 --> 3:42:55.960]  so you might be able to
[3:42:55.960 --> 3:42:57.960]  and then you'll get somewhere
[3:42:57.960 --> 3:42:59.960]  maybe a little differently
[3:42:59.960 --> 3:43:01.960]  but all of us whether we like it or not
[3:43:01.960 --> 3:43:03.960]  in this
[3:43:03.960 --> 3:43:05.960]  and we're all going to be either aware of our participation
[3:43:05.960 --> 3:43:07.960]  or we're going to just unconsciously
[3:43:07.960 --> 3:43:09.960]  walk through
[3:43:09.960 --> 3:43:11.960]  this period of history
[3:43:11.960 --> 3:43:13.960]  this is the greatest
[3:43:13.960 --> 3:43:15.960]  period of history
[3:43:15.960 --> 3:43:17.960]  in my view
[3:43:17.960 --> 3:43:19.960]  to be alive
[3:43:19.960 --> 3:43:21.960]  we have all the potentials
[3:43:21.960 --> 3:43:23.960]  we have all of the possibilities
[3:43:23.960 --> 3:43:25.960]  if we can remember what we are
[3:43:25.960 --> 3:43:27.960]  and we drive the truck again
[3:43:27.960 --> 3:43:29.960]  all this junk that I've reported on
[3:43:29.960 --> 3:43:31.960]  all of us who have been in this for so long
[3:43:31.960 --> 3:43:33.960]  have been reported on
[3:43:33.960 --> 3:43:35.960]  for decades now
[3:43:35.960 --> 3:43:37.960]  is ultimately about
[3:43:37.960 --> 3:43:39.960]  people behaving
[3:43:39.960 --> 3:43:41.960]  badly
[3:43:41.960 --> 3:43:43.960]  that's it
[3:43:43.960 --> 3:43:45.960]  all the rest are expressions of that
[3:43:45.960 --> 3:43:47.960]  what I call the window dressing
[3:43:47.960 --> 3:43:49.960]  all the things we engage in as
[3:43:49.960 --> 3:43:51.960]  bodies running around
[3:43:51.960 --> 3:43:53.960]  with souls in them
[3:43:53.960 --> 3:43:55.960]  instead of souls running around
[3:43:55.960 --> 3:43:57.960]  a little more directional
[3:43:57.960 --> 3:43:59.960]  with a body to help out
[3:43:59.960 --> 3:44:01.960]  so get the position
[3:44:01.960 --> 3:44:03.960]  flip back around
[3:44:03.960 --> 3:44:05.960]  getting back your form
[3:44:05.960 --> 3:44:07.960]  and in the ego
[3:44:07.960 --> 3:44:09.960]  putting it behind you
[3:44:09.960 --> 3:44:11.960]  so the experiences, how we see ourselves
[3:44:11.960 --> 3:44:13.960]  our personalities, our thoughts, our emotions
[3:44:13.960 --> 3:44:15.960]  begin to serve the awareness that we are
[3:44:15.960 --> 3:44:17.960]  what?
[3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:19.960]  we say that again
[3:44:19.960 --> 3:44:21.960]  the ego part of us
[3:44:21.960 --> 3:44:23.960]  the thought, the emotion, the part that
[3:44:23.960 --> 3:44:25.960]  you play in this fear game
[3:44:25.960 --> 3:44:27.960]  the reasons why we can't
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:29.960]  subordinate that
[3:44:29.960 --> 3:44:31.960]  that's a different part of us
[3:44:31.960 --> 3:44:33.960]  that's important
[3:44:33.960 --> 3:44:35.960]  that's all of that part of us
[3:44:35.960 --> 3:44:37.960]  subordinate, aid it to the awareness
[3:44:37.960 --> 3:44:39.960]  how does that work?
[3:44:39.960 --> 3:44:41.960]  as soon as you feel emotions
[3:44:41.960 --> 3:44:43.960]  you pay attention to them
[3:44:43.960 --> 3:44:45.960]  you think about what am I thinking about
[3:44:45.960 --> 3:44:47.960]  now you're aware
[3:44:47.960 --> 3:44:49.960]  otherwise you're just jerked around
[3:44:49.960 --> 3:44:51.960]  emotionally, intellectually and otherwise
[3:44:51.960 --> 3:44:53.960]  by being so preoccupied
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:55.960]  you never bridge
[3:44:55.960 --> 3:44:57.960]  out
[3:44:57.960 --> 3:44:59.960]  I'm trying to give
[3:44:59.960 --> 3:45:01.960]  some formulations
[3:45:01.960 --> 3:45:03.960]  in the course of the last 7 or 8 broadcasts
[3:45:03.960 --> 3:45:05.960]  that
[3:45:05.960 --> 3:45:07.960]  are meant
[3:45:07.960 --> 3:45:09.960]  to wake us up a little bit
[3:45:09.960 --> 3:45:11.960]  they're the things that help me wake up a little bit
[3:45:13.960 --> 3:45:15.960]  so that we can express ourselves
[3:45:15.960 --> 3:45:17.960]  in a world that needs a different
[3:45:17.960 --> 3:45:19.960]  expression right now
[3:45:19.960 --> 3:45:21.960]  and it needs the force of our will as well
[3:45:21.960 --> 3:45:23.960]  there's lots of ways to do this
[3:45:23.960 --> 3:45:25.960]  there's intercessors out there
[3:45:25.960 --> 3:45:27.960]  you know who you are
[3:45:27.960 --> 3:45:29.960]  and you know what I'm talking about if you know who you are
[3:45:29.960 --> 3:45:31.960]  do that right now
[3:45:33.960 --> 3:45:35.960]  all of us are
[3:45:35.960 --> 3:45:37.960]  warriors engaged together
[3:45:37.960 --> 3:45:39.960]  in this last few minutes of the broadcast
[3:45:39.960 --> 3:45:41.960]  hold the thought
[3:45:41.960 --> 3:45:43.960]  visualize the country
[3:45:43.960 --> 3:45:45.960]  running like it should
[3:45:45.960 --> 3:45:47.960]  for this few moments
[3:45:47.960 --> 3:45:49.960]  with leadership
[3:45:49.960 --> 3:45:51.960]  that gets us
[3:45:51.960 --> 3:45:53.960]  as living souls
[3:45:53.960 --> 3:45:55.960]  and not as just taxpayers
[3:45:55.960 --> 3:45:57.960]  or consumers or something
[3:45:57.960 --> 3:45:59.960]  less than we are
[3:45:59.960 --> 3:46:01.960]  at a time when we need each other
[3:46:01.960 --> 3:46:03.960]  embrace yourself, embrace your family
[3:46:03.960 --> 3:46:05.960]  embrace your friends
[3:46:05.960 --> 3:46:07.960]  in this next week
[3:46:07.960 --> 3:46:09.960]  of total turmoil
[3:46:09.960 --> 3:46:11.960]  as we begin to lay the foundation
[3:46:11.960 --> 3:46:13.960]  for our futures in the new year
[3:46:13.960 --> 3:46:15.960]  this is Dr. Nick Begich
[3:46:15.960 --> 3:46:17.960]  and you're listening to
[3:46:17.960 --> 3:46:19.960]  The Washington Post
[3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:21.960]  with the White
[3:46:21.960 --> 3:46:47.960]  with the White
