[00:00.000 --> 00:17.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:17.280 --> 00:23.860]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot-com studios it's Alex
[00:23.860 --> 00:33.640]  Jones well it's a Friday February 9th 2018 and we have an absolutely loaded
[00:33.640 --> 00:39.200]  broadcast today not only do I have stacks and stacks of news got video
[00:39.200 --> 00:46.600]  clips that I got to get to but huge news as the stock market had good returns
[00:46.600 --> 00:51.720]  early it was the Dow was up everything was up early and then right about 9 30
[00:51.720 --> 00:57.880]  it started sliding then into 10 o'clock and now it is about what are we at
[00:57.880 --> 01:03.000]  about 150 down right now on the Dow today so we'll be continuing to monitor
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.840]  that at this rate it looks like it could be the worst week for the Dow in I
[01:09.840 --> 01:14.040]  think about about 20 years was the number so we'll continue to monitor that
[01:14.040 --> 01:20.320]  you've got new news breaking on Russian collusion no not Donald Trump no not
[01:20.320 --> 01:25.920]  Carter Page no not Paul Manafort no not Roger Stone no not anyone here at
[01:25.920 --> 01:30.400]  info wars but actually the Democrats that's right as well as all other kinds
[01:30.400 --> 01:38.000]  of news they're still freaking out about the military parade but Rand Paul was
[01:38.000 --> 01:43.480]  speaking on the floor last night to delay a vote because he didn't want the
[01:43.480 --> 01:47.000]  bill to get passed so the government got shut down then the bill passed this
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.720]  morning and the government is reopened but after Rand Paul gave his speech
[01:52.720 --> 01:57.560]  multiple people came out including a GOP lawmaker including bet middler the
[01:57.560 --> 02:01.760]  story is on info wars.com bet middler jokes about Rand Paul being violently
[02:01.760 --> 02:05.960]  assassinated GOP lawmaker after shut down it's easy to understand why Rand
[02:05.960 --> 02:09.680]  Paul's neighbor was so annoyed why do people hate Rand Paul so much let's go
[02:09.680 --> 02:14.600]  to his speech from last night and figure out why do people hate him so much on a
[02:14.600 --> 02:21.920]  bill that will add 1.5 trillion dollars to the debt over the next 10 years this
[02:21.920 --> 02:27.080]  is a large amount of money and something that we should be very wary of this is
[02:27.080 --> 02:32.280]  an addition to already running debt of nearly a trillion dollars so we're
[02:32.280 --> 02:35.480]  adding a couple hundred extra billion dollars a year this man wants to do
[02:35.480 --> 02:39.040]  something about the national debt and a congress you ought to be beaten
[02:39.040 --> 02:45.200]  recklessly let spending get out of control the bill is nearly 700 pages it
[02:45.200 --> 02:49.320]  was given to us at midnight last night and I would venture to say no one has
[02:49.320 --> 02:53.200]  read the bill no one can thoroughly digest the seven well we have to pass it
[02:53.200 --> 02:56.640]  to know what's in it that's what Nancy Pelosi told me and I do think we'll be
[02:56.640 --> 03:00.920]  hearing from that dingbat later we really really ought to talk about and how
[03:00.920 --> 03:04.680]  we should pay for them one of the things this bill gosh listen to this crazed
[03:04.680 --> 03:09.400]  lunatic was to balance a budget over a two-year was to do something about national
[03:09.400 --> 03:14.120]  debt what is wrong with this individual shut him down does that sound like a
[03:14.120 --> 03:18.520]  large amount anybody at home getting a bonus or an increase in your paycheck
[03:18.520 --> 03:24.840]  of 21% and yet your government's gonna spend 21% more without really having a
[03:24.840 --> 03:29.560]  full debate without having amendments the exchange you just watched was me
[03:29.560 --> 03:33.920]  asking to have a 15 minute vote I've been asking all day I've been asking all
[03:33.920 --> 03:39.720]  week for it we could have literally had dozens of votes today but we squabble
[03:39.720 --> 03:44.120]  because people don't want to be put on the spot so the reason I'm here tonight
[03:44.120 --> 03:49.000]  is to put people on the spot I want people to feel uncomfortable I want them
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.480]  to have to answer people at home who said how come you were against President
[03:53.480 --> 03:58.160]  Obama's deficits and then how come your for Republican deficits isn't that the
[03:58.160 --> 04:03.560]  very definition of intellectual dishonesty if you were against President
[04:03.560 --> 04:08.200]  Obama's death wow look at this man a man with principal isn't that the very
[04:08.200 --> 04:12.600]  man who stands for something of hypocrisy a man who's consistent unbelievable
[04:12.600 --> 04:17.080]  people need to be made aware that midler wants him violently assaulted you from
[04:17.080 --> 04:21.960]  home and they need to answer this debate we should have a full-throated debate my
[04:21.960 --> 04:26.880]  amendment says this simply we should obey the budget caps what are budget
[04:26.880 --> 04:32.080]  caps these are oh my gosh so so there's so there's Rand Paul you can pull him
[04:32.080 --> 04:36.920]  down guys there's Rand Paul saying hey look you know I complained about debt
[04:36.920 --> 04:39.920]  when it was Obama I'm gonna complain about the debt when it's Trump and then
[04:39.920 --> 04:43.680]  Charlie Dent a Republican from Pennsylvania says he understands why
[04:43.680 --> 04:48.880]  Rand Paul was attacked by his neighbor and then bet midler says where's Rand
[04:48.880 --> 04:52.880]  Paul's neighbor when we need him how dare a man in government have principal
[04:52.880 --> 04:57.680]  how dare you be consistent somebody beat him up

[06:43.760 --> 06:48.840]  hearing from Alex though at some point along this live broadcast spectacular
[06:48.840 --> 06:54.440]  today we've got Matt Bracken joining me at 12 30 central Dr. Jerry Corsi joins me
[06:54.440 --> 06:59.400]  at one o'clock central and I've got stacks of news all kinds of clips
[06:59.400 --> 07:06.240]  everything to get to as we are getting a more clearer picture of some of the
[07:06.240 --> 07:09.880]  intrigue involving the Me Too movement some of the intrigue in the White House
[07:09.880 --> 07:13.680]  and we're going to be talking about some of that today in the opening segment if
[07:13.680 --> 07:19.480]  you heard that you've got GOP lawmakers saying that they understand why Rand Paul
[07:19.480 --> 07:23.880]  got assaulted by his neighbor Bette Midler says where is Rand Paul's neighbor
[07:23.880 --> 07:27.160]  when we need him insinuating that he needs to come out onto the floor of
[07:27.160 --> 07:32.560]  Congress and beat Rand Paul up because he's giving a speech right now about the
[07:32.560 --> 07:36.920]  national debt that just continues to rise that the Republicans just signed a
[07:36.920 --> 07:41.760]  two-year funding bill that will increase the debt what are you gonna do you
[07:41.760 --> 07:47.760]  know what are you gonna do so you've got all of that going on government shut
[07:47.760 --> 07:51.880]  down last night government reopened today stock market up this morning now
[07:51.880 --> 07:59.160]  it's down currently we'll be monitoring that but how about the Russian collusion
[07:59.160 --> 08:06.760]  oh we are now down over 200 on the Dow so it is seeing fierce drops really ever
[08:06.760 --> 08:13.000]  since about 9 30 a.m. this morning when it was on the rise but how about Russian
[08:13.000 --> 08:22.160]  collusion man there sure is a lot of it isn't there except it's not from Donald
[08:22.160 --> 08:28.720]  Trump or the Republicans it's from Hillary Clinton and the Democrats now
[08:28.720 --> 08:38.120]  this is the story is Mark Warner is texting with Russian oligarchs in effort
[08:38.120 --> 08:45.120]  to contact Christopher Steele about the dossier and that is being called
[08:45.120 --> 08:49.720]  steals back channel to the Democrat senator was a lobbyist for Russians
[08:49.720 --> 08:58.840]  foreign minister so you've got Mark Warner communicating with Russians about
[08:58.840 --> 09:04.120]  the dossier which was meant to influence the 2016 election you've got
[09:04.120 --> 09:10.960]  Christopher Steele who was paid for through a conduit fusion GPS by Hillary
[09:10.960 --> 09:18.640]  Clinton to make up the fake dossier so you've got the Democrat presidential
[09:18.640 --> 09:22.720]  candidate Hillary Clinton colluding with Russians via Christopher Steele where
[09:22.720 --> 09:26.360]  do you think they got the intel on the dossier wasn't that used influence the
[09:26.360 --> 09:30.200]  election Hillary Clinton colluded with Russians to influence the election then
[09:30.200 --> 09:34.240]  you've got Mark Warner texting with Russians colluding with Russians about
[09:34.240 --> 09:40.520]  the dossier that was meant to influence the election so we flash back though
[09:40.520 --> 09:46.200]  because the Democrats are really hypocritical unlike Rand Paul who says
[09:46.200 --> 09:50.360]  I complained about increasing the debt when it was a Republican I complained
[09:50.360 --> 09:54.760]  about increasing the debt when it was a Democrat I'm complaining about it now
[09:54.760 --> 09:59.960]  because this isn't good we need to have a conversation the bill passed anyway
[09:59.960 --> 10:06.920]  but here is Mark Warner not consistent total double standard total hypocrite on
[10:06.920 --> 10:12.080]  Fox News saying he doesn't know anyone that would ever take a meeting with
[10:12.080 --> 10:20.800]  Russians I think that the president and frankly I can't believe what he's
[10:20.800 --> 10:27.840]  saying and here was in black and white an email that said this guy just get back
[10:27.840 --> 10:32.640]  from a Cyprus Hill concert acting as an Asian of the Russian government and this
[10:32.640 --> 10:37.840]  is part of the Russian government's effort then candidate Trump and to
[10:37.840 --> 10:42.560]  discredit Clinton I don't know anybody Democrat or Republican that would take
[10:42.560 --> 10:46.680]  that kind of meeting with not only a foreign government but a foreign
[10:46.680 --> 10:52.400]  adversary and frankly a government that we've learned was trying to hack into
[10:52.400 --> 10:57.720]  our whole electoral process and frankly fairly successfully was able to
[10:57.720 --> 11:03.720]  here wow a lot of claims there back in the day from Mark Warner none of them
[11:03.720 --> 11:10.040]  ended up being true not even a single one and then he gets caught colluding with
[11:10.040 --> 11:18.120]  Russians wow we're all shocked oh oh Donald Trump is just trying to discredit
[11:18.120 --> 11:24.560]  Hillary Clinton with these fake attacks wait wait Hillary Clinton paid for a
[11:24.560 --> 11:32.800]  fake dossier why is it even called a dossier it's a work of fiction it's made
[11:32.800 --> 11:39.320]  up it never happened it never existed it's a woozy and they use that to try to
[11:39.320 --> 11:44.000]  influence the election they use that to allow Hillary Clinton to spy on President
[11:44.000 --> 11:51.320]  Obama then in a whole that is that is that is a ballpark in and of itself then
[11:51.320 --> 11:55.920]  you have an entirely different ballpark with Hillary Clinton's email scandal
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.520]  being dropped by the FBI FBI the investigation President Obama wanting
[12:00.520 --> 12:04.640]  to know everything about the investigation why because he was
[12:04.640 --> 12:13.160]  involved because he knew because he was emailing that private server now you
[12:13.160 --> 12:18.500]  understand why Obama lawyered up now you understand why Obama didn't mind the
[12:18.500 --> 12:23.160]  Department of Justice and the FBI letting Hillary Clinton off writing her
[12:23.160 --> 12:28.600]  off before the investigation ever happened oh now you get it that's right
[12:28.600 --> 12:35.760]  so here's Matt Gates though from last night on Sean Hannity saying exactly
[12:35.760 --> 12:41.120]  what everyone with a working brain with a soul with a conscious is thinking
[12:41.120 --> 12:44.760]  right now in America the real question is whether or not there's going to be
[12:44.760 --> 12:48.480]  any consequences because the Clintons for decades are used to having a
[12:48.480 --> 12:52.000]  different standard of justice applied to them then is applied to the rest of the
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.080]  American people that's why I filed legislation with countless other
[12:56.080 --> 12:59.480]  conservative colleagues like Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan and Todd Rokita
[12:59.480 --> 13:03.360]  calling for a second special counsel to look into the Clinton Foundation in
[13:03.360 --> 13:06.720]  uranium one because I mean we can't have Mueller investigate he should have
[13:06.720 --> 13:10.560]  raised an objection we can't have Rosenstein investigate because we've
[13:10.560 --> 13:13.880]  already seen the extent to which he's tied up in a lot of these facts and Jeff
[13:13.880 --> 13:17.640]  Sessions has recused himself so the only way this doesn't become the next
[13:17.640 --> 13:21.320]  Benghazi where we stir up a bunch of facts but then let the Clintons off the
[13:21.320 --> 13:26.280]  hook is to appoint a special counsel and we need our general
[13:26.280 --> 13:31.480]  hmm well there you go saying what everybody is thinking why isn't Hillary
[13:31.480 --> 13:35.360]  Clinton's ass in jail why isn't Hillary Clinton been hauled in front of a
[13:35.360 --> 13:42.200]  grand jury why is it here you go and this is why Chuck Grassley is so smart
[13:42.200 --> 13:47.200]  because he realizes that Christopher Steele is the one that needs to talk
[13:47.200 --> 13:51.640]  right now what communication did Christopher Steele have with any of the
[13:51.640 --> 13:57.160]  following individuals Hillary Clinton Sydney Blumenthal Barack Obama before
[13:57.160 --> 14:04.160]  he wrote the fake dossier who were Christopher Steele sources in Russia
[14:04.160 --> 14:11.680]  that he used to make up the fake dossier did those sources even exist we're just
[14:11.680 --> 14:16.720]  going about what they're saying this is their story Steele's got five sources
[14:16.720 --> 14:21.040]  one of them domestically at least three in Russia that were working for the
[14:21.040 --> 14:30.280]  Russian government who were they and how is it that we live in a time that is
[14:30.280 --> 14:35.800]  not the twilight zone but is reality if you understand this you understand
[14:35.800 --> 14:42.360]  everything why did they say Trump colluded with Russia because they colluded
[14:42.360 --> 14:47.400]  with Russia why do they say Trump is some sort of pervert that abuses people
[14:47.400 --> 14:52.520]  because their perverts that abuse people why do they say that Donald Trump is a
[14:52.520 --> 14:59.200]  racist because they're racists and we I've got stacks of news proving all of
[14:59.200 --> 15:02.960]  that notice how they still have nothing to prove Donald Trump as any of the
[15:02.960 --> 15:06.840]  accusations they make against him zero this is just one day's worth of news
[15:06.840 --> 15:12.040]  where I prove everything about them that they accuse Trump of being but so what
[15:12.040 --> 15:17.680]  do they do they collude with the Russians to influence the 2016 election how
[15:17.680 --> 15:23.360]  do they do it they pay Christopher Steele to make up a story about Donald
[15:23.360 --> 15:28.440]  Trump he sources and cites at least three Russians that work for the Russian
[15:28.440 --> 15:33.360]  government to do that for that information so what do you call that do
[15:33.360 --> 15:37.800]  you call that Hillary Clinton colluding with foreign intelligence assets
[15:37.800 --> 15:42.640]  including Russian foreign intelligence assets to influence the 2016 election and
[15:42.640 --> 15:47.160]  then what do you call it when it's well known that's what went down and then the
[15:47.160 --> 15:53.080]  FISA court with the FBI and the DOJ signature uses that fake document to
[15:53.080 --> 15:59.720]  spy on American citizens you know what you call that treason hangable hello I'm

[20:36.920 --> 20:44.520]  alex jones at noon here in the info wars world headquarters in Austin Texas you
[20:44.520 --> 20:49.320]  know rob reiner is a bit of a nutcase he also likes to eat a lot of nuts and
[20:49.320 --> 20:54.240]  pretty much anything you put in front of him but uh he is actually kind of
[20:54.240 --> 20:58.440]  telling the truth about something he's a little confused about the issues as
[20:58.440 --> 21:02.640]  liberals are right now and we just say liberals these people aren't actually
[21:02.640 --> 21:08.800]  liberals they're brainwashed minions but he's talking about the civil war how
[21:08.800 --> 21:12.520]  they're actually fighting the civil war against Trump so he's he's kind of right
[21:12.520 --> 21:17.160]  there is a bit of a civil war right now but the bad guys are the people that are
[21:17.160 --> 21:21.960]  against Trump that's the establishment that's the globalist that's the
[21:21.960 --> 21:25.640]  anti-americans those are the racist those are the eugenicists those are the
[21:25.640 --> 21:30.880]  fake news media and that's who rob reiner has teamed up with here so they're
[21:30.880 --> 21:34.800]  admitting like yeah Trump is our enemy we're trying to take him out we're
[21:34.800 --> 21:37.760]  trying to ignite civil war we're trying to take down the Republicans the
[21:37.760 --> 21:40.440]  conservatives you know fight them in the streets fight them in Congress fight
[21:40.440 --> 21:44.720]  them everywhere kill Trump it's all good this is our civil war so here's rob
[21:44.720 --> 21:51.360]  reiner fresh off the buffet saying we are fighting our last battle of the
[21:51.360 --> 21:57.240]  civil war but then he gets into office and there are good people on both sides
[21:57.240 --> 22:04.520]  in Charlottesville and there are people coming from countries and it goes on and
[22:04.520 --> 22:08.080]  on and you see that's going on with rob reiner hires that are in his
[22:08.080 --> 22:16.040]  administration and we see that this now becomes the last battle of the civil
[22:16.040 --> 22:22.280]  war can rob make it and we're fighting it right now and we're gonna win we're
[22:22.280 --> 22:28.440]  gonna win but we thought we were on this slide path we've been dragged back and
[22:28.440 --> 22:32.760]  we're going to win because if we once he butters himself out of that limo he's
[22:32.760 --> 22:36.880]  going to win this country started as which is we are there goes we are all
[22:36.880 --> 22:45.280]  created equal that promise will not be realized unless we can overcome what
[22:45.280 --> 22:50.320]  has happened in this last election and I know it's been terrible oh what's
[22:50.320 --> 22:53.880]  happened in this last election look at the economy look at the jobs growth look
[22:53.880 --> 22:59.600]  at the oh oh it's so bad I mean I've got a story today that boy illegal border
[22:59.600 --> 23:07.160]  crossings are down I mean who would want that why what why are border cross
[23:07.160 --> 23:11.360]  illegal border crossings down this is terrible why is manufacturing coming
[23:11.360 --> 23:18.920]  back to America thought America was gonna be crushed I thought those races
[23:18.920 --> 23:26.520]  were gonna die now they get jobs back unemployment's down welfare is down do
[23:26.520 --> 23:33.560]  something about it Rob start a civil war Rob start a civil war Rob help me
[23:33.560 --> 23:39.440]  defeat America I can't stand it I can't stand these repatriation fees from
[23:39.440 --> 23:44.720]  Apple and all these companies billions of dollars it's just horrible people
[23:44.720 --> 23:50.240]  chanting USA on the Hill of Congress during the state of the Union people
[23:50.240 --> 23:55.440]  would dare chant USA don't they know how offensive that is
[23:57.360 --> 24:02.520]  once Rob Reiner finishes up at the buffet and butters himself out of his
[24:02.520 --> 24:07.520]  limo he's gonna lead us he's gonna lead us to victory in the civil war Rob Reiner
[24:07.520 --> 24:15.600]  he's the one yes Rob Reiner no maybe it's not Rob Reiner maybe it's psycho
[24:15.600 --> 24:20.720]  Keith Olbermann no no it's not Keith Olbermann he quit maybe it's psycho Joe
[24:20.720 --> 24:27.280]  Scarborough no no it's not him maybe it's Lena Dunham is it Lena Dunham no it's
[24:27.280 --> 24:32.240]  not Lena Dunham maybe it's Stephen Colbert no no it's not Stephen Colbert
[24:32.240 --> 24:36.400]  no it's none of those people no none of those people are leaders of a movement
[24:36.400 --> 24:41.920]  none of those people's are leader leaders of a revolution no they're
[24:41.920 --> 24:46.000]  leaders of soul-sucked brainwashed minions you know who is leading a
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.680]  revolution though President Donald Trump and and you'll notice how different
[24:52.680 --> 25:00.840]  things are today unless you're asleep nobody used to monitor the stock market
[25:00.840 --> 25:06.240]  at least on a wide national scale like they do today it used to be Fox business
[25:06.240 --> 25:09.480]  was the only thing that would monitor the stock market all day long now Fox news
[25:09.480 --> 25:16.040]  does it too that's different that's new that's people paying attention to the
[25:16.040 --> 25:18.720]  economy people paying attention to the stock market not because they're
[25:18.720 --> 25:22.880]  interested because they have financial interest but because they want to know
[25:22.880 --> 25:25.880]  about America they want to know about America's regrowth they want to know
[25:25.880 --> 25:29.880]  about the the boom that's happening in America right now they're curious they're
[25:29.880 --> 25:35.280]  looking at the results they're seeing what Trump has created they're seeing it
[25:35.280 --> 25:39.780]  in its infancy infancy and they're saying okay he's pulling all these
[25:39.780 --> 25:45.840]  regulations he's changing foreign policy he's ending political correctness he's
[25:45.840 --> 25:49.720]  filling he's fulfilling his promises that's unheard of as far as the president
[25:49.720 --> 25:52.840]  is concerned fulfilling promises from the campaign I mean how often do you have
[25:52.840 --> 25:56.360]  that happen other than never so they're kind of watching and they're curious
[25:56.360 --> 26:00.520]  all right what's going on here all right manufacturing coming back welfare
[26:00.520 --> 26:05.000]  going down food stamps usage going down repatriation fees we get tax cuts people
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.720]  are getting bonuses hmm wages are going up not because of somebody wrote a law
[26:09.720 --> 26:14.840]  but because we cut the taxes and Trump is making deals with these companies and
[26:14.840 --> 26:18.200]  he's calling them and he's on the phone all day all night making deals cutting
[26:18.200 --> 26:23.240]  deals getting manufacturing back cutting taxes and then Rob Reiner and
[26:23.240 --> 26:29.800]  Stephen Colbert and the rest of this anti-American low-life libtard filth is
[26:29.800 --> 26:33.400]  going to tell you you're having a civil war a revolutionary war against
[26:33.400 --> 26:39.400]  yourself in no other world other than the twilight zone can you convince a
[26:39.400 --> 26:43.320]  group of people that they are fighting a war for the good against their own
[26:43.320 --> 26:48.440]  self-interest except here in America you want to fight the civil war destroy
[26:48.440 --> 26:53.320]  America but I'm an American well you're a racist and that's their logic and
[26:53.320 --> 26:55.560]  that's what you get from the entertainment industry in Hollywood
[26:55.560 --> 26:58.840]  that's what you get from the liberal higher education system at the
[26:58.840 --> 27:03.880]  universities that's what you get when you're dumbed down by all the chemicals
[27:03.880 --> 27:07.480]  in the water in the food and then you can't even think for yourself and then
[27:07.480 --> 27:12.680]  you believe someone like Stephen Colbert who came out with a new cartoon
[27:12.680 --> 27:18.680]  we'll be playing that later but check out this study study finds releases this

[33:45.920 --> 33:49.760]  elected him for that's what we have a country for it's what we have borders
[33:49.760 --> 33:56.800]  for and then Mattis Maddog Mattis says immigrant service members won't face
[33:56.800 --> 34:05.240]  deportation you know I'm really getting irritated about this this statement is
[34:05.240 --> 34:10.920]  inherently factual you shouldn't have to make this statement you shouldn't have
[34:10.920 --> 34:14.600]  to say that immigrant service members won't face deportation why are we

[34:24.160 --> 34:29.640]  immigrant service members won't face deportation immigrants won't face
[34:29.640 --> 34:38.520]  deportation why do we refuse to address this as it should be why do we
[34:38.520 --> 34:44.520]  conservatives why do we whatever you want to clarify us as Trumpist righties
[34:44.520 --> 34:51.440]  whatever I don't care why do we not get this battle why do we not dominate this
[34:51.440 --> 34:59.280]  battle illegal immigrants so is is Mattis saying illegal immigrant service
[34:59.280 --> 35:02.520]  members won't face deportation because immigrant service members should have
[35:02.520 --> 35:06.880]  never faced deportation to begin with if you're an immigrant you followed the
[35:06.880 --> 35:13.800]  law and you are a citizen here I'm just really not understanding this what are
[35:13.800 --> 35:17.720]  you guys showing me here the crew has pulled something up here legal
[35:17.720 --> 35:25.120]  immigration versus illegal immigration this is a book this is a book and
[35:25.120 --> 35:30.360]  attended attended for grades six to eight no but that's what I'm saying it's
[35:30.360 --> 35:36.120]  like this is so common this is such common sense like why do we lose this
[35:36.120 --> 35:41.440]  battle legal immigration versus illegal immigration that you don't even need a
[35:41.440 --> 35:46.480]  textbook so why why does Defense Secretary Mattis say immigrant service
[35:46.480 --> 35:51.120]  members won't face deportation that's a given that should be a given why are we
[35:51.120 --> 35:57.040]  losing this battle because Democrats are lying because fake liberals libtards
[35:57.040 --> 36:00.960]  are lying to you they're telling you Trump wants to deport immigrants that is
[36:00.960 --> 36:05.640]  a lie it's not immigrants it's illegal immigrants and when Mattis and others
[36:05.640 --> 36:10.160]  make comments like this this gives them a victory we cannot give them victory
[36:10.160 --> 36:15.200]  immigrants will not be deported US citizens do not get deported if you
[36:15.200 --> 36:19.880]  follow the law and came here legally in our immigrant nobody wants to deport you
[36:19.880 --> 36:26.560]  nobody's anti-immigrant we're pro-immigrant we're anti illegal immigration please
[36:26.560 --> 36:29.840]  conservatives everyone in right-wing media whatever you want to call it
[36:29.840 --> 36:35.000]  Trump supporters we need to stop losing this battle of vernacular do not let
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.760]  Democrats win this battle of lexicon and just group illegal immigrants and
[36:40.760 --> 36:45.200]  immigrants together in the same class they are not that is anti-immigrant to
[36:45.200 --> 36:50.320]  put ant to put illegal immigrants in the same class of people as immigrants is
[36:50.320 --> 36:57.000]  anti-immigrant that's the Democrats so that's how we need to approach this in
[36:57.000 --> 37:04.960]  the future meanwhile you know Nancy Pelosi nobody knows how she did it but
[37:04.960 --> 37:09.680]  miracles happen folks and Nancy Pelosi went eight straight hours on the floor a
[37:09.680 --> 37:15.800]  one-minute matching waters gave her one minute maxine waters to she's like oh oh
[37:15.800 --> 37:19.600]  it was the best one minute ever that I could have given to Nancy Pelosi so then
[37:19.600 --> 37:23.960]  Nancy Pelosi goes on for eight hours I mean you can only imagine the golden
[37:23.960 --> 37:29.440]  there here's some of it Nancy Pelosi first she's going to show how racist she
[37:29.440 --> 37:33.320]  is and then she just has vomit at the mouth at the end of this she can't even
[37:33.320 --> 37:37.960]  make sense so here's Nancy Pelosi part of one of the great memories from her
[37:37.960 --> 37:46.880]  eight-hour speech I'm reminded of my own grandson he's a is he a dreamer Irish
[37:46.880 --> 37:52.680]  English whatever whatever and Italian American he's is the mix all right pause
[37:52.680 --> 37:56.800]  right there pause right there let me explain this is actually key because
[37:56.800 --> 38:00.080]  because Nancy Pelosi's actually pretty smart I'll give her credit she is smart
[38:00.080 --> 38:02.640]  when it comes to this she still has a little brain function when it comes to
[38:02.640 --> 38:08.960]  this what does she mean there she's actually saying white my grandson is
[38:08.960 --> 38:13.920]  white but she won't say it because they've already been outed as anti-white
[38:13.920 --> 38:17.760]  racist so they know not to say white anymore so they say oh you know he's a
[38:17.760 --> 38:22.400]  mix of Irish Italian oh no he's white that's what she's saying my grandson is
[38:22.400 --> 38:26.800]  white so just understand she's she's just using all of this language to confuse
[38:26.800 --> 38:31.720]  you and disorient you what she's saying is my grandson is white now finish this
[38:31.720 --> 38:37.880]  clip the other side of the family should we say he's and he does he looks white
[38:37.880 --> 38:43.520]  here pause it that's what you think you know because she's Italian and apparently
[38:43.520 --> 38:48.040]  she's not a fan of her own heritage where they've ended Columbus Day in San
[38:48.040 --> 38:52.840]  Francisco in California you know the Italians over there so but she's saying
[38:52.840 --> 38:56.920]  he you know he's he's Irish he's English she's got a little Italian but he looks
[38:56.920 --> 39:01.280]  white he's a whitey he's a white boy okay again so it's she won't say it that's
[39:01.280 --> 39:03.600]  what she's saying though it's key to it's key to understand she's saying my
[39:03.600 --> 39:07.960]  grandson is white all right now now she can finish it's fifth birthday sixth
[39:07.960 --> 39:12.360]  birthday he had a very close friend his name is Antonio who's from Guatemala and
[39:12.360 --> 39:19.960]  he has beautiful tanned skin beautiful brown eyes and a little creepy and this
[39:19.960 --> 39:24.480]  was such a proud day for me because when my grandson blew out the candles on his
[39:24.480 --> 39:29.120]  cake they said did you make a wish and he said yes I made a wish he said well
[39:29.120 --> 39:33.560]  what is your wish she said I wish I had brown skin and brown eyes like Antonio
[39:33.560 --> 39:40.000]  pause her right there now why is she so proud of this what what is what is she
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.120]  saying here did she train her grandchild to be an a racist against his own white
[39:45.120 --> 39:54.320]  skin imagine that that is what's the Mad Hatter Barbara Jackson Lee or something
[39:54.320 --> 39:58.040]  what's the Mad Hatter's name guys Fred Rica Jackson Lee or something you know
[39:58.040 --> 40:02.640]  who I'm talking about Sheila Jackson Lee thank you imagine Sheila Jackson Lee
[40:02.640 --> 40:09.680]  giving the same speech saying my grandchild who's you know African African
[40:09.680 --> 40:15.320]  African American and he was at his fourth birthday and his his his white
[40:15.320 --> 40:21.320]  friend was or his his his English Italian Irish friend was at the party and
[40:21.320 --> 40:28.360]  his beautiful white skin and blue eyes and my and my my grandson made a wish and
[40:28.360 --> 40:32.640]  and I said what did you wish for and my grandson said oh I wish I had beautiful
[40:32.640 --> 40:37.960]  white skin like my friend Peter now can you imagine first of all that would
[40:37.960 --> 40:43.800]  never happen but can you imagine if that was the optics and the situation here
[40:43.800 --> 40:48.400]  so here's Nancy Pelosi saying oh look at this it's all about being beautiful with
[40:48.400 --> 40:51.720]  your brown skin and regretting that you're white and wishing that you weren't
[40:51.720 --> 40:56.520]  white and wishing that you were tan what is wrong with this woman indoctrinated
[40:56.520 --> 40:59.600]  can you imagine how messed up these kids minds are when they get to college
[40:59.600 --> 41:03.480]  they've been told their whole life that white is bad they're bad America's bad
[41:03.480 --> 41:07.080]  no wonder they say death to America in the streets no wonder they're protesting
[41:07.080 --> 41:10.520]  against the growth of America no wonder they hate President Trump they've been
[41:10.520 --> 41:13.000]  lied to and tricked and indoctrinated their whole lives into hating
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.400]  themselves finish with Pelosi so beautiful no it's so beautiful isn't it the
[41:18.400 --> 41:22.640]  beauty is in the mix now listen to how she just vomit at the mouth here at the
[41:22.640 --> 41:27.440]  end all-american and that all America has many versions
[41:27.440 --> 41:34.760]  cook long socks go what none of my friends from my hometown know he's my
[41:34.760 --> 41:40.480]  parents raised me to be gritty complain or take I didn't want to have a
[41:40.480 --> 41:45.600]  victim mentality after that she really struggled I think her dentures may have
[41:45.600 --> 41:48.840]  fallen out or something she needed to get the you know get the old dentures
[41:48.840 --> 41:54.920]  fixed but now here's Chris Matthews listen to Chris Matthews on MSNBC listen
[41:54.920 --> 42:01.120]  to his response to this let me talk to you I will tell me Chris picking us
[42:01.120 --> 42:05.320]  somebody from one of the coasts usually ethnic and making them the poster
[42:05.320 --> 42:09.960]  party is old business for the republicans they did it with we're
[42:09.960 --> 42:13.880]  making her the post of the Democrat Party for the Bronx back in the 40s they
[42:13.880 --> 42:17.720]  did it they did it with Bella I'm so from what west side of New York City they
[42:17.720 --> 42:20.560]  did at their tip on the other tip to Teddy now they're doing that Teddy Kane
[42:20.560 --> 42:25.400]  now they do it after after Nancy Pelosi they love to get an ethnic sort of person
[42:25.400 --> 42:33.120]  from one of the coasts and make them the bad person that didn't make sense so now
[42:33.120 --> 42:38.720]  Nancy Nancy Pelosi is considered an ethnic person from the coast and that is
[42:38.720 --> 42:42.960]  our target to target ethnic people from the coast and we made Nancy Pelosi a
[42:42.960 --> 42:47.960]  poster child for the Democrats no you did that and Nancy Pelosi just admitted
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.700]  in her own speech she hates her own white skin oh but leave it to Chris
[42:52.700 --> 42:57.000]  Matthews and MSNBC to tell you the opposite of the truth that's what

[51:05.960 --> 51:10.640]  engaged which we have the most active and engaged audience out there which you
[51:10.640 --> 51:15.480]  can see in proof when we have challenges like the Bill Clinton is a rapist
[51:15.480 --> 51:18.720]  challenge she and in his fake news challenge and then we get this huge
[51:18.720 --> 51:23.320]  support this huge draw of people interested in it and right now we've
[51:23.320 --> 51:29.720]  got the patriot challenge so this actually to my surprise has not gotten as
[51:29.720 --> 51:36.400]  much attention there's my first patriot challenge I I was reading from the
[51:36.400 --> 51:40.440]  Nunez memo on the steps of the state Capitol building in Austin I was trying
[51:40.440 --> 51:43.040]  to alert the people that there's been treason at the highest levels of
[51:43.040 --> 51:46.360]  government so that was part of my patriot challenge I then handed out 50
[51:46.360 --> 51:51.840]  Nunez memos on the state Capitol so that was just my patriot challenge but I've
[51:51.840 --> 51:56.200]  got I've gotten some of these back I've been put in charge of monitoring this
[51:56.200 --> 52:01.480]  which means that I guess I can't give the top prize to myself of $10,000 even
[52:01.480 --> 52:05.160]  though right now I have to say none of the info warriors have beaten my
[52:05.160 --> 52:08.920]  patriot challenge so I'm laying down the gauntlet for the patriot challenge
[52:08.920 --> 52:14.120]  $10,000 first prize $5,000 second prize $3,000 or $1,000 third
[52:14.120 --> 52:20.400]  prize folks this is all about letting your fellow Americans know that you're a
[52:20.400 --> 52:25.120]  patriot and that you're proud to be a patriot and it's the whole reason why
[52:25.120 --> 52:29.400]  I wanted to do this a was because I think it's time for we the people to start
[52:29.400 --> 52:32.000]  calling out this treason at the highest levels of government from the top of the
[52:32.000 --> 52:35.120]  mountain I mean we have to we have to force this home we've caught him red
[52:35.120 --> 52:41.360]  handed just like Trump said but this is about patriots and Americans no longer
[52:41.360 --> 52:45.040]  being afraid to share their opinion no long no longer being afraid to say I
[52:45.040 --> 52:48.560]  love America no longer being afraid to stand up in front of their family and
[52:48.560 --> 52:52.760]  friends on the steps of a Cape Capitol building whatever it is and say I love
[52:52.760 --> 52:56.480]  America I'm a proud patriot and I'm gonna stand up for this country I'm gonna
[52:56.480 --> 52:59.360]  stand up for veterans I'm gonna stand up for the anthem I'm gonna be proud of my
[52:59.360 --> 53:03.240]  flag I'm gonna be proud of my my heritage that's what this is about no
[53:03.240 --> 53:07.960]  longer being intimidated by the violent left no longer being intimidated by the
[53:07.960 --> 53:12.660]  radical left into suppressing your conservative views suppressing your
[53:12.660 --> 53:16.200]  pro-american views suppressing your support of Trump that's what this is
[53:16.200 --> 53:21.960]  about it's about taking the culture back oh they're allowed to do a mannequin
[53:21.960 --> 53:26.200]  challenge and that goes viral all over you know professional sports teams you
[53:26.200 --> 53:29.560]  can do an ice bucket challenge and all the celebrities want to do the ice bucket
[53:29.560 --> 53:35.000]  challenge hell you can even do a tide pod challenge you can eat laundry
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.760]  detergent and it goes viral well why can't we have a patriot challenge go
[53:38.760 --> 53:43.320]  viral why can't the patriot challenge go massively viral so that's what Alex
[53:43.320 --> 53:46.800]  Jones wants to do that's why he laid out the prize and that's why I went on the
[53:46.800 --> 53:51.320]  streets of Austin Texas and laid down the gauntlet so folks hey guys pull up
[53:51.320 --> 53:56.080]  the rules page if you can at info wars.com here we've got a rule page if

[55:37.320 --> 55:41.760]  highest levels of government because that's the most powerful video you can
[55:41.760 --> 55:45.800]  get and that's what we want but if you want to do something else like sing the
[55:45.800 --> 55:51.280]  national anthem you know read a poem at school whatever it is do do you know I
[55:51.280 --> 55:54.680]  don't know get creative think about it for yourself again what I did for my
[55:54.680 --> 55:58.320]  first one was I just went to the steps of the Capitol building and with my
[55:58.320 --> 56:01.520]  bullhorn and was talking about treason at the highest levels of government the
[56:01.520 --> 56:06.800]  next day I went out and I handed out 50 Nunez memos so again get creative what
[56:06.800 --> 56:11.080]  what compels you go decorate a war memorial talk about how important it is
[56:11.080 --> 56:14.360]  that we have people that are willing to put their lives on the line just for the
[56:14.360 --> 56:19.080]  ideals of freedom in this country so that is the hashtag patriot challenge we
[56:19.080 --> 56:23.560]  wanted to go viral we want people to be proud to be Americans no longer should
[56:23.560 --> 56:28.840]  we the people be oppressed and feel that our views are suppressed because of the
[56:28.840 --> 56:32.960]  threat of violence and that's what the radical left has done they've used the
[56:32.960 --> 56:38.160]  threat of violence they've used their liberal media complex their Democrat
[56:38.160 --> 56:42.560]  media complex to suppress our views and intimidate us out of our views well

[57:13.760 --> 57:17.600]  standing in the face of the violent left standing in the face of the radical
[57:17.600 --> 57:20.640]  left standing in the face of the Democrat media complex that wants to

[59:51.040 --> 01:00:07.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show you are listening to an info wars dot
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:12.680]  com frontline report if you are receiving this transmission you are the
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:26.400]  resistance from deep in the heart of FEMA region 6 Austin Texas transmitting
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:36.320]  worldwide it's Alex Jones that's right we were the resistance first we were the
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.800]  resistance before the liberal democrat media complex told you it was cool we
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.760]  were the resistance when we found out that there was a shadow government a
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:51.720]  secret society if you will of globalists an international consortium of power
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:57.680]  brokers that wanted to bring America to its knees and eventually bring in a
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.200]  world government but they knew they knew that they could never have their
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:08.640]  world government if America existed they knew they could never have their
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:17.080]  world government if the star-spangled banner if old glory wasn't still waving
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:22.520]  over the land of the free and the home of the brave so now that we have Trump
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:30.160]  who's done more for America its culture its borders its economy than any other
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:36.320]  president perhaps any other person in decades and they hate him for it why
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:42.760]  because what they've done is they've used their media to deceive the public now
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:47.760]  you can find examples of this obviously on the CNN's and the MSNBC's that's a
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:54.440]  given but their ultimate tool their ultimate weapon is Hollywood and the
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:59.280]  entertainment industry in these late-night talk shows where people tune
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.680]  in and whenever you're watching it's like this you have to understand the
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.960]  psychology whenever you're watching something that's a comedy you tend to
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:13.520]  be more vulnerable more open you're not as critically thinking you're loose
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:20.000]  you're freewheeling and so they use comedy when you're vulnerable when your
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.640]  mind is vulnerable like that to inject their propaganda into you and Stephen
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:31.360]  Colbert is the perfect example so now Colbert is about to launch some new
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:36.560]  cartoon called our cartoon president here is a clip of Colbert plugging that on
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:42.520]  a CBS talk show I'm just saying I'd love to spend more time with the kids plus
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.480]  the military pretty much runs the government now I mean they don't even
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:49.920]  let me come to meetings anymore you are a figurehead so you must wave to the
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.320]  sick and dying I guess you're right the people need my folksy relatable
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:58.000]  presence sir the advanced team has purelled the victims and moved the
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.720]  eights and nines to the front no 10s why did I even want this job oh yeah
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.360]  Obama made fun of me once so every night you get a chance to talk about so
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.320]  now they go to Colbert there was a little clip from the cartoon series now
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.800]  they go to talk about because there's still more Stephen Colbert the Alex
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.880]  Jones want to be happen when the camera isn't pointed at him there's
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.800]  everything that we hear about happening in the White House but we never get to
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:26.200]  see and we're so honored here oh yeah because Obama was so transparent out in
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.680]  our cartoon cameras it's really here he is you pause right there so that's what
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:34.000]  he's saying he's like well I'm just trying to give the people a look at what
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.800]  goes on behind the closed doors here that's what my cartoon is about oh yeah
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.960]  yeah Trump ran for president because Obama insulted him once yeah yeah Trump
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.200]  wants to you know I don't know what the reference there is but he's cleaning up
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:50.800]  some victims let's say from Puerto Rico and he's having the general bring the
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.480]  good-looking women to him I mean give me a break but this is see but that's why
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.200]  they use comedy because they know when you're watching comedy your mind is more
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.680]  vulnerable psychology the psychology of that is that your mind is more vulnerable
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:09.840]  you're more open to ridiculous ideas okay the Mitch McConnell turkey neck that's
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:18.600]  actually pretty funny I mean this I look if I knew this wasn't propaganda or if
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.040]  I if I knew if I didn't know let me put it this way if I didn't know this was
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:27.560]  propaganda I guess maybe it could be funny but it's total propaganda they're
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:32.360]  gonna use this cartoon because the average person doesn't follow Trump doesn't
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:36.800]  follow the news doesn't have a clue but they'll watch this cartoon and with their
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.160]  open vulnerable state of mind while watching a comedy they'll get that
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.040]  propaganda shoved in their face and they'll just accept it and then watch
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:47.440]  what'll happen watch what'll happen they'll have some talking point in that
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.920]  show like Trump only ran because Obama insulted him then I'll go out on the
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.560]  streets and say why don't you like Trump and they'll be like he only ran
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:59.360]  because Obama insulted him you watch that will happen you know I've got some
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:03.840]  talking points here about caveman from info wars life.com but instead of going
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.400]  with those talking points let me just give you what I've experienced personally

[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:28.680]  To get to you know it's like a whirlwind of news today and you just have to you
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.340]  just have to bear down and focus and say this is what I'm going with so this is
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:35.120]  what we're doing with this segment before we're joined by Alex Jones coming up
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:44.400]  in the next segment. Trump suggests perhaps having a military parade and the
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.080]  media freaks out and the Democrats freak out and this can remind you of a
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.600]  moment we had earlier where Trump said that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:56.920]  and what happened the media and the Democrats freaked out but what's strange
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:02.800]  about that is that Bill Clinton George Bush and President Obama all said the
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:08.320]  same thing none of them followed through on that because they're frauds and also
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.400]  the media didn't freak out when they said it maybe that's because they knew
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.680]  they were frauds and they knew Trump was for real and that's why they freak out
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:18.640]  when Trump says and does things because they know he's real but of course that's
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:23.000]  what it is but now it's the military parade so Trump calls for military parade
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.080]  and folks this is this is twisted left and right in five ways to Sunday let me
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:35.520]  tell you the mental gymnastics that a modern-day leftist has to do to present
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.800]  this argument this anti-military parade is really shocking and I'm gonna break
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.400]  this down for you but you heard it on the Jones show yesterday Arne
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:48.040]  Manchoni Manchoni macaroni whatever his name is saying he's gonna lay down in
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:51.680]  front of the tanks he's got 50 people that are gonna lay down in front of the
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:57.600]  tanks signaling Tiananmen Square where the oppressive dictatorship of Mao
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:02.680]  Saitang and the China Chinese Communist regime was actually oppressing people
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:06.440]  that was a symbol of courage to step in front of it to say no you're not going
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:11.040]  to oppress the people anymore but then Trump wants to do it to celebrate the
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:16.000]  military celebrate the return of America and give our veterans give our
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.120]  soldiers give our troops a moment in the spotlight to be lifted up and
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.080]  cheered for because they don't get it enough you know it's all about the
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:27.480]  athletes and the Kardashians and the and the stars they're the idols well
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:30.280]  no how about brave men and women that put their lives on the line for something
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:34.180]  bigger than them those are the real stars those are the real heroes but the
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:39.160]  left hates them and that's why they hate the concept of military parade so but
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:43.840]  just to just to remind you about how fake the liberal media really is just
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:48.080]  remind you how fake their hatred of Trump really is here's Chuck Schumer from
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:54.680]  2014 calling for a military parade where was the media after all these men risk
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.640]  their lives to protect us they experience terrible trauma and tragedy along
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:03.200]  the way senator Charles Schumer is appealing to the Department of Defense
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:07.400]  for approval of a grand event up the canyon of heroes that would include
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:12.360]  military brass color guards military bands and flyovers it's still in the
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.400]  planning stages but do the officials say it's certainly that ticker tape parade
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:21.400]  I you know what I hope Trump does it and I hope that I get the honor to go
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:26.040]  cover it for info wars that would be awesome but let's recall where these
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:32.440]  people stand these people hate America these people hate capitalism they like
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.200]  communism but now there's this weird thing where they're comparing Trump in
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:44.440]  a negative light to communist regimes like North Korea and the former Soviet
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.680]  Union they're saying look at this Trump he wants to have a military parade Allah
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:56.120]  North Korea Allah Mao say tongue it's like wait a second are you dissing
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.360]  communism now because a minute ago you liked communism now you don't like
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.240]  communism oh that's right it's whatever is anti-trump that's all it is they
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.600]  don't actually have a solid state of beliefs they don't actually have
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:12.000]  principles they're they're they're liquid they wait and see where Trump
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.680]  stands on an issue and then they go opposite that Trump says let's cure
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:20.200]  cancer they say let's all die of cancer Trump says let's have a strong border
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:24.400]  they say I want open borders every other president says Jerusalem the capital
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:27.960]  of Israel silence Trump says really is the capital of Israel everyone freaks
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:31.800]  out Chuck Schumer says let's have a military parade no big deal Trump says
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.600]  let's have a military parade it's the worst thing in the world now here's the
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:39.040]  occupied Democrats and it only gets weirder from here are these people pro
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:44.800]  communism anti-communism they don't know it's whatever's anti-trump oh yeah they
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.720]  really hate the concept of a military parade Donald Trump wants to go full
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:53.920]  Kim Jong-un with an over-the-top military parade Kim John just in
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:57.280]  Dallemore with the occupied Democrat support let me just pause it right here
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:02.760]  real quick one thing that we don't like to do here at Info Wars is punch down
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:07.840]  this is this is probably me like having to shrink myself down to about an inch
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:12.560]  tall to even punch down at this nitwit but again I just want to expose you how
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.320]  how their double-think and mental gymnastics actually work how does he
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:21.320]  start it he's going full Kim Jong-un dude last month you were on Kim Jong-un
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.080]  side when Trump tweeted about a nuclear button these people don't even know and
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:31.360]  they don't even understand see they they have the memory of a goldfish so they
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.800]  say something and they don't they just forget it it's like it never happened we
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:40.000]  remember what you said last month dude you were actually on North Korea side
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.680]  against Trump now you're saying Trump's going for North full North Korea as if
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.160]  it's a bad thing let's go back to this midget
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.800]  mental midget in a step to fulfill the fantasy in his mind that he is an
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:57.480]  authoritarian thug just like I wish Trump was an authoritarian because you'd
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:02.080]  be arrested and thrown in prison that's what these people don't understand if
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:05.920]  Trump wasn't authoritarian where do you think all of these detractors would be
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:11.880]  right now get moe you're lucky he's not an authoritarian you nitwit is Russian
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:17.120]  overlord Vladimir Putin Russian overlord ordered the Pentagon put out put on a
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:22.400]  grand military parade in the streets of Washington D.C. pause it right there you
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.560]  don't a grand military parade a grand military parade well is our military not
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:33.840]  grand are our service members not grand are the veterans not grand or are the
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:38.360]  troops the Marines these people that put it on the line are they not venerable
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:43.760]  oh to grow it's a grand he says oh it's a grand yeah it is pretty grand yeah I
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.320]  happen to think that people that serve this country and put their lives on the
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.880]  line I think they're pretty grand yeah yeah and maybe Trump does too and you
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.200]  want to make a joke of it you want to make a mockery of it go back to this
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:59.080]  clown who was millions of dollars and served to the benefit of millions of
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:03.800]  dollars who was millions of dollars how much money has Robert Mueller spent
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.920]  probably the tune of over 20 million dollars investigating Donald Trump's
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:12.960]  Russian collusion that never existed they knew it never existed it was made up
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:18.000]  from the beginning he has no problem with that though 20 million 40 million
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.800]  a hundred million spend whatever it takes to bury Trump in fake fake news but
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:28.200]  celebrating our military you know God forbid I mean the Philadelphia Eagles
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.520]  just had a Super Bowl parade that probably cost a lot of money you know
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.200]  the night the night they won the Super Bowl people were riding in the streets
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.760]  burning things flipping cars destroying property eating eating horse turds
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:42.940]  that's a real story that's cool that's fine but celebrate the military lift
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:46.600]  up the troops and the veterans well that's just some grand well that's just
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.680]  some he's just trying to be grandiose no it's not that the military is grand it's
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:54.320]  that Trump just wants to make a big deal of it right why can't we celebrate the
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:58.360]  military why do these people hate America so much go back to this clown one
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:06.760]  except of course Donald Trump and his fragile self-worth he's so fragile
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:12.200]  he's been able to endure your attacks for over two years now and size of our
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:17.320]  military capabilities I mentioned size because ultimately that's what little
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:21.560]  Donnie is trying to measure here the problem lies in the fact that this is
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:26.360]  completely unnecessary there is no mistake or debate about the issues
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:34.240]  related to the sheer power and strength of our military might yesterday the
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.040]  Washington Post ran a story saying if Trump had a military parade it wouldn't
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:44.400]  compare to North Korea's I'm dead serious pull up this story guys you can't
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.280]  believe this stuff again that's what I'm telling you sometimes they're on North
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:54.400]  Korea's side it's like are you for North Korea are you for communism or are you
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.520]  against it you don't even know you don't even know it's always whatever is
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:03.240]  against Trump it's always whatever makes Trump look bad you don't have any
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:07.720]  beliefs you don't have any principles you have nothing the Democrats have
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.560]  nothing that's why they can't win anything there's the Washington Post why
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:15.080]  Trump's military parade could not compare to North Korea's all right let's
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:20.040]  finish it off with this this this goon more on defense than the next several
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:26.480]  nations combined in fact would that mean our military's grand for the research
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.440]  and development of new weapons and equipment is almost 65 billion dollars
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:35.760]  which for the record is more right so for the record get him off get him out
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.600]  put him back in the hole he came from so for the record the Democrats hate
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:44.760]  America the Democrats hate the military the Democrats hate the veterans they
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:48.920]  don't want them to get the proper care at the VA the Democrats just hate you
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:52.080]  they don't want you to have a country they don't want you to have a strong
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:57.120]  military they don't want you to have a border they don't want you to even exist

[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:37.120]  of the info war and Alex Jones has joined me in studio here in Austin Texas the
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:44.200]  info wars world headquarters tomorrow's news today and what we thought and what
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:48.080]  we reported has now been confirmed Alex they are trying to shut down info wars
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.360]  from getting to President Trump they're trying to shut down media outlets from
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.960]  getting to President Trump they want to control him in the White House and it's
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:00.000]  now being talked about on all different fronts of conservative media and and
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.760]  that's the two issues that I wanted to pop in while you were hosting today and
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:08.680]  doing a great job by the way while I was doing kind of a work occasion taken off
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:13.920]  the radio slash TV transmission to to get some other important irons in the
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:18.240]  fire completed a bunch of the different TV satellites we're connecting to in the
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:23.840]  next couple weeks and a big push to roll out on UHF VHF and cable stations
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:28.320]  around the country to counter the massive censorship we've dealt with online
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:33.440]  because we've always been on talk radio but also online and then dominated
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.240]  online because it was an open free market but now they're coming in and
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:42.200]  that's that's the reason I wanted to pop in was a the whole climate of violence
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:46.880]  being pushed by the left as censorship on the ground and intimidation classic
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:50.320]  racketeering a classic political oppression like you saw in Tiananmen
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:55.080]  Square in 1989 with the tanks coming in to crush the students having a pro free
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:59.720]  speech rally yeah they're the tanks the left is the tanks today they're Tiananmen
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:03.760]  squaring us libertarians conservatives when they attack us spit on us try to
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:07.680]  get our events canceled try to kick us off YouTube Facebook Twitter that's all
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.400]  hardcore super oppression but then they're the ones that are gonna lay in
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:17.760]  front of the tanks that we have a memorial you know a deal parade so that's
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:22.760]  it who here are the two groups of stories today that come together and
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:29.240]  that's the stacks of news here that are on info wars.com every day of leftists
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:34.720]  saying kill conservatives kill Trump kill white people journalists calls for
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.600]  professors to drown conservative students and says to his students go start
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:44.400]  killing people right here bet middler jokes about Rand Paul being violently
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.360]  assaulted where's Rand Paul's neighbor when you need him
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:54.920]  you're representative Charlie Dent popping in and saying oh you know how dare
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:58.560]  you I mean you know no wonder your neighbor attacks you when it broke six
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:01.920]  ribs and could have killed him and we've already had Scalise shot and all this
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:05.440]  stuff and that's a whole nother subject of cover in the next segment the train
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:09.960]  wreck to don't forget about the train wreck all of it Rand Paul's right these
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:13.440]  deficits are gonna kill us Rand Paul's right that Trump is somebody that
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:17.920]  understands in a world of total debt the Chinese everybody else are inflating
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:22.640]  debt wise to militarily economically take over we've been artificially shut
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:27.880]  down all we've got to blast out now is bubbles so Trump is right that if you're
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:32.720]  gonna live in a world of debt use it leverage it be the biggest edit that's
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:35.360]  what a lot of these rich people do it's what the globalist do he's actually
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:38.200]  trying to give America that trick that they've been using for themselves not
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:42.920]  for us I'm not saying it's perfect but Rand Paul if he did what he wanted we
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:45.680]  go into total depression and some say well that'll teach people not to be so
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:50.040]  lazy it's the way to go both men are right it's two different schools but you
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:53.760]  do not sit there and well how can both be right both are right from their
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:57.280]  perspective in two different mindsets for the world we're in I think Trump
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:02.120]  bottom line is more strategic and understands what he's doing and I'm not
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:06.200]  saying that Paul isn't smart he's obviously just very idealistic which I
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:11.480]  support we needed that voice to be in there giving a speech saying hey we
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:16.000]  promise to not do this once we became a majority we ran on this and we're lying
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.240]  well well Trump didn't run on that and Paul points out he said no everybody
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.960]  else is inflating all this debt just get used to it and learn how to use it and
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.320]  control it because it's you know never coming back basically there's a total
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.960]  worldwide collapse and you really want to punch that button today if he was a
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:32.480]  globalist I'd say go ahead and punch it because I want to bring them down but
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:36.360]  we're trying to reboot the country in the middle of this emergency I I agree
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:39.200]  what the president's doing because we're already so far gone debt wise it's
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:42.960]  already so ridiculous we should teach people the tricks the globalist tab on
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.920]  this whole debt situation to use it against them but that's a whole other
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.480]  subject next segment I gotta get to this right now because we got Matt Bracken
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:52.600]  coming up so you've got all these people saying yeah I'd like to attack
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:55.040]  Rand Paul yeah that's great let's you know too bad he didn't get you know
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:59.520]  totally taken out with all these other statements going on so that's the
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.520]  intimidation on the street that's the that's the tanks at Tiananmen Square
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:05.760]  that's the bike lock upside your head that's the guy spitting on yes my
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:11.040]  dump and coffee on me AK's out on the streets saying you're not allowed to go
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.480]  to a rally and the police say well it's just how it is we're a blue city
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:19.920]  SBU running the info war story a milly weaver depicted getting raped by a
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:27.240]  leftist and the jury in the law and order show says won't know you're
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:30.240]  gonna rape you you're conservative we're allowed to rape you and the jury
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:34.320]  lets them go it's a message go out start raping so that's who these people are
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:39.040]  that that mixes into this other big story dealing with the communications
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:43.080]  director from the White House being in trouble for reportedly family violence
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:48.200]  maybe true may not probably is who knows the point is is this is the guy they
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:51.120]  now admit and we had the documents before it's been proven our sources
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.960]  quarterbacking the shutdown of info wars and Breitbart news and other just
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:59.520]  alternative news to the president and I just thought it was interesting that
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.840]  limbaugh came out and talked about the chef's day in a positive way towards
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:07.880]  there being competition because the next story when we come back from break is
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:13.120]  the CEO of news core admits they want to shut down everybody's independent
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:17.760]  website everybody's independent web just like everybody always warned about
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:21.680]  getting rid of that neutrality but it's news core and others when you get to
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:25.360]  put together with the newspapers and with Facebook Twitter and all the rest of
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:30.760]  them and making them come and censor us so that's the perfect storm going we've
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:35.240]  got Facebook Twitter Google already censoring selectively libertarians
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.560]  conservatives and others but the real move is going to be everybody with the
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:42.520]  corporations once the president's been said news core CEO admits he wants
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:47.200]  internet censorship so news core can make more money the potential returns for
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:52.320]  journalism would be far higher always warned of the perfect storm of mainstream
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.520]  media collapsing because of choice diversity and competition and the
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.760]  globalist and the democrats being rejected and collectivism being rejected
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:05.200]  at that critical point government and the big corporations on the left would
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:09.160]  come together to screw over the first amendment screw everybody now we had
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:13.320]  real net neutrality before Obama's do net neutrality was federalizing it and
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:16.200]  shutting down conservative speech that was actually in the bill that they
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:19.920]  allow billy protection the new thing that they're now coming in with is
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.200]  another form of that but with select corporations controlling it and
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:26.600]  basically using regulation to force Facebook Twitter and others to only
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:30.600]  feed you their information so it's like a five armies war here where they're all
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:35.320]  battling over who gets control of free speech and then confusing all their
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:40.160]  constituents when all three plans are evil and are bad and are basically the
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:43.280]  same thing just by different factions and then there's rush limbaugh and there's
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:47.040]  Matt drudge and there's info wars and and just it's great how we're not in
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.640]  competition with each other because we understand it is about everybody's free
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:54.120]  speech and I want it to be on record it's rush limbaugh and it's Matt drudge
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:58.080]  and it's Alex Jones and info wars and we're the ones saying let leftists have
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:01.120]  their free speech let drudge have their free speech with the wall street journal
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:06.120]  habit let news core let CNN don't shut us down but notice the perfect storm
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:10.720]  particularly by news core is they want info wars and drudging things blocked and
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:15.560]  that's what Rupert Murdoch's trying to push to Trump but but but not telling him
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:19.520]  oh sir we're gonna shut conservatives down no no thanks sir this is really the
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:24.600]  open free market and confusing him he's a smart guy on a lot of things but he's
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:28.840]  71 years old admits he's not a big tech guy we got to get those messages and I
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.800]  know drudge can and others can to the president and explain all that it's
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:36.320]  keys when we come back I'm gonna play this clip of limbaugh talking about how
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:40.200]  info wars is being shut down and blocked to the president while at the same time
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.760]  Google Facebook Twitter are trying to block it while at the same time
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:46.760]  Democrats put all these TV shows out where I'm a Nazi I'm a criminal or my
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:51.480]  reporters deserve to get raped I mean this is full spectrum attack on info
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.800]  wars you've got to ask yourselves why that's the key to bringing the whole

[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:54.760]  know we know who they are and they're coming back against us so we need your
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:33:06.240]  support you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:34.760]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones Alex they're able to
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:39.160]  get away with all the censorship of us because it happens on a digital platform
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:43.600]  so we can't see it we don't know the algorithms we just have to report on it
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:47.320]  as we see it and then take their words and say look they're the anti-free
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:53.240]  speech side well and let's be clear we have the Veritas undercover videos we
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:57.160]  have lawsuit documents we have executives at Google that said listen we're
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:01.640]  called into sports stadium areas amplitheaters and seat thousands and we
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:05.640]  all say you are a golden dragon at you are an ornate building it's total cult
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:11.360]  brainwashing and that's what this is all about is getting people to do whatever
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:14.720]  you say whenever you want and then they go out and have the people at Google
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:18.960]  Facebook and Twitter censoring us and just shadow banning and blocking
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:22.880]  everybody and then you get the internal documents it's anything with an
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:27.120]  American flag is not allowed to be shared ha ha ha the dumb idiots don't know
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:31.560]  it's secretly banned I mean these are quotes and videos okay so this is the
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:34.800]  Veritas and others that's why I've been waiting on the lawsuits is because I've
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:39.360]  been I've been named in lawsuits against them and I can join those now
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.400]  we're in talks with some of the groups I've met with the lawyers I've been to
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:46.440]  DC I've been to Seattle going back to DC soon a couple weeks to work on this to
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:49.720]  do the perfect cases to defend the free speech we don't care about trying to get
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:54.520]  money to me long hard battle but we have been chosen the shortest straw the
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:58.640]  shortest straw goes to you you have pulled the shortest straw so understand
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:06.960]  info wars is now what they've chosen to destroy at least nine or ten TV shows a
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:11.360]  week saying we are Alex Jones we are info wars we are their reporters with
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:15.760]  characters for our reporters being killed being raped being attacked jury say in
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:19.840]  the shows we're allowed to rape we're allowed to kill they go this is an Alex
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:23.600]  Jones character and he says he loves Hitler and then and then kills the
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:27.400]  female president and then now in the new season of Homeland he works for the
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:30.760]  new president that's Trump I mean it and then people watch this they watch
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:35.120]  Showtime and the show used to be about Islamic terrorists or whatever well
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.960]  that's too politically correct now it's me and people go oh well that's an only
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:43.440]  idiots believe that well when they see on the street and want to kill you so
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:47.600]  clearly it's what a lot of experts have said is it is an attempt to physically
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:51.900]  intimidate everybody and then they think well Jones is kind of out there and his
[01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:56.240]  info is effective but we can discredit that we can get everybody as the litmus
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:02.640]  test and limbaugh and Matt Drudge and and Michael Savage only a few others get
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:07.720]  that now when I saw Kelly ban in full wars and ban everything else and that
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:11.480]  was admitted and we're gonna extend Matt Bracken the next hour so plenty of
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:16.120]  times I want to talk to him as well when all that happened when I saw Trump's
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:19.520]  policies kind of continue on being good mainly I said okay I'm not gonna get to
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:24.720]  fight about Kelly I dropped it but now we learn his chief guy the head of
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:28.960]  communications who reportedly said have to step down for a reported domestic
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:34.080]  violence or abuse is the main quarterback that was in there watching
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:37.840]  and policing and that's come out in the news and again we broke that Mike
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:41.560]  certain it was broke that months ago and it's been confirmed I've talked to people
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:44.520]  in the White House we have folks that go back and forth and get them
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:49.000]  information it's then written into memos and then they can always find a
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.200]  mainstream source of what I'm covering cuz contrary to mainline news I'm telling
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:55.680]  the truth we just give more analysis and then they get back to the president and
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:00.840]  and they know that there they have full teams of people keeping the people Trump
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.960]  hired from being able to give him information and of course Trump here is
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:07.600]  he's not supposed to get info wars well then that is really what he wants to go
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:12.880]  for show here's the story Limbaugh info wars articles withheld from Trump by
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:18.800]  departed White House aid Porter here's another one news core CEO admits he wants
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:23.600]  internet censorship so news core can make more money and all of it says oh
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:27.720]  it's a dysfunctional online environment so because it's not profitable from them
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:32.560]  because people don't like them people are tuning out he wants to make all the
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:37.080]  big internet platforms not allow any type of alternative news and I told you
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:41.360]  this as soon as they can get me shut down I've only got like five billion six
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:45.400]  million views on YouTube poody pies up to like 20 billion now he's number one
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:50.480]  okay he's just a funny libertarian guy who didn't get political they started
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:54.120]  trying to take him over demonetized him and said you work for us now we'll let
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:57.640]  you have your 40 million a year whatever the guy makes so he's very successful
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:01.680]  he bucked them and now is getting more hardcore see the attempt to shut him up
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:05.160]  the attempt to take him under their control they don't want anybody that's
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:08.880]  talented anybody that has an organic giant audience Oprah Winfrey never had
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:14.760]  20 billion views I see so see they don't know what to do and it's classy that
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:19.680]  limbaugh and others understand that that if we don't stand up for free speech
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.800]  for everybody we're all gonna lose it and it's that simple so here's a clip of
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:27.840]  Russian limbaugh and then we're gonna get your take and Matt Bracken's take on
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:32.040]  what the next attacks gonna be because the deep state's losing and all the
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:35.000]  things that we're looking at on the radar a former Navy SEAL best-selling
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.200]  author counterterrorism specialist Matt Bracken coming up just a moment again
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:40.960]  Alex Jones you're just popping in with a lot Owen's house today but so much
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:45.120]  emergency news while we're here working I decided to pop in as well so let's go
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:49.760]  ahead and go to Russian Limbaugh yesterday he's 40 years old he's been
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:53.000]  credited with working with the chief of staff to control the flow of
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.160]  information to the president and what that means that what what that means is
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:03.760]  that Trump gets less Breitbart and less info wars and more political and more
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:09.560]  mainstream news it used to be apparent according to what we've been told the
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:14.920]  Oval Office door was open and you could walk in with anything you found anywhere
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:19.640]  on the internet and give it to Trump and he'd take it for what it was and react
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:24.120]  to it but the new chief of staff put limits on who a was able to get in
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:29.520]  there is one of the reason Omarosa supposedly left is because her access was
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:36.400]  denied but again this is already known people like oh Limbaugh is talking about
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:45.160]  it the issue here is that they only want democratic sources the president
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:47.720]  that's not really true what Limbaugh said that the president just takes it at
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:50.680]  face value that's not true he's really knowledgeable about stuff he checks
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:54.000]  things he goes online itself he gets whole stacks of news he looks at
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  everything okay and if you see one of our articles about three plus million
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.800]  illegals voting he knows that's already true and it turns out it's seven million
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:06.400]  when Harvard looks at it so this whole idea but the point is at least they're
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:10.040]  admitting that we've been targeted so I asked Matt Bracken before we go to break
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:12.760]  and he comes back and it's one of the latest threats and what he thinks the
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:15.920]  next shoe to drop is gonna be because he's been accurately predicting it so far
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:18.920]  and what's happened with Amtrak he said about a year ago and he six months ago
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.600]  look for Amtrak to get hit now he's seen record amounts of that a lot of
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.800]  shabiness that's all coming up next segment and then after that I'll let
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:28.400]  Owen take back over doing a fabulous job but but Matt what do you make of them
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:35.440]  choosing info wars as the case point for destruction and and and do people get
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:39.640]  that if they can do that to us they're going to do it to everybody I think that
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:43.400]  I think it's a mistake on their part of a kind of a strategic mistake on their
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:47.800]  part because of this the Streisand effect you know the more you say don't
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:51.480]  look at something the more people want to look at it you mentioned it with
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:57.480]  PewDiePie I just heard today rush was talking about it more than 50% of
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:02.840]  Americans think that the FBI spied on Trump and won a special counsel the
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:06.320]  Washington Post and the rest of American Providence freaking out about this
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:10.720]  because they've been boycotting this news you know they've either been you know
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:14.720]  of course they've been talking about you know Trump Russia collusion for two
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:19.920]  years on the illegal spying is all public totally confirmed right and as the
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:24.920]  more that they try to embargo it they now sound like Soviet Union Provedo you
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:29.400]  know saying like I do not look at imperialist radio you know free Europe
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:33.440]  don't don't listen to the voice of America that just makes people want to
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:38.960]  sneak up into their attic and listen to it more when the when the organs of the
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:44.320]  state propaganda are saying be a good comrade don't listen to subversive
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:48.600]  infowars well the next thing that people tune into is going to be infowars
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:53.720]  even if they never heard it before anything that big brother hates must be
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:59.760]  something people should listen to and just like in the 50 60 70s and 80s they
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:04.600]  would jam the shortwave and am transmissions out of Europe into Russia
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:08.360]  they would jam it and they're jamming us today just high-tech censorship online
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:14.320]  right this is why O'Keeffe he calls it American Provedo James O'Keeffe it's
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:18.560]  it's got him it's a hydroheaded Provedo it's not just you know one state
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:21.800]  government but it might as well be because they're all working from the
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:26.600]  same playbook I have a new meme that I made called the Izzy for Michael Izikoff
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:33.880]  he he obviously cooperated with the FBI with steel to to be the parallel course
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:39.360]  to get this into the mainstream media the fact that this dossier this the false
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:45.760]  information was out there we now have fake Provedo Soviet style media working
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:52.200]  hand-in-glove you know with the corrupt seven floor of the FBI let's come back

[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:48.400]  you jump at any time here while you're co-hosting back to you Matt Bracken
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:53.240]  you've always got so much on your radar that is next year's news today with your
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:57.400]  analysis as a counterterrorism former counterterrorism specialist and the
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:02.520]  Navy seal and best-selling author what what is the current thing on your big
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:07.880]  radar screen well that the trains are obviously very vulnerable they're so
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:12.240]  vulnerable that I don't even want to describe how vulnerable you know they
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:16.880]  are to monkey-wrench type of tax to put two trains on one track is something
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:21.440]  that you know anybody can do unfortunately you know trains were
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:26.200]  built during a time when society was assumed that the people wouldn't want
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:30.320]  to derail trains now we can't make that assumption and all those tracks are just
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:34.760]  you're laying out there exposed to monkey-wrench attack but the bigger
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:39.840]  threat I think is is either another James Hodgson he was the baseball practice
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:45.800]  shooter you know the media 24 hours a day is comparing Trump to Hitler and you
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:51.400]  know it's the the psychology 101 kind of thought experiment you know if you know
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:55.680]  you've got a Hitler isn't it the moral thing to kill him you know from people
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:59.520]  like Betten Mittler all the time laying out huge articles about here they are
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:04.920]  there's not a lot of security here they are right or or you know even for
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:09.560]  example Rand Paul's neighbor there's a layer of a level of anger that's being
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:14.400]  built the country is sort of splitting apart you know this stricestand effect
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:20.240]  works for us in that the American province can't shut us off but their
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:25.680]  their fanatics are being whipped to a greater and greater frenzy yeah so but
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:30.680]  very Balkanized like Lebanon so I would expect to see more James Hodgson's my
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:36.360]  bigger my bigger fear though is a false flag attack specifically Las Vegas style
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:42.600]  sniper attack but with a better you know plan to leave you know false clues that
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:46.880]  it was done by the right wing this has been seen throughout history I mean in
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:51.560]  the Balkans we saw in the Bosnia war we saw you know mortar attacks own goal
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:56.440]  mortar attacks that were successfully used we've seen that also with the white
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:53:02.240]  helmets in you know in Syria own goal false with false flag attacks knowing
[01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:06.520]  that the media will play the false narrative completely straight and it's
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:10.640]  effective I mean it works false flags are done because they work and now we've
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:17.080]  got Pelosi and we've got other operatives who are known intelligence
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:21.040]  operatives of deep state going on MSNBC and saying you're going to cause a
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:25.440]  massacre with these memos you're going to cause a new Oklahoma City and you've
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:29.280]  got all these other globalists saying that they're signaling so they can go
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:33.480]  oh look see we told you so well and the reason why the boycott of the news
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:37.680]  stories that Matt was talking about earlier is so key is because they put
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:41.840]  these people in a bubble and so if Alex Jones or I go up to them say hey did you
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:46.440]  hear about the memo that actually shows the Obama DOJ and FBI colluding with
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:50.280]  Hillary Clinton to let her get away with crimes they say oh you're fake news you
[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:53.680]  just made that up because of the media boycott where they don't even tell you
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:58.280]  might Michael Isaacov was the guy that spiked the Monica Lewinsky story to
[01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:02.920]  protect Hillary and Bill Clinton it's the same culprit it's the same guys here
[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:06.600]  they are 20 years later in the media in the Justice Department the FBI and the
[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:09.760]  whole deal are the stay-behind networks of the Clinton crime network and it's a
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:13.120]  very small group of like a hundred people that have been doing it since 1993
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:17.240]  what do we do Matt Bracken well I think that you know Watergate style this is
[01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:20.560]  all coming out only it'll be you know a hundred times bigger than Watergate this
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:28.200]  is the entire FBI DOJ top echelon of CIA under Brennan you know there's some
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:32.840]  some white hats like Michael Admiral Mike Rogers at NSA that have kept us from
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:38.320]  completely going down the course but I think that the deep state traders they
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:43.120]  they see that that their ship is sinking the kind of one the Titanic and they
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:46.880]  need to they want to get on a lifeboat so I think that the the risk is much
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:51.920]  greater for a massive Oklahoma City style false flag or or I'm not saying
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:55.320]  that Oklahoma City was necessarily false flag but there will be either or
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.840]  something on a level of an Oklahoma City or a Las Vegas shooting where the
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:05.600]  literature will be left at the scene you know I hate the you know I hate the left
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:09.920]  kind of literature for example against the woman's March or a black lives
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:15.000]  March about Black Lives Matter March with you know Nazi KKK bright Bart
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:20.200]  Info Wars clues left there but this won't work necessarily because it will
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:25.000]  while it will split the left further to the left the right will see it as a
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:30.720]  bogus story and not believe it at all so if something like this happens it just
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:35.320]  ratchets us that much closer to an out-and-out you know civil war which
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:40.840]  will be a war like in Argentina in the 70s you know with with disappearances
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:48.080]  bombings assassinations kidnappings secret to torque detention centers this
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:53.400]  is the type of thing that we're heading toward what you just said my bracket
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:57.760]  is is is our emergency transmission it's the Paul Revere message that
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:04.120]  historically if you as you just said if you profile other scenarios like this
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:09.080]  here in other places they're going for broke they've committed so many crimes
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:13.520]  that they will do anything if they could get their hands on a tactical nuke
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:16.280]  and you know they set it off at the Republican retreat I don't think Trump
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:20.040]  should be anywhere with the Republican leadership alone because the Democrats
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:23.120]  have already said we want authoritarianism we want the press shut down we
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:26.760]  want everybody arrested tens of thousands of patriot leaders they know
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:30.480]  they've been rejected by America so they're they've said they're going all
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:34.320]  out authoritarian and Rob Reiner just called for a civil war he did call for
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:38.840]  he said this is the last battle of the Civil War yeah well if you if you fuck if you use if you use
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:47.880]  Comey kind of as a as a litmus test or you know a marker when when the attempt
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:53.000]  to to get Hillary elected by leaking first protecting her against the email
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.880]  scandals you know the secret top secret information scandals and then creating
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:03.280]  the false dossier against Trump once Trump was elected if they thought that
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:06.720]  they were you know that this the game was over they would have like started
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:11.200]  burning their top secret message totally committed to get him out and to
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:16.800]  stop us and to have new stage elections we've got their whole blueprint a new
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:23.000]  president so yeah it's there they are going for broke and Comey's writing a
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.520]  book where he's not he's unrepentant they look at it as we're the resistance to
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:32.400]  Hitler and if we have to use tricks and subterfuge to get rid of Trump Hitler
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:36.280]  all is fair in love and we're coming back at 70 seconds then one more point
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.440]  I want to make about that article we had earlier in the week about homeland where
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:43.600]  we're right what the new homeland the CIN FBI are stay behind networks fighting
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:48.760]  Trump to overthrow it they've even got propaganda info wars wife is bringing
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:53.000]  you a breakthrough in modern medicine we have found extraordinary new natural

[02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:22.120]  really actually predicted much what was coming Rob Reiner and other top
[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:26.720]  Democrats are now admitting that America is in a civil war they've had
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:29.480]  hundreds and hundreds of articles making fun of me in the last few years
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:33.240]  saying that they're engineering a civil war even while behind the scenes
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:37.040]  anti-fun others and the big universities are gearing up for this then they
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:40.520]  promote total racial division they weaponize that that's in the WikiLeaks
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:46.400]  as well and say we don't have total open borders under the UN and pay slave
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:51.680]  reparations all the other crazy stuff that well we're a racist Nazi nation
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:56.240]  that must be overthrown so they're the outside of globalist forces using
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:00.560]  third world populations as pawns to try to break the country down and it's
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:06.440]  really amazing so here's a clip of mr. Reiner just last night at one of the
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:12.160]  minority award shows sitting there invoking all this racial garbage when
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:16.960]  they're the ones totally by design in their own WikiLeaks trying to create
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:22.040]  racial division it's so transparent he's such a slime bag from that evil wicked
[02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:29.600]  festering scruffulous rotting hole that is Hollywood here it is but then he
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:34.200]  gets into office and there are good people on both sides in Charlottesville
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:41.280]  and there are people coming from countries and it goes on and on and you
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:48.120]  see the people that he hires that are in his administration and we see that this
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:56.240]  now becomes the last battle of the civil war and we're fighting it right now and
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:02.600]  we're gonna win we're gonna win but we thought we were on this slide path we've
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:08.480]  been dragged back and we're going to win because if we don't win the promise of
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:13.840]  what this country started as which is we are all one we are all created equal
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:22.000]  that promise will not be realized unless we can overcome what has happened in
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:27.680]  this last election and I know we will I was reading article info wars dot com
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:32.480]  about this black awards group and it's come out the news you pay for the award
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:36.680]  so rob rhiner always let us are so bizarre and so weird there's aren't
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:41.760]  any real black people in their life they they just go to award shows and pay to
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:45.640]  get an award and then tell everybody else how bad they are and just like Matt
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:48.680]  Rackham was just saying earlier they then scripted where we're all the bad
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:52.400]  guys we're all the evil people and they're the angels it's all Hollywood
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:57.320]  scripting and they pay so the stage and everything is just another part of
[02:02:57.320 --> 02:03:01.160]  ebra bernay's psychological warfare that they're the good people we're the bad
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:05.360]  people and it's totally sickening I'm gonna have you guys go ahead and take
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:10.840]  over now but it is simply incredible to know that they are trying to start a
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:15.080]  violent revolution and everybody should be very very vigilant right now you
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:17.680]  guys are coming back in the next segment to get into detail but what
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:22.600]  else is coming up Matt Rackham well this is this is a civil war we just
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:26.240]  haven't broken out into the open shooting phase yet but people like Rob
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:30.560]  Reiner that live behind high walls you know in mansions with bodyguards they
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:34.000]  think that they're untouchable if there's a real civil war I mean they
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:37.480]  should be the last people that would want it because nobody's going to be out
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:42.920]  of range nobody yeah and I doubt that his personal security is going to want to
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:45.960]  protect him at that point they'll be interested in protecting themselves
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:49.680]  there's Rob Reiner trying to squeeze out of a limo you got to be kidding it's
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:53.120]  gonna be the opposite almost all the security people hate them well and you
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:56.720]  notice though in that in that's that little those remarks that he delivers
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:01.240]  how he doesn't provide any detail he says oh Trump makes comments like s-hole
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:05.600]  countries and it's all the people he hired there's no detail he just says
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:09.600]  these things and then the brainwash man just like yeah he hates every Mexican he
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:14.440]  says every Mexican is a criminal yeah he never said that but yeah yeah and it's
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:18.120]  like wait a second we're the one where the Patriots fighting for America this
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:23.300]  is a meathead meathead from Archie Bunker he's the guy that had Morgan
[02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:26.800]  Freeman do that thing about Russia took over we're in war with Russia this is
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:30.480]  insane asylum crap all right Matt Bracken I would show you guys are taking
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:34.120]  over the Dr. Corsi about 15 minutes with big breaking news it's all on news
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:38.400]  wars.com info wars.com and I will continue to be here working behind the
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:43.480]  scenes as Owen transmits big things happening a lot of stuff going on and
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:47.600]  every time they cut off a couple of our heads we just grow a couple more thank
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:50.640]  you all for your support you are making it all possible but number one we need
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:54.480]  your prayers thank you all we'll be back

[02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:07.520]  efficiency and protection mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy they are
[02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:12.240]  your body's cellular engines cell force helps promote your cellular energy
[02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:16.520]  production by supporting mitochondria much like a cellular engine overhaul
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:21.200]  because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency then they start
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:26.240]  producing reactive oxygen species top scientists agree that aging is most
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:30.560]  likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen

[02:05:57.760 --> 02:06:14.280]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:20.000]  Alex Jones departs but he is about to about to go file some special reports
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:24.640]  right now so be on the lookout for those special reports from Alex it's just so
[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:27.800]  ridiculous they call and they say Russian collusion if they understood how
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:31.160]  much work is actually done around here you realize we don't have any time for
[02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:34.000]  Russian collusion but we're about to go back to Matt Bracken but I want to play
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:39.600]  this clip one more time because it really tells the story they are violent
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:43.480]  they want war it's not gonna be Rob Reiner fighting the Civil War it's not
[02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:46.840]  gonna be you know the television hosts and the Colbeirs they're not gonna be
[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:49.600]  fighting anything they're not gonna pick up a weapon they're not gonna have a
[02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:54.320]  callus on their hand they want their brainwashed minions in the Antifa groups
[02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:57.520]  see do you I wish that Antifa would understand this I wish that these
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:07:01.840]  anti-trumpers would understand this you're being used as pawns you are
[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:06.840]  being used as collateral damage you are being used by these people so here's
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:10.760]  Rob Reiner talking about fighting a civil war that he'll never fight in but
[02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:14.200]  he wants the liberal minions on the streets to actually die for here's Rob
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:19.780]  Reiner then he gets into office and there are good people on both sides in
[02:07:19.780 --> 02:07:25.480]  Charlottesville and there are people coming from countries and never said
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:30.400]  that goes on and on and you see that what goes on and on hires that are in his
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:38.680]  administration and we see that this now becomes the last battle of the Civil War
[02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:43.880]  mmm and we're fighting it right are you fighting it Rob and we're gonna win
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:49.240]  we're gonna win but oh are you we thought you're losing slide path we've been
[02:07:49.240 --> 02:07:53.680]  dragged back and we're going yeah yeah we thought we're on this path to destroy
[02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:58.800]  America and Trump's saving America I mean this is crazy is we are all one we
[02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:05.920]  are all created equal that promise will not be realized so so unless we can
[02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:11.680]  overcome what has happened in this last election just think about how think
[02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:16.560]  about this is 1984 because here he is saying we were on this great path of
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:20.760]  destroying America killing the economy killing the infrastructure increasing the
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:24.640]  welfare state bringing in the third world countries destroying everything we
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:29.160]  were on that path and then here comes Trump and he's bringing America back and
[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:33.600]  patriots are back and America's back but we're gonna stop that and then we're
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:37.760]  gonna pretend like he's killing America even though we were just bragging about
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:41.760]  killing America and he's gonna save America I mean Matt Bracken do these
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:46.280]  protesters understand that they are literally just essentially bodies for
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:49.680]  the left there are just collateral damage for the left in the streets yeah
[02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:52.920]  they would love to sacrifice all these members of Antifa to blame the Patriots
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:56.680]  for violence that's what they want
[02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:02.400]  would that would be in the Rob Reiner leg you know the Betten Mittler leg they
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:06.440]  have the they have the microphone and the camera so they can put out their
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:10.480]  propaganda points they're really speaking to the James Hodgkessons and
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:14.480]  saying you know go buy an SKS and massacre some Republicans that's what
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:19.320]  they're saying but you know the problem the greater problem that I see is that
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:23.840]  in this civil war you know the federal government all together I think there's
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:29.720]  a couple hundred thousand badged armed federal officers and that's nothing
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:34.360]  compared to the number of Americans with military training you know that have
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:39.920]  the basic you know the basic 400 yard deer rifle there's no way to put
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:44.760]  security cordons around all of these guys whether they're senior executive
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:50.200]  service those are the civilian generals that run the deep state the SES there's
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:54.720]  no way only a few people at the cabinet level the presidential level get
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:59.800]  rifle range security you know the security that you see around somebody
[02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:04.440]  you know minor functionaries that's close range that's against like a pistol
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:09.040]  attack a grenade attack but there's no way to protect them protect all these
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:14.200]  guys or on our side from rifle attacks but the thing about it is though our
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:19.360]  side has the rifles and the experience these Antifa guys they're posing with
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:24.560]  you know with the paintball gun or pellet they're wearing chicken costumes
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:29.120]  Matt right yeah they're the Antifa guys aren't serious now they can monkey
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:33.440]  rent rents or a railroad track probably they can do that and they go can they
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:37.360]  even do that yeah I think that there are some that can you know they've put
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:42.560]  cement over the tracks out in Seattle things like that and it's not much it's
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:48.240]  really no harder to actually change the switches on a track to cause mayhem but
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:52.360]  you know I think that that these guys like Reiner that really do live in a
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:55.960]  bubble because they live like like Joe Kennedy they live in mansions behind
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:11:00.960]  walls and in their in their mind America was on a glide path to this
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:06.680]  socialist utopia you know that Obama was trying to bring in but those of us with
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:12.080]  rational minds we can see two or three steps down the track beyond their
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:17.400]  socialist utopia is Venezuela and Cuba you know they they think that they're
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:21.600]  going to somehow invent the first socialist utopia in America that didn't
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:25.640]  turn out to be Venezuela or Cuba but those of us that have fought actually
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:30.000]  fought for freedom we know where it's going and before we let them take
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.060]  complete power there will be a civil war the problem is that when you turn on
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:41.240]  TV and you watch good guys like Sean Hannity they say 99.9% of the FBI are
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:47.600]  great guys I wish that that was true I really do and maybe it used to be but
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:51.880]  when you consider that for at least 10 years they've been hiring social justice
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:56.680]  warriors when they take their their oath to defend the Constitution it's it's like
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:01.160]  a wink-wink they consider the Constitution to be a massive obstacle to
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:07.040]  them these are guys that swore to uphold the Constitution they think it's a joke
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:12.920]  that's Comey clapper Brennan communist probable Muslim Brennan they've been
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:18.560]  hiring people a story that I think never got enough attention was the the almost
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:24.920]  terrorist attack in Garland Texas against Gert Wilders Pam Geller and and
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:31.080]  Robert Robert Robert Spencer of jihad watch the FBI agent was in the car
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:37.920]  behind the terrorists telling them to tear up Texas Geller and Spencer they
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:41.600]  have a lawsuit against the FBI of course it'll go nowhere unless it's well
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:45.280]  remember the FBI has to sometimes the FBI has to you know stage things to keep
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:50.600]  themselves relevant right and I think that at Oklahoma City for example I'm
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:53.840]  not saying that they had direct foreknowledge but they certainly were
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:13:00.200]  nested into the the crazies that were the that McVay sprang out of the FBI had
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:06.320]  informants all through that and it's not a it's not to say the FBI planned and
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:11.360]  carried out this or that terrorist attack but when they know it's going to
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:17.920]  happen I think that sometimes they stand back and let it happen and if anybody
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:23.600]  doubts me just look up what happened in Garland Texas I'm not talking about an
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:30.480]  informant I'm talking about a gold badge FBI special agent is in the car behind
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:35.440]  the terrorists he followed them from Arizona to Texas telling texting them
[02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:40.640]  tear up Texas yeah and wasn't there a similar story with someone who tried to
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:44.680]  bomb the World Trade Center too where they bring in a suitcase bomb and it was
[02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:49.960]  a total setup and the FBI was privy to the whole thing well sometimes they do
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:53.920]  that with inert with inert explosives to make a better case that they get the guy
[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:58.080]  to the point where he's actually pushing the button but it's an inert it's an
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:03.080]  inert device but the problem is sometimes they lead these guys toward that
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:07.640]  inert device fake you know the fake control delivery but then the guy gets
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:12.600]  off their radar and then he tell them it's fake and it's a real bomb I think
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:15.680]  that's what happened in the World Trade Center was in the 90s guys if Steve you
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:21.680]  can find that story yeah I wish I wish that I could say that that 90 percent or
[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:25.440]  99 percent of the FBI were all these you know stellar defenders of the
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:29.080]  Constitution but when you see who they've been hiring you look at fast
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:35.600]  and furious hundreds of Mexicans killed on purpose you know to to slime our
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:40.480]  Second Amendment and slime our gun stores it was done on purpose nobody was
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:44.960]  ever held to account holder got contempt of contempt of Congress but no
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:49.920]  sanctions he's out there making millions of dollars you know as these bogus
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:55.280]  law firms so yeah nobody's held to account Comey's got a two million dollar
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:15:00.760]  book deal yeah he's a traitor he's an oath breaker he thinks that that he
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:07.280]  perjured himself I'm sorry he perjured himself constantly and what will there
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:10.880]  be any retribution against these guys will there will there be any legal
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:15.360]  consequences you know a lot of America is wondering but when a poll comes out
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:22.080]  that says more than 50% of Americans already and believe that the FBI did
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:27.480]  this dossier setup against Trump and this is with the entire mainstream media
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:31.720]  my god telling the exact opposite story and that shows you that shows you how
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:36.080]  corrupted is because if the FBI really wanted to save itself all you have to do
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:40.880]  is lock up Hillary that's all you have to do if they would just lock Hillary up
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:43.960]  people would finally say something positive about the FBI but they won't

[02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:41.840]  alex momentarily he is doing some special reports right now so be sure to
[02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:47.480]  check that out on the alex jones channel on YouTube when I'm now joined by one of
[02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:52.120]  our great reporters at info wars dot com doctor dr. Jerry Corsi he's got a
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:57.840]  couple big stories right now on info wars dot com bombshell DOJ FBI continued
[02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:02.560]  to spy on Trump in White House that was published yesterday and then two days
[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:08.000]  ago he published report evidence exists to charge shift with treason but let's
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:14.480]  first go dr. Corsi to the bombshell that comes out with the Grassley memo the
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:18.640]  FBI and the DOJ continuing to spy on Trump so we know about everything they
[02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:22.320]  did to make up the fake dossier that didn't basically allow Hillary Clinton
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:26.800]  to buy a spy warrant on the president Trump but you're now saying that with
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:30.320]  this newly released memo we have the evidence that they continued to spy on
[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:35.600]  Trump even after the election oh that's correct I mean the if you take a look at
[02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:39.440]  the grassley letter and the grassy letter was pretty shocking we get down
[02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:46.360]  in the details because what it said was the extensions on the faiza court of
[02:21:46.360 --> 02:21:52.960]  electronic surveillance approval extended through June 2017 now that means
[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:57.760]  six months into the Trump administration when Trump's in the White
[02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:03.280]  House so from all indications given the nature of the grassley letter and I
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:09.760]  confirmed it also we have the a 99 page report that was given out by the faiza
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:15.320]  court itself really reprimanding the Obama administration for not limiting
[02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:20.280]  the number of people who were caught in this net to a very few but broadening it
[02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:25.760]  out is a very scathing attack on the way the Department of Justice and FBI have
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:31.200]  been working with the faiza court of the faiza court event 99 page order also
[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:35.400]  indicated that the electronic surveillance that continued all the way
[02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:42.560]  into the White House which is pretty shocking I mean you have that FBI
[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:48.760]  dominated by opposition people packed with the people from the Obama
[02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:55.880]  administration who are now utilizing this expanded faiza power to wiretap on a
[02:22:55.880 --> 02:23:01.960]  sitting president well and now we have yeah yeah and now we have the call for
[02:23:01.960 --> 02:23:05.360]  Christopher Steele to be investigated well absolutely if you want to look for
[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:10.640]  Russian collusion why isn't why isn't Mueller banging down Christopher Steele's
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:15.800]  door to find out who his Russian sources wore for the dossier that allowed
[02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:20.480]  Hillary Clinton to spy on Trump's campaign but but but really here I mean
[02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:24.480]  honestly there's so many different angles to this story Dr. Corsi and one of
[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:28.800]  them that it kind of just gets caught up in the fog it's like not seeing the
[02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:33.040]  force through the trees or however the the saying goes beyond the corruption of
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:36.080]  Hillary Clinton beyond the corruption of Obama beyond the corruption of the FBI
[02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:41.640]  the DOJ which is undoubted undeniable we've got him caught red-handed but but
[02:23:41.640 --> 02:23:48.760]  the blatant abuse of the faiza court the blatant abuse of privacy it's like they
[02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:53.160]  don't even care oh yeah we got in we made it all up and now we're spying on
[02:23:53.160 --> 02:23:56.920]  Trump well we're supposed to be spying on you know maybe Carter Page here and
[02:23:56.920 --> 02:24:00.200]  maybe Paul Manafort here something maybe Roger Stone over here no no no they
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:05.160]  spied on everyone they were looking at everything they were paying attention to
[02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:10.120]  everyone I mean this is this not the greatest abuse I mean the honestly this
[02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:14.640]  is so bad and I know you've alluded to this before this is so bad we should
[02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:18.600]  honestly be having a conversation should the FBI and the faiza courts be shut
[02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:24.400]  down well I think that's ultimately where it should be headed I mean the FBI is
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:30.080]  so rife with political appointments I'm not sure it can be redeemed it may have
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:34.960]  to be completely shut down in order to be saved and then started over again and
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:39.800]  what good is the FBI if they fall for fake documents well and also it's
[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:44.080]  turning out I think this Carter Page which was the predicate the individual
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:49.320]  they got the initial faiza court order to do electronic surveillance on he
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:56.320]  appears to be an FBI undercover agent so it looks like the FBI planted Carter
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:25:03.400]  Page in the Trump transition team of not earlier in order to have him be the
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:08.320]  reason now him talking to others about Russia Russia Russia which they the
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:11.760]  others may not have been talking about to start with and then everybody he talked
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:18.480]  to about Russia becomes a subject not the target of the faiza white wire court
[02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:24.440]  but the collateral target who ultimately gets unmasked and named when the
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:29.160]  information hits the White House through Valerie Jarrett and Susan Rice and the
[02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:35.720]  others so if the if Carter Page is a plant this is an entrapment scheme you
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:40.000]  basically have the FBI not only deciding they're going to do electronic
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:43.760]  surveillance on the Trump campaign the Trump transition Trump White House but
[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:48.320]  they're going to do it by planting an FBI agent in the midst of the Trump
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:54.320]  campaign and then using him talking to Russians as the reason they're going to
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:59.600]  do electronic surveillance on the others but we're not talking to Russians well
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:04.800]  this is open shut case of abuse of power in the FBI the DOJ and the faiza
[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:07.840]  court I mean that's open and shut there should already be heads rolling there
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:11.520]  should already be a rest made I mean you know we're just patient I suppose with
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:16.680]  this but this really ticks me off and it really goes beyond that though and you
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:20.520]  know that's the case this is treason at the highest levels of government it's
[02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:24.960]  time to call it what it is we caught him red-handed and you bring up Valerie
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:28.560]  Jarrett we'll get more into that on the other side with what was alleged in the
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:35.440]  recent QAnon post but I mean I mean do you think the American people have the
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:39.320]  patience to just sit around and wait for people to be arrested I mean how long are
[02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:42.840]  we gonna have to wait till these cases of high treason these cases of abuse of
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:48.280]  a power are actually met with some justice and some charges I know it and
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:53.440]  I continue to seek to sense the impatience which is now happening from
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:58.800]  those who have understood the extent of corruption and basically what was a
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:05.440]  coup d'etat was an attempt by the Obama people with Hillary to steal the
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:11.240]  election away from Trump by creating this false Russian narrative as a basis to
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:15.120]  impeach Trump and deny him the ability to be president after he won the
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:20.440]  election in the electoral college vote so it's a coup d'etat and the American
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:24.480]  people when they realize this and see the extent of corruption you know going to
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:30.480]  the FISA court based on this Carter page who I think was an FBI plant using the
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:37.600]  FISA the Fusion GPS Christopher Steele dossier which we know to have been
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:43.400]  opposition research filled with lies it's complete corruption on the part of
[02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:49.640]  the it makes a travesty of the Fourth Amendment and makes a travesty of any
[02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:53.920]  of the procedures designed in the FISA court law in order to protect Americans
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:57.040]  from electronic surveillance you've got electronic surveillance at the highest
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:01.600]  level the opposition candidate to be president and what if this had happened
[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:06.360]  to the Democrats what if the Democrats had used my research as the basis you
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:10.760]  know the if the Republicans used my research as the basis for wiretapping
[02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:16.400]  Barack Obama's campaign I mean there'd be demand to roll in the street they
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:20.240]  they want to say that Obama isn't in this for political reasons Obama is
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:23.480]  trying to protect his own hide Obama was breaking the law Obama knew Hillary had
[02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:26.600]  the illegal server he was emailing it that's what he's he's really protecting
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:30.400]  his own hide here but isn't it funny and we're gonna get more into this with
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:34.120]  Dr. Corsi on the other side isn't it funny remember how the media freaked out
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:38.000]  about Don Jr.'s meeting with the Russian lawyer which was a setup now it's
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:42.560]  admitted she's some triple agent but but here's Hillary Clinton paying for
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:47.560]  opposition research from Russian sources well again and if you understand
[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:51.280]  this you understand it all why didn't the media report on that why does the
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:56.240]  media only cover Don Jr. and not Hillary because they're biased are you happy
[02:28:56.240 --> 02:28:59.560]  washing your hands with harsh chemicals are you happy doing laundry with

[02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:28.920]  Owen Troyer you're listening to the alex jones show you know it's likely in fact
[02:33:28.920 --> 02:33:33.240]  it's evident that treason has been going on at the highest levels of
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:41.000]  government for my entire life and beyond I'm 28 but they've always had the
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:45.960]  control of the power structure they've always had control over the levers of
[02:33:45.960 --> 02:33:49.640]  influence and so they've been able to get away with it and they've been able to
[02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:56.480]  hide it well we elected president Trump who was not a member of the secret
[02:33:56.480 --> 02:34:01.480]  society not a member of the shadow government and all of the sudden their
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:06.480]  control over the power structure their control over the levers of influence
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:13.600]  took a huge hit a devastating blow to be honest and so what happens Trump gets
[02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:18.160]  in and now we finally get someone who's willing to put out evidence of treason
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:23.960]  how about the JFK papers being released uh hello the FBI lying to people about
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:28.440]  what really happened should have been a huge story just kind of gets shuffled
[02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:32.640]  away okay fine now we've got members of the house intelligence these oversight
[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:36.360]  committees Chuck Grassley Matt Gaetz Devin Nunes and they're saying all
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:43.560]  right well we're free now and we're telling you Hillary Clinton paid for
[02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:48.800]  this dossier colluded with Russia to use it to get a spy warrant on Trump the
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:52.120]  FBI went along with it the DOJ went along with it President Obama went along
[02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:54.840]  with it and Obama wanted to know everything that was going on in the
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:35:00.840]  Hillary Clinton email investigation because he was involved in it so Trump
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:06.600]  getting in was the us cracking their shield of influence cracking their shield
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:10.080]  of power and now we have a chance to bring them down and we have to bring
[02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:14.280]  this forward we have to continue fighting this so I don't know if you
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:18.200]  disagree or agree with all the things that I just mentioned Dr. Corsi I'd
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:22.120]  like to hear your response to that but but I want to get into the story in the
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:26.560]  latest QAnon post and the only reason we cover the QAnon stuff is because it
[02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:31.240]  just continues to be proven right and accurate so we don't know about an
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:36.280]  alleged phone call with Valerie Jarrett and Adam Schiff but but it's indicating
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:39.120]  trees and at least in this post but would you agree with the comments that I
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:41.760]  just made Dr. Corsi that we've been dealing with trees and at the highest
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:44.880]  levels of this government for a long time but now that we finally have someone
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:48.240]  in who's not a member of the secret society we can do something about it I
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:53.800]  agree 100% with everything you said I think you're right on on and that the
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:36:01.320]  point is that we have a far left hard left Democratic Party that Obama Hillary
[02:36:01.320 --> 02:36:05.840]  that have no regard for the Constitution they feel like it's in their
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:10.000]  way they're bigger than the Constitution they're bigger than America
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:15.120]  right and they feel like actually this Constitution's impeding their march
[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:20.000]  towards what they consider social justice which is really a form of
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.480]  socialist to talk or communist to Tolitarianism that really none of us
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:29.040]  want to live under but the point is because they consider themselves above
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:37.640]  us all they have no compunction or fear to break the laws to essentially do
[02:36:37.640 --> 02:36:42.960]  whatever they want to do including committing treason and the fight back on
[02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:48.560]  this the fight back which is going on finally we're getting some exposure of
[02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:53.520]  this and you know I commend you I commend Alex all of us trying to really
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:59.800]  bring the light of the extent of this massive coup d'etat conspiracy that
[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:04.920]  involved right at the top Obama because remember Obama's and Valerie Jenner
[02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:09.120]  getting this information in the White House from the electronic surveillance
[02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:13.840]  they're getting the names of the people you know supposed to be if you're in
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:19.680]  collateral pickup you know your cat Carter page is the person who there is the
[02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:25.280]  target of the FISA electronic service around he talks to Steve Bannon well
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:29.480]  Steve Bannon should be person a in all subsequent reports but instead when it
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:33.560]  gets to the White House they unmask it and say that Steve Bannon and then they
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:38.720]  leak that to the press now that's again a complete violation of the FISA law it's
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:46.040]  a criminal violation yet the Obama White House engaged in that practice for
[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:51.320]  months with impunity and now that it's coming to light the question the people
[02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:55.280]  who are recognizing the severity of this trees and the extent of it are asking is
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:59.440]  why aren't people being indicted why aren't heads rolling and I think the
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:02.720]  patience of the American people is wearing then well and there's a perfect
[02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:10.200]  storm here of diametrically diametrically opposed views so a liberal
[02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:13.720]  listening to this or a trumpeter listening this is like oh my gosh look at
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:17.800]  infowars insinuating that Obama was guilty of treason then Clinton was
[02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:23.200]  guilty of treason it was Trump Trump was guilty of treason so you say okay well
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:28.280]  how was Trump guilty of treason and what is the response every time he colluded
[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:32.480]  with Russia well perfect how did he collude with Russia and then their
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:36.480]  argument falls flat then you see how shallow it is but wait a second okay
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:41.480]  since you're so up in arms about collusion with Russia being considered
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:45.360]  treason well let's look at actual collusion with Russia let's get an
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:48.880]  investigation to the uranium one scandal let's get an investigation to
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:52.440]  Christopher Steele who had Russian sources to get his Clinton paid for
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:59.720]  document fictionalized and made up but they won't do it I don't I mean
[02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:02.400]  that's of course yeah I really don't know how to I don't I don't know where
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:05.560]  this ends I don't know where the rubber meets the road here they're calling for
[02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:11.240]  civil war they know at the top the actual brainwashers who know their line
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:13.960]  of the people they know at the top it was Clinton that colluded with Russia it
[02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:17.200]  was Clinton that was guilty of treason that's why they blame oh that's why
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:20.360]  they blame Trump Obama's guilty of treason Clinton's guilty of treason
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:23.720]  right Comey the ocean they're probably all involved in this treason they were
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:27.200]  all doing it together and we see it and we know it we have the dates we have the
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:30.400]  names we have the declassified memos we have the declassified documents we have
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:33.600]  the text messages we have the emails we got them red-handed and they keep saying
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:37.800]  Trump Russia Trump Russia Trump Russia do they ever flip the leaf Dr. Corsi do
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:41.200]  they ever flip the leaf and realize wow we've got nothing on Trump Russia
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:45.320]  we've got everything on Hillary Russia everything on Obama breaking the law do
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:49.080]  they ever turn that leaf or do they just go full-bore mental and actually try to
[02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:53.800]  incite a real civil war in the streets well I've got confidence I think that
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:57.960]  Donald Trump is the only president capable of bringing these people to
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:05.640]  justice and it's not going to be easy because the the deep state is very much
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:12.120]  in control of the mainstream media the intelligence agencies Barna justice IRS
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:18.720]  FBI CIA the holdovers from the Obama administration and even the Clinton
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:23.880]  administration before that are dead set against the Constitution they're dead
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:29.560]  set against the rule of law and this one I've been following QAnon because
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:35.000]  QAnon has been remarkably prescient in predicting things he QAnon predictor
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:40.960]  that we would have the newness memo which occurred a week ago today a lot has
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:44.320]  happened to the end said it would be a narrative changer that it would show
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:50.680]  that the fusion GPS dossier was used to get the Pfizer war a wiretap or
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:55.520]  electronic surveillance approval that was the case now what QAnon is saying
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:03.200]  and I think this memo this post of Valerie Jarrett with Adam Schiff 42 minutes
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:11.120]  13 seconds all the listeners article 3 section 3 basically put a shift on notice
[02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:16.400]  and Valerie Jarrett that the US intelligence agencies at least the NSA
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:21.640]  are now working in conjunction with the Trump administration and very possibly
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:27.320]  even some martial law powers invoked here I believe that I doubt there was any
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:32.120]  Pfizer warrant to spy on Adam Schiffer Valerie Jarrett precisely and here you
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:37.800]  might have had a declarator I think Q is military intelligence which ultimately
[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:41.320]  trumps all of the wait a second you think oh there's the Valerie Jarrett power
[02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:44.320]  matrix thank you for pulling that up guys we got 60 seconds left in this
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:52.040]  segment dr. Corsi so so do you think that this was Admiral Rogers and the NSA
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:56.280]  fighting back against this corruption I mean let's say this phone call does
[02:41:56.280 --> 02:41:59.080]  exist I mean how do they acquire that do you think that's the NSA and Admiral
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:03.840]  Rogers a combination I think it's actually the behind-the-scenes Trump
[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:09.040]  has invoked some special powers you know the that declaration the executive
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:14.200]  order he signed in December 21st seizing the ability to seize the assets of
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:19.800]  those engaged in human trafficking or corruption mm-hmm that declared a state
[02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:24.520]  of emergency under state of emergency I think military intelligence is gonna
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:29.560]  have the ability to access data out of the NSA and that's what's happening this
[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:33.480]  is the beginning of the counterattack gonna take a little while but I think
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:36.800]  it's gonna be a massive counterattack Trump is gonna launch and I think it's
[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:40.760]  gonna be successful ladies and gentlemen we are in the second American
[02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:44.960]  Revolution and just like in the first American Revolution we have to invoke
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:48.640]  God we have to pray we have to get our spirit right if we're gonna be victorious
[02:42:48.640 --> 02:42:53.000]  dr. Corsi thank you so much great content as usual at info wars.com from

[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:04.440]  support at info wars store.com I'm gonna do a news blitz here and then I got to
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:09.480]  get to a video clip so let's just pound through this news I'm gonna have to get
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:12.720]  more into this probably later on and there'll be more I'm sure that comes
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:18.840]  out about this but second Trump Russia dossier being assessed by FBI so they've
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:22.720]  got the real story here is they're doubling down they're tripling down
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:25.520]  they're not gonna give up they're gonna keep making up fake stories they're
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:28.120]  gonna make up fake dossiers they're just gonna continue with this Russian
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:32.720]  collusion crap until they're all in jail I mean that's that's it it's it's it's
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:37.680]  Russian collusion or jail for them and they have nothing on Russian collusion so
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:41.360]  I think we know where that equation goes but we'll monitor whatever fake second
[02:50:41.360 --> 02:50:45.240]  dossier that they have here Rose McGowan's manager at time of alleged
[02:50:45.240 --> 02:50:53.680]  Weinstein rapes commit suicide so this is Jill Messick has allegedly committed
[02:50:53.680 --> 02:50:58.440]  suicide now and there's all kinds of rumors about what may have happened but
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:01.880]  I'm not even gonna pontificate on what I think may be going on here I just want
[02:51:01.880 --> 02:51:05.760]  to report it and just say that there's been a string of suicides involving this
[02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:10.920]  whole me too thing involving this whole pedophilia thing and there's
[02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:14.440]  definitely something behind it I'm not sure if this case is the same as some of
[02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:19.200]  the other cases that we've seen of suicide with people being you know accused
[02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:23.400]  of sexual assault or accused of child pedophilia and stuff like that but just
[02:51:23.400 --> 02:51:26.880]  added on to what's going on with this me too movement which you know would have
[02:51:26.880 --> 02:51:29.360]  never happened if Hillary was president because you can't have a me too
[02:51:29.360 --> 02:51:33.360]  movement with Bill Clinton in the White House White House a rapist LAPD
[02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:37.640]  submits three Harvey Weinstein sex cases to district attorney mmm maybe this
[02:51:37.640 --> 02:51:42.800]  had something to do with the last story so now the DA and LA has three at least
[02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:45.840]  three I mean I think there might even be more than that now to be honest with
[02:51:45.840 --> 02:51:51.520]  you so what will happen to Harvey Weinstein hashtag me too movement
[02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:55.760]  lawmaker investigated for sexual misconduct allegations so you've got
[02:51:55.760 --> 02:52:00.440]  California assemblywoman Christina Garcia a leader of the me too movement a
[02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:06.600]  total fraud just like the rest of them total frauds and now she's been accused
[02:52:06.600 --> 02:52:10.720]  of sexual harassment against a male staffer and you know I'll actually be
[02:52:10.720 --> 02:52:15.600]  honest with you Rose McGowan who I think is off the rocker but I think she's
[02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:19.520]  rogue at this point I think she just she's got she's just looking at everyone
[02:52:19.520 --> 02:52:25.200]  like I'm taking all y'all down because I mean it's just wild stuff what's going
[02:52:25.200 --> 02:52:31.160]  on in Hollywood right now don't tell Conan O'Brien but talks opfam oxfam
[02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:36.480]  staff paid Haiti quake survivors for sex but don't tell Conan O'Brien that
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:41.080]  the sex trade is rampant and Haiti don't tell Conan O'Brien that Laura
[02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:45.560]  Silsby got caught crossing the Haitian border with minors that were not
[02:52:45.560 --> 02:52:50.400]  documented don't let Conan O'Brien know about that he thinks Haiti is a
[02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:56.200]  wonderful place I wish it were George W. Bush as Russia meddled in 2006 US
[02:52:56.200 --> 02:53:03.680]  election oh Georgie boy oh Georgie boy no he's not talking about Hillary
[02:53:03.680 --> 02:53:07.520]  Clinton and Christopher Steele colluding with Russians not talking about
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:12.440]  Mark Warner contacting Russians he's talking about Trump he's talking about
[02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:18.040]  Russians trying to hack our election thanks Georgie boy for letting us know
[02:53:18.040 --> 02:53:22.080]  who you really are who side you're really on a traitor
[02:53:22.080 --> 02:53:26.840]  I'm a rosa I wouldn't vote for Trump again in a million years never now this
[02:53:26.840 --> 02:53:29.840]  is a strange story if you've been following it it's kind of like the
[02:53:29.840 --> 02:53:35.280]  Bannon deal Bannon is in leading member of the Trumpists conservative movement
[02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:40.640]  now he's out now he's the bad guy I'm a rosa in there you know stumping for
[02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:45.000]  Trump she's always speaking positive for Trump then she's out no I'm not voting
[02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:50.680]  for Trump and so there's two sides of the story are they the traitors or are
[02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:54.760]  they mad that they no longer have the access to Trump that they once had I'm
[02:53:54.760 --> 02:54:00.240]  not sure but those are the two angles Olympics open with Koreans marching
[02:54:00.240 --> 02:54:05.640]  together offering hope for peace wow so wait Trump is effective it is foreign
[02:54:05.640 --> 02:54:10.800]  policy no they'll never let you know about that the Koreans coming together
[02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:16.120]  for the Olympics now this was actually funny Trump and Kim thrown out of a
[02:54:16.120 --> 02:54:20.200]  opening ceremony so you had this guy dressed up as Trump and this guy dressed
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:22.880]  up as Kim Jong-un they went to the Olympics together and they got kicked
[02:54:22.880 --> 02:54:28.040]  out why wouldn't you this is hilarious this is the kind of stuff this is the
[02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:32.480]  wussification of sports you can't even go to a sporting event anymore and
[02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:36.840]  actually be a sports fan you can't go oh my gosh we're at the opening Olympics
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:40.040]  and somebody's dressed like Trump and Kim Jong-un shut it down kick them out
[02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:44.000]  why can't we have fun at a sporting event why can't we have fun anymore and
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:50.000]  laugh at things it just sucks how about this one the war against Zika fighting
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:53.400]  mosquitoes with mosquitoes so now thousands of male mosquitoes have been
[02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:58.920]  released in in Miami to fight against Zika so so basically engineered
[02:54:58.920 --> 02:55:05.240]  mosquitoes are being released into Miami to fight Zika oh this is so infuriating
[02:55:05.240 --> 02:55:10.480]  that's what started Zika the engineered mosquitoes in Brazil is what
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:15.400]  started Zika and so now they're doing it again to fight Zika this is insanity
[02:55:15.400 --> 02:55:20.160]  meanwhile in the communist utopia of Venezuela a major league baseball
[02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:27.720]  players mother Elias Diaz's mother has been kidnapped that is horrible that's
[02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:31.000]  just like the NFL linebacker that killed by the illegal immigrant do you
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:34.000]  understand why we want borders do you understand why we don't want communism
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:38.760]  now they just don't listen now let's go to this clip past your Paul Begley
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:42.520]  saying Melania Trump wanted the house the white the White House completely
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:47.880]  exercised before she moved in I have to say when the president allowed 40
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:52.040]  pastors to come into the White House and anointing with oil lay their hands and
[02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:56.800]  pray on him seven times he's done and that's unheard of we haven't ever so I
[02:55:56.800 --> 02:56:01.400]  mean the guy's got flaws we all do okay but at least he is humble enough and
[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:05.440]  recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the
[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:09.240]  prayer and and I gotta say this I mean it might have started with the first lady
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:13.080]  I'm gonna just be honest with you the first lady in that five hours when the
[02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:17.040]  Obama's and the and the Trump's went down to the Capitol and Trump is being
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:21.080]  sworn in a 45th person imagine moving into our house after the Obama said to
[02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:25.080]  her oh she said I'm not gonna go into that White House unless it has been
[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:30.120]  completely exercised I mean because apparently over the eight years that the
[02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:34.440]  that Obama was there and maybe even some of the presidents before him there was
[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:38.880]  all kinds of idol gods and images all kinds of artifacts I don't think I could
[02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:41.480]  move into a house after the Obama's I think I'd have to burn it to the ground
[02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:44.600]  we're from the Clinton era because they were really tiny with the Haitians I can
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:47.760]  tell you you can read the serpent in the rainbow story and you'll find out just
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:51.640]  how much Haitian witch doctor influence was on Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton's
[02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:54.400]  lives when they constantly went back there they spent their honeymoon with a
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:57:00.160]  witch doctor who does that but Melania said you got to get all that out of there
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:04.920]  and send in God bless the first lady I don't make the first lady a lady again
[02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:08.880]  preachers and priests and anyone go in there and cleanse the White House or I
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:12.480]  will not spend one night in there and he did during that five hours when they're
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:18.040]  ripping out carpets and just thank God thank God for the faith of Melania
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:23.520]  Trump thank God for the spirituality of President Trump and Melania Trump man
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:27.560]  could you imagine moving into the house that those demons occupied the
[02:57:27.560 --> 02:57:32.680]  Obamas and the Clintons with all their witch doctor Haitian you know nonsense
[02:57:32.680 --> 02:57:37.360]  Obama probably doing Muslim calls to prayer I couldn't do it but Melania had
[02:57:37.360 --> 02:57:42.040]  the White House exercised hopefully it worked she couldn't exercise it from
[02:57:42.040 --> 02:57:47.320]  all the spy equipment they left over though I want to plow into all of this

[03:00:40.560 --> 03:00:44.800]  art of the insult featuring Donald Trump's campaign they said you can't
[03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:49.280]  insult your way to the presidency Donald that come from low-energy Jeb Bush I
[03:00:49.280 --> 03:00:54.480]  guess you could say he did that and then Joel Gilbert documented that in his
[03:00:54.480 --> 03:00:59.840]  newest film Trump the art of the insult available at infowarsstore.com so Joel
[03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:04.240]  Gilbert joins me he's about to take over here Joel what is on tap for the fourth
[03:01:04.240 --> 03:01:08.600]  hour of the Alex Jones show well two things we're really gonna get into the
[03:01:08.600 --> 03:01:12.640]  dossier and talk about some things that no one has brought up before and I'm
[03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:17.120]  gonna give you some more background I've got an article on info wars today about
[03:01:17.120 --> 03:01:21.440]  how it all went down some of it's pretty funny but there's also some truth to it
[03:01:21.440 --> 03:01:26.440]  so I'm gonna sort that out and at the bottom of the hour I've got conservative
[03:01:26.440 --> 03:01:30.800]  warrior David Horowitz from the David Horowitz Freedom Center people know him
[03:01:30.800 --> 03:01:35.600]  from his book radical son of course discover the networks where he puts all
[03:01:35.600 --> 03:01:40.640]  the leftist networks together so you can see it and he's had a big influence on
[03:01:40.640 --> 03:01:44.240]  on the country so first time on info wars will be talking to him for quite a
[03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:49.920]  while at the bottom of the hour you know we're getting all of this exposed
[03:01:49.920 --> 03:01:54.320]  right now about what Obama did the collusion with the FBI the DOJ how he
[03:01:54.320 --> 03:01:56.640]  wanted to know everything that was going on in the Hillary Clinton email
[03:01:56.640 --> 03:02:00.080]  investigation I believe that's because he was involved in that he knew that she
[03:02:00.080 --> 03:02:03.920]  had the server who knows what he knew about it but I think he was also
[03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:07.760]  emailing things to that server and so I think he's trying to trying to protect
[03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:11.840]  his own hide this but so we're kind of getting this more into the public
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:17.000]  atmosphere if you will about how corrupt Obama was about how big of a fraud he
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:21.520]  was and then also about how criminal and treasonous he was but but you did the
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:26.000]  film dreams of my real father documenting Obama's real upbringing his real
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:30.520]  life do you think that the American people ever get that deep into the truth
[03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:36.040]  about Obama do you think it ever goes there it goes there it takes a long time
[03:02:36.040 --> 03:02:41.160]  when my first film first came out dreams of my real father 2012 people would
[03:02:41.160 --> 03:02:45.080]  say well this can't be true because CNN would have covered it or Fox certainly
[03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:49.680]  would have covered it that he's not who he says he is the film walked you through
[03:02:49.680 --> 03:02:53.080]  the fact that his real father was not the Kenyan Obama the man he based his
[03:02:53.080 --> 03:02:57.960]  entire political career on but his father was a Soviet agent and pro-Russia
[03:02:57.960 --> 03:03:02.080]  communist propagandist named Frank Marshall Davis that raised him and
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:06.000]  radicalized him in Hawaii so as the years go by since then it's been about five
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:09.720]  years people are much more knowledgeable how the media has been
[03:03:09.720 --> 03:03:14.760]  covering for Obama and how corrupt he really is and finally we're getting a
[03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:21.000]  lot of the real proof that Obama is a radical he's a was someone who was in
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:24.840]  the little known world of American Marxism from his childhood and all the
[03:03:24.840 --> 03:03:28.840]  way back to Chicago where his real father Frank Marshall Davis was one of
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:32.680]  the original black Bolsheviks the blacks who were recruited by white
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:38.440]  communists to try to get black people to come into the movement so people are
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:43.160]  learning more and more I think the public gets it now and that's why there's a
[03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:48.480]  real chance to really expose Obama and the entire network of Chicago Marxist
[03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:51.960]  radicals for what they really are yeah keep that just keep that image up for
[03:03:51.960 --> 03:03:58.400]  second guys I mean if that's not Barack Obama's real daddy I mean come on yeah
[03:03:58.400 --> 03:04:03.640]  the canyon Obama was a sham marriage you know forget about the biology if you
[03:04:03.640 --> 03:04:07.280]  don't care about the biology Obama admittedly was raised by Frank Marshall
[03:04:07.280 --> 03:04:12.600]  Davis he spent every day with him Frank Marshall Davis taught him to hate
[03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:18.280]  taught him things like you know America is evil it's racist you're a black man
[03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:22.040]  you can never become a lawyer you can never go to Harvard you can never be
[03:04:22.040 --> 03:04:26.240]  president because you're black you know that guy Joseph Stalin oh yeah that's
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:29.880]  that's a great you know you know you could be like him so this is the
[03:04:29.880 --> 03:04:34.520]  nonsense that he was taught and he went this is the nonsense they continue to
[03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:38.440]  raise their kids on just listen to Nancy Pelosi's speech yesterday talking about
[03:04:38.440 --> 03:04:42.520]  how oh she's ashamed to be white oh her grandson wishes that she had brown skin
[03:04:42.520 --> 03:04:45.440]  I mean it's all the same and I'll just say I was it's crazy if you really go
[03:04:45.440 --> 03:04:48.120]  down the rabbit hole I won't say it now but all so many of these families are
[03:04:48.120 --> 03:04:50.840]  fake folks I mean so many of these families are fake you wouldn't even

[03:06:42.520 --> 03:06:47.120]  of the hour gonna have conservative warrior David Horowitz from the David
[03:06:47.120 --> 03:06:51.920]  Horowitz Freedom Center editor of front page magazine very well known for his
[03:06:51.920 --> 03:06:57.760]  famous book radical son where he talks about coming over from a Marxist
[03:06:57.760 --> 03:07:02.120]  communist family to become one of the great conservative leaders talk about
[03:07:02.120 --> 03:07:06.400]  his website discover the networks and so many more things so we're looking
[03:07:06.400 --> 03:07:10.680]  forward to seeing David Horowitz for the first time on infowars now I want to
[03:07:10.680 --> 03:07:14.800]  spend some time getting a little deeper into what I call the vast left wing
[03:07:14.800 --> 03:07:20.240]  conspiracy courtesy of Hillary Clinton from her misdirection many years ago
[03:07:20.240 --> 03:07:24.040]  there never was a vast right wing conspiracy but today we have the vast
[03:07:24.040 --> 03:07:30.280]  left wing conspiracy free and fair elections are the basis of democracy the
[03:07:30.280 --> 03:07:36.120]  very basis with no free elections we are not free we know very well that Barack
[03:07:36.120 --> 03:07:40.520]  Obama and the Democrats interfered in the 2012 elections by suppressing the
[03:07:40.520 --> 03:07:44.240]  conservatives from organizing no grassroots movement for the conservatives
[03:07:44.240 --> 03:07:49.560]  all the left organized now we're finding out more and more every day how bad it
[03:07:49.560 --> 03:07:55.480]  was that Obama's Justice Department and FBI interfered in the 2016 election
[03:07:55.480 --> 03:08:00.640]  Trump probably would have won by a much higher margin had they not been interfering
[03:08:00.640 --> 03:08:05.560]  so first I think I want to do is talk about the never Trumpers the never
[03:08:05.560 --> 03:08:12.400]  Trumpers now do you get it do you get it the never Trumpers said we can't support
[03:08:12.400 --> 03:08:15.360]  Trump because he's not a perfect conservative he's gonna ruin the
[03:08:15.360 --> 03:08:19.200]  conservative movement this was their their line some of them are still there
[03:08:19.200 --> 03:08:25.800]  today and you have even the Bush family voted for Hillary remember John Kasich
[03:08:25.800 --> 03:08:29.760]  the convention was in his home state wouldn't go wouldn't go there he said
[03:08:29.760 --> 03:08:34.760]  it wouldn't vote for Trump Ted Cruz didn't get it at first didn't get it he
[03:08:34.760 --> 03:08:38.720]  didn't endorse Trump but then he came around I wrote an article also on
[03:08:38.720 --> 03:08:44.200]  front-page magazine called cruises courageous right move where he did the
[03:08:44.200 --> 03:08:50.240]  right thing he realized and he knew all along how much was it stay so it's clear
[03:08:50.240 --> 03:08:54.680]  now you can see these never Trumpers and anybody else that if Hillary Clinton had
[03:08:54.680 --> 03:08:59.640]  won there would be no more democracy no more free elections and the United States
[03:08:59.640 --> 03:09:04.880]  as we know will be finished Hillary would serve two terms and she would
[03:09:04.880 --> 03:09:11.200]  further embed and bias the DOJ and FBI IRS every other government agency so in
[03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:15.680]  eight years you'd have another radical leftist or maybe Chelsea for all we know
[03:09:15.680 --> 03:09:21.040]  American business would be taxed out of business illegals would pour into the
[03:09:21.040 --> 03:09:27.320]  country and the economy would crash anybody who had any savings your savings
[03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:32.480]  would disappear into a bankrupt socialist state so I think hopefully now
[03:09:32.480 --> 03:09:37.720]  Americans are understanding that these people are ruthless radicals the
[03:09:37.720 --> 03:09:42.960]  Democrat Party has become a radical socialist party now I wrote in my
[03:09:42.960 --> 03:09:47.880]  article today on info wars about the $12 million dossier how it went down and I
[03:09:47.880 --> 03:09:53.040]  looked at it from the monetary point of view that the DNC is 12 million six
[03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:59.160]  million dollars in debt now they paid 12 million through laundering it through
[03:09:59.160 --> 03:10:03.240]  their law firm Perkins Koy by the way that's the same law firm that handled
[03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:07.560]  Obama's birth certificate and they laundered the money to Chris deal and
[03:10:07.560 --> 03:10:13.040]  Russian intelligence retired spies according to what I believe to write
[03:10:13.040 --> 03:10:16.440]  this dossier leaving themselves six million in debt I wrote in my article
[03:10:16.440 --> 03:10:19.200]  they probably didn't even care that they were six million in debt they would
[03:10:19.200 --> 03:10:24.280]  recover that money from Russians or foreign donations later on because I
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:29.640]  wrote an article with Jack Cascio in the American thinker the week before that it
[03:10:29.640 --> 03:10:33.480]  was very clear from the language we studied the language the punctuation
[03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:39.000]  problems the the usage of of English words that didn't make any sense that
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:43.560]  this was not written by somebody whose language first language was English it
[03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:49.120]  was written by a Russian so this is what the Russians essentially shook down the
[03:10:49.120 --> 03:10:53.320]  DNC for 12 million dollars on the one hand it's kind of comical on the other
[03:10:53.320 --> 03:10:59.520]  hand it's very serious now the best quote in that article was from former KGB
[03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:04.520]  spy Konstantin Preba Jinsky he's a defector who lives in the United States
[03:11:04.520 --> 03:11:11.200]  and he looked at the dossier and here's what he told me very insightful he said
[03:11:11.200 --> 03:11:15.280]  there is no information in the dossier whatsoever it's just foolish
[03:11:15.280 --> 03:11:20.480]  speculation there are no references it is not an intelligence document of any
[03:11:20.480 --> 03:11:27.800]  kind I was laughing when I was reading it now here's someone who was in KGB for
[03:11:27.800 --> 03:11:32.840]  years so if he can look at it and realize how ridiculous it is and I can look
[03:11:32.840 --> 03:11:36.760]  at it and see it was not written by any one who speaks English for a first
[03:11:36.760 --> 03:11:42.280]  language obviously the FBI could look at it or the DOJ and see that it was it was
[03:11:42.280 --> 03:11:46.120]  a total joke but how did we get here that's what I want to talk about how
[03:11:46.120 --> 03:11:51.720]  deep does this go I want to bring up some things you may not know about Peter
[03:11:51.720 --> 03:11:57.600]  Struck of course the guy writes the text and headed up the Hillary email
[03:11:57.600 --> 03:12:01.160]  investigation and started the Trump-Russian investigation I want to
[03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:04.880]  tell you something that his the father of his sister-in-law this is someone he
[03:12:04.880 --> 03:12:12.560]  knows was pardoned by Obama right before he left office for leaking now what did
[03:12:12.560 --> 03:12:17.360]  he leak this is Peter Struck's the father of Peter Struck's sister-in-law was
[03:12:17.360 --> 03:12:22.120]  named General James Cartwright former vice chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff
[03:12:22.120 --> 03:12:27.360]  and he got charged and convicted of lying about speaking to the New York
[03:12:27.360 --> 03:12:32.280]  Times about the U.S. and Israeli efforts to cripple the Iranian nuclear program
[03:12:32.280 --> 03:12:38.400]  the struck Struck's net virus so I thought well how could it be that Peter
[03:12:38.400 --> 03:12:44.520]  Struck knows this guy who tried to destroy the the program to destroy
[03:12:44.520 --> 03:12:48.480]  Iranians Iranian nuclear program he leaked he could he have leaked it through
[03:12:48.480 --> 03:12:52.680]  a relative well we know that James Comey doesn't like to link directly to the
[03:12:52.680 --> 03:12:56.840]  press so could it be that Peter Struck was leaking on behalf of Obama several
[03:12:56.840 --> 03:13:02.880]  years ago you have to ask why would Obama pardon a guy who had leaked who
[03:13:02.880 --> 03:13:08.440]  knew Peter Struck so how deep does this go I don't forget we said Obama
[03:13:08.440 --> 03:13:13.800]  weaponized the IRS in 2012 of course my bank account if you remember was given
[03:13:13.800 --> 03:13:17.640]  to a leftist reporter out of San Francisco because I made the movie
[03:13:17.640 --> 03:13:22.120]  dreams for my real father where I said Obama was a complete fraud and somehow
[03:13:22.120 --> 03:13:27.800]  they got a hold of private information you have to wonder did the FBI have
[03:13:27.800 --> 03:13:31.720]  something on John Roberts just Chief Justice to get him to vote for Obamacare
[03:13:31.720 --> 03:13:38.480]  these are now legitimate questions this is not any speculation anymore now have
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:43.760]  you ever seen Carter Page on TV ever see him try to answer questions I saw him
[03:13:43.760 --> 03:13:49.320]  on Laura Ingram this guy can't answer a question straight his body language is
[03:13:49.320 --> 03:13:55.120]  very weird we researched him and found out he was a Democrat and if you just
[03:13:55.120 --> 03:13:59.280]  look at him there's just something wrong there and when he starts to talk
[03:13:59.280 --> 03:14:04.040]  there's something wrong so we have to ask the question was he a plant working
[03:14:04.040 --> 03:14:12.040]  for the FBI just like we know that the Russian lawyer Natalia Beselenskaya was
[03:14:12.040 --> 03:14:16.200]  meeting with Fusion GPS and got a visa to the end of the United States for Loretta
[03:14:16.200 --> 03:14:26.080]  Lynch that was a setup so how deep does this go if we can't have free elections
[03:14:26.080 --> 03:14:33.840]  we're not free now why did the Democrat Party become so radicalized how did it
[03:14:33.840 --> 03:14:38.200]  become this way well when after the break I'm going to get into that in
[03:14:38.200 --> 03:14:42.160]  detail but just remember this that starting in the 50s the Russians
[03:14:42.160 --> 03:14:45.760]  understood they could not defeat the United States militarily because of our
[03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:52.480]  nuclear capability they also understood there would be no workers revolution so
[03:14:52.480 --> 03:14:56.080]  they sought out to use politics they saw the weakness of the United States was
[03:14:56.080 --> 03:14:59.880]  its political system and its open society like George Soros has the open
[03:14:59.880 --> 03:15:05.880]  society you know foundation the open society was the way to destroy the
[03:15:05.880 --> 03:15:11.240]  United States they could slowly over time take over the Democrat Party and
[03:15:11.240 --> 03:15:15.920]  turn it into a radical party it eventually worked and that's where we are
[03:15:15.920 --> 03:15:22.040]  today such that the entire apparatus of the government is now supporting radical
[03:15:22.040 --> 03:15:27.840]  leftists to maintain power the goal of this is to eventually allow Russia to
[03:15:27.840 --> 03:15:34.560]  exercise its power and use its will around the world and not be constrained
[03:15:34.560 --> 03:15:38.080]  by the power of the United States after the break we're going to look very
[03:15:38.080 --> 03:15:42.760]  closely at the people in power and the connections and the networks before we
[03:15:42.760 --> 03:15:48.960]  talk to David Horowitz at the end of the half hour be right back

[03:19:18.880 --> 03:19:23.640]  symptoms like running nose itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus production
[03:19:23.640 --> 03:19:28.520]  they began studying the effects in public trials in their public trials now

[03:20:17.520 --> 03:20:33.000]  welcome back to the alex jones show I am your host joel Gilbert coming to you
[03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:38.400]  right from the left coast we're talking about how we got to this situation what
[03:20:38.400 --> 03:20:43.400]  is going on how deep is this that we have so many government agencies working
[03:20:43.400 --> 03:20:48.520]  against the American people let's take a look at today's leading Democrats the
[03:20:48.520 --> 03:20:52.280]  ones that people vote for and voted for recently of course we have Barack Obama
[03:20:52.280 --> 03:20:58.240]  who I have identified as a red diaper baby the child of a Soviet agent this is
[03:20:58.240 --> 03:21:02.680]  the man that raised him Frank Marshall Davis whispering in his ear things like
[03:21:02.680 --> 03:21:08.800]  you know America really sucks there's a perfect world Russia Stalin the Soviet
[03:21:08.800 --> 03:21:14.000]  Union that's the ticket Barry everyone's really happy hey Barry have a little
[03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:20.920]  more marijuana Stalin is great there's no gulags there's no starvation you could
[03:21:20.920 --> 03:21:27.080]  be that guy one day this is Obama being raised by a radical then we have Hillary
[03:21:27.080 --> 03:21:33.040]  Clinton an ally of Saul Alinsky the Chicago radical who taught the rules for
[03:21:33.040 --> 03:21:37.480]  radical she wrote her thesis on Saul Alinsky Saul Alinsky liked her so much
[03:21:37.480 --> 03:21:42.640]  he wanted to hire her and she wrote him a letter we have a copy of the letter she
[03:21:42.640 --> 03:21:47.880]  said Saul I love you but I don't want to come to Chicago to work for you I want
[03:21:47.880 --> 03:21:54.120]  to work within the system I want to try to take over the system from within then
[03:21:54.120 --> 03:21:58.160]  we have Obama's advisor who today of course we see him on CNN every day
[03:21:58.160 --> 03:22:05.560]  David Axelrod both of his parents members of Communist Party USA another
[03:22:05.560 --> 03:22:11.440]  big advisor who influenced so many people and influenced appointments in the
[03:22:11.440 --> 03:22:16.160]  government was of course Valerie Jarrett her father mother father-in-law were
[03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:21.160]  communists Vernon Jarrett worked with Obama's father Frank Marshall Davis on
[03:22:21.160 --> 03:22:29.120]  the Chicago Star the communist newspaper then there's Eric Holder was Attorney
[03:22:29.120 --> 03:22:34.240]  General he said he was Obama's wingman we know that he was in the Black Panthers
[03:22:34.240 --> 03:22:38.520]  at Columbia University he was part of an armed takeover of an empty building
[03:22:38.520 --> 03:22:45.080]  there Eric Holder Attorney General of course there's Bernie Sanders straight up
[03:22:45.080 --> 03:22:52.080]  communists socialists believes in a political revolution another big player
[03:22:52.080 --> 03:22:57.040]  the Democrat Party Keith Ellison number two Democrat worked with the nation of
[03:22:57.040 --> 03:23:02.080]  Islam for years Jonathan Jay was director of Homeland Security his
[03:23:02.080 --> 03:23:09.800]  grandfather Communist Party of course CIA director John Brennan vote admitted
[03:23:09.800 --> 03:23:13.560]  that he voted communists in 1976 he admitted he voted for the Communist
[03:23:13.560 --> 03:23:20.200]  Party so what were Brennan and Holder doing for all those years they turned
[03:23:20.200 --> 03:23:26.800]  the CIA and FBI and DOJ far to the left and the DOJ for example Department of
[03:23:26.800 --> 03:23:34.000]  Justice they only hired lawyers from five organizations the ACLU la Raza the
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:38.840]  Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights the NAACP and the Mexican-American Defense
[03:23:38.840 --> 03:23:41.640]  League if you wanted to work for Department of Justice you had to come
[03:23:41.640 --> 03:23:45.760]  from one of those organizations the Department of Justice became a radical
[03:23:45.760 --> 03:23:54.000]  social justice organization instead of a organization to enforce the law Comey
[03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:58.800]  and Podesta same thing they filled all the positions with radical leftists it's
[03:23:58.800 --> 03:24:03.720]  the same thing like the universities all the universities are filled with jobs
[03:24:03.720 --> 03:24:07.960]  for with liberals and leftists and they took this model and took it into the
[03:24:07.960 --> 03:24:12.480]  federal government that's how we got here so it almost didn't matter to them
[03:24:12.480 --> 03:24:17.560]  if Trump won because they're so deeply embedded in the government that they can
[03:24:17.560 --> 03:24:21.920]  carry on their own agenda and next up on their agenda of course every day
[03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:26.360]  they're pushing for illegals open borders don't build a wall legalize
[03:24:26.360 --> 03:24:32.440]  illegals let's take a look at video that's based on the weight of the poor the
[03:24:32.440 --> 03:24:37.440]  Fox Piven theory that if you overburden the system with people and
[03:24:37.440 --> 03:24:41.960]  obligations and money you can collapse the government and then rebuild it as a
[03:24:41.960 --> 03:24:57.200]  socialist society let's look at my video of the illegals and the weight of the poor
[03:24:57.200 --> 03:25:03.000]  you see the communists are helping people over the border and they want to
[03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:10.160]  give them health care they want to sign them up for free housing disability on
[03:25:10.160 --> 03:25:15.440]  and on because the American voters will no longer support a party that doesn't
[03:25:15.440 --> 03:25:20.240]  make them the priority and that's their theory is to collapse the system this is
[03:25:20.240 --> 03:25:26.040]  a video from my film there's no place like utopia so that's the play right
[03:25:26.040 --> 03:25:32.800]  now the middle America average voter even their traditional base of African
[03:25:32.800 --> 03:25:38.080]  Americans Hispanics they're starting to get it that the Democrat Party hasn't
[03:25:38.080 --> 03:25:41.560]  done anything for them in my film there's no place like utopia I went to
[03:25:41.560 --> 03:25:46.120]  Southside Chicago talked to a lot of black people they just said we got poorer
[03:25:46.120 --> 03:25:50.400]  under Obama things got worse we don't want illegals coming into our community
[03:25:50.400 --> 03:25:55.520]  and driving down wages we don't want marijuana and drugs legalized we want
[03:25:55.520 --> 03:26:03.080]  more police on and on so the radical agenda that was propped up by white
[03:26:03.080 --> 03:26:09.520]  communists in Chicago who recruited Obama Obama had no support amongst black
[03:26:09.520 --> 03:26:13.080]  people in Chicago was only the white liberals and the former radicals out of
[03:26:13.080 --> 03:26:17.840]  the weather underground they knew Obama they didn't support him it was only when
[03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:22.120]  he came on a national stage that he promoted his his phony background we're
[03:26:22.120 --> 03:26:27.240]  gonna get into it with David Horowitz about how his new pamphlet that came out
[03:26:27.240 --> 03:26:32.160]  about how the radical left uses the black community to push their agenda
[03:26:32.160 --> 03:26:37.640]  David Horowitz be up in a few minutes let me first do a little promotion to
[03:26:37.640 --> 03:26:40.800]  help out the show we're gonna go to a break and come back with David Horowitz
[03:26:40.800 --> 03:26:45.840]  I want to remind you to get chocolate or strawberry caveman true paleo formula

[03:33:49.920 --> 03:33:54.560]  David Horowitz David is an American conservative writer he's the founder and
[03:33:54.560 --> 03:33:58.760]  president of the think tank David Horowitz Freedom Center an editor of the
[03:33:58.760 --> 03:34:03.240]  publication you've all seen front page magazine people know him for his book
[03:34:03.240 --> 03:34:08.240]  radical son he tells the story of growing up in a communist family and going
[03:34:08.240 --> 03:34:13.360]  from a conservative rather Marxist intellectual to a conservative warrior he
[03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:19.400]  was also in my film there's no place like utopia David has a new pamphlet out
[03:34:19.400 --> 03:34:24.480]  which he's gonna talk about how progressives use race as a weapon against
[03:34:24.480 --> 03:34:30.320]  our country and the subtitle civilizations die when they cease to believe in
[03:34:30.320 --> 03:34:36.200]  themselves so without further ado can we bring up David Horowitz and talk about
[03:34:36.200 --> 03:34:42.720]  his new his new piece okay well we're gonna get into it shortly David by the
[03:34:42.720 --> 03:34:49.360]  way has five or six organizations if you haven't seen discover the networks is
[03:34:49.360 --> 03:34:54.320]  an entire website that puts together all the leftist George Soros how everyone
[03:34:54.320 --> 03:34:59.120]  is connected all these organizations and how they seek to influence and disrupt
[03:34:59.120 --> 03:35:07.200]  American democracy and using race as a weapon is a phenomenon of the last 20
[03:35:07.200 --> 03:35:13.680]  years where they've been able to organize and convince people and get again
[03:35:13.680 --> 03:35:18.480]  what they used to call black Bolsheviks back in Chicago in the 20s and 30s the
[03:35:18.480 --> 03:35:23.240]  count the white communists would use black leaders to try to convince
[03:35:23.240 --> 03:35:28.360]  African-Americans black people to join the socialist Marxist movement now the
[03:35:28.360 --> 03:35:32.240]  black people in Chicago were no fools they were church-going hard-working
[03:35:32.240 --> 03:35:35.480]  people with strong families they didn't want any part of Marxism and
[03:35:35.480 --> 03:35:41.120]  socialism because it was all about hatred of classes war between classes and
[03:35:41.120 --> 03:35:45.960]  conflict so they weren't very successful but they tried Barack Obama did the
[03:35:45.960 --> 03:35:49.760]  same thing as his real father Frank Marshall Davis the white communists out
[03:35:49.760 --> 03:35:55.760]  of the weather underground in Chicago recruited him to try to convince black
[03:35:55.760 --> 03:36:00.560]  people to join socialism and Marxism they were no fools either at that time
[03:36:00.560 --> 03:36:05.960]  they didn't want any part of this atheist nonsense that said that they need
[03:36:05.960 --> 03:36:11.320]  to go to war against people of different classes Barack Obama tried very hard and
[03:36:11.320 --> 03:36:16.320]  he did end up only many years later inspiring people with this inspiring
[03:36:16.320 --> 03:36:20.600]  tale of a goat herder my father's a goat herder from Kenya I'm gonna bring us
[03:36:20.600 --> 03:36:27.400]  all together had he told the reality which was my father was a Soviet agent
[03:36:27.400 --> 03:36:31.960]  and pro-russian propagandist who worked for the Soviet Union during the Cold
[03:36:31.960 --> 03:36:39.800]  War and tried to up to destroy American democracy and defeat America in the Cold
[03:36:39.800 --> 03:36:43.720]  War please vote for me it never would have worked so we had this false
[03:36:43.720 --> 03:36:48.200]  narrative and that only worked because the media promoted his his false story
[03:36:48.200 --> 03:36:52.000]  that was a disruption of the 2008 election we're supposed to have two
[03:36:52.000 --> 03:36:56.240]  competing parties be able to come together and tell us what their views
[03:36:56.240 --> 03:37:01.840]  are Obama's entire personal background was a fairy tale and his agenda was a
[03:37:01.840 --> 03:37:06.280]  lie as we all know he said I'm gonna cut the deficit in half marriage between a
[03:37:06.280 --> 03:37:13.880]  man and a woman and God everything support the Constitution everything Obama
[03:37:13.880 --> 03:37:18.960]  said was an intentional lie and he is the embodiment of stealth socialism how
[03:37:18.960 --> 03:37:23.440]  socialism and communism went from an open revolution in the 60s we're gonna
[03:37:23.440 --> 03:37:28.760]  destroy the government we're gonna take over to a stealth socialism where they
[03:37:28.760 --> 03:37:33.520]  told their radicals in Chicago keep your Marxism to yourself don't tell
[03:37:33.520 --> 03:37:37.880]  anybody about your socialism until you get elected throw them under the bus and
[03:37:37.880 --> 03:37:44.200]  then we'll force an agenda that nobody voted for and that's the story of where
[03:37:44.200 --> 03:37:49.800]  we are today and how they got so many of these leftist radicals deep deep into
[03:37:49.800 --> 03:37:54.600]  the Justice Department FBI and so many other agencies such that we really cannot
[03:37:54.600 --> 03:37:59.520]  rely on free elections anymore and again if we don't have free elections we are
[03:37:59.520 --> 03:38:05.000]  not free any luck for David Horowitz yet
[03:38:05.920 --> 03:38:16.760]  all right David welcome to the Alex Jones show great to have you okay now all
[03:38:16.760 --> 03:38:22.120]  right well look we talked about your new pamphlet let's start out by what is the
[03:38:22.120 --> 03:38:30.800]  importance of the American founders view of its citizens as individuals well it's
[03:38:30.800 --> 03:38:35.880]  the antithesis of collectivism which is the ideology of the left and the
[03:38:35.880 --> 03:38:41.440]  Democratic Party it means they can judge people on their merit by their
[03:38:41.440 --> 03:38:48.600]  origins or their skin color their race or their ethnicity the Democratic Party
[03:38:48.600 --> 03:38:55.920]  progressive races and their races in the service of destroying this country I
[03:38:55.920 --> 03:39:02.360]  mean their agenda is to destroy America and you know that because they they
[03:39:02.360 --> 03:39:07.080]  talk about America the white supremacist society the most tolerant inclusive
[03:39:07.080 --> 03:39:15.360]  non-depremacist society on God's clean earth they they consider slavery as
[03:39:15.360 --> 03:39:20.840]  stain and indelible stain on on on America and what they mean to do with
[03:39:20.840 --> 03:39:26.800]  this is to stop the will of Americans to defend themselves civilizations die
[03:39:26.800 --> 03:39:31.360]  when when they cease to believe in themselves if you think of America as a
[03:39:31.360 --> 03:39:39.040]  racist country in its origins and throughout its history you're not
[03:39:39.040 --> 03:39:43.760]  really gonna want to defend it are you I mean that's exactly what Barack Obama
[03:39:43.760 --> 03:39:49.160]  and racists like tiny he's the coast are saying all the time you see it
[03:39:49.160 --> 03:39:56.840]  everywhere the reality is that slavery existed in Africa for a thousand years
[03:39:56.840 --> 03:40:01.560]  before white people ever sit but they are white Americans did not go over to
[03:40:01.560 --> 03:40:08.480]  Africa and pro-nets overcooked the Kinti and kidnapped them and enslaved them
[03:40:08.480 --> 03:40:13.600]  they bought them a slave auction and of course it was the English who bought
[03:40:13.600 --> 03:40:20.120]  them a slave auction before we became the United States and you know ship them
[03:40:20.120 --> 03:40:27.360]  over here it's Thomas Jefferson putting into the our founding documents that all
[03:40:27.360 --> 03:40:34.320]  men are created equal and have the right the unalienable right to liberty that is
[03:40:34.320 --> 03:40:39.680]  the source of the freedom of the slave the truth is the historical truth is
[03:40:39.680 --> 03:40:45.280]  that black people and slave black people and white Americans liberated them at
[03:40:45.280 --> 03:40:54.160]  the cost of 350,000 you know their their lives against America are so deep and
[03:40:54.160 --> 03:41:02.400]  so unhistorical well why didn't we abolish slavery in 1776 well we were up
[03:41:02.400 --> 03:41:06.440]  against the greatest empire in the world and the southern states were
[03:41:06.440 --> 03:41:12.480]  committed to slavery the northern free space if they had insisted in the
[03:41:12.480 --> 03:41:16.960]  Constitution and an emancipation proclamation the south would have
[03:41:16.960 --> 03:41:22.400]  aligned with England and crushed the north and it still be slavery as a
[03:41:22.400 --> 03:41:31.360]  continent today I see David so why do you think that Obama's election did not
[03:41:31.360 --> 03:41:37.360]  herald a beacon of equality and freedom now we have a black president instead of
[03:41:37.360 --> 03:41:43.160]  Obama proclaiming America to be racist in nature and practice as Obama is the
[03:41:43.160 --> 03:41:48.200]  racist and a communist and that's been all his life that's the reason it's not
[03:41:48.200 --> 03:41:52.800]  Obama either it's this whole movement I mean the most celebrating author in
[03:41:52.800 --> 03:41:58.360]  America today it's time to use the coast he won the National Book Award in 2016
[03:41:58.360 --> 03:42:05.320]  he's a virulent anti-American racist who claim I mean aside from claiming that
[03:42:05.320 --> 03:42:13.040]  slavery and racism is so in America's DNA that will never be free of it which
[03:42:13.040 --> 03:42:18.720]  he has written so many words he says there can be not there's no black on
[03:42:18.720 --> 03:42:23.320]  black crime because white people are responsible for all black crime how
[03:42:23.320 --> 03:42:27.880]  lunatic is that he's an editor of the Atlantic monthly you've got him a
[03:42:27.880 --> 03:42:32.120]  car there a fellowship or six hundred thousand or whatever it is a genius

[03:46:54.720 --> 03:47:18.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show David Horowitz on the line coming to us
[03:47:18.440 --> 03:47:26.600]  also from California David you were an astute observer of the 2016 campaign I
[03:47:26.600 --> 03:47:31.280]  like you to talk about we're gonna show a short video of how Trump dealt with
[03:47:31.280 --> 03:47:36.360]  Hillary and the issue of progressives and race let's play that video we have a
[03:47:36.360 --> 03:47:40.920]  divided nation because people like her and believe me she has tremendous hate
[03:47:40.920 --> 03:47:47.360]  in her heart America must reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton who sees
[03:47:47.360 --> 03:47:53.640]  communities of color only his votes not as human beings worthy of a better
[03:47:53.640 --> 03:48:02.440]  future okay David so what did Trump tap into that other Republicans wouldn't
[03:48:02.440 --> 03:48:10.280]  even touch yeah Trump is the only Republican close to the truth about
[03:48:10.280 --> 03:48:17.280]  these things whereas the balls today a big problem you know the Democratic Party
[03:48:17.280 --> 03:48:22.480]  is a racist party and it's an anti-american party that's what liberals
[03:48:22.480 --> 03:48:28.000]  are these days Trump wants to have a military parade to celebrate the men and
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:34.640]  women who risk their lives to defend us and they call them a fascist that is so
[03:48:34.640 --> 03:48:39.880]  transparent these days of what these people are if there were if there were
[03:48:39.880 --> 03:48:46.040]  1.8 million white people here illegally you think that Chuck Schumer and Nancy
[03:48:46.040 --> 03:48:51.520]  Pelosi would be out there shutting down the government to try to get them in
[03:48:51.520 --> 03:49:00.040]  ridiculous there these are racist they are self-hating white people and and and
[03:49:00.040 --> 03:49:05.600]  out of control people of color nobody wants to criticize when they say racist
[03:49:05.600 --> 03:49:10.640]  things how is it that Tony easy coast can win a national book award be so
[03:49:10.640 --> 03:49:17.680]  celebrated when he's a raving racist in a book the central story in his book is
[03:49:17.680 --> 03:49:23.880]  a black friend of his was killed by a police officer the problem is that the
[03:49:23.880 --> 03:49:28.520]  police officer was black he said that that coach his friend was trying to run
[03:49:28.520 --> 03:49:34.420]  him over with his vehicle so how does coast explain it the black
[03:49:34.420 --> 03:49:39.840]  police was thinking white how way this is that I mean it's hard to get more
[03:49:39.840 --> 03:49:43.800]  racist than that if a black person does a bad thing it's because they're
[03:49:43.800 --> 03:49:51.040]  thinking white and you're David how could yeah how could these people David
[03:49:51.040 --> 03:49:55.000]  can you hear me I'm saying how did we come to the point where the Democrat
[03:49:55.000 --> 03:49:58.720]  leaders not just radicals on the street but the leaders are openly defaming
[03:49:58.720 --> 03:50:03.880]  America as a white supremacist society how did they revise the historical
[03:50:03.880 --> 03:50:12.680]  record but their party is captured captured by the left look I mean we we
[03:50:12.680 --> 03:50:17.360]  have a combination there there are crooks and communists right and the
[03:50:17.360 --> 03:50:23.920]  crooks have so fixed the elections you know I'm talking about Hillary and
[03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:29.680]  Dona Brazil and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that called me and ran in and all of them
[03:50:29.680 --> 03:50:37.880]  that old pack that Bernie Sanders was surprised you know being the candidate
[03:50:37.880 --> 03:50:44.000]  who's Bernie Sanders a lifelong communist supporter of Castro supporter of
[03:50:44.000 --> 03:50:50.480]  Stalin supporter of Brezhnev if you just go on and on that's who Bernie Sanders is
[03:50:50.480 --> 03:50:56.760]  he hasn't got a live brain cell in his head all he does is nail these
[03:50:56.760 --> 03:51:05.120]  communist prescriptions that's who the Democratic Party is do I think you know
[03:51:05.120 --> 03:51:09.800]  one is better days I mean I have nothing but contempt for Chuck Schumer and
[03:51:09.800 --> 03:51:16.800]  Nancy Pelosi is the communist but Schumer you know he's a politician but
[03:51:16.800 --> 03:51:21.840]  either didn't dare he doesn't dare say who to these people how could they let
[03:51:21.840 --> 03:51:29.720]  keep Ellis and a Muslim brotherhood racist black black Muslim racist as
[03:51:29.720 --> 03:51:36.160]  well serving Lewis Farrakhan the two-hater how can he be the deputy
[03:51:36.160 --> 03:51:40.600]  leader of the Democratic Party it's because the Democratic Party is gone
[03:51:40.600 --> 03:51:46.800]  now people have to recognize that and start fighting all right well David let's
[03:51:46.800 --> 03:51:51.760]  go I want to go to Steve in Florida he has a question for you about what can we
[03:51:51.760 --> 03:51:59.800]  do in the future what's the diagnosis let's go to Steve hi guys go ahead Steve
[03:51:59.800 --> 03:52:05.960]  question for David yeah it's great to listen to you guys because you got some
[03:52:05.960 --> 03:52:09.720]  really intelligent conversation going on here you know we're in such we're a
[03:52:09.720 --> 03:52:16.560]  state I feel like this country has been like a balloon is being blown up over
[03:52:16.560 --> 03:52:21.920]  the years over several years and finally when Donald Trump was elected that that
[03:52:21.920 --> 03:52:27.240]  bubble was popped and now all the dirt and the filth that was being injected
[03:52:27.240 --> 03:52:31.840]  into that balloon is now being released and you know you see the level of evil
[03:52:31.840 --> 03:52:37.080]  that is in this country right now it's all being exposed and it looks like it
[03:52:37.080 --> 03:52:42.760]  looks like these these globalists these Luciferians really are going to are
[03:52:42.760 --> 03:52:47.800]  going to fight back as hard as they can because they realize that if they don't
[03:52:47.800 --> 03:52:52.600]  they're done okay Steve thanks for the call David can you cut David go ahead
[03:52:52.600 --> 03:52:57.680]  and comment on where do you see the fight going from here given the fact that
[03:52:57.680 --> 03:53:02.240]  the Democrat Party is so radicalized people have to start calling things by
[03:53:02.240 --> 03:53:07.000]  their right names Democratic Party controls every inner city of size in
[03:53:07.000 --> 03:53:13.800]  America every killing field Chicago Detroit St. Louis Baltimore all 100%
[03:53:13.800 --> 03:53:18.400]  controlled by the Democratic Party and have been for 50 to 100 years every
[03:53:18.400 --> 03:53:24.200]  atrocity every oppression in the inner city these poor kids who go to schools
[03:53:24.200 --> 03:53:30.280]  that don't teach them because they're one for and by the adults and and they
[03:53:30.280 --> 03:53:35.080]  and they're all Democrats and they don't give a damn about black kids to catch
[03:53:35.080 --> 03:53:40.960]  and release a program which let's yeah I got suicidal criminals back on the
[03:53:40.960 --> 03:53:46.920]  streets to kill and kill again this has to be the Democratic Party is a racist
[03:53:46.920 --> 03:53:52.200]  party and Republicans I don't know any Republican who says that and when
[03:53:52.200 --> 03:53:56.640]  Trump is an ordinary pointed out because the carnage which is so obvious in the
[03:53:56.640 --> 03:54:02.800]  inner city the Democrats rallied around the carnage it said he's running down the
[03:54:02.800 --> 03:54:08.800]  inner city I mean it just there's got to be more people on our side who are
[03:54:08.800 --> 03:54:16.080]  willing to call things exactly the way they are that that's it means when I
[03:54:16.080 --> 03:54:22.600]  see Republicans calling Nancy Pelosi racist I'll be happy that I'll know
[03:54:22.600 --> 03:54:28.560]  where we're gonna win I see okay good another question from Florida let's go
[03:54:28.560 --> 03:54:35.840]  to Romeo question for David Horowitz please yeah well my question is about
[03:54:35.840 --> 03:54:43.240]  what do you think we know how evil the Democratic you know party is how you
[03:54:43.240 --> 03:54:49.280]  know they assassinate and murder like no problem and arc inside and you know the
[03:54:49.280 --> 03:54:53.640]  whole spiel what is going to be the next step for for these Democrats I mean
[03:54:53.640 --> 03:54:57.400]  obviously everyone thinks you know they're gonna attempt you know something
[03:54:57.400 --> 03:55:00.640]  on the president's life some type of attacker assassination you know obviously
[03:55:00.640 --> 03:55:05.560]  like JFK you know when things are going too good to be true you know it they
[03:55:05.560 --> 03:55:09.600]  they always go for that but you know that's gonna be so obvious so what is
[03:55:09.600 --> 03:55:14.640]  the next shooting drop for them what what else can they do who are they gonna
[03:55:14.640 --> 03:55:19.200]  be putting on the platform are they gonna run an independent that's a secret
[03:55:19.200 --> 03:55:23.480]  you know deep all right okay Romeo okay thanks for the call we don't have too
[03:55:23.480 --> 03:55:27.320]  much more time David what do you think of is Trump in danger how desperate
[03:55:27.320 --> 03:55:32.920]  will the Democrats become if Trump's economic program and his other policies
[03:55:32.920 --> 03:55:38.200]  are successful what will they do next well if they win the midterm elections
[03:55:38.200 --> 03:55:42.920]  they'll they'll try to impeach it that's what they're gonna do it's what's
[03:55:42.920 --> 03:55:48.120]  important is for people to get out and get organized and fight if you have
[03:55:48.120 --> 03:55:54.720]  money contribute it if you've got a voice raise it you know this battle is
[03:55:54.720 --> 03:55:59.640]  everywhere it's in our school our schools are completely now indoctrination

[03:56:42.720 --> 03:56:50.360]  compromise and so forth you really can't you know part of the problem now is the
[03:56:50.360 --> 03:56:57.200]  Republican Party that the McCain's and the Lindsey Crambs and that's a big
[03:56:57.200 --> 03:57:05.520]  problem people who don't understand that it's a war and you've been working for
