[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:43.400]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we are live on this Wednesday already the
[00:43.400 --> 00:51.260]  13th day of August 2014 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours I
[00:51.260 --> 00:57.680]  sent our reporters Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and Jacarie Jackson as well as
[00:57.680 --> 01:05.920]  our cameraman Josh Owens to Ferguson Missouri a suburb of St. Louis and just
[01:05.920 --> 01:13.960]  incredible video up on info wars.com and prismplanted.com of teargas riot police
[01:13.960 --> 01:21.640]  helicopters you name it and they also had live stream that was sent out as well
[01:21.640 --> 01:27.040]  last night we're gonna be playing some of those videos here today and Jacarie
[01:27.040 --> 01:33.720]  Jackson will be joining us with Joe Biggs coming up at the bottom of the
[01:33.720 --> 01:38.760]  hour federal snitch is on the scene stirring up race baiting as usual Al
[01:38.760 --> 01:48.200]  Sharpton he got confronted in Ferguson Missouri by reporters continuing FAA
[01:48.200 --> 01:52.480]  issues flight restriction after rioters fire multiple times at police
[01:52.480 --> 01:57.480]  helicopter police reportedly confronting four men with ski mask and
[01:57.480 --> 02:03.000]  shotguns another 20 people had a gun pulled on them they say and so they
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.120]  shot the suspect who's now dead that's what happened in the early morning hours
[02:09.120 --> 02:14.520]  our reporters on the ground gun sales are up across that area of Missouri in
[02:14.520 --> 02:22.400]  fears of wide-scale densified rioting Jesse Jackson went on to say that
[02:22.400 --> 02:28.160]  there's a Ferguson near you and that is my concern that Obama could use
[02:28.160 --> 02:32.880]  tragedies like this with along with Al Sharpton others to change the subject
[02:32.880 --> 02:41.360]  from the globalist destroying this country to the controlled demolition of
[02:41.360 --> 02:47.400]  the Republic they could change the subject from that and move it over into
[02:47.400 --> 02:54.400]  other issues like the ongoing racial and class division in this country
[02:54.400 --> 02:59.160]  anonymous has released the names address of wife and children of st. Louis
[02:59.160 --> 03:04.440]  County police chief I don't think you should ever bring people's children into
[03:04.440 --> 03:09.880]  things also again that dovetails of the police saying they won't release the name
[03:09.880 --> 03:18.320]  of the officer who reportedly started all of this whenever the 18-year-old
[03:18.320 --> 03:24.240]  black man was shot they claim in a scuffle inside the police car but have
[03:24.240 --> 03:28.960]  it shown the evidence and the crowds of people claim that during the
[03:28.960 --> 03:34.920]  altercation it was the police that shot the man who had his hands in the air I
[03:34.920 --> 03:40.200]  love to give the police the benefit of the doubt but historically we see so
[03:40.200 --> 03:47.600]  much covering of the booty by different government agencies in such a history of
[03:47.600 --> 03:51.720]  lying especially at the higher levels that I can't blame people for not
[03:51.720 --> 03:56.480]  believing it separately obviously you can't go around burning down buildings
[03:56.480 --> 04:02.840]  for no reason as your protest and stealing liquor so that discredits the
[04:02.840 --> 04:08.680]  whole thing right there so the situation is continuing to escalate with more
[04:08.680 --> 04:17.240]  riots and looting basically overnight we've got a lot of open border news where
[04:17.240 --> 04:22.520]  the judges are basically legalizing the illegals that will show up to the
[04:22.520 --> 04:26.240]  immigration hearings most the illegals simply just don't even show up to those
[04:26.240 --> 04:32.080]  of a big stack of news on that front also a weird coincidence Robin Williams
[04:32.080 --> 04:38.400]  Family Guide suicide episode aired before news of the actor's death the same
[04:38.400 --> 04:44.040]  night shocking TV viewers that stories up on drugsreport.com it's an in

[08:00.280 --> 08:20.480]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[08:30.280 --> 08:48.400]  welcome my friends to this live Wednesday the 13th day of August 2014
[08:48.400 --> 08:57.400]  global transmission while IS ISIS al Qaeda forces murder hundreds of thousands
[08:57.400 --> 09:02.800]  across Syria and Iraq over 300 plus thousand last four years in Syria
[09:02.800 --> 09:12.000]  everyone is freaking out over one dead 18 year old man in Ferguson a suburb of
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.680]  St. Louis, Missouri and police have now shot and critically wounded another
[09:17.680 --> 09:26.240]  suspect near Ferguson when they claimed they engaged four men wearing ski mask
[09:26.240 --> 09:31.720]  with shotguns with a crowd of 20 and then one of the men pulled a handgun so
[09:31.720 --> 09:38.200]  they shot him and you've got the White House FBI Justice Department
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.280]  technicians they're in the middle of it like Al Sharpton trying to stir things
[09:43.280 --> 09:51.720]  up I saw the video that's up on info wars.com of Al Sharpton we're going to
[09:51.720 --> 09:55.800]  see his whole body as he's walking with a woman holding his hand guiding a man
[09:55.800 --> 10:03.760]  there's a reason he looks like a reanimated corpse obviously Al Sharpton
[10:03.760 --> 10:12.120]  is not in good health we're showing some of the video now if you're watching us
[10:12.120 --> 10:16.280]  on the TV streams and info wars.com forward slash show but when he turns
[10:16.280 --> 10:22.560]  and walks you can see him from the side he looks like you know a zombie from a
[10:22.560 --> 10:30.840]  movie or something but the issue here is that the dollars being devalued
[10:30.840 --> 10:35.840]  globally gold is starting to go back up a little bit you've got major
[10:35.840 --> 10:40.960]  destabilization operations going on all over the planet you've got arms races
[10:40.960 --> 10:45.360]  starting between China and Japan you've got China threatening to invade
[10:45.360 --> 10:48.920]  different islands off the coast of Japan and the Philippines and threatening
[10:48.920 --> 10:54.240]  nuclear war if the US intervenes you've got NATO overthrowing Ukraine and
[10:54.240 --> 11:00.320]  major fighting and war intensifying over there we've got a member of
[11:00.320 --> 11:07.240]  parliament claiming Ebola virus has arrived in France India moles moving to
[11:07.240 --> 11:13.560]  the rubble for Russia trade and leaving the dollar you add that together with
[11:13.560 --> 11:20.200]  all these other countries that are doing it like China and Iran and Brazil and so
[11:20.200 --> 11:25.840]  many others this is the globalist maneuvering us towards the end of the
[11:25.840 --> 11:34.240]  dollar to bring in their new global SDR so that's some of the news we're gonna
[11:34.240 --> 11:41.000]  be breaking down today the Vatican has approved of Obama air strikes against
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.960]  IS and I have approved of those as well it says in a rare move the Vatican has
[11:47.960 --> 11:51.680]  said that they have to have intervention to save the Christians that are being
[11:51.680 --> 11:58.760]  slaughtered the problem is no one's bombing ISIS to stop the killing of
[11:58.760 --> 12:04.600]  Christians ISIS was created and set up in Syria and mainly does kill
[12:04.600 --> 12:09.400]  Christians that's incontrovertible fact 300 plus thousand dead at least 200
[12:09.400 --> 12:14.840]  thousand of them Christians Al Qaeda renaming itself ISIS and then IS to
[12:14.840 --> 12:20.560]  confuse TV viewers the confused Americans were starting to wake up to this if
[12:20.560 --> 12:30.680]  they find a Christian they kill them if they find a Jew they kill them when they
[12:30.680 --> 12:36.120]  when there's a real hijacking of an airplane they they kill the Christians
[12:36.120 --> 12:40.920]  in the Jews first I know it's caused to lab out there and really trendy to just
[12:40.920 --> 12:44.800]  hate Jews period you'll be following the banana pill Jews did it I understand
[12:44.800 --> 12:49.560]  that's the big trendy Hollywood thing my only issue is that's part of the
[12:49.560 --> 12:54.400]  radicalization and why you can't expect Israel to do peace deals when the the
[12:54.400 --> 12:58.960]  common denominator in the Middle East is kill every Jew you find well let's just
[12:58.960 --> 13:03.000]  move Jews off the table with all the trendies out there we understand you
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.680]  want them dead what about Christians who were doing nothing to anybody and
[13:07.680 --> 13:12.280]  aren't involved in Palestine and Gaza and the rest of it what about oh I
[13:12.280 --> 13:18.280]  understand it's not a cause so lab to talk about that because precious radical
[13:18.280 --> 13:23.040]  Muslims are doing it and you can't say that there's any Muslim on earth that
[13:23.040 --> 13:26.800]  is an extremist they're all perfect right that's the political correctness
[13:26.800 --> 13:36.720]  correct Vatican approves airstrike despite peace policy military action
[13:36.720 --> 13:41.720]  might be necessary says Vatican Ambassador United Nations hearing a
[13:41.720 --> 13:46.880]  genocide of Christians the Vatican has given its approval to US military
[13:46.880 --> 13:55.120]  airstrikes in Iraq a rare exception to its policy of peaceful conflict
[13:55.120 --> 14:01.600]  resolution the Holy See's ambassador the United Nations this weekend supported
[14:01.600 --> 14:05.640]  US airstrikes aimed at halting the advance of Sunni Islamic State IS
[14:05.640 --> 14:13.600]  militants calling for intervention now before it's too late and that action
[14:13.600 --> 14:18.760]  might be necessary the Vatican vocally disapprove of US lid campaign in Iraq
[14:18.760 --> 14:25.680]  and O3 and the 2013 plan for strikes in Syria and again I'm not a Vatican file
[14:25.680 --> 14:30.280]  I'm not even Catholic but when I see something good going on I gotta tell
[14:30.280 --> 14:35.560]  you I see it as good I think it's good that the Vatican was against attacking
[14:35.560 --> 14:41.960]  Libya Syria and the 2003 debacle which has killed hundreds of thousands more
[14:41.960 --> 14:48.840]  Iraqis any way you look at it and I'm against starting a war with Russia the
[14:48.840 --> 14:53.440]  Vatican's against that I'm against starting a war with Syria and turning
[14:53.440 --> 14:59.240]  it over to Al Qaeda the Vatican's against that now the Vatican promotes
[14:59.240 --> 15:05.040]  world government the EU and pantheistic stuff now which is very bad and I
[15:05.040 --> 15:09.080]  criticize that but see I don't I don't just criticize people whole hog or
[15:09.080 --> 15:14.440]  praise them whole hog when when something's good we pointed out you do
[15:14.440 --> 15:20.920]  not hear the mainline churches Protestant evangelical you name it in
[15:20.920 --> 15:25.440]  the United States criticizing the mass murder of Christians worldwide there is
[15:25.440 --> 15:31.480]  zero solidarity as Christians are killed in Asia Central Asia the Middle East
[15:31.480 --> 15:38.880]  Orthodox being killed in Eastern Europe you're hearing zero Africa you name it
[15:38.880 --> 15:45.200]  out of all these glitter bugs and meanwhile the Catholic Church along
[15:45.200 --> 15:48.960]  with the other faith-based state-run media and state-run religion here in the
[15:48.960 --> 15:53.920]  US is trying to bust the borders wide open and legalize all the illegals at
[15:53.920 --> 15:58.040]  taxpayers expense and the Catholic Church and others are getting up to $6,000
[15:58.040 --> 16:03.560]  or $2,000 for each person but they do it in 6,000 to $7,000 groups that's just
[16:03.560 --> 16:10.240]  how they do it for each group of three youth that are being stored so they're
[16:10.240 --> 16:15.920]  making money off of it that's why I'm against state-run religion because I
[16:15.920 --> 16:20.840]  don't want to bankroll religion with my tax money Congress shall make no law
[16:20.840 --> 16:26.280]  respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[16:26.280 --> 16:33.200]  thereof and so the Southern Baptist Convention and the Vatican have no
[16:33.200 --> 16:37.680]  business getting taxpayer money period to bust the illegals around the country
[16:37.680 --> 16:45.080]  or to be paid to keep them and to make money off of it I mean it's illegal for
[16:45.080 --> 16:49.040]  the churches to be involved in human smuggling to begin with the ancient
[16:49.040 --> 16:54.520]  argument is sanctuary though that predates the First Amendment that you
[16:54.520 --> 16:59.520]  if somebody ran into the cathedral and the church gave the person sanctuary the
[16:59.520 --> 17:04.200]  king couldn't even get him out of there aka the famous literary work of the
[17:04.200 --> 17:11.880]  hunchback of Notre Dame sanctuary sanctuary there's the headline this
[17:11.880 --> 17:16.120]  Baptist charity is being paid hundreds of millions to shelter child migrants
[17:16.120 --> 17:23.000]  time magazine see it's disgusting so when I criticize the Baptist or the
[17:23.000 --> 17:29.120]  Catholics for being state-run and helping destroy the country I don't do it
[17:29.120 --> 17:33.600]  out of hatred of Baptists or hatred of Catholics it's not some bigoted religious
[17:33.600 --> 17:39.880]  war it's I don't like you using my tax money to wreck my country and it's
[17:39.880 --> 17:44.800]  against the law what you're doing so see I go off and do compliment with one
[17:44.800 --> 17:48.440]  hand and attack with the other that's how my brain works I really try to know
[17:48.440 --> 17:54.440]  the policies I really try to know how stuff works and I'm sick of the Catholic
[17:54.440 --> 17:59.000]  Church promoting gun control in this country I'm gonna throw up the popes
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  got Swiss guards and private security with submachine guns and a pulp mobile
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.400]  do I get one of those no I don't it's my job to protect my family so now I'm
[18:09.400 --> 18:15.160]  gonna go off into a bashing of the Vatican Jag I just got to be honest
[18:15.160 --> 18:20.480]  about everything that's what I do Israel's doing some stuff that's wrong the
[18:20.480 --> 18:24.960]  Palestinians are doing some stuff that's wrong but I don't hear a word out of
[18:24.960 --> 18:28.640]  the Palestinians who always arrogantly send me emails that I should you know
[18:28.640 --> 18:32.040]  call for destruction of Israel when I'm out here in Jack's squad out of you
[18:32.040 --> 18:35.960]  about the Christians how about I hear something out of you about Christians
[18:35.960 --> 18:39.120]  that aren't doing anything to you and have been there for thousands of years
[18:39.120 --> 18:43.880]  before Muhammad showed up how about I hear from Muslims about not killing
[18:43.880 --> 18:50.640]  Christians if you're not radical about that how about I hear about you
[18:50.640 --> 18:57.160]  criticizing IS no I'm I'm getting threatened by IS websites they're allowed

[24:31.560 --> 24:39.200]  break one of our reporters and said Alex I tried to share last night at like
[24:39.200 --> 24:44.840]  midnight our videos of the riot police and helicopters and tear gas with our
[24:44.840 --> 24:49.720]  reporters the live feeds that had then been archived he tried to share those
[24:49.720 --> 24:56.200]  videos in an article on Facebook and it said no you're not allowed to share this
[24:56.200 --> 25:07.000]  on our official big Facebook with 800 plus thousand followers and we're just
[25:07.000 --> 25:13.360]  getting emails pouring in about folks that aren't able to share information
[25:13.360 --> 25:21.240]  but it's second amendment info or it's riot info or it's police info and I
[25:21.240 --> 25:24.960]  meant to cover this more yesterday when you guys pull it out of the stack the
[25:24.960 --> 25:31.280]  big headline that the bill is now passed in California to make all cell phone
[25:31.280 --> 25:36.520]  manufacturers have police and governmental commandeering kill switches in
[25:36.520 --> 25:41.320]  them so they can turn off your phones whenever they want now this software is
[25:41.320 --> 25:45.840]  already in most phones but now that it's the law in California is the biggest
[25:45.840 --> 25:51.320]  market this will force globally this to be adopted there's the headline kill
[25:51.320 --> 25:56.520]  switch smartphone bill passes in California remember I told you six seven
[25:56.520 --> 26:02.160]  years ago the plan was to allow music venues you name it to have a kill switch
[26:02.160 --> 26:06.120]  so you can't videotape the music that was the excuse and Apple already put that
[26:06.120 --> 26:11.680]  on all their new phones droid already has it now they're just passing laws to
[26:11.680 --> 26:18.120]  then next say it's illegal to have a cell phone working this is how draconian
[26:18.120 --> 26:24.560]  and authoritarian and totalitarian things are getting that people pretty soon
[26:24.560 --> 26:28.200]  won't even most folks won't even have cameras or the new cameras that are
[26:28.200 --> 26:33.480]  coming out I've been the best buy our wireless have an internet chip in them
[26:33.480 --> 26:42.360]  and have GPS and the cameras like 250 bucks and it's 20 megapixel and then I'm
[26:42.360 --> 26:46.720]  like well let me get something cheaper oh sorry they all have GPS now and a
[26:46.720 --> 26:51.080]  chip so I looked at the owner's manual looked it up online a few months ago and
[26:51.080 --> 26:54.200]  I was looking at cameras for the office some smaller ones so we'd have some
[26:54.200 --> 26:58.480]  side units all the reporters could carry them with them at all times even when
[26:58.480 --> 27:03.400]  they're you know off work because that's when you tend to catch stuff and I
[27:03.400 --> 27:07.440]  looked it up and basically everything not just your thermostat or your
[27:07.440 --> 27:11.680]  dishwasher or your smartphone everything's having the smart technology
[27:11.680 --> 27:16.240]  put in it where they'll just kill everything they put a code in with all
[27:16.240 --> 27:19.960]  these police wireless networks that Homeland Security's paid for and it
[27:19.960 --> 27:25.800]  shuts everything down this is the premeditated criminal totalitarian take
[27:25.800 --> 27:32.600]  over and speaking of that it's up on info wars.com William Benning number four
[27:32.600 --> 27:37.880]  at the NSA who was on the show two weeks ago saying that it's a total police
[27:37.880 --> 27:43.760]  state takeover of America and the world to end freedom now Snowden has come out
[27:43.760 --> 27:52.440]  Steve Watson article info wars.com there's a holy bleep moment smoking gun

[28:03.520 --> 28:08.640]  a real high-level leaker because a lot of what he's put out was already known if
[28:08.640 --> 28:13.440]  this is all for real on the up and up it isn't a deep level psi-op and I'm not
[28:13.440 --> 28:19.640]  saying it is I think Snowden's probably real if this is the real deal we know

[38:17.680 --> 38:22.440]  the wide open borders people say well Facebook is Zuckerberg's business it's
[38:22.440 --> 38:28.040]  his pump and dump it's his fraud let him do it they advertise as you bring your
[38:28.040 --> 38:32.600]  info your photos your information that's what gives it value you follow their
[38:32.600 --> 38:37.720]  terms of use and then they go and cheat you and and claim you're violating them
[38:37.720 --> 38:41.840]  and that you are violent or an extremist when clearly that wouldn't hold up in a
[38:41.840 --> 38:46.720]  court of law and start blocking you sharing your pro-second amendment ideas
[38:46.720 --> 38:52.560]  or information just like banks everywhere aren't letting sporting goods stores
[38:52.560 --> 38:59.320]  that even sell ammo have bank accounts anymore that is economic siege that's
[38:59.320 --> 39:06.160]  what Hitler did the first seven years he was in power from 1933 to 1940 before
[39:06.160 --> 39:11.600]  he started rounding everybody up in mass this is classic totalitarianism to
[39:11.600 --> 39:16.440]  use a managed centralized economy to shut down anybody they don't agree with
[39:16.440 --> 39:23.040]  and it's the opposite of liberalness and inclusiveness and a pluralistic
[39:23.040 --> 39:35.400]  society it's a fraud and so we have info wars calm and prison planet calm our
[39:35.400 --> 39:39.640]  own websites that get attacked and they try to hack and all sorts of other
[39:39.640 --> 39:43.960]  dirty tricks I won't go into and we have prison planet TV so you can see the
[39:43.960 --> 39:48.400]  nightly news see all the films archived in HD so when we do get censored you've
[39:48.400 --> 39:54.760]  got something to fall back to and we do have other platforms and the films on
[39:54.760 --> 39:59.080]  DVD and Blu-ray so you can have them in your archive down the road if the
[39:59.080 --> 40:04.360]  censorship gets worse and you also when you buy the books the videos the films

[40:32.000 --> 40:36.520]  support that's why we're having 10% off until next Monday for the back to

[41:39.520 --> 41:46.840]  and if we get more funds we are going to be able to hire even more reporters so
[41:46.840 --> 41:50.520]  we're not short staffed here with the nightly news and the radio show and the
[41:50.520 --> 41:58.120]  filmmaking and the special reports when I send jacari Jackson and Josh Owens and
[41:58.120 --> 42:03.760]  Joe Biggs to st. Louis Missouri and Ferguson to give you the hardcore on
[42:03.760 --> 42:08.360]  the ground reporting in a war zone but people getting killed of what's
[42:08.360 --> 42:14.560]  happening I want to hire more reporters I need to hire at least five more I want
[42:14.560 --> 42:19.240]  to be able to send reporters all over the world that's what's gonna happen give
[42:19.240 --> 42:25.360]  you by the products like x2 from info wars life that I take morning noon and
[42:25.360 --> 42:31.560]  night and is the proprietary super iodine from deep earth crystals that no
[42:31.560 --> 42:39.120]  one else has info wars life.com and I take it with the super male vitality
[42:39.120 --> 42:43.000]  morning noon and night and it has made me so much more virile with these
[42:43.000 --> 42:51.000]  concentrated organic herbs that have been cold-pressed literally our super
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.360]  male super female vitality are better than the leading competitors that are
[42:54.360 --> 43:02.520]  $100 for basically half the price. I know our leading competitors make their
[43:02.520 --> 43:07.200]  stuff that actually works because it's herbs it's just dry herbs for like $5
[43:07.200 --> 43:12.520]  and sell it for a hundred it cost us 20 20 something bucks and we sell it for 50
[43:12.520 --> 43:17.040]  yeah there's a mark up there it funds the operation you get the best quality at
[43:17.040 --> 43:22.160]  the lowest price and our herbs don't mimic testosterone and other hormones
[43:22.160 --> 43:25.280]  they get your body to release them according to the research group and
[43:25.280 --> 43:33.840]  others that put out all I know is it works info wars life.com and they're
[43:33.840 --> 43:38.000]  trying to censor us at every level folks so don't take the fact that we have a
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.560]  Facebook or a Twitter for granted don't take info wars for granted don't take
[43:42.560 --> 43:47.280]  drugs report or world net daily for granted don't take talk radio for
[43:47.280 --> 43:51.600]  granted they're trying to bring in the fairness doctrine again they're sitting
[43:51.600 --> 44:00.520]  again this is real totalitarianism I know you know that now we take you live
[44:00.520 --> 44:06.000]  to Ferguson Missouri on the outskirts of st. Louis where since last Saturday night
[44:06.000 --> 44:11.760]  when a black man 18 year old young man was shot dead witnesses said with his
[44:11.760 --> 44:15.320]  hands up police say inside the police car basically but they haven't shown the
[44:15.320 --> 44:20.280]  evidence of that yet haven't released the officer's name again I just have to
[44:20.280 --> 44:25.560]  hold back on judgment because we don't know yet but I don't trust the system
[44:25.560 --> 44:28.600]  obviously I also don't trust a bunch of looters running around burning things
[44:28.600 --> 44:34.000]  down and you know saying that's how you protest is that discredits any any real
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.840]  protest if people would have defended themselves if people see cops shooting
[44:37.840 --> 44:41.400]  innocent people that's another thing I would support that but Jacari Jackson
[44:41.400 --> 44:44.840]  joins us he's been there since yesterday evening working throughout the night
[44:44.840 --> 44:51.040]  doing it just an incredible job with Joe Biggs and Josh Owens Jacari tell us
[44:51.040 --> 44:55.000]  what you witnessed there you're right in front of the mini mark that's burned
[44:55.000 --> 45:00.240]  down right behind you Jacari a pretty incredible videos you filed last night
[45:00.240 --> 45:05.240]  tell us what you saw thank you jacari jackson reporting for n4wars.com now as
[45:05.240 --> 45:08.680]  you alluded to we are in Ferguson Missouri the site will rise broke out
[45:08.680 --> 45:13.000]  over the weekend following the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown
[45:13.000 --> 45:16.960]  now the reports of contradictory but even if the official police narrative is
[45:16.960 --> 45:21.000]  true and that's a big if that after a scuffle with Brown the police chase them
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.880]  down there having shot him then shot him again multiple times while he was
[45:24.880 --> 45:28.600]  fleeing you can't shoot an unarmed suspect especially one that's running away
[45:28.600 --> 45:32.440]  from you so there's some big concerns about that wow that's been confirmed boy
[45:32.440 --> 45:36.240]  they're trying to cut I didn't know that well that's the story that's the story
[45:36.240 --> 45:38.640]  that they're giving we don't know exactly what happened you know the people
[45:38.640 --> 45:42.520]  were saying that he wasn't even having a confrontation with the police he pretty
[45:42.520 --> 45:45.960]  much had his hands up as we saw last night the peaceful protesters we didn't
[45:45.960 --> 45:49.480]  we encountered saying hands up don't shoot so like said the reports of
[45:49.480 --> 45:53.560]  contradictory at this point so we came out here last night and days prior we
[45:53.560 --> 45:56.240]  had known about the riots and all the things going on you could see the
[45:56.240 --> 45:59.720]  evidence of some of the riots behind me this is the quick trip store that was
[45:59.720 --> 46:03.160]  burned horrifically I don't know if they have plans to open this facility again
[46:03.160 --> 46:08.000]  wouldn't blame them if they never did so this place was vandalized people looting
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.720]  people stealing the ATM out of this facility and I'm sure many of our viewers
[46:11.720 --> 46:14.680]  have now seen the the gentleman saying that hey this is what you're supposed
[46:14.680 --> 46:17.880]  to do when the police come and bring violence to your community I just agree
[46:17.880 --> 46:21.160]  with that people are lashing out they're angry they have the right to be angry
[46:21.160 --> 46:25.160]  but you don't submit that anger to your own community you don't say I'm out of
[46:25.160 --> 46:28.120]  the cops so let's go burn down the mini mark right around the corner you know
[46:28.120 --> 46:32.000]  that's a completely dumb thing to do but the people we met last night they were
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.080]  largely peaceful you know they had some harsh words for the police but they
[46:35.080 --> 46:38.520]  weren't being physically violent and the police responded maybe we can get a shot
[46:38.520 --> 46:41.960]  turn around to show you where the police blockade was right where you see the
[46:41.960 --> 46:45.960]  camera aimed right now that's where the police blockade was they had the big
[46:45.960 --> 46:50.320]  military type vehicles the guys out here with the riot shields the heavy armor
[46:50.320 --> 46:54.120]  the snipers on top of the vehicle and that's the thing I want to talk about
[46:54.120 --> 46:57.800]  Alex because we were out here as I said many of the people well most of the
[46:57.800 --> 47:02.240]  people were calm calm people you did have some people yelling slurs at the
[47:02.240 --> 47:05.560]  officers and so forth and so for some reason some guy thought it would be a
[47:05.560 --> 47:09.040]  good idea to throw a water bottle at the police and things got hot for a second
[47:09.040 --> 47:12.800]  but quickly cooled down but talking about the sniper there was a sniper on top
[47:12.800 --> 47:16.720]  of one of these vehicles aiming a loaded gun at people who were standing in the
[47:16.720 --> 47:20.680]  street with our hands up we released that video on info wars comm and I was
[47:20.680 --> 47:23.840]  doing my rounds in the mainstream media today and I see anybody talking about the
[47:23.840 --> 47:27.760]  sniper putting red dots on your chest if you dare stand into a street that was
[47:27.760 --> 47:31.280]  blocked off from both that is huge and we have video of this I mean I would get
[47:31.280 --> 47:35.720]  mad if a red dot was on me and I was yeah and I didn't have a weapon and I
[47:35.720 --> 47:39.320]  wasn't threatening people one time I was protesting the Klan we have video of
[47:39.320 --> 47:44.280]  this and I was sitting there in a t-shirt and blue jeans with my camera guy
[47:44.280 --> 47:49.120]  Mike Hansen and they said look at the parking garage and the cops the sheriff
[47:49.120 --> 47:55.800]  department had their rifles aimed at me so I guess it's just this form of
[47:55.800 --> 48:00.680]  intimidation did they aim a rifle at Ujikari well they were aiming rifles you
[48:00.680 --> 48:03.360]  all guys I don't know how well you can see on the iPhone but we do have some
[48:03.360 --> 48:07.440]  high-deaf footage that's coming up soon on info wars comm guys hiding behind the
[48:07.440 --> 48:11.040]  big military vehicles aiming guns at the crowd I didn't personally get a red dot
[48:11.040 --> 48:14.640]  on my chest but you know maybe I looked you know too professional for them to do
[48:14.640 --> 48:17.440]  that is that we don't want to intimidate the reporters and another thing I want
[48:17.440 --> 48:20.960]  to talk about the misinformation the compartmentalization of the police
[48:20.960 --> 48:24.360]  themselves as I said we have the blockade over here but there is also a
[48:24.360 --> 48:28.800]  blockade further down the street on West full resident and the officers had
[48:28.800 --> 48:31.720]  that blocked off as well and I said officer can we go down the street he
[48:31.720 --> 48:35.120]  said you can walk down the street you just can't drive we don't want any car
[48:35.120 --> 48:38.760]  traffic we said fine and also asked the officer I said is there a PIO or
[48:38.760 --> 48:42.000]  somebody else I can talk to he said yeah go down the street pass the quick
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.840]  trip the PIOs down there I said great so we walked down the street and I tried
[48:45.840 --> 48:48.800]  to approach the officers but as I already pointed out if you got anywhere
[48:48.800 --> 48:51.960]  near the police who are all hiding behind the big military vehicles they
[48:51.960 --> 48:55.600]  pointed a red dot at you so okay go down there and talk to the PIO who's hiding
[48:55.600 --> 48:59.560]  behind the you know the snipers and the red dots and all that stuff and that's
[48:59.560 --> 49:03.240]  how they're pretty much silencing the the media here and we talked to other
[49:03.240 --> 49:06.760]  journalists here as well local journalists people from other affiliates
[49:06.760 --> 49:09.640]  and they said yeah pretty much if we can't get a statement they won't let
[49:09.640 --> 49:12.640]  us talk to us we even saw a couple journalists out here with with body
[49:12.640 --> 49:17.240]  armor so I guess they expected things to get to get pretty hot well police have
[49:17.240 --> 49:21.920]  been hurt I know a helicopter reportedly got shot at but I mean this is like an
[49:21.920 --> 49:26.520]  occupying army and I'm not just trying to bash the police but come on black
[49:26.520 --> 49:30.880]  armored vehicles pointing red dots at reporters and people that is outrageous
[49:30.880 --> 49:35.720]  and I would get I mean I'm just telling people I would get very upset if I'm
[49:35.720 --> 49:40.120]  standing there with my hands up and the cops are aiming red dots at my chest
[49:40.120 --> 49:44.160]  hiding behind armored vehicles like total cowards I mean they shouldn't have
[49:44.160 --> 49:48.040]  got into this profession if they're just running around basically going to the
[49:48.040 --> 49:52.120]  bathroom and their pants at the side of a bunch of teenagers I mean this is
[49:52.120 --> 49:55.840]  crazy right and as you saw the videos last night people got down in the street
[49:55.840 --> 49:59.800]  walking around with their hands up you know even got down on the ground not
[49:59.800 --> 50:03.520]  so much in a submission but showing their solidarity a protest we're not out
[50:03.520 --> 50:07.400]  here yeah protesters not the looters we saw looters and they passed but nobody
[50:07.400 --> 50:10.840]  was looting last night at least in our area and people said hey you know we're
[50:10.840 --> 50:14.600]  out here we're being strong we're just trying to show
[50:14.600 --> 50:21.560]  again the miracle of skype is with us but jacarys video very crisp video of
[50:21.560 --> 50:25.720]  your TV viewer just cut out we're gonna reconnect with him and then we're gonna
[50:25.720 --> 50:32.360]  let him continue on with his excellent a break down and then we're going to

[50:37.200 --> 50:41.880]  military perspective that sergeant retired on this but I mean I tell you
[50:41.880 --> 50:48.080]  cops pointing their rifles with red dots at you I know with different state
[50:48.080 --> 50:52.680]  laws and things unless you think you're an imminent threat and the individual is
[50:52.680 --> 50:58.320]  brandishing a weapon the point loaded gun at him is violates the use of force I
[50:58.320 --> 51:02.520]  think it's extreme this is an alert if your business or church is building this

[53:24.560 --> 53:30.560]  TV it simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home and
[53:30.560 --> 53:34.560]  when burglars think someone is home watching television they're likely to
[53:34.560 --> 53:38.960]  pass your house and move on to an easier target the new brighter fake TV is
[53:38.960 --> 53:46.040]  only 3995 and includes free shipping go to fake TV dot com or call 1-877-5
[53:46.040 --> 53:56.240]  fake TV that's 877-532-5388 or go to fake TV dot com fake TV the burglar
[53:56.240 --> 54:20.760]  detour it again you're listening to live global coverage of what Jesse Jackson
[54:20.760 --> 54:28.040]  says could go nationwide Ferguson nights of rioting and some looting and the
[54:28.040 --> 54:35.400]  police now are basically keeping the media out and aiming rifle laser scopes at
[54:35.400 --> 54:43.360]  people's chest I guess is an attempt at intimidation and another individual they
[54:43.360 --> 54:51.720]  claim that was pointed a handgun at him got shot last night and the real problem
[54:51.720 --> 54:54.760]  here this will be used as a political diversion away from everything else
[54:54.760 --> 54:58.480]  Obama's doing getting communities just to fight with each other
[54:58.480 --> 55:04.280]  jacari Jackson of course two years ago the regular army trained for martial law
[55:04.280 --> 55:11.120]  in different areas of st. Louis and surrounding suburbs have any of the
[55:11.120 --> 55:15.920]  locals brought that up or what is their sense of what happened and how long do
[55:15.920 --> 55:19.720]  you think this could go on well I think it will continue to be like said it's
[55:19.720 --> 55:23.000]  been going on since I guess Sunday or so and there are a lot of people out here
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.000]  last night and people said they're going to keep coming so we'll try to be out
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.680]  here tonight as well their sense of it you know they view it as general police
[55:29.680 --> 55:33.080]  brutality they say this thing happens all too often in their community
[55:33.080 --> 55:36.200]  especially if you know if their side of the story is true that Michael Brown
[55:36.200 --> 55:40.160]  posed no threat and I definitely believe that's possible walking around with his
[55:40.160 --> 55:43.400]  hands up you know didn't want to be in a confrontation with the police and also
[55:43.400 --> 55:46.320]  people did recognize they say you know this is a police state we encountered
[55:46.320 --> 55:49.920]  several individuals last night on our u-stream who knew about their their
[55:49.920 --> 55:53.080]  bill of rights who recognized they had a First Amendment right who recognized
[55:53.080 --> 55:56.920]  this is police state that you don't need all these police officers out here in
[55:56.920 --> 55:59.960]  such a way I understand the police side of it you know that you've had rights
[55:59.960 --> 56:02.880]  you know they burned down this building I understand why you want to have a
[56:02.880 --> 56:07.040]  police presence out here but the big military vehicles aiming a sniper at
[56:07.040 --> 56:11.240]  somebody's chest that is completely over the top and I think you know somebody
[56:11.240 --> 56:14.920]  needs to address that at the police department to say why they felt it was
[56:14.920 --> 56:18.840]  necessary to aim a sniper rifle at somebody who's walking in the street
[56:18.840 --> 56:23.240]  with their hands up yeah I think you guys should go down to the police
[56:23.240 --> 56:26.760]  department and follow complaint that you witnessed unarmed people with their
[56:26.760 --> 56:31.120]  hands up exercising their First Amendment while police from concealment
[56:31.120 --> 56:35.240]  aimed I know your firearms guys maybe you know what type of rifle or handgun it
[56:35.240 --> 56:40.720]  was jacari but we do have video of this and I would get upset by guys up on the
[56:40.720 --> 56:46.640]  dash of a vehicle up on the hood of an m-wrap these homeland security vehicles
[56:46.640 --> 56:50.960]  that were in Iraq aiming it at your chest and they're like oh we didn't shoot a
[56:50.960 --> 56:55.720]  guy with his hands up but now you've got your hands up that and so we're gonna
[56:55.720 --> 56:59.960]  aim a rifle at your chest I mean maybe they mow down a bunch of people right
[56:59.960 --> 57:03.920]  there they'll just claim you were on the back of a police car jacar maybe they
[57:03.920 --> 57:08.560]  kill you they'll they'll claim you assaulted them yeah I mean it's
[57:08.560 --> 57:11.680]  completely ridiculous like you can see clearly in the videos there's a good
[57:11.680 --> 57:14.840]  distance between everybody and the police officer especially the guy who
[57:14.840 --> 57:17.960]  had his hands up in the street probably get a hundred yards away from me
[57:17.960 --> 57:22.240]  officer at least that and the guys aiming the rifle at his chest and I
[57:22.240 --> 57:25.760]  definitely want to point out to people this is what they use to justify the
[57:25.760 --> 57:29.240]  police state this is what they use to justify the m-wraps and the heavy armor
[57:29.240 --> 57:32.120]  and the snipers they say look what happened in Ferguson so that's why we
[57:32.120 --> 57:35.520]  need all these big armored trucks that's why we need all these other armaments to
[57:35.520 --> 57:39.400]  to stop situations like that so you know just to anybody out there definitely
[57:39.400 --> 57:42.880]  be peaceful there's a right way to protest there's a wrong way to loot and
[57:42.880 --> 57:45.920]  you don't want to do that you don't want to give them any excuse to have the
[57:45.920 --> 57:48.960]  things that they have that's right you're supposed to loot like the foreign
[57:48.960 --> 57:54.560]  Federal Reserve with tens of trillions and banker bailouts that's okay but if
[57:54.560 --> 57:58.600]  you get mad and a few thugs take advantage of the police covering a
[57:58.600 --> 58:02.800]  protest you know the rob a store well let's blame everybody for that again
[58:02.800 --> 58:05.720]  it's two separate events what really happened with the young man needs to be
[58:05.720 --> 58:10.200]  looked at investigated we don't endorse the looting either but we don't endorse
[58:10.200 --> 58:16.160]  police aiming lasers at peaceful men women and children's chest playing army
[58:16.160 --> 58:20.920]  it's just it's just such a joke god jacari we're gonna come back we're gonna
[58:20.920 --> 58:27.360]  come back and talk to jacari jackson from Ferguson Missouri right outside
[58:27.360 --> 58:33.600]  st. Louis and then we're gonna talk to Joe Biggs and get his perspective maybe
[58:33.600 --> 58:37.880]  walk up get some closer shots of the burned out buildings second hour coming
[58:37.880 --> 58:42.960]  up stay with us all we're offering the truth folks nothing more prison planet
[58:42.960 --> 58:53.400]  dot TV from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world
[58:53.400 --> 58:57.320]  is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[58:57.320 --> 59:01.320]  outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[59:01.320 --> 59:05.560]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[59:05.560 --> 59:09.400]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[59:09.400 --> 59:13.560]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[59:13.560 --> 59:17.320]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[59:17.320 --> 59:20.720]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[59:20.720 --> 59:24.400]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[59:24.400 --> 59:28.800]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[59:28.800 --> 59:32.640]  cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild

[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.640]  final segment with jacarie jackson on the aftermath of another night of
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.920]  demonstrations no looting that he saw another death police shot someone else
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:48.840]  dead and I tell you it doesn't look good having the police all behind armored
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:56.640]  vehicles pointing laser scopes at people's chest when no police have been
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:04.240]  assaulted I know a helicopter got shot at they say but it's easy for people to
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.080]  shoot some blanks off as a false flag and I will tell you police departments do
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.280]  that to gain what they see the propaganda upper hand this is all part of
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:16.760]  this Machiavellian world where everybody engages in BS not me folks I just want to
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:21.960]  be a straight shooter and try to find out the truth because the crowds can lie
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.480]  too and say you know they shot an unarmed man except so many times the cops say
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:30.360]  oh no he pulled a gun on us he attacked us and then you see the video and the
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:36.320]  guys in handcuffs on the ground they shoot him in the back or the cops say a
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.640]  homeless guys attacking him and you see the video and he's on the ground with
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:44.240]  eight cops sitting on him beating his brains out you know I just seen too much
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:50.840]  of that and you get a lot of cops on steroids and they're all militarized and
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:57.040]  they want to be in a fight they're all dressed up nowhere to go and it's just a
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.880]  bad scenario because you turn into a military you hit the public like an
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:04.600]  enemy the public start treating you like an enemy and then all the armored
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:08.560]  vehicles and all the camo in the world when the globalist stage of false flag
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:15.640]  and point the military and the police at the American people veterans and gun
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:20.120]  owners and libertarians and conservatives and Christians don't fight back
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:25.680]  burning down mini-marts just everybody knows we don't fight back blowing up
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:31.160]  federal buildings like the feds did in 95 to blame us we fight back exposing the
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:36.280]  names of people that did blow it up and we will defend ourselves and the
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:40.440]  American people will absolutely kick the butt of the paramilitary police and
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:44.280]  military if they're dumb enough to start a fight with us but that's the plan is
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.960]  that stage civil war which will then wipe out the police and military to bring
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:54.760]  in the next wave just like they've done in Iraq Iraq is the model of the US a
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:00.280]  20-year protracted deindustrialization civil war breakdown and final
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:05.760]  invasion of UN globalist forces as saviors
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.120]  jacari you've done a great job and you're gonna follow more HD reports for
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.200]  the nightly news tonight but other points of the two minutes we've got left
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.560]  before we come back and talk to Joe Biggs yeah we'll just go ahead and get
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.560]  started Alex showing you a little bit of the surroundings out here of this
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.800]  quick trip that was burned down you can see first of all this is the sign right
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:28.520]  here you can see the holes in the sign also the spray paint on the sign I don't
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.720]  know how well you can make it out but it says snitches that somebody spray painted
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.280]  and it was my understanding that some of the earlier rioters and looters thought
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.840]  that's quick trip at snitch to the police it's my understanding that that
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.800]  never happened just you know another excuse to do any means necessary to
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:49.000]  burn down Al Sharpton's hotel cuz he's a FBI snitch well actually I heard it
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.840]  that somebody even asked him if he was an FBI informant so yeah there's no
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.240]  what they think about it let's look at some of this you can see some of the
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:03.560]  spray painted graffiti it's all been covered over the pumps over here and
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.200]  there's even graffiti on the ground in some places didn't it say kill pigs
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:12.400]  before oh yeah further on down the street we saw a sign so my spray pants
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:17.080]  that die pigs die so they're definitely very angry at the police we'll get here
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:21.360]  closer to the to the quick trip now it's very sad to me because quick trip
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.920]  started in Oklahoma and to see this happen to one of their facilities is
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.880]  very disheartening but hopefully they'll look at this and try to remedy the
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:33.240]  situation just to make sure these things don't happen again but as you can see
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:39.840]  all the damage here come back and finish your report with the video feed you've
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.960]  got and then we're going to talk to Joe big stay there and you can hand the

[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:36.480]  vehicles that police departments are getting from the Pentagon aiming their
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:42.320]  rifles with laser sights on people's chest who are completely peaceful
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:50.320]  absolutely outrageous how militarized this country has gotten simply simply
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:56.640]  unbelievable but meanwhile the military and the police and the
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:02.160]  war patrol are told to run from the Mexican cartels when they shoot at them
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:05.360]  and they're allowed to kill whoever they want the border is basically wide
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:12.440]  open but if you try to protest in America you are el diablo coming up

[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:16.120]  shows the total bull here's another report ATF's proposed 48 hour lost gun
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:20.800]  reporting rules sparks industry backlash where they get to arrest or lock up gun

[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:34.160]  your job and you go to jail outside of law just want to change regulations so
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:41.520]  they can lock you up in their dungeon and by the way page six is reporting

[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:09.360]  learned you're a prisoner the God is here and of course the wealthy golfers at
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:16.040]  one of the most elitist golf clubs in the world the Vineyard Golf Club were
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.920]  gobsmacked when President Obama unexpectedly strolled on to a nearby
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:25.320]  green and they were immediately frisk there was no warning he was coming oh
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.920]  the Emperor oh you thought you lived in a free country
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:37.600]  meanwhile Saddam Hussein could stand around with 10,000 people with AK-47s
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:42.760]  shooting them in the air and no one was shooting but when a general goes around
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.720]  our own military is disarmed that's because they know they're an enemy
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:51.560]  operation literally squatting on us praying on us and they're total cowards
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.040]  and they know they've committed incredible crimes and they think everyone's
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.560]  out to get them and out to kill them I don't want anything to happen to the
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.600]  pathetic puppet Obama because we're not gonna let them rehabilitate him
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:06.720]  politically and have Hillary distance herself we're gonna just wreck him
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:11.360]  politically wreck her we're gonna just pile on all their crimes and they're
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:16.960]  gonna be poster boys and girls for the kleptocratic fake liberal pseudo
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:23.960]  intellectual hardcore vicious un-American fascist anti-free speech dirt bag

[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:35.560]  commandeering phones and making announcements and their passing bills to
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.880]  kill switch all your electronics whenever they want I mean it is just over
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:45.440]  the top this technocracy they've built and have denied building I'm gonna
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:48.880]  speculate on what the big snow and revelations are I know what the NSA is
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:52.160]  already doing so I'm gonna break that down at the bottom of the hour and take
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.160]  your phone calls I want to get your take on all the news we've been covering
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.480]  today open phones long-time callers first-time callers people that agree
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:06.440]  disagree got a question got a comment eight hundred two five nine ninety two
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:12.040]  thirty one eight hundred two five and nine ninety two thirty one we've got
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:17.760]  this big stinking illegitimate facade that's stealing everything not nailed
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.680]  down totally trying to screw society up so we're too stupid and confused to
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:27.720]  realize that they're robbing us it's like they set a fire across town at the
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:33.920]  school so they can rob the bank that's a military tactic to have the fog of war
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:39.840]  to confound them I remember reading old naval logs that were republished years
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:44.560]  ago find them fascinating actual logs of battles and stuff but they would also
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.320]  have the prayers the British Navy would say about you know we pray Lord you
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:52.200]  confound and confuse the enemy and that are different distractions and
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:56.640]  diversions might be accepted by them and that you guide us with total focus and
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:02.000]  precision and dedication to smash the enemy and have victory or in failure
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.680]  still know the great glory of the service against our enemies in basically
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:11.640]  paraphrasing it and that's the prayers they say at skull and bones that's the
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:17.240]  prayers they say in MSNBC as they salute foreign flag officers I mean this is a
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:24.960]  mechanized operation but they pose and go liberal oh I have a liberal voice I
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:31.400]  have a trendy gay marriage while they're just stealing trillions out the

[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:15.400]  Times oh we're such intellectuals oh I mean you people live in the matrix that
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:20.040]  think I'm a cook and White House you know connected groups write articles I
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.600]  talk about begging trendy to listen to me
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:26.800]  Alex has no one's listening to them and he's begging people to listen to him as
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:32.840]  his credibility falters and his popularity implodes and yeah uh-huh and
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:41.760]  and Kate Upton's ugly this show is exploding in popularity people are
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:47.880]  listening all over the place a massive massive awakening is taking place
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:58.440]  massive awakening is taking place huge and then I read these articles that are
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:02.880]  just meant with their little echo chamber socialist followers to read it
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.880]  and to feel like they're the establishment and they're trendy and
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:12.200]  they're winning I mean it's a literal mind control of a bunch of pathetic mental
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:18.840]  midgets busy talking about how smart they are let's go now to Jacare Jackson to
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:22.320]  finish up with his report and go to Joe Biggs to get his military perspective
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.600]  because I know he's been in a lot of martial law areas to get his take on
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.720]  what he saw there last night in Ferguson if he liked seeing people have a laser
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:35.440]  systems pointed at their chest because when I've seen in military situations
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.760]  checkpoint videos unless they're getting fired and things are really dangerous
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:43.800]  you're not aiming guns at people's chest unless you think that they're about to
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:47.040]  attack you that's very provocative so we'll learn if he even did stuff like
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:51.400]  that against enemies in Afghanistan and Iraq in a moment with Staff Sergeant Joe
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.160]  Biggs but first off Jacare any other points yes Jacare Jackson reporting from
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:00.200]  Ferguson Missouri the site of the riots following the shooting death of one
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:03.040]  Michael Brown now we're here at the quick trip store and I want to point out to
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.800]  you Alex the quick trip store that was burned down when it all hit the fan this
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:10.800]  is all the employees had to fight back with this one little extinguisher maybe
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.480]  they had a couple more in the store but this is what the armaments were that they
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:17.800]  had to fight back with did to put out the fires to defend themselves that's
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:21.640]  pretty much all they had when the looters came and it's just it goes to tell
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.600]  you all the people who say that why do you need this why do you need that to
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.600]  defend yourself because you know fire hydrant isn't going to stop a whole
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.160]  big fire of a fire hydrant isn't going to stop a bunch of looters who come into
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.720]  your store and I'm not blaming quick trip for that I just want people to
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:37.440]  realize this this is why you need your second amendment so looking more at the
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:41.600]  damage here you it's it's what you see it's all tore up you see the wires
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:47.240]  hanging from the roof charred down nothing usable and I've been in several
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:51.080]  quick trip stores during my life like I said they they're based in Oklahoma and
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:55.520]  you know I can imagine what this used to look like you know the with the soda
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:01.320]  fountains and all that but there's nothing here but just charred it remains
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.840]  I just want to point out somebody tries to come burn up our operation or any
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.200]  business I'm in or my house or my family they're gonna get met with the second
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.800]  amendment now I know that's blasphemy to the socialists that have been
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.080]  conditioned to just bend over and get raped but not me and of course notice
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:21.040]  we interviewed the gun shop owner they were right net down the street and right
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.840]  next door to a place that got looted they didn't get looted because they had
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:29.320]  15's yeah we went to that location last night and we saw how you know it's
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:32.960]  pretty much a clean area like you have the gun shop and a couple shops on
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.680]  either side that were pretty much completely on touch and then up and down
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:40.520]  the street either side the Dollar General some other stores they even rated a
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:44.280]  Christian day school for whatever reason they bashed out one of their windows
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.880]  I'm not exactly sure what the looters plan to find in there but yeah other than
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:50.960]  that you know the gun shop owners they stood their ground and they made sure
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.880]  that the protesters knew that you know this isn't a place that you want to
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:58.720]  come well that's what it comes down to and you know automobiles are much more
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.440]  dangerous than firearms that people don't have any reverence of them this
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:07.480]  357 Magnum that I've had in the radio studio for 10 years of course I got an
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:12.880]  AR-15 right over there as well or a M4 and then we got of course 308 reapers
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:16.400]  50 cows whatever we need I mean it's not that we're even living in fear we're
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:20.400]  living in strength we're living in security and we're living in the fact
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:24.960]  that it's our job to protect ourselves right and just like you alluded to you
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.960]  know the police were very busy the night or the nights of these riots and not
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.440]  even talking to some of the guys in that area over there near the gun shop they
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.920]  said hey you know we're not so much mad at the police we know they had a lot of
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:38.720]  stuff going on they couldn't put out every fire so to speak so that's why we
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.480]  disbanded ourselves you know it's not so much us against them deal dealing with
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:46.080]  the pure because we stood our own ground and when we had a visible presence out
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:49.440]  here nobody wanted to mess with us like they passed over you know like those
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:52.200]  stories in the Bible you'll they passed over they said we don't want anything to
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:55.680]  do with those guys so that's why you need to have our permits to protect
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:02.760]  yourself jacari jackson reporting from Missouri thank you so much we're now
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:07.080]  going to go to Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs retired and get his perspective here in
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:13.160]  a moment as a veteran multiple tours in Afghanistan and Iraq who ran a lot of
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:17.000]  security duties a lot of checkpoints you name it I want to get his take on the
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.520]  overall response and what he thinks about all this from Ferguson Missouri we
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:28.000]  just skipped this network break coming up at the bottom of the hour we will be
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:34.320]  taking your phone calls and getting in to the latest Ferguson revelations but
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:38.600]  also the latest Snowden revelations that he says can break down the entire
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:43.080]  Western system it'll come out they're running little kids and stuff they'll
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:47.360]  probably get medals they'll probably say if you aren't for being a pedophile and
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:51.280]  you know snuff filming three-year-old you're a racist and then they'll probably
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.720]  become something they teach in public school I mean I'm not kidding at this
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:57.240]  point they'll probably have Christian churches in Dorset or something I mean
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:01.960]  that's how sick these state-run churches are but is there anything will bring down
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:05.920]  this corrupt system because the system is run by evil people that's why all of
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:11.360]  it top-downs illegitimate I don't know what we replace it with because the
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:16.160]  society so corrupt as well we now go to Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs retired
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:21.640]  reporting from the outskirts of St. Louis there in Ferguson the epicenter of
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:26.840]  what is becoming the new Trayvon Martin scandal with a professional FBI
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:34.440]  provocateur race-bader co-intel pro officer Al Sharpton there on the scene
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:41.680]  trying to start things up along with Reverend Jesse FBI operative was there
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:45.960]  helping set up Martin Luther King Jackson so according to people that were
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:50.520]  there but again joining us at Joe Biggs you've been there I don't know your take
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:53.560]  yet I'm about to find it out you shot a lot of that video last night with Josh
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:58.640]  Owens and Jacari and what's your take on it Joe Biggs info wars.com standing
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:03.200]  outside of the QT in Ferguson Missouri last night was very intense Alex I
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:08.320]  mean emotions were high you know we got out here and like Jacari had said
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:11.720]  earlier the police told us we could walk down this way and it's about a mile
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:15.920]  walk and they said that we'd be able to speak to somebody and it was crazy we
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:19.120]  didn't even see the riot police standing and blocking the bridge we
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:22.920]  automatically headed straight over here to this this quick trip and started
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:27.880]  filming and I could hear a clash like the the baton against the shield and we
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:32.120]  looked over to the right and these guys were lined up or ready to go and at this
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:35.480]  time there weren't many people out they were standing in front of their
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:41.640]  vehicles about 45 minutes later I would say about 10 to 15 vehicles started
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:46.880]  driving down the road and behind them anywhere from 150 almost 200 locals from
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:50.960]  the area were marching down with their hands up screaming hands up don't shoot
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:57.480]  and chanting that they want justice. Now we've got the video of them with the
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:02.520]  guns on the dashboards and on the hoods of the armored vehicles aiming them at
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:09.240]  people it's HD Jacari says he did witness the red lights I've seen in some
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:12.360]  of the video what appears to be red lights we need to blow that up and
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:17.000]  illustrate that for people you know expand that HD video zoom in on it for
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.760]  folks did you witness that and if so what what type of firearms did they have
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:28.360]  trained on the peaceful protesters chest? Yeah I saw that up to I would say
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:32.920]  anywhere from 10 to 12 times I saw one of the officers point the rifle with a
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:37.200]  laser beam on someone's chest like Jacari said earlier there's a clearly
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.360]  marked line across the road right before you cross over into the bridge area
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:45.120]  most of the protesters sat there on their knees or stood up with their hands
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:50.600]  up in the air if you cross that line as a protester they automatically put that
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:54.480]  red dot on your chest Josh was able to get his camera and work with the lie a
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.520]  little bit and he asked me to come over and I looked at the camera and I could
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:01.760]  see the guy carrying what seemed to be an AR-15 was something on the bottom I
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:05.360]  was assuming it was probably a 203 grenade launcher that they can use to
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:12.520]  put tear gas smoke into to shoot on top of that he had you know a laser laser
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:16.040]  mounted on top of that as well with a pretty big sight you know they were
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:18.560]  sitting there you could hear them when we walk around the side a little bit you
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:21.800]  could hear them communicate back and forth say hey move the lights we can't
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:27.120]  see this guy hey this guy just moved his hand and they were moving the laser
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:32.000]  round back and forth on people you know at this point most of the arrive police
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.640]  had moved behind the m-wraps that were you know do the police there I mean I
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:41.400]  know these are sheriff's department and city police do they have any idea what's
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:45.400]  gonna happen if they mow down a crowd of black people this country is gonna burn
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:50.040]  to the ground and extremely provocative that the cops are doing that I want to
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:56.120]  say right now that police chief needs to stop them or he needs to have that
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:00.560]  city council shut him down right now well they need to come out and give a
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:05.200]  statement as to what their side is right now because you know as you know last
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:09.720]  night another shooting happened another person was critically wounded out here
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:14.440]  in Ferguson a mile away from where we were just you know moments after we had
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.320]  left this area you know last night the mobbing was happening the people were
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:23.480]  you know gathering up in numerous parts over the town the spot we were at last
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:27.440]  night that we came to was by far the largest gathering of people protesting
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:30.920]  with the bull horns and all that but there was another spot about a mile
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:34.480]  behind us where there were people that started gathering after we started
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:45.080]  pulling away and it was just intense everywhere yeah you could hear them and
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:48.960]  they were also telling people as well to get out of here you know you couldn't
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:52.640]  be any more basically inciting a curfew you know telling the local residents
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.240]  that they could not be out on their streets well I get the fact that you
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.400]  can bring a curfew in and in martial law if there's looting and stuff but this
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:05.200]  is day four last night there wasn't any looting going on looters would have been
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.960]  back in the dark doing it these are people protesting a lot better looking
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:14.160]  crowd of older folks well-dressed people you know a lot of really concerned
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:18.160]  looking people the first night was a bunch of thugs using Craigslist we
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:22.520]  confirmed to use this as an excuse to go rob stuff but the next two nights it's
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:26.560]  it's concerned people from what I've seen on the video is that an accurate
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:29.920]  statement or is it incorrect Joe oh that's very accurate I mean one of the
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:33.360]  guys who spoke to last night right towards the end very well-educated a
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.880]  very articulate man and he said that you know from what he believed most of
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:40.160]  people that were riding around here you know the initial time when that
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:44.040]  happened weren't even from this actual area right here most of the people here
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.960]  from this area are you know coming out cleaning up and trying to you know clean
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:52.240]  up the mess that was made by these outsiders that kind of its own record
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:56.960]  that a bunch of thugs from other parts of St. Louis came down there to join in
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:00.000]  on the fun and you know they took they took complete advantage of the
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.600]  situation and they use that as a way to release anger and just unleash hell on
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:09.720]  the small town right now there are people walking up and down the streets
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:13.520]  families with children you know you know anywhere from three years old all the
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:17.120]  way up to I've seen 60 years old yeah communities out walking around right
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.720]  now with shovels with trash bags well it's gonna be just like it's gonna be
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.080]  just like V for vendetta I keep telling people this they're gonna shoot a crowd
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.160]  when things collapse somebody's gonna shoot a kid the bullet is gonna go
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.960]  through somebody hit a kid and then all hell is gonna break loose and and and I
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.680]  don't care what the police departments do the everybody's gonna join in and the
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:39.760]  police are gonna make themselves the enemy which is what the globalists want
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:44.120]  we do not want an us against them mentality and the police I can see
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:48.720]  them having riot batons or if people charge him pointing guns at them or
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.720]  something like that with rubber bullets but when you are pointing live ammo at
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:57.760]  people with laser sights to try to intimidate them all that does is make
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:03.680]  people angry now I am told somebody threw a water bottle at the police so yeah
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:07.680]  that that that's when things got pretty heated because I didn't actually see I
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:11.400]  was looking right at the actual of the riot police because they were just now
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.840]  moving the vehicles around this is mainly the sheriff's department correct
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:19.120]  yes the bottle came overhead and hit the ground I just heard a thought and I
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:22.120]  kind of like you know been over a little bit because I didn't know what happened
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:28.480]  and all you can hear was screaming everyone's running off everyone in the
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.440]  everyone in the crowd was like why would you do that you're gonna get someone
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.880]  killed we're trying to be here peacefully minutes later everyone got down
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:38.760]  they said a prayer and they were talking about you know how they wanted to
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:42.680]  bring change that what's going on here the violence is no way to solve a
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:46.080]  problem because all this did was hurt their community this is a gas station
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.760]  that people went to every day they felt before they went to work and to buy
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:53.280]  things for their family now they no longer have that if you look over here
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:56.480]  the left you can see people out here they're actually part of the cleanup

[01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:00.840]  wars.com going back to Joe Biggs to finish up Joe with your experience in
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:05.320]  Afghanistan and Iraq undoubtedly very dangerous places where you yourself got
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:09.480]  shot and blown up a couple times in armored vehicles I've just talked a lot
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:14.000]  of veterans and also watched a lot of videos generally unless somebody was
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:18.280]  doing something really suspicious I didn't see troops aiming guns at them I
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:23.160]  saw a lot of videos of protests in Afghanistan and Iraq and I wouldn't
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.520]  really see people aiming guns that people would have guns there'd be guns on
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:31.440]  armored vehicles ready to be swung up but you didn't point guns at general
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:35.600]  crowds because obviously that would make them hate you that tended to escalate
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:41.720]  things am I incorrect in saying that that was army policy that made sense or
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:46.320]  correct me I mean compare that what you experienced in war zones to having laser
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:53.520]  pointers you know laser sights on AR-15s pointed at peaceful protesters well
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:56.480]  what you do in a situation like that it's called the low ready and like you said
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:01.200]  you don't have your weapon pointed up at anybody you have your you know the
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.680]  weapon cocked down with a muzzle pointing at the ground where you could
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:08.240]  quickly bring it up if need be if there's a threat it's called the low
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.920]  ready and use that as a non-threatening way when you're in a situation like that
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:16.920]  last night what we encountered when we were told we could come and talk to the
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:20.760]  public information officer down here we were not met with a low ready we were
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:27.160]  met with intent to shoot you know these guys had at the at the ready pointing
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:32.280]  at people having a laser on them you know as a veteran I don't quite appreciate
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:38.640]  you know serving my country and then coming into this town this police state
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:43.120]  a complete militarization of what's going on I mean basically what this is
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:46.680]  is martial law happening right here in Ferguson I don't like when I come up
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:50.040]  there and they're pointing a gun at me especially when I've done nothing and
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:53.160]  everyone's hands are up in the air you know it's complete lawlessness these
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:58.480]  guys were out of control I mean it was way too much force for what was here you
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:03.960]  know you don't shoot an elephant with an artillery round it just doesn't make
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:09.040]  sense if you guys did stuff like this in Iraq or Afghanistan what would have
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:12.400]  happened they would start throwing bottles at us someone would call the
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:17.160]  Taliban and then more than likely we get ambushed and killed you know you try to
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:20.880]  be respectful because you know they have grievances as well they're trying to
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:24.640]  talk about protests what it is that they're upset about and if you go and
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:29.200]  they're pointing guns at everyone like that all it does is incite violence now
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:32.840]  that's from somebody on the outside studying warfare in history that was
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:38.160]  what I believed you've experienced it that I don't get why militarized police
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.840]  act different than military they think aiming guns at people and shouting and
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:49.640]  and trying to scare people scares them instead it's making Americans totally
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:54.480]  hate the police because what they do Alex is they get this young hot shot guy
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:59.440]  who used to be Johnny football so to say and couldn't quite make it in the
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:04.400]  military and now what he's done is he takes that mentality of being this you
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:08.640]  know Rambo-esque type guy and he joins the police force and gets thrown on a
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:13.080]  SWAT team and now he thinks he can just go around pointing weapons it's a lack
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:17.120]  of training that's what it is and it's taking someone without any kind of life
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:22.080]  experience whatsoever and putting them in a godlike situation or the weapon in a
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:26.880]  rural city in America and that's when bad things happen I expect tonight to be
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:31.040]  just as heated as it was last night well you know they were they were told
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:36.560]  you're our sniper team get up there on top that and you anybody gets across that
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:41.640]  line you put a laser on them so we all know who's designated and I'm sure it
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:46.720]  was quote officers with the laser designating everyone else for control
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:52.240]  field of fire if they pull something on us and what's gonna happen is one cops
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:56.040]  gonna pull the trigger oh there's video yeah of the lasers on the black man's
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:39:00.440]  back oh my god that oh my okay well they just sent us the HC footage I hadn't
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:05.840]  seen this people with their people with their hands up with lasers on them and
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:11.160]  with their hands up in the back and if it turns out this guy they shot was shot
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:14.680]  in the back this is unbelievable again folks we just sent reporters there to
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:22.560]  find out the truth what's going on just heard sound like a some kind of shot or
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:28.080]  something in the distance last night the mainstream media was for the most part
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:32.520]  off to the side of the road jacari jackson and I was we're the only ones
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:37.160]  really out there standing in between the crowd of protesters and the riot police
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:41.200]  in the middle of the zone where if you walked out of there they'd start
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:44.920]  pointing weapon at you you know I'm not gonna sit here and hide behind the
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:48.800]  crowd we got out there and got the best footage we could the job America could
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:52.240]  see what was happening you know these guys are pointing guns on us we got as
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:56.160]  close as we could by the way it looks like these guys are at least 70 or 80
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:01.880]  yards away with cops aiming loaded firearms they were they were they were
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:07.000]  maybe you know 75 meters away from from that incident I mean where that was
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.680]  going on if these guys were in a safe area and what really sparked it off was
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:14.920]  the people for the most part were standing on the side of the road because
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:18.280]  they were they didn't want to get gassed because it's happened before in the past
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.720]  well one of the police officer says you need to go home go back to where you
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:26.360]  came from and everyone said what do you mean by that and they just sparked
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:31.560]  people yelling screaming you know f the police you know you can't do this why are
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:35.960]  you making us live in a militarized police zone this is martial law why are
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:39.680]  you turning Ferguson into the Gaza Strip we're tired of this we have rights
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:44.040]  why aren't you giving us why don't you let us exercise our rights to protest
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:48.840]  peacefully well again and they're also a bunch of idiot thugs that burn some
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:55.920]  stuff down but that doesn't mean you get to then just point guns at people who
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:03.120]  are 75 meters away which I guess that's about 75 yards yeah I mean all the
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:07.880]  people I spoke to last night were very cool calm and collective you know they
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:12.040]  were very well-spoken they had an agenda as to why they were there they had a
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.440]  reason to speak they they knew what they were talking about and they did it in a
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:22.880]  very orderly fashion well I'd seen the video earlier with the lasers and the
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:27.040]  way the video cut I thought the crowd was like 50 yards away I didn't realize
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:32.360]  you were 75 80 now I'm looking at videos like 90 yards away 80 meters I
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:37.160]  mean this is outrageous people with their hands up with loaded guns aimed at
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:41.560]  them with lasers on their chest I mean do the cops know what's gonna happen I
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:45.240]  guess they already shot somebody else last night yeah I mean I mean how do we
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:48.040]  know they didn't just randomly shoot somebody in the back last night again I
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:53.480]  mean like I said I'm pretty sure the way everyone is around here everyone's
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:57.040]  very heated about this very emotional I think for the next few days this is
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:01.240]  gonna continue to happen every night and we're gonna be here to keep bringing you
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:06.360]  coverage about what's going on for info wars calm well we talked to the
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:09.720]  firefighter that owns the gun shop and he's pretty pub police and he says
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:13.200]  they're pretty professional so I just really want to get the truth here I
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:18.640]  don't want to take sides but man I was kind of leaning towards the police
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:22.360]  yesterday but we sent you up there to find out the truth and now there they're
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:26.600]  acting like this I can't believe the police sent you down there and then they
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:30.680]  were aiming guns at you when you arrived I that that's what really you know teed
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:35.000]  me off the most that's what I did not like and I found extremely disrespectful
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.280]  and just unprofessional in every way that the police officer a mile down the
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:42.920]  road to the other end clearly told jacari if you want to go down there you're
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:47.420]  free to walk down there and you can go and speak to them and we were met by
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:51.680]  riot police with guns pointed at us very unprofessional you know we obviously
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:56.040]  had our hands up we saw the people doing it and as we were walking down you know
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:59.920]  jacari Josh and I were all putting our hands I'm saying hands up you know don't
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:04.200]  shoot we were all being compliant with what was going on as we approach that
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:07.680]  area and they just started breaking out the sniper rifles and pointing to the
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:12.320]  people well I'm gonna go to some calls here Joe begs continue to follow
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:17.720]  reports and I'd like to I know I see you guys on short notice but I'd like you
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:23.520]  guys to stay there basically as long as this continues to unfold because if they
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:29.120]  can get the police to pull off a new kin state Obama would love that to get
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:34.000]  riots going nationwide so he can then bring in martial law we need those
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.840]  police to reach out to the community and to treat them respectfully and to stop
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:43.080]  pointing guns at them for no reason because we don't want the police to
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:47.720]  look bad and we don't want the states to look bad and we don't want Obama to
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:53.920]  send federal troops into there and we could see where all this is going we
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:57.720]  don't want to start new watts riots can you imagine what Al Sharpton and Obama
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:01.840]  will do with that they will have a heyday with this and I'm telling you
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:07.160]  that sheriff and the police chief and the mayor and all of them better get
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:11.120]  there you know what together right now Joe well the people of Washington need
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:15.240]  to sit back and look that the ones who are trying to take weapons away from
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:19.400]  people and saying that they don't have that right this QT didn't have weapons
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:24.240]  and look at it it's completely demolished the tattoo shop is fine the gun
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:27.600]  store fine and the other little stores right there kind of beside them were fine
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:32.880]  why because they were exercising their rights to have those weapons and they
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:38.200]  did not get affected by this sure Joe have you running any listeners who are
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:44.320]  info wars.com visitors or listeners so far I have not Alex but I'm sure if
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.880]  we're here you know this will be our first full day we got here pretty late
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:50.200]  last night right when a lot of the stuff was happening but I'm sure over the
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:55.360]  next day or so I mean I found from England you name it we're either mobbed
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:59.840]  or no one knows who we are it's like either or as we've seen many times in
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:04.560]  live feeds listeners walking by saying hey info wars.com but you know try to
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:08.680]  identify how politically informed folks are I heard some yelling going on can
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:12.400]  we pan around while I take some phone calls and it's going to keep the feed
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:17.880]  up so folks can see what's going on I heard some shouting or yelling what
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:22.000]  was going on. The gentleman's right they're pointing at the building and
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.280]  saying this is what it's not about you know this is about the death of a
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:32.760]  person not the looting of everything. You're right all right Joe thank you so
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:36.840]  much for the reporting great job to you and Jakari and of course Josh Owens
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:44.120]  there really wartime reporting this is wartime coverage in America with these
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:50.280]  armored vehicles we were told before al-Qaeda being used on peaceful crowds
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:55.280]  and this will only escalate things and I guess if these sheriff's department guys
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:01.720]  want to escalate it and want to get a civil war going they're idiots I mean
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:11.320]  that's all I can say I mean I have to reserve some judgment for now I've got
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:16.520]  to you know sit there and reserve judgment on that now our phone feed
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:19.920]  screen went down for a minute there it is so I'm able to go to your phone calls

[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:17.400]  airwaves go ahead hi Alex first thing I want to say is I'm pretty emotional and
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:22.880]  passionate so if I piss someone off I apologize it's political correctness to
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:28.920]  worry about that just go ahead never apologize for your passion anyway I am so
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:33.600]  sick of Christians telling me why do I bother this is all in God's plan that's
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.320]  pure BS it's my understanding it's for none to perish and this goes for the
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:43.320]  Middle East as well as America we are not a powerless people we serve a strong
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:48.760]  and mighty God we can call on him to smite those who are who are persecuting
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:53.280]  our brothers and sisters in the middle exactly but we have state-run churches
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:57.080]  that aren't really Christian churches saying praise God things are getting
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:00.080]  better you're gonna get out of here soon they'd rather complain about a woman's
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:05.040]  short skirt and you know fill all goody two shoes about it then go protest in an
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:09.840]  abortion clinic and so they're the modern Pharisees and so you just need to
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:14.520]  move on you notice Christ didn't preach all day to the people that claim they'd
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:18.640]  found God he preached to the people that were unwashed who wanted to hear the
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:24.840]  truth oh that but it's just we can weak this is a time for spiritual warfare a
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:30.480]  heart built a prayer does avail much that we can write to our congressman we

[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:13.680]  about abortion well don't do that I mean that wouldn't be Christian the state
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:19.960]  says abortion is good so all Christians should abort babies go ahead Kyle you
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:23.040]  know I guess I want to talk about that and just throw out a little message for
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:29.520]  everyone I called in there oh gosh I don't know a couple months ago and I had
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:34.280]  I had said something about how we need to find ways to market the truth and I
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:37.400]  thought of a quick 30-second pitch for the Federal Reserve and I got another
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:42.600]  one for you you know really relating to abortion because I think in order to
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:50.280]  win this fight we have to deconstruct the kind of pre-designed arguments that
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:58.280]  they've came up with to sell us on a lot of this crap so for abortion you know I
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:02.600]  guess the the way I try to articulate it to people is tell people it's not a
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:07.800]  choice but it's a very getting pregnant is not a choice but it is a
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:14.240]  consequence of a choice so it's being pitched as a choice but really that's
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:18.720]  the furthest thing from the truth and then you couple that with the fact that
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:22.640]  you know that the other argument is well it's a woman's body well the reality is
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:31.440]  is that that fetus that human baby from a DNA standpoint is genetically unique
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:37.000]  and dissimilar from the mother well here's the deal it's another entity when
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.880]  you start killing the babies unborn next is the old people and now that's begun
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:45.960]  and next it's let's have death panels and let's not give veterans care it's a
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:54.320]  predatory society sold as a communitarian collectivist society when
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:57:01.640]  it's a cannibalistic society and abortion is not abortion in the life of a
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:06.000]  mother it's a medical procedure you change definitions they'd always gone in
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.680]  and done surgeries of mother was gonna die the babies could die anyways and
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:12.800]  then done a surgery and then they try to save the baby but it dies that's not
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:17.280]  abortion but they spin it and stuff and they say well what have in the case of
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:22.080]  rape and it just goes on and on it's being done to sell the idea of a
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:26.840]  culture of death it doubles a woman's chances of uterine cancer they're not
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:29.720]  telling women that they're not telling them there's groups that'll pay for their
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:34.240]  baby pay for them to have it they just keep women ignorant and sell Planned
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:40.200]  Parenthood as this loving liberal organization not the Nazi founded scum
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:45.400]  of the earth trash that liberals are mainline American British and German

[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:02.560]  question for you and just a point I'd like to make I don't know if you saw
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:06.320]  this daily caller article out there right now about it's just funny to fly

[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:13.360]  on it last week they said they're gonna take over the White House and fly it
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:17.760]  and yeah so along with you guys then force coverage in Ferguson Missouri I
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:22.120]  just I'm just kind of seeing this thing go off that the New World Order is poking
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:26.120]  here at Patriot Americans and maybe use this thing that the mainstream media
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:30.280]  has termed the bubble effect and try to get this thing rolling explain that to me
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:33.120]  can we come back because I'm sure it's interesting but I don't know I don't

[01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:49.960]  others stay which this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network the

[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:20.200]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:30.600]  Alex Jones the Bubba effect is what the Pentagon trains for not to fight al-Qaeda
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:35.240]  in Tennessee or Texas or North Carolina is in the Pentagon drills has been in
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:39.000]  Forbes magazine to take on gun owners if we don't turn our guns in it's
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:43.200]  terrorist and they have to come crush us but then meanwhile it could be the
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:46.920]  Bubba effect where you get a bunch of mainly white cops in a southern area
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:52.280]  like Missouri and then you got a bunch of thugs running around burning stuff
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:56.200]  because the cops might have or might not have done something wrong and then the
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:01.280]  cops get brutal on peaceful people and then that triggers an event cops shoot a
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:10.080]  bunch of people like a new can state can't state it's over because you're
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:13.480]  you have a federal government that is going to race bait under Obama and this
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:19.040]  could be the false flag they could use a crisis like this to absolutely burn the
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:25.360]  country down so I just want cooler heads to prevail and not have the police be
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:31.480]  provocative aiming lasers at peaceful people you know 75 80 meters away with
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:35.680]  their hands up I mean I would get mad if I was there covering something in a
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:41.320]  laser was on me I mean it's just it's just a joke it's so sick Mac flush out
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:46.000]  your point about the Bubba effect go ahead yes sir thank you I'm I do a small
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.840]  show on Saturday nights at the week in conspiracy.com and we've come up with a
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:53.640]  second piece of this that we think is very important and I think it's the new
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:57.040]  world order system of problem reaction solution but I think there's gonna be two
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:00.960]  solutions I think the second solution particularly this Ferguson thing there's
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:05.600]  a lot of armchair patriots people out there they're gonna actually ask for
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:09.240]  more of this militarized police oh yeah I've always said that as society breaks
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:14.100]  down you'll need the military and martial law not that it's good the
[02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:18.080]  collapse is staged but still the collapse is real the troops are in a
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:21.880]  rock and a hard place and you'll need them to keep the plant the power plant
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:27.360]  running yes yes and last point Alex one of the things I've talked to a lot of
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:31.560]  people here recently on the show and we interviewed a bunch of people who are
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:36.520]  involved with satanic ritual abuse and if that's as prolific as I think it is
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:40.000]  and our permit and they're behind some of this I'm afraid there's no hope for
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:45.640]  this country well we do have incredible numbers of really sick pedophiles and I
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:51.480]  don't mean people dating 17 year old girls I mean three-year-old babies just
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:56.080]  are filling the Democratic and Republican Party people go why are there so many in
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:00.280]  the Catholic Church you name it because one of them gets in they recruit more in
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:07.840]  like like like a Penn State or whatever and so yeah I mean this country is run
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:14.280]  by absolute just filthy scum and they've got a bunch of well-meaning people
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:17.720]  beneath them who don't know about it enforcing this whole police state the
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:21.040]  name of safety and all you're doing is securing a panoptagonic
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:26.920]  technocracy of total surveillance to suppress good people Matthew in Alabama
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:35.880]  you're on the air go ahead hey Alex yes go ahead yes I'd like to make a few
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:39.320]  statements about the Federal Reserve yeah you bet we're not screening calls
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:45.000]  you're live on there right now I would also like to make give you a quick
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.560]  history lesson about go ahead start give me the history lesson go ahead it's
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:55.480]  about the 1776 the year that you like to talk about it's about the Revolutionary
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:00.880]  War more specifically the reasons behind it in a lot of schools all over the
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:05.680]  country these days and for a long time now we were told it was because of the
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:13.360]  taxes correct the p-tax yes all stuff but I'm here to say that that is for the
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:20.760]  most part incorrect the reason behind the Revolutionary War King George the
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:29.400]  third actually made illegal are colonial scripts oh I know so yeah we revolted
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:34.240]  over taxes the French got manipulated by a group of criminals to overthrow one
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:38.120]  system and put in another tyranny we're one of the only truly successful
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:43.040]  revolutions in history that didn't make things worse and that's why so much of
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:49.080]  world future events will be decided about what happens here now Matthew I got

[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:36.320]  calls right now Matthew Steve culture hunter JB and others but first I think
[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:49.240]  I hear Diana Ross's voice you better turn this up
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:16.320]  oh
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:23.640]  stand up for the children though but if it's a creeping assault on your
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:28.520]  children like vaccines or fluoride in the water or school systems designed to
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:32.160]  dump them down and they don't rub it in they just creep up and do it and it's
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:36.440]  all compartmentalized well then they'll go along with their kids getting hurt the
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:40.800]  general public will doesn't matter of screen time lowers their IQ and hurts
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:44.480]  their brains most people that their kids watch too much television and get on the
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:10:03.960]  iPad too much I probably even do so is it true let's crank it back up try to save
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:11.680]  civilization I know that mega churches are buying Microsoft connect systems
[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:16.240]  that literally watching track the kids and face-scan them mark of the beast
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:21.400]  technology I know that we're in deep trouble coming up I'm gonna bring this
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:26.320]  up to Ray McGovern Snowden says there's a holy bleep smoking gun revelation
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:30.360]  coming soon we'll talk to Ray McGovern get his take on what that might be right
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:33.760]  now let's race through your calls Matthew what was your other point you wanted
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:39.120]  to make go ahead and from Alabama yes first I want to make a statement about
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:44.880]  the federal reserve we all know it was founded on the 24th of December in 1913
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:50.080]  which that by itself is a major indicator of deception there I mean
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:55.200]  Congress clearly distracted by Christmas reminisce through it's totally
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:11:00.200]  absurd but I have two questions I have for you and let me ask them both for
[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:05.160]  your answer the first one is who is the first director of the federal reserve
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:11.160]  who was put in charge of organizing the finances for World War one and my
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:15.040]  second question was who is the principal shareholder of the Reichstag Bank
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:20.360]  during the same period put and in charge of organizing the finances of the
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:24.680]  German side in World War one all right well let me answer that question now
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:30.040]  that was Tammy Terrell not Diana Ross her voice is a very similar but she did
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:34.280]  re-recorded later and it sounded just the same I think I like Tammy Terrell's
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:39.040]  voice even more but to go back and answer your question I know Edward Mandel
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:44.600]  House was instrumental of House Park from Austin British intelligence in
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:50.680]  getting it basically written and put through and I know you know who was at
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:54.840]  the Jekyll Island meeting a months before in Jekyll Island Georgia but I
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:58.600]  don't remember the other one and then I've forgotten the other question so I
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:04.120]  can't sit here all day why don't you just enlighten us well the first director
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:10.240]  of the Federal Reserve was a Mr. Paul Warburg oh yeah yep that's right and
[02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:14.760]  ironically enough the principal shareholder of the Reichstag Bank in
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:20.120]  Germany during World War one was Max Warburg sure and the Bush's Bush
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:25.920]  seniors dad Prescott Bush ran the US Division of that a lot of the Nazi
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:29.120]  money went to them that's why they're secretly one of the richest families in
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:32.560]  North America and boy they get really freaked out when that information gets
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:36.400]  out very interesting thanks for reminding me about that Matthew let's go to
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:41.120]  Colton in Florida I got a cousin named Colton Colton you're on the year
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:46.960]  welcome hey Alex how you doing man good bro um I just wanted to bring up a
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:50.800]  couple points I got a lot I want to say to you but honestly I just keep it the
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:57.480]  way I decided I'd say I you woke me up a year ago and I thank you for it sir the
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:02.520]  first thing I wanted to mention was that I'm blind and I'm 21 I go to
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:07.280]  college I'm first-year college student and I'm on the social security system and
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:12.080]  food stamp system and I absolutely hate the fact that I am and I try listen
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:16.360]  brother people that are blind that's what welfare is for and it should be
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:21.080]  state-run it should be the churches they should have a job for you to do in
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:24.480]  some industry than people buy from that industry and then you make even more
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:29.160]  money and you're self-sufficient and your taught skills instead it's a new
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:33.240]  world order system that has taken over the welfare system but listen don't feel
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:37.760]  guilty about that go ahead yeah and I mean that that's part of the reason why
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:41.360]  like I know there's a lot of people out there that you know take advantage of it
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:44.800]  and use the system and stuff like that like you know these legal immigrants
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:48.640]  and things like that I'm in college to get off of it I'm in college to join the
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:52.920]  free market and become a independent taxpayer and you know do all the great
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:56.720]  things that you're talking about and you know I'm not as informed as I should be
[02:13:56.720 --> 02:14:00.240]  like it's like I said you woke me up a year ago but I'm I just wanted to throw
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:04.640]  that across you and the other thing too I try to get your message out there and
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:09.360]  people know that because I'm blind I'm on the system they they don't take me
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:14.440]  seriously they say oh well you're on the system you know and well look a lot of
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:18.760]  people feel really insecure and they want to feel intellectually superior so
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:24.760]  they say I read the New York Times I watch MSNBC like saying they have 45 PhDs
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:28.880]  or something and like wow you read basically White House written
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:33.400]  propaganda you watch publicly written White House teleprompter scripts man you
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:39.400]  are smart you watch a FBI informant race baiter Al Sharpton race bait man you're
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:43.600]  really intellectual and then they'll look at somebody who's criticizing the
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:47.800]  system and say yeah but you're on welfare the whole point is is that you
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:53.080]  recognize it it'd be like if you're an alcoholic and it's killing your liver and
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:56.800]  you at least say I'm an alcoholic I need to quit drinking so much
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:15:03.120]  hypothetically that's the first step in trying to fix things but I mean listen
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:09.400]  I had family I had family that worked in special operations black ops you name
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:13.240]  it and they were all boy you're a smart young man you better watch it they'll
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:18.280]  kill you so I hear that from them but from the others they would just say
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:22.160]  you're nuts I saw you on national TV you're crazy the government's not corrupt
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:28.360]  none of those people laugh at me now so it's very few folks that are in denial
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:34.480]  right now they just will debate you about what the solution is so I wouldn't
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:37.600]  feel bad when somebody calls you an idiot or somebody says you don't know
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:41.800]  what you're talking about move on just say hey I'm just concerned about the
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:49.200]  fact that we have an untenable debt because I am dependent on this and again
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:54.840]  it's just that conversation that will change the world that's yeah I can
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:58.080]  continue to get your your information out there your word out there you know
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:01.840]  despite what people say despite how people may look at me and then because
[02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:04.600]  I'm on the system I continue to get it out there and I'm gonna continue to get
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:07.600]  out there listen I would quit just making an issue how you're on the system
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:13.600]  the system is for people like you that's what the general welfare clause is not
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:17.880]  for people that don't have a real bonafide disability and again I'm all
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:22.480]  for safety net it's that the people running the safety net are running it
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:26.240]  as a fish net to bring you into politically eat you as a political
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:33.760]  commodity not to protect you it is a net not a fence and it's like the
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:37.320]  worldwide web I mean it's just so draconian but please just get past the
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:43.360]  guilt complex the corporate welfare is the problem Warren Buffett running
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:48.560]  around shing raise taxes on poor people when he's tax exempt and he gets the
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:55.480]  biggest percentage per capita of anybody of taxpayer money oh but he's Warren
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:57.840]  Buffett
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:02.280]  well listen I'm gonna let you go I gotta jump brother I thought you were gone
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:07.960]  I'm gonna go ahead and talk to Steve and main Steve you're on the air go ahead

[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:22.800]  need that are legal here and fixing this mess we have but my problem is is I
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:31.320]  know for a fact in Maine that nobody can stay at a church at night in Maine you
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:36.880]  can't even park a tent out in the yard they'll close you down so but and I know
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:42.000]  for a fact that immigrants are here and they're not here correctly and I'm not
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.400]  sure yeah yeah and they're gonna throw the book at you and treat you like crap
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:48.440]  because you follow the rules and then they can suspend any rules they want
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:52.080]  and if you don't give the illegal aliens all your money and everything you've
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:56.960]  got then you're a terrorist no I get it it's pure bull it's horrible and I don't
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:18:01.160]  know why we're not you know I'm we just this is crazy what we're all oh and by
[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:08.120]  the way I can't go to China or Brazil or Mexico or South Africa and demand a
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:13.360]  bunch of free goodies only Western countries say we're bent over everything's
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:17.680]  free come in here and trample on our culture under under political correctness
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:23.720]  anything Western anything anti-communist is bad anything including Al Qaeda is
[02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:28.440]  good that's outside America and if you dare say it's wrong to sexually mutilate
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:33.160]  women and put burkas on their heads you're a bigot and a closed-minded person
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:37.360]  that isn't smart enough to read the New York Times the New York Times that lied
[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:42.360]  to us about yellow cake from Niger Africa the average lazy moron at the New
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:46.840]  York Times can't find Niger on a map just because they got a Harvard degree
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:51.560]  that they paid for and talking a simpering chicken neck voice does it
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:57.120]  mean they know anything about history like people like me that live this anything
[02:18:57.120 --> 02:19:03.240]  else yeah oh in the death panel oh that that was in the bill but see I do how to
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:07.080]  read the bill now they admit the death panels but the Times said it was a
[02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:14.320]  right-wing racist lie but now they got death panels on our veterans on your
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:22.680]  veterans because if I actually could afford to buy my health documents sir I'm
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:27.520]  not gonna listen to a word from you until you learn to go one of the the
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:32.120]  situation in the metrics is quite understandable for reasonable policy to
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:38.160]  help the people Obama cares for the children your taxes are down Obama care
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:46.160]  is free everything is wonderful as long as you take the vaccines sir this is in

[02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:09.800]  ahead hey Alex I'm a first-time caller I want to ask you a question about the X2
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:14.480]  I tried to talk to my doctor about and he was like if you guys warned and
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:17.560]  proceeded to tell me how he gets children's fluoride pills and everything
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:22.760]  so I can't really you know consult my position about that but I'm not asking
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:26.600]  you for any any medical sure sure what's your question I can pass it on
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:32.680]  because Dr. Groups doing a frequently asked questions article and a video we
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:36.480]  keep meaning to get him up or to do it to try to answer the frequently asked
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:42.000]  questions so if I can't answer it Dr. Group can go ahead I want to know what
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.760]  you have personally found work for you at the X2 I've been taking it for two
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:50.640]  weeks I love it now how much do you take a day how much do you find is working
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:58.000]  for you I will appreciate your call let me try to answer that I personally take
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:05.360]  about two dropperfuls a day I take about two-thirds of a dropperful in the
[02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:10.480]  morning two-thirds of a dropperful at lunch and then two-thirds of a dropperful
[02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:15.080]  at night I'll be honest some days I forget to take one of the dosages
[02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:21.360]  sometimes I forget all together that's my problem when I remember to take the
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:27.480]  Beyond Tenghi Tangerine 2.0 organic when I remember from M4SELF.com when I
[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:31.960]  remember to take the X2 of the supermail vitality then I see the effects and
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:38.440]  it's been that I'm working out pretty much less eating the way I've always
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:44.800]  pretty much been eating exercising and getting better results just healthier
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:49.880]  my skin's healthier I get a better tan my hair grows faster I mean all the
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:56.480]  things that the evidence shows having a healthy thyroid does there's massive
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:27:07.640]  research I was eating iceberg lettuce during the break and I was also taking
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:11.920]  phone calls during the break I tend to multitask around here it's speaking of
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:16.760]  unhealthy it's not good to try to eat half of a wedge iceberg that's my lunch
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:21.320]  with blue cheese during a four-minute break I try to eat during that four
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:24.200]  minute break because it's the longest break of the hour the others are three
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:34.520]  minutes or one minute but long story short I cannot really do justice to what
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:41.800]  iodine has done for me and if you just look at what iodine deficiency
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:47.680]  does to babies in utero to your glands to your body you then know why the
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:54.920]  establishment puts fluorines and bromide and things in the halogen table that
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:28:00.200]  are bad in the food in the water I mean it's in baking powder it's in all sorts
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:05.080]  of stuff it's in powdered eggs it's in thousands of products and it's extremely
[02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:10.160]  toxic and you can type in fluoride extremely toxic or fluoride Harvard
[02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:15.080]  study and it's not my opinion it's a fact but they created a social stigma
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:21.360]  around laughing at people that talk about it and call it a conspiracy theory
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:26.840]  that CIA 1963 declassified a few years ago to call anybody that said JFK was
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:31.360]  murdered and was more than one shooter a conspiracy terrorist it's a stigma
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:35.000]  doesn't matter if there's a Harvard study doesn't matter if there's thousands of
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:38.760]  other studies doesn't matter if the type of fluoride they put in the water is a
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:44.160]  toxic waste derivative you do need calcium fluoride a little bit of it they
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:50.280]  just have a stigma so iodine is the good halogen you need and the government
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:58.840]  from the 20s into the 70s recommended it be put in salt potassium iodide not
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:03.880]  even the good type so the people wouldn't get all sorts of goiters and
[02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:09.120]  thyroid problems that was epidemic across North America and by the 70s they
[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:15.120]  said okay take it out of the salt now and that was a type of kind of sneakily
[02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:20.440]  medicating people but notice now they take that out and say here's the fluoride
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:25.840]  so there's your issue x2 is our best seller along with the original fluoride
[02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:30.040]  shield and original survival shield and the purchases of it support the
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:35.880]  broadcast I just challenge people to try it see if you like it regardless you're
[02:29:35.880 --> 02:29:42.160]  supporting the broadcast but it's well-known literature that iodine is
[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:46.280]  needed but they say consult your physician before taking vitamin C so I
[02:29:46.280 --> 02:29:50.560]  just throw that in they'll be right back stay with us we're on the march the

[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:28.200]  information I mean I got Snowden type stuff when I was first on air in the
[02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:32.680]  mid 90s had no idea how big it was with telecom whistleblowers about big hubs
[02:35:32.680 --> 02:35:37.080]  listening to everything and keyword and echelon and I had James Bamford on but
[02:35:37.080 --> 02:35:41.160]  I know Ray knows about a lot of this and we don't know what this particularly is
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:46.400]  but I have a good idea about a whole trove of things that could bring down
[02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:51.120]  the political system and what would they do to distract from that so I want to
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:54.320]  just hit the waterfront with Ray because I know we can go into each issue and
[02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:58.480]  really give us a briefing on each item but if he had you know 10 minutes which
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:02.080]  I'm gonna give him the floor here and try to shut up to give people a global
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:07.040]  briefing on the state of the world I want him to give us his well very accurate
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:10.520]  analysis but also he's a very moral person and you know knowing him now for
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:16.080]  about 10 years putting him in one of my films he doesn't miss words and I think
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:20.000]  really gives us his real take on things without putting it through an
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:25.400]  establishment filter or darkly and so I want to get his big picture taken and
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:28.720]  hone in on what he thinks is most important but first off what do you
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:34.640]  think the new Snowden info could be right well Alex good to be back with you
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:42.320]  that is a curveball could you give me a minute to get my catcher's mitt you know
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:48.120]  I'd only be speculating but I imagine given what Glenn Glenn Greenwald has
[02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:54.880]  kinted at in the past that there are names and there are numbers and there
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:37:01.360]  are incredibly heinous snooping activities going on against very
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:07.360]  important people I'll let you guess who they are but they couldn't be more
[02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:15.680]  important in our country and once that's revealed one would expect that substance
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:21.640]  you mentioned to hit the fan but you know the way things are working Alex with
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:28.080]  the executive and the Congress and parts of our judicial system all kind of
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:33.800]  complicit in these crimes against our Constitution you know I'd have to say I'd
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:37.640]  be have to be from Missouri as to whether anything would be done about this
[02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:42.080]  even the press of course the mainstream press and I'm talking about you and
[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:48.280]  others on the internet the mainstream press is a complicit in this so yes I'm
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:52.360]  sure there'll be more shocking revelations I expect that my name and
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:57.440]  yours to show up on one of these lists sometime soon but whether or not this
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:38:02.920]  will have any impact I mean if well we'll just have to see that's my best
[02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:11.200]  guess how big are the overall revelations so far from Snowden and others
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:16.080]  how much is that affecting the power structure or is it almost allowing them
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:20.920]  to come out of the closet caught lying about illegal political spying and then
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:24.840]  if they don't get in trouble or if they don't get reversed it almost sets the
[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:31.640]  precedent that's the problem once Obama decided that he'd only look forward and
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:37.520]  it wouldn't look back you know that's a abnegation of his responsibility to see
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:41.640]  to it that the laws of the land are faithfully discharged that's a
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:46.720]  constitutional embarrassment and so not only with the torturers but with we'll
[02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:53.440]  take James Clapper the National Intelligence Director who sits over 16
[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:59.160]  count them 16 intelligence agencies in our government he was asked on the 12th
[02:38:59.160 --> 02:39:06.720]  of March last year by a senator Senator Ron Whiting does the NSA collect any
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:15.120]  data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans Clapper no sir not
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:21.400]  Whittingly now two months later he gave a letter to the head of that committee
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:29.280]  saying oh what I said was quote clearly erroneous and quote sorry about that now
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:34.520]  he was under oath he's the head of the director of National Intelligence he
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:42.280]  lied under oath he told Andrea Mitchell well I said the least untruthful thing
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:48.080]  well what was it well you come to here when when the head of intelligence lies
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:53.600]  and then there are no consequences so I'm afraid your point is right as long
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:58.720]  as we have people covering up for one another John Brennan included of course
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:04.080]  with this famous torture memo memo that the Senate Intelligence Committee has
[02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:09.320]  completed as long as you have no accountability and as long as nobody in
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:14.880]  Congress except Ron Whiting and Udall from from Colorado where nobody has any
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:20.880]  guts it's very different very different Alex from the situation in the mid 70s
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:26.440]  when Frank Church from Idaho and a couple other people that's key in the in the
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:31.840]  house stood up and said you know these CIA NSA army intelligence abuses are
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:37.520]  just gone too far we're gonna have a real investigation now as a sort of a
[02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:43.600]  corollary to this guess what the first thing Frank Church found out he found
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:51.400]  out that J. N. Grohova was wiretapping all his phones of course so so we put it
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:56.200]  in to J. N. Grohova's wiretapping that's actually J. N. Grohova went away which
[02:40:56.200 --> 02:41:01.220]  was sort of a miracle and we instituted some laws including the FISA Act of
[02:41:01.220 --> 02:41:07.480]  1978 which expressly prohibited the kinds of infringements on our Fourth
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:13.640]  Amendment rights that had been entered into before and now we see on steroids
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:19.040]  so it's a situation where we have to get out in the streets where we citizens
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:24.480]  have to put our bodies into the machine or else it's never going to stop Ray
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:29.520]  McGovern you've lived a lot of years and seen a lot not just in the White House
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:34.480]  but Vietnam you name it describing the slow evolution of America getting
[02:41:34.480 --> 02:41:38.280]  better in some ways but worse than others I didn't live through a lot of that
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:43.960]  I'm 40 but I've studied it and I've got to say America overall is
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:50.520]  degenerating into a kleptocratic weird corporate fascist
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:59.600]  bizarro world and seems to be rotting now seems to be just just malaise is setting in
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:03.600]  and it's not even like a hyperterony where the Nazis are rounding up all
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:07.600]  their enemies of course they're killing a lot of innocents overseas they're
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:14.880]  mainly just doing it all out in the open flaunting it in a grotesque display of
[02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:24.240]  above-the-law behavior I mean how would you describe what we are today well I
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:30.280]  would say that we're an extra constitutional society right now and
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:36.600]  the thing that bothers me most Alex is something that you know when you're
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:41.840]  51 years in this town of Washington you see a lot of change well there's one
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:46.680]  change that dwarfs all the other changes and that is that we no longer
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:53.280]  have in any real sense a free media and that is big look at how the media has
[02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:58.080]  distorted ABC and D look how it's it's a the
[02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:05.360]  distorting the coverage on Gaza on Ukraine any big-time conflict the media
[02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:10.360]  will destroy it what's the result of that well most Americans don't have a
[02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:16.080]  clue as to what's going on and that's really really really dangerous Jefferson
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:22.000]  Madison many people pointed out that without a free press that there can be
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:27.600]  no democracy and so that's the main bugaboo here and that's why your job and
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:31.920]  my job to the degree we're trying to spread some truth around is so terribly
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:36.800]  important now it's the bad news the good news is this that what whereas the
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:43.080]  fourth of the fourth estate dead okay fourth estate some of your listeners
[02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:51.440]  probably remember that that expression was coined by Edmund Burke a an English
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:58.600]  member of Parliament back in the late 18th century now he stood in Parliament
[02:43:58.600 --> 02:44:03.720]  at that time there were three houses two in Commons one of Lords and he said you
[02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:08.480]  know I'm very proud to be part of this first estate that's what they call it
[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:13.000]  they're the first estate House of Commons but more important than I and all the
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:19.800]  rest of you MPs are the people in the fourth estate you looked at the balcony
[02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:24.600]  and of course they were all men in those days but he was looking at the press the
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:29.320]  the pulp press he said you are more important than all of us because you
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:34.080]  hold us accountable without you we can't be a democracy now that's the fourth
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:40.040]  estate and it's dead now good news there's a fifth estate I'm looking at it
[02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:44.560]  here I'm on Skype you're doing it here there are all kinds of
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:49.800]  ways to reach people especially the people who are gonna live a long a lot
[02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:54.360]  longer than I am and longer than you are too Alex that's the good news they
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:58.120]  won't put up with this stuff they don't even read the newspapers and I can't
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:02.800]  blame them what they get is a steady diet of things on the web so we have to
[02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:07.000]  make sure that the right diet of things on the web and I think it's our pill
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:12.680]  struggle but we can't give up there's no option to give up people were talking to
[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:18.720]  me yesterday on Al Jazeera boycott this vestment you know sanctions that I think
[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:22.840]  it'd be effective effective effective I said you know you're asking the wrong
[02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:28.480]  question we're not we're not called to be effective all the time we're called to
[02:45:28.480 --> 02:45:34.120]  be faithful we're called to be doing the good because it's good and we may not
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:38.960]  immediately achieve our objectives we probably won't but we're sowing seeds and
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:43.000]  we're showing the younger generation that we have something special here and
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:46.880]  we're willing to suffer that's key you do the right thing and fight back against
[02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:51.640]  tyranny because it's in your bones and in your gut and in your family line and in
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:57.760]  civilization not because oh I can win if I'm good and then sometimes I lie or
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:01.800]  sometimes I'm corrupt that's Machiavellian bull and I think it's that
[02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:07.280]  Machiavellian mindset that was always there but it's really permeated not just
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:11.320]  the government and the corporations but some of the public a lot of the public's
[02:46:11.320 --> 02:46:16.000]  waking up and becoming more moral getting back to what really matters but for
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:21.040]  the others that aren't I think it's a a a a decadence in society and with that we
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:25.480]  know comes depression comes war what's your larger perspective Ray McGovern
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:30.640]  former top CIA briefer and analyst to Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:33.760]  Bush what you and we really appreciate your time so there's no you're a busy
[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:39.600]  man what is your larger world view right now on the state of things with IS and
[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:44.320]  Ukraine and the fighting getting really bad and I want to bomb IS because they're
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:49.720]  horrible you know cavemen murdering Christians and Muslim minorities but
[02:46:49.720 --> 02:46:53.800]  at the same time that's a new way to get back in Iraq which we wrecked to begin
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:47:01.080]  with it's so complex yeah the the Iraq thing is a catastrophe and we're
[02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:09.760]  responsible for it there's no way that we can support the equivalent of the
[02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:18.360]  Islamic State in Syria and then fight against it in in Iraq I mean hello who's
[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:25.440]  running our foreign policy a bunch of sophomores now there's a scale that
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:29.280]  supersedes what I've just been talking about and that has to do with a real
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:36.280]  danger to our national security and that is Russia once again we used to think
[02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:42.720]  that Russia was sort of tamed that we could provoke it we could prick the
[02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:49.840]  Russian bear a poke it to a fairly well well that's not the case anymore and I've
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:57.160]  just written an article actually it's a it's a celebration of sorts on the ending
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:48:05.080]  of the Berlin Wall after 28 years the Berlin Wall was built exactly 53 years
[02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:11.520]  ago today they started to build it now what's my point on all that well those
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:17.280]  were the days when the Russians felt threatened and we felt threatened those
[02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:22.080]  were the days of the Cuba missile crisis the checkpoint Charlie face off with the
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:27.680]  tanks of Soviet and American those were the the times when there was a real
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:32.640]  Cold War and there was a real danger if statesmen like John Kennedy weren't
[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:36.080]  around that things would get out of hand and would blow each other up and the
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:42.080]  planet with us okay now that was quiescent until now what's what's happened now
[02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:48.760]  well what happened now is that after the Berlin Wall fell and that was
[02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:54.920]  November 1989 there was an incredible chance for peace Alex you know I sound
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:59.680]  maybe this sounds weird especially for the younger generation but there were
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:04.160]  enlightened leaders get up a choff and should not say that foreign minister in
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:10.800]  Russia they were willing to deal okay and they did deal what happened was George
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:15.480]  H.W. Bush called up kind of a choff you know he said you know I'm really sorry
[02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:19.640]  about all your troubles Mikhail and I'm not going to take advantage of them
[02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:24.560]  let's get together let's not waste any time I suggest we get together in Malta
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:29.760]  in three weeks what do you say okay and they did okay November 9th the
[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:34.920]  wolf walls December 2nd they're in Malta they had a summit and they decided
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:41.880]  okay we the United States would not take advantage of as Bush said I'm not
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:46.360]  going to dance on the Berlin Wall well you know that was very much to his credit
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:50.840]  but then he said but we're going to require some things of you mr. Karabachov
[02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:57.520]  at the time there were 24 Soviet highly mechanized divisions in East Germany
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:04.880]  24 you know what that translates to about 250,000 men okay now what Bush said
[02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:10.920]  was this look we don't want you to do what you did at Hungary in 56 what you
[02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:15.400]  did in Czechoslovakia 68 we don't want you to do that now as East Germany and
[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:20.800]  the rest of your satellites are falling apart in return for that we will honor my
[02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:28.240]  obligation not to move NATO one inch farther eastward toward Russia now we
[02:50:28.240 --> 02:50:33.520]  expect you to allow East Germany to become part of a greater reunited stay
[02:50:33.520 --> 02:50:36.480]  there come back and finish it and now the deal has been broken I know you're
[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:40.840]  gonna get to that part but for folks that don't know we've broken an official
[02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:44.440]  deal with Russia and are moving weapons up against their borders not that Russia
[02:50:44.440 --> 02:50:49.160]  is greater wonderful in my view like like Ron Paul said Putin's no angel we're
[02:50:49.160 --> 02:50:54.480]  not lionizing him but the West George Soros all of them are starting this and
[02:50:54.480 --> 02:51:01.040]  so under common law on common sense we're the bad guys recent events have

[02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:36.080]  breakdown from his perspective which I agree with on the history of what has
[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:39.200]  happened so far so you were getting right up to the break with your point
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:44.160]  that this deal was made for those that just joined us with the fall of Berlin
[02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:48.920]  wall three weeks after between George Herbert Walker Bush the West and the
[02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:54.080]  Russians with Gorbachev and others that we would end the Cold War not fight
[02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:58.520]  over the former Eastern Bloc let it go the way it wanted to self-determine few
[02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:03.680]  with Russia most with NATO and others but not move weapons in and then now that
[02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:10.640]  balance is being changed please continue sure well Alex one of the most
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:15.840]  important aspects of this of course was the quid here for the poor quo now the
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:20.480]  quo was we wouldn't move NATO eastward the quid was that the Russians were
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:28.560]  going to be asked to accept a reunified Germany okay in NATO but reunified now I
[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:34.720]  still get hair on the back of my neck bristling or and I say that I lived in
[02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:40.240]  Germany for five years I didn't want to you Germany and I'm not a Russian the
[02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:48.200]  Russians suffered 25 million killed in World War two that path toward Russia
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:52.560]  has always been used by Napoleon other other people attacking Russia you can
[02:55:52.560 --> 02:55:57.360]  imagine what a bitter pill that was for them to swap to swallow and the only
[02:55:57.360 --> 02:56:02.760]  reason they swallowed it was for solemn assurances by George HW Bush and James
[02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:07.680]  Baker as foreign secretary or a secretary of state promising that NATO
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:12.080]  would not know move one inch farther toward Russia now what happened well
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:18.720]  within a few years there were 12 12 count them 12 new NATO members all to the
[02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:23.320]  east of East Germany the original membership of NATO was only 12 so it
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:29.200]  doubled in size and then this is key six years ago at a NATO summit in
[02:56:29.200 --> 02:56:35.280]  Bucharest Romania the NATO leaders decided Ukraine would become part of NATO
[02:56:35.280 --> 02:56:42.240]  not would will okay now that was that was a bridge too far the coup that was
[02:56:42.240 --> 02:56:48.740]  arranged by the US and the EU in Kiev on the 22nd of February that was one
[02:56:48.740 --> 02:56:53.880]  regime change too far the Russians aren't going to permit this and that's what
[02:56:53.880 --> 02:57:00.960]  this is all about okay what what Putin has said is look we are very concerned
[02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:08.760]  about our only one water port in Sevastopol in Crimea this is why we we
[02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:15.000]  honored the plebiscite in in Crimea and accepted Crimea back into Russia proper
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:22.080]  the Russian Federation because you know we as it's coverage sometimes sometimes
[02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:27.520]  Putin sort of does things in a kind of light manner he said now you know I'm
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:33.240]  sure that the NATO and US sailors are really terrific fellas okay but I'd
[02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:39.360]  rather not have it to be so that that our our sailors are gonna have to visit
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:46.360]  NATO bases in Crimea I'd much rather have it the way it is now where US NATO
[02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:50.720]  sailors are very happy to be entertained by sure and that's pretty much always
[02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:54.160]  been part of Russia and so that's all been overthrown we're almost out of time
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:59.120]  sir where is it all going in your view well unless the United States stops
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:04.840]  saying that Ukraine which is ravaging the eastern part of the country that it
[02:58:04.840 --> 02:58:08.320]  has a right to defend itself just like Israel has a right to defend itself
[02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:14.900]  unless that stops Russia will be tempted to move in there not only with red
[02:58:14.900 --> 02:58:20.720]  cross-type supplies but with the kinds of armaments that will prevent the
[02:58:20.720 --> 02:58:26.840]  Russian speaking separatists they're the really federalists from getting a
[02:58:26.840 --> 02:58:31.480]  completely bloody nose and from being exterminated and then they tell bring in
[02:58:31.480 --> 02:58:36.000]  more troops than it escalates no water conflict well that's the problem oh my
[02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:39.800]  god I've come back for two minutes and finish your point back in 70 seconds

[02:58:44.960 --> 02:58:54.320]  today from the water table to our soils the atmosphere itself our world is
[02:58:54.320 --> 02:58:57.880]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[02:58:57.880 --> 02:59:01.920]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[02:59:01.920 --> 02:59:06.120]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[02:59:06.120 --> 02:59:10.000]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:14.320]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types
[02:59:14.320 --> 02:59:18.120]  of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact
[02:59:18.120 --> 02:59:21.640]  that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I
[02:59:21.640 --> 02:59:25.280]  began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start
[02:59:25.280 --> 02:59:30.080]  cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape

[02:59:51.840 --> 02:59:57.520]  direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[02:59:57.520 --> 03:00:00.280]  network
[03:00:00.280 --> 03:00:12.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[03:00:12.840 --> 03:00:20.360]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[03:00:20.360 --> 03:00:28.120]  Alex Jones. So we've broken down the real history the mainline history this is
[03:00:28.120 --> 03:00:32.960]  stuff for anybody that's even as basic history knowledge would know Ray McGovern
[03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:37.520]  is breaking it down but if you watch CNN Fox News any of it you would think that
[03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:41.800]  the Russians are the most evil people in the world it's Putin's missile they
[03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:45.560]  want to start World War three I mean that whole shoot down to that airplane
[03:00:45.560 --> 03:00:49.560]  looked to me like Lusitania part two Ray McGovern what did you think of that
[03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:54.120]  briefly and then finishing up where this is going because you got NATO generals
[03:00:54.120 --> 03:01:00.160]  saying we need more fighter wings we need troops very provocative why would
[03:01:00.160 --> 03:01:05.760]  they want to start a new Cold War. Well you know Alex I don't completely
[03:01:05.760 --> 03:01:12.440]  understand why anybody would even want to countenance that you know you have to
[03:01:12.440 --> 03:01:18.360]  look at who profits from these things Wall Street profits the weapons
[03:01:18.360 --> 03:01:22.920]  manufacturers profit they control the media you know it's pretty insidious I
[03:01:22.920 --> 03:01:28.720]  used to read these the Russian media all the time and they had propaganda labels
[03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:35.080]  like Wall Street skier Caravatici which means Wall Street bloodsuckers well I
[03:01:35.080 --> 03:01:40.000]  used to think you know that's a little ham-handed but look what happened 2008
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:45.520]  2009 look where we are so there are forces driving this thing that profits
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:51.200]  here on conflict I can't believe that anybody in that in their right mind would
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:55.920]  take the danger of taunting Russia to the point where retaliate and when you
[03:01:55.920 --> 03:02:00.960]  asked John Kerry that they asked him a month ago aren't you aware that this
[03:02:00.960 --> 03:02:05.840]  could lead to an armed clash with Russia and Kerry said well yes I've taken I've
[03:02:05.840 --> 03:02:10.760]  taken that into account well does he think that his pastel ties and his
[03:02:10.760 --> 03:02:15.520]  centaurian voice is going to save him from from the consequences of this
[03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:20.800]  they look at him as a liar I'm afraid to say and as a person that can't be
[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:26.480]  trusted and Obama you know Obama has been not very truthful about these
[03:02:26.480 --> 03:02:30.000]  things so the Russians are on their guard they don't know exactly what to
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:35.160]  expect nor do I or why and that makes this thing very volatile well right
[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:38.720]  that's my final question and also statement to you I've studied history
[03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:42.480]  it's fascinating Napoleon was super smart one of the best generals probably in
[03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:48.480]  history also evil miscalculated with the Russians Hitler did the same thing but
[03:02:48.480 --> 03:02:55.560]  it's larger than that even smart dictators can miscalculate and and and
[03:02:55.560 --> 03:02:59.120]  even a smart West that was somewhat moral could miscalculate them nuclear
[03:02:59.120 --> 03:03:04.920]  war back when you were in government somewhat moral in general but this
[03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:08.760]  degenerate corporate one where there's so many degrees of separation they're
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:12.680]  not even making the decisions based on things they're just used to making 40 to
[03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:16.720]  one bets on the stock market with other people's money it's like Wolf of Wall
[03:03:16.720 --> 03:03:22.040]  Street on PCP they don't even care and they're clearly making decisions and
[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:27.960]  doing things that are so destabilizing and dangerous that it's not going to be
[03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:31.160]  good for their defense contractor business or Wall Street if we have a
[03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:34.960]  nuclear war with Russia I mean somebody's got to restrain these people
[03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:39.040]  because because it looks like they're asleep at the switch I mean I think we've
[03:03:39.040 --> 03:03:44.320]  really reached stick a fork in us a decadence level in the ruling class
[03:03:44.320 --> 03:03:47.920]  where they're off playing golf Ray I don't think they even know what they're
[03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:54.960]  doing well it's true you know and it's the old syndrome Alex you know I've
[03:03:54.960 --> 03:03:59.280]  often wondered what people do with their second million or the third million or
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:06.240]  the I mean there's an insatiable appetite for collecting or grabbing more now I
[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:10.720]  think you're right this is going to reach a no good end as the Chinese are
[03:04:10.720 --> 03:04:16.000]  fond of saying but people don't realize this and Obama is really pretty much a
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:21.040]  tool in their hands so if you're poaching how are you going to react when
[03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:29.760]  what happens is this missile defense system now that's the biggest corporate
[03:04:29.760 --> 03:04:37.360]  welfare project in the country's history it'll never work but can the Russians
[03:04:37.360 --> 03:04:40.640]  depend on that of course not and so what are they doing they're putting it on
[03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:45.880]  ships they're putting it in the black sea and they're targeting ICM bases
[03:04:45.880 --> 03:04:50.080]  within Russia that's trouble you know it's only good for a first strike
[03:04:50.080 --> 03:04:54.480]  absolutely and so if you're you're worried about a first strike what are you
[03:04:54.480 --> 03:04:58.400]  gonna do at the first hint that it's coming you're gonna launch on warning
[03:04:58.400 --> 03:05:08.640]  and we're all gonna be dead Alex
