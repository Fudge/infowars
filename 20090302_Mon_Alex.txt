[00:36.080 --> 00:41.280]  with the security situation in Mexico as they collapse into full-born civil war
[00:41.280 --> 00:46.360]  in the meantime though we are going to have wide open phones today on any
[00:46.360 --> 00:51.680]  issue any item anything you wish you discuss I love all the different topics
[00:51.680 --> 00:56.760]  and issues and ideas the wildcard that the listeners as callers add to the
[00:56.760 --> 01:03.800]  transmission and I would like to hear from folks all over the planet with their
[01:03.800 --> 01:09.560]  concerns about the banker designed worldwide meltdown the people awakening
[01:09.560 --> 01:14.000]  to the tyranny that's taking place the fact that more and more mainstream news
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.760]  articles admit a world government is being set up by the very private central
[01:17.760 --> 01:23.160]  banks that have engineered the crises that we face the toll-free number to
[01:23.160 --> 01:33.200]  join us is 1-800-259-9231-1800-2599231 here's the headlines Dow

[02:17.640 --> 02:22.640]  info wars dot com new world order crony very hard calls for compulsory civic
[02:22.640 --> 02:27.960]  duty bloggers are not journalists according to a new Senate bill so they
[02:27.960 --> 02:33.440]  can restrict free speech and also violate people's journalistic rights that
[02:33.440 --> 02:39.520]  have been enshrined in all free nations to not give up sources Ron Paul says we
[02:39.520 --> 02:43.880]  killed a million Iraqis at the big conservative conference that rush
[02:43.880 --> 02:49.280]  limbaugh was the keynote speaker at and got applauded he got applauded saying we
[02:49.280 --> 02:54.800]  shouldn't be in Iraq because you see there is a media illusion that most
[02:54.800 --> 03:01.920]  conservatives want war and like the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan only
[03:01.920 --> 03:07.120]  weak-minded fake conservatives believe that and it's evidenced by many
[03:07.120 --> 03:11.520]  different pieces of data but the biggest one is that Ron Paul I have a
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.080]  correction to make I actually looked the numbers up Ron Paul didn't just get
[03:16.080 --> 03:20.880]  more contributions of any Republican candidate he got more contributions
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.440]  period more than Obama from the military why because he would really in that war
[03:25.440 --> 03:31.560]  overnight so just just just amazing piece of data there just like they claim
[03:31.560 --> 03:36.320]  that all his spanics want open borders and want to merge Mexico in the US but
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.440]  Gallup polls show upwards of 80% are against it just like every other
[03:40.440 --> 03:44.880]  American it's this group think all conservatives are for war they're
[03:44.880 --> 03:48.760]  actually not all his spanics when open borders actually the vast majority aren't
[03:48.760 --> 03:53.440]  it just goes on and on all liberals are for gun control and then you talk to the
[03:53.440 --> 03:56.200]  average liberal like I actually own guns and don't agree with the Democrats on
[03:56.200 --> 04:01.240]  that this is how they get you into group think ladies and gentlemen so we'll go

[04:06.040 --> 04:13.080]  over US clinic actual headline is designer baby row row over US clinic

[09:03.200 --> 09:06.600]  very informative guest coming up in about two hours dealing with a collapse
[09:06.600 --> 09:12.440]  that's ongoing the civil war in Mexico another very important article out of
[09:12.440 --> 09:16.760]  England about their military standing by for martial law the US military is
[09:16.760 --> 09:21.160]  standing by for martial law and the military is being told oh we're just
[09:21.160 --> 09:24.880]  now getting ready for martial law in America because of the economic crisis
[09:24.880 --> 09:29.880]  after decades of quiet preparation and the elites bragging that they were going
[09:29.880 --> 09:35.120]  to stage the economic collapse to bring in martial law and then even our own
[09:35.120 --> 09:39.080]  patriot movement debates whether the banking collapse is by design or not
[09:39.080 --> 09:42.200]  let me see these are the very same banks that have done this in hundreds of
[09:42.200 --> 09:46.520]  third-world countries and who bragged that they were gonna set this up in the
[09:46.520 --> 09:50.720]  United States in the 70s and the 80s and the 90s they wrote books and public
[09:50.720 --> 09:55.840]  publications about it in white papers and then three years ago we got inside
[09:55.840 --> 10:02.640]  info from Bilderberg group and detailed exactly what they were going to do how
[10:02.640 --> 10:06.840]  they were going to pop the subprime mortgage in the next three years now
[10:06.840 --> 10:10.000]  they were going to bring down the world economy bankrupt it and set up the new
[10:10.000 --> 10:17.680]  bank of the world and then five months before it really started plunging
[10:17.680 --> 10:21.440]  Lindsey Williams comes out who on record did work for Atlantic Richfield and
[10:21.440 --> 10:27.680]  says the former head of that company told him that the elite was going to
[10:27.680 --> 10:33.200]  plunge gas prices from 147 to 150 dollars a barrel to below 50 it's at
[10:33.200 --> 10:37.960]  like at 33 right now everybody laughed at Williams and it dropped to below what
[10:37.960 --> 10:42.560]  he said it would and then I forgot to even play this last week I got to pull
[10:42.560 --> 10:48.160]  it up John I sent it to you it's the George Soros clip Kurt Nemo wrote an
[10:48.160 --> 10:53.680]  article about it so the Paul Steve Watson George Soros admits elite
[10:53.680 --> 11:00.720]  plunging oil to bankrupt Middle East they now admit they're doing it this will
[11:00.720 --> 11:04.960]  cause Central America South America to go into depression this will cause the

[11:17.600 --> 11:24.240]  the Congo and other areas and in North Africa and Western Africa of oil it's a
[11:24.240 --> 11:29.280]  perfect plan and we're on record laying out what they were going to do and it
[11:29.280 --> 11:34.000]  all happened well we know what they're saying they're going to do next and let

[12:11.600 --> 12:16.160]  say oh he's got a nose or he's got a hunch it's not a hunch it's doing the
[12:16.160 --> 12:23.360]  job for 10 15 20 30 years it's eating drinking and sleeping something you get
[12:23.360 --> 12:28.960]  a very scary you know power of being able to understand what the
[12:28.960 --> 12:35.400]  establishment's gonna do just like a detective gets a if they're a good
[12:35.400 --> 12:42.400]  detective they've kind of gotten rid of that art but they admit the FBI got rid
[12:42.400 --> 12:46.280]  of more than 90% that as they moved them of their detectives their
[12:46.280 --> 12:49.840]  investigators that investigate white-collar crime by the elites instead

[15:45.880 --> 15:50.480]  springboard enterprise architecture development within the within the
[15:50.480 --> 15:54.520]  Federal Aviation Administration I've got your own documents I've posted documents
[15:54.520 --> 15:57.040]  that you people don't even realize I'm not talking to your listeners I'm
[15:57.040 --> 16:01.600]  talking to the New World Order I've got military documents from the Air Force
[16:01.600 --> 16:06.520]  that says that Hussein Aberman was involved with was developing PTEC and
[16:06.520 --> 16:11.600]  it was going to be used for military experimentation for C4 ISR development
[16:11.600 --> 16:17.240]  okay all you all of you top brass that are going to be engaging in this fake
[16:17.240 --> 16:22.480]  non-existent cyber terror that's going to be staged by Booz Allen Hamilton and
[16:22.480 --> 16:26.200]  all this is ridiculous and I want to mention one other thing there's another
[16:26.200 --> 16:31.760]  reason why cyber security is a total fraud okay north com as well as every
[16:31.760 --> 16:36.480]  other one of their allies in the New World Order they're immune to cyber
[16:36.480 --> 16:40.400]  attacks do you know why because they have something called a tech guard poly
[16:40.400 --> 16:47.280]  wall filter the $7,500 transparent network bridge appliance that uses
[16:47.280 --> 16:53.440]  artificial intelligence neural net devices that heuristically analyzes
[16:53.440 --> 16:57.720]  incoming traffic and they've there's a symposium that they had where they did
[16:57.720 --> 17:02.160]  simulated attacks from China and they were able to successfully defeat
[17:02.160 --> 17:06.640]  everything the New World Order systems are immune to attack even the ones that
[17:06.640 --> 17:10.960]  are on the regular grid irrespective not they have their own separate systems
[17:10.960 --> 17:14.960]  but they're already immune to stuff the only ones that aren't immune are the
[17:14.960 --> 17:18.800]  ones that they carry false flags out on so that they can sell that as an excuse

[25:30.920 --> 25:35.640]  make it because I was working on the new film and doing the radio show Sunday but
[25:35.640 --> 25:42.000]  then again Ron Paul growing reaching more people it Ron Paul and libertarian
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.000]  information and our information is the hottest thing on college campuses the

[25:49.800 --> 25:52.920]  brought up the fact that the patriot movement is what's hot with the young
[25:52.920 --> 25:56.680]  people they're not being fake conservatives or fake liberals they're
[25:56.680 --> 26:01.000]  waking up Ron Paul got cheered at the big national conservative conference
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.400]  this weekend when he said the war was bad and torture was bad and I mean people
[26:06.400 --> 26:11.560]  are waking up he's on CNN far more than any guest that it was running for
[26:11.560 --> 26:15.040]  anything in the last year another piece of information about Iran this
[26:15.040 --> 26:19.120]  information Rick Steve's has recently gone to Iran whether you like him or not
[26:19.120 --> 26:24.400]  he has shown some good images from Iran showing it a ancient wise and peaceful
[26:24.400 --> 26:29.360]  culture if you go to Iran daily Iran daily is a newspaper that spits out the
[26:29.360 --> 26:33.360]  truth it looks like they are progressing ahead and making friends with people all
[26:33.360 --> 26:36.800]  over the region yeah we'll attack on Iran looks the same reason I appreciate
[26:36.800 --> 26:41.320]  your call that the globalists attacked Serbia if they had aircraft
[26:41.320 --> 26:45.000]  manufacturing plants car manufacturing plants people were starting to vacation

[26:49.000 --> 26:54.240]  the bankers same thing with Iran its cities look like New York and Chicago
[26:54.240 --> 27:00.400]  they're even nicer and cleaner and they what is it about half their populations
[27:00.400 --> 27:05.400]  under 25 they're very pro-western and the globalists can't allow that that's
[27:05.400 --> 27:09.560]  why they took the shaw out when he quit taking their orders and put the Atolla
[27:09.560 --> 27:14.560]  Humeini in power and that's on record that's documented folks people just have
[27:14.560 --> 27:19.760]  trouble believing it rat they use radical Muslims to bring down mainline

[28:22.560 --> 28:27.440]  is you know yeah let me explain the first money FEMA gives a town or county
[28:27.440 --> 28:31.840]  even the smallest towns will be very reasonable like oh FEMA wants to give you
[28:31.840 --> 28:36.200]  a venting system or FEMA wants to give you some gas mask but it's the contract
[28:36.200 --> 28:40.760]  waving your rights going under federal control having to then go to mandatory
[28:40.760 --> 28:46.200]  FEMA meetings because you took the money and then a year later by the way can we

[34:28.600 --> 34:42.600]  let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Ohio Joe welcome to the airwaves
[34:42.600 --> 34:47.100]  thank you Alex just want to say you know the power of your show comes from the
[34:47.100 --> 34:50.600]  listeners and today's callers have been awesome they really give me a lot of
[34:50.600 --> 34:54.100]  strength and courage that we're gonna do something once you know you have a lot of
[34:54.100 --> 34:58.600]  supporters at verbalmilitia.com and Justin.tv we listen to you every day and we
[34:58.600 --> 35:02.100]  chat and we talk about ways to get active and those are two things I want to
[35:02.100 --> 35:05.100]  address quickly so you can move on
[35:05.100 --> 35:10.100]  two quick and easy steps number one a little after midnight eastern standard
[35:10.100 --> 35:16.100]  time AOL put out a poll about people standing up and questioning Obama's
[35:16.100 --> 35:23.100]  citizenship you can vote there it's on the front page on AOL political news
[35:23.100 --> 35:27.100]  and it's about 50-50 people that are questioning it
[35:27.100 --> 35:31.100]  also the second thing you can do when I do this every week
[35:31.100 --> 35:35.600]  Google your zip code and the word representatives and when you do that
[35:35.600 --> 35:40.600]  you get a list of people your local state senators and legislators people that
[35:40.600 --> 35:45.600]  will actually take your calls and read your emails I do this every week I kind
[35:45.600 --> 35:49.600]  of have a list of rants that I put together the trick is you send it out
[35:49.600 --> 35:53.600]  and a massive email out to all three or all four I mean you can do any amount of
[35:53.600 --> 35:58.600]  reps and I even I email people that you mentioned on the show Charles Key
[35:58.600 --> 36:03.600]  Cynthia McKinney so I send these emails out like I said once a week to a lot of
[36:03.600 --> 36:08.600]  people but I also email it to myself so that it comes back to my inbox and the
[36:08.600 --> 36:12.100]  next week all I have to do is you know make my amendments and change things that
[36:12.100 --> 36:17.600]  I'm fired up about this week or you know ways to respond to those those
[36:17.600 --> 36:21.600]  representatives and as we raise the background noise of people putting out
[36:21.600 --> 36:26.100]  real issues and real information we become the mainstream and we are in a
[36:26.100 --> 36:30.100]  race before the global stage their next terror attack or start their new war
[36:30.100 --> 36:35.100]  or release a new bio weapon and we've got to get that done and anything else
[36:35.100 --> 36:41.600]  there Joe your thoughts on Iran versus Russia is this all just WWF fake wrestling
[36:41.600 --> 36:46.600]  grandstanding or is there really a threat there what if Iran going to war with
[36:46.600 --> 36:50.600]  Russia yes do you think that's a possibility
[36:50.600 --> 36:54.600]  no I appreciate your call you know they've had some problems in the past
[36:54.600 --> 36:58.600]  and Russia has tried to take over territory in Iran's mountainous north
[36:58.600 --> 37:04.100]  before but it's Russia there that is building their peaceful nuclear reactors
[37:04.100 --> 37:08.100]  it's Russia giving them a lot of technology and so I don't see a big issue
[37:08.100 --> 37:13.600]  there I see Israel with Benjamin Netanyahu striking Iran and starting
[37:13.600 --> 37:21.600]  World War three I mean that alone will just really escalate things with
[37:21.600 --> 37:28.600]  Pakistan and India and India and China and the disputed Kashmir area with
[37:28.600 --> 37:34.600]  Pakistan and India that's how World War start you know generally in the
[37:34.600 --> 37:40.600]  substates as proxies via the larger empires and you have the Rand
[37:40.600 --> 37:44.600]  corporations saying they want a war to start in that region that will rival
[37:44.600 --> 37:52.600]  World War two in size so that then the American people are in a battle that's
[37:52.600 --> 37:58.600]  so hardcore we don't have a very good chance of winning the media will say
[37:58.600 --> 38:09.600]  unless everybody gets in on the fight and then the mass propaganda will only
[38:09.600 --> 38:13.600]  intensify I mean they're going to spend tens of billions of dollars
[38:13.600 --> 38:19.600]  domestically quote for the image of the Pentagon right now they are really
[38:19.600 --> 38:25.600]  gearing up the the the war propaganda right now with three doors down and
[38:25.600 --> 38:28.600]  kid rock and all these other rock bands being paid tens of millions of
[38:28.600 --> 38:34.600]  dollars to produce these propaganda pieces NASCAR being used as a you
[38:34.600 --> 38:37.600]  like NASCAR don't you well then you should be for war and joining the
[38:37.600 --> 38:41.600]  American attacking other nations the media is now right back where they were
[38:41.600 --> 38:48.600]  before they attacked Iraq saying yes Iran has nukes and then CNN hours later
[38:48.600 --> 38:53.600]  had to retract that and say might be able to get nukes and then retracted
[38:53.600 --> 38:57.600]  again and say well there could be a chance that they might actually have
[38:57.600 --> 39:04.600]  some of the materials to build a nuke or nukes and it just goes on from there
[39:04.600 --> 39:08.600]  they are really gearing up and I'll you know I'll go back to that group of
[39:08.600 --> 39:14.600]  stories two weeks ago that was in Israeli newspapers and also the one
[39:14.600 --> 39:20.600]  in Telegraph where Israel publicly brags that it is staging terror attacks
[39:20.600 --> 39:25.600]  in Iran committing assassinations and bombings to destabilize it these are
[39:25.600 --> 39:29.600]  acts of war ladies and gentlemen can you imagine if Iran was in the United
[39:29.600 --> 39:34.600]  States or in Israel or openly announcing they were in Israel staging terror
[39:34.600 --> 39:41.600]  attacks you know Israel says that Iran is covertly funding Hamas Hamas is
[39:41.600 --> 39:50.600]  the arch enemy of Hezbollah Iran does fund Hezbollah that's a Shiite group
[39:50.600 --> 39:56.600]  they are not funding Hamas but they know the public is ignorant it's just
[39:56.600 --> 39:59.600]  like when George Bush and then John McCain and others and the Pentagon
[39:59.600 --> 40:05.600]  keeps saying that Iran is funding the Taliban and al-Qaeda the Wahhabist in
[40:05.600 --> 40:09.600]  Afghanistan and Muhammad Karzai the US puppet on the White House lawn with
[40:09.600 --> 40:16.600]  Bush that I apologize your excellency but I just that's wrong Iran is the
[40:16.600 --> 40:22.600]  arch enemy of Wahhabist because Karzai knew how ridiculous that was to the
[40:22.600 --> 40:30.600]  billion plus Muslims I mean that is ridiculous that's like if Bush got up
[40:30.600 --> 40:36.600]  and said the Dallas Cowboys are the Seattle Seahawks and then you go no
[40:36.600 --> 40:41.600]  Mr. President the Dallas Cowboys are not the Seattle Seahawks that'd be like
[40:41.600 --> 40:44.600]  if Bush got up and said yeah the Dallas Cowboys are having a good training
[40:44.600 --> 40:50.600]  camp outside Seattle right now and they're going to be you know based out
[40:50.600 --> 40:55.600]  of Seattle and you know they've always been based out of Seattle and Roger
[40:55.600 --> 40:59.600]  Staubach you know played for the Cowboys in Seattle you'd say no that's not
[40:59.600 --> 41:05.600]  true the Dallas Cowboys are in Dallas Texas they're out of Arlington the
[41:05.600 --> 41:13.600]  suburb Texas Stadium I mean it's that stupid to the world Europeans know
[41:13.600 --> 41:17.600]  it's ridiculous the Chinese know it's ridiculous Africans know that it was
[41:17.600 --> 41:22.600]  between Shiite and Sunni it is just such an insult to everyone's intelligence
[41:22.600 --> 41:27.600]  you know they've handed down a death sentence to chemical Ali is his nickname
[41:27.600 --> 41:32.600]  today in Iraq the third death sentence they've handed down to him third trial
[41:32.600 --> 41:36.600]  remember how they claim they killed him five different times and they show his
[41:36.600 --> 41:40.600]  dead body and they show the dead bodies of Saddam's sons and then later
[41:40.600 --> 41:44.600]  report oh actually they're alive and then report they killed him again they
[41:44.600 --> 41:48.600]  just had to have somebody that Americans knew oh chemical Ali they even
[41:48.600 --> 41:53.600]  give him a nickname because Americans can't grasp the guy's real name how do
[41:53.600 --> 41:57.600]  we go from the smartest and most informed the stupidest the most ill informed
[41:57.600 --> 42:02.600]  uninformed ignorant so they go we killed chemical Ali again and we killed him
[42:02.600 --> 42:07.600]  and we'll kill him next week meanwhile five years ago we reported four years
[42:07.600 --> 42:09.600]  ago New Yorker magazine reported and then a year and a half ago the White
[42:09.600 --> 42:14.600]  House put out a press release on White House dot gov saying we are using these
[42:14.600 --> 42:19.600]  five different groups four of them were hobbyist the number three in Al Qaeda
[42:19.600 --> 42:24.600]  commands the biggest group attacking Iran on their border going in and engaging
[42:24.600 --> 42:32.600]  in sabotage and the now Israel admits they're doing and it's Al Qaeda Al Qaeda
[42:32.600 --> 42:37.600]  was used to go after the Serbs Al Qaeda was used to go after the Russians Al Qaeda
[42:37.600 --> 42:42.600]  is used in Africa Al Qaeda Al Qaeda and it's so off the chart though it's so
[42:42.600 --> 42:49.600]  brazen it's so over the top to have Al Qaeda working for the U.S. government
[42:49.600 --> 42:54.600]  but who created Al Qaeda in 1979 the Mujahideen Zabigny Brzezinski who runs the
[42:54.600 --> 43:01.600]  foreign policy of the White House right now Zabigny Brzezinski I mean who could
[43:01.600 --> 43:07.600]  imagine that the National Security Council did a deal with the Iranians to
[43:07.600 --> 43:15.600]  kidnap the hostages as a pretext to then be able to build up a police state here
[43:15.600 --> 43:18.600]  in the U.S. expand the military and then ship them hundreds of millions of
[43:18.600 --> 43:22.600]  dollars in weapons and cash on record that happened Iran Contra is what it's
[43:22.600 --> 43:28.600]  called on record the CIA Solicitor General admitted in congressional
[43:28.600 --> 43:34.600]  hearings in 1996 the CIA ships in cocaine heroin it is a fact ladies and
[43:34.600 --> 43:39.600]  gentlemen and that's who runs our military you've got you know I read
[43:39.600 --> 43:47.600]  online and I watch these videos on YouTube before they pull them where a
[43:47.600 --> 43:50.600]  little kids will get run over by a convoy and their brains will be everywhere
[43:50.600 --> 43:53.600]  and the trucks just keep running over them and then the troops are laughing
[43:53.600 --> 43:59.600]  going yeah look at that stupid little Haji they call them Haji's they had the
[43:59.600 --> 44:07.600]  term gooke for Asians in Vietnam and there's all the videos of troops and
[44:07.600 --> 44:11.600]  contractors just sitting off the road shooting up vans full of families and
[44:11.600 --> 44:15.600]  then going look at the Haji's run look at them die just on major highways
[44:15.600 --> 44:19.600]  killing them and then people say oh how dare you bash the troops this is going
[44:19.600 --> 44:27.600]  on because oh it's those Haji's that attacked us on 9-11 they deserve to die
[44:27.600 --> 44:34.600]  and now these guys are coming home to be homeland security minions in your town
[44:34.600 --> 44:40.600]  they've lost their humanity now a lot of the troops come back and speak out and
[44:40.600 --> 44:44.600]  say no that's why they've had what is it seven times the record suicides the
[44:44.600 --> 44:51.600]  previous record from a war Vietnam seven times the suicides over there because
[44:51.600 --> 44:59.600]  people that have any humanity get their mind and their soul wrecked by this a
[44:59.600 --> 45:04.600]  million three hundred thousand Lancet has always been very accurate the
[45:04.600 --> 45:11.600]  Lancet medical community nonpartisan said over a million and that was three
[45:11.600 --> 45:16.600]  years ago they just put out the fact that there is six times the number of women
[45:16.600 --> 45:20.600]  dying in fire accidents in india that there are anywhere in the world you know
[45:20.600 --> 45:24.600]  why because in india lands about their peck somebody google that I meant to print
[45:24.600 --> 45:28.600]  this morning my printer was out of ink at home Lancet Lancet medical journal
[45:28.600 --> 45:33.600]  report on burnings of women in india lands at report burnings of women in
[45:33.600 --> 45:38.600]  india on a separate issue the point is no one's disputing Lancet's numbers of
[45:38.600 --> 45:44.600]  tens of thousands of women a year being burned to death because it's that there's
[45:44.600 --> 45:50.600]  a billion one hundred something million people in india and women or reliability
[45:50.600 --> 45:55.600]  in india and so people will marry four five six seven eight nine ten women in
[45:55.600 --> 45:59.600]  the course of a decade get the dowry because the family will pay to get rid
[45:59.600 --> 46:05.600]  of their daughter and then they will take the woman tired out in poor gasoline
[46:05.600 --> 46:10.600]  on her and the police take a blind eye because it's cultural and please don't
[46:10.600 --> 46:13.600]  email me saying I'm bashing people in india there's a lot of different groups
[46:13.600 --> 46:16.600]  and sex over there the point is that they need to stop burning the women do
[46:16.600 --> 46:19.600]  you hear the feminist groups crying out against this oh absolutely not
[46:19.600 --> 46:23.600]  feminism's getting sterilized and not having babies and making sure you got
[46:23.600 --> 46:29.600]  to work three or four jobs you can't raise your children so the state can
[46:29.600 --> 46:33.600]  that's what modern feminism is not actually stopping these women not just
[46:33.600 --> 46:38.600]  basic humanity the point is nobody's disputing the landsic medical
[46:38.600 --> 46:43.600]  journal saying that they're burning up all these women in india but but the
[46:43.600 --> 46:46.600]  Pentagon tried to dispute with no evidence later had to admit it was true
[46:46.600 --> 46:51.600]  one million three hundred thousand dead iraqis and now they try to make it
[46:51.600 --> 46:55.600]  illegal in iraq for any of those numbers to be compiled by the public
[46:55.600 --> 47:00.600]  government I don't want that done in my name and if you care about the
[47:00.600 --> 47:05.600]  military and our military's fine history you need to repent for rationalizing
[47:05.600 --> 47:10.600]  this and making jokes about it and all these TV ads you know showing the
[47:10.600 --> 47:14.600]  troops playing soccer with the kids and all these PR things about troops
[47:14.600 --> 47:18.600]  taking care of kids and taking care of dogs and you know taking care of
[47:18.600 --> 47:26.600]  people in iraq a lot of that's true but what is promoted what is supported
[47:26.600 --> 47:37.600]  what is pushed is outright murdering and slaughtering these people so all
[47:37.600 --> 47:40.600]  these good old boys shoot their mouths off yeah let's just parking lot the whole
[47:40.600 --> 47:46.600]  area just murdered all of them they hit us so not alone listen to me you
[47:46.600 --> 47:52.600]  degenerate scumbag wicked devil you need to actually look at the photographs of
[47:52.600 --> 47:56.600]  three-year-olds and five-year-olds with their arms and legs blown off and the
[47:56.600 --> 48:00.600]  video of them and their parents arms as they weep you need to look at that and
[48:00.600 --> 48:04.600]  you need to face what you're doing and I know you do the neocons go on these
[48:04.600 --> 48:10.600]  sites and post comments cheering about it they love it they are totally given
[48:10.600 --> 48:20.600]  over to the darkest elements of the soul our country is run by evil our
[48:20.600 --> 48:25.600]  military is run by evil period and now they're preparing to use it against us
[48:25.600 --> 48:31.600]  I suggest we discredit it now so that we have a chance of reconstituting and
[48:31.600 --> 48:35.600]  under the Republic so that's why they brought in Obama to come make everybody
[48:35.600 --> 48:39.600]  forget about Bush worldwide in the U.S. so the abuses and carnage can continue
[48:39.600 --> 48:49.600]  headline Obama backs Bush on no rights for detainees worldwide Brad in Colorado
[48:49.600 --> 48:55.600]  you're on the air Brad hi Alex I I want to thank you for everything that you're
[48:55.600 --> 49:01.600]  doing in the movement you're a courageous inspiration to all of us and
[49:01.600 --> 49:06.600]  every day it helps me get up and fight a little harder knowing that you're on
[49:06.600 --> 49:12.600]  the air doing what you're doing my wife was in the World Trade Center when the
[49:12.600 --> 49:18.600]  plane set she had just gotten off the path train from New Jersey City and she
[49:18.600 --> 49:24.600]  worked in the complex she had a client in one of the World Trade Centers and I
[49:24.600 --> 49:30.600]  have studied a lot of the aspects of 9-11 needless to say and I try to get more
[49:30.600 --> 49:35.600]  people to list it into the movement and to understand what's going on and one of
[49:35.600 --> 49:39.600]  the areas that I find effective that I just want to pass on to your listeners
[49:39.600 --> 49:46.600]  is that people who have occupations that are kind of out of the mainstream to
[49:46.600 --> 49:52.600]  begin with tend to be more receptive and I've been able to get many chiropractors
[49:52.600 --> 49:57.600]  of all things I'm actually in finance but the chiropractors are much more
[49:57.600 --> 50:02.600]  receptive to listening to this and I find a good way to do this is to go under
[50:02.600 --> 50:08.600]  Richard Gage's architects and engineers for 9-11 truth and just encourage them
[50:08.600 --> 50:12.600]  to look at the PowerPoint presentation because of the way that it's presented
[50:12.600 --> 50:18.600]  in a scientific manner it appeals to kind of what they're looking at but anyone
[50:18.600 --> 50:24.600]  like mercury-free dentists and they come in contact with the public obviously on
[50:24.600 --> 50:29.600]  a daily basis and it's been a good source to kind of know that's great
[50:29.600 --> 50:32.600]  because they're people that come in contact with a lot of folks like you said
[50:32.600 --> 50:36.600]  and also they've already awakened to a lot of the propaganda so I totally agree
[50:36.600 --> 50:42.600]  with you I would just like to encourage that instead of making the case yourself
[50:42.600 --> 50:45.600]  get them to look at architects engineers on the PowerPoint presentation
[50:45.600 --> 50:50.600]  let them do their own work and did your wife survive she did the plane hit she
[50:50.600 --> 50:53.600]  got out of the building stand there I want to hear more about only get back
[50:53.600 --> 51:00.600]  more calls straight ahead tons of news stay with us
[51:00.600 --> 51:04.600]  everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet with
[51:04.600 --> 51:08.600]  so many different methods of consumption how do you choose a simple yet effective
[51:08.600 --> 51:12.600]  way to get your daily intake the friendly knowledgeable folks at North American
[51:12.600 --> 51:18.600]  nutrition have the answer nature's gem premium omega-3 unlike other flax seed
[51:18.600 --> 51:22.600]  our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota providing cooler
[51:22.600 --> 51:26.600]  temperatures and longer summer hours producing the highest quality premium
[51:26.600 --> 51:31.600]  golden flax seed around in addition we selectively harvest and sort flax seeds
[51:31.600 --> 51:35.600]  by size and weight keeping only the best seeds that can produce the highest

[54:18.600 --> 54:25.600]  on you know even in world war two what you can call you know a righteous war
[54:25.600 --> 54:29.600]  until you find out the British war Milner group actually financed Hitler with
[54:29.600 --> 54:33.600]  an aim to destroy Europe to bring the US into a world war to set up world
[54:33.600 --> 54:38.600]  government they set up these crazies when they bombed resident one night five
[54:38.600 --> 54:43.600]  hundred thousand people died you know more people died in a thousand bomber
[54:43.600 --> 54:51.600]  attack about a month before Hiroshima and Nakasaki in nineteen forty five when
[54:51.600 --> 54:56.600]  they dropped incendiary bombs from over eleven hundred aircraft when Japan had
[54:56.600 --> 55:02.600]  no air defenses and over a million people burned to death see and then once you
[55:02.600 --> 55:07.600]  have that cold-blooded attitude that's why general Curtis LeMay when he was later
[55:07.600 --> 55:12.600]  in the joint chiefs of staff in the fifties and that's basically what Dr.
[55:12.600 --> 55:17.600]  Strangelove is based on his dark satire wanted to launch this came out
[55:17.600 --> 55:24.600]  congressional testimony a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia now this is the
[55:24.600 --> 55:29.600]  type of idea then out of Curtis LeMay came general LL Limanser who wanted to
[55:29.600 --> 55:34.600]  hijack jets by remote control bomb DC commit sniper attacks nationwide and
[55:34.600 --> 55:39.600]  blame it on foreign enemies that's ABC news Baltimore Sun can read the
[55:39.600 --> 55:43.600]  document operation Northwood's that was in the sixties then there's over two
[55:43.600 --> 55:46.600]  hundred declassified stage government terror attacks that the government admits
[55:46.600 --> 55:52.600]  they stage it's an army training manuals for captains we've posted at
[55:52.600 --> 55:58.600]  prisonplanet.com and infowars.com so once you know that then you understand how
[55:58.600 --> 56:03.600]  they can just shoot Iraqi children and laugh and call them Haji's it's that
[56:03.600 --> 56:11.600]  mindset that trickled down that rolled down the hill and they're trying to
[56:11.600 --> 56:14.600]  convert the military over to this mindset now the good news is the majority of
[56:14.600 --> 56:20.600]  the military is not like that but the leadership is and protects the bad guys
[56:20.600 --> 56:23.600]  instead of keeping the military clean because they want to corrupt the
[56:23.600 --> 56:27.600]  military why do you think the Pentagon on record gave out more than sixty
[56:27.600 --> 56:32.600]  billion dollars and that was as of three years ago in giant pallets of cash a
[56:32.600 --> 56:37.600]  private gets thirty grand a master sergeant might get a couple hundred
[56:37.600 --> 56:41.600]  grand colonels get millions it's to corrupt them and they could say hey
[56:41.600 --> 56:49.600]  you took that money it's disgusting they've created a mercenary army of
[56:49.600 --> 56:55.600]  lawless criminals within our own government Hitler did the same thing
[56:55.600 --> 57:09.600]  the German military hey some good news the thirty first state has introduced

[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:53.600]  else yes um you know i'm sitting there reading about the alamo and i could tell
[1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:56.600]  you one thing i was all inspired because uh... even though they were outnumbered
[1:00:56.600 --> 1:01:00.600]  by the mexican army days they stood their ground and they even though they all
[1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:05.600]  died they would not succeed they were not a battle a dictator and that's something
[1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:12.600]  that listeners should take in their minds absolutely and you know they made
[1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:16.600]  that watered down whitewash kind of demonizing the folks at the alamo
[1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:20.600]  a few years ago and it was a dismal failure a no amount of media propaganda
[1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:24.600]  against those men that died is going to work and we salute the defenders of the
[1:01:24.600 --> 1:01:29.600]  alamo today thanks for reminding me well also too is like my wife's descent my
[1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:34.600]  wife's descendants of proper to texas independence and she's his panic and i
[1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:38.600]  go down to the cemetery in west columbia and you see some hispanic graves
[1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:42.600]  there fighting for texas independence though it's not a great thing well
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:46.600]  the person that wrote the texas constitution and is known as the father
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:54.600]  of texas uh... was hispanic and thirty plus percent of the signers
[1:01:54.600 --> 1:01:58.600]  uh... were hispanic and over thirty percent that fought in the war were hispanic
[1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:04.600]  santa anna was a dictator they had a bunch of dictators beforeings and
[1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:10.600]  they had kicked the imperial government of the austrian-hungarian empire
[1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:14.600]  well they were german royalty basically but it was a larger empire out
[1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:20.600]  max a million and others and that's why santa anna came up here and was
[1:02:20.600 --> 1:02:23.600]  trying to kick people out that had paid for their land and you know paid for
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:27.600]  the grants unlike my family on both sides and so that's the truth of what
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:32.600]  happened and and again the globalist love demonizing texas love making up all
[1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:35.600]  these lies about texas but it's just not going to work

[1:08:12.600 --> 1:08:27.600]  continuing with wide open phones we're gonna go to Pierre en masse you're on the
[1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:36.600]  ear sir go ahead Pierre how are you good I'd like to call in and first of all
[1:08:36.600 --> 1:08:39.600]  thank you for showing that about two years ago where you talked about the
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:43.600]  wheels on wheels and taking care of your grandparents and the older folk
[1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:48.600]  after my mother passed away when I was 18 my father was considerably older than
[1:08:48.600 --> 1:08:53.600]  most other fathers of people my age I stayed home and took care of them and
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:59.600]  that that show really hit a hard chord for me and I really appreciate that
[1:08:59.600 --> 1:09:03.600]  because I'm you know I up until last year when he passed away I was there
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:07.600]  very often take care of him and always worrying about him and looking out for
[1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:11.600]  him everything today is about living for yourself not taking care of your
[1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:16.600]  children right warehousing old people not visiting them and you lose your
[1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:21.600]  humanity when you do that you and and just like I talked about the military
[1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:25.600]  and slaughtering all these men women and children in Iraq and other places
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:30.600]  you know losing our humanity then others will do that to us because they've lost
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:34.600]  their humanity to you know when you're older when you're sick or when you have
[1:09:34.600 --> 1:09:37.600]  a stroke or when you're in a car wreck you know there's so many of these
[1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:40.600]  good old boys and people that don't care about their families or other people
[1:09:40.600 --> 1:09:43.600]  all they care about is acting cool and partying and then when they get
[1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:48.600]  paralyzed or they get hurt and nobody takes care of them you reap what you
[1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:52.600]  sow but when you take care of other people and when you are a humanitarian
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:55.600]  you grow that's when you blossom that's when you become what you're really
[1:09:55.600 --> 1:10:01.600]  meant to be so all these people that are that are you know totally selfish
[1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:04.600]  and only care about themselves they are cheating themselves out of something
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:10.600]  wonderful well that's why I've I've taken up my personal fight which is
[1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:13.600]  cancer and health issues they both unfortunately pass away from cancer
[1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:19.600]  I'm only 25 I'm a student at the UMass in Amherst and I just see the rates
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:24.600]  going up more people in obituaries in a daily paper younger younger ages all
[1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:29.600]  the time and what you said last week about not donating to these disease
[1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:34.600]  research foundations or the organ dysfunction foundation whatever part of
[1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:37.600]  body it is you know put that money in something better put it in something
[1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:42.600]  that's gonna actually help people well those groups when you really study it
[1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:46.600]  at the top there eugenics organizations and they're actually there to make
[1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:51.600]  sure real treatments don't actually get to the people and because it's simple
[1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:57.600]  by the year 1930 worldwide eugenics was everything almost every major scientist
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:03.600]  I'd say 95% was a eugenicist it was the accepted system and the leadership
[1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:06.600]  of the planet the robber barons believed in it and so they trained the next
[1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:12.600]  generation and so running parallel along with our society are these killers
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:16.600]  that that don't just not care about killing people they think killing and
[1:11:16.600 --> 1:11:20.600]  maiming is a good thing and they make money off of it and they have all these
[1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:24.600]  compartmentalized individuals that work for them who don't realize the bigger
[1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:28.600]  program because it's so horrible you know that's one leg up the enemy has on
[1:11:28.600 --> 1:11:32.600]  us is that their program of control is so horrible that people have trouble
[1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:36.600]  just even being able to admit it to themselves well that's why we spoke
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:40.600]  about the Rockefeller's taking over the major cancer treatment cancer research
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:45.600]  hospitals in the 20s and 30s I've read Gerber Griffin's book well about cancer
[1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:48.600]  the story of vitamin B17 where he goes into the history and what's there now
[1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:52.600]  listing as a drug so you can't get it well yeah I mean I've had to go through
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:56.600]  some hurdles to get even the raw apricot seeds just to eat and you have to
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:59.600]  make sure that they weren't passed an extra machine during shipment and things
[1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:02.600]  like that because then you know that can affect the the quality everything but
[1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:07.600]  you have a food component that's supposed to be in our diet it's not our diet anymore
[1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:11.600]  and and along with everything else you've spoken about in my opinion that's a great
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:15.600]  reason why it's gone up I've just been so so angry at the same time at these
[1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:20.600]  people who have co-opted you know the good doctors the good scientists and
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:25.600]  nurses and all those people who are you know on the trail of of the actual root
[1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:28.600]  cause and then they swoop in and say no no more we're gonna have to put you on
[1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:33.600]  the licenses you're gonna go this way which is drugs and apathic means which
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:37.600]  you know failed my parents failed three of my grandparents failed on top of
[1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:40.600]  mine and countless other people out there that while they're also trying to put
[1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:44.600]  out a lot of spin right now that cancer has actually gone down every major
[1:12:44.600 --> 1:12:49.600]  form of cancer has exploded if you really look at the news announcements
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:55.600]  the treatment you know they claim a few percentage points better results with
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:13:00.600]  the treatment but the overall numbers when I saw a report two years ago just one
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:05.600]  where women's lung cancer has gone up seven fold despite the fact that women's
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:10.600]  smoking has gone way down the last 30 years it's just incredible it's just
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:14.600]  absolutely incredible anything else that's basically it I just want to say
[1:13:14.600 --> 1:13:19.600]  your sponsors are great might as resources Ted Anderson his his associate
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:22.600]  there Mike I've dealt with over the past couple years is great
[1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:26.600]  Berkey filled as I'm drinking the water right now and Marty Schachter over at
[1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:30.600]  Cal Bend great great gentleman my father and him are from the same generation
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:34.600]  have you bought gold a few years ago from my this I guess your investments
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:39.600]  doubled in value pretty close to that yes amazing hey good to hear from you my
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:46.600]  friend let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Chicago Steve go ahead yes Alex
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:51.600]  at two Chicago Sun Times articles one came out yesterday it's entitled
[1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:58.600]  Farrakhan followers must continue Obama energy very farrakhan admits that he
[1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:03.600]  laid low the laughing high unit to deceive the white people it was a big
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:07.600]  rally that they had at Rosemont of course father Flager was there and he was
[1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:12.600]  laughing and clapping according to the Sun Times article the other one that
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:17.600]  really disturbed me because I shop at this place an overnight employee at the
[1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:22.600]  Walmart at this is also in the Chicago Sun Times a Walmart employee dies after
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:27.600]  setting self on fire he walked out of the store into the parking lot he's on
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:31.600]  the overnight shift it says there he said he couldn't take it anymore he
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:36.600]  tossed himself with that lighter fluid set himself on fire 10 people tried to
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:42.600]  help him no he didn't want help he ended up a day later dying of his burns I
[1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:48.600]  mean I exploitation of workers and then capitalism thanks Alex alright I
[1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:56.600]  appreciate your call you know Lewis Farrakhan his real name's Calypso
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:15:00.600]  Louie that's interesting name Calypso Louie saxophone player pretty famous
[1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:05.600]  one in his own right there very complex person you know he has carried
[1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:10.600]  a lot of patriot books about the New World Order he has covered the New World
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:16.600]  Order he covers a lot of important issues but especially if you go back to
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:21.600]  speeches you know 10 20 years ago they are very racist I mean you could take
[1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:25.600]  what he's saying and superimpose it over you know what white supremacists would
[1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:31.600]  be saying I will say this we have a lot of nation of Islam listeners of this
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:35.600]  show and they've contacted me they've called me they've walked me on the
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:39.600]  street they said look we know Barack Obama's a shell in the front man who
[1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:43.600]  works for the New World Order and we don't know why Lewis Farrakhan is
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:47.600]  supporting him well Lewis Farrakhan's a politician more than anything and he
[1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:51.600]  runs a very powerful group and he knows that that's where the hype is that's
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:54.600]  where everything's going so he's gone along with it just like Pat Robertson the
[1:15:54.600 --> 1:16:00.600]  leader probably the number one leader of Protestants in the world with the
[1:16:00.600 --> 1:16:06.600]  James Dobson who just retired last Friday but you don't see James Dobson
[1:16:06.600 --> 1:16:10.600]  saying socialism's good we should accept it and do whatever Obama says you do
[1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:17.600]  see that happening with Pat Robertson and so when you see all these powerful
[1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:22.600]  people getting behind something in the establishment you've got to really
[1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:28.600]  really worry about that let's go ahead and talk to Nate in Maine Nate you're
[1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:33.600]  on the air hello Alex hello I have a question are you aware of this film
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:40.600]  going around the internet called the fourth world war no I'm not it's a
[1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:45.600]  seemingly anti-globalist film and it exposes a lot about NAFTA and GATT and
[1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:52.600]  it talks about the things that happened in Argentina in 2002 and I was looking
[1:16:52.600 --> 1:16:57.600]  at the end credits late late late earlier today and I realized it was
[1:16:57.600 --> 1:17:01.600]  funded by the Rockefeller and Jerome Foundation is there anything you can
[1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:04.600]  tell me about those two foundations well I know that the Rockefeller
[1:17:04.600 --> 1:17:08.600]  Foundation is the most wicked foundation out there the Jerome Foundation
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:11.600]  I've heard of I know it's a globalist organization don't know that much about
[1:17:11.600 --> 1:17:18.600]  it but I'll have to watch it but what we have happening with the globalist is
[1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:22.600]  an attempt through Glenn Beck and a lot of other people to co-op the Liberty
[1:17:22.600 --> 1:17:26.600]  or Patriot movement to get people trusting their groups and their leaders
[1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:32.600]  so they can then do a 180 later so that I mean they know this information
[1:17:32.600 --> 1:17:37.600]  right now is just rising and exploding and gaining huge understanding and
[1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:41.600]  awakening but I really can't comment on a film I haven't seen what's it called
[1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:45.600]  again the fourth world war yeah fourth world war it's right on YouTube and
[1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:50.600]  Google but but what's their solution a global government at the end to save
[1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:56.600]  us from the fourth world war it does talk about one world and towards the
[1:17:56.600 --> 1:17:59.600]  end it kind of makes you want to get out and be violent I think that I think
[1:17:59.600 --> 1:18:05.600]  they're trying to incite violence with this film I'll have I'll have curtain
[1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:09.600]  and Emma or Paul Watson watch it new report I'm too busy with a bunch of stuff
[1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:13.600]  right now to I mean literally every hour is just packed with work but what
[1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:18.600]  are you gonna say yeah I was just gonna say I think that's their main goal
[1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:22.600]  with this film is to make people violent because it really it really hikes
[1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:27.600]  the the street violence and you know going after the cops and it shows people
[1:18:27.600 --> 1:18:32.600]  fire-bombing right sure that they don't just link to things for people to look
[1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:36.600]  at or are you sure it says it was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation yeah
[1:18:36.600 --> 1:18:40.600]  right at the end credit does it look like a foundation or does it say
[1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:44.600]  Rockefeller Brothers Foundation no just Rockefeller Foundation that's really
[1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:50.600]  horrible news thanks for the call I do know they're having people like Zbigniew
[1:18:50.600 --> 1:18:56.600]  Brzezinski and others come out on MSNBC in fact John I keep meaning to play that
[1:18:56.600 --> 1:19:02.600]  I gave you that like two weeks ago do you have the you know okay get that ready
[1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:06.600]  and also get that other clip ready with Soros submitting there that they've
[1:19:06.600 --> 1:19:10.600]  lowered the oil prices to bankrupt the nations the oil producing nations all
[1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:14.600]  over the world to intensify the depression so I want to play those we write a note
[1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:26.600]  now or I'll forget Brzezinski and Soros you know let me forget that
[1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:30.600]  I'll talk about this when we get back because it's so important it's it's
[1:19:30.600 --> 1:19:36.600]  vital to what the establishment is doing and how we counter them I mean it's
[1:19:36.600 --> 1:19:42.600]  the same thing you see with zeitgeist they tell you yes that there's a
[1:19:42.600 --> 1:19:44.600]  horrible tyranny yes the banks are corrupt yes all these bad things are
[1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:48.600]  happening the answer is a violent revolution and then there'll be a one
[1:19:48.600 --> 1:19:52.600]  world government that comes after that that's their plan it's they're trying
[1:19:52.600 --> 1:19:56.600]  to be on both sides of the fence it's like they fund both sides in any war
[1:19:56.600 --> 1:20:06.600]  once finally get back in these uncertain times safety and precaution are key

[1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:03.600]  there have been some big developments during the last few breaks on other
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:08.600]  National Guard mock gun confiscation drills going on around the country in
[1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:14.600]  Virginia and other areas West Virginia I am vetting these reports right now
[1:24:14.600 --> 1:24:20.600]  but it's just like the Arcadia Iowa where they're going to lock the town down
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:26.600]  and go door-to-door asking if they can search for your family
[1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:30.600]  and they call it a drill getting the police the military everybody
[1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:34.600]  acclimated for this but we are vetting some new big developments
[1:24:34.600 --> 1:24:38.600]  I mean they do these drills all the time it's in the news all the time that's
[1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:42.600]  what goes on during the drills it's just it deals specifically with firearms
[1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:47.600]  confiscation now so we'll be tracking that and going over that I'm going to
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:51.600]  come back and take calls the next second but right now I wanted to comment on
[1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:56.600]  what the caller was saying dealing with the way the media and prime ministers
[1:24:56.600 --> 1:25:00.600]  and presidents all the world keeps saying there's going to be riots there's going
[1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:03.600]  to be horrible riots they're going to take over governments they're going to
[1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:07.600]  destroy everything and in Iceland the government's fallen several Eastern
[1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:13.600]  European nations have fallen in the last month and you have peace and
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:23.600]  peaceful people coming out protesting demonstrating demanding government
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:28.600]  resign that's been happening but we've caught the establishment in Italy
[1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:32.600]  in the United States and Canada in Russia many other nations where the police
[1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:36.600]  will dress up like demonstrators attack other police so the police have a
[1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:40.600]  pretext that's a false flag attack it's a staged event to be able to go after
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:45.600]  the peaceful crowds and arrest them and fire rubber bullets at them and the
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:51.600]  rest of it well now we have all these world leaders saying they're going to be
[1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:56.600]  violent saying they're going to be bad saying that the government's got to do
[1:25:56.600 --> 1:26:04.600]  something about it ahead of time really to try to put the idea in people's
[1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:09.600]  minds to do this because then they can put the military on the streets to stop
[1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:13.600]  the riots and it will look legitimate and then set the precedent of being
[1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:17.600]  under military occupation and that's what the IMF and World Bank documents that
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:24.600]  were leaked out of the World Bank in late 2001 2002 stated they call it in their
[1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:29.600]  own documents the IMF riot where they destroy the economy after a few months
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:33.600]  or longer things implode then the people start rioting the government
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:38.600]  provocateurs rioting then all confidence is lost and even healthy companies
[1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:42.600]  go under then the banks can come in tell the government okay we're going to
[1:26:42.600 --> 1:26:46.600]  bail you out but we basically own you now in the future and they bail the
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:51.600]  country out with more fiat currency so this is a program this is a stated
[1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:56.600]  operation but here's the story today out of the Daily Express out of England MI5
[1:26:56.600 --> 1:27:02.600]  that's their internal spy force MI5 alerted on bank riots top secret
[1:27:02.600 --> 1:27:06.600]  contingency plans have been drawn up to counter the threat posed by a summer of
[1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:12.600]  discontent a summer of rage in Britain the double whamming of the most of the
[1:27:12.600 --> 1:27:16.600]  worst economic crisis and living memory in a motley crew of political extremists
[1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:23.600]  it's their fault determined to stir up civil disorder has led to the extraordinary
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:29.600]  step of the army being put on standby see the drug war causes Mexico to collapse
[1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:34.600]  now we've got to be under martial law oh now the bankers cause the collapse but
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:40.600]  it's the extremist fault it's the protesters fault so MI5 is so upset
[1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:45.600]  they're having to get ready for military rule in England oh they're so upset
[1:27:45.600 --> 1:27:49.600]  military just hate setting up dictatorships they just do it constantly all over
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:54.600]  the world they just hate getting all this power it's so terrible so they can
[1:27:54.600 --> 1:27:58.600]  loot even more for the banker masters MI5 and special brands are targeting
[1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:02.600]  activists they fear could inflame anger over job losses and payouts to failed
[1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:07.600]  bankers and over and over again in my film police it to the takeover we show
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:10.600]  the Seattle riots we have sixty thousand peaceful demonstrators protesting
[1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:14.600]  IMF and World Bank the World Trade Organization so on record this is in
[1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:18.600]  the Seattle Post intelligence or Seattle Times we have police on tape admitting
[1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:24.600]  it they hire the army hires and big foundations pay for and fly in from
[1:28:24.600 --> 1:28:30.600]  Oregon anarchists that were trained at a big Ford Foundation compound then the
[1:28:30.600 --> 1:28:33.600]  anarchist are housed in a government building protected by police they're
[1:28:33.600 --> 1:28:39.600]  brought out to attack police that's put on national news then that goes on for
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:43.600]  a day the police say hey we're not allowed to defend ourselves it's terrible the
[1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:47.600]  news media points out the police are standing down as bottles and rocks hit
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:51.600]  them then the anarchist pulled back move into the government building under
[1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:59.600]  protection being protected by the government and what happens next they
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:03.600]  attack the peaceful sixty thousand people there's video police stomping old
[1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:06.600]  ladies breaking their collar bones going into neighborhoods attacking
[1:29:06.600 --> 1:29:11.600]  everybody it is just powerful so see that's how this works they want the
[1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:17.600]  riots and they will make them violent they want cities to burn like the LA
[1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:23.600]  riots so they can bring in control one of the most notorious anarchist
[1:29:23.600 --> 1:29:28.600]  websites class war asked how to keep warm during the credit crunch burn a
[1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:32.600]  banker and the bankers will be out of your country they're they're running
[1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:35.600]  things and I would bet my bottom dollar that that group isn't just infiltrated
[1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:39.600]  that it's run just like the IRA by British intelligence we'll come back

[1:34:12.600 --> 1:34:16.600]  with their children with baby carriages out there protesting the globalists in
[1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:22.600]  the banks and so always the aircraft land fully paid for by foundations the
[1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:27.600]  anarchist pile off I'm not saying all the anarchists but it's on record that
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:32.600]  certain key groups of them dress like clowns and they'll always go do silly
[1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:37.600]  things for the news cameras they're doing rituals you know and and and things
[1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:41.600]  like that and the news will only give them attention the little weird little
[1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:45.600]  rituals and things saying they're levitating mince or whatever in the
[1:34:45.600 --> 1:34:48.600]  case of Denver and then all of that discredits and there's other government
[1:34:48.600 --> 1:34:53.600]  control groups that then carry out violence and in that way they can
[1:34:53.600 --> 1:35:00.600]  demonize the legitimate protesters and so yes in the United States in
[1:35:00.600 --> 1:35:04.600]  England it's on record they're preparing for martial law army war college in my
[1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:13.600]  five both countries it's admitted Canada is ready it's all been set up it's
[1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:21.600]  been set up to sell the population on getting ready for martial law and as
[1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:25.600]  people lose their homes as there's more homeless people as there's more crime
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:28.600]  well hey the police are just pulling you over at this checkpoint to make sure
[1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:32.600]  not a criminal or don't have any weapons and we're being inducted into slavery
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:36.600]  and the police are being brainwashed in condition and and and you know given all
[1:35:36.600 --> 1:35:45.600]  of these excuses to go along with this in fact let's go ahead and play from MSNBC
[1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:52.600]  so we can break it down this clip of Zabigny Brzezinski about two weeks ago
[1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:55.600]  I never got to playing it where he's talking about oh I'm so angry with what
[1:35:55.600 --> 1:35:58.600]  the banks have done oh I'm so angry what the elites have done I'm afraid there's
[1:35:58.600 --> 1:36:02.600]  going to be revolution and then Glenn Beck says the same thing what about the
[1:36:02.600 --> 1:36:06.600]  bubble affecting their guns and the CIA is like we're ready for that to happen
[1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:12.600]  let it happen this is all part of things collapsing meanwhile now they're putting
[1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:16.600]  Ron Paul in the news meanwhile they're you know they're making it all very
[1:36:16.600 --> 1:36:22.600]  mainstream so that the mainstream media can keep a little bit of its credibility
[1:36:22.600 --> 1:36:26.600]  and oppose like they're with the people and that they're not with the elite
[1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:29.600]  and then oh goodness gracious look what happened with the riots oh look what
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:35.600]  happened we had to confiscate the guns you know society broke down so it's
[1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:41.600]  very very troubling but we're aware of this you know now every time the police
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:46.600]  attack police we catch them in Canada last year in Denver last year they're
[1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:53.600]  all over Europe it's now mainstream news and every major activist group in
[1:36:53.600 --> 1:36:58.600]  England that does engage in violence and does call for violence the reason you
[1:36:58.600 --> 1:37:01.600]  know they're feds is because time and time again it's come out that they are
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:04.600]  working for the British government or the Australian government or the Canadian
[1:37:04.600 --> 1:37:07.600]  government or the German government I remember it's in several of my films
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:11.600]  what the Masters of Terror has a bunch of articles in it mainstreamed or Spiegel
[1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:18.600]  Reuters you know German news that every major white supremacist group that go
[1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:26.600]  out and firebomb Turks and others it turns out aren't just infiltrated by
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:34.600]  German intelligence they are run by German intelligence and then notice they
[1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:37.600]  don't get in trouble that's always the telltale sign I mean if you're not a
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:43.600]  fed and you get on the radio or you go on a website and you say let's kill these
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:56.600]  cops a grand jury indicts you and the police come and arrest you okay but if
[1:37:56.600 --> 1:38:01.600]  you are a fed you can just do this with impunity and their favorite thing to do
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:06.600]  is to find street kids in Miami or young you know 15 to 20 year old in a group
[1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:13.600]  of Muslim youth in Toronto last year I guess now two years ago and it later
[1:38:13.600 --> 1:38:17.600]  comes out that the feds the Mounties in that case or the FBI in the case of
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:21.600]  Miami they'll find a group of profiled welfare street kids they give them
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:25.600]  hundreds of thousands of dollars they give them a warehouse apartments they
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:30.600]  weren't even Muslims with the group of black street kids in Miami and it took
[1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:34.600]  them a year and a half to just get them every time they say okay 50,000 more if
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:37.600]  you'll just say you're no longer Rasta Christians if you'll say you're Muslims
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:44.600]  and wear these military uniforms 100,000 more for the 10 of you if you will go
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:49.600]  videotape with this video camera the federal building in Miami they had a
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:53.600]  case last year what was it in Ohio of Muslim extremists that were going to
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:57.600]  attack US military bases then it came out later that the informant was a CIA
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:39:03.600]  slash FBI operative and that he went and found the group created the group and
[1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:10.600]  was leading the group there was a Bumster award in 1998 it's in police state to
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:15.600]  the takeover that's a big insult in Texas number one prize they give out I think
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:22.600]  20 Bumster awards and they gave the FBI a Bumster award for creating a clan
[1:39:22.600 --> 1:39:27.600]  group out of two different trailers two husband and wives who literally were such
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:32.600]  alcoholics on welfare they couldn't even get out of bed most of the time and they
[1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:36.600]  talked about we're going to take over the White House and be kings we're going
[1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:42.600]  to blow up this chemical plant we're going to lead a revolution we're going to
[1:39:42.600 --> 1:39:45.600]  blow up airplanes just just all this with you know like little kids talking
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:49.600]  about I'm Superman and I'm going to jump over buildings with a single bound
[1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:53.600]  remember last year the white supremacist in Tennessee what 17 and 18 year old
[1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:57.600]  with the machine guns and shaved heads on my space and they were going to wear
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:01.600]  white tuxedos with white top hats and they were going to drive down the street
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:07.600]  and kill all the FBI and Secret Service and you know get Obama and they were
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:12.600]  going to then go to the White House and it's always the same mindset they find
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:20.600]  mentally ill unstable people and they set them up and it's the same story in
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:24.600]  England where it turned out that every major IRA subgroup wasn't just
[1:40:24.600 --> 1:40:31.600]  infiltrated it they were founded and commanded you know in one cell the three
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:37.600]  leaders of it would actually kneecap shoot members in the knee who wouldn't go
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:45.600]  out and commit bombings so you've got in my five in my six SAS commandos kneecapping
[1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:51.600]  members of the irish republican army if they won't go out and stage terror attacks
[1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:57.600]  in England and Ireland that is main stream British news and when it started
[1:40:57.600 --> 1:41:01.600]  coming out four years ago they put D notices out in England they have an order
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:07.600]  where any website any any news story any TV station or network is told D notice
[1:41:07.600 --> 1:41:11.600]  and they can't report on it and they can't even report they were given the D
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:16.600]  notice but it always leaks out they declared national security look at the
[1:41:16.600 --> 1:41:21.600]  Bernard Madoff case in Congress within with the securities and exchange
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:24.600]  commission they said why did you have when you were warned for nine years he was
[1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:30.600]  doing this why did you stand down and they declared national security act and
[1:41:30.600 --> 1:41:36.600]  they declared presidential power not to answer that's a government operation he
[1:41:36.600 --> 1:41:45.600]  was just a frontman so this is done over and over and over and over again
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:53.600]  so many times I'll have a film screening at a movie theater or I'll be at an
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:59.600]  event and I'll be in the hotel restaurant eating and somebody will walk up to me

[1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:09.600]  infiltrating these groups and it comes out totally illegal and you know it's one
[1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:12.600]  thing if they're going to infiltrate some peace group that's totally peaceful
[1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:16.600]  like Michael more covers and fair 9-9-11 you know that's baking cookies a bunch
[1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:21.600]  of Star Trek nerds basically but then they always want them to do violence you
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:28.600]  see infiltrating is bad enough with the military or state police but to then
[1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:34.600]  always have them and folks I was trying to build a veteran in 1998 joke and
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:37.600]  panties since the World War two that they were going to bulldoze this house we
[1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:40.600]  wanted to fix it they said they'd arrested so we fixed it we said file a
[1:44:40.600 --> 1:44:44.600]  bill in the new house record 14 days totally built furnished home and thanks

[1:44:48.600 --> 1:44:55.600]  contractors built it and volunteers put it together and I had cops in plain
[1:44:55.600 --> 1:44:59.600]  clothes come on the property twice and say let's let's kill cops let's go out
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:02.600]  for city council people this is wrong what's happening he'd follow him out

[1:45:08.600 --> 1:45:12.600]  military type guys that's what you see 90% of the time the rest of the time
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:15.600]  you'll see him with like a little beanie cap with the fake artist you know
[1:45:15.600 --> 1:45:19.600]  curly hair and a mustache it's always the same type you know kind of their
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:22.600]  hippie outfit and when I was at Bilderberg in 2006 after they'd already
[1:45:22.600 --> 1:45:25.600]  detained us so we're going to jail and all this it got out in the media so they
[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:29.600]  had to release it for 15 hours being interrogated I show up at Bilderberg
[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:34.600]  and they're huge FBI type Royal Mounted Police type six foot four clean cut
[1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:39.600]  36 years old you know I'm like oh here comes the Royal Mounted Police I
[1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:42.600]  didn't say that and he was like so what are you planning Alex what you do and

[1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:57.600]  like oh just and they and they'll come right out of character in just a minute
[1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:00.600]  you know not say I'm a feather go I'm just checking man you know it's my job
[1:46:00.600 --> 1:46:08.600]  you know and you're just like come on come on and then one guy even the police
[1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:12.600]  aren't as uptight I guess in Canada there was these woods across the street with
[1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:17.600]  these geese and stuff a pond and the police would go urinate when they
[1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:21.600]  want to have to go in the hotel go through security the Royal Mounted Police
[1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:25.600]  regular Ottawa police and their cars they would go urinate behind that the
[1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:29.600]  bushes across the street and I was even over there once you know with them at
[1:46:29.600 --> 1:46:34.600]  the same time and that the feds even run over for pointing out when I'm over
[1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:38.600]  there to other cops and the cops just wave their hands you know so like
[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:44.600]  look he's peeing over there he's peeing behind those bushes and get him get him
[1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:47.600]  because the hotel is out there in the middle of nowhere just a few defense
[1:46:47.600 --> 1:46:52.600]  contractor buildings around there with geese stomping around the parking lot
[1:46:52.600 --> 1:47:02.600]  honking at us and guard dogs but then you know you'll see all these other
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:08.600]  feds walking around going let's blow things up I want a neutron bomb I want
[1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:13.600]  to blow them up with a bomb and then you see the other feds just watching to
[1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:20.600]  see what we'll say and I'm like come on man stop it get out of here and they
[1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:24.600]  turned to go I'm just so mad I just want to kill all of them if that guy
[1:47:24.600 --> 1:47:29.600]  wasn't a fed he'd be arrested right there on the spot this is dangerous
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:36.600]  folks we have people trying to set us up every single day that's why I pay all
[1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:41.600]  the taxes follow every law don't even speed and everything the best I can
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:44.600]  because if they're going to set me up it's going to be a complete setup
[1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:50.600]  take Tommy Chong he sold water pipes his son did using his name they tried
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:53.600]  three times to get employees hired there's a few cities in the U.S. were
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:59.600]  illegal to mail those to those cities then it becomes a federal offense even
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:03.600]  though it's city law some interstate commerce thing they would catch these
[1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:07.600]  feds you know many states away in California trying to ship to other
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:14.600]  towns in the U.S. and they'd fire them well finally one of the feds went in
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:19.600]  mail the water pipe to the town everything against orders and they went
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:22.600]  and arrested Tommy Chong he spent several years in prison for it and they
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:26.600]  admitted in court yeah we shut him up we came in and the feds folks under
[1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:31.600]  their corrupt laws could come in my office and mail out whatever they
[1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:35.600]  wanted and you know hang grenades whatever and say I did it and we need
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:39.600]  to have on record that we're nonviolent we don't have any legal weapons we're
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:46.600]  not doing anything here but I know the way they'll come at me I know the type
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:55.600]  of stuff they'll do because we have a completely clean nose here but this
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:00.600]  is what we're dealing with this is what we face this is what we go through to
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:04.600]  bring you the films the radio show the websites the information we bring
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:11.600]  forward on this show let's talk to Clay in Texas Clare on the air hey Alex
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:15.600]  how's it going man good sir hey I was just I want to make a point about
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:19.600]  freedom and how you know one of the key elements of freedom is you know being
[1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:25.600]  able to live without fear and I grew up in Central Texas probably not far from
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:28.600]  where you are now and it's the whole town called Hado and I hadn't been there
[1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:32.600]  in a couple of years and I was driving through there and it's changed so much
[1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:36.600]  but one thing I noticed is that there's all these billboards of missing
[1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:43.600]  American girls and I just wonder I mean like at what point do we say federal
[1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:48.600]  government y'all really are failing us here in the state of Texas yeah they do
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:53.600]  that signs of this terrorist signs of this wanted felon signs of this kidnapped
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:49:57.600]  person so it's an app and half the billboards in Texas in other areas of
[1:49:57.600 --> 1:50:02.600]  the country I travel to are now tattletale billboards government loves you billboards
[1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:08.600]  spy billboards we are living in an Orwellian state it is so obvious and you
[1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:11.600]  know they don't tell all these women getting kidnapped and flown off to third
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:14.600]  world countries to be raped and killed that's where a lot of them are going they
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:17.600]  don't tell them buy a gun they don't tell them defend yourselves they don't tell
[1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:20.600]  them get a taser or get some pepper spray they don't they don't want our women
[1:50:20.600 --> 1:50:24.600]  defending themselves and they also want to create the illusion that kidnapping is
[1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:27.600]  up in this country when it's actually way down unless you're in one of the
[1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:31.600]  cities where people are being kidnapped and taken to Mexico and in the case of
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:35.600]  several south Texas towns they've had hundreds of women come up missing and
[1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:38.600]  they are found where their hearts cut out you can Google this mainstream news
[1:50:38.600 --> 1:50:43.600]  satanic ritual murders anything else sir
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:52.600]  folks I'm not kidding Google satanic ritual murders Texas border a few years ago
[1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:57.600]  in El Paso they dug up over 200 women with their hearts chopped out but that's
[1:50:57.600 --> 1:51:00.600]  way down in the article it's kind of by the way their hearts were chopped out
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:05.600]  companies continue to lay off thousands of people unemployment is the highest
[1:51:05.600 --> 1:51:10.600]  it's been in over 30 years statistics prove that in a recession crime rates
[1:51:10.600 --> 1:51:15.600]  go up everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim
[1:51:15.600 --> 1:51:20.600]  in these difficult and trying times you need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper

[2:02:04.600 --> 2:02:07.600]  break down from your you know great expertise one of the most informed
[2:02:07.600 --> 2:02:12.600]  people out there what's really happening in Mexico are they in civil war going
[2:02:12.600 --> 2:02:19.600]  towards the war is it collapsing will it collapse Mexico is not a failed state
[2:02:19.600 --> 2:02:25.600]  that is people go to work every morning the subways run the taxis pick up
[2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:32.600]  fares and so forth what is happening is that there are enclaves of violence
[2:02:32.600 --> 2:02:39.600]  where you have dual sovereignty that is on the one hand the elected officials
[2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:47.600]  have a piece of the action but they're often outmaneuvered and outgunned by
[2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:53.600]  the cartels and you see this in cities like waters which is just across the
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:03:00.600]  border from El Paso you see it in the Tijuana just across the border from San
[2:03:00.600 --> 2:03:07.600]  Diego and in areas in states like Guerrero and Michoacan where the
[2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:14.600]  government simply has lost control over its own territory and I see a lot of
[2:03:14.600 --> 2:03:19.600]  reports that all especially on the border but all over Mexico that their sub
[2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:25.600]  taxing systems where where the gangs and criminals demand taxes from businesses
[2:03:25.600 --> 2:03:33.600]  and teachers and and and even government people that's right and they don't just
[2:03:33.600 --> 2:03:40.600]  send you a notice if your taxes overdue they shoot you and they're not confining
[2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:47.600]  this to public entities although some mayors are having to pay taxes to make
[2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:53.600]  certain that the citizens in their municipalities are not victimized but
[2:03:53.600 --> 2:04:02.600]  surgeons are a target veterinarians teachers even street vendors have to pay
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:10.600]  their dame gales their dues to the cartels or risk being executed and as you've
[2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:16.600]  read the executions are occurring in an increasingly ghastly fashion with
[2:04:16.600 --> 2:04:23.600]  castrations and decapitations and shoving people in vats of lie

[2:08:06.600 --> 2:08:14.600]  radio network professor George W. Grayson is our guest let me throw this
[2:08:14.600 --> 2:08:19.600]  question out at you homeland security has set in Texas both state and federal
[2:08:19.600 --> 2:08:25.600]  I've had a state senator and the state rep on and the last week on the subject
[2:08:25.600 --> 2:08:30.600]  quietly they say the National Guard is on one of its highest alerts preparing
[2:08:30.600 --> 2:08:33.600]  to even have to shut down the border they have to that they believe there is
[2:08:33.600 --> 2:08:38.600]  a chance they won't say on air they say that's classified but they say they
[2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:43.600]  know the percentage they claim but they say a good chance Mexico may
[2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:48.600]  completely collapse from me from deeply studying this professor do you think
[2:08:48.600 --> 2:08:54.600]  that's accurate no Mexico is not going to collapse and a major reason is that
[2:08:54.600 --> 2:09:00.600]  the Mexican military is by strong by far the strongest force in the country
[2:09:00.600 --> 2:09:07.600]  and it's completely loyal to president Felipe Calderon but you are going to
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:16.600]  see areas where people flee the country and seodot waters is a case in point as
[2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:25.600]  is Nogales Tijuana most of the border cities the twin cities are under a
[2:09:25.600 --> 2:09:30.600]  great deal of pressure now Alex we can look on the bright side because the
[2:09:30.600 --> 2:09:36.600]  Mexican economy is suffering even worse than ours but there's one industry
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:42.600]  that's thriving along the border and that's the funeral industry and the
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:49.600]  the current crop of morticians can't take care of all the bodies and so funeral
[2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:54.600]  directors from other parts of the country are opening up branches and in order to
[2:09:54.600 --> 2:10:00.600]  get a piece of the market they have specials going for example if your
[2:10:00.600 --> 2:10:07.600]  loved one is decapitated and you've got the body but you can't find the head
[2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:14.600]  these newcomers will put the body on ice until you can find the head and not
[2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:20.600]  charge you extra and will do a great cosmetic job of making your loved one
[2:10:20.600 --> 2:10:27.600]  look as if he were still with you so there is good news Alex wow boy then
[2:10:27.600 --> 2:10:32.600]  don't tell me the bad news I see different numbers in the press coming to
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:37.600]  press as there's 14 illegal 14 million illegal aliens next they say there's
[2:10:37.600 --> 2:10:42.600]  30 million in the US I see numbers of 6,000 8,000 10,000 Mexicans that died
[2:10:42.600 --> 2:10:47.600]  last year in violence and thousands already this year what's from your
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:52.600]  research what's the closest number to how many people really died last year
[2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:56.600]  well we have pretty good numbers on that and while we're talking I'll pull up
[2:10:56.600 --> 2:11:04.600]  the exact number but it's just over 6,000 and I think both the
[2:11:04.600 --> 2:11:11.600]  newspapers that are credible and also the authorities agree on that number
[2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:17.600]  it looks like it's going to be larger this year given the rapid start in
[2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:25.600]  executions we've had during the months of January and February as far as
[2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:34.600]  the illegal immigrants go it's anybody's guess I would say 12 14,000 is
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:42.600]  probably a low figure and we're going to see more pressure on the border even
[2:11:42.600 --> 2:11:49.600]  though there's they're not jobs in the US what we can appreciate is if you've
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:55.600]  got the choice of living in a country where there are no jobs but the
[2:11:55.600 --> 2:12:00.600]  rule of law has broken down or trying to get into a country where there are
[2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:07.600]  no jobs but we still have the rule of law it you really don't have to be a
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:13.600]  rocket scientist to to make that choice and therefore there's continuing
[2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:20.600]  pressure on people trying to get into the into the United States by the way
[2:12:20.600 --> 2:12:26.600]  I've just pulled up a number here which I think is accurate 5,207
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:36.600]  executions in 2008 5,207 and so far this year in the first two months
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:44.600]  there's been a thousand 34 Wow so a massive increase what is that like a
[2:12:44.600 --> 2:12:52.600]  well if we multiply that by 6 it's going to certainly be a thousand or so more
[2:12:52.600 --> 2:13:02.600]  this year but we've got elections in Mexico on on the 5th of July and I
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:07.600]  suspect that the political authorities are going to try to dampen down the
[2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:14.600]  violence surrounding those around that election period okay I have a I have a
[2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:18.600]  million questions for you sir sure but I'm rambling oh no you're not rambling
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:23.600]  believe me this is all so important I'm an excuse me for interrupting and I
[2:13:23.600 --> 2:13:26.600]  want you to finish the point I just interrupted what I mean you've really
[2:13:26.600 --> 2:13:30.600]  studied Mexico when we were searching out the academics and you're one of the
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:34.600]  top academics from what we've researched you know really understanding the
[2:13:34.600 --> 2:13:41.600]  culture down there a why does this culture allow corruption and the basic
[2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:46.600]  fact that Mordito or kickbacks or or beak dipping was allowed by the central
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:52.600]  government for so long and the fact that corruption was seen as okay is that
[2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:57.600]  how it's now just grown and blossomed and gotten so much worse or are there
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:04.600]  factors that are causing things to get much worse well the ubiquitous poverty
[2:14:04.600 --> 2:14:12.600]  is a is a factor the amount of red tape it takes about 55 days to open even a
[2:14:12.600 --> 2:14:19.600]  small convenience store in Mexico City and that's 55 pieces of paper that
[2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:25.600]  need at least 55 signatures and you can see the opportunity for abuse there it
[2:14:25.600 --> 2:14:31.600]  goes back to the to the colonial period when the viceroys would take the
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:36.600]  decrees from Madrid and they would put them over there roll them up and put
[2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:42.600]  them over their head and they would say oba desco pero no cumplo which means
[2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:48.600]  I obey but I'm not going to carry out the monarch's dictum because it would
[2:14:48.600 --> 2:14:54.600]  embarrass him or her and so we've had a manipulative attitude toward law
[2:14:54.600 --> 2:15:00.600]  since the colonial period if not before and that's not going to change any
[2:15:00.600 --> 2:15:05.600]  time in our lifetimes who was more corrupt just a point of history the
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:10.600]  Spanish government or when they had the the Germanic government in there with
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:17.600]  Maximilian well Maximilian wasn't a bad guy he was really a reformer but it was
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:23.600]  such a blow to Mexican nationalism to have a hopsborg installed on the
[2:15:23.600 --> 2:15:29.600]  throne by Napoleon the third that he of course was executed along with his his
[2:15:29.600 --> 2:15:37.600]  wife Carlota but I think he probably ran a pretty tight ship but the forces
[2:15:37.600 --> 2:15:43.600]  were much greater than he okay expanding on the point we're bringing up earlier
[2:15:43.600 --> 2:15:48.600]  about the elections coming up and in the military attempting to dampen that down
[2:15:48.600 --> 2:15:55.600]  your words please continue well the the military is carrying the ball with
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:16:02.600]  regard to the so-called war on drugs which I think is an unfortunate metaphor
[2:16:02.600 --> 2:16:07.600]  because a war suggests that there's something you can win and there's not
[2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:13.600]  going to be any victory against the drug cartels you may be able to manage the
[2:16:13.600 --> 2:16:20.600]  violence more and manage the drug trade but it's not going to be extinguished
[2:16:20.600 --> 2:16:26.600]  but the military's role is not just in terms of their professional
[2:16:26.600 --> 2:16:33.600]  responsibilities but many retired generals are now becoming the secretaries
[2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:40.600]  of public security or police chiefs in states and in large cities and so we're
[2:16:40.600 --> 2:16:47.600]  seeing a militarization of law enforcement as well as the military playing
[2:16:47.600 --> 2:16:53.600]  its traditional role that doesn't mean there's going to be a coup d'etat or that
[2:16:53.600 --> 2:16:58.600]  the military is going to take over but the military is looked upon in Mexico
[2:16:58.600 --> 2:17:04.600]  much like Americans view public schools and you know as well as I if we can't
[2:17:04.600 --> 2:17:10.600]  solve a problem in society we turn it over to the public schools drugs alcohol
[2:17:10.600 --> 2:17:16.600]  teenage pregnancy you name it in Mexico any problem that can't be solved by the
[2:17:16.600 --> 2:17:21.600]  civilians they toss the ball to the military well that's what I've noticed
[2:17:21.600 --> 2:17:25.600]  I got out of Mexico a few times a year I won't be going back and there's just troops
[2:17:25.600 --> 2:17:29.600]  everywhere boarded up shops everywhere even in the south even in the you know
[2:17:29.600 --> 2:17:34.600]  supposedly nicer areas down in the Yucatan Peninsula I've got reports here
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:39.600]  about killings in Cancun out of the Los Angeles Times you know now the state
[2:17:39.600 --> 2:17:42.600]  department saying it's dangerous down there colleges as you know but for the
[2:17:42.600 --> 2:17:46.600]  audience are telling people watch out if you go down there how dangerous is it
[2:17:46.600 --> 2:17:51.600]  for the average American or Canadian to go down to Mexico right now
[2:17:51.600 --> 2:17:57.600]  most of the civilians who get caught up in the violence just happened to be at
[2:17:57.600 --> 2:18:03.600]  the wrong place at the wrong time there's no targeting of civilians there's
[2:18:03.600 --> 2:18:09.600]  certainly no targeting of foreigners so I wouldn't have any in fact I'm going to
[2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:16.600]  Mexico next week but I have no qualms about going to Mexico City I love cities
[2:18:16.600 --> 2:18:22.600]  like Kedetaro or Zacatecas if you get into the resort areas you're pretty
[2:18:22.600 --> 2:18:27.600]  well cocooned what about kidnapping though that is exploding isn't it
[2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:33.600]  yeah all kinds of kidnapping is exposed is exploding I mean there's there's the
[2:18:33.600 --> 2:18:39.600]  genuine kidnapping where somebody is grabbed off the street but also Alex
[2:18:39.600 --> 2:18:46.600]  you might be at your desk and you get a phone call and someone says I'm holding
[2:18:46.600 --> 2:18:56.600]  your 15 year old daughter who just left St. Ignatius prep school and if you
[2:18:56.600 --> 2:19:03.600]  want to see her back then a man's going to come by your office in 10 minutes and
[2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:08.600]  you better give him a thousand dollars well the person may not have your
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:14.600]  daughter but you try to reach her on the cell phone you can't she's not at home
[2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:22.600]  and so you're likely to pony up a thousand dollars because the the danger is
[2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:28.600]  so widespread that you can't take chances and then the guy shows up and
[2:19:28.600 --> 2:19:31.600]  gets the money but then your daughter shows up and really wasn't kidnapped
[2:19:31.600 --> 2:19:38.600]  that's right that's right see I would I can't imagine like do I pay or do I
[2:19:38.600 --> 2:19:43.600]  kill this person how do I control myself I just can't imagine being put in that
[2:19:43.600 --> 2:19:46.600]  position stay there sir we've got a break there's so many other questions I've
[2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:50.600]  got for you you know where you see this going is it going to get worse is it
[2:19:50.600 --> 2:19:54.600]  going to get better are there any solutions all these stories I see in the
[2:19:54.600 --> 2:20:01.600]  Texas press about Satanism on the border kidnapping killing people in rituals
[2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:05.600]  phase one of the insiders plan for a one world government has been initiated with
[2:20:05.600 --> 2:20:09.600]  the recent bailout international bankers and power brokers have engineered the
[2:20:09.600 --> 2:20:14.600]  crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as saviour but we've

[2:24:18.600 --> 2:24:24.600]  and thugs just Google that and pull it up or you can find it in bookstores
[2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:30.600]  everywhere we appreciate the professor joining us today
[2:24:30.600 --> 2:24:35.600]  professor you already said it's getting worse there they're on track to have
[2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:40.600]  murders than last year we're now seeing murders spill over to the US I know in
[2:24:40.600 --> 2:24:45.600]  California and Arizona to Mexico a lot of city officials police chiefs mayors
[2:24:45.600 --> 2:24:50.600]  fire chiefs live on the US side now places that were you know hopping
[2:24:50.600 --> 2:24:56.600]  tourists traps are now dead if it's getting worse how much worse will it
[2:24:56.600 --> 2:25:00.600]  get I mean are you projecting it just gets worse and worse each year out until
[2:25:00.600 --> 2:25:08.600]  it's happening you know it's going to continue to deteriorate as long as we
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:16.600]  are buying 80 85 percent of the drugs that are produced in or passed through
[2:25:16.600 --> 2:25:24.600]  Mexico and while it's a political third rail for politicians I think we're
[2:25:24.600 --> 2:25:30.600]  going to have to move toward decriminalizing the possession and the sale
[2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:35.600]  of small quantities of at least marijuana to begin with and that'll drive down
[2:25:35.600 --> 2:25:39.600]  the price and it'll I mean look what happened I'm glad you said this because
[2:25:39.600 --> 2:25:42.600]  I had a state senator on as a big Republican and he was even having to
[2:25:42.600 --> 2:25:46.600]  admit that Mexico is having to look at this because if there weren't fantastic
[2:25:46.600 --> 2:25:53.600]  profits you wouldn't have all of this going on sure and prohibition is just
[2:25:53.600 --> 2:26:00.600]  an example of where we tried to outlaw something and the result was that the
[2:26:00.600 --> 2:26:08.600]  crime spiraled illegal activity mushroomed and the consumption of alcohol
[2:26:08.600 --> 2:26:19.600]  rose and so I'm afraid because there's no good answer but we have to at
[2:26:19.600 --> 2:26:24.600]  least think about the unthinkable and I hope that more politicians will step
[2:26:24.600 --> 2:26:30.600]  forward and at least raise the issue for debate well I bought a little piece of
[2:26:30.600 --> 2:26:35.600]  property in the Austin Hill country like four acres and we found on that the
[2:26:35.600 --> 2:26:39.600]  laudanum bottles from you know 80 90 years ago I mean every drugstore had
[2:26:39.600 --> 2:26:44.600]  cocaine opium everything you know any old farmhouse you find out you know in
[2:26:44.600 --> 2:26:48.600]  the bushes these bottles or you dig and you find them a lot of Americans use
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:51.600]  it but I've seen the numbers it was around a third of the people that are on
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:57.600]  opiates you know then it was a third of the amount of people that we have now
[2:26:57.600 --> 2:27:03.600]  when these opiates are highly controlled yeah well Coca-Cola originally had
[2:27:03.600 --> 2:27:09.600]  coke coke in it that's right and it was it was eventually taken out because of
[2:27:09.600 --> 2:27:13.600]  the political issues but yes it was widespread around the turn of the
[2:27:13.600 --> 2:27:19.600]  century and that was all lumped in with the prohibition with the prohibition
[2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:24.600]  movement okay so by getting worse what is Mexico going to look like in 6 months 12
[2:27:24.600 --> 2:27:29.600]  months a year and a half we're gonna we're gonna see it in terms of more
[2:27:29.600 --> 2:27:36.600]  pressure at the border and I think we need to move ahead and get that fence
[2:27:36.600 --> 2:27:44.600]  completed that's no panacea because probably Alex 40% of the illegal
[2:27:44.600 --> 2:27:50.600]  immigrants who come into the United States come in legally as students or as
[2:27:50.600 --> 2:27:58.600]  business people or as tourists simply overstay their visas and I think if you
[2:27:58.600 --> 2:28:04.600]  were I didn't pay our visa card in a month or two visa would find us but the
[2:28:04.600 --> 2:28:11.600]  Department of Homeland Security has no records and so let's hope that Governor
[2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:19.600]  Napolitano will try to close that loophole because we are an open society
[2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:27.600]  we want to stay that way but it is intolerable that a third to 40% of legal
[2:28:27.600 --> 2:28:36.600]  visitors can overstay their term and become illegal aliens I don't I'm not
[2:28:36.600 --> 2:28:44.600]  politically correct I don't use the term undocumented immigrant that to me is
[2:28:44.600 --> 2:28:52.600]  like saying that a bank robber is an unauthorized withdrawal specialist you're
[2:28:52.600 --> 2:28:57.600]  funny oh I tell you there's so much to talk about we've got one minute before
[2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:00.600]  we break we're coming along segment with you final segment what are some of the
[2:29:00.600 --> 2:29:04.600]  I mean I've asked my question sir you're the expert on this what are some of the
[2:29:04.600 --> 2:29:11.600]  key points that are coming up in the next segment we have the government our
[2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:17.600]  government cannot patronize the Mexicans Mexico is an incredibly wealthy
[2:29:17.600 --> 2:29:26.600]  country oil gas gold silver beaches historical artifacts and we have got to
[2:29:26.600 --> 2:29:32.600]  encourage the Mexicans to mobilize their resources and provide a better life
[2:29:32.600 --> 2:29:37.600]  for their people let's talk about your ideas from studying the culture and
[2:29:37.600 --> 2:29:40.600]  writing a weekly publication on the subject of how they can do that because
[2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:44.600]  the corrupt want to keep everything to themselves and so the people really
[2:29:44.600 --> 2:29:49.600]  never get a chance to get out of poverty how do we change the kleptocracy that

[2:33:15.600 --> 2:33:24.600]  we are back live and professor george grason author of the new book mexico's struggle with drugs and thugs
[2:33:24.600 --> 2:33:27.600]  excellent book folks will understand what's happening down in mexico
[2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:36.600]  we've got to decriminalize drugs now ladies and gentlemen because it creates a giant criminal society crime went up several hundred percentage points
[2:33:36.600 --> 2:33:40.600]  across the united states during the nine years of prohibition
[2:33:40.600 --> 2:33:46.600]  alcoholism spiked poisoning from alcohol spiked that that's why heroin and cocaine is filled with other poisons
[2:33:46.600 --> 2:33:52.600]  all of it it is it and then there's all this money involved in it so it's it's it's seen as stylish and cool and
[2:33:52.600 --> 2:33:56.600]  cutting-edge and you know fancy cars and mansions so people get into it
[2:33:56.600 --> 2:34:03.600]  but if we decriminalize the only problem is the major banks that have been laundering this money forever going to collapse
[2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:10.600]  professor you know growing up in texas i've read all the texas monthly and also many news articles about women being kidnapped
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:18.600]  from el paso and laredo other places being taken over being killed being raped all the women they've dug up dead in the desert
[2:34:18.600 --> 2:34:27.600]  and you know hundreds and hundreds just in one case in el paso what's your intel on that what's happening there
[2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:39.600]  is a they're targeting women in waters and of course it's easy to pass from war as in del paso to pick up your your victims
[2:34:39.600 --> 2:34:50.600]  the mexican authorities claim to be pursuing all leads but they've been monumentally unsuccessful in finding the culprits
[2:34:50.600 --> 2:35:00.600]  and it doesn't appear to be linked to the narco violence but uh... a separate group of uh... of ghoulish killers
[2:35:00.600 --> 2:35:10.600]  but uh... i frankly don't know uh... changing subjects briefly we were talking about what mexican can but what mexico can do
[2:35:10.600 --> 2:35:20.600]  yes no yeah and and the the barack obama administration has no silver bullets i hope they don't exacerbate the situation by trying to uh...
[2:35:20.600 --> 2:35:30.600]  to uh... let more illegal workers in the united states or legalizing those who are here uh... however take one example the teachers
[2:35:30.600 --> 2:35:40.600]  uh... uh... in mexico belong to uh... one of the most uh... venal and corrupt and wealthy unions in the world
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:50.600]  and the way you get your teaching job is by playing dice with the union and uh... this means that the middle class
[2:35:50.600 --> 2:36:00.600]  uh... families they will literally uh... sell a kidney in order to get their kids into private schools uh... a country can't progress
[2:36:00.600 --> 2:36:10.600]  if it doesn't have first rate health care and good education and mexico has neither uh... but the calderon government is really uh...
[2:36:10.600 --> 2:36:20.600]  for political reasons working with the head of the teachers union uh... my stride she's called uh... when they should be doing
[2:36:20.600 --> 2:36:32.600]  trust busting not just of the big corporations in mexico but of powerful labor unions that have colonized public education
[2:36:32.600 --> 2:36:42.600]  colonized the petroleum sector they've uh... uh... colonized the electricity industry and that's something the mexicans on their own can do
[2:36:42.600 --> 2:36:52.600]  the second thing is they don't pay taxes in mexico uh... mexico collects as a percentage of gross domestic product about eleven point eight percent
[2:36:52.600 --> 2:37:04.600]  uh... of its a gdp that's on a par with heady and absolutely failed state it's a third of what we collect and we collect too much
[2:37:04.600 --> 2:37:12.600]  but uh... they've got to start raising revenues so that's the official that's the official taxes though people pay all this more dito
[2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:20.600]  to police corrupt officials the corrupt unions the the uh... thugs and you have any idea of what the real number of taxes through payoffs uh...
[2:37:20.600 --> 2:37:32.600]  i think the official taxes are just the tip of the uh... of the iceberg uh... because for example if you want a career job a tenured job
[2:37:32.600 --> 2:37:42.600]  in the uh... public oil monopoly you would pay about forty thousand dollars uh... for a professional position there and that would ensure
[2:37:42.600 --> 2:37:52.600]  you uh... a good income for the rest of your life and a princely retirement well let me tell you a story i uh... about three years ago
[2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:59.600]  took a five day vacation with my family i wanted to go see you know show my wife the pyramids down there we went down the coast of my
[2:37:59.600 --> 2:38:07.600]  i went to some of the pyramids and they would stop the big tour bus with uh... you know humvees and jeeps with machine guns in the back
[2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:15.600]  and heavy machine guns and the bus driver would get out and go pay them cash just to drive the you know thirty miles to the pyramid
[2:38:15.600 --> 2:38:22.600]  and i hadn't seen that previously when i was in high school and college and you know going my parents down there so uh...
[2:38:22.600 --> 2:38:28.600]  i mean we talk about corruption it's right up at the top we always hear about top government officials being caught on the payroll of different
[2:38:28.600 --> 2:38:37.600]  mafias different cartels uh... something we talk about you know the government fighting cartels isn't this really the government that controls the
[2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:45.600]  the major cartels battling it out with non licensed uh... cartels about a lot of former d agents and others tell me that a lot of the
[2:38:45.600 --> 2:38:53.600]  drug war we see is bigger cartels for the government fighting with those that are actually cowboys you know i think that uh...
[2:38:53.600 --> 2:39:06.600]  philippe calderon whom i've known for some some years is is a decent uh... respectable well-intentioned per person who is pure as uh...
[2:39:06.600 --> 2:39:16.600]  as caesar's wife but there are certainly some bad actors around him and we talked about the elections coming up on july five
[2:39:16.600 --> 2:39:30.600]  it looks like the old uh... pre the party that ran mexico four oh nineteen twenty nine until uh... two thousand is going to return to power
[2:39:30.600 --> 2:39:39.600]  uh... first in taking over the congress and then in all likelihood uh... winning back the presidency in twenty twelve
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:49.600]  and the pre is the party that's most closely tied uh... to the criminal organizations so is this well i mean is what you're getting at
[2:39:49.600 --> 2:39:58.600]  uh... the the pre is orchestrating all of this to make it collapse so they get back in the power uh... i don't know whether it's that mackey of alien
[2:39:58.600 --> 2:40:10.600]  but the pre was in power so long that many of their leaders developed uh... working relations shall we say uh... with the drug barons
[2:40:10.600 --> 2:40:18.600]  and i haven't seen any attempt to buy the pre to uh... separate themselves from the bad guys
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:32.600]  uh... and alex i want to say i'm an optimist by nature when i get an email from an ex uh... secretary of uh... finance from
[2:40:32.600 --> 2:40:42.600]  nigeria telling me that if i will send him couple of dollars he will send me ten million dollars i always write him a check i feel he's just like
[2:40:42.600 --> 2:40:52.600]  he's just down his luck uh... hard to be optimistic when you look at mexico so in the long run what do you see happening in mexico
[2:40:52.600 --> 2:41:07.600]  uh... that uh... conditions uh... continue to deteriorate uh... unemployment grows and there is uh... a massive crush to leave the country
[2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:15.600]  some will go to europe some to canada some to australia but the overwhelming majority will try to get into the united states
[2:41:15.600 --> 2:41:23.600]  and that's going to mean that we don't just put uh... walls at the at the border but we're going to have to have national guard
[2:41:23.600 --> 2:41:30.600]  if not regular troops there mexico poses a much greater threat to us than say pakistan or afghanistan
[2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:40.600]  clearly passed administrations since bill clinton you know george bush and now obama admittedly are allowing mexico to use the united states
[2:41:40.600 --> 2:41:48.600]  as a steam valve uh... you know way over thirty million illegal aliens that come back and forth and upwards of forty percent i've seen in the news
[2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:56.600]  of the money they send back ends up being paid in secret taxes so that's you know the u.s. funding uh... this corruption as well
[2:41:56.600 --> 2:42:05.600]  and it looks like the establishment's gonna attempt with this contiguous uh... security prosperity partnership border from what i've seen in the sbp
[2:42:05.600 --> 2:42:11.600]  north american uh... union integration documents the judicial watch student got about two years ago
[2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:19.600]  what i see happening is that uh... they're talking about it is somehow the u.s. invading backing up the mexican military
[2:42:19.600 --> 2:42:28.600]  uh... there uh... somehow uh... then legalizing uh... tens of millions more workers i mean i don't see that working i
[2:42:28.600 --> 2:42:31.600]  and i think we need to shut that border down right now
[2:42:31.600 --> 2:42:37.600]  you know and pushback is coming as we know the politicians in washington
[2:42:37.600 --> 2:42:39.600]  living their own world
[2:42:39.600 --> 2:42:43.600]  uh... but where you find resistance to
[2:42:43.600 --> 2:42:46.600]  uh... the porosity of the border
[2:42:46.600 --> 2:42:49.600]  and state legislatures
[2:42:49.600 --> 2:42:53.600]  and uh... you see it in texas you see it in arizona
[2:42:53.600 --> 2:42:58.600]  you see it in arkansas you see it in tennessee you see it all
[2:42:58.600 --> 2:43:01.600]  uh... throughout the south and the southwest
[2:43:01.600 --> 2:43:05.600]  where hundreds of bills are being introduced
[2:43:05.600 --> 2:43:07.600]  to curtail the benefits
[2:43:07.600 --> 2:43:10.600]  uh... given to illegal immigrants
[2:43:10.600 --> 2:43:13.600]  and as our unemployment rate
[2:43:13.600 --> 2:43:16.600]  approaches ten percent in this country
[2:43:16.600 --> 2:43:21.600]  i think that some of the uh... candy ass liberals in washington
[2:43:21.600 --> 2:43:24.600]  are even going to excuse my language i love it going to
[2:43:24.600 --> 2:43:27.600]  are even going to rethink their positions
[2:43:27.600 --> 2:43:31.600]  because they are out of touch with their constituents
[2:43:31.600 --> 2:43:37.600]  and alex i have to tell you i'm a yellow dog democrat i'm i'm a roosevelt truman democrat
[2:43:37.600 --> 2:43:42.600]  but i can't uh... believe that we are short changing
[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:45.600]  civil residents of the united states
[2:43:45.600 --> 2:43:49.600]  who have serious problems who've lost their jobs
[2:43:49.600 --> 2:43:51.600]  who've lost their homes
[2:43:51.600 --> 2:43:55.600]  and are contemplating uh... opening the border to
[2:43:55.600 --> 2:44:00.600]  uh... those who have uh... are trying to enter illegally
[2:44:00.600 --> 2:44:03.600]  or giving citizenship to those who've broken the law
[2:44:03.600 --> 2:44:05.600]  to uh... get into this country
[2:44:05.600 --> 2:44:07.600]  well professor grason
[2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:10.600]  you're absolutely right i mean this is just reality
[2:44:10.600 --> 2:44:15.600]  on the planet uh... and uh... you study this professionally
[2:44:15.600 --> 2:44:19.600]  but i can't think of many other nations except for maybe some
[2:44:19.600 --> 2:44:23.600]  central african or west african eastern african
[2:44:23.600 --> 2:44:29.600]  nations that are as bad as mexico and on the verge of disintegration
[2:44:29.600 --> 2:44:33.600]  uh... as mexico is i mean it's one of the
[2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:37.600]  well it's so wealthy triple the natural resources we have
[2:44:37.600 --> 2:44:41.600]  are so corrupt and i can't think of having a more vile nasty
[2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:43.600]  uh... neighbor
[2:44:43.600 --> 2:44:47.600]  i mean could could the u.s. border a more corrupt out of control dangerous
[2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:51.600]  nation with a hundred million people set to what double in the next thirty years
[2:44:51.600 --> 2:44:54.600]  to two hundred million uh... people
[2:44:54.600 --> 2:44:59.600]  uh... who get free health care anchor babies every everything's going bankrupt
[2:44:59.600 --> 2:45:03.600]  here tent city sprouting up from michigan to california to florida
[2:45:03.600 --> 2:45:06.600]  and the government is just going forward with more benefits i mean what is going to
[2:45:06.600 --> 2:45:11.600]  what is going to happen both on our side and in mexico
[2:45:11.600 --> 2:45:15.600]  the uh... the population is going to probably stabilize in mexico to about a
[2:45:15.600 --> 2:45:19.600]  hundred and fifteen hundred eighteen million
[2:45:19.600 --> 2:45:22.600]  uh... because mexico like ours is an aging
[2:45:22.600 --> 2:45:25.600]  uh... is an aging society
[2:45:25.600 --> 2:45:26.600]  uh... on it
[2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:30.600]  uh... person to person basis there are no nicer people
[2:45:30.600 --> 2:45:33.600]  in the world i know that you know i mean i agree but the system is so i mean i've been
[2:45:33.600 --> 2:45:36.600]  shut down by mexican cops so
[2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:37.600]  go ahead
[2:45:37.600 --> 2:45:40.600]  yeah well i agree if i if if
[2:45:40.600 --> 2:45:41.600]  my car
[2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:44.600]  were to break down an isolated area
[2:45:44.600 --> 2:45:45.600]  the last
[2:45:45.600 --> 2:45:49.600]  uh... vehicle i would want to approach me would be a police car
[2:45:49.600 --> 2:45:53.600]  uh... because you know you're going to get ripped off six ways to uh...
[2:45:53.600 --> 2:45:54.600]  uh... to sundown
[2:45:54.600 --> 2:45:56.600]  uh... but uh...
[2:45:56.600 --> 2:45:58.600]  there's a growing mexican middle class
[2:45:58.600 --> 2:46:01.600]  a lot of the criticism that we make up
[2:46:01.600 --> 2:46:04.600]  the Mexican government is made in mexico
[2:46:04.600 --> 2:46:06.600]  uh... but uh...
[2:46:06.600 --> 2:46:11.600]  uh... i fear that with the pre likely to come back to power
[2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:15.600]  that uh... conditions are going to
[2:46:15.600 --> 2:46:17.600]  uh... deteriorate
[2:46:17.600 --> 2:46:19.600]  and there's going to be more
[2:46:19.600 --> 2:46:21.600]  collusion
[2:46:21.600 --> 2:46:24.600]  uh... between the uh... organized crime
[2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:26.600]  uh... that's in the private sector
[2:46:26.600 --> 2:46:31.600]  and the organized crime that's in the public sector in the form of politicians
[2:46:31.600 --> 2:46:34.600]  quantify mexico getting worse for the
[2:46:34.600 --> 2:46:38.600]  i mean for the foreseeable future minutes many experts are saying it's on the verge
[2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:44.600]  of collapsing well no more of a slow rotting what is it going to rot into
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:47.600]  there's going to be a growing unemployment
[2:46:47.600 --> 2:46:53.600]  uh... more than a million newcomers enter the labor market each year
[2:46:53.600 --> 2:46:57.600]  find jobs and and moreover mexico's lost
[2:46:57.600 --> 2:47:00.600]  hundreds of thousands of jobs because of the uh...
[2:47:00.600 --> 2:47:03.600]  economic crisis generated in the united states
[2:47:03.600 --> 2:47:06.600]  uh... the educational system is
[2:47:06.600 --> 2:47:09.600]  uh... one of the worst
[2:47:09.600 --> 2:47:11.600]  in the relatively developed world
[2:47:11.600 --> 2:47:15.600]  uh... the health care system is uh... spotty
[2:47:15.600 --> 2:47:17.600]  uh... to say the least
[2:47:17.600 --> 2:47:20.600]  and uh... there is a uh...
[2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:23.600]  just uh... pervasive pessimism
[2:47:23.600 --> 2:47:26.600]  which i've never encountered before
[2:47:26.600 --> 2:47:28.600]  uh... that is engulfing
[2:47:28.600 --> 2:47:31.600]  uh... middle-class uh... mexicans
[2:47:31.600 --> 2:47:37.600]  and i've had many of them say if i could find a job in norway if i could find a job
[2:47:37.600 --> 2:47:39.600]  in england or the u.s.
[2:47:39.600 --> 2:47:42.600]  and they're talking about legal work now
[2:47:42.600 --> 2:47:44.600]  i would take it in a heartbeat
[2:47:44.600 --> 2:47:46.600]  even if it meant
[2:47:46.600 --> 2:47:49.600]  uh... leaving my parents my grandparents and so forth
[2:47:49.600 --> 2:47:54.600]  and one of the wonderful things about mexico is that they are so family-oriented
[2:47:54.600 --> 2:47:57.600]  oh yeah great people i mean that uh... you know that's the paradox
[2:47:57.600 --> 2:48:02.600]  here or the oxymoron is their great hard-working smart
[2:48:02.600 --> 2:48:07.600]  uh... you know great ingenuity just some of the best artwork just amazing people
[2:48:07.600 --> 2:48:12.600]  but then the government's pure scum and filth i mean i i just
[2:48:12.600 --> 2:48:15.600]  uh... you know and and that's uh...
[2:48:15.600 --> 2:48:19.600]  uh... what we're finding now in places like uh...
[2:48:19.600 --> 2:48:21.600]  michoacan
[2:48:21.600 --> 2:48:24.600]  which is on the uh... pacific coast uh...
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:26.600]  has the country's largest port
[2:48:26.600 --> 2:48:32.600]  is that in rural areas the drug cartels are actually vetting
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:35.600]  uh... the candidates for public office
[2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:38.600]  and the cartels aren't so much concerned about
[2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:40.600]  mexican deputies or senators
[2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:43.600]  who will serve in mexico city
[2:48:43.600 --> 2:48:46.600]  uh... their focus is on
[2:48:46.600 --> 2:48:48.600]  mayors
[2:48:48.600 --> 2:48:53.600]  and uh... municipal officer that's smart they know the real power is in the local area
[2:48:53.600 --> 2:48:56.600]  i've also read and seen reports all over where they're stealing people's land
[2:48:56.600 --> 2:49:00.600]  that they're pushing some of the small middle class off too
[2:49:00.600 --> 2:49:03.600]  uh... they may be doing some of that
[2:49:03.600 --> 2:49:07.600]  uh... but mexico uh... several drug dealers have just been
[2:49:07.600 --> 2:49:09.600]  found to be beneficiaries
[2:49:09.600 --> 2:49:15.600]  of some uh... farm subsidy programs for my gosh that the mexican government uh...
[2:49:15.600 --> 2:49:17.600]  mexican government operates
[2:49:17.600 --> 2:49:21.600]  digressing the the acid baths uh... i'd read some about that
[2:49:21.600 --> 2:49:25.600]  uh... their torturing people in acid or getting rid of the bodies in acid
[2:49:25.600 --> 2:49:29.600]  all they have various ways uh...
[2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:33.600]  uh... for example in michoacan about a year and a half ago
[2:49:33.600 --> 2:49:36.600]  uh... they took uh... five
[2:49:36.600 --> 2:49:41.600]  girls who uh... apparently had been flirting with a cartel
[2:49:41.600 --> 2:49:43.600]  uh... members girlfriend
[2:49:43.600 --> 2:49:48.600]  and while they were alive they sawed their heads off
[2:49:48.600 --> 2:49:50.600]  uh... and uh...
[2:49:50.600 --> 2:49:54.600]  then the next night they went to the place where the girlfriend worked
[2:49:54.600 --> 2:49:58.600]  and uh... tossed the heads onto the dance floor
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:03.600]  just to sort of send a message that you don't mess with us
[2:50:03.600 --> 2:50:06.600]  and the beheadings are becoming
[2:50:06.600 --> 2:50:09.600]  are becoming uh... legion
[2:50:09.600 --> 2:50:12.600]  uh... you can't say uh... in a joking fashion
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:16.600]  uh... well let's not lose our head over this because it may have resonance
[2:50:16.600 --> 2:50:18.600]  uh... in mexico
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:23.600]  and they're finding absolutely despicable ways to torture people
[2:50:23.600 --> 2:50:26.600]  and they're going after some of these military officers
[2:50:26.600 --> 2:50:30.600]  who've taken up security functions in the cities
[2:50:30.600 --> 2:50:33.600]  uh... general was hired
[2:50:33.600 --> 2:50:36.600]  uh... about a week ago in cancun
[2:50:36.600 --> 2:50:39.600]  uh... they broke all of his arms and legs
[2:50:39.600 --> 2:50:42.600]  uh... before pumping a bunch of bullets into his head
[2:50:42.600 --> 2:50:47.600]  just to say that no one is exempt from our violence

[2:54:09.600 --> 2:54:12.600]  Professor George Grayson of William & Mary
[2:54:12.600 --> 2:54:17.600]  Professor, you know you go through all these killings
[2:54:17.600 --> 2:54:19.600]  the torture of the murder
[2:54:19.600 --> 2:54:23.600]  now Phoenix is the kidnapping capital of the United States
[2:54:23.600 --> 2:54:27.600]  from what you say it's just going to get worse and worse and worse
[2:54:27.600 --> 2:54:29.600]  and we have to fight with the federal government
[2:54:29.600 --> 2:54:32.600]  not to just totally I guess let all this murder and killing
[2:54:32.600 --> 2:54:34.600]  and car bombings and Dallas and rocket attacks
[2:54:34.600 --> 2:54:36.600]  on the Texas border I guess it's just
[2:54:36.600 --> 2:54:39.600]  and I've interviewed sheriffs where the Mexican troops
[2:54:39.600 --> 2:54:41.600]  come across the border when they get some of the drugs
[2:54:41.600 --> 2:54:44.600]  and a shipment and put guns to the sheriff's heads
[2:54:44.600 --> 2:54:47.600]  and you know then I have state reps on they go well
[2:54:47.600 --> 2:54:50.600]  I don't know if that's true when it's in the newspapers on the border
[2:54:50.600 --> 2:54:53.600]  just I mean you say it's just going to get worse
[2:54:53.600 --> 2:54:56.600]  I mean until what just total cult I mean what's going to happen
[2:54:58.600 --> 2:55:03.600]  I really think that the decriminalization has to be
[2:55:03.600 --> 2:55:06.600]  the longer term answer
[2:55:06.600 --> 2:55:10.600]  and earlier we talked about the parallels with prohibition
[2:55:10.600 --> 2:55:16.600]  and of course ending prohibition wasn't a silver bullet
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:20.600]  but it's certainly reduced dramatically
[2:55:20.600 --> 2:55:26.600]  the Al Capone type gun battles that went on over turf
[2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:31.600]  and I think we're going to have to open our eyes to that
[2:55:31.600 --> 2:55:34.600]  but at the same time we're going to continue to see
[2:55:34.600 --> 2:55:38.600]  problems springing from Mexico in terms of
[2:55:38.600 --> 2:55:41.600]  the lack of opportunities there
[2:55:41.600 --> 2:55:46.600]  driving unemployed Mexicans into the United States
[2:55:46.600 --> 2:55:50.600]  legally if they can but most likely illegally
[2:55:50.600 --> 2:55:54.600]  and I think we must stop patronizing Mexico
[2:55:54.600 --> 2:55:57.600]  stop patting them on the head
[2:55:57.600 --> 2:56:01.600]  and say our little brown friends what can we do to help you
[2:56:01.600 --> 2:56:07.600]  and emphasize that they do have incredible resources
[2:56:07.600 --> 2:56:13.600]  which if they mobilized they could greatly improve
[2:56:13.600 --> 2:56:15.600]  the conditions for their people
[2:56:15.600 --> 2:56:18.600]  but the culture of corruption how do they get around that
[2:56:18.600 --> 2:56:23.600]  well I've always said that if Mexico could lease
[2:56:23.600 --> 2:56:29.600]  its territory to say Taiwan or Singapore for 20 years
[2:56:29.600 --> 2:56:33.600]  we'd be talking about the colossus of the south
[2:56:33.600 --> 2:56:37.600]  and we'd all be buying a pole vaulting equipment
[2:56:37.600 --> 2:56:40.600]  to jump the wall to get into Mexico
[2:56:40.600 --> 2:56:44.600]  because of the incredible resources they have
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:49.600]  but we play into the victimization line
[2:56:49.600 --> 2:56:53.600]  and I try to read the New York Times every morning
[2:56:53.600 --> 2:56:57.600]  sometimes I lose my breakfast because it still believes
[2:56:57.600 --> 2:57:01.600]  we should be legalizing illegals
[2:57:01.600 --> 2:57:06.600]  amid the high unemployment in the United States
[2:57:06.600 --> 2:57:10.600]  but I think it is going to depend on US policymakers
[2:57:10.600 --> 2:57:14.600]  talking turkey with their Mexican counterparts
[2:57:14.600 --> 2:57:20.600]  and saying we will cooperate as we're doing with the Merida initiative
[2:57:20.600 --> 2:57:27.600]  but the onus is really on you to improve your public school systems
[2:57:27.600 --> 2:57:34.600]  collect more in taxes to throw in jail those cops who are on the take
[2:57:34.600 --> 2:57:37.600]  but then they attack the jail
[2:57:37.600 --> 2:57:44.600]  yeah and regretfully often the inmates run the prisons
[2:57:44.600 --> 2:57:50.600]  and they've got the same problems with gangs inside the prisons
[2:57:50.600 --> 2:57:56.600]  one way you get around that is you lease the jails out to private industries
[2:57:56.600 --> 2:58:01.600]  and you pay professionals to run your jails
[2:58:01.600 --> 2:58:04.600]  well professor in closing I want to thank you for joining us
[2:58:04.600 --> 2:58:06.600]  but I get from everything you've said
[2:58:06.600 --> 2:58:09.600]  that it doesn't look like those proper things will be done
[2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:14.600]  and so Mexico I guess is just going to turn into the literal pit of hell
[2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:19.600]  well conditions are certainly not going to get better anytime soon
[2:58:19.600 --> 2:58:22.600]  alright the book is Mexico's struggle with drugs and thugs
[2:58:22.600 --> 2:58:24.600]  and bookstores everywhere
[2:58:24.600 --> 2:58:27.600]  any websites you like to fire out professor
[2:58:27.600 --> 2:58:32.600]  well the book is published by the Foreign Policy Association
[2:58:32.600 --> 2:58:35.600]  and so if anybody went to go to the Foreign Policy Association
[2:58:35.600 --> 2:58:37.600]  that's in New York
[2:58:37.600 --> 2:58:39.600]  alright thank you sir we're out of time
[2:58:39.600 --> 2:58:42.600]  thank you so much for the time
[2:58:42.600 --> 2:58:45.600]  thank you for listening to GCN
[2:58:45.600 --> 2:58:50.600]  be sure to visit GCNLive.com today
[2:58:50.600 --> 2:58:52.600]  hello friends this is Alex Jones
[2:58:52.600 --> 2:58:55.600]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[2:58:55.600 --> 2:58:57.600]  and today that's more important than ever
[2:58:57.600 --> 2:58:58.600]  we need to be independent
[2:58:58.600 --> 2:59:00.600]  and food and water is the key
[2:59:00.600 --> 2:59:02.600]  you'll never have to stand in a bread line
[2:59:02.600 --> 2:59:03.600]  for you have your own bread
[2:59:03.600 --> 2:59:05.600]  you'll never have to go to the Superdome
[2:59:05.600 --> 2:59:07.600]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[2:59:07.600 --> 2:59:09.600]  in any emergency if you simply prepare
[2:59:09.600 --> 2:59:11.600]  no one is going to take care of your family
[2:59:11.600 --> 2:59:12.600]  in the final equation that you
[2:59:12.600 --> 2:59:15.600]  you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food
[2:59:15.600 --> 2:59:18.600]  that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella genetic alteration
[2:59:18.600 --> 2:59:19.600]  or Chinese imports
[2:59:19.600 --> 2:59:22.600]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices
[2:59:22.600 --> 2:59:25.600]  call 1-800-409-5633
[2:59:25.600 --> 2:59:27.600]  or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com

[2:59:46.600 --> 2:59:49.600]  the first step is getting storable food
[3:00:16.600 --> 3:00:18.600]  I'm going to use the satellite coordinates
[3:00:18.600 --> 3:00:19.600]  for the new satellite
[3:00:19.600 --> 3:00:21.600]  I'm going to have a satellite on ABC Star Guide
[3:00:21.600 --> 3:00:22.600]  24 hours a day
[3:00:22.600 --> 3:00:24.600]  21 hours a day of this show
[3:00:24.600 --> 3:00:26.600]  well it's live and then retransmit it for stations
[3:00:26.600 --> 3:00:29.600]  and 3 hours a night with Jason Burmus
[3:00:29.600 --> 3:00:34.600]  that will be 9 to midnight this evening
[3:00:34.600 --> 3:00:36.600]  sent trial, standard time
[3:00:36.600 --> 3:00:37.600]  Burmus will be in studio
[3:00:37.600 --> 3:00:40.600]  this will be stacked in 30 minutes
[3:00:40.600 --> 3:00:42.600]  Gordon Brown admitting there's a world government
[3:00:42.600 --> 3:00:43.600]  world banking system
[3:00:43.600 --> 3:00:45.600]  they'll have a new world government banking system
[3:00:45.600 --> 3:00:46.600]  they'll have a new government
[3:00:46.600 --> 3:00:47.600]  and he's on his way to the United States
[3:00:47.600 --> 3:00:49.600]  to pitch this to the public
[3:00:49.600 --> 3:00:51.600]  so we will continue to break that down
[3:00:51.600 --> 3:00:54.600]  and cover it today
[3:00:54.600 --> 3:00:56.600]  right now you've been holding a while
[3:00:56.600 --> 3:00:58.600]  let's take your phone calls
[3:00:58.600 --> 3:01:01.600]  let's talk to Don in Alabama
[3:01:01.600 --> 3:01:02.600]  in Bama
[3:01:02.600 --> 3:01:04.600]  you're on the air Don
[3:01:04.600 --> 3:01:05.600]  how you doing Alex
[3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:06.600]  good sir
[3:01:06.600 --> 3:01:10.600]  I would like to talk about people's political affiliations today
[3:01:10.600 --> 3:01:14.600]  you know I've spoken up about Bush and his policies previously
[3:01:14.600 --> 3:01:17.600]  and over the years you know we've all gotten used to it
[3:01:17.600 --> 3:01:20.600]  but lately I've gotten a lot of feedback from people
[3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:22.600]  it seems like Republicans now
[3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:27.600]  are seeing that they have a chance to throw rocks at a Democratic president
[3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:29.600]  but my point to them is that
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:32.600]  it isn't about political affiliation
[3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:34.600]  it's something that is universal
[3:01:34.600 --> 3:01:36.600]  it isn't that I'm a Democrat
[3:01:36.600 --> 3:01:40.600]  I'm just trying to point out facts of things that are going on
[3:01:40.600 --> 3:01:43.600]  it's about policies and what the policies are
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:45.600]  of the gang of Crooks in Washington
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:49.600]  it doesn't really have no regard to whether you're a Democrat or a Republican
[3:01:49.600 --> 3:01:52.600]  you know I sat there and I told them early on
[3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:54.600]  as soon as I saw Brzezinski's name
[3:01:54.600 --> 3:01:56.600]  I knew Obama would win the election
[3:01:56.600 --> 3:01:57.600]  it was just a hands down thing
[3:01:57.600 --> 3:01:59.600]  people shake their head at me and oh you're an idiot
[3:01:59.600 --> 3:02:01.600]  you know but it came true
[3:02:01.600 --> 3:02:02.600]  of course it was
[3:02:02.600 --> 3:02:03.600]  I've seen the name before
[3:02:03.600 --> 3:02:06.600]  I know what's gonna happen
[3:02:06.600 --> 3:02:08.600]  but I try to give people to
[3:02:08.600 --> 3:02:10.600]  if you want to
[3:02:10.600 --> 3:02:13.600]  sit there and talk about what's going on
[3:02:13.600 --> 3:02:14.600]  stand with me
[3:02:14.600 --> 3:02:16.600]  don't try to stand across from me
[3:02:16.600 --> 3:02:19.600]  like you're opposing me as a Republican
[3:02:19.600 --> 3:02:22.600]  it's mindless party partisanship
[3:02:22.600 --> 3:02:24.600]  where the Republicans will attack Obama now
[3:02:24.600 --> 3:02:26.600]  for carrying out the same policies of Bush
[3:02:26.600 --> 3:02:27.600]  the Democrats will support Obama
[3:02:27.600 --> 3:02:29.600]  when he's carrying out the same policies of Bush
[3:02:29.600 --> 3:02:33.600]  it is utter madness and childlike simplicity
[3:02:33.600 --> 3:02:35.600]  for people not to be able to see through
[3:02:35.600 --> 3:02:37.600]  the fact that both parties are bought and paid for
[3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:39.600]  by the same interest
[3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:41.600]  you know I can go back and point to them
[3:02:41.600 --> 3:02:44.600]  and say well you're part of the Democratic Republican Party
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:45.600]  because that's where it all started
[3:02:45.600 --> 3:02:47.600]  and they split apart and went their own way
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:49.600]  the Republicans, the Republicans, yeah
[3:02:49.600 --> 3:02:52.600]  it's all the same thing from way back in the 1800s
[3:02:52.600 --> 3:02:54.600]  they just split and went their different way
[3:02:54.600 --> 3:02:56.600]  they're both paid off groups
[3:02:56.600 --> 3:02:59.600]  but I just like to encourage Republicans
[3:02:59.600 --> 3:03:00.600]  who want to call themselves that
[3:03:00.600 --> 3:03:02.600]  and Democrats who want to call themselves that
[3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:04.600]  to stand together
[3:03:04.600 --> 3:03:06.600]  and not try to belittle each other
[3:03:06.600 --> 3:03:08.600]  and belittle each other's efforts
[3:03:08.600 --> 3:03:10.600]  oh I agree, I appreciate your call Don
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:13.600]  there was this big Republican
[3:03:13.600 --> 3:03:15.600]  CPAC or whatever meeting
[3:03:15.600 --> 3:03:17.600]  Friday, Saturday
[3:03:17.600 --> 3:03:19.600]  and Ron Paul spoke at it and was anti-war
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:20.600]  and got cheered
[3:03:20.600 --> 3:03:22.600]  well he was anti-New World Order and got cheered
[3:03:22.600 --> 3:03:24.600]  but then Limbaugh and all the rest of them went up there
[3:03:24.600 --> 3:03:26.600]  and acted like this whole corrupt system
[3:03:26.600 --> 3:03:28.600]  was just set up overnight by Obama
[3:03:28.600 --> 3:03:30.600]  and acted like they're the good conservatives
[3:03:30.600 --> 3:03:33.600]  and they had a straw poll and Mitt Romney's their man
[3:03:33.600 --> 3:03:35.600]  that guy's about as conservative as
[3:03:35.600 --> 3:03:39.600]  Mao Zedong again
[3:03:39.600 --> 3:03:41.600]  then they on four to eight years
[3:03:41.600 --> 3:03:42.600]  they'll put a Republican in
[3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:44.600]  suddenly Republicans will love everything Obama was doing
[3:03:44.600 --> 3:03:46.600]  because a Republican will be doing it
[3:03:46.600 --> 3:03:48.600]  it is a mindless joke
[3:03:48.600 --> 3:03:50.600]  let's go ahead and talk to Tee in Canada
[3:03:50.600 --> 3:03:52.600]  Tee, go ahead
[3:03:52.600 --> 3:03:54.600]  hello
[3:03:54.600 --> 3:03:55.600]  hello Tee
[3:03:55.600 --> 3:03:56.600]  yes, how are you?
[3:03:56.600 --> 3:03:58.600]  actually my name is Duhok Geh
[3:03:58.600 --> 3:04:00.600]  but your guy couldn't pronounce it but Tee's good
[3:04:00.600 --> 3:04:02.600]  I wanted to know if you've seen this film
[3:04:02.600 --> 3:04:04.600]  by John Harris on YouTube
[3:04:04.600 --> 3:04:06.600]  called It's an Illusion
[3:04:06.600 --> 3:04:08.600]  I think it's very important
[3:04:08.600 --> 3:04:10.600]  I don't think so
[3:04:10.600 --> 3:04:12.600]  well you know I'm a skater guy
[3:04:12.600 --> 3:04:14.600]  on YouTube to search this John Harris
[3:04:14.600 --> 3:04:15.600]  it's an illusion
[3:04:15.600 --> 3:04:18.600]  he shows how the whole New World Order works

[3:07:08.600 --> 3:07:09.600]  while taking hot showers
[3:07:09.600 --> 3:07:10.600]  than when drinking the water
[3:07:10.600 --> 3:07:12.600]  that's because many chemicals are inhaled
[3:07:12.600 --> 3:07:13.600]  when they evaporate

[3:09:02.600 --> 3:09:04.600]  since May 2008
[3:09:04.600 --> 3:09:05.600]  I think you got a great show
[3:09:05.600 --> 3:09:06.600]  good message
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:08.600]  and you know it's real difficult
[3:09:08.600 --> 3:09:10.600]  waking people up to what you're talking about
[3:09:10.600 --> 3:09:12.600]  I was talking to people that I work with
[3:09:12.600 --> 3:09:14.600]  and they just kind of accept
[3:09:14.600 --> 3:09:16.600]  being slaves and it's ridiculous
[3:09:16.600 --> 3:09:18.600]  I'm African-American so it's really a repulsive
[3:09:18.600 --> 3:09:20.600]  but that's a whole different subject
[3:09:20.600 --> 3:09:22.600]  I called because I told the guy that
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:23.600]  answered your phone
[3:09:23.600 --> 3:09:25.600]  that I was actually in the masjid
[3:09:25.600 --> 3:09:27.600]  or the mosque as you guys call it
[3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:28.600]  in Toledo
[3:09:28.600 --> 3:09:30.600]  where they sent the FBI agent
[3:09:30.600 --> 3:09:31.600]  to infiltrate
[3:09:31.600 --> 3:09:34.600]  and basically make a case against people
[3:09:34.600 --> 3:09:36.600]  the point you made is that they choose
[3:09:36.600 --> 3:09:37.600]  the crazy people
[3:09:37.600 --> 3:09:39.600]  that they try to prop them up
[3:09:39.600 --> 3:09:40.600]  and make them into you know
[3:09:40.600 --> 3:09:42.600]  some kind of a criminal
[3:09:42.600 --> 3:09:43.600]  yeah for those that don't know
[3:09:43.600 --> 3:09:45.600]  let me stop you then I'll give you the floor
[3:09:45.600 --> 3:09:48.600]  I talked to an hour and a half ago
[3:09:48.600 --> 3:09:50.600]  about how we've had feds
[3:09:50.600 --> 3:09:52.600]  over and over again just show up at our events
[3:09:52.600 --> 3:09:54.600]  and say Alex let's go kill police
[3:09:54.600 --> 3:09:56.600]  and I'm like you're a big cop
[3:09:56.600 --> 3:09:58.600]  what is this you know we're nonviolent
[3:09:58.600 --> 3:09:59.600]  get out of here
[3:09:59.600 --> 3:10:01.600]  because when the police do that
[3:10:01.600 --> 3:10:03.600]  that's a crime
[3:10:03.600 --> 3:10:05.600]  it's not even entrapment
[3:10:05.600 --> 3:10:06.600]  it's provocaturing
[3:10:06.600 --> 3:10:09.600]  they are trying to get a crime committed
[3:10:09.600 --> 3:10:11.600]  where people get hurt and killed
[3:10:11.600 --> 3:10:12.600]  and in the case in Ohio
[3:10:12.600 --> 3:10:14.600]  it came out in the Associated Press during the trial
[3:10:14.600 --> 3:10:16.600]  that the guys weren't planning anything
[3:10:16.600 --> 3:10:18.600]  they weren't doing anything
[3:10:18.600 --> 3:10:20.600]  they were led by this FBI informant
[3:10:20.600 --> 3:10:21.600]  whose idea it was
[3:10:21.600 --> 3:10:23.600]  he just got them to shoot their mouths off
[3:10:23.600 --> 3:10:24.600]  yeah you know
[3:10:24.600 --> 3:10:26.600]  we ought to go ahead and do something
[3:10:26.600 --> 3:10:27.600]  and then it was all over the news
[3:10:27.600 --> 3:10:28.600]  a secret army of Muslims
[3:10:28.600 --> 3:10:29.600]  were going to kill everybody
[3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:31.600]  they were deadly strike forces
[3:10:31.600 --> 3:10:32.600]  of the most vicious
[3:10:32.600 --> 3:10:34.600]  they were planning to destroy all of America
[3:10:34.600 --> 3:10:35.600]  you know the black street kids
[3:10:35.600 --> 3:10:36.600]  who weren't even Muslim
[3:10:36.600 --> 3:10:37.600]  it was Muslims
[3:10:37.600 --> 3:10:39.600]  were planning an army attack
[3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:40.600]  on every major city
[3:10:40.600 --> 3:10:42.600]  and to destroy and total destruction
[3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:44.600]  it was a nationwide network
[3:10:44.600 --> 3:10:47.600]  of the most powerful savage controlled mechanisms
[3:10:47.600 --> 3:10:48.600]  ever seen
[3:10:48.600 --> 3:10:49.600]  they were trained
[3:10:49.600 --> 3:10:50.600]  they were ready
[3:10:50.600 --> 3:10:51.600]  oh my god
[3:10:51.600 --> 3:10:52.600]  and then six months later
[3:10:52.600 --> 3:10:53.600]  came out it was all staged
[3:10:53.600 --> 3:10:54.600]  none of it was true
[3:10:54.600 --> 3:10:55.600]  it was all made up
[3:10:55.600 --> 3:10:56.600]  and they take the guys
[3:10:56.600 --> 3:10:57.600]  that bombed the World Trade Center
[3:10:57.600 --> 3:10:58.600]  FBI cooked the bomb
[3:10:58.600 --> 3:10:59.600]  trained the drivers
[3:10:59.600 --> 3:11:00.600]  they were too dumb
[3:11:00.600 --> 3:11:01.600]  to even know where to park it
[3:11:01.600 --> 3:11:02.600]  thank god didn't blow up
[3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:03.600]  the main support column
[3:11:03.600 --> 3:11:04.600]  I mean over
[3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:05.600]  and creating clan groups
[3:11:05.600 --> 3:11:07.600]  and the Southern Poverty Law Center
[3:11:07.600 --> 3:11:08.600]  tied into Elohim City
[3:11:08.600 --> 3:11:09.600]  and the White supremacist compound
[3:11:09.600 --> 3:11:10.600]  Oklahoma City
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:11.600]  over and over and over again
[3:11:11.600 --> 3:11:12.600]  but go ahead now
[3:11:12.600 --> 3:11:13.600]  since I brought folks back up
[3:11:13.600 --> 3:11:14.600]  to speed when we were talking
[3:11:14.600 --> 3:11:15.600]  about an hour and a half ago
[3:11:15.600 --> 3:11:16.600]  and tell folks
[3:11:16.600 --> 3:11:17.600]  you know
[3:11:17.600 --> 3:11:18.600]  everything that you say
[3:11:18.600 --> 3:11:19.600]  rings so true to me
[3:11:19.600 --> 3:11:21.600]  because the FBI
[3:11:21.600 --> 3:11:23.600]  they investigated me
[3:11:23.600 --> 3:11:24.600]  they came to my mother's house
[3:11:24.600 --> 3:11:26.600]  they couldn't find where I live
[3:11:26.600 --> 3:11:28.600]  with my mother's house
[3:11:28.600 --> 3:11:29.600]  and me and my son-in-law
[3:11:29.600 --> 3:11:30.600]  come over to my mother
[3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:32.600]  my dad had cancer at the time
[3:11:32.600 --> 3:11:34.600]  I thought my dad died
[3:11:34.600 --> 3:11:35.600]  or something
[3:11:35.600 --> 3:11:36.600]  and my mom just like
[3:11:36.600 --> 3:11:37.600]  come over
[3:11:37.600 --> 3:11:38.600]  I want you to come over
[3:11:38.600 --> 3:11:39.600]  for a little while
[3:11:39.600 --> 3:11:40.600]  and I get over there
[3:11:40.600 --> 3:11:41.600]  and there's like
[3:11:41.600 --> 3:11:42.600]  four FBI guys
[3:11:42.600 --> 3:11:43.600]  in my house
[3:11:43.600 --> 3:11:44.600]  or Homeland Security
[3:11:44.600 --> 3:11:45.600]  in my mom's house
[3:11:45.600 --> 3:11:46.600]  they took my son-in-law
[3:11:46.600 --> 3:11:47.600]  in one room
[3:11:47.600 --> 3:11:48.600]  and grilled him
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:49.600]  they took me in another room
[3:11:49.600 --> 3:11:50.600]  and grilled me
[3:11:50.600 --> 3:11:51.600]  and you know
[3:11:51.600 --> 3:11:52.600]  the strange part about it is
[3:11:52.600 --> 3:11:53.600]  and you know
[3:11:53.600 --> 3:11:54.600]  agendas
[3:11:54.600 --> 3:11:55.600]  being what they are
[3:11:55.600 --> 3:11:56.600]  the mosque of that
[3:11:56.600 --> 3:11:57.600]  attended was mostly
[3:11:57.600 --> 3:11:58.600]  African-Americans
[3:11:58.600 --> 3:11:59.600]  and the three people
[3:11:59.600 --> 3:12:00.600]  that they pulled out of there
[3:12:00.600 --> 3:12:01.600]  were all Americans said
[3:12:01.600 --> 3:12:02.600]  I mean it was planned
[3:12:02.600 --> 3:12:03.600]  from the beginning
[3:12:03.600 --> 3:12:04.600]  the guy who was
[3:12:04.600 --> 3:12:05.600]  the FBI informant
[3:12:05.600 --> 3:12:06.600]  talked about
[3:12:06.600 --> 3:12:07.600]  he was fearing for his life
[3:12:07.600 --> 3:12:08.600]  after everything was said
[3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:09.600]  and done
[3:12:09.600 --> 3:12:10.600]  getting $50,000
[3:12:10.600 --> 3:12:11.600]  and $300,000
[3:12:11.600 --> 3:12:12.600]  whatever he got
[3:12:12.600 --> 3:12:13.600]  to come in
[3:12:13.600 --> 3:12:14.600]  and just you know
[3:12:14.600 --> 3:12:15.600]  make up a bunch of lies
[3:12:15.600 --> 3:12:16.600]  about people
[3:12:16.600 --> 3:12:18.600]  I mean it's repulsed
[3:12:18.600 --> 3:12:19.600]  well it came out in the news
[3:12:19.600 --> 3:12:20.600]  that he was leading it
[3:12:20.600 --> 3:12:21.600]  and commanding it
[3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:22.600]  yeah
[3:12:22.600 --> 3:12:23.600]  I mean there was
[3:12:23.600 --> 3:12:25.600]  I mean I could tell you
[3:12:25.600 --> 3:12:26.600]  I mean I wish I had more time
[3:12:26.600 --> 3:12:27.600]  to tell you
[3:12:27.600 --> 3:12:28.600]  I know you got a quick
[3:12:28.600 --> 3:12:29.600]  quick break coming up
[3:12:29.600 --> 3:12:30.600]  but
[3:12:30.600 --> 3:12:31.600]  no this is important
[3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:32.600]  tell folks what happened
[3:12:32.600 --> 3:12:33.600]  oh this guy
[3:12:33.600 --> 3:12:34.600]  and I'm going to use
[3:12:34.600 --> 3:12:35.600]  a stupid analogy
[3:12:35.600 --> 3:12:36.600]  okay
[3:12:36.600 --> 3:12:37.600]  you could say you like
[3:12:37.600 --> 3:12:38.600]  Russian ballet
[3:12:38.600 --> 3:12:39.600]  on the Wii
[3:12:39.600 --> 3:12:40.600]  on the Wii game system
[3:12:40.600 --> 3:12:41.600]  this guy would tell you
[3:12:41.600 --> 3:12:42.600]  oh I've got a collection of that
[3:12:42.600 --> 3:12:43.600]  and you know
[3:12:43.600 --> 3:12:44.600]  just come out
[3:12:44.600 --> 3:12:45.600]  whatever you want to do
[3:12:45.600 --> 3:12:46.600]  he wanted to do it with you
[3:12:46.600 --> 3:12:47.600]  all the time
[3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:48.600]  and it's just strange stuff
[3:12:48.600 --> 3:12:49.600]  I went to
[3:12:49.600 --> 3:12:50.600]  I went to the high school
[3:12:50.600 --> 3:12:51.600]  in Toledo
[3:12:51.600 --> 3:12:52.600]  and everybody
[3:12:52.600 --> 3:12:53.600]  in the high school
[3:12:53.600 --> 3:12:54.600]  I went to his two rival high
[3:12:54.600 --> 3:12:55.600]  schools
[3:12:55.600 --> 3:12:56.600]  he said he went to the other high
[3:12:56.600 --> 3:12:57.600]  school
[3:12:57.600 --> 3:12:58.600]  and just for steak
[3:12:58.600 --> 3:12:59.600]  and Scott and Matt Cumber
[3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:00.600]  he said he went to Matt
[3:13:00.600 --> 3:13:01.600]  Cumber
[3:13:01.600 --> 3:13:02.600]  everybody
[3:13:02.600 --> 3:13:03.600]  that I said I knew
[3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:04.600]  from there
[3:13:04.600 --> 3:13:05.600]  he didn't know
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:06.600]  a dog on person
[3:13:06.600 --> 3:13:07.600]  he swore up and down
[3:13:07.600 --> 3:13:08.600]  he was on the border
[3:13:08.600 --> 3:13:09.600]  between
[3:13:09.600 --> 3:13:10.600]  the border
[3:13:10.600 --> 3:13:11.600]  to attack Iraq
[3:13:11.600 --> 3:13:12.600]  he said he was special forces
[3:13:12.600 --> 3:13:13.600]  he was
[3:13:13.600 --> 3:13:14.600]  he had
[3:13:14.600 --> 3:13:15.600]  I had a
[3:13:15.600 --> 3:13:17.600]  Eastern Czechoslovakian gun
[3:13:17.600 --> 3:13:19.600]  he said he was in special forces
[3:13:19.600 --> 3:13:20.600]  that's at the height
[3:13:20.600 --> 3:13:21.600]  of the Cold War
[3:13:21.600 --> 3:13:22.600]  when he was supposedly
[3:13:22.600 --> 3:13:23.600]  being there
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:24.600]  he should know everything
[3:13:24.600 --> 3:13:25.600]  about this damn gun
[3:13:25.600 --> 3:13:26.600]  being in special forces
[3:13:26.600 --> 3:13:27.600]  he didn't even know
[3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:28.600]  what the damn gun was
[3:13:28.600 --> 3:13:29.600]  well let me ask you
[3:13:29.600 --> 3:13:30.600]  hold on sir
[3:13:30.600 --> 3:13:31.600]  specifically was he
[3:13:31.600 --> 3:13:32.600]  trying to get you to
[3:13:32.600 --> 3:13:33.600]  hey we ought to attack
[3:13:33.600 --> 3:13:34.600]  somebody
[3:13:34.600 --> 3:13:35.600]  no he would
[3:13:35.600 --> 3:13:36.600]  he would drop little hints
[3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:37.600]  because like
[3:13:37.600 --> 3:13:38.600]  you know the
[3:13:38.600 --> 3:13:39.600]  we spoke out against terrorism
[3:13:39.600 --> 3:13:40.600]  we spoke out against
[3:13:40.600 --> 3:13:41.600]  all that stuff
[3:13:41.600 --> 3:13:42.600]  so he was being careful
[3:13:42.600 --> 3:13:43.600]  but I mean
[3:13:43.600 --> 3:13:44.600]  the feds I've seen
[3:13:44.600 --> 3:13:45.600]  just
[3:13:45.600 --> 3:13:46.600]  openly sit down next to you
[3:13:46.600 --> 3:13:47.600]  and you're seated
[3:13:47.600 --> 3:13:48.600]  and rest and go
[3:13:48.600 --> 3:13:49.600]  let's attack the State Department
[3:13:49.600 --> 3:13:50.600]  and I'm like
[3:13:50.600 --> 3:13:51.600]  what are you talking about
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:52.600]  man I got a wife and kids
[3:13:52.600 --> 3:13:53.600]  I'm a radio host
[3:13:53.600 --> 3:13:54.600]  I'm not weird
[3:13:54.600 --> 3:13:56.600]  because I want to come cover
[3:13:56.600 --> 3:13:57.600]  world leaders
[3:13:57.600 --> 3:13:58.600]  setting up a world bank
[3:13:58.600 --> 3:13:59.600]  secretly in my country
[3:13:59.600 --> 3:14:00.600]  with Obama
[3:14:00.600 --> 3:14:01.600]  and Hillary in there secretly
[3:14:01.600 --> 3:14:02.600]  you're right
[3:14:02.600 --> 3:14:03.600]  go ahead
[3:14:03.600 --> 3:14:05.600]  they're a little bit more subtle
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:06.600]  I mean when you're
[3:14:06.600 --> 3:14:07.600]  when you're
[3:14:07.600 --> 3:14:08.600]  when
[3:14:08.600 --> 3:14:09.600]  I'll put it like this
[3:14:09.600 --> 3:14:10.600]  if I really want to
[3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:11.600]  infiltrate you
[3:14:11.600 --> 3:14:12.600]  I'm not going to come in
[3:14:12.600 --> 3:14:13.600]  and face up this counter
[3:14:13.600 --> 3:14:14.600]  to what you're trying to do
[3:14:14.600 --> 3:14:15.600]  I'm going to
[3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:16.600]  I'm going to know it better
[3:14:16.600 --> 3:14:17.600]  than you do
[3:14:17.600 --> 3:14:18.600]  and I'm going to come in
[3:14:18.600 --> 3:14:19.600]  and say some things
[3:14:19.600 --> 3:14:20.600]  that'll allow me to get in
[3:14:20.600 --> 3:14:21.600]  closer to what I
[3:14:21.600 --> 3:14:22.600]  consider to be the
[3:14:22.600 --> 3:14:23.600]  inner
[3:14:23.600 --> 3:14:24.600]  I understand no
[3:14:24.600 --> 3:14:25.600]  inner
[3:14:25.600 --> 3:14:26.600]  what would he say to you
[3:14:26.600 --> 3:14:27.600]  he'd be lying
[3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:28.600]  he just said
[3:14:28.600 --> 3:14:29.600]  you know
[3:14:29.600 --> 3:14:30.600]  I'm trying to learn
[3:14:30.600 --> 3:14:31.600]  Arabic
[3:14:31.600 --> 3:14:32.600]  he learned Arabic
[3:14:32.600 --> 3:14:33.600]  to a certain extent
[3:14:33.600 --> 3:14:34.600]  he was pretty proficient
[3:14:34.600 --> 3:14:35.600]  I mean he had
[3:14:35.600 --> 3:14:36.600]  he portrayed himself
[3:14:36.600 --> 3:14:37.600]  as the man
[3:14:37.600 --> 3:14:38.600]  and he used to
[3:14:38.600 --> 3:14:39.600]  you know
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:40.600]  teach Arabic and stuff
[3:14:40.600 --> 3:14:37.600]  he
[3:14:40.600 --> 3:14:41.600]  he
[3:14:41.600 --> 3:14:42.600]  he
[3:14:42.600 --> 3:14:43.600]  he
[3:14:43.600 --> 3:14:44.600]  he
[3:14:44.600 --> 3:14:45.600]  he
[3:14:45.600 --> 3:14:46.600]  he
[3:14:46.600 --> 3:14:47.600]  he
[3:14:47.600 --> 3:14:48.600]  he
[3:14:48.600 --> 3:14:49.600]  he
[3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:50.600]  he
[3:14:50.600 --> 3:14:51.600]  he
[3:14:51.600 --> 3:14:52.600]  he
[3:14:52.600 --> 3:14:53.600]  he
[3:14:53.600 --> 3:14:54.600]  he
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:14:55.600]  he
[3:14:55.600 --> 3:14:56.600]  he
[3:14:56.600 --> 3:14:57.600]  he
[3:14:57.600 --> 3:14:58.600]  he
[3:14:58.600 --> 3:14:59.600]  he
[3:14:59.600 --> 3:15:00.600]  he
[3:15:00.600 --> 3:15:01.600]  he
[3:15:01.600 --> 3:15:02.600]  he
[3:15:02.600 --> 3:15:03.600]  he
[3:15:03.600 --> 3:15:04.600]  he
[3:15:04.600 --> 3:15:05.600]  he
[3:15:05.600 --> 3:15:06.600]  but I were in the
[3:15:06.600 --> 3:15:11.920]  So the mosque is calling the feds saying we think this guy is a terrorist, do something
[3:15:11.920 --> 3:15:14.360]  and nothing happens to him
[3:15:14.360 --> 3:15:16.840]  Did he get the other guys to shoot their mouths off?
[3:15:16.840 --> 3:15:22.640]  Oh my God, if Alex, the three guys, okay, there's three of them that were supposed to
[3:15:22.640 --> 3:15:26.560]  be in it, the one guy I kind of knew because he used to sell clothes and stuff, I bought
[3:15:26.560 --> 3:15:27.560]  clothes
[3:15:27.560 --> 3:15:30.760]  Well, you know, they have stage deals where even the guys they bust are staged and none
[3:15:30.760 --> 3:15:34.080]  of it's real, that's come out where they'll arrest the top al-Qaeda and two years later
[3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:38.320]  they'll say, oh, it was really protecting, we put him in a witness protection, it wasn't
[3:15:38.320 --> 3:15:39.320]  real
[3:15:39.320 --> 3:15:40.320]  Right
[3:15:40.320 --> 3:15:41.320]  Go ahead
[3:15:41.320 --> 3:15:45.480]  He was the guy that always got a big deal and it never came through, you know, I got
[3:15:45.480 --> 3:15:49.000]  ten million dollars coming in, you know, can I borrow twenty five so it gets here, that's
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  the kind of guy he was
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:55.280]  The other two guys, I mean, the one that went over to Jordan, that guy was mentally insane
[3:15:55.280 --> 3:15:59.080]  He was, I mean, I don't know if you know anything about a lot of Arabs, but Arabs usually got
[3:15:59.080 --> 3:16:00.080]  money
[3:16:00.080 --> 3:16:04.280]  This guy would come to a group of African Americans who were struggling, asking for five bucks
[3:16:04.280 --> 3:16:07.480]  to get the bus to go to school every day, so I don't know where he got the money to
[3:16:07.480 --> 3:16:11.600]  go to Jordan except that this guy paid for it and all the rest of the crap, then the
[3:16:11.600 --> 3:16:14.760]  other guy, he was just a young guy, he didn't really know what was going on, he tripped
[3:16:14.760 --> 3:16:18.600]  up into a situation, somebody told him some stuff and, you know, he watched some videos,
[3:16:18.600 --> 3:16:21.840]  next thing you know, he's in a terrorist thing, I mean, if you ever looked at him when he's
[3:16:21.840 --> 3:16:25.800]  coming out of court, he is just like a deer in headlights, I didn't really know those
[3:16:25.800 --> 3:16:29.920]  two guys at all, I mean, I barely knew their names, but, I mean, Alex, it's really, it's
[3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:34.200]  pretty ridiculous the way, and see people, a lot of people say, well, hey, you're Muslim
[3:16:34.200 --> 3:16:40.560]  and you know, you're guilty and it's okay, you should be a patriot and let the police
[3:16:40.560 --> 3:16:42.400]  come in and spy on you
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:46.320]  No, they say, you know, there's all this about how they love the Arabs, they're not racist
[3:16:46.320 --> 3:16:52.480]  or bigoted, let me tell you, in the military, you're called Haji's, and you're not human
[3:16:52.480 --> 3:16:56.520]  and it's a big joke when they just shot that little kid and the kid blows in half, they
[3:16:56.520 --> 3:16:59.640]  go, Rougler, I'm the little bastard, look at him cryin'
[3:16:59.640 --> 3:17:04.600]  I mean, it's just, you know, hey, let's get this family's car and run over it with a tank
[3:17:04.600 --> 3:17:12.840]  and there's video, look at this family drive-by, and it's just like, and these people think
[3:17:12.840 --> 3:17:17.800]  that they're going to be safe in a government run by people like this, no, they're going
[3:17:17.800 --> 3:17:20.800]  to loot and rob all of us folks, criminals are in control
[3:17:20.800 --> 3:17:27.280]  You are 100% right, Alex, and by the way, they fund and train the military to commit
[3:17:27.280 --> 3:17:31.960]  these atrocities and they put out the Abu Ghraib on purpose, the CIA put that out that's been
[3:17:31.960 --> 3:17:37.720]  documented, to make America be hated, and now they're saying America's fault for everything,
[3:17:37.720 --> 3:17:42.560]  it's going to implode, a new bank of the world's going to form, and you understand the mastermind
[3:17:42.560 --> 3:17:43.560]  setup of this
[3:17:43.560 --> 3:17:48.840]  Oh my God, Alex, everything you're saying is so true, man, watching it from the inside,
[3:17:48.840 --> 3:17:55.000]  I mean, obviously, I had a very small, I commend you for having the strength and the courage
[3:17:55.000 --> 3:18:00.680]  to put up with this crap on a regular and daily basis, I know you're a target nationally,
[3:18:00.680 --> 3:18:06.160]  and I can't even imagine, I mean, they had helicopters following us in crap, you can't
[3:18:06.160 --> 3:18:10.720]  believe the stuff, I mean, I don't talk much about it on air, it's been quite a circus,
[3:18:10.720 --> 3:18:15.720]  but you know, I just say, God, I'm doing the right thing, I try to, you know, just stay
[3:18:15.720 --> 3:18:21.000]  forward and it's not even fear anymore, it's just more gripping, like jumping into cold
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:25.560]  ice water, I'm just like, whoa, this is real, and that's how I can be up here at 2, 3 in
[3:18:25.560 --> 3:18:29.360]  the morning, totally exhausted with no sleep and keep working, because I go anytime they
[3:18:29.360 --> 3:18:32.960]  could set me up, anytime they could kill me, I just got to get, you know, more salvos into
[3:18:32.960 --> 3:18:36.400]  the enemy in the Info War, you know, I mean, literally, it's like I'm in a big gun firing
[3:18:36.400 --> 3:18:39.280]  at the enemy battleship, but it's coming at me firing, I'm like, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[3:18:39.280 --> 3:18:42.440]  boom, boom, boom, boom, and I just got to stay at my post and just keep firing, no matter
[3:18:42.440 --> 3:18:47.200]  what they do, but God bless you, my friend, I appreciate you calling the show, let's take
[3:18:47.200 --> 3:18:52.680]  another call here, let's talk to Rare in Taiwan, I'm gonna go to that first, that was Taiwan,
[3:18:52.680 --> 3:18:53.680]  Rare, thanks for holding.
[3:18:53.680 --> 3:18:56.200]  Hi, Alex, how are you?
[3:18:56.200 --> 3:18:57.200]  Welcome, good.

[3:19:11.760 --> 3:19:13.560]  mentoring there.
[3:19:13.560 --> 3:19:22.160]  I'm just curious, have you ever had investigative journalist, Mr. John Pilger, on your program?
[3:19:22.160 --> 3:19:28.120]  That name rings a bell, Pilger, what's he do?
[3:19:28.120 --> 3:19:38.680]  Well, his recent documentary, War on Democracy, just won the 2008 One World Award.

[3:21:01.560 --> 3:21:06.800]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[3:21:06.800 --> 3:21:10.760]  and we knew what to do, at least we thought we did.
[3:21:10.760 --> 3:21:16.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:17.640]  to tell their story.
[3:21:17.640 --> 3:21:26.600]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:21:26.600 --> 3:21:30.720]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth, as brave souls throughout the
[3:21:30.720 --> 3:21:33.640]  world take action against their global masters.
[3:21:33.640 --> 3:21:36.840]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[3:21:36.840 --> 3:21:42.640]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:21:42.640 --> 3:21:46.120]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[3:21:46.120 --> 3:21:51.960]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide, or order
[3:21:51.960 --> 3:21:54.640]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:21:54.640 --> 3:21:58.320]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[3:21:58.320 --> 3:22:00.480]  and bring in martial law.
[3:22:00.480 --> 3:22:05.480]  Hello, this is Peter Cronch Novel from Midos Resources and I'd like to share some thoughts
[3:22:05.480 --> 3:22:06.480]  with you.
[3:22:06.480 --> 3:22:10.840]  In today's economy, with the government spending on wild, the banking system on the verge of
[3:22:10.840 --> 3:22:15.520]  collapse, and Wall Street and continuous free fall, we both know that it's critical
[3:22:15.520 --> 3:22:18.520]  that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[3:22:18.520 --> 3:22:22.760]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets
[3:22:22.760 --> 3:22:23.760]  is very simple.
[3:22:23.760 --> 3:22:26.240]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[3:22:26.240 --> 3:22:29.840]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've
[3:22:29.840 --> 3:22:32.880]  never been more important in our country's history.
[3:22:32.880 --> 3:22:37.200]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[3:22:37.200 --> 3:22:38.200]  Give me a call.

[3:22:45.240 --> 3:22:46.240]  to your questions.

[3:23:05.920 --> 3:23:09.880]  what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make

[3:24:50.700 --> 3:24:55.600]  Yeah, again that's a rare calendar.
[3:24:55.600 --> 3:25:03.140]  Anyways, yeah the film is basically, probably the most important part about it is how the
[3:25:03.140 --> 3:25:09.360]  United States government backed the elites, supported the elites in Chile to overthrow
[3:25:09.360 --> 3:25:17.480]  the government, I forget the President's name now, but how it got twisted around and
[3:25:17.480 --> 3:25:20.280]  how the people came back
[3:25:20.280 --> 3:25:22.360]  uh... the regular people
[3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:24.480]  and uh...
[3:25:24.480 --> 3:25:25.320]  took him back
[3:25:25.320 --> 3:25:28.920]  out of that put him back into government if reinstalled him
[3:25:28.920 --> 3:25:31.300]  but it's a very interesting film
[3:25:31.300 --> 3:25:34.120]  uh... again it's war on democracy

[3:26:17.880 --> 3:26:18.520]  all
[3:26:18.520 --> 3:26:22.200]  all of this and new to politics and
[3:26:22.200 --> 3:26:23.640]  uh...
[3:26:23.640 --> 3:26:25.600]  it's been quite and
[3:26:25.600 --> 3:26:26.640]  and by opener
[3:26:26.640 --> 3:26:30.840]  uh... this this past election is what got me into it
[3:26:30.840 --> 3:26:35.680]  my mom got me into watching uh... fox me that first and i just with this one
[3:26:35.680 --> 3:26:37.880]  thing led to another
[3:26:37.880 --> 3:26:39.000]  led to another
[3:26:39.000 --> 3:26:41.920]  eventually uh... found your show
[3:26:41.920 --> 3:26:46.440]  and uh... you've opened up my eyes to quite a few things
[3:26:46.440 --> 3:26:48.800]  and uh... i listen to a lot of the
[3:26:48.800 --> 3:26:53.360]  radio shows out there just about all of them and uh... i think you're
[3:26:53.360 --> 3:26:56.560]  uh... the best out there because
[3:26:56.560 --> 3:27:01.560]  speaking actual truth uh... beat the other guys they're great
[3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:07.160]  it's like they're scared to talk about what really need to be talked about
[3:27:07.160 --> 3:27:10.680]  uh... or they didn't take a lot of them is a lot of great folks though
[3:27:10.680 --> 3:27:14.000]  some of them not pick about everybody else and it's it's a
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:16.120]  personal power trip
[3:27:16.120 --> 3:27:17.440]  for them
[3:27:17.440 --> 3:27:19.160]  and uh... it
[3:27:19.160 --> 3:27:22.640]  it's destructive some of it that goes on but you know what that that happens in
[3:27:22.640 --> 3:27:24.680]  any revolution in sterling
[3:27:24.680 --> 3:27:27.160]  that is what happens in dealing with millions of people
[3:27:27.160 --> 3:27:30.160]  and that's just uh... part of the ballgame here
[3:27:30.160 --> 3:27:36.960]  no i i i i just want to uh... just say that i'm really disgusted as an american
[3:27:36.960 --> 3:27:40.680]  or what is going on with our country uh...
[3:27:40.680 --> 3:27:43.520]  i served in marine corps for four years
[3:27:43.520 --> 3:27:44.560]  uh...
[3:27:44.560 --> 3:27:48.280]  you know in the first time i came back from my first
[3:27:48.280 --> 3:27:52.680]  uh... let's pack i'd literally kiss the ground when i came back in it
[3:27:52.680 --> 3:27:55.920]  and i cried i was i was happy to be back
[3:27:55.920 --> 3:27:57.440]  in america
[3:27:57.440 --> 3:28:00.240]  and uh...
[3:28:00.240 --> 3:28:02.240]  just really saddened
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:03.120]  by
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:04.920]  what's going on
[3:28:04.920 --> 3:28:08.200]  it really bothers me and um...
[3:28:08.200 --> 3:28:11.080]  i just got done watching one of your uh...
[3:28:11.080 --> 3:28:13.840]  videos on the um...
[3:28:13.840 --> 3:28:16.240]  uh... became you grow that you did
[3:28:16.240 --> 3:28:17.920]  nine years ago
[3:28:17.920 --> 3:28:20.240]  and one of the things that you said
[3:28:20.240 --> 3:28:24.720]  was that even if you're an atheist you should be very disturbed by this
[3:28:24.720 --> 3:28:27.560]  and you you hit it on the money
[3:28:27.560 --> 3:28:30.120]  and um... you know i've
[3:28:30.120 --> 3:28:31.000]  been
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:32.480]  pretty much raised
[3:28:32.480 --> 3:28:35.800]  eight years by an atheist my entire life
[3:28:35.800 --> 3:28:39.360]  uh... i don't consider myself an atheist anymore but for the majority of
[3:28:39.360 --> 3:28:41.760]  your life i have i i was
[3:28:41.760 --> 3:28:46.880]  and um...
[3:28:46.880 --> 3:28:49.840]  i believe you're right even if you should be
[3:28:49.840 --> 3:28:51.120]  it well the new world
[3:28:51.120 --> 3:28:54.280]  programers have taken over christianity
[3:28:54.280 --> 3:28:57.520]  to put out a false christianity to make it look wicked and evil
[3:28:57.520 --> 3:29:00.560]  when you really study the new world order you find out their cultist and they
[3:29:00.560 --> 3:29:02.120]  hate real christians
[3:29:02.120 --> 3:29:04.760]  and you find out that that is the major battle line
[3:29:04.760 --> 3:29:08.160]  and they just don't want people to realize that and then they
[3:29:08.160 --> 3:29:10.720]  no truly when you tap into god
[3:29:10.720 --> 3:29:14.000]  when you tap into you know that were species
[3:29:14.000 --> 3:29:16.560]  and we're all interconnected you do report you so
[3:29:16.560 --> 3:29:19.240]  and when you tap into the fact there is evil there is good
[3:29:19.240 --> 3:29:20.760]  then the whole
[3:29:20.760 --> 3:29:22.680]  system the whole panacea
[3:29:22.680 --> 3:29:24.160]  the whole
[3:29:24.160 --> 3:29:26.280]  plane in front of you that you see
[3:29:26.280 --> 3:29:28.040]  shifts into focus
[3:29:28.040 --> 3:29:31.160]  they don't want you to have that clarity that discernment
[3:29:31.160 --> 3:29:33.520]  so come on in god loves you
[3:29:33.520 --> 3:29:35.080]  and god wants you

[3:33:58.920 --> 3:34:02.920]  it is
[3:34:02.920 --> 3:34:07.000]  that's pumping me some audio in there okay let's rewind that and
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:09.880]  while we're figuring this out we've made some studio changes in here
[3:34:09.880 --> 3:34:13.800]  with the upcoming new show so who knows what's going on with that but let's
[3:34:13.800 --> 3:34:17.400]  skew it back up and see if we can get some audio
[3:34:17.400 --> 3:34:22.680]  on that feed so we can play that audio feed for everybody
[3:34:22.680 --> 3:34:27.880]  okay i have a backup system of minnesota minnesota this is cape crenaveral calling
[3:34:27.880 --> 3:34:31.560]  you have the cfr uh audio clip i sent you right
[3:34:31.560 --> 3:34:34.600]  it's already go ahead and play that for folks
[3:34:34.600 --> 3:34:38.520]  the second question that i'd like to pose
[3:34:38.520 --> 3:34:43.720]  relates to the forces driving the emergence of the second world
[3:34:43.720 --> 3:34:47.320]  and have they had an unintentional impact
[3:34:47.320 --> 3:34:50.680]  on something that have not been mentioned as well
[3:34:50.680 --> 3:34:54.840]  today in any of the discussions namely civil military relations
[3:34:54.840 --> 3:34:58.520]  in the united states like to call your attention
[3:34:58.520 --> 3:35:04.120]  to an analysis by charles dunlap in the us army war colleges
[3:35:04.120 --> 3:35:08.440]  academic magazine called parameters in this analysis
[3:35:08.440 --> 3:35:12.840]  mr dunlap predicts that there will be a military coup
[3:35:12.840 --> 3:35:18.440]  in the united states in the year 2012 in part because we've asked our military
[3:35:18.440 --> 3:35:22.440]  to do too much outside of the traditional national
[3:35:22.440 --> 3:35:29.560]  security realm for mr cannot have the emergence of the second world
[3:35:29.560 --> 3:35:33.880]  been so destabilizing as to lead to mission creep
[3:35:33.880 --> 3:35:37.960]  to the extent that it could lead the army war college
[3:35:37.960 --> 3:35:43.640]  to predict unofficially of course that there will be a military coup
[3:35:43.640 --> 3:35:47.720]  within the next three to four years all right stop right there
[3:35:47.720 --> 3:35:51.800]  there's already been a military coup but this is what the army war college is
[3:35:51.800 --> 3:35:54.600]  saying they're going to do separately and then they write other reports saying
[3:35:54.600 --> 3:35:58.280]  this is going to happen uh this is what happens when the
[3:35:58.280 --> 3:36:01.720]  military gets involved in your daily life it's why it's been illegal here
[3:36:01.720 --> 3:36:06.040]  it's not illegal in the congo not illegal in mexico not illegal in russia
[3:36:06.040 --> 3:36:11.240]  not illegal in china wasn't illegal in nazi germany
[3:36:11.240 --> 3:36:15.400]  it happened it will happen it is happening the denial
[3:36:15.400 --> 3:36:22.520]  has to end okay uh were we able to get audio and video back or just did never
[3:36:22.520 --> 3:36:27.080]  again we'll have it okay uh boy um that's a good thing for you
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:29.240]  tonight with the show coming up that you know that now
[3:36:29.240 --> 3:36:34.120]  um let's uh go ahead and play the audio of ron paul at the big c pack
[3:36:34.120 --> 3:36:37.080]  neocon meeting where he talks about we killed a million
[3:36:37.080 --> 3:36:43.000]  plus iraqis and he talks about how war isn't good and the people actually
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:46.040]  cheer him showing that mainline conservatives
[3:36:46.040 --> 3:36:48.920]  you got the most donations of military of any candidate
[3:36:48.920 --> 3:36:52.120]  actually aren't for this just like the media claims all his spanish one open
[3:36:52.120 --> 3:36:56.040]  borders gallup poll shows upwards of 80 percent or higher
[3:36:56.040 --> 3:36:59.000]  that's a group think of his panic as well i better be for open borders then
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:02.520]  because all his panics are for it not true i'm a conservative i better be for
[3:37:02.520 --> 3:37:04.920]  war because all conservatives are for now the democrats are like well i guess
[3:37:04.920 --> 3:37:08.520]  we're pro-war because now obama's for it this is this group thing
[3:37:08.520 --> 3:37:13.720]  let's go ahead and uh play the ron paul speech here it is
[3:37:13.720 --> 3:37:17.320]  but we ought to address the subject of foreign policy part of the reasons why
[3:37:17.320 --> 3:37:21.000]  we last lost this last election was the foreign policy issue
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:25.080]  generally speaking the presidential candidate who argues the case
[3:37:25.080 --> 3:37:28.600]  for less war monitoring will win the election
[3:37:28.600 --> 3:37:32.440]  and of course obama took the advantage of it you know he says i'm going to war
[3:37:32.440 --> 3:37:36.280]  and in uh in uh in iraq and i'm going to bring those troops home and solve all
[3:37:36.280 --> 3:37:39.960]  the problems and uh he won the election
[3:37:39.960 --> 3:37:44.120]  so this generally is the case but the truth is
[3:37:44.120 --> 3:37:47.880]  foreign policy hasn't changed we should be looking more
[3:37:47.880 --> 3:37:51.160]  to what george bush said in the year 2000
[3:37:51.160 --> 3:37:55.560]  he was strongly critical of the clinton years of nation building and being in
[3:37:55.560 --> 3:38:00.120]  the policeman of the world what we were doing in bosnia and somalia
[3:38:00.120 --> 3:38:03.560]  and he won the election he said some very very good things
[3:38:03.560 --> 3:38:06.920]  but after that he again joined the internationalist
[3:38:06.920 --> 3:38:10.360]  joined this idea that the american taxpayers you
[3:38:10.360 --> 3:38:13.880]  have an obligation to take care of everybody in police the world
[3:38:13.880 --> 3:38:17.720]  and put our military out there and be exposed to all this danger
[3:38:17.720 --> 3:38:22.040]  it doesn't make any sense this is literally what banks rubs the country
[3:38:22.040 --> 3:38:25.640]  is the international expenditures it costs us a trillion dollars
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:29.320]  a year to take care of our foreign policy
[3:38:29.320 --> 3:38:40.280]  and that cannot last and it is it is coming to an end
[3:38:40.280 --> 3:38:44.360]  matter of fact the person most pleased with our foreign policy is osama ben
[3:38:44.360 --> 3:38:47.320]  laudan because he has written about this and he said
[3:38:47.320 --> 3:38:50.600]  i am going to get you to come over here and we'll
[3:38:50.600 --> 3:38:54.920]  fight you on our sand and we will do what we did to the soviets
[3:38:54.920 --> 3:38:58.040]  of course we helped him do what he did to the soviets
[3:38:58.040 --> 3:39:02.440]  because we subsidized and supported him to drain the soviets
[3:39:02.440 --> 3:39:06.920]  and he said he will do the same thing he will eventually bankrupt this country
[3:39:06.920 --> 3:39:13.240]  and lo and behold we are weaker for it our military personnel are fatigued
[3:39:13.240 --> 3:39:16.520]  i was very proud of what happened last year in the campaign
[3:39:16.520 --> 3:39:20.600]  because i talk about the old conservative republican non-interventionist
[3:39:20.600 --> 3:39:25.960]  constitutional foreign policy and we in our campaign got the most money
[3:39:25.960 --> 3:39:30.440]  than any candidate from the military
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:42.280]  but historically great nations end when they overextend themselves overseas
[3:39:42.280 --> 3:39:45.960]  whether it's back to the roman days or the soviets or whatever
[3:39:45.960 --> 3:39:50.840]  the country feels so in bolden that they go and they think
[3:39:50.840 --> 3:39:54.680]  themselves as being overly wonderful and that we are going to spread our
[3:39:54.680 --> 3:39:57.880]  message it actually started in world war one
[3:39:57.880 --> 3:40:01.640]  the truth is there was no need for us to be involved in world war one
[3:40:01.640 --> 3:40:04.840]  but who wasn't
[3:40:06.120 --> 3:40:10.360]  for there it was it was woodrow wilson said we have to do it because we have to
[3:40:10.360 --> 3:40:13.320]  make the world safe for democracy which led to this
[3:40:13.320 --> 3:40:17.560]  millions hundreds of millions of people killed in the 20th century
[3:40:17.560 --> 3:40:21.640]  so back we're back at the same thing we have to go and spread our goodness in
[3:40:21.640 --> 3:40:24.760]  the middle east so yeah we want to get rid of a bad guy in
[3:40:24.760 --> 3:40:29.640]  iraq we did but it cost it cost it cost it took a
[3:40:29.640 --> 3:40:34.520]  month another one million iraqis got killed believe me
[3:40:34.520 --> 3:40:37.960]  they weren't they weren't all terrorists some people
[3:40:37.960 --> 3:40:42.120]  didn't particularly like that but nevertheless it pleased
[3:40:42.120 --> 3:40:46.680]  asama ben laden because we were there we were bankrupting our country
[3:40:46.680 --> 3:40:50.360]  and right now today we get a new president that says he
[3:40:50.360 --> 3:40:53.640]  doesn't like he didn't like the war that was going on
[3:40:53.640 --> 3:40:58.040]  so what are we going to do we're going to drag another 17 000 americans
[3:40:58.040 --> 3:41:02.040]  and pump them into afghanistan don't we know
[3:41:02.040 --> 3:41:05.880]  anything about history it is bankrupting our country
[3:41:05.880 --> 3:41:09.720]  it will end whether the people agree with me or not it will end
[3:41:09.720 --> 3:41:13.160]  because we can't afford it that's why it's always ended throughout history
[3:41:13.160 --> 3:41:17.720]  that's what the financial crisis is telling us the welfare state will end
[3:41:17.720 --> 3:41:21.640]  because the money will quit working and we will no longer be able to afford
[3:41:21.640 --> 3:41:26.280]  to promote what we're doing around the world and as soon as we realize that
[3:41:26.280 --> 3:41:29.080]  uh the better
[3:41:29.800 --> 3:41:33.880]  all right well that was congressman ron paul and obviously i disagree with him
[3:41:33.880 --> 3:41:37.080]  about the asama ben laden thing the real asama ben laden letters that came out
[3:41:37.080 --> 3:41:40.360]  said he didn't do 9 11 he was a cia operative
[3:41:40.360 --> 3:41:44.200]  his family builds all the major u.s military bases in saudi arabian
[3:41:44.200 --> 3:41:48.440]  surrounding areas but he you know he's playing politics with the cpaq and
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:53.240]  bringing up that real terrorism real terrorist groups anybody that resist
[3:41:53.240 --> 3:41:56.840]  has been increased by the occupation of iraq
[3:41:56.840 --> 3:42:00.920]  and afghanistan and but there they are cheering to not wanting to be in the
[3:42:00.920 --> 3:42:04.600]  war cheering to uh when they're shown the logic of
[3:42:04.600 --> 3:42:08.120]  all of this this is cpaq and he was the lone voice
[3:42:08.120 --> 3:42:11.240]  there out of all the republicans uh that were there rush limbaugh and shan
[3:42:11.240 --> 3:42:15.400]  hennedy and countless others in that two-day event rush limbaugh speech was
[3:42:15.400 --> 3:42:19.880]  carried on fox and c span but not ron paul should have been
[3:42:19.880 --> 3:42:23.960]  um though it was carried on some national news
[3:42:23.960 --> 3:42:27.800]  stations because the establishment's having to admit ron paul is huge
[3:42:27.800 --> 3:42:31.480]  ron paul is having an effect people are really waking up to the message that the
[3:42:31.480 --> 3:42:35.800]  banks are behind it engineering it i want to get into with jason berman's
[3:42:35.800 --> 3:42:39.400]  uh this global new deal and gordon brown is always calling for a new world
[3:42:39.400 --> 3:42:41.320]  lord of the prime minister of england coming over here
[3:42:41.320 --> 3:42:45.720]  to sell this new global banking system to stop the bad banks
[3:42:45.720 --> 3:42:49.080]  who are the ones setting up and that financed him and are setting up the
[3:42:49.080 --> 3:42:52.280]  global banking system so we're going to go to that here in just a moment first
[3:42:52.280 --> 3:42:55.320]  off a few sponsors i want folks to know about
[3:42:55.320 --> 3:42:59.240]  to make this radio show possible survival seed bank dot com in a real crisis
[3:42:59.240 --> 3:43:03.240]  having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability
[3:43:03.240 --> 3:43:06.840]  to grow an endless supply of nutrient dense food to feed your loved ones
[3:43:06.840 --> 3:43:09.640]  there have been times in american history pilgrim for example when seeds
[3:43:09.640 --> 3:43:12.440]  had the highest value of any barter item even silver or gold
[3:43:12.440 --> 3:43:15.720]  there's a war on against non-hybrid seeds i got a bbc article about another

[3:45:01.400 --> 3:45:04.840]  globalization here and admitting alex over the weekend
[3:45:04.840 --> 3:45:08.520]  to a global shadow banking system you see this is something that
[3:45:08.520 --> 3:45:12.040]  you have talked about since the inception of your show and now the e u
[3:45:12.040 --> 3:45:15.800]  leaders are talking about it in order to establish not only that it's real
[3:45:15.800 --> 3:45:18.440]  but more global supervision but it's a bait to switch
[3:45:18.440 --> 3:45:21.400]  oh you've discovered there's a secret global banking system that ran the
[3:45:21.400 --> 3:45:24.680]  collapse of we're going to fix it with a new global bank
[3:45:24.680 --> 3:45:28.760]  made up of the very banks running it all and it'll be called the new world
[3:45:28.760 --> 3:45:33.000]  order it's all over the news i mean this is an incredible bait and switch
[3:45:33.000 --> 3:45:36.040]  absolutely like a bank robber when the police show up dressing in a police
[3:45:36.040 --> 3:45:40.440]  uniform going that they went that way uh let me manage the bank next time i'll
[3:45:40.440 --> 3:45:43.960]  fix it yeah absolutely let me just read a couple of the quotes right here
[3:45:43.960 --> 3:45:48.040]  um he is calling for a more rigorous global supervision of a banking system
[3:45:48.040 --> 3:45:52.280]  on saturday and he's saying that this is a we have to have global
[3:45:52.280 --> 3:45:56.120]  supervision of what is a shadow global system
[3:45:56.120 --> 3:45:59.560]  here he calls it an international shadow banking system
[3:45:59.560 --> 3:46:03.240]  an international shadow banking system something again you have talked about
[3:46:03.240 --> 3:46:06.760]  for over a decade but the problem is i have a news article i was going through
[3:46:06.760 --> 3:46:10.280]  a stack from two months ago with the head of the Rothschild family saying
[3:46:10.280 --> 3:46:13.720]  we're setting up a global government the final global banks about to be set up
[3:46:13.720 --> 3:46:18.360]  world government i mean it's just all over the news it's there and you know
[3:46:18.360 --> 3:46:22.040]  he's also calling for a global new deal with the u.s it's right here
[3:46:22.040 --> 3:46:25.800]  okay this is financial terrorism they're saying let us have our world
[3:46:25.800 --> 3:46:28.920]  government and then we'll turn the economy back on yeah absolutely because
[3:46:28.920 --> 3:46:33.000]  they got us debilitated on a respirator and then they turn the respirator off
[3:46:33.000 --> 3:46:36.360]  they hit us on the head drained our blood put us on a respirator and they're
[3:46:36.360 --> 3:46:39.640]  leaning over to schooling give us total control and we'll turn the respirator
[3:46:39.640 --> 3:46:44.840]  back on do you agree do you agree he wants president obama to agree to bold
[3:46:44.840 --> 3:46:49.800]  global action a global grand bargain it's now not just necessary but vital
[3:46:49.800 --> 3:46:52.920]  for a world economy and here he's saying
[3:46:52.920 --> 3:46:57.160]  um that we need this global new deal in order to
[3:46:57.160 --> 3:47:01.160]  have a truly global society it's all about
[3:47:01.160 --> 3:47:05.560]  globalism alex and you know it's a global government for a global crisis
[3:47:05.560 --> 3:47:09.560]  talk about global picks uh... what do we have here well he just named sobellis who
[3:47:09.560 --> 3:47:12.600]  is the kansas governor who was of course at the bill de berg group she's on the
[3:47:12.600 --> 3:47:16.520]  official list to his administration so if people out there don't understand that
[3:47:16.520 --> 3:47:19.800]  these secret meetings are where they decide who's going to be in the
[3:47:19.800 --> 3:47:23.640]  administration making it's right here okay it's not
[3:47:23.640 --> 3:47:27.160]  a coincidence that barack obama and hillary clinton were at the bill de
[3:47:27.160 --> 3:47:29.800]  berg meeting this year and that they're taking bill de berger's
[3:47:29.800 --> 3:47:34.680]  into their administration we need we we need to get this out there alex because
[3:47:34.680 --> 3:47:38.680]  in this shadow system is becoming more and more out in the open we have to make
[3:47:38.680 --> 3:47:40.840]  sure that they don't pull this bait and switch
[3:47:40.840 --> 3:47:44.920]  where they offer just another globalist solution to a problem that they
[3:47:44.920 --> 3:47:49.000]  created and it's not a problem that's why we have henry kissinger in and those
[3:47:49.000 --> 3:47:51.720]  same articles there's two from the times of london with brown
[3:47:51.720 --> 3:47:56.360]  he's saying this crisis is not a crisis it's an opportunity to bring in a new
[3:47:56.360 --> 3:48:02.040]  order a new world order we will do we will defeat the vicious evil banks
[3:48:02.040 --> 3:48:06.200]  with the very same bankers ruling us that's how we'll defeat them
[3:48:06.200 --> 3:48:09.880]  and you know alexa seems to tie in with the carbon credit system because no no
[3:48:09.880 --> 3:48:12.840]  they i got it all in the document you're gonna pay your carbon credits to them
[3:48:12.840 --> 3:48:17.640]  and gordon brown is one of these guys he is just a global warming
[3:48:17.640 --> 3:48:21.960]  season season immediately in fact you know i think i printed you an article
[3:48:21.960 --> 3:48:25.480]  last week that you didn't go over but now they're saying that toilet paper alex
[3:48:25.480 --> 3:48:29.800]  it's worse than uh suv's and us americans beef chicken
[3:48:29.800 --> 3:48:33.080]  asphalt natural gas your homes
[3:48:33.080 --> 3:48:38.120]  windows and trash pickup thousands of new taxes i keep saying hundreds i mean
[3:48:38.120 --> 3:48:40.360]  doing research for this film it's everything
[3:48:40.360 --> 3:48:43.560]  yeah everything with with federal international taxes
[3:48:43.560 --> 3:48:46.600]  paid directly to the new bank of the world i mean really what's good what's
[3:48:46.600 --> 3:48:49.720]  it gonna be like in 20 years are we just gonna get a go 20 years they've
[3:48:49.720 --> 3:48:52.520]  announced they're gonna put satellite tracker boxes in all the cars
[3:48:52.520 --> 3:48:55.480]  yeah well i think that's even probably the next five ten i don't think that's
[3:48:55.480 --> 3:48:58.840]  even to be 20 down the line i mean if we don't do no states are already putting
[3:48:58.840 --> 3:49:01.640]  it in like oregon they're doing tests here in austin with people
[3:49:01.640 --> 3:49:05.000]  with them in their cars and then when opposition builds obama goes we're not
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:07.720]  gonna do that right now and they move forward
[3:49:07.720 --> 3:49:11.000]  well i mean you know people are still bamboozled i i don't hear the outcry
[3:49:11.000 --> 3:49:14.520]  now to end the war now that obama has given us this very convenient
[3:49:14.520 --> 3:49:17.800]  now i have liberals when we go downtown to be a videotape clips for the film
[3:49:17.800 --> 3:49:20.360]  what do you think of obama it's like he's got to keep the troops there for
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:23.480]  security yeah you know well well he said that the
[3:49:23.480 --> 3:49:27.800]  secret arrest is going to continue to keep it safe from alcada
[3:49:27.800 --> 3:49:31.800]  and and you just can't get through to them i mean when you now tell somebody
[3:49:31.800 --> 3:49:35.160]  that he's planning to have combat troops and there's no such thing as a non
[3:49:35.160 --> 3:49:38.920]  combat troop in there until the end of 2011
[3:49:38.920 --> 3:49:42.280]  okay this is yet staging for another election year he's going to redistribute
[3:49:42.280 --> 3:49:45.320]  the forces in afghanistan but even at the end of 2011
[3:49:45.320 --> 3:49:49.800]  he's saying 50 000 troops and i'm not going to be surprised when we get to
[3:49:49.800 --> 3:49:54.360]  2011 and it's not 50 000 it's 150 000 and the iraqi special
[3:49:54.360 --> 3:49:57.960]  forces that we've trained are now going into places like afghanistan and
[3:49:57.960 --> 3:50:01.080]  other parts of the middle east aiding us you know they're going to be our allies
[3:50:01.080 --> 3:50:04.520]  and we're really in that psychology you say us and i do that too like it's
[3:50:04.520 --> 3:50:07.960]  still our military still our country until we realize it's not our government
[3:50:07.960 --> 3:50:11.240]  it's not our military and take it back it's only gonna get worse i agree i
[3:50:11.240 --> 3:50:14.200]  agree and i i really hope that people step up
[3:50:14.200 --> 3:50:18.280]  and take this president and his administration to task folks 2011
[3:50:18.280 --> 3:50:21.560]  especially the other talking december of 2011
[3:50:21.560 --> 3:50:24.760]  is completely and totally unacceptable and it's not even
[3:50:24.760 --> 3:50:28.680]  a complete withdrawal i mean we don't know they're saying major combat
[3:50:28.680 --> 3:50:32.280]  operations will be over in a year and a half
[3:50:32.280 --> 3:50:37.240]  or longer when bush said six months into the war five and a half years ago that
[3:50:37.240 --> 3:50:40.440]  major combat operations were now over it was over so he's using

[3:55:26.600 --> 3:55:28.360]  try to go over the modern new world order
[3:55:28.360 --> 3:55:31.880]  we're gonna show the gordon brown new world order speech just to get people
[3:55:31.880 --> 3:55:34.680]  associated with who this guy is i think we're gonna be seeing him in the news
[3:55:34.680 --> 3:55:38.840]  especially in the united states a lot in the next six months as they restructure
[3:55:38.840 --> 3:55:44.040]  an overt globalist banker takeover which i'm calling obama now as they said in
[3:55:44.040 --> 3:55:47.000]  the trilateral commission in the seventies they would get us all in debt
[3:55:47.000 --> 3:55:50.440]  implode the economy and then they're the bankers that have the fiat currency
[3:55:50.440 --> 3:55:54.760]  for the whole world you know i was looking at that oh obama magazine that's out
[3:55:54.760 --> 3:55:57.000]  there on the stands and i didn't even realize
[3:55:57.000 --> 3:56:00.120]  i mean this guy is the total frontman that this wasn't a time
[3:56:00.120 --> 3:56:03.960]  magazine it's set up like time magazine it looks exactly like time magazine
[3:56:03.960 --> 3:56:06.360]  except for where it says time it says obama
[3:56:06.360 --> 3:56:10.520]  and erin's like take a look at this and i look at it and right away i think it's
[3:56:10.520 --> 3:56:13.800]  time magazine then i realize it has a twelve dollar price tag and i'm like
[3:56:13.800 --> 3:56:17.880]  well what is this and you open it up and it is just complete
[3:56:17.880 --> 3:56:21.640]  propaganda it is a total obama no no folks and
[3:56:21.640 --> 3:56:24.840]  they've never in u.s history put this much propaganda behind somebody they're
[3:56:24.840 --> 3:56:27.960]  playing terror attacks you watch more wars
[3:56:27.960 --> 3:56:31.800]  so they got to get this this group of zombies to do whatever he says
[3:56:31.800 --> 3:56:35.080]  so they can use that group of the american people as a weapon through his
[3:56:35.080 --> 3:56:38.120]  obama brigade which they're openly set up under the pentagon it's it's now
[3:56:38.120 --> 3:56:42.440]  official they're doing it against the people that's why the obama deception
[3:56:42.440 --> 3:56:45.320]  is so important i mean we're really taking the new world order on
[3:56:45.320 --> 3:56:48.520]  toe-to-toe the first obama film and it's gonna be the most hardcore
[3:56:48.520 --> 3:56:52.040]  all his lies all his trees in his globalist agenda and it's really all
[3:56:52.040 --> 3:56:54.840]  about the banking system how they're setting up a new bank of the world
[3:56:54.840 --> 3:57:00.200]  totally timely listeners you have to make this film go mega viral at

[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:32.280]  well as hd interviews that you guys shot so this is probably
[3:57:32.280 --> 3:57:35.560]  visually the most high quality prison planet production
[3:57:35.560 --> 3:57:39.000]  out there yet and it just looks totally and completely impressive we shot it in
[3:57:39.000 --> 3:57:42.760]  hd but it won't be total hd on the dvd but it has the hd look
[3:57:42.760 --> 3:57:46.440]  yeah exactly exactly me obviously have to compress the dvd but it's really has a
[3:57:46.440 --> 3:57:51.160]  clean clean clean look and rob has really outdone himself with the editing
[3:57:51.160 --> 3:57:54.200]  the special effects you've gotten for this thing look great i'm in love with
[3:57:54.200 --> 3:57:57.560]  the cover i think the girl you got to do the cover i think that's going to be an
[3:57:57.560 --> 3:58:00.520]  iconic image i think that's going to be passed around just the cover
[3:58:00.520 --> 3:58:03.480]  is going to make people want to see this film well folks haven't seen the
[3:58:03.480 --> 3:58:07.000]  official cover yet but it's similar to the obama deception.net website
