[00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:10.292]  Coming up in a few minutes, we're going to play this little two-minute news piece from a local NBC station in Kansas City.
[00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:16.374]  Of course, we happen to have an affiliate, KCXL, doing a great job in Kansas City.
[00:00:16.374 --> 00:00:21.975]  But this is a problem that faces America, that faces Iraq, that faces Serbia, that faces Afghanistan.
[00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:27.917]  There are over 10 proving grounds in the United States where DU, depleted uranium, munitions are used.
[00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:37.439]  Depleted uranium is a by-product of nuclear weapons production and of spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants.
[00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:44.323]  The heavy metal effect of it is deadly enough and will kill you or make you very ill.
[00:00:44.323 --> 00:00:53.589]  But the New York Daily News about 8 months ago did a test of 14 different soldiers who said they were ill and were losing weight.
[00:00:54.517 --> 00:00:55.857]  Having these high fevers?
[00:00:55.857 --> 00:01:01.419]  Every one of them had high levels of radiation upwards of two rims.
[00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:05.860]  Two rims will kill most people in long-term exposure.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.082]  And it's long-term exposure because it sits in the lungs and settles out in the bones.
[00:01:12.082 --> 00:01:16.584]  And do we have that news clip?
[00:01:16.584 --> 00:01:17.804]  John, did you say we have that clip?
[00:01:18.473 --> 00:01:33.489]  Okay, let's go ahead and play that clip, and then we'll go... I know it's hard for him to listen to again, but Duane Garten, father of Clay Garten, who spent 16 months in Iraq, but here's that little newscast clip, and our hearts and prayers just go out to him.
[00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:37.153]  There'll be a phone number at the end of how you can contribute to the family.
[00:01:37.153 --> 00:01:38.394]  I think it's a good idea.
[00:01:38.394 --> 00:01:39.035]  Go ahead and play it.
[00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:42.818]  A soldier survives Iraq, but dies of a mysterious illness.
[00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:43.819]  Do you have a job?
[00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.499]  The government is hiding.
[00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:50.121]  NBC Action News reporter Ron Mott is live with the story you'll see only on NBC Action News.
[00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:50.781]  Ron?
[00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:56.343]  Elizabeth, it's a complaint heard all over the country that soldiers are being poisoned by their own ammo.
[00:01:56.343 --> 00:02:02.746]  They of course are made to kill the enemy, but as one Raytown family says, they've turned into unfriendly fire.
[00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:05.787]  You know, they come out five minutes and said, he's gone.
[00:02:10.426 --> 00:02:15.689]  For nearly a year and a half, Dwayne Garton worried that his son might return from Iraq in a body bag.
[00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.151]  This is worse than they could have got killed over here, really.
[00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:30.859]  Instead, decorated 35-year-old Army Sergeant Clay Garton spent an agonizing three weeks dying in his parents' Raytown home and at the VA hospital, eventually losing the fight the day after Christmas.
[00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.301]  35 years, I had no boy.
[00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:38.084]  He went through 16 months of hell and didn't come back and they didn't do nothing for him.
[00:02:38.923 --> 00:02:42.946]  That's what I don't understand, why they couldn't do something for him.
[00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:46.108]  This is Seth, and this is Mr. Gage.
[00:02:46.108 --> 00:02:57.736]  A father of three, Claygarton's family believes the army medic is every bit a casualty of war as those who die on the front lines, after they say he became exposed to depleted uranium dust used in some US ammunition.
[00:02:57.736 --> 00:03:00.538]  The government contends the health risks are low.
[00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:02.499]  I think they know exactly what's going on.
[00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:08.066]  I think these troops over there are all in danger of this stuff.
[00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:18.574]  The family says Garten lost 30 pounds before he died starting with a debilitating back spasm earlier this month that was followed by a series of high fevers reaching 106 degrees.
[00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:28.363]  It was hard to watch my son from such a big, strong, intelligent man to turn into a small
[00:03:30.337 --> 00:03:34.440]  Meanwhile, a grieving father mourns his lost fishing and hunting buddy.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.781]  That's the only way I can remember him.
[00:03:36.781 --> 00:03:38.922]  I don't want to remember this.
[00:03:38.922 --> 00:03:41.023]  It's too painful.
[00:03:41.023 --> 00:03:44.225]  If you were in my body right now, you'd know how hard it hurts.
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.463]  A memorial fund has been set up in Clay Garten's name to benefit his three kids.
[00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:54.206]  For more information, call the Bank of America Raytown branch at 816-979-6292.
[00:03:54.206 --> 00:04:02.092]  And the family did have tissue samples taken from Clay Garten's body, hoping that they will lead to some concrete answers.
[00:04:02.092 --> 00:04:04.253]  Reporting live tonight, Ron Mott, NBC News.
[00:04:04.253 --> 00:04:07.576]  Alright, now again, we really support the troops here.
[00:04:07.576 --> 00:04:09.297]  So we want the D.E.U.
[00:04:09.297 --> 00:04:10.318]  to stop being used
[00:04:11.725 --> 00:04:17.771]  And we do support their family members, but you notice these neocons, they don't want to talk about it.
[00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:19.092]  They don't want to support these families.
[00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:22.715]  They don't even give treatment, and there is treatment, to these soldiers when they're sick.
[00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:24.316]  They just deny it even exists.
[00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:34.405]  We have interviewed many times, he's coming on in about 15 minutes, Dr. Doug Rocky, who literally wrote the book, the training manual, in the 80's on DU and is sick from it.
[00:04:34.405 --> 00:04:38.449]  Many of his team have died from it, from removing records from the first Gulf War.
[00:04:39.128 --> 00:04:45.670]  So, the world expert will be joining us, and the government knows full well what it does, and they don't care.
[00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.651]  I know it was hard for you to hear that again.
[00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:55.074]  Dwayne Garton, father of Army Specialist, a medic, Clay Garton, who's gone home to be with the Lord.
[00:04:55.074 --> 00:04:58.375]  Dwayne, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:04:58.375 --> 00:04:58.935]  Thank you, sir.
[00:04:58.935 --> 00:05:01.896]  I appreciate it, because we've got to get word out.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.501]  We've got to stop this.
[00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:07.943]  I know the administration don't really care.
[00:05:07.943 --> 00:05:12.105]  You can tell that by the way Romfield does things.
[00:05:12.105 --> 00:05:16.026]  And the way he answered the truthful aware about the armament on the vehicles.
[00:05:16.026 --> 00:05:18.407]  My son was a helicopter paramedic.
[00:05:18.407 --> 00:05:22.549]  He flew 300 some odd missions over there in 16 months.
[00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:27.712]  He was called out one night and there was an army personnel carrier.
[00:05:28.297 --> 00:05:30.578]  That had been hit with one of these bullets.
[00:05:30.578 --> 00:05:33.780]  And the corpsman that was in that unit was the one that was hit.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.741]  He tore his arm off.
[00:05:36.741 --> 00:05:43.285]  And my son went inside the vehicle to stabilize him so they could transport him to the hospital.
[00:05:43.285 --> 00:05:43.945]  Let me stop you.
[00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:45.886]  This was a friendly fire incident?
[00:05:45.886 --> 00:05:49.748]  No, this was the enemy, but they had our weapons show.
[00:05:49.748 --> 00:05:50.828]  Yeah, it's been reported.
[00:05:50.828 --> 00:05:52.609]  Yeah, they've been shooting up the Abrams too.
[00:05:52.609 --> 00:05:53.590]  They've got it, yes.
[00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.690]  Yes.
[00:05:55.482 --> 00:06:01.804]  And he said they got him back to the hospital and had him there for a day and then they shipped him to another place.
[00:06:01.804 --> 00:06:04.405]  And he died the day after that.
[00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:10.207]  From his wounds to his arm and probably the uranium that got into his system so quick that way.
[00:06:10.207 --> 00:06:12.628]  So your son was inside the vehicle that had been hit?
[00:06:12.628 --> 00:06:13.568]  Yes sir.
[00:06:13.568 --> 00:06:17.990]  And again it aerosolizes and turns into a fine microscopic powder?
[00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.711]  Right.
[00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:23.512]  And it, you know when he came home we met him at Fort Bragg
[00:06:24.005 --> 00:06:26.506]  When he came off the plate, they held him over.
[00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:28.988]  He was supposed to get out in April this year.
[00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:34.751]  They kept him until October this year, but they brought him home the last part of May or the first part of June.
[00:06:34.751 --> 00:06:36.872]  It's so confusing, I can't remember.
[00:06:36.872 --> 00:06:43.016]  But me and his mother drove from here to Fort Bragg to meet him, and he was just as healthy and nice.
[00:06:43.016 --> 00:06:49.520]  Then he had to do the rest of his duty there, and he had some time saved up.
[00:06:50.586 --> 00:07:05.190]  So he took his leave just before the 1st of October because he had 50 days left and he stayed here with us because his home and his stuff was not ready for him.
[00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.172]  Two days before he had this massive spasm in his muscles and everything.
[00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:24.762]  His furniture arrived two days after that and we moved everything into the house but he was not capable of staying there because he couldn't take care of himself.
[00:07:24.762 --> 00:07:31.563]  In December of 70 he turned 35 and I had to give him showers because he couldn't take care of himself.
[00:07:31.563 --> 00:07:34.664]  We took him to the hospital seven times before they even admitted him.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.921]  He's up there every day.
[00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:40.242]  That's the VA, sir?
[00:07:40.242 --> 00:07:41.804]  Yes, sir, in Kansas City.
[00:07:41.804 --> 00:07:43.985]  The famous Kansas City VA.
[00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:47.948]  We call it the Oversized Morgue.
[00:07:47.948 --> 00:07:51.671]  I don't mean to bring this up, but we have to do this to save other troops.
[00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:52.872]  You better believe it, sir.
[00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:59.437]  If I could save one out of any of them by doing this, I'll do it in a minute.
[00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:04.100]  The main thing I was really concerned about is my three grandbabies.
[00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:11.152]  Four, three, and two, and I've got to have a father.
[00:08:11.152 --> 00:08:34.776]  And we had the memorial service last night for him, and they were there, and the littlest one, he's two, he kept pointing and said, Daddy, Daddy, you know, he don't understand, but you know, the Waystar men and women over there like this, just because some bureaucrat wants to
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.321]  Get after somebody that threatened his father when he was in office.
[00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:41.201]  It's just not right.
[00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:44.222]  I mean, he's taken our defenses from here.
[00:08:44.222 --> 00:08:46.142]  He's taken all of our National Guard.
[00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:49.183]  This which is supposed to be home security, home, you know.
[00:08:49.183 --> 00:08:52.924]  So what happens if they invade us with all of our troops everywhere else?
[00:08:52.924 --> 00:08:54.744]  And they're getting killed over there.
[00:08:54.744 --> 00:09:02.026]  Well, let me just bring up that particular VA because they didn't help your son according to what you told me during the break when we first talked.
[00:09:04.483 --> 00:09:08.104]  Are you aware of the maggot deaths there in the hospital?
[00:09:08.104 --> 00:09:09.225]  Of the what?
[00:09:09.225 --> 00:09:15.047]  Were you aware that World War II and Korean War vets are strapped down in that VA and have died from maggots entering their brains?
[00:09:15.047 --> 00:09:16.067]  Yes, sir.
[00:09:16.067 --> 00:09:23.569]  But my son said take them to the VA, so, if you know... Well, I know, I know, I mean, that's... I'm not... I'm just saying this is... Oh, I know, I see what you're saying, yes.
[00:09:23.569 --> 00:09:25.770]  This is what they think of our veterans.
[00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.590]  Right.
[00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:32.632]  They were supposed to have had a big shake-up here and everything and redone everything and my son was in...
[00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:40.775]  And they put him in an intensive care unit where he had to put on a gown and a mask and everything to go in.
[00:09:40.775 --> 00:09:47.620]  And they didn't tell him that they'd had a fire in their electrical room and the button on the bed didn't work.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.802]  And he kept pressing the button for the nurse to come in and help him.
[00:09:50.802 --> 00:09:57.087]  And he laid in there 15 minutes and then crapped all over himself before anybody came in.
[00:09:57.087 --> 00:09:59.228]  It was about 20 minutes after that.
[00:09:59.228 --> 00:10:01.210]  So, I mean, yeah, they don't care up there.
[00:10:01.886 --> 00:10:03.746]  It's just sickening.
[00:10:03.746 --> 00:10:14.368]  And then after he passed away at 825, the day after Christmas, they came out and told us they was going to try CPR on him.
[00:10:14.368 --> 00:10:17.329]  And I said, you know, you've done lost him.
[00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:19.209]  Don't, you know, don't do anything.
[00:10:19.209 --> 00:10:22.130]  Just let, you know, leave him go because he's gone.
[00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:29.151]  And I said, I'd appreciate it if you remove all the tubes and everything so me and my wife can come in and see him before you take him away.
[00:10:29.969 --> 00:10:34.052]  And they left us sit out there for an hour before they come out and got us to go and see it.
[00:10:34.052 --> 00:10:36.714]  I had to go back there and ask him, was he ready?
[00:10:36.714 --> 00:10:39.096]  And the nurse said, oh yeah, he's ready.
[00:10:39.096 --> 00:10:41.978]  And I said, why didn't you come tell us?
[00:10:41.978 --> 00:10:45.400]  You know, they're just so impersonal.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:51.385]  And I wish to God I would have took him out of there and put him in another hospital.
[00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:56.889]  Well, again, we're going to talk about the memorial fund for the grandchildren when we get back.
[00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:08.834]  Your son, during the break you told me, your son had told you that he believed it was the depleted uranium and then we talked about a lot of other people have already died from this with the exact same symptoms.
[00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:20.158]  Yes, with the high fever and the muscles and then the three that we heard about that died, as soon as they inulated them, put the tube down their throat, they died.
[00:11:20.158 --> 00:11:23.939]  And that's exactly what happened to him.
[00:11:23.939 --> 00:11:26.740]  As soon as they put the tube down his throat to ventilate him, he died.
[00:11:28.972 --> 00:11:30.273]  Unbelievable.
[00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.134]  And they know what DU does.
[00:11:32.134 --> 00:11:35.655]  They've known it since the 80s.
[00:11:35.655 --> 00:11:37.916]  And they still use it.
[00:11:37.916 --> 00:11:38.896]  And they don't care.
[00:11:38.896 --> 00:11:40.837]  And they're going to keep using it.
[00:11:40.837 --> 00:11:46.120]  And the people in Iraq are going to be dying for millions of years from it.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.561]  It never goes away.
[00:11:49.561 --> 00:11:50.662]  Stay there, Duane.
[00:11:50.662 --> 00:11:51.322]  We'll be right back.

[00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.464]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:14:00.464 --> 00:14:04.868]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:14:04.868 --> 00:14:05.729]  We listened.
[00:14:05.729 --> 00:14:10.993]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:14:10.993 --> 00:14:11.854]  We listened.
[00:14:11.854 --> 00:14:15.317]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:14:15.317 --> 00:14:16.318]  We listened.
[00:14:16.318 --> 00:14:19.701]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:20.281]  We're good to go.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.782]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[00:14:45.782 --> 00:14:51.127]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[00:14:51.127 --> 00:14:55.631]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[00:15:06.747 --> 00:15:09.348]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[00:15:09.348 --> 00:15:12.689]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[00:15:12.689 --> 00:15:14.830]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.091]  Is your life on hold to the spring?
[00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:18.151]  Check with your doctor.
[00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:23.533]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SADS, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[00:15:23.533 --> 00:15:28.896]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights.

[00:15:57.825 --> 00:16:00.806]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:16:00.806 --> 00:16:04.026]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16:04.026 --> 00:16:13.888]  I know it's hard for Mr. Garton, Dwayne Garton, father of Clay Garton, to be on with us.
[00:16:13.888 --> 00:16:19.129]  He's agreed to stay on with Dr. Rocky coming up with the next segment.
[00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:22.770]  We were talking again during the break, Dwayne, and you were talking about
[00:16:23.576 --> 00:16:29.022]  Friends that you have, the people who've come back who've lost 90 pounds.
[00:16:29.022 --> 00:16:31.124]  Tell us about that.
[00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:35.089]  Just the people that you know and that you've talked to of the troops coming back.
[00:16:35.089 --> 00:16:36.410]  I have family over there.
[00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.793]  They're all terrified of it.
[00:16:38.793 --> 00:16:41.496]  They say they've been told to keep their mouths shut.
[00:16:41.496 --> 00:16:44.279]  Almost all the big Iraqi bases were bombed with this.
[00:16:45.246 --> 00:16:59.131]  Uh, from the Warthogs and the F-18 Joint Strike Fighters and the Abrams and the Bradleys and then our troops move into those bases and the government is so confident that we won't be able to stand up against them, they just do it.
[00:16:59.131 --> 00:17:04.853]  Can you comment on the people you've talked to who have also been sick and dying from this and then what you think should happen in Iraq, sir?
[00:17:04.853 --> 00:17:06.794]  Yes, I'd be glad to.
[00:17:06.794 --> 00:17:09.615]  My daughter has a friend who
[00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:39.231]  A friend of hers was a mother and daughter that were over there the daughter came back and within I think they said within 34 days she lost 90 pounds and they don't expect her to live either so my son lost 30 pounds in 17 days in the hospital so this this has got to be something that they know
[00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:46.719]  And I know, even after they do this autopsy, they will not give me concrete evidence of what killed him.
[00:17:46.719 --> 00:17:49.521]  Well... And you know it as well as I do.
[00:17:49.521 --> 00:17:55.464]  Well, I would advise you, sir, to take multiple blood samples, tissue samples, and send it to multiple labs.
[00:17:55.464 --> 00:17:56.985]  It's a little late now.
[00:17:56.985 --> 00:18:00.527]  We're going to put him, bury him Monday.
[00:18:00.527 --> 00:18:07.692]  And, uh, they've already unbombed him, so... You know, it's a, it's, you know,
[00:18:08.527 --> 00:18:20.356]  A little late for some of the things but they took all these tissue samples that you're talking about and they were going to send them out and do an autopsy and they told us it would be six weeks before we would know any of the results.
[00:18:20.356 --> 00:18:20.876]  Where are they?
[00:18:20.876 --> 00:18:21.977]  Who is they?
[00:18:21.977 --> 00:18:23.358]  Where are they sending it?
[00:18:23.358 --> 00:18:29.122]  That KU Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas are the ones that took the tissue sample.
[00:18:29.122 --> 00:18:34.366]  They took the body from the VA hospital over to KU.
[00:18:34.366 --> 00:18:36.848]  Did you independently get this group or did they recommend them?
[00:18:38.264 --> 00:18:44.310]  KU doctors run the VA hospital here.
[00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:50.295]  Let me just tell you, the New York Daily News earlier this year tested the blood of 14 troops.
[00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:54.178]  They all had DU in them and upwards of two rims of radiation.
[00:18:54.178 --> 00:18:58.122]  But we've caught the government in the past, I don't know about this group, falsifying stuff.
[00:18:58.122 --> 00:18:59.603]  So I would definitely look out.
[00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:05.895]  And you know, how long did it take them to come up with the Asian orange that was killing our troops?
[00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:10.277]  And the other one in the Desert Storm was killing our troops.
[00:19:10.277 --> 00:19:14.218]  And now we've got another thing killing our troops and they're not telling us, you know?
[00:19:14.218 --> 00:19:19.439]  And they admit chemical weapons exposure from blowing up Tamashea.
[00:19:19.439 --> 00:19:20.099]  Yes.
[00:19:20.099 --> 00:19:20.679]  Yeah.
[00:19:20.679 --> 00:19:21.360]  Yeah.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.420]  But you know, my son was working.
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:29.942]  At one time, he was working in an airbase there in Iraq.
[00:19:31.059 --> 00:19:48.919]  uh... escorting twelve iraqi workers to rebuild this hangar and he said they were cleaning it out and there were canisters of everything and uh... storage rooms and everything and nobody knows what was in them and they were just carrying them out and you know getting rid of them
[00:19:49.665 --> 00:19:58.512]  So, you know, he can be exposed to something there, but if it's a germ warfare, the way I understand germ warfare when I was in the service... It'll happen pretty quick.
[00:19:58.512 --> 00:19:59.913]  Why would they want you to live six months?
[00:19:59.913 --> 00:20:02.114]  They want to get rid of you now because you're fighting them.
[00:20:02.114 --> 00:20:04.656]  Now, what happened to your son, Finch, the M.O.
[00:20:04.656 --> 00:20:07.639]  that I learned of eight, nine years ago, with the D.U.?
[00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:14.584]  Yeah, well, that's exactly what I think it was, because he was healthy up until the
[00:20:16.242 --> 00:20:17.503]  First of December.
[00:20:17.503 --> 00:20:20.105]  I mean, he's been back since May, you know.
[00:20:20.105 --> 00:20:22.266]  Well, sir, you own those tissue samples.
[00:20:22.266 --> 00:20:23.427]  I would demand those.
[00:20:23.427 --> 00:20:25.328]  This is my advice.
[00:20:25.328 --> 00:20:26.749]  You should sue him over this.
[00:20:26.749 --> 00:20:33.553]  I would demand those samples back if this is a VA-contracted group, and I'd have an independent lab do it like the New York Daily News did.
[00:20:33.553 --> 00:20:34.433]  I think you're right.
[00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:35.554]  I don't think I'll do that.
[00:20:35.554 --> 00:20:37.195]  I'd just show up there.
[00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:38.856]  I'd get a court order without him even knowing.
[00:20:38.856 --> 00:20:42.398]  Or he'd still know right now we're on in Kansas City.
[00:20:42.398 --> 00:20:43.679]  I'd get those samples back, sir.
[00:20:45.071 --> 00:20:46.812]  Yeah.
[00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:48.913]  If they haven't already gotten rid of them.
[00:20:48.913 --> 00:20:51.213]  I mean, I don't... I know what you're saying.
[00:20:51.213 --> 00:20:52.374]  I'm not impugning this group.
[00:20:52.374 --> 00:20:52.934]  I don't know.
[00:20:52.934 --> 00:21:03.438]  I'm just saying, if they're VA involved with the past stuff we've seen... Well, all their resident doctors are resident at the VA hospital over there.
[00:21:03.438 --> 00:21:05.719]  And all their main staff is from KU.
[00:21:05.719 --> 00:21:06.119]  Oh, boy.
[00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:09.401]  I mean, they're connected very tightly with the government.
[00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:12.402]  And if the government tells them, you keep your mouth shut, they're going to keep their mouth shut.
[00:21:12.978 --> 00:21:16.480]  Because they've got a contract there.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.842]  It's sad we've all got to think like this, but we do.
[00:21:18.842 --> 00:21:22.324]  You were saying during the break, you think we should pull everybody out of Iraq?
[00:21:22.324 --> 00:21:23.445]  Definitely.
[00:21:23.445 --> 00:21:25.606]  The quicker the better.
[00:21:25.606 --> 00:21:28.888]  They've been fighting for 2,000 years there.
[00:21:28.888 --> 00:21:36.353]  And as soon as we pull out of there, even after this election that he's so great about, they'll come in there and take it back away from them.
[00:21:36.353 --> 00:21:38.235]  Just like Saddam Hussein did.
[00:21:38.235 --> 00:21:40.796]  You can't stop that kind of stuff over there.
[00:21:40.796 --> 00:21:41.177]  You're right.
[00:21:41.177 --> 00:21:41.677]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:49.129]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:21:49.129 --> 00:21:51.833]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:57.296 --> 00:22:03.201]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:22:03.201 --> 00:22:07.665]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:22:07.665 --> 00:22:15.092]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:22:15.092 --> 00:22:21.338]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:22:21.338 --> 00:22:22.539]  There are no side effects.
[00:22:22.899 --> 00:22:25.984]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:22:25.984 --> 00:22:28.327]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:22:28.327 --> 00:22:35.857]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:22:35.857 --> 00:22:39.242]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:22:44.068 --> 00:22:44.328]  Call today.
[00:22:54.790 --> 00:23:01.173]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:23:01.173 --> 00:23:07.615]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has 8 LED lamps.
[00:23:07.615 --> 00:23:16.299]  Incredibly, the low energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:23.302]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:23:23.622 --> 00:23:28.665]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:23:28.665 --> 00:23:34.409]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:23:34.409 --> 00:23:37.812]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or night light.
[00:23:37.812 --> 00:23:45.837]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:23:54.863 --> 00:23:59.388]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[00:23:59.388 --> 00:24:06.736]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.
[00:24:06.736 --> 00:24:13.623]  Membership in the bear consists of a large and growing group of patriots who, like you, realize there are things in this great country that need changing right away.
[00:24:13.943 --> 00:24:21.826]  The Silver Bear Cafe provides you with an income opportunity that will provide you and your family with an ongoing revenue stream in return for simply spreading the message.
[00:24:21.826 --> 00:24:28.208]  So many of you have been trying to get the message out individually, but collectively our voices are strong and cannot be silenced.
[00:24:28.208 --> 00:24:30.849]  Membership in the bear will teach you the secrets of financial freedom.
[00:24:31.189 --> 00:24:33.390]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[00:25:02.261 --> 00:25:04.344]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:28.114]  We've now learned more details from Army Sergeant Clay Darden who died after 16 months in Iraq.
[00:25:28.114 --> 00:25:30.234]  He came back and died.
[00:25:30.234 --> 00:25:39.998]  We're going to air this one more time and at the end it has the phone number of the Bank of America to give some donations to help the widower and the three grandchildren because we really support the Cribs here.
[00:25:39.998 --> 00:25:43.699]  We're going to air this so Dr. Rocky has brought up the speed of this particular case.
[00:25:44.304 --> 00:25:52.299]  Then we're going to have Dr. Rocky and Dwayne Garten, the father of Army Specialist Clay Garten, on together.
[00:25:52.299 --> 00:25:56.186]  But one more time, here is this little NBC News piece.
[00:25:57.062 --> 00:26:03.044]  A soldier survives Iraq, but dies of a mysterious illness his family suspects the government is hiding.
[00:26:03.044 --> 00:26:07.665]  NBC Action News reporter Ron Mott is live with the story you'll see only on NBC Action News.
[00:26:07.665 --> 00:26:08.225]  Ron?
[00:26:08.225 --> 00:26:13.887]  Elizabeth, it's a complaint heard all over the country that soldiers are being poisoned by their own ammo.
[00:26:13.887 --> 00:26:20.269]  They, of course, are made to kill the enemy, but as one Raytown family says, they've turned into unfriendly fire.
[00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:23.330]  You know, they come out five minutes and said, he's gone.
[00:26:27.983 --> 00:26:33.224]  For nearly a year and a half, Dwayne Garton worried that his son might return from Iraq in a body bag.
[00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:35.685]  This is worse than they could have got killed over here, really?
[00:26:35.685 --> 00:26:46.429]  Instead, decorated 35-year-old Army Sergeant Clay Garton spent an agonizing three weeks dying in his parents' Raytown home and at the VA hospital, eventually losing the fight the day after Christmas.
[00:26:46.429 --> 00:26:48.089]  25 years, I had no boy.
[00:26:51.098 --> 00:26:56.482]  He went through 16 months of hell, and he came back, and they didn't do nothing for him.
[00:26:56.482 --> 00:27:00.506]  That's what I don't understand, why they couldn't do something for him.
[00:27:00.506 --> 00:27:03.648]  This is Seth, and this is Mr. Gage.
[00:27:03.648 --> 00:27:14.377]  A father of three, Clay Garten's family believes the Army medic is every bit a casualty of war as those who die on the front lines, after they say he became exposed to depleted uranium dust used in some U.S.
[00:27:14.377 --> 00:27:15.278]  ammunition.
[00:27:15.278 --> 00:27:18.100]  The government contends the health risks are low.
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.062]  I think they know exactly what's going on.
[00:27:21.685 --> 00:27:25.608]  I think these troops over there are all in danger of this stuff.
[00:27:25.608 --> 00:27:36.116]  The family says Garten lost 30 pounds before he died starting with a debilitating back spasm earlier this month that was followed by a series of high fevers reaching 106 degrees.
[00:27:36.116 --> 00:27:45.983]  It was hard to watch my son from such a big strong intelligent man to turn into a small
[00:27:47.878 --> 00:27:51.981]  Meanwhile, a grieving father mourns his lost fishing and hunting buddy.
[00:27:51.981 --> 00:27:54.322]  That's the only way I can remember him.
[00:27:54.322 --> 00:27:56.404]  I don't want to remember this.
[00:27:56.404 --> 00:27:58.746]  This is too painful.
[00:27:58.746 --> 00:28:01.788]  If you were in my body right now, you'd know how hard it hurts.
[00:28:03.163 --> 00:28:07.005]  A memorial fund has been set up in Clay Garton's name to benefit his three kids.
[00:28:07.005 --> 00:28:13.487]  For more information, call the Bank of America Raytown branch at 816-979-6292.
[00:28:13.487 --> 00:28:19.630]  And the family did have tissue samples taken from Clay Garton's body, hoping that they will lead to some concrete answers.
[00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.870]  Reporting live tonight, Ron Mott, NBC.
[00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:23.431]  I talked to Dr. Rockey during the break.
[00:28:23.431 --> 00:28:25.892]  We're about to go to him and Mr. Gartner.
[00:28:25.892 --> 00:28:27.313]  Garton.
[00:28:27.313 --> 00:28:30.434]  And he said, definitely get those samples back.
[00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:38.471]  Until it turns into something where they say, oh, false positive, and then you don't want to exhume or anything.
[00:28:38.471 --> 00:28:48.374]  Again, New York Daily News and others did blood tests on troops from massive levels of radiation, upwards of two rims, the heavy metal effects, all of it.
[00:28:48.374 --> 00:28:53.955]  And understand, folks, I have copies of the Army Manual that Dr. Rocky helped write.
[00:28:53.955 --> 00:28:59.376]  I've seen online hours of the seven-hour training video they're supposed to watch.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:10.663]  This was to be a frontline weapon to fight the Soviet Union if they poured across Europe with their 6-1 superiority of armor.
[00:29:10.663 --> 00:29:16.886]  This was to be a frontline emergency weapon during a nuclear war to just go ahead and knock out their tanks.
[00:29:16.886 --> 00:29:20.807]  Instead they've used it in the first Gulf War, second Gulf War, Serbia,
[00:29:21.724 --> 00:29:25.665]  From Kosovo, to Belgrade, and of course in Afghanistan.
[00:29:25.665 --> 00:29:27.685]  This is nuclear war.
[00:29:27.685 --> 00:29:31.666]  And it doesn't go away for hundreds of millions of years.
[00:29:31.666 --> 00:29:34.767]  Basically forever, as far as humanity is concerned.
[00:29:34.767 --> 00:29:36.748]  I mean, they may have salted the earth.
[00:29:36.748 --> 00:29:39.328]  The Romans used to salt the earth to punish people.
[00:29:39.328 --> 00:29:42.309]  Now they salt it with DU.
[00:29:42.309 --> 00:29:45.050]  And Dr. Rocky helped write the book on this stuff.
[00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.850]  He went over there to study it, helped remove damaged vehicles.
[00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:49.391]  The first Gulf War, he's been very ill.
[00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:50.471]  A lot of his team has died.
[00:29:51.366 --> 00:29:58.129]  Just to fill you in on this, and why does Donald Rumsfeld, this government, Bill Clinton, all of them, they don't care!
[00:29:58.129 --> 00:30:03.751]  And to examine this psychology and to go over the facts with us is Dr. Rocky.
[00:30:03.751 --> 00:30:07.973]  Dr. Rocky, just in a nutshell, tell us your incredible bio,
[00:30:08.732 --> 00:30:26.026]  And then what DU is, and what the effects are, what the science is, what the Pentagon's own manuals show, and then I want to get into the psychology of why they're using it and don't care, and then we'll be talking in a minute or so here to Mr. Garten, father of Clay Garten.
[00:30:26.026 --> 00:30:27.687]  Dr. Rocky, thanks for joining us.
[00:30:27.687 --> 00:30:31.870]  Thank you, and first my condolences to the father and the family.
[00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:36.274]  You know, another warrior has fallen and is totally unnecessary and unacceptable.
[00:30:37.062 --> 00:30:56.811]  Well, my background in the military goes back to 1967, Vietnam time, a few years over there in that area, and going through, coming back in as a combat medic, three years in the infantry, and moving on up through the ranks, starting out from the enlisted and going up through the officer ranks, so I've held all the ranks in different positions in the military.
[00:30:57.922 --> 00:31:07.989]  When Gulf War One started, my expertise and my team's expertise, and I'm just a member of the team, we were under senior colonels that, again, were the leaders of our team.
[00:31:07.989 --> 00:31:19.697]  Our expertise was nuclear, biological, chemical warfare, preventive medicine, hazardous materials, and then, obviously, with the completion of the ground war, we got tossed in the whole depleted uranium mess.
[00:31:19.697 --> 00:31:27.362]  In late February after the ground war, February, March of 1991, General Schwarzkopf specifically assigned me
[00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:32.042]  As he was ordered by the Pentagon to go out and clean up the DU mess.
[00:31:32.042 --> 00:31:34.304]  And ever since, it's been a nightmare.
[00:31:34.304 --> 00:31:36.666]  Highway of Hell and other areas.
[00:31:36.666 --> 00:31:37.466]  Yeah.
[00:31:37.466 --> 00:31:42.390]  Well, let's go back though, because before that, you actually worked at the laboratories.
[00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.052]  You studied DU, correct?
[00:31:44.052 --> 00:31:44.552]  Well, no.
[00:31:44.552 --> 00:31:49.096]  I basically didn't know a whole lot about DU other than my background in physics and everything else.
[00:31:49.096 --> 00:31:53.099]  And at the time this all started, I was in high energy physics at the University of Illinois.
[00:31:53.573 --> 00:31:55.734]  When did you write the reports on DU?
[00:31:55.734 --> 00:32:03.980]  Well, we wrote the reports on DU once we got up there and started cleaning up the mess and finding out the problems and all of us started getting sick within 24 to 72 hours.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.340]  We went up there and found people sick.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.803]  We started getting sick and our first cancers on our team started within nine months.
[00:32:09.803 --> 00:32:12.205]  The first cancer deaths within two years.
[00:32:12.205 --> 00:32:14.686]  All the other health effects started showing up.
[00:32:14.686 --> 00:32:22.391]  The thing that's important about this, and this is one of the things that I've been yelling and screaming and the rest of our team has been yelling and screaming at the top of our lungs, you need to understand.
[00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.273]  We're all medical, senior scientists, Army professionals.
[00:32:26.273 --> 00:32:32.158]  We're Army leaders that became persona non grata when we spoke about this stuff.
[00:32:32.158 --> 00:32:47.211]  What happened in Gulf War I and what we're seeing the same in Gulf War II is not only do we have all the uranium contamination, but we destroyed a nation and released all the toxic industrial chemicals that are used in agriculture, industry, medicine, and education.
[00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:49.473]  We sent the troops in there without the adequate training.
[00:32:50.154 --> 00:32:51.817]  Without the adequate equipment.
[00:32:51.817 --> 00:32:59.830]  I mean, the United States General Accounting Office had confirmed before the report that the gas masks and the mop suits ever issued to the troops were defective and faulty.
[00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.835]  That's an absolute simple fact of life.
[00:33:02.835 --> 00:33:04.698]  The kids did not know how to use this stuff.
[00:33:05.393 --> 00:33:13.098]  They were not given the training that's mandated, and I think it's important to understand the DU training that I put together for the Army.
[00:33:13.098 --> 00:33:25.906]  Yeah, let's go back over that, and then even previous to that, the Pentagon and the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories and others, they had admitted that DU was really bad, but they kept this quiet.
[00:33:25.906 --> 00:33:27.847]  Can you talk about that a little bit?
[00:33:27.847 --> 00:33:34.051]  Yeah, I mean, we can go back as far as the reports that were compiled after we gave it to Israel to use it against the
[00:33:35.322 --> 00:33:38.324]  Egyptians in the Sinai in 73 and 74.
[00:33:38.324 --> 00:33:41.646]  That confirmed all the health effects and the environmental problems.
[00:33:41.646 --> 00:33:49.671]  The work that we put together, coming back when I got what's called the infamous Groves Memorandum, goes back to 1943.
[00:33:49.671 --> 00:33:58.637]  And we've talked to individuals that were present, were involved in writing this stuff, that uranium was going to cause all these health effects once it's inhaled, digested, or get into the body.
[00:33:58.637 --> 00:34:01.879]  And when you combine the uranium contamination from the use of the weapons,
[00:34:02.731 --> 00:34:05.292]  Plus all of the other contaminants from war.
[00:34:05.292 --> 00:34:07.754]  You've got an absolute toxic nightmare.
[00:34:07.754 --> 00:34:10.035]  And that's why, and according to the U.S.
[00:34:10.035 --> 00:34:22.562]  Department of Veterans Affairs, they're totally acknowledging that of all individuals served in the Persian Gulf, from say August of 1990, and the latest reports I've got are, you know, May of this year, this last year.
[00:34:22.562 --> 00:34:26.024]  Well, yeah, we're still in 2004, aren't we?
[00:34:26.024 --> 00:34:27.505]  We're looking at well over 260,000.
[00:34:29.946 --> 00:34:30.907]  For our sons and daughters.
[00:34:30.907 --> 00:34:34.332]  That's over 30% of the forces already been labeled disabled.
[00:34:34.332 --> 00:34:35.773]  We're seeing neurological problems.
[00:34:35.773 --> 00:34:37.015]  We're seeing respiratory problems.
[00:34:37.015 --> 00:34:37.996]  We're seeing cancers.
[00:34:37.996 --> 00:34:38.777]  We got malignants.
[00:34:38.777 --> 00:34:40.760]  We got non-malignant tumors.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.842]  We have all the neurological symptoms.
[00:34:42.842 --> 00:34:44.985]  We have the whole host of all of this stuff.
[00:34:45.592 --> 00:34:46.833]  It's put together.
[00:34:46.833 --> 00:34:52.859]  And then earlier this year the New York paper went and did blood tests and wow they had high levels of DU in them!
[00:34:52.859 --> 00:35:12.636]  Well absolutely and that's as members of the 442nd New York National Guard you have to understand these were the heroes of 9-1-1 these are the police and firemen that survived that tragedy on that day were put on active duty and sent to war with defective equipment with totally inadequate training
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.362]  Into a contaminated area where the leaders had not complied with the U.S.
[00:35:17.362 --> 00:35:18.302]  Army regulations.
[00:35:18.302 --> 00:35:19.883]  They had not complied with the orders.
[00:35:19.883 --> 00:35:20.644]  Now there's no debate.
[00:35:20.644 --> 00:35:21.804]  They've tested their blood.
[00:35:21.804 --> 00:35:23.965]  They all had incredibly high levels.
[00:35:23.965 --> 00:35:25.206]  You have the radiation problem.
[00:35:25.206 --> 00:35:27.887]  You have the heavy metal problem, as we talked last time.
[00:35:27.887 --> 00:35:33.230]  Doctor, and the point I want to make here is we used a lot more DU this time than last time.
[00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.050]  Can you speak to that?
[00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:35.871]  Then I want to go to Mr. Garten.
[00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:39.513]  Yeah, we're looking at the estimates during Gulf War I. We probably used 375 tons.
[00:35:39.513 --> 00:35:39.873]  And I mean 375 tons.
[00:35:42.914 --> 00:35:44.435]  A solid uranium.
[00:35:44.435 --> 00:35:48.158]  Not 375 tons of munitions contained in everything.
[00:35:48.158 --> 00:35:51.922]  But 375 tons comprised of solid uranium.
[00:35:51.922 --> 00:35:57.886]  And in this time, we're looking in Iraq in Gulf War II, or Operation Iraqi Freedom.
[00:35:57.886 --> 00:36:02.610]  The only freedom here is the freedom to get polluted and die.
[00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.091]  Probably over a thousand tons.
[00:36:04.091 --> 00:36:06.693]  So we're looking at three times the amount.
[00:36:06.693 --> 00:36:08.395]  And the thing that's disturbing me
[00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:09.491]  Most.
[00:36:09.491 --> 00:36:25.996]  The United States Army Surgeon General, General Ronald Peek, specifically ordered, and again he's reiterating all the orders we go back to to my original one right after the ground war in 91, to provide immediate radio bioassays, immediate medical care for all individuals who have been exposed.
[00:36:25.996 --> 00:36:38.140]  In the case of 442nd, the US Army absolutely refused to comply with the existing orders, forcing the individuals at the New York Daily News to take it upon themselves, acquire the funding to set up the testing.
[00:36:39.085 --> 00:36:44.072]  So that order requiring medical care for all of our sons and daughters is absolutely not being complied with.
[00:36:44.072 --> 00:36:51.902]  Okay, let me bring Mr. Garten on, father of Clay Garten, 36 year old who came back and died within a month once he got sick.
[00:36:52.786 --> 00:36:54.287]  After his death, the
[00:37:15.395 --> 00:37:23.342]  They wanted to do an autopsy and I told them they were going to do a massive autopsy and cut my son up and he was worse, making me worse than he was.
[00:37:23.342 --> 00:37:31.469]  And then they came back later and asked if they could do tissue samples without doing any, you know, big cutting of the body.
[00:37:31.469 --> 00:37:33.411]  And that way they could absolve, but go ahead.
[00:37:33.411 --> 00:37:33.751]  Right.
[00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:41.538]  They can take little small tissue samples by drilling a little hole in the head and taking the samples and the lungs and the liver and the heart and all that stuff.
[00:37:42.566 --> 00:37:55.673]  And then they said that they were going to take these samples over to KU and then send them out and get these tests done on them and then we would know in six weeks, you know, what the problem was.
[00:37:55.673 --> 00:37:59.355]  And then again, tell folks the relationship between KU and the VA there.
[00:37:59.355 --> 00:38:11.942]  Well, the VA, all the interns are members of KU Medical Center and all the head doctors over there are from KU Medical Center that work there like once a week or something like that or once a month.
[00:38:12.984 --> 00:38:18.528]  And it's all run by KU, the Veterans Hospital is more or less.
[00:38:18.528 --> 00:38:25.432]  And they went and done a bone marrow tap on my son in the last week that he was there.
[00:38:25.432 --> 00:38:30.735]  And they came back, they said, no, he don't have no uranium poisoning.
[00:38:30.735 --> 00:38:32.697]  It's all that shows is arthritis.
[00:38:34.389 --> 00:38:36.292]  To me, I don't think they were telling us the truth.
[00:38:36.292 --> 00:38:43.004]  Well, I mean, they said that the National Guard in New York didn't have it, and then boom, New York Daily News did it, and they hit massive levels.
[00:38:43.004 --> 00:38:45.268]  Dr. Rocky, what would you do about this?
[00:38:45.268 --> 00:38:46.249]  Well, you've got to mess it.
[00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:50.893]  First off, sir, my condolences to you and your family.
[00:38:50.893 --> 00:38:52.814]  Thank you very much.
[00:38:52.814 --> 00:39:00.159]  Warriors have been sent to war with defective equipment, inadequate training, and total lack of medical support ever since I came into the military in 1967.
[00:39:00.159 --> 00:39:02.401]  I was in there in the fifties.
[00:39:02.401 --> 00:39:04.862]  I was in the United States Navy.
[00:39:04.862 --> 00:39:07.584]  Well, my father was also in the Navy.
[00:39:07.584 --> 00:39:09.485]  So families come both ways.
[00:39:14.404 --> 00:39:17.927]  For the exposure to depleted uranium and these other toxins.
[00:39:17.927 --> 00:39:27.033]  With DU they needed to do what's called a radio bioassay and that's where they collect the urine of feces samples and do a nasal and pharyngeal swab to determine what the exposures are.
[00:39:27.033 --> 00:39:30.936]  That's supposed to happen within 24 to 72 hours of your exposure.
[00:39:30.936 --> 00:39:32.137]  So they can't get that done?
[00:39:32.137 --> 00:39:32.938]  Well obviously not.
[00:39:32.938 --> 00:39:33.878]  They're not going to comply.
[00:39:33.878 --> 00:39:37.361]  That is the written orders but they are absolutely refusing to comply with that.
[00:39:37.361 --> 00:39:43.125]  Not only for our own sons and daughters but for also everybody else that's exposed and that's Iraqi children,
[00:39:43.815 --> 00:39:48.899]  Afghan children, the Balkan children, and it goes all over the United States, whether it's Concord, Massachusetts.
[00:39:48.899 --> 00:39:51.081]  Yeah, ten different testing grounds, correct?
[00:39:51.081 --> 00:39:53.002]  Yeah, a whole bunch of different places.
[00:39:53.002 --> 00:39:55.004]  It's an absolute disaster.
[00:39:55.004 --> 00:40:01.849]  And so, when they do the tissue samples, now, they did the tissue sample biopsy on me, and I still got the scar on my arm, and I'm looking at it right now.
[00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:03.931]  Totally useless.
[00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:04.431]  Okay?
[00:40:04.431 --> 00:40:04.891]  Yeah.
[00:40:04.891 --> 00:40:07.653]  I mean, they're blowing smoke.
[00:40:07.653 --> 00:40:08.134]  That's what I, you know,
[00:40:10.725 --> 00:40:13.587]  I said, should I take him somewhere else?
[00:40:13.587 --> 00:40:16.529]  Should I take him to another hospital?
[00:40:16.529 --> 00:40:18.971]  Oh no!
[00:40:18.971 --> 00:40:22.573]  You know, no matter where you take them, they'll do the same test we are.
[00:40:22.573 --> 00:40:28.197]  They said we've run every test culture of any disease in Iraq.
[00:40:28.197 --> 00:40:29.178]  Well, it ain't a disease.
[00:40:29.178 --> 00:40:31.479]  It's not a disease.
[00:40:31.479 --> 00:40:31.699]  Huh?
[00:40:31.699 --> 00:40:32.500]  It's not a disease.
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.020]  That's right.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.341]  What we're looking at is
[00:40:38.306 --> 00:40:40.967]  This is one of the things we've been arguing about for so long.
[00:40:40.967 --> 00:40:44.508]  War has become a toxic wasteland.
[00:40:44.508 --> 00:40:49.930]  We absolutely use the uranium munitions and they are an illegal weapon according to the United Nations.
[00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:53.412]  And when you look at the criteria, I mean the common task training for the U.S.
[00:40:53.412 --> 00:41:01.475]  soldiers, and again I wrote this, very simply requires full respiratory and skin protection immediately upon exposure.
[00:41:02.091 --> 00:41:03.671]  It requires immediate medical care.
[00:41:03.671 --> 00:41:04.792]  Yeah, that's the book he wrote.
[00:41:04.792 --> 00:41:05.612]  Tell us about that.
[00:41:05.612 --> 00:41:06.932]  Yeah, well, there's a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:41:06.932 --> 00:41:07.492]  Let me finish.
[00:41:07.492 --> 00:41:13.034]  And then also say specifically that uranium contaminations can make food and water unusable.
[00:41:13.034 --> 00:41:14.234]  So we've got all of this stuff.
[00:41:14.234 --> 00:41:17.195]  Now, what happened, and I understand your son was a medic, sir?
[00:41:17.195 --> 00:41:18.255]  Yes, he was a vet medic.
[00:41:18.255 --> 00:41:19.655]  A helicopter corpsman.
[00:41:19.655 --> 00:41:23.956]  He was inside an armored vehicle that had been hit by DU shells.
[00:41:23.956 --> 00:41:25.517]  Friendly fire.
[00:41:25.517 --> 00:41:29.217]  Well, no, it was enemy fire, but they had... He climbed all over it.
[00:41:29.217 --> 00:41:31.378]  He went inside of it to...
[00:41:32.495 --> 00:41:39.138]  Take care of the gentleman that got his arm blew off by... I'm sure you know, Dr. Rockey, that the Iraqis have got DU.
[00:41:39.138 --> 00:41:40.859]  They've been shooting the Abrams up with it.
[00:41:40.859 --> 00:41:41.839]  Oh, no.
[00:41:41.839 --> 00:41:44.601]  First off, the Iraqis have never had DU.
[00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:48.683]  The United States and Great Britain and Australia and Canada are the only ones that have it.
[00:41:48.683 --> 00:41:51.444]  But it's been reported that someone's shooting through the Abrams with DU.
[00:41:51.444 --> 00:41:52.264]  Well, absolutely.
[00:41:52.264 --> 00:41:53.325]  We are.
[00:41:53.325 --> 00:41:55.346]  They shot through this armored personnel carrier.
[00:41:55.626 --> 00:41:57.087]  Friendly fire.
[00:41:57.087 --> 00:41:58.989]  It wasn't friendly fire.
[00:41:58.989 --> 00:42:01.691]  He believes, his son believes, correct?
[00:42:01.691 --> 00:42:02.011]  Yes.
[00:42:02.011 --> 00:42:05.634]  Mr. Garten, that they had captured weapons?
[00:42:05.634 --> 00:42:12.720]  From what he said, the attack on this column, when they shot the shell through there, was from Iraqis.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.462]  Now, the only thing that's going to happen is the U.S.
[00:42:15.462 --> 00:42:22.167]  has been shooting up everything and everything that moves, whether it's a building, it's a water treatment facility, whether it's food storage, or it's our own.
[00:42:22.167 --> 00:42:23.929]  I mean, we have an Abrams tank that was lost
[00:42:25.249 --> 00:42:28.131]  In August, August 28th, you know, over a year ago.
[00:42:28.131 --> 00:42:28.231]  Yeah.
[00:42:28.231 --> 00:42:30.372]  That was all friendly fire from 50 Cal.
[00:42:30.372 --> 00:42:30.632]  Yeah.
[00:42:30.632 --> 00:42:32.694]  So what we have is the U.S.
[00:42:32.694 --> 00:42:35.115]  shooting everything that moves with uranium munitions.
[00:42:35.115 --> 00:42:39.418]  As a consequence, the medics have to go and provide care or take care of the people that come out.
[00:42:39.418 --> 00:42:41.799]  And they're not having adequate respiratory skin protection.
[00:42:41.799 --> 00:42:46.402]  And once they're exposed, they're not providing them the immediate medical care or the testing that are needed to confirm this.
[00:42:46.402 --> 00:42:48.903]  Alright, stay there Dr. Rockey and Mr. Garten.
[00:42:48.903 --> 00:42:50.144]  We'll talk about this when we get back.
[00:42:50.144 --> 00:42:51.185]  It's very, very important.
[00:42:52.145 --> 00:42:54.887]  Mass poisoning would be you!
[00:42:54.887 --> 00:42:59.409]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:42:59.409 --> 00:43:03.972]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:43:03.972 --> 00:43:08.395]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:43:08.395 --> 00:43:09.756]  The New World Order.
[00:43:11.537 --> 00:43:15.818]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:43:15.818 --> 00:43:22.881]  We've ripped the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:43:22.881 --> 00:43:25.242]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:43:25.242 --> 00:43:35.886]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:43:35.886 --> 00:43:38.467]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my
[00:43:38.527 --> 00:43:38.787]  That's 888-253-3139
[00:43:54.250 --> 00:44:02.034]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:44:02.034 --> 00:44:12.940]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.302]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:44:15.302 --> 00:44:18.944]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:44:18.944 --> 00:44:29.712]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:44:29.712 --> 00:44:30.392]  That's right!
[00:44:30.392 --> 00:44:37.477]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:44:37.777 --> 00:44:42.063]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:44:42.063 --> 00:44:46.588]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:44:46.588 --> 00:44:47.249]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:44:56.033 --> 00:44:56.354]  I think so.
[00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:11.916]  We're good to go!

[00:45:40.799 --> 00:45:44.040]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:49.902]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:46:00.084 --> 00:46:04.988]  Bottom line, they know the EU is deadly, both as a heavy metal and with the radiation.
[00:46:04.988 --> 00:46:09.650]  And a thousand tons!
[00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:12.152]  Three times what was used in the first Gulf War.
[00:46:12.152 --> 00:46:16.475]  They used masses of it in Serbia as well and Afghanistan.
[00:46:16.475 --> 00:46:18.976]  Doesn't go away for hundreds of millions of years.
[00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:19.857]  That's just the half-life.
[00:46:21.568 --> 00:46:23.789]  Dr. Rocky is going to be with us into the next hour.
[00:46:23.789 --> 00:46:28.891]  We have had Mr. Garten on with us and he's welcome to keep riding the shotgun with us if he'd like to.
[00:46:28.891 --> 00:46:36.714]  I want to give out the number for the Memorial Fund to help out Mr. Garten's children, Clay Garten who died.
[00:46:36.714 --> 00:46:42.397]  But Dr. Rocky, I wanted to bring this point up to you.
[00:46:43.351 --> 00:46:56.734]  They admit that most of the Republican Guard and Iraqi regular army bases got bombed with DU, then our troops moved right into those bases, and in a few bases they brought in dump trucks with sand to dump it over the blast points.
[00:46:56.734 --> 00:47:00.495]  Does that protect our troops, dumping some sand on the DU?
[00:47:00.495 --> 00:47:01.615]  Absolutely not.
[00:47:01.615 --> 00:47:05.816]  It's not compliant whatsoever with the existing regulations.
[00:47:06.405 --> 00:47:06.685]  U.S.
[00:47:06.685 --> 00:47:10.748]  Army regulation, I understand you've got a link to it on your website?
[00:47:10.748 --> 00:47:12.489]  Yes, at Infowars.com.
[00:47:12.489 --> 00:47:13.309]  Okay.
[00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:19.633]  Very specifically requires that the U.S.
[00:47:19.633 --> 00:47:29.559]  Army identify, isolate, secure, and clean up all of this contamination.
[00:47:29.559 --> 00:47:34.422]  I mean, it's not a question, it's not a debate, it's not a discussion.
[00:47:35.051 --> 00:47:40.935]  The order was signed by General Eric Shinseki, mandating this compliance.
[00:47:40.935 --> 00:47:42.997]  And again, they just simply refuse.
[00:47:42.997 --> 00:47:45.238]  Let me add something else to this.
[00:47:45.238 --> 00:47:47.640]  The Abrams uses DU in its armor.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:54.204]  I've also read that even when people use non-DU weapons against the Abrams, it puts off DU.
[00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:55.465]  Is that accurate?
[00:47:55.465 --> 00:47:55.986]  No.
[00:47:55.986 --> 00:47:56.686]  No, not really.
[00:47:56.686 --> 00:47:59.388]  What you have is the Abrams tank does have DU components.
[00:48:00.503 --> 00:48:03.765]  If those things are penetrated or you have any problem, you'll have a portion.
[00:48:03.765 --> 00:48:24.439]  But the main problem is with the Abrams and everything, and the Bradley, they have such an upload of DU munitions on board, that if you get hit by friendly fire, which is what happened during Gulf War I, because the majority of the deaths and wounds were friendly fire from DU during Gulf War I, what you have is the release of not only what was shot at it, but you have the release of what was on board.
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:33.103]  Now in the Iraqi equivalent, one thing that we verified as part of the captured equipment project, that thing is chock full of radioactive materials on its own.
[00:48:33.103 --> 00:48:48.608]  Okay, so you have those things released during the detonation that are inherent components of the Iraqi equipment, or the Soviet equipment, whether it's the BMP, that's the armored personnel carrier that his son went in to treat the guy, or any of the tanks, or anything else.
[00:48:48.608 --> 00:48:50.289]  And so you have all this combination.
[00:48:50.802 --> 00:48:56.546]  The other thing that's important to understand is not only do you have uranium munitions, you don't just have a pile of solid radioactive dust.
[00:48:56.546 --> 00:49:00.989]  You've got all the other contaminants that are all mixed together.
[00:49:00.989 --> 00:49:04.252]  And so what this is is a synergistic toxic wasteland.
[00:49:04.252 --> 00:49:06.133]  Alright, let me give out the nump.
[00:49:06.133 --> 00:49:12.177]  Mr. Garten, I appreciate you having the courage to come on the broadcast and I'm so sorry about your son.
[00:49:12.177 --> 00:49:15.820]  But how do people contribute to help out your grandchildren?
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.121]  They can make a donation to the Bank of America
[00:49:19.961 --> 00:49:36.754]  The order of Clay W. Garten, and that's in Raytown, Missouri, and the address there is 10100 East 350 Highway, Raytown, Missouri, at 64138 Zip.
[00:49:36.754 --> 00:49:39.696]  The phone number is area code 816-979-6294.
[00:49:44.804 --> 00:49:55.833]  And we appreciate anything that anybody can do and we appreciate you giving us the opportunity to discuss our pain and misery and our feelings of what's been going on.
[00:49:55.833 --> 00:50:07.081]  And the gentleman that's on the air with you, I hope you have a good fight and we can all do this together and get this stuff stopped because we should not be killing our own people.
[00:50:07.081 --> 00:50:11.905]  And you know, we had a civil war here many hundred years ago and we don't need it anymore.
[00:50:13.519 --> 00:50:17.041]  I want to just keep you a few more minutes on the other side and then we'll let you go, Mr. Garten.
[00:50:17.041 --> 00:50:23.466]  But I want to ask you and Mr. Rockey both, when we get back, why the establishment doesn't care about the troops.
[00:50:23.466 --> 00:50:24.827]  You know, the psychology of this.
[00:50:24.827 --> 00:50:25.568]  Because they know.
[00:50:25.568 --> 00:50:28.390]  So just do a few more minutes with us, Mr. Garten, and we'll let you go.
[00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:34.074]  And we'll continue then with Dr. Rockey to get into more detail about DU and how to stop this.
[00:50:34.074 --> 00:50:36.116]  We're going to break for 70 seconds.
[00:50:36.116 --> 00:50:37.337]  Come back with a third hour.
[00:50:38.112 --> 00:50:49.457]  Finish up with Mr. Garten and then continue with Mr. Rocky and type your calls at ballwars.com.
[00:50:49.457 --> 00:50:50.778]  Big Brother.
[00:50:50.778 --> 00:50:52.539]  Mainstream media.
[00:50:52.539 --> 00:50:53.679]  Government cover-ups.
[00:50:53.679 --> 00:50:55.860]  You want answers?
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.801]  Well, so does he.
[00:50:56.801 --> 00:51:01.623]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:01.623 --> 00:51:05.685]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:51:08.004 --> 00:51:20.051]  For the last hour, we've had the father of Army Sergeant Clay Garton, who clearly was exposed to GU and believes that he was sick from it and he died.
[00:51:20.051 --> 00:51:25.373]  Many others have been mentally contaminated and have been sick and have died.
[00:51:25.373 --> 00:51:26.354]  And our government doesn't care.
[00:51:26.354 --> 00:51:31.537]  They're going to keep using it, using even more of it, and then just not giving the people treatment and denying that it ever happened.
[00:51:31.537 --> 00:51:36.239]  Dr. Doug Rockey wrote literally the book on this after he was there in the 1990s in Iraq.
[00:51:38.254 --> 00:51:39.735]  Or General Schwarzkopf.
[00:51:39.735 --> 00:51:40.555]  He's become ill.
[00:51:40.555 --> 00:51:43.977]  Many members of his team have died from it.
[00:51:43.977 --> 00:51:46.738]  And we're going to let Mr. Garten go here in just a few minutes.
[00:51:46.738 --> 00:51:49.459]  And we'll continue with Mr. Rockey, Dr. Rockey.
[00:51:49.459 --> 00:51:55.182]  But Clay and Dr. Rockey, both of you, in the few minutes we've got left here in this segment.
[00:51:55.182 --> 00:51:59.684]  Rumsfeld, Bush, Clinton, all these people know what this does.
[00:51:59.684 --> 00:52:01.065]  The Army's own
[00:52:02.156 --> 00:52:07.477]  Documents, as you said, going back to the 70s and 80s, know how toxic and deadly this is.
[00:52:07.477 --> 00:52:10.898]  And there's other contaminants, not just DU, in these DU rounds.
[00:52:10.898 --> 00:52:12.298]  Why don't they care?
[00:52:12.298 --> 00:52:15.739]  Why do they bomb bases and then send our troops in to breathe it?
[00:52:15.739 --> 00:52:19.060]  Dr. Rockey and then Mr. Garten.
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:20.620]  Well, it's very easy.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:23.520]  The purpose of war is to kill and destroy.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:26.821]  The consequences of war are totally irrelevant.
[00:52:26.821 --> 00:52:30.722]  President Bush, ex-President Clinton, ex-President Bush number one,
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:35.703]  For anybody going back as far as I can remember, down back to the 60s.
[00:52:35.703 --> 00:52:38.285]  The purpose is to kill and destroy.
[00:52:38.285 --> 00:52:48.453]  And when you send a warrior, as we'll say, charge a machine gun at us, that warrior goes in there with an attitude that first I'm immune, I'm Superman, nothing can happen to me.
[00:52:48.453 --> 00:52:54.537]  But then when it happens, they absolutely just totally disregard the health and environmental effects.
[00:52:54.537 --> 00:52:59.141]  In March of 1991, and again you have a reference to this, I think you're linked to it,
[00:52:59.736 --> 00:53:05.778]  I received a memorandum from the Los Alamos National Labs called the Payne-Los Alamos Memo.
[00:53:05.778 --> 00:53:15.601]  It was written by Colonel Michael Zeme, very specifically stated that we should rely on our reports in order to sustain the use of uranium missions because they're so effective in combat.
[00:53:15.601 --> 00:53:18.782]  The combat commander does not care
[00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:22.753]  And the generals and the president don't care what happens to the troops.
[00:53:22.753 --> 00:53:27.378]  Well that's like saying let's drop neutron bombs on our troops because it will kill the enemy too.
[00:53:27.378 --> 00:53:29.220]  Well yeah, really that's about it.
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.222]  I mean that's what's happened.
[00:53:30.222 --> 00:53:36.128]  Well in my opinion they should have just nuked the whole country and not even send our troops in and we would have wasted them all.
[00:53:36.128 --> 00:53:38.611]  Instead of doing it slowly we would have killed them all at once.
[00:53:39.048 --> 00:53:44.389]  Well, you know, sir, there's one of the things, and we have to go to this, and I was involved in the planning of this.
[00:53:44.389 --> 00:53:54.772]  I mean, Gulf War II, Operation Iraqi Freedom, was totally ready to go by the summer of 2000, and then when Gore didn't get elected, the Kibosh got put on that invasion.
[00:53:54.772 --> 00:53:57.992]  Iraq posed absolutely no threat to the United States.
[00:53:57.992 --> 00:54:01.313]  Iraq did not possess chemical or biological munitions.
[00:54:02.051 --> 00:54:05.912]  By the middle of the 1990s, Scott Ritter had no chance of getting nuclear weapons.
[00:54:05.912 --> 00:54:11.234]  They had absolutely none whatsoever, and they were never involved in 9-1-1 whatsoever.
[00:54:11.234 --> 00:54:13.155]  What are we going to do about the one next door to them?
[00:54:13.155 --> 00:54:14.576]  I ran there, got it.
[00:54:14.576 --> 00:54:15.536]  What are we going to do about them?
[00:54:16.501 --> 00:54:18.082]  You know, again, this whole thing.
[00:54:18.082 --> 00:54:20.064]  In North Korea, what are we going to do about this?
[00:54:20.064 --> 00:54:20.925]  Where are we going to stop?
[00:54:20.925 --> 00:54:24.227]  Well, your buddy Donald Rumsfeld helped give them the reactors.
[00:54:24.227 --> 00:54:25.548]  All of our buddies.
[00:54:25.548 --> 00:54:26.448]  He's our good friend.
[00:54:26.448 --> 00:54:28.890]  Well, I think it's time to take care of our country.
[00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:34.274]  How about pulling all of our people back here, and we'll stand off anybody that comes, dammit.
[00:54:34.274 --> 00:54:36.275]  And we don't have to go somewhere else.
[00:54:36.275 --> 00:54:39.738]  If they want to kill each other and take over each other's countries, that's fine.
[00:54:39.738 --> 00:54:40.879]  Let's set a boundary here.
[00:54:40.879 --> 00:54:41.759]  Let's put our shields.
[00:54:41.759 --> 00:54:43.961]  Well, I think what Dr. Rocky was saying is that
[00:54:44.747 --> 00:54:49.789]  Friendly fire has killed more of our troops in these last few wars than the enemy, and now the D.U.
[00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:55.132]  and the chemicals are killing tens of thousands, and you're not supposed to talk about it, Dr. Rockey?
[00:54:55.132 --> 00:54:55.772]  That's correct.
[00:54:55.772 --> 00:54:59.414]  I mean, you have to understand, this is coming down to very simple.
[00:54:59.414 --> 00:55:06.137]  It's our own actions, and our total disregard for the consequences of the weapon systems that we use.
[00:55:06.992 --> 00:55:11.956]  And the destruction of the nation's infrastructure that we wrought when we go in on there.
[00:55:11.956 --> 00:55:14.938]  Let me just finish up with Mr. Garten real quick.
[00:55:14.938 --> 00:55:18.040]  Mr. Garten, I want to thank you for coming on the broadcast.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.481]  I'm really sorry about your son.
[00:55:19.481 --> 00:55:24.364]  Our prayers go with you and your family and your son, of course.
[00:55:24.364 --> 00:55:27.867]  And thank you for coming on and helping expose what DU really does.
[00:55:27.867 --> 00:55:31.469]  And hopefully we can change these policies and save a lot of lives.
[00:55:31.469 --> 00:55:32.350]  Thank you for having me.
[00:55:33.547 --> 00:55:38.633]  Doctor, you take care and I hope things get better for you and better for everybody.
[00:55:38.633 --> 00:55:40.035]  Thank you very much.
[00:55:40.035 --> 00:55:41.717]  We're going to take care of our troops, sir.
[00:55:41.717 --> 00:55:42.918]  We'll be right back with Doctor Robbins.
[00:55:45.658 --> 00:55:53.307]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:55:53.307 --> 00:55:58.273]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:55:58.273 --> 00:56:03.919]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.020]  We're good to go.
[00:56:28.766 --> 00:56:29.186]  We're good to go.
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:47.803]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:56:47.803 --> 00:56:52.246]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:56:52.246 --> 00:56:55.209]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:56:55.209 --> 00:56:57.811]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:56:57.811 --> 00:57:06.638]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:57:06.638 --> 00:57:08.200]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:12.363]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:57:12.683 --> 00:57:13.444]  We're good to go.
[00:57:45.644 --> 00:57:48.425]  Those dark depressing days are here.
[00:57:48.425 --> 00:57:52.526]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[00:57:52.526 --> 00:57:56.727]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[00:57:56.727 --> 00:57:59.728]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[00:57:59.728 --> 00:58:02.669]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[00:58:02.669 --> 00:58:04.029]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[00:58:04.816 --> 00:58:07.078]  Is your life on hold to the spring?
[00:58:07.078 --> 00:58:08.119]  Check with your doctor.
[00:58:08.119 --> 00:58:13.505]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SADS, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[00:58:13.505 --> 00:58:18.890]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights.
[00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:19.831]  Light up your life.
[00:58:19.831 --> 00:58:22.494]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with a northern light.
[00:58:23.075 --> 00:58:38.065]  Call Northern Light Technologies at 800-263-0066 and speak to one of our trained representatives or visit us at northernlighttechnologies.com That's northernlighttechnologies.com Our phone number again is 800-263-0066 Big Brother
[00:58:50.715 --> 00:58:52.497]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:52.497 --> 00:58:54.238]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:54.238 --> 00:58:55.840]  You want answers?
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.401]  Well, so does he.
[00:58:57.401 --> 00:59:01.585]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:01.585 --> 00:59:05.708]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:06.489]  1,000 pounds!
[00:59:06.489 --> 00:59:08.551]  Imagine a 1,000 pound dirty bomb.
[00:59:19.611 --> 00:59:25.795]  I mean, the horrible dirty bombs they've talked about that Al-Qaeda is going to try to use on us might weigh a couple hundred pounds.
[00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:29.037]  Well, our government hasn't used 1,000 pounds.
[00:59:29.037 --> 00:59:33.179]  They've used 1,000 tons.
[00:59:33.179 --> 00:59:33.659]  Which is what?
[00:59:33.659 --> 00:59:36.381]  Roughly 3,000 pounds.
[00:59:36.381 --> 00:59:38.923]  In Iraq, just this round.
[00:59:38.923 --> 00:59:41.304]  And a third of that in the first Gulf War.
[00:59:41.304 --> 00:59:42.745]  Near that in Serbia.
[00:59:42.745 --> 00:59:46.927]  They've used near those levels in Afghanistan.
[00:59:46.927 --> 00:59:47.908]  Their own manuals.
[00:59:48.809 --> 00:59:57.453]  Going back to the 70s, say that it does this, and then we have their own memos where they say we've got to cover this up because it's such a good weapon.
[00:59:57.453 --> 01:00:05.136]  And then we march our troops in as disposable heroes, and then I've gotten emails before, ah, you commie, shut up!
[01:00:05.791 --> 01:00:12.735]  Well, you just call up Mr. Garten, then, who just lost his son, and you go and you look at the graves, or you go to the funerals of these troops.
[01:00:12.735 --> 01:00:14.816]  There's people dying right here in Austin.
[01:00:14.816 --> 01:00:18.258]  Troops that come back and die and are buried up in the ground!
[01:00:18.258 --> 01:00:27.183]  And they get these muscle spasms, these high fevers, they do the tests, they've got DU in them, from Texas to New York to Florida, the tests have been done!
[01:00:27.183 --> 01:00:28.904]  And so if you really care about the troops,
[01:00:29.676 --> 01:00:42.019]  If you really care about what's happening to them, you call your gods, Rush Limbaugh and the rest of them, these neocons who aren't real conservatives, and you demand they talk about this.
[01:00:42.019 --> 01:00:43.299]  It's real funny, isn't it?
[01:00:43.299 --> 01:00:45.379]  You don't really care about the troops or America.
[01:00:45.379 --> 01:00:49.840]  You care about feeling like you're on a football team, the winning team, the neocon team.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.681]  Well, your Democrat buddies did it too!
[01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:58.082]  We're going to go back to Dr. Rockey here in just a second and give him the floor and go over how we stopped this, what it's really doing,
[01:00:59.016 --> 01:01:00.077]  Why they're doing it.
[01:01:00.077 --> 01:01:04.779]  On InfoWars.com we have his three questions from Dr. Doug Rocky, Ph.D.
[01:01:04.779 --> 01:01:08.901]  to the Department of Defense concerning its use of radioactive weapons.
[01:01:08.901 --> 01:01:10.461]  And I want to go over these three points with him.
[01:01:10.461 --> 01:01:15.063]  Before we do that, just briefly, because I didn't plug them in the last hour.
[01:01:15.063 --> 01:01:16.424]  We fund this broadcast.
[01:01:17.384 --> 01:01:29.971]  And my staff and the four websites and what we do off your purchases of my documentary films, my book, Paul Watson's book, the other videos and books and tapes we sell, ThatInfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[01:03:04.817 --> 01:03:13.299]  PrisonPlanet.tv, make the New Year's resolution to get the videos or to get a membership and to take action because it's such a powerful tool in waking people up.
[01:03:13.299 --> 01:03:18.861]  Dr. Rocky, continuing here, I mean, where should we go now?
[01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:22.923]  I mean, talking to Mr. Garton, you know, hearing about how his son died,
[01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:37.176]  Number one, what are the numbers that you've got since DU was first used thirteen years ago in the first Gulf War and now used in three other areas, well four other areas, also here in the U.S.
[01:03:37.176 --> 01:03:52.183]  at least ten different zones, open air, mass munitions at these different weapons testing grounds and all these battlefields where they're doing these simulated wars.
[01:03:52.183 --> 01:03:54.384]  How many people are sick and dying from this?
[01:03:56.161 --> 01:03:58.822]  We have to look at all of the combinations of the effects.
[01:03:58.822 --> 01:04:07.307]  We had, you can't isolate the exposures out to one given thing, and that's what's been the absolute horrifying thing about this whole thing.
[01:04:07.307 --> 01:04:17.772]  We know the individuals when they have very specific exposures to uranium munitions contamination by an inhalation, ingestion, or absorption for the shrapnel in their wounds that they're going to have problems.
[01:04:17.772 --> 01:04:22.074]  The, and I'm going to go back to the middle of last year where, you know, I actually have the U.S.
[01:04:22.074 --> 01:04:23.615]  Department of Veteran Affairs reports.
[01:04:25.768 --> 01:04:31.451]  696,841 individuals that served during the Persian Gulf War proper, the combat action from August of 1990 through October-November of 1991.
[01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:34.112]  As of May of last year, 231,000 had put in for claims because they were sick and ill.
[01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:57.790]  And the VA had awarded, this is just those involved in the active combat phase of Gulf War I, 179,310.
[01:04:57.790 --> 01:05:09.016]  Now we know the most current data reports we've had in the last few weeks that this number now is over 181,000 that are a permanent disability.
[01:05:09.016 --> 01:05:11.177]  Now they denied medical care to over 27,000 people.
[01:05:11.177 --> 01:05:11.997]  That includes my own staff.
[01:05:15.934 --> 01:05:21.379]  I'm still, we were just fighting the last few days trying to get my own staff medical care 14 years after the fact.
[01:05:21.379 --> 01:05:25.522]  And you were there removing the destroyed vehicles that had been shot up with this stuff?
[01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:32.007]  Oh yeah, we were doing everything under the sun with hazardous materials, all the dehumiditions, the chem bio and rad, the whole mess.
[01:05:32.007 --> 01:05:33.889]  So that's what we know has happened.
[01:05:33.889 --> 01:05:39.173]  Now of everybody that served in the Persian Gulf region from August of 1990 through May of 2004
[01:05:44.781 --> 01:05:50.825]  We had over 327,000 that have put in for permanent claims, the VA.
[01:05:50.825 --> 01:05:54.247]  And the VA had awarded permanent disabilities over 257,000.
[01:05:54.247 --> 01:05:57.689]  That's one-third of the force.
[01:05:57.689 --> 01:06:04.274]  Now I read the number that as of a few years ago was 35,000 of the troops have died for different reasons.
[01:06:04.274 --> 01:06:07.096]  Now I'm hearing that number is 50,000 just from the first Gulf War.
[01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:08.456]  Is that accurate?
[01:06:08.456 --> 01:06:09.177]  Probably too low.
[01:06:10.985 --> 01:06:12.026]  I can't get over it.
[01:06:12.026 --> 01:06:13.567]  It's just astonishing.
[01:06:13.567 --> 01:06:17.750]  Then we go to Operation Iraqi Freedom.
[01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:23.513]  Again, as of August of this last year, we already had the VA award a permanent disability to 27,571.
[01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:24.594]  We're at 20% within one year.
[01:06:24.594 --> 01:06:25.335]  We had 153 cases of cancer.
[01:06:25.335 --> 01:06:26.755]  Let's go to some of the bigger numbers.
[01:06:26.755 --> 01:06:28.477]  5,375 of the neuropsych.
[01:06:39.498 --> 01:06:45.560]  Uh, over 5,000 neurological, respiratory, digestive, over 6,000.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.160]  I mean, we're seeing skin problems.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.781]  It's just devastated me and all my staff.
[01:06:49.781 --> 01:06:52.342]  Neuromuscular, over 8,000.
[01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:55.663]  Um, these are permanent problems already with the kids.
[01:06:55.663 --> 01:06:56.803]  Well, let's get personal.
[01:06:56.803 --> 01:06:58.244]  Your team, how big was it?
[01:06:58.244 --> 01:06:59.524]  How many people have gotten cancer?
[01:06:59.524 --> 01:07:00.844]  How many have died?
[01:07:00.844 --> 01:07:02.545]  Real good, hard put together.
[01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:05.342]  If we look at the total number of individuals the U.S.
[01:07:05.342 --> 01:07:11.066]  Department of Defense totally acknowledges involved in friendly fire, plus all of our cleanup, that's over 400 individuals.
[01:07:11.066 --> 01:07:14.428]  From a group of how many?
[01:07:14.428 --> 01:07:15.789]  That's over 400 individuals.
[01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:19.031]  So out of 400 individuals, how many have gotten cancer?
[01:07:19.031 --> 01:07:25.215]  It's a real hard thing to put, but we've been able, looking at all the data, we've got well over 20 are dead out of the primary 100.
[01:07:26.354 --> 01:07:31.019]  Now, the thing that's astonishing, which is really bad news on this... Well, that's 20% out of the primary 100.
[01:07:31.019 --> 01:07:32.540]  Yeah, it is.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:44.132]  And what we look at, which is really bad news on this whole thing, is even though we had 424 individuals there that I can specifically identify, the Department of Defense has totally acknowledged in their own documents.
[01:07:45.037 --> 01:07:57.363]  They told President Bill Clinton back in 1998, that was seven years after the fact, they'd only notified 104 and 105 individuals out of 424 that they need medical care seven years after the fact.
[01:07:57.363 --> 01:08:07.288]  And as the Department of Defense is totally acknowledging here even recently... So they're even admitting, yes, you've been poisoned, you need care, but the mainstream media still, is DU bad for you?
[01:08:07.288 --> 01:08:09.910]  Well, the other thing too is, but you can't get medical care.
[01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:14.092]  I mean, you know, up until even the last few days, I'm still trying to get medical care for my sergeant.
[01:08:14.938 --> 01:08:18.962]  They claim the Department of the Army National Records Center in St.
[01:08:18.962 --> 01:08:21.104]  Louis, Missouri claims it was never there.
[01:08:21.104 --> 01:08:25.548]  But you go to the unclassified classified reports and the FOCO sees all over the place.
[01:08:25.548 --> 01:08:34.916]  So what we have is just a total, absolute disregard for the existing orders and regulations that mandate medical care for everybody.
[01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:36.798]  And they just totally walk away.
[01:08:36.798 --> 01:08:41.322]  Now the thing, and this is the horrifying thing about this thing, and which has really bothered me completely,
[01:08:41.949 --> 01:08:47.371]  Now we have another one of our warriors, another son, Sergeant Gardner, who's died.
[01:08:47.371 --> 01:08:49.611]  Over nothing.
[01:08:49.611 --> 01:08:51.392]  That's what's really the tragedy here.
[01:08:51.392 --> 01:08:53.573]  It's all over nothing.
[01:08:53.573 --> 01:09:09.117]  But then when we send our troops in with inadequate training, for example, right here near Champaign, Illinois, we're getting ready to deploy over 600 members of the 2nd Battalion, 130th Illinois Army Infantry National Guard to Iraq.
[01:09:09.117 --> 01:09:10.398]  They're leaving within hours.
[01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:13.962]  Okay, that's how close it is.
[01:09:13.962 --> 01:09:16.062]  They do not have the training because I've talked to them.
[01:09:16.062 --> 01:09:18.983]  They do not have the equipment.
[01:09:18.983 --> 01:09:21.124]  And they're being sent into a nightmare again.
[01:09:21.124 --> 01:09:26.505]  Well, I've read the Army doesn't even allow the issuance of the training manuals, Bob, do you?
[01:09:26.505 --> 01:09:27.485]  Well, they haven't done that.
[01:09:27.485 --> 01:09:33.907]  I mean, the number of orders that were issued once I completed all this stuff back in the 90s and again reissued in the total
[01:09:34.562 --> 01:09:37.364]  His refusal to do it is just continued travesty.
[01:09:37.364 --> 01:09:40.567]  Why every war do they do this to our troops and now it's getting even worse?
[01:09:40.567 --> 01:09:48.753]  I mean, why do they almost take an enjoyment in hurting the troops even greater than the enemy does and then not even giving them treatment?
[01:09:48.753 --> 01:09:53.976]  Well, part of the thing is it's just one in the battle and one in the war with a total disregard for health and environmental effects.
[01:09:53.976 --> 01:09:57.639]  You have to understand, this goes back to what I learned from my days in Vietnam.
[01:09:57.639 --> 01:09:58.640]  We're totally expendable.
[01:09:59.389 --> 01:10:05.274]  Well, that shows Rumsfeld's disconnect, going, hey, you go to war with the army you got.
[01:10:05.274 --> 01:10:07.976]  They had years to get ready for this.
[01:10:07.976 --> 01:10:11.839]  Well, we actually planned to put this together years ago.
[01:10:11.839 --> 01:10:17.484]  So all the stuff that's happening, when you look at the training, the operations, and all the exercise we have is all put together.
[01:10:17.484 --> 01:10:19.265]  But it's total disregard.
[01:10:19.265 --> 01:10:20.466]  It's real simple.
[01:10:21.152 --> 01:10:24.596]  The United States uses uranium munitions because they're extremely effective.
[01:10:24.596 --> 01:10:40.732]  They destroy a nation's infrastructure, release all the toxic industrial chemicals, they don't provide the troops with the protection they needed, they don't clean up the mess that they're supposed to do, then they put the troops in there, and the kids come back sick, and they die, and nobody gives a flying f***!
[01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:48.865]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:10:48.865 --> 01:10:49.525]  Why?
[01:10:49.525 --> 01:10:52.227]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[01:11:46.593 --> 01:11:49.173]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[01:11:49.173 --> 01:11:53.574]  The Real Money Folks.
[01:11:53.574 --> 01:11:55.975]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:11:55.975 --> 01:11:57.035]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:11:57.035 --> 01:11:58.375]  The Dow has ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:11:58.375 --> 01:11:59.495]  A 5% increase.
[01:11:59.495 --> 01:12:02.196]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the year-old.
[01:12:02.196 --> 01:12:05.196]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed year-old.
[01:12:14.818 --> 01:12:17.180]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:21.063]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:12:21.063 --> 01:12:24.646]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[01:12:24.646 --> 01:12:31.111]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.

[01:12:58.237 --> 01:13:02.903]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:13:03.383 --> 01:13:10.512]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.

[01:13:45.908 --> 01:13:53.574]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[01:13:53.574 --> 01:13:58.478]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[01:13:58.478 --> 01:14:02.581]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[01:14:02.581 --> 01:14:05.503]  Super Silver is a combination of supercharged silver and oxygen.
[01:14:05.823 --> 01:14:12.927]  Has been proven to kill hundreds of bacteria and be at least two to three hundred percent more effective than any other silver product.
[01:14:12.927 --> 01:14:21.832]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:28.136]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[01:14:42.382 --> 01:14:51.026]  I want the military personnel listening.
[01:14:51.026 --> 01:14:52.707]  I want the police listening.
[01:14:52.707 --> 01:14:56.689]  I want people that serve this government who are listening to understand.
[01:14:58.624 --> 01:15:09.788]  They admittedly left 20 plus thousand American and British POWs in Nazi camps and let Stalin have them.
[01:15:09.788 --> 01:15:10.668]  That's admitted!
[01:15:10.668 --> 01:15:13.189]  I have the documents, mainstream.
[01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:20.792]  Roosevelt, and this is now, the documents were declassified two years ago in major New York papers, but just back of the paper,
[01:15:22.154 --> 01:15:32.038]  Ordered the Navy to leave 7,000 American citizens in the Philippines so they'd be captured because it would, quote, be good propaganda in the newsreels.
[01:15:32.038 --> 01:15:33.879]  7,000 lives.
[01:15:33.879 --> 01:15:36.079]  4,000 plus of them died in the camps.
[01:15:36.079 --> 01:15:47.524]  I've interviewed people who were six years old in the camps, watching their mothers and fathers being tortured and raped by the Japanese, who were pretty brittle, just so they could have some propaganda in newsreels about having our civilians.
[01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:53.017]  Oh, but they wouldn't be involved in 9-11, the globalists would.
[01:15:53.017 --> 01:15:53.857]  Oh, no.
[01:15:53.857 --> 01:15:58.080]  They wouldn't market drugs that they know are dangerous on the market.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.542]  The government cares about you.
[01:16:00.542 --> 01:16:02.303]  The government loves you.
[01:16:02.303 --> 01:16:06.266]  The government's run by sweetie pies that are just so nice.
[01:16:06.266 --> 01:16:12.070]  And Dr. Rocky, most of the troops and police I've talked to know something's wrong, support what I'm doing, what you're doing.
[01:16:12.771 --> 01:16:27.383]  But, a few weeks ago, I was buying some Christmas presents at Academy's Sporting Goods Store, and a guy walked up, and, you know, he's like, I fly helicopters with the Night Stalkers, and I'm like, you know, you're full of it, and blah blah blah, and I said, well, you know, the vaccines have been admitted to be deadly.
[01:16:27.383 --> 01:16:28.504]  I mean, that's admitted.
[01:16:28.504 --> 01:16:29.505]  Ah, whatever.
[01:16:29.505 --> 01:16:32.528]  Well, you better watch out with DU, and he started laughing at me.
[01:16:33.388 --> 01:16:39.052]  I mean, you know, what's funny about this when their own manuals say it, but I'm bad?
[01:16:39.052 --> 01:16:41.774]  How is it not patriotic that I stand up for the troops?
[01:16:41.774 --> 01:16:45.917]  That I gave out the phone number to raise money for this dead soldier's family?
[01:16:45.917 --> 01:16:51.861]  How is that bad, but these people just sit there doing nothing for the soldiers, and even some soldiers laugh about it, Dr. Rockey?
[01:16:51.861 --> 01:16:54.883]  I wish I had the answer to that question.
[01:16:54.883 --> 01:16:58.445]  Many, many years ago, between combat missions, we were...
[01:16:59.810 --> 01:17:02.952]  Vietnam days, and some events happened.
[01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:05.313]  My commanding general was right there.
[01:17:05.313 --> 01:17:06.254]  I stayed in touch with him.
[01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:07.715]  We stayed friends for over 30 years.
[01:17:07.715 --> 01:17:17.981]  He had told us back in Vietnam days, between combat missions, he said, you know, I'm going to always take care of you, and I want you to always take care of the troops, because that's our primary responsibility.
[01:17:17.981 --> 01:17:28.708]  Well, right before he died here a few years ago, he looked at me and said, well, Sergeant Rock, because at that time I was a sergeant, ended up going through all the ranks, he said, Sergeant Rock, that's how he remembered me.
[01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:31.551]  Are you still taking care of the troops?
[01:17:31.551 --> 01:17:34.193]  And General, yes sir I am.
[01:17:34.193 --> 01:17:44.320]  What we have to understand with uranium munitions use, the United States made the conscious, United States officials, Department of Defense officials, You have the document!
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:51.045]  Oh absolutely, made the conscious choice to use uranium munitions in disregard to health and environmental effects.
[01:17:51.045 --> 01:17:56.629]  The Army Regulation, and I'm looking at it right here, signed by General Shinseki who issued the original order
[01:17:57.389 --> 01:18:06.951]  Back in October 93 to clean up the medical care, provide all the training, and clean up all environmental contamination that got me on this whole DU project.
[01:18:06.951 --> 01:18:18.853]  This Army regulation specifically states, I'm going to read this quote, Commanders Radiation Safety Officer will identify, segregate, isolate, secure, and label all radiologically contaminated equipment.
[01:18:18.853 --> 01:18:23.694]  Procedures to minimize the spread of radioactivity will be implemented as soon as possible.
[01:18:23.694 --> 01:18:26.595]  Okay, that's not a question, that's a direct order.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:39.166]  The unit team individual responsible for the equipment, whether friendly or foreign, at the time of damage or contamination, responsible for taking all actions consistent with this regulation and the pamphlet that I wrote.
[01:18:39.166 --> 01:18:40.887]  We come on down.
[01:18:40.887 --> 01:18:50.993]  All equipment to include captured or combat radiologically contaminated equipment will be surveyed, packaged, retrograded, decontaminated, and released in accordance with the Technical Bulletin 9-1300-278.
[01:18:50.993 --> 01:18:52.234]  That specifies contamination levels.
[01:18:57.062 --> 01:19:03.307]  Personnel, quote, personnel handling contaminated equipment need to follow personal safety measures outlined in the pamphlet.
[01:19:03.307 --> 01:19:06.750]  That requires full respiratory and skin protection.
[01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:09.432]  We keep coming on down.
[01:19:09.432 --> 01:19:12.235]  Rush Limbaugh says it's nutritious!
[01:19:12.235 --> 01:19:12.975]  How about that lady?
[01:19:12.975 --> 01:19:15.137]  How about he eats some with his ladies?
[01:19:15.137 --> 01:19:17.499]  How about let him eat all this stuff?
[01:19:17.499 --> 01:19:20.501]  You know, the requirements exist.
[01:19:20.501 --> 01:19:21.822]  The U.S.
[01:19:21.822 --> 01:19:24.485]  Army regulation, which has the same force as U.S.
[01:19:24.485 --> 01:19:25.966]  federal law, requires
[01:19:26.653 --> 01:19:27.994]  Thorough cleanup.
[01:19:27.994 --> 01:19:29.735]  We come on down to the next section.
[01:19:29.735 --> 01:19:32.457]  It absolutely mandates medical care.
[01:19:32.457 --> 01:19:33.918]  Not a question.
[01:19:33.918 --> 01:19:35.459]  Not a thing, well, I'll think about it.
[01:19:35.459 --> 01:19:39.082]  It says, thou shalt provide medical care.
[01:19:39.082 --> 01:19:52.451]  When we look at the technical bulletin that we revised based on all our research and first-hand experience, not somebody sitting at a desk thinking about this stuff.
[01:19:53.413 --> 01:19:57.396]  But what you really do with it and how you clean up the mess.
[01:19:57.396 --> 01:19:59.337]  That's the kind of science I did.
[01:19:59.337 --> 01:20:01.178]  That's what I did as a super garbage man.
[01:20:01.178 --> 01:20:03.340]  I had to clean up the mess.
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:04.100]  Okay?
[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:14.067]  And so when you look at the very specific specifications, it's not, i.e., something that you say, I can get around with.
[01:20:14.067 --> 01:20:22.633]  We know that the level of contamination that exists throughout Iraq and the camps with the soldiers there and the combat areas exceeds any permissible levels.
[01:20:23.211 --> 01:20:27.215]  We know the Department of Defense officials are not cleaning up, they're not providing the troops adequate cover.
[01:20:27.215 --> 01:20:27.736]  Stay there, Doctor.
[01:20:27.736 --> 01:20:30.619]  Let's do a few more minutes on the other side and take some calls.
[01:20:30.619 --> 01:20:35.504]  Let's come back and talk about it.
[01:20:35.504 --> 01:20:36.906]  We're on the march.
[01:20:36.906 --> 01:20:39.429]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:20:39.429 --> 01:20:42.112]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:45.197 --> 01:20:49.181]  You've heard about PAWS from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology.
[01:20:49.181 --> 01:20:53.706]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[01:20:53.706 --> 01:21:00.634]  Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[01:21:01.014 --> 01:21:07.985]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[01:21:07.985 --> 01:21:11.470]  But in minutes you can remove those problems with Bio-Ox such as Concentrate.
[01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:12.251]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit bio-ox.com
[01:21:16.557 --> 01:21:23.783]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason Bio-Ox International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[01:21:23.783 --> 01:21:30.688]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[01:21:30.688 --> 01:21:35.551]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.
[01:21:35.551 --> 01:21:38.253]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[01:21:38.253 --> 01:21:42.917]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use Bio-Ox family of products.
[01:21:44.853 --> 01:21:46.894]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:21:46.894 --> 01:21:58.000]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.583]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:13.929]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:22:14.509 --> 01:22:21.758]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:22:21.758 --> 01:22:24.382]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:22:24.382 --> 01:22:29.348]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[01:22:29.648 --> 01:22:36.036]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:22:36.036 --> 01:22:40.442]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:22:40.442 --> 01:22:41.223]  That's toll free.
[01:22:41.223 --> 01:22:41.263]  888-803-4438.
[01:22:45.007 --> 01:22:48.549]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[01:22:48.549 --> 01:22:50.910]  Not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:58.434]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:22:58.434 --> 01:23:01.956]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[01:23:01.956 --> 01:23:04.337]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:23:04.337 --> 01:23:12.141]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:13.802]  Either way, why chance it?
[01:23:13.802 --> 01:23:24.028]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[01:23:38.275 --> 01:23:39.476]  That's 877-835-5555.
[01:23:39.476 --> 01:23:42.557]  Or visit ZMineral.com.
[01:23:42.557 --> 01:23:54.281]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:54.281 --> 01:23:57.402]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:00.015 --> 01:24:05.158]  I know we've had loaded phones for the last hour and a half, but I haven't been taking calls because I've had two guests on about DU.
[01:24:05.158 --> 01:24:21.529]  If you want to talk about depleted uranium, or examples of our government not caring about its own minions, just to show you how ruthless these corporate creatures are, we'll go to John and Roger and a few others that are holding, plus a caller wants to talk about a
[01:24:22.893 --> 01:24:27.414]  Casper, Wyoming, Star Tribune article about Clarence Thomas, the Bohemian Grove.
[01:24:27.414 --> 01:24:33.216]  I saw it this morning, didn't print it for some reason, didn't bring it, but we'll talk to that caller about that too.
[01:24:33.216 --> 01:24:33.856]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:33.856 --> 01:24:41.418]  You want to talk to Dr. Doug Rocky, an American hero, Vietnam veteran.
[01:24:41.418 --> 01:24:46.259]  Literally wrote the book in the early 90s on DU and how deadly it is for the Pentagon.
[01:24:46.259 --> 01:24:48.520]  The official Army regulations, not being followed.
[01:24:49.594 --> 01:24:57.955]  And then the neocons get on radio, like the gun-grabbing, open-border, big-government-promoting scum they are, and tell you, it's conservative, it's good for you.
[01:24:57.955 --> 01:24:58.896]  I mean, I've heard them.
[01:24:58.896 --> 01:24:59.896]  It's good for you.
[01:24:59.896 --> 01:25:00.916]  It's not bad.
[01:25:00.916 --> 01:25:02.336]  It's safe.
[01:25:02.336 --> 01:25:03.176]  It's completed.
[01:25:03.176 --> 01:25:05.217]  It's not a problem.
[01:25:05.217 --> 01:25:06.957]  It's total fraud.
[01:25:06.957 --> 01:25:07.837]  Okay?
[01:25:07.837 --> 01:25:09.678]  Two rims of radiation.
[01:25:09.678 --> 01:25:12.438]  New York Daily News did blood tests at a major firm.
[01:25:12.438 --> 01:25:15.039]  I mean, that's very high levels, folks.
[01:25:15.039 --> 01:25:17.499]  But before we go back to Dr. Rocky and your calls,
[01:25:18.883 --> 01:25:30.074]  I want to play this clip, I've played it probably ten times over the last few months, for local CBS News, this has been all over the country, similar reports, where they tell you new reports, mercury's good for your child's brain!
[01:25:30.074 --> 01:25:32.796]  I expect them to say uranium's good for you soon!
[01:25:32.796 --> 01:25:34.938]  This is the just incredible lying...
[01:25:36.189 --> 01:25:41.132]  I want, you know, from our scientists, from our PhD, I want to get his comment on mercury being nutritious for you.
[01:25:41.132 --> 01:25:42.573]  Go ahead and play this clip.
[01:25:42.573 --> 01:25:45.255]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[01:25:45.255 --> 01:25:48.877]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:53.721]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses, a new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[01:25:53.721 --> 01:25:57.223]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter, Sheila Mathers.
[01:25:59.765 --> 01:26:06.191]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:26:06.191 --> 01:26:12.638]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[01:26:12.638 --> 01:26:19.985]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:26:20.729 --> 01:26:23.531]  We've been moved by the Food and Drug Administration.
[01:26:23.531 --> 01:26:25.733]  Then I get into a new defibrillator.
[01:26:25.733 --> 01:26:37.623]  The point here is that one study was done by a big drug company that makes vaccines, the other by the feds, and they have literally thousands of studies about how bad mercury is for the brain, especially at 200 times safe levels.
[01:26:37.623 --> 01:26:41.166]  That's what a six-month-old gets after the first round of shots.
[01:26:41.166 --> 01:26:45.189]  Dr. Rockey, just a side issue, they're now telling us that mercury is good for us.
[01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:46.530]  Do you think that's true?
[01:26:46.530 --> 01:26:48.992]  This is pure nonsense.
[01:26:48.992 --> 01:26:50.173]  That's about all I can say.
[01:26:51.016 --> 01:26:54.219]  I mean, mercury, like all this stuff, are a toxic heavy metal.
[01:26:54.219 --> 01:26:55.820]  You get into the body, you're going to get sick.
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.141]  It's that simple.
[01:26:57.141 --> 01:26:58.382]  There is no safe level.
[01:26:58.382 --> 01:27:00.484]  This concept right here, there's no safe level.
[01:27:00.484 --> 01:27:02.966]  So it's not just safe, it's good for your brain now?
[01:27:02.966 --> 01:27:09.411]  Well, I mean, we've had the same comments already made about uranium contamination in the body.
[01:27:09.411 --> 01:27:09.711]  U.S.
[01:27:09.711 --> 01:27:12.994]  Army officials have made those same comments recently.
[01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:13.755]  It's pure nonsense.
[01:27:13.755 --> 01:27:15.856]  Wait a minute, they're saying it's nutritious?
[01:27:15.856 --> 01:27:16.797]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:27:16.797 --> 01:27:17.818]  You're joking!
[01:27:17.818 --> 01:27:18.899]  I mean, it's pure nonsense.
[01:27:18.899 --> 01:27:20.340]  You have to understand.
[01:27:20.782 --> 01:27:21.542]  I want to go back.
[01:27:21.542 --> 01:27:23.263]  I'm going to make this loud and clear.
[01:27:23.263 --> 01:27:33.585]  The Los Alamos Memorandum, which you have a link to on your website, very specifically stated, rely on the reports in order to sustain the use of unanimous... Yeah, we've got a link to that, but do you have that in front of you?
[01:27:33.585 --> 01:27:34.905]  Can you read that?
[01:27:34.905 --> 01:27:35.186]  Sure.
[01:27:35.186 --> 01:27:37.146]  And then we'll go to calls.
[01:27:37.146 --> 01:27:40.207]  This is where they're saying, this is a great weapon, let's lie about it.
[01:27:40.207 --> 01:27:45.088]  Take your time to dig it out.
[01:27:45.088 --> 01:27:48.449]  I mean, when we look at all of the stuff that's happening,
[01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:55.035]  I don't even know how to get there.
[01:27:55.035 --> 01:27:55.996]  It's just pure nonsense.
[01:28:08.923 --> 01:28:11.766]  Well, tell us what that particular officer said.
[01:28:11.766 --> 01:28:24.916]  Well, what it said, very specifically stated, we need to ensure the use of uranium munitions, we need to put it together, and there has to be total proponency, and whenever we write after-action reports to ensure that we sustain the use of uranium munitions.
[01:28:24.916 --> 01:28:27.038]  I mean, that's been going off and on forever.
[01:28:27.038 --> 01:28:30.881]  I was director of the Depleted Uranium Project, all this information started coming out, and I'm going,
[01:28:31.502 --> 01:28:36.803]  Well, you know, we've got to all get this put together, but the same thing, we're trying to make sure it's taken care of within the military.
[01:28:36.803 --> 01:28:37.503]  So what's next?
[01:28:37.503 --> 01:28:40.084]  They're going to start saying cyanide's good for you?
[01:28:40.084 --> 01:28:40.744]  Who knows?
[01:28:40.744 --> 01:28:43.905]  I mean, you know, it's just pure, total nonsense.
[01:28:43.905 --> 01:28:49.106]  The thing is that's happening here.
[01:28:49.106 --> 01:28:57.408]  The idea and the concept just to go and destroy and totally disregard the health and environmental effects of warfare, whether it's uranium munitions or destruction of a nation's infrastructure,
[01:28:58.064 --> 01:29:02.787]  And walk away just for power and greed and everything else is what's driving it all around.
[01:29:02.787 --> 01:29:08.771]  The sick part is that the current White House, and it was the same for Clinton, is a bunch of chicken hunks.
[01:29:08.771 --> 01:29:13.533]  Well I mean it's, you know, you have to understand all these people involved in this stuff go back through multiple administrations.
[01:29:13.533 --> 01:29:14.994]  It's not one given thing.
[01:29:14.994 --> 01:29:24.360]  The guys that are running this thing now under Bush 2 were the same ones that were doing it under Clinton and some of them were involved in Bush 1 and they go back forever.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.021]  You need to understand it doesn't change.
[01:29:26.021 --> 01:29:27.402]  It doesn't change.
[01:29:28.434 --> 01:29:36.617]  Uh, the horrifying thing about this thing is, now we've got Sartin Gardner, you know, his, you know, died right after Christmas, you know, and all this stuff.
[01:29:36.617 --> 01:29:39.557]  He was again abandoned by his nation.
[01:29:39.557 --> 01:29:44.099]  But yet, now they have to go out and put a fund together to take care of his children.
[01:29:44.099 --> 01:29:45.779]  Okay?
[01:29:45.779 --> 01:29:47.440]  That's ludicrous.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:52.101]  Bush is about to spend millions upon millions upon millions of dollars for this friggin' inauguration.
[01:29:52.101 --> 01:29:53.182]  Okay?
[01:29:53.182 --> 01:29:57.963]  Why don't they give one of those million dollars to this family and help take care of this family?
[01:29:59.352 --> 01:30:01.554]  That's where the reality is.
[01:30:01.554 --> 01:30:22.195]  I'm tired of our nation's soldiers being sent to war with inadequate training, with inadequate equipment, in totally contaminated environments, not being provided the mandated medical care that is required by direct orders, put into areas where the contamination is all over the place because it has not been cleaned up,
[01:30:22.777 --> 01:30:25.078]  Even though it's absolutely required by U.S.
[01:30:25.078 --> 01:30:28.158]  Army Regulation, Department of Defense Regulations.
[01:30:28.158 --> 01:30:33.020]  Well, they used three times as much DU in Iraq this time as 14 years ago.
[01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:34.820]  Or 13 and a half years ago.
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:36.380]  The country's crashed.
[01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:40.521]  And they used it in all the populated areas instead of out in the middle of the desert.
[01:30:40.521 --> 01:30:44.562]  And if we've had thousands of people die from it the first one, what are the numbers going to be this time?
[01:30:44.562 --> 01:30:46.323]  I mean, the numbers are already astronomical.
[01:30:46.323 --> 01:30:51.524]  When we're looking at over 20% of the current force after one year already being permanently disabled.
[01:30:52.082 --> 01:30:54.725]  You've got to ask what the question is.
[01:30:54.725 --> 01:31:01.131]  It's not, i.e., 6 or 8 thousand that have been wounded and another 1,200 or 1,400 that have died.
[01:31:01.131 --> 01:31:05.375]  It's all these other thousand that have died, like Sergeant Gardner, that are not counted.
[01:31:05.375 --> 01:31:09.979]  And it's all these other 27,000 that have already been given permanent disability within one year.
[01:31:09.979 --> 01:31:14.123]  I mean, the casualty count is just astronomical.
[01:31:14.123 --> 01:31:16.386]  And it's over nothing.
[01:31:16.386 --> 01:31:16.646]  Okay?
[01:31:17.625 --> 01:31:20.166]  The regulations mandate medical care.
[01:31:20.166 --> 01:31:22.628]  The regulations mandate... Well, that's my point.
[01:31:22.628 --> 01:31:31.513]  Why did I have an Army officer laughing at me saying he'd been told it was a conspiracy by his superiors when I was saying, your own manual says it's deadly.
[01:31:31.513 --> 01:31:33.394]  And he's laughing at me.
[01:31:33.394 --> 01:31:33.894]  They're fools.
[01:31:33.894 --> 01:31:39.337]  You have to remember, you get in this mindset where they got everything put together, okay?
[01:31:39.337 --> 01:31:44.360]  And the individual, the group think, and they say, well, this is what they tell me, so therefore it's there.
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.401]  You know, if I hadn't been there and learned it myself,
[01:31:47.515 --> 01:31:53.658]  Okay, and went through the process of understanding what happened and making the decision I can't go along with this nonsense anymore.
[01:31:53.658 --> 01:31:56.199]  I might have stuck in there with those guys.
[01:31:56.199 --> 01:32:06.064]  But what I learned and what I saw in a military career that spanned over, you know, well over 30 years, and all these special considerations, is they don't care.
[01:32:06.064 --> 01:32:12.787]  And for a soldier that believes this stuff, but doesn't look and says, I'll give you an example.
[01:32:12.787 --> 01:32:13.247]  The U.S.
[01:32:13.247 --> 01:32:17.189]  Army and Department of Defense officials that are responsible for radiation safety,
[01:32:18.314 --> 01:32:18.694]  We're good to go.
[01:32:32.774 --> 01:32:36.655]  And the environmental contamination is cleaned up as ordered by General Shinseki.
[01:32:36.655 --> 01:32:38.295]  They refuse to help us do that.
[01:32:38.295 --> 01:32:45.197]  So when we here support the troops, that means live in denial, drink your six-pack, don't care about the troops.
[01:32:45.197 --> 01:32:47.138]  Now this is number three of your three questions.
[01:32:47.138 --> 01:32:59.501]  By what legal or ethical right can members of the United States military or any other nation's military disperse tons of uranium weapons with radioactive and heavy metal toxic contamination, America's own dirty bomb, any place
[01:33:00.746 --> 01:33:10.271]  In the world, when those radioactive materials will then contaminate air, water, soil with consequence of adverse health effects, as we know, will occur.
[01:33:10.271 --> 01:33:13.653]  We must remember that one of the findings published by the U.S.
[01:33:13.653 --> 01:33:18.276]  Army Environment Policy Institute in their 1995 report on depleted uranium was quoted.
[01:33:18.776 --> 01:33:25.484]  No available toxicology can significantly change the inherent chemical and radiological toxicity of DU.
[01:33:25.484 --> 01:33:28.268]  These are intrinsic properties of uranium.
[01:33:28.268 --> 01:33:31.431]  Hey, mercury's bad for you folks in high levels.
[01:33:31.431 --> 01:33:32.853]  Uranium's bad for you.
[01:33:32.853 --> 01:33:38.440]  It is not vitamin C. And we're radical, Dr. Rockey.
[01:33:39.119 --> 01:33:43.506]  Because you were one of the head guys who wrote the book on this for them.
[01:33:43.506 --> 01:33:45.989]  You're radical because you say it as the troops die.
[01:33:45.989 --> 01:33:48.353]  I'm radical because I know Mercury isn't good for me.
[01:33:50.034 --> 01:33:51.836]  The world's turned topsy-turvy.
[01:33:51.836 --> 01:33:52.817]  Let's take some calls.
[01:33:52.817 --> 01:33:53.758]  John in New York.
[01:33:53.758 --> 01:33:57.481]  You're on the air with insane people that think uranium is bad for you.
[01:33:57.481 --> 01:33:58.242]  Go ahead.
[01:33:58.242 --> 01:33:58.722]  Hi.
[01:33:58.722 --> 01:34:00.864]  I'm just going to tell you about a VA hospital.
[01:34:00.864 --> 01:34:01.725]  I got about three points.
[01:34:01.725 --> 01:34:02.666]  I'll make it quick.
[01:34:02.666 --> 01:34:04.648]  VA hospital here in our town.
[01:34:04.648 --> 01:34:06.529]  They tried to fire one of the local workers.
[01:34:06.529 --> 01:34:07.530]  He had a bad back.
[01:34:07.530 --> 01:34:08.932]  They tried not to pay my workman's comp.
[01:34:10.819 --> 01:34:12.520]  Ended up going through court procedures and all that.
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:19.342]  When it got said and done, the boss put paperwork in his file that was balked, and the secretary admitted that in court.
[01:34:19.342 --> 01:34:21.983]  So anyhow, he proved his case and he got his job back.
[01:34:21.983 --> 01:34:29.225]  When it got said and done, the job was... the description of what actually happened is a fraudulent description put in a file, and the boss has still got his job.
[01:34:30.121 --> 01:34:40.005]  Secondly, can we use like pH to dictate possibly a measure of if you've got DU would be an inherent measure of hey I got a problem here it might be an indicator.
[01:34:40.005 --> 01:34:46.848]  Secondly, my son other son went into military and he was a band-aid you know there'll be a medical
[01:34:47.412 --> 01:34:52.354]  And when I came out of the military, a year later, he tells me oxygen is bad for you.
[01:34:52.354 --> 01:34:53.674]  I said, who the hell told you that?
[01:34:53.674 --> 01:34:57.836]  Excuse my language, but, you know, here's just the other extreme of the case.
[01:34:57.836 --> 01:35:04.578]  And the last thing is, as far as the UN outlaws using dirty bombs or whatever else,
[01:35:05.225 --> 01:35:16.913]  Now, they've got a tool for ourselves to use that, hey, you didn't enforce law on that side, so now when you say we've got a mandate that we're going to be Euro or World Order or whatever, we don't have to mandate that rule because you didn't mandate the other rule.
[01:35:16.913 --> 01:35:19.134]  It's just, it's a bad game again.
[01:35:19.134 --> 01:35:19.835]  Thank you very much.
[01:35:19.835 --> 01:35:20.976]  Thank you, John.
[01:35:20.976 --> 01:35:26.519]  Yeah, this systemic corruption in the VA, would you like to speak to that, Dr. Rockey?
[01:35:26.519 --> 01:35:27.840]  Well, it's an ongoing thing.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:33.384]  I mean, what has happened is care has been denied, inappropriate care has been given.
[01:35:34.392 --> 01:35:38.675]  care has been delayed or when they give you the care, they totally disregard it.
[01:35:38.675 --> 01:35:43.618]  When you go in for health problems, they totally disregard it or they just say we're doing you a favor.
[01:35:43.618 --> 01:35:46.120]  And I want to add a caveat to police and firemen listening.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:49.362]  This is NBC News, folks, the back of the paper.
[01:35:49.362 --> 01:35:53.565]  And this is in the 9-11 section of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:53.565 --> 01:35:58.288]  Those buildings, Tower 1 and 2, were built, were insulated with asbestos.
[01:35:58.288 --> 01:36:00.189]  That's admitted!
[01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:02.090]  And the people got incredibly sick.
[01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:02.811]  The FDA
[01:36:03.792 --> 01:36:09.796]  Excuse me, the EPA put out the report and said they've got huge amounts of particulates in their lungs.
[01:36:09.796 --> 01:36:17.582]  Of this, they're very sick, they need a fund, and George Bush blocked the fund to give medical treatment to the firemen and police.
[01:36:17.582 --> 01:36:20.604]  Forget the civilians, as they call us.
[01:36:20.604 --> 01:36:31.472]  So again, there's another example just of how they'll have all these tributes to you, all this sappiness on TV, crying and loving you and telling you what heroes you are, but they really don't care about you.
[01:36:31.912 --> 01:36:37.516]  Well, Christine Whitman actually altered the reports and all the contaminants that were involved there and where everybody got sick.
[01:36:37.516 --> 01:36:45.261]  I was a keynote speaker in an EPA conference with all the EPA headquarters in Cincinnati a year ago on all this stuff.
[01:36:45.261 --> 01:36:50.224]  It was right after that conference where all this stuff came out that Whitman got fired and stuff started coming out.
[01:36:50.224 --> 01:36:52.305]  So that's again a toxic wasteland.
[01:36:52.305 --> 01:36:53.026]  They don't care.
[01:36:53.999 --> 01:36:56.680]  I mean, it's just, it's mind-boggling.
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:59.920]  But again, what was it, $97 million?
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:03.481]  Which sounds like a lot, but it's not when you've got tens of thousands of police and firemen.
[01:37:03.481 --> 01:37:05.922]  And see, you didn't get it!
[01:37:05.922 --> 01:37:07.022]  You don't get anything!
[01:37:07.022 --> 01:37:12.924]  But you're going to pull me over and demand to search my car and act like a police state thug serving this system.
[01:37:12.924 --> 01:37:15.044]  It's stupid!
[01:37:15.044 --> 01:37:16.404]  Let's go, what do we got, another call?
[01:37:16.404 --> 01:37:18.165]  Yeah, let's go to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:37:18.165 --> 01:37:18.785]  Roger, go ahead.
[01:37:20.251 --> 01:37:21.051]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:37:21.051 --> 01:37:39.780]  Dr. Duggan, I wanted to ask, and I assume you're probably at least a little more ordinance expert than I am, which would be sufficient, but am I correct in my surmise that even if one believes in DU rounds, that they, say, in Bosnia and probably to a lesser extent even in, say, the Iraqi context,
[01:37:40.538 --> 01:37:47.781]  That probably less than something like 1-5% of the time would that round make a difference, not requiring a second round, etc.
[01:37:47.781 --> 01:37:50.503]  There's no very little reactive armor, etc.
[01:37:50.503 --> 01:37:53.144]  that would occasion the use of such a round.
[01:37:53.144 --> 01:37:54.644]  Is that about accurate?
[01:37:54.644 --> 01:37:56.585]  Well, let me put it even simpler than that.
[01:37:56.585 --> 01:38:00.287]  A standard heat round, high explosive, or .50 cal round is going to take out the equipment.
[01:38:00.959 --> 01:38:02.180]  We never found a reactive arm.
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:05.101]  We never found anything that couldn't be penetrated by 50 cal rounds.
[01:38:05.101 --> 01:38:06.402]  Well, how about that?
[01:38:06.402 --> 01:38:07.583]  God bless y'all.
[01:38:07.583 --> 01:38:08.563]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:38:08.563 --> 01:38:13.926]  I've seen them admit on television that they shoot buildings up, regular cars, buses.
[01:38:13.926 --> 01:38:16.107]  But we've got the actual measurements.
[01:38:16.107 --> 01:38:17.888]  We've got the actual photographic records.
[01:38:17.888 --> 01:38:18.969]  We've got the video records.
[01:38:19.489 --> 01:38:21.950]  I mean, I've got video footage of U.S.
[01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:31.435]  Army officers with all the contamination around, not putting their troops in protective gear, not putting it up, and just simply refusing to do anything with it, just leaving it there.
[01:38:31.435 --> 01:38:32.895]  There's no question about this.
[01:38:32.895 --> 01:38:36.277]  Why are they just using it all over Iraq and more and more munitions?
[01:38:36.277 --> 01:38:43.060]  I mean, before it was just the Abrams, Dart Brown, the Sabo Round, and in the Warthog, Vulcan Cannon.
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:46.662]  Why is it using so many other weapons now?
[01:38:46.662 --> 01:38:47.422]  Kills and destroys.
[01:38:48.857 --> 01:38:50.818]  This is a little curious thing.
[01:38:50.818 --> 01:38:51.459]  Well, here's a question.
[01:38:51.459 --> 01:38:54.600]  How many weapon systems that you know of is it being used in?
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:59.482]  Okay, we have it in the Abrams rounds, 105, 120 millimeter round.
[01:38:59.482 --> 01:39:00.143]  That's in the U.S.
[01:39:00.143 --> 01:39:00.723]  side.
[01:39:00.723 --> 01:39:02.344]  We have it in 30 millimeter.
[01:39:02.344 --> 01:39:06.445]  Each one of those are about 10 pounds solid uranium per round.
[01:39:06.445 --> 01:39:09.247]  The Bradley fighting vehicle uses a 25 millimeter round.
[01:39:09.247 --> 01:39:11.948]  That's about a half pound of solid uranium per round.
[01:39:12.611 --> 01:39:15.612]  The Warthog fire is a DU round.
[01:39:15.612 --> 01:39:19.154]  Each one's about three quarters of a pound of solid uranium per round.
[01:39:19.154 --> 01:39:20.955]  The fire's at 4,000 rounds per minute.
[01:39:20.955 --> 01:39:23.836]  That's a ton and a half per minute on target.
[01:39:23.836 --> 01:39:25.397]  Then we have the ATOM and the PETOM.
[01:39:25.397 --> 01:39:26.577]  Those are both submunitions.
[01:39:26.577 --> 01:39:27.698]  Those are land mines.
[01:39:27.698 --> 01:39:30.299]  Those are cluster bombs contained DU.
[01:39:30.299 --> 01:39:32.480]  Then we have it in the .50 cal machine gun.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.641]  Yeah, I'm glad that they're issuing it to everybody now.
[01:39:34.641 --> 01:39:39.743]  We have total confirmation on Abrams tank being taken out by a .50 cal DU round.
[01:39:39.743 --> 01:39:41.424]  Absolute total confirmation, not a question.
[01:39:42.365 --> 01:39:44.206]  Uh, then we have it in the bunker busters.
[01:39:44.206 --> 01:39:45.167]  Absolutely no doubt about it.
[01:39:45.167 --> 01:39:46.888]  We got it in the cruise missiles.
[01:39:46.888 --> 01:39:53.972]  You have to understand, this stuff is so effective that the warrior, when they go to war, or the guys that run the war, are going to use it.
[01:39:53.972 --> 01:40:01.877]  And the other thing, too, is we're getting rid of all of our radiological waste at Oak Ridge, in Tennessee, Portsmouth in Ohio, and Paducah, Kentucky.
[01:40:01.877 --> 01:40:06.100]  They can't dispose of it there, so what we'll do is dispose of it in another nation and walk away.
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:06.880]  Incredible.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:11.523]  I know we got a bunch of calls, but, uh, John, specifically for Dr. Rocky, who's up next?
[01:40:13.288 --> 01:40:20.752]  Okay, well, we've got callers calling in, but they're calling in about other issues, about Bohemian Grove, other issues, so we're not going to take calls on that folks.
[01:40:20.752 --> 01:40:26.615]  We're talking about depleting uranium here in just the last few minutes we've got with Dr. Rocky here at the end of the year.
[01:40:26.615 --> 01:40:34.059]  Dr. Rocky, I couldn't have thought of a more important broadcast to do at the end of the year, because if they'll do this, they'll do anything.
[01:40:34.059 --> 01:40:37.560]  I mean, what else are they doing that is killing our own people?
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:40.662]  I mean, what does this say about, in closing, the mindset of these people?
[01:40:41.283 --> 01:40:50.491]  Well, let's consider Project Shad is still an ongoing thing throughout the United States, where they've deliberately exposed chemical and biological munitions to our own troops, as they've done for years and years and years.
[01:40:50.491 --> 01:40:55.435]  I've had to clean that up, I've had to provide medical care for the casualties, and that continues on.
[01:40:55.435 --> 01:41:01.640]  The thing is, again, as we end this year, the United States has gone to war again.
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:07.485]  They have sent our sons and daughters into war with defective equipment, with inadequate training,
[01:41:08.146 --> 01:41:14.288]  into a contaminated area where we refuse to provide, clean up the contamination that we caused.
[01:41:14.288 --> 01:41:31.992]  We're leaving that contamination there to affect the residents of those areas and we've walked away and refused to provide medical care and now we've got another American warrior, a son, a son and daughter of America, son of America, who's died in Kansas City area, abandoned by his nation for which he gave his life for.
[01:41:31.992 --> 01:41:35.753]  Dr. Rocky, I'll see you in 2005, I want to get you back on about Project Shad.
[01:41:36.678 --> 01:41:37.679]  Thank you very much.
[01:41:37.679 --> 01:41:39.280]  Thank you for coming on.
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:41.981]  Hold on just one moment.
[01:41:41.981 --> 01:41:43.142]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:41:43.142 --> 01:41:45.303]  Hold on just a second.
[01:41:45.303 --> 01:41:49.826]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:41:49.826 --> 01:41:54.368]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:41:54.368 --> 01:41:58.791]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:41:58.791 --> 01:42:00.152]  The New World Order.
[01:42:01.914 --> 01:42:06.218]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:42:06.218 --> 01:42:13.266]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:42:13.266 --> 01:42:15.289]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:26.096]  Homeland Security, Executive Orders, Force Vaccinations, The New Prison Economy, The Total Information Society, The Pan-American Union, Federal Gun Grabs, Government Run, White Slavery Rings, and much, much more.
[01:42:26.096 --> 01:42:32.160]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:49.032]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:42:49.032 --> 01:42:54.736]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:42:54.736 --> 01:43:05.262]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:43:05.262 --> 01:43:09.604]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:43:09.804 --> 01:43:10.605]  We're good to go!
[01:43:24.773 --> 01:43:25.233]  We're good to go.
[01:43:46.041 --> 01:43:46.582]  We're good to go.
[01:44:01.363 --> 01:44:02.004]  We're good to go.

[01:44:49.807 --> 01:44:52.188]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:44:52.188 --> 01:44:58.612]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:44:58.612 --> 01:45:01.734]  Alright, you know, always the most important stuff gets said during breaks.
[01:45:01.734 --> 01:45:08.378]  You're talking to Dr. Rocky, you know, he's having upper respiratory problems right now, bleeding rashes from the DU right now!
[01:45:09.028 --> 01:45:13.492]  A lot of his team has died that was there in 1991, or are very ill.
[01:45:13.492 --> 01:45:21.198]  Finishing up, Dr. Rockey, during the break, we were talking about folks that go, oh, I trust the government, they wouldn't do that to me, and you had a comment to that.
[01:45:21.198 --> 01:45:37.892]  They're going to do it to you, and what I need to urge right now, it's been all over the news and everybody, I need to have every mother and father, son and daughter, niece and nephew, grandparent, aunt and uncle, call their congressmen, their senators, the President of the United States, call the Secretary of Defense,
[01:45:38.507 --> 01:45:54.136]  And absolutely ensure, mandate, that our sons and daughters are not sent to war with defective equipment, inadequate training, and a total lack of medical care assessment before they go to war, when they're in war, and medical care when they come back.
[01:45:54.136 --> 01:45:55.957]  But you know the cover-ups gotta continue.
[01:45:55.957 --> 01:45:57.078]  They can't let it out that they did.
[01:45:57.078 --> 01:45:58.619]  This is like all the other cover-ups.
[01:45:58.619 --> 01:46:02.901]  Well, yeah, but the whole thing is we have to have everybody that yells and screams at no more.
[01:46:02.901 --> 01:46:06.203]  One of the things that I've been doing... Well, it's also a good reason not to join the military.
[01:46:07.182 --> 01:46:15.269]  Well let me tell you, after 30 some years in the military as a retired disabled combat veteran right now, I wouldn't advise anybody to join the military from what I've learned.
[01:46:15.269 --> 01:46:18.832]  But what we have to do now, we have to take care of our sons and daughters.
[01:46:18.832 --> 01:46:28.260]  Everybody must call and take action to demand and ensure they have adequate training, the equipment they need, they get the medical care before, they get the medical care during and after.
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:30.842]  And they're not put in there with effective equipment.
[01:46:30.842 --> 01:46:34.746]  And this nonsense where Rumsfeld said, well you go to war with what you have is ridiculous.
[01:46:35.954 --> 01:46:41.077]  He has an obligation to ensure that our sons and daughters have the best equipment at all times.
[01:46:41.077 --> 01:46:44.758]  And when I hear words and I get back a message, send me a Christmas care package.
[01:46:44.758 --> 01:46:45.559]  Send me socks.
[01:46:45.559 --> 01:46:47.200]  Send me shoelaces.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:48.400]  Send me the simplest stuff.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:49.561]  Send me toilet paper.
[01:46:49.561 --> 01:46:53.603]  Did you know Halliburton charges them $100 for 10 pounds of laundry?
[01:46:53.603 --> 01:47:03.268]  Yeah, well, Halliburton has been ripping everybody off since I wrote the cleanup plan and gave it to Halliburton by the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, back in 92.
[01:47:03.268 --> 01:47:03.688]  What the heck?
[01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:13.052]  Listen, Dr. Rockey, have a good New Year and I want to get you back on soon about Project Shad, where they openly nerve gas and bio our troops and kill them and test it on them.
[01:47:13.052 --> 01:47:16.112]  I want to get you back on about that and God bless you and thanks for your courage.
[01:47:16.112 --> 01:47:18.813]  Thank you and God bless and Happy New Year to everybody.
[01:47:18.813 --> 01:47:25.714]  And to that family, we've got to take care of that family, but then we have to make sure our government takes care of all of the families.
[01:47:25.714 --> 01:47:27.474]  And stops what they're doing to begin with.
[01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:27.874]  Take care.
[01:47:27.874 --> 01:47:28.594]  Take care.
[01:47:28.594 --> 01:47:29.915]  Bye.
[01:47:29.915 --> 01:47:31.515]  Folks, I mean again,
[01:47:32.438 --> 01:47:38.599]  So many people think they're members of the establishment, you defend it like a bunch of bees or something, and it doesn't care about you.
[01:47:38.599 --> 01:47:39.860]  In fact, it hates you.
[01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:43.480]  The globalists have little contests about who's the most ruthless.
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:45.381]  Seriously, they do.
[01:47:45.381 --> 01:47:50.802]  It's a society of sickos that run the planet, and they want you to think you're part of it.
[01:47:50.802 --> 01:47:52.702]  You're not, folks.
[01:47:52.702 --> 01:47:53.362]  Okay?
[01:47:53.362 --> 01:47:55.543]  This broadcast is not radical.
[01:47:55.543 --> 01:47:57.243]  Mercury is not nutritious.
[01:47:57.243 --> 01:47:59.624]  Uranium is not good for you.
[01:47:59.624 --> 01:48:00.584]  This is true.
[01:48:00.584 --> 01:48:01.344]  This is real.
[01:48:02.037 --> 01:48:09.820]  The IMF and World Bank public documents now are how to make the world starve, how to take our pension funds, how to enslave us.
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:11.221]  It's about control!
[01:48:11.221 --> 01:48:13.562]  They're criminals!
[01:48:13.562 --> 01:48:27.988]  In this new year, 2005 coming up, we're probably going to see globalist terror attacks, bring in national drafts and police state, we're going to see the implementation of the National ID Card with the driver's license, we're going to see the new Freedom Initiative as they try to push that, more psychological testing and drugging,
[01:48:28.641 --> 01:48:31.304]  We have got to wake everybody up and say no.
[01:48:31.304 --> 01:48:33.386]  We've got to support those that tell the truth.
[01:48:33.386 --> 01:48:38.592]  We've all got to become info warriors and stand up against this new world order.
[01:48:38.592 --> 01:48:44.198]  The interview you heard with Dr. Rocky will re-air tonight, 9 to midnight central and several times over the weekend.
[01:48:44.198 --> 01:48:45.179]  Please tell your friends about it.
