[01:19.180 --> 01:24.660]  know I feel bad for Kevin Sorbo and the director of a new film that were scheduled to be on the
[01:24.660 --> 01:30.640]  show today we're having to move them because obviously this could trigger a much larger
[01:30.640 --> 01:37.720]  war and this this this mirrors the things that brought us into conflicts like world war one
[01:37.720 --> 01:44.320]  and world war two and we've been talking the last few years about the buildup towards a world
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.360]  war and the rank operation basically called for one three years ago to bring in the world
[01:49.360 --> 01:56.720]  government most mainline historians every week there's national international headlines about
[01:56.720 --> 02:03.680]  the world lining up for a new world war and that that being in the air and this being the season
[02:03.680 --> 02:15.440]  the season ladies and gentlemen it's not the season of love it is the season of global crises to
[02:15.440 --> 02:22.320]  destroy the old systems and on the ashes of it build a planetary tyranny Paul Watson is joining
[02:22.320 --> 02:28.720]  us coming up the next segment with analysis Obama and neocons get ball rolling on world war three
[02:29.440 --> 02:36.160]  video did Ukraine fabricate evidence to frame Russia for mh-17 shootdown killing over 300 people
[02:36.160 --> 02:43.520]  was flight mh-17 diverted over restricted airspace s0 hedge was the shootdown of the passenger jet
[02:43.520 --> 02:50.960]  over Ukraine a false flag Obama visits burger joint after Malaysian airline jet shot down says
[02:50.960 --> 02:57.360]  he's starving Pentagon official says russians likely responsible for shooting down Malaysian
[02:57.360 --> 03:05.040]  plane and yes it takes a more powerful missile but dozens and dozens of countries have missiles
[03:05.040 --> 03:14.080]  that go above 33,000 feet it was the impads around 15,000 other than only go up to about 15,000 feet
[03:14.640 --> 03:19.280]  that al-qaeda has been given they're perfect for shooting down passenger liners as they come in
[03:19.280 --> 03:26.000]  and the cities are go out of cities most aircraft don't get above 10,000 feet before they even get
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.040]  out of the city or you can just sit out a mile from the airport in the planes at 3000 feet and
[03:31.040 --> 03:36.320]  blow it out of the air that that's what you want to do because then it doesn't have time to recover
[03:36.320 --> 03:42.000]  if one of its engines gets blown if they're up higher sometimes they can recover and land from
[03:42.000 --> 03:51.920]  just one missile the point is that NATO has been caught staging false flags in Syria
[03:52.960 --> 03:59.360]  Sy Hirsch has come out and talked about how that was clearly staged as well months after we
[03:59.360 --> 04:06.240]  documented it but he's very respected two-time Pulitzer prize winner so my issue is this could
[04:06.240 --> 04:16.960]  be a false flag the way the Russians are acting though and putting out this information and things
[04:18.960 --> 04:26.400]  makes me begin to lead towards something even more complex now again mainstream media wants to
[04:26.400 --> 04:31.840]  dominate speculation everybody loves a good mystery especially if it could cause world war three
[04:31.840 --> 04:35.520]  they've got articles in the Daily Mail they've got articles in the Boston Globe they've got them
[04:35.520 --> 04:41.200]  everywhere criticizing myself and others we're simply saying who could be behind this that's
[04:41.200 --> 04:45.680]  heresy to have your own speculation you're supposed to just listen to them and listen
[04:45.680 --> 04:55.520]  to them speculate but when I come back I'm gonna tell you where the evidence is leaning right now
[04:55.520 --> 05:05.680]  in my view in my view hi i'm dr. Edward group it took me 20 years of searching the globe to find

[08:59.440 --> 09:05.520]  top that you'll need to be watching info wars dot com and prison planet dot com over the weekend
[09:05.520 --> 09:15.040]  for continued breaking video uh and text reports detailing what's happening worldwide from gaza to
[09:15.040 --> 09:20.800]  ukraine and the Crimea right through the rest of the middle east financially here in the u.s and world
[09:20.800 --> 09:29.280]  wide the globalists are triggering and moving on all fronts right now and this swarm effect
[09:30.160 --> 09:37.520]  is only engaged in before major world wars begin and that's why every major historian
[09:37.520 --> 09:44.640]  and worth their salt the vast majority are in the wall street journal new york times
[09:44.640 --> 09:52.480]  london guardian financial times of london this broadcast drugs report everywhere analysts are
[09:52.480 --> 10:02.480]  saying major global crises major war major currency collapse major and we've been telling
[10:02.480 --> 10:09.760]  you this for the last few years and you can feel the buildup right now i've got goosebumps on my
[10:09.760 --> 10:18.160]  face right now i'm getting chills right now when i get up here and talk about how grave and how dire
[10:19.280 --> 10:26.960]  the situation is and i'm not being melodramatic if we don't get upset about all this right now
[10:26.960 --> 10:34.320]  now if we don't get concerned about this and really get involved and try to de-escalate
[10:34.320 --> 10:44.000]  things the globalists are going to flog this into a war now here's what i know about mh17 the
[10:45.920 --> 10:56.080]  malaysian airliner that blew up right after 1400 gmt 50 miles from the russian border over
[10:56.080 --> 11:09.440]  crimia here's what i know the globalist stand to gain from all of this
[11:14.960 --> 11:20.720]  it comes on the cusp
[11:20.720 --> 11:30.240]  of israel completely destroying gaza israel 14 minutes in fact i have an article right here
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.560]  i noticed this morning i went and looked it up and others had pointed it out 14 minutes
[11:35.440 --> 11:40.400]  after the plane had been hit by the missile right as it was breaking in the news israel was
[11:40.400 --> 11:48.960]  lined up and launched a giant offensive into gaza coincidence and no i'm not saying israel
[11:48.960 --> 11:55.520]  was involved i'm saying they were given word by nato and others as their offensive lined up wait
[11:57.600 --> 12:02.080]  because it becomes a big distraction from what's happening near and more importantly from what
[12:02.080 --> 12:11.120]  isis is doing advancing all over the middle east in africa in in iraq in syria with western forces
[12:11.680 --> 12:17.200]  special forces confirmed even london guardian reports in there with them right now with medium
[12:17.200 --> 12:20.240]  weapons and high-tech weapons like stinger missiles that bring down aircraft
[12:23.680 --> 12:34.320]  so what i know is this this is extremely fortuitous and comes right at the perfect time for the
[12:34.320 --> 12:50.880]  globalist john mccain has come out in just hyper extreme rhetoric and said that they'll be hell
[12:50.880 --> 12:59.680]  to pay for the russians that's a u.s senator on the defense committee talking like a third world
[12:59.680 --> 13:07.840]  dictator trying to escalate the war rhetoric putin has blamed ukraine for loss of flight
[13:07.840 --> 13:16.400]  mh-17 with 298 innocent souls a dozen i russian separatists shot it down with missile as mccain
[13:16.400 --> 13:23.200]  warns there will be hell to pay also you had the bizarreness that it's the same making model of the
[13:23.200 --> 13:30.160]  other missing malaysian plane that that's really weird around 100 attendees heading to australian
[13:30.160 --> 13:36.320]  aids conference among victims of down malaysian airline flight we're looking into this top aids
[13:36.320 --> 13:42.640]  conference and i've seen intel that they were looking at aids being man-made which nobel laureates
[13:42.640 --> 13:49.280]  have already come out and said a bio weapon a race specific bio weapon developed for south africa
[13:49.280 --> 13:55.360]  who we know is working on it that's declassified they just didn't call it aids look it up that's
[13:55.360 --> 14:00.880]  mainstream times of london from the 80s that south africa got caught working on auto immune viruses
[14:00.880 --> 14:06.160]  that target africans by the way it's very hard for northern europeans to get aids they don't
[14:06.160 --> 14:10.640]  have the receptor sites in their t lymphocytes they can still get it if they've destroyed their
[14:10.640 --> 14:19.440]  immune system but it is designed to whack black people so this is good and again if the new york
[14:19.440 --> 14:25.760]  times or the daily mail or the boston globe who've all got articles going look at the conspiracy
[14:25.760 --> 14:31.360]  theorist saying it's a false flag and then quoting me yesterday saying we'll look at it and see if
[14:31.360 --> 14:39.680]  it's a false flag i don't know listen that is the dinosaur media attempting to say they have a monopoly
[14:39.680 --> 14:46.800]  on speculation when when no one knows except whoever did this exactly who's behind it and i
[14:46.800 --> 14:52.240]  said yesterday it could be the russians it could be the separatist it could be a friendly fire that
[14:52.240 --> 15:00.800]  happens in war but you look at everything else happening and everything else going on and who
[15:00.800 --> 15:05.920]  launched the war in ukraine months ago george soros the state department of all bragg day did it
[15:05.920 --> 15:12.480]  five billion dollars overthrowing the government the elected government putting in new people
[15:17.120 --> 15:21.840]  trying to start a war with russia the globalists are on the offensive they're the ones turning
[15:21.840 --> 15:26.400]  al qaeda and isis luce they're the ones overthrowing libya and all these other countries and invading
[15:26.400 --> 15:31.200]  iraq they're the ones handing out the heat seeking missiles they're the ones coming after our guns
[15:31.200 --> 15:35.680]  with executive orders they're the ones training for gun confiscation and buying thousands of armored
[15:35.680 --> 15:42.720]  vehicles and no hesitation sites you know targets of little kids and women they're the ones with
[15:42.720 --> 15:48.560]  obama announcing monday they're preparing the eas alert takeover system to take over the whole
[15:48.560 --> 15:54.800]  media and the internet kills which is now operable that was announced on monday and i said folks they
[15:54.800 --> 15:59.680]  don't announce it unless they're thinking about using it and i got chills on monday i think it
[15:59.680 --> 16:05.680]  chills maybe once a year talking about something i'm getting them every minute now i mean again
[16:05.680 --> 16:14.240]  my instincts and my intellectual understanding is is just burning with we're all in danger my
[16:14.240 --> 16:20.480]  children are in danger your children are in danger the culture is in danger society is in
[16:20.480 --> 16:27.360]  danger the globalists have the hardened bunkers they have the cog continue government they believe
[16:27.360 --> 16:32.640]  a world government will bring them in to total power
[16:35.760 --> 16:40.800]  they want a crisis to end the status quo of due process and freedom
[16:40.800 --> 16:44.160]  hall watson's coming up for the balance of the hour after the break but
[16:45.360 --> 16:51.680]  here's what i said yesterday and and zero hedge is reporting on it today this morning
[16:51.680 --> 17:00.800]  and then cbs news and the san francisco chronicle and others came out in just the last hour and
[17:01.600 --> 17:06.720]  acted like rational human beings and of course maybe they'll have the new york times calling
[17:06.720 --> 17:11.520]  conspiracy theorist because they asked real questions they'll call it a theory no there's
[17:11.520 --> 17:18.320]  no theory that this is a war zone there's no theory that it's a provocation and we're sad that 302
[17:18.320 --> 17:24.320]  people or whatever it was 298 now it's 300 something or dead but do you want that to be the pretext
[17:24.320 --> 17:31.040]  of a war that could kill millions or billions the russians have no motive to want to shoot down a
[17:31.040 --> 17:43.200]  third party 777 jumbo jet the globalists stand again so i look at this and then i see this headline
[17:43.200 --> 17:48.400]  zero hedge info wars dot com we could put the graphic up on screen for tv viewers it's up on
[17:48.400 --> 17:55.840]  info wars dot com was flight mh 17 diverted over restricted airspace i love how they call zero
[17:55.840 --> 18:03.280]  hedge that are run by insider billionaire folks who will not go named in wall street who don't
[18:03.280 --> 18:08.240]  like the new world order and who don't like nuclear war they said that early this morning
[18:08.240 --> 18:13.040]  at about 4 a.m when i woke up that article was out on info wars dot com because watch in six hours i
[18:13.040 --> 18:20.160]  hadn't even already posted it they said it then hours later captain schellenberger big question cbs
[18:20.160 --> 18:27.840]  is why plane was flying over war zone and why the european f a a f a a is over there as well
[18:27.840 --> 18:35.600]  and why the e u air traffic system didn't announce months ago a warning and a no fly through that
[18:35.600 --> 18:43.920]  crime a corridor now we're being attacked and zero hedge is being attacked i've got articles right
[18:43.920 --> 18:51.120]  here already today saying that we claim they flew it over a war zone no we didn't claim jack squad
[18:51.120 --> 18:57.520]  and the controlled corporate press the state-run media doesn't control reality anymore like carl
[18:57.520 --> 19:04.640]  rove bragged you did back in 2005 in the new york times okay that is a war zone the plane flew
[19:04.640 --> 19:10.800]  over an area where they have been restricting flights in ukraine and not letting them fly over
[19:10.800 --> 19:20.080]  they were supposed to fly 60 miles to the south and instead they flew right over the war zone
[19:20.080 --> 19:30.240]  they were directed by ukrainian air traffic control to fly over that and again i don't
[19:30.240 --> 19:37.680]  have a dog in this fight i care about the catholic ukranians in the west and who've got real beast
[19:37.680 --> 19:43.120]  with russia i care about the russian slavic ukranians in the east who've got real beefs with
[19:43.120 --> 19:49.760]  what the western ukranians did with the nazis it's tribal warfare pride and i don't want it to
[19:49.760 --> 19:56.240]  cause world war three for a bunch of globalists so that's the bottom line it's a war zone it's a

[24:21.200 --> 24:25.840]  it was admitted a month ago that no one was supposed to fly over that airspace
[24:25.840 --> 24:31.040]  because it was a registered war zone in europe so actually europe it said do not fly with that area
[24:31.040 --> 24:38.560]  no one had been flying over that area there were scores of flights just that day that were routed
[24:38.560 --> 24:50.720]  around that only that flight was sent into the war zone now continuing ladies and gentlemen
[24:51.760 --> 24:54.000]  with the information that we're breaking down
[24:54.000 --> 25:03.920]  no one stands to gain from this but the globalist it is entirely possible that uh russian backed
[25:03.920 --> 25:12.000]  rebels who have been given the sam type missiles that can shoot down a high flying aircraft
[25:12.000 --> 25:24.560]  left mistaken it and did shoot it down that could be true the issue here is that they within minutes
[25:24.560 --> 25:32.960]  of the plane being shot down it was already being announced by members of the state department
[25:32.960 --> 25:37.520]  and and their alumni like strobe talbot and hillary clinton and others that russia was
[25:37.520 --> 25:43.120]  clearly behind it and the rebels had done it and look here's a tweet they deleted these are famous
[25:43.120 --> 25:50.160]  liars so i don't by default just believe whatever they say here is boston dot com the boston globe
[25:50.160 --> 25:56.640]  the weirdest conspiracy theories surrounding the malaysian airlines flight mh 17 and they mix
[25:56.640 --> 26:03.840]  legitimate questioning of is it a false flag did the russians do it is it connected to the other
[26:03.840 --> 26:08.320]  missing malaysian flight is it connected to the age scientist that's what you do that's what police
[26:08.320 --> 26:12.160]  do an investigation when they come to a murder scene they start looking and speculating and
[26:12.160 --> 26:21.920]  wargaming info that's normal investigation that's normal thought process and they say no that's
[26:21.920 --> 26:28.880]  unconsure that's insane your nuts alex jones look what people say on his website and they show
[26:28.880 --> 26:37.200]  no people in the comment section saying things and imply i said it so again that's the attempt
[26:37.200 --> 26:42.960]  to control reality look at drudge report dot com it has an image right now of latimer putin on it
[26:44.000 --> 26:50.400]  and it says who shot it down that's a normal question to ask and that's what you should
[26:50.400 --> 26:59.840]  be asking well only the boston globe only the new york times can ask who shot it down and it
[26:59.840 --> 27:07.040]  is a link to the new york times see drudge is so smart he knows at first dare not even question
[27:07.040 --> 27:16.640]  who shot it down because only again mainstream media is proper and kosher and acceptable or
[27:16.640 --> 27:23.440]  bonafide to and i mean a little bit tongue in cheek here but but the point is the new york times
[27:24.400 --> 27:30.880]  is allowed to say who shot it down but we said yesterday who shot it down let's look at different
[27:30.880 --> 27:35.920]  angles of it that's not allowed according to the daily mail and according to the boston globe
[27:35.920 --> 27:40.640]  and according to a bunch of other publications time magazine you name it there are people all
[27:40.640 --> 27:45.760]  over radio right now today i'm getting the emails and the clips are being sent to us saying that i
[27:45.760 --> 27:51.840]  said the u.s. government did this or i said nato did this when all i said is nato stands to gain
[27:51.840 --> 27:56.720]  from this and they're known liars who stage false flags and who staged chemical attacks this year
[27:56.720 --> 28:05.040]  and last year with saudi arabia against syria to then blame Assad they even attacked Assad's own
[28:05.040 --> 28:12.640]  people but still tried to blame it on Assad and i'm not lionizing Assad Assad didn't do it and it
[28:12.640 --> 28:20.320]  came out even in the bbc and the turkish papers had to admit that it was staged so if they will
[28:20.320 --> 28:27.520]  stage chemical attacks killing hundreds would they do this or do stuff like put a transponder
[28:27.520 --> 28:34.000]  coding in on the malaysian aircraft designated in that airspace as a ukrainian military aircraft
[28:34.000 --> 28:40.400]  or undesignated as a civilian aircraft so the russians would then say okay they've been using
[28:40.400 --> 28:44.800]  bombers to bomb people killing thousands in the last few weeks that's the ukrainian government's
[28:44.800 --> 28:51.040]  own statement the russian said they'd strike back so maybe they coded it the ukrainians or nato
[28:51.040 --> 28:58.800]  who control the air traffic control in that area maybe they coded it as a ukrainian or nato bomber
[28:58.800 --> 29:04.720]  and the russians shot it down that's classic false flag folks you go commit atrocity blame somebody
[29:04.720 --> 29:09.360]  else or you mark your ship like another country and then have it attacked so then bring another
[29:09.360 --> 29:15.280]  country into the war this is what governments do this is how they operate this is what they've
[29:15.280 --> 29:21.760]  done for thousands of years and i'm simply saying if we have known governments that do this more than
[29:21.760 --> 29:27.520]  anybody i've ever heard of should we look at it as a false flag paul watson's coming up david night
[29:27.520 --> 29:35.280]  in studio to give us his breakdown straight ahead but this is a big deal this only hurts the russians
[29:35.280 --> 29:41.120]  it only hurts poot and i'm not signing with the russians or citing you know citing with them
[29:42.880 --> 29:49.200]  i'm simply trying to stop world war three i simply want stability not a new war we're on the march

[34:24.480 --> 34:29.440]  next war if there's one thing that has unified democrats and republicans that everybody in
[34:29.440 --> 34:34.800]  between is that we all hate at the bank bailout the department of homeland security is apparently on
[34:34.800 --> 34:42.880]  a huge ammo buying spree it comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition today it is infinitely

[35:13.840 --> 35:21.440]  host of info wars nightly news is with us paul watson joins us from london england and he's
[35:21.440 --> 35:27.040]  been following this throughout the night and this morning not even sleeping it was first
[35:27.040 --> 35:32.560]  basically pointed out by the german media then picked up by zero hedge and now cbs news
[35:32.560 --> 35:39.680]  is saying why was plane flying over war zone when all other air traffic for months has been
[35:39.680 --> 35:47.280]  directed out of the area this was the sole plane directed on its flight plan the malaysian doomed
[35:47.280 --> 35:53.120]  flight so the big issue and it's finally starting to get some traction which is good it can stop a
[35:53.120 --> 36:02.080]  larger war is why was it directed over the war zone it isn't even about who shot it down and then
[36:02.080 --> 36:11.920]  there's this kind of raw raw ford versus chevy coke versus pepsi redskins versus the cowboys idea
[36:11.920 --> 36:18.800]  that i see in the comments on youtube and info wars dot com going come on traders get behind a war
[36:18.800 --> 36:23.920]  let's have war with russia let's let's have a war let's hey they got nuclear weapons folks
[36:25.280 --> 36:28.960]  all these arab countries whether you love israel or hate israel or neutral
[36:28.960 --> 36:34.080]  that say we're going to push into the sea and blow you up israel's got 800 nuclear weapons
[36:34.080 --> 36:40.960]  you're not going to do anything same thing with russia you know what my interests are the truth
[36:40.960 --> 36:46.080]  and my kids not being a nuclear war or gas prices not being five dollars a gallon they're racing up
[36:46.080 --> 36:51.120]  right now or christians and innocent muslims being murder ball kaita and isis everywhere
[36:51.760 --> 36:56.640]  or saudi arabia caught red handy launching chemical attacks on a saw a deblame it on him
[36:56.640 --> 37:02.560]  that came out main stream news after we broke it and world net daily broke it and drugs report
[37:02.560 --> 37:07.840]  dot com carried our stories it came out later months later that that indeed happened but no one
[37:07.840 --> 37:14.880]  remembers it because the admission is in the back of the paper oh bbc yeah that was you know
[37:15.520 --> 37:22.640]  saudi arabia and turkey and nato stage three chemical attacks the un even admitted it i mean
[37:22.640 --> 37:29.520]  that's a bomb shell so of course i look at this and say is nato involved but i got to tell you
[37:29.520 --> 37:34.320]  nato may not have been involved in the way we think it's kind of like telling a two-year-old go
[37:34.320 --> 37:40.080]  playing traffic did you kill the two-year-old no you told him there's like a yosemite sam episode
[37:40.080 --> 37:44.800]  that's politically incorrect so it's been banned off tv used to be on youtube where he goes and marries
[37:44.800 --> 37:49.120]  are rich widow he doesn't know she's got this giant son who he's got to take care of and carry
[37:49.120 --> 37:54.000]  around his back it's called x marks the spot and he sits there and goes now go play fetch and he
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.880]  throws the ball out in the street you know so the giant two-year-old you go out and get run over
[37:58.880 --> 38:03.760]  but instead it's you somebody sam that gets run over and he hasn't you know jumping a pool full
[38:03.760 --> 38:09.920]  of alligators and you'll go swimming went worth okay daddy and that's basically it that you know
[38:09.920 --> 38:15.520]  they know the malaysian airline doesn't know it just gets directed by the nato run f a a system
[38:15.520 --> 38:22.720]  f a a's over there over nato and they just run him right into there or they could have changed the
[38:22.720 --> 38:28.960]  transponder anything bottom line what a police look at in all criminology developed in england
[38:28.960 --> 38:36.320]  300 years ago scotland yard the model of modern policing you look at who stands to gain the motive
[38:36.320 --> 38:43.600]  then you look at the means you look at the capacity to be able to actually carry it out then you look
[38:43.600 --> 38:50.560]  for the evidence of who the most likely suspect is and surprise a prize to quote golmer pile
[38:50.560 --> 38:57.440]  to sarge nine times out of ten it's who has the motive that's all i'm saying and there's a good
[38:57.440 --> 39:01.680]  chance the russians actually shot this down because it's they said a week ago all right you
[39:01.680 --> 39:06.320]  killed thousands of people the last week you crane brags they did it you're blowing up whole cities
[39:06.320 --> 39:11.760]  you're bombing schoolyards you're blowing up churches we're going to have targeted responses
[39:11.760 --> 39:16.720]  to it and they went really we're going to start directing airlines right over the zone
[39:18.640 --> 39:25.360]  who is to blame and again if if if russia it turns out premeditatedly wanted to shoot down
[39:25.360 --> 39:30.400]  a jet airliner so that putin looked really bad and so russia got sanctions put on them
[39:30.400 --> 39:36.320]  so that they can have world war three i will decry russia but you're like that doesn't make
[39:36.320 --> 39:43.280]  any sense why would it exactly ladies and gentlemen exactly they don't have a motive now in the next
[39:43.280 --> 39:48.240]  hour we do have sorbo coming on them for ten minutes talk about his film which is very interesting
[39:48.240 --> 39:51.440]  you know he was the guy that played hercules and the rest of it very interesting new liberty
[39:51.440 --> 39:56.480]  film he's in but then after that it's going to be open phones open phones right through that hour
[39:56.480 --> 40:01.120]  to give us your take on this and then catherine albert is set to be in studio with us we'll cover
[40:01.120 --> 40:06.640]  the waterfront with her but david night we're going to go to you in a moment with the proof of
[40:06.640 --> 40:12.400]  what i was just saying with the f a a announcements directing us aircraft not to go anywhere in the
[40:12.400 --> 40:17.360]  cramia but we also have a european advisory from over a month ago so we're not just going to say
[40:17.360 --> 40:22.160]  that we're going to prove it because even cbs is like why were they flying there no no no no
[40:22.160 --> 40:28.480]  that's not that's part of the question the big enchilada is why were they told to fly over it
[40:28.480 --> 40:34.480]  when the directive to everyone else was for months don't do it see they don't want you
[40:34.480 --> 40:40.240]  looking at that and i'll get the emails in the comments why do you like Putin never been to
[40:40.240 --> 40:45.280]  russia i'm not i don't have any slovic blood i'd be proud of it if i was very smart you know
[40:45.280 --> 40:51.040]  engineers smart people i mean great classical music very interesting culture i don't have
[40:51.040 --> 40:56.480]  any slovic blood in me that i know of okay folks but here's the deal i don't want to have world war
[40:56.480 --> 41:00.720]  three with them i just don't know how to explain that to you i guess it's i'm an extremist i'm a
[41:00.720 --> 41:05.920]  bad person i i you know i don't like george soros bragging a month ago that he ran the whole
[41:05.920 --> 41:12.320]  operation and putting nazis in to overthrow things uh so people like but putin's bad whatever
[41:13.120 --> 41:17.040]  i'm sure qaddafi wasn't good either is al qaeda better no they're 10 times worse
[41:18.160 --> 41:23.920]  the globalists are the ones on the march folks so i'm on the march trying to foil
[41:23.920 --> 41:29.040]  destabilization of our world because i want prosperity i don't want cloward and pevin i
[41:29.040 --> 41:34.320]  don't want agenda 21 i'm sorry i called the guys in and i'm ranting paul watson joining us from england
[41:34.320 --> 41:37.520]  i know you're gonna be writing an article soon that no one's picked up on the david night pointed
[41:37.520 --> 41:42.960]  out ukraine already shot down a passenger liner but none of this has gotten any coverage it was
[41:42.960 --> 41:48.000]  years ago but when they did it it didn't try to start world war three and back then it was a western
[41:48.000 --> 41:54.800]  back government but paul watson what do you have for us joining us from london well that's right
[41:54.800 --> 41:59.920]  i like to mean you look at the history 2001 ukraine admitted it shot down a russian airliner
[41:59.920 --> 42:08.320]  killed 78 people but you know you can go back even further i mean which country has planned to shoot
[42:08.320 --> 42:14.800]  down commercial airliners to blame on other countries to start wars 1962 operation northwards
[42:14.800 --> 42:19.440]  quote is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly the cuban aircraft has
[42:19.440 --> 42:25.040]  attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner enroute from the united states so they planned it
[42:25.040 --> 42:35.840]  then 2003 downing street memo the u.s had a plan to paint up a u.s military plane in un colors
[42:35.840 --> 42:43.520]  fly it over iraq get iraq to shoot it down as a pretext for the invasion of iraq and as he said
[42:43.520 --> 42:48.880]  2001 ukraine admitted that it shot down this russian airliner so the history proves that
[42:48.880 --> 42:55.760]  the only people who've actually plotted to do this as a kasas belly as a false flag to start a war
[42:55.760 --> 43:03.600]  is the united states and nato as you were talking about before july 8 10 days ago ukraine state
[43:03.600 --> 43:10.320]  aviation service banned all flights over this very same region rerouted them around the region
[43:10.320 --> 43:17.360]  in the previous 10 days to this incident malaysian airlines flight 17 avoided this very area
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.440]  the one day it didn't was yesterday and the maps are in the video that's on info wars.com that
[43:23.440 --> 43:28.160]  I put out this oh my gosh print that i had forgotten about the 2006 february 2nd article
[43:28.880 --> 43:34.320]  where bush and blair planned to get a u.s aircraft or un aircraft shot down to blame
[43:34.320 --> 43:42.000]  uh sedam or to blame others i mean they've done this over and over again bush blair 2003 iraq memo
[43:42.000 --> 43:48.080]  they wanted to get again a u2 spy plane shot down in un colors as a pretext for invasion
[43:48.640 --> 43:54.480]  we got to go with the headline u.s plan to uh get you know to use aircraft shoot down to start war
[43:54.480 --> 43:58.960]  i mean it's just they just do it over and over again paul but we're not according to the boston
[43:58.960 --> 44:04.720]  globe we're not supposed to question anything we're just supposed to believe whatever they say
[44:05.600 --> 44:09.680]  well they always try and seize the narrative immediately the mainstream media and then anybody
[44:09.680 --> 44:14.800]  else that has any speculation whatsoever they're bad they're evil another aspect which is interesting
[44:14.800 --> 44:21.760]  is there were panicked tweets from this um civil aviation this air controller who was in the tower
[44:21.760 --> 44:28.880]  at kiev boris ball airport when this incident went down and he claimed again this is not confirmed but
[44:28.880 --> 44:35.520]  he said three minutes before the the radar tower lost contact with the malaysian airlines plane
[44:35.520 --> 44:41.840]  it had ukrainian fighter jets surrounding it he says that kiev shot it down he said there were people
[44:42.480 --> 44:47.120]  kiev authorities immediately rushed up to the control tower basically threatened them all
[44:47.120 --> 44:52.240]  told them to shut up he was panicking tweeting all this out of course his twitter account's been
[44:52.240 --> 44:58.400]  shut down but he was in the actual control tower saying this is kiev that shot shot the plane down
[44:58.400 --> 45:04.320]  they're threatening as they're threatening us and then he went and who controls twitter but the cia
[45:04.320 --> 45:09.680]  and the state department on record with the library of congress and notice they were in the
[45:09.680 --> 45:16.800]  headline monday saying we don't want to let isis be kicked off twitter let them recruit on there
[45:16.800 --> 45:24.000]  so isis with all these heat seeking missiles is allowed to be on twitter but the people in ukraine
[45:24.000 --> 45:29.040]  who are reporting what happened they're not allowed to be and the other issue alex is
[45:30.560 --> 45:34.800]  us says evidence points to pro russia's hypothesis in destruction of malaysian plane it's new york
[45:34.800 --> 45:40.080]  times headline so now they're saying that these rebels had access to the book missile system which
[45:40.080 --> 45:45.520]  is the only missile system in that region that could have shot down this plane that's not what
[45:45.520 --> 45:51.680]  ukraine's prosecutor general said immediately after the incident according to the bbc the military
[45:51.680 --> 45:56.320]  the ukrainian military told the president after the passenger plane had been shot down that the
[45:56.320 --> 46:04.080]  terrorist did not possess our bolt missile systems so this whole premise is based around the notion
[46:04.080 --> 46:09.760]  that these separatists had access to this sophisticated radar missile system ukraine's own
[46:09.760 --> 46:16.400]  prosecutor general said today the military told the president the ukrainian president the separatists
[46:16.400 --> 46:21.360]  did not have access to this missile and let's expand on that only the russian government had it and
[46:21.360 --> 46:27.280]  the ukraine government had it back when they were russian allies but similar surface to air
[46:27.280 --> 46:34.960]  sands that go above 30 000 feet have been around since the 50s and in the u.s and in russia and
[46:34.960 --> 46:42.320]  it's just a fact uh that our fighter pilots in vietnam dealt with this from 64 on and that these
[46:42.320 --> 46:48.320]  weapons systems have been sold to everybody i mean every major state has these so to claim
[46:48.320 --> 46:54.960]  that only russia had this and so it must be russia is just pure bull the fact that russia has had a
[46:54.960 --> 47:01.280]  denial but i don't think a strong enough denial uh makes me think they might have been fooled into
[47:01.280 --> 47:06.480]  shooting it down i'm not saying that because i don't think we know enough yet but the fact that
[47:07.200 --> 47:13.440]  they were not allowed to fly through that area under european f a a and e u controls and now this
[47:13.440 --> 47:19.360]  lone aircraft did and this comes on the heels of the escalation i think it's very suspicious
[47:19.360 --> 47:24.320]  well i'm going to come back to you paul watson i know you've got more but this is really big uh
[47:25.040 --> 47:30.880]  let's detail the actual sources on this from the e u and the f a a on the bands that took place in
[47:30.880 --> 47:37.040]  last few months in that sector where this plane was directed to fly alex the f a a put out a
[47:37.040 --> 47:41.760]  statement of press release today reminding people that back on april third and we covered this last
[47:41.760 --> 47:44.800]  night in the nightly news i mean we already knew this we covered it last night but they
[47:44.800 --> 47:50.640]  reinforced it today saying back on april third the f a a issued a notice to airmen and what that
[47:50.640 --> 47:56.320]  notice is i've got the notice right here it is a special federal aviation regulation prohibiting
[47:56.320 --> 48:01.920]  all aircraft u.s aircraft u.s commercial operators from entering that space anybody that has a
[48:01.920 --> 48:08.080]  certificate issued by the f a a and all operators of any u.s registered aircraft the only exceptions
[48:08.080 --> 48:13.120]  they give of course are to u.s government sponsored operations and activities but basically this is
[48:13.120 --> 48:18.800]  a blanket prohibition and at the same time the un did the same thing through the international
[48:18.800 --> 48:24.880]  civil aviation organization on april third they also warned all airlines to avoid that area now
[48:24.880 --> 48:28.640]  we covered this last night and one of the things that you guys are just talking about the uh book
[48:28.640 --> 48:33.600]  mistletoe it was an order i mean you lose your license if you fly over where they say it's a
[48:33.600 --> 48:38.400]  regular ads a pilot yeah i mean we'd be coming up against huge deadly storms he'd have to land
[48:38.400 --> 48:43.040]  at some airfield because he couldn't go around the storm and couldn't fly over a military base
[48:43.040 --> 48:48.880]  i mean you don't fly over these designated areas that's right it's a regulation it's a prohibition
[48:48.880 --> 48:53.280]  now one of the things we're talking about this missile system uh remember that back in october
[48:53.280 --> 48:58.480]  2001 when the ukrainian government actually did shoot down an airliner they said it was by mistake
[48:58.480 --> 49:03.840]  because they were having naval operations very similar actually to twa flight 800 what people
[49:03.840 --> 49:07.200]  believe happened with that and even though we covered this last night even though there were
[49:07.200 --> 49:12.240]  over 750 eyewitnesses to that attack including pilots people on the ground said they saw a missile
[49:12.240 --> 49:16.560]  the cia and the fbi went around and confiscated all that information well it was about a year ago
[49:16.560 --> 49:21.440]  that this all surfaced on the news because that documentary came out about that and actually uh
[49:21.440 --> 49:26.880]  anderson cooper on cnn had said you know this is the one year uh this is the anniversary it's actually
[49:26.880 --> 49:33.040]  was in 1996 but it was on july 17th that the twa flight 800 was shot down he said that and then he
[49:33.040 --> 49:36.960]  had to do a retraction so we played that retraction said no no no i i didn't mean to say it was shot
[49:36.960 --> 49:41.760]  down actually the uh the fuel tank blew up and that caused it to blow up and by the way mainline
[49:41.760 --> 49:46.480]  reporters snuck in tested it was hit by continuous rod warhead his general partner developed the
[49:46.480 --> 49:52.160]  weapon set on my show back at the time oh yeah and uh it's well known that that aircraft was blown up
[49:52.160 --> 49:59.040]  during a naval drill yeah and they had over a thousand men and women on helicopters and ships
[49:59.040 --> 50:04.880]  who they had to gag in the military yes it was a multi it wasn't just navy involved who saw
[50:05.600 --> 50:12.080]  multiple missile trails yes yes i mean they blew the plane up in front of thousands and you've got
[50:12.080 --> 50:16.480]  and you've got national traffic safety and investigators said that they were lied to
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.800]  by the fbi you got others who said that they got evidence that there were but you're not
[50:20.800 --> 50:23.680]  supposed to question that you're i mean it doesn't matter if the people on the ships and the
[50:23.680 --> 50:27.680]  helicopters all saw it it doesn't matter if general parton said that you know they saw the photos
[50:27.680 --> 50:32.480]  of the reconstructed plane it was a you could see where the missile hit yes yes but that was done
[50:32.480 --> 50:37.040]  with a different kind of missile they don't need to have a book missile that was done with an ss 20
[50:37.040 --> 50:42.400]  no no only last night missiles yeah only about that on cnn they kept showing all the stats about
[50:42.400 --> 50:48.480]  it all yeah only russia can shoot down aircraft that's right no one else right no one not england
[50:48.480 --> 50:55.760]  not france not the us not japan not china not south africa not al-qaeda only russia can shoot

[55:45.120 --> 55:51.520]  this is John Busey today on Fox News with the from the Wall Street Journal managing editor
[55:52.080 --> 55:58.320]  on Fox saying Americans will thank the NSA now because they record all the phone calls
[55:58.320 --> 56:02.640]  I thought that wasn't the case and they'll find out who really did this you mean plant whatever
[56:02.640 --> 56:08.480]  they want I mean they plant DNA on people all the time DNA isn't proof of jack diddly squad
[56:08.480 --> 56:16.480]  when the system's run by evil people so here's the Orwellian clip of now the omnipresent state
[56:17.040 --> 56:24.080]  will solve everything for you the people caught staging the chemical attacks in Syria and saying
[56:24.080 --> 56:29.440]  only the Syrians had these chemicals and it turned out it was Saudi Arabia let's go to this clip
[56:29.440 --> 56:35.840]  that's that's the latest data points at the end of the day this is the time where the where the
[56:35.840 --> 56:39.920]  citizens around the world are going to be very happy for the NSA because they're going to be
[56:39.920 --> 56:44.800]  scarfing up these telephone calls they're going to be able to analyze this data they'll be able
[56:44.800 --> 56:50.800]  to determine most likely some of the communications that went on after the crash happened which will
[56:50.800 --> 56:57.120]  probably clarify the picture in the days to come they're going to be scarfing it up how do they
[56:57.120 --> 57:06.880]  do that no no no they record it live basically everything okay all right let's just get that
[57:06.880 --> 57:10.800]  straight Paul Watson other points we got one more segment with you and David aren't coming up but
[57:10.800 --> 57:15.200]  other points you haven't gotten to yet with your cutting edge analysis at prismplanet.com
[57:16.000 --> 57:21.600]  well just to put it into context this incident occurred literally two days after Putin and
[57:21.600 --> 57:27.120]  the rest of the BRICS countries announced basically the birth of this alternative to the IMF and the
[57:27.120 --> 57:34.240]  World Bank this anti-dollar alliance which directly threatens the unipolar world led by the US and
[57:34.240 --> 57:41.200]  NATO the new world order it also arrives a day after literally 24 hours after the Ukrainian
[57:41.200 --> 57:46.560]  forces in that very region were absolutely getting their hind end and kicked by these
[57:46.560 --> 57:52.400]  separatist rebels suffering huge heavy casualties and they have this convenient incident and of
[57:52.400 --> 57:57.200]  course the sanctions against Russia have been a complete failure the Russian stock market
[57:57.200 --> 58:03.680]  has skyrocketed in recent weeks as the US stock market has tailed off so in terms of qui bono
[58:03.680 --> 58:10.000]  I mean all the all the motivation all the momentum was going towards Russia getting the upper hand

[59:52.160 --> 59:57.360]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[59:57.360 --> 01:00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:21.440]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:32.160]  ladies and gentlemen if i sound excited it's because i am as paul watson just devastatingly
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.080]  put it and we need to go with those headlines explains the people there's nobody else will it
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:43.840]  change days after the world moves away from the dollar predictively just like they attacked iraq
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:48.800]  when they tried to leave the dollar they have sent this airliner right to the war zone it's been
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:55.360]  shot down and within minutes or saying the russians were behind it state department officials
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:02.400]  and again it's a tragedy anyway you slice it but the russians don't have the motive the key bono
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:07.040]  who benefits uh i want to get david night's take on that and more from paul watson
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:13.360]  david night well i'd say it exactly alex it looks so much to me like what happened just a
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.600]  year ago when they were pushing for a war with syria they said that they immediately knew when
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:23.200]  that gas attack occurred they immediately knew it's sarin only Assad has sarin therefore he
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.280]  did the attack we need to go after him now and it turned out that wasn't true it turned out
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.320]  that needs to come out and say you guys pulled false flags all over the world have a list with
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:38.800]  a big blow-up deal on the screen and do a newscast and it will defeat the globalist i mean again
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:43.600]  people don't the governments think the public's too ignorant for this no they're not too ignorant
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.320]  russia either shows all the cards or this could start world war three don't you agree
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.120]  should the budin just come out and just say look knock it off absolutely and and if they
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:58.000]  tricked the russians into shooting it down the russians need to come out and say that well
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.760]  you know they they immediately had this rocket this this surface air missile system the buk system
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:09.840]  and as wassen pointed out in 2001 october 2001 the ukraine had already shot down a passenger
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.160]  airline they said it was by mistake but it was a different missile and what they were pushing on
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.800]  cnn especially they were saying well the rebels have this buk missile system they stole it from
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.840]  the ukrainian government so therefore they're the ones who shot it down it's like well if they
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:25.600]  stole it from the ukrainian government obviously the ukrainian government has other ones but that
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.080]  what's ridiculous is i saw that too yesterday here around the office they just kept saying here's
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.880]  the missile here's the missile like the public's dumb look it's a missile look it's what did you
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:40.240]  see it see it russians have them it's like saying look here's a photo of alice with a gun you
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:44.960]  in the shooting range he might have killed people that is that's right and we should remember what
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.880]  happened last year with the sarin gas what eventually turned out we pointed out that
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.600]  that previously a few months earlier the un and the russian government had done an investigation
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:58.160]  saying that the sarin gas there was a form of homemade sarin gas that had been used
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:02.160]  by the rebels so it wasn't something that only the Assad government had it could have been done by
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:09.040]  either side so it wasn't a smoking gun and then as that started to get uh coverage the US government
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:14.720]  released its own analysis and that's when it ended it and that's exactly what Putin should do he
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.360]  should release the and turned out at one stage Saudi arabian exactly and then turkey was involved
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.720]  all right paul watchman got a minute and a half left uh i know you're working on a lot of big
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:29.280]  stories right now at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com what else is coming up well another
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.800]  major issue is the fact that within an hour of this shootdown taking place ukraine came out and said
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:39.520]  we've got bombshell evidence that implicates the russian government and so people were asking okay
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:45.520]  what have you got you know radar recording satellite imagery turns out they've got a youtube video
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:50.960]  which is this alleged separatist commander speaking with a leader of the russian armed forces
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:56.400]  basically admitting that they shot down the airliner problem is the ukrainians had already
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:02.240]  intercepted communications from the same people allegedly over a month before so they knew that
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.880]  the the communications were intercepted the russians the separatists made no effort to
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:13.120]  encrypt the communications and this is the same globalist remember the same globalist that had
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:19.680]  syrian dany remember him yeah but the the big aspect of this is you actually download the video
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.960]  and look at the video encode timestamp and this is not like facebook pages that can be created
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:31.520]  before renamed later this is the actual time the video was created in the file and it was the 16th
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:37.520]  it was a day before the airline was even shot down oh they had it already unprepared it's already
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:44.320]  to roll oh well don't question it only do what the new york times says they say it's poot and it's
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:50.720]  all his fault and we need nuclear war and remember they also told us the dom had atomic bombs and
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:56.160]  the yellow cake from niger and so of course it was all lies but it's just we've not done a question
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:05.520]  at folks in the near future when you realize how fake it all is the football the basketball

[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:33.040]  coming up starting in the next segment we're gonna look at who may have been behind
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:40.080]  the shootdown of the ill-fated malaysian airliner that reportedly over 300 people
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:45.200]  now been confirmed dead and now even mainstream media is asking the question we've been asking
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:50.560]  since last night why was it directed through an area where aircraft were banned by the e u and the
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:58.560]  f a a from flying through and did you know that ukraine shut down a russian airliner back in 2001
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:03.760]  and we weren't on the edge of world war three because of it this is a huge political distraction
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.560]  from the open borders the dollar being in trouble and so much more that's coming up kevin sorbo
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:14.640]  though is just a great guy i'm a fan of some of the christian movies he's produced and been
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:20.000]  involved in the kind of stuff i can show my kids and of course everybody knows him from hercules
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:27.280]  a lot of other big tv shows and movies and he's in a new libertarian freedom promoting film alongside
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:34.800]  night movie dot com and of course uh the author is neil shulman who we're going to get on coming
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:39.120]  up in a few weeks because all the breaking news we're moving him obviously with the russian
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:46.640]  crisis but alongside night uh is the new film uh in theaters and many other places coming out
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.720]  so we want this libertarian style freedom-based film to be successful heavens for both thanks
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:56.080]  for coming on with us hey good to be here good to see you well a lot happening before we get
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.640]  into the film what do you think about how crazy the world's gotten and and the open borders and
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:05.200]  obama and the anti-gun executive orders and everything else what's your take on that
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:11.120]  well the movie kind of feeds into that actually this book was written back in 1979 by neil shulman
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:16.000]  and it pretty much predicted uh everything that's going on the world right now with the economy with
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:21.280]  americans losing their independence losing their freedom of speech losing their freedoms as a whole
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:28.000]  and uh you know everything it's just it's it's amazing of of how accurate this this book has
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.600]  predicted what's going on right now and it's it's crazy i mean i don't know what's gonna
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.720]  happen with this whole putin thing i mean has russia even changed really i mean they make kgb is
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:42.160]  just a different name you know so it's i've been to russia recently i actually went over in january
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.880]  and i'm telling you right now i wouldn't move there so uh you know people still when they're in
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.240]  trouble who do they come to they come to america first don't they even even though they've been
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:54.880]  bashing us for the last dozen years they still come here first whenever there's a problem well i
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:59.680]  totally agree that america is a lot better than russia what's left the bill of rights constitution
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:05.360]  due process and i don't as ron paul has said you know say putin's an angel my issue is george
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:11.120]  soros has been intimately involved the whole ukraine thing so i think both sides are bad
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:16.400]  manipulating the ukrainians against each other i just hope this plane shoot down doesn't escalate
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:21.760]  some type of conflict with russia yeah it's pretty it's pretty scary it's just sad and it's pathetic
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:27.200]  and it's uh i mean i i think with all the evidence mounting already just within 24 hours they're
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:31.600]  they're they're gonna be able to find the guy who actually pressed the button so it's um it's it's
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.000]  pretty insane i mean look look what's going on i mean you go back to watergate you go back to all
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.680]  the attacks on on nix during that time good lord in the last six years we've had far more many
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:46.000]  scandals that have been much much bigger but look where we are we're not doing anything about them it
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  just shows you where the moral curve is gone in this country in in the world where everything now
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.320]  is everything's okay and we're such an apathetic country right now that people don't seem to care
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:59.600]  that this country is getting down into a third world nation kevin sorbo's hercules is with us
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:05.120]  man i'm familiar with liberty films fiction non-fiction with christian films because that's
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:10.880]  what i let my children watch uh you're prolific uh you know in your big niche but for folks that i
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.200]  guess you know only tune into a lot of dominant mainstream media uh you know you're still involved
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:20.240]  with that some but not as much as the everything you're doing briefly talk about some of the projects
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:25.200]  you've been involved in this project because the fact that christian media freedom-based media is
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:31.280]  growing so fast and supplanting the old hollywood structure i think this is one of the most important
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.960]  revolutions happening right now well the independent world is really picked up in in the in the
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.520]  movie making we're still dependent on some degree to get the studios to pick up our movies and get
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.760]  them out to distribution wise but uh god's not dead with a whole different route you know i've
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.480]  done five movies with these guys pure flicks out of out of arizona the the largest distributor of
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.320]  family and faith based movies and god's not dead was a little two million dollar movie and it was
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:59.040]  really pure flicks was very smart and getting it out to all the churches around the country and
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:03.680]  promoting it and having pastors and priests look at this movie and you know tell her congregation
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:08.320]  to go well this two million dollar movie made 62 million dollars and stayed in theaters for three
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:13.280]  months which is unheard of and it's still opening in 33 more countries around the world uh it has
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:17.520]  a very good chance to reach 90 even 100 million dollars on a two million dollar budget well i'd
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.960]  love to get you on for a longer period just about god's not dead but that film's been launched now
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.880]  and again i have no stake in these films i was promoting a film yesterday you know about the fake
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:32.080]  utopia of obama that i'm not involved in because this is how we're going to win the culture war
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:38.400]  tell us about the new film uh that's coming out soon um you know i can't touch that a little bit
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.520]  already it's just it really deals with what's happening in america today i play a a Nobel prize
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:49.120]  winning economist and um i just uh i i'm on i'm on the lamb because i'm calling out the government
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:53.280]  what they are but freedom of speech has pretty much been taken away the dollar's worth nothing
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:00.160]  uh only gold is worth something now and you're kind of seeing that happen in real life um obama
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.400]  is kept i think i call to help tell people at the stock market i say the stock market is is like the
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.720]  dot com industry back in the late 90s which all bunch of ghost money we've been printing so much
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.200]  money over the last six years to try to keep the country afloat but i mean look look how much more
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:20.000]  in debt we are since obama took over in the last six years so uh this movie points a finger at that
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.920]  points to where we're losing all of our all of our rights as as as americans and i i fake my own
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:30.960]  death and really the movie is driven by um my son in the movie i i'm literally only in the movie like
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:36.640]  five or sixteen so i can't say it's it's my movie i mean it really it's it's driven by uh the kid
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:42.960]  playing my son that is trying to figure out a way to really get us out of the country amazing yeah i
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:48.720]  am familiar with the novel i haven't read it yet but but i know it kind of ties in just to the whole
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:54.960]  fact that we as a society will lose our freedoms and we will live in a tyranny if we're not involved
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:02.560]  but now we're here and that's why the films are resonating uh with folks so much because it's not
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:11.040]  alex jones or matt drudge or or world net daily warning people 20 years ago uh it's now here uh
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:17.280]  do you think we'll turn the corner or where does your gut kevin sorbo tell you we're going i don't
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:22.080]  know i'm looking to new zealand i'm telling you i mean it's uh i lived there for seven years with
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:26.480]  with hercules and it's a pretty nice country for a socialist country it's pretty capitalistic i mean
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:36.560]  this country is so large and we've got such a large population i mean they started back in the 60s
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:40.800]  how to get votes they said look we'll promise them free stuff well free stuff as we know isn't free
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.200]  but the people receiving the free stuff view it as being free so to break them out of that cycle i
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.080]  mean how do you stop people how do you get people who should be working to work when they've gotten
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.840]  so used to just basically laying around i'm all for helping people in need of help so don't get
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.720]  me wrong i don't want more hate mail and email you're going to get those anyway from everybody but
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:00.880]  if you're able to work work you know i didn't grow up anything my dad was a public school teacher
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:06.400]  of the fourth of five kids my dad was a waltramondale hubert humphrey minnesota democrat but he instilled
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:10.800]  hard work into all five of his kids saying don't expect handouts don't expect to be lazy in your
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:16.720]  life he boy he he he cracked a whip you know i call his hands soft thunder you know but he got mad
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:21.520]  boy he got mad and he said you you learn to take care of yourself and that's one thing that i'm
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:26.720]  passing on to my kids and unfortunately half this country doesn't see it that way and they don't seem
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:30.720]  to care so how do we turn that boat because i feel like we're past that tipping point but we've got
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:36.240]  we there comes a public education but who's controlling public education let's dive into
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:40.560]  everything that the government runs post office irs just a bunch of bullies you got the public
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:44.400]  education every none of these things work everything is broken that the government puts a hand on this
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:48.960]  country was built on individuals it was always built on individuals it was built on you know
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.640]  the bill gates of the world and the fords of the world and all that i mean that's where it came from
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.640]  and that's what those are the guys who create true wealth and true uh true employment but
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:02.960]  unfortunately um i don't understand why the mass media and uh our government feels they can do a
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:08.480]  better job because they don't and they never have well again it's not that this film is going to save
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:15.520]  the world or your other films will or my films will all of them together will give us a shot at
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:22.240]  turning this around and that's why the collectivist the progressives the authoritarian left is moving
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.960]  to dominate and take over right now because they can see politically the writings on the wall young
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:32.880]  people almost 80 percent are against abortion all the polls are flipping actually in the direction
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:39.200]  of libertarians in the in the direction of of of real christianity not establishment christianity
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:45.760]  the trends are there but the system is in a race to shut us down and i think it's important to call
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:50.800]  out obama you know pat buchanan who i've known for many years and who i like kevin sorbo joining
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:55.840]  his friends we just tuned in he says don't impeach obama let all his bad stuff get republicans
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:03.760]  elected well my issue is you've got to prosecute them or nobody's scared in government of getting
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:11.520]  in trouble i i think we become aids to the evil if we don't say no to it oh i told i'm a total
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:16.960]  agreement and i and on top of that i'm a big firm believer in term limits why can't we get that why
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:22.080]  can't we 315 million people say no more 40 year terms for these congresspeople i don't care on
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.960]  both sides of political aisle they get six years max that's it if a president gets eight years max
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:30.800]  congress gets six that means they get in there they get their job done and they won't got people
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:36.000]  like obama when something huge happens like this i guess there's there's crash and there's huge
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.320]  border crisis he's going on just trying to raise money for the democratic party it's pathetic it's
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:44.720]  it's ridiculous they got to raise tens of millions of dollars for a job that pays 200 grand so what's

[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:10.240]  three or four calls right now in this short second let's just do it brian in georgia you're on the
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:15.040]  air on the missing airplane well i don't think it's missing it's on the ground go ahead you're on the
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:21.920]  air oh hey alex hey go ahead i was listening to you on the internet sorry uh yeah my thought was
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:31.280]  remember that missing plane from malaysia yes i think it kind of ties in it was weird my wife
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:36.400]  and i were driving back from our land up we heard it on the news and we look at each other
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:45.200]  and she doesn't like your news like i do but uh it was just very ironic that it's a malaysia airplane
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:52.240]  once again well i've got to say that that whole thing was very suspicious and doesn't add up but
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:56.240]  we're supposed to not question that or we're bad we're not supposed to question obama care
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.640]  doubling dribbling prices or we're bad we're not supposed to question that all the taxes in it or
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:04.320]  we're bad we're just we're just supposed to do what we're told that's what a good citizen does is
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.600]  get screwed over uh and yeah it's the same making model in the same airline and
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:15.200]  and then operation northwood said they would have one airplane launched with cia on board
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:21.040]  it would land have another identical airplane get blown up and that's how northwood said they
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:26.000]  would blame the russians and the cubans for shooting down an airline that's operation northwood's abc
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.640]  news but when i mentioned that they'll have the boston globes say i made it up and then i'm insane
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:35.920]  and have word al yankovic make a joke video like they've done because they just think they control
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:41.200]  reality and questioning is insane if i walk out and say the sky is blue i'm a bad person
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:47.120]  unless obama says it's okay for me to say that and uh yes i agree with you uh that the whole
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:52.160]  thing's very weird and that had a hundred attendees heading to australian aides conference i mean
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:59.680]  who knows if any of this is even true uh it's all very very bizarre uh but operation northwood's
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:04.560]  called for doing something just like this and then a little bit more recently in 2003 it was
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:11.360]  declassified in 2006 that bush and blair wanted to paint up a plane like a un plane shoot it down
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:17.840]  and blame it on their enemies to start wars a sedom in that case so thank you brian good points
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:24.080]  but again questioning is bad and then so we're going to do it again i think john from texas
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:30.720]  is thinking and looking at things trying to figure out what's happening if you watch a mystery movie
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:37.760]  that's a thought crime if you play clue it's a thought crime you do not think or question
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:43.680]  when people don't know what's going on you receive what the loving government says
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:50.080]  john you're not about to ask questions here are you i want to ask questions about latimer poot
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:56.800]  dally okay go ahead i see the i see the pictures on the internet that he's in church and he's
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:01.440]  he's praying and meeting with church leaders but let's face it they get up high in the kgb
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:06.720]  you almost have to be a hardcore communist and i still see the soviet emblems and all the vehicles
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.200]  i still see red square still named red square when the russian troops marched through there
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:17.040]  they still got red flags and then there's the comma river truck factory uh that was built by
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.920]  the finance by neighbor rockefeller and uh built by the board motor company a truck factory at 36
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:27.280]  miles long cable of that was used to arm the north that that was used to give trucks to the
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:33.280]  north vietnamese for the ho Chi Minh trail it's capable of building 250 000 of military vehicles a
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:38.960]  year i know where's all this stuff going i mean is this just an illusion to put off the sleeping
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.440]  like the soviet defectors said they came over here to in the mid eighties that warned us that
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:46.720]  they're going to put this big illusion up and when we're back apparently they're going to smash us
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:55.440]  with their steel fish you know but but it's more sophisticated than that our government the globalist
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:04.320]  the the john d rockefeller the roth child's on record put the bolsheviks in in 1917 and aided them
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.560]  the whole time they gave 25 million dollars to stalin who was the main henchman of linen
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:16.400]  and our government declassified in 2004 look it up that that our government put mouse the tongue
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:24.080]  into power so yes is there big remnants of the russians and the kgb and all that do i trust
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:29.840]  putin no the point is is that i'm going to come back and break this down briefly and then let you
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:38.640]  get a comment john the issue is the globalist took down the czars to put an evil in used the
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:43.840]  soviet empire to take over parts of the world then built a police state here to counter it that was
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.520]  also used to take over part of the world i'm going to explain full spectrum down that's when we come
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:55.360]  back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:21.120]  all right i want to go to a lot of calls i'm not going to belabor this point
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:25.360]  but let me explain full spectrum dominance as simply as i can
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:32.560]  but it's full spectrum so it's very complex but also very simple if you are global financial
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:40.720]  combines that for 500 years on record are longer with the black no black nobility of
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:48.720]  venice the venetians this is on record mainline history what i'm telling you is known by historical
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:54.400]  and economic scholars this is not my view of things this is this is prima facia admitted
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:00.080]  transferred their system to england in the last 500 years
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:12.240]  napoleon was a competing faction of the very same group out of corsica out of idling he wasn't
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:20.320]  even french and that was a battle between the two venetian systems the two italian systems
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:28.320]  that had the roman technology of governing and manipulation between the britannic forces
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:34.800]  and the napoleonic forces okay i'm simplifying this as much as i can there's knights Templar stuff
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:40.240]  merovingian stuff tied into it all different philosophies but the main banking shipping
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:47.600]  combine british east india dutch east india operation model that is globalism and modern
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:56.560]  mercantilism today they created hitler on record didn't running didn't controlling
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:05.280]  founding training set him up pointed him at europe to blow everything up as napoleon part two
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:11.040]  to bring in a new global britannic model based on the united states
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:22.000]  that doesn't mean hitler was good that he was set up just like isis is being set up in al-qaeda
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.040]  they're horrible they're real they're killing people but they're being funded and protected and
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:38.560]  turned loose by the same britannic model doesn't mean british people it's a model it's a system
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:47.200]  it's a game plan okay and other countries and groups do it as well but they try to mimic that
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:53.280]  model the only way to beat that model is truth going over the top and circumventing the whole thing
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:36:00.320]  and pulling back and exposing the hat trick you don't beat it with the ring of soran you become it
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:09.280]  but everyone tries to adopt it to defeat it i'm gonna stop right there the russians were set up
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:15.760]  because the czars weren't part of the european or british group they were cousins to the british
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:22.000]  and and and were german bloodline and had been quietly off and on working with the germans
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.040]  not in world war one but we're getting back in bed with them at the end of that so they had to be
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:32.640]  taken out and the british put this in the newspapers at the time in world war one they called the
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:40.720]  german problem that they were out producing science and technology and dominating through
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:48.000]  soft power and not through britannic power so they had to be destroyed so they destabilized them
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.320]  had assassinations got the austrian-hungarian empire to get into a fight with them and it was
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:59.600]  their cousins they were fighting with it was german transylvanians in russia germany and england
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:09.120]  running the whole show but if they had adopted machiavellian technologies which themselves
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:14.240]  were venetian black nobility programs okay so those are the different pieces of the puzzle
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:19.200]  so when i sit here and say the globalists are trying to overthrow russia russia took the money
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:25.280]  of the roth child stabbed the globalist in the back double crossed him putin double crossed a
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:30.160]  bunch of them he double deals with them as well putin's been poisoning and killing some of them
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:34.160]  there's a real war going on here they're really trying to do their own new world order right now
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:41.120]  doesn't mean it's good doesn't mean i trust them but there's a certain kgb group that doesn't want
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:46.080]  to kill all the russians and that are nationalistic and they met with schultz and etson he decided to
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:52.560]  leave the us he went back putin was a secret acolyte of schultz and etson later was reportedly
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:56.800]  there when he died i mean i've done the research on all this okay and they've made the decision
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:02.240]  not to put cancer viruses and all their shots and kill all the russians they've decided to
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:08.720]  not go with the full eugenics model and go with a russian bear uh new nationalistic takeover system
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:14.240]  and if the old guard likes red stars on things they'll go with it but they're going with more of a
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:20.160]  strongman el hefe model i don't endorse it they're trying to survive though the globalists are trying
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:24.720]  to bring them down folks just like they're trying to bring down our country bring down our borders
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:31.040]  bring down our share of living take our guns break the patriarch break the male not to empower women
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:36.480]  this is a scientific it's like space aliens landed the globalists are that advanced with their
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:44.000]  technotronic over the horizon google future predicting system and an old mafia of the russians
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:51.280]  does not want to go under it you understand that that's what it is and so it's russia that had
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:57.840]  ukraine uh on its border overthrown by the west it's russia with al qaeda attacking it it's russia
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:03.840]  being destabilized it's russia with the russians are not lobbying to take my guns russians are
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:08.240]  not lobbying to take my private property russians are not lobbying that i can't have any kids
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:14.000]  they're lobbying people to have kids over there and i don't lionize them i know who their faction is
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.600]  and it's infiltrated by globalists as well the globalists have the asian
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.880]  the russian the us and european power blocks playing us off against each other but only to
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:30.240]  kill humanity only to make us bankrupt only to transfer power to the national security states
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.920]  which are models that the technocracy needs they need us fighting with each other to build the
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:42.480]  technotronic towers because only technotronic towers can can battle a technotronic system
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:50.000]  but once we've built the technotronic system for them then the technocracy of the west it's much
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:57.440]  more advanced believes it can then take over in a judgment day skynet scenario the systems
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:02.480]  the systems and circumvent humans merge with the machines and then kill everybody on the planet
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:10.400]  now that is the google plan bill joy told the world about it that is the microsoft program
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:16.880]  and if you can't handle it you can't handle the truth folks this is in all their major publications
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:21.840]  that they're going to get rid of everybody and that the singularity will come but they need global
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:28.320]  adoption of centralized systems for it to integrate with when they release the ai force
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:35.200]  now you notice the robots are rolling out the tanks are rolling out the armored vehicles the
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:41.440]  self-driving cars the factories are replacing humans everywhere it's here you can party a while
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:45.600]  play with your iphone take drugs if you want be a nihilist eat drink and be married or you can
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:50.800]  decide to be part of the future and try to defeat this and so our future progeny and ourselves
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:55.280]  can enjoy the life extension enjoy all these great things that are happening but people are too
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:03.200]  primitive to understand that they're manipulating us all that the palestinian israeli russian dutch
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:10.720]  hispanic white black white catholic protestant male female and the globalists have told me
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:15.840]  i mean i've met with billionaires and elites and people say watch talk about it because it was
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:21.200]  you know meetings and confidence and they said look the public doesn't want to live and they don't
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:26.640]  understand what you understand you are one of us by extension you want to survive now join me
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:32.480]  you people have no idea what's going on and how much danger you're in
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:39.360]  i mean fbi guys in suits trying to impress people coming up and intimidating folks in
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:43.920]  black glasses give me a break you're all full of cancer viruses you're all being microwaved every
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:50.560]  day your kids are walking dead just like everybody else's you got to circumvent the whole fake matrix
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:56.560]  get outside of it and go read books by bill joy and books by ray Kurzweil and all the russian
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:01.040]  scientists are in their own race with this thing and have public symposiums whether it's
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:06.240]  realizable or not it's the architecture that the elite are pushing and promoting
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:15.440]  it's full spectrum dominance towards the end of not blasting space colonies into space
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:22.080]  to ensure our species and empower humanity but to end us the decision has been made
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:27.520]  to transcend humanity in the elite's view you go oh that's going to be transcendence
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:31.920]  where the good machine takes over puts nano tech into everything to make sure we're good
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:40.480]  and a good human is a dead human the elite in all their publications just just type
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:45.200]  elite believe they're another species you'll have times of london ap roiders it's in all the
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:49.840]  they're telling you that they believe they're superior and are going to merge with machines
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:57.520]  and have copies of themselves and they're not going to let you or i have access to that without a
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:05.520]  fight if you even want access to it so that transcends red stars on russian tanks i will
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:09.440]  assure you ladies and gentlemen john does that answer your question
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:14.720]  yeah it does and i really want to believe in blood work i really hope he is a christian i
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:18.800]  would you know i really hope that he turned against i don't think you should believe in
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:23.920]  latimer putin brother you should you should pull outside the spectrum and can you see the pieces
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:29.840]  on the map i mean i just see i'm going to keep both eyes open i i'm not a flying follower i mean
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:34.240]  i want to i want to but i'm still looking at fact that the globalist set that when they send
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:39.360]  cross killing and then there was a launch and pad to take over the world as a social system
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:44.400]  and so i got to keep both eyes open as far as to make sure he's not still secretly part of this you
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:49.280]  know oh i'm sure he's he's all but did you just hear the i mean i we know who putin's part of
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:55.760]  the reorganized collapse soviet union the society to go with a nationalist model because now they
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:00.400]  understand through shoal senetsan and others and through me i don't even talk to him but they
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:04.560]  they listen i'm not bragging folks i mean the the russian government listens to this show
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:09.680]  quotes it it's on record that's what's got the cia so upset i'm here giving them i mean they're
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:16.160]  smart enough to get britannic intel the russians are smart enough to understand this and to get
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:22.720]  past the the the full spectrum false field false narrative that's been put up
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:27.920]  the russians are understanding that they're slated for total destruction
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:38.560]  so that's making them transcend their communism into more of a el hefeism of the chief which is what
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:46.320]  what the globalist knew in 1900 when hg wells wrote things to come they knew that would be
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:50.400]  what they would face in the future do you see what i'm saying it's not that china's good
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:56.560]  or russia's good they're different sub blocks within a contrived
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:06.800]  battle economically and militarily for global supremacy to build the technotronic systems
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:12.640]  within each block that the globalists will then engage in an electronic coup of do you understand
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:18.960]  that well if you talk about legs bootleg games of the 1920s before they consolidated into the
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:24.160]  into organized crimes tend to get really fought each other over territory stuff but yes but that
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:29.600]  was laid out publicly brazinski's written five books on it i didn't come up with this
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:39.200]  they've all written books of the they say they're going to do all this and like no one will talk about
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:45.040]  it except them and then their own people and then they say well look how dumb the public is see
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:49.680]  they don't even care i appreciate your call god bless you sir
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:57.520]  oh god help us i i i i just don't know how to explain this to people i just
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:00.800]  just tell me in origan you're on the air thanks for holding go ahead
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:08.240]  thank you all it's the plane is a distraction the the real deal is the western front and i
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:14.000]  think the only way that we can stop this invasion from the south american continent is by spreading
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.600]  the republic and starting a 51st state movement like baha and get them to join the union and to
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:29.520]  uh learn our ways no i agree mexico has failed and collapsed and you don't stay the same i mean
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:35.040]  you don't have we're in the universe where something sits there either degrades or it it excels
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:41.360]  and and moves forward and a baha would be uh a nice slice and is it one of the safer better
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:47.360]  areas of mexico uh and and it also would secure mexico's flank if you cut it off and built a
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:52.320]  fence there up by where the peninsula is and i think you're probably right the problem is the
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:57.280]  globalist already foresaw that that's why annexation of mexico into the north american union is
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:03.120]  their plan out of the crisis they created they already are one step ahead with the logic to sell
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.680]  the absorption of mexico as a way to fix the problem but they won't fix the problem with
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:12.480]  the absorption of mexico see you just hit full spectrum dominance again and the high level
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:17.840]  intelligence we're facing if we could translate your small booklet that you hand out with all
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:24.640]  the orders into spanish and spread that uh you know the the yellow rights is something that
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:33.520]  hexagons could end all southern uh peoples grab onto those ideas are inherit in them and
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:38.880]  if they knew that they could join the union and there would be no border we don't exactly exactly
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:42.880]  exactly they just see it the way it's been sold that they're not welcome here when they're leaving
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.760]  the hell of stuff and then it's sold that you can only join the communist socialist if you
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:55.200]  want to have freedom it's a total fraud we we do need to spread 1776 worldwide and not just annex
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:01.440]  things we could literally have the ideas if they were properly taught uh expand and would turn
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:06.880]  those places into edens the problem is the globalist have been in latin america for 60 years with
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:13.200]  the forge foundation teaching communism as the only way to resist i've worked with many of these
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:18.480]  laborers they're hardworking they want to be americans they want to they want to blend in it's
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:23.680]  not their fault that people are handing them all these goodies so i want to oh i know i know i know
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:28.960]  i know out there and they set up an economy where you can't even survive as a working class
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:34.080]  person without handouts i mean they admit that's the plan i mean it's not just the hispanics from
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:38.320]  latin america that are getting the freebies on top of working most walmart workers are on welfare on
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:43.520]  top of it most blue collar workers they tell city and state workers now oh you're so low paid
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:49.840]  go get welfare go get food stamps i mean it's disgusting i appreciate your call great points
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:55.040]  tubby yeah it's messages like that they're gonna save humanity we're all in this together folks
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:49:02.720]  it's full full spectrum dominance and oh let's just talk to glenn and ohio glenn you're on the
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:09.840]  air worldwide thanks for holding hello alex can you hear me yes i can hey else i have some really
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:15.200]  important information here and i'm not sure if you mentioned this to your list to your listeners
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:23.120]  are not but this is from history do you do you recall iran air flight six five five yes and
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:29.200]  then right after they had that they had operation praying manus and blew up the persian gulf fleet
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:34.560]  of the iranians well the point here being is that the united states government especially obama and
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:42.320]  the globalists have no business pointing fingers at either russia or the separatists when we ourselves
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:50.720]  destroyed 209 people on board that flight including 66 children and 16 crew died that day well it
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:57.120]  happens in war zones and it's terrible exactly the ukranians in 2001 blew up a russian airliner
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:05.120]  so was there a world war three over that there it is ukraine admits it shot down russian airliner
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:13.920]  2001 killing 78 passengers so why was it not a big deal then because you don't start wars over
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:18.240]  things like this no governments here's the thing about the russians they don't have a motive to
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:26.320]  blow the aircraft up they didn't do it premeditatedly it's a bad move it's like forfeiting the queen
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:31.680]  in a chess game for no reason you see what i'm saying yes i guess the point here being just just
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:37.840]  really quick here is that again we really need to stress hey look us you did the same thing
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:41.680]  you had no business pointing fingers anyone else so just be quiet
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:47.920]  i fell down well bottom line it's george soros trying to start a war with the russians
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:52.480]  so they got such a big crisis obama can come on tv announce a war started with the russians
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:58.000]  i mean all i know is man the globalist are driving this pony and it did the good situation

[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:27.840]  info wars dot com has been up and down some today
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:37.040]  and we have backup websites like prison planet dot com and we're looking into this being an attack
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:43.280]  on the site those routinely happen and we're working on mitigating that but we're going out on
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:48.560]  am and fm stations all over the world youtube thousands of other platforms global shortwave
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:53.440]  and the fact that we're seeing more and more censorship the last week we're suddenly web
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:55:00.080]  filters all over the world not just here in the united states have been
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:06.320]  saying don't go to our websites they're not safe and again they've done that to drudge
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:12.800]  world net daily you name it before this is an attempt to make sure that the fact that we're
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:18.080]  questioning the narrative does not get out up on drudge right now it's got the sun headline
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:24.960]  putin's missile see putin did it now and it's just like babies and incubators
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:33.600]  it it's like claiming that uh there's babies uh that that sedom was stomping the brains out of
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:39.280]  it was a pr firm all faked none of it true to start the first iraq war or that our ships were
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:45.200]  attacked in the vietnam uh harbor didn't happen that's declassified again in the mid two thousands
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  and so now uh you know it's the the sun in england flight mh 17 shot out of the sky putin's missile
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:56:02.320]  well there you go ladies and gentlemen he is he is convicted ladies and gentlemen done open
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:12.800]  open and shut case and so the answer is i guess let uh nato and the eu take over and kick all the
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:18.080]  russians that are about half the population of ukraine out and and maybe just bomb russia i mean
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:24.160]  we've uh i've got headlines up on info wars dot com until the site went down with all these top
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:29.040]  government officials mccain you name it saying there will be hell to pay and others saying let's
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:35.840]  go toe to toe with the russians the site's again up and down it's up right now uh but uh this this

[01:56:54.320 --> 01:57:01.680]  supposed russian separatist dressed up a standing by a russian officer by one of these missile
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:06.160]  launchers that they admit the ukraine government has they claim separatist stole it i mean i could
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:10.960]  dress up like a tsa person and go do stuff right now and people think that tsa did it
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.520]  or impersonate a cop i mean you know you could do that this is what goes on

[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:45.040]  twice and each time coming back i was wearing blades on my sides and nothing was said from the
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:50.560]  customs or the border patrol and all i went across was was my birth certificate and my driver's license
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:58.480]  and uh i'm a u.s army veteran and we the week we spent in el paso we had constant flybys
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:03.600]  over the hotel we were in and they were low enough i could almost see the pilot space
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:09.840]  and they were running about every 50 to 75 minutes i don't know what they were looking for i don't
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:15.440]  know if you knew about that or not but then when we were coming home we hit the border patrol
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:21.600]  checkpoint about a hundred miles east of el paso and the only thing they did was said is everybody
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:28.240]  on board a u.s citizen i said yes they said i go ahead and you know what cartel members going to
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:34.160]  tell the truth no i'm not a u.s citizen i got a truckload of coke back here you know that's how
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:38.720]  loved that they've gotten absolutely our government has opened our borders by design
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:45.360]  and i'm having to convince callers while we don't want war with russia i mean the traders
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:50.560]  run the country but see people at a primitive level even if they're smart get behind the country
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:56.560]  when there's a foreign enemy but we're not a country we're under fema regions we'll only get
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:04.560]  the country back admitting that so absolutely sir any other points uh well then the malaysian
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:10.080]  airliner i've told my family last night i said i guarantee you tomorrow putin's going to be
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:16.480]  blamed with that airliner coming down so we've got too many interest in ukraine that they're not
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:23.840]  going to just let go of easy and by interest we mean globalist interest yes sir yes sir the oil
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:29.120]  the gas all the whole man yours and there's u.s studies that it's not like it's russian studies
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:35.520]  that the sanctions are hurting europeans and americans worse than russians in in power prices
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:40.720]  you name it i mean but the globalists don't care but hurts us they love that everything they do is
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:47.280]  to bankrupt us and to control us catherine albright's going to be in studio with us uh coming up here

[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:27.600]  and many others studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:32.320]  including tooth decay lower niq and even cancer it tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when

[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:45.360]  ladies and gentlemen we are back and i am here as the music runs out just trying to get the
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:52.800]  documents and articles uh straight you can go to london guardian from 2006 and you can see the
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:09:02.240]  headline that bush blair in 2003 had a plan to get a us aircraft shot down painted up like a u n plane
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:09.360]  to then blame it on saddam hussein but they figured out other ways to stage that war then
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.720]  there's the headline blair bush deal before iraq war revealed in secret memo
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:23.280]  p m promised to be solid behind us invasion with or without u n backing and here's the headlines
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:29.760]  today out of the daily mail putin blames ukraine for loss of the flight saying it was a war zone
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:35.600]  why were aircraft being routed through there but john mccain responds it says they'll be
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:41.440]  hell to pay putin responds by saying let's have a ceasefire after the plane attack
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:47.040]  where they've had a bunch of ukraine aircraft bombing people and the response out of that
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:57.040]  was by the neocons and bolton to come out in the news john bolton and he said let's go toe to toe
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:05.200]  with the ruskies right out of the 1964 dr strange love movie where swim pickens rides down the hydrogen
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:10.080]  bomb starting the end of the world maybe a new cuban missile crisis will play out this time
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:17.440]  maybe this is how they'll get their total power ladies and gentlemen so putin says let's have peace
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:24.640]  and the answer is no how dare you they're calling it putin's missile but when the ukrainian shot
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:30.800]  down a russian passenger liner in 2001 the russians didn't talk about any military action
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:36.080]  because they're the bad guys and we're the good guys because we fund al qaeda killing christians
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:42.000]  all over the middle east and give ices heat seeking missiles again i'm not for russia here
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:46.160]  this is the globalist above our countries playing us off against each other but george
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:52.720]  soros a month ago told the new york times that he was the main person behind the overthrow of the
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:58.800]  elected ukrainian government the west started this and then somebody routed that aircraft
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:06.160]  through that airspace where for months no one's been allowed to fly and that's in the news but
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:11.520]  it's in cbs news and a few others but kind of like yeah okay and and that's important but not that big
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:17.920]  of a deal no it's a big deal you don't avenge 300 people killed accidentally even if the russians
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:23.520]  did it and that's questionable by starting a larger war well you know what uh dr catherine
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:32.160]  albricht is right here uh in studio with us and spy ships dot com catherine albert dot com al
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:39.360]  b r e c h t dot com we had kevin sorbo on earlier talking about a libertarian film that he stars in
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:43.520]  there's a lot of great people out there promoting freedom that's how we're taking the world back
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:50.720]  sorbo's new film has already made in just a few months 69 million dollars and he's got another
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:55.600]  one coming out now i have no financial connection to it i'm just promoting it because this is how
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:12:01.040]  we bring them down our films our culture it's superior and we set it up against them people
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:06.560]  support it people support info wars dot com you promote the show you buy our products you give
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:11.840]  them to other people that will build a culture of freedom voting with your dollars that's why
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:16.800]  they want to end the free market uh catherine is the host of syndicated program she'll be hosting
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:23.120]  it today out of my studios the dr catherine albright show is uh and again she's right here with us
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:32.160]  campaigning as usual to expose the whole technotronic nsa spy chips grid and she's here with us in
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:38.080]  studio and traveling with her uh lovely friend uh who's uh running for i guess state senate so we'll
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:43.120]  we'll talk about that some with you as well okay you can tell i'm wound up so i'm gonna have to
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:48.160]  sit back here and just to get your take on things and catch my breath but thanks for coming to texas
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:53.200]  tell us why you came to texas and what's coming up and then let's get into the big picture with you
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:59.600]  of um wow everything you talked about everything i talked about from light bulbs that are spying
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:05.440]  on you that people didn't believe to uh uh smart meters outside your house with microphones listening
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:11.200]  to you i mean it's all just coming out it's a it's a coming out they're like of course we listen to
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:15.680]  everything you do but let's play that fox news clip of the wall street journal editor saying
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:21.840]  well we record everything so we'll know who shot down the plane this is wonderful uh but but except
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:26.800]  who runs the system uh so we're gonna talk about all that and more thanks for coming in hey thanks
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:30.640]  alex and you know one of the things you and i of course knew these things were coming years and
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:36.240]  years ago and it's only been i think really in the last year or so that people regular people
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:40.080]  people who don't listen to the alex john show don't listen to my show have figured it out i think
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:44.160]  a lot of it because of ed snowden revealing what's going on in a way that even people who want to
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:48.560]  deny it can't deny it they have to say wow this really this really is happening yeah first they
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:52.800]  weren't spying on anything it was all conspiracies even though we already had all the other whistle
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:14:00.240]  blowers of a decade ago william benny super high level uh wane madson but just no it doesn't exist
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:05.200]  yeah and i think what's what we're undergoing now is sort of a psychological shift to get people
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:10.240]  into a mindset of accepting and even embracing the very change that they want to put into our lives
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:15.040]  the best example i think right now people can understand is the use of cell phones right
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:20.320]  everybody's carrying around a 24 seven tracking device that even 15 years calling it a phone is
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:26.640]  a misnomer phone it's not one function of a globalist design total takeover i mean bill gates
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:30.640]  admitted what four or five years ago he goes i want connect to be like cell phones i want to take
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:35.120]  your life over yeah no it's it's not a phone and i think what we're going to start seeing more and
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:40.000]  more is these these things trying to tentacle into other parts of our lives the one that has me
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:44.560]  probably the most concern right now is our homes because we've kind of gotten used to i think we
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:47.360]  shouldn't have but we've gotten used to being surveilled in the public sphere you walk down the
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:52.000]  street there surveillance cameras there's um a heat recognition tracking and and thermal
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.040]  trackers all sorts of things going on we're tracked from the sky they have photographs
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:58.160]  of the front of our homes but they don't know what's going on inside of our homes
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:02.320]  and i think that's a big part of what we need to stand up in resistance against well well they
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:07.120]  don't admit they do but google's on record the cameras the microphones it's all in lifetime
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:11.760]  well i mean they're but but but they're trying to sell it to us is something that that we will pay
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:17.920]  for and i think this is really the difference between 20 20th century tyranny and 21st century
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:22.400]  tyranny is in the 20th century you use guns and tanks to get your way they're still doing a bit
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:27.680]  of that but i think they figured out through all of the psychology that the 20th century contributed
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:31.760]  an understanding of how people think and that's what your doctorate says you can speak to it is
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:36.320]  yes i actually have a doctorate in human development and psychology from harvard university and i mean
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:40.720]  harvard harvard's where they actually teach a lot of the technocrats how to do this that's probably
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:48.480]  true well if they're higher level phd's i just had uh one of those phd's on frances boil and he's
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:53.120]  breaking down and i've also had other political scientist on who also went there and at the
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:57.040]  higher level they don't even mince words about this well it's it's really about understanding
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:16:00.480]  what makes people tick and i guess like anything else you can use it for good you can use it for
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:04.880]  bad but it seems like it's being used for bad and you look at the recent facebook scandal
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:09.200]  where university professors people doing psychological research were able to figure out
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:13.600]  that if they fed people that negative news that they would become negative that these
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:18.480]  emotions were contagious figuring out how to manipulate people and then of course what emerges
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:23.280]  is got facebook's a lifetime study just like disney world admits on how to control you that's
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:27.920]  right so the the very professor who was involved in that study of course as you know was also
[02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:32.880]  involved with the defense department doing research on how to quell dissent how to make sure
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:37.760]  that when governments do certain things that people don't rise up or become ruffled or upset
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:42.000]  so the very same professor who's doing that research with the defense department is doing
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:46.880]  this research with facebook and then right on the heels of that we find out from its note in
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:51.920]  that the intelligence agencies of the u.s and great britain have been manipulating public opinion
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:57.600]  and the the key thing i think to understand is that as individuals we look to other people to
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:02.000]  know what to do and probably the best example if if you and i were sitting in a theater and we
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:06.560]  smelled smoke we might look around and say is is there a fire i don't know and and if everybody
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:10.560]  else was kind of went yeah whatever and kept eating their popcorn we might do the same thing
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:13.600]  but if we smelled smoke and looked around and everybody was running for the exits we'd get
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:18.240]  up and run for the exits and it's not because we're stupid it's because we look to other people
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:23.360]  to figure out what to do now your listeners my listeners are slightly different ilk they're
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:28.480]  programming herd mentality they well it they're taking advantage of something that's already in
[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:33.200]  us which is that we look to other people to see if something is dangerous or not that's how they
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:36.720]  get us eating all of this horrible food because everybody else is eating it so it can't be that
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:41.440]  bad but that's also i think how they get us to embrace these things the cell phone library's
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:46.640]  got one it can't be bad to be tracked 24 seven the gps track everybody's got it the the the
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:51.600]  things on the side of your home that are that are um you're using rfide to track your electricity
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:56.480]  usage everybody else is doing it so i think that's really where this is going is figuring out
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:02.480]  how to make the internet look like nobody cares like nsa revelations you you do polls on this
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:06.400]  well it came out this week what we already knew because we're under attack by it exactly they
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:12.000]  have all these fake bots to drive trends and make it look like freedom isn't popular it to make it
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.400]  look like it's not popular and it's just like the smelling smoke people think are we becoming less
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:20.640]  free or is there tyranny of foot well let's look around let me look on the internet oh no it looks
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:24.240]  like everything's fine so i'll just go back to sleep well that's like weird al yankovic came out
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:30.320]  in the tactics this week and it's got millions of views and and just if he mixes in kooky stuff
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:35.520]  with real stuff that's going on that if you but if you believe the government's done anything wrong
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:44.560]  you're a nut with a tinfoil hat i mean literally a guy i never even disliked guaranteed got recruited
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:50.480]  to promote that and put that out for social control and and the documents keep coming out
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:54.640]  but i can just look at it and tell the how the script was written because it's a standard deal
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:19:01.360]  and it's so painful to see how they get so many people to join the takedown of our civilization
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:05.120]  because if you look at what the globalists are planning that's what's so scary they're not bringing
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:10.960]  in this total social grid to bring peace and tranquility it is consciously to bring in a
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:16.240]  hellish world government that's anti-human well and i think the real goal is the the people at the
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:20.000]  top and i call them pawn scum they've kind of like they like to think they're the cream at the top
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:23.520]  of the milk but they're really the the scum that's risen to the top of the pond to choke out all the
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:27.360]  oxygen for the rest of us and i live in new Hampshire we're going to scrape that stuff off
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:32.720]  periodically to get some life back into the pond and those people at the top you know they they want
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:36.480]  they want us around to clean the streets and take out the garbage but they really don't want us
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:40.960]  making major change and now they've got the robots coming along and on record they say look just go
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:45.440]  have fun and play and party humans won't work anymore but when you read the more internal

[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:18.720]  with sword and pistol by my side the future has been charted by the technocrats they've written
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:22.480]  books on it it's not a very pretty place they're taking us and they mean business
[02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:26.160]  many a soldier we have to decide that we can take control of our own destiny
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:31.120]  and promote individualism people aren't going to want to join the new world order
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:36.480]  so they need to socially control us but it's illegitimate for them to say that we basically
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:42.160]  have to do what they want it's a fraud it's called slavery so how do we decide to build a future
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:47.920]  for humans that's better and more civilized and happier rather than a future that doesn't
[02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:54.400]  have humans as bill joy wrote why the future doesn't need us for wired magazine now 15 years ago
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:25:00.000]  and said the elite have pretty much decided to kill everybody and that's what you're getting at
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:06.800]  is that the robots are here it is the rise of the machines uh kathryn break that down well so it's
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:10.800]  funny even as i'm getting on the airplane to come here i'm flying united and instead of the gate
[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:15.440]  agent taking my my ticket and putting it on the scanner there's no a machine and i'm thinking
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:19.520]  well why pay a human if you can put in a machine i mean that's that's going to be the attitude on
[02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:23.600]  everything they can automate they will we would see the same thing in all the cash registers if we
[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:28.720]  hadn't said what was the self-checkout garbage i don't want that so they really are moving towards
[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:32.880]  replacing humans with machines and i had an interesting experience recently in wall tam
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:39.680]  massachusetts i was actually uh there for a big engineering conference and one thing led to another
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:43.840]  the guy who drove me to a television appearance i asked him who's the most famous person you've
[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:48.880]  ever driven and he says well the the ceo of google eric schmidt he was sitting right here where i'm
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:53.280]  sitting he's like yeah and i said what what in the world was eric schmidt doing in massachusetts he
[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:57.920]  said well he was going to see boston dynamics where they make the robots and i said you're
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:02.720]  kidding me he said yeah no in fact it's right next to your hotel literally next door to my hotel so
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:08.320]  i was sleeping in a hotel within a half a block of big dog and all of its companions so i just
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:12.720]  cruised on over and introduced myself and walked in the door and they're literally standing there
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:18.640]  was a whole array in their uh reception area of of the big dog robots and what they envision of
[02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:21.680]  course this this company has now been bought by google and you have to ask yourself what in the
[02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:27.360]  world is google buying military robots that were developed by the defense department why does a
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:31.120]  search engine need that kind of stuff you know these things can run through the woods they can
[02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:36.080]  hunt people down it's kind of crazy so i think it's it's sort of a one-two punch there's the
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:40.400]  the military sort of robot control aspect on the one side where they rule you through
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:44.240]  technological power and surveillance but i think the other side people need to think a little
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:49.280]  bit more about is that they're getting us to voluntarily pay for the privilege of being
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:55.920]  tracked so 20th century tyranny it was pole pot killing a quarter of cambodia in five years it was
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:01.760]  mao se tung killing 200 million chinese it was joseph stalin killing 60 million of his own
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:06.240]  citizens and ruling by terror so everybody in those countries was afraid but there's a little
[02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:09.760]  bit of a problem when you have people afraid they want to take you down they want to depose you
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:14.000]  they want to get rid of you and so they've figured out a new way in the 21st century
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:20.320]  which is to make us look to them for protection look to them to save us and then get us to
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:25.120]  voluntarily instead of at a point of a gun say you have to carry a tracking device 24 seven
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:28.880]  they say here pay us six seven eight hundred bucks and we'll give you a tracking device
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:35.040]  that has music and games and all this addictive stuff on it it's total and social programming
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:40.160]  premeditated on record and again it's not that we're having automation because it's good it's
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:46.720]  being done to replace us so that humans aren't making decisions at the micro level it's all
[02:27:46.720 --> 02:27:51.600]  centralized that's the problem right and what's going to come next see because they're trying to
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:56.080]  figure out how do we get into people's homes how do we get see that the invisible thing that they
[02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:59.840]  can't track and surveil is what you say to your your spouse over breakfast oh that's what gates
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:04.000]  said it's connect that can look through your walls how do you listen to you knows your face
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.120]  can right so both apple right now and google are in an arms race to figure out which one is going
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:13.280]  to be the first to automate your home and if you ever watch star trek the original you know the
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:18.000]  computers there and they would say hey computer plot a course for a ryan seven and the computer was
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:23.280]  always listening and then the computer would say you know yes captain blah blah blah they want to do
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:29.760]  that in your home and instead of making it seem that they're watching tracking surveilling camera
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:33.440]  monitoring you they instead want to make it seem like you're going to have all this new control
[02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:38.560]  over your home but the reality if you put cameras into your home then they're going to use that the
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:42.240]  same way they've used everything else they've used to track us it's like your house being run off a
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:48.320]  smartphone it's literally like making your house glass and they're advertising in everywhere
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:54.800]  even for poor people put your house on this and if you go look at new houses in austin they've
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:59.120]  all got smart systems and it's like it's a twenty thousand dollar system part of the price don't
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:03.680]  you want it yeah austin is a test bed for this information one of the reasons i came to austin
[02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:09.040]  is is because austin is a test bed those remote controllable thermostats that we're putting here
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:13.840]  what five seven years ago it's been a long time though that started right here in austin so
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:19.920]  this is really an epicenter i think the of both sides that's the smart meter going from the
[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:25.360]  from the outside of your house into your house now well they can even remotely turn off your your
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:29.040]  air conditioning if you sign up for their system and that's going to happen to everybody's home
[02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:33.120]  if we allow it to and then back when we would tell them before this went in six seven years ago
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:38.160]  they were doing it people say austin's not putting in thermostats that they control yeah well and then
[02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:43.200]  it's here it's just this culture they boast about it they get you to pay for it it's a cool thing sign
[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:48.880]  up but remember just a few years ago it didn't exist again this is a decepticon type system
[02:29:48.880 --> 02:29:55.680]  we're in the march say with us the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:04.720]  man when i get home from work all betty does is watch her reality tv and then she goes to sleep

[02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:16.720]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most americans spend 90 percent of their time
[02:32:16.720 --> 02:32:21.840]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the
[02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:27.200]  united states well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't
[02:32:27.200 --> 02:32:31.680]  forget the fact that six million americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when i began
[02:32:31.680 --> 02:32:37.040]  to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order
[02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:41.840]  to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against made with
[02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:47.920]  organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the usa the new info wars life lung cleanse is
[02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:52.240]  here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment
[02:32:52.240 --> 02:32:58.640]  now available exclusively in info wars life dot com or by calling toll free 8882533139
[02:32:58.640 --> 02:33:14.560]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:34.640]  you know i like humanity i like our music i like our culture i like the good things we produce
[02:33:34.640 --> 02:33:41.440]  i don't want to be overwritten by the technocrats that say i'm junk but even if i was junk do other
[02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:46.720]  humans have a right to just set up a total tyranny and take all my freedoms i mean if you try to stick
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:53.280]  a camera in a government building they'll arrest you for espionage but then they're putting in the
[02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:59.200]  local churches here in austin texas all the big mega churches federal grants under faith based
[02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:04.560]  initiatives to put connects in all the sunday school classes and the kids play microsoft video
[02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:09.520]  games and if you go to the preacher and say this is a bad idea they say if you stir up trouble the
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:13.600]  police officer will take you out for even talking to them because and that's at mega churches i'm
[02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:18.080]  going to do an investigation on it soon and that's because they're not preachers they're actual
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:23.760]  technocrats of social control under clergy response teams we're not just facing machines
[02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:30.000]  we're facing human human traders with the elite who have been told prepare for stabilization during
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:35.280]  collapse and they've recruited them under infra guard under clergy response and the rest of it
[02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:41.040]  as actual spies almost every dentist and medical doctor my dad knows has been approached by homeland
[02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:48.800]  security to be secret agents and they're doing it across the board folks they're fully converting us
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:54.720]  to an absolute tyranny to the point of opening the border to collapse the country so that's
[02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:59.840]  how serious this is i wanted to get kathryn albert's take on this i wanted to play this clip from
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:06.880]  fox news today with john bussey the wall street journal assistant managing editor telling fox
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:11.280]  we need the nsa to spy on everything and we're going to learn who did this missile
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:18.400]  because they are going to quote pull all this well they already recorded it so they've gone from
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:23.680]  doesn't exist no man behind the curtain to well here's the problem they can plant stuff in there as
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:29.120]  well so let's go ahead and go to that club that's that's the latest uh data points at the end of the
[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:33.840]  day this is a time where the where the where the citizens around the world are going to be very
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:38.400]  happy for the nsa because they're going to be scarfing up these telephone calls they're going to be
[02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:43.680]  able to analyze this data they'll be able to able to determine most likely see they need an excuse some
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:48.240]  of the communications that went on after the crash happened which will probably clarify the picture
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:53.840]  of the days to come see because the truth is they set it up decades ago it goes back with europe
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:59.440]  50-something years anglin back to world war two everything's being listened to but the british
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:04.240]  papers would say we're listening to no phone calls and it came out the nazis believed that
[02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:09.040]  and the argument is well listening to all the phone calls in england they infregard got all the
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:15.280]  operators to do it gave them a little extra money well we beat the nazis so it must be okay but see
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:20.080]  then it's never went away it was used by another political group to take control your take on that
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:24.000]  well how do you get people to agree to allow you to take away their freedoms you scare them
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:29.680]  if people are afraid and plus now after the nsa after what it snowed and stole us there's a big
[02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:34.160]  question of well why don't we shut these systems down and of course if they can show that the
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:38.400]  systems are protecting you and keeping terrorists from blowing you up and and a terrorist under
[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:43.760]  every rock from killing you and your kids then yeah you say oh thank you instead of thank you for
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:48.640]  all the surveillance instead of what the heck is up with all this unconstitutional surveillance so
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:53.200]  it's really it's it's a way of shifting public opinion and i think it was very disturbing when
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:58.320]  we discovered that the intelligence agencies of the u.s government in britain were intentionally
[02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:03.600]  manipulating public opinion so that we're all saying oh how of how frightening how frightening we
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:07.120]  really need help and then they say it well that's why we're doing the surveillance that you say you
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:13.360]  don't like better start liking it because we're keeping you alive and they're funding and creating
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:19.360]  al-qaeda and isis groups and giving them weapons to attack us i mean this is a really evil criminal
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:24.800]  group running things well you need enemies every every group that wants to take power needs an enemy
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:29.120]  because there's no other ways there's no justification but think about that our government is open the
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:34.880]  borders and is funding al-qaeda to kill every christian they come across well you even look at
[02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:40.880]  sudam hussein christians lived in iraq peaceably under sudam hussein and even had guns and now
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:44.800]  that sudam hussein is deposed now we have a whole other government and nobody's armed women can't
[02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:50.800]  go to college they wear burkas and they get sexually mutilated and they don't can't have guns
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:57.520]  that's what our government wants to put in yeah so you can say sudam hussein maybe he was bad maybe
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:01.280]  he was good i don't know but when you look at well he wasn't good well he was from an older
[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:08.320]  he was cia he was he was trained in 1958 he was a cia officer not just an asset he was set up
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:14.320]  clearly but he was the old cia when they actually had movie theaters and swimming pools and and
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:19.440]  wanted stability yeah i mean the old cia was bad but compared to these people there's so much evidence
[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:26.080]  and the the real reason was we wanted to be in the middle east and we wanted to have a justification
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:32.080]  to establish a base in the middle east and not only that but it was iraq it was the iraqi population
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:36.640]  that was used to test out all of the iris scanning technology all of the portable fingerprinting
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:42.640]  all of the checkpoints and as i said way back then 10 years ago i said mark my words they're
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:45.760]  going to test this out over there and then they're going to bring it home and they're going to start
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:51.360]  deploying it in the us and they are but we better have checkpoints on the highway catherine or al-qaeda
[02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:57.040]  might i just might shoot down airplanes yeah well again it's it's cute and who gave them who gave
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:01.680]  them missiles keep you afraid and then if you say i i think all this surveillance is bad then your
[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:05.920]  mother-in-law your brother your your co-workers says what are you talking about there's enemies
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:10.400]  out there the reality if there were enemies out there we would have every bridge every subway
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:14.960]  every power station in this country blown up and thank god we haven't well the government wouldn't
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:20.560]  be opening the border completely yeah well that's a whole other that's a whole other topic yes i want
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:26.160]  to go to some phone calls but uh tell us about brave new books you've got an event uh coming up
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:30.560]  there everybody should come out to it in support in support them the great work they do here in
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:34.320]  austin texas tell us about that tell us about some of the other projects you're working on as you
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:39.680]  travel all over the country uh fighting you know these face scanning and schools and thumb printing
[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:44.400]  and biometrics and everything else yeah so i actually got my start on radio seven years ago
[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:51.600]  in 90.1 fm right here in austin texas they've had some uh extensively legal expenses and for those
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:56.320]  who don't know let me just find this it's a micro that doesn't interfere people would call it a pirate
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:59.680]  and it's been on forever and it's gone to supreme court and stuff with the FCC
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:03.440]  and they've been battling them so you're here to help them yeah so the thing about the FCC
[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:07.920]  they have the authority for anything that travels over state lines but that radio station in no in
[02:40:07.920 --> 02:40:12.080]  no stretch comes even near a state line and so the real debate has been does the federal
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:16.720]  government even have authority to look at at broadcasting that doesn't go over state lines
[02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:21.680]  so they have been uh truly wonderful to me over the last seven years so i've flown out to support
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:27.760]  them they're doing a fundraiser at txlr.net where people can contribute to keep them on the air
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:31.840]  and tomorrow night at brave new books 7 30 p.m i'm going to be giving a talk we're going to be
[02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:37.280]  doing giving away door prizes including start mail accounts one year start mail pgp
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:41.600]  encrypted accounts talking about start page and all the other things that i'm working on so that'll
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:48.000]  be tomorrow night 7 30 that is saturday at brave new books across the street from ut austin the
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:55.600]  campus there well to be clear about this micro fm was always supposed an am was always supposed to
[02:40:55.600 --> 02:41:00.800]  be part of the FCC they never allowed it never did it and now they've given away the whole digital
[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:07.520]  spectrum of the big monster stations not even the licensed mom and pops and our country's collapsing
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:11.600]  and if you've got people in their houses that have been putting this show out your show out others
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:18.240]  across the country battling multiple fines you name it making no money just because they want to
[02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:23.600]  warn people there's full around the water the borders are down there i mean this is the resistance
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:29.040]  back before the cia was totally new world order at every level they would pay in the 40s 50s 60s
[02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:35.040]  70s and 80s in authoritarian communist regimes to get micro fm systems in i happen to know for
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:40.240]  effect some of the first micro fm systems that were run here in austin texas but i have no idea who
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:47.280]  were actual leftover units from the 80s that had been sold as surplus because they were trying to
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:51.040]  keep them from being sold here in the us and actually been using eastern europe to battle
[02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:56.560]  communism so people i know took systems that battled communist and put them up against people
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:42:02.960]  trying to take farmers land outside this town so so i mean these people are patriots and so i just
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:06.480]  salute what you're doing and i salute what they've done yeah well thank you and i also wanted to
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:11.840]  mention i have a new column on tech technology and privacy and the internet at ehow.com along with
[02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:17.200]  my spy chips co-author list mackin tires so after many years of a hiatus we're back together
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:23.600]  writing again on privacy topics our latest ehow column is on encryption ways you can get more
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:29.920]  encryption the fact that the basically the only way that you can defeat the nsa right now on the
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:34.560]  internet is through encryption ed snoden verified that he said encryption works it's pretty much
[02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:39.920]  the only thing that does so ed ehow.com we've got a new column up there we have a new column every
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:44.560]  week we got another one coming out on monday teaching people how to take the gps coordinates
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:49.360]  out of their phones and out of their photos so people don't realize when you take a photograph
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:53.520]  if someone were to take a photograph right here in your studio alex and post it up on the internet
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:59.040]  incorporated in there is exif data in the photograph that anyone can see that would
[02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:03.920]  that would pinpoint the precise gps coordinates that we are standing in right now that is true if
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:07.920]  you take a photo in a home that's true if you take a photo of your kids playing in the pool
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:12.000]  that's true of in fact and by the way for those that don't know it's a secret global project for
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:18.080]  at least 30 40 years all the printer ink and all the big printer companies print secret codes in
[02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:22.880]  the ink they do the monies they know when you're going through the airport what you got i tell folks
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:27.680]  that 15 years ago they laugh at me if you take a blue light and you shine it on a printer out of your
[02:43:27.680 --> 02:43:31.600]  a print out out of your printer you can actually see tiny yellow dots and they actually form a
[02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:36.240]  specific pattern that identifies the printer and the serial number of the printer that printed them
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:41.680]  so it's really about finding multiple ways to to track things back and doing it in a way that's
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:45.600]  that's secretive that people don't know is and it's all because quote the secret service said
[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:49.200]  we don't want money counterfeiting meanwhile they're the biggest counterfeiters out there at
[02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:53.440]  the federal reserve it's not even a u.s. dollar everything's a fraud and a fraud as they devalue
[02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:58.480]  the money and then of course it turns out that's not really what it's for it's for total full
[02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:03.840]  spectrum dominance yeah and as far as the the tracking of money i've still yet to find evidence
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:08.160]  that they're able to do it but there are anecdotal stories of people saying i don't know what's
[02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:12.000]  driving through whatever highway and i got pulled over and they seem to know i had a lot of cash in
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:18.320]  my car kathryn i've talked to deep let me just tell you i have from a whistleblower over 10 years
[02:44:18.320 --> 02:44:23.520]  ago that the filament line in them can be energized and i was told by the same people
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:28.000]  that all the major computer chips that were standardized even if you were unplugged from
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:34.160]  the internet uh they can energize the chips and they're actually wireless and then that is true
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:38.560]  and then it's sure we're on record breaking it a decade before it was admitted this year that's
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:43.520]  right so so so the issue is they have an energized system that they i don't know how to explain it
[02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:50.640]  that that picks it up and then it reflects it off yes and just like rfid but expanding on all of that
[02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:57.840]  is the fact well it's just this this is here it's happening now so the internet of things we talked
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:45:01.760]  about it speaking of 10 years ago when you were first talking about this you had me on the show
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:07.680]  i don't know 10 12 years ago talking about rfid and this upcoming internet of things and now rather
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:11.520]  than once again rather than resisting it as we should people are embracing it oh the internet
[02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:15.840]  of things every physical object on the planet every cup of coffee every refrigerator is going to
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:19.680]  broadcast its contents we're going to know it's in people's medicine cabinets it's going to be great
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:23.760]  and they're actually huge conferences i just got invited to speak at a big conference in
[02:45:23.760 --> 02:45:27.840]  roam on the internet of things and they want to fly me out and because i'm the only voice out of
[02:45:27.840 --> 02:45:32.720]  like 40 people that are going to be there that says maybe it's not such a good idea so this idea of
[02:45:32.720 --> 02:45:38.640]  embedding everything with trackability smart dust and it's about making every physical object on the
[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:43.760]  earth everything we do is available so you can searchable like like the internet yes searchable
[02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:48.480]  like the internet so you want to say um what what's in alex's pocket right now and and you look at
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:52.080]  the most recent doorway you walked through where you look at and and be able to know that and then
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:55.760]  now they announce oh the police are giving the codes to kill switch all the cell phones in the
[02:45:55.760 --> 02:46:02.000]  city oh we put microphones up to listen to you and if you look at that what they're doing with all
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:06.480]  of these different surveillance grids is they're using them to also now financially shut down
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:12.320]  their competition all this massive data is only given to select groups to then be able to predict
[02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:17.280]  the future yeah so so when we're giving all this information about ourselves the first thing i would
[02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:22.240]  say to people and i'm sure you've said this over many years turn off the mainstream media because
[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:27.040]  it's feeding you misinformation we now know that from it's notan we know that from multiple sources
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:31.040]  that the people who watch a lot of that kind of television have the wrong idea of what's going
[02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:36.960]  on because it's it's manipulating people and the next thing don't post your every thought
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:42.320]  on facebook don't post all of your connections on facebook don't write your personal emails when
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:46.320]  you're planning to get together to talk about these things don't do it through gmail where they
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:51.120]  read every single email that you send and receive people don't realize this but if you if you have
[02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:57.360]  a gmail account and you have an attachment on the account or yahoo account or a hotmail account
[02:46:57.360 --> 02:47:01.120]  if you have an attachment and it's let's say your resume or let's say it's something more
[02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:06.640]  important like your your recent tax return when when it goes into their system they literally
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:11.280]  strip it off they open it up they make a copy of everything in there they know your social security
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:17.200]  number your accountants name your deductions your income and all of this we are contributing to it
[02:47:17.200 --> 02:47:20.800]  see that's that's the reason why i have been working for the last three years to create
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:24.480]  start mail so that we've got an alternative so that there's a way that regular people can start
[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:30.240]  using encryption and get off of these other systems so simple things people can do to start
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:35.360]  getting off not not just off the grid grid grid the physical grid but getting off the
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:40.320]  information grid and that's why you know if you're going to go to a website i had somebody asked me
[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:45.120]  the other day how if i want to go to darpa should i just link directly and i'm thinking i wouldn't
[02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:49.600]  link directly to darpa but it's start page start page dot com we've got a thing where if you look
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:55.760]  up darpa it says view by x quick proxy and what happens will go to darpa for you make a copy of
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:00.400]  their website put it on our servers and then darpa never connects with you and you can see
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:05.520]  information on the internet privately it's a proxy so these are free tools that should be using well
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:09.520]  i think that's a great idea that there are two different views of this and i think both are
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:14.400]  applyable because they sell this idea in culture that's either one of the other of
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:19.440]  these different systems you can only pick one or two generally in all different forms of thought
[02:48:19.440 --> 02:48:28.320]  and you can find things that are usable it's good to choose to keep your stuff private because you
[02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:33.760]  want to and because it's being stolen and because they're using it against humanity in general it's
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:40.000]  not that you have something to hide exactly but then it's important to operate in full view of
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.880]  the enemy when you're engaged in political speech and to not be chilled it's not like oh they're
[02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:50.080]  after me they're listening i better shut up they win that way make your private stuff hard to get
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:57.360]  but then be very vocal and public wide open sharing everything on facebook or all the other
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:06.800]  myriad systems uh so that we flood all their channels with humid that shuts down these controlled
[02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:11.840]  growth curves they have where they're gaming the system with trends that's what we have to do
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:17.920]  all of you are warriors every race color creed religion to understand they don't want info wars
[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:22.240]  dot com information out they don't want us on facebook and youtube people say well why are you on
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:26.720]  there because that's where the war is that's why you've got to go to our facebook's you've got to
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:31.760]  go to our youtube you've got to go to our twitter's you've got to go to all our systems and you have
[02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:36.560]  to send it out to everyone you have to send the memes out we're the tip of the spear here and
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:41.760]  we've already had a gigantic effect thanks to all your prayers and work and drudge and
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:47.040]  so many m&m affiliates carrying the show and but but we're all in this together that's why i
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:54.560]  spend the whole show magnifying other talk show hosts are doing a good job and and who aren't
[02:49:55.520 --> 02:49:59.440]  humid for the establishment with cognitive infiltration you see a lot of infighting
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:04.080]  stirring up that's literally government agents folks when you see that people are on stirring
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:10.960]  some up all day that is humid bad humid engaged in that you've got to go out reach people you've
[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:15.360]  got to speak out you've got to be involved you've got to understand the more visible you are the
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:20.400]  more we'll show we're the majority that this system's a fraud and we'll defeat it they're in
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:24.960]  trouble right now and that's why they're accelerating their program kathryn i'm gonna come back
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:30.160]  we're gonna take some phone calls but do you briefly agree that humanity's on the march and
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:34.080]  we're starting to see the warm turn so here's the thing there's freedom and there's there's strength
[02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:38.080]  in numbers and this is the reason why they're manipulating what you see on the internet manipulating
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:41.520]  the polls so you think the numbers are on the other side so we you're absolutely right you
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:47.200]  absolutely nailed it we have got to be very visible very vocal show our numbers and show that we're
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:51.520]  not you know that there's doctors and lawyers and people with doctorates from harvard who are
[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:55.280]  saying these things so that there is strength in numbers but when it comes to your personal
[02:50:55.280 --> 02:51:00.160]  interest we have to go to break make it private absolutely do that personal stuff make it private

[02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:39.600]  encourage all the listeners to be making smart changes i was part of the initiative or supported
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:44.240]  the initiative at reset the net which was about getting people to switch over to encryption on
[02:55:44.240 --> 02:55:47.840]  the internet so what we're really doing we're keeping the internet we're building an encrypted
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:52.160]  layer on top of it and that's startpage.com which people should be using instead of google yahoo
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:57.280]  and bing that's start mail which has a two minute video i encourage people to go to startmail.com
[02:55:57.280 --> 02:56:02.960]  check out the video there and sign up to uh pre register or pre reserve an account when that comes
[02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:07.120]  out that's coming out soon we have 50 000 beta testers we thought we'd get a thousand i said
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:11.840]  let's beta test it okay we open it up we have 50 000 people we had to shut it down when we had so
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:14.960]  many people yeah that's exciting well tell me when you're ready to launch it we'll certainly
[02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:19.360]  want to have you back for that uh let's go to greg in california greg thanks for holding her on the
[02:56:19.360 --> 02:56:27.120]  air yeah salish jones uh i'm glad to finally be able to get a hold of you um i was calling basically
[02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:34.960]  to say hi to kathryn i think you said her name's kathryn yep right here uh yeah anyway uh i i agree
[02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:40.960]  with some of the uh things she said about the smart uh smart not phones but the homes i don't
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:44.800]  agree with that stuff because i don't want the government tracking my every sir i mean it's
[02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:48.960]  a hundred percent on record to dominate you control everything you do it's the problem i mean they
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:54.880]  admit that this is i mean yes you're right right so i got a couple of products you want to avoid one
[02:56:54.880 --> 02:56:59.440]  of them is google nest don't put a nest thermostat in your home because it's kind of the thin anything
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:04.640]  smart smart means slavery sir you said you disagree with something go ahead what go ahead you
[02:57:04.640 --> 02:57:10.480]  disagree no i i agree with what you're saying that uh that we don't need this tracking in our
[02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:14.720]  and our systems it's just too much espionage and spying on our own people and i think it's
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:21.760]  unconstitutional and i'm also a veteran of the military i retired in 2008 um and i was stationed
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:28.720]  at dies airport space in abalone and i wanted to mention that i remember when i worked there i worked
[02:57:28.720 --> 02:57:35.120]  in the w the wsa weapon storage area and i remember seeing radioactive symbols so to know that in our
[02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:41.600]  own heart and our own country that they stole nukes from there is a bad thing so i i agree with
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:47.200]  uh you guys and that's why i listen to you every day and i spread the word to all my friends that
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:53.840]  i know and family i tell them start listening to your show i tell them to get involved i even
[02:57:53.840 --> 02:57:58.480]  called the city council and told them i found out that before i had no water over here and the guy
[02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:03.920]  didn't want to do anything about it so i'm gonna keep doing what i gotta do i'm even growing my
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:10.160]  own vegetables i'm not buying a lot of them in the stores anymore but my thing is uh uh seeing

[02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:20.560]  i was in germany in 89 before the berlin walls came down and when i came home i told everybody

[03:00:51.920 --> 03:00:58.400]  we need this type of espionage against our own people see we're so tribal he's a smart guy and
[03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:03.520]  i'm this way too i keep saying we we we shouldn't be doing this in ukraine uh or we shouldn't be
[03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:09.520]  spying on our own people with these government systems and the smart meters and the rest of it
[03:01:09.520 --> 03:01:16.400]  the globalists have had a technotronic technocratic coup in their own words over the infrastructure
[03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:22.160]  that's why they want centralization that even bypasses government and they use perception

[03:01:26.560 --> 03:01:30.480]  no one would confirm it or make a big deal out of it i finally said let's go to the border and show
[03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:35.120]  this because a whistleblower calls us that i'm with ice they bring them in on buses we're forced
[03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:42.480]  to load them and take them and dump them off it became national news all because we were here
[03:01:42.480 --> 03:01:47.760]  which scares me because i'm rag tag folks i can't even respond to 10 percent of what's coming in
[03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:53.600]  i mean the stuff that's coming in is just crazy but it shows what you could do out there
[03:01:53.600 --> 03:02:00.080]  mainline talk show host get a camera get a crew put videos on youtube part of your radio show
[03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:06.160]  be the media it's a vacuum but but callers this is short segment long segment coming up with
[03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:13.120]  katherine here with us in studio but but greg other points or any comments you've got off what he
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:19.200]  said katherine uh yes there's there's something else i wanted to say too my wife went to a clinic
[03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:25.120]  to get her checkup and she's russian and she heard in russian they were asking these are doctors
[03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:31.280]  at the counter or the clerks asking if they own weapons and that to me shouldn't be going on either
[03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:37.360]  and i've i've witnessed it my wife told me about this so people going to clinics being asked these
[03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:42.480]  questions about whether they own guns is unconstitutional and i've witnessed it myself oh
[03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:48.560]  it's in obama it's in obama care it's it's it's this is it folks they are look this is it
[03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:52.480]  they're dropping the hammer katherine you agree with that statement yeah and when you mention
[03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:56.160]  obama care i just have to point out that i'm one of the people who completely lost my health
[03:02:56.160 --> 03:03:00.160]  coverage i am no longer able to receive the treatment that i received for the breast cancer
[03:03:00.160 --> 03:03:03.680]  that i'm going to be in treatment for for the rest of my life i literally had it taken away
[03:03:03.680 --> 03:03:07.920]  from me by obama care uh in the state of new hampshire now i'm not allowed to leave the state
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:11.360]  they turned our state into the reservation basically i can receive i can't even go over the
[03:03:11.360 --> 03:03:17.120]  border into massachusetts where i was treated so obama care nightmare top to bottom and i think
[03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:20.400]  as are they give us an extension but as that runs out at the end of the year i think you're
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:24.400]  going to see a huge amount of backlash as all of the people who had their care taken away from them
[03:03:24.400 --> 03:03:30.080]  are going to be um starting to but by then the world war three would have started i'm in the
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:34.080]  collapsed border see that's why they keep pushing it off because they know everybody's going to get
[03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:38.400]  mad well it's it's you push off the resistance so that you can get it in place and then it
[03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:41.760]  becomes entrenched and then when the resistance comes up there's really nothing you can do about
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:46.080]  it so i think that's why on on obama care they've just given us these extensions but the idea of
[03:03:46.080 --> 03:03:50.320]  asking people if they have firearms it it's not really unconstitutional it's unconstitutional
[03:03:50.320 --> 03:03:54.880]  for the government to tell doctors to do that and report back but here's the thing what what you
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:04:00.240]  choose to volunteer it's your compliance or a company or to the police or to the doctors these
[03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:04.960]  authority figures yeah when a cop asked me at a checkpoint to search my car i said are you looking
[03:04:04.960 --> 03:04:09.760]  for somebody do i match the description they go hey buddy i go hey i care about you and your family
[03:04:09.760 --> 03:04:13.840]  you know this is a bunch of bull now you ought to be ashamed of yourself you want to get a dog in here
[03:04:13.840 --> 03:04:18.240]  make a big issue out of this you know the government ships on narcotics in and the cop always goes
[03:04:18.240 --> 03:04:24.080]  just get out of here or they say no i know you're right you can go they're just following orders
[03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:28.320]  they're having their own future destroyed catherine yeah no i think it starts saying no doctor asked
[03:04:28.320 --> 03:04:32.960]  me that i'm just like none of your business bro so we need to learn how to say no to data request
[03:04:32.960 --> 03:04:36.800]  somebody asked for your age of burden your data oh yeah i never say no i just say no thank you
[03:04:36.800 --> 03:04:44.080]  oh they do it everywhere it's incredible and they also like you to beep at the gate to act
[03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:47.600]  like you're bad like i was at this place the other day buying stuff and i said i want you
[03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:51.520]  to scan all this so it doesn't beep and when it beeped and then ran up to me i said this is it
[03:04:51.520 --> 03:04:56.400]  get your manager i made a huge scene i said this is social engineering you don't even know it more

[03:09:29.440 --> 03:09:35.040]  with the income tax it's a fraud it's under the ucc and you could get two guys out of jail
[03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:44.240]  by using the ucc it's next congressman george hanson and urwin schiff is this urwin schiff
[03:09:45.680 --> 03:09:50.720]  no i'm not urwin schiff but urwin schiff in jail yes you are you don't want to get in trouble

[03:09:57.920 --> 03:10:04.000]  father who's in federal prison for writing a book about the irs paul and and you sound just like him
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:10.800]  well i i i want to i want to say something look i i thought these people and i found out about the
[03:10:10.800 --> 03:10:20.640]  ucc how they entrap you see all financials taxing uh transactions are done under the ucc
[03:10:21.680 --> 03:10:25.840]  and that's how they entrap you once you accept that 1040 formula dead in the water
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:32.080]  urwin how how did you get to how did you get to a telephone supposed to sign on the penalty
[03:10:32.080 --> 03:10:37.840]  for you that you owe the money and they don't do it if you're not urwin schiff i mean i mean you
[03:10:37.840 --> 03:10:43.600]  know your voice is almost identical to him right well i don't know why you're the ones telling me
[03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:50.080]  that but uh i call you before alex uh but i need to talk about this you could get these guys out
[03:10:50.080 --> 03:10:56.960]  of jail if you get enough people behind it see yonder ucc and trap you no listen it's a federal
[03:10:56.960 --> 03:11:03.200]  reserve it's private the income tax it's all a fraud that's on record and and it does show we're
[03:11:03.200 --> 03:11:08.560]  under financial bondage that's how they're able to do all this and you know urwin schiff literally
[03:11:08.560 --> 03:11:13.680]  wrote a book exposing it and the judge said don't publish it anymore and the judge they put him in
[03:11:13.680 --> 03:11:20.160]  prison for a book and they tried to put a former treasury agent who quit over all this uh joe
[03:11:20.160 --> 03:11:26.080]  banister in jail but the syria found him not guilty that's how scary this country is they wanted
[03:11:26.080 --> 03:11:32.640]  to arrest him for giving speeches they claimed that he was aiding and abetting people in fraud
[03:11:32.640 --> 03:11:38.080]  to tell him that it was all actually private but but it is on record do you believe that gather
[03:11:38.080 --> 03:11:43.200]  well anytime your own government is telling you you can't speak i mean the the whole thing about
[03:11:43.200 --> 03:11:48.000]  free speech if if they had a problem with it then they should say why it's wrong but not arrest people
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:52.560]  yeah i mean urwin schiff's been in jail it's got to be like 15 years and i've already many times
[03:11:52.560 --> 03:11:57.360]  he's to be on this radio network and of course his brother i mean his son peter schiff's very
[03:11:57.360 --> 03:12:04.160]  successful manages i think like five million dollars uh but uh it just shows how crazy this
[03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:10.560]  government is thank you paul good point micah california you're on the air hello alex dr
[03:12:10.560 --> 03:12:14.240]  albert you're both truly great americans and thanks for keeping up the good work i know you
[03:12:14.240 --> 03:12:18.080]  feel like you're banging your head against the wall sometimes but let me tell you we're waking up
[03:12:18.080 --> 03:12:23.520]  out here hey alex former marine former deputy sheriff i'd love to be one of your correspondents
[03:12:23.520 --> 03:12:29.200]  out here if you ever need it on another note that's uh i have a theory about what's going on at the
[03:12:29.200 --> 03:12:36.160]  border and uh i haven't heard anybody talking about it thousands of these people coming across the
[03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:43.200]  border are aged 15 to 17 years old what's to say so one of these terrorist organizations down south
[03:12:43.200 --> 03:12:49.360]  south america honduras are training these people to come up here and they're waiting until they have
[03:12:49.360 --> 03:12:57.200]  just enough enough of a group up here to do one great well sure sure sure of course no no no we've
[03:12:57.200 --> 03:13:01.600]  been saying that you must have missed it it's not your theory is correct it's not a theory
[03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:05.600]  they're bringing radical uh islamists across the border they found the literature of the
[03:13:05.600 --> 03:13:10.160]  prayer cloths they've apprehended them and then they're uh you know quietly shipping them out when
[03:13:10.160 --> 03:13:16.240]  they do local police and others and when the board patrol can uh and they're using these kids by the
[03:13:16.240 --> 03:13:22.320]  hundreds of thousands as mules with fake ids and fake names to launder money which we know the
[03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:28.480]  democrats and others are heavily involved in money laundering so so absolutely i mean look it just
[03:13:28.480 --> 03:13:34.320]  shows how out of control the system is they are absolutely correct and we're in dangerous times
[03:13:34.320 --> 03:13:38.960]  now if people need to wake up and people need to start paying attention and i'll keep their head
[03:13:38.960 --> 03:13:43.760]  on a 360 and and make sure that they're covering themselves exactly just because the board of
[03:13:43.760 --> 03:13:48.560]  patrol has been ordered to stand down on now publicly doesn't mean that sheriff's deputies
[03:13:48.560 --> 03:13:53.280]  can't stop criminals or police can't or citizens and i got to say i've been critical of rick perry
[03:13:53.280 --> 03:13:59.280]  but i learned that he very quietly and secretly uh through the state police sent thousands of
[03:13:59.280 --> 03:14:03.280]  state police down there in the last few months and they've been apprehending and running the records
[03:14:03.280 --> 03:14:08.480]  of these people that are the felons they're at least in the system and are taking them to mexico
[03:14:08.480 --> 03:14:14.160]  basically themselves and mexico's refusing them so the next big crisis is all these illegal felons
[03:14:14.160 --> 03:14:19.600]  building up that obama's about to release again but i'm surprised rick perry and the state police
[03:14:19.600 --> 03:14:26.000]  even did something good that's good i mean katherine boy that's that's probably not a topic i can say
[03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:29.760]  much about i live up in new hampshire where we don't have the border problems of people coming
[03:14:29.760 --> 03:14:33.600]  down from canada but i know certainly it's a big it's a big deal down here and it's a big deal for
[03:14:33.600 --> 03:14:39.920]  the whole country well yeah i mean latin america's collapsing i mean mexico is a failed state and it's
[03:14:39.920 --> 03:14:45.440]  now failing into us and uh you know i actually lived in mexico for a year when i was 15 i was a
[03:14:45.440 --> 03:14:51.280]  co-host on a mexican television show and i'm fluent in spanish so back in in in that era nice it was a
[03:14:51.280 --> 03:14:57.440]  very different place nice place and now i wouldn't go back even on vacation because it's been totally
[03:14:57.440 --> 03:15:02.720]  overrun by by the drug lords and yeah it's the corruption with the police who are part of that
[03:15:02.720 --> 03:15:08.400]  and the drug war did it safe it is yeah i mean we know the drug culture is bad i'm not endorsing it
[03:15:08.400 --> 03:15:13.200]  but at the top they run the drug war so they can launder the money and then it creates a criminal
[03:15:13.200 --> 03:15:18.560]  culture it's just and i'm not saying legalization of hard drugs is good either but it's better than
[03:15:18.560 --> 03:15:23.200]  prohibition well it's where the money is and so the the power will always go where the money is
[03:15:23.200 --> 03:15:27.520]  and if they can make it illegal so that they can make more money off of it then you know that's
[03:15:27.520 --> 03:15:32.160]  oh yeah no no i've been involved in documentaries where the drug lords admit yeah you follow the
[03:15:32.160 --> 03:15:38.000]  money that they wanted illegal i mean the prison company's lobby to keep it illegal so what do
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:42.080]  you think what do you make of george sorrell spending 80 million dollars to legalize marijuana
[03:15:42.080 --> 03:15:45.920]  now and that's one of the only good things he's ever done and that's a peak that's a well let me
[03:15:45.920 --> 03:15:54.560]  just finish that's a on the surface i was gonna that's a pr stunt total pr stunt to look like he
[03:15:54.560 --> 03:16:00.080]  but but the real reason is they're not really decriminalizing it you waive your rights in
[03:16:00.080 --> 03:16:04.000]  these states like michigan and colorada and california and get put on a list and now they
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:09.920]  come to your house whenever they want now they take your kids uh it's a trapped institutionalized
[03:16:09.920 --> 03:16:16.400]  medical marijuana users uh and as a way with this new super weed to basically turn people into zombies
[03:16:16.400 --> 03:16:19.840]  that's that's the thing that's what's got that's what i think is going on because george sorrell
[03:16:19.840 --> 03:16:24.720]  himself has said that he doesn't approve of pot smoking he doesn't want his family smoking pod he
[03:16:24.720 --> 03:16:30.000]  himself doesn't smoke pot but he wants you and your family smoking pod because the eight hours
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:34.160]  a day they want you cleaning up the roads and and and driving the buses and keeping the system going
[03:16:34.160 --> 03:16:38.560]  but in your off time they want you to plan world of warcraft like a zombie or i agree but you don't
[03:16:38.560 --> 03:16:44.400]  throw somebody in you don't throw somebody in prison for it though yeah well it's it's been um
[03:16:44.400 --> 03:16:48.800]  obviously that that's been a very powerful way to do asset forfeiture and also here's the deal
[03:16:48.800 --> 03:16:53.040]  here's the deal people want to drink drano and kill themselves i'm with you i'm also so and i
[03:16:53.040 --> 03:16:57.360]  totally believe that you should have let me tell you i've seen the new medical marijuana wreck people
[03:16:57.360 --> 03:17:03.280]  i mean i've known beautiful smart women who are like wreck zombies now i've known really smart
[03:17:03.280 --> 03:17:07.520]  businessmen who are zombies now well here's the thing what what does marijuana do it
[03:17:07.520 --> 03:17:11.360]  it millers you out it makes you mellow there's there's a reason why we have this sort of stereotype
[03:17:11.360 --> 03:17:14.960]  of the laid-back pothead because they're not the kind of people who are going to take a
[03:17:14.960 --> 03:17:18.080]  picket sign and go and actually make some change they're not the kind of people who are gonna i
[03:17:18.080 --> 03:17:23.120]  mean some of them some of them do don't get me wrong but as a whole if you took the entire american
[03:17:23.120 --> 03:17:27.600]  population and had them all smoking pot every night it would be like soma from brave new world
[03:17:27.600 --> 03:17:31.520]  it just mellows people here's the deal they're coming out right back i've confirmed it's the
[03:17:31.520 --> 03:17:36.320]  big story we're working on they've already got the gmo's strains they're being probably done in labs
[03:17:36.320 --> 03:17:41.120]  that's going to be scary this is not marijuana this is not marijuana genome of it absolutely
[03:17:41.120 --> 03:17:44.800]  and and the second piece of that is all the video games that are so incredibly addictive
[03:17:44.800 --> 03:17:49.520]  those they they've actually taken psychological insights that have been developed over decades
[03:17:49.520 --> 03:17:53.680]  and incorporated them of addiction oh yeah who's that who's that expert lady on you have i want
[03:17:53.680 --> 03:17:57.520]  to tell the guys her name i want to get her on the one about the addiction i've had a couple on
[03:17:57.520 --> 03:18:01.920]  talking about it i know so many women who are leaving their husbands because because they just
[03:18:01.920 --> 03:18:05.920]  want to play video games yeah yeah and and i and they'll always say you know somebody you know that's
[03:18:05.920 --> 03:18:10.000]  a video game head they'll go hey it's my life not a problem with it and i'm like hey i'm just
[03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:15.040]  telling you it was developed by darpa to literally turn you into a zombie you know so okay well and
[03:18:15.040 --> 03:18:18.800]  and what happens is that you know you look at all the mass shooters and they were all heavy
[03:18:18.800 --> 03:18:22.880]  video game players because you're developing a skill and when you develop a skill i mean if i were
[03:18:22.880 --> 03:18:27.120]  taking guitar lessons i'd want to get up on a stage and play guitar so if i'm playing these
[03:18:27.120 --> 03:18:31.760]  games all day long and learning how to kill at some point that's a skill you've developed and
[03:18:31.760 --> 03:18:35.520]  there's a certain percentage of people that go why am i just wasting my time practicing this skill
[03:18:35.520 --> 03:18:39.760]  here when i can go out and actually do it and so i yeah it's like dad giving you a playboy when
[03:18:39.760 --> 03:18:45.600]  you're 14 but but but but you know i'm joking no but the whole point is i'm talking about
[03:18:45.600 --> 03:18:51.600]  about a joke in it he's gonna be pleasure did that well this is a joke it's a joke the point is
[03:18:51.600 --> 03:18:56.160]  is that is that they're basically well they had studies that prove that the dare program we're
[03:18:56.160 --> 03:19:00.880]  going to skip this network break into one more segment they had uh you know studies out there
[03:19:00.880 --> 03:19:06.080]  that death education in schools cause more suicide like don't commit suicide here's how to do it
[03:19:06.080 --> 03:19:11.840]  2020 even admitted a doubling and tripling of suicide the dare program taught kids how to use drugs
[03:19:11.840 --> 03:19:18.640]  yeah no it's it's the focus on this stuff and i i how many ways can they get us to zone out
[03:19:20.080 --> 03:19:24.240]  they don't care if you're angry they don't care if you know they care if you do something about it
[03:19:24.240 --> 03:19:28.160]  that's really the key and so people need to understand you can be as informed as you want but
[03:19:28.160 --> 03:19:32.560]  if you're sitting around you know like a stoner talking to your buddies over you know over a beer
[03:19:32.560 --> 03:19:37.040]  instead of actually signing petitions and making changes and going out there that's what i tell
[03:19:37.040 --> 03:19:41.600]  my crew they're incredibly actively do a great job we can all do better myself included i'll
[03:19:41.600 --> 03:19:46.880]  hear these great discussions of story ideas and things that are going on in the coffee room or in
[03:19:46.880 --> 03:19:52.080]  but it 90% of the time it's between them it never goes anywhere yeah and i'm like hey the
[03:19:52.080 --> 03:19:56.480]  universe is out there we got to get this going outside of here we got to have a public discussion
[03:19:56.480 --> 03:20:00.640]  about this and then put it into action yeah that's why i'm not a big fan of pot smoking i think it
[03:20:00.640 --> 03:20:03.840]  should be legal because i'm a libertarian and i don't think the government should use guns and
[03:20:03.840 --> 03:20:08.320]  tanks to tell you what i agree but it's a personal choice it's probably not the best one if you want
[03:20:08.320 --> 03:20:14.000]  to actually have an impact on the world but see it's a it's a cult too because then i've been in
[03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:18.240]  all these films about decriminalization and stuff and then people go man why don't you think it's a
[03:20:18.240 --> 03:20:24.480]  good culture then 80 million dollars that george surrow spent to fund the grassroots organizations
[03:20:24.480 --> 03:20:28.960]  to build up this kind of motion around it this kind of by the way let's talk about who he is
[03:20:28.960 --> 03:20:33.040]  he's really a Rothschild front on record that's even come out in the british news the rothschild
[03:20:33.040 --> 03:20:38.720]  suit over it lost the lawsuit and the judge said wow this this lawsuit basically proved you're like
[03:20:38.720 --> 03:20:44.000]  evil masterminds and sorrows is their front man a nazi collaborator they hired for bizarre reasons
[03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:49.920]  to run things he's given darpa intel everything he does is key arab spring he's behind the open
[03:20:49.920 --> 03:20:55.360]  borders right now to collapse things he's he brags he's behind the ukraine takeover i mean this guy
[03:20:55.360 --> 03:21:00.800]  is literally like a james bond super villain so you're right why is he behind legalized in the
[03:21:00.800 --> 03:21:04.720]  weed 80 million dollars think about how much money that is wait what could you do with it
[03:21:04.720 --> 03:21:08.560]  i'll tell you cuz it makes the country a better place no no no they promote it make it acceptable
[03:21:08.560 --> 03:21:14.240]  to get more people on it make it more available so i was for decriminalization now i realize
[03:21:14.240 --> 03:21:20.240]  with their humet super science systems they went above that and are making an institutional with
[03:21:20.240 --> 03:21:26.000]  weapons grade pot to then make it acceptable put it in stores everywhere and literally zombo
[03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:30.480]  everybody zombify the whole country and have us once again it's back to what i was saying earlier
[03:21:30.480 --> 03:21:34.640]  it's the get you to embrace your chains if they said hey everybody you're gonna have to take a
[03:21:34.640 --> 03:21:38.960]  soma pill after you get off work that's gonna zone you out for six seven hours a night so you
[03:21:38.960 --> 03:21:43.600]  don't mess with us we'd be up in arms but if they say hey we're we're gonna do what you want we're
[03:21:43.600 --> 03:21:47.200]  gonna you know don't throw me in the briar patch we're gonna we're gonna give you what you want
[03:21:47.200 --> 03:21:52.160]  reluctantly but we'll give it to you and we'll let you smoke pot all night long how do we win with
[03:21:52.160 --> 03:21:56.560]  that how do we and again that doesn't mean there aren't people like george washington they call it
[03:21:56.560 --> 03:22:00.560]  toothache weed or stomach egg weed because the most it was hemp you know they call that like shale
[03:22:00.560 --> 03:22:06.960]  or rope hemp but they had the toothache hemp and called weed and and the apothecaries would say
[03:22:06.960 --> 03:22:13.680]  for your stomach take this you know for your tooth hurting smoke this so but that was probably 50
[03:22:13.680 --> 03:22:19.120]  times not as strong exactly and when you gmo modify this stuff i it there's no telling what
[03:22:19.120 --> 03:22:23.120]  they could do to it i mean you could smoke this stuff and never come back i don't know i don't
[03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:27.280]  know what's coming we'll see that's the that's why they're promoting it now and so we have to
[03:22:27.280 --> 03:22:32.880]  understand the old police state models bad but the new models bad too and see people think no it's
[03:22:32.880 --> 03:22:37.840]  one or the other alex why are you against marijuana you police state thug what is your problem i'm
[03:22:37.840 --> 03:22:43.760]  like i'm not for putin and i'm not for obama no you're for putin or you're you're for obama you
[03:22:43.760 --> 03:22:49.680]  you've got to choose a side no you got to see all of it dichotomies artificial like the republican
[03:22:49.680 --> 03:22:53.680]  or democrat and the reality is is neither side is your friend they're both going to take away
[03:22:53.680 --> 03:22:57.360]  your freedoms exactly there is no left and right there's just freedom and control and those guys
[03:22:57.360 --> 03:23:02.720]  are on the control side so these artificial i mean think about republican democrat who
[03:23:02.720 --> 03:23:09.280]  who came up with the idea that it is okay to kill a baby but not okay to go to war here's an example
[03:23:09.280 --> 03:23:13.360]  that it's okay to go to war but you can't kill a baby i mean it's not okay to kill period exactly
[03:23:13.360 --> 03:23:18.080]  i'm not up for that well it's not good to murder and call blood it's good to defend yourself yeah
[03:23:18.080 --> 03:23:21.680]  expanding on that and then we'll take a few final calls i'm sorry folks this is an interesting
[03:23:21.680 --> 03:23:27.360]  conversation i'm literally like police that they have go smoke marijuana to see what it's really
[03:23:27.360 --> 03:23:34.000]  like so they can recognize it i will smoke it maybe once a year and it's also varied sometimes
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:37.600]  i've smoked medical grade marijuana that actually hypes you up and you can really think well but
[03:23:37.600 --> 03:23:43.680]  only a few times almost all of what's out there because i'll be at a park and and you know 20
[03:23:43.680 --> 03:23:47.120]  year olds are smoking pot and i'll say let me have a head off that just randomly once a year
[03:23:47.120 --> 03:23:54.960]  i've smoked pot that the teenagers are smoking on the street and literally can't think a day later
[03:23:54.960 --> 03:24:01.760]  off one hit that's how strong this stuff is and i mean hating it hating it the next day that i
[03:24:01.760 --> 03:24:06.640]  can't think so i mean that it's it's powerful so you take your population and you make sure that
[03:24:06.640 --> 03:24:12.560]  nine to five they sweep the roads make sure that nine to five they do the the basic things to keep
[03:24:12.560 --> 03:24:17.840]  a nice world for the the puns come to live in but then you want them knocked out you want
[03:24:17.840 --> 03:24:22.880]  them out of the game for the rest of the time so i don't know you do your mileage may vary i say
[03:24:22.880 --> 03:24:27.680]  everybody do your own thing not not really my business but take a look at the people you know
[03:24:27.680 --> 03:24:31.840]  who are heavy pot smokers and cheeses are pretty good that they're not out there making social
[03:24:31.840 --> 03:24:35.680]  change in the world well some people can smoke a little bit of it who are high strung from what
[03:24:35.680 --> 03:24:40.560]  i've read and talked to folks and and and they're moderate about it it's not that bad you know
[03:24:40.560 --> 03:24:43.600]  it's like people have a few glasses of wine it's like a video game if you're playing world of
[03:24:43.600 --> 03:24:47.920]  warcraft 16 hours a day for seven days a week then you're going to lose your marriage you're
[03:24:47.920 --> 03:24:50.320]  going to lose your job you're going to lose everything you're going to be living in your
[03:24:50.320 --> 03:24:56.160]  mother's basement you know weighing 300 pounds but if you play get if you can play a video game
[03:24:56.160 --> 03:24:59.760]  a couple hours a week it's not a big deal hey listen in my house i have one of those master
[03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:04.240]  consoles that cost a couple thousand bucks there's like 30 old-fashioned video games on it and maybe
[03:25:04.240 --> 03:25:09.920]  when friends come over once a month we'll go up for 30 minutes and just as a nostalgia you know
[03:25:09.920 --> 03:25:14.160]  it's more of a novelty like you have time to play video games alex seriously well it's good
[03:25:14.160 --> 03:25:19.200]  to have a distraction sometimes yeah absolutely and and we only play missile command play backman
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:23.120]  but don't take a break by shooting heroin don't take a break with things that we know are addictive
[03:25:23.120 --> 03:25:27.280]  that are bit that are specifically developed to be maximally addictive they took research from
[03:25:27.280 --> 03:25:32.320]  looking at gamblers in vegas which they use to make things more addictive to you and they incorporated
[03:25:32.320 --> 03:25:37.920]  all of those things into these videos and into fast food and and people that are the chemicals
[03:25:37.920 --> 03:25:42.400]  people that are enslaved to this literally will think we're telling them what to do but hey i eat
[03:25:42.400 --> 03:25:46.720]  too much you know there's been times when i've drank too much whatever i mean we all need to
[03:25:46.720 --> 03:25:50.800]  help each other but no when you're being manipulated into thinking that you're getting something
[03:25:50.800 --> 03:25:55.920]  wonderful thinking that you're getting more freedom like the cell phone and and instead
[03:25:55.920 --> 03:26:00.480]  be getting less freedom because it's no longer the guns and tanks pointed at you forcing you to
[03:26:00.480 --> 03:26:04.480]  do these things now they get you to think that it was your idea in the first place i lost my cell
[03:26:04.480 --> 03:26:09.040]  phone three days ago and i gotta tell you i'm not missing it i gotta go get it turned off or
[03:26:09.040 --> 03:26:14.960]  something but i got a backup over there but i mean i know it's an enemy weapon a trojan horse
[03:26:14.960 --> 03:26:19.200]  given to me i use it for youtube videos and things i know it's just like the video games use it in
[03:26:19.200 --> 03:26:24.560]  moderation use it well i only use it because it's a powerful weapon and i and i literally when i
[03:26:24.560 --> 03:26:29.360]  want to have a private conversation it goes out of the room uh let's go to chris chris and nevada
[03:26:29.360 --> 03:26:35.200]  i apologize you're on the air go ahead well not a problem alex what a fantastic pleasure to be on
[03:26:35.200 --> 03:26:43.200]  with two the top truth advocates on gcm live broadcasting truth in the empire of lies well
[03:26:43.200 --> 03:26:50.640]  that guy's do a liner for thank you thank you oh well it is a distinct pleasure you know kathryn
[03:26:50.640 --> 03:26:56.080]  you being from harvard you probably are familiar with the joseph gerbil and edwin bernays tell a
[03:26:56.080 --> 03:27:02.480]  lie often enough and they'll begin to believe it's the truth yes it works and and even if you don't
[03:27:02.480 --> 03:27:06.880]  believe it tell people that everybody else believes it and then you'll think that resistance is futile
[03:27:06.880 --> 03:27:10.640]  and there's no point fighting back which is why the defense department is involved in that kind of
[03:27:10.640 --> 03:27:14.320]  research to make sure that they can manipulate the internet so you believe you're alone it's it's
[03:27:14.320 --> 03:27:17.920]  all part of but i'll tell you i've seen scyop meetings on c-span where they have the scyops
[03:27:17.920 --> 03:27:21.520]  division and they're on television saying they're gonna stop lying to us everybody look completely
[03:27:21.520 --> 03:27:26.400]  depressed and freaked out because that was the public rollout line was it was the well no it was
[03:27:26.400 --> 03:27:31.840]  the public rollout of total lying them saying we're going to be in your neighborhood now we
[03:27:31.840 --> 03:27:37.360]  promise to stop lying it was we admit that you don't trust us now you can trust us just so you
[03:27:37.360 --> 03:27:42.960]  lower your shield they can stab you yeah yeah no i anytime their lips are moving i'm i'm suspicious
[03:27:42.960 --> 03:27:48.000]  well god bless you sir i'm gonna try to jam in one more jamming else chris well i did want to say
[03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:53.360]  that stalin always says that the best way to control the opposition is to be the opposition
[03:27:53.360 --> 03:27:58.960]  i think that's what very precisely we're seeing with this ukraine thing and also with the over
[03:27:58.960 --> 03:28:03.760]  the border thing with the organizer in chief absolutely they create the crisis offer the
