[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.160 --> 00:19.680]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.680 --> 00:30.280]  Alex Jones well we've got another jam-packed logcast lined up for you today we
[00:30.280 --> 00:36.960]  have Mark Crutcher the filmmaker of MAFA 21 black genocide the 21st century
[00:36.960 --> 00:42.120]  America getting into the eugenicist because it dovetails with headlines like
[00:42.120 --> 00:46.720]  this one Beckham's a bad example for families and calls to make it the law
[00:46.720 --> 00:51.840]  that you can't have more than two children you know how dare people have
[00:51.840 --> 00:57.440]  children I want to look at eugenics and why the shadow government military
[00:57.440 --> 01:01.880]  industrial complex is spiking the food the water with sterilence and car
[01:01.880 --> 01:05.960]  synergents and the most important information we could cover we are going
[01:05.960 --> 01:15.760]  to be covering today with our guest big news bullet tax proposed in Baltimore a
[01:15.760 --> 01:19.800]  dollar per bullet this is the way they're planning to strangle of the
[01:19.800 --> 01:23.280]  second amendment will continue to look at operation fast and furious and the
[01:23.280 --> 01:28.920]  fact that it ties directly to the White House shipping guns all over Latin
[01:28.920 --> 01:33.520]  America not just Mexico as a pretext to knock out their competition in the drug
[01:33.520 --> 01:37.520]  trade and also blame the second amendment for violence in Mexico and
[01:37.520 --> 01:43.320]  south of that southern North American country Rupert Murdoch just minutes ago
[01:43.320 --> 01:48.680]  is being grilled by a parliamentary inquiry in the United Kingdom and
[01:48.680 --> 01:54.320]  someone tried to throw a white powder on him and failed and that is just
[01:54.320 --> 01:59.240]  breaking so we'll continue to track that as it unfolds you know Princess Diana
[01:59.240 --> 02:02.640]  told her butler and friends he made a videotape that the government
[02:02.640 --> 02:06.040]  confiscated they were unable to get her diary that also said the same thing that
[02:06.040 --> 02:11.240]  Charles has told me he's going to kill me in a stage auto accident that's a
[02:11.240 --> 02:16.360]  favorite intelligence agency way to kill you to see I am I six favorite and even
[02:16.360 --> 02:19.640]  despite the fact that then there was evidence they did murder her the
[02:19.640 --> 02:23.640]  government inquest said that no such thing happened at the Easter Bunny was
[02:23.640 --> 02:28.160]  indeed real same thing happened with the Hutton inquiry with Dr. David Kelly who
[02:28.160 --> 02:31.680]  was going to blow the whistle on no WMDs in Iraq he was the head WMD
[02:31.680 --> 02:35.640]  inspector out of England of the UN they of course murdered him even though he
[02:35.640 --> 02:39.000]  told folks quote I've been threatened I'll be found dead in the woods he was
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.320]  found dead in the woods continuing as somebody's coming to get me terrified
[02:43.320 --> 02:48.000]  phone hacking whistleblower from news of the world feared for his life before he
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.720]  was found dead in the middle of this giant scandal that could bring down the
[02:51.720 --> 02:56.280]  Prime Minister David Cameron with calls for his resignation calls for Murdoch
[02:56.280 --> 03:01.240]  to stand down and the fact that the two major police chiefs of both the Scotland
[03:01.240 --> 03:05.640]  Yard and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner had to stand down and
[03:05.640 --> 03:11.280]  others the head of news corps over in England has been arrested none of that
[03:11.280 --> 03:16.760]  matters because the police say from the minutes after finding the dead body that
[03:16.760 --> 03:20.360]  they don't think foul plays involved kind of like the girlfriend of the big
[03:20.360 --> 03:26.040]  pharmacological CEO out in LA who was found hanging bound and gagged dead from
[03:26.040 --> 03:31.800]  the front railing days after the kid fell down the stairs and died no big
[03:31.800 --> 03:35.720]  deal you got deaths going on in a house kids falling downstairs dying people
[03:35.720 --> 03:39.120]  hanging from ropes dead I mean you might as well have Freddy Krueger dancing
[03:39.120 --> 03:42.920]  around slicing people up on television they'll say it's a natural cause of
[03:42.920 --> 03:46.800]  death and you know they shot gun you twice in the head like Gary Webb for
[03:46.800 --> 03:51.000]  exposing CIA drug trafficking I mean ladies and gentlemen they could find me
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.600]  you know cut up in little pieces in a bag and they'd say that I committed
[03:54.600 --> 04:00.680]  suicide I will never commit suicide never never never never if I get cancer I
[04:00.680 --> 04:05.080]  will fight it like Darth Vader I will I will I will go through every regimen
[04:05.080 --> 04:09.100]  there is the hang on the lives because I love it and I want to continue to fight
[04:09.100 --> 04:13.280]  the globalist I will never never never never never never never never never
[04:13.280 --> 04:17.080]  never never never never never never never never never never never never
[04:17.080 --> 04:21.040]  never never never never never never never never never never never no matter
[04:21.040 --> 04:27.400]  what anybody says after the fact commit suicide never never never never never
[04:27.400 --> 04:30.120]  never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never,
[04:30.120 --> 04:32.640]  never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never,
[04:32.640 --> 04:33.640]  never.
[04:33.640 --> 04:38.980]  Now that seems obnoxious to say never 27 times, but the reason I did is because the DC Madame
[04:38.980 --> 04:41.880]  on my show said she would never commit suicide.
[04:41.880 --> 04:44.560]  Her landlord said she was being followed and being threatened.
[04:44.560 --> 04:46.560]  She was taking documents to her mom's house for her.
[04:46.560 --> 04:50.360]  She went to prison as she was found hung in her shed at mommy's house.
[04:50.360 --> 04:54.480]  Then they had some so-called friend who didn't even know her pop up and say, oh, she said
[04:54.480 --> 04:56.000]  she was going to commit suicide.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.600]  So if that ever happens, that person's a dirty globalist agent and a liar.
[05:00.600 --> 05:06.080]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[05:06.080 --> 05:08.800]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[05:08.800 --> 05:11.360]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[05:11.360 --> 05:15.080]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care
[05:15.080 --> 05:16.760]  of your health and your own family.
[05:16.760 --> 05:19.760]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[05:19.760 --> 05:22.120]  The crazy part is he's usually right.
[05:22.120 --> 05:26.320]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[05:26.320 --> 05:28.360]  mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[05:28.360 --> 05:31.640]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[05:31.640 --> 05:35.760]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[05:35.760 --> 05:38.960]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[05:38.960 --> 05:40.460]  I can't stress this enough.
[05:40.460 --> 05:43.120]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[05:43.120 --> 05:47.360]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[05:47.360 --> 05:54.640]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com, that's End of America, the number 3.com.
[05:54.640 --> 06:00.400]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com, that's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[06:00.400 --> 06:05.040]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[06:05.040 --> 06:09.380]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[06:09.380 --> 06:13.680]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[06:13.680 --> 06:15.000]  allows you to have.
[06:15.000 --> 06:19.640]  That's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[06:19.640 --> 06:20.720]  is coming.
[06:20.720 --> 06:25.040]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[06:25.040 --> 06:29.040]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[06:29.040 --> 06:32.520]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[06:32.520 --> 06:36.240]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[06:36.240 --> 06:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.760]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[06:44.760 --> 06:46.160]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[06:46.160 --> 06:52.040]  You can get more information at www.MySolarBackup.com, that's MySolarBackup.com.
[06:52.040 --> 07:01.760]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to MySolarBackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[07:01.760 --> 07:05.520]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[07:05.520 --> 07:08.680]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[07:08.680 --> 07:13.040]  Is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[07:13.040 --> 07:14.040]  at home?
[07:14.040 --> 07:19.200]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[07:19.200 --> 07:20.200]  shots.
[07:20.200 --> 07:25.040]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[07:25.040 --> 07:28.320]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[07:28.320 --> 07:34.160]  The criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[07:34.160 --> 07:35.160]  world government.
[07:35.160 --> 07:39.520]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[07:39.520 --> 07:41.520]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[07:41.520 --> 07:47.520]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[07:47.520 --> 07:48.520]  of the Republic.
[07:48.520 --> 07:53.520]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[07:53.520 --> 08:21.800]  We're watching online right now at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[08:23.520 --> 08:32.400]  We are live, my friends.
[08:32.400 --> 08:39.000]  It is Tuesday, the 19th day of July, 2011.
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.600]  Rupert Murdoch had somebody try to throw, it appears to be a small pie on him during
[08:44.600 --> 08:50.360]  the parliamentary inquiry into the hacking scandal, threatening to bring down the news
[08:50.360 --> 08:55.960]  core empire in the United Kingdom and perhaps worldwide with criminal investigations now
[08:55.960 --> 09:02.840]  opened, not just in the U.K., but also in Australia and moves to do so here in the United States.
[09:02.840 --> 09:07.680]  Now with all of that said, the White House has announced they're going to leave at least
[09:07.680 --> 09:13.400]  15,000 troops permanently in Iraq and is renaming them diplomats.
[09:13.400 --> 09:18.800]  Kind of like a year and a half ago, they renamed the 50,000 combat troops, combat support troops.
[09:18.800 --> 09:22.680]  So more lawyering, more semantical games.
[09:22.680 --> 09:28.200]  And in Paul Watson's article that we'll be going over later, he breaks down the fact
[09:28.200 --> 09:35.840]  that Bob Baer, former high-level CIA officer, and Debka Fowle, which is an Israeli intelligence
[09:35.840 --> 09:41.520]  linked group and others, are saying that the war is on for September against Iran.
[09:41.520 --> 09:45.640]  Now that doesn't mean that's going to happen, but the military has been told that Israel
[09:45.640 --> 09:51.440]  is planning strikes against their nuclear facilities, their power-generating facilities,
[09:51.440 --> 09:54.360]  and their enrichment facilities coming up in September.
[09:54.360 --> 09:59.160]  Now the military has been told that U.S. troops are going to go in in late September, early
[09:59.160 --> 10:03.720]  October into Libya, but now the French and the Italians have come out who've been driving
[10:03.720 --> 10:07.640]  the war and have said, give him time to step down.
[10:07.640 --> 10:09.760]  And reportedly he's talking about stepping down.
[10:09.760 --> 10:13.000]  The reason that has some credibility now, previously they said he was going to step
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.000]  down in the last four months, it wasn't true, is because they're calling for a ceasefire
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.560]  while they either jockey their rebel al-Qaeda forces around, that the White House is now
[10:24.560 --> 10:29.040]  officially recognized as the government, or because they are planning to let him have
[10:29.040 --> 10:34.520]  some type of exit strategy or stratagem out of the country, and that would certainly be
[10:34.520 --> 10:35.520]  a good thing.
[10:35.520 --> 10:40.840]  I'd rather not have a new war over there, even though it means the globalists will
[10:40.840 --> 10:47.440]  grab tens of billions in gold and take control of the largest oil supply in Africa and then
[10:47.440 --> 10:51.560]  suppress the pumping of the oil so they can artificially jack up prices.
[10:51.560 --> 10:57.600]  I would really like to not see a new war over there in North Africa and a lot of dead U.S.
[10:57.600 --> 11:04.800]  troops and dead Libyans, so that is certainly some good news on that front.
[11:04.800 --> 11:15.920]  Moving into the latest news on the whole phone hacking situation, you know, the top police
[11:15.920 --> 11:17.920]  chief of Scotland Yard stepped down over the weekend.
[11:17.920 --> 11:22.760]  The head of News Corp over in the U.K. was arrested.
[11:22.760 --> 11:27.560]  Now the head of the Metropolitan Police, the police commissioner, has also been forced
[11:27.560 --> 11:32.720]  to step down due to connections to reported bribery.
[11:32.720 --> 11:37.640]  And this is how the whole thing works, and there's a lot of old news coming out now resurfacing
[11:37.640 --> 11:43.320]  about news of the world hooked into British intelligence and military intelligence digging
[11:43.320 --> 11:46.160]  up dirt on politicians during the 1990s.
[11:46.160 --> 11:51.640]  And this is basically like WikiLeaks, but an old tech version of it where different
[11:51.640 --> 11:57.880]  branches of government want to sabotage each other generally so they can climb the ladder
[11:57.880 --> 11:59.520]  and get into power.
[11:59.520 --> 12:04.920]  It's all part of backstabbing, and so instead of having WikiLeaks release information to
[12:04.920 --> 12:13.200]  engage in infighting, they would have news of the world and other tabloids do it.
[12:13.200 --> 12:15.840]  And of course the Metropolitan Police are involved.
[12:15.840 --> 12:18.120]  Of course Scotland Yard is involved.
[12:18.120 --> 12:23.960]  Of course British intelligence is involved, and this is a labor party backed up by BBC
[12:23.960 --> 12:31.840]  Fight against the Tories backed up by News Corps that is taking over the media, and BBC
[12:31.840 --> 12:36.440]  is scared and has literally a fraction of the listeners and viewers they had just a
[12:36.440 --> 12:37.600]  decade ago.
[12:37.600 --> 12:41.560]  And so this is an attempt to keep state-run media in charge.
[12:41.560 --> 12:42.560]  Either way it's bad.
[12:42.560 --> 12:47.200]  I mean you've got the neocon arm, and you've got the liberal, Fabian socialist arm, and
[12:47.200 --> 12:55.160]  they're just running around fighting with each other, but make no mistake that at the
[12:55.160 --> 13:04.760]  end of the day here, this is nothing but an internal fight going on.
[13:04.760 --> 13:08.400]  And you know George Soros is heavily hooked up with the Labor Party.
[13:08.400 --> 13:11.920]  Gordon Brown, the globalist, the Fabian socialist.
[13:11.920 --> 13:17.600]  On the U.S. front we have had media matters now reportedly over a year ago, but it came
[13:17.600 --> 13:19.920]  out a few months ago in Politico.
[13:19.920 --> 13:24.280]  The documents, the memos for media matters saying we will physically infiltrate News
[13:24.280 --> 13:29.720]  Corps, Fox News, we will sabotage it, we will destroy it.
[13:29.720 --> 13:36.040]  We will go in and get employed there, and we will sabotage them.
[13:36.040 --> 13:38.560]  And that is espionage.
[13:38.560 --> 13:43.840]  And that's publicly admitted, and I pointed that out at the time that it was criminal,
[13:43.840 --> 13:46.720]  and pointed out that if anybody else did this it would be illegal.
[13:46.720 --> 13:51.120]  What do you think Fox News and its European subsidiaries are doing?
[13:51.120 --> 13:55.480]  They're phone hacking, they're breaking in, they're tracking politicians, they're getting
[13:55.480 --> 13:59.120]  fed dirt by police as part of a political manipulation.
[13:59.120 --> 14:02.220]  And that's illegal, and they should be punished for it.
[14:02.220 --> 14:07.840]  But media matters is on record with that memo that they openly bragged about once it got
[14:07.840 --> 14:13.560]  leaked, probably by them, because it's a positive article in Politico, and that's a tactic.
[14:13.560 --> 14:17.300]  They knew this was going to come out, so they had Politico come out and report on it like
[14:17.300 --> 14:23.640]  it was a wonderful, cutesy thing to do, oh look, they're going to infiltrate, oh look,
[14:23.640 --> 14:31.280]  they're going to get into News Corps and destroy them from within.
[14:31.280 --> 14:32.280]  I mean, that's illegal.
[14:32.280 --> 14:39.160]  I mean, if a memo came out that say, I have people working for me at Info Wars, and I
[14:39.160 --> 14:46.600]  said, let's get jobs at the Austin American statesman, and let's dig up dirt on them internally,
[14:46.600 --> 14:48.480]  but also let's sabotage them.
[14:48.480 --> 14:50.520]  Our mission is to destroy them.
[14:50.520 --> 14:55.800]  I would be arrested for racketeering organized crime, and I should be.
[14:55.800 --> 14:59.480]  That is racketeering, that is organized crime.
[14:59.480 --> 15:08.120]  That is sabotage, if I climb the fence hypothetically, let's say I had a company that sold natural
[15:08.120 --> 15:12.200]  gas, and I had trucks that went around town, and if I climbed the fence of my competitor
[15:12.200 --> 15:16.560]  in the middle of the night, and went in and sabotaged equipment, and then called in safety
[15:16.560 --> 15:23.080]  violations to the state board that deals with safety, and then had them shut down for a
[15:23.080 --> 15:27.880]  few days, it was in the news that they had safety violations, and they lost customers.
[15:27.880 --> 15:34.840]  If I was caught, I would be charged with organized crime, racketeering, and sabotage.
[15:34.840 --> 15:37.520]  These are serious hardcore felonies.
[15:37.520 --> 15:39.560]  If you did that, you would be.
[15:39.560 --> 15:41.840]  In fact, I meant to do it yesterday.
[15:41.840 --> 15:44.720]  I'm going to cover this more later in the broadcast, coming up the third hour.
[15:44.720 --> 15:49.160]  I'm going to reprint that politico, because I want to read from the memo itself.
[15:49.160 --> 15:50.160]  I forget the exact headline.
[15:50.160 --> 15:57.080]  If you want to pull it up, it was something like, media matters, memo, infiltrate, Fox
[15:57.080 --> 16:03.120]  News, destroy it from within, and you can pull up the politico article that has the
[16:03.120 --> 16:10.280]  memo in it, and so my point is, there it is, media matters, war against Fox, and that
[16:10.280 --> 16:17.360]  came out a few months ago, and you can just pull that article up.
[16:17.360 --> 16:21.280]  That was from March 26th, I guess four or five months ago, time flies, and so there
[16:21.280 --> 16:24.840]  it is, we're going to print that and later cover it, so that's what I had to say about
[16:24.840 --> 16:25.840]  this.
[16:25.840 --> 16:32.080]  We're going to prosecute Rupert Murdoch to the fullest extent of the law, but at the
[16:32.080 --> 16:38.360]  same time, we need to see a prosecution of George Soros' outfit, media matters.
[16:38.360 --> 16:44.040]  I mean, the thing is tax exempt, when they are a ardent political arm of the Obama administration
[16:44.040 --> 16:49.920]  on record and brag that they get walking orders and marching orders from the White House,
[16:49.920 --> 16:54.400]  and they're funded by George Soros, and they're saying infiltrate and destroy media companies
[16:54.400 --> 16:59.360]  – that's what's going on with News Corp.
[16:59.360 --> 17:04.920]  Now I told you last week, over a week ago, in fact it'd be great if YouTubers on the
[17:04.920 --> 17:08.880]  Alex Jones channel would pull up that, because I don't have the staff to sit there and show
[17:08.880 --> 17:13.640]  you every week how I was right last week, and I said, listen, this goes a lot deeper
[17:13.640 --> 17:15.160]  with what's happening at News Corp.
[17:15.160 --> 17:17.360]  It's an internal fight.
[17:17.360 --> 17:21.400]  If you're in good stead with the globalist, they will let you engage basically in bloody
[17:21.400 --> 17:22.400]  murder.
[17:22.400 --> 17:23.960]  It's impossible to get in trouble.
[17:23.960 --> 17:25.400]  This is an internal fight.
[17:25.400 --> 17:30.520]  And I said, don't make no mistake, major corporations, Fortune 100 especially, most
[17:30.520 --> 17:37.000]  of them are bigger than the GDPs of major nations, out of the top 100 GDPs, over 50
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.240]  – pull up the numbers, Forbes reports on it every year – over 50 are corporations,
[17:41.240 --> 17:42.880]  not countries.
[17:42.880 --> 17:48.880]  They have mercs, they have spies, they have sex operatives, they have hitmen.
[17:48.880 --> 17:52.520]  In most major cities, good old boys that run the town have hitmen.
[17:52.520 --> 17:55.240]  It isn't just Italian mafia.
[17:55.240 --> 17:58.560]  There's plenty of wealthy old families in Austin.
[17:58.560 --> 18:03.320]  I mean, LBJ had hitmen when he was in Congress, but I'm not going to get off into all that
[18:03.320 --> 18:04.320]  right now.
[18:04.320 --> 18:07.800]  The point is, is that this is how the real world works.
[18:07.800 --> 18:12.440]  And I told you there were going to be hitmen involved over a week ago, repeatedly.
[18:12.440 --> 18:17.200]  I said, they've got hitmen, and if this continues, there's going to be deaths.
[18:17.200 --> 18:19.600]  Well, what's in the Daily Mail?
[18:19.600 --> 18:21.600]  What is NBC?
[18:21.600 --> 18:28.480]  Someone's coming to get me terrified phone-hacking whistleblower feared for his life before he
[18:28.480 --> 18:30.840]  was found dead.
[18:30.840 --> 18:31.840]  That's right.
[18:31.840 --> 18:33.280]  And it goes on.
[18:33.280 --> 18:39.320]  The man who launched the entire phone-hacking scandal had become paranoid.
[18:39.320 --> 18:40.560]  Oh, so he's paranoid.
[18:40.560 --> 18:43.400]  It's like looking both ways at a four-way stop.
[18:43.400 --> 18:44.400]  That's not paranoia.
[18:44.400 --> 18:45.400]  That's common sense.
[18:45.400 --> 18:53.080]  A paranoid recluse who believes someone was out to get him a friend has revealed.
[18:53.080 --> 19:00.040]  Sean Whore, who was found dead in his flat in Watford yesterday, had spent much of the
[19:00.040 --> 19:05.480]  last week of his life hiding in his flat with the curtains drawn.
[19:05.480 --> 19:09.240]  Told folks they're coming to get me, just like Diana said.
[19:09.240 --> 19:13.320]  Prince Charles told me he's going to kill me in a fake auto accident.
[19:13.320 --> 19:15.560]  What way of Western intelligence to kill you?
[19:15.560 --> 19:19.920]  Well, they have the movie, Siriana, based on Bob Baer.
[19:19.920 --> 19:21.080]  He's telling the guy he wants you to kill him.
[19:21.080 --> 19:25.480]  He goes, I want you to drug him, put him in a car, and run a truck into it.
[19:25.480 --> 19:26.480]  That's true story.
[19:26.480 --> 19:32.520]  I want you to drug him, put him in a car, run a truck into him.
[19:32.520 --> 19:36.160]  She told the butler that she shot a video Scotland Yard confiscated, but they didn't
[19:36.160 --> 19:37.160]  get her diary.
[19:37.160 --> 19:38.160]  It's in her diary.
[19:38.160 --> 19:39.160]  What did Hutton say?
[19:39.160 --> 19:42.000]  What did the Hutton inquiries say about Dr. David Kelly?
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.240]  The head weapons inspector said it's all a lie about WMDs.
[19:45.240 --> 19:48.160]  He sent an email to friends and colleagues saying I've been told that he found dad in
[19:48.160 --> 19:49.160]  the woods.
[19:49.160 --> 19:50.160]  They murdered him.
[19:50.160 --> 19:52.600]  Dead in a hammer, found dad in the woods.
[19:52.600 --> 19:55.800]  Slit rest no blood at the scene.
[19:55.800 --> 19:56.800]  Come back with us.
[19:56.800 --> 19:58.400]  Now, who murdered this guy?
[19:58.400 --> 20:01.040]  We'll be right back.
[20:01.040 --> 20:05.360]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water

[21:38.680 --> 21:39.680]  to serve as debt.
[21:39.680 --> 21:43.200]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[21:43.200 --> 21:46.560]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[21:46.560 --> 21:50.840]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[22:00.520 --> 22:05.160]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[22:05.160 --> 22:09.480]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[22:09.480 --> 22:13.800]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[22:13.800 --> 22:15.120]  allows you to have.
[22:15.120 --> 22:20.840]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[22:20.840 --> 22:25.160]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[22:25.160 --> 22:29.160]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[22:29.160 --> 22:32.640]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[22:32.640 --> 22:36.360]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[22:36.360 --> 22:41.160]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[22:41.160 --> 22:44.880]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[22:44.880 --> 22:46.280]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[24:19.320 --> 24:29.120]  All those drifters' days are past me now, I've got so much more to think about.
[24:29.120 --> 24:38.120]  Deadlines and commitments, what to leave in, what to leave out.
[24:38.120 --> 24:44.120]  Against the wind, we were running against the wind.
[24:44.120 --> 24:52.520]  Okay, so this guy's now been dead since yesterday morning in England, and within 20 minutes
[24:52.520 --> 24:57.040]  of them announcing they found the dead body, the police walked out to the press court and
[24:57.040 --> 24:59.600]  said, we don't think there's any foul playing.
[24:59.600 --> 25:04.160]  Okay, a guy is telling his neighbors and everybody that they're out to get him, he's scared for
[25:04.160 --> 25:09.560]  his life, he's the person that blew the whistle and said, no, this goes directly to the head
[25:09.560 --> 25:18.560]  of News of the World who himself openly works for David Cameron, okay?
[25:18.560 --> 25:27.000]  Now he's dead and the police out of the gate say, we don't think that there's anything suspicious
[25:27.000 --> 25:28.280]  about this.
[25:28.280 --> 25:35.040]  How asinine is that, and of course the police, you have the police chief of London, incredibly
[25:35.040 --> 25:39.760]  powerful position, the commissioner resigning, you have the head of Scotland Yard resigning,
[25:39.760 --> 25:43.720]  one of the oldest law enforcement agencies in the world, you have all this going on and
[25:43.720 --> 25:48.200]  a guy at the center of it's dead and the police say nothing to see here move along.
[25:48.200 --> 25:54.120]  And there's articles out calling people conspiracy theorists today in the news if you think this
[25:54.120 --> 25:56.120]  is suspicious.
[25:56.120 --> 26:01.000]  There's news saying it's suspicious and that you're a conspiracy theorist if you think
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.800]  the big pharma heads girlfriend being found bound and gagged hanging from the front balcony
[26:06.800 --> 26:11.880]  four days after the sun fell down the stairs and died later, two people died a house in
[26:11.880 --> 26:18.360]  a week and the police say no foul play hanging from a rope bound and gagged and I've seen
[26:18.360 --> 26:25.400]  it in Austin as Palestinian activist professor gutted wrist slit bound with duct tape mouth
[26:25.400 --> 26:33.240]  hands legs thrown into the water into the Colorado River in downtown Austin and the
[26:33.240 --> 26:37.560]  police said oh yeah he bound himself and did all this through himself in that's who
[26:37.560 --> 26:44.920]  runs America that's who runs America we need to stop being little children this is who
[26:44.920 --> 26:52.920]  runs England stop being naive about government the man who launched the entire phone hacking
[26:52.920 --> 26:58.280]  scandal has become a paranoid recluse he was paranoid he's dead now he's a conspiracy
[26:58.280 --> 27:03.320]  theorist he's evil who believes someone was out to get him he's dead now but he's a friend
[27:03.320 --> 27:08.280]  has revealed Sean whore who was found dead at his flat in Watford yesterday had spent
[27:08.280 --> 27:13.680]  much of the last week of his life hiding in his flat with the curtains drawn last night
[27:13.680 --> 27:18.200]  a friend and neighbor claimed Matt whore 47 had become increasingly reclusive and paranoid
[27:18.200 --> 27:22.240]  in recent weeks he would talk about someone from the government coming to get him he'd
[27:22.240 --> 27:27.760]  say to me if anyone comes by don't say I'm in he was physically going downhill he was
[27:27.760 --> 27:32.200]  yellow in color and wasn't looking well for the last month he had a constant struggle
[27:32.200 --> 27:37.320]  with alcohol and talked to me about how much he had put his wife through he did say something
[27:37.320 --> 27:43.520]  about phone hacking and I think that was his main worry I know kidding he was had definite
[27:43.520 --> 27:48.280]  concerns with the media he did mention he was paranoid and would mention conspiracy stuff
[27:48.280 --> 27:55.000]  see conspiracy he's at the center of something that is very probably going to bring down the
[27:55.000 --> 28:02.400]  prime minister of the united kingdom the two head police chiefs in the country have had
[28:02.400 --> 28:08.200]  to resign they've arrested the head of news corps there's bribery scandals intelligence

[36:22.600 --> 36:30.000]  him but we believe it's normal to shoot yourself twice in the head it'd be hard enough to be

[36:35.480 --> 36:39.200]  trying to shoot yourself in the in the in the in the first the back of the head and then

[47:13.600 --> 47:19.040]  that the Hadron superconducting super collider showed evidence that it is solar particles
[47:19.040 --> 47:24.440]  that are the main driver of climate and so they've classified that information it's like
[47:24.440 --> 47:31.840]  two years ago the UN at the the United Nations at their Copenhagen global government taxing
[47:31.840 --> 47:40.920]  summit they came out and they said first thing we're going to have a vote and vote that the
[47:40.920 --> 47:46.080]  sun doesn't affect climate and that that was headlines the sun doesn't affect climate
[47:46.080 --> 47:50.160]  and Princess Diana wasn't murdered and Bill Clinton didn't lie about having sex with that
[47:50.160 --> 47:56.520]  woman you know and but Kepler elves are real I mean this is the magnitude because because
[47:56.520 --> 48:00.160]  they want to say that it's cows passing gas there's always been bovine running around
[48:00.160 --> 48:04.200]  the planet it's part of the atmosphere they want to say carbon dioxide we put off the
[48:04.200 --> 48:10.000]  plants then use and then put off oxygen the life cycle that that's evil so they can take
[48:10.000 --> 48:16.720]  over and decide who can have a business who can operate and who can they're all exempt
[48:16.720 --> 48:22.040]  and now it's come out in the age newspaper that oh they found what all the other scientists
[48:22.040 --> 48:26.240]  have found around the world it's the solar particles but other particles coming in from
[48:26.240 --> 48:33.680]  space this has been known for 20 years that are forming the nuclei that form clouds why
[48:33.680 --> 48:38.000]  do you think clouds always form meteorologists have always known this during the day they
[48:38.000 --> 48:44.000]  didn't quite understand it but the big driver is you're facing the sun that sucker is powerful
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.280]  it's cooking you know when the earth tilts away from the sun the side we're on we get
[48:48.280 --> 48:56.120]  winter it it it's we would be absolute zero within less than a day if the sun went out

[58:55.280 --> 59:00.400]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[59:00.400 --> 59:05.280]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[59:05.280 --> 59:10.880]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[59:10.880 --> 59:15.920]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[59:15.920 --> 59:21.040]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[59:21.040 --> 59:25.200]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[59:25.200 --> 59:29.920]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[59:29.920 --> 59:34.320]  insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:12.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:21.760]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:30.320]  all right let's go to joshua in florida got several guests coming up joshua you're on the air welcome
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:37.600]  mr jones how are you today sir good uh you know you alluded yesterday to another amazing uh
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.560]  suicide that took place actually today is the six-year anniversary of when uh product first class
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:48.880]  levina johnson beat herself up raped herself burned her genitals shot herself in the head and burnt
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:54.640]  the uh haliburton tent that her dead body was found in well so are you a conspiracy theorist
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:00.000]  i mean diana said charles told me he's gonna kill me in a fake auto accident on video in a diary and
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.880]  and it's proven they killed her and it was all staged now but so what and this other guy said
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.640]  that they were gonna kill him and after him he was the main whistleblower who could bring down
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:14.000]  rupert murdoch the prime minister he's found dead but they call it a conspiracy theory to even
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.240]  question the cops within minutes of finding uh the body saying it wasn't foul play uh you're supposed
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.720]  to just believe what you're told okay well i have to agree i think these people who question this are
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.200]  really like anti-american seditionists i think they should probably be executed with no trial
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.800]  because this is america we can't have people questioning the government this country was
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.600]  founded on bootlicking alex you know that well the land of the bootlickers home of the cowards
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:42.080]  uh and i mean look all over the country city councils are firing mayors they don't like outside
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:47.920]  of law banning free speech banning assembly banning and founding any group without their permission
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.960]  you can't have gardens that's happening all over the country i mean this is freedom pal
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.160]  and this is good this is great there's some local local tyranny going on here in Orlando i think
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:02.560]  you've covered it where the uh they have a city ordinance here to where you can't speed you can't
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:08.000]  speed up uh share food with homeless uh with greater groups of 25 or more within two miles of city
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.800]  hall and i've actually gone down there on several occasions to document this and i keep asking the
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.800]  police like is there any law you're going to force i've got police officers on record when i say
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.000]  you know if they say it's against the law to practice christianity will you arrest people
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.480]  yes we will if it's a law if it's against the law to own firearms we round people up if it's a
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:30.640]  law we'll do it so it's very alarming uh this this is in Orlando the the town i've seen a bunch of
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:35.440]  towns where they arrest you in mass you know i mean even if you hand a homeless person a sandwich
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.880]  they'll have like 20 cops there arresting preachers and people and really getting off on it yeah they
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.360]  actually had a sting they did a sting here where once they passed the ordinance they had cops dress
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.960]  up as homeless people and they did a head count and it was legal to feed 24 and 25 homeless people
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:56.240]  but they did a head count and as soon as that 26 uh sandwich was given to the homeless good they
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:00.720]  brought them in and started arresting people i mean i'll stop you right there i've seen that video
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.600]  this is good i mean you don't pack your kid a lunch in chicago you can't be actually said parents

[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:37.840]  safety until i moved to florida and i realized you're not safe until you have a bunch of guys
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:43.680]  with black ski masking badges running around with batman utility belts and uh fully automatic weapons
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.560]  don't have a street corner that's real safety well real safety is where the government openly
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:53.680]  runs the narcotics and the hit teams and and the government hands out the guns to the gangs that
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:59.360]  they control to kill the rival gangs and they get caught and nobody gets in trouble but there's

[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:30.160]  into eugenics and made the film mafa 21 black genocide the 21st century america i thought
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:34.080]  i'd tie it into some of these eugenics books that we've been researching here written by
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:42.720]  u n prize winners um nobel peace prize winners you name it all posing as quote liberals you
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:48.240]  need to understand what's going on and how it dovetails with this article today that is up on
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:54.880]  prison planet dot com and info wars dot com david beckham reignites hypocrisy over over population
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:00.800]  alarmist ultra rich elitist lecture middle class on having less children reduced living standards
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:06.560]  while living in opulence and procreating with gusto they on all these eugenicists on average
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:14.880]  have five children private trains jets you name it that is all coming up a gold is at one thousand
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:26.960]  sixteen hundred one dollars uh and five cents uh we also have silver well above forty dollars
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:31.520]  an ounce as the dollar continues and other currencies to be devalued that's coming up but
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:36.400]  i've got to cover this breaking a week ago i got calls at the office i'm going to be honest a lot
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:41.120]  of times i get these calls and in other towns under marshal law another town has checkpoints
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:45.680]  even during the day another town i've seen towns in illinois where they come into your house
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.800]  and it's been in newspapers but the newspapers write it you know like it's a good thing and
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:56.160]  you know the johnson's woke up to police code enforcers at six a.m standing above their bed
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.000]  checking to see if they had more than two toothbrushes three toothbrushes with results
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.840]  in a fine meaning more people secretly live there under code enforcement i mean i've seen this i mean
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:13.440]  this stuff goes on and americans bend over and take it so it gets even worse well you've seen
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.840]  court site where they say there's no free speech and arrest people during citizens communication
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.000]  for no reason and fire the mayor when he says it's wrong even though the city council can't
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:28.320]  arkansas town seeks to ban free speech formation of groups including bird watching second amendment
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:33.280]  any group they want you've got to get permission if you even want to form a group to run somebody
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.640]  against them for council this is directly out of north korea and i imagine federal court's a rule
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:45.040]  it's wonderful let's play part of this clip and go to our guest here it is an ordinance in a small
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.560]  arkansas town is getting national attention it's a story you saw first on fox 16 the ordinance
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:56.160]  forbids groups to meet without city council approval and although it's aimed at one citizen's group
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:04.000]  in particular it encompasses anyone mentioning city business in a conversation fox 16's kathleen
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.080]  johnson uh talked with an attorney about this and she joins us now live to tell us what this
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:15.440]  attorney had to say about it well it's interesting the gold the gold city council still believes
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.160]  that these ordinances actually carry some weight and there's a very good reason for them but when
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:25.760]  i spoke to the law school dean at ual r he said they would only bring embarrassment to the natural
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:33.600]  state i couldn't believe that it was real when i first read it disbelief is a common first reaction
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:40.240]  to ghoul's latest city ordinances well the truth is the city of ghoul doesn't have the authority
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:46.400]  to tell anyone that they have no right to petition them and no right to speak and no right to exist
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:51.920]  in their city but that is just what the ordinances do disbanding a citizen's group forbidding the
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.640]  mayor from meeting with people and stopping any groups from forming if members discuss the city
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:03.200]  without council approval so the fact is if it's aimed at this group it also extends to you talking
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:09.280]  to your mother or a church group for any other group that's enough that's enough you know i i
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.800]  shouldn't laugh you can watch the rest of the newscast at info wars dot com fox 16 and at least
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:21.200]  fox said this was wrong i saw newscast during the obama campaign in missouri illinois and other
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.680]  states we played them and i got clips of it and obama deception fall the republic where they said
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:29.680]  if you criticize obama the police are going to arrest you and they cut the district turning they
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.640]  said yes we will decide if something's truthful if you say he's not a christian we will arrest you
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:41.440]  well whether that's true or not is your right to say it the point is this is a power grab
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:46.240]  and you know cops can't stick their hands down your pants without a warrant but tsa says they can
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:13:00.400]  every hospital has to have radio radiology test before they can run x-rays but tsa says they're
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:08.160]  exempt they have no law they just say we have guns we rule i mean hitler didn't have the law behind
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:13.920]  him he just did it and it's time for folks to realize this country has political spiritual
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:20.160]  psychological economic cancer now i wanted to get into eugenics from the perspective of what's
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:27.120]  being done to black americans i've talked to n double acp people i have talked to quote liberal
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:33.280]  black activist and they say i don't want to discuss black abortion because it's a sacrament for them
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:40.080]  and i say so if cops beat up a black gangbanger uh that's a big freak out everybody weeps in
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:47.360]  wales and ashes their teeth but if 51 to 52 percent of blacks are never born in this country
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:55.280]  oh that's a wonderful great thing okay and you need to know the history of margaret sanger
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:00.240]  and the liberal movement they said will poses liberals in public letters so we can kill these
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:06.720]  weeds those are quotes get rid of these weeds now you need to expand on that and we're going to our
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:14.960]  guest here we have a whole article up on it today at prisonplanet.com but here it is beckham's a bad
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:22.880]  example for families that's the big football star soccer star and the very groups lecturing them saying
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.640]  there should be a log it's having more than two children they're the ones that have five children
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.200]  or more like ted turner so we'll be talking more about that this is a larger agenda it's what the
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:35.600]  bisphenol a and the plastics is about we have the government documents on that we're going to be going
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:42.800]  over all of it uh today uh but uh i take you now to mark crutcher i appreciate holding while i was
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:51.040]  ranting and uh he's a pro-life movement full-time well-known national spokesman uh ldi.org life
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:57.200]  dynamics.com and he's got a syndicated radio show he's on in dallas makes documentary films i'm not
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:04.400]  going to uh i'm not going to belabor his long bio but the point is um that if you don't like
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:08.480]  government-run healthcare they say you're a racist chris matthew says that and carlos watson
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.400]  nothing to do with it they play the race card the truth is at the end of the day if you hang out
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:18.160]  with real mainline establishment liberals they're really control freak nazis who will giggle and
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.960]  laugh at you and admit they hate black people i don't know if that's what matthews thinks personally
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:28.400]  or watson but the people i run into including some black folks think we need to kill blacks
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:33.920]  i mean i mean this is a sacrament uh and mr crusher do you agree with that analysis absolutely
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:41.200]  they see um abortion first off you have to back up a little bit these are genesis uh who most people
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:46.080]  think don't exist anymore but they actually do you know it's kind of like um from a spiritual
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:50.960]  standpoint i've always said that one of the greatest tricks that was ever played by satan
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.360]  is that he convinced people he doesn't exist that gives him free reign to do whatever he wants to do
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:01.280]  eugenicists are in the same situation these eugenicists have convinced people that eugenics
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:06.080]  is something that that died with the nazis when in reality it's more prevalent today than it's
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:13.760]  ever been and these people are what i call the money elite the uh ted turners the bill and melinda
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:19.680]  gates is the george soros warren buffett even in picking these people believe that the world
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:24.640]  belongs to them and that the rest of us are just kind of interlopers who they can decide
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:30.640]  to let's stay or not let's stay pro-wimfrey it's been in mainstream news that they quote meet secretly
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.840]  to discuss a quote global government to forcibly reduce population that's times of London we'll
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.640]  put that up absolutely they they believe that they have the right to sit down in a room somewhere
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:46.880]  there with their fellow travelers and decide not only which individuals get to live and die but
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:53.120]  which entire races of people are allowed to live and which ones will be forced to die and it is a
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:59.440]  frightening world that we live in because the american people have become anesthetized to all
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:04.160]  this stuff and they're more concerned about who's going to play in the super bowl next year than
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:09.760]  they are any of these kind of issues uh you know i could go on the streets downtown Dallas today or
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:14.800]  you could Alex we could stand there and talk about things that we have absolute irrefutable proof
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:21.680]  that are going on and 90 percent like these things and 90 percent of the things people that walk by
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.160]  would totally ignore us but we if we were standing there talking about the Dallas Cowboys or the
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.960]  Dallas Mavericks or you know the New York Yankees or something we'd have people lined up around
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:37.600]  the block wanting to talk and i think that these globalists these these eugenics people that the
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:42.880]  people who who see the world is their is their playground i think that to some degree they may
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:47.840]  have consciously created this situation in which they've anesthetized the public oh no they've
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:53.200]  written a bunch of books ever bernays uh i mean there's scores of books where they brag in the
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:58.400]  20s and 30s that they were setting up this system where people will love their servitude and and
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:02.880]  where they arrest the development of men and women where people are in a childlike state for all of
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:09.040]  life and giggle at anything serious absolutely that's where we are that's where we are is a
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:14.800]  country uh that's where the world is is is has actually we're following the rest of the world
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:20.000]  into over the abyss if you tell a lot of black people this who are bought into the system especially
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.520]  they'll say oh shut up you're making that up you're probably a racist i mean you're going 52
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:30.000]  percent of you were never born this is a plan they say that they want to kill you as weeds
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.720]  that they said they would pose as liberals and a lot of black folks are so wedded to worshiping
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:40.640]  obama they don't even want to listen to you well yeah but i'm telling you alex we're seeing since
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:46.560]  my office 21 came out we're seeing a groundswell of of not being the leaders that we're that you're
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:51.040]  talking about the people at the in the so-called leadership roles because remember something
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:56.000]  black leaders do not represent black people in america anymore than our so-called white
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  leaders represent white people in america there is this disconnect between the between the leaders
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:10.080]  and the people they're supposed to serve um and i what i'm seeing is that a lot of blacks are starting
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:14.400]  to wake up to this and say you know i've always been suspicious about some of these things this
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:19.520]  eugenics stuff and why all the Planned Parenthood facilities are in our neighborhoods and and uh
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.800]  they're starting to wake up to this and they're starting to see that many of their leaders just
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.400]  like we're seeing in the white community many of their leaders have sold them down the river
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:33.280]  mark crutches our guests we're going to come back from break and give him the floor to get into his
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:40.400]  film how eugenics was first tested out on black people the first ibm computer was to track blacks

[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:45.360]  film black genocide in the 21st century maafa or mafa uh m a a f a a documentary film mafa 21
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:50.240]  this is a short segment long segment coming up we'll get into more contemporary examples of this
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:55.920]  but tell folks about the film which by the way is available at info wars dot com if folks want
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:02.160]  to get the film wake folks up support your great ministry support our work the the film is available
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:08.080]  at info wars dot com for folks that want to get it but mark break down what the film covers well
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:13.600]  basically we start um we want to show people what the real origins of legalized abortion were
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:18.640]  uh the american people have been sold this idea that that abortion is about women's rights and
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:23.840]  privacy and reproductive freedom and choice and all this basically sells pitches that we hear all
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:31.200]  the time the reality is that the legalization of abortion was just the the latest tool and a string
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:36.880]  of eugenics tools that were used to wipe out the african-american race in america and it
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:44.240]  i know this sounds strange but i think we do a good job of connecting the dots from the days
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:51.040]  before the end of slavery right up to the day we started with that premise that that we would go
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:56.240]  backwards from legalized abortion what was the motive behind it what drove it and where we ended
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:01.360]  up going backwards was in the days but that's not strange that's where the first gun control in this
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:06.560]  country came from was after emancipation proclamation they said we can't have blacks having guns
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:12.160]  that's right and you know in testing i went to a showing them off at 21 in arizona uh when i was
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:18.080]  after given a speech not too long ago and a black gentleman came up to me afterward and he said i had
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.080]  to come see this he said because it reinforces a lot of things i'd heard about it and he said it
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:26.160]  reinforces a lot of things that i'd always thought he said now my particular issue is second
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:31.440]  amendment and he said did you know that the original gun control laws in this country were were
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:37.440]  enacted to keep blacks from getting done and i said well i had heard that i said i haven't
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:41.600]  studied i can't say that i that i'm an expert in that field he said well i am and i can tell you
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:48.880]  absolutely that is the origin of of gun control laws in america and he said so this idea of that
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:53.760]  the origin of abortion and the origin of eugenics started with the effort to wipe out the black
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:59.280]  community is is not strange at all to me he said it's not even remotely far-fetched it makes perfect
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:04.800]  sense thing he said the things that i saw in this film tie up a lot of loose ends for me and explain
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:11.760]  a lot of things that i never understood well that's exactly what's going on and up until even the
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:17.360]  80s there was still secret forced sterilization going on and you know whatever's tested the black
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:23.440]  community has then moved out you know against everybody and my research has gotten into the
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:29.200]  rockerfeller foundation now with uh hormones added to vaccines we have the total proof of that
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:36.720]  bisphenol aid to reduce fertility they are going after everybody in this system yeah and and you
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:43.280]  know we we have a segment in the mouth of 21 and about the the link between the american eugenics
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:50.800]  movement and the nazi and basically the the nazi eugenics program originated with the united states
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:56.320]  i mean uh madison grant who is who is one of the head of leaders of the american eugenics
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:03.680]  society wrote a book with that adolf hitler called his bible and it was about creating
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:07.760]  basically the master race and adolf hitler referred to madison grant's book as his bible and he
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:15.920]  repeatedly said that his heroes and the people that he looked to for guidance um for his eugenics
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:22.720]  programs in and nazi germany were all american and a few british but mostly american um we also
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:28.960]  have to understand that keiser willhelm is to in in europe in germany that was the place where all
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:35.840]  the eugenics models were designed for nazi germany or for nazi occupied europe um was actually funded
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:41.280]  by the rockerfeller foundation and the carneke foundation so all this all these links between
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:47.280]  the nazis and the and the american eugenics movement um most people have no idea that this
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:52.880]  that this was going on but in reality it was we were not we were not clean in this situation i can
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:59.680]  assure you well it's so important to get this film out to everybody uh because it gets even more
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:05.120]  sophisticated uh if you look at the model and we've got all the documents we've published and
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:09.440]  we've covered them in previous shows i've got erin popping in later that was this a little bit
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:15.680]  marked to go over some of this but you go back to the 20s and 30s as you know they said we've
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:19.360]  got to have the state break up the family we're going to start with blacks we're going to pay the
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:24.320]  women not to have a man in the house then we can institutionalize their males like they've done
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:30.160]  native american males and we can then totally destroy these people then they put the blacks
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:37.280]  in the prisons they turn into gang bangers uh then the society totally degenerates they come out
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:43.120]  and push music and messages that destroy the black family now that model is used against everyone
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:47.440]  we'll talk about that when we come back this is how they destroy a group of people and they're
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:52.960]  doing it to all of us by the way folks we'll be right back stay with us we're on the march the
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:30:03.840]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network when you're out on the road the last

[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:07.200]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation

[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:28.480]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:33.840]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:38.400]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:49.280]  dykes popping in uh here in just a moment uh but but why do i go back over eugenics so much why
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:55.600]  do i talk about it even though we've got all of this news and all of this information in front
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:01.200]  of us why do i spend almost every day at least 30 minutes on this because ladies and gentlemen
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:06.160]  and we got air and popping in a moment we have read it's got to be conservatively over 100 books
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:12.480]  written by them and these are the heads of the un the heads of unesco you know the imf chiefs the
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:18.240]  british royalty the dutch royalty uh the mainstream news articles about how they have secret meetings
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:25.120]  and it's about population reduction this is what they're obsessed with this is what governs what
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:30.000]  they're doing this is why they're coming out with vaccines that sterilize you whether you like it or
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.600]  not this is why they're putting things in the gmo crops that are engineered in every major study to
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:41.920]  sterilize rodents having the same effect on humans cancer doubling the last decade diabetes
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:48.080]  doubling this is a big deal this is a lot more important than dancing with the stars and uh going
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:54.880]  back to our guest i mean look at this news uh that i've got uh here today beckham's a bad example
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:00.080]  for families where the fourth child the couple have joined the ranks of the irresponsible population
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:06.720]  experts say uh and then meanwhile ted turner has five kids all these big houses al gore's got all
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:13.040]  you know this giant carbon footprint the british royal family their own trains jets yachts uh the
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:18.640]  the roth child's pushing this these folks just want the earth to themselves what's your view and take
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:24.960]  on that and how they're attacking the family well we had a story that we covered on life talk here a
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:32.560]  couple months ago in england where uh there's this group of people that are that are advocating that
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:38.400]  people are saying that people who have children are irresponsible and may be criminal because of the
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:45.200]  carbon footprint that every child creates on the earth and they're actually saying that people who
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:51.360]  if you if you slip up and end up pregnant that the only responsible thing to do is have an abortion
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:59.120]  and it is you're right about one thing the hypocrisy of this is breathtaking because you
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:03.760]  have these these hypocrites like like al gore coming up here out here talking about the carbon
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:10.720]  footprint while he has a personal carbon footprint that's as much as some small town and yet no one
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:16.240]  calls him to task for that and it goes back to what i said earlier these people these what i call
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:21.760]  the money to lead in this world they consider the earth their playground and the rest of us are just
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:29.440]  allowed here as we provide services and we're kind of the servile class and whatever we can do to
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:36.800]  support them is fine and we're and we're tolerated to that extent but beyond that uh like i said this
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:42.320]  is there this earth belongs to them and they are the god of this earth well mark crutcher i
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:48.080]  have gotten the textbooks going back over 100 years i've shown them on air we've we've made
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:53.200]  special reports you know with the material where they openly said we're going to destroy the family
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:57.040]  we're going to put folks on welfare so they're dependent through education we're going to lower
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:02.480]  the test scores and make people regurgitate information instead of actually having critical
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:06.800]  thinking i've interviewed the former head of policy department of education in the 80s where
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:12.960]  this was admittedly uh the goal uh the you know the lower down people didn't know and they talk
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:19.920]  in these documents about the family being an anachronism uh archaic that needs to be eradicated
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:26.560]  and again we see the model being blacks what 50 years ago they had less than 50 illegitimacy
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:31.760]  and then and i'm not bashing single parents folks but the point is that you have three times a
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:37.200]  chance of being in prison or even higher when that happens and with blacks it's gone from
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:45.360]  below 50 to over 90 percent now and and and the system just completely brainwashes and
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:53.440]  sells a culture of total criminality to black people yeah and they basically have set blacks up
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:38:00.880]  for failure um they have created an environment in which they and i agree with something you said
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:07.440]  earlier white liberals in this country hate blacks contrary to what they're going to tell you out in
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:15.760]  public they hate the black race and i think that they have set up a situation that was
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:22.560]  specifically decided uh as a way to get rid of blacks and you know i'll say another group that
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:28.160]  has been uh victimized by this a few years ago i went to uh do a speech in south dakota
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:34.720]  and we were driving between pier south dakota and rapid city south dakota and i saw a sign for a
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:40.000]  indian reservation and i and i had never even though i'm right here in north texas and you
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.120]  know there's indian reservations not far from here i'd never been on one i thought well i'm
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:47.280]  gonna go what does this look like and so we've got off the road and we have some extra time it
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.520]  drove down this this little two-lane black top road and finally came to this indian reservation
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:58.640]  which is basically just a small little town it was the saddest thing that i have ever seen in my life
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:03.440]  um and it is that if you go to one of these indian reservations and you see the level of
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:10.960]  alcoholism and the level of the poverty and all the other social cultural problems that
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:18.320]  existed on these reservations what you're looking at is the is the design of white liberals
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:26.320]  and what white liberals have done to the american indian the native american it's far more criminal
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:32.480]  than anything that was done to them prior to the to the modern times and i think that that's the
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:37.920]  model that they're that they're using in the african-american race and now they're really
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:44.640]  branching out to go after hispanics as hispanics have now become the second most uh the second
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:50.880]  most populous race in america and mark let me stop you there in my film in game blueprint for global
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:58.160]  enslavement that is an excellent complementary film to mafa 21 black genocide in the 21st century
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:05.920]  we have a clip from a texas legislative meeting with the head of the state of texas psychiatry
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:11.360]  board being questioned by representatives and they say why are 68 percent of foster children
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:19.440]  on an average of seven psychotropic drugs and he says they have bad gene pools and that's what
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:26.400]  cps says when they come take poor white children black children hispanic statistically to uh
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:31.920]  situations five times more dangerous than home but with no oversight over government
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:39.040]  and he went on to say that they basically are defective humans eugenics is their operating mode
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:44.960]  and if you talk to a quote white liberal and say we need to stop aborting all these black people
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.920]  they say are you going to adopt these blacks when statistics show there are folks that want to
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:54.320]  adopt the blacks in fact more people want to adopt than there are even blacks being killed
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:41:00.880]  then they have black liberal groups come out and block whites or hispanics adopting blacks
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:07.520]  and that's being foundation funded by the eugenicists they want those blacks dead so it is racism
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:12.720]  to want to save black babies and god forbid raise them with whites because then that would
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:19.280]  unify people instead of folks being against each other this is so diabolical well let me tell you
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:25.840]  i as we were doing my offer 21 and and as you know and doing something like this a lot of times
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:31.280]  some of the best stuff winds up on the cutting room floor um and i can tell you that one of you
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:38.000]  start picking up on on trends and and attitudes and things and it became crystal clear to me
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.720]  that since the beginning of this eugenics movement that started like i said right before the end of
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:52.800]  of slavery in america um this money elite in the world has consciously tried to keep black people
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:57.760]  and white people and hispanic people fighting with each other because as long as we were fighting
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:01.440]  with each other we weren't seeing what the government was doing and what the money the
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:06.880]  league were doing and they had a vested interest in keeping us all at each other's throat and i
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:14.480]  think the the the hope for all of this is that is when whites and blacks and hispanics start
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:20.400]  talking to each other and saying you know wait a minute something's not right here i i wasn't
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:25.920]  born hating you where did this all come from and i'm telling you i don't know how much
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:30.800]  studying you've done on the on the third rite but one of the one of the tricks that hitler used
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:36.960]  was to keep all his top people fighting with each other because hitler was scared to death
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.440]  that if these people don't hate each other they'll eventually join forces and come after me
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.400]  now he would play them off against each other absolutely he kept he kept everybody he made
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:51.120]  sure everybody there hated everybody else and didn't trust them and in a in a sense that's
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:56.480]  what the money to lead in this world has been doing for the last 150 years they've been trying to
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:01.680]  make sure that black people and white people and now hispanic people don't trust each other hate
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:07.840]  each other and don't speak to each other and and well that's called divide and conquer absolutely
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:11.920]  and then the and then all the leadership of the groups that represent the white groups the black
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:16.240]  groups the hispanic groups the asian groups you track them back to the very same Rockefeller
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:22.320]  carnegie billa melinda gates foundations where the leaders are funded by them and so they will then
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:28.160]  do whatever the leaders say even though they're eugenicist operatives that's why a liberal black
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:34.400]  person will defend and so will the white more than half of blacks never being born because
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:41.120]  that's now a liberal sacrament and you are a racist for not wanting black people dead that that is
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:48.480]  the nutshell and of course it makes no sense but but they know through tribalism through divide
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:53.440]  and conquer that's exactly what's going on uh mark i want to bring erin dykes in here one
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:58.000]  of our great researchers at info wars dot com in a moment but what are some of the other facets
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:03.680]  of mafa 21 that that people need to understand and why is it important this film be shown well
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:09.520]  first off i think one of the most and you know alex i've always thought when you do a project
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:13.280]  like this when you're doing research if you don't learn as much as you eventually teach
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:18.720]  then it was a failure and i can tell you that i learned things in in doing the in doing mafa 21
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:23.200]  that i never knew before i've been in the pro-life movement for 30 years and and there were things
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:28.640]  about it that i didn't know that i found out one of those was that the original groups in america
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:34.240]  who were opposed to abortion were not the catholic church or any of the pro-life groups that that
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:39.920]  we all know so well today it was actually the black panthers the nation of islam it was the
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:46.640]  radical 60 civil rights groups who saw this was before abortion was legalized but they saw that
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:51.600]  that white liberals pushing for the legalization of abortion was an instrument that was going to be
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:59.520]  used to wipe out the black race they saw that clearly and we need to understand this is part
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:05.840]  of this thing of keeping us all divided because when you start looking at say some of these 60s
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:13.040]  the radical 60 civil rights groups you think well the the emphasis of that is white conservatives
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:19.520]  when in reality we have a lot more in common than you might think and when you sit and talk with
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:23.680]  some of these guys and i had a very unique experience here one day with a guy just literally
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:29.600]  walked up and knocked on our door and wanted to come in and talk and he's in his 60s now
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:36.320]  he was one of the founders of the black panther party in north texas and he had seen my offer 21
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.320]  and saw that it was made here in dentin so he he lives here in dentin and he came over to talk
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:44.720]  one of the most interesting conversations i've ever had in my life we talked for probably
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:52.080]  two and a half three hours and it was amazing to me to hear how many things that he talked about
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:58.080]  in the civil rights movement in the 60s were so similar to the pro-life and pro-family movement
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:03.360]  that we have today and how some of the the things that we had to fight against that we had to fight
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:08.160]  against today they had to fight against back in the 60s it was the exact same phenomenon
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:11.920]  and they were treated the same way by the by the government they were treated the same way by the
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:17.600]  media the the perception i had this discussion with someone in the pro-life movement all on go
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:24.240]  so and i said he said well all these 60 civil rights groups uh were xxx and he you know had
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:29.600]  these preconceived ideas about it i said where did you get that information i said who who who
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.680]  gave you that particular view of these groups he said well it's just what i read and heard i said
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:38.640]  so the media gave it to you and he said well yeah i guess so and i said what do you think the
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:44.080]  perception is among people today in america of the of the pro-life movement and where do you
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:49.360]  think they got that perception the media gave it to them well let me expand they also promote
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:55.680]  counterfeits just like true constitutionalists founded the tea party in support of ron paul
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:47:01.600]  four years ago the republican party two years ago openly came in co-opted the name and tried to take
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:08.080]  it over it's the same thing they do this every time absolutely and so and i told this this
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:14.800]  friend of mine not long ago i said look if you don't if you don't want to accept the media's portrayal
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:20.800]  of you as a pro-lifer then don't just automatically accept the media's portrayal of this man here in
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:27.760]  dentin because he forms the black panthers here in in north texas and the perception that you have
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:32.240]  of him came from the same people who you now say are liars about the pro-life movement it's the same
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:37.920]  group of people also they take unstable people from all these groups and then give them attention
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:42.960]  and just like a lot of black leaders that are radical turn out to be closet feds most white
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:48.240]  supremacists like how turner and others turn out to be feds it's all part of their divide and
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:53.280]  conquer strategy that's why i have the adl southern poverty law center attacking me on one end and
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:57.680]  then the nazis attacking me on the other because that's all the same crew and that's come out over
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:02.080]  and over again i want to bring erin dykes in one of our researchers we've got a shot here of the
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:08.320]  of the molecular vision of life we've got all these eugenics publications put out by the eugenics
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:13.840]  group we have the former head of unesco a book about evolutionary studies about all this uh
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:19.600]  huxley's brother julian huxley where they admit eugenics is their religion erin chiming in on
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:25.200]  this discussion uh you know researching this uh i mean is eugenics not the heart of the of the new
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:31.200]  world order's uh religion it is absolutely at the heart of that and i think it's tied directly in
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:38.560]  with their quest for centralization for a world state uh and i think that really ties in with the
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:43.840]  value of labor uh in terms of i think what's really interesting in mafa 21 i haven't seen it
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:48.400]  in about over a year so i hope i'm not misquoting but he talks about how they were happy to have
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:52.720]  population grow under slavery with the black community uh because they could use them to
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:58.000]  work in the fields etc etc etc but once slavery was ended they had an incentive to decrease the
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:04.160]  population thus the era of uh proper eugenics and now the globalist in all their publications
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:07.840]  you've got some of those i want to impart this information to our guests because he's influential
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:13.760]  mark crutcher now they write because of robotics and industrialization they don't need any of us
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:17.120]  and that's why they have the headlines why the future doesn't need us well that's the other
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:21.200]  thing about slavery at the same time that was happening was the culmination of the industrial
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:26.240]  the cotton gin all of it and the industrial revolution ended in the monopolies that we see
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:31.760]  today amongst the rockefellers the carnaggies the forge etc etc and those people have been looking
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:37.920]  to further centralize us and yeah the rise of technology has further devalued the price of
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:45.120]  human labor the value of it to the point where they talk about openly killing us or using propaganda
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:50.160]  or psychological or biological techniques or all the above reading from their their plans and
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:55.440]  expanding on that is the birth rate or they'll keep us as pets as kindhearted liberals just as
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:58.880]  george brown and by the way you have the actual quotes from there you're reading from bill joy
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:03.520]  the owner of some microsystems there yeah he's quoting ted kazinski who was talking about the
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:08.880]  new luddite challenge uh the luddites you know revolted against the industrial revolution
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:14.320]  devaluing human labor uh whether they're right or wrong now we face a new challenge with technology
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:19.680]  as they've continued to centralize society to take over entire countries entire regions
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:24.800]  steer them in control and that's what environmentalism is about not the earth it's about teaching you
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:30.640]  you're bad you're worthless to take on this group guilt so you will then allow them to bring in a
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:35.360]  post industrial world and eventually euthanize you we're going to come back with our guests

[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:30.400]  is being promoted in england and europe and they have your children in the public schools

[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:56.720]  that gives you the full spectrum of what's going on but a lot of folks will say ah so what there
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:01.840]  are too many people remember you're being targeted as well idiots for those of you out there that
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:05.840]  giggle and laugh about this and kind of fantasize that you're part of the ruling elite because you
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:10.480]  buy into this uh erin uh i want mark to comment on some of your research but get into some of
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:14.480]  the other quotes i mean when they say it's a religion that's in the book put out by the eugenics
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:20.640]  society worshiping uh the founder of transhumanism who said he changed the name to transhumanism
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:26.640]  because eugenics was unpopular after hitler yeah that's true and uh we're talking about julian
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:31.440]  huxley the brother of altus huxley who was the first head of unesco part of the united
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:36.800]  nation's steering group to centralize everything and take control of the entire life process that's
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:42.640]  really what it comes down to and he talks about uh first they quote a dean ingie who says eugenics
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:48.880]  is capable of becoming the most sacred ideal of the human race as a race one of the supreme
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:56.320]  religious duties and then julian huxley says in his 1936 gallatin lecture i agree entirely with him
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:02.080]  once the full implications of evolutionary biology or graphs eugenics will inevitably become
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:07.280]  part of the religion of the future or whatever complex of sentiments may in the future take the
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:13.600]  place of religion and they admit that they can change any genetics they want i mean these are
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:19.280]  the people destroying the environment with gmo mosquitoes released fish with dozens of other
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:23.840]  animals in them all sorts of genetic scourge is already happening and they talk about well it's
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.800]  like ray Kurzweil he says i don't believe in god yet i'm going to be god these people and by the way
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:34.800]  the the the the wedgewoods the galtons the huxleys the uh darwins all intermarried and believed in
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:40.400]  the 1860s it would make supermen within two generations hardly any of the we we covered the
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:45.680]  numbers in endgame almost all of them died or were completely retarded and so the ones that
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:52.880]  lived i mean you look at the huxleys and folks they were crazy mad hatters just like royalty from
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:59.440]  egypt on interbreeding your comments on uh that mark crusher well yeah and you know you mentioned
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:05.200]  golfin francis golfin is is now considered to be the father of modern eugenics he's the guy who
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:10.960]  actually coined the word eugenics that that word did not exist before francis golfin made it up and
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.440]  what a lot of people don't know about francis golfin was that he was charles darwin's first cousin
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:26.800]  and you're talking about people who were avowed races darwin and golfin both wrote that africans
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:35.360]  in blacks and and uh aborigines which we didn't have aborigines in united states but that they were
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:39.680]  basically indistinguishable from the highest form of primate which they said was the gorilla
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:46.000]  and if you read darwin and golfin writings what they said was that the way to make the human race
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:53.760]  better was to get rid of the speak of the humans that were closest to the eighth well sir just two
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:58.320]  years ago the head of the ibm human genome bio weapon program you know it was a human genome
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:03.840]  project had to resign when he said blacks weren't human uh and i mean the point is though and they're
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:06.960]  not just for people that are racist out there they're not just targeting black folks they're
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:10.880]  targeting because they're not just saying they want to kill people they see as inferior they also
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:16.000]  want to kill the bad sons uh northern europeans that aren't under their control have you run into
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:22.960]  that research uh mr crutcher no i haven't but we we concentrated on on the area uh involving
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:28.560]  african americans because i think that what they did with african americans is they wanted to to
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:34.560]  prove a a philosophical point and then once you make the philosophical point that you can make
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:40.000]  the human race better by getting rid of one particular group once you stay there stay there

[02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:29.520]  all right into our number three got a ton of news coming up after this break i appreciate
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:36.560]  mark crutcher joining us this is only a five-minute segment erin's got information to the stars
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:41.600]  about this stuff where they call the populations they're going after targets how they say we
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:45.440]  got to get government health care in place so then we can force people to have sterilization
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:49.360]  and abortion for access to health care that's what government health care is about the nazis
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:55.280]  had that and all the same systems are being brought back but it's liberal and trendy uh mark
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:59.200]  crutcher you were trying to make a point before we hit that break yeah what i'm saying is that
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:07.920]  i think that the genesis uh in the 1850s 1860s decided that blacks could basically be a test case
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:14.320]  if they wanted to get rid of them of course but um they had made their fortunes on the backs of
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:18.080]  these slaves and now they thought they saw them as a potential financial drain so they wanted to
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:24.240]  get rid of them but from a from a practical standpoint i mean a pragmatic standpoint i think
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:28.160]  they saw them as a test case and they're saying look if we can make the human race better by
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:33.600]  getting rid of these blacks then once we've got the american people of the other people of the
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:39.120]  world to accept this philosophy then there's no reason that it has to stop it just blacks it could be
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:45.760]  hispanics it could be poor whites it could be italians it could be you know asians it could
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:49.920]  be chinese it could be david beckham because if david beckham and victoria beckham can't
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:55.520]  have children well you can't either absolutely and so that's why it was so important to them
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:02:00.960]  to establish this principle and the and the main target that they selected initially was the african
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:09.440]  american uh i want to get erin in here to to uh add to that erin uh the only place i disagree is
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:14.320]  that they started doing that worldwide starting in the early fifties the population council was
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:21.120]  then founded by john d rockefeller the third uh who started these programs all around the world
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:24.640]  in nearly every third world country that's our rand corporation report your little hand there
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:28.880]  this is a rand analysis of that the origins and evolution of family planning programs and
[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:35.040]  developing countries so you got the rockefeller population council mixed with unesco and i've
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:39.360]  read the documents there too where they analyze the countries the type of government if they're
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:44.480]  centralized enough they go for an authoritarian approach to birth control and quote family planning
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:48.720]  chinese style you know yeah chinese style forced abortion well you got julian huxley saying it's
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:53.680]  a global government religion and he's the founder of unesco yeah and they were only a few hundred
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:58.720]  scumbags and they talk about how to plant the messages and media radio television films they
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:03.200]  spend billions and everything i mean that's why an average woman sterilized by bisphenol a
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:07.840]  all screwed up breast cancer you name it will defend the system and say there's too many people
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:12.160]  as they're murdering her they feel like they're part of the establishment mark do you run into
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:17.120]  that a lot where the people uh who who defend this you know uh you'll think it's really cool
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:23.840]  i find it means more avaricious than that and a classic example of this is jesse jackson
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:31.440]  in the 1960s jesse jackson was one of the people who was most outspoken against legalized abortion
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:38.000]  in the spread of birth control clinics in in uh minority neighborhood and he was i mean i've
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.800]  got quote after quote we've got a few of them in my office 21 but we have found just dozens of
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:46.720]  things that he wrote in which he talked about this very issue that they're going to use birth
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:51.120]  control and abortion to wipe us out but the moment he decided that he wanted to run for
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:57.120]  president united states and he saw that the democratic party was was under the thumb of these
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:04.240]  of these eugenics people um he switched his his tune i mean literally this man went from
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:10.480]  one day saying literally that abortion and legalization of abortion and birth and the
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:16.720]  spread of birth control is specifically designed to wipe out the black race to a few days later
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:21.120]  saying the greatest civil rights issue of our time is the woman's right to choose and the only
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:26.320]  thing that changed was he decided he wanted to be president and he needed the money that these
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:31.360]  eugenics would bring to the table and then they wrecked the black communities with social engineering
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:36.560]  and say see we need to get rid of these people uh and and and then they set the paradigm for now
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:42.400]  we gotta get rid of everybody because everybody's an evil carbon polluter as bill gates has said
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:48.160]  so they're moving on now to the general population mark crutcher the film motha 21 available at

[02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:33.280]  identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:38.560]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner bernanke the arsonists they're asking
[02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:43.360]  for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:50.720]  does care and right now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of full
[02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:57.600]  of the republic on dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality

[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:24.960]  okay steven michael johnny john we're gonna get to all your calls the toll free number to join us
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:32.720]  is 800 25 at 9 92 31 towns all over the united states are announcing there's no free speech no right
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:37.840]  to assembly anywhere period without government permission uh that you can't pack your children
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:42.800]  school lunches in chicago you can't have gardens uh then this has happened in every other case in
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:49.760]  history humans act the same it's here we were covering uh the arkansas town of guld arkansas
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:56.720]  town seeks to ban free speech formation of groups that's fox 16 also in baltimore and they're trying
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:03.520]  to move for a one dollar per bullet tax on uh bullets they've got more of the same old lies
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:11.040]  about polar bear cubs die as ice melts swims get longer five out of 11 moms that swim long
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:15.920]  distances lost cubs study finds and when i saw this today i went and looked up the old studies
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:21.360]  as i've studied polar bears this is part of survival of the fittest this is what's always
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:26.000]  happened in the hundred plus years they've been studied so they've moved to a more sophisticated
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.800]  model five years ago they'd say polar bears cannot swim look at them on that iceberg they're
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:37.120]  going to die not telling you hey they're hunting beluga whale or walrus out there and they sometimes
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:48.560]  swim up to 300 miles uh in fact uh jaren was telling me that the last page has a wikipedia
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:55.680]  stat stapled on it oh right here that says the polar bear is an excellent swimmer an individual
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:03.360]  so have been seen the optin arctic as far as 200 miles i've seen 300 from land with its body fat
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:10.480]  providing buoyancy it swims in a dog paddle fashion using its large fore pause for propulsion
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:17.280]  it says polar bears can swim six miles per hour when walking the polar bear tends to have a lumbering
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:22.320]  gate maintains an average speed of 3.5 miles while sprinting they can reach 25 miles an hour
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:27.600]  the point is you can go research this polar bears can swim they're the best land swimming animal
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:35.520]  and uh cubs always die in fact that's why they have two usually one dies uh it's the same with
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:44.640]  many other species lion cubs tiger cubs a lot of them end up dying uh and it's with humans previously
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:51.600]  you know because with eugenics there's always veins of truth to it on average throughout
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:59.040]  history around 40 of human babies die by age five that's always been the way it is and so yes uh
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:05.600]  because of modern medicine weaker individuals are tend to survive and there are some statistical
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:11.200]  analysis that's showing that that's part of the slovenliness part of the weakness that we see in
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:16.320]  the public but also in the elites you think you think we're decadent look how decadent they've gotten
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:23.360]  and so uh you know it's it's literally the pot calling the kettle black here i mean look at the
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:30.320]  globalists they are an ugly ugly ugly group of people across the board uh because the elites
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:34.400]  always try to intermarry to keep their wealth and power together and so you get a lot of mental
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:40.240]  illness a lot of psychopathic behavior throughout every elitist culture because of this inbreeding
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:48.320]  okay i digress now um i've got all of this news to get to and i want to go to your phone calls
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:54.640]  and i'm going to go to your phone calls i'm gonna i will go to your phone calls and i also uh have
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:12:02.640]  this other news cern gags physicist in cosmic ray climate experiment what do these results
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:08.640]  mean not allowed to tell you well we already have hundreds and hundreds of other studies that that
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:14.000]  the cosmic rays are what drive climate particularly from the sun and they've all they've known this
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.280]  for at least 20 years and they don't want that information out i'm gonna be getting into that
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:24.240]  also of course 15 000 us troops will remain in iraq they will be renamed diplomats and the new
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:30.000]  war in libya is called a peace action and kinetic action and uh we've also got the reports in this
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:35.680]  article by paul watson where a lot of key sources are saying war is on between israel and iran
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:39.360]  in september doesn't mean that's going to happen but that's what these sources are saying we're
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:43.600]  going to report on what they say and i promise i'll get to doland and everybody else that's
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:49.280]  holding here in a moment but i wanted to bring ted anerson up to give us a golden silver update
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:54.000]  and invite people to get involved in something 11 years ago i sleep really good at night i told
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:00.320]  you get gold at 300 something bucks an ounce and those you get silver at five dollars an ounce and
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:06.800]  silver is above 40 today gold above 16 101 dollars uh and this is in the dead time of the year of the
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:10.880]  summer and it's all happening because they've announced they're going to further devalue the
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:17.120]  dollar and the euro and uh the markets of course are going wild and the economic numbers are coming
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:21.280]  in i want to go over some of those it does not look good because this is the wages of globalism
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:27.520]  but ted what's the latest on golden silver right now well presently gold hit a high today of 16 05
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:34.720]  80 silver hit a high today of 40 57 presently right now gold is at 15 88 20 silver's at 39
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:42.080]  39 39 right on the nose um just a real again a very active market usually you don't see this kind
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:49.520]  of thing happening in july um even bloomberg i mean today is reporting it just says gold may rise
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:56.320]  extended longest advance since 1975 sovereign debt crises i mean they're meeting in brussels and what i
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:14:00.880]  mean by that is the european government leaders and i don't know why they say it that way because
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:05.360]  it's the bankers that are meeting in brussels and the european government leaders are just puppets
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:09.840]  going with whatever they say but they're they're trying to figure out how to break the deadlock
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:16.480]  over this greek rescue and we have a 14.3 uh trillion dollar debt that here in the united
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:22.000]  states that they're arguing arguing whether or not they're going to raise the debt limit and if they
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.200]  do that just means this country's going further down the hill you know and that will extend the
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:33.600]  debt so we can pay our current bond i guess the bonds that are coming do uh you know the whole
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:38.560]  thing doesn't make sense that's why there's so much of a rush to save haven buying that's what i'm
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:44.560]  looking at all over the world copper thieves uh are stealing everything even nailed down in
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:49.360]  los angeles when i was there last weekend they were reporting that every day the bolted down
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:51.360]  steel uh
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:59.520]  mailboxes public mailboxes are being stolen a copper thief in south carolina snuck into
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:06.000]  an energy facility and was electrocuted trying to steal copper wire crime is exploding everywhere
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:11.280]  and i've got news reports where they're laying off police nationwide but raising taxes where's
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:16.160]  the money going it's going to the derivative debt that we were induced to sign on to that's
[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:23.680]  not our debt and is impossible to pay back so i just hope that people get involved in gold and silver
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:30.400]  today uh ted people are insane if they don't get involved in silver and gold because the laws
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:36.320]  of economic show that silver and gold are only going to go up as long as they devalue the currency
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:40.320]  and they've signified that they're going to continue to accelerate the devaluation of the
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:45.280]  dollar and the chinese came out months ago ron paul's pointed out as well we've been technically
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:51.760]  defaulted for three years and now they're monetizing the debt this means weimar republic this means
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:57.440]  zimbabwe and there's no way to turn it around it's been designed to bring us into bankruptcy
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:04.640]  sure has and and a great example of that is in 1964 a dime was made out of silver it was a
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:11.120]  constitutional mandate that dimes are made out of silver in 1965 they went to the uh copper nickel
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:17.600]  plated dime it now takes 30 of the copper nickel plated dimes to buy one of the other dimes it used
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:23.360]  to be one for one that's what's going on in the marketplace i alex you've made it incredibly easy
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:29.840]  to get involved with silver with the um uh the american dream video and uh mark dice's book you
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:35.040]  know two silver dollars 80 bucks delivered you're going to get the video you're going to get mark
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:38.960]  dice's book you're going to get two silver dollars like you said you sleep well at night
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:42.720]  because you've been recommending gold and silver well let me tell you the people that have been
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:48.000]  buying gold and silver for the last 10 20 years are really sleeping well at night because they have
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:53.840]  something that is holding their value and they're not watching their investments or their money that
[02:16:53.840 --> 02:17:00.560]  they've stored and put away devaluate and just continue to depreciate you know and buy less
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:04.800]  they're watching it go up or actually hold on to its purchasing power where the dollar
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:10.320]  continues to fall and that every time you see these this monkey business going on in washington dc
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:16.400]  about raising the debt ceiling or there's another government buyout or bail out or or more printing
[02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:21.600]  debts going on or the fed is taking on more us government treasuries you can know that you're
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:28.320]  not a part of that because gold and silver stands completely a side of that it is there's no relation
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:34.160]  absolutely and and to explain how you can offer two silver dollars at 80 dollars folks you can't
[02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:39.600]  find them in the market for that anywhere two silver dollars for 80 dollars when when gold's
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:45.760]  again right at 40 today and a book that retails at 1995 big brother welly and nightmare come true
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:52.560]  and the american dream dvd uh animated documentary which is really entertaining and so it's good for
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:58.240]  the general zombie public it's very well done very entertaining how can we give them a film that
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:03.760]  retails for you know 10 bucks a book that retails for 1995 free shipping that for these two you know
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:08.640]  the book the video and the silver dollars i know it's costing more than 10 bucks how can you do that
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:14.400]  for 80 it's because when they drove silver down by 15 bucks you knew what was going to happen you
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:20.480]  went and bought a ton load of it so now you can offer these videos and lose a little money because
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:24.800]  i've seen the rate sheet on this it is a lost leader but that's how you can have a lost leader
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:30.000]  that's this good i hope people take advantage of this special but when they call i don't just ask
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:33.920]  for the american dream special for the free book and free dvd and free shipping with two silver

[02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:27.520]  your right we're back live ladies and gentlemen let's go to steven florida steve you're on the
[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:33.280]  air thanks for holding yeah hey good afternoon out i'm glad you had your last guest on and what
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:37.440]  you guys talked about with eugenics because it ties in with what i wanted to bring up
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:44.480]  you know you know this as well as i do that a morally deprived and spiritually banked up people
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:50.480]  cannot oppose successfully and therefore defeat evil and there's nothing that the epitome of
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:55.840]  evil more than the new world order and oh that's why you focus so much on what their agenda is and
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:25:00.800]  what they're carrying out the ruling class has published hundreds of books that we have bought
[02:25:00.800 --> 02:25:06.720]  and read by the entire leadership all they talk about is spiking food water and vaccines with
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:13.600]  stuff to give us cancer and sterilizes the cancer is doubling the diabetes they're murdering us
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:19.760]  50 years ago you couldn't find kids with cancer now they're everywhere i see children in public at
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:25.440]  restaurants half of them look like they're mentally retarded they're murdering us and and and and and
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:29.680]  we can't get mad at the public for being ignorant and dumbed down they've been under chemical and
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:35.040]  biological and radiological attack they've been putting radiation particles in our drinking
[02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:40.720]  water for 50 years i mean they're killing us of course we're screwed up i'm sorry go ahead yeah
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:46.080]  and so here's what i'm to say you know there's one element of the new world order's agenda
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:51.520]  you may have touched on this briefly but i haven't heard you cover it at length and i'm not being
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:55.760]  like the guy i called earlier trying to get you to do things when you're already so busy
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:26:00.800]  people had accused you not doing enough that's that's a facade but here's what i want to say
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:07.920]  you know back in the 30s through the 50s the rock of flowers and the Ford Foundation funded
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:13.040]  what became the catalyst to destroy the moral foundation of this country now they funded the
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:20.080]  fake they they funded the fake counterculture no not not even that the work of Alfred Kinsey
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:26.320]  this guy single-handedly destroyed the moral foundation of our country and set us up to be
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:32.240]  the willing slaves of the new world no he wrote books and said that was his plan and then was it
[02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:38.400]  Skinner or was it Kinsey i've read it who wrote beyond good and evil and then they talked about
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:43.120]  one of them kept his son in a box till he died and now that's hailed as loving and liberal i mean
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:49.280]  i know these people are just absolutely monstrous they promote pedophilia you name it well the thing
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:55.360]  with Kinsey is out i mean you talk about you talk today about abortion and we have divorce and you
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:27:01.680]  know out of wedlock first and you know on and on i mean at the pedophilia and folks think it's all cute
[02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:07.200]  and funny well you notice with all that comes depression and collapse society so folks you
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:12.640]  think it's cool you're going to get a front row seat to hell and i'm not talking about when you
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:19.440]  die i'm talking about society is degenerating right what i'm saying is though in the porn industry
[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:25.600]  this is all tied into the work of out for kenzie and there's a woman dr juda threesome and you
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:31.520]  go to kenzie syndrome dot com she's done tons of research because one of her children her child was
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:37.440]  molested and that's how she got into this and the porn industry i mean vehemently opposed her
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:42.960]  and alex i'm telling you this guy kenzie is the key to where we're at in america today
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:49.600]  globalists know this they funded him and they got on the brooks changed in the us penal system now
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:54.560]  against sex crimes and you know we got all the sort of stuff going on and it's because of the work
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:28:00.080]  of kenzie and so if people will check that out man you're going to find out that that's really why
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:05.440]  we're no no they admit they admit that they want to destroy every basic underpinning so they can
[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:12.080]  remake us in their image which is uh absolute hell uh hell on earth well let's talk to michael
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:17.760]  in florida another caller from florida welcome michael hey alex yes sir yeah you you and your
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:23.840]  guests you guys are right on point you know i see a lot of these things happen i'm white black and
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:31.360]  native american and you know when my wife was pregnant she used to you know disrespect me and
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:37.600]  be like i'm gonna abort the child and stuff and you know she went ahead and sick the the child
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:45.440]  support people on me just to like and and gives me war about no under the fake liberal system they
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:51.120]  admit this when they set it up a hundred years ago they said the women will be the house slaves
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:56.240]  we will train the women to go to the state and the state's really their husband and then that's why a
[02:28:56.240 --> 02:29:00.240]  lot of women are like i'll use the state on you while they're drinking their bisphenol a that's
[02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:03.680]  going to give them breast cancer while they're feeding their baby and bisphenol a that's going
[02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:09.600]  to make the boy a feminine what i wanted to say about this conspiracy because i heard you talking
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:16.240]  to the dude uh oh you you're watching youtube and uh all this little stuff he was saying it's like
[02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:22.560]  they they want to support lies okay and if by uncovering these things there's a paper trail
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:28.000]  that goes back not only to the money in this country but documents books that they wrote
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:34.320]  you know i i hope you revamp some of your videos because a lot of things that you said have actually
[02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:41.040]  happened so people saying conspiracy what uh versus what actually is that needs to get out there no no
[02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:47.120]  i hear you sir fall the republic obama deception made two years ago all came true i mean you watch
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:54.000]  those it's like we had a time machine and took you into the future we're on the march the empires on
[02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:05.040]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network hi folks this is alex jones i'm looking for people

[02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:10.560]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:15.440]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:31:15.440 --> 02:31:21.040]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:26.080]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:31.200]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:35.360]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:40.720]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[02:31:40.720 --> 02:31:45.200]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:50.800]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com

[02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:15.680]  i saw this a few days ago and never knew really what to make of it but i'm going to cover it now
[02:33:17.360 --> 02:33:24.800]  all non-avricans part neanderthal genetics confirm is your heritage is a non-avrican
[02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:30.720]  you are part neanderthal according to a new study in the july issue of molecular biology and evolution
[02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:37.440]  discovery news has been reporting on human neanderthal inner breeding for some time now
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:43.600]  so this latest research confirms earlier findings damien labuda of the university of montreal's
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:50.000]  department of pediatrics and chu santa justine research center conducted the study with his
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:55.840]  colleagues they determined that some of the human x chromosome originates from neanderthals but only
[02:33:55.840 --> 02:34:00.560]  in people of non-avrican heritage this confirms recent findings suggesting the two populations
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:07.760]  underbred labuda was quoted as saying in a press release his team believes most of not all of the
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:12.640]  inner breeding took place in the middle east what's the bible say it says there were different
[02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:18.880]  groups of humans that intermarried the sons of men manipulated the genes while modern humans were
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:24.160]  migrating out of africa and spreading to other regions the ancestors of neanderthals left africa
[02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:29.840]  400 to 800 thousand years ago who knows if any of that's true evolved over the millennium mostly
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:34.240]  in what are now france spain germany and russia they went extinct or were simply absorbed in the
[02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:39.040]  modern human population about 30 000 years ago neanderthals possessed the gene for language
[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:44.000]  and had a sophisticated music art and tool craftsmanship see the eugenicists that's why they
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:48.240]  think whites are superior they've been saying this for a hundred years that um nord europeans are
[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:54.880]  part neanderthal and have different brain makeup so they have uh not been all that unattractive to
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:35:00.880]  modern humans at the time in addition because of methods were totally independent of neanderthal
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:06.080]  material we can also include that previous results were not influenced by contaminated artifacts
[02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:11.840]  and uh this work goes back nearly a decade ago when labuda and his colleagues identified a piece of
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:19.200]  dna called hapo type in the human x chromosome that seemed different they questioned its origins
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:25.040]  fast forward to 2010 when the neanderthal genome was sequenced the human genome project boys and
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:33.120]  girls the eugenicist operation the researchers could then uh compare the uh haplotype to the
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:38.960]  neanderthal genome as well as the dna of existing humans the scientists found that the sequence was
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:44.400]  present in humans across all continents except for sub-saharan africa and including australia
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:51.440]  uh the uh aborigines there there's little doubt that the uh hapo type is present because of the
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:57.920]  mating with our ancestors and neanderthals said nick paterson of the broad institute of mit
[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:02.000]  and harvard university princeton did not participate in the latest research yet this is very nice
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:07.280]  result and further analysis may help determine more details david rike at the harvard medical
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:12.560]  school geneticists added dr labuda and his colleagues were the first to identify a genetic
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:18.880]  variation in non-africans that was likely to have come from an archaic population this was done
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:24.080]  entirely without the neanderthal genome sequence but in light of the neanderthal sequence it's
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:29.600]  now clear that they were absolutely right the modern human neanderthal combo likely benefited
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:34.640]  our species enabling it to survive in harsh cold regions the neanderthals previously had adapted to
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:41.040]  variability is very important in long-term survival of a species uh the scientists want to
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:48.640]  say every addition of the genome can be enriching now hybridization they say the neanderthals also
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:56.000]  had ancestral memories call them instincts very interesting ladies and gentlemen i don't know
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:03.280]  what you call them but i sure have strong instincts okay um continuing here with the news ladies and
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:12.320]  gentlemen uh cern gags physicist in cosmic ray climate experiment what do these results mean
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:18.160]  not allowed to tell you and then it goes into i don't know the results it says they found basically
[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:23.840]  the same thing that the previous studies did by separate scientists working on this project and
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:29.840]  they found more than 20 years ago hey it's not potash of volcanic ash it's the main driver
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:37.120]  of nuclei that helps form droplets it's different particles many meteorites by the
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:43.440]  billions that come into the atmosphere other tiny particles charge particles solar radiation
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:48.480]  the list goes on and on coming in and that's why obviously when you're facing the sun there's a lot
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:54.480]  more of these and cloud formation during the day not just causing evaporation and they don't like
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:38:00.400]  this that's why the un uh came out two years ago and said look and i'm going to your calls in a minute
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:08.000]  said hey it's our carbon tax event Copenhagen we're going to have a vote here of the politicians
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:12.880]  that the sun is on effect climate it's all humans and they struck the gavel and said that's right
[02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:22.880]  we vote the earth is flat Copernicus is wrong and now when cern finds this this is in the
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:29.120]  register newspaper they're not allowed to report their findings but then it says that it was researching
[02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:34.720]  the other findings that found us the main driver see see if they can't blame climate change which
[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:38.720]  is of course the climate is changing all the time it was once one continent
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:47.840]  pangea i mean i mean did humans doing that did did cows flatulating do that no cows didn't exist
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:55.840]  then cern gags physicists and cosmic ray climate experiment the chief of the world's leading
[02:38:55.840 --> 02:39:00.960]  physics lab at cern in geneva has prohibited scientists from drawing conclusions from a major
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:08.160]  experiment the cloud cosmic leaving outdoor droplets experiment examines the role of energetic
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:18.800]  particles from deep space play in cloud formation cloud uses cern's proton cyclotron to examine
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:29.200]  the particle cern director general ralph deeter howler told welt online that the scientist should
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:35.040]  refrain from drawing conclusions from the latest experiment i have asked the colleagues to present
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:42.080]  the results clearly but not to interpret them yes reports veteran science editor nigel calder
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:52.400]  why because howler says that would go immediately into highly political area of the climate change
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:58.400]  debate one has to make clear the cosmic radiation is only one of many parameters see they're telling
[02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:05.520]  you who we found that this is the main driver but there's many things no no no nobody the un
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:14.960]  says no effect my breathing is the main effect i'm gonna fire devil gas out right now i'm blowing
[02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:19.680]  out carbon dioxide just death in fact if one of my crew came in here and i was to breathe on him
[02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:25.440]  it would kill them not the bad breath the carbon dioxide nerve gas devil weapon
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:33.440]  they say so the usual gagging the unusual the unusual gagging order could have been
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:40.960]  issued because the cloud results are really really boring uses calder oh that's a joke
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:48.000]  or is it could it be that the experiment invites a politically unacceptable hypothesis on the
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:55.520]  climate the cloud experiment builds on earlier experiments by danish physicist hennrick savas
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:02.560]  mark who demonstrated that cosmic rays provide a seed for clouds tiny charges and changes in the
[02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:09.840]  clouds covering the earth cover tiny changes in the earth's cloud cover could account for
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:16.160]  variations in temperatures of several degrees the amount of ultra fine condensation nuclei
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:25.280]  ufc n material depends on the quality of the background drizzle of the rays which varies
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:32.400]  depending on the strength of the sun's magnetic field and the strength of the earth's magnetic field
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:40.560]  how much so speaking at a private event attended by l reg earlier this year the scientist who has
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:48.320]  nothing to do with the cloud experiment wouldn't be drawn he said he thought it was one of four
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:56.080]  significant factors man-made factors volcanoes and regime shift in the mid 70s and cosmic rays
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:02.080]  the quality of and quantity of cosmic rays therefore has an influence on climate but
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:11.280]  this isn't factored into the ipcc that's the un group consensus science at all cern has joined
[02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:16.560]  a long line of lesser institutions obliged to remain politically correct about the man-made
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:23.280]  global warming hypothesis it's okay to enter the highly political area of the climate change debate
[02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:30.560]  provided your results endorse man-made warming but not if they support the heresy that it is the sun
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:36.960]  but alters the climate by influencing the cosmic ray influx and cloud formation let's hope he's
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:43.040]  been misquoted the precedents aren't happy okay stopping right there then i want to go to your
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:47.680]  calls and some other news for you in the broadcast today i've babbled through that i'm not a teleprompter
[02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:53.120]  reader sorry um you know what i'm going to admit something right now on air and i'm going to
[02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:59.360]  apologize to everybody i have been an extremist evil person reading hundreds of studies that
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:04.640]  have come out in the last 20 years that the sun is the main driver of climate uh that is extreme
[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:10.400]  that is sickening and that is ridiculous everyone knows the sun has no effect on the earth the giant
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:15.840]  gas ball that heats the planet and is the source of all life i'm sorry everyone knows i was having
[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:20.640]  a little slip back into reality there i want to be politically correct whoa when the un says
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:25.920]  like nevada can said 500 years ago that the earth was still the center of the universe when it was
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:31.360]  proven by galileo that it wasn't they were reasonable it's good to have a bunch of old men that do
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:36.320]  nothing about science telling a scientist he was wrong and it's good to have the un politically
[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:41.840]  vote that the sun doesn't affect climate i mean that's common sense folks the sun does not affect
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:47.840]  climate we have before seasons because there are hundreds of little magic fairies that fly around
[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:54.480]  the earth creating light when they go to sleep that's night when the fairies wake up that is
[02:43:54.480 --> 02:43:59.760]  causing the sun to shine i i mean the the the light to be there excuse me excuse me i was
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:06.240]  being extremist again um and so totally reasonable that humans are evil and bad we should all pay
[02:44:06.240 --> 02:44:12.720]  carbon taxes to nate roth child and al gore and bill clinton uh immediately because after all
[02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:17.040]  they're trying to save us and they also were talking about you know what's actually happening
[02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:24.320]  in australian europe huge taxes on all farm animals sheep cows chickens because they passed gas
[02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:30.080]  methane gas namely and that's going to kill the earth uh because there weren't birds and bovine
[02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:37.440]  and and sheep living in giant herds and flocks all over the planet uh previous to domestication
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:42.880]  in fact i've looked at actuaries on it there were actually more bovine water buffalo uh
[02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:52.000]  uh yaks um i mean that whole class that whole group um buffalo in north america they didn't
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:57.920]  exist and thank goodness if they did exist that al gore would have gone on a time machine
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:02.320]  to tax them because if he wouldn't have gotten a time machine thousands of years ago when there
[02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:07.840]  were all these forms of cows running around eating and passing gas with their multiple
[02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:13.360]  stomachs we would be dead right now do you understand how deadly creatures on this planet passing
[02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:21.760]  gases it actually makes up our atmosphere but it's evil it's evil okay so i just again i can't
[02:45:21.760 --> 02:45:30.960]  believe how i think god they're taxing cows they're so evil and by the way plankton and bacteria
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:37.760]  let off gas oh yes oh my gosh they're gonna kill us and trees put off oxygen even more evil
[02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:44.400]  um i mean with a straight face they sit there and tell us carbon dioxide is evil when they've
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:49.600]  done ice core studies back 200 000 years ago and found it to be 14 times higher 200 000 years ago
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:54.880]  and that were in an oxygen carbon dioxide starved level and then our atmosphere is actually thinner
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:46:01.600]  than it was from the different uh ice core and mud samples they've gotten out of peak bogs but again
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:07.200]  the sun does not affect the climate that's like saying these lights in here don't
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:14.480]  illuminate me for the camera it's that ridiculous but i am politically correct and i think it's
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:18.560]  reasonable the royal family says you shouldn't have more than one child and ted turner says it
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:25.440]  when they've got four or five children i think that's reasonable i'm sick of people that don't
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:32.720]  do what al gore says johnny in colorado another sicko go ahead johnny hey sir um it's an honor
[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:38.400]  to talk to you um hold on you don't think the sun affects the earth do you oh i really think it does
[02:46:39.680 --> 02:46:45.920]  extremist okay i'm sorry did you just get out of a mental institution no i did not i learned that
[02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:50.880]  in elementary school though well those were out those were the old america those were people were
[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:56.880]  you were probably actually an al-qaeda base did you did you go to school in afghanistan no only
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:04.160]  backwards taliban would teach that i'm sorry extremist climate denier go ahead go ahead evil
[02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:09.120]  um i guess i'll start with that yeah over the past week on the radio i've been hearing about a
[02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:15.680]  this new agenda or this new radio ad and it's called 350.org and it's basically them talking about
[02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:21.920]  if carbon dioxide goes over 350 of the atmosphere no she's like we've had more disasters than ever
[02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:27.200]  everyone's in trouble it's time to stop denying it pay al gore all our money yes i've seen it
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:31.920]  we're gonna play it a moment go ahead uh they're saying like the world will end if it goes over
[02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:37.200]  through 50 like all life on earth will end yeah that matter of carbon dioxide was 14 times higher
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:43.840]  i know it's it's it's sir sir if they're trying to save you right now nat roth child needs more
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:49.600]  yachts he owns the carbon trading company you're gonna pay he only wants to save you
[02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:57.040]  right and then uh also i heard uh the radio i mean the cops in colorado now are starting
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:48:02.880]  to have those license plate scanners that's good yeah yeah that's that really sucks but all over
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:08.160]  the country they're banning free speech too isn't that good that's soon they'll say it never existed
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:11.600]  you'll be a conspiracy theorist if you ever said you had a right to own a gun i'm sick
[02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:15.680]  let's hope it doesn't get there what other extremism johnny did you comment about
[02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:20.480]  actually i want to comment on that guy i was like you need to do more and then i think uh
[02:48:21.040 --> 02:48:24.800]  there's nothing more important or one of the most important things that you should do is a
[02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:29.920]  your social networking thing because google just came out the social networking google plus youtube
[02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:35.680]  just came out the social networking and i really think if you make yours people jump on that i know
[02:48:35.680 --> 02:48:40.880]  it's a money issue the it folks we've got are always busy fixing old things or and we're trying
[02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:45.520]  to hire another person it's all monetary and i'd rather have a commercial free show but people
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:49.760]  need to buy the books buy the videos buy the t-shirts because that's how we fund this whole
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:55.360]  thing god bless you johnny in fact just for johnny here's the tv ad the radio ad uh
[02:48:56.800 --> 02:49:00.800]  okay we'll play it during the next segment we'll go to another call right now uh let's go ahead
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:05.920]  and talk to john in new york another person that probably thinks the sun is what heats the earth
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:14.400]  these people are crazy john go ahead what a fool i am i do believe it i'm sorry go ahead
[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:20.400]  elix i just uh want to let people know ron paul's having a ready games fire money bomb today
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:26.960]  tell them build momentum for the august 13th isle straw pole his websites ron paul2012.com
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:32.320]  and i think if he wins the early primaries the mainstream media won't be able to marginalize
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:37.200]  him what do you think i agree and he's bigger than ever and um he's winning a lot of the big straw
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:42.800]  polls in places like new hampshire we need to get 100 get behind ron paul he's halfway there
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:49.920]  he's at 231 right now he's trying to get 500 000 but you see if i say ron paul doesn't exist and
[02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:58.080]  laugh at you are you a conspiracy theorist ron paul doesn't exist well you had his brother on so he
[02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:02.800]  exists no but see that's the level it's reached now when the tsa grabs your genitals and you say
[02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:09.120]  don't do that they they then call you a conspiracy theorist now even saying i like chevy better than
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:14.560]  ford if you have an opinion other than what they tell you it doesn't exist so so the sun doesn't
[02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:19.920]  heat the earth uh we never had free speech parents shouldn't be able to pack their kids school
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:24.880]  launches you shouldn't be able to have a garden in your yard and i'm not sure ron paul even exist
[02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:31.920]  well i've seen them and i gotta believe it oh sure the new york times just four years ago or three
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:36.560]  years ago said i was delusional and was it an imaginary bill berg group meeting in virginia
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:40.160]  that hillary and obama were at and i called the media and said there's the secret service they
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:44.480]  just drove in the media laughed at me and then the new york times came out when they made the film
[02:50:44.480 --> 02:50:50.000]  about me new world order and said that i was having a schizophrenic episode at a hotel that the world
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:56.560]  only were there so see i'm insane you're insane the sun doesn't heat the earth your evil will come

[02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:10.080]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:52:10.080 --> 02:52:15.120]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:52:15.120 --> 02:52:20.720]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:52:20.720 --> 02:52:25.840]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:31.120]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[02:52:31.120 --> 02:52:35.600]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power

[02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:24.480]  of the next hour is internet only info works dot com audio stream present planet dot tv so i can get
[02:54:24.480 --> 02:54:27.920]  to all the callers at least that have been holding the longest uh who's up next here john
[02:54:29.840 --> 02:54:33.760]  all right it's dolin matthew kevin jc i'll get to those four at least sorry to the others
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:37.760]  but i wanted to play this sad we couldn't find the one we found last week where they really
[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:43.120]  fairmongered but ellen page and another p-brain well-meaning useful idiot doesn't even know she's
[02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:49.600]  working for global nazis um you know putting out oh my gosh we've had droughts and tornadoes and
[02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:55.840]  volcanoes and it's the carbon dioxide help me the earth has always had disasters
[02:54:56.880 --> 02:55:04.000]  pompeh in rome you know thousands of years ago destroying whole cities now there's also
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:10.480]  weather modification going on they've declassified it is going on on a geopolitical level uh a global
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:16.720]  level uh they call it um it's not terraforming because our planet's already alive they call it
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:21.520]  geoengineering and they've got pentagon reports they're declassified that they're engaged in it

[02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:16.080]  thing that sound reasonable but the agenda is carbon taxes a billion dead in the next decade
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:20.640]  conservatively in the third world and let me give you a little news flash they told the third world
[02:57:20.640 --> 02:57:27.760]  we're going to cut the funding of the west and give you the money when they finally got the treaty
[02:57:28.480 --> 02:57:33.520]  when they got the treaty two years ago Copenhagen it was right at double the taxes on the third
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:38.800]  world that they put on the west this is a death sentence this is a destroy industrialization
[02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:43.200]  of the third world that would actually handle people having quote too many children once you
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:48.720]  industrialize on average you have 1.5 children for every two adults that's not even replacement rate

[03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:09.920]  the sky and i thought what in that is that they now admit the total weather manipulation globally
[03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:14.160]  they just admit it but it's not a big issue it's just oh yeah we admit we're doing it it's secret

[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:37.120]  ground all the airplanes i gotta tell you in the last year or so even though they announced they
[03:01:37.120 --> 03:01:41.280]  were going to increase them in their quote geoengineering testing the whiteout science are
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:47.440]  said i've seen less chemtrails generally but then when they are doing them they're more intense
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:51.600]  and it's generally when a weather system's coming in you know they fly in and block the
[03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:57.520]  weather system i've watched that alex i called you for another reason did you see the article on
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:02:04.560]  rand paul and american free pass press uh june 13th no but i know the southern poverty slime
[03:02:04.560 --> 03:02:12.400]  center has come out and demonized him i got i'll tell you this necessarily hit me hard it says here
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:17.680]  ran paul ran the foul of the libertarian supporters recently when he stated on nil
[03:02:17.680 --> 03:02:23.680]  conservative song hannity's real show that anyone in the united states who tend to controversial
[03:02:23.680 --> 03:02:29.760]  speech in this country should be arrested and deported not surprising me hannity did not disagree
[03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:35.200]  with rand attack on american first amendment right to assemble and hear free speeches wait a minute
[03:02:35.200 --> 03:02:38.560]  wait a minute wait a minute he might have been being sarcastic i mean that would be political
[03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:43.280]  suicide i'll have to look into that what was the headline on the article and i'll look it up page
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:49.920]  eight of uh june 13th and 20th american free press no i'm i know that but what's the headline
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:57.200]  ran paul have a case deportation prison for radical thinkers that's that's on the headline of his
[03:02:57.200 --> 03:03:02.480]  little article and on the on the front of the page it says bill de berger's meeting secret
[03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:09.120]  ran paul advocates deportation for what deportation prison for radical thinkers
[03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:14.880]  you know when i read this it did you know i fell out of the chair because
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:23.520]  you know i can't you know his father's a mason that bothers me well number one ron paul is not
[03:03:23.520 --> 03:03:27.920]  a mason i mean people the number one i'm not catholic i'm not even saying that's a bad thing but
[03:03:27.920 --> 03:03:32.960]  people say i'm a you know vatican ninja uh people also you know you know say a lot of other things
[03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:38.160]  say i'm you know living israel never been to israel people make up a lot of stuff but ron paul is
[03:03:38.160 --> 03:03:47.040]  not a mason from the research i've done uh but uh yeah i mean here's here's salon ran paul deport
[03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:52.720]  the tea partiers and uh i would imagine this was some type of flippant comment because it sounds
[03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:59.200]  like one i mean that would be ran paul's really smart 100 first amendment tea party senator ran paul
[03:03:59.200 --> 03:04:03.040]  says he supports free speech but does but does he actually think his own supporters
[03:04:03.040 --> 03:04:08.800]  jailed for sedition and a stupid economist ad just popped up in front of it and i'll have to look
[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:13.440]  into this and cover it more paul is mostly good on civil liberties but he was one of a few senators
[03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:18.320]  to oppose the extension of the patriot act see and he goes on but on shonhandy's radio show last
[03:04:18.320 --> 03:04:23.600]  friday paul announced the support for the deportation of tea partiers i'm not for profiling people on
[03:04:23.600 --> 03:04:28.240]  the floor color of skin or on the religion but i would take to account that they've been traveling
[03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:33.120]  and perhaps you might have to indirectly take into account whether or not they've been going into
[03:04:33.120 --> 03:04:39.920]  radical political speeches by religious leaders it would be that it it would be that they are islamic
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:44.880]  but if someone is attending speeches for someone who is promoting the violent overthrow of our
[03:04:44.880 --> 03:04:51.200]  government that's really an offense that should be going after they should be deported so he's
[03:04:51.200 --> 03:04:56.800]  talking about i think foreigner muslims saying overthrow the u.s government and that was i'm
[03:04:56.800 --> 03:04:59.200]  gonna have to look more into this i don't i don't know people are talking about

[03:06:17.760 --> 03:06:23.680]  in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:06:23.680 --> 03:06:29.280]  as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[03:06:29.280 --> 03:06:35.680]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[03:06:35.680 --> 03:06:40.640]  government tem geithner bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[03:06:40.640 --> 03:06:45.360]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:52.960]  washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic on dvd

[03:07:00.560 --> 03:07:05.200]  there's a man named dr walloch who is anything but your typical doctor both a veterinary and a
[03:07:05.200 --> 03:07:11.360]  naturopathic physician doc asks why does the united states spend more money on health care by far
[03:07:11.360 --> 03:07:16.560]  and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide he believes that people should empower
[03:07:16.560 --> 03:07:22.080]  themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition taking charge of their life and attain optimal
[03:07:22.080 --> 03:07:27.680]  health and longevity through nutrition not by toxic prescription drugs leading to side effects
[03:07:27.680 --> 03:07:32.640]  this is clearly a deadly recipe the good news is doc walloch's message is resonating with an
[03:07:32.640 --> 03:07:37.840]  increasing number of americans who are waking up to all the big government big pharma manipulation
[03:07:37.840 --> 03:07:42.560]  of our health care system i like what doc walloch is saying and doing to enlighten people about
[03:07:42.560 --> 03:07:47.680]  health care and have joined forces to help this tireless crusader spread his message visit info
[03:07:47.680 --> 03:07:53.600]  wars team dot com and listen to dr walloch's deadly recipes lecture it makes a lot of sense and i

[03:08:10.080 --> 03:08:19.680]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network see it's
[03:08:19.680 --> 03:08:24.000]  happening right now i was going to do a few minutes extra overdrive to take some calls
[03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:27.840]  and a caller that's why i love taking calls brings up an issue i didn't know about
[03:08:27.840 --> 03:08:31.280]  during the break i went and looked it up we're going to play the audio here in a moment
[03:08:31.920 --> 03:08:36.320]  ran poll to port the tea partiers and and the fella called in with a similar headline
[03:08:36.320 --> 03:08:42.640]  that's not exactly what he said but i disagree with what he did say even though it's a very short
[03:08:42.640 --> 03:08:46.960]  clip and i've got to do some more research it doesn't sound good and i've seen him stand up
[03:08:46.960 --> 03:08:51.920]  against the patriot act stand up against the wars the debt ceiling he's done everything he said he
[03:08:51.920 --> 03:08:59.440]  would do and i've been very pleased um but this is not something in here ron paul say the kentucky
[03:08:59.440 --> 03:09:04.080]  senator calls for those who attend radical political speeches to be jailed that's the salon
[03:09:04.080 --> 03:09:12.560]  headline and i didn't know about this this happened uh this happened a few weeks ago
[03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:20.400]  yeah um this happened back in um actually back in june so uh and when you actually get the quote
[03:09:21.680 --> 03:09:27.600]  he was saying it wouldn't be that they're islamic but if someone is attending speeches from someone
[03:09:27.600 --> 03:09:32.560]  who is promoting the violent overthrow of the government that's really an offense that we
[03:09:32.560 --> 03:09:42.880]  should be going after going after they should be deported or put in prison now now wait a minute a
[03:09:42.880 --> 03:09:47.200]  if you're saying we should throw all the bums out we have a criminal government occupying us
[03:09:47.840 --> 03:09:52.320]  and if the government continues to stomp on our liberties it's our right our duty to
[03:09:54.080 --> 03:09:59.040]  remove that government and institute a new one and that's declaration of independence
[03:09:59.040 --> 03:10:07.360]  and uh he needs to clarify uh himself on this and then of course they go on to say oh if they're
[03:10:07.360 --> 03:10:11.600]  if they want the violent overthrow of the government well then lock up all tea party
[03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:15.440]  rally attendees so it's not it's enough it's bad enough to say arrest somebody
[03:10:15.440 --> 03:10:18.960]  who calls for the violent overthrow of the government i mean if you say the government's
[03:10:18.960 --> 03:10:24.640]  corrupt we have a right to you know defend our liberties and if this government gets pushy
[03:10:24.640 --> 03:10:31.040]  we have a right to do that physically that's 1776 and you know we've had discussions about
[03:10:32.240 --> 03:10:36.080]  when is the proper time for that there's no doubt it's our right and and and duty
[03:10:36.080 --> 03:10:40.960]  and and freedom if we decide that that's the time under the declaration of independence if you
[03:10:40.960 --> 03:10:44.400]  don't believe in that you don't believe the declaration of independence and in july 4th
[03:10:44.400 --> 03:10:50.000]  i mean that's why we have july 4th 1776 so read the declaration of independence and
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:59.040]  uh but continuing here um to say that people that are attending what if you're just walking down the
[03:10:59.040 --> 03:11:04.080]  mall at the there in dc and you hear a speech and and it's a it's say uh
[03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:14.160]  some type of radical speaker whether they're muslim christian whatever the case is atheist
[03:11:14.160 --> 03:11:18.560]  and they talk about if the government keeps getting pushy we're gonna have to have 1776
[03:11:18.560 --> 03:11:22.080]  and go to the cartridge box you know if you heard somebody hypothetically say that would
[03:11:22.080 --> 03:11:27.840]  everyone there be arrested and deported that's a dangerous talk now this is only 38 seconds
[03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:33.440]  long and it's from think progress which has been george for soros funded in my research so i've
[03:11:33.440 --> 03:11:39.360]  got to find out more and try to find the original archive of this back in june uh to see if this is
[03:11:39.360 --> 03:11:44.400]  accurate because i've had different groups added together what i've said before so uh we'll have
[03:11:44.400 --> 03:11:47.840]  to investigate this but since the guy brought it up we're discussing it let's go ahead and play that
[03:11:47.840 --> 03:11:52.720]  clip and you set yourself up to be called the bigot because now you want to profile people
[03:11:52.720 --> 03:11:57.520]  the airport well you can't win rand i mean they've got an answer for everything but here's the thing
[03:11:57.520 --> 03:12:02.880]  john is i'm not for profiling people on the color of their skin or on their religion but i would
[03:12:02.880 --> 03:12:08.720]  take into account where they've been traveling and perhaps you might have to indirectly take into
[03:12:08.720 --> 03:12:14.240]  account whether or not they've been going to radical uh political speeches by religious leaders
[03:12:14.240 --> 03:12:19.440]  that it wouldn't be that they are islamic but if someone is attending speeches from someone who
[03:12:19.440 --> 03:12:23.360]  is promoting the violent overthrow of our government that's really an offense that we
[03:12:23.360 --> 03:12:29.840]  should be going after they should be deported or put in prison well there you have it uh ladies and
[03:12:29.840 --> 03:12:35.440]  gentlemen um jaren was popping in my ear saying chickens come home to roost and i
[03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:46.080]  uh oh obama and reverend right and reverend right's chicken comes home to roost speech now i remember
[03:12:46.080 --> 03:12:52.880]  that absolutely so are we saying deport not or arrest reverend right but also obama
[03:12:55.040 --> 03:13:03.200]  or i've heard uh wow that that's a good point jaren now i do hear the context now they're talking
[03:13:03.200 --> 03:13:09.680]  about tsa they're talking about profiling in airports and they're talking about should it go into
[03:13:09.680 --> 03:13:17.840]  account um that if somebody is part of a group basically calling for violence and he's implying
[03:13:17.840 --> 03:13:22.160]  outside groups but we'll have to get a clarification i bet there's a clarification because if i missed
[03:13:22.160 --> 03:13:26.640]  this in the last month i'm sure this has already been debated see folks that's why your calls are
[03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:29.920]  important your emails are important we miss a lot of things a lot of times i get an email or see a
[03:13:29.920 --> 03:13:34.400]  comment on my website info wars dot com why haven't you covered this how was your covering it up
[03:13:34.400 --> 03:13:40.000]  and i cover it that day because you told me about it i mean i'm not omnipresent uh i don't know what
[03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:43.680]  my children are doing right now with my wife i mean i don't i don't know what folks in the back
[03:13:43.680 --> 03:13:50.160]  of the office are doing uh but um i'm glad the caller brought that up but let me hear that clip
[03:13:50.160 --> 03:13:54.960]  one more time because i want to hear it and i wish i had it in full context this is with uh
[03:13:54.960 --> 03:14:00.480]  you're a great american shan hanity um being sarcastic always says you're a great american here it is
[03:14:01.120 --> 03:14:05.760]  and you set yourself up to be called the bigot because now you want to profile people the airport
[03:14:05.760 --> 03:14:09.680]  well you can't win rand i mean this they've got an answer for everything but here's the
[03:14:09.680 --> 03:14:14.720]  thing shan is i'm not for profiling people on the color of their skin or on their religion
[03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:20.080]  but i would take into account where they've been traveling and perhaps you might have to
[03:14:20.080 --> 03:14:25.760]  indirectly take into account whether or not they've been going to radical uh political speeches by
[03:14:25.760 --> 03:14:31.120]  religious leaders but it wouldn't be that they are islamic but if someone is uh attending speeches
[03:14:31.120 --> 03:14:35.520]  from someone who is promoting the violent overthrow of our government that's really an offense that
[03:14:35.520 --> 03:14:40.560]  we should be going after they should be deported or put in prison yeah i know he's talking now
[03:14:40.560 --> 03:14:45.040]  could clear that context was was about muslim quote extremist he's talking about people coming
[03:14:45.040 --> 03:14:51.280]  into the country and and profiling and deporting them of their calling for violence um and uh i'm
[03:14:51.280 --> 03:14:55.040]  sure when i do find his clarification because i'm sure this was a big issue that we missed
[03:14:55.040 --> 03:15:02.720]  that that's what he meant by it but it's still it's still um it doesn't pass the smell test does it
[03:15:03.360 --> 03:15:08.640]  so i will have to look into that i got time to jam in a few more calls but really quick folks i'd
[03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:12.000]  love to talk for hours but i've got to get in there and work on the new tv show i've got to get in
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:16.640]  there and work on all the other stuff we're doing i got to get this stuff on showed uh let's talk to
[03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:21.680]  matthew in tennessee matthew what do you think of that clip you just heard oh man there's all
[03:15:21.680 --> 03:15:25.680]  sorts of stuff that you can hear that's people trying to be politically correct people trying
[03:15:25.680 --> 03:15:32.880]  to say the right thing without saying the right thing yeah what'd you call about well we got three
[03:15:32.880 --> 03:15:37.120]  issues that we could potentially get to but maybe not enough time issue number one the resistance
[03:15:37.120 --> 03:15:43.040]  it's many people have recognized that the republic has fallen they feel isolated they feel frustrated
[03:15:43.040 --> 03:15:49.200]  one way to contact other people in the resistance wear an info wars t-shirt wear info wars t-shirt
[03:15:49.200 --> 03:15:54.400]  talk to people form the resistance cells number two tactic for the resistance contact people
[03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:59.440]  currently in the military by writing to them there is a great fear amongst those who are in
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:03.920]  the hierarchy that the united states military will not turn on the united states people
[03:16:03.920 --> 03:16:10.400]  number two the eugenics war in the eugenics war we've seen this calling on for a long time since
[03:16:10.400 --> 03:16:15.840]  the days of noah one of the things that we know is that when you manipulate the genome it degrades
[03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:22.080]  we found that with dolly the sheep even with an identical genome it degrades now let us consider
[03:16:22.080 --> 03:16:26.800]  that the manipulation of the genome has happened on this planet before with what you had referenced
[03:16:26.800 --> 03:16:33.360]  earlier the sons of god not the sons of adam sons of god interpret it as you will there are not
[03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:39.520]  around right now but we have a record of them as the giants what i have um and postulating is
[03:16:39.520 --> 03:16:44.400]  is that when you see people who are designed with blonde hair and blue eyes when the genome is
[03:16:44.400 --> 03:16:50.400]  corrupted if you can get the corruption attached to a recessive trait then you can breed out that
[03:16:50.400 --> 03:16:55.040]  recessive trait by breeding it with dominant traits so if you have a corrupted genome that has a
[03:16:55.040 --> 03:17:00.800]  quality that you like like intelligence breed it with someone with blonde hair and blue eyes and
[03:17:00.800 --> 03:17:05.360]  other recessive traits when you breed that person with another person with dominant traits you can
[03:17:05.360 --> 03:17:11.680]  breed out the corrupted traits number three what does god say about global warming and the fourth
[03:17:11.680 --> 03:17:16.720]  angel poured out his bowl in the sun and the sun was given power to scorch people with fire
[03:17:16.720 --> 03:17:22.240]  and they were seared with intense heat and they got the bible says the sun heats the earth modern
[03:17:22.240 --> 03:17:26.960]  scientists have disproven that the sun does not heat the earth according to al gore in the un
[03:17:26.960 --> 03:17:33.920]  well and not only that but we know from the bible that uh they would not they refuse to repent and
[03:17:33.920 --> 03:17:40.560]  glorify him meaning if you have the spirit of anti christ you worship man and not god so if you
[03:17:40.560 --> 03:17:45.040]  worship man and not god and god is causing the global warming the spirit of anti christ will
[03:17:45.040 --> 03:17:51.280]  compel you to blame global warming on man all right listen i appreciate your call i want to jam
[03:17:51.280 --> 03:17:56.480]  in one more i'm sorry to keller matt and john jc into mexico you're our tail gunner taking us out
[03:17:57.600 --> 03:18:02.080]  hey ellis how you doing i'm good my friend excellent i just have a real quick question
[03:18:02.080 --> 03:18:06.320]  because you know i've been a longtime fan uh first time caller uh i've listened to you
[03:18:06.320 --> 03:18:09.840]  however for you know the last couple of years i've seen a lot of your research i think you're
[03:18:09.840 --> 03:18:13.280]  doing an incredible job spraying the real information out there you know the info war
[03:18:13.280 --> 03:18:18.400]  going on and everything but i do have one question because uh even though i've listened to you
[03:18:18.400 --> 03:18:23.360]  you know great you know coverage on everything i want to know what is your mission what is
[03:18:24.160 --> 03:18:30.560]  your purpose for having your show been on for a long long time now having millions and millions
[03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:35.920]  of people who listen to your show and and and can do positive things with your information
[03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:41.040]  but what is what is your mission what do you want to you know accomplish in the next you know five
[03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:46.240]  years because of this window of time we have you know it's funny i had a hour long meeting
[03:18:46.240 --> 03:18:52.880]  yesterday with some of my crew about codifying our principles and he really stating them simply
[03:18:52.880 --> 03:18:57.760]  and then hammering them every day especially on the upcoming tv show so people simply know
[03:18:57.760 --> 03:19:02.960]  what we stand for but it's it's it's it's really simple at the end of the day i believe in humanity
[03:19:02.960 --> 03:19:09.040]  i believe in people having knowledge and and and not perishing uh whether it's economically
[03:19:09.040 --> 03:19:15.360]  physically spiritually and so i'm here to cover the hypocrisy cover the corruption cover history
[03:19:15.360 --> 03:19:20.800]  and point out how we're distracted but knowing that there are going to be great leaders and and
[03:19:20.800 --> 03:19:26.240]  people out there in society who are in the system who are outside of the system who will recognize
[03:19:26.240 --> 03:19:31.600]  what's happening i'm here to break the compartmentalization i'm here to get people to see outside the
[03:19:31.600 --> 03:19:37.280]  little fake boxes they've been put in and to encourage other media people i mean most media
[03:19:37.280 --> 03:19:41.440]  folks you see out there find the new order now they'll say they were inspired by alex jones
[03:19:41.440 --> 03:19:47.040]  most people you talk to will say alex jones was the first person woke me up there were many people
[03:19:47.040 --> 03:19:54.160]  that helped wake me up but but i've i have except for maybe a ron paul had the greatest effect uh
[03:19:54.160 --> 03:19:58.240]  and so that's my mission is just to simply point out what's happening i will be back
[03:19:58.240 --> 03:20:12.640]  after this break with retransmission see you back tomorrow night 11 a.m. central
