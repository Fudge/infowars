[00:00.000 --> 00:10.600]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:10.600 --> 00:20.080]  The war was lost, the treaty signed, I was not caught, I crossed the line, I was not
[00:20.080 --> 00:32.600]  caught, though many tried, I live among you, well disguised, I had to leave my life behind,
[00:32.600 --> 00:36.360]  I dug some graves, you'll never find.
[00:36.360 --> 00:42.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, all hell is breaking loose, and I couldn't be happier.
[00:42.960 --> 00:47.280]  Victory, victory, victory, victory.
[00:47.280 --> 00:52.720]  InfoWars is absolutely dominating, and the globalists are so upset.
[00:52.720 --> 00:58.840]  Look at these headlines, Chelsea, Clinton, Blast, Kelly, for Alex Jones interview, The
[00:58.840 --> 01:05.000]  Hill, Sandy Hook mom blasts Megan Kelly for upcoming Alex Jones interview, Megan Kelly,
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.640]  NBC under fire over sickening Alex Jones interview.
[01:09.640 --> 01:17.040]  This is totally coordinated NBC bull, this is all PR, especially out of Megan Kelly and
[01:17.040 --> 01:21.600]  Chelsea Clinton, who we know they hang out with.
[01:21.600 --> 01:28.000]  This is incredible, Megan Kelly lied to me and said it wasn't a hit piece, said that
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.200]  she wasn't going to get into these topics, and like Trump says, better watch out, there
[01:32.200 --> 01:38.040]  might be tapes, there's no question about there might be tapes, and I just knew I was
[01:38.040 --> 01:43.720]  walking into a trap because MSM doesn't get it, no matter what they do, no matter how they
[01:43.720 --> 01:47.960]  demonize me, they're already discredited, they have the zombies that watch them, but
[01:47.960 --> 01:50.280]  that's it.
[01:50.280 --> 01:53.520]  Everybody else then just gets reminded of the show so it grows even faster.
[01:53.520 --> 01:59.760]  Oh, and I love it, Chelsea, you're in the WikiLeaks talking about Haitians dying because
[01:59.760 --> 02:04.320]  of your foundation and how your mommy and how your daddy stole all the money, but you
[02:04.320 --> 02:06.960]  didn't do anything.
[02:06.960 --> 02:11.960]  And all the corruption and Jerry Epstein's pedophile airplane, all of it, you know what
[02:11.960 --> 02:16.200]  I'm going to do, I'm just going to come back in the next segment, and I'm going to lay
[02:16.200 --> 02:19.720]  out the whole Megan Kelly hit piece, and how they're going to edit it and what they're
[02:19.720 --> 02:23.040]  going to do because I already know, I already know.
[02:23.040 --> 02:27.880]  But remember what happened to old Katie Couric, remember what she did with her little gun
[02:27.880 --> 02:32.160]  control interview, remember that, where she'd ask him questions and then cut to them looking
[02:32.160 --> 02:37.760]  like they couldn't answer it or them taking a break or scratching their heads, it's amazing.
[02:37.760 --> 02:42.520]  And you talk about these criminal dynasties like the Clintons, and then they want to come
[02:42.520 --> 02:45.960]  out and demonize me because I question known liars.
[02:45.960 --> 02:52.840]  I question everything MSM says, these people are a joke.
[02:52.840 --> 02:59.400]  So that's all coming up today, ladies and gentlemen, it's simply amazing to see them.
[02:59.400 --> 03:03.080]  And of course, Megan Kelly interviewed me for four hours.
[03:03.080 --> 03:10.760]  We had a crew here from 9 30 in the morning till 10 45 at night, interviewing me at some
[03:10.760 --> 03:15.280]  house they rented and a barbecue place they rented out and here at my office.
[03:15.280 --> 03:21.440]  So they could edit it down to 11 minutes and then I saw their promo piece.
[03:21.440 --> 03:23.640]  I know it's edited questions together.
[03:23.640 --> 03:27.480]  I'm not saying it's Katie Couric level, at least till I see the broadcast, but they even
[03:27.480 --> 03:35.680]  lit me from one side villain lighting, villain lighting, why did they put a flashlight under
[03:35.680 --> 03:36.680]  my chin?
[03:36.680 --> 03:40.280]  Oh, look, she gets normal lighting.
[03:40.280 --> 03:43.760]  I get villain lighting.
[03:43.760 --> 03:45.080]  Isn't that just sweet?
[03:45.080 --> 03:46.280]  Isn't that just cute?
[03:46.280 --> 03:47.280]  Isn't that just nice?
[03:47.280 --> 03:51.440]  And it goes on and on and on and her on the phone, it's not a hit piece.
[03:51.440 --> 03:52.560]  I'm obsessed with you.
[03:52.560 --> 03:53.880]  I want to get a steak with you.
[03:53.880 --> 03:54.880]  I want to get dessert.
[03:54.880 --> 03:58.000]  I said, Megan, I know you're a lawyer and a hit operative and you're coming in here to
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.240]  do a hit piece off known talking points.
[04:00.240 --> 04:02.520]  It's going to be Sandy Hook, pizza, gay, blah, blah, blah.
[04:02.520 --> 04:03.520]  She's known.
[04:03.520 --> 04:06.520]  You know, I might let you clarify those, but that's not what it's about.
[04:06.520 --> 04:12.000]  And then she'd asked me each of those things five times so she could try to get some answer.
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.120]  She could stitch together amazing, absolutely amazing.
[04:18.120 --> 04:22.760]  And then they have Chelsea come out and the Democrats come out and criticize it so that
[04:22.760 --> 04:29.280]  it gets more hype to try to prop up her flagging show because Putin ran over because Putin
[04:29.280 --> 04:34.120]  only gave her a 15 minute interview so that she couldn't sit there and edit it together.
[04:34.120 --> 04:36.840]  So she needs this big win.
[04:36.840 --> 04:40.880]  And then Chelsea of the criminal Clinton Foundation weighs in.
[04:40.880 --> 04:43.480]  Oh, don't give this guy attention.
[04:43.480 --> 04:48.760]  Oh, oh, like I need attention on your stupid network.
[04:48.760 --> 04:49.760]  Unbelievable.
[04:49.760 --> 04:50.760]  Incredible.
[04:50.760 --> 04:54.280]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[04:54.280 --> 05:00.720]  And as usual, they've walked right into our trap.
[05:00.720 --> 05:05.360]  Some important revelations came out during James Comey's testimony.
[05:05.360 --> 05:09.760]  Democrats hoping to have Trump impeached for obstruction of justice were greatly let down
[05:09.760 --> 05:15.640]  when Comey's testimony revealed that President Trump was innocent of those false allegations.
[05:15.640 --> 05:20.560]  One revelation was that President Trump was not under investigation by the FBI.
[05:20.560 --> 05:26.360]  Dispelling rumors perpetuated by the mainstream media that Trump fired Comey as retaliation
[05:26.360 --> 05:28.400]  for investigating him.
[05:28.400 --> 05:33.640]  Another was that Comey admitted leaking his memos to the media, the memos that further
[05:33.640 --> 05:37.360]  stirred suspicions against Trump for alleged Russian involvement.
[05:37.360 --> 05:43.520]  However, coincidentally, the fact that Trump wasn't under FBI investigation was never leaked
[05:43.520 --> 05:44.520]  to the media.
[05:44.520 --> 05:49.320]  Comey's testimony also revealed that our suspicions about Bill Clinton and Loretta
[05:49.320 --> 05:55.240]  Lynch's bizarre meeting on the tarmac were valid and may even prompt further investigation.
[05:55.240 --> 05:57.960]  For more reports, go to infowars.com.
[05:57.960 --> 06:00.120]  This is Milly Weaver.
[06:00.120 --> 06:02.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[06:02.000 --> 06:04.000]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[06:04.000 --> 06:06.880]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[06:06.880 --> 06:12.920]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[06:12.920 --> 06:17.880]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[06:17.880 --> 06:22.840]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[06:22.840 --> 06:27.960]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[06:27.960 --> 06:29.680]  you can to purify your air.
[06:29.680 --> 06:34.720]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[06:34.720 --> 06:37.680]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[06:37.680 --> 06:39.880]  The general public doesn't.
[06:39.880 --> 06:43.840]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[06:43.840 --> 06:47.480]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[06:47.480 --> 06:51.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.200]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[06:54.200 --> 06:58.120]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarsstore.com.
[06:58.120 --> 07:04.440]  Let's go to Devin and Florida.
[07:04.440 --> 07:06.440]  Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
[07:06.440 --> 07:07.440]  Great.
[07:07.440 --> 07:08.440]  Hey, thank you so much.
[07:08.440 --> 07:12.440]  Listen, I have bought your product and I got to say they're amazing.
[07:12.440 --> 07:13.440]  Thank you.
[07:13.440 --> 07:18.600]  I'm going to spend and buy it because I've got caveman, supermanial vitality, secret
[07:18.600 --> 07:20.600]  swell, vitamin, mineral fusion.
[07:20.600 --> 07:22.160]  I've got the body armor.
[07:22.160 --> 07:23.160]  Wow, thank you.
[07:23.160 --> 07:25.440]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[07:25.440 --> 07:27.120]  Which nutraceuticals do you like best?
[07:27.120 --> 07:30.800]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest.
[07:30.800 --> 07:31.800]  That's amazing.
[07:31.800 --> 07:32.800]  That's really incredible.
[07:32.800 --> 07:35.200]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[07:35.200 --> 07:36.400]  I haven't felt sweet.
[07:36.400 --> 07:42.520]  My morning was fantastic and I love the guys, I love the info wars true and I just want
[07:42.520 --> 07:48.200]  to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[07:48.200 --> 07:49.200]  You will love it.
[07:49.200 --> 07:51.520]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[07:51.520 --> 07:55.840]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[07:55.840 --> 08:15.720]  It's a win-win infowarslife.com Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[08:15.720 --> 08:17.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[08:17.720 --> 08:23.600]  We're called info wars because there's a war on for your mind.
[08:23.600 --> 08:27.200]  We're here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[08:27.200 --> 08:31.520]  We're expanding info wars nightly news and soon a whole bunch of news syndicated radio
[08:31.520 --> 08:34.840]  slash TV transmissions.
[08:34.840 --> 08:38.920]  Infowars.com is the website because there's a war on for your mind.
[08:38.920 --> 08:40.720]  Here's the big picture.
[08:40.720 --> 08:46.680]  The United States is in a civil war against multinational corporations that have hijacked
[08:46.680 --> 08:52.320]  our federal government and many of our local and state governments who are now in a battle
[08:52.320 --> 08:58.680]  against President Trump, the American people, some state legislatures, cities and individuals
[08:58.680 --> 09:01.120]  for the future of this country.
[09:01.120 --> 09:02.960]  We have been conquered.
[09:02.960 --> 09:04.040]  We have been taken over.
[09:04.040 --> 09:08.720]  Just like 200 years ago, China was taken over by the colonial powers.
[09:08.720 --> 09:13.540]  Globalism is a full spectrum dominance takeover of every nation state on the planet.
[09:13.540 --> 09:17.880]  It uses poverty and debt to control populations.
[09:17.880 --> 09:24.480]  President Trump is trying to deliver prosperity and trying to return to nation state systems
[09:24.480 --> 09:28.120]  that give us security and sovereignty.
[09:28.120 --> 09:30.440]  He has delivered massively on the economy.
[09:30.440 --> 09:32.880]  He has delivered massively on security.
[09:32.880 --> 09:38.520]  He has delivered just amazingly when it comes to devastating political correctness and making
[09:38.520 --> 09:44.000]  it okay for people to speak up and have free speech and say no to the bullies.
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.920]  Because of that, the establishment that got caught lying during the election, that got
[09:48.920 --> 09:55.320]  caught putting out fake polls, that got caught trying to rig the debates, they have egg on
[09:55.320 --> 09:56.320]  their face.
[09:56.320 --> 10:03.360]  And instead of learning from their mistakes and just joining the republic, they have doubled
[10:03.360 --> 10:13.480]  down and they have decided to intensify the lies, the corruption and the deception.
[10:13.480 --> 10:16.520]  That's why Comey asked for a private meeting with Trump at Trump Tower.
[10:16.520 --> 10:18.240]  He gives it to him.
[10:18.240 --> 10:22.480]  Then Comey comes out and says it's outrageous they ever had a private meeting.
[10:22.480 --> 10:26.880]  That's why Comey says in two hearings, I was never asked to stop the Russia investigation.
[10:26.880 --> 10:30.680]  The media says that Comey never said that even though we played the video clips yesterday.
[10:30.680 --> 10:36.560]  I'm going to play them again today and then show you articles where they say I'm a liar.
[10:36.560 --> 10:43.600]  Trump's a liar, Donald Trump Jr.'s a liar, Jack Pasobic's a liar, everybody else is
[10:43.600 --> 10:46.040]  a liar.
[10:46.040 --> 10:47.040]  It's incredible.
[10:47.040 --> 10:49.360]  So it is a war on for your mind.
[10:49.360 --> 10:55.520]  They believe they can push so much hype that you believe Hillary Clinton's invincible and
[10:55.520 --> 10:56.840]  it's really the president.
[10:56.840 --> 11:01.040]  They believe they can push so much hype that you believe you didn't really vote for Trump.
[11:01.040 --> 11:03.120]  The Russians did.
[11:03.120 --> 11:08.560]  Oh my gosh, Trump may have some bots.
[11:08.560 --> 11:09.560]  What about the globalist?
[11:09.560 --> 11:10.560]  What about Facebook?
[11:10.560 --> 11:11.560]  What about Google?
[11:11.560 --> 11:16.680]  What about all the major infrastructure against President Trump throwing everything he can,
[11:16.680 --> 11:18.200]  everything they can against Trump?
[11:18.200 --> 11:19.280]  None of that's ever discussed.
[11:19.280 --> 11:22.640]  It's all one giant lie.
[11:22.640 --> 11:30.480]  And so it's a question of prosperity returning, common sense returning, true unity returning,
[11:30.480 --> 11:34.440]  never believing the globalist propaganda that's not even leftist.
[11:34.440 --> 11:39.600]  It's just weaponized media, pure deception, making the general public feel like they're
[11:39.600 --> 11:44.880]  being harmed, they're being abused, they're being screwed over, they're being cheated,
[11:44.880 --> 11:51.360]  they're being treated horribly by a racist versus the reality of what's happened.
[11:51.360 --> 12:00.440]  It's total and complete mind control and it's total and complete deception and it's nasty
[12:00.440 --> 12:08.000]  and it's vicious and it's hateful and it is calling for violence and death and destruction
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.960]  all over the United States.
[12:11.960 --> 12:21.480]  This weekend, communist and radical Muslims dressed up in garb in hammers and sickles
[12:21.480 --> 12:28.680]  and red crescents and body armor and helmets went out and threw urine and feces on men,
[12:28.680 --> 12:33.720]  women and children, they beat them with belly clubs, they attacked them, they savaged them
[12:33.720 --> 12:38.680]  and the state police in Austin, Texas at the Capitol would simply push people off of them
[12:38.680 --> 12:42.840]  when they would attack my reporters and families and press.
[12:42.840 --> 12:50.920]  We have hours and hours of footage on infowars.com of the most vile, hateful, vicious people
[12:50.920 --> 12:57.400]  attacking multiracial crowds of American flag-waving patriots.
[12:57.400 --> 13:05.480]  You look into the eyes of the most dumbed-down, most brainwashed, most servile, most helpless
[13:05.480 --> 13:13.480]  people you've ever seen and it makes your head spin and I would look into the eyes of
[13:13.480 --> 13:19.600]  the people on these videos screaming hateful things and hitting and attacking people and
[13:19.600 --> 13:25.480]  flipping the bird and they looked like people you've seen in documentaries where they show
[13:25.480 --> 13:32.680]  state hospitals, mental warts, crazed eyes, confused, hair sticking out, stumbling around
[13:32.680 --> 13:40.120]  like zombies with their shields, with their belly clubs, attacking and then not even getting
[13:40.120 --> 13:46.840]  in trouble when they assaulted police officers.
[13:46.840 --> 13:49.240]  It's amazing.
[13:49.240 --> 13:53.720]  I simply went and protested the fact that they were keeping the public out of the JFK
[13:53.720 --> 13:59.680]  memorial on the 40th anniversary a few years ago and the Democrat-controlled Sheriff's
[13:59.680 --> 14:04.880]  Department had the Sheriff's Department viciously attack men, women and children with belly
[14:04.880 --> 14:13.720]  clubs and run over us on video and we didn't fight back.
[14:13.720 --> 14:17.600]  And where was the media saying that was wrong to do that to us because we were simply there
[14:17.600 --> 14:19.440]  for free speech standing up?
[14:19.440 --> 14:24.280]  No, no, when the anti-fascists are beating and attacking people, fun about George Soros
[14:24.280 --> 14:31.800]  with the communists and when with the Muslims together, they would scream, stop stopping
[14:31.800 --> 14:40.680]  my free speech as they hit people with their clubs and where is the scandal?
[14:40.680 --> 14:47.560]  There is no scandal because MSNM is pushing kill Trump, kill Trump, kill Trump, kill his
[14:47.560 --> 14:52.440]  family, cut his head off everywhere.
[14:52.440 --> 14:56.440]  And dehumanizing those of us that are standing up for the country and cherry picking and
[14:56.440 --> 15:00.960]  picking and choosing things we've said and taking it out of context to then further demonize
[15:00.960 --> 15:06.480]  us to the public in an attempt to shut us up and bully us into submission and bully
[15:06.480 --> 15:12.040]  everyone else into submission, this is a form of warfare.
[15:12.040 --> 15:14.560]  And then enter, Megan Kelly.
[15:14.560 --> 15:23.000]  Then I'm going to talk about at the bottom of the hour, coming to town saying she's not
[15:23.000 --> 15:29.240]  doing a headpiece, pouring it on.
[15:29.240 --> 15:35.560]  It was completely fake and I knew it was fake and I thought it was intriguing to see how
[15:35.560 --> 15:41.720]  bad this headpiece would be and to just go into this lion's den, but I never thought
[15:41.720 --> 15:48.160]  they'd light my head from the side in classic villain lighting and shoot it up at my neck
[15:48.160 --> 15:51.600]  from beneath like you do a flashlight to scare kids.
[15:51.600 --> 15:58.200]  I mean, it was next level deception.
[15:58.200 --> 16:07.480]  And the good news is there might be tapes because I watched the promo, it's already highly
[16:07.480 --> 16:11.640]  edited to distort what I said.
[16:11.640 --> 16:17.720]  And if she wants to go down the Katie Kirk route, that's her issue and I don't care
[16:17.720 --> 16:19.040]  if they cancel the piece either.
[16:19.040 --> 16:25.920]  I wanted to just experience it and see Megan Kelly, you know, the fembot of Dr. Evil for
[16:25.920 --> 16:31.680]  myself and Chelsea Clinton blast Kelly for Alex Jones interview, give me a break, you
[16:31.680 --> 16:34.440]  two are two peas in a pod.
[16:34.440 --> 16:37.640]  Talk about an arts criminal, Chelsea Clinton in the WikiLeaks, knowing they're killing
[16:37.640 --> 16:43.680]  Asians, giving them cholera filled PCs water and thousands of them dying and stealing 97%
[16:43.680 --> 16:47.800]  of the money and you admit, you know, it's criminal and then you shake your finger at
[16:47.800 --> 16:54.320]  me because I'm a horrible liar talking about your mother and Jerry Epstein and Bill Clinton
[16:54.320 --> 17:01.040]  and Podesta and the emails and all the real stuff and Wiener and the convicted sex criminal.
[17:01.040 --> 17:03.400]  And so the media diverts off onto a pizza place.
[17:03.400 --> 17:07.560]  I'm the first person to say it's a diversion when we were reporting on other people's reports.
[17:07.560 --> 17:12.000]  We try to turn it around like I'm the progenitor of the pizza gate thing that's one pizza place
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.560]  and implied no pedophiles exist or that your father isn't up to his eyeballs, at least
[17:16.560 --> 17:23.000]  your stepfather and we know Webster Hubble's your daddy in all of the child molestation
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.880]  and your mother represents all these can pedophiles and child rapist when she was first a lawyer
[17:27.880 --> 17:29.360]  and made jokes about it.
[17:29.360 --> 17:35.840]  I mean, I love the fact you took the bait sweetheart.
[17:35.840 --> 17:41.040]  I know who you are, your mother, she came, she saw, he died, Lydia failed, hundreds of
[17:41.040 --> 17:45.040]  thousands died, serial, your ally with radical Islam.
[17:45.040 --> 17:47.800]  We know sweet heart.
[17:47.800 --> 17:49.800]  I want to be attacked by NBC.
[17:49.800 --> 17:51.400]  I want NBC to twist.
[17:51.400 --> 17:56.960]  I want them to lie because they're the enemy and that lets everybody know who the enemy
[17:56.960 --> 17:57.960]  is.
[17:57.960 --> 18:01.760]  I don't want the cowardly viewers that normally watch NBC.
[18:01.760 --> 18:06.440]  I want as a signal to everyone that we're not afraid of you and we're going to stand
[18:06.440 --> 18:14.160]  against you and we're going to expose you, but I don't care whether they are the stupid
[18:14.160 --> 18:15.160]  piece or not.
[18:15.160 --> 18:20.600]  As if I need to be on Megan Kelly show when it doesn't even have good ratings, six, seven
[18:20.600 --> 18:23.800]  million viewers, whoop-de-doo lady.
[18:23.800 --> 18:28.160]  We have videos every week that get five, six, seven, eight, 10, 20 million views.
[18:28.160 --> 18:30.760]  Paul Watson has them constantly.
[18:30.760 --> 18:35.320]  I've made films that have been downloaded over a hundred million times.
[18:35.320 --> 18:40.560]  Just one film, dum-dum, Obama Deception has been seen more than 50 million times just
[18:40.560 --> 18:44.000]  on two YouTube channels alone.
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.520]  You think, you think I need you?
[18:47.520 --> 18:49.800]  You think, you think you make me arrive?
[18:49.800 --> 18:52.280]  Oh, you cancel him.
[18:52.280 --> 18:54.360]  Don't show it.
[18:54.360 --> 18:55.920]  It's so horrible.
[18:55.920 --> 19:00.960]  That's all that get people to tune in that there's a controversy just like with the passion
[19:00.960 --> 19:01.960]  of the Christ.
[19:01.960 --> 19:03.960]  Oh, don't go see it.
[19:03.960 --> 19:06.600]  Don't go watch it.
[19:06.600 --> 19:12.920]  And then it makes it the biggest grossing film in history.
[19:12.920 --> 19:15.920]  Megan Kelly criticized for booking conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[19:15.920 --> 19:18.600]  She knows she needs us for the ratings.
[19:18.600 --> 19:22.640]  She needs my fame, the fame of liberty, your fame.
[19:22.640 --> 19:25.280]  They know we're the operating system of Trump.
[19:25.280 --> 19:27.760]  They know we're the reboot of 1776.
[19:27.760 --> 19:34.240]  They know you are the light in the dark of the night, and they don't like you.
[19:34.240 --> 19:37.400]  And so they want to make you think we're losing and we're failing just like they want to make
[19:37.400 --> 19:39.640]  you think Trump is losing and failing.
[19:39.640 --> 19:44.440]  It's all a bunch of hype, trillions in the stock market, hundreds of billions in new
[19:44.440 --> 19:49.400]  jobs, confidence way up, securing the border, all these great positive things happening
[19:49.400 --> 19:53.720]  with a bunch of whining little idiots running around bitching and complaining.
[19:53.720 --> 19:55.640]  It's a joke.
[19:55.640 --> 20:00.120]  We'll be back though with what Ivanka Trump had to say.
[20:00.120 --> 20:05.480]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[20:05.480 --> 20:09.560]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's

[21:00.720 --> 21:01.720]  That's my middle name.
[21:01.720 --> 21:07.840]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[21:07.840 --> 21:13.160]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[21:13.160 --> 21:14.160]  and high quality.

[21:20.360 --> 21:23.320]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[21:23.320 --> 21:27.800]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[21:27.800 --> 21:28.800]  It is an answer to prayer.
[21:28.800 --> 21:33.200]  And because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, Sinoferato ship, an additional

[21:58.880 --> 22:03.760]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former Congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[22:03.760 --> 22:08.120]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables
[22:08.120 --> 22:11.920]  that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[22:11.920 --> 22:14.920]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[22:14.920 --> 22:18.760]  Know you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?

[22:39.680 --> 22:41.000]  food on hand.

[23:34.680 --> 23:36.920]  The Oregon Police, remember her.

[23:40.840 --> 23:45.040]  The story of Tiffany Janks, a woman under mind control was murdered.
[23:45.040 --> 23:46.880]  Who really killed Tiffany Janks?
[23:46.880 --> 23:48.680]  A story that won't go away.

[23:55.600 --> 24:25.120]  Tiffany Janks, murder.com.
[24:26.600 --> 24:33.120]  Here's my message and I'm going to get into it more to Megyn Kelly, Chelsea Clinton and
[24:33.120 --> 24:40.120]  all these other seahags of the New World Order.
[24:40.120 --> 24:45.720]  I'm not trying to get out of this alive dumbasses.
[24:45.720 --> 24:49.720]  I'm not trying to get out of this a winner in your system.
[24:49.720 --> 24:52.800]  I'm here to bring you down.
[24:52.800 --> 24:58.320]  I'm here to make you pay for the wars and the lies and the corruption and the Clinton
[24:58.320 --> 25:01.720]  Foundation and all of it.
[25:01.720 --> 25:06.720]  That's why you keep missing the main calculation.
[25:06.720 --> 25:15.920]  I am a precision guided heavy munition coming in on top of you.
[25:15.920 --> 25:17.680]  I'm here to stand up for the innocence.
[25:17.680 --> 25:19.440]  I don't like you.
[25:19.440 --> 25:22.000]  I don't like you getting away with what you do.
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.840]  You make me sick.
[25:24.840 --> 25:29.640]  So I hit the bar boyer and everybody else comes in over me.
[25:29.640 --> 25:33.960]  Have you seen what we've done, how talk radio now sounds just like me?
[25:33.960 --> 25:36.240]  Have you seen how the president sounds just like me?
[25:36.240 --> 25:39.360]  Have you seen how Stephen Bannon sounds just like me?
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.280]  Have you seen how the whole paradigm globally shifting and you can't hold it back?
[25:44.280 --> 25:49.800]  You can destroy leaders, you can destroy me, but you can't stop the signal of Americana
[25:49.800 --> 25:59.400]  and all I did was bring back Americana Renaissance 2.0 selling that freedom, prosperity, technological
[25:59.400 --> 26:12.000]  development, honor, justice, family, God, will, strength, compassion, kinship, friendship,
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.400]  duty to your globalism a bunch of vampires that hate each other screwing everyone over
[26:18.400 --> 26:25.000]  trying to be the top yurtle the turtle on your power trips.
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.680]  My ego isn't big.
[26:26.680 --> 26:28.480]  My vision of humanity is big.
[26:28.480 --> 26:30.040]  My ego is in humanity.
[26:30.040 --> 26:31.360]  My ego is in the genetics.
[26:31.360 --> 26:37.520]  My ego is in my ancestors, my family, my children and my future progeny and yours together.
[26:37.520 --> 26:42.920]  I love humanity because I'm so selfish.
[26:42.920 --> 26:47.140]  I believe in it because I know it's me and it's you and us together.
[26:47.140 --> 26:48.960]  It sounds completely selfless.
[26:48.960 --> 26:57.200]  It's totally selfish and you have no idea because you don't know God.
[26:57.200 --> 26:59.160]  I'm protected fools.
[26:59.160 --> 27:00.920]  I'm talking to the evil ones.
[27:00.920 --> 27:05.520]  I will be around until God wants me gone and then no matter what happens, I know it's
[27:05.520 --> 27:06.520]  God's plan.
[27:06.520 --> 27:12.520]  So no matter what you do to me, I rejoice in it even though my flesh doesn't like it.
[27:12.520 --> 27:16.480]  My soul, my spirit loves it.
[27:16.480 --> 27:19.000]  I'm so alive, it's unbelievable.
[27:19.000 --> 27:25.000]  My discernment is so deep and piercing now, I can't even stand it.
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.980]  And I look at you, you fallen monsters, and I realize what jokes you are.
[27:29.980 --> 27:36.280]  And I thank God every millisecond at my cellular level that I am not with you and your damn
[27:36.280 --> 27:38.960]  the hell system.
[27:38.960 --> 27:39.960]  Praise God for that.
[27:39.960 --> 27:47.520]  I get to my message, I'm kind of doing it now, but I'm going to come back and really
[27:47.520 --> 27:52.520]  focus and do it because it's important because it's not this interview and it's not Megan
[27:52.520 --> 27:53.520]  Kelly.
[27:53.520 --> 27:54.600]  This is their big gamble.
[27:54.600 --> 27:56.640]  This is their big take Alex Jones down.
[27:56.640 --> 27:58.880]  This is pathetic.
[27:58.880 --> 28:06.280]  The only way I could fail was not doing it and letting them rig it and letting them interview
[28:06.280 --> 28:10.720]  me for four hours to edit it together.
[28:10.720 --> 28:18.960]  And then be able to show people what was really said.
[28:18.960 --> 28:26.280]  Walking right into a trap, even told them they were, but they think they're winners.
[28:26.280 --> 28:28.440]  They think they're invincible.
[28:28.440 --> 28:32.080]  They think as they hoard more money or can like try to put me down in the mud that they
[28:32.080 --> 28:33.080]  have a victory.
[28:33.080 --> 28:37.680]  They're busy shoving me down in the mud, everybody's overrunning them.
[28:37.680 --> 28:43.000]  And I'm making it safe for everybody else to speak out just like Trump's doing on a
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.240]  much bigger scale.
[28:44.240 --> 28:47.800]  And that's why they hate him and why they sell the hoax he's falling and why they sell
[28:47.800 --> 28:51.880]  the hoax that he's a criminal and why they sell the hoax and they've got the former lawyers
[28:51.880 --> 28:58.280]  that went after Enron, you know, in there.
[28:58.280 --> 29:00.400]  Trump's on an island all alone.
[29:00.400 --> 29:02.000]  You don't want to be with him.
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.740]  Be with the mainstream media, then you'll be with the winning team, even though the
[29:05.740 --> 29:10.200]  mainstream media wants you to lose, wants you poor, wants you under their control, represent
[29:10.200 --> 29:14.480]  the criminals, even though Trump actually wants to empower you and cut your taxes and
[29:14.480 --> 29:15.480]  bring the jobs back.
[29:15.480 --> 29:18.120]  No, no, no, you're a failure of your with Trump.
[29:18.120 --> 29:23.960]  Be a winner, join MSM.
[29:23.960 --> 29:27.160]  It is a total and complete test.

[29:44.560 --> 29:45.720]  them in this wave.

[33:01.240 --> 33:09.080]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones, who claims that
[33:09.080 --> 33:13.720]  9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[33:13.720 --> 33:21.560]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things
[33:21.560 --> 33:22.560]  like that.
[33:22.560 --> 33:32.560]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence
[33:32.560 --> 33:36.240]  voters in the election, and then they began to weaponize them.
[33:36.240 --> 33:45.400]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like info wars,
[33:45.400 --> 33:51.640]  take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can
[33:51.640 --> 33:52.640]  imagine.
[33:52.640 --> 33:54.880]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[33:54.880 --> 34:00.640]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let
[34:00.640 --> 34:03.920]  you down.
[34:03.920 --> 34:10.720]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[34:10.720 --> 34:18.040]  the info war.
[34:18.040 --> 34:22.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live again, thank you so much for joining us.
[34:22.520 --> 34:37.160]  I wouldn't normally even get into this, but it's important to do because it deals with
[34:37.160 --> 34:43.520]  the different ways that they're basically brainwashing the people so that it's an educational
[34:43.520 --> 34:46.200]  format to understand how the control works.
[34:46.200 --> 34:50.640]  That's why I spent like an hour of the two hour broadcast yesterday, just on the New
[34:50.640 --> 35:03.360]  York Times and Daily Beast articles that said, Comey never said that Trump did not ask him
[35:03.360 --> 35:05.360]  to stop the Russia investigation.
[35:05.360 --> 35:09.640]  And they said that I'm a liar, Jack Pasobix a liar, we're all liars, and then they said
[35:09.640 --> 35:16.880]  here's the fake text they tweeted and it's word for word, the hearing.
[35:16.880 --> 35:22.200]  Now ladies and gentlemen, that is next level lies.
[35:22.200 --> 35:23.200]  Now let's stop there.
[35:23.200 --> 35:27.960]  At the start of the next hour, in case you missed that, I'm going to play the hearing
[35:27.960 --> 35:32.800]  last Thursday on the eighth, and I'm going to play the hearing from the third of May
[35:32.800 --> 35:34.920]  where he says it twice.
[35:34.920 --> 35:37.920]  And then I'm going to show you the news articles again for radio listeners, I'll give you the
[35:37.920 --> 35:42.320]  headlines where you can read where they said it never happened.
[35:42.320 --> 35:48.400]  But you don't have to believe me or wait till next hour, just type in, Comey, Trump never
[35:48.400 --> 35:50.600]  ordered me to end Russia investigation.
[35:50.600 --> 35:55.720]  You'll get hundreds of mainstream news articles from the Associated Press to the London Independent.
[35:55.720 --> 36:00.400]  This is a fact.
[36:00.400 --> 36:04.640]  Just like they now say, there's nothing in the WikiLeaks about pedophilia, it's full
[36:04.640 --> 36:05.800]  of it.
[36:05.800 --> 36:10.760]  Then they use corrections about a pizza place not being involved to say pedophilia never
[36:10.760 --> 36:15.320]  existed, the Catholic Church isn't involved, none of it's happening.
[36:15.320 --> 36:18.240]  Nothing happened at Boys Town, nothing happened at Penn State.
[36:18.240 --> 36:21.520]  They didn't just indict the former head of the school for covering it up.
[36:21.520 --> 36:22.520]  Yes, they did.
[36:22.520 --> 36:25.520]  They didn't just indict Sandusky's son.
[36:25.520 --> 36:29.440]  Yes, they did.
[36:29.440 --> 36:31.280]  And that's why they're so desperate.
[36:31.280 --> 36:39.840]  The UN, we were there last year in Haiti, Michael Zimmerman, Joe Biggs, you name it.
[36:39.840 --> 36:47.400]  They were there, pulled them with Gary Haven, landed on grass runways and documented the
[36:47.400 --> 36:53.640]  UN kidnapping men, women and children and talked to locals and talked to senators.
[36:53.640 --> 36:58.800]  And then what came out six months later in Associated Press two-year investigation, but
[36:58.800 --> 37:00.600]  it got no coverage.
[37:00.600 --> 37:06.040]  Hundreds of children sex trafficked, hundreds killed, and guess who was involved as usual?
[37:06.040 --> 37:10.480]  The Clinton Foundation.
[37:10.480 --> 37:14.600]  You're watching us on TV, there's drone footage on the ground.
[37:14.600 --> 37:18.520]  We did multiple missions to Haiti, only Gary Haven back in studio, because he's the guy
[37:18.520 --> 37:20.640]  that spearheaded it and said it was going on.
[37:20.640 --> 37:24.920]  We've got the senator interviews, all of it saying it's incredible.
[37:24.920 --> 37:28.160]  They kept 97% of the money.
[37:28.160 --> 37:30.480]  Did the media attack this story?
[37:30.480 --> 37:34.160]  And that's what Megan Kelly did.
[37:34.160 --> 37:36.840]  So here's the Megan Kelly story.
[37:36.840 --> 37:48.720]  First off, let's go ahead and play the NBC one and a half minute promo that they're sending
[37:48.720 --> 37:53.400]  all over the internet right now for this next Sunday, Father's Day piece.
[37:53.400 --> 37:58.400]  And within minutes of this going out, they had the classic PR firms already ready.
[37:58.400 --> 38:08.240]  I saw this last night, when Kelly's tweet had zero retweets, Daria was already up here
[38:08.240 --> 38:16.760]  at night still working at the show, and she sent it to me instantly when it had zero retweets.
[38:16.760 --> 38:23.200]  And I was the first person to even retweet it.
[38:23.200 --> 38:33.080]  And as soon as I looked at it, I thought, oh my gosh, they lit my face from the side
[38:33.080 --> 38:39.840]  and under like you like somebody for a Halloween piece for a horror movie.
[38:39.840 --> 38:45.480]  And then I thought back over all the different things they did, just all the deception, all
[38:45.480 --> 38:47.360]  the lies, all of it.
[38:47.360 --> 38:48.520]  It's just incredible.
[38:48.520 --> 38:55.440]  And then within minutes, they run around and say, oh my gosh, boycott it.
[38:55.440 --> 38:56.440]  Don't air it.
[38:56.440 --> 38:58.640]  He's the worst person on earth.
[38:58.640 --> 39:03.960]  This is all a PR campaign.
[39:03.960 --> 39:07.160]  It is just massive.
[39:07.160 --> 39:09.840]  So they make it the ultimate evil is going to air.
[39:09.840 --> 39:10.840]  Don't tune in.
[39:10.840 --> 39:11.840]  Don't listen.
[39:11.840 --> 39:16.760]  Knowing that means everybody goes to her failed show, which has horrible ratings.
[39:16.760 --> 39:17.960]  And it's all a reboot.
[39:17.960 --> 39:22.840]  I'm supposed to reboot Megan Kelly and reboot Chelsea Clinton who's running around complaining
[39:22.840 --> 39:23.840]  and all of this.
[39:23.840 --> 39:27.680]  So I'll just say, you're right, Chelsea, your dad didn't fly around 20 plus times on
[39:27.680 --> 39:31.920]  the pedophile Alita Express course he did, and your mother didn't represent pedophiles
[39:31.920 --> 39:35.480]  and child rapists and make jokes about it later, who rape little girls so hard their
[39:35.480 --> 39:36.640]  insides came out of them.
[39:36.640 --> 39:37.640]  Of course she did.
[39:37.640 --> 39:41.280]  And your family didn't fund the Arab Spring and the radical Muslims taken over in nine
[39:41.280 --> 39:46.040]  different countries and killing over a million people, 200 plus thousand alone just in Syria.
[39:46.040 --> 39:47.720]  Oh, but she did.
[39:47.720 --> 39:52.080]  And they weren't involved in all these other crimes and the Clinton White House tripling
[39:52.080 --> 39:56.240]  the sanctions that Bush senior had on them and that those were bad enough to go from
[39:56.240 --> 40:03.240]  a couple hundred thousand kids dying over a few years to 500,000 children dying.
[40:03.240 --> 40:08.360]  And then your Secretary of State, Marilyn Albright went on 60 minutes and NBC CBS and
[40:08.360 --> 40:14.680]  NBC and said it's a good price to pay in the Gulf, 500,000 dead kids.
[40:14.680 --> 40:17.480]  No, you did all of that.
[40:17.480 --> 40:20.500]  And you did more than that.
[40:20.500 --> 40:27.160]  And you look at me who's never killed anybody.
[40:27.160 --> 40:37.520]  You come after me and the entire interview was unbelievable.
[40:37.520 --> 40:47.800]  It went on and on and on and on and on and on.
[40:47.800 --> 41:00.880]  Asking the same questions on Pizza Gate, Sandy Hook, Shabani yogurt, the bombing in Manchester.
[41:00.880 --> 41:03.280]  And when they didn't get the answer they wanted, they throw it out again and again and then
[41:03.280 --> 41:08.240]  she'd just sit there out of the blue and just say, I got your question.
[41:08.240 --> 41:12.560]  That wasn't even, I knew a response, anything I said, they just had notes she was going
[41:12.560 --> 41:17.000]  off of of how they were going to edit this together and she'd ask it over and over again.
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.880]  And some would say, why'd you do the interview then?
[41:18.880 --> 41:22.160]  Well, I turned most of them down because I knew in my gut, this was going to blow up
[41:22.160 --> 41:25.400]  in their face.
[41:25.400 --> 41:28.160]  And I knew in my gut, I wanted to see evil.
[41:28.160 --> 41:30.400]  I wanted to see sociopathic behavior.
[41:30.400 --> 41:32.120]  I wanted to see the fembot.
[41:32.120 --> 41:38.200]  I wanted to witness it for myself and watch the producer fawn a little sweet southern
[41:38.200 --> 41:39.200]  belly.
[41:39.200 --> 41:40.600]  I promise it's not going to be mean.
[41:40.600 --> 41:41.600]  It's a nice profile.
[41:41.600 --> 41:43.360]  You're famous now.
[41:43.360 --> 41:45.080]  And I'd say, no, no, it's not.
[41:45.080 --> 41:51.200]  It's going to be a hit piece off the talking points, my little darling.
[41:51.200 --> 41:54.480]  And then they got here and I said, okay, you got your big investigative report of the fake
[41:54.480 --> 41:58.200]  news king, you know, here, and this is how you're going to do it.
[41:58.200 --> 42:00.360]  And the first thing is, oh, look, it's all about money.
[42:00.360 --> 42:04.080]  And then the next thing, it's about this, the next thing, it's about that.
[42:04.080 --> 42:12.080]  And it was exactly what I thought it would be to a T.
[42:12.080 --> 42:14.080]  Think about that.
[42:14.080 --> 42:21.560]  And the PR and the, and the, and the push and all of it is just wild, absolutely wild.
[42:21.560 --> 42:26.800]  So let's go ahead and let's go to this clip preview.
[42:26.800 --> 42:32.240]  Megan Kelly interviews Alex Jones, and again, this is about getting me up there, making
[42:32.240 --> 42:36.520]  me look bad, making it look like I'm a failure, making it look like you don't want, you don't
[42:36.520 --> 42:37.880]  want to be associated with it.
[42:37.880 --> 42:40.840]  So under peer pressure, you run back to carbon taxes.
[42:40.840 --> 42:42.760]  You run back to a stagnant economy.
[42:42.760 --> 42:44.280]  You run back to open borders.
[42:44.280 --> 42:50.320]  You run back to George Soros and Muslim groups beating people up nationwide yesterday, stopping
[42:50.320 --> 42:55.280]  their anti-sharia law protests and everybody saying kill Trump and everybody saying, you
[42:55.280 --> 42:58.920]  know, don't wear American flags in public schools and don't hand out Christmas cards
[42:58.920 --> 43:03.000]  and pull down those crosses and let's teach your kids how to have abortions and let's
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.920]  teach your three year olds, you know, how to be a tranny at the public schools.
[43:06.920 --> 43:11.800]  Well, just let us run your lives or we're going to bully the hell out of you.
[43:11.800 --> 43:12.800]  You know what?
[43:12.800 --> 43:13.800]  I love it.
[43:13.800 --> 43:19.840]  Bully me, edit me, attack me because all you do is let everybody know you're the enemy
[43:19.840 --> 43:21.640]  and put the light underneath my face.
[43:21.640 --> 43:25.240]  I saw that when I came over and I thought, oh my gosh, they're lighting me from underneath
[43:25.240 --> 43:26.240]  underneath.
[43:26.240 --> 43:27.240]  Wow.
[43:27.240 --> 43:28.240]  This is going to be a hit piece.
[43:28.240 --> 43:30.120]  This is going to be the mother of it pieces.
[43:30.120 --> 43:32.880]  But I mean, they put horns on Trump everywhere.
[43:32.880 --> 43:33.880]  It's the same thing.
[43:33.880 --> 43:36.560]  It's ridiculous.
[43:36.560 --> 43:41.640]  And even if they destroy me down the road or Trump, it doesn't matter because nationalism
[43:41.640 --> 43:43.160]  is out.
[43:43.160 --> 43:44.560]  Globalism is being exposed.
[43:44.560 --> 43:47.720]  The tide, like Peter Till said, of globalism is going out.
[43:47.720 --> 43:49.000]  People know it's authoritarian.
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.280]  They know it's not elected.
[43:51.280 --> 43:58.120]  And then they released new photos yesterday of Alex Soros at a spirit cooking event at
[43:58.120 --> 44:02.480]  another event with bodies on stretchers, you know, and Satanist crap.
[44:02.480 --> 44:07.520]  And it's just like, there's no end to these people.
[44:07.520 --> 44:19.880]  There's no end to this plague of weirdos.
[44:19.880 --> 44:23.520]  It's all just a bunch of want to be trendies out there wanting to dominate.
[44:23.520 --> 44:28.720]  It's a bunch of weird power tripping betas that want to just absolutely run over everyone
[44:28.720 --> 44:32.840]  who want to dominate prosperity, dominate Christians.
[44:32.840 --> 44:36.360]  It's sickening.
[44:36.360 --> 44:37.360]  Judge has it.
[44:37.360 --> 44:42.360]  Soros' seed sprouts.
[44:42.360 --> 44:45.520]  New York Times stands by Trump assassination play.
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.360]  Time Warner still funding CNN host Hale's masterpiece.
[44:49.360 --> 44:57.280]  There you stab Trump to death.
[44:57.280 --> 45:01.400]  Because the Washington Post had an article out today saying, yeah, don't expect us to
[45:01.400 --> 45:02.400]  tell the truth.
[45:02.400 --> 45:03.400]  Trump, you're evil.
[45:03.400 --> 45:04.400]  We're going to lie about you.
[45:04.400 --> 45:05.400]  It's the same thing.
[45:05.400 --> 45:07.760]  Oh, Megan Kelly, tell me you're not doing a hit piece.
[45:07.760 --> 45:15.960]  Promise me that you're not going to do all those things, you know, again, and then come
[45:15.960 --> 45:25.800]  and lie about all of it because it's supposedly okay to have a mob of people like Julius Caesar
[45:25.800 --> 45:31.680]  in Shakespeare's play attacking the president and stabbing him to death in a big simulated
[45:31.680 --> 45:32.680]  killing.
[45:32.680 --> 45:36.320]  But that's okay because you're the people pushing your revolution.
[45:36.320 --> 45:38.840]  You're the people that had hijacked America.
[45:38.840 --> 45:42.800]  You're the people that were sexualizing young children in the public schools.
[45:42.800 --> 45:43.880]  You had dominated.
[45:43.880 --> 45:45.680]  You had taken the nation over.
[45:45.680 --> 45:47.720]  It was yours.
[45:47.720 --> 45:51.920]  And then we struggled back through your propaganda, through your lies, through your deception
[45:51.920 --> 45:55.200]  and said, no, we're not going to let you sexualize children.
[45:55.200 --> 45:57.200]  We're not going to let you have totally open borders.
[45:57.200 --> 45:59.440]  We're not going to let you bring in radical jihadis.
[45:59.440 --> 46:03.520]  We're not going to let you sit there and back ISIS killing Christians all over the world.
[46:03.520 --> 46:05.640]  We're not going to let you bankrupt the country.
[46:05.640 --> 46:08.120]  And they said, you better believe you're going to fail.
[46:08.120 --> 46:09.280]  We're going to bully you.
[46:09.280 --> 46:10.520]  We're going to attack you.
[46:10.520 --> 46:12.920]  We're going to simulate murdering you everywhere.
[46:12.920 --> 46:16.840]  And we're going to demonize you and we're going to have the press come to your family
[46:16.840 --> 46:21.100]  court hearings and lie about you and openly try to take your, you know, the children away
[46:21.100 --> 46:25.040]  from you and we're going to infiltrate your office and we're going to infiltrate your
[46:25.040 --> 46:28.640]  employees and we're going to have them go out and say horrible things about you.
[46:28.640 --> 46:29.640]  And we're good.
[46:29.640 --> 46:30.640]  I know your scum.
[46:30.640 --> 46:31.640]  I know your criminals.
[46:31.640 --> 46:32.840]  I know your trash.
[46:32.840 --> 46:33.960]  I know your filth.
[46:33.960 --> 46:35.320]  I expect it.
[46:35.320 --> 46:36.320]  Keep the bullying.
[46:36.320 --> 46:37.320]  Hit me with more.
[46:37.320 --> 46:38.320]  Come on.
[46:38.320 --> 46:39.320]  Come on.
[46:39.320 --> 46:40.320]  Let's go.
[46:40.320 --> 46:41.320]  Go ahead.
[46:41.320 --> 46:42.320]  Kill Trump.
[46:42.320 --> 46:43.920]  Let's see how far that gets you.
[46:43.920 --> 46:48.320]  I've studied history, but I can intellectually see it and I can spiritually feel it.
[46:48.320 --> 46:49.320]  You're failing.
[46:49.320 --> 46:50.320]  You're flailing.
[46:50.320 --> 46:55.720]  You're committing political suicide because you're a bunch of disgusting, power-tripping,
[46:55.720 --> 46:59.800]  demonic, worldly garbage.
[46:59.800 --> 47:01.360]  And you're going to fail.
[47:01.360 --> 47:08.480]  Yeah, let's play that clip before I play Megan Kelly of a clip of the play where they murder,
[47:08.480 --> 47:14.800]  or they murder President Trump, just like Kathy Griffin, you know, simulating the murder
[47:14.800 --> 47:15.800]  of the president.
[47:15.800 --> 47:19.760]  The idea is murder him, murder anybody that supports him.
[47:19.760 --> 47:26.080]  This is a group of ravenous, hateful demons who then turn around and say that we're hateful
[47:26.080 --> 47:30.600]  and they're trying to target the sheep, they're trying to target the weak-minded, they're
[47:30.600 --> 47:33.560]  trying to target them so they get scared and say, well, I better not speak up for what
[47:33.560 --> 47:34.560]  I believe in.
[47:34.560 --> 47:35.560]  I better roll over to this.
[47:35.560 --> 47:40.720]  I better go along with it because we're taking the country back and the scum is afraid.
[47:40.720 --> 47:41.720]  Here it is.
[47:41.720 --> 47:48.720]  It's an actor dressed to look just like President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
[47:48.720 --> 47:55.760]  Look as his character is stabbed to death and there's no mistaking the Trump connection.
[47:55.760 --> 48:00.280]  Check out the unbuttoned overcoat and red tie that hangs over his waist.
[48:00.280 --> 48:05.400]  It's a staging of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar that is outraging many.
[48:05.400 --> 48:10.240]  And it's done with American flags and Bush slash Trump, you know, up there presidential
[48:10.240 --> 48:11.400]  looking and this is happening.
[48:11.400 --> 48:14.600]  But let's go to the Megyn Kelly piece because I've been mentioning it.
[48:14.600 --> 48:17.560]  Again, edit it with light from the side and under me.
[48:17.560 --> 48:24.240]  Have you ever seen them interview anybody on national news with lights from below like
[48:24.240 --> 48:26.480]  you do with a flashlight to scare your kids?
[48:26.480 --> 48:28.720]  I mean, that's the level.
[48:28.720 --> 48:30.200]  This is what I look like.
[48:30.200 --> 48:31.880]  This is just normal lighting.
[48:31.880 --> 48:34.240]  If you're watching me right now on television.
[48:34.240 --> 48:36.600]  And then this is what I looked like a week ago.
[48:36.600 --> 48:37.600]  Here it is.
[48:37.600 --> 48:42.200]  This authoritarianism knows humanity's awakening and it's moving against humanity on a planetary
[48:42.200 --> 48:43.200]  scale.
[48:43.200 --> 48:47.320]  The great global battle for the future of our species is being fought right now.
[48:47.320 --> 48:49.840]  They call you the most paranoid man in America.
[48:49.840 --> 48:50.840]  Is that true?
[48:50.840 --> 48:51.840]  Absolutely not.
[48:51.840 --> 48:55.040]  A paranoid person will be hiding out in their house, not venturing out in public.
[48:55.040 --> 48:59.360]  I go out there on the street and battle Black Lives Matter, the communists to point blank
[48:59.360 --> 49:00.360]  range.
[49:00.360 --> 49:03.240]  We talked controversies and conspiracies.
[49:03.240 --> 49:04.240]  9-11.
[49:04.240 --> 49:08.040]  Now 9-11 was an inside job, but when I say inside job, it means criminal elements in
[49:08.040 --> 49:11.840]  our government working with Saudi Arabia and others wanted to frame Iraq for it.
[49:11.840 --> 49:12.840]  Just a fact.
[49:12.840 --> 49:13.840]  Sandy Hook.
[49:13.840 --> 49:17.360]  Sandy Hook's complex because I've had debates where we've devils advocates said the whole
[49:17.360 --> 49:18.360]  story is true.
[49:18.360 --> 49:22.200]  And then I've had debates where I've said that none of it's true.
[49:22.200 --> 49:28.360]  When you say parents faked their children's death, people get very angry.
[49:28.360 --> 49:29.360]  Well, that's all I know.
[49:29.360 --> 49:32.320]  But they don't get angry about the half million debt Iraq is from the sanctions or they don't
[49:32.320 --> 49:33.840]  get angry about all the illegal spending.
[49:33.840 --> 49:34.840]  That's a dodge.
[49:34.840 --> 49:35.840]  No, no, it's not a dodge.
[49:35.840 --> 49:38.720]  The media never covers all the evil wars it's promoted, all the big things.
[49:38.720 --> 49:41.320]  That doesn't excuse what you did and said about Newtown.
[49:41.320 --> 49:43.120]  Here's the difference.
[49:43.120 --> 49:48.880]  I looked at all the angles of Newtown and I made my statements long before the media
[49:48.880 --> 49:49.880]  even picked up on it.
[49:49.880 --> 49:51.680]  We didn't get any of the really important stuff.
[49:51.680 --> 49:52.680]  What do you mean?
[49:52.680 --> 49:53.880]  We talk about all the important stuff.
[49:53.880 --> 49:54.880]  Well, here's the big one.
[49:54.880 --> 49:55.880]  They always make fun of me.
[49:55.880 --> 49:56.880]  You probably want to throw this in there.
[49:56.880 --> 50:02.040]  30 years ago, they began creating animal human hybrids.
[50:02.040 --> 50:05.160]  That's the big story Megan Kelly should be doing.
[50:05.160 --> 50:12.520]  Now, anybody can search engine animal human hybrids gestating on U.S. farms and you'll
[50:12.520 --> 50:15.800]  get MIT just last year.
[50:15.800 --> 50:18.880]  Thousands of peer reviewed journals, reports, they don't roll them out.
[50:18.880 --> 50:22.760]  They don't show them to you because it's a no man's land.
[50:22.760 --> 50:24.320]  Animals have rights.
[50:24.320 --> 50:25.320]  Humans have rights.
[50:25.320 --> 50:26.720]  The hybrids have no rights.
[50:26.720 --> 50:27.720]  There it is.
[50:27.720 --> 50:29.240]  MIT technology review.
[50:29.240 --> 50:33.480]  Human animal chimeras are gestating on U.S. research farms.
[50:33.480 --> 50:34.880]  That's January 6th, 2016.
[50:34.880 --> 50:35.880]  A radical new approach.
[50:35.880 --> 50:37.640]  You know, it's 30 years old at least.
[50:37.640 --> 50:38.640]  That's BBC.
[50:38.640 --> 50:40.840]  But again, the same deal.
[50:40.840 --> 50:43.120]  Next they'll say, oh, he wants to herd animals.
[50:43.120 --> 50:44.520]  That would be the response, literally.
[50:44.520 --> 50:45.520]  I'm exposing it.
[50:45.520 --> 50:47.600]  I'm exposing Muslims blowing up Manchester.
[50:47.600 --> 50:49.920]  She said, why do you blame the Manchester victims?
[50:49.920 --> 50:53.520]  I said, I blame the Liberals that brought them in to bomb them and why do the Muslims
[50:53.520 --> 50:55.600]  keep targeting Liberals that are bringing them in?
[50:55.600 --> 50:57.600]  Yes, that's the big enchilada.
[50:57.600 --> 51:01.480]  That's the big elephant.
[51:01.480 --> 51:03.160]  I love sporting events.
[51:03.160 --> 51:04.880]  The atmosphere, the crowd.
[51:04.880 --> 51:09.720]  I even enjoy waiting in line because while I'm standing next to you, the RFID scanner
[51:09.720 --> 51:13.600]  in my pocket is capturing your personal information.
[51:13.600 --> 51:16.960]  From debit and credit cards, even your apartment building key.
[51:16.960 --> 51:22.720]  So you'll still be paying for this game long after it's over.
[51:22.720 --> 51:25.400]  Every two seconds, someone is a victim of identity fraud.
[51:25.400 --> 51:29.280]  This Father's Day, protect dad from crimes he can't see with ID stronghold wallets in
[51:29.280 --> 51:34.200]  all dad's favorite styles, Bible, triple, and even front pocket wallets and money clips.
[51:34.200 --> 51:37.960]  ID stronghold pioneered RFID blocking technology over 10 years ago.
[51:37.960 --> 51:41.960]  ID stronghold wallets look great and even cost about the same as wallets in most stores.
[51:41.960 --> 51:45.320]  I'm Wal Augustinowitz, founder and CEO of ID stronghold.
[51:45.320 --> 51:48.000]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID stronghold.
[51:48.000 --> 51:52.520]  For Father's Day, go to idstronghold.com and get a free mini wallet with purchase of any
[51:52.520 --> 51:59.040]  wallet order over $20.
[51:59.040 --> 52:03.400]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[52:03.400 --> 52:08.080]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[52:08.080 --> 52:09.600]  to detoxify the body.
[52:09.600 --> 52:14.440]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[52:14.440 --> 52:15.960]  It's made in the USA.
[52:15.960 --> 52:20.840]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[52:20.840 --> 52:22.680]  the body and it supports the infor.
[52:22.680 --> 52:24.920]  It is a classical 360 win.
[52:24.920 --> 52:29.400]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[52:29.400 --> 52:34.000]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.000]  get.
[52:35.000 --> 52:38.240]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[52:38.240 --> 52:43.240]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[52:43.240 --> 52:48.440]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[52:48.440 --> 52:52.280]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[52:52.280 --> 52:53.280]  prayers together.
[52:53.280 --> 52:54.280]  We're changing the world.
[52:54.280 --> 52:58.720]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and FullWarsLife.com.
[52:58.720 --> 53:03.200]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the
[53:03.200 --> 53:05.440]  best for you and your family.

[54:05.720 --> 54:07.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[54:07.120 --> 54:08.840]  Dr. Corsi is joining us the next hour.
[54:08.840 --> 54:09.840]  Time for other news.
[54:09.840 --> 54:11.440]  I'm going to open the phones up.
[54:11.440 --> 54:13.680]  InfoWars.com is the new site.
[54:13.680 --> 54:17.680]  It's an active rebellion and resistance for the globalist to spread that link to everybody
[54:17.680 --> 54:22.040]  you know every day at the grocery store, at the bank teller, to your friends, your neighbors,
[54:22.040 --> 54:29.000]  your family, call in to talk radio, c-span, info wars.com, and it is an active resistance.
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  But Megan Kelly ratings her sinking.
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.320]  Her ratings were sinking at Fox.
[54:34.320 --> 54:37.080]  She destroyed herself going after Trump.
[54:37.080 --> 54:41.360]  And so they think having Mr. Controversy on, because I get top ratings anytime on a
[54:41.360 --> 54:44.920]  national TV, they think that will boost her.
[54:44.920 --> 54:48.560]  Here's Morgan's highest ratings ever were when I was on.
[54:48.560 --> 54:54.280]  But even Megan told me privately, or she thought privately, that oh, I destroyed him.
[54:54.280 --> 55:01.160]  Because after I was on his program, his ratings started dropping every day consecutively.
[55:01.160 --> 55:03.360]  Because we just called these folks out.
[55:03.360 --> 55:06.880]  And so Megan Kelly's playing with fire obviously.
[55:06.880 --> 55:08.720]  And nothing can save her show.
[55:08.720 --> 55:10.320]  Nothing can save Main Street Media.
[55:10.320 --> 55:12.360]  Main Street Media has abysmally low ratings.
[55:12.360 --> 55:16.120]  They've gone up a little bit attacking Trump because it makes media interesting again.
[55:16.120 --> 55:19.360]  But compared to 10 years ago, they're a shadow of the former self.
[55:19.360 --> 55:22.160]  You know, I went into the Gorgons' lair.
[55:22.160 --> 55:25.440]  I went into Medusa's palace.
[55:25.440 --> 55:28.480]  And I engaged her on her terms.
[55:28.480 --> 55:30.640]  I let her be here from 9.30 in the morning.
[55:30.640 --> 55:33.840]  She got here at noon, but her crew at 9.30 until almost 11 at night.
[55:33.840 --> 55:37.240]  I let her have her way because I knew it'd be rigged.
[55:37.240 --> 55:38.400]  I knew she was lying to me.
[55:38.400 --> 55:39.400]  I knew she was deceiving.
[55:39.400 --> 55:41.520]  I knew it was a giant hit piece.
[55:41.520 --> 55:45.200]  But they wanted me to go happily along with it and say nothing before it aired.
[55:45.200 --> 55:46.760]  I'm not going to do that.
[55:46.760 --> 55:51.720]  But understand, I win by going into the Gorgons' pit.
[55:51.720 --> 55:54.640]  And I survive.
[55:54.640 --> 55:56.880]  I survive going into that lair.
[55:56.880 --> 55:57.880]  And that's what it's all about.
[55:57.880 --> 56:03.880]  In fact, she hid over there in the dark.
[56:03.880 --> 56:06.880]  She hid over there in the dark when she first got here.
[56:06.880 --> 56:09.360]  Slythering in like the Gorgon.
[56:09.360 --> 56:16.480]  Let's play some of that with audio of her coming into the studio last week.
[56:16.480 --> 56:17.680]  The radio listener.
[56:17.680 --> 56:21.360]  This is Megyn Kelly entering the studio.
[56:21.360 --> 56:23.080]  I dare not look directly at her.
[56:23.080 --> 56:27.360]  I looked at her on monitors on the wall with cameras aimed at her.
[56:27.360 --> 56:34.160]  And she had her arrows and she tried like she could to take me out.
[56:34.160 --> 56:42.160]  She's a keen, keen, bold woman.
[56:42.160 --> 56:55.000]  That doesn't feel good.
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  Cold as ice.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  A titan against a titan.
[56:59.000 --> 57:05.360]  See, to get to the globalist, I've got to get the Gorgon's head and then I could turn
[57:05.360 --> 57:13.840]  to the titan, Thoros, and look into the Gorgon's eyes, look into it yourself.
[57:13.840 --> 57:22.920]  I face the Gorgon.
[57:22.920 --> 57:25.920]  Megyn Kelly in studio.
[57:25.920 --> 57:30.000]  It is true when she was in studio, she was like back there in the dark.
[57:30.000 --> 57:40.200]  Well, we know how it all ends, ladies and gentlemen, but alas, that's part two coming
[57:40.200 --> 57:41.200]  up.
[57:41.200 --> 57:45.760]  Now, before I go any further, just briefly, we're listener, supporter, runner, major globalist
[57:45.760 --> 57:46.760]  attack.
[57:46.760 --> 57:48.760]  We make it easy to support us.
[57:48.760 --> 57:53.000]  We have very high quality products at infowarstore.com, which the enemy hates that we're self-funded,
[57:53.000 --> 57:54.000]  so they can't take our sponsors.

[58:20.720 --> 58:24.160]  pack, 25% off.

[58:38.560 --> 58:39.560]  organic, made in America.
[58:39.560 --> 58:40.560]  We are listening to GCN.
[58:40.560 --> 58:41.560]  Hour number two, straight up.
[58:41.560 --> 58:42.560]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:42.560 --> 58:49.560]  Over the weekend, as we're listening to GCN Live, we're listening to GCN Live.
[58:49.560 --> 58:54.880]  Over the weekend, Act for America held human rights marches across the United States, marching
[58:54.880 --> 58:59.240]  against Sharia law, which prohibits certain human rights to women, and countries where
[58:59.240 --> 59:01.760]  Sharia law is in practice, oppress women.
[59:01.760 --> 59:05.920]  So leave it to Antifa to show up and disrupt these Americans' First Amendment right, but
[59:05.920 --> 59:07.360]  it didn't stop there.
[59:07.360 --> 59:11.280]  Journalists like myself got assaulted and cursed at just for documenting the event.
[59:11.280 --> 59:16.240]  Lauren Southern even had animal urine thrown at him, while filming in the New York City
[59:16.240 --> 59:17.520]  march against Sharia.
[59:17.520 --> 59:20.120]  If it wasn't obvious before, it is now.
[59:20.120 --> 59:22.640]  CNN and Antifa are ISIS.
[59:22.640 --> 59:26.680]  Leftist freaked out when a burqa was put on Fearless Girl in New York City, faced with
[59:26.680 --> 59:29.360]  the imagery of the oppression they were supporting.
[59:29.360 --> 59:33.560]  The same people that are now supporting Sharia law in America were the same people who were
[59:33.560 --> 59:38.040]  so helplessly offended by Donald Trump's grab her by the private comment.
[59:38.040 --> 59:42.840]  So Trump's inappropriate private conversation is unacceptable, but forced female genital
[59:42.840 --> 59:44.600]  mutilation is okay.
[59:44.600 --> 59:47.000]  The left has literally lost their minds.
[59:47.000 --> 59:51.720]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[59:51.720 --> 1:00:02.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:02.440 --> 1:00:04.240]  We are on the march.
[1:00:04.240 --> 1:00:07.240]  The empire is on the run.
[1:00:07.240 --> 1:00:11.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:00:11.240 --> 1:00:13.240]  We live in on it.
[1:00:13.240 --> 1:00:18.000]  You know, it's fair game if Megan Kelly wants to interview me for four hours and then edit
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.160]  it down to a few minutes and make it look like I'm a fumbling, bumbling idiot with a
[1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:25.280]  light underneath my chin, like something out of a horror movie, you know, you do like under
[1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:29.840]  the blanket when you're a kid to scare yourself or scare others.
[1:00:29.840 --> 1:00:30.840]  That's what they did.
[1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:32.760]  I mean, this is next level baloney.
[1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:36.120]  So yeah, I'm going to have some fun with this then.
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:37.960]  I'm going to have a lot of fun with it.
[1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:41.760]  We're going to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour and then at the start of the next
[1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:45.760]  hour, Roger Stone's got big breaking news about the Comey investigation and Mueller and what
[1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:47.200]  they're beefing up to try to do to Trump.
[1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:48.200]  It's pretty serious.
[1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:50.640]  So that should make the globalist happy, but Trump will defeat it.
[1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:53.720]  He's done nothing wrong, but it's going to be hardcore.
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:59.440]  And then of course, we're going to have Owen Troyer and Rob Dew, who went out to the communist
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:05.560]  George Soros, anti free speech, Muslim March, where the Muslims and communists teamed up
[1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:09.360]  to attack men, women and children and run around screaming incoherently.
[1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:16.680]  I don't know what language it was, it sounded like Spanish, but it was mainly not even Hispanics
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:17.680]  out there.
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:20.440]  It was a bunch of people that looked like they'd escaped from the state mental hospital.
[1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:21.920]  And I'm not kidding when I say that.
[1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:27.080]  I mean, if I saw this group normally, I'd say, is that a state mental hospital, trustee,
[1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:29.800]  visit, you know, to the planetarium or something?
[1:01:29.800 --> 1:01:32.760]  I mean, something's wrong with these people.
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:37.960]  And that's what's scary about leftists is they claim they're all intellectual and they're
[1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:39.680]  really great and they're awesome.
[1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:40.680]  They're not.
[1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:44.200]  They're a bunch of drooling, peeling, miscreant, malcontent, boobies.
[1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:49.760]  Now, before I go any further, that's not profane to say boobies.
[1:01:49.760 --> 1:01:55.480]  Boobies is a South China Sea multi-thousand-year-old name for pirates.
[1:01:55.480 --> 1:01:58.600]  That's what they had the term booby trap.
[1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:03.880]  The boobies also would set traps that would pop up like we do in Vietnam, the spikes and
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:05.000]  kill you.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:09.440]  There's no FCC problems with me saying boobies.
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:12.560]  Knowledge is not a conspiracy theory.
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:15.880]  All you that think you're so-called intellectuals that are liberals need to understand you're
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:17.320]  not intellectuals.
[1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:19.640]  You're imagining you're part of a winning team.
[1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:21.920]  You're imagining you're part of the globalist system.
[1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:23.960]  You're imagining you conquered America.
[1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:27.640]  You're imagining how you're going to teach those three-year-olds, you know, how to perform
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:28.640]  sex acts on you.
[1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:30.400]  That's what they teach in public schools now.
[1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:33.720]  And you're just not going to get away with it.
[1:02:33.720 --> 1:02:43.040]  Everyone now knows you're a bunch of lobotomized, warped, crazy people that are in your own
[1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:49.560]  fantasy land that wealth produced, that all of this wealth that freedom produced created
[1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:55.120]  a bunch of super-spoiled brats, the seventh brat of the seventh brat.
[1:02:55.120 --> 1:03:00.000]  And now you're just running around foaming at the mouth, your gleeful behavior, and it's
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:01.120]  not going to work forever.
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:02.360]  It's coming down.
[1:03:02.360 --> 1:03:06.000]  Here's the big news coming up, though, with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:10.080]  Video emerges of Seth Rich questioning ballot integrity.
[1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:12.200]  I'm sure that's a conspiracy theory video, too.
[1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:14.000]  In fact, he wasn't even shot in the back.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  It's all made up.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:16.400]  Respect the family.
[1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:17.640]  Stop hurting the family.
[1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:18.640]  Go to sleep.
[1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:19.960]  Don't question mass shootings.
[1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:20.960]  Don't question anything.
[1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:26.880]  And then we've also got Ivanka Trump on Fox and Friends.
[1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:28.280]  Did not expect this level of viciousness.
[1:03:28.280 --> 1:03:30.680]  It's all up on infowars.com.
[1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:33.360]  That is coming up.
[1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:41.560]  We have a loving religion of priests, mall-off cocktail attack, again, religion of peace.
[1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:45.520]  So that's just some of what we're going to be breaking down, new North Korea information.
[1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:50.760]  North Korea, not far away from test-firing intercontinental ballistic missile, but Trump's
[1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:51.840]  bad if he stands up to them.
[1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:56.440]  He should be like the Clintons and give them nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors and delivery
[1:03:56.440 --> 1:04:00.800]  systems like they gave North Korea and the Communist Chinese, and then Chelsea Clinton,
[1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:05.880]  when she's not robbing Haitians or other folks in the Money Laundering Clinton Foundation
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:07.080]  that's committed all these crimes.
[1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:11.320]  There's no special prosecutor, no investigation of just admitted criminal servers, admitted
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:13.600]  massive criminal fraud everywhere.
[1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:15.800]  It's all Donald Trump.
[1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:21.280]  Chelsea Clinton, Blast Kelly, Megan Kelly for Alex Jones interview.
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:23.480]  How could you talk to such a liar?
[1:04:23.480 --> 1:04:28.400]  Well, how they talk to someone that tells the truth is, edit everything I say by asking
[1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:30.720]  the same questions over and over again.
[1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:33.800]  And I realized at a certain point, I should have just said, no, I've already answered
[1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:34.800]  your question.
[1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:35.800]  Let's move on.
[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:37.800]  But they didn't use that too and just said I didn't answer the question.
[1:04:37.800 --> 1:04:42.400]  But I just went in there, openly did the interview, which they're now making a big national story.
[1:04:42.400 --> 1:04:46.600]  Because they're trying to prop up Megan Kelly while claiming that they're against Megan
[1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:47.600]  Kelly.
[1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:48.600]  Yeah.
[1:04:48.600 --> 1:04:49.600]  Then find, cancel it.
[1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:51.960]  Maybe I should agree with, I agree with Chelsea.
[1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:55.840]  I'm so horrible, Megan, don't air your piece.
[1:04:55.840 --> 1:05:00.360]  We'll be back.
[1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:02.480]  The collapse of the left continues.
[1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:06.160]  If it isn't Maxine Waters or Nancy Pelosi having a mental breakdown.
[1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:09.360]  If it isn't Snoop Doggity Dogg pretending to shoot President Trump.
[1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:14.040]  If it isn't Kathy Griffin going full Isis and depicting herself with a decapitated Trump
[1:05:14.040 --> 1:05:15.040]  hat.
[1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:18.480]  It's the New York Public Theater depicting the assassination of President Trump in their
[1:05:18.480 --> 1:05:20.880]  latest installment of Shakespeare in the Park.
[1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:25.480]  The play depicted President Trump as the modern day Julius Caesar, this time being stabbed
[1:05:25.480 --> 1:05:29.120]  to death by minorities and women, a clear subliminal message.
[1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:35.400]  Leave it to CNN to endorse such an atrocity as Fareed Zakaria said the play is a masterpiece.
[1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:39.840]  But the disturbing presentation did not go without consequences as major sponsors of
[1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:44.560]  the theater have now pulled their sponsorship dollars, such as Delta Airlines and Bank of
[1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:49.040]  America, who have supported the theater to the tunes of millions in the past.
[1:05:49.040 --> 1:05:51.360]  The suicide of the left is real.
[1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:59.240]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[1:05:59.240 --> 1:06:03.720]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying
[1:06:03.720 --> 1:06:08.360]  what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[1:06:08.360 --> 1:06:12.400]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:16.760]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[1:06:16.760 --> 1:06:22.080]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[1:06:22.080 --> 1:06:28.480]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at Infowarslife.com.

[1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:30.200]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:35.640]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is joining us and I'm going to open the phones up at the bottom of the
[1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:36.640]  hour.
[1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:40.480]  Roger Stone is popping in with big news and then we've got two of our reporters that
[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:46.680]  were in downtown Austin for the anti-fascist, which is communists and Muslims.
[1:08:46.680 --> 1:08:52.200]  They were wearing helmets with red crescents on them and helmets with hammers and sickles
[1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:56.800]  on them and they were beating up men, women and children and then the state police and
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:01.280]  riot gear, we have like hours of this footage, we're going to play some of it coming up
[1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:06.720]  at the end of the third hour, attacking people and hitting them and the police would only
[1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:11.480]  come over and stop them, I guess there were a few arrests, I mean they should be hitting
[1:09:11.480 --> 1:09:13.560]  them over the head.
[1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:17.960]  There's video of them with clubs and helmets running into police when the police are doing
[1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:22.760]  nothing and they put up with it because their liberals, their communists, their Muslims,
[1:09:22.760 --> 1:09:27.600]  you know, they've only killed hundreds of millions of people, each group, 140 million
[1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:32.400]  Hindus murdered by Muslims alone, hundreds of millions killed by communists, so because
[1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:36.880]  they're part of groups that have killed far more than Hitler, they're loving and liberal
[1:09:36.880 --> 1:09:41.680]  and they've got to be protected and then they would scream, this is what a police state
[1:09:41.680 --> 1:09:47.840]  looks like, don't violate my free speech while they were attacking men, women and children.
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:52.960]  These videos are all up on infowars.com, but I've asked Owen, I've asked Du, 20 to Bigger
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:56.760]  Crew, they went out, they shot the videos, it's all raw, I said you've got to boil this
[1:09:56.760 --> 1:10:03.320]  down to like 10 minutes because I watched hours of it Saturday, hours of it and then
[1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:08.280]  yesterday I watched hours of it and my kids are like hey, why don't you take us on a hike
[1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:12.880]  or something to the Greenbelt and I'm like watching it on my iPhone, so we're going
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:17.080]  to boil this down, it happened all over the country, beating up women, throwing feces
[1:10:17.080 --> 1:10:23.720]  on people, attacking police and it's on the news, yay, yay, the Liberals went out against
[1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:30.520]  the racist anti-Sharia law march, Sharia law says cut women's genitals off, put hoods
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:35.160]  over their heads, throw gays off buildings, chop people's arms and legs off, if a woman
[1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:40.200]  gets raped, then she goes to prison and the left is defending and everywhere, the U.S.
[1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:47.360]  said today and others say the sign of feminism is the Hajib and I guess the Hitler's the
[1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:53.840]  sign of Jewish rights or something, no, it's the antithesis, it's the opposite, it's insane,
[1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:59.320]  it's out of control, it's crazy and it shows how nuts the left is, now they've got big
[1:10:59.320 --> 1:11:03.760]  hit plays in New York that Time Warner and all the rest of these people are involved
[1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:09.280]  in that they won't disassociate themselves from, we can put up the Drudge headline right
[1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:14.800]  now at drudgereport.com where they show them killing Trump, New York Times stands behind
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:21.520]  Trump assassination play, Time Warner still funding CNN host Hales masterpiece, this is
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:26.280]  a week after Kathy Griff and you know, chop his head off, they want the revolution, they're
[1:11:26.280 --> 1:11:31.760]  the violent bullies, they're the scum, just like Ivanka Trunk, Trump has come out and
[1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:36.320]  said to Fox and Friends, this level of viciousness we're going to play at the moment in D.C.
[1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:44.160]  is unprecedented, these are bullies desperate to whip up a civil war in America, it shows
[1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:51.360]  what brazen, sickening, reprobate, dangerous criminals they are, a clear and present danger
[1:11:51.360 --> 1:11:56.200]  and then I'll talk to Dr. Corsi about this, Megan Kelly comes to town, I know it's going
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:11:59.680]  to be a hit piece but I've never had someone lie to me and say I promise it's a profile
[1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:06.760]  you're big, I just did Putin, even that big exclusive couldn't get her ratings up and
[1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:11.200]  then it was the most vicious cross examination asking the same questions over and over again
[1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:16.960]  over four hours, that's why I do that, I agreed it was a profile, it's not a profile, it's
[1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:22.040]  an investigative piece with a light under my chin so I look like a monster but I walked
[1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:28.240]  into the lion's den because we're going to be able to then expose how they edited it,
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:33.800]  how they manipulated it and how they deceived the American people, they're a joke and people
[1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:37.320]  know not to trust the media, so people that don't know who I am, they're going to come
[1:12:37.320 --> 1:12:41.800]  to infowars.com and they're going to find out, people in the office are making the joke,
[1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:46.960]  they're like who is that guy, we don't recognize him, he gained a hundred pounds, they had
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:50.600]  to have stretched the video, we've got video experts looking at it now, I mean I don't
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:56.800]  care, I'm not a vain person but I mean, haha, teeny jet eye, I mean did Jabba the Hutt get
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:59.360]  interviewed by this lady?
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:04.960]  It's amazing, so that's coming up, also Seth Rich, new video, the guy that got shot in
[1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:08.920]  the back, we're not supposed to investigate, we're just supposed to shut up and not get
[1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:15.520]  into that, well here it is ladies and gentlemen, video emerges of Seth Rich questioning ballot
[1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:20.560]  integrity, as we already knew he was doing behind the scenes according to our sources,
[1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:27.600]  only confirming more, right now let's go to infowars.com D.C. Bureau Chief as he sets
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:33.360]  that up, Dr. Jerome Corsi, Doc what a time to be alive, oh it's an incredible time to
[1:13:33.360 --> 1:13:38.560]  be alive, Alex and you know you've said that this is the whole point of the info wars,
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:44.960]  we're in an information war, it's a government and they mainstream media designed to put
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:51.720]  out disinformation, to create disinformation and the Megan Kelly which is obviously going
[1:13:51.720 --> 1:13:57.960]  to be a hit job is not going to persuade any of the people who listen to info wars and
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:03.200]  are dedicated followers of you in the program, it's going to be obvious that this is just
[1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:12.400]  another leftist attempt with mainstream media to silence info wars and to discredit info
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:18.120]  wars as a news organization and it'll fail, it'll be transparent and those who have followed
[1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:23.720]  info wars for years will not be persuaded by Megan Kelly's lighting or her theatrics.
[1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:28.680]  They're clearly getting desperate, they're upping the calls for violence, where do you
[1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:30.960]  see this going Dr. Corsi?
[1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:37.240]  Well I think it's clearly an out, out, out war, I mean it's the reason we're dedicated
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:42.920]  to expanding the Washington Bureau where I think we'll put into place a program over
[1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:50.880]  the next bit of time to have info wars be able to compete with the Fox News of the world,
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:55.400]  the internet live streaming is the future and this is just the beginning I think of
[1:14:55.400 --> 1:15:01.080]  an information revolution in which the American people are just going to no longer be spoon
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:10.240]  fed, the CIA paid for mainstream media leftist propaganda, I mean it's a shock to realize
[1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:16.520]  that the mainstream media under since Operation Mockingbird in the 1950s, some of the most
[1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:23.520]  senior people, most respected people including Robert Novak, including Joseph Alsap were
[1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:30.520]  on the CIA payroll, were regarded as the sources that the Warren Commission could be reported
[1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:34.720]  to because the government knew they could lie in the New York Times and the Washington
[1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:36.440]  Post will cover for them.
[1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:40.800]  We're facing the same thing with Megan Kelly, now she's gone to NBC, she's gotten a bigger
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:48.160]  megaphone, she's gotten a bigger sponsorship from the deep state and she's about to do
[1:15:48.160 --> 1:15:53.800]  her hatch of jobs which I think are going to ultimately fail and we will continue to
[1:15:53.800 --> 1:15:57.680]  beat by reaching the people directly through the internet.
[1:15:57.680 --> 1:16:03.320]  How can Jeff Bezos, one of the top Obama globalist backers, one of the top Hillary backers get
[1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:08.080]  600 million from the CIA, the leftist at the top of it, we know there's some good people
[1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:13.160]  in there, to put out stuff in the Washington Post where the Washington Post writes articles
[1:16:13.160 --> 1:16:19.360]  admitting we're lying about Trump because he's bad, they've gotten so immoral that they've
[1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:24.280]  had articles in the New York Times, the Washington Post, in fact guys I forgot to do this, you
[1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:29.120]  grabbed me yesterday's stack with the New York Times and all those articles where they're
[1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:35.160]  saying that FBI director never said under oath that Trump did not tell him to stop an
[1:16:35.160 --> 1:16:40.960]  investigation, he did twice but they're writing articles Dr. Corsi saying we're liars that
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:46.680]  never happened, that is next level, there's the headline, a pro-Trump conspiracy theorist,
[1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:52.000]  a false tweet and a runaway story, they then show the text and say he made it up, we have
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:17:00.080]  the video May 3rd and we have the June 8th of the Senator Burr and the same answer, this
[1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:01.880]  is next level.
[1:17:01.880 --> 1:17:06.720]  Well, I think the Washington Post actually ran an article this weekend saying that they
[1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:11.840]  don't have to be fair and balanced, that they can decide that President Trump is an illegitimate
[1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:17.400]  president, so it's there now as a duty to do everything they can to destroy the presidency.
[1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:23.320]  I mean this is a complete bias that has been in our media for 50 years.
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:29.400]  Exactly, so why are they declaring we'll lie, I mean this is, how are they doing this?
[1:17:29.400 --> 1:17:35.960]  Well I think first of all the mainstream media is getting cornered because InfoWars, others
[1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:44.080]  are exposing daily the hypocrisy, the moral vacuousness of the left and showing how they
[1:17:44.080 --> 1:17:52.400]  will lie, they will go to any extreme to destroy you, Alex, me, anyone who dares oppose them.
[1:17:52.400 --> 1:17:56.800]  I mean you know, they go to the extent of killing people and Seth Richmurder definitely
[1:17:56.800 --> 1:18:02.280]  needs to be investigated and the mainstream media gives it no attention whatsoever, it's
[1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:09.400]  a controlled, politicized, every bit as much as Providence was under the Soviet Union.
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:14.400]  Our intelligence agencies have developed the techniques of propaganda and this is a propaganda
[1:18:14.400 --> 1:18:21.200]  attack disinformation against President Trump and it won't stop till President Trump decides
[1:18:21.200 --> 1:18:26.400]  and knows he's got the power of the presidency and he begins a counterattack which puts the
[1:18:26.400 --> 1:18:34.400]  mainstream media, Comey and others under investigation, does take steps like pardon Flynn and then
[1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:40.520]  there's no investigation that could mean anything and a special prosecutor on the Russian collusion
[1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:45.960]  which will not stop even though there's no evidence for it because we're not dealing
[1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:52.400]  with news, we're dealing with propaganda, Megyn Kelly is a disinformation artist.
[1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:55.880]  And we're about to go to break and we're going to come back and play these clips.
[1:18:55.880 --> 1:19:02.640]  We have Senator Burr last week, we have a hearing in May 3rd, the same thing, Comey
[1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:07.560]  saying no one told me to stop an investigation, including President Trump by name.
[1:19:07.560 --> 1:19:14.120]  Then they run a news article on Saturday titled a pro-Trump conspiracy theorist, a false tweet
[1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:19.320]  and a runaway story by Jeremy Peters and then they ran other articles as well saying I'm
[1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:27.880]  a liar, you're a liar, Jack Basovic's a liar, everybody's a liar and then you can verify
[1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:32.440]  this is real, I don't see how they think they'll get away with it.
[1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:37.160]  That is like delusional level deception but folks, we're going to play these clips for
[1:19:37.160 --> 1:19:44.600]  you but also here's the key, a lot of mainstream media isn't lying, AP, London Independent and
[1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:49.320]  a bunch of others ran the headline, Comey, Trump never told me to stop an investigation.
[1:19:49.320 --> 1:19:54.160]  So not all of the mainstream media is lying, it's the Washington Post, the New York Times,
[1:19:54.160 --> 1:20:01.440]  CNN, MSNBC, they are total liars.
[1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:06.920]  I love sporting events, the atmosphere, the crowd, I even enjoy waiting in line because

[1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:06.880]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[1:21:06.880 --> 1:21:12.200]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[1:21:12.200 --> 1:21:13.200]  and high quality.

[1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:32.120]  out the studio number and not the GCN number.
[1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:37.560]  So we're going to do that coming up, I guess, at the start of the next segment, or we can
[1:24:37.560 --> 1:24:40.840]  do a deal where you guys bring me the number and hanging in there on the wall, the new
[1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:44.080]  number I'm supposed to give out, that'd be great, or maybe, maybe type it up there for
[1:24:44.080 --> 1:24:45.080]  me.
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:50.600]  A lot of little production, things like that to keep ourselves busy with, so as soon as
[1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:54.920]  I see that number typed up there, I will give you that number.
[1:24:54.920 --> 1:25:02.800]  It's 877-789-ALAX, 877-789-ALEX, because we're taking the calls in here in our own studio
[1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:11.160]  system today, 877-789-ALAX is the number we're producing the whole show in-house here today,
[1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:17.080]  not through the great folks up at GCN, 877-789-ALAX.
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:18.080]  So that's coming up.
[1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:22.120]  Look at these little headlines I just ran into, then we'll get into the clips I was
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:23.120]  just mentioning.
[1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:30.320]  CNN's Fareed Zarkaria hails Trump assassination play as a masterpiece.
[1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:37.120]  That's up on infowars.com, talk about CNN being a terrorist organization, also a report
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:42.120]  Trump gives previous 4th of July deadline to clean up the White House, Clifford Cunningham,
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:45.520]  infowars.com.
[1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:52.560]  Coming back to Dr. Corsi, why do you think they're pushing so much violence?
[1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:54.200]  What is the point of that?
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:59.800]  Well, the left has gotten to a point of desperation.
[1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:07.640]  The Trump victory was completely unanticipated, unexpected, as the gaining of influence of
[1:26:07.640 --> 1:26:15.600]  the, what they call the alternate media, I mean the internet media, infowars already rivals
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:19.680]  Fox in terms of its viewership.
[1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:24.760]  And people are not depending on the mainstream media to get their news any longer.
[1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:31.120]  If it weren't for Bezos and the Washington Post or Carlos Slim and his millions, New
[1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:36.360]  York Times would have closed a long time ago, because their influence is waning.
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:40.320]  And so as they see they're losing, they're getting more desperate.
[1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:46.720]  I mean Soros, the CIA, and by the way, the CIA needs to be reamed out and cleaned.
[1:26:46.720 --> 1:26:55.000]  I mean, John Brennan, who was Muslim, complete operator in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood,
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:03.120]  anti-American, both the CIA and the FBI, as well as the IRS and the EPA have been packed
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:04.760]  with leftist operators.
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:09.800]  Well, it's like this winner lady that changed her name to Reality Winner, who was trying
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:14.440]  to join the Taliban, hated all whites, even though she was white, calling for white genocide.
[1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:16.560]  She was put with the top security clearance in.
[1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:21.400]  This is the type of lunatics that the SJWs in control have basically packed into the
[1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:22.400]  government.
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:23.520]  God help us.
[1:27:23.520 --> 1:27:27.440]  And they think that they're completely legitimate in leaking information.
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:33.240]  I mean, James Comey leaking, and he admitted it on the witness stand, was shocking.
[1:27:33.240 --> 1:27:39.600]  I mean, here is the FBI director trying to move the news and leaking information about
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:42.120]  a private conversation with the president.
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:44.720]  This is beyond the pale.
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:51.840]  I mean, the Comey and his operatives, including Mueller, need to be fired and dismissed.
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:53.440]  This is totally illegal.
[1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:58.640]  This is, and of course, he also leaked fake info, let the media put out lies that he
[1:27:58.640 --> 1:28:01.960]  was ordered to obstruct justice, then under oath admitted it wasn't the case.
[1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:03.120]  So it was fraud.
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:06.280]  It wasn't just an illegal leak, it was fraud.
[1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:12.920]  And the key that we're fighting a disinformation propaganda campaign here is that it's proceeding
[1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:20.840]  on this Russia meme or meme without any evidence, admittedly with no evidence.
[1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:25.880]  So where there's abundant evidence to go after the Clinton Foundation, to go after the Clinton
[1:28:25.880 --> 1:28:31.760]  emails, now after Comey's testimony to investigate Loretta Lynch, none of that happens.
[1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:40.120]  And the mainstream media is in lockstep with the CIA funding backing people who are disinformation
[1:28:40.120 --> 1:28:41.720]  artists like this Megan Kelly.
[1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:47.200]  And by the way, it's admitted that they legalized under Obama four years ago, the CIA engaged
[1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:48.200]  in domestic propaganda.
[1:28:48.200 --> 1:28:55.640]  And it's admitted that they are ordered hit pieces against info wars, against trudge,
[1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:56.640]  against President Trump.
[1:28:56.640 --> 1:28:59.520]  I mean, we are literally in a war.
[1:28:59.520 --> 1:29:04.640]  And a war in which the government is manipulating the, it's an info war.
[1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:07.840]  It's exactly why we're at the center of this.
[1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:13.840]  Because it's the government implementing a deception of the reality that you're perceiving.
[1:29:13.840 --> 1:29:19.440]  In other words, no proof that Trump interfered or colluded with the Russians, well, therefore
[1:29:19.440 --> 1:29:21.360]  it proves it's true.
[1:29:21.360 --> 1:29:22.720]  And you're supposed to believe that.
[1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:29.040]  It's supposed to be the, Joseph Garibald's repeating a lie often enough that it becomes
[1:29:29.040 --> 1:29:30.640]  the reality.
[1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:35.520]  And the information disinformation artists like this Megan Kelly are out there to do
[1:29:35.520 --> 1:29:36.520]  hit jobs.
[1:29:36.520 --> 1:29:37.520]  That's right.
[1:29:37.520 --> 1:29:38.520]  And she's failing.
[1:29:38.520 --> 1:29:39.520]  I mean, it's failed.
[1:29:39.520 --> 1:29:40.520]  Megan Kelly should be the hashtag.
[1:29:40.520 --> 1:29:44.640]  And of course, Facebook and all them are involved exploiting, trying to stop us.
[1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:46.480]  But oh, Trump gets his own few bots.
[1:29:46.480 --> 1:29:47.480]  He's evil.
[1:29:47.480 --> 1:29:48.680]  We're going to be right back to play those clubs.
[1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:49.680]  We're on the march.
[1:29:49.680 --> 1:29:50.680]  What do you recall?
[1:29:50.680 --> 1:30:00.800]  This is on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:00.800 --> 1:30:04.680]  The reason info wars life has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want
[1:30:04.680 --> 1:30:06.120]  products I'm going to use for my family.
[1:30:06.120 --> 1:30:10.560]  I take this, my family takes this, and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore

[1:30:21.680 --> 1:30:22.880]  I don't feel good.
[1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:26.520]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[1:30:26.520 --> 1:30:29.280]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female.
[1:30:29.280 --> 1:30:35.360]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[1:30:35.360 --> 1:30:37.520]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.

[1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:34.960]  I've got to play these clips I mentioned because we catch the New York Times.
[1:33:34.960 --> 1:33:39.920]  Daily Beast, all of them, just outrageous lies, Alex Jones lied to his viewers and said
[1:33:39.920 --> 1:33:44.080]  that Comey said no one tried to tell him to stop the investigation.
[1:33:44.080 --> 1:33:47.200]  And we had three clips of that last Thursday.
[1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:54.080]  We have other clips and they just say we're liars and show the actual quotes but don't
[1:33:54.080 --> 1:33:55.080]  link to where we said it.
[1:33:55.080 --> 1:34:01.200]  And then at the bottom of the story, knowing nobody reads that, they go, well, the reason
[1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:04.800]  we're saying they're lying is it was May 3rd.
[1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:10.520]  But they were talking about a February memo, February 18th, where he said that the president
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:11.920]  did try to influence him.
[1:34:11.920 --> 1:34:16.400]  And we said so he's either lying on May 3rd or he's lying in the memo.
[1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:19.280]  So now he says the memo didn't say that.
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:24.440]  But he let the media run with that for months.
[1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:29.080]  It's so frustrating to then be called a conspiracy theorist because I have a memory.
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:31.840]  It's like I'm cursed with this memory.
[1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:38.640]  Becca, Sam, O'Brien, Morgan, Jennifer, Tom, John, Steven, all of you, your calls are coming
[1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:42.800]  up with Dr. Corsi here in a few minutes just briefly.
[1:34:42.800 --> 1:34:45.160]  To say we're under attack is an understatement.
[1:34:45.160 --> 1:34:47.000]  We've never had more viewers.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:49.360]  We've never been more successful.
[1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:52.720]  We are bringing in the same amount of revenue we were bringing in last year despite the
[1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:56.400]  fact that they've been trying to take our sponsors and kick us off Google ads and things
[1:34:56.400 --> 1:34:57.400]  like that.
[1:34:57.400 --> 1:35:00.960]  But despite all that, you have come through purchasing products.
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:03.680]  We found some other advertising systems that work better than Google.
[1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:06.680]  I'm going to be telling you about that soon just because it's so cool and it's been so
[1:35:06.680 --> 1:35:09.760]  successful and they're not censoring us.
[1:35:09.760 --> 1:35:12.040]  So one door closes, other doors open.
[1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:15.520]  But it is so essential that if you need a high-quality gravity-fed filter for your
[1:35:15.520 --> 1:35:20.360]  shower or your bathtub, we go out and find the very, very best at the very best prices.
[1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:24.680]  We have five different brands of gravity-fed stainless steel filters that are apples and
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:25.680]  oranges.
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:26.680]  Some are better than this.
[1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:27.680]  Some are better than that.
[1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:32.080]  They all remove stuff down to almost undetectable or undetectable levels depending on what
[1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:33.080]  the compound is.
[1:35:33.080 --> 1:35:37.120]  There's thousands of different things in the average tap water and average well water.
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:41.840]  You are crazy if you're not filtering your water with a system that actually cuts this
[1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:42.840]  out.
[1:35:42.840 --> 1:35:44.680]  Now reverse osmosis cuts out the minerals.
[1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:45.680]  These systems don't.
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:52.760]  So whether it's Pure or Alexa Pure, they blow away all the other gravity-fed filters out
[1:35:52.760 --> 1:35:54.600]  there or I'd be carrying 20 brands.
[1:35:54.600 --> 1:35:55.600]  They are the best.
[1:35:55.600 --> 1:35:57.440]  Alexa Pure and Pro Pure.
[1:35:57.440 --> 1:36:00.680]  Side by side, some are better than this, some are better than that.
[1:36:00.680 --> 1:36:03.240]  But I use both of these in my personal life.
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:07.440]  We have some other great systems, some three-stage filters and systems.
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:11.760]  But by purchasing that there, you can read all the great reviews, you make the broadcast
[1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:12.760]  possible.
[1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:16.880]  Now we have to end the special on one of our most popular products, and that's Super
[1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:19.080]  Blue.
[1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:23.280]  Made in America, high quality, private labeled at the biggest organic facility in the country
[1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:24.480]  that makes Toms of Maine.
[1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:29.560]  The folks that make it for us make it for Toms of Maine, we add the iodine, the colloidal
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:32.720]  silver with the tea tree oil with the peppermint.
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:38.840]  It's a big tube, it's concentrated 4.8 stars, 1,400 plus reviews on power reviews, that's
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:41.160]  third-party, major site.
[1:36:41.160 --> 1:36:43.320]  It's amazing and it funds our operation.
[1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:46.080]  You get 10% off additional when you sign up for auto-ship.
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:48.360]  That way you don't have to forget and run out of toothpaste.
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:53.800]  We have a combo deal with the 10 to 1 organic mouthwash, where it's 10 to 1 concentrated
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:59.520]  for the same bottle, same amount of money as a regular bottle of mouthwash.
[1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:05.040]  Most essentials is 25% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:11.000]  So take advantage of that, you can cancel any time, triple A, 2, 5, 3, 3, 1, 3, 9.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:18.320]  Also, we have a new shipment of Biotrus selenium that is back in, and Biotrus selenium goes
[1:37:18.320 --> 1:37:24.080]  like a horse in carriage with the survival shield X2 deep earth iodine, the good halogen.
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:27.920]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about how most iodine is bound so you don't
[1:37:27.920 --> 1:37:28.920]  absorb it.
[1:37:28.920 --> 1:37:32.760]  Learn why it has an unbelievable 4.9 reviews.
[1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:38.440]  Nobody's got that on third-party sites, because it's so powerful.
[1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:44.400]  Survival shield with the Biotrus selenium, massively discounted 25% off infowarstore.com
[1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:49.400]  or triple A, 2, 5, 3, 3, 1, 3, 9 and funding us as we expand.
[1:37:49.400 --> 1:37:52.440]  I love the globalists and their operatives here in Austin.
[1:37:52.440 --> 1:37:53.440]  That's a whole other subject.
[1:37:53.440 --> 1:37:58.440]  I mean, they have got whisper teams, media people contacting my crew, saying we're going
[1:37:58.440 --> 1:38:02.080]  under, saying we're going to fall, then the very media calls me and goes, I hear you're
[1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:03.080]  going under.
[1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:06.160]  We're building a half-million-dollar studio next to me.
[1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:08.840]  We are trying to hire three new crews.
[1:38:08.840 --> 1:38:11.880]  We just gave everybody raises because our listeners are supporting us.
[1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:17.520]  It's total lies, rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated to quote Mark Twain, and
[1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:20.240]  a lie goes halfway around the world where the truth puts its pants on.
[1:38:20.240 --> 1:38:25.400]  You know, they say on this promo, the fast-talking Texan, I'm not fast-talking in person.
[1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:28.480]  I've got your calls, tons of news, so much info.
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:32.080]  I get sped up because I'm agitated.
[1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:34.680]  I mean, you don't get agitated by their lies.
[1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:38.720]  You don't get agitated by them saying Trump's going to fall any minute to create that perception
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:41.840]  when all he's trying to do is cut our taxes and restore the Republic.
[1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:45.720]  You don't get agitated by these people playing psychological warfare games that want them
[1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:46.720]  to fail.
[1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:51.400]  You don't get agitated by this headline, a pro-Trump conspiracy theory, a false tweet
[1:38:51.400 --> 1:38:58.600]  and a runaway story, and then it shows the tweet of Jack Posovic, and it's a quote from
[1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:04.440]  the May 3rd hearing, and they tell you it's totally fake till the end of the long article,
[1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:08.880]  no hardly anybody reads it and says, well, the deception is it's an old, old, old time,
[1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:09.880]  he said this.
[1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:10.880]  He didn't say Trump by name.
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:13.200]  Really, Thursday, he said Trump by name three times.
[1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:18.240]  They're still in the news saying, Comey did not say Trump never tried to order him or
[1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:19.240]  influence him.
[1:39:19.240 --> 1:39:23.440]  Yes, he did say that, but I'm going to put all that aside.
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:26.640]  I'm going to play the clips because this isn't just my opinion.
[1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:32.600]  Other MSM told the truth and said that Comey said he was never ordered to do that.
[1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:35.000]  I'm going to play that clip first.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:41.600]  Right now, here is Senator Burr, one of three times last Thursday on national television
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:48.040]  where he said that Trump never ordered him to do that, just exactly as Trump said, and
[1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:51.360]  he admitted he told him he wasn't under investigation for Russia.
[1:39:51.360 --> 1:39:53.480]  Something else the media said never happened.
[1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:56.320]  I mean, folks, they think you're morons.
[1:39:56.320 --> 1:40:00.360]  They think you're idiots, and I'm betting and Trump's betting you're not.
[1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:01.360]  Here's the clip.
[1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:09.560]  Director Comey, did the president at any time ask you to stop the FBI investigation into
[1:40:09.560 --> 1:40:12.920]  Russian involvement in the 2016 US elections?
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:14.800]  Not to my understanding, no.
[1:40:14.800 --> 1:40:20.160]  Did any individual working for this administration, including the Justice Department, ask you
[1:40:20.160 --> 1:40:22.800]  to stop the Russian investigation?
[1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:23.800]  No.
[1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:26.480]  Director, when the president-
[1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:28.320]  And then he goes on from there.
[1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:29.320]  He says it repeatedly.
[1:40:29.320 --> 1:40:31.440]  Again, that's not imaginary.
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:36.000]  That's cough and nails of their lies to the Washington Post, the New York Times, who admits
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.480]  they're lying to you for your own good.
[1:40:38.480 --> 1:40:40.200]  Every week they're at editorial saying they're lying.
[1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:42.280]  I mean, who can do that?
[1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:43.280]  I studied Russia.
[1:40:43.280 --> 1:40:44.760]  I studied North Korean stuff.
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:45.760]  They never.
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:47.480]  Only North Korea lies like this.
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:48.480]  Okay?
[1:40:48.480 --> 1:40:50.800]  I mean, these lies are cuckoo level.
[1:40:50.800 --> 1:40:57.520]  Here is the May 3rd hearing where he says nobody, not just the Justice Department, nobody
[1:40:57.520 --> 1:40:59.160]  would do that because that's a big deal.
[1:40:59.160 --> 1:41:00.160]  Here it is.
[1:41:00.160 --> 1:41:05.080]  So, if the attorney general or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:09.520]  investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:13.280]  In theory, yes.
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:15.120]  Has it happened?
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:20.000]  Not in my experience because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.280]  that without appropriate purpose.
[1:41:22.280 --> 1:41:26.720]  I mean, we're oftentimes, they give us opinions that we don't see a case there and so you
[1:41:26.720 --> 1:41:28.840]  ought to stop investing resources in it.
[1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:32.160]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political
[1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:33.160]  reason.
[1:41:33.160 --> 1:41:34.160]  That would be a very big deal.
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:36.240]  It's not happened in my experience.
[1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:37.240]  Not happened in my experience.
[1:41:37.240 --> 1:41:38.240]  Okay.
[1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:39.240]  It would be a big deal.
[1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:40.640]  Now, let me show you the New York Times again.
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:41.640]  This is Saturday.
[1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:46.520]  A pro-Trump conspiracy theorist, a false tweet and a runaway story.
[1:41:46.520 --> 1:41:50.960]  They dehumanized Pyssobic, who was high-level Trump campaigner and one of the biggest groups,
[1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:51.960]  very successful.
[1:41:51.960 --> 1:41:52.960]  He's not a human.
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:54.320]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:56.200]  Here is what they say is fake.
[1:41:56.200 --> 1:42:00.920]  Comey, not in my experience because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing
[1:42:00.920 --> 1:42:02.680]  something that without an appropriate purpose.
[1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:08.120]  I mean, we're oftentimes, they give us opinions that we don't see a case there and so you
[1:42:08.120 --> 1:42:10.240]  ought to stop investigating resources in it.
[1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:13.520]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for political
[1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:14.520]  reasons.
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:15.520]  That would be a very big deal.
[1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:16.520]  It's not happened in my experience.
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:18.240]  You read this article.
[1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:20.440]  It says that that is a fake quote.
[1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:22.440]  You mean to read the whole article to go in there?
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:23.600]  Go read it for yourself.
[1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:26.360]  They think you have lobotomies, people.
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:27.360]  Corsi.
[1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:30.720]  Again, Dr. Corsi, what do you make of this?
[1:42:30.720 --> 1:42:32.440]  It's typical.
[1:42:32.440 --> 1:42:38.920]  The mainstream media is, again, not out to report truth, not out to be responsible to
[1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:46.440]  any standard of veracity, their propaganda agency, and that when we produce the truth,
[1:42:46.440 --> 1:42:50.440]  their job is to discredit us, to say, no, that's not true.
[1:42:50.440 --> 1:42:51.440]  That didn't happen.
[1:42:51.440 --> 1:42:56.160]  Now, they are not required under any standard of the mainstream media to prove that what
[1:42:56.160 --> 1:42:59.560]  they say is true, and they don't.
[1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:06.880]  This entire Russian meme, the entire attack that Comey leveled, is intended to be a deep
[1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:11.240]  state coup d'etat to impeach President Trump.
[1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:15.880]  Until President Trump begins to really understand how Washington works, the Democrats will spend
[1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:20.440]  the entire first year talking about Russia with no evidence.
[1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:26.840]  And the mainstream media will attack anyone who points this out and says and cites truth
[1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:28.120]  as we do.
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:33.840]  We are now targeted by the mainstream media and the deep state CIA and other agencies
[1:43:33.840 --> 1:43:37.520]  funding the mainstream media are for extinction.
[1:43:37.520 --> 1:43:39.960]  Well by the way, you're not stupid and you've worked for the State Department and worked
[1:43:39.960 --> 1:43:41.200]  in Glandestan areas.
[1:43:41.200 --> 1:43:42.200]  I'm not stupid.
[1:43:42.200 --> 1:43:44.680]  I have high-level CIA sources that are good people, so do you.
[1:43:44.680 --> 1:43:47.160]  I mean, hell, we talked to the President.
[1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:52.400]  But I'm telling you, Megan Kelly and that crew she had were total analysts, total operatives.
[1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:57.560]  I mean, it was like a CIA substation, Ford Foundation substation, when they had that
[1:43:57.560 --> 1:43:58.560]  rented house over there.
[1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:03.440]  I mean, it was like a whole crew of professors, basically, and they are so freaked out that
[1:44:03.440 --> 1:44:04.840]  they can't break our will.
[1:44:04.840 --> 1:44:05.840]  They cannot defeat us.
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:08.800]  I mean, do they understand we're destroying them right now, of course?
[1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:10.400]  Well, that's the whole point.
[1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:11.400]  They're desperate.
[1:44:11.400 --> 1:44:13.000]  But look at what Megan Kelly did.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:14.800]  First of all, she picked the setting.
[1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:16.000]  Then she picked the lighting.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.720]  Her lighting on her is designed to make her look great.
[1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:21.880]  The lighting on you is made to make you look terrible.
[1:44:21.880 --> 1:44:25.160]  Then they put you through an interrogation where your first answer isn't good enough.
[1:44:25.160 --> 1:44:27.160]  Your second answer isn't good enough.
[1:44:27.160 --> 1:44:32.200]  And hard-hitting questions where she's looking like she's really boring in for the truth and
[1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:34.040]  you're on the stand.
[1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:35.040]  You're defending yourself.
[1:44:35.040 --> 1:44:36.040]  You must be guilty.
[1:44:36.040 --> 1:44:39.560]  I mean, Hitler couldn't have produced a better show trial.
[1:44:39.560 --> 1:44:41.600]  This is all propaganda.
[1:44:41.600 --> 1:44:43.760]  This is not news.
[1:44:43.760 --> 1:44:44.760]  These are techniques.
[1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:50.800]  These are techniques that are used to discredit Alex Jones and discredit InfoWars.
[1:44:50.800 --> 1:44:55.200]  And they won't work because our audience sees past it.
[1:44:55.200 --> 1:45:00.480]  That's why InfoWars and the Internet are so desperately threatening to the control of
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:06.520]  the mainstream media as the CIA has had since Operation Mockingbird was exposed in the 1950s.
[1:45:06.520 --> 1:45:10.320]  I mean, everybody knows you light one half of somebody's face and from the bottom.
[1:45:10.320 --> 1:45:12.320]  That's called Halloween lighting.
[1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:13.320]  Exactly.
[1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:17.720]  I mean, there's 10 techniques she used.
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:22.000]  First of all, the repeated questioning on the same issue.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:25.640]  Well, the communists have been doing that in interrogation of POWs.
[1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:27.440]  We've documented it since Korea.
[1:45:27.440 --> 1:45:30.360]  Then the selective picking of answers.
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:33.440]  He's not going to represent any one of your answers in his entirety.
[1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:37.880]  She'll pick this piece from this answer, that piece from this answer, string them together
[1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:41.280]  so it looks like you're incriminating yourself.
[1:45:41.280 --> 1:45:46.480]  Then she's going to ask questions that are, you know, have you quit beating your wife-type
[1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:47.480]  questions?
[1:45:47.480 --> 1:45:52.800]  You know, how about the poor victims, the mothers who've lost children in Sandy Hawking?
[1:45:52.800 --> 1:45:54.920]  You know, how can you say it?
[1:45:54.920 --> 1:45:56.200]  Why would you believe?
[1:45:56.200 --> 1:45:58.400]  And isn't it outrageous that you think?
[1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:02.640]  Oh, she would even like cut away after we've been talking and just say some gotcha line
[1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:07.040]  again, clearly as a cutaway, and then they mix it all together deceptively, where we're
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:08.280]  clearly in the promo.
[1:46:08.280 --> 1:46:13.400]  I'm answering questions to other things she's asked to make it look like I can't answer.
[1:46:13.400 --> 1:46:17.080]  And also, you know, look, she starts out, she comes in and she's all sweet and lovely.
[1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:18.880]  Oh, we just really want a nice interview.
[1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:20.600]  We're going to be fair to you.
[1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:21.800]  This is featuring you.
[1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:26.800]  You'll be on national television and, you know, but then once the camera goes on, now
[1:46:26.800 --> 1:46:28.960]  she turns into Barracuda.
[1:46:28.960 --> 1:46:32.520]  Now she turns into doing what a real job is, which is hatchet man.
[1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:34.400]  And of course, I knew she was lying.
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:36.960]  The point is she is a liar.
[1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:38.040]  That's the whole point.
[1:46:38.040 --> 1:46:44.160]  It's a disinformation attack is designed to reframe the reality.
[1:46:44.160 --> 1:46:52.520]  So people see you as, you know, this nutcase in Texas, who's off on a, you know, completely
[1:46:52.520 --> 1:46:58.280]  insane accusations, when in fact is the truth is that what the mainstream media is doing
[1:46:58.280 --> 1:47:02.280]  is they're coming up their lies and they've done it consistently.
[1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:07.120]  It's why I'm so intent on even new information coming out of the Kennedy assassination, it's
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:08.520]  where they started.
[1:47:08.520 --> 1:47:15.960]  I've got memos from within the, within the Johnson administration, where the entire intent
[1:47:15.960 --> 1:47:20.800]  was to pay journalists like the New York Times and the Washington Post to support the Warren
[1:47:20.800 --> 1:47:24.960]  report and to hand it out to the Warren report as a friendly audience.
[1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:31.480]  It was all a strategy defined within the disinformation machine of the deep state.
[1:47:31.480 --> 1:47:33.200]  And that's what we're challenging.
[1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:38.280]  That's what we want people to wake up for from this, you know, mesmerizing dream where
[1:47:38.280 --> 1:47:41.120]  the Democratic party is out to save you.
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:42.120]  They're out for the poor.
[1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:44.480]  Well, Hillary Clinton is in doubt for the poor.
[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:49.920]  Hillary Clinton is out to make herself billions of dollars cheating, stealing and not getting
[1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:55.160]  prosecuted for it with a mainstream media that will demonize anyone who dares to point
[1:47:55.160 --> 1:47:56.160]  it out.
[1:47:56.160 --> 1:47:59.000]  Well, let me tell you, she's one of the coldest people I've ever been around.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:02.560]  Let's play this Seth Rich clip and the guy that got gunned down in the back.
[1:48:02.560 --> 1:48:03.560]  Here's the video.
[1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:06.880]  They don't want you to see of him questioning ballot integrity, dealing with them stealing
[1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:08.640]  the election from Bernie Sanders.
[1:48:08.640 --> 1:48:09.640]  Here it is.
[1:48:09.640 --> 1:48:12.760]  Excuse me, Seth Rich with the DNC.
[1:48:12.760 --> 1:48:18.320]  I think so whoever you've spoken about provisional ballots and rejected ballots, I guess we've
[1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:24.600]  looked at as an outside practitioner with a vested interest in training our voters.
[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:28.640]  How do we get better access to data that tells us why ballots are rejected?
[1:48:28.640 --> 1:48:32.960]  Why ballots are cast as provisional so that we can analyze that and then develop better
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:34.960]  training guides?
[1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:38.440]  Can one of the election officials speak to any work you've done with either the parties
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:40.680]  or other groups on that type of information?
[1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:45.240]  Again, that's the video that's emerged of Seth Rich questioning ballot integrity, a video
[1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:48.920]  of a service that murdered Democratic National Committee staff for Seth Rich questioning ballot
[1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:52.080]  integrity during the election data summit.
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:55.240]  Rich had valid concerns during the Democratic primary the following year.
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:48:59.680]  The New York voters reported that two voter purges occurred of 120,000 people from being
[1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:00.680]  able to vote.
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:05.080]  The scandal months before Rich's death had led to massive outcry from supporters of
[1:49:05.080 --> 1:49:10.160]  Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders who believed in the DNC was engaging an election fraud
[1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:11.920]  to nominee Hillary Clinton.
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:15.920]  We're going to go to Jennifer and P.A. that wants to talk about that and then get Dr.
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:16.920]  Korsi's take.
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:20.040]  Jennifer, we're not supposed to look at Seth Rich's murder.
[1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:24.040]  Oh, yeah, apparently that is the case.
[1:49:24.040 --> 1:49:27.240]  I didn't want to touch on the whole story about Seth Rich.
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:30.880]  It just goes to show you whether it would have been the Trump movement or it would have
[1:49:30.880 --> 1:49:32.920]  been the Sanders movement.
[1:49:32.920 --> 1:49:37.240]  Either way, that points to what was going on in America at this time.
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:43.080]  So I wouldn't be surprised if more people did start just like they did with pedo, gay
[1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:44.080]  and all this stuff.
[1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:49.080]  I mean, now you have the tools to do that, you know, whereas 20, 30 years ago, you didn't.
[1:49:49.080 --> 1:49:52.240]  You didn't have the access to all this.
[1:49:52.240 --> 1:49:53.240]  That's right.
[1:49:53.240 --> 1:49:54.480]  Where do you think Seth Rich is going?
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:49:57.680]  They're really scared of that report.
[1:49:57.680 --> 1:50:04.080]  Seth Rich is really a danger to the entire establishment and look, we don't have the Washington
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:05.320]  Police Department report.
[1:50:05.320 --> 1:50:08.760]  We don't even know what hospital Seth Rich was taken to.
[1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:10.520]  The mainstream media won't cover it.
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:13.800]  You won't see anything in it in the Washington Post, the New York Times.
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:15.720]  They want to destroy the story.
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:20.560]  But yet we wrote, I published a three series articles on Info Wars that made it absolutely
[1:50:20.560 --> 1:50:23.960]  clear that Seth Rich was the leaker.
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:25.520]  It was an inside job.
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:27.040]  And he was executed.
[1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:28.440]  And he was executed.
[1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:32.240]  And the Democrats are going to do that consistently and cover it up.
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:38.760]  You know, they, I mean, the cable of executing a president and Donald Trump has got to watch
[1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:44.720]  as he is under attack for impeachment and if they can't impeach him, the other consequences
[1:50:44.720 --> 1:50:45.720]  are.
[1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:46.720]  That's right.
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:49.360]  We're going to take more calls, but then I want to ask Dr. Corsi.
[1:50:49.360 --> 1:50:51.600]  I mean, what happens if they kill Trump?
[1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:55.640]  I'd say 50-50, he's dead by a year from now.
[1:50:55.640 --> 1:50:59.400]  They're tending to kill him, stay with us.
[1:50:59.400 --> 1:51:03.960]  That's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[1:51:03.960 --> 1:51:05.520]  Those times may be near.
[1:51:05.520 --> 1:51:06.520]  Think about it.
[1:51:06.520 --> 1:51:11.200]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[1:51:11.200 --> 1:51:16.000]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:19.800]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages
[1:51:19.800 --> 1:51:21.800]  from a single cyber attack.
[1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:26.000]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.560]  during a widespread national emergency.
[1:51:28.560 --> 1:51:31.560]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:34.280]  That's where my Patriot supply comes in.

[1:51:58.920 --> 1:52:03.280]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:07.960]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[1:52:07.960 --> 1:52:09.480]  to detoxify the body.
[1:52:09.480 --> 1:52:14.320]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:15.840]  It's made in the USA.
[1:52:15.840 --> 1:52:20.720]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:22.560]  the body and it supports the M4.
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:24.800]  It is a classical 360-win.
[1:52:24.800 --> 1:52:29.280]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[1:52:29.280 --> 1:52:33.920]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[1:52:33.920 --> 1:52:34.920]  get.
[1:52:34.920 --> 1:52:38.120]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[1:52:38.120 --> 1:52:43.120]  country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:48.320]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[1:52:48.320 --> 1:52:51.000]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:54.320]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[1:52:54.320 --> 1:52:58.400]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and ForwardsLive.com.
[1:52:58.400 --> 1:53:02.280]  Many books have been written regarding the Law of Attraction, but what if all these books
[1:53:02.280 --> 1:53:06.080]  are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this
[1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:07.640]  law in our lives?
[1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:12.120]  The new book, It's Time to Align, the most powerful self-help book ever written by Alan
[1:53:12.120 --> 1:53:16.400]  Laudinger, takes a look at how the Law of Attraction really works and how it is being
[1:53:16.400 --> 1:53:18.160]  suppressed in our lives.
[1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:22.280]  Learn how to overcome this manipulation and how to experience alignment with the creative
[1:53:22.280 --> 1:53:23.760]  power of the universe.
[1:53:23.760 --> 1:53:28.080]  With the new book, it's time to align available at Amazon.com.
[1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:31.840]  Be prepared for the next disaster with the ShelterPod.

[1:53:55.240 --> 1:54:08.080]  Shelter when you need it most.
[1:54:08.080 --> 1:54:13.400]  The preacher man says, the preacher man says it's the end of time, you know I can broadcast
[1:54:13.400 --> 1:54:19.040]  and sound just like this, till I got on air that's how I talked but then over time I learned
[1:54:19.040 --> 1:54:24.400]  to talk faster so I could get more in but over time it gets worse and worse so I'm trying
[1:54:24.400 --> 1:54:26.920]  to slow it down.
[1:54:26.920 --> 1:54:30.520]  So everybody starts thinking Alex is talking a little slower sometime and I actually then
[1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:36.960]  sound like I'm from Texas that's what I sound like if I start talking slower but if I go
[1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:41.040]  into this mode I've been talking for more than half my life then it doesn't sound like
[1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:46.280]  I'm from Texas because I'm just shows how your speech patterns change as your job changes
[1:54:46.280 --> 1:54:53.120]  but nobody trained me so that's why the broadcast is all over the map here, the broadcast is
[1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:54.120]  really all about necessity.
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:58.200]  We're going to continue with your phone calls in the next hour, Roger Stone's going to
[1:54:58.200 --> 1:55:01.800]  join us, Dr. Corsi's going to write a little bit of shotgun with us, we can have a round
[1:55:01.800 --> 1:55:08.120]  table discussion but I do want to go back to your calls, a lot of calls about Comey
[1:55:08.120 --> 1:55:12.000]  and a lot of calls about Seth Rich and I see Corsi looking at the clock, if he's got to
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:16.560]  go at five after he can as well, I know he's doing a lot of interviews, how are you on
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:17.560]  time Dr. Corsi?
[1:55:17.560 --> 1:55:24.240]  I've got as much time as you want, I was actually just watching the basic news what's coming
[1:55:24.240 --> 1:55:28.120]  out of Washington right now and the attacks on Trump.
[1:55:28.120 --> 1:55:35.680]  I think this New York Times has just supported this assassination play and I think it's another
[1:55:35.680 --> 1:55:41.880]  attempt by the deep state to desensitize the American people to the kind of hit that
[1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:46.360]  was planned on JFK by the deep state, we're already getting desensitized, there's so much
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:51.720]  stuff out about it, assassination, assassination, assassination, I think the deep state is already
[1:55:51.720 --> 1:55:53.880]  telegraphing in its intent.
[1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:59.480]  We should do a whole broadcast, an emergency broadcast with a round table soon about what
[1:55:59.480 --> 1:56:04.440]  you just said, that is the most important thing I've heard in a year is clearly they
[1:56:04.440 --> 1:56:09.320]  are desensitizing the public so when he finally gets killed, there aren't riots, there's not
[1:56:09.320 --> 1:56:14.000]  freaking out, everybody's just heard it so much, we psychologically accept it, they are
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:17.600]  undoubtedly preparing us to assassinate Trump.
[1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:21.400]  You heard me say I think within a year of 50-50 he's dead, what do you think of that
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:23.920]  statement Dr. Corsi and can we stop it?
[1:56:23.920 --> 1:56:28.280]  Well I think first of all I've been writing, if you read my Twitter feeds and what I've
[1:56:28.280 --> 1:56:34.480]  been writing on Infowars, that right now Donald Trump is in the fight of his life.
[1:56:34.480 --> 1:56:38.960]  The Democrats either think that they can impeach him and this is the deep state, this is the
[1:56:38.960 --> 1:56:46.120]  deep state, the far left, funding the mainstream media, they think that this is all about finding
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:50.880]  some theme and it doesn't matter if it has any evidence or not, like gotcha enough, get
[1:56:50.880 --> 1:56:57.560]  a mistake to be made, just explain away what Comey says, keep pressing the Russian mem,
[1:56:57.560 --> 1:56:59.960]  that's all aimed at impeachment.
[1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:04.560]  If they can't impeach him, then they're going to assassinate him and we're getting telegraphed
[1:57:04.560 --> 1:57:09.120]  already that that plan is underway and it's the deep state as people who are within the
[1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:16.080]  CIA just like it was Alan Dulles and the others within the deep state that planned the assassination
[1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:18.080]  of Kennedy.
[1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:22.280]  And by the way, you've worked in and around presidents, you've known Trump 40 plus years,
[1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:27.360]  you did secret of work with the State Department as a consultant, you're a Harvard top graduate
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:30.720]  in international finance, I mean you know what you're talking about, you're in three
[1:57:30.720 --> 1:57:34.360]  time number one New York Times bestseller for people that are just joining us, you don't
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:38.480]  just say stuff like this, they're clearly preparing this, so let me ask you then we're
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:42.160]  going to break them right back to calls from Tom and John and Stephen and Morgan and O'Brien
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:43.680]  and Sam, we're going to go to everybody.
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:44.680]  What should Trump do?
[1:57:44.680 --> 1:57:48.320]  I mean he needs to get aggressive, call them out, sessions needs to start indicting some
[1:57:48.320 --> 1:57:49.320]  of these people.
[1:57:49.320 --> 1:57:54.640]  Well, the presidency has enormous power and Trump better start using it, better start
[1:57:54.640 --> 1:58:00.520]  realizing that in Washington, all these people are his enemies, he's got to fire previous,
[1:58:00.520 --> 1:58:04.040]  don't wait until the end of June as he says he's going to give him more time, just fire
[1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:05.040]  him.
[1:58:05.040 --> 1:58:09.040]  Get rid of all the people in the administration who have been there from Clinton and from
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:11.040]  Obama, get rid of them.
[1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:16.200]  And start using the Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate Comey, Clinton
[1:58:16.200 --> 1:58:17.920]  and the others.
[1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:19.560]  Fight back, counterattack.
[1:58:19.560 --> 1:58:24.000]  Absolutely, look this is such tradition against the country and the attempted overthrow of
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:28.320]  our republic by clear outside forces, I support the president right now moving against these
[1:58:28.320 --> 1:58:29.320]  people physically.
[1:58:29.320 --> 1:58:34.200]  I mean, let's be honest, we're in a war, I would support the president making a military
[1:58:34.200 --> 1:58:35.200]  move on him right now.
[1:58:35.200 --> 1:58:36.200]  The country's in that bigger crisis.
[1:58:36.200 --> 1:58:38.200]  We need to go ahead and move.
[1:58:38.200 --> 1:58:49.800]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:54.880]  Over the weekend, Act for America held human rights marches across the United States, marching
[1:58:54.880 --> 1:58:59.240]  against Sharia law, which prohibits certain human rights to women and countries where
[1:58:59.240 --> 1:59:01.760]  Sharia law is in practice, oppress women.
[1:59:01.760 --> 1:59:05.920]  So leave it to Antifa to show up and disrupt these Americans first amendment right, but
[1:59:05.920 --> 1:59:07.360]  it didn't stop there.
[1:59:07.360 --> 1:59:11.280]  Journalists like myself got assaulted and cursed at just for documenting the event.
[1:59:11.280 --> 1:59:16.240]  Lauren Southern even had animal urine thrown at him while filming in the New York City
[1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:17.520]  march against Sharia.
[1:59:17.520 --> 1:59:20.000]  If it wasn't obvious before, it is now.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.600]  CNN and Antifa are ISIS.
[1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:26.640]  It is freaked out when a burqa was put on Fearless Girl in New York City, faced with
[1:59:26.640 --> 1:59:29.320]  the imagery of the oppression they were supporting.
[1:59:29.320 --> 1:59:33.520]  The same people that are now supporting Sharia law in America were the same people who were
[1:59:33.520 --> 1:59:38.000]  so helplessly offended by Donald Trump's grab her by the private comment.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:42.800]  So Trump's inappropriate private conversation is unacceptable, but forced female genital
[1:59:42.800 --> 1:59:44.560]  mutilation is okay.
[1:59:44.560 --> 1:59:46.880]  The left has literally lost their minds.
[1:59:46.880 --> 1:59:53.880]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Shroyer.
[2:00:16.880 --> 2:00:27.400]  We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else.
[2:00:27.400 --> 2:00:31.920]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, but El Castro took the
[2:00:31.920 --> 2:00:32.920]  guns.
[2:00:32.920 --> 2:00:41.800]  You know Chavez took the guns, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[2:00:41.800 --> 2:00:48.800]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[2:00:48.800 --> 2:00:57.920]  I am sworn upon the alter of God, internal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[2:00:57.920 --> 2:00:58.920]  the mind of man.
[2:00:58.920 --> 2:01:05.880]  The answer to 1884 is John in Wisconsin, then Tom in Oregon, then Morgan in everybody.
[2:01:05.880 --> 2:01:11.600]  And we've got, of course, Dr. Corsese, our guest riding shotgun a little bit in the next
[2:01:11.600 --> 2:01:12.600]  hour with us.
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:18.560]  Dr. Stose will be joining us as well and taking calls and breaking some of the new news here.
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:19.560]  But good things are happening.
[2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:23.520]  There's not just forces of evil, but they are clearly preparing the assassination of
[2:01:23.520 --> 2:01:24.520]  Trump.
[2:01:24.520 --> 2:01:25.520]  You can say that.
[2:01:25.520 --> 2:01:26.520]  They've got COG ready.
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:29.200]  They're going to claim that all the Republicans that got elected are defunct, that's been
[2:01:29.200 --> 2:01:32.840]  announced by the establishment, and really try to then shut down the free press and
[2:01:32.840 --> 2:01:34.400]  show up the country.
[2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:39.040]  That's why I said that when you're faced with globalists working with Muslims and communists
[2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:43.760]  beating up protesters nationwide yesterday and you're faced with an outside foreign-owned
[2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:48.320]  media saying civil war, kill conservatives, to defend the Republic against this outside
[2:01:48.320 --> 2:01:53.360]  threat, if they don't back down, I mean, I think that the president's going to have
[2:01:53.360 --> 2:01:57.520]  to declare his own emergency and move against these people criminally, Dr. Corsese.
[2:01:57.520 --> 2:01:58.760]  That's standard procedure.
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:03.840]  Well, you know, the whole issue is that Donald Trump has got control of an enormous power
[2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:04.840]  in his president.
[2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:09.480]  If he doesn't counterattack, if he doesn't change the narrative, if he doesn't get this
[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:14.120]  Russian meme off the table, maybe there's an easy way to do it.
[2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:18.480]  Pardon Flynn, and now Mueller's got no target to go after.
[2:02:18.480 --> 2:02:19.480]  Don't make any doubt about it.
[2:02:19.480 --> 2:02:24.560]  Mueller's game right now is to develop an indictment, a criminal indictment at Kelly,
[2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:31.280]  which will keep, I'm sorry, a web Flynn, which will keep the Russian narrative, General
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:35.720]  Flynn can be indicted criminally, we'll spend the rest of this year talking about Russian
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:42.720]  collusion or Trump's obstruction to be changed into, remember, when the left lost on a global
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:44.520]  warming, it became climate change.
[2:02:44.520 --> 2:02:49.800]  Well, when they lost on Russian collusion, it's gonna morph into Trump obstructing justice.
[2:02:49.800 --> 2:02:54.080]  Well, they said that two weeks ago, they said it's now about criminal stuff, not about Russia.
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:58.640]  When they're the ones involved in espionage, let's go to John in Wisconsin, you're on
[2:02:58.640 --> 2:02:59.640]  the air.
[2:02:59.640 --> 2:03:00.640]  Thanks for holding.
[2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:04.920]  Yeah, that's of course, it's a pleasure being able to talk to you.
[2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:09.080]  I gotta tell you about Seth Rich.
[2:03:09.080 --> 2:03:16.600]  I think what was going on is that he was ready to dump on another data dump to WikiLeaks,
[2:03:16.600 --> 2:03:24.760]  and they followed him, and whoever he was supposed to pass it to was warned off.
[2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:30.520]  And I don't know about you, but every computer geek I know uses flash drives.
[2:03:30.520 --> 2:03:33.880]  I bet you he had it on a flash drive in his pocket.
[2:03:33.880 --> 2:03:38.680]  That's why nobody found anything missing on him except the flash drive.
[2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:41.680]  Now, either they got the flash drive or he threw the way he wanted to do it.
[2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:44.720]  Well, the evidence that he was the leakers overwhelming and the fact that he was executed
[2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:45.720]  is overwhelming.
[2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:46.720]  Nothing was taken.
[2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:48.000]  It's clear they've gotten to the family.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  Dr. Corsi?
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:54.720]  Well, and I think it was taken with a thumb drive because Podesta had left his Alpine
[2:03:54.720 --> 2:03:58.560]  Apple ID and password with his staff.
[2:03:58.560 --> 2:03:59.680]  All you needed to do is get that.
[2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:04.360]  I'm sure he used the same password as run or something or other, and you could have easily
[2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:06.520]  gotten into his Gmail server.
[2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:11.720]  I'm sure he never erased any of his Gmail emails, and all you had to do is put a thumb
[2:04:11.720 --> 2:04:13.920]  drive in and download them all.
[2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:16.560]  It was an easy inside job.
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:23.640]  And even President Trump talked about it as being a leak for WikiLeaks, not a hack.
[2:04:23.640 --> 2:04:26.520]  Usiver too did not hack those files.
[2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:32.560]  He was hacking the whole computers to the NGA Vans system, which was the voter and donor
[2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:34.560]  data, not the emails.
[2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:35.560]  It's obvious.
[2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:36.560]  That's right.
[2:04:36.560 --> 2:04:37.560]  An inside job was responsible.
[2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:38.560]  That's right.
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:41.160]  Hillary lost the election, not the Russians.
[2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:42.320]  They didn't win the election.
[2:04:42.320 --> 2:04:43.480]  Hillary lost it.
[2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:45.560]  They're losers and they can't stand it.
[2:04:45.560 --> 2:04:47.560]  Anything else, John?
[2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:54.760]  I think that all I did about being in touch with a woman that was uncorrelated.
[2:04:54.760 --> 2:04:55.760]  Sure, sure.
[2:04:55.760 --> 2:04:57.760]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[2:04:57.760 --> 2:05:00.280]  All right, let him go.
[2:05:00.280 --> 2:05:02.400]  The collapse of the left continues.
[2:05:02.400 --> 2:05:06.080]  If it isn't Maxine Waters or Nancy Pelosi having a mental breakdown.
[2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:09.280]  If it isn't Snoop Doggity Dogg pretending to shoot President Trump.
[2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:14.400]  If it isn't Kathy Griffin going full ISIS and depicting herself with a decapitated trumpet.
[2:05:14.400 --> 2:05:18.400]  It's the New York Public Theater depicting the assassination of President Trump in their
[2:05:18.400 --> 2:05:20.800]  latest installment of Shakespeare in the Park.
[2:05:20.800 --> 2:05:25.360]  The play depicted President Trump as the modern day Julius Caesar, this time being stabbed
[2:05:25.360 --> 2:05:29.040]  to death by minorities and women, a clear subliminal message.
[2:05:29.040 --> 2:05:35.320]  Leave it to CNN to endorse such an atrocity, as Fareed Zakaria said the play is a masterpiece.
[2:05:35.320 --> 2:05:39.760]  But the disturbing presentation did not go without consequences, as major sponsors of
[2:05:39.760 --> 2:05:44.480]  the theater have now pulled their sponsorship dollars, such as Delta Airlines and Bank of
[2:05:44.480 --> 2:05:48.960]  America, who have supported the theater to the tunes of millions in the past.
[2:05:48.960 --> 2:05:51.320]  The suicide of the left is real.
[2:05:51.320 --> 2:05:59.440]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[2:05:59.440 --> 2:06:03.560]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save

[2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:07.200]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war.
[2:07:07.200 --> 2:07:11.920]  Bring the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:18.200]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[2:07:18.200 --> 2:07:20.720]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[2:07:20.720 --> 2:07:25.080]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[2:07:25.080 --> 2:07:29.760]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[2:07:29.760 --> 2:07:30.760]  vitality.
[2:07:30.760 --> 2:07:34.720]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[2:07:34.720 --> 2:07:38.160]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[2:07:38.160 --> 2:07:46.160]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[2:07:46.160 --> 2:07:49.440]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[2:07:49.440 --> 2:07:52.320]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[2:07:52.320 --> 2:07:57.240]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com
[2:07:57.240 --> 2:08:08.120]  with Anthroplex.
[2:08:08.120 --> 2:08:14.120]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:08:14.120 --> 2:08:21.120]  Mother, tell your children not to walk my way.
[2:08:21.120 --> 2:08:24.120]  Tell your children not to hear my words.
[2:08:24.120 --> 2:08:26.120]  What they mean, what they say.
[2:08:26.120 --> 2:08:33.120]  Mother, can you keep them in the dark for a while?
[2:08:33.120 --> 2:08:39.120]  Can you hide them from the wedding world?
[2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:42.120]  Oh, mother.
[2:08:42.120 --> 2:08:43.120]  Mother!
[2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:48.400]  You know, I concur with Dr. Corsi.
[2:08:48.400 --> 2:08:49.400]  It's hiding in plain view.
[2:08:49.400 --> 2:08:53.640]  They've had the Atlantic Monthly call for it, The Washington Post, New Yorker Magazine,
[2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:56.100]  all the established publications.
[2:08:56.100 --> 2:08:58.400]  They've worked themselves into a frenzy.
[2:08:58.400 --> 2:09:01.320]  They had The Washington Post come out this weekend and admit they lie about Trump.
[2:09:01.320 --> 2:09:02.720]  They say he deserves it.
[2:09:02.720 --> 2:09:04.120]  He's a bad guy.
[2:09:04.120 --> 2:09:10.840]  New York Times comes out and says, Comey never said Trump said, stopped the investigation.
[2:09:10.840 --> 2:09:16.720]  They say that he did say that, despite the fact that we have the videos of Comey saying
[2:09:16.720 --> 2:09:19.320]  that Trump never told him, stopped the investigation.
[2:09:19.320 --> 2:09:25.640]  They have reached levels of North Korean lies, North Korean state-run media lies.
[2:09:25.640 --> 2:09:30.480]  I've studied dictatorships because they're so interesting and so horrible and usually
[2:09:30.480 --> 2:09:37.600]  even the most out-of-control Romanian Chalcescu nightmares don't go this far.
[2:09:37.600 --> 2:09:42.520]  Pravda was the absolute standard of deception.
[2:09:42.520 --> 2:09:45.040]  No news or no truth in Pravda.
[2:09:45.040 --> 2:09:49.120]  The Russians make jokes about it now saying our media is worse than Pravda because they
[2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:50.760]  know Pravda was horrible.
[2:09:50.760 --> 2:09:55.760]  So we've now reached a level so epic, I don't know what to say, and the fact that they sent
[2:09:55.760 --> 2:10:00.160]  Kelly here, who totally lied, said it wouldn't be a hit piece and the whole thing was five
[2:10:00.160 --> 2:10:04.200]  times asking the same question over and over again and then putting a promo piece out that's
[2:10:04.200 --> 2:10:09.120]  totally edited is going to be absolutely incredible.
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:11.920]  It shows they're going after all of Trump's allies.
[2:10:11.920 --> 2:10:14.560]  They are preparing everybody.
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:16.600]  I believe to assassinate President Trump.
[2:10:16.600 --> 2:10:20.880]  I mean, they're saying kill him everywhere, Time Warner is sponsoring plays where Trump
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:21.880]  is murdered.
[2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:25.680]  The media is pushing Kathy Griffin saying, you know, kill Trump.
[2:10:25.680 --> 2:10:28.760]  The New York Times, The Washington Post have their writer's call for killing Trump.
[2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:31.480]  Fareed Zarkaria hails Trump assassination.
[2:10:31.480 --> 2:10:33.600]  That's the headline.
[2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:35.160]  That's up on infowars.com.
[2:10:35.160 --> 2:10:39.080]  So we'll be going to your calls of Brian, Sam, Morgan, Tom and Stephen.
[2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:45.360]  I'll at least get to you guys and ride the shotgun for the rest of the hour is Roger Stone.
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:46.920]  We're getting ready to expand very soon.
[2:10:46.920 --> 2:10:50.400]  We're hiring extra crew put in the new studio.
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:51.400]  Stone having a show.
[2:10:51.400 --> 2:10:52.400]  Others having a show.
[2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:53.400]  Roundtable broadcast.
[2:10:53.400 --> 2:10:54.400]  You name it.
[2:10:54.400 --> 2:10:56.000]  Very exciting because the info war is exploding.
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:10:58.760]  The people are waking up and the establishment knows that.
[2:10:58.760 --> 2:11:03.840]  But now we have this new person from the Enron investigation and others that they're bringing
[2:11:03.840 --> 2:11:06.520]  on to Mueller's investigation.
[2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:09.480]  Why isn't Comey getting investigated for perjury?
[2:11:09.480 --> 2:11:11.920]  Why isn't Comey getting investigated for criminal leaking?
[2:11:11.920 --> 2:11:18.280]  Why isn't Loretta Lynch getting investigated for admitting that she engaged in obstruction
[2:11:18.280 --> 2:11:19.280]  of justice?
[2:11:19.280 --> 2:11:24.280]  What is the deep state creeping around and doing?
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:25.280]  This is amazing.
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:30.720]  They seem so confident, so brazen to try to whip up and condition the public for the assassination
[2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:35.720]  of Donald John Trump, who has killed TPP, who has killed the carbon tax with our economy
[2:11:35.720 --> 2:11:37.640]  coming back roaring.
[2:11:37.640 --> 2:11:43.640]  You can't help but admire Trump, but then he's not doing the fireside chat.
[2:11:43.640 --> 2:11:45.800]  He's not attacking enough.
[2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:50.600]  Does he know the great peril he's in and what happens if they do kill Trump?
[2:11:50.600 --> 2:11:54.320]  I don't believe all the preconditioning of his assassination.
[2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:55.320]  They're foreshadowing.
[2:11:55.320 --> 2:11:56.440]  They're prelude.
[2:11:56.440 --> 2:11:57.440]  They're conditioning.
[2:11:57.440 --> 2:11:58.920]  They're psychological inoculation.
[2:11:58.920 --> 2:12:00.240]  I don't believe it's going to float.
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:03.760]  I believe it will supercharge the populist movement.
[2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:08.680]  Their attempt to come in and shut us down that will come after that attack, obviously,
[2:12:08.680 --> 2:12:10.880]  is going to cause an explosion of awakening.
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:16.480]  I mean, this just shows the same arrogance they had with Hillary running that vicious
[2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:21.000]  demonic corpse against Trump in the campaign and all the fake polls, Roger Stone.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  What say ye?
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:28.200]  Well, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[2:12:28.200 --> 2:12:33.960]  The level of falsehood in the media today is unlike anything that I have seen.
[2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:44.360]  Yesterday's New York Times has a car, which UK is a breakdown of how seven Trump associates
[2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:51.200]  have been late to read that yours truly.
[2:12:51.200 --> 2:12:59.360]  It says the prominent inform advisor to Trump had no in advance about the release of Russian
[2:12:59.360 --> 2:13:01.880]  hacked documents by WikiLeaks.
[2:13:01.880 --> 2:13:04.520]  I have never said anything whatsoever.
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:08.360]  I never spoke about hacked documents or hacked emails.
[2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:17.120]  It goes on to say that this was perfectly legal communications I claimed through communications
[2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:19.120]  with Julian Assange.
[2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:24.840]  I never said I had a direct communications with Julian Assange.
[2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:27.800]  The Times is now zero for three.
[2:13:27.800 --> 2:13:37.320]  Lastly, they say I exchanged direct messages with Guccifer 2.0, an online figure linked
[2:13:37.320 --> 2:13:43.080]  to Russian intelligence, well, linked by the deep state, but not linked by anybody who
[2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:44.720]  can look at it objectively.
[2:13:44.720 --> 2:13:52.440]  The Times does correctly point out at the very bottom of the article that I had contact
[2:13:52.440 --> 2:13:59.360]  with him six weeks after the hacking of the DNC documents.
[2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:03.280]  So part and parcel, I don't know who wrote this, somebody from the Democratic Staff of
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:05.000]  the House Intelligence Committee.
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:09.480]  I can tell you now what the status of my testifying is.
[2:14:09.480 --> 2:14:17.120]  I insist on testifying in public that they denied me that opportunity.
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:25.120]  They have offered in return to let me testify in private with a transcript being released.
[2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:29.800]  You'll love this part, Alex, at some point in the future.
[2:14:29.800 --> 2:14:34.240]  So in other words, you would go testify behind closed doors.
[2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:38.400]  They would come out and misrepresent what you said they would savage you while you sat
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:43.480]  around with your thumb and you're waiting for the actual transcript.
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:46.240]  This is not what I had in mind.
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:48.960]  Your Skype's breaking up a bit, but it's starting to clear up something to repeat that this
[2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:51.920]  is big breaking news with Roger Stone.
[2:14:51.920 --> 2:14:54.680]  They've been saying you're a Russian agent for over a year with no proof.
[2:14:54.680 --> 2:14:57.160]  They've been caught lying at every front.
[2:14:57.160 --> 2:15:01.280]  Of course, as a journalist, you reached out to WikiLeaks and Guccifer, the media was all
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:02.280]  reaching out for him.
[2:15:02.280 --> 2:15:06.240]  I had CNN calling here, you know, a year ago saying, do you know Guccifer, how do we get
[2:15:06.240 --> 2:15:07.240]  in touch with him?
[2:15:07.240 --> 2:15:08.240]  I'm like, no.
[2:15:08.240 --> 2:15:11.240]  This just goes on and on and on.
[2:15:11.240 --> 2:15:12.760]  And you got hit with polonium.
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:13.760]  They tried to kill you.
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:16.880]  They tried to run you over because they want a dead man.
[2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:18.280]  They can pin it all on.
[2:15:18.280 --> 2:15:20.520]  You've been begging to publicly testify.
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:24.840]  And now they say you can testify in secret and someday we might release a transcript
[2:15:24.840 --> 2:15:31.440]  just like Comey, who we all said was probably the leaker, releases this fake memo, let them
[2:15:31.440 --> 2:15:35.400]  lie about what's in it for over a month, and then is forced to come out and admit that
[2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:39.480]  Trump never ordered him to block the investigation because he knew that would show he perjured
[2:15:39.480 --> 2:15:42.640]  himself on the May 3rd congressional testimony.
[2:15:42.640 --> 2:15:44.920]  So they are, they are so transparent.
[2:15:44.920 --> 2:15:46.720]  They are so obvious.
[2:15:46.720 --> 2:15:52.280]  How much danger are we, how much danger are we in of them winning?
[2:15:52.280 --> 2:15:59.480]  Well, Alex, you know, I think many Trump supporters were jubilant last week because
[2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:07.360]  I'm going to put you on hold when it's this bad, just a default case, I'm not here.
[2:16:07.360 --> 2:16:08.360]  We'll go to telephone.
[2:16:08.360 --> 2:16:10.280]  We'll still have Skype with, with Stone.
[2:16:10.280 --> 2:16:12.520]  So we'll see him, but we'll go to telephone.
[2:16:12.520 --> 2:16:13.960]  That's the default when Skype's that bad.
[2:16:13.960 --> 2:16:17.040]  We're doing some training today with a new gray crew.
[2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:19.480]  So that's a default at that point when something breaks up for more than two minutes, you
[2:16:19.480 --> 2:16:20.480]  just go to a phone call.
[2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:22.760]  We're doing training today as we expand here.
[2:16:22.760 --> 2:16:24.320]  Rumors of our demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[2:16:24.320 --> 2:16:26.120]  We've never been better, never been expanding more.
[2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:31.200]  Thanks to our illustrious prayers and financial support and the great affiliates out there.
[2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:36.880]  This is incredible, Dr. Corsi, that they continue to, again, like I said, they're never going
[2:16:36.880 --> 2:16:38.160]  to stop the meme.
[2:16:38.160 --> 2:16:40.000]  They're going to keep hammering this thing.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:42.920]  They've had congressional hearings saying, I'm a Russian agent, and Hillary said, as
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:45.720]  you know, two weeks ago, I advised the Russians.
[2:16:45.720 --> 2:16:50.400]  So she actually said, I'm the super mastermind in her full five minute clip.
[2:16:50.400 --> 2:16:54.600]  She says, oh, the Russians aren't smart enough to come up with Americana stuff.
[2:16:54.600 --> 2:16:59.680]  It's info wars, and then they get it from him, and then it comes back to the United
[2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:00.680]  States.
[2:17:00.680 --> 2:17:03.560]  So I am now, I'm not kidding, the mastermind.
[2:17:03.560 --> 2:17:04.560]  What a load of manure.
[2:17:04.560 --> 2:17:10.120]  Well, Alex, I think you're going to look at this from a disinformation propaganda technique's
[2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:11.280]  perspective.
[2:17:11.280 --> 2:17:19.680]  First of all, the mainstream media right now is backed by the intelligence deep state.
[2:17:19.680 --> 2:17:20.680]  Trump's on trial.
[2:17:20.680 --> 2:17:26.440]  He doesn't know, he's being impeached right now, and the accusation is that he's colluded
[2:17:26.440 --> 2:17:31.680]  with the Russians, and this is all Russian propaganda.
[2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:36.600]  Trump is encouraging, and you're an agent of the Russian propaganda.
[2:17:36.600 --> 2:17:40.880]  And if they don't impeach him, if they can impeach him, remember, nothing that comes
[2:17:40.880 --> 2:17:44.720]  out in defense of Trump is ever going to be reported by the mainstream media.
[2:17:44.720 --> 2:17:51.120]  Comey's lies are the fact that we, you know, the wheeler is going to go after Flynn.
[2:17:51.120 --> 2:17:53.840]  We don't have Loretta Lynch being investigated.
[2:17:53.840 --> 2:17:55.360]  Hillary Clinton was given a pass.
[2:17:55.360 --> 2:17:59.600]  And so it doesn't matter that Comey fell on his face pathetically, none of that will
[2:17:59.600 --> 2:18:00.600]  be reported.
[2:18:00.600 --> 2:18:04.080]  That's why listeners must get the articles and info wars that show the clips out to
[2:18:04.080 --> 2:18:05.080]  everyone.
[2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:06.080]  Roger, you got cut off.
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:07.680]  Repeat that now that we have better audio.
[2:18:07.680 --> 2:18:11.760]  You're saying they now say, okay, you can testify in secret, and maybe someday after
[2:18:11.760 --> 2:18:15.200]  we kill you, we might release it.
[2:18:15.200 --> 2:18:20.040]  Not only that, Alex, but they propose to have two Republicans and two Democrats as opposed
[2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:22.040]  to the entire panel.
[2:18:22.040 --> 2:18:29.560]  I noticed that Senator Sessions' testimony today is in public, and I think I should therefore
[2:18:29.560 --> 2:18:32.280]  be allowed to testify in public.
[2:18:32.280 --> 2:18:34.920]  After all, they smeared me in public.
[2:18:34.920 --> 2:18:42.040]  They made misstatements about my relationship with WikiLeaks or lack thereof.
[2:18:42.040 --> 2:18:47.640]  Let me pick up on the key point here, because I think last week, many key Trump supporters
[2:18:47.640 --> 2:18:56.240]  were jubilant over the fact that Comey's testimony was so self-damaging that he revealed himself
[2:18:56.240 --> 2:19:01.880]  as a leaker and that he did lay a glove on the president in terms of collusion.
[2:19:01.880 --> 2:19:07.760]  But mark my words with Robert Euler, the fix is in.
[2:19:07.760 --> 2:19:12.600]  This guy is a neocon Bush era errand boy.
[2:19:12.600 --> 2:19:18.800]  He was Comey's direct boss at the FBI, the FBI director prior to Comey, and we now know
[2:19:18.800 --> 2:19:25.520]  he met with Comey to coach him on his testimony last week.
[2:19:25.520 --> 2:19:33.360]  Comey has hired this fellow, Andrew Weissman, from the Department of Justice, the Bush
[2:19:33.360 --> 2:19:35.720]  era Department of Justice.
[2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:38.280]  This guy is the executioner.
[2:19:38.280 --> 2:19:44.800]  Make no mistake about it, regardless of the facts, Mueller is part and parcel of the effort
[2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:46.640]  to take down Trump.
[2:19:46.640 --> 2:19:49.240]  This fight is not over, it's just beginning.
[2:19:49.240 --> 2:19:53.240]  Yeah, Polk's thought Trump went in the election, I'll go to sleep, no, no, they're gonna come
[2:19:53.240 --> 2:19:54.800]  in with pure authoritarianism now.
[2:19:54.800 --> 2:19:59.280]  We're in a fight for our lives, all of us.
[2:19:59.280 --> 2:20:04.120]  This is Michael David from Seattle, I'm 51 years old, and six months ago I started taking
[2:20:04.120 --> 2:20:07.040]  Andrew 400 to increase my testosterone.
[2:20:07.040 --> 2:20:12.280]  Since then I've lost 35 pounds of fat, my waist went from size 38 to size 32.
[2:20:12.280 --> 2:20:17.040]  I have more energy, and I looked and feel 20 years younger, and now my wife tells me
[2:20:17.040 --> 2:20:18.840]  I have to take Andrew 400.
[2:20:18.840 --> 2:20:21.440]  Hi, this is Ron Johnson from Utah.
[2:20:21.440 --> 2:20:27.080]  After 10 weeks of taking Andrew 400, I lost 13 pounds and my waist went from 36 to 33.
[2:20:27.080 --> 2:20:28.320]  That was eight years ago.
[2:20:28.320 --> 2:20:33.040]  I continue to take Andrew 400 and I've maintained my weight at 172.
[2:20:33.040 --> 2:20:38.120]  Gained muscle and energy, I'm 63 now and feel better than I have in 30 years.
[2:20:38.120 --> 2:20:44.720]  Andrew 400, the natural way to increase testosterone, lose belly fat, gain energy and feel great.
[2:20:44.720 --> 2:20:49.800]  Try Andrew 400, the safe, effective, affordable way to boost your testosterone.

[2:20:58.680 --> 2:21:00.560]  Imbricks Essentials, that's my middle name.
[2:21:00.560 --> 2:21:06.840]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[2:21:06.840 --> 2:21:12.160]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[2:21:12.160 --> 2:21:13.160]  and high quality.
[2:21:13.160 --> 2:21:19.360]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality
[2:21:19.360 --> 2:21:22.280]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[2:21:22.280 --> 2:21:26.760]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[2:21:26.760 --> 2:21:30.720]  It is an answer to prayer and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail,
[2:21:30.720 --> 2:21:33.920]  sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[2:21:33.920 --> 2:21:35.000]  It's all there.
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:40.400]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game changing.
[2:21:40.400 --> 2:21:44.960]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Imbricks Essentials and it's
[2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:51.240]  on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from infowarstore.com.
[2:21:51.240 --> 2:21:55.600]  Help us with the info war while getting products here by needs, infowarslife.com, where you'll
[2:21:55.600 --> 2:21:58.280]  find the entire line of Imbricks Essentials.
[2:21:58.280 --> 2:22:02.760]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former Congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[2:22:02.760 --> 2:22:07.120]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables
[2:22:07.120 --> 2:22:10.920]  that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[2:22:10.920 --> 2:22:13.920]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[2:22:13.920 --> 2:22:17.760]  Know you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors.
[2:22:17.760 --> 2:22:20.600]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[2:22:20.600 --> 2:22:24.720]  It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[2:22:24.720 --> 2:22:28.880]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[2:22:28.880 --> 2:22:34.160]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[2:22:34.160 --> 2:22:38.660]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long lasting
[2:22:38.660 --> 2:22:39.960]  food on hand.
[2:22:39.960 --> 2:22:43.320]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[2:22:43.320 --> 2:22:45.040]  We love our freeze dryer.
[2:22:45.040 --> 2:22:51.440]  To learn more, go to HarvestRight.com or call 800-923-9591.
[2:22:51.440 --> 2:22:57.720]  That's HarvestRight.com or 800-923-9591.
[2:22:57.720 --> 2:22:59.440]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[2:22:59.440 --> 2:23:04.240]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory, and delicious.
[2:23:04.240 --> 2:23:07.880]  I buy some, I use some, I store some, awesome.
[2:23:07.880 --> 2:23:12.400]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life, NASA-packed technology.
[2:23:12.400 --> 2:23:17.760]  Bacon, fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon, or warm
[2:23:17.760 --> 2:23:18.760]  and serve.
[2:23:18.760 --> 2:23:25.520]  Life-saving, ready to eat bacon, 10-year shelf life bacon, ships free at fullycookedbacon.com,
[2:23:25.520 --> 2:23:27.520]  fullycookedbacon.com.
[2:23:27.520 --> 2:23:28.520]  It's a no-brainer.
[2:23:28.520 --> 2:23:30.800]  A big, burky water filter is the one you need, period.
[2:23:30.800 --> 2:23:34.800]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other
[2:23:34.800 --> 2:23:38.840]  endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[2:23:38.840 --> 2:23:40.800]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:44.400]  The original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Burky.
[2:23:44.400 --> 2:23:49.120]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[2:23:49.120 --> 2:23:53.520]  Call or click 1-877-99-Burky, or bigburkywaterfilters.com.
[2:23:53.520 --> 2:23:56.520]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[2:23:56.520 --> 2:24:03.560]  All right, final segment with these two gentlemen.
[2:24:03.560 --> 2:24:04.560]  I'll continue with your calls.
[2:24:04.560 --> 2:24:07.360]  Our reporters are going to be in studio.
[2:24:07.360 --> 2:24:11.600]  I watch footage from all over the country, but I also watch the footage that they shot
[2:24:11.600 --> 2:24:18.360]  of people in communist uniforms and Islamic garb beating men, women, and children reporters
[2:24:18.360 --> 2:24:20.120]  over the head with clubs.
[2:24:20.120 --> 2:24:23.600]  The state police here in Austin would just stop them from beating, and they've got them
[2:24:23.600 --> 2:24:26.320]  with their own clubs attacking the police.
[2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:29.320]  We're going to have some of the boil down of those hours of footage here for you all
[2:24:29.320 --> 2:24:30.920]  describing for radio listeners.
[2:24:30.920 --> 2:24:36.480]  But here's why this hits so hard before I finish up with Roger Stone and Dr. Corsi.
[2:24:36.480 --> 2:24:39.080]  Here's the really bad news.
[2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:41.400]  Trump loses travel ban ruling and appeals court.
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:47.200]  Folks, the law is so clear the president can ban people from countries, period, if he wants.
[2:24:47.200 --> 2:24:48.360]  Look at all the other nations that do it.
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:54.000]  We have seven countries, total fell states, where the imams issue the passports, places
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:56.280]  like Somalia and Libya.
[2:24:56.280 --> 2:25:02.760]  And the fourth circuit agreed with the Hawaiian court and the night circuit and said, quote,
[2:25:02.760 --> 2:25:10.200]  he violated the constitution's ban on government establishment of religion, the first amendment.
[2:25:10.200 --> 2:25:12.600]  So the government's running religion in this country.
[2:25:12.600 --> 2:25:15.520]  The IRS is controlling it, not supposed to do it in the first amendment.
[2:25:15.520 --> 2:25:20.080]  You have a political religion like Islam, failed states, the president bans it and they're
[2:25:20.080 --> 2:25:26.400]  using the first amendment that guarantees the right to religion and says you can't
[2:25:26.400 --> 2:25:31.760]  have government established religion to bring in Islam that is a government of the establishment
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:37.120]  of religion that says Sharia law will overwrite the constitution and will not accept other
[2:25:37.120 --> 2:25:39.560]  religion.
[2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:44.280]  It's like bringing cancer in and saying because we're anti-cancer.
[2:25:44.280 --> 2:25:47.120]  I mean, the courts, the system, they're all against Trump.
[2:25:47.120 --> 2:25:51.320]  He has stopped 43% of the illegals coming in, but you talk about a government in total
[2:25:51.320 --> 2:25:55.840]  mutiny against his president, I want to get Roger Stone's take on that and then we'll
[2:25:55.840 --> 2:25:56.840]  let him go.
[2:25:56.840 --> 2:25:57.840]  I appreciate him popping in today.
[2:25:57.840 --> 2:25:59.480]  Roger Stone, your take on this.
[2:25:59.480 --> 2:26:00.480]  Any other tidbits?
[2:26:00.480 --> 2:26:03.200]  Well, Alan Chiu raised a very good point.
[2:26:03.200 --> 2:26:11.080]  It was Mr. Mueller, who was in charge of removing all of the references to Islamic jihad in
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:17.880]  terror from the FBI training materials, and he even issued a public apology to care for
[2:26:17.880 --> 2:26:18.880]  being insensitive.
[2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:19.880]  God.
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:26.880]  If this doesn't prove that Mr. Mueller is part of the problem, I don't know what does.
[2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:34.280]  We also know that Mr. Mueller as the FBI director warned Georgia Congressman Bob Barr
[2:26:34.280 --> 2:26:40.080]  not asking questions about Waco to back off on the questions of why the government assaulted
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:41.680]  the compound on Waco.
[2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:49.280]  This guy is a neocon errand boy, and the job he assigned him is taking down Donald Trump.
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:51.280]  Is he a Wahhabist like Brennan?
[2:26:51.280 --> 2:26:55.440]  I mean, why are all our leaders under the control of radical Muslims?
[2:26:55.440 --> 2:26:57.360]  I don't think so.
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:27:04.440]  I don't know Mr. Mueller's religion, but he is most clearly an establishment darling
[2:27:04.440 --> 2:27:08.440]  appointed by George W. Bush to head the FBI.
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:12.360]  Sure, but why did he remove all references to radical Islam from the FBI and not let
[2:27:12.360 --> 2:27:13.720]  him go after him at San Bernardino?
[2:27:13.720 --> 2:27:16.920]  I mean, he's known as the protector of radical Islam.
[2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:21.240]  Yeah, because that's the politically correct position, and that was the position of the
[2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:23.240]  Obama administration.
[2:27:23.240 --> 2:27:27.440]  Islam is a religion of love, Alex, didn't you know that?
[2:27:27.440 --> 2:27:29.640]  It's a religion of love and peace.
[2:27:29.640 --> 2:27:31.840]  Hey, I want to get you and Corsi here later in the week.
[2:27:31.840 --> 2:27:36.160]  We've got to get some stuff done, some contracts done for you to get on board and some planning,
[2:27:36.160 --> 2:27:37.360]  but I wanted to get you both here together.
[2:27:37.360 --> 2:27:40.800]  There's also some big stuff going on, as you know, with a lot of heavy hitters.
[2:27:40.800 --> 2:27:44.640]  So can you guys talk later today about getting you here at the same time to actually not
[2:27:44.640 --> 2:27:47.400]  just go on air, but get some stuff done?
[2:27:47.400 --> 2:27:50.040]  Certainly we can figure that out.
[2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:54.280]  Let me leave it at this, which is, Alex, they're going for our king.
[2:27:54.280 --> 2:27:56.040]  They're going to try to take out our king.
[2:27:56.040 --> 2:27:58.520]  And then they're coming after us after.
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:06.560]  But we know that Barack Obama's administration oversaw the wholesale unconstitutional wiretapping
[2:28:06.560 --> 2:28:10.920]  of millions of Americans, perhaps as many as millions.
[2:28:10.920 --> 2:28:12.960]  We must go for their king.
[2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:17.680]  I don't know what Jeff Sessions is waiting for, but he needs to impanel a grand jury for
[2:28:17.680 --> 2:28:22.040]  Ms. Rice, Valerie Jarrett, and yes, the president himself.
[2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:25.560]  What did Barack Obama know?
[2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:26.560]  And when did he know it?
[2:28:26.560 --> 2:28:27.560]  That's right.
[2:28:27.560 --> 2:28:31.280]  Trump has to go on total offense now, or they're going to kill him just like they do in the
[2:28:31.280 --> 2:28:32.280]  play.
[2:28:32.280 --> 2:28:33.440]  Killin' Julius Caesar.
[2:28:33.440 --> 2:28:34.440]  They're celebrating it.
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:35.440]  They're preparing it.
[2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:37.120]  And it's going to bring in a violent civil war.
[2:28:37.120 --> 2:28:38.120]  We must stop it.
[2:28:38.120 --> 2:28:40.840]  Thank you so much, Roger Stone.
[2:28:40.840 --> 2:28:41.840]  Great to be here.
[2:28:41.840 --> 2:28:42.840]  Many thanks, Alex.
[2:28:42.840 --> 2:28:43.840]  We've only got a minute 10 left.
[2:28:43.840 --> 2:28:49.720]  Of course, the final comment will be in touch with Roger and we'll figure out a date to get
[2:28:49.720 --> 2:28:50.720]  down to Austin.
[2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:51.720]  But here's the issue.
[2:28:51.720 --> 2:28:56.320]  You've got to look at this whole thing is that the deep state is planning an assassination.
[2:28:56.320 --> 2:29:04.040]  They're desensitizing the public with this assassination play with the Kathy Griffin beheading.
[2:29:04.040 --> 2:29:10.640]  Alex, you've got to be taken out or made to be seemed to be a Russian agent.
[2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:14.840]  And that's what Megyn Kelly's assignment was.
[2:29:14.840 --> 2:29:17.760]  You don't think she came on her own initiative.
[2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:18.760]  This is an assignment.
[2:29:18.760 --> 2:29:19.760]  This is deep state.
[2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:27.040]  This is the entire backing of the inner forces within the government that are opposing Donald
[2:29:27.040 --> 2:29:28.040]  Trump.
[2:29:28.040 --> 2:29:32.880]  But he better learn to use the power of the presidency now, fire Priebus, get rid of the
[2:29:32.880 --> 2:29:38.320]  Obama and Clinton carryovers, and start using the Department of Justice and the FBI to go
[2:29:38.320 --> 2:29:41.400]  in and execute order number 66.
[2:29:41.400 --> 2:29:42.400]  All right.
[2:29:42.400 --> 2:29:43.400]  Thank you so much, Dr. Corsi.
[2:29:43.400 --> 2:29:47.640]  We'll have our members of the crew in studio who face the Muslim hordes with the communists
[2:29:47.640 --> 2:29:48.640]  as they attack us.
[2:29:48.640 --> 2:29:55.920]  We're on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:29:55.920 --> 2:30:03.960]  More than two years ago, info wars first told you about our research into what has been
[2:30:03.960 --> 2:30:05.720]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[2:30:05.720 --> 2:30:10.080]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[2:30:10.080 --> 2:30:15.280]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[2:30:15.280 --> 2:30:19.040]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[2:30:19.040 --> 2:30:22.720]  They took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in.
[2:30:22.720 --> 2:30:27.280]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[2:30:27.280 --> 2:30:29.680]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[2:30:29.680 --> 2:30:35.160]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[2:30:35.160 --> 2:30:40.920]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[2:30:40.920 --> 2:30:42.520]  ever concerning iodine.
[2:30:42.520 --> 2:30:44.480]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.

[2:34:16.280 --> 2:34:23.280]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:34:23.280 --> 2:34:28.280]  And I'm very honored to be taking the main enemy attacks along with President Trump trying
[2:34:28.280 --> 2:34:31.280]  to destroy the Republic and our economy, turn back on and have religious freedom.
[2:34:31.280 --> 2:34:37.280]  Here's the deal, there's more than 60 Muslim countries and on average those Muslim countries
[2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:44.280]  are 95-plus percent, it's almost 96, anybody can look this up, percent Muslim.
[2:34:44.280 --> 2:34:45.280]  And you know why?
[2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:50.280]  A lot of them are 99.9 percent because they'll kill you, but if you're non-Muslim, in fact,
[2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:52.280]  if you're not Shiite or Sunni, they'll kill you.
[2:34:52.280 --> 2:34:54.280]  If it's a Shiite country, they'll kill you if you're Sunni.
[2:34:54.280 --> 2:34:56.280]  If it's a Sunni country, they'll kill you if you're Shiite.
[2:34:56.280 --> 2:35:01.280]  In fact, the Shiites on average are a little bit more tolerant than the Sunnis.
[2:35:01.280 --> 2:35:05.280]  Of course, it's Saudi Arabia and the Wahhabis and the Sunnis that are taken over.
[2:35:05.280 --> 2:35:09.280]  Our elites are publicly allied with them and take huge amounts of money from them.
[2:35:09.280 --> 2:35:15.280]  Brennan, former CIA director, converted to Wahhabism, lived in Saudi Arabia for over a decade.
[2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:23.280]  Mueller, of course, ruled the FBI under Obama and said that no one will call it radical Islam
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:25.280]  while he's there and took out all the training manuals.
[2:35:25.280 --> 2:35:28.280]  He said the real threat is returning veterans and gun owners.
[2:35:28.280 --> 2:35:30.280]  Those are in the actual manuals.
[2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:35.280]  That's why this is so devastating. It just came out about 15 minutes ago.
[2:35:35.280 --> 2:35:36.280]  It dovetails with lie.
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:40.280]  Owen Schreuer and Rob Do, our great reporters, are here in studio with us.
[2:35:40.280 --> 2:35:44.280]  The M4 Stanley News director and, of course, Owen Schreuer, both out on the ground in Austin
[2:35:44.280 --> 2:35:49.280]  at the anti-Sharia law demonstrations that happen globally, mainly by victims of Islam.
[2:35:49.280 --> 2:35:50.280]  A lot of diverse people.
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:53.280]  A lot of Africans have been killed or family members that have been killed.
[2:35:53.280 --> 2:35:55.280]  From Africa, we're actually out there.
[2:35:55.280 --> 2:36:01.280]  They know the fear. Indonesians, Indians from India, 1.4 million Indians.
[2:36:01.280 --> 2:36:05.280]  Excuse me, 148 million Indians, not 1.4.
[2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:10.280]  Gosh, that's a big number, but it's 140 million Hindus killed by our religion of love.
[2:36:10.280 --> 2:36:14.280]  Trump loses travel ban ruling in appeals court.
[2:36:14.280 --> 2:36:16.280]  And get ready for this.
[2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:21.280]  A second federal appeals court on Monday ruled against President Trump's revised travel ban.
[2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:23.280]  It's totally in law the president can do this.
[2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:27.280]  The decision from the United States Court of Appeals the night circuit in San Francisco,
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:31.280]  that's overturned 80 plus percent of the time, was the latest in a string of court rulings
[2:36:31.280 --> 2:36:36.280]  rejected by the administration's efforts to limit travel from several predominantly Muslim countries.
[2:36:36.280 --> 2:36:41.280]  Yes, failed states that don't even have working airports like Somalia continues.
[2:36:41.280 --> 2:36:44.280]  The administration has already sought a Supreme Court review.
[2:36:44.280 --> 2:36:48.280]  It's like saying, we take folks unvetted from caveman land.
[2:36:48.280 --> 2:36:52.280]  The administration has already sought a Supreme Court review of a similar decision issue last month.
[2:36:52.280 --> 2:36:56.280]  By the United States Court of Appeals for the fourth circuit in Virginia.
[2:36:56.280 --> 2:37:00.280]  The new ruling affirmed a March decision by Judge Derek K. Watson.
[2:37:00.280 --> 2:37:05.280]  From the federal court in Hawaii, Judge Watson blocked major parts of the revised order
[2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:10.280]  saying it violated the Constitution's ban on government establishment of religion.
[2:37:10.280 --> 2:37:15.280]  It says Congress shall make no law affecting the establishment of religion
[2:37:15.280 --> 2:37:19.280]  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or freedom of the press
[2:37:19.280 --> 2:37:23.280]  or the right to peaceably assemble or to petition the government for redress of grievances.
[2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:25.280]  That's the big number one, baby.
[2:37:25.280 --> 2:37:31.280]  It also says the Constitution, the president can control who comes in and who can't if they're not citizens.
[2:37:31.280 --> 2:37:33.280]  It's in the country, it's citizens.
[2:37:33.280 --> 2:37:36.280]  By the hope the Indians can take masculine, God bless them.
[2:37:36.280 --> 2:37:39.280]  You can't because it's illegal but it's part of their religion.
[2:37:39.280 --> 2:37:44.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about failed states where they sell women on slave blocks at auctions
[2:37:44.280 --> 2:37:48.280]  where they're selling tens of thousands of women and children a month out of Libya
[2:37:48.280 --> 2:37:50.280]  since our government overthrew it with Hillary.
[2:37:50.280 --> 2:37:52.280]  She came, she saw, he died.
[2:37:52.280 --> 2:37:58.280]  They are literally bringing in a group that wants to overtake any freedom of religion or not.
[2:37:58.280 --> 2:38:03.280]  Blow up little kids, shoot up gay nightclubs, throw people off buildings
[2:38:03.280 --> 2:38:07.280]  and they're saying because they have a right to religion,
[2:38:07.280 --> 2:38:11.280]  they have a right to come here with their murderous political Islam
[2:38:11.280 --> 2:38:15.280]  that says we will kill everybody that isn't part of our Islam
[2:38:15.280 --> 2:38:19.280]  from the most radical wait till there's more terror attacks.
[2:38:19.280 --> 2:38:23.280]  This is in and in the meanwhile this weekend all over the country throwing piss at people,
[2:38:23.280 --> 2:38:26.280]  beating them up, attacking my reporters, hitting them.
[2:38:26.280 --> 2:38:29.280]  The police would just come over and just stop them, wouldn't arrest them.
[2:38:29.280 --> 2:38:34.280]  This is incredible the tolerance while they say kill our president everywhere.
[2:38:34.280 --> 2:38:37.280]  My heavens, this is incredible. Gentlemen.
[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:41.280]  Well, and Alex, all these countries too, they found them in Libya, they found them in Syria
[2:38:41.280 --> 2:38:44.280]  where they're making their own passports, they're making fake passports to send these people.
[2:38:44.280 --> 2:38:46.280]  Because the airports are all bombed out hellhole.
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:49.280]  Exactly. So you have these failed people?
[2:38:49.280 --> 2:38:52.280]  Here, I am your Imam. You are good.
[2:38:52.280 --> 2:38:56.280]  G-O-O-D Habib. Habib, bye. Habibi.
[2:38:56.280 --> 2:39:00.280]  Here you go. Kill them infidel.
[2:39:00.280 --> 2:39:03.280]  It just makes you wonder what planet these people are on.
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:06.280]  You get passports here. Kill infidel.
[2:39:06.280 --> 2:39:08.280]  You get passports here. Kill them.
[2:39:08.280 --> 2:39:10.280]  But I'm blow up Manchester.
[2:39:10.280 --> 2:39:12.280]  But I'm 33. I'm 33 year old man.
[2:39:12.280 --> 2:39:16.280]  No, no. You're 16 year old, year old boy.
[2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:19.280]  Your name boy. Side name here.
[2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:20.280]  Thank you.
[2:39:20.280 --> 2:39:21.280]  Your name boy.
[2:39:21.280 --> 2:39:22.280]  Thank you.
[2:39:22.280 --> 2:39:23.280]  16.
[2:39:23.280 --> 2:39:26.280]  We love you Obama.
[2:39:26.280 --> 2:39:28.280]  Sorry.
[2:39:28.280 --> 2:39:30.280]  Don't be ridiculous.
[2:39:30.280 --> 2:39:33.280]  I mean, I can't believe this has gone through two of these.
[2:39:33.280 --> 2:39:35.280]  Wait, you need passports?
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:37.280]  Are these nice?
[2:39:37.280 --> 2:39:41.280]  We come to your country to get your women's coffer infidel.
[2:39:41.280 --> 2:39:43.280]  You want one?
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:46.280]  You with beard. You seven year old boy.
[2:39:46.280 --> 2:39:49.280]  Year old boy.
[2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:50.280]  Seven and a half.
[2:39:50.280 --> 2:39:51.280]  Seven and a half.
[2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:52.280]  Seven year old.
[2:39:52.280 --> 2:39:54.280]  Here you sign. Here's your passport.
[2:39:54.280 --> 2:39:55.280]  Signed by Imam.
[2:39:55.280 --> 2:39:56.280]  Can I get 20?
[2:39:56.280 --> 2:39:57.280]  Let me wipe ass in Islam.
[2:39:57.280 --> 2:39:59.280]  Here is your sentam.
[2:39:59.280 --> 2:40:00.280]  Sign name boy.
[2:40:00.280 --> 2:40:02.280]  Seven year old boy.
[2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:04.280]  With me and my 20 friends here.
[2:40:04.280 --> 2:40:05.280]  All 30 year old men.
[2:40:05.280 --> 2:40:07.280]  All five year old boy.
[2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:08.280]  I'm coming to the US.
[2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:12.280]  I think the proper response to this Alex is I guess Gallows humor.
[2:40:12.280 --> 2:40:17.280]  But how about the Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton comes out in response and says, you know what?
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:20.280]  The blood is on their hands.
[2:40:20.280 --> 2:40:24.280]  So now, and I already said this in a video in response to the.
[2:40:24.280 --> 2:40:26.280]  When there's a tax, it's not Islamic.
[2:40:26.280 --> 2:40:34.280]  Well, and keep in mind this is on the anniversary of Omar Mateen killing 49 people at a nightclub.
[2:40:34.280 --> 2:40:38.280]  Where he said, I'm doing this for ISIS, I'm doing this for Islam.
[2:40:38.280 --> 2:40:41.280]  I pledge allegiance to Allah who Akbar.
[2:40:41.280 --> 2:40:44.280]  And I believe it was his parents that migrated here from Afghanistan.
[2:40:44.280 --> 2:40:46.280]  If I'm recalling that correctly.
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:51.280]  But there's obviously a pattern here with the religion of peace as they're dubbing it.
[2:40:51.280 --> 2:41:02.280]  But this is what I think President Trump needs to do to pun fully intended Trump this travel ban restriction that the ninth court continues to bring upon and rename it.
[2:41:02.280 --> 2:41:06.280]  Countries America has bombed in the last eight years travel.
[2:41:06.280 --> 2:41:07.280]  That's your joke.
[2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:12.280]  We should ban on countries that legally have it under the law to kill gays.
[2:41:12.280 --> 2:41:13.280]  Okay.
[2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:14.280]  There you go.
[2:41:14.280 --> 2:41:17.280]  Ban countries where it's okay to kill homosexual travel ban.
[2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:18.280]  I like that too.
[2:41:18.280 --> 2:41:19.280]  But that's what I'm saying.
[2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:20.280]  You change the narrative.
[2:41:20.280 --> 2:41:24.280]  They'll say that's a violation of religion to because their religion is killing gays.
[2:41:24.280 --> 2:41:26.280]  So but then you.
[2:41:26.280 --> 2:41:33.280]  So there you go though, you make them say that you make them say that just like we go out.
[2:41:33.280 --> 2:41:36.280]  Rob do and I go out on Saturday and we don't even say anything.
[2:41:36.280 --> 2:41:41.280]  We're walking out of the camera and what does that do that makes them act like idiots that make.
[2:41:41.280 --> 2:41:45.280]  I mean words of literal people that because I watched a lot of this video where they act like mental patients.
[2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:46.280]  They look like.
[2:41:46.280 --> 2:41:47.280]  Describe what you saw.
[2:41:47.280 --> 2:41:48.280]  Well, do things.
[2:41:48.280 --> 2:41:50.280]  You call it larping.
[2:41:50.280 --> 2:41:51.280]  I call it larping.
[2:41:51.280 --> 2:41:56.280]  I call it larping. Yeah, I think they're live action role playing there for their planes and not all these people.
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:41:59.280]  Some of these people are violent a-holes, but some of a lot of these kids.
[2:41:59.280 --> 2:42:02.280]  They just want to get out there and scream because they're angry at whatever.
[2:42:02.280 --> 2:42:04.280]  They're angry because they have high interest loans.
[2:42:04.280 --> 2:42:06.280]  They're angry because they can't get a job.
[2:42:06.280 --> 2:42:07.280]  They're angry at themselves.
[2:42:07.280 --> 2:42:13.280]  All I know is I've been run over by police for no reason at demonstrations and their police are very nice.
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:15.280]  They're hitting cops with clubs, man.
[2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:17.280]  Let me tell you one of these people hit me with a club.
[2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:18.280]  That's why I can't go to these events.
[2:42:18.280 --> 2:42:22.280]  Some guy hits me with a hickory stick, a axe handle.
[2:42:22.280 --> 2:42:23.280]  That's a deadly weapon.
[2:42:23.280 --> 2:42:25.280]  I'm going to beat the hell out of them.
[2:42:25.280 --> 2:42:29.280]  Why did the cops not attack them when they're hitting them with clubs?
[2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:31.280]  Well, that's a funny thing because they can actually think.
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:35.280]  I would say us for that alternative media because we kept the police check.
[2:42:35.280 --> 2:42:37.280]  The police ate in check.
[2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:38.280]  We reported on the.
[2:42:38.280 --> 2:42:39.280]  What do you mean?
[2:42:39.280 --> 2:42:41.280]  It's the left terrorist always bringing the police.
[2:42:41.280 --> 2:42:42.280]  But here's what I'm saying.
[2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:47.280]  When those guys hit somebody with a deadly weapon, they need to get their ribs broken.
[2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:50.280]  The police should have beat the living hell out of these people.
[2:42:50.280 --> 2:42:55.280]  They're out there beating up innocent men, women and children and messing up our First Amendment.
[2:42:55.280 --> 2:42:56.280]  So that's what I'm saying.
[2:42:56.280 --> 2:42:57.280]  I'm going to the next one.
[2:42:57.280 --> 2:42:58.280]  That's it.
[2:42:58.280 --> 2:43:01.280]  When you see something like Kelly Thomas getting abused by police, you say, OK, that is wrong.
[2:43:01.280 --> 2:43:03.280]  The police were in the wrong there.
[2:43:03.280 --> 2:43:05.280]  This is an instance where you have violent.
[2:43:05.280 --> 2:43:08.280]  Back it up where they're attacking the cops and axe handles.
[2:43:08.280 --> 2:43:09.280]  Literally mass.
[2:43:09.280 --> 2:43:11.280]  They mass their faces.
[2:43:11.280 --> 2:43:12.280]  That shouldn't be legal.
[2:43:12.280 --> 2:43:16.280]  You're out here with your face mask because you want to break the law and get away with it.
[2:43:16.280 --> 2:43:18.280]  And that should be considered illegal.
[2:43:18.280 --> 2:43:19.280]  I completely agree.
[2:43:19.280 --> 2:43:23.280]  If I was the police officers, I don't think I would have had the same patients I had as a journalist.
[2:43:23.280 --> 2:43:26.280]  We need to go back to the footage of them hitting them with clubs and hitting.
[2:43:26.280 --> 2:43:27.280]  You guys got hit.
[2:43:27.280 --> 2:43:28.280]  Yeah.
[2:43:28.280 --> 2:43:31.280]  I mean, what is it like to have a bunch of beta snot nose idiots hitting you?
[2:43:31.280 --> 2:43:33.280]  I mean, just the scum of the earth.
[2:43:33.280 --> 2:43:34.280]  I literally had a four foot tall.
[2:43:34.280 --> 2:43:36.280]  I think she was female.
[2:43:36.280 --> 2:43:40.280]  She was bumping me and rubbing her granola bar on me and like bumping me like this.
[2:43:40.280 --> 2:43:41.280]  I said, are you serious?
[2:43:41.280 --> 2:43:44.280]  Are you really trying to intimidate me?
[2:43:44.280 --> 2:43:46.280]  I'm totally not going to intimidate anybody.
[2:43:46.280 --> 2:43:48.280]  They're going to rub the granola bar on you like that.
[2:43:48.280 --> 2:43:49.280]  It's just ridiculous.
[2:43:49.280 --> 2:43:53.280]  And that was just one of the one of the few people getting in my face screaming constantly.
[2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:55.280]  The screaming and whistle blowing.
[2:43:55.280 --> 2:43:56.280]  These people have no argument.
[2:43:56.280 --> 2:43:57.280]  They have no argument.
[2:43:57.280 --> 2:43:59.280]  They have no idea what they stand for.
[2:43:59.280 --> 2:44:02.280]  So it's scream, cuss you out, put the camera, block your camera.
[2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:07.280]  I don't know if you saw the video of the tranny getting in this black guy's face in California over the weekend.
[2:44:07.280 --> 2:44:09.280]  Got in his face screaming at the guy over and over again.
[2:44:09.280 --> 2:44:15.280]  Finally, she hit whatever hit him and the guy's like, that's all you got and pounded her it in the ground.
[2:44:15.280 --> 2:44:18.280]  It was kind of funny to watch because you sit there and you mess with people.
[2:44:18.280 --> 2:44:19.280]  You deserve what you get.
[2:44:19.280 --> 2:44:23.280]  You can't continue to mess with people and pretend like you could keep doing it.
[2:44:23.280 --> 2:44:24.280]  And eventually nobody's going to do anything.
[2:44:24.280 --> 2:44:29.280]  No, eventually you're going to, you're going to run into the wrong person just like that person did.
[2:44:29.280 --> 2:44:33.280]  I'm a non, non violent person, but I tell you what, you come and hit me with anything too.
[2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:38.280]  You're going to be, you're going to be going on with the footage of them hitting cops with axe handle.
[2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:40.280]  You can kill somebody with that.
[2:44:40.280 --> 2:44:45.280]  I mean, granted, they're a bunch of like mutant chicken necks, but I mean, still they're with axe handles, man.
[2:44:45.280 --> 2:44:49.280]  No, the police acted with restraint to an extreme degree.
[2:44:49.280 --> 2:44:50.280]  Well, you know why?
[2:44:50.280 --> 2:44:56.280]  Because they had the communists over there with their AK-47s, which again, they want to pan our guns, but they're going to have theirs.
[2:44:56.280 --> 2:44:59.280]  You know, that's an interesting point that you would bring up.
[2:44:59.280 --> 2:45:05.280]  If we came to an event like that and we had AKs over our shoulder, leftist media would be freaking out.
[2:45:05.280 --> 2:45:07.280]  They were holding the guns ready to go.
[2:45:07.280 --> 2:45:10.280]  Yeah, we, I thought they were menacing people.
[2:45:10.280 --> 2:45:13.280]  Well, Alex, again, they have their faces covered.
[2:45:13.280 --> 2:45:18.280]  They have their faces covered in cities that abandoned even though they're violating state law.
[2:45:18.280 --> 2:45:19.280]  We did it respectfully.
[2:45:19.280 --> 2:45:22.280]  We tell the cops were coming and we, and we don't aim guns at people.
[2:45:22.280 --> 2:45:25.280]  And we had people telling me, I caught it on video.
[2:45:25.280 --> 2:45:26.280]  I documented the people.
[2:45:26.280 --> 2:45:30.280]  They have the new Black Panther party marching around saying kill cops, man.
[2:45:30.280 --> 2:45:33.280]  You got a gun with your finger on the trigger saying kill people.
[2:45:33.280 --> 2:45:35.280]  I say they need to go to prison.
[2:45:35.280 --> 2:45:36.280]  Well, they need to be arrested.
[2:45:36.280 --> 2:45:40.280]  They're trying to cause a civil war just like Ukraine or the Arab Spring.
[2:45:40.280 --> 2:45:41.280]  We cannot put up with it.
[2:45:41.280 --> 2:45:42.280]  They really are.
[2:45:42.280 --> 2:45:45.280]  Attorney General needs to start arresting their asses now.
[2:45:45.280 --> 2:45:47.280]  Well, look what happened in Russia recently.
[2:45:47.280 --> 2:45:49.280]  George Soros paid protesters, took to the streets.
[2:45:49.280 --> 2:45:50.280]  And you know what happened?
[2:45:50.280 --> 2:45:51.280]  They got arrested in mass.
[2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:52.280]  Okay.
[2:45:52.280 --> 2:45:55.280]  The police in Russia didn't put up with it and they arrested them in mass.
[2:45:55.280 --> 2:45:56.280]  Because they were funded by Soros.
[2:45:56.280 --> 2:45:57.280]  Yeah.
[2:45:57.280 --> 2:46:00.280]  There's the people holding their AK-47 with their finger on the trigger.
[2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:01.280]  Yeah.
[2:46:01.280 --> 2:46:05.280]  So until these people start getting arrested in mass, until these people literally start getting their blood on the streets,
[2:46:05.280 --> 2:46:08.280]  by these police officers, they're going to keep doing it.
[2:46:08.280 --> 2:46:09.280]  They're going to keep doing it.
[2:46:09.280 --> 2:46:10.280]  They're going to knock down their throat, man.
[2:46:10.280 --> 2:46:11.280]  I don't want to do it.
[2:46:11.280 --> 2:46:12.280]  I don't look.
[2:46:12.280 --> 2:46:13.280]  There's some guy that comes up to me.
[2:46:13.280 --> 2:46:14.280]  I'm not violent either.
[2:46:14.280 --> 2:46:16.280]  They're a bunch of violent thugs trying to overthrow our country.
[2:46:16.280 --> 2:46:17.280]  I've always been Mr. Peace.
[2:46:17.280 --> 2:46:18.280]  These people are out of control.
[2:46:18.280 --> 2:46:27.280]  What are you supposed to do when being kind, a mental midget comes up to you with a plastic bongo drum and a ping pong paddle?
[2:46:27.280 --> 2:46:28.280]  There's being in your face.
[2:46:28.280 --> 2:46:29.280]  Okay.
[2:46:29.280 --> 2:46:30.280]  Have you ever heard of such nonsense?
[2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:33.280]  This is apparently an adult man who shows up at this event.
[2:46:33.280 --> 2:46:34.280]  These people are adults.
[2:46:34.280 --> 2:46:35.280]  It's a rest of development.
[2:46:35.280 --> 2:46:37.280]  They are young children in their minds.
[2:46:37.280 --> 2:46:38.280]  They have not had to grow up.
[2:46:38.280 --> 2:46:40.280]  They've had everything handed to them.
[2:46:40.280 --> 2:46:41.280]  They've had helicopter parents.
[2:46:41.280 --> 2:46:43.280]  They get participation medals.
[2:46:43.280 --> 2:46:44.280]  And this is what you get.
[2:46:44.280 --> 2:46:45.280]  This is a fallout of it.
[2:46:45.280 --> 2:46:46.280]  You get a bunch of bratty kids.
[2:46:46.280 --> 2:46:50.280]  Now, Alex, I talked to one of the founding members of Oath Keepers on Saturday.
[2:46:50.280 --> 2:46:51.280]  Look at that.
[2:46:51.280 --> 2:46:53.280]  The guy hit him and then it gets taken out.
[2:46:53.280 --> 2:46:54.280]  He said a civil war is imminent.
[2:46:54.280 --> 2:46:56.280]  He said, these guys are going to cause a civil war.
[2:46:56.280 --> 2:46:58.280]  And people are like, get off her.
[2:46:58.280 --> 2:46:59.280]  Get off her.
[2:46:59.280 --> 2:47:00.280]  Well, they weren't doing anything.
[2:47:00.280 --> 2:47:04.280]  It was that tranny goes up to a black Trump supporter, punches him in the face.
[2:47:04.280 --> 2:47:05.280]  What do you think is going to happen?
[2:47:05.280 --> 2:47:06.280]  And then look at all that.
[2:47:06.280 --> 2:47:08.280]  I said that to all these guys.
[2:47:08.280 --> 2:47:14.280]  After the one guy tried to shove his little plastic bongo in my face, I retweeted the
[2:47:14.280 --> 2:47:15.280]  video.
[2:47:15.280 --> 2:47:18.280]  I'm like, I could literally drop every single one of you clowns.
[2:47:18.280 --> 2:47:19.280]  That's how pathetic they are.
[2:47:19.280 --> 2:47:20.280]  I feel bad.
[2:47:20.280 --> 2:47:21.280]  I feel bad.
[2:47:21.280 --> 2:47:22.280]  How's your arm?
[2:47:22.280 --> 2:47:23.280]  I'm sorry.
[2:47:23.280 --> 2:47:27.280]  No, but I mean, honestly, it's like what you're saying.
[2:47:27.280 --> 2:47:30.400]  I mean, these people are, they have mental illnesses.
[2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:32.560]  They are in the rest of development.
[2:47:32.560 --> 2:47:34.280]  Part of me feels bad for them.
[2:47:34.280 --> 2:47:36.960]  But the other part of the show, they're not allowed to go over through our country for
[2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:37.960]  Sharia law.
[2:47:37.960 --> 2:47:42.360]  Well, that's a full multiracial crowd against Sharia law, which is literally like being
[2:47:42.360 --> 2:47:43.360]  against Nazism.
[2:47:43.360 --> 2:47:45.680]  And they're over there attacking the men, women and children.
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:46.680]  That's the footage I saw.
[2:47:46.680 --> 2:47:50.680]  I saw only one real debate and it was one guy saying, well, it's not, the, the general
[2:47:50.680 --> 2:47:52.440]  mutilation is not happening in Texas.
[2:47:52.440 --> 2:47:53.440]  It'll never happen in Texas.
[2:47:53.440 --> 2:47:54.440]  I'm like, buddy.
[2:47:54.440 --> 2:47:55.440]  It's already started.
[2:47:55.440 --> 2:47:58.160]  And once it starts in one area, it just moves around.
[2:47:58.160 --> 2:48:00.320]  And we don't even know if it's happening in Texas right now.
[2:48:00.320 --> 2:48:04.200]  We didn't know Kermit Gosnell was cutting the heads off of babies with scissors after
[2:48:04.200 --> 2:48:06.640]  they were born until years after it happened.
[2:48:06.640 --> 2:48:09.280]  So you're not going to know this stuff until it actually happens.
[2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:13.800]  There needs to be investigators into all these radical orthodox Islam is not compatible
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:15.560]  in the civilized world.
[2:48:15.560 --> 2:48:18.840]  What are the elite doing importing millions of these crew balls?
[2:48:18.840 --> 2:48:20.160]  They want to start a civil war.
[2:48:20.160 --> 2:48:21.160]  That's exactly it.
[2:48:21.160 --> 2:48:25.160]  And, and Antifa doesn't realize that they're going to be the ones that they are the ones
[2:48:25.160 --> 2:48:28.240]  who are going to die because they are going to be on the front lines and they're going
[2:48:28.240 --> 2:48:29.240]  to get wasted.
[2:48:29.240 --> 2:48:32.880]  I mean, it's not, it's not what any of us want.
[2:48:32.880 --> 2:48:33.880]  It's not what we're calling for.
[2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:38.280]  We're calling for the opposite, but it just goes to show you how mindless these people
[2:48:38.280 --> 2:48:42.520]  are when you see these videos and you just think, just think about a strain of, think
[2:48:42.520 --> 2:48:48.800]  about a train of thought where you're out here protesting basically for Sharia law.
[2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:53.240]  You're stopping a anti Sharia law protest, which Sharia law oppresses women.
[2:48:53.240 --> 2:48:55.680]  And by the way, they're screaming the whole time.
[2:48:55.680 --> 2:48:57.920]  Don't stop my free speech while they're hitting.
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:01.920]  And these are the same people that cried for months about Donald Trump's grab her by the
[2:49:01.920 --> 2:49:03.320]  private part comment.
[2:49:03.320 --> 2:49:08.440]  So you can't make a comment in a private conversation, jokingly about how you're a billionaire and
[2:49:08.440 --> 2:49:11.800]  women just basically put themselves on top of you.
[2:49:11.800 --> 2:49:18.600]  You're not allowed to talk about that, but it's okay to have Sharia law, which oppresses
[2:49:18.600 --> 2:49:20.600]  women and supports female.
[2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:23.760]  Like goats, remember that one where they're guys with the stick hurting the little girls
[2:49:23.760 --> 2:49:24.760]  like goats?
[2:49:24.760 --> 2:49:25.760]  That's how they treat them.
[2:49:25.760 --> 2:49:27.280]  They treat them like, and they treat women like animals.
[2:49:27.280 --> 2:49:30.440]  I'm beginning to wonder, what do you think would happen though?
[2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:35.160]  If like that, the guy who, the guy who got into it with that tranny, I mean, he dropped
[2:49:35.160 --> 2:49:37.640]  that tranny like nothing, I'm wondering, do you think he got arrested?
[2:49:37.640 --> 2:49:41.240]  I'm wondering, if we started responding to these people, do you think the police would
[2:49:41.240 --> 2:49:42.240]  arrest us?
[2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:45.600]  If I decided to just, okay, you know what buddy, pop, now he's on the ground.
[2:49:45.600 --> 2:49:47.280]  Is the officer going to arrest me?
[2:49:47.280 --> 2:49:50.480]  So there's another weird dynamic because people are not, I'm not, that's probably, that's
[2:49:50.480 --> 2:49:51.480]  not going to be me.
[2:49:51.480 --> 2:49:54.520]  Like I said, I'm a peaceful guy and I'm out there as a journalist, but there's other people
[2:49:54.520 --> 2:49:56.640]  that are not going to take this anymore, Alex.
[2:49:56.640 --> 2:50:00.280]  And someone is going to get their block knocked off.
[2:50:00.280 --> 2:50:01.280]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:02.280]  That's why I'm glad.
[2:50:02.280 --> 2:50:03.800]  I can't imagine if it was you out there, Alex.
[2:50:03.800 --> 2:50:04.800]  I'm not that tough.
[2:50:04.800 --> 2:50:05.800]  No, I'm not even saying that.
[2:50:05.800 --> 2:50:06.800]  I'm just saying that.
[2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:09.800]  They were complaining because they hit me on the elbow and back or punch him.
[2:50:09.800 --> 2:50:12.000]  I'm just going, hey, you just hit me, I'm like, dude, you just hit me.
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:13.800]  They do that thing where they won't come and bump you.
[2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:14.800]  It's like, oh, we're going to bump you.
[2:50:14.800 --> 2:50:15.800]  Oh, we're going to bump you.
[2:50:15.800 --> 2:50:16.800]  They did it to you.
[2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:17.800]  Oh yeah.
[2:50:17.800 --> 2:50:21.840]  Trump rally, a Trump rally protest, I'm just saying, if I get the attention that I get
[2:50:21.840 --> 2:50:24.120]  when I get out there, I couldn't imagine what they would do to you.
[2:50:24.120 --> 2:50:25.600]  They'd probably start throwing things at you.
[2:50:25.600 --> 2:50:26.600]  Well, you heard it.
[2:50:26.600 --> 2:50:27.600]  Like Lawrence Southern.
[2:50:27.600 --> 2:50:28.600]  Alex Jones.
[2:50:28.600 --> 2:50:29.600]  F-Alch.
[2:50:29.600 --> 2:50:30.600]  Oh, and oh.
[2:50:30.600 --> 2:50:31.600]  Most of it was about you.
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:32.600]  Well, tell your boss.
[2:50:32.600 --> 2:50:33.600]  Tell your boss.
[2:50:33.600 --> 2:50:34.600]  Alex, they fall for the fake news.
[2:50:34.600 --> 2:50:37.400]  I don't even want to say this because I don't want to get any credence to the, credence
[2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:41.400]  to the story, but they literally fall for entire fake news saying, oh, what about Alex's
[2:50:41.400 --> 2:50:42.400]  kids?
[2:50:42.400 --> 2:50:43.400]  I'm like, Alex's kids love him.
[2:50:43.400 --> 2:50:44.400]  He's in a happy family with them.
[2:50:44.400 --> 2:50:45.400]  I just saw him.
[2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:46.400]  They're like, yeah, he lost him.
[2:50:46.400 --> 2:50:50.400]  He's literally, they literally fall for fake news if they can't believe the media matters.
[2:50:50.400 --> 2:50:51.400]  No, they believe mainstream media.
[2:50:51.400 --> 2:50:52.400]  They believe mainstream media.
[2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:53.400]  Totally wrong.
[2:50:53.400 --> 2:50:55.040]  Alex's kids are fine.
[2:50:55.040 --> 2:50:56.040]  Trust me.
[2:50:56.040 --> 2:50:57.040]  I just saw him.
[2:50:57.040 --> 2:50:58.600]  Well, I mean, but they're only with me six days a week, so.
[2:50:58.600 --> 2:50:59.600]  Oh, so the media.
[2:50:59.600 --> 2:51:03.800]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[2:51:03.800 --> 2:51:07.400]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and
[2:51:07.400 --> 2:51:11.920]  vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[2:51:11.920 --> 2:51:14.920]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[2:51:14.920 --> 2:51:18.800]  Know you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors.
[2:51:18.800 --> 2:51:21.640]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[2:51:21.640 --> 2:51:25.800]  It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[2:51:25.800 --> 2:51:29.920]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[2:51:29.920 --> 2:51:35.200]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[2:51:35.200 --> 2:51:39.720]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long lasting
[2:51:39.720 --> 2:51:41.000]  food on hand.
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:44.360]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[2:51:44.360 --> 2:51:46.080]  We love our freeze dryer.
[2:51:46.080 --> 2:51:52.480]  To learn more, go to HarvestRight.com or call 800-923-9591.
[2:51:52.480 --> 2:51:58.760]  That's HarvestRight.com or 800-923-9591.
[2:51:58.760 --> 2:52:03.120]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[2:52:03.120 --> 2:52:07.800]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[2:52:07.800 --> 2:52:09.320]  to detoxify the body.
[2:52:09.320 --> 2:52:14.160]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[2:52:14.160 --> 2:52:15.720]  It's made in the USA.
[2:52:15.720 --> 2:52:20.600]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[2:52:20.600 --> 2:52:22.440]  the body and it supports the info war.
[2:52:22.440 --> 2:52:24.680]  It is a classical 360 win.
[2:52:24.680 --> 2:52:29.160]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[2:52:29.160 --> 2:52:33.760]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[2:52:33.760 --> 2:52:34.760]  get.
[2:52:34.760 --> 2:52:38.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:48.200]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[2:52:48.200 --> 2:52:50.840]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[2:52:50.840 --> 2:52:54.160]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[2:52:54.160 --> 2:52:58.720]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and infowarslife.com.

[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:07.320]  by you, but the symptoms are there.
[2:53:07.320 --> 2:53:12.400]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are

[2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:25.600]  dead and they want to shut down all the free speech in this country and they are just after
[2:54:25.600 --> 2:54:27.760]  all of us, they are so despicable.

[2:56:02.680 --> 2:56:06.440]  Let's go to Steven in Florida, you've been holding like a trooper, go ahead.
[2:56:06.440 --> 2:56:12.200]  Yeah, hey, good afternoon Allison and Rob, first of all Alex, I want to say before I
[2:56:12.200 --> 2:56:17.120]  get to what I called in about which is this Comey situation, you know, I've been listening
[2:56:17.120 --> 2:56:24.360]  to you for years and I want to thank you because, you know, I've discovered so many good products
[2:56:24.360 --> 2:56:29.920]  through your advertising on your show, first of all beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0, that is
[2:56:29.920 --> 2:56:35.120]  my number one supplement that I take and I can tell a difference when I run out.
[2:56:35.120 --> 2:56:40.000]  Oh yeah, that's m4steam.com, their products great, our vitamin mineral fusion is similar
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:41.800]  but they're both excellent products.
[2:56:41.800 --> 2:56:49.960]  Right, and you know, I've got an X2, SuperMail, Secret 12, Pawprostigard, BioTrue Selenium,
[2:56:49.960 --> 2:56:57.440]  BioDefense, Mycosiax, Axipowder, Livershield, Lung Clans, the Super Blue Toothpaste is
[2:56:57.440 --> 2:57:05.840]  the best toothpaste I've ever used, Caveman, Brainforce, Deep Clans, SilverBullet and Knockup,
[2:57:05.840 --> 2:57:11.760]  and I've also got the Alexa Pure Water Filter system that I can't live without and the Pro
[2:57:11.760 --> 2:57:17.480]  Pure Water shower filtration system and it's all excellent.
[2:57:17.480 --> 2:57:21.280]  And are you a repeat user too, Steven, do you repeat buying these things?
[2:57:21.280 --> 2:57:25.840]  Oh yeah, I get, you know, as I can, as I can afford it, I get auto shifts.
[2:57:25.840 --> 2:57:28.600]  What is your favorite product of all of them?
[2:57:28.600 --> 2:57:38.120]  My go-to product, you know, I take basically the SuperMail and the X2 and the Secret 12
[2:57:38.120 --> 2:57:44.240]  every day, but my go-to product has been the SilverBullet, man.
[2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:50.000]  I had the blue really bad when it was going around back in late February, early March and
[2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:54.560]  I don't get sick much, I'm generally really healthy, but I'll tell you, I got it bad.
[2:57:54.560 --> 2:58:00.160]  All I did was I took almost a bottle of the SilverBullet and I had my vitamin C and in
[2:58:00.160 --> 2:58:01.160]  a week it was gone.
[2:58:01.160 --> 2:58:02.160]  I took no antibiotics, nothing else.
[2:58:02.160 --> 2:58:07.360]  Sure, and I can't say it replaces antibiotics, antibiotics, but working sometimes is only
[2:58:07.360 --> 2:58:08.360]  a physician.
[2:58:08.360 --> 2:58:10.440]  It's just antibiotics have quit working for me with sore throats and I'll just drink
[2:58:10.440 --> 2:58:11.680]  a whole bottle of cold silver.
[2:58:11.680 --> 2:58:14.160]  Now technically that's probably a little bit of a toxic level, I'm not saying you should
[2:58:14.160 --> 2:58:17.400]  do that, but it definitely is silver, it's a fact.
[2:58:17.400 --> 2:58:21.720]  But now you see silver being sold in stores, I mean, hospitals are using it, I mean.
[2:58:21.720 --> 2:58:26.000]  They put silver in like plastic bags and things that people, you know, Tupperware now, they're
[2:58:26.000 --> 2:58:28.960]  impregnating it with silver to keep stuff to last longer.
[2:58:28.960 --> 2:58:31.640]  They make it, it helps make fruit last longer, vegetables, it's amazing.
[2:58:31.640 --> 2:58:32.640]  We beat them to that.
[2:58:32.640 --> 2:58:33.640]  Silver is great.
[2:58:33.640 --> 2:58:35.800]  We beat them to the DNA force, we beat them with the iodine.
[2:58:35.800 --> 2:58:36.800]  Yeah.
[2:58:36.800 --> 2:58:37.800]  You're awesome, Steven, you're awesome.
[2:58:37.800 --> 2:58:38.800]  I need to call them about coming hearings.
[2:58:38.800 --> 2:58:39.800]  Thank you.
[2:58:39.800 --> 2:58:40.800]  Stay there, I'm gonna come right back to you.
[2:58:40.800 --> 2:58:41.800]  We're going into fourth hour.
[2:58:41.800 --> 2:58:42.800]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:42.800 --> 2:58:54.720]  Over the weekend, Act for America held human rights marches across the United States, marching
[2:58:54.720 --> 2:58:59.080]  against Sharia law, which prohibits certain human rights to women and countries where
[2:58:59.080 --> 2:59:01.600]  Sharia law is in practice oppress women.
[2:59:01.600 --> 2:59:05.800]  So leave it to Antifa to show up and disrupt these Americans first amendment right, but
[2:59:05.800 --> 2:59:07.200]  didn't stop there.
[2:59:07.200 --> 2:59:11.080]  Journalists like myself got assaulted and cursed at just for documenting the event.
[2:59:11.080 --> 2:59:16.080]  Lauren Southern even had animal urine thrown at him while filming in the New York City
[2:59:16.080 --> 2:59:17.360]  march against Sharia.
[2:59:17.360 --> 2:59:19.880]  If it wasn't obvious before, it is now.
[2:59:19.880 --> 2:59:22.440]  CNN and Antifa are ISIS.
[2:59:22.440 --> 2:59:26.480]  Leftist freaked out when a burqa was put on Fearless Girl in New York City, faced with
[2:59:26.480 --> 2:59:29.160]  the imagery of the oppression they were supporting.
[2:59:29.160 --> 2:59:33.400]  The same people that are now supporting Sharia law in America were the same people who were
[2:59:33.400 --> 2:59:37.840]  so helplessly offended by Donald Trump's grab her by the private comment.
[2:59:37.840 --> 2:59:42.680]  So Trump's inappropriate private conversation is unacceptable, but forced female genital
[2:59:42.680 --> 2:59:44.440]  mutilation is okay.
[2:59:44.440 --> 2:59:46.720]  The left has literally lost their minds.
[2:59:46.720 --> 2:59:52.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Shroyer.
[2:59:52.000 --> 3:00:11.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:11.680 --> 3:00:16.080]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:16.080 --> 3:00:20.320]  All right, they're going to take calls and play clips during this hour.
[3:00:20.320 --> 3:00:22.440]  They're about to take over, Owen Shroyer.
[3:00:22.440 --> 3:00:23.440]  And of course, Rob Dew.
[3:00:23.440 --> 3:00:26.000]  I'm about to punch you out here in about five minutes, got a lot of important work behind
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  the scenes to do.
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:32.960]  We expand the Info War, contrary to all the mainstream media's lies, 877-789-Alex is the
[3:00:32.960 --> 3:00:36.440]  toll-free number to join us, 877-789-Alex.
[3:00:36.440 --> 3:00:44.400]  We were finishing up with a caller that's there at the bottom of the screen there, Stephen,
[3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:45.400]  in Florida.
[3:00:45.400 --> 3:00:46.400]  You're on the air.
[3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:47.400]  What was your point on the Comey hearings?
[3:00:47.400 --> 3:00:51.840]  Yeah, here's what I wanted to say, and you guys can see if you concur with my analysis.
[3:00:51.840 --> 3:00:52.840]  Okay.
[3:00:52.840 --> 3:00:57.920]  You know, Alex, you have very masterfully brought out what a false flag terror attack
[3:00:57.920 --> 3:01:04.280]  is in your terror storm documentary, and anyway, I haven't seen that need to get that and
[3:01:04.280 --> 3:01:05.280]  see it.
[3:01:05.280 --> 3:01:10.120]  But here's the thing, okay, the last successful false flag, I can see that the New World Order
[3:01:10.120 --> 3:01:16.920]  pulled off was through Hillary Clinton with Benghazi, and that was on September 11th.
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:21.360]  Well, what I see happening now is God's law of the harvest, where they're reaping what
[3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:25.480]  they've done, and Alex, you said, I'm willing to take the hit, you know, and you've been
[3:01:25.480 --> 3:01:29.720]  out there for years, you and Drudge and others, you know, putting out the hits on the New
[3:01:29.720 --> 3:01:30.720]  World Order.
[3:01:30.720 --> 3:01:37.120]  Well, now I think the roosters are coming home to roost with them because last year during
[3:01:37.120 --> 3:01:43.560]  the campaign here, September 11th, here, I think it was one of your reporters, videotaped
[3:01:43.560 --> 3:01:47.800]  Hillary falling down on September 11th was a message from God.
[3:01:47.800 --> 3:01:48.800]  It was.
[3:01:48.800 --> 3:01:49.800]  It was.
[3:01:49.800 --> 3:01:50.800]  That's right, folks.
[3:01:50.800 --> 3:01:52.080]  They don't have all the power.
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:55.320]  They wonder why we keep winning is because we got God on our side.
[3:01:55.320 --> 3:01:56.320]  Yeah.
[3:01:56.320 --> 3:01:57.320]  Here's what I want to say.
[3:01:57.320 --> 3:02:01.800]  With the Comey hearings now, what's coming across to me is these people see they wanted
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:07.800]  to pull the ultimate false flag, taking down the Trump administration, they've been off
[3:02:07.800 --> 3:02:13.160]  more than they can chew in the Comey fiasco, what it says to me is what they have done
[3:02:13.160 --> 3:02:17.840]  is without realizing it is pulled a false flag on themselves.
[3:02:17.840 --> 3:02:19.840]  They're going down.
[3:02:19.840 --> 3:02:20.840]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:02:20.840 --> 3:02:23.760]  I mean, I don't put a good face on things if it's not good.
[3:02:23.760 --> 3:02:27.480]  I admit when we're wrong, I admit when we're failing, I admit when the country's in trouble.
[3:02:27.480 --> 3:02:31.160]  Every real indicators were coming back from the dead culturally, economically, and the
[3:02:31.160 --> 3:02:32.560]  elite are panicking.
[3:02:32.560 --> 3:02:39.760]  The people that stole the country that hijacked it, that took over, you know, America by fraud,
[3:02:39.760 --> 3:02:43.760]  they're panicking, and Comey was devastated.
[3:02:43.760 --> 3:02:46.360]  He had to say, no, Trump never told me to stop investigation.
[3:02:46.360 --> 3:02:51.440]  No, I did tell Trump he wasn't under investigation confirming everything when he tried to use
[3:02:51.440 --> 3:02:53.440]  that sneaky fake memo.
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:55.240]  He was forced to admit it was him.
[3:02:55.240 --> 3:02:58.160]  It was a total reversal, but you tuned on CNN.
[3:02:58.160 --> 3:02:59.680]  You thought Trump got indicted.
[3:02:59.680 --> 3:03:01.760]  Well, and now he doesn't have the memos.
[3:03:01.760 --> 3:03:02.760]  Like where did they go?
[3:03:02.760 --> 3:03:04.360]  Were they not on your computer system?
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:05.360]  Like the FBI.
[3:03:05.360 --> 3:03:06.360]  Which he was supposed to give.
[3:03:06.360 --> 3:03:07.360]  Exactly.
[3:03:07.360 --> 3:03:08.360]  To the Justice Department.
[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:09.360]  Exactly.
[3:03:09.360 --> 3:03:10.520]  And he's like, oh, I don't have him.
[3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:11.920]  My buddy has him.
[3:03:11.920 --> 3:03:12.920]  What?
[3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:14.920]  Which by the way, that's a cop out, bro.
[3:03:14.920 --> 3:03:18.200]  Coming up in the next segment, Alex, you can, if you're still with us, you can hear
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:19.200]  this clip.
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:21.560]  The timing, they really did trap themselves.
[3:03:21.560 --> 3:03:27.720]  Stephen is right because the timing of the events and what Comey said in his testimony,
[3:03:27.720 --> 3:03:29.360]  do not actually add up.
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:37.400]  I've got a video from May 3rd, May 3rd, where James Comey says he did not ever leak anything
[3:03:37.400 --> 3:03:38.400]  to the media.
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:40.400]  Well, Tom Grassley asked him specifically.
[3:03:40.400 --> 3:03:41.400]  Wait a minute.
[3:03:41.400 --> 3:03:42.400]  And on May 3rd.
[3:03:42.400 --> 3:03:43.400]  Wait a minute.
[3:03:43.400 --> 3:03:44.400]  Wait a minute.
[3:03:44.400 --> 3:03:45.400]  Oh my God, it's more perjury.
[3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:46.400]  I want to stay on for this.
[3:03:46.400 --> 3:03:47.400]  I remember that.
[3:03:47.400 --> 3:03:48.400]  I'd forgotten it.
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:49.400]  Yep.
[3:03:49.400 --> 3:03:50.400]  You're such a genius.
[3:03:50.400 --> 3:03:53.080]  So Comey caught lying to the Senate about leaks.
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:03:54.080]  We have him.
[3:03:54.080 --> 3:03:55.080]  Twice now.
[3:03:55.080 --> 3:03:56.080]  It was a criminal.
[3:03:56.080 --> 3:03:57.080]  Twice.
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:04:01.840]  Because first he lied on May 3rd, then he said that he put out the memo to a reporter
[3:04:01.840 --> 3:04:06.080]  in response to Trump's tape tweet, but the tape tweet wasn't made till May 12.
[3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:07.080]  Let me stop you.
[3:04:07.080 --> 3:04:08.080]  Let me stop you.
[3:04:08.080 --> 3:04:09.280]  Don't let me stop you.
[3:04:09.280 --> 3:04:13.000]  Next time, like Matt came to me one day and he goes, you know, we have the clip of him
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:14.200]  saying nobody tried to influence him.
[3:04:14.200 --> 3:04:15.320]  I went, I forgot about that.
[3:04:15.320 --> 3:04:16.320]  Why didn't you tell me?
[3:04:16.320 --> 3:04:18.320]  I guess I am telling you.
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:19.320]  I just found it.
[3:04:19.320 --> 3:04:21.600]  And then that broke from us.
[3:04:21.600 --> 3:04:23.080]  You should have run in here earlier.
[3:04:23.080 --> 3:04:25.080]  When did you find this?
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:27.160]  Just today when I got in and came on the show.
[3:04:27.160 --> 3:04:28.160]  Okay.
[3:04:28.160 --> 3:04:29.160]  Next time you find that.
[3:04:29.160 --> 3:04:30.160]  Yes.
[3:04:30.160 --> 3:04:32.440]  Don't just say I know everything and I'm the boss.
[3:04:32.440 --> 3:04:33.840]  No, it's the opposite.
[3:04:33.840 --> 3:04:35.680]  You come in and you tell me what we're about to do.
[3:04:35.680 --> 3:04:36.680]  When we come back.
[3:04:36.680 --> 3:04:37.680]  Oh, you run this.
[3:04:37.680 --> 3:04:38.680]  Well, they have the clips.
[3:04:38.680 --> 3:04:39.680]  Yes.
[3:04:39.680 --> 3:04:40.680]  They have the clips.
[3:04:40.680 --> 3:04:41.680]  All right.
[3:04:41.680 --> 3:04:42.680]  Drum roll.
[3:04:42.680 --> 3:04:43.680]  Everybody tune in.
[3:04:43.680 --> 3:04:44.680]  Steve and God bless you.
[3:04:44.680 --> 3:04:45.680]  Thanks for the sport.
[3:04:45.680 --> 3:04:46.680]  Brother.
[3:04:46.680 --> 3:04:47.680]  Love you.
[3:04:47.680 --> 3:04:48.680]  We're going to come back and we're going to break down another giant lie.
[3:04:48.680 --> 3:04:49.680]  Comey got caught in.
[3:04:49.680 --> 3:04:50.680]  This is.
[3:04:50.680 --> 3:04:51.680]  Start tweeting it.
[3:04:51.680 --> 3:04:52.680]  Start.
[3:04:52.680 --> 3:04:53.680]  Grab.
[3:04:53.680 --> 3:04:54.680]  Grab this clip as soon as we're done.
[3:04:54.680 --> 3:04:55.680]  It's taping it.
[3:04:55.680 --> 3:04:56.680]  Live.
[3:04:56.680 --> 3:04:57.680]  I want to get this out everywhere.
[3:04:57.680 --> 3:04:58.680]  This is mega huge.
[3:04:58.680 --> 3:04:59.680]  Stay with us.
[3:04:59.680 --> 3:05:02.360]  The collapse of the left continues.
[3:05:02.360 --> 3:05:06.040]  If it isn't Maxine Waters or Nancy Pelosi having a mental breakdown.
[3:05:06.040 --> 3:05:09.280]  If it isn't Snoop Doggity Dog pretending to shoot President Trump.
[3:05:09.280 --> 3:05:13.600]  If it isn't Kathy Griffin going full Isis and depicting herself with a decapitated
[3:05:13.600 --> 3:05:14.600]  trumpet.
[3:05:14.600 --> 3:05:18.360]  It's the New York public theater depicting the assassination of President Trump in their
[3:05:18.360 --> 3:05:20.760]  latest installment of Shakespeare in the Park.
[3:05:20.760 --> 3:05:25.320]  The play depicted President Trump as the modern day Julius Caesar, this time being stabbed
[3:05:25.320 --> 3:05:29.000]  to death by minorities and women, a clear subliminal message.
[3:05:29.000 --> 3:05:35.280]  Leave it to CNN to endorse such an atrocity as Fareed Zakaria said the play is a masterpiece.
[3:05:35.280 --> 3:05:40.040]  The disturbing presentation did not go without consequences as major sponsors of the theater
[3:05:40.040 --> 3:05:45.040]  have now pulled their sponsorship dollars, such as Delta Airlines and Bank of America
[3:05:45.040 --> 3:05:48.880]  who have supported the theater to the tunes of millions in the past.
[3:05:48.880 --> 3:05:52.600]  The suicide of the left is real for info wars.com.
[3:05:52.600 --> 3:05:59.160]  This is Owen shroyer.
[3:05:59.160 --> 3:06:00.280]  It's not just our water.
[3:06:00.280 --> 3:06:01.280]  We need to filter.
[3:06:01.280 --> 3:06:03.040]  It's not just our food that needs to be clean.
[3:06:03.040 --> 3:06:05.240]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our people.
[3:06:05.240 --> 3:06:10.760]  Our children, the artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down
[3:06:10.760 --> 3:06:11.960]  our immune systems.
[3:06:11.960 --> 3:06:16.920]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[3:06:16.920 --> 3:06:21.880]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze, whether it's your home
[3:06:21.880 --> 3:06:22.880]  or office.
[3:06:22.880 --> 3:06:27.120]  You owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children to the best job you
[3:06:27.120 --> 3:06:28.720]  can to purify your air.
[3:06:28.720 --> 3:06:33.720]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[3:06:33.720 --> 3:06:36.760]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[3:06:36.760 --> 3:06:38.960]  The general public doesn't.
[3:06:38.960 --> 3:06:42.920]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[3:06:42.920 --> 3:06:46.520]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[3:06:46.520 --> 3:06:50.080]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[3:06:50.080 --> 3:06:53.280]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[3:06:53.280 --> 3:06:59.360]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today in infowarstore.com.
[3:06:59.360 --> 3:07:03.760]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[3:07:03.760 --> 3:07:08.460]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:07:08.460 --> 3:07:09.960]  to detoxify the body.
[3:07:09.960 --> 3:07:12.320]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[3:07:12.320 --> 3:07:14.840]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[3:07:14.840 --> 3:07:16.360]  It's made in the USA.
[3:07:16.360 --> 3:07:21.280]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[3:07:21.280 --> 3:07:23.120]  the body and it supports the info war.
[3:07:23.120 --> 3:07:25.360]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:07:25.360 --> 3:07:28.920]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[3:07:28.920 --> 3:07:33.840]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[3:07:33.840 --> 3:07:34.840]  you can possibly get.
[3:07:34.840 --> 3:07:38.760]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[3:07:38.760 --> 3:07:43.800]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[3:07:43.800 --> 3:07:49.040]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[3:07:49.040 --> 3:07:51.680]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[3:07:51.680 --> 3:07:55.040]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[3:07:55.040 --> 3:08:02.040]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield InfoWarsLive.com.
[2:51:37.980 --> 3:08:42.160]  Alex Jones here with Owen Schroger and Rob Do.
[3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:45.480]  We have massive breaking news.
[3:08:45.480 --> 3:08:46.600]  This is hiding in plain view.
[3:08:46.600 --> 3:08:53.440]  This has not gotten any attention yet to Time Magazine's credit.
[3:08:53.440 --> 3:08:57.960]  They actually are reporting on it just in a blurb in a sub article.
[3:08:57.960 --> 3:09:01.960]  That's what's crazy about this is, you'll have the New York Times over the weekend come
[3:09:01.960 --> 3:09:07.640]  out and say a pro-Trump conspiracy theorist, a false tweet and a runaway story and say
[3:09:07.640 --> 3:09:13.920]  that Comey never said in the May 3rd hearing or the June 8th hearing of last week that
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:18.600]  Trump never told him to stop an investigation.
[3:09:18.600 --> 3:09:22.960]  He said in both hearings that no one, including Trump, ever told him that.
[3:09:22.960 --> 3:09:28.480]  Well, how bold is the New York Times to get called fake news under oath and then in that
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:32.760]  same hearing claim that basically it never even happened.
[3:09:32.760 --> 3:09:33.760]  That's right.
[3:09:33.760 --> 3:09:34.760]  Comey admitted that they were wrong.
[3:09:34.760 --> 3:09:37.280]  Now, let's expand.
[3:09:37.280 --> 3:09:43.040]  They then come out in this article and in a Daily Beast article and say that I'm lying,
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:46.760]  these clips don't exist and that I'm an even bigger villain, that they called the New York
[3:09:46.760 --> 3:09:51.600]  stocking change and that it reversed in negative trading because of our video going viral.
[3:09:51.600 --> 3:09:55.320]  What you did is one of the top trends on Twitter, I'm one of the top trends today, I'm the top
[3:09:55.320 --> 3:09:56.320]  10 again today.
[3:09:56.320 --> 3:10:02.840]  I'm so evil, I'm so horrible, just the worst person ever, horrible person, because it's
[3:10:02.840 --> 3:10:03.840]  a big deal.
[3:10:03.840 --> 3:10:09.640]  There's a memo, supposedly, with them saying that Trump obstructed justice and ordered
[3:10:09.640 --> 3:10:10.640]  him to stop.
[3:10:10.640 --> 3:10:14.440]  Then we have a clip two months later that no one paid attention to where he says no one
[3:10:14.440 --> 3:10:15.440]  ever did it.
[3:10:15.440 --> 3:10:18.960]  People go, wow, it looks like Trump told the truth, stock market goes up.
[3:10:18.960 --> 3:10:19.960]  How horrible.
[3:10:19.960 --> 3:10:21.720]  We won't have a national crisis.
[3:10:21.720 --> 3:10:25.120]  Then last week, Senator Burr asked the question, we're going to play the clip again.
[3:10:25.120 --> 3:10:31.120]  And he says, he never ordered me to stop investigation and nobody else did.
[3:10:31.120 --> 3:10:33.680]  What does the New York Times do?
[3:10:33.680 --> 3:10:35.760]  They run the quotes and say we're fake.
[3:10:35.760 --> 3:10:41.320]  By name, Alex Jones, Jack Pesovic, Mike Cernovich, they say we're all liars and that we made
[3:10:41.320 --> 3:10:42.320]  up the quote.
[3:10:42.320 --> 3:10:44.240]  Now, get ready for this.
[3:10:44.240 --> 3:10:49.360]  The reason I prefaced this breaking news with that story I've been hammering since Sunday
[3:10:49.360 --> 3:10:56.720]  is Owen Schreuer found the clip, again, even AP admits that he said no orders to stop the
[3:10:56.720 --> 3:11:01.080]  investigation and that Trump was never, was told that he was not under investigation.
[3:11:01.080 --> 3:11:05.400]  All that's confirmed, AP, London Independent, they're all reporting it.
[3:11:05.400 --> 3:11:09.200]  The New York Times and Washington Post, they're saying it's not true, even though we have
[3:11:09.200 --> 3:11:10.200]  the video.
[3:11:10.200 --> 3:11:15.320]  Then Time Magazine has a blurb, but this hasn't really broken because it's not viral.
[3:11:15.320 --> 3:11:20.240]  We found it about two hours ago, we're about to break it down, Owen Schreuer, drumroll,
[3:11:20.240 --> 3:11:26.600]  we have another giant lie, Comey has been caught in, again, on the May 3rd hearing,
[3:11:26.600 --> 3:11:28.760]  the same one where he said nobody tried to influence him.
[3:11:28.760 --> 3:11:31.980]  He said, I've never leaked to the press.
[3:11:31.980 --> 3:11:37.400]  Now we know that before that May 3rd hearing and other times, he'd already leaked to the
[3:11:37.400 --> 3:11:38.400]  press.
[3:11:38.400 --> 3:11:39.880]  Owen Schreuer, break it down.
[3:11:39.880 --> 3:11:44.280]  So on May 3rd, there was a hearing that involved James Comey.
[3:11:44.280 --> 3:11:50.200]  He was asked a question by Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa, have you ever leaked anything to
[3:11:50.200 --> 3:11:51.200]  the media?
[3:11:51.200 --> 3:11:53.680]  We'll play that clip in a second, to which Comey said no.
[3:11:53.680 --> 3:11:55.240]  But here's the key.
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:12:00.800]  So because Comey may have actually perjured himself twice over this, once in the hearing
[3:12:00.800 --> 3:12:05.400]  where he answers the question against Grassley, and then again in the most recent hearing
[3:12:05.400 --> 3:12:11.640]  that got all the attention, he said in the most recent hearing that he responded to Trump's
[3:12:11.640 --> 3:12:19.640]  tape tweet, hope there's no tapes of our conversation, by leaking his memo to the media.
[3:12:19.640 --> 3:12:20.640]  That's what they say that-
[3:12:20.640 --> 3:12:24.760]  He woke up in the middle of the night and said, whoa, I got memos.
[3:12:24.760 --> 3:12:31.240]  Okay, so, but hold on, how is that possible if the story in the New York Times came out
[3:12:31.240 --> 3:12:36.360]  on May 11th in a private dinner Trump demanded loyalty, Comey demerred?
[3:12:36.360 --> 3:12:38.560]  This is the story he's referring to.
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:40.160]  This is the leak.
[3:12:40.160 --> 3:12:42.280]  That came out on May 11th.
[3:12:42.280 --> 3:12:46.160]  He says that he did that leak on after May 12th.
[3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:50.520]  And let's be clear, he said last Thursday on the 8th, he was the main leaker, and now
[3:12:50.520 --> 3:12:53.680]  Trump had already said that, so we know Trump has intel.
[3:12:53.680 --> 3:12:59.560]  So let's go to the clip of Chuck Grassley, what appears to be getting James Comey to
[3:12:59.560 --> 3:13:02.760]  lie under oath.
[3:13:02.760 --> 3:13:10.120]  Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating
[3:13:10.120 --> 3:13:14.280]  to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?
[3:13:14.280 --> 3:13:15.280]  Never.
[3:13:15.280 --> 3:13:16.280]  Wow.
[3:13:16.280 --> 3:13:17.280]  Never.
[3:13:17.280 --> 3:13:23.320]  And we now know under oath, he's now said he was and previous, but they won't find the
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:24.320]  memo.
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:25.800]  So here's why he's trapped.
[3:13:25.800 --> 3:13:28.360]  This is why he's trapped because he cannot win.
[3:13:28.360 --> 3:13:34.560]  Because even if he says, well, on May 3rd, I had not leaked anything yet, so technically
[3:13:34.560 --> 3:13:35.560]  I didn't lie there.
[3:13:35.560 --> 3:13:42.400]  Okay, well then you have a window between May 4th then and May 13th of which you would
[3:13:42.400 --> 3:13:44.680]  have had to have leaked that memo.
[3:13:44.680 --> 3:13:50.280]  Now according to your testimony just last week, that means that you would have had to
[3:13:50.280 --> 3:13:58.480]  release that leak to the quote unquote friend in media either on May 12th or on May 13th,
[3:13:58.480 --> 3:14:04.960]  which then that would make impossible this story that came out on May 11th.
[3:14:04.960 --> 3:14:06.800]  So Comey has perjured himself.
[3:14:06.800 --> 3:14:08.560]  He cannot get out of this.
[3:14:08.560 --> 3:14:10.280]  There is no way for him to get out of this.
[3:14:10.280 --> 3:14:15.320]  I would love to see the snake James Comey wiggle his way out of this one.
[3:14:15.320 --> 3:14:18.800]  And as you said, Alex, real media is reporting this.
[3:14:18.800 --> 3:14:23.140]  It's amazing the gaslighting the New York Times is doing here, Alex.
[3:14:23.140 --> 3:14:27.240]  This report says Attorney General Jeff Sessions to testify in public Tuesday.
[3:14:27.240 --> 3:14:28.240]  You see this report?
[3:14:28.240 --> 3:14:29.240]  Yes.
[3:14:29.240 --> 3:14:30.240]  He's not testifying Tuesday.
[3:14:30.240 --> 3:14:31.240]  It's not happening.
[3:14:31.240 --> 3:14:32.240]  It's a lie.
[3:14:32.240 --> 3:14:33.240]  He's not testifying.
[3:14:33.240 --> 3:14:36.320]  In fact, Jeff Sessions isn't even the Attorney General, Alex.
[3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:38.480]  Well, they say Trump isn't the president.
[3:14:38.480 --> 3:14:40.720]  He stole the election when it was Hillary trying to do it.
[3:14:40.720 --> 3:14:42.520]  Have you ever seen more gaslighting than that?
[3:14:42.520 --> 3:14:43.840]  And they want to talk about obstruction.
[3:14:43.840 --> 3:14:47.240]  Loretta Lynch told him to call the investigation a matter.
[3:14:47.240 --> 3:14:49.680]  And that came out in that same hearing that just happened last week.
[3:14:49.680 --> 3:14:52.640]  And now Dianne Feinstein is falling out of Loretta Lynch.
[3:14:52.640 --> 3:14:54.760]  Even Feinstein is saying, hey, we got to investigate this.
[3:14:54.760 --> 3:14:58.360]  I actually have a shred of dignity left and I'll actually say, well, here's the deal.
[3:14:58.360 --> 3:15:00.160]  They know nobody's buying it if they don't.
[3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:01.160]  Right.
[3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:02.160]  So they want to get two investigations going.
[3:15:02.160 --> 3:15:03.160]  In fact, can we queue up?
[3:15:03.160 --> 3:15:04.160]  Dianne Feinstein, go ahead, dude.
[3:15:04.160 --> 3:15:05.160]  Yeah.
[3:15:05.160 --> 3:15:07.040]  Well, it just shows you that that's where the obstruction was going on.
[3:15:07.040 --> 3:15:08.360]  It wasn't going on with Trump.
[3:15:08.360 --> 3:15:11.560]  Trump was saying, if he even said, I hope, because now we don't even know.
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:12.800]  Trump said he didn't say that.
[3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:14.440]  I hope you could let this go.
[3:15:14.440 --> 3:15:16.200]  And he said it wasn't an order.
[3:15:16.200 --> 3:15:17.200]  He was asked by everybody.
[3:15:17.200 --> 3:15:18.200]  Was that a direct order?
[3:15:18.200 --> 3:15:19.200]  No, no, no, no.
[3:15:19.200 --> 3:15:20.200]  It wasn't a direct order.
[3:15:20.200 --> 3:15:22.160]  Well, here's the deal.
[3:15:22.160 --> 3:15:25.080]  We know he leaked a memo because it's his memo.
[3:15:25.080 --> 3:15:26.920]  He didn't give it to the Justice Department.
[3:15:26.920 --> 3:15:28.480]  That's illegal.
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:31.040]  Then we could tell they floated it so they could exaggerate.
[3:15:31.040 --> 3:15:32.040]  Wasn't there.
[3:15:32.040 --> 3:15:33.360]  He knew they were lying about it.
[3:15:33.360 --> 3:15:36.960]  He let them lie about what was in the memo that nobody can see.
[3:15:36.960 --> 3:15:40.280]  Then he goes and testifies two months later after the 18th of February on May 3rd that
[3:15:40.280 --> 3:15:42.680]  no one ever tried to influence him.
[3:15:42.680 --> 3:15:45.440]  And then he's forced to come back at this hearing and say, that's the truth.
[3:15:45.440 --> 3:15:48.440]  So he's, again, lying in the memo, lying on the other end.
[3:15:48.440 --> 3:15:51.240]  He's lying because he let the media go forward.
[3:15:51.240 --> 3:15:54.280]  He's so discredited.
[3:15:54.280 --> 3:15:56.800]  And Trump, she has a blind spot.
[3:15:56.800 --> 3:15:58.640]  He hasn't done any of this stuff.
[3:15:58.640 --> 3:16:01.160]  So he says, you know, forget you, screw you.
[3:16:01.160 --> 3:16:02.160]  I don't care.
[3:16:02.160 --> 3:16:03.160]  I'll testify to Congress.
[3:16:03.160 --> 3:16:04.160]  He doesn't get.
[3:16:04.160 --> 3:16:05.160]  They don't care.
[3:16:05.160 --> 3:16:08.680]  They're going to keep lying and keep lying and say, kill him.
[3:16:08.680 --> 3:16:10.720]  I mean, I agree with Dr. Corsi and others.
[3:16:10.720 --> 3:16:12.480]  And of course, he obviously worked at PsiOps.
[3:16:12.480 --> 3:16:13.680]  He didn't just work at the State Department.
[3:16:13.680 --> 3:16:14.680]  I'll leave it at that.
[3:16:14.680 --> 3:16:18.600]  When he says the CIA is getting ready to kill the president, I mean, they're getting ready.
[3:16:18.600 --> 3:16:22.680]  I mean, they are pushing, just so everybody keeps hearing about his death that when, oh,
[3:16:22.680 --> 3:16:27.520]  you hear he got killed or whatever, you just, they don't want people to riot when they hear
[3:16:27.520 --> 3:16:28.520]  it.
[3:16:28.520 --> 3:16:29.520]  Okay.
[3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:32.040]  And this country is in deep crap.
[3:16:32.040 --> 3:16:34.560]  And I mean, folks ask, why am I so behind Trump?
[3:16:34.560 --> 3:16:35.560]  It's so obvious.
[3:16:35.560 --> 3:16:38.720]  Every enemy, every scumbag, every globalist is against him.
[3:16:38.720 --> 3:16:44.280]  And I am just so ashamed of the left and people that are a bunch of bullies running because
[3:16:44.280 --> 3:16:49.000]  you didn't get the crime boss, Hillary, and the stock market's up and you're mad because
[3:16:49.000 --> 3:16:55.760]  he doesn't want to bring in unvetted people from failed countries that murder liberals.
[3:16:55.760 --> 3:16:59.080]  I mean, the real super right-wing nutballs are the Muslims.
[3:16:59.080 --> 3:17:01.720]  I mean, why the hell would the left one of them in here?
[3:17:01.720 --> 3:17:03.000]  That's actually an interesting point.
[3:17:03.000 --> 3:17:08.800]  If you, the image that they try to paint Trump supporters as, that's actually what Islam
[3:17:08.800 --> 3:17:09.800]  is.
[3:17:09.800 --> 3:17:10.800]  They are the ones that oppress women.
[3:17:10.800 --> 3:17:17.600]  They are the ones, if anybody that has an oppressive society that's unilaterally oppressive
[3:17:17.600 --> 3:17:20.000]  of women, that's not Trump supporters.
[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:21.000]  They don't care.
[3:17:21.000 --> 3:17:22.000]  They think they're in a club.
[3:17:22.000 --> 3:17:24.080]  They think they're in a winning group when they were with Hillary.
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:25.440]  Then when that didn't happen, they got upset.
[3:17:25.440 --> 3:17:27.440]  We're not winners now because they're delusional.
[3:17:27.440 --> 3:17:28.440]  They're like in a cult.
[3:17:28.440 --> 3:17:29.600]  They're not getting anything.
[3:17:29.600 --> 3:17:31.240]  They're getting screwed over.
[3:17:31.240 --> 3:17:32.240]  Trump's only delivering.
[3:17:32.240 --> 3:17:35.360]  I've talked to so many liberals that go, yeah, my 401K is way up.
[3:17:35.360 --> 3:17:36.360]  Yeah, it's up 20%.
[3:17:36.360 --> 3:17:37.760]  I've never made profits like this.
[3:17:37.760 --> 3:17:38.760]  Yeah, there is more hiring.
[3:17:38.760 --> 3:17:39.760]  Yeah, my restaurant.
[3:17:39.760 --> 3:17:40.760]  They just open lines.
[3:17:40.760 --> 3:17:44.520]  I had a parking lot the other day, like four gay guys come over.
[3:17:44.520 --> 3:17:48.640]  They were like middle-aged guys, professionals, getting in BMWs, good-looking guys.
[3:17:48.640 --> 3:17:52.160]  And they literally went, Alex, you know, we're really ashamed of you.
[3:17:52.160 --> 3:17:53.880]  We're libertarians used to like you.
[3:17:53.880 --> 3:17:56.760]  Trump's a monster in trying to do this and that to us.
[3:17:56.760 --> 3:17:57.760]  And you know, I said, oh, really?
[3:17:57.760 --> 3:17:58.760]  How's your 401K?
[3:17:58.760 --> 3:18:00.600]  They go, well, as you can see, we're wealthy.
[3:18:00.600 --> 3:18:02.480]  We're making more money, but still it doesn't matter.
[3:18:02.480 --> 3:18:05.000]  You know, you're being really, and I go, what has Trump actually done to you?
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:06.680]  And they couldn't say they didn't care.
[3:18:06.680 --> 3:18:11.120]  They were just getting into being mad at me that Trump was being mean to them when Trump
[3:18:11.120 --> 3:18:16.440]  hasn't done anything to them, except get Republicans to not hate gay people and have a rainbow flag
[3:18:16.440 --> 3:18:17.440]  at the convention.
[3:18:17.440 --> 3:18:20.200]  Except up on the first coal mine in ten years.
[3:18:20.200 --> 3:18:21.200]  Exactly.
[3:18:21.200 --> 3:18:24.000]  All he's doing is turning the country back on.
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:28.680]  And Hollywood, the truth is, hates America, hates Christians, hates straight people.
[3:18:28.680 --> 3:18:32.360]  I'm not saying all gay people hate us, but the point is they're the ones that are the
[3:18:32.360 --> 3:18:33.360]  mafia.
[3:18:33.360 --> 3:18:34.360]  They're getting off on culture control.
[3:18:34.360 --> 3:18:36.800]  And I'm not saying that even the gay people are doing this.
[3:18:36.800 --> 3:18:39.600]  I'm just saying Hollywood hates America.
[3:18:39.600 --> 3:18:43.440]  And we're not the one that, so, Hollywood hates America, Islam hates America, so they
[3:18:43.440 --> 3:18:44.440]  love each other.
[3:18:44.440 --> 3:18:49.800]  The great Satan Hollywood loves the great Satan Islam, and the great leader of Satanism,
[3:18:49.800 --> 3:18:51.960]  and they just want to destroy us.
[3:18:51.960 --> 3:18:58.400]  Well, America, for all of its flaws, has created the most vast wealth for the most people.
[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:03.280]  And the freest open society in the byproduct of a bunch of bitching and complaining spoil
[3:19:03.280 --> 3:19:07.360]  brats that sit here with all this freedom and piss all over it.
[3:19:07.360 --> 3:19:08.360]  And that's what they hate.
[3:19:08.360 --> 3:19:09.360]  At least skip the break.
[3:19:09.360 --> 3:19:12.960]  They literally hate the fact that they live in the greatest country on earth.
[3:19:12.960 --> 3:19:15.960]  I mean, it just says, we have time.
[3:19:15.960 --> 3:19:20.600]  We have this new system where we're running the show ourselves, so I don't know how then
[3:19:20.600 --> 3:19:22.000]  we don't have time to do it.
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:25.560]  Because when Harmon was going on vacation, I guess, and then the other guy's like, yeah,
[3:19:25.560 --> 3:19:27.280]  you'll be running your own show, you can skip breaks easier.
[3:19:27.280 --> 3:19:28.280]  So now I'm going to find out.
[3:19:28.280 --> 3:19:31.680]  I'm going to find out why, because we've got to break why I can't do this now.
[3:19:31.680 --> 3:19:34.120]  Because this is not what I was told.
[3:19:34.120 --> 3:19:36.200]  And now the opposite has happened.
[3:19:36.200 --> 3:19:39.440]  And I'm going to find out, listen, bottom line, folks, get the video from earlier where
[3:19:39.440 --> 3:19:40.440]  we were live.
[3:19:40.440 --> 3:19:42.880]  We're going to post it on YouTube and Facebook the next 30 minutes.
[3:19:42.880 --> 3:19:43.880]  Make it go viral.
[3:19:43.880 --> 3:19:47.680]  Comey caught in giant perjury saying he's not the leaker.
[3:19:47.680 --> 3:19:52.360]  Bombshell, bombshell, bombshell, bombshell, bombshell.
[3:19:52.360 --> 3:19:54.000]  Get ready in full warriors.
[3:19:54.000 --> 3:19:55.000]  Get ready.
[3:19:55.000 --> 3:19:56.880]  We're going to ram this down their dirty throats.
[3:19:56.880 --> 3:19:57.880]  Straight ahead.
[3:19:57.880 --> 3:20:03.840]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[3:20:03.840 --> 3:20:05.420]  Those times may be near.
[3:20:05.420 --> 3:20:06.420]  Think about it.
[3:20:06.420 --> 3:20:11.120]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[3:20:11.120 --> 3:20:15.880]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[3:20:15.880 --> 3:20:19.680]  And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages
[3:20:19.680 --> 3:20:21.720]  from a single cyber attack.
[3:20:21.720 --> 3:20:25.880]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide
[3:20:25.880 --> 3:20:28.480]  during a widespread national emergency.
[3:20:28.480 --> 3:20:31.480]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[3:20:31.480 --> 3:20:34.200]  That's where my Patriot supply comes in.

[3:20:58.680 --> 3:20:59.680]  Emdix Essentials.
[3:20:59.680 --> 3:21:00.680]  That's my middle name.
[3:21:00.680 --> 3:21:06.800]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[3:21:06.800 --> 3:21:12.120]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[3:21:12.120 --> 3:21:13.120]  and high quality.
[3:21:13.120 --> 3:21:19.320]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high-quality
[3:21:19.320 --> 3:21:22.280]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[3:21:22.280 --> 3:21:26.760]  If there are such Patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[3:21:26.760 --> 3:21:27.760]  It is an answer to prayer.
[3:21:27.760 --> 3:21:31.720]  And because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign-up for auto-ship, an
[3:21:31.720 --> 3:21:33.920]  additional 25% off.
[3:21:33.920 --> 3:21:35.000]  It's all there.
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:40.400]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[3:21:40.400 --> 3:21:44.960]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emdix Essentials, and it's
[3:21:44.960 --> 3:21:51.240]  on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from infowarstore.com.

[3:22:03.240 --> 3:22:07.400]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[3:22:07.400 --> 3:22:12.280]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat

[3:24:16.720 --> 3:24:25.800]  So, the former director of the FBI, James Comey, a self-admitted leaker.
[3:24:25.800 --> 3:24:28.680]  He admitted it under testimony that he leaked.
[3:24:28.680 --> 3:24:32.080]  He also admitted it under testimony that he never leaked.
[3:24:32.080 --> 3:24:37.600]  I'd like to see him get called to task for those two testimonies under oath.
[3:24:37.600 --> 3:24:41.720]  I'd like to give a testimony right now to infowarsstore.com products.
[3:24:41.720 --> 3:24:47.760]  I can tell you I have tried just about every product at infowarsstore.com and they are all
[3:24:47.760 --> 3:24:48.760]  incredible.
[3:24:48.760 --> 3:24:50.560]  I have felt the effects of all of them.
[3:24:50.560 --> 3:24:55.240]  Some of them, quite honestly, the effects are too strong and I had to actually cut it
[3:24:55.240 --> 3:25:00.160]  out of my routine because the effects were so strong that I just couldn't take it.
[3:25:00.160 --> 3:25:02.200]  But the super blue toothpaste, incredible.
[3:25:02.200 --> 3:25:07.400]  We got the special going right now, X2 BioTrue Selenium Combo.
[3:25:07.400 --> 3:25:10.400]  That's got a 4.9 star review, that combo.
[3:25:10.400 --> 3:25:11.400]  That's unbelievable.
[3:25:11.400 --> 3:25:15.240]  The Selenium is actually one of the products that I started taking that was too strong
[3:25:15.240 --> 3:25:16.240]  for me.
[3:25:16.240 --> 3:25:19.680]  I don't need it, but the impact was serious.
[3:25:19.680 --> 3:25:24.000]  The X2 is a life-changing product that I suggest everybody out there tries.
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:28.040]  Once you try the X2, that's going to be something you're going to want to have in your cabinet
[3:25:28.040 --> 3:25:29.040]  at all times.
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:33.680]  And, of course, the super blue fluoride-free toothpaste, a HESC seller.
[3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:34.680]  That auto-ship tab.
[3:25:34.680 --> 3:25:35.680]  It'll keep coming.
[3:25:35.680 --> 3:25:39.520]  You can pick the time period when you want it to come and you get 10% off.
[3:25:39.520 --> 3:25:45.560]  And now we've got the products that are just everyday products like the shampoo, the body
[3:25:45.560 --> 3:25:47.720]  deodorant, everything, the body wash.
[3:25:47.720 --> 3:25:50.200]  I used the sunscreen when I went out there on Saturday.
[3:25:50.200 --> 3:25:51.800]  I used the sunscreen as well.
[3:25:51.800 --> 3:25:53.240]  You'll be seeing that commercial.
[3:25:53.240 --> 3:25:55.480]  I used the deodorant too.
[3:25:55.480 --> 3:25:57.040]  That commercial is going to be out too.
[3:25:57.040 --> 3:26:01.360]  So I know that everybody is anxiously awaiting the great EmRick's Essentials commercials
[3:26:01.360 --> 3:26:02.360]  that we're coming out with.
[3:26:02.360 --> 3:26:03.840]  Oh, you got a lot coming out.
[3:26:03.840 --> 3:26:06.000]  But even the shampoo is incredible.
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:11.040]  I was amazed at how much the shampoo just makes your hair actually feel full.
[3:26:11.040 --> 3:26:12.840]  That commercial that we have is no joke, folks.
[3:26:12.840 --> 3:26:15.120]  It really does give your hair body.
[3:26:15.120 --> 3:26:16.120]  And then the bug spray.
[3:26:16.120 --> 3:26:17.120]  EmRick's Essentials bug spray.
[3:26:17.120 --> 3:26:18.560]  I think that that is a must-have too.
[3:26:18.560 --> 3:26:20.360]  So you keep the bugs off you.
[3:26:20.360 --> 3:26:22.240]  You don't spray yourself with poison.
[3:26:22.240 --> 3:26:23.680]  So get those products.

[3:26:41.440 --> 3:26:44.600]  Let's go to some of the callers here who's been holding the longest.
[3:26:44.600 --> 3:26:52.920]  It looks like O'Brien's, or no, yeah, we'll go to O'Brien first straight out of 1984 O'Brien
[3:26:52.920 --> 3:26:53.920]  in Maryland.
[3:26:53.920 --> 3:26:54.920]  Go ahead.
[3:26:54.920 --> 3:26:55.920]  Yeah.
[3:26:55.920 --> 3:26:56.920]  I found this article.
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:04.000]  I just popped up my old mom's phone that said, basically, Maryland and D.C. Sue's Trump Over
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:05.000]  Foreign Payments.
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:09.800]  I mean, I want to know what your take is on that.
[3:27:09.800 --> 3:27:10.800]  You repeat the headline again?
[3:27:10.800 --> 3:27:11.800]  Yeah.
[3:27:11.800 --> 3:27:12.800]  I'm having trouble hearing you.
[3:27:12.800 --> 3:27:13.800]  Go ahead.
[3:27:13.800 --> 3:27:19.800]  It's called Maryland and D.C. Sue's Trump Over Foreign Payments.
[3:27:19.800 --> 3:27:20.800]  Ah, okay.
[3:27:20.800 --> 3:27:21.800]  We've got this.
[3:27:21.800 --> 3:27:23.000]  We've got the story up now.
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:24.640]  And that's a New York Times article, guys.
[3:27:24.640 --> 3:27:25.640]  Pull that back up.
[3:27:25.640 --> 3:27:27.200]  No, it's CNN.
[3:27:27.200 --> 3:27:29.880]  Oh, they pulled a New York Times version.
[3:27:29.880 --> 3:27:34.560]  You know, there was something going around that Trump was getting paid off by the Saudis
[3:27:34.560 --> 3:27:40.600]  because an individual consultation firm, a firm that was being paid by the Saudis, set
[3:27:40.600 --> 3:27:44.760]  up some parties somewhere in some Trump hotels, and they're like, this is proof of payment.
[3:27:44.760 --> 3:27:45.760]  This is proof.
[3:27:45.760 --> 3:27:50.000]  This is a consulting firm going in and saying, hey, we want to throw some parties here.
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:52.360]  And it was like a couple hundred thousand dollars.
[3:27:52.360 --> 3:27:57.480]  It wasn't even the millions of dollars that you see Hillary Clinton getting from all the
[3:27:57.480 --> 3:28:02.480]  payments through to her, the Saudis gave her millions of dollars just to get elected.
[3:28:02.480 --> 3:28:06.480]  Well, and it's crazy too, Rob, not just the double standard that they have for foreign
[3:28:06.480 --> 3:28:09.760]  money coming into Trump versus other candidates.
[3:28:09.760 --> 3:28:13.440]  You know, they've got all of the evidence as well.
[3:28:13.440 --> 3:28:16.840]  The same stuff that they're trying to put on Trump, they actually have on Podesta.
[3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:17.840]  You actually have that.
[3:28:17.840 --> 3:28:18.840]  The payments.
[3:28:18.840 --> 3:28:24.200]  You have that evidence, hardcore, raw with Hillary and Podesta and them, and then they
[3:28:24.200 --> 3:28:27.840]  want to sit here and try to act like Trump is the one.
[3:28:27.840 --> 3:28:29.880]  So they're going to try to push these stories, I'm sure.
[3:28:29.880 --> 3:28:36.080]  But the funny thing to me is, you, meanwhile, you had the Saudi Arabian arms deal that President
[3:28:36.080 --> 3:28:41.760]  Trump made, and you actually have a group of GOP representatives right now that are
[3:28:41.760 --> 3:28:44.160]  trying to blockade that arms deal.
[3:28:44.160 --> 3:28:46.960]  But somehow, for some reason, the left is silent.
[3:28:46.960 --> 3:28:48.960]  They must be stockholders in Raytheon.
[3:28:48.960 --> 3:28:51.360]  They must be stockholders in Lockheed Martin.
[3:28:51.360 --> 3:28:55.760]  You'd think that they would be calling out that arms deal all day long, yet nothing from
[3:28:55.760 --> 3:28:58.160]  Democrats, nothing from the left.
[3:28:58.160 --> 3:28:59.560]  It comes from the right.
[3:28:59.560 --> 3:29:01.120]  It comes from conservatives.
[3:29:01.120 --> 3:29:02.800]  It comes from the GOP.
[3:29:02.800 --> 3:29:09.000]  It just goes to show you that the crosshairs that the left is using right now to try to
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:13.560]  snipe things that they don't view as right or doesn't go along with their virtues, they're
[3:29:13.560 --> 3:29:14.640]  not even aiming right.
[3:29:14.640 --> 3:29:16.320]  They don't even know where they're pointing.
[3:29:16.320 --> 3:29:18.320]  They have no idea what's going on.
[3:29:18.320 --> 3:29:19.320]  Anything else, O'Brien?
[3:29:19.320 --> 3:29:26.320]  Well, yeah, there was a, you guys may have heard about, about the military actions.
[3:29:26.320 --> 3:29:33.320]  I mean, there's military news and about all these figures being stolen or whatever.
[3:29:33.320 --> 3:29:40.160]  Basically, I had a theory, and it goes something like this, what is all, it's not just a man
[3:29:40.160 --> 3:29:44.600]  that would steal all the photos there, but what is this, what if there were women who
[3:29:44.600 --> 3:29:46.600]  were also stealing the photos there?
[3:29:46.600 --> 3:29:47.600]  Okay, I'm not sure what he's saying.
[3:29:47.600 --> 3:29:48.600]  He's saying something about stealing photos.

[3:33:10.840 --> 3:33:19.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:19.680 --> 3:33:24.440]  Want to clarify something just to clear the air of any confusion.
[3:33:24.440 --> 3:33:28.360]  We're trying to cooperate these dates with Comey's testimony, and the crew is just making
[3:33:28.360 --> 3:33:30.960]  sure that we report everything right here.
[3:33:30.960 --> 3:33:32.200]  So here's the deal.
[3:33:32.200 --> 3:33:39.920]  May 3rd, James Comey testifies under oath that he has never leaked anything to the press
[3:33:39.920 --> 3:33:44.120]  at all as far as the Trump-Russia investigation is going.
[3:33:44.120 --> 3:33:47.800]  May 9th, James Comey gets fired.
[3:33:47.800 --> 3:33:55.160]  May 11th, New York Times prints the story that Trump demanded for Comey's honest loyalty.
[3:33:55.160 --> 3:34:01.160]  Then in the most recent, and then, excuse me, May 12th, Trump says, boy, I hope there's
[3:34:01.160 --> 3:34:03.880]  no tapes of our conversation.
[3:34:03.880 --> 3:34:08.040]  And then most recently, I think it was what June 7th was the hearing, the most recent
[3:34:08.040 --> 3:34:09.040]  hearing.
[3:34:09.040 --> 3:34:11.640]  And then Comey says that he did leak.
[3:34:11.640 --> 3:34:18.960]  So that means, based on the timing of events, you would assume that May 3rd, Comey perhaps
[3:34:18.960 --> 3:34:22.440]  was telling the truth, saying he'd never leaked anything.
[3:34:22.440 --> 3:34:28.960]  Then he gets fired on May 9th, leaks May 10th, story gets printed May 11th, Trump's
[3:34:28.960 --> 3:34:31.360]  tapes tweet happens May 12th.
[3:34:31.360 --> 3:34:38.680]  Then Comey says that he did the leak in response to Trump's tapes tweet, but based on that
[3:34:38.680 --> 3:34:41.520]  timeline of events, that wouldn't be true.
[3:34:41.520 --> 3:34:43.520]  That's the investigation that needs to take place.
[3:34:43.520 --> 3:34:47.480]  Donald Trump, President Trump felt like the FBI, James Comey were the leakers the whole
[3:34:47.480 --> 3:34:48.480]  time.
[3:34:48.480 --> 3:34:49.980]  So there's the investigation, Rob do.
[3:34:49.980 --> 3:34:52.000]  And Comey was in cahoots with Obama.
[3:34:52.000 --> 3:34:57.000]  He actually stood down when Lynch said, hey, call it a matter, not an investigation.
[3:34:57.000 --> 3:35:01.320]  And you hear that whole story in that hearing where he's like, well, she told me to call
[3:35:01.320 --> 3:35:03.800]  it a matter and she clarified it twice.
[3:35:03.800 --> 3:35:05.160]  And that was a direct order.
[3:35:05.160 --> 3:35:09.040]  But yet when somebody says, I hope we can fix this up and finish it up and hey, by the
[3:35:09.040 --> 3:35:12.720]  way, could you go out and tell the media I'm not under investigation, you've told me that
[3:35:12.720 --> 3:35:16.760]  three times, everybody else in the world knows that yet that doesn't get leaked out, as Marco
[3:35:16.760 --> 3:35:17.760]  Rubio pointed out.
[3:35:17.760 --> 3:35:22.880]  Here's an article I just found, a Maryland DC attorneys to sue Trump over hotel interest.
[3:35:22.880 --> 3:35:29.000]  So basically because here's a businessman who has businesses before he's president.
[3:35:29.000 --> 3:35:31.080]  He doesn't know he's going to be president till the election.
[3:35:31.080 --> 3:35:35.320]  That's when everybody cast their votes and they go, hey, you won.
[3:35:35.320 --> 3:35:40.280]  So then is he supposed to sell every interest in everything he's ever had and done and destroy
[3:35:40.280 --> 3:35:44.120]  his business empire right there at that point?
[3:35:44.120 --> 3:35:48.120]  When you have Hillary Clinton making deals and getting money to her Clinton Foundation
[3:35:48.120 --> 3:35:53.600]  to do favors for other countries, have we looked at the Bahrain jewels that she got?
[3:35:53.600 --> 3:35:55.600]  I mean, insanity.
[3:35:55.600 --> 3:35:59.440]  And here's another thing, this was in Comey's little memo that he wrote up, his little write-up
[3:35:59.440 --> 3:36:03.480]  where he went and met with President Trump on January 6th.
[3:36:03.480 --> 3:36:07.000]  He is the one who said, let's have a private meeting.
[3:36:07.000 --> 3:36:08.000]  Let's talk about Pgate.
[3:36:08.000 --> 3:36:09.000]  This is about to come out.
[3:36:09.000 --> 3:36:12.880]  I want to tell you about it, just so you know, it's between us, me and you.
[3:36:12.880 --> 3:36:16.040]  So he's the one who initiates private meetings, okay?
[3:36:16.040 --> 3:36:20.040]  Comey, you're going to a club and you've never been there before and somebody comes up and
[3:36:20.040 --> 3:36:21.560]  says, here's a secret handshake.
[3:36:21.560 --> 3:36:23.480]  All right, so now I know the secret handshake.
[3:36:23.480 --> 3:36:26.280]  I'm going to do the secret handshake with other people.
[3:36:26.280 --> 3:36:29.160]  Comey is coming in saying, we have private meetings.
[3:36:29.160 --> 3:36:30.320]  This is normal.
[3:36:30.320 --> 3:36:31.320]  You're the president-elect.
[3:36:31.320 --> 3:36:32.960]  I'm going to have a private meeting with you.
[3:36:32.960 --> 3:36:38.160]  So then when Trump has him with him later on, oh my God, how could he ask for a private
[3:36:38.160 --> 3:36:39.160]  meeting?
[3:36:39.160 --> 3:36:40.360]  Like, that's the insanity of it.
[3:36:40.360 --> 3:36:43.800]  There was a judge a couple days ago that came out and said, oh, Trump tried to talk to me
[3:36:43.800 --> 3:36:45.760]  on the phone too.
[3:36:45.760 --> 3:36:47.760]  Like this is a bad thing.
[3:36:47.760 --> 3:36:48.760]  Communication is bad.
[3:36:48.760 --> 3:36:53.560]  Well, this lawsuit isn't going to get any legs because I'm sure that the moves that
[3:36:53.560 --> 3:36:59.480]  Trump made to hand everything that was under the Trump empire over to his sons was included,
[3:36:59.480 --> 3:37:00.480]  including this hotel.
[3:37:00.480 --> 3:37:02.720]  So my guess is this lawsuit isn't going to have anything to it.
[3:37:02.720 --> 3:37:04.320]  They just want to put it out in the media.
[3:37:04.320 --> 3:37:05.320]  Oh, we're fine.
[3:37:05.320 --> 3:37:06.320]  We're fine.
[3:37:06.320 --> 3:37:07.320]  A lawsuit against Trump.
[3:37:07.320 --> 3:37:11.720]  But that's another point you make that's just sitting in plain view where Comey is pretending
[3:37:11.720 --> 3:37:13.440]  like it's some sort of outrageous deal.
[3:37:13.440 --> 3:37:15.520]  No one's ever had a secret meeting.
[3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:19.240]  That Trump and Comey would be one on one or that it was President Trump that requested
[3:37:19.240 --> 3:37:20.240]  it.
[3:37:20.240 --> 3:37:25.040]  It was James Comey that actually requested it, and it's the same thing with the fake
[3:37:25.040 --> 3:37:27.320]  news saying Comey was an aggressive memo taker.
[3:37:27.320 --> 3:37:33.680]  But let's recall, under oath, James Comey said he only met with Obama he thinks twice
[3:37:33.680 --> 3:37:36.040]  and that he never took memos.
[3:37:36.040 --> 3:37:37.040]  So either Comey-
[3:37:37.040 --> 3:37:42.120]  One was for over an hour talking about law enforcement, but I'm not going to take any
[3:37:42.120 --> 3:37:43.200]  notes on that one.
[3:37:43.200 --> 3:37:44.200]  So you're just completely-
[3:37:44.200 --> 3:37:45.800]  Maybe it has to do with gun running.
[3:37:45.800 --> 3:37:49.600]  Maybe it has to do with guns going over the border to Mexico, like Eric Holder was doing.
[3:37:49.600 --> 3:37:51.160]  But that's what it has to do with.
[3:37:51.160 --> 3:37:52.160]  We knew that this was coming.
[3:37:52.160 --> 3:37:57.640]  The night of the election, Alex Jones sat in this chair and could barely even celebrate
[3:37:57.640 --> 3:37:59.480]  because he knew that this war was coming.
[3:37:59.480 --> 3:38:02.280]  He knew that they would do everything to stop President Trump.
[3:38:02.280 --> 3:38:08.520]  And Ivanka goes on Fox and Friends this morning and she is shocked at the viciousness in Washington.
[3:38:08.520 --> 3:38:14.240]  Yes, Ivanka, they want to stop your father, President Trump, from making America great
[3:38:14.240 --> 3:38:15.240]  again.
[3:38:15.240 --> 3:38:16.240]  That's why they're so vicious.
[3:38:16.240 --> 3:38:18.360]  Here's Ivanka Trump.
[3:38:18.360 --> 3:38:19.760]  We move down to Washington.
[3:38:19.760 --> 3:38:20.840]  We want to be helpful.
[3:38:20.840 --> 3:38:24.360]  We want to do big things, important things.
[3:38:24.360 --> 3:38:27.360]  And there's nothing more important than enabling people to do.
[3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:28.760]  Is it harder than your thought, though?
[3:38:28.760 --> 3:38:32.800]  Is it harder than your thought to stick to the things you want to do because of what
[3:38:32.800 --> 3:38:37.560]  keeps coming up, whether it's the Russia investigation or something else?
[3:38:37.560 --> 3:38:38.920]  It is hard.
[3:38:38.920 --> 3:38:45.400]  And there's a level of viciousness that I was not expecting.
[3:38:45.400 --> 3:38:49.360]  I was not expecting the intensity of this experience.
[3:38:49.360 --> 3:38:51.560]  But this isn't supposed to be easy.
[3:38:51.560 --> 3:38:56.720]  My father and this administration intends to be transformative.
[3:38:56.720 --> 3:38:59.680]  And we want to do big, bold things.
[3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:02.280]  And we're looking to change the status quo.
[3:39:02.280 --> 3:39:04.520]  So I didn't expect it to be easy.
[3:39:04.520 --> 3:39:14.400]  I think some of the distractions and some of the ferocity was I was a little blindsided
[3:39:14.400 --> 3:39:16.040]  by on a personal level.
[3:39:16.040 --> 3:39:21.520]  But for me, I am trying to keep my head down, not listen to the noise and just work really
[3:39:21.520 --> 3:39:26.560]  hard to make a positive impact in the lives of many people.
[3:39:26.560 --> 3:39:31.280]  If you want to, at the end of the day, if you want to think about difficult, it's the factory
[3:39:31.280 --> 3:39:33.680]  worker who's been laid off.
[3:39:33.680 --> 3:39:37.680]  Difficult is the mother who's lost a child to opioid abuse.
[3:39:37.680 --> 3:39:39.120]  So these are the real challenges.
[3:39:39.120 --> 3:39:43.800]  And I think that does put it in perspective for me every time we get out into the country.
[3:39:43.800 --> 3:39:47.960]  And meet with American people who are very optimistic about what's happening.
[3:39:47.960 --> 3:39:50.560]  And they see the economy and it's just booming.
[3:39:50.560 --> 3:39:56.040]  Small businesses have this sense of just vigor.
[3:39:56.040 --> 3:39:59.400]  And I was talking with somebody the other day who was referring to it as the animal
[3:39:59.400 --> 3:40:00.400]  spirits.
[3:40:00.400 --> 3:40:03.000]  The small business owners have been released.
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  So there is a tremendous energy, but there's also real challenges.
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:09.520]  And that's what we're looking to address.
[3:40:09.520 --> 3:40:13.800]  I like the statement she makes there, changing the status quo.
[3:40:13.800 --> 3:40:17.680]  That is the biggest thing I think that has happened so far as President Trump and the
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:22.480]  American people that elected him have changed the status quo worldwide.
[3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:27.160]  And that's why citizens of the world are backing Trump, thanking us for electing Trump to change
[3:40:27.160 --> 3:40:28.160]  that status quo.
[3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:29.160]  Rob, any comments?
[3:40:29.160 --> 3:40:30.160]  We'll take calls.
[3:40:30.160 --> 3:40:32.640]  The president of Romania had glowing reviews after meeting with Trump.
[3:40:32.640 --> 3:40:36.720]  You know, he was like, hey, this guy's all on board with everything about fighting terror,
[3:40:36.720 --> 3:40:37.720]  everything.
[3:40:37.720 --> 3:40:38.720]  We totally agree with him.
[3:40:38.720 --> 3:40:40.200]  Yeah, just yeah.
[3:40:40.200 --> 3:40:41.200]  But a couple things.
[3:40:41.200 --> 3:40:42.640]  I like how she's talking about opioids.
[3:40:42.640 --> 3:40:43.720]  Nobody's talking about that.
[3:40:43.720 --> 3:40:46.400]  You don't hear big pharma media talking about opioids.
[3:40:46.400 --> 3:40:49.720]  I think we should do a whole week on just little things about the opioid epidemic because
[3:40:49.720 --> 3:40:50.720]  it's coming from two places.
[3:40:50.720 --> 3:40:51.720]  It's coming from big pharma.
[3:40:51.720 --> 3:40:55.320]  It's coming from Afghanistan poppy fields that our troops are currently guarding right
[3:40:55.320 --> 3:40:59.400]  now and delivering fertilizer to and helping these guys make their shipments.
[3:40:59.400 --> 3:41:00.960]  That's where your opioids are coming from.
[3:41:00.960 --> 3:41:03.120]  Don't hear a lot of people talking about that.
[3:41:03.120 --> 3:41:06.480]  Another thing, Ivanka, this is my little message to you.
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:09.320]  All the viciousness you're talking about, these people attacking you constantly.
[3:41:09.320 --> 3:41:12.840]  These are also the same people that telling you global warming is real and climate change
[3:41:12.840 --> 3:41:13.840]  is all manmade.
[3:41:13.840 --> 3:41:15.280]  And there's nothing else you could do about it.
[3:41:15.280 --> 3:41:19.840]  We have to give all our money to Al Gore to the blood gore of investment fund.
[3:41:19.840 --> 3:41:23.160]  So just remember that these are the same people that are telling you all these things that
[3:41:23.160 --> 3:41:27.080]  you kind of believe, which I do believe you think climate change is totally manmade.
[3:41:27.080 --> 3:41:30.960]  There's no other debate about it because all the science is real and the science is in.
[3:41:30.960 --> 3:41:34.480]  But yeah, these are also the same people that are attacking you, everything you say, calling
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:37.480]  you out on every little thing, every dress you wear.
[3:41:37.480 --> 3:41:39.920]  So just remember that going forward.
[3:41:39.920 --> 3:41:41.240]  This is just an analogy.
[3:41:41.240 --> 3:41:44.920]  Okay, I just want to put this analogy out there because you talk about the Romanian
[3:41:44.920 --> 3:41:47.320]  president and how he had these glowing reviews for Trump.
[3:41:47.320 --> 3:41:50.480]  Yes, you've got all these world leaders that are meeting with Trump that had these glowing
[3:41:50.480 --> 3:41:51.480]  reviews.
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:53.480]  Here's why.
[3:41:53.480 --> 3:41:57.200]  Imagine this again, this is just an analogy before fake news and David Brock try to run
[3:41:57.200 --> 3:41:59.440]  this with any other angle.
[3:41:59.440 --> 3:42:04.200]  Imagine the American people when these foreign leaders come, these presidents, when they come
[3:42:04.200 --> 3:42:09.200]  to sit down with our president, the American people are offering these foreign leaders
[3:42:09.200 --> 3:42:10.720]  a plate of food, okay?
[3:42:10.720 --> 3:42:15.320]  We're offering them, this is our vote, this is who we give to you to represent us, to
[3:42:15.320 --> 3:42:16.320]  meet with us.
[3:42:16.320 --> 3:42:21.440]  Well, for the last eight years, we've been giving them a plate of crap, a plate of feces,
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:23.440]  okay?
[3:42:23.440 --> 3:42:27.840]  So now we finally got the plate of feces out and now we're giving the Romanian president
[3:42:27.840 --> 3:42:30.080]  comes here and you're like, oh boy, I've been looking at a plate of feces here.
[3:42:30.080 --> 3:42:31.560]  This is not beta male.
[3:42:31.560 --> 3:42:33.080]  This is not beta male.
[3:42:33.080 --> 3:42:39.600]  So now we offer him a plate of filet mignon, a nice steak, a nice juicy steak.
[3:42:39.600 --> 3:42:43.920]  And so the Romanian president is like, wow, oh my gosh, they're not serving me crap this
[3:42:43.920 --> 3:42:44.920]  year?
[3:42:44.920 --> 3:42:45.920]  Wow, thank you.
[3:42:45.920 --> 3:42:48.680]  This president Trump is so much better than what I'm used to.
[3:42:48.680 --> 3:42:52.400]  And that's just an analogy, but people really need to understand.
[3:42:52.400 --> 3:42:59.920]  They don't understand how much Barack Obama wanted to take America down, okay?
[3:42:59.920 --> 3:43:01.800]  President Trump wants to lift America up.
[3:43:01.800 --> 3:43:05.240]  That is why they are so diametrically different.
[3:43:05.240 --> 3:43:06.240]  Let's go to the calls.
[3:43:06.240 --> 3:43:11.200]  Let's go to Tom in Oregon, wants to talk about a Trump rally that happened in Oregon.
[3:43:11.200 --> 3:43:12.200]  Go ahead, Tom.
[3:43:12.200 --> 3:43:14.680]  Hey guys, thanks for taking my call.
[3:43:14.680 --> 3:43:19.720]  Yeah, I was just going to call kind of as a testament to your viewers and listeners
[3:43:19.720 --> 3:43:26.280]  about really the power that we at the grassroots hold if we choose to wield it.
[3:43:26.280 --> 3:43:32.440]  So I'm on my citizen journalist here part-time in Portland, Oregon, and just in the past
[3:43:32.440 --> 3:43:37.200]  couple of months that I've been doing that, I've already broken a couple of big stories.
[3:43:37.200 --> 3:43:41.600]  Mike Sternovich broke my story that Jeremy Christian, the Portland Stabber, had shown
[3:43:41.600 --> 3:43:47.480]  up to a Trump, a free speech pro-Trump rally as a scythe to make Trump supporters look
[3:43:47.480 --> 3:43:48.480]  bad.
[3:43:48.480 --> 3:43:50.320]  I'm the one that broke that story to Mike Sternovich.
[3:43:50.320 --> 3:43:54.360]  And I was just talking to Sternovich last night, too.
[3:43:54.360 --> 3:44:01.000]  At the Portland Trump rally, we just had, I went in a CNN, I was covering the event for
[3:44:01.000 --> 3:44:07.280]  my channel, and I made my own CNN as ISIS shirt to trigger people.
[3:44:07.280 --> 3:44:14.600]  And I printed out a thousand flyers with the CNN as ISIS meme with the Kathy Griffin logo.
[3:44:14.600 --> 3:44:17.760]  I put Alex's Twitter and Mike Sternovich's Twitter on there.
[3:44:17.760 --> 3:44:20.440]  The force is strong in this one.
[3:44:20.440 --> 3:44:24.400]  And then I put the QR code for InfoWars on there, too, so people could scan it on their
[3:44:24.400 --> 3:44:32.680]  phones and just go live-time directly to InfoWars, trying to bring that memetic warfare into
[3:44:32.680 --> 3:44:35.840]  the third dimension, just literally hand out memes.
[3:44:35.840 --> 3:44:39.360]  You've done well, Lord Veda.
[3:44:39.360 --> 3:44:41.720]  I handed out over 700 flyers with that event.
[3:44:41.720 --> 3:44:46.080]  And the reason why I thought that was funny, and by the way, I interviewed with, they were
[3:44:46.080 --> 3:44:50.840]  all the media was all over, and interviewed with Al Jazeera, the London Independent, but
[3:44:50.840 --> 3:44:55.440]  I crashed BuzzFeed's live stream for five minutes, and they interviewed me.
[3:44:55.440 --> 3:44:57.600]  And this is what I want to kind of relate to people.
[3:44:57.600 --> 3:45:02.200]  So not only did I go to the event and hand out 700 flyers that basically armed people
[3:45:02.200 --> 3:45:07.920]  now to crash any media outlets that they wanted, because now they have the sign and the information,
[3:45:07.920 --> 3:45:08.920]  and they did.
[3:45:08.920 --> 3:45:11.400]  They crashed all the media outlets at that event.
[3:45:11.400 --> 3:45:18.720]  And then I got on BuzzFeed, the live stream for five minutes, and I knew what they were
[3:45:18.720 --> 3:45:20.040]  going to do.
[3:45:20.040 --> 3:45:25.360]  I knew that they would take the context out of it and then repost the clip, most likely,
[3:45:25.360 --> 3:45:26.360]  which they did.
[3:45:26.360 --> 3:45:32.160]  So I want the InfoWars out there to know how to do this and that this is really the power
[3:45:32.160 --> 3:45:33.160]  we wield.
[3:45:33.160 --> 3:45:35.920]  Well, there's no doubt, I completely agree.
[3:45:35.920 --> 3:45:36.920]  Just taking action.
[3:45:36.920 --> 3:45:37.920]  See, that's the thing.
[3:45:37.920 --> 3:45:42.840]  You have to realize, even in your own walk of life, if you're a teacher, if you work
[3:45:42.840 --> 3:45:47.200]  in the coal mines, whatever it is, not everybody out there is going to be an independent journalist.
[3:45:47.200 --> 3:45:49.240]  Not everybody out there is going to have a YouTube channel.
[3:45:49.240 --> 3:45:52.960]  But there's other things that you can do in your life, just in the classroom, if you're
[3:45:52.960 --> 3:45:55.080]  a teacher, you know, whatever.
[3:45:55.080 --> 3:45:57.360]  You can share things when you're talking at the water cooler.
[3:45:57.360 --> 3:46:00.520]  You know, hey, good thing we got this water here that's purified, so we're not drinking
[3:46:00.520 --> 3:46:01.520]  the fluoride.
[3:46:01.520 --> 3:46:02.520]  So it says fluoride.
[3:46:02.520 --> 3:46:03.520]  What's wrong with that?
[3:46:03.520 --> 3:46:09.440]  So everybody just being, taking action, being awake, being aware, caring about the fellow
[3:46:09.440 --> 3:46:13.640]  human being, wanting to have conversation, not being scared that you're going to be
[3:46:13.640 --> 3:46:15.640]  looked at funny for your right to free speech.
[3:46:15.640 --> 3:46:17.040]  I completely agree with you.
[3:46:17.040 --> 3:46:18.560]  Thank you, Tom and Orgen, for calling in.
[3:46:18.560 --> 3:46:20.880]  I just got to break in here with this.
[3:46:20.880 --> 3:46:21.880]  Here's an article.
[3:46:21.880 --> 3:46:26.160]  This is on CBS News, cops release all Manchester concert bombing suspects.
[3:46:26.160 --> 3:46:27.160]  Every single one.
[3:46:27.160 --> 3:46:28.160]  Can you believe it?
[3:46:28.160 --> 3:46:29.680]  I couldn't believe it.
[3:46:29.680 --> 3:46:33.160]  There was a video before the bombing happened saying, look out.
[3:46:33.160 --> 3:46:34.160]  What's going to happen?
[3:46:34.160 --> 3:46:36.000]  Let me go to the headline right there.
[3:46:36.000 --> 3:46:38.000]  There it is.
[3:46:38.000 --> 3:46:42.240]  And somebody tweeted this to me and it was some alternative media news site.
[3:46:42.240 --> 3:46:43.240]  And I'm like, let me go.
[3:46:43.240 --> 3:46:45.360]  Let me just check some other side.
[3:46:45.360 --> 3:46:46.480]  There was four of them.
[3:46:46.480 --> 3:46:47.960]  That was the one I ended on.
[3:46:47.960 --> 3:46:49.400]  I'm like, I can't believe this.
[3:46:49.400 --> 3:46:54.440]  How can you release these people without full body cavity searches as far as I'm concerned?
[3:46:54.440 --> 3:46:56.240]  You know, and there was amazing.
[3:46:56.240 --> 3:47:01.160]  There was some other similar story to where it was like, you know, they, that's okay.
[3:47:01.160 --> 3:47:07.240]  They come in, they make these bombs that are amazing in their, you know, potency and power
[3:47:07.240 --> 3:47:08.240]  and sophistication.
[3:47:08.240 --> 3:47:11.720]  No, it's just a 16 year old kid who did it.
[3:47:11.720 --> 3:47:12.720]  Don't worry.
[3:47:12.720 --> 3:47:13.720]  Don't worry.
[3:47:13.720 --> 3:47:14.720]  We got him.
[3:47:14.720 --> 3:47:15.720]  We got him all.
[3:47:15.720 --> 3:47:16.720]  He killed himself.
[3:47:16.720 --> 3:47:17.720]  I mean, that is just insane.
[3:47:17.720 --> 3:47:22.720]  You know, and if any one of those suspects, you know, commits an act of terror or murders
[3:47:22.720 --> 3:47:23.720]  it'll be okay.
[3:47:23.720 --> 3:47:24.720]  It'll be okay.
[3:47:24.720 --> 3:47:27.280]  My I mean, strong Britons.
[3:47:27.280 --> 3:47:30.760]  I hope that that's not the police's decision because that would look real bad on the police.
[3:47:30.760 --> 3:47:34.360]  My guess is the police didn't want to release him and they got, they had that calling from
[3:47:34.360 --> 3:47:36.600]  their political correct leaders at the top.
[3:47:36.600 --> 3:47:37.840]  Let's go back out to the phone lines.
[3:47:37.840 --> 3:47:40.440]  Let's go to Morgan, who is also an organ.
[3:47:40.440 --> 3:47:45.240]  Go ahead, Morgan.
[3:47:45.240 --> 3:47:48.400]  Do we have Morgan?
[3:47:48.400 --> 3:47:50.120]  Come on, Morgan.
[3:47:50.120 --> 3:47:51.120]  Okay.
[3:47:51.120 --> 3:47:53.040]  Thank you for the call, Morgan.
[3:47:53.040 --> 3:47:56.040]  Let's go to Sam in South Carolina wants to talk.
[3:47:56.040 --> 3:47:57.040]  Call me.
[3:47:57.040 --> 3:47:58.040]  Go ahead, Sam.
[3:47:58.040 --> 3:47:59.040]  Hey there.
[3:47:59.040 --> 3:48:00.040]  How's it going, Owen?
[3:48:00.040 --> 3:48:01.040]  How's it going?
[3:48:01.040 --> 3:48:02.040]  The legendary Rob Do.
[3:48:02.040 --> 3:48:03.040]  The legendary.
[3:48:03.040 --> 3:48:04.040]  Yes.
[3:48:04.040 --> 3:48:08.880]  Well, I'm a first-time caller, you know, long-time listener, been listening for the past five
[3:48:08.880 --> 3:48:09.880]  years.
[3:48:09.880 --> 3:48:15.240]  You know, after being downrange with the army, kind of saw a lot of discrepancies between
[3:48:15.240 --> 3:48:20.040]  what was going on and what was being reported.
[3:48:20.040 --> 3:48:22.200]  And it's kind of what kind of woke me up.
[3:48:22.200 --> 3:48:27.040]  And then I started researching alternative media to try and figure out what's really
[3:48:27.040 --> 3:48:28.960]  going on out there.
[3:48:28.960 --> 3:48:34.280]  But outside of all that, I mean, InfoWars is definitely a red pill in my brain.
[3:48:34.280 --> 3:48:39.600]  And I just want to thank you guys for waking up the Patriots in our country and all around
[3:48:39.600 --> 3:48:40.600]  the world.
[3:48:40.600 --> 3:48:43.080]  Well, thank you for spreading the word.
[3:48:43.080 --> 3:48:44.080]  Yeah.
[3:48:44.080 --> 3:48:45.080]  Absolutely.
[3:48:45.080 --> 3:48:50.760]  Anyways, as far as Trump emptying the swamp, I mean, I think we're only just, you know,
[3:48:50.760 --> 3:48:52.000]  getting into the second inning.
[3:48:52.000 --> 3:48:58.080]  So, in my opinion, you know, the testimony of Comey was, I mean, from what I heard, the
[3:48:58.080 --> 3:49:04.280]  complete exoneration of Trump, but what is, you know how media is taking it and spending
[3:49:04.280 --> 3:49:08.840]  every word that's being said from what we say to something completely different.
[3:49:08.840 --> 3:49:13.040]  And I'm wondering, what is it that they're actually trying to distract us from?
[3:49:13.040 --> 3:49:16.720]  Because they're trying to put us in this like micro view of what's going on.
[3:49:16.720 --> 3:49:19.160]  You know, I always think about that.
[3:49:19.160 --> 3:49:20.160]  That's a great point.
[3:49:20.160 --> 3:49:22.600]  I always try to look at the story that they're not talking about.
[3:49:22.600 --> 3:49:23.600]  And I think that-
[3:49:23.600 --> 3:49:24.600]  Seth Rich.
[3:49:24.600 --> 3:49:26.840]  Well, Seth Rich, even though we are talking about that.
[3:49:26.840 --> 3:49:31.840]  I think that it's an overall, like, I think it's an overall consortium of things.
[3:49:31.840 --> 3:49:36.560]  Like, oh, Trump, Russia, Trump, Russia, well, it's them and Russia, okay?
[3:49:36.560 --> 3:49:38.200]  They were the ones that colluded with Russia.
[3:49:38.200 --> 3:49:42.680]  So basically, everything that they're throwing against the wall right now, everything that
[3:49:42.680 --> 3:49:46.640]  they're trying to stick against Trump is what they're guilty of.
[3:49:46.640 --> 3:49:47.640]  The Trump troll army.
[3:49:47.640 --> 3:49:48.640]  The Trump troll army.
[3:49:48.640 --> 3:49:51.480]  Trump likes to have people pee on him in hotels.
[3:49:51.480 --> 3:49:52.920]  They're probably into that crap.
[3:49:52.920 --> 3:49:55.480]  They're the ones that do the spirit cooking.
[3:49:55.480 --> 3:49:56.800]  So that's the story.
[3:49:56.800 --> 3:49:57.800]  That's the cover-up.
[3:49:57.800 --> 3:50:02.640]  Everything they're pushing on Trump, the Trump Russia, we like Peagate, all this weird stuff,
[3:50:02.640 --> 3:50:05.160]  that is actually what they're distracting us from.
[3:50:05.160 --> 3:50:10.200]  Yeah, because think of it, like, he's, like, so suspectably through himself, Attorney General
[3:50:10.200 --> 3:50:13.880]  Lynch and Hillary under the bus so quickly.
[3:50:13.880 --> 3:50:19.680]  And the mainstream media straighten all this drama from every angle, alluding to collusion
[3:50:19.680 --> 3:50:21.240]  to cover up from something bigger.
[3:50:21.240 --> 3:50:24.160]  And I really think that they, I think that they've lost themselves.
[3:50:24.160 --> 3:50:27.560]  I really think that they've spun a web so tight that they can't even move because they
[3:50:27.560 --> 3:50:28.960]  don't even get it.
[3:50:28.960 --> 3:50:34.520]  Let's not forget, months ago, the entire left wanted Comey's head.
[3:50:34.520 --> 3:50:36.640]  They wanted Comey's head.
[3:50:36.640 --> 3:50:37.800]  Then Trump fires him.
[3:50:37.800 --> 3:50:38.800]  They love Comey.
[3:50:38.800 --> 3:50:41.760]  Then he gives a testimony damning himself.
[3:50:41.760 --> 3:50:44.120]  They have spun a web and they cannot get out of it.
[3:50:44.120 --> 3:50:46.320]  It's a web of lies, lies, folks.
[3:50:46.320 --> 3:50:48.680]  Final segment of the Alex Jones show, your calls on the other side.
[3:50:48.680 --> 3:50:49.680]  I want to show you Rob do.
[3:50:49.680 --> 3:51:01.200]  We've got Boom Boom and Stephanie coming up.
[3:51:01.200 --> 3:51:04.640]  I love sporting events, the atmosphere, the crowd.
[3:51:04.640 --> 3:51:09.440]  I even enjoy waiting in line because while I'm standing next to you, the RFID scanner
[3:51:09.440 --> 3:51:15.840]  in my pocket is capturing your personal information from debit and credit cards, even your apartment
[3:51:15.840 --> 3:51:22.400]  building key, so you'll still be paying for this game long after it's over.
[3:51:22.400 --> 3:51:25.080]  Every two seconds, someone is a victim of identity fraud.
[3:51:25.080 --> 3:51:29.000]  This Father's Day, protect dad from crimes he can't see with ID stronghold wallets in
[3:51:29.000 --> 3:51:33.840]  all dad's favorite styles, bifold, trifold, and even front pocket wallets and money clips.
[3:51:33.840 --> 3:51:37.720]  ID stronghold pioneered RFID blocking technology over 10 years ago.
[3:51:37.720 --> 3:51:41.640]  ID stronghold wallets look great and even cost about the same as wallets in most stores.
[3:51:41.640 --> 3:51:45.000]  I'm Wal Augustinowitz, founder and CEO of ID stronghold.
[3:51:45.000 --> 3:51:47.680]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID stronghold.
[3:51:47.680 --> 3:51:52.200]  For Father's Day, go to idstronghold.com and get a free mini wallet with purchase of any
[3:51:52.200 --> 3:51:54.680]  wallet order over $20.
[3:51:54.680 --> 3:51:58.680]  ID stronghold.com.
[3:51:58.680 --> 3:52:03.040]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[3:52:03.040 --> 3:52:07.740]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:52:07.740 --> 3:52:09.240]  to detoxify the body.
[3:52:09.240 --> 3:52:14.080]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[3:52:14.080 --> 3:52:15.640]  It's made in the USA.
[3:52:15.640 --> 3:52:20.520]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[3:52:20.520 --> 3:52:22.360]  the body and it supports the info war.
[3:52:22.360 --> 3:52:24.600]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:52:24.600 --> 3:52:29.080]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[3:52:29.080 --> 3:52:33.680]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[3:52:33.680 --> 3:52:34.680]  get.
[3:52:34.680 --> 3:52:37.920]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[3:52:37.920 --> 3:52:42.920]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[3:52:42.920 --> 3:52:48.120]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[3:52:48.120 --> 3:52:51.920]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[3:52:51.920 --> 3:52:52.920]  prayers together.
[3:52:52.920 --> 3:52:53.920]  We're changing the world.
[3:52:53.920 --> 3:52:58.200]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield in FullWarsLife.com.
[3:52:58.200 --> 3:53:00.760]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[3:53:00.760 --> 3:53:02.920]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[3:53:02.920 --> 3:53:05.080]  Are you happy paying high prices?

[3:53:18.120 --> 3:53:21.680]  You're getting soap products twice as good as what you're using now.
[3:53:21.680 --> 3:53:23.920]  Earth friendly and natural soaps.
[3:53:23.920 --> 3:53:26.000]  Your family deserves the best.

[3:54:06.960 --> 3:54:10.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, Oren Shroyer, Rob Dew with you for the final segment.
[3:54:10.320 --> 3:54:14.840]  And again, folks, I just have to implore you infowarstore.com.
[3:54:14.840 --> 3:54:15.840]  Just try one product.
[3:54:15.840 --> 3:54:18.480]  If you haven't tried a product yet, just try one product.
[3:54:18.480 --> 3:54:19.680]  Support this broadcast.
[3:54:19.680 --> 3:54:21.200]  Help us grow to the next level.
[3:54:21.200 --> 3:54:22.360]  Alex is not joking around.
[3:54:22.360 --> 3:54:24.960]  He really is building another new studio.
[3:54:24.960 --> 3:54:29.480]  He really is hiring more people, but he wants to make sure he has the funds to do it right
[3:54:29.480 --> 3:54:31.040]  so that we don't collapse on ourselves.
[3:54:31.040 --> 3:54:35.160]  So that all comes from you going to infowarstore.com.
[3:54:35.160 --> 3:54:40.440]  We've got great specials going right now, 33% off, super blue, fluoride free toothpaste.
[3:54:40.440 --> 3:54:42.680]  My guess is you'll be like me.
[3:54:42.680 --> 3:54:46.800]  You'll use this toothpaste once and it'll be the last toothpaste you ever use because
[3:54:46.800 --> 3:54:48.240]  it is the best.
[3:54:48.240 --> 3:54:49.760]  Rob, you want to bring in our next caller?
[3:54:49.760 --> 3:54:50.760]  Sure.
[3:54:50.760 --> 3:54:53.240]  We'll bring in Boom Boom in one second, but I just want to say this.
[3:54:53.240 --> 3:54:58.080]  The first initial designs for the studio, John said, nope, too small.
[3:54:58.080 --> 3:54:59.840]  I want it bigger than this one.
[3:54:59.840 --> 3:55:00.840]  More.
[3:55:00.840 --> 3:55:02.440]  So we definitely need your support.
[3:55:02.440 --> 3:55:04.880]  We're going to make a bigger studio than this one.
[3:55:04.880 --> 3:55:05.880]  Guys, go to camera five.
[3:55:05.880 --> 3:55:07.160]  Just show people how big this studio.
[3:55:07.160 --> 3:55:08.320]  This is a big studio.
[3:55:08.320 --> 3:55:11.800]  This actually used to be the main room where we all sat.
[3:55:11.800 --> 3:55:15.480]  We had a huge group of reporters and editors in here, and we're going to build a studio
[3:55:15.480 --> 3:55:16.600]  bigger than this one.
[3:55:16.600 --> 3:55:17.600]  So please support us.
[3:55:17.600 --> 3:55:18.600]  Thank you for your support.
[3:55:18.600 --> 3:55:20.160]  Let's go to Boom Boom in Arizona.
[3:55:20.160 --> 3:55:22.040]  Let's talk about the travel band cords.
[3:55:22.040 --> 3:55:23.040]  Go ahead, Boom Boom.
[3:55:23.040 --> 3:55:25.040]  Thanks for taking my call.
[3:55:25.040 --> 3:55:29.440]  I've got three ideas about what the global is going to tailspin.
[3:55:29.440 --> 3:55:31.680]  All right, go ahead.
[3:55:31.680 --> 3:55:38.920]  What this travel band that keeps getting overturned, if that's the case, President Trump should
[3:55:38.920 --> 3:55:41.600]  just repeal the Patriot Act.
[3:55:41.600 --> 3:55:42.600]  I like that.
[3:55:42.600 --> 3:55:43.600]  I like that.
[3:55:43.600 --> 3:55:48.440]  It's actually within the NDAA, too, that the president has the power to take out the
[3:55:48.440 --> 3:55:49.440]  NDAA as well.
[3:55:49.440 --> 3:55:53.440]  But of course, it's the NDAA that would give him the right, I guess, to persecute all these
[3:55:53.440 --> 3:55:54.440]  terrorists here.
[3:55:54.440 --> 3:55:55.440]  Kind of a catch-22.
[3:55:55.440 --> 3:55:56.440]  Yeah.
[3:55:56.440 --> 3:55:57.440]  I like that.
[3:55:57.440 --> 3:55:58.440]  Yeah.
[3:55:58.440 --> 3:56:01.800]  I agree completely.
[3:56:01.800 --> 3:56:02.800]  Use their poison against them.
[3:56:02.800 --> 3:56:04.280]  I think you're 100 percent right.
[3:56:04.280 --> 3:56:05.480]  What's number two?
[3:56:05.480 --> 3:56:11.080]  Number two, this will bankrupt the globalists.
[3:56:11.080 --> 3:56:16.920]  Re-institute JFK's executive order, 11,110.
[3:56:16.920 --> 3:56:17.920]  Silver certificate.
[3:56:17.920 --> 3:56:18.920]  Yeah.
[3:56:18.920 --> 3:56:19.920]  That's what got him killed.
[3:56:19.920 --> 3:56:20.920]  All right.
[3:56:20.920 --> 3:56:21.920]  What's your third one?
[3:56:21.920 --> 3:56:34.000]  Third one is Comey under oath if he was aware he was appointed by a guy with a fake ID.
[3:56:34.000 --> 3:56:35.000]  That's pretty good.
[3:56:35.000 --> 3:56:39.880]  Hey, a lot of people are talking about, oh, they put this 10-year rule in so the FBI director
[3:56:39.880 --> 3:56:41.280]  wouldn't be, would be nonpartisan.
[3:56:41.280 --> 3:56:46.040]  No, they did that because Jager Hoover was like the FBI director for almost 30 years
[3:56:46.040 --> 3:56:48.520]  and they're like, look, we don't want another guy in there who has all this power who's
[3:56:48.520 --> 3:56:49.760]  blackmailing us.
[3:56:49.760 --> 3:56:50.760]  That's why they did it.
[3:56:50.760 --> 3:56:54.480]  They did it for self-preservation, not for this nonpartisan BS they keep talking about.
[3:56:54.480 --> 3:56:57.160]  You know, Donald Trump likes gold so much.
[3:56:57.160 --> 3:57:00.360]  I think Donald Trump can start looking into where all the gold from Fort Knox went.
[3:57:00.360 --> 3:57:01.520]  I think that'd be a nice place.
[3:57:01.520 --> 3:57:03.840]  Let's take one more call before we get off the air here.
[3:57:03.840 --> 3:57:05.120]  Stephanie in Ohio.
[3:57:05.120 --> 3:57:06.120]  Go ahead, Stephanie.
[3:57:06.120 --> 3:57:07.120]  You got a minute.
[3:57:07.120 --> 3:57:08.120]  I'm in Idaho.
[3:57:08.120 --> 3:57:09.120]  All right.
[3:57:09.120 --> 3:57:10.120]  Stephanie in Idaho.
[3:57:10.120 --> 3:57:14.760]  There's a lot of things I'd like to talk to.
[3:57:14.760 --> 3:57:19.560]  I want to thank you guys for all the information you guys get out to us.
[3:57:19.560 --> 3:57:23.360]  You got 60 seconds for information.
[3:57:23.360 --> 3:57:29.160]  And I just want to say that it's happening in our small towns, this globalist and stuff.
[3:57:29.160 --> 3:57:34.560]  I live close to Twin Falls and we've got to fight this and we've got to fight it hard.
[3:57:34.560 --> 3:57:39.120]  People have got to get all of their congressmen and just keep fighting because if we don't,
[3:57:39.120 --> 3:57:40.400]  we're going to lose it.
[3:57:40.400 --> 3:57:43.000]  And Donald Trump, clear the swamp.
[3:57:43.000 --> 3:57:47.080]  You've got the, we put you in office to clean the swamp.
[3:57:47.080 --> 3:57:48.520]  That's why we put you there.
[3:57:48.520 --> 3:57:50.120]  That's why we did it.
[3:57:50.120 --> 3:57:53.280]  And we want you to clean that swamp and get those people out of there.
[3:57:53.280 --> 3:57:54.280]  Just do it.
[3:57:54.280 --> 3:57:55.280]  Get them all out of there.
[3:57:55.280 --> 3:57:56.280]  I completely agree.
[3:57:56.280 --> 3:57:59.680]  And now you've got McMaster, who's appointing more swamp members.
[3:57:59.680 --> 3:58:05.120]  McMaster appoints Eric Karm Ciaramella, who's a Susan Rice ally.
[3:58:05.120 --> 3:58:07.720]  So yeah, I completely agree with you, Stephanie.
[3:58:07.720 --> 3:58:09.880]  But you know, like the one caller said, it's still early.
[3:58:09.880 --> 3:58:11.360]  I think it's still like the first inning.
[3:58:11.360 --> 3:58:13.560]  So I think Trump has a lot of it bats left.
[3:58:13.560 --> 3:58:14.800]  What do you think, Rob?
[3:58:14.800 --> 3:58:16.840]  I like the idea to repeal the Patriot Act.
[3:58:16.840 --> 3:58:17.840]  That's great.
[3:58:17.840 --> 3:58:20.440]  And with the TSA, we wouldn't have to get fondled just to get on an airplane.
[3:58:20.440 --> 3:58:21.440]  Yeah.
[3:58:21.440 --> 3:58:22.440]  Look at the swamp that he's drained so far.
[3:58:22.440 --> 3:58:23.440]  TPP.
[3:58:23.440 --> 3:58:24.440]  Which hasn't caught one terrorist, by the way.
[3:58:24.440 --> 3:58:25.440]  Gone.
[3:58:25.440 --> 3:58:26.440]  TPP.
[3:58:26.440 --> 3:58:27.440]  Gone.
[3:58:27.440 --> 3:58:28.440]  Climate a deal.
[3:58:28.440 --> 3:58:29.440]  Gone.
[3:58:29.440 --> 3:58:30.440]  Okay.
[3:58:30.440 --> 3:58:31.440]  These are great things.
[3:58:31.440 --> 3:58:32.440]  This is how you drain the swamp.
[3:58:32.440 --> 3:58:33.440]  FBI director.
[3:58:33.440 --> 3:58:34.440]  Gone.
[3:58:34.440 --> 3:58:35.440]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[3:58:35.440 --> 3:58:36.440]  Infowars nightly news tonight, 7 p.m.
