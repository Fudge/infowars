[08:17.880 --> 08:24.600]  2010 the next 50 minutes or so in this hour we're joined by the co-author of
[08:24.600 --> 08:28.920]  several of Jesse Ventura's books Dick Russell he also wrote the best-seller
[08:28.920 --> 08:33.440]  don't start the revolution without me when I got an advanced copy of this book
[08:33.440 --> 08:38.000]  a month ago I was very impressed with it I think it's Ventura's best book and
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.640]  I've read don't have time to bleed and I've also read of course don't start
[08:42.640 --> 08:46.720]  revolution without me I remember four years ago giving Ventura my documentary
[08:46.720 --> 08:51.760]  films he said yeah my son's already educated me some on this but I'm very
[08:51.760 --> 08:58.560]  honored to be at least part of Ventura's latest education in reality he's
[08:58.560 --> 09:03.360]  always been a rebel always question the system an amazing individual so I don't
[09:03.360 --> 09:06.840]  want to say that Ventura's son and myself woke him up but we certainly
[09:06.840 --> 09:13.000]  contributed to him having a crash course in the true reality that the
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.840]  establishment media calls conspiracy theory I mean I remember 2002 I was
[09:17.840 --> 09:21.480]  saying Saddam didn't have WMD's I was having former weapons inspectors on
[09:21.480 --> 09:27.880]  former top CIA analyst on Iraq on and the media was calling me and my and other
[09:27.880 --> 09:34.520]  guest conspiracy theorist and I mean here's an ABC news article I was on a
[09:34.520 --> 09:38.720]  roller-rovera Saturday US military wanted to provoke war with Cuba military
[09:38.720 --> 09:42.560]  drafted plans to terrorize US cities to provoke war with Cuba stage terror
[09:42.560 --> 09:47.600]  attacks stage shootings bombings hijacked jets by remote control and I
[09:47.600 --> 09:52.280]  held up the actual operation Northwoods document vacuuming a document cam shot
[09:52.280 --> 09:57.280]  on that guys for the prison planet dot TV viewers and I held up Northwoods I
[09:57.280 --> 10:00.880]  held up ABC news and her all those co-hosts just said I was a conspiracy
[10:00.880 --> 10:04.000]  theorist she said how dare you make these allegations these are not
[10:04.000 --> 10:12.080]  allegations right here I've got a army field manual army field manual FM dash
[10:12.080 --> 10:17.760]  31 dash 20 dash 3 how to stage terror attacks this was in use from 1994 to
[10:17.760 --> 10:25.360]  2004 army field manual I mean here's ABC news stage terror attack plans but they
[10:25.360 --> 10:28.240]  don't care they just call the conspiracy theory and I've been watching
[10:28.240 --> 10:33.360]  Ventura on on the today show and on other programs we've got them posted up
[10:33.360 --> 10:38.200]  an info wars dot com and prison planet dot com all those different videos and
[10:38.200 --> 10:41.720]  they always say well this is your opinion or this is your conspiracy theory
[10:41.720 --> 10:46.600]  and Ventura says no I may speculate the starting or the end of a chapter but
[10:46.600 --> 10:50.560]  everything in here is government documents and provable information and it is
[10:50.560 --> 10:55.520]  an encyclopedia of really Ventura's research and Dick Russell's research as
[10:55.520 --> 11:02.080]  well Dick's been researching true reality for a long time so I want to walk
[11:02.080 --> 11:05.000]  through some of the chapters and for the rest of the hour Dick Russell and the
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.080]  censorship by the Huffington Post but I want to just add this book is available

[12:21.600 --> 12:26.960]  reading notes this is Jesse Ventura's best book in my opinion and we are very
[12:26.960 --> 12:32.560]  honored to have Dick Russell co-author and researcher with Ventura on with us
[12:32.560 --> 12:38.120]  dick good to have you here thanks Alex good to be with you today is this your
[12:38.120 --> 12:43.800]  favorite Ventura book well I really enjoyed working with him on his the
[12:43.800 --> 12:48.240]  autobiography the memoir of his years as governor and then what happened after
[12:48.240 --> 12:52.840]  that when he went to Harvard and and was you know censored basically taken off
[12:52.840 --> 12:56.520]  the air at MSNBC because he was quote-to-controversial I mean that was a
[12:56.520 --> 13:00.360]  lot of fun and that was the book that don't start the revolution without me
[13:00.360 --> 13:05.040]  but this one American conspiracies that is really close to my heart and his and
[13:05.040 --> 13:10.320]  and for many many years I've been been researching saving material on these
[13:10.320 --> 13:15.080]  subjects and did some fresh interviews along with Jesse did also for this book
[13:15.080 --> 13:20.880]  and so yeah I mean I'm thrilled to have it out there and he's a he's masterful
[13:20.880 --> 13:25.920]  on TV and believes deeply in that we've got to get the truth out about a lot of
[13:25.920 --> 13:29.200]  the things that the government's been covering up for many many years and so
[13:29.200 --> 13:34.280]  it's great to have collaborated with him on this well dick this is a hard core
[13:34.280 --> 13:38.320]  book I mean I've read it now almost twice I've almost gone through it a
[13:38.320 --> 13:42.600]  second time and I agree with the analysis in this book there's deep research
[13:42.600 --> 13:47.080]  here because I've been researching this for 16 years 14 on air and you know I'm
[13:47.080 --> 13:52.600]  kind of a one of the grand Pubos of this whole quote genre as the media would
[13:52.600 --> 13:57.440]  call it it's really just investigating reality and I mean you guys aren't
[13:57.440 --> 14:01.680]  pulling any punches here and we see Jesse Ventura getting more and more
[14:01.680 --> 14:10.640]  hardcore I mean that's the only word well yeah I mean he is it's a kind of
[14:10.640 --> 14:14.640]  scary to me I mean the fact that when you look at the history of the last you
[14:14.640 --> 14:19.840]  know especially 40 50 years really starting you know with the CIA getting
[14:19.840 --> 14:23.600]  so much power in the 50s but then with the Kennedy assassination on through
[14:23.600 --> 14:28.160]  these various events and you look at what's really been really been going on
[14:28.160 --> 14:32.800]  in the country leading up you know finally culminating with the the years of
[14:32.800 --> 14:36.960]  George W. Bush and and the two stolen elections and nearly a third and then
[14:36.960 --> 14:43.200]  the cover-up around 9-11 and I mean it's it's a it is indeed heavy-duty and I
[14:43.200 --> 14:47.560]  know that Jesse told me at one point that that his wife Terry was kind of
[14:47.560 --> 14:52.120]  scared by the whole thing and and you know but I feel like it's crucially
[14:52.120 --> 14:56.760]  important for the American people to to take an alternative view to realize that
[14:56.760 --> 15:01.880]  what we're what we've been told all these years is not necessarily the
[15:01.880 --> 15:04.960]  accurate truth only read in the history books what the kids are being taught and
[15:04.960 --> 15:10.800]  so you know it's time for time for this alternative picture to emerge and for
[15:10.800 --> 15:17.680]  people to start raising questions that they they hadn't had before well cutting
[15:17.680 --> 15:22.120]  right to the bone here the establishment in literally hundreds of
[15:22.120 --> 15:25.920]  publications a week and I'm sure you've noticed this dick is panicking they're
[15:25.920 --> 15:30.880]  saying these conspiracy people are taking over the whole culture it's crazy
[15:30.880 --> 15:34.680]  no one believes the mainstream media or the government anymore these people are
[15:34.680 --> 15:39.320]  nuts there's no world government there's no government drug dealing there's no
[15:39.320 --> 15:43.760]  lying about WMD's and they're only digging the hole deeper for themselves
[15:43.760 --> 15:49.520]  they can't set the parameters of reality anymore and and so there's a total
[15:49.520 --> 15:53.960]  loss of confidence in the system and the system is only resorting to more name
[15:53.960 --> 15:59.080]  calling and that that old trick of calling its conspiracy theorist isn't
[15:59.080 --> 16:03.000]  working anymore well yeah I think that's true I mean starting with the Kennedy
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.680]  assassination where you know you have all these these the only books that are
[16:06.680 --> 16:10.320]  gonna get reviewed by the establishment media are the ones that come out and say
[16:10.320 --> 16:13.720]  that yeah the Warren Commission was right and Oswald did it alone but the
[16:13.720 --> 16:18.160]  fact is so I think of the last figure I saw was 75 to 90 percent of the American
[16:18.160 --> 16:21.600]  people don't believe that but they know it was some kind of conspiracy and you
[16:21.600 --> 16:25.560]  start there with this terrible event that really changed the course of
[16:25.560 --> 16:30.240]  American history back in 1963 and you go on up to today and and you know the
[16:30.240 --> 16:34.760]  fact is the public is getting wise to this and and and yet the media of
[16:34.760 --> 16:38.600]  course are gonna continue to which are mostly corporate owned as I'm sure most
[16:38.600 --> 16:42.840]  of your listeners know are gonna continue to promulgate to promulgate the
[16:42.840 --> 16:48.400]  fact or not the fact but promulgating the notion the false notion that none of
[16:48.400 --> 16:53.560]  these things have ever happened now did you work on this book in the US with
[16:53.560 --> 16:56.680]  Ventura or did you do this down at the beach it seems he told me you were down
[16:56.680 --> 17:02.120]  there visiting with him in Mexico yeah well both I I've been especially for
[17:02.120 --> 17:06.200]  our first book together we did a lot of that in Mexico I would go to the I have
[17:06.200 --> 17:09.200]  a place there my friends do that I stayed and sometimes in the winter and
[17:09.200 --> 17:13.680]  and was there for six months for the first book and we would meet every week
[17:13.680 --> 17:16.880]  and I would interview him and then transcribe the tapes and we put the
[17:16.880 --> 17:20.440]  book together like that for this book I did more of it in the US because this
[17:20.440 --> 17:24.360]  is where my files are and then you know I would communicate on the phone and I
[17:24.360 --> 17:29.000]  would go out to Minneapolis in this case that area where he lives and we
[17:29.000 --> 17:35.960]  would go over things together when we were shooting conspiracy theory out in
[17:35.960 --> 17:39.440]  California I came into the hotel and was checking in and Ventura came up
[17:39.440 --> 17:43.680]  behind me was checking at the same time and and we were talking and he said
[17:43.680 --> 17:48.200]  Alex I just got back from Alaska my head is spinning this stuff just gets
[17:48.200 --> 17:53.480]  deeper and deeper and again I mean Ventura 30 years ago knew about the JFK
[17:53.480 --> 17:58.560]  situation so it's not like he's just now waking up but to see him opening up to
[17:58.560 --> 18:02.640]  the full research and really digging into it he told me that when he's down in
[18:02.640 --> 18:09.000]  Mexico he on average reads 15 books or so and Jesse really is becoming a what
[18:09.000 --> 18:12.800]  the media would call a conspiracy theorist well I guess that's true of
[18:12.800 --> 18:16.760]  course you know as he said and I'm sure he'll tell you when you have my later
[18:16.760 --> 18:21.560]  in the week you know he's what he wants is the fact that in a hundred years from
[18:21.560 --> 18:26.760]  now when people people realize that there was an alternative view then then
[18:26.760 --> 18:31.240]  what we're getting in the Orwellian history books and you know and he's
[18:31.240 --> 18:35.160]  very dedicated you know reader I mean he does indeed studies that he's an
[18:35.160 --> 18:40.400]  extremely intelligent man he's a very creative thinker clearly you know far
[18:40.400 --> 18:43.480]  beyond most people who've been in just the wrestling arena otherwise it would
[18:43.480 --> 18:47.600]  never have been elected governor of Minnesota and and so he really does pay
[18:47.600 --> 18:53.120]  attention to to to these things and and you know I think is it's making a real
[18:53.120 --> 18:59.520]  difference with putting his views out there well I have a variant on that and
[18:59.520 --> 19:02.360]  that's what I told Texas Monthly in this month's issue at the end of the
[19:02.360 --> 19:06.680]  article I don't just want people in a hundred years and that's important I want
[19:06.680 --> 19:11.960]  people in 20 years because we lay out just how illegitimate and unaccountable
[19:11.960 --> 19:16.400]  this power structure is globally that as things get worse and worse we put out
[19:16.400 --> 19:20.680]  an alternative view of what really happened so that people understand the
[19:20.680 --> 19:23.920]  type of tyranny and corruption we're dealing with so we have a chance to
[19:23.920 --> 19:27.400]  remove it well of course so do I otherwise there's no reason to do the
[19:27.400 --> 19:31.520]  book really now I mean you know the book is hopefully going to catch the
[19:31.520 --> 19:35.160]  attention of a lot of people and make people think in a different way than
[19:35.160 --> 19:40.400]  maybe they did before they read it and sure I'm hoping that that's true as we
[19:40.400 --> 19:45.040]  speak Dick Russell co-author researcher with Jesse Ventura on the new
[19:45.040 --> 19:50.160]  already bestseller American conspiracies number seven on the Amazon

[24:09.360 --> 24:14.560]  Dick Russell Jesse Ventura New York Times best-selling author American
[24:14.560 --> 24:18.400]  conspiracies he's our guest I want to get into different chapters in the book
[24:18.400 --> 24:21.120]  with you dick today and I appreciate you spending time with us and all your
[24:21.120 --> 24:25.920]  busy but I was pretty well actually I wasn't that shocked but when you emailed
[24:25.920 --> 24:29.160]  us yesterday to let us know I appreciate you doing that that the
[24:29.160 --> 24:34.440]  Huffington Post had sent the Ventura article into the Orwellian memory hole
[24:34.440 --> 24:39.600]  what happened there yeah it was a very bizarre to me very bizarre thing that
[24:39.600 --> 24:43.840]  happened the Huffington Post had asked for for a series of you know pieces with
[24:43.840 --> 24:47.680]  it to run with excerpts from the book over the next couple of weeks and the
[24:47.680 --> 24:53.280]  first one was fine it was about you know the whole drug situation and and of
[24:53.280 --> 24:57.640]  course Jesse has commented publicly that he'd like to see marijuana legalized
[24:57.640 --> 25:02.480]  for example and you know it would take care of a lot of the problems with that
[25:02.480 --> 25:07.400]  we're seeing with big money and all of that but what happened with the second
[25:07.400 --> 25:11.320]  piece the second piece was on was called what really happened on September 11th
[25:11.320 --> 25:16.720]  and the intro to it was simply reporting the fact and Jesse and I worked on this
[25:16.720 --> 25:19.840]  together that you know while you didn't see anything about it in the mainstream
[25:19.840 --> 25:23.640]  media there was this conference in San Francisco a couple weeks ago where more
[25:23.640 --> 25:27.680]  than a thousand architects and engineers signed a petition demanding that
[25:27.680 --> 25:31.920]  Congress started new investigation into the destruction of the three the twin
[25:31.920 --> 25:35.920]  towers and building seven on September 11th okay and then it cuts to an excerpt
[25:35.920 --> 25:39.120]  from the book getting into the just raising the question you know could
[25:39.120 --> 25:43.480]  there have been something other than those hijacked planes that brought down
[25:43.480 --> 25:48.480]  the towers and could there have been control demolition involved okay so this
[25:48.480 --> 25:53.600]  gets this goes up on the Huffington Post yesterday morning on the front section
[25:53.600 --> 25:58.080]  picture me and Jesse and then in the toward the then suddenly later in the
[25:58.080 --> 26:01.880]  morning it's moved to the back and I went to check it I don't know around 11
[26:01.880 --> 26:05.880]  o'clock in the morning yesterday and there was this disclaimer and it said
[26:05.880 --> 26:09.720]  editors note the Huffington Post editorial policy laid out in our blogger
[26:09.720 --> 26:13.280]  guidelines prohibits the promotion and promulgation of conspiracy theories
[26:13.280 --> 26:18.800]  including those about 9-11 as such we have removed this post so all it was
[26:18.800 --> 26:22.760]  left with a 65 comments that had already come in from people in response to it
[26:22.760 --> 26:28.000]  and you know again it really stunned me and made me think wow the Huffington
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.880]  Post I mean I admire Ariana Huffington and and generally what they do with
[26:32.880 --> 26:37.000]  this and even the you know this internet blog is suddenly who's talking to
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.960]  these people if this order coming down from on high or what's really going on
[26:41.960 --> 26:48.760]  so Mark Crispin Miller put out the piece and and you know got into the fact is
[26:48.760 --> 26:52.560]  what what had happened and and I but I was really shocked by it and it just makes
[26:52.560 --> 26:57.040]  you wonder what how far does all this go I mean you got the mainstream media which
[26:57.040 --> 27:00.600]  won't even cover any of this stuff certainly will not review the book and
[27:00.600 --> 27:04.560]  then this happens on the Huffington Post I mean what do you think well there are
[27:04.560 --> 27:10.920]  peer-reviewed as you know Dick journals of scientists of physicists going over
[27:10.920 --> 27:15.520]  building sevens collapse NISS has had to admit after years of denying it it was
[27:15.520 --> 27:20.280]  freefall they say thermal expansion they don't know why this happened no other
[27:20.280 --> 27:24.800]  steel buildings ever did this you have a thousand architects and engineers in an
[27:24.800 --> 27:30.840]  international web telecasts meeting to put on their evidence you have depending
[27:30.840 --> 27:34.160]  on how you look at the number two or number three guy in the Japanese
[27:34.160 --> 27:38.560]  government right under the president of the diet who we've had on before being
[27:38.560 --> 27:42.800]  demonized in the Washington Post right you have former German defense minister
[27:42.800 --> 27:49.040]  Andres von Bülow saying clearly this was a staged event and you have all these
[27:49.040 --> 27:53.440]  questions they can't just come out and say that oh it's a conspiracy theory
[27:53.440 --> 28:00.320]  where depending on the poll 36 to 84 percent in scientific polls it varies
[28:00.320 --> 28:04.480]  widely don't believe the official story and you have six of the 10 911
[28:04.480 --> 28:08.600]  commissioners saying that there was a lot of deception and cover-up that was
[28:08.600 --> 28:13.320]  going on well yeah the 911 Commission I think has been shown even in a recent
[28:13.320 --> 28:17.280]  book by this guy farmer who was part of it that you know there's a huge cover-up
[28:17.280 --> 28:20.760]  on the level of the Warren Commission if not worse and you know they that they
[28:20.760 --> 28:24.520]  would only examine the evidence that led to the conclusion that they had already
[28:24.520 --> 28:29.600]  preconceived and that the the Bush administration had appointed the Zell
[28:29.600 --> 28:34.600]  account or to run it who was was you know one of their people I mean you know
[28:34.600 --> 28:40.720]  what's going on I mean you can if you if you think about it to say that the 911
[28:40.720 --> 28:46.120]  attacks were done by bin Laden and these are these 19 members of Al Qaeda isn't
[28:46.120 --> 28:49.080]  that a conspiracy theory I mean we weren't Bush and Cheney putting out a
[28:49.080 --> 28:54.280]  conspiracy theory really I mean it just makes no sense to me that that the
[28:54.280 --> 28:59.480]  having a poster would react this way I have never in eight years of 911 truth
[28:59.480 --> 29:05.080]  seen the media demonizing 911 truth spending more time on 911 truth like
[29:05.080 --> 29:09.360]  they are now to the point that I said in the last three months I believe they're
[29:09.360 --> 29:13.080]  gonna stage attacks on government buildings that's in Northwood's fake
[29:13.080 --> 29:18.040]  shootings and try to demonize 911 truth because they kept saying 911 truth is
[29:18.040 --> 29:22.320]  violent and we'd never been violent and I saw them getting the public ready for
[29:22.320 --> 29:26.680]  it and so wallah it happens but when we come back I want to ask you dick Russell
[29:26.680 --> 29:32.240]  why is the system so scared of 911 truth and asking questions generally then I
[29:32.240 --> 29:35.320]  want to walk through some of the chapters in the book and ask you what you
[29:35.320 --> 29:39.760]  think the best chapters are the most informative or the most well documented
[29:39.760 --> 29:43.840]  chapters are in the book he is the co-author of two books with Jesse
[29:43.840 --> 29:49.520]  Ventura and his latest is American conspiracies he's dick Russell joining
[29:49.520 --> 29:56.320]  us now long we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[29:56.320 --> 30:03.520]  GCN radio network hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are
[30:03.520 --> 30:07.640]  now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did
[30:07.640 --> 30:10.760]  you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[30:10.760 --> 30:14.400]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold and
[30:14.400 --> 30:18.240]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[30:18.240 --> 30:21.840]  our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[30:21.840 --> 30:27.300]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless
[30:27.300 --> 30:31.360]  supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best part
[30:31.360 --> 30:35.360]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get
[30:35.360 --> 30:39.440]  enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at
[30:39.440 --> 30:44.160]  survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give them a
[30:44.160 --> 30:55.320]  call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid
[30:55.320 --> 30:59.280]  seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survival seed bank
[30:59.280 --> 31:06.120]  dot com hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[31:06.120 --> 31:10.800]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[31:10.800 --> 31:15.040]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[31:15.040 --> 31:19.800]  I've turned numerous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[31:19.800 --> 31:24.600]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[31:24.600 --> 31:28.960]  citizens to pay attention full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[31:28.960 --> 31:34.200]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[31:34.200 --> 31:38.520]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[31:38.520 --> 31:42.000]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[31:42.000 --> 31:47.240]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[32:03.440 --> 32:07.880]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[32:07.880 --> 32:11.920]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[32:11.920 --> 32:15.800]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[32:15.800 --> 32:19.840]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[32:19.840 --> 32:24.400]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[32:24.400 --> 32:28.440]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[32:28.440 --> 32:32.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[32:32.240 --> 32:35.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[32:35.840 --> 32:40.200]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[32:40.200 --> 32:43.360]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[32:43.360 --> 32:47.000]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[33:36.760 --> 33:42.680]  the other evening demonizing 9-11 truth and they said 9-11 truthers claim that
[33:42.680 --> 33:47.680]  the 9-11 Commission says that there were questions but that's not true and they
[33:47.680 --> 33:53.600]  cut to Lee Hamilton saying no it's quite conclusive everything total lie six of
[33:53.600 --> 33:58.400]  the 10 are in newspapers of written books farmer one of the head lawyers says
[33:58.400 --> 34:02.680]  it was all a fraud the Pentagon was quote in a criminal cover-up that there
[34:02.680 --> 34:06.520]  should be criminal investigations that's in the Washington Post but nightline
[34:06.520 --> 34:12.480]  thinks you're so stupid that they sit there and deceive you and then they
[34:12.480 --> 34:17.200]  showed a clip from American conspiracies author Jesse Ventura on
[34:17.200 --> 34:25.880]  conspiracy theory his TV show number one on cable above all the major news shows
[34:25.880 --> 34:31.520]  on all the other cable shows except for Fox number one news show on true TV
[34:31.520 --> 34:35.880]  number one above all the networks except for Fox a really number two overall but
[34:35.880 --> 34:39.760]  number one for a new show out of the gates and maybe Ventura will have news
[34:39.760 --> 34:43.280]  for us on the TV show whether it's been picked up I mean I know but I'm not
[34:43.280 --> 34:48.840]  gonna say he probably won't say so we'll just leave it till we'll leave the good
[34:48.840 --> 34:54.480]  news or the bad news whatever the news is for the future but but that's why the
[34:54.480 --> 34:58.160]  system is losing so much credibility because of many Americans have read 9
[34:58.160 --> 35:03.480]  11 Commissioners saying there was a cover-up there were lies dick I mean
[35:03.480 --> 35:06.240]  doesn't the system understand what they're doing to themselves with this
[35:06.240 --> 35:11.560]  type of continued deceit and in the piece they demonized Ventura saying these
[35:11.560 --> 35:15.840]  conspiracy theories are getting so popular even Jesse Ventura is doing
[35:15.840 --> 35:24.400]  it well you know yes sir yes it doesn't surprise me I mean you got a figure
[35:24.400 --> 35:32.480]  that that you know that me my phone is seems to be losing its juice here but
[35:32.480 --> 35:39.840]  I can use yeah I can hear you dick do you have a landline you can pick up let me
[35:39.840 --> 35:49.760]  this is the only landline I've got Alex if you call me back in in let's see what
[35:49.760 --> 35:53.440]  should we do I'm gonna put you on hold and let you handle with my producers
[35:53.440 --> 35:58.080]  okay thank you that's why when I get set up to be a guest on coast to coast to
[35:58.080 --> 36:01.600]  him or something even though I've been going on for five years six years they
[36:01.600 --> 36:09.640]  will say you're on a landline correct and you're on a not a not a cordless
[36:09.640 --> 36:13.640]  because number one cordlesses don't have as good audio and they run out on you on
[36:13.640 --> 36:19.000]  air so that's a 101 that we asked guest and then we will avert many of these
[36:19.000 --> 36:26.840]  problems but regardless it's technology and this is just what goes on seems like
[36:26.840 --> 36:32.440]  phone quality and electronics quality just keeps going down and down and down
[36:32.440 --> 36:41.400]  as a society let me go ahead since we're doing this now and shift gears into
[36:41.400 --> 36:47.320]  some other subjects Jesse Ventura again will be joining us for a full hour off a
[36:47.320 --> 37:00.200]  hard line from his home in Minnesota on Friday okay continuing it's not just the
[37:00.200 --> 37:07.640]  censorship of Jesse Ventura's article it's not just the calls for internet
[37:07.640 --> 37:12.400]  censorship it's just not the distributed denial of service attack that we were
[37:12.400 --> 37:20.720]  under yesterday and continuing into today there is an attempt as Cass Sunstein
[37:20.720 --> 37:25.600]  at the White House says to restrict free speech period and that's because the
[37:25.600 --> 37:30.120]  system now admits that quote conspiracy theories are taking over it's not
[37:30.120 --> 37:34.120]  conspiracy theories it's a loss of confidence in the system from lies about
[37:34.120 --> 37:40.200]  WMD's and lies about banker bailouts and stolen elections and the CIA crashing
[37:40.200 --> 37:45.600]  airplanes full of pure cocaine in Mexico the people know the truth we've got
[37:45.600 --> 37:49.760]  Dick Russell back dick you you heard the point I was making before your phone
[37:49.760 --> 37:56.200]  cut out about again the system really seems to be panicking right now well
[37:56.200 --> 38:01.200]  yeah I mean there's good reason for it I mean people are finally starting to
[38:01.200 --> 38:06.000]  wake up and realize that indeed if the Bush administration would take us under
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.240]  false pretenses into the war in Iraq obviously in 2000 the Supreme Court
[38:11.240 --> 38:15.200]  handed them the election and there was a lot more going on than that a lot of
[38:15.200 --> 38:20.000]  questions being raised about September 11th and whether at the very least I
[38:20.000 --> 38:24.320]  mean all all the warnings at least we know that publicly that the mainstream
[38:24.320 --> 38:28.240]  media couldn't avoid that that the the there were so many warnings coming in
[38:28.240 --> 38:32.080]  that something was going to happen that were completely ignored by the Bush
[38:32.080 --> 38:37.240]  people whether they then orchestrated it of course that's a taboo question but
[38:37.240 --> 38:40.320]  very much an open question in my mind but the fact is that most of the
[38:40.320 --> 38:44.560]  corporate media will not look at these things just as they've never looked at
[38:44.560 --> 38:48.520]  the earlier assassinations and whether there were more than Oswald and Sir
[38:48.520 --> 38:52.760]  Hahn and James Earl Ray and involved and and that's what the course we're
[38:52.760 --> 38:56.400]  trying to do in American conspiracies is bring these things more into the light
[38:56.400 --> 39:00.600]  and at least have people thinking about it and raising questions that you're
[39:00.600 --> 39:05.760]  just not going to see done in the mainstream media so where do you see
[39:05.760 --> 39:09.440]  this going as more and more of the public discover they've been lied to and
[39:09.440 --> 39:13.480]  the establishment media and government and corporate line is you're a
[39:13.480 --> 39:17.720]  conspiracy theorist well I think things are getting are getting more and more
[39:17.720 --> 39:22.200]  polarized I mean people really should be calling for new investigations into
[39:22.200 --> 39:26.600]  what happened I'm not saying that there's going to be a legitimate response
[39:26.600 --> 39:32.440]  to this but if enough people do it and you know are ready to take to the well
[39:32.440 --> 39:37.840]  I would say take to the streets you know for for some kind of real action and to
[39:37.840 --> 39:41.200]  get the truth out about what's what what we've been told and also you know in
[39:41.200 --> 39:45.040]  terms of getting out there and pushing that for the health care reform for
[39:45.040 --> 39:47.720]  doing something about global warming all these things I believe should be
[39:47.720 --> 39:52.360]  getting much more of a citizen response and right now I guess we're just all
[39:52.360 --> 39:57.080]  many of us are too comfortable to do it but I think people's eyes are being
[39:57.080 --> 40:01.280]  opened and you know it's going to get interesting in the next few years we'll
[40:01.280 --> 40:06.200]  see dick separately you know Jesse did an investigation of supposed man-made
[40:06.200 --> 40:09.840]  global warming and he believed in it as well like you just said you do and
[40:09.840 --> 40:15.360]  that's fine you're welcome to your your research in your opinion but then he did
[40:15.360 --> 40:19.560]  find a massive evidence of them cooking the books in climate Gator you
[40:19.560 --> 40:24.480]  concerned about that well here's what I'm concerned about I you know I'm more
[40:24.480 --> 40:28.200]  much more concerned about the the fact that a lot of these big oil and coal
[40:28.200 --> 40:33.000]  companies have bought and paid scientific experts you know who are
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.760]  coming out and claiming that that the very strong evidence that the
[40:36.760 --> 40:41.040]  international panel for climate change and others that have come to that that
[40:41.040 --> 40:45.240]  it's very real but they bought these guys they're they're hired guns and to me
[40:45.240 --> 40:48.960]  that's a much bigger conspiracy I mean you know I don't believe in cap and
[40:48.960 --> 40:53.480]  trade legislation or solution is going to is going to make that much of a
[40:53.480 --> 40:57.720]  difference and yes I've read and certainly companies like Goldman Sachs
[40:57.720 --> 41:01.160]  are planning to make a killing off this and I'm I'm opposed to that I don't
[41:01.160 --> 41:06.240]  think it's a real solution but you know it is it is a very real situation and
[41:06.240 --> 41:11.280]  something that we got to be the hip to and looking to do something about dick
[41:11.280 --> 41:14.760]  Russell co-author with Jesse Ventura of don't start the revolution without me
[41:14.760 --> 41:19.240]  a New York Times bestseller and already a bestseller only officially out since
[41:19.240 --> 41:27.120]  Monday so we're three days in American conspiracy dick bottom line we do have
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.440]  serious environmental crises from my research like genetic engineering open
[41:31.440 --> 41:35.400]  air planning of these pharmacological crops but I see nothing being done about
[41:35.400 --> 41:41.760]  that instead a called a tax carbon dioxide that plants breathe but expanding
[41:41.760 --> 41:46.680]  on the book there's so many alternate views of history so much evidence of
[41:46.680 --> 41:55.520]  government lies in a many of the pillars of historical development how did you
[41:55.520 --> 42:01.000]  guys pick the 14 chapters that you wrote about in the book well I think they
[42:01.000 --> 42:07.440]  were the most clear examples of cover-up and of major events that have changed
[42:07.440 --> 42:12.080]  the course of our American history and you know what we could have looked at
[42:12.080 --> 42:15.400]  other things we could have taken on maybe UFOs or you know I'm not saying that
[42:15.400 --> 42:19.040]  there's there are not other important subjects to be looked at but these
[42:19.040 --> 42:23.800]  things like the ones that that really make a huge difference in all our lives
[42:23.800 --> 42:28.560]  and for example the stolen elections of recent years that that allowed the
[42:28.560 --> 42:34.240]  Bush administration to turn and from my research it doesn't matter whether you
[42:34.240 --> 42:37.840]  see yourself as a conservative or a liberal if an election is stolen it's
[42:37.840 --> 42:43.720]  stolen and there's no doubt the 2000 and 2004 elections were rigged let's talk
[42:43.720 --> 42:48.600]  about that chapter in the book yeah I think that chapter has some of the new
[42:48.600 --> 42:52.840]  evidence that's really going to be compelling to people you know I'll tell
[42:52.840 --> 42:57.760]  you a personal story I I ran into John Kerry of course he ran for president in
[42:57.760 --> 43:03.520]  2004 at a fundraiser thing in Boston and I talked to him for a little bit and I
[43:03.520 --> 43:07.480]  asked him if he was aware because I had done a piece with Bobby Kennedy Jr. in
[43:07.480 --> 43:11.920]  Enrolling Stone about about the electronic voting machine and the
[43:11.920 --> 43:16.440]  theft of the election and he said I know I won the election but by the time my
[43:16.440 --> 43:20.360]  lawyers he went on could come up with a smoking gun in Ohio it was too late so
[43:20.360 --> 43:25.520]  you know my thought after that was well if Kerry knows this and how come he's
[43:25.520 --> 43:28.960]  never spoken out publicly about it I mean wouldn't this be something that you
[43:28.960 --> 43:34.040]  at least want the American people to know in my research into this and working
[43:34.040 --> 43:39.040]  with with Governor Ventura on it we came across this this really interesting
[43:39.040 --> 43:44.080]  story of a guy named Michael Connell who was the IT guy the computer guy the
[43:44.080 --> 43:51.280]  expert for Carl Rowe for some years and strong evidence and I interviewed
[43:51.280 --> 43:55.360]  several people about this and there's a lawsuit in Ohio that brought him
[43:55.360 --> 44:02.000]  into it as well that he was directly involved in rigging the 2004 election in
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.240]  Ohio with which of course decided the election and then you had Secretary of
[44:06.240 --> 44:09.880]  State Blackwell who was very much involved with the Bush people and in doing
[44:09.880 --> 44:13.280]  this and that they had this I'm not going to get into all the details of
[44:13.280 --> 44:17.480]  computer you know what they call a man in the middle plan but they had this
[44:17.480 --> 44:21.840]  whole system set up where they could they could send the votes from the various
[44:21.840 --> 44:27.040]  Ohio precincts or districts to a voting machine out in Chattanooga, Tennessee
[44:27.040 --> 44:32.080]  run by another operative they kind of apparently been then sending this on to
[44:32.080 --> 44:35.920]  even to the war room in the White House but they were changing votes that night
[44:35.920 --> 44:40.760]  and changing them in such a way that Bush was going to win Ohio at least to
[44:40.760 --> 44:45.280]  technically speaking and this guy Connell continued to work for the
[44:45.280 --> 44:52.800]  Republican Party and as late as 2008 not too long before the election he was
[44:52.800 --> 44:58.040]  called before this called into court to give a deposition in this case that
[44:58.040 --> 45:03.960]  had been brought by some people in Ohio about what had happened there and he
[45:03.960 --> 45:09.720]  was stonewalling to some degree but apparently ready to talk and there's
[45:09.720 --> 45:14.880]  pretty strong indications that Carl Rowe who was saying a week before the 2008
[45:14.880 --> 45:20.800]  election but McCain still pulled this out that when when Connell was called in
[45:20.800 --> 45:26.280]  to give a deposition the day before the election that they decided hey wait a
[45:26.280 --> 45:30.080]  minute you know we can't go forward with this plus Obama's probably got too big
[45:30.080 --> 45:34.560]  a lead if we if we try to steal this one too with Connell and others the
[45:34.560 --> 45:38.120]  nickname of the computers we're going to be found out it's a suddenly the night
[45:38.120 --> 45:42.880]  before Rowe wrote a column indicating saying that no Obama's gonna win by a
[45:42.880 --> 45:47.080]  relative landslide so there was a there was a possibility they were going to
[45:47.080 --> 45:51.600]  try to steal that election too and then what happens to Mike Connell about a
[45:51.600 --> 45:54.880]  month later and he's flying back in his private plane from Washington DC to
[45:54.880 --> 45:58.840]  Ohio where he lived and the plane goes down under various suspicious
[45:58.840 --> 46:04.120]  circumstances and Connell is killed so rack that up with another mysterious
[46:04.120 --> 46:08.640]  death in this whole process of which there have been many you know dating
[46:08.640 --> 46:13.520]  back to the Kennedy assassination certainly absolutely let's get into some
[46:13.520 --> 46:18.360]  of the other sections your government is dealing drugs that's a bold statement
[46:18.360 --> 46:24.560]  but it's it's absolutely part of historical fact even the 1996 CIA
[46:24.560 --> 46:29.080]  inspector general testified to Congress that was the case and the crack cocaine
[46:29.080 --> 46:34.720]  epidemic of the 1980s but let's get into that chapter a little bit here yeah
[46:34.720 --> 46:39.040]  well it really goes back you know to the to the formation of the CIA and and
[46:39.040 --> 46:43.280]  bringing heroin out of Southeast Asia to fund a lot of their
[46:43.280 --> 46:47.440]  activities working with the big mafia drug lords like Lucky Luciano back during
[46:47.440 --> 46:51.320]  World War two when they were still the OSS then of course during Vietnam there
[46:51.320 --> 46:55.560]  was this whole Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia where again a lot of money
[46:55.560 --> 47:01.240]  for covert operations was being you know funneled through and also making
[47:01.240 --> 47:05.680]  some private fortunes for for some of the agency people places like the Nugent
[47:05.680 --> 47:09.800]  Hand Bank for example my people might remember that they were channeling funds
[47:09.800 --> 47:14.200]  through that bank for covert ops all drug money and then the Iran Contra
[47:14.200 --> 47:19.280]  years it's a public record that although they didn't want to get into it too much
[47:19.280 --> 47:22.560]  in those Iran Contra hearings which by the way Lee Hamilton was one of the
[47:22.560 --> 47:27.440]  chairs of the guy who ended up chairing the 9-11 Commission Iran Contra
[47:27.440 --> 47:31.840]  fair was was very much involved with the Contras you know being funneled or
[47:31.840 --> 47:36.880]  being funded by by drug money that the Oliver North and others were helping
[47:36.880 --> 47:40.320]  race for them so you know I mean this has been going on a long time and Gary
[47:40.320 --> 47:44.880]  Webb people may remember him he's the journalist who broke the story in the
[47:44.880 --> 47:52.120]  San Jose Mercury news about the the the crack CIA connection and he had a new
[47:52.120 --> 47:55.440]  book coming out of the vindicating everything he previously said so they
[47:55.440 --> 48:00.160]  shotgun him twice in the head and the local police said it was suicide that's
[48:00.160 --> 48:05.400]  right well Gary Webb was found dead and I don't know the details of it but but
[48:05.400 --> 48:09.960]  yeah it was it was allegedly suicide and of course he was before that the media
[48:09.960 --> 48:13.320]  just destroyed him you know it came out and did this whole series of articles
[48:13.320 --> 48:17.280]  that that he was supposedly blowing smoke and you know the fact is that he'd
[48:17.280 --> 48:21.040]  come out with something that was absolutely right on that the drug
[48:21.040 --> 48:26.400]  gangs and in LA were very involved with the with the CIA with this and you know
[48:26.400 --> 48:31.600]  then you had the whole BCCI the Bank of Crooks and Criminals really scandal in
[48:31.600 --> 48:35.040]  the in a little bit later and right up to today where where you've got a
[48:35.040 --> 48:41.560]  situation where in Afghanistan biggest you know opium growing area in the
[48:41.560 --> 48:47.040]  world for heroin coming into this country Pakistani intelligence service
[48:47.040 --> 48:50.920]  being very involved along with the president's brother in Afghanistan with
[48:50.920 --> 48:56.400]  the drug trade and of course Mexico where you know we're supposedly fighting
[48:56.400 --> 49:00.680]  this this war on drugs but the fact fact is that you know how many people have
[49:00.680 --> 49:06.280]  been killed between December 2006 and the spring of 2009 more than 10,000 people
[49:06.280 --> 49:11.880]  were killed in those drug wars in Mexico and you know they I mean this and this
[49:11.880 --> 49:16.080]  is all about again a lot of people look in the other way while fighting over the
[49:16.080 --> 49:20.080]  turf I mean you've got and that's what's so incredible about this book I mean I
[49:20.080 --> 49:25.200]  study this stuff constantly and I find most books you know boring or not
[49:25.200 --> 49:31.120]  accurate information this is really gold information this is blue chip writing
[49:31.120 --> 49:36.320]  that we're talking about here and and it's it's again so bold I mean you're
[49:36.320 --> 49:40.000]  learning about how they kill a lot of people that prominently oppose them I
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.560]  would imagine you've gotten the willies a few times or you know the chills have
[49:45.560 --> 49:48.400]  you ever gotten spooked dick knowing you were writing this book and it was
[49:48.400 --> 49:51.880]  coming out because you get into the Wall Street conspiracy ripping everybody
[49:51.880 --> 49:57.160]  off by design you get into the secret plan to destroy democracy freedom here
[49:57.160 --> 50:00.400]  in the United States with the shadow government and continuity of government
[50:00.400 --> 50:07.400]  I mean this book covers it all well yeah and yes it's I wouldn't say it makes me
[50:07.400 --> 50:12.280]  rest easy to put it out there but you know I feel that the truth is
[50:12.280 --> 50:16.600]  important and the truth is based on a lot of facts that are out there that
[50:16.600 --> 50:21.040]  somebody needed to put together and and you know I back I wrote two books on
[50:21.040 --> 50:24.640]  the Kennedy assassination and spend a number of years researching that and
[50:24.640 --> 50:28.840]  and back in those days in the 1970s especially yeah I know I was swallowed
[50:28.840 --> 50:33.520]  by by the CIA and and other people and you know I'm not a paranoid type of
[50:33.520 --> 50:37.320]  person but this is what happened you know I should have talked more about you
[50:37.320 --> 50:41.440]  today while you were with us I mean yeah you're one of the most well researched

[54:10.040 --> 54:14.480]  we've got to get dick Russell on separately for a full hour sometime just
[54:14.480 --> 54:18.360]  on his JFK investigation because if they're lying about 9-11 lying about
[54:18.360 --> 54:23.080]  JFK lying about government drug dealing what else are they not lying about
[54:23.080 --> 54:26.960]  another line about basically everything I mean it's come out government
[54:26.960 --> 54:31.920]  documents that I've had the army watching me Ron Paul that they go to our
[54:31.920 --> 54:36.720]  events and spy on us that homeland security spying on even little churches
[54:36.720 --> 54:43.680]  mainline groups co-intel pro that came out in the 70s all of this is going on
[54:43.680 --> 54:49.200]  today and finish up talking about some of the things that happened to you when
[54:49.200 --> 54:56.560]  you were writing treatises on JFK well I had a guy named Richard Nagel who was
[54:56.560 --> 55:02.280]  a CIA had been a CIA contract agent and and also worked for the Russians and he
[55:02.280 --> 55:06.320]  was one of my main sources and never told me everything he knew but told me
[55:06.320 --> 55:10.520]  enough and oh I got it's a long story but I get we can talk about it some other
[55:10.520 --> 55:16.000]  time on the air but well toward the end of 1995 anyway he was found dead the
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.760]  very day that a subpoena from the assassination records review board
[55:18.760 --> 55:23.080]  appeared in his mailbox and and that shook me up a great deal because I had
[55:23.080 --> 55:26.920]  just given us a talk the week before that the review board had listened to
[55:26.920 --> 55:30.040]  and then decided to subpoena him and all his records and interview him and
[55:30.040 --> 55:35.280]  suddenly he's he's no longer with us and so now obviously things like that
[55:35.280 --> 55:43.440]  happening give one pause absolutely in fact we forget well what was it 78 that
[55:43.440 --> 55:49.040]  Congress found a probable conspiracy they said 98% didn't they well yeah they
[55:49.040 --> 55:52.560]  came out with an official published report that there was a probable
[55:52.560 --> 55:56.160]  conspiracy to the assassinate president Kennedy directly contradicting the war
[55:56.160 --> 56:00.560]  and Commission oh you wouldn't know that today because you know Bibliosi comes
[56:00.560 --> 56:04.600]  out with his book big book saying the Warren Commission was right and that's
[56:04.600 --> 56:08.280]  the book that gets all the review attention along with the Posner's book
[56:08.280 --> 56:12.160]  conspiracy books quote-unquote don't even get reviewed by the mainstream media I
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.800]  don't think either of my books was ever given a big review so you know that's
[56:16.800 --> 56:21.440]  just the way it is and it has to happen by a by word of mouth really and people
[56:21.440 --> 56:24.720]  talk to their neighbors and saying hey you you want to know the truth about
[56:24.720 --> 56:29.320]  what happened to check this out yeah well you've certainly risked your life
[56:29.320 --> 56:34.920]  and I'm gonna ask Ventura a question Friday I've never asked him and I'm
[56:34.920 --> 56:39.280]  gonna ask you this now on record because I told the DC madam to do this on
[56:39.280 --> 56:43.360]  record on air and and she said on record I'll never commit suicide she told her
[56:43.360 --> 56:48.480]  landlord I'm being tracked they may try to kill me they did let me let's get it
[56:48.480 --> 56:52.760]  on record dick you're never planning to commit suicide no I'm not that's
[56:52.760 --> 56:57.240]  absolutely right I'm never planning to commit suicide and so if they find you
[56:57.240 --> 57:02.480]  with a God forbid a empty bottle of sleeping pills or I mean that was they
[57:02.480 --> 57:09.440]  killed you I would say that's true hopefully that will happen well you you
[57:09.440 --> 57:14.480]  know reading some of the people originally involved in the JFK criminal
[57:14.480 --> 57:18.520]  investigation down in Louisiana Garrison and others they did make the point it's
[57:18.520 --> 57:23.600]  important on record to stay public to stay visible and to tell people I'm not
[57:23.600 --> 57:30.560]  planning to kill myself and I want to say that today about Alex Jones because you
[57:30.560 --> 57:34.120]  know it seems like 30 years ago they did pretty much kill everybody that
[57:34.120 --> 57:37.520]  criticized them now they don't kill as many people I think because they realize
[57:37.520 --> 57:42.520]  that whack-a-mole technique isn't working anymore dick well that could be
[57:42.520 --> 57:45.760]  and they certainly is 30 years ago they killed David Ferry in the Garrison
[57:45.760 --> 57:50.560]  investigation in George DeMoran shield as opposed to suicide and in when the
[57:50.560 --> 57:54.040]  House Committee was just about to interview him and he'd been Oswald's
[57:54.040 --> 57:59.760]  buddy and handler I interviewed DeMoran shield a couple of times and at one
[57:59.760 --> 58:03.640]  point I remember his wife calling it screaming out well we first we know it
[58:03.640 --> 58:07.960]  was a vast conspiracy they didn't ever elaborate however and he was never
[58:07.960 --> 58:12.360]  allowed to we're about to go to break into five more minutes with you but
[58:12.360 --> 58:16.640]  separately we actually first had the audio tape and aired it here Rolling

[58:20.280 --> 58:25.880]  confession you know I don't really know what to make of it exactly because
[58:25.880 --> 58:31.040]  Howard Hunt is somebody that I never put a lot of stock in whether he was gonna
[58:31.040 --> 58:34.960]  be telling the truth or writing another fiction novel which he wrote many and
[58:34.960 --> 58:38.120]  he worked with the CIA for a lot of years and certainly involved in the
[58:38.120 --> 58:42.120]  watergate stay there got a break got a break

[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:53.080]  next few months but separately here real quick a few of the other chapters the
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:58.520]  walls street conspiracy and chapter 13 and chapter 14 the secret plans to end
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:03.520]  American democracy yeah well you know what we'll start with the Wall Street one
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:08.560]  I mean that was really doing research into just what happened a little over a
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:13.440]  year ago and when the big bailout went down and and how come Goldman Sachs and
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:19.120]  AIG got away with murder basically and it looks that back things like AIG's ties
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:24.840]  to the CIA going way back into the you know into the 1940s and and beyond and
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:31.560]  and and Goldman Sachs very mysterious stuff too the secret plans to destroy
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:36.040]  American democracy you know it's there for people to to put the pieces together
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:40.400]  which is what Governor Ventura and I tried to do with this chapter it's
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.680]  been to certain things that went on the books during the Bush years especially
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:50.880]  the continuity of government plans for martial law something called end game
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:57.120]  which you know again as part of the homeland security of but I love these
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.960]  code names you know Bible response and X caliber and I wonder you know who's
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.520]  making this stuff up and in the game into the Republic because that's what it
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:12.440]  spells out in an incredible book briefly the Malcolm X chapter amazing or the
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:20.840]  the conspiracy by the CIA against Nixon yeah well the conspiracy by the CIA
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:26.080]  against Nixon was with a fascinating thing to look at because so many of the
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.480]  players in the Kennedy assassination come up again in the Watergate day and
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.680]  Nixon of course talking about quote the whole day of pig thing in all of those
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:40.320]  tapes putting the smoking gun tape that's really an acronym according to
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.720]  Haldeman his chief of staff for the Kennedy assassination and Nixon wanted
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:48.000]  to know what does the CIA know about the assassination now why you want to know
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.640]  that was it because he had some involvement in it and he wanted to know
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.720]  what they had on him or was it because he wanted to have the goods on the CIA I
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.240]  don't know the answer to that but we know he was in Dallas and it looks like
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.680]  his fingerprints were on it but go ahead well yeah I mean he was there for a
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.320]  Pepsi Cola bottlers convention and before that he worked on those CIA mafia
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.800]  plots to get rid of Castro and when he was in the Eisenhower administration so
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.560]  how much Nick when did Nixon know what a Nixon when did he know it is very much a
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:19.440]  an open question but I laid out the evidence in that chapter as to how all
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:24.320]  of this seems to tie back a lot of it anyway to September November 22nd 1963
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.920]  and and Nixon's attempt to get at the CIA records are missing the CIA then going

[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:31.400]  all right we got 52 minutes left and G Edward Griffin is our guest yet we're
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.880]  going to say writer a documentary film producer for 45 years been exposing the
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.600]  hidden agenda now that's out in the open of the world government well known
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.720]  because of his talent for researching difficult topics and presenting them in
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.720]  clear terms that all can understand with many successful titles to his
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.920]  credit he has dealt with such diverse subjects as archaeology the Federal
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:57.680]  Reserve System and international banking terrorism internal subversion US foreign
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:01.960]  policy the Supreme Court and the United Nations is better known works include
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:06.720]  the creature from jackall island moles in high places the open gates of Troy no
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:12.160]  place to hide the capitalist conspiracy more deadly than war perhaps we'll talk
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:17.200]  about the capitalist conspiracy today and explain why we always see big bankers
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:23.120]  and in an oligarchs and industrialist behind communist movements and why
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:27.200]  they're pushing for government-run healthcare and big government and the
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:33.960]  green tax takeover today but G Edward we started getting into conspiracies when
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:39.440]  three guys decided rob a bank that's a conspiracy and when somebody conspires to
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:46.760]  murder their spouse it's a conspiracy if I I mean people conspire in a
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:54.280]  non-criminal way to open a sandwich shop I mean it's it's it's insane for the
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:57.920]  government the media to say all these other countries and people are involved
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:02.480]  in conspiracies but our government it's never involved powerful people don't get
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.600]  behind closed doors to try to expand their power well yeah it's the anybody
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:12.640]  that scoffs at the concept of conspiracy today I kind of feel sorry for them
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:16.280]  because I know that their brains have been captured captured in some way by
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.680]  the propaganda and it also tells me that they have never read a history book
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:25.640]  because you know any cursory glance at history produces the realization that
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.080]  history is driven by the action of conspiracy I don't think there's a
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:34.840]  single major event in history that wasn't centered around good dozens if not
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:41.160]  hundreds of conspiracies large and small it's the it's the nature of man it's
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:46.520]  certainly the nature of man when he's in a position to acquire great wealth or
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:51.320]  power through conspiracies and of course at the apex of that little chart of how
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:56.820]  you can gain control of great wealth and power it is the government and so we
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:00.960]  find most of the big conspiracies of history centered in government so people
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.560]  say well yeah you can find sick you know conspiracies in industry conspiracies
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:09.840]  in you know advertising companies are always being taken to court for
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:13.400]  conspiracy to defraud the public and so forth but they don't know not in
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.480]  government as you just mentioned well actually a government is the most
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:21.240]  likely place for a conspiracy to be found because tremendous the profit and the
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:26.000]  benefit pay off so anyway people who've got scoffed conspiracy I understand them
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.960]  I I just have to laugh internally thinking well these people have a little
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:34.080]  more to learn but in time they will learn it and they'll be saying somewhere
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.080]  down the line that well I've been telling you all along that these other
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:42.360]  conspiracies out there you know but it's our job to educate and to present the
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.200]  facts so that people can come to that conclusion themselves not because we
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.880]  said so not because we labeled it a conspiracy but it's labeled out the
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:54.680]  history of what happened who did it and documented and then they'll say by golly
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:12:00.680]  that's a conspiracy well G Edward I am I do a lot of interviews like you do to
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:06.600]  magazines newspapers I was on CBC radio yesterday and they said how did you come
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:11.480]  upon these views how did you become a conspiracy theorist and if it's the same
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:17.000]  answer you just gave my parents are big readers my mom was a history major in
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.760]  college and you know my dad's a physician and I learned early on that
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:26.880]  history books were more entertaining by the time I was about 12 and my son's
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.480]  now the same way at seven that's his favorite thing is his children's and
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:35.920]  and he's now even reading adult history books and and encyclopedias and things
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.680]  you know that hunger for knowledge any period any culture any empire that's
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:45.440]  all it is his conspiracies that's why these empires and Caesar and others
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.720]  always set up police states because there were always people conspiring in
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.600]  their own government to overthrow them so it's just asinine to say there aren't
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:59.760]  conspiracies afoot what are some of the more famous conspiracies that have been
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:07.160]  proven to be real well I guess the you know that to Brute we all know about the
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:12.600]  Roman conspiracy it's estimation that took place there there can go back I'm
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.640]  just I wasn't prepared for that question but it would be a fun thing to
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:21.680]  assemble I remember back in I think it was the 50s or maybe the 60s there was a
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:27.120]  lot of television coverage and news coverage to this to exposing the Mafia
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:32.360]  the Mafiosa and the coast of Nostra in the United States and around the world
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:37.120]  well that's a conspiracy everybody acknowledges that you know it doesn't
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.920]  take long if you really are looking for a conspiracy to study all you have to do
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:45.440]  is go down to your local courthouse and sit there and listen to cases for a day
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.760]  or two and you'll find out that I'm going to guess probably 10 15% of them
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.680]  involve conspiracies conspiracies are all over the place they're the norm
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:59.120]  families conspired to steal the inheritance away from the the primary
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:04.480]  inheritor but corporations conspired to defraud the public and pharmaceutical
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:09.800]  companies conspired to hide scientific evidence that shows that their drugs are
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:14.480]  killing people and you can just go there's no trouble finding conspiracy
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.760]  let's go back to the mafia that's the best example I've ever heard I hadn't
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.800]  thought of that here you have Jagger Hoover who was clearly being blackmailed
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:26.240]  by the mafia getting up in speeches and saying there's no such thing as La Cosa
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.080]  Nostra and then researching those cases is so interesting I probably read 15
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.680]  books or more and watch a lot of television programs like most people
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:41.160]  about it you had less than 30 mafia families in Italy in Greece in Western
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:46.960]  Europe and Eastern Europe and in North America controlling the opium trade the
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:53.960]  cocaine trade prostitution gambling olive oil importation I mean just in
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:15:00.480]  and these were just 30 families or less but then government and giant private
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:05.240]  corporations and and and US intelligence agencies with trillions of dollars of
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:10.320]  funding since the National Security Act of 47 operating in total secret doing
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:14.560]  whatever they want you mean powerful avarice filled people aren't gonna move
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.000]  into those positions even if it was founded good which it wasn't you mean
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.360]  they're not gonna move in and and and take power you mean there's not a blue
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:28.680]  blood Yale group on record that founded the CIA almost purely of skull and bones
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:34.160]  that's mainline you know New York Times to fully take over the mafia and then
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:39.120]  knock off the Italian mob yeah there's no question about this we're talking about
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.400]  history now this is not difficult to document that there's always been a a
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:49.640]  very close working relationship between the coast of Nostra the mafia and
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:54.400]  government so-called security agencies there's like there's some people that
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:59.120]  move back and forth some of the most fascinating information that's come out
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:04.240]  in my opinion regarding the Kennedy assassination is that there appears to be
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:10.960]  of was a very close operational a team put together partly involving the
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:17.640]  Chicago mob and partly involving government agencies primarily under the
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:22.520]  direction of CIA but not necessarily limited CIA but there was a merger there
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:26.600]  and these people work together it's oh they might you know compete once in a
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.040]  while sometimes they work together and then you come away from that you put the
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.720]  book down you put down the magazine or the newspaper whatever source and you
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.440]  stare into space and all of a sudden you say oh my gosh I see now why they work
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:43.720]  together they have the same mentality these are the people that have created
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:48.240]  a crime syndicate inside our government our government has been taken over by a
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:53.200]  crime syndicate once you once that hits you I mean it's really a blow for a guy
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:58.520]  like me I was raised you know a very patriotic kid I thought America was you
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:01.640]  know the land of the free of the home of the brave and I heard all of this and I
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:06.280]  know that it was one time but I never realized that through most of my younger
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:11.400]  years that the America I knew and the America I had revered was gradually
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:16.520]  being stolen by this organized syndicate this crime syndicate so anyway
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:22.240]  that's a harsh reality and I don't expect many people to to say ah yeah he's
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.360]  got it they'll probably think this guy's crazy but I guarantee you once you start
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.080]  reading some of those history books and really looking behind the scenes you're
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:36.000]  gonna come to that conclusion well I have read no exaggeration more than a
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.960]  hundred books mainline history books on World War two and the declassified
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:46.640]  Nazi files of how Hitler got the power then what he did to secure power all he
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:51.200]  was doing was constantly trying to stop the communist conspiracy in the
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:56.200]  government he was constantly trying to stop the Freemason conspiracy he was
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:00.040]  even suspicious of Catholic groups because he didn't think he fully control
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:06.160]  them though some back team and it's all about him securing his power structure
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:11.440]  from the other mafias that were in the government well yeah the gangs often have
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:15.640]  to do that you know they're always worrying about each other they unite
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:20.400]  sometimes because the common enemy in a way is the public because they've got
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:24.520]  to fleece the public so they'll they'll you know sometimes cooperate on that but
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:27.240]  people out there fighting for turf I don't think it's much different than
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:33.360]  street gangs in a big city and yeah they often compete with each other amazing
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.920]  G Edward Griffin you know I've got a lot of questions to throw out a lot of
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.840]  different angles and places to go I want to come back and take a few calls
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.520]  just to mix it up a bit because we usually wait till the end for calls but
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:46.040]  then I want to talk about all the exciting things that are happening right
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:50.400]  now and the explosive growth curve of the awakening we're seeing and and where
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.760]  you see that going if we've got a minute or so start getting into it now if you
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:59.320]  can well yeah that probably would benefit from a little thought that what
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:03.760]  the heck let's just jump in and swim there's there's no doubt that there is
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:11.280]  a very rise in awakening regarding the public awakening of the fact that their
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:15.880]  own government has been taken over or heavily influenced by this criminal
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:19.680]  syndicate that I've been talking about they're beginning to realize that the
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.720]  politicians and the bureaucrats in Washington that we generally refer to
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:28.560]  as our government really consists of people and the people have loyalties
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.160]  that are not to the Constitution and not to the people of the United States they
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:37.880]  have loyalties to their inner group it boils he's to a concept of
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:42.600]  internationalism what they finally call the New World Order these people are
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:47.120]  running the show I mean there are teams supposedly and yet they're really
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:51.320]  playing for the other side and people are waking up to that you know the
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.000]  question is what are they gonna do about it all right stay there we're gonna come
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.920]  back and continue to discuss this with G. Edward Griffin we'll give you his

[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:09.120]  okay J. Albert Griffin you were talking about what are we going to do about it
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:13.680]  well look at Iceland they identified the banks as the enemy trying to make the
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:18.320]  public pay for debts that they didn't even owe that the banks had engineered
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:22.640]  in the Ponzi scheme I mean I think that's another prototype of what the
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:27.360]  rest of the world should do just to identify these people expose them
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.960]  expose their mafia syndicate I mean that's all the fellow reserve is for my
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.000]  research is a cartel and as you expose the creature from Jekyll Island your
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.120]  best-selling book they met in secret like the mafia to set it up well yeah
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:45.120]  that's one of the airmarks of the conspiracy we're back to that word
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:50.400]  again I don't think that these guys that created the Federal Reserve thought of
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:56.080]  themselves as conspirators they thought help themselves as being shrewd
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:01.320]  businessmen and in a sort of weird way being high-minded citizens you know they
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:05.720]  they really thought they were putting together a system that although it was
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:09.240]  to their benefit of course I always start with that it was going to be good
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:13.080]  for the country you know that they rationalize that I really it took me a
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:16.520]  while to come to that conclusion but that's what David Rockefeller says in
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:21.280]  a lot of internal minutes that have come out yes we bankers no best we'll we need
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.680]  to you genics is good we're we're going to take over for you you don't know what's
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:30.480]  best for you that's it exactly that's the collectivist mind and so they they
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:33.800]  really believe that stuff and it's clear when you read their their letters
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:37.560]  and their internal memos that they're they're convinced that so anyway they
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:40.000]  didn't think they were conspirators because they didn't think they were
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.080]  doing anything wrong and they certainly weren't doing anything illegal because
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:49.800]  they were drafting the law that would make this their plan quite legal that
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:53.440]  they were doing perhaps what we should be doing is the meeting and saying okay
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:57.960]  let's draft a piece of legislation that's gonna unravel some of the old
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:05.240]  legislation you mean commoners writing legislation well maybe not commoners I
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:08.320]  don't maybe we're common but I don't think we're too common I wish there were
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:13.600]  more of us and then we then I'd say yes commoners but no I think that brings up
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:19.040]  a really good point because there's a sort of a implied expectation among a
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:23.400]  lot of newly awakening people that well we've got to get 51% of the
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:27.440]  population on board before anything can happen because this is a democracy
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:32.000]  isn't it and the majority must rule and all of that and what the reality is that
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.040]  always throughout history and certainly throughout American history the country
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:40.880]  has been led by a very small people percentage wise way less than 3% of
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.080]  population have always led this country and that's true of every country in the
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:49.880]  world the others will just go along with that's why the conspirators are so
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:54.360]  scared of us because I'd say we conservatively have 15% that are now
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.680]  really hardcore awake and all the polls show that and 60 70% that are really
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:04.080]  upset and ready to be awakened well that's true but the rest of that formula
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:08.880]  is the is the catch it's not just the numbers yes well I would say we have
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:13.440]  15% or maybe more but it the other part of the equation is where are these
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.680]  people who are they what power do they have well our 15% doesn't hold enough
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:23.480]  power to match their 1% because the collectivists have burrowed into all
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:27.680]  the honeypots at parasites and they're up there greedily running everything and
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:32.120]  they see us waking up so they go higher SWAT teams build armored fortresses
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:38.960]  scan them control them they're waking up that we're sucking off of them no we're
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:44.880]  collectivists we're saving you from global warming I love that Alec I
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:53.240]  think I'm going into show business yeah it is fun but it's pretty accurate too
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:58.560]  amazingly so they probably don't sound hysterical but possibly inside their
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:05.360]  head they're thinking that way but yet that is it exactly our 15 or 20% and
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:10.520]  it's growing just can't match their 1% or half a percent because as you say
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.720]  they're in all the honeypots they're in what we call the power centers of
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:18.280]  society they control the the government they control the military they control
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:26.280]  the media you know so that gives that 1% a tremendous lever of power over the
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:30.840]  rest of the population so back to the question what do we do about it we have
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:35.880]  to become influential in those same honeypots we have to move into those
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:40.160]  areas of influence that's what we should be doing not just saying oh well my
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:43.320]  goodness that we ought to do this and write a good paper and all these the
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:46.280]  G Edward do you think they're and we'll talk more about solutions when we come
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:49.120]  back go to calls but clearly and they even say this is some of their white
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:52.760]  papers cast Sunset at the White House that because we're waking up because
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.160]  we're trying to take over the states peacefully because we are going with the
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.360]  long view of history that you and others have rightfully called for as
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:04.160]  historians they are now racing to the finish line and trying to put their
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:08.720]  control grid in to try to checkmate us before we build up enough of our
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:15.600]  initiative to defeat them that's it exactly and there's some debate as to
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.080]  whether or not they've already reached that point I don't think they have but
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:25.920]  I think they're very close to it I mean the two colors of sovereignty are
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:30.000]  monetary sovereignty and military sovereignty well they're racing right
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:36.160]  now to get rid of American monetary sovereignty and whether the military is
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:40.160]  ready sovereign or not it's up for debate to vote but it's certainly no
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:44.480]  debate stay there let's come back and talk about it and to transfer all our

[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:19.920]  being hacked again we were hit with a distributed denial of service attack
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:26.080]  last year on info wars in prison planet when we were exposing the swine flu at
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:31.440]  the height of the government hysteria now proven to be a hoax and we were hit
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:35.520]  yesterday and it took down prison planet TV for about three hours there was some
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:38.200]  other stuff going on with the other sides we beef those up wasn't too bad of a
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:42.400]  problem they're now hitting us again since about one o'clock today about an
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:46.520]  hour and a half ago but we've beefed it up people can still get on watch the
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:50.680]  films watch the live show right now simulcast at prison planet TV and living
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:56.720]  color and read my book Paul Watson's book all the accesses there so counter this
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:01.360]  attempted censorship by getting a prison planet TV membership six years up and
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:06.040]  running in April coming up okay going back to G. Edward Griffin G. Edward when
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.520]  I was doing my David Rockefeller imitations I was interrupting you see
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:13.440]  we're talking about solutions to kick out the parasites I think number one my
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:17.480]  job is to expose them for the criminal parasites they are the citizens need to
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:22.440]  do that to awaken more but with the awakened mass we have we have to start
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:27.680]  moving in to the power centers to re infuse the Bill of Rights Constitution
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:32.480]  and rugged individualism please continue well that pretty well sums it all I can
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:37.080]  do is cover the same ground Alex that's the the fact of the matter is that
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:42.720]  humans have this this instinct to follow and to cluster into groups and follow
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:49.200]  leaders and that we have this herd instinct is no denying it and so we we
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:54.240]  tend to follow the opinion leaders of our country or the political leaders of
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:59.040]  our country we before we make up our minds we say well what did what did they
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:02.920]  say about this on the news you know what that sort of thing it's silly but
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:07.320]  everybody has that instinct and so our opponents have figured that out long ago
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:10.920]  they decided okay we'll just be the leadership of all of these power
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:16.000]  centers of opinion forming groups and then one percent or less of us can
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.840]  control the other 99 percent no problem and they're right that's the way it's
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:24.360]  actually that's the way it's always done but they have perfected it they've
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.560]  made a real science out of it here in this country and so the solution is not
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:32.480]  just to say my goodness what are we going to do and the solution is to reverse
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:40.760]  that process we have to go into those areas of influence and become the
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.520]  new leaders and replace the old leaders that's all there is to it there is no
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:49.640]  other solution the idea that well if we can just find one man one man like a
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:54.200]  Ron Paul or somebody else and put him in the White House that'll take care of
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:57.840]  everything but that's nonsense one man first of all is not going to get
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:02.120]  elected if you've got all of the media against him and the educational system
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:06.160]  against them and and all the unions against them you know and everybody's
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:09.600]  against them there these organizations I should say maybe the people would be
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:13.280]  for him but the people would be convinced that he doesn't stand a chance
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:17.080]  because of what the media says and so forth so you could never get the man
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:21.400]  elected into the White House in the first place without having some influence
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:26.440]  of these other power centers but even if you did take that example for just a
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:31.200]  hypothetical example he wouldn't be able to do anything because he'd be blocked
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:36.000]  on every side by and by the way Ron Paul has said that he said he's just a
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.160]  focal point of education to run other campaign for liberty type people at the
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:44.720]  state and federal level and then it's all part of a process and that it's the
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:49.840]  power of the people that is going to do this yes and then you take it one step
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:55.200]  further and say that even you know even if he were not blocked and that he could
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:39:00.560]  do great and wonderful things he wouldn't because the kind of guy we're
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:04.560]  talking about would want to follow the Constitution and the Constitution says
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:09.000]  that the president doesn't do anything except probably orders of Congress and
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.640]  that's what he has said that's the that's the problem that's exactly the
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:16.000]  problem and so we say well let's put let's put a man in a white horse in
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.480]  charge and just let him be a dictator for us no no no no it doesn't work that
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:26.160]  way or we don't want it to work that way so we're back to the to the drawing
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:31.960]  boards which is the only way to solve this problem in my view is to ride the
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:37.400]  wave of this mass educational awareness that you and I and others are trying to
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:43.480]  create and then out of the mass numbers that come forth there will be maybe one
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:48.160]  percent of those people who will say bye golly I'm going to go into politics or
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:51.800]  I'm going to stand up at my union meeting so I'm going to become influential
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:56.320]  here and there I'm going to be part of the new leadership and that is when
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:00.000]  things finally begin to happen and that's going to take a little time but
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  it's a proven formula we know it will work and I'm happy to say that right
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.040]  now I'm convinced it is going to work
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:13.520]  continue well how do I think it's going to work I see it already happening we
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:17.520]  get letters all the time emails phone calls from people say you know we've
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:24.600]  decided to follow your your advice we ran for city council six months ago and
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:30.280]  Lord be home we won and somebody will say well I've decided this year I'm going
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:34.680]  to declare my candidacy in the congressional seat in my district yes
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:40.760]  it's it's held right now by a very staunch well-known political figure but
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:45.120]  nobody really likes them it's just that nobody has a choice so we're going to
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:49.560]  offer a choice well this is just the beginning of that kind of a thing once
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:55.000]  every year we have thousands of people making that kind of a decision and if
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.840]  they have the smarts of being able to organize a well-run well thought out and
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:05.520]  well-funded political campaign once that starts to happen and it is starting to
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:10.800]  happen now but once this this wave becomes large enough I think that's a
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:15.200]  that's the point at the tipping point but we can restore the republic that's
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:22.880]  and let's be clear about this we lost nine out of ten conservatively of the
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:25.960]  battles against the British during that seven-year war but it was the
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:32.160]  perseverance and with a few little victories like Trenton then that began
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:37.040]  the shift of momentum as people began to realize they did have power they could
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.560]  win so take a Debra Medina she runs for governor it's 19 percentage points out
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:47.680]  of nowhere that spurred masses of other people to start running in their state
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:51.400]  so we may not win every time but we're out there getting the message out just
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:57.400]  like Ron Paul didn't win in 2008 but it got the real issues out there about the
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:02.840]  inflation tax the wars that conservatives don't have to be warmongers he
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:08.760]  won the CPAC straw poll but the bigger issue is once we support Patriot
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:12.400]  candidates and if they start flip-flopping you got to drop them immediately
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:16.600]  there has to be a code that we don't just run and then start getting some
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:21.080]  power and flip-flop if that happens you got to drop somebody you got to go with
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:25.400]  people that are steadfast and have proven that they won't waffle that they
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:31.240]  won't give in but take the global warming hoax it's completely collapsing the
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:33.920]  masses are waking up to it the establishment doesn't care though they
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:36.840]  said they're going ahead with it but so that fight will continue but we're
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:41.160]  seeing that we're gaining momentum we're we're we're getting purchase we're
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.200]  getting a toehold we're having successes the flu was exposed as a fraud
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:49.760]  record numbers of people said no the Wall Street Journal reported the lowest
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:55.880]  level ever for both seasonal and the swine flu shot and lo and behold less
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:59.440]  flu because we know the flu shots giving people the flu many studies show
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:03.800]  we're seeing victories against so far the health care bill it's completely
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:07.400]  unpopular the democrats are destroying themselves if they pass it but the point
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:12.120]  is we do see the momentum really shifting well yes I'm glad you brought
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:17.320]  that up because although I think we all can take a great encouragement from that
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:22.600]  there's an area involved in that issue that is generally being ignored and it
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:27.760]  scares the heck out of me which is that under these conditions it is extremely
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:34.880]  easy for someone from the other side to provide false leadership I can tell you
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:40.000]  that well what what's an example the Federal Reserve system by which I know a
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:47.640]  little it was actually sold to the American people not entirely but
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:52.840]  partially because the very people who drafted the Federal Reserve pretended
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:57.520]  that it was that they were opposed to it in other words they led their own
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:02.840]  opposition to make sure that the opposition would fail and who is that
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:07.160]  today it's it's Glenn back Sarah Palin I mean clearly they're the Judas
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:11.320]  Iscariots exactly I would I would certainly say that's an easy choice but
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:14.840]  they're out there and some of them I'm not sure that there are some of them that
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.840]  could come on your radio show and agree with everything you say and agree with
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:23.560]  everything I say and say a few other good things and yet they could be just
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:27.880]  planning to get elected so that people would say how we got a good man elected
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:32.640]  yet they won't do anything they'll buckle as you say and that points to the
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:36.960]  fact that when we say that they're going to buckle or they're going to switch
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:40.880]  it's because we've never asked these candidates what they really believe we
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:45.240]  we've seen what they said we've heard what they said we said well they're
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:50.480]  against the swine flu charade they're they want to get us out of the war and
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:57.560]  at least so forth heck Obama said that but you know that what they say is not
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:01.280]  important it's what they do and nobody's asking these candidates what do they
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:06.200]  believe what are their principles what's their ideology and that's where I come
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:09.680]  into the war because as you know with freedom force we're totally focused on
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.200]  ideology we have a creative freedom and we want our candidates who are going into
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:19.400]  office to say yes this is my creed I believe this these are not issues these
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:24.480]  are principles you know I believe as you know that the individual is more
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:28.040]  important than the group and that the group must not that the individual must
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:32.520]  not be sacrificed in the name of the group that's a firm principle you know
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:38.160]  and we believe that all laws should apply to all groups of people equally not
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:45.280]  any exceptions none zilch zil nuda nunca you know this is a principle well
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:50.560]  anybody that says yes I believe that would have to vote against all of this
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:54.920]  nonsense progressive income tax for example does that treat all groups
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:59.120]  equally no it starts out from the very beginning to treat those who are making
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.680]  more money in a different class and those are making less money and those who
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:07.560]  have got certain political connections can get exemptions that other people
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:11.480]  cannot if you're married and you've got 25 kids you don't have to pay any tax
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:16.280]  whereas if you're not married and you have 25 kids you do pay tax and so this
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:22.080]  doesn't treat everybody the same so anyway my point is that now is the time
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:26.680]  for a lot of candidates to come forth and they'll speak very brilliantly against
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:31.440]  all the bad things that are going on it's time to ask them oh wait okay now we
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:36.120]  know what you're against now what do you believe what are you for what are your
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:40.360]  principles what kind of a new system are you going to create and then just sit
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:45.000]  back and see what they say all right gee ever to Griffin always amazing having
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.760]  you want to take some calls here in the last 14 minutes we have but fire out
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:54.360]  the websites for new listeners well the commercial website where we sell books
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:47:00.080]  and videos and recordings is called reality zone reality zone dot com you
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:04.480]  find about a hundred different items there but our think tank site where we
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:08.720]  talk about issues like we're discussing today that's our organizational site for
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:14.160]  freedom force international and the URL for that is freedom force
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:19.840]  international org so that's the place I hope people will go and spend some time
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:25.520]  reading about these ideological issues absolutely let's go to Brian in Texas
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:30.120]  you're on the air with G. Edward Griffin go ahead how you doing Alex good go
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:35.040]  ahead actually one thing I wanted to mention I think one thing you guys are
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:38.240]  what we need to do is really take the wind out of the sails of these guys
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:42.200]  instead of using a leak to describe many more we need to we need to take that
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:46.280]  back out of of any description of these guys because truthfully parasite
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:51.440]  criminals the ruling criminals well no I just mean as far as correcting other
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:55.080]  individuals when we hear them saying it in the common day even as far as like
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:48:00.760]  Obama's public servants authorities officials and I always point that out
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:05.960]  gee ever do you have a comment on that amen that's about it how about the king
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:10.680]  parasites don't they and I think your callers right Brian is right we give
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:15.720]  them too much respect what's a good term for him then a king parasites mafia
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:22.680]  rulers illegitimate scum I mean what do you call them I guess it depends on the
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:25.800]  occasion you don't want to you don't want to offend people the object is not
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:30.480]  just the spit out what do we call the ruling class the ruling criminals what's
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:37.000]  wrong with the ruling class let people decide for themselves whether they're
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.320]  criminals you know I think sometimes we tend to force our editorial conclusions
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:47.160]  on people I think we probably would be better off that we just stuck more with
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:52.040]  a historical fact and let people put the twist to it that they want okay good
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:55.720]  point anything else Brian yeah I actually had one other point I wanted to ask
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:59.760]  G Edward directly the release of this and now she touched on it earlier in the
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:03.960]  week Adam could don issue if they found them they didn't find them you know do
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:06.880]  you think that's a pretext of them trying to gain sympathy for homeland
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:12.080]  security to come in and start going after you know tea party goers conspiracy
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:17.680]  theorists things like that I think so go ahead Alex no no go ahead well I think
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:23.560]  so yeah they want to keep the at that mentality of fear always present and so
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:28.240]  they've got to talk about terror threats and red alert and yellow alerts and so
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:31.480]  forth that's constantly there well Governor Ridge admitted in his book last
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:34.760]  year they issued fake alerts thank Brian thank you Brian and by the way that's a
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:40.560]  violation of the Patriot Act to issue a fake terror threat let's talk to Doug in
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.960]  Tennessee you're on the air Doug hey Alex I want to deal with Brian said we
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:50.440]  need to stop calling them authorities and stop telling them telling that they
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:53.720]  have authorities they're beyond their authority they have power but they don't
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:59.200]  have authorities but I watched a video the other day that really inspired me
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:05.280]  it's called the solution it's on YouTube the solution by a Shaffer Cox and you
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:10.480]  can find it also on Lincoln County watch org and what they're doing do you
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:14.160]  have a question do you have a griffin well this is the solution he was talking
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:19.000]  about you know what do we do and I what they're doing up there in Fairbanks
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:26.160]  Alaska is setting up their own court and having a common law court and they
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:30.920]  also have a militia for enforcement and they have a call in line where people
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:36.600]  can call like a 9-1-1 type situation when their rights are being violated by
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:40.480]  you know even police off well I don't want to pass judgment on this but I've
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:44.000]  seen this a hundred times a hundred this is very dangerous what you're talking
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.200]  about there is a common law our courts set up through the state
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:52.960]  constitutions are supposedly carrying it out but they're not but we'll talk we'll
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:56.440]  get G. Everett's griffin's take on what you just talked about on the other side
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:59.360]  dog we'll be right back
[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:05.200]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non

[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:13.880]  I was up at info wars.com reading the article about the pervert behavior
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:17.600]  of government naked body scanning us cameras in school bathrooms the girl
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:23.200]  showers and people are posting links to articles where they check girls panties
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:27.200]  in school making sure they're the right color and everyone's agreeing yeah that
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:31.680]  happens at my school and it's just there's a method of the madness it's
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:35.760]  about training you that you have absolutely no rights and you're like a
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:39.520]  slave it's like we're gonna strip you down and make you naked before we heard
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:46.400]  you into the showers and it's just the power tripping government going
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:50.760]  completely insane but but shifting gears back to G. Edward Griffin
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:56.080]  G. Edward Griffin I've seen these common law courts over and over again
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:00.800]  people always get mad say no they're real this local guy says it is and then
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:09.160]  and then people you know get arrested I mean you have to use if a city sets up
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:13.120]  an unlawful court they get in trouble from the state and it's all chartered
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:17.440]  through the state and the state is out of control we have to take it back but
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:23.720]  what about these citizen courts we hear about and and all of this well I'm
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:28.560]  certainly not an expert on that Alex but I do have two rather strong thoughts on
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:35.440]  it one is that I think they're dangerous because although the people who are
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:40.560]  forming them today appear to be well motivated they appear to be reacting in
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:47.800]  righteous indignation which is I'm glad to see that reacting against all the the
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:52.640]  bad things that are being done by their national and regional governments still
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:57.560]  they go out and they form these courts of these militias but they have no they
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:03.440]  have no rules they have no limitations they don't they're really like like a
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:08.800]  lynch mob in a way there's there's no limit to their power and they really
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:12.680]  what they're doing is they're advocating the formation of a government this is
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:17.680]  the essence of government to use organized force to compel other people
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:23.240]  to comply with what you want them to do so although they are they're sure in
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:27.280]  their mind that what they want other people to do is right I don't see any
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:31.480]  rules and regulations I don't see any constitutions I don't see any limitations
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:34.800]  on their power or no they're gonna say they're following the common law in the
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:40.920]  Constitution my issue is the states are chartered by the people we have the
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:45.360]  state constitutions the counties are created through that the cities are
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:50.160]  chartered by that and our days of data without a law can't go shut down a gun
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:55.240]  show and so the only way these courts have any basis is a citizen's arrest I
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:59.720]  mean when you have lawless police operating outside the common law shutting
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:05.000]  down a gun show the citizens have a innate right to say no to it but the
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.400]  problem is the criminal government's gonna come after you well yeah they're
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:11.520]  that's the other issue that I said there are two thoughts came to mind and the
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:16.000]  other issue is that even if all these constitutional issues were solved how
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.600]  are they going to enforce it sooner or later they're gonna have to be able to
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:22.960]  get in the trenches and and shoot it out with the established so-called
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:26.040]  authorities I yeah they're playing a new game now there you know they're trying
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:29.200]  to say that that they're a new government to the big mafia government
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:32.440]  instead of taking the system of the government back and all I'm saying is
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:35.640]  folks don't play in traffic I mean I think it's fine if you have committees
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:39.640]  and meetings and videotape it and hand out the citizen's commission verdict
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:43.240]  and then go to the grand jury with it and and you know I think it's great to
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:47.080]  investigate or sue politicians I just I mean how many times we read about these
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:49.920]  citizen courts and they go off and do something and then they and then it
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:53.720]  turns into a nightmare yeah right well yeah there's no that I like your
[01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:57.320]  expression don't play in traffic it's very dangerous and I don't think people
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:01.560]  have fought it all the way through well anyway I've written a little bit on
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:07.480]  vigilante action and that's very close to this topic vigilantes have a very
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:12.560]  interest interesting history in America and generally it's a positive history
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:18.600]  believe it or not vigilantes usually spring up when their local sheriff or
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:23.960]  some local government official who has duly yeah authority has been abusing
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:27.320]  jeb we're out of time I want to thank you for coming on but I want to add this

[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:18.680]  him even more a horrible sickening criminal parasite thank you for joining
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:23.560]  us sir thank you very much and yes I think given that what people like Van
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:26.880]  Rumpier doing is robbing us of our democracy and robbing us of our
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:30.920]  ability to determine our own futures I think I was quite moderate really I
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:35.440]  think you were I mean this guy wants to take 45 trillion from us and give it to
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:38.680]  himself he's unelected the whole climate thing has been proven to be a
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:43.720]  fraud I mean he's he's heading up a criminal enterprise it is extraordinary
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:48.520]  and and of course you know he's not been put there by any democratic means he
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:53.960]  can't be removed by any democratic means and he was talking openly on Rumpier
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:57.880]  this week in Brussels about the move towards world government nothing
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:01.760]  hidden anymore they're not even pretending anymore this is what some of
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:06.000]  these people are pushing for yes Paul Watson in prison planet two days ago
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.720]  with another article with multiple quotes of him saying global governance
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:14.520]  global government I mean and it's undemocratic the financial times of
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:18.240]  London admits it's undemocratic England's already under it even though you haven't
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:22.480]  voted to be part of it I mean when does this end well you know some things in
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:26.320]  life have to get worse before they can get better I think the fact that they're
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:31.160]  being totally open now about their ambitions shows that they think it's in
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:34.600]  the back shows they think they've done the deal they're the winners it's all
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:40.480]  over and of course when people get as arrogant as that then you know the old
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:45.360]  saying that pride comes before a fall it will come but you know it's difficult
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:49.400]  to see in the depth of a time like this exactly what the catalyst will be but I
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:53.640]  just know from my travels I'm talking to you guys across your side of the pond
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:58.320]  and I just know there is a growing awareness a growing feeling amongst
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:01.560]  tens of millions of people they're beginning to wake up to what's being done
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:08.880]  to them and it can't go on well said let's talk about the punishment you're
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:15.600]  going to undergo what can they do to you well yes I have got to report to the
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:21.360]  headmaster's study at midday on Tuesday it's also reminiscent of being for a
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:27.320]  court smoking at school isn't it send off to take your six of the best wax or
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:31.920]  whatever it may be I'm going to his office at midday and his request
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:37.920]  obviously I think that over the last couple of days business escalated into a
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:43.360]  diplomatic crisis because the Prime Minister of Belgium the non-country as
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:47.760]  I called it the Prime Minister of Belgium is demanding an apology and
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:53.200]  demanding that this doesn't ever happen again so I think they're going to ask
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:57.280]  me to apologize they don't want you to to continue to point out the obvious
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:01.640]  that especially Belgium and other nations are fully controlled now by the
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:05.920]  unelected EU you have the unelected von Rumpi telling you an elected member of
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:15.920]  the Parliament to shut up absolutely I am guessing that I'll go and see them
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:21.040]  next week I'll be told to apologize I'm going to point blank refuse I have
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:24.440]  nothing to apologize for I mean telling the truth should not be something for
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:28.160]  which I have to apologize or confess I mean crikey we're back to the days of
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:32.080]  Stalin and the show trials I'm with I'm guessing they're going to suspend me from
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:35.840]  the Parliament or something like that well let him do it I don't care that'll
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:40.920]  only draw more attention to this a viperous viperous little demonic
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:45.320]  creature I mean von Rumpi just his whole demeanor not just his actions is like
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:50.760]  a charry I mean they they they look like something out of Oliver Twist or
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:55.760]  something classic classic villains stay there Nigel Farage a UK member of the
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:05:03.080]  European Union Parliament will be right back in three short minutes hundreds of
[02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:07.280]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:12.280]  chance to not relive history as a finishing off this agenda that we're
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:14.880]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:19.840]  have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:25.320]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:29.480]  pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:34.680]  criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:38.720]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:42.400]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:47.480]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:53.560]  a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info

[02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:14.640]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:18.480]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:22.080]  our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of

[02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:11.400]  of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis the climate conference in
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:17.040]  Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet
[02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:21.920]  Genesis Communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:28.240]  because there's a war on for your mind the Bilderberg group documents from their
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:33.840]  founding meeting in 1954 cover by the BBC a few years ago reported they wanted to
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:37.280]  set up the European Union they said Hitler had failed to take over
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:42.000]  militarily that the European Union will be established and then economically take
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.440]  over the planet now they admit the European Union unelected the separate
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:50.760]  group of bureaucrats that control the nations are now telling the elected
[02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:54.880]  members like Nigel Farage from the UK part of the European Union Parliament
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:59.880]  that he can't criticize Herman von Roompi and he joins us now he's being
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:06.560]  called in next Tuesday to be a chastised recap that mr Farage and you're
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:12.000]  saying you're not going to apologize to von Roompi or to anyone else and you
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:17.520]  expect to be suspended and how does that work how long will you be out of the
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:22.120]  Parliament difficult to tell and the Parliament hasn't really the European
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:26.240]  Parliament hasn't ever really had to deal with anyone like me you've had the
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:29.800]  odd person that's made a protest because they wanted to get a particular story
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:34.280]  aired at a moment in time but what they've never had in the European Parliament
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:39.440]  they've not had a leader of a group in the Parliament who is utterly
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:44.880]  implacably opposed in principle to robbing nation-state to their democracy
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:51.160]  so in the past miscreants have been fine two or three days pay and the odd
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:55.000]  person has been suspended for two or three days but they've never really had
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.880]  anybody who persistently has done this and I was called in back in December
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:06.000]  and told that my behavior was unacceptable I called Roompi and the
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.400]  Foreign Minister Baroness Ash and I called them political pigmars which I thought was
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:15.840]  again a very gentle description really but I was told that oh no no no you
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:19.120]  know you must never talk like that again so I just don't know what they're gonna
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:23.160]  do but I would suspect that they'll suspend me for a week or something like
[02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:29.680]  that expanding on this for those that don't know listening in the US and
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:34.400]  around the world when you talk about the bureaucrats being unelected absorbing
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:38.520]  England even though your nation's never been able to vote on this Lord Moncton
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:42.560]  and many others yourself have talked about as much as 80% of your laws are
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:47.080]  not even British laws they're just bureaucracy handed down Obama's now
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:52.800]  saying he doesn't care of the US Senate won't ratify and won't go along with the
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:57.200]  failed treaty and won't pass this bill he's just going to order the bureaucracy
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:02.120]  to do it so this is rule by unelected bureaucracies but break down the EU model
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:06.360]  for those that don't understand the way you work is there is a thing called the
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:12.640]  European Commission and there are 27 people each is appointed not elected but
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:19.080]  appointed by their own member state and either in country and each of them has a
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:23.480]  job title and a brief so you have you know someone in charge of health and
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:30.680]  someone in charge of EU extension etc etc they have beneath them 30,000
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:38.120]  bureaucrats and the European Commission has the sole right within the European
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:44.320]  Union to propose legislation and the sole right to repeal amend or change
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:49.280]  legislation so what happens is the Commission comes up with a law it gives
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:52.520]  it to the Parliament the Parliament messes around with it the Parliament can
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:57.160]  delay it a little bit and then in the end it gets rubber-stamped further down
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:02.040]  the line by more civil servants so everything the way in which our laws
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:06.400]  are actually drawn up in the European Commission the whole process is done
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:12.000]  entirely in secret the relationship of course because with those commissioners
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:18.680]  and big business is distinctly unhealthy and it is a remarkable thing to think
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:25.160]  that it is the bureaucrats that make law and the Parliamentarians that just
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:29.760]  sit around with the implication and that in essence is a model of this system we
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:33.880]  cannot vote for commissioners we cannot remove commissioners it is the
[02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:41.120]  absolute destruction of democracy and the victory of bureaucracy so here's a
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:45.120]  cheap analogy tell me if you agree they're hanging England and the rest of
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:54.000]  the former sovereign nations at a hangman's gallows but you get to
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.600]  decide the color of the rope that is put around your neck you get to decide
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:04.040]  what color a bullet is painted that's put in a handgun and fired into your
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:17.160]  head the last time I came on your show I told you about Greece if you remember
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:21.320]  and how Greece was signed up for the single currency and things weren't
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:25.720]  working well now this week we've had a general strike in Greece we've had the
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:30.880]  police using tear gas rubber bullets all this kind of thing a war of words
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:35.560]  beginning to break out between Greek politicians and German politicians so
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:40.000]  even as they kind of put the finishing touches with this recent treaty they got
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.560]  through as they've got their new president in in Van Rompuy they've got
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:49.520]  their foreign minister in Ashton even if it appears that they've succeeded
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:53.960]  actually the cracks and contradictions within the system are showing that
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:59.760]  actually this empire isn't gonna last very long the inherent tyranny is
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:04.240]  there for all to see and I see polls in Europe every time a country like France
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:07.640]  or others gets to vote on some new EU expansion they don't normally let
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:11.600]  nations even have a vote like England and others they vote to get out they
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:15.240]  don't they don't want it and I've seen it in Reuters I've seen reports out of
[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:19.080]  Spain and Greece where government officials are saying big banks just like
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:24.040]  Iceland engineered this collapse the EU has set it up so that Greece will fully
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:28.680]  become bankrupt and be completely absorbed into the system and you alluded
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:34.560]  to that when you were chastising and calling Van Rompuy out on the carpet a
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:38.000]  few days ago here is a quick clip of that
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.440]  I said though that you're competent and capable and dangerous and I have no doubt
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:49.080]  that it's your intention to be the quiet assassin of European democracy and of the
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:53.880]  European nation-states you appeared to have a loathing for the very concept of
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:58.440]  the existence of nation-states perhaps that's because you come from Belgium
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:04.640]  which of course is pretty much a non-country okay so in in layman's
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:08.000]  words I mean you're not exaggerating this is even in the newspapers all over
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:13.920]  Europe the EU is this predatory bureaucracy globally setting up carbon
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:21.000]  taxes 45 trillion you even have fishers within the EU with some of the moral
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:26.920]  people the 47 member health board with Wolfgang Wodard came on the show and
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:32.400]  said they found out that the EU and the in the UN work were literally getting
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:37.600]  money from big pharma to all of their heads bribes to lie about the swine flu
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:43.240]  so it's just all a giant global corporate system corporations coming in
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:48.160]  banks coming in and using this government holding company to literally
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:52.560]  engage in piracy yeah it all fits together the handing gloves you know
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:57.440]  the big businesses the bureaucrats they have the sole right to make laws you
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:01.240]  know it all fits together they're all very happy with the world they're
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:07.560]  creating but the optimistic thing the optimistic thing is you know whatever
[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:14.000]  happens to Greece you know at some point in time there's gonna be a revolution
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.880]  where the Greeks fight and insist to get back their own country and their
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:23.640]  ability to run it this stuff tearing me you know it can be an awful thing it can
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:28.440]  last for it can last for years but in the end all these things break up and I
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:35.320]  just I'm hopeful I'm hopeful that people are waking up to this and I just
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:39.520]  don't think that having a single currency for countries as different as
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:46.120]  Germany and Greece it can't work it just can't work so I'm you know I did they
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:49.320]  appear to have all the cards at the moment but we're winning the battle of
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:53.520]  public opinion and that's just what we got today philosophers have said it many
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:17:01.560]  different ways but to paraphrase it adversity makes men and you know easy
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:07.480]  times makes makes weak weak passive people and because our ancestors fought
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:13.320]  so hard in England the birthplace of the Magna Carta and then 1776 and 1789 here
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:16.640]  in the United States which was the light of liberty for the world the model
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:21.960]  against feudalism and all the forms of tyranny and slavery people got fat and
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:27.000]  decadent now the pendulum swung towards tyranny and it's creating that awakening
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  and that rediscovery of freedom and you calling him out not letting him be the
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.640]  quiet assassin is devastating them and they look very afraid of you yeah they
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:42.120]  are the terrified you know they really are scared because they know that I'm
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:46.640]  articulating a view that is already held by tens of millions of people across the
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:51.240]  European countries and their real fear of course is if we have a proper big
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:54.680]  debate about these issues then the numbers who support me will double or
[02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:59.920]  travel from where they are now so they are scared very very scared and and it's
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:04.080]  remarkable when you think about it that but in that parliament this week you know
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:08.640]  there was the president there were all the commissioners the leaders of the
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:13.360]  European socialist groups and all the rest of it and it's just little me and
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:19.080]  yet they're absolutely scared with this so I'm gonna go on scaring them even if
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:24.560]  I have to have a short holiday away from the problem because they suspended
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:29.000]  let's talk about his global government comments because he's really out in the
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:32.760]  open you said this week and I saw in the news he's just spouting off about what
[02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:36.000]  they're gonna do with our lives and how they rule us specifically what was
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.800]  von Rumpi saying about the global government
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:44.640]  von Rumpi spoke and he firstly talked about the need not just for a single
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:49.080]  currency in Europe but for a full economic government of Europe and that
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:54.240]  wasn't particularly surprising he said similar things to that before but what he
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:59.600]  said was that he was very encouraged by moves that he'd seen through the G20 and
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:04.360]  elsewhere which presumably means the United Nations he was very encouraged to
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:09.200]  see that we were now starting to deal with global problems on a global
[02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:14.960]  governmental basis and by that of course he means climate change taxes by that of
[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:21.760]  course he means you know attitudes towards ultimately tax and stand so I
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:27.280]  mean this guy you know I've never heard I've never heard anybody inside those EU
[02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:32.160]  institutions ever openly talk about world government talk about global
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:35.160]  solutions to problems it's one of those things that's been talked about in the
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:40.080]  corridors it is now out in the open it just shows you how mad and dangerous
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:45.040]  these people are doesn't it they're making their move Nigel Farage a UK member
[02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:48.280]  of the European Union Parliament will be with us on the other side will give you

[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:18.920]  Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:24.000]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:29.040]  American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies
[02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:34.080]  of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:38.240]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're
[02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:42.280]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make

[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:13.440]  He'll be back with us. Von Rumpi deserves to be pulled down, deserves to be
[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:19.680]  insulted to demystify this unelected scallywag. But I mean, was it your tactic
[02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:23.600]  to add some insults so it made even more news so people would actually look at
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:29.760]  the facts you laid out about him trying to assassinate sovereignty? A, B, the next
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:32.880]  time you get to addressing, hopefully you would just bring up the heat. I mean, I
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:36.760]  know you have before that he's unelected. He wants global government and that his
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:40.840]  whole carbon system is a fraud. But I know other members of your party in the
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:43.200]  parliament are also now exposing him.
[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:48.440]  To be honest with you, this was the first time he appeared before the European
[02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:54.400]  parliament. And my plan going in was to basically say, who are you? No one's ever
[02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:59.640]  heard of you. How can you have power? How can you have a salary that is bigger
[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:03.680]  than the President of the United States of America? How can you have these 30
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:08.040]  staff working for you? How can you have an incredible tax scheme where you only
[02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:14.040]  pay 17% income tax? How can you have a 5 million euro pool of money which you can
[02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:19.840]  dip into as and when you like? So that was my plan was to say that. But I
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:25.640]  listened to his speech and it was so boring. It was so dull. It was limp. It
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:30.840]  was lifeless. It was just so ghastly. But that's where I suddenly thought, well,
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:35.840]  what I'm going to have to say is, sir, you have all the charisma of a damn reg.
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:40.520]  And let's be clear. Many countries in Europe have over a 50% income tax. France
[02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:44.480]  even higher. But the EU made their own jurisdiction where their ministers and
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:49.800]  bureaucrats pay 17% or lower. So they're exempt from taxes. I mean, this is classic
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:54.880]  textbook tyranny. Nigel Farage, plug the UK Independence Party website. Your
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:26:00.340]  strategy across the world to get people to unseat these globalist controlled
[02:26:00.340 --> 02:26:07.920]  puppets. Yeah, I mean, let's find out what we're doing. Go to UKIP.org, UKIP.org, and
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:12.200]  you'll find what we're up to. We are a party that started with nothing. A few of
[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:16.640]  us in a pub in London, and we've taken that on. And last year, we came second
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:20.880]  across the entire UK in the direct elections to the European Parliament.
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:25.880]  And my message to everybody the world over is do not under any circumstances
[02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:30.240]  vote for people who will give away your liberties and rights. Do not vote for
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:34.840]  people who are supporting the growth of global government. If it means going for
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:39.720]  new candidates, if it means going for new passes, do it. Don't think it's hopeless.
[02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:43.960]  It isn't. We're proving it can be done. And when you're doing it, remember that in
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:50.040]  the end, good will always triumph over tyranny. And you and many others are the
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:54.480]  model for others to believe they can have success. We've got almost 40 states. It's
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:58.840]  at 37, 38 now, moving to declare 10th and 9th Amendment power over the federal
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:03.480]  government itself seized by foreign banks and government institutions. And so
[02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:09.240]  there is a massive awakening worldwide. And all over the planet, the third world
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:12.960]  three months ago wouldn't sign on at Copenhagen. They know the scam. I mean,
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:16.840]  I mean, we've really got the people. Yeah, the scale of the falling. They really
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:22.720]  are, aren't they? People do not believe or trust their political classes. They're
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:27.520]  right not to trust them. And we're now seeing that moving into active, real
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:31.640]  politics. And hey, to a large extent, what I was able to do this week to the
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:35.720]  president of the European Parliament is living proof that if something's wrong,
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:39.360]  you got to get out there, hold your chin up and do things differently and fight
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:42.720]  hard. That's what we've done. We're making progress. I want others to do so
[02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:43.760]  right across the world.
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:46.640]  And you hadn't been politically active. You just saw this and stood up
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:52.160]  yourself. Just a few years ago and look at all the success. You was the
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:53.280]  progenitor of this.
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.280]  I was in business, you know, but I don't come from one of these ruling class
[02:27:57.280 --> 02:28:01.600]  families or anything like that. I was just an ordinary bloke who just felt
[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:06.560]  that something was horribly wrong. And I felt if there was nobody out there
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:10.000]  that was prepared to stand up and say the right things, I jolly well do it.
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:14.200]  And in doing so, I've met some good people on the way. People like Lord
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:18.520]  Monkton, people like Godfrey Bloom that you've had on your show. And, you know,
[02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:21.960]  there are others out there who felt like me. So it's been an extraordinary
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:25.440]  journey. But it's only what we're not finished yet. We're going to beat the
[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:26.160]  so-and-so's.
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:29.520]  We are. If we have the will to stand and fight, and you're a great example,
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:33.560]  in the last minute we've got left, an individual website or how do we support
[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:36.480]  you individually? You have a lot of listeners in England and give out the
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:38.480]  UK Independence Party website one more time.
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:44.840]  Yeah, just simply go to UKIP.org and you'll see me, you'll see Lord Monkton.
[02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:49.000]  If you dig deeper, you'll see our thoughts on our failing education system
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:53.360]  in Britain. You'll see our thoughts on our failing public health care system.
[02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:56.600]  You know, we're a party that believes in less government, that believes in
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:29:00.200]  small government, that believes in liberty, freedom of the individual.
[02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:03.600]  And they're the things we fight for. If you look at UKIP.org, you'll see links
[02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:06.520]  to all sorts of other things. You'll see links to my own websites.
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:08.680]  But that's the first place to look.
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:13.320]  And in closing, I saw another BBC article yesterday about the government
[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:17.520]  secretly bringing in foreigners. And I saw that six, seven years ago with
[02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:20.880]  Tony Blair. I mean, this is a lawless government.
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:27.400]  Yeah, I'm afraid, you know, we are a relatively small country geographically.
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:31.360]  Our population is going up at such a rapid rate.
[02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:36.120]  We're projected to go up to 70 million by 2020, where we were quite
[02:29:36.120 --> 02:29:41.320]  happily settled at 58 million when Mr. Blair came to power in 1997.
[02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:44.200]  We haven't got the roads. We haven't got the schools.
[02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:49.160]  We haven't got the hospitals. Nigel Farage, we're out of time.
[02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:51.880]  Thank you so much, Godspeed. We're supporting you.
[02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:55.760]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:58.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:04.320]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:07.880]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jump start your food
[02:30:07.880 --> 02:30:10.280]  savings plan from eFoodsDirect.com.

[02:30:27.160 --> 02:30:30.040]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:33.920]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food
[02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:38.000]  passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.

[02:31:06.440 --> 02:31:09.200]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:14.520]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:31:14.520 --> 02:31:19.000]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.

[02:32:57.760 --> 02:33:02.760]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:07.920]  Nearly four decades after abortion became legal, a woman's right to choose continues
[02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:10.760]  to anger millions of Americans.
[02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:15.720]  Pro-life advocates regard abortion as the killing of an unborn human.
[02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:21.320]  But according to Pastor Clenard Childress, Roe vs. Wade doesn't just target babies.
[02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:26.600]  The New Jersey Rev. says the Supreme Court ruling is being used to wipe out an entire
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:28.280]  race of people.
[02:33:28.280 --> 02:33:30.920]  Pastor Clenard Howard Childress, thank you for joining me.
[02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:31.920]  Thank you for having me.
[02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:36.440]  I understand that you are the founder of a pro-life website called blackgenocide.org.
[02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:37.440]  Yes.
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:39.520]  Why did you start this website?
[02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:46.720]  Well, when I heard the disproportionate amount of African-American women that were falling
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:54.040]  prey to the abortion industry, and knowing indeed that abortion had now had become very
[02:33:54.040 --> 02:34:02.800]  much a part of the decision-making African-American women were making or doing, the numbers staggered
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:03.800]  me.
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:14.080]  So African-American women make up 12% of the population, but 36% of the abortions.
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:22.000]  And for every at this present time, for every two African-American women to get pregnant,
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.800]  one will choose to abort, 52% of all African-American pregnancies end in abortion.
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:32.560]  And that's from Alan Gutmacher, who sat on the board at Planned Parenthood.
[02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:41.600]  So these are statistics that should cause anyone concerned, and thus blackgenocide.org.
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:48.320]  Why is it that you believe these women are victims of a system rather than making decisions
[02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:50.800]  on what they want to do?
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:56.160]  No doubt the abortion industry targets African-Americans minorities.
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:35:06.000]  78% of all Planned Parenthoods abortuaries, I call them, but clinics are located in minority
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:07.000]  neighborhoods.
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  The targeting of African-Americans has now been documented.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:17.560]  So we have to look at the abortion industry and look at the philosophic views.
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:21.120]  And minorities is something that they want less of.
[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:24.160]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg made the comment.
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:28.680]  At the time, Roe vs. Wade was decided.
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:35.840]  We believe they were trying to get rid of populations that we don't want too many of.
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:45.560]  She made that comment July 11th, 2009, and today of last year.
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:55.120]  Today we're seeing that Roe vs. Wade was not decided based on law, but based on ideology.
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:36:02.600]  Just to clarify, you're saying that abortion providers, such as Planned Parenthood, are
[02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:10.680]  purposefully trying to unleash genocide on the African-American female community.
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:11.680]  That is their intent.
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:16.800]  Well, yes, if abortion was not lucrative, it would not be legal.
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:23.080]  There's no question that Planned Parenthood, the leader of the abortion industry in this
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:28.280]  country, they account for 18% of all abortions.
[02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:33.360]  And when you look at the abortion leader and you look at their ideology and their philosophy
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:42.440]  and their roots and see where all their abortion clinics are located, in Houston, right now
[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:49.880]  they're building a mega, it's an enormous building in the African-American neighborhood
[02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:59.280]  and Hispanic, designed for completely abortion, their marketing abortion, not women's healthcare,
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:01.200]  their marketing abortion.
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:10.520]  And many people need to know, in that building, there's a floor dedicated to late-term abortions.
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:16.760]  And I want America to know, late-term abortions are still going on in this country.
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:23.960]  And so we have to understand that the ideology, the philosophic views of the eugenics movement
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:28.480]  was to target African-Americans and they're still being targeted today.
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:34.160]  Planned Parenthood provides other services other than abortions for the patients that
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:39.080]  go there, to the clinics, and all their patients are not black women.
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:44.120]  They have women that are of all race, all religions, all ethnicities.
[02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:46.920]  What do you say about all the white women that get abortions?
[02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:49.960]  Well, I'm looking at the locations.
[02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:55.160]  Locations you go to the market that you're trying to reach, and that's African-Americans.
[02:37:55.160 --> 02:38:00.080]  Anyone who studies marketing would know, indeed, that's what you do if you want to reach the
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:04.480]  Hispanic community, you don't set up in the Italian community, you set up in the Hispanic
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:05.480]  community.
[02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:11.200]  Now, as far as these other services, Planned Parenthood well knows that if they can engage
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:21.000]  our youth at a young age and be their health provider when it comes to the mindset of what
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:24.880]  they're going to do and how they're going to engage in their sexuality.
[02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:26.760]  We will sell you the condoms.
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:29.280]  We'll give you the test.
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:34.280]  We become your guru, your teacher, your mentor.
[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:40.360]  If Planned Parenthood was really interested in the health of these women, they would tell
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:45.880]  them about the obvious links between abortion and breast cancer.
[02:38:45.880 --> 02:38:53.360]  And we're going to talk about those documented, scientific, hundreds of major studies that
[02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:58.280]  every abortion you have massively increases your chance of getting different types of
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:00.720]  cancer.
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:05.440]  If your body is meant to abort a baby, 99% of the time it will.
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:08.400]  It's very unnatural.
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:13.600]  Making the film in-game blueprint for global enslavement, I didn't just believe the quotes
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:17.480]  by Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood and others even in modern times.
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:19.400]  I went to the universities.
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:24.240]  I sent off for copies of the actual letters where they call black people weeds that must
[02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:25.760]  be exterminated.
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:32.560]  And you see Bill Gates and his vaccine program clearly tied to reduced fertility, sterilization,
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:38.120]  Nobel laureates on record, even BBC reporting that women are getting HIV who've never had
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:41.440]  sex in Africa, but they've had vaccinations.
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:43.840]  They were caught in Libya doing this.
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:48.320]  We have the UN and their internal documents that I covered in in-game saying they want
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:54.800]  to force inoculate, to introduce cancer, viruses, autoimmune, viruses.
[02:39:54.800 --> 02:40:00.880]  This is going on against everyone, but going back over 100 years ago when Eugenics was
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:05.040]  like a rock and roll craze up until the 40s when Hitler embarrassed them, they then changed
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:10.360]  the name of it, blacks were the number one target because they could sell more people
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:12.520]  in the community on going along with it.
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:17.160]  On that Russia Today video piece we played half of, we'll put it back on screen.
[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:18.760]  It's abortion ink.
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:21.440]  Is it carrying out black genocide?
[02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:25.800]  Abortion ink, promoting black genocide inside the United States.
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:31.720]  In the comments, I see people in there, the minority, but still they're there saying you
[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:33.560]  black people complain about everything.
[02:40:33.560 --> 02:40:35.360]  You black people always say you're the victim.
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:38.760]  You black people always say people are out to get you.
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:40.640]  And yeah, well, there are too many black people.
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:44.160]  There are too many black thugs out there on and on and on and on.
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:50.400]  And then see once that idea has been accepted, then it could be done to everybody.
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:55.480]  I remember debating Planned Parenthood people and debating CPS when they were seizing people's
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:57.560]  kids for no reason.
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:01.200]  They would email me, write me, call me or in person say, who's going to adopt all these
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:02.200]  black babies?
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:03.200]  Are you going to do it?
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:04.760]  Yeah, we're getting rid of them.
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:08.080]  And it's come out in the news that you can call up Planned Parenthood and say, I want
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:10.480]  to give money specifically to get rid of black babies.
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:11.480]  Absolutely.
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:12.480]  We agree.
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:13.480]  We'll help you.
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:16.080]  It's a eugenics organization.
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:19.080]  And Bill Gates, his father, of course, formerly headed it.
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:21.000]  And they're all pushing this agenda right now.
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:26.040]  The carbon taxes are about cutting off everybody's resources where you can't even afford to have
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:27.600]  children now.
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:34.160]  And so I wanted to have pastor on our show today from blackgenocide.org because he's
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:40.600]  been fighting this for more than a decade and he's been standing up against this corrupt
[02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:45.840]  system and fighting for more than a decade.
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:50.960]  And so we're going to get him to break down basically what we face as a society.
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:55.440]  But the fact is there's more people wanting to adopt every year in the U.S. That's why
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:42:02.040]  people import folks from South Korea and Europe and other places and Haiti.
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:07.560]  And the truth is people do want to adopt black babies, brown babies, white babies.
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:11.000]  But the system knows this and they don't tell you when you're at Planned Parenthood that
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:16.520]  there are Christian groups who will 100% of the time pay you, take care of you, and help
[02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:17.520]  adopt the baby.
[02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:20.360]  No, they just say kill the baby.
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:24.360]  And so this is a window into a much bigger situation.
[02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:31.560]  So I've prefaced that now, but I want to go to pastor Leonard Howard Childress Jr. from
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:32.560]  blackgenocide.org.
[02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:34.560]  Pastor, thanks for joining us.
[02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:37.240]  Oh, thank you very much for having me.
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:42.120]  Break down your awakening, who you are, what you've done, your research, what we're facing
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:45.800]  here, and obviously the larger eugenics operation.
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:52.480]  Well, you know, sometimes the longer I stay in it, the more I find that it's a humongous
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:58.480]  machine that I feel the only way it could be uprooted at this point is for the church.
[02:42:58.480 --> 02:43:04.240]  The God has always used the church to deal with all social injustices.
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:12.280]  And how I began was just defending the unborn here locally in my normal teaching, did not
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:17.400]  even know such thing as the pro-life movement or pro-choice, all the terminology.
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:24.480]  And a young lady who was more involved than I was regionally asked me, did I want to get
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:26.000]  more involved in the movement?
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:31.520]  She had met one of my students walking by an abortion clinic thinking she was going to
[02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:32.520]  go in.
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:37.120]  She approached her and she said, no, my pastor taught me about this already.
[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:39.400]  And she said, well, who's your pastor?
[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:45.520]  And that led to me going to learn Life Education Resource Network.
[02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:51.600]  There was a conference down at Virginia Beach, and I felt that I should go.
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:57.960]  And my wife and myself went, and the first time I heard of the Negro Project, and even
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:07.040]  why the Akua Fero was the presenter, and I heard of the eugenics design, the mindset,
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:10.840]  the ideologies, the players, and I was stunned.
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:19.880]  And I was stunned to find, even more so, having gone to college and gone to seminary
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:26.080]  that I never heard any of these things, not so much as an iota of these things.
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:34.640]  And yet, it was prevalent, dominating, and at that time, the figure was 1,452 African-American
[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:40.240]  children killed each day, and here I was a shepherd and didn't know of this devouring
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:46.400]  agent that was preying upon the African-American community to the degree in which it was.
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:53.560]  So pastor Johnny Hunter, National Director, and I said, I have to want to partner with
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:45:04.480]  you in addressing this issue nationally and locally, and thus began my quest, and in 2001,
[02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:14.280]  I came up with the idea, but 2002, we launched the website, blackgenocide.org, and actually,
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:24.840]  a young computer, Michael Spielman, who does Abort.73, another great website if you want
[02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:29.760]  to see what abortion is, he was helping me put the site together, and we put all the
[02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:32.680]  information together, he said, what are you going to call it?
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:37.680]  And I said, ah, just call it Learn, I guess, Learn Northeast, it's just a reach, I want
[02:45:37.680 --> 02:45:42.640]  to reach the African-American community with the message of abortion, and he said, well,
[02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:46.440]  why don't you just call it Black Genocide, that's what you're always calling it any
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:53.320]  other time, and when he said it, it was like when Mary heard Elizabeth, something leaped
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:59.480]  in my womb, and I said, that's the name, Black Genocide, so we called it Black Genocide,
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:00.480]  that'll work in it.
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:07.080]  Well, we're going to break down with you the real numbers, 52%, and that's conservative,
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:12.200]  of blacks never get born, they're murdered, that is a bigger statistical genocide than
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:17.800]  we've even seen in Rwanda against the Tootsies or what we saw with Hitler.
[02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:25.160]  This is a real genocide, and eugenics is the religion of the elite, they teach it as phony
[02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:30.480]  environmentalism, that humans are a disease and a scourge, this is what funds the entire
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:34.680]  global government movement, it's what you always find, it's what all the big banks
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:41.040]  fund, and blacks are their number one target, but they're doing it to every one now, and
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:44.400]  so all these fools out there that are racist deep down and say, yeah, get rid of these
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:48.560]  black people or get rid of these brown people, you know, all the white supremacists out there,
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:52.880]  it's being done to you as well, this is for everyone, but blacks are the apple of the
[02:46:52.880 --> 02:47:00.240]  globalist eye, and I just want to add that the good news is we see national statistics,
[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:04.440]  more and more people are beginning to wake up to this, but let's break down the black
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:09.640]  genocide program, the Negro program as it was called by Margaret Sanger and the Rockefeller
[02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:14.160]  Foundation, and what these mass murderers are doing right now.
[02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:23.880]  Well, no question about it, it was a systemic design by the eugenics, the elitists of this
[02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:30.720]  nation and who are very much more empowered than I ever dreamed that they were, and the
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:38.560]  key thing was to introduce abortion and sterilization to the African American community, it varied
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:45.800]  down through the years, but of course in 1973, by their own evaluation, they finally found
[02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:54.400]  the key element to reduce the numbers of African Americans under suspicion that they would
[02:47:54.400 --> 02:48:00.560]  not be deemed as sufficient, and that was through abortion, it was also through commandeering
[02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:09.920]  key African American iconic figures to condone it, and this is the greatest strategy, you
[02:48:09.920 --> 02:48:17.760]  know, Jesse Jackson, 1977 is basically where I coined the phrase black genocide was from
[02:48:17.760 --> 02:48:23.080]  Jesse Jackson, who said abortion is black genocide, what happens to a mind of a person
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:26.760]  in the moral fabric of a nation that can abort a baby without a tank of content.
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:32.080]  And that's the one good thing about Jesse Jackson is he did come out against that, and
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:37.280]  you go back to what W.E.D. Du Bois and others, you read Margaret Singer's letters, she said,
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:40.640]  we can't let these people know we want to kill them, they don't trust us, we've got
[02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:43.840]  to get rid of these weeds, we've got to hire black leaders.
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:49.240]  Exactly, three or four colored ministers with engaging social backgrounds with their
[02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:55.400]  exact words, and Jesse, when he decided to be president, he wanted to be president,
[02:48:55.400 --> 02:49:00.480]  and he realized he wasn't going to get the money he needed unless he switched his position,
[02:49:00.480 --> 02:49:06.440]  and so he literally became a shepherd leading the sheep to the floor, and so early on he
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:10.120]  was good, but then he flip-flopped for power.
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:12.520]  How many millions of blacks have been exterminated?
[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:15.920]  16 million, and that is a conservative estimate.
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:19.880]  I mean, is a billion dollars worth it to kill 16 million of your own people or anybody?
[02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:23.960]  I mean, I mean, they could all, Satan could lead me up on a mountain and say, I will make
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:27.800]  you God on earth if you'll kill one child, and I wouldn't do it if they were black or
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:29.600]  polka-dotted or green or white.
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:31.880]  I mean, this is so evil.
[02:49:31.880 --> 02:49:38.080]  It is unquestionably evil, and it's very sad commentary to the civil rights movement
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:51.120]  because Dr. King died in 1968, and he more or less never was really a designated Joshua
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:57.200]  to come in and lead, and basically they began to fight amongst themselves for power, and
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:50:02.640]  this brought about an opportunity with Rovers of Ways, which was right around a corner,
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:09.320]  to offer money to these leaders, and they basically signed their silence and asking
[02:50:09.320 --> 02:50:12.080]  for their allegiance.
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:14.320]  And now 16 million dead people.
[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:21.080]  16 million, and then there's just the consciousness of the deaf culture being so deeply embedded
[02:50:21.080 --> 02:50:27.200]  in the African-American community, the fact that we would embrace a message that would
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:35.000]  cause a woman to do the antipical thing about life being in her, and that is to kill it.
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:46.200]  That is just the opposite of God, of faith, of a walk, of religious bringing, and so on.
[02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:52.600]  Over in Chilters, stay there, blackgenocide.org, our websites are infowars.com, and prisonplanet.tv.

[02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:20.520]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling

[02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:26.520]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.520 --> 02:52:32.000]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:36.680]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.680 --> 02:52:41.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:49.000]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:50.000]  of the Republic.

[02:53:32.640 --> 02:53:36.360]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold

[02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:41.400]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:43.080]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:46.600]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:54:22.120 --> 02:54:24.120]  to curb overpopulation.
[02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:32.800]  The Rockefeller's Ted Turner, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Secret Meeting, it says at the
[02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:38.240]  end of the article, for a world government to forcibly reduce world population.
[02:54:38.240 --> 02:54:46.480]  Now, it's a litmus test for political candidates in the Democratic Party, but the Republicans,
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:50.640]  they could have overturned this, they, most of them go along with it as well, to carry
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:52.200]  out this extermination.
[02:54:52.200 --> 02:54:59.040]  And Barack Obama, when he got in power, took the hold off of billions of dollars in Africa,
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:03.360]  so they come into villages and basically force abortions on people just like China.
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:07.120]  And if you'll adopt this, the big global system gives you all the power, because it's about
[02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:08.520]  killing.
[02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:12.920]  Just like Pharaoh demanded the firstborn be sacrificed, so many other kings throughout
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:16.000]  history demand your firstborn, or they demand your children.
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.520]  It's an act of submission, it's a death cult.
[02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:24.400]  Again, I've come through this from studying the globalist's own writings, and they know
[02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:25.840]  what they're doing.
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:32.880]  And this is going on against all communities, but the main focus of this Luciferian system
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:35.880]  is killing black people.
[02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:42.160]  Going back to the Reverend, Reverend Childress, please continue, sir, breaking down what you
[02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:47.900]  were getting into with the black leaders, the 52% of blacks never being born, and how
[02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:49.400]  we stop this.
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:55.440]  Well, and that's what listeners need to know, if two African American women get pregnant,
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:56:01.200]  one of them for sure is going to choose abortion, and at this rate, from Alan Gutmacher, who
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:06.880]  sat on the board of Planned Parenthood and probably has better stats than most of the
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:13.960]  Lucmacher Institute, he proudly reports that 52% of all African American pregnancies ended
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:14.960]  abortion.
[02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:20.760]  He also, what they failed to tell you, of course, as you've already alluded to, and thank
[02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:29.000]  God for your work, the health ramifications that are just horrific, which are never discussed.
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:36.680]  African Americans now, by using abortion nearly as a contraceptive, African American women
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:44.680]  now lead the country in preterm death rates of their children due to the fact of the multiple
[02:56:44.680 --> 02:56:51.920]  abortions doesn't allow the utero lining to have the strength enough to carry full term.
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:56.520]  And it's also been documented that these IUDs, they put women in the 70s, 80s, and 90s,
[02:56:56.520 --> 02:57:00.080]  were designed to screw up women's uteruses.
[02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:05.040]  And the same things come up with deprapovera, that it, a lot of times, really hurts women's
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:06.040]  fertility.
[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:11.400]  Folks, you need to understand, and I mean, I've seen all the big studies, they know it
[02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:13.920]  increases cancer risk having abortions.
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:24.920]  Yes, 66%, and it's just outrageous that the NAACP has fought every year since 2006 from
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:31.400]  this coming to the floor just for discussion and workshops being set up just from the health
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:38.640]  issue point of view since African American women who account only for 12% of the population
[02:57:38.640 --> 02:57:41.600]  are having 37% of the abortion.
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:47.200]  So if that is the case, and it's already that abortion is the most performed operation
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:53.280]  on a woman, how can you not allow the information, the health information, especially when it
[02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:58.800]  comes to the issue of breast cancer, and it can be clearly seen by all data that breast
[02:57:58.800 --> 02:58:10.040]  cancer basically grows and basically skyrocketed right after Roe vs. Wade in the African American
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:11.040]  community.
[02:58:11.040 --> 02:58:20.680]  So, we're looking for a grassroots, just recently, it's been a documentary out, my offer, and
[02:58:20.680 --> 02:58:25.320]  being seen in the Selma Film Festival this Sunday.
[02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:31.000]  Absolutely, we offer it at infowars.com, the DVD film, incredibly powerful.
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:36.200]  Back in 70 seconds, Reverend, and again, I've researched all this, everything he's saying
[02:58:36.200 --> 02:58:41.640]  is documented, you need to be as informed as he is, folks, to stop this genocide.
[02:58:41.640 --> 02:58:47.640]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.640 --> 02:58:51.800]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:51.800 --> 02:58:52.800]  What's your home worth?

[02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:58.000]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:01.360]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your

[03:58:53.680 --> 03:58:57.600]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:58:57.600 --> 03:59:02.560]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[03:59:02.560 --> 03:59:06.560]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:59:06.560 --> 03:59:11.160]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:59:11.160 --> 03:59:16.480]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[03:59:16.480 --> 03:59:22.720]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:59:22.720 --> 03:59:27.080]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[03:59:27.080 --> 03:59:32.400]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:59:32.400 --> 03:59:37.640]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
