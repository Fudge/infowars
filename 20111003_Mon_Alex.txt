[08:06.680 --> 08:31.600]  network it is Monday the third day of October 2011 we knew that the
[08:31.600 --> 08:36.880]  establishment would pose as rebels they're in a key juncture and sell
[08:36.880 --> 08:45.920]  communism and socialism as the only political answer to the crony anti free
[08:45.920 --> 08:51.160]  market system we currently have today a few months ago when I stormed the
[08:51.160 --> 08:56.520]  Capitol with demonstrators against the TSA trying to kill the bill that would
[08:56.520 --> 09:03.880]  reinforce the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizure a
[09:03.880 --> 09:08.880]  gentleman walked up to me who was part of our demonstration we don't really get
[09:08.880 --> 09:13.080]  permits and then just stand outside events speaking on government provided
[09:13.080 --> 09:17.760]  loudspeakers we storm the government buildings and we go in and demand that
[09:17.760 --> 09:22.840]  our servants act in an accountable way and the police tend to grovel and back
[09:22.840 --> 09:26.800]  down and do their job and not violate the First Amendment because they don't
[09:26.800 --> 09:34.000]  want to arrest us and give us any attention I'm gonna be breaking that
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.440]  down coming up a little bit later how we've been exposing the corrupt elements
[09:39.440 --> 09:43.520]  of Wall Street at the top that are anti free market that are monopoly men for
[09:43.520 --> 09:48.120]  four years and the mainstream corporate horror media will not cover it but these
[09:48.120 --> 09:53.600]  George Soros Democratic Party run events and their their run that's now
[09:53.600 --> 10:01.080]  admitted it's getting total coverage because they're calling for higher taxes
[10:01.080 --> 10:05.320]  they're calling for an end to capitalism that means an end to you own in your own
[10:05.320 --> 10:12.560]  business all the offshore mega banks rule the country the ultra rich are for
[10:12.560 --> 10:16.280]  communism at the grassroots which is really just slavery and then they're
[10:16.280 --> 10:22.200]  exempt just like China it's the apple of the globalist crony capitalist eye but
[10:22.200 --> 10:27.080]  this guy from him he said Alex don't call it crony capitalism call it crony
[10:27.080 --> 10:33.800]  monopolism and he was absolutely right that's what it is it's just old-fashioned
[10:33.800 --> 10:38.920]  mafia criminality like Chicago you don't have a restaurant you don't have a bar
[10:38.920 --> 10:45.600]  you don't have a theater not not just only if you pay them off a lot of times
[10:45.600 --> 10:49.520]  you pay them off for a few years and finally the local corrupt system just
[10:49.520 --> 10:53.400]  opens up their own club next to you or forces you to sell to them at gunpoint
[10:53.400 --> 10:57.560]  and I've talked to big famous club owners not just Aaron Russo but others
[10:57.560 --> 11:02.680]  from Chicago the cops walk right in and say start paying me 20% right now or
[11:02.680 --> 11:07.200]  you're dead I will have my men kill you on the street we will shoot you in the
[11:07.200 --> 11:11.000]  back of the head when you're in the parking lot you understand and then
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.440]  after you've been doing that for a while they just say you know what I'm gonna
[11:13.440 --> 11:17.040]  put my guy in here managing and all the money's ours you complain your whole
[11:17.040 --> 11:27.760]  family's dead that's who runs America that's who runs America the ATF on record
[11:27.760 --> 11:32.360]  has been caught shipping 2,000 guns and one shipment alone to the Sinaloa drug
[11:32.360 --> 11:36.320]  cartel and separately in other federal court cases the feds have admitted the
[11:36.320 --> 11:40.800]  Sinaloa for five years now almost five and a half has been authorized to ship
[11:40.800 --> 11:47.240]  an unlimited pure cocaine even through US border stations and the internal
[11:47.240 --> 11:50.040]  checkpoints they're told wave the trucks through you know what happened to me
[11:50.040 --> 11:55.720]  yesterday I took the RV we got so I can drive around the country outside of the
[11:55.720 --> 12:00.480]  TSA and spark brush fires in the minds of men and women against tyranny I
[12:00.480 --> 12:06.560]  decided to test drive it down with my family and Richard Reeves was actually
[12:06.560 --> 12:10.240]  you know testing it out because it's 11 years old we got a used one got a great
[12:10.240 --> 12:18.280]  deal on it too but we've been having to do some repairs on it Richard Reeves
[12:18.280 --> 12:21.600]  drove it down to the coast with us and driving down you just drive through
[12:21.600 --> 12:26.520]  cameras and on the ground and all these lights at night but driving back up 70
[12:26.520 --> 12:30.480]  miles into the US we never left the United States we never got within six
[12:30.480 --> 12:35.560]  seven eight miles of the border down there in South Padre driving back I ran
[12:35.560 --> 12:39.480]  into the big checkpoint and they directed us into the lane where everybody
[12:39.480 --> 12:42.760]  gets searched and we've got the video I'm going to air it tonight on M4
[12:42.760 --> 12:47.920]  News just handed it to Rob do shot it yesterday afternoon about five o'clock
[12:47.920 --> 12:54.240]  going to the checkpoint traffic backed up hundreds of cars and they directed us
[12:54.240 --> 12:58.720]  in for the search and they had the drug dogs going in each car and I was up
[12:58.720 --> 13:03.240]  there in the front of the RV with the big bus front and this board patrol runs
[13:03.240 --> 13:06.560]  over and says turn your camera off and I said no it's the first amendment you're
[13:06.560 --> 13:10.880]  surveilling us and he tried to bow up and I just said do whatever you're
[13:10.880 --> 13:13.640]  gonna do you're gonna see the video tonight he said fine it's just a request
[13:13.640 --> 13:18.680]  another one runs over and says you know you might have I searched and I said no
[13:18.680 --> 13:22.000]  he goes great I will and I'm at the trick question I meant no you can't search
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.520]  and I said listen to me I know the government ships the drugs in and you're
[13:27.520 --> 13:30.160]  only here to bust cowboys and I said you're not gonna violate my fourth
[13:30.160 --> 13:34.480]  amendment and he said okay are you as citizens that's our little cover they've
[13:34.480 --> 13:38.600]  got these a hundred miles in in some areas of the country we were 70 plus
[13:38.600 --> 13:43.040]  miles in we were driving about 70 miles an hour we were about seven eight miles
[13:43.040 --> 13:45.960]  we're looking at the map right now from the Mexico border we never went into
[13:45.960 --> 13:53.960]  Mexico and we're way up the highway there's all these side roads you could
[13:53.960 --> 13:57.520]  take they're just there to search everybody and their claim is we're
[13:57.520 --> 14:00.920]  looking for illegals they let the illegals go Homeland Security is on
[14:00.920 --> 14:06.040]  record hiring illegals that they bust in fake rage and giving them green cards
[14:06.040 --> 14:10.320]  it's just all completely fake it's all for theater and they were there running
[14:10.320 --> 14:14.600]  police dogs into every single vehicle and I just said look I've had enough of
[14:14.600 --> 14:18.760]  it you know what I know you that the government brings the drugs in and the
[14:18.760 --> 14:24.560]  guy smiled and he said well I still gonna search it he came around open the
[14:24.560 --> 14:27.360]  door I said well go ahead and violate my fourth amendment but you're doing this
[14:27.360 --> 14:32.680]  against my fourth amendment and he said he backed off and also again continue to
[14:32.680 --> 14:36.440]  explain this government you know ships in the drugs and they can't deny it
[14:36.440 --> 14:40.680]  they're only I said you're only here to bust cowboys well I'm not one of them I
[14:40.680 --> 14:48.400]  don't use your boss's products and Ron Paul's right these checkpoints are for
[14:48.400 --> 14:52.080]  the American people they're not there to stop the illegal aliens you know Richard
[14:52.080 --> 14:55.080]  and I were talking about it it'd be one thing if you had this pure libertarian
[14:55.080 --> 14:58.360]  idea where all the borders were open and every other country had reciprocate
[14:58.360 --> 15:02.040]  Mexico has completely draconian laws internal checkpoints you're caught
[15:02.040 --> 15:06.320]  very legal six months to a year hard labor beat up suck the money out of you
[15:06.320 --> 15:11.440]  but that's okay but America's wide open to people driving down the wages and not
[15:11.440 --> 15:15.920]  forcing Mexico to have a true revolution the big banks been down there for
[15:15.920 --> 15:24.800]  decades financing communism as the answer to the crony fascist you know the few
[15:24.800 --> 15:31.520]  families that run Mexico when you ever turn loose the true free market of the
[15:31.520 --> 15:39.440]  Mexican people and ever I mean Mexico is one giant Chicago Mexico is one giant
[15:39.440 --> 15:43.440]  Chicago and if you're not part of the one of the big mega corporations or

[24:08.400 --> 24:12.800]  next and then I'm gonna reset and try to really take the hundreds of different
[24:12.800 --> 24:17.800]  data points and proof I have of this and present it but it's very simple the
[24:17.800 --> 24:23.040]  mega banks make most their money in big government bailouts and through their
[24:23.040 --> 24:28.200]  control the issuance of currency and credit they go out and especially with
[24:28.200 --> 24:31.480]  the socialist trained college students that are also financed by the big banks
[24:31.480 --> 24:38.280]  and indebted to them they go out and tell them rich people are the problem we
[24:38.280 --> 24:42.960]  need to have a 60% tax rate in this country and then you'll get lots of free
[24:42.960 --> 24:46.880]  goodies and of course they never get the free goodies we've watched this being
[24:46.880 --> 24:50.960]  done in third world country after third world country and now in first world
[24:50.960 --> 24:56.000]  countries now in Europe they don't even say it's for socialism they say we're
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.200]  cutting all your benefits and all the money's going to pay for derivatives the
[25:00.200 --> 25:05.480]  banks created and Cameron the British Prime Minister's in the news today
[25:05.480 --> 25:10.400]  that's coming up saying I don't care if 85% or more the British people want a
[25:10.400 --> 25:16.040]  referendum to get us out of the Euro we're staying in it the headline is
[25:16.040 --> 25:20.320]  because I think we need to be in it this is what we're talking about a global
[25:20.320 --> 25:24.840]  financial dictatorship a bank of the world that you pay carbon taxes to and
[25:24.840 --> 25:35.160]  they've got Al Gore, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Herman Cain, all of them I
[25:35.160 --> 25:41.080]  mentioned Glenn Beck all of them promoting a VAT and sales tax right now
[25:41.080 --> 25:45.200]  both of them to quote pay our debts get out of debt the 14 trillion's nothing
[25:45.200 --> 25:50.280]  27 plus trillions been given to offshore banks but the public is so ignorant
[25:50.280 --> 25:53.760]  they don't understand this conservatives are ignorant but when you get down to
[25:53.760 --> 25:58.240]  your quote average liberal these aren't liberals at all and they're running
[25:58.240 --> 26:01.240]  around saying in fact let's just play the Michael Moore before we go to him
[26:01.240 --> 26:04.720]  they're running around this is wick radowski last week talking to Michael
[26:04.720 --> 26:09.920]  Moore and he says the problem isn't the Federal Reserve the problem is
[26:09.920 --> 26:16.960]  capitalism we need to go after capitalism just this general the tens of
[26:16.960 --> 26:20.160]  thousands of companies traded in the stock exchange they're all evil anybody
[26:20.160 --> 26:25.000]  who's into free market they're bad this is what Warren Buffett and all of them
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.200]  put out people that get banker bailout money they want more tax money it's
[26:30.200 --> 26:37.480]  called austerity in Europe in Greece here pay to them it's so elementary it's so
[26:37.480 --> 26:41.320]  elementary let's play the club Michael what do you think about ending the
[26:41.320 --> 26:45.720]  Federal Reserve banking system the private banking system I think there's a
[26:45.720 --> 26:51.520]  larger it's there's a larger issue to deal with and capitalism that's the
[26:51.520 --> 26:59.000]  problem capitalism capitalism has to go capitalism has to go okay folks have
[26:59.000 --> 27:06.200]  you seen Soviet Russia have you seen Chinese China communist Chinese China
[27:06.200 --> 27:13.560]  have you seen what the communists have done to the Chinese people I mean where
[27:13.560 --> 27:17.080]  it's a handful of generals and a few million interparty members that rule
[27:17.080 --> 27:22.840]  everybody kill political dissidents and take their organs do you have any idea
[27:22.840 --> 27:28.200]  what collectivism like I mean you have no freedom and now this notice now we're
[27:28.200 --> 27:32.280]  going into collectivism the big banks are funding the carbon taxes they're
[27:32.280 --> 27:35.360]  funding the fake environmental groups they're funding the takeover in
[27:35.360 --> 27:39.200]  federalization or local school the federalization your police teaching you
[27:39.200 --> 27:42.480]  collectivism because if they can't get you in debt they're just not going to let
[27:42.480 --> 27:46.360]  you have a business they're gonna raise the taxes so high to where only they
[27:46.360 --> 27:50.760]  can operate and they're exempt this is bondage and I'm gonna go to Paul right
[27:50.760 --> 27:56.760]  now but I want you to listen to me this country the bankers are trying to put us
[27:56.760 --> 28:03.200]  into communism not just socialism we're already pretty much socialist already
[28:03.200 --> 28:06.720]  more than half of the general public's money is paid in taxes and half the
[28:06.720 --> 28:12.520]  public pays no federal taxes we've already got 50 million people on food
[28:12.520 --> 28:15.960]  stamps our journey to slavery is already there they're now shutting the
[28:15.960 --> 28:20.600]  economy off post-industrial world and taking a giant hoard of welfare people
[28:20.600 --> 28:24.000]  and folks with government jobs who don't know why their paycheck doesn't buy
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.400]  them what what it used to they don't know about the Federal Reserve devaluing
[28:28.400 --> 28:32.320]  the dollar they don't know about geopolitical movements they don't know
[28:32.320 --> 28:37.320]  what austerity is they don't know what banker dictatorship is all they know is
[28:37.320 --> 28:41.360]  the mainstream media is telling them vote for higher taxes the rich people are
[28:41.360 --> 28:46.600]  exempt well yeah because the rich people wrote the rules and they became rich by
[28:46.600 --> 28:49.800]  running government-controlled monopolies and also have we're going to bring
[28:49.800 --> 28:54.080]  come back to Watson I also get these emails constantly saying poor Alex
[28:54.080 --> 28:57.480]  doesn't understand that communism socialism and fascism are different
[28:57.480 --> 29:01.320]  things really you mean the last hundred and ten years you've been taught this
[29:01.320 --> 29:05.400]  false political paradigm I happen to have read tragedy and hope by Carol
[29:05.400 --> 29:08.000]  quickly I happen to have read men in power as a political retrospective by
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.320]  German Chancellor Elma Schmidt I happen to have read hundreds and hundreds of
[29:11.320 --> 29:14.040]  publications and books written by them and they openly when they're
[29:14.040 --> 29:17.440]  communicating with each other explain they're into command and control
[29:17.440 --> 29:21.840]  tyranny I'm into liberty that's the real polar opposite not liberal and
[29:21.840 --> 29:28.240]  conservative they always seek to create socialism and communism at the grass
[29:28.240 --> 29:34.640]  roots to get you dependent socialism leading into communism while they are
[29:34.640 --> 29:41.400]  exempt and offshore and transfer your wealth to them they're exempt they're
[29:41.400 --> 29:46.960]  tax-free tax-free foundations the ultra rich always finance the communist you
[29:46.960 --> 29:52.560]  are bank or run Wall Street created we're on the March the empires on the

[30:15.040 --> 30:19.800]  minister influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[30:19.800 --> 30:24.920]  shards I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay

[35:39.720 --> 35:43.760]  the clips over and over again of Glenn Beck on the Bill O'Reilly's Bill O'Reilly
[35:43.760 --> 35:48.120]  saying I think we need a national sales tax and Glenn Beck's like I agree with
[35:48.120 --> 35:53.800]  you but I think we need both VAT and sales they got Herman Cain former head
[35:53.800 --> 35:57.120]  of the Federal Reserve at Kansas City running around saying the Federal
[35:57.120 --> 36:02.280]  Reserve is your friend and Ron Paul's a nut

[36:24.200 --> 36:30.800]  like we want higher taxes and Obama to be elected well sure enough they're Paul
[36:30.800 --> 36:35.120]  Watson joins us Obama machine prepares to hijack Occupy Wall Street yeah well
[36:35.120 --> 36:38.600]  you don't really hijack something you kicked off they know when there's about
[36:38.600 --> 36:41.480]  to be a rebellion they know when folks are waking up the Federal Reserve comes
[36:41.480 --> 36:46.160]  out last week and says they're surveilling all their opposition they're
[36:46.160 --> 36:50.840]  watching all their opposition they're tracking all their opposition that's the
[36:50.840 --> 36:55.960]  real enemy not capitalism not the free market it's big megabanks that are
[36:55.960 --> 36:59.440]  exempt from taxes and issue the currency and credit that write the federal
[36:59.440 --> 37:03.240]  regulations that have their people in every power position who's stolen 27
[37:03.240 --> 37:06.840]  trillion in bailout money and we've got all these college students who can't get
[37:06.840 --> 37:10.560]  jobs can't pay off their college globalism NAFTA GATT has destroyed them
[37:10.560 --> 37:14.840]  that both parties pushed through to move everything to China and we're going to a
[37:14.840 --> 37:18.760]  Chinese model where it's socialism and communism mixed together at the bottom
[37:18.760 --> 37:21.880]  where we're all dependent on the state and they've got bureaucrats over us and
[37:21.880 --> 37:26.800]  then the elites sit back in or above the law or General Electric can operate as
[37:26.800 --> 37:30.760]  power plants but nobody else can where if you're a donor to the inner party you
[37:30.760 --> 37:36.520]  can keep your GM dealership but if you aren't you can't or you can get tens of
[37:36.520 --> 37:39.320]  billions of dollars in green energy credits and never even build a thing
[37:39.320 --> 37:45.520]  and openly dance around and say it's a post industrial America haha if you're
[37:45.520 --> 37:49.200]  not part of the club you're not operating a business this is mafia
[37:49.200 --> 37:55.440]  government and they've got a bunch of well-meaning surely college kids who
[37:55.440 --> 37:58.440]  make me want to throw up with their ignorance but so do the mainline
[37:58.440 --> 38:01.840]  Republicans running around telling me how Rush Limbong Limbeck are going to save
[38:01.840 --> 38:05.040]  them you know Paul's written a lot of articles on this I've played the clips I
[38:05.040 --> 38:08.320]  could play you probably an hour straight at Glenn Beck and and others
[38:08.320 --> 38:15.560]  promoting sales taxes and VAT to pay off what this country owes we don't owe
[38:15.560 --> 38:20.000]  this stinking money we're an engine of success our supposed debt the bankers
[38:20.000 --> 38:26.720]  have manipulated us into is 14 trillion we gave the stinking bankers 16.6
[38:26.720 --> 38:37.440]  secret and another 11 or so that they want that that's public 27 27 trillion
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.720]  we haven't got numbers in two years and these idiots are in the streets saying
[38:41.720 --> 38:46.920]  get the rich people the ultra mega world rulers literally have your tax money
[38:46.920 --> 38:51.480]  paid to them you idiot they hold the whole world hostage they've screwed
[38:51.480 --> 38:54.680]  everything over they're working with collectivist in China and everywhere
[38:54.680 --> 39:00.120]  else and you're sitting there saying put more cyanide in the water I'm gonna go
[39:00.120 --> 39:04.600]  to Paul Watson has broken this down but I'll tell you this they're bringing a
[39:04.600 --> 39:09.560]  mixture of communist socialist system to America backed up with a police state
[39:09.560 --> 39:13.400]  grid conservatives will give up their rights in the name of fight and terror
[39:13.400 --> 39:17.480]  liberals will give it up in the name of socialism and that's what the CFR head
[39:17.480 --> 39:22.080]  wrote years ago Paul you ought to republish that stuff where where Richard
[39:22.080 --> 39:26.680]  in Haas talks about it they got it all figured out and right when they know
[39:26.680 --> 39:29.640]  we're waking up to Wall Street and the incredible inequity they say Wall
[39:29.640 --> 39:33.360]  Street says okay raise taxes on us they've all these rich guys go I'm exempt
[39:33.360 --> 39:37.680]  from taxes that's not right well you know what I'm not exempt from taxes you
[39:37.680 --> 39:41.080]  make a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year when you talk about all
[39:41.080 --> 39:47.000]  the all the different write-offs they've gotten rid of it's 45% Boba Jack that I
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.120]  pay that's not counting all the other taxes trying to run this operation
[39:52.120 --> 39:57.920]  anybody who's had a business knows that except the globalist who are exempt now
[39:57.920 --> 40:01.760]  I'm gonna go to Paul Watson now to break this down Paul I took two weeks to
[40:01.760 --> 40:05.680]  analyze this to watch it I knew Soros was involved but I still knew in the Fed
[40:05.680 --> 40:08.120]  was trying to get in there we were trying to point out the real problem
[40:08.120 --> 40:11.880]  I've confirmed now that anybody talking about liberty or wearing an Obama Joker
[40:11.880 --> 40:17.480]  shirt is told hit the hit the door hit the bricks buddy hit the street they're
[40:17.480 --> 40:23.160]  now chop rich people's heads off in capitalism there is no doubt this is
[40:23.160 --> 40:28.240]  banker financed French Revolution this is not 1776 this is the opposite my
[40:28.240 --> 40:31.920]  friend and we and that's why I'm making the big announcement and it folks if you

[41:06.160 --> 41:11.920]  government this is the problem Paul Watson I'm telling you that it really hit
[41:11.920 --> 41:15.080]  me this is yet but when it really happens you're you're dumbfounded for a
[41:15.080 --> 41:19.320]  moment this is the bankers trying to trigger like judo and use all the anger
[41:19.320 --> 41:23.120]  we're throwing at them and turn it around and bring in total collectivism to
[41:23.120 --> 41:26.760]  fully wipe out their competition and fully get us dependent I mean they're
[41:26.760 --> 41:30.520]  making their big move worldwide revolution the mainstream or media is
[41:30.520 --> 41:35.240]  calling this American Revolution they're dubbing it saying it's great that's
[41:35.240 --> 41:40.320]  your big telltale sign what demonizing in the Fed and second secret police on
[41:40.320 --> 41:48.520]  us I mean it's on Watson it's on well Alex the big dirty secret behind this
[41:48.520 --> 41:53.240]  Occupy Wall Street event which is not to say that there are a lot of well-meaning
[41:53.240 --> 41:57.680]  people involved in it but once again they've been conned is the fact that the
[41:57.680 --> 42:02.080]  Occupy Wall Street tax proposal the one that they're all out in the street
[42:02.080 --> 42:08.160]  advocating is backed by Wall Street itself and you can go on the Occupy
[42:08.160 --> 42:12.880]  Wall Street official website what they're calling the official website and one
[42:12.880 --> 42:16.960]  of their demands is for the Obama administration through Congress to quote
[42:16.960 --> 42:23.360]  pass the Buffett rule on fair taxation so the rich pay their fair share and that
[42:23.360 --> 42:29.040]  demand is posted on their own website the only problem with that is the Buffett
[42:29.040 --> 42:35.000]  tax rule is the one that the Obama administration itself bought and paid
[42:35.000 --> 42:40.840]  for by Wall Street 2008 Obama campaign Goldman Sachs over a million dollars
[42:40.840 --> 42:45.840]  donation JP Morgan over eight hundred thousand dollars again in 2012 the
[42:45.840 --> 42:50.120]  bombers campaign is even more reliant on Wall Street funding of course his
[42:50.120 --> 42:55.000]  entire cabinet is made up largely of people who made their living made their
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  reputation on the back of Wall Street the Obama administration completely
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.640]  Wall Street owned and what do we read out of Bloomberg news just a couple of
[43:03.640 --> 43:08.800]  days ago quote no differences exist between the Obama administration and
[43:08.800 --> 43:12.920]  billionaire investor Warren Buffett on the principles of a White House tax
[43:12.920 --> 43:17.880]  proposal that bears his name Jay Carney president President Barack Obama's
[43:17.880 --> 43:23.360]  spokesman told Bloomberg just a couple of days ago so we've got this so-called
[43:23.360 --> 43:27.600]  fair tax proposal being promoted by Warren Buffett and the Obama
[43:27.600 --> 43:33.560]  administration which is completely bought and paid for by Wall Street so why is it
[43:33.560 --> 43:39.520]  also being advocated by so-called anti Wall Street protesters well that's the
[43:39.520 --> 43:47.480]  incredible brazenness of the Hutzpah or just the bravada the the hubris where
[43:47.480 --> 43:52.360]  the mega banks the same ones that have hijacked the US are openly in Europe
[43:52.360 --> 43:56.760]  saying democracy's wrong in Germany we're gonna get rid of even more of the
[43:56.760 --> 44:00.560]  pension funds that the Germans have been forced to pay into we're gonna slash
[44:00.560 --> 44:06.240]  the social safety net which they paid into socialism they took their money
[44:06.240 --> 44:11.640]  and it's got all go to the bankers to quote prop up the too big to fail you've
[44:11.640 --> 44:16.720]  got to pull up the BBC remember six months ago Paul where it was a headline
[44:16.720 --> 44:21.120]  head of ira central bank says it's good Ireland now run by foreign banks and
[44:21.120 --> 44:25.520]  they went overnight from being the fastest growing best position lowest
[44:25.520 --> 44:29.320]  debt to just oh you signed on to the euro your banker up now you just signed
[44:29.320 --> 44:34.280]  on to our derivatives I mean is Iceland is the only country to effectively beat
[44:34.280 --> 44:38.600]  it so far in the fight still on I saw in the news today the Icelanders figured
[44:38.600 --> 44:43.280]  it out and said this debt is in ours and forced an audit and found out that 92
[44:43.280 --> 44:48.320]  percent wasn't their debt and they said go ahead and sue us British crown go
[44:48.320 --> 44:52.600]  ahead and sue us Bank of England go ahead and sue us EU your bankers owe this
[44:52.600 --> 44:56.200]  money we're gonna arrest the banker heads the finance minister and the finance
[44:56.200 --> 45:01.320]  minister left the country it's same thing 90 plus percent of the Irish the
[45:01.320 --> 45:05.520]  money's not owed by them or the government 90 plus percent here 90 plus
[45:05.520 --> 45:10.920]  percent it's the same actuary and it's so naked that they're on I mean when you
[45:10.920 --> 45:14.960]  see ABC News Time Magazine Newsweek Warren Buffett on every channel every week
[45:14.960 --> 45:19.560]  saying it's not right that I don't pay any taxes we need to pass my rule that
[45:19.560 --> 45:23.880]  raises it on people making 125,000 a year and then these hippies send me emails
[45:23.880 --> 45:27.920]  going if you think middle class is 125,000 you're crazy we do need to take
[45:27.920 --> 45:32.000]  their money you idiots you could take all the domestic rich people's money in
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.840]  the US it would amount to two trillion dollars they wouldn't run the country for
[45:36.840 --> 45:40.480]  one stinking year and then all the wealth's gone the people that come to your
[45:40.480 --> 45:44.600]  hotels that go to your restaurants to go to your golf courses that that that get
[45:44.600 --> 45:49.560]  their nails done I mean you don't understand the globalist do they want a
[45:49.560 --> 45:55.640]  post industrial post consumerist world is the consumer thing wrong is it gone
[45:55.640 --> 45:59.480]  too far yeah but that's not freedom that's just people getting decadent on
[45:59.480 --> 46:03.500]  the cheap credit of the beginning of the Ponzi scheme 12 years ago when they
[46:03.500 --> 46:07.280]  sucked us into it and the globalist using Madison Avenue to get us to sell
[46:07.280 --> 46:11.840]  out for bobbles but then it isn't like communism is some new wonderful thing
[46:11.840 --> 46:16.760]  we need to get back to self-sufficiency local sustainability true free market
[46:16.760 --> 46:21.920]  true decision-making and you notice under Obama rating the Amish rating people
[46:21.920 --> 46:26.920]  selling tomatoes rating people with gardens it's on a Jenna 21 global
[46:26.920 --> 46:32.840]  corporate domination shutting down farms and ranches I mean Paul the magnitude
[46:32.840 --> 46:37.520]  and I'm an idiot you know two weeks ago I knew Soros was involved I went and
[46:37.520 --> 46:40.640]  looked it up I watched the groups leading it with their Democrat mindless
[46:40.640 --> 46:45.800]  chance of the vapid eyes like it's time to take the money from the rich behead
[46:45.800 --> 46:49.640]  them the one percenters I knew but I knew in the Fed was there trying to vie
[46:49.640 --> 46:53.680]  and hey it's the fellow reserve it's not capitalism it's bad but you watch
[46:53.680 --> 46:59.120]  CNN MSNBC Paul it's all capitalism did this capitalism did this capitalism
[46:59.120 --> 47:04.120]  no we got away from capitalism more and more in 1913 we have a mega private
[47:04.120 --> 47:08.440]  central bank running things it's in control it's robbing and looting
[47:08.440 --> 47:12.240]  everything openly I mean the Federal Reserve what was six months ago came
[47:12.240 --> 47:16.760]  out and said the CFR came out and recommended a VAT and a sales tax and
[47:16.760 --> 47:21.680]  a carbon tax to pay our debt to them and then they got a gaggle of idiots in the
[47:21.680 --> 47:26.600]  streets and then they said me emails lecturing me how I work for Wall Street
[47:26.600 --> 47:32.880]  I don't own one stinking stock I don't have any Wall Street sponsors I'm a
[47:32.880 --> 47:36.800]  hundred percent sponsored by my listeners I'm against tyranny I'm against
[47:36.800 --> 47:43.320]  unfair monopoly groups mafia is running our world and you stupid stupid so-called
[47:43.320 --> 47:48.400]  liberals make me want to throw up your your insane ignorance and you moron
[47:48.400 --> 47:53.320]  mainline Republicans you make me want to vomit on you as well when all of your
[47:53.320 --> 47:58.200]  chief whores all of them every stinking one of them's pushing new taxes to pay
[47:58.200 --> 48:02.280]  off what we owe and I'm sorry Paul but you've got all the links in your
[48:02.280 --> 48:06.920]  articles where the whole thing is the Warren Buffett Bill Gates Bill Gates's
[48:06.920 --> 48:12.520]  dad is in this one percent movie a film by Jamie Johnson with a rich kid comes
[48:12.520 --> 48:16.360]  out against the corruption of the elite and he blames free market for it no
[48:16.360 --> 48:20.680]  most these families made their money in sweetheart deals with government contracts
[48:20.680 --> 48:26.040]  with my tax money this isn't some defector from the ultra rich this is a
[48:26.040 --> 48:31.560]  top-level ultra rich person doing what granddaddy did learning how to con the
[48:31.560 --> 48:35.960]  general public into into into going into the rats nest thinking they're getting
[48:35.960 --> 48:43.760]  out of it go ahead Paul here's a quote Alex from the Wall Street Journal quote
[48:43.760 --> 48:50.400]  roughly 90% of the tax filers who would pay more under mr. Obama's plan this is
[48:50.400 --> 48:55.240]  the plan being advocated by Occupy Wall Street and Warren Buffett on millionaires
[48:55.240 --> 49:02.600]  and 99.99% on billionaires so again it's the middle class it's not Warren Buffett
[49:02.600 --> 49:06.400]  or Wall Street corporations that are going to be hurt most by this Occupy
[49:06.400 --> 49:12.400]  Wall Street solution that they're calling for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
[49:12.400 --> 49:16.840]  still owes taxes from 10 years ago you know he's the ultimate Wall Street
[49:16.840 --> 49:21.520]  insider third richest man on the planet Buffett and most of the top corporations
[49:21.520 --> 49:25.840]  pay virtually no income tax not because of some law that hasn't passed that's
[49:25.840 --> 49:30.840]  going to decimate the middle class but because they park their wealth in
[49:30.840 --> 49:35.520]  offshore tax havens that's why they get to avoid the income tax so all this crap
[49:35.520 --> 49:41.680]  about 1% is absolute nonsense this is going to decimate the middle class and
[49:41.680 --> 49:47.400]  that's his own Wells Fargo caught laundering 376 billion in narcotics
[49:47.400 --> 49:52.640]  money in two years alone they paid a $111 million dollar $111 million
[49:52.640 --> 49:57.200]  dollar fine on it that was something like 0.3% like you rob a bank you pay a
[49:57.200 --> 50:04.440]  $3,000 fine it is completely asinine and Paul we are going up against the Federal
[50:04.440 --> 50:07.960]  Reserve we're actually going up against a group who came out last week and said
[50:07.960 --> 50:12.320]  they're surveilling the American people we're actually going up against a group
[50:12.320 --> 50:16.200]  that is completely ruthless and actually hijacked this nation and killed
[50:16.200 --> 50:20.120]  Kennedy when he tried to stop him if people want to go out the real corporate
[50:20.120 --> 50:25.800]  fascist the monopoly man this is it Paul this is it and we're going straight
[50:25.800 --> 50:28.760]  into the belly of the beast and it's time to have an occupy the Federal Reserve
[50:28.760 --> 50:32.760]  what do you think of that well we're not just cynically dismissing all the
[50:32.760 --> 50:36.680]  occupy Wall Street people and saying oh let's just do nothing we're offering a
[50:36.680 --> 50:42.280]  real alternative solution that actually targets the focus of the problem I mean
[50:42.280 --> 50:45.800]  we had people back in August with the London riots saying we were bad for not
[50:45.800 --> 50:49.440]  supporting a group of folks you know stealing trainers from JD's and that's
[50:49.440 --> 50:53.560]  meant to make protesters look bad stay there absolutely the global bankers

[53:52.840 --> 54:07.400]  like crazy.com or call 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 now I want to be clear
[54:07.400 --> 54:16.760]  here if you want to put a Tobin tax on the big mega brokerage firms and the
[54:16.760 --> 54:20.680]  Federal Reserve I'd all be for it to pay off the debt of course you just be paying
[54:20.680 --> 54:24.720]  the money right back to them it's fraudulent you got to write it off and
[54:24.720 --> 54:29.080]  I want to be clear there are a lot of good people in this Occupy Wall Street
[54:29.080 --> 54:33.760]  movement but the move on George Soros they all admit they're trying to hijack it
[54:33.760 --> 54:38.320]  because they know they've got to lead the opposition George Soros gets banker
[54:38.320 --> 54:43.400]  bailout money he brags about having a great crisis Europe is going under serious
[54:43.400 --> 54:47.640]  austerity I'm not one of these fake right-wingers that supports the banksters
[54:47.640 --> 54:52.360]  saying cut everybody's pensions and things that you've paid into to pay the
[54:52.360 --> 54:57.080]  bankers see the mainline Republicans are saying that with austerity they get
[54:57.080 --> 55:00.760]  one half and the Democrats calling and say raise tax on the middle class and
[55:00.760 --> 55:06.880]  in between them was it Jack Spratt could eat no fat and his wife could eat no
[55:06.880 --> 55:11.840]  lean so between the two of them they lick the platter clean that's how this
[55:11.840 --> 55:16.320]  dialectic works take Roseanne Barr I've read about her I know she's involved in
[55:16.320 --> 55:20.720]  a lot of good causes not a bad person I was planning to play a clip of her I
[55:20.720 --> 55:25.040]  know Max Kaiser had her on and I understand what she's saying either the
[55:25.040 --> 55:28.400]  rich start paying some more taxes or they get their heads chopped off but are
[55:28.400 --> 55:31.920]  you talking about the guy that it makes a million bucks a year and has 300
[55:31.920 --> 55:36.760]  employees down the road at the cement factory or whatever that he started when
[55:36.760 --> 55:42.520]  he was 25 years old with one truck I had to know a guy like that and literally
[55:42.520 --> 55:45.120]  worked his fingers to the bone doesn't even have fingerprints because the lime
[55:45.120 --> 55:50.800]  ate them off come out that guy with hundreds of employees or are you talking
[55:50.800 --> 55:55.320]  about Warren Buffett who got banker bailout money by the way there are
[55:55.320 --> 55:58.680]  demonstrations against Bank of America against the corrupt mortgages now
[55:58.680 --> 56:04.120]  that's I support that so I need to be clear there's a lot of good stuff
[56:04.120 --> 56:09.160]  happening here and when Bank of America takes people's houses that are paid for
[56:09.160 --> 56:14.320]  they don't even have a deed to like in Florida they do deserve to go to prison
[56:14.320 --> 56:20.560]  but I don't want to start talking about cutting heads off but I understand where
[56:20.560 --> 56:23.640]  Roseanne Barr is going with this but the elite want to cut the middle classes
[56:23.640 --> 56:28.800]  head off instead of actually they're gonna throw the system of the wolves
[56:28.800 --> 56:32.320]  because they want to get rid of what's left of the free market Paul you've got
[56:32.320 --> 56:34.800]  the floor in the last few minutes of this the next five minutes and we're
[56:34.800 --> 56:39.000]  gonna get a report from Rob Jacobson there on the streets in New York I flew
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.360]  him up there and with another reporter here out of our office and then we also
[56:43.360 --> 56:47.720]  have Darren McBrain's gonna be down there covering the Occupy Austin at the
[56:47.720 --> 56:51.880]  city council that'll all be staged with their people down there this Thursday
[56:51.880 --> 56:56.240]  and we've also got other reporters and I and I'm going to Dallas in Houston in
[56:56.240 --> 57:01.040]  San Antonio but you finish up the next few minutes you've got so many quotes
[57:01.040 --> 57:04.960]  so much proof and I'm just so tired of seeing well-meaning people getting conned
[57:04.960 --> 57:10.480]  by this Paul well I mean the words that John Lennon sung when he said in the
[57:10.480 --> 57:14.120]  song Revolution you know you say you want a revolution but then you go
[57:14.120 --> 57:18.080]  carrying pictures of Chairman Mao well if you listen to some of the interviews
[57:18.080 --> 57:21.280]  and we're not saying this is all the people but it's it's definitely a
[57:21.280 --> 57:25.480]  significant portion you go watch the Kokesh interview that was posted in the
[57:25.480 --> 57:29.320]  article yesterday and you look at some of the signs these people are carrying
[57:29.320 --> 57:34.640]  the red flags are communist motifs then alarm bells start ringing because they
[57:34.640 --> 57:40.200]  talk about using the state to violently enforce their belief system which if
[57:40.200 --> 57:45.880]  you read the Occupy Wall Street website is the Obama agenda that's why in these
[57:45.880 --> 57:51.240]  interviews they want to re-elect Obama who is the ultimate Wall Street puppet
[57:51.240 --> 57:55.320]  they openly advocate his tax agenda as we've just talked about and then you
[57:55.320 --> 57:59.240]  look at who is actually coming in to steer the protests and it's move on
[57:59.240 --> 58:04.520]  org which is a democratic party front massive backer of Obama bankroll these
[58:04.520 --> 58:09.960]  2008 campaign fully behind him in 2012 and of course that campaign was funded
[58:09.960 --> 58:14.960]  by JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs his entire cabinet is full of Wall Street
[58:14.960 --> 58:19.800]  operative Lauren Summers Caldera Michael Froman so why is a group that help get
[58:19.800 --> 58:24.040]  Wall Street insiders to power now announcing its involvement in anti
[58:24.040 --> 58:28.320]  Wall Street protesters it doesn't make any sense whatsoever unless these
[58:28.320 --> 58:32.520]  protests are being manipulated stay there we'll come back with a more intel
[58:32.520 --> 58:38.040]  from Paul Watson it's simple they implode America poses the saviors and then
[58:38.040 --> 58:40.880]  fully destroy America

[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:46.960]  well specifically do you disagree with me on this Occupy Wall Street I don't know
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:52.600]  how you could but if you do like to hear from you if you agree and how do we
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:56.080]  reach out to these well-meaning people who really think communism and
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.720]  socialism is a good thing my god it killed a couple hundred million people
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:04.600]  last century the total humiliation a bunch of government party members living
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:08.680]  in palaces while everything we've worked for gets stolen from us it's always
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:13.120]  big banks funding it my god they're trying to hear we've got to defeat these
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.920]  globalists I mean we've got to get them out of power and punish them because
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:22.280]  they're not gonna stop do you think I want to go up and protest the Fed you
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.800]  think I like it you notice I don't go out in public a lot because I like just
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.240]  electronically working getting the word out
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.560]  you think I like going up against the Federal Reserve but it's a dark misty
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:40.080]  staircase I've got to go up into the room with the with the Cyclops folks I've
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:43.600]  got to go up they've got to follow this path because every time I look at my
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:47.360]  children and look at anybody else's children I realize they've got to have
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.000]  people to defend them they got to have people that'll do the research they've
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.240]  got to have strong minds that aren't weak-minded and as men we've got to step
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:02.800]  up but we are fighting pure unmitigated deceptive evil you think the bankers
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.840]  are just gonna come in and steal everything and then just sit there no
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.640]  they're gonna come in and run the opposition and go I know how to defeat
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:12.080]  the bankers raise taxes on the general public and pay it to us who were exempt
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:16.240]  and then they publicly run it and then I publicly can't get the little hippies
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.240]  to wake up I can't get the glenbeck people or us limbaugh people to wake up
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:24.560]  either they just love being conned
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.400]  limbaugh just says all of Wall Street's perfect bailouts are wonderful same
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:39.080]  thing with glenbeck no that's wrong that's communism for them it's stealing all
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:42.400]  you so-called conservatives that won't wake up you're gonna allow this to come
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.840]  down in America they're gonna kill a bunch of us man they're gonna steal
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.520]  everything you better get aware of that these people this this is a red terror
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:54.240]  the globalist want in this country they want to knock out America they want
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.120]  death camps they've been setting it up with Homeland Security they want to
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.240]  bring in a hot terror a red terror in this country and then they'll knock the
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.840]  commies out after they're done killing you know 50 million people and then put
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:09.200]  in some new fascist system commies are used to exterminate and relay the land
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.240]  then they bring in the corporate reform after with the public that's learned you
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:18.760]  know how to behave Paul Watson finish up I'm sorry I'm ranting here well I mean
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.440]  you played the clip earlier Alex of Michael Moore you know saying the feds
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:27.240]  are relevant and all the Occupy Wall Street people cheering why are the ideologues
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:32.280]  of this movement people like Michael Moore this is a multi-millionaire who
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:36.360]  poses as this working-class hero you know a big fat slug who tells everyone
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:41.440]  he's worth hundreds of millions and now he's trying to control the narrative of
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.320]  this Occupy Wall Street movement by claiming it's about core ending capital
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:51.320]  the guy's CIA you could take one look at him he's Ford Foundation jacked up he is
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:56.120]  a slug who knows full well what he's doing the man is a trader well I mean he
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.000]  seems to be enjoying capitalism quite a bit he owns several million dollar beach
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.920]  houses charges fifty thousand dollars to give speeches has hissy fits when he's
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.040]  not treated like royalty then puts on this fake public persona of being the

[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.920]  campaigns for Obama Obama is the most pure Wall Street candidate we've ever
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.760]  seen McCain was horrible but the point is Obama was their man his whole thing is
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.840]  run by the Federal Reserve the Federal Reserve is absorbing most of Wall
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:30.800]  Street that isn't part of the insider club the SEC shuts down all of their
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:34.520]  competition they're above the law they can wander all the drug money they want
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:39.480]  the big six banks Warren Buffett gets caught laundering 376 million blue
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:46.760]  burger ported gets in no trouble and then and then and then lectures us on every
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.000]  news program I turn on without even looking and I watch very little TV he
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.240]  must be on every day every time in a hotel room in a restaurant listening to
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.680]  the news it's him lecturing how the rich pay basically no taxes and they
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:01.600]  advertise G pays no taxes they run the President's Economic Council because
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:05.880]  they wrote the stinking rules they're exempt if some guy worth five million
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:09.640]  dollars you see it in the news tries to go do one of those tax shelters he gets
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:13.800]  arrested even though it's not illegal just like they have checkpoints all
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.520]  over the country looking for drugs but the but the ATF allows the Sinaloa
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:23.520]  cartel to bring in it was something like hundreds of times over five years it's
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.560]  to shut down their competition and and and the spectacle that I've seen on the
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.040]  news which the media is giving the attention to they're given almost no
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:36.160]  attention to people occupying bag of America pointing out they take houses
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.760]  where they don't have the mortgage on or that it's all fraudulent that's good
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:45.040]  no they ignore all the in the Fed protests coming on for four years and
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:48.360]  that are current currently going on in Denver I found out they're going on in
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:53.880]  Denver they're going on in Boston but it's only on local news things or on
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:59.600]  local news sites or on YouTube it's nowhere in the mainstream media now
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:07.360]  again why why why because we're protesting the real power structure and

[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:07.240]  the government's in debt to them through fraud we're going directly to the
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.840]  crony monopoly men they're not even crony capital set that terms not even
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:16.760]  proper these are nothing to do with capitalism it's a mafia that's exempt
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:20.280]  it controls the issuance of currency and credit that now finances through
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:24.160]  George Soros and Warren Buffett groups running around calling to raise taxes
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:30.840]  VAT sales taxes on everybody to pay quote off the debt to the bankers we've
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.360]  got to get this out to the public well a lot of people are awake drudge report
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.760]  yesterday the biggest link you can have on the internet we're gonna show this
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.200]  later we have a screenshot of it the biggest link you can have on the
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:45.880]  internet is the big giant top banner you know all the way across the page there
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:50.440]  it is protesters call for reelection of Obama drudge report that was last night
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:54.840]  until about 7 a.m. this morning I asked my web guys got about a million extra
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:59.320]  visitors not not hits a million extra visitors off that to now move down to
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:03.320]  the third story in the middle column and and and that's a big deal because that
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:06.960]  article exposes the left-right paradigm the whole deal how it works it's got
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.480]  updates on it occupy wall street tax proposal is backed by wall street itself
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:14.880]  make sure you add that as an update number two Paul your article aren't you
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.920]  glad I called you Sunday morning and said you got to get the article out you
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:23.760]  got to send it to drudge I called Paul at 7 a.m. Sunday morning and he got on it
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.000]  he got it done and that is the biggest thing in the internet you can get is the
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.920]  mega supreme Godzilla link thank you drudge for being a true patriot helping
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:35.200]  us fight the globalist and shattering a left-right paradigm because drudge knows
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:40.600]  we have no future if we don't do this Paul I'm gonna go to Jacobson who's on
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:46.520]  the ground in New York you've got a few minutes recap what we're facing here well
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:51.480]  if you read the article that was on drudge it points out how currently the
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:56.240]  narrative is being steered by these big leftist foundations who were in bed with
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.360]  wall street for example I mean there's a sign that somebody's carrying around
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:05.160]  there says quote a government is an entity which holds them monopolistic
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:10.240]  right to initiate force now does that sound like a grassroots bottom-up
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.280]  revolution or does it sound like top-down tyranny that's the kind of
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:19.880]  narrative that's now being created and move on org the big foundation that
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:24.520]  backs finances Obama the Wall Street puppet has now announced its intention
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:29.200]  to completely steer and hijack these protests starting this week so that's
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:33.240]  what your Fed and the Fed protest is all about it's about taking back the
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:38.080]  narrative and steering it towards protesting the real financial terrorists
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.600]  like as you mentioned with the banks the mortgages and of course the Federal
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.480]  Reserve so that's what it's all about it's not about people like Michael Moore
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:49.520]  and ending capitalism that's a diversion that's only going to enslave the
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:54.400]  middle class to a greater degree and as my article documents Buffett Bill Gates
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.240]  all these top corporations that pay virtually no tax all their wealth is
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.360]  offshore they will not be subject to this so-called fair tax rule that these
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:08.280]  occupy Wall Street activists trying to get through it applied 90% of the
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.840]  people who will have to go through it are not even millionaires they're just
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.600]  middle-class business owners and people who are trying to make a living that's
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.680]  who's going to get hit by this Paul you live in England tell folks what
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:28.520]  percentage in with all the taxes added that you pay the VAT was 17.5% value
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:33.600]  added tax that goes on to almost every purchase it went up to 20% few years ago
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.360]  so you pay 20% extra in petrol everything basically aside from clothing you
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.800]  pay it on food and of course the income tax which in Europe is some of the
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:48.000]  highest ever the income tax in the at the moment in Britain is 50% for
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.040]  everything you earn over I believe it's 60,000 pounds so you're gonna get you're
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.480]  not gonna get a sales tax and then they're gonna remove the income tax you
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.400]  get to get both that's exactly what happened in Europe and then they're
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.000]  just gonna keep increasing it after that and I told folks for 15 years that
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.640]  was coming and now I have to hear boards and others backpedaling as Herman
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:15.280]  Kane supports all three taxes I tell you there's no end to their evil and it's
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:20.480]  again it's just about trying to get through to these leftists whose control
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:25.840]  in their message because move on dog supports Obama who is a creature of
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:31.600]  Wall Street his entire cabinet is Wall Street is 2012 campaign is Wall Street
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.080]  so why are they backing his reelection it makes no sense unless they've been
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:41.320]  completely subverted and deluded by these big foundations that are in bed
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:44.240]  with Wall Street and a part of the global elite and it all goes back to
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.960]  Brazinski to Bloomberg saying they knew in advance that riots were coming and
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.320]  they had to control them because there was a global political awakening going
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.360]  on if you want to look at a real genuine revolution look at Greece you know
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.600]  they've been in revolt for nearly two years they know the enemy they're
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:03.320]  stopping the IMF World Bank vultures from entering their public buildings
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:07.000]  they're not talking about reelecting the very same people who were in league
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.560]  with the vultures which is what they're talking about basically politically
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.000]  stringing up pop and rayoff they're there they're literally beating up and
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.400]  egging and dragging out bankers anywhere they're found IMF World Bank vultures
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:24.320]  not their corner bank they're not going to local resort owned by a Greek who
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:29.920]  employs 500 people and beating him up they're going after the insiders so
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.160]  yeah it's just about having a little being able to hold more than one thought
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:37.520]  in your head at one time and realizing that you know the so-called Arab Spring
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:41.680]  was manipulated from the beginning the London riots that was called the the
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.880]  onset of a new revolution we dismissed that at the time we said it was it was
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:49.960]  basically a flash mob riot again we were proven right with that and with this
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:53.940]  when it's being pushed by the very interest who were in bed with Wall
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:58.320]  Street it's not anti Wall Street so that these leftists really need to get
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.520]  that through their heads and join the activists who are already chanting in
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.760]  the Fed and protesting against the banks Wall Street is an incredibly diverse
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:11.160]  tens of thousands of companies it's six big mega banks you talk to a regular
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.960]  trader even at a prominent company is on insider they'll tell you the insiders
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.960]  are using regulators to shut them down this general thing of capitalism and
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.840]  Wall Street and any company that has stocks and bonds is is is automatically
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:29.600]  bad this is pure baloney you know many cities public works and things are
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:33.920]  traded as bonds and things on Wall Street and people's pension funds this is
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:39.360]  baloney this is the bankers the inner group using the crisis to take out the
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:44.160]  local regional banks and and other companies it's all about monopoly and

[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:26.320]  ladies and gentlemen you can tell that I'm wound up and it's because the
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:30.160]  Federal Reserve is running this operation and they announced last week we
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:34.400]  knew two weeks before that they're spying on the American people and those
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:38.280]  that criticize them they're making a list of them well good put my John Hancock
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:42.800]  up at the top these people want to shut down our farms and ranches everything
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.840]  they want total control they've set up NAFTA and GATT to shut us down they
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:50.600]  write white papers about a post-industrial America this isn't some
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:56.560]  boss-hall good ol boy of us these are wicked people and they cannot stand us
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.480]  identifying them they've got the Republicans of Democrats bought they
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:03.160]  don't have you and I bought they don't have Ron Paul bought what they've done
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:06.560]  is so outrageous and it's outrageous that they're trying to take over the
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.840]  demonstrations now he's down there and this is what I saw two weeks ago I knew
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.000]  they were there the George Soros move on people and I knew they'd originally
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.440]  called to the date knowing that people that were against the banks were coming
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.160]  out but but Jacobs is down there so far today interviewing folks and they are
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:26.400]  not communists calling for all this so that means that the mainstream media is
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.400]  only interviewing the people they want putting out that one message as if
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.640]  communism is the way you beat the bankers when they're actually the author of
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:37.800]  it let's go ahead and get his take on that Rob Jacobs and tell us what's
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.880]  happening there in Manhattan yeah I'm over here in Liberty Square and we
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.600]  interviewed a bunch of people and it's true how many people mentioned the
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.880]  communist solution or anything like that a lot of people gave me mostly
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:56.480]  quizzical answers are here for us to be part of the occupation spiritual
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:01.680]  movement you did ask somebody here who's giving out food where the food is
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:07.280]  coming from and she mentioned that it's coming from besides donations also
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:11.280]  groups that have come together to donate them we're gonna get to the bottom of
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.120]  that and find out the names of those groups specifically to see who exactly
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:20.880]  is donating food to the occupation but most of the people here seem to just be
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:27.760]  here to experience a protest scenario a community scenario I asked one gentleman
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:31.880]  to travel a far distance about what his opinion on what the Federal Reserve's
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:37.960]  relationship with this protest is he wasn't sure and that's basically the
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:44.400]  sentiment that I'm getting from most of the protesters out here so far all right
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.840]  now I know there's more protests coming up today you're gonna be popping in over
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:53.360]  the next few days with us break down some of the places you're gonna be going
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:57.720]  today well we'll be following the protest as they take off everybody's still
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:01.600]  assembling right now we're gonna see where they're gonna go I happen to know
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:06.880]  on Wednesday it's been reported that unions are organizing to come down here
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:12.240]  so that should be pretty interesting they have to say well we know they want
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:16.080]  to go thank Obama for shipping their jobs overseas and they want to call for
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:20.640]  higher taxes to get rid of the middle class so nobody can afford to hire their
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:25.520]  janitorial services I mean that's basically the move yeah that in fact
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:28.880]  what do you think of the fact that they have announced the White House has
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:32.520]  admitted move on is admitted they quote are gonna take over the movement well
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:36.400]  they they're the ones that called it so I guess they let grassroots then show up
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:40.720]  and then they come and claim that it's their movement I think it's just more
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:44.640]  or less par for the courts it seems to be the same game they always play they
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:49.920]  wait for a grassroots movement to show up they anticipate co-opting them and then
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:53.040]  they do it and I feel that that's what's going on here there's a lot of
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:59.160]  legitimate people here who do want to see legitimate change but they're not
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:03.480]  sure where to begin or where to look and I feel that their intentions are gonna
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:07.520]  be co-opted again and I feel we're gonna see a happy presence of the co-opters on
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:12.280]  Wednesday well that's right right now they're just selectively showing clips
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:16.080]  of the demonstrations that have taken place and showing different move on
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.480]  groups leading demonstrations the media is like here's our wonderful little
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:22.760]  revolutionaries let's hear what they're calling for you were the one that
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:25.880]  pointed out to me this morning that Al Gore had called for an Arab spring a
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.800]  month ago well that's Mr. Anti-establishment and then also the film
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:35.160]  the 1% by Jamie Johnson with Bill Gates senior in it calling for total
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:38.960]  socialism and here's the Wall Street Journal of New York Times endorsing it
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.040]  I mean the bankers love like insurance companies writing up socialist health
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:46.840]  care is a way to make more of us buy their product I mean they really know
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:51.360]  how to do it don't they exactly they write the laws they write the rules and
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.320]  they write the loopholes and leave themselves out and I believe that that
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:01.600]  was the message I was being given by Bill Gates senior in that movie and I
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:05.640]  think it's the same thing reverberating over and over again in the headline what
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:11.360]  we see right now is you know they blame hey let's tax the rich in general but
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:15.640]  what they failed to say is that they're gonna leave themselves out and really
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:21.120]  tax people who legitimately are entrepreneurs and real capitalists
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:25.560]  people who climb the ladder and successfully made products for themselves
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:30.940]  names for themselves let's tax them and not tax the people who own these
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:35.200]  offshore banks who like the rules that's right these elite these elite
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:40.080]  hereditary families who have been tax-free since 1906 sitting here
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:43.480]  lecturing us when they're a bunch of eugenicists we're gonna check in more
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:46.600]  with you later I want to say bye to you in the break then coming up we're gonna
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:51.800]  look at the immigration issue then Max Kaiser's coming up we're on the March the

[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:11.080]  are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:16.200]  listeners to do three things right away number one study the past history
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:21.000]  really does repeat itself number two learn to spot the dangerous food

[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:32.160]  brewing or a global food crisis that's why I'm telling everyone to read the new

[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:20.240]  world order it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:25.520]  show Bloomberg and other major publications report that over $27
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:30.200]  trillion $16.6 of it was secret until losses were filed and finally came out a
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:35.600]  few months ago was paid to mainly foreign mega banks and domestic media MSNBC
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:39.560]  got hundreds and hundreds of millions to sit up there and demonize anybody that
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.080]  cares about this country that is government paid for federal reserve
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:48.480]  paid for private banker paid for propaganda with your money and they've
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:53.880]  got all these HBO films like 1% with the elitist rich kid going public and
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.280]  oh let's tax the rich they mean people making a hundred thousand dollars a
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:04.140]  year the global elite are exempt they want austerity money they get the new
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:08.560]  VAT and sales tax that are being pushed for by Bill O'Reilly Bill O'Reilly on
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:12.440]  one side of the spectrum and on the other George Soros and Warren Buffett
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:19.280]  so we're breaking that down now here's Roseanne Barr making the point that we
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:23.600]  should behead the bankers Roseanne Barr behead the bankers rich who won't give
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:27.400]  up their wealth well well if somebody made a widget made a billion dollars
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:32.920]  greater wrote a book and you know Mark Twain made it hundreds and hundreds of
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:36.640]  millions of you in today's money some would argue billions should he be
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:41.240]  strong up somebody who invents a new piece of medical equipment no no no
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:44.520]  that's that's that's that's that's reasonable that's good that's what
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:48.000]  creates wealth we know communism doesn't work unless you want it you think
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.400]  working is total tyranny and death and enslavement but this idea that all
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:58.000]  rich are bad that's all being funded by Wall Street and Drudge Report has top
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.520]  linked our articles on that breaking down the fact of White House is funding
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:05.280]  this mainline Occupy Wall Street group at least the people getting the
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:10.200]  attention on the news are move on dot org George Soros White House people the
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:13.440]  unions and they now admitted that this morning that yeah we've been involved
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:17.440]  from the beginning and we're totally running it now don't you people that
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:21.040]  attacked me over the weekend feel stupid again I mean all I'm doing is
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:25.480]  reporting the facts here just to say capitalism's bad Wall Street's bad
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:28.880]  that's pretty big target isn't it no we're talking about the private
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.840]  Federal Reserve that lobbies for open borders we're gonna be talking about that
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.680]  in a moment with William Gein the head of alley pack with an update on some of
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.160]  the treason going on but first I wanted to get to this Roseanne Barr clip here
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:45.280]  it is ways I first would allow the guilty bankers to pay you know the ability
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:50.400]  to pay back anything over 100 million personal wealth because I believe in a
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.640]  maximum wage of $100 million and if they're unable to live on that amount
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:58.600]  then they should you know go to the edgy reeducation camps and if that doesn't
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:03.280]  help then be beheaded now we just recently saw the guillotine rolled out in
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:08.160]  a huge protest in Israel fine there you go in the street you know I remember when
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:11.720]  I had the zeitgeist guy on and I said I don't want to go live in your plastic
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:15.960]  city and have a computer run everything know who programs the computer and he
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:21.760]  said well you'll be sent to a reeducation center and I recently called him up
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:25.760]  so once you come back home let's have a friendly discussion Peter Joseph that's
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:28.840]  a stage name I guess and he said okay I'm gonna send you a list of things you
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:31.000]  gotta admit we're wrong and I said well I'm gonna be friendly if something's
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.800]  wrong tell me he sent me stuff and said he didn't say that I went back to the
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:37.760]  video and there it was I was like well I didn't say that he's like well I'm not
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:44.560]  coming on then well fine so so I mean this is Roseanne Barr I think was saying
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:48.560]  that to be flippant to get attention you know I don't think she really thinks
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:51.760]  we should see people to reeducation camps this is a woman that's made tens of
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:58.640]  millions of dollars it's always rich people that that that want the guy
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:04.520]  making 125,000 a year to pay more money to foreign banks here's Michael more
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:07.880]  than we're going to our guests here it is Michael what do you think about ending
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:12.320]  the Federal Reserve Banking System the private banking system I think there's
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:18.160]  a larger it's there's a larger issue to deal with and capitalism that's the
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:23.400]  problem capitalism capitalism has to go
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:31.640]  okay folks so I gave this time I deliberated I researched it for two
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.320]  weeks and it's just what I saw day one but I don't want to come out and say it
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:39.360]  day one now the media says this is the revolution and it's communism run by a
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.640]  bunch of rich people because that's where they got their money was through
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:47.760]  government financing and government jobs and government bailouts oh yeah
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:50.720]  Holly was one of the biggest recipients of that now I take you to
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:55.280]  William Gean Gean was just a quick update frequent guests to the show
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:02.520]  alleypack.us that's Americans for legal immigration and I wanted to just go
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:05.880]  with a waterfront with him briefly here today because a lot's happening not with
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.840]  a bang with a whimper Obama just said we're not going to basically deport
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:14.000]  illegals anymore and when they do arrest illegals it's been confirmed even Fox
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.160]  News reported they they actually give them green cards on the spot or hire them
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.960]  to build the fence and but I can't go to Mexico though I'm illegal they'll put
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:26.320]  me in forced labor for six months to a year but that's okay as America goes
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:30.960]  bankrupt and he's also been putting out press releases on Ricky Perry Ricky Bobby
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:36.120]  there and a lot more so with the latest is America's only real no compromise
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:41.440]  group defending the sovereignty of this country and it's good to have you all
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:45.080]  with us sir hey glad to be with you Alex a quick question before we get into the
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:49.280]  the main topic here a lot of times when you do your show do you find it like
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:53.280]  your private conversations with friends and family and stuff like that end up
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:56.480]  influencing what you end up presenting to the public sometimes or help your
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:01.960]  thoughts or ideas sort of progressive a bit elaborate on that I mean explain
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:05.360]  exactly what you're asking well I just got back from a weekend with some very
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:08.440]  close friends and family members and we carried on conversations about these
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:12.000]  topics globalism illegal immigration and things like that and I find that after
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.880]  spending time with certain people my wording and how I want to work things
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:22.520]  now I want to communicate things seems to develop a bit when I'm not on the air
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:26.440]  sometimes develops on the air in the course of an interview but I guess
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:30.040]  my point being is that I find it a lot of the content that I end up coming to the
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:36.040]  table with on a show like yours develops in private conversations and yes I
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:40.600]  totally agree with you it's all happening in real common sense out of the box
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:45.080]  discussions not in this fake Alice in Wonderland thing that the mainstream
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:49.040]  media puts out yes I see what you're saying well and I think so even folks
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:53.560]  that are not on the air like you and I are are part of the national conversation
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:57.040]  or the development of these ideas that are going on out there but at that that
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:01.840]  that being said it makes me wonder who North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue's
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:06.560]  been talking with in private and maybe Roseanne Barr and some of these others
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:11.680]  that recently have started to let slip some real draconian ideas it makes me
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:14.640]  wonder about some of their private conversation and who bends their ears
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:17.920]  behind the scene when they're not well their public conversation is about
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:23.440]  martial law reeducation camps suspending elections I mean this is a scary group
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:31.600]  and Adam Kokesh had a video with Occupy Wall Street people there in DC who are
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:36.080]  you know liberal Obama supporters from major universities and they said we're
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:39.560]  going to use government to be authoritarian to rob the rich and then
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:43.440]  it's Wall Street the same ones that want globalism that are financing these
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:46.960]  people but what may be happening here Alex so based off my experience
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:50.320]  personal experience is that while they're not being asked to protect these
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:54.400]  messages and they're not being asked to present this to the public people around
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:57.960]  them and with them are having these conversations yes and when they're
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:02.920]  speaking off the cuff to them a Kiwanis meeting or on a talk radio show and they
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:06.720]  didn't get enough sleep last night and their guard is down it's it's
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.680]  manifesting because we're really hearing it from the only reason I was I was
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:14.080]  speculate on that is because we're hearing it from so many different
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:17.160]  directions no I don't think you're speculating and I'm a little dense now
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:22.640]  I get where you're going absolutely this is what they talk about behind closed
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:26.920]  doors William just a few months ago I had a prominent quote civil rights
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:31.240]  activists down here to interview for a film and we went out to dinner and the
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:34.120]  guy had a few drinks and he said we're really communist and we're gonna kill
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:38.160]  everybody and I just kind of said okay dinner's over and I'm not even really
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:42.480]  gonna use the interview but when you get I mean this is it they're planning to
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:47.720]  kill everybody I mean this is really a red terror well they sort of have to if
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:52.800]  they're going to at a certain point of it and you know I think that you know
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:58.040]  people accuse some of us of being a bit exaggerated or not a new term that I've
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:03.240]  just started to use regarding illegal immigration I want to convey the the
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:07.520]  meaning and the power of the situation we faced is illegal immigration neutron
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:12.440]  bomb it's a way that they can take this country and leave all the assets and
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:17.360]  place by merely removing the people that once lived here and replacing us with
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:22.920]  other people that are more malleable to their globalist plans and you know well
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:26.080]  that's right if somebody asked me why are am I against these wide open borders
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:29.120]  and legal immigration it's because I've seen the numbers and I know you've
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:34.280]  studied them over 90% tend to end up voting absolute hardcore liberal
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:39.240]  Democrat anti-guine socialism and if you've seen how that's done for folks in
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:43.200]  Mexico 40,000 dead in the last three years worse than Vietnam per year and
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:48.240]  the elite uses that system to control the people and I mean that's it and and
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:51.480]  this is how the globalists want to destroy America and that's how ever
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:55.320]  everybody listening out there that's your future and your future you won't
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:59.280]  have guns like we do now people in Mexico only the government and the
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:04.080]  thugs are allowed to have guns legally everybody else is powerless and you will
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:08.460]  be controlled with bodies and corpses hung from overpasses with their
[01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:13.320]  genitalia exposed as a message to those of you that might even whisper any type
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:18.840]  of resistance on a social media website this is how people live under
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:24.880]  autocratic regimes or totalitarian regimes and it's exactly where we're
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.080]  headed and it's where I believe very powerful global forces want to take us
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:33.560]  and illegal immigration is key to it because they can't overthrow the United
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:38.080]  States without a large volume of millions of people that are willing to do
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:44.760]  horrible things to us you talk about reeducation camps and I guess you would
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:48.680]  call them a communism country was it pogroms is that the correct yes pogroms
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:52.920]  yes it's been a while since my poly side degree pogroms are conducted you
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:56.120]  have to have people who are willing to conduct those programs and since
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:00.040]  Americans even though we're divided between liberals and conservatives and
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:05.320]  republicans and democrats while we're not willing to put our mothers in camps
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:09.840]  others from outside the country that our streets harden that are being promised
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:16.400]  a promised land to be exalted from the abject terrible poverty conditions of
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:22.720]  Brazil and Mexico will do quite horrendous things to us and exchange for
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:26.600]  being elevated in power above us and that is the plan and unfortunately it's the
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:30.760]  plan that eventually shared by both Barack Obama and globalist like Rick
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:35.840]  Perry well you're right I'm digging around for an article about Cameron over
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:40.520]  in England and it's got the headline you know we will not let the British have
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:44.200]  a referendum on entering the EU which then takes their sovereignty and jacks
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:47.960]  up their taxes because I feel like we need to be part of it I mean it's just
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.680]  doesn't matter of 80 plus percent are against it they're gonna do it doesn't
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:54.680]  matter if Congress has a 9% approval rating they're gonna do it doesn't
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:59.200]  matter of 99.9% didn't want the bank or bailout they're gonna do it and and
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:03.080]  they're gonna use the police state to clamp down on the American people and I
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:07.480]  was driving through Texas over 70 miles from the border yesterday never was in
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:12.120]  Mexico huge checkpoints they're building all over the country some cases a hundred
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:16.920]  miles deep and they were pulling citizens black white Hispanic matter out of
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:20.960]  their car searching them and they got to me in my RV and I said you're and I'm
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:24.200]  gonna air this tonight on my TV show at seven I said I you're not gonna search
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:27.400]  me and I said I know the government's been caught bringing in the drugs I know
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:30.840]  you let the illegals through and they didn't they kind of got my face at first
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:34.240]  and I said look it's unconstitutional what you're doing you're not gonna do it
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:38.680]  they said okay go but and the point is they were smiling too they know they
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:42.080]  know their order to let the illegals through they know their order was select
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:45.520]  packages let the drugs in that's come out in federal court and I'm tired of it
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:49.800]  I'm tired of it you know it's time I don't even know what else to say anymore
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:52.840]  my friend it's just making me sick well and we had to be careful about you know
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:57.280]  I've said some comments on the another show I won't mention any show because of
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:02.880]  about the quorum here but a Christian radio show and I mentioned that the
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:08.560]  Obama administration was placing American citizens into a terrible
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:14.400]  predicament by passing an amnesty that's the wrong word by decree an amnesty
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:20.600]  the not even executive order executive order is too proper of a term to describe
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:25.920]  what he's done amnesty by memo is what he's done okay it's not passed by
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:30.320]  Congress it's not an official executive order it was not released to the media
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:36.800]  it was done by memo and then leaked out which is how this slimy corrupt criminal
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:42.440]  administration does its business similar to wave George Bush did his business
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:47.760]  except we never had the good as much he's putting the American public into a
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:51.600]  situation where they're like okay well we've written Congress we fact Congress
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:55.000]  we've got involved in elections and the election system is so far corrupted that
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.920]  it's either you know we can't compete against the billionaire funded
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:03.640]  globalist candidates and even if we do get some good candidates in it doesn't
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:07.040]  matter what Congress passed anyway because the presidents which are more
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:11.480]  beholden to Saudi Arabia China and George Soros are gonna do whatever and
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:15.480]  it's putting the American public into the the situation that I oppose the
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:19.280]  situation I have thought to prevent a situation that if it should ever
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:24.120]  escalate to this point my job as the MLK and Gandhi politics of illegal
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:29.640]  immigration and immigration enforcement is is over and failed but Americans are
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:35.120]  being forced to choose between submission just deal with it accept it
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:41.400]  ignore it go on about your business it's been done you know quiet now bow your
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:46.720]  head down on your knee we'll get to you later if you open your mouth we'll get
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:53.520]  to you now submission versus extra political violent and illegal things
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:57.360]  that I can't even talk about because I don't know you know I have no part in
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:03.240]  them but it's where Americans are being forced into that predicament and that's
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:07.680]  why we're trying to communicate to Congress Congress you must act not only
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:12.040]  has the president ordered and a and illegal amnesty for illegal immigrants
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:16.600]  but he's pretty much been caught red-handed using our tax money while the
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:19.760]  banks you know you're talking about the banks and the looting of the United
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:25.920]  States of America while the United States is being looted by those that
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:32.000]  have control over our government at the same time Obama their guy their boy has
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.480]  been using our tax money to buy thousands of assault weapons and now
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:40.400]  possibly grenades and putting them into the hands of the invading force of
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:45.000]  methamphetamine cocaine and illegal immigrant importing smugglers he has
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:51.240]  put those guns in their hands and actually arming an insurgent force that
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:56.760]  is now around us in every county in America they could hit us one night and
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:00.440]  knock us back to the Stone Age and they wouldn't have to hit the Hispanic
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:04.840]  neighborhood they wouldn't have to hit most of the urban black areas all they
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:11.880]  got to do is one night hit mom and pop countryside and come middle America's
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:16.040]  middle class and there'd be so much smoke on the rise about the morning that
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:20.080]  this nation would be done well we've already what going back five six years
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:25.800]  ago the illegals all over Arizona they'll burn 1516 houses in a night the
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:29.200]  American flag can't even be flown in San Francisco the illegals don't even let
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:32.800]  people wear that to school and they say you don't bring those colors here in
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:36.480]  the school of grief you wear an American flag you're out of school I mean it's a
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:40.040]  globalist domination plan Americans have been taught to not be patriotic to not
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:44.160]  care about their country what they had the other big Mexican football game
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:50.160]  there in Los Angeles a few months ago and they booed the American team even
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:54.360]  when they lost and during the you know medals being handed out the other cup
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:59.080]  being handed out and they interviewed people at the game and about 85% of
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:02.280]  those that were there were for the Mexican team most of Americans and they
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:06.960]  said well I live in America and I'm an American citizen but I like Mexico and
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:13.000]  you know my whole thing is Mexico is a narco terror state run by big globalist
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.040]  banks I mean what is there to love sure there's some neat culture food pretty
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:21.080]  beaches all that I mean that I guess you could say is the culture but they buy
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:25.280]  into this gangster culture that's so horrible and then and then we're supposed
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:29.800]  to just go under it here and it's just terrible I mean there's probably no
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:34.080]  country on earth now as dangerous or as horrible as Mexico has become well I've
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:38.120]  looked at this very closely and some of them do buy in as you describe Alex but
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:43.320]  a lot of these kids which I used to be one of okay they are being mind molested

[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:26.640]  okay folks we're talking to the head of alley pack William Dean and we're gonna
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:29.240]  have to definitely have him back up in the near future to talk about everything
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:34.840]  that's happening but government shipping in just one shipment alone 2,000 guns to
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:39.880]  Mexico allowing Sinaloa to then ship cocaine in that's all in federal court
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:43.320]  the feds have come in at a minute yes it's true the head of the Sinaloa
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:48.600]  cartel in the US works for us I mean this is a this is a totally criminal
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:52.960]  government and they're going for broke that's why they're so dangerous they're
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:58.440]  going for broke right now and they've come in and said well we're just gonna
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:03.480]  now not deport people that's already been happening for a long time but now
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:07.000]  they're just announcing it where does it go from here I mean this is complete
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.320]  lawlessness for me I see it almost as a good sign because we're forcing the
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:16.520]  crooks out in the open William they are coming out in the open but I also think
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:21.160]  they're keeping the debt raised and the unemployment benefits and the welfare
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:25.920]  benefits all that's flowing for as long as possible until every last job that
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:30.280]  can possibly be removed from America has been displaced before they turn the
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:35.240]  lights out they want to complete this plan to just strip us to where we
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:38.200]  couldn't stand and even you know we couldn't march against them because we
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:44.160]  couldn't even have shoes on our feet if they didn't want us to you know by the
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:48.000]  way they admit that's their plan totally destroy America post industrial
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.320]  collapse everything have a stage communist revolution wipe out the modal
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:56.600]  class promising the welfare hordes goodies if they take part in it that
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:02.720]  is the plan the globalists have decided on a red terror option in America well
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:06.400]  they try to explain people this is a form of warfare that is being practiced
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:09.520]  against the United States and the people the current people of the United
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:13.560]  States of America and I tell look if you don't believe me you don't understand
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:18.560]  just plant the seed in your mind and then let things proceed and you know I'm
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:22.560]  open-minded if my theory were to be incorrect but when I look and I see
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:26.160]  most of the movies and the theaters are remakes of movies there were and books
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:31.040]  there were once great books that fits my theory because you can't outsource
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:35.680]  movie making to China and Mexico and then make us sell it back to us you can't
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:38.960]  take good rock and roll and make it in Mexico and China and sell it back to us
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:43.800]  thus creating a suction sucker to suck more of the life force out and wealth
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:49.840]  out of Americans and America across the board if they can't move it out of the
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:53.920]  country they're just closing it down they can't put illegal immigrants in
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:57:00.640]  NASA and still reach other planets so they close it down my theory is strong
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:06.160]  and it is correct no no no sir that's the stated globalist eugenics post
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:11.440]  industrial model and I appreciate you joining us William we look forward to
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:16.960]  learning more invaluable news alerts and information at the website and we do
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:20.480]  appreciate you spending time with us today thanks Alex please send folks by

[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:40.080]  of them were talking about all three stations were talking about our article
[02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:44.200]  on the drudge report Wall Street protesters call for reelection of
[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:49.280]  Obama but I had to listen to each station three or four minutes as they
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:53.360]  were reintroducing topics in my 35 minute drive in to hear them get to my
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:57.200]  story as the main story they were talking about was Max Kaiser's interview
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:04.160]  with Roseanne Barr where she said the head bankers and the rich who won't give
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:09.560]  up their wealth and send them to reeducation camps if you make a hundred
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:12.520]  million dollars or more of course then it'll be a million dollars it'll be a
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:18.280]  hundred thousand dollars my god my god communism I mean there's nothing worse

[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:57.760]  Matt in Texas Matt what do you think of all this hey Alex I think it's a
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:01.840]  perfect opportunity for the info war we are change activists to spread the word
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:06.360]  because look we can use their own sound bites I mean we are the 99% I think
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:11.360]  info warriors we are change cats we're gonna launch expose the 1% and with this
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:15.040]  show for these rallies have signs that say the Federal Reserve the Biltburg
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:18.360]  group and not really Alex I wanted to call in because over here in San Antonio

[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:25.200]  yes that's what Rob Jacobs is finding the mainstream media is showing the
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:29.760]  communist and making people think that this go after Wall Street thing is
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:34.320]  communist basically I guess to discredit it with the conservatives but also then
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:40.120]  sell the left on wealth redistribution which of course won't go to them it'll
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:45.880]  go to the bankers so Thursday very exciting folks need to be at that and I

[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:14.160]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:34.160]  okay here is the reason headline Ralph Nader hearts Ron Paul hails potential
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:39.600]  left libertarian alliance they agreed to meeting a few days ago that the end the
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:43.320]  Wall Street movement should focus on ending the private fellow reserve so
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:46.640]  there for all of you out there on the left my issue is when I hear stuff like
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:52.160]  in capitalism it's the problem and I hear stuff like put people in reeducation
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:58.040]  camps you know cut the bankers heads off how about if you've committed a crime
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:02.120]  how about if you've done something wrong how about if you're the Federal
[02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:06.640]  Reserve and these top JP Morgan Goldman Sachs shelling derivatives to private
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:12.280]  corporate and government people that's who we need to rebel against look at
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:16.240]  Europe look at the austerity moves cut the pension funds cut everything raise
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:20.440]  the taxes pay it in to the bankers for the derivatives that are impossible to
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:27.320]  pay back Max Kaiser so many others predicted this now I'm seeing the
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:31.560]  mainstream media pretty much only focus on the communist or reeducation camp
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:36.760]  element instead of talking about hey let's end the Federal Reserve hey let's
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:40.880]  let's make Wall Street not get these bailouts let's let the market work this
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:44.760]  isn't the market we've been seeing now we've got somebody on here in short
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:48.920]  notice that we really appreciate coming on and and the clip the full clip is at
[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:55.880]  Max Kaiser comm all over talk radio all over TV this clip without even looking
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:59.000]  three radio stations I was listening to this morning turned it on they were
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:05.120]  talking about this and then secondarily our article dealing with the fact that
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:11.240]  the Occupy Wall Street group is basically now being hijacked by move on
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:14.760]  org of the Democratic Party itself run by Wall Street along with the
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:20.000]  Republicans now we've got the Republican leadership also calling for VAT and
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.960]  sales taxes to pay off our debt when it's not our debt so they're part of it
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:27.240]  to you conservatives out there have got to see the talking points they're
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:30.960]  attacking us from both ends they got the general public who's kind of you know
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:35.760]  poor liberal who's not sophisticated enough to understand raising taxes on
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:39.560]  somebody making 125,000 a year is not getting the rich guys that are exempt
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:43.320]  like Warren Buffett who comes out and says raise taxes but not on him it's a
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:47.080]  bait and switch you got conservatives saying Wall Street's perfect give them
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:51.480]  all the bailouts they want pay more taxes to bail them out it's criminal
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:57.080]  you're here O'Reilly Glenn Beck all of them pushing it now his interview with
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:01.320]  Roseanne Barr which did get you know cut down so when he let me talk about the
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:08.560]  full import of it you know she says well you're making over a hundred million
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:12.040]  dollars a year cap it at that and then if you won't go along with that you know
[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:15.360]  go to a reeducation camp but if that doesn't work off of your head we played
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:20.000]  that clip earlier but I want to cover that and then move on because it happened
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:25.320]  on Max's show on RT and then get to his view on where he sees this whole whole
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:28.160]  situation going Max Kaiser good to have you on with us today
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:34.680]  oh Alex Jones it is a pleasure to be with you once again although I must say I
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:38.760]  was hoping that when you came out of break you would play some of that Billy
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:44.160]  idle music because I love it okay I tell you what we'll go we'll come back into
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:48.520]  the next break with rebel yell for you how does that sound oh that's awesome
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:53.600]  or would you like white wedding I'm kind of partial to white wedding I think
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:56.440]  we've got that one I know we've got eyes a lot of face we'll see what happens
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:01.120]  here now Max Roseanne Barr I've seen her in some causes I agree with I've seen
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:03.920]  the clips you know shorter clips I don't have time to watch your whole
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:07.720]  interview whether but but I mean is that out of context where she's saying cut
[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:14.680]  people's heads off that make too much money no because we're talking about you
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:18.440]  know there's a couple things going on here and first of all let me say about
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:22.560]  Roseanne Barr I met her through Twitter it turns out that we know we have some
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:27.680]  friends of very close friends that we have in common so we ended up having a
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:33.160]  very got up to speed very quickly talking with each other and I was talking
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:39.960]  to her about my ideas and of course the decapitation then went on in 1793 in
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:45.960]  France during the reign of terror this is part of the pushback of that time
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:50.920]  against the bankers and you saw that guillotine being raised in Tel Aviv
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:56.680]  recently as part of that 500,000 strong march against you know what I call the
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:00.720]  global insurrection against banker occupation I put all of these campaigns
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:06.040]  together and I heard you yesterday heard your show talking about the Fed and the
[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:11.320]  Dallas Fed and you know we can talk about that as well I see this all kind of
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:17.240]  merging into one thing Roseanne is a warrior the decapitation thing the call
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:22.840]  for decapitation is what people had to resort to back in 1793 when the social
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:28.800]  contract was broken in 1790 John Locke said when the social contract is broken
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:33.760]  the people must revolt and the social contract has clearly broken nobody's
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:39.000]  doing anything about this overpopulation of bankers and that there needs to be
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:46.800]  some addressing of this now where I where Roseanne and I where she talks about
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:55.120]  capping income which is not necessarily where I come from on this no you've got
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:59.560]  a cap speculation and leave everybody else alone instead of bailing out the
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:03.560]  speculators and then letting them be unregulated but still backed up with our
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:09.400]  tax money pulling back the speculators is what I've been talking about with you
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:12.520]  on your show and you've been talking about it with your other guests on your
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:17.520]  show and there are ways to do that so Roseanne and I are meeting up here in
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:23.600]  Paris or at the Kilkenomics Festival in Ireland next month and we are hoping to
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:27.600]  launch a couple of campaigns and I'm gonna have a time to sit down with
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:31.880]  their face-to-face and really give her my view of how these things are working
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:36.740]  but you know I have to contrast her though Alex was somebody like a Michael
[02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:40.760]  Moore because Michael Moore when he says that capitalism is the problem he
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:48.680]  clearly does not understand the problem he clearly has no ability to dig down a
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:55.240]  little deeper than to make a very facile shallow condemnation of a whole system
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:59.480]  of economics without really backing that up well yeah let me just make a
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:03.240]  comment here that's exactly what I said two hours ago Roseanne Barr is a real
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:08.000]  person she's frustrated I I understand that she believes she's coming from a
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:13.120]  good place so I respect that even though I disagree with her some but but
[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:16.600]  overall I see her frustration with more he's a guy that's made 200 plus
[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:21.080]  million dollars he knows what he's doing he knows that this system we've got is
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:29.240]  a crony insider monopoly double you know game that's tilted and and and still
[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:33.640]  tilted against the general public and that is the opposite of a free market as
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:38.160]  you've said so he knows Roseanne doesn't and that's why I look forward to trying
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:40.760]  to talk to her and I appreciate you putting her in contact with us we are
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:44.920]  talking to her because because I want to try to really flesh this out with her
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:49.200]  I'm not just here to fight with people and I understand her frustration but at
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:52.840]  the same time is that why I get what you're saying Michael Moore he knows
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:59.240]  exactly what he's doing Michael Moore is just he's a financial he's an illiterate
[02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:03.960]  when it comes to what capitalism is all about is his movie missed the mark by a
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:07.760]  mile since his movie capitalism a love story came out there's been five or six
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:12.800]  movies one called meltdown for example which really are fantastic and they
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:16.840]  really get into the problem this rigged market capitalism version this
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:22.200]  mutation of capitalism you know you're you're associate there Luke Ratowski I
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:26.000]  think his name is he did an interview with both Michael Moore and Peter Schiff
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:31.440]  asking about this very notion about the Federal Reserve system and Michael
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:34.600]  Moore had nothing to say about the Federal Reserve system so that shows
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:39.000]  that he hasn't given this much thought whereas Peter Schiff of course has given
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:42.600]  it a great deal of thought and offered up you know some very good insights I
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:46.600]  don't see eye-to-eye with him a hundred percent either but just to be clear just
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:50.920]  to be clear in that video is at info wars.com and we played clubs of it
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:56.120]  earlier I tend to disagree with you I've met Michael Moore he had a security
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:16:58.720]  guards assault me when I was doing nothing but standing on a street corner
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:03.160]  videotaping him and I hit the guy back you know he hit me with his elbow I
[02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:07.040]  rammed him full power and said you ready to get your head knocked in pal don't
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:11.320]  you touch me but the point here is is that he's a hypocrite it goes and
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:14.640]  confronts people all day but then you want to just ask him a question you know
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:18.760]  he has goons assault you and that's all in my film martial law I mean it's
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:22.720]  disgusting and and and I know people that know Michael Moore behind the scenes
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:28.960]  he knows what's going on okay if Michael Moore Max knows that the big mega
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:32.760]  banks want a communism for the general public to steal our wealth and take it
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:40.120]  offshore well be that as it may you know I want to I listened to you yesterday
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:44.520]  and you're talking about the Fed and and I think that was a very good important
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:48.120]  broadcast that you did and there's a lot there there's a lot of meat on the bone
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:54.000]  there because obviously the Occupy Wall Street it came into being it goes slow
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:58.640]  starting now it's spreading across the United States of course it overlaps
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:02.040]  stuff that you're doing and it overlaps stuff that's going on in countries around
[02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:05.520]  the world but to me it really is you know you've been saying that for a few
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:11.840]  years that there's a revolution coming now it appears as though this is it now
[02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:19.400]  it hasn't completely articulated itself to to to the point that it will pretty
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:24.400]  quickly but I think now we're in the beginning of the middle of this or yeah
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:27.440]  the beginning of the middle you know we're out of the talk phase there's
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:32.160]  actually now a pushback so sure for five years you predicted Salente many others
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:36.240]  we have now it's here my point is I don't think the Federal Reserve is going to be
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:40.760]  successful you know trying to turn this into some communist thing that's not
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:44.080]  going to work people are going to figure out it's the mega bankers it's the top
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:48.440]  of the pyramid yeah well Bloomberg Michael Bloomberg came out set and said
[02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:52.400]  yesterday that these protesters they shouldn't be angry at the bankers they
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:57.760]  should be helping the bankers obviously a lot of cause wallop and the guy is in
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:01.840]  the pocket of the worst financial terrorist element in New York and in
[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:06.440]  America and it was embarrassing because I lived in New York for many years and I
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:10.000]  consider myself to some degree a New Yorker and to listen to Michael Bloomberg
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:14.440]  spew that nonsense was embarrassing for me but you know people are beginning to
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:18.920]  realize that the central bank is the bank behind the banks and they
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:23.600]  understand that this is where people and I have a fantastic campaign I just
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:28.000]  thought of it today I wanted to tell you about it it's a new campaign idea that
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:37.680]  could go big what's that at midnight every night people reach into their
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:42.560]  pocket they pull out a dollar bill and they rip it into confetti and they
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:46.240]  throw it out the window and they say I'm not taking this anymore in other words
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:50.280]  rip up your dollar it's worthless anyway let's not pretend that it's worth
[02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:53.760]  anything that piece of paper in your pockets work and that would be a big
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:56.760]  phenomenon is there to be dollar bill pieces everywhere I want to hear where
[02:19:56.760 --> 02:20:00.880]  this is going with max geyser max stay there maxgeyser.com I'm Alex Jones then

[02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:16.480]  the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones I do say that I am for
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:20.880]  the return of the guillotine and that that is for the worst of the worst of
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:24.800]  the guilty you're singing to the choir on this show we've been advocating the
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:29.520]  guillotine for years now oh well fantastic we think alike in many ways I
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:34.640]  first would allow the guilty bankers to pay you know the ability to pay back
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:39.800]  anything over 100 million personal wealth because I believe in a maximum wage
[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:43.920]  of $100 million and if they're unable to live on that amount then they should
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:47.840]  you know go to the edgy reeducation camps and if that doesn't help then be
[02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:53.400]  beheaded now we just recently saw the guillotine rolled out in a huge protest
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:58.960]  in Israel 500,000 people in the streets basically they are part of this global
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:03.120]  what some call or I call the global insurrection against banker occupation
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:08.200]  has there been any communication between let's say the Tel Aviv Wall Street
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:13.480]  Athens Cairo Tunis this is a global uprising and do you see any of that
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:17.280]  global communication happening vis-a-vis Twitter and other sites or
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:33.400]  just yeah max I agree with you we just can't get enough Billy Idol you know
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:39.320]  by the way a little bird who's well I guess the progeny of Billy Idol says
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:43.680]  daddy's a fan we like Billy to come on the show cuz Alex is a fan and so is max
[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:49.860]  but side issue Kaiser Kaiser continuing here come on you know that that the
[02:25:49.860 --> 02:25:53.800]  neocons are gonna use that now her talking about reeducation camps and
[02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:57.720]  stuff I mean this is one of the biggest news stories in the country right now
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:03.200]  right well I break it down into parts the guillotine part is as I said your
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:07.480]  second to the choir now you know when somebody like Hank Paulson or when Tim
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:12.000]  Geiner comes to Europe as he did last week and said you need to load a bazooka
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.640]  with 3 trillion euros to fire at your banks we have to be able to say well
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:20.520]  we've got a guillotine waiting for you in other words that's our only recourse
[02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:24.560]  historically that's what we have I mean hopefully we don't have to use it but
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:28.040]  it would be stupid to say that we're not gonna use it but we don't have them to
[02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:32.120]  use because historically that's what happens when the bankers take over and
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:35.880]  they confiscate all the people's wealth the people say you know what I don't
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:39.600]  think we need anymore I got it and then they try to stick communism on as well
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:43.120]  the bankers set off short laughing and make a deal like communist China for the
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:47.420]  new totally enslaved people and we've got and then you get to the reeducation
[02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:51.840]  camp part I mean it's a scary thought I think Roseanne is you know you I'm gonna
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:54.960]  want to put words into her mouth you're gonna talk to her directly but it's a
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:59.520]  scary thing to say and and I think that was meant to be a scary thing to say
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:04.240]  but I'd say what's really scary for bankers is when they see somebody rip up
[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:08.120]  a dollar bill or a euro or some fiat money it's like showing a crucifix to
[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:12.440]  Dracula let's get into that let's so you're saying target the symbol of their
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:16.680]  fiat slave system and this will start getting news if there's just torn up
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:20.360]  dollar bills everywhere people will start saying what is this you could call it
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:23.680]  in as a news tip and say there's a bunch of torn up one dollar bills out here
[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:28.680]  what is it then they'll find that's a good stunt it's totally anonymous you
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:32.320]  rip up three or four dollar bills you create lots of confetti and you let the
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:36.360]  wind blow it around the street blow it around your neighborhood people are see
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:40.560]  all this money blowing in the wind and it's because first of all when bankers
[02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:44.160]  see that it scares the hell out of them because if somebody's willing to rip up
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:49.320]  a dollar it means they have lost their power over you that's the chain that
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:54.240]  keeps you enslaved is that paper dollar if you rip that dollar you're free and
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:58.040]  this is what scares the bankers like nothing else you won't believe the
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:02.480]  outrage that'll happen if they start to see torn up dollar bill confetti and
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:06.400]  you're all confetti and yen confetti all over the world from people who said you
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:09.800]  know I've had it with this nonsense and this is a while you're at it you could
[02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:13.480]  stamp him for wars.com on it that'll really enrage him now expanding on this
[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:18.920]  max what about my idea to go directly to the federal deserve banks and the same
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:22.560]  central banks in Europe same people own them as you know and and actually
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:28.320]  protest them and I'm gonna be visiting them I'm asking folks to occupy to stay
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:32.960]  there on the street to set up tents to move in either on the property or
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:36.360]  nearby it and I think the Federal Reserve is gonna kiss your hind end
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:39.720]  because when I've been there they're totally scared and they don't try to
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:42.640]  push us around except for the case of Aaron and them up at the Kansas City
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:46.280]  women then there were only two people because they don't want to have a rest
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:51.080]  to give it attention they wanted to stay very very quiet it's a bunch of hippies
[02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:54.880]  running around calling for the second coming of Mao say tongue and Stalin and
[02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:58.000]  and everybody mixed together then they're happy to give it attention but
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:01.080]  when we're actually protesting the King Daddy they get scared what do you think
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:06.880]  of that oh you're at the tip of the spear as you like to say now Wall Street is
[02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:11.920]  not the tip of the spear the Federal Reserve Bank is we've got occupied Wall
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:17.120]  Street has gone global and that is going to lead toward occupy the Federal
[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:23.240]  Reserve so it makes sense that you would take it to the next level you go to the
[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:29.400]  Reserve Bank and now you've got your part with this global movement of hundreds
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:33.240]  of thousands of people around the world so you're saying you're saying don't get
[02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:37.880]  in a fight with it don't let sorrows and people co-opted we just take over with
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:42.720]  the truth in the Fed we take over Occupy Wall Street and then that would be you
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:48.240]  can't lose because you're going into the heart of the Death Star so you can't lose
[02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:52.080]  you're on the right path stay there stay there we're on the March the

[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:42.560]  one the only Dave Mustaine yeah that's the one guy whose music when I listen to
[02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:53.680]  it then replays in my head I get him back on the show say hi to Dave and his
[02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:57.560]  wife listening okay ladies and gentlemen let's just stop right there and get
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:02.000]  focused against serious Webster Tarpley who last Wednesday on my show I already
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:06.400]  knew this but I was hoping it wouldn't get totally co-opted now Obama has said
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:10.120]  they're fully co-opting it move on org they're gonna try to come in and take it
[02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:14.240]  over top is gonna pop in in a minute but the good news is I've got reporters in
[02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:18.760]  San Antonio I've got reporters in New York right now Rob Jacobson I got
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:22.760]  reporters in Austin they say it's people that really know that Wall Street's
[02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:27.880]  corrupt and getting our tax money so the good news is Max Kaiser before we go
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:32.020]  to Tarpley is that the system's trying to co-opt this and it's not working in my
[02:34:32.020 --> 02:34:41.480]  opinion because the misery is so high the austerity is kicking in the economy
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:45.360]  is crashing and people are just realizing that there's no point in
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:49.600]  hoping for something better to come along they have to act now you know you're
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:53.280]  not too far from the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank it's one of the biggest
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:57.480]  Federal Reserve banks you know you could get enough people to create a circle
[02:34:57.480 --> 02:35:02.120]  entirely around the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank and say the head of this
[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:08.000]  bank come out with your hands up you know that's a great idea we're gonna be up
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:13.000]  there I can get up there by 5 30 or 6 I'm gonna leave here at 1 so I could be
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:17.680]  there easily by 5 we're gonna officially say it kicks off at 6 to dark which is
[02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:22.680]  about 7 30 or so Friday night then I'm gonna drive down to Houston high noon
[02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:27.440]  then to San Antonio 10 a.m. to noon the next day but I'm asking people about
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:30.480]  to get a press release out today Aaron Dice is in there writing it I'm asking
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:34.520]  people just do you know do it whenever you want or if it's five of you or a
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:38.240]  hundred of you get your groups together get you're in the Fed the Ron Paul
[02:35:38.240 --> 02:35:43.320]  campaign for liberty let's go don't let them just blame capitalism and any body
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:46.720]  that's on the stock market is some enemy that's got a you know go to the
[02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:50.800]  reeducation camp let's actually go after the banksters here yeah remember
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:56.720]  wake oh man you know this is when all this all got started the US attacked its
[02:35:56.720 --> 02:36:00.480]  own citizens now they're popping their own citizens overseas assassinating them
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:04.000]  without any due process so the civil war you what started in Waco was now
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.720]  outright civil war the Dallas Fed just circle the entire institution with a
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:13.320]  human chain and don't break the circle and just stay there until the head comes
[02:36:13.320 --> 02:36:17.800]  out and with his hands up you're under arrest well max let me then let you let's
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:21.800]  have you choose the location and this could be done by others other parts of
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:25.360]  country I'll get behind it I'll promote it if people get us the information this
[02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:29.120]  is this isn't you know get orders from headquarters it's go to the sound of the
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:34.540]  info guns as Paul Revere would say but I think again I'm gonna be showing up and
[02:36:34.540 --> 02:36:38.960]  speaking at Fed locations and promoting it and if it gets big enough down the
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:42.920]  road I would come and maybe stay for a week or so and do my broadcast there
[02:36:42.920 --> 02:36:47.000]  because we've got to identify them as the real threat they're hoping we're just
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.400]  going to show up for a few hours leave but if we stay there and occupy should
[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:57.160]  it be the Dallas Fed should it be the Houston Fed or the San Antonio Fed I
[02:36:57.160 --> 02:37:00.760]  mean I'm kind of thinking we got a big activist group at San Antonio we've got
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:04.000]  a lot of listeners in Dallas as well we've got like three affiliates in that
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:09.440]  general area of Northeast Texas several affiliates right there in DFW the Dallas
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:14.920]  Fort Worth Metroplex I'm thinking why not go ahead and just call for people
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:19.520]  from Friday night through the next Friday to occupy the area around the
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:24.040]  Dallas fellow reserve and really bring real attention on these people Max well
[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:27.680]  why don't you put it to Twitter and ask you know get whatever you get the
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:33.240]  biggest response do that you know my my I'm all about what to make it as easy as
[02:37:33.240 --> 02:37:37.280]  possible because I just want to win so you put it on Twitter you say here's the
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:41.240]  three locations see which what what the Twitter people are willing to do
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:47.840]  whatever the biggest responses do that by the way I'm gonna have Curt Nemo's
[02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:51.520]  out today but I think Aaron knows how to put up an info wars poll we could ask
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:58.880]  Dallas San Antonio or Houston and again I would say New York but we had
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:02.760]  listeners and we promoted it who had demonstrations one time the guy just
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:05.680]  put it on his Twitter nobody showed up and they had like 50 something cops
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:10.040]  ringing the fellow reserve in New York that's obviously the most important but
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:14.720]  there you kind of get overshadowed Texas is Texas is right through this because
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:18.680]  of the history as we just talked about it a minute ago that's what I'm saying
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:22.280]  hundreds showed up at the next one I promoted only a day's notice for New
[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:28.440]  York so I'm saying my gut tells me San Antonio Dallas Houston how about
[02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:33.360]  activists just occupy them all because it's not efficient Alex I mean if there's
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:37.960]  one thing I'm trying to bring to your show it's be efficient bring economies
[02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:42.120]  of scale just be as efficient as possible because you're dealing with an
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:46.240]  enemy that has an unlimited credit line that they pay nothing for and they
[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:51.040]  print trillions of dollars therefore we must be as smart and as efficient as
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:53.680]  possible okay I agree with you I agree with you but some people can't travel
[02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:56.600]  it's a big state now I'm gonna get Tarpleys take on this when you leave us
[02:38:56.600 --> 02:39:00.480]  but what are our list of demands you know obviously we're told it's the Warren
[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:04.200]  Buffett plan of raise taxes on the middle class pay it an austerity money
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:09.440]  to foreign banks that's not the hippie Duke useful idiot plan we're going with
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:14.680]  what are the demands say no to the derivatives bubble claw back the 16.5
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:22.360]  plus 16.6 trillion cut the defense budget by 50% pull our troops out of all
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:28.160]  foreign military bases I mean what do we demand to get our country back on a
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:35.920]  national bond to build maglev trains light pebble reactors that don't have
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:41.280]  these safety problems giant highway projects what do we do there's only
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:47.200]  one demand there's only one choice regime change you pick somebody maybe the
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:51.440]  head of the Dallas Fed and you're not leaving until they resign that's the
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:56.440]  demand and it's got to happen and you got to score a win it worked in Cairo it
[02:39:56.440 --> 02:40:00.400]  worked in Tunis it works whenever there's a revolution whoever's at the
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:06.200]  head they have to leave a regime change we want that guy out and we're not
[02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:10.000]  leaving until he leaves this way everybody knows that they have to stay
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:15.840]  until that guy leaves so it's very very simple that guy must leave well I want
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:19.200]  the abolishment of the federal reserve system and to go back to the Congress
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:23.480]  win that you can't win that with a protest like this because you're gonna
[02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:27.640]  end you're saying we need a symbolic victory to begin more victories it's not
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:31.480]  symbolic it's a real victory nobody wants to give up their cushy federal
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:36.320]  reserve job you know okay so we say we're gonna occupy federal reserve areas
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:43.560]  around the country until Ben Bernanke is indicted or resigns well again in my
[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:48.880]  opinion the one that would work and get traction and have an effect that really
[02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:55.680]  is workable as you pick a chair of one of these fed institutions like maybe
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:59.520]  Dallas we know that Jamie Diamond is both on the Federal Reserve Bank of
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:04.880]  New York he's one of the board members plus he's also the CEO of JP Morgan but
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:07.480]  okay you're not gonna go to New York you're gonna be in Texas and I have a
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:10.800]  feeling that you're gonna get great response in Texas so of those three
[02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:14.680]  federal reserve banks you have listed pick one that the people are there and
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:19.560]  willing to do find out who runs it then go there circle it and say we're not
[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:23.720]  leaving I agree with you I'll tell you another really powerful branch is the
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:27.320]  Kansas City and we have the footage of Aaron and Rob Jacobson being a half
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:31.800]  mile away and they come off security guards with guns and say leave and then
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:35.160]  and they say no and they start you know putting the hands on the guns so my
[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:39.440]  guys left to not cause problems but and then meanwhile Herman Cain used to be
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:43.160]  the head of that says oh just go say hi to him give him a call they're friendly
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:48.240]  look folks don't be intimidated by him we need we need to have demonstrations at
[02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:52.720]  all federal reserves and to call the media before you go days before but I'm

[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:13.080]  put out the info but as the way history turns it's been demanded that I be a
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:17.400]  leader and so I am into the fray cry have it can turn loose the dogs of the
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:22.160]  info war I am on I'm going to be speaking across the US I'm going to be

[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:30.480]  gonna let the bankers bring in a bunch of phony collectivist to sell austerity
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:34.040]  with a bunch of commies dancing around it's not even communism it's banker
[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:37.680]  induced fraud and a man who I keep saying this guest predicted that gets
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:41.960]  predicted partly in the Obama deception three years ago total precision that
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:47.560]  Libya would be invaded african Obama total war banker bailouts takeovers
[02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:53.560]  austerity imploding Europe into the euro new global superbank because he's
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:59.360]  reading their own documents he is a scholar a a cogiter who pours over the
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:03.480]  text of the globalist a doctor of history an economist a best-selling
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:09.600]  author an accomplished man who really is a great addition to our cadre
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:14.600]  against tyranny and I'm here to tell you that he last Wednesday spurred me
[02:45:14.600 --> 02:45:18.480]  because I've been sitting there for about a week and a half no I know there's
[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:22.800]  George Soros people here and I know they've got this big push of the 1% by
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:27.320]  the big oligarchs to then tax with VAT and sales tax and they've got all the
[02:45:27.320 --> 02:45:30.960]  neocon hosts promoting as well to pay what we quote oh it'll just put the
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:34.960]  country in a cardiac arrest we don't know this they got Beck promoting the
[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:39.240]  the VAT taxes and the sales taxes O'Reilly the list goes on and on
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:46.560]  Hannity all of them Herman Cain Neil Snorts warts all of them just cold
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:51.040]  bloodedly in their hitness and hitness hard and tarply exposed it but now the
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:55.080]  Democratic Party admits they're running it all of it but I've got reporters all
[02:45:55.080 --> 02:45:57.560]  over the country they say that the people they're actually are aware of the
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:01.520]  New World Order the oligarchs they don't want to bail out they understand what's
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:04.920]  happening but the media webs are the dominant corporate whore media that's
[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:09.360]  starting to die but still hanging on she'll able to put a hoax out tarply as
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:15.680]  you know they're only giving attention to weird foundation fake collectivoid
[02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:20.400]  creatures what's going on here in the grand strategy because they are saying
[02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:24.920]  this is the revolution well if it's a George Soros color revolution I'm not
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:29.120]  going to be part of it quite right Alex what we're seeing is the dynamic of the
[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:33.800]  mass strike a sociological process that we've been aware of for you know 100
[02:46:33.800 --> 02:46:38.360]  150 years it simply means that under conditions of economic breakdown and
[02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:42.560]  severe depression which is what we now have there will be forms of mass
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:47.600]  resistant and we saw this in the Tea Party in a certain form at the beginning
[02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:52.960]  it was a kind of a spontaneous protest against the horrors of Obamaism we've
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:57.400]  seen it again now in a much more advanced form in Wisconsin back in
[02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:02.240]  February in Ohio and some degree in Michigan also but mainly the Wisconsin
[02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:07.120]  general strike at the level of the state against this fascist governor in his
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:11.400]  union busting plan but now we're seeing it on an even broader level of course
[02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:15.520]  we've seen it overseas we can talk about some of these models in just a
[02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:19.640]  minute the problem of the mass strike though is it doesn't solve anything it's
[02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:23.760]  an opportunity but it's not a solution and the question is always who will
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:29.520]  provide program leadership organization who will give us a direction who will
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:33.920]  who will propose the measures that are needed because unfortunately after being
[02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:38.280]  stupefied for a number of decades people themselves are not they're not able to
[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:42.080]  come up with and by the way it's now admitted Soros gave five million he's
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:46.520]  running the co-opting of the entire deal and his answer is raise the middle
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:50.320]  class and poor people's taxes to pay it all in banker bailouts to Warren Buffett
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:54.680]  I mean it's it's it's classic yeah it's just crazy I mean he wants to he wants
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:58.040]  to take control of it if you look at the tea party what happened to the tea
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:03.880]  party was the Koch brothers moved in the freedom works moved in Heartland
[02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:07.720]  Institute moved in a whole bunch of these right-wing reactionary think tanks
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:12.520]  moved in and they domesticated the the tea party till it became the right wing
[02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:16.840]  of the Republican election campaign similarly today when we look at there
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:20.160]  are two things going on right what is occupied Wall Street in New York there's
[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:24.760]  going to be one here in Washington called October 2011 no no no the mainstream
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:29.240]  media got behind it it's everywhere it's Austin it's Dallas it's in the people
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:33.000]  that are actually behind this because these these things present themselves as
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:37.040]  leaderless groups but unfortunately they're not in New York the subs the
[02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:42.640]  substructure of this is essentially the soloist group of foundations the FBI you
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:47.840]  and acorn so that's the left wing of the Obama campaign here in Washington DC we
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:53.520]  have David Swanson and Kevin Zeese these are two bitter enemies of 9-11 truth
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:58.200]  left over from the effort by the foundations to keep the 9-11 movement
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:03.680]  and the peace movement separate in in in previous years so there's a very heavy
[02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:08.240]  degree of misleadership but there are just a lot of left liberal mush heads
[02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:12.760]  running around people who are trying to promote themselves you see Michael Moore
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:17.720]  moving in now the couple of things about what your previous guest was saying
[02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:22.720]  the program is what counts but the program of saying down with you know
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:27.880]  mr. X down with some person this is absolutely futile and pointless and I'm
[02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:32.920]  really sorry we need to say abolish the Fed restore free credit of the
[02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:36.360]  government to the population a turbo charge and we're out of the depression
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:40.760]  well I would think you this is a complex society so you need something more
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:44.240]  than that but okay let's look just because people are constantly fighting
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:49.800]  of this Arab Spring Egypt is a failure they got rid of Mubarak but they're
[02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:54.560]  worse off now than they were Tunis is also a failure because they got rid of
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:58.440]  Ben Ali and now that's the thing it's confirmed that the West knew that was
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:01.680]  about to be a rebellion because of commodity prices yeah so they just came
[02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:05.440]  in and triggered it same things happening here yeah at Greece you look at
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:10.360]  Greece they've had 12 general strikes they can't even get rid of Papandreou the
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:16.240]  main IMF and NATO agent and Spain this is the most pathetic Spain we have the
[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:20.480]  indignados so they go into the square in Madrid and they stay there they got
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:25.200]  absolutely nothing they couldn't even get rid of Zapatero they couldn't they
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:30.160]  they accomplished absolute zero but the indignados are the ones that the kids in
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:33.800]  New York say that they're imitating and what they're imitating is this process
[02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:37.880]  of general assemblies this group think where they say oh we do everything by
[02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:41.680]  consensus this is a straight jacket which means they they never do anything
[02:50:41.680 --> 02:50:46.160]  they deliberate for two hours about what to order for lunch but they're totally
[02:50:46.160 --> 02:50:50.720]  incapable of putting forward a single programmatic demand no they put you
[02:50:50.720 --> 02:50:56.640]  into the process itself led by saboteurs the CIA as you know Webster wrote
[02:50:56.640 --> 02:51:01.000]  handbooks on this exactly and I would also point to the the Albert Einstein
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:04.600]  Institute in Jean Sharp of Cambridge, Massachusetts who hold well here's the
[02:51:04.600 --> 02:51:07.560]  deal Webster I want to have you on the nightly nose tonight if you can do it
[02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:10.080]  so you can really put all this forward I'm gonna give you the floor for a few
[02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:13.600]  more minutes here but obviously we need to do a Skype interview with them to do
[02:51:13.600 --> 02:51:18.520]  it anytime because I want you to be able to show the article show the faces you
[02:51:18.520 --> 02:51:23.160]  know send us any quick email of any faces or articles you want us to show we
[02:51:23.160 --> 02:51:26.200]  gotta turn it around pretty quick to get the stuff together for the interview
[02:51:26.200 --> 02:51:31.600]  tonight seven o'clock but what's there listen what do you think of my idea and
[02:51:31.600 --> 02:51:34.760]  I'm we're launching it to go and demonstrate directly at the Federal
[02:51:34.760 --> 02:51:39.160]  Reserve directly at the oligarch command base I think it's a fun idea and I
[02:51:39.160 --> 02:51:43.560]  applaud the idea that you want to get your followers get your get your audience
[02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:47.720]  mobilized because I'm trying to do that on my own radio show world crisis radio
[02:51:47.720 --> 02:51:52.280]  because it's the time now to intervene in these things but intervene means you
[02:51:52.280 --> 02:51:57.040]  go in with a sense of program and and orientation that a lot of these people
[02:51:57.040 --> 02:52:00.680]  don't have I would propose a couple of points right you look at the students
[02:52:00.680 --> 02:52:04.240]  because these are mostly recent college students I get the impression the people
[02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:08.720]  in New York are they're so young that they were not around to be duped by Obama
[02:52:08.720 --> 02:52:14.160]  or they they just caught on with the tail end of Obama ism one of the things
[02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:18.480]  that that brings them together is they're all crushed by student loan debt
[02:52:18.480 --> 02:52:22.920]  they have fifty seventy five a hundred a hundred and fifty thousand of student
[02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:27.080]  loan debt at very high interest rates now this is going to crush the the future
[02:52:27.080 --> 02:52:31.600]  of the United States so one very obvious demand that I would lead with in terms
[02:52:31.600 --> 02:52:36.720]  of intervening in Wall Street and similar groups there a full amnesty on
[02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:41.200]  student loan debt this is about one trillion dollars some of its insured by
[02:52:41.200 --> 02:52:46.040]  the government by by Sally May but some of it's not I think well by the way I
[02:52:46.040 --> 02:52:50.040]  don't want to hear this is socialism or something because here's the deal we
[02:52:50.040 --> 02:52:54.600]  gave sixteen point six trillion to foreign banks and then some and then the
[02:52:54.600 --> 02:52:58.280]  conservatives always tell me how great this is my point is they destroyed our
[02:52:58.280 --> 02:53:01.960]  economy like Ron Paul has said you can't get rid of Social Security and
[02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:05.360]  Medicare and Medicaid right away you've got to phase it into new systems the
[02:53:05.360 --> 02:53:09.360]  globalists want to just cut everything off now and then pile all their fake
[02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:13.560]  debt on us that's like shooting a person in cardiac arrest eight times in the
[02:53:13.560 --> 02:53:17.040]  head with a shotgun we've got to jumpstart things now
[02:53:17.040 --> 02:53:21.920]  yeah so again the twin demands that I think would be a leading edge of this
[02:53:21.920 --> 02:53:25.160]  is for the for the people involved in the Wall Street demonstration that you
[02:53:25.160 --> 02:53:30.360]  see student loan amnesty freeze it you can cancel it you can freeze it you can
[02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:34.240]  freeze it for five or ten years or for the duration of the world economic
[02:53:34.240 --> 02:53:37.840]  depression whichever lasts longer and make that into a political question later
[02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:42.680]  on but this is just crazy what's being done they used to be the National Defense
[02:53:42.680 --> 02:53:46.640]  Education Act you could go to college without coming out with this cursing
[02:53:46.640 --> 02:53:51.480]  burden if you want to know how to pay for these things it's the Wall Street sales
[02:53:51.480 --> 02:53:57.680]  tax it's the 1% tax on Wall Street sales and turnover especially derivatives
[02:53:57.680 --> 02:54:04.520]  there's buying and selling 3.3 quadrillion of derivatives per year that's
[02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:09.720]  the turnover there's 1.5 quadrillion of derivatives in existence at any given
[02:54:09.720 --> 02:54:14.200]  time but they're constantly buying and selling them so basically every every
[02:54:14.200 --> 02:54:19.360]  derivative turns over at least one time per year a 1% tax on that well if you
[02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:23.840]  do the arithmetic you get into trillions of dollars of of income for the federal
[02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:27.720]  government another thing but the idea that when you talk to a group of these
[02:54:27.720 --> 02:54:31.320]  students you got to say look you got to bring in new groups you can't just be a
[02:54:31.320 --> 02:54:35.200]  student rebellion that has no hope you got to bring in the broad middle class
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:39.840]  what's their problem fraud closures foreclosures we know that Bank of America
[02:54:39.840 --> 02:54:46.920]  has robo cops robo judges robo signers and robo foreclosures they're stealing
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:49.960]  the homes of people who never had a webster we've got to end it here but
[02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:53.160]  you're back on tonight for about 10 15 minutes I'll give you the floor then to
[02:54:53.160 --> 02:54:57.720]  a go over who's behind the fake revolution and then be your ideas for
[02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:01.600]  solutions but absolutely there are occupations going on a Bank of America
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:06.840]  who does feel homes and the media is giving it almost no attention again
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:11.040]  notice they're giving must-have communists attention to then scare
[02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:16.440]  mainline Americans away to run to Wall Street well my gosh I don't like Wall
[02:55:16.440 --> 02:55:21.120]  Street but if commies are coming I better join with the bankers and meanwhile
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:24.640]  the bankers are the ones funding the people to make the stupid communist
[02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:29.120]  statements right and you can see also one of the leading figures of the thing
[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:32.720]  that's going to come together here in Washington on Thursday and they claim
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:39.200]  they're gonna go on you know open into two Van Jones Van Jones was a czar in
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:44.000]  the Obama White House right this is the guy who's he signed some 9-11 document
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:47.240]  right at some point in his life and they they had you know they you know that was
[02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:51.000]  a Cass Sunstein set up to I've looked at that that whole thing is a setup but
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:56.840]  this it couldn't be clearer the the Obama reelection strategy presupposes a
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:56:00.280]  left-wing version of the Tea Party where you get a bunch of people out
[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:05.320]  protesting you co-opt them you round them up you keep them vague you keep them
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:09.320]  impotent you keep them disorganized and then you basically say well they're
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:14.120]  out there demanding freedom and equity quality and justice and that's okay
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:19.000]  2012 that's what they were sure out of time tonight 7 o'clock I'll be there
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:23.520]  info wars nightly news when we put you on hold so Jaren can and so do can line
[02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:26.320]  up exactly when we're gonna do that interview I might do it live but I
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:29.440]  you probably want to do it tape so cuz I want to just lay out exactly what's
[02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:33.320]  behind it what their strategy is this is the birth of the left-leaning Tea
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:37.120]  Party that calls for communism to steal the money from old ladies and freeze
[02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:42.400]  colas and social security and pay it to George Soros so that's all coming up
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:46.400]  tonight 7 o'clock look I never even got through this article today can you
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:50.120]  document cam shot this this is the type of treason I'm talking about folks
[02:56:50.120 --> 02:56:56.280]  daily mail Cameron defies e referendum push and insist I think we should stay
[02:56:56.280 --> 02:57:00.720]  in England has been put in this never being allowed to vote and now the euro
[02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:03.720]  is saying they'll pay unlimited trillions to foreign banks it's an
[02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:09.440]  economic dictatorship and this demon David Cameron will not let the Brits
[02:57:09.440 --> 02:57:14.080]  even have a vote you know why cuz it's 80 plus percent in every poll 87 82
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:18.640]  depending on the poll it's in the 80s I mean this is dictatorship and he's like
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:22.280]  I'm a traitor I'm handing England over to this you same things happening in
[02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:25.680]  Europe they don't even say it's for the poor people there are communism they
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:28.320]  say we're gonna have total implosion of everything if you don't pay everything
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:31.800]  you got to the bankers and the military stand about to knock your teeth out and

[03:00:09.880 --> 03:00:13.120]  Alex Jones
[03:00:14.320 --> 03:00:17.920]  alright final five minutes with Ted Anderson I meant to get him on earlier
[03:00:17.920 --> 03:00:23.560]  just forgot to call him online it says the two silver dollars the American
[03:00:23.560 --> 03:00:28.880]  Dream DVD film and the big brother or William nightmare come true is 78 but I
[03:00:28.880 --> 03:00:33.000]  guess Ted saying if you call the toll free number you can get it for 73 the
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:41.880]  number is 800-686-2237 800-686-2237 or they may not have just adjusted these
[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:45.720]  internet specials that are linked up at the top of info wars.com you can see
[03:00:45.720 --> 03:00:51.600]  that buy two coins get two free gifts free and the shipping 78-73 it's all a
[03:00:51.600 --> 03:00:57.360]  good deal there I wanted to bring Ted back up because Ted you know we've got a
[03:00:57.360 --> 03:01:00.840]  bunch of people I just saw one of the signs on info wars when the protesters
[03:01:00.840 --> 03:01:05.680]  one of the pre-made signs by the Soros people that says a job is the right
[03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:10.080]  capitalism doesn't work well we've gotten now 97 years of a banking
[03:01:10.080 --> 03:01:13.280]  dictatorship but they didn't have full controls in the last decade or so we're
[03:01:13.280 --> 03:01:17.800]  living under new world order now insider garbage private bankers who are waging
[03:01:17.800 --> 03:01:23.440]  war against the free market Ted and we've got to get out of the Federal Reserve
[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:28.080]  buildings and identify the real enemy so that the communist working for Soros
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:32.560]  can't play the part of the opposition to then raise our taxes and pay it to his
[03:01:32.560 --> 03:01:38.360]  greedy butt yeah you're right about that I mean really clearly Soros is a is a
[03:01:38.360 --> 03:01:43.120]  central banker supporter and the central banks are what are driving this
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:46.640]  country down into the toilet God they love laughing at their idiot supporters
[03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:49.960]  can you imagine the way they roll talking about these people well you know and I
[03:01:49.960 --> 03:01:53.680]  have these arguments with even people in my own family I'm like that you know
[03:01:53.680 --> 03:01:57.200]  they for whatever reason they think it's a good idea they put Warren Buffett up
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:02:02.040]  there going gee I'm exempt from taxes that ain't right he is on record helping
[03:02:02.040 --> 03:02:05.840]  right the loopholes man these guys aren't multi-billionaires because they
[03:02:05.840 --> 03:02:10.760]  like they play deadly winks they're con artists buckets of pus yeah you're right
[03:02:10.760 --> 03:02:14.600]  about that and and there's this opposition from either side and and I
[03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:17.840]  got to tell you right now the reason why we're having trouble right now is
[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:21.040]  because we have to go into debt just to have money to trade for commerce and
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:26.480]  now we're up to debt too far then we can even handle the pay and you know so
[03:02:26.480 --> 03:02:31.600]  what do you do you you you you've rally up the crowds and you say hey job having
[03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:34.760]  a job is a right well it's not a right you got to go out and work for you got
[03:02:34.760 --> 03:02:37.880]  to earn your living now you might get a job in a gulag under a thing where it's
[03:02:37.880 --> 03:02:41.240]  a right to be a slave for the commies while they live in lavish palaces now
[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:48.800]  Ted in closing charity starts at home you bought a ton load you know what done
[03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:55.760]  of of gold and silver back when went to this low gold is now got up 60 70 bucks
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:02:59.000]  from where it was silver three four bucks or even more in fact give us those
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:02.200]  numbers and tell folks a list of specials okay great it's great to get two
[03:03:02.200 --> 03:03:05.680]  silver dollars and two free gifts that's a great deal but you got a lot of other
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:09.120]  gold and silver what are your best deals you got two minutes list at all yeah
[03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:15.120]  sure well American Eagles right now at 1775 30 British sovereigns are at 454
[03:03:15.120 --> 03:03:18.920]  British the Frank coin which would give away a full year subscription to Bob's
[03:03:18.920 --> 03:03:24.640]  Chapman's newsletters 362 I mean there's a long list of different things I have
[03:03:24.640 --> 03:03:29.840]  walking Liberty haves right now at $15 I really like that campaign for Liberty
[03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:33.800]  coin you want to support Ron Paul pick up those they're in a leatherette case
[03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:38.400]  they're proof a beautiful coin there's only about 200 of them left in the
[03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:42.760]  entire supply then they'll be gone you can't get them anymore and you know so
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:45.800]  if you want to take advantage of a something that that's a quarter of an
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:49.600]  ounce gold coin and and and you're helping the cause I mean there's just
[03:03:49.600 --> 03:03:54.640]  right now whatever you're picking up whether if it's the survival bags of
[03:03:54.640 --> 03:03:58.600]  dimes or you know you name it I mean right now if you're getting into the
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:02.080]  gold and silver market you're taking advantage of a time where the market's
[03:04:02.080 --> 03:04:06.160]  been kicked down by the central bankers they've they're the ones who decided to
[03:04:06.160 --> 03:04:10.920]  raise the reserve requirements by the way Ted I should add JP Morgan is still
[03:04:10.920 --> 03:04:15.640]  saying 2,500 by December now whether that happens or not the point is we know
[03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:19.920]  they're globally devaluing currencies I use these depths as times to buy I know
[03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:24.160]  I've done that and I think it's the best move out there but regardless Ted's
[03:04:24.160 --> 03:04:29.040]  never seen this type of phone calls coming in people are really getting it
[03:04:29.040 --> 03:04:34.960]  now and understand it so the real market is higher than what they say it is on
[03:04:34.960 --> 03:04:38.640]  the news so we're really seeing that manipulation to get revealed here's the
[03:04:38.640 --> 03:04:46.080]  number to call 800 686 2237 1800 686 2237 and the
[03:04:46.080 --> 03:04:51.280]  haul tree profit that Ted makes on this I guess to support the network 800 686
