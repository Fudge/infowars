[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is March 19th, 2017, we're live, I'm gonna have to air several
[00:12.000 --> 00:15.920]  special reports in the first hour as I'm working on a story that's so big, plus these are powerful
[00:15.920 --> 00:20.600]  special reports, including a CIA whistleblower on the surveillance of Trump.
[00:20.600 --> 00:26.480]  But it turns out in public admitted databases of illegal NSA spying that the EFF Foundation
[00:26.480 --> 00:31.840]  and others have looked into, that Sheriff Orpio, outgoing sheriff and his chief detective
[00:31.840 --> 00:37.400]  on the cold case, Zulu's joining us later, went through it and guess who's in it?
[00:37.400 --> 00:41.280]  That's right, Donald Trump being surveilled by Obama, hiding in plain view.
[00:41.280 --> 00:42.280]  Oh, and myself too.
[00:42.280 --> 00:45.560]  First, a John Bowne report, stay with us.
[00:45.560 --> 00:50.920]  German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the White House today to discuss shared economic
[00:50.920 --> 00:54.120]  goals between the United States and Germany.
[00:54.120 --> 00:57.400]  The talks began cordially enough.
[00:57.400 --> 01:04.520]  Chancellor Merkel, it is a great honor to welcome you to the People's House, the White
[01:04.520 --> 01:05.520]  House.
[01:05.520 --> 01:12.080]  I also appreciate Chancellor Merkel's leadership along with the French president to resolve
[01:12.080 --> 01:20.720]  the conflict in Ukraine, where we ideally seek a peaceful solution.
[01:20.720 --> 01:27.560]  Most importantly, our two countries must continue to work together to protect our people from
[01:27.560 --> 01:34.680]  radical Islamic terrorism and to defeat ISIS.
[01:34.680 --> 01:41.040]  I applaud Chancellor Merkel for Germany's contributions, both civilian and military,
[01:41.040 --> 01:44.920]  as a counter-ISIS coalition member.
[01:44.920 --> 01:50.160]  We also recognize that immigration security is national security.
[01:50.160 --> 01:57.320]  We must protect our citizens from those who seek to spread terrorism, extremism and violence
[01:57.320 --> 02:00.080]  inside our borders.
[02:00.080 --> 02:03.880]  Immigration is a privilege, not a right.
[02:03.880 --> 02:10.840]  And the safety of our citizens must always come first, without question.
[02:10.840 --> 02:16.120]  But when the topic shifted to the civil war of fake news plaguing the success of Donald
[02:16.120 --> 02:22.440]  Trump's staggering agenda, well, Merkel chose to embrace a globalist tone rather than the
[02:22.440 --> 02:27.280]  populist nationalism sweeping parts of Europe and the United States.
[02:27.280 --> 02:31.520]  We have a tremendous group of people that listen and I can get around the media when
[02:31.520 --> 02:34.520]  the media doesn't tell the truth, so I like that.
[02:34.520 --> 02:41.800]  As far as wiretapping, I guess, by, you know, this past administration, at least we have
[02:41.800 --> 02:46.800]  something in common, perhaps.
[02:46.800 --> 02:54.240]  Well, how dangerous do you think this isolationist policy of the U.S. President is what was
[02:54.240 --> 02:59.400]  the import terrorist that he plans and also with the fact that he doesn't think the
[02:59.400 --> 03:03.640]  EU doesn't deal with the DU in a very respectful way.
[03:03.640 --> 03:08.480]  And Mr. President, America first, don't you think that this is going to weaken also the
[03:08.480 --> 03:09.480]  European Union?
[03:09.480 --> 03:14.960]  Why are you so scared of diversity in the news?
[03:14.960 --> 03:16.360]  Nice friendly reporter.
[03:16.360 --> 03:24.040]  First of all, I don't believe in an isolationist policy, but I also believe a policy of trade
[03:24.040 --> 03:26.080]  should be a fair policy.
[03:26.080 --> 03:31.200]  And the United States has been treated very, very unfairly by many countries over the years,
[03:31.200 --> 03:32.680]  and that's going to stop.
[03:32.680 --> 03:34.120]  But I'm not an isolationist.
[03:34.120 --> 03:37.120]  I'm a free trader, but I'm also a fair trader.
[03:37.120 --> 03:41.000]  The success of Germans have always been one where the German success is one side of the
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.800]  coin, and the other side of the coin has been European unity and European integration.
[03:46.800 --> 03:50.680]  That's something of which I'm deeply convinced, and I'm not only saying this back home, I'm
[03:50.680 --> 03:57.960]  saying this here, and secondly, I believe that globalization ought to be shaped in an
[03:57.960 --> 04:00.920]  open-minded way, but also in a very fair way.
[04:00.920 --> 04:05.320]  Freedom of movement within the European Union, for example, is a very important element of
[04:05.320 --> 04:09.960]  economic progress of peace, has been for many, many decades.
[04:09.960 --> 04:15.040]  The European countries, for many, many centuries, wage wars against each other.
[04:15.040 --> 04:21.080]  Traffic has to be stopped, but this has to be done by looking at the refugees as well,
[04:21.080 --> 04:26.760]  giving them opportunities to shape their own lives where they are, help countries who right
[04:26.760 --> 04:31.560]  now are not in an ability to do so, sometimes because they have civil war.
[04:31.560 --> 04:34.280]  I think that's the right way of going about it.
[04:34.280 --> 04:37.640]  And this is obviously what we have an exchange of views about.
[04:37.640 --> 04:42.400]  President Trump stood strong in the face of globalist rhetoric, at this point indifferent
[04:42.400 --> 04:48.520]  to the throngs of leftist propaganda stooges lobbing their curveballs at the Trump administration
[04:48.520 --> 04:54.040]  agenda, a little lesson to the globalists visiting the people's house in the future.
[04:54.040 --> 04:56.120]  This is our house, not yours.
[04:56.120 --> 05:01.640]  John Baum for Infowars.com.
[05:01.640 --> 05:04.840]  This is Ashley Beckford for Infowars.com.
[05:04.840 --> 05:10.840]  This is your tip of the week, article for Merkola.com, fluoride the only drug intentionally
[05:10.840 --> 05:13.240]  added to your tap water.
[05:13.240 --> 05:19.120]  Fluoride is an endocrine disrupting neurotoxic and bone weakening substance that the FDA defines
[05:19.120 --> 05:24.440]  as a drug when used to prevent disease, because unlike the minerals we need, humans have no
[05:24.440 --> 05:28.240]  known physiological requirement for fluoride.
[05:28.240 --> 05:33.480]  Sodium fluoride long known as an effective roach poison is added to tablets and drops
[05:33.480 --> 05:36.080]  for the purpose of preventing tooth decay.
[05:36.080 --> 05:41.520]  In short, sodium fluoride is not a nutritional supplement, it is a prescription drug and
[05:41.520 --> 05:42.760]  a dangerous one.
[05:42.760 --> 05:49.200]  FDA recently announced that marketing fluoride drops and tablets for cavity prevention violates
[05:49.200 --> 05:55.080]  federal law because FDA never approved these products as either safe or effective.
[05:55.080 --> 06:04.160]  To use fluoride, use the Alexa pure water filter to remove contaminants from your water supply.
[06:04.160 --> 06:09.760]  You have the power, humanity has the power, we have the power, do you want to fight, you
[06:09.760 --> 06:14.360]  better believe, you got one!
[06:14.360 --> 06:19.520]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[06:19.520 --> 06:36.480]  It's Sunday, March 19, 2017, I'm your host, Alex Jones, thank you for joining us on this
[06:36.480 --> 06:37.920]  Sunday Worldwide Broadcast.
[06:37.920 --> 06:43.480]  Now, if you just joined us, I did the short segment earlier, some stations join us here
[06:43.480 --> 06:48.360]  in the second segment, I began to break down some of the massive news that we're about
[06:48.360 --> 06:53.440]  to break in the second hour of this broadcast today, some of the biggest news we've broken
[06:53.440 --> 07:00.640]  in a long, long time, and we've broken other big stories like a hit and run, what appeared
[07:00.640 --> 07:06.600]  to be attempted murder of Roger Stone earlier this week, it's finally in the Miami newspapers
[07:06.600 --> 07:11.360]  and broadcast television today that indeed the police are investigating it as that.
[07:11.360 --> 07:15.400]  Or when we get secret documents that Homeland Security says that veterans, gun owners and
[07:15.400 --> 07:19.800]  Christians and conservatives are the number one threat to America, people didn't believe
[07:19.800 --> 07:23.760]  us for a week until Janet Napolitano came out and said, yeah, that's a real training
[07:23.760 --> 07:27.480]  manual, we stand by it.
[07:27.480 --> 07:31.400]  Obviously when we had Colonel Schaefer on, very respected, but we had him on less than
[07:31.400 --> 07:36.760]  a week after Benghazi, and he laid it out exactly what it took three years later for
[07:36.760 --> 07:38.360]  the information to come out.
[07:38.360 --> 07:42.720]  There are so many hundreds of examples of us breaking big national news here over and
[07:42.720 --> 07:48.080]  over again, like the fact that Hillary Clinton was falling down, having convulsions every
[07:48.080 --> 07:54.520]  45 minutes or so, and then she was caught two weeks after I said that, on air, in a
[07:54.520 --> 07:59.280]  medical tent, reportedly collapsed for 45 minutes, and then the media made fun of us
[07:59.280 --> 08:04.520]  saying that, and one week later on 9-11, she collapsed in front of the world, and the media
[08:04.520 --> 08:08.280]  would only show her shaking about to fall, and would you show her actually falling on
[08:08.280 --> 08:13.680]  her face, and would say we made that up, hoping you didn't go look online and see the full
[08:13.680 --> 08:21.680]  video that we broke down and reported on that Drudge Report put out to the entire planet.
[08:21.680 --> 08:26.320]  So we break a lot of massive news here.
[08:26.320 --> 08:33.640]  Now, I knew about this database last week, I reported on the existence of it years ago,
[08:33.640 --> 08:38.000]  but we have obviously law enforcement sources that are very respected that were giving the
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.240]  data and information to outgoing Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, good friends with
[08:43.240 --> 08:52.040]  President Trump, and also fearless, and his chief cold case investigator, Mike Zula, who
[08:52.040 --> 08:56.680]  has massive contacts on the East Coast, obviously, where he previously worked in law enforcement.
[08:56.680 --> 09:02.880]  We're going to go with this tomorrow with Arpaio and Zula, but because of security
[09:02.880 --> 09:04.200]  issues, we just want to get it out now.
[09:04.200 --> 09:11.720]  I'm leaving at that, and sooner couldn't be better, because this is big.
[09:11.720 --> 09:16.040]  Now part of this is an admitted database and a program that was reported on by the Electronic
[09:16.040 --> 09:23.200]  Frontier Foundation, very respected, the London Guardian and others.
[09:23.200 --> 09:28.000]  When I saw the final draft this afternoon, I called Corsi and I called Mirkel Phelan,
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.480]  who's our hacking internet specialist, and I said, I want to add a lot of stuff to this
[09:31.480 --> 09:36.040]  article that's background, that they admittedly in the New York Times and Washington Post in
[09:36.040 --> 09:41.840]  January said they were spying on President-elect and President Trump with intercepts, wiretaps,
[09:41.840 --> 09:42.840]  you name it.
[09:42.840 --> 09:43.840]  Then they tried to walk that back.
[09:43.840 --> 09:44.960]  We're going to cover that today.
[09:44.960 --> 09:51.080]  I said, I want that added into some context, and I want added into context that the Senate
[09:51.080 --> 09:55.080]  Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee was spied on by the CIA five years
[09:55.080 --> 09:56.080]  ago.
[09:56.080 --> 09:57.080]  Remember that huge controversy?
[09:57.080 --> 10:02.720]  And CIA spied on Senate Intelligence Committee.
[10:02.720 --> 10:03.720]  Just type it in for yourself.
[10:03.720 --> 10:05.000]  In fact, I printed that Friday.
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.880]  We reprint that and pull it out of my stack, because they just act like none of this is
[10:07.880 --> 10:09.760]  happening when it is happening.
[10:09.760 --> 10:14.600]  But we have the actual law enforcement NSA database.
[10:14.600 --> 10:21.320]  Now the reason we have this is state police, the DEA, the FBI and others.
[10:21.320 --> 10:22.320]  There's London Guardian.
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.880]  The Constitutional Crisis, the CIA turns on the Senate, openly spying on them domestically
[10:27.880 --> 10:30.440]  because they were worried about their budget.
[10:30.440 --> 10:31.440]  That's illegal.
[10:31.440 --> 10:32.440]  Print that for me.
[10:32.440 --> 10:33.440]  Thank you.
[10:33.440 --> 10:36.880]  That's September 2016, but that came out five years ago that was first happening.
[10:36.880 --> 10:41.120]  So they give access to these databases.
[10:41.120 --> 10:44.440]  In fact, print me the article out of the Associated Press three years ago.
[10:44.440 --> 10:53.120]  A headline is parallel construction, DEA involved in parallel construction, Yahoo News as well.
[10:53.120 --> 10:55.560]  That's where they have the NSA database for spying on people.
[10:55.560 --> 11:00.920]  But they can't use the NSA database domestically, so they have to go rebuild the case with the
[11:00.920 --> 11:01.920]  info they already have.
[11:01.920 --> 11:03.240]  I mean, they know you're a drug dealer.
[11:03.240 --> 11:04.520]  They know what you're doing.
[11:04.520 --> 11:05.520]  They know who you're supplying.
[11:05.520 --> 11:06.960]  They know what you're up to.
[11:06.960 --> 11:08.160]  Or maybe they're going to set you up.
[11:08.160 --> 11:09.160]  Maybe not.
[11:09.160 --> 11:14.360]  Maybe they're putting false info on the database as the new Vault 7 CIA WikiLeaks shows where
[11:14.360 --> 11:17.200]  they're framing Russia and others.
[11:17.200 --> 11:20.840]  Communist China is being used to frame Russia for, quote, us.
[11:20.840 --> 11:21.840]  That's the globalist.
[11:21.840 --> 11:24.120]  Oh, America's pretty much run by the Communist Chinese right now.
[11:24.120 --> 11:26.800]  It's truly sickening.
[11:26.800 --> 11:28.960]  Our elites have sold us out to them.
[11:28.960 --> 11:32.840]  They're the ones from North Korea and then threatening to nuke the US.
[11:32.840 --> 11:33.840]  Yeah, there it is.
[11:33.840 --> 11:34.840]  Reuters.
[11:34.840 --> 11:35.840]  Exclusive.
[11:35.840 --> 11:38.560]  US directs agents to cover up programs used to investigate Americans.
[11:38.560 --> 11:40.680]  Print me that solid gold.
[11:40.680 --> 11:45.880]  So what's happening here is, as the head guide info wars, I don't really act as an editor.
[11:45.880 --> 11:46.880]  Paul Watson does.
[11:46.880 --> 11:51.200]  And so does Dr. Corsi on his own pieces in our Washington Bureau.
[11:51.200 --> 11:52.200]  But I saw his article.
[11:52.200 --> 11:53.200]  It was so powerful.
[11:53.200 --> 11:56.320]  I said, listen, you're going to have to not give up sources here, but they already know
[11:56.320 --> 11:58.040]  how you're getting this.
[11:58.040 --> 11:59.040]  This is no secret.
[11:59.040 --> 12:01.440]  This is from state police, DEA, things like that.
[12:01.440 --> 12:03.320]  I'm going to stop right there.
[12:03.320 --> 12:09.360]  So they're able to get into the database of who's already been spotted on without a warrant
[12:09.360 --> 12:14.760]  in these quote, dragnet operations, NSA files decoded, Edward Snowden surveillance revelations
[12:14.760 --> 12:21.840]  explained, dragnet, NSA spying survives 2015 review, electronic frontier foundation.
[12:21.840 --> 12:22.840]  Very respected.
[12:22.840 --> 12:25.080]  What's the news we've got?
[12:25.080 --> 12:28.720]  And I'm holding publishing this till next hour till we've added all these links.
[12:28.720 --> 12:30.120]  Because of course, Corsi is the type of journalist.
[12:30.120 --> 12:34.720]  He just gives you our breaking report, our info that's bombshell.
[12:34.720 --> 12:38.280]  But I want when the media tries to pick it apart, I want to have all the other admissions
[12:38.280 --> 12:42.480]  of, oh, they were ordered to illegally cover up their illegal, you know, activities in
[12:42.480 --> 12:43.480]  America.
[12:43.480 --> 12:44.480]  Oh, they're spying on everybody.
[12:44.480 --> 12:46.000]  Oh, here's London Guardian.
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.000]  Oh, here's Reuters.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.480]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, here's the Senate committee admitting it.
[12:49.480 --> 12:53.080]  Oh, oh, oh, how's that feel?
[12:53.080 --> 13:01.600]  Before we give you the big enchilada, we've not just received the data of the dragnet.
[13:01.600 --> 13:07.880]  Our law enforcement services, who are patriots in many cases, have given our sources who
[13:07.880 --> 13:13.680]  are impeccable the database excerpts.
[13:13.680 --> 13:14.680]  And we have them.
[13:14.680 --> 13:17.680]  And by the way, we could be SWAT team rated any minute for this.
[13:17.680 --> 13:19.840]  But again, we have President Trump now who wants law and order.
[13:19.840 --> 13:21.720]  So there's still criminal elements in the government.
[13:21.720 --> 13:22.720]  We don't know what's going to happen.
[13:22.720 --> 13:25.160]  This is all done in the interest of the Republic on the truth.
[13:25.160 --> 13:32.520]  We have President Trump being surveilled by Obama, previous to even running for the presidency.
[13:32.520 --> 13:36.440]  And then it cuts off and the rest has not been put in the database since then for these
[13:36.440 --> 13:38.160]  law enforcement groups.
[13:38.160 --> 13:43.040]  We only have the database up until 2015.
[13:43.040 --> 13:52.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got Barack Obama spying on the Trump kids, the Trump wife, particular
[13:52.920 --> 13:54.720]  interest in the Trump's daughter.
[13:54.720 --> 13:58.800]  Oh, and guess who else is in the database?
[13:58.800 --> 14:02.400]  Got him, Alex Jones.
[14:02.400 --> 14:09.120]  My private cell phone number, our little shadow office, all of it is in there.
[14:09.120 --> 14:10.120]  So very interesting.
[14:10.120 --> 14:14.200]  And I'm getting calls by these law enforcement guys and they're like, yeah, is this your
[14:14.200 --> 14:15.200]  number?
[14:15.200 --> 14:16.200]  Is this your address?
[14:16.200 --> 14:17.200]  Yeah.
[14:17.200 --> 14:18.200]  I'm like, of course it's my number.
[14:18.200 --> 14:19.200]  You're talking to me on it.
[14:19.200 --> 14:23.280]  And I guess they just went live with it.
[14:23.280 --> 14:25.120]  You know, that's fine.
[14:25.120 --> 14:29.440]  But I talked to them an hour ago and 30 months ago and 15 months ago, if I went on air and
[14:29.440 --> 14:33.720]  I said, wait, because I want to add all that, but it's fine.
[14:33.720 --> 14:36.440]  It's down going live on info wars.com.
[14:36.440 --> 14:39.440]  And we're going to add some of the background to that information.
[14:39.440 --> 14:43.440]  But we also probably clip out this little segment of the live show and add this into
[14:43.440 --> 14:44.440]  the piece.
[14:44.440 --> 14:48.200]  But it explains it and breaks it all down.
[14:48.200 --> 14:53.920]  But we've put this out of there early because of security concern issues, because let's
[14:53.920 --> 15:00.040]  just say behind the scenes, some stuff broke loose once they're obviously listening to
[15:00.040 --> 15:01.040]  our phones.
[15:01.040 --> 15:07.000]  Last week, we were talking about this and with most people, you're just being recorded
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  and it's in a database.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  Then go back to it later.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.800]  When you're talking about Sheriff Orpio or myself or Dr. Corsi who's up there with his
[15:12.800 --> 15:16.840]  nose and everything in DC, they're spying on everybody in real time.
[15:16.840 --> 15:18.720]  And of course, Trump knows it's going on.
[15:18.720 --> 15:19.720]  He's ordering them to stop.
[15:19.720 --> 15:20.720]  They won't stop.
[15:20.720 --> 15:24.960]  People kept saying, Trump's going to learn he was a victim of all this illegal spying
[15:24.960 --> 15:28.640]  and he's going to stand up against it and now it's happening and he's this big champion
[15:28.640 --> 15:29.640]  against it.
[15:29.640 --> 15:33.520]  And the media is trying to act like with the Snowden movie that came out and all the rest
[15:33.520 --> 15:36.640]  of it and all the documents that none of this is true or happening.
[15:36.640 --> 15:39.640]  They make fun of Conway for saying you're applying to spy on you when it's all over
[15:39.640 --> 15:40.640]  the news.
[15:40.640 --> 15:42.800]  That's when the new database dumped.
[15:42.800 --> 15:48.080]  And I'm told more is coming, but this is not from the latest Vault 7.
[15:48.080 --> 15:49.080]  It's not from the other stuff.
[15:49.080 --> 15:55.520]  This is directly from law enforcement to our sources and it's a big, big deal, more breaking
[15:55.520 --> 15:56.520]  straight ahead.
[15:56.520 --> 15:57.520]  I'm Alex Jones.
[15:57.520 --> 16:00.520]  Infowars.com has at least the first portion up.
[16:00.520 --> 16:06.920]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce
[16:06.920 --> 16:10.200]  about a group you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[16:10.200 --> 16:13.640]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[16:13.640 --> 16:15.880]  it's very, very important.
[16:15.880 --> 16:22.480]  The aging process is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[16:22.480 --> 16:24.680]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[16:24.680 --> 16:26.840]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[16:26.840 --> 16:31.160]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[16:31.160 --> 16:34.040]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[16:34.040 --> 16:35.720]  It works like an antioxidant.
[16:35.720 --> 16:38.640]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[16:38.640 --> 16:41.800]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[16:41.800 --> 16:42.840]  It's in powder form.
[16:42.840 --> 16:45.560]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[16:45.560 --> 16:46.560]  I take this.
[16:46.560 --> 16:48.240]  This is the product that I take.
[16:48.240 --> 16:51.040]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[16:51.040 --> 16:52.040]  We fight the global.
[16:52.040 --> 16:53.040]  We fight the new world order.
[16:53.040 --> 17:00.320]  Secure your DNA force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[17:00.320 --> 17:02.200]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[17:02.200 --> 17:04.200]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[17:04.200 --> 17:07.080]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[17:07.080 --> 17:13.120]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[17:13.120 --> 17:18.080]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[17:18.080 --> 17:23.040]  Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[17:23.040 --> 17:28.160]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[17:28.160 --> 17:29.880]  you can to purify your air.
[17:29.880 --> 17:34.920]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[17:34.920 --> 17:37.880]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[17:37.880 --> 17:40.120]  The general public doesn't.
[17:40.120 --> 17:44.040]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[17:44.040 --> 17:47.680]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[17:47.680 --> 17:51.240]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[17:51.240 --> 17:54.440]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[17:54.440 --> 18:02.800]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarsstore.com.
[18:02.800 --> 18:06.680]  The reason infowarslife has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want
[18:06.680 --> 18:08.160]  products I'm going to use for my family.
[18:08.160 --> 18:09.160]  I take this.
[18:09.160 --> 18:10.160]  My family takes this.
[18:10.160 --> 18:13.800]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going
[18:13.800 --> 18:14.800]  to find anywhere.
[18:14.800 --> 18:19.120]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[18:19.120 --> 18:23.680]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[18:23.680 --> 18:24.880]  I don't feel good.
[18:24.880 --> 18:28.520]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[18:28.520 --> 18:31.280]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my super female.
[18:31.280 --> 18:37.360]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[18:37.360 --> 18:43.160]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair is a little luxurious once
[18:43.160 --> 18:44.160]  again.
[18:44.160 --> 18:45.800]  So obviously the super female is amazing.
[18:45.800 --> 18:46.800]  I love it.
[18:46.800 --> 18:49.480]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[18:49.480 --> 18:50.480]  Survival Shield X2.
[18:50.480 --> 18:53.840]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent
[18:53.840 --> 18:58.080]  iodine Survival Shield X2, it's got a five star rating.
[18:58.080 --> 19:02.360]  It's a win-win in infowarslife.com.
[19:02.360 --> 19:07.280]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[19:07.280 --> 19:10.640]  before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[19:10.640 --> 19:15.880]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[19:15.880 --> 19:22.040]  bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom, and seven total primal super foods in a single
[19:22.040 --> 19:23.520]  great tasting formula.
[19:23.520 --> 19:24.520]  Caveman.
[19:24.520 --> 19:28.400]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[19:28.400 --> 19:32.400]  superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[19:32.400 --> 19:35.040]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[19:35.040 --> 19:40.240]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[19:40.240 --> 19:44.560]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces
[19:44.560 --> 19:48.200]  the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[19:48.200 --> 19:52.560]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[19:52.560 --> 19:56.160]  to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[19:56.160 --> 20:00.640]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself in infowarslife.com
[20:00.640 --> 20:04.640]  today.
[20:04.640 --> 20:11.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:34.640 --> 20:57.240]  We've put out the first basic boil down with even more added documentation being added
[20:57.240 --> 21:03.360]  as we speak by Markel Phelan to infowars.com and the story, NSA database documents, NSA
[21:03.360 --> 21:09.200]  electronic surveillance of Donald Trump in Trump Tower and Alex Jones in Texas.
[21:09.200 --> 21:12.840]  Now ladies and gentlemen, these databases, here it is out of the New York Times, in
[21:12.840 --> 21:16.680]  court by CIA affirms, it's spied on Senate panel.
[21:16.680 --> 21:20.200]  Remember that in 2014.
[21:20.200 --> 21:21.200]  There it is.
[21:21.200 --> 21:22.200]  Okay, this goes on.
[21:22.200 --> 21:23.200]  They think you're stupid.
[21:23.200 --> 21:25.440]  And of course, Trump has the same sources we have.
[21:25.440 --> 21:26.440]  He's the president.
[21:26.440 --> 21:27.440]  He knows he's in the databases.
[21:27.440 --> 21:31.160]  He now knows he's been spied on for decades, okay, including by Obama.
[21:31.160 --> 21:33.200]  We have the entries.
[21:33.200 --> 21:37.240]  A constitutional crisis, the CIA turns on the Senate, the London Guardian.
[21:37.240 --> 21:42.520]  So that's the Senate being spied on, exclusive US directs agents to cover up a program used
[21:42.520 --> 21:47.680]  to investigate Americans, Reuters, with illegal NSA databases being given to federal and state
[21:47.680 --> 21:48.680]  law enforcement.
[21:48.680 --> 21:51.200]  CIA accused of spying on US Senate and Toll's committee.
[21:51.200 --> 21:52.200]  Reuters confirmed.
[21:52.200 --> 21:54.320]  Okay, I'm just giving you background here.
[21:54.320 --> 21:58.400]  When they play dumb and say Trump has no proof, he's crazy, and they get all these people
[21:58.400 --> 22:02.920]  in the Senate in the house to say it's so that's because they're desperate.
[22:02.920 --> 22:09.680]  Well, law enforcement has access to these databases of who's been ordered, surveilled,
[22:09.680 --> 22:12.880]  and then who can get access to that surveillance, different agencies.
[22:12.880 --> 22:13.920]  And Donald Trump is in there.
[22:13.920 --> 22:18.640]  You can see where, when, and how, month after month, year after year.
[22:18.640 --> 22:25.680]  It gets cut off a few years ago, but it's got Obama and Bush, W, spying on Donald Trump.
[22:25.680 --> 22:28.920]  Running from 2008 right down.
[22:28.920 --> 22:33.000]  So you want to see it for yourself, the phone numbers, the back of the, and by the way,
[22:33.000 --> 22:34.560]  I've known some of Donald Trump's phone numbers.
[22:34.560 --> 22:35.560]  I'll leave it at that.
[22:35.560 --> 22:36.560]  It's Donald Trump's phone number.
[22:36.560 --> 22:39.400]  I dialed that number.
[22:39.400 --> 22:40.400]  I've got that number.
[22:40.400 --> 22:41.600]  He no longer uses it.
[22:41.600 --> 22:46.680]  Well, one of them is just the direct line of the Trump Tower and into his secretary.
[22:46.680 --> 22:49.080]  But so this is the real deal.
[22:49.080 --> 22:50.560]  And of course, he knows about this.
[22:50.560 --> 22:52.960]  He's friends with our Pio, our Pio.
[22:52.960 --> 22:57.040]  And of course, Mike are looking into all this and doing the investigation.
[22:57.040 --> 23:01.120]  Now, in this segment, the next, because I've got to get off the air, plus this, I was
[23:01.120 --> 23:02.120]  already going to air these clips.
[23:02.120 --> 23:03.920]  They're so important from Friday's show.
[23:03.920 --> 23:07.400]  I've got to go work on this because there's a lot I want to add to the story.
[23:07.400 --> 23:10.560]  I want to add where the DEA admits they're getting illegal stuff from the NSA.
[23:10.560 --> 23:14.120]  I want to have the state police are I want to have them going after journalists with
[23:14.120 --> 23:15.120]  this stuff.
[23:15.120 --> 23:18.440]  I want to add where they're using it for blackmail mainstream news.
[23:18.440 --> 23:19.440]  Now thinks you're dumb.
[23:19.440 --> 23:24.920]  And I want to add screenshots of the New York Times, the 19th of 2021.
[23:24.920 --> 23:29.120]  The reporters at the New York Times on singing and saying, we never heard of this.
[23:29.120 --> 23:30.120]  It's insane.
[23:30.120 --> 23:33.320]  When they wrote articles saying it in the headline.
[23:33.320 --> 23:34.320]  So we've got them here.
[23:34.320 --> 23:38.600]  They're trying to just totally scan everybody like Gruber did with Obamacare saying, thank
[23:38.600 --> 23:39.600]  God, you're so stupid.
[23:39.600 --> 23:41.800]  Well, you're not so stupid.
[23:41.800 --> 23:42.800]  Flashback.
[23:42.800 --> 23:46.320]  New York Times admits that there was wiretapping of President Trump.
[23:46.320 --> 23:51.160]  That's all being added in previous background of the article that just went up on infowars.com
[23:51.160 --> 23:55.200]  that needs to go completely and totally viral.
[23:55.200 --> 23:59.320]  Again, whistleblowing is covered if it's covering illegal information.
[23:59.320 --> 24:02.960]  If you're illegally surveilling Donald Trump, the businessman, and Alex Jones, the radio
[24:02.960 --> 24:13.280]  host slash TV host, his wife, his family for a decade and Obama's part of this on by the
[24:13.280 --> 24:15.760]  way, I told you Friday that Trump had to apologize.
[24:15.760 --> 24:18.400]  There was no statement of that.
[24:18.400 --> 24:21.360]  And then Spicer came out and said, President has apologized, the British, he knows for
[24:21.360 --> 24:24.920]  a fact they use the GSCQ to spy on us and we spy on them.
[24:24.920 --> 24:26.160]  That's part of it.
[24:26.160 --> 24:27.400]  That's admitted.
[24:27.400 --> 24:34.560]  So here is the CIA top level individual also from the State Department, a deputy head of
[24:34.560 --> 24:37.920]  counterterrorism, Larry C. Johnson, used to be a Fox News contributor until he wouldn't
[24:37.920 --> 24:39.920]  show up about this.
[24:39.920 --> 24:43.240]  Coming on the show Friday to break it down in an hour interview, we're gonna have five
[24:43.240 --> 24:46.040]  minutes of it now, five minutes when we come back.
[24:46.040 --> 24:50.480]  And then we're going to break down just how big a deal this is with Obama denying all
[24:50.480 --> 24:51.480]  this.
[24:51.480 --> 24:52.480]  And here it is.
[24:52.480 --> 24:56.280]  They're admitting they were doing it in 2016.
[24:56.280 --> 24:57.280]  Then they tried to deny it.
[24:57.280 --> 25:03.060]  But now we have the actual database documents where they were doing it years before at
[25:03.060 --> 25:05.080]  Trump Tower.
[25:05.080 --> 25:07.000]  And I just can't believe I'm in the database too.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.400]  But isn't that just cute?
[25:08.400 --> 25:12.960]  Well, I mean, I've seen federal court cases where they use stuff from the government
[25:12.960 --> 25:16.240]  database on people they're going after that have been guests of mine and it comes up.
[25:16.240 --> 25:17.720]  So I guess I've seen this before.
[25:17.720 --> 25:19.240]  I mean, we know we're getting surveilled.
[25:19.240 --> 25:22.360]  But my goodness, in there with Donald Trump, but see, they know who to watch folks.
[25:22.360 --> 25:24.080]  They knew who the Patriots are.
[25:24.080 --> 25:25.760]  So let's go ahead and go to this report.
[25:25.760 --> 25:26.760]  They don't want you to see.
[25:26.760 --> 25:30.840]  By the way, this got censored off Facebook when he was first interviewed by RT.
[25:30.840 --> 25:31.840]  Here it is.
[25:31.840 --> 25:38.840]  Donald Trump is in essence correct that the intelligence agencies and some in the law
[25:38.840 --> 25:45.840]  enforcement community on the side of the FBI were in fact illegally trying to access,
[25:45.840 --> 25:51.120]  monitor his communications with his aides and with other people.
[25:51.120 --> 26:04.680]  All of this with an end to trying to destroy and discredit his presidency.
[26:04.680 --> 26:06.560]  You take on the intelligence community.
[26:06.560 --> 26:09.760]  They have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[26:09.760 --> 26:15.040]  So even for a practical supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do
[26:15.040 --> 26:16.040]  this.
[26:16.040 --> 26:19.520]  The real fundamental thing that ought to alarm all Americans, regardless of their political
[26:19.520 --> 26:25.920]  party, their political affiliation, is what has been going on with former leaders of the
[26:25.920 --> 26:32.400]  Central Intelligence Agency and the director of National Intelligence Agency's office
[26:32.400 --> 26:37.080]  is direct interference in the domestic politics.
[26:37.080 --> 26:42.520]  If we're going to talk about Russian meddling in US politics, then needs to be acknowledged
[26:42.520 --> 26:47.680]  that these intelligence agencies or principles at the top were involved with meddling.
[26:47.680 --> 26:50.960]  Now, do I have firsthand knowledge that John Brennan was doing this?
[26:50.960 --> 26:52.760]  No, I do not.
[26:52.760 --> 26:57.360]  I have been told though by someone who is in a position to know, who's still within the
[26:57.360 --> 27:03.600]  intelligence community, that absolutely that's what was going on, that Brennan and that there
[27:03.600 --> 27:09.320]  are shenanigans going on between the GHCQ and US intelligence.
[27:09.320 --> 27:11.320]  How does that work?
[27:11.320 --> 27:18.320]  Your listeners should understand that it is illegal without some warrant for any of the
[27:18.320 --> 27:22.640]  intelligence or law enforcement agencies to collect on American citizens.
[27:22.640 --> 27:28.240]  It is not illegal for the British, through their version of NSA, to collect on American
[27:28.240 --> 27:32.320]  citizens because we're foreigners as far as they're concerned, and we're a legitimate
[27:32.320 --> 27:33.320]  target.
[27:33.320 --> 27:39.920]  Similarly, the United States can really collect on any British citizen because they're not
[27:39.920 --> 27:40.920]  Americans.
[27:40.920 --> 27:42.280]  They don't have the constitutional protection.
[27:42.280 --> 27:44.120]  We all spy on each other then.
[27:44.120 --> 27:45.120]  Yeah.
[27:45.120 --> 27:51.200]  I mean, if anybody's so naive as to think that the Brits aren't spying on Americans and Americans
[27:51.200 --> 27:57.400]  aren't spying on Brits, well, I hate to burst your bubble, but the reality is that's what
[27:57.400 --> 27:59.520]  spy agencies do.
[27:59.520 --> 28:03.000]  They collect and gather intelligence on other entities.
[28:03.000 --> 28:04.000]  That's one of their purposes.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.400]  Well, remember the scandal just four years ago where the CIA was spying on Republicans
[28:08.400 --> 28:11.000]  and Democrats in the Senate, the Intelligence Committee heads?
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  Right.
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.400]  When that was, you know, John Brennan, again, had his fingerprints all over that because
[28:16.400 --> 28:21.920]  they didn't want the information about the torture report to come out, and Brennan initially
[28:21.920 --> 28:26.960]  denied that that was going on and then later had to admit that it had in fact happened.
[28:26.960 --> 28:31.880]  So it's not, you know, we're not raising these allegations without precedent.
[28:31.880 --> 28:38.360]  Director Brennan, in 2014, the CIA conducted an unauthorized search of Senate files, including
[28:38.360 --> 28:43.760]  the emails of Senate staff investigating the CIA's use of torture.
[28:43.760 --> 28:49.760]  The CIA and Spectre General later stated that the search involved improper agency access.
[28:49.760 --> 28:52.920]  All right, folks, we're going to be back after this quick break.
[28:52.920 --> 28:58.720]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, major news on the illegal NSA spying on Donald Trump by Obama
[28:58.720 --> 28:59.720]  now confirmed.
[28:59.720 --> 29:04.440]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and

[30:57.400 --> 30:58.400]  It's on sale at infowarsheam.com.
[30:58.400 --> 30:59.400]  The movie.info.

[31:01.400 --> 31:05.440]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save
[31:05.440 --> 31:10.920]  you a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the info war, a 360 win.
[31:10.920 --> 31:15.880]  Number one, when you choose auto-ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[31:15.880 --> 31:17.480]  at infowarsheam.com.
[31:17.480 --> 31:21.320]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[31:21.320 --> 31:25.400]  auto-ship because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[31:25.400 --> 31:30.680]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[31:30.680 --> 31:34.760]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[31:34.760 --> 31:36.520]  the products that you need each month.
[31:36.520 --> 31:41.160]  Just go to infowarsheam.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto-ship, and
[31:41.160 --> 31:44.280]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[31:44.280 --> 31:49.560]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto-ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[31:49.560 --> 31:50.960]  this is a sure win.
[31:50.960 --> 31:52.520]  10% off on auto-ship.
[31:52.520 --> 31:57.880]  Win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50, and all out of stock
[31:57.880 --> 32:00.960]  items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[32:00.960 --> 32:05.440]  We have the new product at infowarslife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[32:05.440 --> 32:10.240]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently we were able
[32:10.240 --> 32:16.200]  to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from Mustard Seed Extract.
[32:16.200 --> 32:21.040]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[32:21.040 --> 32:22.040]  body.
[32:22.040 --> 32:26.240]  It balances the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[32:26.240 --> 32:28.720]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[32:28.720 --> 32:32.680]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used
[32:32.680 --> 32:33.680]  all over the body.
[32:33.680 --> 32:39.760]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium,
[32:39.760 --> 32:45.080]  so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[32:45.080 --> 32:46.840]  I'm taking it now every day.
[32:46.840 --> 32:47.840]  This is soaking.
[32:47.840 --> 32:50.320]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[32:50.320 --> 32:53.520]  The best selenium that we could bring you, we believe is the best out there at a very,
[32:53.520 --> 32:54.520]  very low price.
[32:54.520 --> 33:23.800]  It's also available at M4WarsLive.com or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five-three-three-one-three-nine.
[33:23.800 --> 33:24.800]  You want answers?
[33:24.800 --> 33:25.800]  Well, so does he.
[33:25.800 --> 33:26.800]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[33:26.800 --> 33:27.800]  Broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:27.800 --> 33:28.800]  Project DRAGNET is admitted to have existed.
[33:28.800 --> 33:33.800]  Now, we've gotten part of the database from our law enforcement sources.
[33:33.800 --> 33:44.800]  It broke just 45 minutes ago at m4wars.com.
[33:44.800 --> 33:50.600]  NSA documents prove surveillance on Donald Trump and Alex Jones breaking now at m4wars.com.
[33:50.600 --> 33:54.000]  Get it out to everybody, and the investigative journalists and the law enforcement officer
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.960]  that helped get this out will be joining us in the next hour.
[33:56.960 --> 34:03.600]  But here is the former high-level CIA section chief of analysis who has been censored all
[34:03.600 --> 34:07.920]  over the news, former Fox News contributor Larry C. Johnson, with his current sources
[34:07.920 --> 34:10.720]  saying Trump was under surveillance during the campaign.
[34:10.720 --> 34:14.120]  But we have documents that Obama was surveilling Trump.
[34:14.120 --> 34:16.360]  We have the actual targeting documents.
[34:16.360 --> 34:18.760]  That's breaking now at m4wars.com.
[34:18.760 --> 34:19.760]  Here it is.
[34:19.760 --> 34:25.960]  In 2014, the CIA conducted an unauthorized search of Senate files, including the emails
[34:25.960 --> 34:30.640]  of Senate staff investigating the CIA's use of torture.
[34:30.640 --> 34:36.720]  The CIA inspector general later stated that the search involved improper agency access
[34:36.720 --> 34:42.520]  to Senate files, and a review board that you appointed concluded that the search resulted
[34:42.520 --> 34:46.200]  in inappropriate access to the committee's work product.
[34:46.200 --> 34:52.160]  Senior officials from the NSA, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
[34:52.160 --> 34:57.560]  have all testified that it would be inappropriate for their agencies to secretly search Senate
[34:57.560 --> 35:01.280]  files without external authorization.
[35:01.280 --> 35:09.720]  Would you agree that the CIA's 2014 search of Senate files was improper?
[35:09.720 --> 35:18.840]  The actions of the CIA were reasonable, given the very unclear and unwritten or unspecific
[35:18.840 --> 35:22.240]  understanding between the committee and the CIA at the time.
[35:22.240 --> 35:30.360]  The exact words of the review board were it resulted in inappropriate access to SSCI work
[35:30.360 --> 35:34.560]  product, and your inspector general reached the same conclusion.
[35:34.560 --> 35:40.520]  And so that undermines the very checks and balances that protect our democracy, and
[35:40.520 --> 35:46.480]  it's unacceptable in a free society, and your compatriots in all of the sister agencies
[35:46.480 --> 35:47.480]  agreed with that.
[35:47.480 --> 35:48.480]  Now, you disagree?
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.480]  Yes, I think you mischaracterized both their comments as well as what's in those reports.
[35:52.480 --> 35:55.640]  Do not say that we spied on Senate computers or your files.
[35:55.640 --> 35:56.640]  We did not do that.
[35:56.640 --> 35:58.680]  We were fulfilling our responsibilities.
[35:58.680 --> 36:06.000]  My concern here is that involving intelligence agencies in domestic politics takes us down
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.840]  a very, very dangerous road.
[36:08.840 --> 36:17.600]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[36:17.600 --> 36:19.440]  No, sir.
[36:19.440 --> 36:22.040]  It does not.
[36:22.040 --> 36:24.160]  Not wittingly.
[36:24.160 --> 36:31.280]  There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect, but not wittingly.
[36:31.280 --> 36:35.440]  But I would say that Mr. Snowden hasn't lied to anyone.
[36:35.440 --> 36:40.400]  He did break his oath of office, but part of his oath of office is to the Constitution,
[36:40.400 --> 36:45.360]  and he believes that when James Clapper came in March, our national director of intelligence
[36:45.360 --> 36:50.200]  came and lied that he was simply coming forward and telling the truth that your government
[36:50.200 --> 36:51.200]  was lying.
[36:51.200 --> 36:55.460]  And this is a big concern of mine, because it makes me doubt the administration and their
[36:55.460 --> 37:00.080]  word to us when they come and talk to us, because they have now admitted that they will
[37:00.080 --> 37:03.520]  lie to us if they think it's in the name of national security.
[37:03.520 --> 37:08.440]  Getting back to this New York Times writer, I want to play a short clip where he claims
[37:08.440 --> 37:12.120]  Trump got the idea from me that there was wiretapping.
[37:12.120 --> 37:14.000]  No, it was in the New York Times.
[37:14.000 --> 37:20.360]  I mean, I've never seen such attempts at just bazaar, the sun isn't in the sky at noon.
[37:20.360 --> 37:24.240]  I don't know as a CIA guy what you'd call this, but it's just like the worst gaslighting
[37:24.240 --> 37:25.240]  I've ever seen.
[37:25.240 --> 37:26.240]  Let's play this clip.
[37:26.240 --> 37:27.240]  That's heard.
[37:27.240 --> 37:32.200]  What do you make of the White House citing your article as part of the evidence?
[37:32.200 --> 37:37.520]  I mean, it's getting bizarre at this point, because we've said it very clearly and I said
[37:37.520 --> 37:40.280]  on your show that that's not what the story said.
[37:40.280 --> 37:43.600]  Anybody can read the story and see that's not what it said.
[37:43.600 --> 37:48.640]  And so this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he
[37:48.640 --> 37:53.680]  was wiretapped which developed on this kind of fringe right wing media.
[37:53.680 --> 37:54.680]  There it is, there it is.
[37:54.680 --> 37:55.680]  There it is, fringe wire.
[37:55.680 --> 37:57.220]  And then he wrote an article the day before.
[37:57.220 --> 38:00.920]  After his tweet storm, Info Wars then started saying, well, look, it was the New York Times
[38:00.920 --> 38:04.440]  who reported it, citing our story, misreading our story.
[38:04.440 --> 38:09.720]  And now a few weeks later, the White House and the president are citing Info Wars.
[38:09.720 --> 38:13.560]  So they've got one kind of bizarre right wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right
[38:13.560 --> 38:16.800]  wing fringe theory, both of which there's no evidence to support.
[38:16.800 --> 38:20.760]  I mean, just to be clear, there is, and correct me if I'm wrong, there's absolutely nothing
[38:20.760 --> 38:25.400]  whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times that indicates President Obama wiretapped
[38:25.400 --> 38:29.320]  or ordered the wiretapping of then candidate Trump, correct?
[38:29.320 --> 38:30.320]  Nothing.
[38:30.320 --> 38:33.480]  I mean, if we knew that, that is a fantastic story.
[38:33.480 --> 38:35.680]  That's a fantastic story.
[38:35.680 --> 38:37.000]  It was all over CNN everywhere.
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  We have the intercepts.
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.040]  We've caught General Flynn.
[38:39.040 --> 38:40.040]  He better resign.
[38:40.040 --> 38:41.040]  We have the transcript.
[38:41.040 --> 38:43.000]  Then they wouldn't release it because there was nothing there.
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.600]  He was lining up a phone call.
[38:44.600 --> 38:49.520]  We're showing you the articles of your radio listener, Intercept Russian Communications,
[38:49.520 --> 38:55.200]  part of Inquiry into Trump, Matthew Rosenberg, and phone calls from Trump Tower being intercepted.
[38:55.200 --> 38:59.320]  Man, that guy, what would you call Mr. Rosenberg politically?
[38:59.320 --> 39:02.480]  I mean, what is he doing there?
[39:02.480 --> 39:05.000]  A disinformation specialist.
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.480]  Look, he faults Donald Trump for being able to read.
[39:09.480 --> 39:14.320]  I mean, your listeners and those who are watching, if you simply, the headlines simply
[39:14.320 --> 39:20.200]  states wiretapped data used in Inquiry of Trump aides.
[39:20.200 --> 39:23.320]  It wasn't Donald Trump didn't write that headline.
[39:23.320 --> 39:25.960]  Alex Jones didn't write that headline.
[39:25.960 --> 39:26.960]  That was written by this guy.
[39:26.960 --> 39:33.200]  And then the guy who writes it has the audacity to claim, well, there's somebody else's
[39:33.200 --> 39:34.200]  fault.
[39:34.200 --> 39:40.760]  I mean, we are living in such a surreal, dangerous time.
[39:40.760 --> 39:45.360]  It's literally the world that, you know, we read about as children in Alice in Wonderland
[39:45.360 --> 39:48.280]  that was a fictional world.
[39:48.280 --> 39:55.160]  We're now seeing it in real time, where the objective facts are suddenly dismissed as
[39:55.160 --> 39:58.760]  being, you know, right-wing conspiracy theories.
[39:58.760 --> 40:04.920]  And it's just, you know, to me, it's alarming because it really threatens the foundation
[40:04.920 --> 40:06.360]  of our republic.
[40:06.360 --> 40:13.840]  Donald Trump is in essence correct that the intelligence agencies and some in the law enforcement
[40:13.840 --> 40:22.540]  community on the side of the FBI were in fact illegally trying to access, monitor his communications
[40:22.540 --> 40:25.480]  with his aides and with other people.
[40:25.480 --> 40:30.040]  All of this was an end to trying to destroy this credit, his presidency.
[40:30.040 --> 40:31.800]  I don't think there will be any doubt of that.
[40:31.800 --> 40:38.840]  I think it's worth noting that the head of the National Security Agency and Admiral Rogers
[40:38.840 --> 40:44.120]  made a journey to Trump Tower shortly after Trump had won.
[40:44.120 --> 40:49.520]  And in the immediate aftermath of his visit, the seat and Jim Clapper and others in the
[40:49.520 --> 40:53.560]  intelligence community called for him to be fired.
[40:53.560 --> 40:57.360]  Now, why did Rogers go to Trump Tower?
[40:57.360 --> 41:02.960]  My understanding is, let's call it, it was to cover himself because he was aware that
[41:02.960 --> 41:07.600]  the NSA had been misused and abused with respect.
[41:07.600 --> 41:13.000]  There's about four minutes of this boil down of the hour long interview we had on Friday
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.280]  with a gentleman who was a CIA section chief of intelligence and analysis.
[41:18.280 --> 41:23.040]  So he ran a whole region and then was the deputy head of counterterrorism in the State
[41:23.040 --> 41:27.880]  Department because that was a leading expert on terrorism in the State Department because
[41:27.880 --> 41:30.680]  it's always the main deputy that actually executes the operations.
[41:30.680 --> 41:36.320]  And he's a famous guy, just like all the other famous guys, the former head of technical
[41:36.320 --> 41:43.600]  at the NSA, the guy that actually ran it, William Benny, who's on Tuesday.
[41:43.600 --> 41:47.480]  He's had some medical issues and couldn't come on last week when all this info came
[41:47.480 --> 41:50.480]  out about the NSA and the rest of it is joining us tomorrow.
[41:50.480 --> 41:51.480]  Tough guy.
[41:51.480 --> 41:55.200]  He got hit with something and lost both his legs after he whistled blue and then they
[41:55.200 --> 41:58.320]  swat swat team and a bunch of other stuff.
[41:58.320 --> 42:03.120]  And that's why I'm not being dramatic here when I tell you, we're not playing games.
[42:03.120 --> 42:06.520]  They're going to come out and say this is fake like they always do.
[42:06.520 --> 42:09.560]  And they're going to come out and say, Lord knows what else.
[42:09.560 --> 42:13.640]  I know for a fact, they've got the highest levels, the Democratic Party.
[42:13.640 --> 42:20.160]  Well, I'm not going to say what they're doing at this point.
[42:20.160 --> 42:24.080]  I'm just telling you, there's been certain things I've done over the years that all hell
[42:24.080 --> 42:25.080]  breaks loose.
[42:25.080 --> 42:28.160]  This is one of them because the president knows there's a bunch of cowards out there
[42:28.160 --> 42:31.640]  that won't stand up for themselves, stand up for the country, stand up for him.
[42:31.640 --> 42:36.120]  But there are people that will and in fours is it.
[42:36.120 --> 42:39.120]  And so the president knows he was spot on.
[42:39.120 --> 42:40.120]  He's the president.
[42:40.120 --> 42:41.120]  Plus, it's all public.
[42:41.120 --> 42:42.120]  They spot him a Senate.
[42:42.120 --> 42:43.120]  You name it.
[42:43.120 --> 42:47.520]  Well, now the database with him being spot on before he was president is out when Obama
[42:47.520 --> 42:48.520]  was president.
[42:48.520 --> 42:50.280]  There you go.
[42:50.280 --> 42:52.800]  Powerful info on info wars dot com.

[43:11.040 --> 43:15.400]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science,

[43:16.960 --> 43:21.120]  The PPX is so small, you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful, you can run some

[44:07.120 --> 44:09.400]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.

[44:19.480 --> 44:22.760]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone

[46:22.600 --> 46:23.600]  Wow, thank you.
[46:23.600 --> 46:24.600]  Wow.

[46:26.000 --> 46:27.680]  Which pharmaceutical does you like best?
[46:27.680 --> 46:31.400]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest.
[46:31.400 --> 46:32.400]  That's amazing.
[46:32.400 --> 46:33.400]  That's really incredible.
[46:33.400 --> 46:35.800]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[46:35.800 --> 46:36.960]  I haven't felt it this week.
[46:36.960 --> 46:43.120]  My morning was fantastic, and I love the guys, I love the info wars crew, and I just want
[46:43.120 --> 46:47.800]  to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence,
[46:47.800 --> 46:48.800]  just buy it.
[46:48.800 --> 46:49.800]  We'll love it.
[46:49.800 --> 46:52.120]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[46:52.120 --> 46:56.520]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[46:56.520 --> 47:05.080]  It's a win-win infowarslife.com.
[47:05.080 --> 47:22.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:22.280 --> 47:28.040]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[47:28.040 --> 47:38.040]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[47:38.040 --> 47:39.040]  His name's Matt Rosenberg.
[47:39.040 --> 47:45.360]  He was in four articles, keep saying three, Zach Funander in the break, one of our great
[47:45.360 --> 47:51.000]  producers and researchers that know it's four articles, the week of the inauguration, the
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.760]  18th and 19th, the 21st, saying intercepts, wiretaps, communications, Trump Tower, NSA,
[47:57.760 --> 47:58.760]  spying on Trump.
[47:58.760 --> 48:04.360]  And then he goes on CNN Thursday and says, Alex Jones is crazy.
[48:04.360 --> 48:06.880]  He made up that I said wiretaps.
[48:06.880 --> 48:12.080]  They just choose me like they think I've been discredited and then say, Alex shut it and
[48:12.080 --> 48:13.080]  Trump picked it up.
[48:13.080 --> 48:18.800]  And then we show, and the piece Friday, I guess Zach found another one, three articles
[48:18.800 --> 48:24.440]  where Rosenberg says that they were wiretapping Trump, that Obama was.
[48:24.440 --> 48:26.600]  Now, I want to explain something.
[48:26.600 --> 48:31.440]  Now I'm going to show you mainstream news articles from Reuters, AP, New York Times,
[48:31.440 --> 48:33.040]  Lennon Guardian to prove this.
[48:33.040 --> 48:37.400]  I mean, I've covered this for decades, so it's old news.
[48:37.400 --> 48:42.240]  But they play this game like, oh, the whole universe starts over every five seconds.
[48:42.240 --> 48:43.840]  Like we're all goldfish and have no memory.
[48:43.840 --> 48:44.840]  Remember Gruber?
[48:44.840 --> 48:47.160]  The guy that helped write Obamacare said, thank God you have no attention fans.
[48:47.160 --> 48:48.680]  Thank God you're so dumb.
[48:48.680 --> 48:49.680]  He has such nerve.
[48:49.680 --> 48:53.680]  He comes out and attacks Trump for scams and the new healthcare bill when it's not perfect,
[48:53.680 --> 48:56.720]  but it's a lot better than Gruber.
[48:56.720 --> 48:58.840]  So Matthew Rosenberg thinks you're an idiot.
[48:58.840 --> 48:59.840]  Here it is.
[48:59.840 --> 49:07.800]  This is Mark Mazzetti, Carl Hulse, July 31, 2014, Inquiry by CIA affirms it's spied on
[49:07.800 --> 49:08.800]  Senate panels.
[49:08.800 --> 49:10.440]  So see, they spy illegally domestically.
[49:10.440 --> 49:12.440]  That was all admitted.
[49:12.440 --> 49:17.000]  A constitutional crisis, the CIA turns on the Senate, Lennon Guardian, exclusive US directs
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.640]  agents to cover up programs using investigative Americans, Reuters, using NSA database given
[49:21.640 --> 49:26.120]  to federal and state law enforcement with threat fusion centers.
[49:26.120 --> 49:34.400]  And then what comes out is the Electronic Frontier Foundation that is a pro-privacy
[49:34.400 --> 49:39.080]  rights, probably the preeminent group, even bigger than the ACLU, they actually do something,
[49:39.080 --> 49:40.640]  defending your rights in the digital world.
[49:40.640 --> 49:44.640]  And by that, they'll defend right wing, left wing, they don't care.
[49:44.640 --> 49:49.960]  Secret Master Revalence Network to spark global controversy this year, yet the National Security
[49:49.960 --> 49:53.560]  Agency Dragnet programs continually unconstitutionally monitoring Americans.
[49:53.560 --> 49:54.920]  So it goes on how it's continuing.
[49:54.920 --> 50:01.160]  Now the Dragnets admitted, Dragnets been in mainstream news, we've covered it.
[50:01.160 --> 50:05.520]  Law enforcement has access to the Dragnet database of who was surveilled.
[50:05.520 --> 50:08.520]  If they can go show an agency, they have pertinent reason.
[50:08.520 --> 50:15.360]  They can be selectively allowed in to the database of the National Security Agency.
[50:15.360 --> 50:21.320]  Not just the DEA, not just the FBI, not just the federal marshals, but local law enforcement,
[50:21.320 --> 50:25.920]  a large portion of it has been basically federally deputized.
[50:25.920 --> 50:29.120]  Which is of course, I've always said a dangerous thing, but then you kind of see how that's
[50:29.120 --> 50:30.360]  exposing it.
[50:30.360 --> 50:34.080]  But this comes from federal sources.
[50:34.080 --> 50:41.440]  In Sheriff Arpaio's cold posse case unit, it's broken so much, and Mike Zulo, who's
[50:41.440 --> 50:44.120]  an incredible patriot, and has all of his sources.
[50:44.120 --> 50:51.680]  But this is from the database, so the database has admitted.
[50:51.680 --> 50:54.120]  But no one's ever seen the database, but law enforcement.
[50:54.120 --> 50:57.640]  So they want to say the president's lying about all this.
[50:57.640 --> 51:03.040]  When it's already been in the news, in four New York Times articles, by one guy that goes
[51:03.040 --> 51:06.520]  on the news and says he never said it and we're crazy, and you all heard him a month
[51:06.520 --> 51:11.160]  and a half ago saying, we have the intercepts, they got the wiretaps, why we heard Trump
[51:11.160 --> 51:12.440]  and we heard all these people.
[51:12.440 --> 51:13.440]  That was all lies.
[51:13.440 --> 51:16.120]  There was no wiretapping, but there was nothing really there.
[51:16.120 --> 51:20.240]  As Nunes said two weeks ago, he finally came out yesterday and said, we've looked at it
[51:20.240 --> 51:21.240]  all.
[51:21.240 --> 51:24.640]  There's not even phone calls till he's president-elect of the Russians.
[51:24.640 --> 51:25.640]  There's nothing.
[51:25.640 --> 51:33.120]  Then they cry stuff like, well, one building he built in England had a Russian contractor.
[51:33.120 --> 51:37.560]  So they're desperate folks, but you remember, but you don't have to remember.
[51:37.560 --> 51:40.000]  We can show you the headlines.
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.120]  So Zach was just saying during the break.
[51:42.120 --> 51:44.720]  It's crazy how dumb they think we are.
[51:44.720 --> 51:49.240]  Remember, Obama administration, Russia preserve intelligence of Russian election hacking and
[51:49.240 --> 51:50.920]  their contacts with Trump.
[51:50.920 --> 51:53.440]  That was just 18 days ago.
[51:53.440 --> 51:58.920]  So you've got the whole deep state and the corrupt bureaucracy that's bipartisan that
[51:58.920 --> 52:01.840]  doesn't want Trump to be right, doesn't want him to reform the system.
[52:01.840 --> 52:06.680]  And it's funny that Trump was all Mr. Surveillance as long as it was against Al Qaeda or something.
[52:06.680 --> 52:08.720]  It's like, no, sir, they'll use it against everybody.
[52:08.720 --> 52:09.720]  Now he gets it.
[52:09.720 --> 52:11.720]  Isn't that incredible?
[52:11.720 --> 52:15.640]  Now he's learning.
[52:15.640 --> 52:23.760]  So the big news here is infowars.com has screenshots of it with the phone numbers cut off the back
[52:23.760 --> 52:29.840]  and the home address is cut off the back.
[52:29.840 --> 52:33.720]  You see, we even have a warehouse where we ship products out of and are administrative.
[52:33.720 --> 52:38.360]  And then we have a place where I actually do the show and they have the location of
[52:38.360 --> 52:42.960]  where I was actually doing the show until just a short time ago in the NSA database.
[52:42.960 --> 52:45.240]  And then this is like, this is the place to surveil.
[52:45.240 --> 52:47.040]  And these are the phone numbers to surveil.
[52:47.040 --> 52:49.520]  And this is where Alex Jones is really at.
[52:49.520 --> 52:51.760]  And this is where you actually target.
[52:51.760 --> 52:55.560]  This is where he's using phones is if I'm running around using, you know, the secretary's
[52:55.560 --> 52:57.520]  phone to make some illegal phone call.
[52:57.520 --> 53:02.640]  And I remember back when I first learned about this 10 years ago that the federal cases came
[53:02.640 --> 53:03.640]  up.
[53:03.640 --> 53:07.080]  So it ended up in newspapers that in intercepts of my phone calls and my emails, people that
[53:07.080 --> 53:10.920]  were being indicted and stuff on separate issues, they were using phone calls and stuff
[53:10.920 --> 53:14.960]  from my show to indict them or arrest them.
[53:14.960 --> 53:18.920]  Just like we learned with Roger Stones was under, actually got a FISA court on him.
[53:18.920 --> 53:23.480]  Hell, they were all over the news saying he's a Russian agent, surveil him, target Trump.
[53:23.480 --> 53:28.000]  We need the DOJ to investigate Trump as a Russian spy just three months ago in the campaign.
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  Remember that?
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.800]  And then they were, and they tell you they never were.
[53:32.800 --> 53:36.360]  It shows how dumb they are that they think you're that stupid.
[53:36.360 --> 53:38.240]  That's why Trump's approval ratings go up.
[53:38.240 --> 53:39.240]  There's go down.
[53:39.240 --> 53:43.520]  But after all these years of surveillance, they don't have anything that I ever did wrong
[53:43.520 --> 53:44.920]  because I'm pretty boring folks.
[53:44.920 --> 53:49.720]  I never get sick of barbecue and swimming in the swimming pool or going hog hunting like
[53:49.720 --> 53:51.520]  I did with my son and some folks yesterday.
[53:51.520 --> 53:56.320]  I just, I just never get sick of the same old stuff.
[53:56.320 --> 53:57.320]  I'm just a regular guy.
[53:57.320 --> 54:01.280]  I was the fact that I'm not going to be a slave of the new world order.
[54:01.280 --> 54:05.760]  So coming up, we've got Dr. Corsi on first who broke this through Sheriff Arpaio and
[54:05.760 --> 54:12.160]  the detectives, outgoing Sheriff, now I'm gone Sheriff, America up accounting.
[54:12.160 --> 54:19.520]  We got all this other incredible news, but I know I see these comments on them for worse.
[54:19.520 --> 54:25.880]  And I see the reports.
[54:25.880 --> 54:33.920]  And it's just, it's just mind blowing that they think you're so stupid that they can
[54:33.920 --> 54:36.200]  deny they've engaged in all this illegal surveillance.
[54:36.200 --> 54:37.800]  I have several clips I want to play.
[54:37.800 --> 54:40.360]  Before we do that, the crew's pointing the sound.
[54:40.360 --> 54:45.000]  Info wars got knocked off of Google ads through Ad Roll, their subsidiary company they work
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  with.
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.560]  And they said, because you criticize Obama and the Democrats in the UN and climate change,
[54:49.560 --> 54:50.560]  you're not real.
[54:50.560 --> 54:51.560]  We're banning you.
[54:51.560 --> 54:54.000]  They said, the president isn't real.
[54:54.000 --> 54:55.000]  We're trying to ban him.
[54:55.000 --> 54:56.480]  They said, he's not legitimate.
[54:56.480 --> 55:01.920]  And so they took that ad program strangely enough was just about all the extra money
[55:01.920 --> 55:07.280]  we had to budget for expansion in 2017 was $3.3 million.
[55:07.280 --> 55:08.280]  We've been doing it three years.
[55:08.280 --> 55:09.280]  It was very successful.
[55:09.280 --> 55:11.800]  It was to be $5 million or more this year.
[55:11.800 --> 55:15.280]  But that sounds like a lot of money when you've got 60 something employees and bandwidth and
[55:15.280 --> 55:18.080]  expenses and legal and I'm being tell you something.
[55:18.080 --> 55:19.080]  That's not a lot of money.
[55:19.080 --> 55:22.320]  We have a lot of other ways to fund ourselves, but that was just getting us there.
[55:22.320 --> 55:24.560]  It's funny what they blew away.
[55:24.560 --> 55:29.320]  All these leftist groups boycotting us and saying go after our sponsors.
[55:29.320 --> 55:31.840]  What they blew away was the extra money.
[55:31.840 --> 55:37.120]  So now we're in a position of not even having the money to go forward.
[55:37.120 --> 55:39.240]  And then they're hitting us with other stuff behind the scenes because they know we're
[55:39.240 --> 55:40.240]  hurting them.
[55:40.240 --> 55:41.240]  They know we're real.
[55:41.240 --> 55:42.240]  They know we'll tell the truth.
[55:42.240 --> 55:43.240]  They know we're fearless.
[55:43.240 --> 55:44.240]  They know we want justice.
[55:44.240 --> 55:45.240]  They know we're not stopping.
[55:45.240 --> 55:49.480]  They know we're Americans, bitter clingers who want unity and prosperity and freedom
[55:49.480 --> 55:50.480]  in this country.
[55:50.480 --> 55:51.920]  The globalists don't want that.
[55:51.920 --> 55:54.800]  Their own WikiLeaks show that they want total monopoly of power.
[55:54.800 --> 55:57.320]  That's called dictatorship.
[55:57.320 --> 55:58.760]  So we sell water filters.
[55:58.760 --> 56:02.520]  Because everybody needs, because of the toxins, the glyphosates, the garbage, the water.

[57:31.400 --> 57:33.400]  Incredible, says the other reviewers.
[57:33.400 --> 57:39.640]  Yeah, find out infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com and whatever you do, spread the article,
[57:39.640 --> 57:43.120]  spread the links, spread the videos because they're trying to block us on Google, not
[57:43.120 --> 57:46.960]  just with being able to sponsor but being able to share our links, Facebook, Twitter's
[57:46.960 --> 57:48.120]  ratcheting us down.
[57:48.120 --> 57:50.160]  They first strangle you before they shut you down.
[57:50.160 --> 57:51.160]  We're under attack.
[57:51.160 --> 57:55.800]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[57:55.800 --> 57:59.160]  before it became a loss to our modern diets, a processed junk.
[57:59.160 --> 58:04.360]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[58:04.360 --> 58:10.560]  bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single

[58:16.920 --> 58:20.920]  superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[58:20.920 --> 58:23.560]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[58:23.560 --> 58:28.640]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength
[58:28.640 --> 58:33.040]  from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces
[58:33.040 --> 58:34.160]  the blood for the body.
[58:34.160 --> 58:36.720]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[58:36.720 --> 58:41.080]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[58:41.080 --> 58:44.640]  to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[58:44.640 --> 58:49.120]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself in infowarslife.com

[59:54.600 --> 1:00:11.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:13.600]  We are on the march.
[1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:16.680]  The Empire is on the run.
[1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:20.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:20.600 --> 1:00:26.760]  All right, I want to play this clip before we go to the next segment and come in with
[1:00:26.760 --> 1:00:31.280]  the actual breakdown of the NSH spying on Donald Trump now confirmed by Barack Obama
[1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:33.680]  exclusively at infowars.com.
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:36.280]  Tim Allen on Trump's surveillance in Hollywood leftist.
[1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:37.640]  I don't like a lot of TV shows.
[1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:38.640]  I loved his show.
[1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:39.640]  Back when it was on.
[1:00:39.640 --> 1:00:40.640]  His other shows are hits.
[1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:43.840]  He's a hit top comic and he's just a common sense guy.
[1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:49.720]  He's not left or right and he went on to break all this down on Jimmy Kimmel's show.
[1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:52.920]  So let's analyze part of this piece right now.
[1:00:52.920 --> 1:00:54.520]  You went to the presidential inauguration.
[1:00:54.520 --> 1:00:59.800]  I was invited by, we did a VIP thing for the vets and went to the veterans ball and so
[1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:01.800]  I went to go see the Democrats or Republicans.
[1:01:01.800 --> 1:01:02.800]  Yeah, I went to the inauguration.
[1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:03.800]  I'm not attacking you.
[1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:04.800]  You get this down.
[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:05.800]  I'm not kidding.
[1:01:05.800 --> 1:01:06.800]  You've got to be real careful right here.
[1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:07.800]  You know, you get beat up.
[1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:08.800]  You know, everybody believes this is like 30s Germany.
[1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:09.800]  I don't know what happened.
[1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:10.800]  If you're not part of the group, you know what we believe is right.
[1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:22.600]  They go, well, I might have a problem with that.
[1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:23.600]  I'm a comedian.
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:26.600]  I like going on both sides.
[1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:28.760]  This government does stuff big.
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:30.360]  I've never been to anything like that.
[1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:31.360]  Was it a big deal?
[1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:32.360]  I mean, just so many people.
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:35.960]  And when they show up, you know, the ex-president gets in a helicopter and there's jets and
[1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:40.760]  Marines taking him this way and there's parades, but it looks like a Cadillac parade.
[1:01:40.760 --> 1:01:43.120]  Everything was just rows of Cadillacs.
[1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:45.200]  My kids are going, is this the parade?
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:47.880]  It's like black Cadillac after black Cadillac and then a tractor.
[1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:52.080]  I don't know what was, there's no like marching bands and stuff.
[1:01:52.080 --> 1:01:53.080]  I like parades.
[1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:54.840]  I used to like parades, which is a funny off story.
[1:01:54.840 --> 1:01:56.560]  I took my little one.
[1:01:56.560 --> 1:01:59.160]  I'm not ignorant, but sometimes I play it.
[1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:03.520]  We went to see the Santa Monica parade down in Santa Monica Boulevard.
[1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:04.520]  The gate parade.
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:08.440]  Oh, I thought when it went to gay, I thought, well, there'd be floats and stuff.
[1:02:08.440 --> 1:02:10.440]  You don't want to take a five year old to that parade.
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:11.440]  You don't want to.
[1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:12.440]  He's not bashing.
[1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:13.440]  Look at the music.
[1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:15.600]  It's like, why is it a bunch of naked men?
[1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:16.600]  What the hell?
[1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:17.600]  It's not.
[1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:18.600]  There's no bullwinkle.
[1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:19.600]  No, there's no.
[1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:21.600]  No, the parade does that again.
[1:02:21.600 --> 1:02:24.600]  Pride parades have a different tone.
[1:02:24.600 --> 1:02:25.600]  Yeah.
[1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:28.360]  The broad daylight of a bunch of naked men was the parade does that.
[1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:30.560]  I don't care if it's gay, but why do you do this?
[1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:32.360]  It's a lot of dominating everybody.
[1:02:32.360 --> 1:02:33.360]  It's hard to.
[1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:36.280]  So you're talking about, you know, well, you do stand up.
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:37.280]  You go around.
[1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:38.280]  You tell your piss.
[1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:39.280]  I've never seen this.
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:41.280]  You've never seen a parade from these really long time.
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:42.280]  What are you worried about?
[1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:43.280]  I'm worried about.
[1:02:43.280 --> 1:02:44.280]  I have the, I buddies that are in the security business.
[1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:45.280]  I'm a tech freak.
[1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:46.280]  So I have a guy this guy.
[1:02:46.280 --> 1:02:47.280]  No.
[1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:48.280]  This is so good.
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:49.280]  He says, what's Google doing?
[1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:50.280]  Like, so are these people?
[1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:51.840]  Come out because he tells me this weird story.
[1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:53.600]  You put an iPhone down for a week and shut it off.
[1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:54.580]  And a week it's dead, right?
[1:02:54.580 --> 1:02:56.920]  And they go, oh God, it's not really ever off.
[1:02:56.920 --> 1:02:58.120]  He goes, no, it's never off.
[1:02:58.120 --> 1:02:59.120]  They always know where you are.
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:00.640]  And they go, oh God.
[1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:03.000]  I get paranoid just from being around this cat.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  Oh.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  But one day I was thinking if a government drove by down the street with like a gray
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:09.260]  sedan with a camera on it.
[1:03:09.260 --> 1:03:11.220]  You'd be rioting going to Washington.
[1:03:11.220 --> 1:03:14.060]  But if it's white, with emojis and Google on it,
[1:03:14.060 --> 1:03:16.340]  yay, you're waving at it.
[1:03:16.340 --> 1:03:18.700]  They're taking pictures of your house.
[1:03:18.700 --> 1:03:23.700]  All right, you're waving at it.
[1:03:24.100 --> 1:03:26.900]  Take a picture of my house from the sky.
[1:03:28.260 --> 1:03:30.700]  There's that camera that looks around your block.
[1:03:30.700 --> 1:03:32.980]  Who are these people?
[1:03:32.980 --> 1:03:35.180]  I wanted to put FU on the top of my house.
[1:03:35.180 --> 1:03:39.620]  Have that satellite go, oh, no, no, no.
[1:03:39.620 --> 1:03:41.620]  Meggie, have you ever searched for your own house?
[1:03:41.620 --> 1:03:42.460]  Hell yeah.
[1:03:42.460 --> 1:03:43.300]  Yeah, right.
[1:03:43.300 --> 1:03:46.380]  And sometimes I'm out there going like this.
[1:03:46.380 --> 1:03:48.780]  I did it too and I was like, hey, there's my car.
[1:03:48.780 --> 1:03:51.140]  I know, it's a little spooky.
[1:03:51.140 --> 1:03:53.420]  That guy, our privacy, you give up.
[1:03:53.420 --> 1:03:56.740]  You go and I like Amazon Prime as much as anybody.
[1:03:56.740 --> 1:03:57.580]  You shop for a lot.
[1:03:57.580 --> 1:03:58.900]  I wish people would shop for the news
[1:03:58.900 --> 1:04:00.700]  as much as we shop for a new pair of glasses.
[1:04:00.700 --> 1:04:02.460]  I mean, you gotta look for stuff.
[1:04:02.460 --> 1:04:05.820]  But Amazon, at the bottom of, they suggest things
[1:04:05.820 --> 1:04:07.140]  you might like.
[1:04:07.140 --> 1:04:09.300]  You mean like the stuff I just bought yesterday?
[1:04:09.300 --> 1:04:10.140]  Yeah.
[1:04:10.140 --> 1:04:13.940]  Why did they go way too much about us?
[1:04:13.940 --> 1:04:16.540]  I feel sometimes they send things to my home
[1:04:16.540 --> 1:04:17.660]  that I never order.
[1:04:17.660 --> 1:04:18.980]  Just to see if you'd like it.
[1:04:18.980 --> 1:04:20.300]  And I always like it.
[1:04:20.300 --> 1:04:21.380]  It's a weird thing.
[1:04:21.380 --> 1:04:24.140]  It's like some automatic thing that's going on.
[1:04:24.140 --> 1:04:25.900]  This was a relational database,
[1:04:25.900 --> 1:04:27.580]  and I believe it was University of Wisconsin
[1:04:27.580 --> 1:04:28.660]  about 19 years ago.
[1:04:28.660 --> 1:04:29.900]  They started this whole thing.
[1:04:29.900 --> 1:04:33.020]  They'd give you 10 of your favorite movies,
[1:04:33.020 --> 1:04:34.940]  and you'd go, you know, I like these five.
[1:04:34.940 --> 1:04:36.060]  It would degree to you like them.
[1:04:36.060 --> 1:04:38.260]  They compared to another five, then you'd give it 20 more,
[1:04:38.260 --> 1:04:39.740]  and then 30, then you'd get down to 10.
[1:04:39.740 --> 1:04:42.260]  At the end of that, about 30 minutes of this,
[1:04:42.260 --> 1:04:43.700]  they'll give you five films that you'd love,
[1:04:43.700 --> 1:04:44.940]  and I loved every one of them.
[1:04:44.940 --> 1:04:45.780]  Really?
[1:04:45.780 --> 1:04:46.620]  They sold that to Harrods.
[1:04:46.620 --> 1:04:48.700]  That is now the relational database they use
[1:04:48.700 --> 1:04:49.540]  on all of us.
[1:04:49.540 --> 1:04:50.380]  On Netflix and what?
[1:04:50.380 --> 1:04:51.220]  Everywhere.
[1:04:51.220 --> 1:04:52.780]  Once they know your preferences.
[1:04:52.780 --> 1:04:53.620]  You know what's funny?
[1:04:53.620 --> 1:04:55.380]  Sometimes I get on my Netflix queue,
[1:04:55.380 --> 1:04:56.700]  and it says what I might like.
[1:04:56.700 --> 1:04:58.580]  I've never seen somebody dish so much knowledge
[1:04:58.580 --> 1:04:59.420]  in five minutes.
[1:04:59.420 --> 1:05:00.780]  That guy is so on target.
[1:05:01.660 --> 1:05:03.500]  Today we call it bone broth,
[1:05:03.500 --> 1:05:04.780]  and for thousands of years,
[1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:06.900]  our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[1:05:06.900 --> 1:05:08.980]  before it became a loss to our modern diets
[1:05:08.980 --> 1:05:10.140]  of processed junk.
[1:05:10.140 --> 1:05:13.300]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com,
[1:05:13.300 --> 1:05:16.380]  the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth,
[1:05:16.380 --> 1:05:18.500]  turmeric root, chaga mushroom,
[1:05:18.500 --> 1:05:20.740]  and seven total primal superfoods
[1:05:20.740 --> 1:05:23.860]  in a single, great tasting formula, Caveman.
[1:05:23.860 --> 1:05:25.500]  It's those people living in the wilds
[1:05:25.500 --> 1:05:27.260]  having to actually build civilization
[1:05:27.260 --> 1:05:29.020]  that are our superior ancestors,
[1:05:29.020 --> 1:05:31.300]  and we do everything we can to recapture them.
[1:05:31.300 --> 1:05:34.540]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[1:05:34.540 --> 1:05:35.940]  You used the meat for sustenance,
[1:05:35.940 --> 1:05:36.820]  the fat for cooking,
[1:05:36.820 --> 1:05:39.700]  but you used the bones for strength,
[1:05:39.700 --> 1:05:42.020]  from the outside structure full of minerals
[1:05:42.020 --> 1:05:43.620]  and key cofactors to the marrow
[1:05:43.620 --> 1:05:45.060]  that produces the blood for the body.
[1:05:45.060 --> 1:05:47.780]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[1:05:47.780 --> 1:05:50.700]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were,
[1:05:50.700 --> 1:05:53.220]  but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence
[1:05:53.220 --> 1:05:54.580]  that made us what we were,
[1:05:54.580 --> 1:05:55.780]  and this is a big part of it.
[1:05:55.780 --> 1:05:57.460]  I know you're gonna wanna check out Caveman,
[1:05:57.460 --> 1:05:59.260]  ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[1:05:59.260 --> 1:06:00.660]  and ForrestLive.com today.
[1:06:02.660 --> 1:06:05.660]  They took my saddle and hears through,
[1:06:05.660 --> 1:06:08.780]  broke my leg in the Santa Fe,
[1:06:10.620 --> 1:06:13.700]  lost my wife and a girlfriend
[1:06:13.700 --> 1:06:16.620]  somewhere along the way.
[1:06:16.620 --> 1:06:19.900]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[1:06:19.900 --> 1:06:23.940]  I'll be looking parade when they pull that game,
[1:06:23.940 --> 1:06:28.700]  and I hope that judge ain't blind.
[1:06:28.700 --> 1:06:31.900]  Amarillo by morning,
[1:06:31.900 --> 1:06:34.900]  amarillo's on my mind.
[1:06:40.460 --> 1:06:41.420]  We are back live.
[1:06:41.420 --> 1:06:43.020]  Thank you so much for joining us
[1:06:43.020 --> 1:06:45.220]  in this second hour of the Sunday broadcast.
[1:06:45.220 --> 1:06:47.020]  We're joined by investigative journalist,
[1:06:47.020 --> 1:06:48.380]  three times, number one,
[1:06:48.380 --> 1:06:52.140]  New York Times bestselling author, Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[1:06:52.140 --> 1:06:54.740]  Credited with winning one election for the Republicans
[1:06:54.740 --> 1:06:56.620]  and helping win three others.
[1:06:56.620 --> 1:06:58.460]  And of course, he formerly worked with the state department
[1:06:58.460 --> 1:07:00.340]  and other areas, and of course,
[1:07:00.340 --> 1:07:02.380]  as several degrees, one from Harvard
[1:07:02.380 --> 1:07:05.060]  with dealing with international banking and finance.
[1:07:05.060 --> 1:07:07.620]  He was an expert on so many fronts.
[1:07:07.620 --> 1:07:09.620]  He's published an article today
[1:07:09.620 --> 1:07:11.500]  that I wanted to wait till tomorrow to put out
[1:07:11.500 --> 1:07:14.940]  because I wanted to add some of the other breaking news to it.
[1:07:14.940 --> 1:07:17.140]  But Mirkel Thalen, as we speak,
[1:07:17.140 --> 1:07:20.940]  is adding some of the other backup documentation.
[1:07:20.940 --> 1:07:23.380]  I mean, this is proven, this is extremely credible,
[1:07:23.380 --> 1:07:27.620]  but everybody forgets they admit that the DEA,
[1:07:27.620 --> 1:07:29.860]  the FBI has accessed the NSA database
[1:07:29.860 --> 1:07:31.340]  and is spying on Americans domestically.
[1:07:31.340 --> 1:07:32.940]  They've had congressional hearings.
[1:07:32.940 --> 1:07:35.100]  It's been in hundreds of mainstream news articles.
[1:07:35.100 --> 1:07:37.220]  But I wanted to remind the public
[1:07:37.220 --> 1:07:39.900]  that there's parallel constructions going on
[1:07:39.900 --> 1:07:43.060]  where they use the NSA spy systems to look at Americans.
[1:07:43.060 --> 1:07:44.940]  Then they go and formulate investigations
[1:07:44.940 --> 1:07:48.020]  after they have the data from the NSA and go to the courts,
[1:07:48.020 --> 1:07:50.300]  claiming other evidence, many times fake,
[1:07:50.300 --> 1:07:52.500]  to be able to then get the indictments.
[1:07:52.500 --> 1:07:53.780]  So if you want to pull that up,
[1:07:53.780 --> 1:07:56.420]  just type in parallel construction
[1:07:56.420 --> 1:07:59.220]  and you'll get Reuters Associated Press,
[1:07:59.220 --> 1:08:01.060]  you name it, dealing with it.
[1:08:01.060 --> 1:08:02.340]  But here's some of the headlines.
[1:08:02.340 --> 1:08:07.220]  Dragnet NSA spying survived 2015 review.
[1:08:07.220 --> 1:08:09.780]  And that is a giant illegal domestic spy grid,
[1:08:09.780 --> 1:08:12.180]  electronic frontier foundation,
[1:08:12.180 --> 1:08:15.580]  going on for at least a decade plus,
[1:08:15.580 --> 1:08:17.220]  so several years of George W. Bush.
[1:08:17.220 --> 1:08:18.540]  There it is in Reuters.
[1:08:18.540 --> 1:08:20.820]  U.S. directs agents to cover up program use
[1:08:20.820 --> 1:08:22.940]  to investigate Americans illegally.
[1:08:22.940 --> 1:08:24.500]  That's Reuters.
[1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:26.420]  NSA files decoded, London Guarding
[1:08:26.420 --> 1:08:29.740]  and Edward Stone's surveillance revelations explain,
[1:08:29.740 --> 1:08:33.380]  confirmed by public documents and congressional inquiries.
[1:08:33.380 --> 1:08:37.020]  Again, the Senate spied on, just on budgetary.
[1:08:37.020 --> 1:08:38.580]  What are they planning to do with the CIA?
[1:08:38.580 --> 1:08:41.220]  The CIA spied on them, not as Chinese spies
[1:08:41.220 --> 1:08:42.620]  or anything else, but what are they gonna do
[1:08:42.620 --> 1:08:43.780]  with our budget?
[1:08:43.780 --> 1:08:45.060]  So illegally doing that.
[1:08:45.060 --> 1:08:47.740]  That's the New York Times.
[1:08:47.740 --> 1:08:50.940]  Here's another one, dealing with all of this.
[1:08:52.180 --> 1:08:54.500]  U.S. directs agents to cover up program.
[1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:55.980]  So it's all right there.
[1:08:57.060 --> 1:09:00.900]  Now, we know that Dragnet exist, did exist
[1:09:00.900 --> 1:09:02.460]  and electronic frontier foundation
[1:09:02.460 --> 1:09:05.220]  says at least up to 2016, it's still ongoing.
[1:09:05.220 --> 1:09:07.260]  That's a very respective nonpartisan group.
[1:09:09.460 --> 1:09:13.100]  But now, we have our law enforcement sources
[1:09:13.100 --> 1:09:15.100]  and we very careful about this because,
[1:09:16.020 --> 1:09:17.620]  I don't just do this as a matter of protecting
[1:09:17.620 --> 1:09:21.540]  myself, I have law enforcement sources and others.
[1:09:21.540 --> 1:09:22.820]  And then I have investigative journalists
[1:09:22.820 --> 1:09:24.540]  who have long histories of doing this for decades,
[1:09:24.540 --> 1:09:26.220]  like Corsi, you know, works for info
[1:09:26.220 --> 1:09:28.540]  or setting up a Washington bureau,
[1:09:28.540 --> 1:09:30.500]  who know how to do it legally and lawfully.
[1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:32.580]  Because let me tell you, I've talked to lawyers,
[1:09:32.580 --> 1:09:35.100]  I've talked to others when I got secret FBI manuals
[1:09:35.100 --> 1:09:37.540]  and other things, and I had family
[1:09:37.540 --> 1:09:38.780]  that'd been an intelligence agency,
[1:09:38.780 --> 1:09:41.020]  say you're lucky you're alive, man.
[1:09:41.020 --> 1:09:42.220]  You know, the stuff about veterans
[1:09:42.220 --> 1:09:43.060]  are the number one enemy,
[1:09:43.060 --> 1:09:44.980]  there's an actual gun confiscation plan.
[1:09:44.980 --> 1:09:46.620]  All that stuff nobody believed for a week
[1:09:46.620 --> 1:09:48.420]  when we broke it, the Mayak report,
[1:09:48.420 --> 1:09:49.860]  remember the veterans of the terrorists,
[1:09:49.860 --> 1:09:53.180]  and then Napolitano, Janet Napolitano,
[1:09:53.180 --> 1:09:55.580]  the bad Napolitano, not Judge Napolitano,
[1:09:55.580 --> 1:09:59.300]  came out and said, oh yes,
[1:09:59.300 --> 1:10:00.980]  we are saying the veterans are number one enemy,
[1:10:00.980 --> 1:10:02.140]  that's a real manual.
[1:10:02.140 --> 1:10:03.740]  Well, this is bigger than that, okay?
[1:10:03.740 --> 1:10:05.500]  It's up on infowars.com,
[1:10:06.940 --> 1:10:09.380]  NSA database documents,
[1:10:09.380 --> 1:10:12.780]  NSA electronic surveillance of Donald Trump
[1:10:12.780 --> 1:10:15.780]  in Trump Tower in Alex Jones in Texas.
[1:10:15.780 --> 1:10:17.740]  And it goes through it and has screenshots
[1:10:17.740 --> 1:10:22.580]  of the real documents, but the phone numbers are exed out,
[1:10:22.580 --> 1:10:23.660]  and that's done in the database
[1:10:23.660 --> 1:10:25.740]  until you get authorization to get into,
[1:10:25.740 --> 1:10:28.140]  you have to have secret clearance to get into it.
[1:10:28.140 --> 1:10:30.580]  But when state police and federal law enforcement want it,
[1:10:30.580 --> 1:10:33.420]  they've got to get authorization from special boards
[1:10:33.420 --> 1:10:34.580]  that are very shadowy to get into it,
[1:10:34.580 --> 1:10:35.500]  then it unlocks it all.
[1:10:35.500 --> 1:10:37.500]  But I know these phone numbers, I've called Trump,
[1:10:37.500 --> 1:10:39.980]  he's called me on these numbers, it's all right here.
[1:10:39.980 --> 1:10:40.900]  Of course, Trump's the president,
[1:10:40.900 --> 1:10:42.140]  he knows way more than this
[1:10:42.140 --> 1:10:43.780]  when he says he knows he's been surveilled.
[1:10:43.780 --> 1:10:45.660]  Well, it turns out he's been surveilled by Obama
[1:10:45.660 --> 1:10:46.940]  than even before.
[1:10:46.940 --> 1:10:48.340]  So this is huge.
[1:10:48.340 --> 1:10:51.020]  It's on infowars.com right now.
[1:10:51.020 --> 1:10:51.900]  We're updating the article
[1:10:51.900 --> 1:10:54.100]  and adding new documentation as it goes.
[1:10:54.100 --> 1:10:56.340]  So if you've already been looking at it, hit refresh.
[1:10:56.340 --> 1:10:57.380]  Let's go to Dr. Corsi,
[1:10:57.380 --> 1:10:59.300]  we've got five minutes till break, we'll come back.
[1:10:59.300 --> 1:11:01.660]  Let me have the detective with the cold case posse
[1:11:01.660 --> 1:11:04.220]  with the outgoing sheriff in Maricopa County.
[1:11:04.220 --> 1:11:08.260]  Sheriff Opio has been bravely involved in all this as well.
[1:11:08.260 --> 1:11:11.700]  So give us a boil down of how big this is, Dr. Corsi.
[1:11:11.700 --> 1:11:15.860]  Well, this is a tremendous find.
[1:11:15.860 --> 1:11:20.860]  Mike Zulu and Sheriff Opio had project database records.
[1:11:21.100 --> 1:11:22.940]  They got from a whistleblower.
[1:11:22.940 --> 1:11:24.020]  They've been proving them out,
[1:11:24.020 --> 1:11:26.500]  they've had them since 2013.
[1:11:26.500 --> 1:11:29.740]  Now, it was really over the past week
[1:11:29.740 --> 1:11:31.460]  when I started talking with Mike Zulu.
[1:11:31.460 --> 1:11:35.220]  We found, we realized that Donald Trump was in this database.
[1:11:35.220 --> 1:11:38.100]  He searched it for it and we're posting it
[1:11:38.100 --> 1:11:40.340]  on infowars right now.
[1:11:40.340 --> 1:11:43.740]  Donald Trump has been wiretaps, electronic surveillance,
[1:11:44.820 --> 1:11:47.940]  all over the place, certainly Trump Tower,
[1:11:47.940 --> 1:11:52.940]  but also Mar-a-Lago, various companies that he's owned,
[1:11:53.060 --> 1:11:57.460]  golf courses, since 2004,
[1:11:57.460 --> 1:12:01.460]  continuing into 2009 when Obama came into office,
[1:12:01.460 --> 1:12:03.620]  and we have no reason to believe it quit.
[1:12:03.620 --> 1:12:05.660]  Now, you can't read them,
[1:12:05.660 --> 1:12:09.160]  but they come out as these huge pages
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:11.260]  of logs and logs and logs
[1:12:11.260 --> 1:12:14.300]  that show the names and the businesses,
[1:12:14.300 --> 1:12:16.740]  the addresses, the phone numbers that were harvested.
[1:12:16.740 --> 1:12:18.060]  And to protect the innocent,
[1:12:18.060 --> 1:12:20.500]  we're only releasing very limited amounts.
[1:12:20.500 --> 1:12:22.500]  Right, we're really gonna try to be very careful
[1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:24.540]  in what we're gonna release on this
[1:12:24.540 --> 1:12:28.100]  because we're not printing the actual documents,
[1:12:28.100 --> 1:12:30.620]  but there's probably a million records,
[1:12:30.620 --> 1:12:33.460]  a million peoples under electronic surveillance
[1:12:33.460 --> 1:12:35.700]  in this one database that was handed over
[1:12:35.700 --> 1:12:39.180]  to law enforcement and Sheriff R. Pyle's office.
[1:12:39.180 --> 1:12:44.180]  And what it shows is that everybody associated with Trump,
[1:12:44.340 --> 1:12:47.500]  in other words, once the NSA picked up Trump,
[1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:50.780]  anyone Trump called was then picked up as well.
[1:12:50.780 --> 1:12:53.980]  So you've got a whole list of his employees here,
[1:12:53.980 --> 1:12:55.780]  and we're listing the employees.
[1:12:55.780 --> 1:12:58.860]  I think we'll wanna make sure we don't include
[1:12:58.860 --> 1:13:01.540]  the phone numbers, that was in some of the original records,
[1:13:01.540 --> 1:13:03.340]  but I've redacted everything.
[1:13:03.340 --> 1:13:05.140]  Phone numbers aren't there, so you could,
[1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:07.260]  but call them.
[1:13:07.260 --> 1:13:10.660]  But project managers, the Trump organization,
[1:13:10.660 --> 1:13:12.820]  people running as golf courses.
[1:13:12.820 --> 1:13:14.220]  And by the way, you called me last week
[1:13:14.220 --> 1:13:16.500]  with the sources and said, yeah, is this your cell?
[1:13:16.500 --> 1:13:17.660]  Yeah, that's my old cell.
[1:13:17.660 --> 1:13:20.420]  Yeah, this is your private office.
[1:13:20.420 --> 1:13:22.500]  People always come to the warehouse and then, yeah,
[1:13:22.500 --> 1:13:24.580]  there it is, I've moved out of their office too.
[1:13:24.580 --> 1:13:28.820]  This is wild, so again, let's talk about the sourcing of this.
[1:13:28.820 --> 1:13:30.780]  This is big, I mean, this is huge.
[1:13:30.780 --> 1:13:32.940]  This is proving that, oh yeah,
[1:13:32.940 --> 1:13:35.140]  and this is just the database we had a hold of,
[1:13:35.140 --> 1:13:37.060]  that Obama, when he was in office,
[1:13:37.060 --> 1:13:39.300]  was involved in surveillance of President Trump
[1:13:39.300 --> 1:13:41.020]  before he was president.
[1:13:41.020 --> 1:13:43.180]  Yes, and also through the time he was president,
[1:13:43.180 --> 1:13:45.580]  Obama was continuing the wear-tapping
[1:13:45.580 --> 1:13:47.620]  of this operation, Dragnet,
[1:13:47.620 --> 1:13:48.740]  and I think he continued it
[1:13:48.740 --> 1:13:50.500]  through his entire administration.
[1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:53.540]  The point of all this is that, you know,
[1:13:53.540 --> 1:13:56.140]  this is again documentation that Trump
[1:13:56.140 --> 1:13:58.740]  was under electronic surveillance
[1:13:58.740 --> 1:14:01.500]  in a much more massive way than I think
[1:14:01.500 --> 1:14:03.460]  Trump even realizes.
[1:14:03.460 --> 1:14:06.060]  I mean, all of his, Trump palace was,
[1:14:06.060 --> 1:14:08.860]  they were actually, these records show
[1:14:08.860 --> 1:14:12.220]  that Ivana Trump was under surveillance.
[1:14:13.140 --> 1:14:15.980]  They have Fred Trump, which seems to be the father
[1:14:15.980 --> 1:14:17.260]  under surveillance.
[1:14:17.260 --> 1:14:19.660]  They have employees of Trump.
[1:14:19.660 --> 1:14:23.380]  So that's a massive Dragnet of pulling in,
[1:14:23.380 --> 1:14:26.340]  and it was not only the phone messages,
[1:14:26.340 --> 1:14:28.700]  but then they did electronic surveillance
[1:14:28.700 --> 1:14:30.540]  of all the financial records.
[1:14:30.540 --> 1:14:32.580]  They went and got bank records,
[1:14:32.580 --> 1:14:34.940]  they had credit card transaction records,
[1:14:34.940 --> 1:14:37.420]  our tax records, and it was all compiled
[1:14:37.420 --> 1:14:41.580]  into massive databases on Trump going back to 2004,
[1:14:41.580 --> 1:14:43.500]  and I think continuing until today.
[1:14:44.820 --> 1:14:46.460]  By the way, it's incontrovertible.
[1:14:46.460 --> 1:14:47.780]  That's what I'm having added to the article
[1:14:47.780 --> 1:14:50.860]  that the New York Times said in four different articles
[1:14:50.860 --> 1:14:53.140]  in January that they were surveilling Trump,
[1:14:53.140 --> 1:14:56.340]  that they had the wiretaps, the NSA intercepts,
[1:14:56.340 --> 1:14:57.620]  and so we have all these other admissions
[1:14:57.620 --> 1:14:59.460]  of the Senate being spot on, you name it.
[1:14:59.460 --> 1:15:01.460]  So the claim that Trump's discredited
[1:15:01.460 --> 1:15:02.380]  and that none of this happened
[1:15:02.380 --> 1:15:04.220]  and that agencies say it didn't happen,
[1:15:04.220 --> 1:15:06.380]  well, I mean, we famously have clapper
[1:15:06.380 --> 1:15:09.140]  in front of the Congressional Committee
[1:15:09.140 --> 1:15:11.540]  saying that the NSA spies on no one in the US
[1:15:11.540 --> 1:15:13.940]  when it's completely admitted they are.
[1:15:13.940 --> 1:15:16.860]  I mean, as I say, we're not gonna release the list,
[1:15:16.860 --> 1:15:20.700]  but there's a million names on these lists,
[1:15:20.700 --> 1:15:24.500]  and what these lists show is the name of the person,
[1:15:24.500 --> 1:15:27.380]  the file number, the business, the address.
[1:15:27.380 --> 1:15:28.220]  And the file's key.
[1:15:28.220 --> 1:15:29.780]  This is a database of who you wanna go in
[1:15:29.780 --> 1:15:31.020]  and then hear the files.
[1:15:31.020 --> 1:15:33.620]  So this is a database to index, like a library, go in
[1:15:33.620 --> 1:15:34.820]  and then you wanna hear them,
[1:15:34.820 --> 1:15:36.660]  track their whole history, there it is.
[1:15:36.660 --> 1:15:39.460]  And the phone numbers, now all the phone numbers,
[1:15:39.460 --> 1:15:42.300]  and law enforcement, Mike Zula and Sheriff Harpal's
[1:15:42.300 --> 1:15:44.220]  been checking this out for a long time,
[1:15:44.220 --> 1:15:46.180]  the phone numbers all check.
[1:15:46.180 --> 1:15:49.060]  You saw your own record in this database, Alex,
[1:15:49.060 --> 1:15:52.020]  and proved out that that was all authentic information.
[1:15:52.020 --> 1:15:54.740]  Oh, it's got a phone number nobody even knew
[1:15:54.740 --> 1:15:57.420]  and it's got an address I used to secretly broadcast out of.
[1:15:57.420 --> 1:15:59.620]  We'll be back though, let me come right back to you.
[1:16:01.620 --> 1:16:03.620]  The reason InfoWars Live has five star ratings
[1:16:03.620 --> 1:16:05.980]  on major third party sites is because I want products
[1:16:05.980 --> 1:16:07.020]  I'm gonna use for my family.
[1:16:07.020 --> 1:16:09.060]  I take this, my family takes this,
[1:16:09.060 --> 1:16:10.540]  and then it funds the operation
[1:16:10.540 --> 1:16:12.500]  with the most hardcore, truthful information
[1:16:12.500 --> 1:16:13.340]  you're gonna find anywhere.
[1:16:13.340 --> 1:16:16.140]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find
[1:16:16.140 --> 1:16:17.900]  in our products at infowarslife.com.
[1:16:17.900 --> 1:16:19.820]  If I ever forget to take them,
[1:16:19.820 --> 1:16:22.540]  like I'm having noticeable difference.
[1:16:22.540 --> 1:16:23.700]  I don't feel good.
[1:16:23.700 --> 1:16:25.580]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones
[1:16:25.580 --> 1:16:27.460]  that was life changing for me.
[1:16:27.460 --> 1:16:30.140]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my superfemale.
[1:16:30.140 --> 1:16:32.420]  I had a few bottles at my house
[1:16:32.420 --> 1:16:34.060]  and I've been taking it again,
[1:16:34.060 --> 1:16:35.900]  hitting the gym once again.
[1:16:35.900 --> 1:16:38.900]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[1:16:38.900 --> 1:16:42.420]  And I know my hair's luxurious once again.
[1:16:42.420 --> 1:16:45.140]  So obviously the superfemale is amazing, I love it.
[1:16:45.140 --> 1:16:47.940]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[1:16:47.940 --> 1:16:49.020]  Survival Shield X2.
[1:16:49.020 --> 1:16:51.340]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing,
[1:16:51.340 --> 1:16:53.700]  that I would suggest it's nascent iodine,
[1:16:53.700 --> 1:16:55.140]  Survival Shield X2.
[1:16:55.140 --> 1:16:56.780]  It's got a five star rating.
[1:16:56.780 --> 1:16:59.300]  It's a win-win infowarslife.com.
[1:17:00.860 --> 1:17:03.100]  I am very proud to announce the introduction
[1:17:03.100 --> 1:17:08.100]  of the highest quality infowars biome defense probiotic.
[1:17:08.340 --> 1:17:11.380]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum

[1:18:01.340 --> 1:18:03.260]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[1:18:03.260 --> 1:18:05.260]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[1:18:05.260 --> 1:18:08.180]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:18:08.180 --> 1:18:11.060]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals
[1:18:11.060 --> 1:18:14.260]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[1:18:14.260 --> 1:18:16.620]  The same team based right here in America
[1:18:16.620 --> 1:18:18.580]  that brought you the Alexa Pure
[1:18:18.580 --> 1:18:20.740]  groundbreaking water filtration systems
[1:18:20.740 --> 1:18:23.460]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[1:18:23.460 --> 1:18:24.820]  Whether it's your home or office,
[1:18:24.820 --> 1:18:26.980]  you owe it to yourself, your coworkers,
[1:18:26.980 --> 1:18:28.540]  your family, your children
[1:18:28.540 --> 1:18:30.980]  to the best job you can to purify your air.
[1:18:30.980 --> 1:18:33.700]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment
[1:18:33.700 --> 1:18:36.140]  while themselves doing things that mitigate
[1:18:36.140 --> 1:18:39.060]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[1:18:39.060 --> 1:18:41.220]  The general public doesn't.
[1:18:41.220 --> 1:18:45.060]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:18:45.060 --> 1:18:47.740]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet
[1:18:47.740 --> 1:18:48.700]  incredibly clean.
[1:18:48.700 --> 1:18:50.460]  This is a system I'm personally putting in
[1:18:50.460 --> 1:18:52.300]  throughout my house replacing older
[1:18:52.300 --> 1:18:55.380]  or expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:18:55.380 --> 1:18:58.380]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today
[1:18:58.380 --> 1:18:59.780]  and then FullWarStore.com.
[1:19:02.180 --> 1:19:03.740]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:19:03.740 --> 1:19:06.420]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money
[1:19:06.420 --> 1:19:09.700]  on one of the best new off the grid products of 2017.
[1:19:09.700 --> 1:19:11.260]  And seriously, I really think everyone
[1:19:11.260 --> 1:19:12.220]  should have one of these.
[1:19:12.220 --> 1:19:14.660]  I'm talking about the PPX Solar Generator System
[1:19:14.660 --> 1:19:16.460]  from our friends at Solutions from Science,
[1:19:16.460 --> 1:19:18.060]  one of our oldest sponsors.
[1:19:18.060 --> 1:19:20.540]  The PPX is so small, you can put it in your pocket,
[1:19:20.540 --> 1:19:23.300]  but so powerful, you can run some 110 appliances
[1:19:23.300 --> 1:19:25.380]  at your house, like a small refrigerator,
[1:19:25.380 --> 1:19:27.140]  so you can keep food from spoiling.
[1:19:27.140 --> 1:19:29.780]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks,
[1:19:29.780 --> 1:19:32.700]  buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.

[1:20:04.940 --> 1:20:07.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:12.260 --> 1:20:14.740]  In this present crisis,
[1:20:14.740 --> 1:20:18.340]  government is not the solution to our problem.
[1:20:18.340 --> 1:20:20.140]  Government is the problem.
[1:20:22.900 --> 1:20:25.140]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe
[1:20:25.140 --> 1:20:27.940]  that society has become too complex
[1:20:27.940 --> 1:20:30.620]  to be managed by self-rule,
[1:20:30.620 --> 1:20:33.540]  that government by an elite group is superior
[1:20:33.540 --> 1:20:38.540]  to government for, by, and of the people.
[1:20:38.660 --> 1:20:40.780]  The Alex Jones Show,
[1:20:40.780 --> 1:20:43.860]  because there is a war on for your mind.
[1:20:43.860 --> 1:20:48.540]  Hello, me, meet the real me, and my meet the real me.
[1:20:48.540 --> 1:20:51.220]  All right, due to some of those things going on
[1:20:51.220 --> 1:20:52.860]  with security issues, this is a big deal.
[1:20:52.860 --> 1:20:54.460]  We've started publishing this today.
[1:20:54.460 --> 1:20:57.220]  There's more reports coming out in the next week.
[1:20:57.220 --> 1:20:59.780]  I've been talking to Dr. Corsi about what he thinks is best.
[1:20:59.780 --> 1:21:04.020]  We have done boil downs of what's in these documents
[1:21:04.020 --> 1:21:05.020]  and posted them.
[1:21:05.020 --> 1:21:08.020]  I think we should black out with just a marker,
[1:21:08.020 --> 1:21:10.900]  the contact info for people, and go ahead
[1:21:10.900 --> 1:21:11.740]  so everybody can see.
[1:21:11.740 --> 1:21:13.700]  And I think you can just use a computer program.
[1:21:13.700 --> 1:21:14.780]  Obviously, or my crew can do it.
[1:21:14.780 --> 1:21:16.900]  Dr. Corsi, now that you're part of InfoWords,
[1:21:16.900 --> 1:21:18.980]  if you want us to just black out in the whole column,
[1:21:18.980 --> 1:21:20.380]  the phone numbers,
[1:21:20.380 --> 1:21:22.180]  I think we should do like what he leaks does.
[1:21:22.180 --> 1:21:23.900]  They release it all.
[1:21:23.900 --> 1:21:26.180]  I think we should release with the contact info
[1:21:26.180 --> 1:21:27.700]  redacted, everybody's name.
[1:21:27.700 --> 1:21:29.180]  So folks know they were being spied on
[1:21:29.180 --> 1:21:31.500]  because again, this comes from law enforcement sources.
[1:21:31.500 --> 1:21:33.860]  Now we know the DEA, state police,
[1:21:33.860 --> 1:21:36.220]  these threat fusion centers have access to this dragnet.
[1:21:36.220 --> 1:21:38.460]  We know that this is going on.
[1:21:38.460 --> 1:21:39.740]  It's been in the news.
[1:21:39.740 --> 1:21:42.980]  And we know that Cheryl Atkinson of CBS on Fast and Furious
[1:21:42.980 --> 1:21:44.060]  has surveilled by Obama.
[1:21:44.060 --> 1:21:45.500]  She confirmed that.
[1:21:45.500 --> 1:21:46.900]  So the claim this isn't going on
[1:21:46.900 --> 1:21:49.540]  is like saying the sun didn't come up this morning,
[1:21:49.540 --> 1:21:52.100]  but they'll either ignore this giant bombshell story
[1:21:52.100 --> 1:21:54.220]  or say it's made up.
[1:21:54.220 --> 1:21:57.100]  So we've got the detective coming on to talk about this
[1:21:57.100 --> 1:21:57.940]  in the next segment.
[1:21:57.940 --> 1:21:59.100]  You'll write shotgun with us.
[1:21:59.100 --> 1:22:04.100]  But I mean, I always err on the side of safety
[1:22:04.980 --> 1:22:08.660]  and privacy, but at the same time,
[1:22:08.660 --> 1:22:13.140]  maybe if the media challenges this and says it isn't real,
[1:22:13.140 --> 1:22:15.180]  then you can't trust MSM though.
[1:22:15.180 --> 1:22:17.260]  You send them the database, they'll put it out.
[1:22:17.260 --> 1:22:18.420]  You know, we've run into this before.
[1:22:18.420 --> 1:22:19.780]  I don't know what to do.
[1:22:19.780 --> 1:22:21.540]  Because obviously they're going to say this isn't real.
[1:22:21.540 --> 1:22:24.620]  Just like, you know, when we said Obamacare had death panels
[1:22:24.620 --> 1:22:26.940]  or got rid of your doctor or doubled prices
[1:22:26.940 --> 1:22:29.100]  and groupers said, thank God they're dumb, you know,
[1:22:29.100 --> 1:22:29.940]  we just denied it.
[1:22:29.940 --> 1:22:31.780]  I mean, we know this is real.
[1:22:31.780 --> 1:22:32.860]  We know this is happening.
[1:22:32.860 --> 1:22:34.380]  I mean, this is a big deal though.
[1:22:34.380 --> 1:22:36.340]  This is one of the biggest stories in the last year
[1:22:36.340 --> 1:22:38.820]  that they've made this big deal saying Trump's wrong.
[1:22:38.820 --> 1:22:40.820]  Nobody surveilled him when they're in the news.
[1:22:40.820 --> 1:22:43.020]  Months ago saying they were surveilling him,
[1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:44.300]  but there's nothing in the surveillance.
[1:22:44.300 --> 1:22:45.740]  So now they've backed off of it.
[1:22:45.740 --> 1:22:48.460]  The intelligence house head, Nunes says,
[1:22:48.460 --> 1:22:49.500]  there's nothing there.
[1:22:49.500 --> 1:22:51.820]  He was surveilled, but there's nothing there.
[1:22:51.820 --> 1:22:54.500]  It's just crazy that they would try to deny
[1:22:54.500 --> 1:22:57.980]  in this age of snow that surveillance is going on.
[1:22:57.980 --> 1:23:00.620]  And then he's the president, he knows he was.
[1:23:00.620 --> 1:23:02.340]  If we're getting these documentation,
[1:23:02.340 --> 1:23:03.340]  imagine what he's getting.
[1:23:03.340 --> 1:23:05.580]  I guess that's why he's so confident
[1:23:05.580 --> 1:23:09.100]  because he said in the next week or so a few days ago,
[1:23:09.100 --> 1:23:09.940]  this would come out.
[1:23:09.940 --> 1:23:14.220]  I guess, I wonder how it's coming out here, Dr. Carson.
[1:23:14.220 --> 1:23:16.020]  Alex, that's exactly how it's coming out.
[1:23:16.020 --> 1:23:19.460]  On Tuesday last week, when I had the information,
[1:23:19.460 --> 1:23:22.300]  I shared it with the White House.
[1:23:22.300 --> 1:23:24.620]  President Trump has known about this database
[1:23:24.620 --> 1:23:27.860]  and that we were going to break this story since Tuesday.
[1:23:27.860 --> 1:23:29.340]  Also-
[1:23:29.340 --> 1:23:30.180]  By the way, let me stop you.
[1:23:30.180 --> 1:23:32.100]  I didn't know if you were ready to release that now.
[1:23:32.100 --> 1:23:33.780]  Of course I knew that.
[1:23:33.780 --> 1:23:35.860]  So, and I don't want to say who you're in contact with
[1:23:35.860 --> 1:23:36.980]  because they'll try to purge him,
[1:23:36.980 --> 1:23:39.860]  but I mean, we're in contact with a lot of folks at the top.
[1:23:39.860 --> 1:23:42.860]  Take your time here, Dr. Carson, even in the next segment.
[1:23:42.860 --> 1:23:46.660]  Let's walk through here the fact that they'll say,
[1:23:46.660 --> 1:23:47.820]  oh, they got it from InfoWars.
[1:23:47.820 --> 1:23:51.060]  No, we got it from law enforcement, just like WikiLeaks.
[1:23:51.060 --> 1:23:53.220]  WikiLeaks has this too now.
[1:23:53.220 --> 1:23:55.420]  So just explain what's happening.
[1:23:55.420 --> 1:23:57.380]  Well, we got it from law enforcement.
[1:23:57.380 --> 1:24:00.540]  That's the project, dragnet, database,
[1:24:00.540 --> 1:24:03.740]  the listing of names, phone numbers, telephone numbers,
[1:24:03.740 --> 1:24:08.660]  electronic surveillance since 2004 through 2010.
[1:24:08.660 --> 1:24:12.060]  I made sure the White House had the raw data
[1:24:12.060 --> 1:24:14.580]  on Donald Trump last Tuesday.
[1:24:14.580 --> 1:24:17.740]  We also shared it with some key members of Congress,
[1:24:17.740 --> 1:24:20.060]  one or two select members of Congress,
[1:24:20.060 --> 1:24:23.620]  and we're wanting to go and present this
[1:24:23.620 --> 1:24:25.300]  to the Department of Justice.
[1:24:25.300 --> 1:24:27.260]  Now, we're going to have one more story.
[1:24:27.260 --> 1:24:29.140]  I'll be writing it up tomorrow,
[1:24:29.140 --> 1:24:33.900]  and we can prove the extent to which Sheriff Arpaio
[1:24:33.900 --> 1:24:37.540]  was wiretapped, electronic surveillance,
[1:24:37.540 --> 1:24:39.740]  interference with his court case,
[1:24:39.740 --> 1:24:43.020]  and we're going to start to share that information as well
[1:24:43.020 --> 1:24:44.460]  with the White House.
[1:24:44.460 --> 1:24:45.860]  And again, I love Arpaio.
[1:24:45.860 --> 1:24:47.900]  Whether you love him or hating, it's illegal.
[1:24:47.900 --> 1:24:49.100]  Obama openly sued him.
[1:24:49.100 --> 1:24:50.420]  The UN came after him.
[1:24:50.420 --> 1:24:51.260]  They went after him.
[1:24:51.260 --> 1:24:52.460]  George Soros spent, what was it,
[1:24:52.460 --> 1:24:53.980]  30-something million against him?
[1:24:53.980 --> 1:24:55.220]  Publicly, we know of.
[1:24:55.220 --> 1:24:57.500]  So if they can do this to him, anybody can do it.
[1:24:57.500 --> 1:24:59.980]  This is a lynching of a great sheriff and a patriot
[1:24:59.980 --> 1:25:01.260]  and a friend of Donald Trump.
[1:25:01.260 --> 1:25:04.340]  So the great news is, good law enforcement
[1:25:04.340 --> 1:25:06.500]  is not going to sit here while they lie about Arpaio
[1:25:06.500 --> 1:25:08.340]  or President Trump.
[1:25:08.340 --> 1:25:11.460]  And Mike Zulu and Sheriff Arpaio
[1:25:11.460 --> 1:25:13.420]  are willing to come into Washington next week
[1:25:13.420 --> 1:25:15.820]  to brief members of the White House,
[1:25:15.820 --> 1:25:19.100]  members of Congress, Department of Justice.
[1:25:19.100 --> 1:25:21.340]  All they have to do at this point
[1:25:21.340 --> 1:25:26.340]  is ask the NSA to release the Project Dragonet Database,
[1:25:26.340 --> 1:25:28.300]  the millions of names of people
[1:25:28.300 --> 1:25:30.020]  who have been under electronic surveillance.
[1:25:30.020 --> 1:25:33.340]  And the president can review that if he wants privately.
[1:25:33.340 --> 1:25:35.300]  He should order them, give me the database.
[1:25:35.300 --> 1:25:37.340]  And he's already gotten it from you, but...
[1:25:37.340 --> 1:25:39.180]  Well, they've gotten the ones pertaining
[1:25:39.180 --> 1:25:40.660]  to the records of Donald Trump.
[1:25:40.660 --> 1:25:43.340]  Donald Trump's narrative, I think, changed last week
[1:25:43.340 --> 1:25:47.540]  when they realized that there were records showing
[1:25:47.540 --> 1:25:50.900]  he'd been wiretapped, electronic surveillance,
[1:25:50.900 --> 1:25:52.500]  in Trump Tower.
[1:25:52.500 --> 1:25:54.220]  But we've got, we've got in here...
[1:25:54.220 --> 1:25:55.220]  I've got to stop you.
[1:25:55.220 --> 1:25:56.820]  I'm going to give you the floor when I come back,
[1:25:56.820 --> 1:25:59.300]  but Dr. Corsi, you're a very humble man.
[1:25:59.300 --> 1:26:02.100]  I mean, you're the number one New York Times bestseller
[1:26:02.100 --> 1:26:04.820]  three times because of your intel connections.
[1:26:04.820 --> 1:26:08.420]  Folks, they call us fake news because we're so real.
[1:26:08.420 --> 1:26:10.100]  This is one of the biggest stories ever.
[1:26:10.100 --> 1:26:11.340]  Is this not one of the biggest stories
[1:26:11.340 --> 1:26:12.940]  of your career as a patriot?
[1:26:12.940 --> 1:26:14.940]  I mean, this is so big, I can't believe it.
[1:26:14.940 --> 1:26:16.380]  Of course, I knew this earlier in the week.
[1:26:16.380 --> 1:26:18.100]  I've had to just sit back and let you work,
[1:26:18.100 --> 1:26:19.660]  being very excited, obviously, about it.
[1:26:19.660 --> 1:26:21.380]  But seeing the president then respond,
[1:26:21.380 --> 1:26:23.540]  he checked with databases, they know.
[1:26:23.540 --> 1:26:26.260]  This is earth shaking that they've bet everything
[1:26:26.260 --> 1:26:28.980]  against us saying they didn't surveil him
[1:26:28.980 --> 1:26:31.380]  when they bragged they'd surveilled him two months ago.
[1:26:31.380 --> 1:26:33.220]  And now we have the documents.
[1:26:33.220 --> 1:26:35.540]  Well, and Alex, that's why I wanted to show you your record
[1:26:35.540 --> 1:26:38.140]  because you could verify the cell phone
[1:26:38.140 --> 1:26:40.060]  or the phone number, the address,
[1:26:40.060 --> 1:26:41.100]  which no one knows you had.
[1:26:41.100 --> 1:26:42.900]  It's an older address.
[1:26:42.900 --> 1:26:46.140]  And my old cell phone that nobody but family had, yeah.
[1:26:46.140 --> 1:26:49.580]  And he's going to recognize his cell phone numbers.
[1:26:49.580 --> 1:26:52.060]  He's going to recognize his father's phone numbers,
[1:26:52.060 --> 1:26:53.460]  his wife's phone numbers.
[1:26:53.460 --> 1:26:56.180]  His employees are going to recognize his employees
[1:26:56.180 --> 1:26:57.020]  phone numbers.
[1:26:57.020 --> 1:26:59.380]  Trump has called me from these numbers.
[1:27:00.380 --> 1:27:01.420]  Yes, he called you.
[1:27:01.420 --> 1:27:05.020]  I mean, I showed some of these numbers in Washington
[1:27:05.020 --> 1:27:06.580]  that people recognize them immediately
[1:27:06.580 --> 1:27:09.380]  as Trump's cell phone is in here.
[1:27:09.380 --> 1:27:11.140]  Trump's secretary?
[1:27:11.140 --> 1:27:13.140]  Secretary's in here.
[1:27:13.140 --> 1:27:14.860]  And every organization he owned.
[1:27:14.860 --> 1:27:19.300]  In fact, NSA was even wiretapping the summer house
[1:27:19.300 --> 1:27:22.020]  that Trump would stay in.
[1:27:22.020 --> 1:27:24.820]  They were wiretapping his golf courses
[1:27:24.820 --> 1:27:27.660]  and the people who ran the golf courses.
[1:27:27.660 --> 1:27:30.260]  They even at Mar-a-Lago know when he sold it,
[1:27:30.260 --> 1:27:31.820]  he kept a couple of apartments.
[1:27:31.820 --> 1:27:34.820]  They know how to target even those very rooms.
[1:27:34.820 --> 1:27:36.700]  Well, Mar-a-Lago is on these lists.
[1:27:36.700 --> 1:27:38.940]  He was being, Donald Trump was being
[1:27:38.940 --> 1:27:43.540]  under electronic surveillance in all through New York.
[1:27:43.540 --> 1:27:44.820]  And that's why he's so pissed.
[1:27:44.820 --> 1:27:48.380]  And that's why they've bet everything on saying he's a liar.
[1:27:48.380 --> 1:27:50.100]  And as Chicago operations,
[1:27:50.100 --> 1:27:52.460]  anywhere that they had Trump international,
[1:27:52.460 --> 1:27:54.500]  those were also being wiretapped.
[1:27:54.500 --> 1:27:57.060]  All of his offices over by the United Nations,
[1:27:57.060 --> 1:27:58.660]  they were being wiretapped.
[1:27:58.660 --> 1:28:01.100]  Operations that they had down on Wall Street
[1:28:01.100 --> 1:28:02.780]  were being wiretapped.
[1:28:02.780 --> 1:28:07.780]  And then Chicago, Florida, anywhere Trump showed up.
[1:28:07.900 --> 1:28:11.220]  And what really kind of shocked me was Ivana Trump,
[1:28:11.220 --> 1:28:15.300]  House of Ivana, with the address and the phone numbers
[1:28:15.300 --> 1:28:17.900]  show up on the list as under electronic surveillance
[1:28:17.900 --> 1:28:19.740]  starting in 2004.
[1:28:19.740 --> 1:28:24.740]  Now, I mean, again, this is project dragnet.
[1:28:24.860 --> 1:28:26.860]  And that's because he came out against the war.
[1:28:26.860 --> 1:28:29.740]  This is bipartisan attacks, but accelerates under Obama.
[1:28:29.740 --> 1:28:31.620]  So the big news is here,
[1:28:31.620 --> 1:28:34.660]  we've got him in documents surveilled in the Obama era,
[1:28:34.660 --> 1:28:36.500]  showing the whole media is discredited.
[1:28:37.460 --> 1:28:40.340]  And also, I mean, he also had already run for president.
[1:28:40.340 --> 1:28:41.620]  I mean, he's trying to run for president
[1:28:41.620 --> 1:28:43.100]  going back into the 90s.
[1:28:43.100 --> 1:28:45.020]  Roger Stone documents that.
[1:28:45.020 --> 1:28:48.180]  It is booked the making of the president in 2014.
[1:28:48.180 --> 1:28:50.620]  Donald Trump's been a public figure since the 1990s.
[1:28:50.620 --> 1:28:52.700]  That's right, I want to be clear for everybody's safety.
[1:28:52.700 --> 1:28:55.980]  The addresses they've published, I am no longer at.
[1:28:55.980 --> 1:28:58.900]  But they did publish one of my secret locations.
[1:29:00.340 --> 1:29:03.340]  National Defense Labs and Citizen Armor
[1:29:03.340 --> 1:29:06.180]  has given Info Wars the exclusive
[1:29:06.180 --> 1:29:08.860]  on distributing to the American people
[1:29:08.860 --> 1:29:11.180]  the true next generation in body armor.
[1:29:11.180 --> 1:29:14.140]  Basically, what we're bringing to the Info Wars team
[1:29:14.140 --> 1:29:18.100]  is a new line of dynamic, lightweight,
[1:29:18.100 --> 1:29:18.940]  body armor.
[1:29:18.940 --> 1:29:22.220]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear,
[1:29:22.220 --> 1:29:23.700]  more comfortable, and stronger
[1:29:23.700 --> 1:29:25.020]  than anything else on the market.
[1:29:25.020 --> 1:29:26.580]  You show when you talk to people
[1:29:26.580 --> 1:29:28.300]  that have been using this actually testing for years,
[1:29:28.300 --> 1:29:30.020]  people that currently are testing for us,
[1:29:30.020 --> 1:29:31.220]  they didn't just say outstanding.
[1:29:31.220 --> 1:29:32.180]  I mean, what they really say about them.
[1:29:32.180 --> 1:29:33.940]  They want to know, how do they get it?
[1:29:33.940 --> 1:29:34.940]  Where do they find it?
[1:29:34.940 --> 1:29:37.500]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies
[1:29:37.500 --> 1:29:38.700]  want to know the same thing.
[1:29:38.700 --> 1:29:42.660]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[1:29:42.660 --> 1:29:43.500]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[1:29:43.500 --> 1:29:44.540]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[1:29:44.540 --> 1:29:46.340]  It's got a 20 year warranty, it's waterproof.
[1:29:46.340 --> 1:29:47.460]  You can wear it, it's comfortable.
[1:29:47.460 --> 1:29:49.580]  And we shot everything you can imagine of it.
[1:29:49.580 --> 1:29:51.340]  Again, fund the Info Wars,
[1:29:51.340 --> 1:29:54.100]  get the game changing in nanotech boobs.

[1:31:01.660 --> 1:31:03.780]  There was a mighty nation
[1:31:03.780 --> 1:31:05.820]  rest above all of creation.
[1:31:05.820 --> 1:31:08.620]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[1:31:08.620 --> 1:31:10.140]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[1:31:10.140 --> 1:31:12.580]  The American system of justice must be changed
[1:31:12.580 --> 1:31:14.340]  to conform to the rest of the world.
[1:31:14.340 --> 1:31:17.140]  Individual rights will have to take a backseat
[1:31:17.140 --> 1:31:18.140]  if they're collected.
[1:31:18.140 --> 1:31:19.820]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[1:31:19.820 --> 1:31:21.300]  It's gonna be coming after you're done.
[1:31:21.300 --> 1:31:22.140]  Oh, yeah.
[1:31:22.140 --> 1:31:24.500]  I take it ain't gonna sit well down my way at all.
[1:31:24.500 --> 1:31:25.620]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[1:31:25.620 --> 1:31:27.980]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[1:31:27.980 --> 1:31:29.100]  They lost.
[1:31:29.100 --> 1:31:30.420]  We won.
[1:31:30.420 --> 1:31:32.380]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[1:31:32.380 --> 1:31:33.500]  It's time to ride, boss.
[1:31:33.500 --> 1:31:35.420]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[1:31:35.420 --> 1:31:36.700]  When I was a boy,
[1:31:36.700 --> 1:31:38.700]  it was okay to be proud of the flag,
[1:31:38.700 --> 1:31:41.420]  heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[1:31:41.420 --> 1:31:43.740]  And beef was for supper.

[1:33:33.660 --> 1:33:41.020]  Live from the infowarsteam.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:41.020 --> 1:33:42.500]  Now, I just noticed during the break
[1:33:42.500 --> 1:33:45.420]  that dredgerport.com linked to our article that's
[1:33:45.420 --> 1:33:47.100]  on infowarsteam.com.
[1:33:47.100 --> 1:33:49.740]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Donald Trump
[1:33:49.740 --> 1:33:51.180]  and his family.
[1:33:51.180 --> 1:33:55.220]  Bombshell Discovery shows targets of NSA project dragnet.
[1:33:55.220 --> 1:33:56.900]  Yes, I'm in the article, but I think
[1:33:56.900 --> 1:33:58.380]  we're going to change the headline to Donald Trump
[1:33:58.380 --> 1:33:58.940]  and his family.
[1:33:58.940 --> 1:34:01.140]  I don't quite frankly think I'm that important.
[1:34:01.140 --> 1:34:03.660]  Thank you for putting me in there, Dr. Corsi.
[1:34:03.660 --> 1:34:05.700]  But this is what law enforcement gave you.
[1:34:05.700 --> 1:34:07.420]  This is an admitted database.
[1:34:07.420 --> 1:34:09.180]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation and others
[1:34:09.180 --> 1:34:12.060]  have broken down, but it's the center column.
[1:34:12.060 --> 1:34:13.820]  North Korea is threatening to nuke Japan,
[1:34:13.820 --> 1:34:16.540]  and Korea right now, all hell's breaking loose.
[1:34:16.540 --> 1:34:18.180]  I just can't believe this.
[1:34:18.180 --> 1:34:21.740]  Mike Zulub headed up to Cold Case Posse
[1:34:21.740 --> 1:34:23.300]  for sheriff or pile for many years.
[1:34:23.300 --> 1:34:24.500]  It's such great work.
[1:34:24.500 --> 1:34:26.620]  And of course, he was formerly retired Bergen County
[1:34:26.620 --> 1:34:29.340]  and New Jersey detective and chief investigator
[1:34:29.340 --> 1:34:31.100]  for the Cold Case Posse.
[1:34:31.100 --> 1:34:34.060]  And so much more, he was, of course, exposed
[1:34:34.060 --> 1:34:36.420]  a whole fake birth certificate and the rest of it.
[1:34:36.420 --> 1:34:39.260]  But this isn't about being a talk show host.
[1:34:39.260 --> 1:34:41.740]  It's not about being up here and being famous.
[1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:43.500]  This is really big stuff, folks.
[1:34:43.500 --> 1:34:45.220]  This is real.
[1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:49.540]  And The New York Times admitted in four articles
[1:34:49.540 --> 1:34:53.900]  by one author in January that they were surveilling
[1:34:53.900 --> 1:34:56.380]  and using the archaic term, wiretapping Trump.
[1:34:56.380 --> 1:34:58.340]  He used it, and they said it's not called wiretapping.
[1:34:58.340 --> 1:35:00.020]  It's called intercepts or surveillance.
[1:35:00.020 --> 1:35:01.340]  It doesn't matter.
[1:35:01.340 --> 1:35:03.860]  The point is, every phone call with the president and Alexis
[1:35:03.860 --> 1:35:06.180]  recorded anyways, that was used against him.
[1:35:06.180 --> 1:35:07.900]  That's illegal, that's a leak.
[1:35:07.900 --> 1:35:09.500]  Instead of him getting them in trouble
[1:35:09.500 --> 1:35:12.020]  for what they've done, the Nixon type crap,
[1:35:13.180 --> 1:35:15.100]  they turn it around and say, he's crazy,
[1:35:15.100 --> 1:35:17.900]  all over the news, none of this is happening.
[1:35:18.940 --> 1:35:21.620]  So good patriotic law enforcement,
[1:35:21.620 --> 1:35:22.980]  in the last few weeks, I know,
[1:35:22.980 --> 1:35:25.420]  with Sheriff Arpaio outgoing,
[1:35:25.420 --> 1:35:29.380]  and of course, his former chief detective, Mike Zula,
[1:35:29.380 --> 1:35:30.620]  broke all this down.
[1:35:30.620 --> 1:35:33.420]  So he joins us via Skype, but of course he does.
[1:35:33.420 --> 1:35:36.340]  But it just reminded me when I saw Drudge linked to that.
[1:35:36.340 --> 1:35:37.820]  It was like six years ago it came out
[1:35:37.820 --> 1:35:40.340]  that the TSA had a secret database
[1:35:40.340 --> 1:35:42.620]  on Drudge and myself for criticizing him.
[1:35:43.620 --> 1:35:45.060]  Yeah, that's the article about detain.
[1:35:45.060 --> 1:35:46.980]  No, if you just search engine,
[1:35:46.980 --> 1:35:50.580]  it was a former congressman out of Atlanta.
[1:35:51.980 --> 1:35:54.220]  Yeah, that Bob Barr files lawsuits against TSA
[1:35:54.220 --> 1:35:56.700]  over Drudge controversy, because it's in the database,
[1:35:56.700 --> 1:35:58.900]  but the files are secret.
[1:35:58.900 --> 1:36:03.900]  So they're using surveillance against constitutional critics.
[1:36:04.820 --> 1:36:07.380]  It's not like we're some meth dealing motorcycle gang
[1:36:07.380 --> 1:36:09.380]  or something, or have criminal records.
[1:36:09.380 --> 1:36:11.140]  They're using it against Sheriff Arpaio,
[1:36:11.140 --> 1:36:12.340]  and that's the other big news.
[1:36:12.340 --> 1:36:14.660]  People say, okay, great Sheriff, great Patriot,
[1:36:14.660 --> 1:36:16.060]  but he's out of office, whatever.
[1:36:16.060 --> 1:36:17.660]  Targeted by George Soros.
[1:36:17.660 --> 1:36:20.180]  These files have him all over, his family, everything.
[1:36:20.180 --> 1:36:22.060]  His court case, which they knew at the time.
[1:36:22.060 --> 1:36:24.860]  Everything they were saying was known before they got
[1:36:24.860 --> 1:36:27.820]  in court, but Obama made it especially to go after him.
[1:36:27.820 --> 1:36:30.940]  Using NSA surveillance against a citizen,
[1:36:30.940 --> 1:36:35.220]  a federal officer, a good standing sheriff,
[1:36:35.220 --> 1:36:37.820]  to destroy him in a court case is so illegal.
[1:36:37.820 --> 1:36:39.140]  Do I have to explain that to people?
[1:36:39.140 --> 1:36:40.620]  How illegal that is?
[1:36:40.620 --> 1:36:43.180]  So the guarding and NSA files decoded.
[1:36:43.180 --> 1:36:44.340]  What the investigation means to you.
[1:36:44.340 --> 1:36:46.500]  We learned about Operation Dragnet.
[1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:48.580]  Now we learn, and I know Mike Zulow,
[1:36:48.580 --> 1:36:49.500]  thought he was coming on tomorrow.
[1:36:49.500 --> 1:36:52.100]  We had to launch this now because of security issues.
[1:36:52.100 --> 1:36:56.500]  So for the last 25 minutes, I want Dr. Corsi to take over,
[1:36:56.500 --> 1:36:58.460]  it's all interrupted if he doesn't.
[1:36:58.460 --> 1:37:00.060]  And then I get so excited here.
[1:37:00.060 --> 1:37:03.100]  And then of course, Mike, to go over this,
[1:37:03.100 --> 1:37:05.980]  and you guys break down what's most pertinent,
[1:37:05.980 --> 1:37:08.540]  but to say we're under threat,
[1:37:08.540 --> 1:37:10.660]  to say this is dangerous to even have this,
[1:37:10.660 --> 1:37:12.700]  or who gave it to us is risking their life.
[1:37:12.700 --> 1:37:14.220]  Isn't grandstanding, folks?
[1:37:14.220 --> 1:37:16.020]  You want people to fight for America?
[1:37:16.020 --> 1:37:16.860]  Or Pio did it.
[1:37:16.860 --> 1:37:19.140]  They spent 30 plus million to destroy him.
[1:37:19.140 --> 1:37:21.140]  Okay, they've gone after Mike.
[1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:22.140]  They've gone after Corsi.
[1:37:22.140 --> 1:37:22.980]  They've gone after me.
[1:37:22.980 --> 1:37:23.820]  I'm not bitching.
[1:37:23.820 --> 1:37:25.740]  I'm just saying, this is a war, folks.
[1:37:25.740 --> 1:37:26.900]  You wonder how people don't fight
[1:37:26.900 --> 1:37:28.100]  because they get intimidated.
[1:37:28.100 --> 1:37:31.940]  So Dr. Corsi, you take over and break this down with Mike.
[1:37:31.940 --> 1:37:33.020]  Great, is Mike here now?
[1:37:33.020 --> 1:37:33.860]  Do we have Mike on?
[1:37:33.860 --> 1:37:35.020]  Yes he is, Mike is here.
[1:37:35.020 --> 1:37:36.020]  Mike is here.
[1:37:37.060 --> 1:37:39.660]  Mike, why don't you go over the background
[1:37:39.660 --> 1:37:42.740]  of how you got this database to me
[1:37:42.740 --> 1:37:44.460]  and what we discovered about Donald Trump
[1:37:44.460 --> 1:37:47.340]  and how you realized Trump was in this database.
[1:37:47.340 --> 1:37:50.020]  That's right, Mike Zulow, take it over, my friend.
[1:37:50.020 --> 1:37:53.420]  Well, back in 2013, information came to us
[1:37:53.420 --> 1:37:56.820]  as we were conducting the birth certificate investigation
[1:37:56.820 --> 1:37:59.380]  that an individual by the name of Dennis Montgomery
[1:37:59.380 --> 1:38:02.420]  was looking to come forward as a whistleblower
[1:38:02.420 --> 1:38:04.700]  that he was in possession of the identities
[1:38:04.700 --> 1:38:09.700]  of 151,000 residents of Maricopa County.
[1:38:09.700 --> 1:38:12.980]  And it was also alluded to that he had information
[1:38:12.980 --> 1:38:16.620]  of millions of Americans, personal information,
[1:38:16.620 --> 1:38:18.300]  bank account information,
[1:38:18.300 --> 1:38:21.620]  and even it was alleged IRS information
[1:38:21.620 --> 1:38:25.540]  that he claimed was taken illegally
[1:38:25.540 --> 1:38:28.260]  by the federal government while he was employed
[1:38:28.260 --> 1:38:32.180]  as a contractor working for the NSA.
[1:38:32.180 --> 1:38:36.220]  In his employment, he was a computer software developer
[1:38:36.220 --> 1:38:40.300]  that developed and it is documented computer software
[1:38:40.300 --> 1:38:43.460]  programs that could breach computers undetected
[1:38:43.460 --> 1:38:47.060]  and that was utilized for legitimate government purposes
[1:38:47.060 --> 1:38:47.900]  in the beginning.
[1:38:47.900 --> 1:38:52.900]  Mr. Montgomery had a falling out at one time
[1:38:53.100 --> 1:38:57.500]  with the federal government and was hired back
[1:38:57.500 --> 1:39:01.580]  to continue his work and subsequently departed
[1:39:01.580 --> 1:39:03.820]  from there again.
[1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:06.060]  And when he came into the sheriff's office
[1:39:06.060 --> 1:39:10.340]  with this information, there were in fact 151,000 residents
[1:39:10.340 --> 1:39:13.940]  that he had their personal information.
[1:39:13.940 --> 1:39:17.740]  On top of that, what was shown to us was other individuals.
[1:39:17.740 --> 1:39:20.380]  Supreme Court justices, John Roberts was one.
[1:39:21.380 --> 1:39:24.380]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I believe was in the database
[1:39:24.380 --> 1:39:26.220]  that we were shown.
[1:39:27.260 --> 1:39:30.980]  We had senators, we had movie actors, Clint Eastwood.
[1:39:31.940 --> 1:39:33.580]  And Alex, you were in there.
[1:39:33.580 --> 1:39:35.580]  I was in there, Sharper Pio was in there
[1:39:35.580 --> 1:39:37.700]  and this is back in 2007.
[1:39:37.700 --> 1:39:40.100]  This is before we did any other investigative work
[1:39:40.100 --> 1:39:42.580]  on anything related to that birth certificate
[1:39:42.580 --> 1:39:43.420]  or anything else.
[1:39:43.420 --> 1:39:45.940]  This information was in there.
[1:39:45.940 --> 1:39:48.140]  Well, this is an identity problem.
[1:39:48.140 --> 1:39:50.860]  There's identity theft, people's information now
[1:39:50.860 --> 1:39:53.300]  are in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.
[1:39:53.300 --> 1:39:54.700]  That's a target list of anybody
[1:39:54.700 --> 1:39:57.460]  that might be a faithful, good American.
[1:39:57.460 --> 1:39:59.540]  Yes, I mean, Sharper Pio was in there.
[1:39:59.540 --> 1:40:01.620]  Our chief deputy was in there.
[1:40:01.620 --> 1:40:05.780]  So, Sharper Pio decided to open up an investigation
[1:40:05.780 --> 1:40:10.300]  from the perspective that we have to safeguard our residents.
[1:40:10.300 --> 1:40:13.060]  It turned out not only did he have 151,000 people
[1:40:13.060 --> 1:40:15.660]  in Maricopa County, but he had half a million people
[1:40:15.660 --> 1:40:17.420]  in the state of Arizona.
[1:40:17.420 --> 1:40:21.140]  It turned out that he had millions across the nation.
[1:40:21.140 --> 1:40:24.420]  Texas, California, New Jersey, Rhode Island.
[1:40:24.420 --> 1:40:25.820]  This sounds bigger than Snowden
[1:40:25.820 --> 1:40:27.500]  what's breaking right now.
[1:40:27.500 --> 1:40:29.260]  Well, and that's what's incredible.
[1:40:29.260 --> 1:40:31.980]  And let me tell you something about Mr. Montgomery.
[1:40:31.980 --> 1:40:36.180]  Mr. Montgomery, his credibility is challenged.
[1:40:36.180 --> 1:40:37.900]  And you have to understand now
[1:40:37.900 --> 1:40:40.340]  the agencies that he was working for.
[1:40:40.340 --> 1:40:44.260]  These people will destroy you in a heartbeat.
[1:40:44.260 --> 1:40:47.340]  But in the very beginning, Mr. Montgomery
[1:40:47.340 --> 1:40:49.420]  alerted myself and Detective Brian McAwits
[1:40:49.420 --> 1:40:52.820]  when we went to Seattle to interview him
[1:40:52.820 --> 1:40:57.460]  that the NSA was breaching attorney-client-privileged
[1:40:57.460 --> 1:40:59.380]  communications.
[1:40:59.380 --> 1:41:02.500]  And that was three or four months
[1:41:02.500 --> 1:41:06.700]  Alex before Snowden ever released that information.
[1:41:06.700 --> 1:41:08.660]  So he was telling us about that.
[1:41:08.660 --> 1:41:10.260]  He was also telling us about things
[1:41:10.260 --> 1:41:13.140]  that are breaking now in the news.
[1:41:13.140 --> 1:41:15.180]  So to sit back and look at this and think
[1:41:15.180 --> 1:41:19.220]  that the claims that the president of the United States
[1:41:19.220 --> 1:41:23.100]  is making are invalid, I can't believe that.
[1:41:23.100 --> 1:41:26.620]  Now, Montgomery's information was turned over
[1:41:26.620 --> 1:41:30.900]  by the sheriff's office pursuant to a subpoena
[1:41:30.900 --> 1:41:32.780]  in a federal case that was going on here,
[1:41:32.780 --> 1:41:35.980]  or Pio's civil trial for immigration.
[1:41:35.980 --> 1:41:39.940]  The investigation was then brought center stage
[1:41:39.940 --> 1:41:43.780]  and exposed in a public hearing.
[1:41:43.780 --> 1:41:47.740]  And this information, some of this, I actually testified to.
[1:41:47.740 --> 1:41:51.660]  This information was turned over to the ACLU, Covington
[1:41:51.660 --> 1:41:52.380]  Burling.
[1:41:52.380 --> 1:41:54.980]  It was turned over to the DOJ.
[1:41:54.980 --> 1:41:58.300]  At no time did any agency ever come back
[1:41:58.300 --> 1:42:01.340]  and discredit this information.
[1:42:01.340 --> 1:42:02.700]  As this case was going on.
[1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:03.820]  I just said to interrupt briefly.
[1:42:03.820 --> 1:42:04.820]  I'm going to come back and have you have the floor.
[1:42:04.820 --> 1:42:06.140]  And please come back for a full hour.
[1:42:06.140 --> 1:42:07.140]  We have tomorrow, sir.
[1:42:07.140 --> 1:42:08.340]  I'm not going to be busy.
[1:42:08.340 --> 1:42:09.780]  I remember hearing about this at the time.
[1:42:09.780 --> 1:42:10.380]  There's little pings.
[1:42:10.380 --> 1:42:11.340]  Hey, you're in a database.
[1:42:11.340 --> 1:42:12.500]  I'm like, yeah, no.
[1:42:12.500 --> 1:42:15.380]  So the point is, this has been going on for a while.
[1:42:15.380 --> 1:42:17.780]  And then to see president out there under attack,
[1:42:17.780 --> 1:42:19.700]  they admit they were surveilling him in the New York
[1:42:19.700 --> 1:42:21.020]  Times a month and a half ago.
[1:42:21.020 --> 1:42:22.260]  Now they say he's insane.
[1:42:22.260 --> 1:42:23.900]  Let me ask this, we got to break.
[1:42:23.900 --> 1:42:27.460]  Who do they say, how dumb do they think we are, Mike?
[1:42:27.460 --> 1:42:28.540]  Alex, I don't know.
[1:42:28.540 --> 1:42:30.660]  Because if they want to come out here
[1:42:30.660 --> 1:42:34.620]  and you have individuals from these agencies, these spy
[1:42:34.620 --> 1:42:37.940]  agencies, if you will, come out and lie to Congress
[1:42:37.940 --> 1:42:40.220]  and then have to retract it, eventually you
[1:42:40.220 --> 1:42:43.140]  have to come to the conclusion that this stuff is going on.
[1:42:43.140 --> 1:42:45.060]  And it truly is going on.
[1:42:45.060 --> 1:42:48.580]  And the information that we were privy to, like I said,
[1:42:48.580 --> 1:42:50.100]  has been turned over.
[1:42:50.100 --> 1:42:52.900]  We got Mr. Montgomery to a federal judge
[1:42:52.900 --> 1:42:54.460]  with the assistance of Larry Clayman.
[1:42:54.460 --> 1:42:57.100]  This is breaking all Larry Clayman, all of it.
[1:42:57.100 --> 1:42:58.580]  This is breaking right now, folks.
[1:42:58.580 --> 1:42:59.980]  Here at InfoWars, stay with us.
[1:42:59.980 --> 1:43:05.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:43:19.220 --> 1:43:22.220]  If you're receiving this broadcast, you are the resistance.
[1:43:25.220 --> 1:43:27.740]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:43:27.740 --> 1:43:30.140]  you are the resistance.
[1:43:30.140 --> 1:43:36.620]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:43:36.620 --> 1:43:38.900]  All right, I want to get Mike Zullo on to Mar for a full hour
[1:43:38.900 --> 1:43:41.660]  along with Dr. Corsi, Judge Arpaio, you name it.
[1:43:41.660 --> 1:43:43.500]  This is so big.
[1:43:43.500 --> 1:43:45.060]  It's probably one of the biggest things we ever broke.
[1:43:45.060 --> 1:43:48.220]  It's the top story now on DrudgeReport.com.
[1:43:48.220 --> 1:43:51.260]  When this show ends in 13 minutes,
[1:43:51.260 --> 1:43:59.220]  I'm going to add a link to the recording of the live feed
[1:43:59.220 --> 1:44:01.140]  as it loops so we can add it to the article.
[1:44:04.580 --> 1:44:08.220]  I want to go back to the top left link.
[1:44:08.220 --> 1:44:11.900]  We can blow that up for folks.
[1:44:11.900 --> 1:44:15.780]  NSA documents surveillance on Trump Family Moor project
[1:44:15.780 --> 1:44:16.860]  dragnet.
[1:44:16.860 --> 1:44:18.860]  I mean, really, the headline, that's powerful.
[1:44:18.860 --> 1:44:20.860]  Drudge always shows how to crystallize what's happening.
[1:44:20.860 --> 1:44:25.820]  That's really the headline for the whole broadcast today.
[1:44:25.820 --> 1:44:29.420]  But it's also new NSA whistleblower.
[1:44:29.420 --> 1:44:31.020]  And so I wondered what was going on.
[1:44:31.020 --> 1:44:36.020]  Corsi called me on Monday and said, OK, we got a database.
[1:44:36.020 --> 1:44:39.740]  I'm going to run it by people first because we got to check it.
[1:44:39.740 --> 1:44:42.620]  And I said, fine, I don't want to know about secret stuff.
[1:44:42.620 --> 1:44:46.900]  And then days later, we get a phone call
[1:44:46.900 --> 1:44:49.780]  from, let's just say, a former high-level person
[1:44:49.780 --> 1:44:53.180]  in the government, as high as you get under the president,
[1:44:53.180 --> 1:44:56.020]  basically threats just started pouring in about everything.
[1:44:56.020 --> 1:44:58.180]  We're going to get you, stop it, stop it, stop it.
[1:44:58.180 --> 1:45:01.660]  And I finally figured out when it's like former president's
[1:45:01.660 --> 1:45:03.100]  lawyers, I'll just say that you name it,
[1:45:03.100 --> 1:45:06.340]  all hell breaking laws, and then I have my lawyers call.
[1:45:06.340 --> 1:45:08.740]  They're scared on the phone when we talk to them.
[1:45:08.740 --> 1:45:10.580]  They're like, just stop.
[1:45:10.580 --> 1:45:11.940]  We don't have any problems.
[1:45:11.940 --> 1:45:13.980]  And I'm like, what the hell is going on here?
[1:45:13.980 --> 1:45:15.340]  And I go, oh my god, it's Corsi.
[1:45:15.340 --> 1:45:16.620]  And I'm like, what's going on?
[1:45:16.620 --> 1:45:18.900]  He goes, well, we're checking these databases and this NSA
[1:45:18.900 --> 1:45:20.620]  stuff, and we're going to find out what it is.
[1:45:20.620 --> 1:45:23.180]  And you're in, and I'm like, OK, let's just see what happens.
[1:45:23.180 --> 1:45:24.860]  The thing is, if you live in this all the time,
[1:45:24.860 --> 1:45:26.460]  you get to where the worst of the threat,
[1:45:26.460 --> 1:45:27.940]  you almost take it like it's no big deal.
[1:45:27.940 --> 1:45:29.460]  That's how you psychologically deal with it,
[1:45:29.460 --> 1:45:31.740]  and still put hamburgers for your kids or whatever.
[1:45:31.740 --> 1:45:34.500]  And so now we're in this twilight zone phase,
[1:45:34.500 --> 1:45:36.740]  where they're going to try to deny this whatever.
[1:45:36.740 --> 1:45:37.620]  It's just crazy.
[1:45:37.620 --> 1:45:39.700]  It's like they denied that they were spying on Trump,
[1:45:39.700 --> 1:45:41.460]  when they admitted they were spying on Trump.
[1:45:41.460 --> 1:45:44.380]  So Mike Zula, again, of the cold case posse,
[1:45:44.380 --> 1:45:45.860]  and what happened to our pile yourself,
[1:45:45.860 --> 1:45:47.340]  we got like seven, eight minutes left,
[1:45:47.340 --> 1:45:48.380]  please come on, Demara.
[1:45:48.380 --> 1:45:50.020]  Please, all of you, cover this.
[1:45:50.020 --> 1:45:52.060]  But clearly, all hell's breaking loose,
[1:45:52.060 --> 1:45:53.660]  when they had you all surveilled this week,
[1:45:53.660 --> 1:45:55.260]  because I'm busy, and you're busy,
[1:45:55.260 --> 1:45:57.100]  but I kind of like stuff cooked on the burner,
[1:45:57.100 --> 1:45:59.300]  because I don't know what's going to happen with it.
[1:45:59.300 --> 1:46:02.140]  But let me tell you, this is really scared some people.
[1:46:02.140 --> 1:46:04.620]  Where do you think this is going?
[1:46:04.620 --> 1:46:07.540]  You know, Alex, like I said, this information was turned over.
[1:46:07.540 --> 1:46:09.700]  We were successful with Larry Klayman
[1:46:09.700 --> 1:46:12.620]  and getting Mr. Montgomery to a federal judge.
[1:46:12.620 --> 1:46:15.460]  And ultimately, Larry Klayman got him to the FBI.
[1:46:15.460 --> 1:46:17.420]  And by the way, what a rock star, Larry Klayman.
[1:46:17.420 --> 1:46:19.580]  He has just devastated them on hundreds of fronts.
[1:46:19.580 --> 1:46:20.940]  We're not giving credit here, it's just,
[1:46:20.940 --> 1:46:22.780]  this is another patriot.
[1:46:22.780 --> 1:46:23.860]  Well, Larry's a patriot.
[1:46:23.860 --> 1:46:27.100]  And he moved heaven and earth
[1:46:27.100 --> 1:46:28.820]  to get Mr. Montgomery there.
[1:46:28.820 --> 1:46:30.620]  That's over two years ago.
[1:46:30.620 --> 1:46:33.500]  And no one has heard anything about this.
[1:46:33.500 --> 1:46:34.340]  Now-
[1:46:34.340 --> 1:46:35.300]  Has it all got sealed inside court?
[1:46:35.300 --> 1:46:36.980]  So tell us, you've got the database,
[1:46:36.980 --> 1:46:40.020]  we put out excerpts, this totally proves what Trump's saying.
[1:46:40.020 --> 1:46:41.820]  No, I want to be clear, we don't have the database.
[1:46:41.820 --> 1:46:42.660]  What you have to-
[1:46:42.660 --> 1:46:44.620]  You have the screenshots of the entries of the database.
[1:46:44.620 --> 1:46:47.100]  We have information that Montgomery gave us.
[1:46:47.100 --> 1:46:48.700]  That's been turned over.
[1:46:48.700 --> 1:46:49.540]  Yes.
[1:46:49.540 --> 1:46:53.740]  This is Montgomery's rendition of God knows what.
[1:46:53.740 --> 1:46:55.420]  But it's clearly thousands of pages
[1:46:55.420 --> 1:46:56.820]  of screenshots of databases.
[1:46:56.820 --> 1:46:59.060]  So, well, you're the expert as a detective.
[1:46:59.060 --> 1:47:00.660]  Tell us what it is.
[1:47:00.660 --> 1:47:04.020]  It's Montgomery's rendition of whatever information
[1:47:04.020 --> 1:47:04.980]  he was privy to.
[1:47:04.980 --> 1:47:06.980]  And that way, legally, we don't have secret documents.
[1:47:06.980 --> 1:47:08.820]  This is what your witness, Montgomery said.
[1:47:08.820 --> 1:47:10.460]  No, we don't have secret documents.
[1:47:10.460 --> 1:47:12.980]  Montgomery turned over, I believe,
[1:47:12.980 --> 1:47:15.580]  the seven hard drives to the FBI.
[1:47:15.580 --> 1:47:16.820]  Now, that's-
[1:47:16.820 --> 1:47:18.500]  And now, clearly, Trump's the president.
[1:47:18.500 --> 1:47:19.500]  He knows about this.
[1:47:19.500 --> 1:47:20.820]  Corsi tells him about it.
[1:47:20.820 --> 1:47:21.820]  Trump comes out and says,
[1:47:21.820 --> 1:47:23.220]  I'm going public in the next week.
[1:47:24.260 --> 1:47:25.660]  That's what I understand.
[1:47:25.660 --> 1:47:26.660]  Yes.
[1:47:26.660 --> 1:47:27.660]  You're the expert.
[1:47:27.660 --> 1:47:29.060]  Just please, it's all in a rub.
[1:47:29.060 --> 1:47:30.540]  Tell us what else we need to know.
[1:47:30.540 --> 1:47:31.700]  Well, the fact is-
[1:47:31.700 --> 1:47:32.700]  I'm done with Corsi jumping in.
[1:47:32.700 --> 1:47:33.700]  Sorry, go ahead, Doc.
[1:47:33.700 --> 1:47:34.540]  Jump in.
[1:47:34.540 --> 1:47:38.060]  I mean, I made sure the White House had this early last week.
[1:47:38.060 --> 1:47:40.060]  I think we did it on Monday, Tuesday.
[1:47:40.060 --> 1:47:43.260]  And I looked top people in the White House know what was coming.
[1:47:43.260 --> 1:47:45.860]  The story was breaking.
[1:47:45.860 --> 1:47:50.980]  Now, the records that we have are proof out.
[1:47:50.980 --> 1:47:53.500]  In fact, Alex, I just emailed in to you
[1:47:53.500 --> 1:47:55.060]  so you can have printed out in the studio.
[1:47:55.060 --> 1:47:56.620]  You can see what the records look like.
[1:47:56.620 --> 1:47:57.740]  I've got some of them.
[1:47:57.740 --> 1:47:59.420]  Yeah, put me the rest up.
[1:47:59.420 --> 1:48:00.420]  Here they are.
[1:48:00.420 --> 1:48:01.620]  I don't want to show too much of this.
[1:48:01.620 --> 1:48:02.620]  Don't show it.
[1:48:02.620 --> 1:48:03.620]  Yeah, it's got-
[1:48:03.620 --> 1:48:04.620]  Go ahead.
[1:48:04.620 --> 1:48:07.580]  These are database records.
[1:48:07.580 --> 1:48:11.180]  And the key, and I think I want to make sure we end well at this point,
[1:48:11.180 --> 1:48:12.500]  is that I was in-
[1:48:12.500 --> 1:48:15.700]  And this is confidential document, government eyes only.
[1:48:15.700 --> 1:48:17.860]  I was in Washington last week.
[1:48:17.860 --> 1:48:25.220]  And what we did is we sent out, I met with a top member of the House of Representatives.
[1:48:25.220 --> 1:48:28.900]  We met with a couple of, you know, to get the word onto Congress
[1:48:28.900 --> 1:48:31.140]  that we want to meet with the Department of Justice.
[1:48:31.140 --> 1:48:32.620]  I'm going to have another article of-
[1:48:32.620 --> 1:48:34.740]  By the way, I'm going to cover this, but I'm going to show the top of it.
[1:48:34.740 --> 1:48:35.740]  Look at this.
[1:48:35.740 --> 1:48:38.580]  Project Dragonet Master Database Records.
[1:48:38.580 --> 1:48:40.180]  Let's keep going, Doc.
[1:48:40.180 --> 1:48:45.620]  Well, I want to show, you know, tomorrow we have the information, as you said, of the
[1:48:45.620 --> 1:48:52.900]  wiretapping of our PIO's court case, in which the lawyers, you know, were basically going
[1:48:52.900 --> 1:48:58.780]  forward with information that was being wiretapped, what the lawyers were being wiretapped, things
[1:48:58.780 --> 1:49:05.700]  were going forward, you know, that the Department of Justice was intervening with the judges.
[1:49:05.700 --> 1:49:08.740]  The Sheriff of our PIO was wiretapped during the trial.
[1:49:08.740 --> 1:49:11.220]  And that's what Mike Zula was starting to get at.
[1:49:11.220 --> 1:49:15.660]  Just that alone, they knew about from their source, then it came out in the news in the
[1:49:15.660 --> 1:49:16.660]  Snowden dump.
[1:49:16.660 --> 1:49:18.260]  Let's go back to him and then back to you.
[1:49:18.260 --> 1:49:23.380]  And then, first, finally, we want to come in, we'd like to come into Washington next
[1:49:23.380 --> 1:49:25.420]  week and present this information.
[1:49:25.420 --> 1:49:29.220]  I think National Press Club, regardless, because the people will scare Trump and say,
[1:49:29.220 --> 1:49:31.820]  oh, look out, stay away, it might not be totally accurate.
[1:49:31.820 --> 1:49:32.900]  I think you should be at the Press Club.
[1:49:32.900 --> 1:49:33.900]  I should come up there, too.
[1:49:33.900 --> 1:49:37.380]  Well, I think we should organize, and to the Department of Justice.
[1:49:37.380 --> 1:49:39.780]  I want to get into the Department of Justice.
[1:49:39.780 --> 1:49:47.260]  This information, now that I think the White House is aware that this project, Dragnet,
[1:49:47.260 --> 1:49:53.260]  we have reason to believe, had been wiretapping Trump and his family back to 2004.
[1:49:53.260 --> 1:49:56.460]  And again, where would an NSA whistleblower go?
[1:49:56.460 --> 1:50:00.460]  They would go to Sheriff Arpaio, who was then the only law enforcement officer that had
[1:50:00.460 --> 1:50:05.100]  any courage in this country, other than maybe the Sheriff up in Milwaukee.
[1:50:05.100 --> 1:50:07.580]  Do you want to comment on that, Detective?
[1:50:07.580 --> 1:50:13.180]  Well, I think that's precisely why Sheriff Arpaio was approached.
[1:50:13.180 --> 1:50:16.500]  And like I said, in the beginning, look, nobody-
[1:50:16.500 --> 1:50:19.660]  And notice, as soon as you got this info, all hell broke loose.
[1:50:19.660 --> 1:50:20.660]  Oh, yeah.
[1:50:20.660 --> 1:50:21.660]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:50:21.660 --> 1:50:22.660]  Absolutely.
[1:50:22.660 --> 1:50:29.620]  I mean, there's evidence that we had turned over that Sheriff Arpaio's phones were wiretapped.
[1:50:29.620 --> 1:50:33.860]  That evidence has been turned over to federal authorities, and nobody says anything about
[1:50:33.860 --> 1:50:34.860]  it.
[1:50:34.860 --> 1:50:35.860]  Wow.
[1:50:35.860 --> 1:50:36.860]  Wow.
[1:50:36.860 --> 1:50:40.460]  Well, I think they've bitten off more than they could chew, and I'm trying to add confidence.
[1:50:40.460 --> 1:50:43.700]  We've got the President, the numbers show that people are away.
[1:50:43.700 --> 1:50:46.860]  That's why they're so scared, though, Mike, is they know we're away.
[1:50:46.860 --> 1:50:52.420]  Well, I think that it's a hard thing to start to cover up when you get caught lying and
[1:50:52.420 --> 1:50:53.420]  lying and lying.
[1:50:53.420 --> 1:50:55.260]  I think it's difficult to cover it up.
[1:50:55.260 --> 1:50:58.980]  I heard you earlier talking about parallel construction.
[1:50:58.980 --> 1:51:01.060]  I mean, that's what a lot of this is.
[1:51:01.060 --> 1:51:05.460]  You know, it's been explained to me that the way you could be targeted is they would take
[1:51:05.460 --> 1:51:10.220]  mass amounts of information all around you, but just to focus in on you.
[1:51:10.220 --> 1:51:11.900]  So it doesn't look like you were targeted.
[1:51:11.900 --> 1:51:12.900]  Exactly.
[1:51:12.900 --> 1:51:17.780]  I mean, this is something that has to be really exposed and corrected now.
[1:51:17.780 --> 1:51:19.380]  And I want to be really clear.
[1:51:19.380 --> 1:51:23.660]  I don't believe everyone in these agencies is a bad actor.
[1:51:23.660 --> 1:51:26.660]  I don't believe every one of these agencies is out to show-
[1:51:26.660 --> 1:51:27.660]  Sure.
[1:51:27.660 --> 1:51:30.300]  There'll be morning briefings that we're enemies out to bring down their agencies.
[1:51:30.300 --> 1:51:31.300]  No, we're not.
[1:51:31.300 --> 1:51:34.700]  They're trying to bring down the president that's got $3 trillion of the stock market
[1:51:34.700 --> 1:51:36.580]  trying to make America great again.
[1:51:36.580 --> 1:51:38.500]  He's been surveilled illegally.
[1:51:38.500 --> 1:51:40.700]  Let's go after the criminals at the top.
[1:51:40.700 --> 1:51:43.820]  Well, you know, you have to look at it from another perspective.
[1:51:43.820 --> 1:51:46.740]  I mean, you have to look at it and realize something.
[1:51:46.740 --> 1:51:49.740]  You know, Donald Trump did not have to do this.
[1:51:49.740 --> 1:51:52.540]  Donald Trump isn't getting compensated to do this.
[1:51:52.540 --> 1:51:56.860]  Donald Trump is in the best years of his life, and he's dedicating it to his country.
[1:51:56.860 --> 1:51:59.980]  And everything is being thrown out to man.
[1:51:59.980 --> 1:52:05.380]  So my position is on this, is this information was turned over in federal court, it's been
[1:52:05.380 --> 1:52:09.500]  turned over to the FBI, Montgomery deserves some type of hearing.
[1:52:09.500 --> 1:52:13.460]  So Montgomery is the new Snowden, and you're here now for the first time.
[1:52:13.460 --> 1:52:14.460]  His name is now known.
[1:52:14.460 --> 1:52:17.180]  They've tried to keep it secret, now it's known.
[1:52:17.180 --> 1:52:19.420]  He just needs to get his day in front of us.
[1:52:19.420 --> 1:52:20.420]  Briefly.
[1:52:20.420 --> 1:52:21.420]  Tell us about this man.
[1:52:21.420 --> 1:52:23.900]  Tell us his full book right now in like one minute again.
[1:52:23.900 --> 1:52:29.220]  Well, Dennis Montgomery has credibility issues because of things that were done to him.
[1:52:29.220 --> 1:52:33.500]  You know, whether or not any of that stuff is legitimate or not, they're going to use
[1:52:33.500 --> 1:52:34.500]  it.
[1:52:34.500 --> 1:52:35.500]  They're going to use it.
[1:52:35.500 --> 1:52:39.140]  But the fact of the matter is, even bad guys have truthful information.
[1:52:39.140 --> 1:52:41.140]  That's just the truth.
[1:52:41.140 --> 1:52:44.460]  Well, how the hell would he get all the real phone numbers to me and Ronald Trump and everybody
[1:52:44.460 --> 1:52:45.460]  else?
[1:52:45.460 --> 1:52:49.620]  Montgomery, Alex Montgomery tried, like I believe it's 12 times, if not more, to become
[1:52:49.620 --> 1:52:53.700]  a whistleblower and was turned away every step of the way.
[1:52:53.700 --> 1:52:57.820]  Well, it's like the database hacking people on the people at Diable that were hired for
[1:52:57.820 --> 1:53:01.620]  that, they would go hire people that even had convictions and stuff to run their programs
[1:53:01.620 --> 1:53:04.340]  because then they could just deny that, you know, oh, you're a crook, we don't listen to
[1:53:04.340 --> 1:53:05.340]  you.
[1:53:05.340 --> 1:53:07.140]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:53:07.140 --> 1:53:09.980]  And that that seems to be what what is going on.
[1:53:09.980 --> 1:53:11.420]  You never plug anything when you come on.
[1:53:11.420 --> 1:53:12.420]  You're such a great guy.
[1:53:12.420 --> 1:53:13.420]  Is there a Facebook or Twitter?
[1:53:13.420 --> 1:53:15.100]  How do people stay in contact with you?
[1:53:15.100 --> 1:53:16.100]  I don't.
[1:53:16.100 --> 1:53:18.100]  I don't really want people to stay in contact with me.
[1:53:18.100 --> 1:53:19.100]  I understand you're a patriot.
[1:53:19.100 --> 1:53:20.100]  Will you come on tomorrow?
[1:53:20.100 --> 1:53:21.100]  I know you're busy.
[1:53:21.100 --> 1:53:22.100]  Yeah, I will.
[1:53:22.100 --> 1:53:23.100]  It's going to be huge tomorrow.
[1:53:23.100 --> 1:53:24.540]  Dr. Corsi, I know you've got an email and info wars.
[1:53:24.540 --> 1:53:27.100]  How do folks contact you with whistleblowing contacts you know?
[1:53:27.100 --> 1:53:34.580]  We're seeing the next Snowden here was it's Dr. C at info wars.com Dr. C. I want to thank
[1:53:34.580 --> 1:53:35.580]  the crew want to thank you.
[1:53:35.580 --> 1:53:37.460]  I'm very honored to be associated with all this.
[1:53:37.460 --> 1:53:41.780]  Thanks to Drudge report.com linking to this will have more out tonight on this and more
[1:53:41.780 --> 1:53:46.420]  tomorrow 11 a.m. Central if the deep state doesn't swat team us and I'm serious stay
[1:53:46.420 --> 1:53:58.940]  with us retransmission starts now.
