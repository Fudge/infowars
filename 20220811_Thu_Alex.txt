[00:00.000 --> 00:28.320]  We're finally here. We're inside the New World Order. A tyrannical corporate world government
[00:28.320 --> 00:34.240]  is publicly taking over the planet, cutting off the resources and imploding the borders.
[00:34.240 --> 00:40.600]  And Info Wars is under more attack than even major presidents that have been resisting the
[00:40.600 --> 00:47.560]  globalists like Bolsonaro and Trump. And why is that? Because they see me and Info Wars
[00:47.560 --> 00:53.760]  as the archetypal populist threat to their system. And they've been able to trace back
[00:53.760 --> 00:58.080]  much of the modern movements fighting them to us. And that means to you, the viewers
[00:58.080 --> 01:01.840]  and listeners. When Trump says they've got to get through him to get to you, he's telling
[01:01.840 --> 01:06.200]  the truth. And when I tell you they've got to get through me to get to you, that's exactly
[01:06.200 --> 01:10.400]  what's happening. So I wanted to thank you today for your prayers, for your support and
[01:10.400 --> 01:15.400]  for your steadfast dedication to freedom and your defense of Info Wars. We are a family.
[01:15.400 --> 01:22.560]  We are in this together. And we're going to be persecuted because we stand in the way
[01:22.560 --> 01:27.080]  of the New World Order having its way with our children with their entire anti-human
[01:27.080 --> 01:33.720]  transhumanist agenda. So again, I wanted to take a few minutes out to just let you know
[01:33.720 --> 01:39.480]  how much I appreciate you and how amazing this fight has been that we've been in together.
[01:39.480 --> 01:45.600]  And now as we prepare to enter the depths of hell, as a nation and as a world, as we
[01:45.600 --> 01:51.320]  go into the fabled New World Order predicted in revelations of the Bible, it's more important
[01:51.320 --> 01:54.880]  than ever to understand that God that made the universe and made us is in control. And
[01:54.880 --> 02:00.480]  this is part of his plan to test us and to test the faithful. I'm not perfect. You're
[02:00.480 --> 02:05.760]  not perfect. But we actually love God. We love justice and we love the truth. Think
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.440]  about Marilyn Albright, Hillary Clinton's mentor bragging to Leslie Stallum, 60 minutes
[02:10.440 --> 02:15.680]  that, yeah, she ordered the sanctions that killed 500,000 children. And it was a good
[02:15.680 --> 02:21.280]  price to pay. That's who these godless, bloodthirsty, evil people are who claim they have the
[02:21.280 --> 02:25.480]  moral high ground and try to tell us how to run our lives, how to raise our children.
[02:25.480 --> 02:30.880]  And we stand in defiance of them and we've had incredible success together, resisting
[02:30.880 --> 02:38.640]  their tyranny. But the greatest tests are now upon us. So please today and tomorrow and
[02:38.640 --> 02:45.680]  next week, spend a few minutes every day in quiet contemplation, as I do, thinking about
[02:45.680 --> 02:50.440]  the cost that innocent children are paying around the world as they starve to death by
[02:50.440 --> 02:54.800]  the tens of millions because of the lockdowns that were put in place by the IMF and World
[02:54.800 --> 03:00.400]  Bank. It's those central banks that are now preparing new lockdowns. And that's why we've
[03:00.400 --> 03:06.600]  got to stay on air to be able to oppose these monsters because our credibility has exploded.
[03:06.600 --> 03:09.960]  We were supposed to already be off the air by now. The globalists knew that once they're
[03:09.960 --> 03:14.320]  planning to operation, everybody would look back at our films and our articles and our
[03:14.320 --> 03:19.080]  reports and our warnings and the thousands of interviews with experts and would understand
[03:19.080 --> 03:24.720]  that submitting to the new world order and the crises they're creating only puts us deeper
[03:24.720 --> 03:30.680]  into their control and only makes the chains that much tighter and heavier. The only solution
[03:30.680 --> 03:36.680]  is getting back to God. The only solution is understanding and committing that we must
[03:36.680 --> 03:42.680]  prevail against this tyranny. God's watching. The children are counting on us. And I again
[03:42.680 --> 03:47.320]  wanted to spend a few minutes thanking you for your steadfast support and I wanted to
[03:47.320 --> 03:50.880]  ask you again to re-double your efforts to share the articles and the videos and the
[03:50.880 --> 03:56.640]  reports for infowars.com and Bandai Video because the enemy hates it, the enemy fears
[03:56.640 --> 04:02.520]  it, and the enemy knows that if the truth comes to get out, their program will fail.
[04:02.520 --> 04:06.600]  All over the world, the new world order is running into massive opposition. They admit
[04:06.600 --> 04:11.240]  they're in deep trouble. And that is because of your incredible efforts here at The Spirit.
[04:11.240 --> 04:15.880]  So for myself and the entire InfoWars family and you, our family, I salute you and I thank
[04:15.880 --> 04:20.880]  you. God bless and good luck.
[04:20.880 --> 04:31.320]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say, I don't know what's going
[04:31.320 --> 04:37.320]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[04:37.320 --> 05:02.320]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alec Jones.

[05:56.080 --> 06:08.000]  available at infowarsstore.com.
[06:08.000 --> 06:37.440]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer. I've
[06:37.440 --> 06:48.880]  been thrust into the host chair today and I've got some big developing news stories,
[06:48.880 --> 06:57.640]  but they're so much bigger than just a 24 hour news cycle or even a week news cycle or even
[06:57.640 --> 07:07.040]  a month news cycle. We're talking about world changing, world altering events that are happening
[07:07.040 --> 07:17.200]  right now. And when I just kind of look at the waterfront of it all, it really is every
[07:17.200 --> 07:29.320]  issue is now a pivotal choice for the American people or for the world rather, but let's
[07:29.320 --> 07:35.640]  just say for the American people on where we want to go. Do we want to have a medical
[07:35.640 --> 07:43.020]  tyranny where our corrupt establishment can basically just send us to death with a vaccine?
[07:43.020 --> 07:48.640]  Do we want to have a government tyranny where you can just be politically persecuted if
[07:48.640 --> 07:56.000]  the regime sees so fit to destroy your life? Do we want to have an education system for
[07:56.000 --> 08:02.720]  our youth that's not an education system, but in fact an indoctrination system and on
[08:02.720 --> 08:12.200]  the more darker side of it, a sexual grooming system where they just groom children for
[08:12.200 --> 08:25.480]  their own sexual desires in the classroom? And everything I just said is clear and present
[08:25.480 --> 08:38.120]  right now, right now. And I've got all the examples. You've got Steve Kirsch who was
[08:38.120 --> 08:46.920]  on Fox News last night talking about how he can no longer be a Democrat and he talks
[08:46.920 --> 08:50.600]  about the vaccine. I think it's obviously deeper than that, but he talks about this
[08:50.600 --> 08:56.520]  deadly vaccine, how many people are hurting, how many people have been killed. And so when
[08:56.520 --> 09:04.920]  you see the World Economic Forum advisor, Yuval Harari say, we just don't need the vast majority
[09:04.920 --> 09:09.760]  of the population in today's world. You have to understand this is what Info Wars has been
[09:09.760 --> 09:16.920]  warning about. This is what Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Yuval Harari are telling
[09:16.920 --> 09:24.680]  you. You're not needed. They own the planet. You're dead. Or you might as well be dead
[09:24.680 --> 09:36.360]  as far as they're concerned. There are demons among us. And it's wild. I'm sitting at dinner
[09:36.360 --> 09:44.880]  last night with some friends and we're just talking about how liberals are grooming children
[09:44.880 --> 09:51.720]  sexually in classrooms and just how disgusting and how sick and how twisted that is. And
[09:51.720 --> 09:55.320]  we're at a decently busy restaurant and we're just like, you know, what's even weirder?
[09:55.320 --> 10:03.640]  Some of those freaks are in the restaurant with us right now. I think that's a good idea
[10:03.640 --> 10:09.600]  to teach a six-year-old girl or a six-year-old boy all about different sex types and sex
[10:09.600 --> 10:15.240]  toys and sex orientations and all about the sex the teachers have over the weekend with
[10:15.240 --> 10:25.400]  their sex partners. Make them pledge allegiance to the gay flag in Pride Month. You're like,
[10:25.400 --> 10:36.080]  wow, that's despicable. That's really fudged up. But they're everywhere. They're liberals.
[10:36.080 --> 10:41.600]  They're Democrats. They're here. And they're destroying us. But see, people are really
[10:41.600 --> 10:46.840]  starting to wake up and understand just how evil the regime is, just how corrupt the Bidens
[10:46.840 --> 10:53.200]  are and the true intent of the Democrat Party right now in America. And so here is Steve
[10:53.200 --> 11:01.160]  Kirsch who's been a lifelong Democrat and a Democrat mega donor discussing why he can
[11:01.160 --> 11:04.600]  no longer be a Democrat last night on Fox News.
[11:04.600 --> 11:09.760]  Here, Steve Kirsch was a Democratic Party mega donor. He says he's given more than $20
[11:09.760 --> 11:14.400]  million to help elect Democrats. And now he might just be jumping ship. Steve Kirsch
[11:14.400 --> 11:19.520]  is an entrepreneur, self-made success story. Enjoy this now to explain his reasoning. Steve,
[11:19.520 --> 11:23.360]  when did the Democratic Party start going south with you?
[11:23.360 --> 11:32.120]  Well, when they violated my trust, Brian. They told the agencies, the FDA, the CDC,
[11:32.120 --> 11:36.120]  the NIH said that these vaccines were safe and effective. And when I started seeing
[11:36.120 --> 11:42.520]  my friends die and be injured and I started looking at the data, there was no question
[11:42.520 --> 11:49.520]  that this vaccine is the most dangerous vaccine ever created by man. It is 1,000 times more
[11:49.520 --> 11:54.360]  deadly than the smallpox vaccine. And that's too unsafe for people to use. And I could
[11:54.360 --> 12:00.640]  not get even a single minute in front of any Democratic congressman. The best I got was
[12:00.640 --> 12:07.200]  that Rokon gave me to a staff member who took two months to get back to me. And when I asked
[12:07.200 --> 12:12.240]  if she had read what I had sent her, she said, no, it disagreed with the CDC. So it's not
[12:12.240 --> 12:18.240]  right. And so I didn't really read it. So that's as far as I ever got.
[12:18.240 --> 12:21.600]  But you didn't stop there. You did your own research. What did you find? What did you
[12:21.600 --> 12:25.720]  find was effective? And what was the reaction when you put it out there?
[12:25.720 --> 12:33.400]  Well, what I found was that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed by this vaccine
[12:33.400 --> 12:40.600]  and millions have been injured. And, you know, they're clearly, you are more likely to be
[12:40.600 --> 12:45.920]  injured or dead from the vaccine than if you were unvaccinated. So what they're saying
[12:45.920 --> 12:52.240]  and what the reality is, is completely opposite. There is a conservative radio show commentator
[12:52.240 --> 12:58.920]  his name is Wayne Root. He had a wedding eight months ago, and he had about half conservatives.
[12:58.920 --> 13:04.880]  And they're all pretty much conservatives, okay, but half were vaccinated and half were
[13:04.880 --> 13:12.120]  not vaccinated. And he found that of the hundred people that were vaccinated, he had 26 people
[13:12.120 --> 13:17.840]  who were seriously injured. And he had seven people who died. And in the unvaccinated group,
[13:17.840 --> 13:22.840]  he had zero and zero. So see, yeah, we don't know. That is statistically impossible, right?
[13:22.840 --> 13:28.480]  If the vaccines are safe, right? So we don't we. Now, Brian Kilmeade is a bit of an establishment
[13:28.480 --> 13:34.120]  hack, in my opinion, who is a conservative commentator on Fox News, hosting for Tucker
[13:34.120 --> 13:42.480]  Carlson, who's off this week. But thank God for Tucker Carlson's crew, getting Steve
[13:42.480 --> 13:50.320]  Kirsch on. And thank God for the gumption that Tucker Carlson and his show has for making
[13:50.320 --> 13:57.160]  sure the truth gets told, even though you know some of the big sponsors, corporate ad
[13:57.160 --> 14:03.440]  buyers and top execs at Fox probably don't like them bashing the vaccine like that.
[14:03.440 --> 14:09.200]  But what have I been saying this week? We've been tuning into the war room, I said, Fox
[14:09.200 --> 14:17.240]  News at night sounds more like info wars this week than ever before, than ever before. So
[14:17.240 --> 14:23.840]  that's kind of the time period we're in now. We're in the info wars paradigm of understanding
[14:23.840 --> 14:33.120]  current events, politics, more so than ever before. And it was the raid of Mar-a-Lago
[14:33.120 --> 14:41.440]  really that pushed the Overton window that far. And so I see that as a great victory.
[14:41.440 --> 14:47.640]  I see that as the reinforcements arriving. I see that as the truth finally rising to
[14:47.640 --> 14:53.720]  the top, despite the attempts to chill free speech, censor free speech, bully, intimidate
[14:53.720 --> 14:59.120]  and terrorize people from speaking the truth. It all comes from the American left in our
[14:59.120 --> 15:05.960]  modern political parlance. But it was info wars that was groundbreaking. It is info wars
[15:05.960 --> 15:11.620]  that's been set for destruction. You know this. Another way info wars is having a victory
[15:11.620 --> 15:18.680]  right now is Alex Jones new book has been on the top selling charts on Amazon since
[15:18.680 --> 15:26.200]  it was released for preorder just under a month ago. And we're about to launch a fundraiser
[15:26.200 --> 15:34.440]  at infowarstore.com. Alex Jones is going to be signing thousands of these books. I think
[15:34.440 --> 15:41.440]  the final number was 5000. Alex is planning on signing thousands of the great reset and
[15:41.440 --> 15:44.720]  the war for the world by Alex Jones. He's going to sign them and we're going to sell
[15:44.720 --> 15:51.520]  them at infowarstore.com. The latest fundraiser to make sure that free speech can stay alive
[15:51.520 --> 15:59.960]  and that info wars can beat the internet censorship of the totalitarian democrat left regime.
[15:59.960 --> 16:05.400]  So many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on the street and said super
[16:05.400 --> 16:11.120]  male vitality is incredible. Why does it work so well? And the answer is very simple. It

[16:23.600 --> 16:30.040]  or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects. It's cold pressed.

[19:04.920 --> 19:10.040]  a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire. Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[19:10.040 --> 19:14.840]  You see it every year. 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers. 50 different tax returns,
[19:14.840 --> 19:20.280]  50 different answers. And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms,
[19:20.280 --> 19:24.920]  and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public
[19:24.920 --> 19:29.960]  understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important situation with inflation and all
[19:29.960 --> 19:36.440]  the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do things tax wise. It's legal and lawful
[19:36.440 --> 19:39.960]  that allows you to keep more your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great
[19:39.960 --> 19:46.520]  tax advice in the last few years. The only way you fail is not writing down the URL,
[19:46.520 --> 19:56.680]  jonestaxrelief.com. One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-904-285. 833-904-285.
[20:18.280 --> 20:22.840]  All right, I've got a whole stack of news here I want to get into on the raid of Mar-a-Lago.
[20:24.040 --> 20:36.120]  Alex is going to be joining me at noon, so 40 minutes. And it's just hilarious. Democrats,
[20:36.120 --> 20:41.640]  just you are the bad guys. We know you're the bad guys. You're the communists. You're the anti-American
[20:41.640 --> 20:50.520]  degenerate culture scum rotgut of our civilization. You're destroyers is what you are. The American
[20:50.520 --> 20:58.920]  left, Democrats are the destroyers of civilization, the destroyers of world. And that's what they're
[20:58.920 --> 21:03.720]  in the process of doing right now, destroying the United States of America. And so the coping
[21:03.720 --> 21:13.160]  that they're attempting right now to deal with the American people waking up and realizing
[21:13.160 --> 21:17.400]  who the bad guys are, realizing who the Nazis are, realizing who the authoritarians are,
[21:17.400 --> 21:22.600]  the totalitarians are, realizing where the corruption runs deep. It is the Democrat party.
[21:22.600 --> 21:28.200]  It is the establishment regime that is allied, unified with the American left.
[21:28.200 --> 21:36.360]  And so here's Eric Swalwell trying to cope last night. He puts this statement out, just ridiculous.
[21:39.080 --> 21:45.400]  He says, the FBI didn't broadcast. They searched Trump's home. They didn't even send agents in FBI
[21:45.400 --> 21:51.800]  jackets. The only reason we know it happened is because Trump told us the FBI didn't try to
[21:51.800 --> 21:59.240]  embarrass Trump. The guy who politicized it should be the one who shows the warrant. Eric Swalwell.
[21:59.240 --> 22:08.200]  I mean, just what an unmitigated lying douchebag. I mean, what an absolute scum.
[22:10.040 --> 22:17.560]  What an absolute lowlife lying cockroach Eric Swalwell is, a traitor to this country,
[22:17.560 --> 22:23.080]  a traitor to the human race, a traitor to his own family, his own lineage,
[22:24.120 --> 22:31.800]  a complete disgrace to the human race. Oh, the FBI wasn't trying to embarrass Trump.
[22:32.440 --> 22:41.000]  Nobody would even knew it would have happened. Eric, they showed up with 30-plus agents with guns.
[22:41.000 --> 22:50.040]  Oh, they were, they pilfered through his wife's wardrobe. You pervert freaks.
[22:53.160 --> 22:58.200]  They are perverts, by the way. I mean, aside from what they do to children to get their sexual rocks
[22:58.200 --> 23:03.160]  off, I mean, it's like they made this whole big deal. Alex Jones had a picture of his wife on
[23:03.160 --> 23:07.000]  his phone. It's like they make this whole big fuss about a picture of his wife. They go on multiple
[23:07.000 --> 23:14.200]  news outlets talking about it. These people are perverted freaks. They are sexually perverted
[23:14.200 --> 23:20.440]  freaks. Of course, they want to sexualize children. But for Eric Swalwell to sit here and act like
[23:20.440 --> 23:28.680]  the FBI was trying to do things above board, what a joke. And they didn't give Trump's attorneys or
[23:28.680 --> 23:37.160]  Donald Trump himself the warrant. And guess what? Swalwell, the judge that signed the warrant, came
[23:37.160 --> 23:43.160]  out today and he actually demanded that the FBI give Trump's lawyers a copy. Because they didn't.
[23:43.960 --> 23:51.400]  Even the judge that signed the warrant admitted that Trump's lawyers did not get a copy of it
[23:51.400 --> 23:57.080]  and made a statement demanding that they do. Sorry, Eric, you're wrong again. But oh, I guess,
[23:57.080 --> 24:03.080]  you know, the FBI is showing up at Mar-a-Lago for 10 hours with guns drawn in trucks with dozens
[24:03.080 --> 24:07.640]  of agents. I guess that's the FBI trying to do things above board, right? Because it's not like
[24:07.640 --> 24:11.880]  they could have just asked Donald Trump for documents. It's not like they could have just
[24:11.880 --> 24:17.320]  asked Donald Trump for corruption and done things amicably. No, this is Eric Swalwell. I mean,
[24:17.320 --> 24:21.400]  look at these images of all the FBI agents out there flashing lights and everything. And Swalwell
[24:21.400 --> 24:28.200]  says they weren't trying to embarrass him. They weren't trying to do this quietly. What's Eric
[24:28.200 --> 24:39.640]  Swalwell going to lie about next? Here's the rest of the news on that. The deep state corruption
[24:39.640 --> 24:45.800]  Democrat running the FBI and all the other alphabet agencies continues to be put on display.
[24:45.800 --> 24:52.120]  The FBI delivers subpoenas to Republicans who question election theft. So you're not allowed to
[24:52.120 --> 25:02.520]  question an election unless you're a Democrat. See how that works? You're not allowed to question
[25:02.520 --> 25:06.440]  an election unless you're a Democrat. Then you're expected to question it when you lose. But if
[25:06.440 --> 25:12.200]  you're a Republican and you question an election, how dare you? The FBI is going to come out and
[25:12.200 --> 25:17.640]  come after you. Now, here's Megyn Kelly just showing you once again how despicable the media is.
[25:19.080 --> 25:24.280]  Megyn Kelly goes ballistic over FBI raid against Trump, says it's BS, says it's about January
[25:24.280 --> 25:29.960]  6th. You know, that's nice, Megyn. Megyn really thinks she knows how to go where the wind blows,
[25:29.960 --> 25:34.120]  doesn't she? When she thought it was advantageous for her career to attack Donald Trump and be
[25:34.120 --> 25:39.240]  anti-Donald Trump, she did it. Now she thinks it's advantageous to support Donald Trump. And so
[25:39.240 --> 25:45.960]  she's doing it. Just shows you how corrupt two-faced the media really is. Rand Paul suggests FBI
[25:45.960 --> 25:50.920]  may have planted evidence at Mar-a-Lago. Thank you, Rand Paul, for being willing to say it.
[25:50.920 --> 25:57.320]  Donald Trump said it as well. And they've got the whole thing on tape, by the way,
[25:58.440 --> 26:04.120]  ladies and gentlemen. And the FBI told them to turn the cameras off. They didn't.
[26:04.120 --> 26:12.280]  And so Eric Trump said that he has, or they have on camera, FBI agents behaving improperly. So I
[26:12.280 --> 26:15.960]  don't know what that means. They have the footage. The feds thought that they turned the cameras off.
[26:15.960 --> 26:22.440]  They didn't. How's that for a taste of your own medicine? Tulsi Gabbard speaks out against it.
[26:22.440 --> 26:27.720]  FBI raid against Trump, a blatant abuse of power. Thank you, Tulsi Gabbard, for telling it like it
[26:27.720 --> 26:34.520]  is. Indiana Republican who was born in the USSR blasts FBI Trump raid as KGB-style tactics. Yeah,
[26:34.520 --> 26:39.240]  it's hilarious. The American Left calls everyone Nazis. The American Left pretends like Russia is
[26:39.240 --> 26:45.240]  still the USSR, you know, tyrants. And then the American Left goes out and behaves like Nazis
[26:45.240 --> 26:51.320]  and communists from the USSR and the KGB. It's funny, they point the finger at all their enemies
[26:51.320 --> 26:57.400]  saying, Russia and Russian, Nazi, Nazi. And then you look at their playbook and it's just got nothing
[26:57.400 --> 27:04.600]  but communist Nazi playbook plays in it. It's all they do. UFC president Dana White and top
[27:04.600 --> 27:09.400]  fighters slam FBI Trump raid. Well, thank God for the UFC and Dana White because you're not going
[27:09.400 --> 27:15.160]  to find another professional athlete in this country saying a damn thing. They're all either cowards
[27:15.160 --> 27:25.240]  or morons. And you know what? I know that a lot of professional athletes tune in to this transmission
[27:25.240 --> 27:38.520]  and our broadcasts. You know, somebody's going to have to break the barrier. And Aaron Rodgers kind
[27:38.520 --> 27:42.760]  of pushed it and tested it and Kyrie Irving kind of pushed it and tested it and Jonathan Isaac and
[27:42.760 --> 27:47.560]  there have been some other players making some statements. But man, oh man, and I get it. You
[27:47.560 --> 27:53.080]  don't want to bring politics into the profession. I actually appreciate that. But in case you haven't
[27:53.080 --> 27:58.360]  realized, the politics have already been brought into your profession. They have drag queen story
[27:58.360 --> 28:05.080]  times at ball games now. So that's what's going on. But hey, the UFC isn't afraid to tell it like
[28:05.080 --> 28:13.080]  it is. The UFC isn't afraid to stand up for America. Good for them. Now I've seen this theory
[28:13.080 --> 28:24.760]  brandied about. And well, okay, the theory is that there's a rat in the Trump team or at Mar-a-Lago.
[28:24.760 --> 28:32.200]  Mar-a-Lago rat informant told FBI what documents in Trump's possession and where to search during raid.
[28:33.320 --> 28:38.040]  But you know, I'll come back to this on the other side.
[28:38.040 --> 28:48.280]  But you know, what if Trump put out bait? What if there was a supposed rat inside Mar-a-Lago,
[28:48.280 --> 28:54.440]  but it wasn't actually a rat? It was just a decoy. It was just bait. Because you know how
[28:54.440 --> 29:03.320]  easy it is to trick a Democrat rat, right? Sold out for more than a year and a half because

[30:03.080 --> 30:09.320]  of products focused on healing from the toxic world of a corrupt system, which has allowed info
[30:09.320 --> 30:16.280]  wars to remain a free public broadcast to combat the dangerous lies of the mainstream media.
[30:16.280 --> 30:26.760]  Alex Jones is patient zero for alternative facts. Do you understand what I have said?
[30:26.760 --> 30:31.880]  Yes, I believe what I said was true. So I don't. Yes, you believe everything you say is true,
[30:31.880 --> 30:38.680]  but it isn't. Your beliefs do not make something true. That is what we're doing here. There's
[30:38.680 --> 30:43.880]  going to be a large set of planets who are going to be dividing up the corpse of info wars in the
[30:43.880 --> 30:50.120]  bankruptcy of state. The info wars audience has mobilized and awakened the world to the threat
[30:50.120 --> 30:56.680]  that is globalism. And with your continued support, we will keep going. Join us now and support the
[30:56.680 --> 31:03.400]  info war. If you say Alex Jones crazy, he's a conspiracy theory guys, a nutcase. He got these
[31:03.400 --> 31:10.840]  rants and all that. What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different
[31:10.840 --> 31:19.240]  topics of signal, not noise. If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC
[31:19.240 --> 31:24.520]  and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[31:25.080 --> 31:28.760]  And if you're a set in a human being and just watching it, you say, well, God, Alex Jones
[31:28.760 --> 31:33.080]  is ahead of this. Not only that, he kind of explained it. You are one of the great thinkers
[31:33.080 --> 31:39.080]  of this. That is very rare. You got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that
[31:39.080 --> 31:42.680]  in this new book, I got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing,
[31:42.680 --> 31:47.720]  I go, this is it. This is no Beatrix. You're not going to be flipping pages or you're going to be
[31:47.720 --> 31:53.480]  having a pin out and you're going to be underlining stuff. Great reset by Alex Jones. Order your

[32:00.760 --> 32:05.560]  planet, especially as you get older, you gain weight even if you eat a lot less. I got to tell
[32:05.560 --> 32:11.160]  you, info wars is only about bringing you amazing products that really work. So we looked at the
[32:11.160 --> 32:15.720]  supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with and we said, what are the best
[32:15.720 --> 32:21.560]  selling natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out there? We went and looked
[32:21.560 --> 32:27.800]  at the top 10. They all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product. But with our
[32:27.800 --> 32:37.240]  new product from X7 diet force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences

[32:55.880 --> 32:58.600]  diet force. You need to take this product. It really works.
[33:28.520 --> 33:33.480]  So I'm seeing a narrative forming here or conflicting narratives or battling narratives,
[33:33.480 --> 33:40.440]  if you will. Is there a rat inside of Trump's people inside of Trump's team? Is there a rat at
[33:40.440 --> 33:50.280]  Mar-a-Lago? Or potentially did Donald Trump set a little trap for the FBI? Maybe not even for
[33:50.280 --> 33:57.560]  anything too consequential in its purpose, but more of just a hey look what we can get them to do
[33:59.720 --> 34:04.680]  where he just says to maybe a couple people on his team hey somebody tell the feds that I've got
[34:04.680 --> 34:09.080]  this in my safe or somebody tell the feds you heard I got this over here let's see what we can get
[34:09.080 --> 34:16.600]  them to do and then boom they jump and do it. Or maybe there was somebody inside of Mar-a-Lago
[34:16.600 --> 34:23.880]  that wanted to try to rat Trump out to the feds or maybe Trump was trying to smoke out a mole or
[34:23.880 --> 34:33.160]  a rat he had inside of his team. It's really odd because still to this day the topic is so radioactive
[34:33.160 --> 34:37.720]  nobody wants to touch it. The Republicans, Trump's 11th on a press conference. Christopher Ray had a
[34:37.720 --> 34:41.240]  press conference yesterday discussing something else. Somebody brought it up. He basically
[34:41.240 --> 34:45.560]  balked at the question. Mitch McConnell's not interested in commenting. Kevin McCarthy sends
[34:45.560 --> 34:51.800]  out a couple nice tweets that's it. So this thing is so radioactive nobody wants to touch it.
[34:54.040 --> 35:00.200]  And the fact that the feds don't even want to make a statement makes me think maybe there is
[35:00.200 --> 35:07.480]  something there that they got set up. Maybe there is something there that they fell into a trap
[35:07.480 --> 35:12.280]  and that they've been severely embarrassed here because how can they not have a press conference
[35:12.280 --> 35:17.880]  on this? I mean this is one of the biggest things. And we all know that their goal is to destroy Trump
[35:17.880 --> 35:22.200]  so why wouldn't they be wanting to brag about what they've done and to demonize Trump further with
[35:22.200 --> 35:28.520]  the activities unless it was a total bust for them. Unless it was a total swing and a miss for them.
[35:31.800 --> 35:38.280]  And we're learning more about what they took. A cocktail napkin, a birthday menu, some letters,
[35:38.280 --> 35:43.640]  some memos, some maps, but really nothing consequential. Nothing that they claim they were
[35:43.640 --> 35:51.240]  looking for like classified records. So again where they set up was Trump smoking out a rat.
[35:51.240 --> 35:56.360]  Was there a rat that thought he had something but it wasn't there? Why is nobody commenting right now?
[35:56.360 --> 36:09.640]  But see we can't trust the FBI. We can't trust the FBI at all. At all. And any FBI agent that
[36:09.640 --> 36:19.400]  it isn't totally corrupt needs to be leaving the Bureau or turning into a whistleblower like dozens
[36:19.400 --> 36:30.040]  have. But so even though Chris Ray didn't want to talk about the raid at Mar-a-Lago yesterday
[36:30.040 --> 36:41.720]  when he did a brief press conference at the Omaha offices of the FBI, he did victimize himself.
[36:41.720 --> 36:47.640]  He did turn the FBI into a victim. FBI Director Chris Ray won't discuss raid on Trump's Florida
[36:47.640 --> 36:53.880]  residents but says he is concerned about threats against agents. Oh, so the FBI can threaten the
[36:53.880 --> 37:01.480]  American people all day long, but the poor, poor FBI is the victim. Ah, the poor FBI is the victim,
[37:01.480 --> 37:07.960]  yes. Of course they are. But then what happens today? Story developing right now.
[37:07.960 --> 37:18.600]  At the FBI office in Cincinnati, someone apparently fired shots and tried to break into the Bureau.
[37:18.600 --> 37:23.160]  So, oh, what do you know? Christopher Ray doesn't want to talk about the raid, but he does say I'm
[37:23.160 --> 37:27.160]  worried about threats to the FBI is what I'm worried about. I'm worried about the FBI. We're the
[37:27.160 --> 37:33.400]  heroes here and the victims. And then 12 hours later, someone in goes and tries to shoot up the
[37:33.400 --> 37:39.400]  Cincinnati FBI building. Now, it's initial reports that nobody's been shot. I don't think anybody's
[37:39.400 --> 37:46.680]  been killed or anything like that. But, oh, it's the FBI. They can spy on us. They can lie to us.
[37:46.680 --> 37:53.880]  They can set us up. They can frame us. They can raid a former president's home in a political
[37:54.680 --> 37:59.640]  persecution attack, but they're the victims. And then the next day, oh, look, we got a shooter at
[37:59.640 --> 38:09.320]  the FBI in Cincinnati. Now, see, this is a very delicate balancing act that we're in right now.
[38:11.400 --> 38:20.840]  Because really the standard I think in human history has actually changed. We are in some ways,
[38:20.840 --> 38:30.440]  or we like to believe at least, that we as humanity are more civilized now than we've ever been before.
[38:30.440 --> 38:36.760]  And I think you could make arguments either way. But as far as being domesticated and really having
[38:37.960 --> 38:43.240]  certain primal survival instincts just beaten out of us and chemically castrated out of us,
[38:43.240 --> 38:49.080]  we're more civilized or rather domesticated in that regard. So why am I saying this? Well,
[38:50.680 --> 38:56.600]  you don't have to go back too long in human history where if you had a free people or a republic
[38:57.320 --> 39:04.680]  like you have here in America and you just had an abusive, authoritarian, tyrannical regime that
[39:04.680 --> 39:10.120]  was persecuting people, imprisoning people, destroying their lives, killing people. I mean,
[39:10.120 --> 39:17.720]  you'd probably already be seeing violence consistently and groups forming and skirmishes
[39:17.720 --> 39:22.040]  and a lot of bloodshed in the streets. And we're not getting that. And I'm glad because we don't
[39:22.040 --> 39:26.760]  support that because I do want to think that we're more civilized. I do want to think that we've
[39:26.760 --> 39:36.040]  advanced as a species. Not that being domesticated isn't advancement or revolution, but that transcending
[39:36.040 --> 39:43.560]  the need or the urge to engage in violence to accomplish a means to an end.
[39:46.360 --> 39:51.080]  But so is the FBI
[39:54.520 --> 39:58.840]  a terrorist organization? Is the FBI an anti-American organization?
[39:58.840 --> 40:07.880]  Is the FBI a criminal operation? Yes, yes, and yes. Abso-fricking-lutely. Now, does that mean
[40:07.880 --> 40:14.680]  the average FBI agent needs to be under gunfire from civilians? Absolutely not. But see, I'm not
[40:14.680 --> 40:23.880]  going to sit here and let the FBI turn itself into the victim. Hell no. The FBI is the bad guy.
[40:23.880 --> 40:32.920]  The FBI are the criminals. So that's why, and I'm glad for the most part I've seen it, not everywhere,
[40:32.920 --> 40:39.000]  actually, some conservatives, some right-wing commentators, I won't say are advocating for violence,
[40:39.000 --> 40:45.320]  but they're echoing the hymns of Andrew Breitbart, the late great Andrew Breitbart,
[40:45.320 --> 40:50.600]  hey, you want to try to destroy our lives? You want to come after our families? You want to come
[40:50.600 --> 41:01.000]  after our fortunes? You want to come after our freedom? War. But see, you started the war,
[41:01.640 --> 41:08.680]  didn't you? You started the war when you started politically persecuting people.
[41:10.040 --> 41:13.960]  You started the war when you started politically imprisoning people. You started the war when
[41:13.960 --> 41:18.360]  you tried to false flag your political opposition like Jesse Smallette or like the kidnapping
[41:18.360 --> 41:25.480]  of Gretchen Whitmer. You are committing acts of war, not Trump supporters, not conservatives,
[41:25.480 --> 41:31.400]  not Republicans, Democrats, liberals, leftists, progressives. You are the violent agitators,
[41:31.400 --> 41:36.120]  you are the violent actors, you are the ones trying to start a war, and you're the ones trying to
[41:36.120 --> 41:40.200]  cry a victim. So that's why we have to be smart and patient here, and it's not going to be good,
[41:40.200 --> 41:43.720]  folks. Democrats, liberals, leftists, the regime, the establishment, the government,
[41:43.720 --> 41:48.760]  they're going to kill people, they're going to imprison people, it's going to get real bad. But
[41:48.760 --> 41:54.040]  I believe our path to victory is to sit back, let them do this, let them exhaust themselves,
[41:54.040 --> 41:59.160]  let them show them, show the world that they're the evil people so that when the time comes,
[42:00.040 --> 42:05.400]  we can politically, peacefully, legally, lawfully remove them from power and imprison
[42:05.400 --> 42:11.880]  the criminals that belong in prison. So armed gunmen tries to break into the bureau at FBI
[42:11.880 --> 42:18.920]  in Cincinnati, and they'll certainly use this to demonize Trump supporters, they'll certainly
[42:18.920 --> 42:25.160]  use this to demonize conservatives, they'll certainly use this to turn the FBI into the
[42:25.160 --> 42:29.320]  victim here as they're engaged in more criminal activity, terrorist activity than they've ever
[42:29.320 --> 42:33.160]  been involved in in modern American history, and now they're trying to be the victims.
[42:34.440 --> 42:39.720]  Would you, would you put it past the FBI? I mean, who knows what they've got out there with MK
[42:39.720 --> 42:43.160]  all truck going on? Maybe they've got people brainwashed, but would you put it
[42:44.360 --> 42:51.160]  past the FBI or this regime to send some stooge to the FBI office with a gun to try to victimize
[42:51.160 --> 43:21.000]  the FBI as its approval rating goes into the negatives? I wouldn't.
[43:21.640 --> 43:27.400]  So they're not boiling or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects.
[43:27.400 --> 43:34.040]  It's cold pressed. It's been sold out for eight months or more. It's finally back in stock at

[44:18.120 --> 44:22.520]  especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't
[44:22.520 --> 44:27.400]  want the general public understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important situation

[45:59.960 --> 46:04.920]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want you to read
[46:04.920 --> 46:10.520]  that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life, the big tech companies,
[46:10.520 --> 46:15.480]  they don't want you to read this book. They want to control what you think, what you do,
[46:15.480 --> 46:20.680]  what you read, but you don't want that. And Alex Jones doesn't want that. And this book shows you
[46:20.680 --> 46:26.120]  what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it. And so by buying
[46:26.120 --> 46:31.720]  this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work, that freedom is alive in this country.
[46:31.720 --> 46:37.800]  This is a central reading. And you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks
[46:37.800 --> 46:42.840]  in. It's not going to be available in bookstores. It's not going to be available in libraries.
[46:42.840 --> 46:47.000]  They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're not going
[46:47.000 --> 46:52.440]  to be able to do it. Prove that censorship doesn't work. Buy the great reset. Thank you, Alex Jones.
[46:52.440 --> 47:02.440]  I really appreciate you having me on. And I appreciate you writing this book and getting the information out there.
[47:41.320 --> 47:46.440]  It's really a work of art. I mean, I give them credit, actually. I'm stunned. I'm in awe.
[47:46.440 --> 47:53.160]  I'm in awe of it. Eric Swalwell claiming he's the victim. He's publishing death threat voicemails.
[47:53.160 --> 47:58.120]  He claims that he's getting, again, I don't trust Eric Swalwell. He's a known liar.
[47:58.840 --> 48:04.040]  I bet that Eric Swalwell is faking it, just like Jesse Smallette fakes a hate crime,
[48:04.040 --> 48:10.600]  just like the FBI fakes a kidnapping of a governor, just like Democrats lie and fake everything.
[48:10.600 --> 48:16.360]  Oh, how convenient now. Democrats publish voicemails they get of death threats. Oh,
[48:16.360 --> 48:21.320]  how convenient now. The FBI has a gunman show up at their Cincinnati office. Oh, yes.
[48:22.760 --> 48:25.320]  But see, here's the thing.
[48:28.840 --> 48:34.200]  There is karma in the universe, and there are consequences for actions, but
[48:34.200 --> 48:41.320]  you know, there's going to be people
[48:43.320 --> 48:47.720]  that are going to see those voicemails of death threats to Swalwell, whether they're real or not,
[48:48.840 --> 48:53.800]  or see gunmen going into the FBI, whether it's legitimate or not. And they're going to say good.
[48:54.600 --> 48:58.280]  They're going to say good. This is what the Democrats deserve. This is what the feds deserve.
[48:58.280 --> 49:03.000]  Now, you're not going to get that messaging here. We're not violent revolutionaries,
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.800]  never have been, never are going to be. I'm not going to fall into that trap because I believe
[49:08.600 --> 49:15.080]  similar to January 6th, the raid or an angle to it is they want to trap conservatives and
[49:15.080 --> 49:20.520]  Republicans and Trump supporters into violence so that they can further politically persecute them
[49:20.520 --> 49:27.160]  and imprison them. I've learned that lesson. I got set up on January 6th. I didn't even do anything,
[49:27.160 --> 49:30.040]  and they're still persecuting me over it, and I've been imprisoned over it,
[49:30.040 --> 49:37.640]  destroying my life over it. So I've already fallen into the trap without even stepping foot in the
[49:37.640 --> 49:44.280]  trap. I didn't even step foot in the trap. I just happened to be there when the trap was there set,
[49:44.280 --> 49:48.920]  catching people. And so they just said, well, we're just going to get you to. So I've already
[49:48.920 --> 49:53.480]  been caught in the trap that I didn't even step in. So I recognize that I see it. I'm not going to
[49:53.480 --> 49:58.600]  fall into it again. The Democrats want us to call for violence. The Democrats want us to engage in
[49:58.600 --> 50:03.560]  violence so that they can send the corrupt Gestapo federal government after us to continue the
[50:03.560 --> 50:06.840]  persecution of Trump supporters. So I'm not going to fall into that trap.
[50:10.360 --> 50:19.000]  But I will say there's a there's a weird aspect to this where it's almost like
[50:21.880 --> 50:26.120]  I don't even know how to describe it. It's almost like if they did come in here and shut
[50:26.120 --> 50:31.960]  infowars down tomorrow, even though it would be an awful thing for America, it'd be a horrible
[50:31.960 --> 50:37.080]  thing for free speech, it'd be a horrible thing for the crew members here. It's almost like
[50:39.640 --> 50:44.360]  now is the time that they would do it. In a way, it'd be like the greatest thing they could ever do.
[50:46.120 --> 50:52.280]  Because it's like this whole thing is such a minefield right now. And we've already had so
[50:52.280 --> 50:59.160]  many limbs and arms and we've been so battled scarred and wounded. I mean, folks, that's why
[50:59.160 --> 51:04.200]  you hear Alex so many times talking about it'd be a relief to shut it down kind of sarcastically
[51:04.200 --> 51:09.960]  tongue in cheek saying because we've entered the paradigm now where it's it's it's not infowars
[51:09.960 --> 51:14.680]  next year's news today. It's now everyone's info wars. Now everybody sees what's going on.
[51:14.680 --> 51:21.160]  And when we've been through it so much that we're not going to fall into their traps.
[51:21.160 --> 51:28.360]  But at the same time, there is going to be organic anger. There is going to be organic
[51:29.080 --> 51:36.200]  frustration and resentment and hatred, quite frankly, to the Democrat Party and to the federal
[51:36.200 --> 51:45.560]  government, which they deserve. They absolutely deserve. But I don't want to fall into the trap
[51:45.560 --> 51:51.640]  that they're setting for us like January 6. I want to stay the course. I want to continue to
[51:51.640 --> 51:57.320]  awaken hearts and minds. And I want to continue to influence and inspire other people to do the
[51:57.320 --> 52:04.600]  same and run for office and vote and organize and activate so that we can peacefully politically
[52:04.600 --> 52:09.480]  take our country back and restore it as the constitutional republic that it is.
[52:10.680 --> 52:14.200]  That's our goal. That's our path. I want to stick to it and not be distracted.
[52:16.120 --> 52:22.680]  But just know the feds are going to set up false flags. Absolutely. The Democrats are
[52:22.680 --> 52:29.320]  going to set up false flags. Absolutely. And they are looking to 100% in trap conservatives,
[52:29.320 --> 52:35.000]  in trap Republicans, and in trap Trump supporters into violence. Absolutely. That's what they're
[52:35.000 --> 52:40.360]  trying to do. That's why Swalwell's sharing his voicemails. That's why the feds are talking about
[52:40.360 --> 52:47.560]  the gunmen going into the Cincinnati FBI office. I would say that it's fake, personally. But I
[52:47.560 --> 52:52.120]  don't know that. It could organically be a gunman going into the FBI office that's sick and tired
[52:52.120 --> 52:56.440]  of the FBI corruption. It could organically be an American citizen calling up Eric Swalwell,
[52:56.440 --> 53:07.000]  calling him a effing piece of s, because he is. But we cannot fall into their trap, ladies and
[53:07.000 --> 53:15.640]  gentlemen. We cannot give them what they want. So we have to stay focused on the goal. Stay
[53:15.640 --> 53:20.440]  focused in the right mindset. Know what they're trying to do to us. Understand the trap they're
[53:20.440 --> 53:25.160]  trying to set. Know they're going to stage false flags. Know they're going to try to bait us into
[53:25.160 --> 53:32.360]  violence. We cannot do it even if you believe it's justified. And I understand where you're
[53:32.360 --> 53:39.640]  coming from. Even if you believe that it's still a trap. It's still a trap.
[53:43.720 --> 53:50.280]  Now, meanwhile, and this is this is what's really so frustrating about it, too. American
[53:50.280 --> 53:58.920]  cities are dying. They are dying. They are just bleeding out. And our leadership doesn't give a
[53:58.920 --> 54:05.640]  damn because they're too busy going after Trump and his voters. So Trump pleads the fifth in
[54:05.640 --> 54:10.360]  questioning from the New York Attorney General, Leticia James. It's obviously all political
[54:10.360 --> 54:14.680]  persecution. There's nothing there. They can't even get prosecutors to take up the case, folks.
[54:14.680 --> 54:19.080]  They can't even get liberal prosecutors in New York to take up the case because there is no case.
[54:19.080 --> 54:24.280]  I mean, there's not even a breadcrumb for them to satisfy their hunger.
[54:26.760 --> 54:29.800]  So American cities are dying.
[54:31.800 --> 54:37.000]  And then you've got Democrat bastards like Ed Markey, who goes in front of cameras this morning
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.920]  and says, if you can't afford gas, buy an electric car. They can't afford an electric
[54:42.920 --> 54:51.240]  car, you a-hole. They live paycheck to paycheck. They can barely afford a tank of gas and you're
[54:51.240 --> 54:58.040]  telling them to go out and buy a new car, you dickhead. See, and that's organic anger that I
[54:58.040 --> 55:05.240]  have right now because I don't like seeing American cities pummeled into poverty and pummeled into
[55:05.240 --> 55:12.040]  desolation and pummeled into violent crime because of Democrat party policy and a world
[55:12.040 --> 55:19.560]  economic forum agenda. That angers me. That ticks me off. That breaks my heart. And then I have to
[55:19.560 --> 55:25.240]  look at these bastards like Eric Swalwell and Ed Markey puff up their chest like they're the victims
[55:25.240 --> 55:29.320]  and puff up their chest like they want to help this country as they're stabbing us in the back
[55:29.320 --> 55:37.160]  every chance they get. And then every city Democrats runs turn into a hellhole. Every American
[55:37.160 --> 55:43.000]  city run by Democrats turns into an absolute hellhole and they're still going to tell you,
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  we're going to get Trump. We're going to get those Trump supporters. Meanwhile, you look at the
[55:47.000 --> 55:56.120]  cities they run, they are falling apart. But hey, guys, as Trump is being politically persecuted,
[55:56.120 --> 55:59.800]  as you're being politically persecuted, as Democrats are rounding up political prisoners
[55:59.800 --> 56:06.120]  and murdering people, Joe and Hunter Biden are flying off to another vacation. So Joe Biden
[56:06.120 --> 56:11.400]  takes 20 days off a month. Joe Biden goes on vacation to his beachfront mansion every weekend.
[56:12.280 --> 56:17.800]  And now after taking 20 days off last month, he hops on an airplane with the entire family on
[56:17.800 --> 56:23.800]  Air Force One to go on vacation with Hunter Biden. Now, is Hunter Biden's child going to go that he
[56:23.800 --> 56:29.960]  had with the stripper? No. He doesn't make child payments to that mother that he abandoned and
[56:29.960 --> 56:35.320]  that child that he abandoned. They don't get invited to the family events. And also, it turns
[56:35.320 --> 56:43.720]  out when Nancy Pelosi went to Taiwan to inflate her own ego in her final run as a congresswoman,
[56:43.720 --> 56:48.440]  she took her son there too, you know, to engage in a little insider trading, make sure they know
[56:48.440 --> 56:52.200]  that their stocks purchases are going well. They want to know what's really going on with China and
[56:52.760 --> 56:56.520]  the microchip companies. So she flew her son over there with her too. And she just says,
[56:56.520 --> 57:01.560]  oh, he was just my escort. These people are so corrupt. It's unbelievable. But folks,
[57:01.560 --> 57:06.520]  we just got to pray. We got to stay focused on the agenda. Stay focused on the mission. Do not
[57:06.520 --> 57:11.320]  let them distract us. Do not let them bait us into violence. Do not let them false flag us into
[57:11.320 --> 57:19.320]  submission. That's what they're in the process of doing right now. So Alex Jones coming up in the

[59:53.400 --> 59:56.600]  of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[59:56.600 --> 1:00:09.640]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[1:00:14.360 --> 1:00:18.040]  Alex Jones, the four rank conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[1:00:18.040 --> 1:00:26.040]  Alex Jones.
[1:00:26.040 --> 1:00:35.560]  Stop Russian. Stop wars comes to mind.
[1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:45.640]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed. I hope.
[1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:58.200]  Alex Jones owes $50 million all for his lies about Sandy Hook. And while we've been reporting
[1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:02.440]  that story from its inception tonight, we dig into how this is actually a larger warning
[1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:07.880]  for other liars and conspiracy theorists in our society and our politics. It's a rebuke
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:12.760]  and a punishment that we believe, according to a lot of legal experts, will set this new precedent.
[1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:18.760]  But jury in the Alex Jones trial ordering the conspiracy theorists to pay $45.2 million.
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:25.560]  Tonight, a Texas jury punishing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for his lies,
[1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:32.840]  ordering him to pay $45.2 million. Jones is basically paying the penalty. Being held
[1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:37.720]  financially liable for the lies about that massacre, which go along with a whole wider
[1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:47.880]  profit approach to lies. I ask that with your verdict, you not only take Alex Jones' platform
[1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:56.360]  that he talks about away, I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform. Take him
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:12.440]  out. He is patient, zero for alternative facts. Now, what does this mean? An illegal limits and punishment for other individuals who make lying and conspiracy theories part of their business model or politics.
[1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:18.200]  We've seen this all the way up to the insurrection as a huge part of American life. Well, Fox News is clearly watching this closely.
[1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:24.520]  They are facing this suit by Dominion Voting Systems for over a billion dollars about false
[1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:30.040]  perceptions and what they say is deliberate lying that could basically bankrupt that whole company,
[1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:37.240]  given Fox's huge megaphone. We're talking about the reckless promotion of lies with Malice,
[1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:41.480]  and that's what Jones does, the cases prove this. It's been proven over and over again,
[1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:46.360]  not just from Sandy Hook with 9-11, truth or truth or wisdom and everything else.
[1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:52.840]  And so I think if you're in that line of work, you have to watch your back now because this
[1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:58.520]  jury has sent a signal that we're not going to allow First Amendment rights to protect
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:04.600]  the promotion of reckless disinformation and propaganda. He lied to make his money,
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:13.480]  and he's lying to keep his money. Right now we see Dominion not just suing Fox,
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:19.400]  Dominion Voting is suing OAN, it's suing Newsmax, it's suing Rudy Giuliani,
[1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:23.960]  it's suing the pillow guy, it's suing Sidney Powell. You'd have to be really worried because
[1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:28.040]  they were, as essence, doing the same thing. Back now with some breaking news involving
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:33.960]  Fox News and a billion and a half dollar lawsuit. Dominion Voting Systems is suing Fox News for
[1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:41.320]  $1.6 billion over the new agency's claims. It rigged the 2020 election. The defamation lawsuit
[1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:46.920]  accuses Fox News of fabricating the story in an attempt to boost ratings. It is the latest win
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:52.920]  for defamation lawsuits against MAGA media's role in pushing conspiracy theories. That same judge
[1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:57.800]  appealed Dominion's lawsuit against Newsmax last week. I think there's even a bigger issue here
[1:03:57.800 --> 1:04:04.520]  than you raised in the introduction, and that is we've seen conspiracism take deep root within the
[1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:09.880]  Republican Party and the conservative movement over the last 5, 10, 15 years. Alex Jones helped
[1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:14.520]  put it there. He wasn't the only one who did this. Trump did it with brough tourism, so the whole
[1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:20.280]  conspiracy theory industry has sort of subsumed the Republican Party and the conservative movement,
[1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:24.120]  and now we're seeing out of this one jury in Austin, Texas, that they're saying,
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:29.080]  hey, we're going to try to put some guardrails up and put some brakes on this, and I think that has
[1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:35.800]  ramifications for a lot of people other than Alex Jones. As for those text messages, Rolling
[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:41.720]  Stone reports, the January 6th committee is now planning to subpoena them as it looks into Jones'
[1:04:41.720 --> 1:04:47.000]  role in the Capitol attack.
[1:04:58.760 --> 1:05:03.880]  So many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on the street and said,
[1:05:03.880 --> 1:05:09.880]  super male vitality is incredible. Why does it work so well? And the answer is very simple.
[1:05:09.880 --> 1:05:15.720]  It takes from Chinese medicine and other ancient traditions, known herbal compounds that boost
[1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:23.000]  libido, stamina, and energy, and it comes from cold pressed herbs, so they're not boiling or
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:28.760]  heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects. It's cold pressed.
[1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:34.840]  It's been sold out for eight months or more. It's finally back in stock at infowarstore.com
[1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:42.280]  for 25% off, super male vitality. And it goes great with X2, which is also 25% off,
[1:05:42.280 --> 1:05:48.520]  but if you get both these products together, they're 40% off in a combo at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:48.520 --> 1:05:56.680]  So X2 and super male vitality, 40% off together or 25% off individually at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:56.680 --> 1:06:11.000]  It's amazing. Try it today.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:18.360]  We're now into the second hour of the Alex Jones show. And Alex, I got to say, I am,
[1:06:18.360 --> 1:06:23.800]  I'm extremely proud of us right now. I'm extremely proud of you. I'm extremely proud of this crew
[1:06:23.800 --> 1:06:32.360]  because we learned the mistake from January 6 not to fall into the deep state trap of violence
[1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:37.240]  when they try to provoke us. And so after the raid at Mar-a-Lago, we've been voices of reason,
[1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:43.000]  voices of peace. And now today, you have all the Democrats and all the left wing media saying,
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:48.280]  Republicans want violence. We need new January 6 committees. We need new subpoenas of all Trump
[1:06:48.280 --> 1:06:53.800]  supporters. We beat them to it, Alex. We came on in and we immediately said, we cannot fall
[1:06:53.800 --> 1:06:58.120]  into their traps. We cannot call for violence. We need to stay peaceful, stay political,
[1:06:58.120 --> 1:07:04.680]  stay on message, stay on point. And so now all of this puffing up of their chest claiming Republicans
[1:07:04.680 --> 1:07:09.240]  want violence is going to fall on deaf ears because we didn't fall for their trap this time, Alex.
[1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:15.160]  Well, that's exactly the reason I'm here with you today. I'm taking care of some family issues.
[1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:19.800]  I'll be back with you. And I saw the special guest those tomorrow that I'll be hosting Sunday
[1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:26.280]  at 4 to 6 p.m. live and Monday as well. But you're here today doing a fantastic job. As you know,
[1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:30.120]  Mike Adams is coming up with some huge breaking news, but I had not talked to you
[1:07:31.240 --> 1:07:36.440]  today while I was traveling to visit some family that I needed to see. And I was planning to come on
[1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:40.440]  just reading the news and say, look, they're trying to provoke us into a physical war.
[1:07:40.440 --> 1:07:45.160]  That's clearly their plan. We need to stop it. As we said on Monday, as we said on Tuesday,
[1:07:45.160 --> 1:07:52.120]  as we said on Wednesday, and so exactly what we said on that Monday night emergency broadcast,
[1:07:52.120 --> 1:07:55.160]  it's an hour and 18 minutes long, would be that they would try to
[1:07:56.600 --> 1:08:01.800]  go to us into violence or claim we're going to engage in violence. And then they stage the
[1:08:01.800 --> 1:08:07.400]  false flag or they provocateur something. So you are dead on and we are tomorrow's news today.
[1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:12.360]  Yet again, we don't say that to brag. Once you know the enemy mindset, once you know how they
[1:08:12.360 --> 1:08:16.920]  operate, very, very easy to beat them. Once you understand they only have a few plays that they
[1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:23.160]  run. And so here we are on the precipice with 89 days out from the midterms of the whole world,
[1:08:23.160 --> 1:08:27.720]  not just Americans are waking up to the new world order. And we've got to be asking ourselves,
[1:08:27.720 --> 1:08:31.800]  what are they going to pull next? They're obviously trying to provocateur something violent
[1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:37.640]  against the FBI or against the Justice Department. They're trying to post their Jan 6 narrative,
[1:08:37.640 --> 1:08:43.960]  but polls show 90% of Americans think the Jan 6 death committee is a fraud. And so
[1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:49.800]  it's just not working. The larger question is with 89 days out from the midterms,
[1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:55.640]  what are they going to pull next? That's why I've said, I believe the deep state may kill Biden,
[1:08:55.640 --> 1:09:01.480]  which we're totally against happening, as a pretext to really try to trigger a civil war.
[1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:08.200]  And or Trump. So they might actually kill both of them. And you even have Bernard Currant saying
[1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:12.120]  that for our police commissioner. I mean, we're very respected, very serious man.
[1:09:12.120 --> 1:09:16.920]  See, man, I agree with me. A few days ago on the show on Tuesday, that's a major,
[1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:23.160]  major threat that we're facing. And so this is a big, big deal. So I have a clip ready from
[1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:28.040]  Biden on the show a few days ago, where he talks about this threat. And also the Bernard Currant
[1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:33.720]  clip to understand just how desperate deep state is and what the few plays they have left in their
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:45.960]  hand of cards. Here's that clip. I do not think it's beyond this administrative state and their
[1:09:45.960 --> 1:09:52.600]  deep state apparatus to actually try to work on the assassination of President Trump. I think
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:56.520]  everything's on the table. I think his security ought to be at the highest it's ever been. And
[1:09:56.520 --> 1:10:02.120]  honestly, I think he ought to, and I think he should have flown down in Mar-a-Lago this morning,
[1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:06.040]  walked out there at noon today and said, hey, I'm burning for President of the United States.
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:11.800]  Suck on that. If you remember back in 2016, when I went right before he got elected,
[1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:16.440]  I was in Washington, D.C. I was at a couple of different social events and I heard people talking.
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:23.800]  They said the Democrats want this guy so bad that they wouldn't put assassination behind it.
[1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:30.360]  And I'm going to tell you something. They've tried impeachment. They've tried another impeachment.
[1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:37.400]  They've tried one investigation after another. This is about one thing. This is about stopping
[1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:44.600]  him from running in 2024. And I'm going to tell you something. I'm not into conspiracies. I'm not
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:52.920]  into anti-government rhetoric. This is the first time in my lifetime that I would say I am deathly
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:59.160]  afraid for Donald Trump. I would not put assassination behind these people.
[1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:06.600]  All right. So, Owen, we're not tuning our horn here. We're not that smart. We know the enemy
[1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:10.280]  blueprint. We're trying to get everybody else to realize we have the enemy blueprint so they can
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:14.120]  learn about it and we can stop it together. I've been saying for the last, as you know,
[1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:19.800]  six months that they're going to assassinate Biden at each day. They're going to try to
[1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:25.160]  assassinate Trump. And now they're saying, oh, the Iranians are around Mar-Lago. They're planning
[1:11:25.160 --> 1:11:29.880]  to kill him. Yeah, right. Oh, the Russians are going to kill him. All this other garbage,
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:35.960]  because they think if they kill Trump, they can get the American people to rise up and be violent,
[1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:40.760]  which is the last thing we want. If they kill Trump, like they killed Martin Luther King
[1:11:41.720 --> 1:11:47.160]  or Malcolm X, and yes, I'm comparing them to those people, if they definitely are rebel,
[1:11:47.160 --> 1:11:51.480]  if they do that, we do not need to riot. We do not need to kill people. We do not need to attack
[1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:56.680]  FBI buildings. We need to expose them. The deep state did it. They'll probably have some crazy
[1:11:56.680 --> 1:12:02.360]  left-winger do it or some disaffected right-winger do it and blame the people. Same thing with
[1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:07.240]  Biden. The white supremacist or some loon do it. They just killed Abe because it turns out he's a
[1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:13.720]  Christian closet right-winger. That's how all the Japanese news, the Japanese cabinet just resigned
[1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:20.680]  because they're really Zen Buddhist on average. It's pretty freaky for them to learn that their
[1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:27.880]  prime minister, the Japanese president, was a closet right-wing Christian, which we can all
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:31.640]  look at and tell what's going on. They just purged the government because they're right-wing
[1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:36.840]  Christians and thought out they are. That's what's happening is there's our conspiracy of right-wing
[1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:43.080]  Christians, the one of human future in God, and there's a satanic conspiracy. This highly trained
[1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:49.000]  individual with this hand-made, incredibly well-made, so they couldn't trace it back to him, gave it to
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:57.160]  him, 12-gauge shotgun, two direct hits on a 10-inch shotgun. Those who don't know, the 10-inch shotgun
[1:12:57.160 --> 1:13:04.280]  at over 40 feet, more than 40 feet, is just an incredible shot. That was an assassination
[1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:11.480]  of a pro-America leader. China is definitely involved. It's the same thing happening here in
[1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:16.040]  America. I believe, and I know from all their pre-programming and the national securities
[1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:22.120]  that they've set up, they want to kick off a left-wing right-wing civil war. The left-wing
[1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:27.320]  will lose. The right-wing will lose. The Bilderberg Group, the Davos Group, the stabilizers
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:37.480]  will win. Now, my predictions, six months ago, of the assassination plan on Trump and Biden
[1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:41.400]  is starting to crystallize, because if you look at the enemy battle plan, that's one of the main
[1:13:41.400 --> 1:13:48.680]  cards they could pull. Mass shootings, the paper-bottom curer stage, ass bombings, power outages,
[1:13:48.680 --> 1:13:54.520]  claiming the Russians hacked the power grid. All this is pre-programmed. We're being told it's imminent,
[1:13:54.520 --> 1:13:59.560]  and it's about to happen, because the Jeffrey Epstein, Mossad, British intelligence,
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:04.920]  globalist combine that's above the countries, it's like specter. The heads of our intelligence
[1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:08.920]  agencies are specter, and then the agencies don't know they work for specter, but the new
[1:14:08.920 --> 1:14:13.480]  old order in Klaus Schwab is specter, literally. That's why Ian Fleming wrote those books,
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:20.040]  he was number two at OSS and MI6, explaining how this really worked. And so specter's real.
[1:14:20.680 --> 1:14:25.320]  Hydra's real. Sexual symbol is a hydra. That's why in James Bond, it's a hydra. They're fighting,
[1:14:25.880 --> 1:14:30.600]  and they're making their move right now, but they're exposed, and they're extremely desperate.
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:35.800]  That's why media matters, and the New York Times, the Washington Post are all panicking, that the
[1:14:35.800 --> 1:14:40.520]  entirety, basically, of right-wing leadership and real patriots have signaled to America,
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:46.120]  their pro-America, anti-centorship by coming out and endorsing info wars in just the last
[1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:51.560]  few weeks with this show trial, because they know they're next. So it is now officially recognized
[1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:56.600]  that info wars is the narrative of America and populism, countering the globalists. And I don't
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:15:01.560]  get the credit for that. The crew and the audience of activists supporting us and God gets the credit.
[1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:06.440]  I'm incredibly humbled and blown away being in this position. They see us as the top general,
[1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:10.840]  our operation. They see us as the quarterback, and it's a great responsibility. That's why I need
[1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:15.480]  your prayers to stand up for us. I need your prayers to spiritually give us discernment and
[1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:21.240]  back us, because we've been given an incredible task here and incredible weight. But I take it on
[1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:25.800]  willingly, but I want to just thank the audience of activists for this, because now America and
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:29.560]  the world is not being caught flat footed by the new old order. We are in a fighting position,
[1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:32.440]  politically, spiritually, culturally, to understand what's happening. But
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:38.040]  discretion will be the greater part of valor and not getting tricked into a violent civil war,
[1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:43.880]  which is what they want. If that happens, we'll win that too. But the point is, that's not my job.
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:48.600]  I leave the awakening, not any type of military operation. I'm not involved in that because
[1:15:48.600 --> 1:15:53.640]  those can go so wrong. But culturally, we're winning. And that's why they want to overturn
[1:15:53.640 --> 1:16:02.520]  the chessboard with violence. So many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on the
[1:16:02.520 --> 1:16:08.840]  street and said, Super male vitality is incredible. Why does it work so well? And the answer is very
[1:16:08.840 --> 1:16:15.320]  simple. It takes from Chinese medicine and other ancient traditions, known herbal compounds that
[1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:22.280]  boost libido, stamina and energy. And it comes from cold pressed herbs. So they're not boiling
[1:16:22.280 --> 1:16:28.760]  or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects. It's cold pressed. It's
[1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:35.720]  been sold out for eight months or more. It's finally back in stock at infowarstore.com for 25%

[1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:05.240]  Alex Jones expanded his broadcast by selling a line of products focused on healing from the toxic
[1:17:05.240 --> 1:17:11.720]  world of a corrupt system, which has allowed info wars to remain a free public broadcast
[1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:21.400]  to combat the dangerous lies of the mainstream media. Alex Jones is patient zero for alternative
[1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:28.840]  facts. Do you understand what I have said? Yes, I believe what I said was true. So I don't. Yes,
[1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:33.800]  you believe everything you say is true, but it isn't. Your beliefs do not make something true.
[1:17:34.440 --> 1:17:40.440]  That is, that is what we're doing here. There's going to be a large set of planets
[1:17:40.440 --> 1:17:44.120]  who are going to be dividing up the corpse of info wars in the bankruptcy estate.
[1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:50.600]  The info wars audience has mobilized and awakened the world to the threat that is globalism.
[1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:56.280]  And with your continued support, we will keep going. Join us now and support the info war.
[1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:02.920]  People say Alex Jones crazy. He's a conspiracy theory guys, a nutcase. He got these rants and
[1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:11.560]  all that. What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal,
[1:18:11.560 --> 1:18:19.000]  not noise. If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:24.760]  Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there. And if you're
[1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:28.280]  a sent in a human being and just watching it, you say, well, God, Alex Jones is ahead of this.
[1:18:28.280 --> 1:18:33.640]  Not only that, he kind of explained it. You are one of the great thinkers of this. That is very
[1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:38.440]  rare. You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that in this
[1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:42.280]  new book. I got to tell you when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing. I go,

[1:19:59.480 --> 1:20:05.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:17.320]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back here on the Alex Jones show. Alex Jones with us from
[1:20:17.320 --> 1:20:23.080]  the road, Owen Troyer in studio. It's an honor and a privilege to be with you here today. There are
[1:20:23.080 --> 1:20:31.560]  three things happening right now that I believe Alex are in indicator as to where we're going next.
[1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:38.440]  One, you have the New York Times with the top promoted live stream on Twitter right now with
[1:20:38.440 --> 1:20:44.760]  the headline, Alex Jones isn't alone. Why is disinformation so appealing? Well, what does
[1:20:44.760 --> 1:20:49.320]  that signify? They're coming for everyone next. They feel like they've got Alex Jones. They
[1:20:49.320 --> 1:20:53.080]  haven't. They may strike him down. They may strike info wars down. We'll just be more powerful than
[1:20:53.080 --> 1:20:58.600]  ever. But so that just tells you, okay, they feel like we've got Alex. Now we're going after the
[1:20:58.600 --> 1:21:03.320]  rest of them just like with censorship. That's happening right now. You've got Twitter that
[1:21:03.320 --> 1:21:10.040]  just released a statement saying starting today, we'll begin to enforce the civic integrity policy
[1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:14.760]  in context of the 2022 midterm. So Democrats are planning on stealing the midterms. I mean,
[1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:18.040]  that's what that means. And then big tech is going to be there to make sure nobody calls it out.
[1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:23.720]  And then the third thing happening, Alex, there is an armed standoff of gunmen at the FBI office
[1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:29.640]  in Cincinnati. So he could be organic. He could be a federal provocateur just false flagging it.
[1:21:29.640 --> 1:21:35.800]  I don't know. But I'll say this, Alex, there could be 100 gunmen outside the FBI, whether it's
[1:21:35.800 --> 1:21:42.280]  false flag provocateurs or organic, that does not justify the FBI's existence. We cannot let the FBI
[1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:47.480]  victimize themselves into 100 more years of corruption in this country. I'm not for violence.
[1:21:47.480 --> 1:21:52.120]  We're not calling for violence. The FBI needs to be shut down, whether there's no gunmen or
[1:21:52.120 --> 1:21:57.160]  1000 gunmen outside their offices. Well, that's right. Most third world countries and other
[1:21:57.160 --> 1:22:01.560]  great nations as well have fallen when they have federal police forces that decide to take over.
[1:22:01.560 --> 1:22:07.160]  And federal police forces always decide to take over. Usually within 50 years of being created,
[1:22:07.160 --> 1:22:12.440]  I'm surprised the FBI's been around like 100 years. They're just now getting around to taking over.
[1:22:12.440 --> 1:22:15.320]  But they've got political bosses that are doing it. So yeah, we're becoming
[1:22:15.320 --> 1:22:20.600]  Venezuela. And absolutely, they said in my kangaroo trial last week on national television,
[1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:25.640]  they said, our job is to silence him and everybody else likes him. So that's what this is.
[1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:30.280]  They're doing it openly. They see us like a Roman standard that they want to capture. And
[1:22:30.280 --> 1:22:34.920]  then once they've done that, they believe all the other dominoes will fall. That's why it's so
[1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:39.400]  exciting to see so much of the libertarian, conservative, nationalist, populist leadership
[1:22:39.400 --> 1:22:43.400]  getting behind info wars, understanding what's happening. But again, let's just keep asking me
[1:22:43.400 --> 1:22:49.560]  on the street at the airport, are you going off air? $49 million. How are you going to pay it?
[1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:55.480]  There's a cap in Texas at $5 plus million. And they got two more suits. They'll get the cap on
[1:22:55.480 --> 1:23:00.760]  those. That's the good news. The bad news is I don't have $2 million cash myself or in the company.
[1:23:01.640 --> 1:23:06.040]  And so we'll have to postpone some of the appeals and we are out of money. And we're in the bank
[1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:10.760]  currency so we can file a federal report and show all this. They can stop lying and saying
[1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:15.800]  I have $280 million or whatever the latest BS is. So this is an incredible moment to be alive.
[1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:22.360]  That's why we will stay on air. It was to support us. And I had no idea that we offered the book
[1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:26.200]  signed. The books are coming in next week that we ship out the weekend to that late August.
[1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:31.160]  The Great Reset in the World for the World that this could save us. I had no idea. I thought
[1:23:31.160 --> 1:23:35.880]  people buy the unsigned book five to one. They're buying three to one signed book
[1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:41.880]  set of the regular unsigned for $24. I said, well, let's have a fundraiser. Let's charge $49 for the
[1:23:41.880 --> 1:23:51.880]  signed book. Unbelievably, we've had 7,000 orders of the signed and I'm going to sign these. I think
[1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:55.560]  I can sign like six, seven a minute. We're going to do this. We're going to video take
[1:23:55.560 --> 1:23:59.720]  like a marathon and be trying to do this, but I'll sign 50,000 books and it saves us.
[1:24:00.760 --> 1:24:09.080]  At $100, we make about $86 on each book. And for credit card fees, we make about $82.
[1:24:10.040 --> 1:24:14.920]  If we sell 20,000 books, that's a couple of million dollars. That will push us over the edge.
[1:24:14.920 --> 1:24:19.160]  Plus, it'll push the book to number one. It's already in the top 10 on Amazon. So when we
[1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:24.440]  sell books on Amazon, we get a couple of bucks to fund things. But when we sell the book with this
[1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:30.760]  SaveM4Wars markup money, which is a fundraiser, you know, just on the PBS sells a coffee cup for
[1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:36.920]  50 bucks. Another coffee cup costs $5. But you're getting the coffee mug, you know, you kept PBS
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:41.560]  on the air about what you want to do. They get taxpayer money on top of the weed on. But that's
[1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:46.280]  how they get over any budgetary problems they have is, oh, get a t-shirt for $100 and a coffee
[1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:52.280]  cup for $50, get this book for $200, get this set of books for $300 and become a Platinum
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:57.000]  member, $1,000 for PBS. Well, the Commies know how to fund what they're doing. Do you know
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:00.440]  how to do that? And I'm not patronizing. It's up to you. And you've been coming through. We're
[1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:04.680]  selling. I'm kind of scared of this because I'm going to sign them all. We're selling right now
[1:25:04.680 --> 1:25:11.240]  600, 700 books a day, 20,000 again, get delivered next week. And current rates will
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:18.120]  sell 15,000 sign books, 5,000 unsigned. And that literally puts us to the pace of the bankruptcy,
[1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:22.920]  pay through these next two trials. People saw I had limited two lawyers. People go, oh, my God,
[1:25:22.920 --> 1:25:26.600]  the other side had like 15 lawyers. Well, you know, lawyers have put on a case cost hundreds of
[1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:31.560]  thousands of dollars. And the people say, well, Lauren, why don't you have more people? Because
[1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:37.080]  folks, we're maxed out. I have literally spit myself down to almost nothing. I'm not complaining.
[1:25:37.080 --> 1:25:41.640]  I trust in God. I trust in you. If those want to make donations at infowars.com,
[1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:46.360]  forward slash crypto, that whoever did that months ago with a big donation,
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:51.320]  saved us so far. Spalled donations and saved us as well, infowars.com, forward slash crypto.
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:56.680]  But go to infowars.com and get a historic signed book and know whatever happens to info wars,
[1:25:56.680 --> 1:26:01.320]  you fought the critical time of the Republic to save it and vitamin refusions back in stock,
[1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:07.240]  supermobile vitalities back in stock. There's a combo, 40% off, supermobile vitality with that too.
[1:26:07.240 --> 1:26:13.240]  So great for your body, your energy, your libido, your immune system, everybody needs it.
[1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:18.040]  That's there. That's one of the thankful listeners and our affiliates on TV and radio and all the
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:22.600]  crew and everybody because this is a real fight. They admit info wars is what they want to take
[1:26:22.600 --> 1:26:27.160]  down. They see us as a symbol of America. I'm actually extremely honored, extremely blessed,
[1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:31.800]  be persecuted like this and I mean that when I say it. I'm the happiest I've ever been. I'm sad
[1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:36.120]  for America. I'm sad for the world, but conversely, I know where I'm supposed to be. So I want to
[1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:40.760]  thank everybody for keeping us in attack formation. We're on offense. We're not on defense. We're
[1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:48.200]  going all out. I just want to thank all the crew and the producers from Scott and Daria and Matt
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:52.200]  and I want to thank Owen and I want to thank all the editors. I want to thank all the researchers
[1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:57.480]  and everybody because we have the most evil out of control forces on earth trying to take us
[1:26:57.480 --> 1:27:01.000]  down because they want us to be conformist. They want to send a message to everybody else
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:05.880]  that if you stand up, we'll destroy you like Alex Jones. But finally, even a lot of mainline
[1:27:05.880 --> 1:27:10.760]  Republicans get, we've got to back Jones. We've got to back info wars because he's the beachhead.
[1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:17.880]  He is that retainer wall. He's that sea wall holding back. And it's true. God put us in this
[1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:23.320]  position. You as a listeners, by working through you put us in this position. This is historic
[1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:28.760]  what has happened. So thank you all for your support. And if people just ordered 20,000 signed
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:37.400]  books, that gives us into the black to pay for the bankruptcy, which is expensive and pay for
[1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:42.600]  the next two show trials and stabilize things and keep going. So people ask, will you still be on
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:49.480]  air 100% because the viewers, analysts are out there going to infowarstore.com. So don't stop,
[1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:54.760]  don't quit, never surrender, share the article, share the videos. But more importantly,
[1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:59.320]  than giving money or even spread the word, pray for a global awakening. It's happening.
[1:27:59.320 --> 1:28:04.760]  The globalists are desperate. They're not winning. That's why they're trying to trigger a civil war.
[1:28:04.760 --> 1:28:08.760]  I want to hand them a time to you and Mike Adams and so much more coming up. Thank you so much.
[1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:13.080]  We really love you, my brother. Thank you, Alex. And you just said something there that's been
[1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:18.680]  really kind of just sitting in my consciousness for the last couple of weeks. We are the non
[1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:23.560]  conformists. I mean, that's what this really is. We're the non conformists. We have an audience
[1:28:23.560 --> 1:28:30.360]  of non conformists. We're not going to conform to a corrupted rotgut culture. And that's why
[1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:35.080]  they hate us, Alex, because we are not conformists. The establishment wants conformists. That's it.
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:38.840]  That's it. All these leptists posing at the Atlantic and the New York Times like they're
[1:28:38.840 --> 1:28:44.520]  rebels and they're cool. They're fighting, you know, Dr. Evil. They're fighting Lex Luthor.
[1:28:44.520 --> 1:28:48.520]  No, they work for Lex Luthor. They work for Klaus Schwab, the literal Nazi villain.
[1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:52.280]  They work for the evil. They have all the power behind them. They have all the banks.
[1:28:52.280 --> 1:28:55.480]  They have all the media. They have all the censorship. They're launching the wars. They're
[1:28:55.480 --> 1:29:02.920]  promoting the pedophilia. Sold out for more than a year and a half because of supply chain
[1:29:02.920 --> 1:29:09.400]  breakdowns. Our best selling product, Super Blue, is finally back in stock. The original
[1:29:09.400 --> 1:29:15.400]  available at infowarstore.com. It only came in three weeks ago and already half of our stock
[1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:20.600]  has sold out. So thank you all for the support. But Super Blue has a lot of fans. And you can get
[1:29:20.600 --> 1:29:26.840]  it for 40% off by itself. But when you get it in the trifecta with our activated charcoal toothpaste

[1:30:58.200 --> 1:31:03.640]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[1:31:03.640 --> 1:31:09.480]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages. And the studies are all clear. The number one cause
[1:31:09.480 --> 1:31:16.280]  of marital splits is that there's problems in the bedroom. And the number one issue men have
[1:31:16.280 --> 1:31:21.640]  is erectile dysfunction. Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because
[1:31:21.640 --> 1:31:25.720]  they don't want people having lasting, good, loving relationships. They want to break up
[1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:33.560]  society. We are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world

[1:31:58.440 --> 1:32:04.440]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S. that supplies the highest
[1:32:04.440 --> 1:32:09.960]  quality signature reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon and other U.S. government agencies.
[1:32:09.960 --> 1:32:16.920]  And now they have produced specifically for us this made in America onion line at a very affordable

[1:32:54.280 --> 1:32:57.080]  That's exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[1:32:57.080 --> 1:33:20.440]  And now the tip of the spear leading the fight to take back the nation. It's
[1:33:20.440 --> 1:33:29.720]  Owen Troyer. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Rand Paul was on Fox News last night commenting
[1:33:29.720 --> 1:33:37.720]  on the Mar-a-Lago raid. He had this to say, trust so much the government that we've gotten to the
[1:33:37.720 --> 1:33:43.000]  point where, for example, do I know that the boxes of material they took from Mar-a-Lago,
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:47.400]  that they won't put things in those boxes to entrap him? How do we know their lawyers weren't
[1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:51.880]  allowed to see the boxes go? They weren't categorized. Thousands of documents were taken.
[1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:55.720]  Yeah. How do we know that they're going to be honest with us about what's actually in the boxes?
[1:33:55.720 --> 1:33:59.720]  How do we know that was in the box before it left the residence if the lawyers weren't allowed to
[1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:03.240]  see everything? So, you know, they've lost a great deal of trust. And it's...
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:09.880]  Now, luckily the security cameras were still on at Mar-a-Lago. So potentially
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:16.680]  some, if not all of the activity will be on camera. But when they're pilfering through
[1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:21.640]  Melania, Trump's wardrobe, you know, maybe going in there, giving it the old panty sniff,
[1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:27.960]  these perverts at the Fed, at the FBI, I don't know if it'll all be on camera, but at least
[1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:35.080]  some of it will be. And thank God for Rand Paul and thank God for the others that have been
[1:34:35.080 --> 1:34:39.640]  willing to tell the truth about what this raid at Mar-a-Lago is. It's a political witch hunt.
[1:34:39.640 --> 1:34:44.200]  It's political persecution. It's all about the midterms. It's all about stopping Donald Trump
[1:34:44.200 --> 1:34:49.160]  and anyone after him from running for office, running for president. It's about scuttling and
[1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:53.160]  silencing and censoring and chilling free speech in this country for anybody that might stand up
[1:34:53.160 --> 1:35:01.320]  against the corrupt Democrat regime. And they're showing their hand right now. The mask is off.
[1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:05.640]  They've accepted their role as the bad guy. They've embraced their role as the bad guys.
[1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:14.600]  And they love it. They love it. And somewhere clanking around in their empty skulls is this
[1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:18.520]  idea that they're saving the planet for man-made climate change. But that's just the excuse that
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:25.400]  they bring forward when they want to enslave you. Oh, man-made climate change, we got to enslave you.
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:31.000]  But see, as I said in the last segment, folks, they're showing us their hand. We've got their hand.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:35.240]  New York Times today saying we've got to censor everybody else off the Internet,
[1:35:35.240 --> 1:35:42.120]  just like we got rid of Alex Jones. Twitter saying we're going to be monitoring any election
[1:35:42.120 --> 1:35:49.480]  claims during the midterms from here on out. So basically anybody that says anything Democrats
[1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:53.960]  don't like on Twitter about midterm elections is going to be removed from Twitter's platform.
[1:35:53.960 --> 1:36:01.240]  No comment from Elon Musk on this yet. Might be interesting to see if he provides commentary.
[1:36:02.760 --> 1:36:09.160]  And then you had the situation at the FBI office today with a gunman out there apparently firing
[1:36:09.160 --> 1:36:16.040]  a nail gun at agents. So it might be organic, a deranged individual out there sick and tired
[1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:20.840]  of the corruption in our government. I'm not advocating for violence, but I'm not going to
[1:36:20.840 --> 1:36:28.840]  let the FBI become the victim in all of this. Whether there's one gunman outside the FBI or
[1:36:28.840 --> 1:36:32.680]  whether there's a hundred or whether there's a thousand or whether there's a hundred thousand,
[1:36:33.240 --> 1:36:42.040]  the FBI are not the victims. The FBI is a corrupt, criminal bureaucracy that needs to be disbanded
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:52.440]  and shut down permanently. Are there good people in the FBI? Yeah. But I don't understand how you
[1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:57.560]  can be a good guy inside the FBI anymore. I don't know how you could still
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:03.160]  clock in and clock out every day or be rank and file every day in the FBI and look yourself in the
[1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:11.240]  eye every night and know and know you are working for one of the most corrupt institutions in American
[1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:20.600]  history. But see, I get it. Everybody needs a paycheck. Everybody's got to be a slave.
[1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:29.080]  So, oh, well, you know, I can't quit because I got to make money. I got bills to pay. Well, all right.
[1:37:31.400 --> 1:37:38.280]  But just know you are working for maybe the most corrupt institution in American history and certainly
[1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:48.680]  right now just in the focus for everybody calling out government corruption. But we can't let the
[1:37:48.680 --> 1:37:52.360]  FBI turn themselves into victims. Certainly, that's what they're trying to do right now,
[1:37:52.360 --> 1:38:01.640]  whether this gunman is organic or a false flag plant provocateur. The FBI are not the victims.
[1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:08.760]  Now, innocent people getting hurt at the FBI, we don't want that. But you're working for a criminal
[1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:14.360]  enterprise, you're working for a corrupt enterprise, and you're just not going to be the victim.
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:21.080]  You're not going to be the victim here. You're the bad guy. You can try to pose as the victim,
[1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:29.400]  and I expect that to come. But they set this self up. They set this whole thing up when Merrick
[1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:37.800]  Garland refused to comment on the raid at Mar-a-Lago, except to say this is turning the FBI
[1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:43.320]  into victims. We're now facing threats of violence. Well, let's see. I mean, the FBI threatens
[1:38:43.320 --> 1:38:48.200]  Americans with violence every day. The FBI stages events and lies to Americans every day.
[1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:56.280]  See, that's what it comes down to. The government is allowed to lie to you. You're not allowed
[1:38:56.280 --> 1:39:00.680]  to lie to the government. The government's allowed to run false flag operations, violent
[1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:10.120]  operations. You're not completely backwards from where it's supposed to be. Now, you have to be
[1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:19.000]  alarmed at what's going on at the IRS. They're hiring 87,000 new agents. And remember, these
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:23.960]  Democrats are the ones that want to defund the police. They're trying to backtrack on that
[1:39:23.960 --> 1:39:30.280]  hilarious. I mean, there's just hours and hours of footage of Democrats saying they want to defund
[1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:35.000]  the police, not to mention all the rallies, all the riots, all the looting, all the burning,
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:41.480]  murder attacks on police officers. They loved all of it. They promoted all of it. And then
[1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:45.400]  they realized, well, this isn't really helping us politically. Let's say that the Republicans
[1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:53.080]  wanted to defund the police. So that's just the ultimate level of Democrat party policy.
[1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:59.160]  Democrat party politics is just lie as big as you possibly can, even if the whole world knows
[1:39:59.160 --> 1:40:07.880]  it's a lie. But think about this danger where the Democrats want to defund the police, which,
[1:40:07.880 --> 1:40:14.280]  for the most part, the police are the good guys. They're in local jurisdictions. They have some
[1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:18.760]  form of a relationship with the communities that they're policing, at least, you know,
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:23.800]  long-term officers or, you know, commissioners or sheriffs and stuff like that. There's a
[1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:27.720]  relationship in that community. There's an understanding there. There's a local community
[1:40:27.720 --> 1:40:35.480]  aspect to that. So it's a lot harder for that to get corrupted. And it's a lot
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:40.520]  harder to cover up that corruption, not that it doesn't go on. And, you know, it's funny too,
[1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:46.520]  you know, all the leftists that are anti-police, all cops are bad. And then they also, you know,
[1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:54.440]  say, hey, police plant evidence on people all the time, too. Sure they do. But, oh, they won't
[1:40:54.440 --> 1:40:58.520]  mention anything about the FBI. They won't mention anything about the Mar-a-Lago raid,
[1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:04.280]  because they think they're part of the team now. And so, see, that's what it's all about.
[1:41:04.280 --> 1:41:09.640]  Why does the FBI or why does the U.S. military put out black lives matter statements or pro
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:16.440]  antifa statements or pro-sex change statements? Because that's them waving the flag that, hey,
[1:41:16.440 --> 1:41:25.800]  we've been conquered by you. We're your team now. So they got to get rid of the local police
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:30.120]  that have a relationship with the community and are a lot easier to have oversight and manage.
[1:41:31.400 --> 1:41:36.840]  And they want to defund and disarm you and make sure you don't have security.
[1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:43.480]  And then they want to hire 90,000 IRS agents and they put on their job listing that they're going
[1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:51.080]  to be carrying firearms and willing and able to use deadly force. I mean, if you don't see where
[1:41:51.080 --> 1:42:00.200]  that's going, then you really have no foresight at all. Defund and disarm police that are the
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:07.160]  actual connection with law enforcement to local communities and then replace them with a soulless,
[1:42:07.800 --> 1:42:15.160]  faceless, disconnected, bureaucratic operation that has no loyalty, respect, or connection to
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:19.720]  local communities that will just come in, run rough shot, shoot you, take your money and leave,
[1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:23.960]  and then you'll have no idea what happened, no idea who did it, no means of oversight,
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:28.840]  no means of justice. And if you don't see how that's obviously their plan here,
[1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:33.080]  then you might be a liberal because that's clearly the plan.
[1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:39.880]  And that's what Barack Obama talks about, federalize the police. This is it, folks. They're
[1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:45.880]  federalizing the police. They're turning the big powerful intelligence agencies into
[1:42:47.320 --> 1:42:53.000]  Democrat weapons against the people and then they're going to remove the local law enforcement
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:58.760]  and replace it with federal police forces that you'll have no oversight or connection with.
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:03.640]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want you to read,
[1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:09.240]  that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life, the big tech companies,
[1:43:09.240 --> 1:43:14.200]  they don't want you to read this book. They want to control what you think, what you do,
[1:43:14.200 --> 1:43:18.920]  what you read, but you don't want that. And Alex Jones doesn't want that. And this book
[1:43:18.920 --> 1:43:23.880]  shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it.
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:28.120]  And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work,
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:33.080]  that freedom is alive in this country. This is essential reading. And, you know,
[1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:37.880]  I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in. It's not going to be
[1:43:37.880 --> 1:43:42.200]  available in bookstores. It's not going to be available in libraries. They're going to try
[1:43:42.200 --> 1:43:46.840]  to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're not going to be able to do it.
[1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:51.960]  Prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset. Thank you, Alex Jones. I really appreciate
[1:43:51.960 --> 1:44:17.160]  you having me on. And I appreciate you writing this book and getting the information out there.
[1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:22.200]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here. Thank you for that word. Infowarsstore.com,
[1:44:22.200 --> 1:44:27.000]  by the way, the products he mentions, infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks. And we do have
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:32.040]  the best supplements. I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[1:44:33.080 --> 1:44:38.920]  we do the best with our supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[1:44:38.920 --> 1:44:43.640]  Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away. It's 75% off. By the way,
[1:44:43.640 --> 1:44:49.160]  it works for me. In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[1:44:49.720 --> 1:44:55.960]  Quite well, I might add. Quite well. My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[1:44:55.960 --> 1:45:01.480]  I go and see him quite often now. We brought the game changing product previously only available
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:06.680]  to major oil companies around the world. The civilian market two years ago, the bio pros
[1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:12.600]  for septic tanks for porta potties for RVs for your drains, your boats, it goes on and on. It'll
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:18.280]  eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water. But it's been so successful now. We're
[1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:26.200]  selling it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name it, because this stuff will eat anything that is
[1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:34.040]  organic. And it's exclusively available at the bio pros.com. And now infowarsstore.com. We sold
[1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:40.040]  out of this for almost a year. We made a major purchase and it is now in stock for whatever
[1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:45.080]  your need is at infowarsstore.com. You'll also find instructional videos and more information
[1:45:45.080 --> 1:45:53.240]  at infowarsstore.com or the bio pros.com made America powered by God's great creation. It is
[1:45:53.240 --> 1:46:01.960]  amazing and it funds the info war. We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse
[1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:07.400]  in the strange space between what we've known and what's to come. And right now,
[1:46:07.400 --> 1:46:13.960]  the most important thing to remember is don't panic. Stay calm because now is the time that we
[1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:20.440]  must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course. There is nothing stopping
[1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:27.240]  we the people from making our own rules and building our own society. All we got to do is
[1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:33.960]  survive the crash. And right now we still have time to prepare. The world fiat currency system
[1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:41.080]  is racing towards zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water,
[1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:48.280]  and survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready. Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials,
[1:46:48.280 --> 1:47:04.120]  storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power, and more at preparedtoday.com.
[1:47:28.200 --> 1:47:34.280]  All right, still no justification for the raid at Mar-a-Lago, which tells you there's something
[1:47:34.280 --> 1:47:41.160]  more to that story and we're not getting it. And I've kind of theorized as to what
[1:47:41.160 --> 1:47:47.560]  might be going on with that earlier in the transmission. But just the radioactive nature
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:51.720]  of that story and the fact that nobody's willing really to address it publicly tells me
[1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:59.480]  that there's something underlying there that only few people know. So I would say that Donald
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:05.800]  Trump probably knows something and a few people in his inner circle and or the FBI knows something
[1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:11.000]  or a few people at the FBI know something. And nobody wants to let the cat out of the bag right
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:15.320]  now. Somebody thinks they have the upper hand or somebody's waiting for some leverage before
[1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:21.240]  they make their next move. But everybody's saying neutral on this. I mean, it's like if you're
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:29.720]  watching an epic chess match, nobody's touched their pieces in days. And that just shows you
[1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:36.840]  whatever that last move was like, whoa, that last move was so mind blowing. Nobody wants to even
[1:48:36.840 --> 1:48:44.520]  touch the board now. So what is it? Was this just a total swing and a miss by the FBI?
[1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:49.880]  Did they think they had something there and didn't find it? Was it all for optics and then
[1:48:49.880 --> 1:48:56.120]  it totally backfired? Did Trump set a trap for the feds? Did Trump set a trap for a mole? Did
[1:48:56.120 --> 1:49:06.200]  he smoke a mole out in his own team? The lack of a move since the raid tells me there is something
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:12.200]  there that we just don't know yet. Because I don't know how you have that biggest story.
[1:49:12.200 --> 1:49:20.120]  I mean, as far as impact is concerned, as far as real world people's lives impact is
[1:49:20.120 --> 1:49:25.800]  concerned, it's not that big of a story. But this goes well beyond that. I mean, I would say the
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:31.720]  January 6 prisoners that are being tortured by Democrats and jail cells right now, political
[1:49:31.720 --> 1:49:37.560]  prisoners, I would say that that's much worse of a situation on its face than the Mar-a-Lago
[1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:42.520]  raid. But the Mar-a-Lago raid is so big and has so much gravity and so much implication
[1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:49.720]  that it probably is the biggest story in this midterm election news cycle. And nobody wants to
[1:49:49.720 --> 1:49:54.280]  get out ahead of it now. Nobody wants to steer the narrative into the next direction.
[1:49:56.280 --> 1:49:59.720]  This whole thing is a knuckleball, folks. But for the American people,
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:07.720]  any rational American person that's just not a total brainwashed leftist libtard
[1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:15.160]  knows that what happened at Mar-a-Lago is just further proof of the political persecution against
[1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:23.480]  Donald Trump, further proof that there is a deep state, and further proof that our government
[1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:32.600]  is gone completely rogue, completely rogue and is no longer serving the interest of we, the people.
[1:50:34.920 --> 1:50:41.480]  That is what's going on. And then you've got the liberal left. California University hosts
[1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:46.920]  segregate orientation. Yeah, you've got all these major universities now where they have
[1:50:46.920 --> 1:50:51.160]  graduations for black students and Hispanic students and white students segregating the
[1:50:51.160 --> 1:50:56.040]  students the reverse of Martin Luther King's dream. Of course, it's liberals that go the opposite
[1:50:56.040 --> 1:51:04.520]  way. Liberals are the ideology of regression, not progression, regression. So they're regressing
[1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:15.320]  back to their roots of bigotry and discrimination at universities. They're also turning any classroom
[1:51:15.320 --> 1:51:21.480]  that has children in it and is run by a liberal teacher into sexual grooming centers.
[1:51:22.280 --> 1:51:30.280]  And then they have their therapists and their counselors go on social media and post videos
[1:51:30.280 --> 1:51:36.600]  saying we need to be standing up for pedophiles. And they say minor attracted people
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:42.920]  are the most discriminated against people in the world. Oh, really?
[1:51:42.920 --> 1:51:48.600]  Really? Adults that rape children are discriminated against? I'd say that's a good thing.
[1:51:50.440 --> 1:51:57.240]  I think if you're a child abuser, you need to suffer severely. And I think if you're a pedophile
[1:51:57.240 --> 1:52:05.640]  child rapist, you need to be eliminated. No more sense in having you with us on this planet.
[1:52:06.520 --> 1:52:09.320]  If you're out there raping children, if you're out there as a pedophile,
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:16.520]  grooming or raping children, it's time for you to suffer severe consequences. But they're so
[1:52:16.520 --> 1:52:23.000]  emboldened now, they're so emboldened now that they've gotten away with so much sexual grooming
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:27.880]  of children, so much child abuse of children. They're going for everything, folks. They want
[1:52:27.880 --> 1:52:33.320]  the right to have sex with children. That's what this is all about. They want the right to have
[1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:40.120]  sex with children. And you know what? It kind of just hit me, actually. And I've never really
[1:52:40.120 --> 1:52:45.080]  heard this before, but it just hit me like a bolt of lightning right in my head right now.
[1:52:49.880 --> 1:52:52.440]  Are all of these people really pedophiles?
[1:52:54.360 --> 1:52:57.640]  Are all of these individuals that are sexually grooming children and
[1:52:57.640 --> 1:53:04.360]  doing this stuff to children actually pedophiles? There are certainly pedophiles out there. I mean,
[1:53:04.360 --> 1:53:09.720]  Joe Biden has certainly exhibited pedophilic behavior on dozens, if not hundreds of occasions.
[1:53:10.440 --> 1:53:15.160]  But are all these people really pedophiles? Why would they be pushing to groom children? Or why
[1:53:15.160 --> 1:53:18.520]  would they have this desire to have sex with children? I think it just hit me, folks.
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:24.040]  They can't find a single consenting adult that wants to get anywhere near them.
[1:53:24.040 --> 1:53:27.560]  And so they know the only shot they have is a brainwasher child.
[1:53:29.960 --> 1:53:37.560]  Still pedophilia. But I don't know why that just hit me right now as I'm about to go to this video
[1:53:38.920 --> 1:53:42.840]  because I just noticed it's like all these people that are promoting pedophilia
[1:53:43.480 --> 1:53:51.720]  as minor attracted persons, sexual orientation, they're all disgusting fugglies. And that's it.
[1:53:51.720 --> 1:53:58.200]  But they know that they're never going to find a consenting sexual partner or have a loving
[1:53:58.200 --> 1:54:03.560]  relationship because they're fallen souls, because they're demons. So they know the only
[1:54:03.560 --> 1:54:10.280]  chance they have is to groom children to have sex with them. My God, you liberals are sick.
[1:54:10.280 --> 1:54:18.200]  So here's an example. This is a sex therapist and counselor who says pedophiles should not
[1:54:18.200 --> 1:54:22.120]  be called pedophiles, but minor attracted persons as a sexual orientation. And it's the most
[1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:26.680]  discriminated against group in America. Yeah, I would say pedophiles should be discriminated
[1:54:26.680 --> 1:54:33.640]  against. But liberals who are promoting pedophilia because they want to engage in sexual acts with
[1:54:33.640 --> 1:54:38.760]  children are trying to say it's minor attracted persons sexual orientation. And they openly
[1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:46.600]  say it on the internet like in this video. You see her pronouns and I'm a professional counselor
[1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:53.480]  and sex therapist in Erie, Pennsylvania. And today I want to talk about minor attracted persons
[1:54:53.480 --> 1:54:58.920]  pedophiles. And I want to talk about minor attracted persons pedophiles. They are probably
[1:54:58.920 --> 1:55:05.640]  the most vilified population of folks in our culture. Good. And most folks are making incorrect
[1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:11.480]  assumptions about them without actually knowing much about them. And those assumptions create
[1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:19.640]  harm for an already marginalized population. You may have noticed that I'm using the term
[1:55:19.640 --> 1:55:27.000]  minor attracted persons sometimes abbreviated to maps, instead of the more commonly used term
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:34.120]  pedophile. And I'm doing this because the term pedophile has moved from being a diagnostic
[1:55:34.120 --> 1:55:41.880]  label to being a judgmental hurtful insult that we hurl at people in order to harm them or slander
[1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:49.160]  them. I also prefer person first language that recognizes that any label we might apply to a
[1:55:49.160 --> 1:55:55.800]  person is only part of who they are and doesn't represent everything that they are. We are all
[1:55:56.440 --> 1:56:02.840]  people first with many different facets or parts of ourselves. And this includes folks who are
[1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:11.560]  attracted to minors. So to start with, let's talk about what a minor attracted person is or who
[1:56:11.560 --> 1:56:20.120]  they are. This term simply means that the person has an enduring sexual or romantic attraction
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:26.840]  to minors. They've not chosen this attraction, just as the rest of us have not chosen whatever
[1:56:26.840 --> 1:56:33.080]  our attraction is. You don't get to choose to be heterosexual or to be gay or whatever you are,
[1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:39.960]  and you don't get to choose to be a minor attracted person. Some minor attracted persons
[1:56:39.960 --> 1:56:47.000]  are attracted to a specific age range of minors, while some are not. And some minor attracted
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:53.720]  persons are exclusively attracted to minors and are not attracted to adults at all. Some minor
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:57:01.080]  attracted persons are also attracted to adults. Now, notice the crew points out she's got some
[1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:09.080]  weird demon painting behind her. And I mean, folks, when you're openly promoting pedophilia and
[1:57:09.080 --> 1:57:12.520]  saying it should be called maps as a sexual orientation, there's obviously something wrong
[1:57:12.520 --> 1:57:17.480]  with you. You're a dark twisted soul. But you know, it just makes me go back to the WikiLeaks emails
[1:57:17.480 --> 1:57:23.560]  because we all saw the emails that talked about pizza related maps. And of course,
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:28.920]  it made no sense to us. Why would you have a pizza related map on a handkerchief? Maybe map
[1:57:28.920 --> 1:57:35.000]  didn't mean what we thought it meant. Maybe map didn't mean like a map where you try to find
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:41.960]  where you're going. Maybe maps in those WikiLeaks Democrat emails meant minor attracted person,
[1:57:41.960 --> 1:57:49.880]  aka pedophile. I don't know. I'm just trying to figure it all out. So many people over the years
[1:57:50.600 --> 1:57:56.120]  have walked up to me randomly on the street and said super male vitality is incredible.
[1:57:56.120 --> 1:58:01.400]  Why does it work so well? And the answer is very simple. It takes from Chinese medicine and other
[1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:08.440]  ancient traditions, known herbal compounds that boost libido, stamina and energy. And it comes from
[1:58:08.440 --> 1:58:15.320]  cold pressed herbs. So they're not boiling or heating up the herbs that are known to have
[1:58:15.320 --> 1:58:21.080]  these natural effects. It's cold pressed. It's been sold out for eight months or more.
[1:58:21.080 --> 1:58:28.760]  It's finally back in stock at infowarstore.com for 25% off super male vitality. And it goes great
[1:58:28.760 --> 1:58:35.560]  with X2, which is also 25% off. But if you get both these products together, they're 40% off
[1:58:35.560 --> 1:58:44.440]  in a combo at infowarstore.com. So X2 and super male vitality, 40% off together or 25% off individually
[1:58:44.440 --> 1:58:49.800]  at infowarstore.com. It's amazing. Try it today. Ladies and gentlemen, if millions of people get
[1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:53.880]  this book, our funding problems will be over and it's starting to happen. That's why I said,
[1:58:53.880 --> 1:58:57.320]  yeah, go to infowarstore.com, get the book and start shipping in a couple of weeks. The great
[1:58:57.320 --> 1:59:01.800]  reset in the war for the world. But I said go to Amazon because it's the number one book chart
[1:59:01.800 --> 1:59:06.840]  in the world. And if it goes to number one, not a political, not of history, not of US history,
[1:59:06.840 --> 1:59:11.800]  it's already number one over 40 categories like political science, you name it. 40 plus categories
[1:59:11.800 --> 1:59:19.080]  is number one. Ladies and gentlemen, drum roll, please of books in the world. The great reset in
[1:59:19.080 --> 1:59:30.440]  the war for the world is 123456789. We are now number nine in the world. This is major. This is
[1:59:30.440 --> 1:59:36.120]  political. This could fund our war chest. Just go to Amazon.com everybody and buy 10 copies.
[1:59:36.120 --> 1:59:40.840]  Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order because you read this,
[1:59:40.840 --> 1:59:44.120]  you know their whole plan how to stop them. Get the great reset in the war for the world now.
[1:59:44.120 --> 1:59:45.960]  It's going to go to number one. What do you make of that?
[1:59:45.960 --> 1:59:57.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:00:03.160 --> 2:00:08.040]  All right, folks, thank you for joining me. Mike Adams here filling in for the third hour here on
[2:00:08.040 --> 2:00:13.320]  the Alex Jones show. I want to thank Owen Schreuer and Alex is on the road. So I'm hosting remotely
[2:00:13.320 --> 2:00:18.360]  also today. We've got a bombshell segment for you today. We're going to change the pace, change
[2:00:18.360 --> 2:00:23.320]  the topic, and focus a little bit here. We're going to go on offense in terms of bringing you
[2:00:23.320 --> 2:00:29.080]  new breakthrough information that is game-changing for our world. It's going to change the entire
[2:00:29.080 --> 2:00:35.000]  dynamic of energy. It's going to take away energy scarcity from the hands of the globalists. It's
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:41.480]  going to set humanity truly free with more energy. It's a very big deal. I attempted to have our
[2:00:41.480 --> 2:00:46.360]  guest on last week, but because of changes of schedule, we were not able to get him on the
[2:00:46.360 --> 2:00:51.480]  show last week. He's able to join us today. We'll bring him in at the top of the next segment,
[2:00:51.480 --> 2:00:56.680]  coming up here in just a few minutes. You're going to learn why the government has been
[2:00:56.680 --> 2:01:03.560]  suppressing this technology for decades and why they are unable to suppress it any longer.
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:08.520]  The truth is coming out. This technology is validated. It's now confirmed and it's been
[2:01:08.520 --> 2:01:14.920]  publicly demonstrated at a physics convention. People's minds are getting blown because this
[2:01:14.920 --> 2:01:21.320]  means that humanity can no longer be controlled by energy scarcity in the way that they used to
[2:01:21.320 --> 2:01:26.920]  be controlled. This technology, which we're going to describe here, will share some pretty amazing
[2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:34.280]  announcements. It is not going to replace, however, diesel engines. It's not going to replace combustion
[2:01:34.280 --> 2:01:43.400]  engines in tractors or trains or jets or anything like that, but it produces excess heat. This
[2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:49.080]  excess heat can be used to heat homes, to heat buildings, to heat even military installations.
[2:01:49.960 --> 2:01:55.400]  With some additional engineering, it can be used to heat water to spin turbines to generate
[2:01:55.400 --> 2:02:00.920]  electricity, which is exactly how nuclear power plants work. This breakthrough is going to be able
[2:02:00.920 --> 2:02:11.320]  to replace ultimately nuclear fuel rods, and yet it produces no excess radioactive waste like
[2:02:11.320 --> 2:02:19.320]  nuclear power plants do. This is a breakthrough, decentralized, new, scientifically validated
[2:02:19.320 --> 2:02:25.720]  system of energy. It does not release any carbon dioxide. Not that CO2 is bad for the planet.
[2:02:25.720 --> 2:02:30.680]  I mean, plants love CO2, but for the greenies on the left, they'll love the fact that it doesn't
[2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:37.320]  produce any CO2. It has no emissions whatsoever. It's clean, it's abundant, and it can be made
[2:02:37.320 --> 2:02:43.160]  decentralized. It is essentially going to be rather easy to manufacture and replicate all
[2:02:43.160 --> 2:02:46.840]  across the country. And also, for the record, by the way, what I'm about to share here,
[2:02:47.560 --> 2:02:51.160]  I have no financial ties to any of this technology or any of the companies involved
[2:02:51.160 --> 2:02:55.000]  or any of the patents or anything like that. That's not what this is about. This is about
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:03:00.360]  breaking the stranglehold on humanity that is created by the globalists who are engineering
[2:03:00.360 --> 2:03:06.680]  food scarcity, energy scarcity, financial scarcity by shutting down small businesses,
[2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:10.280]  and so on. They're trying to strangle humanity by taking away health freedom,
[2:03:10.280 --> 2:03:16.280]  taking away your right to speak, and so on. We are fighting against that not by just playing
[2:03:16.280 --> 2:03:24.600]  defensively, but now you could say offensively by humanity introducing new technologies that
[2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:29.800]  break the mold, that shatter the paradigm, and that will change the history of the world forever.
[2:03:29.800 --> 2:03:34.520]  This is such a big deal. I'm very proud to be able to announce this and share this with you
[2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:41.640]  on Infowars.com because it once again shows that Infowars is the leader in new media.
[2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:48.120]  You'll remember one day, oh my gosh, I heard that on Infowars, and Infowars had the courage to break
[2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:52.760]  that news among the very first. You're going to remember that because this is going to change
[2:03:52.760 --> 2:03:57.800]  the entire world. It's going to change the dynamics of geopolitics. It's going to change
[2:03:57.800 --> 2:04:02.920]  everything about Russia, Ukraine, the Middle East, oil, all of that, and it's going to give
[2:04:02.920 --> 2:04:09.720]  America, by the way, even more energy independence because it is American scientists who are the
[2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:14.680]  leading engineers and developers of this technology right now. This can put America
[2:04:14.680 --> 2:04:20.280]  back on the map, back in the lead of breakthrough science that can change the world for the better.
[2:04:20.840 --> 2:04:25.160]  So this is great news, and I know sometimes we need some positive news.
[2:04:25.160 --> 2:04:29.720]  That's exactly what this is. You're going to hear all those details here coming up for the next hour
[2:04:29.720 --> 2:04:35.560]  exclusively here on The Alex Jones Show, and I'm guest hosting Mike Adams. I'll also be hosting,
[2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:41.480]  I believe, a part or all of the fourth hour with a different guest and some different topics as well.
[2:04:41.480 --> 2:04:45.960]  So stay with me here on The Alex Jones Show. Spread the word, tell everybody to tune in,
[2:04:45.960 --> 2:04:49.960]  break through information that's going to change the world for the better. Stay with us. We'll be
[2:04:49.960 --> 2:04:56.040]  right back with that news and more.
[2:05:38.600 --> 2:05:44.680]  And it goes great with X2, which is also 25% off, but if you get both these products together,
[2:05:44.680 --> 2:05:53.080]  they're 40% off in a combo at infowarstore.com. So X2 and super male vitality, 40% off together,

[2:05:58.120 --> 2:06:07.560]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[2:06:12.200 --> 2:06:16.760]  All right, welcome back folks to The Alex Jones Show here on infowar.com. I'm Mike Adams,
[2:06:16.760 --> 2:06:22.680]  joining remotely hosting this hour and the next with breakthrough information that is a game changer
[2:06:22.680 --> 2:06:26.680]  for our world. It's a game changer for freedom and abundance, and we're going to jump right into
[2:06:26.680 --> 2:06:32.440]  it so that you know the full details. Now, I will kind of caution you that the first time I heard
[2:06:32.440 --> 2:06:38.920]  about this technology, I thought that's impossible, that it couldn't possibly be true. There's no way
[2:06:38.920 --> 2:06:46.360]  that it could work, but this is not some kind of fantasy. This is validated, confirmed, publicly
[2:06:46.360 --> 2:06:53.080]  demonstrated cutting edge science, and it's called low energy nuclear reactions, or LENR.
[2:06:53.080 --> 2:06:58.360]  And there are some very, very wealthy people and some very intelligent, some of the highest IQ
[2:06:58.360 --> 2:07:05.400]  people in the country are right now working on trying to develop the theories that explain the
[2:07:05.400 --> 2:07:12.280]  phenomenon that is confirmed to be happening, which is the generation of excess heat using solid
[2:07:12.280 --> 2:07:18.760]  state hydrogen hot tube technology as it's called to generate excess heat at room temperature
[2:07:18.760 --> 2:07:26.920]  by converting a very tiny amount of mass into this excess energy. This is going to set humanity free
[2:07:26.920 --> 2:07:32.920]  if we can get it fully commercialized and shared with the world and stop the suppression of this
[2:07:32.920 --> 2:07:38.840]  technology. Now, I've got a special guest joining me who has been involved in this technology for
[2:07:38.840 --> 2:07:43.720]  many years. I've been following this also for years, and yet this is the first time that we've
[2:07:43.720 --> 2:07:50.840]  talked in detail about it here publicly, but our guest is going to sort of, he's been in the meetings,
[2:07:50.840 --> 2:07:56.760]  he's briefed the scientists, he's seen the reactions, he's seen the power plays, the investors,
[2:07:56.760 --> 2:08:01.960]  the money plays, all of it, and he can bring us details that you won't hear anywhere else.
[2:08:01.960 --> 2:08:07.000]  So this is a world exclusive of a breakthrough piece of technology that's going to change the
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:12.760]  world and help decentralize energy, which will break the stranglehold on humanity by the globalist.
[2:08:12.760 --> 2:08:19.400]  So let's bring in our guest who I will call, well, James, James, are you going public with
[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:22.200]  your full name at this point? You're just going by James, you tell me.
[2:08:23.560 --> 2:08:25.800]  Well, I'll go by James Martinez, it's okay.
[2:08:26.680 --> 2:08:31.320]  Okay, all right, okay. Well, James Martinez then, and I want to thank you for joining us today,
[2:08:31.320 --> 2:08:38.360]  especially on such a short notice. Now, let's back up because a lot of people have never heard
[2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:44.120]  of this before. We need to bring them up to speed. We need to explain what is cold fusion,
[2:08:44.120 --> 2:08:50.200]  which is really no longer the term used for this, what is meant by low energy nuclear reactions,
[2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:55.080]  and specifically tell us what has just been demonstrated, validated, and announced
[2:08:55.080 --> 2:08:58.360]  at a physics conference that proves that this is real. Go ahead.
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:10.520]  Well, first, I want to say congratulations to this network because I planned long ago to make
[2:09:10.520 --> 2:09:15.320]  sure that this network would be the one that would make a sort of formal announcement.
[2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:22.920]  And that was through David Knight, who interviewed the chief executive officer
[2:09:22.920 --> 2:09:30.680]  of the leading cold fusion company now in the world many years ago to prepare everybody.
[2:09:31.320 --> 2:09:37.640]  Because it was always my contention that this technology be discussed before it comes out
[2:09:38.280 --> 2:09:46.120]  rather than when it already comes out. So I want to first say that. So this is important for people
[2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:51.400]  because I know that this network is under a tremendous amount of scrutiny unnecessarily,
[2:09:51.400 --> 2:09:58.440]  I might add. So this is once again the Info Wars family of freedom fighters and so forth
[2:09:58.440 --> 2:10:05.960]  were correct on this. So that's that's first thing I want to say. Second thing is I got involved
[2:10:05.960 --> 2:10:13.880]  with this in 89. I had heard from colleagues of mine at that time that there is going to be
[2:10:15.320 --> 2:10:19.480]  an announcement. It's very vague when I was told about this. I thought, you know,
[2:10:19.480 --> 2:10:24.360]  this is going to be an announcement regarding the energy sector. And that came from the late
[2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:32.120]  Dr. Andre Breharge who told me and all of it came true. So in 1989 when I first saw the announcement,
[2:10:32.120 --> 2:10:40.360]  I'm not a scientist. I'm more of a media ecologist. So the concern for media ecology is the effects
[2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:46.680]  of technology on culture and what it does and how to prepare for the effects of when something
[2:10:46.680 --> 2:10:52.440]  like this happens. So in 89 when I first heard about this, my first reaction was, well,
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:58.360]  the career of these two gentlemen, Stanley Ponds and Fleischman, who's going to be destroyed
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  or they will be killed because of the effect that that announcement had on the nuclear industry
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  at that time. The nuclear industry has lost tremendous amount of money. So let me just add,
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:16.120]  you're referring to the Fleischman and Ponds announcement in 1989 where they demonstrated
[2:11:16.120 --> 2:11:21.560]  cold fusion at room temperature and it originally made, I think, the cover of Time Magazine at
[2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:28.680]  that time. And then it was very rapidly, quote, debunked by the physics community establishment
[2:11:28.680 --> 2:11:34.040]  and the hot fusion advocates who said, no, it's impossible. You can't do this at room temperature.
[2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:39.640]  We need billions of dollars in funding to do this in another way. But I'm sorry to interrupt,
[2:11:39.640 --> 2:11:45.320]  but I just want to provide the background context. But since that time, then both of these
[2:11:45.320 --> 2:11:51.800]  pathways of scientific research have progressed quite dramatically, both hot fusion and what was
[2:11:51.800 --> 2:11:55.880]  called cold fusion now called low energy nuclear reactions. It's just that hot fusion requires
[2:11:55.880 --> 2:11:59.960]  billions and tens of billions of dollars in funding and they've made a lot of progress.
[2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:04.200]  But then low energy nuclear reactions is done with, let's say, only millions of dollars instead
[2:12:04.200 --> 2:12:10.200]  of billions. And it's a much simpler technology. And yet both of these pathways are now validated
[2:12:10.200 --> 2:12:19.000]  as ways to produce excess energy. Are they not? Absolutely correct. The conflict is basically
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:30.040]  what you just said. It's the big business versus the new science, which is cannot be ignored anymore
[2:12:30.040 --> 2:12:37.480]  by the establishment because of events that just took place a couple of weeks ago at the ICCF 24
[2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:43.320]  event where they demonstrated this technology. Tell us about that event and the website for
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:53.560]  that is that ICCF24.com. Is that the site?.org. I'm sorry. ICCF24.org. And that event was a
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:58.360]  gathering of physicists all presenting papers and theories and some demonstrations. And this
[2:12:58.360 --> 2:13:03.400]  sterling engine powered by this solid state low energy nuclear reaction system was demonstrated
[2:13:03.400 --> 2:13:07.880]  for people to see. What was the reaction? And we have a video of that, by the way, that our
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:11.560]  producers here can show. But what was the reaction when people saw that with their own eyes for the
[2:13:11.560 --> 2:13:18.680]  first time? Well, there wasn't much of a reaction because most of the people there that were attending
[2:13:18.680 --> 2:13:23.000]  were all the leaders in the field that came from all over the world. They already know this is
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:32.200]  going on. They've been known it's going on for quite some time. The emphasis wasn't so much on
[2:13:32.200 --> 2:13:40.920]  whether or not they had a device they're working on that was there, but it was more on still the
[2:13:40.920 --> 2:13:47.480]  ongoing fencing that is going on between old consciousness versus new consciousness and
[2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:56.760]  the power struggle that exists between the two because of something that is interfering with
[2:13:56.760 --> 2:14:06.120]  everything that is greed, monopolies, patents, control, etc. Those matters when it meets with
[2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:13.800]  this do not mix. And I want to say this for everybody, because this is the most important part.
[2:14:13.800 --> 2:14:20.520]  The most important part is most of the people that were attending this were probably 70 years old
[2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:27.240]  and up. They're all old men who committed their entire lives and careers to seeing this thing through.
[2:14:28.360 --> 2:14:35.560]  And the unifying thing that brought them together was they wanted to leave something behind
[2:14:36.680 --> 2:14:41.880]  for their children and for the world, which is why they spent enormous amounts of time and
[2:14:41.880 --> 2:14:49.800]  sacrifice, which people have no idea the level of sacrifice that's taken to get this far. And all
[2:14:49.800 --> 2:14:55.880]  of these older gentlemen were from all walks in different countries. I get that James. I'm sorry
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:15:04.200]  to interject. Let's remember that our audience does not yet know what you know about how this has
[2:15:04.200 --> 2:15:07.960]  been validated and how this is real and all the people you're talking about. They've known for a
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:12.840]  long time because these experiments have been replicated by the United States Navy, laboratories
[2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:17.720]  in Japan and Russia and so on all over the world. We got to go to break here shortly, but when we
[2:15:17.720 --> 2:15:23.960]  come back, I'd like you to talk about how do we know that this is real? What is the evidence that
[2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:32.440]  this excess energy is being produced? And then who is working on the physics models that can
[2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:37.240]  actually explain this and what's going to be required in terms of expanding our current
[2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:42.840]  state of understanding of fusion and the table of elements and how things work in the real world
[2:15:42.840 --> 2:15:48.120]  because we're going to have to rework some of our knowledge of truly the laws of physics. So
[2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:51.640]  stay with us James. I appreciate you. Thank you for your patience. We'll be right back after
[2:15:51.640 --> 2:15:55.480]  this break with all of those explanations and more straight ahead. Stay with us.
[2:15:58.360 --> 2:16:03.320]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want you to read
[2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:08.920]  that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life, the big tech companies,
[2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:13.880]  they don't want you to read this book. They want to control what you think, what you do,
[2:16:13.880 --> 2:16:19.080]  what you read, but you don't want that. And Alex Jones doesn't want that. And this book shows you
[2:16:19.080 --> 2:16:24.520]  what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it. And so by buying
[2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:30.120]  this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work, that freedom is alive in this country.
[2:16:30.120 --> 2:16:36.280]  This is a central reading. And you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks
[2:16:36.280 --> 2:16:41.240]  in. It's not going to be available in bookstores. It's not going to be available in libraries.
[2:16:41.240 --> 2:16:45.480]  They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're not going
[2:16:45.480 --> 2:16:50.840]  to be able to do it prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset. Thank you, Alex Jones.
[2:16:50.840 --> 2:16:55.960]  I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book and getting the information
[2:16:55.960 --> 2:17:03.720]  out there. Seven months ago in December of 2021, we launched the first three coin founding member
[2:17:03.720 --> 2:17:08.920]  series, George Washington slaying the dragon. Then we launched the tree of liberty coin and
[2:17:08.920 --> 2:17:15.960]  finally the second amendment, come and take it, Molon Labe coin. There are only 75 points left
[2:17:15.960 --> 2:17:25.560]  in the three point series exclusively right now at 1776 point.com. And for the final 75 people
[2:17:25.560 --> 2:17:30.120]  become founding members for this big project we're launching in the near future. You'll also get a

[2:19:58.600 --> 2:20:04.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:04.600 --> 2:20:19.320]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm Mike Adams and we're having a science breakthrough
[2:20:19.320 --> 2:20:25.480]  conversation today. And I know it's difficult for us to talk about this right now with the
[2:20:25.480 --> 2:20:32.360]  weaponization of the IRS targeting the American people, the rogue nature of the FBI just off the
[2:20:32.360 --> 2:20:38.040]  reservation going insane running a war against conservative America and all of Trump's people.
[2:20:38.840 --> 2:20:43.080]  I know that the dollar collapse is approaching and they're going to try to
[2:20:43.720 --> 2:20:47.960]  thrust all of us into a central bank digital currency control us. And I know that we're fighting
[2:20:47.960 --> 2:20:54.040]  a defensive war, it seems every day we're trying to just stop the tyranny that's marching upon us
[2:20:54.040 --> 2:21:01.000]  day by day, step by step. But we can't just win by fighting a defensive war on every issue
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:05.960]  affecting humanity in the future of human civilization. From time to time, we have to have
[2:21:05.960 --> 2:21:12.760]  breakthroughs of new solutions that actually create decentralization and reduce our dependence on
[2:21:12.760 --> 2:21:19.000]  globalism or centrally controlled systems. In fact, this was the whole idea behind cryptocurrency.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:24.120]  What about a decentralized currency that the central banks can't control so that we can buy,
[2:21:24.120 --> 2:21:30.680]  sell and trade with each other using a peer to peer non centralized system that is not easily
[2:21:30.680 --> 2:21:34.920]  a shut down by the powers that be. And I think that's been proven they can't shut it down very
[2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:40.680]  easily, although the Treasury is now outlawing some of the Bitcoin mixing services, you know,
[2:21:40.680 --> 2:21:45.400]  just to make it more difficult for people. But what about energy decentralization?
[2:21:45.400 --> 2:21:49.560]  That's what we're talking about today. A breakthrough technology that was really first
[2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:54.280]  demonstrated in 1989, but it was difficult to reproduce at that time. And it goes back to
[2:21:54.280 --> 2:22:00.760]  Fleischmann and Ponds at the University of Salt Lake University of Utah, Salt Lake City. But
[2:22:00.760 --> 2:22:07.480]  since in the decade since this has now been refined, it's been validated. And it's not a
[2:22:07.480 --> 2:22:12.440]  it's not a miracle replacement for oil. Let me be clear, this does not replace combustion engines
[2:22:12.440 --> 2:22:18.600]  in any way. What it does is it produces excess heat. So it has to use a little bit of energy
[2:22:18.600 --> 2:22:24.840]  itself, but it multiplies the effect of that energy to produce excess heat that can heat buildings,
[2:22:24.840 --> 2:22:32.280]  heat water, heat, you know, on ranches and farms, greenhouses. Look about what's happening in Western
[2:22:32.280 --> 2:22:36.520]  Europe right now where they're not getting the natural gas from Russia, because the Nord Stream
[2:22:36.520 --> 2:22:42.920]  One pipeline has been shut down to about 20%. A big question in Germany, you know, in France,
[2:22:42.920 --> 2:22:47.800]  in Spain, in the UK is how are you going to heat your buildings this winter? They're taking short
[2:22:47.800 --> 2:22:52.760]  cold showers now because they don't have the heat just to heat their water. Well, here's a solution.
[2:22:53.400 --> 2:22:58.280]  And I brought on James Martinez because he is the expert who has monitored this situation for years.
[2:22:58.840 --> 2:23:04.280]  He knows that this is a solution that's proven that is ready to be licensed to boiler companies,
[2:23:04.280 --> 2:23:09.320]  ready to be adopted worldwide. It's here. The future changes from here forward. So James,
[2:23:09.320 --> 2:23:15.000]  welcome back. Thank you for joining us today. Talk to us about how we know that like I said
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:19.080]  before the break, how do we know that this is working? What's the proof of this?
[2:23:21.400 --> 2:23:25.000]  Well, I would say for the people that have never heard this before,
[2:23:25.720 --> 2:23:30.760]  first step is go to watch the 60 Minutes Interview that took place many years ago where they
[2:23:30.760 --> 2:23:36.440]  validated all of this. All this was validated primarily in the United States at SRI International
[2:23:36.440 --> 2:23:42.360]  for a long time. It was not something that was done immediately and people did not jump to conclusions.
[2:23:42.360 --> 2:23:47.480]  This has gone through an enormous amount of scrutiny by many, many people for a long time.
[2:23:47.480 --> 2:23:53.080]  SRI International is where the internet came out of. It's also where other technologies that
[2:23:53.080 --> 2:23:59.720]  have profoundly changed the entire planet came from there. I know the people involved that
[2:23:59.720 --> 2:24:08.920]  handled the measuring of the accessi, Dr. Fran Tanzella, who did that. And he was so impressed
[2:24:08.920 --> 2:24:17.320]  by the findings, as is many other people, that he's now dedicated his rest of his career to bring
[2:24:17.320 --> 2:24:22.520]  this forth. Now, there were other third-party verifications with other people in all over
[2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:27.400]  the world. One of them was Andrea Rossi out of Italy. There's multiple countries that are
[2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:31.720]  involved with this and been involved with it for a long time. And the fact that we've arrived at
[2:24:31.720 --> 2:24:35.880]  this position where now people are going out on a ledge and putting everything on the line,
[2:24:35.880 --> 2:24:43.800]  saying, okay, here it is, now the conversation is totally different. Our conversation now,
[2:24:43.800 --> 2:24:48.280]  and I would tell everybody, because one of the most important things that took place at that
[2:24:48.280 --> 2:24:53.960]  event that I attended is I got to meet Rob Duncan. Rob Duncan was the gentleman in the 60 minutes
[2:24:53.960 --> 2:24:58.600]  interview. And he was the gentleman sent in to measure the measuring stick, so to speak,
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:05.880]  to measure the calorie and to show and prove there was accessi. He was there. And I sat next to him
[2:25:05.880 --> 2:25:11.320]  with a bunch of Navy guys and other people that were attending. And I got to hear the story about
[2:25:11.320 --> 2:25:16.040]  what happened after that interview was done by 60 minutes. I even called 60 minutes a couple days
[2:25:16.040 --> 2:25:23.480]  later, actually, to tell him what's really going on now. And Rob Duncan, he said, very simply,
[2:25:23.480 --> 2:25:29.000]  just check the data. I read the data. I looked at the data. I follow the data. That's what we're
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:34.280]  supposed to do as scientists. And then he went into the whole explanation of what happened after
[2:25:34.280 --> 2:25:39.080]  that interview took place, which I didn't know about. And none of the other people at that table,
[2:25:39.080 --> 2:25:47.800]  I was with heard what happened to him. And the intellectual threats that were made because
[2:25:47.800 --> 2:25:53.640]  of that coming out piece of saying, yes, Pons and Fleishman were correct. We've got accessi are
[2:25:53.640 --> 2:25:59.800]  profound. And it's science. So for for a couple of decades, I'm sorry to interrupt, but this sounds
[2:25:59.800 --> 2:26:06.120]  a lot like when doctors were talking about what works to stop COVID, you know, included the late
[2:26:06.120 --> 2:26:11.320]  Zev Zelenko talking about quercetin and zinc and vitamin C and so on. And of course, that was
[2:26:11.320 --> 2:26:18.040]  immediately suppressed because it would have saved people and reduce, you know, hospitalization and
[2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:23.720]  death by ventilator and so on. So here's something that's just like that, but it's been going on
[2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:30.520]  for decades where here's a solution for humanity that's actually kind of simple. You know, you
[2:26:30.520 --> 2:26:35.320]  don't have to have a multi-billion dollar hot fusion reactor with, you know, magnetic levitation
[2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:40.360]  fields and all that stuff, which is what the hot fusion people work on. You can do this with
[2:26:40.360 --> 2:26:46.280]  with some, I don't know, some palladium and some special materials, but at room temperature in
[2:26:46.280 --> 2:26:50.520]  something the size of like a toaster oven or maybe a little bit larger, like a like a mini
[2:26:50.520 --> 2:26:56.360]  fridge or something. So this has been suppressed all this time. And you've seen that, right? I mean,
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:27:01.080]  you've seen scientists just blacklisted from the industry for daring to talk about the true data
[2:27:01.080 --> 2:27:07.560]  they saw. Yeah, that is the main problem. And it has been the main problem in this field, because
[2:27:07.560 --> 2:27:14.280]  there's too many people that are gaslighting others at the very top from intellectual rooftops
[2:27:14.280 --> 2:27:20.280]  saying this can't exist and this is what reality is and so forth. And the scrutiny that scientists
[2:27:20.280 --> 2:27:24.760]  have to go through in this particular field, it's still there in a minimal level now. It's very
[2:27:24.760 --> 2:27:30.280]  minimal. But I've spoke to a lot of guys there, including young scientists that were speaking
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:35.960]  to me and saying, you know, I'm going to be going and doing my doctorate at a major university.
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:41.160]  At a major university in England. And what do you think? Should I do it? Should I do it on
[2:27:41.160 --> 2:27:46.440]  L.A. and R? And I looked at him like, what are you doing? Of course you should do it on L.A.
[2:27:46.440 --> 2:27:51.560]  R. Sometimes you have to forget your head and grab your balls and get on with it. Where is your
[2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:56.520]  courage? I mean, are you seeing what's going on here? Are you are you aware of what has just
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:02.440]  happened here? And they were aware, but there's still this level of fear from authority figures
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:06.120]  having to do with this. But it's too late now. We're past that. We're way past that.
[2:28:06.680 --> 2:28:13.320]  This is a profound change in the human condition. How is this going to be rolled out then? Is it
[2:28:13.320 --> 2:28:19.000]  going to be licensed to companies? Are people going to be able to have like home boiler heaters
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:24.600]  that they can license? Or are they going to be major manufacturers like big industrial
[2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:27.880]  manufacturers licensing this technology and putting it into commercial buildings?
[2:28:27.880 --> 2:28:33.720]  I mean, we're about to go to break, but tell us how this is going to look as it rolls out in the
[2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:40.280]  years ahead. All those discussions have been underway for a long time. It's going to be the
[2:28:40.280 --> 2:28:46.040]  heating market that comes first because it's the easiest entry that's okay. All right. Hold that
[2:28:46.040 --> 2:28:49.160]  thought. We're going to go to break. We're going to come back and we're going to talk about what
[2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:54.040]  this means for Western Europe, for Russia, for geopolitics in the world, and maybe peace for
[2:28:54.040 --> 2:29:01.240]  humanity. We'll be back with those topics and much more. Sold out for more than a year and a half

[2:32:58.920 --> 2:33:04.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:04.920 --> 2:33:20.360]  We now take you live to the central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[2:33:20.360 --> 2:33:25.640]  It's Mike Adams. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:29.080 --> 2:33:33.720]  All right, let's let's back up folks because I haven't done a good enough job yet of describing
[2:33:33.720 --> 2:33:37.800]  the monumental global change that this is going to cause all around the world.
[2:33:38.440 --> 2:33:43.880]  I'm going to bring in a term that you probably never heard before. It's another technology
[2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:49.720]  that can be coupled with low energy nuclear reactions and together they generate electricity.
[2:33:49.720 --> 2:33:54.920]  And this can be decentralized. You can have power without a power grid. This there's some
[2:33:54.920 --> 2:33:59.880]  engineering required. This isn't like an off the shelf thing you can buy yet. But let me introduce
[2:33:59.880 --> 2:34:05.880]  you to this term and we have our guests continuing with us James Martinez. But the term is thermo
[2:34:05.880 --> 2:34:12.920]  photovoltaics. Thermo photovoltaics. Now thermo photovoltaics, this is technology and this has
[2:34:12.920 --> 2:34:18.520]  all been demonstrated by MIT scientists. There are patents on this. There's a lot of articles
[2:34:18.520 --> 2:34:23.320]  out there in the science world all over the science websites. Thermo photovoltaics,
[2:34:23.320 --> 2:34:28.680]  it's a special kind of system where you have a substance usually a special alloy that when it
[2:34:28.680 --> 2:34:35.880]  is heated it gives off infrared radiation. And then you have special you could call them
[2:34:35.880 --> 2:34:40.520]  solar panels but they're not solar they're photovoltaic panels that generate electricity upon
[2:34:40.520 --> 2:34:46.280]  exposure to those infrared wavelengths. Okay so you got me you got you got something getting hot
[2:34:46.280 --> 2:34:51.960]  and it kind of glows with infrared light and then this light is picked up by this panel and this
[2:34:51.960 --> 2:34:58.840]  panel converts it into current just like that. It's heat to electricity and based on new information
[2:34:58.840 --> 2:35:03.800]  about this that I just read last week and covered on my own show on my own website the efficiency
[2:35:03.800 --> 2:35:09.320]  of this process is now approaching about 40 percent which is unheard of. I mean that's a breakthrough
[2:35:10.040 --> 2:35:15.640]  and what this means folks is that if you can produce excess heat which is happening through
[2:35:15.640 --> 2:35:19.320]  low energy nuclear reactions which is what we're talking about that's our guest James.
[2:35:19.320 --> 2:35:25.560]  You can produce excess heat you can convert the heat into current DC current like what comes off
[2:35:25.560 --> 2:35:32.600]  a solar panel except this system folks runs 24 seven whereas solar panels obviously only work
[2:35:32.600 --> 2:35:37.080]  when the sun is out and even not very well half of that time because the sun's at the wrong angle
[2:35:37.080 --> 2:35:41.640]  might be clouds or rain or whatever and you know wind turbines don't work when the wind isn't blowing
[2:35:41.640 --> 2:35:46.760]  so all this green energy stuff that's out there it doesn't work more than half the time more than
[2:35:46.760 --> 2:35:52.920]  half the time low energy nuclear reactions excess heat combined with thermo photovoltaics that can
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:36:00.200]  produce electricity instantly on demand 24 seven with no carbon emissions no radioactive waste
[2:36:00.200 --> 2:36:04.840]  and this technology exists right now and if I sound excited about this yeah heck yeah I am
[2:36:04.840 --> 2:36:10.680]  this is a game changer so James let me ask your opinion on that I'm sure the scientists you talk
[2:36:10.680 --> 2:36:15.240]  to they understand that if you have heat you can generate electricity through systems like the one
[2:36:15.240 --> 2:36:20.840]  I just described are they already thinking ahead about how this could be used to create off the
[2:36:20.840 --> 2:36:29.640]  shelf electricity generation systems they're already producing electricity I was there and
[2:36:29.640 --> 2:36:35.080]  when I met with the navy guys and other science guys that are involved these are the guys that
[2:36:35.080 --> 2:36:41.640]  were already talking to 60 minutes following up with 60 minutes on what was going on I came up
[2:36:41.640 --> 2:36:45.400]  with three guys were standing right in front of me and they said James we're producing electricity
[2:36:45.400 --> 2:36:52.040]  we don't know how but we're producing electricity now what do we do and what do you mean they don't
[2:36:52.040 --> 2:37:01.320]  know how I mean but what are they saying the problem has been is that with something like this
[2:37:01.960 --> 2:37:08.280]  it has to do with the recoding of language recoding of perception and then getting everybody to agree
[2:37:08.280 --> 2:37:15.080]  that this certain thing is happening and then getting everybody to finally once they got to that
[2:37:15.080 --> 2:37:23.400]  point move forward in a systematic logical way and Google is financed massive millions and millions
[2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:30.280]  of dollars into the research into this in fact it was those that particular company that produced
[2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:39.720]  the nature article that was very very important in terms of they wanted to be able to make sure 100
[2:37:40.760 --> 2:37:47.800]  that this was producing access heat now we've already produced electricity in very small amounts
[2:37:47.800 --> 2:37:54.840]  and these navy guys have already done it as well we're past that point but the problem that exists
[2:37:54.840 --> 2:38:00.600]  right now and it's not really a problem it has to do with semantics and that's what science
[2:38:01.480 --> 2:38:07.320]  is arguing about behind the scenes all right so so if I could translate this in a lay person terms
[2:38:08.040 --> 2:38:13.640]  this phenomenon is real the phenomenon is observable it's reproducible access heat's being
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:18.120]  produced and from that there's some small amount of electricity it's being produced the problem is
[2:38:18.120 --> 2:38:26.360]  trying to agree on the theory the model that describes the reality of this phenomenon so physics
[2:38:26.360 --> 2:38:33.400]  is a system of models just to let our viewers know physics is not reality when when physicists
[2:38:33.400 --> 2:38:39.240]  talk about oh our formula says this and this and this you're modeling the world you are not the
[2:38:39.240 --> 2:38:45.880]  real world reality is created by well god and the cosmos you know it has its own way of doing things
[2:38:45.880 --> 2:38:51.480]  physics is just trying to describe the cosmic truths that are out there the interactions cause
[2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:57.720]  and effect the flow of time and all of those things and physics has to constantly change its
[2:38:57.720 --> 2:39:02.520]  language its models its understanding the expansion of knowledge I mean think about it we went from
[2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:08.440]  Newtonian physics to like string theory in theory quantum theory nobody can even explain
[2:39:08.440 --> 2:39:13.880]  quantum computers and yet the national institute of standards and technology the nist is running
[2:39:13.880 --> 2:39:19.080]  I think like 16 qubit quantum computers maybe it's 32 qubits I think google is running like
[2:39:19.080 --> 2:39:25.720]  56 qubits now no one can explain how that works but it works it's reliable is that kind of a
[2:39:25.720 --> 2:39:32.680]  good metaphor for what we're dealing with here you hit it right on target absolutely correct
[2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:39.640]  there's a delay switch with the commercialization and deployment of this this could have been done
[2:39:39.640 --> 2:39:45.960]  and out the door many many many years ago but the problem has been about what I just mentioned
[2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:52.360]  and also the disruptive nature but we're supposed to be in a disruptive state as a species as a
[2:39:52.360 --> 2:40:00.520]  human family so this has begun now I mean the only clap that I heard while I was there is when
[2:40:00.520 --> 2:40:05.640]  ARPA announced that they were going to be putting money in research into this to the people that
[2:40:05.640 --> 2:40:11.800]  were there that was like a big deal they're like wow we do have a reason to live now we're validated
[2:40:11.800 --> 2:40:18.040]  all these old science guys really so excited by that but isn't this see this energy abundance
[2:40:18.040 --> 2:40:23.400]  runs contradictory to the current goals of the depopulation globalist because they want to reduce
[2:40:23.400 --> 2:40:27.960]  the population of the planet by seven billion people or more and in order to do that they have
[2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:32.040]  to shut down the economies they have to engineer food scarcity mass starvation they have to shut
[2:40:32.040 --> 2:40:38.040]  down the energy infrastructure which they are doing so if I mean doesn't that explain why there's so
[2:40:38.040 --> 2:40:44.920]  much suppression of this because if if people can replicate a relatively simple easy to build I
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:50.600]  shouldn't say easy I mean it's taken many years and a lot of money but easier than hot fusion for
[2:40:50.600 --> 2:40:55.560]  sure but if this can become widespread it kind of makes it hard for the globalist to take everybody
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:41:02.360]  out by cutting off the power grid doesn't it absolutely correct when roger roger banister
[2:41:02.360 --> 2:41:09.160]  broke the four-minute mile that was impossible but moments later everybody was doing it
[2:41:10.360 --> 2:41:15.480]  this is so far out of the box now and there's so many people involved in multiple countries
[2:41:15.480 --> 2:41:20.680]  and research and development in this that it's you know this is too late we've passed the
[2:41:20.680 --> 2:41:26.680]  the danger zone and a lot of people are going to figure out how this works themselves and they will
[2:41:26.680 --> 2:41:34.920]  model what the leading company has done in certain forms because that's what we do so I've been
[2:41:34.920 --> 2:41:39.880]  preparing the public for a long time I've spoken all over the world about this I've spoken to the
[2:41:39.880 --> 2:41:44.600]  British government I've spoken there's there's multiple countries that are involved in this
[2:41:44.600 --> 2:41:52.440]  and that are just waiting for the birth of this new baby to be born and that's very close now
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:56.440]  but I might add and I want to say it here for this audience because it's really important
[2:41:56.440 --> 2:42:01.800]  because I had private meetings with people there and everybody's pretty exhausted
[2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:07.240]  the science guys especially the US guys and they're saying now and they're suggesting that
[2:42:07.240 --> 2:42:12.280]  if they don't get cooperation from the United States meaning the people of the United States
[2:42:12.280 --> 2:42:17.480]  they're going to go to Europe as they should because we have been discussing this in public
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:24.520]  for a very long time here and abroad and that's because Europe they're they're waiting totally
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:28.040]  supportive of this there's Nordic countries that have already invited these scientists
[2:42:28.040 --> 2:42:31.880]  over there and they've been in negotiations all of this has been underway behind the scenes
[2:42:31.880 --> 2:42:35.800]  for a very long time sorry to cut you off we're going to go to break but there's an easy way
[2:42:35.800 --> 2:42:40.840]  to get US government funding for this company just make Nancy Pelosi a shareholder all the money
[2:42:40.840 --> 2:42:47.240]  will come flowing right in and it'll be a done deal by the billions so yeah there are solutions here
[2:42:47.240 --> 2:42:51.560]  that are easy easy to find uh you're watching the Alice Jones show we'll be back right after
[2:42:51.560 --> 2:42:59.160]  this break with more on the topic of abundant energy for humanity so many people over the years
[2:42:59.880 --> 2:43:05.400]  have walked up to me randomly on the street and said super male vitality is incredible
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:10.680]  why does it work so well and the answer is very simple it takes from chinese medicine and other
[2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:18.520]  ancient traditions known herbal compounds that boost libido stamina and energy and it comes from cold
[2:43:18.520 --> 2:43:25.160]  pressed herbs so they're not boiling or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural
[2:43:25.160 --> 2:43:32.040]  effects it's cold pressed it's been sold out for eight months or more it's finally back in stock
[2:43:32.040 --> 2:43:40.760]  at infowarstore.com for 25% off super male vitality and it goes great with x2 which is also 25%
[2:43:40.760 --> 2:43:47.320]  off but if you get both these products together they're 40% off in a combo at infowarstore.com
[2:43:47.320 --> 2:43:55.480]  so x2 and super male vitality 40% off together or 25% off individually at infowarstore.com
[2:43:55.480 --> 2:44:01.240]  it's amazing try it today i don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a
[2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:06.680]  farmer or rancher a doctor a lawyer or a millionaire fortune and money magazine have all done these
[2:44:06.680 --> 2:44:11.640]  profiles you see it every year 30 different tax returns 30 different answers 50 different tax
[2:44:11.640 --> 2:44:17.480]  returns 50 different answers and almost all of them just screw you over especially the big firms
[2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:22.120]  and the big tax groups because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:27.000]  understanding this and knowing this so it's a very important situation with inflation
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:33.640]  all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do things tax wise it's legal and lawful
[2:44:33.640 --> 2:44:38.200]  that allows you to keep more your money we wouldn't even be here if i hadn't gotten great tax advice
[2:44:38.200 --> 2:44:45.400]  in the last few years the only way you fail is not writing down the url jonestaxrelief.com
[2:44:45.400 --> 2:44:59.320]  one word jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-904-285 833-904-285 info wars has been vindicated
[2:44:59.320 --> 2:45:04.360]  we've been proven right world government the new world order is out of the open and now more than
[2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:11.880]  ever the forces of satan are trying to shut down this broadcast the forces of anti-human godless
[2:45:11.880 --> 2:45:17.720]  new world order are out of control so now realize we have pushed them out of the light we have pushed
[2:45:17.720 --> 2:45:22.440]  them out in the open and they are so upset and they are so scared so well you still can because
[2:45:22.440 --> 2:45:27.000]  any day can be our last broadcast spread the word about the show share the article share the videos
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:33.720]  and please fund us we'll get the great products at the same time at info wars store.com books

[2:45:46.360 --> 2:45:51.720]  and pray for freedom and pray for the children and pray for free speech and justice to win
[2:45:51.720 --> 2:45:55.880]  thank you so much for joining us i'll spread the word my friends we're involved in an epic
[2:45:55.880 --> 2:46:01.640]  historic battle people say alex jones crazy he's a conspiracy theory guy's a nutcase you got these
[2:46:01.640 --> 2:46:09.000]  rants and all that uh what they miss is that this guy's a head of the curve on so many different
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:17.400]  topics of signal not noise if you look at the signal and you compare that to pbs and npr and bbc
[2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:23.400]  and we'll do what alex jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there and
[2:46:23.400 --> 2:46:27.320]  if you're a sent in human being and just watching it you say well god alex jones is the head of
[2:46:27.320 --> 2:46:32.760]  this not only that he kind of explained it you are one of the great thinkers of this that is very
[2:46:32.760 --> 2:46:38.600]  rare you got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that in this new book i got to
[2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:43.240]  tell you when tony lion's first approached me i read this thing i go this is it this is no
[2:46:43.240 --> 2:46:46.840]  beetry you're not going to be flipping pages or you're going to be having a pin out and you're
[2:46:46.840 --> 2:46:54.280]  going to be underlying stuff the great reset by alex jones order your copy now at amazon or info
[2:46:54.280 --> 2:47:11.800]  war store dot com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:47:14.360 --> 2:47:19.880]  the powers that be used censorship and deep platforming to try to enslave humanity through
[2:47:19.880 --> 2:47:25.880]  engineered scarcity whether it's food scarcity energy scarcity information scarcity or technology
[2:47:25.880 --> 2:47:31.080]  scarcity and that's why it's so crucial that this platform info wars dot com continues to exist and
[2:47:31.080 --> 2:47:36.760]  that's why i support this platform and its existence and its hosts and the questioning
[2:47:36.760 --> 2:47:43.080]  of everything because where else are you going to get good solid information about how to prevent
[2:47:43.080 --> 2:47:48.280]  coveted or what questions we should be asking about these so-called vaccines or what we're
[2:47:48.280 --> 2:47:53.320]  talking about today low energy nuclear reactions major scientific breakthrough for humanity that
[2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:59.240]  is clean sustainable energy that can help power our economies for you know millennia to come if we
[2:47:59.240 --> 2:48:06.040]  if we don't kill ourselves first in nuclear war but this platform is so necessary to get that
[2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:10.520]  information out because all the other mainstream corporate media of course they're all controlled
[2:48:10.520 --> 2:48:15.400]  by the deep state controlled by the corporate interest controlled by the ccp in some cases
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:19.960]  you know the new york times it takes money from the communist party in china to run propaganda
[2:48:19.960 --> 2:48:25.720]  pieces disguised as news i think the washington post even did that as well it's it's truly insane
[2:48:25.720 --> 2:48:29.560]  to support this platform and one of the things you can do right now that's very effective and
[2:48:29.560 --> 2:48:35.960]  actually pretty cool it's a great idea alex jones new book the great reset as a fundraiser
[2:48:35.960 --> 2:48:42.200]  this book is available signed by alex himself i think it's a hundred dollars at info wars store
[2:48:42.200 --> 2:48:48.280]  dot com and this is going to be a collector's piece let me tell you a great reset and the war
[2:48:48.280 --> 2:48:54.520]  for the world by alex jones so if you go in there get a copy of that book it's going to be signed
[2:48:55.080 --> 2:49:00.120]  every signature is you know unique it's not like a machine signing it it's it's alex jones staying
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:07.400]  up late signing it and you'll be able to show this and and really treasure this because info wars
[2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:13.560]  is the platform that is saving humanity from the lies the propaganda the disinformation of the
[2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:20.120]  controlled media propagandists and the depopulation anti-human globalists so this is history of the
[2:49:20.120 --> 2:49:24.040]  making folks and that's why i'm having my guest on today this is the last segment with james
[2:49:24.040 --> 2:49:29.480]  martinez thank you james for your patience but it's almost difficult for us to accurately describe the
[2:49:30.040 --> 2:49:35.080]  monumental changes and that's my question to you now what's going to happen geopolitically in our
[2:49:35.080 --> 2:49:40.920]  world when this low-energy nuclear reaction technology or lennar le and r as you say when this
[2:49:40.920 --> 2:49:49.800]  becomes applied commercialized to replace natural gas for heat and maybe eventually start to replace
[2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:55.640]  coal or fuel rods and nuclear power plants i mean i know it's going to take a lot a lot of time but
[2:49:55.640 --> 2:50:01.800]  what does our world look like with those changes well those type of discussions have been in the
[2:50:01.800 --> 2:50:06.840]  planning pages for a very very long time and i just want to make sure for the record that i say this
[2:50:06.840 --> 2:50:14.760]  that on world water day in washington dc one of the panelists that is going to be heading up the
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:21.160]  committee on the environment and green technology and so forth as a woman by the name of phyllis young
[2:50:21.160 --> 2:50:29.640]  she's the senior elder of the Lakota sub tribe she has been the supporter of this technology for
[2:50:29.640 --> 2:50:35.960]  quite some time it's going to be mentioned in her talk regarding the relationship we have with water
[2:50:36.520 --> 2:50:43.640]  and not as just a a means for our own health but the spiritual applications and also
[2:50:45.320 --> 2:50:52.920]  how to unite the world under this new condition that we're in i mean we're in a totally different
[2:50:52.920 --> 2:50:58.440]  position now in the conversation should be altered entirely i want to make sure that people understand
[2:50:58.440 --> 2:51:06.520]  that some of the biggest companies in the world that you hate are involved they know that this
[2:51:06.520 --> 2:51:11.960]  changes the situation entirely because it's the great equalizer and this is going to be
[2:51:12.840 --> 2:51:17.080]  everything's going to be redesigned and people know this so there's been discussions with other
[2:51:17.080 --> 2:51:22.840]  countries i've discussed this with the swiss government in their city planning office about
[2:51:22.840 --> 2:51:27.640]  what this is going to do with construction what it's going to do with cost of living what it's
[2:51:27.640 --> 2:51:33.000]  going to do with business in general what it's going to do to the alteration of currency i've
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:39.480]  had people from the crypto world i've dealt with for years i warned everybody way way way in advance
[2:51:39.480 --> 2:51:44.920]  so that when this day would come when this device was put out before the public not in a lab
[2:51:46.120 --> 2:51:52.280]  that this great change was take place this is already started i mean most people do not think
[2:51:52.280 --> 2:51:59.640]  in terms of how technology alters human behavior and biological impact culturally and what that's
[2:51:59.640 --> 2:52:04.920]  going to do but for this particular matter this has got to be discussed early before it comes out
[2:52:04.920 --> 2:52:10.520]  and it should be put before all our elected employees all the responsible parties that govern
[2:52:10.520 --> 2:52:15.320]  our energy policies how do we make sure that this doesn't get monopolized by those evil
[2:52:15.320 --> 2:52:21.640]  corporations that currently control society i mean we you and i we're all about decentralization
[2:52:21.640 --> 2:52:28.200]  we'd love for the people of the world to have abundance whether it's abundant water energy
[2:52:28.200 --> 2:52:33.720]  fuel heat food everything but you just said something kind of scary that there's some evil
[2:52:33.720 --> 2:52:37.640]  corporations uh getting their hands into this and they have the money they have the power they
[2:52:37.640 --> 2:52:42.360]  can censor how do we make sure we don't become slaves under their control of this technology
[2:52:43.720 --> 2:52:50.280]  well some of them have gone through consciousness changes because this when you know it's reality
[2:52:50.280 --> 2:52:56.120]  and know its capability the conversation is quite different i had private conversations and i was
[2:52:56.120 --> 2:53:02.520]  there specifically at this event to talk to people face to face about their where their
[2:53:02.520 --> 2:53:09.560]  philosophy stands and some of these people have tremendous financial wealth tremendous and i was
[2:53:09.560 --> 2:53:15.160]  pleased to see that this moral compass is in the right the right place that's why i went to this
[2:53:15.160 --> 2:53:21.240]  event it's very important because we have a chance we have a second chance to the right thing for
[2:53:21.240 --> 2:53:26.840]  humanity here because you cannot be you cannot lecture the public and lecture the world about
[2:53:26.840 --> 2:53:31.640]  saving the planet if you don't provide a real solution and they could have saved the planet
[2:53:31.640 --> 2:53:37.320]  a long time ago a long time ago so none of that works and if you're not providing a solution and
[2:53:37.320 --> 2:53:43.400]  giving a direction for people to go that makes sense then what are you doing so their arguments
[2:53:43.400 --> 2:53:48.680]  and the things that they've asserted are meaningless they're meaningless they always have been well
[2:53:48.680 --> 2:53:51.800]  right i mean they're out the government's out there telling everybody to buy electric cars like
[2:53:51.800 --> 2:53:55.640]  that's going to solve the problem it doesn't solve any problem what's going to charge the cars
[2:53:56.520 --> 2:54:00.920]  you know and then the cars have no range i mean you tried to tow a trailer on an electric
[2:54:00.920 --> 2:54:07.000]  four to ev truck and you get about what 80 miles and you're done i hope your vacation is real close
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:13.400]  by because you're not getting very far i mean it's a joke and then there's not enough lithium mining
[2:54:13.400 --> 2:54:17.640]  and it's dirty mining even in the world to provide the batteries that would be needed if everybody
[2:54:17.640 --> 2:54:21.880]  goes out and buys an electric vehicle so you're right it's a joke they're not providing real solutions
[2:54:21.880 --> 2:54:27.720]  but even this solution that we're talking about today le and r this is going to take many many
[2:54:27.720 --> 2:54:34.840]  years to commercialize produce distribute support the kind of evolve the feature set evolve the
[2:54:34.840 --> 2:54:39.560]  amplification of the excess heat and so on and this is not an instant magical solution either
[2:54:41.560 --> 2:54:48.040]  well money drives things and if certain amounts of money are applied at certain pressure points
[2:54:48.040 --> 2:54:54.040]  this thing can be in the streets in two years a lot of discussions have taken place behind the
[2:54:54.040 --> 2:55:00.520]  scenes with huge companies about the amount of time it's going to take where this type of technology
[2:55:00.520 --> 2:55:08.840]  to be put first how it's to be applied partnerships with companies what it's going to do to markets
[2:55:08.840 --> 2:55:16.200]  and profits and what is profit under this that's a big philosophical question because the amount
[2:55:16.200 --> 2:55:22.120]  of energy this thing emits from this very small amount of water is profound people can run their
[2:55:22.120 --> 2:55:28.280]  houses for like 10 years for minimal costs and what is that going to do that's going to change
[2:55:28.280 --> 2:55:32.520]  everything and that's where the discussion should be right now most people are not even aware of that
[2:55:32.520 --> 2:55:37.560]  but i would i would just assert to everybody that they're they don't know about this to go
[2:55:37.560 --> 2:55:42.520]  look at the data do the research most of these people that are doing this they're how do they do
[2:55:42.520 --> 2:55:48.600]  that open about please come check us out where they find the data wrong give us like where do
[2:55:48.600 --> 2:55:55.080]  people go to look at this is her website is her presentation to uh they can go to brillo and energy
[2:55:55.080 --> 2:55:59.400]  they can go to a number of websites that are doing this they talk of a very open source
[2:56:00.280 --> 2:56:04.680]  but brillo and energy they've had people flying from all over the world all over the world have
[2:56:04.680 --> 2:56:11.080]  come in to see that and seen every step of of advancement that they've gone in there's going
[2:56:11.080 --> 2:56:19.720]  to be a a a podcast that is going to become public shortly it is going to go into the
[2:56:19.720 --> 2:56:24.680]  financial aspects of this from the people that actually deal with it which is me and another guy
[2:56:24.680 --> 2:56:30.040]  and you're going to get to hear what really is going on in the financial world and the negotiation
[2:56:30.040 --> 2:56:36.680]  world and the legal world and the patent world all of that stuff and what is really going on
[2:56:36.680 --> 2:56:41.320]  because people don't get to hear that and they do know but it's been going on for quite some time so
[2:56:41.320 --> 2:56:47.000]  that it is proceeding before i'm sorry to interrupt but we don't have much time left
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:52.600]  the only input to this system as i understand it is is heavy water i mean you correct me if i'm
[2:56:52.600 --> 2:56:58.760]  wrong and and it it only uses a microscopic amount of mass to be converted into excess heat i mean
[2:56:58.760 --> 2:57:06.840]  it's almost nothing it's imperceptible is that right or you're correct yes so so people would
[2:57:06.840 --> 2:57:12.680]  have to change out the heavy water once every decade or what how does it work yeah they'd have
[2:57:12.680 --> 2:57:19.640]  to change out the water all of that is uh been discussed behind the scenes people are this is
[2:57:19.640 --> 2:57:25.960]  this this is a great moment for humanity that's what people should recall from this i just suggest
[2:57:25.960 --> 2:57:31.160]  everybody just look at the data do your own research you will find out the truth okay thank you

[2:59:27.800 --> 2:59:32.920]  large set of planets who are going to be dividing up the courts of info wars in the bankruptcy

[2:59:45.800 --> 2:59:54.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:06.840 --> 3:00:11.880]  All right folks welcome back this is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show I'm Mike Adams your
[3:00:11.880 --> 3:00:16.920]  host and we're going to be interviewing David Devine coming up about food scarcity the engineered
[3:00:16.920 --> 3:00:23.080]  mass starvation and famine that's being wielded against humanity also we're monitoring the apparent
[3:00:23.080 --> 3:00:30.440]  live announcement by Attorney General Merrick Garland and he is being I think sort of forced to
[3:00:30.440 --> 3:00:37.480]  respond to accusations that DOJ and the FBI have become insanely weaponized against the American
[3:00:37.480 --> 3:00:42.840]  people and as soon as he goes live with that we are going to probably bring you a snippet of that
[3:00:42.840 --> 3:00:48.680]  live announcement and certainly comment on that as well so continue to stay tuned here to infowars.com
[3:00:48.680 --> 3:00:54.520]  or band.video and you won't miss anything that comes out of Merrick Garland's mouth that's for
[3:00:54.520 --> 3:01:02.120]  sure and my guess is that the FBI is now trying to play the victim because I believe that there was
[3:01:02.120 --> 3:01:07.880]  an armed person that was trying to enter an FBI office earlier this morning and hey for all we
[3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:13.960]  know the FBI sent one of their own people to do that because that's what they're best at doing is
[3:01:13.960 --> 3:01:20.440]  actually you know being provocateurs of these kinds of events so probably an FBI guy trying to
[3:01:20.440 --> 3:01:25.480]  raid the FBI office so that the FBI can play the victim and claim that they're not rating anybody
[3:01:25.480 --> 3:01:31.960]  it's it's just so insane so we're going to bring you that information as the news is breaking here
[3:01:31.960 --> 3:01:36.440]  and while we're waiting for Merrick Garland to speak we are going to talk about food scarcity
[3:01:37.400 --> 3:01:44.920]  and how you can survive or navigate this massive famine and starvation that is being thrust upon
[3:01:44.920 --> 3:01:51.000]  us and in fact that's the theme today is how the globalists are trying to depopulate planet earth
[3:01:51.560 --> 3:01:56.280]  through so many vectors including energy scarcity which is what we just talked about last hour with
[3:01:56.280 --> 3:02:03.160]  James Martinez but also of course food scarcity fertilizer scarcity and now they are at war with
[3:02:03.160 --> 3:02:09.320]  the table of elements and this is going to be a focus of my interview with David Devine for the
[3:02:09.320 --> 3:02:15.560]  next hour the table of elements noticed that at first the globalists were attacking carbon they
[3:02:15.560 --> 3:02:20.520]  said oh we're at war with carbon carbon is bad they said oh carbon dioxide is a pollutant that's
[3:02:20.520 --> 3:02:27.240]  what the EPA said that's nonsense carbon dioxide is actually food for plants it grows more crops it
[3:02:27.240 --> 3:02:33.240]  grows rainforest it grows flowers for pollinators like honey bees you know you would think that
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:39.000]  people on the left would love co2 it's the green molecule for planet earth but no they say it's
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:44.920]  a pollutant but their war on the table of elements is not limited to just carbon now as you've seen
[3:02:44.920 --> 3:02:50.600]  in the Netherlands they're at war with nitrogen oh suddenly nitrogen is bad too there's another
[3:02:50.600 --> 3:02:56.200]  element that's bad i mean what's next are they gonna say oxygen is bad for the planet well
[3:02:56.200 --> 3:03:02.040]  they kind of already done that with co2 the o2 is oxygen obviously they're gonna say water's bad
[3:03:02.040 --> 3:03:07.640]  oh hydrogen is bad next i mean give me a break we're just gonna start banning the table of
[3:03:07.640 --> 3:03:13.720]  elements well we're made of the table of elements in terms of our physical cells and molecules and
[3:03:13.720 --> 3:03:19.000]  atomic elements we are carbon based life forms obviously the fact as far as we know every life
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:25.080]  form in the universe is based on carbon as far as we know certainly here on earth the insects the
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:29.960]  animals the plants the trees the rainforest that we're all supposedly trying to save they're all
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:35.960]  made of carbon this is if there's a war on carbon it's a war on life and that's what it really is
[3:03:35.960 --> 3:03:44.120]  so a war on carbon is a demonic or satanic war against the creation of life represented by god and
[3:03:44.120 --> 3:03:50.120]  that's what this ultimately comes down to it's a war of evil versus good it's a war of the luciferians
[3:03:50.120 --> 3:03:56.200]  the destroyers which is you know the greenies and the governments and the depopulation pushers
[3:03:56.840 --> 3:04:05.160]  versus those of life who protect life who are pro-life who are asking god for protection
[3:04:05.160 --> 3:04:11.080]  who are pro-humanity pro-civilization pro-freedom pro-free speech pro-first amendment second
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:16.200]  amendment and so on that's what this is and so everything that we discuss here is just a different
[3:04:16.200 --> 3:04:23.800]  rendition of this epic war between pure evil and pure goodness or pure uh knowledge awareness
[3:04:23.800 --> 3:04:31.240]  awakening love life and info wars is on the side of humanity and god and life it's that simple
[3:04:31.240 --> 3:04:38.200]  and all of those who are trying to destroy info wars are aligned with satan they are luciferians
[3:04:38.200 --> 3:04:44.120]  they are child murderers they are blood thirsty demons that are trying to destroy humanity and
[3:04:44.120 --> 3:04:49.480]  claim planet earth for themselves so yeah this is an epic war we'll be right back with david
[3:04:49.480 --> 3:04:54.360]  dubai talking about food scarcity stay with us here on the alex jones show fourth hour
[3:04:54.360 --> 3:05:04.840]  the number one selling category in supplements worldwide is fat burners is weight loss formulas

[3:06:12.520 --> 3:06:23.240]  mike adams all right right now attorney general merit garland is addressing the nation in answering
[3:06:23.240 --> 3:06:28.040]  some questions some accusations about the doj and the fbi being weaponized against the american people
[3:06:28.040 --> 3:06:33.400]  we don't yet know what he's going to say probably something along the lines of uh claiming they're
[3:06:33.400 --> 3:06:38.760]  not the bad guys even though they clearly are but let's go to that just for a little bit and see
[3:06:38.760 --> 3:06:43.320]  what he's saying right now we'll come back with analysis and also our guests coming up can we go
[3:06:43.320 --> 3:06:49.080]  to that right now authorized by a federal court upon the required finding of probable cause
[3:06:50.120 --> 3:06:56.360]  the property receipt is a document that federal law requires law enforcement agents to leave with
[3:06:56.360 --> 3:07:02.920]  the property owner the department filed the motion to make public the warrant and receipt
[3:07:02.920 --> 3:07:07.320]  in light of the former president's public confirmation of the search the surrounding
[3:07:07.320 --> 3:07:15.560]  circumstances and the substantial public interest in this matter faithful adherence to the rule of
[3:07:15.560 --> 3:07:22.840]  law is the bedrock principle of the justice department and of our democracy upholding the
[3:07:22.840 --> 3:07:29.640]  rule okay i i got a kind of law evenly sorry faithful adherence to the rule of law this guy
[3:07:29.640 --> 3:07:35.640]  is going to lecture us about the rule of law are you kidding me the lawless doj the lawless fbi
[3:07:35.640 --> 3:07:41.080]  there's selective persecution and prosecution of anyone close to trump or conservatives or
[3:07:41.080 --> 3:07:45.720]  christian or pro second amendment groups this is this is outrageous americ garland doesn't
[3:07:45.720 --> 3:07:52.680]  represent the rule of law he represents lawless chaos he represents a despotic evil regime that
[3:07:52.680 --> 3:07:57.480]  was not even properly elected that stole their position of power and is wielding it as a weapon
[3:07:57.480 --> 3:08:02.120]  against the american people i you know look i'm sorry i can't sit here and watch that i don't know
[3:08:02.120 --> 3:08:08.040]  about all of you i can't watch that so look let's do this the producers here at info wars
[3:08:08.040 --> 3:08:13.080]  they're going to keep watching this if garland breaks some major piece of news that isn't just
[3:08:13.080 --> 3:08:18.040]  him reading some script and lying to us then we'll bring you that information is that sound
[3:08:18.040 --> 3:08:22.920]  fair uh until then let's get back to reality and talk about what's really going on but just
[3:08:22.920 --> 3:08:27.880]  just so you know americ garland is claiming that he's upholding the rule of law and that this was
[3:08:27.880 --> 3:08:32.760]  a proper search warrant well hey if that's the case where's the the raid on hillary clinton and
[3:08:32.760 --> 3:08:37.960]  all her emails where's the raid on brock obama's mansion and all the documents that he refused
[3:08:37.960 --> 3:08:42.520]  to give back where's uh what about the raid on hunter biden and joe biden because of everything
[3:08:42.520 --> 3:08:47.560]  that's on his laptop and we we could just go on and on uranium one the whole deal but of course
[3:08:47.560 --> 3:08:52.680]  you already knew that because you're well informed so we're just going to move on here and see if
[3:08:52.680 --> 3:08:59.240]  something comes out of that so shifting focus to the food scarcity topic today we know that they're
[3:08:59.240 --> 3:09:05.320]  trying to starve us out so yes the powers that be are wielding government as a weapon against
[3:09:05.320 --> 3:09:11.960]  humanity they're trying to commit genocide here in america and they have deliberately shut down
[3:09:11.960 --> 3:09:18.280]  the energy infrastructure transportation logistics affecting fertilizer food farming
[3:09:18.280 --> 3:09:23.560]  the supply chain of tractor parts and agricultural equipment and they're doing so while claiming
[3:09:23.560 --> 3:09:29.880]  there's no food inflation whatsoever while the news yesterday said eggs are up 47 percent
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:36.840]  but kamala and joe biden claimed that it's zero percent inflation for july well let's see zero
[3:09:36.840 --> 3:09:45.480]  versus 47 percent hmm that's a pretty big gap i think 47 percent that's inflation and 47 that's
[3:09:45.480 --> 3:09:52.200]  kind of like kamala's iq i think uh maybe joe biden's functional iq but nevertheless jokes aside
[3:09:52.200 --> 3:09:58.920]  let's get down to some serious issues here our guest today is david dubine adapt 2030 is his
[3:09:58.920 --> 3:10:03.880]  channel david thank you for joining me on such short notice it's an extraordinary day i i appreciate
[3:10:03.880 --> 3:10:07.880]  you coming on to talk about what's happening to all of us as genocide is being carried out against
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:17.000]  humanity yeah i appreciate you having me on and what we're seeing right now is a full distraction
[3:10:17.000 --> 3:10:24.120]  from the impending tidal wave of food unavailability food price rises arm security guards in your
[3:10:24.120 --> 3:10:30.440]  stores in the final implementation of a digital rationing card at the end of the year so if this
[3:10:30.440 --> 3:10:36.200]  is inbound there would be a lot of resistance against it but if the distraction factors 11 plus
[3:10:36.200 --> 3:10:42.920]  on the other side think about how much this has taken away from those looking at the grain shipments
[3:10:42.920 --> 3:10:49.400]  refused coming out of the Baltic sea you know these grain shipments coming out are being refused
[3:10:49.400 --> 3:10:54.760]  now either stolen grain or subpar grain that can't even be used for animal feed and they're trying to
[3:10:54.760 --> 3:10:58.840]  paint rosy pictures of all the exports are up and running don't worry about it everywhere you
[3:10:58.840 --> 3:11:03.400]  look the southern hemisphere the amount of ash down there that is going to dent greatly yields
[3:11:03.400 --> 3:11:08.440]  moving forward the world's hopeful that the southern hemisphere can produce enough to get us out of
[3:11:08.440 --> 3:11:13.080]  this conundrum but as it looks right now it's not going to happen the southern hemisphere is going to
[3:11:13.080 --> 3:11:20.440]  experience worse for the size or shortages because supply chains have not caught up and they're going
[3:11:20.440 --> 3:11:25.000]  into the planting season in another month and a half or so you got all the ash from the tonget
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:29.640]  eruption that's going to cool it has cooled temperatures data wise already provable and
[3:11:29.640 --> 3:11:33.560]  the pesticides and herbicides are going to be even tighter supply when we come to the southern
[3:11:33.560 --> 3:11:38.840]  hemisphere but they have a exponential factor of ash into a volcanic wintered light version
[3:11:39.400 --> 3:11:44.120]  happening right now that is not happening or occurring in the northern hemisphere so traders
[3:11:44.120 --> 3:11:48.200]  looking at the southern hemisphere you know this is going to be a frightening scenario when they
[3:11:48.200 --> 3:11:54.920]  realize planting time that the yields coming out are going to be so record low that there's no way
[3:11:54.920 --> 3:12:01.640]  to alleviate any shortages they're lecturing us about global warming what's actually happening
[3:12:01.640 --> 3:12:08.040]  is this ash is circulating blocking out the sun to some significant extent i mean it's not necessarily
[3:12:08.040 --> 3:12:11.880]  visible with the naked eye but in terms of actual solar radiation that's reaching the surface of
[3:12:11.880 --> 3:12:18.440]  the earth and being converted into plant energy via photosynthesis that actual number is diminished
[3:12:18.440 --> 3:12:23.320]  and you're saying that that's going to affect crop production and also temperatures in the southern
[3:12:23.320 --> 3:12:29.320]  hemisphere uh that's no one's even talking about that in mainstream media they're just pretending
[3:12:29.320 --> 3:12:34.680]  that warming is the problem look how hot it is you're saying the the opposite problem is going to
[3:12:34.680 --> 3:12:40.120]  we're going to face the opposite situation here in the coming months well it's already in play
[3:12:40.760 --> 3:12:44.520]  and that's the reason i could present some data because now there's data to fill in those
[3:12:44.520 --> 3:12:49.160]  gaps of what would have been based on a historical precedent when you have a large volcanic eruption
[3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:55.640]  of a vei 6 planet cools there's an enormous amount of news articles coming out saying no no no this
[3:12:55.640 --> 3:12:59.160]  time it's different it was water vapor because it was an oceanic eruption and this time it's going
[3:12:59.160 --> 3:13:04.120]  to warm the planet not cool so the last million years of data that you have that volcanic eruptions
[3:13:04.120 --> 3:13:08.920]  cool the planet i'm sorry it's different this time this is a special one don't believe that last
[3:13:08.920 --> 3:13:14.360]  million years of data just believe us and every event you're seeing on the extremes could be also
[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:18.920]  explained through magnetic field anomalies as the sun's stepping down or magnetic fields wandering
[3:13:18.920 --> 3:13:25.000]  northern and southern hemispheres and the magnetic wander all perturbing or making jet streams and
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:29.400]  cloud cells bunch on top of each other and go into different places again it's a distraction
[3:13:29.400 --> 3:13:34.280]  they're feeding you an excuse glove warm glove warm glove warming but when you talk about magnetic
[3:13:34.280 --> 3:13:40.040]  field intensity and things just so far out of our control it's a civilization cycle on a reset again
[3:13:40.040 --> 3:13:45.480]  governments are riding on top of this natural cycle you got to distract in order for it will work
[3:13:45.480 --> 3:13:50.680]  so the populace doesn't panic before you need them to panic and once the panic you're talking about
[3:13:50.680 --> 3:13:57.640]  a reaction solution a catastrophic food failure you mentioned a timeline the end of this year
[3:13:57.640 --> 3:14:03.080]  you mentioned uh digital food rationing cards would be implemented before the end of this
[3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:10.200]  year i believe you said that now now to me that that sounds even more concerning i mean i thought
[3:14:10.200 --> 3:14:16.120]  they're going to do it sometime next year but are you seeing like the incoming crop reports being so
[3:14:16.120 --> 3:14:21.320]  poor that there's going to be food uprisings and price controls and rationing before the end of this
[3:14:21.320 --> 3:14:27.240]  calendar year can you confirm that we'll have some numbers from yesterday three basis points down
[3:14:27.240 --> 3:14:33.800]  versus estimate on corn yield so far putting it at 170 million 172 million that's already down from
[3:14:33.800 --> 3:14:39.640]  even what the road even the dismal estimates at that were just oh it's going to shake the market
[3:14:39.640 --> 3:14:44.360]  and it's down three percent just in the first week so what's considered like the harvest
[3:14:44.360 --> 3:14:48.360]  report you know before they had crop tours where they were out looking at the wheat fields looking
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:53.800]  at the corn fields looking at the soy fields and those are reports that come in during the growth
[3:14:53.800 --> 3:14:58.760]  and maturation phase well now we're actually into the harvest reporting and every day and week that
[3:14:58.760 --> 3:15:04.520]  we move forward especially with wheat out of Kansas and other parts in central grow areas
[3:15:04.520 --> 3:15:11.320]  including parts of Texas drought drought drought and those bushels per acre are looking at 2025
[3:15:11.320 --> 3:15:18.600]  bushels per acre western Kansas when the average is 62 55 to 62 they're looking at really big losses
[3:15:18.600 --> 3:15:24.920]  across the way here in canada also said they're grain traders and had sold to the usda for over
[3:15:24.920 --> 3:15:30.200]  estimating 15 percent of what wheat yields would be out of canada and this is all coming in right
[3:15:30.200 --> 3:15:34.760]  out of the harvest season manipulation by the government to overstate production in order to
[3:15:34.760 --> 3:15:40.520]  try to drive down prices and make americans think there's not inflation but this is only going to
[3:15:40.520 --> 3:15:46.040]  backfire as soon as reality hits the supply chain here um look we'll talk about that on the other
[3:15:46.040 --> 3:15:50.280]  side we're going to break but folks stay with us we got david divine here about food scarcity we'll

[3:19:55.080 --> 3:20:03.160]  in an epic historic battle leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order it's alex
[3:20:03.160 --> 3:20:17.560]  jones all right attorney general mary garland has just given a live talk to the nation and kind of
[3:20:17.560 --> 3:20:24.280]  lecturing the nation he says that he personally approved the raid on trump's private residence
[3:20:24.280 --> 3:20:28.760]  course he doesn't call it a raid they're not allowed to use the term raid or recession seems
[3:20:28.760 --> 3:20:34.680]  like there's a ban on words that begin with r under the biden regime isn't that interesting no
[3:20:34.680 --> 3:20:40.520]  recession no raid i i i wonder what else uh will be banned coming up but you're not allowed to talk
[3:20:40.520 --> 3:20:45.240]  about a raid garland says he approved it so i just want to give a round of applause to merrick
[3:20:45.240 --> 3:20:52.920]  garland for helping trump get elected in 2024 and helping trump have his record fundraising
[3:20:52.920 --> 3:20:59.720]  a burst of activity following the raid on trump's private residence merrick garland who falsely
[3:20:59.720 --> 3:21:06.600]  claims to uphold the rule of law is really working almost hand in hand to get trump elected and to
[3:21:06.600 --> 3:21:13.000]  wake up the american people about the abuses of the rogue fbi which even now members of the u.s
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:20.040]  congress are saying should be completely defunded dismantled disbanded and if trump does into the
[3:21:20.040 --> 3:21:25.160]  white house in the next election if he runs he hasn't officially announced yet but if he runs if
[3:21:25.160 --> 3:21:31.720]  he gets elected he's promised to just gut the federal bureaucracy which is exactly what needs
[3:21:31.720 --> 3:21:36.440]  to happen and you've even got arizona governor candidate carrie lake who deserves your support
[3:21:36.440 --> 3:21:43.560]  by the way saying that it's time to essentially nullify the rogue federal agencies in the state
[3:21:43.560 --> 3:21:49.240]  of arizona she's absolutely correct about that now just shortly we're going to go to our guest
[3:21:49.240 --> 3:21:52.760]  david dubine thank you david for standing by but i got to bring in something else
[3:21:52.760 --> 3:22:00.760]  some shocking photos of the irs training their agents to shoot and kill americans these photos
[3:22:00.760 --> 3:22:07.880]  have come out in the 2021 annual report of the irs what's called a criminal investigations unit
[3:22:07.880 --> 3:22:14.200]  it's irs-ci you see these photos these are irs agents this is in the annual report there's a
[3:22:14.200 --> 3:22:22.200]  rifle team of irs agents planning to raid and shoot americans and then there's pistol training
[3:22:22.200 --> 3:22:26.440]  and you notice that they're using handguns against multiple targets those are the americans that
[3:22:26.440 --> 3:22:31.960]  they're planning on shooting and then of course as info wars has been covering for the last day or so
[3:22:31.960 --> 3:22:38.680]  the irs put out a health wanted ad that required new hires to be willing to use quote deadly force
[3:22:38.680 --> 3:22:43.800]  against the american people which is another way of saying they want to have employees who are
[3:22:43.800 --> 3:22:52.440]  willing to kill americans willing to fire upon americans and on top of this the irs just this year
[3:22:52.440 --> 3:22:57.080]  just between i believe it was february and may of this year they purchased seven hundred thousand
[3:22:57.080 --> 3:23:04.360]  dollars nearly in ammunition and that's something like five million rounds of am i forgot the exact
[3:23:04.360 --> 3:23:10.280]  round count it's many millions of rounds of ammunition including ar-15 ammo shotgun ammo
[3:23:10.280 --> 3:23:16.360]  nine millimeter pistol ammo and this is supposed to be for bean counters who tell you how much you
[3:23:16.360 --> 3:23:23.400]  owe uh the irs is building a private army that they admit is there to have people who are willing
[3:23:23.400 --> 3:23:30.840]  to kill americans and the fbi is running a selective persecution series of raids and arrests and
[3:23:30.840 --> 3:23:37.080]  confiscations only targeting conservatives while covering up the crimes of democrats while covering
[3:23:37.080 --> 3:23:42.040]  up hunter biden's laptop while protecting hillary clinton no matter what and we're supposed to
[3:23:42.040 --> 3:23:47.960]  believe from the doj that we're watching the rule of law no we're watching the rule of lawlessness
[3:23:48.600 --> 3:23:54.520]  the tyranny of lawlessness everybody sees it everybody sees it and frankly trump's standing
[3:23:54.520 --> 3:24:01.480]  is stronger than ever and we're seeing candidates like carol lake and members of congress who are
[3:24:01.480 --> 3:24:05.800]  now just standing up and saying enough is enough we've got to stop this tyranny we've got to take
[3:24:05.800 --> 3:24:11.240]  america back peacefully and nullify these rogue federal agencies that are completely out of control
[3:24:11.240 --> 3:24:17.400]  all right i just wanted you to see those shocking irs photos the irs is training to kill you they
[3:24:17.400 --> 3:24:21.800]  are that's i mean they admit it that's in their job listing their training to kill you okay going
[3:24:21.800 --> 3:24:27.400]  back to our food scarcity topic again we got david dubine joining us from adapt 2030 i want to thank
[3:24:27.400 --> 3:24:31.720]  you david for your patience there's a lot of breaking news happening today but you were just
[3:24:31.720 --> 3:24:39.080]  talking about the ramifications of this incredibly engineered food scarcity emergency and you believe
[3:24:39.080 --> 3:24:43.720]  that by the end of this year we're going to have a digital food rationing cards i'll go to you in just
[3:24:43.720 --> 3:24:50.360]  a second but i want to add james rickards just did an interview with kiyosaki where he talked about
[3:24:50.360 --> 3:24:56.600]  he even gave a date i think he said december 12 or december 13 of this year there would be a switch
[3:24:56.600 --> 3:25:00.760]  from the dollar and cash would be outlawed and they would bring people they would force everybody
[3:25:00.760 --> 3:25:06.200]  into the central bank digital currencies that aligns with what you just said david that you'll
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:11.240]  be in a digital wallet and they'll control what you're allowed to buy and where you're allowed
[3:25:11.240 --> 3:25:15.560]  to even spend your digital dollars it's a nightmare scenario your comments please
[3:25:17.640 --> 3:25:20.760]  well instead of taking our country back we need to take our planet back
[3:25:21.480 --> 3:25:26.360]  this fight between light and dark that exist in front of us all bear to see now it's about
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:32.360]  taking our full planet back not just a single country and different words are words that you
[3:25:32.360 --> 3:25:36.680]  were mentioning that are going to be for bolt and well rationing will be another one you can add
[3:25:36.680 --> 3:25:42.040]  another one there won't be rationing it'll be like well you're just limited to this particular amount
[3:25:42.040 --> 3:25:47.640]  of butter for this amount of time for your family and think about digital rationing cards it's so
[3:25:47.640 --> 3:25:54.120]  nefarious because in the old days a child could walk down with their family's ration card and get
[3:25:54.120 --> 3:25:59.480]  it from the store keeper but now they're going to be using digital facial recognition for you to
[3:25:59.480 --> 3:26:04.760]  unlock that card which means only the person who is validated to use that ration is allowed to use
[3:26:04.760 --> 3:26:10.680]  it but they have to go to the store and what happens if you're sick or you become invalid because
[3:26:10.680 --> 3:26:16.440]  whatever reasons how does that transfer to another to be able to utilize that it doesn't it's a one
[3:26:16.440 --> 3:26:23.160]  use for one person only and another thing that's really shocking for me is you know i will give
[3:26:23.160 --> 3:26:31.480]  you a way to re utilize the funds how about a Manhattan project for farm inputs for herbicides
[3:26:31.480 --> 3:26:36.840]  pesticides think i'm not a fan now don't get me wrong i'm not a fan of polluting our planet and
[3:26:36.840 --> 3:26:41.880]  doing agribus the way it is it does provide the yields we're going to switch eventually but the
[3:26:41.880 --> 3:26:47.800]  way it's done today we are so lacking in those inputs that it is going to affect the amount of
[3:26:47.800 --> 3:26:53.000]  food for production for ethanol for animal husbandry and what for human consumption foods
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:58.200]  are what about our own farmers can't we spend billions of dollars sending it over to waste in
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:27:02.040]  different nations when we could use that for subsidies for our farmers for our own diesel fuel
[3:27:02.680 --> 3:27:10.040]  on our own farms to provide food for the american people and then to export i mean is it too much
[3:27:10.040 --> 3:27:15.240]  to ask to pull back and then provide for at least the very base of a society the basic food
[3:27:15.240 --> 3:27:21.720]  stuffs to be manufactured grown and distributed in a nation so that we can remain strong is that
[3:27:21.720 --> 3:27:27.560]  a little too much to ask well it is too much to ask of this administration david to answer your
[3:27:27.560 --> 3:27:32.520]  question they're sending billions of dollars over to ukraine which is only resulting in more
[3:27:32.520 --> 3:27:37.480]  ukrainian young men innocent men dying because they're not properly trained on these weapons that
[3:27:37.480 --> 3:27:43.160]  the money is vanishing it's disappearing roughly only 30 percent of that money is even getting
[3:27:43.160 --> 3:27:48.280]  two weapons that are on the front lines but at the same time the regime will not fund protecting
[3:27:48.280 --> 3:27:54.600]  our border or enhancing our railroads or investing in like low energy nuclear reaction technology
[3:27:54.600 --> 3:28:01.160]  that can create energy abundance and so on you know it's it's so twisted it's obviously engineered

[3:33:00.760 --> 3:33:13.400]  new world order it's alex jones leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's
[3:33:13.400 --> 3:33:23.960]  alex jones with mike adams i forgot to mention when we were showing the photos of the irs agents
[3:33:23.960 --> 3:33:30.680]  training to kill americans that the irs is also impersonating police you notice that their shirts
[3:33:30.680 --> 3:33:38.760]  are emblazoned with police and then irs-ci that's irs criminal investigations the irs has no authority
[3:33:38.760 --> 3:33:46.200]  no constitutional authority whatsoever to be a private police force to run around with weapons
[3:33:46.200 --> 3:33:52.600]  of war as the democrats say on the streets of america to try to confiscate from people coerce
[3:33:52.600 --> 3:33:58.920]  people threaten people and yet the so-called inflation reduction act is going to now add
[3:33:58.920 --> 3:34:07.960]  87 000 irs agents that's a military-sized force and as we know confirmed this is not exaggeration
[3:34:08.520 --> 3:34:14.680]  some of those new hires are demanded to be willing to kill americans and that's what the irs is doing
[3:34:14.680 --> 3:34:22.440]  they are raising an army of armed enforcers of federal government tyranny that is a fact
[3:34:23.080 --> 3:34:27.480]  that is 100 confirmed by the irs itself in their jobless and there it is they have to be
[3:34:27.480 --> 3:34:32.680]  willing to carry a firearm be willing to use deadly force if necessary so so david divine
[3:34:32.680 --> 3:34:39.480]  your channels are adapt 2030 on youtube and other platforms so what you're seeing and i know you
[3:34:39.480 --> 3:34:43.640]  follow all this news although your focus is food but you know we're seeing that government is trying
[3:34:43.640 --> 3:34:48.920]  to commit genocide against the people of the world not just americans but all over the world
[3:34:48.920 --> 3:34:54.520]  food is one of those vectors so i asked you before the break what is america going to look like this
[3:34:54.520 --> 3:35:00.360]  coming december january and february as this food scarcity situation worsens go ahead sir
[3:35:02.120 --> 3:35:05.640]  i'm going to pull up this book here because we need a history book the great depression at diary
[3:35:06.520 --> 3:35:12.040]  they confiscated people's homes for as little as 87 dollars owed in federal taxes or land taxes
[3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:17.800]  at that time the green deal that we know now as the new green deal and the new deal that was put
[3:35:17.800 --> 3:35:23.080]  forth for public works projects to get people working again so you mentioned the new dollar
[3:35:23.080 --> 3:35:27.160]  well how would people accept that there'd still be a division of hey i want the old dollar and
[3:35:27.160 --> 3:35:31.800]  what happens with the new dollar well what they did was they started paying people in these public
[3:35:31.800 --> 3:35:37.480]  works projects the new money if you will the new what we understand now is just a printable dollar
[3:35:37.480 --> 3:35:44.120]  versus being backed by gold so shopkeepers had to start to accept it they went away from the physical
[3:35:44.120 --> 3:35:49.160]  coinage which was demanded earlier they paid everybody in the public works project in that
[3:35:49.160 --> 3:35:54.040]  new form of currency they didn't change the name though it went from a gold backed into just a
[3:35:54.040 --> 3:35:59.560]  printable paper which we know now print on demand fed notes and that was the whole key is getting it
[3:35:59.560 --> 3:36:05.000]  a general circulation through public's works project yeah the wpa and then once they had that
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:09.720]  then everybody else had a following line to accept it and that's how they got general acceptance
[3:36:09.720 --> 3:36:14.280]  to move forward you know i look at a lot of understanding these patterns and how they're
[3:36:14.280 --> 3:36:19.560]  going to implement new the new is the old there's nothing really new under the sun it's just a
[3:36:19.560 --> 3:36:25.160]  re uh reformulation of the old acts add you know your chemist you know add an extra molecule over
[3:36:25.160 --> 3:36:29.400]  here and call it something different but it's nearly the same we're going to see the same
[3:36:29.400 --> 3:36:34.440]  things happening now how does this go to food well if you're going to go to the digital then
[3:36:34.440 --> 3:36:40.920]  everything that will be bought they'll require you to use the new digital to buy the food food will
[3:36:40.920 --> 3:36:47.160]  be the weapon more the monetary instrument of value of trade to get you into the store or allow
[3:36:47.160 --> 3:36:53.160]  you to buy the food will the new be the new monetary weapon it'll be a hybrid this time of food and
[3:36:53.160 --> 3:36:58.200]  digital you know dollars or central bank digital issuance is that they're still going to go call
[3:36:58.200 --> 3:37:03.960]  the dollar it's just as different as a gold back note versus just printed paper with nothing behind
[3:37:03.960 --> 3:37:07.720]  it except the faith of the fed this time they're going to switch it they're still going to call
[3:37:07.720 --> 3:37:13.240]  it a digital dollar but i assure you it is something very very different not good becomes
[3:37:13.240 --> 3:37:18.920]  the leverage to force people into the digital currency system and once people accept the digital
[3:37:18.920 --> 3:37:24.040]  currency then they can be slowly starved of food by putting calorie limits because they're
[3:37:24.040 --> 3:37:28.840]  monitoring everything that you're buying like oh you've hit your 2000 calorie limit today or you've
[3:37:28.840 --> 3:37:35.080]  hit your uh 80 a week on gasoline limit you know once they control your digital currency they control
[3:37:35.080 --> 3:37:41.000]  everything and they can limit everything and they can tax you and find you automatically even without
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:46.920]  you participate they just deduct the money out of your digital wallet i mean are they going to be
[3:37:46.920 --> 3:37:51.320]  successful in your view of convincing people to go to this or are people going to be so desperate
[3:37:51.320 --> 3:37:56.440]  they're just going to say please give me any way to feed myself that's right what you just mentioned
[3:37:56.440 --> 3:38:00.360]  is probably step two or three down the way the first is going to have to be everybody getting
[3:38:00.360 --> 3:38:05.000]  them to accept it first now if you put that stipulation there that to buy food you have to
[3:38:05.000 --> 3:38:09.960]  use the new digital dollar and that will be the purchase mechanism for your food then the acceptance
[3:38:09.960 --> 3:38:13.880]  will be there and then a couple steps down the road months or a year later then they can start to
[3:38:13.880 --> 3:38:18.680]  quit those thumb screws on you and that make you comply but you know between here and there what's
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:24.760]  going to happen could they call force majeure on some corn deliveries and then they can limit the
[3:38:24.760 --> 3:38:29.800]  ethanol supply which would then degrade the fuel supply across america and there to be even less
[3:38:29.800 --> 3:38:33.880]  fuel but then it goes back and rolls into the basic food stuffs which allows a further market
[3:38:33.880 --> 3:38:38.760]  collapse to bring us into the digital issuance because they need something massive massive
[3:38:38.760 --> 3:38:43.880]  like we have never seen in history to bring in an entirely new system where everybody understands
[3:38:43.880 --> 3:38:49.000]  in a day or a week or a month unanimously that we have moved to a new system completely and
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:53.320]  there's no old system to go back to you don't question it don't ask we are at the new system
[3:38:53.320 --> 3:38:58.200]  only that's the only choice forward it's going to be happy that gargantuan of a collapse to get
[3:38:58.200 --> 3:39:03.000]  the ship for the public perception not only in america but globally for a settlement instrument
[3:39:03.720 --> 3:39:07.720]  because i don't see people walking with bags of gold across the border anywhere it's illegal to do
[3:39:07.720 --> 3:39:14.520]  that but protecting yourselves also means a new era a new era of food prohibition in other words
[3:39:15.080 --> 3:39:21.400]  criminalizing the buying and selling and trading of food using anything other than the required
[3:39:21.400 --> 3:39:26.760]  digital currency so they're going to have to criminalize you know local farmers is oh you're
[3:39:26.760 --> 3:39:32.040]  a potato smuggler now we saw you selling potatoes in the walmart parking lot you know that's a
[3:39:32.040 --> 3:39:36.760]  that's a crime now you're going to jail you potato smuggler um don't they have to mass
[3:39:36.760 --> 3:39:41.800]  criminalize all of the local food systems in order to enforce this nightmare scenario that you're
[3:39:41.800 --> 3:39:47.240]  describing you have to crimp it enough to cause the starvation and cause the panic to get you
[3:39:47.240 --> 3:39:51.400]  now at the beginning i really believe that you know knowing what the problem is going to be this
[3:39:51.400 --> 3:39:55.320]  is going to be a purposeful and you said it a bunch of times too it's a purposeful collapse
[3:39:55.320 --> 3:40:01.800]  a purposeful uh pulling back on the availability of food with a perception of shortages now when is
[3:40:01.800 --> 3:40:07.160]  it that they release the strategic food reserves across the united states i think we've got 1.5
[3:40:07.160 --> 3:40:11.560]  billion pounds of butter and this sort of thing it's a strategic food reserve when does that get
[3:40:11.560 --> 3:40:16.280]  released and who gets it but if you know all that's inbound then you should already be out there
[3:40:16.280 --> 3:40:21.880]  buying your farm tools because here if it gets to that point in december and the entire planet knows
[3:40:21.880 --> 3:40:26.840]  this is happening and all americans understand it you only have probably a couple million farm tools
[3:40:26.840 --> 3:40:31.880]  in america a couple million shovels a few million rakes and hoes but you're going to have 40 50
[3:40:31.880 --> 3:40:36.440]  million family households that want to get those same items so if there's 50 million households that
[3:40:36.440 --> 3:40:42.120]  wanted you got two million available shovels that means 48 million are going to go without and you're
[3:40:42.120 --> 3:40:47.560]  going to need everything you can and then you're going to need to a way to store it dehydrate it
[3:40:47.560 --> 3:40:55.000]  whatever way you want to preserve it for a future date or a later date for usage you know anything that
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:40:58.840]  you have for storeable foods and i know you've got the ranger buckets there anything that you can keep
[3:40:58.840 --> 3:41:04.600]  for long-term storeable foods in case you can't get to the supermarket you're gonna have to grow
[3:41:04.600 --> 3:41:08.920]  your own food so seeds are going to be coming incredibly valuable and then you know i've had
[3:41:08.920 --> 3:41:12.920]  the same discussion what about seeds are those going to be coming illegal as well because you
[3:41:12.920 --> 3:41:16.920]  know there are some places now where they're saying hey you use those chinese seeds now we need to
[3:41:16.920 --> 3:41:22.200]  backtrack those and then if you have the chinese marker in there it's like a dna marker in some of
[3:41:22.200 --> 3:41:26.600]  the vegetable seeds that came from china they're allowed legally to come and rip your gardens out
[3:41:26.600 --> 3:41:31.640]  and i do believe that's in minnesota they passed that law there are all kinds of seed restrictions
[3:41:31.640 --> 3:41:37.320]  state by state across america right now it's it's illegal even to ship many different types of
[3:41:37.320 --> 3:41:41.240]  seeds to many different states by the way uh so you're exactly right david i think they're just
[3:41:41.240 --> 3:41:45.880]  going to tighten the screws on that and then basically outlaw home gardening to the extent
[3:41:45.880 --> 3:41:49.480]  that they can get away with it so that means people are going to have to go to gorilla gardening
[3:41:49.480 --> 3:41:55.000]  which is kind of like a world war two tactic i mean i you know because because i used to live
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:42:01.320]  in taiwan i know people who are old enough to have grown gorilla gardens in taiwan under japanese
[3:42:01.320 --> 3:42:06.120]  occupation at that time and the only way they didn't starve to death was they had a little secret
[3:42:06.120 --> 3:42:12.200]  like sweet potato garden out behind the trees or whatever that kept them alive i know people like
[3:42:12.200 --> 3:42:16.280]  that i've heard those stories directly that's what's going to happen in america based on what
[3:42:16.280 --> 3:42:21.720]  you're describing and and the average person has no clue final thoughts on that point it's not what
[3:42:21.720 --> 3:42:25.320]  i'm describing it's what the general media is telling you but you need to connect those dots
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:30.440]  across the wider narrative you know they have to put it out there so you find dot number one
[3:42:30.440 --> 3:42:35.240]  and you see and then go back through history and this great depression was such a good blueprint
[3:42:35.240 --> 3:42:40.040]  of what is about to come and how control was gained over because you think in the 1930s how free and
[3:42:40.040 --> 3:42:45.640]  wild and wonderful and everybody was so generous and gentle and they confiscated homes for as little
[3:42:45.640 --> 3:42:50.120]  under a hundred dollars okay there was one more segment david stay with us for one more segment
[3:42:50.120 --> 3:42:54.040]  we'll be back got to go to a break more with david dubine on the other side of this segment stay with
[3:42:54.040 --> 3:43:02.440]  us so many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on the street and said super male
[3:43:02.440 --> 3:43:08.680]  vitality is incredible why does it work so well and the answer is very simple it takes from chinese
[3:43:08.680 --> 3:43:15.720]  medicine and other ancient traditions known herbal compounds that boost libido stamina and energy

[3:47:21.400 --> 3:47:27.160]  info wars dot com and band dot video i'm mike adams the founder of natural news dot com and
[3:47:27.160 --> 3:47:30.600]  here's a fascinating headline from the gateway punnett just came out here it is the gateway
[3:47:30.600 --> 3:47:37.160]  punnett dot com dirtbag alert a g garland threatens americans who attack quote integrity
[3:47:37.160 --> 3:47:43.320]  of the fbi really a laughable concept basically admits they got nothing in the raid so that's
[3:47:43.320 --> 3:47:48.600]  breaking news they got nothing in the raid nothing that they can use nothing criminal because
[3:47:48.600 --> 3:47:57.320]  trump did nothing wrong and it begs the question did trumps team actually bait the doj and the fbi
[3:47:57.320 --> 3:48:02.200]  into this raid and they fell for it because they were so hungry to try to get something on trump
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:09.160]  where they baited into this and they were suckered in and by the way we have confirmation that most
[3:48:09.160 --> 3:48:16.280]  of the security cameras in marlago were still running so there's video of the fbi conducting
[3:48:16.280 --> 3:48:21.080]  this illegal unconstitutional raid on trumps private residents how much you want to bet we're
[3:48:21.080 --> 3:48:26.280]  going to start to see some of that video coming out pretty soon we also learned that the fbi
[3:48:26.280 --> 3:48:32.200]  rifled through malania trumps lingerie collection you know like a bunch of perverts which of course
[3:48:32.200 --> 3:48:38.040]  is not surprising given what this regime stands for so uh this is what we're looking at now and i
[3:48:38.040 --> 3:48:43.320]  think trump just outplayed them yet again trump is now more popular than ever he has more support
[3:48:43.320 --> 3:48:50.040]  than ever he's got more fundraising than ever happening right now and america is beyond angry
[3:48:50.040 --> 3:48:54.440]  and that doesn't mean that anybody should take up arms against the fbi or anything crazy like that
[3:48:54.440 --> 3:49:01.800]  we got to do this peacefully but people are ready to defund dismantle remove from power these out of
[3:49:01.800 --> 3:49:07.800]  control loose cannon rogue agencies that have no constitutional authority whatsoever this is why we
[3:49:07.800 --> 3:49:13.720]  need to win elections get people like trump get america first candidates back in charge of this
[3:49:13.720 --> 3:49:21.400]  country and then gut the entire bureaucratic corrupt system just gut it gut them like a i mean
[3:49:21.400 --> 3:49:27.560]  financially speaking like uh like gotten a fish just reduce it 90 percent there goes your funding
[3:49:27.560 --> 3:49:33.400]  you know good luck go go chase that down the street anyway continuing now with uh david dubine of
[3:49:33.400 --> 3:49:38.680]  adapt 2030 talking about food scarcity david the situation that you're outlining and i want to
[3:49:38.680 --> 3:49:42.680]  encourage people to watch your videos and your analysis you got a lot more details in your your
[3:49:42.680 --> 3:49:49.640]  youtube videos and other platforms as well but the picture that you're painting is pretty dystopian
[3:49:49.640 --> 3:49:54.520]  it's it's a nightmare scenario for america and i agree with you if people don't have food and
[3:49:54.520 --> 3:49:58.040]  seeds and know how to grow food they're not going to make it through this what's going to happen in
[3:49:58.040 --> 3:50:03.640]  your view especially to those people who are in the cities who have a relatively little self-reliance
[3:50:04.200 --> 3:50:10.280]  if they don't have stored food what are they going to do that's a good question because at
[3:50:10.280 --> 3:50:15.480]  that point they have no choice there's no choice b at that point and speaking of an integrity check
[3:50:15.480 --> 3:50:21.480]  for agencies how about we ring in the usda for a minute there you know the usda's mission statement
[3:50:21.480 --> 3:50:27.400]  is to stabilize markets it's not to give you the truth about crop production crop yields or what
[3:50:28.120 --> 3:50:35.080]  carryover stocks are estimates are estimates it's to stabilize markets so as we look across how
[3:50:35.080 --> 3:50:41.080]  many lives are being told to prevent panic it'll be okay in the city sure it will i mean even if
[3:50:41.080 --> 3:50:47.480]  you had a large balcony could you grow enough food i do not think so even if it was automated
[3:50:48.200 --> 3:50:53.240]  and then what choice does that give you then you look back through chapters of history when
[3:50:53.240 --> 3:50:58.520]  cities were encircled or we could talk about the hole in the door where all of the crane was encircled
[3:50:59.720 --> 3:51:05.800]  and the wheat farmers were starved to death we could go back to pollin we can go to any city you
[3:51:05.800 --> 3:51:10.040]  want to crock we could talk about the ghettos we could talk about anywhere you want through history
[3:51:10.040 --> 3:51:15.480]  when they encircle the city you starve to death generally there's no other choice you either do
[3:51:15.480 --> 3:51:20.600]  what they say or you starve and they're going to let you die right there they won't care if they don't
[3:51:20.600 --> 3:51:26.600]  take you away first because you'll be a problem at that point you might incite others but the whole
[3:51:26.600 --> 3:51:30.840]  way around this is getting ready and understanding these problems are here and looking beyond what
[3:51:30.840 --> 3:51:35.480]  the news is feeding you especially with this corrupted climate science that we're seeing
[3:51:35.480 --> 3:51:41.240]  where temperatures stations are in parking lots and they're they're trying to weave together
[3:51:41.240 --> 3:51:47.080]  excuses for when you're seeing these extremes now like for just an example here over the i'm only
[3:51:47.080 --> 3:51:54.520]  talking nine days of news heaviest rains recorded hit buildings so hard in yemen they collapsed well
[3:51:54.520 --> 3:52:01.720]  that's a desert event ioto volcano in japan erupting for the first time after 1 000 years
[3:52:01.720 --> 3:52:09.640]  heaviest rain falls in soul in almost 200 years death valley a year's worth of rain in a day
[3:52:10.200 --> 3:52:16.600]  pakistan eight times the normal amount of rain and we saw what happened in kentucky now you've
[3:52:16.600 --> 3:52:25.080]  gone to has record rains and this just continues on and on these are the effects of what's happening
[3:52:25.080 --> 3:52:30.920]  with a decreasing magnetic field on our planet and if you know that magnetic field is going to
[3:52:30.920 --> 3:52:36.600]  continue to decrease further that these weather extremes are going to continue to amplify into
[3:52:36.600 --> 3:52:41.720]  the once in a 2000 year event every storm system coming through this is why the ancients were
[3:52:41.720 --> 3:52:49.320]  terrified of the skies and they built dolmens across the planet they're still these cycles and
[3:52:49.320 --> 3:52:58.200]  they've left them to the to us in legend lore and stories petroglyphs and i'm surprised we
[3:52:58.200 --> 3:53:02.440]  don't take a look at what had happened in the ancient times now it's provable that the magnetic
[3:53:02.440 --> 3:53:08.440]  fields in a wander state so the more these cloud cells are bunching up the more cosmic rays are
[3:53:08.440 --> 3:53:15.400]  creating new cloud layers from 18 000 to say 23 000 feet there's an entire new layer of cloud
[3:53:15.400 --> 3:53:21.160]  being built across the planet that's now looping and interplaying with what is traditionally our
[3:53:21.160 --> 3:53:27.480]  jet streams and cloud cells that go from zero degrees at the equator up to 30 north and 30 north
[3:53:27.480 --> 3:53:32.440]  60 north and then up to the arctic and the same would be for the southern hemisphere now there's
[3:53:32.440 --> 3:53:37.720]  an entirely new I gotta add to this cloud in there sorry sorry but I gotta add to this David
[3:53:37.720 --> 3:53:41.560]  on top of this remember they're doing carbon sequestration which means they're building
[3:53:41.560 --> 3:53:47.640]  these massive machines to suck co2 out of the atmosphere which is a form of terraforming folks
[3:53:47.640 --> 3:53:53.400]  this is beyond geoengineering this is altering the atmosphere of an entire planet this is terraforming
[3:53:53.400 --> 3:53:59.960]  they take out co2 add it to everything you just said David where there's a weather radicalization
[3:53:59.960 --> 3:54:07.080]  because of the weakening magnetic field or the magnetosphere around earth so more electromagnetic
[3:54:07.080 --> 3:54:13.080]  energy penetrates in certain areas in an unpredictable way by the way from the sun so you have more
[3:54:13.080 --> 3:54:18.600]  floods more droughts more radical weather more high winds perhaps more hurricanes and tornadoes on
[3:54:18.600 --> 3:54:25.880]  top of co2 coming down because they're sucking it out of the air and plants need co2 to function
[3:54:26.920 --> 3:54:33.720]  it's photosynthesis folks so crop failures are being engineered into the system on top of the
[3:54:33.720 --> 3:54:39.320]  natural uh shall we call it space and that's not really space weather I mean it's it's earth's
[3:54:39.320 --> 3:54:45.800]  magnetosphere but that's a natural event our crops are going to be devastated worldwide go ahead
[3:54:45.800 --> 3:54:52.440]  there if you look at the ryan river it's below shipping levels now where the river has gone so
[3:54:52.440 --> 3:54:57.880]  low and many rivers across france are impassable for any types of traffic yet they try to continue
[3:54:57.880 --> 3:55:01.080]  to tell us there's going to be record crop production coming out of germany and france
[3:55:01.080 --> 3:55:06.040]  in these same areas that are experiencing once in a 500 year drought so even what you're seeing now
[3:55:06.040 --> 3:55:12.040]  and then uh have a number for ukraine here only 20 of all arable farmland was planted this year
[3:55:12.040 --> 3:55:16.040]  so these hopeful stories of the ukraine is going to produce and all these exports coming out to
[3:55:16.040 --> 3:55:21.320]  offset shortages just don't make sense and then if I could add one more thing you know there's an
[3:55:21.320 --> 3:55:26.760]  inbound current flow from our sun and that's how we get you know the aurora borealis or you get the
[3:55:26.760 --> 3:55:33.960]  australis borealis which is the southern hemisphere uh lights southern lights there's outbound flows too
[3:55:33.960 --> 3:55:40.600]  if there's too much electricity in the crust and the the atmosphere and the crust are a different
[3:55:40.600 --> 3:55:45.480]  charge and they're overcharged our crust is going to release and when it does it comes out
[3:55:45.480 --> 3:55:50.760]  and actually those field mines in space but as it's coming out it's electrified and those clouds
[3:55:50.760 --> 3:55:56.280]  in that regional area are being affected with microclimate systems being more highly charged
[3:55:56.280 --> 3:56:03.160]  which would put more uh cloud particulates and more formation of heavier storms in certain
[3:56:03.160 --> 3:56:07.880]  locales and this is the outbound current flow is something to think about too and that generally
[3:56:07.880 --> 3:56:14.280]  happens uh 40 degrees north or south latitude is the heaviest outbound current flow the heaviest
[3:56:14.280 --> 3:56:20.920]  inflow is obviously going to be at the poles but it's a it's a dual directional uh current here
[3:56:20.920 --> 3:56:26.040]  it's not just one way so then when you start to map out where the outbound current flows are and you
[3:56:26.040 --> 3:56:30.040]  look at the crop production zones under those knowing that regional weather systems will be
[3:56:30.040 --> 3:56:35.000]  affected then you can start to see that it's a pattern and you can map it out and if you do do
[3:56:35.000 --> 3:56:41.480]  uh some GIS mapping or whatnot you can start to put pins on the dot and then you start to look for
[3:56:42.360 --> 3:56:47.400]  red sprites blue jets and these electrical events above thunderstorms that will show
[3:56:47.400 --> 3:56:52.440]  you there is indeed an intensified current outflow and then you start to go hmm a lot of
[3:56:52.440 --> 3:56:57.320]  crops are going to be lost there too so everywhere you look you do extremes on everything but a lot
[3:56:57.320 --> 3:57:04.600]  of it's electrically driven not co2 not co2 not you it's the sun and it's electrical and you
[3:57:04.600 --> 3:57:10.360]  can't tax that and that's a great summary david i try to deliver so push back against
[3:57:11.400 --> 3:57:15.800]  all right you've you've nailed it uh if people don't wake up now they never will mass starvation
[3:57:15.800 --> 3:57:20.840]  is coming across our planet people get prepared or you won't be able to make it through this and it
[3:57:20.840 --> 3:57:25.720]  means learning how to grow food and also having some food stockpiles as a buffer but you've got
[3:57:25.720 --> 3:57:31.320]  to be able to grow it david dubine i want to thank you for joining us today your channel is adapt 2030
