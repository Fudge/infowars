[00:00.000 --> 00:22.000]  Another world, another time, In the age of wonder, another world, another time,
[00:22.000 --> 00:32.000]  Slap the screen and look to the return of the crystal fact. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:32.000 --> 00:39.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting World Wide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:39.000 --> 00:50.000]  It's Thursday, February 16th, 2017. I'm Alex Jones, your host and you notice that if you're a TV viewer, the background is flamethrower,
[00:50.000 --> 00:59.000]  Radioactive Red. And that's because that's where our world's headed under globalism.
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.000]  You know, I saw quite a few news articles the last week saying that I and Donald Trump and a bunch of other people,
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.000]  like Colonel Shaffer, you name it, are useful idiots of Vladimir Putin. No, let me explain what we are.
[01:13.000 --> 01:21.000]  We're nationalists that want our country back and we don't want to be poor and be under the New World Order and watch families attacked all over the world
[01:21.000 --> 01:30.000]  and the family broken up and go under the technotronic technocracy that the New World Order publicly has put out in thousands of
[01:30.000 --> 01:43.000]  communities, papers, books, statements. And you may have a big giant group of people so dumbed down, they want to be slaves, they want to go along with this, but a large portion of the globe, of every color,
[01:43.000 --> 01:59.000]  of every region, of every religion, understands the existential total complete threat that is the declared war on humanity that is the New World Order.
[01:59.000 --> 02:07.000]  Before I even came in here and saw these articles this morning, I was going to come here and say, world government globalism is treason against humanity
[02:07.000 --> 02:17.000]  and is a war against the nation state and a war against the individual and a total corporate system of dominance of all life on earth, not just people.
[02:17.000 --> 02:27.000]  It is an attempt to become God, but all of us have to fall for you to be God, don't we globalist?
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  And then I looked at the news, Le Pen has come out.
[02:31.000 --> 02:40.000]  Turbo surging in the polls way ahead, even in their polls in France, 5, 10, 15 points ahead, that means she's 30 points ahead.
[02:40.000 --> 02:51.000]  The Islamists are burning cities everywhere and the media won't even say it. They got into central Paris burning cars within hundreds of yards of the Eiffel Tower.
[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  And what did Le Pen say? And I've been telling you for decades, when you start hearing this from world leaders, it's the beginning of the end of the New World Order.
[02:59.000 --> 03:07.000]  You have to call it what it is. Le Pen, the euro is a weapon used against EU nation states. The founders of it said that.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  Le Pen, we will leave the EU to restore sovereignty.
[03:11.000 --> 03:21.000]  The State Department under rebellion and other CIA operatives that are globalist minions are saying she's a Russian agent and trader.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  No, you are a globalist operative.
[03:24.000 --> 03:40.000]  Evan McMullen, who thought you would steal the electoral votes there in the state of Utah and that you and your little cult inside the CIA was going to dictate the future of this republic.
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  And now they're going into full bully mode everywhere.
[03:45.000 --> 03:56.000]  Facebook, Twitter, Google are all announcing that they're going to turn loose the hate, the calls for killing Trump, the censorship, then we'll only expand against libertarians and conservatives.
[03:56.000 --> 04:05.000]  They're trying to force you out of the fight in cyberspace to give up so they can create the illusion that they're about to overthrow Trump.
[04:05.000 --> 04:17.000]  But let me give you the good news. The American people have seen through it. And even in known cooked polls by Rasmussen and Gallup and others, Trump has surged.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  Yeah, how many win the election at like 40 points? It was way ahead of that. Always 15 ahead.
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.000]  He has surged to 50 and now 55 today.
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  What has all your bullying done? You've failed.
[04:30.000 --> 04:39.000]  All of you and your armies have scum. You failed and you're going to fail more. Oh, go ahead and kill Trump.
[04:39.000 --> 04:47.000]  You'll ensure our victory then. I hope you don't do it for Trump's sake, but you're never going to win now. You're identified.
[04:47.000 --> 04:56.000]  So they had a Facebook, Amazon, Zuckerberg, Google, all of you, you need to realize you failed and back off now before you push too far.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  And then it goes into a hot war and you end up in ashes.
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.000]  In a protest against Donald Trump's tight citizenship policy, a day without immigrants has been declared nationwide.
[05:05.000 --> 05:10.000]  Today, February 16, 2017 will go down in history as a day without immigrants.
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.000]  Look around you. Is that person an immigrant? Imagine if they were just gone.
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  But wait a second. This ideal or illustration doesn't make sense. President Trump is not deporting immigrants.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  In fact, I'm yet to see or hear any policy that deals directly with just immigrants.
[05:22.000 --> 05:31.000]  So are citizens of the U.S. that have immigrated here going to take off work in protest for those who want to skirt the legal process that they went through to be an immigrant?
[05:31.000 --> 05:39.000]  An interesting notion. Or will this just be a bunch of self-loathing white liberal college students and older women like usual in a desperate attempt to virtue signal against Trump?
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  Or will non-citizens show up and proudly announce that they work here illegally?
[05:43.000 --> 05:49.000]  The goal of this protest is to display how imperative immigrants are to society. Guess we will find that out real quick.
[05:49.000 --> 05:57.000]  Or we will see that people who immigrated here came here to work for a better life and have better things to do than protest a process that they followed.
[05:57.000 --> 06:21.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.

[07:00.000 --> 07:08.000]  This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[07:16.000 --> 07:25.000]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling.
[07:25.000 --> 07:31.000]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[07:31.000 --> 07:38.000]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.000]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.000]  You can go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action. That's privatepowergrid.com.
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.000]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX Energy Unit for free.

[08:01.000 --> 08:07.000]  Well, I was thumbing from Montgomery. I had my guitar on my back.
[08:07.000 --> 08:17.000]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac. He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[08:17.000 --> 08:22.000]  He said it's a long walk to Nashville. Would you like to ride?
[08:22.000 --> 08:30.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[08:30.000 --> 08:40.000]  He turned on the radio and them sad old songs coming out of them speakers was solid contragoal.
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.000]  Then I noticed a stranger was ghost white tear when he asked me for light.
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.000]  And I knew there was something strange about this ride.
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just kicked off the Thursday Global Broadcast.
[08:53.000 --> 09:01.000]  Already Thursday, the 16th day of February 2017, I am your host Alex Jones.
[09:01.000 --> 09:07.000]  And if you're a TV viewer, on a radio list, you'll notice we got the background is nuclear red-orange.
[09:07.000 --> 09:16.000]  Because that's where this world's headed under globalism with its system held bent on establishing a planetary corporate-controlled technocracy.
[09:16.000 --> 09:24.000]  That is completely anti-human. I've said this thousands of times in the last 15 years or so, in my 20 years on air,
[09:24.000 --> 09:32.000]  that if we ever just hammer the fact from the Council on Farm Relations, the Club of Rome, Bilderberg, Davos, their public statements
[09:32.000 --> 09:40.000]  about how they're going to establish a total world government, cut off resources, phase out populations, create animal human clones,
[09:40.000 --> 09:47.000]  merge with machines and become gods, that people say you're not going to make those decisions for us.
[09:47.000 --> 09:54.000]  Now today you see it in the mainstream news about animal human clones and gene splicing and gene editing.
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  And it's, oh, guess what? They're telling you it's been going on for decades. They're rolling everything out.
[09:59.000 --> 10:05.000]  Twitter's announcing, yeah, we're going to start censoring conservatives and libertarians and Trump supporters.
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  Twitter for two weeks won't let you see any positive comments for Trump. It's all negative.
[10:10.000 --> 10:16.000]  They're already controlling it and not letting his tweet get out to everybody. I mean, we're under mega assault.
[10:16.000 --> 10:23.000]  It's so naked. The bullying of the American people and others around the world is just over the top.
[10:23.000 --> 10:29.000]  And you know why I love dodgerport.com so much? Because it's not even posted articles, except when Drudge writes an article
[10:29.000 --> 10:37.000]  and puts out a news blurb, which might be like a couple times a week. It's just mainly government documents, video clips,
[10:37.000 --> 10:44.000]  mainstream news, but from the globalist perspective pushing tyranny, but he'll just put two or three links together
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.000]  showing how it's their agenda, and then he'll put another clip where they're denying it's happening.
[10:49.000 --> 10:55.000]  There is no global government. Trump's insane. Jones is insane. Bannon's insane. Drudge is insane.
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.000]  And then all these articles, world governments in crisis, the answer to everything is world government.
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  The answer is getting rid of families. You better merge with machines or be obsolete.
[11:04.000 --> 11:11.000]  Yeah, we're going to forcibly inoculate you. Don't listen to these crazies that say we're going to forcibly inoculate you.
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  And the president's not allowed to ever talk to the Russians and none of his staff or diplomats are.
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  Diplomats never talk to any foreign leaders, ever. On the phone or in person, it's illegal.
[11:21.000 --> 11:27.000]  And we've got secret recordings where Flynn lined up a phone call to the president-elect on December 15th.
[11:27.000 --> 11:37.000]  It's unbelievable. He said, I can't talk about sanctions, but the president says he wants to talk to you about them.
[11:37.000 --> 11:43.000]  It's like if somebody says, will you marry me? And you say, no. Then they say, oh, you said we're married.
[11:43.000 --> 11:54.000]  I mean, it's incredible. And they've got all these slimy, anti-American, globalist, collaborator, arrogant, Brennan supporters, CIA people on TV,
[11:54.000 --> 12:02.000]  saying Trump's a domestic enemy overthrowing. He's a Russian agent. I told you months ago they were going to beat the drum up to this.
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  It would have been too insane to say it months ago. They have to just by approximation.
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  It's a technique, enter it in, enter it in slowly and then just build it and build it and have congressional press conferences.
[12:14.000 --> 12:20.000]  Evan McMullen, what a shame to this country. Look at that wimpy little egghead.
[12:20.000 --> 12:28.000]  We're going to play him right now on CNN. He's on other channels saying that Trump's a domestic enemy.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  That's the quote. It's even worse than I was saying. A domestic enemy. I was saying domestic threat.
[12:33.000 --> 12:43.000]  Let's see. I tend to dial stuff back. This is the elected president of the United States, a capitalist, someone that wants a free market and to defend our borders
[12:43.000 --> 12:52.000]  and to cut our taxes and to sign an executive order saying you don't have to pay $5,000 or these penalties if you don't get Obamacare and you don't have to fill it out.
[12:52.000 --> 13:04.000]  They killed that and Congress made six Obamacare changes but won't make any for Trump because the enemy is the Republican establishment.
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  And they're the ones on TV and everywhere giving aid and comfort to the Democrats and Soros trying to overthrow Trump right now.
[13:09.000 --> 13:15.000]  And they mean business, ladies and gentlemen. They've mean business from day one.
[13:15.000 --> 13:24.000]  They've had a lot of people privately say, okay, Alex, you said they do all this and how did you know they do this exactly as they did it?
[13:24.000 --> 13:32.000]  Because quite frankly, even top policy wonks kind of study what other policy wonks are up to in little areas to be really on target in small specific areas.
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  I study it all and I watch the patterns.
[13:37.000 --> 13:50.000]  And I see how they do different rollouts and I know their playbook. And so I'm telling you, they're going to ignite riots all over the US, burning cities just like in France right now.
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  And they're going to keep saying it's all Trump's fault and bully and bully and bully and then implode the economy if they can.
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  The good news is there's some patriots in the stock market and just general investors, no business is open again.
[14:02.000 --> 14:11.000]  So it's surging even as the head of the Federal Reserve says it shouldn't be and that she wants to increase interest rates to kill that and Trump's removing her.
[14:11.000 --> 14:20.000]  And that's why they're flipping out the bankers. The bad bankers are getting thrown out and Trump's going to the establishment saying, give me bankers that'll follow orders.
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  I'll still let you guys be in charge, but you're not going to screw people anymore.
[14:24.000 --> 14:36.000]  He says there's a big old juicy cornucopia here. There's a big old Thanksgiving table here and I don't care if you're a poor black person or Hispanic American or a rich banker or whoever you are, we're going to start having an even playing field.
[14:36.000 --> 14:46.000]  He's announced and told the Federal Reserve, you start loaning money to the local banks and they better start loaning it close to zero percent to small businesses right now.
[14:46.000 --> 14:53.000]  You've had decades of sucking our tax money and giving yourself free money. You start giving it to them right now.
[14:53.000 --> 15:00.000]  I read the banking association reports. I cover them. Everything Trump's doing is what local banks have been calling for.
[15:00.000 --> 15:06.000]  You don't think Trump hadn't battled the banks his whole life and his daddy didn't battle them. You don't think he doesn't know their tricks better than they do.
[15:06.000 --> 15:15.000]  You don't think he doesn't want to break their parasitic backs. He's out for you. He's real and that's why they're so upset.
[15:15.000 --> 15:28.000]  Even in their own CIA garbage reports, they admit, Russia, you better watch it. Trump's for real and America's going to be so powerful, you're going to be absolutely overrun by it.
[15:28.000 --> 15:35.000]  They're like, you're globalist like us. You know, hey Putin, you got globalists in your offices and Trump's going to shut that down.
[15:35.000 --> 15:45.000]  That's the article the Kremlin's starting to worry about Trump because yeah, if America turns back on folks, nobody economically forget weapons can stand in our way.
[15:45.000 --> 15:57.000]  And they go on to admit that they say Trump's taking over the whole global system that we sucked out of America and that the globalists set up for themselves so the corporate guys can play God and ignore the people and tell us we can't have cars or medicine,
[15:57.000 --> 16:06.000]  but they can have, you know, giant thousand acre ranches in Hawaii and trillions of dollars at their disposal and jet helicopters and life extension.
[16:06.000 --> 16:13.000]  Listen, I'll quote Lewis Farrakhan of the elite. You're going to give us some of this dirt or we're going to burn this sucker down, but here's the difference.
[16:13.000 --> 16:23.000]  We're going to burn it down politically. You're trying to get all the dumbed down poor people, every race, color and creed to run around and burn stuff thinking because Trump's trying to get in the way of the goodies.
[16:23.000 --> 16:29.000]  Hillary was going to give you. Hillary only gives you enough goodies to have you on the hook like a fish.
[16:29.000 --> 16:36.000]  I'm skipping this break. Now, Drudge has it so laid out so perfectly. InfoWords has got some big stories too.
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  I've been asking folks for four or five days to do a story on this. You can see they're blocking his Twitter. They admit they're blocking it.
[16:41.000 --> 16:49.000]  No one's even covering it. I was at Paul's got an article coming out of their blocking Trump in positive comments and the public's feedback to Trump so they don't have communication with him.
[16:49.000 --> 16:57.000]  And so he doesn't see what the public's saying. And so the tens of millions that see his Twitter only see their globalist brainwashing next to his comments.
[16:57.000 --> 17:07.000]  And this is the whole model of how they censor right now. But let's look at some of these headlines. Trump approval rating pops to 55%.
[17:07.000 --> 17:18.000]  Up five points in just the last week and the very same poll and other polls show the same thing. And that's in skewed polls, which are shooting for demographics that are more Democrat liberal.
[17:18.000 --> 17:28.000]  Meanwhile, Jack Attack, Twitter CEO compares USA's mood to Arab Spring, talks about the preparation for the left to overthrow the government.
[17:28.000 --> 17:36.000]  Reddy's crackdowns on conservative speech. This is their announcements. It's already happening.
[17:36.000 --> 17:42.000]  You understand, ladies and gentlemen? I mean, this is so massive.
[17:42.000 --> 17:50.000]  Meanwhile, 60% of refugees since judge halted Trump order come from terror-prone countries.
[17:50.000 --> 18:06.000]  Christian University in Texas opens prayer room for Muslims. Congress crawl, tax cuts stall, Obamacare for all, winner slumber Republicans, passivity during first month of Trump.
[18:06.000 --> 18:14.000]  House passes six Obamacare repeals. When Obama was president, now nothing.
[18:14.000 --> 18:18.000]  The Republicans wrote the parts they want to screw everybody over and Trump didn't let them do that.
[18:18.000 --> 18:26.000]  That's why he said in his inaugural speech, this isn't about Republican or Democrat. This is about putting power back to you and sending wealth back to the area where it's produced.
[18:26.000 --> 18:32.000]  It's yours. We're not redistributing. We're letting you keep it. And we know you're the engine of prosperity.
[18:32.000 --> 18:42.000]  The Republicans have captured this country. They think they own it. They think they run it. They're the threat. They're the foreign multinational threat, not Russia on the verge of collapse.
[18:42.000 --> 18:50.000]  And they point at that. These enemies of the Republic. I mean, this guy is a literal enemy of the Republic.
[18:50.000 --> 19:00.000]  This Evan McMullen who tried to jackknife the entire election and tried to take over. I mean, look at this guy. They're always just total wimps.
[19:00.000 --> 19:09.000]  They're the guys that send off the soldiers to fight and die. These are the guys in covert action commanding men 20 times the person they are.
[19:09.000 --> 19:21.000]  But they're little sniveling rats. So they're the ones all put in charge. And it's little dipsticks like this and people like Brennan, that Wahhabis that converted to Islam and Saudi Arabia, literally.
[19:21.000 --> 19:31.000]  And it was a communist in college. This is the type of crap that they dredge up and tell us that we're not patriotic and I'm a useful idiot. Listen, dumbass.
[19:31.000 --> 19:40.000]  If Russia ever does anything to this country, I'm ready to go to war. I'm ready to go with war to you because you've been screwed it over. You are the domestic enemy scumbag.
[19:40.000 --> 19:46.000]  Look at that piece of crap. I can't believe Trump's putting up with your treason. I'm serious.
[19:46.000 --> 19:53.000]  Let me tell you something. The media is like, oh, Jones now loves the president and the federal government because he thinks he gets his way.
[19:53.000 --> 20:03.000]  This is one of the first American governments just in the executive we've had in a long time. I told you Trump's going to be 10 times Ronald Reagan. Everybody better watch out.
[20:03.000 --> 20:12.000]  Ronald Reagan doesn't hold a candle to what Trump's trying to do. And they shot him for what he was trying to do. And then they got control.
[20:12.000 --> 20:20.000]  And, you know, Dan rather pops in over Trump's speeches and says it's a spigot of lies. You're a spigot of lies. You shameful person.
[20:20.000 --> 20:25.000]  Texas is a shame right here in Austin, Texas. What a sack of crap.
[20:25.000 --> 20:31.000]  So let's continue, ladies and gentlemen, all these bullies think they can push us around all this stuff.
[20:31.000 --> 20:38.000]  They're the ones that have sold us out to NAFTA and GATT, the TPP, where a bunch of corporations take control of our government and it waves its rights.
[20:38.000 --> 20:52.000]  They tried to get Italy two months ago, or a month and a half ago, to vote to sign over its sovereignty completely and accept a EU military and disband the Italian military.
[20:52.000 --> 20:58.000]  See, if Hitler would have just had a trade deal and been all cutesy about it in Europe and oh, and by the way, you know, it's decade or so into it.
[20:58.000 --> 21:04.000]  Oh, let us put some troops in as we got our president in and then you just accept them coming in.
[21:04.000 --> 21:09.000]  This is treason. This is subterfuge. And people say, oh, well, he's got Goldman Sachs administration.
[21:09.000 --> 21:13.000]  It's Goldman Sachs running the takeover in these countries. It's Goldman Sachs the globalist.
[21:13.000 --> 21:19.000]  That's why he brought key Goldman Sachs people in. And then the media goes, oh, well, it's true Goldman Sachs came zeroed at Trump all the money to Hillary.
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  But why is Goldman Sachs stocks up? They want to control the market and siphon it off.
[21:24.000 --> 21:33.000]  They'd rather have it be smaller, but they dominate it. It surged for everybody so much that they've seen their profits go up 30 plus percent in the last few months as well.
[21:33.000 --> 21:38.000]  There's even articles where some Goldman Sachs people are like, maybe this plan of peace is good and prosperity.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  Maybe we just have trade and still we can have all the weapons we want to.
[21:42.000 --> 21:47.000]  And then maybe it's good to actually not make poor people poor and maybe free markets the way to go.
[21:47.000 --> 21:55.000]  It does work really good. Nobody wants globalism except a few very evil people on the top because it's anti-prosperity.
[21:55.000 --> 22:08.000]  It was sold as pro-prosperity and these people that get together in these confabs like Brennan that thinks he's God and tells the president you better watch your mouth close quote.
[22:08.000 --> 22:14.000]  They all get together and believe like some employee you've been away for a year and you come back and your employee thinks they own your company and run it.
[22:14.000 --> 22:21.000]  You're like, you're fired. Get your butt out of here. People flip out even in business and life and start thinking they're your boss.
[22:21.000 --> 22:31.000]  This out of control hijacked government is not your boss. And I know you know that because even in their skewed polls, internal polls, just like I told you before the election,
[22:31.000 --> 22:39.000]  internal polls have trumped at about 65% right now. Okay. You notice they've got 55 in the mainline polls. He's going up.
[22:39.000 --> 22:45.000]  So even in their skewed polls, they've got him going up and they are panicking because people are seeing through this.
[22:45.000 --> 22:51.000]  So you get this through your head, all of you that think you own this country and you run it.
[22:51.000 --> 22:55.000]  You sit around calling people fighting for the life of this nation, traders.
[22:55.000 --> 23:03.000]  And you sit around with no pedigree, no background, no allegiance to this nation. All of you have been caught like Brennan selling out the foreign powers.
[23:03.000 --> 23:10.000]  You are the enemies. You are the clear and present danger to this republic.
[23:10.000 --> 23:15.000]  You are using your term domestic enemies.
[23:15.000 --> 23:22.000]  There can't be one or the other. Who's the real domestic enemy? Is it little chicken head necks?
[23:22.000 --> 23:29.000]  It's a type they go for, a little wimp, a little potbelly.
[23:29.000 --> 23:42.000]  Look at him. Look at Hayden. Look at all of them. They all look like they came from the same daddy and the same mommy.
[23:42.000 --> 23:47.000]  What is it? Because you can't get honorable men to do this. You've got to get little nobodies.
[23:47.000 --> 23:54.000]  I don't mean people that are small, or webs on average. I'm saying it's a certain pasty, you know, no at all little creature.
[23:54.000 --> 24:03.000]  Let's put him next to Hayden. Can we do that? And then let's put Brennan up there as well. They're just all these creepy thugs allied with the big corporations in the media
[24:03.000 --> 24:11.000]  who still think they can beat America and beat the military and beat the patriots and the intelligence agencies that outnumber you.
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  I'm going to be conservative. 9 to 1.
[24:16.000 --> 24:27.000]  Again, you don't have any of the fighting men. People like you, anti-American globalists, there aren't any fighting men that you've got that support you.
[24:27.000 --> 24:34.000]  You may be able to hire mercenaries and hire people to do stuff, and then they go home and commit suicide a month later when they carry out your will.
[24:34.000 --> 24:41.000]  So you don't have many of them left, do you Hayden? Look at Hayden and then look at his son, his mini-me, his creature.
[24:41.000 --> 24:46.000]  They thought he'd overturn the whole election, and they thought they'd block everything else. Look at him.
[24:46.000 --> 24:50.000]  Let's go back to the other one, because he has them shoot it down from the jaw to make him look tougher.
[24:50.000 --> 24:58.000]  Gosho McMullen just on a straight-on shot like him, and it's one you were showing earlier, and it's literally the exact same shot.
[24:58.000 --> 25:03.000]  It's the same deal. They know better, and they're going to creep around, and they're going to control Stephen.
[25:03.000 --> 25:10.000]  They're going to go on CNN with a couple hundred thousand viewers, and then they're going to tell you how the whole world works.
[25:10.000 --> 25:22.000]  Because they put their little grubby hands together. These guys are just unbelievable egomaniacs who just think they own the country and are going along with globalism that is pure cancer.
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  So let's go to Evan McMullen. Donald Trump is a domestic enemy on the Communist News Channel.
[25:29.000 --> 25:38.000]  But the fact that we know so much because of these leaks and these sources from our reporting or the Washington Post or wherever else,
[25:38.000 --> 25:45.000]  your former CIA, why are they so leaky? What are their concerns?
[25:45.000 --> 25:54.000]  I'll tell you what their concerns are. Their concerns are that Donald Trump presents or poses a threat to the country because of what they see in terms of his relationship with Vladimir Putin
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.000]  and the relationship of his team to other Russian intelligence officers or to Russian intelligence officers.
[26:00.000 --> 26:09.000]  These people, our people, our US intelligence officers are deeply committed to our security. They risk their lives routinely for it overseas in war zones and otherwise.
[26:09.000 --> 26:16.000]  And they see something happening with our US president, and they have seen it playing out over time that truly concerns them.
[26:16.000 --> 26:28.000]  So while leaking is illegal, their first responsibility, the oath that they take when they first start their service, requires them to defend the Constitution from all enemies born in domestic.
[26:28.000 --> 26:36.000]  Listen, I'm all for transparency, and if something nefarious has been going on, it should be reported out and there should be ramifications.
[26:36.000 --> 26:44.000]  But to the president's point with these leaks, do you give him any leeway in saying that is correct, that there have been too many, too many leaks?
[26:44.000 --> 26:50.000]  Well, leaks are illegal. So he can make that complaint, and I think it does have a certain validity.
[26:50.000 --> 26:58.000]  But again, I think intelligence officers are caught between the oath that they take when they start their service, which says they'll defend the country.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  They'll defend the Constitution from domestic and foreign enemies.
[27:01.000 --> 27:08.000]  OK, so they see a risk here. They see a security threat coming from the White House. They're responding to that.
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  A security threat coming from the White House, a domestic enemy.
[27:13.000 --> 27:25.000]  So this guy didn't support WikiLeaks, though, that was U.S. intelligence showing pedophile garbage, foreign states, money, Hillary getting money from the Russians, talking about enslaving the public, talking about making a spore.
[27:25.000 --> 27:31.000]  Tens of thousands of pages of just vomitous evil, or even mainline liberals, had to turn against them.
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  And even the London Guardian said, oh my God, this woman's pure evil.
[27:34.000 --> 27:50.000]  And then you turn that around, though, and say that the electronic surveillance on the president-elect recording his national security adviser setting up phone calls for him to discuss things like sanctions, that that's espionage and we're Russian agents.
[27:50.000 --> 28:03.000]  I mean, this guy's declaring war on America. And again, these people sit there and they're so arrogant, they tell the president, you better watch your mouth.
[28:03.000 --> 28:08.000]  I think people like that need to watch their mouth. And what do you think?
[28:08.000 --> 28:18.000]  I mean, you guys need to understand, you're starting something that anybody with half a brain historically understands you will not win unless you just blow the planet up.
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.000]  And I guess you're so satanic and so spoiled, maybe that's what you'll try to do. The people will probably stop you doing that, too.
[28:25.000 --> 28:36.000]  So, I've never seen any of these guys that even looks like a man. And I ought to tell you something, because a real man cares about their family and justice and the truth.
[28:36.000 --> 28:52.000]  And these people aren't useful idiots of globalism. They're parasites, they're willing enemies of America and enemies of this republic, in my view and historical research, who are openly overthrowing it and signing us over to corporate global anti-human dictatorship
[28:52.000 --> 29:10.000]  that is working to destroy the nation state and the family. And now, from Russia, to Brazil, to France, to the United States, to England, all over the world, people are saying, we want families, we want true justice, we want Americana.
[29:10.000 --> 29:19.000]  And all Americana means is just a big expression of success and strength and honor and will and trailblazing and danger and everything that comes with it.
[29:19.000 --> 29:29.000]  But just, you want it, you got it, barbarian will. Not a bunch of little chicken necks. You will not lead us into the future, boy.
[29:29.000 --> 29:39.000]  You got a bunch of boys that want to mount America's head on the wall as some trophy while they sneak around. And as long as the giant sleeps, they win.
[29:39.000 --> 29:50.000]  And now they know the giant is awakening. Key quotes from LePen about the wars we're winning straight ahead.
[29:50.000 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.000 --> 30:10.000]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce. Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[30:10.000 --> 30:22.000]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important. What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[30:22.000 --> 30:25.000]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[30:25.000 --> 30:34.000]  And when it runs out, you start dying. We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[30:34.000 --> 30:39.000]  It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[30:39.000 --> 30:43.000]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[30:43.000 --> 30:48.000]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the product that I take.

[31:18.000 --> 31:26.000]  My joint pain has been reduced significantly. I have a lot of energy that I've never had before. My cravings for sweets are gone, and I'm rarely hungry.
[31:26.000 --> 31:32.000]  Even my cravings for foods like hamburgers and heavy carbohydrate meals are now gone. This is the only thing that's worked for me.
[31:32.000 --> 31:38.000]  I was seriously considering bariatric surgery, but that's out the window now. Thank you so much, synergistic nutrition.

[33:05.000 --> 33:18.000]  I got a correction to make. I said Evan McMullen running around saying Trump's a domestic enemy and should be overthrown basically. I said that our fight men are 10 times the men he is and they're actually 500 times, 1,000 times.
[33:18.000 --> 33:21.000]  Let's roll in with this beautiful music.
[33:21.000 --> 33:30.000]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:30.000 --> 33:39.000]  The globalists are pouring their full will out culturally through the propaganda but also spiritually and they're spoiling for a fight.
[33:39.000 --> 33:45.000]  They already got one. We already are kicking their ass all over the planet. Their world government's going to get torn into pieces.
[33:45.000 --> 33:53.000]  Humanity's already got too many threats ahead of it. We probably may not survive already even if we beat them. So they got to be dealt with now.
[33:53.000 --> 34:03.000]  All the cowards, all the scum, all the backstabbers, all the vampires, all the pedos, they got to be dealt with. That means there won't still be some creeping around.
[34:03.000 --> 34:09.000]  But they're not going to be running the show anymore.
[34:09.000 --> 34:25.000]  Oh man, you want to fight, you're going to get one. I want to lose my voice but I just want you to know.
[34:25.000 --> 34:33.000]  I just want to beat these people, don't you? I'm sick of them. I'm sick of them thinking they're better than everybody and having their way with us.
[34:33.000 --> 34:39.000]  Having their way with a lot of good hard work and people eat pieces of crap. Excuse me.
[34:39.000 --> 34:47.000]  Oh god almighty.
[34:47.000 --> 34:53.000]  Robert David Steele formerly with the CIA bestselling author, researcher, reviewer. He's going to be joining us.
[34:53.000 --> 34:59.000]  He's got big news on the pedophile roundup he wants to get into and why Flynn was taken out.
[34:59.000 --> 35:06.000]  And there is a big pedophile roundup going on around the country. I told you it was coming two months ago. You see it. They're rolling up the precursors, the Wrenfields right now.
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.000]  So that's the silent war against the globalists. That's why they're so pissed and so scared.
[35:11.000 --> 35:20.000]  And let's just get it all out in the open. Let's just crush them. They want to fight. Let's just give them what they want.
[35:20.000 --> 35:29.000]  I don't mean a physical one, but they're trying to bully everybody back into their houses and offline and, you know, just Trump supporters thinking everything's okay and go to sleep.
[35:29.000 --> 35:34.000]  And no, you need to be at city council meetings, county commissioner meetings when your congresspeople come into town.
[35:34.000 --> 35:41.000]  You need to be there educating and forming and be bold and be strong and be focused.
[35:41.000 --> 35:47.000]  Everybody always wanted to fight for the country and get it back from the New World Order. Well, this is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:47.000 --> 35:52.000]  This is what it looks like. You want it? A lot of people work tired to get us to this point.
[35:52.000 --> 36:01.000]  Let me tell you the good news, though. This is a guarantee. They've already lost. They're going to try to wreck a lot of stuff in the process.
[36:01.000 --> 36:07.000]  Again, if Hillary would have gotten in, it would have been even better, but that morally was wrong to do because you might have started a nuclear war.
[36:07.000 --> 36:13.000]  And that was on the slate. That's a demon. She was looking for thermal nuclear destruction.
[36:13.000 --> 36:21.000]  I pulled a photo of her from a few days ago with Bill. I mean, just evil incarnate. I mean, those people are creeperzoids.
[36:21.000 --> 36:31.000]  But it would have been better for the overall total defeat of them. Just let them come in, let them expand Obamacare, break the middle class, rob everybody,
[36:31.000 --> 36:38.000]  have the school, say families are bad, you know, teach five-year-olds how to give blow jobs. That's their openly teaching now how to be a tranny.
[36:38.000 --> 36:45.000]  And just let them have their way for a while. But you know what? We got to do the right thing. Just like Trump said, I could leave Obamacare in and have it really destroy the Democrats.
[36:45.000 --> 36:54.000]  But you know what? I'm going to fight and I'm going to repeal it. I'm going to change it because it's hurting business owners and independent people and it's bankrupting this country.
[36:54.000 --> 37:02.000]  And Paul Ryan said, the hell you are, bro. Bring in the Russian spy stuff.
[37:02.000 --> 37:09.000]  Boy, I got an Eddie Munster haircut and twinkly little eyes and I think I'm better than America and everybody else.
[37:09.000 --> 37:17.000]  I'm just like all these other traders and Eddie Haskell know it all psychopaths and I'm going to mount America's head on the wall because I meet with all the big corporate chiefs
[37:17.000 --> 37:27.000]  and we feel sure we can beat America and beat the world and beat the French and beat the Germans and beat the Russians and beat the Japanese and beat everybody.
[37:27.000 --> 37:37.000]  But the truth is everybody under him wants out of it and has been waiting for this moment. You're sitting on top of volcano that's only rumbling right now.
[37:37.000 --> 37:45.000]  If you had any spiritual connection or discernment, you'd know all that, but you don't because you chose the side of selling everybody out.
[37:45.000 --> 37:52.000]  So you can be in a mansion and drive a fancy car and be around a bunch of other fake mummies.
[37:52.000 --> 37:59.000]  None of that has any value. Zero.
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  I gotta get these clips. This is Le Pen.
[38:03.000 --> 38:17.000]  Her dad, a hero of World War II, when they came back in to take France back, a patriot, a nationalist, a guy involved with de Gaulle and people getting the sovereignty of France back and getting the nukes away from NATO that was going to just control France.
[38:17.000 --> 38:24.000]  People make fun of France all day. France has been through a lot. Half their male population died just in the Napoleonic Wars.
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  Now the French Revolution before that for a decade, I mean France got its back broken.
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  France wasn't losing war before it was one of the most warlike aggressive countries in the world.
[38:32.000 --> 38:39.000]  People just finally, they killed all the men basically and I'm not saying they're in some strong Frenchmen, but they all got killed out, folks.
[38:39.000 --> 38:51.000]  The only guys that head out under the barn were left. You got a battle with the French 200 years ago. It wasn't, 215 years ago, it wasn't fine.
[38:51.000 --> 38:58.000]  It's the French with the Norman that conquered England, but the whole issue here is that Le Pen is a great lady.
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  I know people that know her well. They really care.
[39:02.000 --> 39:12.000]  She is battling sorrow. She's leading grids for decades against him. She tried to stop the Islamic invasion and now Paris is on fire and other cities, six other cities are on fire.
[39:12.000 --> 39:18.000]  The heart of the city was on fire and the news won't say it's Islamic. Nowhere. It's Islamic.
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  They say we think it started with some black guy got beat up by police from Africa, whatever.
[39:22.000 --> 39:35.000]  And then they never show the evidence of that. It is a bunch of third world giant populations led by the Islamists being directed by social media. They're allowed to organize on everything to somehow bully France into a further open border.
[39:35.000 --> 39:42.000]  And you go, that would get Le Pen elected. Well, no, no, no, they think they're just going to arrest her or steal the election and block her and they're going to just continue to flood France.
[39:42.000 --> 39:56.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, their tourism is down over 50% in one year, over 80% in the last five. It's gone because you go to Paris. There is feces all over the ground in the nicest areas and just wandering people everywhere.
[39:56.000 --> 40:08.000]  And the roads all over France are in a disaster zone with people running up out of the woods with hatchets if you stop at a sign in the woods and just raping you and your family and robbing you of your vehicle.
[40:08.000 --> 40:16.000]  And it's all covered up except by people on YouTube that catch it on tape.
[40:16.000 --> 40:23.000]  And this is what's been done. And it's again, the globalists have expanded the third world, destroyed it, dumbed it down.
[40:23.000 --> 40:32.000]  Then they have a gangster hip hop culture that is overlaid. I don't care if it's Appalachian whites or North African blacks, you listen to this stuff, you get into it.
[40:32.000 --> 40:45.000]  It's thug culture and then it just explodes and it's designed to bring everything down to create global turmoil so then a global military can come in and mop it up after the collapse that they're only beta testing right now.
[40:45.000 --> 40:55.000]  And I've been telling you this for close to 20 years because I had sources inside the Pentagon that were reporting it to me and even locals as well that were beta testing this.
[40:55.000 --> 41:05.000]  And they'd always say, oh, Joan says it's coming now. No, I said it's coming later. And I made films on it. And now the military comes out, he impress releases videos and announcements and says, we're going to have to occupy every city on Earth.
[41:05.000 --> 41:13.000]  The United States is going to fall and society's broken. We've been told. And people go, oh, see the military's evil. No, they're being given the job of cleaning up with the globalists or engineering.
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.000]  You'll be begging when your city's burning for the military to come in.
[41:19.000 --> 41:25.000]  So again, the news will say I'm saying the military's coming to kill us. No, that's not what I said.
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.000]  Coming soon with senior you, the US military plan to take over America permanently.
[41:31.000 --> 41:37.000]  And Trump knows about this and Mattis knows about this and they all don't want to do that.
[41:37.000 --> 41:47.000]  They like happy folks and farmers and industry and life and mom and apple pie and that's the plan. They're trying to kill the plan.
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  It's not that they're even perfect, but I mean, they're not pure evil.
[41:51.000 --> 41:59.000]  They don't want just some horrible over the top system where the globalists are so arrogant, they've admitted their whole plan to everybody.
[41:59.000 --> 42:07.000]  That's what's crazy. You'll never force feed anybody this. I don't care if you shut the web off or shut us off.
[42:07.000 --> 42:14.000]  That'll make what we've said even more valuable in people's minds and hearts.
[42:14.000 --> 42:24.000]  They're making the same mistake tyrants always make because there's something about the type of brain.
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.000]  They can get sucked into a tyrants type mindset.
[42:30.000 --> 42:39.000]  It's just they just feed on the power trip and feed on it and just feel invincible and are just high on just the spirit of domination.
[42:39.000 --> 42:52.000]  And you notice it's always weird demonic hunchback creatures like Hillary or Bill or, you know, this Evan McMullen guy and all these people because a normal person is so confident and so nice and so good.
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.000]  I mean, the meanest guys I've ever known in my life are the sweetest, nicest people you could ever imagine.
[42:58.000 --> 43:05.000]  They'll do anything for you and they care about you so much until you do something to them and then they will rip your head directly off your shoulders.
[43:05.000 --> 43:15.000]  And the problem is in this modern world, the men are busy and distracted just taking care of their families while their families are being taken away from them by the globalists and the culture and all of it.
[43:15.000 --> 43:23.000]  And we just have to understand that we're not declaring war on them. They declared war on us.
[43:23.000 --> 43:31.000]  And they're going to find out that we know what they've done.
[43:31.000 --> 43:43.000]  And we're not going to sit here while they go on CNN and have CIA operatives that have run whole operations to try to run a domestic operation against the president of the United States.
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.000]  That is completely and totally illegal.
[43:46.000 --> 43:52.000]  But I told people months ago they're planning on killing Trump. They're planning on saying he's a Russian agent and coming out and saying he's a Russian agent.
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  And when they do, they're getting ready to assassinate him.
[43:54.000 --> 44:04.000]  And President Trump, you know, guys, if you guys pull up, they're planning to kill Trump, Alex Jones, or the reports that I mean, we've written articles that have been countless videos in the last two months.
[44:04.000 --> 44:12.000]  But it goes back two months ago where I did all these reports and I said they are preparing, I mean, just type in CIA is preparing to kill President Trump.
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.000]  It was even picked up by newspapers. I just clicked news.
[44:15.000 --> 44:24.000]  And you can see where I said it's a threat continuum where they keep building it up saying, oh, there's some Russians involved, oh, there's some Russians inside, there's some Russians in the White House.
[44:24.000 --> 44:25.000]  Oh, you know, Trump knew about it.
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  Trump's a Russian agent.
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  It was in the evening standard in England.
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  It was in the Associated Press here in the United States.
[44:33.000 --> 44:36.000]  Russian insiders fear Washington establishment will assassinate Trump.
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  Yeah, that's from that's from this week.
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  This is from this is from you can click news and get it.
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  You just type in warning elite will try to kill Trump.
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.000]  Yeah, that's not it.
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  You know, I'll find it during the break.
[44:48.000 --> 44:49.000]  It's all right.
[44:49.000 --> 44:55.000]  It was my maximum emergency for two months, maximum of the crew, maximum of the reporters, maximum.
[44:55.000 --> 45:08.000]  But just absolutely every day hammering articles, videos, everywhere where I explained and even newspapers picked it up where I said.
[45:08.000 --> 45:16.000]  The elite are planning to kill Trump by pushing this Russian narrative by selling it to different groups inside the intelligence agencies.
[45:16.000 --> 45:21.000]  It's OK to kill the president because he's really a Russian agent and that they'll try to run this operation saying he's a domestic enemy.
[45:21.000 --> 45:26.000]  And I use those terms and I said they'd use COG to try to bring down the president.
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  We'll get him during the break.
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  But right now let's go ahead and go to this.
[45:31.000 --> 45:43.000]  Le Pen is on course to be France's next president fund manager says from AI analysis and the same big analysis groups said Trump is going to win.
[45:43.000 --> 45:47.000]  See, the real analytics with computers and mass move, but you know what's going to happen.
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  That's why I was telling you Trump was 10 15 20 points ahead, depending on the state.
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.000]  That's why they were so panicked and freaking out and saying he's going to lose going to lose.
[45:54.000 --> 45:55.000]  He's evil.
[45:55.000 --> 45:56.000]  He's killing, killing, killing, killing.
[45:56.000 --> 46:02.000]  Well, he's going to lose. Why are you saying killing, killing, killing because they knew.
[46:02.000 --> 46:03.000]  I'm going to try to search this.
[46:03.000 --> 46:04.000]  It's not a big deal, but I have this.
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.000]  I'm not really OCD, but just about stuff like this.
[46:07.000 --> 46:10.000]  I am.
[46:10.000 --> 46:11.000]  There it is.
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.000]  I mean, because this is just absolutely essential that we get to this.
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  I mean, it's you know, you got to click news is the issue.
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  So you guys put I'm telling you.
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.000]  OK.
[46:23.000 --> 46:30.000]  Now you type into that CIA plan to kill Trump in full wars.com CIA plan to kill Trump.
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.000]  Yeah, that's that's the search.
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  That's how you're going to find it.
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  Scroll down.
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  There it is.
[46:40.000 --> 46:45.000]  Oh, there's a spectator saying, well, they kill him on the CIA Austin.
[46:45.000 --> 46:46.000]  There you go.
[46:46.000 --> 46:49.000]  CIA and Obama plotting to murder Donald Trump.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  That's it.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  But there's a bunch of them and I did reports.
[46:54.000 --> 46:59.000]  So important to shut the show down until I have it because because I did emergency
[46:59.000 --> 47:00.000]  reports up here.
[47:00.000 --> 47:05.000]  I did everything and I and I laid out the whole continuum because the public needs
[47:05.000 --> 47:09.000]  to see this where I laid out the entire continuum starting two months ago, how
[47:09.000 --> 47:11.000]  they would build it up and get you ready.
[47:11.000 --> 47:14.000]  Because at first it'd be asinine stays a Russian agent with no proof and they would
[47:14.000 --> 47:17.000]  just create this whole cloud and then call for impeachment and call for his
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  overthrow and call for his murder.
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.000]  And then when you heard the CIA people come out and start saying it, then you knew
[47:23.000 --> 47:25.000]  that they were seriously thinking about killing him.
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  It's the evening standard has the video.
[47:27.000 --> 47:35.000]  The London evening standard.
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  Will the CIA assassinate Trump?
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  Ron Paul warns a more powerful shadow government.
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  Yeah, that was about a week after I did it or two weeks after I did it.
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  Alex shows emergency measures to President Trump.
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  Let's let's see that video.
[47:47.000 --> 47:48.000]  Everything is now turned over to this.
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  In fact, with all the reporters, everybody else, because I've been wanting for four
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.000]  or five days just to talk about how they're censoring his Twitter feed.
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.000]  And these are the key things.
[47:55.000 --> 48:02.000]  This is how we'll defeat them by focusing on the keys.
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  Let's go ahead and go to the little pen club here, this.
[48:04.000 --> 48:10.000]  Investors in the financial markets are nervous about you because you want to return France.
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  Yeah, sovereignty's bad.
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  Why?
[48:14.000 --> 48:22.000]  For a very simple reason, in reality, we are in control of our own country.
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.000]  So long as we have our own currency, money is one of the elements of sovereignty.
[48:27.000 --> 48:32.000]  If you don't have your own currency, you allow others to impose on your economic policies,
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.000]  your immigration policies, your social policies.
[48:35.000 --> 48:41.000]  The political austerity that is imposed today by the European Union is founded on the euro.
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  We are free people. We fought for this.
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  You too fought to be a free people.
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  It was not so that today we could give it all away to technocrats that we have not elected
[48:51.000 --> 48:54.000]  who decided for us which policies we should adopt.
[48:54.000 --> 49:00.000]  And I don't want to accept the euro, which is no longer a currency in the spirit of the European Union,
[49:00.000 --> 49:06.000]  but is in reality a weapon that it sticks in our sides to force us to go where they please.
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  The euro is a failure.
[49:08.000 --> 49:11.000]  It's an economic failure. It's a social failure.
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  It's one of the reasons for which France has seen such a high rate of unemployment,
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.000]  for which France has become so much poorer, for which our industry has failed,
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  for which we are confronted with an unfair international rivalry.
[49:24.000 --> 49:30.000]  There is no reason for us not to return to our own national currency.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  All right, then let's go to the other clip.
[49:32.000 --> 49:38.000]  So this is, again, LePen, who is surging and set to win the election unless they kill or cover it up.
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  And our State Department says we're going to help block her from winning because she's pro-Trump,
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  showing you how the State Department is still just completely out of control in open rebellion.
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.000]  But none of those crimes matter because, you know, a few traders in the government say
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.000]  Trump's National Security Advisor said, yeah, we'll set you up with the president talking about sanctions.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  That's what you do. They admit that's what you do.
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  But oh, this is, he's a big threat now.
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.000]  So LePen, the euro is a weapon used against EU nations.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  LePen, we will leave the EU to restore sovereignty.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  We're going to come back with that after the break.
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  And look, if I get upset on air folks and frustrated, it's not with the crew.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  I mean, this is just incredibly epic times.
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.000]  It's so over the top and everybody knows it's effective to show people your predictions word for word,
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  but we can never find them ever, maybe one out of 5,000.
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  I mean, every listener heard it freaking 500 times.
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  Warning, you know, that might be it. Elite will try to kill Trump.
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  Trump is in danger if he continues to take on the entire establishment.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  What date is that?
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  That's November 11th right after the deal. Yeah, but it came about a week after that.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  See, the newspapers picked it up.
[50:40.000 --> 50:47.000]  That's what's getting me angry here is that we've got Alex Jones, CIA planning to kill Trump.
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  British newspapers picked it up, so did US newspapers.
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  I understand there's thousands of them reporting on the stuff, but, you know, we're going to find it.
[50:54.000 --> 50:57.000]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[51:24.000 --> 51:29.000]  I bought a 95-year-old German blade factory and they started selling high-quality razors online
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  with no upcharging direct to customers.
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.000]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[51:36.000 --> 52:00.000]  Don't worry, Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to get all guys a great shave at a great price.
[52:00.000 --> 52:06.000]  Hi there, Dick Holgeier here. I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[52:06.000 --> 52:10.000]  I normally never do commercial endorsements.
[52:10.000 --> 52:17.000]  I am very skeptical of health supplements, but a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One,
[52:17.000 --> 52:21.000]  so I purchased a bottle and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now.
[52:21.000 --> 52:27.000]  I very much dislike so-called energy boosters, those little energy drinks that have caffeine
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  and Gerana and other things that make your heart race.
[52:30.000 --> 52:35.000]  This is not that. My experience with Synergy One has been great.
[52:35.000 --> 52:42.000]  My mood is better, my joints feel better, I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity.
[52:42.000 --> 52:47.000]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more, so I recommend Synergy One.
[52:47.000 --> 52:51.000]  It's really good stuff. I'm having great results with it.
[52:51.000 --> 52:59.000]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com. That's One World, W-H-E-Y.com.

[53:59.000 --> 54:19.000]  I got so upset earlier, I didn't get to all the Le Pen quotes. Here it is.
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.000]  Reality of Le Pen is a shock to the establishment. We just played that.
[54:23.000 --> 54:26.000]  Number two, Le Pen, the euro is a weapon used against EU nation states.
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.000]  Number three, Le Pen, France will leave the EU to restore sovereignty.
[54:30.000 --> 54:34.000]  I want to play more of that. This is really good news. This is really positive.
[54:34.000 --> 54:41.000]  I get frustrated because it's not the crew. There are so many hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles that have come out now.
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  Just since I first predicted it saying the CIA needs to kill Trump, he's a Russian agent,
[54:46.000 --> 54:51.000]  I told everybody they're building up to that to say he's a Russian agent, time to kill him.
[54:51.000 --> 54:59.000]  What I was getting upset about of your radio listener is while they were putting all of that up on the screen,
[54:59.000 --> 55:05.000]  as they were search engineering, as I was reading it, it was mainstream news saying the CIA needs to kill Trump.
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  So they've now gone further than I even thought.
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.000]  They've gone from all there might be a few Russians that got involved, might have been hacked,
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  to all the American people didn't really vote for Trump. The Russians stole it without evidence.
[55:16.000 --> 55:21.000]  Oh, there's a few Russians maybe talking to people inside the administration to, Trump's not allowed to talk to Russians,
[55:21.000 --> 55:29.000]  to he is a Russian, to he is a quote, domestic enemy and needs to be killed.
[55:29.000 --> 55:38.000]  And then they search engine. I didn't even know that there were articles everywhere today saying, kill Trump, CIA, kill Trump.
[55:38.000 --> 55:45.000]  I mean, the so-called left is just a bunch of mentally ill losers that hate everybody in prosperity and hate somebody trying to cut their taxes.
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.000]  They're just a bunch of miserable morons that have been conned.
[55:48.000 --> 55:55.000]  And they're such losers, they're like brainwashed by their very Stockholm controllers.
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  There's one of the articles.
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  What was the date of that?
[55:59.000 --> 56:03.000]  That was December 21, shock claim the CIA is trying to assassinate Donald Trump.
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  They were certainly pushing the idea beforehand.
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  There's a bunch of others where I said they're going to build it up and then say time to killing.
[56:09.000 --> 56:10.000]  And now they're doing it.
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  Alex Jones, the CIA is trying to assassinate Donald Trump.
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.000]  I said they're preparing everyone December 20th.
[56:16.000 --> 56:23.000]  That's the line to want to do it to sell the idea to normalize it before they do it.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  They're preparing the ground.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  And what comes next?
[56:27.000 --> 56:34.000]  The killing of the 45th president or setting a new coffin DC or blowing up federal buildings and claiming patriots did it.
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  I mean, they're moving and everybody just needs to know.
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.000]  Look at who the globalist are.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  Look at who's running things.
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  Look at who's doing this to our country.
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.000]  And remember, someday, maybe soon, maybe a long time, I'd be in between.
[56:46.000 --> 56:53.000]  They will be brought to justice and they need to know that because they're a bunch of megalomaniac, narcissistic,
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  borderline personality disorder loons.
[56:56.000 --> 57:03.000]  And me, I'm here letting you know how I feel rallying humanity to get out of their complacency.
[57:03.000 --> 57:07.000]  And I will tell you, the demographics, the numbers,
[57:07.000 --> 57:16.000]  President Trump's operation has directly credited me over the telephone with being one of the key liberty demographics that put Trump over the edge.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  The shock troops, you name it.
[57:17.000 --> 57:21.000]  And it was everybody together, but I'm just telling you, the enemy knows that.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  Trump's got to press conference for getting in a few minutes.
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  We're going to go to just see what he's saying.
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  Just briefly, I need to find this operation and I need your prayers.
[57:29.000 --> 57:37.000]  We've come out with what is the ultimate caveman true paleo formula made with cartilage bone broth and paleo ingredients.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  The next generation of advanced paleo nutrition.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  Everybody's into it way and stuff.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  Yeah, that's great folks.
[57:42.000 --> 57:43.000]  And you can obviously mix this with milk.
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.000]  It's got a little bit of sweetener from Stevie and chocolate, you know, in it.
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.000]  It's cocoa, but we're going to come up with one that is unflavored as well.
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  But the point is, it's amazing.
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  It's the highest quality.
[57:54.000 --> 57:58.000]  It is concentrated and it supports the broadcast.
[57:58.000 --> 58:02.000]  There are competitors out there that don't have half the substance this does that costs more.
[58:02.000 --> 58:03.000]  And it's discounted out of the gates.
[58:03.000 --> 58:04.000]  A lot of folks are getting it.
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.000]  So thank you for your support caveman true paleo.
[58:07.000 --> 58:12.000]  We also have the fluoride free toothpaste with iodine and colloidal silver and more.
[58:12.000 --> 58:18.000]  Super blue and info wars life.com and four store.com.
[58:18.000 --> 58:23.000]  You get great things you need yourself, your family, your body, and you fund the operation.
[58:23.000 --> 58:27.000]  So whether it's X to the good halogen or brain force,
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  our secret 12, it's all available at info wars store.com.
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  You can also get your, oh, I got something key to say when we come back.
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.000]  We got it.
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  Oh, I meant to start the show with this.
[58:37.000 --> 58:38.000]  This is so in.
[58:38.000 --> 58:39.000]  Stay with us.
[58:39.000 --> 58:40.000]  This is key.
[58:40.000 --> 58:41.000]  Tell everybody to tune in folks.
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  This is this is total war against humanity.
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  We're going to defeat them.
[58:50.000 --> 58:53.000]  Since the federal judge has halted Trump's executive order,
[58:53.000 --> 58:57.000]  60% of the refugee arrivals to the United States have come from terror prone countries.
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  In fact, the most terror prone.
[58:59.000 --> 59:02.000]  Since US district judge James Robards restraining order,
[59:02.000 --> 59:06.000]  the United States has taken 532 refugees from Syria,
[59:06.000 --> 59:10.000]  a civil war torn country ripe with terrorists in which president Assad of Syria
[59:10.000 --> 59:14.000]  and US intelligence agencies said are infiltrating refugee groups.
[59:14.000 --> 59:18.000]  472 refugees from Iraq where Americans can't even go out on the streets.
[59:18.000 --> 59:23.000]  363 from Somalia where we already had a refugee stab 11 people at Ohio State.
[59:23.000 --> 59:29.000]  117 refugees from Iran where they just last week held a march where they marched on the American flag
[59:29.000 --> 59:35.000]  and chanted death to the US in the streets and 65 are from Sudan a failed state
[59:35.000 --> 59:41.000]  for a total of 1549 refugees from terrorist prone countries since February 3rd.
[59:41.000 --> 59:44.000]  If any terror attacks happen at the hands of these refugees,
[59:44.000 --> 59:47.000]  we know where to look and it ate Trump for info wars.com.
[59:47.000 --> 59:49.000]  This is Owen Shroyer.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  People ask me and that's why I say it every hour.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  They say are you fake?
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  Everything I say, I believe.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  Unless I'm doing a comedy piece and it's satire, then I tell you it's satire.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  I don't even do a lot of satire now because it's just things are so serious.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  But I get pent up, I get really upset and then I just let it out on air
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  and then sometimes when I really get upset and realize that I'm absolutely on target
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  and that they're going to cause a civil war, kill Trump, you name it if we don't stop them.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  I mean, I want to do something.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  It's like knowing your neighbors, houses on fire, kids out in the street about to be run over by truck.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  I mean, you get upset.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  I care.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  And I'm not saying I'm perfect, but man, I've been in restaurants like I told the story.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  My son was only about a year old and I'm in a restaurant and I go to the bathroom,
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  come back out, family and they're going 911, call 911, call 911.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  Like a bunch of birds around this woman turning blue and leaning over the table.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  And I go, I'm like maneuver.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  They're like, 911, sir, we're waiting for 911.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Ambulances are being called.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  And I'm just like, she'll be dead in four minutes.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  So I had to actually push these beta males and people aside.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  It was a little Madeline restaurant and I had to get in there and this woman probably weighed 250 pounds
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  and she was an older down syndrome person.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  Well, one of the older ones I've seen, probably 40.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  And I got her and picked her up, got the food out.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  It was a big old piece of bread.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  It was like a huge chunk turns pink turns white.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Oh, and I knew that they'd sue me or something.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  Cause I kind of felt a rib doodle or something.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  I mean, she was hard to get up and they were all going, oh, thank you.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  You're a hero.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Oh my God.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  Oh, she okay?
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  I know these are rats.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  Get away.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  I'll be sued.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  I can't even help anybody.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  It's like when cops help people and they get sued.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  So it's just, it's like, I'm not one of those people.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  Okay.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  I don't plan any Mr. America or Captain US area and stuff and have all the answers.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  But I'm telling you, I'm not out to get people.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  Let me show TV viewers who's not out to get you as well.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  This is on info wars.com by Dan Lyman.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Trump forage plan massive charity rally in UK breaking parliamentary blockade.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Yeah.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  Trump's not allowed to come speak to the parliament.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  American presidents aren't welcome because they don't want to be, have open borders and
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  be globalist.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  I mean, how ridiculous is that?
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  When you sit back and look at all this president to bypass politicians, raise money for British
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  vats instead.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  And look at those two guys, man.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  That photo, I remember us does take their working late at night planning stuff.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Right.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  And this is, ah, ah, ah, compare that to photos of Hayden and a crapper Brennan and other
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  miscreant creatures and, and, and, and, and, and little know it all Twitch like crystal.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  Just compare that.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  Look at the arrogance.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  You imagine.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  Okay.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  I told you the big news is coming up.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  I need to settle down.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  I'm not going to apologize for earlier because it's, it's what we need to be doing.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  Getting upset.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  It says some really good things are happening.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  Overall, things are very, very positive, but they're still so dangerous.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  It's like you look at your son or your daughter that's doing good school, working out hard,
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  loves God strong.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  And you, it makes you love them that much more and worry about it that much more.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  So I'm worried about the prodigal sons here.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  Cause let me tell you the, the amount of movement and the bunkers being built and Obama moving
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  in saying he's at war with Trump and, and, and, and all the buildup to try to take the
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  president out and, and CIA people saying he's a enemy agent.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  He's a quote domestic enemy and he's to be taken out on CNN.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  I mean, they've now hit that level.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  So if you're not in the streets, if you're not rallying, if you're not good, don't wait
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  for others, just go do it at your capitals, at your city halls, at your call into C-SPAN.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  In fact, I'm going to talk when we come back about what I know Trump should do.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  And Mr. President, you're really smart.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  They got you on a dizzying schedule, trying to get your cabinet in so you can like actually
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  govern, but they're going to sabotage you before that ever happens.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  This is the big push right now.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  If Trump beats this one, they're going to diminish and it's not going to be as bad,
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  but this is it.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  I mean, my gut tells me, I mean, I can hardly sleep at this point.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  I am just completely, I mean, you know, I'm trying to control myself.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  Okay.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Because I mean, this is it.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  This is it.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  And this is for all the marbles.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  The global forget their ass is a kick right now.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  This is it.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:06:15.000]  This is it.
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  This is it.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  This is it.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  And just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  It helps detoxify.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  I'm taking it now every day.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  This is so key.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  Biotrue selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  Exclusively available at m4warslife.com or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  I've been saying we're the Resistance to the Globalist for 20 years.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  And now what do you see the number one Democratic Party operative?
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  Facebook, Twitter, Google, all of them saying they are the Resistance.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  Michael Moore is the Resistance.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  No, the entire corporate media, all the big globalist foreign banks, all the big foreign evil countries like Communist China and Saudi Arabia,
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  they're all weighing in and all the rogue elements of the CIA are all weighing in saying Trump's a quote,
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  domestic enemy on CNN, Evan McMullen last night and needs to be taken out.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  The President is announcing his new secretary and he's in the press conference now,
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  but he had a statement on the media and their deception.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  And I've been saying this, he lost the first debate because he was nice and didn't go on the offense.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  So what if she's a woman, she's a criminal, she sucked Haiti dry, she's a war criminal, Benghazi.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  He goes on and on.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  He tore up in the second one and he dominated and he surged the polls.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  Trump has to come out and Paul's going to do an article on this and we've covered it a lot,
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  how China and Saudi Arabia and others openly funded Hillary and say,
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  okay, you have your investigations if my people talk to Russians, I'm the President.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  Of course, we talk to the Russians over the phone.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  We're having a meet with Putin.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  That's what he should say.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  You think the public's that dumb?
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  And we're going to now have an investigation of the Chinese and the Saudi Arabians and everybody else
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  openly bragging that I wasn't going to win because they were giving money to Hillary
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  and just start indicting these people.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  Sessions needs to be turned loose.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  Not vindictively, Hillary needs to go to prison.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  We sell Hillary for prison 2017.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  On the back it says deport Soros and there are petitions at White House.gov right now to deport Soros.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  Trump needs to go on the offense or I'm here to tell you, Mr. President,
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  I began saying on November 10th they're going to say you're a Russian agent.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  They're going to build it up in a continuum until they say you're a Russian agent,
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  need to be overthrown so they can get a group to believe they followed orders in case they get stopped or defeated
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  to follow orders and try to kill you claiming you're a Russian agent
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  and use that as a cover story if the public learns about it.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  And you, of course, understand this is going on.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  They're trying to get rid of the head of your private security right now.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  You know they've got the Secret Service infiltrated.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  That's admitted.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  Most of them are good people.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  But the federal government has been totally infiltrated by globalist operatives and here's the deal.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  I want to fix things peacefully.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  We've gone a long way.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  We have to argue with CIA people and stuff that I've talked to on air and off air.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  Again, I'm not with the CIA.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  I talk to everybody and they'd say, oh, we need to have our own conservative or libertarian spring here in this country.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  We need to take these people on.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  And I said, we're kicking their butt in the Info War.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  That's why the state's false flags to blame us.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  We don't need to get violent.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  We need to get political and win.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  But we have elected a president.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  We have foreign multinational groups involved openly giving money
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  to build a bunker two miles away with Obama in it with 30,000 activists to try to overthrow the president.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  That's illegal.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  That's not free speech.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  That's called espionage.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  That's called sedition.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  That's called paramilitary stuff the CIA did in a bunch of countries to overthrow them.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  And they're openly running this operation and I get they want to trick Trump into overreacting.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  But it's not overreacting when they're committing crimes.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  So at this point, the president has a responsibility to have a big press conference lay out what they've done.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  If his own people, I know Banda knows what's going on, can't lay it out.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  We're bored and happy.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  Obviously the president does or says what we say or do, but he gets our points.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  We've already got the reports out.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  We'll codify and put it all out.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  We'll show you where they bragged that they ran the election and they gave money.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  The Saudis bragged they funded Hillary 20%, totally illegal.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  Arrest her ass right now.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  It's not hard to do.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  And by the way, I'm not stupid.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  Everybody else is scared to say this and do this in his entourage and in Congress because they all know what happens.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  I'm not scared.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  God's going to take care of my kids and my family.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  That's all that matters.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  I am so because there's no future with them winning.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  I'm not going to just sit here and play patsy cake with these people and halfway fight them.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  I'm not playing games.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  If I'm one thing you can say Alex Jones is genuine, genuine article.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  And what does that mean?
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  I'm not going to support a fifth column of pedophiles and scumbags that openly say they're going to be rich and we're all going to be poor.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  And then a man comes in who's Americana and delivers on what he said he'd do.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  And they're just fighting to make sure you don't learn.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  He did what he said he'd do.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  Quite frankly, since Andrew Jackson or George Washington, I never seen anything like this.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  Right now, Trump is already in the top three presidents of all time.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  And notice his office is full of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  And the CIA in public affairs puts out reports going, okay, he's totally for real.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  He wants Americana.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  Oh my God.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  He's going to take over our whole operation that we built worldwide using American money and power.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  But what are you going to do?
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  Le Pen is saying everything I say.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Everything Trump says because it's the truth.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  Le Pen, is it listening to me?
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  Le Pen's listening to me from 20 years ago.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  And Barry Goldwater from 50 years ago.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  And Ron Paul from 30 years ago.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  And Matt Drudge from 21 years ago.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  Those ripples went out across the globe.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  And now they're devastating.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  And if you think ripples from 20, 30 years ago are hurting you right now, what do you think is going to happen when the tsunami mega waves yet?
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  And they're coming in quicker.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  It's not going to take 30 years now.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  They're coming in six months apart, months apart, weeks apart, days apart, hours apart, minutes apart.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  You think you'll stop human ascension and God's plan.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  All that matters is that my spirit be lined up with God's and God's plan and to be a good person and try to build and try to help people.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  That's what matters.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  It's the test to not be with them.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  The planet doesn't even matter in the final equation.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  Temporal power is nothing.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  What matters is our choice now, not being with the fallen scum.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  That is Hayden and Evan McMullen and the rest of them and Brennan.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  They can't even get good looking strong men to serve them who have killed hundreds of people and done terrible things because they still have souls.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  They can't join with killing their ancestors country and overrunning a great plan.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  Many people did evil things they believed for America and the whole time they were doing it for dirt bags that hate this country more than anything in the universe.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  How dare them say that national sovereignty and freedom came from the Russians.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  It comes from humans that want freedom and the stronger the humans, the more they're going to want that.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  And they hate the kinship of nations against the global technotronic threat.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  Trump must move not against the mindless people attacking women and burning things and shooting cops in the back.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  That's bad, but that's their free speech to kill the cops.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  I'm being sarcastic.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  All you do is you move against Soros and his controllers and the Clintons.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  You get a couple hundred people, you've got all the data on them.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  Their open statements are criminal.
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  You indict them and just have a war.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  Let them dump all their dirt out.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  It doesn't matter.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  You indict them, bring them in, burn the whole thing down, restore the republic, launch the phoenix.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Do it. Do it.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  Come on. Let's go.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  They want to fight.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  You want one? Let's go.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  I want one too.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  You're going to get one. You're already feeling one.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  So you just keep pushing it, you little pieces of crap.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  Because at the end of the day, you're not going to be getting away with it anymore, are you?
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  You think your wills are so strong, you have no idea.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  God bless Donald Trump.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  And while he's done, God almighty.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  You looked at sessions, getting sworn in.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  I've been watching sessions for 20 years.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  I've never seen sessions so freaked out and so scared.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  Sessions were shaking because he knows he's going to get the green light to go after him.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  And he knows he and his wife and his family are on the very front edge of that sucker.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  Let me tell you something.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  It's not scary when you're on the right edge of good.
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  It's so strong when you start getting close to God.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  And God says, this is what I want you to do.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  And you know you're joining all the good people in history.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  It is the best thing in the universe.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  And it's something these devil worshipers will never understand and they will never feel.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  Now.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  I'm going to skip this break because I want to get to this part with Trump that they already grabbed out when he first responded to the media.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  And as strong as this is, it isn't strong enough.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  He used to throw them all out of the White House.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  We're already in a civil war.
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  Why keep pretending?
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  They're openly calling for his murder and overthrow on CNN.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  When you get to that point, you have to move.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  Go to the clip.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  Am I making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  This morning because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  And I hope going forward we can be a little bit a little bit different and maybe get along a little bit better if that's possible.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  Maybe it's not and that's okay too.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington DC, along with New York, Los Angeles in particular speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  Let's back this up. This is back it up.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  He's declaring the criminal cities where the Mafias are.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  New York, which he knows and built his empire despite them in LA, who just are out to hurt us and hate us.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  He goes, I'd like to work with you.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  I'd like you to run up the white flag.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  All the others give you prosperity, but I'm sorry.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  We're not going to have child kidnapping and murder rings.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  Listen, it's going to stop. It's over. You wanted to kill the country. You wanted to bring the world into depression and have wars.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  We're not suicidal. That's all this is.
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  But you don't want that?
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  Okay.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  I trust Trump.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  He knows what to do.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  This is hardcore folks.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  The energy level is 100 times what I've ever felt it.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  I can't even eat.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  I haven't even eaten.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  I see all the data. I know what they're planning and then all of the world nationalism is exploding.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  They're losing. That's why it's so dangerous.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  Let's continue with the president from the start. Sorry.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  This morning because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different and maybe get along a little bit better if that's possible.
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  Maybe it's not and that's okay too.
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C. along with New York, Los Angeles in particular speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  Tremendous disservice. We have to talk about it to find out what's going on because the press honestly is out of control.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  The level of dishonesty is out of control.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  I ran for president to represent the citizens of our country.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  I am talking and really talking on this very entrenched power structure and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  We're talking about its entrenchment.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort, not all the time, and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  They're honest and fantastic.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  But much of it is not.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  The distortion, and we'll talk about it, you'll be able to ask me questions about it.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  But we're not going to let it happen because I'm here again to take my message straight to the people.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  To be honest, I inherited a mess.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  It's a mess.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  At home and abroad, a mess.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  Jobs are pouring out of the country.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  You see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  Low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  The Middle East, a disaster.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  North Korea, we'll take care of it, folks.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  We're going to take care of it all.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  I just want to let you know I inherited a mess.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you've covered,
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  to move forward towards stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  We've had great conversations with the United Kingdom and meetings.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  Really, really productive conversations.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  I would say far more productive than you would understand.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  Very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  He's over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  It used to be a small group.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  Now it's in large sections of the world.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  They've spread like cancer.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  ISIS has spread like cancer.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  Another mess I inherited.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran who's totally taken advantage of our previous administration.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  And they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  And we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  And it's not properly solved now.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  It's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  I've ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  I've had great support from the Senate.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  I've had great support from Congress generally.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  And I will tell you, that is my – I would be so happy if we never had to use it.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  But our country will never have had a military like the military were about to build and rebuild.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  But they don't have the right equipment and their equipment is old.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  I used it.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  I talked about it at every stop.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  Depleted.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  It's depleted.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  Won't be depleted for long.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  And I think one of the reasons I'm standing here instead of other people is that, frankly,
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  I talked about we have to have a strong military.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  We have to have strong law enforcement also.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  All right.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  Let's stop right there.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  So we do not go –
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  There's more of the press conference coming up.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  That's from about 10 minutes ago because we can obviously go back to the beginning.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  And we'll have some of the excerpts for you of some of the press conference.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  We have a live feed of it at infowars.com if you want to look at it.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  The reason I've got so upset is things couldn't be more historical.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  Never in the history of the world has something gone on like this.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  And never before have we had such crazed, crazy, evil, corrupt people in charge who were so arrogant
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  that the outgoing CIA director told the president, watch his mouth.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  I mean, this is just total belligerence by the hijackers of this country.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  I want to be clear whether it's the NSA or the CIA or Defense Intelligence or on and on and on.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  It's just people like you and I.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  But when you get into these globalists and these neocons and these leftists,
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  they all support world government.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  And they all want to be the technocrat class that serves the big mega banks, serves the big Googles.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  And the rest of us just don't exist.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  They're a bunch of very, very selfish, very, very evil people.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  And it'd be one thing if they were like super strong and doing some great things and venting all this stuff.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  And then they said, oh, you're all ugly. You're going to kill you.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  I'd still fight back because I want to survive.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  It's like they're the worst scum that snuck in and used our goodwill and our blind spot to hijack civilization.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  And now we're telling us we don't have a place in the future.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  Hey, I got a little newsflash for you.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  If you want me to die.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  No, no, no, you will die.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  I don't mean that as some physical threat.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  I don't say things I don't then carry out or attempt to carry out.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  I'm saying metaphysically, historically, those that live by the sword, die by the sword.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  And that doesn't just mean if you are in the military to die by the sword.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  It means if you live by it, you're out taking with it.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  So I'm putting the word out and then God's going to take care of everything.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  But that means working through men and women.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  Then said Jesus unto them, put up again, thy sword into his place.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  For all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  They also said go forth and buy a sword.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  So it's all very sophisticated.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  You have to have discernment to understand it.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  It's written so that the profane or the wicked ones don't understand it.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  And to them it's all a big joke.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  You can pull up those Bible verses as well.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  He that leadeth unto captivity shall go into captivity.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  He that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  That's King James, Revelation 1310.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  That's speaking about specifically bondage and enslavement by the Antichrist forces against Christians.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  It made no mistake.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  All of this is preparation for humanity to face much bigger threats.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  If we have victory over this at this point, still, there are much greater threats coming on the road.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  But this is an example of the ebb and flow and history of good and evil.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  It says, is Twitter censoring positive replies to Donald Trump's tweets?
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  Paul Watson has done his article.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  I've talked to people who know about Twitter and how it works.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  I just want to use it.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  I call myself on a scale of 1 to 10 knowing how Twitter works, maybe a 2.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  But I've talked to Twitter experts.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  They say it's definitely going on.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  They just put the negative ones at the top and then, you know, so that way he doesn't respond to people.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  Twitter appears to be censoring positive replies to President Donald Trump's tweets and only showing negative responses.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  Yeah, this has been going on for weeks.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  I've gone back and looked.
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  So Paul documents all that.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  I'm going to take liberty and just point out that we should probably change the headline and say clear evidence shows they're censoring the responses to his tweets and manipulating his Twitter account.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  I mean, that's really the big issue is they're manipulating the Twitter account.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  You've got screenshots of all this.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  And they admit they're starting to gauge everything and govern it and manipulate it.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  I mean, it's been going on a while now.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  They're just rolling it out, which means even more war stuff is about to happen.
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  We're going to come back with our special guest getting into General Flynn and how it was tied into a piece of gate straight ahead.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  And please support us and spread the links in the articles.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  They may try to censor us on big platforms, but we're huge as well.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  So spread those links from M4Wars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and spread the link to M4Wars.com for its last show so folks can find the broadcast.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:53.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  We're on the run.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:31:01.000]  We're on the run.
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  We're on the run.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  We use cell phones against our heads every day.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  But now a landmark US government study confirms increased health risks from exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  The time to protect yourself is now.
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  The solution is Defender Shield.

[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  The body is saying that it is time to take Extendivite.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  These are not the normal signs of aging.
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  They are the warning signs that accompany blocked arteries.

[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  We're going to talk to former CIA field operative.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  That means he wasn't just one of the little analysts up there calling for Trump's overthrow.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  He's a tough guy.
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  He's going to be breaking down just the whole waterfront.
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  I don't know all of his views on this.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  I've read some of it.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  It's pretty controversial.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  A lot of it ties in information.
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  I know it's true.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  I respect the guy.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  We're going to get his take on this and how Flynn's resignation ties into the whole battle to take out the pedophiles.
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  I know Flynn was pushing for that.
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  So is Sessions and others.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  You see the pedophiles getting rolled up around the country and around the world.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  We told you that was coming.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  So there is a huge civil war inside the government going on right now.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  It's very sophisticated.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  And Trump is playing basically four or five D chess.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  We'll see where all this goes.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  We're going to be talking to our guest here in just a moment.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  First off, I was researching the very best stuff for joints and muscles as I get older and I work out.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  Sometimes my joints hurt.
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  And the biggest hottest thing obviously is bone broth and collagen.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  And I said, well, let's go out and produce that.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  And we found out the other leading competitors might put, you know, $3 of stuff in their can and sell it for 50.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  Well, that's not what we do.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  We load it with the very best cleanest collagens out there.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  That comes from chickens, folks.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  Beef could have some issues.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  Bone broth, paleo ingredients, you name it.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  It is all in there.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  Alfalfa herb powder.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  We've got the multi-collagen complex.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  We've got the changa mushroom.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  We've got the bee pollen.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  The turmeric root is the big one.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  That helps accelerate all of the different ingredients obviously into the body, into the bloodstream and clean out the cells.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  Turmeric is well known for all the amazing things it does.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  This is a big dose of it.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  Now, this is a little bit of cocoa and a little bit of stevia and tastes great.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  If you mix it with milk, it's even better, but a lot of folks want to be skinny.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  But I've been taking it with milk and my joints and everything.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  I mean, it's been miraculous, the few areas that we're hurting, what it's done.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  It's the best out there and it's less priced than many of the competitors as well.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  And if you go back to what humans were doing 10,000 years ago, here's a Daily Mail article,
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  how modern humans have become weaklings compared to our ancient ancestors
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  who could outrun and outlive today's top athletes, just the average person could.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  They dig up bodies in what's England today or what's, you know, what's Nigeria today
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  and the anthropologists and archaeologists find the same deal.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  This is well known.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  Man's intelligence, humans intelligence peaked thousands of years ago
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  and we've been on an intellectual and emotional and physical decline ever since then.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  And one of the big things they believe is people aren't grinding up bones.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  Used to grind it up, put it in the bread.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  It's called the minerals, trace elements, the bone marrow is full of stem cells.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  Even if it's desiccated, it gets into your body.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  It does amazing, amazing things.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  It's like chicken broth.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  He's had the chicken bones in it, you know, when you have the flu or whatever.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  Well, this is like a mega dose of that.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  A little scoop in there with your water or whatever at lunch.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  Well, in fact, I'm going to take some of this next hour for my lunch.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  So again, caveman true paleo formula available at infowarstore.com

[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  by their corporate sponsorships.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  We have the model that's dominating the media and no one else.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  I guess those have to figure out how to do it.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  I'm not bragging. It's actually crazy.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  Almost the other people picked us up direct sales to your audience.

[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  very best probiotic.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  We could took us four years to come out with us.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  It's amazing.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  These strains, vitamin, mineral, fusion, amino acid, fruit punch string,
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  knock out sleep aid.

[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  melatonin, you name it, put it in one powerful pill.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  Watch out if you take two of them though.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  It's all over the counter infowarslife.com or triple eight two five three three
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  one three nine.
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  Okay, breaking.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  We have reporters in DC.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  I'm tempted to try to get them on next hour.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  We have a Washington Post reporter coming on tomorrow.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  We've got a Washington, a reporter, a Jerome Corsi with Muslim sympathizers
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  CIA behind Trump leaks.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  And then we've also got a New York Post reporter coming on next hour.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  How Obama is scheming to sabotage Trump presidency with a bunker and 30,000
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  activists and we now have CIA operatives that have been involved in covert actions
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  the type to overthrow countries coming out saying that Trump is called a
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  domestic enemy Evan McMullen.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  He fits the cast of these guys who never actually, he's commanded people but
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  never been out in the field like steel.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  And I'm not knocking guys that have been out in combat.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  I haven't been, you know, just as a citizen, but I'm so sick of them always
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  running around calling for overthrows, murder, death, you know, corruption.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  Watch your mouth like, like, like Brennan said.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  Now, I don't know everything steel is going to get into.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  He, I got some articles of his and I read him yesterday and it's pretty
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  shocking stuff.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  I just had him here in my stack and we'll put some of those up on screen for folks.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  But he's saying it all ties in to the pedophiles and more.
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  So we'll get his breakdown on that right now.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  Robert David steel.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  You've got a bunch of websites.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  Which one's best for folks to visit?
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  Robert David steel.com is the easiest to remember.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  Phi Beta Iota.net is the one with all the good stuff.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  It's the one with all the posts from 80 people that I curate.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  Well, again, I read like three of your articles this morning and I don't know
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  where to start.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  It makes my head spin.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  Let's just lay it out.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  Lay out the information.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  Let's start with McMullen's the lightweight.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  This is a little man who's got no serious credibility in either the
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  intelligence community or the real world.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  He's just running his mouth.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  I happen to be a complete independent.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  And I believe that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  And you and Gary Null and a whole bunch of important people are starting to
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  talk about how Donald Trump might be our one chance to take down the deep state.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  I absolutely believe that.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  Now I've published some posts.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Part of Trump's problem is that he wasn't expecting to win.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  And when he won by accident, I've written it's both free online and it's
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  also a bestseller at Kindle.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  Donald Trump, the accidental president, analyzes how he won at the very end
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  because Clinton collapsed in multiple ways.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  Well, and because the intelligence agencies wanted him to win.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  Well, no, actually some of us within the...
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  Well, no, exactly.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  I'm not saying everybody, but the people that weren't at the top.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Yeah.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  Well, there was a huge fight between John Brennan, who was representing Hillary
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  Clinton, Wall Street, the deep state and the Saudis.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  And the rest of us.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  And Steve Piaznack is one of my favorite people.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  He announced that there were white hats.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  The white hats were able to stop Hillary Clinton from using the same
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  electronic fraud that she used against Bernie Sanders.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  She stole 13 primaries from Bernie Sanders.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  That was confirmed by Stanford University.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  They were able to stop that.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  And she wasn't able to steal 13 general elections from Donald Trump.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  But coming back to Donald Trump.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  His problem was that he had to get from election day to inauguration day.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  And he had to get through the electoral college, the congressional
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  validation and inauguration day.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  And as you all saw, John Brennan committed treason by telling lies
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  intended to overturn the electoral college.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  And we've never seen a CIA...
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  I mean, in the past, if a CIA director said to the president,
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  keep your mouth shut, they would die in a canoeing accident within hours.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  And I'm not even saying do that. This is unprecedented.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  It is unprecedented.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  John Brennan is, in my view, until he resigned and may be still today,
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  the highest paid agent of Saudi Arabia.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  John Brennan is corrupt to the bone and he should be under deep FBI investigation.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  But set him aside.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  Donald Trump is there now.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  The point I'm trying to make is that to get from election day to
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  inauguration day, Trump had to make some deals and rents Priebus, the Judas
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  in the White House, was part of that.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  I agree. In fact, a lot of really smart top people say that's Trump's big mistake.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  He thought he could co-opt them because they just wanted power.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  And instead, no, they've got, there's dirt on them.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  They're part of something bigger.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  And that's why Trump's got to get rid of them.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  Priebus is, among other things, an enabler and cover-upper of pedophilia.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  Dennis Hassard is the tip of the iceberg.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  I absolutely guarantee you that Julian Assange is going to take down
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  the Republican Party and rents Priebus specifically.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  Well, let me just stop you.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  I know you've got a lot of high-level sources.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  This is shocking right now because I've had you on for a decade.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  You're very respected.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  And while the clandestine operations, all the Middle East, all the world,
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  and I know you wouldn't just say this because this opens you up to a lot.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  Now, I'm not saying this is your opinion.
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  I'm saying you're a guest on my show saying this right now because the media...
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  Oh, Alex, don't be chicken.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  Well, no, no, listen, I'm not chicken.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  I know about Hassard.
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  I know about his connections to the Clintons.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  I know about the whole network.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  I know it's true.
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  This is on me.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  This is on me.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  This is not on you.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  This is on me.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  Okay?
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  This is...
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  Here's my Marine Corps serial rent.
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  This is on me.
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  I have for over a decade been working with a number of people on pedophilia
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  as an elite privilege.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  For the Democrats, it's actually an acquired taste.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  John Podesta is a pedophile light.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  The Republicans and the elite in banking are the ones who have really made this a big league thing.
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  There are Saudi Arabian restaurants with basements in Washington, D.C.,
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  where you can order children on the menu.
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  Okay?
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  This is what I have been told.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  I have not been to one of those restaurants.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  I've never ordered a child on the menu.
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  Pedophilia is the Achilles heel, and Donald Trump has figured that out.
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  Now, Flynn did not get fired because he called the Russians.
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  I would remind your viewers that Henry Kissinger sabotaged the Paris Beast walks
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  and killed another 20,000 U.S. troops and hundreds of thousands of others
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  just to help Richard Nixon get elected.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  Hillary Clinton sold Syria and Yemen to Saudi Arabia for tens of millions of dollars.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  Okay?
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  Flynn got fired because he had the arrogance to think that he could tell Mattis
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  and tell us in what to do.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  He also managed to piss off the vice president.
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  Flynn's call included, and this is insider information.
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  Flynn's call included a conversation about a list of high-level pedophiles in the United States,
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  one of whom is Mike Pence's best friend.
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  And Flynn did not tell Pence.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  That eventually came out.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  Now, the real issue, as Dennis Kasinich has very carefully pointed out on Fox,
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  the real issue is that NSA has been spying on all of our politicians with impunity,
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  and the CIA is leaking highly classified information as part of a political coup d'etat.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  If I were in Donald Trump's shoes, I would be shutting NSA down.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  NSA has no legislative charter.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  Donald Trump has the power to shut NSA down tomorrow.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  Let's be clear.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  It's clearly illegal what's going on, and then the leaks are illegal.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  Let me ask you this then.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  I know you've done your 10 years or 12 years.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  You wouldn't be saying this.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  You didn't at least have the sources.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  Clearly they're trying to overthrow Trump right now.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  All this crazy stuff's going on.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  Who are the main power blocks in your view?
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  And how is it going in the war against Trump?
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  All of your smart viewers know what a tiny URL is.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  So at tinyurl.com forward slash memo number four, Trump.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  Memo for Trump is my memorandum to Donald Trump, which is I am told now in Trump's hands,
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  in Steve Bannon's hands, and possibly in Kellyanne Conway's hands.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  Trump has three major enemy groups.
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  Enemy group number one is George Soros, Tom Steyer, and other billionaires who are behind
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  what is going to be a violent American spring.
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  The American spring is going to begin as soon as the weather gets nice with tens of thousands
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  of paid agitators across the country, and it is going to end with three million people
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  being bussed into Washington D.C. on May Day, on the 1st of May.
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  And they're testing their databases right now with these fake women marches,
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  and even fusing it with Islam.
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  Yes. Alex, you've covered this, and you know what I'm talking about,
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  but I don't think people are really understanding.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  And unfortunately, Trump doesn't have advisors who are very broad in nature.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  I love Steve Bannon, but I've recommended that he...
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  Well, he's overwhelmed. He's also getting isolated.
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  But I don't want to... Let's go through the points.
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  So obviously, they're going to have a three million march. They admit that.
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  They're going to burn everything down.
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  But it's not just the left that's trying to kill Donald Trump.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  The right wing Republicans.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  Dick Cheney is still Darth Vader.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  Dick Cheney is orchestrating penetrations of the government.
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  And in fact, I've recommended to Trump that he fire the director of the office
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  of presidential personnel, DeStefano, who was put in there by previous,
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  specifically to front load all of Donald Trump's political appointees
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  with molds from the establishment.
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  Dick Cheney is hijacking this government just as he hijacked the government of George Bush.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  And I would point your listeners, your viewers, to a book called Vice.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  Dick Cheney and the hijacking of the American presidency.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  The third enemy group that Donald Trump is facing is the deep state,
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  which is the traders.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  I think there's 500 of them across the United States government
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  who have sold out for money, for ideology, or for religion.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  There are three different groups that are after Donald Trump.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  And there are three things Donald Trump has to do to survive the next 90 days.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  The first is an electoral reform act so that he recruits the 73% that did not vote for him.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  The second is a Trump channel so that he can bypass the media
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  and work through people like you and Greg Hunter and other...
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  Sure, you should just go on every day with press announcements himself
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  or what others are just laying out.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  Think about a seven-minute fireside chat from the president every day.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  And then think about all of his cabinet officials being brought in
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  to do seven- to 15-minute YouTubes.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  And then think about Donald Trump asking America a question with a tweet
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  and using poll mole, P-O-L-L-M-O-L-E, poll mole.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  With poll mole, I can get 150 million viewers.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  No, that's it. He must mobilize his base.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  It's just sitting on the sideline because they're mobilizing their armies right now.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  We must mobilize.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  Yes, but we need to mobilize the 70% that George Soto doesn't control.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  This morning when I came in, I meant to get on air and say,
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  become activists, call C-SPAN, get in the streets.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  What do people need to do to expose this?
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  I mean, you're dead on about other plan.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  Alex, I certainly am a very humble person.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  And these have been eight very hard years wandering in the wilderness.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  My bottom line is Donald Trump needs to sit down and listen.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  I have had for a number of years...
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  I've been trying to get hold of him since July of 2015.
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  And I wrote the first article, Counter-Coup, how Donald Trump can win.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  It appeared in Counter-Punch, which is an excellent magazine in August of 2015.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  Corey Lubakowski blew me off.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  Roger Stone blew me off.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  I visited Paul Manafort's office five times.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  He blew me off.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  Okay?
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  Donald Trump is isolated.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  His mail is being controlled.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  He's not getting to sit down with people like...
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  I'll name five names.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  Robert Steele, Dennis Kasinich, Cynthia McKinney, Ralph Nader and Jesse Ventura.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  You put those five people in an office with Donald Trump,
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  you announce the electoral reform act,
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  and you have those five people in Donald Trump brainstorm the country.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  Fifty states in 30 days.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  I guarantee you, we will own this country for the people.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  You're just saying, would that type of diverse crowd would be optics for the public?
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  This was a big table for everybody.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  What Trump's doing...
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  What is this optics for the public?
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  Donald Trump has to understand the Republican Party is toast.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  Well, the Republican Party is definitely at the top out to get Trump
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  and block the American people along with Democrats.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  Especially the Republicans, the Democrats and the globalists as main enemies.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  How will you spend your tax return?
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  Will a new TV or the newest cell phone protect you when the unexpected happens?
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  You and your family could be left helpless,
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  waiting for a slow-acting FEMA to come to your rescue.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  In a disaster, local store shelves are emptied at just hours.

[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  Music playing.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  The media is always asking, what do you talk to Trump about?
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  I go, well, I'll tell you this.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  I say, sir, please go out for China openly giving money to Hillary, Saudi Arabia and the Russians.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  And here's all the articles, sir.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  And he's sitting there, you know, writing them down while I'm talking to him.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  He goes, I know, I know.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  And he goes, and the OPM hack.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  Well, God, that was under Obama.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  You know, 15 million names.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  I'm like, I know, sir, I know.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  And he's like, so if you want to know what I've talked about, Trump, it's that.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  I have personally begged him to do this.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  And so, I mean, I've said the common sense is just let the law be carried out.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  And of all these, you know, Republicans and Democrats, like he said during his inauguration,
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  we're going after everybody, they've all been on the Russian payroll.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  I'm not attacking the Russians.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  That's what governments do.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  Or the Chinese who brag they've done it and say they're going to censor the web, the communist,
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  then arrest them all.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  And I'm not looking for some purge here, but the law is the law.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  And I'm sick of reading the newspaper.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  My own hometown paper has had it three times the last two months in the front of the physical metro
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  and state that I'm a, quote, Russian idiot or a Russian dupe or a Russian agent.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  Man, that's weird.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  Okay.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  That's crazy.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  I can speak like two Russian words.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  Okay.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  And that's the level we've reached here.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  And so we're going to have excerpts of that coming up.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  He's still going.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  We're getting the best clips.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  We've got a New York Post reporter coming on where Obama and that's the Soros group are
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  literally admitting they're moving to overthrow Trump.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  But it shows that in the councils that people like Evan McMillan or the CIA are in, they're
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  confident enough.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  Let me tell you something.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:01.400]  You start getting on air as a person that's powerful and saying, you know, the president
[1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:04.200]  is a, quote, domestic enemy and he's be overthrown.
[1:56:04.200 --> 1:56:07.500]  The president has, and the agencies, they follow the constitution have full purview.
[1:56:07.500 --> 1:56:09.000]  You're an outside enemy now.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  I mean, that is not a very good way to be staying around above the, you know, above the dirt
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  level, above the grass.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  I'm not threatening this guy.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  I don't care about him.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  The point is it's really super crazy to be saying this.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  What do you, what do you make of all this rhetoric?
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  Uh, Robert David Steele.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  Well, McMillan has just demonstrated that he's a clickbait.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  He's right up there with Madonna.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  Um, I think very, very poorly of him.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  He is being an irresponsible, unprofessional person.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  Um, Donald Trump for all of his flaws is unshackled.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  And I cannot emphasize this anymore.
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  There is one chance to restore the constitution and restore the republic.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  Now I'm really pleased that Jeff Sessions and James Comey, who appears to have turned
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  around somewhat, they're going after the pedophiles among the elite.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  A number of arrests are expected in the next week or two.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  Uh, and that's putting them on notice.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  That's putting them on notice, isn't it?
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  Yes, it is putting them on notice.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  These people are extremely vulnerable.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  However, one of the problems that I have with Trump's current team is they don't seem to
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  understand that the real enemies, the existential enemies of America are right here at home.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  They are not overseas.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  North Korea is the Chinese's problem.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  Look, look, look, Trump's got to be political some.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  I mean, you know, he's got to have some, if he's going to not start war with Russia and
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  people, he's got to have something, you know, that nationalistic he's going to do.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  I'll tell you what, let's make America great again, starting right here at home.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  What Donald Trump needs to do is restore integrity to our electoral process and our
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  governance process.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  Nothing else matters.
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:58:01.000]  All of these platitudes about Russia and Iran and other countries are platitudes.
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  There is one tangible thing that Donald Trump can do other than firing rents previous, which
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  is he can call for an electoral reform act.
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  And before he does that, I think he should have a very public meeting with Cynthia McKinney,
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  Dennis.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  No, no, no, I hear you.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  And I've seen that, you know, that plan you have.
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  All I'm telling you is, is that I want to come back in 70 seconds to talk more about
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  474 arrests in LA of pedophiles and a bunch of kids actually kept in slave dungeons.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  That's not even on the news.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  That shows how it's a cover up.
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  We're arrest all over the country.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  Arrest of Sandusky's son.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  We've got Weiner, child porn stuff.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  I mean, our law enforcement people told us this three months ago.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  So, I mean, this is really going on.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  And, you know, who had one of the pedophiles?
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  It's Donald Trump.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  And sessions hadn't either.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  They want to go after him.
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:55.000]  Since a federal judge has halted Trump's executive order, 60% of the refugee arrivals to the
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  United States have come from terror-prone countries.
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  In fact, the most terror-prone.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  Since U.S. District Judge James Robarts restraining order, the United States has taken 532
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:09.000]  refugees from Syria, a civil war-torn country, ripe with terrorists, in which President Assad
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  of Syria and U.S. intelligence agencies said are infiltrating refugee groups.
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  472 refugees from Iraq, where Americans can't even go out on the streets.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  363 from Somalia, where we already had a refugee stab 11 people at Ohio State.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  117 refugees from Iran, where they just last week held a march, where they marched on the
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:35.000]  American flag, enchanted death to the U.S. in the streets, and 65 are from Sudan, a failed
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  state, for a total of 1,549 refugees from terrorist-prone countries since February 3rd.
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  If any terror attacks happen at the hands of these refugees, we know where to look,
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  and it ain't Trump.
[1:59:46.000 --> 2:00:12.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  And I agree with almost all of it, other than these roundtable meetings, I think those are
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  fine, too.
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  It's just that I know this, the entire power structures against Trump.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  The foreign banks, the Saudi Arabians, the communist Chinese, it's so obvious, and he's
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  really trying to cut taxes on poor people, have the big banks loaned to local businesses.
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  I mean, it's a real move towards prosperity.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  He's not perfect, but he's just kind of a businessman that did not get the country.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  That doesn't mean he's not going to make mistakes.
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  Are they trying to act confident, or are they really in a megalomaniac way confident that
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  they're going to bring Trump down?
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  Because Michael Moore is saying, we're going to overthrow him.
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  He is a Russian.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  And then the CIA comes out, or he is a Russian.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  We know the talking points.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  They've been building this up.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  Now they're in the news saying, could we kill him?
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  Could the CIA legally kill him?
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  They're really trying to get themselves up to that edge of that cliff.
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  I don't think they realize what's going to come if they do that separately.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  This is in 1963.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  Let's get into what your intel is on more roundups of pedophiles.
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  Well, let me first say that Catherine Austin Fitz, speaking for Greg Hunter, the Underground
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  Show, has a YouTube that I consider to be the single most important piece of advice
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  Donald Trump could ever get.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  They are playing Trump like a fiddle.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  They're going after his women, which makes him crazy.
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  They are undermining him with the media.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  Trump is not focusing.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  He made a huge mistake today in doubling down on a national security advisor.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  What he really needs is a national strategy advisor that can do a whole of government
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  thinking.
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  They're distracting him with filling his cabinet when what matters is he's everything.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  Yes, absolutely right.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  Alex, you are absolutely on target.
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  Donald Trump needs to sit down and game out the next 90 days.
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  And he has to do it in a way that allows him to shut down the two-party tyranny.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  Paul Ryan is not his friend.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  Oh, Paul Ryan is his sworn enemy.
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  In fact, I've got to be honest.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  Here's the thing.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  The Democrat leadership thinks that Russia invaded Korea and doesn't know what day it is.
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  It thinks Bush is an office, but they're all goofy and just...
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  It is like the scariest.
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  The Republican leadership has got their act together, but they're really the threat to
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  Trump, I think.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  I agree with you completely, Alex, and one of the reasons I want to throw the press out
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  of the White House and create a Trump channel in that space is because Fox News is part of
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  the traffic law.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  Oh, they're attacking him backhanded every 10 seconds.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  They are sleazeballs.
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  And frankly, I'm tired of three bimbos in the morning and five jerks at night.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  Fox News is a disgrace to the journalist profession.
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  Trump needs to sit down and think strategically, and he doesn't have anyone that can do that
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  form.
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  I love Bannon, but Bannon needs playmates that are diversified.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  Well, I mean, you know what they're doing.
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  They're trying to run Bannon out.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  Bannon's just trying to get policy down.
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  Yeah, but Bannon's been very good.
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  But here's the bottom line, Alex.
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  If Trump will listen, if Trump will read the memo for Trump, and if Trump will follow this
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  strategy, he could shut down George Sodos within the next 15 days.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  Yeah, why is he scared to have this...
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  I mean, clearly, Soros has committed a bunch of crimes and stuff.
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  He's...
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  He's been dieting.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  Why not pick the gloves off?
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  Frankly, I'm surprised that George Sodos hasn't had a bullet put through his brain.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  We have something called Ranger Justice.
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  It's when specific people understand that certain things need to be done and they do
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  it.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  George Sodos is a dead man walking, in my view.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  I certainly am no threat to George Sodos, but I think he is very, very likely to be
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  assassinated in the next 180 days if he doesn't change his...
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  What I know is people can't go on TV and call the president a domestic enemy and these be
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  overthrown and stuff don't happen.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  That's all I'm saying.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  Alex, we all need to rally behind Donald Trump.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  I just got off Gary Nell, and I'm on with Gary Nell again on Tuesday.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  You're on with us next Tuesday as well.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  I appreciate you.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  Thank you.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  We'll look into all this.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  I mean, a lot of what you're saying I can document.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  I believe you have a good heart or on target and a lot of stuff.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  Who knows?
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  I hope some of this isn't true.
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  It's simply unbelievable.
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  Just look at what we know about the Catholic Church and all this other crap and it's just
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  unbelievable.
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:57.000]  They're definitely covering up pedophilia in the news and the huge, massive roundups
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  of them.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  It's amazing.
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  Thank you, sir.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  In a protest against Donald Trump's tight citizenship policy, a day without immigrants has been
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  declared nationwide.
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  Today, February 16th, 2017 will go down in history as a day without immigrants.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:11.000]  Look around you.
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  Is that person an immigrant?
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  Imagine if they were just gone.
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  But wait a second.
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  This ideal or illustration doesn't make sense.
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:19.000]  President Trump is not deporting immigrants.
[2:05:19.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  In fact, I'm yet to see or hear any policy that deals directly with just immigrants.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  So are citizens of the U.S. that have immigrated here going to take off work in protest for
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  those who want to skirt the legal process that they went through to be an immigrant?
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  An interesting notion.
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  Or will this just be a bunch of self-loathing white liberal college students and older women
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  like usual in a desperate attempt to virtue signal against Trump?
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  Or will non-citizens show up and proudly announce that they work here illegally?
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  The goal of this protest is to display how imperative immigrants are to society.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  Guess we will find that out real quick.
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  Or we will see that people who immigrated here came here to work for a better life and
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:57.000]  have better things to do than protest a process that they followed.
[2:05:57.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  Thank you.
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  Thank you.
