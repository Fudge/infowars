[01:19.020 --> 01:23.420]  really goes to the heart about you know in what way we're under assault at the
[01:23.420 --> 01:30.180]  moment from all sides and that story is Long Island man arrested for defending
[01:30.180 --> 01:37.660]  home with AK-47 from gang and this is the story of George Greer a 30 year old
[01:37.660 --> 01:44.580]  man who sees this gang of five men whom he believes to be from this brutal MS-30
[01:44.580 --> 01:51.420]  gang probably the most you know no no Tories ambitious gang in America walking
[01:51.420 --> 01:57.580]  up his driveway and onto his front lawn now Greer has his wife and children in
[01:57.580 --> 02:05.420]  his house and this gang starts marauding onto his property now we've got a CBS
[02:05.420 --> 02:09.140]  clip coming up at the start of the next segment but this is one of the quotes
[02:09.140 --> 02:14.340]  from Greer quote I went around and went into the house ran upstairs and told my
[02:14.340 --> 02:18.500]  wife to call the police I get the gun and I go outside and I come into the
[02:18.500 --> 02:23.940]  doorway and now by this time they are in the driveway back here near the house I
[02:23.940 --> 02:29.860]  tell them can you please leave and so the gang members then start threatening to
[02:29.860 --> 02:35.220]  kill Greer's wife and young children he's one and two year old babies are in the
[02:35.220 --> 02:40.660]  house alone with his wife so what would any normal person do get Greer goes and
[02:40.660 --> 02:45.780]  grabs his gun he starts threatening my family my life this is what the gang
[02:45.780 --> 02:49.820]  members are saying oh you're dead I'm gonna kill your family and your babies
[02:49.820 --> 02:55.300]  you're dead so when he says that 20 others come rushing around the corner
[02:55.300 --> 03:02.620]  and so I fired four warning shots into the grass Greer said so he's got no less
[03:02.620 --> 03:08.740]  than 25 gang members running on to his front lawn threatening to kill his wife
[03:08.740 --> 03:13.860]  and children he runs to get his gun showed remarkable restraint in the
[03:13.860 --> 03:21.060]  circumstances by firing it only into the lawn of his garden so you've got two
[03:21.060 --> 03:24.900]  dozen vicious gang members running towards your driveway while their
[03:24.900 --> 03:28.660]  buddies who are already on your land threatening that they're gonna kill your

[03:47.700 --> 03:54.580]  gunshots within a certain area and quick as a flash the police are on the scene
[03:54.580 --> 04:01.340]  and they apprehend and arrest the victim of this terrifying ordeal that's right
[04:01.340 --> 04:06.620]  the the horde of gang bangers who are threatening to kill his wife and kids are
[04:06.620 --> 04:13.260]  left completely alone and Greer is arrested for what they call reckless
[04:13.260 --> 04:19.900]  endangerment now bearing in mind the weapon was legally owned the AK-47
[04:19.900 --> 04:25.820]  completely legal Greer is on his own property his own properties being
[04:25.820 --> 04:33.140]  invaded by 25 gang members all he does is gets a gun tells them to go away
[04:33.140 --> 04:39.780]  shoots four rounds into the lawn and Greer is the one arrested a damning

[08:05.380 --> 08:10.740]  say he crossed the line by firing a high powered AK-47 into his lawn CBS 2's
[08:10.740 --> 08:15.940]  Pablo Guzman has more on the protection controversy Sunday night George Greer
[08:15.940 --> 08:19.860]  says he had to use his rifle to stop what he thought was going to be an
[08:19.860 --> 08:23.860]  invasion of his Uniondale Long Island home by a gang he thought might have
[08:23.860 --> 08:29.300]  been the vicious MS-13 as he was about to drive his cousin home I went around
[08:29.300 --> 08:34.820]  and went into the house ran upstairs told my wife called the police they're
[08:34.820 --> 08:38.100]  trying to you know they're trying to attack Greer says the five men dared
[08:38.100 --> 08:41.820]  him to use the gun and that their shouts brought another larger group of gang
[08:41.820 --> 08:45.820]  members in front of his house he's you know start threatening my family my
[08:45.820 --> 08:49.420]  life oh you're dead you're dead I'm gonna kill you you know your family your
[08:49.420 --> 08:55.540]  babies you're dead so when he says that 20 other guys come rushing around the
[08:55.540 --> 09:01.380]  corner and so I fired up four warning shots Greer was later arrested John
[09:01.380 --> 09:05.660]  Lewis is George Greer's attorney what he's initially charged with the deep
[09:05.660 --> 09:09.780]  family reckless endangerment requires a depraved indifference to human life
[09:09.780 --> 09:14.540]  creating a risk that somebody's gonna die shooting into a lawn doesn't create
[09:14.540 --> 09:18.740]  a risk of anybody dying Greer says he knew Nassau County police employed the
[09:18.740 --> 09:22.540]  high-tech shot spotter technology in his area and that the shooting would bring
[09:22.540 --> 09:27.140]  police in minutes cops told me he was very cooperative Greer also said he was
[09:27.140 --> 09:31.500]  afraid the gang outside his house with the dreaded MS-13 and Nassau County
[09:31.500 --> 09:37.060]  Lieutenant Andrew Mulrain head of the gang unit says MS-13 has 2,000 members
[09:37.060 --> 09:41.460]  in the county most organized gang that we encounter on a daily basis you might
[09:41.460 --> 09:45.500]  think a person has the right to defend their home but the law says physical
[09:45.500 --> 09:50.540]  force can only be used to stop physical force Greer says he never saw anyone
[09:50.540 --> 09:55.060]  pull out a gun so a court will have to decide whether he was right in firing
[09:55.060 --> 09:59.700]  his gun even into the ground police determined Greer had the gun legally he
[09:59.700 --> 10:04.460]  has no criminal record and so he was not charged for the weapon from Union Dale
[10:04.460 --> 10:07.780]  Long Island hobble goose man
[10:07.780 --> 10:23.660]  so there we have it ladies and gentlemen arrested for defending its home against
[10:23.660 --> 10:29.140]  gang members who threatened to kill his wife and kids I mean why are the police
[10:29.140 --> 10:33.220]  arresting the victims of crime in America they want us all you know
[10:33.220 --> 10:37.340]  cowering in our homes twitching our curtains frightened to stand up to these
[10:37.340 --> 10:43.580]  thugs and when George Greer gets his gun and does the old you know Clint Eastwood
[10:43.580 --> 10:49.300]  Gran Torino act get off my lawn he's the one arrested what do you think about
[10:49.300 --> 10:55.820]  this I want to know what you think the the number to call in is 800 259 92 31
[10:55.820 --> 11:03.540]  that's 800 259 92 31 so get your calls lined up and the question I'm posing
[11:03.540 --> 11:09.340]  today is this how far away is America from becoming like where I live in
[11:09.340 --> 11:15.180]  Britain where only the criminals are allowed to own guns where even if you
[11:15.180 --> 11:20.460]  have so much as a knife and threaten to defend yourself then you're the one
[11:20.460 --> 11:26.260]  questioned by police not the people who break into your house or intrude onto
[11:26.260 --> 11:31.660]  your property in fact there was a case recently in England where this gang
[11:31.660 --> 11:38.380]  broke into a TV presenter's garden and then start to smash in a shed and she
[11:38.380 --> 11:44.300]  was alone in the house with just a baby and all she did was wave a knife at them
[11:44.300 --> 11:49.420]  through the window to try and scare them away this is a you know 28 year old
[11:49.420 --> 11:54.980]  woman on her own in the house with a baby the police turn up and question her
[11:54.980 --> 12:00.940]  the victim and then tell her that it's illegal to carry an offensive weapon
[12:00.940 --> 12:06.900]  even in her own home so she was basically told that you're not allowed to
[12:06.900 --> 12:12.540]  defend yourself in your own home with a kitchen knife you know that's what are
[12:12.540 --> 12:17.140]  we supposed to do just lay down and get stabbed to death I mean what was George
[12:17.140 --> 12:21.820]  Greer supposed to do just let you know 25 gang members kill his wife and kids as
[12:21.820 --> 12:27.620]  they said they would you know a man's home is his castle I mean England is
[12:27.620 --> 12:32.940]  where that term originated but now in England and this is if this is allowed
[12:32.940 --> 12:40.060]  to stand and become the president not only will an Englishman's home not be
[12:40.060 --> 12:43.780]  a castle but you won't even be able to threaten to defend yourself never mind
[12:43.780 --> 12:51.460]  actually defend yourself God forbid now from my perspective this is about more
[12:51.460 --> 12:55.900]  than just you know removing the tools removing the weapons of self-defense
[12:55.900 --> 13:01.620]  it's about destroying the very thought that you have the right to self-defense
[13:01.620 --> 13:09.100]  this is about victimhood and creating this sense of oppression that we can't
[13:09.100 --> 13:13.860]  resist that we can't even stand up to the gang-banging thugs that threaten our
[13:13.860 --> 13:17.900]  family's lives so if we're not going to stand up to them how on earth can we
[13:17.900 --> 13:22.540]  stand up to anyone in any position of authority and I mean what are the
[13:22.540 --> 13:28.060]  consequences what are the consequences of the police treating the victims as the
[13:28.060 --> 13:34.140]  criminals and letting the violent criminals go free it creates a clock
[13:34.140 --> 13:39.860]  work orange society the real criminals are emboldened you know every time a
[13:39.860 --> 13:45.020]  burglar breaks into a house in the United Kingdom they do so safely in the
[13:45.020 --> 13:47.860]  knowledge that they're never going to be you know staring down the end of a
[13:47.860 --> 13:54.220]  barrel so I mean the most deadly weapon I've got to defend myself is a pathetic
[13:54.220 --> 14:00.260]  little baseball bat if someone walks in here right now with a gun I'm dead
[14:00.260 --> 14:05.540]  because only the criminals are allowed to own them they pass the laws that
[14:05.540 --> 14:11.260]  disarm innocent people who would only ever use guns to defend themselves since
[14:11.260 --> 14:15.260]  you know criminals by their very nature don't follow laws then they're the only
[14:15.260 --> 14:20.860]  ones that have access to guns anymore a gun ban only ensures that the victims
[14:20.860 --> 14:25.900]  are disarmed and the figures for the United Kingdom back that up since hand
[14:25.900 --> 14:32.100]  gun was well handguns were banned in 1997 the rate of violent crime in the
[14:32.100 --> 14:38.820]  United Kingdom doubled and it has continued to climb ever since but I
[14:38.820 --> 14:43.180]  mean this precedent is going to be set in America the supposed home of gun
[14:43.180 --> 14:46.860]  rights and the Second Amendment you know the Second Amendment it's not just
[14:46.860 --> 14:51.820]  about duck hunting it's about protecting your family but they want to
[14:51.820 --> 14:57.500]  restrict the use and exercise of the Second Amendment so they can whittle it
[14:57.500 --> 15:01.900]  down one piece at a time you know like Bill Clinton said it's like eating an
[15:01.900 --> 15:07.980]  elephant you've got to do it one little piece at a time so you know maybe
[15:07.980 --> 15:12.140]  George Greer should have just thanked the gang members for threatening to kill
[15:12.140 --> 15:17.060]  his wife and kids and you know offered them lemonade or something he offended
[15:17.060 --> 15:20.860]  them it's like the case of the TV presenter that I just talked about in
[15:20.860 --> 15:24.980]  England she offended the people who had stormed her property by waving the
[15:24.980 --> 15:35.900]  knife so she was the victim now notice in the clip they also say that although
[15:35.900 --> 15:43.620]  this gun was legally owned and registered by Mr. George Greer that he was
[15:43.620 --> 15:49.980]  still investigated regarding the gun they said you know words to the effect
[15:49.980 --> 15:55.620]  that the police looked into the gun and it was okay like they would even need to
[15:55.620 --> 16:00.940]  look into it once they knew that it was a legally registered firearm it says if
[16:00.940 --> 16:04.660]  you know displaying a gun that you legally own on your own property some
[16:04.660 --> 16:08.980]  kind of suspicious act worthy of suspicion within itself worthy of
[16:08.980 --> 16:16.180]  investigation and the way they're going to apply this law I mean this is going to
[16:16.180 --> 16:20.940]  court this is going to go in front of a jury if this is allowed to stand and
[16:20.940 --> 16:28.820]  George Greer is convicted of a crime for defending his own property then it
[16:28.820 --> 16:33.020]  sends a message it sends a very clear message to the you know dumbed down
[16:33.020 --> 16:38.580]  Prozac head stupefied public that if you dare trying and defend yourself in any
[16:38.580 --> 16:44.060]  manner if you even think about it then you'll be the one doing hard time not a
[16:44.060 --> 16:50.300]  25 gang members threatening to kill your family so they're saying yeah you know
[16:50.300 --> 16:54.740]  you can have your second amendment we won't take that away just yet but don't
[16:54.740 --> 16:59.380]  you dare try to exercise it in protecting your kids or your wife because
[16:59.380 --> 17:06.540]  we're going to come down hard so I want to hear what you think about this let's
[17:06.540 --> 17:11.740]  start going to the calls now what do you think a man defends his home against
[17:11.740 --> 17:17.380]  25 gang members with a legally owned firearm doesn't shoot them merely shoots
[17:17.380 --> 17:22.540]  four warning shots please turn up he's the one arrested is that how the second
[17:22.540 --> 17:26.580]  amendment stands is that the state of the second amendment now in America let's
[17:26.580 --> 17:31.020]  see what you think we're going to our first caller Jeffrey in Missouri Jeffrey
[17:31.020 --> 17:40.180]  go ahead hello yeah Jeffrey go ahead yeah sounds a lot like they're trying to take
[17:40.180 --> 17:43.660]  away the second amendment and giving you a reason why well you don't even need in
[17:43.660 --> 17:48.140]  the first place you can't defend yourself so what do you need the second
[17:48.140 --> 17:52.940]  amendment for well exactly I mean when seconds count the police are always
[17:52.940 --> 17:57.220]  minutes away aren't they I mean is that what they're saying just just wait 30
[17:57.220 --> 18:01.020]  minutes for the police to turn up while these gang members mow you down I mean
[18:01.020 --> 18:06.020]  what are people supposed to do all the figures show that the response times for
[18:06.020 --> 18:10.900]  police they're just getting longer and longer so you know what people supposed
[18:10.900 --> 18:16.420]  to do just wait let's go to our next call Parker in Illinois Parker what do you
[18:16.420 --> 18:23.900]  think about this yes you're on there go ahead all right I didn't have a comment
[18:23.900 --> 18:28.540]  about this specifically but I just wrote a book and basically what it comes down
[18:28.540 --> 18:33.300]  to is every possible way to defeat the new world order the globalists and stuff
[18:33.300 --> 18:37.540]  like that so like because I've been researching this since like I was 13
[18:37.540 --> 18:41.860]  three years ago I've taken everything that I learned and put it into one book
[18:41.860 --> 18:47.980]  and I've just finished uploading it for free on the internet because like I
[18:47.980 --> 18:52.260]  honestly believe that if everybody had like if everybody read this book then
[18:52.260 --> 18:56.180]  we could easily fix around or fix up everything that we're having and like
[18:56.180 --> 19:01.420]  completely turn everything around okay send me an email I'll maybe post it on
[19:01.420 --> 19:07.340]  the website Jason in Georgia Jason you're on the air go ahead I was a man
[19:07.340 --> 19:13.460]  just want to say I appreciate everything you're doing first time caller but I
[19:13.460 --> 19:18.260]  think it's just ridiculous that they even came to the guy's house to arrest
[19:18.260 --> 19:23.340]  him just absurd real quick though the writings of Samuel Jackson have here I
[19:23.340 --> 19:26.700]  found in the email the other day among the natural rights of the colonists are
[19:26.700 --> 19:32.020]  these first they write to life secondly the liberty thirdly to property
[19:32.020 --> 19:37.660]  together with the right to support and defend them in the best manner they can
[19:37.660 --> 19:41.980]  that was some of the writings of Samuel Jackson long time ago so I mean if they
[19:41.980 --> 19:46.300]  can see the stuff that we're doing now back then then how can they not know what
[19:46.300 --> 19:52.260]  we are looking forward to in the unfortunate future that's right they're

[24:35.100 --> 24:41.580]  four rounds into his lawn and is then arrested by police why a police in
[24:41.580 --> 24:46.540]  America being trained that average Americans who still have some semblance
[24:46.540 --> 24:51.900]  of a backbone are their real enemies I mean what can we do to make sure you
[24:51.900 --> 24:57.540]  know this remains an isolated case and the precedent isn't set that defending
[24:57.540 --> 25:05.700]  yourself in America is a crime like it already is basically set in England do
[25:05.700 --> 25:09.300]  you want to end up like the UK where carrying a kitchen knife in your own
[25:09.300 --> 25:19.420]  home is considered an illegal act 800 259 92 31 now compare what happened in
[25:19.420 --> 25:23.820]  Long Island to this example out of Oklahoma which we're gonna play in a
[25:23.820 --> 25:28.980]  second a woman alone in a house with a crazy man banging on the door and then
[25:28.980 --> 25:32.860]  he starts to break in the woman's on the phone with police and she tells them
[25:32.860 --> 25:38.060]  she doesn't want to kill this guy but I'm going to have to play the clip there's
[25:38.060 --> 25:43.500]  a man at my back door he's trying to get in he's hollering yelling okay and you
[25:43.500 --> 25:51.140]  have a gun I guess I do I do not have it out I want you to stay on the line
[25:51.140 --> 25:56.100]  with me I will he is banging on the door
[26:01.100 --> 26:05.500]  looks like an older man but I don't know I don't understand what's going on he's
[26:05.500 --> 26:09.500]  getting close to the door I'm gonna go I can get the gun out it's a shotgun it's
[26:09.500 --> 26:16.940]  large can you understand what he's saying at all well he's crazy he's crazy
[26:16.940 --> 26:23.740]  I'm taking the safety off the gun man he's acting crazy okay do you have life
[26:23.740 --> 26:29.780]  that you can go inside your house and lock yourself in a room I've got a big
[26:29.780 --> 26:33.820]  shotgun I'm not going into a tiny bathroom oh crap he's at the back okay
[26:33.820 --> 26:37.940]  county 13 is advising that you can defend your property if you need to I
[26:37.940 --> 26:41.460]  don't want to have to kill this man but I'll kill him great they're dead man I
[26:41.460 --> 26:46.100]  understand all right he's breaking in now he's breaking in on him he's being
[26:46.100 --> 26:50.260]  older man I don't want to kill him God I don't want to kill this okay they need
[26:50.260 --> 26:56.180]  to hurry he's gonna break this and help it he does I have to kill him man I
[26:56.180 --> 27:02.620]  don't want to kill him I understand man you have to protect yourself I will man
[27:02.620 --> 27:09.140]  and they got through the house I'm gonna shoot can you oh my god
[27:11.260 --> 27:16.900]  man is your father I thought I'm going out front I hit him
[27:16.900 --> 27:27.620]  God help me oh please there's God I think I've killed him I'm so sorry father it's okay man it's okay you
[27:27.620 --> 27:34.860]  you have to protect yourself okay you have to protect yourself you have to
[27:34.860 --> 27:39.540]  protect your property that's in Oklahoma and the police should be commended for
[27:39.540 --> 27:43.980]  their response in simply you know annunciate in the fact that that's the
[27:43.980 --> 27:48.940]  case but not apparently anymore in Long Island where this guy who didn't even
[27:48.940 --> 27:53.940]  shoot at these 25 gang members didn't even aim the gun at them merely let off
[27:53.940 --> 28:00.180]  four rounds into his own lawn was then arrested by police is this the turning
[28:00.180 --> 28:05.580]  point for America where the idea of self-defense is flushed down the toilet
[28:05.580 --> 28:09.100]  like in England where if you wave a knife in the window then you're the one
[28:09.100 --> 28:13.620]  who's going to be investigated and the gang that's breaking into your house is
[28:13.620 --> 28:19.020]  let off scott-free I mean just look at what happened to George Harrison the
[28:19.020 --> 28:23.340]  famous Beatle and his wife you know this nutcase breaks into their house he's
[28:23.340 --> 28:29.540]  got this delusion that he's somehow the disciple of George Harrison you repeated
[28:29.540 --> 28:33.820]  the stabs Harrison in the chest and then his wife's running around with this
[28:33.820 --> 28:39.140]  fireplace poker and the base of a lamp trying to bash this murderer on the
[28:39.140 --> 28:46.180]  head and Harrison at one stage thinks it's over nearly killed him the knife
[28:46.180 --> 28:50.740]  went right into his chest he said he could feel the blood running up to his
[28:50.740 --> 28:56.100]  mouth very nearly killed him because he was in England he didn't have a gun he
[28:56.100 --> 29:02.300]  couldn't defend himself a man's home is his castle is that really gonna be the
[29:02.300 --> 29:08.940]  case after this incident with George Greer who didn't face one man he faced
[29:08.940 --> 29:14.420]  25 men who ran on to his property and said they wanted to kill his wife and
[29:14.420 --> 29:20.660]  kids and the police only responded when they detected Greer had fired his
[29:20.660 --> 29:27.140]  gun so he was subsequently arrested merely for protecting his property and
[29:27.140 --> 29:32.900]  protect protecting his wife and kids now after the break we're gonna get into the
[29:32.900 --> 29:41.260]  handgun ban in Britain and delve into how that one worked out for a violent
[29:41.260 --> 29:46.220]  crime and gun crime now that in England only the criminals are allowed to own
[29:46.220 --> 29:52.940]  guns stay tuned this is the Alex Jones show we're on the march the empires on

[33:25.700 --> 33:30.660]  George Greer wasn't kind enough to the 25 gang members that invaded his
[33:30.660 --> 33:35.860]  property and threatened to kill his kids George Greer was the one who police
[33:35.860 --> 33:40.700]  arrested we're gonna go rapid fire through your calls on the Alex Jones
[33:40.700 --> 33:45.660]  show what do you think about this we've got tyranny rival in California you are
[33:45.660 --> 33:53.940]  on the air go ahead yes hello first-time caller been listening for a couple
[33:53.940 --> 33:59.940]  months now been waking up but on this subject there is there's something
[33:59.940 --> 34:03.660]  similar I've listened to in the past here in California because I used to watch
[34:03.660 --> 34:08.820]  mainstream media there's something similar to where a burglar broke into
[34:08.820 --> 34:14.140]  someone's home and the person shot the person in the leg just to you know
[34:14.140 --> 34:18.460]  injure them so the police can come and then the person that got shot in the
[34:18.460 --> 34:26.940]  leg the burglar went to court and sued the homeowner and basically that person
[34:26.940 --> 34:31.220]  obviously won and there was another incident where the person killed that
[34:31.220 --> 34:37.220]  family member or the killed the robber and then the family press charges against
[34:37.220 --> 34:45.940]  the homeowner but I mean yeah I mean that there are cases where a burglar has
[34:45.940 --> 34:50.340]  come in through a skylight and hurt himself and then the homeowners get
[34:50.340 --> 34:55.540]  sued because the skylight was improperly built to allow the burglar to come in
[34:55.540 --> 35:00.140]  and rob them so I guess what you know just lay down and die that's what the
[35:00.140 --> 35:04.060]  government's telling us we can't defend ourselves our homes not our castle
[35:04.060 --> 35:09.820]  anymore just stay frightened stay peeking behind the curtain don't worry

[35:46.260 --> 35:50.100]  the entire public if somebody like me can figure this out you know somebody in
[35:50.100 --> 35:54.980]  their position should be able to figure that out of course they know it you know
[35:54.980 --> 35:58.860]  and I also commend that woman you know for calling the police while the man's
[35:58.860 --> 36:03.100]  beating on the back door if he had been beating on my back door you know the
[36:03.100 --> 36:08.140]  cops get called after he's laying on the ground you know and it's ridiculous
[36:08.140 --> 36:12.820]  it's ridiculous to have to who's going to abide by a gun law that means law
[36:12.820 --> 36:20.460]  abiding citizens abide by the law obey the law right perfect sense there anyway
[36:20.460 --> 36:25.900]  I'm hearing stuff like that makes me want to vent you know 25 people in your
[36:25.900 --> 36:30.700]  yard in cops get called if they're my yard they're in a pile before I even
[36:30.700 --> 36:35.500]  think about calling the cops anyway that's exactly right I mean it's not
[36:35.500 --> 36:40.300]  just the fact that they were on his yard they were screaming and threatening to
[36:40.300 --> 36:45.620]  kill his wife and kids and he didn't eat I mean 99% of people would have shot him
[36:45.620 --> 36:50.020]  in the head you unloaded four rounds into his own lawn and apparently that was
[36:50.020 --> 36:55.340]  an overreaction that was recklessness so I mean if this is allowed to become the
[36:55.340 --> 36:59.460]  precedent then you're going to end up worse than England where people can't
[36:59.460 --> 37:06.020]  even carry knives in their own home Matt in the UK you're on the air go ahead
[37:07.180 --> 37:14.020]  hello Matt are you there yeah go ahead well I doing yeah yeah my question
[37:14.020 --> 37:17.860]  basically you mentioned about this obviously this gun to now in America
[37:17.860 --> 37:22.340]  just from the British point of view I read in the mail paper today and the guy
[37:22.340 --> 37:26.460]  in the UK it basically been found with military shells and guns but obviously
[37:26.460 --> 37:29.700]  they're all legal above board and it's going to show you how they're making
[37:29.700 --> 37:34.060]  press a few mongering in this country now and making such a big hierarchy thing
[37:34.060 --> 37:37.380]  about guns you know three months in the British public what do you agree on that
[37:37.380 --> 37:44.060]  one yeah well they've been doing it since at least the early 90s and then the
[37:44.060 --> 37:48.940]  mid 90s with the Hamilton Dunn-Blainshoe and which has some very strange
[37:48.940 --> 37:53.740]  connections and of course if those teachers during the Dunn-Blain massacre
[37:53.740 --> 37:56.980]  would have been allowed to be armed then a lot less people would have died
[37:56.980 --> 38:04.700]  that prompted the 97 gun ban in the UK and since 97 the rate of violent crime in
[38:04.700 --> 38:10.180]  the UK has doubled why because criminals can now act safe in the knowledge that
[38:10.180 --> 38:14.420]  nobody can defend themselves I mean this is why your chances are getting mugged
[38:14.420 --> 38:19.700]  in London a six times higher than major cities in the United States there's
[38:19.700 --> 38:25.060]  another stat that I came across while doing the research for this 53% of
[38:25.060 --> 38:29.900]  English burglaries occur while occupants occupants are at home compared to
[38:29.900 --> 38:36.220]  13% in the US why is that because the burglars the criminals know that the
[38:36.220 --> 38:39.700]  majority of people in the United States are going to blow them away if they come
[38:39.700 --> 38:44.580]  in the house in England safe in the knowledge you can go in try to kill
[38:44.580 --> 38:49.780]  people, burble them and then often is the case the victim is going to get
[38:49.780 --> 38:54.300]  charged and that's how there have been many cases of that in Britain that we've
[38:54.300 --> 38:58.100]  covered over the years on the Alex Jones show and I talked about one earlier
[38:58.100 --> 39:02.300]  today so thanks for the call Matt we're going to go to Barry in Arizona Barry
[39:02.300 --> 39:08.420]  you're on the air. Hey Paul this is an opportunity for people to kind of study
[39:08.420 --> 39:13.380]  you know the psychology of government in general because this whole trend of
[39:13.380 --> 39:21.580]  blaming the victim is particular to people that are either sociopathic or
[39:21.580 --> 39:27.060]  antisocial I've been making the case for a long time that government is
[39:27.060 --> 39:34.140]  antisocial and sociopathic. Oh no that's a that's a common trait especially with
[39:34.140 --> 39:39.380]  people like serial killers who will often blame the victim for their crime
[39:39.380 --> 39:44.460]  it's like we were talking about Charlie Manson yesterday Manson absolves his
[39:44.460 --> 39:48.980]  blame in the murders of Tate and Labianca and all his followers did at the
[39:48.980 --> 39:53.100]  time because they said that it was you know necessary to kill people for the
[39:53.100 --> 39:57.900]  environment and that it was part of a war and that is a classic sociopathic
[39:57.900 --> 40:02.620]  trait among serial killers to blame the victim so now our own government to
[40:02.620 --> 40:08.220]  exercise that psychological illness in their war against the people we're gonna
[40:08.220 --> 40:14.620]  move on yeah go ahead it's a constant theme running through government and
[40:14.620 --> 40:18.940]  people can you know once they realize this then they can see government for
[40:18.940 --> 40:26.980]  what it really is and you know anyway that's all I have to say that's right
[40:26.980 --> 40:31.260]  it's feeding on us it's feeding on us and to make it easier to do so we have
[40:31.260 --> 40:37.000]  to be defenseless Robert in California you're on the air go ahead mr. Paul
[40:37.000 --> 40:43.020]  Joseph Watson I heard from my butler has informed me of the serious issue of the
[40:43.020 --> 40:45.900]  man not being part of the rural Admiralty
[40:45.900 --> 40:52.020]  certainly it does not have no sir after his name will you will not get justice
[40:52.020 --> 40:58.380]  no sir no sovereign entities such as mr. Greer and the gang members will ever
[40:58.380 --> 41:04.260]  receive justice because you see the bankers considered them more of a threat
[41:04.260 --> 41:12.460]  than any non-armed citizen that makes sense it makes perfect sense the accent
[41:12.460 --> 41:14.980]  doesn't know because I live at the opposite end of the country to where
[41:14.980 --> 41:19.620]  you'll hear that accent thanks for the call Matt in Minnesota you're on the air
[41:19.620 --> 41:25.660]  go ahead hey I just want to point out that when the when the media uses you
[41:25.660 --> 41:30.100]  know terms like AK-47 to describe the weapon the fire on that guy had that's
[41:30.100 --> 41:35.300]  just sort of a way to demonize firearms you know to the the commoners and the
[41:35.300 --> 41:40.220]  slaves because when they when people hear you know the word AK-47 which it
[41:40.220 --> 41:44.620]  probably wasn't an AK-47 it was probably just a copy of semi-automatic
[41:44.620 --> 41:49.940]  rifle and you know they use that term so people are like ooh you know this guy
[41:49.940 --> 41:53.540]  had an AK-47 why did he have that why did he fire that and you know what I
[41:53.540 --> 41:59.060]  mean yeah that's exactly the case they focus on the fact that he had a gun I
[41:59.060 --> 42:03.220]  mean that's what the majority of the stories about in fact on the CBS news
[42:03.220 --> 42:10.420]  story there's a picture above the news story of a row of AK-47s as if this guy
[42:10.420 --> 42:14.900]  was packing some you know military grade arsenal of weapons when it's got
[42:14.900 --> 42:18.500]  nothing to do with his gun it's about the fact that he tried to defend himself
[42:18.500 --> 42:24.340]  and was arrested I mean look at Switzerland most of the populations
[42:24.340 --> 42:30.100]  packing AK-47s and Switzerland has one of the lowest gun crime rates in the
[42:30.100 --> 42:34.460]  world the gun crime rate in Switzerland is so low that they don't even keep
[42:34.460 --> 42:39.820]  statistics for it and that's because in Switzerland owning guns is rooted in the
[42:39.820 --> 42:44.100]  culture in fact the government in Switzerland runs all the shooting
[42:44.100 --> 42:48.580]  classes and all the training you know is almost illegal not to have a gun in
[42:48.580 --> 42:54.900]  Switzerland and what's the result gun crime figures lowest in the world I mean
[42:54.900 --> 42:59.540]  look at the Nazi occupation look at the map of the countries that the Nazis
[42:59.540 --> 43:04.340]  occupied during the Second World War in Central and Northern Europe you'll see a
[43:04.340 --> 43:09.300]  big swath of it all circled round colored red and there's one little area
[43:09.300 --> 43:14.420]  that's a different color and that country is Switzerland why because one of the
[43:14.420 --> 43:19.380]  primary reasons Hitler was afraid to invade is the fact that he knew the vast
[43:19.380 --> 43:24.340]  majority of the population were armed and that the Swiss are a citizen army
[43:24.340 --> 43:30.220]  their their population is their army now the people in the Warsaw ghetto didn't
[43:30.220 --> 43:34.420]  have guns because they were immediately disarmed when the Nazis moved in what
[43:34.420 --> 43:38.620]  was the first thing that the Nazis did when they occupied a new country rise
[43:38.620 --> 43:44.740]  and fall of the Third Reich read it Austria Czechoslovakia Poland they
[43:44.740 --> 43:49.900]  disarmed the population that was the first thing they did and in the United
[43:49.900 --> 43:54.340]  Kingdom where also we come in a disarmed population we've been disarmed of our
[43:54.340 --> 43:59.220]  firearms now we're being told we can't carry knives and then you get a story
[43:59.220 --> 44:05.060]  like this George Greer incident in Long Island and that's why I'm asking the
[44:05.060 --> 44:11.540]  question you know is the Second Amendment dead the man's home is his
[44:11.540 --> 44:15.340]  castle is that idea now being thrown out in America we're going to move on to our
[44:15.340 --> 44:21.100]  next caller which is Robert's in California Robert you're on the air go
[44:21.100 --> 44:27.980]  ahead oh sorry Matt in Minnesota Matt go ahead
[44:27.980 --> 44:35.420]  Michael in Sweden you're the next caller go ahead hi Paul I do today hi how are
[44:35.420 --> 44:41.740]  you um I think it's outrageous that the Long Island man got arrested for
[44:41.740 --> 44:51.700]  defending his property and his family of this notorious MS 13 gang you know it
[44:51.700 --> 44:56.780]  is outrageous and I mean what's the situation is in Sweden I'm guessing
[44:56.780 --> 45:01.580]  that Sweden is a largely disarmed country or is it more like Switzerland tell
[45:01.580 --> 45:07.500]  me about the gun control laws in Sweden you have to have a special license in
[45:07.500 --> 45:12.380]  order to get a gun or a rifle here in Sweden we are probably the most disarmed
[45:12.380 --> 45:20.420]  people in northern Europe I believe and I don't know really if we're gonna if the
[45:20.420 --> 45:25.220]  people even care about gun laws here because the all the more people are
[45:25.220 --> 45:30.860]  going to prison for life sentences you know for murder and stuff and they I
[45:30.860 --> 45:34.340]  don't know really if the politicians are going to bring this up with because we
[45:34.340 --> 45:37.180]  have a general election coming up here in September and I don't know if they
[45:37.180 --> 45:43.580]  are gonna take up this issue because I feel it's very important you know yeah
[45:43.580 --> 45:47.740]  I mean just look at the example of Switzerland as I just said they don't
[45:47.740 --> 45:51.380]  even keep records anymore because the gun crimes so low but everywhere else you
[45:51.380 --> 45:56.260]  look in Europe some areas of France will allow you to have a hunting rifle
[45:56.260 --> 45:59.980]  which is why a lot of British people are moving down there one of the primary
[45:59.980 --> 46:03.740]  reasons because there's a little bit more freedom but generally across Europe
[46:03.740 --> 46:09.380]  the laws are harmonized in line with you know some of the most draconian gun
[46:09.380 --> 46:14.180]  laws on the planet which is why violent crime is constantly increasing
[46:14.180 --> 46:20.380]  talking about Switzerland we're gonna go to a clip which perfectly discusses and
[46:20.380 --> 46:26.820]  exemplifies why the country has such a low gun crime rate because the majority
[46:26.820 --> 46:30.820]  of the people own guns and are encouraged to do so by the government
[46:30.820 --> 46:36.780]  itself what so let's go to that clip where the gun control situation or lack
[46:36.780 --> 46:42.300]  of it the gun ownership situation in Switzerland is exemplified let's go to
[46:42.300 --> 46:50.740]  that clip now this is a sig 550 it's designed to destroy anything standing
[46:50.740 --> 46:57.620]  within its 400 meter trajectory and there are over 500,000 of them kept in
[46:57.620 --> 47:03.460]  Swiss homes guns and shooting are a strong Swiss tradition basic military
[47:03.460 --> 47:07.780]  training is mandatory for young men and afterwards they're required to keep their
[47:07.780 --> 47:13.420]  weapon at home Mark Heim is a Titrina representative for the lobby group
[47:13.420 --> 47:24.900]  protel basically this was my father's military rifle and of course he got to
[47:24.900 --> 47:29.820]  keep it when he was finished I have my grandfather's rifle in the office hanging
[47:29.820 --> 47:37.180]  on the wall this was mine when I did service just quite an old one it was
[47:37.180 --> 47:48.380]  introduced in 1957 was used until 1990 and this is my son's that's the current
[47:48.380 --> 47:54.380]  model that's what's being used today that's what we'll be using to shoot the
[47:54.380 --> 47:59.620]  felchieson today the Felchieson or Tiro Federale in Campania as it's known in
[47:59.620 --> 48:04.140]  these parts is an annual Swiss event and it's also the largest shooting festival
[48:04.140 --> 48:09.100]  in the world roughly 200,000 people come up to target practice all across the
[48:09.100 --> 48:14.820]  country ammunition is provided by the government Heim goes regularly to this
[48:14.820 --> 48:21.620]  range and it's often a family affair it was organized by the government to have
[48:21.620 --> 48:27.300]  a very high state of red readiness for this with military and population the
[48:27.300 --> 48:30.540]  target has always been that within 24 to 48 hours
[48:30.540 --> 48:35.660]  Switzerland could mobilize a pretty large army I mean even by European
[48:35.660 --> 48:38.060]  standards
[48:41.940 --> 48:46.500]  but it wasn't the militia that sparked Heim's interest in Guns of the young man
[48:46.500 --> 48:52.580]  it was an unassuming trip to a Holocaust museum I was going through all the
[48:52.580 --> 48:58.300]  exhibits and the soap and the lampshades made of people's skin and while I was
[48:58.300 --> 49:06.060]  looking I heard a funny noise and there was an old woman maybe two meters from
[49:06.060 --> 49:13.700]  me and she was trying not to cry she was sort of sobbing very quietly she was
[49:13.700 --> 49:16.140]  holding it back if she had been a few meters further away I wouldn't have
[49:16.140 --> 49:21.060]  heard her and she obviously had gone through that that's when the whole
[49:21.060 --> 49:28.260]  impact of it hit me and I promised myself I would never be in her situation I
[49:28.260 --> 49:35.140]  will I would want to be free never in a situation where somebody could you know
[49:35.140 --> 49:42.100]  march us off to ovens or prisons or just take away our freedom the key to freedom
[49:42.100 --> 49:46.180]  is the ability to be able to defend yourself and if you don't have the
[49:46.180 --> 49:52.420]  tools to do that then you are at the mercy of whoever wants to put your way and
[49:52.420 --> 49:55.860]  the tools for that
[49:57.020 --> 50:02.100]  there you have it in Switzerland the ability to defend yourself is the key
[50:02.100 --> 50:07.100]  to freedom in a country where the government itself runs all the firearms
[50:07.100 --> 50:13.580]  training classes where there's two million Swiss citizens who are armed out
[50:13.580 --> 50:18.060]  of a population of about six million and they've got the lowest gun crime rate
[50:18.060 --> 50:22.140]  in the world this is the reason why Hitler refused to invade Switzerland
[50:22.140 --> 50:25.820]  because he knew he'd have a hell of a fight on his hands when every other
[50:25.820 --> 50:30.340]  country around it had been occupied and the first thing that Hitler did was to
[50:30.340 --> 50:34.940]  disarm the local populations we're gonna be back with some more your calls we
[50:34.940 --> 50:39.460]  got Gerald Salente coming up in the second hour but stay there Gus Ruth

[51:04.380 --> 51:08.340]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that
[51:08.340 --> 51:11.980]  in a real meltdown non hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or
[51:11.980 --> 51:15.380]  gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this
[51:15.380 --> 51:19.140]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at
[51:19.140 --> 51:23.580]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non hybrid seeds they

[54:17.660 --> 54:23.140]  you've taken the red pill it's the Alex Jones show on Wednesday September 8th
[54:23.140 --> 54:28.060]  2010 and we're talking about George Greer this man who tried to defend himself
[54:28.060 --> 54:34.260]  against 25 gang members in Long Island and the police ended up arresting the
[54:34.260 --> 54:38.620]  victim once again we're going back to your calls Ruth in Louisiana Ruth you're
[54:38.620 --> 54:47.500]  on the air go ahead turn your audio off Ruth just talk to me on
[54:47.500 --> 54:54.620]  yes thank you so much for you and Alex I always have you in my prayers I really
[54:54.620 --> 55:00.940]  do believe that the people have a right to protect their property and to protect
[55:00.940 --> 55:06.580]  their family and as far as George Greer is concerned any other people in this
[55:06.580 --> 55:11.980]  country they're falsely accused by the police department and the governor of
[55:11.980 --> 55:20.540]  that state we need to start calling and demanding that we're not going to put up
[55:20.540 --> 55:25.820]  with this type of situation with the people and get behind the people
[55:25.820 --> 55:33.500]  themselves I really do believe that that's what we need to do I mean I mean
[55:33.500 --> 55:38.540]  where's the NRA on this I mean if they come out with a statement I don't see it
[55:38.540 --> 55:42.500]  on their website so I mean are they going to come out in defense of George
[55:42.500 --> 55:49.340]  Greer for being arrested for defending his home Dennis in Texas go ahead well
[55:49.340 --> 55:55.020]  thank you thank you for taking my call I agree with Ruth in Louisiana there the
[55:55.020 --> 55:59.860]  number one priority or the number one thing in the United States is the idea
[55:59.860 --> 56:05.740]  of personal property and you're ready to defend it okay without that you have
[56:05.740 --> 56:11.980]  nothing the economic system deteriorates and falls and you become a
[56:11.980 --> 56:18.140]  a victim of tyranny if you don't have the right to personal property if you
[56:18.140 --> 56:23.100]  don't have the right to defend it you have nothing the promise of America is
[56:23.100 --> 56:29.940]  gone now the one way to defend it is is the the other tools that the people
[56:29.940 --> 56:37.020]  are for our forefathers gave us they gave us the grand jury and the pettit
[56:37.020 --> 56:44.460]  jury tried to just try to convict someone in Ireland of going against the
[56:44.460 --> 56:48.700]  police that isn't going to happen and those those things should happen in the
[56:48.700 --> 56:53.180]  United States if someone is defending their home and their property and their
[56:53.180 --> 57:00.300]  family and they happen to exercise their right to to the Second Amendment and
[57:00.300 --> 57:08.140]  shoot intruders and and and defend themselves then they should demand a
[57:08.140 --> 57:13.940]  trial by jury and the jurors should go ahead and acquit these people if we
[57:13.940 --> 57:19.860]  don't want these tyrannical laws we need to acquit people we need to it to show
[57:19.860 --> 57:25.740]  the government that these laws are not in our best interest and we're not going
[57:25.740 --> 57:31.780]  to put up with them and then throw the bums out well that's right I mean it's
[57:31.780 --> 57:36.500]  interesting that you mentioned Ireland there because Northern Ireland in fact
[57:36.500 --> 57:42.700]  is the only part of the British Isles where you can still get a permit to own
[57:42.700 --> 57:46.860]  a handgun it's banned in Scotland England and Wales and the Republic of
[57:46.860 --> 57:51.900]  Ireland and again what's the result Northern Ireland has one of the lowest
[57:51.900 --> 57:58.100]  violent crime rates victimization rates amongst the top industrial countries in
[57:58.100 --> 58:01.460]  Europe and of course England has one of the highest because handguns are banned
[58:01.460 --> 58:05.740]  in Northern Ireland a criminal breaking into a home knows there's a reasonable
[58:05.740 --> 58:09.140]  chance that they're going to be looking down the end of a barrel so again same
[58:09.140 --> 58:14.820]  in Switzerland same everywhere more guns equals less crime and we're going to talk
[58:14.820 --> 58:20.420]  to Gerald Salente so get your calls lined up trends research Institute I'm

[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:54.060]  people tend to listen the fall of the Soviet Union the crash of 87 the panic
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:01:00.020]  of 08 the rise of the anti-tax movement and the Tea Party the great
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:05.740]  recession and now the greatest depression Gerald Salente and the trends
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:11.140]  research Institute predicted every one of them and many more years before they
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:16.780]  happen and now with times as fraught as these many people are turning to Gerald
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:22.340]  and the trends research Institute for advice on how they can prepare for the
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:27.780]  turmoil that's in the pipeline for the years ahead and the website is trends
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:37.460]  research.com get your calls lined up for Gerald 800 259 92 31 Gerald Salente
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:43.780]  welcome to the show today great to have you on Paul good to be on with you it's
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:50.260]  a pleasure now I want to cover a host of issues summer economic and I know that
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:55.740]  when Alex talks to you you mainly cover just economic ground but others are
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:59.700]  related to culture and immigration because some of our listeners may not be
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:03.540]  aware of the fact that the trends journal is about you know more than just
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:08.420]  financial forecasting it's about what we're going to see unfold in society in
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:15.580]  general in a myriad of different ways so on that note one one issue that we've
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:20.260]  been tracking here is the the seeming correlation between the collapse in
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:24.140]  America's global standing you know the collapse in the economy the housing
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:31.380]  market and society in general with the collapse in what we call moral standards
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:36.020]  and just the basic decency with which people use to treat each other and I
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:41.900]  think this manifests itself with the kind of dumbing down of our culture and the
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:47.060]  type of music and cultural valve values that the establishment puts out there
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:52.060]  that our young people are sucked into now in the latest trends journal one
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:56.500]  thing that caught my eye was how you talk about this quote thrill of the
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:01.180]  thuggish as you coin it and how it was going to be trumped over the next
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:06.580]  couple of years by a return to beauty and elegance in the creative arts and
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:10.780]  that's something that piqued my interest so can you expand Gerald and why you
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:16.620]  think this new trend will be born and how it will manifest itself in culture
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:22.500]  and society for those that understand that this has to be clearly one of the
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:29.500]  biggest money makers waiting out there to happen as you mentioned we've dumbed
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:36.220]  down to levels where we now have the president of the United States riffing
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:43.780]  on snooki so the country's become clearly snooki stupid and that if
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:48.940]  anybody and it's a trend forecaster it was a lot of things I don't like to do
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:55.980]  and one of them that I have to do is watch how stupid TV is and anyone that
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:04:02.620]  could sit through an hour a jersey sure should win a medal because it's it's
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:08.980]  pure torture and when you see how ignorant it has become and how elevated
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:16.780]  it has hit the society the people that are the smart money are going to say
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:24.020]  contrary to what the media says contrary to what Madison Avenue in Hollywood
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:32.620]  say contrary to what the president may say and the politicians this is not what
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:38.860]  the people want it's only the stupidest of people that want that and what's
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:45.420]  happened is Paul they look to that lowest common denominator and make that the
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:50.820]  standard the smart money says no no no I'm not going that way I'm going for the
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:55.980]  people that don't want that okay stay there Gerald we'll be back to explore
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:05:01.700]  this further after the break this is the Alex juncture you've heard Alex
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:05.380]  explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:09.260]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:12.420]  entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:17.140]  deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:21.780]  Sephalde and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:25.900]  silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:29.740]  also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:34.620]  deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this includes the
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:41.220]  eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system

[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:02.980]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:07.340]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:11.500]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.540]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.420]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:23.700]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:27.860]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:32.180]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:35.860]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:40.060]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:43.020]  mind folks I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:46.460]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:23.420]  Alex Jones
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:28.960]  the Alex Jones show on Wednesday September 8th now he's had to switch to the
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:34.860]  phone line because of a guy's issue but we're continuing with Gerald Valente of
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:41.740]  the Trends Research Institute at TrendsResearch.com now Gerald picking up on
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:45.740]  that issue of how we're being manipulated and more specifically in the
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:51.460]  context of the immigration debate I know that in the in the past the Trends
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:55.940]  Journal has made forecasts about how immigration is going to become this
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:09:01.860]  increasingly devices and politically polarizing force as we move forward and
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:06.820]  obviously this is in the public mind at the moment with the debate about the
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:11.340]  situation in Arizona and then you look at other things in the news that the
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:17.420]  around zero mosque issue which has got people blood boiling on both sides you've
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:23.020]  got the Quran burning story was now even general portray it stepping in a
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:28.100]  morning that this could cause violence so you have white sincerely with
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:32.700]  muslims you have muslims in Indonesia another place is burning American
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:39.060]  flags in protest of this Quran story and then you have films like machete being
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:44.900]  released which are their attention between white and Hispanic so Gerald is
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:49.900]  this a kind of physical phenomenon or you know does it represent something new
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:54.820]  while we've been manipulated into some kind of confrontation or even rape
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:59.860]  force scenario who were distracted from the crumbling economy and the coming
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:05.460]  wars well you well yes in a lot of ways by the way we have a bad connection I
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:11.460]  don't know how I sound on on your end but you're coming in all fuzzy on mine and
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:16.060]  if you find it just on the phone okay before I jump into that I'd like to
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:21.420]  finish what I was talking about how to make money on the elegance trend it goes
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:29.140]  back to the 20% solution there are 20% of the population with money and with
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:34.860]  brains that want to keep stepping up so it means if you're going to open up a
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:41.020]  little restaurant open up a cool little bistro that's really done nicely but with
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:46.740]  good price points you're seeing more and more Paul the people that are making it
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:53.220]  in this economy opening up new venues doing it with putting elegance and grace
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:59.380]  back into it people dressing up a lot of people really want to do it but they
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:07.100]  don't have anywhere to do it in music in entertainment you name it food
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:13.940]  fashion at every level people are looking for a higher level is everybody
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:20.180]  no there's going to be the 80% of the over you know the people that are
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:26.740]  stuffing themselves with junk food that are sedentary that are strapped in front
[01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:32.860]  of the TV or computer and not moving lose them you're not going to get them so
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:38.620]  we're in a marketing sense go toward the elegance now to answer your question
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:49.500]  about this whole anti-muslim rage if you go back to our trends journal 1993 and
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:58.900]  then my book trends 2000 that came out in December of tooth of 1996 we wrote
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:08.620]  about crusades 2000 it was in the making and it's continuing what they're
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:15.580]  doing is their peep it's it's distinct that every Muslim is a lunatic is like
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:21.180]  saying that every Christian wants an inquisition you know it's it's it's
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:26.660]  ridiculous at this point but they keep driving it further and further but then
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:32.700]  you hear somebody like of general Petraeus saying that burning the
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:39.220]  Koran could be dangerous to American troops hey general Petraeus how about
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:45.820]  invading Arab countries and and occupying them and killing innocent
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:52.140]  people you think that could be dangerous to American troops oh no no our
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:57.900]  foreign policy has nothing to do with this they don't like us because they
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:04.060]  don't like Americans because we go to Disneyland and shop at Walmart so you
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:10.420]  know let's look at the reality here the reality is that these wars that America's
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:15.460]  fighting around the world along with their British cousins you know those
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:22.380]  lovely people whose flag never set on the English Empire and have conquered so
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:28.180]  many countries could that be any of the reason for the anti-Americanism now you
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:33.340]  throw on top of it let's go back to what happened after World War two
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:38.420]  they're rebuilding Europe and they want cheap labor where they're gonna get it
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:44.180]  from I got an idea let's get some Turks in there so the Germans bring in a lot
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:49.700]  of cheap labor of all the countries the United States they all bring in cheap
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:55.380]  labor and now when times turn tough they want them out of there so it really
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:59.940]  goes back to the labor issue when you look at this and when you look at the
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:05.340]  anti-immigration trends in the U.S. for example who are the people that promoted
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:10.660]  this letting everybody in their uncle and sister and brother fly into this
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:18.900]  nation you know unimpeded try the National Association of manufacturers try
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:25.740]  Microsoft bringing in all these people on H1B visas you know cheap labor at any
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:31.100]  level so that's what's really going on here you have a population boom you had
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:35.220]  from go back a hundred thousand years ago it took them from a hundred thousand
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:41.500]  years ago to 1900 to put 1.5 billion people on the planet two World Wars
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:47.580]  later the Vietnam War the Korean War the Afghan War and on and on the wars now
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:54.700]  we have what six point five billion six point seven billion too many people not
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:15:00.260]  enough jobs immigration is going to be a major issue and along with it becomes
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:06.700]  the religious and the racial right so you're basically saying that we are
[01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:12.220]  being manipulated to kind of get at each other's throats is that just to
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:17.300]  distract us there's no questioning do to get at each other's throats and I mean
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:21.500]  this this whole thing here's my deal by the way people ask me I'm a New Yorker
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:25.620]  you know about this mosque well first of all you understand it's not a mosque
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:31.980]  it's more like a community center but here's my take on it everybody all the
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:40.220]  churches all the synagogues all the mosques all the religions as Jesus Christ
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:46.580]  said render unto Caesar what ceases let them all pay taxes and then we're going
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:51.620]  to see a different story here and you're also by the way it'll help balance the
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:57.460]  budget let all these religions all these charitable organizations all these
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:03.020]  nonprofit organizations that are hiding on the whatever banner they're using let
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:07.580]  them pay taxes and then I'll tell you what Paul I bet this issue wouldn't be
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:15.780]  such a big issue amazing shifting gears you mentioned that the unemployment rate
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:20.140]  in regard to immigration I had Bob Chapman on the show the other day who
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:25.260]  publishes the International Forecaster and he was saying basically you know we
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:30.660]  know the US Labor Department's cut books say 9.6 unemployment figure is
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:36.220]  completely inaccurate but Bob was in fact saying that if you take the U6
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:43.180]  unemployment figure of 16.7% and then add in even the statistics that they
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:47.260]  don't include we're talking about an unemployment rate in the United States
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:56.540]  which is already over 21% now I mean even at the 1933 level we were at 25% so
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:01.300]  I mean do you have a figure in mind for what the real unemployment rate isn't in
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:05.820]  America at the moment not the one that the CNBC talking heads are telling us
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:12.980]  and you know how far are we are we gonna go in terms of unemployment until we can
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:18.500]  actually acknowledge that we're in another great depression well I think
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:23.020]  Bob Chapman does excellent work and I go by what he says on that number you know
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:28.340]  he really has it down well and and I agree with him wholeheartedly we're
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:32.860]  going to continue to decline let's look at what happened last week when the
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:39.660]  stock market you know ran rampant for for one day on the good news that we
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:44.900]  didn't lose as many jobs as we thought we did I mean how could this happen you
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:48.700]  know that a market would respond like that and then you look at where the
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:55.580]  jobs were created hey how about home health aides or or ambulance workers
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:00.620]  you know medical workers and and bartenders and waitresses wonderful
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:06.700]  jobs they created so even as they're creating jobs and remember we have to
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:12.060]  create anywhere between a hundred and fifty thousand to a hundred and twenty
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:18.860]  five thousand a month just to keep up with population growth of new people
[01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:23.860]  moving into the system we have an unemployment rate that we're going to
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:30.620]  see as we move deeper into this greatest depression over 25 percent it's gonna
[01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:40.460]  look like sunny Spain in good old USA it's amazing I mean we had the 54,000
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:46.260]  job loss figure was reported at the end of last week I read that and I thought
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:50.660]  well that's bad news and then I went and visited Bloomberg news and they were
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:56.020]  celebrating it as if it is this great achievement that we don't have lost 54,000
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:19:00.340]  jobs I mean as you say with the population growing as a result of
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:04.020]  immigration I mean that's that's even more you know even less jobs for
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:10.180]  everybody else but staying on the economy the dollar 15 year low against
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:16.900]  the yen you've been warning of a dollar crisis in 2010 how is that going to be
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:21.580]  sparked off you mentioned some kind of bank holiday related to a terror attack
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:25.140]  is do you see the dollar collapsing suddenly or is it just going to be this
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:31.140]  gradual decline no we think it's going to be a sudden it's going to be a real
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:38.700]  hit and and it's being set up already for it in so many different ways in a
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:44.580]  little while we're going to hear President Obama do another Dorgan
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:50.580]  Pony show in Ohio about job this the economy is going to collapse there's
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:55.180]  going to be something that's gonna knock it off its pins all right stay there

[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:35.340]  trendsresearch.com now I remember writing an article about a prediction
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:41.380]  that Gerald made I believe was back in 2008 when he talks about these tax
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:47.140]  rebellions and this was before the emergence of the Tea Party which of
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:53.460]  course in its embryonic form was this anti-tax movement is since been largely
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:58.300]  infiltrated by the Republican Party but just another example of even just in
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:03.700]  the last couple of years one of Gerald's predictions in his Trends Research
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:11.100]  Journal has come to fruition now Gerald I want to talk about neo-survivalism this
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:15.900]  is something that's mentioned in your most recent issue how is this going to
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:20.300]  manifest itself are we talking food gardens people buying more land you
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:25.540]  know people going back to the simple life to farming or are we talking about a
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:30.220]  more interconnected model of survivalism with a return to things like the old
[01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:35.460]  fashioned cooperatives how are we going to see this unfold well it is just about
[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:40.660]  how you you summed it up it's a combination of the two it's rugged
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:48.700]  individualism and working together as a community be dealing with people that
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:55.140]  you could trust like-minded people and buying local it's another big one you
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:26:02.220]  know Paul this is a perfect grasshopper and ant winter that we're going into the
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:08.380]  summer was one remember they told us of a summer of recovery to quote the great
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:16.260]  Joe Biden the vice president of the United States and literary genius and
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:22.020]  here we are there is no recovery even the cover-up didn't work the stimulus is
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:27.980]  running out but how many people like the grasshopper were dancing and believing
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:33.900]  in the tune being spun out of the White House and they're not preparing for what
[01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:41.220]  we see as one of the harshest economic winters in living memory and I use that
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:46.340]  word winter you know not to be taken literally as it's only going to be this
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:54.020]  winter but for a long time to come so in neo survivalism it's also important to
[01:26:54.020 --> 01:27:02.180]  understand that that ant lives in a colony it can't do it by itself
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:07.820]  regardless of how hard it works in trying to prepare for the future the
[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:12.700]  colony is going to be the strongest when they all work together and that's
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:18.460]  something by the way that's been pulled out of society by the very people that
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:24.340]  are selling it to us the Madison Avenue Hollywood Washington Wall Street
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:30.540]  fraternity they keep telling us about rugged individualism you can do it on
[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:36.420]  yourself super mom the independent single person you don't need anybody make
[01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:42.220]  it on your own in the meanwhile they're doing all the deals try getting into
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:46.460]  their club and pulling off one you'll never get in there unless you're a
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:52.460]  member of the Harvard Princeton Yale Bullets bombs and banks fraternity so
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:58.340]  what's going on is that in neo survivalism people really have to understand
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:03.940]  and think truly like the ant because we're only hearing part of the parable
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:09.820]  and not looking at the other end of it it's going to be very difficult times
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:16.580]  join up with as many people as you can and not only to join up for survival but
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:23.580]  to also help move us in to a more prolific future what do I do personally I
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:29.060]  don't buy corporate food none of it I won't eat it I'm Italian I know what
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:34.060]  good food is and I won't and I won't eat this stuff so support your local I
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:39.740]  just went to a to a restaurant the other day and I ordered a Stolly on the
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:47.440]  rocks and the woman said to me we only have American brand vodka and they
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:53.100]  had a whole list of them I said all right that's terrific and they only have
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:29:00.300]  local eggs not eggs from these so-called factory farms these chicken coop
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:08.580]  concentration camps how about a nice sunny side up egg from Auschwitz farm I
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:14.700]  mean how could people eat that stuff 30 half a billion of them being recalled
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:22.580]  and the FDA hadn't been there in a year so the neo survivalism yes it starts with
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:29.460]  the individual but spreads to the community okay that sounds like a plan
[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:34.140]  to me and we're gonna go to your calls for Gerald Solenti in the next segment

[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:22.020]  thank you
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:27.780]  escape from the prison planet that's right ladies and gentlemen you have took
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:32.300]  the red pill and we're talking with Gerald Salente of the Trends Research
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:38.060]  Institute and I mean this information is basically like gold dust I mean the
[01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:42.860]  Trends Research Institute has got a record second to none I was looking at
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:47.980]  the predictions made on the website trendsresearch.com and you can go down
[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:52.260]  the list and see the the source of when that prediction was made and the fact
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:57.020]  that it actually came true two or three years later and I mean the accuracy is
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:34:02.020]  just stunning it's out of this world which is why many people are turning to
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:06.860]  Gerald Salente for clues about how this greatest depression as he calls it is
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:13.580]  going to unfold over the next couple years. Gerald looking forward to 2012
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:18.220]  you stay in the most recent issue of the Trends Journal that we're going to see
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:23.500]  this third party rise to prominence and lead a kind of backlash against this
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:28.900]  collapse you say it's going to be helped by online bloggers and also the
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:34.500]  independent internet-based media who will wield as much influence as the
[01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:40.140]  corporate press but what I want to know is this new political party that you say
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:44.340]  is going to emerge is this going to be at the Tea Party is it going to be the
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:49.060]  Libertarians or is it going to be something new that we see emerge as
[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:53.620]  this meltdown gets worse over the next couple of years. We think it's not going
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:57.460]  definitely not going to be the Tea Party the Tea Party has been co-opted by the
[01:34:57.460 --> 01:35:03.340]  Republican Party as we all know and and special investment interests so it's not
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:08.260]  going to be that at all but it's very significant to understand that as you
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:15.540]  mentioned in actuals in 2007 our top trends we we we came up with tax
[01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:20.540]  revolts and we called it the coalition of the cash strapped and when you would
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:24.780]  go back then and think that there would have been another party people thought
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:29.980]  we were crazy that Americans would never get off their lazy boys and out on to
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:35.780]  the streets so it's significant with the Tea Party to show how viable the
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:42.980]  movement is and how deep the anger is here's what I see as a new third party
[01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:49.260]  I was talking about the poison food that they're feeding the people if you want
[01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:55.780]  to talk about you know one of my lines is mass produced mass consumed mass
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:36:03.540]  murder so to me food is a very important issue water as I listen to your
[01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:10.420]  advertisements a very important issue the air we breathe the environmental issues
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:16.020]  let's not be children about this we'll get caught up as these crazies talk
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:21.020]  about tree huggers we're talking about living you know essentially in an
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:25.460]  environment that's healthy for us you're not a tree hugger you're just
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:31.940]  intelligent so on that aspect we look at a party that's those things are
[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:37.860]  important without taking you know an extreme view on on some of those issues
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:43.900]  on the other aspect libertarian in terms of government staying out of our
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:50.360]  bedrooms and staying out of other countries try that one on facades so
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:58.300]  libertarian in the sense of also a Ron Paul in terms of the federal reserve
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:03.100]  owning our country and the set along with the central bankers who they
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:10.120]  represent so I would call it and I know this word sounds dirty to some
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:15.140]  conservatives because they're misconstruing the meaning of the word we
[01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:21.500]  call it progressive libertarian a Ralph nader on one end when it comes to
[01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:27.100]  environmental and food issues and a Ron Paul on the other end when it comes to
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:34.540]  libertarian issues a blending of those two that's what we see as a major party
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:42.300]  forming by 2012 that's very interesting because even now we have major
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:48.940]  candidates for example Sharon angle who builds herself as a tea party candidate
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:53.260]  she's taking on Harry Reid who of course is you know one of the most powerful
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:58.580]  Democrats out there and one of her main issues is getting fluoride out of the
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:04.780]  water supply so now several of these tea party candidates not to dismiss the fact
[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:08.700]  as you said that the leadership of the tea party has been infiltrated by the
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:13.660]  Republicans but a lot of the tea party candidates are embracing this healthy
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:18.180]  food and water angle as part of their platform for the upcoming midterm
[01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:22.740]  elections we're going to go to call us now for Gerald Salente and the first one
[01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:28.420]  is Joe in Pennsylvania Joe what's your question for Gerald today hi I just want
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:32.620]  to say what you were just talking about I do agree with that a hundred percent
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:37.140]  about the food in the water and how you know we definitely need to get smarter
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:42.940]  about how we go about producing our food but my question is a two-fold
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:48.420]  question and it is regarding the music industry back to your discussion about
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:56.220]  culture I am a musician myself and over the years what I've learned is that
[01:38:56.220 --> 01:39:03.460]  obviously you know the global elite run the entertainment industry as well and
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:09.340]  basically what I've learned is if you aren't willing to play their game you
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:12.900]  know you're not going to have any success with it and I have a specific
[01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:18.140]  question about one particular thing and this is a trend that I guess has
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:23.980]  increased over the last few years in particular the music industry there's a
[01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:31.420]  lot of rumors of you know people selling their souls people actually
[01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:35.860]  committing blood sacrifices for success in the music industry and the reason I
[01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:41.540]  say this is because my mother Irene Janowski is a satanic witch she's tried
[01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:47.180]  to poison me to get access to my music and I'm wondering like if you're a
[01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:52.020]  person who you know as a straight shooter thinks straight is not willing to play
[01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:57.700]  this game and dumb down your music just to make money how do you overcome that
[01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:04.820]  and get beyond that control that they have and I mean if people are willing
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:10.380]  to do that how do you actually go about overcoming that because well I've been
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:15.300]  trying to for years and I really have well it's hard it's a struggle and all
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:20.140]  of us that are independent you know have a very difficult time and we have to
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:24.860]  keep staying at it until success comes so for example you call it the music
[01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:30.340]  industry it's an oxymoron music can't be an industry but that's what it's become
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:35.460]  just like food can't be an industry but that's what it's become so if you take
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:40.420]  the eggs from the Auschwitz farms that that just returned 300 every
[01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:46.540]  call a half a billion and compare it you know to Mary's happy egg farm over here
[01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:51.940]  you know you could see the difference in the quality so the quality is not going
[01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:58.540]  to happen through the industry and now with the internet the reality is that
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:04.580]  yes you can break through on your own and it also comes back to going back to
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:10.020]  the old way remember when the big bands used to be on the road 300 days
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:14.300]  that of the year so you're going to start seeing more and more of those
[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:19.620]  little venues open up and it's going to be difficult it's never easy it's only
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:23.460]  easy when you're a member of the white shoe boy club
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:29.740]  Harvard Princeton Yale the rest of us we have to work to get there thanks for
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:35.740]  the call yeah I mean I call the music industry the Babylon system I mean talk
[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:40.260]  about thrill of the thuggish some of this trash that's being fed to our young
[01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:45.340]  people via this industry as you rightly called it is you know Lady Gargar and so
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:50.460]  forth is just shocking to behold we're going to go to Steve in Florida Steve
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:55.820]  you're talking to Gerald Salente go ahead I was wondering how you see silver
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:42:01.340]  and if in the next two years you keep going up well you know I'm not I'm not
[01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:07.540]  I'm not a that's not silver's not one of my strong points I'm more solid into
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:13.580]  gold and have been since the late 70s however from everything we see a
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:18.900]  silver looks really solid as well and again I'm not giving financial advice
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:24.180]  but as a forecaster it looks like a real good play because anything other than
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:30.860]  paper currency that has a intrinsic value that you could exchange on like
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:37.940]  silver and gold we believe is going to to continue to grow and that's exactly
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:41.700]  what Bob Chapman was saying yesterday we're going to move on because we've got
[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:47.620]  lots of callers for Gerald Salente Joe in Texas you're on the air go ahead hi I
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:43:00.140]  have a question about gold actually I have been buying gold since 99 so it's
[01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:09.980]  eventually going to be time to sell some of it and what I'm reading is that the
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:17.660]  government could do something ridiculous with taxes on gold when you sell it and
[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:24.620]  also the discount when you try to sell it you won't be able to sell it at the
[01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:30.940]  spot price there's a discount that you'll have to take into consideration so those
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:37.340]  questions and also just to give people who may be thinking about gold now a
[01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:47.420]  warning do not buy any numismatic coins it's a rip off okay could the the
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:51.180]  government's capable of doing anything there's no question about it that's why
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:55.060]  a lot of people that I know have moved their gold offshore or out of the
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:44:01.020]  country so anything can happen having said that however I think it's going to
[01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:07.300]  be very difficult for them to do so the taxes the the new 1099 forms that they
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:11.660]  put they they squeezed in with the health care reform bill that are now
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:19.500]  requiring anyone with a purchase of over $600 they have to fill out a 1099 and
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:25.340]  that's done primarily for the to stop the to attract the gold dealers so yeah
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:32.780]  these are all realities that may happen and as you say a time to sell out for me
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:39.940]  just I'm speaking only for myself gold is my old age you know when I'm in my
[01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:44.500]  80s God willing and you know I'm not working anymore for whatever reason I
[01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:49.980]  want to have that there for my old age if you have to sell it I believe there's
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:53.780]  always going to be a buyer and I always believe there'll be somebody's going to
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:58.060]  be out there that doesn't want to make a big deal about it that will buy it will
[01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:02.820]  you get it at the spot value no when you buy coins you buy them high and when
[01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:06.940]  you when you when you sell them you buy them you you sell them for less that's
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:14.220]  just the way it works in that system however look at where gold is gone from
[01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:20.820]  for example when we call the gold bull run in 2001 when it was selling at two
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:25.060]  hundred and seventy five dollars an ounce and now it's trading for roughly
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:30.300]  what one thousand two hundred and sixty so even with that little fluctuation of
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:35.140]  selling less than when you boarded at the spot at that time and it's not going
[01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:40.100]  to make a big deal and by the way we were just heard from norio rabbini who
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:45.060]  they call dr. doom well you know I don't know if it's dr. doom or dr. dumb
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:52.260]  because in 2009 he said the quote gold has no intrinsic value and that
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:58.220]  possibly it could go to over eleven hundred dollars an ounce and as I
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:02.260]  mentioned now we're at two you know one thousand two hundred and sixty and he's
[01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:07.580]  saying that people it's nonsense and people are crazy if they think it's
[01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:11.780]  going to go to two thousand an ounce so I guess you could say I'm talking
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:16.900]  nonsense and then I'm crazy because we believe gold is going to go to two
[01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:24.500]  thousand and possibly beyond okay thanks for the call yeah I mean as you were
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:28.620]  saying Gerald we saw the protests in France yesterday they're just going to
[01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:33.380]  keep raising the age of retirement through these austerity measures so using
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:39.620]  gold as a kind of pension is a really good idea for people with regard to tax
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:44.020]  they already tax the sale of silver in the United Kingdom so you know
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:50.340]  governments have that option always open to them you mentioned norio rabbini I
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:54.900]  mean isn't the case that you know ruby and Krugman and all those all these
[01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:59.700]  people the happy clappers have suddenly now changed their tune and they're the
[01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:03.980]  doomsayers when people like yourself Gerald and Bob Chapman and others have
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:08.660]  been communicating the same message for years whereas these more mainstream
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:12.500]  talking heads have suddenly just changed their tune to jump on the bandwagon
[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:18.860]  well it's very clear Paul again it's Harvard Princeton Yale you look at their
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:26.500]  credentials in their pedigree it's one big circle jerk it's always them listen
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:33.900]  how blind or stupid can people be if they can't see in front of their eye look
[01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:38.980]  where they're all from whether it's the president of the United States the
[01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:46.580]  president of of the Federal Reserve or a stacked Supreme Court what kind of
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:54.620]  imbecile could actually buy into the line that we have a Supreme Court of real
[01:47:54.620 --> 01:48:01.340]  justices when it's stacked with Harvard and Yale and you know why it's stacked
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:06.980]  like that I'll make it really clear because they're better than we are they
[01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:12.980]  live better than we are they take more than we have and they live higher than
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:18.260]  we do look at Hillary Clinton look at the rest of them every time they go to a
[01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:25.100]  foreign country they arrive in a jumbo jet they wave from the door and by the
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:31.340]  time they get down to the bottom they roll out a red carpet and strike up a
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:38.900]  band you think they have an attitude Brian in South Carolina you're talking to
[01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:42.020]  Gerald Salente trendsresearch.com go ahead
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:46.860]  hello Gerald how are you doing um boy I've covered so much I don't know where
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:50.740]  to start I was trying to think of a good question and a good topic but I know
[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:55.740]  you're a trends guy so I'll stick with that um one of the trends that I'm
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:49:02.300]  concerned about as a Christian as a biblical Christian the situation down
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:07.780]  in in Florida with the guy burning the Koran's the basic institution of
[01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:14.420]  Christianity from a biblical perspective is to share your faith of others and no
[01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:18.220]  man shall come to the Father except by me that's that's Jesus saying he knows
[01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:23.860]  only one path to heaven and that is me talking about himself of course I know
[01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:30.180]  um if you were to go to Israel right now and you shared your faith with the
[01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:35.180]  Jews they put you in jail it's not allowed it's illegal you go to Saudi
[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:40.420]  Arabia you'd be lucky to get out of there with your head in the United States I
[01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:45.100]  think what the guy's doing down there is bad because I don't know where he's
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:50.500]  going to go now to try to share his faith with these people he says that the
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:56.220]  Koran's junk you know I don't read it so that'll pay something but I think you
[01:49:56.220 --> 01:50:02.660]  may have messed his witness up um I know as a southern Baptist a couple years
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:09.540]  ago a contract was signed with Rome it is actually illegal or against the
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:15.180]  agreement was that Southern Baptist would not proselytize Roman Catholics and
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:22.540]  as a trend how long do you think Christianity has left to be biblically
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:27.260]  what it is and to share his faith before they start enforcing these laws
[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:32.460]  this United Nations have on the books to make it illegal to share your faith in
[01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:38.300]  a way that's not politically correct we'll get Gerald Zansrafter the break

[01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:23.620]  let's talk into Gerald Salente of the Trens Research Institute Gerald I think
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:27.620]  we covered the Karanis you earlier but you have any brief comments for the
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:32.420]  previous caller well you know I do in a sense that I want to read this from the
[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:39.340]  this is from my book trends 2000 this was written actually in 1995 we talked
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:47.140]  about I mentioned Crusades 2000 this is what we wrote back 15 years ago the
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:52.540]  seeds of the new Crusades was sown in areas of Africa the Middle East Eastern
[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:57.700]  Europe and Asia throughout the Muslim world devout masses politically
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:55:03.820]  repressed and impoverished were rising up against their endemically corrupt and
[01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:11.780]  inefficient secular governments with their pro-western alliances imperialism
[01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:17.860]  directly or indirectly took the blame for the poverty the lack of opportunity
[01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:23.820]  and the social and moral decay disenfranchised desperate politically
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:31.180]  powerless Muslims in many countries look to charismatic clerics to change their
[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:36.580]  destiny and that's what you have and we said this time we talk about the last
[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:41.220]  crusades fought by the Christians but this time the God of record will be
[01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:47.260]  called Allah and the sanction will come from Islamic clerics it's called foreign
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:54.940]  policy amazing that's sure to get more people calling in unfortunately we're
[01:55:54.940 --> 01:55:59.620]  running out of time I'm going to be selfish and jump in with a probably a
[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:04.940]  final question here Gerald you mentioned earlier about the all transactions over
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:10.900]  $10,000 having to be reported to the IRS we've got Greece yeah yeah we got
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:17.220]  Greece from 2011 banning all cash transactions over 1500 euros we've
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:23.140]  got Mexico and Italy doing the same banning large cash transactions why are
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:27.900]  governments around the world cracking down on cash because they're trying to
[01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:32.700]  get as many as much money as they can from us for taxes and they don't want
[01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:37.700]  cash transactions going on at all because they won't be able to steal more
[01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:44.260]  from us and it's also a move toward trying to keep things under control when
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:51.620]  the great crash of 2010 happens and the dollar won't be worth a dime nor many of
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:57.260]  the other currencies and that's why I'm eighty percent invested in gold and the
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:57:03.580]  rest of my cash is spread between Canadian dollars US dollars and Swiss
[01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:08.540]  francs because to me the Swiss are the money cockroaches of the world they're
[01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:14.460]  not going anywhere and for my cash all I want to do is break even and on my goal
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:19.980]  that's my wild card so the governments are going to be looking to squeeze every
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:23.980]  penny they can as you mentioned about what would happen with the with the
[01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:29.540]  strikes and yesterday in the UK and France against austerity measures these
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:35.020]  aren't austerity measures it's called robbing the people to take all their
[01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:40.620]  money and to give it to the bankers that's what an austerity measure is
[01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:46.900]  exactly Frank in New York probably final caller quick question for Gerald
[01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:51.620]  Salante please go ahead Frank in New York hey warrior yeah I was just wondering
[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:56.100]  if Gerald believes that instead of you know like you know we always have to
[01:57:56.100 --> 01:58:02.140]  save for the future put into individual retirement accounts invest in gold the
[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:08.780]  whole works but the social security and the old and social programs I mean you
[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:13.220]  said that you know we should become 30 seconds what's your question go ahead
[01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:17.100]  quickly please okay yeah what do you think of the social safety net don't
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:20.060]  you think we should expand them don't you think we should give more money back
[01:58:20.060 --> 01:58:23.540]  okay we're gonna get the money of course you'd be wonderful we don't have the
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:27.300]  money and you don't have enough people working into it and where you're still

[01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:58.780]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:03.100]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:07.060]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:11.380]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:15.740]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:19.500]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:23.580]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:27.540]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:31.380]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:59:31.380 --> 01:59:34.100]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:12.380]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does

[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:42.860]  activities which might lead to an attempt to set up a fascist dictatorship
[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:49.060]  the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
[02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:55.660]  the very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:01:02.060]  people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies the secret
[02:01:02.060 --> 02:01:07.340]  oaths and the secret proceedings president Bush signed a formal agreement
[02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:11.180]  that will end the United States as we know it and he took the step without
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:16.700]  approval from either the US Congress or the people of the United States the
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:21.380]  secret organizations of the world power elite are no longer secret

[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:57.140]  feel they should run the world for their own selfish interest now we can see a
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:02:03.180]  new world coming into view a world in which there is the very real prospect
[02:02:03.180 --> 02:02:07.340]  of a new world order bill the burgers making great progress toward a world
[02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:12.420]  government and only an educated informed public can stop them in their tracks
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:21.460]  and he wants to destroy the United States he's a traitor it's good to be
[02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:26.060]  back at the council on foreign relations as Pete mentioned I've been a member for

[02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:35.220]  that when I was campaigning for reelection back home in Wyoming let us
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:39.700]  never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories

[02:02:50.180 --> 02:03:00.380]  it's bill the burgers right there the trans-Texas corridor is a vital part
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:05.500]  because we stopped here in Texas we stopped the new world order ride here
[02:03:05.500 --> 02:03:13.100]  in Texas this thing started here and to save this country we kill this damn
[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:23.180]  thing here
[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:36.420]  there is a chance for the president of the United States to carry out a phrase

[02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:37.340]  of tyranny is law a worldwide control grid designed to ensure the overlords
[02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:42.140]  monopoly of power forever our species will be condemned to this nightmare
[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:46.580]  future unless the masses are awakened to the New World Order master plan and
[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:54.540]  mobilized to defeat it erected by a secretive group the Georgia guide stones
[02:09:54.540 --> 02:10:00.580]  are a testament to the elites plan for a world religion global laws with a
[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:07.540]  global court and army to enforce it and set in stone it is written that the
[02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:12.300]  population never rise above 500 million
[02:10:16.260 --> 02:10:22.140]  in this film you will learn how our world is truly governed you will see how
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:26.420]  highly secretive roundtable groups interlock to form a global intelligence
[02:10:26.420 --> 02:10:31.260]  network this group has been steering planetary affairs for hundreds of years
[02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:38.540]  now in the final stage they prepare for open world government a goal tyrants
[02:10:38.540 --> 02:10:44.220]  throughout history have lusted after Dr. Michael Kaufman is a published
[02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:50.460]  ecologist specializing in ecosystem research forest ecology and ecosystem
[02:10:50.460 --> 02:10:55.620]  classification Dr. Kaufman played a key role in blocking the
[02:10:55.620 --> 02:10:59.940]  ratification of the convention on biological diversity in the u.s. Senate
[02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:04.060]  the concept of a new world order has been around for centuries it's been
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:09.940]  receiving tremendous play over the last half the 20th century George Bush the
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:13.980]  first senior president George Bush used it a lot in his speeches and really
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:20.420]  implies that he really wants to see a order in which we have a universal or a
[02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:25.260]  global type of governance in which every human being on planet earth is
[02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:28.340]  ultimately responsible to policies that are being formulated at the
[02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:35.460]  international level it is a big idea a new world order
[02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:44.180]  president Bush said that the new world order was in town in in tune and that's
[02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:47.700]  what they were working for the UN is part of that government they're working
[02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:51.420]  right now very significantly for a North American Union that's why there's a lot
[02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:54.220]  of people in Washington don't care too much about our borders they have a
[02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:58.060]  philosophic belief that national sovereignty is not important it's also
[02:11:58.060 --> 02:12:02.340]  the reason I have made very strong suggestion that we need not be in the
[02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:05.980]  united nation for our national security it's really always the same you go back
[02:12:05.980 --> 02:12:10.660]  throughout all of history the Roman Empire the Soviet Union Hitler during
[02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:14.580]  the Nazism was always saying that it's going to create the utopia for the
[02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:19.580]  average person when in fact history always shows that it does exactly the
[02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:30.820]  opposite conquest an empire is as old as civilization Babylon Egypt and Greece
[02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:37.620]  they all built empires in an attempt to rule the world the Roman system at its
[02:12:37.620 --> 02:12:43.180]  peak dominated the known world complex governmental systems were developed to
[02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:49.260]  control diverse populations daring the period between the 15th and 19th century
[02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:59.260]  new empires emerged and again waged war for supremacy the nobility as well as
[02:12:59.260 --> 02:13:04.420]  the thriving merchant class were financed by a handful of private banks
[02:13:04.420 --> 02:13:09.140]  many of the great money houses would hedge their bets and finance both sides
[02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:15.340]  of a war sophisticated intelligence gathering networks gave the financiers
[02:13:15.340 --> 02:13:22.060]  a clear edge over the government's they were slowly gaining control of on the
[02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:28.020]  18th of June 1815 agents of the British arm of the Rothschild family looked on
[02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:32.980]  as Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte fought desperately to save his army from the
[02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:39.380]  jaws of a British Prussian Penser attack a Rothschild agent was able to get the
[02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:45.020]  news Napoleon's defeat at the hands of Lord Wellington to Nathan Rothschild
[02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:52.300]  a full 20 hours before the news reached London Nathan the head of the British
[02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:56.580]  arm of the Rothschild family put out the rumor to the London stock exchange
[02:13:56.580 --> 02:14:05.220]  that Napoleon had won the war stocks plunged by 98% and Rothschild was then
[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:14.260]  able to buy up the entire British economy for pennies on the pound when
[02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:21.780]  the news of Napoleon's defeat finally arrived stock soared Britain was now the
[02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:29.260]  undisputed ruler of Europe and Rothschild ruled England the already
[02:14:29.260 --> 02:14:36.420]  dominant British Empire grew even more aggressive her troops and bureaucracy
[02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:43.780]  spread across the globe the Sun never set on Britannia's holdings the
[02:14:43.780 --> 02:14:49.420]  banking cartel funded in fact since about 1800 they have funded both sides of
[02:14:49.420 --> 02:14:53.900]  almost every war and of course they're getting the interest off of the loans
[02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:56.460]  that they've given the various governments and the wars that they have
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:15:04.220]  actually helped stimulate and create by 1900 Germany was a rising force and a
[02:15:04.220 --> 02:15:09.100]  leader of the industrial revolution World War one for instance there was
[02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:12.980]  absolutely no reason to have World War one except that it was an ideal
[02:15:12.980 --> 02:15:18.020]  opportunity for the banking cartel to make a pile of money by funding both
[02:15:18.020 --> 02:15:24.220]  sides of that particular war on June 28th 1914 the heir to the Austrian
[02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:29.540]  Hungarian throne Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated while traveling in a
[02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:43.140]  motorcade the black hand a serving in secret society with connections to
[02:15:43.140 --> 02:16:07.060]  French and British intelligence took credit World War one had begun
[02:16:07.060 --> 02:16:12.020]  armaments companies financed by Rothschild controlled banks in Germany
[02:16:12.020 --> 02:16:28.580]  France England and Austria at least 20 million were killed in the war it was
[02:16:28.580 --> 02:16:35.060]  a conflict so terrible the people vowed to never fight again they dubbed it the
[02:16:35.060 --> 02:16:42.820]  war to end all wars question is why did they want war well first of all is
[02:16:42.820 --> 02:16:47.540]  money and power but secondly they wanted to create the League of Nations they had
[02:16:47.540 --> 02:16:52.220]  this in their plans all along and as a consequence once the war was over or
[02:16:52.220 --> 02:16:55.740]  about to be over they begin to formulate this idea of a League of Nations so
[02:16:55.740 --> 02:17:00.340]  this would never ever happen again hundreds of years of practice made the
[02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:06.060]  British experts at hiding their empire behind puppet governments and councils
[02:17:06.060 --> 02:17:11.300]  in the name of stopping all future conflicts they proposed that countries
[02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:17.060]  would join a League of Nations their true intention was for the League to
[02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:21.180]  serve as a framework for world government
[02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:26.540]  President Woodrow Wilson who had spearheaded the establishment of the
[02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:31.380]  private Federal Reserve system in the United States in 1913 strongly supported
[02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:36.260]  the establishment of the League of Nations Woodrow Wilson was a very naive
[02:17:36.260 --> 02:17:40.340]  president he was basically a college professor that was grafted into this
[02:17:40.340 --> 02:17:46.780]  whole system the League convened in Paris in 1919 but many nations recognized
[02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:52.340]  it as a threat to their sovereignty and refused to join frustrated by the US
[02:17:52.340 --> 02:17:56.380]  Congress blocking the League of Nations British intelligence with the help
[02:17:56.380 --> 02:18:00.420]  of the Rockefeller family set up the Council on Foreign Relations in New
[02:18:00.420 --> 02:18:06.220]  York City in 1921 the Council recruited the best and brightest of American life
[02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:12.620]  to support the growth of the Anglo-American Empire the CFR stated
[02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:17.140]  mission is to abolish all nation states in favor of an old powerful world

[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:40.500]  National socialism will use its own revolution for establishing a new
[02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:44.300]  world order Adolf Hitler
[02:18:46.180 --> 02:18:50.380]  supporters of the Fascists in the United States in England believed that the
[02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:54.060]  military should be used to quickly transform the world into a new world

[02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:43.900]  trilateral plan was the creation of the European Union unifying Europe had been
[02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:48.940]  tried many times and was extremely unpopular where Napoleon and Hitler
[02:26:48.940 --> 02:26:53.540]  had failed to accomplish their goals using force the globalists would succeed
[02:26:53.540 --> 02:27:00.140]  using stealth the British spearheaded the formation of the Council of Europe on

[02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:38.620]  Oosterbeck Holland the Bilderberg group would later admit that their mission was
[02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:46.260]  the formation of the EU once the EU was established under the guise of trade
[02:27:46.260 --> 02:27:52.300]  deals a North American Union and Asian Union would be formed the three

[02:34:33.740 --> 02:34:38.220]  happened yes I was told that by two separate people they scoured our records
[02:34:38.220 --> 02:34:43.260]  for hours yesterday and hours today trying to find something honest and of
[02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:46.740]  course there was nothing it was just scary I mean I've again I've been all
[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:50.700]  over the world and I've never seen anything like this it was like hours of
[02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:55.100]  humiliation and they said what are you here for and I said well I'm here to you
[02:34:55.100 --> 02:34:58.820]  know cover the media covering political event hook talks to members of parliament
[02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:01.660]  I was answering all the questions it's clear I wasn't a threat it was clear
[02:35:01.660 --> 02:35:04.180]  I didn't have any criminal record it was clear I was pressed it was clear I was
[02:35:04.180 --> 02:35:07.420]  coming to interview people they were gonna deny me that they told me earlier
[02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:11.680]  that I was probably gonna be denied and then you guys showed up and everything
[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:19.180]  changed so what's your plan now my plan is to go out and try to interview Jim
[02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:22.380]  Tucker to try to go down to the Builderburg group and maybe catch some
[02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:26.940]  of them still arriving and try to still make a documentary
[02:35:26.940 --> 02:35:37.540]  so instead of being here at 8 a.m. in the morning when the Builderburg group
[02:35:37.540 --> 02:35:41.900]  attendees 100 elite on the planet start showing up we're gonna be hidden here
[02:35:41.900 --> 02:35:58.340]  about 3 30 or so and see if we can catch any of the elites coming in
[02:36:11.900 --> 02:36:16.340]  what do you think on the agenda for this edition of the Builderburg society
[02:36:16.340 --> 02:36:20.300]  they're debating the attack on Iran they're talking about how to take out
[02:36:20.300 --> 02:36:24.340]  Hugo Chavez they're talking about how to get their American Union in that
[02:36:24.340 --> 02:36:28.300]  destroys Canadian US and Mexican sovereignty so we're talking about the
[02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:31.260]  death of Canada's what's happening in there right now the death of your
[02:36:31.260 --> 02:36:36.020]  sovereignty is happening in there right now CNN has even reported that these
[02:36:36.020 --> 02:36:39.820]  individuals have put out the policy reports through the council on farm
[02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:43.820]  relations that writes their scholarly white papers to end the United States to
[02:36:43.820 --> 02:36:51.780]  end Canada and to end Mexico about 10 have come in
[02:36:52.500 --> 02:36:58.180]  they've been coming in slowly in typically big black cars with what
[02:36:58.180 --> 02:37:01.820]  appears to be bulletproof glass and we've got a few pictures of some of the
[02:37:01.820 --> 02:37:07.980]  people we're being kept well back from the building by an awful lot of security
[02:37:07.980 --> 02:37:11.460]  people but you know there'll be more security-resisting devops
[02:37:11.460 --> 02:37:16.020]  just a reminder to stay off the front okay I am I'm this is the line we check
[02:37:16.020 --> 02:37:18.420]  where the city are
[02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:21.460]  yes okay
[02:37:21.460 --> 02:37:35.660]  I came here from upstate New York I booked a room way in advance when I checked
[02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:38.980]  in at 10 o'clock at night they told me I had to be out at 8 30 in the morning
[02:37:38.980 --> 02:37:43.260]  and so of course I complied to what they wanted I wasn't happy about it because I
[02:37:43.260 --> 02:37:48.060]  had been tired I drove a quite a long way then I went down to have something
[02:37:48.060 --> 02:37:52.060]  to eat and I just saw a bunch of security here and I was wondering what was
[02:37:52.060 --> 02:37:56.980]  going on and I asked questions and they said that they were having a wedding or
[02:37:56.980 --> 02:38:02.100]  they were having some sort of reception so I decided to ask a couple more
[02:38:02.100 --> 02:38:06.500]  questions because I thought it was kind of weird and then I saw them from my
[02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:10.900]  hotel window they were in the back with flashlights looking at the trees looking
[02:38:10.900 --> 02:38:16.020]  up the through the trees and they were also in front of the hotel coming it
[02:38:16.020 --> 02:38:20.220]  looked like coming the hotel so I kind of got was wondering what was going on and
[02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:27.740]  I left I got up this morning I checked out and then the fella that I spoke with
[02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:30.540]  the last fellow I spoke with said well you'll know all about it and the
[02:38:30.540 --> 02:38:34.980]  newspaper well I didn't have to wait because there was a group of people
[02:38:34.980 --> 02:38:38.940]  out here telling me everything that was going on
[02:38:40.100 --> 02:38:44.500]  and they're not fooling anybody any any longer when you've got this many cops
[02:38:44.500 --> 02:38:49.620]  you know and detaining Alex Jones of the barter
[02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:59.340]  get them on both sides yeah you crook yeah you're gonna go to jail I can't lay oh

[02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:53.180]  at the end Davignon is the honorary chairman of the Bilderberg group as well
[02:39:53.180 --> 02:40:01.220]  as the head of its steering committee the committee he heads selects and
[02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:07.100]  invites each year's attendees in the last decade the list of attendees has been
[02:40:07.100 --> 02:40:14.140]  leaked to reporters by moles on the inside veteran newspaper reporter Jim
[02:40:14.140 --> 02:40:18.380]  Tucker has been covering the Bilderberg meetings for over 30 years and has
[02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:23.220]  physically attended more than 20 we traveled back to our hotel to see if
[02:40:23.220 --> 02:40:32.620]  Jim Tucker received the 2006 list first heard about Bilderberg in 1975 and I
[02:40:32.620 --> 02:40:38.100]  said I don't believe it that's not possible who in Hills Bilderberg I
[02:40:38.100 --> 02:40:43.620]  spent 20 happy years with Metropolitan newspapers all the wires are clicking at
[02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:48.700]  my ear that could not happen without me knowing about it the thing that first
[02:40:48.700 --> 02:40:54.900]  impressed me most was calls in 1957 by the late great Westbrook Pegler a
[02:40:54.900 --> 02:41:01.660]  widely syndicated columnist he wrote two leafy columns about how approximately
[02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:07.860]  100 liters of international finance heads of state public officials were
[02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:13.900]  meeting behind armed guards closed doors on Jekyll Island sealed off what are
[02:41:13.900 --> 02:41:18.620]  these powerful internationalists doing and why is it so secret why does have
[02:41:18.620 --> 02:41:24.340]  armed guards outside why is it sealed off the newspapers totally nor it not a
[02:41:24.340 --> 02:41:32.060]  word total blackout in the United States since then I've never stopped
[02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:38.500]  pursuing Bilderberg are the whole international gangster organization
[02:41:38.500 --> 02:41:44.860]  led by Rockfellers and Rothschilds as they manipulate the world for their
[02:41:44.860 --> 02:41:48.100]  selfish interest
[02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:55.300]  Jim you've been waiting on the list you normally get it on the first day you
[02:41:55.300 --> 02:41:58.420]  haven't gotten it we're told the mind come in today how important is that list
[02:41:58.420 --> 02:42:03.180]  it's absolutely essential although identifying people outside as we always
[02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:09.060]  do it's important to find out who is not on their own list in recent years
[02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:14.660]  someone from Europe has sent a machine copy with a head so forth without
[02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:20.140]  identifying himself so far I haven't heard from him
[02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:35.820]  well Bilderberg assumed that a name in 1954 at their first meeting as Bilderberg
[02:42:35.820 --> 02:42:41.500]  at the Bilderberg hotel it's a little bit like Shakespeare's as you like it
[02:42:41.500 --> 02:42:45.420]  they say to Shakespeare what do you want to call this book he says as you like it
[02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:49.380]  meaning whatever you want to call it and they thought it was dictation so one of
[02:42:49.380 --> 02:42:52.940]  the his plays is called as you like it and the final has nothing to do with the
[02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:59.100]  play so that's how the Bilderberg came by their name now they have been
[02:42:59.100 --> 02:43:05.100]  meeting for half a century the money class had been meeting but they decided
[02:43:05.100 --> 02:43:10.260]  they have to be systematically every year well plan in advance in addition
[02:43:10.260 --> 02:43:14.700]  maybe other smaller than easily throughout the year
[02:43:14.940 --> 02:43:18.420]  this is right turn Jim
[02:43:26.580 --> 02:43:31.700]  this is the global government they are setting the world agenda inside right
[02:43:31.700 --> 02:43:36.620]  now they're deciding whether or not there will be a war with Iran they're
[02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:40.980]  deciding whether or not taxes will increase whether all prices will be
[02:43:40.980 --> 02:43:47.540]  suppressed are increased they are there's much more than the agenda that
[02:43:47.540 --> 02:43:51.140]  we'll be finding out in the fullness of time but those are three items that are
[02:43:51.140 --> 02:43:54.620]  heavy on their list this year
[02:43:59.020 --> 02:44:03.660]  this is Jim Tucker ladies and gentlemen 27 years covering these crooks
[02:44:03.660 --> 02:44:08.340]  I bless you to meet you said he was crazy it didn't exist now we forced him
[02:44:08.340 --> 02:44:13.540]  120 of the world's most powerful men heads of state from Europe high
[02:44:13.540 --> 02:44:18.340]  officials United States government Treasury White House State Defense
[02:44:18.340 --> 02:44:24.660]  they're setting the world agenda now the reason they want secrecy is cause they're
[02:44:24.660 --> 02:44:28.500]  doing evil evil is done under the cover of darkness good works are done in the
[02:44:28.500 --> 02:44:41.580]  sunshine hi are you doing good you have some questions for you need you to move

[02:46:16.180 --> 02:46:21.020]  able to call a friend a journalist in Rome as a result of his presence and
[02:46:21.020 --> 02:46:24.700]  others calling the Foreign Ministry Department in Italy they backed off and

[02:46:42.900 --> 02:46:47.020]  what we may be able to reveal and what we actually do reveal publicly about the
[02:46:47.020 --> 02:46:51.500]  Bilderberger intense Daniel Estalon has covered the Bilderberg meetings in

[02:48:09.180 --> 02:48:13.380]  been reported that Wolfowitz had attended previous meetings while still the
[02:48:13.380 --> 02:48:20.820]  deputy secretary of defense a violation of the Logan Act under the Logan Act it
[02:48:20.820 --> 02:48:24.740]  is a felony offense for any member of the federal or state government to meet
[02:48:24.740 --> 02:48:28.620]  with members of a foreign government without the express authority and
[02:48:28.620 --> 02:48:34.500]  authorization of the president or Congress put simply it is illegal for
[02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:38.100]  members of the government to meet secretly behind closed doors with
[02:48:38.100 --> 02:48:42.740]  foreign power brokers due to the problems of corruption and espionage that
[02:48:42.740 --> 02:48:48.900]  it breeds for this reason many prominent politicians attend but their
[02:48:48.900 --> 02:48:54.260]  names do not appear on the official list despite the Logan Act the governor of
[02:48:54.260 --> 02:48:59.540]  New York's name George Pataki does appear on the list and we were able to
[02:48:59.540 --> 02:49:05.500]  catch the governor on tape walking with David Rockefeller at Brookstreet
[02:49:07.060 --> 02:49:11.300]  multiple staff members inside Brookstreet reported to us that Hillary
[02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:16.260]  Clinton attended for half a day several armored limos with diplomatic plates did
[02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:20.700]  arrive with police escorts and offloaded their passengers in the
[02:49:20.700 --> 02:49:25.940]  underground parking garage out of the site of the press
[02:49:26.780 --> 02:49:31.420]  former World Bank president James Wolfdonson sardonically stared at our
[02:49:31.420 --> 02:49:33.940]  cameras
[02:49:36.020 --> 02:49:40.500]  they're upset about the fact that they're being exposed well I'm sure they
[02:49:40.500 --> 02:49:44.260]  are I mean look at the tinted windows they don't want to be seen they don't
[02:49:44.260 --> 02:49:47.620]  want even anybody to know they're here so I'm sure they're ticked you know and
[02:49:47.620 --> 02:49:50.620]  that's why we're here to try to expose them do you think that they were angry
[02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:52.900]  they were on the front page the local paper today you think they're in there
[02:49:52.900 --> 02:49:56.740]  reading it right now Jim yes I don't think they're happy about it they
[02:49:56.740 --> 02:50:02.940]  prefer nothing at all no publicity prefer absolute secrecy
[02:50:02.940 --> 02:50:07.740]  yeah you better look away we're not your slaves
[02:50:11.540 --> 02:50:14.900]  did you get a list of the FDND's and everything?
[02:50:14.900 --> 02:50:20.020]  no I've asked for one under a slight variation of my name and I don't know
[02:50:20.020 --> 02:50:24.620]  if I'll get it or not also it could happen today for the last three years I
[02:50:24.620 --> 02:50:29.020]  get back to the hotel and there's a copy they're waiting for somebody who does not
[02:50:29.020 --> 02:50:33.700]  identify so I mean I really I'm not just not revealing source I don't know the
[02:50:33.700 --> 02:50:39.020]  source myself but the facts cause they want the billaberg letterhead on it and
[02:50:39.020 --> 02:50:49.020]  that makes a nice moment

[02:54:23.820 --> 02:54:51.700]  Iran
[02:54:51.700 --> 02:54:55.500]  over the last couple of years they've been reeling with the amount of leakage
[02:54:55.500 --> 02:54:58.980]  that they've been experiencing so it's getting harder and harder but again it
[02:54:58.980 --> 02:55:02.500]  will never get too hard for us because of the sources that we have inside our
[02:55:02.500 --> 02:55:06.220]  top-notch sources people who are actually working for them the secret service
[02:55:06.220 --> 02:55:12.100]  the second layer people in the billabergers the the the the clerks the
[02:55:12.100 --> 02:55:17.420]  the administrative office they're there they you know they are our eyes and ears
[02:55:17.420 --> 02:55:23.140]  and every time there's something out we always get the information
[02:55:23.140 --> 02:55:48.740]  I think that's the queen you say here what usually happens the secret service
[02:55:48.740 --> 02:55:53.300]  guys who are protecting the billabergers delegates the staff the coax the
[02:55:53.300 --> 02:55:58.340]  chefs when they actually get to see and to hear what some of these nasty people
[02:55:58.340 --> 02:56:02.500]  are talking about they're the first ones to look for us and the first ones to
[02:56:02.500 --> 02:56:06.260]  make sure that we get the information from the meeting we again we're very
[02:56:06.260 --> 02:56:11.260]  rigorous with information that does come out we double triple and quadruple the
[02:56:11.260 --> 02:56:14.900]  confirm the sources make sure that all the information checks out a lot of the
[02:56:14.900 --> 02:56:17.660]  stuff the billabergers have planted information make sure that you know
[02:56:17.660 --> 02:56:21.860]  this disinformation nullifies the the the accuracy of the reporting which is
[02:56:21.860 --> 02:56:25.380]  why we never probably the first thing to hear
[02:56:35.340 --> 02:56:43.700]  that looks like Rockefeller the decisions that these people take again
[02:56:43.700 --> 02:56:49.260]  they're not only decisions affect business community the effect politics
[02:56:49.260 --> 02:56:53.740]  business environment across the entire spectrum and these decisions are made
[02:56:53.740 --> 02:56:58.020]  and taken by a very elite group of people behind closed doors this year the
[02:56:58.020 --> 02:57:02.060]  Brook Street Hotel we are not private of these decisions we're not about what
[02:57:02.060 --> 02:57:05.180]  they're talking about but we'll definitely feel the consequence of these
[02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:09.100]  decisions over the next 12 months when events which apparently by accident
[02:57:09.100 --> 02:57:12.620]  seem to happen in fact have been planned right here this year at Brook Street
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:18.180]  Hotel between 8 and 11th of June what does it do when you get 120 the most
[02:57:18.180 --> 02:57:20.940]  powerful people in the world getting together to have meetings with government
[02:57:20.940 --> 02:57:25.100]  officials I mean that that's amazing what it is is what I mean is that they're
[02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:30.060]  planning the corporate agenda they're not planning the a democratic human
[02:57:30.060 --> 02:57:35.060]  journey agenda in my opinion Mussolini had a definition is when the interest of
[02:57:35.060 --> 02:57:38.500]  the corporation take completely over from all other interests and that's
[02:57:38.500 --> 02:57:42.100]  fascism he said it should probably be called corporatism well call it
[02:57:42.100 --> 02:57:45.460]  corporatism call it fascism call it neo-libb neo-con there's a whole
[02:57:45.460 --> 02:57:49.540]  variety of political words depending on which side of the stripe you come from
[02:57:49.540 --> 02:57:53.740]  to start with which describes the thing but what they are describing is the
[02:57:53.740 --> 02:57:58.300]  complete end of democracy the end of what matters to people the end of what
[02:57:58.300 --> 02:58:01.660]  happens to the human journey and for that reason I think this is revolting
[02:58:01.660 --> 02:58:06.660]  Ladies and gentlemen we're here in Canada today to stand up against the Bilderberg group
[02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:10.660]  that's attempting to get rid of the sovereignty of the United States
[02:58:10.660 --> 02:58:16.020]  the truth of your world government has now been exposed we know you are ruthless
[02:58:16.020 --> 02:58:22.820]  we know you are evil today the Rockefeller the Rothschild representatives here to the
[02:58:22.820 --> 02:58:27.460]  Queen of the Netherlands to all of you we tell you you are not our queens you are
