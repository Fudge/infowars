[00:00.000 --> 00:13.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.120 --> 00:21.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.840 --> 00:31.280]  well I'm back in the saddle again fresh back from Hardin Montana the scene of a
[00:31.280 --> 00:37.720]  bizarre paramilitary group taking over the gigantic detention center rotting
[00:37.720 --> 00:41.760]  around in hardened police cars though the city doesn't have a police
[00:41.760 --> 00:46.880]  department but the local constabulary says they don't care of the guys that
[00:46.880 --> 00:52.240]  convicted felon or a known con artist with warrants out in multiple states they
[00:52.240 --> 00:56.240]  love him and the bad person is Alex Jones that's what the local big horn
[00:56.240 --> 01:01.200]  paper says then they lie and do a straw man attack and say a bunch of things I
[01:01.200 --> 01:09.000]  didn't say but this is an example of people wedded to corruption and it's a
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.200]  great microcosm of the rest of our country and the world and I talked some
[01:13.200 --> 01:17.440]  about this yesterday but I really really want to get into more detail today
[01:17.440 --> 01:21.840]  about what's happening there because it just illustrates how our entire economy
[01:21.840 --> 01:25.560]  is being converted from one of manufacturing and intellectual property
[01:25.560 --> 01:32.160]  and ideas and art and literature to one of potbellied thugs and uniforms
[01:32.160 --> 01:38.880]  literally parasiting off of the entire public I also want to talk about the
[01:38.880 --> 01:46.440]  warmongering of Barack H. Obama and how the Pentagon is playing this little
[01:46.440 --> 01:51.320]  Psyop giving him left cover will cut through the matrix through the
[01:51.320 --> 01:58.360]  propaganda on that front today also they're telling us on all the different
[01:58.360 --> 02:11.200]  financial programs that this is the new system they're telling us yes this is a
[02:11.200 --> 02:16.240]  jobless recovery where you lose your job but the central banks get even richer
[02:16.240 --> 02:24.240]  and so the economy is just wonderful because we all live in America America
[02:24.240 --> 02:30.840]  it's wonderful that when you guys pull up romstein living in America I think I
[02:30.840 --> 02:36.800]  want to play that sometime today romstein living in America pull up the
[02:36.800 --> 02:45.080]  video on YouTube if you want to get it there but that is just some of what
[02:45.080 --> 02:51.560]  we're going to be going over today also great job to the producers in there we
[02:51.560 --> 02:56.840]  have Lisa Snyder joining us remember a few weeks ago mom ordered to stop baby
[02:56.840 --> 03:01.160]  sitting friends kids she'd have him over for breakfast a few times a week just
[03:01.160 --> 03:04.560]  like my mom would do sometimes the neighbors would have me over for
[03:04.560 --> 03:11.920]  breakfast I remember I'd go over to the next-door neighbors the crows sometimes
[03:11.920 --> 03:16.720]  and have oatmeal and scrambled eggs and I liked it because they dump so much
[03:16.720 --> 03:21.280]  sugar and butter on the oatmeal more than my mother did I could get captain
[03:21.280 --> 03:26.600]  crunch over there she wouldn't let me eat captain crunch not anymore you don't
[03:26.600 --> 03:31.200]  have free association in America the government is going to run every fast
[03:31.200 --> 03:36.520]  of your life and by the way it's not just America it's in Canada Australia and
[03:36.520 --> 03:42.200]  England and Germany same rules same time same global government will tell you
[03:42.200 --> 03:45.520]  what's behind that I submit to get to the kicker on this yesterday I didn't how
[03:45.520 --> 03:51.520]  it ties into Obama saying I want all of you to go to church year-round Obama
[03:51.520 --> 04:01.560]  says year-round school for everyone and then how that also dovetails with
[04:01.560 --> 04:05.760]  hundred thousand dollar fines if you sell any recalled products at a bizarre
[04:05.760 --> 04:11.320]  or your business or your garage sale doesn't matter if there's over a hundred
[04:11.320 --> 04:15.760]  thousand things on the list they've got a handbook you're supposed to all read
[04:15.760 --> 04:21.760]  you now work for the government you see they can't get enough money writing
[04:21.760 --> 04:25.000]  tickets on the highway they can't get enough money claiming you cheated on
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.400]  your taxes when you self-incriminate filling out the tax forms so they're
[04:29.400 --> 04:35.840]  making all activity illegal everything not just spanking your kids yelling at
[04:35.840 --> 04:38.560]  them don't run out the street there's cases of where neighbors see somebody
[04:38.560 --> 04:43.080]  screaming at their kid get out of the street I'm sorry we're taking your
[04:43.080 --> 04:47.560]  child to a government rape room they always talk about Saddam and his
[04:47.560 --> 04:52.200]  imaginary rape rooms well there in the United States five times more likely in
[04:52.200 --> 04:57.520]  CPS to be raped or abused anyplace else that's why they run the kids is their
[04:57.520 --> 05:01.960]  pedophiles they like to rape children will be right back have you heard that

[08:34.040 --> 08:55.760]  we're all living in america america america america
[08:55.760 --> 09:05.640]  uh
[09:25.760 --> 09:37.760]  We're all living in America, America, it's wonderful.
[09:37.760 --> 09:45.760]  We're all living in America, America, America.
[09:45.760 --> 10:01.760]  We're all living in America, America, it's wonderful.
[10:01.760 --> 10:25.760]  We're all living in America, America, it's wonderful.
[10:25.760 --> 10:33.760]  That's Romstein. We're all living in America. We are known as the global mark. What is a mark?
[10:33.760 --> 10:41.760]  That's the person a con artist picks out to scam.
[10:41.760 --> 10:49.760]  And that's what's happened. And the American people have been trained to accept corruption, to rationalize it, and to go along with it.
[10:49.760 --> 11:03.760]  And so there's been a type of mass psychosis that has taken place where the people will put up with anything, anytime, anywhere, because they have no respect for themselves.
[11:03.760 --> 11:14.760]  And in many cases, they actually love the oppression. They defend the oppression. They defend the lies. They love the lies.
[11:14.760 --> 11:20.760]  And I want to speak about that today, just briefly recapping.
[11:20.760 --> 11:43.760]  A little over a week ago, we saw reports in the local news of a shadowy Serb national coming in and taking over a detention facility that had been built and is going to be backed up by the taxpayers of the community when they're arrested and put in the facility.
[11:43.760 --> 12:02.760]  And when they expand and pay for the local police force to fill the giant 450 plus bed facility, and the shadowy individual came into town with black Mercedes SUVs with hardened police decal on the side.
[12:02.760 --> 12:20.760]  And with other decals on the front of the vehicle saying hardened police. And then it turned out that, yes, the local two rivers authority, the parasite authority, most towns and counties have them.
[12:20.760 --> 12:32.760]  We've got the LCRA here in Texas hired its own SWAT teams, why not? They got a badge, they got guns, people bowed before them, notoriously corrupt.
[12:32.760 --> 12:37.760]  And they wanted somebody to operate the jail.
[12:37.760 --> 12:43.760]  And so they brought this individual in and even when it came out on Wednesday.
[12:43.760 --> 12:54.760]  Now, we'd already reported that here on Monday and Tuesday, but Steve Quayle had here on this show, but it was the front page of the Billings Gazette.
[12:54.760 --> 13:03.760]  But the local paper, the big horn just basically said so what it came out, he was a 14 time felon just from one round of different grand theft.
[13:03.760 --> 13:13.760]  And he had all these other convictions and all these other millions and millions of dollars in multiple states and civil judgments against him for all sorts of fraud and scams.
[13:13.760 --> 13:23.760]  I mean, this is a big time con artist, big time loan operator.
[13:23.760 --> 13:33.760]  And now it's come out that American police force wasn't working with black water, black waters threatened to sue him saying take that off your site that you run our training center.
[13:33.760 --> 13:35.760]  That's not true.
[13:35.760 --> 13:41.760]  Three other big mercenary groups are saying we don't even know this guy or yes, we met with him once.
[13:41.760 --> 13:47.760]  And it'd be easy for me to get up here and say, oh, see the preliminary reports were accurate.
[13:47.760 --> 14:01.760]  He does have connections to all these mercenary groups and it is like Jericho where the private mercs are taking over the western states and oh my gosh and they were going to make it a FEMA camp.
[14:01.760 --> 14:06.760]  They did want it to hold Guantanamo prisoners and they are going to build.
[14:06.760 --> 14:16.760]  They set a $17 million international mercenary training center and they did go and talk to different mercenary groups about coming there and some showed interest.
[14:16.760 --> 14:26.760]  But it's the constant continual classic con artists move to get legitimate people and groups talking to you so you can use their name.
[14:26.760 --> 14:31.760]  And they got an Iranian lawyer to be their quote chief counsel.
[14:31.760 --> 14:42.760]  And they got the two rivers group to sign contracts with them, but they've paid a few locals to be their PR people and they've paid some cleaning crews to clean out the jail.
[14:42.760 --> 14:48.760]  It's been sitting empty for two years, never, never filled since it was built.
[14:48.760 --> 14:57.760]  But other than that, it's, it's, it's a complete smoke and mirrors job.
[14:57.760 --> 15:01.760]  But here's the big issue.
[15:01.760 --> 15:10.760]  You talk to the locals from surrounding towns and hardened the common people and they say, yeah, they want to fill the jail with us.
[15:10.760 --> 15:15.760]  Local boss hogs that run this town are all getting jobs there.
[15:15.760 --> 15:19.760]  And that's been announced people running for mayor and others.
[15:19.760 --> 15:21.760]  Local reporters are being hired.
[15:21.760 --> 15:31.760]  They're all going to basically feed on the town and tax and regulate and control us and feed off of us as we've seen with many other towns and detention centers.
[15:31.760 --> 15:38.760]  They build where they grab you and arrest you and throw away the key and raise all these new taxes and squeeze you into oblivion.
[15:38.760 --> 15:40.760]  That's their idea of economic development.
[15:40.760 --> 15:44.760]  That is the way this country's going.
[15:44.760 --> 15:51.760]  Can't get your tuition paid for to be a doctor or a lawyer or a school teacher or an engineer, but you can get it paid for.
[15:51.760 --> 15:56.760]  You can get a scholarship to be part of Homeland Security.
[15:56.760 --> 16:03.760]  But when you talk to the local mayor of candidates and when you talk to the city council, when you talk to the sheriff's department.
[16:03.760 --> 16:11.760]  And when you talk to all the good old boys on Main Street, they will run up and assault you.
[16:11.760 --> 16:23.760]  The former head of the two rivers facility, Mr Smith ran out of the shadows and attacked Aaron Dyke shoved him, pushed him on video because Aaron was out getting some shots of the town.
[16:23.760 --> 16:28.760]  This guy comes running out of the on Main Street and shoves him and says, what are you doing with that camera?
[16:28.760 --> 16:35.760]  Then we get in his face and say, hey, the FBI is investigating you. You're in a lot of trouble. You better come clean that you got conned by Hilton.
[16:35.760 --> 16:43.760]  Or are you involved with him? Do you know he's a con artist and he ran off?
[16:43.760 --> 16:48.760]  But when you, we walked into the sheriff's department and they started saying you're not allowed to have cameras in here.
[16:48.760 --> 16:54.760]  So we turned our cameras off and then the lady behind the counter says, we don't like people from out of town coming in here trying to tell us what to do.
[16:54.760 --> 17:00.760]  This town was great till you came here, Mr Jones. And we just love the captain.
[17:00.760 --> 17:07.760]  And so it's very sick. And I guess Sheriff Big Hair likes it. That's his name, Sheriff Big Hair.
[17:07.760 --> 17:11.760]  That's when he was born. They saw somebody outside the TP that had Big Hair.
[17:11.760 --> 17:19.760]  But the point is, is that this is just a cesspit of corruption.
[17:19.760 --> 17:29.760]  And I said, yeah, okay, we're carpet baggers from Texas to the lady. But I said, this guy's from Serbia.
[17:29.760 --> 17:37.760]  And he came in here with police cars that weren't even incorporated just, and they're like, we don't care. We like him.
[17:37.760 --> 17:45.760]  And then a lady at the pizza place came from behind the counter to basically yell at me and let me know that we don't like people coming into Hardin from out of state.
[17:45.760 --> 17:52.760]  Or even from Billings and telling us our business. So why don't you just get out of our town?
[17:52.760 --> 17:59.760]  And she was relishing it. And I said, so you don't care. He's a felon. You don't care. She said, no, we like the captain.
[17:59.760 --> 18:04.760]  And I said, so he comes in here in his uniform and eats here, doesn't he? She said, yeah.
[18:04.760 --> 18:09.760]  Bed and breakfast we stayed at. We were there one day. They were nice. They found out who we are.
[18:09.760 --> 18:16.760]  The owner comes in, he says, I ought to call your show and cuss you out because, you know, they own the big fat cat.
[18:16.760 --> 18:23.760]  Bed and breakfast. And I said, let me guess, the captain stays here. And he goes, that's right. He stays here every time he's in town.
[18:23.760 --> 18:29.760]  And I said, does he have foreigners with him like other deals? Yeah, he's got some Germans and British with him and he's got some troops.
[18:29.760 --> 18:38.760]  And we like him and we don't care who. And I said, he's a felon. And they said, you don't have proof of that. And I go, he's an admitted felon.
[18:38.760 --> 18:43.760]  And I said, now people involved, the lawyers involved, others are pulling out. They're saying he doesn't have money.
[18:43.760 --> 18:52.760]  He's making up some shadowy group that's got money because his group tried to register itself down the street from the White House at a mailbox center,
[18:52.760 --> 18:59.760]  but they wouldn't let him. And they said, we don't care. You're not going to tell us what to do.
[18:59.760 --> 19:10.760]  And I said, tell you what to do. You want a convicted felon with a bunch of foreign mercenaries running the prison and arresting locals and putting them in.
[19:10.760 --> 19:18.760]  And they said, yeah, that's economic development. Now, so let's be clear. I almost had the locals carrying me on their shoulders.
[19:18.760 --> 19:27.760]  I mean, they were stopping cars on Main Street, Side Streets. 90% of the town loved us and hates the local boss hogs and knows what the captain's doing.
[19:27.760 --> 19:34.760]  They're the ones that originally called and warned us. But anybody who owned a business, anybody who was in the end crowd,
[19:34.760 --> 19:39.760]  it's the exact same microcosm of our government, our Congress and our country.
[19:39.760 --> 19:45.760]  The fellow reserves, just like the foreigner from Montenegro, he's just like the foreigner from the Balkans.
[19:45.760 --> 19:55.760]  They just waddle in, flash a bunch of money, flash a bunch of fancy, you know, limos, and they take over our society and romp the daylights out of us.
[19:55.760 --> 19:58.760]  I'm going to talk more about it when we get back. Stay with us.

[22:00.760 --> 22:06.760]  There are many guarantees in this world. The closest I can come to a guarantee is that the dollar is going to zero.
[22:06.760 --> 22:13.760]  During the Great Hyperinflation in Weimar, Germany, people who had worked all their lives and vested conservatively were wiped out, reduced to poverty.
[22:13.760 --> 22:17.760]  There are many parallels between the Weimar and the U.S. today. I'll send you a list.
[22:17.760 --> 22:26.760]  There are ways to protect yourself from hyperinflation, gold and silver, and legal and constitutional ways to avoid confiscation, which is becoming highly probable.

[22:34.760 --> 22:39.760]  There is, in fact, a financial tsunami coming, and it could fall upon us quickly with little warning.
[22:39.760 --> 22:41.760]  Don't procrastinate, protect yourself.

[24:00.760 --> 24:13.760]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[24:13.760 --> 24:27.760]  More and more I talk about how living in this modern world that's transitioning from liberty into really serious tyranny is like living in a Twilight Zone episode.
[24:27.760 --> 24:36.760]  And a lot of historians that lived through the malice takeover or the Stalinist purges or Hitler's orgies of death and destruction,
[24:36.760 --> 24:45.760]  they talked about how surreal it was to watch people going along with the corruption, to watch people going along with classical tyranny,
[24:45.760 --> 24:54.760]  and cheerleading it, enjoying it, because once you buy into corruption, once you buy into evil, you begin to love it.
[24:54.760 --> 25:02.760]  I remember sitting in Sunday School as a kid, hearing them read Bible verses about lovers of wickedness, lovers of corruption,
[25:02.760 --> 25:08.760]  those that love hurting the innocent, those that love trampling on everything good.
[25:08.760 --> 25:17.760]  And it just seemed so ridiculous to me. Who wanted to trample on good things? Who liked evil? Who reveled in fraud and disease?
[25:17.760 --> 25:27.760]  Well, that's the New World Order. I mean, it just, and for good people, I'm not saying those of us that have an inclination to be in good spirit,
[25:27.760 --> 25:34.760]  in nice and loving or perfect, but we at least recognize good and evil. We recognize good from bad.
[25:34.760 --> 25:48.760]  And a lot of people just love evil. They think evil is like cute and fun. It's like their five-year-olds dumping their food behind the couch,
[25:48.760 --> 25:52.760]  and you've told them eat their vegetables so they run and hide it behind the bookshelf.
[25:52.760 --> 26:03.760]  And it's like they think it's fun or cute, or I don't understand it. I mean, to see the local constabulary when it came out,
[26:03.760 --> 26:10.760]  the captain, as he's called, this Michael Hilton, one of 17 aliases admitted,
[26:10.760 --> 26:19.760]  arrest warrants all over the country in a nearby state of Wyoming, a fraudulent art dealer who steals $100,000 silver statues,
[26:19.760 --> 26:27.760]  who makes fake NFL memorabilia and scams people for the investment that has been convicted over and over again of grand theft,
[26:27.760 --> 26:39.760]  14-time felon in one case, all these other felonies, DWIs, just, I mean, a rap sheet the size of the Dallas phone book.
[26:39.760 --> 26:48.760]  And then he comes into town. This is what scares me because I hope this isn't real. I hope he's just a complete con artist.
[26:48.760 --> 26:53.760]  With German mercenaries, British mercenaries, with architects,
[26:53.760 --> 26:59.760]  they say they're going to build a $17 million facility onto it for training international soldiers.
[26:59.760 --> 27:03.760]  They hire the Billings Gazette reporter who was reporting on it.
[27:03.760 --> 27:07.760]  Talk about a conflict of interest, Becky Shea.
[27:07.760 --> 27:14.760]  And in the local news issue, I'm getting on the airplane Saturday morning in Billings in its front page,
[27:14.760 --> 27:19.760]  AFP spokesperson fears for safety. And then it says, oh, from Alex Jones.
[27:19.760 --> 27:25.760]  It says, oh, yes, I'm so dangerous. And then it's all about me and how evil I am.
[27:25.760 --> 27:30.760]  And really nothing in there about from her.
[27:30.760 --> 27:39.760]  The paper points out she's using it as a distraction about the 14-time felon landing in the middle of nowhere, taking over the prison.
[27:39.760 --> 27:43.760]  And it's going to come out that he has none of the investment that he has none of the money.
[27:43.760 --> 27:49.760]  It's going to come out that he wasn't associated with all these groups, even though he may have met with a few of them.
[27:49.760 --> 27:54.760]  And it won't matter. The local constabulary will still defend it.
[27:54.760 --> 27:59.760]  And that's what all the comments on the Billings Gazette are saying in the news articles.
[27:59.760 --> 28:04.760]  It's its front page every day. They're saying, what is going on here?
[28:04.760 --> 28:09.760]  Why are they making this about people overblowing them policing the town?
[28:09.760 --> 28:16.760]  By the way, CBS News had that headline. American police force policing Hardin taking over prison.
[28:16.760 --> 28:21.760]  It turned out they went to city councils and announced they were the police.
[28:21.760 --> 28:28.760]  It turned out he was strutting around in police uniforms. It's confirmed.
[28:28.760 --> 28:36.760]  But that's what the delusional constabulary does instead of saying, man, we got conned or we're being blackmailed.
[28:36.760 --> 28:42.760]  Because I guarantee you, this guy spread some cash around. That's what con artists like to corrupt key officials.
[28:42.760 --> 28:52.760]  And then say, you better do what I say or I will show what you have done.
[28:52.760 --> 28:56.760]  And so now they're saying, we're keeping American police force.
[28:56.760 --> 29:06.760]  Now the town officials and the two rivers authority officials, the authorities, our gods, our lords, no longer servants.
[29:06.760 --> 29:11.760]  But the officials are saying, oh, Michael Hilton, the captain. No one knows his real name.
[29:11.760 --> 29:18.760]  Just 17 aliases that he's been convicted under. He was never part of the company.
[29:18.760 --> 29:23.760]  And they're like, okay, well, who is well, all the other officers, the major.
[29:23.760 --> 29:27.760]  This guy from Iran, he says he's not part of it anymore.
[29:27.760 --> 29:35.760]  But they don't care. They're just going to operate under this and they're going to open the prison and they're going to start snatching locals and cramming them in it.
[29:35.760 --> 29:40.760]  And they don't care. And why not? Here in Texas, about half the counties just rob you on the side of the highway.
[29:40.760 --> 29:44.760]  The Austin police take your blood without warrants on the side of the highway.
[29:44.760 --> 29:51.760]  I mean, why not? It's lawless government. Any parasite can just open up shop and start robbing people.
[29:51.760 --> 29:58.760]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.760 --> 30:04.760]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[30:04.760 --> 30:09.760]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[30:09.760 --> 30:14.760]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[30:14.760 --> 30:18.760]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[30:18.760 --> 30:23.760]  Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[30:23.760 --> 30:29.760]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[30:29.760 --> 30:35.760]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[30:35.760 --> 30:41.760]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[30:41.760 --> 30:44.760]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[30:44.760 --> 30:52.760]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[30:52.760 --> 30:59.760]  or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[31:01.760 --> 31:07.760]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[31:07.760 --> 31:13.760]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[31:13.760 --> 31:15.760]  just as well funded.
[31:15.760 --> 31:21.760]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[31:21.760 --> 31:26.760]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[31:26.760 --> 31:30.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[31:30.760 --> 31:37.760]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[31:37.760 --> 31:44.760]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for,
[31:44.760 --> 31:47.760]  the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[32:22.760 --> 32:27.760]  Studies show that liquid zeolite captures triggering antigens which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma,
[32:27.760 --> 32:30.760]  decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[32:30.760 --> 32:34.760]  Liquid zeolite is a tasteless and odorless liquid that, when taken daily,
[32:34.760 --> 32:38.760]  supports a healthy, happy, and active lifestyle in an increasingly toxic world.
[32:38.760 --> 32:42.760]  And liquid zeolite is so gentle that you won't even know you're taking it.
[32:42.760 --> 32:45.760]  Although your list of elements may be endless, the solution is simple.

[33:57.760 --> 34:02.760]  I'm going to be talking more about Montana, the wallowing in evil, the wallowing in corruption.
[34:02.760 --> 34:05.760]  As it comes out, the whole thing's a fraud and a scam.
[34:05.760 --> 34:14.760]  The local constabulary literally defends it, worships it as if it's even more dear to them because they can't be proven wrong.
[34:14.760 --> 34:16.760]  And they've got a stake in this.
[34:16.760 --> 34:23.760]  And they understand that if they just arrogantly say the fraudulent felon con artist is good, he will now be our police chief.
[34:23.760 --> 34:25.760]  That's the end of it.
[34:25.760 --> 34:26.760]  He will be.
[34:26.760 --> 34:30.760]  And locals will see the badge and the gun and get on their knees.
[34:30.760 --> 34:34.760]  That's how America operates, land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[34:34.760 --> 34:36.760]  Land of the brainwashed monkeys.
[34:36.760 --> 34:40.760]  And I'm sorry to have to say that until we realize what we've been turned into.
[34:40.760 --> 34:42.760]  We're not going to get our society back.
[34:42.760 --> 34:47.760]  We'll also talk about the new stimulus, all the banking takeover bill.
[34:47.760 --> 34:52.760]  Give the banks even more money or there'll be another depression.
[34:52.760 --> 34:55.760]  Meanwhile, they're telling us how great the jobless recovery is.
[34:55.760 --> 35:02.760]  A new oxymoron to add to all their other frauds as they tell us water flows uphill.
[35:02.760 --> 35:08.760]  And that if you stand in a bed of fire ants rubbing them all over you, that they won't sting you.
[35:08.760 --> 35:11.760]  Also, we'll get into the new war.
[35:11.760 --> 35:17.760]  This little mind control lot between the Pentagon and Obama acting like Obama is the peacenik.
[35:17.760 --> 35:24.760]  When he's already increased 20,000 contractors in Afghanistan, 25,000 troops in Afghanistan.
[35:24.760 --> 35:26.760]  A 45,000 increase.
[35:26.760 --> 35:30.760]  He's planning on putting 60,000 in over the next two years.
[35:30.760 --> 35:40.760]  And they have the military come out and criticize him to fool the right into supporting an expansion in the war and to fool the left into accepting it.
[35:40.760 --> 35:42.760]  We'll explain how psyops work.
[35:42.760 --> 35:50.760]  And if I hear one more drunk person calling to talk radio, I heard this guy calling to be on the Beltway last night when I was driving home.
[35:50.760 --> 35:54.760]  It comes on on news radio 590 KLBJ after my show.
[35:54.760 --> 35:58.760]  I was listening to it and this guy called in and it was, it was several of them.
[35:58.760 --> 36:00.760]  Same deal. They were drunk.
[36:00.760 --> 36:04.760]  And it was like, I can't believe what a traitor Obama is.
[36:04.760 --> 36:10.760]  Our troops are pinned down under the tack and they need more forces.
[36:10.760 --> 36:18.760]  And I can't believe he's not listening to portrayals.
[36:18.760 --> 36:27.760]  And just to watch those fools being played like like a violin, like a fiddle.
[36:27.760 --> 36:30.760]  Having no idea what a Psyop is.
[36:30.760 --> 36:32.760]  No idea.
[36:32.760 --> 36:51.760]  I was in a Billings bar, the bar slash restaurant eating something Friday night before we got ready to get on the plane and fly back to Austin covering the hardened story.
[36:51.760 --> 36:53.760]  And there was this guy in a wheelchair in there.
[36:53.760 --> 37:00.760]  And he had a big, giant USA jacket on the back of his wheelchair said Navy USA.
[37:00.760 --> 37:16.760]  He was wearing an American flag hat and he was sitting there kind of yelling at the bartender drunk and yelling at the guy next to him and everybody was kissing up to him and walking over and kind of kissing the ring.
[37:16.760 --> 37:23.760]  And my wife called so I went outside the restaurant to talk to her is that music playing in there.
[37:23.760 --> 37:30.760]  He comes out with his wheelchair is motorized wheelchair.
[37:30.760 --> 37:36.760]  And he looks at me. He's the commander. I'm the scum. I don't.
[37:36.760 --> 37:43.760]  He looks at me and eyes me and he says, what do you think about the war?
[37:43.760 --> 37:53.760]  And I said, well, I said, you know, both parties are controlled and it's it's it's it's big business.
[37:53.760 --> 37:57.760]  And he said, oh, you're one of those.
[37:57.760 --> 38:03.760]  One of those anti Americans, basically, and I said, well, I said, no, in America, I'm allowed to have my opinion.
[38:03.760 --> 38:07.760]  But I said, you just are kind of in a red rage feeling powerful.
[38:07.760 --> 38:15.760]  I actually said that later after trying to get real airing with me and kind of just huffed off angry and went back into the bar to drink some more.
[38:15.760 --> 38:27.760]  Because see to them, manhood is the troops and manhood is doing what the generals say and manhood is not questioning the government.
[38:27.760 --> 38:32.760]  Because I think he started arguing with me and he said, so you don't like the government.
[38:32.760 --> 38:37.760]  And I said, well, the government's controlled by offshore banks and it's stolen 23.7 trillion.
[38:37.760 --> 38:41.760]  And he said, the government owns the banks now.
[38:41.760 --> 38:48.760]  And I said, no, they loan taxpayer money to him and the banks loan that money and interest back to the government.
[38:48.760 --> 38:51.760]  It's a it's a scam.
[38:51.760 --> 38:56.760]  And he started arguing with me and getting real loud.
[38:56.760 --> 39:00.760]  And I said, what, why did you even talk to me?
[39:00.760 --> 39:07.760]  I mean, if you don't want to hear what I have to say, and he said, my son, three tours in Iraq.
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.760]  Like basically saying, I'm a God, you're not, you know, I'm a special class.
[39:12.760 --> 39:18.760]  And he said, and let me tell you, our troops are doing good over there.
[39:18.760 --> 39:26.760]  It was his third tour and this man came out waving his hands asking for help and my son would have just mowed him down in the first or second tour.
[39:26.760 --> 39:30.760]  But he helped him and it was a breach birth and he saved the baby.
[39:30.760 --> 39:34.760]  See, it's just mental illness of all these little specials they have.
[39:34.760 --> 39:35.760]  Oh, the troops saved a dog.
[39:35.760 --> 39:37.760]  Oh, the troops saved a kid.
[39:37.760 --> 39:40.760]  Oh, the troops adopted a dog.
[39:40.760 --> 39:44.760]  Yes, we know there are nice troops over there, but we know the war is illegal and a lie.
[39:44.760 --> 39:47.760]  And Iraq is worse off than it was before.
[39:47.760 --> 39:51.760]  And three million Iraqis are displaced and another million 300,000 are dead.
[39:51.760 --> 40:00.760]  According to Landsit, the British Medical Society, who's been proven to be very accurate in the last 50 years, gauging conflicts and then nonpartisan.
[40:00.760 --> 40:03.760]  They're not left to write or not pro war or anti war.
[40:03.760 --> 40:05.760]  Million 300,000.
[40:05.760 --> 40:09.760]  That war was a fraud and a lie.
[40:09.760 --> 40:19.760]  And I hear some drunk call in sounded like the same guy going, Obama is a trader.
[40:19.760 --> 40:28.760]  Because he dare questions crystal and questions portray us and he dare questions.
[40:28.760 --> 40:41.760]  All these different individuals and he's not allowed to question and see that that creates an automatic fake choice.
[40:41.760 --> 40:44.760]  And listen to dumb down left wingers and dumb down right wingers.
[40:44.760 --> 40:50.760]  You may like going through life being con and being scammed, but I'll assure you I've done the homework and you are being scammed.
[40:50.760 --> 40:53.760]  You're being laughed at by the social engineers.
[40:53.760 --> 40:58.760]  So for just a second, put down your coffee mug that's got an American flag on it.
[40:58.760 --> 41:02.760]  And for just a minute, stop staring at your American flag lapel.
[41:02.760 --> 41:08.760]  So you're worshiping a symbol, but what that flag symbolizes is almost completely gone.
[41:08.760 --> 41:19.760]  See, there are those of us that actually support what the flag used to symbolize in the past.
[41:19.760 --> 41:27.760]  So, I mean, if you like being a schmuck, like, like the town elders in Hardin being scammed by a well known felon con artist.
[41:27.760 --> 41:32.760]  And I understand you're into your delusion and you're into being scammed.
[41:32.760 --> 41:35.760]  I understand that and you're not going to wake up.
[41:35.760 --> 41:38.760]  But I'm just pointing you out to everybody else.
[41:38.760 --> 41:43.760]  I mean, you really are a sad excuse for human being.
[41:43.760 --> 41:53.760]  And you take the flu shot when they tell you to and you do everything you're told you're in to being a dutiful dog like person.
[41:53.760 --> 41:55.760]  You know, people have dogs.
[41:55.760 --> 42:01.760]  And if you take your dog out in the field, tell it to sit and put a shotgun to its head and blow its head off.
[42:01.760 --> 42:06.760]  You're going to love you to the minute those BBs fly through its brain.
[42:06.760 --> 42:09.760]  And it's the same thing with liberals and conservatives.
[42:09.760 --> 42:20.760]  You're all sucking off a different flavor of poison Kool-Aid provided to you by the same Jim Jones Kool-Aid salesman known as the New World Order.
[42:20.760 --> 42:23.760]  I mean, it's really elementary and simple.
[42:23.760 --> 42:27.760]  But let me explain how this works.
[42:27.760 --> 42:29.760]  They have to have division.
[42:29.760 --> 42:33.760]  The first thing the social engineers have to do is divide and conquer the American people.
[42:33.760 --> 42:37.760]  And their favorite way to do it is along the lines of left and right.
[42:37.760 --> 42:55.760]  So how are they going to get the left that sees that Obama's increased contractors in Iraq took 50,000 troops out of Iraq and put them in Afghanistan and Pakistan and surrounding areas?
[42:55.760 --> 42:58.760]  There's an actual buildup of overall troops in the region.
[42:58.760 --> 43:00.760]  Central Asia and Middle East.
[43:00.760 --> 43:04.760]  And they rotated some out, but rotated fresh ones in.
[43:04.760 --> 43:10.760]  Now, how are they going to make the American people who are 75% or higher depending on the poll?
[43:10.760 --> 43:12.760]  That's a low poll against these wars.
[43:12.760 --> 43:16.760]  How are they going to make you go along with it?
[43:16.760 --> 43:26.760]  Well, instead of having the debate about why are we in Afghanistan that no one since Alexander the Great could conquer, the Russians couldn't conquer it in eight years.
[43:26.760 --> 43:28.760]  We've been there eight years.
[43:28.760 --> 43:29.760]  Why are we there?
[43:29.760 --> 43:45.760]  Instead of having a debate about that, they make it a debate about do we only have 20,000 more troops and 25,000 more contractors or do we have 60,000 more troops in three more 20,000 increments over the next year?
[43:45.760 --> 43:53.760]  So see, they falsely set the parameter about how many troops do we increase instead of why are we there?
[43:53.760 --> 43:56.760]  And there was a UN document came out about six years ago.
[43:56.760 --> 44:08.760]  It was in major Australian papers for some reason, and it was a big UN meeting in Australia, and they said, we're going to have a world government.
[44:08.760 --> 44:19.760]  And they admitted in this lengthy Sydney Morning Herald piece, and it was in again several other papers, but that was the big lengthy one.
[44:19.760 --> 44:23.760]  About a choice in global governance, I think that was in the headline.
[44:23.760 --> 44:35.760]  But the point is, they said the people don't want world government, but we all know it's needed for the environment and the earth and for world peace, blah, blah, blah, eugenics enter the word eugenics in the blank.
[44:35.760 --> 44:48.760]  And so what we need to do is make it a choice between a left wing world government and a right wing world government.
[44:48.760 --> 44:55.760]  The right wing world government will be symbolized by George W. Bush, and the left wing will be symbolized by the United Nations.
[44:55.760 --> 45:03.760]  And they went on to say, we know the 15 member security council really runs everything, and so we'll call that the right wing UN.
[45:03.760 --> 45:10.760]  And then we'll have the left wing UN be the general assembly that has absolutely no power. It's a debating society.
[45:10.760 --> 45:20.760]  And they sit there in a huge article in the Australian news admitting everything I already knew. But the point is, this is how they do it.
[45:20.760 --> 45:30.760]  See, nobody wants a world government. Over 90% in those polls. People aren't stupid. They know that means another layer of taxes and regulation.
[45:30.760 --> 45:40.760]  And all it is is a group of private bank con artists, just like the con artists from American police force who's now changed their name and throw everybody off the corporate documents.
[45:40.760 --> 45:49.760]  They just come into town, take over, everybody bows down to them. Once your local government signed on to the scam, they're not going to ever pull out because they're not going to admit they're wrong.
[45:49.760 --> 45:51.760]  Same thing here.
[45:51.760 --> 46:02.760]  Same microcosm. You got private banks in 1950, 1945 at the Presidio Naval Base in California, San Francisco, set up the UN openly say it's to carry out world government.
[46:02.760 --> 46:09.760]  They said at the time that the five member security council would have all the real power and that nobody else would have any power.
[46:09.760 --> 46:14.760]  And they said they would sell this on a way to control the third world and carry out eugenics. And they did.
[46:14.760 --> 46:23.760]  And so they have our media attack the UN and say it's communist and say it's going to take over and get us and oh, it's taking over America.
[46:23.760 --> 46:32.760]  That's not what's happening. America, the Anglo-American establishment, the U.S. and England set up the United Nations.
[46:32.760 --> 46:38.760]  They run it through the security council. And once a country is totally taken over by the new world order, they get to join.
[46:38.760 --> 46:41.760]  And that's how the security council keeps expanding.
[46:41.760 --> 46:49.760]  Once you're totally controlled by Rothschild, Rockefeller, Saxe-Coburg, Goethe interest, you get to enter it.
[46:49.760 --> 46:56.760]  Once you've got a national security council dictatorship under the same laws, same continuity government, same systems.
[46:56.760 --> 47:00.760]  Once you adopt the same rules, that's how we get the same CPS rules.
[47:00.760 --> 47:05.760]  No babysitting allowed nationwide or worldwide in the same countries in the same day.
[47:05.760 --> 47:13.760]  That's how they start putting cameras in new parents' homes. Same week, six months ago, in the U.S., England, Canada, Germany, everywhere.
[47:13.760 --> 47:20.760]  We get Securist Head Start, they get Secure Start or Fast Start.
[47:20.760 --> 47:26.760]  Same name, same rules, same bureaucracy. It's a world government openly running everything.
[47:26.760 --> 47:33.760]  And there's so many tricks they play. I want to write a book or make a film just like with their top 100 tricks and just describe each trick.
[47:33.760 --> 47:38.760]  Because I've learned these tricks watching them and then reading psychological warfare manuals.
[47:38.760 --> 47:44.760]  This is all public. They're laughing at you. They publish articles how they manipulate you.
[47:44.760 --> 47:49.760]  The New York Times three or four months ago had a big article saying, oh, everybody knows the earth's cooling now.
[47:49.760 --> 47:53.760]  It's really the sun, but we still got to, quote, save the earth. And this is the way to do it.
[47:53.760 --> 48:01.760]  So it's the, you know, the noble lie. And so we're going to say our deteriorating atmosphere and that the ocean is going to turn into acid.
[48:01.760 --> 48:09.760]  And then now you see that all over the news every night. They even brag with their talking points. This is a disgusting joke.
[48:09.760 --> 48:14.760]  So how do you get the left and right to fight with each other?
[48:14.760 --> 48:21.760]  You claim that Obama's anti-war when he's increasing both the major wars.
[48:21.760 --> 48:28.760]  But by having the fake right wing come out and attacking, the left then goes, hey, he said he's going to put 60,000 in over the next year.
[48:28.760 --> 48:37.760]  Oh, but the generals want 60,000 now. Oh my gosh, he's such a communist. He's going to get us. Oh, no, it's so terrible.
[48:37.760 --> 48:44.760]  Oh my gosh, all left covered.
[48:44.760 --> 48:51.760]  As if the military is going to give speeches bashing him without permission.
[48:51.760 --> 48:58.760]  As if any of that is going on. This is meant to sucker the left that was starting to truly wake up and say no to the war.
[48:58.760 --> 49:08.760]  And Ron Paul, don't forget a few months ago, he goes to the CPAC, the big conservative yearly meeting 5,000 people in the ballroom.
[49:08.760 --> 49:11.760]  Rush Limbaugh in the ballroom.
[49:11.760 --> 49:19.760]  Ron Paul, one of the keynote speakers, he gets up and says Republicans are anti-war. We're sick of it. It's a fraud. It's a lie.
[49:19.760 --> 49:29.760]  And standing ovation bigger than Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity's. We ought to pull that video up for when we go live next hour.
[49:29.760 --> 49:34.760]  Now that, ladies and gentlemen, is the issue.
[49:34.760 --> 49:42.760]  How do they get Republicans to support war when the average Republican is not a moron and doesn't support it?
[49:42.760 --> 49:50.760]  You make the evil Communist liberals be against it. The ones that want your guns and the ones that want open borders, you know, all those legitimate things they want that are bad.
[49:50.760 --> 49:57.760]  And you just tag on. Yeah, we're pro gun and pro sovereignty and pro American pro tax cuts and pro war.
[49:57.760 --> 50:03.760]  They kind of throw that, you know what the punch bowl thinking you're going to want that fruit punch and ignore what's floating around the middle of it.
[50:03.760 --> 50:06.760]  They think you're stupid.
[50:06.760 --> 50:18.760]  You know, I get emails. I got some last night. How dare you say our troops are over there to guard opium. It's admitted that opium's up now 13 fold its previous record and the troops guard the opium fields.
[50:18.760 --> 50:27.760]  And they say, well, this is how we get the local farmers to be our friends. We let them bring it to fruition. Yeah, and ship it to local banks that launder the money.
[50:27.760 --> 50:36.760]  That's why it's all over our streets. If I hear about one more SWAT team raid of stupid heroin heads, I'm going to think I'm going to smash something around my office.
[50:36.760 --> 50:45.760]  You cops, you're not stupid either. You know, that's crap shipped in here. And all you moron young people don't ever use opiates.
[50:45.760 --> 50:52.760]  Don't ever use the government's filthy drugs. What is your problem?
[50:52.760 --> 51:01.760]  So our troops are over there dying, getting their arms and legs blown off for smack so your daughter can run it up her veins. Got it?

[52:00.760 --> 52:07.760]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:07.760 --> 52:11.760]  The enemy struck America on September 11. But who is the enemy?
[52:11.760 --> 52:13.760]  Bin Laden. This is his M.O.
[52:13.760 --> 52:16.760]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[52:16.760 --> 52:24.760]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[52:24.760 --> 52:30.760]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[52:30.760 --> 52:34.760]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:34.760 --> 52:40.760]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[52:40.760 --> 52:45.760]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[52:45.760 --> 52:54.760]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.

[54:09.760 --> 54:17.760]  We've got a mother coming up who's been told by the government she's not allowed to ever have the kids over for lunch or breakfast.
[54:17.760 --> 54:25.760]  It's not a matter of the neighborhood parents like their kids visiting. You're not allowed to have association in America without a government license.
[54:25.760 --> 54:30.760]  And I'm going to tie it into the master plan coming up. I also want to get more into the war.
[54:30.760 --> 54:39.760]  The sick psychology of we've got to send more troops into the meat grinder, or you don't support the troops that are on the ground instead of let's get out of there.
[54:39.760 --> 54:44.760]  It's not cutting and running. There's always going to be wars in Afghanistan.
[54:44.760 --> 54:51.760]  There's always going to continue killing each other, just like Mexico is, as long as drugs are being grown there.
[54:51.760 --> 55:01.760]  That's the big dirty secret. It's a war over opium. That's the main reason, $500 billion a year.
[55:01.760 --> 55:09.760]  And if your western banks that are in intelligence agencies launder in that money, you can loan it out at least 10 times.
[55:09.760 --> 55:20.760]  That's $500 billion. That's $5 trillion via fractional reserve banking.
[55:20.760 --> 55:30.760]  $5 trillion a year. Tax-free. Now you know why the troops are there and they're going to continue to be there, getting their arms and legs blown off.
[55:30.760 --> 55:36.760]  Because they are not going to let the Chinese and the Pakistanis ship the drugs in and have to pay a cut.
[55:36.760 --> 55:46.760]  They're going to directly take control of the entire chain from the Afghan valleys and poppy fields directly into your 18-year-old daughter,
[55:46.760 --> 55:58.760]  who's now a hooker at the topless bar to get her heroin injections, directly from the poppy fields guarded by the troops to your son or daughter's veins.
[55:58.760 --> 56:05.760]  That's how this works. And if you're not for it, you're an evil communist. Remember that.
[56:05.760 --> 56:10.760]  All right, I want to go to Robert, Rick, Jason, Gary, Dan, and others. We're going to start going to you.
[56:10.760 --> 56:17.760]  Our guest is only on for one segment with us, the mother. But I'm going to start taking your calls in the next segment before she gets on with us and then after.
[56:17.760 --> 56:24.760]  And we're going to get into the flu, huge developments there, and get into the economy, big developments there. It's all coming up today.
[56:24.760 --> 56:30.760]  And plenty of time to take your calls. We only have one guest today, so we can take a lot of calls.
[56:30.760 --> 56:38.760]  I do want to just let listeners know that every film I've made gets a little better than the last.
[56:38.760 --> 56:45.760]  And Obama Deception is the biggest film I've ever made. Most views online, most DVDs out there, people have taken it.
[56:45.760 --> 56:53.760]  An incredible activist with it. Just amazing jobs. And it's still a great tool to shatter the left-right paradigm.
[56:53.760 --> 57:05.760]  A very important film. Please get it on DVD at infowars.com. You can get it discounted at infowars.com when you order it with Fall of the Republic.

[57:58.760 --> 58:07.760]  The back of the film reads, America's last stand. Fall of the Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the U.S. economy by design.
[58:07.760 --> 58:13.760]  Leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and the dollar will be replaced with a new world currency.
[58:13.760 --> 58:20.760]  President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council,
[58:20.760 --> 58:23.760]  thus becoming the first U.S. president to chair the world body.
[58:23.760 --> 58:30.760]  A scientific dictatorship is in its final stages of completion, and laws protecting basic human rights are being abolished worldwide.
[58:30.760 --> 58:33.760]  An iron curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet.
[58:33.760 --> 58:42.760]  That's just some of what this film, Fall of the Republic, covers. It is my best work, available at infowars.com.

[1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:22.760]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:48.760 --> 1:01:10.760]  I'd like to talk to you about the carbon taxes. I'm a rural West Virginia and I'm a blacksmith. This deals with everything I do,
[1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:22.760]  along with the premises, ID, animal ID, and all that stuff. I try to study the bill real good because it has a lot to do with my daily life.
[1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:27.760]  Unlike most people who live in the cities, my daily life is different.
[1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:42.760]  What it does for those that don't know, it says that 35 agencies have unlimited power to write whatever rules they want on any carbon dioxide or other gas.
[1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:55.760]  That's right. They're already, for the last year, been regulating coal up here for private purchase. For individuals, you only allow two tons of coal a year.
[1:01:55.760 --> 1:02:03.760]  That's why the oil companies, if you study, are the main funders in the left-of-tax shoes.
[1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:11.760]  No, the oil companies ExxonMobil and Shell, the biggest funders, they want to shut down coal because we've got all this clean coal with clean scrubbers.
[1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:23.760]  They point cameras at smokestacks and show water vapor coming out and tell the idiot public that it's soot. It's all a complete lie because we've got thousands of years of coal and they want to shut it off.
[1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:25.760]  How far power comes from coal?
[1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:38.760]  That's right, and I'll tell you something else. They're raising our power bills up here by the team of 15% while idling the coal power plants to create an artificial scarcity.
[1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:54.760]  Same thing Enron got caught. Their own documents came out in court, and I said this at the time. They would shut power off for an hour a day to freak everybody out, and their internal memos said, by shutting off power, it creates the perception it's not there, and they're going to do it with water, with energy.
[1:02:54.760 --> 1:02:56.760]  They are going to rape us. Go ahead.
[1:02:56.760 --> 1:03:10.760]  Yeah, I live in the Ohio Valley, where most of the coal goes down the river, where we have all these coal-powered power plants, and I watch them, and they outrun a lot, and they keep increasing our power rates.
[1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:16.760]  I've lived here for the last 10 years, and my power bills have went up by about 300 percent.
[1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:34.760]  For folks that don't know what idling is, if it's a cold day and you don't see water vapors shooting out of every smokestack, and it's hard to turn them off and on, they have to go through a whole procedure, so when they switch off, they still keep them heating a little bit, you'll just see a little bit of vapor coming out.
[1:03:34.760 --> 1:03:36.760]  That's right.
[1:03:36.760 --> 1:04:00.760]  There's something else I want to talk to you about as far as the climate bill goes. I don't know if you saw it. I read both the 1,000-page and the 300-page addendum that they made that they actually set up a regulatory body giving them the authority to provide permits for solar panels, as if they own the sun.
[1:04:00.760 --> 1:04:08.760]  That's it, sir. Yes, I scanned the bill. I went over the cheat sheets that showed the key sections. It is worse than the Soviet Union.
[1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:18.760]  And Obama said, remember two years ago, he said, I'm going to, quote, shut down coal in America. Ladies and gentlemen, 51 percent of our power comes from coal.
[1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:29.760]  That's right. And I live in this state, West Virginia, is one of the poorest states in the country. You won't believe the amount of unemployment up here.
[1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:36.760]  All you've got is coal mining and the power plants that supply. How many states does West Virginia supply with power, the surrounding five states?
[1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:38.760]  Yeah, five or six.
[1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:48.760]  Well, we can't have that. The U.N. and Maurice Strong, he said at the 92 Rio de Janeiro summit, he said our job is to destroy U.S. industry, and they've done it with NAFTA and GATT.
[1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:54.760]  Now they're going to shut our power off, and Grandma's going to freeze the death, but they don't care because they're a bunch of scum.
[1:04:54.760 --> 1:05:01.760]  I appreciate your call. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen. They mean business. This is siege. This is eugenics.
[1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:11.760]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:16.760]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:24.760]  The best botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:32.760]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[1:05:48.760 --> 1:06:11.760]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:18.760]  This is the power plant in Thompson, Illinois. These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[1:06:18.760 --> 1:06:24.760]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[1:06:24.760 --> 1:06:32.760]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run some pumps, short-wave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:41.760]  You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again. When the power goes out, you'll be ready.

[1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:37.760]  I've got a MSNBC article. Mom ordered to stop babysitting friends' kids a few times a week for 30-40 minutes before they caught the school bus when it was cold outside.
[1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:42.760]  She lets them inside to wait for school bus. State calls it unlawful daycare.
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:54.760]  Growing up in Dallas, Texas, once or twice a week, I'd go to my neighbor's house to eat breakfast. I'd be invited over. We'd wait when it was cold to run out the school bus. My mom would have them over for breakfast.
[1:08:54.760 --> 1:09:02.760]  This nice lady wasn't even doing that. She's friends with the neighbors. Let the kids wait 10, 15, 20 minutes in the four-year of her house when it's cold in Michigan.
[1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:07.760]  You're not allowed to do that anymore. You don't have free association in America.
[1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:17.760]  Now, here is a London Mirror story. Are UK children laws too strict? It says you're not even allowed to talk to your neighbor's kids.
[1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:23.760]  You're not allowed to babysit them or have them come over in the morning before they get on the government training center bus.
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:35.760]  Now, this dovetails with Obama saying he wants year-round school. President Obama and year-round school is forever. Obama would curtail summer vacation.
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:45.760]  That's associated press right here. This is why he wants to televise announcements to the kids. This is the federal government. I've read their policy reports on air.
[1:09:45.760 --> 1:09:54.760]  We've had the former head, number two position, Department of Education on Charlotte, Israel. Let's set her back up about this. They told her in the 80s. That's why she left.
[1:09:54.760 --> 1:09:59.760]  They said, we're going to take over the family through the school. We're going to outlaw the family.
[1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:08.760]  Now, remember, $15 million fine the second time you have a garage sale that's unauthorized or you sell any recalled products.
[1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:19.760]  The animal ID, the premises ID, government documents to be able to have a solar panel. We just talked about that last segment.
[1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:27.760]  Let's go to her right now in Michigan. Lisa Snyder in this 1984 world. Lisa, thank you for joining us.
[1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:29.760]  Thank you for having me.
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:37.760]  Okay. You've been on the national news, but just sound bites. You've got the floor for the next 10 minutes or so. Tell folks what happened. Break down what you're facing.
[1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:44.760]  But first, you just heard my breakdown of government taking over society. Were you aware of that angle?
[1:10:44.760 --> 1:10:45.760]  No, I was not.
[1:10:45.760 --> 1:10:47.760]  What do you think of the statements I just made?
[1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:56.760]  It's stupid. It's bad. And yeah, the government doesn't need to stick their nose where it doesn't belong.
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:01.760]  Absolutely. Okay. Tell us how this started. How you became a 1984 criminal.
[1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:12.760]  My law was 1973. The law that they say I was breaking. It's the act number 116 of 1973.
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:19.760]  But the point is they're now trying to enforce this similarly worldwide. The CPS, who tattled on you?
[1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:21.760]  I mean, break it down for us.
[1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:35.760]  My house is a bus stop for the children of our neighborhood. And I have an older son and my friends have older children that now, our youngest ones, don't ride the bus anymore.
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:39.760]  They all grow together, but now the older ones go off and the younger ones are left behind.
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:49.760]  So my daughter did not want to get on the bus by herself, so we just thought it was a great idea to get the kids together, to get on the bus together so that they felt safe.
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:58.760]  Two of them are five. Two of them are seven. Of course, they just feel scared.
[1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:12.760]  So we planned this two days into it. The letter that I received was September 11th, but I didn't receive it until the following week that I was providing care for unreliefed children in my home.
[1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:17.760]  So I called the DHS and said, I don't understand this. I am not doing anything wrong.
[1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:27.760]  There is a bus stop. They do come in. If it's cold outside, if it's raining, we live in Michigan, the weather can be sunny one minute and snowing the next.
[1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:33.760]  And I said, you know this, you live in Michigan. And she said, I said, what do you want me to do when it's raining outside?
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:36.760]  And she told me to tell their parents to buy them an umbrella.
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:44.760]  So they're now your God. I mean, they're now going to tell you that you can't have neighbors, kids, wait in your front room when it's cold outside.
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:53.760]  These are our new Soviet minders. I mean, I want this to really hit people that the Amish are having their kids taken.
[1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:58.760]  They're not letting people sell eggs and watermelons on the side of the highway anymore across the country.
[1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:03.760]  They're SWAT teaming them, having undercovers come by watermelons and then SWAT team them.
[1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:10.760]  I mean, the government has run out of real criminals to feed on. We're now dinner.
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:12.760]  So what happened next?
[1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:18.760]  So I just kept talking to her and saying, okay, can they at least be in my garage? No, because the garage is a part of the house.
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:27.760]  I can't even do that. So I just got really angry and I told her that I had to stop talking because she, I mean, what she was saying did not make sense.
[1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:33.760]  So then my friend wrote to Brian Cowley and he jumped aboard immediately and said, this is ridiculous.
[1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:47.760]  It's such a broad law that it doesn't. There's such a broad spectrum that it needs to be, you know, you need to have facts.
[1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:53.760]  There's no facts in this law. I mean, it can be for babysitting. It can be for a play date.
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:14:02.760]  My daughter has a little girl over. I was told that I need to ask her parents if they go out to dinner, if they're going out to dinner or to a movie or whatever.
[1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:07.760]  That is considered daycare, but if they go home, then it's okay. I'm like, I'm not going to ask that. That's retarded.
[1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:16.760]  No, man, come on. You've got to ask permission if you take your daughter and her little friend to McDonald's to have a happy meal.
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:24.760]  Look, are you al-Qaeda or something? I mean, airport security. America is now secure. They want to put metal detectors in shopping malls.
[1:14:24.760 --> 1:14:28.760]  You need to ask CPS permission to go have a hamburger.
[1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:34.760]  Yeah. Well, no, I have to ask them to have my kids have play dates because they...
[1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:43.760]  That's freedom. Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, the veterans fought and died so that you wouldn't have permission to take the neighbor's child for hamburger.
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:48.760]  You've got to get government permission, not the parents, but see, I'm going to stop being sarcastic.
[1:14:48.760 --> 1:14:53.760]  What they're doing is setting a precedent. And worldwide, they're making these announcements that you can't keep your neighbor's kids.
[1:14:53.760 --> 1:15:02.760]  You can't even have kids' neighbors over. I had a Wall Street Journal reporter here who was in England and she was taking photographs of a famous river.
[1:15:02.760 --> 1:15:08.760]  No children were even there. And people, police came up and said, you can't photograph the river.
[1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:12.760]  There may be a child somewhere on the river. This is pedophilia. Are you a pedophile?
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:20.760]  So it's about government teaching us all we're criminals so that we can all be inducted basically into this prison system.
[1:15:20.760 --> 1:15:26.760]  So you've got a state rep involved trying to pass a law because they've passed a previous law.
[1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:30.760]  They're now implementing saying you can't have a play date with the neighbors.
[1:15:30.760 --> 1:15:34.760]  Yeah, well, and then the governor is on board too because she did not know.
[1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:37.760]  I guess you must not have realized that this was going on.
[1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:43.760]  And now she has jumped aboard and wants to take care of immediately because it is ridiculous.
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:45.760]  It's the dumbest law that's out there.
[1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:53.760]  We as Americans live in the free world. We should be able to choose who watches our children.
[1:15:53.760 --> 1:15:57.760]  We should be able to do what we want.
[1:15:57.760 --> 1:16:02.760]  But ma'am, ma'am, they've built giant CPS centers. They've built giant detention centers.
[1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:06.760]  We've got more prisoners than anybody in the world. They've got, they're only building more.
[1:16:06.760 --> 1:16:11.760]  They've got to criminalize us. Do you understand that's our new economy?
[1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:13.760]  Yeah, no.
[1:16:13.760 --> 1:16:17.760]  So, I mean, it doesn't matter if you're a good mother when it's freezing cold and gets below zero,
[1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:20.760]  trying to let neighborhood kids duck in for a few minutes.
[1:16:20.760 --> 1:16:24.760]  You're not allowed. You think this is America or something?
[1:16:24.760 --> 1:16:26.760]  Yeah.
[1:16:26.760 --> 1:16:34.760]  So what is the slimy CPS doing? Did you find out who reported you to the Bureau of Family Destruction?
[1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:37.760]  I did not, no.
[1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:44.760]  I mean, have you asked the, ma'am, did you know how CPS was set up?
[1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:46.760]  No.
[1:16:46.760 --> 1:16:50.760]  Well, let me just tell you, because you're influential. You're talking to a lot of folks.
[1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:54.760]  Family court was set up to carry out eugenics, the sterilization.
[1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:59.760]  Hitler got his eugenics from us. I made a film about it called Endgame.
[1:16:59.760 --> 1:17:04.760]  And so that's why these family courts are outside of the regular courts and due process.
[1:17:04.760 --> 1:17:11.760]  And that's why their agents can get away with all this, because 80, 90 years ago, or even in the 30s, 75, 80 years ago,
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:17.760]  these were the people that would come grab you and your kid and go sterilize you. Did you know that?
[1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:19.760]  No.
[1:17:19.760 --> 1:17:21.760]  Had you ever heard about that?
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:22.760]  No, I haven't.
[1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:27.760]  Well, listen, I know that sounds crazy, but if you just Google Endgame eugenics,
[1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:34.760]  you can watch the actual government film clips where they had the movie reels teaching parents that this was okay.
[1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:39.760]  So we have this vestigial, you know, leftover Hitlerian system.
[1:17:39.760 --> 1:17:45.760]  Well, I mean, here's an example for you.
[1:17:45.760 --> 1:17:51.760]  How is there even a spy network to know that you had neighbor kids over before they caught the bus?
[1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:52.760]  I have no idea.
[1:17:52.760 --> 1:17:54.760]  I mean, does that sound like Nazi Germany?
[1:17:54.760 --> 1:18:02.760]  Well, no, it's just a nosy neighbor that I guess that we don't know which neighbor,
[1:18:02.760 --> 1:18:08.760]  but I just think that someone must be very unhappy or I don't know a thought that they would get.
[1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:16.760]  I don't know what they thought actually. It's just a sad situation.
[1:18:16.760 --> 1:18:22.760]  Well, the family is a unit that according to the Department of Education must be destroyed and replaced by the state.
[1:18:22.760 --> 1:18:25.760]  The individual must owe their allegiance to the state.
[1:18:25.760 --> 1:18:30.760]  That's why they put all the pressures they can on communities so community collapses.
[1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:32.760]  So all that's left is the government.
[1:18:32.760 --> 1:18:38.760]  And that's why CPS is five times more likely to abuse children than any other group.
[1:18:38.760 --> 1:18:41.760]  What are the children doing now that winter is coming on?
[1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:44.760]  I guess they just freeze outside.
[1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:53.760]  Well, I'm still, I mean, I am well within my 28 days of I only watched them.
[1:18:53.760 --> 1:18:56.760]  The one little boy, the one little boy stopped coming, but the other little boy,
[1:18:56.760 --> 1:19:02.760]  I still have like 26 more days to go before he only goes to school every other day.
[1:19:02.760 --> 1:19:03.760]  So I'm okay.
[1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:07.760]  Well, I think the CPS workers playing God should be fired.
[1:19:07.760 --> 1:19:11.760]  Have you heard they're telling people they can't have neighbors over for Bible study now?
[1:19:11.760 --> 1:19:12.760]  I have not.
[1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:13.760]  All over the country.
[1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:17.760]  Yeah, we're told, we're being told, isn't free association the most basic thing?
[1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:19.760]  Isn't it the parents decision?
[1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:20.760]  Right.
[1:19:20.760 --> 1:19:22.760]  If their children stay at your house, not the government?
[1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:23.760]  Right.
[1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:28.760]  That's what our whole up, this whole uproar is, is because, you know, as a parent,
[1:19:28.760 --> 1:19:29.760]  they know me.
[1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:30.760]  They know my morals.
[1:19:30.760 --> 1:19:32.760]  They know how I bring up my children.
[1:19:32.760 --> 1:19:35.760]  They know that their children are going to be safe.
[1:19:35.760 --> 1:19:39.760]  Did you hear about California saying parents can't homeschool?
[1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:40.760]  No, I haven't.
[1:19:40.760 --> 1:19:42.760]  What do you think about that?
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:45.760]  I mean, the government is saying they own us.
[1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:47.760]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:50.760]  We really appreciate you joining us.
[1:19:50.760 --> 1:19:52.760]  An amazing lady standing up to big brother.
[1:19:52.760 --> 1:19:54.760]  Most people submit.
[1:19:54.760 --> 1:19:57.760]  They're telling people here in Austin, they can't have neighbors over.
[1:19:57.760 --> 1:19:58.760]  That's right.
[1:19:58.760 --> 1:20:23.760]  We're all prisoners.
[1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:54.760]  That's right.
[1:20:54.760 --> 1:21:20.760]  That's right.
[1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:39.760]  It's not about left or right.
[1:21:39.760 --> 1:21:41.760]  It's about a one world government.
[1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:48.760]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:21:48.760 --> 1:21:56.760]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:21:56.760 --> 1:22:01.760]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:22:01.760 --> 1:22:03.760]  Gold isn't for you.
[1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:08.760]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:09.760]  I get it.
[1:22:09.760 --> 1:22:14.760]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out
[1:22:14.760 --> 1:22:18.760]  trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that social security would be there for you.
[1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:20.760]  That's not what's happening.
[1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:26.760]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value,
[1:22:26.760 --> 1:22:28.760]  or that your retirement would be secure.
[1:22:28.760 --> 1:22:32.760]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[1:22:32.760 --> 1:22:36.760]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:42.760]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[1:22:42.760 --> 1:22:45.760]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:46.760]  You should, too.
[1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:47.760]  Find out what they know.
[1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:50.760]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well.

[1:22:56.760 --> 1:22:59.760]  That's 800-686-2237.
[1:23:01.760 --> 1:23:06.760]  For years, doctors and researchers had known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet
[1:23:06.760 --> 1:23:10.760]  rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body and proper pH balance.
[1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:15.760]  For 15 years, people had trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body and pH balance,
[1:23:15.760 --> 1:23:20.760]  getting rid of acidic waste buildup and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.
[1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:25.760]  AlkaZone's unique formula contains potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, and the antioxidant selenium,
[1:23:25.760 --> 1:23:29.760]  along with 79 trace minerals from ancient marine deposits.
[1:23:29.760 --> 1:23:34.760]  Unlike other products, AlkaZone is odorless and tasteless and can be added to any beverage to offset its acidity.

[1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:04.760]  The entire United States and Western world are being converted to a giant prison grid.
[1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:07.760]  We'll do a few more minutes here with Lisa Snyder.
[1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:10.760]  I talked to her during the break. She pretty much knows the neighbor who did it,
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:12.760]  but she doesn't want to get in a fracas with them.
[1:24:12.760 --> 1:24:20.760]  I warned her that this neighbor is going to now be watching if one of her little kids is in the backyard for five minutes alone,
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:22.760]  they're going to claim it's abuse.
[1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:27.760]  I think you've got to run this person to ground.
[1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:30.760]  You've got to maybe countersume for false reports or something,
[1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:36.760]  or they're going to be hunting you with the CPS because for these little stause types, they're never wrong.
[1:24:36.760 --> 1:24:39.760]  They love the big state. They love what's happening.
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:42.760]  But comment on that and then where all this is going.
[1:24:42.760 --> 1:24:49.760]  As you're being told it's illegal in the freezing Michigan blue northerns to let any neighbor kids
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:54.760]  come in and wait for the bus.
[1:24:54.760 --> 1:24:59.760]  As an American that we are supposed to be living in the land of the free,
[1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:03.760]  I believe truthfully, and all the other mothers do that are involved in this,
[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:08.760]  is that the government should not be able to tell us who we can have watch our children.
[1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:12.760]  If we know our children are a safe place, that's, I mean, the parents,
[1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:17.760]  it's the parents right as having these children as a mother of these children.
[1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:20.760]  They know they know they're in a safe place.
[1:25:20.760 --> 1:25:26.760]  Second, as far as the neighbor, yeah, I just, my husband and I are not,
[1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:32.760]  we just want this all to go away and just hopefully they'll leave us alone
[1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:34.760]  and hopefully this will all come to an end.
[1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:39.760]  And I hope that the law does get changed because it's a terrible law
[1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:43.760]  and I hope no other mother has to go through what I've had to go through.
[1:25:43.760 --> 1:25:47.760]  I do thank everyone for the support that they have given all of us,
[1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:51.760]  and I don't take that for granted one for one minute,
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:54.760]  but this was a very sad situation.
[1:25:54.760 --> 1:25:58.760]  It has hurt my children along with all the other children that are involved,
[1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:01.760]  and that's the most upsetting thing is whoever did this,
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:05.760]  if they were coming after any of us, adults, that's one thing,
[1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:09.760]  but to hurt our children, that's for it, for it, for it.
[1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:14.760]  Well, they started this in the last 20 years using a few bad examples
[1:26:14.760 --> 1:26:17.760]  of bad daycares, but there's nobody regulating the CPS
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:21.760]  who, again, is five times more likely to abuse children than any other group
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:23.760]  or even government itself.
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:27.760]  So they have no business, that's the pot calling the kettle black here,
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:31.760]  but notice, mothers and fathers know what a good daycare is.
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:37.760]  The CPS use the daycares as tattletale grounds to hunt for kids to CPS and take,
[1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:41.760]  and so when we let the CPS get into regulating daycares,
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:45.760]  they now have taken that over, and now they're trying to say
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:49.760]  we can't even have our own homes or can't have neighbors over for church,
[1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:53.760]  for a Bible study, they're destroying the right of free association,
[1:26:53.760 --> 1:26:57.760]  they're muscling in, and the same thing, parents know what a good daycare is,
[1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:00.760]  we don't need the state, and parents know if their kids
[1:27:00.760 --> 1:27:04.760]  allowed to go stay for 20 minutes in the foyer of a neighbor's house,
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:09.760]  that happened when I was a little kid, that's normal, my mom had neighbor kids over,
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:14.760]  neighbors had me over, that is freedom, and this is serious tyranny, go ahead.
[1:27:14.760 --> 1:27:18.760]  Well, and also I'd like to say, all because the daycare is licensed,
[1:27:18.760 --> 1:27:22.760]  does not mean that you know who is actually working,
[1:27:22.760 --> 1:27:25.760]  you don't know nothing about their background,
[1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:28.760]  you don't have dinner with them every night,
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:31.760]  you don't socialize with those people, usually,
[1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:36.760]  you just send your kid to this licensed daycare that's licensed by the state,
[1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:40.760]  but who is actually really watching your children do you know?
[1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:43.760]  That's right, that means you've just paid protection money to the government,
[1:27:43.760 --> 1:27:48.760]  that's right, a neighbor who you know and trust is a lot better than some nameless school.
[1:27:48.760 --> 1:27:53.760]  Right, exactly, and that was our other point that we were trying to make,
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:57.760]  at least they know, I mean, we have dinner together, we're with these people,
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:01.760]  practically every day of the week, they know us, we know them,
[1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:04.760]  you put your kid in a daycare, you don't know them,
[1:28:04.760 --> 1:28:06.760]  you just hope that you know them.
[1:28:06.760 --> 1:28:10.760]  Well, this lets us know the mindset of the government bureaucrats,
[1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:14.760]  they believe you can't have neighbor kids over before they cut the school bus,
[1:28:14.760 --> 1:28:16.760]  even if the neighbor parents want them there,
[1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:19.760]  they believe that someone owning their own property
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:25.760]  can't have 10 cars parked on their rural property to have Sunday dinner and prayer,
[1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:31.760]  they believe rabbis in Denver can't have 14 of their members over,
[1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:34.760]  they believe Buddhists can't have five of their friends over,
[1:28:34.760 --> 1:28:39.760]  they believe Amish can't sell watermelons without a license on the side of the road,
[1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:43.760]  they believe they're God and they're here to milk us and run our lives
[1:28:43.760 --> 1:28:48.760]  and under this new greenhouse gas tax bill, it says unlimited power,
[1:28:48.760 --> 1:28:54.760]  home inspections, everything, and the colleges are churning out armies of control freaks,
[1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:58.760]  who love ruling over people, we better get control of our country
[1:28:58.760 --> 1:29:02.760]  and we better stand up and say no like you did, I salute your courage.
[1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:05.760]  Thank you and any other mother that's in our situation stand up for your rights
[1:29:05.760 --> 1:29:09.760]  because you're keeping your kids, my children came to me and said,
[1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:13.760]  I thank you mom for standing up for us and I believe that if my child,
[1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:15.760]  my children were ever put in the situation that I was,
[1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:18.760]  I'm hoping that I have taught them that you stand up for the rights
[1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:21.760]  because you are an American and you do have the right.
[1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:25.760]  Well, I mean in the Soviet Union they let neighbor kids stay at neighbors' houses,
[1:29:25.760 --> 1:29:29.760]  this is worse than Malice China, worse than Soviet Russia.
[1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:32.760]  Lisa Snyder, God bless you, we appreciate your courage,
[1:29:32.760 --> 1:29:35.760]  we'll watch this case as it develops, Godspeed.
[1:29:35.760 --> 1:29:36.760]  Thank you.
[1:29:36.760 --> 1:29:41.760]  What an amazing lady, most people just roll over, the bureaucrats say good,
[1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:45.760]  we own you now, you're our slaves, we'll come back, take your phone calls,
[1:29:45.760 --> 1:29:51.760]  get into the flu, the war, the new stimulus package, it's all coming up.
[1:29:51.760 --> 1:29:55.760]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.760 --> 1:30:01.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.760 --> 1:30:04.760]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:30:04.760 --> 1:30:08.760]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[1:30:08.760 --> 1:30:10.760]  how much ammunition do you want?
[1:30:10.760 --> 1:30:15.760]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:18.760]  Food is your only ammunition, how much do you want?
[1:30:18.760 --> 1:30:19.760]  When do you want it?
[1:30:19.760 --> 1:30:22.760]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[1:30:22.760 --> 1:30:24.760]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:30:24.760 --> 1:30:26.760]  Will there be any food?
[1:30:26.760 --> 1:30:27.760]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:30:27.760 --> 1:30:30.760]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[1:30:30.760 --> 1:30:32.760]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[1:30:32.760 --> 1:30:36.760]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:30:36.760 --> 1:30:39.760]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:30:39.760 --> 1:30:41.760]  How much will you need?
[1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:42.760]  We don't know.
[1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:43.760]  How much do you want?
[1:30:43.760 --> 1:30:44.760]  All you can get.
[1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:45.760]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:30:45.760 --> 1:30:48.760]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[1:30:48.760 --> 1:30:55.760]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:30:55.760 --> 1:31:00.760]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[1:31:00.760 --> 1:31:06.760]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[1:31:06.760 --> 1:31:10.760]  Though you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick,
[1:31:10.760 --> 1:31:14.760]  go to the doctor and buy their drugs, you don't have to cooperate.
[1:31:14.760 --> 1:31:15.760]  There is a solution.
[1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:18.760]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love,
[1:31:18.760 --> 1:31:24.760]  have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[1:31:24.760 --> 1:31:30.760]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need

[1:32:58.760 --> 1:33:25.760]  We better recognize that there is a unified, global corporate government telling people in Australia, in England, in the United States, in Canada, and Europe-wide,
[1:33:25.760 --> 1:33:28.760]  you don't have neighbor kids over.
[1:33:28.760 --> 1:33:32.760]  In England, they're saying you've got to have a license to even talk to kids.
[1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:45.760]  They're making everybody learn that they're a terrorist, that they're bad, that they're not allowed to talk to their neighbors.
[1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:49.760]  And they're coming into every facet of life.
[1:33:49.760 --> 1:34:01.760]  They're actually in major cities like Tulsa, Oklahoma, with the headline, Licenses Proposed for Gardens, with the city councilman saying they may grow marijuana.
[1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:03.760]  So you're guilty until proven innocent.
[1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:06.760]  It's bad in your backyard.
[1:34:06.760 --> 1:34:08.760]  And see, because the council doesn't control that.
[1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:09.760]  And they're God.
[1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:10.760]  They run your life.
[1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:11.760]  You are their slave.
[1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:16.760]  In and enough, you pay all the taxes and pay the cops when they pull you over and pay all the regulations.
[1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:21.760]  And kiss their butt and call them authorities and officials.
[1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:24.760]  You're going to have your entire life run by them.
[1:34:24.760 --> 1:34:29.760]  And there's the city councilman in the paper going, yeah, everybody's getting into gardens.
[1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:31.760]  And we don't know what's being grown.
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:38.760]  And we need to have the police inspect your gardens to license them because there might be marijuana.
[1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:43.760]  And I've done a lot of stories, covered a lot of stories here in Austin of, in one case, an old lady.
[1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:46.760]  No criminal record.
[1:34:46.760 --> 1:34:49.760]  Lived in her little house.
[1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:52.760]  Out in Travis County by Spicewood.
[1:34:52.760 --> 1:34:58.760]  Right by Poodie's bar when a William Elson's stagehand's bars.
[1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:02.760]  And they swat teamed her.
[1:35:02.760 --> 1:35:05.760]  She had blood weed growing in the forest down the hill from her.
[1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:07.760]  Everybody knows blood weed grows everywhere.
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:09.760]  It doesn't even look anything like marijuana.
[1:35:09.760 --> 1:35:26.760]  They came in, laughed about the blood weed, kicked her dog, tore everything apart, went in a rent house she had on the property, pulled out a guy's Playboy magazine and made fun of it in front of him.
[1:35:26.760 --> 1:35:30.760]  Now, that's how America operates.
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:34.760]  Meanwhile, the government ships in the majority of the narcotics to carry all of this out.
[1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:39.760]  They want in your life, period.
[1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:47.760]  And that's what this new government policy imposes strict standards on garage sales.
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:59.760]  Americans who slap $1 price tags on their used possessions at garage sales or bizarre events risk a $15 million fine thanks to new government campaign.
[1:35:59.760 --> 1:36:00.760]  That's Fox News.
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:02.760]  I have a McClatchy newspapers here.
[1:36:02.760 --> 1:36:06.760]  Sell or beware, feds cracking down on garage sales.
[1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:17.760]  And when I printed both of these articles, they had ads to become a police officer on the sides of each one.
[1:36:17.760 --> 1:36:24.760]  Not just because that's what the cookies showed that it was a cop article, an article about police, but that that's just the major ads now.
[1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:31.760]  That's, look, about once a year, I'll go to Toys R Us to buy a bike or something for my kids.
[1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:42.760]  And every time I walk in, there's a big board hanging on the wall of files of the recalls, thousands of them per year.
[1:36:42.760 --> 1:36:47.760]  They say for 10 years, you've got to go check on an online registry of all the recall toys.
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:49.760]  That's just toys.
[1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:53.760]  Everything else get as high as 10% of things get recalled.
[1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:54.760]  No one knows all this.
[1:36:54.760 --> 1:36:56.760]  No one knows where they got a table.
[1:36:56.760 --> 1:36:58.760]  No one knows where this mouse came from.
[1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:02.760]  If it gets recalled, I don't have time to sit there and read hundreds of documents.
[1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:05.760]  If it's, there's a 10% chance this has been recalled.
[1:37:05.760 --> 1:37:07.760]  It's got some lead part in it.
[1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:11.760]  Hell, more than half the milk products for kids that got melamine in it.
[1:37:11.760 --> 1:37:18.760]  Instead of recalling it, though, they just say, oh, melamine's good for you now.
[1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:26.760]  Many different inks that you print with get recalled now with all sorts of poison in it from China and the U.S.
[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:29.760]  Upwards of 10% of products are recalled.
[1:37:29.760 --> 1:37:33.760]  One time my wife got freaked out about it about two, three years ago, and that was really big news.
[1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:41.760]  And she found out the little color, little blue table we got with a red, yellow, and green chair for kids from Target was recalled.
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:43.760]  And she freaked out and took it back.
[1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:46.760]  And then she found out this was, she's like, my God, this is recalled.
[1:37:46.760 --> 1:37:47.760]  This is recalled.
[1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:48.760]  This is recalled.
[1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:55.760]  And pretty soon I said, yeah, just anything made in China, you can forget it.
[1:37:55.760 --> 1:38:04.760]  See, because they got to store that toxic waste from all their chemical plants and all their microchip plants.
[1:38:04.760 --> 1:38:09.760]  Just like they had fluoride in the 40s at World War II, they said, hell, dump it in the water.
[1:38:09.760 --> 1:38:20.760]  Because they'd been doing that in Tennessee at the Nuke plants, the byproduct of making the uranium rods, and the plutonium rods, mainly uranium rods, they'd been dumping it in the water.
[1:38:20.760 --> 1:38:24.760]  And they said, hell, the public didn't notice, so they'd dump it in the water.
[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:30.760]  China, dumps it in your cereal, dumps it in your baby formula, dumps it in your drugs, dumps it in the paint.
[1:38:30.760 --> 1:38:36.760]  They paint's a great place to mix poison up because it congeals and freezes.
[1:38:36.760 --> 1:38:43.760]  So you now are supposed to know tens of thousands of products that have been recalled.
[1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:52.760]  And you're supposed to then not, and they say they're already under the federal stimulus money paying for local cops to be federalized.
[1:38:52.760 --> 1:38:54.760]  And it's already being reported.
[1:38:54.760 --> 1:38:58.760]  They're coming up and writing people $100,000 tickets.
[1:38:58.760 --> 1:39:02.760]  And they come in with a computer laptop without a warrant.
[1:39:02.760 --> 1:39:04.760]  That's, search everything you've got.
[1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:09.760]  You sit there going, I was just trying to clean out the garage.
[1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:10.760]  Shut up.
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:12.760]  Shut up, Al-Qaeda.
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:14.760]  And you think I'm joking.
[1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:20.760]  I get reports every day or two of them SWAT teaming Amish, SWAT teaming farmers and ranchers.
[1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:27.760]  They don't just come and find you in all these states now saying you can't sell eggs or watermelons or squash or whatever without a permit.
[1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:31.760]  They now send SWAT teams.
[1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:34.760]  We've had the farmers on the show.
[1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:36.760]  They, look, they're rogue.
[1:39:36.760 --> 1:39:39.760]  They're criminal.
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:47.760]  I mean, I think about how it's in the news every week, how different Texas towns just pull over old ladies,
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:51.760]  pull over people and rob the hell out of them and people get on the news and make excuses.
[1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:53.760]  They go, yeah, we take your money.
[1:39:53.760 --> 1:39:56.760]  By the way, me and my family and cousins run the town.
[1:39:56.760 --> 1:40:00.760]  There's nothing that he ain't gonna do.
[1:40:00.760 --> 1:40:02.760]  And it's just like Hardin.
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:09.760]  The entire town hates the private con artists with 14 felonies coming in and taking over the prison and policing people.
[1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:16.760]  But every one of the locals that's in power just sits there and goes, how about you get the hell out of here?
[1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:18.760]  We're gonna keep running thing.
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:22.760]  Damn right, we're gonna throw the local slobs in there and make a little money.
[1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:29.760]  Oh, we're not gonna let you.
[1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:36.760]  Oh, you think you're gonna have two or three of the neighbor kids when it's sleeting outside of Michigan 20 below?
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:38.760]  As it is on average about a month out of the year.
[1:40:38.760 --> 1:40:42.760]  You think you're gonna have kids come in and stand under your porch?
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:44.760]  They're not gonna stand in your garage.
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:48.760]  And the lady's like, well, can I have them stand in the garage?
[1:40:48.760 --> 1:40:50.760]  No slave.
[1:40:50.760 --> 1:40:52.760]  You get one hour out in the yard a day.
[1:40:52.760 --> 1:40:54.760]  You pay me everything you produce.
[1:40:54.760 --> 1:40:56.760]  It's all pimp game.
[1:40:56.760 --> 1:40:59.760]  It's like, my bitches pay me 110% back.
[1:40:59.760 --> 1:41:01.760]  And they're like, I just love you, baby.
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:04.760]  They were telling me a story about some HBO special about pimps.
[1:41:04.760 --> 1:41:08.760]  What was the name of the movie?
[1:41:08.760 --> 1:41:10.760]  Pimp Pimps Up, Hose Down.
[1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:14.760]  And Hartman, go ahead and come on the mic and describe it.
[1:41:14.760 --> 1:41:18.760]  I mean, Hartman tells the story good, but this lady's been in a car wreck or shot and she's just telling the pimp.
[1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:20.760]  I'm sorry, baby, I'm gonna get you the money.
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:23.760]  I'm gonna get you everything you need, homeland security.
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:25.760]  And that's how it is with this government.
[1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:27.760]  It's just like, you're gonna give us more.
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:28.760]  We're far in bank run.
[1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:30.760]  We're gonna, I'm going to your calls in a moment.
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:32.760]  We're gonna take everything you got and you're gonna beg us.
[1:41:32.760 --> 1:41:33.760]  Go ahead.
[1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:38.760]  Oh, yeah, just talking about the pimps up, hose down.
[1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:42.760]  You, yeah, there's a portion of there where I believe it's pimping again.
[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:45.760]  He's a notorious infamous pimp from way back in the day.
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:47.760]  Rappers rap about him all the time.
[1:41:47.760 --> 1:41:53.760]  And he had one of his workers that got beat up and shot stab the whole nine.
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:58.760]  He gets to the hospital and the young lady is laying in the hospital bed just saying,
[1:41:58.760 --> 1:42:00.760]  Oh, baby, I'm gonna get back on the streets.
[1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:02.760]  I'm gonna get that money for you, baby.
[1:42:02.760 --> 1:42:03.760]  Don't worry about me.
[1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:04.760]  I'm all right.
[1:42:04.760 --> 1:42:06.760]  I just want to get about this bed and make this money for you.
[1:42:06.760 --> 1:42:10.760]  And the mom is sitting right there and looking at pimping can is like,
[1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:12.760]  What have you done to my baby?
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:17.760]  And just later on, he talks about the percentage of the cut.
[1:42:17.760 --> 1:42:22.760]  He's like, how much do you give your, your employees 10%, 5% like hell.
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:24.760]  No, I don't give him nothing.
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:25.760]  That's my money.
[1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:27.760]  I'll give him some chicken.
[1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:29.760]  I'll give him a bucket of chicken.
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:38.760]  And, uh, but now that's, that's all about the game right there, you know, just, I guess, psychologically raping you.
[1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:41.760]  And, and, and I found that with women.
[1:42:41.760 --> 1:42:44.760]  I didn't know why in high school, I wasn't mean to women, but I didn't care.
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:52.760]  Cause I, you know, I was, I was just out of my mind on testosterone and, you know, growing up.
[1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:56.760]  And that's why the bad guys always get the girls.
[1:42:56.760 --> 1:43:00.760]  But society, now that men have been feminized, that's how this works.
[1:43:00.760 --> 1:43:04.760]  When they, when, when those locals running that town go, we're going to have a felon run things.
[1:43:04.760 --> 1:43:05.760]  Hell yeah.
[1:43:05.760 --> 1:43:06.760]  No problem with it.
[1:43:06.760 --> 1:43:09.760]  That is just exercising power over us.
[1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:11.760]  And that's what government's doing.
[1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:13.760]  It's consciously breaking our back.
[1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:19.760]  And I watch these people, I watch the troops as they die of the vaccines, as they get ripped off, as they got to pay for their own health care.
[1:43:19.760 --> 1:43:21.760]  They're just like, I just appreciate the government.
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:22.760]  I just worship the government.
[1:43:22.760 --> 1:43:29.760]  And it's a broken back, capitulated, totally, totally broken, broken.
[1:43:29.760 --> 1:43:34.760]  It's a broken society who just, who want to be lied to.
[1:43:34.760 --> 1:43:35.760]  They want to feed their kids melamine.
[1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:36.760]  They want to take shots.
[1:43:36.760 --> 1:43:38.760]  They want their kids to be retarded.
[1:43:38.760 --> 1:43:39.760]  They want to be lied to.
[1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:41.760]  They, they want to be scammed and gained.
[1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:46.760]  And they, and they loved to worship the military and worship cops and worship all of this.
[1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:47.760]  It's just sick.
[1:43:47.760 --> 1:43:55.760]  Yeah, it's almost as like people get the Okie-Doke pulled on them so many times that they're dizzy.
[1:43:55.760 --> 1:43:57.760]  They're just dizzy from the Okie-Dokes.
[1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:00.760]  And now they'll just, they'll take whatever is given to them.
[1:44:00.760 --> 1:44:01.760]  They'll just go along.
[1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:02.760]  It's the herd mentality.
[1:44:02.760 --> 1:44:04.760]  And translate Okie-Doke, the scam.
[1:44:04.760 --> 1:44:05.760]  Yeah.
[1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:06.760]  Yeah.
[1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:07.760]  It's the Dipsy-Doo-Dungaroo.
[1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:08.760]  You know what I mean?
[1:44:08.760 --> 1:44:10.760]  The total flipped of the script.
[1:44:10.760 --> 1:44:12.760]  And they're cranking.
[1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:13.760]  Yeah.

[1:44:22.760 --> 1:44:27.760]  And I saw this in Hardin and get like a little demon looking their eyes and like, it's mine.
[1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:28.760]  I like being conned.
[1:44:28.760 --> 1:44:31.760]  And I don't understand.
[1:44:31.760 --> 1:44:32.760]  It's like, hey, you're being conned.
[1:44:32.760 --> 1:44:33.760]  And I like it.
[1:44:33.760 --> 1:44:35.760]  I like it because it's like yuppies.

[1:44:38.760 --> 1:44:39.760]  It's taking over.
[1:44:39.760 --> 1:44:40.760]  It's a scam.
[1:44:40.760 --> 1:44:41.760]  We pay to be their slave.
[1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:44.760]  Or, hey, 23.7 trillion.
[1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:46.760]  We pay interest on the money we give the banks.
[1:44:46.760 --> 1:44:49.760]  And yuppies will like giggle and go, I got a Mercedes.
[1:44:49.760 --> 1:44:52.760]  You know, it's like, it's like, who, who, I like it.
[1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:55.760]  And it's like, don't you, man, I'm telling you, we're in trouble.
[1:44:55.760 --> 1:44:58.760]  Man, it's almost as if I've said this before you.
[1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:02.760]  But you know, when you work out and you get sore, or if you play a, when you're a kid,
[1:45:02.760 --> 1:45:06.760]  you play football or whatever sport and you're sore, you're beaten up afterwards.
[1:45:06.760 --> 1:45:12.760]  And for whatever reason that next day it hurts, but it feels good.
[1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:14.760]  And it's like, that's what's going on.
[1:45:14.760 --> 1:45:18.760]  People just getting beat up and, you know, having to play the game.
[1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:20.760]  And they don't even understand it.
[1:45:20.760 --> 1:45:23.760]  They're beaten down and sore and for whatever.
[1:45:23.760 --> 1:45:24.760]  Exactly.
[1:45:24.760 --> 1:45:26.760]  But I mean, they revel in being scammed.
[1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:29.760]  They, they, they love it.
[1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:30.760]  All right.
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:31.760]  Good job, Hartman.
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:32.760]  I appreciate you coming in.
[1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:36.760]  No, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, this is the pimp game.
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:43.760]  And now again, locals that were awake, they were upset about what had happened.
[1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:45.760]  They understood the scam.
[1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:46.760]  Their, their eyes were alive.
[1:45:46.760 --> 1:45:49.760]  They had very sad concern.
[1:45:49.760 --> 1:45:51.760]  But then you had all the fat cats.
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:56.760]  And I mean, folks, a fat cat was somebody that owned, you know, a dry cleaners or somebody
[1:45:56.760 --> 1:46:01.760]  that owned a tiny restaurant and they would just strut around and tell you,
[1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:06.760]  I'm pretty important in this town and I like American police force.
[1:46:06.760 --> 1:46:07.760]  And I go, you don't care.
[1:46:07.760 --> 1:46:08.760]  He's a felon.
[1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:09.760]  They go, no, I like it.
[1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:13.760]  And I would just be going, they'd like, now, why don't you get the hell out of here?
[1:46:13.760 --> 1:46:14.760]  Farner.
[1:46:14.760 --> 1:46:18.760]  And I'm like, but he's the farner running a scam on you.
[1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:21.760]  You want him running around, locking up locals in the private jail.
[1:46:21.760 --> 1:46:23.760]  They're like, yeah, I do.
[1:46:23.760 --> 1:46:25.760]  And I walked into the sheriff's department.
[1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:26.760]  I like to meet with the sheriff.
[1:46:26.760 --> 1:46:27.760]  He's not here.
[1:46:27.760 --> 1:46:28.760]  Deputy sheriff.
[1:46:28.760 --> 1:46:29.760]  Maybe later.
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:34.760]  And then, and then, and the woman was so cowardly behind the big horn sheriff's department thing.
[1:46:34.760 --> 1:46:38.760]  When I was looking her in the eyes, she was acting nice, but like a dog.
[1:46:38.760 --> 1:46:41.760]  As soon as we turned to walk out, she pulled up and came in the doorway.
[1:46:41.760 --> 1:46:42.760]  It was like primitive.
[1:46:42.760 --> 1:46:48.760]  Like, like, like, like she was chicken with her, you know, running us off and she got
[1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:52.760]  out in the doorway and said, by the way, we don't like people from out of town.
[1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:53.760]  Tell us what to do.
[1:46:53.760 --> 1:46:55.760]  And this town was good before you came in.
[1:46:55.760 --> 1:46:58.760]  And we like American police force.
[1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:00.760]  And we like what they're doing.
[1:47:00.760 --> 1:47:01.760]  And I'm like, oh, really?
[1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:07.760]  You like the felon going to take over and even the sheriff likes it.
[1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:11.760]  Now just get on out of here.
[1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:17.760]  Because she see to her, it doesn't matter if she's being scammed as long as she doesn't
[1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:18.760]  think she's being scammed.
[1:47:18.760 --> 1:47:20.760]  See, I'm the bad one.
[1:47:20.760 --> 1:47:23.760]  I'm telling you the federal reserve is private and totally raping us.
[1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:28.760]  I'm telling you they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and writing giant text books
[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:31.760]  about how they're doing it like eco science by the wide out science are.
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:36.760]  I mean, these bastards admit they're poisoning us and I got stacks of news of the shots jacking
[1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:39.760]  everybody up.
[1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:41.760]  But now I'm going to understand psychology more.
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:46.760]  I'm if you try to walk up to some crack or with wearing a wig as her hair is falling out
[1:47:46.760 --> 1:47:51.760]  and she's only got one, two, she's going, uh, that's why those crack horse get like that
[1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:54.760]  because the pimps give them nothing, but maybe a little bit of chicken and a little bit of
[1:47:54.760 --> 1:47:55.760]  crack, just enough.
[1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:57.760]  And they're like zombies, folks.
[1:47:57.760 --> 1:47:58.760]  They're under a spell.
[1:47:58.760 --> 1:48:05.760]  And if you try to walk up to them and say, let me get you to rehab, let me get you off
[1:48:05.760 --> 1:48:06.760]  this.
[1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:07.760]  The Pimp is abusing you.
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:11.760]  You don't talk bad about Leroy mother calling it.
[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:13.760]  I'll jack you up.
[1:48:13.760 --> 1:48:19.760]  I mean, literally, literally, I grew up in Dallas folks.
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:22.760]  I've seen plenty of crack horse and that's how it is.
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:25.760]  I've talked to pastors that have tried to get them off the street and help them.
[1:48:25.760 --> 1:48:27.760]  That's exactly what the, and it's the general public.
[1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:29.760]  They're just like, I love being scammed.
[1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:30.760]  I love being lied to.
[1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:32.760]  I love being defrauded.
[1:48:32.760 --> 1:48:33.760]  I love it.
[1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:34.760]  I love it.
[1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:35.760]  I love it.
[1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:37.760]  I love it.
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:43.760]  And so the new order just says, how do we make all these people prisoners?
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:44.760]  How do we suck everything?
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:46.760]  How do we make them slaves again?
[1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:49.760]  Say it's to save the earth tax air.
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:50.760]  Yeah.
[1:48:50.760 --> 1:48:51.760]  They'll love it.
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:52.760]  Oh, it's such a big scam.
[1:48:52.760 --> 1:48:53.760]  They're going to love it.
[1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:58.760]  And then they come out and do it and lie to you and know they're lying.
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:02.760]  And we'll tell them they can't have neighbor kids over at the bus stop.
[1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:06.760]  We'll tell them they can't sell watermelons on the street corner and watch the little slaves.
[1:49:06.760 --> 1:49:07.760]  They'll do it.
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:14.760]  And all the dramas and sitcoms and TV shows worship cops and worship military, the police
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:15.760]  have been militarized.
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:17.760]  They've been trained to kill people and break things.
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:20.760]  The military is designed to kill people and break things.
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:25.760]  Uh, this is not the, our military that fought in 1776 or in Mexico attack.
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:29.760]  This went down to Mexico and kicked their butt and then came back.
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:35.760]  This is an imperial military now working for people that want to bring this country down.
[1:49:35.760 --> 1:49:40.760]  And they are training the military to occupy the U S and now admitting it and training
[1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:41.760]  them.
[1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:43.760]  Their number one enemy is conservatives and gun owners.
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:51.760]  The little boys are going, I guess I'll turn my guns in cause I love portray us.
[1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:55.760]  And I'm like, but the flag symbolizes the bill of rights are like, shut up.
[1:49:55.760 --> 1:50:01.760]  If they say it's conservative and America, you see the American flag right there.
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:03.760]  That means police state.
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:06.760]  That means no rights at all.
[1:50:06.760 --> 1:50:12.760]  Why don't you just leave America if you don't like the army deploying on the streets.
[1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:16.760]  Some kind of liberal coming.
[1:50:16.760 --> 1:50:18.760]  Oh, look at that.
[1:50:18.760 --> 1:50:23.760]  Yeah, all the major phone companies, all the major cable guys, all the major groups are
[1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:27.760]  openly announcing their spying on you.
[1:50:27.760 --> 1:50:29.760]  And they openly train the plumber groups.
[1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:33.760]  Everybody when they're in your house without a warrant, they're spying on you.
[1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:34.760]  And I told the story.
[1:50:34.760 --> 1:50:35.760]  I'm going to take calls and get to it later.
[1:50:35.760 --> 1:50:39.760]  I'm going to tell him to tell I'm about to go home Saturday morning.
[1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:41.760]  I'm going up the elevator.
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:43.760]  It opens on the third floor on the wrong floor.
[1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:46.760]  And there's girl scouts with police and homeland security.
[1:50:46.760 --> 1:50:48.760]  And I wasn't expecting it.
[1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:52.760]  So I stepped out, looked at it for about 10 seconds and then actually started
[1:50:52.760 --> 1:50:55.760]  panicking, hitting the button because it was too hard.
[1:50:55.760 --> 1:50:56.760]  It was like body snatcher.
[1:50:56.760 --> 1:50:57.760]  I was like, give me the hell out of here.
[1:50:57.760 --> 1:50:58.760]  What the hell?
[1:50:58.760 --> 1:50:59.760]  I'm in the Soviet Union.
[1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:05.760]  I mean, you know, before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.

[1:55:04.760 --> 1:55:07.760]  the police-state tattletale spy takeover.
[1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:10.760]  We expose the warmongering of both parties.
[1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:13.760]  You want to understand who the globalist are and what their operation is.
[1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:19.760]  This is the film, Alan Watson, and so many others.
[1:55:19.760 --> 1:55:21.760]  John Perkins, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[1:55:21.760 --> 1:55:23.760]  The list just goes on and on.
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:31.760]  FalloftheRepublicinfowars.com, 888-2533139, 888-2533139.
[1:55:31.760 --> 1:55:36.760]  You'll also be able to see it coming up October 21st in super high quality at prismplanet.tv,
[1:55:36.760 --> 1:55:38.760]  for all the great members of that.
[1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:43.760]  Okay, Josh Smith was with us at the G20, saw all the hellish stuff that happened up there,
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:49.760]  with the LRADS being used on citizens, no protest allowed in the city, just like Communist China.
[1:55:49.760 --> 1:55:52.760]  Not allowed to have neighbor kids over, not allowed to have a farmer's market.
[1:55:52.760 --> 1:55:54.760]  It's the new America.
[1:55:54.760 --> 1:55:58.760]  Cindy Sheehan was just arrested at the winehouse for protesting the Afghan war,
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:00.760]  not allowed to protest without a permit.
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:02.760]  They don't issue permits.
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:07.760]  Josh Smith is associate of Cindy Sheehan, and we met him at the G20 in Pittsburgh.
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:10.760]  And they are the true anti-war people.
[1:56:10.760 --> 1:56:16.760]  As Obama expands the war, the military gripes at him for not enough troops to give him left cover,
[1:56:16.760 --> 1:56:18.760]  to give him a false choice.
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:21.760]  Josh, tell us what just happened there in D.C.
[1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:26.760]  We came to the White House, Alex, with three to four hundred people.
[1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:32.760]  We were just protesting directly across Lafayette Park at the fence of the White House.
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:38.760]  We had four main groups with us, which were Veterans for Peace, World Care Wait,
[1:56:38.760 --> 1:56:40.760]  and the March of Death group.
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:43.760]  They do a kind of a performance act.
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:44.760]  With the coffins.
[1:56:44.760 --> 1:56:48.760]  Yes, coffins, and they all lay down in the white maps.
[1:56:48.760 --> 1:56:53.760]  And Cindy changed herself to D.K. to the fence.
[1:56:53.760 --> 1:57:00.760]  And they went after her first, and they took everybody off the sidewalk with the big horses,
[1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:04.760]  and threatened to, you know, basically run you over.
[1:57:04.760 --> 1:57:08.760]  Yes, see, in China, they would stop with the tanks.
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:10.760]  Not at G20, not here.
[1:57:10.760 --> 1:57:12.760]  They'll go ahead and run you over.
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:13.760]  They'll go ahead and attack you.
[1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:17.760]  They'll come up to women, full power, the Billy Club, and I've watched police over and over again,
[1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:19.760]  just with every bit of power.
[1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:21.760]  Yeah, you're just like really trying to kill you.
[1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:23.760]  And that's like, yeah, I love the police.
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:24.760]  I love the military.
[1:57:24.760 --> 1:57:25.760]  They work for the foreign banks.
[1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:26.760]  Rape us.
[1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:27.760]  We love it.
[1:57:27.760 --> 1:57:28.760]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:34.760]  Yes, Alex, and we were initially told and warned many times to get off the sidewalk.
[1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:36.760]  We were pushed into the streets.
[1:57:36.760 --> 1:57:39.760]  Then we were pushed off the streets back into Lafayette Park.
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:45.760]  Then we had our lawyers in the National Lawyer Guild come out and contest everything that
[1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:47.760]  they were trying to do against this.
[1:57:47.760 --> 1:57:52.760]  They backed off for a while, but then they rolled in buses, about three buses, and they're
[1:57:52.760 --> 1:57:54.760]  still putting people in there now.
[1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:57.760]  I just saw David Swanson, the writer, author.
[1:57:57.760 --> 1:58:00.760]  He was just arrested and put in a bus.
[1:58:00.760 --> 1:58:02.760]  They're arresting women.
[1:58:02.760 --> 1:58:05.760]  There's many priests that are in handcuffs right now.
[1:58:05.760 --> 1:58:08.760]  And they said at the G-22, no protest allowed.
[1:58:08.760 --> 1:58:09.760]  We have the police chief on video.
[1:58:09.760 --> 1:58:11.760]  This is the new America.
[1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:13.760]  They told us we did not have a permit.
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:19.760]  We pulled out a pocket copy of the Constitution, and we told them here's our permit right here.
[1:58:19.760 --> 1:58:20.760]  I talked to a guy yesterday.
[1:58:20.760 --> 1:58:25.760]  The police came in his house without a warrant, and he said, hey, I have a Constitution.
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:28.760]  And the guy said, what are you, one of them pruthers?
[1:58:28.760 --> 1:58:31.760]  So, I mean, they just flip out.
[1:58:31.760 --> 1:58:34.760]  Stay there for one minute, so we're going to come back and get some more news from you.
[1:58:34.760 --> 1:58:39.760]  Then I promise we're going to go to your calls and take a lot of them at 1-800-259-9231.
[1:58:39.760 --> 1:58:43.760]  We just reached the halfway point in transmission.
[1:58:43.760 --> 1:58:46.760]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:46.760 --> 1:58:51.760]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.760 --> 1:58:52.760]  Hello, friends.
[1:58:52.760 --> 1:58:55.760]  I'm Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:58:55.760 --> 1:58:57.760]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[1:58:57.760 --> 1:59:05.760]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:59:05.760 --> 1:59:11.760]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[1:59:11.760 --> 1:59:13.760]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[1:59:13.760 --> 1:59:19.760]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[1:59:19.760 --> 1:59:26.760]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration,
[1:59:26.760 --> 1:59:30.760]  reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[1:59:30.760 --> 1:59:34.760]  That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe.
[1:59:34.760 --> 1:59:38.760]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[1:59:38.760 --> 1:59:48.760]  That's 1-800-691-6043, or visit Acola Blue on the web at www.ecoloblu.com today.
[1:59:48.760 --> 1:59:50.760]  That's acolablu.com.
[2:00:18.760 --> 2:00:30.760]  Now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:30.760 --> 2:00:38.760]  All right. Cindy Sheehan dared not allowed to protest in D.C., not allowed to protest at G20.
[2:00:38.760 --> 2:00:41.760]  I've been in D.C. several times the last few years.
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:44.760]  You can be 200 yards away from the Washington Monument.
[2:00:44.760 --> 2:00:47.760]  They walk over and say, no videotaping.
[2:00:47.760 --> 2:00:50.760]  Of course, if you call the city, they then say, well, there's no permit to tape.
[2:00:50.760 --> 2:00:54.760]  They don't care. They've been told to let you know you are lower than dirt.
[2:00:54.760 --> 2:01:01.760]  You will be harassed more in D.C. than you will be in Beijing outside the forbidden city.
[2:01:01.760 --> 2:01:08.760]  This is not land of the free home of the brave, folks, and they're letting you know you're here to pay money to offshore banks
[2:01:08.760 --> 2:01:12.760]  and to give your kids over to CPS and to supply kids for the military.
[2:01:12.760 --> 2:01:14.760]  That's it.
[2:01:14.760 --> 2:01:18.760]  You think you're allowed to have free association? You think you're allowed to protest?
[2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:22.760]  Well, we're allowed to fracture your skull with a billy club.
[2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:28.760]  Josh Smith, finishing up with the police state you're witnessing as they're arresting peaceful protesters at Lafayette Park
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:31.760]  across the street from the puppet house.
[2:01:31.760 --> 2:01:35.760]  Yes, very much, Alex. Cindy Sheehan is arrested.
[2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:41.760]  I want to make it very clear that here in D.C. today and at the G20 in Pittsburgh,
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:49.760]  the only people instigating any conflict or any violence are the police.
[2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:51.760]  Well, they've got a severe hatred of this country.
[2:01:51.760 --> 2:01:58.760]  I mean, that's what I've noticed is they revel in what they do. They enjoy it.
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:03.760]  They are itching to attack you. They're itching to arrest you.
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:10.760]  They are fascists. They are Hitler's wet dream, Alex.
[2:02:10.760 --> 2:02:16.760]  I know, and that doesn't mean all police, but whoever they're selecting for these riot teams or for these police squads,
[2:02:16.760 --> 2:02:21.760]  these protest squads, whoever they're, or maybe it's the mass psychology, I don't know.
[2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:24.760]  But Rob Do has been officially charged, by the way.
[2:02:24.760 --> 2:02:32.760]  They charged him. Yeah, they charged him for the 24th, not the 25th, the Friday that he was at.
[2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:37.760]  They blocked him off at a park, wouldn't let him leave and then arrested him.
[2:02:37.760 --> 2:02:42.760]  It's all on video. He wasn't even at the university, the 24th.
[2:02:42.760 --> 2:02:47.760]  They have charged him with that wrong day, wrong place, and they don't care.
[2:02:47.760 --> 2:02:52.760]  They say, we're going to court with it. And it doesn't matter if we got the wrong day down.
[2:02:52.760 --> 2:02:57.760]  We don't care. I mean, they're just, well, I don't know what to say.
[2:02:57.760 --> 2:03:02.760]  So I was down at the event Friday night where Rob was, I met up with Jason.
[2:03:02.760 --> 2:03:08.760]  I witnessed, I witnessed the all sorts of the forces, police forces, military forces.
[2:03:08.760 --> 2:03:15.760]  I witnessed them attacking peaceful, innocent bystanders who were just watching what was going on.
[2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:21.760]  Yeah, they came on to the university and the news reported went into dorms looking for people.
[2:03:21.760 --> 2:03:24.760]  Yes. Because see, the cops discovered they would go down empty streets,
[2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:27.760]  L ratting little kids in their front yard. We have photos and videos.
[2:03:27.760 --> 2:03:32.760]  So they would think, where can we find people in Pittsburgh out at night, the university?
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:38.760]  And they just, they were chasing people back into the neighborhood and back across the dorms.
[2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:42.760]  And as they came across the dorms, they were still firing tear gas.
[2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:47.760]  I stood directly next to two students who were shot with bean background.
[2:03:47.760 --> 2:03:52.760]  It was the most fascist, horrible thing I've ever seen.
[2:03:52.760 --> 2:03:58.760]  Well, I told you, they will put us in pits and put lead into us. Many of these people have ordered.
[2:03:58.760 --> 2:04:00.760]  They want to. To them, it's a macho hunting.
[2:04:00.760 --> 2:04:07.760]  It's, you know, it's, they've taken their regular hunting instincts, their predator instincts and place it onto their fellow humans.
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:11.760]  That's what unjust war is. It's a war of aggression.
[2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:17.760]  It is preemptive war against the people. They know the banks are going to steal everything and they know we're going to resist.
[2:04:17.760 --> 2:04:19.760]  And so they're trying to intimidate us.
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:23.760]  Well, as soon as Cindy gets out, we'd like to have her on this week with us.
[2:04:23.760 --> 2:04:27.760]  Fire out the website for folks that want to try to give Cindy some support.
[2:04:27.760 --> 2:04:31.760]  Cindy Sheehan, soapbox.com. It's her website.
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:39.760]  Also, Alex, I'd like to say that Cindy has just announced the International People's Declaration of Deed, which she just read in front of the White House.
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:41.760]  And got arrested for.
[2:04:41.760 --> 2:04:43.760]  Correct.
[2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:45.760]  And again, don't have the neighbor kids over with your kids.
[2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:49.760]  You're not allowed to without a government license and don't have a garage sale or you'll get arrested.
[2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:51.760]  Don't sell eggs on the street corner. You get arrested.
[2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:57.760]  And if you're a foreign illegal mercenary 14 time felon, you're good.
[2:04:57.760 --> 2:05:01.760]  It's the criminals world will be right back with your calls.
[2:05:01.760 --> 2:05:04.760]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:05:04.760 --> 2:05:08.760]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[2:05:08.760 --> 2:05:12.760]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[2:05:12.760 --> 2:05:17.760]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:05:17.760 --> 2:05:23.760]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity for free.
[2:05:23.760 --> 2:05:26.760]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:05:26.760 --> 2:05:31.760]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:05:31.760 --> 2:05:38.760]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:05:38.760 --> 2:05:40.760]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[2:05:40.760 --> 2:05:48.760]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.

[2:06:33.760 --> 2:06:37.760]  You know the government isn't looking out for you. You need to look out for yourself.
[2:06:37.760 --> 2:06:40.760]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[2:06:40.760 --> 2:06:44.760]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[2:06:44.760 --> 2:06:48.760]  Go to HereIsWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[2:06:48.760 --> 2:06:51.760]  Again, it is HereIsWhatYouDo.net.
[2:06:51.760 --> 2:06:56.760]  That's HereIsWhatYouDo.net. One last time, it's HereIsWhatYouDo.net.
[2:07:21.760 --> 2:07:27.760]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[2:07:27.760 --> 2:07:32.760]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the Gathering Center and be immunized?
[2:07:32.760 --> 2:07:36.760]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:07:36.760 --> 2:07:42.760]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[2:07:42.760 --> 2:07:45.760]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:52.760]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[2:07:52.760 --> 2:08:00.760]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[2:08:03.760 --> 2:08:09.760]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[2:08:09.760 --> 2:08:13.760]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:13.760 --> 2:08:22.760]  Okay, here's the deal. I want to talk about the police state takeover. I want to talk more about Hardin, Montana.
[2:08:22.760 --> 2:08:28.760]  I want to get into the new stimulus plan. Incredible news on the flu front. I'm going to cover that first.
[2:08:28.760 --> 2:08:33.760]  But after, I take a bunch of calls. Now, these calls are going to be great. They're always great.
[2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:39.760]  Summer does, but most of them are really good. So when we take calls, there's always a lot of great ones in there to be technical.
[2:08:39.760 --> 2:08:45.760]  That's what I meant to say. But just have your point, your question ready so I can get to the next person.
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:50.760]  I know you've been holding a while. As you hear a caller hang up, that's your chance to get involved on air.
[2:08:50.760 --> 2:08:57.760]  We'd love to hear from you. 1-800-259-9231. Let's talk to Gary and Mass. Gary, thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:09:04.760]  Thanks, Alex. I really appreciate it. I wanted to chat with you about the flu and codex elementarius if you have a minute for that.
[2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:14.760]  Sure. A couple things. If you go to flu.gov, the government talks about the seasonal flu vaccine being separate from H1N1 flu vaccines.
[2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:24.760]  And yet, we're finding that at public schools across America this week, principals are being recommended to tell all the parents to send their kids in and sign that form.
[2:09:24.760 --> 2:09:34.760]  And don't worry, there's no H1N1 in the normal flu shot. And yet, when I go to FDA.gov and I look at every single flu manufacturer's product for normal flu shots,
[2:09:34.760 --> 2:09:46.760]  flu mis, flu zone, flu, varix, flu variant, they're all containing not only the squailing that we've been talking about, they all contain H1N1, H3N2, and something else.
[2:09:46.760 --> 2:09:56.760]  Yeah, I think Paul Watson and Curt Nemos have done reports on this. If they have it, they need to. But yes, that is confirmed. That's why Horowitz flipped out.
[2:09:56.760 --> 2:10:06.760]  Was he noticed a month ago that they were saying their regular flu shot was going to have H1N1? How did they know this a year ago when this hadn't even come up on the radar?
[2:10:06.760 --> 2:10:16.760]  Then they lie and say, don't worry, it doesn't have it. Then they're also lying saying it's mandatory when you don't have to take the flu shot to go to school.
[2:10:16.760 --> 2:10:22.760]  So, you know, even if you're for vaccination, why are you for you and your kids being lied to?
[2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:37.760]  And yeah, the squalings at at least five times, regular levels, super deadly, adjuvant, all these top scientists and medical doctors we've had on saying that's what's frying out the brain, neurological disorders.
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:48.760]  It just goes on and on. And yeah, I'm going to get into flu later. It's just so amazing to actually see this happening.
[2:10:48.760 --> 2:10:56.760]  And to then hear them lying and saying there's no such thing as adverse reactions, then the CDC says, no, there's going to be a lot of adverse reactions, including deaths.
[2:10:56.760 --> 2:11:07.760]  I mean, it's just, but the public is gullible. I mean, I watched the public at bus stops and at grocery stores, and it's like they're willfully, they just look so stupid.
[2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:19.760]  And it's like self-induced. And I don't under, I mean, I don't have some elitist view of myself, but I have become a sardonic person, not in that I think I'm high and mighty.
[2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:29.760]  See, the elitists see all these dumb people and just want to kill them and then try to dumb them down further. They're trying, you know, trying to make them stupid and dumb and mindless.
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:37.760]  I look at the public and it's like, dear God, they're like monkeys or something. I mean, they just, I'm monkeys less trusting than they are.
[2:11:37.760 --> 2:11:46.760]  At least animals have got a little common sense. And I, they're just so trusting. Anything else, Gary?
[2:11:46.760 --> 2:11:54.760]  Yeah, a couple of quick things. So one other point on flu and then on Codex Alimentarius on the flu miss, which now that, after I had a little dial-up.
[2:11:54.760 --> 2:11:59.760]  That was my next big point. I'm watching Fox today and I already knew this, but see if it's what you're about to say.
[2:11:59.760 --> 2:12:15.760]  I'm watching Fox on the treadmill and they admit what doctors said two months ago here that it's a live H1N1 that's quote been weakened, but they said live in the flu miss.
[2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:25.760]  So they had the doctor on there and that if you have an autoimmune problem, don't take it and then it's for people two to 45 and that that's the only one they have available.
[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:31.760]  And it's like the cabbage patch doll. Everybody wants to have it and that it can actually spread the flu.
[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:39.760]  So just what all the doctors said on the show, they're going to use a live nasal system to give people the flu.
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:46.760]  And then it's going to make a bunch of people sick. They're preconditioning that it won't make you sick. Then they're going to spread it.
[2:12:46.760 --> 2:12:49.760]  I mean, they are engaging in a false flag right in front of us. Go ahead.
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:55.760]  Alex, it feels like we're in a cartoon from like Marvel or DC Comics.
[2:12:55.760 --> 2:12:59.760]  And you know what? We need more people like you as Ironman to stop these folks.
[2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:04.760]  They are definitely spreading H1N1 through the flu miss. It's unbelievable.
[2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:11.760]  One quick thing on Codex, Alimentarius, December 31st this year is when it starts to take effect.
[2:13:11.760 --> 2:13:16.760]  Now, if you want to defend yourself against the flu, we've heard from these folks that, you know, fish oil is good.
[2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:20.760]  Vitamin D is good. Vitamin C is good. I've heard that in some studies people have lived longer.
[2:13:20.760 --> 2:13:23.760]  When you and I hit 40, we should have a good life.
[2:13:23.760 --> 2:13:25.760]  The other 40 years should be just as good as the first 40.
[2:13:25.760 --> 2:13:30.760]  But because of eugenics, they want to end it sooner and make it really painful and difficult for all of us.
[2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:34.760]  Yeah, no, that's the stated plan. The White House says so right here.
[2:13:34.760 --> 2:13:41.760]  Alex, Vitamin C, they say Vitamin C is a really great vitamin to defend against as well as D in fish oil.
[2:13:41.760 --> 2:13:46.760]  Well, Vitamin C, the doctors have done the studies and you can Google the studies or search engine the study.
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:49.760]  You need 3,000 to 4,000 milligrams of Vitamin C a day.
[2:13:49.760 --> 2:13:53.760]  What is the U.S. recommended daily allowance? About 85.
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:13:58.760]  How much are you going to be able to get after Codex, Alimentarius is in place? Zero.
[2:13:58.760 --> 2:14:01.760]  I know I appreciate your call and the public just doesn't listen.
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:09.760]  They're already having SWAT team raids on Alivara facilities saying it's now can get you high.
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:14.760]  And in Europe, some areas of Europe, they're pushing to have raids on it.
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:21.760]  Again, the main thing the establishment has over us is the over the topness of this.
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:25.760]  And that I understand as normal people who are awake, you don't want to be around this.
[2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:30.760]  You don't want to focus on it. You want to just stay yourself, try to raise your kids right.
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:32.760]  You can't do that.
[2:14:32.760 --> 2:14:37.760]  And I understand how you want to pull your head down and not fight the tyranny.
[2:14:37.760 --> 2:14:41.760]  Because I do it sometimes. I catch myself.
[2:14:41.760 --> 2:14:46.760]  Like I said, Saturday morning, I just been fighting tyranny for three days in Hardin, Montana.
[2:14:46.760 --> 2:14:51.760]  I went downstairs at like 7am, 730 to get Starbucks coffee down the street.
[2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:57.760]  I'm coming back up the elevator. It opens on the third floor and there's girl scouts milling around with police.
[2:14:57.760 --> 2:15:03.760]  So I step out and there's a Homeland Security banner and cops like it was the airport looking at everybody
[2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:06.760]  and all a bunch of paranoid power tripping people.
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:11.760]  And I literally didn't panic. I repulsed from it.
[2:15:11.760 --> 2:15:17.760]  I like a turtle going in my shell. I was hitting buttons and getting back on.
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:23.760]  And I keep telling that story because then as we're walking out of the hotel 30 minutes later to go catch our flight,
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:28.760]  I said, by the way, I didn't tell you guys on the third floor, there's a Homeland Security convention with girl scouts.
[2:15:28.760 --> 2:15:32.760]  The entire third floor is full of them. There's some kind of Homeland Security meeting.
[2:15:32.760 --> 2:15:38.760]  And we know from the news that their new badge from Homeland Security is to spy on their neighbors, fight terror,
[2:15:38.760 --> 2:15:43.760]  put out the good word of Homeland Security. These are quotes, 3.4 million.
[2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:49.760]  And Aaron's like grabbed by the arm. He goes, let's go. And I said, no, we got an hour and a half to get to the airport.
[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:55.760]  Our plane's in an hour and a half. And thank God we were in the checkpoint for 30 minutes with them searching us
[2:15:55.760 --> 2:16:01.760]  and going over every tape and bugging their eyes out. Just Nazi little pig nose bastards.
[2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:05.760]  I mean, they would, they would, they got you in a minute. They'd hang you up by your heels in a minute.
[2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:11.760]  I mean, I mean, they were crazed women stalking and asking old ladies and like a woman, you've got mascara.
[2:16:11.760 --> 2:16:16.760]  That's illegal, which by the way, even under their rules, it's not in the woman. I'm so sorry. Please don't arrest me.
[2:16:16.760 --> 2:16:22.760]  And evil women going just feeding off of it. And I was like, I mean, folks, I can't handle it.
[2:16:22.760 --> 2:16:25.760]  Elevator doors open and there's Homeland Security with little kids.
[2:16:25.760 --> 2:16:31.760]  And then I got to go to the airport and deal with weird pig women. And I mean, you know, they look, I mean, folks, I can't handle it.
[2:16:31.760 --> 2:16:38.760]  I mean, these women's eyes, I can't even do it. We're like, and I was looking at this woman staring at me in line.
[2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:43.760]  And I started staring back at her and she kind of got excited and came over by the side, was looking at me about two feet away.
[2:16:43.760 --> 2:16:49.760]  And I was just like, I was, I was horrified by her, how disgusting she was, how evil.
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:54.760]  And then I was all look Limburg lived here. They had a big, big painting up and a sign.
[2:16:54.760 --> 2:16:56.760]  And I was looking and they're like, I heard him going, what's he looking at?
[2:16:56.760 --> 2:16:59.760]  What's he, you're not even allowed to look just because I tried to act normal.
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:03.760]  I tried to, okay, I'm going to ignore them feeding on power trips right now.
[2:17:03.760 --> 2:17:12.760]  I'm just going to just go look Limburg and that though they singled us out, went over, pulled out the tiny lotion.
[2:17:12.760 --> 2:17:18.760]  Just went, oh my God, you could be arrested for this. And they were just, and I just looked at them pathetically.
[2:17:18.760 --> 2:17:23.760]  I mean, literally this, this one woman went, you're not allowed to have this.
[2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:26.760]  I mean, they're just like ready to come in your houses and grab your kids.
[2:17:26.760 --> 2:17:33.760]  They're just, just, just waiting to jump on the American people. Just like attack dogs on a chain.
[2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:40.760]  You know, just, I mean, it's sick folks. Total tyrannies here. Don't say you weren't warned.
[2:17:40.760 --> 2:17:43.760]  Dan in New Mexico, you're on the air.
[2:17:43.760 --> 2:17:51.760]  Well, we would have to be willingly blind to not be able to look around and realize we're right in the middle of the book of revelations.
[2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:56.760]  Listen, listen, it's like, it's like termites where you rip aside the wall, there's other termites.
[2:17:56.760 --> 2:18:02.760]  I mean, that's just tyranny everywhere, dude. Hotel doors randomly open and I'm in Homeland Security with the kids.
[2:18:02.760 --> 2:18:08.760]  I mean, they're everywhere, breeding around us, building up for their attack on us. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[2:18:08.760 --> 2:18:16.760]  They're so attracted to you because you carry the light, my friend. I mean, you are, you are a light in the pit of darkness and it intimidates them.
[2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:22.760]  Well, they were harassing like a 90 year old woman in a wheelchair too. They're attracted by herd animals. It's a predator thing.
[2:18:22.760 --> 2:18:28.760]  They see somebody going, you know, it's, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[2:18:28.760 --> 2:18:36.760]  It's like a pack of wolves on an innocent lamb, but you never cease to amaze me. How much information you know, man.
[2:18:36.760 --> 2:18:42.760]  And that's just why I'm calling you. I'm in the military and I am not going to take the vaccination.
[2:18:42.760 --> 2:18:50.760]  That's right. I need your help. What can I quote them? What kind of articles can I print out and take to them to back up?
[2:18:50.760 --> 2:18:56.760]  When I tell them that it's full of squealing and all that crap, but I'm not going to take it because we come down to it.
[2:18:56.760 --> 2:19:00.760]  But they tell me it's mandatory and I have to. I'm going to go to the commander and get out. I'm not doing it.
[2:19:00.760 --> 2:19:05.760]  I'm not going to happen, but that's right. I need your help. What can I, what can I quote?
[2:19:05.760 --> 2:19:13.760]  Okay. Just like public schools, it's a policy. They tried to force anthrax and smallpox shots on the troops.
[2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:20.760]  And because the medical corps in the army and Air Force said no every time because of all the deaths, they saw the deaths happening.
[2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:28.760]  It got suspended, but not before the carnage. So the main thing is they can't force you in the military to take an experimental vaccine.
[2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:36.760]  This vaccine was never properly approved. In fact, that's in my stack here. I'm going to get to that later in the flu section.
[2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:41.760]  So it was never, it's never been properly tested or approved. They can't make you take an experimental.
[2:19:41.760 --> 2:19:45.760]  They admitted has squealing and a bunch of articles you can pull up.
[2:19:45.760 --> 2:19:49.760]  And you can also say, well, the commander in chief says, I don't have to take it.
[2:19:49.760 --> 2:19:55.760]  And you could show them the nursing group suing saying it's dangerous, not wanting to take it.
[2:19:55.760 --> 2:19:58.760]  Stay there. I'll come back to you after this break.
[2:20:25.760 --> 2:20:32.760]  And a five stage carbon and UV light filtration system, which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[2:20:32.760 --> 2:20:36.760]  Finally, drinking water that you control. I use one every day.

[2:21:01.760 --> 2:21:08.760]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:21:08.760 --> 2:21:12.760]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:21:12.760 --> 2:21:14.760]  Bin Laden. This is his M.O.
[2:21:14.760 --> 2:21:17.760]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to his home of Bin Laden.
[2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:24.760]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:21:24.760 --> 2:21:31.760]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:21:31.760 --> 2:21:35.760]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:21:35.760 --> 2:21:42.760]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:21:42.760 --> 2:21:47.760]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[2:22:01.760 --> 2:22:08.760]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[2:22:08.760 --> 2:22:16.760]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:22:16.760 --> 2:22:22.760]  Is this a flaw for enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt,
[2:22:22.760 --> 2:22:29.760]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[2:22:29.760 --> 2:22:34.760]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[2:22:34.760 --> 2:22:38.760]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[2:24:13.760 --> 2:24:17.760]  This is CNN, folks. This is the type of stuff on TV.
[2:24:17.760 --> 2:24:24.760]  They were literally just worshiping Obama saying, our country will go bankrupt if we don't have the people run healthcare through the government.
[2:24:24.760 --> 2:24:30.760]  And then they were singing some song about the flu vaccine and how great it is and saying, yes, we can.
[2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:34.760]  And little military uniforms worshiping Obama on CNN.
[2:24:34.760 --> 2:24:37.760]  I mean, that's what I mean. This country's gone, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:24:37.760 --> 2:24:46.760]  I mean, and they bring these poor kids up there to push government takeover of healthcare.
[2:24:46.760 --> 2:24:51.760]  I just can't handle it anymore. Turn up this nightmare again.
[2:24:55.760 --> 2:25:00.760]  I wonder if they'll sing Obama loves all the little children, red, yellow, black and white.
[2:25:00.760 --> 2:25:03.760]  They're all equal in the president's side. I mean, they're already teaching in public school.
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:07.760]  He's Jesus. Let me give people a little tip.
[2:25:07.760 --> 2:25:11.760]  You're not in a free country when they're changing Christian hymns over to the president.
[2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:14.760]  I want to give everybody a little tip there.
[2:25:14.760 --> 2:25:17.760]  By the way, they have announced they're handing over internet control to the U.N.
[2:25:17.760 --> 2:25:20.760]  And it's being hailed as, oh, the U.S. doesn't control it anymore.
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:25.760]  No, the private ICANN corporation can now do whatever it wants with internet too.
[2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:27.760]  So that's coming up.
[2:25:27.760 --> 2:25:29.760]  Look at this article.
[2:25:29.760 --> 2:25:37.760]  Now, I remember about 10 years ago seeing the New York Times saying in the future that the new economy will be nothing but prisons.
[2:25:37.760 --> 2:25:45.760]  And how good that is and how they're going to pay citizen volunteers $1,000 a month, welfare people.
[2:25:45.760 --> 2:25:52.760]  You want your money, you got to do this with a computer in their house that watches CCTV cameras in another city
[2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:59.760]  and that you've got to flag crimes and that fake crimes would be superimposed that DARPA was developing this.
[2:25:59.760 --> 2:26:06.760]  Fake crimes would be superimposed over the video feed to make sure you were reporting or you'd lose your welfare.
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:09.760]  So they're now taking arm and here it is in the register.
[2:26:09.760 --> 2:26:11.760]  This is in England, but same thing here.
[2:26:11.760 --> 2:26:17.760]  Watson was telling me in the town he lives, it's on their cable system where you can go spy on your neighbors on the other side of town.
[2:26:17.760 --> 2:26:21.760]  Local CCTVs on the cable system and they ask you to spy.
[2:26:21.760 --> 2:26:26.760]  And now they're recruiting the Homeland Security, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts.
[2:26:26.760 --> 2:26:28.760]  I mean, folks, here it is.
[2:26:28.760 --> 2:26:35.760]  New Web Service aims to recruit tens of thousands of unpaid watchmen to monitor neglected CCTV cameras nationwide.
[2:26:35.760 --> 2:26:46.760]  Internet eyes, internet eyes.co.uk startup based in Startford upon Avon plans to charge businesses $20, 20 pounds per month
[2:26:46.760 --> 2:26:51.760]  for members of its website to watch live feeds and report incidents via text message.
[2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:56.760]  And return members will be entered into a crime fighting league, a league,
[2:26:56.760 --> 2:27:00.760]  receiving points for each genuine incident reported at the end of each month.
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:03.760]  The top scorer will receive $1,000 cash reward.
[2:27:03.760 --> 2:27:06.760]  It's not a game. We're fighting crime and terrorism.
[2:27:06.760 --> 2:27:09.760]  See, first it was terror, now it's crime and terror.
[2:27:09.760 --> 2:27:12.760]  I'm going to shut up and go back to the callers.
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:17.760]  Dan in New Mexico, you were asking how you get the military to not forcibly inject you.
[2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:18.760]  Here's the deal.
[2:27:18.760 --> 2:27:23.760]  You hold out long enough until enough medical corps has refused.
[2:27:23.760 --> 2:27:25.760]  It's already lawsuits are already filed.
[2:27:25.760 --> 2:27:27.760]  The troops are already fighting.
[2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:31.760]  The physicians in the military are already saying no.
[2:27:31.760 --> 2:27:36.760]  If you can hold out and say, well, if you want to be a moral about it,
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:38.760]  you say, look, I'm not going to make a big stink out of this.
[2:27:38.760 --> 2:27:42.760]  I'm not calling for, you know, you can feed on them.
[2:27:42.760 --> 2:27:43.760]  I'm not taking it.
[2:27:43.760 --> 2:27:48.760]  If you make a big deal out of it, they'll try to court-martial you if you try to warn other slaves.
[2:27:48.760 --> 2:27:55.760]  But the military is a special group for them because that's who they test the chemical and biologicals and radiologicals on.
[2:27:55.760 --> 2:28:01.760]  They march our troops into chambers and nerve gas and routinely project shadow their operations that are declassified.
[2:28:01.760 --> 2:28:06.760]  So they already test biologicals and chemicals and radiologicals on you.
[2:28:06.760 --> 2:28:11.760]  So they love that precedent that you're the final testing before the American people.
[2:28:11.760 --> 2:28:13.760]  You're literally like lab rats to them.
[2:28:13.760 --> 2:28:19.760]  Once they asked a top scientist in the weapons program, atomic scientists, why are we using troops?
[2:28:19.760 --> 2:28:20.760]  Why don't we use monkeys?
[2:28:20.760 --> 2:28:23.760]  And he said monkeys are a lot cheaper.
[2:28:23.760 --> 2:28:27.760]  I mean, humans are a lot cheaper than monkeys.
[2:28:27.760 --> 2:28:32.760]  And so you can bring them the articles admitting it's got squalene.
[2:28:32.760 --> 2:28:36.760]  You can bring them the articles admitting it's experimental and wasn't properly tested.
[2:28:36.760 --> 2:28:38.760]  I'm going to go over some of those later.
[2:28:38.760 --> 2:28:39.760]  I got to go through my stack here.
[2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:47.760]  I mean, you can explain to them the best loophole you've got is under army regulations or Pentagon regulations.
[2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:53.760]  They can't force you to take an experimental vaccine and it still is experimental, never, never fully approved.
[2:28:53.760 --> 2:28:55.760]  They're doing it under emergency auspices.
[2:28:55.760 --> 2:29:02.760]  But even with the anthrax and smallpox, it took a bunch of deaths before they quit under rebellion.
[2:29:02.760 --> 2:29:06.760]  Now they're coming back with a new group five, six years later.
[2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:10.760]  And so I don't know what to tell you.
[2:29:10.760 --> 2:29:13.760]  But does that rant answer your question there, Dan?
[2:29:13.760 --> 2:29:19.760]  Yeah, for the most part, I think I'm armed with the information that I need to know now.
[2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:20.760]  I do appreciate that.
[2:29:20.760 --> 2:29:21.760]  And I thank you.
[2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:24.760]  Hey, one thing about prisonclass.tv.
[2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:26.760]  I have a problem with Terror Storm.
[2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:32.760]  Will you pardon up Terror Storm for all the Republicans for me on a special deal?
[2:29:32.760 --> 2:29:33.760]  I'm confused.
[2:29:33.760 --> 2:29:34.760]  What are you saying?
[2:29:34.760 --> 2:29:35.760]  You're saying it won't play for you?
[2:29:35.760 --> 2:29:36.760]  Right.
[2:29:36.760 --> 2:29:39.760]  When I download the.movie file, it won't play.
[2:29:39.760 --> 2:29:42.760]  I'll have the guys look into it.
[2:29:42.760 --> 2:29:44.760]  Sometime in five years, it should be fixed.
[2:29:44.760 --> 2:29:45.760]  I'm joking.
[2:29:45.760 --> 2:29:48.760]  We're in the process of re-uploading everything, too.
[2:29:48.760 --> 2:29:52.760]  Give us your email right now, and we'll just send you.
[2:29:52.760 --> 2:29:53.760]  We're on the march.
[2:29:53.760 --> 2:29:55.760]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:55.760 --> 2:30:01.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:01.760 --> 2:30:02.760]  Hello, friends.
[2:30:02.760 --> 2:30:05.760]  This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[2:30:05.760 --> 2:30:07.760]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:11.760]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[2:30:11.760 --> 2:30:16.760]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[2:30:16.760 --> 2:30:19.760]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive,
[2:30:19.760 --> 2:30:21.760]  immune, and developmental system diseases.
[2:30:21.760 --> 2:30:23.760]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[2:30:23.760 --> 2:30:28.760]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control
[2:30:28.760 --> 2:30:30.760]  of you and your family's drinking water.
[2:30:30.760 --> 2:30:34.760]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[2:30:34.760 --> 2:30:38.760]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis,
[2:30:38.760 --> 2:30:40.760]  and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[2:30:40.760 --> 2:30:41.760]  That's right.
[2:30:41.760 --> 2:30:43.760]  Clean water right from the air you breathe.

[2:33:38.760 --> 2:33:45.760]  I told myself that I was going to be calm and relaxed when I got back to Austin.
[2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:50.760]  Because I am really sick of the New World Order.
[2:33:50.760 --> 2:33:54.760]  I can't explain to you how sick of the New World Order I am.
[2:33:54.760 --> 2:33:58.760]  I'm tired of nobodies that get positions of power and government rank
[2:33:58.760 --> 2:34:02.760]  urinating all over everybody.
[2:34:02.760 --> 2:34:06.760]  Yeah, 1 in 91 in the United States now have autism.
[2:34:06.760 --> 2:34:08.760]  And that's not just over-reporting.
[2:34:08.760 --> 2:34:10.760]  You walk around and look at kids on the streets.
[2:34:10.760 --> 2:34:12.760]  You try to go to a movie.
[2:34:12.760 --> 2:34:15.760]  I tried to take my kids every once in a while and I took them to see up.
[2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:18.760]  Front two rows were autistic.
[2:34:18.760 --> 2:34:20.760]  Just howling and screaming.
[2:34:20.760 --> 2:34:22.760]  I felt so sorry for them.
[2:34:22.760 --> 2:34:26.760]  You know, they'd see a part they liked and get excited.
[2:34:26.760 --> 2:34:28.760]  You didn't see that when I was a kid.
[2:34:28.760 --> 2:34:31.760]  No, these people, like seeing them this morning, was going,
[2:34:31.760 --> 2:34:33.760]  What's going on?
[2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:35.760]  Is it something in the water?
[2:34:35.760 --> 2:34:37.760]  Is it something in the food?
[2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:40.760]  Hell, yes it is, lady.
[2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:43.760]  Half of corn syrup products have high levels of mercury.
[2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:46.760]  That'll completely brain damage a kid.
[2:34:46.760 --> 2:34:51.760]  They put extra fluoride in bottled water just for babies.
[2:34:51.760 --> 2:34:56.760]  They know sodium fluoride retards the growth massively in children.
[2:34:56.760 --> 2:34:59.760]  They know it increases bone cancer, dental fluorosis.
[2:34:59.760 --> 2:35:03.760]  This is all admitted.
[2:35:03.760 --> 2:35:06.760]  One of the scientists that helped develop the Gardasil shot
[2:35:06.760 --> 2:35:10.760]  is now saying, don't give it to children, it'll kill you.
[2:35:10.760 --> 2:35:15.760]  Do they care? No.
[2:35:15.760 --> 2:35:24.760]  I mean, you go to the shopping mall now and it looks like the public's been hit with a mutation ray.
[2:35:24.760 --> 2:35:27.760]  But they'll just make, on CNN and all the other channels,
[2:35:27.760 --> 2:35:30.760]  they'll make a big thing out of it and, you know, a big community thing
[2:35:30.760 --> 2:35:35.760]  and have local groups and we'll fund big medical firms to find out what did it
[2:35:35.760 --> 2:35:39.760]  when they're the ones that did it with the mercury and the shots more than anything.
[2:35:39.760 --> 2:35:44.760]  It's like, gee, I pumped my baby at birth with nine different shots.
[2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:47.760]  I mean, think about that. Huge injectors filled with liquid,
[2:35:47.760 --> 2:35:51.760]  full of RNA, DNA from the animals, they grew it on the tissue,
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:55.760]  just pumping mercury into them and then the babies, I mean, babies routinely,
[2:35:55.760 --> 2:35:58.760]  and then they're like, can't even nurse.
[2:35:58.760 --> 2:36:00.760]  Everybody talks about it at the hospitals.
[2:36:00.760 --> 2:36:05.760]  Kids like, gee, I wonder why my 18 month old was so happy
[2:36:05.760 --> 2:36:07.760]  until he got its third round of shots.
[2:36:07.760 --> 2:36:13.760]  Kids like, mommy, daddy, next thing, you know, gee, I wonder what happened.
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:16.760]  The kids are having a convulsion in the car home.
[2:36:16.760 --> 2:36:18.760]  You take the kid back to the hospital.
[2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:20.760]  They're going to CPS them and said they shook them.
[2:36:20.760 --> 2:36:22.760]  They're going to CAT scan and go, look, brain inflammation.
[2:36:22.760 --> 2:36:24.760]  You beat your child.
[2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:25.760]  You're like, no, no, I didn't.
[2:36:25.760 --> 2:36:27.760]  The cops are there.
[2:36:27.760 --> 2:36:30.760]  We got somebody for the grid. We got to fill these big ass prisons everywhere.
[2:36:30.760 --> 2:36:33.760]  You're like, but my kid had a convulsion after the shot.
[2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:35.760]  Shut up.
[2:36:35.760 --> 2:36:37.760]  Give me a building club.
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:40.760]  It isn't enough. We brain damaged your kid.
[2:36:40.760 --> 2:36:42.760]  Now we're going to have more.
[2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:44.760]  Yeah, we rule.
[2:36:44.760 --> 2:36:46.760]  Eugenics, we're poisoning your water.
[2:36:46.760 --> 2:36:48.760]  Hell yeah.
[2:36:48.760 --> 2:37:00.760]  Hell yeah. It's fun.
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:04.760]  I mean, it's freaking me out, folks, to sit and watch them having their way with us.
[2:37:04.760 --> 2:37:11.760]  All right, let's go back to calls as I promised.
[2:37:11.760 --> 2:37:15.760]  Gary in Ohio, then Andrew, Summer, Brian, Catherine, go ahead, Gary.
[2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:17.760]  Yeah, it's good to hear from you.
[2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:19.760]  I got a couple things I'd like to bring up.
[2:37:19.760 --> 2:37:25.760]  We have a Continental Congress coming up, people trying to straighten out the Constitution
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:27.760]  and get us right back to it and such.
[2:37:27.760 --> 2:37:34.760]  The vote is this weekend, the 10th, actually, and people can Google it up
[2:37:34.760 --> 2:37:38.760]  and look at the people that they have a possibility of voting for in their area.
[2:37:38.760 --> 2:37:41.760]  The whole country is supposed to have the vote this weekend,
[2:37:41.760 --> 2:37:48.760]  and we'll see if we can start straightening this out from bringing a government that the people have back up.
[2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:54.760]  Also, I'd like to discuss the Civilian National Security Force for just a second.
[2:37:54.760 --> 2:37:58.760]  Isn't that already the militia? We just got to reactivate that one?
[2:37:58.760 --> 2:38:01.760]  Yeah, do me a favor and turn your radio off.
[2:38:01.760 --> 2:38:02.760]  Okay.
[2:38:02.760 --> 2:38:07.760]  It's really rough to hear what you're saying with that going in the background.
[2:38:07.760 --> 2:38:11.760]  Yes, everything government does is to create an evil counterfeit.
[2:38:11.760 --> 2:38:15.760]  And so they're saying we're going to have a national security force of environmental spies,
[2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:22.760]  anti-terror spies, CPS spies, everything's illegal, garage sales, keeping your neighbor's kids,
[2:38:22.760 --> 2:38:26.760]  everything's evil, having a Bible meeting, everything's evil, but evil.
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:28.760]  Evil is good and protected.
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:35.760]  And they lie and say that gun ownership is only for the National Guard, the militia,
[2:38:35.760 --> 2:38:38.760]  but the National Guard didn't exist till 1906.
[2:38:38.760 --> 2:38:42.760]  Was it officially chartered in 1904? I forget, but 1906 something.
[2:38:42.760 --> 2:38:47.760]  And no, it's every able-bodied man, 18 to 54.
[2:38:47.760 --> 2:38:48.760]  And that's what it is.
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:54.760]  So that's why they demonize that, which is supposed to be your local constabulary, your local men.
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:58.760]  You can't have men protecting only government.
[2:38:58.760 --> 2:39:03.760]  You can't have a citizen who doesn't, who hadn't paid tax money, who protects the community.
[2:39:03.760 --> 2:39:07.760]  You got to have somebody that can arrest some people, steal some property.
[2:39:07.760 --> 2:39:08.760]  And so that's what's going on.
[2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:09.760]  I appreciate your call.
[2:39:09.760 --> 2:39:12.760]  Andrew in D.C., Andrew, you're on the air.
[2:39:12.760 --> 2:39:14.760]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[2:39:14.760 --> 2:39:16.760]  Pretty upset about things.
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:17.760]  Yes.
[2:39:17.760 --> 2:39:18.760]  Because I'm wondering what comes next?
[2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:19.760]  I know what comes next.
[2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:25.760]  More staged terror attacks, total depression, hordes of people worshiping government,
[2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:29.760]  kids with armbands on street corners with TV ads about how they're heroes,
[2:39:29.760 --> 2:39:33.760]  and we'll have to worship the Eugen or we're anti-American,
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:36.760]  and lots of drunks stumbling around going,
[2:39:36.760 --> 2:39:40.760]  look at my son, Jr. He's a member of the Homeland Brigade
[2:39:40.760 --> 2:39:44.760]  and cops, microwave gunning, peaceful crowds of people,
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:50.760]  and the feds stealing ranches and farms and getting locals on their team to help steal them
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:53.760]  and just fire fights and war and everything else.
[2:39:53.760 --> 2:39:55.760]  The whole tyranny.
[2:39:55.760 --> 2:39:56.760]  Yeah.
[2:39:56.760 --> 2:40:01.760]  I had a quick comment about a news story I just read on the Huffington Post.
[2:40:01.760 --> 2:40:04.760]  I'm not sure if you've heard of this yet,
[2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:08.760]  but apparently the FBI just arrested a New Yorker
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:12.760]  for using Twitter to direct the movement of protesters.
[2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:13.760]  Yeah.
[2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:15.760]  London Guardian's reporting on this.
[2:40:15.760 --> 2:40:18.760]  New York man accused of using Twitter to direct protests during G20,
[2:40:18.760 --> 2:40:22.760]  and they said that, see, the police would surround the groups.
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:24.760]  This happened to Rob Do and say, leave.
[2:40:24.760 --> 2:40:26.760]  They wouldn't let you leave.
[2:40:26.760 --> 2:40:29.760]  And so he was directing them saying, here's a spot to get out.
[2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:31.760]  So they're charging him as a terrorist.
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:32.760]  Yes.
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:35.760]  You're not allowed to tell people how to follow police orders.
[2:40:35.760 --> 2:40:36.760]  Right.
[2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:40.760]  And then I just can't get over how nonchalantly in the article,
[2:40:40.760 --> 2:40:44.760]  they just state that it's his political writings, even.
[2:40:44.760 --> 2:40:45.760]  Yeah.
[2:40:45.760 --> 2:40:48.760]  They say that's illegal, that he showed he has political ideas and writings
[2:40:48.760 --> 2:40:50.760]  and protests is illegal.
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:52.760]  Having political writings is basically illegal.
[2:40:52.760 --> 2:40:56.760]  They're handing the US internet that we built completely over
[2:40:56.760 --> 2:40:58.760]  to a private consortium.
[2:40:58.760 --> 2:41:00.760]  That happened on Monday.
[2:41:00.760 --> 2:41:02.760]  And we've just entered a vortex.
[2:41:02.760 --> 2:41:06.760]  And I just had one other quick question.
[2:41:06.760 --> 2:41:10.760]  I know you talked about earlier how you've been to DC a few times.
[2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:13.760]  I was wondering if you've ever traveled to Baltimore, Maryland
[2:41:13.760 --> 2:41:18.760]  and seen any of the police state measures they've started there
[2:41:18.760 --> 2:41:20.760]  under the name of the war on drugs.
[2:41:20.760 --> 2:41:25.760]  Yes, they have armored vehicles, checkpoints, searching people randomly.
[2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:29.760]  They're taking blood in Maryland at checkpoints without warrants.
[2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:32.760]  It's just hellish tyranny and they love it.
[2:41:32.760 --> 2:41:35.760]  And the cops enjoy the fact that you don't like them.
[2:41:35.760 --> 2:41:37.760]  They enjoy the fact.
[2:41:37.760 --> 2:41:41.760]  I read about a guy they tried to kill on death row for two hours
[2:41:41.760 --> 2:41:43.760]  trying to find a vein.
[2:41:43.760 --> 2:41:48.760]  Well, the cops, it's reported just fishing needles into people in Arizona.
[2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:52.760]  I mean, they'll just sit and they'll get mad and just be like,
[2:41:52.760 --> 2:41:57.760]  you know, just like niggling it around all in there, just gruggling it around.
[2:41:57.760 --> 2:41:59.760]  You're just screaming.
[2:41:59.760 --> 2:42:02.760]  If you don't like it, they'll, ah, Billy Club the Slap.
[2:42:02.760 --> 2:42:05.760]  I got this job because I'm a sado massacre.
[2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:09.760]  Ah, you know, it's just, yeah, and that's the new system,
[2:42:09.760 --> 2:42:15.760]  just grabbing the slaves, injecting hell force.
[2:42:15.760 --> 2:42:19.760]  And on top of that, they've actually, I don't know if you've heard of Baltimore's
[2:42:19.760 --> 2:42:24.760]  Believe program, which is total propaganda to begin with, but they've actually
[2:42:24.760 --> 2:42:28.760]  installed these, they call them blue light cameras.
[2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:31.760]  They're on the corners in the especially poor neighborhoods.
[2:42:31.760 --> 2:42:38.760]  They have the Baltimore police emblem on them and they say believe under them
[2:42:38.760 --> 2:42:44.760]  and the police officers in the Baltimore Police Department can access them from their police cars
[2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:49.760]  and zoom in, um, even down the block into someone's car to watch what they're doing.
[2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:53.760]  Oh no, and they also are putting our, I read in DC and New York and Baltimore,
[2:42:53.760 --> 2:42:59.760]  what England's had for five years, cameras that bark orders at you, tele screens,
[2:42:59.760 --> 2:43:03.760]  and some of them even have a face where it makes a mean face like stop that.
[2:43:03.760 --> 2:43:05.760]  So, you know, a computer TV screen.
[2:43:05.760 --> 2:43:06.760]  Oh yeah.
[2:43:06.760 --> 2:43:08.760]  Hey, listen, and don't worry, cops, you're winning.
[2:43:08.760 --> 2:43:11.760]  Take all the shots, drink the tap water, worship government.
[2:43:11.760 --> 2:43:14.760]  You're going to end up just like the German forces.
[2:43:14.760 --> 2:43:16.760]  You're just going to love what you get.
[2:43:16.760 --> 2:43:17.760]  Don't worry.
[2:43:17.760 --> 2:43:18.760]  You end up losing in the end.
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:20.760]  I appreciate your call.
[2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:22.760]  Evil Andrew from DC knows how to talk.
[2:43:22.760 --> 2:43:24.760]  That's a sign of al-qaeda support.
[2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:26.760]  Summer in Indiana, summer.
[2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:27.760]  You're on the air.
[2:43:27.760 --> 2:43:28.760]  Hello, Alex.
[2:43:28.760 --> 2:43:29.760]  How are you?
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:31.760]  Pretty sick of it all.
[2:43:31.760 --> 2:43:32.760]  Me too.
[2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:36.760]  Uh, just want to let you know, uh, we went ahead and preordered the fall of the
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:40.760]  Republic, got the Obama deception and end game as well.
[2:43:40.760 --> 2:43:45.760]  I have a stack of a hundred DVDs and a brand new burner getting ready to go off.
[2:43:45.760 --> 2:43:49.760]  Well, that's what I wanted to ask listeners to do is to commit to fighting
[2:43:49.760 --> 2:43:52.760]  these tyrants because now that they're really showing us who they are,
[2:43:52.760 --> 2:43:56.760]  everybody's waking up and they're trying to intimidate us into submitting.
[2:43:56.760 --> 2:43:57.760]  It's not going to work.
[2:43:57.760 --> 2:44:01.760]  We're going to throw this off, throw this coil off, throw this yolk off.
[2:44:01.760 --> 2:44:06.760]  And I just want everybody to get the DVD burners locked in loaded and hit the
[2:44:06.760 --> 2:44:10.760]  new world order hard with fall of the Republic is we're going to show people
[2:44:10.760 --> 2:44:12.760]  who the criminals are, who the enemy is.
[2:44:12.760 --> 2:44:13.760]  Go ahead.
[2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:19.760]  Well, I just wonder if you were in Terre Haute, Indiana for Timothy McBae's
[2:44:19.760 --> 2:44:20.760]  execution.
[2:44:20.760 --> 2:44:22.760]  No, I wasn't there for that.
[2:44:22.760 --> 2:44:23.760]  All right.
[2:44:23.760 --> 2:44:24.760]  Well, I want it.
[2:44:24.760 --> 2:44:27.760]  I was just curious because if you were, I wanted to ask you as close you were to
[2:44:27.760 --> 2:44:29.760]  the VX gas.
[2:44:29.760 --> 2:44:36.760]  We have our supply, nation's supply of VX gas here in Indiana, about 15 miles
[2:44:36.760 --> 2:44:38.760]  away from my home.
[2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:43.760]  And they're telling us all that, you know, it was supposed to be destroyed by
[2:44:43.760 --> 2:44:45.760]  2012, but it's already gone.
[2:44:45.760 --> 2:44:51.760]  And just to get your take on it, you know, and I'm freaked out about it.
[2:44:51.760 --> 2:44:55.760]  Well, they do have nerve gas at centers all over the country.
[2:44:55.760 --> 2:44:58.760]  One of the places they used to get rid of it is Aniston, Alabama.
[2:44:58.760 --> 2:45:00.760]  And that is a smokestack you want to worry about.
[2:45:00.760 --> 2:45:04.760]  They burn VX gas and other forms of nerve gas around the country.
[2:45:04.760 --> 2:45:06.760]  Good to hear from you, Summer.
[2:45:06.760 --> 2:45:08.760]  Brian in Montreal, Canada.
[2:45:08.760 --> 2:45:09.760]  Brian, you're on the air.
[2:45:09.760 --> 2:45:10.760]  Hi, Alex.
[2:45:10.760 --> 2:45:12.760]  I'd just like to mention two things.
[2:45:12.760 --> 2:45:16.760]  The first is a news you could say up here in Quebec.
[2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:20.760]  We have private clinics that are free, that are controlled and run by the
[2:45:20.760 --> 2:45:21.760]  government.
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:22.760]  They're called CLSCs.
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:27.760]  Well, I have the internal document that they received last month telling all of
[2:45:27.760 --> 2:45:30.760]  their healthcare workers that, yes, they will be forced to take the
[2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:32.760]  inoculation shot.
[2:45:32.760 --> 2:45:36.760]  They have to consider the public's risk over their own personal
[2:45:36.760 --> 2:45:37.760]  preferences.
[2:45:37.760 --> 2:45:40.760]  So this is happening up here in Quebec, too.
[2:45:40.760 --> 2:45:41.760]  Yeah, it's global.
[2:45:41.760 --> 2:45:44.760]  I mean, this is all directed by the UN publicly under the World Health
[2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:45.760]  Organization.
[2:45:45.760 --> 2:45:48.760]  And here's the issue.
[2:45:48.760 --> 2:45:52.760]  And I already knew this, but to see them admitted on Fox News like it was a
[2:45:52.760 --> 2:45:56.760]  good thing, they said, oh, people really want it, but there's only limited
[2:45:56.760 --> 2:46:01.760]  supplies of 200,000 dosages going to Indiana and going to Texas and going to
[2:46:01.760 --> 2:46:05.760]  New York for nurses and medical workers and police.
[2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:09.760]  And it's a nasal spray of live flu virus.
[2:46:09.760 --> 2:46:12.760]  And yes, it can spread the flu.
[2:46:12.760 --> 2:46:16.760]  And yes, it can hurt you if you have an autoimmune problem.
[2:46:16.760 --> 2:46:17.760]  But that's okay.
[2:46:17.760 --> 2:46:24.760]  So they're literally going to spread the H1N1 with a live nasal shot spray.
[2:46:24.760 --> 2:46:28.760]  And then everybody's going to panic when suddenly it's spreading.
[2:46:28.760 --> 2:46:32.760]  Just they do it in plain view because the public doesn't know what day it is.
[2:46:32.760 --> 2:46:34.760]  They don't know.
[2:46:34.760 --> 2:46:38.760]  It's mind blowing.
[2:46:38.760 --> 2:46:42.760]  It is mind blowing to see all this going on.
[2:46:42.760 --> 2:46:45.760]  If it's all right with you, Alex, I'd just also like to mention that on the site
[2:46:45.760 --> 2:46:50.760]  that I'm on most of the time, 12-160, I have a ChemTrail reporting page.
[2:46:50.760 --> 2:46:56.760]  And I have the 1975 Weather Modification Treaty between Canada and the U.S. up on it.
[2:46:56.760 --> 2:47:01.760]  So for any of the clowns out there that actually believe that they're responsible for polluting
[2:47:01.760 --> 2:47:05.760]  and that we should be paying a carbon tax, you might want to go and read that treaty
[2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:09.760]  and a few of the patents that I put up to see what they've been spraying over your head for a while.
[2:47:09.760 --> 2:47:10.760]  I hear you.
[2:47:10.760 --> 2:47:11.760]  And they now admit they've been doing it.
[2:47:11.760 --> 2:47:12.760]  It's now declassified.
[2:47:12.760 --> 2:47:14.760]  They're not even denying it now.
[2:47:14.760 --> 2:47:20.760]  The White House science are publicly give speeches about how they're ChemTrailing you and how great it is.
[2:47:20.760 --> 2:47:31.760]  Now, let's just continue with phone calls, as promised.
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:33.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Katherine in Missouri.
[2:47:33.760 --> 2:47:34.760]  Katherine, you're on the air.
[2:47:34.760 --> 2:47:35.760]  Go ahead.
[2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:36.760]  Hi, Alex.
[2:47:36.760 --> 2:47:39.760]  This is Katherine Gleisch from the documentary Camp FEMA.
[2:47:39.760 --> 2:47:41.760]  Hey, how you doing?
[2:47:41.760 --> 2:47:42.760]  Good.
[2:47:42.760 --> 2:47:45.760]  I wanted to make sure you knew how to pronounce my name.
[2:47:45.760 --> 2:47:46.760]  You said it wrong a couple of times.
[2:47:46.760 --> 2:47:47.760]  It's Gleisch.
[2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:48.760]  Long eye.
[2:47:48.760 --> 2:47:50.760]  Well, you know, that's my specialty, ma'am.
[2:47:50.760 --> 2:47:51.760]  My specialty.
[2:47:51.760 --> 2:47:54.760]  I know you're pretty frustrated right now.
[2:47:54.760 --> 2:47:58.760]  And I know a lot of us are, but there are some things to be hopeful about.
[2:47:58.760 --> 2:48:02.760]  And I feel really blessed to be here in the state of Missouri right now because we have state reps
[2:48:02.760 --> 2:48:05.760]  who are waking up right before our eyes.
[2:48:05.760 --> 2:48:07.760]  And it's the most beautiful thing I've ever been a witness to.
[2:48:07.760 --> 2:48:12.760]  I've been to all four of the MYAC hearings and we are headed in a very positive direction.
[2:48:12.760 --> 2:48:17.760]  I know that Bob Dixon, the chairman of the committee was quoted saying we, you know,
[2:48:17.760 --> 2:48:20.760]  it's unlikely that we will abolish the fusion center.
[2:48:20.760 --> 2:48:25.760]  But one of the things they're considering is getting the federal government out of the fusion center
[2:48:25.760 --> 2:48:28.760]  and making it just a state-based thing, which I think is a special right direction.
[2:48:28.760 --> 2:48:32.760]  Oh, but yeah, but I mean, look, look, the fusion centers were set up by the feds.
[2:48:32.760 --> 2:48:33.760]  They were paid.
[2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:35.760]  They're federalizing everything.
[2:48:35.760 --> 2:48:38.760]  They're putting army liaison in with the police.
[2:48:38.760 --> 2:48:43.760]  They're saying the veterans and gun owners are what Homeland Security's for, which is the truth.
[2:48:43.760 --> 2:48:45.760]  And it just needs to be abolished.
[2:48:45.760 --> 2:48:50.760]  I mean, this whole thing about what you want the terrorists to get us, the terrorists are the government.
[2:48:50.760 --> 2:48:55.760]  They're staging and provocaturing every single terror attack I've ever studied.
[2:48:55.760 --> 2:48:57.760]  But here's the good news.
[2:48:57.760 --> 2:49:01.760]  Our state reps are waking up to the fact that the federal government is the problem.
[2:49:01.760 --> 2:49:03.760]  So I'm happy and excited to report that.
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:08.760]  I also wanted to let you know that Camp FEMA will be having its world premiere of public viewing
[2:49:08.760 --> 2:49:13.760]  at the Midwest Liberty Fest, which is going to be in DeCoin, Illinois this weekend.
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:15.760]  It will actually air on Saturday.
[2:49:15.760 --> 2:49:18.760]  And what's really special about this event, the Midwest Liberty Fest,
[2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:23.760]  is that we are bringing together the anti-war movement, the Tea Party movement, the Ron Pollard.
[2:49:23.760 --> 2:49:29.760]  And for the first time, you are going to see an actual event where real grassroots movers and shakers,
[2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:34.760]  not just talking heads, but people who have found success in things that you are trying to gather.
[2:49:34.760 --> 2:49:35.760]  Good. Good. Well, that's exciting.
[2:49:35.760 --> 2:49:37.760]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call. You do a good job in that documentary.
[2:49:37.760 --> 2:49:45.760]  By the way, you can get Camp FEMA discounted with Fall of the Republic if you ordered it right now.
[2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:47.760]  We have introductory prices on that.

[2:49:49.760 --> 2:49:53.760]  We've got four new T-shirts now in on the shopping cart.
[2:49:53.760 --> 2:49:55.760]  I'm glad you reminded me about that.
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:50:00.760]  We've got four new T-shirts that are up on the site.
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:04.760]  Different variants of the join or die or don't tread on me.
[2:50:04.760 --> 2:50:09.760]  For people that don't like the big bright yellow shirts, we've got white shirts and black shirts,
[2:50:09.760 --> 2:50:11.760]  with a whole bunch of cool designs.
[2:50:11.760 --> 2:50:13.760]  In fact, show folks on the shopping cart.
[2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:20.760]  We've got a new high-tech design we made of the join or die that has info wars on it.
[2:50:20.760 --> 2:50:22.760]  Yeah, there it is, the second shirt.

[2:52:01.760 --> 2:52:03.760]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:52:03.760 --> 2:52:07.760]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[2:52:07.760 --> 2:52:09.760]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[2:52:09.760 --> 2:52:12.760]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:52:12.760 --> 2:52:18.760]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:52:18.760 --> 2:52:22.760]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:52:22.760 --> 2:52:27.760]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[2:52:27.760 --> 2:52:30.760]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[2:53:02.760 --> 2:53:06.760]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-drag guy.
[2:53:06.760 --> 2:53:10.760]  In times of physical and emotional stress like the uncertain times we live in today,
[2:53:10.760 --> 2:53:13.760]  it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[2:53:13.760 --> 2:53:15.760]  You should only store what you usually eat,
[2:53:15.760 --> 2:53:18.760]  because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[2:53:18.760 --> 2:53:20.760]  Lucky for you, there's the freeze-drag guy.
[2:53:20.760 --> 2:53:23.760]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect,
[2:53:23.760 --> 2:53:27.760]  the freeze-drag guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[2:53:27.760 --> 2:53:32.760]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[2:53:32.760 --> 2:53:36.760]  The freeze-drag guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector,
[2:53:36.760 --> 2:53:41.760]  with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[2:53:41.760 --> 2:53:46.760]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s
[2:53:46.760 --> 2:53:48.760]  to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[2:53:48.760 --> 2:53:53.760]  Comparably, the advances made in food storage from the World War II era till now are equally great.

[2:54:13.760 --> 2:54:21.760]  I've got the Mayo Clinic's fact sheet about influenza virus vaccine live nasal route,
[2:54:21.760 --> 2:54:24.760]  and I've got three stacks of news on the flu.
[2:54:24.760 --> 2:54:30.760]  It's so late through this at 8 after next hour, I'm going to do a segment on flu, the latest developments.
[2:54:30.760 --> 2:54:33.760]  I kind of procrastinate when I look at the stack and go,
[2:54:33.760 --> 2:54:38.760]  ugh, because it's so horrible and so unbelievable.
[2:54:38.760 --> 2:54:43.760]  But it's really happening. Influenza, they admit it's going to spread the flu.
[2:54:43.760 --> 2:54:48.760]  I mean, these guys commit huge crimes right out in front of no one and they just get away with it.
[2:54:48.760 --> 2:54:54.760]  It's like Hardin, Montana, where they have a convicted felon for scams running the police department,
[2:54:54.760 --> 2:54:59.760]  running the jail, running the detention center, and they admit he's a criminal,
[2:54:59.760 --> 2:55:03.760]  and the local boss, August, say, we don't care, he's going to run things.
[2:55:03.760 --> 2:55:08.760]  And it's like this, oh yeah, we're spreading the flu.
[2:55:08.760 --> 2:55:13.760]  And then they're fear-mongering saying it's killing large portions of pregnant women that get it,
[2:55:13.760 --> 2:55:21.760]  but that's out of the sick and impaired women that went to the hospital with H1N1, 25% died.
[2:55:21.760 --> 2:55:26.760]  I mean, this flu is already on track to peak next week.
[2:55:26.760 --> 2:55:31.760]  But that was under the regular gauge now that it's been nasally sprayed into people where it will breed
[2:55:31.760 --> 2:55:37.760]  and then be sneezed back out on you, get ready for it to just spread like wildfire.
[2:55:37.760 --> 2:55:42.760]  And it'll be in plain view and nobody will get in trouble.
[2:55:42.760 --> 2:55:45.760]  Mayo Clinic.
[2:55:45.760 --> 2:55:49.760]  Oh, man, it's it.
[2:55:49.760 --> 2:55:57.760]  I've got to somehow get emotionally divorced from all of this because
[2:55:57.760 --> 2:55:58.760]  it's just too much.
[2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:03.760]  It's too unbelievable that we're this bad, we're this stupid,
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:08.760]  that they're banning neighbors keeping each other's kids,
[2:56:08.760 --> 2:56:12.760]  they're banning farms and ranches that aren't government-controlled,
[2:56:12.760 --> 2:56:15.760]  that they're banning side-of-the-road pumpkin stands,
[2:56:15.760 --> 2:56:19.760]  that they're just, it's just scum, government scum.
[2:56:19.760 --> 2:56:26.760]  And all the worship of government, the PSAs and the ads and the stazies and the citizen spies
[2:56:26.760 --> 2:56:28.760]  and all of it being announced.
[2:56:28.760 --> 2:56:35.760]  Why does this have to happen? Why?
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:39.760]  And they admit all over the country, small-town police are just robbing everyone on the roads,
[2:56:39.760 --> 2:56:42.760]  stealing their wallets, and then they don't even get in trouble.
[2:56:42.760 --> 2:56:49.760]  I mean, it's just, maybe there is something wrong with me.
[2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:51.760]  Maybe this, it's good.
[2:56:51.760 --> 2:56:53.760]  Maybe it's good they're spreading the flu.
[2:56:53.760 --> 2:56:55.760]  Maybe it's good they're putting poison in the water.
[2:56:55.760 --> 2:57:00.760]  Maybe it's good they've gone from one in 25,000 with autism to one in 96.
[2:57:00.760 --> 2:57:06.760]  Maybe it's good they're putting sodium fluoride in the water, which they admit doubles bone cancer.
[2:57:06.760 --> 2:57:07.760]  One of the hundreds of things.
[2:57:07.760 --> 2:57:09.760]  Maybe, maybe dying of bone cancer is good.
[2:57:09.760 --> 2:57:11.760]  Maybe I've been wrong.
[2:57:11.760 --> 2:57:13.760]  I mean, how do these people like it?
[2:57:13.760 --> 2:57:14.760]  How do they think it's funny?
[2:57:14.760 --> 2:57:18.760]  How do I get the way they are and not care anymore?
[2:57:18.760 --> 2:57:23.760]  Maybe, maybe there is something wrong with me that I'm at a hotel after leaving
[2:57:23.760 --> 2:57:26.760]  foreign mercenaries taking over a town.
[2:57:26.760 --> 2:57:30.760]  I go to the building's hotel and there's police and Homeland Security
[2:57:30.760 --> 2:57:32.760]  with little kids training them to be spies.
[2:57:32.760 --> 2:57:35.760]  And maybe I should have just gone, oh, thank you, spies.
[2:57:35.760 --> 2:57:36.760]  It's so American.
[2:57:36.760 --> 2:57:42.760]  Maybe I should have just fallen down on my knees and began worshiping them.
[2:57:42.760 --> 2:57:46.760]  Maybe I should have just, you know, maybe there is something wrong with me.
[2:57:46.760 --> 2:57:53.760]  Maybe I've got something wrong with me that seeing a bunch of kids being trained to spy on their parents is bad.
[2:57:53.760 --> 2:57:56.760]  Maybe, maybe I am the bad person.
[2:57:56.760 --> 2:57:58.760]  I mean, let me ask you guys.
[2:57:58.760 --> 2:58:03.760]  Is it bad that I don't think the state should be training people's kids to spy on their parents?
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:05.760]  Maybe that's good.
[2:58:05.760 --> 2:58:08.760]  Jaren Nyhart, you have any comments?
[2:58:08.760 --> 2:58:12.760]  No, I mean, seriously, maybe we are bad.
[2:58:12.760 --> 2:58:16.760]  Maybe kids spying on their parents trained by the feds is normal.
[2:58:16.760 --> 2:58:18.760]  Maybe Nazi Germany was good.
[2:58:18.760 --> 2:58:20.760]  Maybe Stalinist Russia was good.
[2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:21.760]  Maybe Mao was good.
[2:58:21.760 --> 2:58:26.760]  Maybe we were the bad guys 50, 60 years ago saying that was bad.
[2:58:26.760 --> 2:58:28.760]  Maybe Hitler and Mao were right.
[2:58:28.760 --> 2:58:29.760]  Maybe Lenin was right.
[2:58:29.760 --> 2:58:31.760]  Maybe we are the bad guys.
[2:58:31.760 --> 2:58:35.760]  Maybe George Washington, like FEMA teaches, is bad.
[2:58:35.760 --> 2:58:38.760]  Maybe Thomas Jefferson is bad.
[2:58:38.760 --> 2:58:41.760]  Maybe, maybe the UN's right.
[2:58:41.760 --> 2:58:54.760]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:58:54.760 --> 2:58:58.760]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[2:58:58.760 --> 2:59:03.760]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[2:59:03.760 --> 2:59:07.760]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:59:07.760 --> 2:59:13.760]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[2:59:13.760 --> 2:59:17.760]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:59:17.760 --> 2:59:22.760]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:59:22.760 --> 2:59:25.760]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts,
[2:59:25.760 --> 2:59:28.760]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:59:28.760 --> 2:59:31.760]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[2:59:31.760 --> 2:59:34.760]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science,
[2:59:34.760 --> 2:59:38.760]  go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[2:59:38.760 --> 2:59:45.760]  That's MySolarBackup.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[2:59:45.760 --> 2:59:49.760]  877-327-0365.
[2:59:49.760 --> 3:00:05.760]  Don't wait. Call today.
[3:00:05.760 --> 3:00:20.760]  You know, cutting all the sarcasm. Folks, we're in a lot of trouble. I don't have to tell most of you that.
[3:00:20.760 --> 3:00:27.760]  I don't know what we're going to do. I mean, hardcore classical tyranny is running wild.
[3:00:27.760 --> 3:00:35.760]  And I can't believe how bad it is. I mean, I'm not even looking for this stuff.
[3:00:35.760 --> 3:00:38.760]  And it's staring me in the eye everywhere.
[3:00:38.760 --> 3:00:43.760]  And I know they're putting stuff in the vaccines to give us brain damage and cancer.
[3:00:43.760 --> 3:00:51.760]  And it pisses me off, man. I want to bring these people to justice.
[3:00:51.760 --> 3:00:59.760]  But somehow, we've got to get other people to have a hunger to bring these criminals to justice.
[3:00:59.760 --> 3:01:03.760]  Somehow, we got to reach out to the public.
[3:01:03.760 --> 3:01:07.760]  And I know we're trying, and I know our numbers are growing, but...
[3:01:07.760 --> 3:01:12.760]  Oh, let's just go to your phone calls and I'm going to cover the flu and everything else.
[3:01:12.760 --> 3:01:16.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[3:01:16.760 --> 3:01:19.760]  Oh, who's up next here?
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:22.760]  Janet in Michigan. Thanks for holding her on the air.
[3:01:22.760 --> 3:01:24.760]  Hi there, Alex. How are you?
[3:01:24.760 --> 3:01:26.760]  I'm doing all right.
[3:01:26.760 --> 3:01:31.760]  Well, this is my opinion. With all the shit that I've seen...
[3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:35.760]  Man, we're going to have to let you go, okay? This is a syndicated radio show.
[3:01:35.760 --> 3:01:40.760]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[3:01:40.760 --> 3:01:47.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rachel in Oregon. Rachel, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:01:47.760 --> 3:01:49.760]  Hi, Alex. How are you?
[3:01:49.760 --> 3:01:50.760]  Pretty good.
[3:01:50.760 --> 3:01:55.760]  I'm calling because I was in traffic the other day in downtown Portland.
[3:01:55.760 --> 3:02:03.760]  And I saw a vehicle that had police written on it in big letters, but above it.
[3:02:03.760 --> 3:02:08.760]  And it just passed us in the intersection. It said federal.
[3:02:08.760 --> 3:02:13.760]  And then after it was one word and then below it another.
[3:02:13.760 --> 3:02:19.760]  No, no, they do have federal and what they call national police that are federal showing up everywhere.
[3:02:19.760 --> 3:02:22.760]  I see them all the time here in Austin.
[3:02:22.760 --> 3:02:29.760]  And I mean, think about Obama saying, I want you around school, states won't get their money unless they have 12 months of school.
[3:02:29.760 --> 3:02:33.760]  How did the federal government... These are not independent school districts.
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:40.760]  They're little local whorehouse groups that get federal money that came from the states to begin with to follow their orders.
[3:02:40.760 --> 3:02:43.760]  And it's disgusting.
[3:02:43.760 --> 3:02:49.760]  Now, are these new or are there just something I haven't noticed before?
[3:02:49.760 --> 3:02:54.760]  We first started seeing federal police back in the early 1990s.
[3:02:54.760 --> 3:02:59.760]  But no, under Homeland Security, they're federalizing everything.
[3:02:59.760 --> 3:03:03.760]  Every major department's already been completely federalized.
[3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:07.760]  And they're even putting army liaisons in.
[3:03:07.760 --> 3:03:12.760]  And they're putting them into these threat fusion centers normally run by the Pentagon.
[3:03:12.760 --> 3:03:15.760]  And they every month show the cops a new feature.
[3:03:15.760 --> 3:03:18.760]  Oh, today we're going to show you how to track everybody in real time.
[3:03:18.760 --> 3:03:20.760]  And the cops are just happy to be there.
[3:03:20.760 --> 3:03:22.760]  They're honored members of the department.
[3:03:22.760 --> 3:03:29.760]  And FEMA gets up and says, under an emergency system, we're looking for terrorists or criminals.
[3:03:29.760 --> 3:03:33.760]  You just put in their social security number and all known cell phones registered under their name.
[3:03:33.760 --> 3:03:39.760]  And the telecommunications act come up live. So they put in Alex Jones's social security number and bloop.
[3:03:39.760 --> 3:03:43.760]  There he is right there on this street in South Austin.
[3:03:43.760 --> 3:03:47.760]  And, you know, they just keep introducing the new slave grid.
[3:03:47.760 --> 3:03:50.760]  Oh, now here's a license plate reading system.
[3:03:50.760 --> 3:03:55.760]  Then they tell them if anybody does anything, go ahead and put them in a database.
[3:03:55.760 --> 3:03:59.760]  Put as many Americans as you can in the database.
[3:03:59.760 --> 3:04:05.760]  And they just turned them on a little federal secret police.
[3:04:05.760 --> 3:04:15.760]  And we thought Portland was going to be pretty difficult to get to cost the flu because there's a lot of people here who would probably oppose it.
[3:04:15.760 --> 3:04:18.760]  But it's getting stranger and stranger out here.
[3:04:18.760 --> 3:04:20.760]  It is. God bless you. Good to hear from you.
[3:04:20.760 --> 3:04:26.760]  It is getting insane. It doesn't matter if you're town's liberal, you're town's conservative.
[3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:33.760]  They just come in. Look, most mayors and county commissioners are social climbers and they get taken to the state house.
[3:04:33.760 --> 3:04:40.760]  They get taken to federal meetings. They get flown to meetings and they're told you move up the power structure if you implement this.
[3:04:40.760 --> 3:04:45.760]  And the same global system is being implemented worldwide.
[3:04:45.760 --> 3:04:51.760]  They're making neighbor kids visiting your kids at your house illegal worldwide.
[3:04:51.760 --> 3:04:56.760]  They're making being normal illegal. They're making just living your life illegal.
[3:04:56.760 --> 3:05:02.760]  They're doing it everywhere.
[3:05:02.760 --> 3:05:05.760]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:05:05.760 --> 3:05:10.760]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:05:10.760 --> 3:05:15.760]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:05:15.760 --> 3:05:19.760]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[3:05:19.760 --> 3:05:22.760]  Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[3:05:22.760 --> 3:05:27.760]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[3:05:27.760 --> 3:05:32.760]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:05:32.760 --> 3:05:36.760]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:05:36.760 --> 3:05:42.760]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[3:05:42.760 --> 3:05:45.760]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:05:45.760 --> 3:05:52.760]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633

[3:06:00.760 --> 3:06:06.760]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:06:06.760 --> 3:06:10.760]  Will you continue to be their profit center buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[3:06:10.760 --> 3:06:15.760]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[3:06:15.760 --> 3:06:21.760]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years

[3:06:59.760 --> 3:07:04.760]  Remain in your houses.
[3:07:04.760 --> 3:07:10.760]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11,004.
[3:07:10.760 --> 3:07:14.760]  Will they do it? Will they pull the trigger this time?
[3:07:14.760 --> 3:07:20.760]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[3:07:20.760 --> 3:07:22.760]  Think it can't happen here?
[3:07:22.760 --> 3:07:27.760]  Executive Order 10,990 locks down all highways.
[3:07:27.760 --> 3:07:32.760]  Executive Order 10,995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[3:07:32.760 --> 3:07:37.760]  Executive Order 10,998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[3:07:37.760 --> 3:07:43.760]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[3:07:43.760 --> 3:07:48.760]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it,
[3:07:48.760 --> 3:07:51.760]  go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[3:07:51.760 --> 3:07:54.760]  That's martiallawsurvival.com.
[3:07:54.760 --> 3:07:57.760]  That's martiallawsurvival.com right now.
[3:07:57.760 --> 3:08:00.760]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[3:08:02.760 --> 3:08:05.760]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:08:05.760 --> 3:08:08.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:16.760 --> 3:08:22.760]  Right here in Austin, Texas, they're announcing that you'll be thrown out of school
[3:08:22.760 --> 3:08:29.760]  and then be arrested if you don't take the regular flu shot and then the H1N1.
[3:08:29.760 --> 3:08:40.760]  So really what's happening here is we are seeing a precedent being set
[3:08:40.760 --> 3:08:45.760]  where school children, healthcare workers, you name it, have to take the flu shot.
[3:08:45.760 --> 3:08:50.760]  We're seeing that added to the list of 60-plus vaccines they claim are mandatory.
[3:08:50.760 --> 3:08:56.760]  Now, I remember Governor Rick Perry claimed that the Gardasil shot was mandatory.
[3:08:56.760 --> 3:08:58.760]  Now, that was a lie.
[3:08:58.760 --> 3:09:05.760]  He just put it on the list of health departments, state health department, listed mandatory under policy.
[3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:11.760]  Then public schools lied and would kick you out for truancy saying you'd violated policy
[3:09:11.760 --> 3:09:19.760]  if you hadn't taken it, never telling you there was a waiver they were supposed to give you for the policy under state law.
[3:09:19.760 --> 3:09:26.760]  So even if you're for these shots, it's all fraud driven.
[3:09:26.760 --> 3:09:29.760]  So it says, should healthcare workers be required to get flu shot?
[3:09:29.760 --> 3:09:33.760]  All over the nation they are, all over the nation they're suing.
[3:09:33.760 --> 3:09:35.760]  Before I get to the flu news, I wanted to show you this.
[3:09:35.760 --> 3:09:38.760]  CCTV website recruits video vigilantes.
[3:09:38.760 --> 3:09:42.760]  Governments in the U.S. and England are paying people to spy.
[3:09:42.760 --> 3:09:48.760]  They call it volunteer though, but then they pay you to spy on the surveillance cameras and report to police.
[3:09:48.760 --> 3:09:50.760]  They want you to be involved in it.
[3:09:50.760 --> 3:09:52.760]  Here's the New York Times.
[3:09:52.760 --> 3:09:58.760]  They say license plate scanning readers are spreading all over the city now.
[3:09:58.760 --> 3:10:00.760]  See, the whole country's already got these.
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:02.760]  They're just announcing them to you now.
[3:10:02.760 --> 3:10:03.760]  I wanted to show that to you.
[3:10:03.760 --> 3:10:10.760]  Now, getting back into flu, here is just the regular influenza virus vaccine, one of the big five brands.
[3:10:10.760 --> 3:10:18.760]  And it says contains the Marisol and Mercury derivative as a preservative.
[3:10:18.760 --> 3:10:26.760]  And if you calculate the 25 MCG's, that is roughly five times what it had previously.
[3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:28.760]  So they're on the news saying it's not in there.
[3:10:28.760 --> 3:10:30.760]  It's in all five brands.
[3:10:30.760 --> 3:10:32.760]  And there's even more in the regular one.
[3:10:32.760 --> 3:10:38.760]  And there's even more of the adjuvant squaling in there.
[3:10:38.760 --> 3:10:46.760]  So this much squaling killed large percentages of the troops that were forced to take it with the anthrax and smallpox.
[3:10:46.760 --> 3:10:48.760]  They don't care they're doing it here.
[3:10:48.760 --> 3:10:52.760]  Now, I wanted to get to this.
[3:10:52.760 --> 3:10:54.760]  This is from the nation magazine.
[3:10:54.760 --> 3:10:56.760]  Human vaccine test put off again.
[3:10:56.760 --> 3:11:00.760]  They are not doing an H1N1 test.
[3:11:00.760 --> 3:11:07.760]  This is an unapproved, but under level six U.N. emergency, they are going to market today.
[3:11:07.760 --> 3:11:09.760]  With the first 200,000.
[3:11:09.760 --> 3:11:11.760]  First, they said they didn't have 200 million shots.
[3:11:11.760 --> 3:11:17.760]  They announced today, the feds did, that they have 200 million ready.
[3:11:17.760 --> 3:11:24.760]  200 million or two thirds of the 300 million population in this country with another 100 million being made.
[3:11:24.760 --> 3:11:27.760]  They're acting like police are guarding it when it's delivered.
[3:11:27.760 --> 3:11:28.760]  Everyone wants it.
[3:11:28.760 --> 3:11:29.760]  There's long lines.
[3:11:29.760 --> 3:11:33.760]  Yeah, a hypochondriac idiots who want to get it.
[3:11:33.760 --> 3:11:40.760]  They're hyping up of 100 women who had the H1N1 who went to the hospital of the sickest who already went.
[3:11:40.760 --> 3:11:43.760]  23 died or one fifth.
[3:11:43.760 --> 3:11:51.760]  They don't tell you when you read deeper that they all had preexisting conditions or that it's killing much less than the regular flu.
[3:11:51.760 --> 3:11:53.760]  But here's what's scary.
[3:11:53.760 --> 3:11:55.760]  They haven't tested it.
[3:11:55.760 --> 3:12:10.760]  But they're rolling out with the first 10 million dosages starting today with a live virus.
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:12.760]  And I saw this on Fox this morning.
[3:12:12.760 --> 3:12:19.760]  I mean, I already knew this, but to see them admit, oh, yes, it's live and it may give some people the flu, but that's okay.
[3:12:19.760 --> 3:12:27.760]  And so they spread their nasal passage, the virus grows in the sinus and then they sneeze it on you.
[3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:33.760]  And so the hospitals will now and the police departments will now become giant incubation centers.
[3:12:33.760 --> 3:12:36.760]  And it's a religion to these cops to do what they're told.
[3:12:36.760 --> 3:12:38.760]  So they're going to go, oh, I love it.
[3:12:38.760 --> 3:12:39.760]  I love the government.
[3:12:39.760 --> 3:12:44.760]  And let me tell you guys doing this are out of your minds and some of you will undoubtedly have adverse reactions or die.
[3:12:44.760 --> 3:12:47.760]  By the way, don't believe me on that front.
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:54.760]  Here is the Mayo Clinic, one of the most respected virology centers in the country.
[3:12:54.760 --> 3:12:58.760]  Influenza virus vaccine live.
[3:12:58.760 --> 3:13:03.760]  I'm reading from the headline nasal route.
[3:13:03.760 --> 3:13:11.760]  Not the inner muscular or the echo dermis or the different ways they deliver it under the skin or into the muscle.
[3:13:11.760 --> 3:13:16.760]  No, this is the nasal route in the snow.
[3:13:16.760 --> 3:13:21.760]  Influenza virus vaccine live nasal route.
[3:13:21.760 --> 3:13:25.760]  And this is a live H1N1.
[3:13:25.760 --> 3:13:33.760]  And this is that all five of these companies patented and cloned this exact DNA sequence RNA sequence.
[3:13:33.760 --> 3:13:37.760]  Excuse me in 2007 and got patents.
[3:13:37.760 --> 3:13:42.760]  And that's why they said, oh, we'll have this in a few months, not six months to a year like normal because we already had it.
[3:13:42.760 --> 3:13:51.760]  Then they admit in last year's vaccine program, they had virus simulants and then you go look at what that means or virus track.
[3:13:51.760 --> 3:13:52.760]  It means live virus.
[3:13:52.760 --> 3:13:55.760]  They put this crap out in the other hemisphere.
[3:13:55.760 --> 3:13:57.760]  That's where this all came from.
[3:13:57.760 --> 3:14:01.760]  That's why top virologists have said, yeah, we've looked at this under electron microscopes.
[3:14:01.760 --> 3:14:03.760]  This was clearly made in the lab.
[3:14:03.760 --> 3:14:07.760]  Now, do they know something we don't know?
[3:14:07.760 --> 3:14:17.760]  Is this going to mutate now because they said that if the nasal was live, it would be mega deadly because that's where it's guaranteed in millions of people to mutate.
[3:14:17.760 --> 3:14:22.760]  And it's probably going to mutate into a bad form because you'll have hundreds of different mutations.
[3:14:22.760 --> 3:14:27.760]  And then the very same bastards will just sit up there and go, we don't know why everybody's starting to die.
[3:14:27.760 --> 3:14:29.760]  Take your shots.
[3:14:29.760 --> 3:14:31.760]  We told you so.
[3:14:31.760 --> 3:14:34.760]  I mean, is that what we're about to see happen?
[3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:37.760]  There's no end to you criminals.
[3:14:37.760 --> 3:14:40.760]  There's no end to you people.
[3:14:40.760 --> 3:14:47.760]  And they go on to list the hundreds of medical conditions and the hundreds of drugs that if you're on them, don't take it.
[3:14:47.760 --> 3:14:52.760]  But I'll guarantee you at your local pediatrician clinic, they're mainly giving this to kids.
[3:14:52.760 --> 3:14:56.760]  They don't tell you it says in here, don't give it to little kids.
[3:14:56.760 --> 3:15:00.760]  I'll guarantee it because they're, look at this.
[3:15:00.760 --> 3:15:04.760]  And by the way, Burmese is doing great research. He keeps handing me articles.
[3:15:04.760 --> 3:15:09.760]  I want him to give this all to Paul Watson and Kurt to post in our developing flu section.
[3:15:09.760 --> 3:15:13.760]  This where you can go read it for yourself in deciding to use the vaccine.
[3:15:13.760 --> 3:15:16.760]  The risk of taking a vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do.
[3:15:16.760 --> 3:15:19.760]  Wait, I thought Reuters said there's no bad any of these can do.
[3:15:19.760 --> 3:15:21.760]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[3:15:21.760 --> 3:15:25.760]  The CDC secret documents don't say it causes neurological disorders.
[3:15:25.760 --> 3:15:30.760]  Of course, they do say that, but I heard Dr. Dina Dell Sunday on the radio saying it's a conspiracy.
[3:15:30.760 --> 3:15:36.760]  It will hurt no one. It's impossible. It will only help you.
[3:15:36.760 --> 3:15:38.760]  Total lie.
[3:15:38.760 --> 3:15:42.760]  I mean, here's the Mayo Clinic in deciding to use a vaccine.
[3:15:42.760 --> 3:15:46.760]  The risk of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do.
[3:15:46.760 --> 3:15:48.760]  By the way, that's on the flu inserts.
[3:15:48.760 --> 3:15:51.760]  The flu inserts admit this can sterilize you.
[3:15:51.760 --> 3:15:53.760]  This has been associated with infertility.
[3:15:53.760 --> 3:15:56.760]  This has been associated with cancer.
[3:15:56.760 --> 3:15:58.760]  Yeah, you start shooting.
[3:15:58.760 --> 3:16:03.760]  So you're meant to get a tiny bit of flu and then get immunity to it.
[3:16:03.760 --> 3:16:05.760]  Maybe a few viruses go into your nose.
[3:16:05.760 --> 3:16:12.760]  They say it might take 45, 50 viruses and one drop of the water to then replicate and for you to catch it.
[3:16:12.760 --> 3:16:19.760]  But instead, when they put millions of live viruses up your nose and set a 25 or 50 on average,
[3:16:19.760 --> 3:16:27.760]  your body doesn't know what to do and it has a storm of autoimmune response.
[3:16:27.760 --> 3:16:29.760]  And that's just one problem.
[3:16:29.760 --> 3:16:31.760]  And you do that over and over again.
[3:16:31.760 --> 3:16:37.760]  Your body just gives up after a while and you get cancer because your body just gives up.
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:39.760]  You burn out your autoimmune system.
[3:16:39.760 --> 3:16:45.760]  It's like post-traumatic stress disorder where you put troops in front line battle for two, three, four tours.
[3:16:45.760 --> 3:16:49.760]  Their adrenal glands are fried, their brain is fried, their basket cases.
[3:16:49.760 --> 3:16:55.760]  They're only happy when they're in a bar fight or killing somebody because that's the only time they feel alive.
[3:16:55.760 --> 3:17:01.760]  Executives and business people and performers have their own form of post-traumatic stress.
[3:17:01.760 --> 3:17:04.760]  They're low energy when they're not on the stage.
[3:17:04.760 --> 3:17:05.760]  I've experienced this.
[3:17:05.760 --> 3:17:09.760]  You go do four hours of high intensity radio, you get tired.
[3:17:09.760 --> 3:17:12.760]  It's hundreds of times worse when you're in combat, I've been told.
[3:17:12.760 --> 3:17:18.760]  The intensity of it or being a cop who sees a lot of really bad stuff.
[3:17:18.760 --> 3:17:20.760]  That's why it screws them up.
[3:17:20.760 --> 3:17:23.760]  It's the same thing with that's your brain.
[3:17:23.760 --> 3:17:31.760]  Imagine your endocrine system being pumped full of all these shots that jack it up, jack it up, jack it up, jack it up.
[3:17:31.760 --> 3:17:37.760]  You're meant to get 25 to 50 viruses in you and get an autoimmunity to those.
[3:17:37.760 --> 3:17:44.760]  You're attacked by a few troops, not a million.
[3:17:44.760 --> 3:17:47.760]  That's why autoimmune diseases, cancer, brain damage.
[3:17:47.760 --> 3:17:53.760]  And we have scientist after scientist, top scientist like Dr. Blalock.
[3:17:53.760 --> 3:17:56.760]  This guy invented a whole bunch of famous brain surgeries.
[3:17:56.760 --> 3:18:01.760]  His term, excitotoxicity, is now in major medical literature and been proven.
[3:18:01.760 --> 3:18:03.760]  He wrote about it 25 years ago.
[3:18:03.760 --> 3:18:06.760]  He coined dozens and dozens of terms.
[3:18:06.760 --> 3:18:08.760]  They all know.
[3:18:08.760 --> 3:18:12.760]  All the brain scientists know what's going on.
[3:18:12.760 --> 3:18:15.760]  MSG, hardcore drug.
[3:18:15.760 --> 3:18:17.760]  Aspartame, hardcore drug.
[3:18:17.760 --> 3:18:18.760]  Do you know what aspartame is?
[3:18:18.760 --> 3:18:20.760]  It's a genetic engineer product.
[3:18:20.760 --> 3:18:27.760]  The army wanted to feed toxic waste of bacteria and have bacteria be able to eat it in an oil spill test.
[3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:29.760]  Then they found a chemical weapon.
[3:18:29.760 --> 3:18:31.760]  Then they decided to put it in your drinks.
[3:18:31.760 --> 3:18:33.760]  Then in 9,000 foods, it's called aspartame.
[3:18:33.760 --> 3:18:41.760]  It is the defecation of a specially engineered type of bacteria, an E. coli.
[3:18:41.760 --> 3:18:42.760]  Don't believe me?
[3:18:42.760 --> 3:18:43.760]  Go pull it up for yourself.
[3:18:43.760 --> 3:18:47.760]  Manufacturing process of that, of aspartame.
[3:18:47.760 --> 3:18:49.760]  You can read it for yourself.
[3:18:49.760 --> 3:18:53.760]  You'll be on university websites.
[3:18:53.760 --> 3:18:55.760]  They feed you bacteria feces.
[3:18:55.760 --> 3:18:57.760]  You eat it with pleasure.
[3:18:57.760 --> 3:18:59.760]  They inject you with mercury.
[3:18:59.760 --> 3:19:01.760]  You worship your brain damaged children.
[3:19:01.760 --> 3:19:03.760]  Everyone makes it in a little nitty fest.
[3:19:03.760 --> 3:19:05.760]  Look at their brain damage.
[3:19:05.760 --> 3:19:07.760]  More shots, more shots.
[3:19:07.760 --> 3:19:09.760]  It's all just sick fun.
[3:19:09.760 --> 3:19:11.760]  It's all just sickening.
[3:19:11.760 --> 3:19:15.760]  Sickening everybody dying of AIDS and cancer.
[3:19:15.760 --> 3:19:19.760]  Just sickening and getting into it and going to banquets together.
[3:19:19.760 --> 3:19:22.760]  Whining about it and never finding out what's doing it.
[3:19:22.760 --> 3:19:25.760]  Then it just goes on as they pump live virus in.
[3:19:25.760 --> 3:19:27.760]  They list hundreds of drugs.
[3:19:27.760 --> 3:19:31.760]  I mean, just page after page, if you've got this illness, if you've got that illness,
[3:19:31.760 --> 3:19:35.760]  if you're allergic to eggs, if you're allergic to bee stings, if you're...
[3:19:35.760 --> 3:19:38.760]  I told you, because if you're already allergic to stuff, you sure...
[3:19:38.760 --> 3:19:44.760]  If you can't take a little bee putting maybe one thousandth of a toxic chemical into you
[3:19:44.760 --> 3:19:50.760]  that what a shot does, you sure can't take a shot.
[3:19:50.760 --> 3:19:55.760]  Grown on a bunch of rotten dead babies or rotten dead monkey guts
[3:19:55.760 --> 3:19:58.760]  or caterpillar eggs.
[3:19:58.760 --> 3:20:27.760]  Of course the vaccines are causing all the allergies.
[3:20:28.760 --> 3:20:32.760]  The Slaughter to the Slaughter, sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery
[3:20:32.760 --> 3:20:35.760]  that are being placed on America is not an option.
[3:20:35.760 --> 3:20:38.760]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[3:20:38.760 --> 3:20:42.760]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market
[3:20:42.760 --> 3:20:46.760]  and numerous other high quality health supplements.

[3:21:01.760 --> 3:21:07.760]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground Sierra,
[3:21:07.760 --> 3:21:10.760]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:21:10.760 --> 3:21:17.760]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:21:17.760 --> 3:21:26.760]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:21:26.760 --> 3:21:33.760]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:21:33.760 --> 3:21:36.760]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:21:36.760 --> 3:21:42.760]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:21:42.760 --> 3:21:49.760]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[3:21:49.760 --> 3:21:54.760]  and aggressively spread it worldwide, or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:21:54.760 --> 3:22:00.760]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:22:00.760 --> 3:22:02.760]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[3:22:02.760 --> 3:22:07.760]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[3:22:07.760 --> 3:22:15.760]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[3:22:15.760 --> 3:22:21.760]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[3:22:21.760 --> 3:22:28.760]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[3:22:28.760 --> 3:22:33.760]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[3:22:33.760 --> 3:22:38.760]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[3:22:38.760 --> 3:22:46.760]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[3:22:46.760 --> 3:22:53.760]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[3:22:53.760 --> 3:23:00.760]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:23:00.760 --> 3:23:05.760]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[3:23:05.760 --> 3:23:09.760]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[3:23:09.760 --> 3:23:15.760]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[3:23:15.760 --> 3:23:22.760]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant. There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[3:23:22.760 --> 3:23:25.760]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[3:23:25.760 --> 3:23:33.760]  You can find out all about it and order it online at nogerms.info. That's nogerms.info.
[3:23:33.760 --> 3:23:38.760]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well.
[3:23:38.760 --> 3:23:48.760]  When they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid, don't pick your nose, don't shake hands, and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[3:23:48.760 --> 3:23:57.760]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners. Go to nogerms.info. That's nogerms.info.
[3:23:57.760 --> 3:24:00.760]  Be well and stay well. Best MZ.
[3:24:02.760 --> 3:24:11.760]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show. Because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:24:11.760 --> 3:24:18.760]  You know, I'm going to be honest with listeners. I got so focused on this hardened thing that I dropped the ball on the flu.
[3:24:18.760 --> 3:24:24.760]  It's shaping up to be more outrageous and worse than I had originally thought.
[3:24:24.760 --> 3:24:29.760]  And we're going to be covering this with a lot of informative guests this week and next week.
[3:24:29.760 --> 3:24:35.760]  Go ahead and bring it in to me, Bermas. I couldn't find my article about them kicking people out of school here in Austin if they don't take the shot.
[3:24:35.760 --> 3:24:44.760]  Yeah, Austin. Immunization requirements. Yeah, yeah, this is AISD saying you must take all the flu shots or you can't go to school and they're never telling you there's a waiver.
[3:24:44.760 --> 3:24:53.760]  Just absolute criminals. But no, I mean, I want the actual news articles that talk about it too, though. So thank you.
[3:24:53.760 --> 3:24:57.760]  It's here somewhere in my stack. But let me go over this right now.
[3:24:57.760 --> 3:25:05.760]  Look at this article out of Eyewitness 12 CBS News. This is out of Kansas.
[3:25:05.760 --> 3:25:11.760]  Volunteers should be prepared to sign a confidentiality agreement and stand for long periods.
[3:25:11.760 --> 3:25:15.760]  So they're saying that they're about to start giving people the H1N1.
[3:25:15.760 --> 3:25:22.760]  They don't tell you that they already stuck it in the new regular seasonal flu. It says it on the insert.
[3:25:22.760 --> 3:25:32.760]  They're already trying to spread it that way or that the 10 million dosages of the nasal spray is a live virus that will spread it.
[3:25:32.760 --> 3:25:41.760]  But they're so confident in this not hurting you that they make you sign a confidentiality agreement, waving liability, and that you won't talk about it.
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:25:45.760]  Obviously, they're not confident. Now, let me finish up with the Mayo Clinic.
[3:25:45.760 --> 3:25:57.760]  This is the Mayo Clinic influenza virus vaccine live nasal route. This is the one 10 million people start taking today that is live and breeds in the sinus.
[3:25:57.760 --> 3:26:04.760]  And then they sneeze it all over you and your family. And it's going to mutate, guaranteed, and kill a bunch more people.
[3:26:04.760 --> 3:26:10.760]  And they love it because they know the stupid public doesn't understand urology.
[3:26:10.760 --> 3:26:15.760]  I'm getting so sick of the government and so sick of the filth and so sick of the son of a bitch.
[3:26:15.760 --> 3:26:21.760]  White House Science are who writes 1100 page books about who wants to kill us with crap in the vaccines.
[3:26:21.760 --> 3:26:27.760]  Ecoscience. I mean, can't you listen to the psychos when they tell you what they're doing to you?
[3:26:27.760 --> 3:26:30.760]  Is there nothing you won't believe out there?
[3:26:30.760 --> 3:26:34.760]  Now, this is the Mayo Clinic. You'll never see this on the news.
[3:26:34.760 --> 3:26:40.760]  This is what's with the vaccine inserts. It says it's got mercury in it.
[3:26:40.760 --> 3:26:46.760]  It says it's got other stuff. It says that it also is connected to Gillian beret.
[3:26:46.760 --> 3:26:53.760]  In fact, I just had a highlighted copy. I was running around within the office.
[3:26:53.760 --> 3:27:02.760]  And it goes through all the things it does other interactions, other medical problems.
[3:27:02.760 --> 3:27:05.760]  Allergic reaction to anybody who has allergies.
[3:27:05.760 --> 3:27:08.760]  It can make your brain swell up and kill you dead in a hammer.
[3:27:08.760 --> 3:27:11.760]  The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this vaccine.
[3:27:11.760 --> 3:27:15.760]  Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any of the following medical problems.
[3:27:15.760 --> 3:27:19.760]  Allergic reaction of a history to eggs or egg products.
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:28.760]  Gentamocyan or gelatin or any amino acid should not use these conditions.
[3:27:28.760 --> 3:27:32.760]  Asthma, severe wheezing. Everybody knows that's why everybody's getting the breathing problems.
[3:27:32.760 --> 3:27:35.760]  It causes an autoimmune response in the bronchia.
[3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:39.760]  Where's the Gillian beret's part in here?
[3:27:39.760 --> 3:27:43.760]  I just had a highlighted. Ask Burma to highlight that part for me because I saw his highlighted copy.
[3:27:43.760 --> 3:27:45.760]  Thank you.
[3:27:45.760 --> 3:27:48.760]  So all of that is going on.
[3:27:48.760 --> 3:27:51.760]  And then they admit it's not even tested.
[3:27:51.760 --> 3:27:57.760]  And then they make you sign a form that you won't sue and that you waive liability if you take it.
[3:27:57.760 --> 3:28:03.760]  Well, meanwhile, saying, oh, it's a conspiracy theory if you think this can hurt anybody.
[3:28:03.760 --> 3:28:06.760]  And trying to make school kids take it.
[3:28:06.760 --> 3:28:10.760]  And it goes on and on and on.
[3:28:10.760 --> 3:28:15.760]  Meanwhile, on the economic front, U.S. economic decline forges New World Order.
[3:28:15.760 --> 3:28:17.760]  Hip hip hooray.
[3:28:17.760 --> 3:28:24.760]  We're going to be going over that coming up.
[3:28:24.760 --> 3:28:27.760]  And they now list here that you must attend.
[3:28:27.760 --> 3:28:35.760]  You must be have all your vaccinations to attend schools and a color of law site chapter three eight one zero zero one.
[3:28:35.760 --> 3:28:39.760]  Never telling you it says there's a waiver to the policy.
[3:28:39.760 --> 3:28:43.760]  And they say every child must be.
[3:28:43.760 --> 3:28:49.760]  Given the vaccines, including both flu shots.
[3:28:49.760 --> 3:28:54.760]  But that's how they roll.
[3:28:54.760 --> 3:28:58.760]  That's how they operate.
[3:28:58.760 --> 3:29:11.760]  And there are lawsuits being filed by military people and by nursing associations saying they don't want to take the shots.
[3:29:11.760 --> 3:29:14.760]  They're medical workers in a free society.
[3:29:14.760 --> 3:29:19.760]  You don't have to take it, but then the establishment says, well, if you haven't taken it, you could spread it to other people.
[3:29:19.760 --> 3:29:25.760]  Wait, if all the morons have had the shot and it supposedly protects them, why would we be then bad?
[3:29:25.760 --> 3:29:35.760]  No, no, it's our bodies, our lives, the history of human experimentation, the history of the government killing people through different medical tests and experiments.
[3:29:35.760 --> 3:29:40.760]  The history of Bayer and what they've put in vaccines and all the deaths from vaccines.
[3:29:40.760 --> 3:29:42.760]  No.
[3:29:42.760 --> 3:29:45.760]  If you were completely trustworthy, we shouldn't be made to take it.
[3:29:45.760 --> 3:29:48.760]  But you're a pack of murdering scum.
[3:29:48.760 --> 3:29:52.760]  But the public just can't believe it's happening to them.
[3:29:52.760 --> 3:29:56.760]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[3:29:56.760 --> 3:30:01.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:01.760 --> 3:30:05.760]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:30:05.760 --> 3:30:07.760]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:30:07.760 --> 3:30:16.760]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:30:16.760 --> 3:30:21.760]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[3:30:21.760 --> 3:30:23.760]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[3:30:23.760 --> 3:30:30.760]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.

[3:31:05.760 --> 3:31:11.760]  It's year after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, mighty film Terror Storm is complete.
[3:31:11.760 --> 3:31:19.760]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[3:31:19.760 --> 3:31:26.760]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[3:31:26.760 --> 3:31:38.760]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[3:31:38.760 --> 3:31:44.760]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[3:31:44.760 --> 3:31:49.760]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[3:33:19.760 --> 3:33:37.760]  I found it here on page 5 of the Mayo Clinic, and it says that the may cause asthma, severe wheezing, may make conditions worse if you take the flu vaccine.
[3:33:37.760 --> 3:33:56.760]  Also, Guillain-Barre syndrome, history of may cause the symptoms of this condition to return. It'll make immune deficiency worse, cancer worse, human immunodeficiency, HIV worse, leukemia, lymphoma.
[3:33:56.760 --> 3:34:02.760]  Hey, you like all these things? I mean, vaccines, folks, if you just read the inserts, but see, they think you're idiots.
[3:34:02.760 --> 3:34:11.760]  They have little vaccine guys and white lab coats up on TV. Go. It's wonderful. No one's ever been hurt by a vaccine lying.
[3:34:11.760 --> 3:34:13.760]  And then here it is, Dallas Morning News.
[3:34:13.760 --> 3:34:17.760]  Districts get tough on immunizations. We'll turn away some.
[3:34:17.760 --> 3:34:25.760]  Then I saw an article in the statesman going, kids are submitting 90 plus percent of taking their shots. You will be arrested if you don't.
[3:34:25.760 --> 3:34:33.760]  Total lies. You'll be arrested for truancy because they will falsely kick you out of the government camp.
[3:34:33.760 --> 3:34:40.760]  Here's another one. H1N1 flu vaccinations could be here by end of the week, Austin Daily Herald.
[3:34:40.760 --> 3:34:44.760]  They're making the regular flu shot mandatory, but it's not mandatory.
[3:34:44.760 --> 3:34:48.760]  By the way, somewhere in my stack, I'm going to try to dig it out. I covered it yesterday some.
[3:34:48.760 --> 3:34:58.760]  They have mainstream British news with one of the inventors of the vaccine saying it doesn't protect you from cervical cancer and it can actually kill you.
[3:34:58.760 --> 3:35:07.760]  And you shouldn't take it morally coming out against it. You'll never hear that on our news.
[3:35:07.760 --> 3:35:12.760]  They'll just have liars like Dr. Dina Dell will get up and tell you what's wonderful and good for you.
[3:35:12.760 --> 3:35:19.760]  I want to get into some financial news then back into your calls and more on the economic stimulus package.
[3:35:19.760 --> 3:35:24.760]  They're admitting the White House had their pundits on CNN and MSNBC.
[3:35:24.760 --> 3:35:32.760]  I was watching this morning going, well, we know it's unpopular to call it stimulus too because we've already taken trillions, but 400 billion has been paid back.
[3:35:32.760 --> 3:35:40.760]  No, they give trillions to the banks. They then loan the money back to the U.S. at interest.
[3:35:40.760 --> 3:35:45.760]  I mean, that's how the scam works. And then in some cases they pay the money back.
[3:35:45.760 --> 3:35:51.760]  It's in the tens of trillions, not 700 billion. I've had congressmen on tape asking Bernanke.
[3:35:51.760 --> 3:35:59.760]  So you've, so you've loaned out the 700 billion over 30 times and Bernanke's like, yes, but none of your business where it goes.
[3:35:59.760 --> 3:36:05.760]  They call that 700 billion the way it was written is a revolving credit line.
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:15.760]  So they just keep stealing it. And then they, through the banking, leverage it 10 times and then leverage it again and leverage it again and leverage it again.
[3:36:15.760 --> 3:36:24.760]  Just like when the government launderers $30,000 for a kilo of cocaine, they then leverage it at least 10 times out.
[3:36:24.760 --> 3:36:28.760]  You understand how banking works, folks? It's just diabolical.
[3:36:28.760 --> 3:36:34.760]  And then you've got them all over the news bragging, oh, the new world order is here. Oh, it's so wonderful.
[3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:39.760]  Here's agency French press, U.S. economic decline for just new world order.
[3:36:39.760 --> 3:36:44.760]  Oh, the carbon footprint of the U.S. is lowering as they go into depression.
[3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:53.760]  Oh, the new economy means you don't have a job. Oh, but we have a great economy. It's a jobless economy.
[3:36:53.760 --> 3:36:58.760]  I couldn't believe it two years ago when they said they were going to kill the dollar and set up a new SDR.
[3:36:58.760 --> 3:37:02.760]  You'll still have a dollar. It just won't be the World Reserve currency. That means it's dead.
[3:37:02.760 --> 3:37:10.760]  You'll have regional currencies that are all randomly set every morning by the central banks to whatever the insider trading gives them the biggest profits.
[3:37:10.760 --> 3:37:21.760]  The private banks that engineered the Ponzi scheme are now bankrupting the planet with an even bigger Ponzi scheme and giving themselves godlike power.
[3:37:21.760 --> 3:37:30.760]  But why not if a convicted 14-time con artist swindler mercenary from Serbia can come in and take over a giant prison in southern Montana
[3:37:30.760 --> 3:37:36.760]  and then even after it comes out, the city fathers say we love him. We love felons literally to my face.
[3:37:36.760 --> 3:37:43.760]  We don't care if he's a criminal. He can run things and we're going to lock the town up and make money off of it.
[3:37:43.760 --> 3:37:51.760]  Why not have foreign offshore banks raping us and setting up carbon taxes?
[3:37:51.760 --> 3:37:56.760]  It makes my head spin.
[3:37:56.760 --> 3:38:08.760]  I mean, we've got to get angry and say no to all of this, but instead corrupt government people from Hardin, Montana to Austin, Texas to big cities like New York City to beyond, they're bought and paid for.
[3:38:08.760 --> 3:38:20.760]  That's why they're passing laws in Texas and in California and in Michigan saying you can't even have two neighbor kids over for breakfast or to even stand under your doorway in the snow.
[3:38:20.760 --> 3:38:27.760]  Even if the parents of the neighbors say yes, waiting for the bus, we're going to take your kids CPS.
[3:38:27.760 --> 3:38:34.760]  You can't sell eggs on the street corner. You can't have a garage sale. You can't do anything because you are a prisoner.
[3:38:34.760 --> 3:38:39.760]  Folks, America is now becoming a giant prison. They're openly announcing they're going to shut down the old web.
[3:38:39.760 --> 3:38:45.760]  They've openly handed over U.S. control of the U.N. of the Internet. I've got those headlines up.
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:38:53.760]  In fact, Google the term U.S. hands over control of Internet and it's positive articles. Oh, wonderful. No, it's not wonderful.
[3:38:53.760 --> 3:38:59.760]  Now it's a total private corporation doing whatever it wants that was built with our tax money.
[3:38:59.760 --> 3:39:04.760]  The serving system, the domain system, not the physical grid.
[3:39:04.760 --> 3:39:12.760]  Obama openly announces he's taking over the Internet for your quote safety.
[3:39:12.760 --> 3:39:17.760]  But now they're openly saying they're beginning the phase out of the dollar. The world is moving out of dollars.
[3:39:17.760 --> 3:39:24.760]  They're not buying as much dollars. No wonder gold is up above $1,017.
[3:39:24.760 --> 3:39:35.760]  When it dropped down to 990 something, Ted bought a bunch of it and he can sell it to you $20, $30 in the market under what it is now.
[3:39:35.760 --> 3:39:40.760]  Now, a month ago, he was selling it to you at 900 bucks an ounce. You didn't want it then.
[3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:46.760]  No, it's over a thousand. Do you want it at 900 and something?
[3:39:46.760 --> 3:39:59.760]  I wanted to bring Ted up. Ted, what is it like for you to see open North American Union being announced, to see open world government, to hear openly that they're killing the dollar, to just see all this happening?
[3:39:59.760 --> 3:40:10.760]  Well, it's a saddening thing, especially considering the fact that I have children and now my step-grandchild is going to have to live through this.
[3:40:10.760 --> 3:40:16.760]  It gives me such a sickening feeling in my gut.
[3:40:16.760 --> 3:40:25.760]  But then I'm watching it right here. I mean, what do we have? We had 200 banks that had failed already this year that are on the books, at least another 100 more before the year is over.
[3:40:25.760 --> 3:40:30.760]  We just have a complete collapse of the United States dollar and its value.
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:39.760]  I mean, right now the dollar is down again. It's at 76.64. I mean, there just is not a lot of bright light on the horizon.
[3:40:39.760 --> 3:40:45.760]  And with this economic system that we have, we have to take on more debt in order to bail out our problems.
[3:40:45.760 --> 3:40:49.760]  How is that ever going to help us? It just cannot help us.
[3:40:49.760 --> 3:41:03.760]  And Ted, the entire economy, the numbers came out as you know last week, manufacturing, even light manufacturing, dead, they allow putting a hamburger together to be listed as manufacturing.
[3:41:03.760 --> 3:41:09.760]  I mean, I know putting videos in bags and shipping them to people is a manufacturing credit we've got here.
[3:41:09.760 --> 3:41:16.760]  Putting hamburgers together is a manufacturing credit, and that's even down.
[3:41:16.760 --> 3:41:22.760]  245,000 people lost their job this month. I mean, more and more and more.
[3:41:22.760 --> 3:41:27.760]  And they say, oh, the new recovery means the foreign banks get rich and you're homeless.
[3:41:27.760 --> 3:41:33.760]  What you're saying is that the Federal Reserve system is bailing out their friends.
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:37.760]  They're moving the money into the accounts and they're moving away as the banks become examined.
[3:41:37.760 --> 3:41:39.760]  I mean, it's just ridiculous what they're doing.
[3:41:39.760 --> 3:41:49.760]  If you're not part of the good old boy club, your bank gets shut down. Unemployment numbers that the government's reporting now is up to 9.8% up from 9.6.
[3:41:49.760 --> 3:41:57.760]  That's right. I had some drunk pro war guy in Montana tell me that the government had saved the banks and had taken all banks over.
[3:41:57.760 --> 3:42:09.760]  The big regulators from JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and others on record go and shut down healthy banks and insurance companies and feed them into their mouth.
[3:42:09.760 --> 3:42:12.760]  The zombie banks are taking over the country.
[3:42:12.760 --> 3:42:17.760]  That's right. And we're getting a bigger and more wide complex.
[3:42:17.760 --> 3:42:23.760]  This military industrial complex that you always hear about is becoming bigger and more powerful.
[3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:28.760]  Why do you think the President of the United States wants to give the Federal Reserve system more power?
[3:42:28.760 --> 3:42:31.760]  It's because he's being directed to do so.
[3:42:31.760 --> 3:42:36.760]  And that is going to destroy the value of our dollar. It's going to destroy our economy.
[3:42:36.760 --> 3:42:38.760]  It's going to just absolutely...
[3:42:38.760 --> 3:42:47.760]  Exactly, Ted. And while the average person is busy loving Obama or hating Obama, he doesn't matter. He's a puppet. He's a nobody.
[3:42:47.760 --> 3:42:54.760]  That's the point, Alex. Obama is not any different than George Bush. I mean, we have more war than we had when he came in.
[3:42:54.760 --> 3:42:58.760]  He said he was going to end the wars. I mean, look at all the different things that he promised.
[3:42:58.760 --> 3:43:00.760]  The whole thing is a house of cards.
[3:43:00.760 --> 3:43:08.760]  These people that are put into the President's office are just puppets to this military industrial complex that I'm referring to.
[3:43:08.760 --> 3:43:16.760]  It's not like the person that we have elected as an official to represent us has really any say so in the first place.
[3:43:16.760 --> 3:43:24.760]  But he serves as a distraction. They can build him up and make a big media spectacle out of it and then destroy him.
[3:43:24.760 --> 3:43:29.760]  And I watched CNN. Every report is about Latinos being discriminated against or blacks.
[3:43:29.760 --> 3:43:34.760]  Everything is about bulkination and division. And it's so disgusting.
[3:43:34.760 --> 3:43:38.760]  Bottom line, folks, you need to get into silver and gold.
[3:43:38.760 --> 3:43:42.760]  Ted, briefly. Silver's way up. Gold's way up today.
[3:43:42.760 --> 3:43:52.760]  Tell people where it's at in the market. We'll put the graph up on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers versus Ted when you bought in.
[3:43:52.760 --> 3:43:56.760]  So the type of savings in the market that you're factoring in.
[3:43:56.760 --> 3:44:03.760]  Well, you know, I got to say that I really like the Federal Reserve system and the central banks when they beat up the gold prices.
[3:44:03.760 --> 3:44:10.760]  And I was able to pop in there at about that high 988 level to 994.
[3:44:10.760 --> 3:44:16.760]  And now gold is up again to $1,018.70.
[3:44:16.760 --> 3:44:19.760]  So obviously the market is moving in my direction again.
[3:44:19.760 --> 3:44:31.760]  You can just see it. It just makes it simple for people like me to be able to buy in every time they start pushing the market place down because you can just count on the fact that it's going to bounce back up again.
[3:44:31.760 --> 3:44:38.760]  So right now you're looking at gold about 20 to $25 less than what it's currently trading for at this particular time,
[3:44:38.760 --> 3:44:43.760]  which equals rather than $236 for Frank right now.
[3:44:43.760 --> 3:44:45.760]  I've got him at $233.
[3:44:45.760 --> 3:44:49.760]  I have the British sovereigns currently right now at $288.
[3:44:49.760 --> 3:44:54.760]  And I've been talking about those walking Liberty halves every time that Silver takes a dip.
[3:44:54.760 --> 3:44:58.760]  I'm able to grab those. They're currently right now at $869.
[3:44:58.760 --> 3:45:01.760]  And I also like the $10 Liberty.
[3:45:01.760 --> 3:45:03.760]  It's a great coin to be getting into.
[3:45:03.760 --> 3:45:10.760]  They're currently at $818.50. And again, Alex, I got to tell you, the market is strong.
[3:45:10.760 --> 3:45:13.760]  I have tried to get some Buffalo coins this morning.
[3:45:13.760 --> 3:45:18.760]  I thought maybe I could get some of those to put on the show today and there's just no supply of them out there.
[3:45:18.760 --> 3:45:22.760]  Absolutely. Historically, the fallen winter is when gold goes crazy.
[3:45:22.760 --> 3:45:27.760]  We're seeing historic strong times right now for gold and silver folks.
[3:45:27.760 --> 3:45:29.760]  Call Midas Resources today.
[3:45:29.760 --> 3:45:32.760]  Don't procrastinate. Don't trust the new world order.
[3:45:32.760 --> 3:45:35.760]  Don't exclusively stand stocks and bonds in the dollar.
[3:45:35.760 --> 3:45:39.760]  Physically hold the gold and silver.
[3:45:39.760 --> 3:45:41.760]  Give them the number, Ted.
[3:45:41.760 --> 3:45:46.760]  1-800-686-2237.
[3:45:46.760 --> 3:45:50.760]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[3:45:50.760 --> 3:45:54.760]  Please mention that you heard it on the Alex Jones hour.
[3:45:54.760 --> 3:45:58.760]  Otherwise, you're going to end up paying more for this stuff just because the prices have gone up.
[3:45:58.760 --> 3:46:05.760]  Yeah, yeah, this special. Ted's a regular capitalist. He buys it, very low markup, sells it right above market.
[3:46:05.760 --> 3:46:08.760]  He does these specials here exclusively.
[3:46:08.760 --> 3:46:11.760]  800-686-2237.
[3:46:11.760 --> 3:46:15.760]  This is a loss leader. So you can get into the market, see what a great deal it is.
[3:46:15.760 --> 3:46:17.760]  Physically hold it, catch the gold bug.
[3:46:17.760 --> 3:46:21.760]  That's what Ted's doing. He's not selling you crack though to get you addicted.
[3:46:21.760 --> 3:46:23.760]  He's selling you gold and silver to get you addicted.
[3:46:23.760 --> 3:46:24.760]  He wants you to try it.
[3:46:24.760 --> 3:46:27.760]  And believe me, this is crack that's good for you.
[3:46:27.760 --> 3:46:30.760]  1-800-686-2237.
[3:46:30.760 --> 3:46:33.760]  800-686-2237.
[3:46:33.760 --> 3:46:34.760]  That's silver deal.
[3:46:34.760 --> 3:46:39.760]  Those Frank and British sovereigns deals you heard are absolutely fabulous deals.
[3:46:39.760 --> 3:46:42.760]  800-686-2237.
[3:46:42.760 --> 3:46:45.760]  A lot of gold and silver analysts have it more than doubling in the next year.
[3:46:45.760 --> 3:46:47.760]  I don't know if that's going to happen.
[3:46:47.760 --> 3:46:50.760]  The point is, I know they can't completely devalue this.
[3:46:50.760 --> 3:46:53.760]  I know it's a hedge against inflation and globalist control.
[3:46:53.760 --> 3:46:57.760]  I know the globalist hoard gold and silver while telling us not to own it.
[3:46:57.760 --> 3:47:00.760]  Give the Midas Resources Brokers a call.
[3:47:00.760 --> 3:47:02.760]  It's low sales pitch.
[3:47:02.760 --> 3:47:03.760]  They'll just take your order.
[3:47:03.760 --> 3:47:06.760]  When you tell them what you want, they'll deliver the order to you.
[3:47:06.760 --> 3:47:07.760]  They just want you as a customer.
[3:47:07.760 --> 3:47:08.760]  Great folks.
[3:47:08.760 --> 3:47:09.760]  Give them a call.
[3:47:09.760 --> 3:47:12.760]  800-686-2237.
[3:47:12.760 --> 3:47:14.760]  And Ted, does this deal go to midnight again?
[3:47:14.760 --> 3:47:16.760]  It goes to midnight tonight.
[3:47:16.760 --> 3:47:17.760]  We'll see what happens tomorrow.
[3:47:17.760 --> 3:47:20.760]  So 800-686-2237.
[3:47:20.760 --> 3:47:22.760]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[3:47:22.760 --> 3:47:23.760]  Thanks, Alex.
[3:47:23.760 --> 3:47:26.760]  They've got some other specials at MidasResources.com, but they won't be that good.
[3:47:26.760 --> 3:47:28.760]  There's still great deals across the board.
[3:47:28.760 --> 3:47:29.760]  That number, have you missed it?
[3:47:29.760 --> 3:47:30.760]  800-686-2237.
[3:47:30.760 --> 3:47:32.760]  All right, let's go to Jeremy in Wisconsin.
[3:47:32.760 --> 3:47:33.760]  Jeremy, you're on the air.
[3:47:33.760 --> 3:47:34.760]  Welcome.
[3:47:34.760 --> 3:47:35.760]  Hi, Alex.
[3:47:35.760 --> 3:47:36.760]  How are you?
[3:47:36.760 --> 3:47:37.760]  Good, buddy.
[3:47:37.760 --> 3:47:42.760]  Well, just recently up here in Milwaukee, there's been a lot of police activity in the city,
[3:47:42.760 --> 3:47:44.760]  which I kind of wanted to bring to attention.
[3:47:44.760 --> 3:47:49.760]  And some of the interesting facts from somebody had to go to an impact class about how they're
[3:47:49.760 --> 3:47:54.760]  going to set up breathalyzer checkpoints in the city that they've been planning for this.
[3:47:54.760 --> 3:47:55.760]  Yeah, that's right.
[3:47:55.760 --> 3:48:00.760]  But the feds say just to get you used to checkpoints like the airport, they're going to be in malls
[3:48:00.760 --> 3:48:01.760]  everywhere.
[3:48:01.760 --> 3:48:05.760]  And then if you say no to the Fourth Amendment violation, they're going to grab a needle out
[3:48:05.760 --> 3:48:07.760]  and start torturing you with it.
[3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:13.760]  And more interesting, the downtown areas were all the restaurants and bars, and it's a pretty
[3:48:13.760 --> 3:48:17.760]  happening place where college students or whoever live in downtown go.
[3:48:17.760 --> 3:48:23.760]  And if you want to hurt these bastards, never use their prescription drugs, never use their
[3:48:23.760 --> 3:48:27.760]  alcohol, or if you do do it at home, don't look.
[3:48:27.760 --> 3:48:29.760]  They're the drug peddlers.
[3:48:29.760 --> 3:48:34.260]  And then cops and local governments have always run the whores and the drugs, and they only
[3:48:34.260 --> 3:48:35.760]  shut down who they don't like.
[3:48:35.760 --> 3:48:36.760]  Don't go down there.
[3:48:36.760 --> 3:48:37.760]  Boycott it.
[3:48:37.760 --> 3:48:38.760]  Say, look, you bastards.
[3:48:38.760 --> 3:48:39.760]  Look, you stinking parasites.
[3:48:39.760 --> 3:48:42.440]  You go ahead and set up your checkpoints.
[3:48:42.440 --> 3:48:43.440]  We're not going down there.
[3:48:43.440 --> 3:48:44.440]  Go ahead.
[3:48:44.440 --> 3:48:48.440]  Well, actually, I stopped going down there just because recently some of the favorite
[3:48:48.440 --> 3:48:53.160]  places to go, they've had some of my favorite restaurants around Sixth Street.
[3:48:53.160 --> 3:48:58.360]  I don't go down there hardly ever like I used to, even though I don't drink, rarely do I
[3:48:58.360 --> 3:48:59.360]  drink.
[3:48:59.360 --> 3:49:01.440]  The point is I don't even go down there because I don't like there.
[3:49:01.440 --> 3:49:03.680]  I don't want to be around the steroid cops.
[3:49:03.680 --> 3:49:04.680]  So it can rot.
[3:49:04.680 --> 3:49:05.680]  It can fall.
[3:49:05.680 --> 3:49:06.680]  But they don't care.
[3:49:06.680 --> 3:49:10.120]  They're like, good, we'll just, we'll just come arrest you for your garage sale, Alex.
[3:49:10.120 --> 3:49:12.120]  We want slaves.
[3:49:12.120 --> 3:49:13.520]  We've legalized slavery again.
[3:49:13.520 --> 3:49:14.520]  I'm sorry.
[3:49:14.520 --> 3:49:15.520]  Go ahead.
[3:49:15.520 --> 3:49:18.280]  Well, they're coming right inside all the restaurants and bars, and they also have their
[3:49:18.280 --> 3:49:19.280]  full truck.
[3:49:19.280 --> 3:49:23.920]  Sir, in Austin, they go in the Radisson Hotel where a guy had three Miller lights watching
[3:49:23.920 --> 3:49:28.680]  the football game, a commuter businessman, and they arrested him when he ordered the
[3:49:28.680 --> 3:49:30.440]  third Miller light an hour.
[3:49:30.440 --> 3:49:32.600]  I know they're just, it's total Soviet Union.
[3:49:32.600 --> 3:49:33.600]  It is.
[3:49:33.600 --> 3:49:34.600]  It is.
[3:49:34.600 --> 3:49:37.280]  Because everyone likes to go for the packer games, you know, and meet up together and
[3:49:37.280 --> 3:49:41.040]  go somewhere and go to the stadium of Miller Park and go there.
[3:49:41.040 --> 3:49:44.480]  But they've been coming into every single place in the city, and I'm trying to warn
[3:49:44.480 --> 3:49:50.320]  people that, and I'm trying to get them a little more informed and going to listen to
[3:49:50.320 --> 3:49:52.920]  other media outlets such as yours.
[3:49:52.920 --> 3:49:57.640]  But hopefully this, you know, spreading this news around is going to help.
[3:49:57.640 --> 3:49:58.640]  Are you kidding?
[3:49:58.640 --> 3:50:03.080]  You better stop the checkpoints there or next, the feds are paying them just like they couldn't
[3:50:03.080 --> 3:50:06.840]  execute that guy in two hours because it wasn't a doctor because doctors won't kill
[3:50:06.840 --> 3:50:12.040]  people because of Hippocratic oath at that execution you heard about the cops.
[3:50:12.040 --> 3:50:15.360]  It's admitted because they've been doing it for 14 years in Arizona.
[3:50:15.360 --> 3:50:17.320]  They just start jamming needles in your arms.
[3:50:17.320 --> 3:50:19.720]  It's like it's fun for them.
[3:50:19.720 --> 3:50:25.560]  And sorry, just saying, well, that the information I got came right from a police officer who
[3:50:25.560 --> 3:50:29.720]  teaches the alcohol assessment classes that someone had told me that they had goat had
[3:50:29.720 --> 3:50:32.920]  got have to go see twice a week.
[3:50:32.920 --> 3:50:37.120]  So I imagine that they're actually going to be implementing this pretty soon here.
[3:50:37.120 --> 3:50:41.040]  Yeah, the only answer, the problem is if you don't drink or do anything, they still make
[3:50:41.040 --> 3:50:42.040]  other stuff illegal.
[3:50:42.040 --> 3:50:46.560]  That's why they're making homeschooling illegal, taking care of your neighbor's kids illegal,
[3:50:46.560 --> 3:50:51.000]  growing and gardening illegal, because they're like, God, we want to arrest these slaves.
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:53.520]  Man, we want to beat them over the head.
[3:50:53.520 --> 3:50:54.720]  How do we do it?
[3:50:54.720 --> 3:50:55.720]  We've got to get more money.
[3:50:55.720 --> 3:50:59.840]  See, the big banks set up the system and the locals suck the money out of you so they
[3:50:59.840 --> 3:51:02.720]  hire thugs to carry it out.
[3:51:02.720 --> 3:51:06.600]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder
[3:51:06.600 --> 3:51:08.600]  would have made a difference in your life?
[3:51:08.600 --> 3:51:12.640]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother
[3:51:12.640 --> 3:51:13.800]  to carry.
[3:51:13.800 --> 3:51:15.040]  That was then.
[3:51:15.040 --> 3:51:16.720]  This is now.
[3:51:16.720 --> 3:51:19.040]  Introducing Dijonet spy sunglasses.
[3:51:19.040 --> 3:51:23.600]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time
[3:51:23.600 --> 3:51:25.040]  audio and video.
[3:51:25.040 --> 3:51:29.700]  The Dijonet sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, unlawful searches and seizures, town
[3:51:29.700 --> 3:51:34.280]  hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[3:51:34.280 --> 3:51:37.680]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[3:51:37.680 --> 3:51:42.400]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[3:51:42.400 --> 3:51:43.800]  Video never lies.
[3:51:43.800 --> 3:51:45.600]  Watch Big Brother back.

[3:51:57.840 --> 3:52:08.840]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:08.840 --> 3:52:14.720]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:52:14.720 --> 3:52:16.640]  just as well-funded.
[3:52:16.640 --> 3:52:21.780]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:52:21.780 --> 3:52:23.280]  of the American people.
[3:52:23.280 --> 3:52:27.320]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:27.320 --> 3:52:32.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist who is imposing
[3:52:32.760 --> 3:52:39.280]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:39.280 --> 3:52:40.960]  It's not about left or right.
[3:52:40.960 --> 3:52:42.840]  It's about a one-world government.
[3:52:42.840 --> 3:52:49.760]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:52:49.760 --> 3:52:55.360]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super-high
[3:52:55.360 --> 3:53:02.760]  quality at PrismPlanet.tv, the Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:53:02.760 --> 3:53:05.000]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[3:53:05.000 --> 3:53:06.000]  Spy on me?
[3:53:06.000 --> 3:53:07.000]  Yeah.
[3:53:07.000 --> 3:53:09.800]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store
[3:53:09.800 --> 3:53:11.120]  them in a giant database?
[3:53:11.120 --> 3:53:12.960]  You should use StartPage instead.
[3:53:12.960 --> 3:53:13.960]  StartPage?
[3:53:13.960 --> 3:53:14.960]  Yeah, StartPage.com.
[3:53:14.960 --> 3:53:17.960]  The new name for Xquik, the world's most private search engine.
[3:53:17.960 --> 3:53:21.800]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[3:53:21.800 --> 3:53:24.800]  Plus, StartPage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[3:53:24.800 --> 3:53:27.240]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the Internet.
[3:53:27.240 --> 3:53:29.080]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[3:53:29.080 --> 3:53:30.080]  Right.

[3:53:32.680 --> 3:53:33.680]  Hello, folks.
[3:53:33.680 --> 3:53:34.800]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:53:34.800 --> 3:53:38.720]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[3:53:38.720 --> 3:53:42.360]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[3:53:42.360 --> 3:53:46.880]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo or Bing, go to StartPage.com

[3:53:50.920 --> 3:53:52.720]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.

[3:53:57.040 --> 3:53:58.320]  That's StartPage.com.
[3:53:58.320 --> 3:54:10.120]  Hey, look what a listener sent us.
[3:54:10.120 --> 3:54:12.080]  Freedom is total government.
[3:54:12.080 --> 3:54:13.920]  Freedom is no freedom.
[3:54:13.920 --> 3:54:16.120]  That's what Uncle Sam says.
[3:54:16.120 --> 3:54:17.120]  Look at these.
[3:54:17.120 --> 3:54:25.680]  It says, in government, we trust slavery 2010 with Obama with a Shea Guevara hat on.
[3:54:25.680 --> 3:54:26.680]  You got to love that.
[3:54:26.680 --> 3:54:27.680]  And there's another one.
[3:54:27.680 --> 3:54:29.880]  It says, caution, new world order ahead.
[3:54:29.880 --> 3:54:37.040]  Potential hazards include military draft, World War III, forced vaccinations.
[3:54:37.040 --> 3:54:38.240]  This sign's been out for years.
[3:54:38.240 --> 3:54:40.400]  Now, notice it's all happening.
[3:54:40.400 --> 3:54:49.000]  Human industrial complex, elite controlled depopulation, smart little ideas folks have
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:54:50.000]  for getting the word out.
[3:54:50.000 --> 3:54:54.400]  There's my little, I'm glad this is only gold plated, though, to show how phony it is.
[3:54:54.400 --> 3:54:58.120]  It would be too honorable to make an actual coin of Obama.
[3:54:58.120 --> 3:54:59.720]  North American Union, $1.
[3:54:59.720 --> 3:55:07.080]  Now, it is corporate communism where the profits are given to them and we pay for it all.
[3:55:07.080 --> 3:55:09.880]  Let's jam in Shelly in Texas and a few other Shelly.
[3:55:09.880 --> 3:55:10.880]  We're on the air.
[3:55:10.880 --> 3:55:11.880]  Welcome.
[3:55:11.880 --> 3:55:12.880]  Hi, Alex.
[3:55:12.880 --> 3:55:14.880]  Thank you.
[3:55:14.880 --> 3:55:18.760]  I could sit up here for hours with you, but I've got a couple of questions if you can
[3:55:18.760 --> 3:55:19.760]  please answer.
[3:55:19.760 --> 3:55:20.760]  Sure, I'll try.
[3:55:20.760 --> 3:55:27.240]  The last thing I heard you say in regards to the troops that have been deployed to patrol
[3:55:27.240 --> 3:55:36.720]  the states, I'm sorry, the streets of the U.S. with 379,000, is that, are they, where
[3:55:36.720 --> 3:55:37.720]  are they moving to?
[3:55:37.720 --> 3:55:38.720]  I'm in Houston.
[3:55:38.720 --> 3:55:42.480]  So I'm looking at like, how soon can I expect them here?
[3:55:42.480 --> 3:55:49.160]  And my second question is, my son is four, and I wish I would have held off and kept
[3:55:49.160 --> 3:55:54.520]  him out of school, but I enrolled him in pre-K. And his teacher even told me that, yeah, they're
[3:55:54.520 --> 3:55:59.600]  supposed to call the public officials, but what can I actually do as far as taking him
[3:55:59.600 --> 3:56:02.760]  out of school and making sure that he doesn't get the vaccine?
[3:56:02.760 --> 3:56:08.680]  Well, no, you just say to the health department or to the school nurse, just matter of fact,
[3:56:08.680 --> 3:56:12.480]  they'll lie because they get money if they get everybody to be vaccinated, like 97% is
[3:56:12.480 --> 3:56:16.040]  the number, target number to get the federal funds, say, oh, yeah, I need that vaccine
[3:56:16.040 --> 3:56:20.600]  exemption form and they'll, they'll, they'll try to say, well, why are you exempt as if
[3:56:20.600 --> 3:56:21.600]  you're dumb?
[3:56:21.600 --> 3:56:25.720]  See, government's all about lying and deceiving and then they've got info you don't have.
[3:56:25.720 --> 3:56:30.160]  You need to just say, listen to civil rights violation for you to not give me that waiver
[3:56:30.160 --> 3:56:31.160]  form.
[3:56:31.160 --> 3:56:32.360]  I don't even need the waiver.
[3:56:32.360 --> 3:56:34.480]  It's a waiver for a policy.
[3:56:34.480 --> 3:56:36.440]  And once you have the waiver form, you're fine.
[3:56:36.440 --> 3:56:38.280]  You send it into the health department.
[3:56:38.280 --> 3:56:41.320]  But they do list you like Jews had to wear yellow stars.
[3:56:41.320 --> 3:56:45.240]  They do put you in a database, but that's how they'll leave you alone at the school.
[3:56:45.240 --> 3:56:49.520]  But the criminals will, in every case we've seen, try to not give it to you, proving their
[3:56:49.520 --> 3:56:51.520]  criminals.
[3:56:51.520 --> 3:56:57.920]  But as for troops, all we know is the Pentagon has deployed 40,000 troops in the U S for
[3:56:57.920 --> 3:56:58.920]  brigade homeland.
[3:56:58.920 --> 3:57:02.600]  First, it was 4,000, then it was 20, now it's 40.
[3:57:02.600 --> 3:57:10.920]  A few months ago was in AP and the progressive, it's in the new film, uh, fall the republic.
[3:57:10.920 --> 3:57:14.560]  That they went to the Pentagon, the Pentagon went to Congress and requested, this is in
[3:57:14.560 --> 3:57:21.320]  congressional testimony, the funding for 379,000 troops that they want to deploy over the next
[3:57:21.320 --> 3:57:28.320]  year inside the United States to quote combat gun owners, veterans, libertarians, you know,
[3:57:28.320 --> 3:57:29.840]  they list.
[3:57:29.840 --> 3:57:33.800]  They said threats to the homeland and then we have the DHS report that lists those.
[3:57:33.800 --> 3:57:40.760]  So yes, it's really happening, but, but first it'll be over just out helping at car wrecks
[3:57:40.760 --> 3:57:46.520]  over helping at the sports stadium over, we're just out here directing traffic, ma'am.
[3:57:46.520 --> 3:57:50.280]  It's all the condition, everybody, including the troops.
[3:57:50.280 --> 3:57:53.880]  And then all the old drunks that, you know, they'll come out and go, what are you some
[3:57:53.880 --> 3:57:55.520]  kind of commie?
[3:57:55.520 --> 3:57:58.680]  You know, they don't care if the troops get their medical care cut.
[3:57:58.680 --> 3:58:00.280]  They don't care if they're dying of vaccines.
[3:58:00.280 --> 3:58:01.800]  They don't really care about the troops.
[3:58:01.800 --> 3:58:06.600]  They just want to get drunk and call on the talk radio and go, shut down Alex Jones up.
[3:58:06.600 --> 3:58:08.400]  We need troops in America.
[3:58:08.400 --> 3:58:11.800]  He hates the military.
[3:58:11.800 --> 3:58:12.800]  God bless you, man.
[3:58:12.800 --> 3:58:13.800]  Anything else?
[3:58:13.800 --> 3:58:14.800]  Shelly.

[3:58:22.960 --> 3:58:23.960]  line.
