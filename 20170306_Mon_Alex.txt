[00:00.000 --> 00:07.360]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[00:07.360 --> 00:09.600]  a war on for your mind.
[00:09.600 --> 00:17.440]  All right, this is going to be a big live broadcast today.
[00:17.440 --> 00:22.240]  Bruce Fine, the former head counsel for the Federal Communications Commission and former
[00:22.240 --> 00:26.200]  head of the Ron Paul campaign and a guy that's a big patriot in Washington with his ear to
[00:26.200 --> 00:31.760]  ground is going to be coming on in the middle of the next hour to break down what's really
[00:31.760 --> 00:34.880]  going on with Trump in D.C. and it's serious.
[00:34.880 --> 00:40.880]  We also have several soldiers coming on the broadcast to announce an initiative that we've
[00:40.880 --> 00:45.600]  kind of come up with that since we made a few phone calls yesterday has already exploded.
[00:45.600 --> 00:50.200]  So that will be announced coming up at the bottom of the tower as well.
[00:50.200 --> 00:54.280]  This is a big transmission, obviously, ladies and gentlemen, Sessions recused himself without
[00:54.280 --> 00:56.400]  Trump even authorizing it.
[00:56.400 --> 00:57.720]  Trump is absolutely infuriated.
[00:57.720 --> 00:58.720]  We told you that on Friday.
[00:58.720 --> 00:59.720]  Now it's in Newsmax.
[00:59.720 --> 01:01.680]  Bruce Reddy, talk to the president.
[01:01.680 --> 01:04.640]  We'll be back after this special report from John Bowne.
[01:04.640 --> 01:08.720]  When we've got presidents doing corrupt things and lying and getting our military into fraudulent
[01:08.720 --> 01:11.880]  wars, it doesn't mean we're against the military to speak out against it.
[01:11.880 --> 01:15.960]  Means we're for the country and for the military.
[01:15.960 --> 01:19.560]  Our military has been sent into these last few set of wars, should he stabilize the Middle
[01:19.560 --> 01:25.920]  East as far of a long term plan to then bring in the Wahhabists and the Saudi Arabian jihadis
[01:25.920 --> 01:31.320]  and take over not just the Middle East, but much of Central Asia, much of the country's
[01:31.320 --> 01:37.280]  bordering Russia, much of Europe, and to then even colonize the UK.
[01:37.280 --> 01:43.000]  There's an incredible video that we've had to bleep that's up on infowars.com in England.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.640]  I personally have experienced this and I noticed that the Brits all start bowing down and
[01:47.640 --> 01:50.920]  groveling to them, but they come over to my face and I start yelling back.
[01:50.920 --> 01:54.080]  I say, number one, you're in a public place.
[01:54.080 --> 02:00.200]  I'm videotaping this building as a cutaway shot and I say, shut up, stop yelling at me.
[02:00.200 --> 02:01.560]  I've got a TV show.
[02:01.560 --> 02:08.040]  I'm getting a cutaway of the building so I can go in and say I went to interview such
[02:08.040 --> 02:13.680]  and such and that's the attitude when you run into the Muslims in France, in Germany
[02:13.680 --> 02:14.680]  or in England.
[02:14.680 --> 02:18.040]  This was the attitude ten years ago.
[02:18.040 --> 02:21.840]  This French report says almost one in five Frenchmen have been victims of racist insults
[02:21.840 --> 02:23.000]  or worse.
[02:23.000 --> 02:25.760]  A few cases have even gone to trial.
[02:25.760 --> 02:31.520]  Some of those who launch racist attacks on whites use Islam as the reason they do it.
[02:31.520 --> 02:36.240]  They may not even speak Arabic, but they still use Islam as a flag.
[02:36.240 --> 02:40.200]  My crew ran into it in France last year when there were more terror attacks and bombings
[02:40.200 --> 02:42.080]  and truck attacks.
[02:42.080 --> 02:47.080]  This is known as the jihadist capital of Europe and it's known as a Muslim no-go ghetto for
[02:47.080 --> 02:52.200]  a reason because it is and I'm basically sick to the back teeth of the left wing pretending,
[02:52.200 --> 02:56.920]  hiding behind political correctness and saying that these Muslim no-go areas don't exist.
[02:56.920 --> 02:57.920]  They do exist.
[02:57.920 --> 02:59.040]  Try going to one.
[02:59.040 --> 03:02.600]  We were harassed out of this vehicle, we were flipped off, we were screamed at, we tried
[03:02.600 --> 03:07.280]  to go into a restaurant and the guy outside basically said no white people are allowed
[03:07.280 --> 03:08.280]  in this restaurant.
[03:08.280 --> 03:11.840]  And what happens is, especially in England, when the muzzles move into your neighborhood,
[03:11.840 --> 03:14.240]  then they start burning your cars at night.
[03:14.240 --> 03:17.040]  I'm not saying this guy or his family, but this has been on the news.
[03:17.040 --> 03:22.120]  They start burning your cars if you're a native person until you move out of the area.
[03:22.120 --> 03:26.200]  That then drives down prices in the houses and then more folks can move in.
[03:26.200 --> 03:27.200]  Do you eat pork?
[03:27.200 --> 03:28.200]  Can you f***** look like pork?
[03:28.200 --> 03:29.200]  Yeah.
[03:29.200 --> 03:30.200]  You f***** pig.
[03:30.200 --> 03:34.720]  It's a short clip, but it just illustrates everything of this guy anywhere in the United
[03:34.720 --> 03:40.480]  States, unless he was in Berkeley or other areas where they only have chicken necks for
[03:40.480 --> 03:41.480]  some reason.
[03:41.480 --> 03:46.080]  This guy would have been laid out as jawbroken, just like that.
[03:46.080 --> 03:50.200]  His nose would have been smashed in really fast when he hit a woman.
[03:50.200 --> 03:54.880]  But see, men have been trained, whether it's in Germany, you name it, to allow women to
[03:54.880 --> 04:01.440]  be attacked, to be, you name it, because the new culture of being a Western male, I don't
[04:01.440 --> 04:04.880]  care if you're white, Hispanic, what you are, is to be a c**k.
[04:04.880 --> 04:09.880]  Allah hakarra malmr'ata bihādihi l'uqūbah, a'qūbah tad-barb.
[04:09.880 --> 04:14.880]  Qāla Nabi Yunā, sallallahu alayhi wa alayhi wa alayhi wa sallam, wa la tadrb il-wajhār.
[04:14.880 --> 04:15.880]  Teaching to be women.
[04:15.880 --> 04:16.880]  Allah wala tuqabh.
[04:16.880 --> 04:19.880]  Shuf karramah.
[04:19.880 --> 04:24.040]  So you will know them because they attack women, whether they're Islamists, whether
[04:24.040 --> 04:27.880]  they are trendies, whether they're black bloc, whether they're black lives matter and
[04:27.880 --> 04:31.840]  anarchists doesn't matter, you have to ask yourself, what are the social engineers doing?
[04:31.840 --> 04:35.280]  Well they admit in Sweden and Germany and France and everywhere else, they're bringing
[04:35.280 --> 04:40.320]  in groups that are quote anti-European, anti-white, anti-Christian, and the Pope says he doesn't
[04:40.320 --> 04:43.200]  want to hear about Christianity and Europe at Disguston.
[04:43.200 --> 04:47.400]  So again, this is meant to put people in their balkanized groups, so everyone actually
[04:47.400 --> 04:54.360]  retreats into their racial or religious enclaves, then the government controls all these ghettos
[04:54.360 --> 04:55.680]  that they have basically set up.
[04:55.680 --> 05:00.120]  It's a prison model of management.
[05:00.120 --> 05:04.680]  I'm beginning to think Mexico's border policy and immigration policy is whatever goes against
[05:04.680 --> 05:05.680]  Trump.
[05:05.680 --> 05:10.360]  In an unprecedented move, the Mexican government is now paying $50 million to give legal support
[05:10.360 --> 05:13.160]  to Mexican nationals living in the U.S. illegally.
[05:13.160 --> 05:17.120]  So Mexico won't pay for a wall, but they will pay for people who leave Mexico for the United
[05:17.120 --> 05:19.160]  States, I guess because it's better.
[05:19.160 --> 05:22.040]  If you do so legally though, they have no funding for you.
[05:22.040 --> 05:25.880]  All 50 Mexican consulates to the U.S. are launching legal assistance centers for Mexican
[05:25.880 --> 05:29.240]  nationals living in the U.S. illegally who are fearing deportation.
[05:29.240 --> 05:33.320]  In contrast, however, I could not go to Mexico and have the U.S. government pay any legal
[05:33.320 --> 05:35.880]  fees I may incur for migrating illegally.
[05:35.880 --> 05:38.960]  And why would Mexico pay people who left their country?
[05:38.960 --> 05:41.840]  Is Mexico that bad they just refuse to go back?
[05:41.840 --> 05:45.960]  Or are the people that left Mexico that bad they're paying to keep them out?
[05:45.960 --> 05:51.320]  No, I think any anti-Trump politicians from anywhere on earth have now abandoned all logic,
[05:51.320 --> 05:56.320]  all common sense, all true policy and diplomacy and attempt to go against anything President
[05:56.320 --> 05:57.400]  Trump tries to do.
[05:57.400 --> 06:00.160]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[06:00.160 --> 06:05.280]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[06:05.280 --> 06:08.600]  before it became lost to our modern diets a processed junk.
[06:08.600 --> 06:13.840]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLive.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[06:13.840 --> 06:20.040]  bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom and seven total primal super foods in a single
[06:20.040 --> 06:22.400]  great tasting formula, Caveman.
[06:22.400 --> 06:26.400]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[06:26.400 --> 06:27.400]  superior ancestors.
[06:27.400 --> 06:30.360]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[06:30.360 --> 06:34.400]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you used the meat for sustenance,
[06:34.400 --> 06:39.720]  the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength from the outside structure full
[06:39.720 --> 06:43.640]  of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[06:43.640 --> 06:46.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[06:46.200 --> 06:50.520]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[06:50.520 --> 06:54.120]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[06:54.120 --> 06:58.600]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself in InfowarsLive.com
[06:58.600 --> 06:59.880]  today.
[06:59.880 --> 07:03.920]  Electrify your day with Secret 12, it's like lightning in a bottle.
[07:03.920 --> 07:07.840]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.

[07:12.480 --> 07:16.000]  tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.720]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[07:20.720 --> 07:25.280]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our
[07:25.280 --> 07:26.760]  modern diets.
[07:26.760 --> 07:31.880]  Secret 12 by InfowarsLive is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake
[07:31.880 --> 07:34.320]  and support your body's natural systems.

[07:39.280 --> 07:43.080]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding
[07:43.080 --> 07:48.440]  in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[07:48.440 --> 07:52.080]  Electrify your mind and body, and take your health to the next level.
[07:52.080 --> 08:20.680]  It's the power of Secret 12 at InfowarsLive.com, that's InfowarsLive.com.
[08:23.040 --> 08:29.840]  Three weeks ago, when General Flynn resigned, that he was basically told to resign, told
[08:29.840 --> 08:34.600]  that the president had ordered him to resign, and he didn't even go in and ask the president,
[08:34.600 --> 08:37.200]  he just resigned.
[08:37.200 --> 08:41.240]  And the word I got Friday before it even came out on Saturday was that President Trump
[08:41.240 --> 08:48.720]  was absolutely infuriated, and it's now in the news, that he had not even talked to the
[08:48.720 --> 08:53.200]  Attorney General about recusing himself, and that it's ridiculous that the Attorney General,
[08:53.200 --> 08:55.200]  if he had sessions, recused himself.
[08:55.200 --> 08:59.600]  When he was very clear, he was asked about Russians talking to them as surrogates on
[08:59.600 --> 09:00.600]  the campaign trail.
[09:00.600 --> 09:05.440]  Of course, he, as the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee of the Senate, spoke
[09:05.440 --> 09:07.440]  with the Russians twice that year.
[09:07.440 --> 09:11.960]  So this is running scared, and Drudge has the headline, but we've been calling it since
[09:11.960 --> 09:13.200]  day one.
[09:13.200 --> 09:19.320]  Damn smell, blood in the water, Comey turns on Trump.
[09:19.320 --> 09:28.560]  Now, the most amazing thing about all of this is, I went and pulled the reports yesterday
[09:28.560 --> 09:34.080]  and did a special live report at one o'clock, and a lot of you watched it.
[09:34.080 --> 09:38.560]  We also aired excerpts of it on Yesterday's Sunday show, and I went and pulled up the
[09:38.560 --> 09:44.400]  articles from a month ago, when they were all over the news saying wiretaps, tracking
[09:44.400 --> 09:52.880]  the Trump Organization, and tracking phone calls out of Trump Tower, recorded General
[09:52.880 --> 09:58.400]  Flynn talking to the Russian Ambassador, and they went, oh, it's so dirty, it's so bad.
[09:58.400 --> 10:03.680]  When he admittedly was setting up the phone calls, through the Ambassador for a call with
[10:03.680 --> 10:10.560]  the President in Putin, that's what Presidents do.
[10:10.560 --> 10:13.200]  But they were all over the news saying they had the transcript.
[10:13.200 --> 10:15.360]  The New York Times had it.
[10:15.360 --> 10:23.480]  Obama, last week, before all this latest wiretapping broke, before Trump stood up against it, said
[10:23.480 --> 10:27.400]  they gave it to the New York Times, that they, quote, protected the intelligence, so that
[10:27.400 --> 10:28.680]  Trump couldn't get rid of it.
[10:28.680 --> 10:34.640]  Oh, we committed a crime, so Trump couldn't get rid of it.
[10:34.640 --> 10:40.640]  And then they have Brennan and Clapper and all the usual suspects on TV on the Sunday
[10:40.640 --> 10:49.760]  shows yesterday saying Trump's crazy, they use words like preposterous, they use words
[10:49.760 --> 10:57.560]  like reckless, just bizarre, that Trump says his transition team was under surveillance
[10:57.560 --> 10:59.000]  and, of course, nothing was found.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.640]  Where do you think President Trump got that?
[11:02.640 --> 11:06.720]  On Monday, type it in.
[11:06.720 --> 11:13.840]  The House head of the Intelligence Board committee, Nunez, said we've been reviewing the evidence
[11:13.840 --> 11:14.840]  for a month.
[11:14.840 --> 11:20.080]  There's nothing there, not even phone calls.
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.280]  Until General Flynn is in there supposedly for the President as the National Security
[11:24.280 --> 11:32.080]  Advisor, lining up his phone calls with world leaders, Flynn who's known to work 18 hours
[11:32.080 --> 11:33.080]  a day.
[11:33.080 --> 11:37.080]  Oh, everybody else stands around with their thumbs in their rear ends, I'm sorry.
[11:37.080 --> 11:41.000]  So this has just become unbelievable.
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.480]  For those of us that actually pay attention, for those of us that actually know the narrative,
[11:45.480 --> 11:48.680]  the real narrative and know what really goes on in government and knows what was really
[11:48.680 --> 11:53.520]  said, and who have memories, remember what Gruber said, John Gruber, he said thank God
[11:53.520 --> 11:58.280]  the American people have low attention spans and are so stupid and are low information
[11:58.280 --> 11:59.280]  voters.
[11:59.280 --> 12:01.640]  Those are quotes.
[12:01.640 --> 12:04.360]  I don't have a seven second attention span.
[12:04.360 --> 12:10.080]  They've got studies out where children now have less of an attention span than goldfish
[12:10.080 --> 12:12.200]  if they're TV heads.
[12:12.200 --> 12:14.160]  It's fact.
[12:14.160 --> 12:20.360]  So you have to understand, they're targeting the listeners and viewers of MSM that literally
[12:20.360 --> 12:26.640]  do not believe or remember that a month ago it was on every TV channel, every news channel,
[12:26.640 --> 12:32.240]  every newspaper, everywhere that they had surveilled Trump and oh, Flynn lied.
[12:32.240 --> 12:39.320]  He'd talked about sanctions with the Russian ambassador.
[12:39.320 --> 12:43.880]  And then they finally released the transcript The New York Times and it was, well, I can't
[12:43.880 --> 12:46.800]  talk about those with you, but I'm sure that you know the President wants to have a reset.
[12:46.800 --> 12:52.160]  So I'm sure you can bring that up when President Putin and President Trump speak.
[12:52.160 --> 12:54.080]  That's not discussing sanctions.
[12:54.080 --> 12:56.320]  Did you discuss the sanctions?
[12:56.320 --> 12:57.320]  No.
[12:57.320 --> 12:59.160]  Did you line up a discussion about them?
[12:59.160 --> 13:00.160]  Absolutely.
[13:00.160 --> 13:04.960]  See, they play these games, but in real government, in the military at those levels and in law,
[13:04.960 --> 13:09.520]  they train everybody to answer exactly as they're asked because they don't want a bunch
[13:09.520 --> 13:11.520]  of obfuscation.
[13:11.520 --> 13:16.800]  But they use that to manipulate sessions and Flynn and others, just like what Al Franken
[13:16.800 --> 13:17.800]  says.
[13:17.800 --> 13:24.240]  Did you as a main surrogate or any other surrogates on the campaign have any communications with
[13:24.240 --> 13:25.800]  the Russians about the campaign?
[13:25.800 --> 13:31.360]  No, no discussions with the Russians about the campaign.
[13:31.360 --> 13:38.360]  So that's what they are basically pushing and doing here and it's amazing.
[13:38.360 --> 13:41.200]  But here's the big enchilada.
[13:41.200 --> 13:42.200]  Here's the thing.
[13:42.200 --> 13:43.200]  Everybody needs to understand.
[13:43.200 --> 13:46.200]  I'm sure most of you already get this, probably better than I do.
[13:46.200 --> 13:49.080]  I'm always speaking to those that may not know they're new listeners, so that's kind
[13:49.080 --> 13:52.840]  of annoying to regular listeners, but we got to keep reaching out to just the new folks
[13:52.840 --> 13:54.840]  that tune in.
[13:54.840 --> 13:56.360]  You don't have to believe a word I've said here.
[13:56.360 --> 14:00.440]  You can go back if you don't have a memory and look up where they said that they had
[14:00.440 --> 14:03.160]  all these communications out of Trump Tower and it was a bluff.
[14:03.160 --> 14:04.320]  There wasn't anything there.
[14:04.320 --> 14:06.480]  It was so thin, it was like vapor.
[14:06.480 --> 14:07.480]  Okay.
[14:07.480 --> 14:11.520]  So yeah, they lined up phone calls for the incoming president with foreign leaders.
[14:11.520 --> 14:15.240]  He talked to the British prime minister, the Italian president, the German president, hundreds
[14:15.240 --> 14:16.240]  of world leaders.
[14:16.240 --> 14:21.720]  Hell, when I talked to Trump three days after he was elected president, he said, Alex, you're
[14:21.720 --> 14:25.560]  like number, whatever, I forget the number, because I've been talking to world leaders
[14:25.560 --> 14:29.040]  and royalty and business leaders all day, but you're on the list because your listeners
[14:29.040 --> 14:30.040]  are so awesome.
[14:30.040 --> 14:33.680]  Thank them for their support and this big win and we're not going to let them down.
[14:33.680 --> 14:34.680]  Let them know that.
[14:34.680 --> 14:38.320]  And I'm like, sir, they are going to come after you.
[14:38.320 --> 14:39.320]  They're never going to stop.
[14:39.320 --> 14:42.520]  I know you think you're going to give folks prosperity and do this, but you've got to
[14:42.520 --> 14:43.520]  go after them.
[14:43.520 --> 14:48.000]  You've got to get on the offense because they are going to come after you and I'm not going
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.840]  to get into our private conversation about that.
[14:49.840 --> 14:58.720]  But let's just say the president knew that, but he's trying to take the ultra high road
[14:58.720 --> 15:02.880]  and he just wants to turn the economy back on and that's why he could leave Obamacare
[15:02.880 --> 15:07.080]  there for a year and let the Democrats get the blame for it and then the $5,000 fines
[15:07.080 --> 15:10.360]  and the rest of it, but he doesn't want to hurt small businesses and the average person.
[15:10.360 --> 15:14.520]  So he's just like a stalwart doing the real deal.
[15:14.520 --> 15:24.080]  I mean, I studied everything going on morning, noon and night and Trump is so good, so honorable.
[15:24.080 --> 15:28.320]  It makes me sick to my stomach to see him being rejected by so many dumbed down people
[15:28.320 --> 15:29.840]  that aren't even part of the power structure.
[15:29.840 --> 15:34.680]  And then I look at the power structure against him, a bunch of addled, doddering weirdos like
[15:34.680 --> 15:40.600]  Schumer and Pelosi and Maxine Waters that don't know what planets are on and they're
[15:40.600 --> 15:45.640]  like, we never have met with the Russian ambassador and there's just photo after photo of Schumer
[15:45.640 --> 15:50.160]  and Pelosi and all of them meeting with him at public dinners and public events and meeting
[15:50.160 --> 15:55.120]  and on their schedule meeting with them three, four, five times depending on who it is, then
[15:55.120 --> 16:01.800]  they did with sessions, a piece because that's who you meet with when you're at the top of
[16:01.800 --> 16:04.400]  the Democratic Party or the top of the Republican Party.
[16:04.400 --> 16:06.520]  That's what goes on.
[16:06.520 --> 16:11.120]  You meet with the Japanese, you meet with the Chinese, you meet with the South Africans,
[16:11.120 --> 16:15.440]  you meet with the Brazilians, you meet with the Mexicans, you meet with any big, strong,
[16:15.440 --> 16:19.040]  rich, powerful country.
[16:19.040 --> 16:22.440]  People can say, oh, well, Brazil or Mexico aren't powerful.
[16:22.440 --> 16:23.440]  Yeah, they are.
[16:23.440 --> 16:24.440]  Their people aren't.
[16:24.440 --> 16:25.440]  They're super rich.
[16:25.440 --> 16:26.440]  Some of them are most powerful in the world.
[16:26.440 --> 16:33.200]  The point is, is that there's constant meetings going on around the clock, ladies and gentlemen,
[16:33.200 --> 16:36.880]  and they play on the public's ignorance about how government works, but that's not even
[16:36.880 --> 16:37.880]  the big enchilada.
[16:37.880 --> 16:42.840]  Let me give you the big kahuna.
[16:42.840 --> 16:45.520]  You really got to hand it to these globalists.
[16:45.520 --> 16:46.520]  Their minions are stupid.
[16:46.520 --> 16:48.360]  Their minions are dumbed down because they follow orders.
[16:48.360 --> 16:53.040]  That's why they've been chosen.
[16:53.040 --> 16:56.200]  You really got to hand it to them, don't you?
[16:56.200 --> 17:02.520]  You really got to hand it to them because we had MSM and all the major pollsters caught
[17:02.520 --> 17:03.520]  lying.
[17:03.520 --> 17:07.240]  We had Hillary caught in the WikiLeaks with CNN and other news channels getting the questions
[17:07.240 --> 17:13.440]  beforehand, telling the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, ABC News, NBC, what to do,
[17:13.440 --> 17:19.520]  what headlines to have, what to push, sending people to Trump rallies to attack women.
[17:19.520 --> 17:24.480]  All of it there, all of it in everybody's face.
[17:24.480 --> 17:28.600]  And the repudiation of globalism and just the huge awakening happening and everything
[17:28.600 --> 17:38.080]  the MSM could do being destroyed and broken when it came head to head with the worldwide
[17:38.080 --> 17:41.840]  awakening that's taking place that Trump's just part of.
[17:41.840 --> 17:48.720]  And now, slowly but surely, the Russian narrative, as I said, right after you got elected on
[17:48.720 --> 17:54.400]  November 8th at three in the morning with Roger Stone sit around here, I said, Roger,
[17:54.400 --> 17:57.240]  now the fight's even more serious because we've taken the high road and actually won
[17:57.240 --> 17:58.240]  this battle.
[17:58.240 --> 18:00.480]  They're going to throw everything they've got against Trump and the American people
[18:00.480 --> 18:02.360]  and others now.
[18:02.360 --> 18:08.360]  And we are in the fight of our lives right now and this is just beginning and I said
[18:08.360 --> 18:12.280]  they're going to ramp up this Russian narrative and they're going to push it everywhere and
[18:12.280 --> 18:15.880]  they're going to sit there knowing the public's ignorant and every time.
[18:15.880 --> 18:20.600]  Even Trump, even trying to meet now, because now we've forgotten all about our glorious
[18:20.600 --> 18:24.880]  victory, all about how the system got overturned, all about how they got caught lying and we're
[18:24.880 --> 18:25.960]  totally discredited.
[18:25.960 --> 18:34.640]  It's all moved on to how our Americana, God guts and guns president is a Ruski.
[18:34.640 --> 18:38.680]  And the Ruskies, they're the reason Trump won, so they steal that victory from you.
[18:38.680 --> 18:44.760]  They demoralize the American people, so they demoralized our military with 24 suicides
[18:44.760 --> 18:49.400]  a day.
[18:49.400 --> 18:56.200]  And they just roll forward and distract from all the crimes they've committed, all the
[18:56.200 --> 18:58.040]  horrible things they've done.
[18:58.040 --> 19:01.680]  But that's only if we sit there even debate these narratives because we're supposed to
[19:01.680 --> 19:05.920]  debate whether they were under surveillance.
[19:05.920 --> 19:11.840]  The House Intelligence Committee was given all the phone calls and the transcripts of
[19:11.840 --> 19:15.680]  the people in Trump Tower in the transition.
[19:15.680 --> 19:21.080]  And the head of the committee came out and said there's nothing, not even phone calls
[19:21.080 --> 19:22.200]  in the so-called data.
[19:22.200 --> 19:26.160]  So first they make up that they found all this intelligence while surveilling the president.
[19:26.160 --> 19:30.160]  I'm skipping the break.
[19:30.160 --> 19:33.560]  Then they run that for a month saying there's all this evidence of Roger Stone, everybody
[19:33.560 --> 19:36.200]  else involved, Paul Manaford.
[19:36.200 --> 19:37.200]  Then there's nothing there.
[19:37.200 --> 19:48.120]  So then they come out and say there were no wiretaps, but we know you're a Russian agent.
[19:48.120 --> 19:52.360]  And then that becomes the whole debate about were there wiretaps or weren't there when
[19:52.360 --> 19:59.160]  all you got to do is pull up thousands of headlines, thousands of headlines, thousands.
[19:59.160 --> 20:07.080]  Remember, it's the number one news story for weeks.
[20:07.080 --> 20:08.640]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[20:08.640 --> 20:15.600]  You're ready to listen, we're putting headlines up from January and from December where they
[20:15.600 --> 20:20.840]  were saying, oh, Manaford's lying, Stone's lying, Trump's lying, Flynn's lying.
[20:20.840 --> 20:22.160]  We have all the recordings.
[20:22.160 --> 20:23.640]  We have it all.
[20:23.640 --> 20:30.320]  And then they try to argue, well, we were only spying through the British and GSGQ of
[20:30.320 --> 20:33.240]  the Russians and their phone calls to the United States.
[20:33.240 --> 20:38.360]  No, they were tapping the whole system, and by the way, we have George W. Bush's former
[20:38.360 --> 20:42.360]  Attorney General coming out and saying that no doubt they spied on him and did it.
[20:42.360 --> 20:44.760]  It's admitted.
[20:44.760 --> 20:46.320]  Did Trump Tower wiretaps exist?
[20:46.320 --> 20:48.000]  Former AG says yes.
[20:48.000 --> 20:49.000]  And here's why.
[20:49.000 --> 20:50.480]  Here's another one.
[20:50.480 --> 20:54.880]  Former CIA analyst, Obama gave green light for NSA CIA to sabotage Trump.
[20:54.880 --> 20:55.880]  Of course they did.
[20:55.880 --> 20:58.760]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[20:58.760 --> 21:03.600]  Each state, Trump ends the wiretapping innuendo game by dealing himself in.
[21:03.600 --> 21:04.760]  He's the president.
[21:04.760 --> 21:12.640]  He could sign executive orders killing the power that they got from executive orders.
[21:12.640 --> 21:13.640]  This is amazing.
[21:13.640 --> 21:19.000]  I mean, really, talk show hosts overuse the word amazing or incredible, but I mean, this
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.080]  is incredible.
[21:23.080 --> 21:27.400]  And by the way, if a Russian agent wants to cut our taxes, secure our borders, strengthen
[21:27.400 --> 21:31.960]  our military, build a new nuclear weapons arsenal and hypersonic missiles like the Russians
[21:31.960 --> 21:35.200]  have and the Chinese have developed, oh, they got our technology, the Chinese, and we didn't
[21:35.200 --> 21:36.200]  even build it ourselves.
[21:36.200 --> 21:39.880]  If he actually wants to get big banks to loan to small businesses, if he actually wants
[21:39.880 --> 21:44.920]  to get the government out of our lives, I mean, well, then I mean, he's not a Russian
[21:44.920 --> 21:45.920]  agent.
[21:45.920 --> 21:46.920]  It's not true.
[21:46.920 --> 21:51.240]  But boy, the Russians sure are better than our Democrats and our Republicans, aren't they?
[21:51.240 --> 21:57.360]  I mean, if the Russians want to get rid of Obamacare, if the Russians don't want to
[21:57.360 --> 22:02.000]  have internet censorship, if the Russians want to have a free society, well, then I guess
[22:02.000 --> 22:03.800]  we're Russia then, but we're not.
[22:03.800 --> 22:05.760]  It's ridiculous.
[22:05.760 --> 22:08.280]  But it's meant to cause a debate about that.
[22:08.280 --> 22:09.280]  The MSM has no credibility.
[22:09.280 --> 22:11.000]  They have a lower approval rating than Congress.
[22:11.000 --> 22:12.040]  They know that.
[22:12.040 --> 22:20.680]  But all they can do is come out without outrageous accusations, outrageous accusations like somebody
[22:20.680 --> 22:22.040]  losing a court case against you.
[22:22.040 --> 22:23.760]  So they ask you, you love Hitler, don't you?
[22:23.760 --> 22:26.400]  Are you, you know, you rape Easter bunnies?
[22:26.400 --> 22:28.320]  Or you, you're a child molester.
[22:28.320 --> 22:35.560]  It's the last refuge of scum and everybody knows what they're doing except for one group.
[22:35.560 --> 22:39.200]  And I like Jeff Sessions and I like a lot of the folks that are in there, but I told
[22:39.200 --> 22:43.280]  you the knives are out for a previous.
[22:43.280 --> 22:44.480]  It's previously can everything.
[22:44.480 --> 22:45.480]  He can't help it.
[22:45.480 --> 22:56.280]  And he's a Republican, a Republican palm greaser who just runs around minyoning to Paul Ryan
[22:56.280 --> 23:02.280]  and the rest of them who are bought and paid for by the globalist and have a big screaming.
[23:02.280 --> 23:06.480]  You know what for Trump, because they want to use America for their global power and
[23:06.480 --> 23:10.640]  parlaying their power to the new world order system.
[23:10.640 --> 23:15.440]  And they just have disdain for the American people to stain for Trump, to stain for God,
[23:15.440 --> 23:18.360]  to stain for the family.
[23:18.360 --> 23:24.560]  They think they're better than you.
[23:24.560 --> 23:30.000]  And so there's video, they caught surveillance, they never did this with Obama with super
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.960]  zoom cameras from a half mile away from CNN in the windows of the White House.
[23:34.960 --> 23:41.760]  And they catch Jared Kushner coming by and clearly it's previously Kushner walked by
[23:41.760 --> 23:46.160]  and then Bannon is jumping up yelling and I'm like, I told you, you idiots, what the
[23:46.160 --> 23:48.720]  hell's your problem?
[23:48.720 --> 23:53.000]  There's video and we can roll it right there.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.600]  It's absolutely.
[23:55.600 --> 24:02.840]  And these people are panicking because Trump never said he should recuse himself and the
[24:02.840 --> 24:04.560]  argument as well.
[24:04.560 --> 24:05.880]  He's the separate attorney general.
[24:05.880 --> 24:06.880]  He can do what he wants.
[24:06.880 --> 24:09.080]  He should at least talk to the president about it.
[24:09.080 --> 24:14.200]  The president blew up, I heard about this for us, even the news from our sources and
[24:14.200 --> 24:16.320]  said, I'm leaving to Florida.
[24:16.320 --> 24:19.200]  You guys are a bunch of cowards.
[24:19.200 --> 24:21.400]  The only other person that was agreeing with him was Bannon.
[24:21.400 --> 24:25.280]  All the others were running around crapping themselves because, you know, Jared got his
[24:25.280 --> 24:28.400]  power from his parents and previous is a minion.
[24:28.400 --> 24:31.640]  And I'm not against Jared or any of these people, but give me a break.
[24:31.640 --> 24:35.720]  You're not going to make friends with the new world order.
[24:35.720 --> 24:41.560]  You're not going to give up and none of these people should even think twice about this.
[24:41.560 --> 24:44.840]  They need to join with the American people and be hardcore.
[24:44.840 --> 24:49.680]  If the head of the intelligence, if the head of the armed services committee meets with
[24:49.680 --> 24:55.400]  the Russian ambassador twice in 2016 publicly on the record and they get tasked later about
[24:55.400 --> 24:59.600]  it, did you meet as a campaign operative on the campaign with the Russians?
[24:59.600 --> 25:01.600]  No, we didn't.
[25:01.600 --> 25:07.120]  There's no lie there.
[25:07.120 --> 25:09.760]  I mean, it's time to be aggressive.
[25:09.760 --> 25:11.720]  It's time to be alpha male.
[25:11.720 --> 25:13.400]  It's time to rally the people.
[25:13.400 --> 25:20.360]  Or we're going to roll over to these cowards and I can't believe that Pelosi and Schumer
[25:20.360 --> 25:24.760]  and Michael Moore, these are the people we're up against and we can't beat them.
[25:24.760 --> 25:29.800]  We are beating them, but we have to get serious and coming up in the next segment.
[25:29.800 --> 25:41.560]  Our guest here, I had this idea yesterday morning because Jesse James sent me a text,
[25:41.560 --> 25:44.120]  great metal urges, motorcycle guy, everybody knows him.
[25:44.120 --> 25:45.120]  Media demonizing him.
[25:45.120 --> 25:46.120]  He's a good guy, but I know him well.
[25:46.120 --> 25:47.120]  What do you hear about the media?
[25:47.120 --> 25:48.120]  It's total BS.
[25:48.120 --> 25:49.760]  It's all the opposite.
[25:49.760 --> 25:55.280]  But long story short, I've known him for a long time and I thought, man, this guy, he's
[25:55.280 --> 26:02.160]  like the head in RA promotions guy now and they're looking for him to supercharge things,
[26:02.160 --> 26:06.120]  to bring him into the young generation.
[26:06.120 --> 26:08.960]  And he has people that love him all across America.
[26:08.960 --> 26:17.320]  He's had like of the top 10 reality shows, he's had three of the top 10, sold billions
[26:17.320 --> 26:18.320]  in merchandise.
[26:18.320 --> 26:19.320]  Oh, billions.
[26:19.320 --> 26:20.320]  He didn't brag about it.
[26:20.320 --> 26:24.520]  Billions with a B. He sold over $2 billion worth of merchandise in Walmart alone.
[26:24.520 --> 26:29.960]  The point is, Jesse James is a big wheel.
[26:29.960 --> 26:31.720]  TV isn't even worth it for him.
[26:31.720 --> 26:36.560]  He's a very down to earth guy and a lot of people respect him as just an entrepreneur,
[26:36.560 --> 26:41.720]  Americana, self-made.
[26:41.720 --> 26:44.640]  And I called him back and I said, you got to come on here and call for everybody to
[26:44.640 --> 26:47.840]  defend Trump and speak out for Trump because we're all thinking he's won.
[26:47.840 --> 26:48.840]  He's in there.
[26:48.840 --> 26:49.840]  That's not the case.
[26:49.840 --> 26:50.840]  The war is begun.
[26:50.840 --> 26:51.840]  He says, absolutely.
[26:51.840 --> 26:54.040]  I'll come in next Friday, pump it on the show.
[26:54.040 --> 26:58.920]  And I told him, I said, I'm going to call a lot of the most prominent war heroes and
[26:58.920 --> 27:01.200]  soldiers or I'm going to have my sources do it.
[27:01.200 --> 27:07.160]  And I didn't start calling until about six o'clock last night.
[27:07.160 --> 27:13.400]  And already we've got the most prominent names ready to fly here or come on today or the
[27:13.400 --> 27:17.360]  next few days and to speak out and defend the president, but they won't have to cover
[27:17.360 --> 27:20.440]  their faces like they did when they exposed Obama and said, we're not going to be Al Qaeda's
[27:20.440 --> 27:21.440]  Air Force.
[27:21.440 --> 27:25.360]  And that whole thing with Syria fell apart, thank God for our military saying no, the
[27:25.360 --> 27:32.720]  American people seeing it and calling Congress 101 for not going into Syria.
[27:32.720 --> 27:35.680]  The sleeping giant awoken, but it started with our military and it started here on
[27:35.680 --> 27:36.680]  the air.
[27:36.680 --> 27:38.160]  We began to call for the military to say no.
[27:38.160 --> 27:41.800]  We had whistleblowers on, Colonel Shaffer and Tosh Plumlee and others, and the military
[27:41.800 --> 27:45.520]  started posting on their Facebook, Instagram, you name it, images saying, I will not fight
[27:45.520 --> 27:46.880]  in Syria for Al Qaeda.
[27:46.880 --> 27:51.080]  Then Rand Paul came out and said, I'll not fight for Al Qaeda in Syria.
[27:51.080 --> 27:52.800]  They shouldn't be the Air Force.
[27:52.800 --> 27:58.400]  And then Ted Cruz did it and it morally brought them to their knees.
[27:58.400 --> 28:02.160]  When I have these ideas and it's super simple and not even that complex, it's just hiding
[28:02.160 --> 28:03.160]  in plain view.
[28:03.160 --> 28:09.200]  It's not like, hey, you know, Einstein, wow, or wow, no kidding, Sherlock.
[28:09.200 --> 28:10.560]  It hit me.
[28:10.560 --> 28:14.760]  And as soon as we started making these phone calls last night, we had people calling us
[28:14.760 --> 28:19.800]  back in mass and I mean, super prominent people, members of Congress, you name it, that are
[28:19.800 --> 28:24.520]  former military saying, let's do this to have the military come out for Trump.
[28:24.520 --> 28:26.680]  But this time it's their president.
[28:26.680 --> 28:29.920]  This time it's the law that they back to commander in chief.
[28:29.920 --> 28:34.800]  Every evidence he's trying to rebuild the country, the enemies of the nation know that.
[28:34.800 --> 28:38.360]  Our fight's the same as in England and France, where they're fighting globalism.
[28:38.360 --> 28:42.200]  They just unveiled the secret EU plan to take over the countries by force.
[28:42.200 --> 28:45.680]  The British defense minister came out and said, this is a military threat to the UK.
[28:45.680 --> 28:48.800]  It's now gotten to the EU is a military threat.
[28:48.800 --> 28:49.800]  Absolutely.
[28:49.800 --> 28:56.320]  It's an rogue out of control, new Soviet Union runs just like it, allied with Islam, even
[28:56.320 --> 29:01.040]  worse than the old Soviet Union, seriously.
[29:01.040 --> 29:02.400]  It's cancer.
[29:02.400 --> 29:03.400]  It's unpopular.
[29:03.400 --> 29:04.400]  It's a joke.
[29:04.400 --> 29:08.720]  It needs to be reformed now and America is finding its soul again.
[29:08.720 --> 29:14.800]  And so if the military puts out your signs, puts out your statements, like I am Donald
[29:14.800 --> 29:19.680]  Trump, kind of like I am Spartacus, or the enemies of America hate Donald Trump, or Donald
[29:19.680 --> 29:23.040]  Trump is America, the Democrats are traders.
[29:23.040 --> 29:24.040]  You see that everywhere.
[29:24.040 --> 29:29.080]  It shows the support and begins the rallying of the military and let's just face it.
[29:29.080 --> 29:30.080]  They may kill Trump.
[29:30.080 --> 29:31.080]  They're going to come after everybody.
[29:31.080 --> 29:32.080]  We're going to be in a civil war.
[29:32.080 --> 29:35.920]  So I don't want to have things get physical that we have to start preparing to fix things
[29:35.920 --> 29:37.280]  in the info war.
[29:37.280 --> 29:42.400]  But if it goes to a full on civil war, we're not going to have any choice.
[29:42.400 --> 29:43.880]  They're coming after everybody.
[29:43.880 --> 29:46.160]  They say they're physically coming after us.
[29:46.160 --> 29:49.680]  And if they want to fight, they're going to get one.
[29:49.680 --> 29:50.960]  We're on the march.
[29:50.960 --> 29:53.400]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.400 --> 30:00.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.240 --> 30:04.360]  The TSA is not satisfied with their current pat down procedure, so they are ramping them
[30:04.360 --> 30:05.920]  up to get more invasive.
[30:05.920 --> 30:09.720]  This is in response to a study that found weapons making it past security.
[30:09.720 --> 30:13.480]  The new pat down will be quote more intimate than before.
[30:13.480 --> 30:17.680]  While TSA screenings are clearly fallible, this new loving pat down procedure will make
[30:17.680 --> 30:22.100]  it less appealing for people who want to bypass the radiation scanners for health concerns,
[30:22.100 --> 30:26.200]  so they will just capitulate to the body scanners, which I'm sure will be ramped up and more
[30:26.200 --> 30:27.720]  intimate soon as well.
[30:27.720 --> 30:30.400]  Keep in mind, this applies to the random pat down.
[30:30.400 --> 30:35.600]  So this loose net is hardly an effective strategy unless you're looking to give more TSA agents
[30:35.600 --> 30:37.600]  freedom to grope your wife's chest.
[30:37.600 --> 30:42.320]  For the first time in human history, CNN's Angela Rye is right about something.
[30:42.320 --> 30:47.800]  As she wrote a piece titled, Dear TSA, the country is not safer after you grab vaginas.
[30:47.800 --> 30:49.880]  After an experience she had with the TSA.
[30:49.880 --> 30:51.880]  And that was before the new policy.
[30:51.880 --> 30:55.800]  Let's all unite behind molestation free air travel for all.
[30:55.800 --> 30:57.200]  Make flying great again.
[30:57.200 --> 31:00.040]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[31:00.040 --> 31:01.920]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[31:01.920 --> 31:03.960]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:03.960 --> 31:06.840]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:06.840 --> 31:12.840]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:12.840 --> 31:17.800]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[31:17.800 --> 31:22.760]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze, whether it's your home
[31:22.760 --> 31:27.880]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children to the best job
[31:27.880 --> 31:29.640]  you can to purify your air.
[31:29.640 --> 31:34.640]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:34.640 --> 31:37.640]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[31:37.640 --> 31:39.840]  The general public doesn't.
[31:39.840 --> 31:43.800]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:43.800 --> 31:47.400]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:47.400 --> 31:50.960]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[31:50.960 --> 31:54.160]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:54.160 --> 31:57.040]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.
[31:57.040 --> 32:06.480]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss
[32:06.480 --> 32:08.880]  to our modern diets of processed junk.
[32:08.880 --> 32:14.120]  We are now introducing caveman by infowarslife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[32:14.120 --> 32:20.280]  bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom and seven total primal super foods in a single
[32:20.280 --> 32:22.000]  great tasting formula.
[32:22.000 --> 32:26.080]  Caveman is those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that
[32:26.080 --> 32:30.600]  are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[32:30.600 --> 32:33.280]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[32:33.280 --> 32:38.280]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength
[32:38.280 --> 32:42.760]  from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces
[32:42.760 --> 32:43.840]  the blood for the body.
[32:43.840 --> 32:46.400]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[32:46.400 --> 32:50.760]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[32:50.760 --> 32:54.360]  to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[32:54.360 --> 32:58.920]  I know you're gonna want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself in infowarslife.com
[32:58.920 --> 33:01.920]  today.
[33:01.920 --> 33:09.520]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity they end up
[33:09.520 --> 33:11.520]  on top.
[33:11.520 --> 33:17.480]  The truth is humanity is coming down fast but we're miles above them on our journey
[33:17.480 --> 33:18.480]  to hell.
[33:18.480 --> 33:30.320]  Well, as you may have heard, President Trump is extremely pissed after discovering that
[33:30.320 --> 33:35.280]  Obama apparently used his surrogates in the Justice Department to tap his phones using
[33:35.280 --> 33:40.960]  a FISA warrant, a foreign intelligence surveillance act warrant which is extremely secret.
[33:40.960 --> 33:46.160]  Oh, not to mention most likely either the phones and emails of his staff, family and friends
[33:46.160 --> 33:47.160]  as well.
[33:47.160 --> 33:50.480]  Now, the liberal media is really putting in some overtime trying to spin this so let's
[33:50.480 --> 33:53.400]  cut through the BS to figure out exactly what happened.
[33:53.400 --> 33:57.960]  At this point in time many Democrats are either denying that there was a wire tap or really
[33:57.960 --> 34:02.680]  more of them are denying that Obama had directly ordered it and that if there was a wire tap
[34:02.680 --> 34:06.640]  it was the Justice Department and of course there would be no connection between them
[34:06.640 --> 34:08.640]  and Obama whatsoever.
[34:08.640 --> 34:12.040]  You know, the same Obama Justice Department that was headed up by Loretta Lynch who met
[34:12.040 --> 34:17.040]  secretly with Bill Clinton just before the investigation into Hillary was concluded.
[34:17.040 --> 34:20.720]  You know, the same Obama Justice Department that tapped the cell phone of Fox News Washington
[34:20.720 --> 34:26.080]  correspondent James Rosen under the Espionage Act to try to find out who his sources were
[34:26.080 --> 34:31.520]  as well as subpoenaed multiple phone records of Associated Press reporters.
[34:31.520 --> 34:35.480]  The same Obama Justice Department that openly admits that they tapped the personal cell
[34:35.480 --> 34:38.480]  phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
[34:38.480 --> 34:42.400]  You may recall that Obama openly admits that he launched an investigation to try to discover
[34:42.400 --> 34:46.160]  whether or not there was any connection between the Russians and the Trump campaign and their
[34:46.160 --> 34:48.760]  investigation revealed that there was nothing.
[34:48.760 --> 34:52.280]  So it really would be foolish to deny that Trump's phone was blocked and the phones of
[34:52.280 --> 34:54.320]  his closest staff as well.
[34:54.320 --> 34:57.440]  In fact, many in the intelligence community believe that the leaks that are coming out
[34:57.440 --> 35:02.840]  of the Trump administration are coming not from Trump's staff members but from rogue
[35:02.840 --> 35:08.240]  NSA officials who are actually tapping Trump's staff members' phones.
[35:08.240 --> 35:12.240]  It's been common knowledge for well over 10 years now that the intelligence community,
[35:12.240 --> 35:18.680]  the NSA, the FBI, the CIA, etc. can tap people's phones with just a few clicks on a computer.
[35:18.680 --> 35:24.080]  Not only just tapping phone calls but actually activate the microphone in your phone or one
[35:24.080 --> 35:28.000]  of them, there's multiple microphones in your phones as you probably know, can remotely
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.840]  activate those mics and then the phone is literally a bug.
[35:32.840 --> 35:35.240]  It doesn't even matter if the phone is off.
[35:35.240 --> 35:40.360]  It can still be remotely activated and have the microphone or one of the microphones
[35:40.360 --> 35:44.040]  turned on, which is then a multi-directional bug.
[35:44.040 --> 35:47.760]  I mean, this is why these lead-covered cases for cell phones are becoming more and more
[35:47.760 --> 35:52.520]  popular because so many people know now that your phone can just be activated remotely
[35:52.520 --> 35:57.840]  and used as a bug, again, even if the phone is powered down and really the only way to
[35:57.840 --> 36:02.640]  stop that is to put it in a lead case so that there's no signals being transmitted to or
[36:02.640 --> 36:03.640]  from the phone.
[36:03.640 --> 36:07.760]  I mean, we're living in such an Orwellian surveillance society that even James Comey,
[36:07.760 --> 36:13.480]  the head of the FBI, admits that he covers up the video camera on his laptop.
[36:13.480 --> 36:17.880]  For over 10 years, I've been covering up the webcam on my laptop because it's now common
[36:17.880 --> 36:23.080]  knowledge that it's very easy to tap into, but 10, 12 years ago, something like that
[36:23.080 --> 36:27.600]  was seen as so far-fetched that when one of my coworkers at my former day job saw what
[36:27.600 --> 36:29.840]  I was doing, he asked, he's like, oh, what is this?
[36:29.840 --> 36:30.840]  You got tape over the camera?
[36:30.840 --> 36:33.800]  He's like, you think that someone's going to be spying on you?
[36:33.800 --> 36:39.360]  And now here, fast forward like 12 years later, it's common knowledge and pretty much everybody
[36:39.360 --> 36:40.360]  does that.
[36:40.360 --> 36:44.680]  Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg goes even a step further to try to prevent people
[36:44.680 --> 36:48.200]  from spying on him, which he does something that's actually quite clever.
[36:48.200 --> 36:54.160]  He plugs into the microphone jack on his laptop, a 2.5 millimeter, like a headphone jack or
[36:54.160 --> 36:58.800]  a microphone jack that is then cut off so that the computer identifies that there's
[36:58.800 --> 37:04.640]  an external microphone so that if someone is tapping into the microphone on his computer,
[37:04.640 --> 37:09.280]  it's not going to be getting any audio because the computer is set up to use the external
[37:09.280 --> 37:10.440]  microphone.
[37:10.440 --> 37:11.440]  But guess what?
[37:11.440 --> 37:13.840]  The cord is cut and there is no microphone.
[37:13.840 --> 37:17.160]  And these liberal lunatics continue to see Russians around every corner and literally
[37:17.160 --> 37:22.520]  think that Trump is a Russian-Mantarian candidate placed in the White House by the Kremlin.
[37:22.520 --> 37:26.360]  But his staff has been caught meeting with the Russians, they say.
[37:26.360 --> 37:28.680]  Jeff Sessions was a member of Congress.
[37:28.680 --> 37:34.040]  He met with a Russian ambassador in his office, as do many members of Congress.
[37:34.040 --> 37:37.560]  He didn't meet with him in some underground parking garage.
[37:37.560 --> 37:41.600]  The meeting is probably marked on his calendar, which is public record.
[37:41.600 --> 37:44.440]  Right there, met with Russian ambassador.
[37:44.440 --> 37:46.440]  No big secret here.
[37:46.440 --> 37:49.440]  Someone just asked Nancy Pelosi, well, have you ever met with a Russian ambassador?
[37:49.440 --> 37:53.960]  And she was just like stunned, she's like, uh, uh, uh, uh, of course she has.
[37:53.960 --> 37:58.680]  It's not some big conspiracy that the Russian ambassador meets with American congressmen.
[37:58.680 --> 37:59.680]  That's what they do.
[37:59.680 --> 38:02.680]  So it's going to be interesting to see how this wiretapping scandal unfolds, because
[38:02.680 --> 38:06.760]  thankfully we have a president who's not going to sit down and take any crap when treasonous
[38:06.760 --> 38:10.480]  members of the deep state conspire to try to bring him down.
[38:10.480 --> 38:21.400]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's
[38:21.400 --> 38:28.400]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[38:28.400 --> 38:38.920]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[38:38.920 --> 38:43.560]  Timothy Reigns and Quentin Carter are guest in studio the first to kick off this new initiative
[38:43.560 --> 38:44.560]  with us.
[38:44.560 --> 38:48.000]  We're going to get a lot of other people obviously in studio and on air, but I just had this
[38:48.000 --> 38:53.360]  idea yesterday talking to Q and to Jesse James and I said, we really ought to get the patriots
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.480]  to this country, not just the motorcycle clubs and people that, you know, still believe the
[38:57.480 --> 39:02.920]  second amendment private property, but the veterans who've been targeted by the Democrats,
[39:02.920 --> 39:09.040]  by the globalist, uh, when we've got the reports, I've shown them on air where DHS domestic
[39:09.040 --> 39:15.320]  terror warning, you know, anger is the GOP, uh, where they said that we stand by veterans
[39:15.320 --> 39:20.600]  being the number one terror threatened America with no evidence, no metrics, no nothing, but
[39:20.600 --> 39:26.560]  of course if you're globalist that have hijacked the country, you're threatened by the veterans.
[39:26.560 --> 39:28.880]  So this is becoming a very, very serious situation.
[39:28.880 --> 39:33.440]  You have all the fake intelligence reports, uh, that they now admit are fake.
[39:33.440 --> 39:36.360]  The house intelligence committee chairman said, we've seen it all.
[39:36.360 --> 39:39.560]  There's not even phone calls to the Russians, but Trump was under surveillance.
[39:39.560 --> 39:43.000]  George W. Bush's former attorney general has come out and said, no, we've seen the evidence.
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.520]  They were under total surveillance during the campaign and during the transition and
[39:46.520 --> 39:51.520]  probably still, uh, and then we've also got former high level CIA folks coming out and
[39:51.520 --> 39:58.000]  saying, uh, former CIA analyst, Obama gave green light for NSA CIA to sabotage Trump.
[39:58.000 --> 40:04.240]  So Trump is now coming out and saying, you know what, I want all of it released to Congress,
[40:04.240 --> 40:10.240]  release all our transcripts, everything of the non-existent wiretapping.
[40:10.240 --> 40:13.360]  That's how dumb they think you are as months ago.
[40:13.360 --> 40:18.680]  They say they're engaged in all the surveillance and then they come out in the news and say,
[40:18.680 --> 40:19.680]  it's preposterous.
[40:19.680 --> 40:20.920]  It's asinine.
[40:20.920 --> 40:23.800]  Trump is ret, why would he say we're spying on him?
[40:23.800 --> 40:28.120]  So I had the idea along with these guys and of course I've known Tim for a while as well.
[40:28.120 --> 40:34.760]  He's just had him on air with us to just say, look, it seems like common sense spontaneously
[40:34.760 --> 40:39.840]  veterans were calling in on our show in 2013 and put the articles up on screen and they
[40:39.840 --> 40:41.960]  were saying, this is Al Qaeda.
[40:41.960 --> 40:43.920]  This is Wahhabist groups.
[40:43.920 --> 40:44.920]  We're helping in Syria.
[40:44.920 --> 40:45.920]  It's morally wrong.
[40:45.920 --> 40:48.520]  They're killing Christians by the tens of thousands every month.
[40:48.520 --> 40:54.160]  And I had CIA contractors on like Tosh Plumlee, I had Colonel Shaffer on about Benghazi right
[40:54.160 --> 40:55.960]  after it happened with exactly what happened.
[40:55.960 --> 40:59.240]  I mean, all sorts of hell broke loose from that.
[40:59.240 --> 41:03.760]  And the fact is I'm not bragging, I'm letting you know, we've been the epicenter of this
[41:03.760 --> 41:08.360]  already with our audience so we can do this together.
[41:08.360 --> 41:10.920]  If you take actions like everything else we've done, I'm going to turn it over to these
[41:10.920 --> 41:14.920]  guys for the next 45 minutes.
[41:14.920 --> 41:18.960]  But it started with folks who were listening to our show sending us photos of themselves
[41:18.960 --> 41:23.520]  in uniform, but covering their faces because it wasn't a real commander in chief then saying
[41:23.520 --> 41:29.920]  I did not join the Navy to fight for Al Qaeda in the Syrian civil war on and on and on.
[41:29.920 --> 41:32.800]  U.S. military does not want to fight for Al Qaeda.
[41:32.800 --> 41:38.440]  Even killers in Syria, September 2, 2013.
[41:38.440 --> 41:44.200]  So Info Wars just covered this without me even calling for veterans to stand up.
[41:44.200 --> 41:47.840]  They were suddenly in active duty with a group that were speaking out and taking action
[41:47.840 --> 41:51.200]  on Facebook, Twitter, Google, and they were being blocked.
[41:51.200 --> 41:53.560]  But it still didn't stop the information from spreading.
[41:53.560 --> 41:56.720]  But you know, once one of their photos got like a million viewers, they'd knock it down,
[41:56.720 --> 41:57.720]  they'd block it.
[41:57.720 --> 41:58.720]  But it didn't matter.
[41:58.720 --> 42:00.240]  More people just kept fighting back.
[42:00.240 --> 42:07.000]  So they were getting a hundred to one phone calls against the Syrian war for Saudi Arabia.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.640]  And that's what turned the tide on that.
[42:08.640 --> 42:12.120]  And then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs went, Dempsey, and told Obama on a Saturday
[42:12.120 --> 42:13.120]  night, we're not bombing tomorrow.
[42:13.120 --> 42:16.120]  There's going to be a full mutiny because what you're doing is illegal.
[42:16.120 --> 42:21.520]  And of course, this later, our government, Obama, had overthrown Libya.
[42:21.520 --> 42:27.200]  They'd overthrown our ally, Egypt, and actually put Wahhabist in, murdering people in mass,
[42:27.200 --> 42:28.520]  blowing up 200-plus churches.
[42:28.520 --> 42:32.880]  CNN was like, it's wonderful what's happening in Anderson Cooper.
[42:32.880 --> 42:36.160]  This is our government at that time, allied with radical Islam.
[42:36.160 --> 42:38.800]  I hear that 10 years ago from people that were really smart, and I thought they were
[42:38.800 --> 42:39.800]  crazy.
[42:39.800 --> 42:40.800]  I mean, it really happened.
[42:40.800 --> 42:45.000]  Then the documents came out that Obama was funding the Muslim Brotherhood.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.760]  Now we learned he gave $3 billion of taxpayer money illegally.
[42:47.760 --> 42:49.280]  This just broke last week.
[42:49.280 --> 42:54.240]  Fox News, CNN had to report on it and said, oh, big deal, directly to these Black Lives
[42:54.240 --> 42:55.840]  Matter and activist groups.
[42:55.840 --> 43:01.160]  $3 billion, the money they stole from fines from big banks and then gave to them.
[43:01.160 --> 43:04.120]  So this is a criminal attempt to overthrow our republic.
[43:04.120 --> 43:09.960]  If you ever wanted to clear cut time to stand up for the country and just speak out, this
[43:09.960 --> 43:11.600]  is the time.
[43:11.600 --> 43:15.360]  Because these people are trying to say, our presidents are Russian agent with zero evidence.
[43:15.360 --> 43:18.000]  The intelligence committee has already said there's nothing there.
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.520]  And now there's nothing there, they say, well, we never wiretapped, we never said any of
[43:23.520 --> 43:24.520]  this.
[43:24.520 --> 43:25.520]  Oh, really?
[43:25.520 --> 43:29.560]  There are hundreds and hundreds of articles a day that came out for a month.
[43:29.560 --> 43:37.800]  So it's all unfolding right now, and the globalists love, as they sell America out, use our military
[43:37.800 --> 43:38.800]  to expand their power.
[43:38.800 --> 43:44.200]  A ton of homicides love veterans, but when their actions, remember, in their actions they
[43:44.200 --> 43:49.080]  hate the veterans because they can do people on average, they're not domesticated.
[43:49.080 --> 43:51.760]  The Politano stands by controversial report.
[43:51.760 --> 43:53.960]  Remember this, Washington Times?
[43:53.960 --> 43:57.360]  Remember they came out, we got the secret document from Homeland Security, I got it
[43:57.360 --> 43:59.360]  from federal marshals.
[43:59.360 --> 44:04.200]  For a week, people said it must be fake, saying veterans are the number one threat, returning
[44:04.200 --> 44:08.680]  veterans are number one, veterans are number two, gun owners are number three, Christians
[44:08.680 --> 44:10.840]  are number four, people couldn't believe it.
[44:10.840 --> 44:14.040]  And then all of a sudden, everybody started leaking them everywhere going, state police
[44:14.040 --> 44:18.000]  everywhere got the federal report, they said, no, it's real, but Alex Jones put out as real.
[44:18.000 --> 44:22.480]  Again, I'm not taking credit, we get the info, we put it out, I mean, I called the number
[44:22.480 --> 44:23.480]  on it.
[44:23.480 --> 44:27.280]  I said, how do you have that?
[44:27.280 --> 44:28.280]  Do not cover that.
[44:28.280 --> 44:30.000]  And I said, screw you, I've already covered it.
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.880]  I said, I haven't authenticated this, but I just authenticated it with you.
[44:33.880 --> 44:34.880]  And then she had to respond.
[44:34.880 --> 44:41.200]  She stood by it saying veterans, the lowest crime rate out there, patriots are the number
[44:41.200 --> 44:42.200]  one threat.
[44:42.200 --> 44:44.800]  Well, the threat to the globalist that are high-tech in the country, folks, I have the
[44:44.800 --> 44:48.200]  British head of the British Ministry of Defense coming out yesterday, and we're gonna go to
[44:48.200 --> 44:49.200]  our guest here.
[44:49.200 --> 44:55.920]  Let me set the table, coming out yesterday in a speech saying the EU is deploying a secret
[44:55.920 --> 45:00.520]  army and is trying to get laws passed to turn our militaries over to them.
[45:00.520 --> 45:03.040]  This is a military threat to the UK.
[45:03.040 --> 45:07.520]  That's because the EU is a criminal organization with socialists and globalists and communist
[45:07.520 --> 45:12.640]  aims that opened itself up to 5 million Islamists, 80% of military aged men.
[45:12.640 --> 45:13.760]  They ran the whole program.
[45:13.760 --> 45:15.320]  This is their shadow army.
[45:15.320 --> 45:16.600]  This is their takeover.
[45:16.600 --> 45:18.120]  It's really happening.
[45:18.120 --> 45:19.600]  They're really that crazy.
[45:19.600 --> 45:21.600]  They think you're really that asleep.
[45:21.600 --> 45:25.880]  So even in the UK, we're gonna play this clip coming up and start the next hour.
[45:25.880 --> 45:29.720]  Even in the UK, they're saying secret army to take over.
[45:29.720 --> 45:31.920]  What the hell?
[45:31.920 --> 45:35.480]  Because the EU is crazy enough to admit they're deploying this army, but said it's secret.
[45:35.480 --> 45:37.720]  Well, of course, the British got all the intelligence on it.
[45:37.720 --> 45:43.280]  It's crazy, as if a bunch of socialist French and Germans are gonna take over the world.
[45:43.280 --> 45:44.840]  Give me a break.
[45:44.840 --> 45:50.080]  So our country's in deep trouble because we've been so nice.
[45:50.080 --> 45:51.320]  They've taken it for weakness.
[45:51.320 --> 45:54.720]  And now they think that they're in every major newspaper saying kill the president, overthrow
[45:54.720 --> 45:56.760]  him, impeach him.
[45:56.760 --> 46:01.640]  They're all over the place lying because Trump actually does care about American people and
[46:01.640 --> 46:06.720]  workers and veterans and coal miners is actually doing something day one, the biggest stock
[46:06.720 --> 46:13.200]  market we've had in our history, $3 trillion added in the last two months, the best small
[46:13.200 --> 46:17.760]  business numbers coming in since 1984, took Reagan three years to get there.
[46:17.760 --> 46:19.400]  Just taking the foot off our neck.
[46:19.400 --> 46:22.240]  That's all Trump's doing.
[46:22.240 --> 46:24.360]  Our government sold us out to special entrants.
[46:24.360 --> 46:27.480]  They gave them our weapons, everything.
[46:27.480 --> 46:29.760]  So I'm done ranting about this.
[46:29.760 --> 46:32.840]  I have scripted this with Tim or Quentin.
[46:32.840 --> 46:35.480]  I know you guys have made a lot of phone calls, a lot of really great people.
[46:35.480 --> 46:38.880]  Some of the top, you know, heroes and soldiers out there understand as soon as they heard
[46:38.880 --> 46:40.640]  the call, they go, absolutely.
[46:40.640 --> 46:41.640]  We're already there.
[46:41.640 --> 46:44.520]  We've got somebody to, you know, something to catalyze.
[46:44.520 --> 46:47.280]  But what we're facing, you cannot hype this up enough.
[46:47.280 --> 46:49.600]  This is the second American revolution.
[46:49.600 --> 46:50.600]  This is it.
[46:50.600 --> 46:54.600]  But not against King George this time, but against a multinational globalist group whose
[46:54.600 --> 46:55.600]  anti-free market.
[46:55.600 --> 46:57.720]  We're not against big corporations that are rich.
[46:57.720 --> 46:58.720]  That's wonderful.
[46:58.720 --> 47:03.920]  As long as they want small people to have a chance and to set up a world that produces
[47:03.920 --> 47:07.880]  freedom, that doesn't turn us over to Islam.
[47:07.880 --> 47:09.520]  All right.
[47:09.520 --> 47:12.960]  So Tim and Q, you guys, we haven't scripted what we're going to talk about here is from
[47:12.960 --> 47:16.440]  the heart, where, you know, where we're at, what other folks you're talking to are saying,
[47:16.440 --> 47:20.080]  where this is going, because if listeners and viewers, we're going to skip this break
[47:20.080 --> 47:21.080]  to coming up.
[47:21.080 --> 47:26.880]  So I've been going here, if the viewers take their, whatever their comment is, hold up a
[47:26.880 --> 47:31.240]  sign in uniform, active duty, you're allowed as active duty to say support the president.
[47:31.240 --> 47:32.920]  You're supposed to underlaw, aren't you?
[47:32.920 --> 47:33.920]  To do this.
[47:33.920 --> 47:34.920]  It's so simple.
[47:34.920 --> 47:35.920]  Just be Americans.
[47:35.920 --> 47:36.920]  Just have solidarity.
[47:36.920 --> 47:41.200]  He's like Chuck Schumer and Pelosi and all of them understand and Michael Moore and we're
[47:41.200 --> 47:42.720]  not putting up with it.
[47:42.720 --> 47:45.520]  So again, we have the famous photos from three years ago, people saying, I'm not going to
[47:45.520 --> 47:47.200]  fight for al-Qaeda in Syria.
[47:47.200 --> 47:49.480]  We've just changed them to an example of what I would do.
[47:49.480 --> 47:52.600]  Donald Trump is my president.
[47:52.600 --> 47:53.840]  I am Donald Trump.
[47:53.840 --> 47:58.760]  If you all do this on Facebook, Instagram, wherever, call into talk radio, wherever,
[47:58.760 --> 48:04.360]  go speak at city council, we need you, America respects you and the country's under attack
[48:04.360 --> 48:05.520]  by globalists.
[48:05.520 --> 48:07.600]  This is where you're needed in the Republic.
[48:07.600 --> 48:08.600]  This is it.
[48:08.600 --> 48:09.600]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[48:09.600 --> 48:10.600]  All right, guys, take over.
[48:10.600 --> 48:11.600]  Tim.
[48:11.600 --> 48:17.000]  Exactly what you said, you know, it's, it's pretty upsetting to actually see the way our
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.360]  country's actually going right now.
[48:19.360 --> 48:22.000]  Not supporting the president, the commander in chief, and that's exactly what we need
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.000]  to do.
[48:23.000 --> 48:28.000]  Regardless of, you know, who you are or whatever you voted on this or that, it doesn't matter
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.040]  anymore because he's been elected president.
[48:30.040 --> 48:32.560]  Now that he is president, we need to stand behind him.
[48:32.560 --> 48:36.840]  We need to stand together and we need to support him in every way he takes this country because
[48:36.840 --> 48:39.160]  for the next four years, that's exactly what's going to happen.
[48:39.160 --> 48:40.160]  Exactly.
[48:40.160 --> 48:44.200]  You know, and several years ago we had a bunch of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, stuff
[48:44.200 --> 48:50.160]  like that, stand up and take pictures that they wouldn't basically partake in what would
[48:50.160 --> 48:54.640]  be a war or illegal actions.
[48:54.640 --> 48:55.720]  We want you to do the same thing.
[48:55.720 --> 48:56.800]  This is a call to action.
[48:56.800 --> 48:57.800]  It's time to stand up.
[48:57.800 --> 48:59.600]  It's time to do the right thing.
[48:59.600 --> 49:02.800]  Write that same sign, draw that same picture, whatever it is, but this time, don't hide
[49:02.800 --> 49:03.800]  your face.
[49:03.800 --> 49:06.480]  Show the world who you are and that you're proud.
[49:06.480 --> 49:09.040]  We understand Tim was in the Marines, I was in the Army.
[49:09.040 --> 49:13.040]  There are certain things that on your uniform you don't want to show and we fully understand
[49:13.040 --> 49:14.040]  that.
[49:14.040 --> 49:18.200]  We don't want anyone to get in trouble for what they do, but there's nothing wrong with
[49:18.200 --> 49:19.800]  supporting the commander in chief.
[49:19.800 --> 49:22.960]  You know, the UCMJ, all those things, there's nothing wrong.
[49:22.960 --> 49:29.480]  There's nothing unlawful about basically saying that you support the man who supports us.
[49:29.480 --> 49:31.240]  Trump has been great to veterans.
[49:31.240 --> 49:34.560]  He has been great to the United States of America as a whole.
[49:34.560 --> 49:39.680]  And I wholeheartedly believe that his mission is to make this place great again.
[49:39.680 --> 49:47.000]  And so far, in just 45 days or whatever it is, he's made astronomical changes for the
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  betterment of us.
[49:48.000 --> 49:49.000]  That's why they're so scared.
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.560]  That's exactly why they're scared.
[49:50.560 --> 49:53.760]  They don't want to see anyone win.
[49:53.760 --> 49:54.760]  Basically they feel...
[49:54.760 --> 49:55.760]  That's it.
[49:55.760 --> 49:57.400]  They're the only people that are supposed to win because they run everything.
[49:57.400 --> 50:03.800]  The only way that they can feel empowered is to divide everyone, to control them, to
[50:03.800 --> 50:08.360]  make sure they're poor, to make sure they're uneducated, to make sure they don't have jobs.
[50:08.360 --> 50:10.280]  I mean, it's a basic tactic.
[50:10.280 --> 50:11.280]  We understand that.
[50:11.280 --> 50:13.400]  You know, and it's just like we talked about yesterday.
[50:13.400 --> 50:18.400]  It's one of the just most idiotic ideas that these people have is whenever they're, you
[50:18.400 --> 50:23.120]  know, like we said, like you said, the president of the United States, he's the pilot.
[50:23.120 --> 50:27.600]  We're flying on an airplane and you have people that want him to crash and burn.
[50:27.600 --> 50:28.600]  But why?
[50:28.600 --> 50:29.600]  We're all...
[50:29.600 --> 50:32.560]  Oh, Bloomberg and others have said, we want the economy to fail.
[50:32.560 --> 50:36.360]  Goldman Sachs is telling people dump their stocks and things to hurt Trump.
[50:36.360 --> 50:39.880]  And they've made record money since he's been in, that they want control.
[50:39.880 --> 50:40.880]  Right.
[50:40.880 --> 50:44.120]  But they have enough money that they can take money, set it aside, do other things with
[50:44.120 --> 50:46.640]  it, put it in foreign markets and things like that.
[50:46.640 --> 50:50.240]  So if our economy crashes, it doesn't leave them poor.
[50:50.240 --> 50:51.680]  The ultra-rich will never be.
[50:51.680 --> 50:52.680]  That's right.
[50:52.680 --> 50:53.680]  That's fair.
[50:53.680 --> 50:56.560]  I mean, all I'm saying is, I've studied history, what's going on is treasonous.
[50:56.560 --> 50:59.960]  And I'm not calling for some fascist deal.
[50:59.960 --> 51:04.560]  They're already doing this saying all over the news, kill the president, crash the economy,
[51:04.560 --> 51:05.560]  burn down cities.
[51:05.560 --> 51:08.840]  And at a certain point, he has a responsibility to start going after these people.
[51:08.840 --> 51:10.520]  No, he definitely should.
[51:10.520 --> 51:13.360]  And, you know, it's our responsibility and now that we're back home, you know, for the
[51:13.360 --> 51:16.080]  veterans that are back home, they're not serving overseas anymore.
[51:16.080 --> 51:20.560]  You know, it's our responsibility to step together and support the president, you know,
[51:20.560 --> 51:23.360]  give him exactly what he needs in that support.
[51:23.360 --> 51:26.480]  You know, you don't have to necessarily agree with everything that he says.
[51:26.480 --> 51:29.960]  But again, in the end of the day, he's the president of the United States.
[51:29.960 --> 51:31.680]  The country as a whole stood up and voted.
[51:31.680 --> 51:35.240]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[51:35.240 --> 51:39.320]  We've sat back and took it on the chin for eight solid years.
[51:39.320 --> 51:40.320]  We didn't whine.
[51:40.320 --> 51:41.320]  We didn't complain.
[51:41.320 --> 51:42.320]  We didn't protest.
[51:42.320 --> 51:44.600]  We didn't go up and beat up people.
[51:44.600 --> 51:50.280]  You know, veterans didn't go out and attack the LGBT community or anyone else because
[51:50.280 --> 51:51.360]  that's not our style.
[51:51.360 --> 51:53.120]  We are not aggressors.
[51:53.120 --> 51:54.120]  We're protectors.
[51:54.120 --> 51:55.400]  It's how it works.
[51:55.400 --> 52:00.840]  So now that we've sat back, we've done eight years of this, it's our turn.
[52:00.840 --> 52:02.600]  We expect the same thing.
[52:02.600 --> 52:05.280]  You don't have to necessarily agree with what he has to say.
[52:05.280 --> 52:08.600]  You don't have to wholeheartedly believe in his message.
[52:08.600 --> 52:12.080]  But what you do have to do is stop trying to derail the train.
[52:12.080 --> 52:14.640]  We're all trying to go in the same direction.
[52:14.640 --> 52:19.400]  We're all trying to benefit from this, make it better.
[52:19.400 --> 52:25.080]  And that's better education, that's better jobs, that's better homeland security.
[52:25.080 --> 52:26.760]  There's all kinds of things that encompass it.
[52:26.760 --> 52:34.040]  I mean, Trump 25 billion to black colleges in his first month and the Democrats did four
[52:34.040 --> 52:35.040]  billion in eight years.
[52:35.040 --> 52:37.040]  The point is the media didn't even cover it.
[52:37.040 --> 52:38.040]  None whatsoever.
[52:38.040 --> 52:39.040]  But why would they?
[52:39.040 --> 52:40.040]  It's against their agenda.
[52:40.040 --> 52:45.920]  Why would they let everyone know that Trump the racist gave any money to black college?
[52:45.920 --> 52:47.360]  And they have no proof.
[52:47.360 --> 52:50.120]  And getting back to this, I'm sure you guys remember this, we've talked about it.
[52:50.120 --> 52:54.040]  Remember when Obama said the number one threats veterans and returning veterans and gun owners?
[52:54.040 --> 52:55.200]  Trump reversed that.
[52:55.200 --> 52:58.920]  Trump team once anti-terror program, only target radical Islam, he actually did the
[52:58.920 --> 53:02.760]  order and told him to stop saying the main threats gun owners and veterans.
[53:02.760 --> 53:05.360]  But is radical Islam in the country?
[53:05.360 --> 53:07.440]  Trump delisted the veterans as the enemy.
[53:07.440 --> 53:11.520]  Yeah, there was a big movement in the veteran community for quite a while when they talked
[53:11.520 --> 53:16.800]  about homegrown terrorists, basically talking about how, you know, the veterans who came
[53:16.800 --> 53:23.080]  home from the war are the biggest threat to the United States that they are.
[53:23.080 --> 53:25.120]  We need armored vehicles for the veterans.
[53:25.120 --> 53:28.640]  Because you don't know, because they're unstable, because they have post-traumatic stress, because
[53:28.640 --> 53:32.200]  of all this other crazy bullshit that they wanted to do.
[53:32.200 --> 53:37.560]  So what they basically did was put doubt in the mind of those veterans who came home,
[53:37.560 --> 53:38.560]  who are having a hard time.
[53:38.560 --> 53:40.600]  It was mentioned to moralize them so they can commit suicide.
[53:40.600 --> 53:41.600]  That's exactly.
[53:41.600 --> 53:42.600]  Yeah, they did part of the movement.
[53:42.600 --> 53:44.520]  I talked to a lot of people about that too.
[53:44.520 --> 53:47.920]  It's just one of those things where when they started saying that stuff and there were guys
[53:47.920 --> 53:52.600]  that had, you know, did have actual problems with PTSD and needed to come out and get help,
[53:52.600 --> 53:55.680]  they were afraid to because they thought they had this thought in the back of their mind
[53:55.680 --> 53:59.040]  that they would actually get put on these lists that you're talking about.
[53:59.040 --> 54:03.280]  And so, you know, a lot of them were framed from going out and asking for help because
[54:03.280 --> 54:06.240]  they were afraid of some of the other stuff that they might be looked at differently.
[54:06.240 --> 54:07.240]  It's just stigma.
[54:07.240 --> 54:09.120]  They were dehumanizing the veterans, exactly.
[54:09.120 --> 54:12.160]  And a lot of it has to do also with, you know, the different backgrounds that guys
[54:12.160 --> 54:17.280]  have, whether you're a force recombinant or a ranger or special forces, whatever it is,
[54:17.280 --> 54:19.880]  or even a truck driver, whatever.
[54:19.880 --> 54:25.440]  A lot of those guys are afraid to be put on lists based wholly on their experience, based
[54:25.440 --> 54:27.120]  on their resume, based on their bio.
[54:27.120 --> 54:28.720]  Well, here's the news.
[54:28.720 --> 54:32.360]  Everybody's on a list who has come back now and everybody has to understand this is the
[54:32.360 --> 54:33.560]  battle for the republic.
[54:33.560 --> 54:34.880]  We claim you want a real president.
[54:34.880 --> 54:36.560]  He's totally delivered.
[54:36.560 --> 54:40.160]  He's under total attack by every bad group there is, which is even more proof.
[54:40.160 --> 54:44.800]  And this is the war for the country, so they plan to physically try to kill the president
[54:44.800 --> 54:46.080]  or shut him down or remove him.
[54:46.080 --> 54:49.960]  And then they've openly announced all this horrible stuff they want to do to the country
[54:49.960 --> 54:53.520]  and just, I mean, it's total social engineering.
[54:53.520 --> 54:57.680]  So if the veterans simply, again, what are some ideas of things veterans can do?
[54:57.680 --> 55:01.400]  Obviously, they can take photos with statements, I'm with Trump or those that, you know, hate
[55:01.400 --> 55:05.800]  Trump or enemies of America or, you know, the Democrats are, you know, globalist operatives,
[55:05.800 --> 55:10.480]  you know, not Trump or the enemy power as globalist or Americanism, not globalism.
[55:10.480 --> 55:11.480]  I support Trump.
[55:11.480 --> 55:15.240]  I mean, whatever the message is, put it out, we'll post them to M4 Wars, we'll retweet
[55:15.240 --> 55:18.880]  them, we'll Facebook them, we'll put articles out that I guarantee you.
[55:18.880 --> 55:23.080]  Once this gets big, drudge a link to and the president will see it and also give him support
[55:23.080 --> 55:27.920]  because here's the thing, Trump overall is winning and we're winning right now.
[55:27.920 --> 55:31.960]  But the enemy is emboldened and I'll say the biggest problem.
[55:31.960 --> 55:34.000]  Trump is completely committed, doesn't care.
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.080]  He's very fatalistic about all this, he's doing the right thing, he doesn't care.
[55:37.080 --> 55:41.560]  I mean, he's really sees himself as a revolutionary and that's why they even put out CIA reports
[55:41.560 --> 55:45.040]  that have leaked to Congress and leaked to public affairs magazine and things where they
[55:45.040 --> 55:48.600]  go, okay, Trump's for real, he really believes he's going to save America and do all this
[55:48.600 --> 55:51.040]  and that's why he's super dangerous.
[55:51.040 --> 55:53.680]  So they've gotten past the racist all this other crap, they just say, oh no, this guy
[55:53.680 --> 55:57.280]  actually wants to devolve power of the states, he really wants to do this, we've got to stop
[55:57.280 --> 55:58.280]  him.
[55:58.280 --> 56:01.760]  So they're committed, the war, it just started people and it's not like, oh, there's work
[56:01.760 --> 56:02.760]  I've got to do.
[56:02.760 --> 56:06.720]  It's fighting, it's honored to be alive when the country was on a nice edge about to really
[56:06.720 --> 56:11.200]  end and we got a last gasp here that if we take advantage of it, it can be a whole new
[56:11.200 --> 56:14.720]  lease on life and all the world people are saying no to globalism.
[56:14.720 --> 56:18.400]  We took our first step by actually going to the polls and speaking our mind, there were
[56:18.400 --> 56:21.680]  a lot of fake polls, there were a lot of people saying that Trump has no chance.
[56:21.680 --> 56:23.360]  And they bucked the polls.
[56:23.360 --> 56:27.080]  And that's exactly what happened, we just didn't fall for their rhetoric.
[56:27.080 --> 56:34.760]  We went to the polls, we all voted, men, women, gay, straight, veterans, non-veterans, everybody
[56:34.760 --> 56:35.760]  went out and voted.
[56:35.760 --> 56:36.760]  Everyone had their chance.
[56:36.760 --> 56:37.760]  For prosperity.
[56:37.760 --> 56:38.760]  With their mind, right.
[56:38.760 --> 56:41.080]  And now it's super simple.
[56:41.080 --> 56:45.160]  We took the first step, the next step is now wholeheartedly supporting the man who's in
[56:45.160 --> 56:46.160]  charge.
[56:46.160 --> 56:52.560]  Regardless of the past, today is new, tomorrow is new, all we want to do is do better from
[56:52.560 --> 56:53.560]  this point forward.
[56:53.560 --> 56:58.760]  Well, and it's just like we, you know, I started overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan and during
[56:58.760 --> 57:03.840]  that time, you know, Obama's eight-year, you know, reign or presidential, whatever.
[57:03.840 --> 57:08.280]  You know, I supported him wholeheartedly every step of the way.
[57:08.280 --> 57:11.760]  I might not have agreed with everything that he did, but regardless, he was the commander
[57:11.760 --> 57:13.520]  in chief and so I did what he wanted.
[57:13.520 --> 57:18.880]  But now I actually see a prison that I believe in and, you know, now it's our turn to step
[57:18.880 --> 57:23.000]  together the polls and voting and us getting him into office was just the first step.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.040]  Now the second step to secure our future for a better future.
[57:26.040 --> 57:27.040]  We just need to come together.
[57:27.040 --> 57:33.000]  The veterans need to stand up and, you know, actually go out on air or social media and
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.200]  then just say that they do support Trump.
[57:35.200 --> 57:38.960]  That's right because all the scumbags, I mean, I've seen Schumer have press conferences
[57:38.960 --> 57:41.280]  about how veterans are dangerous and need to be watched.
[57:41.280 --> 57:43.720]  We got to dig that out from like four years ago.
[57:43.720 --> 57:48.080]  They are there claiming Trump's this Russian agent and the intelligence community says
[57:48.080 --> 57:49.480]  we got the wiretaps.
[57:49.480 --> 57:50.480]  There's nothing there.
[57:50.480 --> 57:51.880]  There's not even phone calls.
[57:51.880 --> 57:52.880]  There's nothing at all.
[57:52.880 --> 57:54.440]  It's, you know, they dug as hard as they could.
[57:54.440 --> 57:56.000]  They tried everything they could.
[57:56.000 --> 57:57.880]  There's just nothing to find.
[57:57.880 --> 58:02.520]  He hasn't been in business this long, been this successful, and then all of a sudden
[58:02.520 --> 58:04.520]  now he's the bad guy.
[58:04.520 --> 58:06.240]  Everyone loved him eight years ago.
[58:06.240 --> 58:07.880]  Everyone liked everything he's ever done.
[58:07.880 --> 58:10.600]  Yeah, they only started hating him as soon as he ran for president.
[58:10.600 --> 58:14.480]  When he became the president and they realized like, oh, holy shit, like he has a legitimate
[58:14.480 --> 58:16.560]  chance to unite the people.
[58:16.560 --> 58:17.800]  Then did he become racist?
[58:17.800 --> 58:18.920]  Then did he become a liar?
[58:18.920 --> 58:20.160]  Then did he become a womanizer?
[58:20.160 --> 58:25.440]  All those things that he's been now only because they see the power they hold.
[58:25.440 --> 58:26.440]  Well, he's been so smart.
[58:26.440 --> 58:31.040]  He did this all pop stuff, all of it, just to get public attention and be ready for
[58:31.040 --> 58:32.040]  this.
[58:32.040 --> 58:33.040]  This is his whole life.
[58:33.040 --> 58:34.040]  That's the thing.
[58:34.040 --> 58:35.040]  That's why they're so scared now.
[58:35.040 --> 58:37.880]  Because, I mean, he got trained basically by Joseph McCarthy's top guy.
[58:37.880 --> 58:38.880]  We'll be right back.
[58:38.880 --> 58:40.240]  Oh, he's a Russian agent, though.
[58:40.240 --> 58:41.240]  We'll be right back, folks.
[58:41.240 --> 58:42.240]  Stay with us.
[58:42.240 --> 58:55.440]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can
[58:55.440 --> 58:59.720]  produce about a group you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[58:59.720 --> 59:03.160]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[59:03.160 --> 59:05.400]  it's very, very important.
[59:05.400 --> 59:12.040]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[59:12.040 --> 59:14.280]  These are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[59:14.280 --> 59:16.400]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[59:16.400 --> 59:20.720]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[59:20.720 --> 59:23.600]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[59:23.600 --> 59:25.280]  It works like an antioxidant.
[59:25.280 --> 59:28.200]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[59:28.200 --> 59:31.360]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[59:31.360 --> 59:32.400]  It's in powder form.
[59:32.400 --> 59:35.080]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[59:35.080 --> 59:36.080]  I take this.
[59:36.080 --> 59:38.000]  This is the product that I take.
[59:38.000 --> 59:39.000]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[59:39.000 --> 59:42.520]  The product we make, we fight the global, we fight the new world order.

[59:52.720 --> 1:00:11.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:11.760 --> 1:00:18.400]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[1:00:18.400 --> 1:00:23.400]  the InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:00:23.400 --> 1:00:26.360]  There's your short segment, long segment coming up.
[1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:29.160]  We've got Tim Reigns in here and also Clinton Carter.
[1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:34.040]  Both of them are quiet professionals, but they have definitely out there in the community
[1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:39.400]  seen a lot of combat as both in the military, but also as contractors for different agencies
[1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:41.440]  and grips out there.
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:43.040]  And we should talk about this in the next segment.
[1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:44.040]  So just remind me to get there.
[1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:47.560]  Some stations don't carry this five minutes, but I just want to make a statement to all
[1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:52.720]  the viewers and listeners, Trump isn't backing off from all the intimidation, the attacks,
[1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:53.720]  the demonization.
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:59.760]  They keep thinking he's going to back off, he's not, but they are getting to his people.
[1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:04.840]  So that's the problem and he can't even get his people into the different agencies and
[1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:06.800]  they're in mutiny against the president.
[1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:10.440]  I mean, literally against the law, that's admitted they're in mutiny.
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:13.160]  What do you think you should do about that?
[1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:16.920]  You know, it's hard, by no means am I a politician and I don't have all the right answers.
[1:01:16.920 --> 1:01:20.800]  I wish I did, but to me, it's time to come out with the gloves off.
[1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:23.560]  You know, we're not sparring, we're not playing around anymore.
[1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:24.560]  It's time.
[1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:25.560]  I agree.
[1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:27.400]  Because it's hard to kick out the 4,000 people on the structure.
[1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:30.160]  He needs to go out with the big dogs that openly met with the Russians that got money
[1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:31.520]  from them that are dirty.
[1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:34.160]  He just needs to take the gloves off on these people.
[1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:36.280]  Cut the head off the snake.
[1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:37.280]  Body will die.
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:40.760]  Let's not start at the bottom, let's start at the top, the people that are doing the
[1:01:40.760 --> 1:01:45.400]  wrong thing, the people that we know can't be trusted, the people that have openly.
[1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:46.400]  We need to clean house.
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:48.160]  I'm sorry, Trump just needs to clean house.
[1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:49.680]  Clean house, but start at the top.
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:50.680]  We need to do that.
[1:01:50.680 --> 1:01:54.160]  And one thing that you don't really actually see a lot of, which is why this is so important
[1:01:54.160 --> 1:02:00.240]  now, is the fact that we don't, you know, Trump has more support that they actually
[1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:01.240]  show.
[1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:05.440]  You know, there's so many more people that support him, but whenever you flip through
[1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:09.560]  social media or, you know, CNN or whatever, you see the fact that nobody supports them
[1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:10.560]  or whatever.
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:12.480]  They admittedly distort that.
[1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:15.120]  For like two months, all his Twitter comments are negative.
[1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:16.120]  Right.
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:17.120]  That's what they say.
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:20.760]  You know, and they spent two or three days on CNN complaining about the way he chicken
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:24.480]  fried steak on his own private plane with a knife and, you know, a fork.
[1:02:24.480 --> 1:02:28.800]  So that some of the stuff that they report on is just completely not helping.
[1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:33.120]  It's, you have 25 billion of the black colleges, but they talk about Conway putting her feet
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:34.120]  on the couch.
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:35.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:37.440]  And it's just, they're just nitpicking at him.
[1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:40.880]  But, you know, now, like I said, he's got so much more support that he needs to know
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:41.880]  about.
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:43.080]  Well, we all support him.
[1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:45.400]  He got elected for a reason and I don't want him to stop.
[1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:47.160]  You know, he started 100 miles an hour.
[1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:48.160]  He's going.
[1:02:48.160 --> 1:02:49.160]  He's getting things done.
[1:02:49.160 --> 1:02:52.080]  And so we just need to support him and just keep going on with it.
[1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:53.080]  You know, that's key.
[1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:54.920]  I don't want to demoralize people saying they just stand up for Trump.
[1:02:54.920 --> 1:02:57.840]  It's just that we can't just think he's there alone.
[1:02:57.840 --> 1:02:58.840]  They're coming after him.
[1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:02.240]  He's still winning, but it's like a lion surrounded by a hundred wolves.
[1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:06.400]  And we've got to get in there, folks, because, because, look, his approval rating is only
[1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:08.000]  going up even with her skewed polls.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.680]  So America gets it, but the enemy is getting more and more pissed.
[1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:13.280]  They need to get bloody noses.
[1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:14.280]  They need to back off.
[1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:17.840]  They're just something like a wimp that thinks they're invincible and always gets in your
[1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:18.840]  face.
[1:03:18.840 --> 1:03:19.840]  So you break their jaw.
[1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:21.920]  I mean, I'm not looking for violence here, but I mean, politically, he's got to break
[1:03:21.920 --> 1:03:22.920]  some necks.
[1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:26.920]  And that's the thing until, you know, they can continue to push and do what they're doing.
[1:03:26.920 --> 1:03:33.560]  It just has to be met with, you know, a strong counter movement.
[1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:34.840]  You know, we've, we voted.
[1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:35.840]  We picked what we wanted.
[1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:36.960]  They're calling for killing him everywhere.
[1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:37.960]  What have I said?
[1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:41.480]  Send in helicopters to Congress, clean them up, clean out the Democrats, arrest all their
[1:03:41.480 --> 1:03:42.480]  asses.
[1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:43.480]  I mean, that's probably what they should do.
[1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:46.240]  They're globalist enemies, but I'm not even saying doing that because it goes on a dangerous
[1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:47.240]  road.
[1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:48.640]  But the road with them running things is even more dangerous.
[1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:51.320]  So the first time in my life, I'm ready to see all their asses arrested.
[1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:53.600]  They've all committed a bunch of goddamn crimes anyways.
[1:03:53.600 --> 1:03:55.480]  And that's why, uh, that's why they're scared.
[1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:58.160]  That's why they keep attacking them because they can't control them.
[1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:00.280]  Well, they know he's going to burrow in and get them.
[1:04:00.280 --> 1:04:01.280]  Definitely.
[1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:02.280]  Most definitely.
[1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:03.280]  Yeah.
[1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:05.080]  I mean, just like with the attacks in Berkeley and stuff like that, people are trying to
[1:04:05.080 --> 1:04:10.720]  do a peaceful protest, you know, like we're just pro-Trump rally.
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:14.160]  And then people are going to come out, they're cowards, they hide their face, they hit people
[1:04:14.160 --> 1:04:18.760]  with sticks, they pepper spray someone, like it's real simple to pick on a little man or
[1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:20.120]  a woman or something like that.
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:24.760]  It's just out trying to be, you know, peaceful and have a, a, a demonstration.
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:28.720]  Well, you know, you picked on us, you did what you wanted, you asked for a fight, now
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:29.720]  you have one.
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:33.480]  So quit being cowards, uncover your face, the antifas and all this.
[1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:36.120]  Like it doesn't take a big man to hide your face.
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:38.800]  You see my face, you hear my message.
[1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:41.480]  Tell me if that's your deal.
[1:04:41.480 --> 1:04:44.360]  Let's talk about what happened in Berkeley again, these attack peaceful people everywhere
[1:04:44.360 --> 1:04:47.960]  and let's get into, again, how this will work.
[1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:51.200]  Again, it's just getting the people motivated, but particularly the veterans because people
[1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:55.320]  really listen to you as the, as a moral authority because you've stood up for something.
[1:04:55.320 --> 1:04:56.320]  You're not a coward.
[1:04:56.320 --> 1:05:00.000]  We need you to lead for the Republic right now and Trump needs your help as well.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:04.680]  I'm beginning to think Mexico's border policy and immigration policy is whatever goes against
[1:05:04.680 --> 1:05:05.680]  Trump.
[1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:10.280]  In the Senate move, the Mexican government is now paying $50 million to give legal support
[1:05:10.280 --> 1:05:13.080]  to Mexican nationals living in the US illegally.
[1:05:13.080 --> 1:05:17.040]  So Mexico won't pay for a wall, but they will pay for people who leave Mexico for the United
[1:05:17.040 --> 1:05:19.080]  States, I guess because it's better.
[1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:21.980]  If you do so legally though, they have no funding for you.
[1:05:21.980 --> 1:05:26.240]  All 50 Mexican consulates to the US are launching legal assistance centers for Mexican nationals
[1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:29.160]  living in the US illegally who are fearing deportation.
[1:05:29.160 --> 1:05:33.280]  In contrast, however, I cannot go to Mexico and have the US government pay any legal
[1:05:33.280 --> 1:05:35.840]  fees I may incur for migrating illegally.
[1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:38.920]  And why would Mexico pay people who left their country?
[1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:40.080]  Is Mexico that bad?
[1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:44.160]  They just refuse to go back or are the people that left Mexico that bad?
[1:05:44.160 --> 1:05:45.840]  They're paying to keep them out.
[1:05:45.840 --> 1:05:51.280]  No, I think any anti-Trump politicians from anywhere on earth have now abandoned all logic,
[1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:56.280]  all common sense, all true policy and diplomacy and attempt to go against anything President
[1:05:56.280 --> 1:05:57.280]  Trump tries to do.
[1:05:57.280 --> 1:06:00.560]  For info wars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[1:06:00.560 --> 1:06:01.920]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:06.280]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off the grid
[1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:10.400]  products of 2017 and seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:14.040]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from
[1:06:14.040 --> 1:06:16.280]  Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[1:06:16.280 --> 1:06:20.480]  The PPX is so small, you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful, you can run some
[1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:25.280]  110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling.
[1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:29.720]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18 wheelers, heavy equipment,
[1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:30.960]  even airplanes.
[1:06:30.960 --> 1:06:34.640]  The system provides an endless supply of off the grid electricity, allowing you to create
[1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:38.040]  your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[1:06:38.040 --> 1:06:42.840]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[1:06:42.840 --> 1:06:46.200]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[1:06:46.200 --> 1:06:48.320]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[1:06:48.320 --> 1:06:54.040]  Even better, use coupon code private at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[1:06:54.040 --> 1:06:56.440]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[1:06:56.440 --> 1:06:59.840]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:04.400]  We're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWare when you visit infowarslife.com
[1:07:04.400 --> 1:07:08.840]  and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine and all the great products
[1:07:08.840 --> 1:07:09.840]  at infowarslife.com.
[1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:14.520]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists,
[1:07:14.520 --> 1:07:16.600]  and the answer is clear.
[1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:21.240]  Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information coming out that we
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:23.440]  simply can't even keep up with it.
[1:07:23.440 --> 1:07:28.840]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these
[1:07:28.840 --> 1:07:32.360]  purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:36.280]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[1:07:36.280 --> 1:07:39.200]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:43.400]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield nascent iodine,
[1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:47.760]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[1:07:47.760 --> 1:07:52.040]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[1:07:52.040 --> 1:08:14.520]  It is exclusive to infowarslife.com and the infowarslife family of incredible products.
[1:08:14.520 --> 1:08:22.400]  On the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:08:22.400 --> 1:08:26.760]  You know, it was Clinton who just pointed out that today is the Battle of the Alamo Day.
[1:08:26.760 --> 1:08:29.960]  This is the day the Alamo fell.
[1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:39.960]  March 6, 1836, just incredible, and Patterson was the land commissioner then, and he was
[1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:40.960]  running for governor.
[1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:41.960]  I wish he would have won him.
[1:08:41.960 --> 1:08:46.560]  He was running for governor as well, but it had been a feedlot until the 50s.
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:48.720]  The Daughters of the Republic of Texas took it over.
[1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:50.200]  They wouldn't allow any political speeches there.
[1:08:50.200 --> 1:08:53.880]  Well, the state took it back over, and the only speech that's been given there was that
[1:08:53.880 --> 1:08:54.880]  one three years ago.
[1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:56.800]  You can Google Alex Jones' Alamo speech.
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:00.120]  It's pretty powerful, but there was a lot of other powerful speeches that day.
[1:09:00.120 --> 1:09:05.280]  It was just crazy that not just to speak at the Alamo, and my ancestors were involved
[1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:09.640]  in all that, but to then, you know, that's somebody else's live feed.
[1:09:09.640 --> 1:09:15.360]  There's an HD feed we've got, but the point is, is that it's just epic how reaching back
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:20.360]  in time, we're all connected, there it is, to those very same things.
[1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:26.480]  Tim Reems, of course, Quentin Carter, both veterans of all over the world, looking what
[1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:32.160]  we see today, where this country is, the beachhead we've got, Trump's approval rating is up.
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:34.960]  He's getting a lot of positive things done.
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:37.880]  It's just the unmitigated attack we have to understand.
[1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:44.440]  He's got the Republican leadership, the Democratic leadership, all bought by the Soros interests.
[1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:50.200]  Paul Ryan, you name it, on Soros payroll, you've got the MSM, you've got foreign governments,
[1:09:50.200 --> 1:09:54.000]  they're all piled on against him claiming he won because of the Russians.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.200]  Not because of his message, it's so insulting to the American people, but I'm not here in
[1:09:58.200 --> 1:10:03.000]  an SOS, I'm just telling you, they are intending to go all out, and it's going to take more
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.960]  than Trump to beat him, and he can't sit up there as the commander in chief and look weak.
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:07.960]  He's not.
[1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:08.960]  He's strong.
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:09.960]  He's not backing down.
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:10.960]  He's counting on us.
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:14.200]  That's why he says, we're going to have more rallies, and I need the veterans, and I'm doing
[1:10:14.200 --> 1:10:15.200]  this for you.
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:21.640]  We're together because he's telling everybody, he's really trying, and it's almost surreal
[1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:25.480]  after all these traders or people that are milk toast, people that are halfway good and
[1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:30.920]  bad, to actually have somebody on fire and to see small businesses explode and the stock
[1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:35.240]  market exploding, confidence exploding, respect for the country exploding, and all the good
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:38.800]  things he's doing, and to see this pack of scum out to get him, Pelosi, when he talked
[1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:44.040]  about jobs or veterans, wouldn't even stand up or clap, these are arrogant pieces of trash.
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:46.000]  You guys, don't be respectful here.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:50.320]  Takeover, let's talk more about that, but also, we don't say any names yet, but a lot
[1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:53.960]  of really prominent folks that are patriots, they're going to be joining us the next days
[1:10:53.960 --> 1:10:57.120]  and weeks, also pushing for veterans just to stand up and speak out.
[1:10:57.120 --> 1:11:01.120]  It doesn't mean veterans are going to save the world by themselves, but by going to city
[1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:05.320]  council, calling C-SPAN, coming on the show, putting stuff out with a photo of yourself
[1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:06.320]  saying, I'm Trump.
[1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:09.680]  You know, Quentin explained to people about, I was talking about the I'm Sparta, she said,
[1:11:09.680 --> 1:11:13.120]  no, no, no, we've already done that military before, explain what it means to say I'm Donald
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:14.120]  Trump.
[1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:19.360]  Yeah, basically what we're trying to say is that, we support him, we are him, he is
[1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:26.960]  us, he takes care of us, he supports us, we 100% wholeheartedly agree with what's going
[1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:35.280]  on, we honestly believe as a whole that our best interests are in his, in his or in ours.
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:39.160]  So I just want to see all of the veterans go out, like a lot of the pictures we're
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:42.760]  showing right now, they weren't allowed to show their faces because they were standing
[1:11:42.760 --> 1:11:46.320]  up against the current president or commander in chief.
[1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:51.000]  Well, that's no longer an issue, so we want you to be proud, stand up, show your face,
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:54.800]  say who you are, you know, show the world a solidarity.
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:58.200]  Sure, and let's be clear, we took famous ones from three and a half years ago that
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:01.600]  turned the tide against backing al-Qaeda in Syria, and so I wanted to put them side by
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:04.480]  side, but I don't have time until the career where we show the original, what they said
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:07.920]  I won't be al-Qaeda's air force, and then now we've changed it as an example of what
[1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:11.240]  we think is a good idea, but I'm sure you'll come up with better ideas.
[1:12:11.240 --> 1:12:16.320]  That's correct, and we'll do it, we'll figure it out, and the viewers will do a great job,
[1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:18.720]  you know, they're far more creative than I'll ever be.
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:22.600]  There'll be somebody out there that makes that sign that goes viral, and when it does,
[1:12:22.600 --> 1:12:26.280]  it'll come to ample wars, we'll repost it, we'll retweet it, we'll do all that stuff,
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:27.440]  we'll make it big.
[1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:30.760]  And the Democrats call themselves the resistance now, and that's our classic term, we didn't
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:34.440]  just invent that, everybody that's a resistance against the system, the whole system's against
[1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:38.400]  Trump, we are the resistance, trying to restore our republic.
[1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:42.320]  No, we definitely are, you know, and if there was just one thing I could say to President
[1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:47.520]  Trump, you know, face to face, is just don't stop, okay, just don't stop, keep going, and
[1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:52.040]  we're here to support you, now, he can't be everywhere, he can't make, you know, there's
[1:12:52.040 --> 1:12:56.280]  320 million Americans, he can't make everybody happy, but he is the Commander-in-Chief, it's
[1:12:56.280 --> 1:13:01.040]  our turn now to support him, you know, for President Trump, don't stop, we back you 100%,
[1:13:01.040 --> 1:13:05.520]  now that you are the President, it's our turn to now support you, and show our support,
[1:13:05.520 --> 1:13:08.520]  you know, just like you said on social media, with the-
[1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:09.920]  Well, he can't help it, he can't stop.
[1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:13.840]  No, he can't stop, and I don't think he wants to, which is the reason why we voted him into
[1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:14.840]  office and-
[1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:16.720]  And the fight didn't end when we elected him.
[1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:20.520]  Well, they're playing chicken with somebody who is going to go to the end.
[1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:21.520]  Right, and that's the thing like-
[1:13:21.520 --> 1:13:24.240]  But whether he's destroyed or victorious is up to us.
[1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:27.640]  That's exactly right, you know, it's just the election was not enough, the election was
[1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:34.800]  just basically the first step, now it's time to stand behind and move forward, you know,
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:37.440]  if you can lead, lead, if you can't follow, but do something.
[1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:41.920]  Well, I've said it, everybody's always saying they want this or that, or they want to see
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:47.600]  globalism on its knees, the TPP, all these unelected systems, all these globalist systems,
[1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:51.800]  all these horrible, arrogant systems are all already in flames, he's already devastated
[1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:52.800]  them.
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:55.960]  Think of the victories of exposing the fake polls and seeing it and giving Hillary the
[1:13:55.960 --> 1:13:57.720]  questions and her directing the media.
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:02.120]  Think of all our glorious victories, they can change it all, but he's a Russian agent.
[1:14:02.120 --> 1:14:05.240]  That's why it's important to say, am I a Russian agent?
[1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:06.240]  Because I support America?
[1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:11.200]  This is a load of crap, these people, and like I said, Hillary's the one getting 35 million
[1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:12.200]  from Putin.
[1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:17.280]  They're the ones that, I mean, I had, this is what happened, I had Kurt Weldon, former
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:21.920]  head of the intelligence committee for the Republicans on two weeks ago, he said, I'm
[1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:25.120]  pissed, I know what's going on, I know they're saying he's a Russian agent, all this crap.
[1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:28.960]  I saw the documents that were secret that Hillary was actually commanded by the Chinese.
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:32.040]  He said, I'm coming out the next week, I know they probably, he said, they threatened
[1:14:32.040 --> 1:14:33.040]  my family and I'm doing it.
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:37.000]  He still hadn't come on yet, he got pissed, he came on, but then it's like these people
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.640]  go, I'm going to do the right thing, and then, well, they're a lot secret, you can't talk
[1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:40.640]  about it.
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:45.400]  I mean, Hillary literally, I've been told this by former CIA section chiefs from Asia.
[1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:48.240]  Hillary since the 80s has been on the Chinese payroll.
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:51.920]  It's not some double agent deal, folks, she's totally paid for.
[1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:56.360]  Yeah, I'm not, I'm not exactly sure what their, you know, I understand exactly what
[1:14:56.360 --> 1:15:01.200]  they're saying as far as, you know, Trump being a Russian spy this, this, it's just,
[1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:05.000]  you know, we just need to, you know, back them and help them do what he said he was
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  going to do.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  And he started, you know.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.640]  Yeah, the Russians want our taxes cut, the bigger military.
[1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:10.640]  Yeah.
[1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:11.640]  Right.
[1:15:11.640 --> 1:15:12.640]  I mean, I don't think so.
[1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:19.520]  So they want their largest opposition in the world to be more fruitful and more successful.
[1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:21.840]  I think that absolutely makes no sense whatsoever.
[1:15:21.840 --> 1:15:22.840]  No.
[1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:26.480]  And they have the intelligence community said, no, no evidence.
[1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:28.920]  It was all made up, fake wiretap crap.
[1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:31.040]  Then they go, oh, we didn't do our taps.
[1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:32.040]  Right.
[1:15:32.040 --> 1:15:35.880]  I want the guy who trains to fight against me in battle to have the same weapons that
[1:15:35.880 --> 1:15:39.840]  I have to eat the same amount of food that I have to sleep in the same comfy bed that
[1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:40.840]  I have.
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:42.400]  No, absolutely not.
[1:15:42.400 --> 1:15:46.600]  I want that due to sleep and rocks and have some busted set of gear and a weapon that
[1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:47.600]  doesn't work.
[1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:48.600]  Why?
[1:15:48.600 --> 1:15:51.080]  Because I want every single advantage I have to beat him.
[1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:55.960]  So to think that for any means or for any reason that the Russians would want us to
[1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:58.200]  do better by having him elected is just stupid.
[1:15:58.200 --> 1:15:59.200]  It is.
[1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:00.200]  It definitely is.
[1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:01.200]  And you're completely right.
[1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:04.200]  It's, it's almost comical in my opinion.
[1:16:04.200 --> 1:16:08.120]  It's almost comical to actually think that, you know, they would want us to succeed in
[1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:12.600]  any way by, you know, helping him get away, making America great again.
[1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:13.600]  Right.
[1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:14.600]  Yeah.
[1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:15.600]  Why, why, why would they, why would they want that?
[1:16:15.600 --> 1:16:16.600]  Why would they care?
[1:16:16.600 --> 1:16:17.600]  You know, teach his own, whatever they do.
[1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:18.600]  Hey, as long as it doesn't endanger the safety of others.
[1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:19.600]  I don't care.
[1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:22.480]  I'm, I'm here and President Trump is here for the Americans.
[1:16:22.480 --> 1:16:23.480]  That's it.
[1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:24.680]  I mean, it's so clear cut.
[1:16:24.680 --> 1:16:27.040]  So I've been asked a lot of questions, making a lot of points.
[1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:28.680]  Let's talk about some of the other great patriots.
[1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:31.840]  I mean, you guys, we should have made phone calls about seven o'clock last night.
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:34.920]  Well, I mean, you told me this morning, the response was just boom.
[1:16:34.920 --> 1:16:35.920]  You too.
[1:16:35.920 --> 1:16:36.920]  Yeah.
[1:16:36.920 --> 1:16:39.760]  We were responding when I, when we talked about, I mean, it's, this is what we do work.
[1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:41.240]  We work all the time.
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:44.600]  Anyone that knows you and I knows that there's no such thing as downtime.
[1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:46.840]  There's no such thing as off time.
[1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:51.400]  We talk sometimes in the middle of the night, morning, whatever, but we ever break these
[1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:52.400]  people's back.
[1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:53.400]  We're going to take some vacations.
[1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:54.400]  We could do it too.
[1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:55.400]  Yeah.
[1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:56.400]  We're going to.
[1:16:56.400 --> 1:16:57.400]  It's just a matter of, of keep pushing.
[1:16:57.400 --> 1:17:00.760]  We have the platform to get the message out.
[1:17:00.760 --> 1:17:03.280]  So that's the idea is use our platform.
[1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:06.880]  A lot of people have the same idea or ideology that we have and they want to say this.
[1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:07.880]  The same things.
[1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:11.320]  They just don't know how to get it out in a, in a media form.
[1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:12.400]  They need the trade enough.
[1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:13.400]  They need them.
[1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:14.400]  They need us.
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:15.400]  Yeah.
[1:17:15.400 --> 1:17:16.400]  Or they might be afraid to come out on their own.
[1:17:16.400 --> 1:17:17.400]  Understand it.
[1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:18.400]  We're not afraid.
[1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:19.400]  We, we don't, we don't run.
[1:17:19.400 --> 1:17:23.920]  I'm afraid of failing and letting these anti-American, anti-human scumbags who think they're better
[1:17:23.920 --> 1:17:28.080]  than us and want to just dominate us because they know I'm not being elitist.
[1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:30.200]  You look at our opposition, they're scum.
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:33.960]  They're willing to do nasty bad stuff for control and we just want them off our backs.
[1:17:33.960 --> 1:17:38.520]  I mean, for me, it's totally, it totally overwhelms me in a good way.
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:41.280]  Like I'm possessed by the desire to beat these people.
[1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:42.960]  It's not about money, fame, any of it.
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:47.680]  I'm tired of scum trying to screw people over because they don't want any competition.
[1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:48.680]  Yeah.
[1:17:48.680 --> 1:17:51.720]  And it's just like you said, you know, you started this yesterday on around seven o'clock
[1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:56.280]  and means you had talked and every since then the, hasn't even been 24 hours yet.
[1:17:56.280 --> 1:18:00.600]  We have a list of veterans, known veterans who have been put in a spotlight who have
[1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:02.840]  done really well for themselves and they're going to come on here and they're going to
[1:18:02.840 --> 1:18:06.520]  talk and, but that list just keeps growing because more and more want to, you know, do
[1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:09.440]  it like you said, support Trump and come out here and actually have.
[1:18:09.440 --> 1:18:10.440]  And I don't care where they do it.
[1:18:10.440 --> 1:18:13.040]  I've said here, wherever they're all going to do it here.
[1:18:13.040 --> 1:18:16.280]  I just want to see them stand up because the country needs them.
[1:18:16.280 --> 1:18:18.840]  And I talked to a lot of them on the phone whenever I called them, you know, I actually
[1:18:18.840 --> 1:18:22.760]  called a lot of the guys up and said, hey, you know, Alex Jones is talking about doing
[1:18:22.760 --> 1:18:23.760]  this.
[1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:24.760]  Where do you stand?
[1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:25.760]  And I, hey, can I fly down tomorrow?
[1:18:25.760 --> 1:18:26.760]  They actually want to be here.
[1:18:26.760 --> 1:18:29.040]  It's not, you know, twisting their arm, anything like that.
[1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:31.600]  They want to be here because they truly believe in everything that you're saying.
[1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:34.880]  They truly believe in everything that Trump is doing because he is looking out for the
[1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:36.840]  better, you know, better for the veterans.
[1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:37.840]  He's looking out for us.
[1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:42.360]  And he's, even though a lot of Americans won't think he is, he's actually looking out for
[1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:43.360]  all of America.
[1:18:43.360 --> 1:18:44.360]  Well, that's the thing.
[1:18:44.360 --> 1:18:47.120]  They listen to the news that just won't report anything he's doing, but I sit there every
[1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:48.520]  day watching when he actually did.
[1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:52.280]  It's everything you do to empower the people.
[1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:55.760]  We should release like a top 10 list, just something, a quick little article, whatever
[1:18:55.760 --> 1:18:58.760]  on top 10 things that he's done that they're not telling.
[1:18:58.760 --> 1:19:00.240]  You know, that's a great headline.
[1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:02.920]  Top 10 things Trump's done for the, for the, for the people.
[1:19:02.920 --> 1:19:03.920]  Right.
[1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:05.400]  You know, 25 billion for black colleges.
[1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:06.920]  You don't see that anywhere.
[1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:09.400]  You know, cutting two thirds of the regulations on small business.
[1:19:09.400 --> 1:19:10.400]  Right.
[1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:15.000]  Best job, small business numbers since 1984, three trillion out of the stock market.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  Yeah.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:19.920]  Signed and executive orders, you don't have to pay $5,000 if you don't get Obama here.
[1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:20.920]  Killed the mandate.
[1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:22.440]  The news won't even tell you that.
[1:19:22.440 --> 1:19:23.440]  So that's what we should do.
[1:19:23.440 --> 1:19:24.440]  We should show them.
[1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:28.440]  So instead of, we, we cover stories, we do things here quite differently than everyone
[1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:29.440]  else.
[1:19:29.440 --> 1:19:33.920]  But, you know, there are things that are, are missed because we literally can't cover
[1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:34.920]  everything.
[1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:36.600]  He does so much, so good that we can't do it all.
[1:19:36.600 --> 1:19:37.600]  In a short time.
[1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:38.600]  Yeah.
[1:19:38.600 --> 1:19:39.600]  I mean, it's done.
[1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:41.080]  He took the veterans off the number one terror list.
[1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:42.400]  He said, they're not on the list.
[1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:43.400]  Right.
[1:19:43.400 --> 1:19:44.400]  Yeah.
[1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:45.400]  And we should do something we should.
[1:19:45.400 --> 1:19:48.480]  Like I said, when veterans start blowing stuff up, then we'll put them on list.
[1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:50.440]  We should post a list.
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:55.600]  You know, like our headlines, our top 10 list, top five, whatever it is of the things that
[1:19:55.600 --> 1:20:00.880]  he's done, that no one else is covering so that we can show that truth to everyone.
[1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:01.880]  Sure.
[1:20:01.880 --> 1:20:04.920]  Well, everybody like Jesse James, you name it, who, again, Jesse James isn't Brad.
[1:20:04.920 --> 1:20:06.440]  Everybody really says how big he is.
[1:20:06.440 --> 1:20:08.920]  He sold $2 billion for the product in Walmart.
[1:20:08.920 --> 1:20:11.280]  He has control the entire NRA brand.
[1:20:11.280 --> 1:20:12.520]  He has the next five years.
[1:20:12.520 --> 1:20:13.520]  You know, we're friends.
[1:20:13.520 --> 1:20:14.520]  We got to dinner and stuff.
[1:20:14.520 --> 1:20:15.520]  I'll never get into all that.
[1:20:15.520 --> 1:20:18.000]  I don't ever ask him for anything in the six years I've known him.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:21.080]  And when I call him to say, I need you to come out for Trump and mobilize everybody you've
[1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:24.640]  got for him, we need to get visible now because they're, they're that Soros.
[1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:27.240]  All those people are putting people in town halls or taking action.
[1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:31.000]  I mean, it isn't just supporting Trump, it's supporting our damn selves.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.200]  We asked for somebody to be a champion and stick their neck out.
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:34.200]  This is it.
[1:20:34.200 --> 1:20:35.200]  We better get involved.
[1:20:35.200 --> 1:20:36.200]  He said, absolutely.
[1:20:36.200 --> 1:20:37.200]  I'm coming in Friday.
[1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:39.920]  I'm going to mobilize my whole list of millions of people and it's just, you know, it's just
[1:20:39.920 --> 1:20:42.280]  everybody understands we got to do this.
[1:20:42.280 --> 1:20:43.280]  Yes.
[1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:46.160]  I don't care where you do it, folks, because they'll, anybody associated with me, they'll
[1:20:46.160 --> 1:20:47.160]  lie about it.
[1:20:47.160 --> 1:20:48.160]  If you eat, I don't care.
[1:20:48.160 --> 1:20:49.160]  The point is you support Trump.
[1:20:49.160 --> 1:20:50.160]  They'll do it.
[1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:51.160]  It doesn't matter.
[1:20:51.160 --> 1:20:53.920]  We know Michael Moore and people like this are scum.
[1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:54.920]  Okay.
[1:20:54.920 --> 1:20:55.920]  He has six armed bodyguards.
[1:20:55.920 --> 1:20:57.520]  He doesn't want you to be able to have a gun.
[1:20:57.520 --> 1:20:59.020]  They're scum.
[1:20:59.020 --> 1:21:03.800]  They are scum and they look at veterans and people and they don't feel confident by seeing
[1:21:03.800 --> 1:21:05.880]  manly men or people that are strong and have convictions.
[1:21:05.880 --> 1:21:08.120]  They get pissed because they're criminals.
[1:21:08.120 --> 1:21:11.000]  Of course, a criminal mindset hates its veterans.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:16.840]  You know, it's, it's definitely, you're definitely correct and which is kind of absurd, really.
[1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:20.760]  You know, veterans, they just, just like President Trump, just like yourself, they want everybody
[1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:24.760]  in America to succeed and prosper, but they really don't care about everybody else.
[1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:30.200]  You know, but if the president or whoever is allowed to have bodyguards with fully automatic
[1:21:30.200 --> 1:21:34.720]  guns or whatever, or, you know, then we should, by me, by all means, at least be able to carry
[1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:38.080]  just a semi-automatic pistol to protect ourselves.
[1:21:38.080 --> 1:21:42.280]  And all the numbers show that can still carry people or the normally veterans, the lowest
[1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:43.280]  level of crime.
[1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:44.280]  Right.
[1:21:44.280 --> 1:21:45.280]  Like we're good people.
[1:21:45.280 --> 1:21:46.280]  Leave us the hell alone.
[1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:49.600]  You have the inherent right to self-defense, regardless of anything.
[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:50.760]  It's not a God-given right.
[1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:51.960]  It's a birth-given right.
[1:21:51.960 --> 1:21:52.960]  You're a human being.
[1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:54.040]  You live on this earth.
[1:21:54.040 --> 1:21:55.480]  You have the right to self-defense.
[1:21:55.480 --> 1:22:01.680]  You have the right to not be taken advantage of, to not be robbed, to not be killed.
[1:22:01.680 --> 1:22:06.920]  You have not only the right, but the responsibility to, you know, protect those people around
[1:22:06.920 --> 1:22:07.920]  you.
[1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:10.320]  I think that certain people are given certain roles in life.
[1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:12.920]  Tim and I can both agree that we are protectors.
[1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:13.920]  It's who we are.
[1:22:13.920 --> 1:22:14.920]  It's what we've done.
[1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:21.480]  You know, among the two of us, we probably have, you know, 50 years combined service
[1:22:21.480 --> 1:22:25.040]  protecting it and taking care of other people.
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:29.600]  And it's because other people can't, you know, so it's, you're right.
[1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:32.760]  It's your responsibility to protect those around you that can't.
[1:22:32.760 --> 1:22:35.720]  I don't have a problem using a firearm.
[1:22:35.720 --> 1:22:36.880]  I train with a firearm.
[1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:39.120]  I carry a firearm all the time.
[1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:42.600]  Maybe the person next to me doesn't, but I want to be ready and prepared.
[1:22:42.600 --> 1:22:47.040]  You don't take the fact that they're weak and stupid as a plush, you as a human take
[1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:48.040]  it as bad.
[1:22:48.040 --> 1:22:49.040]  You want to build them up.
[1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:50.040]  That's exactly.
[1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:55.160]  And it's this animal hateful garbage by these weak people that they see dumbed down people
[1:22:55.160 --> 1:23:00.640]  and they see them as prey and they show all this evil and just for me, metaphysically,
[1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:02.560]  I feel the impression they're willing us.
[1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:03.560]  I see it.
[1:23:03.560 --> 1:23:06.120]  They think they're going to win with all their arrogance and no, they're not.
[1:23:06.120 --> 1:23:09.280]  I mean, I'll just tell you right now, they're planning a physical war.
[1:23:09.280 --> 1:23:12.480]  If Hillary got in, they said they were going to shut me down and then as she said it,
[1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:15.280]  they were going to take, go out with the veterans.
[1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:22.040]  We got articles on m4wars.com today where Obama got caught stealing almost $200 billion out
[1:23:22.040 --> 1:23:26.280]  of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of investors money to implode it because he didn't like
[1:23:26.280 --> 1:23:27.560]  middle-class people getting houses.
[1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:32.360]  I mean, they want to blow the engine of prosperity up, man, just like communists.
[1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:37.480]  These are assholes and I'm sorry to use that term, but they are, they're out to get you.
[1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:39.560]  And I know you're not a serial killer.
[1:23:39.560 --> 1:23:42.440]  You're not smiling once you grab kids out of the back of the yard or young women in torture
[1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:43.440]  and to death.
[1:23:43.440 --> 1:23:44.440]  So you don't understand that.
[1:23:44.440 --> 1:23:46.880]  Well, understand that's who they are.
[1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:48.600]  Obama is a dirt bag.
[1:23:48.600 --> 1:23:49.600]  Okay.
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:50.600]  He was never our president.
[1:23:50.600 --> 1:23:56.120]  He's a, and I'm just telling you, if you simply stand up a little bit, it's game over.
[1:23:56.120 --> 1:24:01.040]  We're already kicking their ass, but we're seeing their full push now because they were
[1:24:01.040 --> 1:24:03.040]  the attackers before.
[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:04.440]  And so we had the initiative to defeat them.
[1:24:04.440 --> 1:24:07.080]  Now they see it as their corner, which they're not.
[1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:08.840]  So they're giving us their full attack.
[1:24:08.840 --> 1:24:15.120]  We have to realize the war only started now and I'm telling you, you do, your children,
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:18.720]  everybody absolutely deserve for you to do the right thing.
[1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:19.960]  And it's not work folks.
[1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:24.720]  The animating contest of liberty that Jefferson talked about is everything.
[1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:28.120]  You know, I mean, I mean, let me tell you, I was in high school or college, girls, whatever,
[1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:29.560]  none of it made me happy.
[1:24:29.560 --> 1:24:31.080]  Fighting for freedom is what it's all about.
[1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:32.120]  It's so fulfilling.
[1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:34.000]  You can't even deal with it.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.600]  And then I look at these people that have nothing but bad will for everybody.
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:38.680]  And I tell you, I don't hate them.
[1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:39.680]  I want to see them broken.
[1:24:39.680 --> 1:24:41.600]  Guys, we've got about six, seven minutes left.
[1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:44.800]  I want to commend you for taking action and the big stuff you're developing and setting
[1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:45.800]  up.
[1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:47.720]  So thank you for doing that, Tim.
[1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:52.320]  And of course, Quentin, just, just spend a few minutes, because you're humble guys,
[1:24:52.320 --> 1:24:55.960]  but just get into, you know, really what you think in a closing statement to everybody
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:24:57.480]  a call to action for the Republic.
[1:24:57.480 --> 1:25:01.080]  Well, you know, starting, you know, just like you said, the one, the first thing you'd
[1:25:01.080 --> 1:25:04.520]  remember being excited about was fighting for your freedom and stuff like that.
[1:25:04.520 --> 1:25:07.320]  So that's, that's why I joined the Marine Corps at such a young age at 18.
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:11.480]  I joined the Marine Corps and I truly believed in our mission and helping people around the
[1:25:11.480 --> 1:25:17.480]  world is that, but, you know, around, you know, 2010, 2011, 12, I started to develop
[1:25:17.480 --> 1:25:22.680]  this sense of not really actually doing what I set out to do as far as the administration
[1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:30.160]  at that time, you know, kind of using us as a way to get, you know, better filler pockets.
[1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:34.200]  But you know, now that Trump's elected, you know, I'm really looking forward to what he's
[1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:35.200]  got for the next four years.
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:38.400]  And now I'm starting to feel better about what I had done.
[1:25:38.400 --> 1:25:41.960]  And you know, he's, he's really looking out for the veterans and, and I'm just loving
[1:25:41.960 --> 1:25:42.960]  it right now.
[1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:47.400]  And so I'm going to come on here and support any way that I can go on social media, support
[1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:51.000]  with a I am Trump shirt, whatever you guys, whatever you guys like.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Absolutely.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:55.320]  And the thing I want to say is remember their strength in numbers, you know, that's, that's
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:25:58.120]  what gets things done.
[1:25:58.120 --> 1:26:00.920]  You know, a million ants carry a lot of leaves.
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:04.720]  It's something super simple, you know, the many hands make light work.
[1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:05.720]  That's it.
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:10.680]  You know, so stand up, be counted, pull your weight, do the right thing.
[1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:11.960]  This is your call to action.
[1:26:11.960 --> 1:26:12.960]  You did a little bit.
[1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:13.960]  We all voted.
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:14.960]  The fight is not over.
[1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:15.960]  It's legendary.
[1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:16.960]  Keep going.
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:17.960]  It's true though.
[1:26:17.960 --> 1:26:19.720]  Legendary history is passing before your eyes.
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:20.720]  Be part of it.
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:22.720]  The energy level is just explosive.
[1:26:22.720 --> 1:26:27.240]  I mean, this is a, I mean, I can't stop working 18 hours a day because this is history.
[1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:29.240]  This is the fight between good and evil.
[1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:30.240]  This is it.
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:34.680]  There will never be a time in our lives where our children's lives more important is
[1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:35.920]  right now.
[1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:44.920]  This makes or breaks the, the everything about America is the 10 generations sale all has
[1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:45.920]  right now.
[1:26:45.920 --> 1:26:47.440]  This is what fixes everything.
[1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:48.440]  Yeah.
[1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:49.440]  This decides the motion.
[1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:53.000]  And I would like to say, you know, one last thing for all the veterans out there, you
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:57.160]  know, don't be afraid, you know, stand up, don't be afraid to say, yes, I voted for
[1:26:57.160 --> 1:26:59.280]  Trump or yes, I support him.
[1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:00.280]  Don't be afraid.
[1:27:00.280 --> 1:27:01.280]  That's right.
[1:27:01.280 --> 1:27:02.280]  Get past the bullying.
[1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:03.280]  Exactly.
[1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:07.320]  So don't let them dominate your will and roll over to these people.
[1:27:07.320 --> 1:27:09.520]  Don't be afraid, you know, you voted.
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:10.520]  He's in office now.
[1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:12.000]  He's going to be there for you guys.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  And so now it's time for us to show that we're here for him, you know, and it'll make his
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  job easier.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:21.120]  If he sees the people that are actually behind him, even though, you know, companies like
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:23.240]  CNN, they wouldn't want you to see all this stuff.
[1:27:23.240 --> 1:27:28.000]  But, you know, if we go on the air and we talk about this and that and we show our t-shirt
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:32.320]  or a sign over our faces that I am Trump, I'm voting, you know, whatever the case may
[1:27:32.320 --> 1:27:37.080]  be, he will see that support and it will only fuel his fire and he needs it working.
[1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:38.080]  He will.
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:41.200]  I mean, he's going, but it's just that he needs help.
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:44.400]  He needs something else to the veteran community while I've got a second to say this.
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:46.280]  Remember, yeah, some of us have issues.
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:47.600]  Some of us have had a hard time.
[1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:49.560]  Some of us have dealt with the war differently.
[1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:51.800]  But understand this, you are not broken.
[1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:52.800]  You are not worthless.
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:55.520]  And don't let them tell you that that's a lie.
[1:27:55.520 --> 1:28:01.360]  It's the whole idea of trying to drug us out and keep us hooked on pills and the VA's
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:03.920]  will deny your claim until you die.
[1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:06.640]  I just want to use you like a machine and throw you away.
[1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:07.640]  No.
[1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:08.640]  The same valuable.
[1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:10.140]  You're going to show them now what you can do.
[1:28:10.140 --> 1:28:11.140]  That's it.
[1:28:11.140 --> 1:28:14.560]  The same valuable person you were when you signed, when you took that oath is the same
[1:28:14.560 --> 1:28:16.480]  person you need to be today.
[1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:20.880]  You know, you stood up, you put your life on the line, you signed a blank check that
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:24.240]  you would do anything that needed to be done for the betterment of the country.
[1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:27.680]  And now you've got a chance to really fight for the Republic, because everybody joined
[1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:28.680]  for great reasons.
[1:28:28.680 --> 1:28:29.680]  We love you.
[1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:31.760]  It's perfect, but now this is so pure.
[1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:33.920]  I want to say this is so damn pure.
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:35.760]  I mean, there's like no debating.
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:38.720]  It's like, wow, how could you not do your maximum effort?
[1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:39.720]  Go ahead.
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:41.400]  It's a hundred percent about us right now.
[1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:42.400]  Some of us joined.
[1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:43.400]  I joined.
[1:28:43.400 --> 1:28:44.400]  This is for the homeland.
[1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:45.400]  September 11th.
[1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:46.400]  Yeah, no, definitely.
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:51.160]  You know, but for me, it's now we finally have somebody in the last eight years that
[1:28:51.160 --> 1:28:54.000]  gives a damn and we've ordered them into office.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:58.040]  So that's why I'm just a static and, you know, for all the veterans out there, you know,
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:00.840]  you know, longer now, thanks to Trump, have to worry about that list, getting put on some
[1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:05.720]  sort of terrorist list, you know, go to the VA, get the help that you need and just, you
[1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:06.720]  know, keep pushing on.
[1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:08.880]  So they were threatening veterans and not be involved.
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:09.880]  Q, red point.
[1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:11.280]  Yeah, they absolutely threatened us today.
[1:29:11.280 --> 1:29:14.640]  Ask a bunch of questions, you know, when you go in for basic medical stuff.
[1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:15.880]  Oh, you have a cold.
[1:29:15.880 --> 1:29:16.880]  You need some medicine.
[1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:17.880]  Okay.
[1:29:17.880 --> 1:29:18.880]  Where are your guns in the house?
[1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:19.880]  Do you have guns?
[1:29:19.880 --> 1:29:20.880]  Do you have this and that?
[1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:24.760]  None of that is any of their business, you know, push forward and don't be a stand up,
[1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:25.760]  be counted.
[1:29:25.760 --> 1:29:26.760]  Don't be afraid of anything.
[1:29:26.760 --> 1:29:30.600]  Timothy Reims, I know you've got a lot of stuff coming with the future coming with these great
[1:29:30.600 --> 1:29:31.600]  patriots come back in with us.
[1:29:31.600 --> 1:29:32.600]  You and Q.
[1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:33.600]  Yes, sir.
[1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:36.200]  And it helped lead this initiative with Q just to all these great veterans to give them
[1:29:36.200 --> 1:29:38.600]  a voice here and other places that inspire others.
[1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:39.600]  And together we're unstoppable.
[1:29:39.600 --> 1:29:40.600]  Thank you for your courage.
[1:29:40.600 --> 1:29:41.600]  Thank you, sir.
[1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:42.600]  Appreciate you.
[1:29:42.600 --> 1:29:43.600]  Q, great job.
[1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:44.600]  Absolutely.
[1:29:44.600 --> 1:29:45.600]  Thank you.
[1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:46.600]  I called these guys last night about this and it's already huge.
[1:29:46.600 --> 1:29:47.600]  Just wait.
[1:29:47.600 --> 1:29:48.600]  All right.
[1:29:48.600 --> 1:29:49.600]  Coming up, we've got a Washington Insider in studio.
[1:29:49.600 --> 1:29:50.600]  We're on the march.
[1:29:50.600 --> 1:29:53.600]  The Empire is on the run.
[1:29:53.600 --> 1:30:00.120]  Thanks, Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:00.120 --> 1:30:04.240]  The TSA is not satisfied with their current pat down procedure, so they are ramping them
[1:30:04.240 --> 1:30:05.800]  up to get more invasive.
[1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:09.600]  This is in response to a study that found weapons making it past security.
[1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:13.320]  The new pat down will be, quote, more intimate than before.
[1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:17.560]  While TSA screenings are clearly fallible, this new loving pat down procedure will make
[1:30:17.560 --> 1:30:21.960]  it less appealing for people who want to bypass the radiation scanners for health concerns,
[1:30:21.960 --> 1:30:26.080]  so they will just capitulate to the body scanners, which I'm sure will be ramped up and more
[1:30:26.080 --> 1:30:27.600]  intimate soon as well.
[1:30:27.600 --> 1:30:32.400]  Keep in mind, this applies to the random pat down, so this loose net is hardly an effective
[1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:37.480]  strategy unless you're looking to give more TSA agents freedom to grope your wife's chest.
[1:30:37.480 --> 1:30:42.200]  For the first time in human history, CNN's Angela Rye is right about something.
[1:30:42.200 --> 1:30:47.440]  As she wrote a piece titled, Dear TSA, the country is not safer after you grab vaginas
[1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:49.760]  after an experience she had with the TSA.
[1:30:49.760 --> 1:30:51.720]  And that was before the new policy.
[1:30:51.720 --> 1:30:55.640]  Let's all unite behind molestation free air travel for all.
[1:30:55.640 --> 1:30:57.080]  Make flying great again.
[1:30:57.080 --> 1:30:59.480]  This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com.

[1:31:50.640 --> 1:31:54.320]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how Young Jevity and the products
[1:31:54.320 --> 1:31:56.800]  at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[1:31:56.800 --> 1:31:59.680]  Check it out for yourself today.
[1:31:59.680 --> 1:32:04.160]  We have the new product at infowarsleaf.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:08.960]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able
[1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:15.000]  to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from Mustard Seed Extract.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:19.760]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[1:32:19.760 --> 1:32:20.760]  body.
[1:32:20.760 --> 1:32:22.880]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[1:32:22.880 --> 1:32:25.000]  It helps detoxify.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:27.480]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[1:32:27.480 --> 1:32:31.440]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used
[1:32:31.440 --> 1:32:32.440]  all over the body.
[1:32:32.440 --> 1:32:38.520]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[1:32:38.520 --> 1:32:43.840]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[1:32:43.840 --> 1:32:45.600]  I'm taking it now every day.
[1:32:45.600 --> 1:32:46.600]  This is soaking.
[1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:49.080]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[1:32:49.080 --> 1:32:50.840]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[1:32:50.840 --> 1:32:55.480]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price, exclusively available at infowarsleaf.com
[1:32:55.480 --> 1:33:05.960]  or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[1:33:05.960 --> 1:33:30.800]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:36.880]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, halfway into this global transmission, Bruce Fine,
[1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:42.160]  who is a constitutional lawyer, former general counsel at the Federal Communications Commission,
[1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:49.200]  former advisor in the campaign, the head of his foreign affairs for Ron Paul, is here
[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:50.200]  in studio with us.
[1:33:50.200 --> 1:33:53.680]  And he's got so much to get into about what's really happening in Washington and what he
[1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:57.760]  thinks Trump needs to do, the way things really work there, the fact that Trump's only gotten
[1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:06.240]  people in one deep at the federal agencies and what he thinks is really unfolding.
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:10.520]  So what I'm going to let you do here, sir, is we're going to put the camera on you at
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:14.080]  least for at least 10 minutes or I'll never shut up and just get into some of those great
[1:34:14.080 --> 1:34:15.080]  points.
[1:34:15.080 --> 1:34:19.440]  We talked about at breakfast yesterday because this is really the inside scoop on what's
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:20.440]  going on.
[1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:24.440]  You're like 100 and something yards away from the Capitol at your offices with what's really
[1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:28.240]  happening in D.C. in the battle for this Republic.
[1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:34.000]  Here it is the day the Alamo fell on Alamo Day here in Texas as we're covering all this.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:39.360]  And then we will open the phones up for the second half of the next hour for you and get
[1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:40.360]  into some other news.
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:43.920]  But boy, they are there after Trump on every front.
[1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:46.960]  They're saying they didn't wiretapping, but they did.
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:50.480]  There's no Russian evidence, but it doesn't matter.
[1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:55.480]  Usually the power structure is mad at Donald Trump, but talking to you, you're saying that
[1:34:55.480 --> 1:34:56.480]  look, he's a businessman.
[1:34:56.480 --> 1:34:58.880]  He doesn't know how Washington works.
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:00.400]  You've got some really good advice for him.
[1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:04.200]  So I'd say this is a insider, a good insiders, the guy that got rid of the fairness doctrine,
[1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:05.200]  you name it.
[1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:09.600]  The reason we even have free speech and talk radio today, you're here trying to actually
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:14.360]  communicate with the president today and his people so that he understands what you've
[1:35:14.360 --> 1:35:17.960]  seen as an observer or some of the mistakes he's made.
[1:35:17.960 --> 1:35:20.000]  I don't want to call mistakes.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.360]  I just want to focus on going forward.
[1:35:22.360 --> 1:35:24.720]  I think that's the best thing.
[1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:31.080]  And some of these observations are made based upon my experience during the transition from
[1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:35.880]  Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in 1980.
[1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:37.000]  Personnel is policy.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:42.400]  And as you pointed out, Alex, it's critical that you have your team in.
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:44.080]  That's the way that politics works.
[1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:47.680]  You have elections and new people with new ideas come in.
[1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:54.560]  At present, we have really only a handful of Trump-appointed officials running key agencies
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:59.000]  at the Department of Defense, Department of State, at the Justice Department.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:06.080]  The others are either vacant or they're Obama holdovers, and you can't have a changing ship
[1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:12.680]  of state with only a few hands when you're running a $4.3 trillion enterprise.
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:18.760]  There's got over two million federal employees, more than two million federal contractors,
[1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:19.760]  with a handful.
[1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:23.160]  There's too much going on in order to take control of the policy.
[1:36:23.160 --> 1:36:25.760]  And I think that's why there's been so many distractions.
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:32.040]  So the first thing I would recommend that the president consider is filling many of the
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:34.920]  positions at the second and third tier levels.
[1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:39.560]  The Department of Justice, which is critical, Judge Napolitano, I would suggest, would make
[1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:45.200]  a splendid deputy attorney general, Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University,
[1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:49.960]  head office of legal counsel, Richard Epstein, a University of Chicago professor, very much
[1:36:49.960 --> 1:36:56.160]  devoted to property rights, a solicitor general, Tom Campbell, former Republican congressman,
[1:36:56.160 --> 1:36:58.440]  associate attorney general.
[1:36:58.440 --> 1:37:02.440]  These are the kinds of names that have to be gotten in place very quickly.
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:07.080]  Otherwise, you're going to be fighting firefights every single day because you're going to
[1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:09.400]  be dealing with people who are not yours.
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:13.720]  They're not loyal to you, they're holdovers, and they don't have any incentive for your
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:16.120]  administration to succeed at some point.
[1:37:16.120 --> 1:37:22.640]  Well, surely Trump knows this, so why hasn't he been able to, I mean, they admit that the
[1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:27.600]  Justice Department, the State Department are an open rebellion.
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:28.840]  So I mean, what would you do?
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:31.680]  Well, I'd say, good names and send the Congress.
[1:37:31.680 --> 1:37:37.040]  It's not because Congress, there aren't even names to consider for hearings.
[1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:41.880]  And I believe, and it's really based more on circumstantial evidence than otherwise.
[1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:46.280]  Alex, it takes, having been involved in this from Carter to Reagan, you have to have a
[1:37:46.280 --> 1:37:51.320]  wide circle of people who have been in government to know how it works in order to get a list
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:52.320]  of names.
[1:37:52.320 --> 1:37:54.480]  Sure, people you trust that can then bring in teams.
[1:37:54.480 --> 1:37:57.280]  They can bring in teams, and they need to know how government works.
[1:37:57.280 --> 1:38:02.560]  It doesn't work like business, and government oftentimes 2 plus 2 is 5, or it's 3.
[1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:06.720]  And so you need people with different backgrounds and different expertise than those who can
[1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:08.440]  bring in profits in business.
[1:38:08.440 --> 1:38:13.720]  And that means that people, I mean, I've been in Washington almost 50 years, deal with circles
[1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:18.640]  of people, you build up names, people you trust, their judgment.
[1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:23.040]  And from those lists, you then compile, all right, we think these are the slots that could
[1:38:23.040 --> 1:38:24.400]  be filled.
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:29.640]  And I'm not certain that President Trump's, you know, his initial inner circle has that
[1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:30.640]  circle.
[1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:33.960]  Sure, Ron Paul, who I trust, doesn't trust a lot of people, and he trusts you to be the
[1:38:33.960 --> 1:38:37.720]  head of his foreign policy advisor for two, you know, several campaigns.
[1:38:37.720 --> 1:38:38.720]  How'd you meet Ron Paul?
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:39.720]  How did that trust build up?
[1:38:39.720 --> 1:38:44.360]  Well, I met him as a member of Congress, and he used to have roundtables at lunchtime where
[1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:48.560]  he'd have his small group of what you would call his band of brothers who believed in
[1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:53.000]  small government and having presidents be president of the United States like President
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:56.760]  Trump rather than president of the world and say, if you can march them in, you can march
[1:38:56.760 --> 1:38:59.640]  them out to get out of wars.
[1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:05.400]  And I knew, Ron, by communicating with right on Capitol Hill, my offices are within five
[1:39:05.400 --> 1:39:06.760]  minutes of walking distance.
[1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:11.600]  So, and then you learn and you meet their staffs, and that's the kind of relationship
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:14.240]  you build up, but you actually have to physically be there.
[1:39:14.240 --> 1:39:18.840]  It's not developing a relationship by email, you know, it's just sitting down and seeing
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:22.160]  people face to face, get a sense of their judgment.
[1:39:22.160 --> 1:39:27.280]  And that's the kind of personal experience that you need in order to tap in to the circles
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:29.720]  of those who know how to turn the ship of state around.
[1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:30.720]  It's complicated.
[1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:31.720]  It's not easy.
[1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:32.720]  You can't just...
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:33.720]  Sure.
[1:39:33.720 --> 1:39:36.400]  Where would you say we are right now as a republic in world history?
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:39.520]  I think that we are no longer a republic, Alex.
[1:39:39.520 --> 1:39:46.720]  I think that we have so much endowed the executive branch with a limitless power, we resemble
[1:39:46.720 --> 1:39:52.000]  far more the monarchy of King George III than the democracy of George Washington.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:56.800]  I mean, the president goes to war on his own, he spies on his own, he spends money on his
[1:39:56.800 --> 1:39:58.680]  own, he claims that he can do things...
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:03.000]  Is that why the left is so freaked out because they built this political god with all this
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:07.440]  power and now the guy that wants to devolve the power is in that seat?
[1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:08.440]  Yeah.
[1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:13.920]  Because they had...the left had no difficulty at all in accepting all the expansion under
[1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:14.920]  President Obama.
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:20.120]  When he did it, he had no authority to go into Libya, they just turned the...they blinded
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:21.600]  themselves to their eyes.
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:25.880]  When Obama said, okay, there's war against ISIS, I don't need congressional authority.
[1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:30.640]  Even when Congress turned him down in 2013, the liberals said nothing.
[1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:34.880]  When he said he wanted to do a treaty with Iran, that he was going to call an executive
[1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:39.800]  order and violate the treaty clause, the Democrats said, well, that's fine, you don't
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:44.000]  need to actually have to do a treaty anymore like we did with the UN, you can view treaties
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:49.480]  as unfortunate or not, and moreover, Alex, he had the president Obama and his secretary
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:54.200]  of state, John Kerry, testify for Congress that the reason why the rain deal wasn't
[1:40:54.200 --> 1:40:58.200]  going to be a treaty, because he said, it's too hard to get treaties ratified, so he didn't
[1:40:58.200 --> 1:40:59.200]  want to do them anymore.
[1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:04.480]  You know, he said that he was in favor of a treaty concerning disabilities and therefore
[1:41:04.480 --> 1:41:07.040]  he couldn't get it ratified and that was the heck with it.
[1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:10.360]  I mean, that's basically an insurrection against the Constitution, you don't do it
[1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:15.120]  because you can't win, you don't run elections because you can't win, you don't do legislation
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:19.480]  because you can't win, so in the arc, if you want to call a history-having arc as opposed
[1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:23.040]  to linear progressions, we are back to where we started from.
[1:41:23.040 --> 1:41:28.440]  We have come full circle from being a Liberty-centered universe to a government-centered universe,
[1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:31.160]  and this is what we need to end.
[1:41:31.160 --> 1:41:35.480]  I think that was what the American people were saying in 2016.
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:41.000]  And in his inaugural, he said he wants to do that, he's clearly trying to do it, and
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:46.040]  you see the stock market up, small businesses up, but as you said, the Republican Party's
[1:41:46.040 --> 1:41:50.280]  blocking him, the establishment's blocking him, what would you do then if you were President
[1:41:50.280 --> 1:41:51.600]  Trump right now?
[1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:57.040]  But got to go with the personnel first because you can't do things without real people who
[1:41:57.040 --> 1:41:58.040]  make those decisions.
[1:41:58.040 --> 1:42:01.000]  Okay, then why hasn't he done that?
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.080]  Well, I can't get into his head.
[1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:08.160]  I think that he seems to me to be distracted on things that are very minor compared to
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:14.720]  the urgency of getting his people in place and making these decisions.
[1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:18.840]  But generally speaking, Alex, I don't find it constructive to find fault finding in the
[1:42:18.840 --> 1:42:24.280]  past, try to move forward, everybody stumbles, that's part of the game to err as human to
[1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:25.360]  forgive his divine.
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:28.320]  But going forward, there are only so many stumbles.
[1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:29.320]  Focus on it.
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:31.280]  It's not rocket science.
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:32.480]  You need your people who are-
[1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:33.480]  No, I get it.
[1:42:33.480 --> 1:42:37.760]  But Trump actually listens to people he thinks are giving real counsel.
[1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:41.400]  What would you do next if you were in Trump's position?
[1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:44.760]  Go out and find and make these nominations to the second tier.
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:50.320]  I mean, you want to get out of these what I think are ill-conceived wars, I mean, someone
[1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:54.840]  even who is outside the mainstream of the Republicans in the Congress, Walter Jones,
[1:42:54.840 --> 1:42:55.840]  who's on armed services.
[1:42:55.840 --> 1:42:56.840]  He'd be great.
[1:42:56.840 --> 1:42:59.800]  He would be fabulous as Deputy Secretary of State and-
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:00.800]  I've said that.
[1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:01.800]  He's super moral.
[1:43:01.800 --> 1:43:02.800]  And he absolutely is.
[1:43:02.800 --> 1:43:08.160]  And you know, Alex, he is the only one who's written letters of condolence to every single
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:12.640]  family who has had a soldier die since night of every single one.
[1:43:12.640 --> 1:43:13.760]  He's been part of Trump's operation.
[1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:19.280]  And he is the only one, and I go to Congress and their office space.
[1:43:19.280 --> 1:43:21.800]  He's the only one outside of his office.
[1:43:21.800 --> 1:43:26.800]  He's got pictures of everyone in his district who died, who gave that less full measure
[1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:29.040]  of devotion to the United States.
[1:43:29.040 --> 1:43:33.640]  And Nancy Pelosi wanted to have him take those pictures down.
[1:43:33.640 --> 1:43:35.520]  And I helped him say no.
[1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:38.720]  But that would be a fabulous move.
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:41.760]  He said, okay, I am president of the United States.
[1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:47.160]  And Walter would bring back our troops to defend our sea lanes, our land borders, our
[1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:49.000]  airspace, our cyberspace.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:52.720]  They spend their salaries in the United States, not elsewhere.
[1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:59.040]  And people forget that we, at one time, had more influence abroad when we were 13 states
[1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:04.760]  without really any military-industrial complex after we won the Revolutionary War because
[1:44:04.760 --> 1:44:10.160]  we set the example of we the people and all the monarchs and tyrants in Europe and Asia.
[1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:12.200]  They said, how do we compete with the American system?
[1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:13.200]  Absolutely.
[1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:17.120]  And they were fearful that that happened in France, that their people would revolt.
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:19.480]  And we didn't need a single bullet to do that.
[1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:22.800]  We just needed the example and practice it here.
[1:44:22.800 --> 1:44:25.000]  And that's what we need to get back to doing.
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:30.680]  And we understand that we can't change Iraqis into Canadians by bob-dropping bombs on them.
[1:44:30.680 --> 1:44:31.920]  It's not going to happen.
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:35.320]  It's like thinking you can repeal Newton's laws of motion.
[1:44:35.320 --> 1:44:40.760]  I want to get more into the Washington insider gives Trump his warning and analysis.
[1:44:40.760 --> 1:44:46.640]  But just looking at the Democrats themselves, Pelosi thinks that Bush is still in office
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:48.440]  in the same press conference.
[1:44:48.440 --> 1:44:53.000]  Maxine Waters thinks that Putin, with Trump's support, has invaded, quote, Korea, not north
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:54.720]  or south, just Korea.
[1:44:54.720 --> 1:44:57.200]  I mean, I watch him and I think, oh, that was just one press conference.
[1:44:57.200 --> 1:44:58.720]  I'll watch another.
[1:44:58.720 --> 1:45:02.920]  They look like they couldn't manage a cash register at 7-Eleven.
[1:45:02.920 --> 1:45:06.840]  So I'm really concerned about the Republicans are bad as well, but they seem more cunning.
[1:45:06.840 --> 1:45:12.200]  The Democrats, I don't understand why they seem so mentally deranged.
[1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:14.400]  Well, this is Alex.
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:16.160]  My view is let them be there.
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:21.840]  I mean, I think that they are trying to distract themselves from the reasons why Hillary Clinton
[1:45:21.840 --> 1:45:24.680]  lost the presidency.
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:30.480]  And in my mind, fine, go ahead and blind yourself to what everybody could see about the terrible
[1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:36.640]  nature of the policies that she was promoting and the nature of her candidacy itself.
[1:45:36.640 --> 1:45:37.640]  It comes back.
[1:45:37.640 --> 1:45:39.480]  The Democrats didn't win.
[1:45:39.480 --> 1:45:41.560]  They don't control the agenda.
[1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:45.800]  But we are not going to control the agenda unless we have our people confirmed and we
[1:45:45.800 --> 1:45:46.800]  keep coming back.
[1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:49.480]  How much danger do you think Trump's in from them trying to impeach him?
[1:45:49.480 --> 1:45:50.840]  Because they admit that's what they want to do.
[1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:54.360]  Obama's moving in down the street, saying he wants to overthrow him, but then admits
[1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:57.520]  he's wiretapping him, but then says he isn't.
[1:45:57.520 --> 1:46:02.120]  I don't think that he's in danger if he just moves forward with his policy.
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:08.120]  And I don't understand why, you know, in my lifetime when George W. Bush won Alex in 2002,
[1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:12.440]  that was a far more precarious election than Donald Trump's because he went into court,
[1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:13.440]  highly disputed.
[1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:14.440]  Sure.
[1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:15.440]  There was division.
[1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:16.680]  And the president would move forward.
[1:46:16.680 --> 1:46:17.680]  The nation accepted.
[1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:18.680]  All right.
[1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:19.680]  He was elected.
[1:46:19.680 --> 1:46:20.680]  We move on.
[1:46:20.680 --> 1:46:23.040]  No one thinks that the first term of W was illegitimate.
[1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:24.040]  He had two terms.
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:25.040]  We moved on.
[1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:26.200]  We evaluated what he did.
[1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:29.960]  I think that President Trump should just say, and I think the American people are willing
[1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:32.480]  to say, you got elected, fair and square.
[1:46:32.480 --> 1:46:34.000]  Move on with your policies.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  Put your people in.
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  Do what you said.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:39.440]  Well, his approval rating is going up the more they flip out.
[1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:42.960]  So maybe I shouldn't be so concerned, just let them keep spinning around.
[1:46:42.960 --> 1:46:46.200]  Listen, public opinion can be very fickle.
[1:46:46.200 --> 1:46:53.000]  I remember in my lifetime, you probably did too, Alex, when George H.W. Bush came back
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:58.560]  after we destroyed Saddam's forces in Kuwait, he was at 91% approval rate.
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:00.200]  And it dropped down to 40.
[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:01.200]  Yeah.
[1:47:01.200 --> 1:47:02.200]  Yeah.
[1:47:02.200 --> 1:47:03.200]  Overnight.
[1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:06.760]  Don't be preoccupied with the poll ratings from day to day.
[1:47:06.760 --> 1:47:08.760]  Just push forward on the policies.
[1:47:08.760 --> 1:47:11.240]  That was what the American people are going to vote on.
[1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:12.480]  Did you end the war?
[1:47:12.480 --> 1:47:13.960]  Did you cut back government?
[1:47:13.960 --> 1:47:17.120]  Did you eliminate these agencies like Education Department?
[1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:18.120]  Well, Trump knows that.
[1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:22.040]  And, Bannon, I know you've had mixed feelings on, I mean, he really wants to break the back
[1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:26.320]  of collectivism, actually make poor people rich, actually make the globalists not consolidate
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:28.880]  wealth but share it through a free market.
[1:47:28.880 --> 1:47:33.200]  I mean, I think they can do that.
[1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:34.200]  They can.
[1:47:34.200 --> 1:47:39.040]  I mean, there's nothing that inhibits them now any less than at the time that an auguration
[1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:40.040]  happened.
[1:47:40.040 --> 1:47:42.000]  Why are the Democrats fighting so hard then?
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:45.760]  And Republican leadership?
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:50.720]  We have a political culture that's been entrenched for a century.
[1:47:50.720 --> 1:47:54.840]  They don't want the government to slim down.
[1:47:54.840 --> 1:48:00.400]  Their view is that the United States is about making government great rather than the people
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:05.240]  having an opportunity to develop their faculties and pursue their ambitions.
[1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:10.200]  So it's a threat to them when you say, oh, I mean, I'm not going to be part of a $4.3
[1:48:10.200 --> 1:48:12.840]  trillion government agency anymore.
[1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:14.480]  It's going to come back.
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:19.680]  Then their prestige, their status, their financial opportunities become compromised.
[1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:22.680]  They don't have a sense of the connected greatness of humanity.
[1:48:22.680 --> 1:48:25.800]  Well, I don't think that's all part of their own little thing.
[1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:26.800]  Yes.
[1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:27.800]  I think...
[1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:29.240]  Which is transitory and fails.
[1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:31.680]  Only empowering humanity is what goes on.
[1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:38.120]  Well, I think where the deficiency is on both sides, Republican and Democrats in Congress
[1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:45.880]  is failing to recognize that we were unique as a nation in understanding that our legacy,
[1:48:45.880 --> 1:48:51.360]  our greatness comes from the opportunity we want to give all of our individuals here to
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:53.360]  develop their faculties and pursue their ambitions.
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:48:55.680]  Yeah, we're not building pyramids as you love to say to the elites.
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:00.560]  Let's talk about that because, look, if people love North Korea or Venezuela or whatever
[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:04.440]  in socialized states or communist states go there, I mean, couldn't it be, hey, America
[1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:06.200]  is about freewheeling, open society?
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:11.000]  Everybody wanted to come here because this is actually what builds pyramids for humanity,
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  not for the elites.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  Exactly.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  Right.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:19.640]  We have an immigration problem in China, in Russia, North Korea, and people aren't immigrating
[1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:22.880]  to North Korea, and that's a testament to...
[1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:25.480]  But we're so far from what we used to be, Alex.
[1:49:25.480 --> 1:49:26.640]  We're shadow of ourselves.
[1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:29.040]  I mean, give me a real assessment of Trump.
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:30.560]  I mean, I think he means well.
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:31.560]  That's why I admire him.
[1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:33.160]  I mean, he's really trying.
[1:49:33.160 --> 1:49:36.320]  I think we need to focus on less on faulting.
[1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:37.840]  We need to get the job done.
[1:49:37.840 --> 1:49:38.840]  You know, this is...
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:41.880]  I agree, but as a man, I'm asking you real opinion on Donald Trump.
[1:49:41.880 --> 1:49:47.200]  The fact was, he was willing to say things that no one else was willing to say.
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:54.000]  And I think that his ambition has stated to recognize he's president of the United States,
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:58.040]  not of the world, that he's here to represent the people of the United States, not the world.
[1:49:58.040 --> 1:49:59.600]  He's saying, you've been saying forever.
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:00.600]  Yeah.
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:01.600]  I've been saying...
[1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:06.120]  Not only me, George Washington, was saying, this happened for 200 years and took Donald
[1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:12.040]  Trump after it's been in hiatus for like a century, hey, this really is what the United
[1:50:12.040 --> 1:50:13.040]  States is.
[1:50:13.040 --> 1:50:14.040]  Yeah.
[1:50:14.040 --> 1:50:15.040]  You've got elected to represent us.
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:16.040]  So that's how it works.
[1:50:16.040 --> 1:50:17.040]  Yeah.
[1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:18.040]  That's how...
[1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:19.040]  Like a marriage.
[1:50:19.040 --> 1:50:20.040]  You're like, hey, you're married to me, not England.
[1:50:20.040 --> 1:50:21.040]  Yeah.
[1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:22.040]  I call this the...
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:25.080]  If you're in government, and I was there, you're a temporary steward of the liberties
[1:50:25.080 --> 1:50:26.160]  of the people.
[1:50:26.160 --> 1:50:27.960]  They still are your rulers.
[1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:31.840]  And that's why I say the highest office in the land is not the Oval Office.
[1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:34.040]  It's not the Speaker of the House or the Speaker of the Senate.
[1:50:34.040 --> 1:50:36.320]  It's you as citizen of the United States.
[1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:37.320]  You are the highest office.
[1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:38.320]  That's right.
[1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:39.320]  We have to step into that office.
[1:50:39.320 --> 1:50:40.320]  Yes.
[1:50:40.320 --> 1:50:42.440]  And because we, the people, are sovereign, not the government.
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:43.440]  We, the people, are sovereign.
[1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:47.640]  And you know what Thomas Paine described the Patriot at the time of the Revolution?
[1:50:47.640 --> 1:50:51.480]  A patriot saves his country from his government.
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:53.800]  That's what it means to be citizen of the United States.
[1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:57.360]  All right, brothers, fine former Chief Counsel of the Federal Communications Commission.
[1:50:57.360 --> 1:50:59.640]  We'll do this on the other side.
[1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:06.000]  As you know the value of good machines, then it's high time we got together.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:10.560]  We're Bailey Industrial, builders of metal and woodworking equipment, hardworking machines
[1:51:10.560 --> 1:51:11.960]  for hardworking people.

[1:51:58.480 --> 1:52:00.800]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:04.200]  I am a former congressman, physician, and presidential candidate.
[1:52:04.200 --> 1:52:05.880]  The world is in turmoil.
[1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:10.280]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars, and famines are commonplace.
[1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:13.200]  As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events.
[1:52:13.200 --> 1:52:17.360]  However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:21.800]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:24.640]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:28.400]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.
[1:52:28.400 --> 1:52:30.960]  It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[1:52:30.960 --> 1:52:34.520]  With it, we eat healthier and store a little more food.
[1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:39.640]  We freeze dry everything we love to eat, and it lasts up to 25 years.
[1:52:39.640 --> 1:52:41.720]  Who knows what the future will bring?
[1:52:41.720 --> 1:52:46.080]  One thing's certain, my family and I will always have food on the table.
[1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:53.120]  To learn more, go to harvestright.com or call 800-763-5999.

[1:52:59.240 --> 1:53:01.000]  Hi, my name's John Kunkel.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:02.480]  I'm 63 years of age.
[1:53:02.480 --> 1:53:07.000]  I watch several YouTube videos of Steven Hewars and learn what supplements might help me with
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:08.120]  energy and weight loss.
[1:53:08.120 --> 1:53:12.680]  I've now been on the entry of black cumin seed oil, synergy 1, 6 other products from
[1:53:12.680 --> 1:53:14.880]  synergistic nutrition for several weeks now.
[1:53:14.880 --> 1:53:16.480]  I've lost 10 pounds.
[1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:18.200]  My joint pain has been reduced significantly.
[1:53:18.200 --> 1:53:21.360]  I have a lot of energy that I've never had before.
[1:53:21.360 --> 1:53:24.320]  My cravings for sweets are gone, and I'm rarely hungry.
[1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:28.160]  Even my cravings for foods like hamburgers and heavy carbohydrate meals are now gone.
[1:53:28.160 --> 1:53:29.880]  This is the only thing that's worked for me.
[1:53:29.880 --> 1:53:33.680]  I was seriously considering bariatric surgery, but that's out the window now.
[1:53:33.680 --> 1:53:35.920]  Thank you so much, synergistic nutrition.

[1:54:23.160 --> 1:54:34.440]  All right, Bruce Fiennes with us 30 minutes to the next hour, and I'm going to open the
[1:54:34.440 --> 1:54:35.440]  phones up.
[1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:38.680]  There are no insurers hosting the fourth hour.
[1:54:38.680 --> 1:54:42.600]  We have Chris Ruddy, who met with the president over the weekend in Mar-a-Lago, coming out
[1:54:42.600 --> 1:54:47.840]  just how angry he is, head of Newsmax, CEO of Newsmax, coming out how angry he is, that
[1:54:47.840 --> 1:54:50.040]  sessions recused himself.
[1:54:50.040 --> 1:54:54.280]  I want to get into getting rid of agency, something you've talked a lot about.
[1:54:54.280 --> 1:54:55.880]  We all know Congress has a low approval rating.
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:54:56.880]  They passed the buck.
[1:54:56.880 --> 1:54:57.880]  They give us the bureaucracy.
[1:54:57.880 --> 1:55:02.520]  For the president, you're saying how the president will go right to them and demand they do something
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:04.520]  and make them take action.
[1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:06.600]  I understand the optics.
[1:55:06.600 --> 1:55:09.440]  He wants to take action with what he can right up front, but as you said, a new president
[1:55:09.440 --> 1:55:14.440]  comes in and gets wiped away, needs to be statutorily or in the law changed.
[1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:20.120]  But specifically, just looking at the overall atmosphere, all these Democratic attacks and
[1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:28.680]  Republican attacks on Trump wanting to keep their power, is that going anywhere?
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:30.600]  I don't think it's going anywhere at all.
[1:55:30.600 --> 1:55:35.320]  I don't think that the American people are rallying behind the Democrats and giving them
[1:55:35.320 --> 1:55:44.320]  fabulous approval ratings and having huge demonstrations in favor of what the Democrats
[1:55:44.320 --> 1:55:45.320]  want.
[1:55:45.320 --> 1:55:46.320]  So we're seeing spoiled entitlement.
[1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:47.320]  Absolutely.
[1:55:47.320 --> 1:55:52.920]  It's grown up for so many years, Alex, for, I've been there for 50 years and every single
[1:55:52.920 --> 1:55:57.240]  year the government got bigger and bigger than maybe it borrowed the money rather than
[1:55:57.240 --> 1:56:00.600]  raised it by revenue that never got smaller.
[1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:08.080]  And it always, I think, lost sight of the fact that as the United States, our greatness
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:13.160]  is, say, it's not pyramids, it's giving everyone an opportunity to develop their faculties
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:14.160]  of presumption.
[1:56:14.160 --> 1:56:15.960]  It's not letting crony capitalist monopolies take over.
[1:56:15.960 --> 1:56:20.280]  Yeah, not letting the big banks, not letting the military-industrial conflict, and going
[1:56:20.280 --> 1:56:23.720]  back to the fundamental principle, it's great.
[1:56:23.720 --> 1:56:27.440]  We succeed when everybody gets to chart their own destiny.
[1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:30.840]  Captain of their fate, you don't get to tell me how I'd live my life.
[1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:31.840]  I don't tell you.
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:34.840]  That creates the secret sauce of the real diversity.
[1:56:34.840 --> 1:56:36.920]  Oh, yeah, the diversity in the genius.
[1:56:36.920 --> 1:56:42.680]  We need the genius of people building better mousetraps, not working for the CIA or the
[1:56:42.680 --> 1:56:46.000]  NSA or the military trying to kill people.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  That's the genius.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  That's what made us into a fabulous nation within hundreds of years.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  Exactly.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:54.320]  If we have all the fabulous inventions of the big, beautiful cities and technology, everyone's
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:55.560]  going to follow us regardless.
[1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:56.560]  Absolutely.
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:56:57.560]  Soft power.
[1:56:57.560 --> 1:57:01.640]  Yeah, we wouldn't need to have, in fact, we would attract so much brains out of the
[1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:03.120]  rest of the world.
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:04.120]  They wouldn't have.
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:07.840]  You know, Eisenhower criticized the military-industrial complex as he presided over its takeover.
[1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:11.280]  But they had the whiz kid functions and all about the people there, but that all kind
[1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:12.280]  of stalled out.
[1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:13.280]  It did.
[1:57:13.280 --> 1:57:21.360]  I mean, the understanding that the military-industrial complex, well, it was almost unique to President
[1:57:21.360 --> 1:57:22.880]  Heiser because he had been there.
[1:57:22.880 --> 1:57:26.520]  He knew about it and no one could criticize him because he was there d-day.
[1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:28.360]  You know, you're not going to criticize him.
[1:57:28.360 --> 1:57:32.000]  Other presidents, they got taken over and he bring in all these whiz kids and they drive
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  us into Vietnam and these useless wars that accomplish nothing other than causes to go
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:42.200]  bankrupt and make us less safe instead of recognize we need invincible self-defense.
[1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:43.440]  We're here at home.
[1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:44.440]  No one's going to destroy us.
[1:57:44.440 --> 1:57:49.000]  To protect all the incredible brain trust in what we built and then everyone's going
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:52.200]  to be begging to sell us their raw materials and begging to be part of them.
[1:57:52.200 --> 1:57:56.280]  Yeah, and they will come over in the hordes because that's the opportunity.
[1:57:56.280 --> 1:57:57.760]  That's what happened in the 1800s.
[1:57:57.760 --> 1:58:00.560]  We will get the best and the brightest from all over the world.
[1:58:00.560 --> 1:58:04.760]  You know, globalism wants us to be its military arm, take the blame, then the UN and the globalists
[1:58:04.760 --> 1:58:08.760]  become the groups that hand out the technology so they become America when they're the opposite
[1:58:08.760 --> 1:58:09.760]  of it.
[1:58:09.760 --> 1:58:11.160]  Yeah, and they want us to defend the whole world.
[1:58:11.160 --> 1:58:12.960]  Well, we have an obligation to go everywhere.
[1:58:12.960 --> 1:58:16.880]  No, we have an obligation to the American people because we are the ones who are the
[1:58:16.880 --> 1:58:17.880]  opposite.
[1:58:17.880 --> 1:58:19.600]  And they say Trump's anti-nato just because he says pay part of it.
[1:58:19.600 --> 1:58:23.440]  Yeah, which in my judgment, that's a ridiculous argument to make.
[1:58:23.440 --> 1:58:27.160]  And anyway, in my view, NATO needs to defend itself.
[1:58:27.160 --> 1:58:29.920]  You know, we have no obligation to defend them.
[1:58:29.920 --> 1:58:32.600]  We know that they're not there in our best interests.
[1:58:32.600 --> 1:58:33.920]  They're there in their best interests.
[1:58:33.920 --> 1:58:34.920]  They take advantage of us.
[1:58:34.920 --> 1:58:37.000]  I'm in the EU as a criminal group.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:40.960]  Let's come back in 70 seconds, talk about agencies to get rid of and we've got the British
[1:58:40.960 --> 1:58:41.960]  minister.
[1:58:41.960 --> 1:58:42.960]  Thank you.
[1:58:42.960 --> 1:58:44.960]  We've got that clip right here with the EU tyranny.
[1:58:44.960 --> 1:58:47.960]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:47.960 --> 1:58:56.320]  There was a mighty nation, rest above all of creation, Charlie Daniels, he's always loved
[1:58:56.320 --> 1:58:57.320]  America.
[1:58:57.320 --> 1:58:58.320]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[1:58:58.320 --> 1:59:03.400]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[1:59:03.400 --> 1:59:06.200]  Individual rights will have to take a backseat to the collective.
[1:59:06.200 --> 1:59:08.200]  Well, you know, the next move is going to be, don't you?
[1:59:08.200 --> 1:59:10.200]  It's going to be coming after you, Ben.
[1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:12.920]  I tell you, it ain't going to sit well down my way at all.
[1:59:12.920 --> 1:59:13.920]  It ain't going to sit well.
[1:59:13.920 --> 1:59:16.480]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[1:59:16.480 --> 1:59:17.480]  They lost.
[1:59:17.480 --> 1:59:18.480]  We won.
[1:59:18.480 --> 1:59:20.480]  Want to see what trumps up against.
[1:59:20.480 --> 1:59:22.000]  It's time to ride, boys.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:23.480]  We need a thousand pallet of beers.
[1:59:23.480 --> 1:59:29.960]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[1:59:29.960 --> 1:59:35.760]  And beef was for supper, revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings
[1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:36.760]  on demand.
[1:59:36.760 --> 1:59:42.040]  The DVDs now available, starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry
[1:59:42.040 --> 1:59:43.040]  Boykin.
[1:59:43.040 --> 1:59:46.840]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[1:59:46.840 --> 1:59:47.840]  Revelation.
[1:59:47.840 --> 1:59:48.840]  The movie.info.
[1:59:48.840 --> 1:59:52.640]  Let's fix it.
[1:59:52.640 --> 2:00:18.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[2:00:18.120 --> 2:00:26.920]  Alex Jones is a fact, and you know it's true.
[2:00:26.920 --> 2:00:36.440]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up, Bruce Slimes, our guest, former foreign
[2:00:36.440 --> 2:00:41.120]  affairs advisor to Ron Paul, presidential campaign, former lead counsel of the Federal
[2:00:41.120 --> 2:00:45.920]  Communications Commission, helping to create talk radio by getting rid of that regulation.
[2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:50.840]  As you pointed out, that was all just the interpretation of it.
[2:00:50.840 --> 2:00:51.840]  It wasn't even there.
[2:00:51.840 --> 2:00:54.000]  It was always just a bluff.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:59.480]  The Fairness Doctor and Alex originated by Democratic-controlled Federal Communications
[2:00:59.480 --> 2:01:01.400]  Commission in the late 1940s.
[2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:06.400]  It wasn't a statutory requirement, but over the years, by the time I became General Counsel,
[2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:11.200]  it was accepted or wrongly that, well, it was a mandate by Congress.
[2:01:11.200 --> 2:01:17.080]  It says no, Congress has never ratified it, it acknowledged it existed, and that is what
[2:01:17.080 --> 2:01:21.760]  caused me then to initiate the process that led to the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine.
[2:01:21.760 --> 2:01:29.240]  But it shows how expectations can crystallize wrongly into convictions because it happens
[2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:34.680]  to favor certain kinds of people, and that's a reason why you need to get your own people
[2:01:34.680 --> 2:01:39.480]  in place who will take second and third looks at this as this really required.
[2:01:39.480 --> 2:01:43.880]  My view is, if you probably went to other agencies, there are probably dozens similar
[2:01:43.880 --> 2:01:47.960]  to the Fairness Doctrine that are lying around under the misapprehension that they're required
[2:01:47.960 --> 2:01:48.960]  by Congress.
[2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:49.960]  Well, here's what we know.
[2:01:49.960 --> 2:01:54.920]  The biggest government the world's ever seen keeps growing, growing, growing like cancer.
[2:01:54.920 --> 2:01:58.560]  As declared the people, the enemy, it's so arrogant, we've got to start cutting agencies.
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:00.160]  What would you do there if you were Trump?
[2:02:00.160 --> 2:02:04.800]  Well, one of the things that especially fits into the current controversies, I don't see
[2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:07.240]  any reason why we even need a CIA.
[2:02:07.240 --> 2:02:10.200]  An essential intelligence agency can be abolished.
[2:02:10.200 --> 2:02:13.460]  As created in 1947, it makes mistakes all the time.
[2:02:13.460 --> 2:02:17.320]  Its first covert action was to interfere with the foreign election in Italy of all places
[2:02:17.320 --> 2:02:20.920]  like where the Italy went went otherwise.
[2:02:20.920 --> 2:02:25.040]  It's not, you know, it thought Gorbachev is going to fall after he couldn't possibly
[2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:26.240]  be a reformer.
[2:02:26.240 --> 2:02:27.880]  I don't see any reason.
[2:02:27.880 --> 2:02:33.840]  We just, you know, the public domain information is good enough for anybody with any sense
[2:02:33.840 --> 2:02:36.240]  to project what's going to happen in the future.
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:40.320]  We need battlefield intelligence, but the military can do that.
[2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:42.360]  So that's one thing that could be useful.
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:44.000]  Then he ought to go down the agenda.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:45.640]  We don't need an education department.
[2:02:45.640 --> 2:02:47.920]  We survive well and prospered without one for two years.
[2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:52.960]  We do not need centralized education, teaching us two plus two equals five.
[2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:53.960]  Yeah.
[2:02:53.960 --> 2:02:59.080]  And moreover, and even believing that microaggressions or something is part of the educational process.
[2:02:59.080 --> 2:03:03.600]  But putting that aside, the education department can go, commerce department can go, labor
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:09.240]  department can go, the department of energy, except its nuclear weapons need to be transferred
[2:03:09.240 --> 2:03:10.960]  over to the military.
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:12.120]  All these agencies go.
[2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:15.360]  We're saving tens of billions of dollars, really.
[2:03:15.360 --> 2:03:20.000]  And I think even more important, Alex, is failing to recognize what the standard ought
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.840]  to be for creating an agency, for creating a law.
[2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:27.040]  Every time you have a law, you're compromising the liberties of the American people with
[2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:30.120]  saying you can't do this anymore, mean more of your tax money.
[2:03:30.120 --> 2:03:33.760]  And we need to have a standard that says we don't create agencies.
[2:03:33.760 --> 2:03:40.480]  We don't enact laws unless it's very critical to protecting American people from domestic
[2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:41.480]  or external aggression.
[2:03:41.480 --> 2:03:42.480]  Exactly.
[2:03:42.480 --> 2:03:45.760]  They're only there to serve the people and the continuity of the overall sovereignty
[2:03:45.760 --> 2:03:46.760]  of the nation.
[2:03:46.760 --> 2:03:49.720]  They're not just there to tax and destroy and control people.
[2:03:49.720 --> 2:03:51.440]  And build bridges to nowhere.
[2:03:51.440 --> 2:03:52.880]  I mean, that's simply wrong.
[2:03:52.880 --> 2:03:54.000]  And I come back.
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:58.040]  What it means to be an American is that you get to chart your own destiny.
[2:03:58.040 --> 2:03:59.840]  You get to decide what life you want.
[2:03:59.840 --> 2:04:01.480]  Other people don't get you, tell you do it.
[2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:04.720]  And it's the kind of spirit, it's a variation of Huey Long.
[2:04:04.720 --> 2:04:08.080]  Every man or woman's a king and queen, but no one wears a crown.
[2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:09.480]  That's what America's about.
[2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:15.360]  It's not about building legacies and building pyramids and monuments and this and that.
[2:04:15.360 --> 2:04:19.920]  It's the freedom and liberties of the American people to say, I lived a life that I was able
[2:04:19.920 --> 2:04:24.840]  to chart, and I decided in my way I made my ears, government, get out of the way other
[2:04:24.840 --> 2:04:29.840]  than making sure that aggression doesn't destroy me.
[2:04:29.840 --> 2:04:30.840]  We're going to go to break and come back.
[2:04:30.840 --> 2:04:35.080]  I want to ask you Bruce Feim, getting at all the points you were making in breakfast the
[2:04:35.080 --> 2:04:40.240]  other morning about just the way the way government works, the different things that are happening,
[2:04:40.240 --> 2:04:44.680]  the different angles and just your message to Trump and the American people in general
[2:04:44.680 --> 2:04:48.240]  about how we can win this fight against the collectivist in this key chapter.
[2:04:48.240 --> 2:04:51.400]  And also want to ask you, where does it go if Trump fails?
[2:04:51.400 --> 2:04:59.920]  As I look at the opposition and they are just abled, they are very, very bizarre people.
[2:04:59.920 --> 2:05:04.600]  I'm beginning to think Mexico's border policy and immigration policy is whatever goes against
[2:05:04.600 --> 2:05:05.600]  Trump.
[2:05:05.600 --> 2:05:10.200]  In an unprecedented move, the Mexican government is now paying $50 million to give legal support
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:12.960]  to Mexican nationals living in the U.S. illegally.
[2:05:12.960 --> 2:05:16.960]  So Mexico won't pay for a wall, but they will pay for people who leave Mexico for the United
[2:05:16.960 --> 2:05:18.960]  States, I guess because it's better.
[2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:21.840]  If you do so legally, though, they have no funding for you.
[2:05:21.840 --> 2:05:25.680]  All 50 Mexican consulates to the U.S. are launching legal assistance centers for Mexican
[2:05:25.680 --> 2:05:29.040]  nationals living in the U.S. illegally who are fearing deportation.
[2:05:29.040 --> 2:05:33.120]  In contrast, however, I cannot go to Mexico and have the U.S. government pay any legal
[2:05:33.120 --> 2:05:35.680]  fees I may incur for migrating illegally.
[2:05:35.680 --> 2:05:38.760]  And why would Mexico pay people who left their country?
[2:05:38.760 --> 2:05:41.640]  Is Mexico that bad they just refuse to go back?
[2:05:41.640 --> 2:05:45.800]  Or are the people that left Mexico that bad they're paying to keep them out?
[2:05:45.800 --> 2:05:51.200]  No, I think any anti-Trump politicians from anywhere on Earth have now abandoned all logic,
[2:05:51.200 --> 2:05:56.200]  all common sense, all true policy and diplomacy, an attempt to go against anything President
[2:05:56.200 --> 2:05:57.200]  Trump tries to do.
[2:05:57.200 --> 2:06:00.080]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[2:06:00.080 --> 2:06:05.120]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:08.480]  before it became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk.
[2:06:08.480 --> 2:06:13.680]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLive.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[2:06:13.680 --> 2:06:19.880]  bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[2:06:19.880 --> 2:06:21.320]  great tasting formula.
[2:06:21.320 --> 2:06:22.320]  Caveman.
[2:06:22.320 --> 2:06:26.240]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[2:06:26.240 --> 2:06:30.240]  superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[2:06:30.240 --> 2:06:34.240]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you used the meat for sustenance,
[2:06:34.240 --> 2:06:39.560]  the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength, from the outside structure full
[2:06:39.560 --> 2:06:43.480]  of minerals and Kiko factors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[2:06:43.480 --> 2:06:46.040]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[2:06:46.040 --> 2:06:50.360]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[2:06:50.360 --> 2:06:54.000]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:57.480]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself,
[2:06:57.480 --> 2:07:25.120]  and ForestLives.com today.

[1:51:39.940 --> 2:08:34.520]  dinner spent some time with the president.
[2:08:34.520 --> 2:08:39.120]  He's been a member of Mar-a-Lago for 20 years, president's club, he's in the news saying
[2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:42.560]  he met with the president, he is so mad about the wiretaps because they told him you're
[2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:46.200]  being wiretapped, Congress said nothing was found on the wiretaps, and the media goes,
[2:08:46.200 --> 2:08:48.700]  Trump's insane, there were no wiretaps.
[2:08:48.700 --> 2:08:51.900]  Thousands of news articles admitting the illegal wiretaps.
[2:08:51.900 --> 2:08:54.540]  Obama finds nothing, Trump says that's illegal.
[2:08:54.540 --> 2:08:56.140]  So they say there are no wiretaps.
[2:08:56.140 --> 2:08:58.860]  It shows the systemic deception.
[2:08:58.860 --> 2:09:03.340]  Even George W. Bush's former attorney general says,
[2:09:03.340 --> 2:09:04.500]  no, there's wiretaps.
[2:09:04.500 --> 2:09:06.220]  They got CIA people and they got Congress saying,
[2:09:06.220 --> 2:09:07.300]  of course there's wiretaps.
[2:09:07.300 --> 2:09:08.700]  We reviewed them.
[2:09:08.700 --> 2:09:11.180]  So again, look at the Democrats.
[2:09:11.180 --> 2:09:12.860]  I used to hate Republicans and Democrats, I still do,
[2:09:12.860 --> 2:09:15.900]  but the Democrats themselves are just such liars.
[2:09:15.900 --> 2:09:18.900]  Bruce Feind, I mean, can you comment on that controversy
[2:09:18.900 --> 2:09:20.060]  and just where you see it going?
[2:09:20.060 --> 2:09:22.740]  Because it's so crazy to admit they're wiretapping,
[2:09:22.740 --> 2:09:24.540]  but then say they're not wiretapping.
[2:09:25.700 --> 2:09:28.180]  Well, I worked on the Ed Snowden issue.
[2:09:28.180 --> 2:09:32.420]  And the fact is, to say that we don't intercept
[2:09:32.420 --> 2:09:33.780]  conversations and communicate.
[2:09:33.780 --> 2:09:34.620]  I forgot about that.
[2:09:34.620 --> 2:09:35.620]  Had you done work with Snowden?
[2:09:35.620 --> 2:09:37.940]  Yeah, I represented his father and was-
[2:09:37.940 --> 2:09:40.020]  I forget all the great, you're such a big way.
[2:09:40.020 --> 2:09:40.860]  You know so much stuff.
[2:09:40.860 --> 2:09:41.700]  Tell folks about that.
[2:09:41.700 --> 2:09:45.180]  Yeah, so, I mean, the revelations are that the,
[2:09:45.180 --> 2:09:49.700]  the NSA, they intercept virtually everything.
[2:09:49.700 --> 2:09:51.180]  You know, they collect everything.
[2:09:51.180 --> 2:09:52.900]  They have so much information,
[2:09:52.900 --> 2:09:54.740]  they can't even sort through it.
[2:09:54.740 --> 2:09:56.220]  And they don't make exceptions.
[2:09:56.220 --> 2:09:58.060]  I mean, I've spoke to somebody.
[2:09:58.060 --> 2:10:01.100]  They even intercept conversations that members of Congress
[2:10:01.100 --> 2:10:03.340]  have in their own offices.
[2:10:03.340 --> 2:10:06.060]  They intercept communications that judges have
[2:10:06.060 --> 2:10:06.900]  and lawyers have.
[2:10:06.900 --> 2:10:10.260]  It's indiscriminate, vacuum cleans everything.
[2:10:10.260 --> 2:10:14.500]  And they never disputed that what Snowden revealed
[2:10:14.500 --> 2:10:15.740]  wasn't accurate.
[2:10:15.740 --> 2:10:18.380]  They just said, well, but he wasn't the one person
[2:10:18.380 --> 2:10:20.420]  who ought to disclose it.
[2:10:20.420 --> 2:10:21.460]  All of it's true.
[2:10:21.460 --> 2:10:22.300]  It's true.
[2:10:22.300 --> 2:10:26.060]  And remember, you know, about the denials here.
[2:10:26.060 --> 2:10:30.140]  It was March of 2015, I believe,
[2:10:30.140 --> 2:10:33.260]  when then the director of national intelligence
[2:10:33.260 --> 2:10:36.220]  asked under oath in an open Senate hearing
[2:10:36.220 --> 2:10:38.860]  whether the agency was collecting data
[2:10:38.860 --> 2:10:40.220]  on millions of Americans.
[2:10:40.220 --> 2:10:41.900]  James Clapper was his name.
[2:10:41.900 --> 2:10:42.740]  He said no.
[2:10:42.740 --> 2:10:43.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:10:43.580 --> 2:10:45.180]  And he said no, you know,
[2:10:45.180 --> 2:10:47.140]  because he's collecting data on hundreds of,
[2:10:47.140 --> 2:10:49.260]  in fact, every American citizen.
[2:10:49.260 --> 2:10:51.300]  He says no.
[2:10:51.300 --> 2:10:53.580]  And he was told in advance, I know,
[2:10:53.580 --> 2:10:56.140]  by Senator Ron Wyden that to expect the question,
[2:10:56.140 --> 2:10:57.900]  it wasn't an ambuscade.
[2:10:57.900 --> 2:10:58.740]  So what do you mean?
[2:10:58.740 --> 2:10:59.580]  He was a mistake.
[2:10:59.580 --> 2:11:01.300]  So the same guy now says, no,
[2:11:01.300 --> 2:11:02.140]  our tapping of Trump,
[2:11:02.140 --> 2:11:05.420]  even though they admit they have the communicates.
[2:11:05.420 --> 2:11:07.980]  I wouldn't believe anything the NSA said.
[2:11:07.980 --> 2:11:08.820]  No, I get that.
[2:11:08.820 --> 2:11:10.740]  But why do they lie when they know they're gonna get caught?
[2:11:10.740 --> 2:11:12.780]  It's like saying,
[2:11:12.780 --> 2:11:13.980]  you're not wearing a blue jacket.
[2:11:13.980 --> 2:11:15.180]  Well, you are wearing one.
[2:11:16.420 --> 2:11:17.820]  I can't get in their heads.
[2:11:17.820 --> 2:11:20.260]  It's a way that I suppose to distract the tension,
[2:11:20.260 --> 2:11:22.180]  but I just keep coming back.
[2:11:22.180 --> 2:11:25.220]  I think Alex, the American people,
[2:11:25.220 --> 2:11:27.460]  they deserve better than this.
[2:11:27.460 --> 2:11:29.580]  They deserve getting their country back.
[2:11:29.580 --> 2:11:31.940]  They deserve them being in the cat bird seat.
[2:11:31.940 --> 2:11:34.820]  Well, who believes Trump is on the Russian control?
[2:11:34.820 --> 2:11:37.140]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[2:11:38.860 --> 2:11:40.220]  I keep coming back.
[2:11:40.220 --> 2:11:43.100]  The policies are the United States making
[2:11:43.100 --> 2:11:45.660]  the American people empowered.
[2:11:45.660 --> 2:11:46.900]  They control their life.
[2:11:46.900 --> 2:11:48.060]  They have fair opportunities.
[2:11:48.060 --> 2:11:50.540]  They shouldn't be taxed to support all these government
[2:11:50.540 --> 2:11:52.900]  boondoggles that are totally extraneous.
[2:11:52.900 --> 2:11:55.980]  So what it means to be American in invincible self-defense.
[2:11:55.980 --> 2:11:57.340]  And I think that, you know,
[2:11:57.340 --> 2:11:58.860]  you're raising these issues, Alex,
[2:11:58.860 --> 2:12:00.060]  and they're good issues,
[2:12:00.060 --> 2:12:02.860]  but they're largely distractions from the larger issue
[2:12:02.860 --> 2:12:05.060]  of whether we're gonna survive as a republic.
[2:12:05.060 --> 2:12:07.100]  We are about ready to hit the Titanic.
[2:12:07.100 --> 2:12:08.820]  Let's talk about hitting the Titanic,
[2:12:08.820 --> 2:12:10.460]  with the real numbers, the real facts.
[2:12:10.460 --> 2:12:11.940]  What would have happened if Hillary got in?
[2:12:11.940 --> 2:12:12.820]  That's a Titanic.
[2:12:12.820 --> 2:12:14.100]  Yeah, it would have been Titanic.
[2:12:14.100 --> 2:12:16.940]  We'd probably already be at war with Russia in China.
[2:12:16.940 --> 2:12:18.580]  You know, our 20 trillion deficit
[2:12:18.580 --> 2:12:21.340]  would probably be at like 22 or 23 or 24.
[2:12:21.340 --> 2:12:22.620]  And again, why would the elites want that?
[2:12:22.620 --> 2:12:23.940]  Cause she admitted she wanted war.
[2:12:23.940 --> 2:12:24.900]  What the hell is that?
[2:12:24.900 --> 2:12:26.340]  But it'd be okay cause she's a woman, though.
[2:12:26.340 --> 2:12:27.420]  Well, and a Democrat.
[2:12:27.420 --> 2:12:29.380]  I mean, Obama did war.
[2:12:29.380 --> 2:12:31.620]  Obama came in and he ended with more.
[2:12:31.620 --> 2:12:34.420]  So a Democrat blows the earth up, it's still liberal.
[2:12:34.420 --> 2:12:35.860]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:12:35.860 --> 2:12:39.300]  So that wasn't something that they opposed.
[2:12:39.300 --> 2:12:40.940]  There was not a single person.
[2:12:40.940 --> 2:12:42.580]  I wrote so many articles saying,
[2:12:42.580 --> 2:12:44.220]  Hillary is the war president.
[2:12:44.220 --> 2:12:46.900]  And this is, ever since she's been in Washington,
[2:12:46.900 --> 2:12:49.060]  she's never opposed any war ever.
[2:12:49.060 --> 2:12:51.020]  You know, even though her specialty is, say,
[2:12:51.020 --> 2:12:53.700]  turning children into orphans and wives into widows,
[2:12:53.700 --> 2:12:56.460]  nobody ever said anything about one of her closest,
[2:12:56.460 --> 2:12:57.300]  you know, intellectual men.
[2:12:57.300 --> 2:12:58.740]  I saw he died.
[2:12:58.740 --> 2:12:59.580]  He died, yeah.
[2:12:59.580 --> 2:13:00.420]  That's right.
[2:13:00.420 --> 2:13:01.260]  Sound like Julius Caesar.
[2:13:01.260 --> 2:13:02.100]  I'm really good at killing people, man.
[2:13:02.100 --> 2:13:05.220]  And one of her soulmates was Marilyn Albright,
[2:13:05.220 --> 2:13:07.140]  who when she's serving under Clinton was asked,
[2:13:07.140 --> 2:13:09.580]  well, what do you think about the 500,000 Iraqi children
[2:13:09.580 --> 2:13:10.420]  who-
[2:13:10.420 --> 2:13:11.260]  Good price to pay?
[2:13:11.260 --> 2:13:12.340]  Yeah, she says, well, it was worth it.
[2:13:12.340 --> 2:13:14.020]  She didn't shed a tear.
[2:13:14.020 --> 2:13:14.860]  I mean-
[2:13:14.860 --> 2:13:15.900]  They get off on that.
[2:13:15.900 --> 2:13:16.740]  Yeah.
[2:13:16.740 --> 2:13:18.300]  And no one says anything.
[2:13:18.300 --> 2:13:20.500]  500 Iraqi children under five,
[2:13:20.500 --> 2:13:21.580]  they were guilty of what?
[2:13:21.580 --> 2:13:22.420]  500,000.
[2:13:22.420 --> 2:13:23.260]  Yeah.
[2:13:23.260 --> 2:13:24.100]  500,000.
[2:13:25.100 --> 2:13:27.740]  So that's what, I think that's what we had been in.
[2:13:27.740 --> 2:13:31.380]  And unfortunately, if Hillary in the White House,
[2:13:31.380 --> 2:13:33.260]  you wouldn't hear a peep out of the New York Times,
[2:13:33.260 --> 2:13:35.020]  Washington Post, silent.
[2:13:35.020 --> 2:13:36.220]  The thing about Albright and all of them
[2:13:36.220 --> 2:13:38.100]  is they never got their hands dirty.
[2:13:38.100 --> 2:13:41.140]  We were covered in Bilderberg in like 2008,
[2:13:41.140 --> 2:13:43.300]  when Obama and Hillary were inside of it in Chantilly
[2:13:43.300 --> 2:13:44.580]  in the media, remember for a day,
[2:13:44.580 --> 2:13:45.540]  couldn't find where they were at?
[2:13:45.540 --> 2:13:47.780]  We were there, media wouldn't cover it.
[2:13:47.780 --> 2:13:49.220]  She drove in in a convertible,
[2:13:49.220 --> 2:13:50.820]  looked at like a hundred of us protesting,
[2:13:50.820 --> 2:13:53.860]  freaked out, panicked, drove in and drove out panicked.
[2:13:53.860 --> 2:13:55.340]  And that was in the newspaper.
[2:13:55.340 --> 2:13:57.420]  That she just saw a hundred people standing there
[2:13:57.420 --> 2:13:58.380]  and got so scared.
[2:13:58.380 --> 2:14:00.180]  She loves 500,000 dead kids,
[2:14:00.180 --> 2:14:02.340]  brags about it, kind of gets sexually excited.
[2:14:02.340 --> 2:14:03.980]  You know, with Leslie Stahl, how about dead kids?
[2:14:03.980 --> 2:14:05.300]  Because she's powerful now.
[2:14:05.300 --> 2:14:07.900]  It's like the Prince of Darkness, Richard Pearl,
[2:14:07.900 --> 2:14:08.740]  has been reported on.
[2:14:08.740 --> 2:14:09.580]  Well, at cocktail parties,
[2:14:09.580 --> 2:14:10.580]  a walk up to a good look at women,
[2:14:10.580 --> 2:14:12.980]  he goes, I tell a lot of people,
[2:14:12.980 --> 2:14:14.700]  and the women go, man, you're really creepy.
[2:14:14.700 --> 2:14:16.660]  Like they don't get women aren't into that.
[2:14:16.660 --> 2:14:18.860]  And it's just like these people,
[2:14:18.860 --> 2:14:21.180]  but Pearl couldn't find his way out of a wet paper bag.
[2:14:21.180 --> 2:14:24.260]  But he walks, he calls himself the Prince of Darkness.
[2:14:24.260 --> 2:14:25.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:14:25.460 --> 2:14:27.740]  So what do you want to comment on that?
[2:14:27.740 --> 2:14:29.100]  Well, it's unfortunate,
[2:14:29.100 --> 2:14:32.620]  but I do think that women are so preoccupied
[2:14:32.620 --> 2:14:34.740]  with just saying, okay, we can be equal.
[2:14:34.740 --> 2:14:36.260]  They don't ask, well, what do you, if you think-
[2:14:36.260 --> 2:14:37.940]  They think being equal is being a warmonger.
[2:14:37.940 --> 2:14:40.780]  Yeah, that they can be equal in being war
[2:14:40.780 --> 2:14:42.700]  and killing people and wasting money.
[2:14:42.700 --> 2:14:44.620]  Well, I don't view that as being great.
[2:14:44.620 --> 2:14:46.460]  I don't view that as vindication.
[2:14:46.460 --> 2:14:47.300]  And we hear this liberal thing,
[2:14:47.300 --> 2:14:49.700]  not bashing women that women are gonna stop war in history.
[2:14:49.700 --> 2:14:51.220]  Women are in charge of more wars.
[2:14:51.220 --> 2:14:52.540]  Yeah.
[2:14:52.540 --> 2:14:55.540]  Well, I don't know, if you look at history,
[2:14:55.540 --> 2:14:56.980]  you're exactly right, Alex,
[2:14:56.980 --> 2:14:59.500]  that Catherine the Great was not renowned
[2:14:59.500 --> 2:15:04.500]  as a Catherine who was a peacemaker in Russia.
[2:15:04.980 --> 2:15:06.020]  Leaders often-
[2:15:06.020 --> 2:15:07.060]  Queen Elizabeth, same deal.
[2:15:07.060 --> 2:15:07.900]  Yeah.
[2:15:07.900 --> 2:15:09.020]  Queen Elizabeth, the Spanish-
[2:15:09.020 --> 2:15:10.100]  They always want to show the guys
[2:15:10.100 --> 2:15:11.620]  they're even more vicious than everybody.
[2:15:11.620 --> 2:15:13.660]  Yeah, in some sense, they have to prove themselves.
[2:15:13.660 --> 2:15:15.340]  You know, Cleopatra was there with Anthony
[2:15:15.340 --> 2:15:16.180]  at the Battle of Acts.
[2:15:16.180 --> 2:15:17.100]  Starting those wars.
[2:15:17.100 --> 2:15:17.940]  Yes.
[2:15:17.940 --> 2:15:18.780]  So-
[2:15:18.780 --> 2:15:20.660]  Right in checks, they can't cash.
[2:15:20.660 --> 2:15:21.500]  Yes.
[2:15:21.500 --> 2:15:23.100]  And we need to remember as well
[2:15:23.100 --> 2:15:25.060]  in terms of knowing that, Titanic,
[2:15:25.060 --> 2:15:29.460]  right now, Alex, we're carrying a $20 trillion national debt.
[2:15:29.460 --> 2:15:33.500]  That is at about a 1% historically,
[2:15:33.500 --> 2:15:35.180]  unusually low interest rate.
[2:15:35.180 --> 2:15:37.180]  If it went back to historical averages,
[2:15:37.180 --> 2:15:39.380]  like 3.5% on government securities,
[2:15:39.380 --> 2:15:42.980]  we would spend the entire budget on paying interest.
[2:15:42.980 --> 2:15:44.620]  We'd have no money for anything else.
[2:15:44.620 --> 2:15:45.940]  That's just going back to historical-
[2:15:45.940 --> 2:15:46.980]  Let's talk about the Titanic.
[2:15:46.980 --> 2:15:49.020]  The facts of numbers.
[2:15:49.020 --> 2:15:50.580]  Then what are the Democrats and Republicans
[2:15:50.580 --> 2:15:52.340]  still accelerating these budgets?
[2:15:52.340 --> 2:15:53.740]  What are they thinking?
[2:15:53.740 --> 2:15:56.420]  They're just pushing the day of reckoning off.
[2:15:56.420 --> 2:15:57.260]  They're in denial.
[2:15:57.260 --> 2:15:58.100]  They are in denial.
[2:15:58.100 --> 2:16:00.900]  And Alex, that's the way the Roman Empire fell.
[2:16:00.900 --> 2:16:01.740]  So did-
[2:16:01.740 --> 2:16:02.820]  Just pushed off and off.
[2:16:02.820 --> 2:16:03.860]  So it took a while.
[2:16:03.860 --> 2:16:06.820]  Finally, Alec, the great, sacked Rome in 410.
[2:16:06.820 --> 2:16:07.820]  But it took a while.
[2:16:07.820 --> 2:16:10.100]  And everyone said, sleep, be merry.
[2:16:10.100 --> 2:16:11.620]  Tomorrow, somebody else can die,
[2:16:11.620 --> 2:16:13.380]  but I won't be around, so I won't care.
[2:16:13.380 --> 2:16:15.420]  That is how irresponsible this is.
[2:16:15.420 --> 2:16:17.380]  And that's the only reason why
[2:16:17.380 --> 2:16:19.260]  you could have people with complacency,
[2:16:19.260 --> 2:16:22.620]  burdened posterity with $20 trillion in national debt
[2:16:22.620 --> 2:16:23.900]  and not bat an eye.
[2:16:23.900 --> 2:16:27.500]  George Washington said, in his farewell address,
[2:16:27.500 --> 2:16:30.580]  it is totally irresponsible and reprehensible
[2:16:30.580 --> 2:16:34.300]  for us not to pay back every single dollar that we borrowed
[2:16:34.300 --> 2:16:36.740]  so that posterity doesn't have to pay
[2:16:36.740 --> 2:16:38.540]  for our luxuries and confines.
[2:16:38.540 --> 2:16:40.700]  That was 227 years ago.
[2:16:40.700 --> 2:16:41.900]  Where is that voice?
[2:16:41.900 --> 2:16:43.140]  No one cares at all.
[2:16:43.140 --> 2:16:44.820]  Well, somebody else can pay it back.
[2:16:44.820 --> 2:16:46.620]  Well, I don't, I mean, I don't overuse this.
[2:16:46.620 --> 2:16:49.140]  It's just that I've been watching press conferences
[2:16:49.140 --> 2:16:50.260]  with the Democrats and I mean,
[2:16:50.260 --> 2:16:52.780]  there's something wrong, like that strokes or something.
[2:16:52.780 --> 2:16:54.300]  But I guess they're just so shell shocked
[2:16:54.300 --> 2:16:55.700]  by losing their power
[2:16:55.700 --> 2:16:57.700]  that they just act even more bizarre,
[2:16:57.700 --> 2:17:00.380]  like acting out like toddlers where they don't know.
[2:17:00.380 --> 2:17:02.260]  They think islands are floating.
[2:17:02.260 --> 2:17:03.980]  I mean, have you seen this?
[2:17:03.980 --> 2:17:06.780]  No, I've not seen floating islands out there.
[2:17:06.780 --> 2:17:10.620]  Yeah, like the Democrat from Atlanta thinks islands float.
[2:17:10.620 --> 2:17:14.460]  You didn't see Pelosi think that Pelosi thinks
[2:17:14.460 --> 2:17:17.820]  that Bush is still in office and Maxine Waters thinks
[2:17:17.820 --> 2:17:20.220]  that the, you know, he invaded Korea.
[2:17:20.220 --> 2:17:21.420]  I mean, it's, I'm telling you, man,
[2:17:21.420 --> 2:17:23.140]  you watched these press conferences.
[2:17:23.140 --> 2:17:25.060]  Well, I mean, it's like watching
[2:17:25.060 --> 2:17:28.420]  a five year old pretend they're an astronaut or something.
[2:17:28.420 --> 2:17:29.780]  Yeah, but I do think Alex,
[2:17:29.780 --> 2:17:32.140]  by giving them too much attention, you know,
[2:17:32.140 --> 2:17:35.220]  we overestimate, you know, I think their attraction.
[2:17:35.220 --> 2:17:37.740]  I don't see them having any game plan to recover.
[2:17:37.740 --> 2:17:40.060]  So you think MSM just puts out huge lies
[2:17:40.060 --> 2:17:42.180]  to just try to start a fight?
[2:17:42.180 --> 2:17:43.900]  Like they put out outrageous stuff
[2:17:43.900 --> 2:17:46.740]  just to get us in an argument to make themselves pertinent.
[2:17:46.740 --> 2:17:47.900]  I think that's correct.
[2:17:47.900 --> 2:17:50.140]  And we, and don't buy into that.
[2:17:50.140 --> 2:17:52.500]  Just ignore it and move on with your policies.
[2:17:52.500 --> 2:17:53.700]  Why are you trying to suggest
[2:17:53.700 --> 2:17:55.340]  that they're more powerful than the end?
[2:17:55.340 --> 2:17:56.980]  So you think it's true Trump responds
[2:17:56.980 --> 2:17:57.940]  too much to their attacks.
[2:17:57.940 --> 2:18:00.220]  He thinks he's beating them in those attacks.
[2:18:00.220 --> 2:18:01.260]  I mean, I think there's something to that,
[2:18:01.260 --> 2:18:04.020]  but I get also just ignoring them and moving forward.
[2:18:04.020 --> 2:18:06.140]  You can win the war and lose, I mean,
[2:18:06.140 --> 2:18:07.700]  win the battle and lose the war.
[2:18:07.700 --> 2:18:08.660]  Appear in victory?
[2:18:08.660 --> 2:18:10.900]  Yeah, because if he's not focused,
[2:18:10.900 --> 2:18:13.140]  I say on real personnel,
[2:18:13.140 --> 2:18:15.300]  those energies should be searching for people
[2:18:15.300 --> 2:18:16.740]  to get in the government agencies.
[2:18:16.740 --> 2:18:18.500]  That'll turn things around.
[2:18:18.500 --> 2:18:21.460]  You know, he's still distracted in his attention.
[2:18:21.460 --> 2:18:23.300]  He's got to have a sense of priorities.
[2:18:23.300 --> 2:18:24.140]  Get out of the war.
[2:18:24.140 --> 2:18:26.700]  And also, you think he's got to assume immigration order.
[2:18:26.700 --> 2:18:28.260]  I mean, you think you should get that through law,
[2:18:28.260 --> 2:18:29.100]  not just in order.
[2:18:29.100 --> 2:18:32.620]  Yeah, I think that the best way to do that procedurally,
[2:18:32.620 --> 2:18:34.540]  you know, if he wants it to stick,
[2:18:34.540 --> 2:18:35.740]  have it proposed as a bill,
[2:18:35.740 --> 2:18:38.460]  that one of the primary functions of Congress
[2:18:38.460 --> 2:18:40.060]  is to pass immigration statutes.
[2:18:40.060 --> 2:18:43.540]  In 2015, Congress did pass a statute that said,
[2:18:43.540 --> 2:18:46.660]  we don't, people who visited recently from Europe
[2:18:46.660 --> 2:18:48.420]  into Iraq and Syria,
[2:18:48.420 --> 2:18:50.580]  we need to have them come in and get vetted.
[2:18:50.580 --> 2:18:52.700]  We shouldn't have them visa free.
[2:18:52.700 --> 2:18:54.420]  And Congress enacted the statute.
[2:18:54.420 --> 2:18:56.740]  And the way in which you get things done
[2:18:56.740 --> 2:18:58.060]  and changed permanently,
[2:18:58.060 --> 2:18:59.220]  you oppose the bill,
[2:18:59.220 --> 2:19:01.180]  their hearings, the American people can see it.
[2:19:01.180 --> 2:19:02.300]  You present your evidence.
[2:19:02.300 --> 2:19:03.420]  This is why it needs to happen.
[2:19:03.420 --> 2:19:04.900]  Say, Congress, you are accountable.
[2:19:04.900 --> 2:19:06.500]  And then the American people can see,
[2:19:06.500 --> 2:19:07.340]  they can phone in.
[2:19:07.340 --> 2:19:08.180]  Because the key, I mean,
[2:19:08.180 --> 2:19:09.660]  the hard part of Congress was true.
[2:19:09.660 --> 2:19:11.540]  They give power to the presidency of bureaucracy,
[2:19:11.540 --> 2:19:13.340]  just lazily passing the buck.
[2:19:13.340 --> 2:19:14.980]  Yes, and then the buck is hidden,
[2:19:14.980 --> 2:19:16.780]  so American people don't know why
[2:19:16.780 --> 2:19:18.700]  it just comes out as an executive order.
[2:19:18.700 --> 2:19:20.460]  The American people need to be engaged.
[2:19:20.460 --> 2:19:21.940]  The reason why Watergate worked,
[2:19:21.940 --> 2:19:23.780]  because it was public, it was transparent.
[2:19:23.780 --> 2:19:25.460]  Now, when there's classified information,
[2:19:25.460 --> 2:19:26.580]  you can have executive session.
[2:19:26.580 --> 2:19:28.260]  Not everything needs to be public.
[2:19:28.260 --> 2:19:30.500]  But the presumption needs to be transparency.
[2:19:30.500 --> 2:19:32.860]  And then it's the American people's government.
[2:19:32.860 --> 2:19:33.900]  It should be in public.
[2:19:33.900 --> 2:19:34.860]  And they need to know,
[2:19:34.860 --> 2:19:36.300]  do I need to make a phone call?
[2:19:36.300 --> 2:19:37.460]  Do I need to write a letter?
[2:19:37.460 --> 2:19:38.300]  I'd like it.
[2:19:38.300 --> 2:19:39.140]  I don't like it.
[2:19:39.140 --> 2:19:40.460]  I would make these suggestions.
[2:19:40.460 --> 2:19:42.980]  The process itself is what makes us great.
[2:19:44.220 --> 2:19:46.220]  Bruce Fryan's our guest.
[2:19:46.220 --> 2:19:48.340]  We're gonna be coming back with a final segment
[2:19:48.340 --> 2:19:50.900]  to see other key points he'd like to talk about
[2:19:50.900 --> 2:19:52.700]  concerning what's happening in DC.
[2:19:52.700 --> 2:19:54.100]  But make no mistake,
[2:19:54.100 --> 2:19:56.700]  Donald Trump is a seismic earthquake
[2:19:56.700 --> 2:19:58.100]  to the globalist establishment.
[2:19:58.100 --> 2:19:58.940]  We'll be back.
[2:20:00.140 --> 2:20:01.220]  Many books have been written
[2:20:01.220 --> 2:20:03.020]  regarding the law of attraction.
[2:20:03.020 --> 2:20:04.660]  But what if all these books are missing
[2:20:04.660 --> 2:20:06.660]  the most important information we can use
[2:20:06.660 --> 2:20:09.500]  when it comes to activating this law in our lives?

[2:20:17.580 --> 2:20:19.860]  and how it is being suppressed in our lives.

[2:20:35.780 --> 2:20:38.060]  President Trump is really shaking up Washington
[2:20:38.060 --> 2:20:38.900]  and the media.

[2:22:04.900 --> 2:22:07.100]  and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns,
[2:22:07.100 --> 2:22:10.260]  blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[2:24:46.380 --> 2:24:47.420]  That's just some of the news.
[2:24:47.420 --> 2:24:50.780]  It's up on drugsreport.com.
[2:24:50.780 --> 2:24:52.820]  TSA warns, you know, I saw this last week.
[2:24:52.820 --> 2:24:54.580]  I hope that wasn't the case.
[2:24:54.580 --> 2:24:58.260]  TSA warns local police about new airport pat-down.
[2:24:58.260 --> 2:24:59.260]  Legalized groping.
[2:24:59.260 --> 2:25:01.220]  They're actually going to squeeze your genitals.
[2:25:01.220 --> 2:25:02.620]  Even if you go through the body scanner,
[2:25:02.620 --> 2:25:03.740]  but we've got to let the Muslims in
[2:25:03.740 --> 2:25:05.260]  to dispose of the cause of it.
[2:25:05.260 --> 2:25:06.100]  What a joke.
[2:25:06.100 --> 2:25:07.500]  You want to comment on that first?
[2:25:07.500 --> 2:25:09.340]  Fine, and then let's get into your other messages
[2:25:09.340 --> 2:25:11.020]  to Trump yet some more to say.
[2:25:11.020 --> 2:25:15.220]  Well, I think it shows the basic de facto elimination
[2:25:15.220 --> 2:25:16.500]  of the Fourth Amendment,
[2:25:16.500 --> 2:25:18.580]  just like other amendments to the Constitution.
[2:25:18.580 --> 2:25:20.660]  It's really quite disturbing.
[2:25:20.660 --> 2:25:21.660]  You know, we have Nancy Pelosi.
[2:25:21.660 --> 2:25:23.380]  It'll be a proctology exam.
[2:25:23.380 --> 2:25:24.220]  Well, not only...
[2:25:24.220 --> 2:25:25.060]  Gravity search.
[2:25:25.060 --> 2:25:27.940]  But if you can white out the Fourth Amendment,
[2:25:27.940 --> 2:25:29.140]  how about the Second Amendment?
[2:25:29.140 --> 2:25:30.340]  How about the First Amendment?
[2:25:30.340 --> 2:25:31.180]  Where do you stop?
[2:25:31.180 --> 2:25:32.460]  Private property, everything.
[2:25:32.460 --> 2:25:34.700]  Yeah, if you white out the treaty clause
[2:25:34.700 --> 2:25:35.540]  and you white out...
[2:25:35.540 --> 2:25:36.380]  And just get rid of America.
[2:25:36.380 --> 2:25:37.220]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:25:37.220 --> 2:25:38.060]  You just get rid of America.
[2:25:38.060 --> 2:25:39.500]  Because America was just more dirt,
[2:25:39.500 --> 2:25:41.540]  but it was about certain rules for the people.
[2:25:41.540 --> 2:25:42.900]  Yeah, about standards,
[2:25:42.900 --> 2:25:45.100]  about the fact that we need to limit government.
[2:25:45.100 --> 2:25:47.380]  We need to put government in chains.
[2:25:47.380 --> 2:25:49.780]  Well, how about you don't bring in radical Islam people
[2:25:49.780 --> 2:25:51.260]  who are 99% of the terror
[2:25:51.260 --> 2:25:53.340]  and then I don't have to get my genitals grabbed?
[2:25:53.340 --> 2:25:54.820]  Yeah, and moreover,
[2:25:54.820 --> 2:25:56.260]  how about not fighting the wars
[2:25:56.260 --> 2:25:58.500]  that are turning countries into wilderness
[2:25:58.500 --> 2:25:59.460]  so people are leaving?
[2:25:59.460 --> 2:26:00.540]  Yeah, if you bomb people,
[2:26:00.540 --> 2:26:03.060]  they don't have any houses to live in anymore.
[2:26:03.060 --> 2:26:04.780]  And that's what Ron Paul said.
[2:26:04.780 --> 2:26:06.500]  If you can march them in, you can march them out.
[2:26:06.500 --> 2:26:08.020]  But going to the larger point,
[2:26:08.020 --> 2:26:10.900]  I think even with regard to the immigration order
[2:26:10.900 --> 2:26:12.500]  that was new and issued today,
[2:26:12.500 --> 2:26:14.700]  I wonder who the White House might have suggested.
[2:26:14.700 --> 2:26:16.100]  Hey, Mr. President,
[2:26:16.100 --> 2:26:18.460]  how about making this piece of legislation
[2:26:18.460 --> 2:26:21.060]  like it's supposed to be done for 200 years?
[2:26:21.060 --> 2:26:22.700]  Not everything by executive order.
[2:26:22.700 --> 2:26:23.860]  You propose it to Congress.
[2:26:23.860 --> 2:26:25.660]  Then it puts the onus on them.
[2:26:25.660 --> 2:26:27.220]  It's the onus is on them.
[2:26:27.220 --> 2:26:28.820]  And then you can have the hearings,
[2:26:28.820 --> 2:26:30.060]  they vote for it as this.
[2:26:30.060 --> 2:26:31.940]  You're the one, I proposed it.
[2:26:31.940 --> 2:26:33.500]  You're the one who decides.
[2:26:33.500 --> 2:26:36.300]  You take accountability if it works or doesn't work.
[2:26:36.300 --> 2:26:37.980]  And the American people get along.
[2:26:37.980 --> 2:26:39.300]  We've so accustomed to the idea.
[2:26:39.300 --> 2:26:40.300]  And then it's transparent.
[2:26:40.300 --> 2:26:41.420]  And then the media can't lie
[2:26:41.420 --> 2:26:43.060]  about what his order really does.
[2:26:43.060 --> 2:26:45.340]  Right, and then the pros and cons are there
[2:26:45.340 --> 2:26:47.020]  and people can make up their own.
[2:26:47.020 --> 2:26:47.860]  Well, I think, you know,
[2:26:47.860 --> 2:26:49.900]  when the Congress tries to block him on Obamacare and stuff,
[2:26:49.900 --> 2:26:52.540]  he should force it to put it on them in a reelection.
[2:26:52.540 --> 2:26:54.580]  I get him sign executive order telling the IRS,
[2:26:54.580 --> 2:26:56.420]  don't take the $5,000.
[2:26:56.420 --> 2:26:58.420]  Then they say, okay, we won't, maybe we will.
[2:26:58.420 --> 2:26:59.780]  You know, he's trying,
[2:26:59.780 --> 2:27:01.700]  but we see this executive power
[2:27:01.700 --> 2:27:03.660]  is now even being bucked by the bureaucracy.
[2:27:03.660 --> 2:27:05.660]  So it's even worse than the out of control
[2:27:05.660 --> 2:27:07.300]  power of the president.
[2:27:07.300 --> 2:27:08.580]  Well, but that's where you create it.
[2:27:08.580 --> 2:27:10.460]  It's like the sources of apprentice, right?
[2:27:10.460 --> 2:27:12.660]  You create a limitless executive branch,
[2:27:12.660 --> 2:27:14.740]  then just out of your control as well.
[2:27:14.740 --> 2:27:16.260]  And that's why we need to go back
[2:27:16.260 --> 2:27:17.900]  to procedural, regular-
[2:27:17.900 --> 2:27:19.980]  We need laws, not sorcerers.
[2:27:19.980 --> 2:27:21.420]  Exactly, we need laws.
[2:27:21.420 --> 2:27:24.420]  And as you pointed out, go it to the Congress.
[2:27:24.420 --> 2:27:25.780]  They're responsible.
[2:27:25.780 --> 2:27:27.260]  It's got to be transparent.
[2:27:27.260 --> 2:27:28.700]  I mean, even like the idea
[2:27:28.700 --> 2:27:30.900]  that they're going to rewrite Obamacare in secret,
[2:27:30.900 --> 2:27:32.060]  they didn't want to hold-
[2:27:32.060 --> 2:27:33.140]  Rand Paul's really doing it,
[2:27:33.140 --> 2:27:35.300]  banging on the door saying, give me a copy.
[2:27:35.300 --> 2:27:36.500]  Why the hell is that secret?
[2:27:36.500 --> 2:27:38.620]  Why are the Republicans right in behind those doors?
[2:27:38.620 --> 2:27:40.300]  You know, classified information, you know,
[2:27:40.300 --> 2:27:41.340]  they're not talking about nuclear weapons.
[2:27:41.340 --> 2:27:43.700]  That's one good thing Trump did was he just killed TPPs.
[2:27:43.700 --> 2:27:44.940]  It's not my authority.
[2:27:44.940 --> 2:27:46.900]  Back to Congress, it was never there.
[2:27:46.900 --> 2:27:48.660]  I mean, now he ought to do the same thing on Obamacare.
[2:27:48.660 --> 2:27:49.500]  He must say to the Republicans,
[2:27:49.500 --> 2:27:51.500]  what are you doing behind those doors?
[2:27:51.500 --> 2:27:55.100]  Absolutely, and there ought to be a clamor.
[2:27:55.100 --> 2:27:57.900]  There ought to be a bill that Trump should propose.
[2:27:57.900 --> 2:28:00.860]  It says you can't hold Congressional sessions in secret
[2:28:00.860 --> 2:28:04.180]  unless you testify that there's a national security purpose.
[2:28:04.180 --> 2:28:06.500]  That is what makes the United States different.
[2:28:06.500 --> 2:28:07.420]  It's transparent.
[2:28:07.420 --> 2:28:09.460]  The reason is, how can you have government
[2:28:09.460 --> 2:28:10.900]  by the consent of the government?
[2:28:10.900 --> 2:28:11.820]  Give it some secret.
[2:28:11.820 --> 2:28:14.340]  Yeah, and they don't know what's going on.
[2:28:14.340 --> 2:28:15.700]  Well, I mean, I'll give Trump this.
[2:28:15.700 --> 2:28:16.740]  He did kill TPP.
[2:28:16.740 --> 2:28:17.580]  He's done a lot of good things.
[2:28:17.580 --> 2:28:18.700]  That's why the elites are mad at him.
[2:28:18.700 --> 2:28:20.180]  We're not here criticizing him.
[2:28:20.180 --> 2:28:21.180]  We're trying to give him better advice.
[2:28:21.180 --> 2:28:22.180]  I mean, just imagine, like you said,
[2:28:22.180 --> 2:28:23.620]  Hillary would have been hitting the iceberg.
[2:28:23.620 --> 2:28:25.780]  Yes, and that's what I want to underscore.
[2:28:25.780 --> 2:28:28.260]  Alex, this is not to give people report cards.
[2:28:28.260 --> 2:28:31.340]  We're all, you know, we're frail creatures.
[2:28:31.340 --> 2:28:33.140]  It's, we want to move forward together.
[2:28:33.140 --> 2:28:34.300]  We hang together.
[2:28:34.300 --> 2:28:35.380]  It's not fault-finding.
[2:28:35.380 --> 2:28:36.220]  It's what we do better.
[2:28:36.220 --> 2:28:37.900]  And hey, you've gotten a ton of stuff done in DC.
[2:28:37.900 --> 2:28:39.540]  I mean, on your record, I mean,
[2:28:39.540 --> 2:28:41.980]  your whole pedigree against stuff done for the people
[2:28:41.980 --> 2:28:42.940]  has really paid off.
[2:28:42.940 --> 2:28:44.100]  This show, it probably exists
[2:28:44.100 --> 2:28:45.940]  because you've been rid of the fairness doctrine.
[2:28:45.940 --> 2:28:46.780]  So good job.
[2:28:46.780 --> 2:28:48.500]  And so I think Trump and the rest of the folks
[2:28:48.500 --> 2:28:49.500]  and the people should hear this
[2:28:49.500 --> 2:28:50.660]  and we should have a debate.
[2:28:50.660 --> 2:28:52.100]  We don't dumb the news down, folks.
[2:28:52.100 --> 2:28:53.620]  We have big, complex discussions here
[2:28:53.620 --> 2:28:56.060]  because, frankly, we're just looking for the thinkers out there
[2:28:56.060 --> 2:28:57.620]  that want to change the world.
[2:28:57.620 --> 2:29:01.580]  And I just want to say a special tribute to Ron Paul.
[2:29:01.580 --> 2:29:03.660]  Ron Paul put these items on the agenda
[2:29:03.660 --> 2:29:04.500]  when he was out in the wilderness.
[2:29:04.500 --> 2:29:05.340]  He helped, we all helped,
[2:29:05.340 --> 2:29:06.980]  supporting him set the foundation.
[2:29:06.980 --> 2:29:09.700]  Yes, and he's the inspiration behind this.
[2:29:09.700 --> 2:29:11.340]  And when he got no kudos,
[2:29:11.340 --> 2:29:13.580]  when he was said he's eccentric and whatever,
[2:29:13.580 --> 2:29:15.900]  he was not on talk shows or anything.
[2:29:15.900 --> 2:29:18.220]  So we need to remember it was people like him
[2:29:18.220 --> 2:29:19.820]  who created the American Revolution.
[2:29:19.820 --> 2:29:20.660]  They're the trailblazers.
[2:29:20.660 --> 2:29:22.700]  They found the past that we're now building roads on.
[2:29:22.700 --> 2:29:25.340]  And didn't need to get all the glory and all the money.
[2:29:25.340 --> 2:29:27.740]  And let's remember, it's not going to be,
[2:29:27.740 --> 2:29:29.700]  the Republic won't be rebuilt today.
[2:29:29.700 --> 2:29:31.300]  We're in, I think we've got the momentum though.
[2:29:31.300 --> 2:29:32.980]  I think good things are happening.
[2:29:32.980 --> 2:29:36.340]  You can find his latest book, Constitution in Peril,
[2:29:36.340 --> 2:29:37.180]  The Life and Death,
[2:29:37.180 --> 2:29:38.620]  Struggle for a Constitution and Democracy,
[2:29:38.620 --> 2:29:41.620]  American Empire for the Fall at Amazon and other places.
[2:29:41.620 --> 2:29:42.460]  Bruce, fine.
[2:29:42.460 --> 2:29:43.740]  Thanks for coming down to Austin, Texas.
[2:29:43.740 --> 2:29:44.580]  Great meeting with you.
[2:29:44.580 --> 2:29:45.420]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:29:45.420 --> 2:29:46.900]  Maybe we'll have you reporting for us, son.
[2:29:46.900 --> 2:29:47.860]  Yeah, I hope so.
[2:29:47.860 --> 2:29:49.300]  Yeah, we're working a lot of stuff.
[2:29:49.300 --> 2:29:53.140]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[2:29:53.140 --> 2:29:56.100]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.020 --> 2:30:01.620]  The TSA is not satisfied
[2:30:01.620 --> 2:30:03.260]  with their current pat-down procedure.
[2:30:03.260 --> 2:30:05.660]  So they are ramping them up to get more invasive.
[2:30:05.660 --> 2:30:07.180]  This is in response to a study
[2:30:07.180 --> 2:30:09.540]  that found weapons making it past security.
[2:30:09.540 --> 2:30:12.380]  The new pat-down will be quote, more intimate
[2:30:12.380 --> 2:30:13.220]  than before.
[2:30:13.220 --> 2:30:15.380]  While TSA screenings are clearly fallible,
[2:30:15.380 --> 2:30:17.220]  this new loving pat-down procedure
[2:30:17.220 --> 2:30:18.740]  will make it less appealing for people
[2:30:18.740 --> 2:30:20.780]  who want to bypass the radiation scanners
[2:30:20.780 --> 2:30:21.820]  for health concerns.
[2:30:21.820 --> 2:30:24.260]  So they will just capitulate to the body scanners,
[2:30:24.260 --> 2:30:25.700]  which I'm sure will be ramped up
[2:30:25.700 --> 2:30:27.380]  and more intimate soon as well.
[2:30:27.380 --> 2:30:30.140]  Keep in mind, this applies to the random pat-down.
[2:30:30.140 --> 2:30:33.140]  So this loose net is hardly an effective strategy,
[2:30:33.140 --> 2:30:35.860]  unless you're looking to give more TSA agents freedom
[2:30:35.860 --> 2:30:37.340]  to grope your wife's chest.
[2:30:37.340 --> 2:30:39.300]  For the first time in human history,
[2:30:39.300 --> 2:30:42.060]  CNN's Angela Rye is right about something.
[2:30:42.060 --> 2:30:44.620]  As she wrote a piece titled, Dear TSA,
[2:30:44.620 --> 2:30:47.420]  the country is not safer after you grab vaginas,
[2:30:47.420 --> 2:30:49.580]  after an experience she had with the TSA.
[2:30:49.580 --> 2:30:51.540]  And that was before the new policy.
[2:30:51.540 --> 2:30:55.340]  Let's all unite behind molestation-free air travel for all.
[2:30:55.340 --> 2:30:56.900]  Make flying great again.
[2:30:56.900 --> 2:30:59.660]  This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com.

[2:31:59.780 --> 2:32:01.580]  Today we call it bone broth,
[2:32:01.580 --> 2:32:02.860]  and for thousands of years,
[2:32:02.860 --> 2:32:04.980]  our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[2:32:04.980 --> 2:32:08.220]  before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[2:32:08.220 --> 2:32:11.380]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com,
[2:32:11.380 --> 2:32:13.420]  the ultimate and true paleo nutrition
[2:32:13.420 --> 2:32:16.580]  with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom,

[2:32:18.820 --> 2:32:21.940]  in a single great tasting formula, Caveman.
[2:32:21.940 --> 2:32:23.580]  It's those people living in the wilds
[2:32:23.580 --> 2:32:25.340]  having to actually build civilization
[2:32:25.340 --> 2:32:27.060]  that are our superior ancestors,
[2:32:27.060 --> 2:32:29.380]  and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[2:32:29.380 --> 2:32:32.620]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[2:32:32.620 --> 2:32:34.900]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking,
[2:32:34.900 --> 2:32:37.780]  but you used the bones for strength
[2:32:37.780 --> 2:32:40.980]  from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors
[2:32:40.980 --> 2:32:43.100]  to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[2:32:43.100 --> 2:32:45.860]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[2:32:45.860 --> 2:32:48.780]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were,
[2:32:48.780 --> 2:32:51.300]  but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence
[2:32:51.300 --> 2:32:53.820]  that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[2:32:53.820 --> 2:32:55.540]  I know you're gonna wanna check out Caveman,
[2:32:55.540 --> 2:32:57.340]  ultimate paleo formula for yourself

[2:32:58.740 --> 2:33:08.740]  ["Waging War on Corruption"]
[2:33:08.740 --> 2:33:13.260]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones
[2:33:13.260 --> 2:33:17.060]  coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[2:33:22.060 --> 2:33:24.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up,
[2:33:24.900 --> 2:33:27.540]  Chris Ruddy, the CEO and founder of Newsmax,
[2:33:27.540 --> 2:33:30.500]  quote, I spoke to the president about a wiretap story
[2:33:30.500 --> 2:33:32.300]  that was in Mar-Lago yesterday.
[2:33:32.300 --> 2:33:34.980]  I haven't seen this pissed off in a long time.
[2:33:36.380 --> 2:33:38.220]  Absolutely, and they got photos of him
[2:33:38.220 --> 2:33:40.540]  in the New Yorker magazine coming out,
[2:33:40.540 --> 2:33:43.420]  and he's also said this, that when they said,
[2:33:43.420 --> 2:33:45.820]  sessions recused himself, he just blew up and said,
[2:33:45.820 --> 2:33:47.300]  who told him that?
[2:33:47.300 --> 2:33:49.060]  Word is, it was little previous.
[2:33:51.580 --> 2:33:52.940]  So why recuse yourself?
[2:33:52.940 --> 2:33:54.580]  Why, why, why?
[2:33:54.580 --> 2:33:56.900]  Why were you doing anything wrong?
[2:33:56.900 --> 2:33:59.980]  So that's all coming up.
[2:33:59.980 --> 2:34:02.980]  Not a perfect president, but not out to get us.
[2:34:02.980 --> 2:34:05.580]  I'm actually trying to help the people.
[2:34:05.580 --> 2:34:07.180]  I wanna use this story out of Bloomberg.
[2:34:07.180 --> 2:34:09.340]  I mean, you just read this thing and it's so creepy.
[2:34:09.340 --> 2:34:10.940]  And you know, here's the deal.
[2:34:12.220 --> 2:34:13.620]  I was one of the biggest enemies
[2:34:13.620 --> 2:34:15.820]  of the quote TSA over the years,
[2:34:16.700 --> 2:34:19.580]  but I realized that they're just people with jobs.
[2:34:19.580 --> 2:34:22.740]  Most of them think they're fighting radical Islam.
[2:34:22.740 --> 2:34:24.140]  Why do we leave our borders open
[2:34:24.140 --> 2:34:25.740]  and bring jihadis in unvetted
[2:34:25.740 --> 2:34:28.060]  when 99% of the terrorism is Islamic
[2:34:28.060 --> 2:34:30.220]  and then make everybody induct themselves
[2:34:30.220 --> 2:34:31.500]  through the slave training,
[2:34:32.700 --> 2:34:34.940]  which just trains everybody,
[2:34:34.940 --> 2:34:37.020]  as even psychologists say, to have pedophiles
[2:34:37.020 --> 2:34:38.100]  feed on their kids.
[2:34:39.100 --> 2:34:42.580]  And now they say, they're gonna still grow up your genitals,
[2:34:42.580 --> 2:34:43.940]  but now without you asking,
[2:34:43.940 --> 2:34:45.940]  you're gonna be taken to a private room.
[2:34:46.980 --> 2:34:49.500]  And strip search, good God.
[2:34:51.140 --> 2:34:52.380]  Can't we just fly?
[2:34:52.380 --> 2:34:54.140]  Can't you just leave us alone?
[2:34:54.140 --> 2:34:56.500]  I mean, this is so sick.
[2:34:56.500 --> 2:34:57.620]  These are internal checkpoints.
[2:34:57.620 --> 2:35:00.660]  They wanted the TSA to be a domestic security force
[2:35:00.660 --> 2:35:01.620]  under Obama.
[2:35:02.580 --> 2:35:05.060]  Bush started it all, but they admitted all that.
[2:35:05.060 --> 2:35:06.140]  They want them on the highway.
[2:35:06.140 --> 2:35:08.140]  It's like they are in many areas.
[2:35:08.140 --> 2:35:09.660]  You can argue, well, we're keeping you safe.
[2:35:09.660 --> 2:35:12.340]  Then control the borders first and who comes in?
[2:35:13.580 --> 2:35:15.380]  It didn't like you're looking for a particular person.
[2:35:15.380 --> 2:35:16.580]  Like if there was a bank robber
[2:35:16.580 --> 2:35:17.980]  that ran to a train station,
[2:35:17.980 --> 2:35:19.500]  shut the trains down, search people.
[2:35:19.500 --> 2:35:21.220]  You've got a clear and present danger.
[2:35:21.220 --> 2:35:26.220]  You've got probable cause, but you can't just randomly
[2:35:27.500 --> 2:35:30.740]  set checkpoints up and say, we're gonna search people.
[2:35:30.740 --> 2:35:31.980]  And of course it's about a power grab
[2:35:31.980 --> 2:35:33.780]  to get their hands on your person.
[2:35:33.780 --> 2:35:35.500]  I don't blame the individual TSA person,
[2:35:35.500 --> 2:35:37.020]  though some have been convicted as pedophiles
[2:35:37.020 --> 2:35:38.020]  and stealing stuff.
[2:35:38.020 --> 2:35:39.540]  That's just the regular population.
[2:35:39.540 --> 2:35:40.460]  That's gonna happen.
[2:35:40.460 --> 2:35:42.100]  I blame us for letting Congress do this.
[2:35:42.100 --> 2:35:43.380]  That's why I finally realized,
[2:35:43.380 --> 2:35:45.100]  why am I attacking TSA all day
[2:35:46.060 --> 2:35:48.220]  when they're not the ones that are actually doing all this?
[2:35:48.220 --> 2:35:49.620]  I mean, I don't care if they're searching your bags
[2:35:49.620 --> 2:35:52.100]  or checking stuff, going on airplane, whatever.
[2:35:52.100 --> 2:35:55.260]  Just don't sit there and put us through naked body standards.
[2:35:55.260 --> 2:35:56.100]  And that's not enough.
[2:35:56.100 --> 2:35:59.860]  Oh, secondary, we're gonna take you to a screening area
[2:35:59.860 --> 2:36:01.980]  and take your fricking clothes off.
[2:36:03.420 --> 2:36:04.860]  They had that happen four or five years ago.
[2:36:04.860 --> 2:36:06.980]  Remember folks would fight back, they'd kill them.
[2:36:06.980 --> 2:36:08.900]  They'd call the cops in, people die.
[2:36:10.620 --> 2:36:13.020]  God almighty, this is slave training.
[2:36:13.020 --> 2:36:15.340]  Trump isn't involved in this.
[2:36:15.340 --> 2:36:17.780]  I know for a fact, Trump didn't like all the TSA crap.
[2:36:17.780 --> 2:36:20.260]  He says, keep the Islamist out.
[2:36:21.620 --> 2:36:22.860]  But you read this thing,
[2:36:22.860 --> 2:36:25.180]  a universal comprehensive search
[2:36:25.180 --> 2:36:27.620]  may prompt passenger complaints to law enforcement.
[2:36:29.020 --> 2:36:31.100]  The US Transportation Security Administration
[2:36:31.100 --> 2:36:33.740]  has declined to sit exactly where and how employees
[2:36:33.740 --> 2:36:34.980]  will be touching air travelers
[2:36:34.980 --> 2:36:38.020]  as part of the more invasive physical bad down procedure
[2:36:38.020 --> 2:36:39.140]  it recently ordered.
[2:36:40.020 --> 2:36:40.940]  Who ordered that?
[2:36:40.940 --> 2:36:42.260]  The head of the agency.
[2:36:42.260 --> 2:36:44.620]  But the agency does expect some pastors
[2:36:44.620 --> 2:36:46.540]  to consider the examination unusual.
[2:36:46.540 --> 2:36:50.260]  In fact, the TSA decided to inform local police
[2:36:50.260 --> 2:36:53.820]  in case anyone calls report an abnormal federal frisking.
[2:36:54.940 --> 2:36:56.340]  If they get this will be like,
[2:36:56.340 --> 2:36:59.940]  now we're gonna insert our genitalia in your rectum
[2:36:59.940 --> 2:37:03.460]  because there might be a monster in there.
[2:37:03.460 --> 2:37:04.300]  I mean, I'm serious.
[2:37:04.300 --> 2:37:05.900]  This is just the sky's the limit.
[2:37:08.300 --> 2:37:10.780]  According to a memo from an Airport Trade Association
[2:37:10.780 --> 2:37:11.940]  obtained by Bloomberg,
[2:37:11.940 --> 2:37:14.380]  the physical search for those selected to have one
[2:37:14.380 --> 2:37:17.900]  is the agency described as a more comprehensive screening
[2:37:17.900 --> 2:37:19.900]  replacing five separate kinds of pat downs
[2:37:19.900 --> 2:37:23.220]  that previously used strip search poison girls.
[2:37:23.220 --> 2:37:25.500]  The decision to alert local airport police
[2:37:25.500 --> 2:37:27.540]  to raise the question of just how intimate
[2:37:27.540 --> 2:37:28.580]  because they're gonna be subscribing to the yellow
[2:37:28.580 --> 2:37:30.020]  they're gonna be tied down.
[2:37:30.020 --> 2:37:30.860]  The agency, oh yeah,
[2:37:30.860 --> 2:37:32.300]  just when they tell a woman your breasts look good.
[2:37:32.300 --> 2:37:33.460]  Let's pull those out.
[2:37:33.460 --> 2:37:35.340]  The decision to alert, that's happened before.
[2:37:35.340 --> 2:37:38.100]  Airport police raises a question of how intimate
[2:37:38.100 --> 2:37:39.780]  the agency's employees may get.
[2:37:39.780 --> 2:37:42.060]  On its website, the TSA says employees use the back
[2:37:42.060 --> 2:37:43.620]  of the hands for pat downs
[2:37:43.620 --> 2:37:45.580]  over sensitive areas of the body, like your genitals,
[2:37:45.580 --> 2:37:49.060]  breast, in limited cases, additional screening involves,
[2:37:49.060 --> 2:37:53.740]  here's the big one, a sensitive pat down
[2:37:53.740 --> 2:37:55.980]  with the front of the hands may be needed to determine
[2:37:55.980 --> 2:38:00.980]  the threat does not exist in private areas.
[2:38:02.580 --> 2:38:04.260]  They said they'll be taken to private areas
[2:38:04.260 --> 2:38:05.460]  where prior screening methods
[2:38:05.460 --> 2:38:07.060]  indicates the presence of explosives.
[2:38:07.060 --> 2:38:09.300]  Yeah, that goes on and on.
[2:38:09.300 --> 2:38:13.500]  So we got Chris Reddy coming on here in just a few minutes.
[2:38:13.500 --> 2:38:14.740]  I've not plugged one time today
[2:38:14.740 --> 2:38:17.860]  because I get so focused on defeating the globalist
[2:38:17.860 --> 2:38:21.140]  that I don't think, hey, we have to find this operation.
[2:38:24.020 --> 2:38:25.660]  We have a lot of great products.
[2:38:25.660 --> 2:38:27.260]  We're almost sold out of the limited edition.
[2:38:27.260 --> 2:38:32.260]  Donald Trump lowers, M4s, the 1776 reborn, President 45.
[2:38:34.500 --> 2:38:35.660]  We're about to sell out of X2.
[2:38:35.660 --> 2:38:36.740]  We're about to sell out of Rainforest.
[2:38:36.740 --> 2:38:38.340]  We're about to sell out of Secret 12.
[2:38:38.340 --> 2:38:40.020]  We're about to sell out of SuperMail Vitality.
[2:38:40.020 --> 2:38:42.020]  We're about to sell out of Colonial Silver.
[2:38:42.020 --> 2:38:43.780]  A lot of stuff is about to sell out,
[2:38:43.780 --> 2:38:45.620]  maybe months with some of them until we get more.
[2:38:45.620 --> 2:38:47.140]  Just, these are great products.
[2:38:47.140 --> 2:38:48.380]  Try them for yourself and know your support
[2:38:48.380 --> 2:38:49.220]  in the broadcast.
[2:38:49.220 --> 2:38:51.580]  I wanna thank you all for your support.
[2:38:51.580 --> 2:38:53.140]  Also, I have a dream
[2:38:53.140 --> 2:38:55.380]  and I've seen our dreams manifested together.
[2:38:57.620 --> 2:39:00.820]  But we're putting out the Trump Pins 2020 shirt
[2:39:00.820 --> 2:39:02.380]  because the president's never been under more attack.
[2:39:02.380 --> 2:39:04.860]  He's not, nobody's proven with himself in modern history
[2:39:04.860 --> 2:39:06.980]  to be such Americana as this.
[2:39:06.980 --> 2:39:09.700]  So we have the Trump Pins 2020 battle cry shirt
[2:39:09.700 --> 2:39:11.900]  keeping America red on the front, on the back,
[2:39:11.900 --> 2:39:16.540]  America first in 1776, 9.95.
[2:39:16.540 --> 2:39:17.900]  So we make like four or five bucks on these
[2:39:17.900 --> 2:39:18.820]  to fund the operation.
[2:39:18.820 --> 2:39:21.820]  But I just want everybody to get these into wear these
[2:39:21.820 --> 2:39:24.180]  and to show these to their friends and family.
[2:39:24.180 --> 2:39:28.020]  And to just exercise the open defeat of bullies
[2:39:28.020 --> 2:39:29.580]  and the open defeat of peer pressure.
[2:39:29.580 --> 2:39:31.420]  We can get past the peer pressure.
[2:39:31.420 --> 2:39:32.980]  Everything else flows from that.
[2:39:32.980 --> 2:39:35.220]  You're gonna find unless you go to some Berkeley event
[2:39:35.220 --> 2:39:36.940]  where you get beat up,
[2:39:36.940 --> 2:39:39.620]  especially if you're a woman, they're cowards.
[2:39:39.620 --> 2:39:40.900]  You're just gonna meet like-minded people
[2:39:40.900 --> 2:39:42.620]  that are in this Trump Pins 2020 shirt.
[2:39:42.620 --> 2:39:45.780]  But regardless, buy a few, give one to your husband,
[2:39:45.780 --> 2:39:46.900]  one to your wife, one to your son,
[2:39:46.900 --> 2:39:48.380]  one to your daughter, one to your coworkers,
[2:39:48.380 --> 2:39:49.220]  one to your boss.
[2:39:50.540 --> 2:39:51.580]  You know, people that are Trump supporters,
[2:39:51.580 --> 2:39:53.820]  get them a shirt, support the broadcast,
[2:39:53.820 --> 2:39:55.940]  get a great shirt, promote free speech,
[2:39:55.940 --> 2:39:57.700]  and just get out there on the ground
[2:39:57.700 --> 2:39:59.140]  because the enemy is funding,
[2:39:59.140 --> 2:40:01.220]  George Charles is funding all these demonstrations,
[2:40:01.220 --> 2:40:03.940]  all these riots, all this astroturf garbage.
[2:40:04.900 --> 2:40:06.180]  We're not fun about Soros.
[2:40:06.180 --> 2:40:08.540]  We're fine about you supporting the broadcast,
[2:40:08.540 --> 2:40:09.380]  you getting the products,
[2:40:09.380 --> 2:40:11.380]  you getting them out to everybody you know.
[2:40:11.380 --> 2:40:14.700]  So take action today, be part of history.
[2:40:14.700 --> 2:40:16.860]  Or listen, go make your own shirt on a third party site,
[2:40:16.860 --> 2:40:18.580]  take a lot of sites so you can make your t-shirt
[2:40:18.580 --> 2:40:21.140]  with your own design for like 15 bucks or whatever.
[2:40:21.140 --> 2:40:23.260]  Be your own Trump Pins 2020 with your own message.
[2:40:23.260 --> 2:40:27.420]  Just be involved, be engaged.
[2:40:27.420 --> 2:40:29.020]  If you're a veteran or an active duty,
[2:40:29.020 --> 2:40:29.860]  just hold up a sign saying,
[2:40:29.860 --> 2:40:32.260]  I support the commander-in-chief Donald Trump.
[2:40:33.260 --> 2:40:34.380]  You're absolutely,
[2:40:34.380 --> 2:40:36.820]  you're absolutely authorized to do that under the law,
[2:40:36.820 --> 2:40:39.660]  you're supposed to, if you're in the military anyways.
[2:40:39.660 --> 2:40:40.980]  So what are they gonna say to you?
[2:40:40.980 --> 2:40:42.060]  They're probably court-martialed,
[2:40:42.060 --> 2:40:43.740]  you're probably got Obama people in there
[2:40:43.740 --> 2:40:45.100]  and the president will veto that.
[2:40:45.100 --> 2:40:49.780]  I mean, we have to have good people put themselves
[2:40:49.780 --> 2:40:52.220]  in harm's way politically or through peer pressure,
[2:40:52.220 --> 2:40:53.660]  whatever, to save the country.
[2:40:53.660 --> 2:40:56.820]  They're out there trying to bully everyone
[2:40:56.820 --> 2:41:04.660]  into submission, we have to say no.
[2:41:04.660 --> 2:41:07.780]  So again, Trump Pins 2020 Battle Shirt,
[2:41:07.780 --> 2:41:10.260]  get it today in FullWarStore.com
[2:41:10.260 --> 2:41:13.220]  or AAA-253-3139.
[2:41:13.220 --> 2:41:14.580]  And I wanna thank you all for your support
[2:41:14.580 --> 2:41:15.540]  and what you're doing.
[2:41:15.540 --> 2:41:16.900]  Well, I saw the headline today,
[2:41:16.900 --> 2:41:19.300]  it was in a bunch of different newspapers,
[2:41:19.300 --> 2:41:21.940]  of course, Newsmax.com as well.
[2:41:21.940 --> 2:41:25.220]  Chris Reddy, the founder and CEO of Newsmax,
[2:41:25.220 --> 2:41:27.660]  who has a membership for many years
[2:41:27.660 --> 2:41:30.500]  at Mar-Lago Golf Club and Country Club there,
[2:41:30.500 --> 2:41:33.900]  where Donald Trump lives and owns part of the year.
[2:41:33.900 --> 2:41:35.620]  I remember seeing on Friday that Trump got angry
[2:41:35.620 --> 2:41:37.420]  and ran down there because he's like,
[2:41:37.420 --> 2:41:41.140]  why is Sessions recusing himself?
[2:41:41.140 --> 2:41:44.300]  And what's going on with these wiretaps?
[2:41:44.300 --> 2:41:46.180]  So Newsmax CEO of the Hill reports,
[2:41:46.180 --> 2:41:49.140]  Trump vows he'll be proven right on wiretaps.
[2:41:49.140 --> 2:41:50.780]  I mean, I've got an issue here.
[2:41:50.780 --> 2:41:53.100]  I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I'm not dumb.
[2:41:53.100 --> 2:41:55.500]  I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I'm not dumb.
[2:41:55.500 --> 2:41:57.940]  They bragged in hundreds of articles a day a month ago
[2:41:57.940 --> 2:42:00.700]  that they were surveilling Trump Tower, Flynn,
[2:42:00.700 --> 2:42:03.100]  and had these transcripts that now
[2:42:03.100 --> 2:42:08.100]  the intelligence committee had has reported,
[2:42:09.540 --> 2:42:10.860]  there's nothing there.
[2:42:10.860 --> 2:42:14.020]  So now they say, oh, we weren't recording you, you're insane.
[2:42:14.020 --> 2:42:16.940]  So Chris Reddy had a chance to talk to the president
[2:42:16.940 --> 2:42:18.940]  who's been friends with for many years,
[2:42:18.940 --> 2:42:20.620]  since it was just a real estate mogul.
[2:42:20.620 --> 2:42:22.540]  And he can tell us exactly what happened.
[2:42:22.540 --> 2:42:23.740]  Thank you for joining us.
[2:42:24.940 --> 2:42:26.260]  Alex, great to be on with you.
[2:42:26.260 --> 2:42:27.980]  Thank you for having me on.
[2:42:27.980 --> 2:42:30.380]  Love the work over at Newsmax, follow it every day.
[2:42:30.380 --> 2:42:32.700]  Wow, so tell us, I mean, it was in the news, he was mad,
[2:42:32.700 --> 2:42:35.940]  but Chris saw the videos of Bannon yelling at people.
[2:42:35.940 --> 2:42:37.140]  What's really going on?
[2:42:38.420 --> 2:42:41.300]  Well, I can't tell you that I know everything that's going
[2:42:41.300 --> 2:42:44.140]  on, I did meet the president twice on Saturday.
[2:42:44.140 --> 2:42:47.060]  I saw him during the lunch hour and then at dinner time.
[2:42:47.060 --> 2:42:50.380]  And you've met him, you can tell when he's happy.
[2:42:50.380 --> 2:42:52.820]  And I think you can probably pick up when he's not happy.
[2:42:52.820 --> 2:42:54.740]  And he didn't seem very happy.
[2:42:54.740 --> 2:42:59.100]  He seemed to be a little angry about what had happened.
[2:42:59.100 --> 2:43:01.820]  And he had tweeted out that morning
[2:43:01.820 --> 2:43:06.140]  that Obama had wiretapped him and surveilled his campaign
[2:43:06.140 --> 2:43:07.700]  at Trump Towers.
[2:43:07.700 --> 2:43:10.540]  And he repeated to me, he said he knew details
[2:43:10.540 --> 2:43:12.620]  of the process of what happened.
[2:43:12.620 --> 2:43:14.460]  He thought it was outrageous.
[2:43:14.460 --> 2:43:16.820]  It was watergate level stuff.
[2:43:16.820 --> 2:43:18.940]  It was McCarthyism.
[2:43:18.940 --> 2:43:21.780]  And he wanted to make sure that we were covering the press
[2:43:21.780 --> 2:43:22.780]  was covering it.
[2:43:22.780 --> 2:43:24.660]  Because remember, he just got off the golf course
[2:43:24.660 --> 2:43:27.220]  and I said, of course, everybody's talking about it.
[2:43:27.220 --> 2:43:29.340]  And he was not happy.
[2:43:29.340 --> 2:43:34.340]  And I think it, you know, Obama, I have talked to a lot
[2:43:34.340 --> 2:43:35.820]  of people in that Trump campaign.
[2:43:35.820 --> 2:43:38.540]  And I think there's about 100% consensus
[2:43:38.540 --> 2:43:40.780]  that people that worked on that campaign,
[2:43:40.780 --> 2:43:44.140]  especially the leadership, that they were surveilled
[2:43:44.140 --> 2:43:47.260]  by federal authorities at one point or another.
[2:43:47.260 --> 2:43:50.380]  And I don't know how that all worked.
[2:43:50.380 --> 2:43:51.820]  I don't know if it's true or not.
[2:43:51.820 --> 2:43:53.460]  I'm just telling you as a reporter,
[2:43:53.460 --> 2:43:57.100]  and that's what I was reporting on Newsmax and my blog,
[2:43:57.100 --> 2:43:58.860]  the facts on that.
[2:43:58.860 --> 2:44:01.180]  Well, I mean, I've rarely seen him angry.
[2:44:01.180 --> 2:44:02.860]  I mean, there's photos of him coming out of the White House
[2:44:02.860 --> 2:44:03.900]  after the argument.
[2:44:03.900 --> 2:44:05.460]  He looks really pissed off.
[2:44:05.460 --> 2:44:08.220]  We're seeing the angry Donald Trump here.
[2:44:08.220 --> 2:44:09.180]  And I agree with him.
[2:44:09.180 --> 2:44:13.620]  I mean, the attorney general met as one of the heads
[2:44:13.620 --> 2:44:15.940]  of the Armed Services Committee with a Russian twice.
[2:44:15.940 --> 2:44:17.620]  Everybody did that, Pelosi did.
[2:44:17.620 --> 2:44:18.460]  It's on record.
[2:44:18.460 --> 2:44:20.980]  They asked me to be involved in the campaign as a surrogate
[2:44:20.980 --> 2:44:21.980]  if they talked about the campaign.
[2:44:21.980 --> 2:44:23.020]  He said, no.
[2:44:23.020 --> 2:44:25.460]  So why the hell would he recuse himself?
[2:44:25.460 --> 2:44:27.940]  So let's just peel this onion, Alex,
[2:44:27.940 --> 2:44:30.220]  with your audience, okay?
[2:44:30.220 --> 2:44:32.420]  James Clapper, who was Obama's chief
[2:44:32.420 --> 2:44:34.100]  of national intelligence, was just
[2:44:34.100 --> 2:44:35.860]  on Meet the Press yesterday.
[2:44:35.860 --> 2:44:37.940]  He said they did a massive investigation.
[2:44:37.940 --> 2:44:39.540]  They found no evidence, okay?
[2:44:39.540 --> 2:44:42.740]  Nothing that showed collusion between the Russians
[2:44:42.740 --> 2:44:44.740]  and the Trump campaign.
[2:44:44.740 --> 2:44:47.420]  So what is the collusion?
[2:44:47.420 --> 2:44:50.260]  Because Sessions met with the Russian ambassador
[2:44:50.260 --> 2:44:55.020]  as an official as a senator, which is very common at that level.
[2:44:55.020 --> 2:44:58.580]  But what's even more common is political campaigns
[2:44:58.580 --> 2:45:02.100]  meet with foreign diplomats and foreign officials all the time.
[2:45:02.100 --> 2:45:04.740]  I'm sure Hillary's team had meetings with foreign officials.
[2:45:04.740 --> 2:45:05.780]  It's very common.
[2:45:05.780 --> 2:45:07.820]  Nothing wrong in a nefarious about that.
[2:45:07.820 --> 2:45:10.980]  And considering Trump wanted to reset the relationship
[2:45:10.980 --> 2:45:14.020]  with Russia, I happen to disagree that I think it's not
[2:45:14.020 --> 2:45:16.420]  going to work out, but I also think it's okay for Trump
[2:45:16.420 --> 2:45:19.460]  to try, that they had some meetings.
[2:45:19.460 --> 2:45:21.100]  To me, it's not unusual.
[2:45:21.100 --> 2:45:25.460]  And by Obama's own national intelligence report,
[2:45:25.460 --> 2:45:27.060]  there was no collusion.
[2:45:27.060 --> 2:45:29.060]  Should then you look at beyond that
[2:45:29.060 --> 2:45:30.780]  and you start thinking, well, why are they
[2:45:30.780 --> 2:45:35.300]  hyping this story day and night and even demanding
[2:45:35.300 --> 2:45:37.140]  a recusal of the Attorney General?
[2:45:37.140 --> 2:45:38.340]  Let's go back.
[2:45:38.340 --> 2:45:41.340]  When Obama targeted conservative nonprofits
[2:45:41.340 --> 2:45:44.620]  and political groups, he had a lady at the IRS
[2:45:44.620 --> 2:45:48.300]  who ran the unit who was over at his White House 24 times.
[2:45:48.300 --> 2:45:50.540]  It made no sense why she was over there.
[2:45:50.540 --> 2:45:53.980]  She testified, took the Fifth Amendment repeatedly
[2:45:53.980 --> 2:45:57.580]  to not disclose what happened and Obama's involvement.
[2:45:57.580 --> 2:45:59.980]  There was never a call for a special prosecutor.
[2:45:59.980 --> 2:46:01.420]  People got let off on that.
[2:46:01.420 --> 2:46:04.100]  It was an egregious abuse of power.
[2:46:04.100 --> 2:46:07.420]  And meanwhile, they're screaming because Trump's people
[2:46:07.420 --> 2:46:09.500]  met with the Russian ambassador a couple of times.
[2:46:09.500 --> 2:46:11.100]  It's ridiculous.
[2:46:11.100 --> 2:46:12.700]  Exactly, so what are they doing just playing
[2:46:12.700 --> 2:46:16.060]  on the public's ignorance of how politics at that level works?
[2:46:16.060 --> 2:46:18.580]  I mean, they just keep pushing it and pushing it
[2:46:18.580 --> 2:46:19.420]  and pushing it.
[2:46:21.020 --> 2:46:22.740]  Well, look, they don't have,
[2:46:22.740 --> 2:46:24.580]  they're very afraid of Donald Trump.
[2:46:24.580 --> 2:46:26.980]  He just beat a very popular Democrat
[2:46:26.980 --> 2:46:31.420]  who spent $1.5 billion, you know?
[2:46:31.420 --> 2:46:32.900]  And I've talked about this before,
[2:46:32.900 --> 2:46:35.620]  the best book I think on the Trump presidency
[2:46:35.620 --> 2:46:38.660]  is David Horowitz's book called Big Agenda.
[2:46:38.660 --> 2:46:40.700]  And he says in Big Agenda,
[2:46:40.700 --> 2:46:42.860]  everybody scoffed at it when the book first came out.
[2:46:42.860 --> 2:46:44.140]  It's now like three or four weeks
[2:46:44.140 --> 2:46:46.140]  on the New York Times bestseller list.
[2:46:46.140 --> 2:46:49.500]  But David said in Big Agenda that Obama was gonna create
[2:46:49.500 --> 2:46:51.540]  a government in exile to stop Trump.
[2:46:51.540 --> 2:46:52.820]  And now he's done exactly that.
[2:46:52.820 --> 2:46:54.940]  So either he was dead right
[2:46:54.940 --> 2:46:57.340]  or they're copying what Horowitz said.
[2:46:57.340 --> 2:47:01.220]  Well, no, no, I know Obama always planned to do it, yeah.
[2:47:01.220 --> 2:47:04.220]  Well, Horowitz does in his book that basically,
[2:47:05.620 --> 2:47:07.100]  Obama is an Olinsky guy.
[2:47:07.100 --> 2:47:09.900]  He's a solo Olinsky, rules for radicals.
[2:47:09.900 --> 2:47:11.340]  And he realizes what he's doing.
[2:47:11.340 --> 2:47:13.740]  He doesn't wanna give Trump a minute to breathe.
[2:47:13.740 --> 2:47:16.100]  He doesn't want him to compromise with the Democrats
[2:47:16.100 --> 2:47:18.300]  and work on things that benefit the country
[2:47:18.300 --> 2:47:19.820]  like infrastructure.
[2:47:19.820 --> 2:47:23.700]  So look at this, they leaked the president's
[2:47:23.700 --> 2:47:27.620]  most confidential discussions with heads of state,
[2:47:27.620 --> 2:47:29.980]  two heads of state that we know in Mexico and Australia.
[2:47:29.980 --> 2:47:32.420]  These are super secret documents.
[2:47:32.420 --> 2:47:34.820]  President gets on the phone with a head of state.
[2:47:34.820 --> 2:47:37.860]  Within several hours of those conversations,
[2:47:37.860 --> 2:47:39.700]  those ultra secret documents
[2:47:39.700 --> 2:47:41.860]  were leaked by Obama holdovers
[2:47:41.860 --> 2:47:43.260]  to the Washington Post of the media.
[2:47:43.260 --> 2:47:44.420]  And there's no dirt there.
[2:47:44.420 --> 2:47:46.220]  So they've committed the crime
[2:47:46.220 --> 2:47:47.580]  and they're trying to turn it around now
[2:47:47.580 --> 2:47:49.460]  and say they never did it.
[2:47:49.460 --> 2:47:52.060]  Well, there was no dirt, but it didn't let,
[2:47:52.060 --> 2:47:54.020]  there was a little bit of barristan stuff
[2:47:54.020 --> 2:47:56.740]  and there are things that they people mocked Trump
[2:47:56.740 --> 2:47:58.060]  for saying or whatever.
[2:47:58.060 --> 2:48:00.020]  But the point is, it's a crime.
[2:48:00.020 --> 2:48:01.460]  Nobody's calling for a special guard.
[2:48:01.460 --> 2:48:04.980]  Why aren't the media and CNN talking about that?
[2:48:04.980 --> 2:48:07.180]  And they're talking about a couple of meetings
[2:48:07.180 --> 2:48:08.700]  with the Russian ambassador.
[2:48:08.700 --> 2:48:11.060]  Now, look, I'm for all for investigations.
[2:48:11.060 --> 2:48:12.100]  I'm a member of the press.
[2:48:12.100 --> 2:48:14.740]  I don't care if it's a Republican or a Democrat.
[2:48:14.740 --> 2:48:16.380]  Every side should be held accountable.
[2:48:16.380 --> 2:48:19.220]  But what I really did test from the media
[2:48:19.220 --> 2:48:21.980]  is the fact they only go after Republicans
[2:48:21.980 --> 2:48:23.740]  and they give Democrats a free pass.
[2:48:23.740 --> 2:48:24.700]  I totally agree.
[2:48:24.700 --> 2:48:26.300]  And his approval rating is only going up.
[2:48:26.300 --> 2:48:27.660]  I think this is backfiring.
[2:48:27.660 --> 2:48:30.340]  And Chris Reddy, CEO and founder of Newsmax.com.
[2:48:30.340 --> 2:48:32.540]  I mean, what do you think about this overall climate?
[2:48:34.460 --> 2:48:37.580]  Well, I think it's difficult climate for the president,
[2:48:37.580 --> 2:48:39.420]  but I think the polling numbers,
[2:48:39.420 --> 2:48:40.740]  when he has likely voters,
[2:48:40.740 --> 2:48:42.540]  he actually comes out pretty good.
[2:48:42.540 --> 2:48:44.420]  Because the public's seeing through some of this,
[2:48:44.420 --> 2:48:46.300]  you know, the things that the media is saying
[2:48:46.300 --> 2:48:48.180]  and the Washington establishment.
[2:48:49.260 --> 2:48:51.580]  So I think he has a real shot.
[2:48:51.580 --> 2:48:54.100]  Look, that speech he gave before Congress
[2:48:54.100 --> 2:48:55.580]  was one of the best speeches.
[2:48:55.580 --> 2:48:56.420]  I saw the president-
[2:48:56.420 --> 2:48:57.380]  It was one of the best ever.
[2:48:57.380 --> 2:48:58.900]  That's why he's so pissed, reportedly.
[2:48:58.900 --> 2:49:00.020]  You talked to him, though,
[2:49:00.020 --> 2:49:01.500]  that the fact that he got overshadowed
[2:49:01.500 --> 2:49:02.900]  by the stupid sessions thing.
[2:49:04.460 --> 2:49:06.580]  Well, he never raised sessions.
[2:49:06.580 --> 2:49:08.340]  I never talked to him about sessions.
[2:49:08.340 --> 2:49:09.580]  That was not even a discussion.
[2:49:09.580 --> 2:49:10.420]  Let me ask you this, then.
[2:49:10.420 --> 2:49:11.580]  What else did he say?
[2:49:15.380 --> 2:49:17.420]  Well, if I told you, I'd have to kill you.
[2:49:17.420 --> 2:49:19.020]  I'm sure I know you guys are-
[2:49:19.020 --> 2:49:19.860]  No, I mean-
[2:49:19.860 --> 2:49:21.260]  No, we didn't.
[2:49:21.260 --> 2:49:22.340]  What he did say was,
[2:49:22.340 --> 2:49:24.020]  when I asked him later in the new year,
[2:49:24.020 --> 2:49:26.660]  he said, how's the press story developing on this?
[2:49:26.660 --> 2:49:29.140]  I said, well, they're coming out with claims and aisles.
[2:49:29.140 --> 2:49:31.380]  He said, look, they're gonna investigate it.
[2:49:31.380 --> 2:49:32.620]  And there's truth will come out
[2:49:32.620 --> 2:49:33.860]  and I will be proven right.
[2:49:33.860 --> 2:49:36.380]  And I put that on my Newsmax blog.
[2:49:36.380 --> 2:49:39.100]  So he knows more than he's revealing.
[2:49:39.100 --> 2:49:39.940]  Now, he-
[2:49:39.940 --> 2:49:40.780]  Well, of course, he's the president.
[2:49:40.780 --> 2:49:44.300]  Plus, I mean, the Intelligence Committee head
[2:49:44.300 --> 2:49:46.300]  says they have all the recordings
[2:49:46.300 --> 2:49:47.260]  and there's nothing there.
[2:49:47.260 --> 2:49:48.620]  So they did surveilling.
[2:49:49.660 --> 2:49:51.420]  Well, and if you look at the denials
[2:49:51.420 --> 2:49:53.060]  that are coming out, they're not really,
[2:49:53.060 --> 2:49:54.940]  they're lawyerly denial.
[2:49:54.940 --> 2:49:58.260]  They'll say, well, President Obama did not order it
[2:49:58.260 --> 2:50:01.500]  or he was not ordered against Trump Tower.
[2:50:01.500 --> 2:50:03.220]  Or Trump doesn't have proof.
[2:50:03.220 --> 2:50:08.220]  Well, he was very confident in the information
[2:50:08.620 --> 2:50:12.260]  that he gave to me and to the public.
[2:50:12.260 --> 2:50:15.300]  So I think we should give him the benefit of the doubt
[2:50:15.300 --> 2:50:17.700]  and that should be an investigation like he said.
[2:50:17.700 --> 2:50:19.500]  Well, sure, but I mean, Chris, Chris, Chris.
[2:50:19.500 --> 2:50:20.860]  Why do they assume he's making it up?
[2:50:20.860 --> 2:50:22.460]  You follow the news every day like I do.
[2:50:22.460 --> 2:50:24.260]  Remember, they were like, we have Flynn,
[2:50:24.260 --> 2:50:26.940]  we have transcripts, New York Times, it's all this stuff.
[2:50:26.940 --> 2:50:28.740]  And when the Congress finally got it was nothing.
[2:50:28.740 --> 2:50:32.140]  I mean, they put out lies claiming they had surveillance.
[2:50:32.140 --> 2:50:34.540]  They did, it didn't show anything.
[2:50:34.540 --> 2:50:36.700]  So now Trump wants Congress to release it
[2:50:36.700 --> 2:50:38.740]  so everybody can see they committed crimes
[2:50:38.740 --> 2:50:40.940]  and all he's doing is working for the people.
[2:50:42.700 --> 2:50:46.340]  Yeah, I mean, I think this is a very difficult job
[2:50:46.340 --> 2:50:48.380]  for this president because he's not a politician.
[2:50:48.380 --> 2:50:51.500]  He's not an insider and they really wanna torpedo
[2:50:51.500 --> 2:50:55.180]  on Franklin Obama's working day and night, his holdovers.
[2:50:55.180 --> 2:50:56.020]  No, and I agree.
[2:50:56.020 --> 2:50:57.100]  And I think he's genuinely pissed
[2:50:57.100 --> 2:50:58.860]  that he really wants to help the average person
[2:50:58.860 --> 2:50:59.860]  and even corporations.
[2:50:59.860 --> 2:51:01.540]  And he just can't believe I kept saying
[2:51:01.540 --> 2:51:03.580]  during that first speech of Congress,
[2:51:03.580 --> 2:51:04.940]  he kept saying, work with me.
[2:51:04.940 --> 2:51:06.620]  All I'm trying to do is help the country.
[2:51:06.620 --> 2:51:07.700]  What's your problem?
[2:51:07.700 --> 2:51:09.740]  And then Pelosi wouldn't even stand up
[2:51:09.740 --> 2:51:11.460]  when he talked about getting people jobs
[2:51:11.460 --> 2:51:13.700]  and stopping illegals, murdering people.
[2:51:13.700 --> 2:51:14.780]  And they boot that.
[2:51:14.780 --> 2:51:16.820]  I mean, where do you, Chris, you're a smart guy.
[2:51:16.820 --> 2:51:17.660]  I don't just say that pattern.
[2:51:17.660 --> 2:51:18.900]  I was like, you're obviously a smart guy.
[2:51:18.900 --> 2:51:20.260]  Where do you see all this going?
[2:51:20.260 --> 2:51:21.820]  I mean, right now in your gut,
[2:51:21.820 --> 2:51:23.260]  I mean, I think Trump's gonna succeed,
[2:51:23.260 --> 2:51:24.700]  but boy, these are dangerous waters.
[2:51:24.700 --> 2:51:26.420]  And I'm actually upset.
[2:51:26.420 --> 2:51:30.700]  I don't get off on the Democrats being so dumb,
[2:51:30.700 --> 2:51:33.820]  having press conferences with Maxine Waters saying,
[2:51:33.820 --> 2:51:38.660]  Russia invaded Korea and Bush is still in office, Pelosi.
[2:51:38.660 --> 2:51:40.900]  I mean, the Democrats keep saying on their own shows,
[2:51:40.900 --> 2:51:42.260]  isn't it time for new leadership?
[2:51:42.260 --> 2:51:44.580]  And Pelosi's like, no, we're doing wonderful.
[2:51:44.580 --> 2:51:46.860]  So I mean, I guess that's maybe our best friend.
[2:51:46.860 --> 2:51:48.500]  Is that they're so disconnected?
[2:51:49.820 --> 2:51:52.580]  Well, I don't know how disconnected they are.
[2:51:52.580 --> 2:51:54.140]  They seem to be pretty organized
[2:51:54.140 --> 2:51:56.140]  during attacks against the president.
[2:51:57.060 --> 2:51:58.980]  I don't know where it's all going, frankly.
[2:51:58.980 --> 2:52:01.140]  I do think that, you know,
[2:52:01.140 --> 2:52:03.140]  I believe that Trump is in the right
[2:52:03.140 --> 2:52:06.940]  on most of the stuff that he's been saying that the issue is,
[2:52:06.940 --> 2:52:08.860]  he is still in a bit of a campaign mode
[2:52:08.860 --> 2:52:09.900]  using their Twitter.
[2:52:09.900 --> 2:52:12.540]  I think they're gonna need to readjust that.
[2:52:12.540 --> 2:52:14.780]  And if somebody asked me, nobody's asked me,
[2:52:14.780 --> 2:52:19.020]  I would advise them to use Twitter in a different way.
[2:52:19.020 --> 2:52:21.260]  But I would continue to do what he's doing,
[2:52:21.260 --> 2:52:24.580]  which is going directly to the American people,
[2:52:24.580 --> 2:52:26.620]  including like going on shows like yours
[2:52:26.620 --> 2:52:28.180]  or Newsmax or others,
[2:52:28.180 --> 2:52:31.500]  and talking to them and not get angry at the media,
[2:52:31.500 --> 2:52:34.580]  just bypass them and ignore them and drive them crazy.
[2:52:34.580 --> 2:52:38.660]  That's exactly what I said last night in a special report.
[2:52:38.660 --> 2:52:39.660]  I said, Mr. President,
[2:52:39.660 --> 2:52:41.460]  you put out these tweets that are great,
[2:52:41.460 --> 2:52:42.820]  that are true when you say, hey,
[2:52:42.820 --> 2:52:44.180]  they admit they surveilled me.
[2:52:44.180 --> 2:52:46.460]  Well, yeah, but you gotta put a link to where they said it.
[2:52:46.460 --> 2:52:48.780]  If you put a link to like a briefing report,
[2:52:48.780 --> 2:52:51.500]  then maybe Newsmax helped him or Breitbart did or whatever.
[2:52:51.500 --> 2:52:53.580]  And then the facts he's laying out,
[2:52:53.580 --> 2:52:54.780]  then it's incontrovertible.
[2:52:54.780 --> 2:52:56.660]  They can just deny a tweet.
[2:52:56.660 --> 2:52:58.500]  I mean, what if he did say twice a week,
[2:52:58.500 --> 2:53:02.020]  a 30 minute fireside chat like Roosevelt did,
[2:53:02.020 --> 2:53:05.300]  where he had like a big computer screen with production,
[2:53:05.300 --> 2:53:07.420]  where he just shows his facts
[2:53:07.420 --> 2:53:09.420]  and then totally proves where they're lying,
[2:53:09.420 --> 2:53:12.460]  but then also talks about what he's done for the people,
[2:53:12.460 --> 2:53:13.700]  totally bypassing him.
[2:53:13.700 --> 2:53:16.260]  I think not even in a negative attack way,
[2:53:16.260 --> 2:53:17.780]  but actually saying what he's doing.
[2:53:17.780 --> 2:53:19.900]  I think that's what he needs to do.
[2:53:19.900 --> 2:53:22.780]  Oh, I agree, that would be very powerful.
[2:53:22.780 --> 2:53:23.900]  You know, back in the day,
[2:53:23.900 --> 2:53:25.580]  Ross Perot really caught fire
[2:53:25.580 --> 2:53:27.820]  when he did a couple of those seminars nationally.
[2:53:27.820 --> 2:53:30.740]  This was before there was Fox News or radio shows
[2:53:30.740 --> 2:53:32.580]  like yours or even Newsmax and he-
[2:53:32.580 --> 2:53:35.420]  He went to number one with just a few of those.
[2:53:35.420 --> 2:53:38.260]  Yeah, people eat it up because they're talking
[2:53:38.260 --> 2:53:41.620]  not about the showing facts and showing a plan.
[2:53:41.620 --> 2:53:44.420]  And I do think, you know, I've never seen him more excited
[2:53:44.420 --> 2:53:47.140]  than when he talks about job programs.
[2:53:47.140 --> 2:53:49.980]  He really wants to restore the American job worker
[2:53:49.980 --> 2:53:53.340]  and the employment situation in this country.
[2:53:53.340 --> 2:53:56.020]  And he's really motivated by, in the end of the day,
[2:53:56.020 --> 2:53:58.900]  it doesn't matter if he does send a tweet or two,
[2:53:58.900 --> 2:54:01.180]  if he brings economic growth back to the levels
[2:54:01.180 --> 2:54:04.300]  that he says he wants to, we're gonna be in good shape
[2:54:04.300 --> 2:54:06.380]  and he will win reelection.
[2:54:06.380 --> 2:54:07.980]  Well, undoubtedly he knows he can move quicker
[2:54:07.980 --> 2:54:09.340]  with executive actions instead of trying
[2:54:09.340 --> 2:54:10.380]  to pass laws in Congress.
[2:54:10.380 --> 2:54:12.460]  But a lot of folks say, well, do it through Congress,
[2:54:12.460 --> 2:54:13.300]  then it's bulletproof.
[2:54:13.300 --> 2:54:16.500]  But absolutely, he knows that if he just takes the foot
[2:54:16.500 --> 2:54:18.740]  off our neck, but the globalist put there,
[2:54:18.740 --> 2:54:21.580]  it'll be so explosive that we're gonna be voting
[2:54:21.580 --> 2:54:23.620]  Trump Republicanism for another 50 years,
[2:54:23.620 --> 2:54:24.940]  100 years like Bannon says.
[2:54:24.940 --> 2:54:27.140]  But I think that's why we're in such a death battle.
[2:54:27.140 --> 2:54:30.100]  The Democrats now call it a death battle to bring down Trump
[2:54:30.100 --> 2:54:31.900]  because it's like the end of their world.
[2:54:31.900 --> 2:54:35.340]  They're like kamikazes in 1945 coming into the,
[2:54:35.340 --> 2:54:37.540]  you know, the Lexington and the Pacific Ocean.
[2:54:37.540 --> 2:54:39.620]  They're not gonna give up, Chris.
[2:54:39.620 --> 2:54:40.460]  Well, I hate to say it,
[2:54:40.460 --> 2:54:42.260]  they are a little bit like caged animals.
[2:54:42.260 --> 2:54:46.300]  You know, you know, they lost the House, the Senate,
[2:54:46.300 --> 2:54:48.300]  they're not gonna gain many seats in the Senate
[2:54:48.300 --> 2:54:49.860]  in the next election.
[2:54:49.860 --> 2:54:52.700]  They lost 30 to control of 33 states.
[2:54:52.700 --> 2:54:54.860]  There's only six states they control.
[2:54:54.860 --> 2:54:56.300]  The only big one is California.
[2:54:56.300 --> 2:54:59.220]  There are the little states like Rhode Island and Delaware.
[2:54:59.220 --> 2:55:00.740]  They're in bad shape.
[2:55:00.740 --> 2:55:03.100]  They're gonna lose control of the judiciary.
[2:55:03.100 --> 2:55:04.620]  Everywhere across the country,
[2:55:04.620 --> 2:55:06.860]  I don't think they've smelled the coffee yet.
[2:55:06.860 --> 2:55:08.180]  They're not in a good position.
[2:55:08.180 --> 2:55:10.820]  And instead of trying to work and get things done,
[2:55:10.820 --> 2:55:12.820]  they're playing the obstruction role here.
[2:55:12.820 --> 2:55:16.260]  And I think it's backfiring with the American people.
[2:55:16.260 --> 2:55:18.020]  That's right, when the Republicans played obstruction
[2:55:18.020 --> 2:55:19.900]  just blocking the globalist agenda, it was good
[2:55:19.900 --> 2:55:21.100]  because the people wanted that.
[2:55:21.100 --> 2:55:23.060]  Now the people want freedom.
[2:55:23.060 --> 2:55:23.980]  They want prosperity.
[2:55:23.980 --> 2:55:25.260]  They want America back.
[2:55:25.260 --> 2:55:27.940]  They want 1950, 2.0 for everybody.
[2:55:27.940 --> 2:55:29.460]  And they just better get out of the way.
[2:55:29.460 --> 2:55:31.260]  And that's not Ravada.
[2:55:31.260 --> 2:55:32.460]  That's just a historical fact.
[2:55:32.460 --> 2:55:34.700]  All right, well, chrisreadynewsmax.com.
[2:55:34.700 --> 2:55:35.740]  We got 60 seconds left.
[2:55:35.740 --> 2:55:37.860]  Thanks for popping in with this exclusive here
[2:55:37.860 --> 2:55:40.300]  with us, any final points?
[2:55:40.300 --> 2:55:42.220]  Well, you know, I'm pushing the book.
[2:55:42.220 --> 2:55:44.380]  David Harwood's big agenda, get it.
[2:55:44.380 --> 2:55:46.740]  It's the best book on the Trump presidency.
[2:55:46.740 --> 2:55:48.580]  We want him back on, he was on, he was great.
[2:55:48.580 --> 2:55:50.380]  So let's get him back on next week.
[2:55:50.380 --> 2:55:52.540]  I'm gonna tell him right now that he's coming on.
[2:55:52.540 --> 2:55:54.780]  You're the most important show on the internet.
[2:55:56.100 --> 2:55:57.500]  All right, well, thank you so much.
[2:55:57.500 --> 2:55:58.820]  Again, that's from Newsmax.
[2:55:58.820 --> 2:56:00.420]  The big agenda, I haven't read it yet.
[2:56:00.420 --> 2:56:02.620]  I know I read his, 12 years ago,
[2:56:02.620 --> 2:56:04.620]  I read his Unholy Alliance.
[2:56:04.620 --> 2:56:05.740]  I thought it was crazy.
[2:56:05.740 --> 2:56:06.900]  Now it all came true.
[2:56:06.900 --> 2:56:08.060]  Horror was his smart.
[2:56:09.660 --> 2:56:10.500]  Well, he understands,
[2:56:10.500 --> 2:56:13.140]  because he was a former leftist revolutionary
[2:56:13.140 --> 2:56:15.180]  and he came over to our side.
[2:56:15.180 --> 2:56:16.660]  So he knows how they work.
[2:56:16.660 --> 2:56:18.060]  He tried his parents for communists.
[2:56:18.060 --> 2:56:19.060]  All right, Chris, great job.
[2:56:19.060 --> 2:56:20.340]  Thank you.
[2:56:20.340 --> 2:56:21.180]  Thank you.
[2:56:21.180 --> 2:56:22.020]  Bye, Alex.
[2:56:22.020 --> 2:56:22.860]  That's amazing.
[2:56:22.860 --> 2:56:24.220]  I've read two of his books
[2:56:24.220 --> 2:56:25.140]  and I mean, I was reading these going,
[2:56:25.140 --> 2:56:26.900]  this guy is just out of control fear
[2:56:26.900 --> 2:56:28.220]  and then it all came true.
[2:56:29.820 --> 2:56:31.500]  You gotta pay attention to David Harwood's.
[2:56:31.500 --> 2:56:35.020]  I just can't believe these people are that evil.
[2:56:35.020 --> 2:56:36.660]  I mean, they are just control freaks
[2:56:36.660 --> 2:56:39.340]  who literally know they're making us poor
[2:56:39.340 --> 2:56:41.020]  and want to control everybody.
[2:56:41.020 --> 2:56:42.260]  And it's so uncool.
[2:56:43.260 --> 2:56:45.580]  I got no insurer taking over.
[2:56:45.580 --> 2:56:46.420]  He does a great job.
[2:56:46.420 --> 2:56:47.260]  It's the Sunday show.
[2:56:47.260 --> 2:56:48.260]  I guess he's the only host today.
[2:56:48.260 --> 2:56:49.100]  A lot of times, David Knight does,
[2:56:49.100 --> 2:56:50.380]  they all do a great job.
[2:56:50.380 --> 2:56:52.260]  We're gonna be adding more shows here soon.
[2:56:52.260 --> 2:56:54.940]  I hope to work with GCN on that as well.
[2:56:54.940 --> 2:56:56.500]  But I want to start going live
[2:56:57.380 --> 2:56:59.660]  in the next few months with shows at four a.m.
[2:56:59.660 --> 2:57:02.140]  so that we get to jump on all the news and analysis.
[2:57:02.140 --> 2:57:04.300]  I mean, really, I've learned the morning and the days,
[2:57:04.300 --> 2:57:05.140]  the time.
[2:57:05.140 --> 2:57:05.980]  I mean, nighttime's great,
[2:57:05.980 --> 2:57:07.020]  but we're so geared towards the nightly news
[2:57:07.020 --> 2:57:09.180]  and everything's kind of stacked up on that.
[2:57:09.180 --> 2:57:11.820]  And that's, they do a great job on the nightly news,
[2:57:11.820 --> 2:57:16.820]  but I want to get like six, seven, eight more video, TV,
[2:57:17.100 --> 2:57:18.860]  operators, you'll producers,
[2:57:18.860 --> 2:57:22.500]  hosts can run a multimedia TV network slash radio network
[2:57:22.500 --> 2:57:23.740]  and some other crew I want to get in here
[2:57:23.740 --> 2:57:26.340]  and some other hosts and I'm just all in.
[2:57:26.340 --> 2:57:28.060]  I'm just spitting everything we got
[2:57:28.060 --> 2:57:29.300]  just to expand the face of this
[2:57:29.300 --> 2:57:30.500]  because I'm not going to sit here later
[2:57:30.500 --> 2:57:32.860]  and lose this thing and wish I wouldn't have done 100%.
[2:57:32.860 --> 2:57:34.780]  If I go 100% and we lose,
[2:57:34.780 --> 2:57:36.100]  I got God to deal with it.
[2:57:36.100 --> 2:57:37.860]  I know I feel good.
[2:57:37.860 --> 2:57:40.780]  My fear is if I don't go 100%
[2:57:40.780 --> 2:57:42.660]  and then we lose, then it's my fault.
[2:57:42.660 --> 2:57:46.300]  And so we're 100% as best we can.
[2:57:46.300 --> 2:57:47.620]  That'd mean I'm perfect.
[2:57:47.620 --> 2:57:48.580]  I say that very humbly.
[2:57:48.580 --> 2:57:51.580]  I ask for your prayers and I ask for your financial support
[2:57:51.580 --> 2:57:52.580]  because I only plug once today.
[2:57:52.580 --> 2:57:53.980]  They're like every second you got to plug,
[2:57:53.980 --> 2:57:56.020]  Alex, we need to bring money in,
[2:57:56.020 --> 2:57:57.860]  but just get the nutraceuticals, get the t-shirts,
[2:57:57.860 --> 2:58:00.140]  get the non-GMO seeds, get the heirloom seeds,
[2:58:00.140 --> 2:58:03.500]  get the water filtration systems in forstore.com.
[2:58:03.500 --> 2:58:04.500]  We're not funded by the globalists.
[2:58:04.500 --> 2:58:05.340]  We're not funded by big money.
[2:58:05.340 --> 2:58:06.980]  We're just funded by you.
[2:58:06.980 --> 2:58:09.860]  50% off the new Trump pants, 2020 shirt,
[2:58:09.860 --> 2:58:11.660]  keeping America great.
[2:58:11.660 --> 2:58:14.780]  America first since 1776.
[2:58:14.780 --> 2:58:16.260]  All right, I'm gonna go ahead
[2:58:16.260 --> 2:58:18.340]  and end this transmission myself.
[2:58:19.340 --> 2:58:24.340]  The fourth hour will be hosted by the mighty SJW Slayer.
[2:58:24.900 --> 2:58:29.900]  Owen Sriar from the Shelby State, Missouri.
[2:58:29.900 --> 2:58:37.540]  Now in Austin, Texas, straight ahead in T-minus 70 seconds.
[2:58:37.540 --> 2:58:39.340]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:39.340 --> 2:59:01.340]  Visit GCNLive.com today.

[2:59:31.380 --> 2:59:33.260]  And from our research, it's something that men
[2:59:33.260 --> 2:59:35.460]  should really be adding to their daily regimen

[2:59:48.740 --> 3:00:15.740]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:00:15.740 --> 3:00:28.180]  Be Liberty or Give Me Death is Alex Jones.
[3:00:28.180 --> 3:00:30.660]  All right, thrust right into the driver's seat
[3:00:30.660 --> 3:00:32.780]  here of the Alex Jones Show.
[3:00:32.780 --> 3:00:36.660]  Owen Schreuer, we will be with you till 3 o'clock central.
[3:00:36.660 --> 3:00:38.460]  I've got some news that I want to cover,
[3:00:38.460 --> 3:00:40.500]  but I would like to open up the phone lines
[3:00:40.500 --> 3:00:42.780]  in the second half of this hour.
[3:00:42.780 --> 3:00:44.900]  And here are from you guys out there.
[3:00:44.900 --> 3:00:48.620]  Just what are you feeling, especially considering
[3:00:48.620 --> 3:00:51.020]  all the attacks on Trump and how they're obviously
[3:00:51.020 --> 3:00:53.060]  not going to give up?
[3:00:53.060 --> 3:00:58.460]  The only end to the push we're seeing against Donald Trump
[3:00:58.460 --> 3:01:01.700]  right now is a complete overthrow of our republic.
[3:01:01.700 --> 3:01:03.300]  And that's the big story.
[3:01:03.300 --> 3:01:05.380]  And the civil war that's happening right now
[3:01:05.380 --> 3:01:07.980]  in American politics is undeniable.
[3:01:07.980 --> 3:01:11.580]  All these people that have been living in the dark for years
[3:01:11.580 --> 3:01:14.260]  can no longer deny what they're seeing in front of their face.
[3:01:14.260 --> 3:01:19.740]  And that is all out civil war for the future of this country.
[3:01:19.740 --> 3:01:22.060]  So let's go to some of the news that I want to cover here,
[3:01:22.060 --> 3:01:24.540]  because here's the thing.
[3:01:24.540 --> 3:01:29.220]  I can take the issues that Donald Trump talks about.
[3:01:29.220 --> 3:01:31.860]  I can take the policies that Donald Trump wants
[3:01:31.860 --> 3:01:34.500]  to bring to this country.
[3:01:34.500 --> 3:01:38.780]  And you can explain it in real time with news stories
[3:01:38.780 --> 3:01:44.020]  about why the policies are right and about why he's not
[3:01:44.020 --> 3:01:45.220]  just making this stuff up.
[3:01:45.220 --> 3:01:47.460]  The big one yesterday when I hosted the show,
[3:01:47.460 --> 3:01:51.820]  I covered these two illegal aliens that were Satan worshipers
[3:01:51.820 --> 3:01:54.060]  that raped and murdered young women.
[3:01:54.060 --> 3:01:57.100]  They came here, they were living illegally, folks.
[3:01:57.100 --> 3:01:59.340]  Yet when Donald Trump gets up on the podium
[3:01:59.340 --> 3:02:03.380]  and says we've got criminal illegal immigrants coming here,
[3:02:03.380 --> 3:02:06.260]  raping and killing people, people throw their hands in the air
[3:02:06.260 --> 3:02:07.060]  and they get shocked.
[3:02:07.060 --> 3:02:08.660]  They can't even believe it.
[3:02:08.660 --> 3:02:11.620]  How could he come out and say something like this?
[3:02:11.620 --> 3:02:13.340]  It's so wrong.
[3:02:13.340 --> 3:02:15.660]  No, it's so right.
[3:02:15.660 --> 3:02:20.180]  Here is a story that just broke from World Net Daily.
[3:02:20.180 --> 3:02:25.420]  FBI probes 300 refugees in the United States for terrorism.
[3:02:25.420 --> 3:02:27.460]  Feds reveal as Trump administration
[3:02:27.460 --> 3:02:29.660]  announces the revised travel ban order,
[3:02:29.660 --> 3:02:31.620]  which I'm not going to go off on a jag on that.
[3:02:31.620 --> 3:02:33.580]  I don't really understand the revision of the travel ban,
[3:02:33.580 --> 3:02:35.540]  but nonetheless, he has done that.
[3:02:35.540 --> 3:02:38.260]  So here's this story, though.
[3:02:38.260 --> 3:02:42.460]  More than 300 people, this is coming from Jeff Sessions,
[3:02:42.460 --> 3:02:44.860]  more than 300 people who came here as refugees
[3:02:44.860 --> 3:02:46.940]  are under an FBI investigation today
[3:02:46.940 --> 3:02:50.780]  for potential terrorism-related activities.
[3:02:50.780 --> 3:02:54.460]  Of course, you couldn't be shocked if you heard
[3:02:54.460 --> 3:02:59.660]  that these refugees came under the Obama administration.
[3:02:59.660 --> 3:03:02.260]  And all you have to do is a little math.
[3:03:02.260 --> 3:03:06.900]  Now, I'm not that great at math, but I can do simple math.
[3:03:06.900 --> 3:03:13.140]  Let's see, if we take 100,000 refugees from the Middle East,
[3:03:13.140 --> 3:03:15.940]  Syria, let's say Somalia is in there.
[3:03:15.940 --> 3:03:18.100]  That's still on the travel ban, though.
[3:03:18.100 --> 3:03:23.580]  If we take 100,000 and just 1% of them are terrorists,
[3:03:23.580 --> 3:03:25.780]  that's 10,000, or that's 1,000 terrorists.
[3:03:25.780 --> 3:03:27.860]  Excuse me, see even simple math I struggle with.
[3:03:27.860 --> 3:03:32.060]  If you take half of a percent, that's 500 terrorists, folks.
[3:03:32.060 --> 3:03:33.140]  So here you go.
[3:03:33.140 --> 3:03:34.340]  So here's your numbers.
[3:03:34.340 --> 3:03:37.620]  More than 300 are being pro-for-terrorism.
[3:03:37.620 --> 3:03:40.580]  Why does the news act like Donald Trump is crazy
[3:03:40.580 --> 3:03:41.620]  when he says this?
[3:03:41.620 --> 3:03:44.260]  Why do the protesters act like Donald Trump is crazy
[3:03:44.260 --> 3:03:46.660]  when he brings this up?
[3:03:46.660 --> 3:03:52.020]  Why is it considered racist to want to have a border?
[3:03:52.020 --> 3:03:54.660]  This is the absolute madness that we're living under.
[3:03:54.660 --> 3:03:56.220]  I mean, I can't even believe this, folks.
[3:03:56.220 --> 3:03:58.220]  Look at this.
[3:03:58.220 --> 3:04:00.580]  Barack Obama, this just shows you anybody
[3:04:00.580 --> 3:04:06.220]  who follows Barack Obama still is a complete nitwit.
[3:04:06.220 --> 3:04:10.660]  You have Barack Obama coming out and saying, well, first,
[3:04:10.660 --> 3:04:11.940]  he comes out when he's campaigning,
[3:04:11.940 --> 3:04:14.140]  and he says, well, we've got a lot of rigged elections
[3:04:14.140 --> 3:04:14.860]  here in America.
[3:04:14.860 --> 3:04:16.380]  The elections might not be fair.
[3:04:16.380 --> 3:04:18.420]  We'll have to look into that when he's campaigning.
[3:04:18.420 --> 3:04:19.460]  Then he gets in.
[3:04:19.460 --> 3:04:21.860]  Trump hints at possibility of a rigged election,
[3:04:21.860 --> 3:04:23.780]  and all of a sudden, Obama changes his tune.
[3:04:23.780 --> 3:04:25.900]  He says he's never heard of a rigged election.
[3:04:25.900 --> 3:04:27.780]  There's no such thing as a rigged election,
[3:04:27.780 --> 3:04:29.580]  even though he campaigned on that ground.
[3:04:29.580 --> 3:04:31.900]  But then he comes out, and he says,
[3:04:31.900 --> 3:04:33.380]  Russia is rigging the election.
[3:04:33.380 --> 3:04:35.300]  So Obama says, no such thing as a rigged election
[3:04:35.300 --> 3:04:36.740]  after he says the elections are rigged.
[3:04:36.740 --> 3:04:38.460]  Then he says, Russia is rigging the election.
[3:04:38.460 --> 3:04:40.740]  Then he says, I want a full report
[3:04:40.740 --> 3:04:43.420]  on the investigation of Russian ties to Donald Trump
[3:04:43.420 --> 3:04:44.300]  on my desk.
[3:04:44.300 --> 3:04:46.380]  But then he comes out and says, we never investigated.
[3:04:46.380 --> 3:04:47.700]  We never wiretapped him.
[3:04:47.700 --> 3:04:49.260]  These people are complete liars.
[3:04:49.260 --> 3:04:51.380]  More of the Alex Jones Fourth Hour on the other side.
[3:04:51.380 --> 3:05:02.020]  I'm beginning to think Mexico's border policy
[3:05:02.020 --> 3:05:04.820]  and immigration policy is whatever goes against Trump.
[3:05:04.820 --> 3:05:07.060]  In an unprecedented move, the Mexican government
[3:05:07.060 --> 3:05:10.220]  is now paying $50 million to give legal support
[3:05:10.220 --> 3:05:12.860]  to Mexican nationals living in the US illegally.
[3:05:12.860 --> 3:05:14.780]  So Mexico won't pay for a wall, but they
[3:05:14.780 --> 3:05:17.620]  will pay for people who leave Mexico for the United States,
[3:05:17.620 --> 3:05:18.860]  I guess, because it's better.
[3:05:18.860 --> 3:05:20.620]  If you do so legally, though, they
[3:05:20.620 --> 3:05:21.780]  have no funding for you.
[3:05:21.780 --> 3:05:23.700]  All 50 Mexican consulates to the US
[3:05:23.700 --> 3:05:26.220]  are launching legal assistance centers for Mexican nationals
[3:05:26.220 --> 3:05:28.980]  living in the US illegally who are fearing deportation.
[3:05:28.980 --> 3:05:31.540]  In contrast, however, I cannot go to Mexico
[3:05:31.540 --> 3:05:34.340]  and have the US government pay any legal fees I may incur
[3:05:34.340 --> 3:05:35.580]  for migrating illegally.
[3:05:35.580 --> 3:05:38.700]  And why would Mexico pay people who left their country?
[3:05:38.700 --> 3:05:41.540]  Is Mexico that bad they just refuse to go back?
[3:05:41.540 --> 3:05:43.940]  Or are the people that left Mexico that bad
[3:05:43.940 --> 3:05:45.780]  they're paying to keep them out?
[3:05:45.780 --> 3:05:48.900]  No, I think any anti-Trump politicians from anywhere
[3:05:48.900 --> 3:05:52.140]  on Earth have now abandoned all logic, all common sense,
[3:05:52.140 --> 3:05:54.500]  all true policy and diplomacy, an attempt
[3:05:54.500 --> 3:05:57.060]  to go against anything President Trump tries to do.
[3:05:57.060 --> 3:05:59.580]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[3:05:59.580 --> 3:06:02.940]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[3:06:02.940 --> 3:06:04.140]  They lost.
[3:06:04.140 --> 3:06:05.420]  We won.
[3:06:05.420 --> 3:06:07.700]  Want to see what Trump's up against.
[3:06:07.700 --> 3:06:10.740]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[3:06:10.740 --> 3:06:13.260]  Because of what we did on this day,
[3:06:13.260 --> 3:06:15.460]  change has come to America.
[3:06:15.460 --> 3:06:18.940]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces,
[3:06:18.940 --> 3:06:21.220]  bent on global governance.
[3:06:21.220 --> 3:06:25.740]  When I was a boy, it was OK to be proud of the flag, heritage,
[3:06:25.740 --> 3:06:30.820]  mom and apple pie, gobs and school, morality had a future,
[3:06:30.820 --> 3:06:33.620]  and beef was for supper.
[3:06:33.620 --> 3:06:36.420]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[3:06:36.420 --> 3:06:37.540]  We're the solution.
[3:06:37.540 --> 3:06:40.100]  Americans ain't nothing more to it than that.
[3:06:40.100 --> 3:06:42.860]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels,
[3:06:42.860 --> 3:06:45.500]  Ben Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin,
[3:06:45.500 --> 3:06:49.100]  theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[3:06:49.100 --> 3:06:52.500]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue?
[3:06:52.500 --> 3:06:55.220]  Americans need to see this film.
[3:06:55.220 --> 3:06:57.980]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[3:06:57.980 --> 3:06:59.500]  Let's fix it.
[3:06:59.500 --> 3:07:01.500]  Please listen carefully, because I'm

[3:08:25.260 --> 3:08:27.780]  in the streets, I'm a super caveman.
[3:08:27.780 --> 3:08:31.780]  And you can be too now with the ultimate paleo formula

[3:08:40.820 --> 3:08:41.540]  You're going to love it.
[3:08:41.540 --> 3:08:42.980]  And you're going to come back and get some more.
[3:08:42.980 --> 3:08:47.420]  So take advantage of this introductory rate of 33% off
[3:08:47.420 --> 3:08:48.300]  caveman.
[3:08:48.300 --> 3:08:49.900]  You can get it for $40 right now.
[3:08:49.900 --> 3:08:52.580]  This is one of the best bone broth formulas out there
[3:08:52.580 --> 3:08:53.100]  right now.
[3:08:53.100 --> 3:08:57.500]  This is kind of a new trend, hitting the health people
[3:08:57.500 --> 3:09:01.060]  out there, hitting the weightlifting people out there.
[3:09:01.060 --> 3:09:02.580]  You can use this instead of protein
[3:09:02.580 --> 3:09:05.900]  if you want for your protein before or after a workout.
[3:09:05.900 --> 3:09:09.100]  But nonetheless, it has a lot more in there
[3:09:09.100 --> 3:09:11.060]  besides just the protein.
[3:09:11.060 --> 3:09:14.420]  You've got the shaga mushroom and you've got the bone broth,
[3:09:14.420 --> 3:09:16.620]  which of course most people probably don't get any
[3:09:16.620 --> 3:09:18.260]  of that into their systems.
[3:09:18.260 --> 3:09:20.500]  You can knock out all of that now with caveman.
[3:09:20.500 --> 3:09:22.460]  And again, 33% off.
[3:09:22.460 --> 3:09:25.300]  This is our latest breakthrough health product.
[3:09:25.300 --> 3:09:27.820]  There's some of the other, our TV viewers can see some
[3:09:27.820 --> 3:09:29.940]  of the other ingredients in there.
[3:09:29.940 --> 3:09:33.300]  And I also, I don't know how many hats we have left.
[3:09:33.300 --> 3:09:34.460]  Oh, there's some of the reviews.
[3:09:34.460 --> 3:09:36.420]  Wow, look at all those five star reviews.
[3:09:36.420 --> 3:09:37.980]  Pretty much the same with most of our products
[3:09:37.980 --> 3:09:40.060]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:09:40.060 --> 3:09:42.220]  I don't know how many of those hats we have left.
[3:09:42.220 --> 3:09:44.420]  The Make America Free, again, hats.
[3:09:44.420 --> 3:09:49.660]  I was out wearing it at the Trump rally, at the Trump march.
[3:09:49.660 --> 3:09:52.060]  Did you guys say we have any of those left?
[3:09:52.060 --> 3:09:53.020]  Oh, they are sold out.
[3:09:53.020 --> 3:09:53.780]  OK, no wonder.
[3:09:53.780 --> 3:09:55.300]  Yeah, people kept asking me about that hat.
[3:09:55.300 --> 3:09:57.660]  Well, nonetheless, we have plenty of other hats.
[3:09:57.660 --> 3:10:00.380]  Actually, that Moan Labe hat is a great hat.
[3:10:00.380 --> 3:10:02.260]  That 1776 hat is great too.
[3:10:02.260 --> 3:10:04.580]  People were asking me about the sticker I have in my laptop.
[3:10:04.580 --> 3:10:08.580]  You can get the 1776 hat, Moan Labe hat, come and take it hat.
[3:10:08.580 --> 3:10:11.060]  Check out all of our products, hats, t-shirts,
[3:10:11.060 --> 3:10:13.700]  Trump Pence 2020 shirt, nutraceuticals.
[3:10:13.700 --> 3:10:16.460]  We've got everything at infowarstore.com.
[3:10:16.460 --> 3:10:19.060]  And that's how you fund this operation
[3:10:19.060 --> 3:10:23.300]  and you help us go to the next level.
[3:10:23.300 --> 3:10:26.740]  So while we are going to the next level,
[3:10:26.740 --> 3:10:29.860]  thanks to you out there, the mainstream media
[3:10:29.860 --> 3:10:31.460]  is crashing and burning.
[3:10:31.460 --> 3:10:34.020]  Now, was it last week or two weeks ago,
[3:10:34.020 --> 3:10:38.260]  Mika Brzezinski basically is on air falling all over herself.
[3:10:38.260 --> 3:10:40.220]  She doesn't know what to do because she can't control
[3:10:40.220 --> 3:10:41.300]  the narrative anymore.
[3:10:41.300 --> 3:10:42.460]  She's literally freaking out.
[3:10:42.460 --> 3:10:44.100]  She's like, oh, my god.
[3:10:44.100 --> 3:10:46.100]  Donald Trump is controlling the narrative.
[3:10:46.100 --> 3:10:46.980]  That's our job.
[3:10:46.980 --> 3:10:48.500]  We're supposed to control the narrative.
[3:10:48.500 --> 3:10:49.980]  We don't have control anymore.
[3:10:49.980 --> 3:10:51.060]  We're not doing our jobs.
[3:10:51.060 --> 3:10:52.660]  Oh, my gosh.
[3:10:52.660 --> 3:10:56.540]  Well, it didn't stop for Mika Brzezinski.
[3:10:56.540 --> 3:10:59.700]  She was back on the air today.
[3:10:59.700 --> 3:11:03.980]  And well, she's just not feeling too confident right now.
[3:11:03.980 --> 3:11:05.140]  I can't blame her.
[3:11:05.140 --> 3:11:09.100]  Your role in society is becoming, well, pretty much,
[3:11:09.100 --> 3:11:11.220]  null and void, Mika.
[3:11:11.220 --> 3:11:13.940]  But she was on again today trying
[3:11:13.940 --> 3:11:16.940]  to talk about standing up for Obama and the claims
[3:11:16.940 --> 3:11:19.140]  that he was tapping Trump.
[3:11:19.140 --> 3:11:21.340]  But she got even a little more upset.
[3:11:21.340 --> 3:11:25.100]  But let's go ahead and go to Mika Brzezinski on air today
[3:11:25.100 --> 3:11:28.060]  trying to stand up for Obama and then falling all over herself
[3:11:28.060 --> 3:11:30.980]  because she doesn't know what to do.
[3:11:30.980 --> 3:11:33.180]  And when you were out speaking for President Trump,
[3:11:33.180 --> 3:11:35.620]  I would urge you not laugh at yourself.
[3:11:35.620 --> 3:11:37.580]  Because this is not funny.
[3:11:37.580 --> 3:11:39.620]  This is really bad.
[3:11:39.620 --> 3:11:42.900]  And just for the record, we're all really nervous.
[3:11:42.900 --> 3:11:45.580]  So if people out there feel nervous, we do too.
[3:11:45.580 --> 3:11:46.300]  We took you so long.
[3:11:46.300 --> 3:11:48.460]  We don't think this is funny.
[3:11:48.460 --> 3:11:50.460]  You don't think it's funny.
[3:11:50.460 --> 3:11:52.340]  I guess you thought it was funny when they were putting
[3:11:52.340 --> 3:11:53.300]  fluoride in the water.
[3:11:53.300 --> 3:11:55.100]  You thought it was funny when the national debt kept
[3:11:55.100 --> 3:11:56.340]  going up by the trillions.
[3:11:56.340 --> 3:11:57.300]  You thought all that was funny.
[3:11:57.300 --> 3:11:59.100]  You thought Fast and Furious was funny.
[3:11:59.100 --> 3:12:02.460]  You thought Obamacare was funny.
[3:12:02.460 --> 3:12:04.700]  You thought Laura Sillsby being connected to the Clintons
[3:12:04.700 --> 3:12:06.380]  was funny.
[3:12:06.380 --> 3:12:09.140]  You thought all the foreign donations that the Clintons took
[3:12:09.140 --> 3:12:11.020]  was funny.
[3:12:11.020 --> 3:12:12.020]  All that influence.
[3:12:12.020 --> 3:12:13.620]  You thought when she was in the State Department,
[3:12:13.620 --> 3:12:14.620]  you thought that was funny.
[3:12:14.620 --> 3:12:16.060]  You thought NAFTA and GATT was funny.
[3:12:16.060 --> 3:12:17.900]  You thought the Trans-Pacific Partnership was funny.
[3:12:17.900 --> 3:12:19.460]  You thought illegal immigration was funny.
[3:12:19.460 --> 3:12:21.100]  You thought not having a border was funny.
[3:12:21.100 --> 3:12:22.900]  But wait.
[3:12:22.900 --> 3:12:28.460]  Donald Trump gets in office, returns Americanism back.
[3:12:28.460 --> 3:12:35.100]  I mean, Donald Trump is literally like gas
[3:12:35.100 --> 3:12:39.580]  to the fire of American spirit, just pouring gas all over the
[3:12:39.580 --> 3:12:43.220]  fire that is the American spirit, just blowing it up,
[3:12:43.220 --> 3:12:47.220]  sending smoke screens throughout the entire world.
[3:12:47.220 --> 3:12:48.820]  And Mika Brzezinski is freaked out.
[3:12:48.820 --> 3:12:50.460]  You know why Mika Brzezinski is freaked out?
[3:12:50.460 --> 3:12:51.460]  She doesn't know what to do.
[3:12:51.460 --> 3:12:57.380]  Because her tiny little role of a rat in the United States
[3:12:57.380 --> 3:13:00.500]  media is coming to an end, and she knows it.
[3:13:00.500 --> 3:13:02.700]  So you know what, Mika, while you can sit here and act like
[3:13:02.700 --> 3:13:05.380]  you're all worried about a Donald Trump presidency,
[3:13:05.380 --> 3:13:06.860]  we know how fake you are.
[3:13:06.860 --> 3:13:09.460]  Because you never cared a damn about everything
[3:13:09.460 --> 3:13:13.020]  that was done to this country for the last decades.
[3:13:13.020 --> 3:13:15.820]  Mika Brzezinski, it's our job to control the news.
[3:13:15.820 --> 3:13:18.140]  It's our job to tell the American people what they think.
[3:13:18.140 --> 3:13:21.300]  Well, guess what, you're fired.
[3:13:21.300 --> 3:13:23.060]  Excuse me, I'm just sick of these people.
[3:13:23.060 --> 3:13:24.580]  I'm so ready to be done with them.
[3:13:24.580 --> 3:13:29.060]  Now, let's go back to the Trump-Russian claims.
[3:13:29.060 --> 3:13:35.180]  So Jason Sheffitz, who sometimes, to me, does great things
[3:13:35.180 --> 3:13:38.580]  and then other times just leaves me scratching my head,
[3:13:38.580 --> 3:13:40.220]  I think that maybe he tries to stay
[3:13:40.220 --> 3:13:41.420]  neutral on some of these issues.
[3:13:41.420 --> 3:13:42.900]  But Sheffitz comes out today.
[3:13:42.900 --> 3:13:46.420]  He's from Utah, Republican representative.
[3:13:46.420 --> 3:13:50.980]  And he says to CBS this morning that he has not seen anything
[3:13:50.980 --> 3:13:54.180]  directly that would support what the president has said
[3:13:54.180 --> 3:13:58.220]  as far as the wiretapping into his phone lines.
[3:13:58.220 --> 3:13:59.900]  Excuse me, Sheffitz.
[3:13:59.900 --> 3:14:02.900]  Are you aware of the NSA surveillance program?
[3:14:02.900 --> 3:14:05.860]  Again, they're wiretapping everybody, essentially.
[3:14:05.860 --> 3:14:08.020]  All they have to do is go get the data.
[3:14:08.020 --> 3:14:10.980]  They don't need to do the old system of wiretapping.
[3:14:10.980 --> 3:14:15.380]  They already have the NSA on all of our imperial probe droids.
[3:14:15.380 --> 3:14:16.740]  That's how it works.
[3:14:16.740 --> 3:14:19.540]  And all those little agreements that we signed to when
[3:14:19.540 --> 3:14:20.300]  we download the app.
[3:14:20.300 --> 3:14:21.500]  But I'm going off on a jack.
[3:14:21.500 --> 3:14:26.140]  So Sheffitz goes on and he says that Trump
[3:14:26.140 --> 3:14:28.580]  has tens of billions of dollars in intelligence
[3:14:28.580 --> 3:14:29.860]  at his fingertips.
[3:14:29.860 --> 3:14:32.300]  I got to believe I think he might have something there.
[3:14:32.300 --> 3:14:33.900]  But if not, we're going to find out.
[3:14:33.900 --> 3:14:36.500]  So basically what Sheffitz is insinuating here
[3:14:36.500 --> 3:14:42.540]  is that, look, Donald Trump has intelligence at his fingertips.
[3:14:42.540 --> 3:14:45.940]  He's got people in the know, and essentially there
[3:14:45.940 --> 3:14:48.980]  will be paper trails that he has access to.
[3:14:48.980 --> 3:14:52.900]  So he doesn't believe, and I feel the same,
[3:14:52.900 --> 3:14:56.020]  that Donald Trump would come out and make claims like this
[3:14:56.020 --> 3:14:58.860]  without any evidence at all.
[3:14:58.860 --> 3:15:01.420]  Of course, some of the evidence is already public.
[3:15:01.420 --> 3:15:05.260]  And what will happen here is Obama and the constituents
[3:15:05.260 --> 3:15:08.140]  of Obama in the media are going to play semantics.
[3:15:08.140 --> 3:15:10.500]  They're going to say, well, it wasn't Obama's order.
[3:15:10.500 --> 3:15:11.900]  Obama never signed an order.
[3:15:11.900 --> 3:15:13.980]  Obama never even knew.
[3:15:13.980 --> 3:15:15.700]  OK.
[3:15:15.700 --> 3:15:19.020]  So yeah, so this alphabet bureaucracy
[3:15:19.020 --> 3:15:23.220]  typed up the claim for a warrant or a wiretap.
[3:15:23.220 --> 3:15:25.980]  Then this alphabet bureaucracy reviewed it.
[3:15:25.980 --> 3:15:28.260]  Then this alphabet bureaucracy said it was OK.
[3:15:28.260 --> 3:15:30.300]  They passed over to this alphabet bureaucracy.
[3:15:30.300 --> 3:15:32.020]  And then, boom, they got all the surveillance.
[3:15:32.020 --> 3:15:34.820]  But magically, Obama had no idea because he didn't
[3:15:34.820 --> 3:15:36.060]  have to sign any of that off.
[3:15:36.060 --> 3:15:39.340]  It was just his alphabet bureaucracies that were doing it.
[3:15:39.340 --> 3:15:40.220]  You see how that works.
[3:15:40.220 --> 3:15:43.020]  So now, Obama can wipe his hands of the situation
[3:15:43.020 --> 3:15:44.460]  and say, oh, I had nothing to do with it,
[3:15:44.460 --> 3:15:46.940]  as he's going around vacationing all over America,
[3:15:46.940 --> 3:15:48.980]  setting up his bunker in Washington, DC
[3:15:48.980 --> 3:15:51.300]  to try to stop Donald Trump from making America great again.
[3:15:54.660 --> 3:15:57.660]  I mean, does Barack Obama just make you absolutely sick?
[3:16:00.340 --> 3:16:02.300]  I mean, what is this guy's problem, man?
[3:16:02.300 --> 3:16:02.820]  You're out.
[3:16:02.820 --> 3:16:03.380]  You're done.
[3:16:03.380 --> 3:16:04.900]  You've been repudiated, bro.
[3:16:04.900 --> 3:16:06.580]  Get out.
[3:16:06.580 --> 3:16:08.020]  Why are you still in Washington?
[3:16:08.020 --> 3:16:09.220]  Go on vacation.
[3:16:09.220 --> 3:16:10.260]  Go play golf.
[3:16:10.260 --> 3:16:11.780]  That's what you did when you were president.
[3:16:11.780 --> 3:16:13.220]  Why don't you do it now?
[3:16:13.220 --> 3:16:15.340]  Get out of our lives.
[3:16:15.340 --> 3:16:15.940]  I'm sorry.
[3:16:15.940 --> 3:16:17.220]  I don't mean to be yelling at you.
[3:16:17.220 --> 3:16:19.980]  It's just this.
[3:16:19.980 --> 3:16:22.340]  You knew this was going to happen, though.
[3:16:22.340 --> 3:16:26.180]  The minute America decided to take its power back,
[3:16:26.180 --> 3:16:28.540]  the minute America decided to make America great again,
[3:16:28.540 --> 3:16:31.500]  the minute America decided to take its destiny back,
[3:16:31.500 --> 3:16:34.700]  of course, the Barack Obamas in the political establishment
[3:16:34.700 --> 3:16:36.540]  were going to do everything they could to stop it.
[3:16:36.540 --> 3:16:39.340]  They hate this country.
[3:16:39.340 --> 3:16:41.340]  So of course, they're going to try to stop it.
[3:16:41.340 --> 3:16:43.900]  Mika Brzezinski, we control the news.
[3:16:43.900 --> 3:16:46.620]  In fact, now that we don't control the news, we're worried.
[3:16:46.620 --> 3:16:48.620]  We don't know what to do.
[3:16:48.620 --> 3:16:50.300]  Oh my gosh, I'm Mika Brzezinski.
[3:16:50.300 --> 3:16:53.740]  I might be out of a job.
[3:16:53.740 --> 3:16:55.780]  Yeah, you should be out of a job.
[3:16:55.780 --> 3:16:59.180]  But then again, you admitted what your job was, didn't you?
[3:16:59.180 --> 3:17:00.780]  You're supposed to control the narrative.
[3:17:00.780 --> 3:17:03.820]  You're supposed to control what the American people
[3:17:03.820 --> 3:17:05.940]  see in the news.
[3:17:05.940 --> 3:17:10.340]  And of course, it comes with your nice little spin, doesn't it?
[3:17:10.340 --> 3:17:13.540]  You know, let's talk about this real quick
[3:17:13.540 --> 3:17:15.420]  before we go to break.
[3:17:15.420 --> 3:17:19.500]  But again, folks, the evidence already
[3:17:19.500 --> 3:17:22.900]  exists that Barack Obama was, quote unquote,
[3:17:22.900 --> 3:17:25.900]  wiretapping Donald Trump or Trump Tower.
[3:17:25.900 --> 3:17:28.060]  We already know that they got the leaks with Mike Flynn.
[3:17:28.060 --> 3:17:29.940]  We already know that the NSA is spying on everything.
[3:17:29.940 --> 3:17:31.540]  We already know that they were investigating
[3:17:31.540 --> 3:17:32.340]  Trump's ties to Russia.
[3:17:32.340 --> 3:17:34.340]  We already know they were looking for Russian banks
[3:17:34.340 --> 3:17:35.340]  involved with Donald Trump.
[3:17:35.340 --> 3:17:36.300]  So this is absurd.
[3:17:36.300 --> 3:17:38.860]  Really, you're going to tell me that you're going through all
[3:17:38.860 --> 3:17:44.780]  of that and you're not going to tap his phones?
[3:17:44.780 --> 3:17:48.420]  Something tells me you're either lying or incompetent.
[3:17:48.420 --> 3:17:50.580]  Because if you're investigating the Russian ties
[3:17:50.580 --> 3:17:53.100]  and you think Trump is seriously Russian,
[3:17:53.100 --> 3:17:56.100]  talking to Russian diplomats and bankers all the time,
[3:17:56.100 --> 3:17:57.620]  how are you going to know that unless you're
[3:17:57.620 --> 3:18:00.540]  checking the phone records?
[3:18:00.540 --> 3:18:02.940]  Doesn't make much sense to me.
[3:18:02.940 --> 3:18:06.420]  Now here's an interesting thing that maybe will continue
[3:18:06.420 --> 3:18:07.260]  to develop.
[3:18:07.260 --> 3:18:11.020]  Pentagon leaves open possibility of more North Korea launch
[3:18:11.020 --> 3:18:12.420]  attempts.
[3:18:12.420 --> 3:18:14.740]  So North Korea continues to launch
[3:18:14.740 --> 3:18:16.940]  all of these missiles, different weapons tests,
[3:18:16.940 --> 3:18:19.100]  threatening the West, threatening China, threatening
[3:18:19.100 --> 3:18:21.380]  South Korea, threatening everybody, just out of control
[3:18:21.380 --> 3:18:22.820]  what's going on.
[3:18:22.820 --> 3:18:27.620]  But it's now reached a new sense of,
[3:18:27.620 --> 3:18:29.300]  I don't know, awareness is the right word,
[3:18:29.300 --> 3:18:33.220]  but worry as Japan moves to highest alert level
[3:18:33.220 --> 3:18:35.820]  after North Korea test fires missiles.
[3:18:35.820 --> 3:18:39.220]  So now Japan, a strong ally of the United States,
[3:18:39.220 --> 3:18:42.140]  a strong ally of Donald Trump, they
[3:18:42.140 --> 3:18:44.820]  are worried about North Korea.
[3:18:44.820 --> 3:18:45.460]  It goes on.
[3:18:45.460 --> 3:18:49.580]  Kremlin says it's seriously worried about North Korea
[3:18:49.580 --> 3:18:51.340]  missile drills.
[3:18:51.340 --> 3:18:55.300]  Is there any debate about what's going on in North Korea?
[3:18:55.300 --> 3:19:01.660]  Is it not mutually understood across the planet
[3:19:01.660 --> 3:19:07.260]  that North Korea is in a serious state of a tyrannical
[3:19:07.260 --> 3:19:11.380]  dictatorship and communism that is robbing
[3:19:11.380 --> 3:19:15.140]  the basic foundations of wealth and prosperity
[3:19:15.140 --> 3:19:18.420]  from the people of North Korea being stolen
[3:19:18.420 --> 3:19:21.060]  by the communist dictators?
[3:19:21.060 --> 3:19:22.540]  Is that debated anywhere?
[3:19:22.540 --> 3:19:26.140]  Why can't we get a worldwide effort
[3:19:26.140 --> 3:19:28.020]  to free the people of North Korea?
[3:19:28.020 --> 3:19:29.420]  We've got NATO.
[3:19:29.420 --> 3:19:31.020]  We've got the UN.
[3:19:31.020 --> 3:19:33.340]  What are you doing?
[3:19:33.340 --> 3:19:34.620]  Isn't that your job?
[3:19:34.620 --> 3:19:36.580]  Aren't you supposed to be the peacekeepers?
[3:19:36.580 --> 3:19:38.620]  Aren't you supposed to be standing up for humanity?
[3:19:38.620 --> 3:19:39.580]  NATO?
[3:19:39.580 --> 3:19:40.660]  UN?
[3:19:40.660 --> 3:19:43.980]  What about the people in North Korea?
[3:19:43.980 --> 3:19:45.220]  So we'll see if Donald Trump wants
[3:19:45.220 --> 3:19:47.220]  to do anything to help the people of North Korea that
[3:19:47.220 --> 3:19:49.740]  have been ignored, but it seems like worldwide people
[3:19:49.740 --> 3:19:50.700]  are getting more worried.
[3:19:50.700 --> 3:19:52.500]  Owen Schreuer filling in for the Alex Jones show.
[3:19:52.500 --> 3:19:55.460]  We're going to take your calls in about 10 minutes.
[3:19:55.460 --> 3:19:56.060]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:19:59.940 --> 3:20:02.860]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's.
[3:20:02.860 --> 3:20:05.540]  In an epic battle of David versus Goliath,
[3:20:05.540 --> 3:20:07.940]  in the early 1980s, a child was born.
[3:20:07.940 --> 3:20:08.860]  Two of them, actually.
[3:20:08.860 --> 3:20:10.940]  Their names were Jeff and Andy.
[3:20:10.940 --> 3:20:11.980]  Time went by.
[3:20:11.980 --> 3:20:13.340]  They developed facial hair.
[3:20:13.340 --> 3:20:15.300]  And one day, something happened.
[3:20:15.300 --> 3:20:17.900]  Andy got ripped off by overpriced razors.
[3:20:17.900 --> 3:20:19.980]  So they decided to start their own shaving company
[3:20:19.980 --> 3:20:21.940]  and fix shaving once and for all.
[3:20:21.940 --> 3:20:23.460]  They hired the best designers.
[3:20:23.460 --> 3:20:26.220]  They bought a 95-year-old German blade factory.
[3:20:26.220 --> 3:20:28.500]  And they started selling high-quality razors online,
[3:20:28.500 --> 3:20:30.860]  with no upcharging direct to customers.
[3:20:30.860 --> 3:20:32.300]  How did the overpriced razor company
[3:20:32.300 --> 3:20:33.180]  respond?
[3:20:33.180 --> 3:20:35.420]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[3:20:35.420 --> 3:20:37.700]  Don't worry, Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants
[3:20:37.700 --> 3:20:40.220]  and a relentless dream to get all guys a great shave
[3:20:40.220 --> 3:20:41.580]  at a great price.

[3:20:59.580 --> 3:21:00.740]  Attention, investors.
[3:21:00.740 --> 3:21:02.460]  2017 is the year of Trump.
[3:21:02.460 --> 3:21:05.260]  And financial markets are rising at all time highs.
[3:21:05.260 --> 3:21:09.220]  But economic uncertainty may be greater than after any election
[3:21:09.220 --> 3:21:10.180]  in our lifetime.
[3:21:10.180 --> 3:21:11.820]  And as retirement approaches, there's
[3:21:11.820 --> 3:21:13.900]  little time to recover your losses.
[3:21:13.900 --> 3:21:16.180]  You need to hedge against uncertainty.
[3:21:16.180 --> 3:21:18.300]  That means transferring part of your retirement
[3:21:18.300 --> 3:21:20.020]  to physical gold and silver stored
[3:21:20.020 --> 3:21:21.740]  where you can actually hold it in your hand
[3:21:21.740 --> 3:21:24.180]  and get it fast in any disaster.
[3:21:24.180 --> 3:21:25.620]  It's a perfect time to buy.
[3:21:25.620 --> 3:21:28.100]  Prices are low and expected to climb.

[3:22:04.820 --> 3:22:07.020]  and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns,
[3:22:07.020 --> 3:22:10.180]  blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[3:22:10.180 --> 3:22:12.100]  There's something that is changing thousands
[3:22:12.100 --> 3:22:13.060]  of people's lives.
[3:22:13.060 --> 3:22:14.300]  And you could be one of them.
[3:22:14.300 --> 3:22:16.420]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[3:22:16.420 --> 3:22:19.260]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract,
[3:22:19.260 --> 3:22:22.060]  talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[3:22:22.060 --> 3:22:24.780]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract
[3:22:24.780 --> 3:22:27.220]  is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins,
[3:22:27.220 --> 3:22:30.340]  minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients
[3:22:30.340 --> 3:22:32.020]  so the body will heal itself.
[3:22:32.020 --> 3:22:34.020]  And yes, the body does have the ability

[3:24:42.340 --> 3:24:44.500]  that we're sending out today, but the point is,

[3:25:08.180 --> 3:25:13.460]  You know, there's a lot of measuring sticks right now
[3:25:13.460 --> 3:25:20.260]  on not just American society, but the world society as a whole.
[3:25:20.260 --> 3:25:22.180]  You can kind of look at TV ratings.
[3:25:22.180 --> 3:25:24.860]  You can look at social media engagement.
[3:25:24.860 --> 3:25:26.780]  You can look at things in the three-dimensional world,
[3:25:26.780 --> 3:25:28.540]  like who shows up at Trump events,
[3:25:28.540 --> 3:25:31.820]  who shows up to protest Trump events.
[3:25:31.820 --> 3:25:34.260]  Where is the pop culture going?
[3:25:34.260 --> 3:25:36.860]  Where is the pop culture moving?
[3:25:36.860 --> 3:25:39.500]  And then you take a look at someone like Joy Villa,
[3:25:39.500 --> 3:25:42.620]  and you look at how she's just blown up.
[3:25:42.620 --> 3:25:44.620]  I mean, Joy Villa, who's her to her?
[3:25:44.620 --> 3:25:50.420]  Before she did her Make America Great Again stunt, nobody.
[3:25:50.420 --> 3:25:53.700]  Now she's practically a household name.
[3:25:53.700 --> 3:25:57.460]  That is a measuring stick for where society is going.
[3:25:57.460 --> 3:25:59.340]  And I think there's another one right here.
[3:25:59.340 --> 3:26:04.340]  ESPN lays off hit on-camera personality.
[3:26:04.340 --> 3:26:08.300]  So basically, the story here is ESPN's ratings are dying.
[3:26:08.300 --> 3:26:09.740]  They're not making enough money,
[3:26:09.740 --> 3:26:11.660]  and they're going to have to start firing
[3:26:11.660 --> 3:26:14.180]  some of their on-camera personalities.
[3:26:14.180 --> 3:26:17.220]  They've already had to shrink their operation a lot,
[3:26:17.220 --> 3:26:18.940]  but apparently it wasn't enough.
[3:26:18.940 --> 3:26:20.660]  And I'm not sitting here trying to hate on ESPN.
[3:26:20.660 --> 3:26:22.500]  I got plenty of things I could bash ESPN for.
[3:26:22.500 --> 3:26:25.020]  In fact, that's not here or there.
[3:26:25.020 --> 3:26:28.820]  The point is, what you're seeing now
[3:26:28.820 --> 3:26:33.500]  is that the American public are no longer fixated
[3:26:33.500 --> 3:26:36.020]  with ESPN all day long.
[3:26:36.020 --> 3:26:38.420]  That's what it comes down to.
[3:26:38.420 --> 3:26:41.860]  And of course, ESPN doesn't like the fact
[3:26:41.860 --> 3:26:45.100]  that you're not obsessed with sports 24-7 anymore,
[3:26:45.100 --> 3:26:48.940]  but that's probably good for our country.
[3:26:48.940 --> 3:26:50.860]  And I think that this story about ESPN,
[3:26:50.860 --> 3:26:53.260]  and you can see other stories, NFL ratings were down.
[3:26:53.260 --> 3:26:55.100]  That might have something to do with the Colin Kaepernick
[3:26:55.100 --> 3:26:56.340]  of the world.
[3:26:56.340 --> 3:27:00.700]  But I think that right now, what you're seeing is a mass.
[3:27:00.700 --> 3:27:03.140]  And it's not even that people don't like ESPN anymore,
[3:27:03.140 --> 3:27:04.860]  or people don't like football anymore.
[3:27:04.860 --> 3:27:08.380]  It's that they realize now how serious
[3:27:08.380 --> 3:27:10.260]  the Civil War is for the future of this country.
[3:27:10.260 --> 3:27:12.300]  It's now in their face, in their living room,
[3:27:12.300 --> 3:27:15.820]  in their life, and they know they have to fight.
[3:27:15.820 --> 3:27:18.180]  And that's why so many people have focused their energy now
[3:27:18.180 --> 3:27:21.700]  back to raising their family right, working harder,
[3:27:21.700 --> 3:27:24.500]  and doing whatever they have to do to ensure
[3:27:24.500 --> 3:27:27.900]  the future of this country for their lineage.
[3:27:27.900 --> 3:27:33.660]  Now real quick, again, going back to the Trump and Obama feud,
[3:27:33.660 --> 3:27:35.940]  ex-CIA director on wiretap claim,
[3:27:35.940 --> 3:27:38.940]  Trump apparently forgot that he was president.
[3:27:38.940 --> 3:27:42.660]  Now this comes from an interview that was on Fox News
[3:27:42.660 --> 3:27:45.940]  where Michael Hayden, who's been a critic of Trump,
[3:27:45.940 --> 3:27:49.460]  basically is saying, hey, Donald, you're the president.
[3:27:49.460 --> 3:27:50.780]  You can pull all the strings.
[3:27:50.780 --> 3:27:52.060]  You can get all the records.
[3:27:52.060 --> 3:27:54.500]  You have access to all of this.
[3:27:54.500 --> 3:27:55.820]  Of course, it goes farther than that.
[3:27:55.820 --> 3:27:58.780]  He could probably fire some of these dullers
[3:27:58.780 --> 3:27:59.980]  that he's having to deal with.
[3:27:59.980 --> 3:28:04.100]  But insinuating, hey, Donald, you've got the power.
[3:28:04.100 --> 3:28:05.180]  Why don't you just expose it?
[3:28:05.180 --> 3:28:08.500]  Why don't you get down to the actual paperwork,
[3:28:08.500 --> 3:28:09.540]  show the orders?
[3:28:09.540 --> 3:28:10.740]  Of course, we already have the orders.
[3:28:10.740 --> 3:28:13.660]  We already know this is going on.
[3:28:13.660 --> 3:28:16.340]  But it's an interesting call to action
[3:28:16.340 --> 3:28:17.500]  from the ex-CIA director.
[3:28:17.500 --> 3:28:19.580]  Now we've had different points of view
[3:28:19.580 --> 3:28:23.660]  coming from all across the platform here.
[3:28:23.660 --> 3:28:24.660]  Trump needs to do this.
[3:28:24.660 --> 3:28:25.700]  Trump needs to do that.
[3:28:25.700 --> 3:28:26.700]  He can't do this.
[3:28:26.700 --> 3:28:28.340]  He shouldn't do that.
[3:28:28.340 --> 3:28:29.260]  He never did that.
[3:28:29.260 --> 3:28:30.180]  Obama did this.
[3:28:30.180 --> 3:28:31.820]  Obama never did that.
[3:28:31.820 --> 3:28:33.340]  We've seen the Mario go around.
[3:28:33.340 --> 3:28:38.020]  But what it comes down to at the end of the day, again,
[3:28:38.020 --> 3:28:42.060]  this is all an effort to bring down Trump's presidency, which
[3:28:42.060 --> 3:28:44.020]  is not just Trump's presidency.
[3:28:44.020 --> 3:28:46.980]  It's you, the people that elected him.
[3:28:46.980 --> 3:28:50.300]  It's the Republic taking control of this nation back.
[3:28:50.300 --> 3:28:52.540]  See, the power players can't give you this country back,
[3:28:52.540 --> 3:28:53.620]  can they?
[3:28:53.620 --> 3:28:56.860]  No, because their future depends on themselves holding
[3:28:56.860 --> 3:29:00.940]  power as they've had.
[3:29:00.940 --> 3:29:02.100]  All right, well, you know what?
[3:29:02.100 --> 3:29:05.020]  We're going to open up the phone lines in the next segment.
[3:29:05.020 --> 3:29:06.820]  So let's go ahead and give that phone number out.
[3:29:06.820 --> 3:29:10.260]  800-259-9231.
[3:29:10.260 --> 3:29:13.060]  Where do you think it goes from here?
[3:29:13.060 --> 3:29:16.660]  Can Trump really beat the establishment
[3:29:16.660 --> 3:29:18.780]  throwing everything they can at him?
[3:29:18.780 --> 3:29:20.260]  They're throwing the kitchen sink at him.
[3:29:20.260 --> 3:29:21.780]  They're throwing the car muffler at him.
[3:29:21.780 --> 3:29:23.260]  They're throwing kids at him.
[3:29:23.260 --> 3:29:24.660]  They're throwing everything at him.
[3:29:24.660 --> 3:29:26.980]  They're putting their kids out on the street with signs.
[3:29:26.980 --> 3:29:28.860]  Some of these kids might not be able to read or write,
[3:29:28.860 --> 3:29:31.540]  but they got a sign that's anti-Trump thanks to their parents
[3:29:31.540 --> 3:29:33.420]  politicizing their own children.
[3:29:33.420 --> 3:29:35.300]  Can Donald Trump defeat this?
[3:29:35.300 --> 3:29:36.740]  Can we actually defeat this?
[3:29:36.740 --> 3:29:42.460]  Can Donald Trump defeat this? Can we actually stop this?
[3:29:42.460 --> 3:29:44.460]  The overthrow of the Republic.
[3:29:44.460 --> 3:29:45.940]  Your phone calls on the other side.
[3:29:45.940 --> 3:29:47.660]  Owen Schreuer sitting in for Alex Jones.
[3:29:47.660 --> 3:29:49.020]  Fourth Hour Alex Jones Show.
[3:29:49.020 --> 3:29:50.300]  InfowarsStore.com, folks.
[3:29:50.300 --> 3:29:51.300]  Support this broadcast.
[3:29:51.300 --> 3:29:53.140]  The end buyers on the run.
[3:29:53.140 --> 3:29:55.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:59.900 --> 3:30:02.580]  The TSA is not satisfied with their current pat-down
[3:30:02.580 --> 3:30:05.580]  procedure, so they are ramping them up to get more invasive.
[3:30:05.580 --> 3:30:07.980]  This is in response to a study that found weapons
[3:30:07.980 --> 3:30:09.460]  making it past security.
[3:30:09.460 --> 3:30:13.140]  The new pat-down will be, quote, more intimate than before.
[3:30:13.140 --> 3:30:15.340]  While TSA screenings are clearly fallible,
[3:30:15.340 --> 3:30:17.140]  this new loving pat-down procedure
[3:30:17.140 --> 3:30:18.660]  will make it less appealing for people
[3:30:18.660 --> 3:30:21.780]  who want to bypass the radiation scanners for health concerns,
[3:30:21.780 --> 3:30:24.540]  so they will just capitulate to the body scanners, which I'm
[3:30:24.540 --> 3:30:27.340]  sure will be ramped up and more intimate soon as well.
[3:30:27.340 --> 3:30:30.060]  Keep in mind, this applies to the random pat-down,
[3:30:30.060 --> 3:30:33.100]  so this loose net is hardly an effective strategy
[3:30:33.100 --> 3:30:35.780]  unless you're looking to give more TSA agents freedom
[3:30:35.780 --> 3:30:37.300]  to grope your wife's chest.
[3:30:37.300 --> 3:30:39.260]  For the first time in human history,
[3:30:39.260 --> 3:30:42.020]  CNN's Angela Rye is right about something.
[3:30:42.020 --> 3:30:44.580]  As she wrote a piece titled, Dear TSA,
[3:30:44.580 --> 3:30:47.380]  the country is not safer after you grab vaginas,
[3:30:47.380 --> 3:30:49.540]  after an experience she had with the TSA.
[3:30:49.540 --> 3:30:51.500]  And that was before the new policy.
[3:30:51.500 --> 3:30:54.580]  Let's all unite behind molestation-free air travel
[3:30:54.580 --> 3:30:55.300]  for all.
[3:30:55.300 --> 3:30:56.860]  Make flying great again.
[3:30:56.860 --> 3:30:59.660]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[3:30:59.660 --> 3:31:01.540]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[3:31:01.540 --> 3:31:03.540]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[3:31:03.540 --> 3:31:06.460]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[3:31:06.460 --> 3:31:09.340]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals,
[3:31:09.340 --> 3:31:12.540]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[3:31:12.540 --> 3:31:14.900]  The same team based right here in America
[3:31:14.900 --> 3:31:17.900]  that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water
[3:31:17.900 --> 3:31:21.740]  Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[3:31:21.740 --> 3:31:24.220]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself,
[3:31:24.220 --> 3:31:26.820]  your coworkers, your family, your children,
[3:31:26.820 --> 3:31:29.260]  to the best job you can to purify your air.
[3:31:29.260 --> 3:31:31.940]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[3:31:31.940 --> 3:31:35.180]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid
[3:31:35.180 --> 3:31:37.300]  most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[3:31:37.300 --> 3:31:39.460]  The general public doesn't.
[3:31:39.460 --> 3:31:42.100]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300,
[3:31:42.100 --> 3:31:43.300]  $400, $500.
[3:31:43.300 --> 3:31:45.980]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet
[3:31:45.980 --> 3:31:46.940]  incredibly clean.
[3:31:46.940 --> 3:31:48.740]  This is a system I'm personally putting in
[3:31:48.740 --> 3:31:51.660]  throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters
[3:31:51.660 --> 3:31:53.660]  that didn't do as good a job.
[3:31:53.660 --> 3:31:56.660]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.
[3:31:56.660 --> 3:32:00.580]  And then fullwarstore.com.
[3:32:00.580 --> 3:32:02.100]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:32:02.100 --> 3:32:04.780]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money
[3:32:04.780 --> 3:32:08.060]  on one of the best new off the grid products of 2017.
[3:32:08.060 --> 3:32:09.620]  And seriously, I really think everyone
[3:32:09.620 --> 3:32:10.580]  should have one of these.
[3:32:10.580 --> 3:32:13.020]  I'm talking about the PPX Solar Generator System
[3:32:13.020 --> 3:32:14.820]  from our friends at Solutions from Science,
[3:32:14.820 --> 3:32:16.420]  one of our oldest sponsors.
[3:32:16.420 --> 3:32:18.900]  The PPX is so small, you can put it in your pocket.
[3:32:18.900 --> 3:32:21.700]  But so powerful, you can run some 110 appliances
[3:32:21.700 --> 3:32:23.740]  at your house, like a small refrigerator,
[3:32:23.740 --> 3:32:25.500]  so you can keep food from spoiling.
[3:32:25.500 --> 3:32:27.740]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars,
[3:32:27.740 --> 3:32:31.100]  trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[3:32:31.100 --> 3:32:32.620]  The system provides an endless supply
[3:32:32.620 --> 3:32:33.900]  of off the grid electricity,
[3:32:33.900 --> 3:32:36.300]  allowing you to create your own private power grid,
[3:32:36.300 --> 3:32:38.100]  literally anywhere in the world.
[3:32:38.100 --> 3:32:40.420]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations,
[3:32:40.420 --> 3:32:42.940]  any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[3:32:42.940 --> 3:32:46.260]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[3:32:46.260 --> 3:32:48.260]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[3:32:48.260 --> 3:32:51.340]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout
[3:32:51.340 --> 3:32:54.020]  and get a second PPX Energy Unit for free.
[3:32:54.020 --> 3:32:56.500]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[3:32:56.500 --> 3:32:58.500]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[3:33:00.500 --> 3:33:03.500]  ["Private Power Grid"]
[3:33:08.420 --> 3:33:12.340]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios,
[3:33:12.340 --> 3:33:15.420]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:15.420 --> 3:33:19.140]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[3:33:19.140 --> 3:33:24.140]  ["Private Power Grid"]
[3:33:26.140 --> 3:33:28.420]  Folks, InfoWars is exploding right now.
[3:33:28.420 --> 3:33:30.740]  This place is seriously alive today.
[3:33:30.740 --> 3:33:35.180]  And Alex is ready to launch this place to the next level.
[3:33:35.180 --> 3:33:37.100]  But he's very smart, he's very meticulous,
[3:33:37.100 --> 3:33:38.780]  he makes sure that he does everything the right way
[3:33:38.780 --> 3:33:39.900]  at the right time.
[3:33:39.900 --> 3:33:42.620]  And your funding is going to take this place
[3:33:42.620 --> 3:33:44.780]  to the next level, and you have come through.
[3:33:44.780 --> 3:33:46.620]  And I don't think you're going to be upset
[3:33:46.620 --> 3:33:48.380]  with the plans that Alex Jones has for this place.
[3:33:48.380 --> 3:33:50.140]  So thank you guys so much for all your support.
[3:33:50.140 --> 3:33:53.580]  InfoWarsStore.com is one way to support us.
[3:33:53.580 --> 3:33:55.220]  I'm about to take your phone calls.
[3:33:55.220 --> 3:33:58.340]  The Dalai Lama says Chinese hardliners
[3:33:58.340 --> 3:34:00.060]  have parts of their brain missing.
[3:34:00.060 --> 3:34:02.860]  He starts talking about how the Chinese political establishment
[3:34:02.860 --> 3:34:05.460]  is basically just, they're not acting right,
[3:34:05.460 --> 3:34:07.060]  they're not acting with common sense,
[3:34:07.060 --> 3:34:08.780]  and it upsets them very much.
[3:34:08.780 --> 3:34:13.140]  And you know what, I think I agree with the Dalai Lama here.
[3:34:13.140 --> 3:34:16.060]  And I would say that, you know what?
[3:34:16.060 --> 3:34:19.220]  Lama, sir, you could probably say the same thing
[3:34:19.220 --> 3:34:21.620]  about a lot of the leadership across the planet.
[3:34:22.660 --> 3:34:25.420]  And that's how we've ended up in this mess
[3:34:25.420 --> 3:34:29.740]  with the golden toad steering the ship of freedom,
[3:34:30.700 --> 3:34:34.140]  hopefully into the future for prosperity.
[3:34:34.140 --> 3:34:37.860]  So let's go out to some InfoWars fans that have called in.
[3:34:37.860 --> 3:34:38.900]  I love hearing from you guys.
[3:34:38.900 --> 3:34:42.020]  Let's start with Anna Marie in Pennsylvania.
[3:34:42.020 --> 3:34:43.260]  Go ahead, Anna.
[3:34:43.260 --> 3:34:44.780]  Hi, Ellen.
[3:34:44.780 --> 3:34:45.820]  Hello, how are you?
[3:34:45.820 --> 3:34:47.140]  Hi, I'm great.
[3:34:47.140 --> 3:34:50.940]  I have an amazing way for Alex to make
[3:34:50.940 --> 3:34:53.740]  an amazing amount of money for InfoWars.
[3:34:53.740 --> 3:34:56.860]  And I can't believe that it's not in his store.
[3:34:56.860 --> 3:34:59.460]  You know, bumper stickers are kind of sketchy now.
[3:34:59.460 --> 3:35:01.860]  People will destroy your car, flatten your tires,
[3:35:01.860 --> 3:35:02.700]  and things like that.
[3:35:02.700 --> 3:35:05.700]  Well, you mean, oh, the tolerant left, the peaceful left?
[3:35:05.700 --> 3:35:07.980]  Yes, yeah, those very people.
[3:35:08.900 --> 3:35:10.420]  But I have a great idea.
[3:35:10.420 --> 3:35:13.620]  I don't know why Alex doesn't get car magnets.
[3:35:13.620 --> 3:35:15.940]  You can, as long as the car is moving, the magnets
[3:35:15.940 --> 3:35:18.540]  on your car, when you park it, you take it off.
[3:35:18.540 --> 3:35:20.860]  Or when it's in your driveway home,
[3:35:20.860 --> 3:35:22.860]  you know, you take it off or whatever,
[3:35:22.860 --> 3:35:24.660]  when you don't want someone to see it.
[3:35:24.660 --> 3:35:25.500]  I have a magnet on my car.
[3:35:25.500 --> 3:35:26.500]  And when you know what your car to get keyed
[3:35:26.500 --> 3:35:27.700]  or your tires to get slashed,
[3:35:27.700 --> 3:35:29.860]  you just pop the magnet off, okay.
[3:35:29.860 --> 3:35:33.380]  Yes, yes, and I have one on my car now, Trump 2020.
[3:35:33.380 --> 3:35:37.180]  And anytime, you know, people get in their cars every day.
[3:35:37.180 --> 3:35:38.020]  Right?
[3:35:38.020 --> 3:35:38.860]  Yeah, no.
[3:35:40.220 --> 3:35:42.940]  People get in their cars every day and they ride around
[3:35:42.940 --> 3:35:46.340]  and I mean, t-shirts are good, but you gotta wash them.
[3:35:46.340 --> 3:35:47.500]  And you can't wear them every day.
[3:35:47.500 --> 3:35:48.900]  People will think, you know, what's wrong with him?
[3:35:48.900 --> 3:35:50.140]  We're in the same t-shirt every day.
[3:35:50.140 --> 3:35:52.460]  But you get in your car every day
[3:35:52.460 --> 3:35:54.460]  and you have this on your car, people see it,
[3:35:54.460 --> 3:35:55.980]  they'll stop behind you at a light
[3:35:55.980 --> 3:35:58.540]  or at a stop sign and there they see it.
[3:35:58.540 --> 3:36:00.940]  So he could do some Info Wars car magnets.
[3:36:00.940 --> 3:36:01.860]  I think that would be great.
[3:36:01.860 --> 3:36:03.500]  They're inexpensive and he would sell like
[3:36:03.500 --> 3:36:05.260]  billions of them probably.
[3:36:05.260 --> 3:36:06.940]  Well, I don't know about billions.
[3:36:06.940 --> 3:36:08.940]  That would be nice if we get billions sold.
[3:36:08.940 --> 3:36:11.100]  I don't think we'd ever need another dime of funding.
[3:36:11.100 --> 3:36:12.820]  But thank you for that idea, Anna Marie.
[3:36:12.820 --> 3:36:13.860]  That's interesting.
[3:36:13.860 --> 3:36:16.860]  Yeah, because, you know, I don't, I'll be honest.
[3:36:16.860 --> 3:36:19.620]  I mean, I don't wanna put a bunch of Trump swag on my car
[3:36:19.620 --> 3:36:22.740]  because I fear that, yeah, my tires will get slashed.
[3:36:22.740 --> 3:36:24.620]  Maybe somebody takes a hammer to the window
[3:36:24.620 --> 3:36:27.460]  or throws a rock through it or something.
[3:36:27.460 --> 3:36:29.580]  But, you know, obviously the magnet idea is interesting.
[3:36:29.580 --> 3:36:31.020]  Even, you know, and that's the other thing too.
[3:36:31.020 --> 3:36:32.740]  You know what though?
[3:36:32.740 --> 3:36:34.660]  When I see cars out on the road
[3:36:34.660 --> 3:36:36.380]  that put the Trump sticker on the car
[3:36:36.380 --> 3:36:40.020]  or when I see people in public that have their Trump gear on,
[3:36:40.020 --> 3:36:42.540]  I make sure to salute them.
[3:36:42.540 --> 3:36:46.580]  I make sure to say, hey, thank you for being brave enough.
[3:36:46.580 --> 3:36:48.860]  Thank you for showing your courage out here
[3:36:48.860 --> 3:36:49.860]  and for standing up for Trump.
[3:36:49.860 --> 3:36:51.900]  Because it's not easy, folks.
[3:36:51.900 --> 3:36:52.820]  It's not easy.
[3:36:52.820 --> 3:36:53.900]  And I'm not gonna sit here
[3:36:53.900 --> 3:36:56.460]  and compare Trump supporters to the likes of, you know,
[3:36:56.460 --> 3:36:58.540]  Rosa Parks or Martin Luther King,
[3:36:58.540 --> 3:36:59.820]  obviously different times.
[3:36:59.820 --> 3:37:04.460]  But the overarching kind of story is the same.
[3:37:04.460 --> 3:37:07.500]  Where, yeah, if you go out and you're Trump gear,
[3:37:07.500 --> 3:37:09.140]  you're probably gonna get hated on.
[3:37:09.140 --> 3:37:11.780]  You're probably gonna get looked at funny.
[3:37:11.780 --> 3:37:13.700]  You know, it's not reached the point
[3:37:13.700 --> 3:37:14.860]  where you're just gonna get screamed at
[3:37:14.860 --> 3:37:16.300]  and kicked out of establishments yet.
[3:37:16.300 --> 3:37:19.300]  But in some cases, it has gotten to that point.
[3:37:19.300 --> 3:37:23.140]  So anybody out there who wears their Trump gear out,
[3:37:23.140 --> 3:37:24.660]  I just salute you.
[3:37:24.660 --> 3:37:26.460]  You are truly courageous.
[3:37:27.460 --> 3:37:29.260]  Don't sit here and say, oh, look at Alex,
[3:37:29.260 --> 3:37:31.260]  how courageous he is or how courageous you are, Owen.
[3:37:31.260 --> 3:37:32.780]  When you go out and you talk to these people
[3:37:32.780 --> 3:37:33.620]  at the Trump protest.
[3:37:33.620 --> 3:37:35.980]  No, the moment that you go outside
[3:37:35.980 --> 3:37:37.380]  and publicly support Donald Trump,
[3:37:37.380 --> 3:37:38.700]  you are just as courageous.
[3:37:38.700 --> 3:37:40.340]  And we're in this fight together, folks.
[3:37:40.340 --> 3:37:41.740]  And that's how we can show Donald Trump
[3:37:41.740 --> 3:37:42.860]  that he has our support.
[3:37:42.860 --> 3:37:45.900]  No matter what the establishment tries to do,
[3:37:45.900 --> 3:37:47.460]  we're behind you, Donald.
[3:37:47.460 --> 3:37:48.460]  And we support your agenda.
[3:37:48.460 --> 3:37:50.260]  We know you want to put American first.
[3:37:50.260 --> 3:37:52.580]  Let's go to James in Oklahoma.
[3:37:52.580 --> 3:37:53.740]  Let's talk about wiretapping.
[3:37:53.740 --> 3:37:54.580]  Go ahead, James.
[3:37:55.700 --> 3:37:57.620]  Hi guys, how you doing?
[3:37:57.620 --> 3:37:58.460]  I'm doing great.
[3:37:58.460 --> 3:37:59.900]  What's on your mind?
[3:37:59.900 --> 3:38:02.020]  Well, this is the thing.
[3:38:02.020 --> 3:38:04.300]  Donald Trump is right about what's going on
[3:38:04.300 --> 3:38:05.620]  with this wiretapping.
[3:38:05.620 --> 3:38:07.380]  In fact, I've actually done digging
[3:38:07.380 --> 3:38:09.340]  and I've done a lot of asking around,
[3:38:09.340 --> 3:38:11.420]  not just with people in the government,
[3:38:11.420 --> 3:38:13.940]  but also with hackers that are on the streets.
[3:38:13.940 --> 3:38:15.820]  Have you ever heard of the term false positive
[3:38:15.820 --> 3:38:16.820]  in antivirus?
[3:38:17.940 --> 3:38:19.420]  Sure.
[3:38:19.420 --> 3:38:21.860]  Yes, this is the thing.
[3:38:21.860 --> 3:38:24.460]  Those are not really what's called false positive.
[3:38:24.460 --> 3:38:26.140]  They're actually what's called ketrogens
[3:38:26.140 --> 3:38:29.140]  and they're built into a lot of products
[3:38:29.140 --> 3:38:32.820]  like computers, phones, routers, all sorts of stuff.
[3:38:32.820 --> 3:38:35.220]  And this is where all this sort of backdoor
[3:38:35.220 --> 3:38:37.620]  that Edward Snowden was talking about.
[3:38:37.620 --> 3:38:40.100]  This is what Edward Snowden was preaching about.
[3:38:40.100 --> 3:38:42.540]  And that's what I'm coming forward with.
[3:38:42.540 --> 3:38:44.660]  Donald Trump, you're right.
[3:38:44.660 --> 3:38:45.500]  I know you're right
[3:38:45.500 --> 3:38:47.340]  because I've actually gotten hacked
[3:38:47.340 --> 3:38:50.220]  on September 21st, 2015.
[3:38:50.220 --> 3:38:52.500]  That's when I started doing digging.
[3:38:52.500 --> 3:38:55.940]  And then everybody else got hacked on Microsoft and Skype.
[3:38:55.940 --> 3:38:58.380]  I've tried cooperating with law enforcement
[3:38:58.380 --> 3:39:00.580]  but have heard nothing back.
[3:39:00.580 --> 3:39:04.300]  And this has had a terrible impact on my life
[3:39:04.300 --> 3:39:05.220]  when I got hacked.
[3:39:05.220 --> 3:39:07.540]  So I want to come forward and expose this.
[3:39:07.540 --> 3:39:08.660]  So wait, hold on a second.
[3:39:08.660 --> 3:39:12.500]  More specifically, what kind of hacking are you referring to?
[3:39:13.340 --> 3:39:14.380]  Well, this is the thing.
[3:39:14.380 --> 3:39:17.980]  When it happened in September 21st, 2015,
[3:39:17.980 --> 3:39:21.740]  this crippled Microsoft's core system on Skype.
[3:39:21.740 --> 3:39:25.380]  And I talked to someone that worked with IT,
[3:39:25.380 --> 3:39:28.740]  the computer companies that worked with Microsoft.
[3:39:28.740 --> 3:39:31.460]  They said they have to be super intelligent
[3:39:31.460 --> 3:39:34.460]  in computers to actually do something like this.
[3:39:34.460 --> 3:39:38.740]  Sure, or know the backdoors that were put in place.
[3:39:38.740 --> 3:39:40.460]  And Windows puts these things in.
[3:39:40.460 --> 3:39:42.780]  In fact, they actually had a goal,
[3:39:42.780 --> 3:39:46.700]  the headlines recently that someone came forward
[3:39:46.700 --> 3:39:50.340]  with the golden key backdoor for Windows.
[3:39:50.340 --> 3:39:53.340]  And it went public and it caused so much problems.
[3:39:54.300 --> 3:39:57.460]  And that's what people were not noticing.
[3:39:57.460 --> 3:39:58.500]  Okay, so you're saying,
[3:39:58.500 --> 3:40:00.780]  okay, so you're saying people use backdoors
[3:40:00.780 --> 3:40:02.380]  to hack into your Windows system.
[3:40:02.380 --> 3:40:05.060]  Are you saying that you had documents taken
[3:40:05.060 --> 3:40:07.420]  or what exactly did you have to deal with here?
[3:40:07.420 --> 3:40:09.660]  And how does this relate to Donald Trump?
[3:40:09.660 --> 3:40:11.540]  The thing is, I was actually talking to a guy
[3:40:11.540 --> 3:40:13.620]  that actually was involved with the hacking
[3:40:13.620 --> 3:40:14.580]  before this happened.
[3:40:14.580 --> 3:40:15.820]  He stole my wallet.
[3:40:15.820 --> 3:40:17.300]  He didn't have my pen.
[3:40:17.300 --> 3:40:20.940]  But the thing is, his dad was supposedly an FBI agent.
[3:40:21.900 --> 3:40:25.060]  And I was trying to give his dad information
[3:40:25.060 --> 3:40:28.700]  on the assassination camp that I was trying to go with.
[3:40:28.700 --> 3:40:32.820]  And the thing is, this place is on Google Earth.
[3:40:32.820 --> 3:40:36.140]  I have the Google Earth coordinates for this place.
[3:40:37.180 --> 3:40:38.420]  And you can pull it up.
[3:40:38.420 --> 3:40:41.380]  But the thing is, they were trying to get information
[3:40:41.380 --> 3:40:43.420]  on me on what I had.
[3:40:43.420 --> 3:40:44.260]  And they ended up-
[3:40:44.260 --> 3:40:45.100]  Well, here's the thing, here's the thing.
[3:40:45.100 --> 3:40:46.620]  And you can tweet that at me,
[3:40:46.620 --> 3:40:49.340]  tweet me that story or the Google Earth coordinates
[3:40:49.340 --> 3:40:50.420]  at all I do is own.
[3:40:50.420 --> 3:40:52.620]  But here's the thing that I think you're alluding to
[3:40:52.620 --> 3:40:54.260]  as far as Donald Trump is concerned
[3:40:54.260 --> 3:40:56.780]  in the bigger picture here.
[3:40:56.780 --> 3:40:58.900]  When you're talking about Edward Snowden.
[3:41:00.340 --> 3:41:04.060]  Barack Obama doesn't need to wiretap Donald Trump, folks.
[3:41:04.980 --> 3:41:08.540]  Their surveillance programs are already in place.
[3:41:08.540 --> 3:41:13.540]  So essentially, if anybody who could get
[3:41:13.620 --> 3:41:18.620]  into the NSA's files, or get into all of these phone records,
[3:41:19.700 --> 3:41:23.020]  wanted to do it, and they wanted to go look
[3:41:23.020 --> 3:41:27.180]  at Donald Trump's metadata, or Donald Trump's phone records,
[3:41:27.180 --> 3:41:30.540]  or who knows, maybe even pull entire conversations,
[3:41:30.540 --> 3:41:33.060]  maybe even get transcripts from conversations,
[3:41:34.020 --> 3:41:35.700]  they have that ability.
[3:41:36.460 --> 3:41:39.100]  Really, you don't think that that goes on, folks?
[3:41:39.100 --> 3:41:40.180]  I mean, give me a break.
[3:41:40.180 --> 3:41:42.100]  We're living in a digital planet.
[3:41:43.900 --> 3:41:46.380]  If you don't, let me just say something.
[3:41:46.380 --> 3:41:50.620]  If you don't act with discretion,
[3:41:50.620 --> 3:41:53.100]  when you've got your cell phone on or around you,
[3:41:53.100 --> 3:41:55.860]  you are an absolute fool.
[3:41:55.860 --> 3:41:56.700]  You understand me?
[3:41:56.700 --> 3:41:58.420]  An absolute fool.
[3:41:59.900 --> 3:42:01.420]  Sure, maybe nobody's spying on you,
[3:42:01.420 --> 3:42:03.020]  maybe nobody cares what you're doing.
[3:42:03.020 --> 3:42:04.780]  Oh, but guess what?
[3:42:04.780 --> 3:42:06.420]  They just released the documents.
[3:42:06.420 --> 3:42:09.620]  Cell phone radiation can lead to cancer.
[3:42:10.540 --> 3:42:12.620]  Better smarten up about these cell phones, folks.
[3:42:12.620 --> 3:42:15.060]  That's just the God-honest truth.
[3:42:15.060 --> 3:42:17.380]  Let's go out to Rob in Canada.
[3:42:17.380 --> 3:42:20.620]  Rob, are you concerned about Trump's safety?
[3:42:20.620 --> 3:42:23.420]  I seriously am, Owen.
[3:42:23.420 --> 3:42:24.420]  Well, we gotta pray for him.
[3:42:24.420 --> 3:42:25.580]  Go ahead, Rob.
[3:42:25.580 --> 3:42:30.220]  Okay, well, I've been studying a lot with the, not with,
[3:42:30.220 --> 3:42:35.220]  but I've been studying the Illuminati and the Scalom bones.
[3:42:36.020 --> 3:42:38.980]  And the thing that I'm concerned about
[3:42:38.980 --> 3:42:42.580]  is March 22nd, 3-2-2.
[3:42:42.580 --> 3:42:46.380]  And the number three and seven
[3:42:46.380 --> 3:42:50.380]  are both sacred numbers to the Scalom bones.
[3:42:52.180 --> 3:42:54.380]  Okay, well, I mean, honestly,
[3:42:54.380 --> 3:42:56.980]  I'm not really too into the new numerology thing.
[3:42:56.980 --> 3:42:59.980]  I know a lot of people put a ton of onus on that.
[3:42:59.980 --> 3:43:04.580]  They study it nonstop even, but I've heard too much of that.
[3:43:04.580 --> 3:43:06.980]  I've heard too much on this day, this numerology,
[3:43:06.980 --> 3:43:09.380]  that I just can't really take too much into that.
[3:43:09.380 --> 3:43:12.580]  I'm not disagreeing with Rob from Canada.
[3:43:12.580 --> 3:43:17.180]  I do think that Trump's safety is certainly a serious issue.
[3:43:17.180 --> 3:43:19.180]  Of course, they want to try to write Donald Trump
[3:43:19.180 --> 3:43:20.180]  off the face of the earth.
[3:43:20.180 --> 3:43:22.580]  He's steering the ship of liberty right into the bow
[3:43:22.580 --> 3:43:24.180]  of the globalists to sink their ship.
[3:43:24.180 --> 3:43:27.780]  So yes, of course, Donald Trump's safety is a serious issue.
[3:43:27.780 --> 3:43:31.180]  Whether March 22nd or not, there's a raised concern there.
[3:43:31.180 --> 3:43:34.180]  Certainly, I guess that's what you believe,
[3:43:34.180 --> 3:43:35.980]  but that's not something I would think
[3:43:35.980 --> 3:43:36.980]  that there's too much behind.
[3:43:36.980 --> 3:43:40.380]  But I know how these people buy into the numerology thing.
[3:43:40.380 --> 3:43:43.780]  So let's go out to, is this GG in Indiana?
[3:43:43.780 --> 3:43:46.380]  It wants to talk about the MSN, mainstream media.
[3:43:46.380 --> 3:43:47.380]  Go ahead.
[3:43:47.380 --> 3:43:48.380]  Oh, yeah.
[3:43:48.380 --> 3:43:50.380]  This is no gig, G-I-G.
[3:43:50.380 --> 3:43:51.380]  All right, gig.
[3:43:51.380 --> 3:43:53.380]  You go gigging?
[3:43:53.380 --> 3:43:54.780]  Do you go gigging in Indiana?
[3:43:54.780 --> 3:43:56.380]  Is that why they call you gig?
[3:43:56.380 --> 3:43:59.980]  I'm actually the crazy fox hat guy that was on the talking
[3:43:59.980 --> 3:44:00.980]  dead a few years back.
[3:44:00.980 --> 3:44:05.380]  But anyhow, I wanted to mention something that, you know,
[3:44:05.380 --> 3:44:08.780]  with this news, it's like anytime you flip on the news anymore,
[3:44:08.780 --> 3:44:11.180]  there's not any news anymore.
[3:44:11.180 --> 3:44:12.180]  It's all politics.
[3:44:12.180 --> 3:44:13.580]  And when I flip on these...
[3:44:13.580 --> 3:44:15.580]  You are absolutely correct.
[3:44:15.580 --> 3:44:20.980]  In fact, if you tune into MSN or CNN, it's not even politics.
[3:44:20.980 --> 3:44:22.380]  It's just Trump bashing.
[3:44:22.380 --> 3:44:23.580]  That is such a great point.
[3:44:23.580 --> 3:44:24.580]  I've said it over and over again.
[3:44:24.580 --> 3:44:26.580]  They don't even report news anymore.
[3:44:26.580 --> 3:44:27.980]  There is no news anymore.
[3:44:27.980 --> 3:44:29.780]  It's just bash Trump, delegitimize Trump.
[3:44:29.780 --> 3:44:30.780]  Go ahead, gig.
[3:44:30.780 --> 3:44:33.980]  When the gosh darned fighters were going on down in Tennessee
[3:44:33.980 --> 3:44:35.380]  and the tornadoes, you could not...
[3:44:35.380 --> 3:44:37.780]  The only way I could get news was going to the Blair Champ.
[3:44:37.780 --> 3:44:39.780]  Yeah, it's wild.
[3:44:39.780 --> 3:44:44.180]  Fukushima is melting down, destroying the Pacific Ocean.
[3:44:44.180 --> 3:44:47.180]  But, you know, they're just going to cover Trump.
[3:44:47.180 --> 3:44:48.180]  Because he's...
[3:44:48.180 --> 3:44:52.580]  He is the threat to the world order.
[3:44:52.580 --> 3:44:53.780]  Go ahead.
[3:44:53.780 --> 3:44:58.180]  I guess my point is, you know, in my weird ways, I'm kind of a...
[3:44:58.180 --> 3:45:00.780]  I guess you'd call a nerd, toy collector, TV show,
[3:45:00.780 --> 3:45:02.180]  enthusiast, whatever.
[3:45:02.180 --> 3:45:05.180]  And there's this Stinson's episode where all the advertisements
[3:45:05.180 --> 3:45:07.980]  come to life and they can't figure out how to shut them down.
[3:45:07.980 --> 3:45:09.580]  Well, they end up figuring out how to shut them down
[3:45:09.580 --> 3:45:11.980]  by just turning their heads on them and ignoring them.
[3:45:11.980 --> 3:45:13.180]  And to me, that's my point.
[3:45:13.180 --> 3:45:15.980]  Is all of our end of the talk shows,
[3:45:15.980 --> 3:45:19.180]  whether you're talking handy or back or...
[3:45:19.180 --> 3:45:20.780]  Not back, forgive me, I'm nervous here,
[3:45:20.780 --> 3:45:22.780]  but handy or you guys or whatever.
[3:45:22.780 --> 3:45:25.580]  And I have the shows discussed about what MSM said this
[3:45:25.580 --> 3:45:26.980]  and MSM said that.
[3:45:26.980 --> 3:45:28.180]  Who cares what they say?
[3:45:28.180 --> 3:45:31.980]  Let's just get our narrative across and ignore them.
[3:45:31.980 --> 3:45:33.980]  And I understand what you're saying.
[3:45:33.980 --> 3:45:35.380]  I totally understand what you're saying.
[3:45:35.380 --> 3:45:38.780]  But the reason why we cover the mainstream media
[3:45:38.780 --> 3:45:41.780]  and what they're doing is because they are a political wing
[3:45:41.780 --> 3:45:44.580]  of the establishment, a propaganda wing.
[3:45:44.580 --> 3:45:47.780]  So we cover it in a sense to cover the propaganda,
[3:45:47.780 --> 3:45:51.580]  call out the propaganda in a desperate attempt
[3:45:51.580 --> 3:45:54.580]  to expose to the general population
[3:45:54.580 --> 3:45:57.980]  that the mainstream news is for the most part fake news.
[3:45:57.980 --> 3:45:59.380]  So that's why we do what we do
[3:45:59.380 --> 3:46:01.780]  as far as covering their propaganda is concerned.
[3:46:01.780 --> 3:46:05.180]  And I do think it's working because a lot of people
[3:46:05.180 --> 3:46:06.980]  either already don't trust the news,
[3:46:06.980 --> 3:46:08.180]  already hate the news,
[3:46:08.180 --> 3:46:10.780]  or are already a bit skeptical of the news.
[3:46:10.780 --> 3:46:14.980]  So if you can siphon that energy
[3:46:14.980 --> 3:46:17.380]  and then get their attention here,
[3:46:17.380 --> 3:46:22.780]  I feel like those are eventual members of the good fight
[3:46:22.780 --> 3:46:24.780]  that may not fully understand what's going on.
[3:46:24.780 --> 3:46:25.780]  They may not trust the news.
[3:46:25.780 --> 3:46:27.780]  But that's why we cover the propaganda.
[3:46:27.780 --> 3:46:28.780]  I hear what you're saying.
[3:46:28.780 --> 3:46:30.580]  It's almost just like ignore the mainstream news
[3:46:30.580 --> 3:46:31.580]  and they'll disappear.
[3:46:31.580 --> 3:46:32.580]  I've asked the question on air.
[3:46:32.580 --> 3:46:35.380]  Should I just stop watching CNN?
[3:46:35.380 --> 3:46:37.380]  Some people say yes, some people say no.
[3:46:37.380 --> 3:46:39.180]  But that's why we do what we do
[3:46:39.180 --> 3:46:41.180]  as far as covering the mainstream news.
[3:46:41.180 --> 3:46:44.980]  And honestly, I don't think, I mean, I can't stop.
[3:46:44.980 --> 3:46:47.580]  I can't stop calling out the propaganda, folks.
[3:46:47.580 --> 3:46:48.780]  I mean, even if I wanted to,
[3:46:48.780 --> 3:46:50.380]  it's almost like an addiction at this point.
[3:46:50.380 --> 3:46:53.380]  It's like, are you going to stop defending yourself
[3:46:53.380 --> 3:46:54.980]  against the boxer and the ring
[3:46:54.980 --> 3:46:56.580]  who keeps hitting you with the right jab?
[3:46:56.580 --> 3:46:58.580]  No, you're going to defend yourself against the right jab.
[3:46:58.580 --> 3:46:59.780]  The coach is going to say, hey,
[3:46:59.780 --> 3:47:00.780]  he's hitting you with the right jab.
[3:47:00.780 --> 3:47:02.380]  There it is. Protect yourself from it.
[3:47:02.380 --> 3:47:04.180]  So I kind of feel like that's what we're doing.
[3:47:04.180 --> 3:47:07.980]  Let's move on to John, who is in New York
[3:47:07.980 --> 3:47:09.980]  and he thinks there's some shocking upcoming events.
[3:47:09.980 --> 3:47:11.780]  Go ahead, John.
[3:47:11.780 --> 3:47:16.180]  Yes, I'm going to read a little bit about just the dates
[3:47:16.180 --> 3:47:18.580]  of a satanic ritual agenda.
[3:47:18.580 --> 3:47:21.780]  And one of them is Walter's Day,
[3:47:21.780 --> 3:47:27.780]  which is a blood ritual day with fire.
[3:47:27.780 --> 3:47:31.180]  And that is May 1st and that is when Zola Linsky
[3:47:31.180 --> 3:47:34.380]  and those guys are going to start busting in the 300,
[3:47:34.380 --> 3:47:37.580]  the 3 million people into Washington, D.C.
[3:47:37.580 --> 3:47:42.580]  Preceding this is an even more specific satanic holiday
[3:47:42.580 --> 3:47:45.580]  and those are the holidays of Beltane,
[3:47:45.580 --> 3:47:50.380]  which involve human sacrifices and assassinations.
[3:47:50.380 --> 3:47:54.380]  Now, most of the public has no awareness of this.
[3:47:54.380 --> 3:47:57.780]  And in Washington, D.C., you have several
[3:47:57.780 --> 3:47:59.180]  what are called sinotapses.
[3:47:59.180 --> 3:48:00.580]  Most people don't know what that is,
[3:48:00.580 --> 3:48:05.980]  but it's basically a voodoo canary jar placed in a grave
[3:48:05.980 --> 3:48:10.780]  to capture the living energy of somebody that's just died.
[3:48:10.780 --> 3:48:15.780]  Now, in Washington, D.C. is a Masonic graveyard
[3:48:15.780 --> 3:48:19.780]  with a picture of Seth at the top of the arch into this.
[3:48:19.780 --> 3:48:21.580]  It's the Lincoln graveyard,
[3:48:21.580 --> 3:48:25.180]  but a straight line runs into a circle.
[3:48:25.180 --> 3:48:29.980]  And there is another amulet,
[3:48:29.980 --> 3:48:32.980]  which is actually the Washington Monument
[3:48:32.980 --> 3:48:35.380]  and that is the sinotap.
[3:48:35.380 --> 3:48:38.180]  Yeah, you're talking about how you can lay all this out
[3:48:38.180 --> 3:48:41.980]  in Washington, D.C. and you can get a upside down star,
[3:48:41.980 --> 3:48:43.580]  whatever, Satan symbol.
[3:48:43.580 --> 3:48:45.580]  Well, no, no, I'm not talking about that.
[3:48:45.580 --> 3:48:47.580]  I'm talking about the fact that these two go
[3:48:47.580 --> 3:48:49.580]  into overlapping circles
[3:48:49.580 --> 3:48:54.980]  and it produces a vagina-type thing inside the Oval Office.
[3:48:54.980 --> 3:48:56.780]  Well, here's the thing, here's the thing.
[3:48:56.780 --> 3:48:57.980]  I'm sure that you know what you're talking about.
[3:48:57.980 --> 3:49:00.780]  You've done your research, but it's not just one.
[3:49:00.780 --> 3:49:02.980]  I don't think that there's one thing we can focus on there.
[3:49:02.980 --> 3:49:08.580]  We already know that they're doing which like ceremonies
[3:49:08.580 --> 3:49:09.780]  to go against Trump.
[3:49:09.780 --> 3:49:12.380]  Of course, the Satanists are trying to do everything they can.
[3:49:12.380 --> 3:49:15.980]  We just had the story of the illegal immigrants
[3:49:15.980 --> 3:49:19.380]  that were here doing Satan worship ceremonies.
[3:49:19.380 --> 3:49:21.380]  Murdering women.
[3:49:21.380 --> 3:49:24.380]  So, yes, this is going on, folks.
[3:49:24.380 --> 3:49:30.380]  This is the driving force out of that.
[3:49:30.380 --> 3:49:31.380]  I don't know.
[3:49:31.380 --> 3:49:33.380]  I don't know why the mainstream news ignores Satanism.
[3:49:33.380 --> 3:49:36.380]  Most people don't even know that Satanism is real.
[3:49:36.380 --> 3:49:38.380]  Most people don't know that there's witches out there
[3:49:38.380 --> 3:49:41.380]  doing black masses.
[3:49:41.380 --> 3:49:44.380]  Look at the freaking emails.
[3:49:44.380 --> 3:49:46.380]  Look at the freaking WikiLeaks.
[3:49:46.380 --> 3:49:48.380]  These people are messed up, man.
[3:49:48.380 --> 3:49:50.380]  Look at the Podesta Art Collection.
[3:49:50.380 --> 3:49:52.380]  What the hell is that?
[3:49:52.380 --> 3:49:53.380]  Excuse me.
[3:49:53.380 --> 3:49:56.380]  I'm sorry that I don't have weird art in my room.
[3:49:56.380 --> 3:49:58.380]  Just...
[3:49:58.380 --> 3:50:00.380]  Satanism is real, okay?
[3:50:00.380 --> 3:50:02.380]  Satanism is real.
[3:50:02.380 --> 3:50:08.380]  And it's infiltrated serious top levels of our government, folks.
[3:50:08.380 --> 3:50:10.380]  And everything trickles down from the top.
[3:50:10.380 --> 3:50:13.380]  Why do you think people are out here doing witch ceremonies
[3:50:13.380 --> 3:50:14.380]  to go against Donald Trump?
[3:50:14.380 --> 3:50:16.380]  Why do you think Madonna and all of these freaks
[3:50:16.380 --> 3:50:19.380]  are putting on pussy hats and walking around in the streets?
[3:50:19.380 --> 3:50:21.380]  Look at all their little minions.
[3:50:21.380 --> 3:50:24.380]  All the little brainwashed minions they put on their little pussy hats
[3:50:24.380 --> 3:50:26.380]  and they walk around and they try to march against Trump.
[3:50:26.380 --> 3:50:27.380]  Look at this.
[3:50:27.380 --> 3:50:32.380]  I have been 30, 40, 50 Trump events.
[3:50:32.380 --> 3:50:33.380]  It doesn't matter.
[3:50:33.380 --> 3:50:34.380]  Any media.
[3:50:34.380 --> 3:50:35.380]  Any media.
[3:50:35.380 --> 3:50:36.380]  Not just infowars.
[3:50:36.380 --> 3:50:38.380]  Any media talks to Trump supporters in the streets.
[3:50:38.380 --> 3:50:39.380]  They're smart.
[3:50:39.380 --> 3:50:40.380]  They're happy.
[3:50:40.380 --> 3:50:41.380]  They're well-spoken.
[3:50:41.380 --> 3:50:42.380]  You talk to a Trump hater.
[3:50:42.380 --> 3:50:43.380]  They're witches.
[3:50:43.380 --> 3:50:44.380]  They're yelling.
[3:50:44.380 --> 3:50:45.380]  They're cackling.
[3:50:45.380 --> 3:50:47.380]  Ha, ha, Trump's racist.
[3:50:47.380 --> 3:50:48.380]  Ha, final segment.
[3:50:48.380 --> 3:50:50.380]  Your call is on the other side.
[3:50:50.380 --> 3:50:51.380]  Sick of this.

[3:54:21.380 --> 3:54:23.380]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:54:23.380 --> 3:54:28.380]  Drudge just added to their headlines, Mika Burzinski freaking out.
[3:54:28.380 --> 3:54:31.380]  Oh my gosh, we are in such synchronicity right now.
[3:54:31.380 --> 3:54:35.380]  The Patriots in the media, the Patriots in the streets, just all of us.
[3:54:35.380 --> 3:54:38.380]  I mean, this movement is real, folks.
[3:54:38.380 --> 3:54:42.380]  I mean, when this thing reaches its head, just get ready.
[3:54:42.380 --> 3:54:45.380]  Let's go out to Carlos in Canada.
[3:54:45.380 --> 3:54:47.380]  Want to talk leaks and NSA?
[3:54:47.380 --> 3:54:49.380]  Go ahead, Carlos.
[3:54:49.380 --> 3:54:51.380]  Thank you, Owen.
[3:54:51.380 --> 3:54:52.380]  Yes, thank you.
[3:54:52.380 --> 3:54:59.380]  I'm from Canada and I want to just share with you a little anecdote that happened in 2000 on the program 60 Minutes.
[3:54:59.380 --> 3:55:04.380]  A fellow by the name of Mike Frost, who was with CESIS, the Canadian agency,
[3:55:04.380 --> 3:55:11.380]  reported that when he was working from 72 to 1992, in 1983,
[3:55:11.380 --> 3:55:19.380]  Lady Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of Britain at that time, wanted to know and spy on two of her ministers.
[3:55:19.380 --> 3:55:22.380]  Well, she wasn't allowed to by law.
[3:55:22.380 --> 3:55:27.380]  So she arranged with one of five other countries, including Canada,
[3:55:27.380 --> 3:55:30.380]  that was sharing intelligence at the highest level.
[3:55:30.380 --> 3:55:32.380]  This was the echelon program.
[3:55:32.380 --> 3:55:36.380]  This program could still be available today,
[3:55:36.380 --> 3:55:42.380]  but what I do want to tell you is that what's going on with President Trump is precisely that,
[3:55:42.380 --> 3:55:46.380]  because by having Canada spy on her ministers,
[3:55:46.380 --> 3:55:54.380]  and if you remember, sometime later, there was a leaks of conversations between Prince Charles and other people,
[3:55:54.380 --> 3:55:57.380]  and Lady Diana and other people.
[3:55:57.380 --> 3:56:01.380]  This gave the parliament total deniability by saying,
[3:56:01.380 --> 3:56:06.380]  no, no, no, we're not investigating Margaret Thatcher. I never instructed anything,
[3:56:06.380 --> 3:56:09.380]  because the information wasn't against the law.
[3:56:09.380 --> 3:56:11.380]  You see, it was done by another country.
[3:56:11.380 --> 3:56:13.380]  And present day...
[3:56:13.380 --> 3:56:15.380]  These people know what they're doing.
[3:56:15.380 --> 3:56:21.380]  They know how to be very litigious as far as their actions are concerned to avoid litigation,
[3:56:21.380 --> 3:56:26.380]  and they have all sorts of loopholes and passing the buck opportunities exactly.
[3:56:26.380 --> 3:56:28.380]  And here's my other thing, too.
[3:56:28.380 --> 3:56:32.380]  With this giant surveillance grid in place,
[3:56:32.380 --> 3:56:38.380]  you know, you could essentially be getting spied on since the day you're born,
[3:56:38.380 --> 3:56:41.380]  with all the cameras, all the sound equipment just everywhere,
[3:56:41.380 --> 3:56:43.380]  they could just essentially tap into, turn on,
[3:56:43.380 --> 3:56:45.380]  especially with the access that we grant them,
[3:56:45.380 --> 3:56:50.380]  when we unknowingly click accept terms and conditions without reading them.
[3:56:50.380 --> 3:56:53.380]  You could essentially get spied on for your whole life.
[3:56:53.380 --> 3:56:57.380]  Who knows what type of blackmail opportunities that provides?
[3:56:57.380 --> 3:57:02.380]  Who knows what type of lengths people might go to avoid blackmail getting out?
[3:57:02.380 --> 3:57:04.380]  This is how you control a government.
[3:57:04.380 --> 3:57:06.380]  This is how you control a Senate.
[3:57:06.380 --> 3:57:08.380]  This is how you control an intelligence agency.
[3:57:08.380 --> 3:57:12.380]  This is how you control a presidency.
[3:57:12.380 --> 3:57:15.380]  Of course they're freaked out. Russia has blackmail on Trump.
[3:57:15.380 --> 3:57:19.380]  They've had blackmail probably on every president since I've been alive.
[3:57:19.380 --> 3:57:21.380]  Of course they're freaked out.
[3:57:21.380 --> 3:57:24.380]  How do you think they control the president?
[3:57:24.380 --> 3:57:27.380]  Oh wow, we don't have control over Trump. It must be Russia.
[3:57:27.380 --> 3:57:28.380]  Someone's got control over him.
[3:57:28.380 --> 3:57:31.380]  There can't be a guy in office who's actually Americana.
[3:57:31.380 --> 3:57:33.380]  There can't be a guy in office who's actually real.
[3:57:33.380 --> 3:57:36.380]  No way! It must be Russia!
[3:57:36.380 --> 3:57:39.380]  As he's returning jobs here, returning manufacturing here,
[3:57:39.380 --> 3:57:42.380]  preaching America first, talking about stepping on other planets,
[3:57:42.380 --> 3:57:45.380]  Donald Trump is an absolute champion.
[3:57:45.380 --> 3:57:48.380]  Man, we've been waiting for Donald Trump forever.
[3:57:48.380 --> 3:57:50.380]  Crush him, Donald! Crush him!
[3:57:50.380 --> 3:57:52.380]  Let's go to Alex in Ukraine.
[3:57:52.380 --> 3:57:55.380]  Let's talk about revolution. This is the revolution, baby.
[3:57:55.380 --> 3:57:56.380]  Go ahead.
[3:57:56.380 --> 3:57:57.380]  Hey, Owen, how are you doing?
[3:57:57.380 --> 3:57:59.380]  Make it quick, make it quick.
[3:57:59.380 --> 3:58:05.380]  Yeah, I just think that Trump should watch what happened in Ukraine
[3:58:05.380 --> 3:58:09.380]  because things feel just the same, you know, here of what's going on now.
[3:58:09.380 --> 3:58:12.380]  Everybody in the beginning, yeah, the president Yanukovych,
[3:58:12.380 --> 3:58:15.380]  he's corrupt, all presidents are corrupt in Ukraine.
[3:58:15.380 --> 3:58:18.380]  That's right, and George Soros has said that they will bring an Arab Spring to America.
[3:58:18.380 --> 3:58:20.380]  You're absolutely correct.
[3:58:20.380 --> 3:58:23.380]  Thank you so much for calling in from Ukraine and sharing your story.
[3:58:23.380 --> 3:58:24.380]  Thanks everybody that tuned in.
[3:58:24.380 --> 3:58:26.380]  Owen Shroyer signing off for the Alex Jones Show.
