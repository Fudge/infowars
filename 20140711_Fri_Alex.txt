[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:16.000 --> 00:27.000]  radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well I can tell you right now ladies and gentlemen this is going to be a Friday
[00:27.000 --> 00:35.000]  transmission you don't want to miss the news the good the bad and the ugly is off the charts important and quite frankly riveting and
[00:35.000 --> 00:44.000]  sensational I'm in a good focus mood and we've got three or four amazing guests Max Kaiser in the third hour to break down the
[00:44.000 --> 00:52.000]  accelerating global financial meltdown that he's accurately predicted Dr. Ron Paul the former congressman a lot of key intel will be
[00:52.000 --> 01:03.000]  joining us as well Mark Harrington who shot the video of the troll real live troll that actually showed up in Cincinnati Ohio
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.000]  running around attacking pro-lifers he's going to be joining us to talk about the harrowing tail coming face to face with
[01:09.000 --> 01:21.000]  Grendel's mother and then we've got Joe Biggs who's got some amazing video with our own Joe Jennings out in southern California
[01:21.000 --> 01:28.000]  actually a hundred miles from the border they've been down the border as well there in Marietta with Lauraza vowing to help get the
[01:28.000 --> 01:37.000]  illegals in I don't know why they need to vow to help get the illegals in I mean Rick Perry says put drones on the border is asking
[01:37.000 --> 01:44.000]  Obama to to what help pick up more people better and then put them on buses to ship them into welfare centers to be signed up
[01:44.000 --> 01:53.000]  as democratic voters I mean that's the issue we're missing here the border patrol picks them up and then ships them out
[01:53.000 --> 02:03.000]  everywhere and releases them four weeks ago we had a nice agent senior with his voice disguise there's a gag order in the
[02:03.000 --> 02:10.000]  truck with us we went and met him in the field recorded it changed his voice selling us what the head of the border patrol
[02:10.000 --> 02:19.000]  union already said and the deputy had the vice president months ago there's an ordered stand down and they let them out at
[02:19.000 --> 02:27.000]  night just let them out in cities they take them to churches and schools and then use that to infiltrate the people they just
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.000]  dump them out and say go to this welfare place the trolleys right over there the bus stations right over there here's
[02:32.000 --> 02:40.000]  your voucher after busing them deeper in that's the big kahuna that's the big issue hiding in plain view the border patrols
[02:40.000 --> 02:50.000]  told you ISIS told you we've told you it's confirmed but the media even Republican dominated media like Fox News still
[02:50.000 --> 02:59.000]  acts like they don't know what's going on but Sean Hannity last night had a guest on board patrol agent Hector Garza
[02:59.000 --> 03:08.000]  and he said listen the border patrol completes the smuggling process and that's what I've been saying that's what I was
[03:08.000 --> 03:16.000]  saying the border patrol yesterday you know shouting over big who was then repeating the questions and again I don't
[03:16.000 --> 03:22.000]  even blame the border patrol but they're the people doing it I get they don't want to do it I get they know it's illegal
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  I know they're blowing the whistle doesn't matter they're still following orders it'd be like if I loved a firearm and
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  but somebody use it to kill me I mean I don't like the firearm at the point somebody's using it to kill me I'm not
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  against the border patrol I like the border patrol for the only constitutional federal agencies they're certainly not
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  perfect now there's serious problems but they're committing the crime and I'm gonna say this again even if you want totally
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  open borders to collapsing Latin America do you want a government that can put laws on us but doesn't follow them that
[03:53.000 --> 04:06.000]  the definition the Krim dollar Krim the cream of the cream when you talk about tyranny it just it's so dangerous I don't
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  even know what to say at this point if people don't understand this means we're collapsing we're going into lawlessness
[04:11.000 --> 04:20.000]  and the public will stop following the law the governments can quit there's no legitimacy it means civil war and libertarians
[04:20.000 --> 04:26.000]  which I am one can argue all day well let's get rid of the borders let's just have war on the streets you don't want that
[04:26.000 --> 04:33.000]  with 101 million people that don't know how to tie their shoelaces and are on welfare I mean we're on Paul's right we need to
[04:33.000 --> 04:43.000]  get out of this incrementally seriously like you get somebody off heroin I mean this is a serious crisis we're in I don't
[04:43.000 --> 04:51.000]  want to describe it that's all coming up it's just wall to wall insanity judges are ruling pedophilia is okay we told you that

[08:12.000 --> 08:26.000]  Human Liberty it's Alex Jones
[08:26.000 --> 08:51.000]  we are living incredible history unfolding right now on this Friday 7 11 the 11th day of July 2014 I am your host Alex Jones former congressman Ron Paul's coming on to break down a host of key issues in the middle of the next hour
[08:51.000 --> 09:15.000]  we have Joe Biggs and Joe Jennings reporters on the ground still in Southern California they've been down to the border and up 100 plus miles away in Marietta where the border patrol is busting the illegals in and then policing citizens telling them they can't be on right of ways off major roads trying to order the police to throw them off
[09:15.000 --> 09:24.000]  and the border patrol does not look happy when they walk up and say I'm just following orders get off this sidewalk
[09:24.000 --> 09:40.000]  and then our guys say no and the border patrol backs off because we've confirmed not just through our reporters but through other border patrol in Texas and in California that they are refusing to arrest the demonstrators
[09:40.000 --> 09:55.000]  and so are the police and the word is the county sheriff has ordered arrest that was in the news a few days ago but it didn't happen so they're just holding the buses or diverting them to San Diego
[09:55.000 --> 10:12.000]  that's what's happening because the police are not following the orders so I'm criticizing them but at least they're not doing that and they'll probably get in trouble to arrest people on a sidewalk legally and lawfully
[10:12.000 --> 10:26.000]  and to arrest people that are ready to be arrested when they come block the buses that are illegal and then bust them in the middle of the town to turn the people loose I mean this is crazy
[10:26.000 --> 10:43.000]  until you realize that it is meant to elicit and trigger even more people on these dozens of trains that arrive a day from Guatemala that go all the way through Mexico this gorging tens of thousands a day
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.000]  each train carries between a thousand and five thousand souls
[10:49.000 --> 11:02.000]  so you're hearing numbers about tens of thousands a week tens of thousands a day and again it's bigger than just these poor immigrants who are pawns in the game
[11:02.000 --> 11:11.000]  it's much bigger than them it's about a government so illegitimate so lawless that it could do this I'm going to be breaking that down
[11:11.000 --> 11:21.000]  the tax guys that comes on about the global accelerated divergence away from the dollar that's now happening it's now officially happening I don't know if it can be reversed we'll talk to him
[11:21.000 --> 11:31.000]  this is pretty much most economists now agree that it's the end of the dollar age coming may take a year may take three years but maybe next week
[11:31.000 --> 11:37.000]  kind of like when you had six or seven heart attacks and you're 85 years old and you know you could die any day you might live two years
[11:37.000 --> 11:52.000]  all I know is we're sitting on top a mountain of political socioeconomic TNT and the Federal Reserve and the globalist are dancing around with flaming flamethrowers shooting him in the air around the TNT
[11:52.000 --> 12:06.000]  we got Max Kaiser coming up Ron Paul Mark Carrington who actually had the encounter with the goblin creature in Cincinnati Ohio that was running around attacking pro-lifers he actually saw one of the creatures
[12:06.000 --> 12:15.000]  he will be joining us to report on this the video is on info wars dot com and then we've got again Joe Biggs joining us coming up here about 20 minutes
[12:15.000 --> 12:25.000]  before I go any further this is one of the days where I look at the news and I say to myself you've got to hit this Jones you've never succeeded in just reading the headlines can you once just do your job we're going to try again right now
[12:25.000 --> 12:40.000]  when you first don't succeed try try again and again it's like the owl the old ad that says how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop a one a two a three crunch a three the world will never know
[12:40.000 --> 12:56.000]  what is in these stacks of this I never get to Morton some shows I get like a hundred pieces of news that's a blue moon let's just get into it here ladies and gentlemen first stack federal judge orders IRS to explain lost emails
[12:56.000 --> 13:11.000]  the national review to impeach holder House Republicans are getting more traction with the idea that impeaching the president himself I agree it's a nice order to start with that'll crack open the whole nest because you bring him down that's the
[13:11.000 --> 13:26.000]  talking the whole criminal operation from coming out GOP congressman we must file a resolution directing the sergeant arms to arrest lowest learner for contempt now you're talking resolution submitted a whole lowest learner in contempt
[13:26.000 --> 13:42.000]  Congress takes first step towards arrest jailing a former IRS division chief who's been caught red handed you bring her down the whole house of stinking filth goes down and it'll be a devastating victory and will scare the hell out of the corrupt Republican leadership as well
[13:42.000 --> 13:58.000]  we'll start impeaching them next we can route the entire enemy and save the Republic if we just believed it and stop believing the government run 501 C3 churches that are telling you it's the end of the world in 1989 and 1992 and 1997 and
[13:58.000 --> 14:13.000]  2007 listen justice be done may the heavens fall I'm going to go out and face corruption and not cop out and say it's the end of the world and the antichrist and praise the Lord they're putting chips in the troops brains now to make him behave that
[14:13.000 --> 14:30.000]  means antichrist will be here soon and I'll get my free ride to heaven you think you're gonna get a free ride sitting there on your butt saying praise the Lord that world governments being formed and pedophilia is being legalized in Australia
[14:30.000 --> 14:45.000]  and you're doing nothing to stop it praise the Lord there's all these abortions I'm not going to go out and protest them I'm just going to wait for my golden rope to come down and I'm going to get teleported up there to the deck of the enterprise because you got St. Michael all of them up there and they
[14:45.000 --> 15:00.000]  energize you and you up to heaven yet raptured out of of course isn't in the Bible until the end of the antichrist and the rest of it and the dead in Christ are raised that you can go read it a five year old could understand it and no doctor was taught until 200 years ago that
[15:00.000 --> 15:15.000]  was going on even if you don't believe in God the point is evil's taking over and you better oppose it okay see I said I would get to some articles and I didn't did I I just covered one stack let me just let me just get into this next stack
[15:15.000 --> 15:35.000]  San Francisco Giants may ban culturally insensitive attire at AT&T Park if you wear any type of baseball football you name it type of tire that shows any Native American Tomahawks headdresses you wear a headdress you're going to be thrown out because the quote Native Americans
[15:35.000 --> 15:51.000]  people that claim they are going to come over and henpeck you as social enforcers that you're not allowed to be wearing that so so this is the new social engineering on a mass scale all by design just like I told you not once not twice not 500 times
[15:51.000 --> 16:07.000]  thousands of times that after they pushed homosexuality on the public regardless of what you think of that that regardless what you think here's the agenda to sexualize children remember Gosselin elders it's in all the textbooks and to legalize
[16:07.000 --> 16:28.000]  pedophilia the UN has legalized it Nambla is part of the UN as an NGO look it up and now London Telegraph RT no US news will criticize this Australian judge says incest may no longer be taboo and that child molestation is okay basically you can go read the ruling
[16:28.000 --> 16:42.000]  well see that's when lawlessness comes in because anybody touches my children anybody touches them anybody tries to have sex with them or or or abuses them you know what's going to happen
[16:42.000 --> 16:58.000]  and this isn't premeditated when I'm saying I'm saying it's a default position that if you don't get justice you're going to get justice and they'll call that terrorism probably have me arrested someday because this is where all these socialist and communist regimes and is with
[16:58.000 --> 17:13.000]  your kids being run by the state for one reason and one reason alone they want to have their way with them what did I say yesterday and the day before in detail at the bottom of the rat hole of the New World Order not a rabbit hole but a rat hole at the bottom of the
[17:13.000 --> 17:29.000]  rat hole the judge went on to say that incest is only criminalized because of the high chance that any resulting offspring will be born with serious birth defects but added that even the risk falls away to an extent because there is the ease of
[17:29.000 --> 17:45.000]  contraception and readily access to abortion yeah kill the baby after you do that I mean anyone imagine being attracted to your children that is so sick ladies and gentlemen that is so disgusting instead in culture it's it's bad to be happy your
[17:45.000 --> 17:59.000]  daughter gets married at 20 and goes off and have kids that's a terrible thing no that's a wonderful thing you should be excited about your sons and daughters getting married and having kids but people like it don't have kids full of things taboo is having kids and completing the life cycle being fulfilled
[17:59.000 --> 18:10.000]  because they want you at an arrested development level because not everyone but some people do not trigger and activate and it's been proven genetically with epigenetics until you have children
[18:10.000 --> 18:20.000]  and I'm not saying people that have children are more advanced or better anything on average I'm just saying it triggers key life cycle events where you start thinking about the group not just yourself
[18:20.000 --> 18:28.000]  all right I've already died I've covered pretty good I haven't gotten into the huge border stack that's off the chart
[18:28.000 --> 18:43.000]  Megan Kelly calls Nancy Pelosi guilty of sexism see and the conservatives weigh in on this and start using political correctness going get him for a hate crime a black guy killed a white guy just it just just put the black guy in jail for murder
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  I mean you can get the death penalty a white guy kills a black guy get you know put him in jail give him a death penalty
[18:48.000 --> 19:00.000]  they said we need hate laws pass these clansmen drug an old black man to death in Viter, Texas or whatever it was they all got the death penalty you just can't get any more than that
[19:00.000 --> 19:08.000]  but the media would never say they had the death penalty like nothing was done couldn't even get a crime law passed in racist Texas
[19:08.000 --> 19:18.000]  I would see that on CNN for years and MSNBC they would never say by the way these guys are waiting to be executed I mean you can't do any more than that
[19:18.000 --> 19:26.000]  but they wanted to pass a law where they can arrest you for your speech and they plan to do it they've done it in England they've done it in Europe
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  and Megan Kelly's playing along with all of it
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  I'm not attacking Megan Kelly it's just ridiculous
[19:34.000 --> 19:43.000]  okay when we come back Typhoon Noguru did I just pronounce it Noguri?
[19:43.000 --> 19:54.000]  heads for Fukushima nuclear plant China's yawn rowing force and global finance AFP as the dollar declines the globalists are running America on the rocks

[24:33.000 --> 24:41.000]  video and audios up on info wars.com we're going to talk to Joe Biggs at the Civic Center site of where the socialists were two days ago
[24:41.000 --> 24:48.000]  openly saying it's Cloward and Piven
[24:48.000 --> 24:55.000]  I mean that's the headline socialist admit plan to collapse U.S. borders bring in Cloward and Piven
[24:55.000 --> 25:00.000]  and they're there come in immigrants because they know that demographically Latin American immigrants
[25:00.000 --> 25:06.000]  not even so much Mexican immigrants will vote for pure socialism
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.000]  and of course the globalists are offshore and administer the socialism so they don't care
[25:11.000 --> 25:21.000]  so let's go ahead and go over here the collapsing border news of the day
[25:21.000 --> 25:27.000]  then we're going to go to break and come back to Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  border patrol agent U.S. government completing the smuggling cycle
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.000]  I'm going to play that clip in the next segment very important
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.000]  fact I may play it now Governor Perry we need to secure border with a show of force
[25:44.000 --> 25:54.000]  the show of force is there the illegals show up and then are bused by the border patrol Perry and you know that
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.000]  so any more border patrol down there will just be to give tickets to people drinking beer on the Rio Grande
[26:00.000 --> 26:06.000]  I've witnessed it where the illegals walk right by them come into the U.S. and they're writing high school students
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.000]  or college students tickets for beer that's what they do is write tickets for beer I have it on video
[26:12.000 --> 26:20.000]  on video in the news report on last year so Perry knows what's going on the Republican leadership keeps playing dumb
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  the border patrol for almost four months has said stand down was ordered
[26:24.000 --> 26:32.000]  must say it again stand down was ordered and we have witnessed it shown the buses and proven it for almost four weeks
[26:32.000 --> 26:38.000]  no action the border patrol looks completely demoralized completely freaked out
[26:38.000 --> 26:44.000]  I mean there are unlimited radical Muslims coming across criminals you name it it's a joke okay
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  but they got federally funded checkpoints all over the country to randomly search you and your family
[26:48.000 --> 26:56.000]  what a joke what a joke it'd be like leaving your front door open in a bad neighborhood but tying your wife up
[26:56.000 --> 27:04.000]  to make sure robbers don't rape her I mean it's that stupid unless you want to control things unless you want to enslave people
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.000]  First Lady of Guatemala says illegal immigrants not refugees escaping violence
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.000]  she says they're entering U.S. to be united with families not escaping conflict
[27:15.000 --> 27:20.000]  yes the dream act and all these other pieces of amnesty legislation on record
[27:20.000 --> 27:29.000]  the ones bush brought forward to the same thing the same bill allow people here that are legal to bring anyone they want in their family
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.000]  you understand that's why because they know they're going to be legalized that's why they're here
[27:34.000 --> 27:43.000]  and yes their countries are hell I mean hell especially where they're from these are not the rich people of Latin America
[27:43.000 --> 27:49.000]  welcome middle-class scientists writers artists whatever you got a job you got a skill come up here
[27:49.000 --> 27:56.000]  single moms with five kids I mean my god we can't help you you're going to become that which is the plan again
[27:56.000 --> 28:03.000]  it's so simple Obama creates another humanitarian catastrophe this time in the USA
[28:03.000 --> 28:12.000]  for this act Obama may face impeachment that's the Russian news studies suggest more concealed carry permits less crime
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  I want to get into that separately I got in the immigration stack
[28:15.000 --> 28:21.000]  feds investigate racist depiction of Obama as a zombie
[28:21.000 --> 28:28.000]  this is on KMTV the folks there have a sign with Obama as a zombie on an outhouse
[28:28.000 --> 28:35.000]  saying presidential library and so the Secret Service has arrived in Norfolk Nebraska
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000]  and it was also in a parade float on 4th of July so and they're saying
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  where the Secret Service and the DOJ we're here to see of your racist not if you're threatening the president
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.000]  which has been an intimidation factor they've been using people don't actually threaten the president
[28:49.000 --> 28:56.000]  now it's we're here to see what you have to say again anti free speech garbage
[28:56.000 --> 29:02.000]  absolute anti free speech garbage that's why you use it or lose it you don't back off from this intimidation
[29:02.000 --> 29:08.000]  you triple down you don't double down you quadruple down you quadruple down again
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.000]  all over the country they try to arrest you for lemonade stands double triple down support lemonade stands
[29:13.000 --> 29:24.000]  watermelon stands you name it they try to arrest people for all sorts of garbage you have to then stand up against it
[29:24.000 --> 29:30.000]  all over the country they're trying to shut down farmers market markets you shop with them
[29:30.000 --> 29:36.000]  there's a reason they want all of this stuff banned they want shocking the sidewalk ban
[29:36.000 --> 29:41.000]  when it's clearly free speech protected because they want you to stay in your house and shut up
[29:41.000 --> 29:45.000]  they got judges in Dallas going door-to-door saying don't protest we're bringing illegals in
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.000]  or we might arrest you it's pure thug mafia tactics of total evil
[29:49.000 --> 29:53.000]  we're on the march the empires on the march that's why they're trying to shut us down
[29:53.000 --> 29:56.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.000 --> 30:03.000]  city of Austin tap water versus filtered city of Austin tap water
[30:03.000 --> 30:06.000]  I didn't I taste dirt in it God knows what's in this
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.000]  these people just sampled city of Austin tap water straight from the faucet
[30:10.000 --> 30:16.000]  next we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a crow pure g2.0 filtration system

[30:20.000 --> 30:26.000]  most tap water contains added substances like fluoride chlorine glyphosate and many others

[30:33.000 --> 30:36.000]  it tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're in tap water

[31:04.000 --> 31:10.000]  get healthy and detoxify most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world
[31:10.000 --> 31:15.000]  iodine is key to so many of the body's functions especially the thyroid

[34:53.000 --> 34:56.000]  alright sorry folks
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.000]  it's the last time you will
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.000]  alright ladies and gentlemen again thank you for joining us on this
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  Friday Worldwide Transmission 7-11
[35:09.000 --> 35:14.000]  the 11th day already of February 2014
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  again I'm your host Alex Jones we're one of Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.000]  keeps things Staff Sergeant because he first had military reporting for us part time
[35:22.000 --> 35:26.000]  so when you do military reporting you say that their former Staff Sergeant retired
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  that's a standard way to do it now that he reports on everything for us and works here
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.000]  full time does a great job with the rest of the crew I just keep calling him Staff Sergeant
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.000]  because you're not supposed to do that in standard journalism but I keep doing it
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.000]  but talk radio is a little different there's a lot of former cops and military that have radio shows
[35:41.000 --> 35:45.000]  and they'll call them by their name like Sergeant Sam Cox
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  locally on the radio so it's kind of a choice thing but I tell the crew stop using it
[35:49.000 --> 35:53.000]  because it's not the standard journalism thing to do and then I keep doing it
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  we're gonna go to Joe Biggs here in just a minute
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  I wanted to do a war stories deal like Oliver North does
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  because of all his interesting photos and videos he's shown me
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.000]  and his letters and all the rest of it some of the stuff Esquire wrote about
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.000]  he saw some very interesting combat not a lot of people have been in like knife fights
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.000]  with Al Qaeda and stuff and he never told those stories to the public
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  and I've seen his commendations and stuff and Esquire wrote about some of it
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  we need him to tell those stories and then to talk to other vets and get their stories
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.000]  just because the average person has no idea the type of stuff that went on in Afghanistan
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  and Iraq and more we're gonna go to him in Marietta, California
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  in a moment let's go through these articles right here
[36:36.000 --> 36:42.000]  Border Patrol Agent US government completing the smuggle cycle
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  I want to go to that but first I want to go to Sheila Jackson Lee
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.000]  her comment is almost as dumb as the congressman that thinks that islands float
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  that Guam floats but it's not that dumb that's in its own universe
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.000]  but this is just pure old-fashioned Bravo Sierra
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  saying that our border is under control but in a way it is like Obama said
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  when he said I have intimate knowledge everything is going as I have
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  seen it quoting Emperor Palpatine because they've
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  ended the border unless you're a citizen trying to come back
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  or somebody with skills trying to come in but if you're ready to sign up for
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.000]  welfare and get a voter ID card and pull the lever to take my guns baby
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  you have got a gravy train at least for a while till everything collapses
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  but what do you know you're already leaving a place that collapsed so I don't even blame those people
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  but it'd be like having somebody jump off of Empire State's
[37:34.000 --> 37:38.000]  building and land on you you may not dislike the person it's gonna kill you
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  their weight's gonna smash you
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  use the analogy of water they use in those high powered water hoses to strip
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  mine up close it'll cut a person in half I'm not against water
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  I'm not aguaphobic
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  like I'm pedophobic
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  that's the new thing if you're against raping children you're a pedophob
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  that's serious mainstream news now
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  so come on hand your kids over racist
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  you think I'm joking? the group that runs things is gonna have
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.000]  killing old people and killing babies up to age three it's already being legalized in Europe
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.000]  okay this is a plan they're following no matter how radical and crazy I sound
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  even when I try to engage in satire it's actually going on
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  okay it's so over the top that
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  there's the London telegraph headline Australian judge says incest may longer be taboo
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  and in the ruling he went on to say pedophilia is no big deal
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  that's international news right now
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  what do you think is going on with all these kids being exploited being wards of the state
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  and names it's just guaranteed they're having the organs harvested
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  guaranteed they're going into the sex trade in fact it's already coming out guaranteed we said
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  months ago they're mules it's been confirmed now by even the DEA they're mules
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  I mean this is a total takeover
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  so let's go to Sheila Jackson Lee and then to
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  Joe Biggs here it is I disagree that our border
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  is in a devastating condition our border
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.000]  is doing their job you think the border is secure
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  Craig here's what I think that you have not looked to this
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  issue except for this rising migration
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  Congresswoman this is a very simple question yes or no
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.000]  are our borders secure
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  I think our border with now 21,000 Border Patrol agents is under control
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  we need to give them more resources more equipment and they can
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  plan to have more support as it relates to the increasing of those numbers
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.000]  that may come through the supplemental there's a large amount of money
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  now they want more border patrol which is a red carpet
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.000]  assembly line conveyor belt for the illegal
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  aliens you understand they are the delivery conduit
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  they load them on the buses under any name they want
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.000]  and bust them all over including 36,000 aggravated felons in one month
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  this year now they want
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.000]  3.7 billion AP reports let's go to Border Patrol
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  agent talking about
[40:22.000 --> 40:26.000]  this on Fox News this is Hector Garza
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  with Sean Hannity last night
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  okay this is a fact here it is when you say that the federal government's aiding
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  in a bedding sounds like
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  it's supposed to be protecting this border you mean aiding in a bedding
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  what do you mean specifically actually what's happening is that the federal government
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  is actually completing the smuggling cycle by having a parent sending their
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.000]  child to the US border having them smuggled
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  that is only part of the smuggling cycle then it comes
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  the federal government says we apprehend them we process these illegal aliens and then we release them
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  to their family members in the US we just completed that smuggling cycle
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  why would anybody want to hire a smuggler when the US government is actually
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  doing it for free so in other words when your agents put their lives on the line
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  and they're sometimes a violent incident and they do their
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  job those people that broke the law they still end up staying
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  yeah that's what I've been trying to explain the whole time okay this is so simple it's hard to understand
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  even for me it's so over the top and they've got a
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  psychological name for that I forget where you just were overwhelmed during the headlights
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  so ridiculous 2 plus 2 equals 5
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  you didn't build your business you can keep your doctor when you can't we're not coming from your guns
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  we just want to ban them I mean it's this overthrow of reality that we see
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  going on right now where you've got Latin America
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  700 million people in collapse and they're advertising
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  99% are being released if you can get here the board patrol is going to give you
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  a voucher to deliver you to a church group the Catholic church you name it
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  we're going to put you in the Democrats to turn all the states blue
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  and then we had earlier this year of the Veritas project with O'Keeffe
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  got the video at like 5 different meetings in Texas
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  in Austin where Sheila Jackson was speaking from in that video clip
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  and the articles they go we're opening the borders we're going to take over within 5 years
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  I mean it's game over folks they're going to ban
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.000]  our guns you understand I mean they're not playing
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  games with Battleground Texas people better get that through their
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.000]  head and Rick Perry's going I think Obama cares
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  I've got a clip coming up if we talk to Biggs he wants to control
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  the border we need to get people down on
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  the border and meanwhile they're 100 miles back on purpose to open the border up
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  there it is blue state blues fleeing Democrats will turn
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  Texas blue that's the plan like Locust
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  they destroy California they destroy Michigan
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.000]  they destroy New York they destroy all the and then they come here where we had lower taxes
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.000]  and I mean let me tell you they'll walk up and you got 3 kids in a grocery store and so you shouldn't have
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.000]  3 kids that's happening to my wife probably 5 times in all foods and you're like
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  you're joking right these Californians will walk up in the gym and tell you
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  not talk too loud if you're talking about the 2nd amendment or how you don't like Obama
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  they'll walk over go please be quiet talk about the traffic being real bad in the gym
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  the other day and the lady walks over and goes stop talking louder I'll complain
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  I was like are you kidding me I mean they're coming
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.000]  they rule they rule everything their weakness
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.000]  their evil their scuminess is unstoppable
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.000]  you can go into Acron on video and say I want to run child sex slaves from
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  Mexico and they'll say we're ready to run the op right now they're savage
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  they're in control they launder the money they dominate
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.000]  it's organized crime period they're going to bring
[43:58.000 --> 44:02.000]  the whole country down fast
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.000]  alright let's go to Joe Biggs and Joe Jennings running camera doing a great
[44:06.000 --> 44:10.000]  job in front of the Civic Center where the Communists and Socialists showed up 2 days ago we had
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  video admitting as Clouder and Bevin we've got an incredible report coming up the next segment Joe filed
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.000]  a never before seen interview nobody's gotten this with
[44:18.000 --> 44:22.000]  the brown berets of Mecha and of La Raza
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.000]  that interview is up on infowars.com but Joe Biggs thank you
[44:26.000 --> 44:30.000]  for being out there you're flying back tonight you've done a yeoman's job tell us what you've seen
[44:30.000 --> 44:34.000]  Joe Biggs here in Temecula Southern California
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.000]  it's a neighboring city right beside Marietta where
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  yesterday they had a very large victory over the Obama
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  administration where they stood up and said no you're not going to bring those
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  people in here you're not going to bring those illegal alien kids into our town
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  and make us go bankrupt and then we got
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.000]  assaulted like always by a fed the feds came after
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.000]  support patrol the local police and then we decided to go up against
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.000]  La Raza and talk to them now I haven't heard what happened you got assaulted
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.000]  I mean exactly what happened
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  I didn't mean to say assaulted they came up to us and confronted us I use the wrong word
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.000]  my bad but we know what we know what happened to folks that did the wrong
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  thing in Iraq and Afghanistan but anyways let's continue on now
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.000]  what else has happened well yesterday
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.000]  towards the end of the protest we were hanging out out there we saw a couple of Mexican flags
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  waving off in the distance and I noticed that no one was down there with them
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  and when we got a closer look you could see the brown shirts the dark pants and the
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.000]  berets and I said hey that's La Raza we need to go walk down there and see you know let's go
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.000]  talk to them no one else was doing it everybody was standing off from a distance and taking pictures
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.000]  so we hopped in our vehicle and drove down there and I simply got out and I said
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.000]  hey can I conduct an interview with you and he said no so I put the microphone
[45:54.000 --> 45:58.000]  down and I walked over and just started having a conversation with
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.000]  the guy and after a minute he started to ease up and got a bit more comfortable
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.000]  and Joe Jennings came around and started filming you know no one else
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  has ever had an on-camera interview with La Raza before this is an exclusive
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  interview with them and the funny thing if you notice
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  there's a particular group of brown beret admittedly communist group
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  racist group doesn't like anybody that isn't Hispanic
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  and you were able to talk to them at interviewsoninfowars.com
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  tell us about some of the things they said
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  well some of the things they were saying is that they said there should be no borders
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  just like the socialists said at the rally the other day they don't think there should be any borders whatsoever
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  at all and one of the things was too is when I walked up to him he looked at me and he goes
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  I said yeah I've seen you guys before
[46:46.000 --> 46:50.000]  he's like yeah I'm not really a fan of your views and behind him one of the ladies that was a member of
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  La Raza or a supporter I would say was sitting there
[46:54.000 --> 46:58.000]  filming me and calling me the evil media
[46:58.000 --> 47:02.000]  pretty ridiculous you know the globalists want open borders where none of us have any
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.000]  rights and we're all slaves under global corporate domination they're the ones through the Ford Foundation
[47:06.000 --> 47:10.000]  openly funding La Raza and Mecha but I bet those idiots
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.000]  that follow it like the mindless Klan that doesn't know they're federally handled
[47:14.000 --> 47:18.000]  I bet they have no idea even about that
[47:18.000 --> 47:22.000]  well the funny thing was though is when he talked to me he seemed very calm and he
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  all I did was talk about the kids he just wanted to talk about how the only reason they're there is for the kids
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.000]  and I asked him why are you out here today sir and he said I want to make sure that none of my people
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.000]  who are out here get harmed and we just want to make sure everything is fair but there was no one
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.000]  else at the protest supporting La Raza at all there was no pro-amnesty people
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  out there it was just them on both sides of the road with flags waving in the air
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  standing out there with their arms behind their back at parade rest there was five
[47:46.000 --> 47:50.000]  of them on one side but as soon as this Hispanic
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  journalist walked up after I got done with mine and he called him the Mexican
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.000]  KKK that's when he flipped and started calling him a traitor and they started
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  flipping off like flipping them off giving them the bird and just going crazy on him
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  and you got all that on tape yes in front of me they're very cool
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  and calm no wait have you put out the flipping have you put the flipping out yet on
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  on online yes at the very end okay
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  because I was busy this morning I watched about 80% of it I can't watch all these videos I just
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  saw most of it no I wanted to play it so it's at the end because I haven't even seen all this
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  shit folks so we're playing that soon we should put that out on its own with
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  Darren McBrain's video he's putting out today showing their flipping out at the
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  first and then all the past examples of them flipping out I'm going to skip this
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  network break because this is so important what else are you going to
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  do today before you guys come back to Austin well we're thinking about going
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  up to LA where they have been dropping off a lot of these kids
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  when they bypassed Marietta I guess they decided to take the
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.000]  illegal immigrant children to the one of the facilities in LA
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.000]  where all the pro-amnesty supporters come out of so now I guess it's their problem to deal with
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  so we're going to go out there and see if we can find some of these spots go to some of the
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  facilities and see if we can figure out where these kids are getting dropped off in LA
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  Alright well Joe Biggs and Joe Jennings great job guys hustle up to LA
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  get on your plane get back to Austin and hopefully we can
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  debrief you guys over some cold ones this weekend
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  That sounds like a good idea Alex Alright gentlemen thank you so much good job
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  Alright there goes Joe Biggs and Joe Jennings on the board we've got a bunch of our team out there
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  Jakari Jackson, Kit Daniels, Josh Owens and others
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  and I want to get to this report but first this is the CEO of
[49:34.000 --> 49:38.000]  the race the clan ought to change their name to that just
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  or the storm front could just call it the race it's like but that would be racist
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  not I mean this is not racist when these guys do it
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.000]  and we have a bunch of clips we haven't aired yet going back over years of La Raza and Mecha
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  Shang you know go back to Europe we're going to kill you all the rest of it but first here's the CEO
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  just yesterday I guess on MSNBC
[49:58.000 --> 50:02.000]  she's also been on CNN saying that it's racist
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  should protest the end of the border completely and third world
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  hell pits that we don't want to live in collapsing into us here it is
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.000]  and CEO of the council of La Raza Janet
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.000]  let me start with you I am sure
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  when you see the footage of these furious crowds yelling
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  go home go home I think bring
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  I found it to be a shameful moment to be an American to see people treated like that
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  people who are seeking a new day here in America what is also
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.000]  is that these people apparently are able to dictate deportation policy in so far as
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.000]  150 anti-immigrant protestors turn these buses around
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  what was your reaction to it well I agree with you
[50:46.000 --> 50:50.000]  Alex that it is appalled and outrageous to see
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  that this group of extremists
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.000]  and really landing themselves as vigilantes
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  were able to control an outcome
[51:02.000 --> 51:06.000]  alright guys I mean the issue is the extremists are the ones
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  getting rid of the border but you can't go to Mexico
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.000]  or Guatemala I mean you're illegal though they throw you in prison on record
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.000]  for years in some cases usually six months hard labor look up Mexico as the most
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  draconian immigration laws in this hemisphere and then she says with a straight face
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.000]  I'm so ashamed to be American it's all about lecturing us
[51:26.000 --> 51:30.000]  see in 2 plus 2 equals 5 don't say bossy it's like shut up
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  what tell me what to do you cult member you freak
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  I don't live in North Korea witch your spell is broken on me
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  I'm not under your political correctness
[51:42.000 --> 51:46.000]  and by the way almost every Hispanic American I talk to doesn't want open borders they're not suicidal
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  there's a reason everybody's fleeing up here and America
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.000]  is good now I mean let me tell you something I'm a grown man
[51:54.000 --> 51:58.000]  Guatemala is scary
[51:58.000 --> 52:02.000]  El Salvador, Venezuela it's scary
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.000]  seeking a new day a new day to come
[52:06.000 --> 52:10.000]  ban my guns now let's go to Joe Biggs interview
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.000]  with the brown berets of Mecha and Laraza they're the
[52:14.000 --> 52:18.000]  paramilitary force and they fittingly they've been doing this for 30 years they wear
[52:18.000 --> 52:22.000]  brown uniforms and brown berets
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.000]  let's go ahead and go they actually wear
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.000]  Ernst Rome SA outfits for those that don't and they're not Nazis
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  they're more communists but I wonder why they chose fascist uniforms here they are
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.000]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com and Murrieta
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.000]  California now right behind me on both sides of the road
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  we have Laraz's soldiers staining their little guard waving
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  Mexican flags back and forth I want to go down there and talk to them and see what
[52:50.000 --> 52:54.000]  they have to say here what their views are on this matter let's go down
[52:54.000 --> 52:58.000]  there and take a look
[52:58.000 --> 53:02.000]  what is your stand on how to deal with it
[53:02.000 --> 53:06.000]  I don't know the answers
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.000]  even if they have whatever
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.000]  it's not like they made the choice to you
[53:14.000 --> 53:18.000]  they already got caught
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  what's your stand on the border then do you think we should have more as well
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  let me have a look
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  so it's just the kids
[53:30.000 --> 53:34.000]  whatever my personal opinion
[53:34.000 --> 53:38.000]  okay here's my next question then so are you guys going to take in these kids
[53:38.000 --> 53:42.000]  as well
[53:42.000 --> 53:46.000]  if they release them I'll tell you right now
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.000]  but I wanted the prime to see a meeting yesterday
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  at town hall and the diocese said that they will be releasing them into the city
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  so would you take them into the home
[53:58.000 --> 54:02.000]  there's a lot of people who say they want to take these kids in but they want to do it
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  you've got Nancy Pelosi and all these people who say they're going to bring kids
[54:06.000 --> 54:10.000]  those people are doing it and making big statements
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.000]  and they're not doing it
[54:14.000 --> 54:18.000]  and I'll tell you right now
[54:18.000 --> 54:22.000]  from what I heard last night
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.000]  I don't know
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.000]  we don't know about
[54:30.000 --> 54:34.000]  we're going to pause that
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.000]  and then come back to more of it where the confrontation begins
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.000]  out there so that's why it sounds like that
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.000]  but the full interview is up on infowars.com I'll put a shorter version out with the meat of it
[54:46.000 --> 54:50.000]  but that's going to come up in a moment
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.000]  but again yeah they can come to his house then be put on democratic party welfare
[54:54.000 --> 54:58.000]  taxpayer welfare and then become wards of the state
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.000]  and then the illegals get a job but they also get the welfare
[55:02.000 --> 55:06.000]  just like Walmart now tells their employees go get welfare as well
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.000]  they work at Walmart and you make so little
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.000]  Walmart's public about this two years ago that you then go get welfare on top of it
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.000]  so see that's what they really want the new model is you've got to work and be on welfare
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.000]  to live the jobs won't pay enough to live with the regulations of bureaucracy
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  from the cost of living
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  so you've got to work and be a slave to them as well on government payroll
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  pure exploitation we're going to play that clip where they blow up here at the end
[55:34.000 --> 55:38.000]  when somebody else comes over and starts talking to them but before we go any further

[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  true face of La Raza and Metia with the video we've put together from
[57:34.000 --> 58:02.000]  over the years but here it is.
[58:02.000 --> 58:26.000]  We're going to go to Brighton come back with a rest.
[58:26.000 --> 58:30.000]  This guy in Spanish is telling him you know basically you're out of your mind and they start calling him a traitor and stuff.
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.000]  Alright we'll be right back. Stay with us ladies and gentlemen.
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  The guy's like why do you want to collapse both countries into each other?
[58:38.000 --> 58:42.000]  They're like how dare you traitor that's coming up.
[58:42.000 --> 58:46.000]  It's a lot clearer when you see the video on infowars.com
[58:46.000 --> 59:12.000]  Super windy out there. Stay with us the second hour coming up.

[59:42.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  Moan Lombay you can take my gun from my cold dead aunt.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  Well so does he.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  And now live from Austin Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  That is not what a penis looks like. It's a clip of cells at 12 weeks. It does not look like that. It's a clip of mother f***ing cells. No hands are shown through that time.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  It's a white f***ing friend which raises f***ing mail that doesn't stand for women's rights.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  Is that a demonic Easter bunny that lady?
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  Why am I saying Peter? F*** it!
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  Will Riley! Riley! Riley! Riley! Hold on a second. F*** it!
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  We are calling the police ma'am.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  You are a f***ing white male.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  I'm calling the police right now.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  What you are is a racist mother f***ing as well. How dare you f***ing do this kind of f***ing asshole!
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  Ron to you by Burger King.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  We need your tape. We will return this to the police.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  Go ahead. Go right the f***ing gun ahead. You f***ing sexist, misogynist of mother f***ings. That is all you are. You don't give a s*** about women. You don't give a s*** about life.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  We are going to come back from break and talk to the head of the group whose group recorded this actual goblin troll attacking pro-lifers and their signs.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  But before we go to break, I want to air Leigh Ann McAdoo's report from yesterday where Obama was at the tiny theater compared to his normal venues.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  People there worshipping Obama, we decided to go out and find out exactly what they thought. Here is her report.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  I'm standing in front of the Paramount Theater here in Austin, Texas where his heinous President Barack Obama is headlining.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  Now in response to his critics who wondered why he wasn't at the border while he's in Texas, he said a visit to the border would be nothing more than theater.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  And of course the irony is not lost on the fact that his name is on the marquee at the Paramount Theater as he's here to address his adoring fans.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  Well, we're going to go check with some of these people, some of whom have waited since midnight trying to get tickets to see the big show.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  Are you super pumped to be in the presence of the Lord and Savior Obama?
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  Yeah, yeah. You know, it's not every day you see the President.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  Yes, I am, but I'm hoping to get them in too. I really want her to go. I think she'll appreciate it.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  No, I think it's more about just seeing the President. I've never seen a President before.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  How do you feel knowing that you might still not make it past the rope?
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Well, if that happens, we would not be very happy.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  It'll be a waste of time, but at least it's worth watching.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  We heard people actually stayed overnight.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  Were they overnight?
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  Yeah, they did.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  What about you guys?
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  We did that actually.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  You were there. What time did you get there?
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  Midnight.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  Yeah, right there.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  Look how helpless they are.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  They could start doling out tickets at 8.30.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  So you guys are visiting from Europe?
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  Exactly, from Switzerland.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  So this is super exciting for you to go see the President of the United States of America?
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  Yes, indeed.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  Kinda.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  I gotta warn you, I work at Fox around the corner.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  Okay.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  Well, so if you had one shot to ask the President anything, let's just say he goes all mavericky and rogue
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  and lets people ask him a question. What would be your one question?
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  I'd like to do something about student loan debt.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  I would probably just go mute and not be able to talk.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  Oh my gosh.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  Is he going for third term?
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  I know he can't, but...
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  Would you like him to? Would you vote for him?
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  Yes, I would. Yes, I would. I would vote for him.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  It'd be a toss between Clinton and Obama.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  Oh yeah.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  I think I would be asking him about what he plans to do for the next two years of his presidency.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  How is he going to handle the issues that we're seeing with the gridlock?
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  He's doing the best he can obviously, but there has to be a breaking point.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  Why are you continuing the drone, Roy?
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  Wow, good question.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  He's crying to sweat America's throat when he's out there.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  Do you want to hang out with the President later?
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  Yes.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  How long have you been staying in Hawaii, probably?
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  How long? Are you into Hawaii?
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  Yeah.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  Do you think it's weird that people like hail the President as sort of a kingly figure?
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  It is something you have to get used to. I mean, I can understand it if he's such an important person for the state.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  Full report up on infowars.com.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  Yeah, I mean Kim Jong-un. They treat him like a king too, Queen of England. Why not?
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  Worshipping.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  I'm just going to talk about the statistics that 6 million Americans live with pets.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  They're allergic to as well. When I began to research these statistics,
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleans is here,
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.640]  All exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.080]  I can taste dirt in it.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.400]  God knows what's in this.
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:06.880]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.960]  Next we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the Pro Pure G2.0 filtration
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.960]  system.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.960]  Now one is better.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.960]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.960]  Yep.
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:16.960]  I know what good water tastes like.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:17.960]  It's good water.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:22.400]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.400]  others.
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:27.520]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.120]  tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:33.120]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:39.080]  The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.080]  tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.560]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.560]  It's good water.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.560]  Refreshing.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.560]  It's good.

[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.280]  In the near future.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:05.280]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.280]  Alert.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.280]  Security.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.280]  Alert.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.280]  This is Homeland Security.

[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.280]  Media operation.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:18.000]  You've got the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.760]  I'm directed to discredit Alex Jones.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.280]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.760]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.760]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.760]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.760]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.760]  They are never going to stop.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:39.760]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.360]  written planet TV.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.440]  You've got a censor eye on the enemy.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.160]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.160]  Get electrically.
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.160]  It's begun.
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:02.680]  You can fail it.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:09.240]  From his central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:16.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:30.120]  Well, the question is being asked, is a nation without borders a nation?
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.120]  No.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.480]  It's a conquered sector of the globalist.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:39.480]  And Perry saying we need to secure the border with a show of force.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:44.520]  The border patrol in ISIS under Obama globalist control, they're a red carpet to bust the
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.240]  people in and give them free money.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.120]  I mean, that's on record.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.640]  The border patrol has been saying that for almost four months.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.200]  We documented it almost four weeks ago with Drudge.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:01.680]  It's incontrovertible now that the government is completing the smuggling process as a border
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:06.120]  patrol agent said last night, Hector Garza on national television.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.440]  That video is on info wars.com.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:16.480]  Multi-billionaires, Buffett, Gates, Andelson unite for amnesty to break the country to
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:19.080]  drive down the wages to bring in the voting block.
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:22.640]  They all give money to anti-gun groups.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.280]  They all give money to globalist groups.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.440]  They're the globalists.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.440]  Understand that?
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.880]  Illegals to get lawyers, schools and healthcare.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:33.800]  This is the government doing what the vets don't get with outside groups.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:37.160]  Again, they're just being used and exploited.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.160]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.680]  They're still incredibly dangerous.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:46.080]  Fed spending 1000 per bed, populist immigration backlash, armed militia sets up Texas command
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.240]  center, fight for national sovereignty.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.240]  90,000 to cross by end of summer.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.800]  Folks, it's 90,000 a week.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.880]  Trump, this influx is killing the country.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.600]  It is because they go right on welfare, folks.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.680]  Obama meets with immigration hecklers.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.040]  I'm on your side, man.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.040]  Michelle O, we have to keep fighting as hard as we can.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:11.360]  Perry, president didn't know border patrol was stationed 40 miles from the border.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360]  That's right.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.760]  It's stationed 100 miles.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:17.400]  Deportation agency will be broken months.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:21.120]  White House stands by claiming that border security is stronger than ever.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.280]  Adulty legals posing as children to enroll in high school.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:28.320]  Yeah, I mean, because they can have any ID they want.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.480]  They can have any ID they want.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.880]  Any ID they want.
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.880]  And they just get in.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:42.160]  Meanwhile, if you have a float with Obama, presidential library is an outhouse.
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.040]  And as Obama is a zombie, the feds come investigating your racism.
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:50.360]  They're not even claiming it's a threat to the criminal president, who I want nothing
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.720]  bad to happen to.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:11:04.360]  No, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, this is the insanity of the country that we have now
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.600]  reached here.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:11.960]  Document show NSA knew London Guardian was pressured to destroy Snowden documents.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:18.120]  That's breaking on info wars dot com right now.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:24.000]  And in other news on info wars dot com, let me just pull it up on the computer.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.720]  My little one's not working.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.720]  Document show NSA knew London Guardian.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:34.160]  Again, as I just mentioned, was pressured to destroy Snowden files.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.520]  And of course, the parliament was in a secret deal without law to allow all the illegal
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.520]  spying.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.600]  See, it's all just a gang of crooks, just like our government.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.320]  First lady at Guatemala, illegal immigrants, not refugees escaping violence.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.200]  Ladies investigate racist depiction of Obama's a zombie.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.200]  Just mentioned that.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:55.400]  La Raza members vowed to 80 legal immigrants in Marietta, man arrested for asking cops
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.400]  a question.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.880]  Sheila, dumb as a bag of hammers, Jackson Lee declared border under control.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.040]  Well, it is actually under control.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:09.280]  NSA collects it all knows it all and is actually the Stasi model says more major whistleblowers.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.280]  Yeah.
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:15.600]  And it's all to secure the criminal takeover if Obama actually cared about Homeland security
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.600]  or Islamic terror.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.840]  He would seal the border now is another article.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:24.080]  Well, of course they run the radical Islamic terror and Obama is incredibly popular in
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.560]  Saudi Arabia with Wahhabist groups.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.600]  That's in a poll out today.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.600]  Not just with Muslims.
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:37.720]  His approval rating is high with Muslims, but with the most extremist of groups.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.000]  There's 7 billion people outside the country.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.600]  The globalist our government will team up with them to come in here.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.440]  I don't care who they are.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.520]  They'll hire the former Stasi to set up stuff and come takeover and set up on land security.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.520]  Marcus Wolf.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:54.040]  They'll bring in radical Muslims that he stabilized things and blow stuff up and then
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.200]  take our rights.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.040]  They'll bring in unlimited illegals from Latin America to collapse things.
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.160]  This is a takeover.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.760]  Now joining us is someone taking action against the evil.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:09.880]  And that's Mark Harrington, the executive director of created equal.net a pro life group.
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:17.040]  And the article is up on info wars.com craved abortion advocate attacks peaceful pro lifers.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.880]  We put this story out yesterday and we put out a beeped version of it, but there's so
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.160]  much cussing you can hardly understand it when you beep it and his team out on the ground
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:31.520]  that puts up signs all over the region showing the aborted babies was attacked physically
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.520]  by her.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:38.120]  We never found out the video was she arrested at the end of it and she seems very unstable
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:44.200]  wearing her Burger King uniform as she calls them racist and anti women.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:49.120]  And of course that abortion where we looked it up mainly kills Hispanics and black babies.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:54.040]  So if you're against killing blacks and Hispanics, you are an anti woman racist.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:59.440]  And when she says that she then attacks after invoking the battle creed that you know makes
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:05.000]  her somebody and you nobody, which is really a form of racism itself or tribalism to dehumanize
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.240]  you as a racist before then attacking you.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.960]  She is the model of Gloria Steinem's destruction of women to marry the state.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.440]  So joining us is Mark Harrington Mark.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.920]  Thank you for all you're doing.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.200]  I want you to tell us about created equal on the organization.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:25.640]  But before you do that, break down what you're doing on the ground there and this video
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:30.800]  has now been aired on national television all over the place where this obviously disturbed
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.600]  woman attacks your people.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:39.680]  Yeah, well on Wednesday Alex, we commonly go out to our state house here on the public
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:46.520]  sidewalk and we set up these abortion victim photos and engage in dialogue with people.
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:52.520]  And as you can imagine, you know, some people come along and can't contain themselves and
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:57.960]  they get argumentative and the thing is we're trained though to kind of diffuse that.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.840]  But in this case, as you can tell by the video, this woman wasn't just argumentative.
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.720]  She was verbally abusive.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.400]  Then she destroyed our signs.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.880]  Then she proceeded to assault one of our staff members.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.120]  We contacted the police.
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.320]  They came.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:19.120]  They cited her for criminal damaging and assault and she's going to be arraigned next Wednesday.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:25.160]  Again, her attempt to shut down your free speech of real authoritarianism.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:30.000]  This is what we saw in Germany in the build up to the 40s and I'm not just making that
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.960]  parallel lightly, intimidating people's speech is the final domino to fall when a society
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:42.200]  collapses into tyranny and more and more the left are avowed authoritarians.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:46.400]  We see the quotes of if you're in the Tea Party, we want you in body bags and lowest
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.600]  learner going after pro-life groups with the IRS.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.280]  I mean, do you agree that this is real authoritarianism?
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.240]  No question about it.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:58.400]  If you watch the interview with this young lady, she tries to say that the First Amendment
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:02.160]  protected her right to damage our equipment and assault us.
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.840]  I mean, that's her understanding.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.240]  Now, she's getting that from somewhere.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:10.960]  As you can imagine, it's either in public school she attended, from her parents.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:11.960]  Who knows?
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:18.520]  But it's coming from a culture that accepts violence as a way of dealing with problems
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.800]  like abortion.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.000]  This is the problem, we're seeing this more and more often as we go out in the streets.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.800]  I tell our people that we understand the risks are involved and it's probably going to increase.
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:35.880]  We wear cameras at a run-in continuously and we're going to be certain if it does happen
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:39.800]  we're going to capture on film because we have to be our own police department, our
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:43.440]  own media people, because the media generally isn't going to cover us.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.360]  I was actually surprised that they did in this case.
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.680]  So we've got to do the work for the media.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:52.400]  We've got to do the work for law enforcement who generally want to ignore this kind of
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.400]  thing.
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:59.680]  Well, I tell you, we saw the latest video with the lady having the abortion saying she loves
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:00.680]  the baby.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.280]  It's loving what she's doing.
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.440]  That sickened everyone.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.920]  The polls are really swinging against these people.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.040]  Is that why you think they're freaking out and getting so violent?
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.040]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.400]  I think it has something to do with public opinion shifting towards our position.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.400]  But I also think we're just living in a lawless age.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.600]  Look who's in the White House.
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:26.360]  From the top down, it's okay, it's permissible to do whatever it takes.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:30.520]  The end justifies the means and that includes violence to get what you want.
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:36.360]  And I think these young people are just being taught that, is that it's acceptable.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.520]  She didn't think twice about it.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:41.200]  In fact, when she was arrested, she said, come and get me and she put her hands out,
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.200]  ready to be arrested.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.840]  I mean, it's like a badge of honor for her.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:50.520]  So I just think we're seeing that more and more and I think it has something to do generally
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:54.160]  with just the culture, the Obama administration and others.
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.160]  People are victims.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.080]  Everybody's a victim.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.080]  Nobody's a victimizer.
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:04.800]  In fact, I've had people trying to defend this woman as the victim and I'm saying, well,
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:05.800]  wait a minute.
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:06.880]  Who are the people that got victimized here?
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:07.880]  It was us.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.560]  We were out there exercising our first amendment rights.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:15.760]  She comes, destroys our stuff, assaults us and then tries to say that she had the right
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:16.760]  to do it.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:23.600]  Well, she seemed to almost be in a panicked, manic frenzy and most people I run into now
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:30.560]  in Austin, Texas, where I live, are formerly Democrats and liberals and are now what I'd
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.760]  call libertarians and are waking up that there's problems with Republicans, but that the Democrats
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:38.880]  are really becoming tyrannical.
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:42.720]  But when I do run into a Democrat now that doesn't like me, they'll walk over maybe once
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.080]  a month down a restaurant or on the street and slap me on the back of the head, knock
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:54.600]  my glass over, start booing me in front of my family in like a public peer pressure thing
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:58.800]  where they really seem to be desperate right now that they've bedded everything on this
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.240]  weird culture of statism.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.920]  It's not delivering for them and they seem desperate.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.720]  I think you're right.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:08.560]  I mean, we're seeing that on college campuses across the country.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:11.280]  That was just in California.
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:17.440]  We did the same very type of outreach on Venice Beach of all places, if you could imagine.
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:26.080]  And it's just amazing the acceptability of people who come up to you and curse you out.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:30.720]  And you've got to understand, Alex, I lead a group of young people.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.720]  These are students.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:35.280]  Some of them are 15, 16.
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.160]  We had a couple that are 13 and 14.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.720]  We got adults, supposedly, coming up, you know, giving the middle digit right in their
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:46.480]  face, screaming at the top of their lungs, you know, at these young people.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.400]  And it's just, it's amazing that anybody would do that.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.520]  Well, you're standing up for people that are under violent attacks.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.600]  So it just really illustrates how violent these people are.

[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:19.520]  Former Congressman Ron Paul to get into the economy, the state of the world, the borders,
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.800]  all of it is coming up.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:26.640]  Max Kaiser on the economy and the acceleration away from the dollar.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:34.200]  Mark Harrington who heads up the organization CreditEqual.net that puts up signs around
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.200]  the region.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.200]  I know it works for other groups to do it around the country showing what a baby looks
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:41.560]  like even in the first dry master.
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:46.680]  And look folks, the issue here is this is being used as birth control, 53 million Americans
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:51.280]  have been killed and now they're trying to kill babies up to age three and fantasize.
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:55.160]  Now judges are saying, you know, have sex with your kids, that's in the news today, Australian
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:59.920]  judge says incest may no longer be taboo, the pedophilia is okay.
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:02.600]  This is part of a deranged takeover.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:09.400]  I've studied these people and it's very, very dangerous and it's part of an overall
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.760]  just anti-human system.
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:16.560]  Look at MSNBC saying recently in promos, your children belong to the state and you didn't
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.560]  build your business.
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:23.000]  And it seems so alien to those of us that are somewhat normal.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.240]  They need it to be alien.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:25.400]  They are nudging us.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:26.560]  They are preparing us.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.760]  Do you agree with that statement or would you like to augment that Mark Harrington?
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:32.200]  No, I agree pretty much.
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:37.680]  You know, if you watch this video of this woman, she talks about us being misogynistic
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:42.920]  and all of this that would, you know, patriarchy and all of them, she wants to stop patriarchy
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:43.920]  and all that.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:50.040]  And the foundation of a lot of this is they just hate men, bottom line, they hate men.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:53.000]  In fact, Alex, you're in Texas there.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:00.560]  There's going to be a group of radical pro-abortion activists coming through the state there
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:05.960]  on what they're calling this stop patriarchy tour and they're going to come to Austin,
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:06.960]  in fact.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:07.960]  Oh yeah.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.200]  This is the same place where they chanted Hail Satan last year when pro-livers were
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:17.000]  praying and it was literally hundreds of women spontaneously sticking their tongues
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.920]  out going, I love you Satan, Hail Satan, I love abortion.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:25.800]  And really it gets down to the fact that they're getting off on the human sacrifice.
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:26.800]  They are.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:27.800]  And they're coming to Texas.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:30.160]  There's going to be a five-city tour.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.480]  And we're actually going to come down there and oppose them.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:36.200]  So this is going to be sometime in August, they don't have the dates yet, but these are
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.080]  the radical pro-abortion groups.
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:44.080]  I mean, they're running this, you know, their advocacy, this movement on the other side
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.080]  and really the foundation of the system.
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.080]  By the way, that sounds crazy.
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:51.440]  In fact, I want to invite you to Austin, to the studio, sir, we should come down here.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:56.040]  I'm sure you're coming to the Capitol, but we're almost out of time, but at the bottom
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.320]  of the rat hole, what is running all of this?
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:59.320]  Obviously, you're a Christian.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:03.560]  You believe it's Satan, but for the layperson out there who isn't into religion or whatever,
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:07.800]  I mean, looking at this, when I say they're saying Hail Satan, there's really video of
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:08.800]  that.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.800]  I didn't know this until I got involved in media 20 years ago.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:16.880]  When you really run into these really pro-abortion people that run this, they, it's a religion
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.880]  to them.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:18.880]  It is.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:24.240]  You know, there's a scripture that says those who hate God love a death.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.080]  It's a culture of death.
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.760]  Death is what drives this, Satan's the author of death.
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.320]  He came to rob, kill and destroy.
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.680]  This is a religion to them.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:37.000]  And you know, this is nothing other than child sacrifice.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.280]  I hope the people understand that you could draw the parallels back to the Old Testament
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.280]  with the, with Mollick.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:45.880]  I mean, and this is what's happening in America.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:51.960]  We're not sacrificing our children to some pagan idol God, you know, some figure, but
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:56.880]  we're, we're sacrificing our children to choice to, to, I want a career.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:57.880]  I don't want a baby right now.
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:58.880]  I don't want to be married.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:02.960]  I don't want my boyfriend, whatever it is, it's still child sacrifice.
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:03.960]  That's what's driving us.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:08.920]  Well, a lot of ancient cultures would order the first born killed and, and they knew first
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:11.240]  born were the ones that got up at EM were leaders.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:14.080]  It was a way of getting rid of the next group of rebels.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.640]  And that's really what the Ridland, the boys is all about and all of it is it's about killing
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:19.640]  the next generation.
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:20.640]  Now, I agree.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.760]  And that's why we're trying to raise up a pro life generation.
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:28.920]  Our whole commitment at our organization created equals to raise up the next generation of
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.960]  leaders to take on this culture depth.
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.880]  We will take it on, you know, face to face in the public square.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.880]  We're not going to shrink back.
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:40.280]  We understand there's risk, but we've got to go for it.
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:42.520]  It's going to get worse before it gets better.
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:47.080]  And I expect much worse than what happened the other day and I'm girding our loins for
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.080]  what's coming.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:50.720]  Well, Mark Herrington, I hope I get to meet you when you're here in town.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:55.320]  Keep up the important work that you're doing for those innocent people out there.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:29:00.560]  But you know, when you talk about turning the tables, the state's power grabbing right
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.600]  now because it realizes the end has come.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:05.640]  Look at the polls from 1974 with Roe v. Wade.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:11.600]  They flipped now America's turning against abortion, especially in the youth.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:12.600]  That's right.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.560]  And it's primarily because of the technology.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:18.960]  Even you don't even have to have a regenerative heart to understand if you look at an ultrasound
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:21.640]  or an image or a pre-born baby to understand it's human.
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:25.480]  So that's what's that's what's turned the tide right now.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:29.160]  There are still many people out there in denial that they'll kill their baby no matter what.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:32.560]  You can give them all the evidence the world won't matter, but there's still enough people
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.720]  in the country that can reason with the conclusion that that's a human being and abortion shouldn't
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.720]  be permissible.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:41.960]  Well, look at the decline of our country since we brought it in and I'm not even judging
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:42.960]  everybody out there.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:43.960]  None of us are perfect.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.240]  We need to recognize it's bad.
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:47.000]  That's the beginning of turning the tide.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.500]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:49.500]  Thank you.
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:50.500]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:52.920]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:59.920]  Alex Jones.
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:03.960]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:04.960]  goes to sleep.
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.480]  I can take her on romantic dates.

[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:08.640]  You name it.
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:10.200]  She's just not the woman I married.
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.640]  Oh Ralph, that's just awful.
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.200]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.520]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.120]  If so, consider this.
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:22.160]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:28.760]  BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:32.640]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.800]  it comes to your natural systems.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:37.080]  Forget synthetic chemicals.

[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:14.960]  The already discounted maiden1776 t-shirts are only 1776.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:19.200]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.200]  out.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.200]  There's only 500 of each.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:25.760]  We're talking about maiden America, belt buckles, and nickel brass.
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:28.080]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:31.200]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:37.080]  But to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.080]  right now.
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:42.960]  And you get a membership at prisonplanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:46.840]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:50.560]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:32:00.080]  At maiden1776.com, Molan Lombay, you can take my gun from my cold, dead, ranch.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:03.800]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.240]  I didn't taste dirt in it.
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.560]  God knows what's in there.
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.600]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:16.640]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a Cropure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:17.640]  That one is better.
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:18.640]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:21.200]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like, it's good water.
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:27.280]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:31.400]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.960]  tooth decay, lower in IQ, and even cancer.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:36.920]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're in tap water.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:42.800]  The Propure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.800]  tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:46.280]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:47.280]  It's good water.
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:48.280]  Refreshing.

[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:20.360]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:30.080]  Well, I tell ya, Christmas comes, I don't know, six, seven, eight times a year for me
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:34.400]  when the former Congressman Dr. Ron Paul joins us.
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:39.720]  I think it's interesting that Larry McDonald was a proto-Ron Paul and was a medical doctor
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:42.760]  himself, and that's the type of folks we need to elect a Congress.
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:43.760]  Not more lawyers.
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:49.480]  It's so great to see his son, an MD, up there in the U.S. Senate, Ron Paul, the leader of
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:52.880]  the Republican PAC for president.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:55.320]  Everybody I talk to says, oh, I want Ron Paul.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:56.640]  We'll ask him about that coming up.
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:00.720]  We've got him for just one segment, just about 15 minutes here.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.800]  But sir, there's so much to talk about.
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:07.720]  Today, I'd like to just cover the waterfront with you.
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:10.520]  We've interviewed Border Patrol head of their union.
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:14.800]  We've shot the video ourselves and broke it four weeks ago that the Border Patrol loads
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:19.400]  the illegals on the buses, including adults, and buses them to be dropped off to Democratic
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:25.720]  Party facilities to then be given voter IDs and welfare.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:26.720]  This is the end of the country.
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.840]  I know as libertarians we are for, you know, more open borders, but not if we're bordering
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.680]  kleptocratic failed states.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:39.680]  What is your take on this crisis that Obama's clearly orchestrating and where it's going?
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.480]  Well, obviously, it's a huge problem.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:46.160]  I don't think there's one person with the wisdom that can wave a wand and deal with
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:51.560]  this because of all the intrigue going on, the mistakes made in the past, and the mess
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:54.240]  we have now, and kids coming in here.
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:58.600]  I thought of one thing, and this is obviously tongue-in-cheek, but, you know, maybe these
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.120]  buses ought to be taken to Hollywood.
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:08.680]  Let the Hollywood-type people who have promoted Obama for so long, let them see what's going
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:09.680]  on.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:13.160]  But, you know, you're right, the libertarians have different opinions.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:17.840]  Some are, you know, real die-hard, total open borders, and others aren't quite so.
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:23.240]  But, you know, I've written that up in Liberty Define pretty well the best I could on what
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:30.400]  it should be because, you know, if we live in a true free-market, prosperous society,
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:34.920]  there's usually a need for labor, and you want to be very generous about allowing people
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:35.920]  to come and go.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:42.040]  But this whole idea of coming in illegally, and then it's politicized because, oh, one
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:47.840]  party wants them to be voters, and also, we're bankrupt.
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.840]  We have a welfare state.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:54.680]  You know, I've said that, you know, we shouldn't give them any freebies, you know, free education
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.680]  and medical care.
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:02.720]  When you pay them, they pay you as being totally heartless, but, you know, it's so complicated
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:05.920]  because the countries they're coming from, they're worse than ours.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:11.600]  I mean, there's, you know, it involves the drug war, it involves dictatorships, it involves
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:18.240]  bad economic policy, and we have this, now, I don't, I think it's a sign of how bad our
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:24.640]  economy is and how bad our structure here in this country because there's so much resentment.
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:29.600]  But it is not, you know, the problems are not going to go away, but a better answer
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:36.560]  on the libertarian issue is my position there is, with the libertarians who say, well, you're
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:41.280]  not pure enough because you don't want totally open borders, I said, are you sure that in
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:46.160]  a total libertarian society, which, of course, we're not going to see, but we can talk about,
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:50.120]  total libertarian society, government doesn't own the property, the people own the property.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:54.920]  So the ranchers, all in taxes, would be the ownership and they would have somebody, they
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:57.960]  would have something to say about intrusion on their property.
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:02.960]  And therefore, anybody who came in from an outside, you know, would be met by property
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:05.720]  owners and they wouldn't be protected by the state.
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:11.880]  So I'm not so sure that you and I and a few others had an island and we owned the island,
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.360]  that it would be open borders.
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:18.280]  I would think that anybody who owns land on that island would have to be responsible and
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:21.360]  allow people to come in, but there wouldn't be a government.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:26.680]  So this is a consequence of runaway government, the mess we're in, the economy that we have,
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:31.840]  the welfare state, and of course, a lot of resentment has built up and then you get it
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.400]  all politicized with a guy like Obama.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:41.400]  Shifting gears, you have predicted in your books, you have predicted for decades that
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:46.120]  the private Federal Reserve would ruin the currency and debase it even faster.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:53.720]  Obviously, it had lost 99 cents by now and a lot of that value since 1913, since we got
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:58.600]  the private Federal Reserve, a lot of that loss has happened just the last few years.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.160]  We're seeing an acceleration.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:09.000]  Now even mainline economists and analysts are mirroring your breakdown dealing with the
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.520]  end of the dollar.
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:14.000]  Now we see China's yawn exploding.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.960]  We now see countries from South Korea to Russia moving away from the dollar.
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.600]  Saudi Arabia is starting to move away.
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:26.040]  It looks like that big event you've been warning about is getting closer and closer.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:31.720]  Can you speak to collapse and what's going to happen if the dollar does devalue, sir?
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:32.720]  Well, you're certainly right.
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:37.680]  It's getting much, much closer and it's not just a few third world countries or, you know,
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:40.000]  in the past, you've reported on it before.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.040]  You know, when Iran and Iraq would do it, then they'd get punished, you know, you can't
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:46.240]  give up on the dollar, don't take on the dollar.
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:50.720]  But now it's people like, you know, the Germans aren't all that happy with it.
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:56.920]  I saw today that the French are pretty annoyed with us too, you know, about, you know, how
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:01.400]  we handle our monetary policy and how we treat the people, you know, with spying on them
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:02.400]  and all the rest.
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:07.880]  But this whole episode of with Russia right now over Ukraine, it's probably the stupidest
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:13.440]  policy conceivable that we want to provoke a war with Russia, put on sanctions, and then
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:18.440]  they, they're not going to take that, and then all of a sudden, oh, you mean they can
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:24.400]  make an alliance with China and India, and they are?
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:28.760]  It probably takes a little while to do that, but that's what the plan is, and I think the
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:30.400]  numbers are coming together.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:35.880]  I think Brazil wants to be involved with that, and it's a growing effort, but I think there's
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:43.360]  a build-up hostility with America, because we've been bullying the world, but they've,
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:48.040]  nobody's been strong enough to take us on, especially since the breakdown of the Soviet
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.160]  system, that we've been the kingpin.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:55.320]  So economically and militarily, nobody can say boo, but once they see that our economy
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:40:01.000]  is in trouble and they have a chance to do something, they get sick, tired of these sanctions
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.960]  that are put on countries, because we tell them, you know, you can't talk, you can't
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:07.080]  trade with Russia, you can't do this.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:11.960]  Well, I think when we start to slip as we are, I think there's going to be piling on,
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:16.520]  I think the piling on has already occurred, which means that we're closer to that point
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:18.680]  where there may be a precipitous fall.
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:19.680]  You make the right points.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:26.200]  The Fed has orchestrated about a 98, 99% devaluation already, but it's still a dollar is a dollar
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:27.200]  today.
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:33.160]  What if you lose, lose the rest of it, and 100% or a large portion of what we have left?
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.160]  That's a big deal.
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:40.400]  And if you look at all the currency disruptions around the world, the end stages go very rapidly.
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:44.640]  Most people remember now about the Zimbabwe dollar, but they only remember the two or
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:49.640]  three months that it was in the news, but they had been doing that for a lot of years
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:51.800]  and then confidence is lost.
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:55.760]  There's still enough confidence in the dollar that tomorrow you're not going to read where
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.360]  everybody dumped the dollar.
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:02.560]  But I think central banks now buying up gold, you know, Russia, Russia mines it and they
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:08.280]  keep it, China buys the gold, India has always bought gold, and a lot of other people do,
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:13.320]  but our banks, the Western banks, the European banks, and of course, United States claim
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:14.960]  that there's no need for that.
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:15.960]  We're not going to buy it.
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:20.080]  But who knows what they're doing beyond the sea, and I suspect that they're doing the
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.080]  same thing.
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.080]  That's right.
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:27.400]  Zimbabwe went in just the space of a year, about five years ago, and it's still bad,
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:33.600]  inflation, where it took a million of their currencies to buy a loaf of bread to a trillion,
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:37.640]  which just showed some of those trillion dollar notes on screen, and their answer was total
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:43.800]  totalitarianism, and as a historian, as a medical doctor, as a Von Mies Institute fellow,
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:50.760]  I know that you've studied history, but undoubtedly the establishments rabid out of a hat is the
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:54.640]  armored vehicles, the checkpoints, the NSA surveillance.
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:59.480]  They think authoritarianism is going to hold this together, and their nukes are going to
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:01.320]  menace the rest of the world.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:06.640]  But then our own elite hate America, the old America, the ideas of liberty, they share
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:10.440]  that with the rest of the world that dislikes our imperiousness.
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:15.560]  So it's a very bizarre mix of factors where the establishments trying to shut off our
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:22.000]  power plants, cloward and piven, our governmental systems bankrupting them in a power grab,
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:27.320]  but I sit back looking at the wide spectrum, and I see the elite undermining their own
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:30.040]  empire that gave them their power.
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:35.560]  So it really seems like a evil system that doesn't even know what it's doing, or does
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:36.560]  it?
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.440]  Can they pull a rabid out of the hat, Dr. Ron Paul?
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:44.440]  No, temporarily they will, but they think they are omnipotent because they get away
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:49.080]  with it for so long, but eventually, you know, the markets and the people catch up with
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.080]  them.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:54.600]  So yesterday, I don't know if you noticed, there was a hearing in the financial services
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:59.720]  committee about auditing the Fed, of course, they wouldn't use my bill to audit, they bring
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:05.000]  up with this crazy scheme that they can do it by a formula.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.800]  And as long as the Fed follows this formula, which is just another form of economic planning,
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:14.600]  and they did this because the Fed's 100 years old, and they said, now it's time for reform,
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:18.400]  but they were pretending this was audit, had nothing to do with audit, although they used
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.400]  that language.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:23.920]  So I said in my, you know, my dissenting views, and they did take them, and they put them
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:29.800]  in the record, but they really didn't give it a serious discussion, and the big D is
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:36.440]  the, Paul Brown, you know, Congressman has the bill that I had for a long time, he has
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:41.400]  224 cosponsors, enough to pass the bill, and they wouldn't even bring that bill up and
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:42.400]  contemplate it.
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:46.840]  They bring up this other crazy thing of a price rule.
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:51.880]  A lot of economists say that it isn't that the Fed doesn't have a policy, they just lied
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:55.840]  to Congress and the public about what their policy is, and that they're already involved
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:58.360]  in a controlled collapse right now.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:01.600]  And most economists I interview, a lot of them prestigious, say we've really been in
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:04.960]  a depression since 2008 in most sectors.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:11.720]  Dr. Paul, you've given us a pretty accurate prognosis going back decades ago.
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:14.520]  What do you think our current real economic status?
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:20.440]  Well, I think it's in total shambles, and of course they sort of downplayed that one,
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:26.200]  I said in the O8 campaign that we were already starting in a recession, and of course the
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:29.360]  Republicans were in charge, so that was a really bad thing to say.
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:37.320]  No, I think certainly for the lower half of our economy, of our people, you know, the
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:42.200]  middle class and down, they're in a depression, you know, their standard living isn't going
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:46.440]  up, and real income hasn't gone up since the Bretton Woods broke down, since we went
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:50.120]  totally off the gold standard, real wages have not going up.
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:56.920]  Nominal wages do, but real wealth accumulation, you know, goes to the wealthy class deal in
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:02.400]  Wall Street, and even the Fed, they haven't been shy about saying, well, we are going
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:05.720]  to interfere, we have a plunge protection team, we have to go there and protect the
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:06.720]  markets.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:11.640]  Well, all this monetary inflation has gone to the market, but I think ultimately, and
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:15.320]  I think that's what you're suggesting, will they be able to protect themselves?
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:19.240]  A few may be, but there's going to be a lot who have benefited by this.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:23.960]  They won't know when to get out either, and it looks very, very shaky right now.
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:28.920]  I do not believe, you know, now they're saying, well, no more quantitative easing, and we're
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:33.320]  going to quit by October, but they don't have the biggest idea what conditions will be like
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.880]  in October, but they claim they're going to quit quantitative easing, but they're not
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:42.320]  going to allow interest rates go up, well, that means they're going to print money anyway,
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:45.920]  and they'll buy something else, it's just that they're not going to buy any more long-term
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:46.920]  bonds.
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:47.920]  Exactly.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:53.720]  And then that inflates the stock market, that's where the inflation's going, and people think
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:56.160]  it's really super valued, but it's not.
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:00.040]  It's actually just bought and devalued dollars, a very dangerous game indeed.
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:04.560]  You know, talking to you, who's obviously a very wise man, who's been a, you know, Air
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:10.680]  Force, you know, medical air corpsman, medical doctor, congress, author, the whole nine yards,
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:11.680]  you're a smart guy.
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:15.640]  And I was sitting there with you on the fishing dock, just between me and you in the fence
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:20.800]  post, and I said, Dr. Paul, where do you really think America and the world's going in your
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:22.480]  gut?
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:27.040]  In 120 seconds, you know, let's say you were talking to your grandson, and you were giving
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:32.640]  them advice, Willie giving them the skinny, what does your gut tell you is going to happen
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:34.840]  long-term to civilization?
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:39.560]  Well, long-term, I'm not as pessimistic as I am short-term.
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:44.000]  There's no way that the congress, a president, or a few more members of the congress are
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  in the Senate.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  Well, all of a sudden, they will reverse this because the momentum is so strong that debt
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.760]  is so big that, excuse me, the debt has to be liquidated.
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:57.960]  The only question how you liquidate debt is you don't pay it, which is in the case for
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:59.920]  a country like ours.
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:05.040]  They always pay it, but they pay it with paper money and devalue the currency, so we're locked
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.040]  in.
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:07.040]  It's not going to change.
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:11.400]  We're not going to, all of a sudden, oh, that's not going to quite so many wars.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:16.880]  This wean on ourselves off of the welfare state and the warfare state, and this gradually
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:18.200]  go back to the gold standard.
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:20.360]  It's not going to happen.
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:26.920]  Where I believe is, we're quite capable in five, 10, 20 years from now of having a group
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:33.200]  of people who have been influenced by everything from radio shows to the Internet and all the
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:39.120]  things going on, Austrian economics, because there's been a tremendous amount of excitement
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:42.080]  and understanding of the Federal Reserve in the last five years.
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:48.120]  Since ideas do have consequences, it's worked in the past, so I'm holding out with a tinge
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:56.360]  of hope and conviction that if we keep fighting the battle of ideas that we will then influence
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:00.920]  enough people that they will only endorse a government that presents a case of freedom
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:06.080]  for the individual, get out of these wars, sound money, and maybe paying a lot more attention
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.560]  to the Constitution.
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:13.760]  RonPaulChannel.com, what is it like, and we're not talking about you here, but it's an example
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:17.760]  of success, and we need to try to model ourselves off of that and augment from it.
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:22.320]  What is it like to be a voice in the wilderness 40 years ago, before you were even in Congress
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:31.040]  or before you were even writing best-selling novels and stories and books on economics?
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:37.240]  What is it like, though, to now see your son as a front-runner for president, to see your
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:39.240]  ideas popular all over the world?
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:43.760]  You're a central figure, like Alexander Seltzenitzen was in the 80s against communism.
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:48.560]  You're as big or bigger figure worldwide, and I know you're not a narcissistic person,
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:54.040]  but what does that mean now that you've reached true global icon status?
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:59.200]  Seriously, I mean, that's a testament to the power of taking action, of being a voice
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:05.000]  in the wilderness, of being Dr. No, and what's the main thing you want as a message to go
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  out to the young people?
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.040]  Well, the message is liberty, but I think you sort of stretched it a little bit.
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:14.880]  I hope I participated and helped along, but a lot of other people have, I mean, you've
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:18.640]  reached a lot of people, you can imagine, on people in a campaign trail, I said, wouldn't
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:19.640]  it you get interested?
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:24.040]  They could mention your show, and they'd mention Aaron Russo, I guess you remember Aaron Russo.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:25.040]  Oh, yes, big friend.
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:26.040]  We saw that document.
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:33.800]  So, people come in different ways, but back 30 years ago or 40 years, I'd go to college.
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.960]  I always did the same thing, but I'd get 20 people out to a little club or something
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:38.960]  like that.
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:44.200]  I was very stoic about the whole thing, and right now, it's a confirmation.
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:48.440]  I see it as a confirmation that ideas are very, very powerful, there's a lot of allies
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:49.440]  out there.
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:55.200]  If you look at the Mises Institute and the different libertarian groups now have participated
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:01.760]  tremendously in the 70s, well, earlier than that, in the 50s and the 60s, I had no place
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:02.760]  to go.
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:03.760]  There was no internet.
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:11.760]  The universities were jam-packed with nothing but socialists and Keynesians, but today, we
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:16.920]  have multiple organizations and a lot of books and a lot more professors, so it is quite
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:17.920]  a bit different.
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:25.600]  I feel good that I've been part of it, but it takes a lot of people, and I see the intellectual
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:34.520]  leaders, the Mises and Hayaks and Rothbard and these people who wrote and explained these
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:35.520]  things.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:39.720]  I think a lot of us have had a gut instinct of what is right, because some people say,
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:42.840]  you know, Ron, I like what you say, because it's so much common sense.
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:47.680]  I think a lot of people arrive where we are with common sense, but it's always good to
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:54.640]  get an intellectual, like a Mises, who can write and explain this in intellectual terms,
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:55.880]  and that's why I think this is real.
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:51:00.320]  I think the revolution is real, but you never know the outcome of the revolution, but right
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:07.560]  now, I think it's going quite well, not only because the internet is available to us, but
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:12.920]  because this system is going to fail, it's good that it's going to fail, the Soviet system
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:17.920]  has failed because it was a flawed system, so we have a lot of opportunities, and that's
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:21.240]  why I'm still anxious to talk to as many young people as possible.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:25.560]  RonPaulChannel.com, in the minute or two we have left former Congressman Ron Paul joining
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:26.560]  us.
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:29.560]  I wanted to ask you about impeachment of Obama.
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:34.520]  I get the Republicans did the same stuff, he's obviously gone further, and so we can
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:36.760]  impeach a bunch of them, Boehner, you name it.
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:41.760]  But if they get away with persecuting people with the IRS beyond Nixon, if he gets away
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:45.600]  with putting our military under NATO command, if he gets away with ordering the border patrol
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:49.840]  to stand down, if he gets away with all this stuff that sets a precedent, shouldn't we
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:53.960]  impeach even though politically it might not get the Republican libertarians as far
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:56.040]  because it's the right thing to do?
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:52:02.600]  It should be, but I don't know of any president in my lifetime that I would have been a champion
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:07.320]  of not impeaching them because so many of them have done the same thing, but the Congress,
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:11.640]  it's the ideology that is so bad, it's what we have to impeach because just think of what
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:14.840]  Congress has done to the presidency.
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:18.320]  We delivered, the Congress has delivered all this power here.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:22.680]  They allowed them to go to war, they allowed the monetary system to run roughshod over
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:29.080]  us, and they turned all this power over to the president, whether it's trade agreements
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:34.240]  or whatever, all the regulations should be illegal, that's writing a law.
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:42.680]  So yes, Obama, I think Obama is worse than the rest, not so much, he hasn't even written
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:50.520]  more executive order, but he's so in your face about it, it's, I will do it, and I have
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:54.720]  this National Spent Authorization Act, and if I think I have to assassinate somebody,
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:58.160]  I have the authority to do this, and he goes on and on.
[01:52:58.160 --> 01:52:59.640]  I'm good at killing people.
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:05.680]  Yeah, he had to do this, most other presidents just did it and so did it quietly, but it's
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:07.680]  bad that he can be so upfront.
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:12.520]  It's almost like he's too honest with us, and the people are too complacent, you know,
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:18.200]  this guy's telling us what he believes in, and he believes in, you know, a dictatorship.
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:23.760]  So, but they've all done it, but it's just a lot worse right now, and as I can tell
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:26.560]  you, the worst, you're going to see more of that, unfortunately.
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:30.960]  Well, you can see him almost every day with incredible folks at RonPaulChannel.com in
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:36.480]  the last 60 seconds, Rand Paul, for president, he is the best, obviously he's clearly going
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:42.320]  to run, how do we get behind that, how do we get him in, obviously that he'll get blamed
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:47.000]  for what the socialists have done, so it's kind of bittersweet, but 60 seconds on Rand
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.160]  Paul, the senator, becoming the next president.
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:56.600]  Well, it's the same old story, you go to his website and you volunteer, you send money,
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:04.320]  you do all those things conceivable because, you know, it's a rough road to hoe because,
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:09.240]  you know, the establishment's going to come down hard, and it seems like he may well be
[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:16.160]  the front runner right now, but if they think he's out there, believe me, they're going
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:20.200]  to come down hard, but it's just numbers, it's just numbers, you've got to have enough
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:26.760]  people because the media will not help, and I think he's getting a better shake, you know,
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:30.840]  from the media right now, but it's just going to have to be numbers, the numbers of people
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:33.520]  that, you know, volunteer and send money.
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:37.360]  Well, you know why the media already dug through all those closets, couldn't find anything,
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:41.280]  sent Democrats dressed as racists to his events to try to demonize him, that failed.
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:48.080]  I told Politico a few years ago when he won the nomination for Senate, I said, look, attack
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:53.520]  him and then he'll lose, only your endorsement will destroy him because people are sick of
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:58.280]  you and don't believe you, and so barring other things they could pull, I think he's
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:02.240]  got a real shot at it and it's very exciting and it's an example of how we fight tyranny
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.520]  generationally, everything you've taught us.
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:08.760]  Dr. Paul, RonPaulChannel.com, thank you so much for the time and say hi to the family
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:09.760]  for us.
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:11.480]  Hi Alex, good to be with you.
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:12.480]  Good to be with you sir.
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:13.480]  Wow.
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:16.320]  It's always a great pleasure to talk to Dr. RonPaul, who I've known since before he
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:22.440]  ran for Congress again in 1996 and I believe I'm one of the first people to ever interview
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:28.280]  Rand Paul because Rand was living in Texas then and just got out of college and stuff
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:31.040]  and hadn't even moved to Kentucky yet.
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:36.920]  This is about 19 years ago and I remember saying, well, no dad was just on yesterday
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:40.720]  and we got a lot of support because the district used to be up to the south of Austin, we're
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:44.720]  on a big station in Austin then, the top ratings my show did and I'll never, I'm not
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:48.320]  bragging, this is an interesting factoid story and I said, and he was on a few nights
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:54.520]  ago and was really big, we'd like to, you know, try to get him back on but he's flying
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:59.400]  around and stuff, you know, can you plug some more and I said, well, why don't you come
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:00.400]  on?
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:02.680]  Oh no, I can't do interviews.
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:03.680]  Somebody ought to dig that up.
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:08.920]  I believe I'm the first person to ever interview Rand Paul and let me tell you something, I
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:12.280]  could care less about presidents, red carpets, crap like that.
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:15.920]  I'll guarantee you, Rand Paul becomes president, he's not going to allow huge motorcades and
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:20.200]  traffic to be shut down, he'll fly around by helicopter or he'll just, I mean the secret
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:25.240]  service is out of control and I don't know, it's just so exciting to think they could
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:28.440]  put Rand Paul in there and he'll play a little politics, you know, it's going to take that
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:32.400]  for him to get in there but he's a good guy, I know him and that's why they hated him so
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:36.200]  much and the big banks gave all that money against him and the rest of it, he just is
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:40.560]  super and I hope he becomes president.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:43.320]  Now obviously they're going to blame him for what happens in the economy and the collapse,
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:47.880]  I mean he might get elected, everything collapses and they blame it on him but the mainstream
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:53.200]  media is not dominant anymore, they're not going to be able to spin all that when it
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:54.200]  happens.
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:58.080]  And I just see all the planets aligning, not just for Rand Paul but for the whole Liberty
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:00.760]  movement worldwide because that's how God works.
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:06.120]  The evil's rising but good is rising as well and if we just take action, do the right thing,
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:10.840]  try to be good people and say, God I'm weak, just hold my hands up, you know, help me
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:11.840]  go forward.
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:16.320]  That goes back to Jericho, you know, who wasn't the Bible, couldn't hold their hands up anymore
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:20.800]  so the people had to hold their hands up, it was Moses, I guess it happened several
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:25.680]  times in the Bible but the whole point is, that's how God works and if you don't believe
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:31.280]  in God, the universe, whatever, those forces are real, providence is real and it isn't
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:34.800]  just like the secret that Oprah teaches where you believe something that happens, no, you
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:39.360]  believe it, if it's the right thing to do and you have courage, you might not realize
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:43.760]  it, you may be your grandkids that do it but it will have an effect in the universe.
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:47.840]  That's why the evil ones are always so busy telling you don't have power because they're
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:51.240]  scared to death of good people, they're absolutely scared to death of the truth, they're scared
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:58.120]  to death of real male power, real feminine power, not the state makes women powerful by
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:03.760]  destroying men but men empower women, women empower men, I mean they're scared of families,
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:07.760]  they're scared of culture, they want to destroy us all, they're pure evil.

[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:53.720]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:56.640]  much get healthy and detoxified.
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:01.400]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:05.760]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:11.320]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group, you now know it as survival shield,
[01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:16.440]  true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb, then about a year ago he said, listen,
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:21.560]  if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals
[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:27.480]  and the results that I personally have had have been life changing, nobody else has got

[01:59:53.000 --> 02:00:06.000]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:12.880]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers, well so does
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:23.240]  he, he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:32.120]  You know, some days I get off here and I think, man, you sound like a bragging, arrogant,
[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:39.880]  narcissistic, egomaniac and I know that's not how I am.
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:43.400]  I have to get gutted up to fight these people, I have to, I sit here and look at all this
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:49.320]  news all day, I know what they're up to and I just, I'm a very loving, sweet person but
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:52.360]  when people mess with me or try to dominate me, I just flip out, I mean that's just how
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:53.480]  I am.
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:58.920]  So this is all real what you hear on air, I mean I kind of let myself be bad and blow
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:04.480]  up and stuff but it's real, just like I let myself, you know, put six hex underwear on
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:08.080]  my head and make fun of stuff because I'm a funny guy behind the scenes, I really should
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:13.680]  have just been in comedy, that's what I have fun doing and people say, man, that's pretty
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:20.200]  discrediting what you did, I just, I can't help it, it's real and when I blow up on air
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:26.960]  folks, it's real, I mean it's real and the reason I went off talking about myself right
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:30.240]  there, I say, I don't want to talk about myself, so you can understand where I'm coming from
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:34.840]  because I get embarrassed of myself, I mean I was there, it sounded like groveling to
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:39.080]  Ron Paul's and how great he is and how wonderful he is but that's just really what I'm thinking
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:44.440]  so I'm just going to say it, I can't help it but then I realize in my gut later and
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:49.080]  intellectually I go, no, no, it's right, you tell people how big this show is so people
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:55.320]  understand we're not all alone, liberty's popular and it's important people know what
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:59.720]  Ron Paul's done with your help and my help and if Ron runs and doesn't win, he'll educate
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:05.920]  people and become more iconic but I don't think he's the father, more eloquent but not
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:11.880]  the father, we have to celebrate our leaders and celebrate our voices and the wilderness
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:18.600]  that have been successful, this is biblical in proportions, just got chills and I've got
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:23.760]  to realize, hey, I got millions of viewers and listeners, I better wear a sports jacket,
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:30.040]  I better lose some weight, I better care about myself and the position I'm in to help people,
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:34.600]  I better live a long time for not just my children but for everybody just like we want
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:38.640]  you to be a winner, we shouldn't let the enemy demoralize us or get us down, you know I got
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:43.960]  down some this week and I made a commitment this morning when I woke up that I was going
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:48.520]  to be in a good mood today because you know we're here fighting, there's a lot of good
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:54.080]  forces in the world and I think we can turn things around but I get really upset and almost
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:59.720]  start crying when I think about how bad it's going to get if we don't stop this, I mean
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:05.200]  that's where the anger comes from because if people just knew, but I guess they do know,
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:14.040]  you know I went in to talk to some folks about a school my children might go to and the head
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:16.400]  lady was a listener and she said her brother was a listener and a bunch of other folks
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:19.960]  were listening, people in the parking lot were listeners and one guy came in to fill
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:24.360]  a propane tank and he was a listener from England who's moved here and then I went
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:27.320]  and stopped at the gas station to get gas and the people on both sides pumping gas were
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:31.640]  listeners, a black guy and a white lady, two different cars beside me and then I went in
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:35.640]  the store and the clerk was a listener and then I was walking in the parking lot here
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:38.400]  and some American dude and guy was crossing the street and he was a listener, I mean every
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:44.760]  person I came by today, almost every person was a listener, I don't know how they're
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:48.160]  all listeners and I mean a lot of them listen all the time, I was talking to them, we don't
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:52.920]  have those numbers, yeah 15, 20 million a week, but you know 700, 800 million views
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:58.080]  on YouTube, 400 million on one channel, but I don't know where it's, and I think my God,
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:06.280]  I'm like talking to millions of people and it's not a power trip, it's like why me God?
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:10.600]  And then I think about how I'm a man folks, I'm just like everybody else, I'm sure not
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:16.480]  some saint or angel, I mean compared to a lot of people, people would say yeah you are
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:23.440]  like a champ, being a good guy overall, I don't screw people, Tony Montana, I ain't
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:26.840]  never broken my word to anybody and I never come after anybody, didn't have it coming
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:30.720]  to them and at the time if I got an enemy trying to stab me in the throat, I'll just
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:35.160]  step right over them, I don't even enjoy destroying enemies anymore, I used to and it was an evil
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:38.960]  thing, I repented of it, I couldn't get over doing it about 10 years ago and God healed
[02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:44.560]  me, now I take disgust in even having to defeat my enemies, but I have victory seeing the
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:49.200]  innocent get out of the clutches of the evil and so we should all celebrate how successful
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:52.960]  we've been in all of you are part of this victory, just as much as I am and this crew
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:57.800]  out here are sponsors in everybody, we should celebrate that we're still in the game and
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:15.880]  have
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:17.880]  or maximum potency.

[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:00.880]  I can taste dirt in it.
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:01.880]  God knows what's in there.
[02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:05.880]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:11.880]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:12.880]  That one is better.
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:13.880]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:15.880]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:16.880]  It's good water.
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:22.880]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:29.880]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:32.880]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:40.880]  The ProPure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:41.880]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:42.880]  It's good water.
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:43.880]  Refreshing.
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:44.880]  It's good.
[02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:51.880]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and get your free wire stand with the purchase of the ProPure Big Water Filtration System.
[02:07:51.880 --> 02:08:03.880]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:07.880]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:10.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:13.880]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:16.880]  Run on for a long time.
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:19.880]  Run on for a long time.
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:22.880]  Sooner or later, we're going to cut you down.
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:32.880]  The corrupt, kleptocratic eugenicist-based system that we're under has an absolute hatred of humanity in general.
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:41.880]  And they use our own empathy, our own caring for these poor immigrants that are in absolute squalor and tyranny in Guatemala and south of there,
[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:49.880]  being busted deliberately by the North American Union to bankrupt the country, create the gulag casino model that Max Kaiser talks about.
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:58.880]  They use our compassion to get us to sign on to political correctness to accept this in America's final journey into slavery.
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:00.880]  They've done the same thing in Europe.
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:04.880]  And you're not going to help Latin America implode in North America.
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:06.880]  We'll get Max Kaiser's take on that.
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:11.880]  Max predicted a major move by the middle of this year, last year, on record.
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:13.880]  We don't even have the crew to dig all that up, but you heard him.
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:15.880]  He wrote articles about it.
[02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:19.880]  He has predicted the move away from the dollar by the middle of the year.
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:22.880]  Now, he predicted the bond market would start imploding by the middle of the year, too.
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:25.880]  That hasn't quite happened yet, but it's moving in that direction.
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:35.880]  I just had Ron Paul on saying that it's more imminent than ever, saying that it's been building towards this and it finally accelerates at the end.
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:42.880]  I've had so many other economists, stockbrokers, top analysts on basically concurring with what Max is saying.
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:44.880]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and others are moving in that direction.
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:50.880]  We'll get his take on the economy on the whole waterfront coming up today with Max Kaiser.
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:54.880]  First off, this hour is brought to you by Infidel Body Armor.
[02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:57.880]  InfidelBodyArmor.com, it's made in Texas.
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:08.880]  By a U.S. Air Force veteran outside Dallas used by defense contractors in Afghanistan, police all over the world, by civilians who want to be prepared for what hits the fan.
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:14.880]  Armor is still legal, and they've got every different size you need out there, 10% off.
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:17.880]  Again, for the fourth of July, they always have some specials going.
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:25.880]  You see what those are right now at infidelbodyarmor.com or 888-608-6605, infidelbodyarmor.com.
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:30.880]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, my body armor only goes up in value over the years.
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:34.880]  It's level three, and it's more affordable than a lot of other types out there, so check it out.
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:38.880]  Don't forget, mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex.
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:41.880]  The government's gearing up with bullets and food and all the rest of it.
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:48.880]  You should, too, in the place I get prepared with the best quality, storeable foods at the best prices, non-GMO, great customer service.
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:55.880]  Mypatsupply, mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex. I found the specials are 866-229-0927.
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:57.880]  Check them out today.
[02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:03.880]  And don't forget, in the month of July, we've got upwards of 25 to 45% off.
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:06.880]  Even brand new best-selling shirts that we don't need to discount.
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:11.880]  I just love to do the discounts because we sell twice as many and still fund our operation,
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:13.880]  and then more of the shirts hit the ground out there.
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:22.880]  You'll meet fellow patriots, fellow info warriors, wearing a shirt that has a red body pointing a gun at a blue body
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:26.880]  with a bag of money in its hand saying socialism is somebody with a gun robbing you.
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:33.880]  With the Molan Lobby shirts in male and female, Made in America.
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:40.880]  The limited edition brass belt buckles and nickel belt buckles, 500 of each, that are almost sold out in the nickel.
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:43.880]  And there's not many left in the solid brass, that's my favorite.
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:45.880]  So that funds the operation.
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:49.880]  They should be over $100. They're numbered on the back, they're $44.95.
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:54.880]  These things cost us over $20 a piece, Made in America owned by a veteran.
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:57.880]  It's made out on the west coast to us up in Oregon.
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:00.880]  So again, these are very handsome. I wear mine daily.
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:02.880]  Got in a hurry, forgot to wear it today.
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:05.880]  But I designed it. I hope you enjoy it.
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:07.880]  And thank you all for your support.
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:17.880]  M4Wars, Life.com, M4Store.com, Made in 1776.com, and the Made in America black ball caps, golf shirts, you name it.
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:22.880]  And again, they funded the revolution by selling trinkets in this country.
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:24.880]  I don't sell trinkets, I sell high quality stuff.
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:30.880]  They made Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin go around at women's parties and sell little American flags.
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:35.880]  Okay, well, I'm here selling high quality Made in America flags that will fly for years.
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:37.880]  I'm selling high quality stuff.
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:39.880]  Water filters, the best quality, lowest price.
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:42.880]  Biggest distributor of Pro Pure because we have the lowest prices.
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:43.880]  Promo code water.
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:46.880]  This is how we fund the operation.
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:51.880]  And in closing, I want to salute all of you that are prisonplanet.tv members.
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:53.880]  I see the nightly news, all my films and more.
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:56.880]  We're doing the year end special in July this year.
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:12:59.880]  Five plus months free when you sign up for a year.
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:03.880]  11 memberships per membership, 11 people can use it simultaneously.
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:07.880]  That's one cent a day for each person that uses it.
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:09.880]  One cent a day for a membership.
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:11.880]  Buy a membership, share it with friends and family.
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:14.880]  See the nightly news, the live events.
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:16.880]  Take the info war to the next level.
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:23.880]  Funding this operation as we fearlessly and with no apologies, viciously openly wear our bias of telling the truth
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:28.880]  and being savagely, pro-male, pro-female, pro-child, pro-human.
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:37.880]  Viciously, unapologetically in the face of the tyrants, waging all out, accelerated warfare in the info war against the criminal class.
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:38.880]  We are here.
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:39.880]  We're going all in.
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:43.880]  And that's why we're so fired up because this is what's life is all about.
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:48.880]  Now, joining us is Max Kaiser of MaxKaiser.com.
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:51.880]  He's just been interesting monetary news as well on Bitcoin and more today.
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:57.880]  MaxKaiser.com, and I'll give you his bio, even though you know who Max Kaiser and Ron Paul are.
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:00.880]  He's a filmmaker, broadcaster, former broker and options trader.
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:05.880]  He's known for his invention of virtual specialist technology, used in many socket changes today.
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:09.880]  And he's labeled JPMorgan the biggest financial terrorist on Wall Street.
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:13.880]  And he joins us right now, MaxKaiser.com.
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:18.880]  Max, there's so much to cover before we get into the economy and the global meltdown and the rest of it.
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:26.880]  What do you make of the North American Union in Petraeus' words and Pelosi's and the Republicans standing by as the border is basically opened?
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:28.880]  I know you're a libertarian like I am.
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:34.880]  We could have this if Mexico was open too and didn't have all their systems, but we have welfare here.
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:40.880]  I mean, this is the ultimate cheap labor for the corporation's welfare sponsored like Walmart.
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:41.880]  What do you think about this?
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:46.880]  And do you think it's going to get a lot worse now that they've legalized all these people that will draw even more?
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:47.880]  MaxKaiser.
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:50.880]  Hey Alex, great to be with you again.
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:54.880]  And hello to everybody around the world and especially in Austin, Texas.
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:15:02.880]  Hey, do you remember a couple of years ago, they talked a lot about the Amiro and you haven't heard about the Amiro in a long time.
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:12.880]  And that was the idea that Canada, America and Mexico were going to come together as a currency block to kind of counterbalance what was happening in the Eurozone.
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:17.880]  And we then, you didn't hear about it for a while because the Eurozone went into a financial crisis.
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:19.880]  Greece went into a crisis.
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:22.880]  Ireland went into a crisis and didn't hear much about the Amiro.
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:33.880]  I think now this idea of what we're seeing on the border with Mexico and these comments being made in Congress, they're setting the stage to bring back this idea of the Amiro.
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:34.880]  And why now?
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:42.880]  Because at the moment, you've got Russia, China and Iran are forming a currency block.
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:54.880]  So are the BRIC nations as well, but I think more importantly, the China, Russia, Iran are forming this very strategic currency block under the what's called the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:57.880]  It rivals the Eurozone in size.
[02:15:57.880 --> 02:16:07.880]  It's obviously based on, in large part on natural resources, which going forward is going to be a key factor, much more than the economies that are based on printing money.
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:21.880]  The risks that Ron Paul outlined just previously on your show, those risks have now hit an end game, if you will, and we're heading into a period of a much more aggressive inflation.
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:25.880]  So economies that are resource-based are going to be much more important.
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:27.880]  So I think that's what's going on.
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:38.880]  They're setting the stage for a talk is going to start to bring back this Amiro idea that Canada, Mexico and the U.S. have to create a common currency because Eurozone has a common currency.
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:46.880]  And now there's a currency, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization with Russia, China, Iran, and of course the BRICs are doing something as well.
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:48.880]  And I think that's what's happening out.
[02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:50.880]  I think we're going to start hearing about the Amiro.
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:55.880]  Max, when you said that, it all clicked because the Republican and Democratic leaders are all saying,
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:17:01.880]  we've got to be one hemisphere, Petraeus is saying it, Pelosi is saying it, Petraeus is saying it in Europe.
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:03.880]  It's all a new talking point.
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:12.880]  But you go back to the North American Union documents from BAMP Canada in 2006 and 2007, they say we'll use a border crisis to bring this in.
[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:14.880]  And then that's what they're talking about.
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:19.880]  Billions of investment in Mexico to, quote, stem the tide.
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:23.880]  They mean investment to their buddies and themselves, not to the people.
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:32.880]  So the answer to a failed Latin America will be to merge with it and all just clicked when you said that you're absolutely on target.
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:34.880]  Yeah, well, that's what I hear.
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:36.880]  That's what I think is going to happen.
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:44.880]  And that's what the language suggests to me, that they're setting the stage for this currency union and organization.
[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:51.880]  And then you have, of course, these pipelines that extend from Canada through the America into Mexico.
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:57.880]  So there's an enormous amount of commercial activity with the three countries working in cooperation.
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:02.880]  You also have these trade deals like TTIP and others that are global trade deals.
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:05.880]  You know, you would call it a globalist trade deal.
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:07.880]  That's exactly what's going on.
[02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:10.880]  They are circumventing sovereignty.
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:18.880]  So they're setting the stage for a lot of commercial activities going on between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada.
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:29.880]  And to do battle as they will position it, they say we need this because competitively, we're going to lose out if we allow these new currency blocks to take over from the dollar.
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:30.880]  And that's what they always do.
[02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:42.880]  I mean, that's what Toronto Commission Decades ago said, create three regions, have them compete for further globalization, then claim they've got to coordinate them all out of a later global meltdown.
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:48.880]  That will then form the one world government like they form the Federal Reserve to stop booms and bust.
[02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:52.880]  They will use the cycle they've engineered to hold us hostage.
[02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:54.880]  You concur with that analysis.
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:55.880]  Yeah, sure.
[02:18:55.880 --> 02:18:58.880]  And you know, you had Jim Rickards on your show recently.
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:01.880]  He wrote the book Currency War and he just wrote the book Death of the Dollar.
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:04.880]  And he's done a lot of work on this.
[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:08.880]  The U.S. dollar has been the world reserve currency since the end of World War II.
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:13.880]  Most spectacularly, you know, gave rise to the American Century, so-called.
[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:15.880]  And now that's hit the buffers.
[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:17.880]  The U.S. dollar is being exited.
[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:22.880]  As you see, China, Russia, Iran are doing these huge currency swaps amongst themselves.
[02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:23.880]  They're getting out of the dollar.
[02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:28.880]  We just had a $400 billion dollar deal announced between Russia and China for a new gas pipeline.
[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:30.880]  That's an enormous deal.
[02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:36.880]  Ostensibly, they say it's priced in dollars, but we know that they're not going to use dollars to consummate that deal.
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:38.880]  They're going to use everything outside of the dollar.
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:43.880]  And everything you said five years ago here and a year ago here is now happening.
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:49.880]  I want to get the latest fine-tuned predictions now that we're getting closer to the big event that Ron Paul calls it.

[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:28.880]  They don't even talk to somebody that speaks Spanish. They just let them through.
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:33.880]  TSA allowing illegals to fly without verifiable IDs says Border Patrol Union.
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:39.880]  Again, boom. It just shows how it's all a hoax, people.
[02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:44.880]  It's all a hoax, and then out of this they have the new North American ID they're announcing.
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:47.880]  But still, whoever they don't want to have to follow it doesn't have to.
[02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:51.880]  It's like the big banks launder the money. Trillions of it.
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:56.880]  Well, Covia and Wells Fargo, $378 billion came out three years ago, over two years.
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:25:00.880]  No one even got in trouble.
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:04.880]  Max Kiger's our guest long segment coming up. This is a short segment.
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:07.880]  Max, I want to get into the economy and the dollar. That's what folks are really concerned about.
[02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:16.880]  Describe for people as this collapse accelerates what it will probably look like, this big event, the time frames you're talking about.
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:20.880]  Because it's like the creeping to the exits. Ron Paul talked about this last hour.
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:26.880]  That first a few people get up, then more get up, and finally everybody rushes to the exits.
[02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:29.880]  We've now reached where everybody's standing up, I think.
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:33.880]  And then they're starting to move towards the door. Does that take a month, six months, a year?
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:40.880]  And what will it look like, Max Kiger? And what will the political class do to try to stop that?
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:43.880]  Because they're obviously not going to just let all this go by the wayside.
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:46.880]  They're going to try to pull something. Max Kiger.
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:56.880]  It looks like inflation. And you already see evidence of it creeping into the day-to-day lives of the overwhelming majority of Americans.
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:00.880]  Notice that the price of food and energy is going up.
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:09.880]  The portions of the consumer products, the containers are getting smaller while the prices are staying the same. Wages are stagnant.
[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:19.880]  The theory after the 2008 crisis was that if you flood the economy with enough money, you will achieve what they called escape velocity.
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:24.880]  That the economy would be self-perpetuating. But that never happened.
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:32.880]  The government just reported the latest quarterly GDP figures, and they were shocked that it was down over 2%.
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:35.880]  That's an enormous contraction in the economy.
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:43.880]  That means that all the money they printed to bail out all the bankers of the past five to six years has not resulted in any economic growth whatsoever.
[02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:47.880]  Meanwhile, prices continue to go up and wages continue to contract.
[02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:54.880]  So for the average person, they are experiencing, as some have suggested, they are experiencing depression-like conditions.
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:27:01.880]  And for those who are the first in line to get that cash as it rolls off the central bank's printing press,
[02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:09.880]  they are experiencing the greatest asset bubble in the history of the world, where they're buying fine art, they're buying collectibles,
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:14.880]  they're buying stocks, these inflated prices, and they're seeing their net worths double and triple.
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:21.880]  So that's the result. This is the biggest wealth and income gap we've seen in a very long time, not since the robber barons.
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:28.880]  Have you seen such a high concentration of wealth at the tippity top and everyone else really suffering at the bottom end of the spectrum?
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:35.880]  And Max, I guess the theory is too, the public's so dumb, they're going to believe two plus two equals five and common core,
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:41.880]  that businesses didn't build their business and that we're so economically dumb, we don't know we're in a depression,
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:51.880]  as everybody moves in with their parents, as the restaurants close, as the factories close, as beef prices double, as meat prices go up 60%.
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:28:00.880]  As the inflation hits, they just put out fake numbers saying there isn't inflation and then let them eat cake. I mean, is it the Marie Antoinette model?
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:08.880]  Well, the numbers are fake and Peter Schiff has done an excellent job at doing videos pointing out how the GDP, the CPI,
[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:15.880]  these numbers that the government publishes are really quite remarkably fake.
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:23.880]  And the casino Gulag, which is a concept that I came up with on your show, I guess a couple of years ago, I think that explains a lot of the mentality,
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:32.880]  because in America, you can get a lot of people to accept a lot of really bad things if you hold out the possibility of winning the lottery.
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:41.880]  I think for a lot of people, the idea is they know the situation is bad, but they see some people winning and they think that they're going to be the next winner.
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:49.880]  So they buy into the concept of this casino Gulag. They're willing to live in a Gulag if they can hit the jackpot at the casino.
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:53.880]  And look at a stock, I'll give you a point of your direction, point your attention to this stock.
[02:28:53.880 --> 02:29:01.880]  The symbol or the name of the company is CYMK. It's a company that has no employees or one employee.
[02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:12.880]  Headquartered in Belize. This has been covered on ZeroHedge.com. They recently achieved a $5 billion market valuation in the stock market,
[02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:18.880]  and yet there's absolutely nothing there. It's a completely fictitious company. It's a hoax.
[02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:24.880]  Now they've suspended trading on this company, and it'll just become part of the ether.
[02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:29.880]  That's where at the last stages of this hyperventilated speculative bubble, I think.
[02:29:29.880 --> 02:29:33.880]  Stay there. When we come back, I'm going to give you the floor to break down what it'll look like.
[02:29:33.880 --> 02:29:43.880]  I mean, your best approximation and the timeframe, because clearly, I mean, the wallpaper on the rotten structure is wearing thin.
[02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:59.880]  We can see all the termites boiling under the surface. Stay with us.
[02:30:14.880 --> 02:30:21.880]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling out. There's only 500 of each.
[02:30:21.880 --> 02:30:28.880]  We're talking about Made in America belt buckles and nickel brass. This is more than a summer blowout special.
[02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:37.880]  This is a new declaration of independence, but to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free.
[02:30:37.880 --> 02:30:46.880]  Right now, when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv, for a limited time, only $39.95 a year, that's more than five months free off the regular price.
[02:30:46.880 --> 02:30:53.880]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at Madein1776.com.
[02:30:53.880 --> 02:31:08.880]  In the near future, when you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:14.880]  This is Homeland Security, analysis, info wars, building independent media operations.
[02:31:14.880 --> 02:31:21.880]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:24.880]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:27.880]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[02:31:27.880 --> 02:31:29.880]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:31:29.880 --> 02:31:31.880]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:31:31.880 --> 02:31:33.880]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:40.880]  They are never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:07.880]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[02:32:07.880 --> 02:32:09.880]  She's just not the woman I married.
[02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:11.880]  Oh Ralph, that's just awful.
[02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:13.880]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:32:13.880 --> 02:32:16.880]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:27.880]  If so, consider this, the abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[02:32:27.880 --> 02:32:34.880]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:36.880]  Forget synthetic chemicals.

[02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:32.880]  All this institutional computerized rigged inequity, globalization at work.
[02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:42.880]  The billionaires that control trillions, all tax exempt, lobbying for open borders and more prisons, globalization at work.
[02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:47.880]  If you like to wait things are going, you like the open attack on humanity.
[02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:51.880]  Well, don't hold your breath because you're not going to have to wait very long.
[02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:54.880]  The tyranny is here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:54.880 --> 02:33:56.880]  And it's only going to get more crazy.
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:34:07.880]  That's the thing I've studied about history is that tyranny, autocratic, totalitarianism goes from bad to worse to insane to off the chart.
[02:34:07.880 --> 02:34:11.880]  Crazy town.
[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:15.880]  Every ancient culture would finally just order everyone to start sacrificing their children.
[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:17.880]  Just to see if you do it.
[02:34:17.880 --> 02:34:20.880]  And burning down areas of cities for fun.
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:22.880]  I mean, just study history.
[02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:25.880]  Bathing in children's blood.
[02:34:25.880 --> 02:34:27.880]  And I use the example a lot of Caligula marrying his horse.
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:29.880]  That's nothing.
[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:36.880]  And then having it, you know, basically crap in the Senate and they would read the droppings and decide to make decisions off the horses droppings.
[02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:38.880]  I'm not kidding.
[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:44.880]  You know, you can have democratic party websites make jokes about that, thinking their audience is dumb and doesn't know that's true.
[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:48.880]  What I'm saying is this is getting really bad, okay?
[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:53.880]  And it's a form of degeneracy to engage in this type of corruption and then to one up each other.
[02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:57.880]  Max Kaiser calls it suicide bankers.
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:01.880]  And he has a great story, a sad story to describe exactly what that means.
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:04.880]  But you wanted to get into records who was on.
[02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:11.880]  You wanted to get into what the implosion is looking like versus the propaganda and where you say we're going.
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:13.880]  Max Kaiser Max Kaiser dot com.
[02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:15.880]  I don't want to get into some other issues with you.
[02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:20.880]  But Max, I mean, is this suicide bankers running the world?
[02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:25.880]  And are they evil or are they just completely mentally ill?
[02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:30.880]  Well, let's look at the question is what what's this going to look like?
[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:32.880]  What can we expect?
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:37.880]  And I think something happened last week in Spain that is very important.
[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:42.880]  They are now charging customers a negative interest rate to have money at the bank.
[02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:45.880]  This is something we've talked about on your show for a few years.
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:46.880]  Hundreds of times.
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:47.880]  And now they're talking about bail ins.
[02:35:47.880 --> 02:35:48.880]  Go ahead.
[02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:49.880]  Right.
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:50.880]  So this is now for real.
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:55.880]  People in Spain, if you put a thousand dollars in the bank, they're going to charge you to keep the money at the bank.
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:35:59.880]  So this has gone beyond just not giving you any interest on your savings.
[02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:05.880]  Now they're just confiscating a rate of your savings every single year.
[02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:13.880]  This is on top of the bail ins and Cyprus and this is on top of the ECB is now charging member banks a negative interest rate.
[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:30.880]  So the this low rate environment, which is there to allow speculators to borrow money at 0% to give them the opportunity to make wild, outrageous, speculative 60 to 100 to one bets at no cost to borrow the money.
[02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:35.880]  With the provides of that, if the bet goes bad, they get bailed out by the state.
[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:37.880]  That's why these rates are at 0%.
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:43.880]  Unfortunately, it has the negative side effect of causing a tremendous amount of money going into horrible investments.
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:48.880]  Like let's start a war in Afghanistan to get all the heroin production.
[02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:52.880]  Let's start a war in Iraq because we're going to feed our military contractors.
[02:36:52.880 --> 02:37:04.880]  Let's engage in same domestic policies and give computer information technology companies billions of dollars to build surveillance states, even though this has proven to be a complete waste of time.
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:11.880]  It doesn't make anyone any less in danger from the very people that are putting these systems in place.
[02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:20.880]  So that's the main problem with low interest rates is that it creates incredibly dangerous investments because there's no risk.
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:26.880]  The thing about capitalism is if it's working efficiently, if you make a bad investment, you suffer the consequences.
[02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:27.880]  There's risks involved.
[02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:40.880]  But when you take the risk away from people who have access to cheap money or 0% interest rate, then you're just creating a class of psychopaths that have access to unlimited funds that are destroying everything in their path.
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:43.880]  And you see that happening in the US and you see the US foreign policy.
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:51.880]  The rest of the world is getting fed up with it and they figured out that if they can get out of the dollar, then they can get out of harm's way.
[02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:54.880]  That's why they're creating these competing blocks of currencies.
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:38:02.880]  That's why the US dollar is losing its place in the global commerce from used to be 80% of global trade was in the dollar.
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:10.880]  Now it's maybe 62%, 63% is rapidly depreciating because the rest of the world wants out of the dollar matrix.
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:13.880]  And this will have the effect in America forcing prices up.
[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:23.880]  Because in America, when corporations and Americans buy stuff from overseas, they do so using US dollars, the World Reserve currency.
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:29.880]  Let me stop for just a minute because I get emails and I see comments and I even see reporters make fun of me.
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:31.880]  And they go, I don't trade in dollars.
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:33.880]  I'm not a currency speculator.
[02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:36.880]  Why do we care if the dollar goes down?
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:41.880]  Maybe it's good and then I hear statements like, yeah, I don't care if the stock market goes down.
[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:42.880]  I don't own stock.
[02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:48.880]  Can you talk to the average person out there and explain to them what a massively devalued dollar will do?
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:57.880]  We're already seeing the prices go up, but explain it to people in layman's terms because they've convinced so many Americans not to care about anybody, not even themselves.
[02:38:57.880 --> 02:39:04.880]  Can you explain to these idiots, not my main listeners, but the people out there that don't get how serious this is?
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:15.880]  Charles de Gaulle called it the extravagant privilege where America would write checks that they never had to cash because all they did was print more money.
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:24.880]  And as a result, in 1971, Nixon closed the gold window and we went on a pure fiat currency system and the US dollar became World Reserve currency.
[02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:33.880]  We're at a situation now, similarly, countries like China, Russia, Iran and around the world, they figured out that America never makes good on their obligations.
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:36.880]  They never pay the debts that they owe these countries.
[02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:39.880]  America has $17 trillion in domestic debt.
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:45.880]  They've got hundreds of trillion dollars worth of foreign debt and they don't plan to pay off those debts.
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:52.880]  They just plan to create more bonds and more securities to swap at these ultra low interest rates.
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:40:02.880]  So when these countries say, you know what, we don't think that's really going to work for us anymore and they get out of the dollar and therefore America has no one to buy their bonds.
[02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:07.880]  There's no one to buy the instruments that finance the day-to-day operation of America.
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:17.880]  It means that Americans have to finance the day-to-day operation of America and the only way to do that is going to be through ultra high inflation and ultra high taxes.
[02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:26.880]  Property taxes would start to increase, gasoline goes up higher because the country needs that cash to pay its day-to-day bills that up until now have been paid by foreigners.
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:28.880]  But foreigners are going to say no way.
[02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:32.880]  That's where the dollar kicks in as a factor.
[02:40:32.880 --> 02:40:37.880]  You see it suddenly in the price of things just going up quite dramatically and you're asking yourself, well, why is that?
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:45.880]  It's because China and the rest of the world decided to stop funding the American economy and we're at a place now.
[02:40:45.880 --> 02:40:49.880]  One of the biggest wild cards in all of this has been Germany.
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:57.880]  And recently, because of the revelations that America is spying on Germany and hacking into Merkel's telephone,
[02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:00.880]  Germany is now openly siding with Russia.
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:12.880]  And this is quite interesting because that means that all that gas that Russia controls is now Germany and Russia have formed an axis along with China and Iran that is really insurmountable.
[02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:13.880]  There's no axis.
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:16.880]  There's no combination of countries that's going to fight that.
[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:27.880]  If America aligns itself, let's say, with the Britain and, well, who else is America going to align itself with against China, Russia, Iran and Germany?
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:30.880]  There's no combination of countries that's going to fight that.
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:32.880]  And they all want to get out of the dollar.
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:33.880]  They want it.
[02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:45.880]  But again, there's a globalist program above that to implement all of this, which has meant in the final equation to bring the United States out of its superpower status to be mainly under NATO and the banksters.
[02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:47.880]  This is how we're being brought to our knees.
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:49.880]  Alex, let me cut in for a second.
[02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:59.880]  Because the average American, even people that are making not so much money, they still enjoy an extraordinary quality of life compared to the third world.
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:01.880]  And that's all going to go away overnight.
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:02.880]  Right.
[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:03.880]  That gets blown away.
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:10.880]  So I understand that you're saying, look, there's the globalist layer that's controlling everything in these different countries.
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:11.880]  That's true.
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:20.880]  But for the average American, they don't understand that 80 percent of the world lives much worse lives than even the whole of America.
[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:31.880]  And they don't get that all we really produce now is Hollywood propaganda, military equipment, some tech and a bunch of dollars that are literally stacking up everywhere.
[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:40.880]  And for those that don't know why Mexico is so poor, the one big reason, or Argentina or other places that used to be rich, like Argentina, they allow the same type of scams.
[02:42:40.880 --> 02:42:42.880]  And money devaluation.
[02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:54.880]  This is why those countries are like that, because they allowed political elites to swindle everything so they could all move to Switzerland and Luxembourg.
[02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:55.880]  I mean, this is on record.
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:43:03.880]  And so now our political elite have decided to literally destroy our whole future just so they could do this swindle.
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:05.880]  And I don't know how the elite think they're going to get away with it.
[02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:09.880]  Do you think Max Kaiser, they're going to get away with it?
[02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:12.880]  Well, I know that they think that they will get away with it.
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:26.880]  I know that also if you read some of the press, there are stories out in publications that the elite read, like Vanity Fair or the Harvard Business Review, that are talking openly about, should we be afraid of pitchforks?
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:41.880]  In other words, the top 1% of the top 1% is now openly fearful of there being some kind of moment of clarity amongst the young washed that are going to come chasing them down and hanging them up.
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:51.880]  And there was an essay last week by somebody out in California who wrote a very lengthy essay about the fact that should we be worried about the pitchforks and are we pushing things too far?
[02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:56.880]  They're openly saying, Alex, in the open press, they're saying, are we the elite pushing this too far?
[02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:03.880]  By gobbling up so much of the wealth for really no reason other than that we're greedy, are we pushing this too far?
[02:44:03.880 --> 02:44:05.880]  Are we taking a risk too far?
[02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:07.880]  So they're openly discussing it.
[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:14.880]  And I think the answer is yes, they are, because there's very little recourse for those at the bottom.
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:21.880]  Last time interest rates were this low, Alex, in France was the year of the French Revolution.
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:33.880]  Interest rates, when they get this low, when the economy gets this distorted, when things get this out of whack, people en masse decide to revolt.
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:36.880]  I can't see that not being the case again.
[02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:41.880]  I mean, historically, this is what happens, and this is the inflection point.
[02:44:41.880 --> 02:44:45.880]  I mean, I think there are ways, we've talked about ways you can deal with that.
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:54.880]  There's gold and silver we've talked about, and I believe cryptocurrency is really an unbelievably great way to protect yourself against this.
[02:44:54.880 --> 02:44:56.880]  So that's the only place I see.
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:45:01.880]  Sure, I was about to say, I mean, the revolution is just as dangerous as the implosion.
[02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:09.880]  And there's so many dumb socialists and collectivists and welfare types that are under the control of the big banks that have gotten them dependent.
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:12.880]  So that they can get their corporate welfare.
[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:21.880]  It's the sick alliance, but I don't see the police going along with this and the military when they're losing their pensions as well.
[02:45:21.880 --> 02:45:26.880]  And more and more, we're seeing in Greece and seeing in Spain, the police join the people.
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:29.880]  And I think that's why you see the elite saying, have we gone too far?
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:36.880]  But the worst of the elite, you know, that make 40 to one bets like John Corzine with other people's money are in control.
[02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:39.880]  And so they can't even control themselves.
[02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:42.880]  I don't think anything can stop this now, Max.
[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:44.880]  I really don't.
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:49.880]  Another warning sign is that bankers themselves are committing suicide.
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:57.880]  Just two days ago or yesterday, another JP Morgan banker, he shot his wife and then shot himself.
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:02.880]  And from the indications are that it was just the stress of being in that industry.
[02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:04.880]  They killed themselves.
[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:08.880]  We've seen now, I think, 20 cases in the last six months more than that.
[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:09.880]  Yeah.
[02:46:09.880 --> 02:46:12.880]  I mean, some are directly related.
[02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:21.880]  Some are not, but you're seeing many, many cases where the bankers themselves are at a point where, you know, like, like the elephants before the tsunami, the Indian Ocean tsunami.
[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:29.880]  Remember, they ran away from the tsunami because they instinctively knew what was coming and the dumb tourists ran out into the into the ocean and they all died.
[02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:33.880]  I think these bankers, because they know this industry so well, they know what's coming.
[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:35.880]  And it's so horrific.
[02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:38.880]  They're blowing their brains out now to avoid the rush.
[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:41.880]  And jumping off of their 50 story balconies.
[02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:43.880]  I mean, it's happening right now.
[02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:44.880]  Very creepy.
[02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:53.880]  A lot of people I talked to in the banking industry who have left the banking industry, I asked them, you've had no me, Prince on your show before she was the next Goldman Sachs banker.
[02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:56.880]  And I said, you know, so many bankers are killing themselves these days.
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:46:58.880]  You were a managing director of Goldman Sachs.
[02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:04.880]  If you stayed at Goldman Sachs, would you be in a position of being so stressed out by how badly they're ripping people off?
[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:06.880]  Would you be one of these people that could have blown their brains out?
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:07.880]  Is that one of the reasons you left?
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:09.880]  You said, yeah, that's a great question.
[02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:10.880]  I think that's absolutely true.
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:20.880]  If you stay in these, in these companies, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and you're openly committing a financial holocaust where you're incinerating the net worth of millions.
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:21.880]  So you can get it.
[02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:29.880]  I mean, it's going to come back on you instantly. I mean, look at the Google exec shooting up heroin and dying with some hooker that didn't care about him.
[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:32.880]  I mean, these elites are really not very happy people.
[02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:40.880]  No, I just, you see story after story now being reported in that industry.
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:45.880]  And it's coming to a head all of these different threads.
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:51.880]  And I am surprised myself at the number of suicides in the industry.
[02:47:51.880 --> 02:47:55.880]  Because remember, these are people that are living quite a privileged life.
[02:47:55.880 --> 02:48:01.880]  And for them to suddenly have a crisis of conscience, what their vision of what's coming must be so horrific.
[02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:03.880]  But they would know because they're on the front line.
[02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:12.880]  I say that the reason I live in London is not because I love living in a rainy London, it's because of where you are frontline war reporters.
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:17.880]  This is really the front line in the global financial war.
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:24.880]  And you really feel it here, these bankers in the city of London, they're beginning to lose it every day in the paper.
[02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:26.880]  They have another pedophile scandal in this country.
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:29.880]  The elites are caught now right here in Westminster.
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:36.880]  And in the BBC, hundreds and hundreds in cases now of child rape are being exposed almost on a daily basis.
[02:48:36.880 --> 02:48:39.880]  So they can't contain the snakes in the closet anymore.
[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:42.880]  They're coming out every night on the BBC.
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:46.880]  And you just see in people's faces, they're starting to collectively lose it.
[02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:53.880]  They know that this what's going on in Palestine with Israel that they support is a black mark on their soul.
[02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:56.880]  And they just, they try to drink away their problems.
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:48:59.880]  People are openly drunk all day long in the street.
[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:02.880]  It's become like Sodom and Gomorrah over here.
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:06.880]  Well, and then separately you've got them funding Al Qaeda to run around and blow everything up.
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:10.880]  I mean, the whole world is literally starting to go up in flames.
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:12.880]  We're almost out of time, Max Kaiser.
[02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:19.880]  When we come back, well, about two minutes, I'm going to play this key LaRaza report that Darren McBrain has put together with some of the background history of it.
[02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:24.880]  I'll be on the nightly news tonight with more to understand how the government's created race-based policies.
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:27.880]  But tell me about MaxCoin and MaxKaiser.com.
[02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:29.880]  I know you've got a new invention out.
[02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:33.880]  Oh yeah, MaxCoin Silver Crypto Bullion.
[02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:37.880]  So this is, you know, I started this site, StartJoin, which is crowdfunding.
[02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:46.880]  And then one of our members, a guy named Mike Murphy, he put up this idea with a silver one ounce coin that has a hologram of some cryptocurrency attached to it.
[02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:51.880]  And we sold almost $52,000 worth in 12 days.
[02:49:51.880 --> 02:50:01.880]  So my goal is if we get to 100,000 sold in the next 18 days, I'm going to come down there to Austin personally in August when I'm in the New York.
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:06.880]  Yeah, that was the plan. You talked about this before to then go down to South America to make this film.
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:10.880]  Okay, well, it's going to hit 100,000, Max. So I expect you to do this.
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:13.880]  Yeah, we'll come down there and visit you in Austin. We get to 100,000 on this.
[02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:17.880]  Hopefully, put the page up on your site there. It's MaxCoin Silver Crypto Bullion.
[02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:22.880]  You get silver plus some crypto, which I think going forward is a great plan.
[02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:28.880]  You have the silver, which we know silver and gold is the, everyone talks about is the place to be when you have hyper...
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:31.880]  And the way to boost it is tied into crypto. I think it's very exciting.
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:37.880]  I want you to get into crypto. I mean, finally, Alex, I think you're one of the last guys to get in on this.
[02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:41.880]  I want you to be in on the crypto revolution. It's very important.
[02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:44.880]  I know. I know. If I start getting into it, then I'll be obsessed with it.
[02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:48.880]  So I just don't even think about money is the issue other than the overall system.
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:51.880]  I can only be focused on certain things. That's prosecuting the info war.
[02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:55.880]  But it's very interesting, Max. We're going to come back, talk about a little bit more with Max Kaiser.
[02:50:55.880 --> 02:50:59.880]  I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us and we got that loving LaRaza clip.

[02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:27.880]  Remember they used to say the Federal Reserve is federal.
[02:54:27.880 --> 02:54:31.880]  There is no new world order. There is no plan for a casual society.
[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:36.880]  There is no NSA spying. There is no, there is no, there is no, there is no.
[02:54:36.880 --> 02:54:41.880]  Well, no more. It's out in the open globalist and you're going to commit all your crimes
[02:54:41.880 --> 02:54:45.880]  and your false flag terror and all of it in front of everybody but naked now.
[02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:48.880]  With your big old bobo's hanging out in the wind.
[02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:51.880]  Max Kaiser finishing up in about the minute and a half we have
[02:54:51.880 --> 02:54:55.880]  before I go to this Darren McBreen report with some low lights from the
[02:54:55.880 --> 02:54:57.880]  Hispanic Ku Klux Klan in my view.
[02:54:57.880 --> 02:55:00.880]  Mecha Loraza federally funded through Ford Foundation.
[02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:02.880]  And to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:55:02.880 --> 02:55:06.880]  That's even the news today running around screaming down with the U.S.
[02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:09.880]  waving Mexican flags. Before we do that, tell us a little bit more
[02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:13.880]  about cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, where you see it all going.
[02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:19.880]  Yeah, well cryptocurrency is the way to move money around
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:22.880]  which you can't do with gold and silver.
[02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:25.880]  In other words, if I have to move my gold and silver, it's very heavy,
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:26.880]  you can't move it around.
[02:55:26.880 --> 02:55:29.880]  Cryptocurrency, you can put it on your thumb drive or you can actually put it
[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:31.880]  into your memory and just go anywhere in the world.
[02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:34.880]  And now you've taken your money with you, so to speak.
[02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:37.880]  It's becoming a huge business all over the world.
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:42.880]  And the Max Coin Silver crypto bullion, I'm doing this crowdfunding campaign
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:44.880]  on my site, Start Join.
[02:55:44.880 --> 02:55:48.880]  And everyone who joins, Start Join, we shower them with cryptocurrency.
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:52.880]  You get free Start Coin, which is our own cryptocurrency.
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:56.880]  We just shower you with free cryptocurrency starting in 10 days or so.
[02:55:56.880 --> 02:55:58.880]  We just shower you with free money.
[02:55:58.880 --> 02:56:02.880]  And the idea is you're going to redeploy that money on these projects.
[02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:07.880]  So if one of your listeners wants to do a project like, oh, I need $200
[02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:11.880]  to go get some Alex Jones stickers to put all over the neighborhood,
[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:13.880]  they can crowd-funded on Start Join.
[02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:15.880]  We help crowd-funded with our own cryptocurrency.
[02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:16.880]  Max, it's very interesting.
[02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:18.880]  And unfortunately, I'm out of time.
[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:19.880]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:20.880]  Thank you so much for the time.
[02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:46.880]  We'll see you in the next video.
[02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:56.880]  We'll see you in the next video.
[02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:18.880]  It's not simply because they just want to exploit us.
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:19.880]  Let me tell you why.
[02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:21.880]  Because on this planet right now,
[02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:26.880]  of 6 billion people at the forefront of the revolutionary movement
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:27.880]  is the RASA.
[02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:29.880]  When you go to Vegas, we're ready.
[02:57:29.880 --> 02:57:34.880]  We're breeding by the chains.
[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:36.880]  Mill Gates funds this.
[02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:37.880]  This is America.
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:38.880]  Look to color.
[02:57:38.880 --> 02:57:39.880]  You're right.
[02:57:39.880 --> 02:57:42.880]  You don't mean up here.
[02:57:42.880 --> 02:57:43.880]  You're white.
[02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:44.880]  You don't belong here.
[02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:46.880]  The elite one is fighting with each other,
[02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:54.880]  not going after them.
[02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:55.880]  Miller Brewing funds this.
[02:57:55.880 --> 02:57:57.880]  Look at the list of funds for RASA.
[02:57:57.880 --> 02:58:00.880]  This is about ensuring that we increase our numbers.
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:02.880]  That we increase our numbers at every level.
[02:58:02.880 --> 02:58:04.880]  And let me tell you, we can't go back.
[02:58:04.880 --> 02:58:06.880]  You know, we're in a civil war.
[02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:07.880]  This is America.
[02:58:07.880 --> 02:58:08.880]  White.
[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:10.880]  You do want to be America.
[02:58:10.880 --> 02:58:12.880]  Go back to your work.
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:15.880]  And again, it's racially based.
[02:58:15.880 --> 02:58:17.880]  And the people that were here before,
[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:19.880]  they're just not going to get up and leave.
[02:58:19.880 --> 02:58:20.880]  Hey, here you go.
[02:58:20.880 --> 02:58:21.880]  Hey, here you go.
[02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:22.880]  Hey, here you go.
[02:58:22.880 --> 02:58:23.880]  Hey, here you go.
[02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:24.880]  I live in America.
[02:58:24.880 --> 02:58:25.880]  I live in America.
[02:58:25.880 --> 02:58:26.880]  Yeah.
[02:58:26.880 --> 02:58:28.880]  You think we have kids?
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:30.880]  Folks, I'll see you.
[02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:32.880]  You can start this war, believe me.
[02:58:32.880 --> 02:58:34.880]  Folks, I'll see you on Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:34.880 --> 02:58:35.880]  with a live Sunday show.
[02:58:35.880 --> 02:58:37.880]  It'll be live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:37.880 --> 02:58:38.880]  Nightly News Tonight.
[02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:39.880]  I'll be on that as well.
[02:58:39.880 --> 02:58:40.880]  7 o'clock, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:58:40.880 --> 02:58:41.880]  You know the kids from G.C.?
[02:58:41.880 --> 02:58:43.880]  You gotta hand it to Bill Gates' dad at Planned Parenthood.
[02:58:43.880 --> 02:58:44.880]  Visit GCNLive.com.
[02:58:44.880 --> 02:58:46.880]  By the way, they're shooting all these people up
[02:58:46.880 --> 02:59:15.880]  with the vaccines, killing them right now.
[02:59:16.880 --> 02:59:17.880]  I think this is powerful.
[02:59:17.880 --> 02:59:21.880]  I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals,
[02:59:21.880 --> 02:59:25.880]  and the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[02:59:25.880 --> 02:59:30.880]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
