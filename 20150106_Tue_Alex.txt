[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:33.640]  Texas Alex Jones well I was a good boy today I spent hours at home not
[00:33.640 --> 00:38.960]  exercising but getting ready for this broadcast and I spent a good hour here
[00:38.960 --> 00:44.080]  going over the giant stacks of news and I did something I haven't done for
[00:44.080 --> 00:47.280]  probably six months because quite frankly I just got to the point where I
[00:47.280 --> 00:51.560]  was overwhelmed with the amount of information in the past I would come
[00:51.560 --> 00:57.880]  through and in email or text to the crew video links articles and they would
[00:57.880 --> 01:03.040]  just basically print me everything off of several dozen major websites where I
[01:03.040 --> 01:07.760]  come in here each day there's about 500 articles 400 to 500 articles stacked in
[01:07.760 --> 01:14.680]  front of me you're a TV viewer we can show you what's in the stacks today now
[01:14.680 --> 01:19.840]  in the old days I would sit in front of a computer with the radio producer three
[01:19.840 --> 01:23.200]  hours before the show reading articles and printing them because there's no
[01:23.200 --> 01:27.040]  way to surf around quick enough and to remember the order of them when they're
[01:27.040 --> 01:31.840]  on a computer tablet or computer screen so I physically print them so that we
[01:31.840 --> 01:37.440]  also have a record sometimes when they pull articles but the last six months or
[01:37.440 --> 01:41.120]  so taking care of sick family other things kind of took me out of the game
[01:41.120 --> 01:44.080]  partially I got to where some days I'd come in here and only look at maybe a
[01:44.080 --> 01:49.960]  hundred articles not 200 dot 300 on 400 but over the weekend I kind of got back
[01:49.960 --> 01:58.080]  in my old habit of becoming news obsessed and so you're going to get today
[01:58.080 --> 02:03.800]  if the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek or to use the politically incorrect
[02:03.800 --> 02:10.240]  colloquial well I just won't use it I'm going to go over all this news and the
[02:10.240 --> 02:14.160]  reason it's important is I've had time to not just go through the stack and
[02:14.160 --> 02:21.400]  cover it randomly off of what I think is interesting but to tie stacks in
[02:21.400 --> 02:27.400]  together just on what's come out the last day or two to show you thematic
[02:27.400 --> 02:34.800]  things that are going on there's a couple different reasons they lowered
[02:34.800 --> 02:39.880]  oil prices and of course it shows that it's rigged that it's the fixes in
[02:39.880 --> 02:46.520]  bankrupt Russia shut down US oil development but also and I knew it was
[02:46.520 --> 02:51.760]  coming I'm not going to say I told you so carbon taxes kind of did right there
[02:51.760 --> 02:58.640]  carbon taxes and new gas taxes that's one reason they're doing it and they're
[02:58.640 --> 03:02.920]  now proposing it get ready huge announcements all over the world that
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.280]  they're banning fireplaces told you that was coming it's in the global UN
[03:06.280 --> 03:15.040]  treating that's what treaties like SPP and the trans Texas corridor and the
[03:15.040 --> 03:19.560]  Asia Pacific partnerships and the Trans Pacific partnerships it's why they're
[03:19.560 --> 03:24.600]  all important because they put them in place and five ten years later you're
[03:24.600 --> 03:29.680]  living under a jack there's a reason the code enforces where badges and guns
[03:29.680 --> 03:35.840]  now and drive police vehicles because they're coming are they my enemy
[03:35.840 --> 03:39.320]  individually no they're a bunch of brainwashed people that just like somebody
[03:39.320 --> 03:42.960]  running slaves on a plantation 200 years ago might have been a good Christian
[03:42.960 --> 03:46.240]  and took care of their wife and family and gave money to charity they really
[03:46.240 --> 03:51.800]  believe black people weren't humans well these code enforcers on average really
[03:51.800 --> 03:55.760]  believe they're saving the earth arresting you if you cut down a tree on
[03:55.760 --> 04:00.160]  your property even though it's gonna fall on your house my parents try to get
[04:00.160 --> 04:03.680]  permission to cut a tree off their house that's already collapsing a big oak
[04:03.680 --> 04:09.520]  tree they told them no we might just make you move out then they said well
[04:09.520 --> 04:15.320]  just pay us seventy five thousand dollars for the mitigation and we ordered
[04:15.320 --> 04:20.320]  you to cut it so my dad spent six months threatening to sue him and getting
[04:20.320 --> 04:24.080]  lawyers involved in tens of thousands where they finally backed off and said
[04:24.080 --> 04:29.560]  you know what just pay us a few thousand for our inspectors coming out and you
[04:29.560 --> 04:36.520]  can cut the tree I'm living it and so are you now see I haven't even hit two

[12:00.840 --> 12:06.560]  introducing it where baner back in the 90s was caught handing out tobacco
[12:06.560 --> 12:15.280]  company checks to Republican members of the house on the floor right before a
[12:15.280 --> 12:22.200]  critical tobacco vote you can't make this stuff up this is the guy that loves
[12:22.200 --> 12:28.160]  Obama hangs out vacations and plays golf with him who won't repeal Obamacare who

[12:32.520 --> 12:40.680]  Benghazi and the IRS gate investigations here is John Banner caught bribing on the
[12:40.680 --> 12:45.720]  house floor but come on we already knew that baner joined forces with the dark
[12:45.720 --> 12:51.800]  side long ago well I had heard that there was one particular member that was
[12:51.800 --> 12:56.200]  passing out check on the house floor why they asked me to give out a half a
[12:56.200 --> 13:01.760]  dozen checks quickly before we got to the end of a month and I comply I did it
[13:01.760 --> 13:06.280]  on the house floor which I regret should not have done it's not a violation of the
[13:06.280 --> 13:10.840]  house rules but it's a practice that's going on here for a long time we have
[13:10.840 --> 13:16.840]  stopped it this is just not something I have so that was in 1995 obviously he was
[13:16.840 --> 13:21.320]  very friendly then with the coming corporatocracy but go back to that video
[13:21.320 --> 13:26.840]  he also looks like he was very friendly with the wolves of Wall Street if you
[13:26.840 --> 13:32.720]  know what I mean but we'll see if is actually going to get replaced or if he
[13:32.720 --> 13:38.600]  will be speaker of the house for a third term yeah John Banner looks like a fun
[13:38.600 --> 13:45.080]  guy to go to Vegas with not a fun guy to run the country that's essentially what
[13:45.080 --> 13:50.200]  he does with Obama he's letting Obama act as a dictator we're gonna get more
[13:50.200 --> 13:54.360]  into that coming up we're gonna tell you what's behind one of the big issues
[13:54.360 --> 13:59.200]  behind the current drop in oil prices remember Lindsey Williams two years ago
[13:59.200 --> 14:03.800]  with his big oil insiders that I know that is I've confirmed their identities
[14:03.800 --> 14:10.040]  dr. Montee actually called some of them up when he was told kind of off record
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.520]  by Williams who they were and confirmed it I confirmed it separately that when
[14:14.520 --> 14:19.520]  they dropped the oil prices to bankrupt Russia and to bring in the carbon taxes
[14:19.520 --> 14:24.760]  that's the signal for the big collapse to come after about a year of that and
[14:24.760 --> 14:30.320]  that's now what all the big billionaires when I say all of them I have a stack of
[14:30.320 --> 14:35.040]  news articles today where they're saying get ready 11 predictions of economic
[14:35.040 --> 14:43.640]  disaster in 2015 from top experts all over the globe that's coming up newly
[14:43.640 --> 14:48.440]  renamed high-fructose corn syrup contains toxic mercury all over the place
[14:48.440 --> 14:51.240]  consumers won't buy stuff with high-fructose corn syrup knowing how
[14:51.240 --> 14:55.440]  deadly it is not just with all the poisonous things that are in it like
[14:55.440 --> 14:59.960]  lead mercury at high levels that precipitate out in the corn from the
[14:59.960 --> 15:04.440]  bad soils and the toxic fertilizer but also what it does to the pancreas with
[15:04.440 --> 15:10.920]  pancreas cancer exploding and obesity exploding but now they've changed the
[15:10.920 --> 15:15.680]  name just like they did MSG to confuse the public Anthony Gutiarty's report is
[15:15.680 --> 15:20.440]  so important it's on info wars.com and we're gonna retweet that right now
[15:20.440 --> 15:24.600]  because it's so important please get it out everyone you know also FBI says
[15:24.600 --> 15:28.120]  search warrants not needed to use stingrays in public after the Senate
[15:28.120 --> 15:32.680]  began investigation the FBI went from three months ago saying it doesn't
[15:32.680 --> 15:36.760]  exist or they don't know whose cell phone towers they are to saying there
[15:36.760 --> 15:42.920]  are some homeland security and we'll do whatever we want scum again as a rule
[15:42.920 --> 15:48.640]  lying to you folks as a rule scooping it all up illegally now they get caught
[15:48.640 --> 15:52.480]  they go oh we think it's legal to insider trade in Congress we think it's
[15:52.480 --> 15:56.760]  legal to handout checks we think it's legal to scoop up all your data and put
[15:56.760 --> 16:02.840]  it through a database and and add whatever we want CDC flu season continues
[16:02.840 --> 16:07.280]  to worsen could peak this month ABC news we're gonna break that down I can't
[16:07.280 --> 16:13.120]  breathe protesters invade 100-year-old vets ceremony
[16:13.840 --> 16:18.760]  unbelievable just to show I mean these groups have got to be hired to discredit
[16:18.760 --> 16:22.880]  anybody that protests police brutality I mean you couldn't come up with worse
[16:22.880 --> 16:28.680]  stuff going to the dead cops funerals and you know chanting and taking it over
[16:28.680 --> 16:32.440]  I mean just but unfortunately I've watched these people I don't think it's
[16:32.440 --> 16:38.880]  staged I think these are just absolutely an example of modern progressive
[16:38.880 --> 16:43.520]  brainwashing and the entitlement society oh World War two that's having a
[16:43.520 --> 16:47.600]  ceremony let's go get in their face and blame them for cops shooting black
[16:47.600 --> 16:51.960]  people by the way there's a new national study out showing that police are
[16:51.960 --> 16:58.640]  many times more likely to shoot whites than they are blacks and I've seen that
[16:58.640 --> 17:02.880]  following the news day by day that whites don't tend to sue whites don't
[17:02.880 --> 17:07.840]  tend to make a big deal out of it that's just a fact and so in a way cops
[17:07.840 --> 17:12.480]  shoot whites more often what's happening is police just won't respond to
[17:12.480 --> 17:19.040]  predominantly black areas now I mean cops are so politically correct ladies
[17:19.040 --> 17:23.760]  and gentlemen I'm gonna be breaking all and that's what Charles Barkley said he
[17:23.760 --> 17:29.160]  said do you really want the cops to never be in your neighborhood period because
[17:29.160 --> 17:34.200]  that's where all this is going and I'm not lionizing as you know the police I
[17:34.200 --> 17:39.000]  am demonizing the federalization the globalization because it is demonic
[17:39.000 --> 17:46.880]  politically but just hating the average police officer out of the blue when
[17:46.880 --> 17:50.600]  they're part of this whole sick process just like we are is a cop out is a
[17:50.600 --> 17:55.800]  scapegoat and is what the globalists are financing they're financing a war with
[17:55.800 --> 18:00.800]  the police well I can intellectually tell you how that's bad but I just default

[35:54.560 --> 35:59.200]  counter and move again we battle again it's the eternal fight it's the animating
[35:59.200 --> 36:05.040]  contest of liberty the Thomas Jefferson dubbed it the reason people feel so dead
[36:05.040 --> 36:10.040]  is you're not meant to watch ESPN all day and waddle back and forth from work
[36:10.040 --> 36:16.360]  not being a real human I like it at the people that weigh 500 pounds and are
[36:16.360 --> 36:19.680]  totally unhappy hey I've gotten overweight before not like that but I got
[36:19.680 --> 36:24.600]  about 60 70 pounds overweight I still haven't lost all I've lost about 75% of
[36:24.600 --> 36:30.400]  it I'm shooting to lose the rest of it this month but it doesn't mean that I
[36:30.400 --> 36:34.440]  can't grasp the fact that I was unhealthy and out of shape because I got so
[36:34.440 --> 36:37.560]  focused on fighting the New World Order I was kind of the opposite I got so
[36:37.560 --> 36:41.840]  focused like a monk or something only thinking about the New World Order only
[36:41.840 --> 36:44.600]  trying to learn about it only trying to fight it that I got to where there was
[36:44.600 --> 36:49.080]  no play for Jack no fun for Jack no going out and have a good time no
[36:49.080 --> 36:54.800]  exercising almost nothing I'm going to hike maybe once a week maybe on a long
[36:54.800 --> 37:00.200]  swim once a week when it was warm turn into job of the hike I've dialed that
[37:00.200 --> 37:04.320]  back a lot and I'm going the rest of the way it's the same thing as a culture so
[37:04.320 --> 37:09.680]  when I'm up here on my horse saying do this do that I'm not up here telling you
[37:09.680 --> 37:16.080]  you're bad I'm telling you you're great you have amazing potential and I'm
[37:16.080 --> 37:19.560]  angry about the globalist and I take it personal their scientific plan and I'm
[37:19.560 --> 37:24.440]  countering them I'm going to finish up with an anti-state articles and I'm
[37:24.440 --> 37:28.000]  going to tie it in this is just the stuff today and I'm going to tie it in
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.200]  with what's really going on with the loyal the low oil prices and more then
[37:33.200 --> 37:40.520]  I'm getting in to the pedophile kingdom that runs Congress runs the EU and runs
[37:40.520 --> 37:44.200]  the British monarchy and Parliament it's come out in the biggest British
[37:44.200 --> 37:49.440]  newspapers that at least a third of the members of Parliament are in part of
[37:49.440 --> 37:53.800]  pedophile networks and I'm not talking about guys going out with 17-year-old
[37:53.800 --> 37:59.640]  women there's always an extreme end of things you know calling it pedophilia
[37:59.640 --> 38:04.440]  when you're 20 dating a 17-year-old I don't think that's the case and most
[38:04.440 --> 38:07.560]  people in polls don't know I'm talking about five-year-old boys being
[38:07.560 --> 38:12.400]  strangled and raped and run over with cars six-year-old girls having their
[38:12.400 --> 38:17.440]  throat slit being grabbed out of their backyard and disappearing on a private
[38:17.440 --> 38:23.480]  jet to the Caribbean and the next thing you know
[38:25.600 --> 38:31.400]  world leaders are standing over you that's who needs to be saved and that's
[38:31.400 --> 38:36.880]  any time I have a spark of fear in my psyche about who I'm going up against I
[38:36.880 --> 38:40.200]  think about all those kids they're having their way with and not just the
[38:40.200 --> 38:43.400]  little three or four five-year-old that people are so upset about it should be
[38:43.400 --> 38:49.240]  all the hundreds of millions every few years worldwide and the 55 million I
[38:49.240 --> 38:53.960]  keep saying 52 million it's like 55 to 6 million abortions in this country since
[38:53.960 --> 38:58.480]  Roe v. Wade saying they're not kids either the minute we did that folks now
[38:58.480 --> 39:01.840]  it's infanticide now it's kill babies after they're born now it's kill old
[39:01.840 --> 39:06.720]  people now it's put the veterans on death list young veterans not just old
[39:06.720 --> 39:13.320]  ones that's bad enough do not treat do not give care list we are evil we are
[39:13.320 --> 39:19.320]  run by evil we must admit we're evil or there's no way to dial this back and the
[39:19.320 --> 39:24.200]  bottom's gonna fall out and we're inches away from the rusty bottom of this
[39:24.200 --> 39:31.320]  mineshaft elevator that goes down over a mile we're up at the top you think it's
[39:31.320 --> 39:35.840]  scary now just 50 60 feet down the mine at the elevator and the winds blowing
[39:35.840 --> 39:41.480]  through it's all dark and there's cobwebs you think it's scary up here we're
[39:41.480 --> 39:46.560]  only in the entrance of the cave and that rusty bottom is starting to break and
[39:46.560 --> 39:50.280]  cringe and the new old orders jumping up and down trying to break it we're in
[39:50.280 --> 39:53.600]  the elevator with a big old devil it's just jumping up and down going when
[39:53.600 --> 39:57.920]  this bottom comes out and when I had your protection goes up I'm gonna take
[39:57.920 --> 40:02.440]  you to the bottom of this pit and you're gonna wish you were dead so you just get
[40:02.440 --> 40:06.040]  ready for the moment this bottom falls out because I'm taking you and your whole
[40:06.040 --> 40:12.920]  family down there with me forever you gonna do something for the bottom falls
[40:12.920 --> 40:16.560]  out you're gonna get ready you're gonna warn people we may not be able to stop
[40:16.560 --> 40:21.360]  the bottom falling out in this worldwide culture the Germans couldn't stop
[40:21.360 --> 40:27.800]  Hitler coming to power and when the war was over 21 million of more dead we
[40:27.800 --> 40:31.560]  always talk about people Hitler killed and we should but how about what the
[40:31.560 --> 40:37.040]  Germans paid for not doing enough all those tens of millions that went along
[40:37.040 --> 40:43.880]  with Hitler thought they were safe doing it lost everything the Soviets lost 22
[40:43.880 --> 40:48.720]  million fighting the Nazis 20 as far as I'm concerned the US wasn't even involved
[40:48.720 --> 40:52.640]  in World War two yes we were involved in the Pacific yes we were involved and
[40:52.640 --> 40:58.600]  that's an overstatement in Europe but we only lost 300 almost 400,000 how about
[40:58.600 --> 41:07.080]  21 million on one side 22 million on the Russian side look it up 22 million you
[41:07.080 --> 41:13.760]  think those were some battles you think those were some think that was fun you
[41:13.760 --> 41:21.840]  think Leningrad was fun Stalingrad change the name mid-fight
[41:21.840 --> 41:28.000]  this way about four million people military and civilian died in that
[41:28.000 --> 41:36.360]  battle that's a lot more scary than Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit huh millions
[41:36.360 --> 41:40.640]  of men in uniforms killing each other toe-to-toe a little more scary than
[41:40.640 --> 41:45.440]  Freddie Krueger isn't it and once it gets let out it's not gonna stop it's
[41:45.440 --> 41:50.680]  gonna be billions and all you kiss-ass trendies and people out there all your
[41:50.680 --> 41:57.560]  little baubles and festoonery aren't gonna mean Jack squat once the gates open
[41:58.400 --> 42:04.960]  I've seen beyond the gate I know what lies behind it and all the evil you see
[42:04.960 --> 42:12.560]  today is only the first breeze of the hurricane of the Maelstrom of the typhoon
[42:12.560 --> 42:25.760]  breath you are warned and forward the gates of hell and the great black chains
[42:25.760 --> 42:38.600]  are beginning to move the glint is in the enforcers eye the computer is there
[42:38.600 --> 42:43.720]  to make the enforcer carry out the great oppression for they themselves are
[42:43.720 --> 42:54.400]  oppressed so EPA's wood burning stove band goes into effect nationwide it's
[42:54.400 --> 43:00.360]  not a law it's a UN treaty that wasn't even put into place in 92 but it's
[43:00.360 --> 43:04.320]  being operated under kind of like the president's opening the borders up
[43:04.320 --> 43:10.800]  without any law and no one's standing in his way it's called dictatorship of the
[43:10.800 --> 43:16.520]  UN and the global government and the president and others are just John
[43:16.520 --> 43:22.520]  Banner and others are just delivery boys Aaron boys to quote apocalypse now
[43:22.520 --> 43:30.520]  sent to collected debt by a grocer who are you I'm an army officer no you're
[43:30.520 --> 43:36.480]  not I'm an assassin you're not even that you're a grocer an Aaron boys sent to
[43:36.480 --> 43:43.000]  collected debt California governor tathans climate change goals
[43:43.000 --> 43:48.720]  ratcheting it down everyone will feel the green police now and he says his
[43:48.720 --> 43:53.720]  president it would be his goal just as the Pope said last week to deliver us
[43:53.720 --> 43:58.080]  under the UN system of total surveillance
[43:58.080 --> 44:03.640]  huh here's another article out of reason in joyless nanny state called
[44:03.640 --> 44:09.880]  America government prohibits sledding saying it's dangerous first they ban
[44:09.880 --> 44:15.560]  dodgeball then tag then running at most public schools now they move against
[44:15.560 --> 44:20.880]  football they never want you to learn confidence they never want you to learn
[44:20.880 --> 44:24.640]  strength not even in limited areas like military or police now because that's
[44:24.640 --> 44:29.440]  to be phased out for the computers for the robot enforcers it's all been
[44:29.440 --> 44:33.080]  announced and it will all happen unless you admit it's happening and say no to
[44:33.080 --> 44:38.360]  it but if we can't admit it's happening well then we can't oh the drone pilots
[44:38.360 --> 44:42.960]  are depressors on enough of them so they're going pilot list this year it's
[44:42.960 --> 44:56.360]  being announced today the robots won't get tired see if you won't wake up when
[44:56.360 --> 45:01.360]  I'm being serious on my delivery I'll deliver I'll deliver the serious news
[45:01.360 --> 45:06.320]  accurately but from the position of the enemy from the position of their spirit
[45:06.320 --> 45:12.800]  from the position of their enjoyment just like Gruber and in all these other
[45:12.800 --> 45:17.080]  globalists like to brag about how stupid you are of course there's death
[45:17.080 --> 45:20.480]  panels and of course we're gonna kill people because it makes them feel
[45:20.480 --> 45:24.840]  powerful doing that to you and your family so if you want me to talk to you
[45:24.840 --> 45:31.520]  like they do I will okay don't worry don't worry you'll be alone it's dead
[45:31.520 --> 45:36.720]  when they're done suck dry and they'll be laughing because it's what you want

[47:28.560 --> 47:33.160]  thinking of all too many government entities these days and it's why local
[47:33.160 --> 47:37.400]  officials not servants are increasingly likely to shut down the
[47:37.400 --> 47:42.520]  neighborhood sledding hill according to the associated press sledding
[47:42.520 --> 47:47.560]  prohibitions are more and more common that's right being out after dark is

[50:01.200 --> 50:04.880]  that you will keep your legs slammed together as they make seats smaller and
[50:04.880 --> 50:12.080]  as they make airline seats smaller it's all part of going after big people but

[1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:32.200]  trendies pull me a Watson's article from six seven years ago about Google

[1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:42.200]  month ago where the smart TV that Samsung says yes we're watching and

[1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:30.760]  well have a electro magnetic cells in our brains that interface with the Sun
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:34.840]  and with electromagnetic fields and that those are being manipulated by DARPA I
[1:02:34.840 --> 1:02:41.880]  mean DARPA said that and I read that in the Baltimore Sun in 1998 and I read it
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:44.800]  hundreds of publications since then I just read hundreds of articles every day
[1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:50.920]  and it was back in the news last week that all seals have magnetic brains off
[1:02:50.920 --> 1:02:54.800]  and have natural GPS and they think humans have them and they think humans
[1:02:54.800 --> 1:03:00.680]  have about two eyeballs they think Moses was a human they think the skies blue

[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:11.760]  is pointing out what's going on and I use a few examples that everybody knows
[1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:20.120]  about Tuskegee experiments and glowing cats and glowing monkeys and spider
[1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:25.040]  goats and then the young Turks God bless them because they're talented smart people

[1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:35.400]  together make fun of me it sounds funny to talk about glowing cats and HIV and
[1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:41.360]  pharmacological corn and spider goats but see it's not funny and when your kid

[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:56.360]  vacation with who they stay with hundreds of times who Prince Charles's
[1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:00.760]  brother stays with who the Queen hangs out with and there's so many of these
[1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:07.760]  people who is a convicted pedophile and now it's coming out had sex slaves in
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:16.080]  the Caribbean in dungeons now we've told you for years this is going on and a
[1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:19.680]  lot of it keeps coming out but but when I think about the sheer amount of proof
[1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:27.720]  with Dinecore subsidiaries the UN it's just hard for me to believe there's
[1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:32.560]  this many ghouls but it's all coming out the other big question is why is it all
[1:10:32.560 --> 1:10:37.720]  coming out now so that's coming up we've also got a very important article by
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:41.320]  Kit Daniels the worst of Obama stage photo ops that gets into the how they
[1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:47.400]  create imaging US drone fleet at breaking point over operator shortage now
[1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:51.600]  there's not even soap as the president of Venezuela as the China to save
[1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:56.280]  socialist utopia of Venezuela as it collapses Samsung smart TV record the
[1:10:56.280 --> 1:11:00.200]  personal conversations and sends them to third parties I mentioned that from a
[1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:08.720]  few months ago we wrote about we also wrote about it back in 2008 2006 companies
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:14.760]  try to cover up move to watch consumers via TVs Google patent seeks to
[1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:19.920]  transmit your cell phone voice to law enforcement without warrant mainstream
[1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:23.880]  media finally admits that television can spy on you it's not that it can it is
[1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:31.680]  that dovetails with the announcement by entertainment weekly the next level of
[1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:41.520]  television rolling out next week your television without asking is going to
[1:11:41.520 --> 1:11:50.200]  interface with the federally globally mandated light bulbs and track
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:58.480]  everything you do the circle is now complete who was it it was a whole
[1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:02.600]  bunch of publications went through all the wildest stuff I've covered not that
[1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:07.240]  I said I just covered it back then it was in Pentagon and DARPA press releases
[1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:14.280]  wasn't even secret but they knew it would sound crazy to listeners it was an AP
[1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:17.960]  like five years ago to they announced in Minnesota that oh there's a grant to
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:22.720]  local police departments in Minneapolis and St. Paul where new light bulbs will
[1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:28.080]  interface with the police computers but only some in testing areas and but the
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:33.560]  light bulbs can also send out a flicker rate found to soothe the officers during
[1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:38.680]  troubling times the one in mind control where would you stick it you stick it in
[1:12:38.680 --> 1:12:42.680]  the police department first folks you're not in Kansas they can make you have a
[1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:48.000]  convulsion with flicker rates on televisions 50 years ago they did test
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:55.160]  in Japan and limited on one cable system in New York 14 years ago no 15 years ago
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:13:01.640]  was in two to two thousand causing 100 plus thousand convulsions in Tokyo alone
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:07.600]  and causing almost as many in New York activist post for an article 10 modern
[1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:11.440]  methods of mind control if you don't believe me Google Pokemon causes
[1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:16.880]  convulsions the red eyes would gleam in the little monster and the children
[1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:22.400]  would begin flopping everywhere including biting their little tongues off now I
[1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:32.200]  know this sounds insane because it is trippy oh see it's trippy the trendies
[1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:35.840]  that are all under their tech the hell there's the band Pokemon episode that
[1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:39.040]  gave children seizures see there's the headline let me go back though to the

[1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:23.220]  apology from MSNBC I'm trying to go from memory I got attacked a bunch Google
[1:14:23.220 --> 1:14:26.520]  Alex Jones thinks light bulbs are controlling you or light bulbs are
[1:14:26.520 --> 1:14:29.840]  watching you or light bulbs are controlling your computers I just want
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:34.880]  to show people how it was so funny even though they trimmed in the videos they
[1:14:34.880 --> 1:14:38.520]  play and remember who did it it's a couple publications in TV to where it
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:41.800]  just had me going the light bulbs will interfaces your computer and are used
[1:14:41.800 --> 1:14:45.120]  for flicker rates for mind control and they just play that it sounds like I'm
[1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:51.600]  totally crazy and I don't care because I'm told the truth they didn't show there
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:55.400]  it is Alex Jones light bulbs are spying on you yeah that's just a site making a
[1:14:55.400 --> 1:15:03.240]  joke out of them but then that gets picked up it's so funny though it's so
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:07.800]  funny that we told you a decade before anybody and before they came out and
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:10.880]  wired magazine three years ago and said yeah your washing machine is watching
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:17.480]  and listening to you we can break I mean I remember we first broke open and a
[1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:21.800]  scientific Atlantic cable box and had a hidden microphone in it like 17 years
[1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:27.680]  ago I got death threats over it full grown men calling up going you went too
[1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:32.120]  far you little bleeper one more time and I'm telling you it's over for you and
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:36.920]  your family you shut your mouth about what the they had a backlash on access
[1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:41.560]  television I broke that thing open it back then you know 1998 or so you
[1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:44.440]  weren't supposed to know they were listening to you before there was voice
[1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:49.760]  activation all that it was a big deal there was a microphone in it there was
[1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:54.280]  a we got to find that tape but see now this is like a big deal there's a
[1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:58.480]  microphone my connect can look through walls I can sit on the toilet in another
[1:15:58.480 --> 1:16:07.640]  room and still play it sees me my my Xbox my see how it's oh it's so fun your
[1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:11.760]  TV interfaces with your live bulbs the government just so happened to mandate a
[1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:17.040]  decade ago that just happened to become law three years ago worldwide there's no
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:23.040]  global government though they've got it this unification this continuity of
[1:16:23.040 --> 1:16:29.000]  agenda down to that point here's the toll free number for first-time callers on
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:45.280]  any of these subjects 800 259 9231 800 259 9231 so 800 259 9231 on this live
[1:16:45.280 --> 1:17:07.000]  Tuesday the sixth day of January 2015 now let's get into the energy sector your
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:12.880]  energy prices are going up on almost every front except oil and that's because
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:19.840]  Saudi Arabia and OPEC want to have a corner on the oil market to charge at
[1:17:19.840 --> 1:17:28.600]  least $10 is what they see the UN says up to $18 a gallon for gas because it's
[1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:31.560]  good for the earth no it's good for the globalist to take your discretionary
[1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:34.760]  income to make you poor so you're politically so busy you're not politically
[1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:39.760]  involved that's all been stated so many times by the globalist using making you
[1:17:39.760 --> 1:17:43.840]  poor as a tool of social control inner clowered and pivot and many other well
[1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:50.840]  known examples of this theorem spelled out and wrote writ large with the
[1:17:50.840 --> 1:18:00.800]  bona fides now that said backing away from this the big enchilada is bankrupting
[1:18:00.800 --> 1:18:05.120]  Russia so then the globalist can charge number amount they want OPEC have been
[1:18:05.120 --> 1:18:08.400]  criticizing Russia for selling oil at low prices you'd seen the drop the last
[1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:12.680]  few years mainly because of that from the all-time high they've also been
[1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:16.360]  pre-positioning the public that of oil prices ever went down the answer would
[1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:20.480]  be because of tax revenues supposedly going down no the taxes tagged on
[1:18:20.480 --> 1:18:23.360]  regardless that's another thing they play on your ignorance on the public's
[1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:31.120]  ignorance that they would start upping the taxes by the mile and taxes at the
[1:18:31.120 --> 1:18:37.360]  pump as a carbon tax so also oh your oil prices went down to a dollar you know
[1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:41.320]  there's lows of two dollars and in some areas the u.s. even lower now so they're
[1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:45.280]  going to keep dropping it for a while while they bankrupt Russia while they
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:49.480]  bankrupt the oil patch see Saudi Arabia had dual enemies Russia was drilling and
[1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:54.920]  developing and letting wildcatters in as well as state-run systems but wildcatters
[1:18:54.920 --> 1:19:01.240]  and other companies had basically drilled all over the u.s. and we're already
[1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:05.160]  bringing prices down so they're bringing them artificially low below market
[1:19:05.160 --> 1:19:09.320]  threshold to bankrupt them as well we said this month's ago it's now admitted
[1:19:09.320 --> 1:19:14.160]  all over the news stacks of articles are here in front of me we're gonna skip this
[1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:17.760]  network break this is so important I don't want to break thought here low
[1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:29.080]  oil prices pave the way for new carbon taxes that's out of CNBC news oh you see
[1:19:29.080 --> 1:19:32.360]  they didn't want to raise taxes because energy was already too expensive but now
[1:19:32.360 --> 1:19:37.320]  we can at the pump charge you a carbon tax oh but guess what now by global
[1:19:37.320 --> 1:19:43.680]  treaty and law worldwide all new cars but they're made in China South Korea the
[1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:50.360]  US Canada Mexico Japan it doesn't matter they all have a global standardized box
[1:19:50.360 --> 1:19:56.280]  the GPS you have to pay for in the cost of car you know it's not hooked up to
[1:19:56.280 --> 1:20:00.320]  your display it's there you're paying for it to tax you by the mile and more
[1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:04.280]  than 20 US cities are already doing the pilots which will then so you'll be taxed
[1:20:04.280 --> 1:20:08.720]  by the mile tracking everything you do and at the pump and basically at the
[1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:14.800]  wellhead as well when prominent members of both political parties talk about the
[1:20:14.800 --> 1:20:18.280]  possibility of taxing fossil fuels you know something serious has shifted in
[1:20:18.280 --> 1:20:22.360]  US policies yeah you got Republican leadership working with Obama on Monday
[1:20:22.360 --> 1:20:25.960]  morning former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers the guy that brought us
[1:20:25.960 --> 1:20:31.320]  derivatives a largely pro-business Democrat that's funny published a
[1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:35.640]  column in the Washington Post calling for the imposition of a carbon tax which
[1:20:35.640 --> 1:20:38.760]  they always say doesn't exist when you argue against it until you're living
[1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:42.040]  under it how like Obamacare didn't have death panels or didn't increase your
[1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:45.600]  prices or you can keep your doctor you didn't build your business or raising the
[1:20:45.600 --> 1:20:48.400]  debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit another such 2 plus 2 equals 10
[1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:56.480]  statements here's another one here's why gas increases make sense auto-nation
[1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:07.600]  WTI falls below 49 to new five and a half year low US crude oil fell to 49 last
[1:21:07.600 --> 1:21:11.920]  week we had articles on info wars.com warning you by our analysts that this
[1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:16.280]  was economic warfare against America as well folks it'll only help us for the
[1:21:16.280 --> 1:21:23.600]  short-term long-term it spells their plan to take us into a depression OPEC
[1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:32.120]  trying to punish US oil frackers wow I can't believe CNBC actually told the
[1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:37.480]  truth for once I remember two years ago we learned all these anti-fracking films
[1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:40.240]  and I'm not endorsing fracking either folks need to get this through their
[1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:43.680]  heads new listeners I don't just fall on one side of the other when it's a
[1:21:43.680 --> 1:21:49.200]  multifaceted issue some things are black and white but usually the point is
[1:21:49.200 --> 1:21:52.680]  fracking's got some problems and it's been abused in areas it gets over
[1:21:52.680 --> 1:21:56.000]  exaggerated how bad it is and when Matt Damon comes out against it with
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:59.120]  George Clooney and Obama comes out against it and then you find out the
[1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:05.880]  Saudis are buying up oil fracking companies just to shut them down and
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:09.280]  financing every one of these stinking films you know what's going on same
[1:22:09.280 --> 1:22:14.800]  thing shut Russia down it was the Saudis financed all this peak oil stuff
[1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:18.600]  they're finding so much oil it makes your head spin we've been getting raped
[1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:25.200]  for a decade as they raise oil prices but see now they've devalued the dollars
[1:22:25.200 --> 1:22:30.040]  so much oil prices should be high because the dollars been devalued the
[1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:33.800]  prices really aren't high it's just the dollars been devalued but now they
[1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:38.400]  devalued the dollar you've got to have somewhat oil high oil prices because
[1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:40.840]  it won't be enough to get out of the ground then you'll have a collapse of
[1:22:40.840 --> 1:22:45.240]  the market and then a huge spike later which is what the globalists are doing
[1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:49.440]  my family used to run a lot of cattle they still own some just for the tax
[1:22:49.440 --> 1:22:54.360]  break which we can't even hardly pay for our land our property taxes is not our
[1:22:54.360 --> 1:22:59.480]  land has this 1829 and it just gets smaller all the time as we can't pay
[1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:12.560]  the property taxes but riddle me this Batman how are oil prices connected to
[1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:22.400]  an example of beef well riddle me this if beef prices are at all time highs but
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:25.480]  farmers and ranchers are going on a business everywhere saying they can't
[1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:29.880]  make a living in it what's happening a fixed market where all all of the small
[1:23:29.880 --> 1:23:33.840]  meat packers essentially have been shut down there's a big four left that uses
[1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:40.520]  the illegal alien labor in his exempt basically and they are able to then
[1:23:40.520 --> 1:23:45.800]  control the market buy it at an extremely low price by cost collusion from
[1:23:45.800 --> 1:23:49.520]  the producer and then jack it up to whatever price they want delivering it
[1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:54.920]  to your table maximizing record profits not through free market but by rigging
[1:23:54.920 --> 1:24:01.000]  the system as the same thing with the oil companies and a associated press
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:06.680]  investigation you got a handed to him from 2001 found that in the secret
[1:24:06.680 --> 1:24:13.200]  meetings in 1995 and 1996 the big 12 oil companies met in New York and other
[1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:16.800]  cities more than a hundred times I'm going from memory on this you can look
[1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:22.400]  it up to work with the EPA and to fund environmental groups to shut down oil
[1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:26.280]  refineries they didn't own and to shut down some of the ones they already owned
[1:24:26.280 --> 1:24:32.000]  to ensure massive profits and a bottleneck at the refining level of
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:42.560]  Brent and sweet crude you understand now same thing with beef same thing with
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:47.880]  oil and that's why I saw the numbers last week for what oil is a barrel you
[1:24:47.880 --> 1:24:52.200]  should be paying about a dollar thirty five on average it varies on where you
[1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:56.480]  are for shipping but you're not you're paying over two dollars right now see
[1:24:56.480 --> 1:25:01.360]  so they're still gonna gang rape you even though they're gonna get the oil
[1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:06.200]  for cheaper now they're gonna sell it to you in the aggregate and basically get
[1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:10.880]  the same thing and then tell you oh our tax receipts have gone down because oil
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:14.440]  prices have gone down when it has nothing to do with that it's tacked on at
[1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:19.480]  the state and federal level regardless and if they needed more money they just
[1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:24.840]  raised the gas tax but if you search the term gas revenues gas tax revenues at
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:29.240]  record level you'll find that they're at record levels with the latest numbers
[1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:34.880]  we have in 2013 guys please search for TV viewers so they can test my memory
[1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:42.000]  gas tax revenue at record high you can see the 20-year graph there it just goes
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:48.560]  up and up and up only dropping in its acceleration parabolically still going
[1:25:48.560 --> 1:25:52.600]  up but dropping in the parabolic rate because prices were so high the last
[1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:58.240]  four or five years that consumption went down but still the receipts were
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:03.720]  higher so we're talking about real on the street economics right up to the OPEC
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:07.880]  cartel and by the way it's a cartel that fixes prices we don't need to have
[1:26:07.880 --> 1:26:11.320]  debates they admit they fix prices it's one of the most established facts out
[1:26:11.320 --> 1:26:15.400]  there but they came out last week and said OPEC does not fix prices that's
[1:26:15.400 --> 1:26:23.960]  right in Santa Claus isn't a big drunk elf in a red and white suit and Bill
[1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:33.000]  Clinton in the pervert so that's what it's all about carbon taxes you can see
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:38.080]  the full push bankrupt rush up bankrupt independent oil exploration in the
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:43.400]  United States shut down the coal industry jack-up prices there and just
[1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:46.400]  shut this country and the rest of the world down so the globalist can then
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:51.480]  loan us money they made up out of thin air to buy our lives to buy our sons to
[1:26:51.480 --> 1:26:56.440]  buy our daughters for nothing because big fat disgusting criminal crony
[1:26:56.440 --> 1:27:02.920]  capitalist like Larry Summers at Harvard can sit there and laugh at you and me
[1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:07.200]  because the public's ignorant just like Gruber said you're dumb you're ignorant
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:12.840]  and we're gonna rape you well you know what folks you put up with it you deserve
[1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:16.880]  it you like your kids future being flushed on the toilet by the way they
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:20.760]  know we're waking up to them they know there's a big call to remove Banner a
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:24.240]  speaker right now they know by every metric the number one problem in every
[1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:27.000]  major poll American says the corrupt government and corporate interest
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:30.920]  running it so what are they doing they're trying to stir up race war with
[1:27:30.920 --> 1:27:34.760]  the Democratic Party out there everywhere with I can't breathe protest
[1:27:34.760 --> 1:27:39.440]  going into restaurants harassing white people eating and harassing world war
[1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:46.800]  two vets at world war two events I mean this is just disgusting and again it's
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:50.560]  double-edged sword it gets a civil war started the distraction it makes the
[1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:53.840]  police feel sorry for themselves and see the public as the enemy and I'm gonna
[1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:58.160]  get into that stack of news today major new study out showing cops shoot white
[1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:03.040]  people fatally statistically per capita many more times in blacks because
[1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:07.360]  they're not worried about the political correct repercussions police now just
[1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:11.480]  don't respond in many predominantly black neighborhoods in Chicago and other
[1:28:11.480 --> 1:28:17.160]  areas because they're scared of being shot they've said this on record the
[1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:20.760]  New York cops said hey we're not standing down because we're throwing a fit
[1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:24.280]  they were in the news this weekend we're scared we're getting shot at all the
[1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:28.240]  time and nobody supports us so well you know what that's fine because cops job
[1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:33.320]  is to respond after a crimes been committed to investigate it and then to
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:39.040]  bring the people to us the jury you work for us cops work for cops because
[1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:42.760]  they're their citizens too you know those are your rights as well you bring
[1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:49.480]  them to us and we'll decide their fate but don't you dare is another part of
[1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:54.480]  that equation don't you dare police and most police don't impose so I say
[1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:59.400]  they're not the problem I've seen 98% and police national police association
[1:28:59.400 --> 1:29:05.800]  polls are for this right to keep their arms so the part of the equation is yeah
[1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:11.480]  cops you actually don't have to go around and put your life in danger until
[1:29:11.480 --> 1:29:14.840]  it's your job to go grab people that have committed crimes and to bring them
[1:29:14.840 --> 1:29:21.320]  to the system to the people but you cannot bar us having a right to defend
[1:29:21.320 --> 1:29:25.520]  ourselves and having our own guns police are supposed to be officers of the
[1:29:25.520 --> 1:29:30.440]  court and the people and at the county or city or state not an arm of the
[1:29:30.440 --> 1:29:33.480]  Democratic Party in the UN and the world government to go out and social
[1:29:33.480 --> 1:29:37.040]  engineer and arrest people for their kids doing chores or fireplaces or
[1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:40.760]  lemonade stands as a bunch of globalists minding us on the giant
[1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:44.520]  plantation or reservation you think Indians were allowed to do anything on

[1:33:12.680 --> 1:33:16.560]  GCN radio network
[1:33:21.320 --> 1:33:27.600]  I'm really wound up today because I had some time to cogitate this weekend
[1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:32.840]  and think about the state of the new world order and how real it is how
[1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:37.200]  scientific it is how planned it is and because the globalists have been so
[1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:40.920]  arrogant and have been building this thing in plain view that's their
[1:33:40.920 --> 1:33:45.800]  weakness and also their strength because something put out in plain view
[1:33:45.800 --> 1:33:51.080]  that's built slowly the sheephole tend to just kind of ignore as Ivy grows on
[1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:55.320]  parts of it it just becomes kind of a backdrop and we become comfortable with
[1:33:55.320 --> 1:34:02.360]  it we only get upset when the mainstream media tells us to get upset oh look an
[1:34:02.360 --> 1:34:06.360]  evil parent beat their kid and they died but meanwhile a hundred kids died from
[1:34:06.360 --> 1:34:12.240]  vaccines that week and it comes out in local news but nobody cares there's an
[1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:16.280]  agenda behind it they admit there's a brainwashing agenda against families
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:20.880]  against freedom against men against morality against sovereignty against
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:27.000]  savings there's an agenda by criminal sick weirdo so if I didn't make it clear
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:31.080]  let me make it clear now the oil prices being driven down are about bankrupting
[1:34:31.080 --> 1:34:35.800]  Russia's oil economy and bankrupting the US oil economy that's independent not
[1:34:35.800 --> 1:34:42.720]  controlled by OPEC and that's even in the Economist magazine and CNBC I didn't
[1:34:42.720 --> 1:34:46.520]  even need to read them and wait till they came out this weekend and admitted
[1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:55.040]  it I know how the global economy works I mean it's clear but it's also about
[1:34:55.040 --> 1:34:59.240]  lowering the price they could say hey let us raise taxes now that you can
[1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:04.640]  afford it it's for the earth now's the time when they lower the tax come like
[1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:10.440]  when the income tax came out it was less than 1% for most people it's not that
[1:35:10.440 --> 1:35:17.360]  today oh we lowered the gas prices which isn't an unofficial tax come like
[1:35:17.360 --> 1:35:23.760]  Obamacare is these cartels set up these corporate taxes to themselves and so now
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:29.160]  we see Boehner with all this political pressure on him to just repeal something
[1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:36.280]  out of Obamacare just the death panels just investigate Benghazi or fast
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:41.080]  and furious just don't let Obama shut down the power plants outside of law and
[1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:45.040]  the Republican leadership has come out and said we're not doing nothing on
[1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:50.120]  anything and when pressure mounts they'll follow the pattern they will then
[1:35:50.120 --> 1:35:59.920]  come out and do some lip service and have a committee hearing about it kind of
[1:35:59.920 --> 1:36:03.480]  like they did about oh we found out in Phoenix that there's secret death
[1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:08.720]  panels where they deny care to troops who have operable cancers and other
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:11.720]  problems and I said folks it's all over the country and it came out it was all
[1:36:11.720 --> 1:36:16.080]  over the country and then oh it's an accident oh and they turned it into an
[1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:23.320]  accident when it's an official secret death list you have got skin cancer you
[1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:30.120]  have got esophageal cancer you have got a heart problem you don't get the surgery
[1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:34.760]  no matter how big the bureaucracy is that was built for you we don't have the
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:39.560]  money but it turns out they did have the money they're just siphoning them all
[1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:43.360]  off to pay off the derivatives that aren't even ours we signed on to so
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:48.080]  people like Bill Gates who lives in 50,000 square feet houses can lecture
[1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:54.760]  you on carbon and how you shouldn't have kids even though he's got kids and how
[1:36:54.760 --> 1:36:56.840]  you shouldn't have a car but he's got a bunch of jet
[1:36:56.840 --> 1:37:06.760]  airplanes these are monsters now I want to get into the royal family in the
[1:37:06.760 --> 1:37:11.560]  pedophile garbage and we're going to go to your phone calls and I'm gonna get
[1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:18.560]  into television shows get ready for this you're gonna be watching television
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:24.080]  shows now and your new light bulbs mandated by the government in your house
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:28.880]  are gonna start when a machine gun fires they're gonna flash when a bomb goes
[1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:31.920]  off or or the lights go out in the movie the lights are gonna go out in your
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:36.720]  house and you don't worry you can go in the TV and turn it off of course they
[1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:43.160]  can always turn it on it's a house controlling kill switch a big giant
[1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:48.600]  square gray eye that's always watching as the center of your life you don't have
[1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:53.480]  real friends I don't have real friends we have our friends on ESPN we have our
[1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:59.080]  friends on Game of Thrones we have our friends we're playing video games in the
[1:37:59.080 --> 1:38:04.320]  Xboxes watching us connect through the walls through up to nine walls it's just
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:13.240]  freedom what kind of people would come up with something like this let me see
[1:38:13.240 --> 1:38:19.920]  here and again remember how long ago we told you with the patents with the
[1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:23.080]  documents how this was all coming and then the last six seven years that was
[1:38:23.080 --> 1:38:27.720]  already in place and then Janet Jackson's breasts popped out and the
[1:38:27.720 --> 1:38:33.000]  Chicago Tribune did something it wasn't supposed to do Tevo put out an
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:36.360]  announcement saying we had millions of rewinds and replays a record on our
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:40.720]  Tevo system during the replay did seconds after to see Janet Jackson's
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:45.120]  breasts pop out that's why you should have Tevo then a popular DVR still a
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:49.200]  popular DVR and the Chicago Tribune called him and said how do you know that
[1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:52.160]  they went oh it's two-way we track everything you watch and put it in an
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:58.440]  algorithm and see now there's cameras and audio and they're watching and
[1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:02.400]  listening and Samsung came out again I'm repeating that because you're not in
[1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:08.960]  Kansas anymore I'm not in Kansas anymore we should all be upset about this if
[1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:14.480]  giant alien spacecraft landed in every town and city and had big electrical
[1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:17.800]  tentacles that grew out and ran into every house and went to every light
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:24.240]  bulb every washing machine every device your iPhones your smart TVs your smart
[1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:28.600]  meter that's just the government's monitoring hub that is the tentacle
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:32.120]  the sick equivalent of spaceship landing putting a tentacle on your house
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:36.360]  and then it dials into everything that's what this is it's just not aliens
[1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:39.920]  it's globalists it's our own species doing this saying we're animals and
[1:39:39.920 --> 1:39:42.920]  they're this ascendant super being and they're about to merge with machines
[1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:49.200]  you're like oh that's crazy brother they're doing it I don't know what the
[1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:53.280]  end thing will be but they so far they're they're falling a plan and it's
[1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:59.640]  working so imagine spaceships land see this shocks you because you're designed
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:03.680]  when an outsider attacks to have battle readiness and be threatened so image
[1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:10.400]  giant spaceships landing their doors open and tentacles all come out or pods
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:13.640]  all come out let's say it's wireless but tentacles are scarier because we're
[1:40:13.640 --> 1:40:16.960]  designed you know for tentacles and teeth and things attacking us so let's go
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:23.280]  with that an allegory all streaming out hooking into your house looking
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:27.320]  everything at your Google glasses and now taking control of them and watching
[1:40:27.320 --> 1:40:34.280]  everything you're doing to study you for the next wave that's coming in at a
[1:40:34.280 --> 1:40:41.680]  hundred light years an hour space warping in a thousand attack ships they
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:45.240]  already sent their probes and got them down on the surface hooked into everything
[1:40:45.240 --> 1:40:49.880]  watching everything we're doing they got control of government their poison the
[1:40:49.880 --> 1:40:53.400]  water the food taking over the churches the institutions they've already got
[1:40:53.400 --> 1:40:59.920]  their advanced operatives in cloned body suits their biomechanical aliens in the
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:05.240]  positions of power everywhere now and they're surveilling trying to buy off
[1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:13.800]  whoever they can using psych warfare and cultural systems and then warping in
[1:41:13.800 --> 1:41:21.040]  five ten years away we don't have exact analysis on when they're gonna land is
[1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:25.160]  the main attack fleet with all the intel on us ready to shut everything we've
[1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:29.840]  got off and totally control us when they get here the aliens will control
[1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:35.240]  Skynet they already control it when their main force gets here with the
[1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:40.840]  ground troops and the ground troops folks are gonna be robots now you remove
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:46.040]  aliens from a thousand light years away ten thousand light years away what you
[1:41:46.040 --> 1:41:51.880]  just heard is the plan now folks you try relaxing when you know that
[1:41:51.880 --> 1:41:56.440]  information and you're sure about it and the globalists have all written
[1:41:56.440 --> 1:42:00.840]  books basically describing it they don't put the cherry on top and they say
[1:42:00.840 --> 1:42:03.800]  they're gonna kill everybody they're gonna get rid of us the machines will
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:07.320]  replace us will be obsolete they're gonna live forever but they don't say oh
[1:42:07.320 --> 1:42:10.480]  by the way this total grids gonna enslave you I mean actually do say that
[1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:19.280]  but in pieces now would you fight if you knew aliens had done this I don't know
[1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:22.400]  a lot of men would just say my kids are dead anyways I'm gonna watch Sports
[1:42:22.400 --> 1:42:26.480]  Center when do you say those aliens are gonna kill us and I'm like well they
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:29.560]  already put stuff in your food and water actuary it out to kill you right after
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:33.160]  the time you're done working but that was an old actuary not to pay you out
[1:42:33.160 --> 1:42:36.880]  just like the vets they don't give health care to another 25 years old they
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:42.680]  make private charities do that now it's actually worried out that you won't be
[1:42:42.680 --> 1:42:46.520]  needed within about 10 years as soon as the robots replace you but the robots
[1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:50.200]  are only a cleanup crew to get rid of this civilization that's seen as wasteful
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:55.400]  and destructive the decision has been made to overwrite humanity and the
[1:42:55.400 --> 1:43:00.040]  average man will just look at you and say hey Sports Center babe they pull out

[1:43:15.200 --> 1:43:20.000]  called psychopaths they're called a criminally insane psychopaths there's a
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:22.720]  lot of psychopaths out there that are really just sociopaths they don't like
[1:43:22.720 --> 1:43:27.000]  tying kids down and torturing them for a month using them up as they call it but
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:32.240]  but there is a minority of psychopaths that enjoy hurting innocents and the
[1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:37.800]  worst of them like hurting women and children and that's their taste and you
[1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:43.640]  don't get into the club unless you like hurting small children and we all know
[1:43:43.640 --> 1:43:47.720]  that throughout history don't get near the castle at night monsters will grab
[1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:53.400]  you they would every culture said don't get near the castle at night monsters

[1:44:01.800 --> 1:44:05.680]  dusk and knock them on the head and take them back like a cat plays with a
[1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:07.880]  mouse
[1:44:07.880 --> 1:44:13.880]  now transfer that to the future where our ancestors developed the technologies
[1:44:13.880 --> 1:44:17.320]  the computers the systems that we believe were defending us from the
[1:44:17.320 --> 1:44:23.840]  Russians and things now to be used against us are we smart enough do we
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:27.400]  have the will to break out of the trance and do something about the master
[1:44:27.400 --> 1:44:34.080]  plan then I'm going to David Regina Richard Rachel Amy and others now let

[1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:10.880]  revealed how Clinton took multiple trips to Epstein's private island where he
[1:45:10.880 --> 1:45:14.600]  kept young women as sex slaves Clinton was also apparently friends with a
[1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:17.920]  woman who collected naked pictures of underage girls for Epstein to choose
[1:45:17.920 --> 1:45:22.480]  from he hasn't cut ties with the woman however and invited her to Chelsea's
[1:45:22.480 --> 1:45:30.280]  wedding comes as friends now fear that Hillary Clinton runs in 2016 all of
[1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:34.120]  their family's old scandals will be brought to the forefront you think
[1:45:34.120 --> 1:45:38.600]  George Clooney and Matt Damon care Epstein has also a host of famous
[1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:43.120]  friends including Prince Andrew who stated his New York mansion after his
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:48.360]  arrest and that's now in the lawsuit Prince Andrew may have been secretly
[1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:52.120]  filmed underage girls he is alleged to have abused they've now declared
[1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:57.360]  national security and say it's inadmissible in England billionaire
[1:45:57.360 --> 1:46:03.400]  sex offender phone book contain email addresses 12 21 phone numbers for Bill
[1:46:03.400 --> 1:46:09.800]  Clinton this is in today's news as well January 6th this is just today's news
[1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:16.560]  former HHS official sent us 25 years in prison for child pornography oh look
[1:46:16.560 --> 1:46:22.760]  Seattle Post intelligence sir police Bill Gates estate staff member traded
[1:46:22.760 --> 1:46:27.960]  child porn by Gmail oh look at Bill Gates is one of his giant this house is
[1:46:27.960 --> 1:46:31.880]  smaller and this was only 40,000 square feet but that's got a carbon
[1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:34.480]  footprint
[1:46:34.840 --> 1:46:39.680]  former HHS official though it's a sense 25 years so that's just some of the news
[1:46:39.680 --> 1:46:46.640]  meanwhile the royal family the royalty royal family defends Prince Andrew amid
[1:46:46.640 --> 1:46:51.600]  sex abuse allegations British royal family and fatally defends Prince
[1:46:51.600 --> 1:47:00.520]  against the sex claims that's out of ABC News 11 Andrew's a great man the best
[1:47:00.520 --> 1:47:04.320]  in the world Fergie says marrying the Duke was the finest moment in her life
[1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:11.040]  but she doesn't mention abuser helped pay off her debts that's right she was
[1:47:11.040 --> 1:47:16.040]  getting a little cash from the Prince's friend so I'm not gonna go to the rest
[1:47:16.040 --> 1:47:20.360]  of these it's just that's what's going on that's what's happening that's what's
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:25.000]  unfolding and I'm a libertarian you know if these rich guys want to have 15
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:29.240]  mistresses or the head of Google Schmidt you know is into like 35 year old
[1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:34.040]  women that sounds you know alpha male healthy I'm not saying it's a good thing
[1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:37.680]  overall but if that's what he wants to do that that's his issue when you start
[1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:42.920]  targeting children you need to be put in a dark self the rest of your life and if
[1:47:42.920 --> 1:47:49.320]  you get caught hurting the children you need to be executed the problem is the
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:54.560]  system is basically pretty much run by these people but occasionally folks in
[1:47:54.560 --> 1:47:57.840]  the system are able to try to stop them and there are a lot of good people in
[1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:01.560]  the system who aren't aware of how bad it is but are becoming aware of it and
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:07.160]  that threatens the power structure because as info wars the decompartmentalizes
[1:48:07.160 --> 1:48:11.080]  the world I don't just mean my info war but the info war you the people out
[1:48:11.080 --> 1:48:16.440]  ferreting researching double-checking Adon Salazar over the weekend that we

[1:48:21.160 --> 1:48:25.320]  this article out of mainstream Pakistani newspapers showing street protest
[1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:32.120]  against children killed by terrorists and it's photos of people that are
[1:48:32.120 --> 1:48:37.080]  believed to be actors from Sandy Hook that have been identified and even in
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:39.400]  the Aurora shooting I didn't believe it when this first happened three four
[1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:43.000]  years ago I went looked it up it turned out the people there really were actors
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:47.480]  the witnesses they had on TV and later bragged about it I mean I'm living in
[1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:50.200]  the twilight zone I don't know how deep this goes because I can't handle it
[1:48:50.200 --> 1:48:55.280]  anymore okay I mean I just you figure it out mystery Sandy Hook victim dies
[1:48:55.280 --> 1:49:00.680]  again in Pakistan and I went to the newspaper it's real photos from the big

[1:49:05.240 --> 1:49:11.360]  this is getting crazy I mean who knows if the terrorists even killed people I
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:16.880]  mean I mean this is just entering into because the system has just decided to
[1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:20.600]  lie to everybody they've legalized the CIA engaging this it happened last year
[1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:27.880]  lying to the American people that was legalized last year I'm gonna go to

[1:56:15.200 --> 1:56:19.280]  go ahead and go to David get the calls kicked off will accelerate through them
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:24.440]  in the next hour in Iowa how are you doing today I'm doing good sir how about
[1:56:24.440 --> 1:56:28.120]  your stuff I'm all right kind of wound up a few days not a few days off but a
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:32.080]  few days off the mic yeah I can see that you're finally able to have the show
[1:56:32.080 --> 1:56:35.560]  that you wanted to have for 20 years you can finally tell everybody because now
[1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:40.720]  we've caught up all the technology we're talking about before now it's actually
[1:56:40.720 --> 1:56:44.360]  mainstream and people actually believe you know because the police state is out
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:48.160]  there what I wanted to talk about was basically how those light bulbs those
[1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:51.760]  TVs interacting with each other they're just getting us prepared to jack into
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:58.200]  the matrix people in 2015 we're either gonna be free and independent or it's
[1:56:58.200 --> 1:57:02.480]  gonna be collective slavery David Knight yesterday we're talking about how
[1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:06.360]  during one of the NFL games a guy put out a tweet about how he was gonna rush
[1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:10.120]  the field and then they caught him with the security because of the police state
[1:57:10.120 --> 1:57:14.320]  and I think this is crazy because that tweet got retweeted over and over and
[1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:17.760]  over and over again and then he was the only one that got caught and nobody else
[1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:22.120]  bum-rushed the field and 2015 we're gonna have to bum-rush the field because
[1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:27.360]  we're all gonna have to become our own leaders now destiny is decision
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:31.920]  decision is destiny if we make the decision that we create our own
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:37.240]  realities that we tap into who we are spiritually we there's nothing that we
[1:57:37.240 --> 1:57:42.040]  can't do blacks Hispanics trendies they're the new proletariat that they're
[1:57:42.040 --> 1:57:46.280]  using with the cloud and piven like you guys have been saying for so many years
[1:57:46.280 --> 1:57:51.520]  to try to over overthrow everything and topple the system that's being created
[1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:55.440]  but who's the matrix for who's the technology gonna be for who's the who
[1:57:55.440 --> 1:58:00.040]  are who are the mega cities like a Jakarta in Mumbai in the in the
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:03.280]  computer-driven cars who's that gonna be for that's gonna be for the people
[1:58:03.280 --> 1:58:06.920]  left over who are moving into those cities not the people who are gonna be
[1:58:06.920 --> 1:58:10.280]  creating the people's revolution like they that's right the elites are moving
[1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:14.200]  in the middle of deserts with no one around for thousands of miles on purpose

[2:01:28.160 --> 2:01:33.040]  just wanted to say that the city of Milwaukee Wisconsin out to the small
[2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:38.120]  town of South Dakota and just being able to see the difference in people the
[2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:42.080]  difference and everything that's going on it's just unbelievable and we left
[2:01:42.080 --> 2:01:45.160]  the heavy police state behind and then we come out here where you know the
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:49.000]  police would on the local shooting range down the block and send incendiary
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:55.760]  rounds down into the targets it's weird but you know I was a emergency and
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:01:59.160]  critical care vet tech in Milwaukee out here I work at this local grocery store
[2:01:59.160 --> 2:02:03.640]  so I get to talk to all these people it the floor right in the water out here it's
[2:02:03.640 --> 2:02:07.120]  so high it's like 3.2 parts per million I mean you see a lot of zombies it's
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:13.000]  pretty ridiculous a lot of cancer a lot of ridiculous stuff but it's so awesome
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:17.600]  to see people awake and alive despite all of that stuff I mean freedom is
[2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:22.280]  contagious and to see the way that we as human beings overpower all of this stuff
[2:02:22.280 --> 2:02:27.160]  that's against us it's just amazing we have this little tiny newspaper in town
[2:02:27.160 --> 2:02:31.240]  and somebody's been putting info wars a little info wars notice in the little
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:35.040]  tiny newspaper out here it's like I mean we're getting out people are poison
[2:02:35.040 --> 2:02:39.280]  people are pushed down people are you know I mean we are really screwed but
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:43.840]  at the same time we have this vitality this life force that's just I mean it's
[2:02:43.840 --> 2:02:47.840]  still showing through it's an epic battle the globalists have to harness that
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:52.080]  life force or they don't get to make all the decisions our free will gets in the
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:56.080]  way of them being able to control the destiny of this planet and so it is a
[2:02:56.080 --> 2:02:59.640]  struggle over the destiny of the planet and they've just convinced people to be
[2:02:59.640 --> 2:03:04.600]  cynical silly ah humans are crap show what yeah they're gonna kill all of us
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:10.000]  nobody can stop it to just have that self-fulfilling prophecy to believe that
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:13.760]  and then they take over the problem is the globalist of the very worst of us
[2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:17.960]  the very last people we want in charge so yes what you're saying really rings
[2:03:17.960 --> 2:03:24.320]  through we are living in an epic epic time it is I mean we are in 2015 right
[2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:27.760]  now we live in the future it's so unbelievable but I mean the powers that
[2:03:27.760 --> 2:03:31.240]  we have it I mean everybody gets depressed about this stuff I mean
[2:03:31.240 --> 2:03:34.720]  some days I'm so mad I just want to ring everybody's neck and be like what is wrong
[2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:39.320]  with you how can you vaccinate your kids how can you drink this water how can you
[2:03:39.320 --> 2:03:42.120]  do this and you put somebody in the right direction and that's all that you
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:45.640]  can do is point them in the right direction and hope that they look but
[2:03:45.640 --> 2:03:49.840]  but like I said despite all that stuff I mean to still see people coming through
[2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:56.360]  people popping out of the woodwork in talking truth and you know good energy
[2:03:56.360 --> 2:03:59.840]  it's just such a it's such a blessing and it really helps me get through the
[2:03:59.840 --> 2:04:04.320]  tough times I'm telling you I mean we we are doing everything we can here and
[2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:07.960]  we were trying to be the change you know and we don't have any food in our
[2:04:07.960 --> 2:04:11.320]  cupboard we're sitting here you know waiting for someone to come to our gas
[2:04:11.320 --> 2:04:15.320]  we can't have heat in the house and we're happy we're doing what we can do
[2:04:15.320 --> 2:04:20.720]  and that's all you can do you know well I agree with you and speaking of
[2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:27.160]  depressing John Boehner was just elected to a third term as Speaker of the House
[2:04:27.160 --> 2:04:33.640]  but in a way his attempt to block the libertarian revolution to stop Obama's
[2:04:33.640 --> 2:04:37.360]  takeover his aiding and abetting I think will only destroy the Republican
[2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:43.080]  establishment more and really give us a chance at further galvanizing the
[2:04:43.080 --> 2:04:46.520]  Republican Party to take the country back because if Boehner was actually
[2:04:46.520 --> 2:04:50.960]  fighting Obama some folks would go back to sleep now people understand how dire
[2:04:50.960 --> 2:04:56.280]  our straits are so it's the best of times worst of times scenario boner has

[2:11:35.720 --> 2:11:43.080]  it's so fun your TV's watching you you are an amazing media figure thank you
[2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:49.540]  very much for what you do my father worked for the Associated Press you can

[2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:58.520]  problem putting my name out there because my father was a legacy within
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:03.920]  the Associated Press just fact ma'am nothing but the fact afterwards he
[2:12:03.920 --> 2:12:09.360]  retired from the press and he actually sold radio stations and television
[2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:15.320]  space for a living so I heard that name but go ahead I grew up in the business
[2:12:15.320 --> 2:12:20.320]  and I watched these big wigs like Kent Turner and I've seen what they do and I
[2:12:20.320 --> 2:12:23.800]  seen how they act I was around them when I was a very little girl I grew up I
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:27.560]  went to all their national radio broadcasting conventions throughout the
[2:12:27.560 --> 2:12:31.480]  southeast in the summertime when we weren't in school I grew up in this
[2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:36.040]  stuff I've seen it with my own eyes I tried to teach people for years what's
[2:12:36.040 --> 2:12:41.440]  going on then I had a kid on piece 11 now I dropped out of the scene for a while
[2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:46.960]  I have mooned Apache helicopters on private property that we're filming what
[2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:51.640]  we were doing staging protests in Atlanta wow I know exactly what's going on in
[2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:55.320]  this world and it's very scary that called to tell you thank you very much
[2:12:55.320 --> 2:12:58.240]  for being please don't thank me ma'am I want to thank you we're all in this
[2:12:58.240 --> 2:13:01.400]  together but it sounds like you've been taking action for a long time what's
[2:13:01.400 --> 2:13:05.520]  your view on all the news we've been covering today and tell us any tell us
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:14.760]  some Ted Turner stories Ted Turner stories okay Ted Turner's a drunk he used
[2:13:14.760 --> 2:13:18.520]  to come through the cocktail or through the cocktail parties back in the day when
[2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:23.600]  he only owned TBS and he would come through like a used car salesman and be
[2:13:23.600 --> 2:13:28.520]  like hi my name is Ted Turner I own TBS in Atlanta he was very you know Ted
[2:13:28.520 --> 2:13:32.880]  Turner's and he's he's what you see he's put himself out there in the media
[2:13:32.880 --> 2:13:37.720]  everybody knows what he is he's got his polo ties and his cowboy boots and I was
[2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:41.640]  about to say as bad as Ted Turner is at least he's honest he's like there's so
[2:13:41.640 --> 2:13:45.120]  many people we need to kill most of them I'm from world government I have five
[2:13:45.120 --> 2:13:49.320]  kids you have none I have jet airplanes you live in a shack I'm Ted Turner yeah
[2:13:49.320 --> 2:13:54.000]  he's he's a piece of work and he did win the world yacht champion race that's
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:57.720]  pretty hard to do but go ahead he started off as a poor farm boy he had
[2:13:57.720 --> 2:14:02.520]  nothing and his father told him you will always be a dirt farmer you know that's
[2:14:02.520 --> 2:14:07.120]  that's it he said no dad I'm not he started his you know company and he
[2:14:07.120 --> 2:14:12.200]  built a great company but the only reason that man put satellites all over the
[2:14:12.200 --> 2:14:17.760]  world was because several people in the news business came to him and said hey
[2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:21.560]  look I'm not going to mention names of the air if you'd like to talk about this
[2:14:21.560 --> 2:14:25.280]  privately great but I know some of the stories about how Turner watched CNN in
[2:14:25.280 --> 2:14:29.200]  1980 I'll let it go ahead I could discuss some things with you but over the
[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:34.960]  air needed kind of be sure but you know he was he was told if you take your whole
[2:14:34.960 --> 2:14:38.840]  station it was worth a hundred million dollars you put these satellites up
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:44.440]  everywhere we can have news 24 hours a day people like watching the news dad they
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:49.280]  need news 24 hours a day it was started off as a good thing it wasn't meant to
[2:14:49.280 --> 2:14:54.480]  become what it is now Trisha very very sad well I knew that from some insiders
[2:14:54.480 --> 2:14:57.480]  too it did start out this is a news platform that's why it was popular but
[2:14:57.480 --> 2:15:01.960]  as soon as it got big the CIA came in and just ran the whole show what else did
[2:15:01.960 --> 2:15:07.120]  you call in about today Regina well I do totally agree with you about everything
[2:15:07.120 --> 2:15:10.760]  that you're saying about these TVs are watching you I've been trying to tell
[2:15:10.760 --> 2:15:15.280]  people that for years people listen to Alex Jones he speaks the truth he's not
[2:15:15.280 --> 2:15:20.560]  a mongrel he's not making this stuff up he backs up every bit of information
[2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:25.600]  with documents I've researched his research before I ever even called the
[2:15:25.600 --> 2:15:30.280]  show been listening for months listen to Alex so we get a little bit you know I
[2:15:30.280 --> 2:15:35.080]  don't know what you do you get excited when I call it and it's because he's
[2:15:35.080 --> 2:15:40.200]  upset and you should be upset and you should push it and open your eyes don't
[2:15:40.200 --> 2:15:46.160]  be asleep people wake up that's all I got to say sir well God bless you and I
[2:15:46.160 --> 2:15:52.920]  appreciate your call I mean for me it's the bizarre experience of having a
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:16:01.160]  time-warner engineer contact me 18 years ago and it turned out he was a senior
[2:16:01.160 --> 2:16:05.040]  engineer who wasn't even living here at the time he was coming through he saw
[2:16:05.040 --> 2:16:12.080]  my access show and he talked to me I met with him and he said no these
[2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:15.960]  microphones are listening with keyword you know about the NSA you know about
[2:16:15.960 --> 2:16:20.880]  word logging oh yeah and he goes that's what's happening and he said I'm really
[2:16:20.880 --> 2:16:25.860]  upset about this and he was a guy I don't want to give out too much info but
[2:16:25.860 --> 2:16:30.880]  who you know owned a stake in some of the technology I'll just leave it at that
[2:16:30.880 --> 2:16:36.400]  then I got contacted by one of their local engineers he said no it's true I'll
[2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:40.360]  come dismantle one of these for you came to my house opened up the box showed
[2:16:40.360 --> 2:16:45.040]  me what to cover showed me the blueprints I went on air and talked about it
[2:16:45.040 --> 2:16:57.440]  imagine 18 years ago going on air on the cable system on access television and
[2:16:57.440 --> 2:17:02.240]  this happened Mike Hansen was there we've got tapes of it oh we got a we've
[2:17:02.240 --> 2:17:05.080]  got just one warehouse not a warehouse like 20 boxes of them we got to go
[2:17:05.080 --> 2:17:12.600]  through them before they all disintegrate and imagine we start
[2:17:12.600 --> 2:17:20.200]  dismantling the box on TV and the feed cuts out which it never did and they
[2:17:20.200 --> 2:17:24.280]  called it an FM translator that took sounds like FM radio but it's not that
[2:17:24.280 --> 2:17:29.120]  it took the video and digitized it and Time Warner then every time I would try
[2:17:29.120 --> 2:17:32.920]  to cover it would turn it off what I would talk about this scientific
[2:17:32.920 --> 2:17:37.400]  Atlantic cable box that you everyone has watching the show this new son of
[2:17:37.400 --> 2:17:41.120]  Atlantic digital cable box you're getting has a microphone in it here it
[2:17:41.120 --> 2:17:46.960]  is here's the microphone and I get the death threats because again back then
[2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:50.760]  people could have woken up and said no because that's 1984 now they're so
[2:17:50.760 --> 2:17:56.640]  conditioned they're like here's an example five years ago one of our riders
[2:17:56.640 --> 2:18:00.080]  wrote an article about patents and how companies were about to come out the
[2:18:00.080 --> 2:18:05.040]  next year with microchips in the pills so they could track and make sure you and
[2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:10.200]  you alone were taking them and where the pills were the size of a grain of sand
[2:18:10.200 --> 2:18:18.240]  is how big the RFID transmitter is receiver transmitter it can be read we
[2:18:18.240 --> 2:18:22.720]  put up that article linking to the patent and the company announcement and I
[2:18:22.720 --> 2:18:27.320]  had the vice president of that huge company call me and threaten to sue me
[2:18:27.320 --> 2:18:31.840]  and he said he goes listen I got on the phone with them this concept I have to
[2:18:31.840 --> 2:18:35.600]  do around here he goes listen I don't care if you're gonna beat us in court
[2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:38.360]  buddy you ready to defend a multi-million dollar lawsuit take the
[2:18:38.360 --> 2:18:46.040]  article down and I said no I'm not told him F you I'm gonna be honest with
[2:18:46.040 --> 2:18:49.680]  people it's not Christian it's not good I said F you hung it up me they didn't
[2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:53.480]  do it but that's the kind of stuff I you think they just let us put this stuff
[2:18:53.480 --> 2:18:59.240]  out during our flu coverage during the swine flu I had major companies calling
[2:18:59.240 --> 2:19:02.800]  me up going we can cause you a lot of big trouble or we can become big friends
[2:19:02.800 --> 2:19:06.640]  I go what do you mean well you're in the radio business you got advertisers

[2:25:19.680 --> 2:25:24.480]  bigger grass pull somebody out put them in the spotlight let the world know what
[2:25:24.480 --> 2:25:28.440]  they're doing and then all the rats could run for the for the for the shadows

[2:25:56.200 --> 2:26:00.360]  Boehner almost lost today I think more and more people are waking up and what
[2:26:00.360 --> 2:26:04.040]  I want to ask you Alex is you think that's a good strategy do you think we
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:08.520]  should get people more involved at the local level and just start tearing into
[2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:12.560]  these crony politicians and start taking taking our country back either through
[2:26:12.560 --> 2:26:17.000]  the Republican Party or the Democrat Party wherever Liberty is gonna resonate
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:21.280]  best from do you think it makes sense for us to be engaged in the political
[2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:25.080]  I totally agree I mean look we couldn't get one co-sponsored or audit the
[2:26:25.080 --> 2:26:28.400]  Federal Reserve it's passed the House twice now and they predict in the new
[2:26:28.400 --> 2:26:31.920]  Senate it may actually pass to audit the private Federal Reserve that will lead
[2:26:31.920 --> 2:26:37.280]  to exposure and to its repeal if we keep pushing the future is dictated by what
[2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:42.520]  we do it's not just evil on their side Boehner just got reelected but narrowly
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:46.520]  is the third term a speaker now everyone needs to start trying to push for a
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:52.880]  recall election with the signatures at the state level and put heat on him
[2:26:52.880 --> 2:26:57.320]  for getting money as it's come out in the news today from Obama from the
[2:26:57.320 --> 2:27:01.920]  insurance companies for having his investments with those companies set to
[2:27:01.920 --> 2:27:05.400]  make millions off the American people's back the fact that he's exempt from
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:10.440]  Obamacare he's a bigger enemy now than Obama you bring him down you bring down
[2:27:10.440 --> 2:27:14.200]  the Republican blue bloods who are always there as a globalist rearguard
[2:27:14.200 --> 2:27:18.120]  action to stop any conservative movement taking this country back and my
[2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:21.840]  conservative I mean conserving the Bill of Rights and Constitution the Second
[2:27:21.840 --> 2:27:26.800]  Amendment family you name it so great points last chance good to hear from you
[2:27:26.800 --> 2:27:31.240]  here's the great part about the fact that seven percent of the American people
[2:27:31.240 --> 2:27:34.440]  agree with Congress in Gallup polls and others they think the government's the
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:40.280]  number one problem that shows people are awake what they're not awake to is
[2:27:40.280 --> 2:27:45.960]  their power you don't have to save the world last chance we have to save it
[2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:50.120]  with God's providence that's how history works I've experienced it when
[2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:54.440]  there's overwhelming odds if you're conscious of it you got up and you say
[2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:59.400]  even though I don't want to do this and I'm scared at a certain level I'm doing
[2:27:59.400 --> 2:28:02.200]  the right thing for the innocence out there I got to stand up for the children
[2:28:02.200 --> 2:28:06.640]  and then boom you step across threshold there's no more fear the danger is you
[2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:11.080]  do that so many times yet we're never afraid anymore and that's its own danger
[2:28:11.080 --> 2:28:17.080]  so I've prayed for discernment and I've prayed for God to you know direct me and
[2:28:17.080 --> 2:28:23.320]  then I do have fear when I need it and it's over the top I mean I have been
[2:28:23.320 --> 2:28:27.600]  given some fear back and I know in some passages says be fearless other places
[2:28:27.600 --> 2:28:34.680]  the Bible says you know be wise and and what I mean is wise but it's for some of
[2:28:34.680 --> 2:28:40.200]  us to charge out there 110% it's for some of us to quietly work on things a
[2:28:40.200 --> 2:28:44.560]  blog a magazine telling friends handing out business cards calling the talk
[2:28:44.560 --> 2:28:49.400]  radio having a radio show doing an access show having a YouTube channel just
[2:28:49.400 --> 2:28:54.000]  getting involved or reaching out running for city council running for state rep
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:58.320]  running for dog catcher they don't run for dog catcher but you know the point
[2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:05.400]  to from the highest position the lowest get involved when you see police
[2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:09.240]  officers who are the lowest level of enforcement where the rubber meets the
[2:29:09.240 --> 2:29:12.040]  robe we're gonna break them back with calls and get to that news I mentioned
[2:29:12.040 --> 2:29:17.120]  11 predictions on economic disaster in 2015 from top experts and then the
[2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:22.680]  chemtrail article that I didn't get to last week you see police officers go
[2:29:22.680 --> 2:29:25.960]  over and thank them for putting their life in danger just like you think
[2:29:25.960 --> 2:29:30.480]  firefighters or anybody else or paramedics and then say I know a lot of
[2:29:30.480 --> 2:29:34.600]  you got into this for the right reasons but know this the system is taking over
[2:29:34.600 --> 2:29:38.360]  local police and does have a corrupt mission for you so you follow the

[2:32:10.560 --> 2:32:14.400]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans

[2:32:30.200 --> 2:32:33.880]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[2:32:33.880 --> 2:32:38.280]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we

[2:33:14.880 --> 2:33:19.520]  commonwealths in Dallas Texas three shots were fired at president Kennedy's
[2:33:19.520 --> 2:33:24.600]  motorcade in downtown Dallas the first reports say that president Kennedy has
[2:33:24.600 --> 2:33:33.560]  been seriously wounded by the shooting it is a big idea a new world order
[2:33:33.560 --> 2:33:43.120]  it was almost as if it were planned in force just hanging either you were with
[2:33:43.120 --> 2:33:47.920]  us or you were with the terrorists
[2:33:47.920 --> 2:34:04.920]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals
[2:34:08.920 --> 2:34:12.920]  the guns will be taken no one will be able to be off we can take all the guns
[2:34:12.920 --> 2:34:17.680]  for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city

[2:34:22.160 --> 2:34:26.120]  aren't we all just living and dying from what the central banks do
[2:34:31.520 --> 2:34:38.880]  live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones well I give myself a B plus
[2:34:38.880 --> 2:34:42.160]  today and usually I give myself about a C minus covering a volume of news but I
[2:34:42.160 --> 2:34:45.200]  really want to hit a lot of stuff I haven't gotten to yet at least briefly
[2:34:45.200 --> 2:34:49.520]  and finish up with some phone calls in the 26 minutes we have left in this
[2:34:49.520 --> 2:34:52.480]  worldwide transmission
[2:34:55.600 --> 2:34:59.120]  but I didn't mention a few of the new affiliates we've gotten the last month or
[2:34:59.120 --> 2:35:07.080]  so so let me finish that list KZ LS 1640 a.m. in Oklahoma that is Oklahoma City
[2:35:07.080 --> 2:35:13.400]  the Eagle big station there all these stations are fabulous KSMD 99.1 FM
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:22.000]  Pangburn Arkansas News Talk 99.1 WMEX 1510 a.m. Boston where Liberty has a
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:28.560]  voice huge audience huge station tell everybody in Boston 1510 Alex Jones
[2:35:28.560 --> 2:35:36.000]  explaining what the nanny states really all about so incredibly important we've
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:41.200]  gotten about 15 new affiliates the last month I know that brings us up to close
[2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:46.560]  to well it's over 180 affiliates but there's always stations selling or
[2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:52.600]  changing format so as you gain you lose but overall we are gaining and it's a
[2:35:52.600 --> 2:35:57.200]  big deal it's a very competitive market we're not with clear channel or with
[2:35:57.200 --> 2:36:03.720]  cumulus talk radio networks basically gone the way of the Gooney bird you got
[2:36:03.720 --> 2:36:08.800]  some smaller networks out there like Salem that are quite large but they
[2:36:08.800 --> 2:36:14.880]  remember my criticism of Bush so that's I'm persona non grata but I'm not
[2:36:14.880 --> 2:36:17.280]  criticizing anybody that violates the Bill of Rights the Constitution I'm not
[2:36:17.280 --> 2:36:21.800]  a partisan I just cover issues and facts and I want freedom for myself and my
[2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:25.680]  family that means you better live in a free country or I don't either it's
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:31.000]  self-preservation it's insane to want to live under tyranny it's insane when
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:34.560]  Microsoft and Samsung come out in the last few months and say yeah we're
[2:36:34.560 --> 2:36:40.600]  watching and listening to you so when you turn this on this TV or this Xbox

[2:38:19.720 --> 2:38:27.720]  friend the janitor of the plumber oh my goodness oh okay I'm gonna go to your
[2:38:27.720 --> 2:38:34.080]  calls we just do this now I've been intended to do this earlier I don't do
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:37.320]  this every day on air in fact I've done in a few weeks but I actually do this
[2:38:37.320 --> 2:38:41.240]  during the breaks and I get so busy I forget to do it
[2:38:45.480 --> 2:38:51.120]  I'm gonna take my super mill vitality my secret 12 and my fluoride shield and
[2:38:51.120 --> 2:39:00.760]  I'm gonna put a couple squirts of each in the water proprietary vitamin B12
[2:39:00.760 --> 2:39:05.960]  extremely absorbable methylcobalamin that's the pharmaceutical grade folks and
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:10.720]  I'm gonna take some fluoride shield I'm gonna mix it all together that's a
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:18.440]  chelating detoxer and I decided to just do oxy powder all month long recommended
[2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:20.960]  you only do it like for a week long stance I'm doing it all month long to see
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:26.520]  what happens it's been dramatic my energy is off the charts and I'm eating
[2:39:26.520 --> 2:39:33.200]  the exact same amount and I've not worked out in six days which is something I
[2:39:33.200 --> 2:39:37.960]  haven't done in about a year and because my gut prediction is if I actually take
[2:39:37.960 --> 2:39:42.040]  these products three times a day at the recommended dose and I take the oxy
[2:39:42.040 --> 2:39:46.200]  powder straight that it'll flush me out so much that I will lose weight by the
[2:39:46.200 --> 2:39:50.600]  end of the month with lighter exercise I'm gonna start exercising again tomorrow
[2:39:50.600 --> 2:39:55.520]  lightly but I want to be able to say that I lost more weight while eating the
[2:39:55.520 --> 2:40:00.320]  same and not exercising as much and I'm actually doing it I've lost two pounds in
[2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:13.560]  the last six days doing this okay I've gone down from 279 to about 225 and I'm
[2:40:13.560 --> 2:40:18.160]  gonna try to drop down to 205 in the next month and I started out about the
[2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:22.160]  fourth or so officially doing this every day about three days ago and I'm gonna
[2:40:22.160 --> 2:40:25.520]  go right through about the fourth or fifth next month and then we're gonna
[2:40:25.520 --> 2:40:29.960]  have photos taken every few days or did this last Friday and we're gonna go
[2:40:29.960 --> 2:40:34.400]  right through the month and have like a time lapse in the same spot every day
[2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:38.520]  taking a photo or every few days so I can't do it on the weekend obviously and
[2:40:38.520 --> 2:40:42.040]  then composite those together to see what the weight loss is like with my
[2:40:42.040 --> 2:40:47.160]  shirt off and who knows we have enough postcards from the ladies all stripped
[2:40:47.160 --> 2:40:50.600]  down to my Calvin Klein underwear whatever floats your boat I'm being
[2:40:50.600 --> 2:40:56.200]  sarcastic I'm not into brand names but they don't even make these Calvin Klein
[2:40:56.200 --> 2:40:59.520]  underwear anymore I just noticed that they're they're they're micro fiber and
[2:40:59.520 --> 2:41:01.920]  they're real thin they're real comfortable and I'll try to buy some more

[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:32.200]  to it I think I'm gonna do a special report on this for the nightly news and
[2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:35.000]  air it sometime during the week it's so important kind of like I'm having Anthony
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:39.800]  Gucci already his story is so important about how they're changing the name of
[2:42:39.800 --> 2:42:43.560]  high fructose corn syrup to trick people so they can put it back in the
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:49.160]  food as folks stop buying it her she's hinds that they've all taken it out of
[2:42:49.160 --> 2:42:55.600]  their foods their candies their their condiments and so now they're changing the
[2:42:55.600 --> 2:42:59.960]  name we're just gonna fight that that's a big article that he put out that went
[2:42:59.960 --> 2:43:03.720]  out of like five this morning he wrote last night and so I'm having on the
[2:43:03.720 --> 2:43:06.280]  nightly news tonight talk about it same thing some things are so important I
[2:43:06.280 --> 2:43:12.240]  want to highly produce it so then I can air on the radio the next day because
[2:43:12.240 --> 2:43:17.920]  the TV nightly news kind of feeds into this broadcast as you know geo
[2:43:17.920 --> 2:43:22.000]  engineering scientists terrified of projects he helped create an excuse for
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:25.600]  weather modification programs dr. Matthew Watson from Bristol University in the
[2:43:25.600 --> 2:43:29.040]  UK told the media recently he's terrified by many of geoengineering
[2:43:29.040 --> 2:43:31.720]  projects currently in the works to thwart man-made climate change a
[2:43:31.720 --> 2:43:35.400]  phenomenon being hawked as an excuse for weather modification programs by many
[2:43:35.400 --> 2:43:39.120]  mainstream scientists as a threat to humanity but see now Bill Gates gets to
[2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:42.000]  get billions to run the fleet of aircraft to spray the clouds to quote
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:46.600]  save you dr. Watson recently told the UK Daily Mail online that he's terrified
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:50.520]  because the potential for misstep is considerable oh you mean use it as a
[2:43:50.520 --> 2:43:54.640]  weather weapon and then it's a misstep it's a giant 30-year program at least
[2:43:54.640 --> 2:43:58.720]  they keep the thing completely sacred I had been living since the father of
[2:43:58.720 --> 2:44:02.240]  weather weapons he's on record the father of weather weapons when it was
[2:44:02.240 --> 2:44:06.040]  declassified on the show four times then he got threatened and wouldn't come
[2:44:06.040 --> 2:44:15.360]  back on a living legend in world war two was the first guy to fly bombers to get
[2:44:15.360 --> 2:44:21.480]  data into hurricanes and into typhoons typhoons are in the Pacific and go a
[2:44:21.480 --> 2:44:26.520]  lot faster and rotate the other direction he flew fighter attacks directing
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:32.880]  aircraft on over several hundred missions over combat zones in Vietnam he
[2:44:32.880 --> 2:44:36.800]  I'm kind of going off on the Jag here and then it was declassified so he thought
[2:44:36.800 --> 2:44:40.960]  he could speak out about how he was controlling hurricanes by the early
[2:44:40.960 --> 2:44:45.040]  60s and had it certified by Stanford Research Institute and the Navy and
[2:44:45.040 --> 2:44:50.320]  the Rockefeller Foundation by 1967 they were creating hurricanes steering
[2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:55.120]  hurricanes directing hurricanes and lessening the power of hurricanes now
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:44:59.080]  that was with aircraft in spring now they've got antennas with the aircraft
[2:44:59.080 --> 2:45:05.440]  that ionized things and manipulated and that's been declassified we're not in
[2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:11.280]  Kansas anymore go read the full article all right let's continue here we're
[2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:14.120]  gonna go to your calls and then into the smart TVs but I've already kind of
[2:45:14.120 --> 2:45:18.320]  covered that oh they're smart like space probes from another planet come to
[2:45:18.320 --> 2:45:22.240]  enslave us and I don't mean that literally it's an allegory to get people
[2:45:22.240 --> 2:45:26.800]  to realize the magnitude just because it's our own species if a green alien
[2:45:26.800 --> 2:45:30.040]  was torturing a kid in the basement it'd be just as bad as if Jeffrey Dahmer was
[2:45:30.040 --> 2:45:33.680]  doing it is what I'm saying but people will be more freaked out of it was an
[2:45:33.680 --> 2:45:39.240]  alien with tentacles 11 predictions of economic disaster in 2015 from top
[2:45:39.240 --> 2:45:44.100]  experts all over the world will 2015 to the year financial crashes economic

[2:45:51.360 --> 2:45:55.720]  free fall right now in most areas Michael Schneider breaks it all down in
[2:45:55.720 --> 2:46:02.480]  one of his excellent boil downs bill Fleckenstein
[2:46:02.480 --> 2:46:15.200]  says that basically the markets are gonna crash John finance says in the US
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:18.920]  professor Robert Schiller's politically adjusted price earnings ratio or
[2:46:18.920 --> 2:46:24.920]  Schiller cap is S&P 500 is currently 27.2 it goes in all the technicals
[2:46:24.920 --> 2:46:28.400]  Ambrose Evans Pritchard one of the most respected economic journalists the
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:35.740]  entire planet to the quote the eurozone will be deflation by February for
[2:46:35.740 --> 2:46:41.180]  lonely trying to ignite its damp wood by rubbing stones real interest rates will
[2:46:41.180 --> 2:46:44.500]  ratchet higher the banks will still give themselves free money that's what he
[2:46:44.500 --> 2:46:48.220]  means by that the debt level continue to rise at a faster pace than normal GDP
[2:46:48.220 --> 2:46:53.860]  across club med Mediterranean the region will sink deeper into compound
[2:46:53.860 --> 2:46:59.580]  interest trap Jerome levy forecasting center I don't have time to read all
[2:46:59.580 --> 2:47:04.060]  this it's just I mean you heard all these to you I mean look you heard
[2:47:04.060 --> 2:47:09.980]  Donald Trump come out and say get ready for collapse plummeting oil prices drag
[2:47:09.980 --> 2:47:16.060]  S&P 500 to three months low because see the stock market's high because of
[2:47:16.060 --> 2:47:21.460]  inflation and devalued dollars yen yarn and other currencies but when a
[2:47:21.460 --> 2:47:26.500]  commodity's forced down artificially it will drag down other commodities and I
[2:47:26.500 --> 2:47:32.940]  see the stock market as a bubble commodity basically a flim flam commodity
[2:47:33.780 --> 2:47:37.060]  it's like a latrine there's some real water in there but most of its other
[2:47:37.060 --> 2:47:41.700]  things and and it's just gonna pull it all down McCain and other top officials
[2:47:41.700 --> 2:47:44.860]  accused me legally visiting Syria well yeah they violated federal law and they
[2:47:44.860 --> 2:47:48.780]  did that there's some articles on that I want to go to your calls right now and
[2:47:48.780 --> 2:47:53.380]  then I'll kind of range over some of the other stuff I haven't gotten to yet oh
[2:47:53.380 --> 2:47:58.260]  there's so much here I should do another fourth hour Dom in California you're a
[2:47:58.260 --> 2:48:02.580]  trooper for holding you want to talk about geoengineering so go ahead yeah
[2:48:02.580 --> 2:48:07.100]  first off I want to say you helped me find Christ and I've been helping others
[2:48:07.100 --> 2:48:10.820]  find them so it's a chain reaction you know and I got all the products being
[2:48:10.820 --> 2:48:14.260]  that I'm in a heavy geoengineering area in California here I got the lung
[2:48:14.260 --> 2:48:20.020]  cleanse the nason iodine the silver bullet at the oxy powder man and I
[2:48:20.020 --> 2:48:23.860]  swear man I feel like Superman I get up at six in the morning and start
[2:48:23.860 --> 2:48:28.020]  filming these chemtrails and you know I'm ready to fight these guys every day
[2:48:28.020 --> 2:48:31.420]  so I warn as many people make a documentary get the word out I want to
[2:48:31.420 --> 2:48:35.780]  be clear true nascent crystal source iodine the X2 is the only product that
[2:48:35.780 --> 2:48:39.100]  has it anywhere that's just a fact people trying to find out where we get it in
[2:48:39.100 --> 2:48:43.420]  the rest of it only folks that knows the DEA is going to jump through all their
[2:48:43.420 --> 2:48:46.140]  hopes to get it because it can be used for so many other things and it's raw
[2:48:46.140 --> 2:48:52.500]  form this stuff is the good halogen it removes the bad halogens that's why it's
[2:48:52.500 --> 2:48:57.500]  so dynamic sorry go ahead so that's what I was calling about you know you said do
[2:48:57.500 --> 2:49:00.660]  something about and you always tell everybody that and I was inspired by
[2:49:00.660 --> 2:49:05.420]  your show so a few weeks ago they were spraying heavy and all these web started
[2:49:05.420 --> 2:49:09.260]  falling out of the trails I got samples of it I filmed the whole thing and that
[2:49:09.260 --> 2:49:14.060]  led me to your nightly news episode with Marie Snow and her friend Corey out in
[2:49:14.060 --> 2:49:19.540]  Arizona who had all that web stuff and started the Facebook group and I've
[2:49:19.540 --> 2:49:26.020]  since talked to them and got the lab that we could send these webs to to get
[2:49:26.020 --> 2:49:32.540]  the toxic metal test done and we we did a video for this and we went and bought
[2:49:32.540 --> 2:49:36.620]  Kimchacers.com we put the video up there you could see all the webs falling out of
[2:49:36.620 --> 2:49:39.820]  the Kim trail and we've been non-stop chasing these jets ever since and let me
[2:49:39.820 --> 2:49:44.180]  guess I bet you got a ton of viewers we got a ton of viewers and everyone
[2:49:44.180 --> 2:49:49.060]  supports it they say God's with us we follow these jets all around California
[2:49:49.060 --> 2:49:52.700]  and show the trails turning. We'll see what you're doing and if other people do it on
[2:49:52.700 --> 2:49:56.340]  different issues it will bring the system down we're not fighting in a
[2:49:56.340 --> 2:50:01.060]  vacuum now we're establishment media sits there and lectures us on 50 TV
[2:50:01.060 --> 2:50:05.660]  channels or 20 TV channels or three like they had in the 50s we now are
[2:50:05.660 --> 2:50:10.020]  everywhere and if we all just start reporting on what we see truthfully it
[2:50:10.020 --> 2:50:14.540]  will cause others to question it'll be a chain reaction and then it's over for
[2:50:14.540 --> 2:50:18.780]  the tech takeover and when techles I'm worried there's gonna be such a backlash
[2:50:18.780 --> 2:50:22.340]  against this globalist infected tech that we're gonna have a bunch of
[2:50:22.340 --> 2:50:26.700]  troglodyte movements to stop all technology which I'm not for but this is
[2:50:26.700 --> 2:50:30.100]  gonna be epic tell folks so where people can see your YouTube channel or

[2:55:15.260 --> 2:55:21.460]  color of our skin and they're selling a revolution you stop corruption by
[2:55:21.460 --> 2:55:28.620]  shooting a cop that's like you stop arson by burning your house down
[2:55:30.620 --> 2:55:36.740]  unbelievable we're gonna go to Crane and then Richard and others Crane you're on
[2:55:36.740 --> 2:55:42.340]  the air from Texas go ahead welcome
[2:55:42.340 --> 2:55:47.460]  so yeah what I wanted to kind of talk about was how you had mentioned this
[2:55:47.460 --> 2:55:52.700]  pedophilia scandal going on and Stanley Kubrick with his last film was
[2:55:52.700 --> 2:55:59.420]  trying to send the message of that whole world of you know Illuminati lavish
[2:55:59.420 --> 2:56:03.460]  masquerades and things like that I don't know if you have seen the movie but a lot
[2:56:03.460 --> 2:56:08.260]  of secret messages in there you know there's a George Soros character I
[2:56:08.260 --> 2:56:12.140]  happen to be one of the only people in the last 15 years has interviewed the
[2:56:12.140 --> 2:56:16.140]  daughter of Stanley Kubrick who was kind of helped him direct some of his
[2:56:16.140 --> 2:56:21.220]  later films did the music on him his protege I think we ought to try to get
[2:56:21.220 --> 2:56:25.940]  her back on the show she's an amazing lady Vivian Kubrick so that interview on
[2:56:25.940 --> 2:56:30.140]  the radio and TV is there she did talk some about Eyes Wide Shut she told me
[2:56:30.140 --> 2:56:36.260]  privately some of the things about it which actually are very interesting but
[2:56:36.260 --> 2:56:42.300]  that she didn't really make me at liberty to tell anybody but it's just really
[2:56:42.300 --> 2:56:47.660]  amazing information I've got to get Vivian Kubrick to come on and talk about
[2:56:47.660 --> 2:56:52.220]  all that stuff sometime it's just really really interesting but what was your
[2:56:52.220 --> 2:56:56.700]  point about it well no I mean just just the fact that he was killed and he died
[2:56:56.700 --> 2:57:00.260]  three days after the movie was completed I mean there's some I mean he was
[2:57:00.260 --> 2:57:03.660]  pretty much just sending a message to the people in on the world that this is
[2:57:03.660 --> 2:57:07.100]  kind of how the Illuminati were well he died of that heart attack I think
[2:57:07.100 --> 2:57:16.820]  mysteriously and again I forget what I was allowed to talk about what I'm not
[2:57:16.820 --> 2:57:24.900]  allowed to talk about let's put it to you this way the establishment was not
[2:57:24.900 --> 2:57:32.940]  happy with a bunch of stuff Stanley Kubrick did and when you get into it he
[2:57:32.940 --> 2:57:37.300]  died mysteriously and then they cut 25 minutes out of the film so let's be
[2:57:37.300 --> 2:57:41.420]  clear he died before way before it was to come out and they cut stuff out of it
[2:57:41.420 --> 2:57:45.140]  I'm just gonna leave it at that that's on record that's what happened and I
[2:57:45.140 --> 2:57:49.260]  covered it back when it happened in the late 90s and it was it just bizarre
[2:57:49.260 --> 2:57:53.780]  Twilight Zone then be talking to his daughter about it Vivian Kubrick is a
[2:57:53.780 --> 2:57:57.060]  listener of the show simply amazing anything else
[2:57:57.060 --> 2:58:05.100]  oh it'd be real neat be real neat talk about John Lennon what really happened
[2:58:05.100 --> 2:58:11.100]  there too but I'm not allowed to talk about it because and the people I've
[2:58:11.100 --> 2:58:15.060]  talked to go you don't know what it's like yet I'm like well they've harassed
[2:58:15.060 --> 2:58:21.180]  me have they killed your dad have they killed your husband and then come and
[2:58:21.180 --> 2:58:23.780]  told you you'll be dead if you talk I mean that's kind of stuff that goes on
[2:58:23.780 --> 2:58:27.060]  with these celebrities get killed not talking about John Lennon or anything I
[2:58:27.060 --> 2:58:32.220]  mean it's just it's real folks and John Lennon woke up to the limonade and was
[2:58:32.220 --> 2:58:35.940]  speaking out against it right before he got killed they were scared of it well
[2:58:35.940 --> 2:58:39.780]  they ride back stay with us in overdrive

[3:00:43.140 --> 3:00:52.420]  ahead also like you I'm following history and you know the beginning of World War
[3:00:52.420 --> 3:00:57.980]  One you know started by the Archduke Ferdinand or whatever name was you know
[3:00:57.980 --> 3:01:01.700]  if you were fascinated yeah the Archduke Ferdinand yeah he was killed by a
[3:01:01.700 --> 3:01:08.100]  black-hand secret society by British intelligence okay well with the lowering
[3:01:08.100 --> 3:01:16.580]  of gas prices bankrupting Russia do you think that that may trigger I mean you
[3:01:16.580 --> 3:01:21.740]  know the wars you have been starting you know for some lot less than this do you
[3:01:21.740 --> 3:01:25.380]  think that this may start oh yeah well there's already proxy wars with real
[3:01:25.380 --> 3:01:29.100]  combat dead in Ukraine and all over and again it's not that Russia's good guys
[3:01:29.100 --> 3:01:33.100]  it's just they didn't start it George Soros didn't he's ten times worse than
[3:01:33.100 --> 3:01:37.220]  my view than Putin I mean he's a living Nazi collaborator I just just somebody
[3:01:37.220 --> 3:01:41.300]  pinched me I gotta wake up here and and yes the thing is there's nuclear weapons
[3:01:41.300 --> 3:01:45.740]  so they think Russia won't ever use them so it's like a bluff it's because of
[3:01:45.740 --> 3:01:50.180]  mutually assured destruction you'll let us attack you and it's just playing with
[3:01:50.180 --> 3:01:59.860]  fire brother what do you think I agree I've been watching almost all of your
[3:01:59.860 --> 3:02:10.020]  videos all your movies in and I've transcribed a bunch of them in follow
[3:02:10.020 --> 3:02:16.740]  the Republic you said that we have not had a real president since John F. Kennedy
[3:02:16.740 --> 3:02:22.140]  and I was I've said that to people and they say well what about Reagan and I
[3:02:22.140 --> 3:02:25.860]  don't have a response well Reagan I don't think was a bad go overall but it's
[3:02:25.860 --> 3:02:28.180]  pretty clear we've interviewed people that knew him we're in there he was more
[3:02:28.180 --> 3:02:33.940]  of a puppet and had some good ideas but it's so complex then he got shot at first
[3:02:33.940 --> 3:02:37.420]  he was a little bit better he got shot and then after that it looks like they
[3:02:37.420 --> 3:02:40.500]  would kind of put him on sleeping pills till he was needed they didn't kind of
[3:02:40.500 --> 3:02:45.060]  get him on stuff to wake him up kind of rolling him out I mean George Robert
[3:02:45.060 --> 3:02:48.980]  Walker Bush was right on the show thanks for the call Regina in PA you're on the
[3:02:48.980 --> 3:02:53.980]  air go ahead okay Alex I watched the vote today on the C-span and I just wanted
[3:02:53.980 --> 3:02:57.620]  to share something that I thought was real interesting congressman Robbocker
[3:02:57.620 --> 3:03:01.340]  right before the vote was standing you know the vote for Speaker of the House
[3:03:01.340 --> 3:03:05.860]  Remainer was standing and he's from California he's pretty highly acclaimed
[3:03:05.860 --> 3:03:10.020]  you know supposedly conservative no no we've had him on the show okay well I
[3:03:10.020 --> 3:03:12.540]  want to bring something up here that I thought was real interesting and I
[3:03:12.540 --> 3:03:16.580]  hopefully we can correlate this but congressman Orbuck was standing next to
[3:03:16.580 --> 3:03:23.380]  Louie Gomar who who was down at the Tea Party two years ago with Rand Paul
[3:03:23.380 --> 3:03:28.260]  Ted Cruz and leaders that had read from the Tea Party the total bill of the
[3:03:28.260 --> 3:03:31.100]  gang of eight and we're trying to get it stopped and sure Gomar's been on the
[3:03:31.100 --> 3:03:34.980]  show too he's a pretty good guy overall tell me what happened okay so he's
[3:03:34.980 --> 3:03:38.420]  standing next to him so I thought oh gee this is exciting maybe he'll be
[3:03:38.420 --> 3:03:42.980]  supporting he'll be supporting Gomar but when the vote come up I heard him
[3:03:42.980 --> 3:03:46.660]  support Vayner and I thought you know the same thing happened how many years
[3:03:46.660 --> 3:03:50.580]  ago when George Bush stood up and said I'm gonna put us back into UNESCO and
[3:03:50.580 --> 3:03:55.300]  Roarbacher stood there and went along with it he did not support stop funds
[3:03:55.300 --> 3:03:59.220]  for you remember I know Roarbacher's been on the show probably 15 times and
[3:03:59.220 --> 3:04:04.260]  talks a good game and then when it gets down to brass tacks but also the media
[3:04:04.260 --> 3:04:07.660]  started attacking Roarbacher before that you know bringing up stuff about him
[3:04:07.660 --> 3:04:12.740]  these people are being threatened in blackmail and at least Gomert voted to
[3:04:12.740 --> 3:04:16.860]  keep our guns and stuff so he it is a problem I didn't hear see what you saw
[3:04:16.860 --> 3:04:21.100]  I'll look at the vote but we'll be looking at this vote very closely tomorrow
[3:04:21.100 --> 3:04:26.300]  on the syndicated broadcast Regina thank you I'm out of time John in New York we
[3:04:26.300 --> 3:04:29.020]  can get your number of you want and call you back tomorrow because I want to hear
