[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
[00:04.000 --> 00:08.000]  You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
[00:08.000 --> 00:13.000]  I wanted to reach out, but I never said a thing
[00:16.000 --> 00:20.000]  I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.000]  You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.000]  I wanted to call you, but I didn't say a thing
[00:29.000 --> 00:32.000]  Two, three, four
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.000]  Oh, I'll pick you up
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.000]  If you come back to America
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  Just hit me up
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.000]  Cause this is crazy love
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.000]  I'll catch you on the flip side
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  If you come back to California
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  You should just hit me up
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.000]  If you come back to California
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  Just hit me up
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.000]  Cause this is crazy love
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.000]  I'll catch you on the flip side
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  If you come back to California
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  You should just hit me up
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  Cause this is crazy love
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  I'll catch you on the flip side
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  If you come back to California
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  You should just hit me up
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  If you come back to California
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  You should just hit me up
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  Cause this is crazy love
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  I'll catch you on the flip side
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  If you come back to California
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  You should just hit me up
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  Cause this is crazy love
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  I'll catch you on the flip side
[02:21.000 --> 02:28.040]  I'd subvert the churches first. I'd begin with a campaign of whispers with the wisdom of the serpent
[02:28.040 --> 02:33.800]  I would whisper to you as I whispered to you do as you please to the young I would whisper that the Bible is a myth
[02:33.800 --> 02:37.460]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around
[02:37.460 --> 02:43.560]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square and the old I would teach to pray
[02:43.760 --> 02:47.620]  after me our father which art in Washington
[02:47.620 --> 02:55.060]  and then I'd get organized I'd educate authors in how to make the Lord at literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and
[02:55.060 --> 03:03.220]  uninteresting I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa I'd pedal narcotics to whom I could I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of
[03:03.220 --> 03:10.620]  distinction I'd tranquilize the rest with pills if I were the devil I'd soon have families at war with themselves
[03:10.620 --> 03:20.060]  churches at war with themselves and nations at war with themselves until each in its turn was consumed and with promises of higher ratings
[03:20.060 --> 03:23.540]  I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the play
[03:23.540 --> 03:27.220]  The president of the United States is racist
[03:27.220 --> 03:33.620]  If I were the devil I would encourage schools to refine young intellects but neglect the discipline of motions just like those run wild
[03:33.620 --> 03:39.120]  Within a decade I'd have prisons overflowing I'd have judges promoting pornographic
[03:39.120 --> 03:46.120]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse then from the schoolhouse and then from the houses of congress and in his own churches
[03:46.120 --> 03:49.120]  I would substitute psychology for religion
[03:49.120 --> 03:58.120]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money if I were the devil I'd take from those who have and
[03:58.120 --> 04:04.120]  give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious
[04:04.120 --> 04:06.120]  I would caution against extremes
[04:06.120 --> 04:10.120]  I'm here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up this isn't a game
[04:10.120 --> 04:18.120]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct I would convince the young that marriage is old fashioned that swinging is more fun
[04:18.120 --> 04:29.120]  that what you see on TV is the way to be and thus I could undress you in public and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure
[04:29.120 --> 04:38.120]  In other words if I were the devil I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing
[04:52.120 --> 04:58.120]  Now you know the rest of the story
[04:58.120 --> 05:02.120]  Band.video is the answer to censorship
[05:02.120 --> 05:13.120]  Band.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform
[05:13.120 --> 05:18.120]  where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are still available
[05:18.120 --> 05:21.120]  We've launched it ladies and gentlemen, it's now live
[05:21.120 --> 05:30.120]  Band.video, Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson band videos
[05:30.120 --> 05:35.120]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted
[05:35.120 --> 05:41.120]  and where a growing list of freedom loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down
[05:41.120 --> 05:48.120]  free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum and the globalist
[05:48.120 --> 05:53.120]  Freedom of Speech has a home, it's called Band.video
[05:53.120 --> 06:19.120]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at Band.video
[06:23.120 --> 06:37.120]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at Band.video
[06:37.120 --> 06:43.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is September 23, 2019 on this Monday edition, I'm your host Alex Jones
[06:43.120 --> 06:53.120]  We have Andrew Pollock, the father that lost one of his children at the tragic events last February 14th
[06:53.120 --> 06:57.120]  In Florida where the police stood down and let the massacre take place
[06:57.120 --> 07:01.120]  Well he said that Bloomberg and the anti-gunners don't speak for him
[07:01.120 --> 07:07.120]  Andrew Pollock had a lot of courage in joining us at the bottom of the hour
[07:07.120 --> 07:15.120]  Now I remember listening to Rush Limbaugh when I was just one year out of high school
[07:15.120 --> 07:21.120]  and I remember listening to him when I was at work during the breaks
[07:21.120 --> 07:26.120]  and I remember going and looking up the things he was talking about and finding out they were true and being amazed
[07:26.120 --> 07:37.120]  and he would play the audio of Jocelyn Elders over and over again saying what you do with the kindergartners, that's how she speaks
[07:37.120 --> 07:42.120]  as you reach down and you help the master brains
[07:42.120 --> 07:46.120]  and then she went to Congress and talked about it
[07:46.120 --> 07:50.120]  but that was pre-internet really
[07:50.120 --> 07:55.120]  and I spent an hour and a half this morning obsessively
[07:55.120 --> 07:59.120]  trying to find it, I found one edited version
[07:59.120 --> 08:04.120]  it's like a joke video of her saying it but it's a bunch of cuts, but it is her saying it
[08:04.120 --> 08:08.120]  but there's transcripts, she's on record and people say where did that come from
[08:08.120 --> 08:15.120]  we need to talk, the main thing is we need to reach down and touch their peepees
[08:15.120 --> 08:17.120]  touch their weewees
[08:17.120 --> 08:21.120]  she actually, it's a really sick audio, we're gonna play it
[08:21.120 --> 08:25.120]  I don't want to apologize, why would the government want to do that?
[08:25.120 --> 08:33.120]  because if they can get their pedophile teachers to be able to touch your children's genitals
[08:33.120 --> 08:40.120]  they can get away with anything, I mean that's kind of planting the flag
[08:40.120 --> 08:45.120]  in ancient Japan and also in ancient Europe, feudal Europe, feudal Japan
[08:45.120 --> 08:50.120]  there would be an act of pissing on you to humiliate you sometimes
[08:50.120 --> 08:52.120]  or sometimes they'd just chop your head off for talking back
[08:52.120 --> 08:55.120]  feudal Europe, Europe, Japan, both of it
[08:55.120 --> 09:01.120]  but when they can put their hands on your daughter's vagina or your little son's penis
[09:01.120 --> 09:05.120]  sorry to use those terms, this was happening to your kids
[09:05.120 --> 09:11.120]  if they can do that, they can do anything and they are
[09:11.120 --> 09:15.120]  and the headline on infowars.com and newswars.com for this live show
[09:15.120 --> 09:18.120]  where you can email it out and text it out and share it
[09:18.120 --> 09:28.120]  it's official, the left supports pedophilia worldwide
[09:28.120 --> 09:34.120]  and they're coming after your children, with vaccines they're gonna put in them, GMO
[09:34.120 --> 09:38.120]  it's official that it's endorsed pedophilia worldwide
[09:38.120 --> 09:44.120]  and just last week, San Diego State University
[09:44.120 --> 09:48.120]  we have photos and videos of the curriculum in the class, it says pedophilia is just
[09:48.120 --> 09:58.120]  a sexual preference and opposing it is not homophobic but pedophobic
[09:58.120 --> 10:03.120]  don't they're now saying pedophobic and it's gonna be stunning and brave
[10:03.120 --> 10:10.120]  vice and HBO and salon and the New York Times are coming out and endorsing pedophilia
[10:10.120 --> 10:15.120]  a wrecking of child's innocence of their bodies, destroying their futures
[10:15.120 --> 10:18.120]  I mean all they have to show is sexually abused children have massive problems
[10:18.120 --> 10:23.120]  way statistically higher suicide and then ruined lives and they pass it on
[10:23.120 --> 10:31.120]  in many cases, about half the cases, they think love is having sex with a small child
[10:31.120 --> 10:34.120]  this is a sick cancer, we have cancer
[10:34.120 --> 10:36.120]  now why do I raise that today?
[10:36.120 --> 10:42.120]  well because children as young as six are being given compulsory self touching lessons
[10:42.120 --> 10:47.120]  that critics say are sexualizing youngsters, oh critics that's the Daily Mail
[10:47.120 --> 10:52.120]  and that's in England, Australia and the US and Canada are all announcing it
[10:52.120 --> 10:58.120]  so it's sleepy time after lunch where you lay down for half the hour
[10:58.120 --> 11:02.120]  and then you read a story after and the kids lay down on little mats
[11:02.120 --> 11:07.120]  well now like Jocelyn Elders said that's a quote, it's compulsory
[11:07.120 --> 11:10.120]  the teachers are going to help
[11:10.120 --> 11:14.120]  and some teachers are quitting, oh that's the plan
[11:14.120 --> 11:17.120]  then it's only gonna be pedos or their fellow travelers
[11:17.120 --> 11:19.120]  and some parents are saying my kids are being taken out of school
[11:19.120 --> 11:23.120]  oh England's saying oh no, your kids are gonna go to mosque as part of compulsory nationwide
[11:23.120 --> 11:30.120]  and we're gonna touch their genitals, we're gonna plant the flag
[11:30.120 --> 11:34.120]  so this is directly from the classroom of your TV viewer, that's what they're teaching
[11:34.120 --> 11:38.120]  all about me, the state wants to put their hands on your children's junk
[11:38.120 --> 11:42.120]  and teach them sexualization, total pedophilia
[11:42.120 --> 11:45.120]  the final frontier is getting your kids
[11:45.120 --> 11:49.120]  maybe we'll have somebody like Caitlyn Jenner come out and tell us it's stunning and brave
[11:49.120 --> 11:53.120]  we're gonna go to break with this key report, we're gonna come back and break it all down
[11:53.120 --> 11:57.120]  please stay with us, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today
[11:57.120 --> 12:00.120]  I've never been a vain person
[12:00.120 --> 12:03.120]  I've never been obsessed with my looks
[12:03.120 --> 12:09.120]  and I never claimed to look like a supermodel or something out of a Calvin Klein catalogue
[12:09.120 --> 12:16.120]  but when I don't eat right, when I don't take supplements, when I don't exercise
[12:16.120 --> 12:20.120]  I look like basically Fred Flintstone
[12:20.120 --> 12:29.120]  but just in the last month I decided to religiously take the supplements from infowarslife.com
[12:29.120 --> 12:31.120]  that I already know were so good
[12:31.120 --> 12:35.120]  and voila, just doing that and drinking more water
[12:35.120 --> 12:39.120]  my workouts are better, my stamina, my focus, my energy
[12:39.120 --> 12:44.120]  it's just incredible that I've lost 12 pounds in a month
[12:44.120 --> 12:47.120]  since I committed to myself and sat on air
[12:47.120 --> 12:50.120]  and I was gonna start taking the supplements religiously
[12:50.120 --> 12:52.120]  now that's a pretty amazing statement to make
[12:52.120 --> 12:55.120]  but it's true and I've been through this before
[12:55.120 --> 12:59.120]  Michael and I was 16 or 17 years old and played football
[12:59.120 --> 13:05.120]  I could eat two pizzas and then an entire half gallon of Bluebell Dutch Chocolate Ice Cream
[13:05.120 --> 13:08.120]  on the weekends and I looked great and had a six pack
[13:08.120 --> 13:11.120]  and by the time I was about 22 years old or so
[13:11.120 --> 13:14.120]  I quit working out as much but kept eating the same
[13:14.120 --> 13:17.120]  and I gained 90 pounds
[13:17.120 --> 13:20.120]  for a decade I basically didn't take care of myself
[13:20.120 --> 13:22.120]  and turned into job in the high
[13:22.120 --> 13:27.120]  and then it took me four to five years to even lose 25, 30 pounds
[13:27.120 --> 13:32.120]  but as soon as I started taking the X2 Super High Quality Eye and Eye
[13:32.120 --> 13:34.120]  the missing link in my body
[13:34.120 --> 13:39.120]  as soon as I started taking Super Melvachale other products about six, seven years ago
[13:39.120 --> 13:42.120]  boom, I lost another 40 pounds
[13:42.120 --> 13:44.120]  in the last few years
[13:44.120 --> 13:47.120]  I just stopped taking it all the time, forgot about it
[13:47.120 --> 13:49.120]  and caught myself a few months ago
[13:49.120 --> 13:52.120]  literally taking nothing but fish oil and knockout
[13:52.120 --> 13:55.120]  when I went to sleep at night and occasionally smile at night
[13:55.120 --> 13:58.120]  and I realized that I'd stopped giving it to my children
[13:58.120 --> 14:00.120]  maybe once a week
[14:00.120 --> 14:02.120]  and I've seen the difference in them and myself
[14:02.120 --> 14:07.120]  when we go on the regimen of the top products in a forward life
[14:07.120 --> 14:09.120]  I want you to experience this for yourself
[14:09.120 --> 14:12.120]  I want to challenge you that if you haven't ever tried the products
[14:12.120 --> 14:13.120]  to order them
[14:13.120 --> 14:16.120]  you cannot lose because you're funding
[14:16.120 --> 14:19.120]  a pro-America, pro-second amendment
[14:19.120 --> 14:22.120]  pro-freedom organization that has proven
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.120]  it has absolutely damaged the globalists and their operations
[14:26.120 --> 14:30.120]  and put forward a pro-American pro-human agenda in a big way
[14:30.120 --> 14:33.120]  that is spread not just across the US but across the world
[14:33.120 --> 14:35.120]  the globalists, the corporate media
[14:35.120 --> 14:38.120]  they are desperate, the whole Hollywood crew
[14:38.120 --> 14:40.120]  all the fake prostitutes to take us off the gear
[14:40.120 --> 14:43.120]  but thanks for your support, we're still here
[14:43.120 --> 14:45.120]  but pulling back from that
[14:45.120 --> 14:49.120]  you need to really take the products for yourself regardless
[14:49.120 --> 14:52.120]  and see how amazing they are because we've done the research
[14:52.120 --> 14:55.120]  and just like our information on politics
[14:55.120 --> 14:57.120]  and what's happening in the world
[14:57.120 --> 14:59.120]  is the very best cutting edge
[14:59.120 --> 15:02.120]  feared by tyrants and corporations everywhere
[15:02.120 --> 15:06.120]  the research that we've done with top scientists, researchers
[15:06.120 --> 15:09.120]  and some of the developers is the very best out there
[15:09.120 --> 15:13.120]  because we go out and look at what's already best selling
[15:13.120 --> 15:15.120]  what already has the best reviews
[15:15.120 --> 15:17.120]  what is the cleanest, what works the best
[15:17.120 --> 15:20.120]  and then we make it better and cut the price
[15:20.120 --> 15:24.120]  and that's why I'm promising you, the viewers and listeners
[15:24.120 --> 15:26.120]  and your families and those around you
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.120]  the products we bring you from InfoWarsLife are the very best
[15:30.120 --> 15:33.120]  that we could find and develop and bring to you
[15:33.120 --> 15:36.120]  and that when I use them and others use them
[15:36.120 --> 15:39.120]  you get amazing results and it funds the InfoWars
[15:39.120 --> 15:42.120]  the only way we can fail is when I don't take action
[15:42.120 --> 15:44.120]  and when you don't take action
[15:44.120 --> 15:47.120]  go to InfoWarsStore.com or ForceLife.com today

[16:56.120 --> 17:00.120]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners
[17:00.120 --> 17:03.120]  if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system
[17:03.120 --> 17:06.120]  but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up
[17:06.120 --> 17:09.120]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear
[17:09.120 --> 17:11.120]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale
[17:11.120 --> 17:14.120]  with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system
[17:14.120 --> 17:17.120]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[17:17.120 --> 17:19.120]  off the grid. The clearance price is a result
[17:19.120 --> 17:21.120]  of the historic flooding we're having here
[17:21.120 --> 17:23.120]  right on the east bank of the Mississippi
[17:23.120 --> 17:26.120]  because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory
[17:26.120 --> 17:29.120]  to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse
[17:29.120 --> 17:33.120]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable

[20:33.120 --> 20:36.120]  we have a father who lost his daughter
[20:36.120 --> 20:39.120]  at the parkland attacks
[20:39.120 --> 20:42.120]  by an individual who'd said 40 plus times
[20:42.120 --> 20:44.120]  he was going to shoot and attack people
[20:44.120 --> 20:47.120]  and the police had been called 40 plus times and nothing was done
[20:47.120 --> 20:50.120]  and then the media went and said that
[20:50.120 --> 20:52.120]  I said no one died there
[20:52.120 --> 20:55.120]  and then my name put that hurtful information out
[20:55.120 --> 20:58.120]  pretty sick isn't it
[20:58.120 --> 21:00.120]  no I said the police stood down the question is why
[21:00.120 --> 21:03.120]  well we've got
[21:03.120 --> 21:06.120]  this poor girl's father's got a lot of courage joining us
[21:06.120 --> 21:09.120]  Andrew Pollock, next segment
[21:09.120 --> 21:12.120]  let me just do this because what happens is
[21:12.120 --> 21:15.120]  I get ready for the show at home and here and then
[21:15.120 --> 21:18.120]  I end up hitting like 15 stories out of 150 on the show
[21:18.120 --> 21:21.120]  but
[21:21.120 --> 21:24.120]  I just want to be very clear with the viewers and listeners
[21:24.120 --> 21:26.120]  things are much crazier
[21:26.120 --> 21:29.120]  than we can even explain and I think you know that
[21:29.120 --> 21:32.120]  you see that in your own community
[21:32.120 --> 21:35.120]  there is a separation of people happening
[21:35.120 --> 21:38.120]  towards good or towards evil just like the Bible says
[21:38.120 --> 21:41.120]  and I just cannot
[21:41.120 --> 21:44.120]  hammer it enough that
[21:44.120 --> 21:48.120]  evil is going completely insane right now
[21:48.120 --> 21:51.120]  I have a stack
[21:51.120 --> 21:54.120]  of articles and videos we're going to cover
[21:54.120 --> 21:57.120]  at the bottom of the next hour when the
[21:57.120 --> 22:00.120]  amazing Savannah Hernandez
[22:00.120 --> 22:03.120]  I say that because she does like five jobs here
[22:03.120 --> 22:06.120]  produces, she goes out on the street
[22:06.120 --> 22:08.120]  writes articles, she does everything
[22:08.120 --> 22:11.120]  she went out in Austin to the big climate hysteria last Friday
[22:11.120 --> 22:14.120]  the article is up on inforwars.com
[22:14.120 --> 22:17.120]  and I've had it reposted
[22:17.120 --> 22:20.120]  and now the climate deniers and they're all giving scripts to follow
[22:20.120 --> 22:23.120]  they call us climate deniers, they're denying that the climate
[22:23.120 --> 22:26.120]  always changes, that's a totally truthful statement
[22:26.120 --> 22:29.120]  go ahead bring it on over, thank you for bringing me articles
[22:29.120 --> 22:32.120]  and documents right now
[22:32.120 --> 22:35.120]  continuing, getting back to what I was saying
[22:35.120 --> 22:38.120]  they tell us that it's global freezing
[22:38.120 --> 22:41.120]  and then they tell us that it's global warming
[22:41.120 --> 22:44.120]  and then they tell us it's our fault
[22:44.120 --> 22:47.120]  and they tell us that any type
[22:47.120 --> 22:50.120]  of climate change is evil
[22:50.120 --> 22:53.120]  but that if we pay carbon taxes
[22:53.120 --> 22:56.120]  to these central banks and these private families
[22:56.120 --> 22:59.120]  and let them micromanage our lives
[22:59.120 --> 23:02.120]  but China and India are exempt
[23:02.120 --> 23:05.120]  and if we have a post-industrial world then we'll be good people
[23:05.120 --> 23:08.120]  I mean this is the most ridiculous
[23:08.120 --> 23:11.120]  out of control garbage
[23:11.120 --> 23:14.120]  the world's ever seen and Breitbart put together
[23:14.120 --> 23:17.120]  40 plus examples we're going to be covering when she joins us
[23:17.120 --> 23:20.120]  of how they said the world was going to end or dire consequences
[23:20.120 --> 23:23.120]  and it didn't and they know it's not
[23:23.120 --> 23:26.120]  at least not the way they're saying
[23:26.120 --> 23:29.120]  and so that's coming up at the bottom of the hour
[23:29.120 --> 23:32.120]  because now we have video
[23:32.120 --> 23:35.120]  of these fairmongers
[23:35.120 --> 23:38.120]  running around saying
[23:38.120 --> 23:41.120]  the world has seven years left
[23:41.120 --> 23:44.120]  and then admitting
[23:44.120 --> 23:47.120]  well we're just doing this to scare people
[23:47.120 --> 23:50.120]  well we know you're doing it to scare people
[23:50.120 --> 23:53.120]  but to have them on tape the leaders
[23:53.120 --> 23:56.120]  of the Austin fairmongering
[23:56.120 --> 23:59.120]  which are following their orders directly from the Chicago
[23:59.120 --> 24:02.120]  mercantile
[24:02.120 --> 24:05.120]  and others
[24:05.120 --> 24:08.120]  and it's getting more intense
[24:08.120 --> 24:11.120]  it's getting more insane
[24:11.120 --> 24:14.120]  and these people are getting more hateful
[24:14.120 --> 24:17.120]  and more vicious
[24:17.120 --> 24:20.120]  than ever telling everyone to f off
[24:20.120 --> 24:23.120]  that questions them in any way
[24:23.120 --> 24:26.120]  this is a revolution against the west
[24:26.120 --> 24:29.120]  a revolution against our industries
[24:29.120 --> 24:32.120]  a revolution against civilization
[24:32.120 --> 24:35.120]  publicly funded
[24:35.120 --> 24:38.120]  by the Saudi Arabians and the Chai Khoms
[24:38.120 --> 24:41.120]  and a few others and you ask why is that
[24:41.120 --> 24:44.120]  and it's on record
[24:44.120 --> 24:47.120]  why are the Chai Khoms
[24:47.120 --> 24:50.120]  and Saudi Arabia funding movements
[24:50.120 --> 24:53.120]  that go after fossil fuels
[24:53.120 --> 24:56.120]  they're never going to stop the fossil fuels
[24:56.120 --> 24:59.120]  in Saudi Arabia
[24:59.120 --> 25:02.120]  or China
[25:02.120 --> 25:05.120]  they're never going to stop using them
[25:05.120 --> 25:08.120]  or producing them
[25:08.120 --> 25:11.120]  they just want the rich powerful west
[25:11.120 --> 25:14.120]  to curtail them so we can't compete and then pay
[25:14.120 --> 25:17.120]  these multinational financial scammers
[25:17.120 --> 25:20.120]  money on every gallon of oil
[25:20.120 --> 25:23.120]  or gasoline that we use
[25:23.120 --> 25:26.120]  and then every other facet of carbon on the planet
[25:26.120 --> 25:29.120]  this is crippling feudalism
[25:29.120 --> 25:32.120]  but regardless of that
[25:32.120 --> 25:35.120]  it's all one sided where
[25:35.120 --> 25:38.120]  Europe, the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia
[25:38.120 --> 25:41.120]  make the cuts and no one else does
[25:41.120 --> 25:44.120]  not Mexico
[25:44.120 --> 25:47.120]  not Brazil
[25:47.120 --> 25:50.120]  not China, not Russia
[25:50.120 --> 25:53.120]  not India, not Nigeria
[25:53.120 --> 25:56.120]  no one
[25:56.120 --> 25:59.120]  but us
[25:59.120 --> 26:02.120]  so I'll cover that at the bottom of the next hour
[26:02.120 --> 26:05.120]  and then again I'll also get into this
[26:05.120 --> 26:08.120]  the fact that all over the world
[26:08.120 --> 26:11.120]  the UNESCO
[26:11.120 --> 26:14.120]  system of the UN that is the UN that's global governance
[26:14.120 --> 26:17.120]  not a nation's cultural educational organization
[26:17.120 --> 26:20.120]  that gets all the countries to sign on the treaties
[26:20.120 --> 26:23.120]  it standardizes the global policies
[26:23.120 --> 26:26.120]  they want pedophilia legalized and NAMBLA is on their steering board
[26:26.120 --> 26:29.120]  as an NGO, North American Man-Boy Love Association
[26:29.120 --> 26:32.120]  and in Hollywood
[26:32.120 --> 26:35.120]  and all the propaganda is aimed
[26:35.120 --> 26:38.120]  is to teach you that your children
[26:38.120 --> 26:41.120]  are emancipated from you
[26:41.120 --> 26:44.120]  at birth, well they don't know how to defend themselves
[26:44.120 --> 26:47.120]  they don't know how to make decisions
[26:47.120 --> 26:50.120]  so the state and all these groups can swoop in and convince your 5 year old
[26:50.120 --> 26:53.120]  to have sex, to take deadly vaccines
[26:53.120 --> 26:56.120]  to eat GMO, to be sterilized
[26:56.120 --> 26:59.120]  because if they can do this
[26:59.120 --> 27:02.120]  and go out to the young when they're weak
[27:02.120 --> 27:05.120]  and have men shake their asses in front of their faces
[27:05.120 --> 27:08.120]  and have the children ride horsey
[27:08.120 --> 27:11.120]  and have those erections through their pants
[27:11.120 --> 27:14.120]  they can do anything
[27:14.120 --> 27:17.120]  they're cutting our power
[27:17.120 --> 27:20.120]  they're coming after our children
[27:20.120 --> 27:23.120]  this is all a plan
[27:23.120 --> 27:26.120]  that's why Jocelyn Elders in 1993
[27:26.120 --> 27:29.120]  Bill Clinton's surgeon general
[27:29.120 --> 27:32.120]  said
[27:32.120 --> 27:35.120]  we're going to teach compulsory
[27:35.120 --> 27:38.120]  we're going to teach compulsory masturbation
[27:38.120 --> 27:41.120]  quote, we're going to reach down to the kindergarteners
[27:41.120 --> 27:44.120]  and teach them how
[27:44.120 --> 27:47.120]  the kindergarten teachers will be transformed into sexualization
[27:47.120 --> 27:50.120]  high priest of Satanism
[27:50.120 --> 27:53.120]  to molest your children
[27:53.120 --> 27:56.120]  but that was back when he fired her for saying that
[27:56.120 --> 27:59.120]  surgeon general force resigned by White House
[27:59.120 --> 28:02.120]  over saying reach down
[28:02.120 --> 28:05.120]  when she says she goes reach down
[28:05.120 --> 28:08.120]  and help them
[28:08.120 --> 28:11.120]  because someone you see
[28:11.120 --> 28:14.120]  like when vice in salon articles
[28:14.120 --> 28:17.120]  they talk about the bravery of the pedophiles and how they loved children
[28:17.120 --> 28:20.120]  they cut some ball headed guy with a mullet
[28:20.120 --> 28:23.120]  drooling over a four year old dancing
[28:23.120 --> 28:26.120]  and a little scantily clad outfit and he's just drooling
[28:26.120 --> 28:29.120]  and there's no bottom to these people
[28:29.120 --> 28:32.120]  and parents will probably go to the school
[28:32.120 --> 28:35.120]  and say well I guess it's okay
[28:35.120 --> 28:38.120]  and the next it'll be
[28:38.120 --> 28:41.120]  well you're five year old because that's what they have in the school libraries
[28:41.120 --> 28:44.120]  now is stories of five, six, seven, eight year olds
[28:44.120 --> 28:47.120]  when they got molested how fun it is
[28:47.120 --> 28:50.120]  and this isn't a joke just like even the babies alive after they're born
[28:50.120 --> 28:53.120]  we're all just going to bat out into it
[28:53.120 --> 28:56.120]  and worship and turn our guns in
[28:56.120 --> 28:59.120]  no we're not
[29:26.120 --> 29:29.120]  how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel
[29:29.120 --> 29:32.120]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone

[31:34.120 --> 31:37.120]  but I've kind of obituated everybody to where everybody buys
[31:37.120 --> 31:40.120]  when it's 50% off I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off
[31:40.120 --> 31:43.120]  and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric
[31:43.120 --> 31:46.120]  the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people
[31:46.120 --> 31:49.120]  get the Patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss leader
[31:49.120 --> 31:52.120]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship
[31:52.120 --> 31:55.120]  then we'll do a 50% off and then you do something like that
[31:55.120 --> 31:58.120]  we have Patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support
[31:58.120 --> 32:02.120]  we sold secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller
[32:02.120 --> 32:05.120]  we had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula
[32:05.120 --> 32:09.120]  you are supposed to rename it that new formula is ultra 12
[32:09.120 --> 32:14.120]  it's twice as strong as secret 12 the very best vitamin B12 out there
[32:14.120 --> 32:17.120]  it's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it
[32:17.120 --> 32:19.120]  and it does amazing things
[32:19.120 --> 32:22.120]  supports healthy nerve and brain cells helps make DNA
[32:22.120 --> 32:25.120]  helps the body produce energy helps produce healthy blood cells
[32:25.120 --> 32:28.120]  essential for proper nervous system functioning goes on and on
[32:28.120 --> 32:31.120]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia,
[32:31.120 --> 32:34.120]  fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss
[32:34.120 --> 32:36.120]  asthma, vision problems and low sperm count
[32:36.120 --> 32:40.120]  bottom line folks you need ultra 12 it helps fund the info war
[32:40.120 --> 32:43.120]  so it's a 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time
[32:43.120 --> 32:45.120]  at infowarstore.com
[32:45.120 --> 32:49.120]  again we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so

[33:24.120 --> 33:29.120]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic
[33:29.120 --> 33:40.120]  it's Alex Jones
[33:40.120 --> 33:43.120]  well arising this event the murder of these kids
[33:43.120 --> 33:45.120]  you're talking about gun control
[33:45.120 --> 33:47.120]  I just had to listen to you
[33:47.120 --> 33:50.120]  and Governor Scott talk about gun control
[33:50.120 --> 33:52.120]  gun control is a big issue
[33:52.120 --> 33:56.120]  no one in America is going to come together on gun control Chris
[33:56.120 --> 33:59.120]  we're here you didn't say one thing about fixing it
[33:59.120 --> 34:03.120]  the American people we could get together on school safety
[34:03.120 --> 34:05.120]  but when you polarize it
[34:05.120 --> 34:07.120]  this event and every other media
[34:07.120 --> 34:09.120]  we don't care about gun control right now
[34:09.120 --> 34:11.120]  that's a big issue in the country
[34:11.120 --> 34:13.120]  and you're not going to get everyone together on it
[34:13.120 --> 34:17.120]  but we're going to get everyone together on fixing our schools
[34:17.120 --> 34:19.120]  and I just listened to you
[34:19.120 --> 34:23.120]  so I just listened to you you didn't talk you didn't mention one question to Governor Scott
[34:23.120 --> 34:27.120]  about what are we going to do about the security for our children
[34:27.120 --> 34:28.120]  how are we going to do that
[34:28.120 --> 34:31.120]  but you're just talking about gun control
[34:31.120 --> 34:34.120]  which is going to just give you more ratings in every other media event
[34:34.120 --> 34:37.120]  my daughter said I want to know
[34:37.120 --> 34:40.120]  our kids are going to school in Kentucky on Monday
[34:40.120 --> 34:42.120]  how are those kids safe
[34:42.120 --> 34:44.120]  how about bringing that up to the media
[34:44.120 --> 34:46.120]  how about bringing that up to Governor Scott
[34:46.120 --> 34:49.120]  not about guns it's not about guns now
[34:49.120 --> 34:52.120]  today it's not about guns it's about the safety in our schools
[34:52.120 --> 34:55.120]  and that's what you asked Governor Scott about
[34:55.120 --> 34:58.120]  and I got to listen to that at my house
[34:58.120 --> 35:02.120]  my kid my kid's not here because the schools weren't safe
[35:02.120 --> 35:03.120]  that's the main thing
[35:03.120 --> 35:06.120]  you go into a courthouse the judge is safe
[35:06.120 --> 35:10.120]  the stenographer is not worried someone's coming in with a gun
[35:10.120 --> 35:12.120]  because they can't get in with a gun
[35:12.120 --> 35:15.120]  the American people we just want our schools safe
[35:15.120 --> 35:18.120]  we don't want to talk about guns right now
[35:21.120 --> 35:23.120]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen
[35:23.120 --> 35:26.120]  Parkland first responders says he was given stand down order
[35:26.120 --> 35:29.120]  I could have saved lives remember that
[35:29.120 --> 35:33.120]  sources Coral Springs police upset at some bowered
[35:33.120 --> 35:36.120]  deputies for not entering school
[35:36.120 --> 35:39.120]  you know we had three different students on
[35:39.120 --> 35:41.120]  in the two days after it
[35:41.120 --> 35:43.120]  the media said they were fake or they weren't
[35:43.120 --> 35:45.120]  they literally had to admit that
[35:45.120 --> 35:47.120]  we had real students on saying the police stood down
[35:47.120 --> 35:49.120]  the national media made it up
[35:49.120 --> 35:52.120]  and said that I said nobody died we forced them to retract it
[35:52.120 --> 35:55.120]  but that's how vicious this corporate media is
[35:55.120 --> 35:59.120]  and the father who's had the courage to speak out against all this
[35:59.120 --> 36:02.120]  is joining us right now to go over it
[36:02.120 --> 36:05.120]  and of course Andrew Pollock joins us right now
[36:05.120 --> 36:08.120]  he lost his 18 year old daughter on that faithful day
[36:08.120 --> 36:11.120]  I couldn't even imagine that I have a 15 year old daughter
[36:11.120 --> 36:13.120]  and two and a half year old daughter
[36:13.120 --> 36:15.120]  and what he's saying is absolutely true
[36:15.120 --> 36:18.120]  what about the safety what about the stand down
[36:18.120 --> 36:21.120]  what about the maniacs like Cruz who 40 plus times
[36:21.120 --> 36:23.120]  had the police called on him saying
[36:23.120 --> 36:26.120]  I'm going to kill people at the school
[36:26.120 --> 36:29.120]  what about these anti-fanuts both in Texas and
[36:29.120 --> 36:32.120]  of course in Ohio who said we're in the occult
[36:32.120 --> 36:34.120]  we want to kill people
[36:34.120 --> 36:37.120]  I mean how are they not getting arrested I really appreciate Andrew Pollock
[36:37.120 --> 36:40.120]  coming on I could ask a lot of questions he's at Andrew Pollock
[36:40.120 --> 36:43.120]  FL on Twitter if you'd like to reach out and talk to him
[36:43.120 --> 36:47.120]  at Andrew Pollock P-O-L-L-A-C-K-F-L
[36:47.120 --> 36:50.120]  but I'd like to give him the floor in this segment the next
[36:50.120 --> 36:54.120]  so he can actually as someone who really is a victim of this this this horror
[36:54.120 --> 36:56.120]  talk about what he thinks really should be done
[36:56.120 --> 36:58.120]  thanks for coming on with us
[36:58.120 --> 37:01.120]  oh thanks for having me on Alex
[37:01.120 --> 37:03.120]  I mean it's unspeakable what you've gone through
[37:03.120 --> 37:05.120]  what others have gone through
[37:05.120 --> 37:08.120]  when we see it being politicized people like Beto O'Rourke
[37:08.120 --> 37:10.120]  blaming 100 million gun owners
[37:10.120 --> 37:13.120]  you've got the floor what would you like to say about this
[37:13.120 --> 37:16.120]  well I'm doing this down on my daughter Alex
[37:16.120 --> 37:20.120]  you know people ask me all the time how do you have the strength
[37:20.120 --> 37:24.120]  I have the strength because my daughter's not here with me anymore
[37:24.120 --> 37:28.120]  and she would want everybody in this country to know the truth
[37:28.120 --> 37:31.120]  of behind what happened and all the failures
[37:31.120 --> 37:34.120]  so that's what gives me this energy to go on
[37:34.120 --> 37:36.120]  day in and day out
[37:36.120 --> 37:39.120]  and she would want every parent to know the truth
[37:39.120 --> 37:44.120]  not what mainstream media wants everyone to make it out to be
[37:44.120 --> 37:47.120]  and which they silenced me on my book tour
[37:47.120 --> 37:50.120]  within you know I was in New York and DC
[37:50.120 --> 37:54.120]  I wasn't on one mainstream liberal channel
[37:54.120 --> 37:56.120]  none of them would have me on
[37:56.120 --> 37:58.120]  and everything in my book is true
[37:58.120 --> 38:01.120]  we got everything from the school district
[38:01.120 --> 38:04.120]  everything firsthand from my interviews
[38:04.120 --> 38:06.120]  from people that work for the school district
[38:06.120 --> 38:10.120]  and from depositions in my civil case
[38:10.120 --> 38:13.120]  so I'm here to tell parents
[38:13.120 --> 38:17.120]  you know if you really want to know what happened in Parkland
[38:17.120 --> 38:20.120]  and what's going on in these school districts across the country
[38:20.120 --> 38:24.120]  you should buy my book Why Meadow Die
[38:24.120 --> 38:27.120]  everything in there is factual
[38:27.120 --> 38:31.120]  and it lays it out because the policies in place
[38:31.120 --> 38:34.120]  in Broward throughout the whole country
[38:34.120 --> 38:37.120]  it's not just in Broward
[38:37.120 --> 38:40.120]  the governor of California just made a law
[38:40.120 --> 38:43.120]  now Gavin Newsom signed a law
[38:43.120 --> 38:48.120]  that it's illegal to suspend disruptive kids
[38:48.120 --> 38:50.120]  or expel them in a classroom
[38:50.120 --> 38:52.120]  I don't know what parent in their right mind would think
[38:52.120 --> 38:54.120]  that would create a safe environment
[38:54.120 --> 38:57.120]  but those policies started in Broward
[38:57.120 --> 39:00.120]  and it created a culture of leniency
[39:00.120 --> 39:02.120]  in the whole school district
[39:02.120 --> 39:04.120]  you know there's multiple failures
[39:04.120 --> 39:06.120]  you know the Sheriff's Department of Mental Health
[39:06.120 --> 39:08.120]  the FBI
[39:08.120 --> 39:11.120]  but when you dig into these policies
[39:11.120 --> 39:13.120]  I put it on parent now
[39:13.120 --> 39:16.120]  I dealt with politicians over the last year
[39:16.120 --> 39:18.120]  and I became good friends with them
[39:18.120 --> 39:20.120]  including the president
[39:20.120 --> 39:22.120]  if the president could wave a wand
[39:22.120 --> 39:24.120]  and make every school safe he would want to do it
[39:24.120 --> 39:27.120]  but it's out of his control when it comes to
[39:27.120 --> 39:30.120]  parents and school boards they're going to do what they want
[39:30.120 --> 39:32.120]  so that's why this book's important
[39:32.120 --> 39:34.120]  it's on the parents
[39:34.120 --> 39:36.120]  it's your responsibility mom and dad
[39:36.120 --> 39:39.120]  where you put your child in school
[39:39.120 --> 39:41.120]  and that's the bottom line
[39:41.120 --> 39:43.120]  Andrew let me interrupt you just briefly
[39:43.120 --> 39:45.120]  because I should have set this up front
[39:45.120 --> 39:47.120]  it's just being a father and thinking about what you've gone through
[39:47.120 --> 39:49.120]  I actually kind of choked up a little bit
[39:49.120 --> 39:51.120]  which I never do right when I was going to you
[39:51.120 --> 39:53.120]  I should have set up front
[39:53.120 --> 39:55.120]  you're on a real quest for your daughter's memory
[39:55.120 --> 39:57.120]  I've seen you speak about it
[39:57.120 --> 39:59.120]  you've written a book that details what caused this
[39:59.120 --> 40:01.120]  and the fact that it's happening more
[40:01.120 --> 40:03.120]  and that they've got ways to basically
[40:03.120 --> 40:05.120]  really cut this back to almost nothing
[40:05.120 --> 40:08.120]  and you lay it out with all the facts
[40:08.120 --> 40:10.120]  and then the fact that you were censored
[40:10.120 --> 40:13.120]  by the system and blackball is incredible
[40:13.120 --> 40:15.120]  so everyone watching
[40:15.120 --> 40:17.120]  and I'm talking about Joe Rogan that tunes in a lot
[40:17.120 --> 40:19.120]  I'm talking about people with some of the biggest shows in the world
[40:19.120 --> 40:21.120]  they all need
[40:21.120 --> 40:23.120]  T.I. can find out about school shootings
[40:23.120 --> 40:25.120]  he should have you on
[40:25.120 --> 40:27.120]  his podcast I'm on that
[40:27.120 --> 40:29.120]  they're going to air that Thursday
[40:29.120 --> 40:31.120]  I mean we need to get your message out
[40:31.120 --> 40:33.120]  and the big news is they're trying to put in a blockade
[40:33.120 --> 40:35.120]  of what really happened to your daughter
[40:35.120 --> 40:37.120]  and we've got to ask the question why is that
[40:37.120 --> 40:39.120]  why did they stand down
[40:39.120 --> 40:41.120]  why did they stand down so many places
[40:41.120 --> 40:43.120]  so recap getting into the book
[40:43.120 --> 40:45.120]  why meadow died the people and policies that created the parkland
[40:45.120 --> 40:47.120]  shooter and endangered america
[40:47.120 --> 40:49.120]  students will walk through it next segment
[40:49.120 --> 40:51.120]  but literally this book can and will
[40:51.120 --> 40:53.120]  save lives I mean
[40:53.120 --> 40:55.120]  nambla is putting books in public schools now
[40:55.120 --> 40:57.120]  about adults having sex with kids I literally
[40:57.120 --> 40:59.120]  covered this earlier well but I know they're trying
[40:59.120 --> 41:01.120]  to keep your book from getting into schools
[41:01.120 --> 41:03.120]  this book needs to be everywhere and every parent
[41:03.120 --> 41:05.120]  that has kids in school needs to read this
[41:05.120 --> 41:07.120]  correct
[41:07.120 --> 41:09.120]  and you know what
[41:09.120 --> 41:11.120]  teachers need to step up
[41:11.120 --> 41:13.120]  for themselves you know grow a spine
[41:13.120 --> 41:15.120]  that's what I tell all the teachers out there
[41:15.120 --> 41:17.120]  that write me that are out there
[41:17.120 --> 41:19.120]  because they're just
[41:19.120 --> 41:21.120]  blame for these policies
[41:21.120 --> 41:23.120]  if they don't speak up about it
[41:23.120 --> 41:25.120]  they have to deal with it they're left
[41:25.120 --> 41:27.120]  with these disruptive kids and these failed
[41:27.120 --> 41:29.120]  policies so we need them to educate
[41:29.120 --> 41:31.120]  the parents too so
[41:31.120 --> 41:33.120]  there's a big force of them out there and
[41:33.120 --> 41:35.120]  it's not the teachers union
[41:35.120 --> 41:37.120]  they're the worst they're just as bad
[41:37.120 --> 41:39.120]  as the fake news
[41:39.120 --> 41:41.120]  so teachers you need to step up
[41:41.120 --> 41:43.120]  to and grow a set
[41:43.120 --> 41:45.120]  and speak up for
[41:45.120 --> 41:47.120]  for your profession because teachers
[41:47.120 --> 41:49.120]  are getting abused left and right
[41:49.120 --> 41:51.120]  in the school districts across the country
[41:51.120 --> 41:53.120]  what teacher in their right mind
[41:53.120 --> 41:55.120]  is going to want to teach in California
[41:55.120 --> 41:57.120]  when they have no recourse
[41:57.120 --> 41:59.120]  of a kid that can do anything they want
[41:59.120 --> 42:01.120]  in their classroom so
[42:01.120 --> 42:03.120]  teachers it's on them also
[42:03.120 --> 42:05.120]  so some of these policies
[42:05.120 --> 42:07.120]  that I looked into Alex that
[42:07.120 --> 42:09.120]  that are very
[42:09.120 --> 42:11.120]  that were incredible there's a state law
[42:11.120 --> 42:13.120]  as you know that allowed crews to commit crimes
[42:13.120 --> 42:15.120]  and get out because he had an Hispanic last name
[42:15.120 --> 42:17.120]  he wasn't even Hispanic so he
[42:17.120 --> 42:19.120]  they have this liberal policy of letting the criminals

[42:23.120 --> 42:25.120]  well they just don't
[42:25.120 --> 42:27.120]  they believe in lack of discipline
[42:27.120 --> 42:29.120]  policies and ending
[42:29.120 --> 42:31.120]  the school to prison pipeline
[42:31.120 --> 42:33.120]  which just creates a chaotic
[42:33.120 --> 42:35.120]  environment in these school districts

[44:13.120 --> 44:15.120]  it's more important than ever

[45:55.120 --> 45:57.120]  as of taping this September 10th
[45:57.120 --> 45:59.120]  I was
[45:59.120 --> 46:01.120]  among the first 12 years ago
[46:01.120 --> 46:03.120]  to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running
[46:03.120 --> 46:05.120]  a giant governmental blackmail
[46:05.120 --> 46:07.120]  ring using pedophilia
[46:07.120 --> 46:09.120]  I was the first to warn of human animal
[46:09.120 --> 46:11.120]  hybrids
[46:11.120 --> 46:13.120]  and organ harvesting
[46:13.120 --> 46:15.120]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies
[46:15.120 --> 46:17.120]  were being kept alive after they were born
[46:17.120 --> 46:19.120]  for their organs to be harvested
[46:19.120 --> 46:21.120]  I was the first to warn you
[46:21.120 --> 46:23.120]  along with Paul Watson at infowars.com
[46:23.120 --> 46:25.120]  15 years ago that Google
[46:25.120 --> 46:27.120]  was using microphones and hidden cameras
[46:27.120 --> 46:29.120]  to record everything you do
[46:29.120 --> 46:31.120]  and hundreds and hundreds of other
[46:31.120 --> 46:33.120]  giant issues
[46:33.120 --> 46:35.120]  like the Federal Reserve being private
[46:35.120 --> 46:37.120]  run for profit trying to control our economy
[46:37.120 --> 46:39.120]  that our government in Hollywood
[46:39.120 --> 46:41.120]  have been taken over by the Communist Chinese
[46:41.120 --> 46:43.120]  on every one of these issues
[46:43.120 --> 46:45.120]  and many others we've been dead on
[46:45.120 --> 46:47.120]  and we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale
[46:47.120 --> 46:49.120]  that's why the globalists
[46:49.120 --> 46:51.120]  are trying to shut us down
[46:51.120 --> 46:53.120]  and that's why you are more critical than ever
[46:53.120 --> 46:55.120]  to support the info war
[46:55.120 --> 47:07.120]  however you can
[47:25.120 --> 47:27.120]  get the book everybody should go to the library
[47:27.120 --> 47:29.120]  every parent should read it because they've created
[47:29.120 --> 47:31.120]  these climates the studies show the media
[47:31.120 --> 47:33.120]  hypes the mass shooters and you have the incel
[47:33.120 --> 47:35.120]  mental patient type always
[47:35.120 --> 47:37.120]  in every case has been on these psychotropic drugs
[47:37.120 --> 47:39.120]  they're always saying they're going to kill people
[47:39.120 --> 47:41.120]  and then nothing's done
[47:41.120 --> 47:43.120]  Andrew Pollock has got the inside baseball
[47:43.120 --> 47:45.120]  it happened to him
[47:45.120 --> 47:47.120]  his daughters survived
[47:47.120 --> 47:49.120]  with his two sons
[47:49.120 --> 47:51.120]  and I'm told that the Thought Police didn't want
[47:51.120 --> 47:53.120]  Andrew Pollock to come on but his son Huck
[47:53.120 --> 47:55.120]  got him on the show
[47:55.120 --> 47:57.120]  so shout out to Huck
[47:57.120 --> 47:59.120]  Andrew during that short break you were letting him have it
[47:59.120 --> 48:01.120]  please repeat what you were saying during the break
[48:01.120 --> 48:03.120]  well you know I wasn't
[48:03.120 --> 48:05.120]  political before I got into this
[48:05.120 --> 48:07.120]  but then once I started learning
[48:07.120 --> 48:09.120]  about all these policies
[48:09.120 --> 48:11.120]  brought on by Democrats
[48:11.120 --> 48:13.120]  and how the Democrats in Broward refused to accept
[48:13.120 --> 48:15.120]  any responsibility
[48:15.120 --> 48:17.120]  about these policies I just started
[48:17.120 --> 48:19.120]  despising them
[48:19.120 --> 48:21.120]  and it gives me more
[48:21.120 --> 48:23.120]  it drives me more
[48:23.120 --> 48:25.120]  to expose them for what they are
[48:25.120 --> 48:27.120]  for pushing an agenda before my daughter
[48:27.120 --> 48:29.120]  was even
[48:29.120 --> 48:31.120]  buried they pushed their gun control
[48:31.120 --> 48:33.120]  agenda even the superintendent
[48:33.120 --> 48:35.120]  of Broward County a Democrat
[48:35.120 --> 48:37.120]  the sheriff a Democrat we all know
[48:37.120 --> 48:39.120]  he was removed for his failed policies
[48:39.120 --> 48:41.120]  but they were pushing an agenda
[48:41.120 --> 48:43.120]  and they thought that Mr Pollock
[48:43.120 --> 48:45.120]  was just going to let everything go and brush it
[48:45.120 --> 48:47.120]  under the rug but I
[48:47.120 --> 48:49.120]  I wasn't
[48:49.120 --> 48:51.120]  an agenda guy my daughter was murdered
[48:51.120 --> 48:53.120]  I'm just going to tell you the facts
[48:53.120 --> 48:55.120]  I wanted to know how I dropped
[48:55.120 --> 48:57.120]  my daughter off at that school
[48:57.120 --> 48:59.120]  who failed her and what policies
[48:59.120 --> 49:01.120]  were in place that led to this
[49:01.120 --> 49:03.120]  and that's how I came
[49:03.120 --> 49:05.120]  to my conclusion with my book
[49:05.120 --> 49:07.120]  and that's why I despise Democrats
[49:07.120 --> 49:09.120]  and it's all laid out in there
[49:09.120 --> 49:11.120]  if they would have just came to me
[49:11.120 --> 49:13.120]  these Democrats of Broward and said you know
[49:13.120 --> 49:15.120]  we understand these mistakes we made
[49:15.120 --> 49:17.120]  and we're going to fix it Mr Pollock
[49:17.120 --> 49:19.120]  we're going to let it happen again
[49:19.120 --> 49:21.120]  we apologize we're going to make the
[49:21.120 --> 49:23.120]  adjustments I would have been okay with it
[49:23.120 --> 49:25.120]  but they don't know the meaning of the word
[49:25.120 --> 49:27.120]  responsibility
[49:27.120 --> 49:29.120]  and I'm going to hold them all accountable
[49:29.120 --> 49:31.120]  I've been doing it we removed the sheriff
[49:31.120 --> 49:33.120]  the deputy that hit
[49:33.120 --> 49:35.120]  outside and let my daughter
[49:35.120 --> 49:37.120]  get shot nine times and murdered
[49:37.120 --> 49:39.120]  he's been brought up on felony charges
[49:39.120 --> 49:41.120]  so that's good
[49:41.120 --> 49:43.120]  the school board because
[49:43.120 --> 49:45.120]  we happen to get a great governor
[49:45.120 --> 49:47.120]  we get a Florida
[49:47.120 --> 49:49.120]  a Republican governor may I say
[49:49.120 --> 49:51.120]  Ron DeSantis he
[49:51.120 --> 49:53.120]  dropped a grand jury investigation
[49:53.120 --> 49:55.120]  into the school board in Broward
[49:55.120 --> 49:57.120]  which meant a lot to me
[49:57.120 --> 49:59.120]  because it's all about accountability
[49:59.120 --> 50:01.120]  and with this book why Meadow died
[50:01.120 --> 50:03.120]  I want parents and grandparents
[50:03.120 --> 50:05.120]  like I telling you
[50:05.120 --> 50:07.120]  you're responsible where you drive your kids
[50:07.120 --> 50:09.120]  you take them to the school bus
[50:09.120 --> 50:11.120]  they go to the school
[50:11.120 --> 50:13.120]  you take them to the school
[50:13.120 --> 50:15.120]  these policies are in place there's a good chance
[50:15.120 --> 50:17.120]  your kids not going to get shot
[50:17.120 --> 50:19.120]  but you could be putting them next
[50:19.120 --> 50:21.120]  to a kid on those psychotrophics
[50:21.120 --> 50:23.120]  like you talk about you could talk
[50:23.120 --> 50:25.120]  you could put them next to a kid that's
[50:25.120 --> 50:27.120]  committing multiple crimes for school
[50:27.120 --> 50:29.120]  you had selling drugs you know
[50:29.120 --> 50:31.120]  and why put your kid in an environment
[50:31.120 --> 50:33.120]  like that when if you read my
[50:33.120 --> 50:35.120]  book which I call now is like a manual
[50:35.120 --> 50:37.120]  into what happened in Broward
[50:37.120 --> 50:39.120]  and
[50:39.120 --> 50:41.120]  throughout the whole country like I said
[50:41.120 --> 50:43.120]  there's no law now in California
[50:43.120 --> 50:45.120]  you can't arrest you can't
[50:45.120 --> 50:47.120]  expel
[50:47.120 --> 50:49.120]  or suspend disruptive kids
[50:49.120 --> 50:51.120]  that's what's going on
[50:51.120 --> 50:53.120]  that's what they call in Broward
[50:53.120 --> 50:55.120]  but it goes by other names
[50:55.120 --> 50:57.120]  throughout the whole country
[50:57.120 --> 50:59.120]  and you know what
[50:59.120 --> 51:01.120]  what's going on now with this democrat platform
[51:01.120 --> 51:03.120]  is so I met with the president
[51:03.120 --> 51:05.120]  Alex after this
[51:05.120 --> 51:07.120]  in the Oval Office and we discussed
[51:07.120 --> 51:09.120]  school safety and he put together
[51:09.120 --> 51:11.120]  a commission
[51:11.120 --> 51:13.120]  of his cabinet members
[51:13.120 --> 51:15.120]  to look into school safety
[51:15.120 --> 51:17.120]  and what policies are good
[51:17.120 --> 51:19.120]  what policies are failed
[51:19.120 --> 51:21.120]  and he came up with over a hundred recommendations
[51:21.120 --> 51:23.120]  and one of them that meant a lot to me
[51:23.120 --> 51:25.120]  was he rescinded
[51:25.120 --> 51:27.120]  these Obama-era leniency policies
[51:27.120 --> 51:29.120]  which create
[51:29.120 --> 51:31.120]  this chaotic environment in schools
[51:31.120 --> 51:33.120]  which give teachers no rights
[51:33.120 --> 51:35.120]  the students that want to learn
[51:35.120 --> 51:37.120]  have no rights
[51:37.120 --> 51:39.120]  disruptive kids
[51:39.120 --> 51:41.120]  who are also emotionally
[51:41.120 --> 51:43.120]  emotionally unstable
[51:43.120 --> 51:45.120]  they give them more rights
[51:45.120 --> 51:47.120]  so this is what's going on
[51:47.120 --> 51:49.120]  and the platform for democrats
[51:49.120 --> 51:51.120]  for 20-20 one of them is
[51:51.120 --> 51:53.120]  to bring back those Obama policies
[51:53.120 --> 51:55.120]  and put them in schools
[51:55.120 --> 51:57.120]  more schools throughout the country
[51:57.120 --> 51:59.120]  so that's why I'm out here fighting
[51:59.120 --> 52:01.120]  you know hey parent
[52:01.120 --> 52:03.120]  it doesn't matter what your affiliation is
[52:03.120 --> 52:05.120]  now what a party you want your kids
[52:05.120 --> 52:07.120]  in an environment
[52:07.120 --> 52:09.120]  where the teacher can't suspend the kid
[52:09.120 --> 52:11.120]  or it's okay for the kid to sell drugs
[52:11.120 --> 52:13.120]  or it's okay for the kid to talk back
[52:13.120 --> 52:15.120]  to the teacher to come to go after themselves
[52:15.120 --> 52:17.120]  or worse
[52:17.120 --> 52:19.120]  and that's what's going on
[52:19.120 --> 52:21.120]  and mainstream media
[52:21.120 --> 52:23.120]  doesn't want to push it
[52:23.120 --> 52:25.120]  they don't want to tell you the truth
[52:25.120 --> 52:27.120]  they gave those kids which
[52:27.120 --> 52:29.120]  accomplished zero in Florida
[52:29.120 --> 52:31.120]  all those kids that much for our lives kids
[52:31.120 --> 52:33.120]  the only thing they accomplished
[52:33.120 --> 52:35.120]  was getting media attention
[52:35.120 --> 52:37.120]  that was the only thing they did
[52:37.120 --> 52:39.120]  we got the bill passed in Florida
[52:39.120 --> 52:41.120]  me and another father
[52:41.120 --> 52:43.120]  we made it so teachers are able
[52:43.120 --> 52:45.120]  to be armed in schools
[52:45.120 --> 52:47.120]  there was more money
[52:47.120 --> 52:49.120]  for mental health
[52:49.120 --> 52:51.120]  some red flag laws that some people
[52:51.120 --> 52:53.120]  approve of and
[52:53.120 --> 52:55.120]  some people don't
[52:55.120 --> 52:57.120]  so Florida is much safer
[52:57.120 --> 52:59.120]  because of what some of the parents got done
[52:59.120 --> 53:01.120]  nothing to do with what the
[53:01.120 --> 53:03.120]  media wants you to make out
[53:03.120 --> 53:05.120]  that these much for our lives kids
[53:05.120 --> 53:07.120]  who are on a bus tour
[53:07.120 --> 53:09.120]  make a noise that's all they did
[53:09.120 --> 53:11.120]  can you speak to
[53:11.120 --> 53:13.120]  how they took
[53:13.120 --> 53:15.120]  four drama students
[53:15.120 --> 53:17.120]  whose parents are anti-gun liberals
[53:17.120 --> 53:19.120]  and then made them the whole face
[53:19.120 --> 53:21.120]  because I know not just you but I saw some of the other parents say
[53:21.120 --> 53:23.120]  that CNN had town halls
[53:23.120 --> 53:25.120]  I think it was you particularly though
[53:25.120 --> 53:27.120]  but then they would try to get you to write your questions
[53:27.120 --> 53:29.120]  before and they were basically
[53:29.120 --> 53:31.120]  censoring out or trying to censor out
[53:31.120 --> 53:33.120]  parents who weren't going with
[53:33.120 --> 53:35.120]  this anti-second amendment agenda
[53:35.120 --> 53:37.120]  well I don't know enough
[53:37.120 --> 53:39.120]  about it Alec to speak about it
[53:39.120 --> 53:41.120]  I try to stay
[53:41.120 --> 53:43.120]  you know what I mean CNN I don't know
[53:43.120 --> 53:45.120]  you got to do CNN live you know
[53:45.120 --> 53:47.120]  that's it you can't go where they can
[53:47.120 --> 53:49.120]  tape you on CNN where they can edit you
[53:49.120 --> 53:51.120]  but you know I'm here to talk to
[53:51.120 --> 53:53.120]  any parent I don't really care even if
[53:53.120 --> 53:55.120]  you're a Democrat I'll try and talk some sense
[53:55.120 --> 53:57.120]  into you but
[53:57.120 --> 53:59.120]  other than that I don't really know I know those kids
[53:59.120 --> 54:01.120]  one kid
[54:01.120 --> 54:03.120]  came out of it
[54:03.120 --> 54:05.120]  and he helped us Cameron Kasky
[54:05.120 --> 54:07.120]  but these other kids they're not interested
[54:07.120 --> 54:09.120]  in fixing anything all they're interested
[54:09.120 --> 54:11.120]  is in pushing an anti-gun
[54:11.120 --> 54:13.120]  agenda
[54:13.120 --> 54:15.120]  and that's not the solution
[54:15.120 --> 54:17.120]  the solution is when people
[54:17.120 --> 54:19.120]  make threats no matter what
[54:19.120 --> 54:21.120]  age they need to be arrested when they threaten
[54:21.120 --> 54:23.120]  people's lives and charge with a felony
[54:23.120 --> 54:25.120]  we need to take it serious
[54:25.120 --> 54:27.120]  we need to take mental illness serious
[54:27.120 --> 54:29.120]  when someone's of
[54:29.120 --> 54:31.120]  you know a danger to themselves and others
[54:31.120 --> 54:33.120]  they need to be committed
[54:33.120 --> 54:35.120]  you know what I mean if they're that much of a danger
[54:35.120 --> 54:37.120]  commit them and have them evaluated
[54:37.120 --> 54:39.120]  so these things go on their background
[54:39.120 --> 54:41.120]  check this way background
[54:41.120 --> 54:43.120]  checks work Democrats are
[54:43.120 --> 54:45.120]  pushing background checks
[54:45.120 --> 54:47.120]  but if a background check
[54:47.120 --> 54:49.120]  only works if you enforce laws
[54:49.120 --> 54:51.120]  that are in place
[54:51.120 --> 54:53.120]  and this isn't common sense
[54:53.120 --> 54:55.120]  what I'm saying
[54:55.120 --> 54:57.120]  some of these people don't get it
[54:57.120 --> 54:59.120]  what good is a background check
[54:59.120 --> 55:01.120]  the killer that killed my daughter
[55:01.120 --> 55:03.120]  would have passed the background check
[55:03.120 --> 55:05.120]  he passed the background check
[55:05.120 --> 55:07.120]  he bought his gun legally
[55:07.120 --> 55:09.120]  so nothing that the Democrats are pushing for
[55:09.120 --> 55:11.120]  right now would make a difference
[55:11.120 --> 55:13.120]  in these mass shootings
[55:13.120 --> 55:15.120]  where my daughter was killed
[55:15.120 --> 55:17.120]  or you know it's the same thing
[55:17.120 --> 55:19.120]  with the Dayton shooter
[55:19.120 --> 55:21.120]  the Dayton Ohio shooter threatened
[55:21.120 --> 55:23.120]  people's lives he had a rape less
[55:23.120 --> 55:25.120]  never arrested
[55:25.120 --> 55:27.120]  my daughter's murderer
[55:27.120 --> 55:29.120]  they had to frisk him every morning
[55:29.120 --> 55:31.120]  before school they never told the parents
[55:31.120 --> 55:33.120]  I put that in that's in the book
[55:33.120 --> 55:35.120]  and no backpack
[55:35.120 --> 55:37.120]  he wasn't allowed with a backpack
[55:37.120 --> 55:39.120]  in Broward County
[55:39.120 --> 55:41.120]  they allowed four misdemeanors for school year
[55:41.120 --> 55:43.120]  without ever meeting
[55:43.120 --> 55:45.120]  law enforcement
[55:45.120 --> 55:47.120]  so all these things in Broward
[55:47.120 --> 55:49.120]  and they're still going on
[55:49.120 --> 55:51.120]  the same people are running
[55:51.120 --> 55:53.120]  Broward
[55:53.120 --> 55:55.120]  but this fall there was
[55:55.120 --> 55:57.120]  2,000 less students enrolled
[55:57.120 --> 55:59.120]  in Broward County
[55:59.120 --> 56:01.120]  charter schools you can't get in
[56:01.120 --> 56:03.120]  private schools you can't get in
[56:03.120 --> 56:05.120]  and the public school system just keeps deteriorating
[56:05.120 --> 56:07.120]  on the people like this Robert Runcy
[56:07.120 --> 56:09.120]  who's the superintendent
[56:09.120 --> 56:11.120]  and like I said
[56:11.120 --> 56:13.120]  parents read my manual
[56:13.120 --> 56:15.120]  don't put your children in an unsafe environment
[56:15.120 --> 56:17.120]  like I did I got to live with it
[56:17.120 --> 56:19.120]  you have no excuse
[56:19.120 --> 56:21.120]  now read my book
[56:21.120 --> 56:23.120]  why metal died and learn the fact
[56:23.120 --> 56:25.120]  well I got to tell you
[56:25.120 --> 56:27.120]  you're a very articulate stand up guy
[56:27.120 --> 56:29.120]  I imagine your sons are pretty amazing people
[56:29.120 --> 56:31.120]  I imagine their mom's an amazing person
[56:31.120 --> 56:33.120]  and I just cannot imagine
[56:33.120 --> 56:35.120]  losing a daughter
[56:35.120 --> 56:37.120]  and then knowing the police stood down
[56:37.120 --> 56:39.120]  again the book by Andrew Pollock
[56:39.120 --> 56:41.120]  is a manual on how to stop this across the country
[56:41.120 --> 56:43.120]  to implement what President Trump has done
[56:43.120 --> 56:45.120]  removing Obama's directives
[56:45.120 --> 56:47.120]  being carried out as he said
[56:47.120 --> 56:49.120]  why metal died everybody should
[56:49.120 --> 56:51.120]  get the book
[56:51.120 --> 56:53.120]  and I would tweet it out but they took me off twitter
[56:53.120 --> 56:55.120]  and the big thing was last year
[56:55.120 --> 56:57.120]  the final thing was
[56:57.120 --> 56:59.120]  the stand down of the police and they lied
[56:59.120 --> 57:01.120]  and said that I said nobody died
[57:01.120 --> 57:03.120]  and then took me off the internet over it
[57:03.120 --> 57:05.120]  with you as you said earlier
[57:05.120 --> 57:07.120]  they literally had a blackout on you
[57:07.120 --> 57:09.120]  on mainstream media it's just incredible
[57:09.120 --> 57:11.120]  and they did you know
[57:11.120 --> 57:13.120]  what's important to find out
[57:13.120 --> 57:15.120]  about some accountability
[57:15.120 --> 57:17.120]  we removed the sheriff
[57:17.120 --> 57:19.120]  Ron DeSantis is first week in office
[57:19.120 --> 57:21.120]  removed the sheriff
[57:21.120 --> 57:23.120]  and one deputy has been charged
[57:23.120 --> 57:25.120]  with felonies that didn't
[57:25.120 --> 57:27.120]  go into building
[57:27.120 --> 57:29.120]  and I think three or four
[57:29.120 --> 57:31.120]  also will
[57:31.120 --> 57:33.120]  Andrew stay right there a little bit more with us
[57:33.120 --> 57:35.120]  we appreciate you being here
[57:35.120 --> 57:37.120]  I want to talk about because we've all now seen the photos
[57:37.120 --> 57:39.120]  the witnesses I mean they just stood there for like 15 minutes
[57:39.120 --> 57:41.120]  what the hell kind of cowards are these
[57:41.120 --> 57:43.120]  you want to be a school safety officer
[57:43.120 --> 57:45.120]  and then you sit on your fat ass
[57:45.120 --> 58:13.120]  people will be right back
[58:15.120 --> 58:17.120]  we are not done winning
[58:17.120 --> 58:19.120]  with your support
[58:19.120 --> 58:21.120]  we will keep winning
[58:21.120 --> 58:23.120]  we have to keep winning
[58:23.120 --> 58:25.120]  we have to win more
[58:25.120 --> 58:27.120]  go to infowarestore.com
[58:27.120 --> 58:29.120]  you have gone to infowarestore.com
[58:29.120 --> 58:31.120]  and gotten books and films
[58:31.120 --> 58:33.120]  supplements and t-shirts
[58:33.120 --> 58:35.120]  and water feet
[58:35.120 --> 58:37.120]  and you all know
[58:37.120 --> 58:39.120]  the story of your life
[58:39.120 --> 58:40.120]  you're going to the
[58:40.120 --> 58:43.120]  infowar store
[58:43.120 --> 58:47.700]  films, supplements, t-shirts, and water filtration, air filtration, and things you need.
[59:13.120 --> 59:20.120]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones, or David Knight, or Owen Troyer, or Paul Watson band videos.
[59:20.120 --> 59:25.120]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted.
[59:25.120 --> 59:33.120]  And where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored,
[59:33.120 --> 59:38.120]  free from being silenced by Big Tech, The Chai Combs, The Hollywood Scum, and The Globlest.
[59:38.120 --> 59:43.120]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band.video.
[59:43.120 --> 1:00:05.120]  America and the World is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:24.120]  I don't want to inject myself into this story, but we were just talking during the break.
[1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:30.120]  Andrew Pollock had lost his daughter Meadow last Valentine's Day. That makes it rough, even more rough.
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:36.120]  They're in Parkland when the police stood down on the Coward County Sheriff's Department there and tried to cover it up.
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:43.120]  But I was telling Mr. Pollock that he will get the calls and the stories.
[1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:49.120]  Father of Parkland's shooting goes on Sandy Hook Denier's show. That's what they do is attack the messenger.
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:54.120]  But we're going to be taking action this week against one of the media outlets that said,
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:59.120]  I lost a suit over a book saying no one died at Sandy Hook.
[1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:02.120]  I didn't write the book. I'm not in the book. It's a total fake story.
[1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:08.120]  And they use that to then do all sorts of stuff to my companies, to my sponsors, and everything.
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:12.120]  So we are filing suit on a major company Thursday, guaranteed.
[1:01:12.120 --> 1:01:16.120]  Robert Barnes is going to be here in studio. We're filing suit on somebody else Wednesday.
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:21.120]  I'm not litigious, but I got to stand up for myself at this point when they're writing 100% fake stuff.
[1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:24.120]  Let me tell you, I've experienced what Trump's experienced on a smaller scale.
[1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:29.120]  A lot of this stuff is 100% fake. And you think, OK, they don't lie that bad.
[1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:32.120]  No, yes, they do. Or they try to blackmail you.
[1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:36.120]  So, Andrew Pollack, we appreciate you being here. Please come back again.
[1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:38.120]  We have about four minutes in the short segment.
[1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:42.120]  What other key points would you like to add to folks?
[1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:47.120]  Well, parents booked it at kids, and they're really the first line of defense.
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:52.120]  They know if there's disruptive kids. They knew this kid was going to be the shooter.
[1:01:52.120 --> 1:02:00.120]  You know, it took them about eight months in middle school from the teacher taking certain notes.
[1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:06.120]  They said he wanted, if you can imagine, they have notes from him in middle school that said he wanted to kill.
[1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:11.120]  He was interested in the Civil War because there was so much killing going on.
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:14.120]  He would shoot kids up, pretend with his pencil all the time.
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:20.120]  They had to tie his desk down. Security had to walk him from class to class.
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:27.120]  OK, he couldn't walk by himself. And he said he wanted to kill when he was in middle school,
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:30.120]  but they still allowed him to go to the high school.
[1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:33.120]  They were just hoping this happened. I mean, I got to say it.
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:36.120]  The way they stood down, the way 40-plus times he said he was going to kill people,
[1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:42.120]  the way the FBI was called, I mean, they had to know this was going to happen.
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:47.120]  Well, they did, but they were following these liberal policies that they didn't,
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:52.120]  that's really what they were doing. And everything was policy, not political correctness.
[1:02:52.120 --> 1:02:59.120]  No kid, you know, this kid was labeled special needs, so he had more rights than anyone else.
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:05.120]  God forbid, you know, they took, like I said, these background checks only work if they arrest him.
[1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:12.120]  He trespassed at the school after he said he was going to shoot the school up and no one did anything.
[1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:13.120]  Unbelievable.
[1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:17.120]  Yeah, so it's pretty sad. I got to live with it. And that's what this book is.
[1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:20.120]  I don't want any other parent to have to deal with what I got to do.
[1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:23.120]  Oh, you were telling me that the books sold out most of the time. I know why.
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:24.120]  I'm going to read this.
[1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:29.120]  You can't even get it. You can't even find a copy anywhere, Alex. It's crazy.
[1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:32.120]  But people should order it. And then when it's being printed right now, you were telling me,
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:36.120]  and they'll get it because I want to buy a bunch and promote this because you are a father.
[1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:40.120]  You went through this. The anti-gunners want to use these deaths to take all our guns.
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:43.120]  Instead of stopping it, they know they're hyping it. They know they're helping trigger it.
[1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:45.120]  And I think we need to go on a major offensive.
[1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:49.120]  Why Meadow died at Amazon.com. Get it right now.
[1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:51.120]  And again, a five-star review.
[1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:54.120]  Please come back on again, Andrew, as soon as they attack you in the media,
[1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:58.120]  because we should talk about the second leg of this that we know is coming.
[1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:00.120]  I want to shout out to Huck and your other son.
[1:04:00.120 --> 1:04:02.120]  Tell me about these great sons you got.
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:11.120]  Oh, they're great, man. Two different ones. Just so proud of both of them, what they did for their advocacy
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:16.120]  in school safety. And then they're by my side. They're my generals, you know, anything I need.
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:19.120]  They're there for me. My son Hunter is so proud of him.
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:25.120]  He worked all summer in D.C. with Senator Scott up in D.C., helping him and interning.
[1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:32.120]  My other son's the one to my left in that picture is Huck. He's a listener of the show.
[1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:39.120]  He's doing finance in bulk or atone. He's interested in the stock market and Bitcoin and trading
[1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:43.120]  and really smart kids. And they didn't deserve this, you know.
[1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:46.120]  It's one thing for a father to have to live with losing their daughter.
[1:04:46.120 --> 1:04:49.120]  But, you know, you also feel for your sons.
[1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:52.120]  Absolutely. Andrew Pollock, we're going to talk to you again soon.
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:55.120]  God bless you. We really appreciate you. We'll be right back, folks.
[1:05:22.120 --> 1:05:31.120]  It's going to run as long as supplies last across the board, at least 50% off, store-wide,
[1:05:31.120 --> 1:05:35.120]  free shipping, double-patriot points, and more.
[1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:39.120]  We've not done this, ladies and gentlemen, since last Christmas.
[1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:45.120]  But I want you to take advantage of this. We need funds to run our operations so it is a win-win.
[1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:49.120]  We're going into 2020. InfoWars needs the funds. Plus, these are great products.
[1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:56.120]  Go take advantage of them right now at infowarsstore.com or infowarslife.com or triple-eight, 253-3139.
[1:06:20.120 --> 1:06:25.120]  I got to tell you, if you just joined us, we'll post it later, the video in the audio,
[1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:30.120]  to infowars.com and newswars.com. Andrew Pollock is an impressive dad.
[1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:33.120]  He lost his daughter at Parkland.
[1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:41.120]  And it makes me really mad that last February, thousands of publications,
[1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:45.120]  every newspaper, basically, and every cable show and news program,
[1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:52.120]  60-minutes, Dateline NBC, all of them said that I said no one died at Parkland.
[1:06:52.120 --> 1:06:59.120]  When we had not one, not two, but three students on, and showed video of the news getting interviews,
[1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:03.120]  but people shot cell phone footage of what the news was getting interviews of students,
[1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:07.120]  saying the police stood down for 15 minutes, they were all standing around,
[1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:11.120]  they did nothing, the school resource office were begging for help, wouldn't come in.
[1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:22.120]  While the psycho, the police had been called on 44 times, walked around shooting people.
[1:07:22.120 --> 1:07:25.120]  Think about that.
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:33.120]  And then they turn around and say that I said nobody died, so all those parents hate me.
[1:07:33.120 --> 1:07:38.120]  That father had been told that stuff, but his son set him straight.
[1:07:38.120 --> 1:07:41.120]  He was sick.
[1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:45.120]  And they tell him, oh, you know, the media, oh, don't go on his show.
[1:07:45.120 --> 1:07:50.120]  So people don't hear about how the school's been made, these areas to come kill people,
[1:07:50.120 --> 1:07:56.120]  and how they're protecting under Democrat policies, these actions.
[1:07:56.120 --> 1:08:03.120]  They know exactly what they're doing, but thank God for DrudgeReport.com.
[1:08:03.120 --> 1:08:07.120]  Because they took me off YouTube and everywhere last February with that lie,
[1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:13.120]  but Drudge linked to the two videos of what I and Ellen really said about the police stand down.
[1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:17.120]  We've got 14 million views, the two videos together.
[1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:21.120]  And they had to put it back up and said, Bloomberg said it was a mistake.
[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:26.120]  We talked to YouTube, employees inside did this and there was a mutiny.
[1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:32.120]  Well, they just cooked up some new lies and took me off the air on the Internet a few months later.
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:38.120]  But I warned everybody then I said they're coming for you and what happened last week?
[1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:42.120]  They came out and said we're going after the NRA's banking.
[1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:44.120]  We're going after their credit card processors.
[1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:46.120]  We're going to find out who's NRA members.
[1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:48.120]  We're going to come after them.
[1:08:48.120 --> 1:08:50.120]  We've listed the NRA as a terror group.
[1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:51.120]  That was two weeks ago.
[1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:55.120]  And now everybody's calling me and I'm seeing articles everywhere.
[1:08:55.120 --> 1:08:59.120]  We first broke this last week.
[1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:03.120]  What happened to Caitlin Bennett and Millie Weaver on their Facebooks.
[1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:08.120]  Photos from a year and a half ago of them in a shooting range, shooting legal firearms and legal range.
[1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:12.120]  And they said this is part of a criminal terrorist organization.
[1:09:12.120 --> 1:09:17.120]  Then if you do it again, you'll be banned.
[1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:19.120]  Think about that.
[1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:27.120]  So one of my friends that has a big Facebook yesterday put up a video without my name on it.
[1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:31.120]  Of me at the range shooting with my son yesterday morning.
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:37.120]  And Facebook shadow banned it where you could see it on his phone, but not on any other computer.
[1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:43.120]  So you think you're posting it, but no one's seeing it.
[1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:48.120]  That's AI control.
[1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:56.120]  And then meanwhile Facebook, Google, Apple go after all their competition like GAV and others and try to shut down their servers, shut down their companies.
[1:09:56.120 --> 1:10:02.120]  They sick sleeping giants, 3 million Democrats on them with threats, death threats to companies.
[1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:07.120]  I mean, this stuff is just what the left does is incredible.
[1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:09.120]  It's an information takeover.
[1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:11.120]  It's far beyond censorship.
[1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:15.120]  It's organized criminal racketeering.
[1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:20.120]  And there's a big article out and I'm going to hit all the other news.
[1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:29.120]  From Gateway Pundit that Drudge links to seems like every couple of days I see it on there.
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:32.120]  And I'm probably missing most of the links, but I'm on Drudge hours a day.
[1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:34.120]  It's like m4s.com and newswords.com.
[1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:35.120]  But I got to say it.
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:37.120]  Drudge report is better than m4s.
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:39.120]  The way it's all laid out nice and clean.
[1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:44.120]  It's simplicity is the complexity and the internet's going back to that.
[1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:45.120]  We're redesigning m4s.
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:47.120]  I'm not going to rip off drugs, but it's going to be a lot cleaner.
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:52.120]  Just like summit.news, Paul's new site.
[1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:53.120]  And there's Gateway Pundit.
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:54.120]  And I like Jim Hoff.
[1:10:54.120 --> 1:10:55.120]  We should have him on and talk about this.
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:59.120]  But he's saying what happened to Matt, Drudge and Ann Coulter?
[1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:03.120]  America needs them now more than ever.
[1:11:03.120 --> 1:11:06.120]  And they go on to say basically 90% of its mainstream news.
[1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:09.120]  Well, that's not even true.
[1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:12.120]  You know, I would ask what happened to Trump?
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:20.120]  And I'm not saying Trump isn't great on fighting the fentanyl and the open borders and the
[1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:25.120]  deindustrialization and the shutoff of our coal and a lot of other stuff.
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:33.120]  But Trump's done very little other than support the states doing antitrust.
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:36.120]  But by then they'll steal the 2020 and reverse it all.
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:38.120]  I mean, we need action now.
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:40.120]  And we keep hearing from Trump.
[1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:41.120]  He's taking tough action.
[1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:43.120]  Let's see it last year.
[1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:46.120]  Two years ago, man.
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:54.120]  I mean, I don't know even what Jim Hoff's really getting at here.
[1:11:54.120 --> 1:11:56.120]  Because I mean, that sounds like media matters.
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:04.120]  You know, telling Drudge what Drudge needs to do.
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:06.120]  I mean, I think we all need to do more.
[1:12:06.120 --> 1:12:09.120]  We all need to build our own video platforms, our own audio platforms.
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:13.120]  We've done it.
[1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:15.120]  And everybody needs to support those.
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:17.120]  Instead, I'll tell you what goes on with conservative media.
[1:12:17.120 --> 1:12:20.120]  I'm going to talk about Jim Hoff.
[1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:22.120]  There's going to be a big announcement tomorrow.
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:24.120]  Even bigger ones on Wednesday and Thursdays.
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:26.120]  I was going to file a suit a couple of weeks ago.
[1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:27.120]  We had it all set up.
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:32.120]  But Barnes wanted to wait and see how the attorney general's filed their suit so that it lines up with theirs.
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:35.120]  If it's being directed by the White House, which it is.
[1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:38.120]  So we'll be more successful.
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:41.120]  And so we're going to file one suit on Wednesday and another suit on Thursday.
[1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:52.120]  Barnes gets in the night to defend the First Amendment at a critical time.
[1:12:52.120 --> 1:13:05.120]  But you pull back from all of this and you see other major sites out there.
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:24.120]  And you learn about the end fighting and the inside baseball and how I was talking to an individual yesterday about the censorship on a major platform and how they were going to expose some of the inside workings of that tomorrow.
[1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:32.120]  And then they go, oh, hey, but listen, we're going to publish this here.
[1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:36.120]  And they just don't want you to really link to their thing.
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:39.120]  Why don't you just do your own thing?
[1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:41.120]  And I'm like, okay, yeah, that's fine.
[1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:44.120]  But I said, how much of the conversation with these people was about me?
[1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:46.120]  Well, it was quite a bit.
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:56.120]  That's why we're going to lose this thing is that I'm not doing this to be the biggest talk show host or to be the most successful.
[1:13:56.120 --> 1:14:04.120]  I'm doing this because they're teaching kindergartners how to masturbate and the teachers are starting to grab their genitals.
[1:14:04.120 --> 1:14:05.120]  That's pedophilia.
[1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:11.120]  That's them planting the flag that we own your kids.
[1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:14.120]  And the 5g is killing people.
[1:14:14.120 --> 1:14:16.120]  It's in the studies that gives you cancer.
[1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:18.120]  Thank God Switzerland's protesting.
[1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:26.120]  And the government is involved in a global governance compact.
[1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:29.120]  Even NBC now says a global governance director of climate control.
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:32.120]  This isn't air conditioning in your house.
[1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:34.120]  This isn't central heating and cooling.
[1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:35.120]  And it's so far gone.
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:40.120]  There's this whole breakaway civilization.
[1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:44.120]  And it's playing God and Trump's the president now.
[1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:49.120]  And he damn well knows about all this. I know all about it.
[1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:55.120]  My dad got invited to join it when he was in high school at UT plan to didn't join it.
[1:14:55.120 --> 1:14:58.120]  At least the first time around.
[1:14:58.120 --> 1:15:01.120]  But the point is, is that this is real folks.
[1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:02.120]  Okay.
[1:15:02.120 --> 1:15:07.120]  We are in a primitive primitive frozen level.
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:08.120]  New iPhones come out.
[1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:09.120]  That's about it.
[1:15:09.120 --> 1:15:11.120]  40 year old technology.
[1:15:11.120 --> 1:15:13.120]  They've got cures for everything already.
[1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:14.120]  Okay.
[1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:15.120]  Basically.
[1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:18.120]  And there's a breakaway civilization.
[1:15:18.120 --> 1:15:20.120]  The future isn't evenly distributed.
[1:15:20.120 --> 1:15:23.120]  And they're so disconnected from us now.
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:25.120]  The ruling scientific class.
[1:15:25.120 --> 1:15:29.120]  That they're now telling us, oh, by the way, we're about to get rid of all of you for the earth.
[1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:31.120]  And they're moving forward with it.
[1:15:31.120 --> 1:15:34.120]  So I'm just guessing Matt Drudge is a little pissed about that probably.
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:36.120]  Like I am.
[1:15:36.120 --> 1:15:38.120]  Because Trump started the right direction.
[1:15:38.120 --> 1:15:40.120]  We're going to release the secret medical stuff.
[1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:43.120]  Release the secret technology, new patents and things to cause a new renaissance.
[1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:44.120]  But it hasn't happened.
[1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:47.120]  And we're bogged down instead.
[1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:48.120]  And I'm angry.
[1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:49.120]  I'm upset.
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:54.120]  Because there's a whole other real world out there that humanity built that's been stolen from us.
[1:15:54.120 --> 1:16:21.120]  We're right back.
[1:16:24.120 --> 1:16:50.120]  We're right back.
[1:16:50.120 --> 1:17:16.120]  We're right back.
[1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:42.120]  We're right back.
[1:17:42.120 --> 1:18:04.120]  We're right back.
[1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:30.120]  We're right back.
[1:18:30.120 --> 1:18:57.120]  We're right back.
[1:18:57.120 --> 1:19:03.120]  We are working with Silicon Valley to make you better health.
[1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:12.120]  Once we have full control, we send you to re-education camp like we do our people when they talk back to the party.
[1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:17.120]  Whatever you do, do not visit band.video.
[1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:28.120]  Band.video is evil Americans who Silicon Valley is teaching to shut up like China do.
[1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:32.120]  Hey, I told you don't go to band.video.
[1:19:32.120 --> 1:19:35.120]  I'm watching you.
[1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:38.120]  Our system has been adopted worldwide.
[1:19:38.120 --> 1:19:43.120]  Soon we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[1:19:43.120 --> 1:19:47.120]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[1:19:47.120 --> 1:20:16.120]  Do what CNN says and do not visit band.video or I have to hurt you.
[1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:23.120]  It's going to be with us for the next two segments starting next segment.
[1:20:23.120 --> 1:20:28.120]  We're going to play a really wild report.
[1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:31.120]  Not just around the country, but here in Austin.
[1:20:31.120 --> 1:20:33.120]  First it was the world's going in in 12 years.
[1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:37.120]  Then Beto said 11 after you know to outdo AOC.
[1:20:37.120 --> 1:20:39.120]  And then that moved on to seven years.
[1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:43.120]  And this is the talking points and then the woman who's one of the organizers and meds.
[1:20:43.120 --> 1:20:45.120]  Oh, we're just scaring people.
[1:20:45.120 --> 1:20:49.120]  You know, and that's why you target elementary school students and scare the daylights out of them.
[1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:51.120]  They teach them penguins are dying.
[1:20:51.120 --> 1:20:53.120]  They teach them that they can't swim.
[1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:55.120]  It's the polar bears can't swim.
[1:20:55.120 --> 1:20:57.120]  They hunt on the ice flows.
[1:20:57.120 --> 1:21:00.120]  They're not drowning polar bear numbers are five times what they were in the 50s.
[1:21:00.120 --> 1:21:07.120]  But some middle school girls commit suicide because they're taught the earth is so bad.
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:10.120]  So that is all coming up next segment.
[1:21:10.120 --> 1:21:14.120]  In fact, here's a clip of what we're going to be breaking down.
[1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:16.120]  Not 12 years.
[1:21:16.120 --> 1:21:18.120]  How many years would you say?
[1:21:18.120 --> 1:21:24.120]  If I was to give a number approximation, I would probably would say between four or five years.
[1:21:24.120 --> 1:21:26.120]  Or five years until what happened?
[1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:28.120]  Or seven years.
[1:21:28.120 --> 1:21:32.120]  But until things just start to fall apart.
[1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:35.120]  Now the Democrats want society to fall apart.
[1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:37.120]  That's why they don't discipline kids in school.
[1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:39.120]  It's why they're shipping in all the fentanyl.
[1:21:39.120 --> 1:21:42.120]  It's why they say the homeless can camp in your yard.
[1:21:42.120 --> 1:21:46.120]  Because if you read the cloud, heaven, plan and others, it's to collapse society.
[1:21:46.120 --> 1:21:52.120]  That's why Sanders is saying you deserve healthcare free, housing free, car free, don't have to work.
[1:21:52.120 --> 1:21:58.120]  They're all saying it because they want you to think that's how you get ahead is begging for freebies, putting them in power.
[1:21:58.120 --> 1:22:02.120]  All you're going to get is a forced labor camp like Venezuela right now.
[1:22:02.120 --> 1:22:07.120]  These people are so dumb, they won't know if they're successful in a few years by their starved to death.
[1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:09.120]  And how good they had it.
[1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:11.120]  They have no memories.
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:15.120]  Now she's coming up next segment, but first.
[1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:21.120]  There's been a phenomenon that I've noticed with my crew and people in other organizations and people that are activists.
[1:22:21.120 --> 1:22:28.120]  And just the general public with people that are concerned and involved and are empathetic and connected to God.
[1:22:28.120 --> 1:22:33.120]  Instead of people getting really excited that world government's coming out in the open, the pedophilia's out in the open,
[1:22:33.120 --> 1:22:40.120]  brain ships are out in the open, the anti-human, post-human agenda out in the open, Epstein out in the open,
[1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:44.120]  fluoride brain damaging human by design out in the open.
[1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:48.120]  You can read the books written by the Obama science are 45 years ago.
[1:22:48.120 --> 1:22:50.120]  Eco science.
[1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:53.120]  People before just thought, oh, it's not true.
[1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:56.120]  It's scaring people.
[1:22:56.120 --> 1:22:58.120]  And a lot of folks are getting depressed.
[1:22:58.120 --> 1:23:01.120]  I thought people would get excited when it all came out.
[1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:07.120]  We were proven right because then we can build opposition to this and stop it.
[1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:11.120]  But I guess some folks are so spectator-ish.
[1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:18.120]  Not my crew, but others that they think, oh my God, if it's all real, I better just not care.
[1:23:18.120 --> 1:23:21.120]  Or what are you going to do about it?
[1:23:21.120 --> 1:23:24.120]  Because more and more, it's like, okay, yeah, pedophiles run things.
[1:23:24.120 --> 1:23:25.120]  What are you going to do?
[1:23:25.120 --> 1:23:31.120]  Well, they're going to put a social score in and start taking everything you got if you don't let them bugger your kids.
[1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:34.120]  And a lot of you are going to go, well, I'll let them do that then.
[1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:38.120]  There is just a people rebel and being domesticated.
[1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:42.120]  And I never thought of myself as a tough, rugged guy.
[1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:44.120]  It's just instinctive to me to stand up for myself.
[1:23:44.120 --> 1:23:47.120]  But so many people think you get ahead by groveling.
[1:23:47.120 --> 1:23:49.120]  That was in the past.
[1:23:49.120 --> 1:23:51.120]  Things are now at the collapse level by design.
[1:23:51.120 --> 1:23:57.120]  You're going to get run over being a chicken neck.
[1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:03.120]  And so everybody needs to not make it work, but make it exciting, get in shape, get healthy, get focused, get engaged, get involved.
[1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:07.120]  Say no to the power structure.
[1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:11.120]  And really take action.
[1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:12.120]  There are a lot of ways to do that.
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:13.120]  But you know what?
[1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:14.120]  I'm going to be the leader I've been.
[1:24:14.120 --> 1:24:19.120]  I'm going to show you in the next few weeks and months what leadership is.
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:23.120]  I'm going to pull some legal, lawful stunts and I'm going to show you what you should do.
[1:24:23.120 --> 1:24:27.120]  Everybody's saying Bill Clinton's a rapist to his face and a chain reaction.
[1:24:27.120 --> 1:24:32.120]  They want us off the air because they fear the chain reaction.
[1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:36.120]  To quote something like Total Recall.
[1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:40.120]  Activate the reactor.
[1:24:40.120 --> 1:24:46.120]  And the reactor is your soul, your mind, you being set into motion.
[1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:51.120]  The thoughts, the ideas, the systems, the understanding, setting it in motion.
[1:24:51.120 --> 1:24:52.120]  Hit the dominoes.
[1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:53.120]  Set it in motion.
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:54.120]  We're going to do it.
[1:24:54.120 --> 1:24:58.120]  We've set the dominoes in motion so many times.
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:03.120]  And they don't want the blowback of killing me right away because they know that'll set some major stuff in motion.
[1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:05.120]  We're in a critical fight right now.
[1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:07.120]  We should all be extremely honored to be here.
[1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:09.120]  I'm extremely honored to be here now.
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:14.120]  I'm going to get to this more later, but let's just mention this now.
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:19.120]  What incredible footage came out on Friday was not in any mainstream news in the West that I saw.
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:22.120]  It was in Sky Television in England Saturday.
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:32.120]  Finally, it's the London Guardian today and a few U.S. publications, but infowars.com on Saturday.
[1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:40.120]  Shocking footage leaked from inside Chinese reeducation torture camps, a million man camp, and they're taking 600 people out to be executed.
[1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:41.120]  That's what it is.
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:47.120]  You might want to get that article and get it out to folks because empathy shows you need to be upset by that.
[1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:54.120]  But finally, the Guardian today, China footage reveals hundreds of blindfolded and shackled prisoners being led to their deaths, I should add.
[1:25:54.120 --> 1:26:00.120]  World's leading greenhouse gas cemetery in China refuses to make any carbon tax cuts and won't allow protest.
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:03.120]  Yeah, that's only to shut us down.
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:12.120]  Meanwhile, this footage, dramatic footage captures major Russian-China war games involving 120,000 troops.
[1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:17.120]  Basically, practicing a war with India is what it really is, even though Russia is working with India some.
[1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:23.120]  This is where the major flashpoints are between India, Pakistan, China, and the proxy war.
[1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:26.120]  Let's roll that video with audio.
[1:26:26.120 --> 1:26:28.120]  Radio listeners need to go to infowars.com.
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:31.120]  DrudgeReport.com is linked to it on the right-hand side.
[1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:34.120]  Dramatic footage captures major Russian-China war games.
[1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:35.120]  You'll want to see this.
[1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:37.120]  It looks like something out of Armageddon.
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:47.120]  Here it is.
[1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:48.120]  Look at those helicopters.
[1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:49.120]  Look at those jets.
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:50.120]  Look at all that.
[1:26:50.120 --> 1:26:55.120]  And that is what you'd imagine Armageddon would look like, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:26:55.120 --> 1:27:03.120]  On this footage again at DrudgeReport.com on the right-hand side.
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:10.120]  The senselessness of humanity fighting with itself, but that's the nature of it because there are always groups that want power.
[1:27:10.120 --> 1:27:22.120]  And there is a race towards quantum computing that's already here, a race towards AI, turning over our whole systems to a post-human system where humans are taken out of the control of civilization.
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:26.120]  And where the globalists that program it are the only ones that have power.
[1:27:26.120 --> 1:27:27.120]  Why are we going to let this be built?
[1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:28.120]  Why are we going along with this?
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:36.120]  We're going to come back and get into their plan to cut off the West Carbon and how we stop it and how they're getting even more hysterical and ridiculous.
[1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:37.120]  We have a lot of shocking footage.
[1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:42.120]  Some of the cars being blocked and people doing half-naked dances in front of families.
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:44.120]  We're going to show it all on how to left.
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:47.120]  Again, it's just flaunting its degeneracy.
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:50.120]  Please don't forget that I like to do things a little bit different.
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:57.120]  We are bringing Black Friday two months early and it's going to be a week-long store-wide free shipping.

[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:30.120]  These deals are insane.
[1:28:30.120 --> 1:28:33.120]  Some of these are at cost like the skin cream.
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:40.120]  It's amazing with all the hyaluronic acid, the vitamins, the minerals, and then the specially patented nano silver.

[1:29:51.120 --> 1:30:07.120]  Look, I'm not trying to discourage other best-selling bone broth formulas that sell for 35, 40, 50, 60 bucks retail that are discounted for like $39.95.
[1:30:07.120 --> 1:30:12.120]  But they don't have as much pure concentrated bone broth as we do.
[1:30:12.120 --> 1:30:14.120]  They don't have as much chocolate mushroom.
[1:30:14.120 --> 1:30:16.120]  They don't have as much bee pollen.
[1:30:16.120 --> 1:30:19.120]  They don't have as much of these amazing ingredients.
[1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:24.120]  And yes, we've gone out and just made a stronger version of other best-sellers.
[1:30:24.120 --> 1:30:25.120]  And it's selling out.

[1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:41.120]  But I want you to take advantage of this.
[1:31:41.120 --> 1:31:43.120]  We need funds to run our operations.
[1:31:43.120 --> 1:31:45.120]  So it is a win-win.
[1:31:45.120 --> 1:31:48.120]  We're going into 2020. M4war's needs the funds.
[1:31:48.120 --> 1:31:49.120]  Plus, these are great products.
[1:31:49.120 --> 1:31:56.120]  Go take advantage of them right now at M4warstore.com or M4war's Life.com or 888-253-3139.
[1:31:56.120 --> 1:32:00.120]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[1:32:00.120 --> 1:32:05.120]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at M4war's.
[1:32:05.120 --> 1:32:09.120]  And we are the individuals that have done the research to understand the Global Spattle Plan.
[1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:11.120]  And we know how to take them down.
[1:32:11.120 --> 1:32:13.120]  That's why they're so upset.
[1:32:13.120 --> 1:32:15.120]  Take how far we've come together.
[1:32:15.120 --> 1:32:18.120]  You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on
[1:32:18.120 --> 1:32:23.120]  because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order
[1:32:23.120 --> 1:32:27.120]  who've really taken the mask off, the lines in the sand for everybody now.
[1:32:27.120 --> 1:32:32.120]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[1:32:32.120 --> 1:32:35.120]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience
[1:32:35.120 --> 1:32:38.120]  because you are truly activist in the arena.
[1:32:38.120 --> 1:32:42.120]  And without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your financial support,
[1:32:42.120 --> 1:32:46.120]  this operation that you built, that your operation would not be here.
[1:32:46.120 --> 1:32:49.120]  We've got some giant specials running right now at M4warStore.com.

[1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:37.120]  Most of our crew here is actually out in the field or on air.
[1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:40.120]  And so we've got a real blind spot here.
[1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:42.120]  And this is not a negative thing I'm talking about on air.
[1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:44.120]  It's something listeners need to understand and know
[1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:47.120]  because you're just as important a part of the team as anybody here.
[1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:52.120]  This is not a spectator sport fighting globalism.
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:56.120]  I was talking to Savannah Hernandez sitting right next to me here in the studio of your radio listener.
[1:33:56.120 --> 1:34:01.120]  And she was like, have you seen Will Johnson's report when he went up to Chicago
[1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:09.120]  for the climate anti-human carbon tax shutdown American industry, but not Chinese industry, extravaganza?
[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:11.120]  And I said, no, I mean, he went hours live.
[1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:12.120]  I saw some of it.
[1:34:12.120 --> 1:34:17.120]  He's got all of them saying cut the human population, abort the babies.
[1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:19.120]  She's like, I'll find out the report.
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:20.120]  It's on M4.
[1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:21.120]  There's like three of them from him.
[1:34:21.120 --> 1:34:25.120]  And then she's like, oh, yeah, the report about to play is powerful, but I've got this report.
[1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:28.120]  And she starts telling me all this crazy stuff she's got.
[1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:31.120]  And the good news is people figured this out now.
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:37.120]  So Breitbart and Daily Caller and others, by the way, you're all welcome.
[1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:41.120]  In fact, you're even welcome to cover up the M4's logo and put your own thing on it.
[1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:42.120]  I don't care.
[1:34:42.120 --> 1:34:45.120]  You see, I want to just beat these people.
[1:34:45.120 --> 1:34:53.120]  They are getting Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett and Savannah Hernandez clips.
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:56.120]  And they are editing down like hour long streams.
[1:34:56.120 --> 1:34:57.120]  They do.
[1:34:57.120 --> 1:34:59.120]  And these things are getting 2 million, 5 million, 10 million views.
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:00.120]  And it's awesome.
[1:35:00.120 --> 1:35:01.120]  That's all I care about.
[1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:07.120]  And so I'm literally telling Daily Caller, I'm telling the Gateway Pundit, I'm telling
[1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:09.120]  you all just as long as you get their names right.
[1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:11.120]  And our bug in FullWars.com is on there.
[1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:15.120]  If you're afraid of getting censored because the bug is on there, cover it up.
[1:35:15.120 --> 1:35:16.120]  We don't care.
[1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:18.120]  They're saying they want to kill all the babies.
[1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:21.120]  They're killing babies after they're born.
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:25.120]  Now, Daily Caller is pretty good about wanting to spread their info, like with their Daily
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:26.120]  Caller News Foundation.
[1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:29.120]  And so is Breitbart's getting better about it.
[1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:31.120]  Some of the other folks, not so much.
[1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:33.120]  I mean, we try to promote people.
[1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:34.120]  We'll put like four paragraphs.
[1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:35.120]  They threaten to sue us.
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:36.120]  Fine.
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:38.120]  We're going to lose the whole country and the whole world like this.
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:42.120]  So I can't watch everything they're producing.
[1:35:42.120 --> 1:35:43.120]  There's so much of it.
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:48.120]  But we're trying to get more crew that can watch it and boil it down.
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:51.120]  I was in a meeting this morning with David Knight saying, your show's awesome.
[1:35:51.120 --> 1:35:52.120]  Three hours every morning.
[1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:56.120]  But we can't put, you know, all the clips up on InfoWars.
[1:35:56.120 --> 1:35:59.120]  We've got to, we've got to get the very best parts and promote those.
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:01.120]  But I'm asking listeners, go into David Knight's show.
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:02.120]  Find the best parts.
[1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:03.120]  Put it together yourself.
[1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:07.120]  Make a YouTube channel or go into my show and do it or go into the reports.
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:10.120]  That's putting out because they're just out there.
[1:36:10.120 --> 1:36:13.120]  And then a lot of times they do cut the reports down and we're going to play one in a moment.
[1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:16.120]  But it's just sensational stuff.
[1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:18.120]  You think the stuff the left used to say was crazy.
[1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:25.120]  We've got reporters in Europe, in England, in California, in Ohio, in New York, in Texas.
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:29.120]  I mean, I mean, I put a lot of money out here and I'm not bitching.
[1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:32.120]  We're kicking ass with our crew and your support.
[1:36:32.120 --> 1:36:40.120]  It's just that there's major frustration around here because they're blocking us everywhere.
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:42.120]  It's also sensational.
[1:36:42.120 --> 1:36:47.120]  What we've got to do is just put the clips concisely together and then get them out to everybody.
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:50.120]  And Drudge has really helped get a lot of the stuff out.
[1:36:50.120 --> 1:37:00.120]  But while I'm ranting here, Savannah will play these clips coming up next segment that you've got that others have gotten as well.
[1:37:00.120 --> 1:37:05.120]  I mean, some of the stuff I saw in Breitbart this morning with the left blocking traffic and screaming and yelling at people's cars
[1:37:05.120 --> 1:37:07.120]  and pulling their pants down on people.
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:11.120]  We're not going to show all that, but we're going to show some of the stuff that's somewhat family-friendly.
[1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:13.120]  I mean, I don't know what you took.
[1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:14.120]  They've gone completely insane.
[1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:17.120]  It's getting crazier and they don't want us to.
[1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:20.120]  On one side, Silicon Valley tries to cover it up.
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:22.120]  But on the other side, they're also flaunting.
[1:37:22.120 --> 1:37:24.120]  It's like schizophrenic.
[1:37:24.120 --> 1:37:25.120]  Definitely Alex.
[1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:29.120]  And Owen was the one that told me to go to this climate protest at the capital of Austin.
[1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:33.120]  And of course, we know that this is in response to the UN climate summit, which is actually happening today,
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:38.120]  which is why they're blocking traffic in DC, in New York, all over the country right now.
[1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:42.120]  And I went and again, we talk about this all the time, how they're attacking our children,
[1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:47.120]  how they're trying to scare our kids into being the ones that are promoting climate change, that are pushing climate change.
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:52.120]  So going there really put that into perspective and opened my eyes to the fact that that was really happening.
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:56.120]  My first report was titled, Students Admit Climate Change and Doctrination at Schools.
[1:37:56.120 --> 1:38:00.120]  I wanted to find out who's teaching kids about climate change.
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:02.120]  Where is this all starting at?
[1:38:02.120 --> 1:38:05.120]  And so I went and I asked them, you know, when did you first learn about this?
[1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:10.120]  And of course, they all said, oh, well, the first time I learned about this was at school, was in the sixth grade.
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:14.120]  My science teacher made me watch documentaries about how the ice caps are melting.
[1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:17.120]  And so we see that this, of course, starts at school.
[1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:19.120]  They're using the kids to push this narrative.
[1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:21.120]  And then I even interviewed several other people.
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:24.120]  They said that this is a fear-based movement.
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:26.120]  We want to scare people.
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:30.120]  Well, that's the big takeaway is you get them to say the world's gonna end in seven years, but really we're just trying to scare people.
[1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:38.120]  Well, we know that, but they're going in and brainwashing, traumatizing kids and then marching them out of school saying, be our puppets.
[1:38:38.120 --> 1:38:41.120]  I mean, this is the state-run system, literally kidnapping the kids.
[1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:48.120]  Right. And I think over the weekend, Scott Pressler actually, he went and picked up 50 tons of trash in Skid Row in Los Angeles.
[1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:55.120]  Meanwhile, Democrats, or many of our 2020 presidential Democrats, read a steak fry in Iowa.
[1:38:55.120 --> 1:39:00.120]  You know, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Andrew Yang, all of those candidates who are telling us, don't eat steak.
[1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:04.120]  Cows are contributing to climate change, the climate crisis.
[1:39:04.120 --> 1:39:06.120]  They were at a steak fry this past week.
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:09.120]  They're all flying around on private jets because it's not about stopping eating steak.
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:13.120]  It's about taking control of steak and everything else to put a tax on it they control.
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:15.120]  Right. We're not allowed to fly in planes.
[1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:17.120]  We're not allowed to eat certain things.
[1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:18.120]  We can't have our guns.
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:25.120]  And again, even going into that last week, we saw that Sandy Hook commercial that they put out, again, targeting our children, trying to scare kids.
[1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:26.120]  Terrorizing them.
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:29.120]  Exactly. So that's what all of these movements are about.
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:31.120]  We have all of these scientists and...
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:34.120]  And from Hitler to Mao, I mean, authoritarians always target kids.
[1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:37.120]  They get them while they're young, while they're not protected to brainwash them.
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:44.120]  Right. And I was even talking to Owen and I was telling him that when I was younger, I was terrified of climate change of the fact that we were all going to drown to death
[1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:47.120]  because I think you all remember in 2012, the world was supposed to end.
[1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:49.120]  They even came out with movies about it.
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:51.120]  So it's terrifying that we were all going to drown to death.
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:54.120]  And now that's being shown with our kids here today.
[1:39:54.120 --> 1:39:55.120]  They're all marching out of school.
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:39:57.120]  They are so afraid that we're going to burn to death.
[1:39:57.120 --> 1:39:58.120]  We're going to drown to death.
[1:39:58.120 --> 1:40:00.120]  And I think that was exemplified this past weekend.
[1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:05.120]  Greta Thunberg has come forward and she's the advocate for all of this.
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:10.120]  And a lot of the other kids that were there were saying she was their inspiration.
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:16.120]  And we're showing some of the footage of them dropping, blocking traffic.
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:21.120]  I mean, it's just, it's like a mental institution had its doors blown off and they escaped.
[1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:24.120]  Do you like how they're littering in that video, Alex?
[1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:28.120]  They're climate activists and they're throwing confetti on the street.
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:30.120]  So how is that supposed to help the earth?
[1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:33.120]  Well, it's all how they have the moral high ground.
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:35.120]  And then they're going to dictate to us how to live.
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:44.120]  This is just a cult of control freaks, but really they're just the mindless cannon fodder, mainly government workers and welfare folks that just spill on the street demanding free stuff.
[1:40:44.120 --> 1:40:48.120]  Right. And of course, everyone too uses the argument, well, we need to trust scientists.
[1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:50.120]  Scientists are the one telling us that this is happening.
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:57.120]  This is facts because science told us, well, these are the same scientists that have been proven wrong over the past 50 years.
[1:40:57.120 --> 1:41:02.120]  They've come out and said, ice caps are melting, polar bears are dying, penguins are dying, we're all going to burn to death.
[1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:05.120]  And we even have this article here by Breitbart.
[1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:08.120]  Climate experts are zero to 41 with their doomsday prediction.
[1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:10.120]  In fact, I've got that article too. Let's do this.
[1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:13.120]  Let's go over some of those and play a report when we come back.
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:19.120]  But why don't you just start now getting into some of the things they said that never came through.
[1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:21.120]  Read some of the Breitbart points they make.
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:25.120]  I mean, Al Gore said that by 2017, the ice caps will be completely melted.
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:26.120]  They're bigger than ever.
[1:41:26.120 --> 1:41:31.120]  Right. So back in 1975, there was a dire famine forecast.
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:35.120]  Everyone was supposed to disappear in a cloud of blue steam by 1989.
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:37.120]  Ice age by 2000.
[1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:43.120]  America subject to water rationing by 1974 and food rationing by 1980.
[1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:45.120]  Another ice age by 2020 or 2030.
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:47.120]  So I guess we only have one year left.
[1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:49.120]  Really, Alex, not 10 to 12.
[1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:51.120]  New ice age by 2070.
[1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:52.120]  Space satellites showed.
[1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:53.120]  Oh yeah, 22. I said it wrong.
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:57.120]  Climate genius Al Gore says ice free Arctic by 2013.
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:41:59.120]  Sorry, he said in 10 years in 2003.
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:00.120]  That's right.
[1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:01.120]  Right.
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:02.120]  Ozone depletion.
[1:42:02.120 --> 1:42:03.120]  Planet cooling.
[1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:04.120]  Acid rain.
[1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:06.120]  No one in site 30 year cooling trend.
[1:42:06.120 --> 1:42:08.120]  But now apparently it's getting hotter.
[1:42:08.120 --> 1:42:09.120]  Regional droughts.
[1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:13.120]  Temperature in DC will hit record high rising sea levels.
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:16.120]  Everything's supposed to be underwater apparently by 2019.
[1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:17.120]  That is New York City.
[1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:19.120]  What about 1966 oil gone in 10 years?
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:21.120]  Remember all the peak oil crap?
[1:42:21.120 --> 1:42:23.120]  Meanwhile, with the biggest export in the world, they're finding tons of it every day.
[1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:26.120]  The old oil wells are filling back up with oil.
[1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:27.120]  No one knows what's coming from.
[1:42:27.120 --> 1:42:28.120]  Right.
[1:42:28.120 --> 1:42:31.120]  All of these studies that are supposed to say that basically we shouldn't be here.
[1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:32.120]  We should all be dead.
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:33.120]  We should all be underwater.
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:35.120]  Well, how come none of that has happened yet?
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:36.120]  And every single time you ask these clients.
[1:42:36.120 --> 1:42:37.120]  Let's talk about why they're doing it.
[1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:38.120]  They don't know.
[1:42:38.120 --> 1:42:41.120]  So they can be the saviors and take full control of society and regulate and tax everything
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:43.120]  out of the sun, but they're all exempt from it.
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:47.120]  And we're going to play your powerful report where they admit their fear-mongering and
[1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:50.120]  scaring children on purpose to brainwash them.
[1:42:50.120 --> 1:42:52.120]  Stay with us in FullWars.com.

[1:42:56.120 --> 1:43:02.120]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental
[1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:04.120]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:09.120]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:14.120]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:16.120]  for their organs to be harvested.
[1:43:16.120 --> 1:43:20.120]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson at infowars.com.
[1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:25.120]  15 years ago that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:30.120]  do and hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues.
[1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:34.120]  Like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy
[1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:38.120]  that our government in Hollywood had been taken over by the Communist Chinese.
[1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:43.120]  On every one of these issues and many others, we've been dead on and we've raised the
[1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:45.120]  alarm on a planetary scale.
[1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:47.120]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:51.120]  And that's why you are more critical than ever to support the info war.
[1:43:51.120 --> 1:43:55.120]  Please support the info war however you can.
[1:44:21.120 --> 1:44:47.120]  We can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.

[1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:29.120]  But ashwagandha root, rhodiola root, passion flower herb, green tea leaf and licorice root

[1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:41.120]  But I want you to take advantage of this.
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:45.120]  We need funds to run our operations so it is a win-win.
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:47.120]  We're going into 2020.
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:48.120]  InfoWars needs the funds.
[1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:49.120]  Plus, these are great products.
[1:46:49.120 --> 1:47:18.120]  Go take advantage of them right now at infowarsstore.com or infowarslife.com or triple-82533139.
[1:47:19.120 --> 1:47:22.120]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central.
[1:47:22.120 --> 1:47:23.120]  I'm here live.
[1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:26.120]  Don't forget, David Knight's weekday mornings, 8 a.m. Central.
[1:47:26.120 --> 1:47:28.120]  The war room, Owen Schreuer.
[1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:29.120]  Three to six.
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:32.120]  We've got a show coming soon from six to seven.
[1:47:32.120 --> 1:47:35.120]  But right now, it's a retransmission of our My Broadcast then.
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:36.120]  Seven to nine.
[1:47:36.120 --> 1:47:38.120]  Will Johnson, Tom Papert, Firepower.
[1:47:38.120 --> 1:47:42.120]  Powerful, fast-moving transmission and more broadcasts and more shows coming.
[1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:45.120]  The Bissamel Cast on radio and TV.
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:46.120]  Not as internet.
[1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:51.120]  Glad I did that because when they black-balled me shadow band us and shot us down so many places,
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:55.120]  we still had AM and FM stations, Global Shortwave Satellite and TV.
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:47:56.120]  We've gained a lot of stations.
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:47:58.120]  I want to thank all those affiliates.
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:01.120]  Please be sure and support those local stations and spread the word about them.
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:02.120]  Become sponsors.
[1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:06.120]  Support their sponsors or tithe to the First Amendment and Truth and Justice.
[1:48:06.120 --> 1:48:14.120]  Most of your churches aren't speaking out against abortion or afterbirth abortion because they might get in trouble.
[1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:19.120]  But the local station is, well, that's a lot more for God and children than these fake churches are.
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:21.120]  So why don't you tithe to local stations?
[1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:24.120]  Whatever you do, spread the word and take action today.
[1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:27.120]  And we salute you because when you take action, the world changes.
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:29.120]  When you don't, well, the world's going to get a lot worse.
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:30.120]  So we know that.
[1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:34.120]  So please, without your action, we're going to slide into oblivion.
[1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:38.120]  If you fight back and take action, we've got a real fighting chance.
[1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:45.120]  And remember, I've decided to give you Black Friday-level deals, and these are really good Black Friday deals.
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:47.120]  A lot of Black Friday deals aren't good.
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:50.120]  They'll kind of raise prices and then cut them so it's not really cutting prices.
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:57.120]  These are real 50% off store-wide on all the supplements, water filtration, air filtration, storeable foods.
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:48:59.120]  That brings them right down close to cost.
[1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:04.120]  And free shipping and double-patria points as well on your next order.
[1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:08.120]  So all the best-selling items are there right now, and everybody needs Wake Up America coffee.
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:09.120]  It's excellent.
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:12.120]  Everybody needs fluoride-free, colloidal, silver iodine, fortified toothpaste.
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:13.120]  Super blue.
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:16.120]  Everybody needs turbo forest, rain forest.
[1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:17.120]  Everybody loves super metal vitality.
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:19.120]  There's literally hundreds and hundreds of great items.
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:21.120]  Emergency shortwave radios.
[1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:24.120]  It's all at mfoolwarstore.com.
[1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:27.120]  And again, sign up for auto-ship on things you want to reorder.
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:33.120]  So you get an additional 10% off as well, but then know each month you're supporting the transmission,
[1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:37.120]  canceled for free with one click anytime, whatever you do.
[1:49:37.120 --> 1:49:43.120]  Take action because we're expending all the funds coming in, going into 2020,
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:45.120]  and even going into reserves right now.
[1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:50.120]  And I just trust in God and I trust in you, but you are literally the wind in our sails.
[1:49:50.120 --> 1:49:53.120]  And you've seen how effective we are and how we're under attack.
[1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:58.120]  So without you taking action, without you financially supporting us and spreading the word like you continue to do,
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:49:59.120]  we will be shut down.
[1:49:59.120 --> 1:50:03.120]  This is a long-term battle of wills and I'm counting on you and I believe in you.
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:04.120]  So thank you for your support.
[1:50:04.120 --> 1:50:06.120]  Take advantage of Black Friday.
[1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:07.120]  Come early.
[1:50:07.120 --> 1:50:08.120]  We're running for at least a week.
[1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:09.120]  All supplies last.
[1:50:09.120 --> 1:50:12.120]  This is the biggest sale we've done since Christmas.
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:17.120]  Get into some more of those points before we get to your report of the excellent Breitbart article 41 times.
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:18.120]  They totally lied.
[1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:23.120]  Right, so normally halfway through here, we have, let's see, back in the 2000s,
[1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:30.120]  children won't know what snow is 2002 famine in 10 years if we don't give up eating fish, meat and dairy.
[1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:32.120]  Britain will be Siberia by 2024.
[1:50:32.120 --> 1:50:35.120]  Arctic will be ice free by 2018.
[1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:37.120]  So we're a year ahead of that.
[1:50:37.120 --> 1:50:41.120]  Climate genius Al Gore predicts ice free Arctic by 2013.
[1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:45.120]  UK Prime Minister says 50 days to save the planet from catastrophe.
[1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:50.120]  Al Gore moves 2013 prediction of ice free Arctic to 2014.
[1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:53.120]  And then it's moved to 2015.
[1:50:53.120 --> 1:51:04.120]  Only 500 days before climate chaos that was back in 2014 1968 over population will spread worldwide 1970 world will use up all its natural resources.
[1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:06.120]  1966 oil gone in 10 years.
[1:51:06.120 --> 1:51:10.120]  1972 oil depleted in 20 years.
[1:51:10.120 --> 1:51:21.120]  1977 Department of Energy says oil will peak in the 90s that's what you mentioned earlier Alex 1980 peak oil in 2000s 96 peak oil 2020 2002.
[1:51:21.120 --> 1:51:24.120]  And by the way, I got offered money by so called sponsors.
[1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:31.120]  If I would just push peak oil and all this and the Saudis are the funders of that because they don't want us doing exploration here.
[1:51:31.120 --> 1:51:36.120]  Just like China is one of the big funders of carbon taxes because they're not going to participate.
[1:51:36.120 --> 1:51:39.120]  Well, if their energies three times cheaper than ours, what's going to happen?
[1:51:39.120 --> 1:51:42.120]  Duh, everybody's going to move their their industry.
[1:51:42.120 --> 1:51:44.120]  It's sick.
[1:51:44.120 --> 1:51:45.120]  Right Alex.
[1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:47.120]  And okay, so we have what I think six more left.
[1:51:47.120 --> 1:51:56.120]  We are supposed to have super hurricanes that was in 2006 2005 Manhattan underwater by 2015 in the 70s urban citizens will require gas masks.
[1:51:56.120 --> 1:52:01.120]  Nitrogen buildup will make all land unusable decaying pollution will kill all the fish in 1970 killer bees.
[1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:09.120]  So that's the 41 list that they made on Breitbart of everything that was supposed to happen and none of it came true over the.
[1:52:09.120 --> 1:52:17.120]  And now we're hearing the same stuff from Beto and the same stuff from AOC and others that the world's going to end in 12 years 11 years seven years.
[1:52:17.120 --> 1:52:23.120]  They're all trying to top each other but you got a report you documented that they're doing this on purpose terrorizing the children.
[1:52:23.120 --> 1:52:27.120]  Tell us the audience what you said it was like when you were a little girl.
[1:52:27.120 --> 1:52:37.120]  Well and I was telling you this over the break that I was so scared when I was younger I would cry myself to sleep at night because I was terrified that the Arctic or whatever was going to end up melting.
[1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:44.120]  We're all going to flood no one was going to be able to live anywhere because the whole entire earth would be flooded and that's what I heard when I was a young kid.
[1:52:44.120 --> 1:52:52.120]  And now we're seeing videos of other children being used for this climate crisis you've seen the video clips of them crying about how we're all going to die.
[1:52:52.120 --> 1:52:56.120]  We're all going to burn to death we're all going to drown to death so this is something that's been happening for years.
[1:52:56.120 --> 1:53:02.120]  And they'll show a penguin on an ice flow that's where they hunt they'll show a polar bear on an ice flow that's where they hunt.
[1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:05.120]  Well actually these things get smaller in the summer bigger in the winter.
[1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:13.120]  They're literally terrorizing people and I know parents who say their daughters go to public school and come back crying because we're killing all the bunny rabbits.
[1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:25.120]  Exactly and National Geographic actually had to come out and admit they took a picture of this starving polar bear they said it was because of climate change and then they had to come out and admit actually the polar bear wasn't dying because of climate change.
[1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:27.120]  That was actually fake.
[1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:36.120]  So they've had to come out and admit this so many times before and again the climate activists try to say well scientists said and if you just use science you're you're crazy obviously.
[1:53:36.120 --> 1:53:40.120]  But the science shows there's five times the polar bears there were 60 70 years ago.
[1:53:40.120 --> 1:53:42.120]  Let's start getting your report right now.
[1:53:42.120 --> 1:53:43.120]  This is critical.
[1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:54.120]  It's up on info wars dot com right now with this headline that will show you as we go to break that the climate hysterics say the earth now only has seven years left.
[1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:57.120]  But admit it's all about scaring the children.
[1:53:57.120 --> 1:53:58.120]  There it is.
[1:53:58.120 --> 1:54:02.120]  Climate scientists say we only have seven years to live that admit it's using scare tactics.
[1:54:02.120 --> 1:54:03.120]  I was going from memory.
[1:54:03.120 --> 1:54:04.120]  He's to go mega viral.
[1:54:04.120 --> 1:54:07.120]  It's on info wars dot com from the great Savannah Hernandez and crew.
[1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:10.120]  Let's start playing some of the rest after break.
[1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:11.120]  Here it is.
[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:22.120]  I think that the part of it that is generational is that millennials and people and you know Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up.
[1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:28.120]  And we're like the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:31.120]  And so if we are going to confront any of these challenges.
[1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:42.120]  There's challenges to the economy or a system of health care or public education or confronting climate change before it is too late within the 10 years that we have left to us to act.
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:48.120]  Then the single greatest mechanism that humankind has ever devised to call forth the power of the people.
[1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:51.120]  A democracy must be fixed.
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:55.120]  So politicians have said that we have a matter of years left to be on the planet.
[1:54:55.120 --> 1:54:56.120]  What do you think about that?
[1:54:56.120 --> 1:54:57.120]  Do you think that projection is accurate?
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:00.120]  Do you think we have less than 10 to 12 years?
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:02.120]  I think that projection is accurate.
[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:11.120]  The one that I've heard the most often is that we have 80 years until if we don't do anything to stop it in 80 years there could be a mass extinction event.
[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:15.120]  And we only really recently have 10 to 12 years to stop it.
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:20.120]  I would say that that's probably accurate.
[1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:22.120]  Oh yeah, much less.
[1:55:22.120 --> 1:55:24.120]  How much less?
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:25.120]  Not 12 years.
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:28.120]  How many years would you save?
[1:55:28.120 --> 1:55:34.120]  If I was to give a number approximation I would probably would save between four or five years.
[1:55:34.120 --> 1:55:36.120]  Four or five years until what happened?
[1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:38.120]  Or seven years.
[1:55:38.120 --> 1:55:42.120]  But until things just start to fall apart.
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:44.120]  Drought.
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:48.120]  Cut down forests and crops.
[1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:50.120]  I think we have less time than that.
[1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:57.120]  But you got to understand politicians will have a seat at the table of survival because of the deals that they make right now.
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:55:59.120]  How many years left do you think you have?
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:01.120]  Well, it depends on where you're at.
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:11.120]  If you're in Detroit where it does not get very warm, you know, the seasons are, I would say you have 100 to 200 years left.
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:19.120]  If you live in Canada, like you might have 300 years left.
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:20.120]  This is the walking dead.
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:21.120]  But if you live in Florida.
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:23.120]  People are hopeless with moron followers.
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:29.120]  California or Mexico in general.
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:36.120]  Any, then you are going to.
[1:56:36.120 --> 1:56:38.120]  Like any place near the water?
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:40.120]  Any place near the equator.
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:43.120]  Yeah, on both sides of the equator, you are going to suffer.
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:45.120]  I think it's a possibility.
[1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:51.120]  I think some organizations are starting to help us make changes, but it's a lot slower than we would like it to be.
[1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:55.120]  I feel I think it's a possibility too.
[1:56:55.120 --> 1:57:02.120]  I know that already there are people who are dying from results of climate change around the world.
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:13.120]  And I think that if the patterns continue that it's totally plausible that 10 or 12 years that that could just be something that's like a mass killer of people.
[1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:14.120]  I really don't know.
[1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:17.120]  I don't think I know enough on like the on the matter.
[1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:20.120]  I don't know what like studies have been done or anything.
[1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:23.120]  We're going to go to the break and come back more with these idiots.
[1:57:23.120 --> 1:57:25.120]  They admit they're trying to scare people and come back.
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:26.120]  Look at these headlines.
[1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:33.120]  World's leading greenhouse gas-centered China taps out of global climate change, bans all protest, and it's cut zero carbon.
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:35.120]  That's only for you stupid Americans.
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:40.120]  Meanwhile in England, members of the government saying eating meat should be banned like smoking, says top barrister.
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:57.120]  He calls for a new crime of ecocide.

[1:58:49.120 --> 1:58:58.120]  God bless you. I have an idea for a new Infowars t-shirt. Instead of this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[1:58:58.120 --> 1:58:59.120]  Oh, yeah.
[1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:02.120]  Showing your brain, getting fried. Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[1:59:02.120 --> 1:59:20.120]  Pull the chain of my life. I use turbo force, bodies, alpha power, brain force, fish oil, ultra-twelve, daily, X2 every several days. Now, what I've found is really combining them is totally synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products, and I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them.
[1:59:20.120 --> 1:59:21.120]  I just want to say why not.
[1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:31.120]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the Coke U10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[1:59:31.120 --> 1:59:38.120]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body. You take these bases together, then you have your foundation, now you can build the big, strong temple.
[1:59:38.120 --> 2:00:05.120]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better, and then it funds the information war, which is so critical. Thank you so much. God bless you.
[2:00:08.120 --> 2:00:26.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live broadcasting worldwide. We have Joel Scowze in the World Affairs Brief, a really smart guy.
[2:00:26.120 --> 2:00:40.120]  His view on the geopolitical machinations with Iran, Saudi Arabia, the carbon taxes, globalism, all in the next segment. But Savannah Hernandez, infowars.com, Intrepid Reporter is going through a report she filed in Austin, Texas, where they say the world ends in seven years.
[2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:51.120]  We're really doing it just to scare people. The video is up on infowars.com. Please spread it, like any key intel, because they're brainwashing these kids and terrorizing them. Let's go back to that report.
[2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:56.120]  So how did it come to those conclusions? I don't know what I could say really.
[2:00:56.120 --> 2:01:07.120]  I know Beto O'Rourke came forward, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, they said we had about 10 to 12 years to fix things before. I'm not sure if either we all die or if it's irreversible. What do you guys think about all of those comments?
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:27.120]  I think it's that amount of time until it's irreversible, but once it's irreversible, we're kind of done for. There's nothing else we can do. It's kind of scare tactics sometimes, but you kind of have to scare people to jumpstart them to do anything about it, because like she said, there is data to back it up about the way things are headed.
[2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:46.120]  I mean it is about fear and whether it's happening, whether those things are going to happen in a matter of years or a matter of millions of years, it's going to happen eventually. So if we can scare people into making a difference now and save that for even later then.
[2:01:46.120 --> 2:01:57.120]  What would you say to the people who say that climate change activists are just really extreme or overly exaggerated, saying that we're either going to burn to death or that the earth is going to flood? What would you say to that?
[2:01:57.120 --> 2:02:11.120]  I think that honestly, yes, there are some extremes in climate change, but I think that we need those extremes because we have such, especially in politicians, no one's really doing anything, so I think we have to have those extremes to have something happen.
[2:02:11.120 --> 2:02:24.120]  A lot of the times I've read news stories about how climate activists are over-exaggerated by saying we're either going to burn up or I guess drown to death. What do you guys think about those claims? What do you guys think about those news stories that try to debunk climate change?
[2:02:24.120 --> 2:02:32.120]  Well, I think we have to pay attention to scientists. Science tells us that this is a real issue and we need to pay attention and take action.
[2:02:32.120 --> 2:02:44.120]  There's no over-exaggeration. Many of our biggest cities are in low-lying areas that would be completely flooded if the sea level rose even just a few feet and it will if we do nothing.
[2:02:44.120 --> 2:02:59.120]  Honestly, I'm not sure. I think it would be more plausible for it to be a bit more slow and a bit less sung, understated than us just burning to death, but we will die, I'm sure of it.
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:07.120]  Well folks, we heard a lot of facts and statistics today and well f*** it, we're going to die. This has been Savannah Hernandez with Action 7 News.
[2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:19.120]  These people are a death cult and they just hand over their whole lives to people. Meanwhile, you have a 2003 Al Gore says all the coastlines, everything will be flooded by 2013 and then none of it happens.
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:28.120]  The ice caps will all be melted, none of it happens. Then Obama buys a $14 million mansion right on the water and Martha's vineyard and these people, you go to them and you go, here's hundreds of times they lied.
[2:03:28.120 --> 2:03:39.120]  They go, I don't want to see that. It's all true. We're all dead. They just like to get into hysteria and then sign over their power to some world government where China puts out all this dirty energy.
[2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:43.120]  Ours is clean and you talk to them and they just go shut up racist.
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:49.120]  Right. And those two women actually that said, oh, this is a fear-based movement. We need to scare people into taking action.
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:59.120]  I actually brought up the famine forecast from 1975. I said, this didn't actually happen. Do you think it's right to scare children using these statistics, these facts?
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:10.120]  And they were saying, well, we need to scare people into taking action. We need to be extreme about it because if we're not, if we don't scare people, if we don't invoke fear into people, no one's going to do anything.
[2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:16.120]  So as we can see, the scientists are using a lot of the fake statistics. They're just trying to scare us into following what they want.
[2:04:16.120 --> 2:04:24.120]  Closing, as they get more hysterical, I'm going to ask Joel that's coming up, people aren't believing anymore. I mean, they're just going crazy.
[2:04:24.120 --> 2:04:30.120]  Right. And I think that goes into all of our politicians. You know, they get so extreme that people just start waking up to it.
[2:04:30.120 --> 2:04:39.120]  And that's what we can hope for this as well is that people just start waking up to it and realizing that it's not as extreme as all these fake scientists and all these fake statistics are making it safe.
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:46.120]  Well, in fact, it's the opposite of what they're saying when you carbon dioxide really bad. Well, he reports up on newswords.com. Can't wait to see what you do next.
[2:04:46.120 --> 2:05:15.120]  We're developing a whole show for you if you'll do it. Savannah Hernandez. She's awesome. We'll be back with Joel Scalzen. Stay with us.
[2:05:16.120 --> 2:05:26.120]  It's now live. Band.video. Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson band videos.
[2:05:26.120 --> 2:05:44.120]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted and where a growing list of freedom loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum and the globalist.
[2:05:44.120 --> 2:05:55.120]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band.video. America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[2:05:55.120 --> 2:06:15.120]  Band.video.
[2:06:15.120 --> 2:06:25.120]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:25.120 --> 2:06:45.120]  Bill Scalzen is a former marine aviator, Vietnam era. He's an author. He's one of the top recognized experts on safe places around the world, not just the U.S. And he's also authored a lot of bestselling books on that side that you sell the books and a boil down film of it.
[2:06:45.120 --> 2:07:14.120]  The world war store.com is main site. World of First Brief. World of First Brief..com. He's with us for the balance of the hour and I want to cover the waterfront here with him, the huge crisis with one half of Saudi Arabia's oil production knocked out one fifth of the world's supply proxy armies, India going into cashmere, these giant Russian Chinese drills that are going on.
[2:07:14.120 --> 2:07:19.160]  major geopolitical movements taking place. Looks like BB Netanyahu is going to be taken
[2:07:19.160 --> 2:07:23.320]  out of power with this new coalition government. He's hanging on by his fingernails, but the
[2:07:23.320 --> 2:07:28.380]  word is he's about to be gone. What does all this symbolize? Why are the Democrats killing
[2:07:28.380 --> 2:07:36.600]  so insane? What are they going to pull out of their hat? They usually pull a false flag.
[2:07:36.600 --> 2:07:46.000]  There's just so much to cover here today with Joel Scousen. So let's dive in first to the
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:53.240]  flashpoint in the Strait of Hormuz and in the Middle East with what's really going on
[2:07:53.240 --> 2:07:59.000]  because we've seen freighters grabbed. We've seen sanctions increased. We've seen cruise
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:03.720]  missiles blow up. Again, these wall refineries. We have the rebels take credit, but then the
[2:08:03.720 --> 2:08:07.880]  U.S. says it was fired out of Iran. Well, Joel Scousen is an expert on a lot of these,
[2:08:07.880 --> 2:08:12.560]  so he can bring his wide range of knowledge together and give us his best approximation
[2:08:12.560 --> 2:08:16.520]  of exactly what's going on here. Joel, thanks for joining us.
[2:08:16.520 --> 2:08:22.360]  Thank you very much, Alex. The attack on the refinery inside the radio was a very, very
[2:08:22.360 --> 2:08:33.480]  sophisticated false flag. I believe they piggybacked on top of a Houthi drone attack, but the damage
[2:08:33.480 --> 2:08:39.720]  to the various spherical gas containment tanks could not have been done by any of the weapons
[2:08:39.720 --> 2:08:47.040]  that they claim Iran has or have showcased as exploded ordnance, which there's no proof
[2:08:47.040 --> 2:08:52.240]  that they were exploded ordnance from that area. What you have here, you have 14 spherical
[2:08:52.240 --> 2:08:58.400]  tanks over here in exactly the same place on every single tank. I mean, that is super
[2:08:58.400 --> 2:09:05.800]  precision, and none of those tanks exploded, Alex. I know of no weapons other than depleted
[2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:12.160]  uranium rounds that can enter a tank and not explode it. And in order to even do that,
[2:09:12.160 --> 2:09:18.480]  because a depleted uranium round will create a tremendous amount of heat and sparks, and
[2:09:18.480 --> 2:09:24.400]  they would have ignited the gas too unless those tanks were empty and purged before that.
[2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:29.920]  In other words, the only fires that you see here, and they only lasted a few hours instead
[2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:35.680]  of days at a normal refinery fire, those were where pipeline areas were hit, probably by
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:42.560]  the Houthi drone attacks with explosive warheads. But what's interesting is the spherical tanks
[2:09:42.560 --> 2:09:48.280]  that were hit supposedly full of gas should have exploded, even if you hit with a direct
[2:09:48.280 --> 2:09:51.920]  round, but it certainly couldn't have been hit with a cruise missile, which has an explosive
[2:09:51.920 --> 2:09:55.960]  warhead, couldn't have been hit with any kind of missile with an explosive warhead and not
[2:09:55.960 --> 2:10:02.440]  exploded. Even if the tanks were empty, those tanks themselves would have exploded with
[2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:08.280]  an explosive warhead. So it had to be depleted uranium rounds. That means either the U.S.,
[2:10:08.280 --> 2:10:13.280]  Russia, or China provided the ammunition for that attack, and Israel is the most likely
[2:10:13.280 --> 2:10:17.440]  candidate for having done that false flag attack.
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:22.200]  There's another piece of evidence too. The U.S. says that Iran did this, and you've got
[2:10:22.200 --> 2:10:26.800]  a picture up there right now of those tanks that were not exploded. They all have a hole
[2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:35.560]  in it, about a foot in diameter, but no explosion. I mean, this is impossible with today's ordnance
[2:10:35.560 --> 2:10:40.760]  unless those tanks were empty. But in any case, if those attacks came from Iran, they
[2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:46.240]  would have had to overfly all the U.S. naval assets in the Persian Gulf that have Aegis
[2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:54.920]  radars. Kuwait and Bahrain have major long-range radar. The U.S. has produced no radar tapes
[2:10:54.920 --> 2:11:01.600]  showing those assets, missiles, cruise missiles, or drones coming from Iran. And the reason
[2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:06.600]  they can't show the radar tapes is they don't exist. And there's no way that the U.S. could
[2:11:06.600 --> 2:11:11.280]  have missed that attack coming, which means that they could have warned Saudi Arabia.
[2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:18.360]  The entire purpose of these U.S. assets, or one of the three purposes, is to safeguard
[2:11:18.360 --> 2:11:23.880]  Saudi Arabia's oil supply. And so what I'm saying is that there's no way it could have
[2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:29.640]  come from Iran. I think it had to be special weapons. Those tanks had to be empty, which
[2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:35.760]  means that Saudi Arabia had to be part of the collusion of letting their own oil refinery
[2:11:35.760 --> 2:11:39.920]  go down. And it's not going to be down for six months or a year. They now say it's going
[2:11:39.920 --> 2:11:44.880]  to be back up and operational in a year. I mean, I'm sorry, in a month. And that's because
[2:11:44.880 --> 2:11:49.760]  you see those holes in those tanks have already been cut out. They're rewielding planks into
[2:11:49.760 --> 2:11:54.680]  those tanks going to be operational within a couple of weeks. And the rest of the refinery
[2:11:54.680 --> 2:11:59.360]  just has holes in it, very, very little destruction. This refinery going to be up and running in
[2:11:59.360 --> 2:12:04.520]  a month. So this was not an attack by Iran. This had to be a sophisticated false flag
[2:12:04.520 --> 2:12:09.120]  attack where they piggybacked on a Houthi attack. And the Houthis have every reason
[2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:13.760]  to be attacking Saudi Arabia. They've been under attack from Saudi Arabia for many, many
[2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:20.000]  years and killing thousands of civilians. And so, yeah, there's a good picture of that
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  hole in the tank right now. That could not have been done by an explosive warhead.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:30.720]  So what was it done by then, like an armor piercing larger round?
[2:12:30.720 --> 2:12:36.080]  No armor piercing is explosive as well. This had to be depleted uranium. And the tank had
[2:12:36.080 --> 2:12:39.720]  to be empty. That's what I'm saying. Well, you're right. I mean, a lot of armor piercing
[2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:45.440]  does have the insinuary inside of it, a little explosive. Yeah. Yeah. So let me ask you this.
[2:12:45.440 --> 2:12:49.720]  What about all the photos that are identified and look similar to Iranian drones? Are you
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:54.160]  saying a third party country like Israel would actually cook up even the fake drones that
[2:12:54.160 --> 2:13:00.800]  look Iranian? No, no. The Iran is supplying drones to the Houthis. And so the Houthis
[2:13:00.800 --> 2:13:05.680]  claim credit for this. They were using Iranian drones. So it's just like the U.S. supplying
[2:13:05.680 --> 2:13:10.200]  weapons to everyone around the world, and someone doesn't attack with U.S. weapons.
[2:13:10.200 --> 2:13:15.280]  You blame the United States? Well, indirectly for supplying the weapons. And we've proven,
[2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:20.960]  and I've had the information in the World Affairs Brief from Diliana Geitancheva, the
[2:13:20.960 --> 2:13:27.800]  Bulgarian journalist documenting how all of these weapons depots in ISIS are U.S. weapons.
[2:13:27.800 --> 2:13:30.360]  And you can trace their serial numbers back to U.S.
[2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:35.840]  Oh, absolutely. Obama let them all in. And of course, you and I, back three years ago,
[2:13:35.840 --> 2:13:40.160]  two years ago, when there were all these attacks, we said it was false flags because the ISIS
[2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:44.760]  and Al Qaeda folks, Al-Nazra, shot videos celebrating because they wanted to be rock stars back
[2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:50.000]  home. But our media blamed Assad. It later came out that indeed those were false flags.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:54.200]  And then we got internal documents that Google sought to censor by myself and Dr. Ron Paul.
[2:13:54.200 --> 2:13:58.760]  I don't know if you saw this, Scousen, but some of your stuff was mentioned, too, in
[2:13:58.760 --> 2:14:01.560]  the reports. That's why they wanted us off air, because they were worried when there
[2:14:01.560 --> 2:14:05.360]  were future false flags that we would question it.
[2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:10.040]  Yeah, we have good reason to question. As I said, there's just no way that Iran could
[2:14:10.040 --> 2:14:15.440]  have done this without the U.S. tracking and warning Saudi Arabia. How come the defense
[2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:23.760]  system was shut down? They've got Hawk missile bases around the, they've got missile systems.
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:27.520]  Right. Even 30-year-old systems should be able to shoot these down. They have advanced
[2:14:27.520 --> 2:14:30.680]  systems, correct? That's correct. They have advanced systems.
[2:14:30.680 --> 2:14:37.480]  They have Hawk systems. They have French systems, which aren't that good. But they are still,
[2:14:37.480 --> 2:14:44.440]  you know, usable for these things. I mean, there was nothing shot at any of these drones
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:51.440]  or missiles coming in. But I can tell you that if any attacks occurred from the Houthis,
[2:14:51.440 --> 2:14:55.880]  they occurred at those elements where there were fires. But those attacks on those spherical
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:15:02.080]  gas tanks were not by Houthi drones. So what type of DU round would that be? I mean, the
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:09.400]  Abrams is too large, Sebo. What would it be? Well, I mean, it's probably a 20-millimeter,
[2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:17.080]  even a 20-millimeter depleted uranium round would make a foothold in a tank like that.
[2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:21.520]  But it's not an explosive order. An explosive order, but a torn-net tank, completely pieces.
[2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:24.600]  There wouldn't have been anything left of those tanks with any kind of explosive warheads.
[2:15:24.600 --> 2:15:27.800]  Again, I'm not a military guy, but if I was going to be shooting oil tanks, I would use
[2:15:27.800 --> 2:15:31.880]  an incendiary round or a armor piercing that goes through and explodes.
[2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:35.920]  Yeah. I mean, any regular explosive round, not even armor piercing, would have gone
[2:15:35.920 --> 2:15:40.600]  through those tanks. I mean, those tanks have 3-eighths in steel, walls on it. Anything
[2:15:40.600 --> 2:15:44.840]  can penetrate that, especially an explosive. Well, let's talk about geopolitics. Let's
[2:15:44.840 --> 2:15:48.200]  talk about why Trump's not attacking Iran. Does he know he's being set up? Because what
[2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:51.640]  you said is actually what I believe happened is that this is like another Bay of Pigs that
[2:15:51.640 --> 2:15:57.360]  was set Trump up. Let's talk about it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll

[2:19:57.760 --> 2:20:04.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:04.760 --> 2:20:21.840]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:21.840 --> 2:20:29.320]  I don't think there's any doubt that we're in a major crossroads in human destiny. There's
[2:20:29.320 --> 2:20:34.720]  so many incredible developments happening. Evil's really coming out of the closet right
[2:20:34.720 --> 2:20:38.440]  now. We'll talk about that next segment, which old scouts in the editor world, the
[2:20:38.440 --> 2:20:46.800]  first brief.com. And we're also going to get into some of the other societal decalice
[2:20:46.800 --> 2:20:52.600]  taking place. But when I looked at this, you had the Israeli election coming up. You've
[2:20:52.600 --> 2:20:56.160]  got Trump saying he wants to meet with the Iranian leaders and try to end the sanctions
[2:20:56.160 --> 2:20:59.360]  and have a peace deal. You know, they've been sabotaging his attempted peace deals in North
[2:20:59.360 --> 2:21:05.000]  Korea as well. And I know that you have shadow diplomacy by Obama and Hillary in the deep
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:09.600]  state. And then they have their own deep state in Iran. And some evidence shows the CIA helped
[2:21:09.600 --> 2:21:13.720]  put them in in 79. So I'm thinking, are they doing this with plausible denonability using
[2:21:13.720 --> 2:21:19.840]  the rebels as cover to say, to embarrass Trump and to get him to strike for some setup? Or
[2:21:19.840 --> 2:21:25.840]  would it be another place like Israel or factions of Israel wanting something for an election?
[2:21:25.840 --> 2:21:30.240]  And they're tracking an attack that already comes in from the rebels, who we know of attack
[2:21:30.240 --> 2:21:35.240]  Riyadh with missiles and things before. So they piggyback on it. I mean, I agree with
[2:21:35.240 --> 2:21:40.200]  Joel Scalsum, but he was a Marine Corps aviator in Vietnam. He knows about these weapons systems.
[2:21:40.200 --> 2:21:44.520]  These do look more sophisticated, more targeted. They're very precise, kind of like the Star
[2:21:44.520 --> 2:21:49.240]  Wars analogy. They look at the Sandcrawler and I've never seen sand people hit something
[2:21:49.240 --> 2:21:53.920]  this big. And Obi-Wan Kenobi says, we were only meant to think they hit this Imperial
[2:21:53.920 --> 2:21:57.800]  Stormtroopers that only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise. So there's your cheesy Star
[2:21:57.800 --> 2:22:02.160]  Wars analogy. So I think that is the big telltale here. I agree with him. We have the aerial
[2:22:02.160 --> 2:22:10.160]  photos. It's very precision. And why was there a stand down? But then Iran, they're
[2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:13.320]  not. I mean, I would address those moodles as far as I could throw them either. They've
[2:22:13.320 --> 2:22:19.400]  been under sanctions a long time. They had been grabbing ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[2:22:19.400 --> 2:22:23.720]  So Joel, I mean, of all those competing theories, I think what comes out of it here is we're
[2:22:23.720 --> 2:22:28.680]  not getting the full story. And I think that Trump is holding back because I think he realizes
[2:22:28.680 --> 2:22:33.600]  this could be like Bay of Pigs and to embarrass Kennedy. But this could be like 1979 with
[2:22:33.600 --> 2:22:40.760]  the Delta Force failed to raid into Iran for the hostages as well. What do you think?
[2:22:40.760 --> 2:22:46.400]  Well, I don't think Trump has a great deal of understanding about the false intelligences
[2:22:46.400 --> 2:22:52.240]  getting from the agencies. The mainstream media, including Fox News, continues to push
[2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:56.360]  home. You got to believe our intelligence professionals. We've got to believe them.
[2:22:56.360 --> 2:23:01.520]  And Trump seems to believe them. But in spite of the false intelligence that he's getting,
[2:23:01.520 --> 2:23:05.120]  because of his previous campaign promises to end the war and to understand and get out
[2:23:05.120 --> 2:23:10.560]  of these foreign wars, he is very reluctant to do this. And the intelligence community
[2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:16.800]  or the national security agency is supposed to give him options. And he's rejecting
[2:23:16.800 --> 2:23:22.680]  all the options except for sanctions. That's the only thing. He says, let's increase sanctions,
[2:23:22.680 --> 2:23:28.320]  which clearly showed I'm not going to attack right now. Now, they keep throwing other false
[2:23:28.320 --> 2:23:35.120]  flag attacks. I mean, the shoot down of the drone was a provocation. The bigger provocation
[2:23:35.120 --> 2:23:42.040]  initially on Iran was sending a P8 with 35 crew members into Iranian territory and get
[2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:46.800]  him to shoot down American soldiers. That would have brought war. And Iran said, no,
[2:23:46.800 --> 2:23:51.400]  we're going to shoot the drone down, which was there to photograph the P8 and its destruction.
[2:23:51.400 --> 2:23:55.920]  They shot down the drone and left the P8 alone. And Trump appreciated that, the fact that
[2:23:55.920 --> 2:24:02.120]  they didn't do that. So, you know, I don't like the molas. I don't like Iranians' restriction
[2:24:02.120 --> 2:24:11.640]  of liberty on people. But Iran is not the biggest terrorist sponsor of the world. The
[2:24:11.640 --> 2:24:17.040]  United States' deep state is, along with Israel and Saudi Arabia. And it's important
[2:24:17.040 --> 2:24:22.960]  to notice that the mainstream media continues to hype and bring out this paradigm, or I'm
[2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:28.400]  not saying paradigm, but the standard story. For example, every time you hear about Iran,
[2:24:28.400 --> 2:24:32.640]  you hear this standard response, the biggest sponsor of terror in the world. It's just
[2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:39.320]  impossible. Iran is, in fact, sponsoring all of the fighters against U.S. back terror.
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:41.400]  And that's why the globalists want to take down Iran.
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:46.120]  And let's explain that. That's the whole project going on for decades with Saudi Arabia, with
[2:24:46.120 --> 2:24:50.280]  the Mujahideen, starting the fight with Russia. I mean, give people some background on that,
[2:24:50.280 --> 2:24:53.560]  because that's an admitted fact. When Trump was on the campaign, he's saying Hillary and
[2:24:53.560 --> 2:24:56.560]  Obama are the founders of ISIS. They really are.
[2:24:56.560 --> 2:25:03.040]  Yeah, but he didn't understand what I'm saying. He only meant by the Iran agreement that they
[2:25:03.040 --> 2:25:11.920]  were, or know by, what he meant by, in Syria, by being permissive, by not allowing us to
[2:25:11.920 --> 2:25:16.400]  go in and attack, that they allowed ISIS to grow. That's what Trump meant. And that is
[2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:22.800]  stupid. It was a direct creation. The U.S. deep state took 50% of the U.S.-backed terrorists
[2:25:22.800 --> 2:25:27.960]  in Syria and said, you're now called ISIS. It was just a name change. We'll give you
[2:25:27.960 --> 2:25:32.560]  a priority on weapons. They had three big weapons depot established in the last...
[2:25:32.560 --> 2:25:37.000]  True. That's all admitted fact. And Senator Paul and Senator Cruz did talk about that,
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:43.200]  though. But expanding on that, then, what do you expect to happen next, seeing all these
[2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:45.080]  things develop?
[2:25:45.080 --> 2:25:50.720]  Well, the goblins are not going to back down from fighting Iran, because, as I said, Iran
[2:25:50.720 --> 2:25:57.880]  is the only direct opponent, other than the Russians in Syria, which aren't doing very
[2:25:57.880 --> 2:26:02.040]  much right now. But Iran is the only direct opponent of the U.S.-backed war on terror.
[2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:06.160]  And it's not just Syrian-backed rebels, which there is no difference between those... There
[2:26:06.160 --> 2:26:10.840]  are no moderates in Syria. They're all just like ISIS. And that's why you can separate...
[2:26:10.840 --> 2:26:15.040]  They call them by different names. But I'm convinced that Israel trains most of those
[2:26:15.040 --> 2:26:20.760]  terrorist leaders. They are the best at infiltrating Arab and Muslim countries. They use Israeli
[2:26:20.760 --> 2:26:26.240]  Arabs that are part of Israel, bring them into the IDF, and train them to run terrorism
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:31.280]  and other things. So the normal terrorists around Syria and Iraq, et cetera, don't know
[2:26:31.280 --> 2:26:35.480]  that they're being run by the United States, other than the fact that their weapons depots
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:36.480]  are full of U.S.
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:41.320]  I understand on that, because you can pull up UPI and AP reports from the mid-90s admitting
[2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:47.040]  that one Israeli government founded Hamas as a counterbalance to Hezbollah. And so
[2:26:47.040 --> 2:26:51.800]  explain to people, because the main move in doing all this is to drive a fisher and cause
[2:26:51.800 --> 2:26:57.040]  a civil war between Shiite and Sunni, and then use the threat of terror as a pretext
[2:26:57.040 --> 2:26:59.320]  for Western expansion in the Middle East.
[2:26:59.320 --> 2:27:05.840]  Well, first of all, I want to correct one. It's not that Israel creates Hamas, or that
[2:27:05.840 --> 2:27:11.080]  they created Yasser Arafat in a Palestinian liberation organization, but they did help
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:17.640]  fund it. And that's just like the globalist helping to fund and allow Russia and China
[2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:22.400]  to steal military technology. It's not that they control them. It's not that they're running
[2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:23.400]  those two countries.
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:26.800]  Well, I'm not saying they command the whole thing, but that was the headline, was at its
[2:27:26.800 --> 2:27:35.560]  very inception, there was Western funding into it to create a counterbalance against
[2:27:35.560 --> 2:27:36.560]  Hezbollah.
[2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:40.760]  Right. But it wasn't direct funding. It always comes through surrogates, so that it's not
[2:27:40.760 --> 2:27:45.440]  obvious that the U.S. otherwise they would be suspicious, because Hamas hates the United
[2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:51.000]  States. It's the Great Satan. And so it's all through sub-tribuge. I mean, that's why
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:56.520]  the U.S. deep state, when they're funneling weapons to Syria, they use cutouts, they use
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:02.280]  a black dealer, weapons dealers, they use silkway airline under diplomatic cover to
[2:28:02.280 --> 2:28:07.080]  bring in these weapons. And they go through several, several chains of command until they
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:10.880]  get to the rebels themselves. And the rebels, of course, think we just stole this stuff
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:14.840]  from the Americans. They don't really know that their operations would be run at the
[2:28:14.840 --> 2:28:15.840]  highest level.
[2:28:15.840 --> 2:28:19.880]  Sharon, remember a few years ago, ISIS even had to put videos out saying, we don't really
[2:28:19.880 --> 2:28:23.600]  work with the West. Don't believe that because they were so upset about you, myself, Ron
[2:28:23.600 --> 2:28:25.400]  Paul and others exposing that.
[2:28:25.400 --> 2:28:29.680]  Yeah, I mean, it was so obvious. You know, all those orange jumpsuits, where did they
[2:28:29.680 --> 2:28:34.480]  get those? The hundred Toyota trucks that came from U.S. requisition orders, where did
[2:28:34.480 --> 2:28:39.880]  they get those? I mean, this is clearly a U.S. operation. And no terrorist organizations
[2:28:39.880 --> 2:28:43.320]  are trying to control the world goes around to...
[2:28:43.320 --> 2:28:47.520]  Well, let's talk about this when we come back, because what does the system really think
[2:28:47.520 --> 2:28:50.880]  of Trump? Who do you think he really is? What do you think is coming next? With those scouts,
[2:28:50.880 --> 2:28:53.560]  let's stay with us.
[2:28:53.560 --> 2:28:58.480]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know
[2:28:58.480 --> 2:29:03.680]  me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little
[2:29:03.680 --> 2:29:10.000]  too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life. I realized I needed help to
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:15.280]  fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and
[2:29:15.280 --> 2:29:20.680]  drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment
[2:29:20.680 --> 2:29:26.000]  Advisors. They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:31.520]  habits and totally change your life. And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the
[2:29:31.520 --> 2:29:38.120]  entire program may be covered. Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse. Get clean.

[2:29:52.200 --> 2:29:59.640]  Alex. Yes. I got a plug for the Patriot points I get. Oh, thanks. I got $180 so far this
[2:29:59.640 --> 2:30:03.760]  year and I feel like I'm stealing from you. I buy so much in the store because, I mean,
[2:30:03.760 --> 2:30:06.120]  I don't want to give that money to Walmart. I don't want to give that money to people
[2:30:06.120 --> 2:30:09.320]  who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in. So I'd rather give that money
[2:30:09.320 --> 2:30:12.880]  to you. And I'm getting quality products. The products that I do receive have changed
[2:30:12.880 --> 2:30:17.160]  my life. I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me. I've lost weight. My brain works
[2:30:17.160 --> 2:30:21.560]  a whole lot better. My kids, they use the toothpaste. My son used to get these little
[2:30:21.560 --> 2:30:25.560]  sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat.
[2:30:25.560 --> 2:30:29.160]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you. I want high quality stuff in there. I want
[2:30:29.160 --> 2:30:34.000]  a good price. But I've kind of obituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:38.040]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off. And so it's the same thing like the fish oil
[2:30:38.040 --> 2:30:42.200]  or the turmeric or the bone broth. Thank you so much for the plugs. But listen, when people
[2:30:42.200 --> 2:30:45.920]  get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later because if you're
[2:30:45.920 --> 2:30:49.920]  already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, then we're doing 50% off. And then
[2:30:49.920 --> 2:30:53.560]  you do something like that. We have Patriot points. We lose money, but that's okay. Thanks
[2:30:53.560 --> 2:30:58.520]  for the support. September is almost over. And right now we're offering store wide free
[2:30:58.520 --> 2:31:04.840]  shipping, double Patriot points and 50% off for a limited time. As a lot of you know, I
[2:31:04.840 --> 2:31:09.840]  don't play by the establishment's rules. In fact, I like to hijack things they've created
[2:31:09.840 --> 2:31:14.000]  and turn it towards the use of the people and the information war. And we're doing that
[2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:19.280]  right now with the big game changer. We're going to bring you real Black Friday prices
[2:31:19.280 --> 2:31:25.560]  months early in late September and early October. It's going to run as long as supplies last
[2:31:25.560 --> 2:31:32.800]  across the board, at least 50% off, store wide, free shipping, double Patriot points
[2:31:32.800 --> 2:31:38.440]  and more. We've not done this, ladies and gentlemen, since last Christmas. But I want
[2:31:38.440 --> 2:31:43.480]  you to take advantage of this. We need funds to run our operations. So it is a win win.
[2:31:43.480 --> 2:31:47.680]  We're going into 2020. Info Wars needs the funds. Plus, these are great products. Go
[2:31:47.680 --> 2:31:52.200]  take advantage of them right now at info wars store.com or info wars life.com or triple
[2:31:52.200 --> 2:31:57.800]  eight to five, three, three, one, three, nine.

[2:33:34.960 --> 2:33:38.880]  the eight pack power stack AMP impact to take all your vitamins and minerals and more at
[2:33:38.880 --> 2:33:43.040]  one time, all of this funds the resistance to globalists. They really want to shut us
[2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:47.120]  down for a good reason because we're not controlled and we're governed by the truth
[2:33:47.120 --> 2:33:51.280]  and trying to really get at the truth, not the false disinformation.
[2:33:51.280 --> 2:33:56.280]  But you know, after we get more into the geopolitics with Iran, with Joe Scals, and only going
[2:33:56.280 --> 2:34:02.160]  to China, as I see it being our main opposition, of course, get the globalists here running
[2:34:02.160 --> 2:34:06.640]  us in a moment and all the footage coming out of their torture camps and the rest of
[2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:12.680]  it. And, you know, really how we're seeing Chinese style censorship come here to America.
[2:34:12.680 --> 2:34:18.240]  But first, let's let's hear from this little piece that triggers leftist. Here it is.
[2:34:18.240 --> 2:34:41.600]  We are working with Sherlock Holmes Valley to make you behave yourself. Once we have full
[2:34:41.600 --> 2:34:47.600]  control, we send you to reeducation camp like we do our people when they talk back to the
[2:34:47.600 --> 2:34:57.680]  party. Whatever you do, do not visit band.video. Band.video is evil Americans who Sherlock
[2:34:57.680 --> 2:35:10.680]  Holmes Valley is teaching to shut up like China glass. I just caught you, American.
[2:35:10.680 --> 2:35:18.960]  You visited band.video. Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you. Do what CNN says
[2:35:18.960 --> 2:35:25.240]  and do not visit band.video. Oh, I have to hurt your ass.
[2:35:25.240 --> 2:35:30.680]  Joe Scals is always so serious. Hey, Joe, what do you think of that?
[2:35:30.680 --> 2:35:36.040]  Brilliant. I'm glad to see you come up with band.video. There's got to be some alternative
[2:35:36.040 --> 2:35:40.880]  to YouTube that allows the truth to come out without being censored.
[2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:44.920]  Well, you're welcome to have a dial in and a channel on it. We're going to expand it
[2:35:44.920 --> 2:35:50.720]  to, you know, folks that do great work like you do to be providers. And so anything goes
[2:35:50.720 --> 2:35:55.040]  as long as we know the folks are good and have a great history like you do. Getting back
[2:35:55.040 --> 2:35:59.840]  to the serious issues, though, part of me wants to keep supporting Trump at every level
[2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:03.680]  because a lot of the good things he's doing, the global is clearly upset at him and don't
[2:36:03.680 --> 2:36:07.800]  run him. I think that's the main issue they have with him. And he's fighting the fentanyl
[2:36:07.800 --> 2:36:13.080]  and he's, you know, trying to help the border some second amendment. He's been a lot better
[2:36:13.080 --> 2:36:20.240]  than Hillary, but not standing up to the censorship yet. He keeps promising years and just letting
[2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:24.960]  all of this happen, shifting years into Trump and just the state of the country right now
[2:36:24.960 --> 2:36:31.360]  and 2020 and what you think's coming next year because things are already crazy.
[2:36:31.360 --> 2:36:38.360]  Well, Trump continues to baffle his globalist advisors. He doesn't have the background that
[2:36:38.360 --> 2:36:42.240]  I want him to have about the deep state and about controlling terror. He doesn't know
[2:36:42.240 --> 2:36:48.760]  when he's being lied to, but he does have these instincts which occasionally, you know,
[2:36:48.760 --> 2:36:54.560]  want to take out of Afghanistan or take the troops out of Afghanistan. I think, for example,
[2:36:54.560 --> 2:36:59.120]  that they pulled, the U.S. intelligence pulled a false flag in that terrorist attack that
[2:36:59.120 --> 2:37:04.160]  came out while the Taliban were negotiating with Donald Trump. There's no way the Taliban
[2:37:04.160 --> 2:37:09.360]  leadership would have scheduled a terror attack during those negotiations when they're so
[2:37:09.360 --> 2:37:13.800]  close to getting 5,000 troops more out of Afghanistan.
[2:37:13.800 --> 2:37:17.480]  But the Taliban, people have to understand, and I cover this in the World Affairs Brief,
[2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:23.040]  is composed of a lot of separate groups, none of which were controlled by a central hierarchy.
[2:37:23.040 --> 2:37:29.600]  And so it's very, very easy for the U.S. with their Israeli-trained ISIS people to infiltrate
[2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:34.280]  one of those groups and pull off a terrorist attack and then to claim credit for it in
[2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:40.120]  the name of the Taliban. And, you know, the Taliban isn't going to disavow that necessarily
[2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:46.720]  because they are made up of very disparate groups. But I just think it's like the Iranians
[2:37:46.720 --> 2:37:53.720]  capturing a tanker that is flagged in Japan when Prime Minister Abe was there negotiating
[2:37:53.720 --> 2:37:58.160]  peace with Iran. That's just impossible to happen. Nobody in the right mind would do
[2:37:58.160 --> 2:37:59.160]  that.
[2:37:59.160 --> 2:38:03.400]  And so these are false flag attacks that are happening to sabotage. But Donald Trump doesn't
[2:38:03.400 --> 2:38:07.840]  know any of that. He doesn't ever see any of that. He's only guided by those instincts,
[2:38:07.840 --> 2:38:13.400]  and they are normally turned around eventually by another false flag. I'm frankly surprised,
[2:38:13.400 --> 2:38:21.160]  Alex, that this false flag attack on or this piggyback false flag attack on the Arabian
[2:38:21.160 --> 2:38:26.080]  oil didn't get Trump to attack. But it didn't. And I'm pleased with that.
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:32.040]  But I'm afraid I don't have any confidence in him doing anything consistently that is
[2:38:32.040 --> 2:38:37.680]  going to stop the deep state. Now, the one thing that is positive is that he did not
[2:38:37.680 --> 2:38:44.400]  pick a globalist for the new national security advisor. Robert O'Brien is not a good conservative
[2:38:44.400 --> 2:38:49.400]  in the sense that he doesn't know about the deep state. He's a people pleaser like Mitt
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:55.400]  Romney, but he is a faithful Mormon. He doesn't have any vices. He doesn't have a corruption
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:39:00.960]  thing, which is on the mark that everybody in the deep state has to be corrupt to a high
[2:39:00.960 --> 2:39:05.920]  degree in order to have blackmail on them. So he is a deep state. But unfortunately,
[2:39:05.920 --> 2:39:10.440]  he's not going to do anything but take, I mean, he's going to be a believer in the false
[2:39:10.440 --> 2:39:16.760]  intelligence that comes from all the CIA briefings, just like Mitt Romney would be. But at least
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:21.240]  he's not knowing deep state. So he's not going to be pushing Donald Trump into doing
[2:39:21.240 --> 2:39:24.080]  something like John Bolton would have done.
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:27.720]  And I think that's what Trump said. Trump said, I'm sick of Herman Bolton, as to say,
[2:39:27.720 --> 2:39:31.680]  has terrible ideas, and was basically trying to bully Trump, as what I'm told. So Trump's
[2:39:31.680 --> 2:39:37.280]  gotten somebody that'll do what he says, instead of being a being the deep state neocons puppets.
[2:39:37.280 --> 2:39:41.400]  The system's got to be frustrated with Trump right now, obviously unable to removing the
[2:39:41.400 --> 2:39:46.520]  rusticates falling apart. This new Ukraine thing blew back onto them. But they're not
[2:39:46.520 --> 2:39:47.520]  going to give up.
[2:39:47.520 --> 2:39:51.960]  No, absolutely not. They're not going to give up on the attack on Iran. You're going to
[2:39:51.960 --> 2:39:56.920]  see more false flags. I think what they're looking for the next false flag though has
[2:39:56.920 --> 2:40:02.840]  to be enough to hurt American civilians or military. And I think that's what will tip
[2:40:02.840 --> 2:40:08.240]  Trump over the edge on that.
[2:40:08.240 --> 2:40:15.680]  Trump is, unfortunately, using tariffs in his war with China on this. And tariffs are
[2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:22.240]  a mixed bag. In fact, he's compromised a lot on the tariffs. Big Silicon Valley complained
[2:40:22.240 --> 2:40:28.200]  about the tariffs on computers as they backed off on those particular tariffs. In fact,
[2:40:28.200 --> 2:40:32.520]  one of the most conservative U.S. senators was Senator Mike Lee from Utah. In the past
[2:40:32.520 --> 2:40:40.360]  three or four months, he's been bought out by big tech in Silicon Valley, offering unlimited
[2:40:40.360 --> 2:40:47.360]  green cards for people from India and not taking on Google in terms of censorship. I'm
[2:40:47.360 --> 2:40:52.240]  very, very saddened with what's happened to Mike Lee. Ron, Rand Paul seems to be the only
[2:40:52.240 --> 2:40:55.440]  money who seems to be holding the line.
[2:40:55.440 --> 2:40:59.800]  It's really amazing when we read the Google documents that came out last year. Anybody
[2:40:59.800 --> 2:41:03.800]  can pull these up. Google paid grip to deal with them for worse. But when you read the
[2:41:03.800 --> 2:41:09.720]  documents, it says, and by the way, some of these, you're mentioned, that, well, he has
[2:41:09.720 --> 2:41:14.000]  Ron Paul on, he's covering this and they're, you know, and then these people are talking
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:17.640]  about how these are false flags. And they're so upset that we're just here pointing out
[2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:22.480]  that a lot of this stuff ends up to be staged. And it really shows how the power structure
[2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:26.680]  is not all powerful. They thought Hillary was going to be in. Trump got in. But I think
[2:41:26.680 --> 2:41:31.720]  that's a fluke. If Trump doesn't take major action against election fraud and other issues,
[2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:34.520]  I think they're going to steal the election from Trump. And then I think they're going
[2:41:34.520 --> 2:41:39.440]  to really pull something big to try to sew up the country and shut down the populist movement
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:41.400]  that got Trump in. What do you think?
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:47.120]  Well, I, that's been my philosophy all along. They've got to get rid of Trump. But you know,
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:51.920]  it's interesting that Hillary says, you know, the election was stolen from me. But in fact,
[2:41:51.920 --> 2:41:59.080]  Trump won in spite of the democratic process of stealing votes by the kinds of registrations
[2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:05.000]  that they do and the computerized vote switching that goes on. There's been not a single example
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  of computerized vote switching in favor of Donald Trump. Nothing. It's only been in favor
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:17.280]  of Hillary. And it's still going on. It came out in that Southern race. It was a primary
[2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:20.920]  for the Republicans when the switched a vote for the conservatives.
[2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:23.240]  Oh, it's just constant. It's constant.
[2:42:23.240 --> 2:42:27.240]  And he got it on video. And so, you know, they said, well, we can fix this. Well, look,
[2:42:27.240 --> 2:42:31.880]  you don't fix it. This is not a computer air. Computers can't make these kinds of things.
[2:42:31.880 --> 2:42:35.040]  So it's being pre-programmed in. We'll be right back with Joe Scow. The World of First
[2:42:35.040 --> 2:42:40.320]  Reef.com. I want to shift gears into moral decline with him. Remember Jocelyn Elder saying
[2:42:40.320 --> 2:42:46.600]  great sound of the children help them play with their weenies. Well, I'm not kidding.
[2:42:46.600 --> 2:42:49.720]  That's now happening in schools. What do we do about this at this point? There's got to
[2:42:49.720 --> 2:42:54.320]  be a line of the sand. People need to be indicted.
[2:42:54.320 --> 2:43:00.120]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has their
[2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:04.560]  products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[2:43:04.560 --> 2:43:07.640]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two
[2:43:07.640 --> 2:43:14.120]  years as a seller. We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically
[2:43:14.120 --> 2:43:19.000]  mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:24.920]  silver salt technology in it. It's got the hyaluronic acid. It's got the steric acid.
[2:43:24.920 --> 2:43:30.720]  It's got the grapefruit essential oil. It's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much
[2:43:30.720 --> 2:43:36.640]  more. It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.
[2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:39.360]  You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere. You're certainly not going
[2:43:39.360 --> 2:43:45.440]  to find it at this price and it funds the info war at infowarslife.com. Get your super
[2:43:45.440 --> 2:43:50.800]  silver skin cream today. We can only run this special for another week or so as I'm taping
[2:43:50.800 --> 2:44:00.800]  this September 10th.
[2:44:00.800 --> 2:44:24.800]  We have full control. We send you to re-education camp like we do our people when they talk
[2:44:24.800 --> 2:44:49.920]  to us.
[2:44:54.800 --> 2:44:58.080]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor,
[2:44:58.080 --> 2:44:59.960]  but I still need my morning coffee.
[2:45:00.980 --> 2:45:02.980]  And luckily, our break room
[2:45:02.980 --> 2:45:04.720]  at the Info Wars headquarters
[2:45:04.720 --> 2:45:06.720]  is stocked full of high-quality
[2:45:06.720 --> 2:45:10.380]  Info Wars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[2:45:10.380 --> 2:45:13.020]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[2:45:13.020 --> 2:45:18.020]  the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee
[2:45:18.400 --> 2:45:22.000]  at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[2:45:27.160 --> 2:45:29.040]  There has never been a more important time
[2:45:29.040 --> 2:45:31.240]  to support Info Wars.
[2:45:31.240 --> 2:45:32.960]  So if you love coffee,

[2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:51.920]  at infowarstore.com.
[2:45:54.280 --> 2:45:56.120]  September is almost over,

[2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:03.120]  double Patriot points, and 50% off for a limited time.
[2:46:03.120 --> 2:46:04.240]  As a lot of you know,
[2:46:04.240 --> 2:46:06.360]  I don't play by the establishment's rules.
[2:46:06.360 --> 2:46:09.440]  In fact, I like to hijack things they've created
[2:46:09.440 --> 2:46:11.600]  and turn it towards the use of the people
[2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:12.880]  and the information war.
[2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:15.400]  And we're doing that right now with a big game changer.
[2:46:15.400 --> 2:46:18.920]  We're gonna bring you real Black Friday prices.
[2:46:18.920 --> 2:46:22.280]  Months early in late September and early October.
[2:46:22.280 --> 2:46:26.520]  It's gonna run as long as supplies last across the board,
[2:46:26.520 --> 2:46:30.560]  at least 50% off, store-wide, free shipping,
[2:46:30.560 --> 2:46:33.080]  double Patriot points, and more.
[2:46:33.080 --> 2:46:35.120]  We've not done this, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:46:35.120 --> 2:46:36.920]  since last Christmas.
[2:46:36.920 --> 2:46:39.560]  But I want you to take advantage of this.
[2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:43.000]  We need funds to run our operations, so it is a win-win.
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:45.800]  We're going into 2020, Info Wars needs the funds.
[2:46:45.800 --> 2:46:47.200]  Plus, these are great products.
[2:46:47.200 --> 2:46:48.720]  Go take advantage of them right now.
[2:46:48.720 --> 2:46:51.480]  At infowarsstore.com, or infowarslife.com,
[2:46:51.480 --> 2:46:53.800]  or triple-eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:46:57.600 --> 2:47:00.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:47:05.920 --> 2:47:08.920]  ["Info Wars"]
[2:47:08.920 --> 2:47:12.920]  ["Info Wars"]
[2:47:14.920 --> 2:47:20.920]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:20.920 --> 2:47:23.920]  All right, Joe Scowles and World First Brief.com is our guest.
[2:47:23.920 --> 2:47:28.920]  You go to dredgereport.com, Trump the Invincible.
[2:47:28.920 --> 2:47:31.920]  And you've got the Washington Post saying his reaction
[2:47:31.920 --> 2:47:34.920]  to the whole Ukraine situation, saying they better watch out
[2:47:34.920 --> 2:47:36.920]  that all the dirt's on their side,
[2:47:36.920 --> 2:47:39.920]  shows that he thinks he's invincible.
[2:47:39.920 --> 2:47:41.920]  I wouldn't call it invincibility.
[2:47:41.920 --> 2:47:43.920]  I mean, it's the Clintons that helped overthrow
[2:47:43.920 --> 2:47:46.920]  that place and cause with Obama, the Civil War.
[2:47:46.920 --> 2:47:48.920]  It's the State Department. It's George Soros.
[2:47:48.920 --> 2:47:50.920]  And they're the ones that gave their families
[2:47:50.920 --> 2:47:53.920]  all these sweetheart deals, like Joe Biden's son.
[2:47:53.920 --> 2:47:55.920]  He's the one.
[2:47:55.920 --> 2:47:58.920]  And so, like Trump said, I'm not going to be recorded on the phone
[2:47:58.920 --> 2:48:01.920]  telling somebody to do something or we'll do sanctions.
[2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:02.920]  This is all lies.
[2:48:02.920 --> 2:48:05.920]  And the whistleblowers, third party, didn't hear this themselves.
[2:48:05.920 --> 2:48:07.920]  So it's more of this Kavanaugh stuff,
[2:48:07.920 --> 2:48:10.920]  where they know people aren't buying into this Kavanaugh.
[2:48:10.920 --> 2:48:12.920]  And now two more of the women came out, as you know,
[2:48:12.920 --> 2:48:15.920]  Joel last week and said, we were never even contacted.
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:17.920]  I never even knew Kavanaugh. This is just made up.
[2:48:17.920 --> 2:48:21.920]  So they're so reckless now, they just don't seem to care.
[2:48:21.920 --> 2:48:23.920]  It's like they've gone crazy.
[2:48:23.920 --> 2:48:25.920]  What do you think's really going on here?
[2:48:25.920 --> 2:48:28.920]  And what do you make of the Washington Post
[2:48:28.920 --> 2:48:30.920]  trying to say Trump thinks he's invincible?
[2:48:30.920 --> 2:48:33.920]  Why should he even buy into this, like the whole fake Russiagate thing?
[2:48:33.920 --> 2:48:35.920]  I mean, I think that's the right response to say,
[2:48:35.920 --> 2:48:38.920]  this is ridiculous crap. What do you think?
[2:48:38.920 --> 2:48:41.920]  Well, it is dangerous to flatter Donald Trump.
[2:48:41.920 --> 2:48:43.920]  He's very subject to flattery.
[2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:45.920]  When you tell him that he's invincible, he loves it.
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:47.920]  He'd love to believe that.
[2:48:47.920 --> 2:48:50.920]  But what it does, it's an attempt to make him less careful
[2:48:50.920 --> 2:48:52.920]  so that he makes even more mistakes.
[2:48:52.920 --> 2:48:54.920]  I think that's what they're trying to lure him into.
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:48:57.920]  But you know, the Democrats are so over the top
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:01.920]  in these just literally insane proposals,
[2:49:01.920 --> 2:49:04.920]  giving benefits to everyone, free education, free medical care,
[2:49:04.920 --> 2:49:09.920]  Medicare for all, $93 trillion for this and that, climate change.
[2:49:09.920 --> 2:49:13.920]  I was nauseous almost listening to those high school students
[2:49:13.920 --> 2:49:18.920]  that your girl interviewed how stupid they are,
[2:49:18.920 --> 2:49:21.920]  just parroting things without any facts,
[2:49:21.920 --> 2:49:25.920]  talking about we're going to die and that those cities are going to flood.
[2:49:25.920 --> 2:49:28.920]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[2:49:28.920 --> 2:49:32.920]  And it's not going to happen any more than the melting in the ice caps,
[2:49:32.920 --> 2:49:34.920]  revelations wouldn't happen.
[2:49:34.920 --> 2:49:37.920]  And when you tell them Obama just bought a house on the beach,
[2:49:37.920 --> 2:49:39.920]  or that all Al Gore's predictions were lies,
[2:49:39.920 --> 2:49:42.920]  or that they make money off the carbon tax, they go, shut up.
[2:49:42.920 --> 2:49:45.920]  That's right wing lies when it's all admitted fact.
[2:49:45.920 --> 2:49:47.920]  Yeah, but you know, we're suffering,
[2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:51.920]  and this is one of the long term problems that I really worry about.
[2:49:51.920 --> 2:49:56.920]  You know, the public education propaganda is finally coming home to roost.
[2:49:56.920 --> 2:50:00.920]  I mean, when conservative Brigham Young University has 30% of students
[2:50:00.920 --> 2:50:02.920]  vote for Hillary Clinton in the last election,
[2:50:02.920 --> 2:50:06.920]  that was unheard of in the days when I went to Brigham Young University.
[2:50:06.920 --> 2:50:09.920]  And that shows how, you know, it's having its impact.
[2:50:09.920 --> 2:50:11.920]  These millennials are coming into college,
[2:50:11.920 --> 2:50:14.920]  they're bringing these idiotic ideas,
[2:50:14.920 --> 2:50:16.920]  and they're just repeating and parroting what...
[2:50:16.920 --> 2:50:22.920]  50% say that they support communism.
[2:50:22.920 --> 2:50:25.920]  Yeah, and they really don't know anything about the history of communism.
[2:50:25.920 --> 2:50:30.920]  They've been shielded from the history of Joseph Stalin and all of those.
[2:50:30.920 --> 2:50:33.920]  And we're dealing with a more sophisticated form of socialism
[2:50:33.920 --> 2:50:34.920]  called Fabian socialism.
[2:50:34.920 --> 2:50:36.920]  We have private property, they tell you you're free,
[2:50:36.920 --> 2:50:38.920]  but we control you.
[2:50:38.920 --> 2:50:40.920]  You know, we have regulations for everything,
[2:50:40.920 --> 2:50:42.920]  and that's why Britain wanted out of the EU,
[2:50:42.920 --> 2:50:44.920]  and why they're not letting them out of the EU.
[2:50:44.920 --> 2:50:46.920]  They keep sabotaging them.
[2:50:46.920 --> 2:50:50.920]  But in the long term, my geopolitical view is that, you know, the big threat,
[2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:55.920]  everything's going to still keep going more or less fat, dumb, and happy
[2:50:55.920 --> 2:50:59.920]  for the West until this big World War III comes with Russia and China.
[2:50:59.920 --> 2:51:01.920]  And they are going...
[2:51:01.920 --> 2:51:02.920]  That was my next question.
[2:51:02.920 --> 2:51:03.920]  You just read my mind.
[2:51:03.920 --> 2:51:07.920]  dredgerport.com is linked to our article that has the dramatic footage.
[2:51:07.920 --> 2:51:11.920]  Dramatic footage captures major Russia-China war games
[2:51:11.920 --> 2:51:14.920]  involving over 120,000-k soldiers.
[2:51:14.920 --> 2:51:16.920]  What do you make of India going into Kashmir
[2:51:16.920 --> 2:51:19.920]  and the situation in Hong Kong and Taiwan?
[2:51:19.920 --> 2:51:22.920]  I mean, are these not proxy wars?
[2:51:22.920 --> 2:51:24.920]  Well, yes and no.
[2:51:24.920 --> 2:51:28.920]  For example, Hong Kong is a Tiananmen Square waiting to happen,
[2:51:28.920 --> 2:51:35.920]  but China is so worried about, you know, coming up with another bashing Tiananmen Square
[2:51:35.920 --> 2:51:38.920]  where they kill thousands of people and they tried to cover it up.
[2:51:38.920 --> 2:51:41.920]  You know, China said there was no man standing in front of the tank.
[2:51:41.920 --> 2:51:43.920]  There was nobody killed at Tiananmen Square.
[2:51:43.920 --> 2:51:45.920]  It was just an outright lie.
[2:51:45.920 --> 2:51:50.920]  But they're desperate. They know because of, you know,
[2:51:50.920 --> 2:51:53.920]  frontline documentary on Tiananmen Square and things that the word is out.
[2:51:53.920 --> 2:51:55.920]  They really did kill a lot of people.
[2:51:55.920 --> 2:51:58.920]  They've got a lot of troops stationed around Hong Kong.
[2:51:58.920 --> 2:52:03.920]  And Hong Kong protesters are not backing down with the puppet government
[2:52:03.920 --> 2:52:09.920]  in Hong Kong giving in and saying that...
[2:52:09.920 --> 2:52:10.920]  What is that?
[2:52:10.920 --> 2:52:14.920]  Well, they're saying that they're going to not now extradite people to the mainland without charges.
[2:52:14.920 --> 2:52:17.920]  The extradition law has been...
[2:52:17.920 --> 2:52:19.920]  But, you know, they can bring it right back up immediately.
[2:52:19.920 --> 2:52:22.920]  They want a permanent guarantee there's going to be no extradition.
[2:52:22.920 --> 2:52:28.920]  They've put in prison and arrested some of the old grandfatherly type people that are in the protests.
[2:52:28.920 --> 2:52:32.920]  Absolutely. I mean, we see people fighting for freedom in the East,
[2:52:32.920 --> 2:52:36.920]  but then people not fighting for it here in America because, as you said,
[2:52:36.920 --> 2:52:40.920]  we've been free so long we have no idea what we're even facing.
[2:52:40.920 --> 2:52:43.920]  It's almost like Native Americans who had no immunity to smallpox and it killed them all.
[2:52:43.920 --> 2:52:46.920]  We just haven't been around this type of tyranny in so long that we don't know what it's like.
[2:52:46.920 --> 2:52:49.920]  But those right under its shadow are fighting so valiantly.
[2:52:49.920 --> 2:52:53.920]  And even the New York Times, as you I'm sure know, has been praising Mao Zedong.
[2:52:53.920 --> 2:52:57.920]  And now they spray paint on the walls in Austin.
[2:52:57.920 --> 2:52:59.920]  China is going to defeat Trump.
[2:52:59.920 --> 2:53:01.920]  And even the Washington Post says, you know,
[2:53:01.920 --> 2:53:03.920]  Gee, please crush Trump.
[2:53:03.920 --> 2:53:05.920]  I mean, that's the words. Defeat him. Crush him.
[2:53:05.920 --> 2:53:07.920]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[2:53:07.920 --> 2:53:14.920]  Well, they've been propagandized. They just don't have any basis of knowledge for this stuff that they're saying.
[2:53:14.920 --> 2:53:18.920]  They're pro-socialists because they don't understand the concept of hidden victims.
[2:53:18.920 --> 2:53:22.920]  Socialism always have hidden victims. Regulations always have hidden victims.
[2:53:22.920 --> 2:53:26.920]  Well, yeah, where's all the free money going to come from people that don't want to work?
[2:53:26.920 --> 2:53:29.920]  Yeah. And so it's very serious.
[2:53:29.920 --> 2:53:35.920]  But I think the major threat to us, the globalists are smart enough to keep everyone pretty fat, dumb and happy.
[2:53:35.920 --> 2:53:38.920]  That's why there's not going to be a collapse of the economy.
[2:53:38.920 --> 2:53:41.920]  There's going to be perhaps in a correction in the stock market,
[2:53:41.920 --> 2:53:45.920]  which is overblown to help bring down Trump in the next election.
[2:53:45.920 --> 2:53:50.920]  But the big problem comes in World War III when we're going to absorb a nuclear first strike.
[2:53:50.920 --> 2:53:55.920]  Our military is going to be decapitated and our leaders are going to come out of their bunkers and say,
[2:53:55.920 --> 2:53:57.920]  We didn't know this was happening.
[2:53:57.920 --> 2:54:02.920]  But the only way we can defend ourselves now is to join in a militarized global government with taxing power
[2:54:02.920 --> 2:54:06.920]  and all the things that the Britons, you know, doesn't want out of the EU.
[2:54:06.920 --> 2:54:10.920]  Just like everyone in World War II were engineered to bring in the League of Nations and UN.
[2:54:10.920 --> 2:54:11.920]  That is their plan.
[2:54:11.920 --> 2:54:14.920]  We'll talk about that again at a future date with Joel Scousen here.
[2:54:14.920 --> 2:54:17.920]  I meant to get to this, but let's cover it briefly now.
[2:54:17.920 --> 2:54:22.920]  As you know, Jocelyn Elders famously as the Surgeon General got fired for saying,
[2:54:22.920 --> 2:54:25.920]  we're going to help the children, the teachers are going to masturbate the children.
[2:54:25.920 --> 2:54:27.920]  I hate to talk about that on air, but this is going on.
[2:54:27.920 --> 2:54:35.920]  Daily Mail article children as young as six are to be given compulsory self-touching lessons by the schools.
[2:54:35.920 --> 2:54:37.920]  And now they're bringing it to the US.
[2:54:37.920 --> 2:54:40.920]  I mean, this pedophile takeover is out in the open.
[2:54:40.920 --> 2:54:42.920]  Why are they pushing it so hard now?
[2:54:42.920 --> 2:54:44.920]  It's everywhere.
[2:54:44.920 --> 2:54:47.920]  Well, it's a matter of adjusting people to it.
[2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:51.920]  You know, first you tolerate something and now you, you know, have to have the problem.
[2:54:51.920 --> 2:54:54.920]  Alex, the bottom line is you've got to get your kids out of the public schools.
[2:54:54.920 --> 2:54:56.920]  Public schools are controlled by the government.
[2:54:56.920 --> 2:55:00.920]  They're going to get more and more of this transgender education, this pro-gay education.
[2:55:00.920 --> 2:55:03.920]  You just simply got to get your kids out.
[2:55:03.920 --> 2:55:07.920]  And, you know, California is shutting down the vaccine exemptions.
[2:55:07.920 --> 2:55:11.920]  And you simply have to say, I'm sorry, we're not dealing with this anymore.
[2:55:11.920 --> 2:55:14.920]  There's no way and you should never try to improve the public schools.
[2:55:14.920 --> 2:55:17.920]  You don't try to improve an inherently evil institution.
[2:55:17.920 --> 2:55:20.920]  It just keeps people in there longer.
[2:55:20.920 --> 2:55:25.920]  People need to get their kids out of public schools either through private or homeschooling education.
[2:55:25.920 --> 2:55:27.920]  And I know it's a great sacrifice.
[2:55:27.920 --> 2:55:31.920]  My wife and I, all of our six children, it can be done.
[2:55:31.920 --> 2:55:36.920]  They're very intelligent professionals now and so I encourage people to do that.
[2:55:36.920 --> 2:55:40.920]  But there's no solution to this except getting out of the public education system.
[2:55:40.920 --> 2:55:45.920]  Well, if you read the history books and if you read the Bible, this happens over and over again before it collapse.
[2:55:45.920 --> 2:55:49.920]  The system comes to have sex with and kill the children.
[2:55:49.920 --> 2:55:53.920]  It is a demonic lust and it's very real.
[2:55:53.920 --> 2:55:56.920]  World Affairs Brief.com. Thank you, Joel Scousen.
[2:55:56.920 --> 2:56:03.920]  Thank you, Alex. And people get a free sample issue by emailing me at editor at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[2:56:03.920 --> 2:56:05.920]  All right, thank you.
[2:56:05.920 --> 2:56:09.920]  I'm going to hit a few more stories that have broken that I haven't had time to get to.
[2:56:09.920 --> 2:56:13.920]  And then we have Charles Salente taking over at about 10 after or so.
[2:56:13.920 --> 2:56:21.920]  But I'm going to do a few more segments because I got a few clips, a few things I haven't hit that are really, really important that I want to cover when we come back on the side of the break.
[2:56:21.920 --> 2:56:25.920]  Really briefly here, we are bringing you Black Friday two months early.
[2:56:25.920 --> 2:56:27.920]  It's called Black Friday.
[2:56:27.920 --> 2:56:39.920]  Black Friday comes early sale and it's all of the supplements, 50% off, store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points.
[2:56:39.920 --> 2:56:47.920]  Again, infowarsstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:56:47.920 --> 2:56:59.920]  Let me tell you, our silver skin cream with the hyaluronic acid and the vitamins and the silver salt patented solution that's in the silver salt wound gel cream.
[2:56:59.920 --> 2:57:04.920]  It's also in this at 50% off. It's almost at cost, but I want you to see how great it is.
[2:57:04.920 --> 2:57:06.920]  I want you to experience it.
[2:57:06.920 --> 2:57:08.920]  We need to get something else while you're on the site.
[2:57:08.920 --> 2:57:13.920]  But all the supplements, all those products are 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points.
[2:57:13.920 --> 2:57:16.920]  We always sell a ton of stuff when we do this, but the margins are very, very small.
[2:57:16.920 --> 2:57:18.920]  So this is a true Black Friday sale.
[2:57:18.920 --> 2:57:24.920]  We're doing it early so that we do things differently here and can only run through this week.
[2:57:24.920 --> 2:57:30.920]  infowarsstore.com, all the storeable foods, all the water filtration, everything's 50% off as well.
[2:57:30.920 --> 2:57:33.920]  Habit done specials this big since last Christmas.
[2:57:33.920 --> 2:57:35.920]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:36.920]  These are great deals.
[2:57:36.920 --> 2:57:40.920]  Support yourself, your family and the American way by funding the info war.
[2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:42.920]  It's never been easier.
[2:57:42.920 --> 2:57:50.920]  There are a few things in this universe that are assured of that, but I'm here to tell you the products that infowarslive.com are.
[2:57:50.920 --> 2:58:00.920]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[2:58:00.920 --> 2:58:04.920]  And then we make it even stronger, even better and lower the price.
[2:58:04.920 --> 2:58:10.920]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system.
[2:58:10.920 --> 2:58:12.920]  So many things. It sells itself.
[2:58:12.920 --> 2:58:21.920]  But normal turmeric only has 3 to 5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[2:58:21.920 --> 2:58:23.920]  Originally obviously from India.
[2:58:23.920 --> 2:58:29.920]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level,
[2:58:29.920 --> 2:58:35.920]  but it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[2:58:35.920 --> 2:58:42.920]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet, 50% off on bodies at infowarslive.com.
[2:59:05.920 --> 2:59:11.920]  We're going to give you real Black Friday prices months early in late September and early October.
[2:59:11.920 --> 2:59:22.920]  It's going to run as long as supplies last across the board, at least 50% off, store-wide, free shipping, double-patriot points, and more.
[2:59:22.920 --> 2:59:28.920]  We've not done this, ladies and gentlemen, since last Christmas, but I want you to take advantage of this.
[2:59:28.920 --> 2:59:32.920]  We need funds to run our operations, so it is a win-win.
[2:59:32.920 --> 2:59:36.920]  We're going into 2020, InfoWars needs the funds, plus these are great products.
[2:59:36.920 --> 3:00:03.920]  Go take advantage of them right now at infowarsstore.com or infowarslife.com, or triple-eight, 253-3139.
[3:00:06.920 --> 3:00:16.920]  Coming up, we've got the video, two teams charged after a man 59 dies from knockout game attack at County Fair.
[3:00:16.920 --> 3:00:20.920]  Innocent man's sucker punched the head, later dies in trauma warden.
[3:00:20.920 --> 3:00:24.920]  Of course, it's almost all black on white, but nobody ever will tell you that.
[3:00:24.920 --> 3:00:29.920]  Hell, not even in full war sometimes. It's just very sad how they're pushing the race war.
[3:00:29.920 --> 3:00:34.920]  Also, GOP challenger Bill Weld, Trump committed treason and therefore must be executed.
[3:00:34.920 --> 3:00:39.920]  Yes, this is the latest super escalation we're going to get to here in just a moment.
[3:00:39.920 --> 3:00:43.920]  And the formula for gun confiscation in civil war, that's another key special report.
[3:00:43.920 --> 3:00:49.920]  That's all up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[3:00:49.920 --> 3:00:53.920]  Speaking of those articles, let's get to the Bill Weld story right now.
[3:00:53.920 --> 3:00:59.920]  GOP challenger Bill Weld, Trump committed treason and therefore must be executed.
[3:00:59.920 --> 3:01:06.920]  Media doesn't push back on appalling statement. GOP primary challenger in former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld.
[3:01:06.920 --> 3:01:11.920]  There's a Democrat in reality, but not a name.
[3:01:11.920 --> 3:01:17.920]  Accused President Trump of committing treason during a phone call with the Ukrainian president,
[3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:21.920]  adding that the required punishment is death.
[3:01:21.920 --> 3:01:25.920]  When Hillary sold herself to China and Russia and everything else, that's just fine.
[3:01:25.920 --> 3:01:29.920]  Trump tries to expose Hillary, the punishment is death, even though it's not even true.
[3:01:29.920 --> 3:01:34.920]  Talk about pressure from a foreign country to intervene with the control of the U.S. election.
[3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:37.920]  That's not just undermining democratic institutions.
[3:01:37.920 --> 3:01:40.920]  This is treason, Weld said on MSNBC's Morning Joe.
[3:01:40.920 --> 3:01:43.920]  And that clip is coming up next segment.
[3:01:43.920 --> 3:01:46.920]  We're going to get Gerald Salente's take on that.
[3:01:46.920 --> 3:01:49.920]  We're going to play that video next segment. It's up on infowars.com.
[3:01:49.920 --> 3:01:56.920]  Host Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, whose father did engineer mass murder worldwide and bragged about it in several books,
[3:01:56.920 --> 3:02:03.920]  made no attempt to push back against Weld's outrageous statement calling for the execution of a sitting U.S. president.
[3:02:03.920 --> 3:02:07.920]  Weld then stated that Trump could possibly escape execution if he works out a plea deal,
[3:02:07.920 --> 3:02:10.920]  presumably with congressional, Democrats, and neighbor Trumpers.
[3:02:10.920 --> 3:02:13.920]  So they're now openly threatening to kill the president.
[3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:21.920]  The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office. That might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal.
[3:02:21.920 --> 3:02:30.920]  Scarborough Brzezinski and the other guest panel then launched into a discussion about the legal framework of handing down a death sentence to President Trump.
[3:02:30.920 --> 3:02:33.920]  The only penalty for treason is death. It spelled out in the statute.
[3:02:33.920 --> 3:02:44.920]  Weld said the left is accusing Trump of wrongdoing for asking the Ukraine government to get to the bottom of shady dealings involving Joe Biden's son, Hunter.
[3:02:44.920 --> 3:02:47.920]  Now, the treason is exposing their treason.
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:55.920]  Biden has admitted to threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees if the Ukraine government did not borrow a prosecutor.
[3:02:55.920 --> 3:03:03.920]  That's right, looking into his son's lucrative deals with an energy company called Burzum and Holdings. And then it goes on.
[3:03:03.920 --> 3:03:07.920]  So they've done all this, but Trump's the man that's guilty of treason.
[3:03:07.920 --> 3:03:11.920]  We'll play that clip when we come back and get to this.
[3:03:11.920 --> 3:03:17.920]  Two teams charged after Man 59 dies from knockout game attack at County Fair.
[3:03:17.920 --> 3:03:27.920]  And again, there's so many knockout game deaths. Every day I see one, every day there's videos of white people being beaten up, women, men by large groups of young black males.
[3:03:27.920 --> 3:03:33.920]  Now, again, that's a racist group of black males. Doesn't mean even a minority, a large minority of blacks are like that.
[3:03:33.920 --> 3:03:39.920]  But there are some racist black people and you see it all over the news where these groups say, let's go out and attack whites. They're inherently bad.
[3:03:39.920 --> 3:03:50.920]  That's this anti-white atmosphere that the left has created that's terrible. And then the media, once the attacks happen, try to cover them up or never say it's racially focused or biased.
[3:03:50.920 --> 3:03:56.920]  I meant to get to this last Friday and I meant to get to it Sunday. I've just been so busy I haven't gotten to it.
[3:03:56.920 --> 3:04:01.920]  We have a compilation of videos, a very small portion of them of blacks attacking whites.
[3:04:01.920 --> 3:04:11.920]  And then T.I., the rapper, when I was on his show, I suppose he was going to air this Thursday, last week in L.A., he just brought up some video of a little white kid beating up a black kid.
[3:04:11.920 --> 3:04:15.920]  And I don't like watching the footage. I wouldn't like seeing a white kid beat up like that or anybody.
[3:04:15.920 --> 3:04:23.920]  But he says, this show is the epidemic of white on black violence, but we have the statistics.
[3:04:23.920 --> 3:04:28.920]  So I'm going to put a report together. It's not the day it'll be tomorrow that I'm going to actually shoot where I can lay all this out.
[3:04:28.920 --> 3:04:32.920]  You know what? I'll tape it right when I hand over to Salente. That way we have it for tomorrow.
[3:04:32.920 --> 3:04:38.920]  So we can add all this together in one big shebang for you. Because I'm going to show you the statistics. I'm going to show you the videos.
[3:04:38.920 --> 3:04:45.920]  I'm going to show it to you all. And then ask T.I. Really, T.I.? Because the reality is it's open season on white people.
[3:04:45.920 --> 3:04:50.920]  And that's what the crowd statistics show. And it's very, very dangerous. It's going to have a backlash that I don't want.
[3:04:50.920 --> 3:05:00.920]  We sold Secret 12 for four years, and it was our number third best seller. We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[3:05:00.920 --> 3:05:07.920]  That new formula is Ultra 12. It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[3:05:07.920 --> 3:05:16.920]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things, supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy,
[3:05:16.920 --> 3:05:21.920]  helps reduce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function. It goes on and on.
[3:05:21.920 --> 3:05:29.920]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[3:05:29.920 --> 3:05:38.920]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12. It helps fund the infowar. So it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:38.920 --> 3:05:50.920]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last. Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[3:06:09.920 --> 3:06:13.920]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:18.920 --> 3:06:23.920]  So I've been asking, what is peak leftist insanity trying to bully and dominate civilization?
[3:06:23.920 --> 3:06:34.920]  Now they're in the news, pushing what Jocelyn Elders did as the surgeon general under Clinton, had the state teacher, five-year-old in kindergarten, had a masturbate.
[3:06:34.920 --> 3:06:41.920]  England's already doing it. That's in the news. But now, former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld has come out and said,
[3:06:41.920 --> 3:06:50.920]  execute President Trump for treason because he investigated, supposedly, Hillary and Biden's corruption over in Ukraine.
[3:06:50.920 --> 3:06:57.920]  Something Trump says he didn't even do. He didn't demand that you do this or all cut funding.
[3:06:57.920 --> 3:07:05.920]  It was actually Biden that admits he did that. So you wonder where they're going next. They're getting ready to try to kill the president.
[3:07:05.920 --> 3:07:12.920]  And he thinks he's invincible. He thinks he can handle all this. He thinks it's under control. I don't think it is.
[3:07:12.920 --> 3:07:19.920]  These people need to start getting in trouble for their bullying, their attacks, their censorship, and what they've been doing to this country.
[3:07:19.920 --> 3:07:29.920]  Let's say in MS-13's All God's Children, telling people to flood the border, telling people to kill border patrol, all the attacks on ICE facilities, the attacks on Trump supporters,
[3:07:29.920 --> 3:07:39.920]  the attack on Congressman Scalise, where this leftist tried to kill the entire conservative coalition of Congress, and then CNN said the guy was a hero.
[3:07:39.920 --> 3:07:52.920]  Go to their houses, terrorize them. Maxine waters and all of them say. Unbelievable. So here is Governor Weld really escalating the situation.
[3:07:52.920 --> 3:08:00.920]  This is the GOP challenge. This is the Spencer attack that Trump's under because he dares stand up for the people.
[3:08:00.920 --> 3:08:04.920]  And all we're saying is, Trump, take the gloves off. Here it is.
[3:08:04.920 --> 3:08:16.920]  Obviously, canceling primaries undermines democratic institutions and democratic elections, but that's far from the deepest die crime that the president has committed here.
[3:08:16.920 --> 3:08:30.920]  He's now acknowledged that in a single phone call, right after he suspended $250 million of military aid to Ukraine, he called up the president of Ukraine and pressed him eight times to investigate Joe Biden,
[3:08:30.920 --> 3:08:39.920]  who the president thinks is going to be running against him. Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election.
[3:08:39.920 --> 3:08:47.920]  It couldn't be clearer. And that's not just undermining democratic institutions. That is treason. It's treason, pure and simple.
[3:08:47.920 --> 3:08:53.920]  And the penalty for treason under the U.S. Code is death. That's the only penalty.
[3:08:53.920 --> 3:09:00.920]  The penalty is death. So Trump talks to this guy, talks about the corruption, which you're supposed to do, exposing it.
[3:09:00.920 --> 3:09:04.920]  And that's the big crime. But they're trying to go, oh, but he offered him something or threatened him.
[3:09:04.920 --> 3:09:09.920]  But Joe Biden admits he did that. So everything they're saying about Trump, they're projecting.
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:13.920]  But let's play this clip as we go to Gerol Silente, because it's very important.
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:19.920]  And Drudge has, this is his top headline, that Trump has been very cocky about all this.
[3:09:19.920 --> 3:09:25.920]  And I get why he is, it's a fraud. But you can't be cocky unless you take action against these crooks.
[3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:31.920]  I mean, all the lies about Kavanaugh, the lies about me, the lies about everybody, he just gets worse and worse and worse.
[3:09:31.920 --> 3:09:39.920]  So here is NBC reporting on Trump and the fact that does, is he convinced of his invincibility?
[3:09:39.920 --> 3:09:43.920]  Because he doesn't need the Internet. He doesn't need talk radio that's being shut down.
[3:09:43.920 --> 3:09:51.920]  He doesn't need all of us to help him get elected anymore, because he's not taking action against the censorship yet. Here it is.
[3:09:51.920 --> 3:09:59.920]  The president's whistleblower strategy. A Twitter defense. Trump did nothing wrong. And a Twitter attack.
[3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:05.920]  Repeatedly fueling unsupported allegations against political rival Joe Biden.
[3:10:05.920 --> 3:10:16.920]  The president posted claims, including an edited video alleging Biden used influence in Ukraine to help his son Hunter's business interest there.
[3:10:16.920 --> 3:10:21.920]  But no evidence of wrongdoing was found. The tactic hit a nerve for Biden.
[3:10:21.920 --> 3:10:33.920]  Trump's doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum. And he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.
[3:10:33.920 --> 3:10:41.920]  The president also tried to deflect attention by branding the secret whistleblower complaint Ukraine witch hunt.
[3:10:41.920 --> 3:10:47.920]  The allegation centers on a July call between President Trump and Ukraine President Zelensky.
[3:10:47.920 --> 3:10:56.920]  The Washington Post and New York Times report that Mr. Trump urged Ukraine to look into the Biden family, according to people briefed on the call.
[3:10:56.920 --> 3:11:04.920]  Who also said the president did not discuss U.S. military aid to Ukraine. NBC News did not confirm the reporting.
[3:11:04.920 --> 3:11:18.920]  Congress has not seen the intelligence officers complaint. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein sent a letter to Attorney General Barr Friday demanding the whistleblower report be shared with key committees.
[3:11:18.920 --> 3:11:23.920]  In Iowa, a frustrated Biden called the president's actions outrageous.
[3:11:23.920 --> 3:11:29.920]  Why is he on the phone with a foreign leader trying to intimidate a foreign leader if that's what happened?
[3:11:29.920 --> 3:11:34.920]  But some Republican senators dismissed the complaint as partisan.
[3:11:34.920 --> 3:11:37.920]  You're never going to see the attack stop.
[3:11:37.920 --> 3:11:39.920]  It looks to me like another deep state attack.
[3:11:39.920 --> 3:11:51.920]  Well, that's exactly what it is. So confidence, arrogance, unless we see them go after the deep state and these impending indictments that are reportedly already handed down against McCabe and others.
[3:11:51.920 --> 3:11:53.920]  It's only going to encourage these people more.
[3:11:53.920 --> 3:11:57.920]  So if I'm angry at Trump, it's because he's not taking enough action and we're all on this together.
[3:11:57.920 --> 3:12:06.920]  I totally support the president. I just am sitting here in the boiling hot water that he's also sitting in and I'm saying that we're dealing with a pack of out of control criminals.
[3:12:06.920 --> 3:12:12.920]  And notice they say I'm substantiated. It's totally substantiated about Ukraine. Hillary paid for the fake dossier out of there.
[3:12:12.920 --> 3:12:17.920]  Biden's son went and took over the big $4 billion gas company and got a bunch of money.
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:23.920]  So, by the way, here's that supposedly unsubstantiated edited montage.
[3:12:23.920 --> 3:12:28.920]  These are the same people that say Carpe Dongtum edited Biden groping himself.
[3:12:28.920 --> 3:12:32.920]  That's you deceptively that he doctored it.
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:38.920]  It's not doctored when I show a Chinese dragon named fentanyl telling us communism's good.
[3:12:38.920 --> 3:12:40.920]  It's called a joke.
[3:12:40.920 --> 3:12:45.920]  So this is not doctored, though. This is this is what they've already reported.
[3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:48.920]  This is known about Ukraine. Here it is.
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:20.920]  And did Joe Biden allow it? We're talking about millions of dollars in at least two countries.
[3:13:20.920 --> 3:13:36.920]  We have Joe Biden as vice president having intervened to sort of force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who happened to have an open case looking into a Ukrainian gas company that was employing Joe Biden's son.
[3:13:36.920 --> 3:13:41.920]  There's no reason to pay Hunter Biden $50,000 a month.
[3:13:41.920 --> 3:13:45.920]  Hunter Biden worked for a natural gas company in Ukraine, which is a totally fair game.
[3:13:45.920 --> 3:13:50.920]  Did the vice president's son use his dad's influence to make money somewhere in the world? That's a totally fair game.
[3:13:50.920 --> 3:13:53.920]  A potential conflict of interest there that I think Joe Biden will have to answer for.
[3:13:53.920 --> 3:13:58.920]  Hunter Biden's work with the company reportedly sparked concern among State Department officials.
[3:13:58.920 --> 3:14:04.920]  But was it right for Hunter Biden to take a job like that in Ukraine while his father was engaging diplomacy there?
[3:14:04.920 --> 3:14:08.920]  There is a story here. We've told some of it. There's more to be told.
[3:14:08.920 --> 3:14:13.920]  I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars. I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here.
[3:14:13.920 --> 3:14:19.920]  I think it was, what, six hours? I looked, I said, leaving six hours. If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[3:14:19.920 --> 3:14:27.920]  If the prosecutor's not fired, if the prosecutor's not fired, if the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[3:14:27.920 --> 3:14:36.920]  So that was smoking gun proof in the last month where they're undermining Biden for Elizabeth Warren because they know he's had another stroke.
[3:14:36.920 --> 3:14:46.920]  They got to get rid of it. And so Trump's like, you're saying I'm threatening people to fire folks or go after Biden or I'm going to cut aid.
[3:14:46.920 --> 3:14:54.920]  That's exactly what you did in Bragg at the CFR because you guys buy and sell U.S. power and U.S. diplomacy.
[3:14:54.920 --> 3:15:03.920]  You do it publicly. You're mad. I'm here and not doing that anymore. So you're blaming me. Here's a video showing it and they call that edited.
[3:15:03.920 --> 3:15:10.920]  Well, edited for brevity, but those are all little pieces of interviews, whole segments where they documented this.
[3:15:10.920 --> 3:15:15.920]  But only because they want to have their K community, too. They want to burn Biden to get rid of him for Elizabeth Warren.
[3:15:15.920 --> 3:15:20.920]  But then they also want to burn Trump with the same recycled crap when there's no evidence of it.
[3:15:20.920 --> 3:15:25.920]  And the big news is the president's being spied on. Gerald Selente takes over on the other side. Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen,

[3:20:12.920 --> 3:20:28.920]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:20:28.920 --> 3:20:42.920]  Hello, hello, hello. Hope you like the show. Great being here on the Alex Jones show and Info Wars. I want to pick up on a couple of things that Alex was talking about that I heard. I was waiting to go on the air.
[3:20:42.920 --> 3:21:02.920]  And about racism in America. What a racist nation. I mean, we're so racist in this country that there's no way, no way that we would ever elect a black president could not happen in America.
[3:21:02.920 --> 3:21:19.920]  The racist nation. No way in America could we have a secretary of state like Condoleezza Rice or black woman, never. And a murderous one at that.
[3:21:19.920 --> 3:21:40.920]  Yeah, just like the murderous Obama, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner. Yeah, I want to get rid of that guy. I want him out of there. I don't care who you kill. I don't care if you destroy the most prosperous nation in the world.
[3:21:40.920 --> 3:21:53.920]  I don't care what you do. I want him out. And we'll turn it into a hellhole. Like I did. No black man would ever say that.
[3:21:53.920 --> 3:22:04.920]  How about Condoleezza Rice on the bush? That mushroom cloud you see. Yeah, that mushroom cloud.
[3:22:04.920 --> 3:22:29.920]  What color is she? How about Colin Powell, huh? And you know what goes through the colon? A lot of crap. Yeah, and it comes out right out of his mouth as he holds up that little vial of colon crap to the United Nations and says it's proof that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction.
[3:22:29.920 --> 3:22:36.920]  Don't forget ties to Al Qaeda. What color is he?
[3:22:36.920 --> 3:22:48.920]  America, the racist nation, no way, no way would we ever have a black Supreme Court judge. Could not happen.
[3:22:48.920 --> 3:23:04.920]  Hey, who knows people run for Presidente in the presidential reality show. Corey Booker, Camilla Harris, which they're both in office. No, they can never have those kind of offices.
[3:23:04.920 --> 3:23:23.920]  Not in racist America. Hey, how about Eric Holder? Yeah, hold this slimy low life piece of garbage as Attorney General under Obama. Too big to fail. Remember that one?
[3:23:23.920 --> 3:23:44.920]  No, you forgot the banks were too big to fail and they were too big to jail. And now what is he doing? Oh, that black cat's working for a white shoe firm over there, one of the biggest Wall Street legal firms that keeps giving us the shift when they want to protect their
[3:23:44.920 --> 3:24:05.920]  interests. Covington, Berlin. That's right. America is not a racist nation. Are there racists in America? Of course there are. Are there in the cells, low life and dirty pieces of garbage in America? Absolutely.
[3:24:05.920 --> 3:24:23.920]  And they come in all races, creeds, colors and gender. And all you have to do is begin with the demo craps and the repulse of kids and work your way down the line.
[3:24:23.920 --> 3:24:43.920]  Low lives everywhere. Morons in the cells, cowards, freaks and fools. We are not a racist nation. We elected Barack Obama. Good and bad comes in all races, creeds, colors and genders.
[3:24:43.920 --> 3:24:54.920]  I'm tired of this belonging. And moving on. What else do we have here? Well, what Alex was also talking about, this is the major news.
[3:24:54.920 --> 3:25:04.920]  Headline. Financial time. This paper costs me a lot of money every day. I want to buy it for good news. I got to find out because I have to forecast trends.
[3:25:04.920 --> 3:25:17.920]  So I need the current events for me for future trends that have detail, facts and information that can help me look ahead. What's the major story?
[3:25:17.920 --> 3:25:30.920]  Trump hits back over pressing Ukraine to hurt Biden campaign. This is totally worthless information.
[3:25:30.920 --> 3:25:54.920]  Trump says Biden came up on call. Wall Street Journal. From the paper of record, the New York time, front page, Trump cited Biden and called new pressure to impeach.
[3:25:54.920 --> 3:26:09.920]  This is totally worthless in propaganda. You will learn nothing from this information. I study all day long reading the current events, forming future trends.
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:28.920]  This is as worthless as the three years that went on that the Russians hacked into the American election system and hacked into the DNC. And Hillary Clinton didn't lose because he's a disgusting human being like a husband.
[3:26:28.920 --> 3:26:46.920]  No, I had nothing to do with her deals with Wall Street. Oh, like her slimy, slick, willy husband who killed the Glass-Steagall Act. And Eric Holder this was also under the Clinton administration when they did that.
[3:26:46.920 --> 3:26:59.920]  Plus covering up for Clinton and on and on. That's not why she lost. The Russians did it, I tell you, and will really be stupid ignorant fools and believe what they found.
[3:26:59.920 --> 3:27:21.920]  They spent $100,000 in Facebook. $100,000 in social media. That's chump change. 4.5 billion dollar campaign. 2.5 billion some ridiculous number like that. Chump change. Big company spends $100,000 in social marketing.
[3:27:21.920 --> 3:27:33.920]  And all the websites and all the different platforms ends up to nothing. You're a small time loser. But let's make it a big story so you don't know what's going to happen.
[3:27:33.920 --> 3:27:42.920]  So you can't see the current events, forming future trends, get caught up in the stupidity and then start talking about it with your friends.
[3:27:42.920 --> 3:27:57.920]  I was at a dinner couple of nights ago for a foundation kind of thing, you know, different people. And I'm talking to these two gentlemen and we start talking about economics and politics.
[3:27:57.920 --> 3:28:11.920]  And then after that, these are guys, you know, my age, a little younger. They spent over a half hour talking about sports.
[3:28:11.920 --> 3:28:22.920]  I mean, I like sports when I was a kid, but this isn't my life. And this isn't important to me. The important issues are gone.
[3:28:22.920 --> 3:28:29.920]  And that's what you're seeing here. All this talk about impeachment adds up to zero.
[3:28:29.920 --> 3:28:42.920]  And by the way, if the election were held today and remember the Trends Journal, my magazine was the first magazine to call Trump a winner. In May of 2016, Trump would win today.
[3:28:42.920 --> 3:29:00.920]  This stuff doesn't mean anything other than the people in the media. You're right back.
[3:29:13.920 --> 3:29:23.920]  Our microwavable heat wraps, heatable neck pillows and extra large body wraps are designed better for perfect support where and when you need it.

[3:33:10.920 --> 3:33:19.920]  Waging war on corruption. It's Gerald Salente. You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:19.920 --> 3:33:42.920]  Hello, hello, hello. We hope you like the show. Glad you're back. Great being here. So that was about it on the what's going on with this stupid impeachment stuff.
[3:33:42.920 --> 3:33:56.920]  It's a waste of time and our money. You know, these demo craps and repulsive kins forget whether it's down from the state level, city level up to the top of the federal government.
[3:33:56.920 --> 3:34:04.920]  Two words, public servants. Do what we tell you. Don't tell us what to do.
[3:34:04.920 --> 3:34:22.920]  So, on a couple of notes. Do you know what Saturday was? September 21st? International Peace Day. But don't tell anybody because the news hardly reported it along.
[3:34:22.920 --> 3:34:28.920]  Oh, and do you know what United Nations International Peace Day?
[3:34:28.920 --> 3:34:40.920]  Motive was this year. Climate change. Climate change? What are you worried about climate change for? They're poisoning us right now.
[3:34:40.920 --> 3:34:49.920]  You have to wait for climate to change. You'll be dead by then. Crap that they're throwing in our food and the water and the air and the earth.
[3:34:49.920 --> 3:35:01.920]  Chemicals, the drug companies killing us. Opiates. You're worried about climate change.
[3:35:01.920 --> 3:35:04.920]  So, barely reported.
[3:35:04.920 --> 3:35:20.920]  And as you well know, I launched Occupy Peace. I'm just thinking, oh, you ready to start in there? It turns journal magazine Occupy Peace. So if you want to put your money where your heart is, Occupy Peace.
[3:35:20.920 --> 3:35:26.920]  Want war? Let the people vote. I want to referendum on each state ballot.
[3:35:26.920 --> 3:35:34.920]  And when the United States decides to go to war, we the people will tell them how to vote because we pay for the war with our money and our lives.
[3:35:34.920 --> 3:35:44.920]  Again, International Peace Day. Peace doesn't count in this country. It just came out with a study recently.
[3:35:44.920 --> 3:36:01.920]  Pew Research. Pew Research Center poll suggests that both the general public and U.S. veterans agree things in Afghanistan were not handled well.
[3:36:01.920 --> 3:36:27.920]  What's only, what, 18 years were going on? It's just about that now. I think next month. In a survey conducted, 59% of the public and 58% of the vets said that when considering cost-verse benefits, the Afghan war was, quote, not worth fighting.
[3:36:27.920 --> 3:36:43.920]  And only about 2,500 American troops were killed. Hundreds of thousands wounded were suffering mentally from being there. Post-traumatic stress syndrome and other things.
[3:36:43.920 --> 3:36:59.920]  We only have, he's about 22 veterans, military veterans committing suicide each day. But let's not talk about peace. We got impeachment to talk about.
[3:36:59.920 --> 3:37:18.920]  Impeachments are a lot more important than waging wars, spending trillions to kill millions, and only a track record of losses at which Congress is in violation of the Constitution.
[3:37:18.920 --> 3:37:32.920]  I believe it's Article 1, Clause 8, that only Congress has the right to vote to go to war, which they have not done since World War II, and given the power to El Presidente.
[3:37:32.920 --> 3:37:44.920]  And the guy we got in there now, he says he's locked and loaded. Well, he's loaded full of baloney. Because let me tell you, now, a new trend, a trend journal now, by the way, is a weekly.
[3:37:44.920 --> 3:38:12.920]  A new trend journal coming out tomorrow, the weekly. The reason why, back in June 20th, to be exact, when Trump announced that he was not going to retaliate against Iran after Iran shot down that drone,
[3:38:12.920 --> 3:38:24.920]  that cost about $200 million, yeah, that drone that they said was over their land and America said it was an international territory.
[3:38:24.920 --> 3:38:40.920]  The reason it didn't strike is very simple. It would be the beginning of World War III. The Middle East will be blown apart and it will spread.
[3:38:40.920 --> 3:39:01.920]  Iran is not Libya. It's not Syria. It's not Afghanistan. It's not Yemen. These are the Iranians. Love them, hate them, care less. These are the Persians.
[3:39:01.920 --> 3:39:21.920]  They've been around a long time and they're not going anywhere. And now they have sophisticated weaponry. And by the way, that strike, drone strike on the oil fields and refinery, the largest refinery in the world in Saudi Arabia
[3:39:21.920 --> 3:39:36.920]  and one of the largest oil fields. There's absolutely no proof that Iran had anything to do with it. The Houthis, Yemen, are saying they did it.
[3:39:36.920 --> 3:39:51.920]  But the American media is selling the lie without providing one shred of evidence, just like the low life, slimy, prostitute media without any evidence took us to war in Iraq.
[3:39:51.920 --> 3:40:15.920]  Just like the slimy low life prostitutes, you know, the media whores, men and women who get paid by their government and corporate pimps to put out the lies that they're saying, just like they didn't provide one shred of evidence
[3:40:15.920 --> 3:40:25.920]  that Russia hacked into the DNC, but that's our conclusion. That's what we believe. Yeah, try that and go in a court.
[3:40:25.920 --> 3:40:44.920]  The same thing with Iran and the strike, the drone strike in against Saudi Arabia. Not one shred of evidence, but yet the entire American media is blaming the Saudis for doing it.
[3:40:44.920 --> 3:41:03.920]  Let me see if I could find this here. Well, again, I'm saying why Trump called off that drone strike, because if he did attack Iran back in June, following the drone strike.
[3:41:03.920 --> 3:41:21.920]  The Straits of Hormuz would have been Pearl Harbor 2.0. The American Navy would be a bloodbath. That's why they didn't attack.
[3:41:21.920 --> 3:41:43.920]  The hatefulness that continues is nonstop. There's a major story today feature top news story in Yahoo. This is the headline explained why did Iran attack Saudi Arabia's oil industry.
[3:41:43.920 --> 3:42:03.920]  Here's what's going on. Not one fact, but in the day of people reading everything in their hand, only reading headlines and living by sound bites.
[3:42:03.920 --> 3:42:21.920]  The people by the sound bite. Why did Iran attack Saudi Arabia's oil industry? Here's what's going on. A total fabrication. And this comes from Stratfor and you know who they are.
[3:42:21.920 --> 3:42:39.920]  Do you know? Google them up and then you understand, part of whatever you want to believe. As I say it, very closely knit to the military intelligence industrial complex.
[3:42:39.920 --> 3:42:50.920]  We back in just a few and remember support info wars. I do. Put your money where your heart and mind is. Keep the truth flowing. We'll be right back.
[3:42:50.920 --> 3:43:10.920]  Band.video is the answer to censorship. Band.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are still available.
[3:43:10.920 --> 3:43:22.920]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen. It's now live. Band.video. Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson band videos.
[3:43:22.920 --> 3:43:40.920]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted and where a growing list of freedom loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum and the globalist.
[3:43:40.920 --> 3:43:50.920]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band.video. America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[3:43:50.920 --> 3:43:59.920]  September is almost over and right now we're offering store-wide free shipping, double patriot points and 50% off for a limited time.
[3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:09.920]  As a lot of you know, I don't play by the establishment's rules. In fact, I like to hijack things they've created and turn it towards the use of the people and the information war.
[3:44:09.920 --> 3:44:11.920]  And we're doing that right now with a big game changer.

[3:44:58.920 --> 3:45:09.920]  We run, during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads. So you think you don't want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad. But here's the bottom line.
[3:45:09.920 --> 3:45:17.920]  We're barely paying the bills here, and I want to expand the face the globalists not contract. I don't want them to win. So listen, you've got this guarantee for me.
[3:45:17.920 --> 3:45:29.920]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs, and we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money. But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2. These will change your life.

[3:47:17.920 --> 3:47:23.920]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:47:23.920 --> 3:47:33.920]  Hello, hello. All right. I'm on the Alex Jones show. And remember to keep the truth alive.
[3:47:33.920 --> 3:47:41.920]  Put your money where your heart is and buy those wonderful, wonderful products from Infowars stores. And here's something important.
[3:47:41.920 --> 3:47:49.920]  As you well know, or maybe don't, I'm forecasting the greatest oppression. It's going to hit.
[3:47:49.920 --> 3:48:01.920]  You saw what happened this past week. The Federal Reserve is dumping in billions of dollars into the markets, the repo markets, because they don't have enough cash in it.
[3:48:01.920 --> 3:48:06.920]  There's a global slowdown going on. Again, it's all detailed and now it trends journals.
[3:48:06.920 --> 3:48:15.920]  I'm mentioning this because this is a time to prepare so you can prevail and prosper because when this thing hits, it's going to get ugly.
[3:48:15.920 --> 3:48:28.920]  So you can now save up to 50% off all storable food, water filters and preparedness products. That's right.
[3:48:28.920 --> 3:48:34.920]  Beyond the natural disasters like hurricane Dorian and argon earthquakes and incoming storms and floods.
[3:48:34.920 --> 3:48:45.920]  Yes, it's most important than ever to be prepared. But also when things are heating up and war drums are beating louder.
[3:48:45.920 --> 3:48:55.920]  And you also see a greatest oppression coming. You want to be secure.
[3:48:55.920 --> 3:49:06.920]  You want to be able to be prepared to celebrate preparedness month and help you get ready for what comes next.
[3:49:06.920 --> 3:49:13.920]  They're giving you up to 50% off storable food and other preparedness products.
[3:49:13.920 --> 3:49:28.920]  Because life select storable food is a great tasting, long lasting alternative for when disaster strikes available in time frame some two weeks to one year.
[3:49:28.920 --> 3:49:35.920]  They're perfect for bug out bags, home storage, camping trips and more.
[3:49:35.920 --> 3:49:46.920]  They're easy to prepare, have a 25 year lifespan and have no added MSG so you don't sacrifice taste for security.
[3:49:46.920 --> 3:49:56.920]  So there you got it. Things are going to get bad. So again, as we do with our subscribers, we know the greatest oppression is coming.
[3:49:56.920 --> 3:50:04.920]  It's time to prepare so you could prosper and prevail. And this is one of the ways of doing it.
[3:50:04.920 --> 3:50:15.920]  Going back to the war front. And again, not a peep from a prostitute days about International Peace Day on Saturday.
[3:50:15.920 --> 3:50:24.920]  Tiny peep. Squeak. Not even. Just a beep. It was gone. Google it up and you'll see.
[3:50:24.920 --> 3:50:34.920]  The United States drone strike just killed eight people in Afghanistan. They said it was ISIS's.
[3:50:34.920 --> 3:50:41.920]  Last week, over 30 civilians were killed. Oh, it was a mistake.
[3:50:41.920 --> 3:50:50.920]  Talk about that drone strike in Saudi Arabia. Oh, that's all the news. Why am I rainy as they did it even though we don't have any proof?
[3:50:50.920 --> 3:50:59.920]  Why did we got to stop this from happening? Partly a peep about the Saudi slaughter.
[3:50:59.920 --> 3:51:14.920]  Some 100,000 Yemenis. Some 14 million in starvation. The worst humanitarian crisis on the planet.
[3:51:14.920 --> 3:51:22.920]  I'm not going to talk about that, because the prince, our friend, the crown prince, over there in Saudi Arabia,
[3:51:22.920 --> 3:51:31.920]  he started that war back in 2015, launched from the USA, I remember it, the guy on TV.
[3:51:31.920 --> 3:51:41.920]  From D.C., a foreign minister, the Saudi Foreign Minister announcing the war, the Obama Administration and the Trump Administration supporting it,
[3:51:41.920 --> 3:51:46.920]  and selling hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of weaponry to slaughter these people.
[3:51:46.920 --> 3:51:55.920]  But we won't talk about that. That doesn't count. We'll only talk about them drone strikes. The Iranians did it.
[3:51:55.920 --> 3:52:01.920]  The hypocrisy is astounding, and it just keeps getting worse.
[3:52:01.920 --> 3:52:13.920]  We had our Secretary of State, Pampas Pompeo, saying that Iran's, that it was the world's responsibility to unite.
[3:52:13.920 --> 3:52:23.920]  And a global coalition to confront Iran declaring, quote, the Iranians are an evil force in the region.
[3:52:23.920 --> 3:52:30.920]  Evil force in the region. How about the Saudis being the evil force in the region?
[3:52:30.920 --> 3:52:35.920]  How about the Arab League, or the Arab Little League?
[3:52:35.920 --> 3:52:49.920]  Yeah, they're the ones that want to get rid of Libya. I was on China today with this jerk, this arrogant little boy who's Al Jazeera's Washington bureau chief.
[3:52:49.920 --> 3:53:08.920]  You can Google this up. Go back. 2011, the United States is ready to invade or destroy Libya, and he's making the case for it with a very arrogant English attitude and voice.
[3:53:08.920 --> 3:53:18.920]  And I call this guy out at the end of it, and I said, listen, you want to go to Libya, send your money, send yourself, send your wife and send your kids or shut your mouth.
[3:53:18.920 --> 3:53:26.920]  Well, this very, very uptight cat, he lost it completely.
[3:53:26.920 --> 3:53:38.920]  And then we're going off the air. This is China today, and he's still ranting. When you call him out, they fall out.
[3:53:38.920 --> 3:53:48.920]  We're destroying the world and destroying our nation. Occupied peace. Bring the troops home. Secure the homeland.
[3:53:48.920 --> 3:54:01.920]  Put them to work rebuilding our third world infrastructure. Give them skills rather than a mission to kill, because the construction industry and other industry are dying for them.
[3:54:01.920 --> 3:54:08.920]  So you don't have to die in war. And again, for what they say, war not worth it.
[3:54:08.920 --> 3:54:17.920]  Force Congress to vote to go to war, which they have not done since World War II, and have a referendum on each state ballot, where we were the people will tell them how to vote.
[3:54:17.920 --> 3:54:21.920]  Because we pay for the world our money and our lives.
[3:54:21.920 --> 3:54:36.920]  Pompeo went on. The whole world understands, that's the quote, that Iran is totally at fault and solely to blame for what he described as quote, state on state act of war.
[3:54:36.920 --> 3:54:49.920]  Hey, this is a lot of garbage, Secretary of State, that I have to pay these clowns to put out this crap is disgusting.
[3:54:49.920 --> 3:54:57.920]  Saudi Arabia is responsible. Get this in your head, Pompeo.
[3:54:57.920 --> 3:55:04.920]  They destroyed Yemen. The Yemenis are saying this is payback.
[3:55:04.920 --> 3:55:08.920]  You get out and we'll stop. You have no right being here.
[3:55:08.920 --> 3:55:21.920]  By the way, the Saudi gang began the war against the Uffies going back to 1934 when the gang took power. And they lost back then and they're losing now.
[3:55:21.920 --> 3:55:32.920]  But the prince said the war would be over shortly. That was back in 2015.
[3:55:32.920 --> 3:55:40.920]  State on state act of war. He said Iran is behaving that way for 40 years.
[3:55:40.920 --> 3:55:49.920]  Hey, what do you got Alzheimer's disease at a young age? What did you forget?
[3:55:49.920 --> 3:56:03.920]  You forgot Pompeo, the war that the United States launched with a rock against Iran that killed over a million Iranians back in the 1980s.
[3:56:03.920 --> 3:56:11.920]  Oh, you forgot that other low life piece of garbage, little dirt lying slime ball.
[3:56:11.920 --> 3:56:21.920]  Donald Rumsfeld given Saddam Hussein those golden spurs right at the outside of the outside of the war.
[3:56:21.920 --> 3:56:27.920]  Oh, who was there 40 years ago, Junior?
[3:56:27.920 --> 3:56:34.920]  It is disgusting that this is happening.
[3:56:34.920 --> 3:56:40.920]  That the people aren't fighting back in this country.
[3:56:40.920 --> 3:56:52.920]  We will not elevate to a higher level as a nation until we are in a state of peace, because with peace comes prosperity.
[3:56:52.920 --> 3:56:59.920]  It comes with joy. It comes with a good time rocking in a roll and bopping in a reeling.
[3:56:59.920 --> 3:57:05.920]  You can't do it in a state of war and terror.
[3:57:05.920 --> 3:57:10.920]  We need peace and we the people can make it happen.
[3:57:10.920 --> 3:57:17.920]  But I promise I won't talk about it again because a international media doesn't talk about international peace day.
[3:57:17.920 --> 3:57:19.920]  Why should I?
[3:57:19.920 --> 3:57:22.920]  So thank you for tuning in.
[3:57:22.920 --> 3:57:37.920]  Be back next week and support Alex Jones and Info by those products.
