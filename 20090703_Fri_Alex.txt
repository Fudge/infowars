[00:42.000 --> 00:49.000]  edition I am engaged in something that is extremely al-Qaeda I am going to talk
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  about the Bill of Rights the Constitution the Declaration of Independence
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  the Second Amendment the First Amendment the Tenth Amendment the Ninth
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  Amendment the Fourth the Fifth all of which is under attack and according to
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.000]  Homeland Security and the DHS report returning veterans gun owners conservatives
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  libertarians those that make frequent references to the US Constitution we
[01:10.000 --> 01:17.000]  are the terrorist so remember that today that the people running the federal
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  government are controlled by offshore private banks that a private corporate
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  takeover is ongoing inside the United States and worldwide right now and
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  that we're right back in the same position we were in 1774 1775 and
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000]  leading in the 1776 where the tyrants the command and the controllers who are
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  saying they have the divine right of kings and are above the law are telling
[01:40.000 --> 01:47.000]  us we are their slaves I'm also doing something really radical and something
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.000]  that SWAT teams rage you for and I'm doing it right now on air I'm not taking

[02:11.000 --> 02:19.000]  from a farm in Georgetown I am drinking raw milk not pasteurized milk that has
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  been boiled and cooked so that feces can be in it and blood and pus from the
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  overworked cows I'm drinking old-fashioned milk like humans have drank for 10
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  plus thousand years tens of thousands of years and SWAT teams are rating the
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  farmers and ranchers they are rating people selling eggs in the on the highway
[02:39.000 --> 02:46.000]  and watermelons and so I'm here engaging in a hard core crime in the land of the
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  free the home of the brave I am drinking milk so I just want to admit the
[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  criminality here on air ladies and gentlemen and we may have police SWAT
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  teaming us any minute they're probably getting an arrest warrant right now
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  there he's admitting give us the warrant he's on air admitting he's drinking
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.000]  milk hold on it's actually milk in my coffee right now I had a big oh actually

[08:10.000 --> 08:25.000]  radio network
[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  well the fourth of July is tomorrow 230 plus years of our constitutional
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  Republican who can doubt that if you read the Declaration of Independence
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  Bill of Rights Constitution the fact is the foundations of what this country was
[08:39.000 --> 08:46.000]  founded on what liberty and freedom is all about is under attack the criminal
[08:46.000 --> 08:52.000]  corrupt illegitimate government that is in control is openly waging war
[08:52.000 --> 09:01.000]  against our liberties and our freedoms and so today we are going to take
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  hundreds of your phone calls I don't care how what a good point you've got
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  what amazing breaking news you've got how key the information is because that's
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  the problem it's a cash 22 your calls are important they are informative they
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  do bring up important points it needs to be discussed but then I'll end up
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.000]  taking five six seven calls in an hour if I'm lucky I have before you can
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  probably count it on two hands taken hundreds of calls in a show when I
[09:29.000 --> 09:34.000]  control myself and go to your calls we do have the customary financial update
[09:34.000 --> 09:41.000]  coming out in the next hour with Bob Chapman I do have huge stacks of
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.000]  important news that I will go over today but the wild card nature of taking
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  your calls the different angles the different directions the different
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.000]  points that you bring up we don't screen your call so that means we get drunk
[09:55.000 --> 10:00.000]  people calling in sometimes who just want to hear themselves talk but
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.000]  sometimes we have amazing callers bringing up in very insightful points
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  folks bringing up a local news stories that you would never hear about
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  nationally the good the bad and the ugly that's what happens when you don't
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  screen calls you just ask what's your first name where you're calling from
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  we don't screen calls unless we have a specific guest on say about euthanizing
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  old people in hospitals then we'd like your calls on that or if we're talking
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  about military personnel being given orders to prepare to wage war on the
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  American people under North come then occasionally we say we like to hear from
[10:33.000 --> 10:38.000]  military but that's maybe once a week generally we have wide open phones we
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  don't screen your calls you can call in about whatever you'd like and today is
[10:42.000 --> 10:50.000]  one of those days 1-800-259-9231 in fact I'm not even going to get into the
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  stack of incredibly important news I've got in front of me I'll cover that at
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  the bottom of the hour let's take 15 calls from between now and the bottom
[11:00.000 --> 11:10.000]  of the hour in t-minus 20 minutes rich in Ohio go ahead that's exciting boom
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  that's hit me and hit me hard go ahead rich Alex this is rich in Ohio hey I
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.000]  got some great news from the Buckeye state the Ohio Senate passed a resolution
[11:21.000 --> 11:27.000]  to block cap and trade in the state of Ohio it passed on Monday by a 20 to 11
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  vote we have one heck of a fight coming up in the House of Representatives
[11:31.000 --> 11:44.000]  however and also the Ohio sovereignty movement HCR 11 and Senate concurrent
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  resolution 13 I may have the numbers backwards there
[11:47.000 --> 11:54.000]  www.ohiofreestate.com all the up-to-date information is there we need your
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.000]  signatures we're having a huge rally on August 1st in Columbus at the State
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  House keep up the great work Alex we're behind you all the way buddy
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  God bless you rich now what I'm gonna do is when I take a call and make a good
[12:07.000 --> 12:13.000]  point I'm gonna make myself today it's all about Alex Jones learning some
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  control in a lot of respects 10 years ago I handled the radio show better in
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  that I programmed it by programming that just means in the sense of radio I
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  said I'm gonna talk about this for this 15 minutes I'm gonna talk about that for
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.000]  10 minutes I'm gonna take calls then I'm gonna let the callers talk and then
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  I'm gonna throw out a quick comment and move on here's my quick comment on
[12:33.000 --> 12:40.000]  that Arizona just passed a law yesterday and I'm pulling up the story I believe
[12:40.000 --> 12:43.000]  it's waiting on the governor's signature saying we're not gonna comply with
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.000]  any cap and trade laws here in the state level from the feds or from the
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.000]  state and yes I did see that Ohio was about to pass it so I guess that's
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  already happened so a lot of victories we've also got news coming in at the
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  end of the show today that big defeat for the NAFTA superhighway at meetings
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  yesterday in Texas so we'll be breaking that down as well let's go back to
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.000]  your calls Daniel in New Jersey Daniel you're on the air
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  I actually love the show
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  thank you
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  let me just say something I am a high school student I am very much inspired by
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  Robert Weineck and what he's trying to do I'm trying to do stuff like that
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  trying to get people to um to really break from the input will not
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  during the info war you know trying to get out your DVDs and stuff like that
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  and what I must say though is to everyone the double thing that we've got in this
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  country it's sick I mean a couple years ago I you know had I heard about the 9-11
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  shooting and I was like no I really don't know that's rubbish and stuff like that
[13:46.000 --> 13:51.000]  but my uncle who is really into this movement he's you know into the
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.000]  conspiracy you know the conspiracy of the Kennedy assassination especially he
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  just broke that double thing by saying well how do you explain the guy sitting
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  next to Kennedy had more um had more scrap metal in his wrist than what
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  had been missing from the magic bullet in that
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  broke the double thing it was amazing but what I would like to ask is Alex
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  Jones how do you think we can really effectively just break the double
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  thing stranglehold that we have on our society because I mean I've told people
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  you know facts about you know the burning temperature of Jeffrey running the
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  temperature that was inside the world papers and they look at me for a second
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  like that makes sense but it can't be true how do you think we can break the double
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  thing let me answer your question good call bad phone and that's another problem
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  with not screening calls normally a phone that bad wouldn't get on the radio
[14:39.000 --> 14:47.000]  but we'd rather you hear what they have to say okay here's the issue there's a
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  lot of different angles to this and I can spend five hours on it but I want to
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  take your calls so I'm not going to people have to get raped and abused and
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.000]  hurt and have empty stomachs first before they stand up to tyranny now a
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  society that's experienced tyranny already they don't have to have empty
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  bellies to fight it they know how bad it is to have their children living in
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  tyranny and so they'll fight for freedom but when you have a spoiled rotten
[15:15.000 --> 15:21.000]  generations of generations living here in the United States it's very hard to
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  get them out of their selfishness of not caring about society because they
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  don't realize that what happens in society ends up affecting them they're
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  very sheltered but you just said it the Dallas Morning News what in January of
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  this year had to admit what had already been known for years but the army did
[15:39.000 --> 15:48.000]  a test out at Los Alamos and weighed the grams that had been found in the
[15:48.000 --> 15:56.000]  rest of Governor Connolly and weighed those on the supposed magic bullet and
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  it the magic bullet doesn't even have any pieces out of it and it's impossible
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.000]  it would the bullet would be half again as big as the largest 30 odd six round
[16:05.000 --> 16:11.000]  that's just one little point but any fool knows bullets don't shoot through
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.000]  four or five bones and two people and through seats and then barely have a
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.000]  bend in them that bullet was probably not even fired from a gun it was pulled
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.000]  out with pliers out of a cartridge so how do you get people to break out of
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  their double thing you go look at Madoff founder of the stock exchange Nasdaq
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  look at all the corruption look at how many times you've been lied to quit
[16:33.000 --> 16:38.000]  being a schmuck and I also wouldn't address people in kind of a I know you
[16:38.000 --> 16:43.000]  this sounds kooky but please listen to me no you got to be in charge and say
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  here are the facts here's a DVD here's an article we're getting suckered both
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  parties are controlled you know what your gut be part of history you're only
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.000]  alive once don't sit there on your butt letting all this corruption take over
[16:55.000 --> 17:00.000]  the only chance we've got is to audit the Fed and arrest the bankers
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.000]  let's talk to Lee in Tennessee Lee you're on the air hey I just wanted to call
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.000]  until you think Alex from a Christian from an intellectual standpoint from
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.000]  somebody here in the thick of it here in Memphis like I just wanted to tell you

[17:17.000 --> 17:21.000]  and in this battle no matter what the New World Order tries to do to rearrange
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.000]  our thoughts and to rearrange our lives and to take away our freedom nature
[17:25.000 --> 17:30.000]  will have a way of taking care of itself and we all will ascend beyond this
[17:30.000 --> 17:36.000]  physical glove and reach heaven on earth because that is our destiny as human
[17:36.000 --> 17:43.000]  citizens of confederation millions of light years away citizens of heaven here
[17:43.000 --> 17:48.000]  on earth I thank you because you are doing something you are spreading the

[24:59.000 --> 25:03.000]  okay going back to Jordan in California
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.000]  talking about how he just formed a we are change you can call it an
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.000]  info wars group a tyranny response team a tea party
[25:11.000 --> 25:15.000]  we are change it's good to have lots of different diverse groups
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  and names and organizations people always email me and call me and
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  ask me and they say this we are change groups said this or this we are change
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  groups said that or this 9-11 truth you said this or that Alex you're
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  the founder of 9-11 truth Alex you were the first guy to talk about it and the
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  first guy to go on air day one and so we got to form groups to go around and get the truth out
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.000]  you know you need to answer for what this group said or what that group
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  did there is no leadership that's what makes us unstoppable
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  is that it's ideas it's political action it's getting
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  involved and I'm not the leader of any of this
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  I'm just a fire starter and when I tell folks over and over again
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  is just step up it's like field of dreams
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  build it and they will come and you're not going to be perfect
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.000]  when you first stand up and speak I remember being
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  20 years old two years before I got on air in
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.000]  1995 it was 1994
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.000]  I may have been 19 years
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.000]  and I remember going to city council and county commissioners meetings and fighting
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.000]  SOS using water runoff
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  water aquifer rules to steal everybody's
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  property in Austin had nothing to do with the environment nothing to do with water
[26:35.000 --> 26:39.000]  sounded reasonable had a bunch of environmentalists get behind it because they
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  didn't want to ruin the beautiful creeks and streams but that's not what ended up happening was about
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.000]  stealing the property and now they've built all over it
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.000]  it was about not even giving people fair market value
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.000]  and that's when I really first got involved and boy that was just the opening to the rabbit hole
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  I've gone down hundreds of levels now
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  the issue is I went and started an access TV show and I went and started doing a radio show
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  and I built it and they came and so that's what
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  Jordan was just starting to say as we hit the break that's why I held him over
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.000]  is because step up start an organization don't worry about infiltration
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  folks there's so many groups and organizations now they can't infiltrate us all and you'll
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  know an infiltrator you start getting a group of 1020 3040 people for the second
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.000]  amendment or sovereignty or water rights or land rights or
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  anti-neural order and you'll suddenly have somebody show up
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  who pulls you aside and says let's go knife the tires of police
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  cars and you need to say okay I know you're a cop pull a camera
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  out start recording their face and put it on YouTube and then they will avoid
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  you like the black plague you tell them I'm an American
[27:47.000 --> 27:51.000]  citizen under the first amendment state police or FBI
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.000]  and I have a right and I know you got a federal grant to do this
[27:55.000 --> 27:59.000]  shame on you why don't you investigate all the criminal bankers you work for
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.000]  and you put their ugly face on YouTube you put the light
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  in these vampires faces and you drive them back they're trying to act like
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  we're bad we're the terrorists we're evil they're trying to demonize us in reports
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.000]  let's show the world who they are
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.000]  so you start your own groups and get past your fear okay you got about a minute and a half before we
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  break I'm gonna come back and blitz three more calls but go ahead Jordan finish your point about
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  we are change up there in Fresno. Alright Alex everything
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  you just said is what's happening in our local area you know we just formed this
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  group and people come out of the woodwork there are tons of people
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  out there that are just waiting for you or for anybody
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  out there that's in your town that has not formed a group form one
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  that people will flock to you people will find you people are searching
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  on the internet for groups and you know start taking action
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  it's amazing you don't have to have all the answers
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  tons of people will come to help and
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  yeah we did have on after we had a few meetings and we
[29:03.000 --> 29:07.000]  hosted Richard Gage and we were started
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.000]  you know fighting back and all in positive ways we did have
[29:11.000 --> 29:15.000]  one bizarre individual who my radar went in on
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.000]  and he did start saying yeah we need to start shooting people we need to start
[29:19.000 --> 29:23.000]  graffitiing and it was so obvious that he in my
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.000]  mind at least he was an agent and my wife was there and she decided to
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  confront him afterwards and so I got involved
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  with that too and it was very apparent
[29:35.000 --> 29:39.000]  basically without admitting admitted he was
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  an agent of who I don't know what FBI I have no idea but they're an agent of the New World Order
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  to make sure the foreign bankers get to bring us down they are enemies of the
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.000]  republic and they must be dealt with right back

[34:39.000 --> 34:43.000]  in the final phases of converting the entire government into a crime syndicate
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.000]  every county every city in the country
[34:47.000 --> 34:51.000]  has corrupt police on the force
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.000]  the majority of counties in texas rob motorist
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  I've been telling you this for over a decade now it's mainstream news
[34:59.000 --> 35:03.000]  and these towns are full of nice people hard work and christian people
[35:03.000 --> 35:07.000]  believe me that's where I'm from and you'll have one police force

[35:15.000 --> 35:19.000]  criminals or vice versa where the county isn't criminal but then the city's
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.000]  criminal there's counties from alabama to texas to
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.000]  california where they kill good sheriffs deputies
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  sheriffs deputies kill sheriffs deputies sheriffs deputies kill sheriffs
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  sheriffs deputies kill good police officers it's a
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  war and I see this stuff every week where they're killing cops it's cops
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  killing cops just like serpico
[35:43.000 --> 35:47.000]  in new york go rent that movie and watch it it's
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  a true story oh you won't take drug money we'll just shoot you in the face pal
[35:51.000 --> 35:55.000]  and he had to move to sweatshirtland because the new york cops were trying to hunt him
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.000]  down and kill him and they had to fire over serpico
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  I've had the famous detectives on that worked with him
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.000]  don't try to get serpico on but I've had some of the other famous new york detectives they had to fire in that
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.000]  round 74 percent of the detectives
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.000]  74 percent
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  it's kind of like an office manager who's corrupt or
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  a corporate culture that's gone bad they just tell you fire everybody
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  or the majority of people that's what's happened with the government it's like
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  a corrupt church board or a corrupt corporation or anything it goes
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  bad you can count on one hand
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  there are societies that could be called somewhat free
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  a few of the greek city states maybe
[36:43.000 --> 36:47.000]  somewhat free compared to other counterparts in that history going back
[36:47.000 --> 36:51.000]  2,500 years ago 3,000 a couple city
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  states in greece and then sweatshirtland and the netherlands
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  and the united states that's where the pilgrims went to get freedom was
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  hanging out with the dutch
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.000]  we have a freedom come from the mosaic law
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  with an amalgamation of germanic law and then the dutch system
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  mixed with the british magnacarta common law
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  very very special we're going to be talking about that in the
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  last hour today with a special guest
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.000]  but look here's the type of news headlines I have in front of me south africans
[37:27.000 --> 37:31.000]  must register cell phone sim cards saying things now happening in mexico now they want
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  it in canada and the u.s.
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.000]  Norway has 23 cases of h1n1 decides to vaccinate an entire population
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.000]  Norway is now starting a forced inoculation program of 9.4 million
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  and then meanwhile they say they're getting
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  ready for it here in the united states forced inoculation
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  and that dovetails with these fear
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.000]  mongering stories out of roiders 1 million americans infected with the
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  swine flu preparing for forced inoculation
[38:03.000 --> 38:07.000]  britain saying we may have a large portion of our population
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.000]  die and it's killed one person in england that's the headline
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.000]  first death in england government prepares to forcibly inoculate
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  oh my gosh let's give up all of our rights and all of our freedoms one person has died
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  teen in swine flu's first victim in london as ministers
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  warn 40 a day could die by end of summer
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.000]  i mean is this the biggest hoax in history or is it something bigger you see
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  that's why i freaked out so bad when this first happened back in april
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.000]  i came on air and i think
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.000]  everybody should go to youtube and watch that saturday night when the story was two days old
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  that's saturday night two hour report i did
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  commercial free prison planet dot tv only
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  it's on prison planet dot tv
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  but it's also the alex jones channel on youtube and other places but it's live at prisonplanet.tv
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  i went on air and i had said
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  two months before and we've since played that on air i said i believe that their
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  card they're ready to play next in stage terror
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  isn't nukes going off isn't al-qaeda truck bombs
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  or hijacking jets isn't even a new war
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  in iran or pakistan or on the borders of russia
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  i also satia and abkhazia and georgia and the disputed
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.000]  demilitarized zone zones plural
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  i said on record
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.000]  on the march 5th show and on many others
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.000]  i said i see them playing a flu hysteria card
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  and i went further
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  you know i don't have the staff to do it half my staff is gone right now to an interview
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  the new film i got part of my crew out of the country right now interviewing people
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  not going to announce that till they're back
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.000]  i don't have the people i'm asking listeners to go to the march 5th and march
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  10th and other shows i did where i broke down that they were going to stage flu
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  and then edit that together with my
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  that saturday night when it all first broke out in april a month later
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  because that's what convinces the public
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  to ask how do you break the ice how do you break their cognitive dissonance
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.000]  how do you break their conditioning how do you get them to look at the facts
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  revelation if you can tell somebody something before it
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  happens and it happens with precision like you
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  said they'll pay attention to you even the dumbest yuppie will
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.000]  but i don't have the staff
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.000]  to get all those video clips and edit them together it's all posted at the alex jones youtube channel
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.000]  alex jones channel go get it edited together it's all posted
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.000]  in high quality at prismplanet.tv
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  only because then people will listen to us even more
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.000]  all the shows i did leading up to 9-11
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.000]  saying they're going to blow up the world trade center and blame it on their asset bin laden
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.000]  the radio shows the tv shows millions of views online wakes people up big
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.000]  time gets the feds hopping man
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  i could see what they were about to do from their propaganda on tv
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  alone and other people could
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  i'm going to go to your calls here in a moment
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  the point is
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  that i went on air and i said this is either a scion
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.000]  to train the county cities and states and other regional
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  units of government in other nations as well
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.000]  and i said this is a complete hoax
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  but regardless it signifies something real
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.000]  because i was getting hospital documents and state documents
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.000]  that we were really at a level 5
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.000]  and i said this is a complete hoax
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  but regardless it signifies something real
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  because i was getting hospital documents
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  that we were really at a level 5 and about to go to a level 6
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  and the public wasn't being told you notice now it came out months later that's exactly what happened
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.000]  those were real documents i know the city official personally
[42:23.000 --> 42:27.000]  i got it from i'll just leave it at that very close
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.000]  to them
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.000]  but that was when it was already happening months before
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  and then in early march again i went on air and i said
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  with all the preparation in the baxter mixing
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  weaponized bird flu
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.000]  in with
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  regular flu season stuff in 12 countries
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  was it 14 countries in europe and then all these homeless dying
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.000]  in a separate secret bird flu trial
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  don't believe me just google death from bird flu trial europe
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.000]  arrested but not the pharmaceutical companies the city officials
[43:11.000 --> 43:15.000]  that went out and shot people up at government clinics have been arrested for giving them
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  an illegal experimental vaccine to see if it'd kill them
[43:19.000 --> 43:23.000]  london telegraph roiders afp french news agency
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  agency friends press
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  just gave you sources so i saw them hyping and i saw the grid
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  i saw the mass grave documents out of new york and out of indiana
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  chicago i had emergency managers on i had reporters on
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  i knew they were doing drills all over delivering flu vaccine for marcia
[43:43.000 --> 43:47.000]  law in the upcoming fall this is back in march i'm saying this
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.000]  then you have them launch the drill the fear mongering
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  less than 50 deaths worldwide and now they're saying a million have it in the us
[43:55.000 --> 43:59.000]  well it's nine days yeah a million have been infected there's thousands
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.000]  of different flu viruses going around they're not sick they're not dying
[44:03.000 --> 44:07.000]  why then are they doing this well it's a cover for marcia law it's a cover
[44:07.000 --> 44:11.000]  for federalization right when they try to pass the total federal reserve takeover
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.000]  of all economic systems in the united states
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  right when they prepare
[44:23.000 --> 44:27.000]  to take over
[44:27.000 --> 44:31.000]  with the water bill to federalize all water above
[44:31.000 --> 44:35.000]  and below ground all land in the united states
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  the water clean water restoration act
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  more like the total federalization united states is going into
[44:43.000 --> 44:47.000]  receivership to offshore fraudulent banks act a bunch of made off type criminals
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.000]  their gun control
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.000]  bills their forced youth brigade bills their national draft
[44:55.000 --> 44:59.000]  bills their blanket amnesty bills their socialized health care bills it's
[44:59.000 --> 45:03.000]  happening right now their hate crime free speech destroying bills
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.000]  it's all happening now and just like in mexico
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.000]  was passing a bunch of police state laws and the people were on the edge of revolting
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.000]  and it was clear that called around and still on the election suddenly they get hit
[45:15.000 --> 45:19.000]  and the government gets to lock down they were testing it in mexico to see if
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.000]  they can do it in other countries when they have the full takeover in the fall
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.000]  now if we get the word out and speak out and expose these people they may not be able
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.000]  to do it they don't even need people to die in the fall or they'll release some new
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.000]  variant mutation of this that is a little bit worse if the regular flu
[45:35.000 --> 45:39.000]  kills 37,000 people according to the federal government every year in the
[45:39.000 --> 45:43.000]  US if this thing kills a thousand they'll act like it's the end
[45:43.000 --> 45:47.000]  of civilization regular flu kills over 30,000
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  this thing's killed what five people in the US and they acted like
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  it was the end of America what if it kills a thousand what if it
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  kills 30,000 ladies and gentlemen I can see
[45:59.000 --> 46:03.000]  them with their preparatory phases
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.000]  it's like if you're a football fan of a certain coach and a team and you see them go into a certain
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.000]  formation you know okay they're about to run this it isn't hard ladies
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.000]  and gentlemen you're a fan of basketball
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  and you see a certain formation or you're a fan of baseball
[46:19.000 --> 46:23.000]  and a certain hitter gets up there and he always you know swings for the bleachers
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  goes all the way you know what's going to happen ladies and gentlemen
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.000]  again I was saying and I've said and I predicted
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.000]  it and then it happened and I said it's either a total
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.000]  drill for martial law or this could be yet because they've always been
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.000]  preparing and getting ready for that either way it's the same
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.000]  outcome alright let's go to your phone calls here

[47:15.000 --> 47:19.000]  she spoke about what's wrong with the country what's wrong with the nation there were
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.000]  people there that were supporting her Christians you know she's a wonderful
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.000]  Christian Alcatraz were there okay oh there is a bunch of
[47:27.000 --> 47:31.000]  you know gays and lesbians and stuff there haranguing her you know they
[47:31.000 --> 47:35.000]  speak they want to preach power power you know free speech
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.000]  you know it's okay to urinate on the flag or on an epit of
[47:39.000 --> 47:43.000]  Christ or whatever you can do oh that's free speech you know pooping
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  on something you know whatever all that nonsense weird stuff but as soon as
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  you mention you know you want to you know
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  you're you know you want to say your free speech you know your rights
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.000]  or whatever whenever you want to say something it's like oh we don't want you know they just
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  no it is true that at least it is true sir and I appreciate
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  your call John that the left as it's known
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  has introduced bills and passed one out of the house to completely in the first
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  amendment the hate crimes act it actually says have you heard somebody's feelings you're arrested
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  jail it's passed the house and HBO has all these shows
[48:19.000 --> 48:23.000]  about the right wing trying to take the left's rights but see that's how it
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.000]  works the right is ready to take the left's rights and the right is ready to
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  the right is ready to take the left's rights and the left is ready to take the right's rights
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  and then nobody has any rights left and so yes
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  the left does hate the first amendment
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  unless it's pooping on it on the flag and they do do that
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.000]  and they have the government fund it then they tell conservatives oh you're trying to restrict
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.000]  my free speech because you don't want me to sell cans of crap
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  in spinach cans that that's a real case and paid $50,000
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.000]  per can of 50 and then the government puts it on display and you and you pay
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.000]  for that we shouldn't have to pay for a painting
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  of a beautiful field of roses or for a can of crap
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  I mean I saw the Austin police department paid
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  $244,000 for a
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.000]  tiny fountain that
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.000]  mounts on the wall at their shooting range and it said it's meant to cool and
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.000]  soothe them and all that is another form of
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  government pay off that's always connected to people married to the mayor or married to the
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.000]  city council people it's ridiculous I mean they put up all these blue
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.000]  posters that cost I think it was $10 million or something a few years ago
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  and like a million bucks a year to upkeep them blue posters blue things
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  that stick out on the road sides everywhere
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  it's just all part of government scamming you know they'll they'll they'll run an old person
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.000]  out of their house for three inch grass $2,000 a day fines
[49:55.000 --> 49:59.000]  and they'll take those $2,000 a day fines and and you know pay $10 million
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.000]  to some to some guy to urinate all over the cross I mean yeah that's
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  how it works but again you want to say that's art that's fine
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.000]  don't make me pay for it I don't want to pay for any of it I don't want to pay for government
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.000]  statues you know used to people would an endowment
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  a rich person would pay to have it done and give it to the city but not anymore
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  we don't have beautiful Greek statues anymore we have cans
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  of urine and feces that's the beautiful art let's talk to

[55:37.000 --> 55:41.000]  let's go to Gordon in New Mexico go ahead Gordon
[55:41.000 --> 55:45.000]  Hi Alex how's it going
[55:45.000 --> 55:49.000]  I've been aware and awake about the shadow government and what's been going on in our
[55:49.000 --> 55:53.000]  country for several years I'd like to give credit for that to a
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.000]  book written in 1991 by a doctor Gary Cock called
[55:57.000 --> 56:01.000]  in route to global occupation and breaks everything down including predicting 9-11
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.000]  and now it is excellent and again
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  we all stand on the shoulders of people like the good doctor that have broken all this down
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.000]  yes sir and recently my attention like a lot of us
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.000]  have been on the camps and the trains and it got me
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  thinking here in New Mexico the biggest project
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  government project is a $385 million
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.000]  train massive transit system that researchers have proven
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  not only is not needed but will never pay for itself further
[56:33.000 --> 56:37.000]  research of mine has shown where do you think this train is heading
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  directly to the one known FEMA camp in New
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.000]  Mexico so it's a very
[56:45.000 --> 56:49.000]  I realize it's a very crucial step here in New Mexico for the
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.000]  open areas and I appreciate your call the government has its open
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.000]  FEMA camps all over the country and the
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  government system and they admit they've built them and they have the civilian inmate labor camp
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  program run by the army that's associated press world net daily
[57:05.000 --> 57:09.000]  years after we broke it they report on it Glenn Beck and people do strong
[57:09.000 --> 57:13.000]  men they only go report on camps that have already been disproven or or real camps
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.000]  so that's a little trick they play thank you Gordon Ricky in Rhode Island
[57:17.000 --> 57:21.000]  Ricky go ahead how you doing Alex good
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.000]  it's a I'm gonna stop by saying thanks like everybody else because you
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  woke me up probably about eight months ago and since then I've been into
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.000]  stuff and trying to find out as much as I can like you so
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.000]  good job brother I know you had David like on not very long ago
[57:37.000 --> 57:41.000]  and I was wondering if I don't know if it's really his
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.000]  movie or if people just labeled it as him online but it was a no plane
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.000]  theory for September 11th
[57:49.000 --> 57:53.000]  I don't really get into all that stuff because that can't be proven one way or the other and I appreciate
[57:53.000 --> 57:57.000]  your call I mean I can't even hardly keep track of all the
[57:57.000 --> 58:01.000]  videos and films and that are out there that people put me in
[58:01.000 --> 58:05.000]  so I can't really comment on it sir take
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.000]  a lot of Christians got mad at me because it misrepresents
[58:09.000 --> 58:13.000]  Christians and the faith and even get some major gods wrong
[58:13.000 --> 58:17.000]  that predate Christianity and then they
[58:17.000 --> 58:21.000]  used a bunch of my clips and zeitgeist later in the 9-11 section so people
[58:21.000 --> 58:25.000]  thought that was my film that was not my film I'll assure you
[58:25.000 --> 58:29.000]  so I'll let David speak for himself on things I don't know what you speak of
[58:29.000 --> 58:33.000]  and again I can't be my brother's keeper okay we have David
[58:33.000 --> 58:37.000]  he's an icon because he's an icon and that's why we have him on

[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  francophobe thing instead of being a francophile and we're these Anglophiles
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  in this country now I got an English last name Jones Welch and I
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  love the British people they're great folks but let's not hate the French on 4th of July
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  contrary to what they brainwashed people the French helped found this country
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  now I know in the brainwash neocon world or Barack Obama's world loving
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  the United States the Bill of Rights the Constitution is bad that's why with the homeland security documents
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  that we broke the Mayak report and the DHS reports
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  we broke those folks others took credit for it but that's fine
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  gun owners veterans conservatives libertarians we are the terrorist
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  now because the foreign offshore banks that have hijacked
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  the United States they are the real terrorists ladies and gentlemen
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  and we're here to fight them and to expose them we're going to have open phones
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  throughout the next three hours
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  to discuss how liberties being trampled on how our freedoms are being destroyed
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  how we're going from land of the free home of the brave to land of
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  the cowards home of the slaves and how do we get that freedom
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  and liberty back I want to go through a bunch of news items that are examples of this but first
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  we need to get into the economy deteriorating by design
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  the globalist are on record engineering that and we always have Bob Chapman joining us
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  in the second hour on Fridays he is a former the biggest
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  private golden silver broker out there at one time had the biggest newsletter back
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  during the 1980s retired for a while came back with the international forecaster
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  was also military intelligence and he's been fighting the new world war and the globalist
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  and the private fellow reserve for more than 45 years Bob Chapman good to
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  have you here with us today on the economy and a lot more
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  as we race towards the anniversary of the birth of this country
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  it's terrific I love being here
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  we're about to break about a minute and a half Bob but tell us some of the most important
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  latest financial news that you're going to be covering on the other side of this break
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  well I think one of the things that we have to take notice of is
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  the made off affair and how it's turned out and of course
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  150 years to made off which is ridiculous but the key
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  to this whole thing and I've been told by
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  my sources that it was a CIA Mossad operation in
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  conjunction with made off went on for many years none of the money ever
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  went to made off and went in one door and out the other and by the way you were the first
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  to say that three or four months ago now that's leaked out a few places
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  in mainstream media that obviously he didn't act alone this was a money laundering
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  operation and that's correct it wasn't actually in December
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  before it happened and but anyway the key to this
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  whole thing is the Federal Reserve in New York
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  and the Fed overall and the US Treasury
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  have copies of every wire that made
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  off sent to offshore destinations most of the money
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  went to Israel stay there and I want you to recap all that
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  and Bob Chapman on the other side will look at the entire economy
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  the jobless rates the inflation rate where you see the economy going
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  but first we'll cover made off in the money laundering scam that dwarfs
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  even Enron it's all coming up we'll talk about the carbon
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  tax passing the House Senator Kerry says it's going to pass the Senate
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  the home inspections are already beginning but the states are fighting back
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  Hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important to be

[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  on XCM radio five to eight p.m.

[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  speaking of all over the map we have calls from England Australia
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  Washington DC California Ohio
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  you name it one time I even got a call from
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  McMurtle weather station in Antarctica on the bottom of the planet maybe we'll get one of those
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  calls today toll free number to join us 1-800-259-9231
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  I know we've got a lot of new affiliates across
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  the country and I know that we have a lot
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  of new listeners so let me just explain to people I'm not a left winger I'm not a right winger
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  I'm a constitutionalist they didn't have left wing and right wing
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  in the days of 1776 when this country was founded it was
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  are you for big government or small government are you for free market or a king
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  do you like being controlled or do you want freedom are you for keeping and bearing
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  arms and not being a slave or do you want to be an indentured servant
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  to me it's a question of slavery versus abolition
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  of slavery I have sworn as Thomas Jefferson did
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  eternal resistance against all forms of tyranny over
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  man in the minds of man and I'm here to light bushfires in the minds
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  of men and women everywhere I have a special guest in the last hour today constitutional scholar
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  a historian about what our founders went through so that's coming up
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  but for the next 20 minutes or so I want to go over the economy with Bob Chapman
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  the international forecaster dot com again our websites info wars dot com
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  Bob did in his newsletter actually back in December before Madoff even
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  got in trouble he said Madoff and others are involved in these
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  rams there's no way they're actually making 15% every year and you know never
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  having problems Madoff was founder of the Nasdaq
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  it's Madoff criminals that basically run Wall Street CIA was
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  set up by them they're now feeding what's left of the free market economy into it
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  14.8 trillion has been stolen they own both parties
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  they don't want HR 1207 to pass it's right up at
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  250 cosponsors right now in the house to audit the Federal Reserve that says it's
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  above the law in all branches of government how asinine is that
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  and so we're going to get into Madoff getting 150 years saying he
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  ran it all himself when the promise software and what the NSA does
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  they admit there's a record through the securities and exchange commission of all this
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  so what's really behind the Madoff scam from the man who first
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  said that Madoff was going to go down and that Madoff was an operative
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  and it was a massage slash CIA op so
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  tell us what's happening there first
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  what I was trying to get to was that
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  because some stations don't carry that first segment a recap
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  what I was getting into is that the Fed and the Federal Reserve
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  in New York as well as in Washington and the US Treasury track every wire
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  so they know where
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  all the money went from what banks to what place
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  foreign offshore accounts they know that they know who owned them
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  so they know who did what and there's no question
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  now none of this has come out I mean these people
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  who are rigging this whole thing and throwing all the blame on
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  Madoff they got to be dumb I mean we're not
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  that stupid I mean that's a simple thing that they do
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  every day so they know who did what
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  and they know who was involved
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  I believe that probably
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  Mr. Madoff will die within two years perhaps even
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  six months but I don't think he'll die
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  I think they'll tell you he died and he'll be shipped out someplace
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  that's what I think they're up to with him well that's the same thing with the witness protection
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  program they do this all the time and even mainstream newspapers
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  have reported in Latin America and Europe that Ken Lay is down in Paraguay
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  where the Bushes bought those giant 50 plus thousand acre
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  ranches this is what black ops do continually they take low level special
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  forces operatives by the thousands each year and stage their death
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  that's on record so to say they wouldn't stage a Ken Lay or a Madoff's
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  death later or like a Jack Ruby I mean we know they do this
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  you're right and we have contacts in Montevideo
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  who have told us the same thing so
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  and you know you have to know what to look for and these people do
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  you were in black ops in South Africa Germany France and a bunch of other
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  unnamed countries were they staging deaths back in the 50s then when you were in
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  not that I know of
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  I might interject here I'm glad they passed me over
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  for MKUltra
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  every time I think about that I say to myself my goodness gracious
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  you know there but for the grace of God go I
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  well the LA Times reported that Theodore Kaczynski the unabomber was CIA
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  and volunteered for MKUltra so good thing they did pass you over Bob
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  but continue so explain
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  I have the Associated Press reporting here
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  that 171 billion not 50 we've been saying
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  over 100 171 billion has disappeared
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  that's what Madoff really stole and that now they've put out a
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  Asset Forfeiture Seizure notice for 171 billion
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  so why are they telling us 50 billion but now it's 171 billion
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  it's part of the cover up and they'll dance
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  around and do all of it with what they've got to do and they're going to cover it up
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  this is just like the BCCI scandal
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  which was an operation that was run by
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  the Central Intelligence Agency as well as the
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  Nugent Hand Program and if you remember one of them
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  most say it was Nugent he committed suicide he shot himself in the back of the head
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  and so that's the way these things end up and the other fellow
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  ended up in jail and I don't know whether he's still there or not
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  but you know he was protesting all he was doing was what the government told
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  me to do and of course nobody wanted to listen and nobody cared
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  but this is not a Ponzi scheme this
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  made off affair this was a criminal scam
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  the money went into the company and out the back door
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  so to speak it went to the Israeli Discount Bank, City Group
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  Bank Lumi and off to
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  offshore destinations and then I think
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  knowing made the mind of made off because I
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  was in that business for 28 years I think they probably
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  brought the money back into other accounts in the United States
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  to play the market and of course they're loaded with inside
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  information so who knows how much money the
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  $171 billion made I mean it may be worth $5 trillion
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  for all we know
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  and of course for those that don't know Bob give them the technical name
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  for the plunge protection team since the 1980s
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  that goes in with billions every day to drive it down, prop it up
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  so for the insiders at the top of the pyramid
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  at the paramount level it's all a giant casino rigged for them
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  and so we hear that they've destroyed half the stock market's value
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  stolen the police and firemen and teachers retirement the private citizens
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  the wealth wasn't destroyed it was fenced just like
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  Enron was just a dummy corporation they took the money out the back door
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  then they blew it out when they were ready people need to understand that these
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  controlled recessions and depressions these booms and busts
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  are engineered to consolidate power with vertical integration
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  well Ronald Reagan
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  after the collapse in the market in
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  October the 19th 1987 was convinced
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  that we had to do something about this and we can't let this sort of thing
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  happen again and so we need something to protect the
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  markets in the event of emergency and he signed and it became
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  final as an executive order in August of 1988
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  the working group in financial markets and
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  its structure is the chairman of the Fed
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  head of the Treasury Department the head of the New York
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  Fed the head of the Securities Exchange Commission
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  and the head of the CFTC
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  Commodity Futures Trading Corporation the last two of government agencies
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  for those of you who don't know and what they do
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  is they have groups of people
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  all over the world and they enter into markets
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  all over the world 24-7 and
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  they're using money that's been created out of thin air
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  they're using treasury funds which is one of their subsidiary funds
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  and they continue
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  to make the market do what they want it to do
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  a good example is what's going on right now and they fostered and created
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  the rally in the down jose industrial average from 6600 to
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  8700 we know that they do that and we predicted
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  it although we didn't predict 8700 we predicted 8500
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  so we weren't completely right but we were close
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  and they are keeping the market up by going in
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  and rigging the market they're doing the same thing
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  with the currencies and the commodities gold and silver if you watch
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  almost every Monday morning the market is up 50 or 100 points
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  maybe more and the dollar is strong
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  and commodities are down and gold and silver are down
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  and they don't care who knows anymore they just do what they want to do
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  arrogantly and I do have in tomorrow's
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  issue of the international forecaster two tapes that I got
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  from CNBC and those two tapes
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  are conversations in one case with one person
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  and the moderator and the other case it was four people
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  and they all come to the conclusion that the market is being manipulated
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  now this is a tremendous breakthrough tremendous
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  to have this on national television
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  they have fought it for over 10 years and I've discussed it with them
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  and they said we can't put that on and just like when I started getting on it
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  getting on Fox and ABC and NBC and all that stuff
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  three or four months ago pushing Ron Paul's 1207
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  they said you can't talk about that on here
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  I want to get into this Washington Post story where they got caught selling
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  access to the president for $250,000 a person
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  total project mockingbird just absolutely criminal
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  I mean the media is so rigged folks the mainstream media

[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:20.200]  job or pay for the position. It's all kickbacks and also pay to have access to politicians
[1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:25.240]  and Politico is broken. That's why they keep getting so big, but we already knew Washington
[1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:30.660]  Post is a CIA front. That's come out from a OSS and then CIA documents in the church
[1:25:30.660 --> 1:25:36.240]  hearings and 77. It came out in 2003 that Bush was spending tens of billions a year
[1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:40.900]  to buy reporters. The media kind of minimize it. Just talking about Armstrong Williams
[1:25:40.900 --> 1:25:45.760]  to push the socialist no child left behind federalization of all education. They said,
[1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:50.900]  Oh, well, he just took 244 grand to go give a few speeches secretly saying, Hey, I'm a
[1:25:50.900 --> 1:25:56.920]  black conservative. This isn't socialism. But it turned it's CNN Fox. All these channels
[1:25:56.920 --> 1:26:02.640]  have gotten government funding on record. But here's Politico. Washington Post cancels
[1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:10.400]  lobbyist event amid uproar and they were going to pay $250,000 per media and lobbyist
[1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:17.820]  to meet at the private home of publisher Catherine Wymouth said she was canceling plans for
[1:26:17.820 --> 1:26:24.600]  exclusive salon at her home where as much as 250,000 the post offered lobbyists and
[1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:30.040]  association executives off the record access to those powerful few Obama administration
[1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:34.960]  officials members of Congress and even the paper's own reporters and editors. The astounding
[1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:40.360]  offer was detailed in a flyer circulated Wednesday to the healthcare lobbyist provided it to
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:44.480]  a reporter because the lobbyist said he thought it was a conflict for the paper. And then
[1:26:44.480 --> 1:26:48.840]  now you even have famous reporters coming out and saying Obama is more controlled than
[1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:54.720]  Richard Nixon. Helen Thomas is now saying that fact. Print me that it's on infowars.com.
[1:26:54.720 --> 1:27:00.720]  Print me that we've got a link. Print me the article. I want to show people that because
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:05.240]  because basically the inside word is this even happened as inauguration. So that's on
[1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:10.960]  record and the victory party in Chicago. You got to pay them under the table for anything.
[1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:16.520]  I mean, this is just pure mafia. Isn't it Bob Chapman? It certainly is. And it's been
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:22.120]  going on for years and years and I'm glad the post did what they did and it got exposed.
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:25.880]  It's a right. The post got caught by Politico. But I mean, you're saying you're glad they
[1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:29.560]  got caught. Yes, I'm glad they did it and I glad they
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:35.120]  got caught. So people listen to this program and other people will understand that this
[1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:41.040]  is nothing new and this is the way Washington functions. And that's not supposed to be that
[1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:47.560]  way. In fact, lobbyists should be done away with. And as far as elections are concerned,
[1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:53.360]  each congressman and each senator or person who wants to run for that office should be
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:59.480]  funded in equal amounts by the United States government. There should be no private funding.
[1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:04.840]  They start running for election two months before the election itself. And that's the
[1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:09.480]  end of it. Well, you've got all these international foreign
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:14.920]  corporations that what they have three lobbyists for every member of the Congress. Most of
[1:28:14.920 --> 1:28:21.800]  them are offshore and no wonder the Congress on every issue of open borders, gun control.
[1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:27.360]  It's all unpopular, but it just continues. We've had all these top Democrats admit quote
[1:28:27.360 --> 1:28:33.120]  the Congress is run by banks. I mean, this country is under a banking dictatorship.
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:37.040]  It's illegitimate. It's criminal. And that's why they got the feds writing homeland security
[1:28:37.040 --> 1:28:42.720]  reports saying anybody that protests the Fed is a terrorist. No, the Fed is a foreign financial
[1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:48.120]  terrorist imploding our economy by design. Explain why they want to implode the economy,
[1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:52.480]  Bob. They want to end they feel this is the only
[1:28:52.480 --> 1:28:58.440]  way to force people, particularly in America and in Europe, to accept world government.
[1:28:58.440 --> 1:29:04.600]  This is what this is all about. And if things aren't working out too well, and maybe even
[1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:09.880]  if they are, they'll have another war. And I think it'll be a large war. And I think
[1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:15.680]  it'll probably involve what one might call Western powers against Russia and China and
[1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:19.920]  maybe some others. And I think that's on the way. That's how
[1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:25.840]  they cover up all the things that they do is have another war. We predicted the event
[1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:34.080]  like 9 11 within 33 days of it happening, about 10 months, 11 months before we said
[1:29:34.080 --> 1:29:40.160]  that that would be used as an excuse to go in and attack Iraq and occupy it. Well, tell
[1:29:40.160 --> 1:29:43.960]  us more about where you see him starting a war when we get back to look at some other
[1:29:43.960 --> 1:29:51.440]  subjects on the economy and take phone calls. Long segment coming up. Stay with us. We're
[1:29:51.440 --> 1:30:01.760]  on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex

[1:31:03.400 --> 1:31:08.360]  you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation
[1:31:08.360 --> 1:31:12.680]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants
[1:31:12.680 --> 1:31:17.680]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government
[1:31:17.680 --> 1:31:22.400]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[1:31:22.400 --> 1:31:26.360]  some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with
[1:31:26.360 --> 1:31:30.360]  the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm
[1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:34.160]  season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:31:34.160 --> 1:31:38.960]  related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[1:31:38.960 --> 1:31:42.760]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[1:31:42.760 --> 1:31:50.480]  solution from science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[1:33:01.120 --> 1:33:12.400]  We're talking with Bob Chapman. I want to get his breakdown. He joins us every Friday,
[1:33:12.400 --> 1:33:17.400]  the second hour to talk about the economy. I want to get his take on the carbon tax
[1:33:17.400 --> 1:33:22.200]  passing last Friday, passing the House. Kerry's saying it's going to pass the Senate. Kerry
[1:33:22.200 --> 1:33:27.240]  doesn't usually Senator Kerry. John Kerry doesn't usually shoot his mouth off. This
[1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:30.720]  is just horrible news. It's already been announced. People have seen the bill now. They wouldn't
[1:33:30.720 --> 1:33:36.640]  let you read it till after it passed. Home inspections, regulations, taxes, several states,
[1:33:36.640 --> 1:33:42.840]  Ohio and Arizona are moving to pass state legislation blocking it. This will only accelerate the
[1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:48.160]  state's sovereignty movement. That's not succession like the media spends it. That's ninth and
[1:33:48.160 --> 1:33:53.460]  tenth amendment. The state's made the feds. We're the bosses. All powers not expressly
[1:33:53.460 --> 1:33:57.000]  delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states, the people. I want to talk
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:01.200]  about that with him and take your phone calls. Before I do that, I want to tell you about
[1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:07.560]  this hour's sponsor. He's made this hour of the show possible. That's Home Gain. The

[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:03.240]  HomeGain.com. Okay, let's go back now to Bob Chapman. Bob, finish up your point about
[1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:08.600]  government-sponsored terror. You know, I predicted because I saw him pheromongering saying flu's
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:13.200]  about to break out. Then that happened in April. Now they're saying it's going to kill
[1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:18.120]  millions and they've got to have worldwide government and the UN is going to run the
[1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:23.000]  New World Order and they've got to have forced inoculations and European countries are already
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:28.080]  starting it and they have one death in England and they say that the whole country may get
[1:35:28.080 --> 1:35:33.080]  sick from it when it's nothing. I mean, they're using that as fear. They're moving troops
[1:35:33.080 --> 1:35:37.800]  into Pakistan. They're moving Taliban around, which is globalist control to menace everybody.
[1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:44.960]  Got a big story about that up on PrisonPlanet.com for mainstream news sources. Western governments
[1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:50.920]  funding Taliban and al-Qaeda to kill U.S. troops, but not just in Pakistan or Afghanistan.
[1:35:50.920 --> 1:35:55.720]  It's now out in the mainstream news that Taliban is being shipped into attack. U.S. forces
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:36:02.720]  in Iraq is a pretext to keep them there. Manufacturing the whole war. The White House, the last two
[1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:09.680]  Obama and Bush admit they're funding Wahhabist al-Qaeda to attack Iran and the public thinks
[1:36:09.680 --> 1:36:15.000]  Iran is al-Qaeda when it's Shiite, the opposite group. I want to get into that, but you were
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:20.240]  finishing up with government-sponsored terror. Then I want to get into cap-and-trade and then
[1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:21.240]  calls.
[1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:30.440]  Well, in this case, it's not so much terror. It's more about how do we cover up what we've
[1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:37.760]  been doing until we want to pull the plug. Again, harking back to the meeting four weeks
[1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:44.960]  ago in Greece of the Bilderbergers, the number one thing on the agenda was, this thing looks
[1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:50.520]  like it's getting out of control. Maybe we ought to try to button it up. The problem
[1:36:50.520 --> 1:36:56.160]  is they can't button it up. They've gone too far and they can't go back. I think they're
[1:36:56.160 --> 1:37:01.320]  in serious trouble. Yes, they're very aggressive. A good example of that was the aggressive
[1:37:01.320 --> 1:37:07.680]  defense made by the Treasury in behalf of the Fed in the face of 1207. They think that's
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:13.280]  going to work. Even people in Congress are saying, we can't let the Fed do that. It's
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:18.240]  really out of their realm. It's a private corporation. No. They're running into a lot
[1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:23.480]  of roadblocks, but I do think they're going to have another war. I don't want it to start,
[1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:28.600]  but they're going to have it. They're going to have it for one or two reasons. Their plans
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:35.120]  are coming unglued and they have to do something to cover it. Part of their plan is everything
[1:37:35.120 --> 1:37:39.960]  is going to be dreadful. We'll eventually get into a deflationary depression. When that
[1:37:39.960 --> 1:37:44.720]  happens, people are going to be restless. In order to augment that, then they'll have
[1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:51.240]  their war perhaps with Russia or China, or maybe both simultaneously. That'll take everybody
[1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:57.800]  off the streets and supposedly allow them to retain control. The more we talk about
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:02.120]  this on the airwaves, the more people who understand what they're up to, the better
[1:38:02.120 --> 1:38:03.800]  off we're going to be.
[1:38:03.800 --> 1:38:11.280]  Well, Bob, I want to go to a few clips dealing with the carbon tax and get your take on that,
[1:38:11.280 --> 1:38:17.280]  but take North Korea. A terrible regime as the head of ABB, Donald Rumsfeld, the Swiss
[1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:21.880]  company gave them the nuclear reactors in the late nineties to build the weapon. That's
[1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:30.920]  BBC news. They know there's an extra power transfer to his next hard little son. So the
[1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:35.840]  first commie dictator gives it to Kim Jong-il, then he gives it to his his not no son. So
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:42.280]  we're certainly no fans of them, but US forces, South Korean forces, massing, doing flyovers,
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:47.800]  very provocative, trying to get them when they're very unstable to do something to kind
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:54.080]  of create the crisis, kind of like the US ambassador telling Saddam, the US ally, go
[1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:59.000]  ahead and invade Kuwait. We don't get involved in inter-Arab affairs. We always back you
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:04.040]  just like your attack on Iran, Saddam. They're going to test fire a missile. A month ago,
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:09.400]  they put out their their directive. They would fire it today or tomorrow on the anniversary
[1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:13.320]  of the first dictator dying and nothing to do with July 4th. That's when Kim Jong-il's
[1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:19.160]  dad died July 4th. They always test a missile every year on July 3rd or 4th. But the media
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:23.000]  says they want to attack America on July 4th when they already put out the international
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:28.160]  directive under international law, just like when the US or Europe or anybody else test
[1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:34.520]  a missile. They're firing it out in the Pacific a couple thousand miles away from from Hawaii.
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:41.560]  But the media says missiles set to hit Hawaii July 4th. The headlines are that Obama, you
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:47.280]  know, is bold. Here's the ridiculous drudge report. Bold on the 4th of July will Obama
[1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:53.160]  shoot down North Korean missile. So man, you know, they're going to try to blow up Hawaii
[1:39:53.160 --> 1:39:57.560]  with a nuke and murder everyone. And they also say global warming is real and polar bears
[1:39:57.560 --> 1:40:02.320]  can't swim. I mean, just complete lying. They're test firing a missile. They're following
[1:40:02.320 --> 1:40:07.600]  international law. They're telling people the 2000 square square mile area in the middle
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:12.920]  of nowhere they're firing it at and thousands of miles away is Hawaii headline Hawaii to
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:17.760]  be nuked end of America. I mean, are they going to use this as an excuse for something
[1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:23.800]  or will this just be Obama grandstanding saving us all from the evil North Korean missile?
[1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:32.880]  Well, I think what you have to sit back and take in and think to yourself about is North
[1:40:32.880 --> 1:40:40.600]  Korea secretly a quiet state of the United States government? In all probability, yes.
[1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:46.080]  I mean, why would they be doing the things that they're doing? The, you know, we call
[1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:54.440]  them normal for them, but the media is beating the drum and building it up as the great aggressor.
[1:40:54.440 --> 1:40:58.240]  I mean, North Korea is not a threat to the war. They're a joke. I mean, they can't even
[1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:05.480]  get a missile off the ground. That's it. And so I think the US is behind all that. And
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:12.560]  I think they have the North Koreans doing these things. So another thing is it's a diversion.
[1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:19.680]  Let's everybody worry about San Francisco and LA getting hit with rockets. I CBMs.
[1:41:19.680 --> 1:41:24.200]  And at the same time, they'll forget about the horrid situation that's going on in the
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:29.280]  world economy. Well, exactly. In fact, if you look this number up, the last time I saw it,
[1:41:29.280 --> 1:41:33.840]  in fact, Google that for all the viewers out there at prisonplanet.tv and the radio listeners,
[1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:43.240]  Google, let's just show everybody. See my memories accurate. United States number one.
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:49.920]  Don't try this headline. Majority of aid to North Korea comes from US or US number one
[1:41:49.920 --> 1:41:53.760]  giver of aid to North Korea. That'll be the headline. US number one giver of aid because
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:58.960]  I know through the UN, the United States last time I checked was the number one aid, not
[1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:05.640]  even China. And so that point you make has a lot of bearing.
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:11.360]  Well, they've done it before. And, you know, most people don't know it. But if you understand
[1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:18.400]  how intelligence and counterintelligence works, it's a chess game. And they just move people
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:26.520]  around. They buy people. I quoted a new book. I forget the name of it and tomorrow's issue
[1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:35.360]  about the the participation of Martin Borman. And finally, this information is going to
[1:42:35.360 --> 1:42:41.360]  get out that Borman was working for the West. By the way, my dad, I'm on the treadmill two
[1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:46.280]  days ago in the garage at night. My dad comes over to drop my kids off because they've been
[1:42:46.280 --> 1:42:51.200]  over there for the day. Now, granddaddy comes over, he walks into the garage and he says,
[1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:56.400]  look at this book, the secret history of the CIA chapter one admits that Reinhard Galen
[1:42:56.400 --> 1:43:01.920]  was CIA. And so was Martin Borman. And the whole thing was staged. And the West told
[1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:05.520]  Hitler to do all this and then pull the rug out from under him. I already knew that from
[1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:10.120]  German history. That's why Hitler let everybody escape at Dunkirk. He thought he was supposed
[1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:16.000]  to attack the Soviets. He was told to do all this. IBM, Ford, General Motors built all
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:20.280]  his plants. My grandfathers weren't allowed to bomb that when they were flying in the
[1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:26.720]  Army Air Corps. That's, we already knew all that, but now mainstream publishers are admitting
[1:43:26.720 --> 1:43:31.120]  this. Why do you think this is all coming out now, Bob?
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:36.320]  I don't think they can hold it in any longer. I think it's really a case of that. I knew
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:43.560]  all this in about Borman and many other things because I was hooked up with a, a, a many
[1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:50.080]  people who were in German intelligence and counterintelligence during the war. Most of
[1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:56.080]  them were, um, colonels or generals. And they would tell me about all these things. Of course,
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:44:01.840]  this was after the war was over and it was in 1950s. But, uh, I really get filled in
[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:09.880]  on it. And I knew about, I've known about Borman for 55 years, 50 years.
[1:44:09.880 --> 1:44:12.840]  You never talked about that here. Was that because of national security?
[1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:18.880]  They can't hold it in any longer. Yeah. Well, well, you're right, Bob. They can't
[1:44:18.880 --> 1:44:23.760]  hold it in any longer, but it's just so incredible that Hitler was created by the British and
[1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:30.120]  US government on record. There's a book called Hitler at Versailles
[1:44:30.120 --> 1:44:39.120]  by Leon DeGrel and Hitler was born at Versailles. And the whole thing was set up, the reparation
[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:45.600]  movement, uh, the, uh, depression in Germany during the 1920s, uh, the evolution of Mussolini
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:51.800]  from being a communist into a fascist and then the, uh, the ascension of Adolf Hitler
[1:44:51.800 --> 1:44:59.520]  with money from Paris, London, uh, New York, the bushes and their family, et cetera. The
[1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:04.960]  whole thing was a set up and all those people get killed for nothing.
[1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:09.720]  Well, that also came out in the McCormick-Dickstein committee with, uh, Major General Spendley
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:15.200]  Butler of the Marine Corps. He was the only two-time congressional medal of honor winner
[1:45:15.200 --> 1:45:19.920]  at that time. I think he still is most highly decorated in US military history. I mean a
[1:45:19.920 --> 1:45:26.640]  real Rambo. And of all these conflicts, he'd overthrown more than 14 countries for the
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:31.360]  United States and the banks. So they came to him in 35 and said, we funded Hitler. We're
[1:45:31.360 --> 1:45:34.960]  going to have a fascist takeover here in the US as well. That's when it could have gone
[1:45:34.960 --> 1:45:39.680]  both ways. He played along and then blew the whistle. And that was in the New York times
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:44.800]  everywhere else. It's in my Phil Marshall law. We also get a little bit into it in end game.
[1:45:44.800 --> 1:45:51.080]  But the issue is that later in the thirties, that came out in the Cormick-Dickstein committee,
[1:45:51.080 --> 1:45:57.480]  but the average American doesn't even know, though I have the film reels shot at the time
[1:45:57.480 --> 1:46:08.160]  in there in the congressional hearings. The more you dig, the worse it gets. Well, thank
[1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:12.640]  God he played along with them for six months and he was to lead a 500,000 man team. They
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:18.540]  were already federalizing the cities covertly and Bush's granddaddy was one of the head
[1:46:18.540 --> 1:46:23.200]  honchos. It's just unbelievable. But see, he wasn't a German agent. People always say
[1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:29.040]  he's it. No, no, the German agents were their agents. People get this chain of command wrong.
[1:46:29.040 --> 1:46:34.880]  Well, I mean, the king of England had to advocate not over the lady he married. He was in Germany
[1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:42.160]  when the war started. He's 100% German. Edward the eighth. In fact, guys Google Edward the
[1:46:42.160 --> 1:46:46.400]  eighth with Hitler and you'll see him. Highling Hitler. Pull it up. It'll be with a bunch
[1:46:46.400 --> 1:46:51.180]  of photos, but the most famous one is Hitler in his car and the king of England is Highling
[1:46:51.180 --> 1:46:56.840]  Hitler to him. He can't make this kitty Kelly's books about it. Okay, Bob, I want to hold
[1:46:56.840 --> 1:46:59.680]  you a little bit in the next hour. I should have asked you off air. You may have another
[1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:04.000]  interview coming up, but I want to start getting to this. I'm free. Okay, good. I want to say
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:11.200]  one more thing and that is the book Hitler born at Versailles by Leon de Groot. I knew
[1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:16.840]  Leon de Groot very, very well. He was a good friend of mine and he was the head of the
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:23.440]  Wallonian division in the SS during the war. And he was one of the people who really filled
[1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:31.280]  me in and what went on and I financed that book. Amazing. So you've been not violating
[1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:35.680]  your national security letter, but leaking a bed out so people could learn about that.
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:40.080]  Well, listen, one of my grandfathers was a leasehound just mid level working for the
[1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:46.120]  oil companies out trying to get folks at least their land to them in West Texas and New Mexico.
[1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:50.680]  And he said after World War two, there were more Germans in many of those towns than there
[1:47:50.680 --> 1:47:56.480]  were Americans and they'd be in the bars and the steak houses. And he said he'd see Germans.
[1:47:56.480 --> 1:48:01.920]  He'd seen in newsreels just walking around with CIA people all over the place at these
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:05.600]  military bases because that'd be the only place to go eat when you're out driving around
[1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:10.720]  the middle of nowhere in New Mexico or West Texas. And he was telling me about this stuff
[1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:16.960]  and he wasn't in intelligence. You know, he just been in the in the Air Corps. So just
[1:48:16.960 --> 1:48:21.960]  Germans everywhere and Germans all and then my uncle lived in Guatemala. He told me about
[1:48:21.960 --> 1:48:27.200]  all the old Germans down there. And I mean, they're just Germans all over the place. They
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:33.960]  were taken out on the rat line. Yeah, operation paper. Okay, we got a shift years now. There
[1:48:33.960 --> 1:48:41.800]  is Edward VIII with Adolf Alois Hitler. And that is right at the start of the war. There
[1:48:41.800 --> 1:48:49.560]  you go, ladies and gentlemen, the king of England, Heil Hitler. Okay, let's go ahead
[1:48:49.560 --> 1:48:57.480]  now and get into the global carbon tax on record time magazine. Financial Times of London
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:01.560]  say it's a world government tax. The private bank shall even pay some of your taxes to
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:05.560]  Al Gore. He said what's wrong with that in front of Congress two weeks ago. Here is
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:10.200]  Pat Buchanan though saying it and people are now attacking him. This is Pat Buchanan
[1:49:10.200 --> 1:49:15.560]  as we analyze it from MSNBC. Here it is. I'm joined now live from Washington by MSNBC
[1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:19.480]  political analyst, Pat Buchanan. So with another good morning, Pat, we've got the president
[1:49:19.480 --> 1:49:23.320]  calling this new climate bill a jobs bill because he says it's going to create clean
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:27.840]  energy jobs. You have House minority leader, John Boehner saying it's a tax bill. Why doesn't
[1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:34.320]  anyone want to call it a climate bill? Well, because the science is suggesting that maybe
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:39.200]  all of this isn't really happening or it's not really dangerous or it's not really man
[1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:43.040]  made. Barack Obama, the president was right when he said we shouldn't be afraid of the
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:48.320]  future. That is how this bill got passed through fear. We're all going to change. The climate
[1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:52.200]  is going to change. The oceans are going to rise. Our cities are going to be underwater.
[1:49:52.200 --> 1:49:57.800]  But more and more science is coming forward to say this is a hoax and a scam, which is
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:50:02.840]  designed to transfer wealth and power from the private sector to the government sector
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:06.440]  and from the government of the United States to a world government, which is what we're
[1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:12.360]  going to get in Copenhagen when we get the Kyoto to agreement. Okay, here come the emails.
[1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:17.640]  Anyway, I'm pat, you know, when the bill passed, it's broken to a sort of. We've got links
[1:50:17.640 --> 1:50:25.720]  to it up on info wars.com and present planet.com. Again, mainstream news articles. I've got dozens
[1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:30.360]  of them. I filmed the Obama deception blowups of the articles. They're saying world government.
[1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:35.640]  But then if we say we don't want world government, Bob, they say we're cooks and it doesn't exist.
[1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:41.720]  Well, we just keep on telling the people and they'll catch on. Absolutely. Folks, get the

[1:50:58.840 --> 1:51:09.920]  The new world order beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals
[1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:17.720]  and now experimenting with viruses. Without a long term food solution, you will have just
[1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:27.280]  two options. Starves surrender or surrender. All canned food supplies will eventually run

[1:52:01.400 --> 1:52:07.520]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[1:52:07.520 --> 1:52:12.240]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:13.320]  like to see.
[1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:18.480]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:52:18.480 --> 1:52:19.680]  of the American people.
[1:52:19.680 --> 1:52:24.240]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:52:24.240 --> 1:52:29.360]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:52:29.360 --> 1:52:37.480]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:52:37.480 --> 1:52:42.200]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one world government. This film documents
[1:52:42.200 --> 1:52:49.160]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama

[1:52:56.120 --> 1:53:00.640]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.

[1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:10.200]  many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart

[1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:35.960]  Your calls are coming up as we start the next hour in T-minus 5 minutes 30 seconds. But
[1:54:35.960 --> 1:54:41.280]  Bob, cap and trade, I mean they openly say that large portions of it will be paid to
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:48.160]  offshore banks who will set the global carbon tax. Other parts will be paid to Al Gore's
[1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:55.000]  private trading company. Enron came up with the idea 12 years ago, that's even a congressional
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:01.280]  testimony for this new level of pyramided derivatives. Is this an attempt to create
[1:55:01.280 --> 1:55:06.960]  a new derivatives bubble to set up these new carbon taxes and how much can we pay? I mean
[1:55:06.960 --> 1:55:14.920]  everything's already going bankrupt. The Democrats say it's only $2,800 to $2,500 per person.
[1:55:14.920 --> 1:55:19.000]  Now they're admitting home inspections will happen in the bill. I mean this is worse than
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:22.640]  the Soviet Union. How are we going to pay money we don't have? And how are we going
[1:55:22.640 --> 1:55:27.560]  to pay money openly to that bastard criminal who claims he invented the Internet, Al Gore?
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:32.920]  Well, first of all, the Russians have a good take on that. We ran an article out of Pravda.
[1:55:32.920 --> 1:55:39.600]  Oh, I guess it was a week ago, maybe two weeks ago, which described exactly what you just
[1:55:39.600 --> 1:55:45.200]  said. What is this, the Soviet Union? I mean, don't these people in America get it? But
[1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:51.880]  anyway, look, the bottom line on the carbon tax is it's for international financing, the
[1:55:51.880 --> 1:56:01.080]  IMF, the UN, the World Bank, and then there's slush funds to enrich the aluminous who are
[1:56:01.080 --> 1:56:07.600]  involved in this. What is the bottom line? The bottom line is the American people and
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:13.400]  eventually the people of the world are all going to end up paying a 20% tax for this
[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:23.800]  cap-and-trade kind of legislation. Now, the Obama administration would like to get a health
[1:56:23.800 --> 1:56:31.520]  plan passed. And where that happened, I apologize, I just had some studio guys walking in and
[1:56:31.520 --> 1:56:39.760]  I had my mic on. Go ahead, Bob, sorry. The health plan, most of it's going to be financed
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:47.440]  and the American public doesn't know it yet by a VAT, a value-added tax, a tax that goes
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:56.520]  on things and production and services at every stage, another 20%. So if you're in a 25%
[1:56:56.520 --> 1:57:02.520]  tax bracket and you pay the state 5%, which is 30%, you play your Social Security, that
[1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:08.960]  takes you up to 35%. And then you get another 40% for these two items. You're in for 75%,
[1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:15.480]  not counting your real estate taxes, state sales taxes, and so on. And so you could be
[1:57:15.480 --> 1:57:24.920]  an in as a low-level taxpayer. You could be in for 75% or 80% taxation. And this is what
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:28.600]  they're after. They want to enslave you.
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:37.000]  Well, it's neo-servitim, it's neo-futilism. What is it, 234 years? 235 years since 1776.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:41.240]  I mean, this is the land of the free, home of the brave. Now we have this total nanny
[1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:45.240]  state where they're saying, you've got to have government insurance or we're going to
[1:57:45.240 --> 1:57:50.000]  find you. We're going to inspect your house. We're going to shut down your factories. But
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:53.920]  China and Mexico don't have to follow this. I mean, they clearly, as the globalists have
[1:57:53.920 --> 1:57:59.120]  said, want to kill all our industry and make us all be on welfare so they can carry out
[1:57:59.120 --> 1:58:03.000]  their control freak eugenics on us.
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:07.440]  That's correct. That's exactly what they want to do. And they want to bring America
[1:58:07.440 --> 1:58:12.040]  and Europe to their knees and the rest of the world will follow them down. And there's
[1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:16.440]  more freedom in Europe and America probably than any place else, perhaps with the exception
[1:58:16.440 --> 1:58:21.320]  of Canada. And Canada exports 80% of what they make to the United States, so they're
[1:58:21.320 --> 1:58:26.400]  going to suffer as well. So that's what they're out. And then this is why they have deliberately
[1:58:26.400 --> 1:58:29.240]  caused this. These people are not dumb.
[1:58:29.240 --> 1:58:33.720]  No, they're monopoly men and they don't even want to middle class that can challenge them.
[1:58:33.720 --> 1:58:39.600]  This is full spectrum dominance. All right, the third hour is coming up in just a few
[1:58:39.600 --> 1:58:42.920]  seconds.

[2:00:23.480 --> 2:00:31.740]  of our nation's founding against tyranny, we have confirmed that Northcom and its main
[2:00:31.740 --> 2:00:42.160]  mission is to engage U.S. militias. Remember that case in the Midwest in Arcadia a few months
[2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:48.680]  ago where the National Guard was training to go house to house for gun confiscation
[2:00:48.680 --> 2:00:54.720]  drills. The Houston Chronicle yesterday reported the police are doing door to door asking
[2:00:54.720 --> 2:01:01.240]  about guns, knock and talk. The New York Times reported that Homeland Security is funding
[2:01:01.240 --> 2:01:08.800]  the Boy Scouts to train, to quote, take on U.S. veterans and gun owners and kill them.
[2:01:08.800 --> 2:01:18.560]  Hitler, Eugen, this is the news tribune. Mainstream news. Guard units trained for militia attacks.
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:25.320]  The military and Northcom admits in their Homeland Security report their main enemy
[2:01:25.320 --> 2:01:30.960]  is American patriots who were against the offshore banks taken over. If you're offshore
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:35.280]  criminal banks, they're going to give the people no quarter and bankrupt the entire
[2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:44.480]  society. What do you do? What do you do? You set up and brainwash the police and military
[2:01:44.480 --> 2:01:48.320]  against the people. We're going to go ahead and go to your calls, but I'm going to cover
[2:01:48.320 --> 2:01:53.560]  this in depth. Kurt Nemo is doing a story on it right now at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[2:01:53.560 --> 2:01:56.520]  In fact, call Watson. Tell him to go ahead and just get this up on Prison Planet. I
[2:01:56.520 --> 2:02:01.520]  know Kurt's writing an article. We just need to get the article up now. This is just massive.
[2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:08.560]  Where does it end, Bob Chapman? It ends, unfortunately, in the streets. As I've said on this program
[2:02:08.560 --> 2:02:17.520]  before, I think 90% of the military will refuse to act against the American fellow citizen.
[2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:23.720]  I think that law enforcement will do the same thing. Maybe that's wishful thinking, but
[2:02:23.720 --> 2:02:28.360]  I think that's a way it will turn out. I think that these people are going to be exposed
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:33.800]  for what they are and courts will be set up and they'll be tried and they'll be sent
[2:02:33.800 --> 2:02:42.000]  away to jail and their fortunes will be confiscated from their attire family and some of them
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:43.440]  should be tried for treason.
[2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:49.360]  Well, we're going to put on prisonplanet.tv screen right now. The 14-year-olds with the
[2:02:49.360 --> 2:02:54.760]  machine guns training to take on vets, New York Times, and the first line of the article
[2:02:54.760 --> 2:02:59.480]  says they're training to take on disgruntled vets. Now, what does the Homeland Security
[2:02:59.480 --> 2:03:04.600]  report say? Disgruntled vets, gun owners. It's been for two years. Mainstream news are
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:11.440]  training every police department to prepare for Iraq vets with IEDs to bomb you. What
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:16.640]  is it the feds are planning that's so bad that they know veterans are going to be bombing
[2:03:16.640 --> 2:03:17.640]  police?
[2:03:17.640 --> 2:03:22.720]  When I had the emergency management head on from Indiana, how the feds are preparing
[2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:27.320]  for mass graves into hard and old police centers? It's because you're the criminals.
[2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:32.120]  You work for the criminal bankers. I mean, Bob Chapman, this is getting incredible.
[2:03:32.120 --> 2:03:38.320]  It is. And you know, I put out some information just recently, about a month ago, and I said
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:45.600]  that in general, that by the end of October, we should have events happening that could
[2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:52.440]  cause a bank holiday. And as far as I know, nobody else came out with that information.
[2:03:52.440 --> 2:04:01.200]  And I think it probably will be the dollar, which is going to get out and perhaps break
[2:04:01.200 --> 2:04:09.400]  through its support level on the USDX is 7118. And I think that could trigger the possible
[2:04:09.400 --> 2:04:16.760]  devaluation of perhaps just the dollar and the pound, but maybe many other currencies.
[2:04:16.760 --> 2:04:23.120]  They may have another meeting, a conference like the Smithsonian in the early 70s and
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:31.880]  the plaza records of 85. And what they might do is devalue all currencies against one another
[2:04:31.880 --> 2:04:39.000]  and default on a certain amount of debt, or perhaps all of it. And of course, their solution
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:44.440]  is going to be a new world currency. And that's what they would like.
[2:04:44.440 --> 2:04:48.880]  And they're openly saying that, Bob, we got a break when I come back, blitz through calls
[2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:53.040]  and I'm going to break down the latest. They're in the open, saying they're going to use the
[2:04:53.040 --> 2:05:01.240]  US military against the American people. This is high treason.
[2:05:01.240 --> 2:05:05.040]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly

[2:06:05.640 --> 2:06:10.520]  what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[2:06:10.520 --> 2:06:15.480]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water. Many
[2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:19.600]  of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental
[2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:24.480]  system diseases. Now what are you going to do about it? The Acola blue atmospheric water

[2:08:02.240 --> 2:08:09.920]  radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:08:09.920 --> 2:08:17.680]  We are taught by the architects propaganda, the map makers of the mind, the spin doctors.
[2:08:17.680 --> 2:08:23.960]  Then our liberty means an American flag and the Statue of Liberty. That America's about
[2:08:23.960 --> 2:08:29.080]  being able to have a Mohawk if you want for a crew cut. No, ladies and gentlemen, it is
[2:08:29.080 --> 2:08:34.120]  about the Bill of Rights and Constitution. It's about not having a carbon tax and bureaucrats
[2:08:34.120 --> 2:08:39.800]  doing home inspections and shutting down all our factories and ranches. It's about not
[2:08:39.800 --> 2:08:46.240]  having an animal and premises ID written up by the big agribusinesses a few years ago
[2:08:46.240 --> 2:08:52.840]  being forced on farmers and ranchers where they got to have a $20 tag on a $5 chicken.
[2:08:52.840 --> 2:08:58.160]  But Tyson chicken is exempt. They don't have to have the tag on their chickens. They have
[2:08:58.160 --> 2:09:04.200]  one tag per giant building with tens of thousands of chickens. It's meant to bankrupt the small
[2:09:04.200 --> 2:09:09.840]  farms and ranches, harass you, come on your property. They're SWAT teaming Amish selling
[2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:15.280]  milk to themselves and butter. They're SWAT teaming in the news people selling farm raised
[2:09:15.280 --> 2:09:19.960]  eggs on the side of the highway, watermelons, the SWAT teaming people that sell their neighbors
[2:09:19.960 --> 2:09:26.240]  milk. I mean, this is in the news every week. SWAT teams come in and bust in. They're making
[2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:32.040]  living on the land, not being dependent in some compact control grid city. They're making
[2:09:32.040 --> 2:09:37.280]  that terrorism and they're training the police and military that gun owners, veterans and
[2:09:37.280 --> 2:09:41.280]  conservatives are terrorists. We're the folks that brought broke the Mayak report. We're
[2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:45.400]  the folks that broke the DHS report. And now it's in mainstream news. They're training
[2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:53.020]  the US military to take on conservative gun owners. The whole North com anti terror, anti
[2:09:53.020 --> 2:09:58.960]  al-Qaeda system that conservatives thought was for al-Qaeda is for you. And the army
[2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:04.280]  times admits that number one threat gun owning Americans. There have been big new developments
[2:10:04.280 --> 2:10:08.160]  on that front. That's coming up for Bob Chapman leaves us right now. Let's go to calls with
[2:10:08.160 --> 2:10:14.360]  Bob Chapman, the international forecaster.com John in Ohio. You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[2:10:14.360 --> 2:10:19.600]  Go ahead. Yeah. Hello, Bob. Hello, Alex. Alex first time caller and I've studied your
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:24.400]  stuff for a while. And I got to say, um, I had started paying attention to stuff like
[2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:29.160]  this, um, listening to Mark corn key of the Michigan militia and other guys back in the
[2:10:29.160 --> 2:10:33.560]  late nineties. And, uh, it's a real eye opener. And you've done, you've done a great job.
[2:10:33.560 --> 2:10:39.160]  I think opening our eyes on a lot of these things. But what I wanted to ask you about
[2:10:39.160 --> 2:10:45.160]  and ask Bob about is the idea of mind control. Now, I know one thing that the communists
[2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:49.600]  said years ago, of course, we know the communists are funded by the globalists. If you control
[2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:54.400]  the language that a people speak, you can control their minds. And they've been dumb
[2:10:54.400 --> 2:10:58.080]  in the language down. They've been reducing a lot of the public really can't even hardly
[2:10:58.080 --> 2:11:02.920]  talk. They just kind of grunt now. And, uh, that's why they feds always increase the
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:07.920]  public education funding because public education is a great success. It's meant to dumb them
[2:11:07.920 --> 2:11:12.280]  down. The war on drugs is a great success. Triple the heroin, double the cocaine from
[2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:16.080]  a couple hundred thousand in prison to over four million in prison. The whole society
[2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:20.800]  collapsing trillions laundered to the banks in the last decade. It's a great success.
[2:11:20.800 --> 2:11:24.440]  The war on terror is meant to take all our liberties and freedoms. Great success. The
[2:11:24.440 --> 2:11:28.000]  war on illiteracy. Great success. Dumb people down. Go ahead.
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:33.120]  I wanted to ask Bob a little bit about the, you know, the Kennedy conspiracy. I was watching
[2:11:33.120 --> 2:11:38.440]  this morning. Um, they had that, of course, that hatchet piece that Mr. Jennings did before
[2:11:38.440 --> 2:11:44.280]  he passed away, the JFKB on the conspiracy on ABC, where they claimed they could simulate
[2:11:44.280 --> 2:11:49.600]  exactly with, um, with the films, how all of this happened. And I noticed during the
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:54.560]  whole thing, and then there was another documentary on Abraham Lincoln, they used very specific
[2:11:54.560 --> 2:11:59.760]  words, you know, to kind of like, well, um, Robert Dalek, the famous historian says, well,
[2:11:59.760 --> 2:12:05.320]  people just can't accept that life is very random and things happen and the conspiracies
[2:12:05.320 --> 2:12:10.320]  make them feel emotionally better. And, you know, I noticed that they do that. They speak
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:16.160]  in tones, you know, and they try to, and it is a way to kind of lull you to sleep.
[2:12:16.160 --> 2:12:24.520]  Bob. Propaganda is, uh, one of the, uh, the greatest tools of government, uh, that was
[2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:29.800]  proven during the 1930s, not only in Germany, but in the United States and to some extent
[2:12:29.800 --> 2:12:36.560]  in Japan. And of course it's evolved from American advertising through the years. And
[2:12:36.560 --> 2:12:42.000]  now you have people who are on the air, who give you 95% of the proof and truth. And then
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:49.920]  the other 5% is either misdirection, misinformation, or it's pure propaganda and mind control.
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:55.160]  And there's a number of people doing this and that they are doing it, but, you know,
[2:12:55.160 --> 2:12:57.520]  you know them by what they do.
[2:12:57.520 --> 2:13:03.720]  John, I appreciate your call. Look, I had the Wall Street Journal here doing a big profile
[2:13:03.720 --> 2:13:10.200]  on me. It's a 1300 word front section profile. Pretty scary, actually, because of that kind
[2:13:10.200 --> 2:13:17.800]  of attention. And it's always the same question. And she admitted that's what the university
[2:13:17.800 --> 2:13:22.440]  professors, she goes to interview, always say, they need to simplify the world and imagine
[2:13:22.440 --> 2:13:27.640]  someone's in control. It's too scary to know that 19 guys from a cave did this. So they
[2:13:27.640 --> 2:13:32.560]  make it up. No, it's much scarier to know there's a global empire. We have thousands
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:38.160]  of their own documents. They're openly announcing their world empire. And I had psychology today
[2:13:38.160 --> 2:13:42.040]  calling me up for a big cover story. And I would say, is there a world government? Are
[2:13:42.040 --> 2:13:46.560]  they announcing it on the news? And the guy would just say, what happened in your childhood
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:51.680]  that makes you believe this? And I said it's in Newsweek called New World Order saying it's
[2:13:51.680 --> 2:13:57.880]  a global bank to rule the United States and knock our heads when we're bad. That's a quote.
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:02.520]  And they're open. I mean, I made a film two years ago called Endgame talking about the
[2:14:02.520 --> 2:14:07.280]  carbon tax and how it was a tax. And people say I'm a conspiracy theorist as they announce
[2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:13.120]  its attacks. I mean, it's just it's a mind game they play. And a lot of people don't
[2:14:13.120 --> 2:14:17.440]  respect themselves. So it works on them. You didn't read an article, Alex, that said New
[2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:23.160]  World Order was a global government. Nobody's saying New World Order, Alex. Now, don't be
[2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:28.760]  a cuck like pet Buchanan. I saw Scarborough making fun of Buchanan the other day on TV.
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:33.600]  I saw a clip. Oh, yeah, Buchanan says it's a world government. Oh, you know, that clip
[2:14:33.600 --> 2:14:39.520]  we played last hour. If they're openly announcing world government, and then laughing at us
[2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:44.200]  when we go, look, we don't want your world tax. They go, there's no such thing as a carbon
[2:14:44.200 --> 2:14:49.840]  tax. We just passed it in the house. It's a mind game. And I guess it works. It's like
[2:14:49.840 --> 2:14:54.320]  a Jedi mind trick on these idiots. But I'm like job of the hut, folks. It doesn't work
[2:14:54.320 --> 2:15:03.400]  on me. Oh, teeny Jedi. I mean, what it's these flim flam scammers as they openly set up Bank
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:07.680]  of the World to rule us and turn loose all their bureaucrats on us. They say it doesn't
[2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:11.960]  exist. Bob, how do you get the chicken neck cowardly public out there? I don't mean the
[2:15:11.960 --> 2:15:16.960]  whole public, but those that can't understand this is real. What do we do about them? Just
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:23.840]  move on triage. We have to continue to put out the information that we are until their
[2:15:23.840 --> 2:15:28.240]  bellies are empty. And that's what's going to make them move. They lose their home. They
[2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:32.600]  lose their cars. They lose their job and they're living under a bridge with a trolley
[2:15:32.600 --> 2:15:36.880]  from the supermarket. And all their worldly goods are in there and they're wondering where
[2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:41.400]  the next meal is going to come from. And that's when half of the population in America will
[2:15:41.400 --> 2:15:47.080]  act. And the police are going to mow them down and the police are probably going to mow
[2:15:47.080 --> 2:15:50.600]  down their own grandmother in the crowd. It won't matter. They'll be wearing the black
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:55.320]  uniform and they'll have American flags on their cars as they burn the Bellarites. I
[2:15:55.320 --> 2:16:00.320]  love America. Come on, police and military, wake up. Let's take another call because you're
[2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:03.200]  going to be used to carry out this tyranny. We're not saying you're the enemy, but the
[2:16:03.200 --> 2:16:08.800]  enemy is using you. You're taking orders from the offshore banks. Period. It's a fact. Congress
[2:16:08.800 --> 2:16:17.680]  admits it. In fact, Google for folks. Top Democrat says bankers run Congress and you'll
[2:16:17.680 --> 2:16:22.480]  find 20 articles or so because all these top leaders, Republican and Democrat, the leader
[2:16:22.480 --> 2:16:27.160]  of the Senate, the leader of the House have said, yeah, foreign banks run us. It's our
[2:16:27.160 --> 2:16:31.160]  new masters. Yeah, we're taking over with continuity government. We're preparing to
[2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:34.760]  fight with the American people. We know they're not going to want it, but we're owned now
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:41.760]  by foreign banks through fraud. It's illegitimate. Jack in South Carolina here on the air with
[2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:48.000]  Bob Chapman. Go ahead. Yes, sir. Alex, just want to wish y'all a happy pre-4th of July
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:54.480]  and got really two questions. First one's for Bob. How do we change this country in
[2:16:54.480 --> 2:17:00.880]  a peaceful way when we cannot trust the voting machines? What's to keep the NWO from rigging
[2:17:00.880 --> 2:17:06.520]  the voting machines? They've been caught rigging them everywhere. Go ahead. Yes, sir. How do
[2:17:06.520 --> 2:17:13.440]  we do that, Bob? Yeah, well, obviously, that is impossible if they're going to continue
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:19.800]  to be allowed to rig them. So maybe that avenue is no longer open to us. We're going to find
[2:17:19.800 --> 2:17:26.840]  something out about that when finally we get this 1207 Ron Paul, let's investigate the
[2:17:26.840 --> 2:17:33.960]  Fed bill out of committee, if we can get it out of committee. Bonnie Frank, that famous
[2:17:33.960 --> 2:17:38.840]  American citizen. And incidentally, I get some real good stuff on him and some others
[2:17:38.840 --> 2:17:44.360]  in this issue coming out tomorrow, but I want you to go and get a free copy so you can
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:49.800]  read it for yourself. But Bonnie Frank and Nancy Pelosi are holding that captive right
[2:17:49.800 --> 2:17:57.480]  now. And as Alex said, they have some 255 sponsors. There's a lot of heat being generated
[2:17:57.480 --> 2:18:04.120]  by constituents and people in Congress. And maybe that's the way we have to approach this
[2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:09.120]  is if we can't control who's going to go in there, let's terrify them. Exactly. Once
[2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:15.360]  they get there. And exactly. Why do we have offshore offshore banks saying we can't audit
[2:18:15.360 --> 2:18:24.800]  them? Go ahead. Second thing is this offshore thing, you know, American citizens, if they
[2:18:24.800 --> 2:18:29.720]  have an offshore account have to declare it. And of course, you go on a great list if you
[2:18:29.720 --> 2:18:36.560]  do have one and declare it. But all of the wealthy, the CFR, the Bilderberg is they all
[2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:41.720]  have offshore accounts, and they all hide their money. But nothing ever happens to them.
[2:18:41.720 --> 2:18:47.120]  Yeah, all they're doing with this is rating the middle classes accounts for themselves.
[2:18:47.120 --> 2:18:53.600]  Anything else caller? Yes, sir. I worry about you, Alex, because I worry about them. The
[2:18:53.600 --> 2:18:59.440]  black ops running some brainwashed huge into a public place and opening up on innocent
[2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:03.760]  people. They're going to do it. Everybody know they're going to do it and show people
[2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:07.160]  how they've been caught in the past doing it. And that's why they're gearing up the
[2:19:07.160 --> 2:19:10.720]  military to use them against us. And I've always said for over a decade, then they'll
[2:19:10.720 --> 2:19:16.400]  start staging mass shootings and saying it's gun owners and militia people. And if you
[2:19:16.400 --> 2:19:20.100]  don't give your farmer ranch up when the bureaucrats come to take it, they're going to blow your
[2:19:20.100 --> 2:19:25.360]  house up and say you were Al Qaeda militia. I mean, all the mainstream TV says white Al
[2:19:25.360 --> 2:19:30.040]  Qaeda is everywhere and people that talk about the Bill of Rights really work for Al Qaeda.
[2:19:30.040 --> 2:19:34.200]  And there's a bunch of idiots that will believe that they'll the average American will take
[2:19:34.200 --> 2:19:38.440]  the Bill of Rights out and burn it if they tell them Al Qaeda wrote it. I'm surprised
[2:19:38.440 --> 2:19:45.400]  they don't teach kids in school that Al Qaeda wrote the Bill of Rights. We'll be right back
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:49.880]  after this quick break. Few final calls for Bob Chapman. Then I'm going to break down the
[2:19:49.880 --> 2:19:54.440]  U.S. military publicly preparing to wage war against the American people because on this
[2:19:54.440 --> 2:20:00.000]  fourth of July, it's not our military anymore. It's been taken over by offshore banks publicly.
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:06.760]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question. What would
[2:20:06.760 --> 2:20:11.320]  you list as the things that the federal government does really well? The armed forces in printing
[2:20:11.320 --> 2:20:15.640]  bogus money doesn't count. I'll take that blank page of yours and list the ways that
[2:20:15.640 --> 2:20:20.640]  you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets. The only real option is
[2:20:20.640 --> 2:20:25.840]  precious metals for your retirement, your kids' education or just plain survival when the
[2:20:25.840 --> 2:20:30.880]  whole Obama mess comes crashing down. You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus
[2:20:30.880 --> 2:20:35.400]  package and I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your
[2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:45.320]  family. Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128, that's 800-686-2237, extension
[2:20:45.320 --> 2:20:50.720]  128 and together we can develop a make sense program before the clock runs out. Once more,
[2:20:50.720 --> 2:21:01.840]  John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128 and take charge of your future and thank you.
[2:21:01.840 --> 2:21:07.960]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[2:21:07.960 --> 2:21:12.640]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[2:21:12.640 --> 2:21:18.120]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[2:21:18.120 --> 2:21:22.680]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged
[2:21:22.680 --> 2:21:27.400]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[2:21:27.400 --> 2:21:33.400]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[2:21:33.400 --> 2:21:39.760]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right, it's about
[2:21:39.760 --> 2:21:46.280]  a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told
[2:21:46.280 --> 2:21:53.360]  and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download

[2:24:09.520 --> 2:24:13.640]  Great news blitz coming up in the next segment. I'm going to break down the U.S. military
[2:24:13.640 --> 2:24:20.520]  training to take on the American people. That is treason, violation of the Posit Conventatus.
[2:24:20.520 --> 2:24:26.680]  The troops take the people on in Mexico. They do in the Soviet Union. They do in Communist
[2:24:26.680 --> 2:24:35.560]  China. That's not freedom. That's not the spirit of 1776. On this day before July 4th,
[2:24:35.560 --> 2:24:40.880]  blood units trained for militia attacks. So we'll break all that down coming up. Let's
[2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:45.080]  go back to the calls. Let's talk to Michael in Australia. Thanks for holding, Michael.
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:24:49.520]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman. Hello, Alex. Hello, Bob. How are you?
[2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:59.280]  Fine. Thank you. Look, just picking up what you left off there about the military. Look,
[2:24:59.280 --> 2:25:07.480]  if they're going to be disloyal to the American people, once they're finished doing what they
[2:25:07.480 --> 2:25:12.360]  have to do, they're not going to be wanted anymore because they can't be trusted.
[2:25:12.360 --> 2:25:16.720]  In fact, that happens 100% of the time. And I forgot we had a caller from Australia. I
[2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:19.360]  would have gone to you early. Hold on, Michael. Let's get Bob's take on that and you can
[2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:24.720]  have a comment back. I appreciate you calling. Yeah, in the Soviet Union in Russia, Pol Pot,
[2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:31.640]  Fidel Castro with Caesar, any time these guys grab power, what's the next thing they do,
[2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:39.400]  Bob? They usually get all of the people who they think are a threat, round them up, either
[2:25:39.400 --> 2:25:44.160]  put them in camps or they liquidate them. And that's what these Homeland Security reports
[2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:49.600]  say. They say the veterans are the number one threat. So they use the vets against the
[2:25:49.600 --> 2:25:52.900]  people. They use the troops against the people. And then when they're done, the SWAT team
[2:25:52.900 --> 2:25:58.320]  kills them. Go ahead, Bob.
[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:02.280]  Well, that's what they think they'd like to do. And I don't think it's going to quite
[2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:08.800]  work out that way because people who are in law enforcement and in the American military,
[2:26:08.800 --> 2:26:14.600]  all over the world are listening to these broadcasts. And my publication is going to
[2:26:14.600 --> 2:26:20.360]  embassies, the State Department, it's the most copy publication in the world. It's all
[2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:27.040]  over Washington, every issue. And also, I have subscribers who are in the military in
[2:26:27.040 --> 2:26:34.400]  both Afghanistan and in Iraq. And I've told them, you know, make sure everybody in the
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:37.000]  theater sees the publication.
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  And doesn't Bob...
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:39.920]  My publication is going all over the place.
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:44.200]  And that's the International Forecaster. People get a free copy of the InternationalForecaster.com.
[2:26:44.200 --> 2:26:48.960]  Doesn't the system know, just like my films are all over the world, don't they know that
[2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:53.120]  by carrying out the tyranny, they're just validating everything you and I and countless
[2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:56.040]  others have been documenting was going to happen?
[2:26:56.040 --> 2:27:02.040]  Yes. And they don't care because they think we're just a couple of rogues and they can
[2:27:02.040 --> 2:27:09.040]  easily dismiss this or liquidate it or whatever. And, you know, if there wasn't any opposition,
[2:27:09.040 --> 2:27:13.000]  they'd create it. And so here's you and I and a handful of other people who are telling
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:17.800]  people the truth. And they say, so what? They're not going to penetrate enough to make a difference.
[2:27:17.800 --> 2:27:18.800]  Well, they're wrong.
[2:27:18.800 --> 2:27:20.600]  We are going to make a difference.
[2:27:20.600 --> 2:27:23.560]  They think the American people are stupid and broke back. And I'm telling you, they're
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:27.520]  not. They're going to wake up. Okay, Australia, go ahead and finish up what you were saying,
[2:27:27.520 --> 2:27:28.520]  Michael.
[2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:32.960]  Yeah, actually, I wanted to bring up the swine flu. You mentioned earlier that the UK was
[2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:39.040]  hyping this up. One death and suddenly it's a national crisis. We're right in the middle
[2:27:39.040 --> 2:27:45.960]  of our winter, as you're probably aware. And we've had 10 deaths from the swine flu.
[2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:50.120]  They've got whole cities locked down, whole cities locked down. They're talking about
[2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:54.760]  force inoculations. Tell us what's happening there in the land down under nothing's happening
[2:27:54.760 --> 2:28:00.280]  here. I mean, the government basically said this is not a big deal. There's no, there's
[2:28:00.280 --> 2:28:04.560]  no vaccination. So there's no way there can be forced vaccination at the moment. But as
[2:28:04.560 --> 2:28:08.440]  I said, it's not a big deal. It's just, it's actually probably one of the quietest flu
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:15.560]  seasons we've had. So this whole idea that this, this particular H1N1 is a problem and
[2:28:15.560 --> 2:28:21.320]  that it needs to be dealt with when it turns around to your autumn or fall into your winter,
[2:28:21.320 --> 2:28:27.520]  it's just a total setup. It's so obvious because H1N1 is not a very deadly flu, but they're
[2:28:27.520 --> 2:28:28.520]  hyping it.
[2:28:28.520 --> 2:28:33.920]  Absolutely. They're hyping the vaccine. And just like with a smallpox shot in 2003, they
[2:28:33.920 --> 2:28:38.320]  tried to give first responders the shot, but so many died, they had to stop. And Tommy
[2:28:38.320 --> 2:28:42.400]  Thompson, the Health and Human Service Secretary, refused to take it. Good to hear from you
[2:28:42.400 --> 2:28:46.760]  there in Australia. Good day, sir. Please continue to spread the word about the transmission.
[2:28:46.760 --> 2:28:52.520]  We love the folks there in Australia. Bob Chapman, thanks for spending an hour and 20-plus
[2:28:52.520 --> 2:28:59.480]  minutes with us today. God willing, we'll see you back for an hour with us next Friday.
[2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:04.440]  Folks can go to theinternationalforecaster.com and get a free copy of the latest newsletter
[2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:08.600]  that comes out twice a week. And tomorrow is Saturday, folks. So request that by email
[2:29:08.600 --> 2:29:14.480]  there and folks will get it. Bob, thanks for your great info. We'll see you next week.
[2:29:14.480 --> 2:29:18.960]  You're welcome. And I'm looking forward to it. Take care, Bob. Okay. I'm going to break.
[2:29:18.960 --> 2:29:25.200]  I'm going to come back and get into the latest news of the U.S. military through Northcom,
[2:29:25.200 --> 2:29:29.600]  training to take on the American people on the Shulai Fourth and your phone calls and
[2:29:29.600 --> 2:29:36.160]  a big news blitz and a historian and researcher, amazing info coming up in the final hour.
[2:29:36.160 --> 2:29:42.120]  We've got an hour and a half left jam packed. We are live July 3rd, 2009. I listened to
[2:29:42.120 --> 2:29:47.000]  talk radio. It's almost all rebroadcast. Where is everybody? This is crazy. We should
[2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:52.960]  be on the air the day before July 4th, defending Liberty, resisting tyranny. We're on the March,
[2:29:52.960 --> 2:30:02.000]  the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones with
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:06.600]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer. Number
[2:30:06.600 --> 2:30:10.400]  one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number
[2:30:10.400 --> 2:30:15.280]  two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[2:30:15.280 --> 2:30:20.440]  you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:30:20.440 --> 2:30:25.400]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:30:25.400 --> 2:30:29.440]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[2:30:29.440 --> 2:30:33.600]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:38.680]  weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[2:30:38.680 --> 2:30:42.480]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[2:30:42.480 --> 2:30:50.200]  Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[2:32:02.560 --> 2:32:06.440]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[2:32:06.440 --> 2:32:10.640]  important than ever. We need to be independent, and food and water is the key. You'll never
[2:32:10.640 --> 2:32:14.200]  have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread. You'll never have to go to
[2:32:14.200 --> 2:32:18.840]  the superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family. In any emergency, if you simply
[2:32:18.840 --> 2:32:22.800]  prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you. You
[2:32:22.800 --> 2:32:27.600]  know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella,
[2:32:27.600 --> 2:32:31.760]  genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the cost of last
[2:32:31.760 --> 2:32:38.360]  year's grocery prices. Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com. Visit

[2:32:43.080 --> 2:32:47.440]  foods they have to offer. Watch the free videos. Look at their online catalog or give them
[2:32:47.440 --> 2:32:56.320]  a call at 1-800-409-5633. Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Take action
[2:32:56.320 --> 2:33:07.640]  today. The first step is getting storable food.
[2:33:07.640 --> 2:33:14.040]  More of your calls are coming up, and I start hyperventilating. I start getting upset because
[2:33:14.040 --> 2:33:18.680]  I take what's happening in this country very, very seriously. They have passed the House,
[2:33:18.680 --> 2:33:26.080]  the Hate Crimes Bill. We have a story titled Thought Crimes Bill Threatens Talk Radio.
[2:33:26.080 --> 2:33:32.040]  It has a subsection in S909 that says, if you hurt anyone's feelings, you'll be federally
[2:33:32.040 --> 2:33:39.520]  arrested. They need not even file a complaint. The feds will come out, no habeas corpus,
[2:33:39.520 --> 2:33:44.840]  and say you hurt someone's feelings. The Cyber Bullying Act has the exact same language.
[2:33:44.840 --> 2:33:50.840]  In fact, here's ABC News, Anti-Cyber Bullying Legislation Threat to Free Speech. This is
[2:33:50.840 --> 2:33:56.240]  not just us here that are saying this. We're going to talk about that with Kurt Nemo in
[2:33:56.240 --> 2:34:01.160]  a moment because he's a writer for MFullWords.com. He's the head editor at MFullWords.com. He's
[2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:06.360]  formerly written for big newspapers and TV stations, but he works on the team. I want
[2:34:06.360 --> 2:34:10.240]  him to go over that because he's been all over it. This is all really happening. The
[2:34:10.240 --> 2:34:14.640]  cap and trade socialists take over every facet of your life. That's really happening. The
[2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:19.840]  blanket total amnesty to legalize all the illegals, 20-plus million, including felons.
[2:34:19.840 --> 2:34:23.680]  That's happening. Same stuff Bush tried. Obama says he can do it. He's got the whole House
[2:34:23.680 --> 2:34:33.360]  and Senate. He's got a supermajority, 60 filibuster proof in the Senate with Franken
[2:34:33.360 --> 2:34:40.960]  getting in there. Now, Franken, the open borders, the socialist health care, government health
[2:34:40.960 --> 2:34:46.160]  care, the gun control, the cap and trade, giving the Federal Reserve unlimited power
[2:34:46.160 --> 2:34:53.080]  over all finance, all business from a taco or hot dog stand to a football stadium, everything.
[2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:58.320]  That's in that bill. It's all passing, all racing, all happening. This is it. They're
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:02.800]  making their move. Offshore banks are seizing the entire economy. We're going from free
[2:35:02.800 --> 2:35:10.800]  market to crony capitalism, robber barons, robber class. Now, if you're a new listener
[2:35:10.800 --> 2:35:14.200]  to the shows, I know we've gotten like five new affiliates the last two weeks alone. We're
[2:35:14.200 --> 2:35:18.400]  on XM now on the weekend. They rear the Friday show on Saturday evening there. We're very
[2:35:18.400 --> 2:35:21.920]  thankful to all that. The point is this show's got a lot of new listeners over 80 affiliates
[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:29.760]  now. The issue is for new listeners in China, in Russia, in Nazi Germany, in Venezuela,
[2:35:29.760 --> 2:35:34.720]  in Mexico, everywhere else is a tyranny. Liberty is incredibly rare. You never have trips
[2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:39.400]  on the streets. You never have people being arrested without warrants in a free society.
[2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:43.080]  You never have a big federal government in a free society. That's what the Fourth of
[2:35:43.080 --> 2:35:48.920]  July is about. We're going to get into that next hour, the history of it. It is not about
[2:35:48.920 --> 2:35:55.360]  just having a Chinese flag, an American flag made in China by slaves. By the way, they
[2:35:55.360 --> 2:35:59.520]  make the kids half the day in China in government school that you have to go to by law. They
[2:35:59.520 --> 2:36:04.280]  go work at a fireworks factory or a water hose factory or a factory making lawn equipment
[2:36:04.280 --> 2:36:09.600]  or a factory making furniture. That's what Mrs. Obama is going around doing, showing
[2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:14.800]  the kids working two, three hours a day of school, planting gardens in service, compulsory
[2:36:14.800 --> 2:36:20.720]  service bills are racing through for not just people 18 and older, everybody. And you've
[2:36:20.720 --> 2:36:24.760]  got to plant and grow the crops and give it to the government. That's the Soviet Union
[2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:29.840]  would make you on top of your government job. Come out five, 10, 15 hours a week and fix
[2:36:29.840 --> 2:36:36.200]  your sewage leak, dig ditches, break rocks. Folks, this is called slavery. And the big
[2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:40.600]  banks as Carol Quigley at Georgetown wrote Bill Clinton's mentors, they run communism
[2:36:40.600 --> 2:36:47.600]  and socialism and fascism. They want vertical integration, consolidation. It's really happening
[2:36:47.600 --> 2:36:52.200]  and it's all documented at info wars.com and prison planet.com. Now with all of that happening
[2:36:52.200 --> 2:36:57.080]  in this forced dependency and the free market being bankrupted by design to drive us into
[2:36:57.080 --> 2:37:03.000]  submission with all of this happening right now. And the fake neocon talk show host not
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:07.040]  talking about it or we're acting like it's just liberals doing it when both parties
[2:37:07.040 --> 2:37:14.920]  are on by the same people. With all of this going on, remember Arcadia, the Daily Times
[2:37:14.920 --> 2:37:19.960]  Harold reported and it made national news because we got on it and covered it. Remember
[2:37:19.960 --> 2:37:25.600]  that. Remember what happened? We had the Colonel on the air. They announced in the news, oh,
[2:37:25.600 --> 2:37:29.440]  we're going to go door to door and ask citizens to let us search their gun closets and to
[2:37:29.440 --> 2:37:33.600]  look at their guns. And then I had the Houston Chronicle where the feds knock on your door
[2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:40.120]  and have the local police do it all over the country from Chicago to Phoenix to Dallas.
[2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:44.320]  You could just say knock and talk. It's called knock and talk. It's a federal program federalizing
[2:37:44.320 --> 2:37:47.560]  your local police. They're already federalized. They come and knock, knock. Can we look at
[2:37:47.560 --> 2:37:52.680]  your guns in Boston and DC? They say, oh, we're just here to see if your kids have illegal
[2:37:52.680 --> 2:37:57.760]  guns. Mind if we come in? If you say no, they go ahead and force their way in. End of America,
[2:37:57.760 --> 2:38:02.640]  getting everybody used to gun confiscation. They have the gun buybacks for the $100 discount
[2:38:02.640 --> 2:38:07.560]  card. If you turn your gun in, all the images on the news of guns being turned in, they
[2:38:07.560 --> 2:38:12.320]  have bills to allow the attorney general to ban all guns he wishes. Any guns, all guns
[2:38:12.320 --> 2:38:18.840]  that he like. Now, you see the new greenhouse gas tax, the new carbon tax just says these
[2:38:18.840 --> 2:38:25.400]  30 plus government agencies can do whatever they want and regulate any carbon they want.
[2:38:25.400 --> 2:38:29.920]  See, it's no imperial power. Oh, the attorney general could ban any guns he wants. That
[2:38:29.920 --> 2:38:34.120]  bill's introduced. Oh, if you're on a no fly list, no judge, no jury, you're not arrested.
[2:38:34.120 --> 2:38:38.840]  No fly no buys the name of the law racing through the house. It says then we just magically
[2:38:38.840 --> 2:38:42.960]  put millions of Americans on a list where you can own guns and then they come and arrest
[2:38:42.960 --> 2:38:47.040]  you and swat team you and say, well, you didn't know you were on the list, but we see you
[2:38:47.040 --> 2:38:53.200]  as dangerous. We're going to go ahead and take your guns. That's Kafka S. That's right
[2:38:53.200 --> 2:38:59.200]  out of the Soviet Union or East Germany. It's happening. No judge, no jury. You're not told
[2:38:59.200 --> 2:39:02.640]  why you're being arrested. You're not allowed to get off the list. You're not told why you're
[2:39:02.640 --> 2:39:09.480]  on the list. This is 1984 on steroids. The feds with their new clean water restoration
[2:39:09.480 --> 2:39:15.120]  act, any above or below groundwater, any pools, any rainwater, 100% federalization of all
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:21.080]  land in the U. S. Racing through the Senate already left committee probably going to pass
[2:39:21.080 --> 2:39:26.280]  just nightmares untold animal ID premise society already passed already being enforced shutting
[2:39:26.280 --> 2:39:32.080]  down farms and ranches bureaucrats harassing hellish control. North com. We told you this
[2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:37.440]  years ago went to urban warfare drills when Clinton was in office, then Bush army, Navy,
[2:39:37.440 --> 2:39:44.360]  Marines training with foreign troops. And now in this national level exercise, oh, nine
[2:39:44.360 --> 2:39:48.000]  FEMA's own website. I covered it yesterday. In fact, people won't believe me. Print me
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:52.160]  national level exercise. Oh, nine from FEMA where it says all the foreign troops. I want
[2:39:52.160 --> 2:39:56.800]  that on screen. I want prison planet dot TV viewers and the radio listeners after listening
[2:39:56.800 --> 2:40:02.160]  to go Google the exact. This is the government's own site. Foreign troops training to take
[2:40:02.160 --> 2:40:08.400]  us on. But back in 99, I go to an urban warfare drill. You're tuning in thinking I'm weird
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:11.800]  because I'm excited about this. You're only supposed to get excited about NASCAR football
[2:40:11.800 --> 2:40:16.800]  and yelling scream. I'm excited about 1776 and our precious Republic has been paid for
[2:40:16.800 --> 2:40:23.680]  with so much blood. We're going to document that next hour with a story. This is I have
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:29.600]  a family here. My family's been here on the Mayflower. My family were signers of the Mayflower
[2:40:29.600 --> 2:40:38.320]  Compact. Ladies and gentlemen, okay, two of my ancestors, direct ancestors. I bleed red,
[2:40:38.320 --> 2:40:42.120]  white and blue. Yeah, print that for me. There it is on screen. National level exercise.
[2:40:42.120 --> 2:40:50.880]  And right there it says foreign troops right there. Third paragraph. Ladies and gentlemen.
[2:40:50.880 --> 2:40:56.160]  It says to suppress US terrorist. I remember reading the Toronto star in a Mexico City
[2:40:56.160 --> 2:41:00.520]  newspapers seven, eight years ago, where it would say, oh, we signed a deal to use Mexican
[2:41:00.520 --> 2:41:04.400]  and Canadian troops inside the US, but it would never be in the US. So I'd go to these
[2:41:04.400 --> 2:41:09.640]  drills even before that. And I'd witness foreign troops with a role player screaming.
[2:41:09.640 --> 2:41:13.520]  I'm an American and they'd say, where'd you get the gun? I'm from San Francisco. What
[2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:21.160]  militia are you with? I have videotaped. It's in my film, police state 2000 troops training
[2:41:21.160 --> 2:41:28.680]  to take your guns. Period. Now here we are 10, 11 years later and it's time you stop
[2:41:28.680 --> 2:41:34.960]  living in denial. Now it was in the daily Times Herald, butch, Heman, and it was in
[2:41:34.960 --> 2:41:40.240]  a bunch of other articles where they said they were going to go door to door doing gun
[2:41:40.240 --> 2:41:45.000]  confiscations, telling people, please let us in and look at your guns. Okay, there's
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:51.560]  the article. Now here is the news tribune out of Missouri, Camp Crowder, Missouri, and
[2:41:51.560 --> 2:41:58.240]  it says guard units trained for militia attacks. Now put up on screen the New York Times and
[2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:04.160]  you can go through the photos. Look at these. These are kids. And it says in this New York
[2:42:04.160 --> 2:42:09.520]  Times article, you scroll through right there, which is one through 14. It says right here
[2:42:09.520 --> 2:42:17.840]  in the article that they are training to take on disgruntled vets. And in the article, it
[2:42:17.840 --> 2:42:23.400]  describes them killing veterans. Then the DHS report we broke says veterans are the
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:29.640]  number one threat and Homeland Security setup for you. Last year DHS Homeland Security Army
[2:42:29.640 --> 2:42:35.160]  Times says we're going to use regular army against the American people. Then they have
[2:42:35.160 --> 2:42:40.480]  acclimation. They start putting local military liaison officers in every major department.
[2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:45.000]  Just Google the name of your town or your city and local military liaison officers in
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:51.880]  your intelligence unit spying on the citizens. You can't make this up. It's red dawn in
[2:42:51.880 --> 2:42:57.440]  slow motion. There are the kids practicing killing veterans on your screen. You cannot
[2:42:57.440 --> 2:43:04.240]  make this up. And then here it is. The long hours, the blistering heat and of course consistently
[2:43:04.240 --> 2:43:08.520]  having to come up with new ways of harassing the Missouri National Guard training in the
[2:43:08.520 --> 2:43:14.880]  area. Such was the case for several members of the headquarters attachment of the 229th
[2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:20.680]  malfunctioning medical battalion, multifunctional medical battalion. And it goes on to say they
[2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:26.280]  practiced taking on militias who were trying to kill the troops. Let's bring up Kurt Nemo
[2:43:26.280 --> 2:43:31.120]  who's writing a big article on this, writer from FullWars.com. Kurt, I mean this is really
[2:43:31.120 --> 2:43:35.600]  happening. And then they go, oh, all over the country. In fact, pull this up for people
[2:43:35.600 --> 2:43:41.720]  on screen. Marines at checkpoints with State Police, California. And you can, we can show
[2:43:41.720 --> 2:43:49.080]  you the chips, press release, armed Marines pulling citizens in Central California out
[2:43:49.080 --> 2:43:54.480]  of their cars with firearms, with breathalysers. And in Austin, they pull you out with these
[2:43:54.480 --> 2:44:01.080]  blank warrants, these fake warrants and suck your blood for DNA testing and all this crap.
[2:44:01.080 --> 2:44:05.800]  And now the media admits from birth for 36 years, everybody who's born had their blood
[2:44:05.800 --> 2:44:11.440]  taken and put in the Colesprings Harbor eugenics lab for the IBM human genome for race specific
[2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:16.320]  bio weapons. That's now mainstream news. The government's totally rogue, totally criminal.
[2:44:16.320 --> 2:44:20.800]  They do whatever they want. And I'm the same normal person. There it is. US Marines running
[2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:27.800]  California checkpoints, current.com. That's the local newspaper. And I mean, the newspaper
[2:44:27.800 --> 2:44:32.240]  saw Marines out with their weapons. This is America. And then they said, Oh, the army
[2:44:32.240 --> 2:44:37.320]  and the army times is going to help it car wrecks and fight DWI. You're not for car wrecks.
[2:44:37.320 --> 2:44:42.920]  Are you the army needs to help with the jaws of life. It's PR getting the troops used to
[2:44:42.920 --> 2:44:48.800]  it, the public used to it. But this says guard units training for the American people to
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:53.840]  attack them. This is mainstream news. Kurt Nemo, tell us what's happening. Well, the
[2:44:53.840 --> 2:44:59.200]  as you pointed out, the news tribune published an article on June 30 indicating that the
[2:44:59.200 --> 2:45:05.080]  National Guard out of Camp Crowder is setting up these, you know, had this simulated attack
[2:45:05.080 --> 2:45:11.720]  on their troops. Actually, what it is is a medical attachment to, as you noted, a medical
[2:45:11.720 --> 2:45:17.080]  attachment to the National Guard. What's interesting about this is that they say that the simulated
[2:45:17.080 --> 2:45:25.320]  attacks came on checkpoint set up by the National Guard, which is very interesting. Okay, continue
[2:45:25.320 --> 2:45:29.560]  to break that down. Go over this article. Well, they basically said it's interesting.
[2:45:29.560 --> 2:45:35.240]  This article is written by Celest Allen, who's attached to the military. The writers got a
[2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:40.520]  US Army military email address on the article. So this article was put in a local newspaper
[2:45:40.520 --> 2:45:45.720]  in Missouri, which is what the cybersecurity command in San Antonio says they're now going
[2:45:45.720 --> 2:45:52.840]  to engage in counter terrorist propaganda, just like they do in Iraq against us preparing
[2:45:52.840 --> 2:45:56.960]  for the American people to attack the army at checkpoints. So what that means is when
[2:45:56.960 --> 2:46:00.600]  the army is checking your national ID, pulling you out, sticking you in trucks to take you
[2:46:00.600 --> 2:46:06.320]  to FEMA camps as they publicly drill to do. That's the civilian inmate labor camp program
[2:46:06.320 --> 2:46:11.960]  at army.mil. If anybody fights back, it'll be on the news. Terrorists attack military
[2:46:11.960 --> 2:46:15.800]  today. It'll really be a family not letting them take their kids and put them in a FEMA
[2:46:15.800 --> 2:46:20.320]  bus. Just like in Baghdad, it's exactly the same thing. Just like Fallujah, please continue.
[2:46:20.320 --> 2:46:24.760]  So what's going to happen here is I predict that these are going to be increasingly common
[2:46:24.760 --> 2:46:29.920]  these, you know, brainwashing and training the National Guard to, you know, have these
[2:46:29.920 --> 2:46:34.600]  simulated wars with so-called insurgents as they're called in the articles and militants
[2:46:34.600 --> 2:46:41.240]  as they're called in the article. You know, as you mentioned, the DHS is conflated that
[2:46:41.240 --> 2:46:46.760]  you know, white supremacist and militia with constitutionalist supporters around Paul and
[2:46:46.760 --> 2:46:52.360]  Chuck Baldwin and, you know, so, you know, that's the terrorist. That's the militant
[2:46:52.360 --> 2:46:58.440]  or the constitutionalist and the patriot. Well, this is in the California papers. It's
[2:46:58.440 --> 2:47:03.600]  everywhere. This is in Missouri and this is where the Mayak report came out saying Ron
[2:47:03.600 --> 2:47:07.560]  Paul sticker, go ahead and arrest them. And no matter if we have the lieutenant governor
[2:47:07.560 --> 2:47:11.480]  have it removed and people get in trouble, they're going to continue this. And I remember
[2:47:11.480 --> 2:47:16.520]  an Austin American Statesman article about the new green jobs core and how they're going
[2:47:16.520 --> 2:47:20.680]  out and assessing what the carbon taxes should be on because they know the bill gives them
[2:47:20.680 --> 2:47:27.200]  unlimited power and it's run by a army psych warfare expert who helped set up the control
[2:47:27.200 --> 2:47:33.320]  grid in Afghanistan. So they have spooks openly going to rule us. I mean, these guys are
[2:47:33.320 --> 2:47:39.720]  going for broke, man. They are going for broke here, Kurt. Right. Right. Well, it's interesting
[2:47:39.720 --> 2:47:43.600]  with it'll be interesting to see what happens once they set up the checkpoints. They expect
[2:47:43.600 --> 2:47:47.480]  these the checkpoints to be attacked. I mean, obviously, if things get really bad when the
[2:47:47.480 --> 2:47:52.280]  economy goes down, they're going to have people probably will attack these checkpoints. Well,
[2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:55.960]  see, because they're going to shut down the highways. I mean, the army admits this and
[2:47:55.960 --> 2:47:59.560]  this is in the training I've went. I'm showing people real video where the Marines and I
[2:47:59.560 --> 2:48:05.440]  actually searched highways and real citizens in Swansboro in 2000. I mean, they show up
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:11.000]  at these quotes. Same thing was happening in Arcadia in Iowa. I mean, they go to people's
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:16.680]  listen, our camera guys in Hebron, Maryland, the Marines came over and pointed guns at
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:20.520]  them and said, turn your cameras off. And they were practicing taking over the city
[2:48:20.520 --> 2:48:25.040]  hall. That's what the John Warner Defense Authorization Act says is that they're the
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:29.520]  main thing is to take over the States. I mean, this is hot reason in front of everyone.
[2:48:29.520 --> 2:48:33.000]  They've been training them for decades, but now it looks like it's, yeah, here they are
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  in Hebron patrolling at night. And then they went and complained that we were videoing.
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:41.120]  So the troops walk up point, point a heavy at us and say, look, and they had the police
[2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:44.840]  back in a month. And they said, you don't take in America, you know, the coward home
[2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:50.360]  of the slave. So I can't believe this. I have police in the news tasering a Waffle House
[2:48:50.360 --> 2:48:55.200]  employee for fun. And the police are defending it and say, we're now going to taser you just
[2:48:55.200 --> 2:49:01.120]  for fun. I wanted to mention another aspect of this article is one of the role players
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:06.960]  for the so-called insurgent was whacker. He was arrested or captured. He's broken.
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:11.880]  He spoke in broken English. That's very interesting. They would put that in there because there
[2:49:11.880 --> 2:49:17.480]  was this report a couple of weeks ago where this so-called leader of the Taliban or Al-Qaeda
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:20.480]  said that they were going to team up with white supremacists in the United States and
[2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:23.600]  attack America. Well, yeah, this is the white Al-Qaeda we told
[2:49:23.600 --> 2:49:27.160]  people seven years ago. They're going to first get you to give up your rights to only hurt
[2:49:27.160 --> 2:49:31.560]  the brown people, the Taliban. And then the whole thing's really set up for the good
[2:49:31.560 --> 2:49:37.720]  old boys because it's the land grabbing ponytail brigade that runs all this. You're the real
[2:49:37.720 --> 2:49:43.120]  target fools. Well, look, the farmers and ranchers have got to be hit by him to know.
[2:49:43.120 --> 2:49:46.240]  And then they'll fight back and they're going to be called terrorists. But no, this is so
[2:49:46.240 --> 2:49:50.320]  when you're at a checkpoint, your kids are going in one truck with a pedophile CPS and
[2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:54.040]  you're going to another camp in the civilian inmate labor camp program. In fact, Google
[2:49:54.040 --> 2:49:59.320]  that civilian inmate labor camp program. We'll first show in that article, domestic
[2:49:59.320 --> 2:50:05.920]  militarization comes to San Bernardino County. It has direct links to the highway patrols
[2:50:05.920 --> 2:50:12.240]  own press release. Then this later got picked up in a local newspaper in San Bernardino.
[2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:17.440]  I mean, Kurt, this is really happening. And then now they have the army writing in local
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:21.840]  papers going be calm. We're in control. We're the U. S. Army. We're here locally to fight
[2:50:21.840 --> 2:50:26.840]  the militia, Al Qaeda. And when none of this is even going on, which means they're going
[2:50:26.840 --> 2:50:31.960]  to stage events very soon. We've been saying that now. Look at Von Brun. Look at Poplowski.
[2:50:31.960 --> 2:50:38.480]  Look at others. It's incredible. Isn't it, Kurt? Oh, yeah. And they integrate this article
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:46.800]  that the veterans will be with them as well. Oh, so it's saying that that that, oh, by
[2:50:46.800 --> 2:50:50.040]  the way, we're not against the veterans. Uh, they're going to be helping us. It says that
[2:50:50.040 --> 2:50:56.440]  they'll be using smoke grenades and other explosive improvised devices, you know, indicating
[2:50:56.440 --> 2:51:00.040]  that the military will be involved in it. Oh, of course, the military's got to kill
[2:51:00.040 --> 2:51:04.920]  us. Well, they're right back. You've probably heard about the incredible powerful and natural
[2:51:04.920 --> 2:51:10.520]  antioxidants found in red wine. Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine

[2:54:08.600 --> 2:54:12.600]  Folks, the majority of training for the military and the military police now is to take on
[2:54:12.600 --> 2:54:17.600]  the American people. This is high-treason. Offshore banks have seized the United States.
[2:54:17.600 --> 2:54:21.600]  Going back at least ten years at Kentucky Derby, they have regular army there searching
[2:54:21.600 --> 2:54:27.200]  for citizens. Then in my film, Marshal Law, we got video and photos from high school football
[2:54:27.200 --> 2:54:32.600]  games with the army. They're searching children and then the state guard and national guard
[2:54:32.600 --> 2:54:37.720]  from Alabama to Tennessee. Then a few months ago, we had the state rep on and the governor's
[2:54:37.720 --> 2:54:42.120]  statement, the army and the Air Force and the BATF were doing mock gun confiscation
[2:54:42.120 --> 2:54:46.600]  drills, shutting down major Tennessee highways, searching cars. The governor said, don't do
[2:54:46.600 --> 2:54:52.320]  it again. That weekend, the army went ahead and did it. In fact, Google that for viewers.
[2:54:52.320 --> 2:54:56.960]  Let's put that on screen for people. I can just go on with hundreds of examples. Military
[2:54:56.960 --> 2:55:03.520]  runs checkpoints in Tennessee and show people the photos from the local papers. Now, I'm
[2:55:03.520 --> 2:55:08.960]  sitting down at a restaurant at Waterloo Ice House with my wife and children, the TV's
[2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:15.320]  on, and it's the Kentucky Derby a month ago. We're not really paying attention. The horse
[2:55:15.320 --> 2:55:20.040]  is just one. I'm biting into the food. I look up and there are troops running out on the
[2:55:20.040 --> 2:55:25.480]  field tackling citizens that always jump off and run out. They didn't have police do it
[2:55:25.480 --> 2:55:33.040]  and they had 45s out. This is all illegal and they're to acclimate you to accept it.
[2:55:33.040 --> 2:55:38.360]  Kurt Nemo, do people realize that this is really happening and they're training to
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:44.040]  kill veterans? I don't even think most people even realize this. If you look at the newspaper
[2:55:44.040 --> 2:55:48.600]  the last couple of days in California on the 4th of July, they're going to take some attack
[2:55:48.600 --> 2:55:53.840]  helicopters and fly them up and down the coast during celebrations just to get people acclimated
[2:55:53.840 --> 2:55:58.240]  to having a military there. Remember the Alabama shooting when they had the troops show up
[2:55:58.240 --> 2:56:01.920]  and lock the city down hours after it was open? We announced it and people didn't believe
[2:56:01.920 --> 2:56:07.800]  us. Then later, there was an army investigation. Well, the Associated Press published a photo
[2:56:07.800 --> 2:56:12.400]  of it, but that was it. They didn't cover it in the media at all. Incidentally, in regard
[2:56:12.400 --> 2:56:16.640]  to that Tennessee thing, it wasn't just the military. It was also the Department of Homeland
[2:56:16.640 --> 2:56:22.600]  Security, the FBI, a bunch of federal agencies. They were all participating in that checkpoint.
[2:56:22.600 --> 2:56:30.320]  Yeah, it said 35 agencies. Right. I mean, we got photos of a whole highway shut down
[2:56:30.320 --> 2:56:37.320]  for miles and troops walking around. Yeah, we rule, baby. This Baghdad, bitch. I mean,
[2:56:37.320 --> 2:56:44.560]  I'm sorry, but I mean, this is treason. The 4th of July is 180 degrees from this for all
[2:56:44.560 --> 2:56:47.440]  of you out there that don't understand what America is all about. Kurt, does this make
[2:56:47.440 --> 2:56:51.800]  you sick like it makes me sick? No, it's disgusting. But what's really disgusting is this is not
[2:56:51.800 --> 2:56:55.480]  being covered by the media at all. You know, you got to pick up on local newspapers in
[2:56:55.480 --> 2:57:00.560]  Missouri and Tennessee to get these tips on what's really going on. It's done under the
[2:57:00.560 --> 2:57:06.440]  cover of, you know, the darkness. They don't let us know about it. They're also announcing
[2:57:06.440 --> 2:57:11.360]  on the 4th of July all over the country, checkpoints with the police and military. Sorry, go ahead.
[2:57:11.360 --> 2:57:14.160]  Right in California, they're going to set up a checkpoint to make sure people don't
[2:57:14.160 --> 2:57:17.640]  take their fireworks into the country's eyes. And it says it gives them a bunch of years
[2:57:17.640 --> 2:57:22.280]  in prison now for it. Yep, it's really severe. You know, Alex, in this article that's in
[2:57:22.280 --> 2:57:27.960]  this, um, Missouri newspaper, the, uh, the last couple paragraphs are interesting. They
[2:57:27.960 --> 2:57:33.520]  say that they're trying to make these simulated attacks as realistic as possible and that
[2:57:33.520 --> 2:57:37.720]  in the real situation, the military police would be there along with the, um, regular
[2:57:37.720 --> 2:57:42.840]  soldiers. So it happens what they're saying is that this is going to happen. They're
[2:57:42.840 --> 2:57:46.920]  training the soldiers that citizens are going to attack checkpoint and they're getting
[2:57:46.920 --> 2:57:51.760]  them ready for it.
[2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:56.960]  And why do the soldiers think that the American people who are in a coma would finally get
[2:57:56.960 --> 2:58:01.240]  up and fight you? God only knows.
[2:58:01.240 --> 2:58:05.320]  You'll be your family too, guys. That doesn't matter. Most of the military is illegal aliens
[2:58:05.320 --> 2:58:09.880]  and felons now. You know, that's admitted, Kurt. Well, like you said, I mean, you know,
[2:58:09.880 --> 2:58:12.640]  they're going to set up checkpoints. They're going to have this phony pandemic here in
[2:58:12.640 --> 2:58:18.840]  the fall and they're going to lock down cities and put up checkpoints. And that's what these
[2:58:18.840 --> 2:58:23.040]  national guard are going to be there for. And then probably it won't be a big deal.
[2:58:23.040 --> 2:58:26.840]  The pandemic won't be a big deal. And we'll say, see the army running things saved you
[2:58:26.840 --> 2:58:31.220]  and the precedent is set. Where'd Alex go? Oh, the army was here. Oh, that's normal.
[2:58:31.220 --> 2:58:36.240]  That's what landed the free home of the Braves all about having secret police troops. Unbelievable.
[2:58:36.240 --> 2:58:43.600]  Kurt Nemo stay there. Let's do five more minutes. We'll be right back.

[2:59:54.040 --> 3:00:23.260]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:23.260 --> 3:00:30.260]  We've got a guest coming up in the next segment. Kurt Nemo runs infowars.com. He's joining
[3:00:30.260 --> 3:00:38.000]  us. National level exercise 2009 NLE, Homeland Security FEMA with troops and personnel from
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:44.140]  Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom and other countries in NLE09. Kurt reported
[3:00:44.140 --> 3:00:50.680]  yesterday from a Pentagon press release the Israeli anti-terror forces are helping run
[3:00:50.680 --> 3:01:01.120]  that operation as well. This is really happening. This is really going on. They're really running
[3:01:01.120 --> 3:01:06.400]  acclimation with troops everywhere, running checkpoints, PR, running jaws of life, Army
[3:01:06.400 --> 3:01:11.160]  helicopters landed, car wrecks now. Oh, we're just the Army. It's all part of getting the
[3:01:11.160 --> 3:01:15.080]  troops feeling good about helping the citizens, getting the police used to it. Oh, it's the
[3:01:15.080 --> 3:01:19.080]  Army. That's kind of like when the police and the sheriff's department work together
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:26.160]  on the county line. Yeah, boy. And it's all foreign troops are here helping. After all,
[3:01:26.160 --> 3:01:31.560]  the biggest recruiting centers are now in Ukraine, Mexico City and Manila, Philippines,
[3:01:31.560 --> 3:01:36.280]  hiring felons, illegal aliens. The whole military is basically foreigners now. I mean,
[3:01:36.280 --> 3:01:41.720]  this is hellish, Kurt, and they openly train everywhere with the youth brigades and with
[3:01:41.720 --> 3:01:46.760]  the troops to take on veterans and gun owners. My God, Kurt, do you think they're planning
[3:01:46.760 --> 3:01:51.440]  to go ahead and just start a civil war? They're going to start hunting patriots down and forcing
[3:01:51.440 --> 3:01:55.240]  us to fight them? Well, we know history tells us that precisely what they're going to do.
[3:01:55.240 --> 3:02:00.600]  There's no national domestic care threat in this country. The only threat is the government,
[3:02:00.600 --> 3:02:08.200]  and they will set up false flag situations to do this so they can consolidate their power.
[3:02:08.200 --> 3:02:16.920]  Continue, Kurt. It's interesting. You see these little bits of news here and there on
[3:02:16.920 --> 3:02:24.320]  Memorial Day. The Marines used the helicopter to land in Staten Island in a park, and it's
[3:02:24.320 --> 3:02:27.840]  interesting to note that the citizens sat there and moved nod and clapped their hands
[3:02:27.840 --> 3:02:32.760]  as these soldiers jumped out in full battle gear. In fact, they were attacking Fallujah
[3:02:32.760 --> 3:02:38.120]  or something. It's insane. I just forgot. Whatever the big paper is in Fort Benning
[3:02:38.120 --> 3:02:46.240]  Georgia in that town, there were two big articles. MSNBC covered it too. In 2000, in the year
[3:02:46.240 --> 3:02:54.300]  2000, two special forces officers got killed or special forces trainees because they jumped
[3:02:54.300 --> 3:03:01.320]  out on police at road stops and tried to disarm the police, and the military thought that
[3:03:01.320 --> 3:03:05.600]  it was a real attack. So they've even gotten killed doing this.
[3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:08.720]  Yeah, it's like friendly fire. It happens. I mean, if they don't tell them what's going
[3:03:08.720 --> 3:03:13.120]  on, that's what's going to happen. The other one was 98 in Miami. Delta Force fired into
[3:03:13.120 --> 3:03:19.160]  a restaurant, into tables people were eating at. In Houston, in 98, Delta Force crashed
[3:03:19.160 --> 3:03:23.920]  helicopters in a drill. Maybe you should add that. When's your big report on this coming
[3:03:23.920 --> 3:03:27.640]  out at infowars.com? Well, I'll get back to work on it. I'll try to get off the phone
[3:03:27.640 --> 3:03:31.960]  with you by an hour or so. Okay, you've already got this article linked. Folks want to find
[3:03:31.960 --> 3:03:36.400]  it. Guard units trained for militia attacks. I've been kind of frothing and interrupting.
[3:03:36.400 --> 3:03:40.720]  In one minute left, we've got anything else. No, that's about it. It's just people need
[3:03:40.720 --> 3:03:46.360]  to around the country. It's interesting. We got this tip from an info wars reader. So
[3:03:46.360 --> 3:03:50.760]  they need to be if folks are seeing this kind of behavior or finding local press articles,
[3:03:50.760 --> 3:03:54.160]  they need to send them to us because we need to cover this point up. Well, I mean, I see
[3:03:54.160 --> 3:03:58.460]  articles every day sent to me by listeners where every police department has regular
[3:03:58.460 --> 3:04:05.200]  army and Marines in their offices, CIA setting up local offices, the news reports. I mean,
[3:04:05.200 --> 3:04:09.680]  they are taking over Kurt. Well, the CIA, the CIA has been doing that since the nineties
[3:04:09.680 --> 3:04:15.160]  that that's that's fully integrated now. There's CIA in police stations and so are the FBI.
[3:04:15.160 --> 3:04:19.160]  So they have that integrated already. Well, there's also the article where state police
[3:04:19.160 --> 3:04:25.040]  all over announcing they're fully federalized like in Arizona, right? And then every time
[3:04:25.040 --> 3:04:29.600]  we get a governor or state reps try to declare state sovereignty, the state police show up
[3:04:29.600 --> 3:04:34.000]  and start threatening them and following them like in Oklahoma. The state police also covers
[3:04:34.000 --> 3:04:39.440]  the fact that local police agencies are getting grenade launchers and automatic weapons from
[3:04:39.440 --> 3:04:43.080]  the Department of Homeland Security. God, they work for the foreign bankers. They're
[3:04:43.080 --> 3:04:47.480]  rolling this country. They are just taking us over hardcore. I mean, this is it. This
[3:04:47.480 --> 3:04:53.360]  is total occupation, total destruction, total takeover of the Republic. It's really happening.
[3:04:53.360 --> 3:04:58.360]  Police and military wake up, citizens wake up, saying no. Thanks, Kurt, memo and infowars.com.
[3:04:58.360 --> 3:05:04.280]  Stay with us. Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself
[3:05:04.280 --> 3:05:08.800]  this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted
[3:05:08.800 --> 3:05:13.720]  by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are
[3:05:13.720 --> 3:05:18.280]  present in municipal drinking water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer,
[3:05:18.280 --> 3:05:22.840]  reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases. Now, what are you going to do about
[3:05:22.840 --> 3:05:27.920]  it? The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[3:05:27.920 --> 3:05:32.160]  you and your family's drinking water. The Acola Blue 28 produces up to seven gallons
[3:05:32.160 --> 3:05:36.720]  of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration,

[3:06:09.560 --> 3:06:14.800]  quality superfood around, called Inner Food. My wife just loves the stuff. And now, the

[3:07:01.880 --> 3:07:06.960]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic. This very special mineral has been used for
[3:07:06.960 --> 3:07:11.680]  centuries by most cultures throughout the world. Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but
[3:07:11.680 --> 3:07:16.480]  mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in
[3:07:16.480 --> 3:07:21.520]  distilled water, without use of animal protein, nitrates or saline solutions. Because our
[3:07:21.520 --> 3:07:25.980]  colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the
[3:07:25.980 --> 3:07:32.120]  cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[3:07:32.120 --> 3:07:36.760]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold and copper,
[3:07:36.760 --> 3:07:41.160]  with a money-bag guarantee on the colloidal products we produce. For four years, Utopia
[3:07:41.160 --> 3:07:45.720]  Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given
[3:07:45.720 --> 3:07:54.240]  rights of health care and freedom of speech. Visit us today at utopiasilver.com, or call
[3:07:54.240 --> 3:08:02.240]  888-213-4338, 888-213-4338 and help us win this battle.
[3:08:02.240 --> 3:08:21.600]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:21.600 --> 3:08:27.520]  I was driving into the office this morning, and we had Bob Chetlin on the schedule, but
[3:08:27.520 --> 3:08:30.880]  I wanted to just have open phones today and talk about the founding of our country, the
[3:08:30.880 --> 3:08:36.240]  sacrifice our founders made. What the federal government is doing today is 180 degrees the
[3:08:36.240 --> 3:08:43.160]  opposite of what this country was set up to do. The things going on today are the opposite
[3:08:43.160 --> 3:08:49.880]  of liberty and freedom. We're being made to be domesticated, enslaved, cowardly creatures.
[3:08:49.880 --> 3:08:54.160]  And the globalists are a bunch of eugenicist control freaks that run the planetary government.
[3:08:54.160 --> 3:08:58.200]  And I heard somebody who I've read one of his books, meant to have him on in the past,
[3:08:58.200 --> 3:09:05.160]  never did it, Bill Federer with Americanminute.com. And I heard him, and I told my producer, try
[3:09:05.160 --> 3:09:10.600]  to get him. Well, he's with family, day before 4th of July, via cell phone from his car,
[3:09:10.600 --> 3:09:13.680]  but he's with us for the rest of the hour, and we're honored to have him because I heard
[3:09:13.680 --> 3:09:17.240]  him on Derry Brownfield here on the network, extremely powerful, and I've probably read
[3:09:17.240 --> 3:09:21.960]  more than 100 books on the Revolutionary War, the founders. I've done stuff like watch
[3:09:21.960 --> 3:09:28.400]  the HBO special, John Adams. I mean, I'm really into it. I know a lot of you are as well,
[3:09:28.400 --> 3:09:34.520]  but he really breaks down the starving ships, the slave ships, the concentration camps,
[3:09:34.520 --> 3:09:39.920]  the tyranny, the way we treated the British, the way they treated us, what the Declaration
[3:09:39.920 --> 3:09:44.840]  of Independence is all about, what our founding documents are really all about. On the 4th,
[3:09:44.840 --> 3:09:49.360]  this is what we should be remembering. Oh, the 4th means I eat a bunch of hamburgers,
[3:09:49.360 --> 3:09:53.640]  drink beer, and wave an American flag made by Chinese slaves, and I don't fight back
[3:09:53.640 --> 3:09:57.680]  against the carbon tax. I don't fight back against the federalization. I don't fight
[3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:03.760]  back against troops openly training domestically to set up martial law in the United States.
[3:10:03.760 --> 3:10:06.920]  So we're going to Bill Federer in just one moment. First, I want to tell you about a
[3:10:06.920 --> 3:10:13.000]  few of the sponsors that made this show possible today. One of them is the Acola Blue, the
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:19.200]  fabulous atmospheric water generator that grabs up to 7.5 gallons of water a day out
[3:10:19.200 --> 3:10:24.640]  of the atmosphere. No fluoride, no poisons, no nothing. Then it goes through 7 filters

[3:11:18.860 --> 3:11:23.200]  gun sales and ammo sales. It's important to really know how to use a firearm. Even if

[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:23.960]  So check that out today. Okay, I'm wound up, folks, because I just covered the U.S. military
[3:12:23.960 --> 3:12:28.640]  openly training to take on American gun owners. And I showed you the New York Times and other
[3:12:28.640 --> 3:12:33.320]  mainstream news showing youth brigades being trained for gun confiscation. That's not me.
[3:12:33.320 --> 3:12:37.880]  That's the New York Times saying it's good. The New York Times also reporting tattletale
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:41.800]  squads. The kids are being trained to write reports on their parents, taking a hot bath
[3:12:41.800 --> 3:12:47.640]  as a carbon crime. In fact, Google for folks, climate cops. I want them to people to see
[3:12:47.640 --> 3:12:51.600]  the red and black uniforms in England and the United States. We showed you this a year
[3:12:51.600 --> 3:12:55.160]  ago. Now they actually wear red and black uniforms. I mean, it's like I've woken up
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:13:00.560]  in the twilight zone. This is really happening. Soviet-style takeover is now happening. But
[3:13:00.560 --> 3:13:09.400]  Americanminute.com, Bill is just an amazing person. Bill Federer, William J. Federer is
[3:13:09.400 --> 3:13:15.400]  a nationally known speaker, best-selling author and president of the AmeriSearch Inc., a publishing
[3:13:15.400 --> 3:13:20.120]  company dedicated to researching America's noble heritage, the most noble. You can count
[3:13:20.120 --> 3:13:25.680]  on one hand the free societies and we're the best. Television and former U.S. Congressional
[3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:30.920]  candidate Bill has appeared on C-Span Fox, Henning Combs, Raleigh Factor, MPR, MSNBC,
[3:13:30.920 --> 3:13:35.280]  on and on and on, 700 Club. And he's just an amazing person. So I'm going to try to
[3:13:35.280 --> 3:13:41.440]  sit back, take a few calls at the end for him at 1-800-25-99231. But I'm wound up like
[3:13:41.440 --> 3:13:46.440]  a cheap clock here with the news I just covered. Sir, I heard you on Brownfield from a taped
[3:13:46.440 --> 3:13:51.520]  interview because Darry was off the day, really laying out the history I know, but you said
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:56.960]  it so well, how they put people's sons to die on starvation torture ships, throwing
[3:13:56.960 --> 3:14:02.840]  thousands of our ancestors off per month dead. I didn't hear you talk about it, but I remember
[3:14:02.840 --> 3:14:10.720]  reading about it, how they took the family of 11-year-old Andrew Jackson in the Carolinas.
[3:14:10.720 --> 3:14:14.120]  His daddy had died working the land. It was him and his mama and brothers starved him
[3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:18.640]  to death in the concentration camp. He wouldn't lick their boots, so they slashed him with
[3:14:18.640 --> 3:14:25.440]  a saber across the face. This is the tyranny of government. We're fighting. And we see
[3:14:25.440 --> 3:14:29.880]  the same arrogance, the same corruption today. And I want folks to know what the men and
[3:14:29.880 --> 3:14:33.960]  women, because the women went along with them and supported them, who signed that Declaration
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:37.720]  of Independence, what happened to them and what this country is really about. God bless
[3:14:37.720 --> 3:14:42.080]  you. Thanks for being here with us. Well, Alex, it's an honor to be on your program.
[3:14:42.080 --> 3:14:47.040]  And I've really appreciated all the great work you've done over the years. On the 4th
[3:14:47.040 --> 3:14:52.880]  of July, we do celebrate our great country's beginning. And it's important to look at the
[3:14:52.880 --> 3:15:00.320]  place in history. In other words, there's been about 5,000 years of recorded human history.
[3:15:00.320 --> 3:15:04.880]  That's all. Only about 5,000. That's 50 people living 100 years each near back to the beginning
[3:15:04.880 --> 3:15:10.440]  of the Egyptian hieroglyphic and Sumerian cuneiforms, little clay tablets. And during
[3:15:10.440 --> 3:15:15.880]  that 5,000 years, empires have risen and empires have fallen. Empires have risen and empires
[3:15:15.880 --> 3:15:22.560]  have fallen. But power has always been concentrated in the hands of Pharaohs, monarchs, sultans,
[3:15:22.560 --> 3:15:29.680]  czars, caesars, caesars. In other words, very few people held all the power. Well, America,
[3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:36.560]  we had 3,000 miles between us and our king, King George III, so we got a chance to experiment
[3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:41.600]  in self-government. They borrowed a lot from the church government because the different
[3:15:41.600 --> 3:15:45.840]  colonies were started by different denominations, you know, Virginia by the Anglican messengers,
[3:15:45.840 --> 3:15:49.880]  Massachusetts by Puritans, Rhode Island by the Baptists and so forth. And so they applied
[3:15:49.880 --> 3:15:54.800]  a little bit of this church government to their ideas of self-government and it worked.
[3:15:54.800 --> 3:15:59.960]  And so we became very prosperous. And we had, obviously, the revolution. And so what's
[3:15:59.960 --> 3:16:06.040]  happened is we went from the concentrated powers of the monarchs to the separated powers
[3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:11.040]  of our constitution, separated into three branches, separated from the federal to the
[3:16:11.040 --> 3:16:15.960]  state level and then tied up with 10 handcuffs, we call the first 10 amendments. But over
[3:16:15.960 --> 3:16:23.560]  time, power has gravitated toward re-concentrating. So in other words, it was great that Lincoln
[3:16:23.560 --> 3:16:29.240]  ended slavery. But in the process, he concentrated a lot of power away from the states. It was
[3:16:29.240 --> 3:16:33.200]  with the Wilson Goddess through World War I, but in the process, he concentrated power
[3:16:33.200 --> 3:16:37.400]  with the Federal Reserve and the Income Tax. Franklin Roosevelt got us through the depression
[3:16:37.400 --> 3:16:42.400]  in World War II, but he concentrated power with his new deal. Lyndon Johnson concentrated
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:47.920]  power with his socialist, great society programs. I mean, socialism is basically, I collect
[3:16:47.920 --> 3:16:51.760]  everybody's money, put it in a big bag, and you've got to come on bended knee, and I give
[3:16:51.760 --> 3:16:55.760]  it back to my friends. It's the old saying, whoever controls the purse strings has the
[3:16:55.760 --> 3:17:00.920]  power. But President Bush consolidated a whole lot of power in the war on terror and
[3:17:00.920 --> 3:17:07.000]  homeland security. And a lot of times, it's for an immediate good, but a long-term evil.
[3:17:07.000 --> 3:17:12.320]  In other words, withholding from your paycheck, that was an emergency effort to get money
[3:17:12.320 --> 3:17:19.280]  to fight Hitler. It was called a pay-as-you-go tax. And it was just a temporary thing to
[3:17:19.280 --> 3:17:24.080]  hurry up and win the war. Well, guess what? After the war stopped, it didn't. In other
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:28.560]  words, the federal government got this new power, and it never gave it up. Well, that
[3:17:28.560 --> 3:17:33.600]  power has been concentrated, and now it's all been handed over to the new president,
[3:17:33.600 --> 3:17:39.560]  and it's been put on steroids. And he's concentrating power, taking over banks and car companies
[3:17:39.560 --> 3:17:45.160]  and the health care. I mean, Hitler ran for office in Nazi Germany on promising nationalized
[3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:47.120]  health care. Anyway, I'm getting over it.
[3:17:47.120 --> 3:17:51.920]  And Bill, just to interrupt, this is how some tyrannies happen overnight, but generally
[3:17:51.920 --> 3:17:56.440]  with a society that was already used to being slaves and being bossed around, authoritarian.
[3:17:56.440 --> 3:18:03.280]  But with the case of Rome, it's golden era, very pious, focused on the law, and credit
[3:18:03.280 --> 3:18:07.640]  of their strength came from how pious they were. And by the end, it was hooking their
[3:18:07.640 --> 3:18:12.360]  wives out to be prostitutes, even the gentry, to try to raise money for the emperor, for
[3:18:12.360 --> 3:18:18.520]  the Caesar. And so it took a few generations to fully degenerate, but it always accelerates
[3:18:18.520 --> 3:18:24.640]  its degeneration. In just a few decades, most of the degeneration happens that took hundreds
[3:18:24.640 --> 3:18:30.520]  of years to build towards. Now we see more tyranny, more tyrannical laws, more federalization
[3:18:30.520 --> 3:18:37.200]  of water, open borders, the total Federal Reserve dictatorship. All of it is happening,
[3:18:37.200 --> 3:18:43.400]  the carbon tax, in just a few months. They're bum rushing us. It's all going to pure tyranny
[3:18:43.400 --> 3:18:44.400]  right now.
[3:18:44.400 --> 3:18:49.880]  Yeah, it's like water going down a drain around the edges. It goes very slowly, but as it gets
[3:18:49.880 --> 3:18:54.520]  close to the center, it goes faster and faster and faster. I mean, that's what happened with
[3:18:54.520 --> 3:18:58.080]  power as I talked about over history. It happened a little bit here, a little bit there, but
[3:18:58.080 --> 3:19:04.440]  now it's gone on an exponential curve. But you know, a founder's experience, the king
[3:19:04.440 --> 3:19:08.840]  of England was the king of their country, the commander of their military, and the head
[3:19:08.840 --> 3:19:13.840]  of their church. In other words, the king decided what the people could believe. It
[3:19:13.840 --> 3:19:18.680]  was like hate crime legislation. If you believe the way the king did, you were fine, but if
[3:19:18.680 --> 3:19:25.080]  you had other views, then you were not equal before the law.
[3:19:25.080 --> 3:19:29.520]  And they've now had the hate crime bill pass the house that says word for word. If you
[3:19:29.520 --> 3:19:34.600]  hurt somebody's feelings, you get arrested. So the end of the First Amendment, stay there.
[3:19:34.600 --> 3:19:40.640]  Let's get into the founding of our country with that Mayflower Compact that I had two
[3:19:40.640 --> 3:19:45.560]  family members that were signatories to, and then we will expand out from there with our
[3:19:45.560 --> 3:19:52.440]  guest what the founders went through and then how we rediscover this culture, because as
[3:19:52.440 --> 3:19:58.880]  this tyranny unfolds, we have to show the public what the alternative is, liberty versus
[3:19:58.880 --> 3:20:01.760]  the tyranny we're now seeing.
[3:20:01.760 --> 3:20:06.560]  It's a new year full of uncertainties. People are being laid off in record numbers. The
[3:20:06.560 --> 3:20:12.080]  price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter. You know that you need
[3:20:12.080 --> 3:20:17.080]  to prepare, and maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now. That's

[3:22:09.480 --> 3:22:16.360]  world government. It's known as the Builder-Bird. What their objective being world domination?
[3:22:16.360 --> 3:22:21.760]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world
[3:22:21.760 --> 3:22:30.560]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time

[3:23:00.560 --> 3:23:04.640]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[3:23:04.640 --> 3:23:09.400]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[3:23:09.400 --> 3:23:13.280]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[3:23:13.280 --> 3:23:16.760]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[3:23:16.760 --> 3:23:21.320]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[3:23:21.320 --> 3:23:27.520]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[3:23:27.520 --> 3:23:32.080]  of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[3:23:32.080 --> 3:23:36.200]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[3:23:36.200 --> 3:23:43.560]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com

[3:23:55.280 --> 3:24:18.760]  seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[3:24:18.760 --> 3:24:26.000]  If you don't think Neptune yet destroyed the economy, remember they told us that was going
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:30.200]  to make jobs. Imagine what their carbon tax is going to do. I've read their own documents
[3:24:30.200 --> 3:24:34.960]  here on air. IMF World Bank Club of Rome, it's designed to bankrupt things. They want
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:40.120]  you bankrupt. They want to vertically integrate. They're monopoly men. They're not free market.
[3:24:40.120 --> 3:24:44.800]  And they've created this banking crisis to do it. Arrest the bankers, and we do that
[3:24:44.800 --> 3:24:50.280]  by starting the audit of the Fed. It'll make Madoff look like a choir boy. Going back to
[3:24:50.280 --> 3:24:56.120]  Bill Federer with the website americanminute.com. Okay, Mr. Federer, there's a short segment
[3:24:56.120 --> 3:25:00.880]  long one coming up. Let's start now getting into that Mayflower Compact, and then the hell
[3:25:00.880 --> 3:25:05.480]  our forefathers went through to fight for this beautiful liberty we've had.
[3:25:05.480 --> 3:25:11.480]  Well, it's interesting that the pilgrims were going to land in Virginia, which was an Anglican
[3:25:11.480 --> 3:25:16.320]  colony. And they got blown off course, and they didn't want to just get off the boat
[3:25:16.320 --> 3:25:21.960]  and every man be a law unto themselves. So they decided to write their own government
[3:25:21.960 --> 3:25:26.480]  document, the Mayflower Compact. Now, the question is, how did they learn how to do
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:32.920]  this? Well, guess what? They were all dissenters. They were all basically religious nonconformists.
[3:25:32.920 --> 3:25:38.600]  So when they were in Holland, their pastor was a guy named John Robinson, and he taught
[3:25:38.600 --> 3:25:42.560]  them, if they have big decisions, they all fast and pray and vote. This was their church
[3:25:42.560 --> 3:25:48.400]  government. Well, they basically applied that to this Mayflower Compact. There's a line
[3:25:48.400 --> 3:25:54.240]  in there that says, having undertaken for the glory of God, the advancement of the Christian
[3:25:54.240 --> 3:25:58.920]  faith, avoids the plant, the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia. It says,
[3:25:58.920 --> 3:26:06.080]  mutually in the presence of God, we covenant ourselves together to form a civil body politic.
[3:26:06.080 --> 3:26:11.200]  And in fact, they all do submission to the laws that we passed. In other words, they
[3:26:11.200 --> 3:26:15.560]  submitted them to each other under God, and then created this government, and then agreed
[3:26:15.560 --> 3:26:20.200]  to submit to the laws. Well, they learned this from the church government. There's no
[3:26:20.200 --> 3:26:24.360]  other place that they could have learned it from. And this became a blueprint for Connecticut,
[3:26:24.360 --> 3:26:28.480]  which is called the Constitution State. And the Connecticut Constitution became a blueprint
[3:26:28.480 --> 3:26:32.560]  for the US Constitution, which starts off, we the people. So in other words, we're granting
[3:26:32.560 --> 3:26:38.120]  ourselves permission to start a government. That's right. Whenever we say, in the Declaration
[3:26:38.120 --> 3:26:41.760]  of Independence, you know, it talks about how it's our right, it's our duty to throw
[3:26:41.760 --> 3:26:46.440]  off tyranny. And when atheists get mad that we say it's God given, the point is it comes
[3:26:46.440 --> 3:26:53.520]  from no man. It is basic organic rights to be free creatures, sentient beings. And the
[3:26:53.520 --> 3:26:59.920]  first time we see this in history is what you're saying is the Mayflower Compact. They are
[3:26:59.920 --> 3:27:06.520]  granting among themselves to be governed by themselves by consenting to this law with
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:09.920]  each other. But I've read through every charter of every
[3:27:09.920 --> 3:27:16.200]  colony and each one of them, it's the monarch granting them permission. And in America, we're
[3:27:16.200 --> 3:27:21.080]  not like Canada or Australia, where they still acknowledge the monarch of England figure
[3:27:21.080 --> 3:27:27.120]  it at the figurehead. We simply grant ourselves permission. And the word that we don't have
[3:27:27.120 --> 3:27:32.320]  privileges that is something illegal that you're granted to do a license is authorization
[3:27:32.320 --> 3:27:36.360]  to do something that would be prohibited. So it's what a slave has. We are declaring
[3:27:36.360 --> 3:27:41.840]  that we are the sovereigns under God and no King but King Jesus. We're not worshiping
[3:27:41.840 --> 3:27:47.360]  King George III. Right. And the word federal means covenant. But you're bringing out a
[3:27:47.360 --> 3:27:54.120]  key point where in the Declaration says all men are created equal. This was revolutionary.
[3:27:54.120 --> 3:27:59.080]  All throughout history, there was not equality. If you were friends with the King, you were
[3:27:59.080 --> 3:28:04.200]  more equal. If you were enemies of the King, you weren't less equal. And so it's sort
[3:28:04.200 --> 3:28:09.440]  of like today where if you're friends with the party in power, you get more rights.
[3:28:09.440 --> 3:28:13.920]  You know, hate crime legislation, if you have that ideology. But if you believe in traditional
[3:28:13.920 --> 3:28:20.800]  values, guess what? You weren't less equal. And so it's interesting, I spoke at the U.S.
[3:28:20.800 --> 3:28:26.600]  Capitol. I did a half a dozen congressional staff briefings a year or so ago and they
[3:28:26.600 --> 3:28:32.760]  had congressmen's staffers and so forth. And afterwards I got a phone call from the Washington
[3:28:32.760 --> 3:28:37.800]  Post and the reporter said, are you trying to push Christianity on America? You know,
[3:28:37.800 --> 3:28:42.000]  like having secret meetings in the Capitol. And I said, well, can I ask you a question?
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:47.440]  I said, where did the idea of equality come from? And the reporter said, well, I don't
[3:28:47.440 --> 3:28:52.000]  know. I said, well, it didn't come from Islam, did it? I mean, in Islam, infidels are not
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:56.920]  equal to Muslims. Women are not equal to men. It takes two women to testify in court against
[3:28:56.920 --> 3:29:01.840]  one man. A woman can have the inheritance that a man gets. You know, a man can have
[3:29:01.840 --> 3:29:05.240]  four wives, a woman can't have four husbands. Of course, I don't know which woman would
[3:29:05.240 --> 3:29:10.160]  want four husbands, but nevertheless, there's not equality. I said equality did not come
[3:29:10.160 --> 3:29:16.520]  from Hinduism, where they have the caste system. And if you're an untouchable and that lowest
[3:29:16.520 --> 3:29:20.640]  caste, you're less than human. You have to take care of the garbage, clean the toilets,
[3:29:20.640 --> 3:29:25.640]  live outside of town. You're not equal to the Brahmin, the Brahmin in their divinity.
[3:29:25.640 --> 3:29:31.080]  And then in the atheistic police, if you are useful to the state, you work more. In America,
[3:29:31.080 --> 3:29:36.640]  you're equal no matter what. All right, stay there. What comes to mind today, though, is
[3:29:36.640 --> 3:29:41.480]  in California, over a million state workers and police are above the law. They can't be
[3:29:41.480 --> 3:29:45.600]  pulled over. They can't be given tickets. The photo enforcement can't work on them at
[3:29:45.600 --> 3:29:51.760]  toll roads and red light cameras because the computers can't read their plates.
[3:29:51.760 --> 3:30:01.480]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.480 --> 3:30:05.880]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:30:05.880 --> 3:30:10.120]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[3:30:10.120 --> 3:30:15.360]  bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:30:15.360 --> 3:30:20.080]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[3:30:20.080 --> 3:30:24.440]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[3:30:24.440 --> 3:30:28.280]  is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number
[3:30:28.280 --> 3:30:32.560]  four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands
[3:30:32.560 --> 3:30:36.920]  of families lose their power from weather related outages. Number five, a solar power
[3:30:36.920 --> 3:30:41.160]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe
[3:30:41.160 --> 3:30:45.840]  in the solar power generators offered by Solution from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[3:33:38.480 --> 3:33:43.160]  I wanted to read just the first page of the Declaration of Independence on July 4th. This
[3:33:43.160 --> 3:33:47.960]  is in official Homeland Security documents. This pocket constitution is considered terrorist
[3:33:47.960 --> 3:33:54.640]  manual. I have video in my film Road to Terrany from a squad car where they find this exact
[3:33:54.640 --> 3:33:58.960]  manual that we put free in all our orders and they find some of my videos and they arrest
[3:33:58.960 --> 3:34:04.840]  her for this. It's the police on tape finding this and getting scared. Now they've sworn
[3:34:04.840 --> 3:34:10.120]  an oath to this but they're so brainwashed they get scared. Now not all police are this
[3:34:10.120 --> 3:34:17.280]  dumb but the general public overall has been dumbed down. In Congress on July 4th, 1776,
[3:34:17.280 --> 3:34:21.840]  this is what America is about, folks. Not about football or mom and apple pie. It's about
[3:34:21.840 --> 3:34:27.760]  this. The Anonymous Declaration of the 13 United States of America. When in the course
[3:34:27.760 --> 3:34:33.880]  of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which
[3:34:33.880 --> 3:34:39.120]  have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate
[3:34:39.120 --> 3:34:44.880]  and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitles them a decent
[3:34:44.880 --> 3:34:51.160]  respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the cause which impels
[3:34:51.160 --> 3:34:57.200]  them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created
[3:34:57.200 --> 3:35:02.000]  equal and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain and amenable rights that among
[3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:07.560]  these are life-liberating the pursuit of happiness and that to secure these rights governments
[3:35:07.560 --> 3:35:15.000]  are instituted among men. That's us. Deriving their just powers from the consent of the
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:20.520]  governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the
[3:35:20.520 --> 3:35:26.080]  right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government. Laying
[3:35:26.080 --> 3:35:34.600]  its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem
[3:35:34.600 --> 3:35:40.160]  most likely to affect their safety and happiness. Prudence indeed will dictate that governments
[3:35:40.160 --> 3:35:45.920]  long established should not be changed for light or transient causes and accordingly
[3:35:45.920 --> 3:35:54.400]  all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable
[3:35:54.400 --> 3:36:00.120]  than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when
[3:36:00.120 --> 3:36:07.320]  a long train of abuses and usurpations what's happening today pursuing inevitably the same
[3:36:07.320 --> 3:36:14.960]  object invents a design to reduce them under absolute despotism just goes on and on. They're
[3:36:14.960 --> 3:36:20.560]  setting up tyranny scientifically to suppress us and lie and cheat and steal the votes.
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:26.840]  It is their right. It is their duty to overthrow and to throw off such government and to provide
[3:36:26.840 --> 3:36:33.240]  new guards for their future security such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:39.320]  and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government.
[3:36:39.320 --> 3:36:45.760]  To history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations
[3:36:45.760 --> 3:36:53.320]  all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states.
[3:36:53.320 --> 3:36:58.520]  To prove this let the facts be submitted to a candid world and then it goes over the
[3:36:58.520 --> 3:37:03.360]  tyrannies that have been set up and you look at these tyrannies it's exactly what's being
[3:37:03.360 --> 3:37:07.040]  done today but even worse today. Okay I'm going to sit back now because I want to take
[3:37:07.040 --> 3:37:13.480]  a few calls in a few minutes but a bill try to go over historically what the founders
[3:37:13.480 --> 3:37:19.960]  did how they were persecuted for putting their John Hancock's on that Declaration of Independence
[3:37:19.960 --> 3:37:26.720]  230 plus years ago today, tomorrow. Well it's a little background that the French
[3:37:26.720 --> 3:37:33.520]  Indian War took place 1754 to 1763 and the British won and decided to keep troops in
[3:37:33.520 --> 3:37:38.640]  America and make the Americans pay for these troops. Well they didn't have barracks and
[3:37:38.640 --> 3:37:41.600]  so they would simply come up to your house that they guess what we're going to have
[3:37:41.600 --> 3:37:46.240]  the troops stay in your house you live in the attic or the barn and so they began to
[3:37:46.240 --> 3:37:52.160]  pass taxes the sugar tax the currency act the stamp tax the quartering act and all these
[3:37:52.160 --> 3:37:58.880]  and the colonies had no representation in parliament and so it was no taxation without
[3:37:58.880 --> 3:38:04.920]  representation and so that's when we had the Boston Tea Party and so forth and the British
[3:38:04.920 --> 3:38:10.720]  responded by blockading Boston Harbor and then there was the Battle of Bunker Hill Thomas
[3:38:10.720 --> 3:38:17.380]  Jefferson over in Virginia the promotes a day of fasting and prayer in the Virginia
[3:38:17.380 --> 3:38:22.400]  Legislature and the Royal Governor takes this as an insult to the king and disbands the
[3:38:22.400 --> 3:38:26.880]  Virginia Legislature the House of Burgesses and so that's when they set up a Continental
[3:38:26.880 --> 3:38:30.960]  Congress and the first act to the courts of the Continental Congress was to open with
[3:38:30.960 --> 3:38:38.240]  prayer it's interesting how they're trying to outlaw that today but then Washington was
[3:38:38.240 --> 3:38:43.600]  put in command there at Boston he had twenty six-year-old Henry Knox go up to Fort De
[3:38:43.600 --> 3:38:48.520]  Condoroga and bring down a bunch of cannon and they put straw on the wheels so they
[3:38:48.520 --> 3:38:53.880]  could put them in place without it making any noise and the doorchester hikes the next
[3:38:53.880 --> 3:38:58.360]  day the British wake up see these cannons staring down their throat and so the British
[3:38:58.360 --> 3:39:04.240]  evacuate Boston it's a great rejoicing and the British are going to New York and so
[3:39:04.240 --> 3:39:09.520]  George Washington goes to New York he has twenty thousand volunteers the declaration
[3:39:09.520 --> 3:39:14.360]  is written that he read as it read to his troops there's great enthusiasm but the British
[3:39:14.360 --> 3:39:19.200]  fill up the harbor four hundred ships in the New York Harbor they say it was just like
[3:39:19.200 --> 3:39:23.440]  look like a forest full of trees because all the masks and then the British begin to pound
[3:39:23.440 --> 3:39:28.600]  away and Washington's men freak out and start fleeing he's trying to rally them back they
[3:39:28.600 --> 3:39:33.320]  have to drag Washington from the field because he doesn't want to leave but his troops retreat
[3:39:33.320 --> 3:39:38.640]  but retreat across Manhattan retreat across New York retreat across New Jersey and retreat
[3:39:38.640 --> 3:39:43.240]  across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania within six months Washington's troops dwindle
[3:39:43.240 --> 3:39:48.520]  from twenty thousand down to two thousand the Continental Congress sends him his last
[3:39:48.520 --> 3:39:54.080]  order up to that point that says until further notice you're in charge of America and the
[3:39:54.080 --> 3:39:59.120]  Continental Congress packs up shopping leaves and here's Washington it's all resting upon
[3:39:59.120 --> 3:40:05.120]  him and his men had only volunteered for six months so July to December guess what he had
[3:40:05.120 --> 3:40:10.200]  one week before they were all going to leave and Washington proves his worth he orders
[3:40:10.200 --> 3:40:15.120]  an attack Christmas day evening surprises the German Hessians and captures a thousand
[3:40:15.120 --> 3:40:20.080]  of them ten days later wins the battle of Princeton and this begins the turn in the
[3:40:20.080 --> 3:40:27.160]  course of the war but it's interesting they voted for independence on July second and
[3:40:27.160 --> 3:40:32.440]  that's the day that John Adams thought was going to be celebrated with bonfires and illuminations
[3:40:32.440 --> 3:40:38.640]  and follow max of devotion to Almighty God that's when they voted for it on July fourth
[3:40:38.640 --> 3:40:45.440]  only two people signed John Hancock the president of the Continental Congress he signed very
[3:40:45.440 --> 3:40:51.040]  large and said now the king of England can read my signature without using his spectacles
[3:40:51.040 --> 3:40:56.160]  his glasses and he said the price on my head is just double and so that's where it came
[3:40:56.160 --> 3:41:00.520]  up came to the phrase they'll put your John Hancock here you know and then Charles Thompson
[3:41:00.520 --> 3:41:05.120]  the secretary of the Continental Congress the rest didn't sign till August second when
[3:41:05.120 --> 3:41:10.480]  they had an engrossed copy and really a third of them didn't sign until six months later
[3:41:10.480 --> 3:41:14.960]  they had to come back to Philadelphia just to sign it and they weren't in a big hurry
[3:41:14.960 --> 3:41:19.280]  because they knew they were signing their death warrant the sun never set on the British
[3:41:19.280 --> 3:41:24.880]  Empire it was most powerful empire in the world they had the American colonies Canada
[3:41:24.880 --> 3:41:29.520]  they had Jamaica and British Guyana and Bermuda they had the Sandwich Islands Hawaii they
[3:41:29.520 --> 3:41:34.640]  had Hong Kong and India and I mean it was it was huge and so this was a pretty bold
[3:41:34.640 --> 3:41:41.240]  statement I'd like to say that our founders were willing to pledge their prosperity for
[3:41:41.240 --> 3:41:46.000]  their prosperity they pledged their lives and their fortune to their sacred honor well
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:50.160]  that's what they talked about they understood that life was transitory it was about an idea
[3:41:50.160 --> 3:41:54.400]  and doing something nobody'd ever done before and in England if you challenge them in any
[3:41:54.400 --> 3:41:59.480]  way they would lock you up to starve to death in the elements and then leave the skeletons
[3:41:59.480 --> 3:42:03.880]  up all over the place and then after the bones collapse they'd put a new person in there
[3:42:03.880 --> 3:42:09.760]  or they'd cut your head off and put it on a spike at the London Bridge and and so later
[3:42:09.760 --> 3:42:13.640]  and this is on record I've read all these history books this is a fact the British would rape
[3:42:13.640 --> 3:42:19.240]  your wives kill your family or starve you to death and just dumping thousands of bodies
[3:42:19.240 --> 3:42:25.320]  a month into the water I want to tell people about the starvation ships because I mean
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:31.160]  this is the evil we're fighting go ahead well you're right you know our founders put their
[3:42:31.160 --> 3:42:34.440]  lives and their fortune there in their sacred honor they've sacrificed their prosperity
[3:42:34.440 --> 3:42:38.800]  for their prosperity today we're sacrificing our prosperity for prosperity and settling
[3:42:38.800 --> 3:42:42.360]  our kids with the world's greatest debt and getting nothing though actually destroying
[3:42:42.360 --> 3:42:50.000]  our prosperity now thinking we sold our posterity for our prosperity we lost both but those British
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:54.680]  starving ships when Americans captured when when Washington captured those German Hessian
[3:42:54.680 --> 3:42:59.400]  troops with Trenton he took them across the Delaware and on their promise not to raise
[3:42:59.400 --> 3:43:04.120]  arms against America again he let him go and that's where a lot of the Germans in Pennsylvania
[3:43:04.120 --> 3:43:10.240]  came from but in contrast the British took the American Patriots put him in the prison
[3:43:10.240 --> 3:43:16.560]  turned churches in the prison turned schoolhouses in the prison and then he had starving ships
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:21.440]  these were like the Jersey was the name of one of the ships more Americans died on the
[3:43:21.440 --> 3:43:29.680]  British starving ships then died in battle against the British 4,000 died in battle 13,000
[3:43:29.680 --> 3:43:35.240]  died on these starving ships and so the British put him in there and wouldn't feed him one
[3:43:35.240 --> 3:43:40.880]  of the signers of the declaration his name was Abraham Clark and he had two sons in
[3:43:40.880 --> 3:43:45.840]  prison and the British said well if you'll take your name off that declaration we'll
[3:43:45.840 --> 3:43:52.000]  free your son but he said I cannot take my name off and God help my son and of the 50's
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:57.440]  let me stop you're right there Bill I gotta be honest with my three kids I'm ready to
[3:43:57.440 --> 3:44:04.120]  die for this and and I've said I put my family on the line for all this because I have to
[3:44:04.120 --> 3:44:08.720]  be at a certain point give them to God because I can't let myself let them ever be something
[3:44:08.720 --> 3:44:13.400]  that can be used against me or then the establishment might go after them but still to know your
[3:44:13.400 --> 3:44:19.280]  kids are out on a boat they're gonna be starved to death and thrown into the ocean with pleasure
[3:44:19.280 --> 3:44:25.360]  by the Empire I mean that just took incredible will and commitment what ended up happening
[3:44:25.360 --> 3:44:32.160]  to his sons well it took a long time but they finally were gotten back in a prisoner exchange
[3:44:32.160 --> 3:44:36.400]  but that wasn't the fate that happened to Francis Lewis's wife Francis Lewis was from
[3:44:36.400 --> 3:44:43.080]  New York he signed a declaration of independence his wife was captured by the British and imprisoned
[3:44:43.080 --> 3:44:48.240]  and kept in freezing weather without a change of clothes for six months with hardly any
[3:44:48.240 --> 3:44:52.040]  food and they saw that she was about to die so they let her go and she died within a
[3:44:52.040 --> 3:44:56.640]  month I was about to stop you that was their little trick a lot of times especially with
[3:44:56.640 --> 3:45:01.560]  little kids Andrew Jackson's mother and brother they let him go and they died one two days
[3:45:01.560 --> 3:45:07.800]  later one a week later so they starve you like a concentration camp victim they had
[3:45:07.800 --> 3:45:12.560]  his mother and brother in a church concentration camp that was their British term for it they
[3:45:12.560 --> 3:45:17.320]  invented it for those that don't know and then they took them on what on wagon back
[3:45:17.320 --> 3:45:22.520]  and put them out to die at their house go ahead well and then there's John Hart he signed
[3:45:22.520 --> 3:45:27.280]  a declaration of independence and was it his wife dying bedside when they ran in and said
[3:45:27.280 --> 3:45:32.240]  the British are coming he had to flee the British burnt his house chased away his kids
[3:45:32.240 --> 3:45:37.640]  he had to live in fields and in caves and his broke his health and he died before the
[3:45:37.640 --> 3:45:43.520]  war was ended that was John Hart then there was Richard Stockton popular guy in New Jersey
[3:45:43.520 --> 3:45:49.680]  chief justice of their colonial supreme court but the British offered amnesty whoever would
[3:45:49.680 --> 3:45:55.400]  return to being a politically correct loyalist and so one of Richard Stockton's neighbors
[3:45:55.400 --> 3:46:00.680]  led the British to capture him when he when he was escaping at that trader and so Richard
[3:46:00.680 --> 3:46:06.840]  Stockton was put in the freezing cold treated with severity because he was one of the signers
[3:46:06.840 --> 3:46:11.840]  he was brutalized is the library which was one of the greatest America was destroyed
[3:46:11.840 --> 3:46:20.440]  his money he had in continental currency which became worthless and he was released the government
[3:46:20.440 --> 3:46:26.360]  never paid him back he didn't get any stimulus bail out and he died bankrupt at 51 years
[3:46:26.360 --> 3:46:33.800]  old in 1781 what about some of the famous British massacres to putting people in buildings
[3:46:33.800 --> 3:46:40.040]  and killing them burning them well one of them was a gentleman Johnny per coin landed
[3:46:40.040 --> 3:46:47.880]  in Canada and was coming down from New York and he got the Indians to enter into a treaty
[3:46:47.880 --> 3:46:54.120]  and it actually referred to him in the declaration of independence where he basically told the
[3:46:54.120 --> 3:47:00.280]  Indians a lot and terrorized the American well one of the stories was that the Indians
[3:47:00.280 --> 3:47:06.600]  couldn't tell who was a loyalist and who was an American and David Jones left his New
[3:47:06.600 --> 3:47:12.680]  York village and went to join Johnny per coin and told his fiance Jane McCrary that he would
[3:47:12.680 --> 3:47:22.280]  come back for well close one evening the Indians came into the camp their scalp and one of them
[3:47:22.280 --> 3:47:29.880]  was the long red hair that David Jones recognized belong to his fiance Jane McCrary and so she
[3:47:29.880 --> 3:47:33.360]  had been they were fighting over who would get her scalp or then they killed her and
[3:47:33.360 --> 3:47:38.080]  just cut it off and so that gentleman Johnny per coin had to go and tell these Indians
[3:47:38.080 --> 3:47:43.080]  to cool it and they got offended and left and so here is we're going and band in the
[3:47:43.080 --> 3:47:49.200]  middle of the New York forest and the Americans finally surrounded and win the battle of Saratoga
[3:47:49.200 --> 3:47:56.360]  but this is where we see that the declaration talks about how the king is inside of the
[3:47:56.360 --> 3:48:02.880]  natives of the frontier to put your inhabitants of our colonies but over and over again another
[3:48:02.880 --> 3:48:10.920]  one was John Witherspoon he was the one clergyman to sign the Declaration of Independence they
[3:48:10.920 --> 3:48:17.280]  burnt his college Princeton was the college he was the president of and his son James
[3:48:17.280 --> 3:48:22.400]  Witherspoon died in the battle of Germantown there in Pennsylvania a little interesting
[3:48:22.400 --> 3:48:27.760]  trivia Reese Witherspoon is a distant descendant of John Witherspoon that the actors there
[3:48:27.760 --> 3:48:35.360]  but we see that they paid this price to have their names on that document one interesting
[3:48:35.360 --> 3:48:43.280]  story is John Adams he was the first US ambassador after the war to the king of England and he
[3:48:43.280 --> 3:48:49.960]  made international news when he refused to bow to the king I mean here's a former subject
[3:48:49.960 --> 3:48:55.560]  of the king but now he's an American citizen and he goes in there and doesn't bow he had
[3:48:55.560 --> 3:49:00.920]  a backbone of steel and so that's that the president that no American president or any
[3:49:00.920 --> 3:49:06.920]  representative of America would ever bow to any other monarch until of course President
[3:49:06.920 --> 3:49:15.120]  Obama bowed to King Abdullah but we see that the founders they vehemently wanted to defend
[3:49:15.120 --> 3:49:20.680]  their independence and that's why I'm sure that they would be turning in their graves
[3:49:20.680 --> 3:49:26.680]  when they would see this power taken away you know our founders bathe themselves in
[3:49:26.680 --> 3:49:32.480]  philosophers that talked about how to separate power again they took the powers of the monarch
[3:49:32.480 --> 3:49:36.160]  broke them into three branches they separated from the federal for the state level tied
[3:49:36.160 --> 3:49:42.160]  up with ten handcuffs they called the first ten amendments and but there were other philosophers
[3:49:42.160 --> 3:49:48.400]  that wanted to concentrate power one of them was Machiavelli he lived 500 years ago in
[3:49:48.400 --> 3:49:54.040]  Italy and Italy wasn't Italy Italy was a bunch of little kingdoms and dooms and papal states
[3:49:54.040 --> 3:49:58.640]  and they're always fighting each other then is fighting Genoa fighting sienna fighting
[3:49:58.640 --> 3:50:04.880]  his easy fighting perusia and so Machiavelli said you know if one prince could control
[3:50:04.880 --> 3:50:11.160]  all of Italy it would stop all this in fighting so he wrote a book called the prince for Lorenzo
[3:50:11.160 --> 3:50:18.040]  the Medici a rich guy in Florence and in it he advocated the end justifies the means in
[3:50:18.040 --> 3:50:24.120]  other words if the prince wanted to capture a city but the people didn't want him to well
[3:50:24.120 --> 3:50:30.240]  if he goes in there the people will hate him but if the prince pays insurgents to kill
[3:50:30.240 --> 3:50:35.120]  cows burn barns create terror the people will cry out for help the prince will come in and
[3:50:35.120 --> 3:50:38.880]  kill the guy that he bribed and everybody will treat the prince like a hero so it's
[3:50:38.880 --> 3:50:44.080]  good marketing he creates the need and kill it so we're talking about government sponsored
[3:50:44.080 --> 3:50:49.760]  terrorism with Machiavelli talking about it which the big neocons say that is their top
[3:50:49.760 --> 3:50:55.880]  teacher final segment few final calls we've got to have the american minute dot com gentlemen

[3:51:10.120 --> 3:51:14.480]  very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells

[3:56:43.560 --> 3:56:49.200]  know um we'll think this is foresaw that his farewell address is almost prophetic uh he's
[3:56:49.200 --> 3:56:56.520]  been uh stepped down from office in 1796 and he warned he said a fatal tendency to put in
[3:56:56.520 --> 3:57:01.640]  the place of the delegated will the will of the party often a small and artful and enterprising
[3:57:01.640 --> 3:57:09.120]  minority he goes on to say lastly to become potent engines by which cunning ambitious
[3:57:09.120 --> 3:57:15.640]  unprincipled men will subvert the power of the people and you serve for themselves the
[3:57:15.640 --> 3:57:22.640]  reins of government destroy afterward the very engines that lifted them to the unjust
[3:57:22.640 --> 3:57:28.840]  in george washington goes on to say this leads to a formal and permanent despotism and i
[3:57:28.840 --> 3:57:35.480]  love this part he goes to disorders and misery that result gradually inclined the minds of
[3:57:35.480 --> 3:57:42.840]  men to seek security in the absolute power of an individual who turns this dispossessed
[3:57:42.840 --> 3:57:47.880]  disposition to his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty but he anticipated there
