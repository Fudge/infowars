[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:12.600 --> 00:19.720]  University numbers show us that governments killed, conservatively, according to what
[00:19.720 --> 00:27.060]  study you look at, between 200 and 300 plus million people in the 20th century.
[00:27.060 --> 00:33.040]  That practice is called democide, and there's been a big body of work put out by several
[00:33.040 --> 00:37.920]  professors at the University of Hawaii.
[00:37.920 --> 00:43.920]  The reason I open the broadcast up with that is a lot of people are in denial out there,
[00:43.920 --> 00:49.000]  and they don't think that a nuclear war or a new world war could happen, even though
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.480]  most mainline historians, most futurists, most analysts say that we're closer to that than
[00:54.480 --> 00:56.880]  we've ever been.
[00:56.880 --> 01:01.320]  And then you've got neocons like John McCain and others that have had the Pentagon put out
[01:01.320 --> 01:07.320]  policy reports the last decade legitimizing the survivability of a complete thermal nuclear
[01:07.320 --> 01:15.600]  war on the face of this earth, or the legitimate use of small tactical nuclear weapons.
[01:15.600 --> 01:26.200]  Also they write about the legitimization of race specific bio weapons to wipe out certain
[01:26.200 --> 01:32.560]  groups with certain genomes, certain races of humans.
[01:32.560 --> 01:34.280]  This is the world we live in.
[01:34.280 --> 01:37.960]  And then you've got the Russians with 10,000 nuclear weapons, you've got them in Syria
[01:37.960 --> 01:46.000]  for six years, you've got them there for decades with their only Mediterranean port, the TARDIS,
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.080]  and you've got Obama and Hillary starting the year of spring six and a half years ago
[01:51.080 --> 01:57.200]  trying to topple that nation, toppling our ally Egypt, toppling Libya, putting in people
[01:57.200 --> 02:03.520]  even worse, engaging in mass exterminations of men, women and children, Hillary bragging
[02:03.520 --> 02:07.440]  about how she came, she saw he died in between bragging about how she'd been in combat in
[02:07.440 --> 02:15.760]  the, you know, airfields in Eastern Europe, Brian Williams type behavior.
[02:15.760 --> 02:22.200]  They are now trying to strike Syria and reportedly they have 70 targets.
[02:22.200 --> 02:27.640]  They want Trump to hit 20 plus our Russian targets.
[02:27.640 --> 02:32.440]  Now the Russians have already pulled out most of their forces because they have declared
[02:32.440 --> 02:37.360]  victory over the Western back to al-Qaeda, Wahhabi, a slash ISIS groups, al-Nusra and
[02:37.360 --> 02:38.360]  others.
[02:38.360 --> 02:43.840]  And so the fact that this chemical attack came a few days after Trump called for us
[02:43.840 --> 02:50.040]  to pull out, the last three chemical attacks were found by the Pentagon, by the UN, by
[02:50.040 --> 02:56.520]  everybody to be the jihadis trying to blame it on Assad and that Assad, only hope of being
[02:56.520 --> 03:00.240]  defeated by the jihadis is to stage a chemical attack.
[03:00.240 --> 03:03.880]  So you have the history of the jihadis doing it, you have the motive, you have the background
[03:03.880 --> 03:09.120]  and now you have the Russian ambassador to the UN giving a speech yesterday at the UN
[03:09.120 --> 03:14.040]  in the morning that got no coverage in the U.S. but in full wars.
[03:14.040 --> 03:18.200]  And then again he went on national European television and talked about as well those
[03:18.200 --> 03:23.160]  clips are coming up in the next segment and said we have evidence that U.S. back rebels,
[03:23.160 --> 03:28.800]  that doesn't mean Trump entirely, it's all these factions, are training them to carry
[03:28.800 --> 03:29.800]  out chemical attacks.
[03:29.800 --> 03:33.640]  Well the Russians didn't just say this yesterday, they said this a month ago, the stories on
[03:33.640 --> 03:40.240]  infowars.com, video, Russia accuses U.S. of training jihadists to stage chemical attacks
[03:40.240 --> 03:42.800]  in Syria.
[03:42.800 --> 03:47.640]  So this broke yesterday at the UN, you'd think you'd find it on the news.
[03:47.640 --> 03:53.840]  I looked, it's nowhere but zero hedge and infowars.com and newswars.com.
[03:53.840 --> 03:58.380]  Now Rand Paul, Senator Rand Paul, Senator Cruz and others, back when our military, this
[03:58.380 --> 04:04.360]  broadcast is the tip of the spear, our audience is the real power, after Benghazi found out
[04:04.360 --> 04:08.480]  from Colonel Shaffer and others here on air that it was a resupply mission to the jihadists
[04:08.480 --> 04:11.720]  to take over Syria that Hillary and Obama were behind it.
[04:11.720 --> 04:15.680]  And so our military by the thousands held up signs over their faces and said online,
[04:15.680 --> 04:21.480]  I will not be Al Qaeda and ISIS's air force.
[04:21.480 --> 04:26.360]  That forced our military, the brass to the right thing and tell Obama we're not gonna
[04:26.360 --> 04:27.360]  back this.
[04:27.360 --> 04:30.560]  They made a deal with the Russians to come in, knock them out.
[04:30.560 --> 04:33.840]  It took five years to do it and a lot of lives.
[04:33.840 --> 04:39.480]  And now again, the globalists hope we've forgotten they're trying to kickstart this whole thing
[04:39.480 --> 04:40.480]  yet again.
[04:40.480 --> 04:44.040]  And so that's why this is so important because there's a very good chance this will trigger
[04:44.040 --> 04:48.920]  a wider regional war, maybe a new world war, perhaps a nuclear war.
[04:48.920 --> 04:53.720]  You don't want to play Russian roulette with a situation like that and we have a chance
[04:53.720 --> 04:57.640]  to get this information out and turn this around, but we've got to get really active.
[04:57.640 --> 05:00.840]  Stay with us.
[05:00.840 --> 05:01.840]  I'm so excited.
[05:01.840 --> 05:07.400]  The new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle, two months servings filled to the
[05:07.400 --> 05:11.960]  brim filled with the absolute top, the real red pill.
[05:11.960 --> 05:17.440]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[05:17.440 --> 05:20.400]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[05:20.400 --> 05:26.760]  Now, frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but
[05:26.760 --> 05:33.360]  it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae and I came
[05:33.360 --> 05:38.320]  up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers non GMO made right
[05:38.320 --> 05:44.760]  here in America, 120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which
[05:44.760 --> 05:49.520]  is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones
[05:49.520 --> 05:50.880]  in your glands.
[05:50.880 --> 05:53.680]  It is amazing.
[05:53.680 --> 06:23.440]  Good pill now available at m4warsstore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[06:23.440 --> 06:27.280]  Well President Trump, who I really admire and who I think overall is a great man who
[06:27.280 --> 06:31.600]  wants to restore this country to its former greatness and who wants to deescalate conflicts
[06:31.600 --> 06:36.160]  around the world and let the United States dominate the planet via economic prowess as
[06:36.160 --> 06:37.160]  it once did.
[06:37.160 --> 06:38.160]  I think he's a great man.
[06:38.160 --> 06:42.040]  And I went yesterday morning and stood in front of the White House and directly addressed
[06:42.040 --> 06:47.520]  the president and I said, your tweets, putting down Russia, blaming them for the attack in
[06:47.520 --> 06:53.560]  Syria with no evidence are outrageous and are incredibly dangerous.
[06:53.560 --> 06:58.880]  And I said, I know in a Machiavellian way, you may be trying to dent the neocons and
[06:58.880 --> 07:02.760]  the media claiming you're a Russian operative and we're wanting you to go to war.
[07:02.760 --> 07:12.040]  So instead of war, kind of like WWE, world wrestling, you are just putting out some rhetoric,
[07:12.040 --> 07:14.400]  but Russia didn't take it like that.
[07:14.400 --> 07:19.440]  I understand that North Korea was already making outrageous threats, so you made some
[07:19.440 --> 07:21.400]  threats back and that brought them to the table.
[07:21.400 --> 07:26.840]  You were proven right again and I backed you on that from the beginning.
[07:26.840 --> 07:37.560]  Now this latest event where you want to strike 70 targets inside Syria, where Syria and Russia
[07:37.560 --> 07:47.000]  have just defeated ISIS after a bitter six-year war is wrong, and I said that.
[07:47.000 --> 07:56.080]  The good news is, Trump has now come out and said that he never said when he was going
[07:56.080 --> 07:57.080]  to strike Syria.
[07:57.080 --> 08:02.120]  In fact, there's a tweet, never said when an attack on Syria would take place, could
[08:02.120 --> 08:08.520]  it be very soon, not at all, or not at all, in any event, the United States under my administration
[08:08.520 --> 08:13.840]  has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS.
[08:13.840 --> 08:17.920]  Where is our thank you, America?
[08:17.920 --> 08:18.920]  Where is Russia's thank you?
[08:18.920 --> 08:22.480]  Because they did about 90% of it according to our own military.
[08:22.480 --> 08:23.480]  That's just a fact.
[08:23.480 --> 08:26.200]  I'm not a ruseful file, I'm just stating the facts.
[08:26.200 --> 08:37.960]  So now, Mattis, the Secretary of Defense, has come out, the former Marine Corps General,
[08:37.960 --> 08:44.320]  and said that we have no evidence that Russia did this and that we should cool the saber-rattling
[08:44.320 --> 08:48.640]  rhetoric coming out of John McCain, coming out of the neocons, and coming out of John
[08:48.640 --> 08:56.360]  Bolton, who Trump just put in as his new National Security Advisor two weeks ago, and now we
[08:56.360 --> 09:04.200]  have this false flag that has John McCain's little dirty paws written all over it, that
[09:04.200 --> 09:07.080]  they're still assessing it.
[09:07.080 --> 09:11.680]  I talked to some CIA folks yesterday and they said, believe me, it's all being assessed.
[09:11.680 --> 09:21.080]  No one is buying it, no one is believing it, why would Assad attack some of his own civilians
[09:21.080 --> 09:25.280]  and then right when he's winning and then have the pretext to be bombed and taken out?
[09:25.280 --> 09:29.400]  Why right when the Russians are pulling out and right when the U.S. is announcing a pullout
[09:29.400 --> 09:30.400]  would this happen?
[09:30.400 --> 09:31.400]  This is so clear.
[09:31.400 --> 09:39.000]  Then I ran into some more, not high-level CIA folks, but some more CIA operatives at
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.560]  the airport and they were basically saying the same thing.
[09:43.560 --> 09:51.440]  So I talked to a bunch of CIA people in D.C. yesterday, in person, over the telephone,
[09:51.440 --> 09:59.760]  and at the airport, and we've got a CIA airport inside the airport over there, and none of
[09:59.760 --> 10:06.520]  them, none of them are buying any of it, and several of them didn't even know who I was,
[10:06.520 --> 10:10.560]  but I was with another guy, and so they were all talking to him and we were sitting around
[10:10.560 --> 10:13.760]  waiting for the plane, before the other guys got on a little taxi bus and went out to their
[10:13.760 --> 10:21.000]  plane, and that was basically the feel I got from six different people I talked to.
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.520]  They just all happened to be from the CIA, so that's what was going on yesterday.
[10:25.520 --> 10:32.000]  But Zero Hedge really gets it, and whoever Tyler Durgan is, is about as smart as it gets.
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.760]  Matt Drudge is Tyler Durgan, not from the movie, but the gnome de plume from Zero Hedge,
[10:36.760 --> 10:39.160]  and I'm not going to toot my own horn, but our guests are excellent.
[10:39.160 --> 10:43.480]  We've got Nigel Farage, obviously, who's out exposing this war, saying it's a bad idea
[10:43.480 --> 10:47.560]  that Theresa May is crazy, and he's going to be joining us coming up the next hour.
[10:47.560 --> 10:52.120]  We also have a former high-level advisor from the Kremlin joining us to talk about what
[10:52.120 --> 10:55.880]  this war could look like if the U.S. does attack, how it could quickly, in just a matter
[10:55.880 --> 11:01.120]  of hours or days, get out of hand, and the media will then say that I'm a Russian operative
[11:01.120 --> 11:02.400]  for having a Russian on.
[11:02.400 --> 11:06.840]  No, when I have Nigel Farage on, I don't work for the British government.
[11:06.840 --> 11:08.920]  When I talk to a Russian, I don't work for the Russians.
[11:08.920 --> 11:19.080]  When I talk to six different CIA operatives and some bosses over their operations, they
[11:19.080 --> 11:20.520]  all basically say the same thing.
[11:20.520 --> 11:26.480]  So that's what we do, is we sample a large sampling of people, and then I have my own
[11:26.480 --> 11:27.480]  historical research.
[11:27.480 --> 11:32.600]  Here's the article I've had it posted up at infowars.com, six simple reasons why Trump
[11:32.600 --> 11:34.800]  is going to war in Syria.
[11:34.800 --> 11:40.160]  We're going to cover this when we come back, the Petro dollar, John McCain, the deep state
[11:40.160 --> 11:41.160]  president.
[11:41.160 --> 11:44.880]  That's what he is, president of the deep state, calling president of the Democratic Party,
[11:44.880 --> 11:48.200]  president of the deep state, president of the coup government.
[11:48.200 --> 11:50.880]  Number three, Saudi Arabia and the MBS.
[11:50.880 --> 11:52.720]  Number four, Israel wants it.
[11:52.720 --> 11:56.720]  Number five, cover up, pass and present American deep state false flags in Syria.
[11:56.720 --> 12:04.280]  Number six, distract from Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, and that's just some of them.
[12:04.280 --> 12:11.160]  So excellent, excellent points in all of those, and again, I talk to Russians, don't work
[12:11.160 --> 12:12.160]  for them.
[12:12.160 --> 12:13.760]  I talk to the CIA, don't work for them.
[12:13.760 --> 12:16.960]  When I talk to the British, don't work for them.
[12:16.960 --> 12:20.400]  I am an American, I work for the truth.
[12:20.400 --> 12:23.740]  All right, let's get back into these clips.
[12:23.740 --> 12:27.640]  This is the best sign yet, and it shows you the fight going on.
[12:27.640 --> 12:31.880]  Remember last year, when McMaster said we're going to go all the way to Damascus and take
[12:31.880 --> 12:37.280]  out Assad too, once the Russians had taken out ISIS, well that isn't the agreement the
[12:37.280 --> 12:40.680]  Pentagon had five years ago with the Russians.
[12:40.680 --> 12:45.280]  In counter-valence of Obama's treason, that was a big American wake-up call and we found
[12:45.280 --> 12:46.280]  our soul again.
[12:46.280 --> 12:50.040]  Well, we're finding it again this time if we get the word out, but now Trump coming
[12:50.040 --> 12:53.200]  out saying, okay, we'll blast him, we'll get him.
[12:53.200 --> 12:55.560]  Do Russians say you're going to shoot down our missiles when they're coming to blow
[12:55.560 --> 12:56.560]  up your troops?
[12:56.560 --> 12:59.680]  Well, we'll really take it to you.
[12:59.680 --> 13:00.680]  That's crazy.
[13:00.680 --> 13:03.080]  I don't know what Trump was doing, but we'll see.
[13:03.080 --> 13:04.960]  We hear about this four-and-five-D chess.
[13:04.960 --> 13:07.840]  We'll see, but I don't want to play around with Russia and nuclear weapons.
[13:07.840 --> 13:12.880]  It might work with Kim Jong-un because none of his really worked very well yet, but you've
[13:12.880 --> 13:19.760]  got Mattis coming out, Secretary of Defense, well, here, let's just hear from him what
[13:19.760 --> 13:20.760]  he has to say.
[13:20.760 --> 13:24.920]  Secretary, have you seen enough evidence that to blend this hot regime for this most recent
[13:24.920 --> 13:25.920]  chemical attack?
[13:25.920 --> 13:28.520]  Have you seen evidence confident to make that assumption?
[13:28.520 --> 13:34.200]  We're still assessing the intelligence ourselves and our allies, but we're still working on
[13:34.200 --> 13:35.200]  this.
[13:35.200 --> 13:40.360]  Is the U.S. military ready right now to conduct a retaliatory strike if ordered?
[13:40.360 --> 13:45.760]  We stand ready to provide military options if they're appropriate, as the President determined.
[13:45.760 --> 13:46.760]  But thank you very much.
[13:46.760 --> 13:54.600]  Thank you very much.
[13:54.600 --> 13:55.600]  So there you go.
[13:55.600 --> 14:02.040]  Now, hopefully, that shows that sanity is prevailing and that the big kids are in charge
[14:02.040 --> 14:08.160]  because there's a very good chance that when the Russians strike back against our ships
[14:08.160 --> 14:12.560]  and we see sinking destroyers, that then we're going to hit bigger Russian targets and then
[14:12.560 --> 14:19.320]  it's off the races because the Russian military position is just like ours.
[14:19.320 --> 14:23.400]  If they're hit first and they're overwhelmed, you go to tactical nuclear weapons.
[14:23.400 --> 14:29.120]  So we're talking minutes, hours, days, boom, this could happen.
[14:29.120 --> 14:35.200]  You go to sleep, you wake up and ICBMs are popping open, coming back into the atmosphere
[14:35.200 --> 14:37.920]  and releasing their MIRV payloads.
[14:37.920 --> 14:42.680]  That means a whole bunch of warheads hitting different targets.
[14:42.680 --> 14:48.080]  Now a lot of media is pointing out that the Russians have pulled out of their main port
[14:48.080 --> 14:51.720]  at TARDIS, but they've already pulled out.
[14:51.720 --> 14:55.240]  The Russians have already pulled out 90% of their forces.
[14:55.240 --> 14:56.800]  They already left.
[14:56.800 --> 14:57.840]  They're already gone.
[14:57.840 --> 15:02.000]  They're trying to leave and there's still some military bases and some air bases that
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.720]  are evacuating out Russians because it's mission accomplished.
[15:05.720 --> 15:10.120]  But for real this time, not like Bush out on the aircraft carrier, we're in his codpiece.
[15:10.120 --> 15:11.960]  And so they're trying to stop that.
[15:11.960 --> 15:15.600]  They don't want peace to break out.

[19:12.160 --> 19:13.160]  amazing.
[19:13.160 --> 19:18.600]  Devin was on the fence and by it because I've got caveman, superman of vitality, secret
[19:18.600 --> 19:22.160]  swell, vitamin and infusion, I've got the body armor.
[19:22.160 --> 19:23.160]  Wow, thank you.

[19:31.880 --> 19:36.440]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt sweet.
[19:36.440 --> 19:42.600]  My morning was fantastic and I love the guys, I love the infowars through and I just want
[19:42.600 --> 19:47.120]  to say yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence
[19:47.120 --> 19:51.560]  just buy it, you will love it, I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[19:51.560 --> 19:55.960]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[19:55.960 --> 20:03.960]  It's a win-win at infowarslife.com.
[20:03.960 --> 20:22.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:22.800 --> 20:30.440]  You found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show.
[20:30.440 --> 20:39.040]  So, most main mainline analysts agree the United States and Russia are in a protracted
[20:39.040 --> 20:44.640]  long-term strategic war that the West has started since the fall of the Soviet Union
[20:44.640 --> 20:50.240]  to take over the former satellites and George Soros has been captaining those operations
[20:50.240 --> 20:51.880]  including inside Russia.
[20:51.880 --> 20:55.880]  They overthrew Ukraine and elected government four years ago.
[20:55.880 --> 21:00.520]  The same globalists are trying to overthrow our system here and bring in a tyranny.
[21:00.520 --> 21:03.920]  And so Russia faces really the same enemies as the United States.
[21:03.920 --> 21:08.600]  When John McCain claims he's this big patriot, he wants your guns, he wants open borders,
[21:08.600 --> 21:09.600]  he's a globalist.
[21:09.600 --> 21:13.200]  He wants to make sure that we don't have our own energy supply.
[21:13.200 --> 21:18.200]  He wants to use American power for global domination for a select group of corporations
[21:18.200 --> 21:20.840]  that are anti-American, anti-God.
[21:20.840 --> 21:22.960]  But regardless, we started the war.
[21:22.960 --> 21:26.560]  That is the globalist in control of our country, not the American people, against Syria.
[21:26.560 --> 21:29.920]  They started the Arab Spring.
[21:29.920 --> 21:34.080]  And they're mad that the Russians and our own military were successful defeating ISIS.
[21:34.080 --> 21:38.240]  So they've rebranded al-Qaeda into ISIS, now they've rebranded it into a new group and
[21:38.240 --> 21:46.760]  the Russians have come out, their ambassador, Vasili Nabindia, and have said that they have
[21:46.760 --> 21:51.520]  evidence and that they tracked U.S. forces there training the rebels to stage provocations
[21:51.520 --> 21:53.040]  including chemical attacks.
[21:53.040 --> 21:55.440]  And they warned of this two months ago.
[21:55.440 --> 22:00.720]  Then days after Trump says, we're going to pull our troops out of Syria, mission accomplished,
[22:00.720 --> 22:05.480]  the Russians were shocked saying, well, you're going to keep your agreement, boom, the chemical
[22:05.480 --> 22:06.480]  attack happens.
[22:06.480 --> 22:10.680]  Now they've got the British ambassador to Syria, he's saying it's staged by the rebels
[22:10.680 --> 22:14.760]  and that they're jerking our chain every time they do this, we can be called back in, it's
[22:14.760 --> 22:15.760]  very dangerous.
[22:15.760 --> 22:17.480]  Well, the Russians say they have the evidence.
[22:17.480 --> 22:24.800]  So here is some of the video from the UN yesterday, but where is this in our news?
[22:24.800 --> 22:28.240]  You know, the UN found three years ago that the rebels had been caught staging the chemical
[22:28.240 --> 22:29.240]  attack.
[22:29.240 --> 22:33.600]  They tested it and it was Saudi Arabian in origin.
[22:33.600 --> 22:39.760]  When Ron Paul came on my show and talked about it, they used that in an internal Google document
[22:39.760 --> 22:45.600]  to announce they were hiring an outside company to go out and delist info wars off of Google.
[22:45.600 --> 22:52.040]  Chang, we were fake news that Ron Paul and the UN were wrong.
[22:52.040 --> 22:53.040]  See how that works?
[22:53.040 --> 22:55.280]  And that's why they're filing a lawsuit against us a week.
[22:55.280 --> 22:56.720]  They're totally frivolous.
[22:56.720 --> 22:57.920]  We're kicking them out.
[22:57.920 --> 23:00.040]  We got another one dismissed last week.
[23:00.040 --> 23:03.920]  Still cost me about 10 grand to get it dismissed in lawyers' face.
[23:03.920 --> 23:06.320]  Just got another notice this morning, I'll be telling you about next week.
[23:06.320 --> 23:08.160]  I'm going to tell you about the suit before it gets filed.
[23:08.160 --> 23:12.280]  It's incredibly fraudulent and it's going to be big news, but they're coming after us
[23:12.280 --> 23:17.120]  because we have a memory and we'll show you stuff they don't want you to see like the
[23:17.120 --> 23:18.120]  Russian ambassador.
[23:18.120 --> 23:19.120]  Here it is.
[23:19.120 --> 23:21.120]  I did.
[23:21.120 --> 23:28.100]  Also information is surfacing that at times the camp, American instructors trained a number
[23:28.100 --> 23:33.600]  of groups of fighters to stage provocations with chemical weapons used to create a pretext
[23:33.600 --> 23:37.640]  for a strike.
[23:37.640 --> 23:46.080]  It was clear to us that the attempt to shelter terrorists and at the same time to punish
[23:46.080 --> 23:52.760]  the regime so hated by some Western capitals will sooner or later be undertaken.
[23:52.760 --> 24:04.560]  Speaking heads on television screens sought to repeat last year's attack against Syria.
[24:04.560 --> 24:09.000]  Last year's strike this morning there were strikes, missile strikes against the Tifrar
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.840]  airfield in Homs province.
[24:11.840 --> 24:16.320]  We are deeply troubled by such actions.
[24:16.320 --> 24:21.720]  Provocations in Dunguma echo last year's incident in Hanchihun.
[24:21.720 --> 24:26.960]  The unifying moment aspect is the fact that there's a planned nature of these attacks
[24:26.960 --> 24:31.480]  and analysis of the U.S. operations prior to and after the incident in Hanchihun in
[24:31.480 --> 24:38.960]  April 2007 shows that Washington ahead of time prepared for its operation.
[24:38.960 --> 24:50.040]  The U.S. Porter and Ross Naval destroyers from 4 to 7 April last year, that is when the toxic
[24:50.040 --> 24:55.480]  substance was used in Hanchihun before the strike against the Shirat airbase were already
[24:55.480 --> 25:01.720]  present in the Mediterranean waters where they were engaged in planned operations.
[25:01.720 --> 25:07.680]  They did not enter the ports where an exchange of munitions could have been taken place by
[25:07.680 --> 25:11.560]  increasing the number of cruise missiles.
[25:11.560 --> 25:16.080]  That is Vasily Nabenzia, the main Russian ambassador to the United Nations.
[25:16.080 --> 25:19.560]  Now you'd think that that'd be big news and it goes on for 20 more minutes.
[25:19.560 --> 25:20.680]  It's all bombshell.
[25:20.680 --> 25:22.720]  The full video is on infowars.com.
[25:22.720 --> 25:28.640]  Russia accuses U.S. of training jihadists to stage chemical attacks in Syria.
[25:28.640 --> 25:30.520]  It's incredible.
[25:30.520 --> 25:35.400]  Nowhere in U.S. news, not even in the Liberty Base news except for Zero Hedge.
[25:35.400 --> 25:38.280]  And I'm not bashing anybody, but this is so unknown.
[25:38.280 --> 25:43.920]  I came in this morning and the morning crew who were awesome folks didn't even know because
[25:43.920 --> 25:48.920]  our news had scrolled off from last night, there was so much new news.
[25:48.920 --> 26:00.080]  I just so happened to be scrolling through news alerts and happened to see it yesterday
[26:00.080 --> 26:04.800]  and then read the transcript as the plane was about to take off in D.C. and I called
[26:04.800 --> 26:05.800]  the crew.
[26:05.800 --> 26:06.800]  And I'm not saying, oh, look, I'm so smart.
[26:06.800 --> 26:07.800]  I caught it.
[26:07.800 --> 26:08.800]  I found it.
[26:08.800 --> 26:09.800]  This is nowhere.
[26:09.800 --> 26:10.800]  How huge is this?
[26:10.800 --> 26:11.800]  Here's the headline.
[26:11.800 --> 26:17.480]  Russia denies doing the chemical attack, says deep state forces staged it with the rebels.
[26:17.480 --> 26:20.960]  And that's where the evidence points, it's where the motive points, the same people
[26:20.960 --> 26:24.480]  have been caught doing it before.
[26:24.480 --> 26:29.640]  So I align myself with the truth and the globalists are trying to overturn sovereign nations.
[26:29.640 --> 26:36.480]  I'm all about Victor Orban, just winning in Hungary by a huge landslide reelection despite
[26:36.480 --> 26:40.880]  Soros reportedly putting $50 million in against him.
[26:40.880 --> 26:46.520]  He's like Ron Paul, super libertarian, wants a second amendment for their people, totally
[26:46.520 --> 26:52.040]  Christian, totally family, radical, Islam is the enemy, Brazil's got a guy about to
[26:52.040 --> 26:55.920]  be elected, he's way ahead in the polls, wants the same thing.
[26:55.920 --> 27:03.200]  Most of the movements are like Ron Paul, Info Wars, Donald Trump-esque.
[27:03.200 --> 27:04.200]  And that's what's exciting.
[27:04.200 --> 27:07.480]  And the globalists are trying to crush that and Russia's going in that direction.
[27:07.480 --> 27:10.440]  Why wouldn't we want Russia to go in that direction?
[27:10.440 --> 27:14.480]  Well, the same globalists that hate this country and hate our freedoms, they have been stealing
[27:14.480 --> 27:18.560]  our energy, stealing our name, stealing our treasure, stealing our blood with our troops
[27:18.560 --> 27:24.560]  that die, our taxpayers breaking our backs to pay for this global empire that's against
[27:24.560 --> 27:27.040]  us too.
[27:27.040 --> 27:31.320]  I'm all about 1776 worldwide, I'm all about us being the best, having the biggest military,
[27:31.320 --> 27:35.200]  the strongest, the best industry, the best science, you get in our way, you try to push
[27:35.200 --> 27:37.400]  us around, we smash you.
[27:37.400 --> 27:40.960]  But I'm not about having globalists that hate me more than they hate the Russians running
[27:40.960 --> 27:45.640]  my country and using me to go after them and then threaten the whole world with nuclear
[27:45.640 --> 27:46.640]  war.
[27:46.640 --> 27:47.640]  No, sir!
[27:47.640 --> 27:52.080]  Now, that said, we are listed, funded, and we're under globalist attack, as you know,
[27:52.080 --> 27:55.200]  and I want to keep expanding, not just at the same size in the brunt of this.
[27:55.200 --> 27:58.440]  We need you to go buy product.
[27:58.440 --> 28:00.880]  And it's only happened one other time in its five-year history.
[28:00.880 --> 28:03.840]  We're having some trouble, I'm told, by the manufacturer getting the deep earth crystals
[28:03.840 --> 28:10.440]  for this purist of iodine out there, survival shield X-tube, and it looks like he'll probably
[28:10.440 --> 28:13.400]  be able to get more, but we're not going to have any for a few months, and it really is
[28:13.400 --> 28:15.800]  going to sell out at this current rate in about a week.
[28:15.800 --> 28:19.200]  So I'm going to have to cut the 25% off in the next few days.
[28:19.200 --> 28:24.360]  Survival Shield X-tube, the amazing good halogen, infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com,

[29:37.880 --> 29:38.880]  help you too.
[29:38.880 --> 29:42.800]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[29:42.800 --> 29:43.800]  case.
[29:43.800 --> 29:47.560]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[30:00.200 --> 30:05.920]  I want to plow into all of this, that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just

[30:25.080 --> 30:26.080]  at infowarstore.com.

[30:56.240 --> 31:17.840]  against us so we need your support.
[31:17.840 --> 31:45.160]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[31:45.160 --> 32:11.160]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[32:11.160 --> 32:41.000]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[32:41.160 --> 33:06.000]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[33:11.160 --> 33:23.160]  You thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer
[33:23.160 --> 33:26.240]  to the violence of the sun.
[33:26.240 --> 33:33.440]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[33:33.440 --> 33:34.440]  show.
[33:34.440 --> 33:41.520]  Andrei Afanasyev has been on with us before, and I appreciate him coming on today.
[33:41.520 --> 33:46.960]  He was on with Owen Shroyer during the info wars transmission, and didn't have time to
[33:46.960 --> 33:52.920]  get to his entire breakdown of the different nightmare scenarios that could take place.
[33:52.920 --> 33:57.840]  If President Trump follows through with striking 70 different targets, including more than
[33:57.840 --> 34:03.440]  20 that have Russian troops or sailors staying there, incredible.
[34:03.440 --> 34:07.320]  We've got six reasons why Trump could strike Syria.
[34:07.320 --> 34:11.080]  In fact, Tyler Durgan predicts he will.
[34:11.080 --> 34:15.400]  The Petro dollar, John McCain, the shadow government president, and that's who he is.
[34:15.400 --> 34:17.480]  He's the globalist hardliner.
[34:17.480 --> 34:18.800]  Saudi Arabia wants it.
[34:18.800 --> 34:20.960]  Israel wants it.
[34:20.960 --> 34:22.520]  Cover up past and present.
[34:22.520 --> 34:23.960]  Deep state false flags.
[34:23.960 --> 34:28.600]  A distract from Michael Cohen and the Stormy Daniels situation.
[34:28.600 --> 34:32.040]  Trump's original instincts were right on this.
[34:32.040 --> 34:38.320]  Andrei Afanasyev is a former advisor to the Kremlin.
[34:38.320 --> 34:42.080]  He's a journalist, TV host, and head of the political department at Russia's first independent
[34:42.080 --> 34:45.080]  pro-Christian conservative political TV channel.
[34:45.080 --> 34:49.600]  And he joins us, previously worked for RT, and currently authors and hosts a show, Russian
[34:49.600 --> 34:50.600]  Answer.
[34:50.600 --> 34:56.200]  And by the way, I love how George Soros that owns and runs Media Matters funds it and people
[34:56.200 --> 34:58.240]  from American Way and all that are funded by him.
[34:58.240 --> 35:02.120]  Every time I have a Russian on, they say, look, he's a Russian agent.
[35:02.120 --> 35:05.280]  I'm going to have a Brit on Nigel Farage later.
[35:05.280 --> 35:10.040]  And I'm going to, you know, I have Ron Paul on and I have Donald Trump on and I have Antifa
[35:10.040 --> 35:11.120]  folks on disagree with.
[35:11.120 --> 35:16.520]  But this bullying intellectually, this authoritarianism that we're bad if we hear from Russia.
[35:16.520 --> 35:20.160]  The Russian ambassador came out, we just played at the clip and said they have evidence that
[35:20.160 --> 35:23.240]  last year and this latest attack were staged by the rebels.
[35:23.240 --> 35:26.920]  Even the UN has said that the rebels bragged about it.
[35:26.920 --> 35:29.240]  And there's a blackout in our news.
[35:29.240 --> 35:30.440]  Americans want to know about this.
[35:30.440 --> 35:34.080]  Instead of having a couple of million views a day on our YouTube channel, I'm like a
[35:34.080 --> 35:36.560]  couple extra million just on that.
[35:36.560 --> 35:41.320]  People are really interested in this and they don't want World War.
[35:41.320 --> 35:44.360]  So it's all up on infowars.com right now.
[35:44.360 --> 35:48.880]  The good news is Mattis has come out and said they don't have evidence yet that Russia did
[35:48.880 --> 35:49.880]  this.
[35:49.880 --> 35:52.320]  He said that this morning.
[35:52.320 --> 35:54.520]  And he also said it yesterday, they're still assessing.
[35:54.520 --> 35:57.600]  So that shows that there's some sanity going on up there.
[35:57.600 --> 36:03.440]  Why would Trump, who I'm a big supporter of, shoot his mouth off against Russia without
[36:03.440 --> 36:04.440]  the evidence?
[36:04.440 --> 36:06.520]  Well, it's because they're putting heat on him, folks.
[36:06.520 --> 36:08.320]  They didn't find any Russia evidence.
[36:08.320 --> 36:11.720]  I can tell you that from the highest levels, but they are going to find something on his
[36:11.720 --> 36:12.720]  lawyers.
[36:12.720 --> 36:13.840]  They're going to find something in business.
[36:13.840 --> 36:14.840]  Nobody's perfect.
[36:14.840 --> 36:18.880]  They're going to find some mistake in bookkeeping and they're going to throw wire fraud charges
[36:18.880 --> 36:22.200]  against everybody in his family and that's now happening.
[36:22.200 --> 36:26.320]  So just like Rand Paul and others have said, the swamp is striking back.
[36:26.320 --> 36:27.440]  Alan Dershowitz has said it.
[36:27.440 --> 36:33.360]  This is dangerous to have this rogue FBI group run by the Clintons, running around, witch-hunting
[36:33.360 --> 36:37.360]  the president and everybody and bullying the president into war with Russia.
[36:37.360 --> 36:39.400]  This is insane.
[36:39.400 --> 36:45.880]  The sanctions, the strikes, the bravado is way above anything in the Cold War as they
[36:45.880 --> 36:49.400]  successfully bully the president and trying to show he's not a Russian agent.
[36:49.400 --> 36:51.280]  How about he just nukes the whole planet?
[36:51.280 --> 36:52.480]  How about that, President Trump?
[36:52.480 --> 36:56.560]  Just kill everybody and then we'll have a dead planet to prove that you're not a Russian
[36:56.560 --> 37:01.560]  agent when Hillary got all this Russian money and Chinese money and tarmacs.
[37:01.560 --> 37:06.400]  Given the Russians' uranium on tarmacs, it's unbelievable how the Clintons, see, I have
[37:06.400 --> 37:07.400]  my guest on.
[37:07.400 --> 37:10.880]  Well, in this segment, the next, in the little five minutes, because Nigel Farage is joining
[37:10.880 --> 37:11.880]  us.
[37:11.880 --> 37:12.880]  He'll get the five back.
[37:12.880 --> 37:15.280]  He just lost with me ranting in the first five of the next hour.
[37:15.280 --> 37:18.720]  So Andre, thank you for coming on with us.
[37:18.720 --> 37:20.200]  There's so much to cover.
[37:20.200 --> 37:21.920]  Let's just get right to it.
[37:21.920 --> 37:23.360]  How dangerous this is.
[37:23.360 --> 37:27.200]  What the different scenarios are of how this could unravel very, very quickly if a bunch
[37:27.200 --> 37:31.960]  of Russians get killed for liberating Syria from ISIS, something President Trump is taking
[37:31.960 --> 37:32.960]  credit for.
[37:32.960 --> 37:33.960]  Hello, Alex.
[37:33.960 --> 37:39.160]  I'm happy to be with you and with the audience today.
[37:39.160 --> 37:44.720]  So there are, as I have already mentioned with Oven Shrower the day before, there are
[37:44.720 --> 37:50.520]  several scenarios and several possible outcomes of the current situation we are in now.
[37:50.520 --> 37:53.880]  So the easiest way is that nothing happens.
[37:53.880 --> 37:59.640]  Trump just brings in the flip to the Syrian coast, says, well, I'm great.
[37:59.640 --> 38:00.640]  America is great.
[38:00.640 --> 38:01.640]  Everything is fine.
[38:01.640 --> 38:02.640]  Russians are back.
[38:02.640 --> 38:03.640]  Syrians are back.
[38:03.640 --> 38:04.640]  Iranians are scared.
[38:04.640 --> 38:05.640]  That's it.
[38:05.640 --> 38:06.640]  We are great.
[38:06.640 --> 38:09.320]  Several good tweets, several good headlines.
[38:09.320 --> 38:10.560]  Everyone is happy.
[38:10.560 --> 38:14.320]  The pressure is a bit down on both sides.
[38:14.320 --> 38:17.680]  This variant is the perfect in current situation.
[38:17.680 --> 38:23.160]  It's definitely a trouble to think that it's a perfect variant for us today, but it is.
[38:23.160 --> 38:32.720]  So the next level of nightmare is if something happens like a year before when the Americans,
[38:32.720 --> 38:39.680]  when the American Navy shot several dozens of Tomahawk vessels toward Han Shihun air
[38:39.680 --> 38:40.920]  base in Syria.
[38:40.920 --> 38:44.440]  It was a secondary object of Syrian infrastructure.
[38:44.440 --> 38:47.440]  It wasn't important.
[38:47.440 --> 38:53.080]  American troops told and they warned Russian troops that they're going to do this.
[38:53.080 --> 38:57.880]  So we withdrew all our units from there as well as in the Syrian Army.
[38:57.880 --> 39:04.760]  So technically they bombed an old building and a couple of World War II-era rusty planes
[39:04.760 --> 39:09.520]  that haven't been flying for several decades.
[39:09.520 --> 39:15.240]  So that's the next step of a nightmare that's also acceptable and understandable.
[39:15.240 --> 39:19.600]  In this case, if Trump destroys some kind of secondary infrastructure, the pressure
[39:19.600 --> 39:20.600]  would be down.
[39:20.600 --> 39:24.680]  The globalist would be fed with this for a certain period of time.
[39:24.680 --> 39:26.040]  But they push for more.
[39:26.040 --> 39:27.040]  What is more?
[39:27.040 --> 39:32.400]  More is attacking Iran that will bring another side in this conflict.
[39:32.400 --> 39:40.480]  And definitely Iran is bigger and stronger than Syria and has more capabilities to retaliate
[39:40.480 --> 39:45.160]  towards U.S. that would provoke even a worse nightmare.
[39:45.160 --> 39:51.840]  The next step is attacking the primary infrastructure of the capital, all the official buildings
[39:51.840 --> 39:59.240]  of Syria that would harm the core of political elite of the country.
[39:59.240 --> 40:05.120]  Because Assad, with all his disadvantages, is a brave person that hasn't fled the country.
[40:05.120 --> 40:11.160]  He is there with his people in his capital, fighting with the terrorists still.
[40:11.160 --> 40:16.080]  And technically the United States can't kill him with Tomahawks because they don't have
[40:16.080 --> 40:21.040]  enough infrastructure to down all the rocks they can down partly.
[40:21.040 --> 40:24.160]  That's the next step of a real nightmare.
[40:24.160 --> 40:30.360]  Then comes the nightmare if Americans, if American troops will attack Russian conflict.
[40:30.360 --> 40:38.560]  It will mean that several members of so-called PWCs, private world companies, would be killed
[40:38.560 --> 40:42.680]  by American missiles and deliberately.
[40:42.680 --> 40:48.240]  So in this case, there would be some kind of cord retaliation instead.
[40:48.240 --> 40:54.800]  And the worst scenario, the worst possible scenario is the direct attack on Russian military
[40:54.800 --> 41:00.080]  and Russian infrastructure in Syria that I will remind is there absolutely legally, according
[41:00.080 --> 41:06.600]  to international law, invited by a sovereign government of Syria to fight ISIS and to fight
[41:06.600 --> 41:10.800]  terrorists that are attacking everyone, including the American society.
[41:10.800 --> 41:13.680]  So that would be the worst-case scenario.
[41:13.680 --> 41:20.120]  So we've gone through the easiest thing that will be just some kind of a media and I would
[41:20.120 --> 41:25.960]  call it Twitter war, to a real war between our nations.
[41:25.960 --> 41:31.040]  We in Russia definitely are not interested in a war with the U.S. We are not interested
[41:31.040 --> 41:35.440]  in a war at all with anyone, we're a peaceful nation, no matter what globalist media tell
[41:35.440 --> 41:36.440]  about us.
[41:36.440 --> 41:37.440]  We don't need anything.
[41:37.440 --> 41:38.440]  We have enough resources.
[41:38.440 --> 41:39.920]  We have enough land.
[41:39.920 --> 41:43.600]  We have anything, everything you can possibly need.
[41:43.600 --> 41:49.880]  So there is no objective mean to start a war by Russia.
[41:49.880 --> 41:54.160]  So U.S. is pushed into a war with Russia, not us.
[41:54.160 --> 41:55.880]  They cannot push us now.
[41:55.880 --> 42:02.040]  And we hope that our fellow Americans understand that it's nothing but a provocation and the
[42:02.040 --> 42:09.080]  American society, sane American politicians, sane American journalists like you Alex and
[42:09.080 --> 42:14.800]  your colleagues must do everything to prevent it and me personally as a Russian citizen,
[42:14.800 --> 42:20.880]  as an expert, as a journalist, I'm ready to do anything to prevent it, even to risk
[42:20.880 --> 42:24.480]  my life and health to do this, to help you.
[42:24.480 --> 42:29.160]  Because it's really important now, we're really in trouble, but there is still a chance to
[42:29.160 --> 42:30.160]  change it.
[42:30.160 --> 42:36.280]  The thing is that we need to establish as many informal contacts as possible among our people,
[42:36.280 --> 42:37.920]  both in U.S. and in Russia.
[42:37.920 --> 42:40.320]  This may be the most important thing now.
[42:40.320 --> 42:41.320]  All right, stay there.
[42:41.320 --> 42:46.200]  We've got an expert, a national TV host in Russia breaking this down.
[42:46.200 --> 42:50.720]  And we're going to go over more of it on the other side because this could lead to a nuclear
[42:50.720 --> 42:51.720]  war.
[42:51.720 --> 42:54.040]  Again, this is in Russia's back door.
[42:54.040 --> 42:55.160]  They were invited by Assad.
[42:55.160 --> 42:56.480]  They helped defeat ISIS.
[42:56.480 --> 42:59.560]  Now the neocons are striking back.
[42:59.560 --> 43:05.560]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by Info War's

[46:00.040 --> 46:03.080]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[46:03.080 --> 46:07.280]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[46:07.280 --> 46:11.920]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and awards shows to repeat their
[46:11.920 --> 46:14.640]  narrative over and over again.
[46:14.640 --> 46:18.440]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[46:18.440 --> 46:24.320]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia
[46:24.320 --> 46:30.160]  and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully
[46:30.160 --> 46:35.600]  and terrorize the law-abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their
[46:35.600 --> 46:38.520]  jobs and stop the madness.
[46:38.520 --> 46:42.600]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[46:42.600 --> 46:49.200]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight
[46:49.200 --> 46:53.720]  this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[46:53.720 --> 46:59.440]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[47:23.720 --> 47:36.040]  Out here in the fields, it's the regular guy fighting for my family, for your family.
[47:36.040 --> 47:39.920]  Knowing we have unlimited resources of the technology we have now, we got to work together
[47:39.920 --> 47:44.240]  in a culture based on competition and shared human values.
[47:44.240 --> 47:47.440]  The globalists are just like Hitler, they're just like Stalin, they're like all these
[47:47.440 --> 47:52.520]  power mad people, they want total control and domination and they're trying to dominate
[47:52.520 --> 47:54.160]  Russia using radical Islam.
[47:54.160 --> 47:55.160]  It's incredible.
[47:55.160 --> 48:01.680]  Andrei Afanezyev is our guest here for this segment and the next, this story just broke.
[48:01.680 --> 48:04.680]  Pompeo, director of the CIA, is testifying right now.
[48:04.680 --> 48:08.520]  I think he's done a lot of good things at the CIA, but I'll be honest with you, he's
[48:08.520 --> 48:13.520]  a nationalist, was a nationalist congressman, part of the Freedom Caucus.
[48:13.520 --> 48:18.880]  But listen to this quote, we've already killed hundreds of Russians in Syria.
[48:18.880 --> 48:25.160]  Get Daniels reports on that, so yes, they've already bombed repeatedly and blown up air
[48:25.160 --> 48:30.920]  fields and other facilities full of Russians who we invited in right along with Assad five
[48:30.920 --> 48:34.640]  years ago when our military said, yes, it's wrong to back al-Qaeda and Congress wouldn't
[48:34.640 --> 48:37.080]  fund the al-Qaeda takeover.
[48:37.080 --> 48:41.120]  So the media changed the name to ISIS, it's the same group.
[48:41.120 --> 48:45.240]  And so now you've caught the rebels chemical attacking over and over again.
[48:45.240 --> 48:49.080]  This fourth time, the Russian ambassador comes out and says, I'll play a clip in a moment,
[48:49.080 --> 48:53.960]  we also set it on Eurovision television, and there's a blackout.
[48:53.960 --> 48:58.280]  You'd think the Russian government at the UN saying, we didn't do this, this has been
[48:58.280 --> 49:01.560]  staged before, would be newsworthy.
[49:01.560 --> 49:06.800]  But last year via Mike Cernovich, we got internal Google documents on a multi-million dollar
[49:06.800 --> 49:11.800]  contract where Google was paying to have infowars delisted as fake news, but covertly having
[49:11.800 --> 49:17.600]  contractors go out and delisted outside their algorithm to keep the algorithm still operating
[49:17.600 --> 49:18.600]  correctly.
[49:18.600 --> 49:21.680]  They don't just delist me themselves, they hire others to do it so they can testify
[49:21.680 --> 49:22.680]  they've never done it.
[49:22.680 --> 49:26.920]  You can read the documents, Google said, oh, that was a mistake.
[49:26.920 --> 49:27.920]  That was an accident.
[49:27.920 --> 49:29.120]  We're not going to delist Alex Jones.
[49:29.120 --> 49:30.120]  What was the fake news?
[49:30.120 --> 49:34.520]  Their reason that the rebels ever got caught staging chemical attacks.
[49:34.520 --> 49:38.800]  That was all over the news four years ago, the first time they got caught.
[49:38.800 --> 49:43.240]  After that, the media got so controlled the other two times, now there's this fourth time,
[49:43.240 --> 49:46.920]  we believe, we don't know yet, but it looks like it.
[49:46.920 --> 49:49.800]  Why would Assad do this right as he's winning and everybody's pulling out when it's the
[49:49.800 --> 49:50.800]  red line?
[49:50.800 --> 49:55.880]  And right when Trump says he's pulling out, this is clearly the deep state.
[49:55.880 --> 49:56.880]  It's unbelievable.
[49:56.880 --> 50:01.000]  And now folks are saying assassinate Assad when he westernized, open things up.
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  His dad was a bad guy.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.880]  I'm not saying he's a good guy, but it's his country.
[50:04.880 --> 50:07.600]  The Middle East is full of dictators.
[50:07.600 --> 50:11.640]  The Pompeo, we're already killed hundreds of Russians in Syria.
[50:11.640 --> 50:15.840]  Let's play the clip of the Russian ambassador and we'll go back to our guest.
[50:15.840 --> 50:20.040]  Not at the UN, but we have the Russian ambassador on television.
[50:20.040 --> 50:23.120]  Again, this is in Europe talking about it.
[50:23.120 --> 50:27.440]  And then we also have a former UK ambassador, Peter Ford, taking the evidence points towards
[50:27.440 --> 50:28.440]  it being staged.
[50:28.440 --> 50:33.360]  But first, here is the Russian ambassador to the EU claims there was no chemical attack
[50:33.360 --> 50:34.360]  in Doma.
[50:34.360 --> 50:35.360]  Here it is.
[50:35.360 --> 50:48.240]  Russia, let me correct you, is also shocked by yet another provocation with this so-called
[50:48.240 --> 50:55.680]  chemical attack in Doma, eastern Ghouta, near Damascus.
[50:55.680 --> 51:00.560]  Russian military specialists have visited the region, walked on those streets, entered
[51:00.560 --> 51:06.840]  those houses, talked to local doctors, and visited the only functioning hospital in Doma,
[51:06.840 --> 51:11.560]  including its basement, where reportedly the mountains of corpses pile up.
[51:11.560 --> 51:15.640]  There wasn't a single corpse and not a single person who came in for treatment after the
[51:15.640 --> 51:29.880]  attack, but we've seen them on the video.
[51:29.880 --> 51:37.960]  There was no chemical attack in Doma, pure and simple, and what did we see?
[51:37.960 --> 51:41.960]  We've seen another staged event, there are personnel specifically trained, and you can
[51:41.960 --> 51:47.640]  guess by who, amongst the so-called white helmets, who were already caught in the act with stage
[51:47.640 --> 51:48.640]  videos.
[51:48.640 --> 51:55.240]  Nevertheless, we're heading towards a powerful US strike against Syrian targets in response
[51:55.240 --> 52:01.320]  to such an atrocity.
[52:01.320 --> 52:05.960]  In response to something that didn't happen, still, is Russia prepared for an event like
[52:05.960 --> 52:13.480]  a strike that could eventually lead to Russians being hurt or even killed?
[52:13.480 --> 52:18.320]  Russia has warned US representatives, publicly as well as through the proper channels, over
[52:18.320 --> 52:22.720]  the grave consequences that could arise if these strikes happen, and where they're deliberately
[52:22.720 --> 52:35.520]  or otherwise, Russian citizens are hurt.
[52:35.520 --> 52:39.280]  That's Euro news, the full interview is up on infowords.com, that's the Russian ambassador
[52:39.280 --> 52:43.800]  to the EU, I just played the Russian ambassador to the UN earlier saying basically the exact
[52:43.800 --> 52:47.920]  same thing, but I don't just go off with the Russians, say I'm not a lucifile, I'm not
[52:47.920 --> 52:55.040]  an anglophile, I'm an Americana guy, but I see Russia going in the direction of 1776,
[52:55.040 --> 52:58.560]  I see us going in the opposite direction, I see the very enemies of our country trying
[52:58.560 --> 53:02.360]  to start a war by killing a bunch of Russians, and the Russians say they're going to shoot
[53:02.360 --> 53:04.880]  back at our ships.
[53:04.880 --> 53:11.480]  So let's talk with Andrey Afanezyev about a national TV host analyst, runs his own TV
[53:11.480 --> 53:17.040]  network in Russia, again, famous reporter over there, advises a lot of folks, in the
[53:17.040 --> 53:20.760]  five minutes we have in this segment, the bad scenario, we don't want to be alarmist,
[53:20.760 --> 53:26.640]  but if we're not, and talk about where this leads nuclear war, if the Russians, a bunch
[53:26.640 --> 53:30.720]  of them get killed, then under international law, the Russians have a response to shoot
[53:30.720 --> 53:35.040]  down more of our aircraft to sink ships, then things escalate very, very quickly, this
[53:35.040 --> 53:40.560]  is insane, a guy with a brain tumor, who's completely psychotic, John McCain, who's well
[53:40.560 --> 53:45.080]  known for being a psychotic, just let's pull some photos of McCain lately, he just looks
[53:45.080 --> 53:50.240]  completely deranged, this guy's undergoing chemo therapy, which makes you even more
[53:50.240 --> 53:55.000]  unstable, especially when it's in the brain, they call it chemo brain, this guy is the
[53:55.000 --> 53:59.000]  guy that helped fund the radical, a jihadist that helped invade the whole area, went over
[53:59.000 --> 54:02.640]  there with Marco Rubio and the rest of them, and Lindsey Graham, there they are with the
[54:02.640 --> 54:08.920]  ISIS and al-Qaeda leaders, let's talk worst case scenario, this thing kicks off.
[54:08.920 --> 54:18.440]  Well, Alex, you know, I'll be really personal now, and really sincere so to say, I'm really
[54:18.440 --> 54:25.800]  pissed off by these people who are warmongers, because warmongers are not going to fight
[54:25.800 --> 54:33.440]  themselves, McCain is not going to take an M16 rifle and fight me somewhere in the deserts
[54:33.440 --> 54:40.120]  of Syria, he's going to send some folks from Texas, from Arizona, from New Mexico, from
[54:40.120 --> 54:47.120]  Idaho, and send them to death, and make us kill each other.
[54:47.120 --> 54:52.240]  These warmongers are not telling, I will lead you to fight the Russians, because I think
[54:52.240 --> 54:58.360]  that they are not right, they tell you that go and die for me, because I think that Russians
[54:58.360 --> 55:03.880]  have crossed my way, crossed my road, and this is really disturbing and terrible.
[55:03.880 --> 55:11.740]  And you know, there are some situations where war is inevitable, we are not in this kind
[55:11.740 --> 55:13.240]  of situation.
[55:13.240 --> 55:19.160]  Russian U.S. have a lot of problems, we have a lot of controversies, we have a lot of things
[55:19.160 --> 55:26.600]  we do not agree on, but we don't have a single real reason for a major war, and we must understand
[55:26.600 --> 55:32.920]  this, and I want to be clear with your audience, who I really respect, we don't want to fight
[55:32.920 --> 55:39.000]  with you, we don't want to fight the real Americans, that will be sent in case of war,
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.000]  ordinary Americans will be sent to fight for the interests of globalists, and globalists
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.880]  will be somewhere in the bunkers, on the islands, or wherever, safe.
[55:47.880 --> 55:53.600]  We are going to die, us and you, and they will live, and I think that it's not right.
[55:53.600 --> 55:57.800]  If you are a war war monger, go to Syria, Mr. McCain.
[55:57.800 --> 56:05.720]  I wish you to recover from the illness, grab a rifle, and go and fight in Syria with someone.
[56:05.720 --> 56:12.520]  That's the only answer, and all the other war mongers on CNN, on BBC, or wherever, go
[56:12.520 --> 56:18.840]  grab a gun, and risk your life, and fight for ideals you believe in.
[56:18.840 --> 56:24.320]  I don't tell with a right or wrong, if you're ready to kill for it, go forward and do this,
[56:24.320 --> 56:29.200]  meet our special forces, meet our soldiers, and try to kill them.
[56:29.200 --> 56:30.200]  We'll see that.
[56:30.200 --> 56:33.920]  We're going to go to break and come back and talk about ways out of this, like we had
[56:33.920 --> 56:38.040]  five years ago in our own military, our own people said we'll not fight for al-Qaeda,
[56:38.040 --> 56:41.240]  then how they rebranded, we'll be right back with our guest on the other side, then Nigel
[56:41.240 --> 56:45.920]  Farage, joins us about six minutes into the next hour from the UK with his analysis of
[56:45.920 --> 56:46.920]  this.
[56:46.920 --> 56:50.460]  Before we go any further, everybody knows that we have the purest deep-earth crystal
[56:50.460 --> 56:52.080]  source form of iodine.
[56:52.080 --> 56:53.080]  It's just pure iodine.
[56:53.080 --> 56:56.800]  Our enemies have tested it in the news, they go, it's weird, it's not sodium iodine, it's
[56:56.800 --> 56:59.240]  not this iodine, it's pure iodine.
[56:59.240 --> 57:00.240]  Yeah, that's the whole point.
[57:00.240 --> 57:01.880]  It is pure 999999 iodine.
[57:01.880 --> 57:06.600]  It's very hard to get it, if you get it from the oil companies when they drill, it's a
[57:06.600 --> 57:08.280]  side derivative, it's very hard to get.
[57:08.280 --> 57:11.200]  For the second time in the five-year history of this, we're not even sure we can get any
[57:11.200 --> 57:12.200]  more of it.
[57:12.200 --> 57:14.520]  We're working on a different type of iodine, quite frankly, because this is getting more
[57:14.520 --> 57:15.840]  and more expensive.
[57:15.840 --> 57:19.440]  So look for some I don't know if it'll be as good as this. This is the best out there
[57:19.440 --> 57:21.440]  And I think we'll probably get more
[57:21.440 --> 57:24.720]  We've got enough for a couple more batches, but it'll be a while till more comes in

[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:29.240]  Andre Asanasi of is our guest for the five minutes of Nigel Farage is joining us
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:33.120]  I'm gonna talk about a positive way out of this but first for TV viewers and radio listeners
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:40.960]  The sound of cruise missiles launching last year what 40 plus of them blowing up an airfield with no evidence that the Russians launched the chemical attack
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:48.120]  The U.S. argument is and the argument that we could be getting is well
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:52.600]  The sod city give up its chemicals and there were some chemical boxes at the airport
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:58.680]  Well, then why in Hades with the U.S. bomb open-air chemicals and there was a town about a quarter mile away
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.680]  It would have killed those people
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.320]  Yeah, you blow up hundreds of tons of chemical weapons it kills people
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:18.280]  So what happens if that was one target was it 40 plus a member Tomahawk's got launched a memory service. Let's look it up
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.480]  I'm it may have been lesser more memory says 40 Tomahawks. Yeah, let's see how good my memory is
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.760]  I think 47 or something was the number. Let's do an Alex Jones
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.680]  Factoid memory test, but let me ask our guests the time we have left if they're gonna hit 70 targets
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:37.840]  We're talking about thousands of missiles potentially or at least hundreds what happens if that happens
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.800]  We already talked about it and in the worst case and what is the way out of this?
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.600]  Well
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:53.280]  There is no clear way out of situation in case the missiles will be launched toward the Russian
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.320]  infrastructure and Russian military servicemen will have to defend ourselves and we have
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:04.600]  the most modern and effective anti-missile systems they as 400
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:10.920]  That's actually one of which is able to down 32 targets at once
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:14.520]  so that's the main point and
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:21.480]  The way out of this is just rationality. I'm pretty sure that now in the White House and
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:26.320]  in Washington there is a strong fight and I'm hoping that
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:32.260]  The side of sanity at the side of rationality will win over
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.000]  war mongers and globalists and
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.760]  What we saw in the recent?
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.000]  Trump's tweets and we're now in a situation where
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.120]  the history of humanity is written in Twitter and
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:54.120]  What we see is that Trump is saying that by now there is no clear plan to
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.120]  Fire to shoot
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.400]  missiles on Syrian territory, especially in near future and
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.320]  Well, yes, Trump somehow I said that the US
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.040]  Did the main job in killing Isis? Well, okay?
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:16.520]  Probably Russia is ready to share some some glory with our American friends
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.840]  but first but first we must understand that there should be no war and
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:26.880]  And there should be understanding that Syria is a sovereign state and everyone should respect
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.000]  The right of any people and any nation leave here. We have no business
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.480]  Especially when Hillary and Obama started it will Andre in closing I read what Trump said and I'm glad he's saying hey
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.400]  I never said I'd hit him or win and because Mattis is starting to back down on this
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:47.600]  But how do they suddenly get to Trump to say Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.920]  Get ready Russia because they will be coming nice and new and smart
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:54.920]  You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:58.200]  The US has been caught with the rebels that have been caught doing it
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.160]  Now I don't say Trump or all of America, but the global is deep state
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:07.360]  So this is pure projection and it's just it's the first thing Trump's done. It's like a punch in the stomach
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.800]  Well, maybe someone stole his iPhone. I don't know. Yeah
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:20.280]  So they were the only answer sometimes I feel like someone is stealing the phone of Trump and texting some terrible stuff
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.160]  I hope I hope that this is some kind of a very
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:32.040]  Complex complicated game. We cannot understand just without clear and enough information
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.600]  Well, you know, we did that on DACA
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.680]  We did it on the DACA and the guns and I know for a fact he does that but you can't do that with nuclear war in Russia
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:44.400]  You just you can't play those games with nuclear weapons. Thank you so much. Andre. Thank you so much
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:51.640]  It was 59 Tomahawks. I said 47 48 my memory was more than I thought 59 for one target. How many will be 70 targets?
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:55.000]  Thank you so much. We'll be back with an Isle Farage and more stay with us
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:03.120]  You know if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products we have it in Fuller's life
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:10.120]  It take hours Michael's the X plus and now is a lower price. It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.960]  It knocks out the yeast the mold
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:17.280]  The candida it's back in stock the real red pill. It's been sold out for months
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.880]  It's got the pregluenone. That's the precursor all the natural hormones in your body

[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.520]  Super high-quality silver and a lot more without you we couldn't do it

[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:53.680]  It's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word again
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:06:06.760]  Thank you so much for being part of the second American Revolution. You are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.280]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:29.120]  From deep in the heart of FEMA region 6 Austin, Texas transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.640]  And Nigel Farage joins us for the next 10 minutes
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.600]  You can follow him at Twitter Nigel underscore Farage
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:41.960]  I'm gonna go over his whole background because that would take the 10 minutes we have but he's helped lead the populist movement
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:45.680]  Not just in the UK and and Briggs it but in Europe now
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:51.960]  We have Victor Orban with a huge landslide victory against Soros's reported 50 million plus dollars put in
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:58.520]  We see nationalism spreading a free market nationalism all over the world and so a true modern
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.360]  Paul revere. I mean Magna Carta, whatever you want to call it Nigel Farage joins us
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:10.040]  I want to get into obviously it was five six years ago that England led the charge to not attack Syria
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:17.240]  Not that Assad's a good guy now we have a lady obviously in political trouble may the prime minister wanting a war
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:24.000]  But now Mattis has come out secretary defense today and said there's no evidence the Russians did this so
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:30.520]  Wow, and we're talking about potentially a wider war a new world war many analysts say Nigel Farage
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:34.480]  I know you've been speaking to this in your syndicated radio and TV program
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.040]  What is the latest from the UK?
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:44.080]  Well, remember in 2013 it was in fact British public opinion that shifted our politicians
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:51.400]  That stopped us getting involved in Syria and don't forget the object of the government at the time was to arm the rebels
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.280]  Alex if we'd done that we'd have armed ISIS
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:58.560]  It would have been mad and actually it was British public opinion
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:06.400]  affecting our politicians that stopped Obama and America from getting involved in this so I'm a great believer actually with all these things
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:14.400]  Trust middle England trust middle America. They tend to get it right more than London or Washington, DC
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:21.520]  Now mrs. May does appear keen to get involved militarily all I can tell her is be careful
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:29.280]  Because public opinion now against intervention is probably even stronger than it was four years ago
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:36.320]  And there's one bit of good news Alex. I think the president's tweets and Madison's comments today
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:42.560]  I think they've kind of rethought the stuff that was being said in DC yesterday morning
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:46.280]  They're taking a break. They're having a pause and you know something
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  Even if even if you prove to me
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.600]  conclusively that a sad but ordered that chemical attack on those civilians
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.240]  Which I kind of doubt because he's winning anyway, but that's by the by
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.920]  Even if you prove that to me
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:09.160]  What good would massive military strikes that could possibly topple him from the leadership
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:18.720]  Give us a massive vacuum and let ISIS you've just been beaten on the battlefield back in there is no argument Alex here for intervention
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:26.040]  What do you make of the Russian ambassador to the EU and the Russian ambassador to the UN saying the same rebels have been caught three times
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:32.760]  Even the UN says that staging these provocations and that elements of the deep state in the US and I know that Trump's been fighting with the general
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:39.160]  Some of them are on a side some aren't who are actually trying to reconstitute ISIS under a new name and the Russians are saying we wouldn't do this
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.760]  We're pulling out
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.620]  And and they're pointing the finger towards the rebels saying they staged a false flag
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:52.160]  Well, you know, I've no idea, you know, but but let's put it like this if it wasn't a sad that did it
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:59.320]  You know, you can make arguments about the deep state doing it, but equally don't forget that ISIS themselves a couple of years ago
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:05.080]  We're on record for using chemical weapons no fewer than 52 times
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.920]  ISIS could quite easily have done this
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:17.000]  Hoping the world would blame a sad and the Russians particularly in the wake of the arguments that are still going on about the poisonings that took place in
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:24.200]  Salisbury, England, so the answer is we don't know and look come on the biggest decision
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:33.240]  Government ever makes is to get involved in an act of war and you should not do it unless you've got a long term
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:39.160]  Strategy where Iraq went wrong and where Libya went wrong is we were short term
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:44.720]  Trying to get rid of leaders. We didn't like without any thought for what came afterwards
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:48.560]  We must not not not make that same mistake again
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.040]  Well, that's another thing with the Iraq war that I know that you were against the second one
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.840]  I know Trump was against it. That's on record as real libertarians real nationalist
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:03.200]  The neo cons and others didn't think about what happens when you kick Saddam out you get something even worse
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:11.160]  Let's not forget it was the CIA that put Saddam in and and then you were moving or we removed our allies in Egypt and then something 50 times worse
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:18.920]  Got in I mean, it's just absurd to never think about the second and third and fourth moves that are going to happen
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:23.920]  What's wrong with these elements both in the left and right that just love war
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.080]  Yeah, it's become the new the new let's show our people how strong we are
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:34.880]  Let's distract their attention away from them to the extent to which we're removing their liberties and their freedoms
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:38.960]  Let's show them what strong leaders are. Let's go to war and we keep going to war
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:45.080]  We keep getting it wrong and Alex. You forgot to mention Libya a moment ago, you know, we got rid of Gaddafi
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:48.640]  All right, you know, I wouldn't want to take Gaddafi home to meet my mom
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:53.160]  Yeah, but but the fact is with Gaddafi gone
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:12:00.360]  Isis is back the flow of migrants across the Mediterranean have chiefly been coming from Libya
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:06.760]  And did you know Alex there are now open slave markets back in Libya, haven't we done?
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:12.160]  Well, so given this dreadful record of failure, let's just think please Wow
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:18.680]  It's it's just amazing. Hillary came. She saw Gaddafi died and now we've got millions of people pouring across
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:24.600]  Into Spain into Italy and the EU Navy they want to form wants to stop Italy and Spain
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.600]  From stopping these, you know people from coming in. I mean, this is just completely insane
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:37.960]  Completely absurd and you've talked about that the bigger EU plan to collapse the Middle East in North Africa and flood Europe with
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:43.680]  Islamist or bonds victory stands against that. You're a leading expert on this. Why is the left ally with radical Islam?
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:45.680]  Why are they trying to flood?
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:49.760]  Because they hate Christianity. They can't I mean, you know, they they deny
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:58.240]  Absolutely our Judeo-Christian culture, which if you think about it actually are the roots completely of our nations and our civilization
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:03.560]  They deny that they also don't forget Alex. They want to abolish the nation state
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:04.920]  They want to get rid of it
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:12.880]  They want to replace it with the globalist project and the European Union is the prototype for the new world order
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.240]  Do you know if Hillary had won that election?
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:21.240]  Last year she was gonna sign America up to get really close to this kind of thing
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.760]  So, you know, we may sit here right now Alex and be a bit critical of Trump
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:28.520]  But on many other things he's got things right and when you send a message
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:35.940]  When Angela Merkel sends a message as many of you as want to come can come. What do you think they're gonna do?
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:42.040]  Well, you're absolutely right a Nigel Farage is our guest here for just a few more minutes
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:47.040]  And that's that's where I was going next is Merkel famously on the stage with the Facebook head
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:52.760]  Zuckerberg saying don't worry. We're gonna censor anybody that criticizes the EU the EU trying to pass laws
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:58.320]  You've been part of the EU parliament that that's that's just a ceremony on you've witnessed that now in the UK
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:02.240]  They're arresting people that criticize Islam or say that there are two genders
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.240]  They're trying to restrict free speech here
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:10.380]  Don't we need in Europe and the UK and the US to really get on the offense in demand that free speech be
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:17.200]  Exercise and be protected because the left is trying to bully it out of existence. They filed 15 frivolous lawsuits on me now
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.280]  Yeah, I'm working in today the lawyers see it their total frauds
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:26.000]  They're overturned as fast as they come in but it's just they are so authoritarian the left is so authoritarian
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:28.440]  Yes, the Liberals
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:35.600]  Actually are very illiberal in fact the Liberals have become the very fascists that they try and criticize with their
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.400]  Retirica look what's really happening here, you know, don't underestimate
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:45.920]  How massive the seismic shock of 2016 was the victory of Brexit the victory of Trump
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:53.720]  You know, we're winning look at hungry the other day. We are winning but it doesn't feel like we're winning because the left and the state are
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:58.880]  Fighting back with all their might and you know something if we can resist
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:06.200]  This politically correct charge this attempt to stop us thinking and speaking freely if we can resist that
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:11.680]  Then our victory actually will be complete. So don't get down everybody. Don't get depressed
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.640]  They're behaving like this because we're beating them

[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.440]  I think the globalists have wanted to have
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:47.720]  Some form of conflict with Russia as an argument for us all to to surrender our national sovereignty and give it up to a
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:53.320]  Higher global level. They've wanted it for years and now they see their opportunity and we

[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:06.920]  We went out and looked at what the top? Neutropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy stamina
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:09.440]  mental clarity you name it and we
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:14.160]  Created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there. It's very simple
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.480]  We went out and like what is the top? What is the best? We'll just put even more product in we'll make it better leading competitors
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:22.160]  But two dollars a product in it sell it for 60 bucks
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:27.240]  We put ten dollars in it and sell it for 30 bucks. It's nineteen ninety five right now
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:31.480]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line? Neutropic for nineteen ninety five
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:36.160]  Believe me, we're selling it for thirty five dollars on average. We need that fifteen twenty bucks
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.760]  We make to fund this operation in the face the global thrust of it
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:42.120]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:48.920]  I want to shell it all out before the big supply comes in and I want people that haven't tried brain force to try it and find out

[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:03.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:22.640]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:36.400]  You know, I think Nigel Farage is the best-spoken person I know
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:42.360]  He is the best-spoken person out there and
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:47.120]  Whoever Tyler Durgan is over zero heads. He's just incredibly intelligent as well
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:53.760]  And I'm not engaged in a butt-kissing operation here. It's just when you talk to somebody that is a hundred percent on and
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:56.680]  Knows everything you know and more
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:03.560]  I know they've tried to kill at least three times the EU police say no, they've tried to kill Farage confirmed repeatedly
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.760]  His airplane crashed almost killed the pilot very suspicious
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:13.840]  But that's a side issue where they confirmed it was taking the bolts off his car the lug nuts
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:16.120]  So when he gets up to 60 miles an hour the wheels come off
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:23.400]  That's happened a couple times you name it his wife got him to quasi retire back to brokerage firm stuff
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.400]  he was very successful and
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.360]  They tried to steal Briggs it so he came back out of retirement
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:34.720]  And you know three times they've confirmed they tried to kill him and there's other times they've tried to kill him as well
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:38.120]  three times in the news where police say foul play and
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.800]  so I
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.040]  Don't blame me wanting to retire and it's not a thing of cowardice either
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:47.360]  It's like he started UKIP 25 years ago and
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:55.720]  Took it to you know dominance in the EU, but the European Union Parliament is elected, but ceremonial
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:00.000]  the permanent bureaucracy runs everything with Yulker the
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:08.040]  Grandson of the top Nazi I mean after Hitler there was Yulker's grandfather and his dad. It was an officer and
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:16.320]  That's what's so weird is like Soros is an old Nazi and then Yulker runs the unelected EU and owns
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.920]  Luxembourg because the Nazis took it by force
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.520]  And then I'm sitting there at the press conference
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:25.600]  Monday in
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.600]  DC
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:37.240]  About all these anti-free speech lawsuits filed against us twice, which our lawyers have never seen before they're so unconstitutional and so ridiculous and
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:46.520]  Income people for the American way right wing watch media matters think progress
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.840]  And
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:52.880]  All these anti free speech groups and I sit there and I go you're fun about Soros
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:57.320]  They go no we're not and you go to the Federal Elections Commission right there and
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:05.080]  It says it all right there number one funder George Soros and they're always the snarky
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:12.240]  Pinheads and it's just like what are people funded by a Nazi collaborator
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:15.280]  Doing in my face
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:23.680]  Is this a twilight zone episode and then all these leftist law firms in in New York and DC and Texas file lawsuits
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:31.280]  On us now on a weekly basis that are totally made up, but they put the defamation in the lawsuit
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.440]  So
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:43.720]  They can get away with so they're defaming me trying to destroy me trying to scare everybody off from info wars as
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:50.160]  As if they don't understand everybody sees us being demonized and attacked every night on Comedy Central every week
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:55.360]  By Stephen Colbert on national television by all the other channels. They'll just have you'll be in a random movie
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.640]  and
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:03.720]  The child molesters named Alex Jones the other movie the guy that's kidnapped kids and got him in the basement named Alex Jones and
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:12.120]  Homeland the characters based on Alex Jones, and he doesn't like black people as a terrorist and they'll just have random movies out
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:15.880]  There where you're sitting there watching you don't even know you're in the movie and the guy goes
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:21.320]  Oh, it's Jones taught me to hate bleep bleep bleep. I won't say as I'll edit it and and that's why I don't like
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:27.140]  These different groups and you're just like oh my god, they are really scared of me
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:38.280]  And all I'm saying is they think you're really dumb, but see leftist and people are all about selling out psychological studies show it
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.920]  What is it six times more likely not to give a charity nine times are likely to steal
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:49.840]  Major liberal universities down the studies you can pull them up type in liberals or more stingy liberals steal more because they just burst your signal
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.840]  They're not liberals they're liars
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.520]  And they think
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:02.720]  That when they attack me and they think when they lie about me that I'm all about what people are saying about me like they are
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:06.520]  And I'm all about money and they don't get it makes me fight hard for me
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:11.880]  And they don't get it makes me fight harder. It makes me more focused you can ask the crew around here when I'm under attack
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.560]  I'm like a laser beam
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.560]  There's not a lot. I don't miss
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:18.720]  When I'm not really under a lot of attack. I kind of anyone do the show
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:28.200]  They just don't get it standing for something having something inside yourself that doesn't care what everybody else says it's called leadership
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.560]  And I am a leader
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:38.880]  And that's why they hate my guts and I'm so honored that I'm not with all the cowardly timid souls
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:44.640]  The crouched down and licked the hands that feed them let them forget that they were our brethren and our and our countrymen
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:54.280]  Because I know not what course others may choose but as for me give me liberty or give me death you figure that out yet
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:59.760]  It's Patrick Henry the war is already begun
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:06.520]  The globalists are already suppressing people all over the planet. They're incredibly evil
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:19.920]  But thanks to people like Nigel Farage and Ron Paul and Donald Trump
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:26.760]  We have a fighting chance and you know, I know what happened with Trump
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.320]  Kind of from sources
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:36.280]  And by that I know what he did on DACA. I know he did on the second amendment
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:40.920]  I was told after the fact that I even figured it out that people that talked to him. So I haven't talked to him in a while I
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:49.480]  Was told exactly what would happen and watch Trump wants you to know that that's what's going on here and
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.480]  you heard
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.440]  Ted Nugent on
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:01.480]  Last week and he said we're not supposed to tip your hand, but I will and that
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.400]  You know on the second amendment deal
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:05.240]  He was never gonna get rid of any of it
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:10.760]  He wanted the Democrats to come up and say okay repeal it and I sat there in Nugent's house when he told me
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:15.240]  Trump believes they're gonna call for the repeal when he does this just like they did on DACA
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:17.240]  They called for no borders at all
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.680]  And I asked Nugent off here
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:24.200]  He told me who told him that the Congress from the talk to Trump and then another guy talked to and I'll leave it at that
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.400]  very close to the president
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:39.440]  And then three weeks later exactly what Nugent said happened and so Trump had them all pressuring him and saying you know
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.520]  They're gonna say you're a Russian agent if you don't bomb them and the proof's gonna come out
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:45.320]  You're gonna get in trouble and blah blah blah and Trump said uh-uh
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:51.200]  I'll go ahead and put out some of this rhetoric for you and watch the the American people are gonna hate my guts
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.200]  You're wrong about this
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:57.560]  So I'm gonna go ahead and do this so the Russians flip out and you see how close we are to all this
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.840]  So I don't have to strike them because they're gonna strike back and you know they didn't do it
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:06.880]  You know the rebels that the globalists and McMaster involved with are involved in it and McMaster and all of them kept saying
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.480]  We're gonna still take a sought-out and Trump would say no you're not
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.080]  That's the type of mutiny and the type of insanity and the type of garbage that's going on inside the government. I
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.560]  Was told
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:26.960]  by folks in government while I was in DC high level mid-level low level that there are still whole hiring freezes going on because the
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:30.560]  Democrats are all embedded and won't hire anybody and won't do anything
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.800]  It's just absolute
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:39.640]  Tyranny going on we come back. I'm gonna open the phones up recap the World War three news

[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:56.760]  That could end the world

[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:21.720]  We only have a hundred and fifty percent then it helps funder operation
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:27.520]  Well now it's fifty percent off that means we've got a twenty five percent markup

[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:15.320]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:20.080]  1960s researchers in France notice that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:27.940]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:34.820]  We now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.640]  Pollen block is natural and effective
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:44.440]  It is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:49.040]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body?
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:57.080]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to info wars life calm and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets

[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:42.720]  8777 789 Alex I
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:49.080]  Would suggest you call in I want to get your topics on the Russia situation and the neocons are crazy enough to want to strike
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:55.880]  70 targets more than 20 of them Russian which will kill hundreds of Russians you've got Pompeo testifying just hours ago
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.980]  He's still testifying on Capitol Hill
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:06.240]  That we've killed hundreds of Russians the people we were working with to take out the Isis and al-Qaeda forces that were 95 percent
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.840]  Of the rebel forces according to our own Pentagon
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:12.200]  So you've got the bureaucrats that want the war that hate the Russians
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:17.200]  You got our own military that understands what's going on and he's worked with the Russians in Afghanistan when they helped us
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:19.600]  Have for 9-11. It is just crazy
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:26.000]  8777 889 Alex first-time callers by the way, let's give folks a chance at least in this hour for first-time callers
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:29.520]  8777 789 2539
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:35.920]  Can you believe that there's been a media blackout on the Russian ambassador to the EU the Russian ambassador?
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.400]  to
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.400]  the US to the UN
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:48.000]  Saying that we have evidence that the western-backed rebel stage the terror attack and that that's not in our news
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:55.960]  Day one our media accused them with no evidence and Secretary of Defense Mattis this morning said there is no evidence
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:57.960]  And they're still looking at it
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:03.280]  That should be getting more coverage as well this is just huge
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.640]  You attack those Russian forces there in that proxy war that
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:14.720]  Obama and Hillary started it could kick off a new world war and that's what most analysts say
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.480]  It's just incredible I
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:24.760]  Want to get some into Mueller before I go into your calls to there's been some big developments on that front
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:27.720]  But just briefly while we're getting your calls lined up
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:35.400]  When I say I'm gonna shell out a body's ultimate turmeric formula and it has a 95 percent
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:39.760]  Curcumin and level and that no other companies out there that we've talked to can even get anything close to that
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:45.040]  That's a fact and it's sold out in two weeks will be at a price so low and people that know turmeric and its amazing
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:49.160]  Properties bought it quickly. Well, it's come back in as 25% off
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:56.600]  I just can't offer it at 50 because that's so close to the price of what the product costs that we can't fund our operation and fight
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:58.240]  All these sorrows operations the rest of it
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:02.440]  But if you'll just get the bodies and read about all the great benefits and attributes of it
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.800]  You're gonna help us defeat these people very very easily
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:10.640]  Because they know these are all frivolous lawsuits they filed but it takes time to throw them out and defeat them
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:17.160]  That is set up a war room got counsel deal with it, you know as it comes in they're trying to shut down the first amendment
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.200]  This is diabolical
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:23.600]  But if you stand against them and get great products that you and your family need it's came over take ikaran
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:29.720]  Kidney and liver cleanse with all the known healthy compounds and concentrated herbs that help flush out your kidneys and liver
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:35.800]  Now you do it for your fuel injectors and stuff. Why not your carburetors?
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.800]  Why not do it for this in full wars life calm alpha power?
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:45.280]  Sold out very quickly because it's got the known herbs and healthy compounds for libido stamina energy
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.760]  Particularly for men, but it works great for women as well
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.240]  vital male androgen
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.240]  biosynthesis promoter
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:56.240]  You've got the real red pill that goes great with that. You've got brain force that the media is always
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.360]  Demonizing and attacking as they know it's such a popular formula
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:02.160]  But the big one is x2
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:07.560]  And by the way, Millie Weaver's got a report. Well, I want them to retweet that out
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:12.240]  She found when she was in DC an old boxcar museum
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.360]  of you know
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:22.160]  Dining cars as Smithsonian when she's got the report and
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:31.080]  It says the benefits of iodine everyone knows the benefits of iodine and toothpaste from like 1910 and back then they put it in
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:33.080]  Toothpaste. It was the good halogen not fluoride
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:37.600]  Then they took it out and put fluoride the bad halogen in that's what I'm telling you
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:42.440]  We didn't just come up with super blue toothpaste with iodine and colloidal silver in it because
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.800]  We just thought of it off the top our head
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:51.640]  We did research on how IQs were 15 points lower until they started doing that and then they took it out again
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:53.640]  And now the IQs are dropping again
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:59.840]  But instead of having yet. Yeah, there it is iodine and that company by the way still around they don't put iodine in it
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.760]  There's all the ads for it. I mean
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:10.800]  Well, but again, you can just search engine Google won't show it to you. I've got a banger somewhere else or start page
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:18.560]  And you can go read huge, you know articles kind of reports you name it about iodine and this is the pure iodine
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:20.360]  That's not bound from deep earth crystals
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:25.320]  And we have to get it from oil companies that hit it as they're going down and in gas drilling
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.400]  It's between 7 and 12,000 feet
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:31.240]  It's very very expensive for them to stop and then extract the crystals
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:33.800]  We're the only people we know of and I keep trying to find
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:39.080]  Groups great. He's a great guy, but it's so expensive for us that the markups not very big
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.920]  It's the best seller if we could just get it cheaper and sell it cheaper
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:47.640]  We could do that but instead the price for us getting it is going up because now we've made a big industry out of it
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:49.640]  So they're trying to charge him more
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:55.960]  Iodine awareness is coming back and so I'm told that some big cosmetic companies are trying to block us and get this for themselves
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  So it's gonna be put in hair product
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.280]  So that's the price of being a trailblazer
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.360]  infowarslife.com infowarsstore.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:14.040]  This is about to sell out at current sales rates in about a week and a half
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:20.080]  So I'm gonna have to in a couple days get rid of the 25% off. It's already discounted massively twenty ninety five
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:25.600]  Again, you can't go to the store and buy the iodine there and drink that that'll eat a hole in your stomach
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:30.160]  Because it's not real iodine. It's mixed with all these toxins and bound to things. This is pure
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:35.200]  This is kept in a DEA lab because you can use the raw stuff for manufacturing things
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:41.480]  It turns purple when you lay it down on the ground and turns into a gas that that's it's all proprietary how they do it and
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.480]  It's it's harder and harder to get it the price goes up on our next shipment
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.760]  It's not groups fault. It's I've seen the contracts and it's harder for him to get it
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:55.880]  It's it and and quite frankly, you know groups a great guy
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:59.880]  I don't want anybody we've gone around trying to find ourselves and you just can't get it
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:06.200]  And we're looking at another iodine formula if this stops. I mean we we've gone that far
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:13.160]  To we're looking at a total iodine product this is the original base iodine, but some people absorb things better
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:15.280]  This is obviously the best
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:19.240]  But some people can't even absorb the basic iodine. It's like 2%
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:25.360]  So there's a the three different types of iodine but broken up into three different types. It may be better for some people
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:30.360]  We don't think so. I'll be honest with you. We're looking for a replacement right now. That's that's how far down the line
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:32.360]  We are on
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:37.600]  This we had a very clean seaweed based five years ago and people got a hold of them and blocked them from us getting that as a
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:45.040]  Political sabotage is economic sabotage. There's espionage economic espionage with the French word for your financial war is is is
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.800]  espionage
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:55.440]  Industrial espionage trying to stop us and so we have this shipment moral come in in June
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:57.440]  They say and then we don't know
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:04.000]  So info or store.com info wars life.com or triple a two five three three one three nine
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:09.720]  This is again not that thing where people try to make things scarce or whatever so they sell more of it
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:14.280]  I mean that is the fact so it does sell more of it, which is a catch 22. Yeah, we can find ourselves now
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:16.120]  But what happens if we can't get it?
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:19.640]  So we're looking around groups looking around. We're working hard groups a great guy
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:24.040]  You know stuff like icorin or bodies and we can keep getting that product
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:29.560]  It's just to have it sourced and then organic and tested sometimes things get held up. That's why their shortage is there
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:34.480]  We have a good clean top iodine on the toothpaste and all that it's not this deep earth type
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.200]  But it's listed there
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:41.640]  It's also another type in the mouthwash the immune gargle that my dad has developed expanding the super blue product line
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:44.080]  But I'm done plugging the point is that
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:50.040]  this really is an original amazing product and it's very very special and
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:55.680]  They are after us. I mean this is industrial. They're trying to block us and I
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.360]  don't like to tell you about stuff to look it's down to the line, but
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:05.480]  The price is going to go up on it regardless the new low price is going to be higher because we're gonna have to pay more and
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:08.040]  many of our products again
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.880]  On average our products 40% of
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:16.280]  the cost you see on the sticker is what it's costing us I
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:20.040]  Mean nobody does that
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:26.920]  The average person puts $5 in a product if it's high-end and sells it for $39 people aren't putting
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:30.720]  $15-20 in a product and selling it for 40. That's what we do
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:36.320]  The toothpaste has got a higher markup as it costs us three bucks just in product and everything else sell for
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:41.680]  $9.95 there's just not enough funding in it to sell it, you know for a hundred percent markup for six bucks. Can't do it
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:42.480]  We go bankrupt
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:47.920]  We need your support info wars live comm info or store.com or triple a two five three three one three nine
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:52.800]  And please support local affiliates as well that is critical become a sponsor or just tithe your local station
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:55.760]  Who's standing up for free speech that that's religious freedom as well
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:59.520]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:07.760]  It's micro zx plus lower price more ingredients because we scaled up signed to your contract with even bigger organic
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:10.400]  manufacturer and producer
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:16.800]  Scalability but now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39 50% off

[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:26.320]  Broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  We're gonna do a report on it
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:36.520]  David Knight just ran in here who does the morning show does a great job from 8 a.m. To 11 a.m
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:42.840]  He just ran in here and he said man my wife just called me. She watches you and us on Facebook on the live streams there
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:50.320]  Because it's a little bit better quality than our streams and he said you're hard limited to 200 viewers
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:56.000]  Now let's go ahead and click on that so we can specifically show them the player that is 222
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:03.160]  You are hard-coded there now normally there's 10,000 just on that stream alone, and that's not a big part of our audience
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:08.120]  It's the archives. It's the other live shows the special events most people listen on their local radio station
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:10.680]  Or they watch on our streams or listen to the audio streams
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:15.480]  Or they get the podcast later, and we're on four different streams on Facebook as well, but the main one
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:17.480]  I
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:23.480]  That has that has that has millions and millions of likes
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:27.560]  Has it limited down depending on the browser to a couple hundred people?
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:34.800]  Now why does that matter? I was sitting there at the National Press Club on
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:37.360]  Monday
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.360]  When I was
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:43.200]  Not giving a speech I was looking at Rob doing what we call the Warhammer
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:46.400]  So it looks like a big Warhammer three phones on top of tripod
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.000]  YouTube
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:57.760]  Twitter and Facebook of a hugely promoted event and guess how many people it said was watching on each one
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.480]  603
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:06.160]  601 602 and I almost shot video of it that people were talking to me constantly
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:13.880]  But that's what they do if I go on some random person's Facebook show that normally has a few hundred listeners
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.400]  It has hundreds of thousands by the time I leave because they're able to actually share
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:25.120]  Up until the election when I did Facebook. I would have millions sometimes watching but always hundreds of thousands
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:30.800]  But then Facebook called and said we want you to fly to New York we want to meet with you
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:36.440]  This is all off record the who they were the specifics and you'll be able to continue to reach millions
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.440]  This is your audience. We're letting you reach your audience
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:44.080]  But I didn't go meet with them. I didn't kiss Zuckerberg's butt and so boom
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:47.760]  I've been shadow banned to where you have to be on the page itself
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:52.560]  But now that's not enough. I'm flooded with emails text
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:58.240]  Comments on Twitter Facebook and YouTube that it kicks me off. I'm allowed to watch everybody else
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:03.960]  But you it kicks me off. I'm not allowed to watch you. It's it's just not playing. What's going on?
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:07.080]  Well, it came out Zuckerberg admits it
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:13.400]  This is the censorship. This is their operations. This is how they're shadow banning conservatives
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:19.480]  This is all behind the scenes project Veritas caught it on video and they don't let you share the video
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:22.680]  They don't let you share the articles or they unsubscribe you. You know Mike Adams
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:28.640]  Had hundreds of millions of views on his health ranger site. They took it down for a few months for no reason
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:30.640]  They were stored it up at the weekend, but guess what?
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:34.200]  One third of his subscribers were gone
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:38.520]  They unsubscribed same thing. We have two plus billion views on
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:43.900]  Our YouTube our main YouTube channel. It now goes in reverse most of the time
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:46.640]  down to a billion and a half and
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:52.100]  Thousands of the 33,000 36,000 whatever it's up to videos are just deleted
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:59.320]  They just delete them constantly so listen people say we'll do your own thing
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:04.280]  We've got info wars.com forward slash show. We're on threshold radio. We're on TV stations
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:07.760]  We're growing there, but ladies and gentlemen if they can no platform us on the web
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:14.080]  They can do it to you or anybody else and they've hidden this they've discriminated against us when they get caught they back off of it
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:22.040]  This is an attempt to silence Christians and conservatives and nationalists, but we've never seen Twitter Facebook and YouTube
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:30.520]  Blocking our live streams like they are today because they know I'm pushing a 34-hour emergency broadcast
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:35.560]  Saying no war with Russia. Don't strike Russian forces in Syria
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:43.960]  Trump is wrong to sit there and say that he's gonna shoot down Russian aircraft or he's gonna attack them or missiles are coming and
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:49.940]  Trump came out did a 180 day and said he never said he was he's not gonna do it now and
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:53.960]  Mattis comes out and says they haven't seen evidence yet that Assad did this no kidding
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:58.920]  Assad has the Russians pulling out Trump just declared victory
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:04.900]  So they just had massive censorship. They're testing it for the 2018
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:10.720]  They're gonna do it again right before the election. They're just wearing us out getting everybody used to us whining
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  So that when we get censored again, no one wants to tune in or hear about it
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.360]  They're weakening us dialing us back ahead of 2018
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:22.240]  Well, guess what?
[01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:29.480]  They can file a thousand lawsuits and we'll be able to deflect them and hold them off for at least three years even if they were
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:32.040]  Legitimate, I've got top counsel on analysis up
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:34.920]  But they're found them every week now
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:40.360]  So we have to countersuit and that's where the real money comes in I have to start
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:45.880]  And the good part about I'm suing me a bunch of these in Texas is I can then get
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:49.720]  Serious damages under the slapback provision here when it's shown to be a
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:54.880]  You know something that was ridiculous and statutorily not correct and it was done to shut down my speech
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:01.040]  But they've got to be punished so enough of these people can't be induced by the Democrat law firms to do it
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:03.440]  So this is the fight for free speech
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:09.800]  All right, we've got Rick DeSantis and I don't like people when they call in saying who they are
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:15.000]  Because I remember I've had him on as a few guests, but I can't remember, you know voices perfectly so it becomes an issue
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.560]  with
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:22.280]  People calling in saying there's someone and then that becomes a liability for us
[01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:28.840]  And I'm not saying Rick's doing that. It probably is Rick a 9-11 survivor has been on the show before but just as a rule for the producers
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:31.320]  It's fine to have people on his guest
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:36.280]  We just can't say their guest if we haven't contacted them through their known handle and certified them
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:41.040]  It's kind of like the blue check on Twitter and it's kind of a moment cuz I
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:45.760]  See that on the screen and you don't really know it's like saying Alex Jones is calling in
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:48.840]  But we'll go to him and get his take on Syria here right now
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:53.520]  So someone's saying he's Rick DeSantis is called in go ahead Rick
[01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:57.320]  Alex I apologize it is Rick DeSantis
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.880]  No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm just teaching the producer something. You're not you're not you're awesome. It doesn't matter
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:06.520]  I'm just people get pissed when I don't let them call in and say who they are without proof. Go ahead
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:11.760]  Well, I'm calling not because of who I am I'm calling because of an American citizen one
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:16.840]  Let me say thank you to you. You've been out front taking the hits whether it was 9 11
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:21.360]  It was Oklahoma. You're here now with the issue of Syria, and I'm gonna make this quick
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:29.520]  I've sacrificed as many as tens of thousands have with regards to never 9 11 never getting help never asking for anything
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:34.920]  We've been suffering with our illnesses. We're still dying now. We're back here with Syria again, okay?
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:39.640]  I'm gonna just say this and I'm gonna ask the world to do it
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:45.320]  I'm demanded that brought in their Putin president Putin get to the US and
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:48.880]  President Trump get there too with them and
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:54.060]  Problem give a press conference, and I am challenging president Putin
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:59.680]  To put it on the table and make it clear there was no collusion with president Trump
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:05.680]  No collusion with his campaign that the collusion existed with the play in the Obama administration
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:10.300]  administration the McCain's the grand uranium one and
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:16.240]  Because it'll take their legs out. It'll neutralize everything and by the way Rick
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:20.040]  You can go I met you in person. You've been on many times. You haven't been on probably six seven years
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:25.320]  I recognize your voice you've hung out in New York and stuff. God bless you and what you're saying is what I should have
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:32.040]  Started the broadcast with it's time for Putin to come to the US to check and out two months before a week before whatever
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:34.400]  challenge Trump to come there
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:37.940]  To meet with him. He should have already met with him. He should have been the second or third leader
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:40.040]  He met with
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:43.160]  And it's just completely outrageous that almost a year and a half later
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:50.000]  He hasn't met with them and just get this out in the open and absolutely roll back the neocons the deep state and all the rest
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.400]  Of them by getting out front of it not proving how you know cool
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:58.600]  We are with the CIA director bragging about we've killed hundreds of Russians who congressional panel today
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:01.200]  This is the stuff that World War three is made of
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:05.880]  Yes, yes, and that disgusts me and these are cowards
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:13.520]  These aren't men making peace is harder than making war and we've been true enough and I'm tired of it
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:18.920]  I'm tired of the sacrifices and I'm very blessed to have a good congressman. You've had him on he's great
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:23.360]  And he's the real deal. I can tell you that straight up. Okay, and I'm tired of this
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:25.880]  You've got to be tired. I don't know how you keep doing it
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:31.360]  But are you talking about gates doing it about gates? Yes. Yes. He is spot on
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:36.600]  He's the real deal and they're coming at him to make no mistake. They're coming at all of us
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:42.560]  I utilize my email with your stuff. I get it out everywhere. I'm on the phone as you know
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:50.000]  This petition just went forward with the grand jury. I utilize I listen to you on my phone my tablet my laptop
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.480]  That's why they're so angry Rick is they can't stop people sharing this by hand by word of mouth
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:57:02.880]  So now they're moving to the last phase after putting us in the internet ghetto trying to shut down news wars calm and info wars calm and prison
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:05.760]  Planet calm, but if you stand with us, we will stand together
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:11.240]  We will win God bless your wreck and I'm glad that Rick called in I was just as a rule sometimes folks call in and say
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:14.200]  Hey, it's such and such. It could be somebody spoofing you
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:19.480]  Then they say I did that then I get sued and it would be thrown out
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:26.400]  But it's the same deal over and over and over again as they try to shut us down to true mark of honor

[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:01.480]  Encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:07.840]  And as a long-time info wars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:11.760]  Anthroplex my girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex. Thank you

[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:28.000]  I can't wait to get some more and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:33.920]  Absolutely, we because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:40.920]  Understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:42.920]  We can take our country back
[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:54.280]  Info wars life brain force plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:55.760]  Going back about five years ago
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:59:01.560]  We did research on what top selling new tropics were what were most popular what were best what people liked and we made it
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:07.680]  Even stronger then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup
[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:14.040]  We only have a hundred and fifty percent and then it helps funder operation. Well, now it's fifty percent off
[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:17.320]  That means we've got a twenty five percent markup
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:24.560]  And we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in brain force takes about thirty minutes
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:30.940]  But the two go together. It's the mind and body challenge. They're both fifty percent off individually or
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:37.540]  Or together they're fifty percent off and free shipping with the combo and info horse live calm
[01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:42.580]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers are about to sell out
[01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:47.340]  Info horse live calm to get your brain force plus and real red pill today
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:57.860]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[01:59:57.860 --> 02:00:11.780]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info
[02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:26.780]  We're now into hour number three and that means we are
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:33.540]  One two three four five five hours of the global transmission have a lapse David Knight kicked it off at 8 a.m.
[02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:36.980]  This morning I was shroyers coming up and we've got a huge list in fact
[02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:40.100]  You guys print me a list of the folks that are coming up during the
[02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:47.900]  34-hour historic stop world war three with Russia broadcast was going to be stop the collapse of America stop the removal of Trump
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:53.860]  But that just kicked into this whole other gear and there's so much. I'm going to be covering
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:59.980]  I'll continue with your calls mark Faber. You're just joining us for I think one or two segments on the economy and his take on war and all
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:01.980]  The rest of it
[02:01:03.380 --> 02:01:08.020]  But right now let's go back to your phone calls right now. Let's talk to John in New York
[02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:10.660]  Thanks for holding sir. You're on the air
[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:14.020]  Hey Alex. How are you? I'm all right my friend?
[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:16.700]  real quick
[02:01:16.740 --> 02:01:22.140]  One thing if people don't talk about is that Assad not only enjoying so much recent success
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:26.700]  But the fact that his stock market was up about 200 percent
[02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:29.460]  Since Trump came into office
[02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:34.980]  That's the best performing stock market in the world his currency was up 30 percent
[02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:41.940]  He had everything in his hand and then Trump says we're leaving and all of a sudden you get another attack
[02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:48.900]  So there are people obviously there that want us back and they want us to hit him hard, but it's about type 1
[02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:51.140]  Not about anything else
[02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:54.060]  You take a look at the map right now of
[02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:59.540]  Eurasia and you take a look at Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States and Qatar
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:02.100]  They have an enormous amount of natural gas
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:09.180]  Now costs twice as much to deliver natural gas by tankers liquefied natural gas
[02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:11.660]  About six and a half dollars
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:13.820]  Million cubic feet. All right, you listen
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:20.180]  The other thing is most important is Russia their main export is natural gas going into Europe
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:24.060]  It's about two dollars and ninety cents million cubic feet
[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:29.300]  What we're trying to do if I'm correct is we're trying to kill Russia
[02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:36.180]  Economically just like what happened with them in the 80s with the Afghan war while they're trying to build a pipeline there
[02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:40.020]  Now what happened with Bill Casey and Ralph Reagan in the 80s?
[02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:47.060]  They developed the futures exchange for oil contracts in 1983 you can look it up
[02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:50.940]  The book called the oil card, which is very important. Everybody should read it
[02:02:51.180 --> 02:02:55.740]  This is the economic warfare that nobody talks about and Bill Casey from the CIA
[02:02:55.740 --> 02:03:02.220]  They worked on developing Chicago market for exchange oil futures for oil and at that point
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:08.720]  There was a 17-year bear market oil. It destroyed Russia. This is the same back story
[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:11.300]  Nobody's talking about Iran
[02:03:11.860 --> 02:03:18.460]  Russia their energy or Saudi Arabia Qatar their energy going into Europe. We're just trying to block them
[02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:22.500]  We also have an enormous amount of liquefied natural gas. We're developing
[02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:26.700]  Russia's in a lot of trouble and that's right Russia stock market
[02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:30.820]  We can pull that up Russia stock market is crashed this week just type in Russia stock market crash
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:36.740]  And click news you can see their stuff straight down and that's economic warfare. We've got troops on their border
[02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:42.340]  They're trying to fight radical Islam. I'm a free market guy. I don't think you should stop those pipelines going through
[02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:46.820]  Just like I don't think China should be able to go take over the South China Sea and
[02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:52.020]  And declare they own and run everything as well. That is wrong
[02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:56.140]  I am a free market guy and this is globalism and when the Chinese do it
[02:03:56.140 --> 02:03:59.380]  It's wrong and when America does it's wrong and Trump claims, you know
[02:03:59.380 --> 02:04:04.420]  He's this free market guy that wants competition at a lower prices for everybody. Let's do it. Let's let
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:10.140]  Let's let you know those pipelines bring Syrian gas into Europe
[02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:13.620]  That's how you're going to build up their profit and make them a first-world nation
[02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:17.660]  Instead now I understand the little piggies in Saudi Arabia and the globalists
[02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:23.660]  They've got to be the only ones that can ship it in and and they don't want to ship it by the super tanker into there
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:31.880]  Yeah, well the bottom line is this is the basically the story in the theme that nobody wants to talk about or wants to be on
[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:35.940]  TV talking about because that I think is what really is going on
[02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:41.740]  You know, the fact is just look up that book the oil Carter's an unbelievable book by a guy
[02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:46.300]  I forgot his name James Norman. Well, sir, what you're saying is I've read the books
[02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:52.540]  We've been covering this for seven years. You are 1,000% correct Afghanistan is about that as well and rare earth minerals
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:54.540]  We'll be back with more calls. Thank you, John
[02:04:56.380 --> 02:05:03.220]  Introducing cell force by info wars life cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection
[02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:08.900]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy. They are your body's cellular engines
[02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:16.180]  Cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria much like a cellular engine overhaul
[02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:22.900]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species
[02:05:23.260 --> 02:05:27.860]  top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage
[02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:30.700]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species
[02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:37.540]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market the stronger the
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:43.780]  Antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals
[02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:48.820]  Boost protect and adapt with cell force from info wars life

[02:05:57.740 --> 02:06:01.100]  Wars come to mind Alex Jones Alex Jones
[02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:04.260]  But there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones
[02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:08.820]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign
[02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:15.540]  But changing his algorithm to marry stories like the Clinton body count story. That's according to website info wars
[02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:19.500]  It's probably confirmed our recent shooters with fully automatic weapons
[02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:25.020]  After Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee
[02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:28.340]  JFK was shot from the back and the front
[02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:30.820]  It was almost a distiller of planned infusions
[02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:32.980]  It's just pancake
[02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:34.980]  It took the babies out of incubators
[02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:36.980]  Not the children, but I have a cool thought
[02:06:36.980 --> 02:06:39.980]  I think this is a national security imperative
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:46.980]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they were operating in areas that we can't control
[02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:47.980]  USA
[02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:52.980]  Is this global governance at last? Is it one world the central bank has been charged?
[02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:54.980]  Israel claims the effect was accidental
[02:06:54.980 --> 02:06:57.980]  Some former U.S. naval officers say it was on purpose
[02:06:57.980 --> 02:07:01.980]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up
[02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:06.980]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow
[02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:08.980]  Russian, stop
[02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:10.980]  Denied everything. He called it all fake news
[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:13.980]  And he accused CNN of being fake news
[02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:15.980]  This is a national emergency
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:17.980]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump
[02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:21.980]  It will cause a massive civil war in this country
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:23.980]  This is a female high-level emergency
[02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:27.980]  You are at war with Russia
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:32.980]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange
[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:36.980]  The White House and the president are citing info wars
[02:07:36.980 --> 02:07:38.980]  They can shut us down, you're next
[02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:43.980]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[02:07:43.980 --> 02:07:46.980]  It's Alex Jones
[02:07:48.980 --> 02:07:55.980]  Alright, for the next two segments, the world-famous Dr. Mark Fiber of the big global report
[02:07:55.980 --> 02:07:58.980]  Boom Boom Boom is going to be joining us
[02:07:58.980 --> 02:08:01.980]  I wanted to get him on a few weeks ago to talk about the world economy
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:05.980]  Russia, Syria, all the things that are happening there
[02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:07.980]  We're going to get his take as a smart cookie on that
[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:09.980]  At the bottom of the hour, he'll be gone
[02:08:09.980 --> 02:08:13.980]  And we'll go right to your phone calls
[02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:16.980]  He is the editor and publisher of the Boom Boom and Boom report
[02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:18.980]  Born in Zurich, Switzerland, went to school in Geneva
[02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:20.980]  I'm not going to go over his whole background
[02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:25.980]  He's successful, he's been with all the different investment newsletters and advice
[02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:29.980]  He's given all the different companies and investment things that he's headed up
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:32.980]  Tamar's Gold, Asia's Age of Discovery
[02:08:32.980 --> 02:08:34.980]  And again, Chartered Gold's Rise and all the rest of it
[02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:36.980]  And the number one bestseller
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:38.980]  A regular speaker at various investment seminars
[02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:41.980]  Dr. Fiber is well known for his contrarian investment approach
[02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:43.980]  He's also associated with a variety of funds
[02:08:43.980 --> 02:08:46.980]  Just remember the board of directors of numerous companies
[02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:49.980]  Again, gloomboomdoom.com
[02:08:49.980 --> 02:08:53.980]  I want to get into this whole geopolitical system
[02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:56.980]  And why the West is attacking Russia
[02:08:56.980 --> 02:08:58.980]  I'm not a Russophile, never been to Russia
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:00.980]  I have gotten my visa
[02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:02.980]  I tweeted it out a few months ago as a joke
[02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:04.980]  The media uses that as an example
[02:09:04.980 --> 02:09:06.980]  That I'm a Russian spy and then says
[02:09:06.980 --> 02:09:08.980]  Jones says he hadn't been to Russia, but here's his visa
[02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:10.980]  Yeah, it's not stamped morons
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:13.980]  But going to Russia doesn't make you a Russian agent
[02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:15.980]  Any more than having Mark Fiber on
[02:09:15.980 --> 02:09:17.980]  Or going to Switzerland makes you swish
[02:09:17.980 --> 02:09:20.980]  Now that might be somewhere I actually would move
[02:09:20.980 --> 02:09:23.980]  But anyways, Mark Fiber is here with us
[02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:25.980]  I could be a Swissophile
[02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:27.980]  A whole William Tell and their ethos
[02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:29.980]  Is what actually America picked up
[02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:31.980]  More than anything, is the Swiss ethos
[02:09:31.980 --> 02:09:33.980]  Became 1776, that's a little known fact
[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:35.980]  But the founders talked about that
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:37.980]  They had the second amendment before we did
[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:39.980]  But I'm digressing!
[02:09:39.980 --> 02:09:41.980]  Mark Fiber joins us, Mark
[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:43.980]  Wow, what a crazy time to be alive
[02:09:43.980 --> 02:09:45.980]  With the neocons on the left
[02:09:45.980 --> 02:09:47.980]  There are around 70 targets including Russians
[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:49.980]  Who are trying to pull out of Syria
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:51.980]  Why in the world will we do that?
[02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:57.980]  Well, different people have obviously
[02:09:57.980 --> 02:09:59.980]  Different views
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:01.980]  And I think that America must
[02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:03.980]  Get used to the fact
[02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:05.980]  That foreign countries
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:07.980]  That have become
[02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:09.980]  Economically very important
[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:13.980]  Have also more geopolitical influence
[02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:15.980]  Than before
[02:10:15.980 --> 02:10:17.980]  And they have
[02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:20.980]  They look at the world from a totally different perspective
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:22.980]  If you're sitting in Beijing
[02:10:22.980 --> 02:10:26.980]  It's of strategic importance for you
[02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:30.980]  To control the South China Sea
[02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:33.980]  The way it is strategically important
[02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:35.980]  For the US
[02:10:35.980 --> 02:10:38.980]  To control basically the Panama Canal
[02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:40.980]  The Caribbean
[02:10:40.980 --> 02:10:43.980]  And have friendly neighbors
[02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:46.980]  Both in Mexico and in Canada
[02:10:46.980 --> 02:10:49.980]  And not to have the Chinese
[02:10:49.980 --> 02:10:52.980]  And Russian bases in these areas
[02:10:52.980 --> 02:10:54.980]  So the perspective of the Chinese
[02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:56.980]  Is very different
[02:10:56.980 --> 02:10:58.980]  The Russian
[02:10:58.980 --> 02:11:00.980]  They have also a very different perspective
[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:03.980]  And I'd like to mention here one point
[02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:05.980]  Mr Putin
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:08.980]  Is a relatively
[02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:10.980]  Tolerant Russian leader
[02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:14.980]  He's not a vicious star
[02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:17.980]  Have characterized Russian history
[02:11:17.980 --> 02:11:19.980]  He's no Stalin
[02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:21.980]  And Stalin
[02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:23.980]  Keep in mind
[02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:25.980]  When you ask Russians
[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:27.980]  Who is the most popular leader
[02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:29.980]  In their history
[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:30.980]  It's Stalin
[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:31.980]  Remarkable
[02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:32.980]  He was seen as a strong man
[02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:33.980]  But I would say in many ways
[02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:34.980]  Hasn't Putin
[02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:36.980]  At least economically, culturally
[02:11:36.980 --> 02:11:38.980]  And in a reformer A, B
[02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:40.980]  Why do the globalists
[02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:42.980]  And the Anglo-American establishment
[02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:45.980]  Fear Putin so much?
[02:11:45.980 --> 02:11:47.980]  Well, they wanted basically
[02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:51.980]  To annex or bring Ukraine
[02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:55.980]  Into the western hegemony
[02:11:55.980 --> 02:11:58.980]  Dominated by NATO and the US
[02:11:58.980 --> 02:12:01.980]  And you have to understand
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:04.980]  Ukraine was a Russian territory
[02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:06.980]  It became Ukraine
[02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:10.980]  At the beginning of the 20th century
[02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:14.980]  But the eastern part of Ukraine
[02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:17.980]  Anything that is east of the Nieper
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:19.980]  That's a river
[02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:22.980]  And that is clearly Russian
[02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:24.980]  And not Ukraine
[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:28.980]  And Poland was also
[02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:32.980]  That didn't exist in the 19th century
[02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:35.980]  It only became into existence very late
[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:38.980]  It was part of Germany
[02:12:38.980 --> 02:12:40.980]  And part of Russia
[02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:43.980]  The Russian border went to Germany
[02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:46.980]  And the Russians were at the time
[02:12:46.980 --> 02:12:49.980]  Yes, exactly as you show it
[02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:54.980]  They were very close to the Europeans
[02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:57.980]  The Russian culture is much more European
[02:12:57.980 --> 02:13:00.980]  Than what people perceive it to be
[02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:02.980]  And let's expand on that
[02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:04.980]  You live right there in Switzerland
[02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:06.980]  People who aren't living there don't
[02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:08.980]  I can read history books
[02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:10.980]  My wife who is smart listens to MPR
[02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:12.980]  She listens to MPR when she is driving
[02:13:12.980 --> 02:13:14.980]  About six months ago
[02:13:14.980 --> 02:13:16.980]  Putin is bad
[02:13:16.980 --> 02:13:18.980]  He invaded Ukraine
[02:13:18.980 --> 02:13:20.980]  And took it from the Ukrainians
[02:13:20.980 --> 02:13:22.980]  Eastern Ukraine has always been part of Russia
[02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:24.980]  Russia was founded in eastern Ukraine
[02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:26.980]  It's always split between Orthodox
[02:13:26.980 --> 02:13:28.980]  Under the Tsarist
[02:13:28.980 --> 02:13:30.980]  And Catholics
[02:13:30.980 --> 02:13:31.980]  Hitler took over Ukraine
[02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:32.980]  And killed a bunch of people
[02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:33.980]  The Russians did too
[02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:36.980]  But Russia was born there
[02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:37.980]  And then she's like, really?
[02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:39.980]  Really, they say Putin invaded
[02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:42.980]  No, Soros overthrew the country
[02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:43.980]  They overthrew an elected government
[02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:44.980]  And we're going to take the whole thing
[02:13:44.980 --> 02:13:46.980]  And the Russians decided
[02:13:46.980 --> 02:13:47.980]  In Russian held areas
[02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:48.980]  To take over their own areas
[02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:50.980]  And then you've got what?
[02:13:50.980 --> 02:13:52.980]  The son of the former vice president
[02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:54.980]  He runs the gas company there
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:55.980]  Joe Biden's son
[02:13:55.980 --> 02:13:57.980]  I mean, the looting in Ukraine is insane
[02:13:57.980 --> 02:14:00.980]  What's the current state of Ukraine?
[02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:02.980]  Well, I mean, economically
[02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:04.980]  They're not doing particularly well
[02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:05.980]  But I have to say
[02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:08.980]  There was a great investment opportunity
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:10.980]  Ukrainian bonds have performed
[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:12.980]  Very well last year
[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:14.980]  And equities as well
[02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:17.980]  So I think we better
[02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:19.980]  Study history
[02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:22.980]  To understand some of the background
[02:14:22.980 --> 02:14:25.980]  Now, the Russians
[02:14:25.980 --> 02:14:27.980]  As I said, Putin is a relative
[02:14:27.980 --> 02:14:29.980]  Moderate leader
[02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:31.980]  But there are other people in Russia
[02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:33.980]  That are less moderate
[02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:35.980]  And he had to intervene
[02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:38.980]  In order not to lose eastern Ukraine
[02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:41.980]  Especially, especially
[02:14:41.980 --> 02:14:45.980]  Because the American wanted to establish
[02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:49.980]  Military bases in Ukraine
[02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:51.980]  And the missile bases
[02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:53.980]  Secondly, if you look at the map
[02:14:53.980 --> 02:14:55.980]  You just showed
[02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:57.980]  It is very clear
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:00.980]  That for the Russian
[02:15:00.980 --> 02:15:04.980]  The Crimea is of paramount importance
[02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:06.980]  Strategically
[02:15:06.980 --> 02:15:10.980]  Because without the Crimean half-island
[02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:13.980]  Basically, they have no access
[02:15:13.980 --> 02:15:15.980]  To the Mediterranean
[02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:18.980]  And that, I guarantee you
[02:15:18.980 --> 02:15:22.980]  They will never give up Crimea
[02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:23.980]  Where Russia was founded
[02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:25.980]  But the average person doesn't know
[02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:27.980]  That Europe basically founded Russia
[02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:29.980]  In its modern sense of the Tsars
[02:15:29.980 --> 02:15:32.980]  That the Tsar was basically
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:34.980]  Genetically identical to the King of England
[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:36.980]  At the very same time
[02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:38.980]  Or that, you know, any of that
[02:15:38.980 --> 02:15:40.980]  They think history is a disease
[02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:42.980]  And an enemy
[02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:44.980]  And even my average fellow American
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:46.980]  Again, knows all the football scores
[02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:48.980]  But nothing about any historical facts
[02:15:48.980 --> 02:15:50.980]  And that is why we are becoming slaves
[02:15:50.980 --> 02:15:52.980]  We'll be back with Mark Fiber to talk
[02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:53.980]  World War 3, The Economy and more

[02:20:41.980 --> 02:20:43.980]  One more segment with Mark Faber
[02:20:43.980 --> 02:20:46.980]  The editor and publisher of the
[02:20:46.980 --> 02:20:48.980]  Gloom Boom Doom Report
[02:20:48.980 --> 02:20:49.980]  GloomBoomDoom.com
[02:20:49.980 --> 02:20:51.980]  I want to get him on about the economy
[02:20:51.980 --> 02:20:57.260]  But now this war stuff happened. There's nothing bigger for the economy obviously than a natural disaster or a war
[02:20:58.140 --> 02:21:02.380]  Trump I'm a big supporter of Trump. I like Trump. I know he's a patriot, but
[02:21:03.340 --> 02:21:08.060]  Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria at their bases how dare them
[02:21:08.220 --> 02:21:11.620]  I'm gonna punch you in the teeth if you put your hands up. I'm gonna break your neck
[02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:16.060]  Get ready Russia because they will be coming nice and new and smart
[02:21:16.060 --> 02:21:21.980]  You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it
[02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:25.820]  All three of the previous attacks have been confirmed by the Pentagon and the UN
[02:21:26.300 --> 02:21:30.820]  That were launched by the rebels this fourth now the Russians say was launched by the rebels again
[02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:35.580]  Secretary defense comes out today and says yeah, we don't have evidence Russia did it that should be big news
[02:21:35.580 --> 02:21:40.300]  But instead David Knight just got a notification from YouTube and again
[02:21:40.300 --> 02:21:44.300]  We're on bunch of radio and TV stations, but it's like more censorship than we've ever seen today
[02:21:44.300 --> 02:21:51.180]  We're demonetizing your videos and blocking them from this morning the three hours that he did on these very subjects
[02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:55.340]  They don't want you to see the secretary of defense saying we don't have evidence Russia did this
[02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:57.740]  They don't want you to hear the Russian ambassador saying the same thing
[02:21:58.780 --> 02:21:59.740]  No
[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:02.380]  You don't want to hear that there's deep state actors staging false flags
[02:22:02.940 --> 02:22:07.980]  So so they are just blocking us everywhere because we're trying to have an anti-war broadcast
[02:22:08.220 --> 02:22:13.660]  Because there's no evidence rush has done anything mark. Fawber. What is your take on what's happening to trump and the and the pressure?
[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:17.580]  He's under to do this because just yesterday he said he was going to strike them now
[02:22:17.580 --> 02:22:19.980]  He seems to be backing off of that sum. What do you think's happening?
[02:22:21.980 --> 02:22:24.060]  What I mean you have to say
[02:22:24.060 --> 02:22:28.700]  He has surrounded himself by some neocons
[02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:31.740]  Bolton is one of them, of course
[02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:35.820]  And they would like to intervene here and there
[02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:41.020]  But I just like to explain one point that I think is important to understand
[02:22:41.020 --> 02:22:43.020]  Uh
[02:22:43.900 --> 02:22:49.100]  At the beginning of the 20th century in 1905
[02:22:50.780 --> 02:22:52.780]  There was a geo
[02:22:53.420 --> 02:22:56.140]  strategies called Alfred and Fincher
[02:22:57.100 --> 02:22:58.140]  and he
[02:22:58.140 --> 02:23:01.900]  explained uh the difference between the naval power
[02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:03.820]  and
[02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:04.940]  land power
[02:23:04.940 --> 02:23:06.940]  Germany was a land power
[02:23:07.100 --> 02:23:09.100]  Britain was an
[02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:11.100]  um naval power
[02:23:11.580 --> 02:23:13.580]  and he established essentially
[02:23:14.860 --> 02:23:18.940]  The thinking that whoever would control the homeland
[02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:22.220]  Which essentially stretches from Germany
[02:23:22.940 --> 02:23:24.380]  through Russia
[02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:26.380]  Far East Russia and China
[02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:28.700]  Whoever would control that homeland
[02:23:29.500 --> 02:23:31.500]  would essentially control the world
[02:23:32.220 --> 02:23:33.900]  and then
[02:23:33.900 --> 02:23:35.660]  later on
[02:23:35.660 --> 02:23:37.660]  in the u.s. There was uh
[02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:39.660]  a Dutch
[02:23:39.980 --> 02:23:41.980]  American geopolitician
[02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:45.020]  Geo strategist called Nicolaus
[02:23:45.740 --> 02:23:47.180]  Spikeman
[02:23:47.180 --> 02:23:53.340]  And he established the view that you had to control the rimland. In other words, you had to surround
[02:23:54.220 --> 02:23:56.220]  Germany you had to surround
[02:23:56.380 --> 02:23:58.380]  Russia you had to surround
[02:23:58.940 --> 02:24:00.140]  China with
[02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:02.140]  with military bases
[02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:06.300]  And these countries nowadays have become so powerful
[02:24:06.300 --> 02:24:08.300]  for different reasons
[02:24:08.540 --> 02:24:11.340]  That they don't want to be encircled anymore
[02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:13.900]  or cannot tolerate
[02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:19.900]  That's right. And at the end of the cold war when russia agreed to lay down its weapons, basically
[02:24:20.540 --> 02:24:26.620]  The the west agreed to not take over former Soviet bloc countries and then the west violated those agreements. These are just facts
[02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:30.780]  Yes, this is a fact. You're absolutely right
[02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:32.620]  Russia
[02:24:32.620 --> 02:24:34.940]  Did not violate anything
[02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:36.300]  until
[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:38.300]  the western countries
[02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:39.900]  repeatedly
[02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:41.900]  violated the agreement
[02:24:43.020 --> 02:24:45.420]  Well, they're definitely pushing for a new world war. Do you agree?
[02:24:48.300 --> 02:24:50.300]  I'm not sure they
[02:24:50.380 --> 02:24:52.380]  push for a new world war
[02:24:52.540 --> 02:24:56.780]  But you never know with these politicians what they think because the problem is
[02:24:57.340 --> 02:24:59.340]  Uh, this is a generation
[02:24:59.340 --> 02:25:06.540]  Uh, nowadays that hasn't been to war and they haven't seen the horrors of war
[02:25:07.260 --> 02:25:09.260]  People who've been through a war
[02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:15.100]  They don't want the war anymore because it's a it's a horrible undertaking
[02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:20.940]  But the people that take the decisions about the wars are not the ones that go and fight
[02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:24.380]  You understand when alexander the the great
[02:25:24.380 --> 02:25:31.820]  Great conquered the middle east and the parts of india. He led his armies to war. That's right
[02:25:32.140 --> 02:25:34.620]  He was leading one of the divisions
[02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:37.820]  the equestrian
[02:25:37.980 --> 02:25:44.860]  And the other roman emperors most of them also went to war. They didn't sit in Rome and did nothing
[02:25:45.180 --> 02:25:47.180]  That's right. Julius Caesar
[02:25:47.180 --> 02:25:53.660]  Uh, was was just as successful as alexander the great man respects spent what 40 years of his life leading combat would never even in
[02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:54.540]  Rome
[02:25:54.540 --> 02:26:00.460]  Well, so in closing we have this permanent wimp community that constantly wants to attack and start all these wars
[02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:06.780]  The generals are the ones telling them don't start these wars actually. I'm not lionizing the generals, but please continue
[02:26:08.540 --> 02:26:11.820]  I agree with you. They're actually the american generals
[02:26:12.620 --> 02:26:17.660]  They remember the war they've seen also what happened in iraq and in afghanistan
[02:26:17.660 --> 02:26:22.860]  And they know that nowadays a conventional war cannot be won
[02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:31.660]  What can happen is that the country sends some missiles with nuclear weapons and destroys actually a whole country
[02:26:32.540 --> 02:26:39.100]  But that doesn't serve anybody any good because the adversaries will do exactly the same
[02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:40.460]  And let's be clear
[02:26:40.460 --> 02:26:43.900]  Let's say the us let ourselves be nuked or russia vice versa
[02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:49.260]  That would cause a new nuclear winner massive radiation death. Uh, and and it would
[02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:52.780]  Cause a world financial collapse for sure everybody agrees
[02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:58.380]  Well, nobody's gonna just take the hit and most estimates are total loss of life on the surface of the planet
[02:26:58.700 --> 02:27:02.380]  Only cockroaches living and sea creatures around heat vents
[02:27:03.420 --> 02:27:09.660]  Well, I don't know who will be living but I can tell you if we really have
[02:27:09.660 --> 02:27:12.940]  A nuclear war in the world
[02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:20.380]  It's not going to be any fun and the population of the world could shrink quite dramatically
[02:27:20.860 --> 02:27:28.140]  But we can also have a cyber war where you just destroy the internet infrastructure
[02:27:28.620 --> 02:27:31.100]  And then there are no more banking transactions
[02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:34.780]  You could have a biological warfare
[02:27:35.420 --> 02:27:37.420]  Where you poison a population
[02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:40.780]  And so forth there's lots of possibilities nowadays
[02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:46.220]  And the best in my view would be to kind of compromise
[02:27:48.220 --> 02:27:51.980]  You know, I was gonna let you go now, but I'll you go to 40 after only five more minutes on this side of the break
[02:27:51.980 --> 02:27:54.300]  Since you raised this because you really are a great historian
[02:27:54.700 --> 02:27:57.980]  I personally read quite a few history books, but you know here in your depth and knowledge
[02:27:57.980 --> 02:28:02.860]  I know it surpasses mine a long way and I want to get into what keeps you awake most at night
[02:28:02.860 --> 02:28:09.740]  That's negative, but also what keeps you most excited about positive things mark faber doctor mark faber is our guest of
[02:28:10.220 --> 02:28:13.900]  gloom boom doom calm, but I also want to ask you when we come back
[02:28:14.780 --> 02:28:16.780]  about
[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:19.100]  Pulling back from this
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:22.140]  If we didn't have governments that we're always trying to dominate the other government
[02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:28.060]  What your idea for humanity to have a continuing expanding economy and a future

[02:33:50.220 --> 02:33:53.820]  But Pompeo is saying, we've already killed hundreds of Russians in Syria.
[02:33:53.820 --> 02:33:56.500]  In a congressional testimony, let's find that video.
[02:33:56.500 --> 02:33:57.980]  I know Kit ran in and gave me this article.
[02:33:57.980 --> 02:33:59.220]  I guess the video is there.
[02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:00.220]  Let's get that.
[02:34:00.220 --> 02:34:05.540]  So what I'm saying is this, globalism is governmental and corporate interests that
[02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:09.980]  don't want free market, that try to create combines so big that they create a monopoly
[02:34:09.980 --> 02:34:11.540]  capitalist system in their own words.
[02:34:11.540 --> 02:34:16.740]  And they have a technological computer system and technocracy used to control everybody
[02:34:16.740 --> 02:34:19.580]  in their own words.
[02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:23.460]  And then they authoritarianly run around trying to take everybody else over in the world,
[02:34:23.460 --> 02:34:26.980]  lecturing those of us that don't want to start fights with Russia and others that we're
[02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:33.780]  bad people and then attacking us and lying about us and saying we're racist and shooing
[02:34:33.780 --> 02:34:38.780]  us and all of the sanctions and I know Faber likes China because they're a big engine and
[02:34:38.780 --> 02:34:43.700]  I know they get a bad shake sometimes, but come on, China sells political distance organs.
[02:34:43.700 --> 02:34:45.980]  They're taking over the South China Sea.
[02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:49.940]  If you want to see an authoritarianism, it's allied with the American left with globalists.
[02:34:49.940 --> 02:34:52.260]  I see China as part of the globalist combine.
[02:34:52.260 --> 02:34:59.700]  I see America, what's left of it, Russia, the Brexit and other nationalist movements,
[02:34:59.700 --> 02:35:01.860]  what's happening with Victor Orban in Hungary.
[02:35:01.860 --> 02:35:05.620]  I see that as the resistance and where the free market ideas are coming from.
[02:35:05.620 --> 02:35:10.700]  So I kind of see the power constellation maybe different than Dr. Faber, the smart guy does,
[02:35:10.700 --> 02:35:16.940]  but fundamentally, when we're up here competing with each other in the US media about who
[02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:20.460]  hates Russians more, it's sick.
[02:35:20.460 --> 02:35:24.260]  And it's a globalist anger, they don't have that incredibly resource-filled, biggest nation
[02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:27.580]  geographically in the world, and that they can't dominate it.
[02:35:27.580 --> 02:35:31.260]  And it shows how history just keeps repeating, whether it's Russia or Afghanistan over and
[02:35:31.260 --> 02:35:32.260]  over and over again.
[02:35:32.260 --> 02:35:39.100]  So I wanted to ask Dr. Faber in closing, what does he quantify globalism is and its whole
[02:35:39.100 --> 02:35:40.100]  structure?
[02:35:40.100 --> 02:35:42.700]  How do we get out of it and what system replaces it?
[02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:48.180]  Because it's gobbled up like a giant squid, what was left of our free market system, stolen
[02:35:48.180 --> 02:35:53.140]  European and American and Chinese industry to power its greedy takeover.
[02:35:53.140 --> 02:35:54.940]  It's the true authoritarianism.
[02:35:54.940 --> 02:35:57.940]  And so how do you deal with it, identifying it, breaking with it?
[02:35:57.940 --> 02:35:58.940]  What do we do?
[02:35:58.940 --> 02:36:02.340]  Or do you disagree with my breakdown of the constellation of this monster?
[02:36:02.340 --> 02:36:06.180]  Well, I don't disagree with you.
[02:36:06.180 --> 02:36:14.060]  And I'm not saying that the Chinese are in any way perfect, but I want you to also understand
[02:36:14.060 --> 02:36:19.140]  in the Chinese tradition, they never had a democracy.
[02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:23.060]  We never had democracies in the whole of Asia.
[02:36:23.060 --> 02:36:31.420]  We had in China an emperor, and China was not a country like you would think of a country.
[02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:36.900]  It was the middle kingdom between the earth and heaven.
[02:36:36.900 --> 02:36:45.380]  It's totally different concepts of the worldly picture than we Westerners have.
[02:36:45.380 --> 02:36:51.900]  And so we have to understand that for them, Xi Jinping is not an evil leader.
[02:36:51.900 --> 02:36:58.460]  He may become an evil leader, but so far the economy has been expanding.
[02:36:58.460 --> 02:37:06.140]  The Chinese and the Russians both in their history never had it this good.
[02:37:06.140 --> 02:37:14.140]  So they accept, yeah, there are some mistakes in terms of human rights.
[02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:18.420]  But worldwide, there are things that happen that are not correct.
[02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:25.740]  The U.S. has intervened in foreign elections for the last hundred years, but repeatedly.
[02:37:25.740 --> 02:37:31.140]  And then when one country intervenes and intervenes in a way that...
[02:37:31.140 --> 02:37:32.140]  Sure.
[02:37:32.140 --> 02:37:37.940]  What I'm saying is, we obviously have a unipolar world, not one system.
[02:37:37.940 --> 02:37:38.940]  That's a fact.
[02:37:38.940 --> 02:37:39.940]  But where is it going?
[02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:42.940]  I mean, what system can capture the hearts and minds of people?
[02:37:42.940 --> 02:37:48.860]  I say 1776, the ideas of Americana, the Swiss ideas, the ideas of the English, the Magna
[02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:49.860]  Carter, the Dutch.
[02:37:49.860 --> 02:37:54.820]  I mean, how do we get a new renaissance, a new renaissance to take us to the stars?
[02:37:54.820 --> 02:38:03.340]  So I believe that eventually people will rebel against governments, because governments
[02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:09.500]  have become much too big as a percent of the economy, much too powerful.
[02:38:09.500 --> 02:38:17.660]  And the governments nowadays, in most cases, exceptions like Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark,
[02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:23.140]  Switzerland, but in most other countries, the government actually doesn't represent the
[02:38:23.140 --> 02:38:28.260]  interest of the people, but represents its own interest.
[02:38:28.260 --> 02:38:31.460]  And that will lead to a revolution one day.
[02:38:31.460 --> 02:38:38.780]  In my opinion, it may end up before we are that far with the end of democracies.
[02:38:38.780 --> 02:38:44.900]  I don't think democracies will survive for the simple reason that for the last 5,000
[02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:47.420]  years, we never had democracies.
[02:38:47.420 --> 02:38:54.420]  Now suddenly, for the last 100 years, we had democracies, full democracies, but it's
[02:38:54.420 --> 02:38:56.340]  not a tested system.
[02:38:56.340 --> 02:38:57.820]  I think they will all fail.
[02:38:57.820 --> 02:39:00.660]  Well, I mean, I agree with you, and that's what the demarcation line I'm going to put
[02:39:00.660 --> 02:39:02.900]  here is a third way in there.
[02:39:02.900 --> 02:39:07.620]  We're a republic, not like the Soviet Union calls themselves a republic or North Korea
[02:39:07.620 --> 02:39:10.700]  does, but a real republic with a republican form of government.
[02:39:10.700 --> 02:39:15.300]  For Democrats, it doesn't mean it's a republican party, it means republican and a separation
[02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:19.060]  of powers and the states and the federal government and the three branches and all
[02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:20.780]  the rest of it.
[02:39:20.780 --> 02:39:24.100]  And that system has delivered more prosperity and more freedom.
[02:39:24.100 --> 02:39:31.020]  It has been pure democratization that allows 51% to make the other 49% slaves and has created
[02:39:31.020 --> 02:39:40.460]  another form of tyranny, mob tyranny, programmed by the master architects, the maestros, the
[02:39:40.460 --> 02:39:44.260]  conductors, George Soros, the Clintons, the globalists and others.
[02:39:44.260 --> 02:39:48.140]  So they programmed the mob to then vote the rest of us into slavery and them as well.
[02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:52.300]  So I agree, that form of democracy is a great tyranny, the howling mob that Jefferson warned
[02:39:52.300 --> 02:39:54.180]  of, we have to guard against it.
[02:39:54.180 --> 02:39:59.820]  But to have a real free market system, I call it 1776 worldwide, I see that with Victor
[02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:04.980]  Orban and others, again from Brazil, whether they're leading candidates like a patriot.
[02:40:04.980 --> 02:40:08.980]  All over I see Ron Paul type people, Nigel Farage is on fire.
[02:40:08.980 --> 02:40:15.220]  I see that as the real answer and that third way, not strong men that divvy it all out
[02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:20.060]  or you know, not pure howling mob democracies that are probably worse a lot of times, but
[02:40:20.060 --> 02:40:25.620]  the true Americana system or with the Swiss system with your cantons and I mean, I'm not
[02:40:25.620 --> 02:40:29.220]  just saying this because you're a guy from Switzerland, you guys are really the fount
[02:40:29.220 --> 02:40:33.500]  of not getting involved with others, being incredibly successful in the process, richest
[02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:37.260]  country in the world per capita, no invasions in 300, 400 years.
[02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:40.700]  I mean, just should we not all go with the Swiss model?
[02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:50.660]  Yes, but my observation is that the Swiss model, which is also to a large extent the
[02:40:50.660 --> 02:40:58.540]  model that the Scandinavians countries have is only appropriate and successful in small
[02:40:58.540 --> 02:41:00.020]  countries.
[02:41:00.020 --> 02:41:06.140]  And I believe in general that it would be better not to have two big countries that
[02:41:06.140 --> 02:41:08.900]  share and let's be honest, let's be honest, homogeneous.
[02:41:08.900 --> 02:41:10.580]  I mean, it's one tribe on average.
[02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:11.580]  It's a culture.
[02:41:11.580 --> 02:41:12.580]  They're bound together.
[02:41:12.580 --> 02:41:16.980]  If outsiders come in and adopt the Swiss way, then they would be successful.
[02:41:16.980 --> 02:41:19.980]  But the left has taught people to reject any successful system.
[02:41:19.980 --> 02:41:26.060]  So the Swiss cannot be a, you know, truly modern quote, mercantile quote, metro system.
[02:41:26.060 --> 02:41:27.220]  They would disintegrate.
[02:41:27.220 --> 02:41:36.100]  Well, I think one of the key differences of Switzerland compared to other European countries
[02:41:36.100 --> 02:41:40.340]  has been, we never had any colonies.
[02:41:40.340 --> 02:41:48.100]  We didn't do any, always the right thing that I admit, but we never had any colonies.
[02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:50.940]  And you're landlocked.
[02:41:50.940 --> 02:41:51.940]  We are landlocked.
[02:41:51.940 --> 02:41:54.780]  And you've got aggressive empires all around you.
[02:41:54.780 --> 02:41:59.420]  Well, relatively aggressive, not in the South.
[02:41:59.420 --> 02:42:00.420]  They are no longer.
[02:42:00.420 --> 02:42:01.420]  Yeah, not the Italians.
[02:42:01.420 --> 02:42:02.420]  They're French.
[02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:03.420]  Yeah.
[02:42:03.420 --> 02:42:10.020]  But they, the Germans were quite aggressive, but during World War II, there was just an
[02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:17.660]  article recently in the paper in Switzerland, Hitler had no intention whatsoever to attack
[02:42:17.660 --> 02:42:24.940]  Switzerland because he knew the Swiss are very stubborn and difficult to deal with.
[02:42:24.940 --> 02:42:30.980]  And it would have been very costly to conquer Switzerland for no reward whatsoever.
[02:42:30.980 --> 02:42:33.100]  God bless you, my friend, Dr. Mark Fauber.
[02:42:33.100 --> 02:42:37.380]  That is the essence of freedom is being hardworking, smart, but stubborn and not rolling over like
[02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:38.380]  the Second Amendment.
[02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:39.380]  Never give it up.
[02:42:39.380 --> 02:42:40.380]  The First Amendment.
[02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:41.380]  Never give it up.
[02:42:41.380 --> 02:42:42.380]  They're trying to crush our will.
[02:42:42.380 --> 02:42:43.380]  It's only made us stronger.
[02:42:43.380 --> 02:42:44.380]  Mark Fauber, you're amazing.
[02:42:44.380 --> 02:42:45.380]  Gloom, boom, doom.com.
[02:42:45.380 --> 02:42:46.380]  Amazing website.
[02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:47.380]  Please join us again soon.
[02:42:47.380 --> 02:42:48.380]  Thank you very much.
[02:42:48.380 --> 02:42:49.380]  That's a smart guy.
[02:42:49.380 --> 02:42:52.380]  I'm going to go over and make a documentary in Switzerland.
[02:42:52.380 --> 02:42:53.380]  They got it all figured out.
[02:42:53.380 --> 02:42:54.380]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:54.380 --> 02:42:55.380]  Stay with us.
[02:42:55.380 --> 02:42:59.380]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[02:42:59.380 --> 02:43:00.380]  Debit in Florida.
[02:43:00.380 --> 02:43:01.380]  You're on the air.
[02:43:01.380 --> 02:43:03.380]  Great.
[02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:04.380]  Hey, thank you so much.
[02:43:04.380 --> 02:43:07.380]  Listen, I have bought your product and I got to say they're amazing.
[02:43:07.380 --> 02:43:08.380]  Thank you.
[02:43:08.380 --> 02:43:13.380]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got caveman, superman of vitality, secret
[02:43:13.380 --> 02:43:15.660]  swell, vitamin and infusion.
[02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:17.180]  I've got the body armor.
[02:43:17.180 --> 02:43:18.180]  Wow, thank you.
[02:43:18.180 --> 02:43:20.500]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[02:43:20.500 --> 02:43:22.180]  Which pharmaceuticals do you like best?
[02:43:22.180 --> 02:43:25.620]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest.
[02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:26.620]  That's amazing.
[02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:27.620]  That's really incredible.
[02:43:27.620 --> 02:43:30.140]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:31.460]  I haven't felt sweet.
[02:43:31.460 --> 02:43:37.580]  My morning was fantastic and I love the guys, I love the info wars through and I just want
[02:43:37.580 --> 02:43:42.140]  to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence
[02:43:42.140 --> 02:43:43.140]  just buy it.
[02:43:43.140 --> 02:43:44.140]  We'll love it.
[02:43:44.140 --> 02:43:45.140]  I'm telling you.
[02:43:45.140 --> 02:43:46.140]  I've never bought a bad product.
[02:43:46.140 --> 02:43:50.980]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[02:43:50.980 --> 02:43:55.500]  It's a win-win infowarslife.com.
[02:43:55.500 --> 02:43:59.260]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[02:43:59.260 --> 02:44:03.420]  We went out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy
[02:44:03.420 --> 02:44:09.140]  for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it, and we created a stronger formula
[02:44:09.140 --> 02:44:11.060]  than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[02:44:11.060 --> 02:44:12.060]  It's very simple.
[02:44:12.060 --> 02:44:14.900]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best, we'll just put even more
[02:44:14.900 --> 02:44:16.300]  product in, we'll make it better.
[02:44:16.300 --> 02:44:21.700]  Leading competitors, put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60, we put $10 in it, and sell
[02:44:21.700 --> 02:44:22.700]  it for $30.
[02:44:22.700 --> 02:44:24.900]  It's $19.95 right now.
[02:44:24.900 --> 02:44:29.500]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new tropic for $19.95.
[02:44:29.500 --> 02:44:32.380]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[02:44:32.380 --> 02:44:35.900]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the global threat
[02:44:35.900 --> 02:44:36.900]  of it.
[02:44:36.900 --> 02:44:39.900]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:44.100]  I want to shell it all out before the big supply comes in, and I want people that haven't

[02:46:00.740 --> 02:46:07.500]  cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[02:46:07.500 --> 02:46:13.460]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, carnivore, for being able to break down meat
[02:46:13.460 --> 02:46:19.940]  other proteins better, and then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic
[02:46:19.940 --> 02:46:25.340]  culture of the very best strains in fluorolive advanced restoration.
[02:46:25.340 --> 02:46:30.900]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable fluorolive everyday maintenance, but all of
[02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:39.260]  these are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely
[02:46:39.260 --> 02:46:40.780]  affordable price.
[02:46:40.780 --> 02:46:46.540]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:51.780]  When you purchase it at infowarslive.com you know you are also financing the attack on
[02:46:51.780 --> 02:46:59.860]  the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[02:46:59.860 --> 02:47:15.900]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:22.940]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:22.940 --> 02:47:27.500]  Steve, James, James and others have won your calls here in about two minutes.
[02:47:27.500 --> 02:47:30.300]  I'm going to host a little bit into the next hour, Anthony Kumi is hosting.
[02:47:30.300 --> 02:47:34.220]  I'm going to get into some of this Mueller stuff first, I haven't had time to get to.
[02:47:34.220 --> 02:47:35.220]  It's incredible, obviously.
[02:47:35.220 --> 02:47:40.780]  And we've also got Ryan, maybe forced to leave speakership by summer at all these neocons
[02:47:40.780 --> 02:47:44.380]  and establishment guys being kicked out, but they're kind of now leaving even earlier.
[02:47:44.380 --> 02:47:49.140]  Well, since we're going to be thrown out, we'll just leave now so Democrats can get
[02:47:49.140 --> 02:47:50.140]  a majority.
[02:47:50.140 --> 02:47:54.180]  There's a Republican party sabotage going on right now of Trump.
[02:47:54.180 --> 02:47:58.780]  That's how we've got to be maximally involved right now, so we're going to go to your calls
[02:47:58.780 --> 02:48:01.780]  in a second, just briefly.
[02:48:01.780 --> 02:48:05.460]  We were going to do a 34-hour broadcast talking about the collapse of America that the globalists
[02:48:05.460 --> 02:48:08.660]  are involved in, but now this whole Russia thing popped up.
[02:48:08.660 --> 02:48:12.900]  If you strike the Russian forces, the Russians say they're going to shoot down the missiles
[02:48:12.900 --> 02:48:16.460]  and shoot down the aircraft and then attack the ships, and the Russians do what they say
[02:48:16.460 --> 02:48:20.540]  they're going to do, then the U.S. will retaliate, then we're in a full war.
[02:48:20.540 --> 02:48:26.660]  This is a big deal, and I see some of the liberal media makes jokes, oh, you think they'll be
[02:48:26.660 --> 02:48:29.580]  a war?
[02:48:29.580 --> 02:48:35.620]  And Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and Google, I've never seen them blocking our articles
[02:48:35.620 --> 02:48:36.620]  and videos.
[02:48:36.620 --> 02:48:40.020]  I was looking at articles we wrote yesterday about the Russians saying it's a false flag
[02:48:40.020 --> 02:48:42.220]  and all the evidence at the U.N.
[02:48:42.220 --> 02:48:49.100]  You can't even search those as of this morning on Google, and they're 93% of web searches,
[02:48:49.100 --> 02:48:53.820]  so they are delisting everything to the point of my own crew when I got in this morning
[02:48:53.820 --> 02:48:56.780]  and goes, yeah, we know it's a false flag, the last three were, and I go, no, no, no,
[02:48:56.780 --> 02:48:59.300]  the Russians say it is, and they have proof.
[02:48:59.300 --> 02:49:00.300]  That's big news.
[02:49:00.300 --> 02:49:01.300]  Anyway, you slice it.
[02:49:01.300 --> 02:49:05.380]  You can hardly even find Trump saying he's not going to strike Syria or looking at not
[02:49:05.380 --> 02:49:07.860]  doing it now, or Mattis.
[02:49:07.860 --> 02:49:15.140]  So they are on right now the crazy people at Google, Twitter, Facebook, trying to block
[02:49:15.140 --> 02:49:20.340]  us doing a really good, you know, five plus hours.
[02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:24.060]  David Knight did three hours, we were about to complete three hours, so almost six hours
[02:49:24.060 --> 02:49:31.100]  here, and you've got Zuckerberg, who's been the king of censoring conservatives and libertarians
[02:49:31.100 --> 02:49:35.500]  and having Facebook work for Clinton and openly admitting it, and then less than 1% of Facebook
[02:49:35.500 --> 02:49:40.340]  promoted Trump, because that's all he would let, and they have all these hearings bipartisanly
[02:49:40.340 --> 02:49:43.620]  about how we got to block conservatives from the Internet.
[02:49:43.620 --> 02:49:48.940]  Now it's all Russians, and by the way, I haven't talked about this yet, because I was busy
[02:49:48.940 --> 02:49:53.180]  on Tuesday and Wednesday when he was testifying, but I watched some of it.
[02:49:53.180 --> 02:49:54.820]  He looked like a crazy robot.
[02:49:54.820 --> 02:50:01.060]  We were seeing the real Zuckerberg that calls his supporters dumb aphors.
[02:50:01.060 --> 02:50:04.500]  When he was talking to him, he would do this right here, here, here, cut to me, I'll show
[02:50:04.500 --> 02:50:05.940]  you some of the shots I saw on TV.
[02:50:05.940 --> 02:50:10.940]  Those are, those are kind of bad, but a lot of them are like, I mean, I can't even do
[02:50:10.940 --> 02:50:11.940]  it like him.
[02:50:11.940 --> 02:50:14.900]  It's so unreal.
[02:50:14.900 --> 02:50:17.900]  I mean, just, wow, you're really seeing who this guy is.
[02:50:17.900 --> 02:50:19.940]  Now, look how psychotic he looks.
[02:50:19.940 --> 02:50:26.900]  I mean, that is super, super, super, super, super creepy, man.
[02:50:26.900 --> 02:50:34.020]  And oh my God, I mean, that guy just reeks of robotic.
[02:50:34.020 --> 02:50:35.900]  You see it in British royalty.
[02:50:35.900 --> 02:50:38.700]  It tends to be inbreeding.
[02:50:38.700 --> 02:50:43.340]  And he just has that crazy inbred dog look.
[02:50:43.340 --> 02:50:45.340]  Very, very dangerous.
[02:50:45.340 --> 02:50:47.100]  We're not funded by the globalist.
[02:50:47.100 --> 02:50:48.100]  We're not data mining.
[02:50:48.100 --> 02:50:49.300]  You were funded by you.
[02:50:49.300 --> 02:50:53.740]  And if you will simply go to infowarstore.com and get the very best air filters, still 50,
[02:50:53.740 --> 02:50:54.740]  50 dollars off.
[02:50:54.740 --> 02:50:57.100]  They told me they were going to sell out of them, but now they have another shipment,
[02:50:57.100 --> 02:51:00.540]  but it's, it's got to end the next couple of days, 50% off the Alexa pure breezes that
[02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:04.900]  are eye on four stage filters, many competitors are 400 to $600 to $800.
[02:51:04.900 --> 02:51:05.900]  These are $199.
[02:51:05.900 --> 02:51:11.660]  Normally, they're $149 right now, $50 off, secret 12, great vitamin B 12, the purest
[02:51:11.660 --> 02:51:16.060]  out there as tested by BuzzFeed, even had to admit it, 25% off.
[02:51:16.060 --> 02:51:19.060]  Brain force, our best seller.
[02:51:19.060 --> 02:51:23.020]  That cannot be right because they told me it was selling out Monday, but it's still
[02:51:23.020 --> 02:51:24.020]  50% off.
[02:51:24.020 --> 02:51:25.220]  I guess they just never got rid of that.
[02:51:25.220 --> 02:51:26.980]  That just shows how busy I am with news.
[02:51:26.980 --> 02:51:27.980]  We're asleep at the sweatshirt.
[02:51:27.980 --> 02:51:28.980]  I'm not mad.
[02:51:28.980 --> 02:51:29.980]  It's just insane.
[02:51:29.980 --> 02:51:30.980]  I'm not just saying, this is our last day.
[02:51:30.980 --> 02:51:31.980]  It's our last day.
[02:51:31.980 --> 02:51:32.980]  It's our last day.
[02:51:32.980 --> 02:51:33.980]  It's going to sell out.
[02:51:33.980 --> 02:51:34.980]  We don't get more for months.
[02:51:34.980 --> 02:51:36.580]  It's still 50% off.
[02:51:36.580 --> 02:51:37.580]  Take it down.
[02:51:37.580 --> 02:51:41.860]  I'm not mad, but I'm not up here just saying the sales about to end and then a week later
[02:51:41.860 --> 02:51:45.620]  it's still up there because they told me we had like a week left and more doesn't come
[02:51:45.620 --> 02:51:46.620]  in for over a month.
[02:51:46.620 --> 02:51:49.540]  So we should sell it at the full price to fund the operation.
[02:51:49.540 --> 02:51:52.340]  I'm not mad at the crew.
[02:51:52.340 --> 02:51:56.540]  I just, it's just, we had to end that over the weekend.
[02:51:56.540 --> 02:51:58.180]  I didn't realize it's still up.
[02:51:58.180 --> 02:51:59.180]  It's my fault.
[02:51:59.180 --> 02:52:02.260]  I've been in DC and just all this other insanity.
[02:52:02.260 --> 02:52:05.860]  I got here hours and hours early today to get ready for this broadcast and then I got
[02:52:05.860 --> 02:52:07.980]  hit with a bunch of other stuff, but it doesn't matter.
[02:52:07.980 --> 02:52:08.980]  Whatever.
[02:52:08.980 --> 02:52:10.540]  I'm going to stop complaining.
[02:52:10.540 --> 02:52:14.740]  The big one you need to know is X2 ladies and gentlemen, we may have to come out with
[02:52:14.740 --> 02:52:15.900]  a new one down the road.
[02:52:15.900 --> 02:52:17.300]  I don't know if it's going to be the deep breath crystals.
[02:52:17.300 --> 02:52:21.940]  I don't know if it can get that, but frankly it is the best source.
[02:52:21.940 --> 02:52:28.100]  I believe group, but I've still spent a year trying to come up with my own and groups just
[02:52:28.100 --> 02:52:29.420]  all about people getting good stuff.
[02:52:29.420 --> 02:52:32.700]  He can't find other sources, the price just went up.
[02:52:32.700 --> 02:52:36.980]  They had to get this during gas drilling and oil drilling at between 7 and 12,000 feet.
[02:52:36.980 --> 02:52:41.460]  The companies just don't want to stop to even get it as a distillate, even though it's very
[02:52:41.460 --> 02:52:44.300]  valuable in medicine and so many other things.
[02:52:44.300 --> 02:52:48.580]  The DEA is involved because it's a precursor, not the product we sell you, but we have the
[02:52:48.580 --> 02:52:49.580]  raw iodine.
[02:52:49.580 --> 02:52:53.300]  We're legally allowed to get it industrially and that's being a special holding facility
[02:52:53.300 --> 02:52:58.700]  in a special lab and everything else, but it's just all sorts of dirty tricks because
[02:52:58.700 --> 02:53:03.900]  I get it here to say it's our brain force is now the number one seller because it's
[02:53:03.900 --> 02:53:04.900]  so popular.
[02:53:04.900 --> 02:53:05.900]  This is the second best seller.
[02:53:05.900 --> 02:53:09.780]  There have been a lot of shenanigans trying to stop us having this.
[02:53:09.780 --> 02:53:13.140]  We do have enough for a couple more runs, but those runs cost more money, so the price
[02:53:13.140 --> 02:53:15.580]  has got to go up, but then I don't know.
[02:53:15.580 --> 02:53:18.940]  To the point of we're trying to find a new one.
[02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:19.940]  There you go.
[02:53:19.940 --> 02:53:28.460]  If you want your X-Cube, M4WarsLife.com, M4WarsStore.com, or AAA-253-31-39, it's in the palm oil.
[02:53:28.460 --> 02:53:31.740]  It's injected as a gas into it from deep earth crystals.
[02:53:31.740 --> 02:53:33.700]  The crystals are so pure, we show you in a video.
[02:53:33.700 --> 02:53:38.980]  We put them on the table and they start melting through the table and turning into a purple
[02:53:38.980 --> 02:53:41.980]  gas and shooting up into the air, like I dream of genie.
[02:53:41.980 --> 02:53:44.540]  Actually, here they are getting the crystals out.
[02:53:44.540 --> 02:53:46.060]  I've never even seen this footage.
[02:53:46.060 --> 02:53:47.580]  I've seen the other footage.
[02:53:47.580 --> 02:53:49.540]  We get more and I've seen this footage.
[02:53:49.540 --> 02:53:51.580]  Show it on the table.
[02:53:51.580 --> 02:53:55.780]  That is pure iodine, pure.
[02:53:55.780 --> 02:54:00.740]  No one else has done this, but we had a video where you put it on and it turns into purple
[02:54:00.740 --> 02:54:01.740]  gas.
[02:54:01.740 --> 02:54:06.100]  Yeah, yeah, there it is.
[02:54:06.100 --> 02:54:10.140]  That's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen, and that's why this is so special and so pure.
[02:54:10.140 --> 02:54:11.860]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen.
[02:54:11.860 --> 02:54:16.300]  We also have the immune gargle product that has regular iodine, but it's still good.
[02:54:16.300 --> 02:54:20.100]  It's the clean medical grade type, but it's not the atomic iodine.
[02:54:20.100 --> 02:54:21.100]  Everybody says they have it.
[02:54:21.100 --> 02:54:22.100]  No one has it.
[02:54:22.100 --> 02:54:23.100]  They've tested ours.
[02:54:23.100 --> 02:54:24.780]  They go, oh my God, how did you get pure atomic iodine?
[02:54:24.780 --> 02:54:25.780]  It is pure.
[02:54:25.780 --> 02:54:30.540]  The stuff we've got is the regular iodine, but in the medical grade level, I like to
[02:54:30.540 --> 02:54:34.220]  crap you by it, you know, one of those big drug stores or whatever, and it's in there
[02:54:34.220 --> 02:54:35.500]  with the colloidal silver.
[02:54:35.500 --> 02:54:36.940]  We have it in three different sizes.
[02:54:36.940 --> 02:54:39.540]  That's 50% off as well when you get all three bottles together.
[02:54:39.540 --> 02:54:44.260]  The small one ounce, the three ounce, or what is it, the 16 ounce.
[02:54:44.260 --> 02:54:45.260]  It's all there.
[02:54:45.260 --> 02:54:46.260]  Amazing product.
[02:54:46.260 --> 02:54:47.580]  An immune gargle is a supplement.
[02:54:47.580 --> 02:54:48.580]  You can even swallow it.
[02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:52.060]  You have to first wash your mouth, brush your teeth and take a little swig for you.
[02:54:52.060 --> 02:54:53.060]  Really, really good for you.
[02:54:53.060 --> 02:54:57.620]  It's fullwarslife.com and fullwarsstore.com or triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9, but this could
[02:54:57.620 --> 02:55:02.380]  be, and that we should probably add, this could be your last chance.
[02:55:02.380 --> 02:55:09.020]  It's not your last chance, because we hope to be selling this in 20 years, but that's
[02:55:09.020 --> 02:55:10.020]  what's going on.
[02:55:10.020 --> 02:55:11.860]  I've been put over a barrel, basically.
[02:55:11.860 --> 02:55:12.860]  Not by group.
[02:55:12.860 --> 02:55:13.860]  I've seen the contracts.
[02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:18.860]  They figured out there's a market.
[02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:23.020]  The Deep Earth crystals are only used in pharmaceutical production, because there is a market for
[02:55:23.020 --> 02:55:24.980]  it, but it's the pharmaceutical companies.
[02:55:24.980 --> 02:55:30.500]  They use it as a precursor in a bunch of stuff that they produce, different types of drugs.
[02:55:30.500 --> 02:55:31.500]  This is the good halogen.
[02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:32.500]  Okay, I'm going to stop ranting.
[02:55:32.500 --> 02:55:33.860]  I promise I'm going to your phone calls.
[02:55:33.860 --> 02:55:37.180]  It's just essential folks support the broadcast.
[02:55:37.180 --> 02:55:40.260]  Alpha Power is back in stock, amazing.
[02:55:40.260 --> 02:55:44.700]  We've got Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric, Pharma is 25% off back in stock.
[02:55:44.700 --> 02:55:48.740]  Double Patriot points this month, but it's not 5% of each dollar.
[02:55:48.740 --> 02:55:49.740]  It's 10%.
[02:55:49.740 --> 02:55:54.020]  It's 10% off in your Patriot points, totally free, canceled at any time, sign up for auto
[02:55:54.020 --> 02:55:59.140]  ship additional 20% off or 10% off, so that's 20% total in FullWarStore.com.
[02:55:59.140 --> 02:56:02.100]  But whatever you do, support that local AMRFM station.
[02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:05.340]  Don't take it for granted that you hear us on a local AMRFM station.
[02:56:05.340 --> 02:56:06.340]  Thank the program director.
[02:56:06.340 --> 02:56:07.340]  Thank the owner.
[02:56:07.340 --> 02:56:08.340]  Become a sponsor.
[02:56:08.340 --> 02:56:09.580]  Send him 100 bucks a month.
[02:56:09.580 --> 02:56:15.020]  If people with money don't start spending money in the fight, we can't block Soros.
[02:56:15.020 --> 02:56:17.140]  He thinks he can break the will of everybody.
[02:56:17.140 --> 02:56:18.140]  My gosh.
[02:56:18.140 --> 02:56:22.460]  I get on radio stations, get ratings on them after about a year, good ratings.
[02:56:22.460 --> 02:56:26.700]  They come in and pay $500,000.
[02:56:26.700 --> 02:56:32.380]  Just one example, to take me off local radio here in Austin, they sign a contract of sponsorship
[02:56:32.380 --> 02:56:37.060]  pursuant to me being taken off the air, and it's a multinational corporation, and it goes
[02:56:37.060 --> 02:56:38.060]  on all over the country.
[02:56:38.060 --> 02:56:39.620]  In fact, it's a well-known thing.
[02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:43.020]  Stations put me on, within a year, generally, they get top ratings or near it.
[02:56:43.020 --> 02:56:44.820]  It's been done all over the country.
[02:56:44.820 --> 02:56:49.500]  ESPN comes in, whoever comes in buys it for three times what it's worth at the time.
[02:56:49.500 --> 02:56:54.780]  As soon as I'm off, about in a year they pull it, the station puts me back on, ESPN's back
[02:56:54.780 --> 02:56:55.780]  in six months.
[02:56:55.780 --> 02:56:56.780]  So it's well-known.
[02:56:56.780 --> 02:57:01.300]  You put me on, it gets the ratings, they will come to buy me off the station.
[02:57:01.300 --> 02:57:04.540]  So the big joke is, you put me on to get them to come to get money.
[02:57:04.540 --> 02:57:05.540]  I don't care.
[02:57:05.540 --> 02:57:08.540]  Put me off for six months a year, pull me off.
[02:57:08.540 --> 02:57:09.900]  That's the war level we're at.
[02:57:09.900 --> 02:57:12.900]  But whatever you do, listeners realize we're in a full war.
[02:57:12.900 --> 02:57:15.980]  We need you to spread the live links, spread the articles, spread the videos that I should
[02:57:15.980 --> 02:57:18.220]  do a better job talking about, because there's so many of them.
[02:57:18.220 --> 02:57:22.900]  We'll do a few calls when we come back then, Anthony Cumi of Compound Media is coming up.
[02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:26.220]  It's good to know he's out there, good to know Drudge is out there, good to know CRTV's
[02:57:26.220 --> 02:57:32.500]  out there, good to know One American Network, all those folks, because it's good to know
[02:57:32.500 --> 02:57:36.100]  there's other people out there fighting because I tell you, man, we're in a war, and they're
[02:57:36.100 --> 02:57:37.500]  trying to start a physical war.
[02:57:37.500 --> 02:57:41.020]  As Nigel Farage said earlier, we'll be back in the 34-hour transmission.
[02:57:41.020 --> 02:57:42.020]  Stay with us.
[02:57:42.020 --> 02:57:43.020]  Are you fighting?
[02:57:43.020 --> 02:57:44.020]  Are you fighting?
[02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:50.260]  The reason InfoWars Live has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want
[02:57:50.260 --> 02:57:51.700]  products I'm going to use for my family.
[02:57:51.700 --> 02:57:52.700]  I take this.
[02:57:52.700 --> 02:57:53.860]  My family takes this.
[02:57:53.860 --> 02:57:57.380]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going
[02:57:57.380 --> 02:57:58.380]  to find anywhere.
[02:57:58.380 --> 02:58:02.700]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:58:02.700 --> 02:58:07.260]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:58:07.260 --> 02:58:08.460]  I don't feel good.
[02:58:08.460 --> 02:58:12.140]  And the nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[02:58:12.140 --> 02:58:14.820]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:58:14.820 --> 02:58:19.660]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once
[02:58:19.660 --> 02:58:20.660]  again.
[02:58:20.660 --> 02:58:26.460]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair is a little luxurious
[02:58:26.460 --> 02:58:27.460]  once again.
[02:58:27.460 --> 02:58:29.340]  So obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[02:58:29.340 --> 02:58:30.340]  I love it.
[02:58:30.340 --> 02:58:33.060]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[02:58:33.060 --> 02:58:34.060]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:58:34.060 --> 02:58:37.420]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent
[02:58:37.420 --> 02:58:39.540]  iodine, Survival Shield X2.
[02:58:39.540 --> 02:58:41.660]  It's got a five star rating.
[02:58:41.660 --> 02:58:46.420]  It's a win-win InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:58:46.420 --> 02:58:52.740]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[02:58:52.740 --> 02:58:59.140]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[02:58:59.140 --> 02:59:06.380]  or videos or other material from InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:59:06.380 --> 02:59:11.300]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[02:59:11.300 --> 02:59:12.300]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:12.300 --> 02:59:15.980]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[02:59:15.980 --> 02:59:19.820]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:59:19.820 --> 02:59:22.260]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:59:22.260 --> 02:59:26.340]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, the colloidal silver
[02:59:26.340 --> 02:59:34.180]  and iodine as well, InfoWarsLive.com, or AAA-253-3139, and your purchase of the products stands
[02:59:34.180 --> 02:59:37.700]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[02:59:37.700 --> 02:59:41.940]  satanic pedophile armies, and that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and
[02:59:41.940 --> 02:59:49.460]  they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:59:49.460 --> 02:59:54.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:54.180 --> 03:00:04.860]  Yeah, I don't fear the Reaper unless there's a nuclear war and we all get killed.
[03:00:04.860 --> 03:00:09.700]  I don't fear death, but I fear death of the planet, death of the species, and our great
[03:00:09.700 --> 03:00:10.700]  quest failing.
[03:00:10.700 --> 03:00:14.020]  Yeah, I'm pro-human, not a globalist.
[03:00:14.020 --> 03:00:16.460]  I like myself, so I project that on other people.
[03:00:16.460 --> 03:00:20.820]  Anthony Comey is coming up riding shotgun with me during the 34-hour global transmission.
[03:00:20.820 --> 03:00:22.460]  We're now six hours into.
[03:00:22.460 --> 03:00:24.260]  Steve West Virginia, you're a trooper.
[03:00:24.260 --> 03:00:25.580]  Thank you for holding so long.
[03:00:25.580 --> 03:00:26.580]  God bless you.
[03:00:26.580 --> 03:00:27.580]  You're on the air.
[03:00:27.580 --> 03:00:28.580]  Yeah, Alex.
[03:00:28.580 --> 03:00:32.740]  In globalists and deep state, they need a war.
[03:00:32.740 --> 03:00:35.940]  It's not about gas or money or oil.
[03:00:35.940 --> 03:00:39.820]  It's about patriotism and Christianity.
[03:00:39.820 --> 03:00:45.140]  When Putin said he was moving out of Syria, they had a gas attack here in Salisbury.
[03:00:45.140 --> 03:00:47.580]  Trump says he's pulling out another gas attack.
[03:00:47.580 --> 03:00:51.940]  Who do you think these countries, the Hull of War at the time, are they going to send
[03:00:51.940 --> 03:00:57.620]  them tens of millions of refugees, Muslim immigrants, or are they going to be one fight
[03:00:57.620 --> 03:00:58.620]  in the battle?
[03:00:58.620 --> 03:01:02.020]  Or is it going to be the Christian Patriots out on the front line?
[03:01:02.020 --> 03:01:04.940]  Same here with Nikki Haley in the United States.
[03:01:04.940 --> 03:01:10.860]  I'm a United States Marine Corps veteran, and I know for a fact that we fight for God's
[03:01:10.860 --> 03:01:11.860]  family and country.
[03:01:11.860 --> 03:01:17.180]  Once they get rid of the Christians, when the Patriots take a walk all over this world.
[03:01:17.180 --> 03:01:20.460]  Well, as you heard Nigel Farage earlier, what a great leader.
[03:01:20.460 --> 03:01:25.860]  What a great person that sees into the future a seer.
[03:01:25.860 --> 03:01:29.060]  He said they want to destroy Christians, period.
[03:01:29.060 --> 03:01:30.420]  And that's Russia's crime.
[03:01:30.420 --> 03:01:35.500]  The left love Russia because they could go over there and literally take holidays and
[03:01:35.500 --> 03:01:37.340]  kill Christians in cages.
[03:01:37.340 --> 03:01:38.340]  And now they can't do it.
[03:01:38.340 --> 03:01:39.340]  They hate it.
[03:01:39.340 --> 03:01:40.340]  Hollywood hates it.
[03:01:40.340 --> 03:01:41.340]  The left hates it.
[03:01:41.340 --> 03:01:42.340]  They can't go have their honeymoon there now.
[03:01:42.340 --> 03:01:43.340]  That's correct.
[03:01:43.340 --> 03:01:46.700]  Once they get rid of the Christians and the Patriots, they can just walk all over the
[03:01:46.700 --> 03:01:47.700]  world.
[03:01:47.700 --> 03:01:51.500]  And they know that, that's why they need a war, if it ain't going to be with Russia,
[03:01:51.500 --> 03:01:53.020]  it's going to be with somebody else.
[03:01:53.020 --> 03:01:55.100]  You notice that's all they push.
[03:01:55.100 --> 03:01:59.980]  Every time the least little thing happens, even before President Trump became president
[03:01:59.980 --> 03:02:05.220]  to mainstream media and all of them was hollering, war with Russia, war with Russia.
[03:02:05.220 --> 03:02:08.580]  If Italy would have got elected, we didn't bend in war with Russia.
[03:02:08.580 --> 03:02:11.420]  Well, that's because Russia's the one that got away.
[03:02:11.420 --> 03:02:14.780]  The left took it over, killed millions of Russians, used Russia to kill tens of millions
[03:02:14.780 --> 03:02:15.780]  more.
[03:02:15.780 --> 03:02:19.820]  Again, they gang raped that country and gouged those Christians' eyes out, starved to death
[03:02:19.820 --> 03:02:20.820]  good.
[03:02:20.820 --> 03:02:25.060]  All those commasars, massive Lincoln brigades, Abraham Lincoln brigades, went over there
[03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:27.540]  to have fun and get to torture Christians.
[03:02:27.540 --> 03:02:32.140]  And now their big torture factory has been taken over and they just are so mad Russia
[03:02:32.140 --> 03:02:33.140]  came back.
[03:02:33.140 --> 03:02:34.140]  God bless you, Steve.
[03:02:34.140 --> 03:02:35.140]  Great points.
[03:02:35.140 --> 03:02:39.500]  James and Louisiana, you're on the air worldwide, and then another James in Spokane, Washington.
[03:02:39.500 --> 03:02:45.540]  James and Louisiana, you're on the air.
[03:02:45.540 --> 03:02:46.540]  Go ahead.
[03:02:46.540 --> 03:02:47.540]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:47.540 --> 03:02:48.540]  Hi there.
[03:02:48.540 --> 03:02:56.340]  I just want to start off saying, man, the iodine, man, worked wonders, lost a lot of
[03:02:56.340 --> 03:03:03.580]  weight, just started back working out, man, it got me healthy.
[03:03:03.580 --> 03:03:16.780]  But I want to talk about flushing the Gators out of the swamp, man, I think the next move
[03:03:16.780 --> 03:03:19.220]  would be to hit them from a different side.
[03:03:19.220 --> 03:03:30.180]  I remember whenever they had shot, they came out on CNN, the CIA black project came coming
[03:03:30.180 --> 03:03:35.300]  out with the UFO video and everything.
[03:03:35.300 --> 03:03:41.700]  The fact is they had admitted that that technology does exist.
[03:03:41.700 --> 03:03:44.740]  Could that be enough angle that we can hit them on?
[03:03:44.740 --> 03:03:45.740]  Absolutely.
[03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:47.900]  I mean, there's all sorts of stuff we can hit them on.
[03:03:47.900 --> 03:03:50.700]  People going out and telling Bill Clinton he's a rapist everywhere he goes or coming
[03:03:50.700 --> 03:03:54.980]  when he goes on the road at signing books, everybody should front him, videotape it,
[03:03:54.980 --> 03:03:56.140]  shut him down.
[03:03:56.140 --> 03:04:00.140]  You taking action, you getting in the street, but not like communists beating people up,
[03:04:00.140 --> 03:04:04.540]  going to events, going to book signings, getting on C-SPAN, taking over the media, calling
[03:04:04.540 --> 03:04:05.820]  in to talk radio.
[03:04:05.820 --> 03:04:06.820]  You have the power.
[03:04:06.820 --> 03:04:07.820]  They fear you.
[03:04:07.820 --> 03:04:08.820]  It's why they fear this broadcast.
[03:04:08.820 --> 03:04:09.820]  Yes, sir.
[03:04:09.820 --> 03:04:19.740]  And then the fact that Trump's uncle had, was able to look at Nikola Tesla's payipers after
[03:04:19.740 --> 03:04:22.140]  he, like, after he had died.
[03:04:22.140 --> 03:04:23.140]  Yeah, no.
[03:04:23.140 --> 03:04:24.660]  Trump knows a lot about the secret technology.
[03:04:24.660 --> 03:04:25.660]  Absolutely.
[03:04:25.660 --> 03:04:26.660]  He knows about globalism.
[03:04:26.660 --> 03:04:30.300]  And we'll see what happens because he's starting to go sideways, but we're praying he wakes
[03:04:30.300 --> 03:04:31.300]  up.
[03:04:31.300 --> 03:04:32.300]  He'll be right back.
[03:04:32.300 --> 03:04:33.300]  Thank you, James.
[03:04:33.300 --> 03:04:34.300]  We've got James at Spokane.
[03:04:34.300 --> 03:04:35.300]  I'll get to you too.
[03:04:35.300 --> 03:04:36.300]  But Anthony Kumiya is coming up.
[03:04:36.300 --> 03:04:37.300]  He's going to be hosting this hour.
[03:04:37.300 --> 03:04:40.500]  I'm going to finish up on Robert Mueller with him and get his take on that.
[03:04:40.500 --> 03:04:43.020]  And then the War with Oven Shroyer.
[03:04:43.020 --> 03:04:48.540]  So many other big guests throughout the next, well, now it's 27 hours or 28, I got 28 hours
[03:04:48.540 --> 03:04:49.540]  that are left.
[03:04:49.540 --> 03:04:54.740]  In the global transmission, stop war with Russia, global emergency broadcast.
[03:04:54.740 --> 03:04:55.740]  I'm so excited.
[03:04:55.740 --> 03:05:01.060]  This is a new product at infowarslife.com in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled
[03:05:01.060 --> 03:05:05.900]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:05:05.900 --> 03:05:11.340]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:05:11.340 --> 03:05:14.300]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[03:05:14.300 --> 03:05:20.300]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[03:05:20.300 --> 03:05:26.940]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[03:05:26.940 --> 03:05:31.980]  And I came up with our own formulae, working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made
[03:05:31.980 --> 03:05:34.140]  right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:05:34.140 --> 03:05:40.460]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the
[03:05:40.460 --> 03:05:44.780]  hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:44.780 --> 03:05:47.580]  It is amazing.
[03:05:47.580 --> 03:05:54.580]  Good pill now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:06:17.580 --> 03:06:35.140]  There's a very powerful video that's going to be posted on YouTube and Facebook in the
[03:06:35.140 --> 03:06:36.140]  next 10 minutes.
[03:06:36.140 --> 03:06:43.020]  He was on with us two hours ago, Nigel Farage, the globalist want war with Russia.
[03:06:43.020 --> 03:06:44.740]  Well, it's even worse than that.
[03:06:44.740 --> 03:06:47.140]  The headline is Nigel Farage.
[03:06:47.140 --> 03:06:56.420]  The globalist hate Christians want war with Russia, and they hate Christians because they
[03:06:56.420 --> 03:06:59.620]  want to be God.
[03:06:59.620 --> 03:07:01.020]  They want total control.
[03:07:01.020 --> 03:07:06.540]  They want total power, and they want radical Islam as their operating system.
[03:07:06.540 --> 03:07:11.700]  Now, joining us is the fellow that hosts every couple of weeks.
[03:07:11.700 --> 03:07:19.020]  He has his own great media operation, compoundmedia.com, and he's got a lot to cover today, but I
[03:07:19.020 --> 03:07:23.860]  got behind, and he always invites me on, so I appreciate it, and I wanted to get his take
[03:07:23.860 --> 03:07:27.180]  on Mueller because we've been focused on the neo-cons, trying to start World War 3 with
[03:07:27.180 --> 03:07:31.340]  Russia and Pompeo saying we're already killed hundreds of Russians and thought that he wouldn't
[03:07:31.340 --> 03:07:32.500]  help us take out ISIS.
[03:07:32.500 --> 03:07:36.220]  I wanted to play these clips and get your take on it.
[03:07:36.220 --> 03:07:41.780]  We've got Rand Paul Warren's Mueller's enormous power can be used against anybody.
[03:07:41.780 --> 03:07:44.020]  Yeah, who who died made him king of the universe.
[03:07:44.020 --> 03:07:47.820]  Let's play that clip, and then a few others against Anthony Cooney's take on this.
[03:07:47.820 --> 03:07:48.820]  Here it is.
[03:07:48.820 --> 03:07:53.380]  So, I think this investigation no longer has much to do with Russia, but I would warn
[03:07:53.380 --> 03:07:58.020]  people around America who say, oh, they don't like the president, oh, this is just fine
[03:07:58.020 --> 03:07:59.700]  because it's against President Trump.
[03:07:59.700 --> 03:08:02.820]  This is an enormous power that can be used against anybody.
[03:08:02.820 --> 03:08:06.620]  You remember what Chuck Schumer said a couple of months ago, he says, if you cross the
[03:08:06.620 --> 03:08:10.940]  intelligence agencies, they can screw you six ways to Sunday.
[03:08:10.940 --> 03:08:16.060]  This is about enormous power, prosecutorial power, but also power in the intelligence
[03:08:16.060 --> 03:08:17.060]  communities.
[03:08:17.060 --> 03:08:22.740]  We have to rein this in, or every American citizen is exposed to this kind of abuse of
[03:08:22.740 --> 03:08:23.740]  power.
[03:08:23.740 --> 03:08:24.740]  How would you rein it in?
[03:08:24.740 --> 03:08:29.460]  If you find a major political crisis on your hands, go ahead.
[03:08:29.460 --> 03:08:30.460]  It's hard now.
[03:08:30.460 --> 03:08:34.140]  It's actually hard politically to fire Mueller, but the thing is, we never should have had
[03:08:34.140 --> 03:08:38.900]  Mueller in the first place because we've given too much power to a prosecutor who's no longer
[03:08:38.900 --> 03:08:40.340]  looking at Russia.
[03:08:40.340 --> 03:08:44.380]  He's looking at some kind of personal dealings with the president's lawyer.
[03:08:44.380 --> 03:08:48.060]  And imagine, once they get this, they've got all of the information that the president
[03:08:48.060 --> 03:08:51.300]  has ever discussed with the attorney, and they say, oh, we're not going to use this
[03:08:51.300 --> 03:08:55.340]  stuff that's attorney-client privilege, but they're going to read it, and you think once
[03:08:55.340 --> 03:08:58.340]  they've read it, it might give them ideas of other places to look at.
[03:08:58.340 --> 03:08:59.340]  Let's go.
[03:08:59.340 --> 03:09:00.340]  Let's stop right there.
[03:09:00.340 --> 03:09:04.940]  It's certainly illegal to go after the lawyer to begin with is cooked up, but I was reading
[03:09:04.940 --> 03:09:08.340]  the law to look at the stuff is illegal.
[03:09:08.340 --> 03:09:09.340]  They're doing it all.
[03:09:09.340 --> 03:09:13.500]  These are cornered rat criminals caught in bed with Russia, China, you name it, that
[03:09:13.500 --> 03:09:15.000]  hate the country.
[03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:16.000]  They're cornered rats.
[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:20.620]  I mean, Mueller used to deliver uranium to the Russians on tarmacs in Moscow.
[03:09:20.620 --> 03:09:26.340]  It's like Hitler is like trying Netanyahu for being anti-Israel.
[03:09:26.340 --> 03:09:27.900]  Mueller's Hitler, Trump's Netanyahu.
[03:09:27.900 --> 03:09:34.180]  I mean, that's how, remember, Hank Williams Jr. said, well, such and such with Obama,
[03:09:34.180 --> 03:09:38.780]  you know, Obama and Israel's like Hitler and Netanyahu, and he got fired off my football.
[03:09:38.780 --> 03:09:41.700]  That's how crazy this is.
[03:09:41.700 --> 03:09:43.900]  And then, of course, Alan Dershowitz makes the same point.
[03:09:43.900 --> 03:09:44.900]  He's a Democrat.
[03:09:44.900 --> 03:09:47.860]  Mueller is committing subterfuge, and it's dangerous.
[03:09:47.860 --> 03:09:48.860]  Here's that clip.
[03:09:48.860 --> 03:09:52.580]  What we're seeing is a bifurcation of the investigation.
[03:09:52.580 --> 03:09:57.460]  I think Mueller has now acknowledged that he doesn't have the authority to look into
[03:09:57.460 --> 03:10:02.580]  Mr. Donald Trump's pre-presidential activities, and so he's filtered that off and given that
[03:10:02.580 --> 03:10:07.980]  to the Southern District of New York, which is now going to investigate those aspects
[03:10:07.980 --> 03:10:12.500]  because apparently they couldn't find anything substantial when it comes to the president's
[03:10:12.500 --> 03:10:14.300]  exercise of his Article II authority.
[03:10:14.300 --> 03:10:16.540]  The president had the right to fire a Comey.
[03:10:16.540 --> 03:10:20.060]  He had the right to determine what was to be investigated.
[03:10:20.060 --> 03:10:23.500]  He would have the right to pardon, though I don't think it would be a wise thing to
[03:10:23.500 --> 03:10:25.300]  do at this time.
[03:10:25.300 --> 03:10:30.260]  But they're now moving some of the case over to the Southern District to look into some
[03:10:30.260 --> 03:10:35.740]  other matters regarding his lawyer, his private activities, some negotiated settlements.
[03:10:35.740 --> 03:10:41.820]  That seems like a subterfuge by which Mueller doesn't have the authority, so he gives it
[03:10:41.820 --> 03:10:44.220]  to somebody else, gives them the information.
[03:10:44.220 --> 03:10:46.940]  It's like laundering information to another prosecutor.
[03:10:46.940 --> 03:10:47.940]  Let's stop right there.
[03:10:47.940 --> 03:10:48.940]  Yeah.
[03:10:48.940 --> 03:10:51.700]  Let's stop the construction because they were already legally spying on Trump.
[03:10:51.700 --> 03:10:53.380]  We didn't elect a saint.
[03:10:53.380 --> 03:10:56.340]  He never said, I don't like hot women.
[03:10:56.340 --> 03:11:01.460]  We wanted to do what he says he'll do politically, and he's delivered 98% on that.
[03:11:01.460 --> 03:11:02.820]  This is so dangerous.
[03:11:02.820 --> 03:11:05.900]  The cancer has now metastasized, just like we knew it would.
[03:11:05.900 --> 03:11:09.860]  Rodgers Jones will be on the war room later, breaking down all he predicted, all this.
[03:11:09.860 --> 03:11:11.900]  Anthony Cooney, I got a few other clips you're taking over.
[03:11:11.900 --> 03:11:12.900]  We really appreciate you.
[03:11:12.900 --> 03:11:13.900]  By the way, you're welcome to pop in.
[03:11:13.900 --> 03:11:17.860]  And during the rest of the 34-hour broadcast, we'd love to get you on my show routinely.
[03:11:17.860 --> 03:11:21.820]  I ran a couple of your fans while I was in DC and at the airport.
[03:11:21.820 --> 03:11:23.500]  This is just a frickin' nightmare.
[03:11:23.500 --> 03:11:26.420]  I mean, Rosenstein's a Clinton operative.
[03:11:26.420 --> 03:11:27.820]  He creates this guy.
[03:11:27.820 --> 03:11:32.220]  They change the power structure, then they say, oh, better not fire us.
[03:11:32.220 --> 03:11:36.220]  And now they've metastasized it to all these other places, and they're looking at bimbos
[03:11:36.220 --> 03:11:38.700]  that the president might have boinked 11 years ago.
[03:11:38.700 --> 03:11:41.100]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:11:41.100 --> 03:11:43.940]  I can't believe, look, I'm not special.
[03:11:43.940 --> 03:11:50.980]  I don't have this special vision to see these shenanigans, if I may say, going on.
[03:11:50.980 --> 03:11:52.300]  But I see them.
[03:11:52.300 --> 03:11:55.260]  Who can't see what is going on?
[03:11:55.260 --> 03:12:00.980]  This is a concerted effort to take down a democratically elected president.
[03:12:00.980 --> 03:12:03.620]  There's no other motive going on here.
[03:12:03.620 --> 03:12:07.020]  You could call it a fishing expedition, a witch hunt, all that.
[03:12:07.020 --> 03:12:12.820]  This is so much more nefarious than those fun-loving terms.
[03:12:12.820 --> 03:12:14.500]  It's a coup, isn't it?
[03:12:14.500 --> 03:12:15.860]  It is a coup.
[03:12:15.860 --> 03:12:24.260]  This is when Trump's lawyer's office gets raided by the FBI, and they have a warrant.
[03:12:24.260 --> 03:12:26.820]  These warrants are supposed to be specific.
[03:12:26.820 --> 03:12:28.780]  What crime was committed?
[03:12:28.780 --> 03:12:35.660]  Why did they give them a warrant to go into a lawyer's office, infringe that sacred right
[03:12:35.660 --> 03:12:42.540]  of client lawyer privilege, and search for something?
[03:12:42.540 --> 03:12:44.260]  What are they looking for?
[03:12:44.260 --> 03:12:51.020]  What did they have that they gave to a judge that gave them the ability to search a lawyer's
[03:12:51.020 --> 03:12:52.020]  office?
[03:12:52.020 --> 03:12:56.660]  That is a real bond, a sacred bond between each other.
[03:12:56.660 --> 03:13:00.340]  Well, that violates two different amendments to the first 10 Bill of Rights, but expanding
[03:13:00.340 --> 03:13:02.540]  on that, parallel construction.
[03:13:02.540 --> 03:13:04.060]  These agencies use illegal surveillance.
[03:13:04.060 --> 03:13:05.060]  They've already got it.
[03:13:05.060 --> 03:13:07.980]  It came out in documents a year ago that I was being surveilled six years ago, and so
[03:13:07.980 --> 03:13:08.980]  was Trump.
[03:13:08.980 --> 03:13:11.620]  The DEA leaked that through Sheriff Arpaio.
[03:13:11.620 --> 03:13:12.620]  This is parallel construction.
[03:13:12.620 --> 03:13:16.780]  It has nothing to do with the original investigation, but you know, Trump is smarter than that.
[03:13:16.780 --> 03:13:20.700]  He never did anything wrong, but of course, did they take care of some women or whatever?
[03:13:20.700 --> 03:13:21.700]  Yeah.
[03:13:21.700 --> 03:13:23.740]  We know he's not a fricking saini ram beauty contest.
[03:13:23.740 --> 03:13:26.100]  The whole, his crime is he's not a pedophile or something.
[03:13:26.100 --> 03:13:28.540]  And so what's really going on here is parallel construction.
[03:13:28.540 --> 03:13:31.860]  I think Trump is smart enough to know his whole operation was under surveillance, and
[03:13:31.860 --> 03:13:35.340]  whatever stuff they're trying to twist, I have a feeling is long gone.
[03:13:35.340 --> 03:13:36.740]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:13:36.740 --> 03:13:38.140]  I would hope so.
[03:13:38.140 --> 03:13:42.580]  Trump does come off as a smart guy when it comes to this kind of stuff.
[03:13:42.580 --> 03:13:46.060]  He won't fall into a lot of their traps that they're setting up.
[03:13:46.060 --> 03:13:48.500]  And that's exactly what this is.
[03:13:48.500 --> 03:13:53.300]  When Chuck Schumer the other day said that the president doesn't have the right or the
[03:13:53.300 --> 03:13:56.780]  ability to fire Mueller, I don't think he should.
[03:13:56.780 --> 03:13:59.060]  I think that would be a, but he does have the right.
[03:13:59.060 --> 03:14:00.060]  He does have the right.
[03:14:00.060 --> 03:14:01.060]  He does have the right.
[03:14:01.060 --> 03:14:02.060]  Who's Mueller?
[03:14:02.060 --> 03:14:03.060]  What is he?
[03:14:03.060 --> 03:14:05.780]  He's, he's higher than the president of the United States.
[03:14:05.780 --> 03:14:08.660]  And even the president doesn't have the ability to fire this guy.
[03:14:08.660 --> 03:14:13.980]  He could do anything he wants, search, why I said months ago, he's like Imper Mueller.
[03:14:13.980 --> 03:14:14.980]  He's like God.
[03:14:14.980 --> 03:14:16.700]  He just does whatever he wants.
[03:14:16.700 --> 03:14:18.260]  He could do whatever he wants.
[03:14:18.260 --> 03:14:25.820]  And you're not seeing anybody budging on, on trying to tame this guy down.
[03:14:25.820 --> 03:14:29.140]  You know, I look, get through the investigation, whatever it is.
[03:14:29.140 --> 03:14:32.580]  But it's at the point where it's so obvious what this is.
[03:14:32.580 --> 03:14:34.460]  This is no longer an investigation.
[03:14:34.460 --> 03:14:35.900]  It's a coup d'etat.
[03:14:35.900 --> 03:14:36.900]  You're absolutely right.
[03:14:36.900 --> 03:14:37.900]  Let's go out to break it.
[03:14:37.900 --> 03:14:38.900]  You're taking over.
[03:14:38.900 --> 03:14:40.940]  Anthony Cooney and compoundmedia.com is here on fire.
[03:14:40.940 --> 03:14:43.380]  Let's play whoopie Goldberg licking her lips like Bayard.
[03:14:43.380 --> 03:14:45.620]  Oh, Flynn says he's a Russian agent.
[03:14:45.620 --> 03:14:46.620]  Trump's going to prison.
[03:14:46.620 --> 03:14:47.620]  None of that was true.
[03:14:47.620 --> 03:14:48.940]  Here's Goldberg licking her lips.
[03:14:48.940 --> 03:14:50.740]  Oh, let's bring down the American recovery.
[03:14:50.740 --> 03:14:51.740]  Let's arrest Trump.
[03:14:51.740 --> 03:14:53.420]  Oh, let's have riots.
[03:14:53.420 --> 03:14:57.900]  Exactly what documents show Obama and Soros wanted to suspend the election, but you failed
[03:14:57.900 --> 03:14:59.540]  and you'll fail again.
[03:14:59.540 --> 03:15:01.860]  And we have separate powers in government.
[03:15:01.860 --> 03:15:03.180]  They can't arrest the president.
[03:15:03.180 --> 03:15:04.180]  They can't do it dummies.
[03:15:04.180 --> 03:15:06.860]  Unless we impeach him, and America is too smart.
[03:15:06.860 --> 03:15:09.060]  I believe here it is.
[03:15:09.060 --> 03:15:13.020]  Everything you're saying about what would happen if he does firemuller, I've said, Lindsey
[03:15:13.020 --> 03:15:15.020]  Graham has said it's political suicide.
[03:15:15.020 --> 03:15:18.740]  I 100% think there would be, I think you'd actually be rioting in Washington, DC.
[03:15:18.740 --> 03:15:19.740]  I think it would be.
[03:15:19.740 --> 03:15:20.740]  That would be what we haven't seen.
[03:15:20.740 --> 03:15:21.740]  I have to say.
[03:15:21.740 --> 03:15:27.340]  Yeah, I mean, but I think it would take levels that we can't comprehend since the Nixon era.
[03:15:27.340 --> 03:15:33.100]  And I don't think we should get too far ahead since hasn't happened yet.
[03:15:33.100 --> 03:15:34.540]  Can you imagine they won a civil war?
[03:15:34.540 --> 03:15:39.060]  The Democrat, Rob Reiner says it's a civil war and they're they're pushing the Democrats
[03:15:39.060 --> 03:15:43.780]  always hate the FBI like Mueller is God, Anthony Cumming is straight ahead in the war room

[03:16:03.820 --> 03:16:04.820]  government ever.

[03:20:09.500 --> 03:20:12.180]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:20:12.180 --> 03:20:20.980]  It is the Alex Jones show with Anthony Kumiya.
[03:20:20.980 --> 03:20:28.060]  Welcome Anthony Kumiya in here at infowars.com, wow we're still here, isn't it amazing?
[03:20:28.060 --> 03:20:30.500]  We haven't blown up yet.
[03:20:30.500 --> 03:20:35.940]  It really is interesting being here because I'm broadcasting from New York City, which
[03:20:35.940 --> 03:20:39.860]  wow, there's what you call a primary target.
[03:20:39.860 --> 03:20:44.460]  I don't have a hope in the world.
[03:20:44.460 --> 03:20:53.180]  If I got notification that missiles were enroute, I guess I'd have a drink, hang out, wax fantastic
[03:20:53.180 --> 03:20:59.260]  about the old days with a few friends for nine minutes and that would be that.
[03:20:59.260 --> 03:21:06.540]  I can't remember and I was a child during the Cold War days, back in the late 60s, early
[03:21:06.540 --> 03:21:13.220]  70s, and I remember how terrifying it was.
[03:21:13.220 --> 03:21:19.940]  Every so often you'd think like, hey, there's a lot of missiles pointing at us right now.
[03:21:19.940 --> 03:21:24.900]  Just right there, right now, pointing at us, just a bunch of missiles and it would freak
[03:21:24.900 --> 03:21:28.260]  you out as a kid a little bit.
[03:21:28.260 --> 03:21:34.860]  As time went on and things simmered down, everybody kind of relaxed.
[03:21:34.860 --> 03:21:44.700]  We let out a little refreshing sigh of relief after the Berlin Wall came down and Perestroika
[03:21:44.700 --> 03:21:49.200]  and Gorbachev talking with Reagan.
[03:21:49.200 --> 03:21:54.500]  It just all seemed to get a lot calmer.
[03:21:54.500 --> 03:22:01.460]  There wasn't that impending doom that as a child, just having a piano strung over your
[03:22:01.460 --> 03:22:08.460]  head by a thin little wire that was, everything that was taking place was done by people you
[03:22:08.460 --> 03:22:12.980]  didn't know and you didn't know what they were doing to keep you safe.
[03:22:12.980 --> 03:22:18.340]  You find out years later things like the Cuban Missile Crisis and other very close calls
[03:22:18.340 --> 03:22:24.580]  that we had over the course of the Cold War and it was frightening.
[03:22:24.580 --> 03:22:34.100]  But living through that and that type of fear and anxiety, I got to tell you, it's back.
[03:22:34.100 --> 03:22:37.500]  It is back right now.
[03:22:37.500 --> 03:22:46.100]  I am not very confident about this theory of thing.
[03:22:46.100 --> 03:22:52.220]  I honestly don't think we should be involved in this, in that we were involved with getting
[03:22:52.220 --> 03:22:54.940]  rid of ISIS.
[03:22:54.940 --> 03:22:58.420]  That's good.
[03:22:58.420 --> 03:23:01.700]  We had an enemy there and we knew where they were.
[03:23:01.700 --> 03:23:02.780]  We knew what they were doing.
[03:23:02.780 --> 03:23:09.620]  They were a direct threat to us, the United States of America, direct threat.
[03:23:09.620 --> 03:23:14.860]  So we had to take care of business and one of Trump's campaign promises was indeed taking
[03:23:14.860 --> 03:23:19.420]  care of ISIS and he has made good on that promise.
[03:23:19.420 --> 03:23:21.060]  They are decimated.
[03:23:21.060 --> 03:23:27.540]  They are almost crushed and again, from what we're being told, that's always taken with
[03:23:27.540 --> 03:23:33.460]  somewhat of a grain of salt even if it's from somebody you do respect and believe in.
[03:23:33.460 --> 03:23:35.940]  But that was the mission.
[03:23:35.940 --> 03:23:45.380]  Now we see some children and they've apparently been gassed by Assad's regime in Syria and
[03:23:45.380 --> 03:23:53.220]  then that's our signal to swoop in and save the children.
[03:23:53.220 --> 03:23:55.420]  It's always presented that way.
[03:23:55.420 --> 03:24:04.540]  We must save these poor children from Assad and chlorine gas and nerve agents and last
[03:24:04.540 --> 03:24:10.260]  I heard no one knows who the hell did this if indeed it was done.
[03:24:10.260 --> 03:24:17.180]  I know Mad Dog Mattis has come out publicly and said that he does believe indeed there
[03:24:17.180 --> 03:24:26.660]  was a gas used against people but nobody has had a definitive answer as to who did this.
[03:24:26.660 --> 03:24:32.060]  And we are already, this went from, mind you, let's do a little, let's backtrack a little.
[03:24:32.060 --> 03:24:37.140]  Oh, we don't have to backtrack far, just a few days as a matter of fact.
[03:24:37.140 --> 03:24:43.940]  Donald Trump, President Trump said, wow, we really should pull out of Syria at some point.
[03:24:43.940 --> 03:24:47.460]  We've done very well against ISIS.
[03:24:47.460 --> 03:24:56.020]  Once the job is done there, I'd like to pull our troops out and cease our operations in
[03:24:56.020 --> 03:24:58.180]  Syria.
[03:24:58.180 --> 03:25:06.300]  Well almost immediately, suspiciously quick, there was a gas attack in Syria.
[03:25:06.300 --> 03:25:17.220]  Because if somebody doesn't want us to leave Syria, again, who that is, I don't know.
[03:25:17.220 --> 03:25:21.100]  But that was the chain of events almost immediately.
[03:25:21.100 --> 03:25:27.380]  And it goes from that to now us gearing up, we got carrier groups moving.
[03:25:27.380 --> 03:25:34.780]  We got Donald Trump, President Trump tweeting about what sounds to be imminent attacks
[03:25:34.780 --> 03:25:41.380]  on somewhere in Syria, again, who the hell knows, who, where, what.
[03:25:41.380 --> 03:25:44.460]  And of course the Russia angle on the whole thing.
[03:25:44.460 --> 03:25:48.420]  Now he's saying, I never said an attack on Syria would take place, could be very soon
[03:25:48.420 --> 03:25:50.060]  or not soon at all.
[03:25:50.060 --> 03:25:54.460]  In any event, the United States under my administration has done a great job of ridding the region
[03:25:54.460 --> 03:26:03.540]  of ISIS, whereas our thank you America, it's always a treat reading Donald's tweets.
[03:26:03.540 --> 03:26:11.940]  But yeah, now he's had to dial back his initial tweet that said, the missiles are coming,
[03:26:11.940 --> 03:26:16.100]  they're new, they're beautiful, they're smart.
[03:26:16.100 --> 03:26:25.020]  And that seemed like a very ominous, absolute, that we would be engaging in some type of
[03:26:25.020 --> 03:26:27.300]  military activity over there in Syria.
[03:26:27.300 --> 03:26:32.340]  Now there are a lot of Russians, a lot of Iranians over there in Syria, doing their
[03:26:32.340 --> 03:26:37.620]  own thing over there that puts a lot of people in danger.
[03:26:37.620 --> 03:26:42.580]  Now you might remember after the last gas attack, the president lobbed in some cruise
[03:26:42.580 --> 03:26:49.660]  missiles, took out a couple of runways, which were put back in operation almost immediately.
[03:26:49.660 --> 03:26:53.660]  There were some deaths, and again, Russians are over there.
[03:26:53.660 --> 03:27:02.140]  Now, if we have to again send cruise missiles and then back that up with some manned aircraft,
[03:27:02.140 --> 03:27:09.220]  this puts our pilots in danger of being downed by Russians.
[03:27:09.220 --> 03:27:17.020]  Now I don't know about you, but that sounds like a terrible escalation of events if Russia
[03:27:17.020 --> 03:27:21.980]  is now downing our aircraft and killing our pilots.
[03:27:21.980 --> 03:27:24.820]  How would we have to react to that?
[03:27:24.820 --> 03:27:31.580]  One of the scariest prospects of the whole thing is the fact that every single person
[03:27:31.580 --> 03:27:37.700]  that has been against every single thing Donald Trump has done since the election isn't against
[03:27:37.700 --> 03:27:39.580]  this.
[03:27:39.580 --> 03:27:46.620]  Donald Trump is talking about military action in Syria, and the left isn't clamoring for
[03:27:46.620 --> 03:27:52.980]  his impeachment on this, asking him to stop saying it's crazy and ridiculous and this.
[03:27:52.980 --> 03:28:02.700]  They go from Putin's puppet to this is an insane escalation of events.
[03:28:02.700 --> 03:28:06.540]  Anything Donald Trump does in their eyes is a terrible thing.
[03:28:06.540 --> 03:28:13.740]  But doesn't it kind of look to you like someone out there or an entity out there, a collection
[03:28:13.740 --> 03:28:23.140]  of people, a consortium of people, want a war and perhaps the biggest one of them all.
[03:28:23.140 --> 03:28:28.860]  The one, you know, the second half of the 20th century was based on the two big kids
[03:28:28.860 --> 03:28:32.300]  on the block duking it out.
[03:28:32.300 --> 03:28:38.420]  And yes, believe me, once one side starts losing a conventional war, oh, we're glowing
[03:28:38.420 --> 03:28:40.220]  in the dark people.
[03:28:40.220 --> 03:28:48.220]  And I must tell you, it wouldn't be a good thing, regardless of what your ideology is.
[03:28:48.220 --> 03:28:49.220]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:28:49.220 --> 03:28:50.220]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:50.220 --> 03:29:16.220]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:29:16.220 --> 03:29:42.220]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:29:42.220 --> 03:30:08.220]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:30:08.220 --> 03:30:34.220]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:30:34.220 --> 03:31:00.220]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:31:00.220 --> 03:31:26.220]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:31:26.220 --> 03:31:53.220]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:31:53.220 --> 03:32:22.220]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:32:23.220 --> 03:32:52.220]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:32:53.220 --> 03:33:20.220]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:33:20.220 --> 03:33:26.220]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:33:26.220 --> 03:33:30.220]  Stop the New World War 34-hour Infowars Store specials.

[03:34:12.220 --> 03:34:16.220]  Yeah, you got to make sure you support Infowars.
[03:34:16.220 --> 03:34:22.220]  We saw what happens when people don't want you saying what you want to say.
[03:34:22.220 --> 03:34:25.220]  Alex Jones, myself over at Compound Media.
[03:34:25.220 --> 03:34:30.220]  We can't be held hostage by sponsors.
[03:34:30.220 --> 03:34:38.220]  We need our people to support us and our sponsors because once they are taken away,
[03:34:38.220 --> 03:34:40.220]  we can't broadcast.
[03:34:40.220 --> 03:34:41.220]  We are silenced.
[03:34:41.220 --> 03:34:45.220]  We saw what happened to Laura Ingram over on Fox News.
[03:34:45.220 --> 03:34:52.220]  She talks about this David Hogg, one of these kids from the school shooting.
[03:34:52.220 --> 03:34:54.220]  And he's got an opinion.
[03:34:54.220 --> 03:35:00.220]  He's out there talking about things which immediately opens you up to something called rebuttal.
[03:35:00.220 --> 03:35:01.220]  That's right.
[03:35:01.220 --> 03:35:06.220]  Someone might not agree with an 18-year-old or 19, however old he is,
[03:35:06.220 --> 03:35:10.220]  talking about gun control and things like that.
[03:35:10.220 --> 03:35:12.220]  There's going to be opposing viewpoints.
[03:35:12.220 --> 03:35:15.220]  But the second you make an opposing viewpoint,
[03:35:15.220 --> 03:35:20.220]  you are deemed a child murderer, you have blood on your hands,
[03:35:20.220 --> 03:35:23.220]  and you should never ever be heard from again.
[03:35:23.220 --> 03:35:29.220]  So Laura Ingram, thank God Fox stood by her because I've seen a lot of people fold
[03:35:29.220 --> 03:35:32.220]  under that kind of pressure and fire people.
[03:35:32.220 --> 03:35:36.220]  And now I've gotten into some arguments with people on Twitter about this.
[03:35:36.220 --> 03:35:39.220]  They say, well, that's the marketplace.
[03:35:39.220 --> 03:35:41.220]  It's a boycott.
[03:35:41.220 --> 03:35:42.220]  We're allowed to do that.
[03:35:42.220 --> 03:35:46.220]  That's expressing our First Amendment right now.
[03:35:46.220 --> 03:35:48.220]  It's not a boycott.
[03:35:48.220 --> 03:35:50.220]  That is mafia tactics.
[03:35:50.220 --> 03:35:53.220]  That is mob intimidation.
[03:35:53.220 --> 03:35:59.220]  Let me explain the difference to some confused people that don't understand what a boycott is
[03:35:59.220 --> 03:36:05.220]  and what absolute tyranny in silencing an opposing viewpoint is.
[03:36:05.220 --> 03:36:08.220]  If you want a boycott, Laura Ingram, here's what you do.
[03:36:08.220 --> 03:36:12.220]  You tell all your friends, you can make signs, you do whatever you want,
[03:36:12.220 --> 03:36:15.220]  and say, don't watch Laura Ingram's show.
[03:36:15.220 --> 03:36:18.220]  Once the ratings go down, the sponsors will say,
[03:36:18.220 --> 03:36:22.220]  we're not getting our money's worth because no one's watching the show
[03:36:22.220 --> 03:36:27.220]  and we will cancel our buys on that program.
[03:36:27.220 --> 03:36:28.220]  That is a boycott.
[03:36:28.220 --> 03:36:31.220]  That would be a boycott against Laura Ingram.
[03:36:31.220 --> 03:36:41.220]  Tyrannical mob tactics to silence opposition is calling, writing, going on social media,
[03:36:41.220 --> 03:36:48.220]  and intimidating the sponsors into canceling their buys on Laura Ingram,
[03:36:48.220 --> 03:36:53.220]  regardless of how well she's doing and how much of their money's worth
[03:36:53.220 --> 03:36:56.220]  they're actually getting from advertising on our show.
[03:36:56.220 --> 03:37:01.220]  The My Pillow guy, you think he goes, well, we're doing great.
[03:37:01.220 --> 03:37:02.220]  Let's look at Laura Ingram.
[03:37:02.220 --> 03:37:04.220]  Oh, yeah, wow, we're selling a lot of pillows.
[03:37:04.220 --> 03:37:06.220]  We're selling a lot of pillows.
[03:37:06.220 --> 03:37:09.220]  My pillow made in my home state of Minnesota.
[03:37:09.220 --> 03:37:14.220]  Laura Ingram's doing very well for us, but we'll pull the ads.
[03:37:14.220 --> 03:37:15.220]  He didn't mind you.
[03:37:15.220 --> 03:37:20.220]  He stuck a buyer, but they're trying to make people actually pull their ads
[03:37:20.220 --> 03:37:26.220]  based on nothing but the fact that she has an opposing viewpoint from them.
[03:37:26.220 --> 03:37:28.220]  That's mob tactics.
[03:37:28.220 --> 03:37:34.220]  That's exactly like Mafia walking into a store and saying, you need to pay us
[03:37:34.220 --> 03:37:36.220]  or there's going to be a problem.
[03:37:36.220 --> 03:37:41.220]  It's them saying you need to cancel your buys on this show
[03:37:41.220 --> 03:37:43.220]  or there's going to be a problem.
[03:37:43.220 --> 03:37:45.220]  That's not a boycott.
[03:37:45.220 --> 03:37:47.220]  You want to boycott Laura Ingram?
[03:37:47.220 --> 03:37:49.220]  Don't watch Laura Ingram.
[03:37:49.220 --> 03:37:51.220]  Well, your friend's not to watch her.
[03:37:51.220 --> 03:37:54.220]  That is an American thing to do.
[03:37:54.220 --> 03:37:57.220]  That's exercising your rights.
[03:37:57.220 --> 03:37:59.220]  Intimidation is not.
[03:37:59.220 --> 03:38:00.220]  That's different.
[03:38:00.220 --> 03:38:01.220]  A lot of people don't understand that.
[03:38:01.220 --> 03:38:03.220]  I've been called out plenty of times.
[03:38:03.220 --> 03:38:04.220]  It's a boycott.
[03:38:04.220 --> 03:38:05.220]  You're allowed to do it.
[03:38:05.220 --> 03:38:08.220]  No, it's not a boycott.
[03:38:08.220 --> 03:38:12.220]  We were talking about Mueller, the Mueller investigation,
[03:38:12.220 --> 03:38:16.220]  the Mueller circus sideshow.
[03:38:16.220 --> 03:38:18.220]  Who isn't seeing this?
[03:38:18.220 --> 03:38:21.220]  I don't have any special powers.
[03:38:21.220 --> 03:38:22.220]  Alex Jones.
[03:38:22.220 --> 03:38:24.220]  Well, Alex might have special powers.
[03:38:24.220 --> 03:38:25.220]  I'm not sure.
[03:38:25.220 --> 03:38:27.220]  But I don't think he does.
[03:38:27.220 --> 03:38:30.220]  But a lot of people can see what's going on.
[03:38:30.220 --> 03:38:32.220]  But a lot of people can't.
[03:38:32.220 --> 03:38:39.220]  I don't understand the hatred for Donald Trump is making people blind.
[03:38:39.220 --> 03:38:44.220]  You have to see that this investigation is a farce.
[03:38:44.220 --> 03:38:50.220]  They are in search of something to pin on Donald Trump.
[03:38:50.220 --> 03:38:54.220]  So that they can continue with some type of impeachment proceedings
[03:38:54.220 --> 03:39:00.220]  and remove a democratically elected president because they don't like him.
[03:39:00.220 --> 03:39:02.220]  They don't like what he stands for.
[03:39:02.220 --> 03:39:04.220]  They don't like the people that voted for him,
[03:39:04.220 --> 03:39:07.220]  which by the way are called Americans.
[03:39:07.220 --> 03:39:08.220]  That's right.
[03:39:08.220 --> 03:39:12.220]  Americans voted for Donald Trump.
[03:39:12.220 --> 03:39:16.220]  For the past eight years prior to Donald Trump,
[03:39:16.220 --> 03:39:20.220]  we had a president in office that a lot of people didn't like.
[03:39:20.220 --> 03:39:24.220]  There wasn't a concerted effort to remove him from office.
[03:39:24.220 --> 03:39:30.220]  There wasn't a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week hissy fit going on
[03:39:30.220 --> 03:39:34.220]  on mainstream media to have him removed.
[03:39:34.220 --> 03:39:35.220]  We didn't like it.
[03:39:35.220 --> 03:39:37.220]  We dealt with it as best we could.
[03:39:37.220 --> 03:39:39.220]  We voiced our opinions on it.
[03:39:39.220 --> 03:39:44.220]  And we accepted that he was going to be our president.
[03:39:44.220 --> 03:39:49.220]  The opposition to Donald Trump is not accepting that.
[03:39:49.220 --> 03:39:56.220]  And it seems to be a much bigger operation than just the liberals
[03:39:56.220 --> 03:40:01.220]  or Democrats or progressives disagreeing with the president.
[03:40:01.220 --> 03:40:03.220]  This goes a lot deeper.
[03:40:03.220 --> 03:40:09.220]  And I've never been one of these people that have looked much deeper
[03:40:09.220 --> 03:40:10.220]  than the surface.
[03:40:10.220 --> 03:40:17.220]  I had this naivete that I actually believed that a lot
[03:40:17.220 --> 03:40:19.220]  of what the government was telling me was the truth,
[03:40:19.220 --> 03:40:24.220]  that mainstream media, aside from a few things you had to sort out,
[03:40:24.220 --> 03:40:26.220]  was basically telling me the truth.
[03:40:26.220 --> 03:40:30.220]  The election of Donald Trump showed me and a lot of other people
[03:40:30.220 --> 03:40:32.220]  that that just is not so.
[03:40:32.220 --> 03:40:37.220]  And we are being fed a lot of disinformation.
[03:40:37.220 --> 03:40:39.220]  And there's a reason for it.
[03:40:39.220 --> 03:40:45.220]  There's a much more nefarious, evil reason why these things are going on.
[03:40:45.220 --> 03:40:50.220]  Why we see this Mueller investigation continuing month after month
[03:40:50.220 --> 03:40:54.220]  into what amounts to will be years.
[03:40:54.220 --> 03:40:57.220]  And they have not found a thing.
[03:40:57.220 --> 03:41:07.220]  They invade the right to lawyer, client privilege
[03:41:07.220 --> 03:41:12.220]  and raid the office of Donald Trump's lawyer looking for,
[03:41:12.220 --> 03:41:16.220]  looking for, we don't know.
[03:41:16.220 --> 03:41:18.220]  Last I heard they were looking for something that had to do
[03:41:18.220 --> 03:41:21.220]  with the access Hollywood tape.
[03:41:21.220 --> 03:41:23.220]  Remember that one?
[03:41:23.220 --> 03:41:26.220]  They actually were looking for something like that.
[03:41:26.220 --> 03:41:28.220]  What's on the warrant?
[03:41:28.220 --> 03:41:30.220]  I want to know what's on that warrant.
[03:41:30.220 --> 03:41:32.220]  What are they looking for?
[03:41:32.220 --> 03:41:36.220]  What huge thing took them over a year to finally decide,
[03:41:36.220 --> 03:41:41.220]  hey, we need to bust open the door of Trump's lawyer
[03:41:41.220 --> 03:41:45.220]  and rifle through privileged information.
[03:41:45.220 --> 03:41:48.220]  Well, I tell you something, you better have something good.
[03:41:48.220 --> 03:41:52.220]  And I can't imagine they do because we haven't heard anything
[03:41:52.220 --> 03:41:56.220]  in over a year of this investigation.
[03:41:56.220 --> 03:42:00.220]  We have not heard one thing that attaches Donald Trump
[03:42:00.220 --> 03:42:05.220]  to some type of Russian collusion, whatever the hell that is.
[03:42:05.220 --> 03:42:10.220]  But we're hearing about porn stars and the fact that Donald Trump
[03:42:10.220 --> 03:42:15.220]  was unfaithful and like Alex said at the top of this hour,
[03:42:15.220 --> 03:42:17.220]  we knew this.
[03:42:17.220 --> 03:42:19.220]  This isn't a surprise.
[03:42:19.220 --> 03:42:24.220]  We're from voting for Donald Trump and having him legally elected
[03:42:24.220 --> 03:42:27.220]  as the president of the United States of America.
[03:42:27.220 --> 03:42:28.220]  We didn't care.
[03:42:28.220 --> 03:42:30.220]  We just wanted the country to be better.
[03:42:30.220 --> 03:42:35.220]  And he's an outsider and he's in their game and they don't like it
[03:42:35.220 --> 03:42:40.220]  and they're trying to have him remove because that's what they do.
[03:42:40.220 --> 03:42:42.220]  He's not business as usual.
[03:42:42.220 --> 03:42:45.220]  He's not one of the boys and they're not happy with that
[03:42:45.220 --> 03:42:48.220]  and we have to see where they're going.
[03:42:48.220 --> 03:42:50.220]  This is a dangerous place.
[03:42:50.220 --> 03:42:53.220]  Be back in moments.
[03:42:53.220 --> 03:42:55.220]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:42:55.220 --> 03:42:57.220]  And I make it really easy.
[03:42:57.220 --> 03:43:00.220]  We went out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are
[03:43:00.220 --> 03:43:04.220]  that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[03:43:04.220 --> 03:43:08.220]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas
[03:43:08.220 --> 03:43:09.220]  out there.
[03:43:09.220 --> 03:43:10.220]  It's very simple.
[03:43:10.220 --> 03:43:12.220]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[03:43:12.220 --> 03:43:13.220]  We'll just put even more product in.
[03:43:13.220 --> 03:43:14.220]  We'll make it better.
[03:43:14.220 --> 03:43:17.220]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[03:43:17.220 --> 03:43:20.220]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[03:43:20.220 --> 03:43:22.220]  It's $19.95 right now.
[03:43:22.220 --> 03:43:27.220]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new tropic for $19.95.
[03:43:27.220 --> 03:43:29.220]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[03:43:29.220 --> 03:43:31.220]  We need that $15, $20.
[03:43:31.220 --> 03:43:34.220]  We make the fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it.
[03:43:34.220 --> 03:43:37.220]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[03:43:37.220 --> 03:43:40.220]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in
[03:43:40.220 --> 03:43:44.220]  and I want people that haven't tried Brainforce to try it and find out why.
[03:43:44.220 --> 03:43:47.220]  It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews.
[03:43:47.220 --> 03:43:48.220]  It's amazing.
[03:43:48.220 --> 03:44:14.220]  It's amazing.
[03:44:14.220 --> 03:44:40.220]  It's amazing.
[03:44:40.220 --> 03:45:06.220]  It's amazing.
[03:45:06.220 --> 03:45:35.220]  It's amazing.
[03:45:35.220 --> 03:45:50.220]  It's amazing.
[03:45:50.220 --> 03:46:16.220]  It's amazing.
[03:46:16.220 --> 03:46:42.220]  It's amazing.
[03:46:42.220 --> 03:47:11.220]  It's amazing.
[03:47:11.220 --> 03:47:15.220]  News, Analysis, Reports.
[03:47:15.220 --> 03:47:18.220]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:18.220 --> 03:47:26.220]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:47:26.220 --> 03:47:27.220]  Welcome.
[03:47:27.220 --> 03:47:28.220]  Welcome back.
[03:47:28.220 --> 03:47:30.220]  Anthony Cumia, infoforce.com.
[03:47:30.220 --> 03:47:38.220]  There's just so much speculation as to what the hell is going on with this country.
[03:47:38.220 --> 03:47:46.220]  We've heard from Alex this war that globalists are waging on this country.
[03:47:46.220 --> 03:47:51.220]  The way it's being torn apart from the inside out.
[03:47:51.220 --> 03:47:55.220]  We don't look at ourselves as Americans anymore.
[03:47:55.220 --> 03:48:00.220]  We hear all the time, diversity is our greatest strength.
[03:48:00.220 --> 03:48:05.220]  All you see are people that resent each other for their diversity.
[03:48:05.220 --> 03:48:14.220]  We don't have American values anymore that seem to have held us together for so many years.
[03:48:14.220 --> 03:48:25.220]  No matter what we disagreed on for 200 years or so before it really started getting a little freight around the edges,
[03:48:25.220 --> 03:48:31.220]  we at least looked at ourselves that we had a commonality of being Americans.
[03:48:31.220 --> 03:48:32.220]  That's gone.
[03:48:32.220 --> 03:48:33.220]  It's just gone.
[03:48:33.220 --> 03:48:40.220]  There doesn't seem to be that common thread that holds us together as Americans anymore.
[03:48:40.220 --> 03:48:47.220]  There's so many different groups and factions and just because you practice a different religion,
[03:48:47.220 --> 03:48:52.220]  that means you can't accept or respect another person.
[03:48:52.220 --> 03:48:59.220]  And again, without that commonality of just being Americans, the whole thing falls apart.
[03:48:59.220 --> 03:49:05.220]  I was watching an amazing documentary the other night on the Roosevelt's.
[03:49:05.220 --> 03:49:08.220]  Now, regardless of how you feel about their politics and whatnot,
[03:49:08.220 --> 03:49:15.220]  it was just the presidency and what led up to it of Teddy Roosevelt.
[03:49:15.220 --> 03:49:23.220]  Very early 1900s, from the 1800s into the 1900s, a very pivotal time in American history.
[03:49:23.220 --> 03:49:33.220]  It's fascinating because this is a guy, you won't find more of a man's man than Teddy Roosevelt.
[03:49:33.220 --> 03:49:37.220]  And what the things he believed in, and again, I'm not just talking politically.
[03:49:37.220 --> 03:49:46.220]  I'm saying the things he believed in, country, family, the rights of a man to be a man.
[03:49:46.220 --> 03:49:55.220]  After his wife and mother died on the same day, he just picked up, put on a cowboy hat and went out west
[03:49:55.220 --> 03:50:01.220]  and just spent time alone in the wilderness getting his head back together
[03:50:01.220 --> 03:50:09.220]  and assessing himself, his country, his place in this great nation.
[03:50:09.220 --> 03:50:19.220]  And it really struck me that in a little over 100 years of this country's existence from that time on,
[03:50:19.220 --> 03:50:22.220]  just has fallen apart.
[03:50:22.220 --> 03:50:28.220]  No one cares anymore about America and being American.
[03:50:28.220 --> 03:50:32.220]  It's a bad word. It's a bad word now.
[03:50:32.220 --> 03:50:39.220]  It's some type of either your racist or your white supremacist or an imperialist.
[03:50:39.220 --> 03:50:50.220]  And years ago, when America was an amazing, great place, it was looked at as a thing of pride.
[03:50:50.220 --> 03:50:57.220]  And when you spoke about it, other people got on board and talked also about how wonderful it was,
[03:50:57.220 --> 03:51:03.220]  the opportunity and just the amazing place to raise a family.
[03:51:03.220 --> 03:51:10.220]  You look at someone like Teddy Roosevelt now, he wouldn't be able to speak on a college campus
[03:51:10.220 --> 03:51:18.220]  because he would be talking about war and glory and shooting animals.
[03:51:18.220 --> 03:51:23.220]  He would be labeled toxic masculinity.
[03:51:23.220 --> 03:51:31.220]  They've actually come up with something, a slur against a man being a man.
[03:51:31.220 --> 03:51:35.220]  We're not allowed anymore to find women attractive.
[03:51:35.220 --> 03:51:42.220]  The basic thing that keeps human beings repopulating the earth,
[03:51:42.220 --> 03:51:46.220]  the fact that men will find women attractive.
[03:51:46.220 --> 03:51:49.220]  It's now a bad thing.
[03:51:49.220 --> 03:51:57.220]  An instinct that has been ingrained in human beings for millennia and it's a bad thing now.
[03:51:57.220 --> 03:52:04.220]  They label that and they make sure, oh boy, do they make sure they spread it around the schools.
[03:52:04.220 --> 03:52:07.220]  Get them while they're young.
[03:52:07.220 --> 03:52:13.220]  Tell them about gender fluidity and toxic masculinity and feminism
[03:52:13.220 --> 03:52:20.220]  and all the things that rip us apart.
[03:52:20.220 --> 03:52:23.220]  To anger a conservative, lie to him.
[03:52:23.220 --> 03:52:28.220]  To anger a liberal, tell him the truth. Theodore Roosevelt.
[03:52:28.220 --> 03:52:39.220]  If you get the opportunity, man, I tell you, watch it because I honestly believe the best way to try to see where we're going as a nation
[03:52:39.220 --> 03:52:44.220]  is to look at where we've been and what worked, what didn't work.
[03:52:44.220 --> 03:52:48.220]  Believe me, I don't see any new geniuses coming up.
[03:52:48.220 --> 03:52:53.220]  We get new technology and whatnot that winds up biting us in the ass anyway.
[03:52:53.220 --> 03:52:55.220]  But we get new technology.
[03:52:55.220 --> 03:53:06.220]  There's some new ideas and research, new medicines, but I'm not seeing any new ideas as far as how men are supposed to be men
[03:53:06.220 --> 03:53:11.220]  and how we're supposed to, what's good for a country, what's bad for a country.
[03:53:11.220 --> 03:53:15.220]  These are all basic things that have been in place and still work.
[03:53:15.220 --> 03:53:18.220]  So you look back in time and you see what worked and what didn't work
[03:53:18.220 --> 03:53:27.220]  and all the things that seem to have worked are now horrible things to the progressive left.
[03:53:27.220 --> 03:53:31.220]  They do not like families, traditional families.
[03:53:31.220 --> 03:53:42.220]  They don't like people having unification in anything and especially, like I said, in country.
[03:53:42.220 --> 03:53:47.220]  Trying to take away basic rights, the top 10.
[03:53:47.220 --> 03:53:52.220]  They're trying to infringe upon every one of them.
[03:53:52.220 --> 03:54:02.220]  And we see people talking about the Second Amendment a lot. I am just a staunch advocate of our Second Amendment right.
[03:54:02.220 --> 03:54:08.220]  It prevents many evils and we see what's happening and we're being compared to other nations.
[03:54:08.220 --> 03:54:15.220]  We're told what an amazing place America is, what an amazing unique country we are
[03:54:15.220 --> 03:54:19.220]  and in some ways we cannot be compared to other nations.
[03:54:19.220 --> 03:54:24.220]  And then as far as the gun issue goes, all people want to do is compare us to other nations.
[03:54:24.220 --> 03:54:30.220]  Well, the things that make us very unique in this country, freedoms that we have,
[03:54:30.220 --> 03:54:38.220]  the freedoms that we have to make ourselves great are also the same freedoms that people have to be idiots,
[03:54:38.220 --> 03:54:48.220]  to be stupid, to be reckless, because those same freedoms that we cherish can be used for evil things.
[03:54:48.220 --> 03:54:53.220]  And that's why you can't compare America to any other place.
[03:54:53.220 --> 03:54:58.220]  The United Kingdom is now having a London, is having this horrible knife problem.
[03:54:58.220 --> 03:55:03.220]  Apparently, without guns, people go around stabbing each other.
[03:55:03.220 --> 03:55:06.220]  So it has nothing to do with the weapon itself.
[03:55:06.220 --> 03:55:10.220]  And I've heard in the past many times, especially when you have a mass shooting,
[03:55:10.220 --> 03:55:16.220]  the argument is always, hey, what about if other people were armed, good people with guns were armed
[03:55:16.220 --> 03:55:19.220]  and we get the same scenario from the left.
[03:55:19.220 --> 03:55:24.220]  It'd be the Wild West. It's going to be this crazy shootout.
[03:55:24.220 --> 03:55:27.220]  People with guns will just start shooting everybody.
[03:55:27.220 --> 03:55:30.220]  You're like, oh, really? We're just innately murderers that want to kill?
[03:55:30.220 --> 03:55:32.220]  Well, I don't, yes, it's crazy.
[03:55:32.220 --> 03:55:35.220]  All right, then the UK now wants people to give up their knives.
[03:55:35.220 --> 03:55:38.220]  They say that only cowards carry knives.
[03:55:38.220 --> 03:55:44.220]  They actually, the mayor actually said, Mayor of London, there's no reason to carry a knife.
[03:55:44.220 --> 03:55:46.220]  There's plenty of reasons to carry a knife.
[03:55:46.220 --> 03:55:48.220]  My biggest point is this.
[03:55:48.220 --> 03:55:54.220]  If we are all maniacs that can't be trusted with weapons in a room full of strangers,
[03:55:54.220 --> 03:55:58.220]  that we would all of a sudden it would turn into the Wild West and we'd start killing each other,
[03:55:58.220 --> 03:56:03.220]  the most dangerous place to be in London would be a restaurant.
[03:56:03.220 --> 03:56:11.220]  It's literally a room full of strangers where every man, woman and child is in possession of a knife.
[03:56:11.220 --> 03:56:21.220]  That should be the most dangerous place because people can't be expected to not just pick up the knives
[03:56:21.220 --> 03:56:23.220]  and start killing each other.
[03:56:23.220 --> 03:56:25.220]  We would do it with guns. That's what we're told.
[03:56:25.220 --> 03:56:31.220]  If you put a bunch of strangers in a room and everyone's armed, it's going to turn into the Wild West.
[03:56:31.220 --> 03:56:35.220]  But for some reason we can sit peacefully with strangers and eat.
[03:56:35.220 --> 03:56:41.220]  When we are all armed with what is apparently the most dangerous item in London, the knife,
[03:56:41.220 --> 03:56:49.220]  and we somehow, somehow keep it together and don't just go stabbing each other.
[03:56:49.220 --> 03:56:55.220]  This might lead a sane person to believe it has nothing to do with the weaponry.
[03:56:55.220 --> 03:56:58.220]  It has nothing to do with the weapons themselves.
[03:56:58.220 --> 03:57:02.220]  There are bad people who will do bad things.
[03:57:02.220 --> 03:57:07.220]  And I don't know what planet you're from if you believe that could be changed.
[03:57:07.220 --> 03:57:13.220]  Because that is another thing that has been ingrained in us and in some people for millennia.
[03:57:13.220 --> 03:57:17.220]  Just like the fact that men will love looking at attractive women,
[03:57:17.220 --> 03:57:22.220]  even people that want to be president of the United States of America.
[03:57:22.220 --> 03:57:30.220]  I am Anthony Comey. You can check me out on compoundmedia.com with a wonderful Artie Lang.
[03:57:30.220 --> 03:57:35.220]  I want to thank everyone at InfoWars.com, especially Alex Jones.
[03:57:35.220 --> 03:57:42.220]  I love the guy, you know, big fan for years and it's a very special treat for me to be on InfoWars.com.
[03:57:42.220 --> 03:57:43.220]  We'll see you next time.
[03:57:43.220 --> 03:57:49.220]  InfoWars Life Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by Leafson Mounds and for a good reason.
[03:57:49.220 --> 03:57:53.220]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling new tropics were,
[03:57:53.220 --> 03:57:57.220]  what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[03:57:57.220 --> 03:58:02.220]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[03:58:02.220 --> 03:58:06.220]  We only have 150 percent. Then it helps funder operation.
[03:58:06.220 --> 03:58:12.220]  Well, now it's 50 percent off. That means we've got a 25 percent markup.
[03:58:12.220 --> 03:58:17.220]  And we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[03:58:17.220 --> 03:58:19.220]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[03:58:19.220 --> 03:58:22.220]  But the two go together. It's the mind and body challenge.
[03:58:22.220 --> 03:58:32.220]  They're both 50 percent off individually or together they're 50 percent off and free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:58:32.220 --> 03:58:37.220]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers are about to sell out.
[03:58:37.220 --> 03:58:43.220]  InfoWarsLife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and real red pill today.
[03:58:43.220 --> 03:58:49.220]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an InfoWars Life.
[03:58:49.220 --> 03:58:54.220]  It takes hours. Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger.
[03:58:54.220 --> 03:58:59.220]  It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the Candida.
[03:58:59.220 --> 03:59:03.220]  It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:59:03.220 --> 03:59:07.220]  It's got the preglonone. That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[03:59:07.220 --> 03:59:10.220]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[03:59:10.220 --> 03:59:11.220]  So you can upload it.
[03:59:11.220 --> 03:59:17.220]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified toothpaste
[03:59:17.220 --> 03:59:21.220]  is super blue silver immune gargle that's a spray you do.
[03:59:21.220 --> 03:59:22.220]  You can also swallow it.
[03:59:22.220 --> 03:59:27.220]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[03:59:27.220 --> 03:59:29.220]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[03:59:29.220 --> 03:59:35.220]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsLife.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake,
[03:59:35.220 --> 03:59:39.220]  but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:59:39.220 --> 03:59:51.220]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
