[00:00:05.026 --> 00:00:09.848]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:11.449]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.010]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.192]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:21.254]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:44.624]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:44.624 --> 00:00:49.068]  It is already Thursday, the fourth day of March 2010.
[00:00:49.068 --> 00:00:53.431]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:58.155]  We've got Larry Pratt joining us for 30 minutes in the next hour, the head of Gun Owners of America.
[00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:13.419]  He's going to be on the radio broadcast with us discussing the Supreme Court ruling that's upcoming that many say will extend Second Amendment rights, now those are God-given, to the states.
[00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:21.981]  The problem is, in their closing arguments, court watchers reported that most of the justices agreed it would be a restriction on rights.
[00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.042]  You have a right for us to take your guns.
[00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:24.762]  You have a right
[00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:48.634]  to hand your guns and us yes you have a right you can jump through a hundred flaming hoops when there's a blue moon and stand on top of the highest mountain in the world uh... while standing on one leg uh... blowing soap bubbles if you can do that you may be able to have a gun locked up in a big safe in your house if you say pretty please we are the government we're coming for you
[00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.820]  And so we're going to be breaking that down today.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:03.724]  I got Jason Burmas popping in for about 15 minutes after Pratt to really walk through this cyber security bill because the mainstream media, only in a few places, has reported just how bad this is.
[00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:07.725]  And I want people to know what's set to pass the Senate, it's already passed the House.
[00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:10.006]  And then Congressman Ron Paul joins us.
[00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:18.249]  Boy, there's a lot to talk about with him today on this fourth day of March 2010.
[00:02:21.664 --> 00:02:24.946]  You know, all the time, things just hit me.
[00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:26.787]  They just hit me.
[00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:35.092]  It's something you already instinctively knew, that you'd thought about, that you understood, but then it just hits you just how bad it really is.
[00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:48.000]  Every day I see articles in Europe, the United States, and England, all run by the same bureaucratic system, where if you yell at your kids, or your wife, or your husband, they take your kids, or you go to jail.
[00:02:51.278 --> 00:02:58.065]  And I see reports all the time where families now are being arrested for developing film of their children in bathing suits.
[00:02:58.065 --> 00:03:01.709]  That's now child pornography.
[00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:09.076]  And I see articles where then violent sex offenders, real rapists, are released.
[00:03:09.076 --> 00:03:14.302]  And then I see articles where different states are passing laws where you can't have burglar bars on your house, like Oklahoma.
[00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:18.580]  How does all that tie together in a report like this one today?
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.261]  Pupils age 5 on hate register.
[00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:27.424]  Teachers must log playground taunts for government database.
[00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:30.505]  See, criminals run the government.
[00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:35.428]  And so they are writing the laws and the regulations where everyone is a criminal.
[00:03:35.428 --> 00:03:36.889]  Everyone gets in the database.
[00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.510]  Everyone is going to basically be on probation.
[00:03:41.334 --> 00:03:42.735]  And they've tripled the number of cops.
[00:03:42.735 --> 00:03:44.836]  They're just going to triple them again, over and over again.
[00:03:44.836 --> 00:03:51.219]  And it's going to be a hellish system of bureaucrats, social workers, police, sucking off of everyone.
[00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:52.640]  I was listening to local talk radio.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.002]  It's what triggered this chain of events in my mind.
[00:03:57.002 --> 00:04:01.284]  High risk sex offender warning, South Austin neighborhood on alert.
[00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:03.926]  And it says he's a high risk.
[00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:05.647]  So why did they release him?
[00:04:05.647 --> 00:04:07.147]  And it says when he was 23, he raped a 16 year old.
[00:04:09.175 --> 00:04:10.956]  They don't say whether it was consensual or not.
[00:04:10.956 --> 00:04:14.357]  If you're 18 and the person's 17, it's rape.
[00:04:14.357 --> 00:04:16.878]  It's statutory.
[00:04:16.878 --> 00:04:23.580]  But then I heard all these callers calling in, talking about how, well, I was 13, or I was 14, or I was 15, had a girlfriend.
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.341]  Well, how old was she?
[00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:26.702]  Well, she was the same age as me.
[00:04:26.702 --> 00:04:29.003]  Oh, well, you're still a sex offender.
[00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:32.404]  And it triggered my memory of all the articles I've seen
[00:04:33.527 --> 00:04:33.667]  I'm
[00:04:51.616 --> 00:04:55.161]  I mean, most of the cops arresting you for this were doing this when they were 16, 17.
[00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:57.264]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:04:57.264 --> 00:04:58.225]  But they don't care!
[00:04:58.225 --> 00:05:00.448]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.448 --> 00:05:01.589]  What's your home worth?
[00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:03.712]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:06.416]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:05:06.736 --> 00:05:14.442]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of the tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[00:05:32.014 --> 00:05:32.514]  Let's do it!
[00:06:02.023 --> 00:06:06.071]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.071 --> 00:06:09.298]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.298 --> 00:06:10.720]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:06:11.408 --> 00:06:14.090]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.476]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.476 --> 00:06:25.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:35.668]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.788 --> 00:06:38.110]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.711]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:42.173]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.173 --> 00:06:44.315]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.315 --> 00:06:49.439]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:39.285]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:07:39.285 --> 00:07:46.348]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:07:46.348 --> 00:07:50.270]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.410]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.112]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:07:57.433 --> 00:08:02.075]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:08:02.075 --> 00:08:08.699]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:11.680]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.025 --> 00:08:14.968]  Big Brother.
[00:08:14.968 --> 00:08:16.011]  The Man.
[00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:17.676]  The Federales.
[00:08:17.676 --> 00:08:19.361]  The Sacred Police.
[00:08:19.361 --> 00:08:20.123]  The Parasite.
[00:08:21.721 --> 00:08:23.862]  Control Grid wants you in the system.
[00:08:23.862 --> 00:08:25.062]  They want to get you on welfare.
[00:08:25.062 --> 00:08:27.723]  They want to get you in the psychiatric system.
[00:08:27.723 --> 00:08:29.563]  They want to get you into the government system.
[00:08:29.563 --> 00:08:31.964]  They want you under their thumb.
[00:08:31.964 --> 00:08:40.166]  We are all being socially engineered, scientifically brainwashed, balkanized, manipulated.
[00:08:40.166 --> 00:08:45.848]  And this radio show, if it does anything, seeks to get people to look at the bigger picture.
[00:08:47.037 --> 00:08:55.482]  And to understand who controls this planet and the very destructive, dangerous direction they are taking us in.
[00:08:55.482 --> 00:09:04.046]  I have a big stack of news from the states and the federal government announcing literally scores of new taxes a day.
[00:09:04.046 --> 00:09:13.031]  I mean, I've got probably more than 10 articles here in the stack, I didn't count them, that are about horrible new taxes on basically everything.
[00:09:14.841 --> 00:09:36.895]  And the country's going bankrupt, the people are going bankrupt, and government's just growing, growing, growing, growing, and the Republicans are positioning themselves as our saviors, and they're gonna get back in power in the next few years, and then they're gonna betray everybody, and then the Democrats will get back in power, and the same cycle over and over again, same thing in every other Western nation.
[00:09:36.895 --> 00:09:40.797]  There is no doubt we are sliding into bonafide tyranny.
[00:09:40.797 --> 00:09:42.258]  And it is a scientific tyranny.
[00:09:46.238 --> 00:09:50.860]  All over the Western world, the exact same initiatives are being implemented.
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:10:04.066]  Where if one of your parents was ever on welfare or ever was given a learning disability, the CPS takes your children in Canada and in England and now in the United States.
[00:10:04.066 --> 00:10:06.027]  I see it in the news every day.
[00:10:06.027 --> 00:10:07.607]  They just come take your children.
[00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:11.829]  They come take your firstborn child.
[00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:15.571]  They are trying to pass laws and hundreds of cities have already done it in England.
[00:10:18.041 --> 00:10:19.122]  It's the EU doing it.
[00:10:19.122 --> 00:10:26.847]  They come in and finance the local city councils, the townships, because they can't get the parliament to pass national laws.
[00:10:26.847 --> 00:10:33.271]  Where for parents to be in public with their children, they have to register with the government and prove they're not a sex offender.
[00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:35.492]  That doesn't mean they have to prove they were never arrested.
[00:10:35.492 --> 00:10:38.574]  It means they have to go get a license to be with their children in public.
[00:10:39.824 --> 00:11:00.615]  Here in the United States and in England, we see articles every week where someone will take their sons and daughters to an ice skating rink or to one of those video game arcade areas for their kids to play and they'll take an iPhone shot of them and the police will come arrest them saying, are you a pedophile?
[00:11:00.615 --> 00:11:01.896]  It just goes on and on.
[00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:13.799]  In my film Endgame, this is three and a half years ago, I put mainstream news articles in there from England, where if you ever had a parent who was convicted of any crime, then it's eugenics.
[00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:24.127]  They say that means you have criminal genetics, and at birth you're put in a criminal database, and at age two you go on parole and start being interviewed by the social workers.
[00:11:26.068 --> 00:11:29.530]  A total 1984 scenario.
[00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.552]  And here's one today from the Mail, the Daily Mail.
[00:11:32.552 --> 00:11:35.194]  Pupils age 5 on hate register.
[00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:38.576]  Teachers must log playground taunts for government database.
[00:11:38.576 --> 00:11:41.938]  All in the name of keeping everyone safe.
[00:11:41.938 --> 00:11:46.460]  Meanwhile, the government can taser, shoot, kill, beat, attack whoever they want.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.683]  The government teaches their attack dogs to be more vicious, to be hateful towards the public.
[00:11:51.683 --> 00:11:52.444]  That's all fine.
[00:11:53.274 --> 00:11:56.537]  But if you yell at your wife or yell at your husband, they're going to take your kids.
[00:11:56.537 --> 00:12:00.640]  Or if you take a photo of your child at the park, they're going to try to take your kids.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.483]  Or, I see this every few weeks.
[00:12:03.483 --> 00:12:16.434]  The famous Arizona case last year got a lot of attention, where it was the children in towels, what, ages two and three, two girls, hugging each other.
[00:12:16.434 --> 00:12:16.734]  And they
[00:12:18.424 --> 00:12:20.005]  Took their kids.
[00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:41.294]  I saw an article a month ago where a man in, highly decorated, in Afghanistan, his wife sent him a photo of his daughter playing in a baby pool in a bikini, aged three, and they arrested him, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:43.295]  I mean, let me explain this.
[00:12:45.922 --> 00:12:47.183]  It's just off the charts.
[00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:48.123]  It's off the charts.
[00:12:48.123 --> 00:13:08.931]  And I've seen a lot of news articles, and then I heard Local Talk Radio covering it this morning, but saying it was a good thing, that if you're 15, 16, or 17, and you have a sweetheart in high school, and you guys get in the back of the back seat of the car, and have sex, which is what human beings do, I'm not saying it's a good thing,
[00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:11.534]  I mean, I think absences is good.
[00:13:11.534 --> 00:13:13.956]  There's a lot of diseases out there.
[00:13:13.956 --> 00:13:15.438]  There's so much abortion going on.
[00:13:15.438 --> 00:13:16.599]  People abort these babies.
[00:13:16.599 --> 00:13:19.821]  So I'm not saying it's a good thing, but it is natural.
[00:13:19.821 --> 00:13:22.043]  I mean, it's normal.
[00:13:22.043 --> 00:13:24.345]  In the pioneer days, the average age for people to get married was 15.
[00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:30.571]  You know, you're of age in Israel when you're 13.
[00:13:30.571 --> 00:13:34.754]  The whole issue here is that many of our founding fathers were married at 15, 16, 17.
[00:13:36.929 --> 00:13:48.919]  The point is they tell us we're children now until we're 18, they're trying to push it up to 20, and whereas I think it is good for people to wait until they get married, because, I mean, I've been down that road.
[00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:53.503]  You know, when I was in high school and college, I was very promiscuous.
[00:13:53.503 --> 00:13:56.145]  I mean, you couldn't keep me away from the cheerleaders and you couldn't keep them away from me.
[00:13:57.165 --> 00:13:59.086]  I mean, it looked good and it was good.
[00:13:59.086 --> 00:14:06.591]  But the whole point is, is that I wish now, in hindsight, I would have never done the things I did.
[00:14:06.591 --> 00:14:08.973]  Because overall, it's destructive.
[00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.954]  And it's bad.
[00:14:10.954 --> 00:14:17.298]  And I learned many years later, without me knowing, that I had a girlfriend who had an abortion.
[00:14:17.298 --> 00:14:18.078]  Absolutely.
[00:14:18.078 --> 00:14:21.901]  And the way my family was at the time, we would have known, but no, they kept it secret.
[00:14:22.902 --> 00:14:33.860]  And look, the issue here is it's so hypocritical, and they know it's hypocritical, that we have national statistics from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
[00:14:35.535 --> 00:14:42.720]  Showing promiscuous behavior in boys at 53% and girls at 50%.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:49.444]  And I've seen some numbers, because some of them aren't truthful, and they tend to think it's even higher than that because a lot of people will lie.
[00:14:49.444 --> 00:14:54.367]  And this was a percentage of 9th and 12th graders, through 9th and 12th grade, who've had sexual intercourse.
[00:14:55.564 --> 00:14:58.206]  That's not even counting other forms of sex.
[00:14:58.206 --> 00:15:03.651]  A lot of the youth in studies don't think that oral sex is sex, but it certainly is.
[00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:06.773]  And that's as high as 80% in some of the polls I've seen.
[00:15:06.773 --> 00:15:15.000]  So, half of the high schoolers in this country are sex offenders, according to the government.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.161]  And they ruin their lives.
[00:15:17.161 --> 00:15:22.165]  And how many cops listening out there, how many of you in high school had sex?
[00:15:22.165 --> 00:15:22.766]  More than half.
[00:15:24.212 --> 00:15:26.813]  How many, and the other half, I bet you wish you would have.
[00:15:26.813 --> 00:15:31.536]  You were sure trying, weren't you?
[00:15:31.536 --> 00:15:38.699]  I mean, I remember being 13, 14 and hearing, you know, my friend's older brother talking about their girlfriends and I was like, this sounds awfully good.
[00:15:38.699 --> 00:15:48.904]  I mean, this is amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:48.904 --> 00:15:52.046]  I mean, when you've got two year old
[00:15:53.932 --> 00:15:59.916]  Or 14-month-old, say, German Shepherds, and they get together in the backyard and do something.
[00:15:59.916 --> 00:16:03.299]  I mean, do you send them to jail for it?
[00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:04.580]  No.
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:10.544]  Well, humans, 14, 15, 16, 17, I mean, all I was thinking about was girls.
[00:16:10.544 --> 00:16:12.926]  That's all that was ever on my mind, sitting there in class.
[00:16:17.082 --> 00:16:44.636]  It's amazing, but according to this government and this system, every, and I heard these talk show hosts, this guy called in and was even, you know, brainwashed and saying, yes, I'm guilty, you know, I was a teenager and she was the same age and, you know, we got convicted of this and then I pulled up some articles and confirmed my memory that all over the country, tens of thousands of cases a year now, where 17-year-olds, seniors in high school,
[00:16:47.682 --> 00:16:55.508]  Get caught at the park in the back of the car, the back of the truck, and they go to jail.
[00:16:55.508 --> 00:16:57.930]  The cops arrest them, throw the book at them.
[00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:07.898]  When those cops doing that, guaranteed did the exact same thing.
[00:17:07.898 --> 00:17:09.640]  So see, this is what tyranny is.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.122]  It takes normal behavior that is natural,
[00:17:14.286 --> 00:17:15.847]  And they make it a crime.
[00:17:15.847 --> 00:17:29.877]  And then separately, I see the articles every day, there's one here in the Statesman today, and another one from KXAN, where they'll take a violent rapist, who rapes a 16 year old girl when they're 22,
[00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:40.340]  Or, you know, we see these reports constantly of some 50-year-old degenerate pedophile who's raped a four-year-old and then they're out in five years.
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:52.511]  So, see, they're letting them go, the real perverts, the people that are unnatural, the people that are predators, the people that are dangerous, the people a lot of times that kill kids they grab, and they let them go.
[00:17:52.511 --> 00:17:53.392]  They let them go.
[00:17:53.392 --> 00:17:56.074]  And that makes me very, very angry.
[00:17:56.917 --> 00:18:04.083]  And then they take natural activity and make it highly illegal.
[00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:05.024]  And it gets worse and worse.
[00:18:05.024 --> 00:18:10.829]  You know, 10 years ago, they'd take an 18-year-old guy who was a senior, and he'd have a 17-year-old girlfriend.
[00:18:10.829 --> 00:18:17.214]  You've seen all the reports of the football players getting busted and things, because usually people are jealous of them, so they report, yeah.
[00:18:17.214 --> 00:18:23.420]  And then the cheerleader gets pregnant, and the police come and arrest the guy, instead of the family going, okay, you guys get married.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.561]  Wow, this is a great blessing.
[00:18:25.717 --> 00:18:27.499]  Better get to work, boy.
[00:18:27.499 --> 00:18:30.583]  Better get into the factory and get to work now.
[00:18:30.583 --> 00:18:31.965]  Not gonna be college for you now.
[00:18:31.965 --> 00:18:35.890]  You gotta go right to work.
[00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:42.018]  I mean, how many people... How many people do you know who had babies in high school?
[00:18:42.018 --> 00:18:42.399]  A lot.
[00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:51.734]  I had a lot of friends who got married in high school because their families were Christian and they had the baby, and they're business owners and happy today, but they tell you that's bad.
[00:18:51.734 --> 00:18:55.775]  No, you gotta have an abortion, number one, and you gotta go to jail.
[00:18:55.775 --> 00:19:01.076]  That's right, you gotta go to jail for this.
[00:19:01.076 --> 00:19:12.300]  I mean, how many of those judges up there sending 16-year-old men and women to prison for consensual intercourse did the exact same thing when they were in high school?
[00:19:14.476 --> 00:19:32.573]  Then you got the feminists in all these books they write saying all sex is rape, all men are rapists, and that the act is bad for women, and it's all about destroying the family, breaking down basic human society so the state can absorb the family, and that's in all the big government textbooks and reports.
[00:19:32.573 --> 00:19:34.555]  This is so evil.
[00:19:34.555 --> 00:19:37.018]  And then we'll get into the rest of the story when we come back.
[00:19:38.732 --> 00:19:43.056]  The UN, DynCorp, Halliburton, all in the news, above the law.
[00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:49.201]  I could play congressional hearings for you where they admit they kidnapped small children for the sex trade and don't get in trouble.
[00:19:49.201 --> 00:19:55.666]  So grabbing somebody's five-year-old daughter out of their front lawn and taking them off to a slave camp, that's fine for the government.
[00:19:55.666 --> 00:19:59.970]  But you're 17, have a 17-year-old girlfriend, you're going to prison, you're a sex offender for the rest of your life.
[00:20:01.064 --> 00:20:06.751]  Lose one to two pounds a day the healthy way and keep it off with the help of the entire real HCG diet.

[00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:38.270]  We're good.
[00:21:00.785 --> 00:21:01.845]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:06.806]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:06.806 --> 00:21:14.868]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:14.868 --> 00:21:20.449]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.449 --> 00:21:27.411]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:33.313]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:33.313 --> 00:21:38.394]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:38.394 --> 00:21:46.337]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:46.337 --> 00:21:49.018]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[00:21:49.478 --> 00:21:52.881]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:52.881 --> 00:21:54.062]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.062 --> 00:21:54.282]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.282 --> 00:21:56.744]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:56.744 --> 00:21:58.185]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:58.185 --> 00:21:59.346]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:22:10.879 --> 00:22:14.302]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:14.302 --> 00:22:19.947]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:19.947 --> 00:22:25.131]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:22:25.131 --> 00:22:35.119]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:22:35.239 --> 00:22:37.580]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.181]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:39.181 --> 00:22:41.623]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.623 --> 00:22:43.744]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:43.744 --> 00:22:48.908]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:48.908 --> 00:22:58.013]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:00.106 --> 00:23:03.649]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:05.931]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:05.931 --> 00:23:06.812]  Don't!
[00:23:06.812 --> 00:23:10.254]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:23:10.254 --> 00:23:19.342]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[00:23:19.342 --> 00:23:23.005]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:23:23.405 --> 00:23:26.548]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:23:26.548 --> 00:23:33.916]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:23:33.916 --> 00:23:35.118]  Herb K was right.
[00:23:35.118 --> 00:23:38.301]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:23:38.301 --> 00:23:39.642]  What have you got to lose?
[00:23:39.642 --> 00:23:42.786]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[00:23:43.346 --> 00:23:46.669]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now!
[00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:47.289]  Call 888-352-7726.
[00:23:47.289 --> 00:23:47.790]  That's 888-352-7726.
[00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:47.870]  888-352-7726.
[00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:48.670]  Federal agents!
[00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:49.251]  We are armed!
[00:24:03.924 --> 00:24:08.850]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.032]  Would you stand up for true?
[00:24:11.032 --> 00:24:13.174]  What would you turn away to?
[00:24:13.174 --> 00:24:18.960]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.303]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[00:24:22.924 --> 00:24:24.586]  Every day it's in the news.
[00:24:24.586 --> 00:24:38.098]  I know you've all seen it countless times where CPS workers, police, truancy officers, school teachers, Boy Scout troop leaders get caught with very young children having sex with them.
[00:24:38.098 --> 00:24:42.982]  Totally evil, unnatural, sickening filth.
[00:24:42.982 --> 00:24:44.384]  Need to be locked up for life.
[00:24:46.434 --> 00:24:49.175]  Meanwhile, I've seen the statistics and I've got them right here in front of me.
[00:24:49.175 --> 00:24:57.998]  They let those violent sex offenders, true predators, go on average after five and a half years.
[00:24:57.998 --> 00:25:05.921]  Then meanwhile, I've seen multiple news reports of people caught urinating on the side of the highway.
[00:25:05.921 --> 00:25:09.142]  You're out driving through West Texas.
[00:25:09.142 --> 00:25:11.923]  They're in a gas station for a hundred miles.
[00:25:11.923 --> 00:25:15.524]  You pull off, you go over behind some bushes, the police pull over,
[00:25:16.553 --> 00:25:23.279]  And they take you to jail.
[00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:29.265]  Really, when I was up in Canada for Bilderberg, the police weren't going in the hotel, they were protecting me.
[00:25:29.265 --> 00:25:32.307]  They were going back over by a pond and bushes and peeing in the bushes.
[00:25:32.307 --> 00:25:37.472]  Should they all be arrested?
[00:25:37.472 --> 00:25:40.915]  But they now say that's a sex offender thing.
[00:25:40.915 --> 00:25:42.496]  Oh yeah, that's exposing yourself.
[00:25:43.323 --> 00:25:53.689]  Something everyone has done, pulling over in the middle of nowhere, going behind a bush.
[00:25:53.689 --> 00:25:56.071]  You are now a sex offender for the rest of your life.
[00:25:59.008 --> 00:26:15.020]  With underage sex offenders, anyone under the age of 18, having consensual sex, same age, it doesn't matter, until you're 26 in Texas, got the news article here today, I don't know what it is in other states, you are on a database.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.064]  You have to report yourself.
[00:26:19.064 --> 00:26:21.946]  And it's all selectively enforced.
[00:26:21.946 --> 00:26:23.207]  It's all selectively
[00:26:25.748 --> 00:26:26.748]  Carried out.
[00:26:26.748 --> 00:26:43.213]  And we see the news reports over and over again of someone will take a plastic Dixie knife, a butter knife that has a serrated edge to put butter on their bread at school, and they get arrested and charged.
[00:26:43.213 --> 00:26:51.296]  I saw several cases for some reason where it was valedictorians bringing cake to school for their teachers.
[00:26:51.296 --> 00:26:53.577]  Two separate cases the same.
[00:26:53.577 --> 00:26:54.157]  You can pull them up.
[00:26:55.581 --> 00:27:11.904]  And they bring a box of spoons, forks, and knives to cut it up and they get arrested and then have to do another year of school because they then, under zero tolerance, strip them of their year.
[00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:15.211]  Oh, but it gets worse.
[00:27:15.211 --> 00:27:24.917]  You've all seen the reports of young girls, young boys sent to school with aspirin or Advil or Luden's cough drops.
[00:27:24.917 --> 00:27:28.539]  Not even a drug, not even over-the-counter.
[00:27:28.539 --> 00:27:31.521]  Luden's isn't even an over-the-counter.
[00:27:31.521 --> 00:27:34.663]  There's nothing in it but a tiny bit of menthol to make it cool your throat.
[00:27:34.663 --> 00:27:36.324]  Not illegal.
[00:27:36.324 --> 00:27:39.266]  They arrest you.
[00:27:39.266 --> 00:27:41.247]  See, you're living in a total prison.
[00:27:42.859 --> 00:27:45.541]  A prison, that's like a supermax if you're caught with an aspirin.
[00:27:45.541 --> 00:27:49.024]  You get 30 days in the hole.
[00:27:49.024 --> 00:27:53.207]  First they banned dodgeball in most schools 15 years ago or so.
[00:27:53.207 --> 00:28:01.973]  Now there's no tag, no yelling, no wrestling, no jogging.
[00:28:01.973 --> 00:28:05.355]  They're pulling out the jungle gyms because somebody might get hurt.
[00:28:05.355 --> 00:28:08.558]  This is a total prison grid.
[00:28:08.558 --> 00:28:09.879]  They know what they're doing.
[00:28:11.152 --> 00:28:23.042]  Then the rest of the story, and I'm not gonna play it again today, anybody that wants to can just go to YouTube and type in, Rumsfeld grilled over DynCorp child trafficking.
[00:28:23.042 --> 00:28:27.306]  Or UN caught running child sex trade.
[00:28:27.306 --> 00:28:33.331]  And we're talking about in the millions in the last decade.
[00:28:33.331 --> 00:28:38.656]  European report, over one million children trafficked in Europe, mainly by the UN, DynCorp and others.
[00:28:39.875 --> 00:28:42.397]  Because they've got the diplomatic passports, diplomatic immunity.
[00:28:42.397 --> 00:28:44.019]  No one can search the aircraft.
[00:28:44.019 --> 00:28:49.083]  And they fly them into Saudi Arabia, Israel, Thailand, kids from all over the world.
[00:28:49.083 --> 00:28:57.110]  And Rumsfeld's asked about it by Congress, and he says, well, yeah, they're still getting contracts because, you know, we put them in the penalty box.
[00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:00.173]  You know, they got a fine.
[00:29:00.173 --> 00:29:04.617]  And how many times do you see in the news CPS workers, normally the head ones,
[00:29:05.438 --> 00:29:13.544]  And the Texas Youth Commission running rape rooms, and they shut down another private prison outside Austin because they were raping every woman in the facility.
[00:29:13.544 --> 00:29:16.647]  That was with adults.
[00:29:16.647 --> 00:29:24.853]  And they're passing laws where you can't have your own garden or burglar bars on your house, or where you can't be armed, because criminals run the government.
[00:29:24.853 --> 00:29:28.616]  What would criminals do if they ran the government?
[00:29:28.616 --> 00:29:29.257]  What they're doing now.
[00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:38.241]  And there's different little teams of criminals in government everywhere who kick the good people out and then promote all their scum in.
[00:29:38.241 --> 00:29:43.622]  And now it's all over the news that small towns everywhere just rob people's wallets out of their cars at checkpoints.
[00:29:43.622 --> 00:29:45.122]  No one gets in trouble.
[00:29:45.122 --> 00:29:47.443]  And it's getting worse by the millisecond.
[00:29:47.443 --> 00:29:51.223]  The tyrants are taking over every position.
[00:29:51.223 --> 00:29:52.624]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:55.144]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.144 --> 00:29:57.825]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:02.111 --> 00:31:06.139]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.139 --> 00:31:09.386]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.386 --> 00:31:10.809]  Is it finishing off this agenda?
[00:31:11.511 --> 00:31:14.173]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.173 --> 00:31:20.559]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:25.763]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:25.763 --> 00:31:35.751]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.871 --> 00:31:38.212]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.212 --> 00:31:39.793]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.793 --> 00:31:42.255]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.255 --> 00:31:44.376]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.376 --> 00:31:49.520]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:32:13.048 --> 00:32:14.149]  Now for the truth.
[00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:21.456]  Many people don't drink tea, but they drink energy drinks, colas, juices from concentrates, which all carry high levels of sugar and caffeine.
[00:32:21.836 --> 00:32:23.417]  Sugar is a toxin.
[00:32:23.417 --> 00:32:25.918]  Sugar does not help you, nor does caffeine.
[00:32:25.918 --> 00:32:29.499]  Your colon could be clogged, causing dangerous consequences.

[00:33:13.301 --> 00:33:14.243]  Central.
[00:33:14.243 --> 00:33:15.807]  We're here live.
[00:33:15.807 --> 00:33:16.589]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.589 --> 00:33:17.330]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:20.595 --> 00:33:23.157]  Larry Pratt coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:33:23.157 --> 00:33:26.400]  Breakdown of the latest attacks on the Second Amendment.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:32.085]  Burmese will pop in in the last 15 minutes of the next hour to cover what's really in the cyber security bill.
[00:33:32.085 --> 00:33:37.930]  Ron Paul and wide open phones in the last hour and a half of the broadcast today.
[00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.633]  I'll probably open the phones up and Larry Pratt's on with us as well.
[00:33:45.322 --> 00:33:46.663]  I mean, look at this article.
[00:33:46.663 --> 00:33:47.704]  This is out of England.
[00:33:47.704 --> 00:33:50.625]  Pupils age 5 on hate register.
[00:33:50.625 --> 00:33:54.328]  Teachers must log playground taunts for government database.
[00:33:54.328 --> 00:33:56.289]  Everyone's being made a spy for the government.
[00:33:56.289 --> 00:33:59.151]  Same thing happening here in the US.
[00:33:59.151 --> 00:34:00.312]  I mean, think about it.
[00:34:00.312 --> 00:34:06.956]  Prisoners in medium security prisons are allowed to play basketball and dodgeball and things like that, but not kids.
[00:34:06.956 --> 00:34:07.876]  Oh no, that's aggressive.
[00:34:07.876 --> 00:34:08.517]  That's bad.
[00:34:08.517 --> 00:34:09.517]  That's evil.
[00:34:09.517 --> 00:34:11.719]  Training you to be totally domesticated creatures.
[00:34:12.987 --> 00:34:23.071]  If you draw a picture of a gun in art class, you're arrested.
[00:34:23.071 --> 00:34:27.734]  In art class, every time we were given a chance to draw whatever we wanted, that's all the boys drew was soldiers with guns.
[00:34:27.734 --> 00:34:29.654]  Oh, you're all arrested.
[00:34:29.654 --> 00:34:37.378]  Heads will be forced... Heads of schools will be forced to list children as young as five on school hate registers.
[00:34:38.846 --> 00:34:41.568]  Over everyday playground insults.
[00:34:41.568 --> 00:34:49.032]  Even minor incidents must be recorded as examples of serious bullying and details kept on the database till the pupil leaves secondary school.
[00:34:49.032 --> 00:34:50.653]  You know it'll always be saved.
[00:34:50.653 --> 00:35:02.541]  Teachers are to be told that even if a primary school child uses homophobic or racist words without knowing their meaning, simply teaching them such words are hurtful and inappropriate is not enough.
[00:35:03.638 --> 00:35:11.124]  Instead, the incident has been recorded and his or her behavior monitored for future signs of hate bullying.
[00:35:11.124 --> 00:35:15.588]  See, when you put your kids in school, it's for them to be tracked, traced, and be given a record of some type.
[00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:19.317]  I mean, take Austin, Texas.
[00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:21.159]  I've got the local newscast.
[00:35:21.159 --> 00:35:27.867]  They have built little portable buildings on all the major middle schools and high schools where they have court every week.
[00:35:27.867 --> 00:35:28.808]  But it's not even real court.
[00:35:28.808 --> 00:35:32.132]  They call the kids in and say, you've been late to class three times last month.
[00:35:32.132 --> 00:35:33.454]  I'm charging you with truancy.
[00:35:33.454 --> 00:35:34.775]  I will have you arrested right now.
[00:35:36.092 --> 00:35:38.073]  Unless you sign this agreement.
[00:35:38.073 --> 00:35:38.974]  It's not a real court.
[00:35:38.974 --> 00:35:40.895]  They're not told about due process, nothing.
[00:35:40.895 --> 00:35:44.337]  And the parents on the news shake and sign it, and they go on probation.
[00:35:44.337 --> 00:35:45.618]  Afforded judification.
[00:35:45.618 --> 00:35:54.383]  They agree to it, and now when they screw up in any way, even though the truancy law says that's not truancy, they've got them.
[00:35:54.383 --> 00:36:01.066]  If they do something in the next six months on the afforded judification, including being late to class, now they go to jail.
[00:36:01.066 --> 00:36:04.328]  All fraud, all criminal, totally evil.
[00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:05.269]  Going on nationwide.
[00:36:07.403 --> 00:36:19.206]  The accusations will also be recorded in a database held by councils and city governments and made available to Whitehall, federal government, and ministers to help them devise future anti-bullying campaigns or brainwashing.
[00:36:19.206 --> 00:36:35.189]  The scale of the effort to stop children using homophobic or racist language was revealed after the parents of a 10-year-old primary school pupil in Somerset, Peter Drury, were told that his name would be put on a register and his behavior monitored while he remained at school.
[00:36:38.632 --> 00:36:43.796]  The boy was reported after he called a friend a gay boy.
[00:36:43.796 --> 00:36:45.558]  Kids always say that, I don't even know what it means.
[00:36:45.558 --> 00:36:47.560]  Oh, that's gay, this is gay.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:53.945]  His parents fear the record of homophobic bullying will count against him throughout his school career and even into adulthood.
[00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:56.447]  Well, of course, that's the mind control.
[00:36:56.447 --> 00:37:05.935]  In another incident last year, a six-year-old girl, Sharon Gower, was reported for racist bullying at her school near Turnbridge, Wells and Kent.
[00:37:06.795 --> 00:37:14.958]  Sharon, who was chased by two 11-year-old girls, one of whom taunted her that she had chocolate on her face.
[00:37:14.958 --> 00:37:20.340]  The six-year-old responded to one of the girls, who was black, well, you've got chocolate on yours.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.742]  It's all selectively enforced, of course, everybody against each other.
[00:37:23.742 --> 00:37:25.302]  It's all mind control.
[00:37:25.302 --> 00:37:33.825]  Many schools nationwide have already followed advice that they should record incidents of alleged racist, homophobic, or anti-disability bullying.
[00:37:33.825 --> 00:37:34.846]  One report last year by
[00:37:36.661 --> 00:37:47.784]  Man Festro Club, Civil Liberties Think Tank, said 40,000 children each year are having racist charges added to their school records.
[00:37:47.784 --> 00:37:53.425]  It's called hate taunting.
[00:37:53.425 --> 00:37:59.206]  And it goes on, on and on.
[00:37:59.206 --> 00:38:02.447]  If you call someone fat, it's over for you.
[00:38:04.178 --> 00:38:06.260]  This is the mind control.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:15.047]  And remember, meanwhile, all over the United States and Europe, they have the police come into public schools, elementary, middle school, and high school, unannounced.
[00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:24.695]  In militia uniforms, with guns, firing blanks, screaming, we are homeschoolers against public education, we are going to kill you.
[00:38:24.695 --> 00:38:26.196]  That was in the Associated Press.
[00:38:26.196 --> 00:38:33.381]  The children urinate on themselves, collapse, teachers collapse, some had to be put in psychiatric facilities, that happened in Minnesota.
[00:38:33.381 --> 00:38:37.804]  Totally screwed the one teacher up, she thought they were really going to kill her.
[00:38:37.804 --> 00:38:40.446]  They have in high school these weekend
[00:38:41.468 --> 00:38:44.550]  Camp events where they then have the police come in and threaten to kill them.
[00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.632]  It's all re-education camps.
[00:38:46.632 --> 00:38:49.574]  You are living in a giant re-education camp.
[00:38:49.574 --> 00:38:51.416]  When you watch television, it's brainwashing you.
[00:38:51.416 --> 00:38:54.618]  When you're in school, all the diversity training.
[00:38:54.618 --> 00:39:08.529]  It's all about raising the awareness about racial and sexual differences to get everyone at each other's throats, completely divided, so the government can play the part of the arbiter, the referee.
[00:39:12.765 --> 00:39:15.328]  Okay, I'm done on that subject because we've got a lot of news to cover.
[00:39:15.328 --> 00:39:20.555]  I just want people to be aware of what we're facing as a society.
[00:39:20.555 --> 00:39:26.583]  Before I get into all of the news of the government levying and pushing for scores of new taxes at every level,
[00:39:29.278 --> 00:39:31.940]  This is a Ron Paul press release.
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:47.151]  Congressman Ron Paul has continued to run his Congressional office in a frugal manner and was able to return more than $100,000 from his allotted office budget to the Treasury this year, an increase of over $90,000 returned last year.
[00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:58.460]  Since my first year in Congress representing the 14th District, I have managed my office in a frugal manner, instructing staff to provide the greatest possible service to the people of the 14th District at the least possible cost to taxpayers, said Paul.
[00:40:01.431 --> 00:40:08.376]  Meanwhile, what, two years ago, Pelosi got an extra billion plus dollars just for her Air Force One fleet.
[00:40:08.376 --> 00:40:13.780]  She has an Air Force, she has two Air Force One type planes.
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:18.584]  A billion bucks for Pelosi and some of her other top staff.
[00:40:18.584 --> 00:40:26.069]  I forget how many, I think it was 20 something planes they bought, but two big jumbos.
[00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.870]  Oh, you gotta love it.
[00:40:28.888 --> 00:40:36.790]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, $7 a gallon gas needed to meet CO2 cuts.
[00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:39.430]  This is from Heritage.org.
[00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:42.571]  The national average of gasoline creeps to $3 a gallon.
[00:40:42.571 --> 00:40:46.932]  Economists are warning that high gas prices in the United States could slow economic recovery.
[00:40:46.932 --> 00:40:54.354]  Other countries' economies are recovering more quickly and increased production and activity is putting upward pressure on oil prices.
[00:40:55.128 --> 00:41:07.398]  And they go on to break down $7 a gallon gas to reduce carbon dioxide emissions being called for by the Environmental Protection Agency, and they have links to that.
[00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:09.920]  Here's another headline, How High Could the U.S.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.602]  Tax Rate Go?
[00:41:11.602 --> 00:41:19.208]  Time Magazine saying that we've got to have increased income taxes to pay off the debt, which is all made up to the bankers.
[00:41:23.769 --> 00:41:29.353]  Never mind mortgaging the future by running up a monster deficit as it struggles to keep the economy going.
[00:41:29.353 --> 00:41:34.056]  The Obama administration is setting the stage for sharply higher taxes down the road.
[00:41:34.056 --> 00:41:36.937]  And it goes through it.
[00:41:36.937 --> 00:41:37.658]  Here's another one.
[00:41:37.658 --> 00:41:42.121]  Senate trio hopes to hit pay dirt with carbon fee on fuels.
[00:41:45.424 --> 00:41:51.227]  They're introducing new legislation with the backing of ConocoPhillips, BP, ExxonMobil Corp.
[00:41:51.227 --> 00:41:51.748]  Oh, really?
[00:41:51.748 --> 00:42:00.233]  They want the carbon taxes with direct taxes on fuel at the refinery passed on to you.
[00:42:00.233 --> 00:42:01.733]  That's the New York Times.
[00:42:01.733 --> 00:42:05.976]  Key senators are weighing a request from big oil to levy a carbon fee.
[00:42:05.976 --> 00:42:07.577]  They want it.
[00:42:07.577 --> 00:42:10.639]  They want it because they're owned by the big banks.
[00:42:10.639 --> 00:42:11.259]  We'll get the money.
[00:42:12.842 --> 00:42:17.085]  Every time I criticize fake global warming, I get emails going, you work for oil companies.
[00:42:17.085 --> 00:42:21.007]  Have you opened a magazine in the last five years?
[00:42:21.007 --> 00:42:28.111]  Almost every time I see a carbon tax ad telling us how the Earth's dying, it's from an oil company.
[00:42:28.111 --> 00:42:32.874]  If accepted, the approach supported by ConocoPhillips, BP, American, and ExxonMobil Corp.
[00:42:32.874 --> 00:42:37.937]  could rearrange the politics of the Senate climate debate and potentially open up votes that may not have been there otherwise.
[00:42:41.491 --> 00:42:49.613]  It gets you a solution to the carbon problem that doesn't destroy that part of the economy, said Lindsey Graham, Republican, South Carolina.
[00:42:49.613 --> 00:43:02.496]  Yeah, you gotta love him and Newt Gingrich and Senator McCain and Governor Palin and now Glenn Beck, all saying global warming's real.
[00:43:02.496 --> 00:43:07.297]  And we've got Newt Gingrich and all of them.
[00:43:07.297 --> 00:43:08.157]  These people are sick.
[00:43:09.346 --> 00:43:14.729]  But don't worry, you elect Republicans, they're going to save you from it.
[00:43:14.729 --> 00:43:22.894]  The lead co-author of the Senate legislation, Lindsey Graham, said yesterday, it gets you a solution to the carbon problem that doesn't destroy part of the economy.
[00:43:22.894 --> 00:43:24.775]  Oh sure, a giant tax doesn't.
[00:43:24.775 --> 00:43:32.640]  Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat Louisiana, said yesterday she has been in talks for several months with Graham and Senator John Kerry and Joe Lieberman.
[00:43:33.641 --> 00:43:43.343]  On a proposal that sets up a linked carbon-free on transportation fuels with revenues raised going back to consumers to help them deal with higher gas prices.
[00:43:43.343 --> 00:43:45.544]  Oh yes!
[00:43:45.544 --> 00:43:49.265]  A tax will help you deal with higher gas prices.
[00:43:49.265 --> 00:43:50.925]  That's right, that's a quote.
[00:43:50.925 --> 00:43:52.746]  More taxes will help you.
[00:43:52.746 --> 00:43:55.226]  More expensive gas will help you pay for it.
[00:43:55.226 --> 00:43:57.367]  Yes!
[00:43:57.367 --> 00:43:59.287]  That's like saying, oh you're having trouble paying for milk?
[00:43:59.287 --> 00:44:00.408]  We'll just double the price of it.
[00:44:00.408 --> 00:44:00.948]  That'll help you.
[00:44:01.863 --> 00:44:03.184]  Oh, you've got your finger chopped off.
[00:44:03.184 --> 00:44:05.945]  Here, let me chop your arms and legs off with a hatchet.
[00:44:05.945 --> 00:44:07.386]  Let me shoot you in the head five times.
[00:44:07.386 --> 00:44:09.047]  That will help you not bleed to death.
[00:44:09.047 --> 00:44:10.547]  Oh, you have a hangnail.
[00:44:10.547 --> 00:44:12.348]  Let me hatchet you in the head five times.
[00:44:12.348 --> 00:44:14.449]  That will fix it.
[00:44:14.449 --> 00:44:22.433]  I mean, it's just, they practice over-the-top absurdist lies just to condition you to just accept it.
[00:44:22.433 --> 00:44:23.834]  This is all done scientifically.
[00:44:23.834 --> 00:44:27.076]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:44:27.076 --> 00:44:29.237]  Oh my gosh, my head is spinning right now.
[00:44:33.624 --> 00:44:38.747]  I got another article here that they're set to pass a law in New Mexico putting a huge tax on all food.
[00:44:38.747 --> 00:44:42.328]  A bunch of other states, counties, and cities are doing the same thing.
[00:44:42.328 --> 00:44:44.870]  Oh yes, the government's going to help you.
[00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:48.792]  Hitting the most poor with taxes on food.
[00:44:48.792 --> 00:44:50.112]  Shifting gears out of the taxes.
[00:44:50.112 --> 00:44:51.033]  That's just part of the articles.
[00:44:51.033 --> 00:44:51.993]  I'll get into more.
[00:44:51.993 --> 00:45:00.538]  Here's another important article from PrisonPlanet.com from Steve Watson today.
[00:45:01.892 --> 00:45:14.361]  Remember two months ago, Caller started calling saying we need to take the Tea Parties over that we started as true constitutionalists and patriots from the mainline Republicans that are demonizing birthers and anybody else that doesn't trust Obama now?
[00:45:14.361 --> 00:45:20.126]  The Republican leadership will teach us to not criticize the Federal Reserve.
[00:45:20.126 --> 00:45:23.408]  We don't want any anti-war people in the Tea Parties.
[00:45:23.408 --> 00:45:26.691]  We're going to teach the opposition how to behave.
[00:45:29.107 --> 00:45:34.310]  And then the media's gonna attack Oath Keepers and myself and Sheriff Mac and oh, we're so dangerous.
[00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:37.571]  New York Times, Time Magazine, Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:45:37.571 --> 00:45:41.734]  I mean, just every day big publications attack yours truly.
[00:45:41.734 --> 00:45:43.395]  Don't let this guy run the Tea Parties.
[00:45:43.395 --> 00:45:47.757]  I don't even go to Tea Parties!
[00:45:47.757 --> 00:45:57.362]  Sure, my listeners are at all of them, but Time Magazine, or was it Newsweek, I forget, two weeks ago, called me the prophet of the Tea Parties.
[00:46:00.103 --> 00:46:06.408]  Like Moses or something wandering around on Radio Wasteland.
[00:46:06.408 --> 00:46:09.451]  But callers said we ought to be the coffee party to wake up the tea party.
[00:46:09.451 --> 00:46:11.713]  Well, I registered some names.
[00:46:11.713 --> 00:46:16.637]  I meant to create our code and what a real tea party would stand for.
[00:46:16.637 --> 00:46:20.320]  And it didn't happen.
[00:46:21.937 --> 00:46:32.985]  That we should be non-partisan, that we should follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution, that we should demand government be cut, and that new taxes not be levied as all the major Fox News hosts are pushing for.
[00:46:32.985 --> 00:46:35.067]  O'Reilly, Beck, it's conservative!
[00:46:35.067 --> 00:46:36.788]  We've got to pay off this debt.
[00:46:36.788 --> 00:46:39.630]  We need a value-added tax and a sales tax on top of the income tax.
[00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:40.471]  Oh, that's conservative!
[00:46:42.995 --> 00:46:44.615]  We need to have that in the code.
[00:46:44.615 --> 00:46:46.656]  Watson, just write a code of the Tea Parties.
[00:46:46.656 --> 00:46:48.497]  You've got my mind.
[00:46:48.497 --> 00:46:49.617]  Same, same view.
[00:46:49.617 --> 00:46:53.838]  Just, we need to write, like, the 20 position points of the real Tea Party.
[00:46:53.838 --> 00:46:55.199]  We gotta get that up.
[00:46:55.199 --> 00:46:56.939]  But, because I can't do it all.
[00:46:56.939 --> 00:47:00.720]  Watson's also finally getting up the, uh, because he's got, he went down the memory hole.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:01.900]  We get so busy.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:06.922]  The, uh, body scanner protest, uh, contest today, but, um,
[00:47:10.287 --> 00:47:16.270]  We waited too long, so Obama has launched a coffee party to try to take over the tea parties.
[00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:28.876]  And they're all over CNN and MSNBC and New York Times being given unlimited coverage to try to get all the fools that support Obama to come out and demand goodies from the government.
[00:47:28.876 --> 00:47:31.337]  And they're doing the same thing Glenn Beck did as a fake conservative.
[00:47:31.337 --> 00:47:35.919]  They're positioning themselves with a lot of reasonable-sounding nomenclature.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:40.503]  To get a big movement going and then bait and switch it even further.
[00:47:40.503 --> 00:47:44.526]  The article is, coffee party founder is Obama campaign operative.
[00:47:44.526 --> 00:47:45.947]  Top operative!
[00:47:45.947 --> 00:47:52.592]  He tried to launch his national compulsory service that White House science czar said would be compulsory for everyone.
[00:47:52.592 --> 00:47:54.553]  They tried to recruit out of the high schools.
[00:47:54.553 --> 00:47:58.796]  They tried to get 15 million other people to knock on doors.
[00:47:58.796 --> 00:47:59.817]  Only a million showed up.
[00:48:01.311 --> 00:48:05.012]  And 13 and a half months in his administration, and this whole system has fallen apart.
[00:48:05.012 --> 00:48:08.314]  He has the lowest approval rating of any president one year in in history.
[00:48:08.314 --> 00:48:11.715]  So now they're going to pose as grassroots with the coffee party.
[00:48:11.715 --> 00:48:19.718]  No, the coffee party was the idea of my listeners, and hence our initiative, and it does not belong to you.
[00:48:19.718 --> 00:48:23.860]  So now, I've been trying to spend more time at home with my family.
[00:48:24.804 --> 00:48:26.745]  I'm trying to finish two films.
[00:48:26.745 --> 00:48:27.246]  But that's it.
[00:48:27.246 --> 00:48:28.707]  I'm just not going home the next few days.
[00:48:28.707 --> 00:48:31.889]  I'm going to have to stay up here this weekend and get the coffee party launched.
[00:48:31.889 --> 00:48:33.851]  And no, I'm not going to organize the meetings and events.
[00:48:33.851 --> 00:48:38.434]  We'll put the code up there, the idea, and you can do spinoffs or whatever you want.
[00:48:38.434 --> 00:48:44.599]  For heaven's sakes, we need to get out on the streets now and not let Obama create a coffee party.
[00:48:44.599 --> 00:48:50.243]  Heavens, this just gets worse by the minute.
[00:48:50.243 --> 00:48:53.206]  Build is an alternative grassroots movement to the Tea Party, which has been
[00:48:54.428 --> 00:48:58.110]  For the most part, absorbed by the mainland Republicans and neoconservatives.
[00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:03.613]  See, we need something for true populists, not Republicans, not Democrats, but for people that want to fight the New World Order.
[00:49:03.613 --> 00:49:14.059]  The Coffee Party, oh yes, promised to wake up potentially politically-minded Americans and offered a different avenue for the Freedom Movement.
[00:49:14.059 --> 00:49:16.640]  Yes, it's billing itself as the Freedom Movement.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.082]  Rick Perry's the Freedom Movement and Obama's the Freedom Movement.
[00:49:20.082 --> 00:49:22.063]  Yo, they're going to fight the New World Order.
[00:49:24.793 --> 00:49:25.593]  How sick is this?
[00:49:25.593 --> 00:49:27.034]  And, of course, Democrats won't wake up.
[00:49:27.034 --> 00:49:31.377]  They'll go join it like idiots, just like Republicans have been allowed to take over the Tea Parties.
[00:49:31.377 --> 00:49:43.243]  However, the so-called founder of the Coffee Party has been quickly exposed as Obama campaign operatives, whose caffeine concept was purely designed to undermine and co-opt the Tea Party ideology.
[00:49:43.243 --> 00:49:48.286]  Matt, I need you today to get with Kurt and Watson and at least get the page up.
[00:49:48.286 --> 00:49:52.569]  I need Kurt to make just a basic splash page that looks good, red, white, and blue.
[00:49:53.697 --> 00:50:02.968]  We need to write an article of why we're launching the coffee party, that it was our idea to wake up the Tea Party, not to be an Obama thing.
[00:50:02.968 --> 00:50:14.561]  And you know they're listening to the show, and this is disgusting, that they took my listeners' ideas, what was it, two months ago, we got a bunch of calls, people spontaneously having the idea, and now this sniveling creature has hijacked it.
[00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:25.354]  Described as a documentary filmmaker who lives outside Washington, Annabelle Park has amassed 40,000 members via Facebook page.
[00:50:25.354 --> 00:50:27.295]  Okay, well we're starting our coffee party.
[00:50:27.295 --> 00:50:29.277]  Get me a Facebook now.
[00:50:29.277 --> 00:50:33.520]  And we need to get... We have more than 80,000 between all our Facebook pages.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.322]  We need to get a coffee party organization right now there.
[00:50:37.322 --> 00:50:40.344]  Look, we need to dwarf their numbers now and get out ahead of this right now.
[00:50:40.344 --> 00:50:42.766]  This is a horrible New World Order counterattack.
[00:50:44.397 --> 00:50:46.258]  We're not the opposite of the Tea Party, Ms.
[00:50:46.258 --> 00:50:47.799]  Part 41 told the New York Times.
[00:50:47.799 --> 00:50:50.380]  We're a different model of civic participation.
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.102]  But in the end, we may want some of the same things.
[00:50:53.102 --> 00:50:57.284]  So, now Obama can't beat us, so he's going to try to join us.
[00:50:57.284 --> 00:51:00.166]  Obama, fighting the New World Order, oh yeah!
[00:51:01.007 --> 00:51:02.788]  Great news for pure water lovers!
[00:51:02.788 --> 00:51:05.630]  The Big Berkey Water Filter is available once again.

[00:52:02.394 --> 00:52:06.398]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.398 --> 00:52:09.661]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.661 --> 00:52:11.063]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.767 --> 00:52:14.429]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.429 --> 00:52:20.835]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.835 --> 00:52:26.019]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:26.019 --> 00:52:36.007]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:36.127 --> 00:52:38.469]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.469 --> 00:52:40.050]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:42.511]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.511 --> 00:52:44.653]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.653 --> 00:52:49.796]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.796 --> 00:52:54.800]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.902]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:01.238 --> 00:53:03.219]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:53:03.219 --> 00:53:08.561]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:53:08.561 --> 00:53:10.182]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:53:10.182 --> 00:53:18.585]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:53:18.585 --> 00:53:24.308]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:53:24.708 --> 00:53:26.309]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:28.510]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:33.032]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:53:33.032 --> 00:53:35.253]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:53:35.253 --> 00:53:43.016]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:53:43.336 --> 00:53:43.596]  We're good.
[00:54:24.941 --> 00:54:29.544]  So the Republicans took over the Tea Party movement last year, or at least have tried to.
[00:54:29.544 --> 00:54:41.552]  They've got Republican operatives all over television, all over print, demonizing any true constitutionalist in the Tea Party, like myself, Oath Keepers, and others.
[00:54:41.552 --> 00:54:44.074]  Sheriff Mack, Tom Tancredo,
[00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:57.325]  And, uh, I've told you we've seen the same talking points from Glenn Beck and Chris Matthews talking about how the Tea Party's violent and bad and evil and, you know, there's dangerous elements in it.
[00:54:57.325 --> 00:55:01.328]  That of the minority, when really all the polls show we're the majority.
[00:55:01.328 --> 00:55:03.430]  Just on the case of birthers.
[00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:06.633]  Over 50% of the Tea Party people questioned are big birthers.
[00:55:06.633 --> 00:55:07.974]  Over half of Republicans are.
[00:55:09.107 --> 00:55:11.389]  But Beck says they're 5%.
[00:55:11.389 --> 00:55:12.290]  So they're teamed up.
[00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:16.814]  The Republicans and Democrats are teamed up to try to go into this big grassroots movement.
[00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:20.357]  First they label it as the only grassroots movement, which isn't true.
[00:55:20.357 --> 00:55:26.061]  Then they go in and take it over from the left and right paradigm, playing against the middle, like WWF wrestling.
[00:55:26.061 --> 00:55:28.223]  And Vince McMahon's wife's now running for the U.S.
[00:55:28.223 --> 00:55:28.964]  Senate.
[00:55:28.964 --> 00:55:29.324]  Why not?
[00:55:29.324 --> 00:55:32.667]  We'll have nothing but wrestlers of their families in the government.
[00:55:35.595 --> 00:55:40.236]  Coffee Party founder is Obama campaign operative.
[00:55:40.236 --> 00:55:43.176]  She says, we're not the opposite of the Tea Party, Ms.
[00:55:43.176 --> 00:55:46.217]  Park, Obama operative, 41 told the New York Times.
[00:55:46.217 --> 00:55:48.417]  We're a different model of civic participation.
[00:55:48.417 --> 00:55:51.298]  So this is Obama's National Service Corps.
[00:55:51.298 --> 00:55:54.718]  But in the end, we may want some things and some of the same things.
[00:55:54.718 --> 00:56:00.259]  We need to roll up our sleeves, put our heads together, and work it out, she said.
[00:56:00.259 --> 00:56:03.440]  That, to me, is an American way of doing things.
[00:56:06.963 --> 00:56:10.885]  The slogan is, wake up and stand up.
[00:56:10.885 --> 00:56:13.646]  Oh, wake up, Obama's gonna save us.
[00:56:13.646 --> 00:56:18.427]  The mission statement declares that the federal government is not the enemy of the people.
[00:56:18.427 --> 00:56:19.488]  Oh!
[00:56:19.488 --> 00:56:21.609]  But the expression of our collective will.
[00:56:22.705 --> 00:56:24.867]  So it's saying this is your government.
[00:56:24.867 --> 00:56:28.291]  It doesn't matter they do the opposite of what people want in every poll.
[00:56:28.291 --> 00:56:37.281]  And that we must participate in the democratic process in order to address the challenges we face as Americans with the electronic voting machines.
[00:56:37.281 --> 00:56:44.589]  At first glance this sounds like attractive stuff to concerned Americans who are sick and tired of big government ruling over their lives.
[00:56:46.434 --> 00:56:48.255]  However, a quick background search on Ms.
[00:56:48.255 --> 00:56:50.316]  Park reveals her real intentions.
[00:56:50.316 --> 00:56:53.759]  And again, the states are the way to get control of the federal government.
[00:56:53.759 --> 00:56:56.961]  But that's what the Republicans are trying to block running the Tea Parties.
[00:56:56.961 --> 00:56:57.661]  Same thing here.
[00:56:57.661 --> 00:57:00.763]  Oh no, the federal government is you!
[00:57:00.763 --> 00:57:01.563]  It listens to you.
[00:57:01.563 --> 00:57:04.485]  You need to work through it.
[00:57:04.485 --> 00:57:11.970]  Park campaigned for Obama in 2008 and was one of his organizers and operators of the influential United for Obama video channel on YouTube.
[00:57:14.269 --> 00:57:21.312]  Quote, quoting her, I found that people have little understanding of the change that Senator Barack Obama is advocating.
[00:57:21.312 --> 00:57:32.297]  I thought from my experience in using videos for civil movements, that videos would be the best way to promote the need for change and for Obama.
[00:57:32.297 --> 00:57:37.639]  That's why I decided to work for the Obama campaign, Annabelle Park said.
[00:57:37.639 --> 00:57:42.061]  She made over 20 personal videos for Obama campaign that drew tens of thousands of views.
[00:57:44.087 --> 00:57:55.854]  The revelation, along with the discovery that Park is a former strategy analyst at the New York Times, who's now interviewing her, explains why she received a great deal of mainstream media coverage recently.
[00:57:55.854 --> 00:57:56.735]  Oh yes!
[00:57:56.735 --> 00:58:01.078]  The Times, the Washington Post, both ran glowing articles on Park.
[00:58:01.078 --> 00:58:02.378]  What does that tell you?
[00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:06.781]  In the last week, a factor that immediately raised suspicion over her grassroots credentials.
[00:58:06.781 --> 00:58:09.223]  Clearly, either the newspapers were incapable of
[00:58:10.083 --> 00:58:18.729]  Googling her name or taking five minutes out to look at her activities, or they were fully aware of Park's intentions and background and chose not to include those in the piece.
[00:58:18.729 --> 00:58:21.191]  Well, of course Obama's running the whole thing.
[00:58:21.191 --> 00:58:29.637]  In addition, Park's various tweets reveal, far from being open to working with the Tea Party activists, Park appears to have vitriolic hatred of them.
[00:58:30.595 --> 00:58:33.838]  And then she goes on to talk about how they're dangerous scum.
[00:58:33.838 --> 00:58:36.681]  But now she wants to be your friend, Tea Party.
[00:58:36.681 --> 00:58:38.602]  Just like Glenn Beck.
[00:58:38.602 --> 00:58:41.125]  Working together.
[00:58:41.125 --> 00:58:46.750]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:49.953]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:50.896 --> 00:58:57.539]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:58:57.539 --> 00:59:02.681]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:59:02.681 --> 00:59:11.404]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:59:11.404 --> 00:59:15.486]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:59:15.486 --> 00:59:17.447]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:59:19.778 --> 00:59:24.500]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:28.342]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:59:28.342 --> 00:59:29.562]  Others don't.
[00:59:29.562 --> 00:59:31.723]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:31.723 --> 00:59:33.504]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:59:33.504 --> 00:59:36.385]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:59:36.385 --> 00:59:43.008]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:59:43.008 --> 00:59:45.709]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:59:45.709 --> 00:59:48.070]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:48.951]  Others don't.
[00:59:53.544 --> 00:59:55.925]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.925 --> 01:00:05.349]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:06.650]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:08.431]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.431 --> 01:00:10.191]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.191 --> 01:00:11.752]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.752 --> 01:00:13.333]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.333 --> 01:00:17.515]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.515 --> 01:00:19.856]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.749 --> 01:00:22.611]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:35.340]  Two months ago, callers to my radio show and emailers said, Alex, start a national coffee party to wake up the tea parties that neocons are taking it over.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.781]  And we bought the website names.
[01:00:37.978 --> 01:00:44.583]  I didn't build it, I meant to just put up a code of what a real Tea Party person, from my view, should support.
[01:00:44.583 --> 01:00:48.546]  Cutting taxes, smaller government, controlling our borders, not launching all these new wars.
[01:00:48.546 --> 01:00:52.369]  You know, that the Oath Keepers are good, Sheriff Mack is good.
[01:00:52.369 --> 01:00:56.572]  Because now the Republican Party's coming out demonizing Sheriff Mack.
[01:00:56.572 --> 01:01:02.117]  And saying, oh, these are extremists, saying sheriffs need to, you know, run their county and that the states need to get control.
[01:01:03.342 --> 01:01:07.444]  Well now the Democrats have been caught setting up a coffee party.
[01:01:07.444 --> 01:01:09.465]  No doubt trying to preempt us.
[01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:15.149]  So we're going to crack the whip around here and get this up and get this rolling in the next few days.
[01:01:15.149 --> 01:01:17.770]  I'm going to cover more of that coming up.
[01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:19.051]  We got Ron Paul in one hour.
[01:01:20.203 --> 01:01:32.995]  We'll talk about a host of important issues with the Congressman, but for the next 30 minutes, we're joined by Larry Pratt, Executive Director of the only real national, no-compromise, Second Amendment lobby, Gun Owners of America.
[01:01:32.995 --> 01:01:41.984]  And I've got him on about a host of issues, but every few months he comes on to break down the latest attack strategies by the victim disarmament parasites in government.
[01:01:43.215 --> 01:01:45.156]  And, uh, the D.C.
[01:01:45.156 --> 01:01:48.677]  Heller case said, yeah, you got an individual right, but we have a right to restrict it.
[01:01:48.677 --> 01:01:50.517]  So, it was really, in a way, bad.
[01:01:50.517 --> 01:02:00.921]  Uh, this, in, in, in new statements, they haven't ruled yet, but they made statements during the deliberations, that, oh, yeah, Chicago and New York and D.C.
[01:02:00.921 --> 01:02:04.182]  can't completely not let you have guns, but we do, uh,
[01:02:06.502 --> 01:02:08.483]  Basically, you have a right to turn your guns in.
[01:02:08.483 --> 01:02:13.526]  Yes, you have a Second Amendment, but we have a right to ban your guns if we want, which is totally asinine.
[01:02:13.526 --> 01:02:16.227]  So, joining us is Larry Pratt.
[01:02:16.227 --> 01:02:20.630]  Larry, I've seen some of the gun-grabbing groups are saying they're actually happy about where the court's going.
[01:02:21.783 --> 01:02:23.144]  A couple reasons, I think.
[01:02:23.144 --> 01:02:51.576]  One is that they are hoping that the standard that the court will use in determining that the Chicago handgun ban is unconstitutional, and most people think they will do that, but the standard that they are very possibly going to use would mean that you could start heading off into the wild blue yonder and making housing a right, or health a right, and of course that would be the end of freedom in this country as we know it.
[01:02:52.216 --> 01:02:56.838]  And this is something that has been developing over time.
[01:02:56.838 --> 01:02:59.539]  This wouldn't be new with this case.
[01:02:59.539 --> 01:03:04.120]  The judges have been taking power into their hands for a long time.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:18.965]  That's not a news flash, certainly not to you and your listeners, but the fact is they may continue in that direction, and that is going to mean more gun control would be possible.
[01:03:18.965 --> 01:03:21.646]  They'll decide on a case-by-case basis,
[01:03:22.483 --> 01:03:24.965]  Scalia's opinion in the D.C.
[01:03:24.965 --> 01:03:30.629]  handgun case made it sound like he didn't have any problem if government wanted to outlaw machine guns.
[01:03:30.629 --> 01:03:41.356]  Well, excuse me, but if there is a militia weapon of our day, the quintessential militia weapon, that's it!
[01:03:41.356 --> 01:03:46.779]  That's the one that the Swiss send home with every one of their citizen army.
[01:03:46.779 --> 01:03:49.121]  And here in this country, we think somehow
[01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:53.334]  Only the government should have the militia weapon?
[01:03:53.334 --> 01:03:54.154]  Woof!
[01:03:54.154 --> 01:04:03.019]  That's the kind of militia they have in Cuba, in Venezuela, had in the Soviet Union, and so forth.
[01:04:03.019 --> 01:04:06.300]  It's going to be nice that you'll be able to have a handgun in Chicago.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.161]  That's a likely outcome.
[01:04:08.161 --> 01:04:10.562]  Probably at least five votes in favor of that.
[01:04:10.562 --> 01:04:14.004]  Maybe even six.
[01:04:14.004 --> 01:04:18.707]  Then we're going to have to continue watching what Mr. Heller, who got the D.C.
[01:04:18.707 --> 01:04:19.627]  gun ban overturned,
[01:04:20.265 --> 01:04:20.786]  Absolutely!
[01:04:38.024 --> 01:04:43.269]  Unless you make a $30,000 donation to the sheriff in New York, you're not going to get one.
[01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:45.490]  So only rich Goldman Sachs billionaires have it.
[01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:46.551]  That was in Bloomberg.
[01:04:46.551 --> 01:04:47.873]  They're arming against the public.
[01:04:47.873 --> 01:04:51.135]  The bankers have all got semi-autos, whatever they want.
[01:04:51.135 --> 01:04:58.141]  The public's being mugged in the street by the hordes of vampiric homeless people running around in a drug-crazed stupor.
[01:04:58.141 --> 01:04:58.522]  Stay there.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:05.924]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:05.924 --> 01:05:09.166]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:13.970]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:20.356]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:20.356 --> 01:05:22.598]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:23.118 --> 01:05:23.438]  Tim Geithner?
[01:05:23.438 --> 01:05:23.939]  Bernanke?
[01:05:23.939 --> 01:05:24.619]  They're arsonists!
[01:05:24.619 --> 01:05:25.920]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:28.142]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:42.034 --> 01:05:49.318]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:05:49.318 --> 01:05:58.423]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:02.366 --> 01:06:06.349]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:15.216]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:15.216 --> 01:06:19.840]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:30.669]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:40.792]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:40.792 --> 01:06:46.214]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:46.214 --> 01:06:53.717]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:53.717 --> 01:06:56.458]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:04.792]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.792 --> 01:07:05.712]  Number one.
[01:07:05.712 --> 01:07:09.134]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.134 --> 01:07:09.994]  Number two.
[01:07:09.994 --> 01:07:14.896]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.896 --> 01:07:15.636]  It's true.
[01:07:15.636 --> 01:07:20.178]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.498 --> 01:07:21.318]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.318 --> 01:07:24.899]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.899 --> 01:07:28.820]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:29.620]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.381]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:36.062]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:36.062 --> 01:07:36.842]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.842 --> 01:07:40.983]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.983 --> 01:07:45.744]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:46.044 --> 01:07:50.207]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.207 --> 01:07:52.009]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:52.009 --> 01:07:54.251]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:54.251 --> 01:07:56.773]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:56.773 --> 01:08:01.356]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.025 --> 01:08:13.508]  By the way, we are simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv, the second, third, and fourth hour.
[01:08:13.508 --> 01:08:16.349]  Ron Paul coming up in the next hour.
[01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:21.532]  Going back to Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.
[01:08:21.532 --> 01:08:34.720]  If you just joined us, the Supreme Court, a year and a half ago, ruled that the Second Amendment is an individual right, as if we needed them to tell us this, but they had language in there about, but there can be reasonable restraints on it.
[01:08:36.198 --> 01:09:04.649]  And now they're saying, well, people have this right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, and claiming this federal power over the states, whereas where I look at it, it should be the state's decision through their state constitutions, but when that does violate the Bill of Rights, then the federal government and the Supreme Court does kick in, and Larry Pratt's an expert on this, so navigate this for us, Larry Pratt, and explain why are the gun-grabbing groups saying that they're somewhat happy
[01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:11.175]  Well, there's nothing in this suit coming out of Chicago that is going to jeopardize the licensing schemes of any of these local jurisdictions.
[01:09:27.088 --> 01:09:33.452]  And so, yes, the gun ban will be gone, but then the next challenge is going to be, oh, so you want a gun?
[01:09:33.452 --> 01:09:36.595]  Whatever made you think that would be easy?
[01:09:36.595 --> 01:09:40.797]  And, you know, there was a reporter after the D.C.
[01:09:40.797 --> 01:09:51.965]  gun ban fell, went through the process, took him six or seven months, $750 in fees and lessons that he had to take and all this kind of nonsense.
[01:09:52.828 --> 01:10:22.099]  and finally got his gun but it was something that as a matter of his job he was able to do most of us who have a nine-to-five and the bureaucrats probably work nine thirty to four thirty rots a rock getting over there and get in the papers and you know you have to take vacation time on top of everything else to try to go through this conflict and that's the way they like it and they make the fees high enough that it becomes prohibitive as they do in new york
[01:10:23.034 --> 01:10:28.977]  It makes it so complicated, you may need an attorney to navigate through the system.
[01:10:28.977 --> 01:10:35.881]  So the language is, again, okay, you do have a right, but we have a right to make it almost impossible to get one.
[01:10:35.881 --> 01:10:39.843]  So far, that's about all that we've accomplished.
[01:10:39.843 --> 01:10:41.644]  And, you know, it's progress.
[01:10:41.644 --> 01:10:43.545]  No more gun bans in D.C.
[01:10:43.545 --> 01:10:45.786]  No more, probably, in Chicago.
[01:10:46.446 --> 01:10:50.607]  A lot's going to hang on what Mr. Heller is doing.
[01:10:50.607 --> 01:10:58.309]  If he has a favorable outcome, then he's going to be junking the licensing scheme in the district.
[01:10:58.309 --> 01:11:14.172]  He's got another attorney, because the one that went up on his case the first time actually agreed with Justice Stevens that there is such a thing as reasonable infringement, which would include licensing.
[01:11:15.044 --> 01:11:17.326]  And, well, that was the ballgame.
[01:11:17.326 --> 01:11:26.592]  And even Scalia said, you know, we're not going to rule on the District of Columbia's licensing law because that was taken off the table by counsel.
[01:11:26.592 --> 01:11:33.556]  So, that was a very expensive decision that that attorney made.
[01:11:33.556 --> 01:11:37.118]  And actually, from what he said later, that's what he believes.
[01:11:37.118 --> 01:11:38.159]  He doesn't have a problem
[01:11:39.031 --> 01:11:41.313]  Philosophically, with licensing.
[01:11:41.313 --> 01:11:57.349]  And going back from memory, correct me if I'm wrong, the NRA came in and stuck their snout in the middle of the suit and was allowed to file briefs, and they were arguing in their filing that, yeah, you're allowed to make us get licenses and make it hard to get.
[01:11:57.349 --> 01:12:02.934]  We're just saying that if you can jump through a hundred flaming hoops and climb Mount Everest and
[01:12:03.815 --> 01:12:09.116]  If pigs can fly, then maybe sometime on a blue moon you can look at a gun.
[01:12:09.116 --> 01:12:15.257]  I mean, they basically agreed that yes, you can restrict, but there is sometimes a right.
[01:12:15.257 --> 01:12:26.679]  The NRA for a long time has taken a position that these kinds of, to use Stevens' term, reasonable infringements are acceptable.
[01:12:26.679 --> 01:12:30.340]  They were the ones who wrote the instant background check law.
[01:12:31.721 --> 01:12:34.824]  That was not something that the Brady's came up with.
[01:12:34.824 --> 01:12:38.368]  The NRA spearheaded the 1968 Gun Control Act.
[01:12:38.368 --> 01:12:40.991]  It was when the Brady Law was before Congress.
[01:12:40.991 --> 01:12:42.693]  It was originally a waiting period.
[01:12:43.457 --> 01:12:51.903]  And had it remain just that, Sheriff Mack's lawsuit would have overturned that and we would have had Zippo in this area.
[01:12:51.903 --> 01:12:54.985]  But instead they moved to an instant registration, again.
[01:12:54.985 --> 01:12:55.765]  Exactly.
[01:12:55.765 --> 01:13:01.549]  And that supplanted the waiting period after, I don't remember, four or five years.
[01:13:01.549 --> 01:13:04.151]  And that's what we're stuck with now.
[01:13:04.151 --> 01:13:11.816]  So they think inside a very small box and they're afraid to push back
[01:13:12.605 --> 01:13:33.497]  against the system because well they don't want to make the system mad at them and that's an attitude that's a risk that's a prescription for failure every time it's it's almost identical to the way most congressman think just want to sit there and kind of be nice and can't we all get along and and uh... it's kind of fun spending all this money anyway
[01:13:35.174 --> 01:13:38.176]  That's the business-as-usual attitude that we're up against.
[01:13:38.176 --> 01:13:39.296]  And it's killing us!
[01:13:39.296 --> 01:13:39.757]  It's killing us!
[01:13:39.757 --> 01:13:43.338]  Larry Pratt, Executive Director, Gun Owners of America, GunOwners.org.
[01:13:43.338 --> 01:13:46.180]  We've got it up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:53.064]  Links to it up on InfoWars.com for radio listeners who want to go visit the sites and find out more and sign up for your great free alerts.
[01:13:53.064 --> 01:13:55.305]  Let's get into some other areas.
[01:13:55.305 --> 01:13:56.726]  I look at national statistics.
[01:13:57.777 --> 01:14:06.586]  Roughly 50-50, 25 years ago, in polls, half the public was ignorant and said, oh yes, let's restrict guns.
[01:14:06.586 --> 01:14:15.535]  Now I see national polls of over 70% and growing every year say, get rid of all the gun laws, it only empowers criminals and a corrupt government.
[01:14:15.535 --> 01:14:19.539]  We're seeing record gun sales, we're seeing a lot of so-called liberals buying guns.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:26.966]  And we're also seeing Airsoft, which shoots a plastic safe BB, selling like hotcakes everywhere.
[01:14:26.966 --> 01:14:33.132]  I mean, they've got double aisles at Walmart and double aisles at Academy here in Austin, where I live.
[01:14:33.132 --> 01:14:37.716]  Every time I'm there, people are just all over the Airsoft aisle, snatching and grabbing.
[01:14:37.716 --> 01:14:40.138]  You know, I've bought a bunch of these.
[01:14:40.138 --> 01:14:42.100]  It's great marksmanship for your children.
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:43.741]  It's air-powered, very safe.
[01:14:44.642 --> 01:14:51.327]  It's a gateway for people into firearms who would be scared to even pick up a BB gun or then a real firearm.
[01:14:51.327 --> 01:14:56.670]  Studies show it's causing people to relearn to not be so scared of guns.
[01:14:56.670 --> 01:15:01.934]  And so now, all over Europe, all over England, Australia, Canada, they're banning them.
[01:15:01.934 --> 01:15:04.436]  And you know about the case in Cornelius, Oregon.
[01:15:04.436 --> 01:15:05.977]  We had the fellow on two days ago.
[01:15:06.257 --> 01:15:06.577]  Right.
[01:15:06.577 --> 01:15:10.158]  They seized $30,000, now they've seized $20,000 more.
[01:15:10.158 --> 01:15:11.118]  Totally legal.
[01:15:11.118 --> 01:15:11.738]  Replica.
[01:15:11.738 --> 01:15:12.859]  They look real.
[01:15:12.859 --> 01:15:16.540]  And the ATF agent says on TV, it looks scary.
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:18.960]  I'm not going to allow you to have this.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:25.262]  And he even got the ATF importation office to talk to them and tell them, you don't have authority.
[01:15:25.262 --> 01:15:27.342]  And the Oregon office said, we don't care.
[01:15:27.342 --> 01:15:29.123]  Obama's giving us backing.
[01:15:29.123 --> 01:15:30.823]  That's the key.
[01:15:30.823 --> 01:15:34.384]  I knew this was coming from the top as long as
[01:15:34.944 --> 01:15:36.906]  President Hussein is in office.
[01:15:36.906 --> 01:15:40.389]  We are going to see this kind of lawlessness.
[01:15:40.389 --> 01:15:48.897]  If a bureaucrat wants to do this kind of thing, he knows he will not be held accountable by the guy at the top.
[01:15:48.897 --> 01:15:51.720]  And so we're going to see more of this, I'm afraid.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.622]  Well, they're claiming that they have a ruling power.
[01:15:54.622 --> 01:15:57.285]  Same way they can say a semi-auto is really full-auto.
[01:15:57.285 --> 01:15:58.946]  Now, toy guns?
[01:15:58.946 --> 01:15:59.467]  Larry, I mean,
[01:16:00.387 --> 01:16:05.170]  I mean, aren't they wide open to serious lawsuits, but also, isn't it criminal?
[01:16:05.170 --> 01:16:06.171]  No paperwork either.
[01:16:06.171 --> 01:16:12.915]  They've grabbed two shipments, $50,000 worth, and just say, we're not talking to you, we're not giving you the paperwork, it's over.
[01:16:12.915 --> 01:16:14.496]  I mean, this is lawlessness.
[01:16:14.496 --> 01:16:19.479]  It's about as outrageous a behavior as we've seen perhaps since Waco.
[01:16:20.106 --> 01:16:32.095]  uh... these guys uh... are so clearly thinking that they are above the law they don't have to answer the phone they don't they've told the company that they don't have any obligation to
[01:16:32.908 --> 01:17:02.198]  uh... even talk to them or explain how the the company could make right quote-unquote uh... whatever it is that the what should brad martin do then i mean and this is the same as highway bandits robbing a stagecoach at this point well i talked to our federal affairs guys and i said look there's a couple things that i'd like to see us try to do let's get the heads of the uh... second amendment caucuses in the congress in the house in the senate to write some letters asking for an explanation
[01:17:02.984 --> 01:17:04.264]  Probably get stonewalled.
[01:17:04.264 --> 01:17:20.850]  Okay, then let's start looking for ways to put some zeros in the Customs budget, because the Customs actually was the doofus that got this thing started, and the ATF seems to be running cover for them, happily.
[01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:26.992]  So we can go in there and just zero out their enforcement offices in those particular cities.
[01:17:26.992 --> 01:17:28.473]  And then those guys are out of a job.
[01:17:28.473 --> 01:17:31.574]  I don't think they'll be volunteering to go to work.
[01:17:33.252 --> 01:17:51.197]  I mean, what's going on where the ATF comes into Austin, it's now been confirmed, and just ordered the Austin police chief to shut down this legal gun show, and they did it, by going to the landlord, to the owner, and just saying, we're going to charge you, or use nuisance abatement crack house laws on you.
[01:17:51.197 --> 01:18:02.400]  That would have been a frivolous lawsuit, but I can just see how the corporate attorney is thinking, my job is to save my employer, my client, hassle and money.
[01:18:02.765 --> 01:18:07.830]  And it's going to be a lot cheaper for him to lose this contract than it is to pay me to fight these jerks off.
[01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:12.375]  But isn't that the essence of racketeering and government color of law tyranny?
[01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:16.680]  Hitler didn't have a law to lock up Jewish businesses, he just did it!
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:23.307]  Well, you and I see that very clearly, and again, it's the lawlessness that we've come to expect
[01:18:23.717 --> 01:18:26.659]  from an administration that itself is lawless.
[01:18:26.659 --> 01:18:39.846]  Their answer, I can just hear the President now, if we were in that Blair House on another meeting talking about things like this, the most likely answer I would expect is a stony, I won.
[01:18:42.725 --> 01:18:45.407]  In other words, I can do anything I want, because I want.
[01:18:45.407 --> 01:18:48.109]  There are no laws that govern me.
[01:18:48.109 --> 01:18:53.713]  That's where we are in this country, and there are a lot of people that actually think that way too.
[01:18:53.713 --> 01:18:57.476]  Hey, he got elected, now we can do anything we want.
[01:18:57.476 --> 01:19:04.161]  So the idea that we're in a republic where a lot of things are going to be almost always off-bounds, off-limits,
[01:19:04.605 --> 01:19:10.568]  That, we've got at least two generations that hasn't been taught that in their government schools.
[01:19:10.568 --> 01:19:20.154]  Well, Larry Brandt, how dangerous of a precedent is it, they know there's not a lobby for toy guns, they're using the ATF that is a, you know, supposed
[01:19:22.495 --> 01:19:29.862]  Second Amendment regulating organization to outside their jurisdiction go after this as a direct attack on the Second Amendment.
[01:19:29.862 --> 01:19:32.764]  I mean clearly we've got to stand up and fight this.
[01:19:32.764 --> 01:19:40.712]  We do and I think that we have the soldiers in the Congress that once they become aware of this are going to want to do it.
[01:19:40.712 --> 01:19:47.017]  David Codria has written a very good piece in what is it called?
[01:19:47.017 --> 01:19:48.919]  Gun Rights Examiner on the web.
[01:19:49.386 --> 01:19:53.254]  And he includes an extensive report from the owner of his company.
[01:19:53.254 --> 01:19:54.777]  Alright, stay there, stay there.
[01:19:54.777 --> 01:19:59.787]  We're going to come back and talk about how we fight this and other attacks on the Second Amendment straight ahead.
[01:20:01.724 --> 01:20:06.346]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[01:22:00.922 --> 01:22:03.303]  Hi, this is Peter Krashnobyl with Midas Resources.
[01:22:03.303 --> 01:22:08.066]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high, and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[01:22:08.066 --> 01:22:14.690]  The multiple federal stimulus packages have been an utter failure, unless you're an executive for AIG, a large banking or investment institution.
[01:22:14.690 --> 01:22:17.192]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[01:22:17.192 --> 01:22:19.773]  People like you and I can't go to Washington for a bailout.
[01:22:19.773 --> 01:22:24.936]  Having your hard-earned money in the stock market or any other related paper asset is a lose-lose proposition.
[01:22:24.936 --> 01:22:26.277]  Lose on your capital investment,
[01:22:26.397 --> 01:22:26.957]  We're good to go.
[01:22:45.322 --> 01:22:45.623]  We're good.
[01:23:02.606 --> 01:23:04.247]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[01:23:04.247 --> 01:23:15.675]  Crowded public places, global pandemics, and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder... What if there was a germ-killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[01:23:15.675 --> 01:23:16.655]  There is!
[01:23:16.655 --> 01:23:20.378]  It's called Sinophresh Homeopathic Nasal Spray, and it's a proven germ killer.

[01:23:58.768 --> 01:24:00.289]  It works.
[01:24:00.289 --> 01:24:00.409]  Oh.
[01:24:07.455 --> 01:24:10.778]  Larry Pratt, Executive Director, Gun Owners of America.
[01:24:10.778 --> 01:24:11.919]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:24:11.919 --> 01:24:14.420]  Thanks for joining us, listeners and viewers.
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:26.130]  Southern Poverty Law Center put out a bunch of reports last month attacking myself, Michelle Bachman, Tom Tancredo, Larry Pratt, Oath Keepers, Sheriff Mack,
[01:24:27.176 --> 01:24:38.144]  And with some of the things we cover, a little more racy than these other groups, but when you start going after Larry Pratt and Michelle Bachman, a very popular congresswoman from Minnesota...
[01:24:39.295 --> 01:24:40.475]  They're really getting desperate.
[01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:45.217]  And every night on MSNBC, you don't like government health care, you're racist.
[01:24:45.217 --> 01:24:47.798]  You don't want big government, you're racist.
[01:24:47.798 --> 01:24:51.259]  You don't want gun control, you're anti-semitic.
[01:24:51.259 --> 01:24:58.722]  I think the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center, Larry, are really destroying any tiny shreds of credibility they have with anybody.
[01:24:58.722 --> 01:25:00.042]  They are so desperate.
[01:25:00.042 --> 01:25:04.124]  They have shown that their thought processes seem to have atrophied.
[01:25:04.779 --> 01:25:12.124]  And pretty soon we can just put them in some museum where we have other mummies and things like that.
[01:25:12.124 --> 01:25:17.768]  I mean, these guys are just absolutely without any arguments.
[01:25:17.768 --> 01:25:26.314]  So they are resorting to, that's different, that's their most polite put down when you make a point that devastates their position.
[01:25:26.314 --> 01:25:28.835]  Well, my position's different.
[01:25:28.835 --> 01:25:31.577]  And the other is, of course, you're racist.
[01:25:31.577 --> 01:25:33.899]  And as you say, you see it nightly on
[01:25:34.691 --> 01:25:40.819]  MSNBC, so if you want to see how liberals play that, I should say socialists, watch there.
[01:25:40.819 --> 01:25:51.251]  I kind of enjoy watching MSNBC because it's a first-hand newsletter report from the Communist Party USA.
[01:25:53.502 --> 01:25:55.644]  So I know what the enemy's going to be doing.
[01:25:55.644 --> 01:26:03.633]  And if I want to know what they're up to on socializing medicine and their latest little stratagem trying to get it through the Congress, just turn to me.
[01:26:03.633 --> 01:26:11.082]  You get their talking points right there, but we've also caught them, and Curt Nemo has an article about this up on InfoWars today.
[01:26:12.063 --> 01:26:15.666]  You'll have 5,000, 10,000, sometimes 100,000 at a tea party.
[01:26:15.666 --> 01:26:20.250]  They'll send one of their operatives in with a racist sign, and they put that on the news.
[01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:23.492]  Then people search their name and find out it's one of their operatives.
[01:26:23.492 --> 01:26:32.019]  I mean, this is really desperate-type activity, and they're getting so upset that there's all these black people and Hispanics and Oath Keepers.
[01:26:32.019 --> 01:26:33.140]  I mean, look at the front page.
[01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:35.642]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:26:35.642 --> 01:26:39.785]  They're getting so upset that there's all these brown people at tea parties.
[01:26:39.785 --> 01:26:41.187]  I mean, they are really panicking.
[01:26:41.787 --> 01:26:45.628]  Well, I was just delighted when the attack came out.
[01:26:45.628 --> 01:26:57.251]  I thought, you know, how can it get any better than this when I get lumped in with Michelle Bachmann and all these other cast of characters that are leading the fight for freedom?
[01:26:57.251 --> 01:27:04.892]  That was a good day, and I don't know if they will ever understand how truly pleased and honored I am.
[01:27:04.892 --> 01:27:10.714]  And for them to think that they're hurting us, all they're doing is, as you say, showing that they've lost it.
[01:27:11.654 --> 01:27:17.076]  They really have lost it, and we can, as they like to say, we can move on now.
[01:27:17.076 --> 01:27:19.017]  Well, here's another reason they're being discredited.
[01:27:19.017 --> 01:27:30.542]  POTOC, and it's in some of the reports they're putting out on a weekly basis, was up on MSNBC a few nights ago, we played it yesterday, and he said, these crazy Tea Party people believe a world government's being formed.
[01:27:30.542 --> 01:27:33.363]  Well, you've got Brown, Gore, Herman Van Rompuy,
[01:27:34.143 --> 01:27:46.871]  Uh, the head of the UN, Van Kimen in the New York Times with a headline, We Can Do It, calling for world government, calling for global carbon taxes, and then POTOC gets up and says we're conspiracy theorists, we believe there's carbon taxes.
[01:27:46.871 --> 01:27:55.035]  I mean, it's like saying, Larry Pratt's crazy, and Alex Jones is crazy, they say the sun comes up in the morning.
[01:27:55.035 --> 01:27:55.776]  Exactly.
[01:27:55.776 --> 01:27:59.598]  It doesn't matter what you say, you're nuts, you're a racist, and uh,
[01:28:00.607 --> 01:28:07.590]  They hope people might buy that, but they ought to take a look at their business model because it's not working too well.
[01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:15.514]  And who knows when, will it be this year, that the New York Times stops publishing a print newspaper and maybe remains as a
[01:28:16.054 --> 01:28:22.840]  A little vestige of its former self online, where nobody will bump into it, even accidentally.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:23.740]  I don't know.
[01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:24.201]  That's right.
[01:28:24.201 --> 01:28:33.268]  If you go to Alexa.com, all the web ratings, New York Times going down, The Nation going, all these globalist publications are going down.
[01:28:33.268 --> 01:28:40.554]  Anything that's patriotic and pro-liberties exploding, like we have rockets tied to our backs, and they're just destroying themselves.
[01:28:40.554 --> 01:28:43.937]  They're setting themselves on fire, immolating themselves in front of us.
[01:28:45.277 --> 01:28:51.139]  I made one misguess on what Obama was like.
[01:28:51.139 --> 01:28:53.659]  I knew he was a Marxist before the election.
[01:28:53.659 --> 01:28:55.680]  I knew he was a thug.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:03.081]  But I did think he would be more of a Fabian, more of that turtle mascot of theirs, moving more deliberately.
[01:29:03.081 --> 01:29:09.823]  But instead, he can't move fast enough to socialize everything that he can get his hands on.
[01:29:10.342 --> 01:29:21.629]  And it's, I think, for the first time, many people in this country now understand that liberalism has been a smiley face covering the reality of socialism.
[01:29:21.629 --> 01:29:24.011]  And now they see it in all its ugliness.
[01:29:24.918 --> 01:29:29.982]  And they write all these news articles implying guns are illegal to create a false perception.
[01:29:29.982 --> 01:29:31.183]  It's not working.
[01:29:31.183 --> 01:29:32.084]  They've been exposed.
[01:29:32.084 --> 01:29:34.586]  Folks, check out gunowners.org.

[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:12.948]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[01:33:30.033 --> 01:33:33.394]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:33:33.394 --> 01:33:42.517]  Jason Burmess is going to pop in for about 10 minutes towards the end of the hour to break down the Cyber Security Act.
[01:33:42.517 --> 01:33:48.439]  Later, after Ron Paul leaves us, I want to get into Coffee Party founder is Obama campaign operative.
[01:33:49.352 --> 01:33:55.195]  Now, we announced two months ago, and got the domains a month ago, that I was going to launch a coffee party.
[01:33:55.195 --> 01:34:09.564]  And I'm not going to go out and organize, I'm not going to go out and actually have rallies, just to put the idea out, break down what the coffee party should do, wake up the Tea Party, that it's being taken over by Republicans, controlled establishment partisanship.
[01:34:11.923 --> 01:34:15.066]  And that the Republicans are going to sell us out.
[01:34:15.066 --> 01:34:22.614]  Now we know Obama is, and now one of his operatives is setting this up and getting all this attention by the media to head off our coffee party.
[01:34:22.614 --> 01:34:27.098]  I should have, I knew I should launch this and it was listeners' ideas.
[01:34:27.879 --> 01:34:31.941]  A few other people, since they heard about it, have launched similar things, but it's not getting media attention.
[01:34:31.941 --> 01:34:33.782]  We're launching a site in the next few days.
[01:34:33.782 --> 01:34:37.924]  We're going to have some articles about it tomorrow.
[01:34:37.924 --> 01:34:46.028]  And I've got to get together with Watson and Nemo and kind of write up 15, 20 points of why we're doing this and what a real tea party should be.
[01:34:46.028 --> 01:34:47.709]  Hence, the coffee party.
[01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:49.730]  Stronger than tea.
[01:34:49.730 --> 01:34:53.292]  Because we're in serious times.
[01:34:53.292 --> 01:34:54.072]  That is coming up.
[01:34:57.921 --> 01:35:13.706]  There's also another piece that Paul Watson has where the mainstream media is demonizing anybody that questions the swine flu shot, saying that we believe that it's space alien DNA.
[01:35:13.706 --> 01:35:21.508]  No, we read the package that says it can cause cancer or sterilize you or cause Guillain-Barre syndrome or other neurological disorders.
[01:35:22.464 --> 01:35:27.086]  And it's now come out the whole thing was a hoax, a fraud to make money, that it's a dangerous vaccine.
[01:35:27.086 --> 01:35:33.869]  We've had the head of the 47-member commission of the EU on, a doctor, breaking down the fraud of this.
[01:35:33.869 --> 01:35:37.871]  And it's blown up in their face, so now they're running government-funded PSAs demonizing people.
[01:35:37.871 --> 01:35:40.792]  That's coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:35:40.792 --> 01:35:42.653]  But first, I wanted to get into this.
[01:35:42.653 --> 01:35:44.174]  I mean, this is so outrageous.
[01:35:44.174 --> 01:35:48.276]  It's an InfoWars.com article by Aaron Dykes.
[01:35:49.477 --> 01:35:59.422]  And he has a larger YouTube video he put together with some of the history of China's one-child policy and what they do to women in China, the forced abortions, the rest of it.
[01:35:59.422 --> 01:36:01.023]  Mao killed, according to the U.S.
[01:36:01.023 --> 01:36:03.764]  government, 64 million people.
[01:36:03.764 --> 01:36:09.787]  The Chinese government says he killed more than 80 million, but they're proud of it.
[01:36:09.787 --> 01:36:11.288]  He broke up families.
[01:36:11.288 --> 01:36:14.290]  He put tens of millions of people in slave camps.
[01:36:14.290 --> 01:36:18.072]  I mean, this guy turned loose youth corps on the population.
[01:36:18.976 --> 01:36:21.698]  In the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward.
[01:36:21.698 --> 01:36:26.381]  This guy forced tens of millions of farmers off their land, poor farmers, and killed them.
[01:36:26.381 --> 01:36:29.183]  He made Stalin look like a choir boy.
[01:36:29.183 --> 01:36:38.709]  And to have CNN talking about how great communism is and how great Mao Zedong is, that's like in my film, Endgame, we have the actual New York Times article.
[01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:40.470]  We went to UT and got it.
[01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:42.211]  Some of our researchers did.
[01:36:42.211 --> 01:36:45.574]  We should shoot video of us at the UT library getting the actual microfish
[01:36:46.414 --> 01:36:50.798]  New York Times, him praising Mao Zedong in 1976.
[01:36:50.798 --> 01:36:52.979]  And saying how great Mao Zedong is.
[01:36:52.979 --> 01:36:54.941]  And how we need that in America.
[01:36:54.941 --> 01:36:57.943]  Why would some of the richest people in the world want communism?
[01:36:57.943 --> 01:37:01.066]  Because they take your money and they organize and run your life.
[01:37:01.066 --> 01:37:05.449]  They break up the family and they give the money and power to themselves.
[01:37:05.449 --> 01:37:06.750]  That's the big dirty secret here.
[01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:11.394]  Look at how our banks and government and corporations have moved almost all our power to China.
[01:37:11.394 --> 01:37:14.757]  Because they're the globalist model of the controlled society.
[01:37:16.138 --> 01:37:26.589]  So this article from Infowars.com titled, CNN Tells Masses That Communism Is Good For Women Despite China's Nightmare Legacy.
[01:37:26.589 --> 01:37:30.613]  And so you watch the short video clip and then you can read through a rundown.
[01:37:30.613 --> 01:37:31.734]  It's a pretty detailed article.
[01:37:32.597 --> 01:37:41.483]  of what's really going on in China and he's got some extra video clips that are more extensive than what we're about to play here right now.
[01:37:41.483 --> 01:37:46.866]  But here it is, CNN tells masses communism has been good for women.
[01:37:46.866 --> 01:37:48.987]  Oh yes, oh women were slaves in the home.
[01:37:48.987 --> 01:37:51.429]  No, women could work in China if they wanted to.
[01:37:51.429 --> 01:37:56.432]  But in the internal government documents from Britain and the US a hundred years ago, Edward Bernays and others
[01:37:58.064 --> 01:38:02.305]  Said, and it's now been declassified, Gloria Steinem has admitted she was hired by the CIA with Ms.
[01:38:02.305 --> 01:38:03.025]  Magazine.
[01:38:03.025 --> 01:38:04.886]  How do we tax women as well?
[01:38:04.886 --> 01:38:18.849]  How do we get them in the workforce so we can tax people to such a high level families break up and so the state can raise children?
[01:38:18.849 --> 01:38:21.609]  So this is where they force you to work.
[01:38:21.609 --> 01:38:23.490]  They turn you into a slave.
[01:38:24.528 --> 01:38:30.710]  And here's CNN talking about how wonderful Communist China is, how great it is.
[01:38:30.710 --> 01:38:38.053]  And they've got little blue Obama books for the school kids now, like Mao Zedong's little red book.
[01:38:38.053 --> 01:38:39.914]  So let's go ahead and play a short clip of CNN.
[01:38:39.914 --> 01:38:40.274]  Here it is.
[01:38:42.783 --> 01:38:54.690]  Chen Zhe Li is the president of the All-China Women's Federation, one of the top-ranking women in the Chinese government, and witness to the major changes in women's status since the Communist Revolution.
[01:38:56.701 --> 01:39:05.868]  Among the first laws passed by Chairman Mao's government were statutes banning foot-binding, bride-selling, dowry, polygamy and concubines.
[01:39:05.868 --> 01:39:10.171]  Women were invited to leave the home and join the labor force.
[01:39:10.171 --> 01:39:15.815]  Mao spoke those famous words, women hold up half the sky.
[01:39:15.815 --> 01:39:22.780]  If the statistics are any indication, communism has been good for women.
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:24.381]  Okay.
[01:39:24.381 --> 01:39:24.581]  Now.
[01:39:26.724 --> 01:39:32.408]  They attach some good things for women to this piece and make it sound like Mao was a great guy.
[01:39:32.408 --> 01:39:37.691]  Women have forced abortions, which Obama supports.
[01:39:37.691 --> 01:39:39.712]  They follow the eugenics model.
[01:39:39.712 --> 01:39:41.713]  It's why they've been industrialized.
[01:39:43.504 --> 01:39:44.665]  Agreements with the U.S.
[01:39:44.665 --> 01:39:49.487]  government and Richard Nixon and George Bush, the Chinese ambassador from the U.S., the U.S.
[01:39:49.487 --> 01:39:51.409]  ambassador to China, to do this.
[01:39:51.409 --> 01:39:52.809]  They launched it in 75.
[01:39:52.809 --> 01:39:55.771]  By 81, it was forced abortion, one-child policy.
[01:39:55.771 --> 01:39:59.193]  Now, they proposed three months ago at Copenhagen and the U.N.
[01:39:59.193 --> 01:40:03.215]  a similar system for here in the United States.
[01:40:03.215 --> 01:40:12.501]  And the White House science czar and countless others, in fact, I'm looking for my eco-science, calls for sterilizing you through vaccines,
[01:40:13.848 --> 01:40:16.370]  Through poison in the water.
[01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:19.072]  This is the type of stuff that's being pushed.
[01:40:19.072 --> 01:40:21.474]  And a lot of yuppies say, oh yeah, there are too many people.
[01:40:21.474 --> 01:40:24.476]  Yeah, but they're poisoning your water too.
[01:40:24.476 --> 01:40:26.097]  52% of black people never get born.
[01:40:26.097 --> 01:40:27.698]  They get killed.
[01:40:27.698 --> 01:40:30.921]  And the left's the ones always, the controlled corporate left, pushing it.
[01:40:32.691 --> 01:40:47.785]  This is so diabolical, ladies and gentlemen, that we've come to the point where Mao Zedong, the greatest mass murderer in all of recorded history, no one has killed more than Mao Zedong, no one debates that, is praised.
[01:40:47.785 --> 01:40:50.007]  Is praised.
[01:40:50.007 --> 01:40:58.355]  Shifting gears, Paul Joseph Watson wrote an article about the government running demonization pieces
[01:41:00.132 --> 01:41:03.535]  In fact, will you guys pull it up because for some reason I couldn't see it in my stack.
[01:41:03.535 --> 01:41:08.398]  I thought I printed it today.
[01:41:08.398 --> 01:41:12.861]  Demonizing anyone who doesn't think the vaccine is good for you.
[01:41:12.861 --> 01:41:15.303]  It's kind of like those corn syrup ads you've seen.
[01:41:15.303 --> 01:41:19.045]  All the studies show it links to diabetes.
[01:41:19.045 --> 01:41:23.949]  All the studies show it's got mercury in it for some reason.
[01:41:25.745 --> 01:41:27.105]  That's Washington Post.
[01:41:27.105 --> 01:41:32.126]  More than, or right at half of corn syrup products have mercury in it.
[01:41:32.126 --> 01:41:36.087]  But they run an ad where the woman's the expert and the man's always an idiot.
[01:41:36.087 --> 01:41:42.309]  Or another neighbor woman's over and the woman explains to her she's a moron that corn syrup's wonderful.
[01:41:42.309 --> 01:41:43.069]  Why do they do that?
[01:41:43.069 --> 01:41:45.290]  Not because women are stupid.
[01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:46.410]  Why do they target women?
[01:41:46.410 --> 01:41:51.031]  They target women because women make over 80% of the household purchases in all the major studies.
[01:41:52.409 --> 01:41:54.951]  And so they know women are the ones reading the back labels.
[01:41:54.951 --> 01:42:01.276]  Notice you can't buy chewing gum now in any store that I've seen that doesn't have aspartame in it, even if it's not sugar-free.
[01:42:01.276 --> 01:42:02.197]  What is aspartame?
[01:42:02.197 --> 01:42:16.408]  It's a genetically engineered E. coli bacteria that they feed toxic waste to, I'm not kidding, that then defecates a poisonous drug that is addictive that is also 61 times sweeter than sugar per gram.
[01:42:16.408 --> 01:42:17.088]  Oh, you don't believe me?
[01:42:17.088 --> 01:42:20.491]  Just search into the term manufacturing process of aspartame.
[01:42:21.863 --> 01:42:29.829]  It is the excrement of a genetically engineered bacteria.
[01:42:29.829 --> 01:42:39.677]  The Pentagon was trying to study chemical weapons in the 60s and came up with this, and they gave it to Donald Rumsfeld at Searle and Monsanto to come out with this.
[01:42:39.677 --> 01:42:42.460]  And I could just go on and on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:46.103]  It is an addictive chemical weapon, and they know it.
[01:42:46.103 --> 01:42:51.347]  But hey, they run all these ads explaining, you're kooks, you're crazy, but they wouldn't be running these ads saying,
[01:42:52.719 --> 01:42:55.840]  E. coli poop is good.
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:59.382]  They wouldn't be running ads saying mercury is good for your brain.
[01:42:59.382 --> 01:43:08.206]  They wouldn't be running ads saying that all these toxic substances were good if people weren't waking up.
[01:43:08.206 --> 01:43:11.707]  And the federal government's dished out money to all the states to run these.
[01:43:11.707 --> 01:43:14.288]  This is this particular clip out of Kentucky.
[01:43:14.288 --> 01:43:16.650]  There's a bunch of states running different variants of these.
[01:43:20.089 --> 01:43:28.791]  If you question the vaccines and think anything in it's bad, you believe in space aliens and that the vaccine is space alien genetics.
[01:43:28.791 --> 01:43:32.132]  So we're gonna go ahead and play this clip.
[01:43:32.132 --> 01:43:39.153]  Remember how during the whole swine flu freak out, they would issue fact sheets going, there's no mercury, it can't sterilize you, it can't hurt you.
[01:43:39.153 --> 01:43:43.914]  Then the actual insert that came with the drugs says it does.
[01:43:43.914 --> 01:43:47.175]  So let's go ahead and play this clip, here it is.
[01:43:51.007 --> 01:43:54.790]  Well, I hear the H1N1 swine flu vaccine's made from platypus milk.
[01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:55.430]  No, no, no.
[01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:59.033]  It was brought through a portal that only opens every 700 years.
[01:43:59.033 --> 01:44:00.474]  My cousin sent me an email.
[01:44:00.474 --> 01:44:04.777]  Says it makes you susceptible to hypnotic suggestion.
[01:44:04.777 --> 01:44:06.618]  Some folks believe anything.
[01:44:06.618 --> 01:44:10.701]  The swine flu vaccine is safe, effective, and you still need it.
[01:44:10.701 --> 01:44:12.942]  Learn more at Kentucky's flu website.
[01:44:12.942 --> 01:44:15.724]  That way you can separate the fact from the fiction.
[01:44:15.724 --> 01:44:19.387]  It was developed from secret alien technology found on the moon.
[01:44:22.230 --> 01:44:25.553]  No one is saying any of that.
[01:44:25.553 --> 01:44:38.524]  We're having medical doctors on, and the head of the EU Commission on, who found that Big Pharma made hundreds of millions of payoffs to regulators in the EU, England, the United States, and Canada.
[01:44:38.524 --> 01:44:43.588]  That it is a dangerous vaccine that the German government and military wouldn't even take.
[01:44:43.588 --> 01:44:44.289]  In fact, pull that up.
[01:44:44.289 --> 01:44:46.791]  German military gets added a free vaccine.
[01:44:52.981 --> 01:44:59.165]  We could pull up 31% of homeless given bird flu vaccine die.
[01:44:59.165 --> 01:45:00.105]  London Telegraph.
[01:45:00.105 --> 01:45:02.927]  I mean, the people are dying and getting sick.
[01:45:02.927 --> 01:45:05.449]  The Gardasil shot's killing masses of people.
[01:45:05.449 --> 01:45:07.290]  It's admitted it's killing people.
[01:45:07.290 --> 01:45:09.832]  The Anthrax shot's killed tons of our troops.
[01:45:09.832 --> 01:45:13.013]  The Pentagon even found that nine years ago.
[01:45:13.013 --> 01:45:14.675]  They admitted it and stopped giving it.
[01:45:14.675 --> 01:45:15.975]  But no, we're space aliens.
[01:45:17.762 --> 01:45:18.643]  That's all they do.
[01:45:18.643 --> 01:45:24.949]  And they have the Southern Poverty Law Center gets up on TV and says, you believe in space aliens if, you know, you believe there's a world government.
[01:45:24.949 --> 01:45:28.133]  Let's bring Jason Bermas in here, please.
[01:45:28.133 --> 01:45:29.754]  It's now time for him to be on.
[01:45:31.196 --> 01:45:41.282]  I wanted to sit back into this segment and the rest of the next segment to have Jason just read over the bill, because it seems like the mainstream media doesn't even know what's in this Cybersecurity Act.
[01:45:41.282 --> 01:45:44.824]  Then Ron Paul is coming up.
[01:45:44.824 --> 01:45:46.645]  Talk right into that microphone, Burmess.
[01:45:46.645 --> 01:45:47.365]  Thank you.
[01:45:47.365 --> 01:45:54.109]  Jason's done a lot of research on this, and I meant to cover this yesterday, but Jason, you've got the floor at the end of this segment, the next segment, so go over it for us.
[01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:55.509]  Well, thanks so much, Alex.
[01:45:55.509 --> 01:45:59.752]  What's being set up here is not only a federal
[01:46:00.632 --> 01:46:05.836]  Cyber security program, but also a localized cyber security program.
[01:46:05.836 --> 01:46:16.604]  And this kind of hearkened back to you going to SeaWorld and talking about how you are going to be trained from kindergarten up to work on these little mindless computers and surveil everybody.
[01:46:16.604 --> 01:46:18.085]  And that's what this is.
[01:46:18.085 --> 01:46:24.870]  It literally states that they are going to have scholarships for K through 12 students.
[01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.950]  So
[01:46:25.951 --> 01:46:38.740]  You as a parent will get a note home for your fourth grader that Tommy is going to be in the Junior Computer Genius Society, and he's going to do a summer internship for the federal government.
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:44.243]  And it says in here to get these scholarships, and we all know everybody wants a scholarship, everybody's going to need a grant.
[01:46:44.243 --> 01:46:48.886]  We're going into an economic depression, Alex, so everybody's going to clamor to these jobs.
[01:46:48.886 --> 01:46:55.331]  They're going to recruit the best and brightest to run the literal slave grid they've put into place.
[01:46:55.331 --> 01:46:55.431]  And
[01:46:56.111 --> 01:46:58.532]  What they're going to do is they're going to use front organizations.
[01:46:58.532 --> 01:47:00.892]  So they're going to use foundations, okay?
[01:47:00.892 --> 01:47:05.214]  They are going to use the smallest of businesses.
[01:47:05.214 --> 01:47:11.715]  In fact, they're targeting businesses with less than 100 people that they can't get under their thumb immediately with this bill.
[01:47:11.715 --> 01:47:13.356]  With, again, funding.
[01:47:13.356 --> 01:47:17.437]  And this also creates a society where if something is exposed, if they are exposed as
[01:47:18.257 --> 01:47:20.918]  Illegally wiretapping, surveilling someone illegally.
[01:47:20.918 --> 01:47:21.838]  They can localize it.
[01:47:21.838 --> 01:47:24.878]  They can say, no, it's just this foundation front.
[01:47:24.878 --> 01:47:29.239]  It's compartmentalization all in this bill.
[01:47:29.239 --> 01:47:29.999]  It's nightmarish.
[01:47:29.999 --> 01:47:34.180]  And the guest you had on yesterday literally said he had not read this thing.
[01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:40.602]  They're going to put the entire Internet under the control of the FCC and NIST.
[01:47:40.602 --> 01:47:45.603]  NIST, an organization that has now covered up what really happened at World Trade Center 1, 2, and 7.
[01:47:47.443 --> 01:47:49.884]  For over eight years, Alex.
[01:47:49.884 --> 01:47:59.568]  And with Barry Jennings, who was in Building 7 with the Director of Security, and said there were bombs going off, the fire department told him they saw it happen, then he mysteriously died very quickly.
[01:47:59.568 --> 01:48:02.810]  Now they're saying they have the recordings of these interviews, but they're not going to release them.
[01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:03.810]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:12.894]  In fact, this week, somebody got the response from their FOIA request to get the recordings of both Michael Hess and Barry Jennings from NIST's own investigation.
[01:48:12.894 --> 01:48:16.476]  They admitted in the documents, oh, these do exist, but they're exempt.
[01:48:16.696 --> 01:48:17.676]  National security.
[01:48:17.676 --> 01:48:18.457]  National security.
[01:48:18.457 --> 01:48:25.740]  Well, they give out the little, they don't actually say national security, they say the little subdivisions, so you have to go look up the clause, but there's four separate clauses on each one.
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:27.060]  And they give this national security clause.
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:27.941]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:27.941 --> 01:48:36.824]  It's unbelievable to me that we would put NIST, NIST, and the FCC in charge of the internet, that we would allow the federal government to come in.
[01:48:36.824 --> 01:48:39.586]  And the new FCC head has said they will control the internet.
[01:48:39.586 --> 01:48:41.186]  Oh, this is full of internet.
[01:48:41.186 --> 01:48:42.287]  We'll start going over it quickly.
[01:48:42.287 --> 01:48:42.547]  Alright.
[01:48:43.467 --> 01:48:59.988]  So, they're going to create a high-level panel that shall advise the president on matters relating to national cybersecurity program and strategy and shall assess trends and developments in cybersecurity science research and development, progress made in implementing the strategy, the way to revise the strategy, and at the very end...
[01:49:00.509 --> 01:49:05.034]  They say, whether societal and civil liberty concerns are adequately addressed.
[01:49:05.034 --> 01:49:14.343]  Nothing about the Constitution, nothing about the Bill of Rights, nothing about our inherent human rights to be able to live free in our persons and properties, Alex.
[01:49:14.343 --> 01:49:21.990]  Instead, they're going to address the societal and civil liberty concerns, and make sure those concerns are adequately addressed.
[01:49:22.776 --> 01:49:28.460]  Folks, the Constitution and Bill of Rights are being ripped up and torn apart with this bill.
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:31.162]  Support of regional cybersecurity.
[01:49:31.162 --> 01:49:34.225]  So they're going to get into the business of your counties.
[01:49:34.225 --> 01:49:35.926]  It's not just going to be state and federal.
[01:49:35.926 --> 01:49:39.889]  Again, they're going after every major hub.
[01:49:39.889 --> 01:49:40.729]  All networks.
[01:49:40.729 --> 01:49:43.812]  This is total control of the internet.
[01:49:44.272 --> 01:49:49.073]  The regional centers are for the promotion and implementation of cybersecurity standards.
[01:49:49.073 --> 01:49:53.755]  Each center shall be affiliated with the United States-based non-profit institution or organization.
[01:49:53.755 --> 01:49:56.575]  These are the front groups that they're going to be putting together.
[01:49:56.575 --> 01:50:02.557]  Or a consortium thereof that applies for and is awarded financial assistance under this section.
[01:50:03.573 --> 01:50:09.178]  Now they're also going to standardize all software and hardware under NIST.
[01:50:09.178 --> 01:50:20.047]  The transfer of cybersecurity standards, process technology, and techniques developed in the National Institute of Standards and Technology, two centers, and through them, small, medium-sized companies throughout the United States.
[01:50:20.047 --> 01:50:20.988]  It's everybody.
[01:50:20.988 --> 01:50:24.091]  And you have to have a federally approved person in your business.
[01:50:24.091 --> 01:50:26.493]  Everything has to have government software running on it.
[01:50:26.493 --> 01:50:29.055]  They're totally taking over the infrastructure of the Internet.
[01:50:29.295 --> 01:50:36.884]  Absolutely, and that's why they want the K-12 students so that they can actually certify them while they're still in school and then recruit them immediately out of high school.
[01:50:36.884 --> 01:50:37.424]  Immediately.
[01:50:47.936 --> 01:50:48.677]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:48.677 --> 01:50:53.960]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:55.261]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:10.531]  We're good to go.
[01:51:23.991 --> 01:51:31.096]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[01:52:59.458 --> 01:53:00.019]  Wow!
[01:53:01.351 --> 01:53:02.011]  Hello!
[01:53:02.011 --> 01:53:06.774]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[01:53:06.774 --> 01:53:11.597]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[01:53:11.597 --> 01:53:16.641]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:53:16.641 --> 01:53:21.323]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[01:53:21.323 --> 01:53:25.426]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[01:53:25.526 --> 01:53:29.888]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[01:53:29.888 --> 01:53:34.450]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[01:53:34.450 --> 01:53:36.630]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[01:53:36.630 --> 01:53:38.691]  I can't say enough about this book.
[01:53:38.691 --> 01:53:40.612]  Blessings to you and your family.
[01:53:40.612 --> 01:53:46.314]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[01:53:46.314 --> 01:53:49.736]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[01:53:49.736 --> 01:53:52.437]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[01:53:53.317 --> 01:54:06.808]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[01:54:06.808 --> 01:54:09.670]  This always seems to happen when Ron Paul's on the hill.
[01:54:09.670 --> 01:54:11.091]  We were gonna get 30 minutes with him.
[01:54:11.091 --> 01:54:11.932]  We're getting 15.
[01:54:11.932 --> 01:54:12.773]  He's gotta go to a vote.
[01:54:15.339 --> 01:54:26.268]  Sure, I just want to go over how all software configuration will go through NIST, through the FCC, through the Department of Homeland Security that was absorbed by the NSA and really set up by the NSA as a domestic spy front for all United States citizens.
[01:54:40.356 --> 01:54:57.904]  Okay, so now all software will have to be an established standard of computer-readable language for completely specifying the configuration of software on computer systems, widely used in federal government, by government contractors and grantees, and in the private sector-owned critical infrastructure.
[01:54:57.904 --> 01:55:00.946]  And of course, all of the major private sector is
[01:55:01.186 --> 01:55:02.167]  We're good to go.
[01:55:19.969 --> 01:55:27.011]  I mean, it's all here, Alex, and there will be national compliance standards for all software.
[01:55:27.011 --> 01:55:28.631]  So they don't like your software?
[01:55:28.631 --> 01:55:30.292]  Forget about antitrust.
[01:55:30.292 --> 01:55:33.433]  You won't be able to compete in the system because they won't allow it.
[01:55:33.433 --> 01:55:36.954]  They'll just rip it off and put it under a Microsoft or Mac brand.
[01:55:37.782 --> 01:55:40.703]  And unfortunately, the public is going to clamor for it.
[01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:57.153]  Over 94% of the people were against it.
[01:55:57.153 --> 01:56:00.616]  How is this a representation of we the people?
[01:56:00.616 --> 01:56:01.516]  It's not.
[01:56:01.516 --> 01:56:02.998]  International standards.
[01:56:02.998 --> 01:56:13.106]  The director through the institute and in coordination with appropriate federal agencies shall be responsible for the United States representation in all international standards development related to cyber security.
[01:56:13.106 --> 01:56:14.608]  So I guess we should be like China.
[01:56:15.208 --> 01:56:19.031]  I guess we should move towards Australia-style censored internet.
[01:56:19.031 --> 01:56:19.911]  That's what's in here.
[01:56:19.911 --> 01:56:21.653]  Well, CNN says Mao's good.
[01:56:21.653 --> 01:56:24.154]  He killed more people than anybody in history, but he's good.
[01:56:24.154 --> 01:56:26.296]  Think of the outrageousness of that.
[01:56:26.296 --> 01:56:26.756]  Absolutely.
[01:56:26.756 --> 01:56:38.364]  And in Invisible Empire, we cover how on the 60th anniversary of Mao and his communist regime, we decided to light up the Empire State Building in those communist colors because we love them so much, Alex.
[01:56:38.364 --> 01:56:39.045]  That's disgusting.
[01:56:39.525 --> 01:56:45.869]  But then meanwhile neocons criticize me for going on Russia Today and talking bad about communism.
[01:56:45.869 --> 01:56:49.811]  When the neocons were founded by the Trotskyites and are communist.
[01:56:49.811 --> 01:56:50.692]  You just can't win.
[01:56:50.692 --> 01:56:53.734]  The communists can literally kill millions of people in history.
[01:56:53.734 --> 01:56:58.217]  Our government created the communists and the UN on record.
[01:56:58.217 --> 01:57:00.478]  Our government is a bunch of banks.
[01:57:00.478 --> 01:57:02.620]  People better figure this out fast.
[01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:05.181]  And they don't like Russia because they kicked the communists out.
[01:57:05.181 --> 01:57:05.842]  That's true.
[01:57:05.842 --> 01:57:07.723]  They kicked the Rothschild bankers out.
[01:57:08.644 --> 01:57:09.685]  On record.
[01:57:09.685 --> 01:57:11.627]  Let me just go over just a few more things of this.
[01:57:11.627 --> 01:57:15.791]  We've dirty, filthy commies out there, all you neocons saying I'm a commie.
[01:57:15.791 --> 01:57:18.474]  Everybody knows you're the scum!
[01:57:18.474 --> 01:57:22.698]  We've talked before about them regulating broadband internet.
[01:57:22.698 --> 01:57:25.941]  In other words, you're going to start paying per megabyte, per gigabyte.
[01:57:25.941 --> 01:57:29.165]  But the key there is once the government gives you free broadband that you pay for,
[01:57:30.362 --> 01:57:34.226]  Then the FCC says, because it's broadcast, they will control it and put their software in.
[01:57:34.226 --> 01:57:35.707]  That is where I'm going with this.
[01:57:35.707 --> 01:57:38.009]  Mandatory licensing through the FCC.
[01:57:38.009 --> 01:57:41.012]  So after they take it over, you'll have to get mandatory licensing.
[01:57:41.012 --> 01:57:47.938]  Look, look, look, look, I want to go to calls, but since Ron Paul's getting cut short today, just, at the 20 after, come in another 10 minutes.
[01:57:47.938 --> 01:57:51.401]  Because, I mean, I want to just start through the whole thing, run through it in one segment.
[01:57:51.601 --> 01:57:51.981]  Absolutely.
[01:58:14.241 --> 01:58:18.783]  Get the articles out to Curt Nimmo, Paul Watson of writtenforinfowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[01:58:18.783 --> 01:58:20.323]  We have a chance of turning this around.
[01:58:20.323 --> 01:58:21.924]  Absolutely, and this isn't a daunting bill.
[01:58:21.924 --> 01:58:23.545]  This is only 50 plus pages.
[01:58:23.545 --> 01:58:25.365]  I got through this in less than 20 minutes.
[01:58:25.365 --> 01:58:29.207]  As an American citizen, don't you think it's your duty to know what they're about to pass?
[01:58:29.207 --> 01:58:30.728]  Alright, we haven't even scratched the surface.
[01:58:30.728 --> 01:58:31.688]  Burmish will be back in here.
[01:58:31.688 --> 01:58:35.870]  I am going to have open phones and news blitz in the last hour and a half of the show.
[01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:39.111]  That's all coming up, but we'll see if Ron Paul is going to be joining us straight ahead.
[01:58:42.682 --> 01:58:45.943]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.943 --> 01:58:50.805]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.805 --> 01:58:55.346]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.346 --> 01:58:56.267]  Number one.
[01:58:56.267 --> 01:58:59.688]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.688 --> 01:59:00.548]  Number two.
[01:59:00.548 --> 01:59:05.430]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:06.190]  It's true.
[01:59:06.190 --> 01:59:11.052]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.052 --> 01:59:11.572]  Number three.
[01:59:11.872 --> 01:59:15.455]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.455 --> 01:59:20.178]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:20.178 --> 01:59:22.920]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:27.403]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:27.403 --> 01:59:31.546]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.546 --> 01:59:36.310]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.590 --> 01:59:40.752]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.752 --> 01:59:42.553]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.553 --> 01:59:44.814]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:44.814 --> 01:59:47.095]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:47.095 --> 01:59:48.016]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.016 --> 01:59:49.236]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:59:49.236 --> 01:59:49.597]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.026 --> 02:00:08.787]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.787 --> 02:00:10.548]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.548 --> 02:00:12.129]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.129 --> 02:00:13.689]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.689 --> 02:00:17.891]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.891 --> 02:00:21.933]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.601 --> 02:00:32.164]  We always look forward to our once a month visit with Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:00:32.164 --> 02:00:33.905]  He's gotta go in 14 minutes.
[02:00:33.905 --> 02:00:36.447]  I got my atomic clock to a key vote.
[02:00:36.447 --> 02:00:37.829]  Gotta be in a committee room.
[02:00:37.829 --> 02:00:38.789]  So he's with us now.
[02:00:38.789 --> 02:00:40.251]  I'm gonna move quickly.
[02:00:40.251 --> 02:00:43.974]  First off, Congressman, you won the straw poll at CPAC.
[02:00:45.175 --> 02:00:48.359]  Proving that most of the Republicans are not warmongering neocons.
[02:00:48.359 --> 02:00:50.782]  You got 84% approval rating in Texas.
[02:00:50.782 --> 02:00:53.565]  You won by a record 80% in the primary.
[02:00:53.565 --> 02:00:57.190]  Showing that America supports what you're doing.
[02:00:57.190 --> 02:01:01.676]  Can you comment on the fact that, well, your take on this?
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:10.427]  I was very pleased and somewhat surprised, but it was a delight to have won that CPAC vote.
[02:01:10.427 --> 02:01:14.991]  You know, what was interesting is, you know, the people who oppose us, they're still significant.
[02:01:14.991 --> 02:01:21.237]  If I get 32% of the vote, that means there's a large number still complaining, and they're part of the establishment.
[02:01:21.237 --> 02:01:25.941]  But what I thought was interesting is all the sour grapes that was expressed afterwards.
[02:01:25.941 --> 02:01:29.344]  They were complaining, and, oh, this is not for real, you know, like they did in the campaign.
[02:01:29.964 --> 02:01:38.429]  But what was interesting is somebody said that, you know, what we need to do is for CPAC to have any credibility, they have to change the way they vote.
[02:01:38.429 --> 02:01:50.595]  So somebody made the suggestion that nobody under 25 would be allowed to vote, which means, and you know it too, that there are a lot of young people who are interested in what we're talking about, and I think that's fortunate.
[02:01:50.595 --> 02:01:51.876]  You know, the next generation is
[02:01:52.456 --> 02:01:55.759]  Not later on, but currently they're inheriting this mess.
[02:01:55.759 --> 02:02:04.265]  So I'm delighted to talk to young people, but this whole idea that the people who don't like us challenging the status quo, well, let's not let them vote next time.
[02:02:04.265 --> 02:02:14.734]  But I think that there's a lot of people who are coming our way every year, and you know in the last two or three years that there's been tremendous growth in our movement, and that makes me very encouraged.
[02:02:15.811 --> 02:02:16.532]  Absolutely.
[02:02:16.532 --> 02:02:22.018]  I want to cut to the chase here and before we get into the banking situation.
[02:02:22.018 --> 02:02:29.206]  A few months ago you were speaking at a Campaign for Liberty event and you threw the gauntlet down as you did back in the 80s in some videos I've seen.
[02:02:29.206 --> 02:02:32.089]  You said we've had a CIA coup in America.
[02:02:32.089 --> 02:02:33.251]  They're bringing in the drugs.
[02:02:33.251 --> 02:02:34.392]  Most people don't know in 96 the CIA
[02:02:36.594 --> 02:02:40.616]  Inspector General before Congress admitted that, but it's wider than that.
[02:02:40.616 --> 02:03:02.043]  We know Wall Street and the banking cartel, the Federal Reserve System, through Yale and other outfits, set up the OSS and CIA, and you came right out and basically said this is our illegitimate government, and that ties into the banks engineering the financial collapse, now saying they're getting ready for an even bigger collapse sometime this year in a constitution of the world run by the banks.
[02:03:02.703 --> 02:03:10.529]  As Gordon Brown and others called for, can you specifically speak to who runs the coup, who they are, and how we remove them?
[02:03:10.529 --> 02:03:14.933]  Because by openly coming out and really telling it like it is, we can cut to the chase.
[02:03:15.336 --> 02:03:28.320]  Well, I have trouble naming names because I don't know all the names, but the one thing I can verify is that the people who should have responsibility for our national security and intelligence gathering, the U.S.
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:31.521]  Congress, they have no idea what's going on.
[02:03:31.521 --> 02:03:32.801]  And that's the real problem.
[02:03:33.457 --> 02:03:41.264]  And it fits together, you know, the secrecy of the CIA as well as the secrecy of the Fed.
[02:03:41.264 --> 02:03:43.786]  They control the money and they control secret government.
[02:03:43.786 --> 02:03:55.456]  People have referred to the CIA as a secret army for the president, but sometimes I wonder whether the president even has total control of the CIA as well, as many stories have been written about that.
[02:03:56.098 --> 02:04:01.383]  So it's something that I think the American people have to realize.
[02:04:01.383 --> 02:04:07.809]  We do know, there's been evidence brought forth that the CIA actually can own banks.
[02:04:07.809 --> 02:04:14.155]  And there's been fairly strong evidence that the CIA's been involved in drug dealing.
[02:04:14.155 --> 02:04:20.360]  There are times when I think the war in Afghanistan, we say it has to do with pipes and oil, gas pipeline and oil.
[02:04:21.281 --> 02:04:21.862]  I think so.
[02:04:36.664 --> 02:04:51.421]  I don't take the position that I know all those answers, and I don't know everything that the Fed does, but my approach is that we, the people, the people deserve and the Congress has a responsibility to find out what they're doing.
[02:04:52.001 --> 02:04:54.283]  And if they're not doing it, fine and dandy.
[02:04:54.283 --> 02:04:55.104]  We'll clear the air.
[02:04:55.104 --> 02:05:05.353]  But if they are doing it, it will give us more ammunition for the reason why we need a different monetary system and we need to have a different system of collecting intelligence because they can tell us anything.
[02:05:05.353 --> 02:05:07.314]  Remember how we went to war in Iraq?
[02:05:07.314 --> 02:05:09.356]  The CIA was very much involved.
[02:05:09.356 --> 02:05:14.180]  Up there, they say, the CIA, oh, they have weapons of mass destruction.
[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:15.922]  They're about to attack us.
[02:05:15.922 --> 02:05:18.044]  And it was based on false information.
[02:05:18.664 --> 02:05:27.692]  And this is what disturbs me the most, and that's why I want much, much more transparency of what our government is doing.
[02:05:27.692 --> 02:05:31.716]  Well, those were strong statements you made a few months ago, and you just echoed them.
[02:05:31.716 --> 02:05:39.243]  But specifically, Congress, as you know, has had hearings in the 70s about the shadow government, continuity of government.
[02:05:39.243 --> 02:05:44.047]  The Homeland Security Committee in the House has not been allowed to see the full text of PDD 51.
[02:05:45.368 --> 02:05:50.850]  We know we've seen a 12-fold in the last eight-year increase in opium out of Afghanistan.
[02:05:50.850 --> 02:06:01.414]  We know that two years ago, a CIA aircraft that had been used for torture flights crashed in Mexico with pure cocaine, three and a half tons, meaning coming directly from the source, uncut.
[02:06:01.414 --> 02:06:06.976]  I mean, this just comes out in Mena, Arkansas, over and over again.
[02:06:06.976 --> 02:06:10.678]  And so when you talk about a coup over America,
[02:06:11.878 --> 02:06:14.440]  How do we ever ferret this out and remove it?
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:18.963]  I mean, do we start, as you've been calling for, an audit of the private Federal Reserve?
[02:06:18.963 --> 02:06:22.186]  Yeah, it won't happen until the people become really outraged.
[02:06:22.186 --> 02:06:32.774]  They are growing in their outrage, but it has to translate into different ideas and different respect for the Constitution, different people up here, and we're in the midst of this transition.
[02:06:33.494 --> 02:06:43.598]  As the crisis worsens, you know, the real challenge is will we end up with a dictatorship or are we going to have people who are demanding, you know, a republic and open government?
[02:06:43.598 --> 02:06:47.440]  And that might take another 10, 15 years to determine.
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:50.481]  But in the midst of a crisis, it's the worst time to present our views.
[02:06:51.181 --> 02:07:06.047]  That's why we have to do our best to get as many people to agree with us as possible so that in the rebuilding that we have some ideas about what the monetary system should be like and what our foreign policy ought to be like, which means that if we had a proper foreign policy,
[02:07:07.007 --> 02:07:16.757]  The incentive to have this CIA making excuses for knowing everything about us and everything that's going on in the world, that would all change it.
[02:07:16.757 --> 02:07:26.706]  I don't believe that we shouldn't have some intelligence gathering, but I don't like these clandestine operations and killings and things that we've known to have happen.
[02:07:27.486 --> 02:07:56.622]  Well, dovetailing with that, you grilled Bernanke a few days ago, and then the chairman, for those who haven't seen the video, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, Frank, agreed with you and said, we need an investigation of the admitted, and I went and pulled the articles up, because Bernanke was acting like it was preposterous, but it's on record that BCCI and the Federal Reserve, it's on record in 2004 and 5, tens of billions of dollars from the Federal Reserve shipped on pallets into Iraq,
[02:07:57.482 --> 02:08:04.344]  It's on record, Associated Press, that tens of billions of drug money has been found in the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
[02:08:04.344 --> 02:08:07.465]  That was in 2000, that was in the AP.
[02:08:07.465 --> 02:08:10.186]  And then Bernanke just laughs at you and says it doesn't exist.
[02:08:10.186 --> 02:08:24.390]  It's like POTOC from the Southern Poverty Law Center laughing and saying, these Tea Party kooks believe in a world government, when you've got every global leader calling for global government, the IMF calling for a new world order, Herman Van Rompuy, Ban Ki-moon calling for it.
[02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:29.092]  I mean, I think they're really destroying what credibility they had left by stonewalling us.
[02:08:29.092 --> 02:08:40.496]  Can you speak specifically to congressional investigations separate from an audit, just directly on, you know, is the Federal Reserve involved in Greece?
[02:08:40.496 --> 02:08:43.517]  Well, we know they gave the money to Goldman Sachs and we know they are involved.
[02:08:44.637 --> 02:08:54.419]  No, and he used the word bizarre, so he was accusing me of being bizarre, which means anybody who agrees with my concerns are considered bizarre as well.
[02:08:54.419 --> 02:09:01.621]  And you're right in commenting about what Barney Frank said at the end, at the end of my questioning, that we should look into it.
[02:09:01.621 --> 02:09:08.343]  And to his credit, he has sent a letter to the chairman, Bernanke, and Carbon copied me.
[02:09:09.143 --> 02:09:26.100]  And he's insisting that the Federal Reserve respond to my charges, look into it, he asked Bernanke to contact my office to go over the details of the concerns that I've had, and then report back.
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:32.483]  So, Barney Frank did follow up with, interestingly, Barney Frank was involved with Henry Gonzales.
[02:09:32.483 --> 02:09:38.566]  And you know that Henry Gonzales was against the Federal Reserve and demanded these investigations.
[02:09:38.566 --> 02:09:44.228]  And the gentleman that wrote the book from the University of Texas, he worked with Gonzales.
[02:09:44.228 --> 02:09:47.710]  And this is, so he has first-hand information to call this bizarre.
[02:09:47.710 --> 02:09:49.831]  And it's off the wall.
[02:09:49.831 --> 02:09:56.014]  Arbach was in the Federal Reserve and the Congress.
[02:09:56.354 --> 02:10:04.261]  On the Banking Committee for 17 years, and was involved in these investigations, and to just write it off and say, this is, I've never heard it.
[02:10:04.261 --> 02:10:18.014]  So, you know, when he said that, it sort of reminded me about, you know, the debates when the mayor, you know, shouted, and I can't believe this stuff, you know.
[02:10:18.014 --> 02:10:18.775]  What are you saying?
[02:10:19.850 --> 02:10:20.791]  It's incredible.
[02:10:20.791 --> 02:10:22.933]  We've only got four minutes left with Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:10:22.933 --> 02:10:25.556]  We appreciate him joining us live today.
[02:10:25.556 --> 02:10:33.263]  The New York Times is reporting they may try to revive the carbon tax with a direct tax on fuel at the refinery.
[02:10:33.263 --> 02:10:40.049]  Senate Trio hopes to hit paydirt with carbon fee at the oil company's request.
[02:10:40.049 --> 02:10:42.652]  Where is the carbon tax going as well as health care?
[02:10:43.302 --> 02:10:52.146]  Well, it's hard for me to believe they'll do that, even though it's alive and they want to, and that's their goal, and they will if they can.
[02:10:52.146 --> 02:10:58.910]  But under these conditions, it's so bad of an idea, it just blows my mind to think that they'll pursue that.
[02:10:58.910 --> 02:11:07.274]  So I don't know the details on whether that's going to go through or not, but I can guarantee you there's plenty up here who still believe in it and will pursue it.
[02:11:07.274 --> 02:11:11.256]  But I hope they come to their senses and realize how detrimental it would be.
[02:11:11.971 --> 02:11:15.612]  There's a Mary Landrieu quote in here saying, we need to pass this.
[02:11:15.612 --> 02:11:17.933]  This is going to help Americans.
[02:11:17.933 --> 02:11:18.814]  I mean, how bizarre.
[02:11:18.814 --> 02:11:20.994]  More taxes, people are going bankrupt.
[02:11:20.994 --> 02:11:28.377]  In closing, Congressman, we've now discovered that an Obama campaign operative has founded a coffee party.
[02:11:28.377 --> 02:11:34.940]  I actually had this idea with listeners two months ago to get real constitutionalists to take the tea parties back from the neocons.
[02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:47.726]  Now it turns out Obama picked up this idea and that his campaign operatives are now getting all this media attention to tell us to love our federal government, that it's our federal government.
[02:11:47.726 --> 02:11:58.211]  I mean, that shows how powerful the Tea Parties are, if not just the Republican establishment, but now the Democrats are flooding in trying to pose as patriots.
[02:12:00.273 --> 02:12:01.834]  Yeah, they want us to love the government.
[02:12:01.834 --> 02:12:05.697]  How about loving our country and understanding what freedom is all about?
[02:12:05.697 --> 02:12:07.339]  But the battle is out there.
[02:12:07.339 --> 02:12:19.308]  I mean, one thing is they're starting to recognize that the battle may be outside of the conventional wisdom of Republicans and Democrats that run Washington and actually the discussion going on in the independent Tea Party type movement.
[02:12:19.848 --> 02:12:28.370]  And there's no reason to think that everybody is going to believe the right thing and get together and do the right thing in those who are objecting.
[02:12:28.370 --> 02:12:41.733]  But anybody who's involved better realize that if a significant movement erupts like the Tea Party movement, there will be plenty left and right, and everybody else who has a special interest will want to get in and try to control it.
[02:12:42.210 --> 02:12:45.971]  Well, to see the establishment trying to pose as anti-establishment is truly sickening.
[02:12:45.971 --> 02:12:48.272]  But, I mean, look at your 84% approval rating.
[02:12:48.272 --> 02:12:49.732]  People know the real McCoy.
[02:12:49.732 --> 02:12:50.892]  One minute left.
[02:12:50.892 --> 02:12:51.553]  The economy.
[02:12:51.553 --> 02:13:03.496]  A lot of top economists are now agreeing with you and others that we may have a mega-depression in the next 16 months, and they're positioning the IMF and World Bank with a new global constitution where they will pose as saviors again.
[02:13:03.496 --> 02:13:07.857]  How concerned are you that this recession could get a lot worse?
[02:13:08.322 --> 02:13:20.568]  Well, I think it is going to get a lot worse, and what is happening now is Wall Street's recovered and a few companies have recovered, but the unemployment rate is still very high and getting worse.
[02:13:20.568 --> 02:13:31.993]  And there will be plans, I'm sure they've been talking about it for quite a few years, because those who run the international banking system know that they're in trouble, so they are laying plans for this.
[02:13:32.951 --> 02:13:42.018]  People do ask me about, well, do you think this will bring on the North American Union and, you know, North American currency?
[02:13:42.018 --> 02:13:43.279]  And I really don't think so.
[02:13:43.279 --> 02:13:50.525]  I think the bigger concern should be a worldwide currency and the IMF and the United Nations grabbing hold and trying to dictate to us.
[02:13:50.525 --> 02:14:00.212]  But we have economic laws on our side because, you know, you can propose these things and even if it does serve the special interest, if it violates economic law, it won't work.
[02:14:00.212 --> 02:14:02.434]  So they can't maintain a good currency.
[02:14:02.794 --> 02:14:05.875]  And that's why I think the European Union is very, very fragile.
[02:14:05.875 --> 02:14:09.716]  Not only the Euro, but the Union as well, because it's artificial.
[02:14:09.716 --> 02:14:14.578]  And I think that's what would happen on a world government and a world currency.
[02:14:14.578 --> 02:14:24.461]  But in the meantime, it could get pretty messy, and they're going to work very hard to get organized, which means they'll work hard to undermine our personal liberties.
[02:14:25.148 --> 02:14:26.349]  Congressman, we're going to let you go.
[02:14:26.349 --> 02:14:34.052]  In closing, I just want to say, no one in Congress that I've ever studied works as hard as you, does as much media, writes as much legislation.
[02:14:34.052 --> 02:14:35.453]  You are a champion.
[02:14:35.453 --> 02:14:36.153]  God bless you.
[02:14:36.153 --> 02:14:36.734]  Thank you very much.
[02:14:36.734 --> 02:14:37.414]  Got to go.
[02:14:37.414 --> 02:14:37.814]  Take care.
[02:14:37.814 --> 02:14:39.435]  There he goes to run to his vote.
[02:14:39.435 --> 02:14:40.936]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:14:40.936 --> 02:14:45.918]  I mean, that guy is on TV about 10 times a day, does about 10 radio interviews.
[02:14:45.918 --> 02:14:47.559]  I've talked to his press people.
[02:14:47.559 --> 02:14:53.441]  Folks, I do four hours a day and do two or three interviews a day, and I'm constantly turning them down because at 36 years old,
[02:14:56.533 --> 02:14:58.274]  I mean, I'm exhausted.
[02:14:58.274 --> 02:15:05.578]  And that guy's 74 years old and just works so hard.
[02:15:05.578 --> 02:15:14.343]  And I'm just honored that I've been interviewing him since 1996 and that he has never changed, never flip-flopped.
[02:15:14.343 --> 02:15:15.964]  He's absolutely amazing.
[02:15:15.964 --> 02:15:17.285]  Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:15:18.743 --> 02:15:22.566]  Eighty percent of the vote in the Texas primary, unheard of.
[02:15:22.566 --> 02:15:25.227]  Eighty-four percent approval rating in polls.
[02:15:25.227 --> 02:15:26.688]  Ron Paul.
[02:15:26.688 --> 02:15:28.629]  But oh, he's a kook.
[02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:35.114]  He's a, you know, it's outrageous that the Federal Reserve's involved in bailouts or money laundering.
[02:15:35.114 --> 02:15:37.855]  And Bernanke will get up there and say, we've made all the money public.
[02:15:37.855 --> 02:15:39.396]  And then they say, okay, make this public.
[02:15:39.396 --> 02:15:40.677]  Well, we're not going to make that public.
[02:15:40.677 --> 02:15:43.099]  They think viewers on TV are so stupid.
[02:15:43.099 --> 02:15:46.821]  They get up in front of the Congress and lie in front of everyone.
[02:15:46.821 --> 02:15:47.682]  Unbelievable.
[02:15:52.339 --> 02:15:53.220]  You know what I'm going to do?
[02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:56.743]  Go ahead and get Jason Burmas in here.
[02:15:56.743 --> 02:16:15.679]  I'm going to let Jason take my seat right now for this segment and the next segment so he can really cover cyber security for people because I could do it as well but we've been trying for two days to get him in here at one sitting to be able to cover all of this and so what we're going to do is
[02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:19.064]  Yeah, Bermas, go ahead and get your headphones on as you need to jack in right here.
[02:16:19.064 --> 02:16:19.865]  I'm going to let you sit here.
[02:16:19.865 --> 02:16:22.288]  Well, you know, you can sit over there, can't you?
[02:16:22.288 --> 02:16:23.570]  We'll just turn my mic off.
[02:16:23.570 --> 02:16:25.532]  Okay, go ahead and jack in there.
[02:16:25.532 --> 02:16:29.317]  And we're going to have you go over this in this segment and the next segment.
[02:16:29.317 --> 02:16:33.002]  Do it as focused as you can, because you're only going to have about 10 minutes of air time.
[02:16:33.002 --> 02:16:35.304]  And then I'm going to come back, but I'm not going to interrupt you.
[02:16:36.434 --> 02:16:40.580]  And then we're going to open the phones up and get into a ton of other news I haven't even scratched the surface on yet.
[02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:46.529]  But again, no one has read this that I've seen, except Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Curtin MOU, and myself.
[02:16:46.529 --> 02:16:52.498]  We've all written articles, broken it down the last month, but no one else seems to be getting just how evil this is.
[02:16:53.399 --> 02:16:59.563]  Go through it, Jason Bermas, Cybersecurity Act, and then we're going to open the phones up for first-time callers today at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:16:59.563 --> 02:16:59.683]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:16:59.683 --> 02:17:00.324]  Jason Bermas.
[02:17:00.324 --> 02:17:04.867]  Alright, let's just take it from the top on the Cybersecurity Act that did pass the House.
[02:17:04.867 --> 02:17:05.127]  Section 1.
[02:17:05.127 --> 02:17:06.128]  What is this thing?
[02:17:06.128 --> 02:17:07.148]  What is the overview?
[02:17:17.355 --> 02:17:21.956]  Well, first of all, they're going to create a cybersecurity advisory panel.
[02:17:21.956 --> 02:17:32.939]  So, the Office of Cybersecurity is already going to be a new bureaucracy, and then they will pick bureaucrats that are allegianced to globalist world dictatorships as their board.
[02:17:32.939 --> 02:17:36.020]  Real-time cybersecurity dashboard.
[02:17:37.202 --> 02:17:45.225]  Now, what that means is they will have a grid for all CCTV cameras, whether they be in the private sector or the government sector.
[02:17:45.225 --> 02:18:00.010]  So it won't just be the CCTV cameras that are outside of the Federal Reserve Building in D.C., which is not a government organization, or the ones outside of the halls of Congress, or the White House, or the ones that are supposedly protecting us in the subways of New York City.
[02:18:00.010 --> 02:18:04.192]  We're talking about a system that can tap into, in real time,
[02:18:05.032 --> 02:18:10.614]  In real time, all CCTV cameras across the country.
[02:18:10.614 --> 02:18:14.295]  State and regional cybersecurity enhancement program.
[02:18:14.295 --> 02:18:23.278]  This again is to ensure that the local officials such as your sheriff, your state senator, your congressional representative are under their thumb.
[02:18:24.517 --> 02:18:27.579]  And remember, they're going after all infrastructure.
[02:18:27.579 --> 02:18:36.205]  They say all the important infrastructure, and then they reveal themselves in the bill that they will be giving grants to businesses of a hundred people or less.
[02:18:36.205 --> 02:18:37.986]  That's everybody.
[02:18:37.986 --> 02:18:39.647]  All infrastructures.
[02:18:39.647 --> 02:18:43.190]  NIST Standards of Development and Compliance.
[02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:51.616]  You will comply with the criminal organization that the National Institute of Standards and Technologies has proven itself to be.
[02:18:52.651 --> 02:19:02.013]  Again, NIST is behind the cover up of what happened at World Trade Center 1, 2, and 7, 8 plus years later.
[02:19:02.013 --> 02:19:06.134]  Yeah, let's give more power to NIST.
[02:19:06.134 --> 02:19:09.315]  Secure Domain Name Addressing System.
[02:19:09.315 --> 02:19:16.097]  This is to ensure that all the major universities and all the major corporations are giving out domain names.
[02:19:16.097 --> 02:19:21.298]  But it gets worse than that because when you put the FCC in control of the internet,
[02:19:22.386 --> 02:19:28.730]  And you create a mandatory licensing system, they get to say, you know what, we don't like InfoWars.com.
[02:19:28.730 --> 02:19:36.455]  We don't think Alex Jones and PrisonPlanet.tv should be broadcast across the country, across the world.
[02:19:36.455 --> 02:19:40.178]  We don't like that they're reading actual bills to the people.
[02:19:41.584 --> 02:19:43.485]  So you can read this bill.
[02:19:43.485 --> 02:19:44.125]  It's out there.
[02:19:44.125 --> 02:19:44.986]  We're going to come back.
[02:19:44.986 --> 02:19:46.787]  We're going to go through even more of it.
[02:19:46.787 --> 02:19:47.847]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:47.847 --> 02:19:48.988]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[02:19:48.988 --> 02:19:53.470]  Go check us out over at Infowars.com and get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[02:19:53.470 --> 02:19:54.151]  $5.95 a month.
[02:19:54.151 --> 02:19:54.651]  Are you kidding me?
[02:20:01.793 --> 02:20:04.215]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[02:20:04.215 --> 02:20:08.058]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.
[02:20:08.058 --> 02:20:11.661]  Keep listening for a special offer from PowerVapor.com.
[02:20:11.661 --> 02:20:15.664]  Standard tobacco cigarettes contain over 4,000 harmful chemicals.
[02:20:15.664 --> 02:20:20.708]  Now it's time to release yourself from the grip of big tobacco and experience true smoking.
[02:20:20.728 --> 02:20:21.749]  Smoking freedom.
[02:20:21.749 --> 02:20:30.936]  PowerVapor.com is an e-cigarette with the look, feel, and smoke of a real cigarette, but with no tar, no carbon monoxide, and no bad odors.
[02:20:30.936 --> 02:20:37.862]  Power Vapor's e-cigarettes deliver just the right amount of nicotine in a water vapor that looks and feels like real smoke.
[02:20:37.862 --> 02:20:42.506]  Yes, you choose from four levels of nicotine, and that puts you back in control.
[02:20:42.506 --> 02:20:46.249]  Plus, you'll enjoy eight flavors and big savings over traditional cigarettes.

[02:20:59.184 --> 02:21:01.387]  The smoking gun heard round the world.
[02:21:02.037 --> 02:21:04.419]  Good day, Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources.
[02:21:04.419 --> 02:21:06.880]  Today is Thursday, March 4th, 2010.
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:07.881]  Gold opened this morning at $11.4020.
[02:21:07.881 --> 02:21:11.663]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.7116, $5.8558 for a half ounce, and $2.9279 for a quarter ounce.
[02:21:11.663 --> 02:21:11.883]  $11.7116, $5.8558, and $2.9279.
[02:21:21.969 --> 02:21:32.439]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[02:21:32.439 --> 02:21:35.642]  With a stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[02:21:35.642 --> 02:21:39.025]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[02:21:39.025 --> 02:21:41.768]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[02:21:41.988 --> 02:21:44.729]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[02:21:44.729 --> 02:21:47.691]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:47.691 --> 02:21:49.992]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[02:21:49.992 --> 02:21:52.873]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:52.873 --> 02:21:56.575]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:56.575 --> 02:21:56.755]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:03.442 --> 02:22:07.471]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:22:07.471 --> 02:22:10.718]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:22:10.718 --> 02:22:12.140]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:22:12.839 --> 02:22:15.920]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:21.901]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:21.901 --> 02:22:27.443]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:22:27.443 --> 02:22:37.085]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:22:37.205 --> 02:22:39.546]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:39.546 --> 02:22:41.126]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:41.126 --> 02:22:43.587]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:22:43.587 --> 02:22:45.727]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:45.727 --> 02:22:50.868]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:22:50.868 --> 02:22:55.870]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:22:55.870 --> 02:22:59.971]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:23:03.246 --> 02:23:06.611]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:23:06.611 --> 02:23:14.804]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[02:23:14.804 --> 02:23:17.548]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most
[02:23:19.352 --> 02:23:20.553]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:23:20.553 --> 02:23:24.917]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:23:24.917 --> 02:23:31.342]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[02:23:43.212 --> 02:23:46.855]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[02:23:46.855 --> 02:23:49.496]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:49.496 --> 02:23:54.940]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:54.940 --> 02:23:56.281]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:24:17.839 --> 02:24:18.519]  We are back.
[02:24:18.519 --> 02:24:19.520]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:21.861]  I am Jason Burma, sitting in for just this segment.
[02:24:21.861 --> 02:24:24.743]  Alex, to join us in just a moment.
[02:24:24.743 --> 02:24:29.185]  Now, I was talking earlier about the Cybersecurity Advisory Panel.
[02:24:29.185 --> 02:24:30.746]  What will this be constructed of?
[02:24:30.746 --> 02:24:33.568]  Who will be advising cybersecurity?
[02:24:33.568 --> 02:24:36.669]  They shall appoint, as members, again, not elected.
[02:24:36.669 --> 02:24:43.193]  We're not electing who's going to be in charge of the Internet, the last bastion of freedom in this country and the world.
[02:24:43.193 --> 02:24:46.195]  They'll be appointed, because that's how we roll in America now.
[02:24:47.304 --> 02:24:50.506]  Shall appoint as members of panel representatives of industry.
[02:24:50.506 --> 02:24:53.007]  Oh, maybe Mr. Rockefeller will sit on the board.
[02:24:53.007 --> 02:24:54.288]  David!
[02:24:54.288 --> 02:24:56.489]  Academic, non-profit organizations.
[02:24:56.489 --> 02:25:01.992]  Again, they prop up these non-profit organizations with all this funding.
[02:25:01.992 --> 02:25:06.735]  Then they're able, again, if they get caught doing something bad, they just blame that one organization.
[02:25:06.735 --> 02:25:08.016]  It's all compartmentalized.
[02:25:09.364 --> 02:25:13.105]  Interest groups and advocacy organizations.
[02:25:13.105 --> 02:25:20.907]  They're literally telling you that the special interest groups, the industrialists, the globalists will run the cyber security panel.
[02:25:20.907 --> 02:25:23.128]  They will be appointed.
[02:25:23.128 --> 02:25:25.389]  No due process whatsoever for these people.
[02:25:25.389 --> 02:25:26.449]  They haven't robbed you enough.
[02:25:27.754 --> 02:25:28.834]  Uh, let's see.
[02:25:28.834 --> 02:25:31.535]  This is at the state and local level as well.
[02:25:31.535 --> 02:25:42.217]  As governments who qualify will provide advice and information on cybersecurity research, development, demonstrations, education, technology transfer, commercial application, or societal and civil liberty concerns.
[02:25:42.217 --> 02:25:47.079]  Again, no concerns about the Constitution and Bill of Rights and whether this is legal or not.
[02:25:47.079 --> 02:25:52.800]  They're just going to prop up their little snitches in the mayor's office, in the sheriff's department.
[02:25:53.857 --> 02:26:02.883]  In the state troopers' barracks to rat anybody out who dare question our industrialist leaders on this panel.
[02:26:02.883 --> 02:26:05.705]  This bill is nightmarish.
[02:26:05.705 --> 02:26:07.247]  What are the duties of this panel?
[02:26:07.247 --> 02:26:14.011]  The panel shall advise the President on matters relating to the National Cybersecurity Program and Strategy.
[02:26:14.011 --> 02:26:17.254]  Again, trends and developments in cybersecurity science and research.
[02:26:18.390 --> 02:26:21.973]  Progress made in implementing this strategy.
[02:26:21.973 --> 02:26:23.654]  How do we get the grid in place?
[02:26:23.654 --> 02:26:25.496]  And they tell you how they're going to get the grid in place.
[02:26:25.496 --> 02:26:30.019]  They're going to recruit your children through scholarships.
[02:26:30.019 --> 02:26:37.445]  And for these scholarships, they will have to do summer internship programs for the federal government.
[02:26:37.445 --> 02:26:42.930]  And they later state that all software, all software will have to be approved by NIST.
[02:26:42.930 --> 02:26:47.133]  If you want to be an IT person, you will have to be certified by the federal government.
[02:26:47.133 --> 02:26:47.734]  Folks, I work
[02:26:48.766 --> 02:26:51.107]  IT on the side every once in a while?
[02:26:51.107 --> 02:26:55.128]  I can assure you I am not endorsed by the federal government.
[02:26:55.128 --> 02:26:57.229]  I can still take apart a computer.
[02:26:57.229 --> 02:26:57.449]  Okay?
[02:26:57.449 --> 02:26:58.689]  I can still fix one.
[02:26:58.689 --> 02:27:00.030]  I can put in a hard drive.
[02:27:00.030 --> 02:27:01.010]  I can fix a motherboard.
[02:27:01.010 --> 02:27:02.971]  I can put some RAM in.
[02:27:02.971 --> 02:27:03.831]  Is that bad?
[02:27:03.831 --> 02:27:07.532]  Will I not be allowed to do this unless the federal government deems it so?
[02:27:07.532 --> 02:27:10.713]  They'll be like, he's a fake contractor.
[02:27:10.713 --> 02:27:12.314]  He's not federally certified.
[02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:22.035]  And there'll be plenty of people who are certified, again, because they are recruiting the youngest, the most impressionable, the brightest minds out there.
[02:27:22.035 --> 02:27:23.036]  K-12.
[02:27:23.036 --> 02:27:27.839]  Alex has talked about in the past, you know, college and high school level students.
[02:27:27.839 --> 02:27:29.019]  No.
[02:27:29.019 --> 02:27:31.241]  We're talking about your fourth grader, your fifth grader.
[02:27:31.241 --> 02:27:36.124]  When I was in school, I basically worked on a glorified word processing machine.
[02:27:36.124 --> 02:27:37.885]  We played Oregon Trail.
[02:27:37.885 --> 02:27:41.427]  These kids are way beyond word processing.
[02:27:41.427 --> 02:27:42.928]  They're going to be into data sheets.
[02:27:44.093 --> 02:27:52.155]  And patterns, and trends, and how to surveil people via CCTV inside their homes.
[02:27:52.155 --> 02:27:53.296]  That's going to come to America.
[02:27:53.296 --> 02:27:55.456]  It's already in the United Kingdom.
[02:27:55.456 --> 02:28:05.599]  Do you understand that Sinbin families, the supposed worst of the worst, folks, it's almost laughable, have to have CCTV cameras in their homes.
[02:28:05.599 --> 02:28:07.680]  And that was reported over a year ago.
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:11.941]  They were already in 2,000 homes in the United Kingdom.
[02:28:13.251 --> 02:28:15.053]  Set to go to 20,000.
[02:28:15.053 --> 02:28:20.417]  Also covered in my upcoming film, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[02:28:20.417 --> 02:28:21.618]  Because this is a global plan.
[02:28:21.618 --> 02:28:24.000]  This is about international regulation as well.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:30.345]  And when we have international regulation of the internet in places like China, guess what gets censored?
[02:28:30.345 --> 02:28:32.507]  YouTube!
[02:28:32.507 --> 02:28:35.509]  Can you imagine a free internet without YouTube?
[02:28:35.509 --> 02:28:37.430]  Pretty hard to do, huh?
[02:28:37.430 --> 02:28:37.911]  I'd say about
[02:28:39.621 --> 02:28:47.427]  75-80% of the original information and content news is on YouTube.
[02:28:47.427 --> 02:28:49.008]  So let's censor that.
[02:28:49.008 --> 02:28:50.969]  Let's be China.
[02:28:50.969 --> 02:28:52.310]  Let's have slave communities.
[02:28:52.310 --> 02:28:55.052]  Let's be guilty until proven innocent.
[02:28:55.052 --> 02:28:56.613]  Let's have military on the streets.
[02:28:56.613 --> 02:28:58.494]  Let's have one-child policies.
[02:28:58.494 --> 02:29:03.397]  And these are the UN policies!
[02:29:03.397 --> 02:29:04.478]  Let's just keep going over the bill.
[02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:14.605]  They will be making loans on a selective short-term basis of items advanced in cybersecurity measures to small businesses with less than 100 employees.
[02:29:14.605 --> 02:29:18.207]  And this is that private sector control I'm talking about.
[02:29:18.207 --> 02:29:25.572]  They're already going to go after all the big corporations, the big facilities, and the largest of the large will sit on the board of the cybersecurity panel.
[02:29:26.312 --> 02:29:27.532]  As appointed gods.
[02:29:27.532 --> 02:29:31.413]  We're going to come back, do one more segment on the cyber security bill.
[02:29:31.413 --> 02:29:33.793]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in for Alex Jones, just this segment.
[02:29:33.793 --> 02:29:34.854]  He'll be back after this.
[02:29:34.854 --> 02:29:51.856]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:29:51.856 --> 02:29:53.257]  We're on the march.

[02:32:01.005 --> 02:32:03.767]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[02:32:03.767 --> 02:32:09.790]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:09.790 --> 02:32:17.635]  Anyone placing food orders on the large-volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[02:32:18.055 --> 02:32:24.420]  For example, with each pre-production order of three 7-Day Responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[02:32:24.420 --> 02:32:26.581]  That's Buy 3, Get 1 Free.
[02:32:26.581 --> 02:32:29.483]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[02:32:29.483 --> 02:32:37.049]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this Buy 3, Get 1 Free program.
[02:32:37.449 --> 02:32:40.711]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[02:32:40.711 --> 02:32:41.792]  Another example?
[02:32:41.792 --> 02:32:44.974]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[02:32:44.974 --> 02:32:50.457]  You've got to go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[02:32:50.457 --> 02:32:50.937]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[02:32:50.937 --> 02:32:51.978]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[02:33:08.962 --> 02:33:18.436]  Alright, Jason, I'm going to go to calls and a bunch of other news here in a moment, but now, just without breaking it down too much, go through some of the other subsections in the bill.
[02:33:20.831 --> 02:33:34.279]  Software standardization right here because again all software will have to go through the cyber security panel that again is industrialists, globalists, nobody who's actually elected, all appointed.
[02:33:34.279 --> 02:33:39.662]  That's like the SPP, North American Union, private corporations and secret meetings set it all up.
[02:33:39.662 --> 02:33:39.942]  Absolutely.
[02:33:39.942 --> 02:33:41.623]  This is a corporate global government.
[02:33:41.623 --> 02:33:46.146]  Now they're openly saying a bank of the world constitution running the whole planet with carbon taxes.
[02:33:46.266 --> 02:33:48.609]  And for those that don't believe me, let me just read that subsection again.
[02:34:01.223 --> 02:34:08.266]  The biggest subsection in there is where they go down to IT companies that have a hundred or more customers and they have to put their software in and be run by the federal government.
[02:34:08.266 --> 02:34:09.846]  I mean this is just totally taking over everything.
[02:34:09.846 --> 02:34:10.527]  Absolutely and then again
[02:34:29.034 --> 02:34:40.204]  When the FCC takes over with their national broadband plan right here in section 6, subsection 2, we'll all need mandatory licensing beginning in the next three years to be on the internet.
[02:34:40.204 --> 02:34:43.607]  I wonder if they're going to allow InfoWars.com and PrisonPlan.tv?
[02:34:43.607 --> 02:34:48.511]  Well, that's what the New York Times and the White House and all of them have called for is internet licensing to even get online.
[02:34:48.511 --> 02:34:49.772]  Absolutely.
[02:34:49.772 --> 02:34:52.415]  As they train your children, as they go through,
[02:34:53.562 --> 02:34:58.868]  And K-12 students for participation in summer work and internship programs.
[02:34:58.868 --> 02:35:03.533]  Why would a kindergartner be in a summer program with the federal government?
[02:35:03.533 --> 02:35:04.834]  It's absolutely obscene.
[02:35:04.834 --> 02:35:07.136]  It's absolutely absurd.
[02:35:07.136 --> 02:35:08.538]  But they want the best in price.
[02:35:08.538 --> 02:35:10.960]  They want to control it top to bottom.
[02:35:11.843 --> 02:35:24.700]  The top, of course, being the appointed members of industry, of the banks, of the special interest groups, and then at the very bottom, the slave class children that will be trained to run this grid.
[02:35:24.700 --> 02:35:29.626]  And let's not forget, these aren't just... Now, they're shifting the economy over where there's billions of dollars of funding a year.
[02:35:31.195 --> 02:35:36.039]  Literally designing and engineering our economy, where that's the jobs people can get.
[02:35:36.039 --> 02:35:37.360]  That's the scholarships they can get.
[02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:48.490]  And you predicted this back in 2003 or 2002, I can't remember the video, but if you can find the Alex Jones SeaWorld video, he literally goes into the back room and starts typing on the computers and telling people, that's how it's going to be.
[02:35:48.490 --> 02:35:52.294]  You're going to be trained to sit at your desk and watch a computer and tattletale on people.
[02:35:52.294 --> 02:35:53.134]  Well, no, they said that.
[02:35:53.134 --> 02:35:54.195]  That's why I knew.
[02:35:54.195 --> 02:35:55.036]  Yeah.
[02:35:55.036 --> 02:35:57.278]  They said the jobs will be watching each other.
[02:35:57.518 --> 02:35:57.918]  Mm-hmm.
[02:35:57.918 --> 02:35:59.980]  And that's what this bill is about.
[02:35:59.980 --> 02:36:02.041]  And it's not just about the United States.
[02:36:02.041 --> 02:36:03.202]  International standards.
[02:36:03.202 --> 02:36:04.683]  And we know how the Internet is run.
[02:36:04.683 --> 02:36:11.207]  Well, last year they had control of the Internet domain system and address system to the UN.
[02:36:11.207 --> 02:36:11.687]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:36:11.687 --> 02:36:13.008]  I forget what the organization is.
[02:36:13.008 --> 02:36:13.508]  ICANN.
[02:36:13.508 --> 02:36:14.309]  That's right, ICANN.
[02:36:14.309 --> 02:36:22.454]  And they threw a big fit about that, but then national media says, don't worry, just drink your mercury-laced water.
[02:36:22.454 --> 02:36:23.315]  Alright, hit the last points.
[02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:28.503]  Again, the government is taking over the entire internet.
[02:36:28.503 --> 02:36:31.506]  They're putting it under FCC and NIST control.
[02:36:31.506 --> 02:36:35.910]  NIST will tell you how the software can be configured.
[02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:37.792]  They will tell you what you can run on your computers.
[02:36:37.792 --> 02:36:39.573]  This is for private sector.
[02:36:39.573 --> 02:36:45.619]  Private sector, public sector in the smallest regions, in the smallest of towns.
[02:36:45.619 --> 02:36:47.040]  They're going after you.
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:49.222]  It says so in this bill.
[02:36:50.023 --> 02:36:50.824]  Think about that.
[02:36:50.824 --> 02:36:53.046]  Why would they need regional cyber security?
[02:36:53.046 --> 02:36:57.151]  Why would they need to go after organizations with less than 100 employees?
[02:36:57.151 --> 02:37:00.535]  Why is the critical infrastructure also privatized?
[02:37:00.535 --> 02:37:02.637]  Why is the FCC stepping in?
[02:37:02.637 --> 02:37:09.885]  Again, the internet is the last bastion of freedom, and the FCC has ruined television, they've ruined regular radio, and they will ruin the internet.
[02:37:09.885 --> 02:37:10.586]  This is it, Alex.
[02:37:12.853 --> 02:37:17.054]  I pray to God that this bill, A, doesn't get worse in the Senate, and B, pass the Senate.
[02:37:17.054 --> 02:37:18.594]  People need to wake up.
[02:37:18.594 --> 02:37:25.216]  Because my liberal friends sit there and they ninny and say, oh, we need cyber security, and it's all in the program.
[02:37:25.216 --> 02:37:38.238]  And we have Michael Chertoff and others on CNN with this big cyber security act where they literally say, at one point, the National Guard is coming in for martial law, and if the governors don't like that it's under federal control, too bad.
[02:37:38.238 --> 02:37:39.359]  And then they laughed about it.
[02:37:39.359 --> 02:37:40.099]  They're like, too bad!
[02:37:41.079 --> 02:37:49.905]  Literally talking about... Well, that's because the banks are coming in with their swindle takeover and they've got to suppress free speech so they can get away with all the crimes they're committing.
[02:37:49.905 --> 02:38:03.835]  It's like the ATF shutting down gun shows without a law, raiding toy stores and taking their toy, not even real BB guns, and having no law and saying we don't care, spying on us without warrants.
[02:38:03.835 --> 02:38:04.696]  I mean, this is happening.
[02:38:04.696 --> 02:38:06.237]  Burmas, I'm going to move on to calls.
[02:38:06.237 --> 02:38:07.758]  Go ahead and finish some of the last subsections.
[02:38:09.309 --> 02:38:10.494]  Let's see.
[02:38:10.494 --> 02:38:13.084]  I just really want to hit on this one subsection again.
[02:38:13.965 --> 02:38:14.365]  Section 12.
[02:38:14.365 --> 02:38:16.826]  There's a bunch of other subsections.
[02:38:16.826 --> 02:38:20.948]  I just want to go over this cyber scholarship program because it's so important, Alex.
[02:38:20.948 --> 02:38:25.529]  The director of the National Science Foundation shall establish a federal cyber scholarship for service program.
[02:38:25.529 --> 02:38:26.970]  And it's going to sound real nice.
[02:38:26.970 --> 02:38:31.572]  Your kid is going to come home with that letter and they're saying, he's a junior computer genius.
[02:38:31.572 --> 02:38:33.792]  We want to have him for our summer program.
[02:38:33.792 --> 02:38:35.253]  We want to even give you money.
[02:38:35.253 --> 02:38:38.434]  And then they indoctrinate your child to spy on you.
[02:38:38.434 --> 02:38:40.515]  This is Homeland Security CIA.
[02:38:40.515 --> 02:38:42.095]  Go to the next one.
[02:38:42.095 --> 02:38:43.156]  Let's see what we got here.
[02:38:45.206 --> 02:38:49.008]  Because I read it about a month ago on air and there's a lot of other key subsections there at the end.
[02:38:49.008 --> 02:38:51.189]  They talk about giving prizes!
[02:38:51.189 --> 02:38:51.489]  Prizes!
[02:38:51.489 --> 02:38:55.291]  Remember the cash prizes for CCTV cameras in the United Kingdom?
[02:38:55.291 --> 02:38:58.953]  How they're going to spy on criminals and people are going to watch random CCTV cameras.
[02:38:58.953 --> 02:38:59.753]  It's right here.
[02:38:59.753 --> 02:39:05.476]  Prizes under this section may consist of federal appropriated funds and funds by the private sector for such cash prizes.
[02:39:05.476 --> 02:39:06.757]  So they're making it a reward system.
[02:39:06.757 --> 02:39:12.019]  Well that's like the IRS now paying people to spy on their neighbors and inside businesses and just make stuff up.
[02:39:12.019 --> 02:39:13.600]  We're turning into the total snitch society.
[02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:16.421]  Absolutely, and there's a bunch of collusion in here.
[02:39:16.421 --> 02:39:20.022]  Basically, administering the competition regulates the competition.
[02:39:20.022 --> 02:39:24.463]  It will be even worse than the two giants, Microsoft and Macintosh.
[02:39:24.463 --> 02:39:28.304]  No one will be able to get into the game of writing software, Alex.
[02:39:28.304 --> 02:39:30.005]  There will be no other operating systems.
[02:39:30.205 --> 02:39:33.848]  And all the operating systems will be approved by the federal government.
[02:39:33.848 --> 02:39:46.078]  We already know there are so many backdoors in Windows Vista, the new Windows 7, we know Google is working with the NSA, obviously Apple is a front for intelligence with their iPhone.
[02:39:46.078 --> 02:39:46.619]  The iPhone...
[02:39:47.299 --> 02:39:50.180]  It was revealed, I believe, six months ago, Alex.
[02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:57.042]  Every time one of those boxes collapses, it takes a picture with your camera and stores it in a temporary folder that then can be accessed.
[02:39:57.042 --> 02:40:12.327]  And this is really all just an extension of what we saw in the 90s with Echelon and Carnivore and these other type of track, trace, and database programs that would look for keywords and then basically database you.
[02:40:12.327 --> 02:40:13.388]  Put you into a system.
[02:40:14.412 --> 02:40:15.933]  Try to profile you.
[02:40:15.933 --> 02:40:17.033]  And this is the next extension.
[02:40:17.033 --> 02:40:18.434]  A lot of people don't understand.
[02:40:18.434 --> 02:40:30.359]  Under the Bush administration, outside of the warrantless wiretaps, we had them admitting that they were tracking, tracing, and databasing everything we do on a computer from IMs to emails to talking on our cell phones.
[02:40:30.359 --> 02:40:30.940]  Absolutely.
[02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:32.080]  Burmese, thanks for coming in with that.
[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:34.941]  There's even a lot more in there and Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson have written articles about it.
[02:40:34.941 --> 02:40:35.362]  Thank you.
[02:40:35.362 --> 02:40:35.722]  Thank you.
[02:40:35.722 --> 02:40:37.703]  Appreciate you spending time with us.
[02:40:37.703 --> 02:40:39.424]  Okay, here's what I want to do.
[02:40:39.424 --> 02:40:39.964]  I want to go to
[02:40:41.263 --> 02:40:47.988]  Rikita, Dalton, Kelly, Tom, Ben, and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:40:47.988 --> 02:40:49.949]  We're taking first-time calls a day.
[02:40:49.949 --> 02:40:53.812]  I do that every few weeks so people that can never get in have a chance to be heard on air.
[02:40:53.812 --> 02:40:54.372]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:40:54.372 --> 02:40:56.974]  And then I want to get into several key stacks of news.
[02:41:04.923 --> 02:41:13.066]  That I have here in front of me that I haven't even gotten into yet, and I want to plow back through an article that I started talking about, but it's so important I'm going to get back into it.
[02:41:13.066 --> 02:41:16.927]  Coffee Party founder is Obama campaign operative.
[02:41:16.927 --> 02:41:34.553]  See, two months ago we had the idea to start a coffee party to wake up the Tea Party that they're being taken over by mainline Republicans who don't want to audit the Federal Reserve, that don't want to repeal unconstitutional gun laws, that are pro-Patriot Act and police state.
[02:41:37.113 --> 02:41:39.494]  But they're posing as patriots, so it'd be the coffee party.
[02:41:39.494 --> 02:41:43.016]  Well, Obama has now created one to be pro-government.
[02:41:43.016 --> 02:41:45.117]  Pro-corrupt government.
[02:41:45.117 --> 02:41:52.001]  And this is another one of his initiatives to try to get all these fake community organizations out there working for him and spying on American citizens.
[02:41:52.001 --> 02:41:57.804]  Remember when they said, report fishy neighbors, or people that criticize the government, to the White House.
[02:41:57.804 --> 02:41:59.705]  So, that is coming up as well.
[02:41:59.705 --> 02:42:04.108]  But right now, I want to go ahead and go to some of your phone calls.
[02:42:04.108 --> 02:42:06.549]  Rakita in Maryland, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:42:07.725 --> 02:42:08.806]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[02:42:08.806 --> 02:42:11.709]  I'm well.
[02:42:11.709 --> 02:42:23.841]  Okay, I was just listening to your segment and I was curious to know if you knew if the Nielsen Company had any ties to the government.
[02:42:23.841 --> 02:42:30.607]  Well, I mean, Nielsen gets you to put a tracker box on your cable box or television that tracks what you watch.
[02:42:31.519 --> 02:42:37.180]  But any digital cable boxer, TiVo, tracks what you watch and what you do and it's two-way.
[02:42:37.180 --> 02:42:39.441]  Just like a computer, it is a computer.
[02:42:39.441 --> 02:42:41.101]  That's admitted.
[02:42:41.101 --> 02:42:47.083]  But I don't particularly know about Nielsen.
[02:42:47.083 --> 02:42:55.465]  I was curious because I'm currently in Nielsen House and probably about a week and a half ago,
[02:42:56.297 --> 02:42:56.597]  I don't know.
[02:43:12.492 --> 02:43:14.453]  Yeah, well, that's already going on.
[02:43:14.453 --> 02:43:16.493]  They just want you to openly go along with them.
[02:43:16.493 --> 02:43:22.535]  Google all the major systems, Time Warner, Spy, record everything, sell it to the government.
[02:43:22.535 --> 02:43:24.496]  That's on record.
[02:43:24.496 --> 02:43:32.059]  So they're just wanting you to pay you so that they can publicly use the data.
[02:43:32.059 --> 02:43:34.780]  But this is already going on with your computer.
[02:43:34.780 --> 02:43:36.300]  It's already going on with digital cable box.
[02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:39.141]  It's already going on with all cell phones under federal law.
[02:43:39.141 --> 02:43:41.242]  Everything is a tracking grid.
[02:43:44.386 --> 02:43:53.111]  Oh wow, so even if I didn't agree to it, there's someone tracking the pages I'm going to anyway.
[02:43:53.111 --> 02:43:54.832]  Yes, I appreciate your call.
[02:43:54.832 --> 02:44:08.539]  Now about 10 years ago, separate companies from Arbitron that tracks radio, similar to Nielsen, a AM or FM receiver in a car or in your home or on a boat or wherever it is,
[02:44:09.909 --> 02:44:14.070]  Doesn't just receive, it transmits at a much lower level.
[02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:17.932]  Part of the receiving is a micro-transmitting.
[02:44:17.932 --> 02:44:27.254]  And so they started putting in billboards all over the country that would, as cars drove by, be able to scan what frequency they were listening to.
[02:44:27.254 --> 02:44:38.198]  And if you've noticed with digital frequencies now in your car, it'll tell you what station you're listening to, even what song's on, because out over the carrier of the AM or FM,
[02:44:39.639 --> 02:44:50.529]  They're also sending out a data information stream that tells your AM FM radio in your car, even the cheapest ones, exactly what you're doing.
[02:44:50.529 --> 02:44:56.314]  They're also moving towards people meters like a Nielsen box in the cars and that's being phased in.
[02:44:56.314 --> 02:44:57.435]  It's already in most the country.
[02:44:58.617 --> 02:45:02.638]  But this is just where they admit they're doing this and where you opt in.
[02:45:02.638 --> 02:45:08.460]  Google, four years ago, said they're using cameras and microphones on over 150 million computers in the U.S.
[02:45:08.460 --> 02:45:10.881]  to listen to everything you're doing in your house.
[02:45:10.881 --> 02:45:15.003]  And people thought when I was reading their own press release I was making that up.
[02:45:15.003 --> 02:45:22.905]  I had people at the local radio station where I was doing the Sunday show out of, at the time, would make jokes when I walked down the hall.
[02:45:22.905 --> 02:45:26.126]  Oh, they're watching me on the camera on my computer.
[02:45:26.126 --> 02:45:27.467]  You know, that's up at the top of the screen.
[02:45:29.014 --> 02:45:30.475]  Oh, they're listening to me, Alex.
[02:45:30.475 --> 02:45:32.596]  Are they going to get me?
[02:45:32.596 --> 02:45:39.459]  I'd tell people 14 years ago that digital cable boxes were tracking everything you did, because I had the manuals that were sent to me.
[02:45:39.459 --> 02:45:43.321]  In one case of the Atlantic Scientific or Scientific Atlantic box.
[02:45:43.321 --> 02:45:44.922]  Now it's all admitted.
[02:45:44.922 --> 02:45:49.244]  And now, oh, the schools are watching the children when they go home with their government-issued laptops.
[02:45:50.245 --> 02:45:55.349]  So this is a total control grid and it's the same thing with all the new cell phones.
[02:45:55.349 --> 02:45:57.791]  So people are like, well then why do you have a free iPhone app?
[02:45:57.791 --> 02:45:59.032]  Why do you have a cell phone?
[02:45:59.032 --> 02:46:02.595]  Well, I mean, we're using the matrix to get people out of the matrix.
[02:46:02.595 --> 02:46:09.982]  I mean, it'd be stupid if I just said I was going to be Amish and move out in the middle of nowhere and just scream from the top of a mountain.
[02:46:09.982 --> 02:46:12.564]  I'm in the grid telling you about the grid.
[02:46:14.542 --> 02:46:16.743]  But let's continue with phone calls.
[02:46:16.743 --> 02:46:17.884]  That was a really good question.
[02:46:17.884 --> 02:46:19.025]  Dalton in Detroit.
[02:46:19.025 --> 02:46:20.906]  You're on the air, Dalton.
[02:46:20.906 --> 02:46:21.687]  Hey Alex.
[02:46:21.687 --> 02:46:25.489]  I want to thank you for helping this country and changing my life.
[02:46:25.489 --> 02:46:27.450]  One quick statement.
[02:46:27.450 --> 02:46:28.031]  One quick statement.
[02:46:28.031 --> 02:46:36.496]  I think that the IRS plane crash with Mr. Stack was not an inside job because I think if it was, the government would be still playing it up every single day.
[02:46:36.496 --> 02:46:39.358]  Well, they have been playing it up on quite a few channels, but go ahead.
[02:46:40.394 --> 02:46:51.019]  Second thing, how much validity do you lay in the heist with your own dreams fan, Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, over at Fort Knox?
[02:46:51.019 --> 02:46:54.801]  You know, there's always stories, Dalton, that can't be confirmed.
[02:46:54.801 --> 02:46:56.822]  That, oh, Karl Rove was arrested in Europe.
[02:46:56.822 --> 02:46:57.743]  Not true.
[02:46:57.743 --> 02:47:03.226]  Then you learn the sources of media that always put out this info after a few times doing it.
[02:47:03.226 --> 02:47:06.627]  It's kind of like the hoax of the Amaro coin that was just a
[02:47:08.402 --> 02:47:14.627]  Memorabilia made as a joke by a small coin manufacturer, and we said day one, here's who makes it, it's not real.
[02:47:14.627 --> 02:47:21.032]  People still don't know the truth, even though we've told them a hundred times, probably more than a hundred times.
[02:47:21.032 --> 02:47:24.976]  As for the IMF and World Bank and the Federal Reserve selling
[02:47:26.454 --> 02:47:30.415]  Gold-plated tungsten that has a similar weight to gold.
[02:47:30.415 --> 02:47:32.336]  I have seen no evidence of that.
[02:47:32.336 --> 02:47:39.898]  I mean, it doesn't mean it's not true, but you would have heard countries and governments and corporations buying this gold, screaming, bloody murder.
[02:47:39.898 --> 02:47:40.878]  I appreciate your call.
[02:47:40.878 --> 02:47:45.099]  Kelly in Indiana, you're on the air.
[02:47:45.099 --> 02:47:47.620]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:48.900]  Two things.
[02:47:48.900 --> 02:47:52.841]  I love your delivery, I love the way you give the news, and I love how you're passionate about what you do.
[02:47:55.845 --> 02:48:07.703]  I'd also just like to say that not just power, you should learn how to garden and make sure you can filter your own water, get your own food, do what you gotta do to live.
[02:48:07.703 --> 02:48:08.104]  Thanks, man.
[02:48:08.942 --> 02:48:10.463]  I appreciate your call.
[02:48:10.463 --> 02:48:15.945]  It is important to become self-sufficient and at least not be completely dependent on the government.
[02:48:15.945 --> 02:48:27.070]  Everything the system is setting up, from the food production, to water, to energy, to the way the cities are laid out, is to control you and literally turn the whole country and world into a prison.
[02:48:27.070 --> 02:48:29.051]  And the Pentagon admits that.
[02:48:29.051 --> 02:48:34.293]  We've played UN clips here on air where they're openly talking about it.
[02:48:34.293 --> 02:48:36.915]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Texas.
[02:48:36.915 --> 02:48:37.655]  Tom, you're on the air.
[02:48:39.109 --> 02:48:40.130]  Thank you.
[02:48:40.130 --> 02:48:41.210]  First-time caller.
[02:48:41.210 --> 02:48:44.651]  Been listening for a while.
[02:48:44.651 --> 02:48:52.694]  I guess I just have one question, Alex, and I'm not trying to be a rabble-rouser or anything, but I'm pretty well fed up at this point.
[02:48:52.694 --> 02:48:55.335]  When do we start to stop this?
[02:48:55.335 --> 02:49:02.678]  And I mean, seriously, I don't think that we're going to have legitimate elections
[02:49:03.996 --> 02:49:07.078]  While these people are in power in this country anymore.
[02:49:07.078 --> 02:49:13.461]  I don't think the electoral process is immune anymore.
[02:49:13.461 --> 02:49:22.005]  Everything is done electronically now, so we don't know who has access to the information when we go to our precincts.
[02:49:22.005 --> 02:49:26.528]  And the government is building giant paramilitary armies against the people.
[02:49:26.528 --> 02:49:29.829]  I mean, there's no doubt we're in trouble, but we are having a lot of
[02:49:31.115 --> 02:49:35.718]  Success in waking people up and we're having victories at the state level.
[02:49:35.718 --> 02:49:37.339]  We're having victories in Congress.
[02:49:37.339 --> 02:49:41.923]  We're defeating their health care bill, their climate takeover bill, their carbon tax.
[02:49:41.923 --> 02:49:44.124]  We exposed their swine flu.
[02:49:44.124 --> 02:49:47.527]  The Wall Street Journal says, you know, the swine flu that fizzled.
[02:49:47.527 --> 02:49:51.149]  Record numbers of people didn't take it or the regular seasonal flu.
[02:49:51.149 --> 02:49:57.093]  And so we have a record low flu because the flu shot, as studies show, is giving people the flu.
[02:49:57.093 --> 02:49:58.294]  We're having so many victories.
[02:49:58.294 --> 02:49:59.375]  We're also having defeats.
[02:50:02.023 --> 02:50:06.166]  But people talk about physically stopping, and I mean, what do you do?
[02:50:06.166 --> 02:50:11.971]  I mean, I'm asking you that question, Tom.
[02:50:11.971 --> 02:50:13.953]  I mean, what do you physically do?
[02:50:13.953 --> 02:50:16.335]  What do I physically do?
[02:50:16.335 --> 02:50:17.455]  I'm a former Marine.
[02:50:17.455 --> 02:50:20.978]  I've been out for quite some time, and we were taught to adapt and overcome.
[02:50:20.978 --> 02:50:28.784]  We adapt, and we need to start adapting now in a physical sense, not just going on the Internet or
[02:50:29.804 --> 02:50:35.769]  Listening to shortwave or things of that nature, you need to physically adapt.
[02:50:35.769 --> 02:50:36.950]  Well, Tom, stay there.
[02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:38.571]  Tom, Tom, Tom, we got a break.
[02:50:38.571 --> 02:50:38.931]  Stay there.
[02:50:38.931 --> 02:50:40.573]  Don't hang up.
[02:50:40.573 --> 02:50:47.638]  Let's come back and talk about versus just listening to the radio or surfing the internet or passing videos around.
[02:50:47.638 --> 02:50:51.861]  What do we do physically that doesn't hurt anybody?
[02:50:51.861 --> 02:50:55.084]  And so I've got some ideas on the other side.
[02:50:55.084 --> 02:50:55.484]  Stay with us.
[02:50:55.484 --> 02:50:56.045]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.607 --> 02:51:05.169]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:51:05.169 --> 02:51:07.471]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:51:07.471 --> 02:51:08.331]  Don't!
[02:51:08.331 --> 02:51:11.774]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:51:11.774 --> 02:51:18.898]  Why pay, when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:51:18.878 --> 02:51:20.859]  's number one debt secret.
[02:51:20.859 --> 02:51:24.942]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:51:24.942 --> 02:51:27.644]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:51:28.064 --> 02:51:35.448]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:51:35.448 --> 02:51:36.629]  Herb K was right.
[02:51:36.629 --> 02:51:39.811]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:51:39.811 --> 02:51:41.171]  What have you got to lose?
[02:51:41.171 --> 02:51:44.873]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[02:51:44.873 --> 02:51:48.816]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[02:51:48.816 --> 02:51:49.176]  Call 888-352-7726.
[02:51:53.258 --> 02:51:53.678]  That's 888-352-7726.
[02:51:53.678 --> 02:51:53.738]  888-352-7726.
[02:51:53.738 --> 02:51:56.600]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:56.600 --> 02:51:59.161]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:59.161 --> 02:52:03.062]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:12.210 --> 02:52:14.871]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.871 --> 02:52:21.272]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.272 --> 02:52:26.814]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.814 --> 02:52:36.436]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.556 --> 02:52:38.918]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.918 --> 02:52:40.500]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.500 --> 02:52:42.962]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.962 --> 02:52:45.105]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:45.105 --> 02:52:50.250]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:50.250 --> 02:52:59.599]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:02.216 --> 02:53:08.922]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:53:08.922 --> 02:53:15.328]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:53:15.328 --> 02:53:21.294]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[02:53:21.634 --> 02:53:27.037]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[02:53:27.037 --> 02:53:35.202]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:53:35.202 --> 02:53:39.285]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[02:53:39.785 --> 02:53:44.469]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:53:44.469 --> 02:53:50.215]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.

[02:53:53.237 --> 02:53:53.918]  Or by calling 269-409-1776.
[02:53:53.918 --> 02:53:54.218]  269-409-1776 today!
[02:54:04.210 --> 02:54:29.176]  For more than 15 years before the war against the British kicked off in 1775, and officially kicked off July 4th, 1776, as much as FEMA and the media demonized the Founding Fathers, that's what July 4th is, that's what this country was founded on, was standing up against tyrants, the Founders didn't go out and get violent until the paramilitary police came to confiscate their guns.
[02:54:30.513 --> 02:54:36.241]  And if the government tries more WACOs, it will probably kick off a civil war.
[02:54:36.241 --> 02:54:44.353]  And then all of these effeminate, tough guy police and paramilitary with all their toys are in deep trouble.
[02:54:44.353 --> 02:54:45.835]  But I don't want some macho
[02:54:47.455 --> 02:54:50.477]  Point in my psyche, want this.
[02:54:50.477 --> 02:54:52.959]  Okay, I'm here trying to wake people up.
[02:54:52.959 --> 02:54:54.760]  I know the pen is mightier than the sword.
[02:54:54.760 --> 02:55:04.067]  We're having a big effect, but there's a lot we can do short of violence, civil disobedience, or legal banner hangs, or flyers.
[02:55:04.067 --> 02:55:08.951]  I mean, if enough people in every city file lawsuits, go to city council every week,
[02:55:10.032 --> 02:55:12.393]  Educate the public about what they put in the water supply.
[02:55:12.393 --> 02:55:14.995]  It's not just fluoride, it's hundreds of deadly chemicals.
[02:55:14.995 --> 02:55:19.937]  If you send people the EPA's own admissions, how it causes bone cancer.
[02:55:19.937 --> 02:55:21.778]  I mean, that's just one issue.
[02:55:21.778 --> 02:55:32.463]  Or if you point out how your cities, in 800 plus cities in the U.S., or sanctuary cities, where illegals can drunk drive, assault people, and don't even go to jail, and don't have to have IDs.
[02:55:32.463 --> 02:55:34.044]  You point out how that's discriminatory.
[02:55:36.098 --> 02:55:39.920]  I'm all for micro FM as long as it doesn't interfere with commercial stations.
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:53.486]  You know, people get the micro transmitters, goes out a few miles, put it up in your neighborhood, put a fly on every door once a month, you'll get a thousand people listening just in a mile circumference around you if you're in a built-up urban area.
[02:55:53.486 --> 02:55:57.788]  I mean, every person you wake up, every mind you unlock is huge.
[02:55:57.788 --> 02:56:01.229]  The Pentagon says 90% of their operations are psychological.
[02:56:01.229 --> 02:56:05.311]  We need to counter with the truth, which is the most powerful psychological tool out there.
[02:56:06.516 --> 02:56:09.326]  But, you know, you talk about physical...
[02:56:12.932 --> 02:56:14.233]  The system is intimidated.
[02:56:14.233 --> 02:56:15.154]  They are concerned.
[02:56:15.154 --> 02:56:16.494]  They can't get our guns.
[02:56:16.494 --> 02:56:17.615]  They're trying.
[02:56:17.615 --> 02:56:19.677]  They're failing on so many fronts.
[02:56:19.677 --> 02:56:21.438]  I mean, what else do you have to add, Tom?
[02:56:21.438 --> 02:56:33.506]  I mean, if we could get the public that's awake, 25-30% are really awake now, to go to city council, go to the statehouse, run for office, expose the electronic voting machines, get them removed.
[02:56:33.506 --> 02:56:36.388]  I mean, there's so much more we can do.
[02:56:36.388 --> 02:56:38.169]  And, you know, talk about just listening to the radio.
[02:56:38.169 --> 02:56:39.290]  We're not just listening to the radio here.
[02:56:39.870 --> 02:56:46.736]  I mean, I make books, films, materials that are, most of the time, I say, what woke you up?
[02:56:46.736 --> 02:56:47.517]  Oh, your films did.
[02:56:47.517 --> 02:56:48.838]  And then they wake up other people.
[02:56:48.838 --> 02:56:52.281]  I mean, we're not just here talking, we're here reaching people.
[02:56:52.281 --> 02:56:55.204]  That's why the media and the government push their stuff over media.
[02:56:55.204 --> 02:56:57.345]  Because this stuff has an effect.
[02:56:57.345 --> 02:57:00.328]  And people tune into this show, they're never the same.
[02:57:00.328 --> 02:57:03.010]  But I mean, what are you getting at, Tom?
[02:57:03.010 --> 02:57:05.673]  What I'm getting at is, you can
[02:57:06.761 --> 02:57:35.821]  You are the one person that we need on the airways, but we ourselves as individuals out here in the country, in the cities, in the towns, in the little burgs, you need to know who your neighbors are, you need to organize, you need to sit down and talk to each other and find out who you can rely on, who you can trust, because when the man comes through the door, he is going to do it at his advantage.
[02:57:37.236 --> 02:57:44.540]  He might stop you on your way home from the grocery store, and you might go into jail and disappear for a while.
[02:57:44.540 --> 02:57:45.180]  No, it's easy.
[02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:47.481]  I mean, they're tracking everybody's cell phone and live time.
[02:57:47.481 --> 02:57:48.742]  Let's pick Alex Jones up.
[02:57:48.742 --> 02:57:50.342]  He's going to the grocery store.
[02:57:50.342 --> 02:57:51.023]  Absolutely.
[02:57:51.023 --> 02:57:53.504]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[02:57:53.504 --> 02:57:55.285]  You can fall back on.
[02:57:55.285 --> 02:57:58.946]  You can't be an individual out here anymore.
[02:57:58.946 --> 02:58:04.109]  You have to have people in your community, and I know that there's a lot, a lot of people
[02:58:04.875 --> 02:58:10.357]  In these communities, in Texas, in every state in the United States, and you can get to know your neighbors.
[02:58:10.357 --> 02:58:16.799]  How many people do you know that live three or four or five blocks away from your house?
[02:58:16.799 --> 02:58:21.360]  I bet most people can count them on three fingers.
[02:58:21.360 --> 02:58:26.082]  Usually it's the guy behind you, the guy on the left or the right of you, and the guy directly across the street.
[02:58:27.059 --> 02:58:34.625]  Yeah, because everybody's got to get in there and turn the TV on and let it program them, instead of even knowing their neighbors, we're losing our humanity.
[02:58:34.625 --> 02:58:35.486]  I agree.
[02:58:35.486 --> 02:58:42.991]  Getting to know your neighbors, turning the television off, is the first step in destroying the globalists.
[02:58:42.991 --> 02:58:46.594]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:59:03.332 --> 02:59:12.076]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:59:12.076 --> 02:59:16.138]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:59:16.138 --> 02:59:18.099]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:59:20.564 --> 02:59:25.168]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:59:25.168 --> 02:59:28.991]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:59:28.991 --> 02:59:30.232]  Others don't.
[02:59:30.232 --> 02:59:32.374]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:59:32.374 --> 02:59:34.155]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:59:34.155 --> 02:59:37.057]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:59:46.385 --> 02:59:48.747]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:59:48.747 --> 02:59:49.608]  Others don't.
[02:59:54.238 --> 02:59:56.643]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.643 --> 02:59:59.428]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:07.096 --> 03:00:09.598]  We are now into the final hour.
[03:00:09.598 --> 03:00:12.701]  That Ron Paul interview was so important and only 15 minutes long.
[03:00:12.701 --> 03:00:15.924]  I'm going to air some parts of it coming up in the last few segments today.
[03:00:15.924 --> 03:00:18.386]  Got a lot of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[03:00:18.386 --> 03:00:22.229]  We're going to continue with your phone calls right now.
[03:00:22.229 --> 03:00:23.811]  Ben in Indiana.
[03:00:23.811 --> 03:00:24.471]  You're on the air.
[03:00:24.471 --> 03:00:25.112]  Thanks for holding.
[03:00:27.537 --> 03:00:28.498]  Thanks for getting me on the air.
[03:00:28.498 --> 03:00:32.298]  I just want to say thank you so much for all your work.
[03:00:32.298 --> 03:00:37.220]  Your films woke me up, and I'm getting your films out to other people, and it's waking them up.
[03:00:37.220 --> 03:00:46.042]  I guess probably the best thing, most effective thing people could do is get a big stack printer and print tons of Fall of the Republic out, or whichever one of your films loose change.
[03:00:46.042 --> 03:00:46.882]  Endgame, they're all great.
[03:00:48.579 --> 03:00:49.880]  Um, I disagree with the other caller.
[03:00:49.880 --> 03:01:01.969]  I think the Joe Stack thing does look like it's staged because of damage on the building for one, his intelligence connections, and it's really hard to believe that he loaded a barrel of... And you had the emergency crews there beforehand.
[03:01:01.969 --> 03:01:03.050]  That's now admitted.
[03:01:03.050 --> 03:01:05.952]  Multiple witnesses saw no one in the plane.
[03:01:05.952 --> 03:01:08.034]  You've got... It just goes on and on.
[03:01:08.034 --> 03:01:11.696]  It sounds cartoonish that he loaded a barrel of fuel into the back of his plane, too.
[03:01:11.696 --> 03:01:14.018]  I mean, it sounds like more cartoon physics explanations.
[03:01:15.290 --> 03:01:16.150]  Same with 9-11.
[03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:17.450]  They give you cartoon explanations.
[03:01:17.450 --> 03:01:19.131]  Oh, it evaporates.
[03:01:19.131 --> 03:01:23.451]  Oh, we found two passports within a few hours on the ground after all the buildings fell.
[03:01:23.451 --> 03:01:25.372]  Yeah.
[03:01:25.372 --> 03:01:26.072]  Exactly.
[03:01:26.072 --> 03:01:27.812]  We found an Easter Bunny out there, too.
[03:01:27.812 --> 03:01:29.753]  I'm sorry.
[03:01:29.753 --> 03:01:32.773]  I was going to say that the coffee party is a great idea.
[03:01:32.773 --> 03:01:42.675]  And I think it's awesome that you're going to go ahead with it anyway, even though they're trying to get a jump on it with the... What's her name?
[03:01:44.520 --> 03:01:45.600]  Obama.
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:48.261]  And that's being done, so people go, coffee party?
[03:01:48.261 --> 03:01:49.942]  You're with Obama!
[03:01:49.942 --> 03:01:57.865]  Instead of us having a coffee party that's more hardcore than the Republican-run Tea Party that they've taken over, now they'll go, you're with the coffee party?
[03:01:57.865 --> 03:02:02.327]  That's some kind of commie group!
[03:02:02.327 --> 03:02:08.769]  So I think, yeah, I think you can go with it right now and still get, you know, like you say, you have way more people on Facebook that'll jump on it and, uh,
[03:02:09.747 --> 03:02:18.497]  And maybe they'll come to our side, because I think a lot of these people are upset with Obama anyway, and we should really reach out to the Democrats who are starting to wake up.
[03:02:18.497 --> 03:02:20.439]  Man, I appreciate your call.
[03:02:20.439 --> 03:02:22.041]  Let's talk to Tom in Illinois.
[03:02:22.041 --> 03:02:22.862]  Tom, you're on the air.
[03:02:22.862 --> 03:02:26.586]  Hello?
[03:02:26.586 --> 03:02:28.188]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:28.188 --> 03:02:28.849]  Oh, this is Tony.
[03:02:28.849 --> 03:02:29.610]  I'm in Illinois.
[03:02:30.342 --> 03:02:32.945]  Yeah, thank you for waking my mind up.
[03:02:32.945 --> 03:02:33.465]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:02:33.465 --> 03:02:40.352]  My mind used to be in the gutter, but I've watched some of your videos, and I've ordered to call the Republic, and I'm about to start burning them and handing them out to people.
[03:02:40.352 --> 03:02:41.233]  And I have a question.
[03:02:41.233 --> 03:02:44.876]  I was wondering if Ron Paul was elected president, would he try?
[03:02:44.876 --> 03:02:47.599]  These people that committed treason against our country, would he try them?
[03:02:48.606 --> 03:02:51.367]  I know it would be dangerous to try one of them at a time.
[03:02:51.367 --> 03:02:56.228]  Well, Ron Paul would say under the Constitution, the President doesn't have that power.
[03:02:56.228 --> 03:03:02.050]  But I know he would call for criminal investigations of these people by the Justice Department.
[03:03:02.050 --> 03:03:11.953]  Yes, he said that the bankers have all openly committed crimes, the big private bank heads, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and others, and he's called for state grand juries to indict them.
[03:03:11.953 --> 03:03:13.193]  He's done that on this show before.
[03:03:14.306 --> 03:03:17.073]  I'm talking about the people in the government like President Bush and Cheney.
[03:03:17.073 --> 03:03:18.917]  They murder a lot of people.
[03:03:18.917 --> 03:03:20.942]  Millions of thousands of people.
[03:03:20.942 --> 03:03:22.546]  Cheney shot somebody in the face with a shotgun.
[03:03:23.956 --> 03:03:25.758]  That's just crazy how people can get away with that.
[03:03:25.758 --> 03:03:28.620]  If I were to do something like that, I'd be sending my life in prison.
[03:03:28.620 --> 03:03:30.102]  Well, it's even worse than that.
[03:03:30.102 --> 03:03:40.531]  I mean, Cheney, it's now been declassified, wanted to launch a nuclear attack on Russia on 8-8-8 in 2008, and it was on record that U.S.
[03:03:40.531 --> 03:03:45.536]  and Israeli-backed Georgians attacked South Ossetia, the Russian-held area, and
[03:03:48.683 --> 03:03:52.766]  The CNN said the Russians have attacked and five days later had to admit it wasn't true.
[03:03:52.766 --> 03:04:00.571]  And then I've got neocons criticizing me saying I made it up that the Russians attacked and that I'm a Ruski or something.
[03:04:00.571 --> 03:04:01.512]  I mean it's just, it's just...
[03:04:02.731 --> 03:04:09.734]  It's incredible the level of lies, of the things they will do, the things they will say.
[03:04:09.734 --> 03:04:14.317]  You know, they say, well, you work for the Iranians because you don't want to attack them.
[03:04:14.317 --> 03:04:17.598]  No, I don't want to have World War III start.
[03:04:17.598 --> 03:04:24.882]  Or they say, that Alex Jones, he works for Al Qaeda because he's saying it's a 9-11 inside job.
[03:04:24.882 --> 03:04:28.964]  I mean, I've had mainline publications say that with absolutely no proof.
[03:04:28.964 --> 03:04:30.324]  I mean, it's just asinine.
[03:04:33.029 --> 03:04:39.812]  You know, Ron Paul, if he got elected, would do good just to stay alive and try to audit the Fed and do some things like that.
[03:04:39.812 --> 03:04:43.594]  But, I mean, I can't speak for Ron Paul, what he would do if he was President.
[03:04:43.594 --> 03:04:45.795]  I think we focus too much on the President.
[03:04:45.795 --> 03:04:48.857]  We have 50 states under the Constitution.
[03:04:48.857 --> 03:04:51.138]  The federal government is out of control.
[03:04:51.138 --> 03:04:57.141]  We have to get control of our states and then get control of our federal government right now that's run by offshore banks that are out of control.
[03:04:58.181 --> 03:05:02.585]  Okay, let's talk to Alex, Ray, Marty and others.
[03:05:02.585 --> 03:05:06.629]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:05:06.629 --> 03:05:09.872]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:05:09.872 --> 03:05:14.617]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:05:15.417 --> 03:05:21.041]  Tremendous influence on our president and Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[03:05:21.041 --> 03:05:26.585]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:05:26.585 --> 03:05:36.231]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:05:36.331 --> 03:05:38.692]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:05:38.692 --> 03:05:40.273]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:05:40.273 --> 03:05:42.734]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:05:42.734 --> 03:05:44.856]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:05:44.856 --> 03:05:50.018]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:05:50.018 --> 03:05:59.123]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:07:01.001 --> 03:07:05.544]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:07:05.544 --> 03:07:06.465]  Number one.
[03:07:06.465 --> 03:07:09.888]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:07:09.888 --> 03:07:10.748]  Number two.
[03:07:10.748 --> 03:07:15.632]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:07:15.632 --> 03:07:16.393]  It's true.
[03:07:16.393 --> 03:07:21.256]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:07:21.256 --> 03:07:21.717]  Number three.
[03:07:22.057 --> 03:07:25.660]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:07:25.660 --> 03:07:30.364]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:07:30.364 --> 03:07:33.126]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:07:33.126 --> 03:07:36.468]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:07:37.589 --> 03:07:41.730]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:07:41.730 --> 03:07:46.791]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:07:46.791 --> 03:07:50.973]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:50.973 --> 03:07:52.753]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:52.753 --> 03:07:57.354]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:08:02.759 --> 03:08:05.521]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:05.521 --> 03:08:09.745]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.745 --> 03:08:13.388]  We are continuing with wide open phones.
[03:08:13.388 --> 03:08:21.355]  I'm going to take a few more calls right now, then I want to head on to some other news we haven't gotten to yet.
[03:08:21.355 --> 03:08:25.999]  But I want to say this to a lot of the new listeners out there who are tuning in.
[03:08:25.999 --> 03:08:29.102]  Everything we talk about on this show is documented on record.
[03:08:29.966 --> 03:08:49.232]  We do have an illegitimate, unelected, global corporate government openly set up, announcing that it's taking over our planet and that their final political aim is to shut off resources to the planet and have one-child policies and basically live like the communist Chinese.
[03:08:49.232 --> 03:08:55.534]  And earlier I played a CNN clip praising communism and Mao Zedong.
[03:08:55.534 --> 03:08:56.834]  I mean, this is really happening.
[03:09:00.038 --> 03:09:05.222]  And the police are out of control, the government is out of control.
[03:09:05.222 --> 03:09:07.524]  They are... I mean, this is tyranny.
[03:09:07.524 --> 03:09:11.947]  We know what corruption is, we know what tyranny is.
[03:09:11.947 --> 03:09:17.171]  I've got a stack of news, I covered some of it earlier, where states are passing taxes on food.
[03:09:17.171 --> 03:09:19.032]  Only the worst tyrannies do that.
[03:09:19.032 --> 03:09:22.975]  They're getting ready to pass carbon taxes even if the people don't want it.
[03:09:22.975 --> 03:09:26.058]  Direct taxes on the oil companies that they'll pass on to consumers.
[03:09:27.566 --> 03:09:35.471]  Taxes when you buy dinner that are going to go to state health care programs.
[03:09:35.471 --> 03:09:36.632]  I see articles every day.
[03:09:36.632 --> 03:09:37.912]  Here's USA Today.
[03:09:37.912 --> 03:09:40.594]  Police partner with license plate readers.
[03:09:40.594 --> 03:09:41.014]  Everywhere!
[03:09:41.014 --> 03:09:46.357]  They're tracking your license plate, where you go, not just when you go through toll roads.
[03:09:46.357 --> 03:09:53.301]  It's an Orwellian nightmare and they're using it to control the population and suppress the population.
[03:09:53.301 --> 03:09:54.282]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[03:09:55.444 --> 03:10:02.571]  And the average government bureaucrat or person that works for a corporation that's getting government contracts, they're arrogant.
[03:10:02.571 --> 03:10:03.612]  They think they're winners.
[03:10:03.612 --> 03:10:04.473]  They think it's funny.
[03:10:04.473 --> 03:10:06.174]  They have disdain for the public.
[03:10:06.174 --> 03:10:13.201]  And then so much of the general public has this attitude of, well, how does it affect me?
[03:10:14.889 --> 03:10:24.377]  You know, you'll tell somebody that tyranny's coming down on them and that they're in trouble, and that historically they should be worried, and that the establishment has stated all their evil designs, and they'll say, how does that affect me?
[03:10:24.377 --> 03:10:30.503]  It's like an arrogance, like they have an attitude that if they just say, how does that affect me, I don't care, that supposedly gives them power over it.
[03:10:35.168 --> 03:10:42.714]  The biggest thing is we need people to start respecting themselves again and believing in the power they have to say no to this system.
[03:10:42.714 --> 03:10:50.880]  And we need people to reach out to their friends, their family, their coworkers, their neighbors, their local government, with books, with videos, with materials.
[03:10:50.880 --> 03:10:51.981]  I mean, every caller calls in.
[03:10:51.981 --> 03:10:53.802]  I found your show because of your videos.
[03:10:53.802 --> 03:10:54.943]  Somebody gave me a copy.
[03:10:54.943 --> 03:10:56.485]  Almost everybody.
[03:10:56.485 --> 03:10:59.007]  It's over 90%.
[03:10:59.007 --> 03:11:03.230]  Most other talk show hosts or website people I talk to say, yeah, I woke up because of you.
[03:11:06.189 --> 03:11:07.650]  Now, I don't even want that credit.
[03:11:07.650 --> 03:11:10.051]  That's a dangerous position to be in.
[03:11:10.051 --> 03:11:14.334]  Because all the COINTELPRO and government media attacks come our way.
[03:11:14.334 --> 03:11:17.816]  But in the end, I've done my job because I woke people up with the truth.
[03:11:17.816 --> 03:11:25.802]  You know, I've done 2 hours, 3 hours, and 11 minutes today, and I haven't even plugged any of the books or videos.
[03:11:25.802 --> 03:11:29.104]  And we've got this great new video, A Lamp in the Dark, The Untold Story of the Bible.
[03:11:29.974 --> 03:11:31.635]  And how the New World Order tried to suppress it.
[03:11:31.635 --> 03:11:36.559]  Great new video from the folks that made the three-part series, America's Secret Beginnings.
[03:11:36.559 --> 03:11:43.465]  We have Fall of the Republic that gives you a wide-spectrum analysis of the entire system and what makes the globalists tick and how to stop them.
[03:11:43.465 --> 03:11:51.612]  How Weed Won the West exposes government drug dealing and how they want to use drug laws now against vitamins and minerals.
[03:11:51.612 --> 03:11:57.937]  Of course, Endgame covers the whole eugenics angle and what governs the New World Order's thought processes.
[03:12:01.687 --> 03:12:16.650]  And then, of course, we have this video that we covered yesterday, Shadow Government, that I didn't make but that we carry and discount, that covers the whole surveillance tracking grid and how it's run by a private global government.
[03:12:16.650 --> 03:12:18.070]  And we're now shipping this book.
[03:12:18.070 --> 03:12:23.271]  It officially comes out on the 8th, but I can now ship it because you'll get it on or around the 8th for all the pre-orders.
[03:12:23.271 --> 03:12:25.852]  Jesse Ventura, he's on next week.
[03:12:25.852 --> 03:12:26.232]  We've got
[03:12:28.223 --> 03:12:32.045]  Transforcaster Gerald Cilente was actually in Chile for the earthquake.
[03:12:32.045 --> 03:12:35.246]  He'll be joining us to talk about the deteriorating economy tomorrow.
[03:12:35.246 --> 03:12:38.608]  But Jesse Ventura, American Conspiracies.
[03:12:38.608 --> 03:12:41.629]  This book is $24.95 in hardback.
[03:12:41.629 --> 03:12:42.629]  Just came out.
[03:12:42.629 --> 03:12:43.650]  Covers a whole host of
[03:12:44.986 --> 03:12:54.298]  New World Order topics that Jesse Ventura exposes and discusses, government assassinations, government narcotics trafficking, New World Order, eugenics, it's all in here.
[03:12:54.298 --> 03:12:59.225]  It's $19.95 at InfoWars.com and no one has a deal anywhere near this.
[03:12:59.225 --> 03:13:02.969]  You can get Loose Change Final Cut, a preeminent 9-11 film that I produced.
[03:13:03.530 --> 03:13:04.390]  Free.
[03:13:04.390 --> 03:13:08.091]  Or you can get Reflections and Warnings, my final interview with Aaron Russo before he died.
[03:13:08.091 --> 03:13:11.312]  It's a documentary in its own right, 90 minutes long, with a bunch of extras.
[03:13:11.312 --> 03:13:17.954]  You can get one of those two films free when you order Jesse Ventura's American Conspiracies.
[03:13:17.954 --> 03:13:19.954]  So that's a $44.95 value for $19.95.
[03:13:19.954 --> 03:13:20.434]  More than 50% off.
[03:13:20.434 --> 03:13:21.275]  Right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:13:31.547 --> 03:13:33.069]  You can also call toll-free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[03:13:33.069 --> 03:13:35.371]  You can also write to me, InfoWars, write to InfoWars, P.O.
[03:13:35.371 --> 03:13:35.992]  Box 19549, that's P.O.
[03:13:35.992 --> 03:13:36.693]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[03:13:51.297 --> 03:13:57.301]  And yes, your purchase of the books and videos and materials makes this radio show possible, but that's secondary.
[03:13:57.301 --> 03:13:58.222]  These are great tools.
[03:13:58.222 --> 03:14:00.083]  You may know all about the New World Order.
[03:14:00.083 --> 03:14:02.565]  Give your friends and family this handsome book.
[03:14:02.565 --> 03:14:04.126]  They may read it.
[03:14:04.126 --> 03:14:07.829]  Or you can read the book and give them one of the DVDs.
[03:14:07.829 --> 03:14:14.513]  We've also got free t-shirt deals, a bunch of other, we've never cut prices down to this level, because my main mission is just to get this out.
[03:14:14.513 --> 03:14:20.117]  Lastly, before I go to more calls and then news, coming out on April 15th,
[03:14:22.315 --> 03:14:28.941]  Tax Day, Jason Burness's two plus hour film will be out.
[03:14:28.941 --> 03:14:31.304]  You can start pre-ordering it in about a week and a half.
[03:14:31.304 --> 03:14:43.636]  April 15th, this film, it's got the best, I mean, we've spent a lot of money on this film, 18 months in the making, three graphics guys working on it, Jason, Aaron Dykes, Rob Jacobson,
[03:14:46.082 --> 03:14:50.043]  And it's just a compendium of globalist crimes and then now what they're currently setting up.
[03:14:50.043 --> 03:14:52.023]  It really is a powerful film.
[03:14:52.023 --> 03:14:56.444]  And it's Invisible Empire, New World Order, Defined.
[03:14:56.444 --> 03:14:58.125]  And also we've got Police State 4.
[03:14:58.125 --> 03:15:02.706]  I haven't put a Police State film out since 2002.
[03:15:02.706 --> 03:15:03.606]  And I worked on this.
[03:15:03.606 --> 03:15:06.767]  It's got three directors, Rob Dew, Jason Douglas, Alex Jones.
[03:15:09.013 --> 03:15:17.908]  It's the FEMA camps, the New World Order, just all the latest police state grid information, two hour plus film, Police State 4.
[03:15:17.908 --> 03:15:19.431]  That's going to come out a week or so after.
[03:15:19.431 --> 03:15:22.275]  I haven't set the release date yet for Police State 4.
[03:15:22.275 --> 03:15:22.856]  The point is,
[03:15:24.420 --> 03:15:31.182]  If you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, you will see the films first on the release date, and the DVDs will ship then, in the highest quality.
[03:15:31.182 --> 03:15:42.306]  And you can download them, burn them to disk, DivX copies that play on most DVD players, my book, Paul Watson's book, my live radio slash TV show, better audio archives, video archives of the radio show every day.
[03:15:43.766 --> 03:15:46.668]  And in April, it'll be six years we've had PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:15:46.668 --> 03:15:51.631]  We just keep adding new functions and features and news and higher quality podcasts.
[03:15:51.631 --> 03:15:58.355]  It's 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month to get a PrisonPlanet.TV membership.
[03:15:58.355 --> 03:16:03.899]  And when you get a PrisonPlanet.TV membership for a year, instead of getting a trial monthly, you get three months free.
[03:16:03.899 --> 03:16:10.843]  And your membership, I want to thank those that are members, makes this radio show and what we do so much possible because our bandwidth bill
[03:16:12.416 --> 03:16:30.808]  uh... is massive and we are just exponentially growing so it's going up and up and up and up and the economy is falling apart so we're bringing in the same amount of money we were bringing in three years ago our audience in the last two years is actually quadrupled now.
[03:16:30.808 --> 03:16:39.554]  You can go to Alexa, all the rating sites and see it for yourself the radio audience has probably gotten ten times bigger the last three years but internet traffic
[03:16:40.558 --> 03:16:41.779]  Four times.
[03:16:41.779 --> 03:16:43.600]  It's actually doubled in the last year.
[03:16:43.600 --> 03:16:48.043]  So, when I say quadruple, that's an underestimation.
[03:16:48.043 --> 03:16:51.665]  But the same amount of money is coming in.
[03:16:51.665 --> 03:16:55.308]  So, we're okay, but I'm building the TV studio.
[03:16:55.308 --> 03:16:56.589]  That's been hell with the city.
[03:16:56.589 --> 03:16:59.671]  My God, six months of trying to get permits with these people.
[03:16:59.671 --> 03:17:02.533]  It's finally over, they're building it.
[03:17:02.533 --> 03:17:06.115]  And we live in such a communist country, it's just indescribable.
[03:17:10.287 --> 03:17:13.929]  The point is we're expanding, we're moving forward.
[03:17:13.929 --> 03:17:20.571]  I am building a mega social networking slash blog slash you name it meetup type site.
[03:17:20.571 --> 03:17:28.075]  We've now committed that's being built by a top firm here in Austin and consult consultation with my IT guys.
[03:17:29.583 --> 03:17:33.828]  And we're going to launch the coffee party, which was our listeners' idea that Obama has now stolen.
[03:17:33.828 --> 03:17:38.234]  I mean, to give you an idea of how good our ideas are that come from the listeners.
[03:17:38.234 --> 03:17:39.235]  So we've got to counter that.
[03:17:39.235 --> 03:17:43.680]  Everybody should start a coffee party and say, no, this is not your deal, Obama.
[03:17:43.680 --> 03:17:44.862]  All of that is going on.
[03:17:48.456 --> 03:17:53.661]  This Obama lady claims that the federal government is good and that we need to work through it and that that's the coffee party.
[03:17:53.661 --> 03:17:55.443]  She's worked for Obama.
[03:17:55.443 --> 03:17:57.104]  She's one of his minions.
[03:17:57.104 --> 03:18:00.408]  She claims she loves the Tea Party and wants them to join her coffee party.
[03:18:00.408 --> 03:18:01.869]  CNN, everybody else has had her on.
[03:18:01.869 --> 03:18:02.450]  They're pushing her.
[03:18:03.339 --> 03:18:04.680]  She's worked for the New York Times.
[03:18:04.680 --> 03:18:08.124]  They didn't tell you that when they wrote an article about how great she is.
[03:18:08.124 --> 03:18:13.950]  So now Obama, like the Republicans, posing as Tea Party people, Obama wants to come in with the Coffee Party and take it over.
[03:18:13.950 --> 03:18:16.252]  This is what she said on her Facebook about Tea Party people.
[03:18:20.418 --> 03:18:21.419]  Get some coffee.
[03:18:21.419 --> 03:18:24.660]  Get off your butt and join the movement for change.
[03:18:24.660 --> 03:18:26.241]  No more reading tea leaves.
[03:18:26.241 --> 03:18:27.182]  Get the job done.
[03:18:27.182 --> 03:18:28.682]  No more excuses.
[03:18:28.682 --> 03:18:30.884]  Stop the bad punditry.
[03:18:30.884 --> 03:18:33.125]  Stop reading tea leaves.
[03:18:33.125 --> 03:18:35.086]  We will overwhelm the polling stations in November.
[03:18:35.086 --> 03:18:35.846]  We want change.
[03:18:35.846 --> 03:18:38.308]  We want change.
[03:18:38.308 --> 03:18:42.630]  We must deal with reality instead of indulging in paranoid fantasies of the Tea Party.
[03:18:44.447 --> 03:18:46.107]  And it just goes on and on.
[03:18:46.107 --> 03:18:48.468]  We're not going to take this tea crap anymore.
[03:18:48.468 --> 03:18:49.948]  Let's work for change.
[03:18:49.948 --> 03:19:08.471]  So, this is her just two months ago, but now, oh, she wants to work with the tea parties and take them over with the coffee party to wake up the tea party, even using the slogan that my listeners, again, two months ago, emailing and calling, I don't even know who you are, saying, Alex, you need to launch this.
[03:19:08.471 --> 03:19:10.051]  You need to get it going.
[03:19:10.051 --> 03:19:12.772]  And I registered domains a month ago and just never did it.
[03:19:14.173 --> 03:19:16.875]  Obviously, I can't travel around the country and start rallies and do it.
[03:19:16.875 --> 03:19:25.241]  We'll just explain what the real Coffee Party is from the listeners and my idea of saying, look, the Republicans are taking over the Tea Parties.
[03:19:25.241 --> 03:19:26.602]  We want this to be nonpartisan.
[03:19:26.602 --> 03:19:28.743]  The Coffee Party is here to wake up the Tea Party.
[03:19:28.743 --> 03:19:31.845]  Don't be co-opted by the Republicans and Democrats.
[03:19:31.845 --> 03:19:34.727]  Now the Democrats are openly coming into co-op.
[03:19:34.727 --> 03:19:37.209]  They have to do this or they'll be replaced with the American people.
[03:19:39.019 --> 03:19:43.623]  But again, work through your states, take over your states peacefully, through the legislative process.
[03:19:43.623 --> 03:19:45.105]  We have the numbers.
[03:19:45.105 --> 03:19:47.207]  We can do this together.
[03:19:47.207 --> 03:19:57.777]  Your phone call is straight ahead with this article by Paul Watson, or it's actually Steve Watson, coffee party founder, is Obama campaign operative, is so important.

[03:20:31.207 --> 03:20:40.531]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[03:20:40.531 --> 03:20:41.332]  This capitalism?
[03:20:41.332 --> 03:20:47.595]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:20:47.595 --> 03:20:48.475]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:20:48.475 --> 03:20:51.737]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[03:20:51.737 --> 03:20:52.517]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[03:20:52.517 --> 03:20:53.598]  It's time to understand the system.
[03:20:53.598 --> 03:20:53.918]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:20:53.918 --> 03:20:54.258]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:21:02.322 --> 03:21:03.343]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:21:03.343 --> 03:21:08.888]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:21:08.888 --> 03:21:09.429]  I get it.
[03:21:09.429 --> 03:21:19.058]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:21:19.058 --> 03:21:20.459]  That's not what's happening.
[03:21:20.459 --> 03:21:24.823]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[03:21:25.043 --> 03:21:26.885]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[03:21:26.885 --> 03:21:28.927]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:21:28.927 --> 03:21:32.310]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:21:32.310 --> 03:21:36.594]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:21:36.594 --> 03:21:38.195]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:21:38.195 --> 03:21:41.598]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[03:21:41.598 --> 03:21:45.962]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:21:45.962 --> 03:21:46.863]  You should, too.
[03:21:46.863 --> 03:21:48.024]  Find out what they know.
[03:21:48.024 --> 03:21:51.267]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[03:21:51.527 --> 03:21:51.607]  800-686-2237.
[03:21:51.607 --> 03:21:51.667]  800-686-2237.
[03:21:51.667 --> 03:21:51.867]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:21:51.867 --> 03:21:54.448]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:54.448 --> 03:21:56.189]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:56.189 --> 03:21:57.630]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:22:12.384 --> 03:22:15.046]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:15.046 --> 03:22:21.430]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:21.430 --> 03:22:26.634]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.634 --> 03:22:36.621]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.741 --> 03:22:39.082]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:39.082 --> 03:22:40.662]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.662 --> 03:22:43.123]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:43.123 --> 03:22:45.243]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:45.243 --> 03:22:50.405]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:23:52.358 --> 03:23:52.839]  We love you!
[03:24:10.537 --> 03:24:12.257]  Let's go to Alex in California.
[03:24:12.257 --> 03:24:13.298]  Alex, you're on the air.
[03:24:13.298 --> 03:24:15.459]  Yeah, hi.
[03:24:15.459 --> 03:24:15.839]  Hi, Alex.
[03:24:15.839 --> 03:24:17.159]  Welcome.
[03:24:17.159 --> 03:24:20.240]  I was watching Fall of the Republic, and it's a great movie.
[03:24:20.240 --> 03:24:23.542]  There was just one point I noticed when you were talking about the Explorer program.
[03:24:23.542 --> 03:24:31.985]  They were training them to search out terrorists, and you called them, you were saying they were a co-affiliate of Boy Scouts, and that's what the article said.
[03:24:32.745 --> 03:24:35.507]  I just wanted to let you know I'm a long time Boy Scout.
[03:24:35.507 --> 03:24:36.447]  I'm an Eagle Scout.
[03:24:36.447 --> 03:24:39.489]  I'm the Assistant Scoutmaster of my troop right now.
[03:24:39.489 --> 03:24:42.951]  I teach my scouts nothing but patriotism.
[03:24:42.951 --> 03:24:46.053]  I point out like on the scout symbol there's a
[03:24:46.969 --> 03:24:48.169]  Sir, let me just throw this out.
[03:24:48.169 --> 03:24:53.351]  When I put that film out three months ago, four months ago, people didn't even believe that.
[03:24:53.351 --> 03:25:13.855]  Now the LAPD and a federal grant officially took over the Boy Scouts Explorer program and in the New York Times, I believe that was Arizona, the particular training, or was it New Mexico, they were training to take on disgruntled veterans and it showed photos of the mock dead veterans taken on by the 14-year-old Boy Scouts.
[03:25:13.855 --> 03:25:15.816]  So I know the Boy Scouts have been good,
[03:25:16.696 --> 03:25:20.980]  But just like Hitler took over the German Boy Scouts, the same thing is happening.
[03:25:20.980 --> 03:25:23.982]  And they've got Girl Scouts training to spy on people.
[03:25:23.982 --> 03:25:25.984]  I mean, that's Associated Press.
[03:25:25.984 --> 03:25:29.366]  This is really happening.
[03:25:29.366 --> 03:25:31.108]  Okay, I see that.
[03:25:31.108 --> 03:25:36.372]  Well, I just want to let you know as well, with my troop, that's not happening.
[03:25:36.372 --> 03:25:38.534]  And I assure you that I'm teaching my guys.
[03:25:40.114 --> 03:25:47.764]  Exactly, so we're trying to get the scouts of America to say no to Homeland Security taking it over.
[03:25:47.764 --> 03:25:49.727]  Yeah, that's what I've been doing.
[03:25:49.727 --> 03:25:55.395]  The scout symbol, like I was saying, the shield represents freedom and the scouts' readiness to defend freedom.
[03:25:55.395 --> 03:25:57.658]  And I make sure our scouts know that and other troops know that.
[03:25:58.294 --> 03:26:01.615]  Well, great job, Alex, but we're not saying the Boy Scouts are bad.
[03:26:01.615 --> 03:26:03.255]  We're saying it's being taken over.
[03:26:03.255 --> 03:26:07.076]  It's like saying the German military wasn't bad until Hitler got control of it.
[03:26:07.076 --> 03:26:12.158]  I mean, our country's been hijacked by offshore corporations, and they're turning everything into evil.
[03:26:12.158 --> 03:26:18.540]  And so there's a battle for the heart and soul of not just the Boy Scouts, but the Girl Scouts and the Brownies right now.
[03:26:18.540 --> 03:26:19.300]  Well, okay.
[03:26:19.300 --> 03:26:20.460]  I didn't know that, actually.
[03:26:20.460 --> 03:26:26.782]  That's good to get that information, and I'll take it up with, you know, with my council and my district and take it as high as I can to see
[03:26:27.386 --> 03:26:33.708]  You know, to make sure that it isn't put in because Boy Scouts are not meant to be trained as a militant group that search out terrorists.
[03:26:33.708 --> 03:26:40.450]  You know, they're just... Sir, I've got Boy Scout explorers out at checkpoints in Florida helping search people.
[03:26:40.450 --> 03:26:42.470]  I mean, it's far down the road.
[03:26:42.470 --> 03:26:45.171]  I appreciate your call.
[03:26:45.171 --> 03:26:47.031]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ray in Virginia.
[03:26:47.031 --> 03:26:48.372]  Ray, you're on the air.
[03:26:48.372 --> 03:26:49.532]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:26:49.532 --> 03:26:50.792]  Welcome.
[03:26:50.792 --> 03:26:52.493]  I'm here in Virginia.
[03:26:52.493 --> 03:26:55.694]  I'm son of the Revolutionary War, the American Revolutionary War.
[03:26:57.122 --> 03:27:03.207]  Directly related to Thomas Jefferson, I've been to Smithsonian, met Reagan, and all that kind of stuff.
[03:27:03.207 --> 03:27:10.414]  Our family rejected the Masons a while back, my grandpa, and we're American patriots.
[03:27:10.414 --> 03:27:19.101]  I fight the Agenda 21 all the time, been to the Wake County meeting, and trying to expose this globalist lie about global warming.
[03:27:19.101 --> 03:27:22.745]  It's just a religion, with Mikhail Gorbachev and Maurice Strong.
[03:27:23.550 --> 03:27:31.618]  Yeah, they say at Green Shield, with those two, that humans need a religion, and the religion will be that humans are bad.
[03:27:31.618 --> 03:27:37.664]  And that's what the UN says, and that's what this whole fake environmentalism is, is an excuse to cut off people's resources.
[03:27:38.851 --> 03:27:40.352]  That's exactly right.
[03:27:40.352 --> 03:27:41.432]  It's awful.
[03:27:41.432 --> 03:27:46.654]  And Maury Strong, he's a scumbag, and so is Mikel Gorbachev.
[03:27:46.654 --> 03:27:53.757]  They have in Baca, Colorado, their own, we went there and took pictures, they have their own temple set up for Gaia.
[03:27:53.757 --> 03:27:57.379]  This green Shrek-looking... Yeah, Maury Strong's wife runs that.
[03:27:58.883 --> 03:28:01.244]  I met her and did an interview with her.
[03:28:01.244 --> 03:28:09.027]  These people believe that Gaya came to them and told them to do this back in the 80s by the way.
[03:28:09.027 --> 03:28:11.548]  We've had Hunt on and others that were in those meetings.
[03:28:12.512 --> 03:28:19.719]  Oh yeah, I met Mr. Hunt, and when we were out there, we went out to California, and we're all over the place.
[03:28:19.719 --> 03:28:21.600]  We've been doing this in Wake County, North Carolina.
[03:28:21.600 --> 03:28:23.562]  They have a sustainable development meeting.
[03:28:23.562 --> 03:28:25.584]  Man, they're taking that whole city over, man.
[03:28:25.584 --> 03:28:34.873]  And like Little Rock, Arkansas, they're implementing a law... Sir, in Austin, they just take anybody's property they want, they openly give the property they steal to former mayors.
[03:28:35.393 --> 03:28:40.234]  They've hired a special forces commander, this was in the Statesman, to run all the land grabbing.
[03:28:40.234 --> 03:28:43.655]  They're going to put a $2.6 billion tax on energy in the next three years.
[03:28:43.655 --> 03:28:45.835]  In three years, $2.6 billion.
[03:28:45.835 --> 03:28:50.436]  They are just raping everyone, saying you can't pull well water without a license from LCRA.
[03:28:50.436 --> 03:28:52.537]  They're harassing the farms and ranches.
[03:28:52.537 --> 03:28:53.917]  And that's just where I live.
[03:28:53.917 --> 03:28:58.538]  I mean, it's just a descending group of vicious, control-freak criminals
[03:28:59.398 --> 03:29:02.024]  Who call their takeover environmentalism.
[03:29:02.024 --> 03:29:04.691]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[03:29:04.691 --> 03:29:08.038]  We have to route these devils out everywhere they are.
[03:29:08.038 --> 03:29:09.041]  I appreciate your call.
[03:29:09.855 --> 03:29:15.158]  Now I'm going to play part of the Ron Paul interview because we went live at the start of the last hour.
[03:29:15.158 --> 03:29:17.260]  Some stations don't carry that first five minutes.
[03:29:17.260 --> 03:29:18.120]  We skipped a break.
[03:29:18.120 --> 03:29:20.662]  I want people to hear what we talked about with Ron Paul.
[03:29:20.662 --> 03:29:31.929]  Government narcotics trafficking, world government, the awakening that's happening, so much coming up, then more calls and some other key news stories after we air part of this Ron Paul interview coming out of the next break.
[03:29:33.183 --> 03:29:35.284]  But I'll go back to what I was saying earlier in the hour.
[03:29:35.284 --> 03:29:38.846]  You hear the listeners calling in who were woken up with my films.
[03:29:38.846 --> 03:29:46.730]  The number one thing you can do is get Fall of the Republic, Endgame, Terror Storm, some of the best films I've made, and make copies and give them to people.
[03:29:46.730 --> 03:29:48.691]  Every person you wake up is invaluable.
[03:29:48.691 --> 03:29:49.951]  It's person to person.
[03:29:49.951 --> 03:29:51.872]  Nothing can stop you if you take action.
[03:29:51.872 --> 03:29:53.253]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.253 --> 03:29:55.794]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.794 --> 03:29:58.476]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.325 --> 03:30:08.311]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:30:08.311 --> 03:30:09.592]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:30:09.592 --> 03:30:10.413]  It's very real.
[03:30:10.413 --> 03:30:12.655]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:30:12.655 --> 03:30:14.296]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:30:14.296 --> 03:30:18.780]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:30:18.780 --> 03:30:21.342]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[03:30:27.347 --> 03:30:32.131]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[03:30:32.131 --> 03:30:34.974]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.

[03:33:09.566 --> 03:33:11.327]  Government cover-ups.
[03:33:11.327 --> 03:33:12.908]  You want answers?
[03:33:12.908 --> 03:33:13.809]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:13.809 --> 03:33:18.652]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:18.652 --> 03:33:22.695]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:33:29.392 --> 03:33:32.934]  We always look forward to our once-a-month visit with Congressman Ron Paul.
[03:33:32.934 --> 03:33:34.295]  He's gotta go in 14 minutes.
[03:33:34.295 --> 03:33:37.237]  I got my atomic clock to a key vote.
[03:33:37.237 --> 03:33:38.598]  Gotta be in a committee room.
[03:33:38.598 --> 03:33:39.498]  So he's with us now.
[03:33:39.498 --> 03:33:41.039]  I'm gonna move quickly.
[03:33:41.039 --> 03:33:44.742]  First off, Congressman, you won the straw poll at CPAC.
[03:33:45.943 --> 03:33:49.125]  Proving that most of the Republicans are not warmongering neocons.
[03:33:49.125 --> 03:33:51.547]  You got 84% approval rating in Texas.
[03:33:51.547 --> 03:33:54.329]  You won by a record 80% in the primary.
[03:33:54.329 --> 03:33:57.951]  Showing that America supports what you're doing.
[03:33:57.951 --> 03:34:02.435]  Can you comment on the fact that, well, your take on this?
[03:34:03.368 --> 03:34:11.195]  I was very pleased and somewhat surprised, but it was a delight to have won that CPAC vote.
[03:34:11.195 --> 03:34:15.759]  You know, what was interesting is, you know, the people who oppose us, they're still significant.
[03:34:15.759 --> 03:34:22.025]  If I get 32% of the vote, that means there's a large number still complaining, and they're part of the establishment.
[03:34:22.025 --> 03:34:30.112]  But what I thought was interesting is all the sour grapes that was expressed afterwards, they were complaining, and, oh, this is not for real, you know, like they did in the campaign.
[03:34:31.195 --> 03:34:39.197]  What was interesting is somebody said that, you know, what we need to do is for CPAC to have any credibility, they have to change the way they vote.
[03:34:39.197 --> 03:34:51.361]  So somebody made the suggestion that nobody under 25 would be allowed to vote, which means, and you know it too, that there are a lot of young people who are interested in what we're talking about, and I think that's fortunate.
[03:34:51.361 --> 03:34:52.641]  You know, the next generation is
[03:34:53.241 --> 03:34:56.543]  Not later on, but currently they're inheriting this mess.
[03:34:56.543 --> 03:35:05.047]  So I'm delighted to talk to young people, but this whole idea that the people who don't like us challenging the status quo, well, let's not let them vote next time.
[03:35:05.047 --> 03:35:15.513]  But I think that there's a lot of people who are coming our way every year, and you know in the last two or three years that there's been tremendous growth in our movement, and that makes me very encouraged.
[03:35:16.599 --> 03:35:17.299]  Absolutely.
[03:35:17.299 --> 03:35:22.801]  I want to cut to the chase here, and before we get into the banking situation.
[03:35:22.801 --> 03:35:29.984]  A few months ago, you were speaking at a Campaign for Liberty event, and you threw the gauntlet down, as you did back in the 80s in some videos I've seen.
[03:35:29.984 --> 03:35:34.026]  You said, we've had a CIA coup in America, they're bringing in the drugs.
[03:35:34.026 --> 03:35:39.748]  Most people don't know, in 96, the CIA Inspector General before Congress admitted that.
[03:35:40.428 --> 03:35:41.389]  But it's wider than that.
[03:35:41.389 --> 03:36:02.823]  We know Wall Street and the banking cartel, the Federal Reserve System, through Yale and other outfits, set up the OSS and CIA, and you came right out and basically said, this is our illegitimate government, and that ties into the banks engineering the financial collapse, now saying they're getting ready for an even bigger collapse sometime this year in a constitution of the world run by the banks.
[03:36:03.363 --> 03:36:05.565]  I have trouble naming names because I don't know all the names.
[03:36:20.735 --> 03:36:29.101]  The one thing I can verify is that the people who should have responsibility for our national security and intelligence gathering, the U.S.
[03:36:29.101 --> 03:36:32.143]  Congress, they have no idea what's going on.
[03:36:32.143 --> 03:36:33.584]  And that's the real problem.
[03:36:36.325 --> 03:36:37.526]  It fits together.
[03:36:37.526 --> 03:36:42.047]  You know, the secrecy of the CIA, as well as the secrecy of the Fed.
[03:36:42.047 --> 03:36:44.568]  They control the money and they control secret government.
[03:36:44.568 --> 03:36:48.250]  People have referred to the CIA as a secret army for the President.
[03:36:48.250 --> 03:36:56.233]  But sometimes I wonder whether the President even has total control of the CIA, as well as many stories have been written about that.
[03:36:57.454 --> 03:37:02.157]  So it's something that I think the American people have to realize.
[03:37:02.157 --> 03:37:08.380]  We do know there's been evidence brought forth that the CIA actually can own banks.
[03:37:08.380 --> 03:37:14.344]  And there's been fairly strong evidence that the CIA's been involved in drug dealing.
[03:37:14.344 --> 03:37:21.449]  There are times when I think the war in Afghanistan, we say it has to do with pipes and oil, gas pipeline and oil.
[03:37:22.069 --> 03:37:22.630]  I think so.
[03:37:37.452 --> 03:37:52.189]  I don't take the position that I know all those answers, and I don't know everything that the Fed does, but my approach is that we, the people, the people deserve, and the Congress has a responsibility to find out what they're doing.
[03:37:52.789 --> 03:37:55.071]  And if they're not doing it, fine and dandy.
[03:37:55.071 --> 03:37:55.891]  We'll clear the air.
[03:37:55.891 --> 03:38:06.138]  But if they are doing it, it will give us more ammunition for the reason why we need a different monetary system and we need to have a different system of collecting intelligence because they can tell us anything.
[03:38:06.138 --> 03:38:08.099]  Remember how we went to war in Iraq?
[03:38:08.099 --> 03:38:10.120]  The CIA was very much involved.
[03:38:10.120 --> 03:38:14.963]  Up there, they say the CIA, oh, they have weapons of mass destruction.
[03:38:14.963 --> 03:38:16.684]  They're about to attack us.
[03:38:16.684 --> 03:38:18.806]  And it was based on false information.
[03:38:19.446 --> 03:38:28.452]  And this is what disturbs me the most, and that's why I want much, much more transparency of what our government is doing.
[03:38:28.452 --> 03:38:32.674]  Well, those were strong statements you made a few months ago, and you just echoed them.
[03:38:32.674 --> 03:38:40.018]  But specifically, Congress, as you know, has had hearings in the 70s about the shadow government, continuity of government.
[03:38:40.018 --> 03:38:44.821]  The Homeland Security Committee in the House has not been allowed to see the full text of PDD 51.
[03:38:46.142 --> 03:38:51.627]  We know we've seen a 12-fold in the last eight-year increase in opium out of Afghanistan.
[03:38:51.627 --> 03:39:03.476]  We know that two years ago, a CIA aircraft that had been used for torture flights crashed in Mexico with pure cocaine, three and a half tons, meaning coming directly from the source, uncut.
[03:39:03.476 --> 03:39:07.759]  I mean, this just comes out in Mena, Arkansas, over and over again.
[03:39:07.759 --> 03:39:11.482]  And so when you talk about a coup over America,
[03:39:12.663 --> 03:39:15.224]  How do we ever ferret this out and remove it?
[03:39:15.224 --> 03:39:19.746]  I mean, do we start, as you've been calling for, an audit of the private Federal Reserve?
[03:39:19.746 --> 03:39:22.968]  Yeah, it won't happen until the people become really outraged.
[03:39:22.968 --> 03:39:33.553]  They are growing in their outrage, but it has to translate into different ideas and different respect for the Constitution, different people up here, and we're in the midst of this transition.
[03:39:34.273 --> 03:39:44.357]  As the crisis worsens, you know, the real challenge is will we end up with a dictatorship or are we going to have people who are demanding, you know, a republic and open government?
[03:39:44.357 --> 03:39:48.239]  And that might take another 10, 15 years to determine.
[03:39:48.239 --> 03:39:51.280]  But in the midst of a crisis, it's the worst time to present our views.
[03:39:51.980 --> 03:40:15.724]  That's why we have to do our best to get as many people to agree with us as possible so that in the rebuilding that we have some ideas about what the monetary system should be like and what our foreign policy ought to be like, which means that if we have proper foreign policy, the incentive to have this CIA making excuses for knowing everything about us and everything that's going on in the world,
[03:40:16.104 --> 03:40:16.964]  That would all change.
[03:40:16.964 --> 03:40:28.266]  I don't believe that we shouldn't have some intelligence gathering, but I don't like these clandestine operations and killings and things that we've known to have happen.
[03:40:28.266 --> 03:40:43.929]  Well, dovetailing with that, you grilled Bernanke a few days ago, and then the chairman, for those who haven't seen the video, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, Frank, agreed with you and said, we need an investigation of the admitted, and I went and pulled the articles up.
[03:40:44.289 --> 03:40:44.689]  Yeah.
[03:41:00.774 --> 03:41:05.138]  Tens of billions of drug money has been found in the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
[03:41:05.138 --> 03:41:08.241]  That was in 2000, that was in the AP.
[03:41:08.241 --> 03:41:10.984]  And then Bernanke just laughs at you and says it doesn't exist.
[03:41:10.984 --> 03:41:25.198]  It's like POTOC from the Southern Poverty Law Center laughing and saying these Tea Party kooks believe in a world government when you've got every global leader calling for global government, the IMF calling for a new world order, Herman Van Rompuy, Ban Ki-moon calling for it.
[03:41:25.678 --> 03:41:29.883]  I mean, I think they're really destroying what credibility they had left by stonewalling us.
[03:41:29.883 --> 03:41:41.297]  Can you speak specifically to congressional investigations separate from an audit, just directly on, you know, is the Federal Reserve involved in Greece?
[03:41:41.297 --> 03:41:44.321]  Well, we know they gave the money to Goldman Sachs and we know they are involved.
[03:41:45.442 --> 03:41:55.224]  No, and he used the word bizarre, so he was accusing me of being bizarre, which means anybody who agrees with my concerns are considered bizarre as well.
[03:41:55.224 --> 03:42:02.426]  And you're right in commenting about what Barney Frank said at the end, at the end of my questioning, that we should look into it.
[03:42:02.426 --> 03:42:09.128]  And to his credit, he has sent a letter to the chairman, Bernanke, and Carbon copied me.
[03:42:09.948 --> 03:42:26.902]  And he's insisting that the Federal Reserve respond to my charges, look into it, he asked Bernanke to contact my office to go over the details of the concerns that I've had, and then report back.
[03:42:27.362 --> 03:42:33.284]  So, Barney Frank did follow up with, interestingly, Barney Frank was involved with Henry Gonzales.
[03:42:33.284 --> 03:42:39.366]  And you know that Henry Gonzales was against the Federal Reserve and demanded these investigations.
[03:42:39.366 --> 03:42:45.749]  And the gentleman that wrote the book from the University of Texas, he worked with Gonzales.
[03:42:45.749 --> 03:42:47.289]  So he has first-hand information.
[03:42:47.289 --> 03:42:50.631]  To call this bizarre is off the wall.
[03:42:50.631 --> 03:42:56.753]  Arbach was in the Federal Reserve and the Congress.
[03:42:57.153 --> 03:43:05.059]  On the Banking Committee for 17 years, and was involved in these investigations, and to just write it off and say, this is, I've never heard it.
[03:43:05.059 --> 03:43:18.810]  So, you know, when he said that, it sort of reminded me about, you know, the debates when the mayor, you know, shouted, and I can't believe this stuff, you know.
[03:43:18.810 --> 03:43:19.591]  What are you saying?
[03:43:20.655 --> 03:43:21.596]  It's incredible.
[03:43:21.596 --> 03:43:23.717]  We've only got four minutes left with Congressman Ron Paul.
[03:43:23.717 --> 03:43:26.339]  We appreciate him joining us live today.
[03:43:26.339 --> 03:43:34.045]  The New York Times is reporting they may try to revive the carbon tax with a direct tax on fuel at the refinery.
[03:43:34.045 --> 03:43:40.850]  Senate trio hopes to hit pay dirt with carbon fee at the oil company's request.
[03:43:40.850 --> 03:43:43.432]  Where is the carbon tax going as well as health care?
[03:43:44.107 --> 03:43:52.933]  Well, it's hard for me to believe they'll do that, even though it's alive and they want to, and that's their goal, and they will if they can.
[03:43:52.933 --> 03:43:59.717]  But under these conditions, it's so bad of an idea, it just blows my mind to think that they'll pursue that.
[03:43:59.717 --> 03:44:08.083]  Though I don't know the details on whether that's going to go through or not, but I can guarantee you there's plenty up here who still believe in it and will pursue it.
[03:44:08.083 --> 03:44:12.066]  But I hope they come to their senses and realize how detrimental it would be.
[03:44:12.776 --> 03:44:16.420]  There's a Mary Landrieu quote in here saying, we need to pass this.
[03:44:16.420 --> 03:44:18.742]  This is going to help Americans.
[03:44:18.742 --> 03:44:19.623]  I mean, how bizarre.
[03:44:19.623 --> 03:44:21.805]  More taxes, people are going bankrupt.
[03:44:21.805 --> 03:44:29.173]  In closing, Congressman, we've now discovered that an Obama campaign operative has founded a coffee party.
[03:44:29.173 --> 03:44:35.739]  I actually had this idea with listeners two months ago to get real constitutionalists to take the tea parties back from the neocons.
[03:44:36.820 --> 03:44:48.527]  Now it turns out Obama picked up this idea and that his campaign operatives are now getting all this media attention to tell us to love our federal government, that it's our federal government.
[03:44:48.527 --> 03:44:59.013]  I mean, that shows how powerful the Tea Parties are, if not just the Republican establishment, but now the Democrats are flooding in trying to pose as patriots.
[03:45:01.055 --> 03:45:02.616]  Yeah, they want us to love the government.
[03:45:02.616 --> 03:45:06.499]  How about loving our country and understanding what freedom is all about?
[03:45:06.499 --> 03:45:08.140]  But the battle is out there.
[03:45:08.140 --> 03:45:20.650]  I mean, one thing is they're starting to recognize that the battle may be outside of the conventional wisdom of Republicans and Democrats that run Washington and actually the discussion going on in the independent Tea Party type movement.
[03:45:20.650 --> 03:45:28.756]  And there's no reason to think that everybody is going to believe the right thing and get together and do the right thing in those who are objecting.
[03:45:29.176 --> 03:45:42.157]  But anybody who's involved better realize that if a significant movement erupts like the Tea Party movement, there will be plenty left and right, and everybody else who has a special interest will want to get in and try to control it.
[03:45:43.015 --> 03:45:46.778]  Well, to see the establishment trying to pose as anti-establishment is truly sickening.
[03:45:46.778 --> 03:45:49.080]  But, I mean, look at your 84% approval rating.
[03:45:49.080 --> 03:45:50.541]  People know the real McCoy.
[03:45:50.541 --> 03:45:51.702]  One minute left.
[03:45:51.702 --> 03:45:52.363]  The economy.
[03:45:52.363 --> 03:46:04.312]  A lot of top economists are now agreeing with you and others that we may have a mega-depression in the next 16 months, and they're positioning the IMF and World Bank with a new global constitution where they will pose as saviors again.
[03:46:04.312 --> 03:46:08.676]  How concerned are you that this recession could get a lot worse?
[03:46:09.124 --> 03:46:21.375]  Well, I think it is going to get a lot worse, and what is happening now is Wall Street's recovered and a few companies have recovered, but the unemployment rate is still very high and getting worse.
[03:46:21.375 --> 03:46:32.806]  And there will be plans, I'm sure they've been talking about it for quite a few years, because those who run the international banking system know that they're in trouble, so they are laying plans for this.
[03:46:33.759 --> 03:46:42.825]  People do ask me about, well, do you think this will bring on the North American Union and, you know, North American currency?
[03:46:42.825 --> 03:46:44.086]  And I really don't think so.
[03:46:44.086 --> 03:46:51.331]  I think the bigger concern should be a worldwide currency and the IMF and the United Nations grabbing hold and trying to dictate to us.
[03:46:51.331 --> 03:47:01.017]  But we have economic laws on our side because, you know, you can propose these things and even if it does serve the special interest, if it violates economic law, it won't work.
[03:47:01.017 --> 03:47:03.239]  So they can't maintain a good currency.
[03:47:03.599 --> 03:47:06.681]  And that's why I think the European Union is very, very fragile.
[03:47:06.681 --> 03:47:10.523]  Not only the Euro, but the Union as well, because it's artificial.
[03:47:10.523 --> 03:47:15.386]  And I think that's what would happen on a world government and a world currency.
[03:47:15.386 --> 03:47:25.272]  But in the meantime, it could get pretty messy, and they're going to work very hard to get organized, which means they'll work hard to undermine our personal liberties.
[03:47:25.942 --> 03:47:27.324]  All right.
[03:47:27.324 --> 03:47:43.926]  That's most of the interview I did with Ron Paul live earlier, but he wasn't with us for 30 minutes, but a vote came up, so I went live right at the start of the hour in the first five minutes, and I know some stations don't carry that, and he talked about such incredibly weighty issues that I wanted to go back over that.
[03:47:45.270 --> 03:47:53.552]  I have articles here where Germany, that pretty much runs the EU, is saying, we're not going to help Greece with any other loans.
[03:47:53.552 --> 03:47:59.633]  Now Goldman Sachs goes in, they're the key manager for the private central banks, a decade ago.
[03:47:59.633 --> 03:48:05.474]  And they tell Greece how to create a double set of books, this is now even in Reuters.
[03:48:05.474 --> 03:48:07.395]  They tell them how to invest in derivatives.
[03:48:08.533 --> 03:48:18.317]  Which internal documents that came out last year in McClatchy News Service prove they premeditatedly did it here in Iceland and Greece and Spain and a bunch of other nations.
[03:48:18.317 --> 03:48:27.121]  It's the same thing the IMF and World Bank do as the holding companies for these private brokerage firms and banks in the third world in the last 150 years.
[03:48:27.121 --> 03:48:30.642]  They go in, they give the government a bunch of money at 30-40% compounding interest.
[03:48:33.203 --> 03:48:41.312]  And they tell them in the internal agreements that have come out, don't pay this back, and then you're going to give us your water, your roads, your infrastructures, your government.
[03:48:41.312 --> 03:48:46.177]  And then it doesn't matter who gets in office after that, or if it's a dictator or whatever the case is,
[03:48:47.574 --> 03:48:52.455]  The banks now run it, and they do this out of fiat money backed up by U.S.
[03:48:52.455 --> 03:48:54.116]  and European taxpayer money.
[03:48:54.116 --> 03:49:09.139]  Now this new banking system that they're setting up, this Bank of the World, this new constitution of and by the banks, they will break their bonds with even Western governments, who they're now imploding, like third world nations, and issue their own global-backed currencies.
[03:49:09.139 --> 03:49:13.200]  They'll still have a euro, still have a dollar, still have a yen, a yon, but globally
[03:49:13.880 --> 03:49:17.742]  This private banking cartel will set the value of those currencies.
[03:49:17.742 --> 03:49:28.047]  Then they can play them off against each other and their own internal documents show, came out in 2002, IMF World Bank documents got leaked when Stiklitz left, Nobel Prize winner.
[03:49:28.047 --> 03:49:31.128]  That Economist World Bank was an IMF.
[03:49:31.128 --> 03:49:34.550]  The point is, documents from both banks talking to each other came out.
[03:49:34.550 --> 03:49:38.832]  Look up Stiklitz, he was IMF Chief Economist, wasn't it?
[03:49:38.832 --> 03:49:41.333]  Point is, that it came out
[03:49:43.223 --> 03:49:49.187]  That it was all premeditated and they set this up in third world countries and we're now planning to do it in the West.
[03:49:49.187 --> 03:49:56.471]  In Iceland, they claim they owe 10 times or more the entire GDP and wealth of the nation.
[03:49:56.471 --> 03:50:06.397]  Then Iceland said no and the bankers said, oh wait a minute, don't kick us completely out after we threatened you and threatened to use anti-terror laws on you internationally to put sanctions on you.
[03:50:06.397 --> 03:50:06.817]  Guess what?
[03:50:06.817 --> 03:50:09.999]  It turns out our banks have assets in your country already that'll pay this off.
[03:50:11.431 --> 03:50:21.953]  Well, when Greece went under by design, they openly put in as their new banking minister, a Goldman Sachs executive.
[03:50:21.953 --> 03:50:23.574]  That's the key group managing all this.
[03:50:23.574 --> 03:50:28.455]  They all make money off of it, but that's the key inner criminal circle managing it.
[03:50:28.455 --> 03:50:34.536]  And Europe's saying, we're not gonna give you any money to bail you out.
[03:50:34.536 --> 03:50:38.437]  You must give your private, you must give your government islands
[03:50:40.069 --> 03:50:41.910]  To the banks.
[03:50:41.910 --> 03:50:44.711]  And so, Greece is being fully stripped.
[03:50:44.711 --> 03:50:46.472]  Their people are rioting.
[03:50:46.472 --> 03:50:49.354]  Same thing is happening in Indonesia.
[03:50:49.354 --> 03:50:52.215]  They know what it means when the government bails out banks.
[03:50:52.215 --> 03:50:54.516]  They know it's a robbery.
[03:50:54.516 --> 03:50:55.857]  Because they've been through this before.
[03:50:55.857 --> 03:50:57.878]  We're going to continue breaking this down.
[03:50:57.878 --> 03:50:59.078]  Because this is the main issue.
[03:50:59.078 --> 03:51:00.059]  This is the top issue.
[03:51:00.059 --> 03:51:00.479]  Straight ahead.
[03:51:03.439 --> 03:51:05.080]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[03:51:05.080 --> 03:51:16.508]  Crowded public places, global pandemics, and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ-killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[03:51:16.508 --> 03:51:17.488]  There is!
[03:51:17.488 --> 03:51:21.211]  It's called Sinophresh Homeopathic Nasal Spray, and it's a proven germ killer.

[03:51:59.589 --> 03:52:00.129]  It works.
[03:52:03.169 --> 03:52:07.216]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.216 --> 03:52:10.442]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.442 --> 03:52:11.865]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:12.709 --> 03:52:15.231]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.231 --> 03:52:21.637]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.637 --> 03:52:27.181]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:27.181 --> 03:52:36.829]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.929 --> 03:52:39.270]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.270 --> 03:52:40.850]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.850 --> 03:52:43.311]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.311 --> 03:52:45.432]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.432 --> 03:52:50.594]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.594 --> 03:52:55.596]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:52:55.596 --> 03:52:59.698]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:02.349 --> 03:53:03.590]  Global meltdowns.
[03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:05.012]  Massive unemployment.
[03:53:05.012 --> 03:53:06.213]  Endless wars.
[03:53:06.213 --> 03:53:07.874]  A new currency crisis.
[03:53:07.874 --> 03:53:09.956]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[03:53:09.956 --> 03:53:12.098]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[03:53:12.098 --> 03:53:14.000]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[03:53:14.000 --> 03:53:16.082]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[03:53:16.082 --> 03:53:18.064]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[03:53:18.064 --> 03:53:24.070]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[03:53:26.749 --> 03:53:27.109]  I think so.
[03:53:56.829 --> 03:54:00.333]  Joseph Stiklitz was the chief economist at the World Bank.
[03:54:00.333 --> 03:54:05.738]  Okay.
[03:54:05.738 --> 03:54:08.220]  Here's an article out of
[03:54:21.806 --> 03:54:22.907]  Germany.
[03:54:22.907 --> 03:54:29.190]  German member of parliament suggests cash-strapped Greece should sell islands.
[03:54:29.190 --> 03:54:33.592]  There's another headline here where German government says no aid to Greece.
[03:54:33.592 --> 03:54:45.037]  They will go under and the banks will come in and get everything on pennies on the dollar out of fiat currency they loaned them and derivatives that Goldman Sachs set them up under.
[03:54:45.037 --> 03:54:46.278]  And their people are rioting.
[03:54:47.904 --> 03:55:05.211]  That's the future of the United States and all these politicians are now out on the news saying we're going to have a Great Depression and everything's going to fall apart in the next 16 months if we don't give ultimate power over to these private banks and pass the carbon tax to fund it and all these other taxes.
[03:55:05.211 --> 03:55:07.412]  Here's philly.com.
[03:55:07.412 --> 03:55:10.253]  Taxes on soft drinks or any sweet drink.
[03:55:10.253 --> 03:55:13.314]  I mean it just goes on and on.
[03:55:13.314 --> 03:55:15.475]  Taxes on food.
[03:55:15.475 --> 03:55:16.736]  Taxes on everything.
[03:55:18.331 --> 03:55:38.321]  Meanwhile, you've got the scammer Al Gore caught in unmitigated fraud and lies about sea levels, dying penguins and polar bears, global warming, caught red-handed in fraud, just like they gave a peace prize to Obama expanding all these wars as part of a sick joke, UT, University of Tennessee, to give him honorary degree.
[03:55:38.321 --> 03:55:39.842]  Oh, thank you for lying to us.
[03:55:39.842 --> 03:55:42.904]  Thank you for making a billion dollars off your scam so far.
[03:55:42.904 --> 03:55:44.564]  Thank you for wanting to destroy U.S.
[03:55:44.564 --> 03:55:44.965]  industry.
[03:55:45.865 --> 03:55:47.387]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[03:55:47.387 --> 03:55:49.028]  It just gets more and more ridiculous.
[03:55:49.028 --> 03:55:51.070]  We have to despise these people.
[03:55:51.070 --> 03:55:52.872]  We have to expose them.
[03:55:52.872 --> 03:55:54.613]  We have to reveal them.
[03:55:54.613 --> 03:56:01.500]  We have to let the people understand just how serious this tyrannical takeover is.
[03:56:03.052 --> 03:56:04.753]  The public knows they're in pain.
[03:56:04.753 --> 03:56:06.795]  They know they're losing their jobs and getting pay cuts.
[03:56:06.795 --> 03:56:08.877]  They know the economy's falling apart.
[03:56:08.877 --> 03:56:18.224]  And on top of the depression that these banks engineered, they can't get the Congress to pass their carbon taxes, so they're just coming to the county level, city level, state level.
[03:56:18.224 --> 03:56:21.627]  They're having Obama, through the regulations, do it.
[03:56:21.627 --> 03:56:23.288]  This is outrageous, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:56:23.288 --> 03:56:27.452]  They think you're so stupid, they announce, we're watching you over your laptops without warrants at home.
[03:56:28.291 --> 03:56:29.192]  Your school children.
[03:56:29.192 --> 03:56:30.233]  We're spying on you.
[03:56:30.233 --> 03:56:32.815]  We're reading your license plates everywhere you go.
[03:56:32.815 --> 03:56:33.896]  We're building more prisons.
[03:56:33.896 --> 03:56:35.157]  We're hiring more police.
[03:56:35.157 --> 03:56:38.701]  The federal government grew by 15% in the last month.
[03:56:38.701 --> 03:56:40.242]  It tripled under Bush.
[03:56:40.242 --> 03:56:43.285]  It quadrupled under Obama the first year.
[03:56:43.285 --> 03:56:48.670]  More money than all the government spent in the 235 years previous to that.
[03:56:48.670 --> 03:56:49.691]  That's an official number.
[03:56:50.896 --> 03:56:52.618]  They're going for broke.
[03:56:52.618 --> 03:56:59.505]  Once you've committed this many crimes, once you've done this much unconstitutional, lawless crap, why not make us go through naked body scanners?
[03:56:59.505 --> 03:57:01.367]  Why not stage terror attacks?
[03:57:01.367 --> 03:57:05.671]  Why not totally just throttle everyone and beat them into submission?
[03:57:05.671 --> 03:57:06.572]  What comes next?
[03:57:08.851 --> 03:57:11.492]  They're quietly training police for martial law nationwide.
[03:57:11.492 --> 03:57:13.232]  It's coming out in mainstream newspapers everywhere.
[03:57:13.232 --> 03:57:15.493]  They've got military running checkpoints all over the country.
[03:57:15.493 --> 03:57:16.933]  From Texas to California.
[03:57:16.933 --> 03:57:18.114]  From Michigan to Florida.
[03:57:18.114 --> 03:57:20.735]  They're openly training an NLEO-9 with FEMA.
[03:57:20.735 --> 03:57:24.016]  Troops from 14 countries to take on American citizens.
[03:57:24.016 --> 03:57:29.837]  All of this unspeakable stuff is now not conspiracy theory because insiders were warning us decades ago.
[03:57:29.837 --> 03:57:31.358]  It's now out in the open!
[03:57:33.516 --> 03:57:36.939]  And you have a decision to make.
[03:57:36.939 --> 03:57:38.720]  Are you going quietly into the night?
[03:57:38.720 --> 03:57:39.981]  Are you going to go along with this?
[03:57:39.981 --> 03:57:45.726]  Are you going to not have enough respect for yourself to realize that you are the leaders we need out there?
[03:57:45.726 --> 03:57:46.627]  You know you're good.
[03:57:46.627 --> 03:57:48.048]  You know you're pure of heart.
[03:57:48.048 --> 03:57:49.169]  You know you're honorable.
[03:57:49.169 --> 03:57:51.111]  You know you're anti-New World Order.
[03:57:51.111 --> 03:57:54.413]  You need to start websites, make your own films, access TV.
[03:57:55.274 --> 03:57:59.679]  Broker time on local radio, put out newsletters, go to city council.
[03:57:59.679 --> 03:58:01.801]  Everybody doing a little something.
[03:58:01.801 --> 03:58:04.103]  Everybody that calls me wants to do some big grand plan.
[03:58:04.103 --> 03:58:04.804]  No.
[03:58:04.804 --> 03:58:08.307]  It's lots of little actions that are going to defeat and bring these people down.
[03:58:09.212 --> 03:58:12.214]  We had Larry Pratt on with some very serious gun-grabbing news.
[03:58:12.214 --> 03:58:13.555]  Then Ron Paul, of course, was on.
[03:58:13.555 --> 03:58:15.537]  Jason Vermas on the Cybersecurity Act.
[03:58:15.537 --> 03:58:18.079]  And a lot more that will re-air on AM and FM's across the country.
[03:58:18.079 --> 03:58:19.580]  I want to thank all of our affiliates.
