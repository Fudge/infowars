[03:50.560 --> 03:56.880]  of everyone i was listening to local talk radio what triggered this chain of events in my mind

[04:14.160 --> 04:20.960]  it's right statutory but then i heard all these callers calling in talking about how well i was

[08:46.880 --> 08:53.600]  and to understand who controls this planet and the very destructive dangerous direction
[08:53.600 --> 08:59.200]  they are taking us in i have a big stack of news from the states and the federal government
[08:59.200 --> 09:06.240]  announcing literally scores of new taxes a day i mean i i i've got probably more than 10 articles
[09:06.240 --> 09:12.960]  here in the stack i didn't count them that are all about horrible new taxes on basically everything
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.200]  and the country's going bankrupt the people are going bankrupt and government's just growing
[09:19.200 --> 09:24.960]  growing growing growing and the republicans are positioning themselves as our saviors
[09:24.960 --> 09:28.160]  and they're going to get back in power in the next few years and then they're going to betray
[09:28.160 --> 09:32.960]  everybody and then the democrats will get back in power and the same cycle over and over again
[09:32.960 --> 09:39.760]  same thing in every other western nation there is no doubt we are sliding into bona fide tyranny
[09:40.560 --> 09:49.440]  and it is a scientific tyranny all over the western world the exact same initiatives are being
[09:49.440 --> 09:57.680]  implemented where if one of your parents was ever on welfare or ever was given a learning
[09:57.680 --> 10:04.160]  disability the cps takes your children in canada and in england and now in the united states i see
[10:04.160 --> 10:08.880]  the in the news every day they just come take your children they come take your firstborn child
[10:11.680 --> 10:15.520]  they are trying to pass laws and hundreds of cities have already done it in england
[10:17.840 --> 10:22.640]  it's the e u doing it they come in and finance the local city councils the townships because they
[10:22.640 --> 10:29.040]  can't get to parliament to pass national laws where for parents to be in public with their
[10:29.040 --> 10:33.520]  children they have to register with the government and prove they're not a sex offender that doesn't
[10:33.520 --> 10:37.120]  mean they have to prove if they were never arrested it means they have to go get a license
[10:37.120 --> 10:42.800]  to be with their children in public here in the united states and in england we see articles
[10:42.800 --> 10:50.320]  every week where someone will take their sons and daughters to a ice skating rink or to one of those
[10:50.320 --> 10:56.480]  video game arcade areas for their kids to play and they'll take a iphone shot of them and the police
[10:56.480 --> 11:04.320]  will come arrest them saying are you a pedophile it just goes on and on in my film in game this is
[11:04.320 --> 11:09.120]  three and a half years ago i put mainstream news articles in there from england where if you're
[11:09.120 --> 11:14.800]  ever had a parent who was convicted of any crime then it's eugenics they they say that means you
[11:14.800 --> 11:21.040]  have criminal genetics and at birth you're put in a criminal database and at age two you go on
[11:21.040 --> 11:28.720]  parole and start being interviewed by the social workers i mean this is a total 1984 scenario
[11:29.360 --> 11:35.680]  and here's one today from the mail the daily mail pupils age five on hate register teachers must
[11:35.680 --> 11:40.560]  log playground taunts for government database all in the name of keeping everyone safe
[11:40.560 --> 11:47.040]  if meanwhile the government can taser shoot kill beat attack whoever they want the government's
[11:47.760 --> 11:52.400]  teaches their attack dogs to be more vicious to be hateful towards the public that's all fine
[11:53.120 --> 11:56.320]  but if you yell at your wife or yell at your husband they're going to take your kids
[11:56.320 --> 11:59.600]  or if you take a photo of your child at the park they're going to try to take your kids
[12:00.400 --> 12:06.960]  or i see this every few weeks the famous arizona case last year got a lot of attention where it
[12:06.960 --> 12:16.640]  was the children in towels uh what ages two and three two girls hugging each other and they
[12:18.240 --> 12:26.240]  took their kids i saw an article a month ago where a man in highly decorated in afghanistan
[12:26.240 --> 12:37.520]  uh his wife sent him a photo of his daughter playing in a baby pool in a bikini aged three
[12:38.080 --> 12:43.200]  and they arrested him ladies and gentlemen i mean let me explain this
[12:45.680 --> 12:50.800]  it's just off the charts it's off the charts and i've seen a lot of news articles and then
[12:50.800 --> 12:53.840]  i heard local talk radio covering it this morning but saying it was a good thing
[12:53.840 --> 13:01.680]  that if you're 15 16 or 17 and you have a sweetheart in high school and you guys uh get
[13:01.680 --> 13:08.000]  in the back of the back seat of the car and have sex which is what human beings do i'm not saying
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.960]  it's a good thing uh i mean i think absences is good there's a lot of diseases out there
[13:13.760 --> 13:18.000]  there's so much abortion going on people abort these babies so i'm not saying it's a good thing
[13:18.000 --> 13:24.640]  but it is natural i mean it's normal in the pioneer days the average age people to get married was 15
[13:25.920 --> 13:33.680]  you know you're of age in israel uh when you're 13 the whole issue here is that many of our founding
[13:33.680 --> 13:39.680]  fathers were married at 15 16 17 the point is they they tell us we're children now so we're 18
[13:39.680 --> 13:44.240]  they're trying to push it up to 20 and whereas i think it is good for people to wait till they
[13:44.240 --> 13:51.600]  get married because i mean i've been down that road you know when i was in high school and college
[13:51.600 --> 13:55.440]  i was very promiscuous i mean you couldn't keep me away from the cheerleaders you couldn't keep
[13:55.440 --> 14:00.720]  them away from me i mean it looked good and it was good but the whole point is is that
[14:01.360 --> 14:07.680]  i wish now in hindsight i would have never done the things i did because overall it's
[14:07.680 --> 14:15.040]  destructive and it's bad and i learned many years later without me knowing that i had a girlfriend
[14:15.040 --> 14:20.080]  who had an abortion absolutely and and you know the way my family was the time if we would have
[14:20.080 --> 14:26.880]  known but no they kept it secret and look the issue here is it's so hypocritical and they know
[14:26.880 --> 14:33.760]  it's hypocritical that we have national statistics uh from the kaiser family foundation
[14:33.760 --> 14:43.680]  showing promiscuous behavior in boys at 53 percent and girls at 50 and i've seen some numbers
[14:44.400 --> 14:47.600]  because some of them aren't truthful and and they tend to think it's even higher than that because
[14:47.600 --> 14:52.000]  a lot of people will lie and this was a percentage of ninth and twelfth graders through ninth and
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.360]  twelfth grade who've had sexual intercourse that's not even counting other forms of sex
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.560]  a lot of the youth and studies don't don't think that oral sex is sex but it certainly is
[15:02.560 --> 15:08.960]  because and uh that's as high as 80 percent in some of the polls i've seen so half of the high
[15:08.960 --> 15:16.000]  schoolers in this country are sex offenders according to the government and they ruin their
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.720]  lives and how many cops listening out there how many of you in high school had sex more than half
[15:24.080 --> 15:27.920]  how many and the other half i bet you wish you would have you were sure trying weren't you
[15:27.920 --> 15:35.760]  i mean i remember being 13 14 and hearing you know my friends older brothers talking about
[15:35.760 --> 15:46.400]  their girlfriends and i was like this sounds awfully good i mean this is amazing ladies and
[15:46.400 --> 15:58.080]  gentlemen uh i mean when you've got two year old or 14 month old uh say german shepherds and they
[15:58.080 --> 16:05.680]  get together in the backyard and do something i mean do you send them to jail for it no well humans
[16:05.680 --> 16:12.080]  14 15 16 17 i mean all i was thinking about was girls that that's all that was ever on my mind
[16:12.080 --> 16:21.120]  sitting there in class uh it's amazing but according to this government and this system
[16:21.840 --> 16:27.920]  every and i heard these talk show hosts this guy called in and was even you know brainwashing
[16:27.920 --> 16:32.000]  saying yes i'm guilty you know i was a teenager and she was the same age and you know we got
[16:32.000 --> 16:37.200]  convicted of this and then i pulled up some articles and confirmed my memory that all over
[16:37.200 --> 16:46.400]  the country tens of thousands of cases a year now where 17 year old seniors in high school
[16:47.600 --> 16:54.480]  get caught at the park in the back of the car in the back of the truck and they go to jail
[16:55.360 --> 17:01.920]  the cops arrest them throw the book at them when those cops doing that guaranteed did the
[17:01.920 --> 17:13.120]  exact same thing so see this is what tyranny is it takes normal behavior that is natural
[17:14.080 --> 17:19.600]  and they make it a crime and then separately i see the articles every day there's one here
[17:19.600 --> 17:26.400]  in the in the statesman today and another one uh from kxan where they'll take a violent rapist
[17:26.400 --> 17:33.760]  who rapes a 16 year old girl when they're 22 or you know we see these reports constantly of some
[17:33.760 --> 17:39.520]  50 year old degenerate pedophile who who's raped a four-year-old and then they're out in five years
[17:40.160 --> 17:44.880]  so see they're letting them go the real perverts the people that are unnatural the people that
[17:44.880 --> 17:50.400]  are predators the people that are dangerous the people a lot of times that kill kids they grab
[17:50.400 --> 17:57.600]  and they let them go they let them go and that makes me very very angry and then they take
[17:58.400 --> 18:05.920]  natural activity and make it highly illegal and it gets worse and worse you know 10 years ago
[18:05.920 --> 18:11.040]  they take an 18 year old guy who was a senior and he'd have a 17 year old girlfriend you see
[18:11.040 --> 18:14.880]  you've seen all the reports of the football players getting busted and things because usually people
[18:14.880 --> 18:19.280]  are jealous of them so they report yeah and then and then the cheerleader gets pregnant the police
[18:19.280 --> 18:24.080]  come and arrest the guy instead of the family going okay you guys get married wow this is a great
[18:24.080 --> 18:30.880]  blessing better get to work boy better get into the factory and get to work now not going to be
[18:30.880 --> 18:40.240]  college for you now you got to go right to work i mean how many people how many people do you know
[18:40.240 --> 18:45.920]  who had babies in high school a lot i had a lot of friends who got married in high school because
[18:45.920 --> 18:49.840]  their families were christian and they had the baby and their business owners and happy today
[18:50.400 --> 18:55.600]  but they tell you that's bad no you got to have an abortion number one and you got to go to jail
[18:55.600 --> 19:02.720]  that's right you got to go to jail for for this i mean how many of those judges up there
[19:03.440 --> 19:11.200]  sending 16 year old men and women to prison for consensual intercourse did the exact same thing
[19:11.200 --> 19:17.120]  when they were in high school hmm then you got the feminist and all these books they write saying all

[26:59.200 --> 27:06.320]  they bring a box of spoons forks and knives to cut it up and they get arrested and then
[27:06.320 --> 27:11.840]  have to do another year of school because they then under zero tolerance strip them of their year
[27:11.840 --> 27:20.720]  oh but it gets worse you've all seen the reports of young girls young boys sent to school with
[27:20.720 --> 27:29.040]  aspirin or advil or ludens cough drops not even a drug not even over the counter ludens isn't
[27:29.040 --> 27:34.080]  even over the counter there's nothing in it but a tiny bit of menthol to make the cooler

[28:13.760 --> 28:19.920]  today anybody that wants to can just go to youtube and type in rumsfeld grilled over dinecore child
[28:19.920 --> 28:30.400]  trafficking or un caught running child sex trade and we're talking about in the millions in the
[28:30.400 --> 28:37.200]  last decade european report over one million children trafficked in europe mainly by the
[28:37.200 --> 28:42.560]  un dinecore and others because they've got the diplomatic passports diplomatic community no one
[28:42.560 --> 28:48.160]  can search the aircraft and they fly them into saudi arabia israel thailand kids from all over
[28:48.160 --> 28:53.760]  the world and rumsfeld's asked about it by congress and he says well yeah they're still
[28:53.760 --> 28:57.920]  getting contracts because you know we put them in the penalty box you know they got a fine
[28:59.920 --> 29:05.920]  and how many times do you see in the news cps workers normally the head ones and the texas
[29:05.920 --> 29:10.560]  youth commission running rape rooms and they shut down another private prison outside austin
[29:10.560 --> 29:14.240]  because they were raping every woman in the facility that was with adults
[29:14.240 --> 29:20.160]  and they're passing laws where you can't have your own gardener your own or burglar bars on your
[29:20.160 --> 29:25.920]  house or where you can't be armed because criminals run the government what would criminals do if they
[29:25.920 --> 29:32.480]  ran the government what they're doing now and there's different little teams of criminals
[29:32.480 --> 29:36.400]  in government everywhere who kick the good people out and then promote all their scum in

[33:29.760 --> 33:36.800]  in the cyber security bill ron paul and wide open phones in the last hour and a half of the
[33:36.800 --> 33:45.600]  broadcast today i'll probably open the phones up and larry frats on with us as well i mean look at
[33:45.600 --> 33:52.080]  this article this is out of england pupils age five on hate register teachers must log playground
[33:52.080 --> 33:56.880]  taunts for government database everyone's being made a spy for the government same thing happening
[33:56.880 --> 34:03.120]  here in the u.s. i mean think about it prisoners in medium security prisons are allowed to play
[34:03.120 --> 34:08.640]  basketball and dodgeball and things like that but not kids oh no that's aggressive that's bad that's
[34:08.640 --> 34:15.200]  evil training you to be totally domesticated creatures if you draw a picture of a gun in art
[34:15.200 --> 34:25.600]  class you're arrested in art class every time we were given a chance to draw whatever we wanted
[34:25.600 --> 34:30.640]  that's all the boys drew with soldiers with guns hope you're all arrested heads will be forced
[34:32.400 --> 34:37.440]  heads of schools will be forced to list children as young as five on school hate registers
[34:38.640 --> 34:45.040]  over everyday playground insults even minor incidents must be recorded as examples of serious
[34:45.040 --> 34:49.360]  bullying and details kept on the database till the pupil leaves secondary school you know it'll
[34:49.360 --> 34:55.520]  always be saved teachers are to be told that even if a primary school child uses homophobic or
[34:55.520 --> 35:01.840]  racist words without knowing their meaning simply teaching them such words are hurtful and inappropriate
[35:01.840 --> 35:07.600]  is not enough instead the incident has been recorded and his or her behavior monitored
[35:07.600 --> 35:13.360]  for future signs of hate bullying so when you put your kids in school it's for them to be
[35:13.360 --> 35:20.960]  tracked traced and be given a record of some type i mean take austin texas i've got the local newscast
[35:20.960 --> 35:24.960]  they have built little portable buildings on all the major middle schools and high schools
[35:25.520 --> 35:29.760]  where they have court every week but it's not even real court they call the kids in and say
[35:29.760 --> 35:33.840]  you've been late to class three times last month i'm charging you with truancy i will have you
[35:33.840 --> 35:39.680]  arrested right now unless you sign these agreement it's not a real court they're not told about due
[35:39.680 --> 35:43.520]  process nothing and the parents on the news shake and sign it and they go on probation
[35:44.080 --> 35:50.320]  a further justification they they agree to it and now when they screw up in any way even though
[35:50.320 --> 35:55.440]  the truancy law says that's not truancy they've got them if they do something in the next six
[35:55.440 --> 36:01.840]  months on the a further justification including being late to class now they go to jail all fraud
[36:01.840 --> 36:09.600]  all criminal totally evil going on nationwide the accusations will also be recorded in a database
[36:09.600 --> 36:14.320]  held by councils and city governments and made available to whitehall federal government and
[36:14.320 --> 36:20.000]  ministers to help them devise future anti-bullying campaigns or brainwashing the scandal the effort
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.640]  to stop children using homophobic erasic language was revealed after the parents of a 10-year-old
[36:24.640 --> 36:32.640]  primary school pupil in summer said peter dreary were told that his name would be put on a register
[36:32.640 --> 36:40.400]  and his behavior monitored while he remained at school the boy was reported after he called a
[36:40.400 --> 36:46.640]  friend a gay boy kids always say that i don't even know what it means oh that's gay this is gay
[36:47.440 --> 36:52.560]  his parents fear the record of homophobic bullying will count against him throughout his school
[36:52.560 --> 36:57.520]  career and even into adulthood well of course that's the mind control in another incident last
[36:57.520 --> 37:05.040]  year a six-year-old girl sharon goer was reported for racist bullying at her school near turnbridge
[37:05.040 --> 37:10.720]  wells in kent sharon who was chased by two 11-year-old girls one of them taunted her
[37:11.920 --> 37:17.760]  that she had chocolate on her face the six-year-old responded to one of the girls who was black
[37:17.760 --> 37:22.800]  well you've got chocolate on yours it's all selectively enforced of course everybody against
[37:22.800 --> 37:27.520]  each other it's all mind control many schools nationwide have already followed advice that
[37:27.520 --> 37:34.240]  they should record incidents of alleged racist homophobic or anti disability bullying one report
[37:34.240 --> 37:42.560]  last year by man festero club civil liberties think tank said 40 000 children each year having
[37:42.560 --> 37:54.160]  racist charges added to their school records it's called hate taunting and it goes on
[37:58.320 --> 38:05.360]  on and on if you call someone fat it's over for you this is the mind control
[38:06.080 --> 38:11.520]  and remember meanwhile all over the united states and europe they have the police come
[38:11.520 --> 38:15.040]  into public schools elementary middle school and high school unannounced
[38:16.400 --> 38:22.960]  in militia uniforms with guns firing blanks screaming we are home schoolers against public
[38:22.960 --> 38:27.680]  education we are going to kill you that was in the associated press the children urinate on
[38:27.680 --> 38:32.000]  themselves collapse teachers collapse some had to be put in psychiatric facilities that happened
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.840]  in minnesota totally screwed the one teacher up she thought they were really going to kill her
[38:35.840 --> 38:43.520]  they have in high school these weekend camp events where they then have the police come in and
[38:43.520 --> 38:49.600]  threaten to kill them it's all reeducation camps you are living in a giant reeducation camp when
[38:49.600 --> 38:54.800]  you watch television it's brainwashing you when you're in school all the diversity training it's
[38:54.800 --> 39:00.320]  all about raising the awareness about racial and sexual differences to get everyone at each

[42:34.000 --> 42:37.920]  senate climate debate and potentially open up votes that may not have been there otherwise

[44:55.200 --> 45:03.840]  planet dot com from steve watson today member two months ago caller started calling saying
[45:03.840 --> 45:08.080]  we need to take the tea parties over that we started as true constitutionalists and patriots
[45:08.080 --> 45:13.280]  from the mainline republicans that are demonizing berthers anybody else that doesn't trust obama
[45:13.280 --> 45:18.560]  now you know the republican leadership will teach us to not criticize the federal reserve and
[45:19.200 --> 45:24.960]  you're not we don't want any anti-war people in the tea parties and we're gonna we're we're gonna
[45:24.960 --> 45:31.680]  teach the opposition how to behave and then the media is going to attack oath keepers and myself
[45:31.680 --> 45:36.720]  and sheriff mac and oh we're so dangerous new york times time magazine southern bribery law center
[45:36.720 --> 45:43.280]  i mean just every day big publications attack yours truly don't let this guy run the tea parties
[45:43.280 --> 45:51.520]  i don't even go to tea parties sure my listeners are at all of them and but time magazine or was
[45:51.520 --> 45:57.360]  it news week i forget two weeks ago called me the um the profit of the tea parties
[45:57.360 --> 46:07.360]  like uh moses or something wandering around on radio wasteland but callers said we ought
[46:07.360 --> 46:12.320]  to be the coffee party to wake up the tea party well i registered some names i meant to create
[46:12.320 --> 46:20.240]  our code uh and and what a real tea party would stand for and uh it didn't happen
[46:21.760 --> 46:24.880]  that we should be nonpartisan that we should follow the bill of rights and constitution
[46:24.880 --> 46:29.680]  that we should demand government be cut and that new taxes not be levied as
[46:30.320 --> 46:35.680]  all the major fox news host are pushing for o'reilly beck it's conservative we've got to pay off
[46:35.680 --> 46:40.400]  this debt we need a value added tax and a sales tax on top of the income tax oh that's conservative
[46:42.800 --> 46:46.480]  we need to have that in the code in fact watch and just write a code of the tea parties
[46:46.480 --> 46:53.280]  you've got my mind same same view just we need to write like the 20 position points of the real
[46:53.280 --> 46:58.480]  tea party we got to get that up but because i can't do it all watson's also finally getting up the
[46:59.360 --> 47:06.880]  just got it went down the memory hole we get so busy the body scanner protest contest today but um
[47:10.080 --> 47:15.440]  we waited too long so obama has launched a coffee party to try to take over the tea parties
[47:16.080 --> 47:19.920]  and they're all over seeing an msnbc and new york times being given unlimited coverage
[47:19.920 --> 47:27.760]  to try to get all the fools that support obama to come out and demand goodies from the government
[47:28.640 --> 47:32.480]  and they're doing the same thing glenn beck did as a fake conservative there they're positioning
[47:32.480 --> 47:38.400]  themselves a lot of reasonable sounding nomenclature to get a big movement going and then bait and
[47:38.400 --> 47:45.200]  switch it even further uh the article is coffee party founder is obama campaign operative top operative
[47:45.200 --> 47:51.440]  he tried to launch his uh national compulsory service that white house science are said would
[47:51.440 --> 47:56.400]  be compulsory for everyone they tried to recruit out of the high schools they tried to get 15 million
[47:56.400 --> 48:02.480]  of their people to knock on doors only a million showed up and 13 and a half months in his
[48:02.480 --> 48:06.640]  administration and though this whole systems fell fall in a party as lowest preliminary any president
[48:06.640 --> 48:10.800]  one year in in history so now they're going to pose as grassroots with the coffee party
[48:10.800 --> 48:19.280]  no the coffee party was the idea of my listeners and hence our initiative and it does not belong
[48:19.280 --> 48:25.520]  to you so now i've been trying to spend more time at home with my family and trying to finish two
[48:25.520 --> 48:29.520]  films but that's it i'm just not going home the next few days i'm going to have to stay up here
[48:29.520 --> 48:33.360]  this weekend and get the coffee party launched and no i'm not going to organize the meetings
[48:33.360 --> 48:38.400]  and events we'll put the code up there the idea and you can do spinoffs or whatever you want for
[48:38.400 --> 48:42.960]  heaven's sakes we need to get out on the streets now and not let obama create a coffee party
[48:44.480 --> 48:46.560]  heavens this just gets worse by the minute
[48:50.080 --> 48:53.120]  build is an alternative grassroots movement to the tea party which has been
[48:54.240 --> 48:57.920]  for the most part absorbed by the mainline republicans and you know conservatives
[48:57.920 --> 49:01.600]  see we need something for true populace not republicans not democrats but for people that
[49:01.600 --> 49:08.800]  want to fight the new world order the coffee party oh yes promised to wake up potentially politically
[49:08.800 --> 49:14.880]  minded americans and offered a different avenue for the freedom movement yes it's building itself
[49:14.880 --> 49:20.160]  as the freedom movement rick perry's the freedom movement and obama's the freedom movement yeah
[49:20.160 --> 49:27.120]  they're gonna fight the new world order how sick is this and of course democrats won't wake up they'll
[49:27.120 --> 49:31.200]  go join it like idiots just like republicans have been allowed to take over the tea parties
[49:31.200 --> 49:35.600]  however the so-called founder of the coffee party has been quickly exposed in his obama campaign
[49:35.600 --> 49:41.920]  operatives whose caffeine concept was purely designed to undermine and co-op the tea party
[49:41.920 --> 49:48.640]  ideology matt i need you today to get with curt and watson and at least get the page up i need
[49:48.640 --> 49:54.080]  curt to make just a basic splash page that looks good red white and blue we need to write an
[49:54.080 --> 50:01.040]  article of why we're launching the coffee party that it was our idea to wake up the tea party
[50:01.040 --> 50:05.120]  not to be an obama thing and you know they're listening to the show and this is disgusting
[50:05.120 --> 50:10.480]  that they took my listeners ideas was it two months ago we got a bunch of calls people spontaneously
[50:10.480 --> 50:20.080]  having the idea and now this sniveling creature has hijacked it described as a documentary
[50:20.080 --> 50:24.960]  filmmaker who lives outside washington anabelle park has amassed 40 000 members via facebook
[50:24.960 --> 50:31.520]  page okay well we're starting our coffee party get me a facebook now and we need to get we have

[50:46.880 --> 50:52.160]  new york times we're a different model of civic participation but in the end we may want some
[50:52.160 --> 50:58.320]  of the same thing so now obama can't beat us so he's going to try to join us obama fighting the

[54:29.280 --> 54:35.680]  tube they've got republican operatives all over television all over print demonizing any true
[54:35.680 --> 54:44.080]  constitutionalist in the tea party like myself of keepers and others sheriff mac tom tan credo
[54:44.080 --> 54:52.000]  and uh i've told you we've seen the same talking points from glenn back and chris mathews talking
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.080]  about the tea party's violent and bad and evil and you know there's dangerous elements in it
[54:57.120 --> 55:01.920]  that are the minority when really all the polls show we're the majority just on the case of
[55:01.920 --> 55:07.760]  birthers over 50 percent of the tea party people questioned are big birthers over half of republicans
[55:07.760 --> 55:13.920]  are but vex says they're five percent so they're teamed up the republicans and democrats are teamed
[55:13.920 --> 55:18.880]  up to try to go into this big grassroots movement first they label it as the only grassroots movement
[55:18.880 --> 55:23.200]  which isn't true then they go in and take it over from the left and right paradigm playing
[55:23.200 --> 55:28.800]  against the middle like w w f wrestling and vince mcman's wife's now running for the u.s senate
[55:28.800 --> 55:37.280]  why not well nothing but wrestlers of their families uh in the government coffee party founder is
[55:37.280 --> 55:44.480]  obama campaign operative she says we're not the opposite of the tea party miss park obama operative
[55:44.480 --> 55:49.840]  41 till the new york times we're a different model of civic participation so this is obama's
[55:49.840 --> 55:54.560]  national service corps but in the end we may want some things and some of the same things
[55:54.560 --> 56:00.880]  we need to roll up our sleeves put our heads together and work it out she said that to me
[56:01.600 --> 56:12.640]  is an american way of doing things oh the slogan is wake up and stand up oh wake up obama's gonna
[56:12.640 --> 56:18.160]  save us the mission statement declares that the federal government is not the enemy of the people
[56:18.160 --> 56:25.120]  oh but the expression of our collective will so it's saying this is your government
[56:25.120 --> 56:29.040]  doesn't matter they do the opposite of what people want in every poll and that we must
[56:29.040 --> 56:34.160]  participate the democratic process in order to address the challenges we face as americans
[56:34.800 --> 56:40.160]  with the electronic voting machines at first glance this sounds like attractive stuff
[56:40.160 --> 56:44.560]  to concerned americans who are sick and tired of big government ruling over their lives
[56:44.560 --> 56:50.560]  however a quick background search on miss park reveals her real intentions and again
[56:51.120 --> 56:54.000]  the states are the way to get control of the federal government but that's what the
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.320]  republicans are trying to block running the tea parties same thing here oh no the federal
[56:58.320 --> 57:05.680]  government is you it listens to you need to work through it park campaign for obama in
[57:05.680 --> 57:11.360]  08 and was one of his organizers and operators of the influential united for obama video channel
[57:11.360 --> 57:17.840]  at youtube quote quoting her i found that people have little understanding of the
[57:17.840 --> 57:23.520]  change that senator barack obama is advocating i thought from my experience in using videos for
[57:23.520 --> 57:32.160]  civil movements that videos would be the best way to promote the need for change and for obama
[57:32.160 --> 57:38.400]  that's why i decided to work for the obama campaign anabelle park said she made over 20
[57:38.400 --> 57:45.200]  personal videos for obama campaign that drew tens of thousands of views the revelation along with
[57:45.200 --> 57:50.160]  the discovery that park is a former strategy analyst at the new york times who's now interviewing her
[57:50.960 --> 57:56.560]  explains why she received a great deal of mainstream media coverage recently oh yes
[57:56.560 --> 58:02.480]  the times the washington post both are in glowing articles on park what does that tell you in the
[58:02.480 --> 58:06.080]  last week a factor that immediately raised suspicion over her grassroots credentials
[58:06.080 --> 58:12.960]  clearly either newspapers were incapable of googling her name or taking five minutes out
[58:12.960 --> 58:16.800]  to look at her activities or they were fully aware of park's intentions and background and
[58:16.800 --> 58:21.680]  chose not to include those in the piece well of course obama's running the whole thing in addition
[58:21.680 --> 58:27.280]  parts various tweets reveal far from being open to working with a tea party activist park appears
[58:27.280 --> 58:33.680]  to have vitriolic hatred of them and then she goes on to talk about how they're dangerous scum

[1:00:05.280 --> 1:00:12.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:21.520]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:30.080]  two months ago callers to my radio show an emailer said alex start a national coffee party
[1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:36.720]  to wake up the tea parties that neocons are taking it over and we bought the website names
[1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:43.280]  i didn't build it i meant to just put up a code of what a real tea party person from my view
[1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:47.920]  should support cutting taxes smaller government controlling our borders not launching all these
[1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:53.360]  new wars you know that the oath keepers are good sheriff mac is good because now the republican
[1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:58.800]  party is coming out demonizing sheriff mac and saying oh these are extremists saying sheriffs
[1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:04.880]  need to you know run their county and that the states need to get control well now the democrats
[1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:10.240]  have been caught setting up a coffee party no doubt trying to preempt us so we're going to crack
[1:01:10.240 --> 1:01:15.600]  the whip around here and get this up and get this rolling in the next few days i'm going to cover
[1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:21.520]  more of that coming up we got ron paul in one hour we'll talk about a host of important issues
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:25.920]  with the congressman but for the next 30 minutes we're joined by larry pratt executive director
[1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:33.120]  of the only real national no compromise second amendment lobby gun owners of america and i've
[1:01:33.120 --> 1:01:38.080]  got him on about a host of issues but every few months he comes on to break down the latest attack
[1:01:38.080 --> 1:01:46.000]  strategies by the victim disarmament parasites in government and uh the dc heller case said yeah
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:50.400]  you got an individual right but we have a right to restrict it so it was really in a way bad
[1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:57.120]  this in in in new statements they haven't ruled yet but they made statements during the deliberations
[1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:03.440]  that oh yeah chicago and new york and dc can't completely not let you have guns but we do
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:09.840]  basically you have a right to turn your guns in yes you have a second amendment
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:14.880]  but we have a right to ban your guns if we want which is totally asinine so joining us is larry
[1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:19.680]  pratt larry i've seen some of the gun grabbing groups are saying they're actually happy about
[1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:24.800]  where the court's going a couple reasons i think one is that they're hoping that the
[1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:32.160]  the standard that the court will use in determining that the chicago handgun ban is unconstitutional
[1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:39.120]  and most people think they will do that uh but the standard that they uh are very possibly
[1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:44.400]  going to use would mean that you could start heading off into the wild blue yonder and making
[1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:50.960]  housing a right or health a right and of course that would be the end of freedom in this country
[1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:57.520]  as we know it and this is something that has been developing over time this wouldn't be
[1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:04.160]  new with this case the judges have been taking power into their hands for a long time that's
[1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:11.360]  not a newsflash certainly not to you and your listeners but the um the fact is they they
[1:03:11.360 --> 1:03:18.960]  they may continue in that direction and that is going to mean more gun control would be possible
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:25.600]  they'll they'll decide on a case by case basis but scalia's opinion in the dc handgun case
[1:03:26.160 --> 1:03:30.720]  made it sound like he didn't have any problem if government wanted to how law machine guns well
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:39.840]  excuse me but if there is a militia weapon of our day uh the the quintessential militia weapon
[1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:45.920]  that's it that's the one that the swiss and home with every one of their citizen army
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:52.560]  uh and here in this country we think somehow only the government should have the militia weapon
[1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:59.440]  woof that that's the kind of militia they have in cuba in venezuela had in so the union and so
[1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:05.440]  forth so uh we're uh you know it's going to be nice that you'll be able to have a handgun
[1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:11.680]  in chicago that's a likely outcome probably at least five votes in favor that maybe even six
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:18.800]  but um uh then we're going to have to continue watching what uh mr heller who got the dc gun
[1:04:18.800 --> 1:04:26.160]  ban overturn is doing he's got a suit uh already uh going after the district of columbia and their
[1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:31.440]  licensing scheme because they frankly have figured out what new york has figured out that
[1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:38.240]  you can have for practical purposes a gun ban without calling it that absolutely uh unless you
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:42.880]  make a thirty thousand dollar donation to the sheriff in uh new york you're not going to get
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:47.280]  one so only rich goldman sacks billionaires have it that was in bloomberg they're arming against
[1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:52.080]  the public the bankers have all got shimmy autos whatever they want the public's being mugged
[1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:58.000]  in the street by the hordes of vampiric homeless people running around in the drug craze stupor
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:06.400]  stay there hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our
[1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:11.920]  last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling
[1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:17.120]  the rug from underneath americans at home i've turned in members influence on our president
[1:05:17.120 --> 1:05:23.040]  in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:28.640]  as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:34.640]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:39.600]  world government tim geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[1:05:39.600 --> 1:05:44.560]  congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now
[1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:51.280]  in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic
[1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:58.400]  on dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet
[1:05:58.400 --> 1:06:06.240]  dot tv hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs generator
[1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:11.200]  now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[1:06:11.200 --> 1:06:16.640]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first
[1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:21.840]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the
[1:06:21.840 --> 1:06:28.080]  respiratory system with yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:33.520]  nano particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale
[1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:39.760]  of nano silver products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs
[1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:44.880]  generator very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided making production

[1:06:51.440 --> 1:07:00.320]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www dot silver lungs dot com
[1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:04.640]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:07:04.640 --> 1:07:09.840]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:14.720]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:20.320]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:07:20.320 --> 1:07:25.360]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:30.480]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:34.640]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[1:07:34.640 --> 1:07:40.000]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:44.400]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[1:07:44.400 --> 1:07:50.320]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com that's
[1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:55.440]  my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup
[1:07:55.440 --> 1:08:06.880]  dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:13.920]  by the way we are simulcasting at prison planet dot tv the second third and fourth hour ron paul
[1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:22.160]  coming up in the next hour going back to larry pratt of gun owners of america if you just joined
[1:08:22.160 --> 1:08:28.880]  us the supreme court a year and a half ago ruled that the second amendment is an individual right
[1:08:28.880 --> 1:08:33.600]  as if we needed them to tell us this but they had language in there about but there can be reasonable
[1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:39.680]  restraints on it and now they're saying well people have this right to life liberty in pursuit of
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:45.440]  happiness and claiming this federal power over the states whereas where i look at it should be
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:51.600]  the state's decision to their state constitutions but when that does violate the bill of rights
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:57.200]  then the the federal government and the supreme court does kick in and larry pratt's an expert
[1:08:57.200 --> 1:09:03.360]  on this so navigate this for us larry pratt and explain why are the gun grabbing groups saying
[1:09:03.360 --> 1:09:07.760]  that they're somewhat happy about some of the arguments earlier in the week by the supreme
[1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:13.120]  court pointing towards the fact that they're going to say yes you have a right to a second amendment
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:16.640]  and that means turning your guns in basically well there's nothing in this
[1:09:17.920 --> 1:09:24.720]  suit coming out of chicago that is going to jeopardize the licensing schemes of any of
[1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:31.360]  these local jurisdictions and so yes the gun ban will be gone but then the next challenge is going
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:38.240]  to be oh so you want a gun but whatever made you think that would be easy and you know there was
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:44.880]  a reporter after the dc gun ban fell went and went through the process took him six or seven
[1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:51.920]  months 750 bucks in fees and lessons that he had to take and all this kind of nonsense
[1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:59.600]  and finally got his gun but it was something that as a matter of his job he was able to do
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:06.000]  but most of us who have a nine to five and the bureaucrats probably work 930 to 430
[1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:10.880]  rots a rock getting over there and getting the papers and you know you have to take
[1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:16.720]  vacation time on top of everything else to to try to go through this gauntlet and that's the
[1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:21.760]  way they like it and they make the fees high enough that it becomes prohibitive as they do in new
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:28.560]  york it makes it it make it so complicated you you may need an attorney to navigate through the
[1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:34.160]  system so the language is again okay you do have a right but we have a right to make it
[1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:40.480]  almost impossible to get one so far that's about all that we've accomplished and you know it's
[1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:47.920]  progress that no more gun bans in dc no more probably in chicago a lot's going to hang on
[1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:55.120]  what mr heller is doing if he has a favorable outcome then he's going to be junking the
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:11:02.480]  licensing scheme in the district he's got another attorney uh because the one that
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:08.880]  went up on his case the first time actually agreed with just as stevens that there is such a thing
[1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:17.360]  as reasonable infringement which would include licensing and well that was the ball game and
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:22.720]  even scalia said you know we're not going to rule on the district of columbia's licensing law
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:31.360]  uh because that was taken off the table by council so um that that was a uh a very expensive
[1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:36.960]  decision that that attorney made and it actually i from what he said later that's what he believes
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:42.720]  he doesn't have a problem philosophically with licensing and and and going back from memory
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:48.800]  correct me if i'm wrong the uh nra came in and stuck their snout in the middle of the suit
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:54.560]  and was allowed to file briefs and they were arguing in their filing that yeah you're allowed to
[1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:59.360]  make us get licenses and make it hard to get we're just saying that if you can jump through
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:06.880]  100 flaming hoops and climb mount everest and uh if you know if pigs can fly then maybe sometime
[1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:12.400]  on a blue moon you can look at a gun i mean you know they basically agreed that yes you can restrict
[1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:20.160]  but there is sometimes a right the uh the nra for a long time has taken a position that these
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:27.360]  kinds of and had to use stevens's term reasonable infringements are acceptable they were the ones
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:34.400]  who wrote uh the instant background check law uh that was not something that uh the brady's came
[1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:40.880]  up with the nra spearheaded the 1968 gun control act it was uh when the brady law was before congress
[1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:47.680]  it was originally a waiting period and had it remain just that sheriff max lawsuit would have
[1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:53.360]  overturned that and we would have had zippo in this area but instead they moved to an instant
[1:12:53.360 --> 1:13:00.560]  registration again exactly and that supplanted the waiting period after i don't remember four or five
[1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:09.200]  years and that's what we're stuck with now uh so they they think inside a very small box and
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:15.440]  they're afraid to to push back against the system because well they don't want to make the system
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:22.000]  mad at them and that's an attitude that's a risk that's a prescription for failure every time it's
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:28.240]  it's almost identical to the way most congressmen think just want to sit there and kind of be nice
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:35.280]  and can't we all get along and and uh it's kind of fun spending all this money anyway so that's
[1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:40.400]  the business as usual attitude that we're up against and it's killing us it's now larry pratt
[1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:45.200]  executive director gunners of america gunners dot org we've got it up on screen for president planet
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:50.240]  dot tv viewers links to it up on info wars dot com for radio listeners want to go visit the sites
[1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:55.440]  and find out more and sign up for your great free alerts let's get into some other areas uh i look
[1:13:55.440 --> 1:14:04.640]  at national statistics roughly 50 50 25 years ago in polls half the public was ignorant and said oh
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:11.120]  yes let's restrict guns now i see national polls of over 70 percent and growing every year say get
[1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:16.560]  rid of all the gun laws it only empowers criminals and a corrupt government we're seeing record gun
[1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:22.080]  sales we're seeing a lot of so-called liberals buying guns and we're also seeing airsoft which
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:29.440]  shoots a plastic safe bb selling like hotcakes everywhere i mean they've got double aisles
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:34.720]  at walmart and double aisles at academy here in austin where i live every time i'm there people are
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:39.760]  just all over the airsoft aisle snatching and grabbing uh you know i've bought a bunch of these
[1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:46.080]  it's great marksmanship for your children it's air powered very safe it's a gateway for people
[1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:52.080]  into firearms who would be scared to even pick up a bb gun or then a real firearm studies show
[1:14:52.080 --> 1:14:59.120]  it's causing people to relearn to not be so scared of guns and so now all over europe all over england
[1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:04.320]  australia canada they're they're banning them and you know about the case in cornelius oregon
[1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:11.600]  we had the fellow on two days ago right they see 30 000 now they see 20 000 more totally legal replica
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:18.080]  they look real and the atf agent says on tv it looks scary i'm not going to allow you to have this
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:25.040]  and he even got the atf importation office to talk to them and tell them you don't have authority
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:31.440]  and the origan office said we don't care obama's giving us backing that's the key i i knew this
[1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:38.720]  was coming from the top as long as president hussein is in office we are going to see this
[1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:45.520]  kind of lawlessness if a bureaucrat wants to do this kind of thing he knows he will not be held
[1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:51.760]  accountable uh by the guy at the top and so we're going to see more of this i'm afraid well well
[1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:56.640]  they're claiming that they have a ruling power same way they can say a semi-auto is really full
[1:15:56.640 --> 1:16:03.600]  auto now toy guns larry i mean i mean aren't they wide open to serious lawsuits but also
[1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:09.760]  isn't it criminal to no paperwork either they've grabbed two shipments 50 000 worth and just say
[1:16:09.760 --> 1:16:14.320]  we're not talking to you we're not giving you the paperwork it's over i mean this is lawlessness
[1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:22.960]  it's about as outrageous a behavior as we've seen perhaps since weco uh these guys uh are so
[1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:28.400]  clearly thinking that they're above the law they don't have to answer the phone they don't
[1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:34.640]  they've told the company that they don't have any obligation to uh even talk to them or explain
[1:16:34.640 --> 1:16:40.400]  how the the company could make right quote unquote uh whatever it is that the what should
[1:16:40.400 --> 1:16:45.360]  brad martin do then i mean and this is the same as highway bandits robbing a stage coach at this
[1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:50.080]  point well i talked to our federal affairs guys and i said look there's a couple things that
[1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:56.720]  i'd like to see us try to do let's get the heads of the second amendment caucuses in the congress
[1:16:56.720 --> 1:17:04.160]  in the house in the senate to write some letters asking for an explanation probably get stonewall
[1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:11.760]  okay then let's start uh looking for ways to put some zeros in uh the customs budget and
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:16.960]  because the custom actually was the the doofus that got this thing started in the a t f seems to
[1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:23.920]  be running cover for them happily uh but so we can go in there and just zero out uh their
[1:17:23.920 --> 1:17:29.200]  enforcement offices in those particular cities and then those guys are out of a job i don't think
[1:17:29.200 --> 1:17:35.680]  they'll be volunteering uh to go to work well i mean what's going on where the a t f comes into
[1:17:35.680 --> 1:17:40.080]  austin it's now been confirmed and just ordered the austin police chief shut down this legal gun
[1:17:40.080 --> 1:17:45.440]  show and they did it uh by going to the landlord to the owner and just saying we're going to charge
[1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:52.640]  you or use nuisance abatement crackhouse laws on you uh this no that would have been a frivolous
[1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:58.480]  lawsuit but i can just see how the corporate attorney is thinking my job is to save my
[1:17:58.480 --> 1:18:04.880]  employer my client uh hassle and money and it's going to be a lot cheaper for him to lose this
[1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:10.080]  contract than it is to pay me to fight these jerks but isn't that the essence of racketeering
[1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:15.520]  and and government color of law tyranny hitler didn't have a law to lock up jewish businesses he
[1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:22.560]  just did it well you and i see that very clearly and again it's the lawlessness that we've come
[1:18:22.560 --> 1:18:28.160]  to expect from an administration that itself is lawless their answer i can just hear the
[1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:34.240]  president now if if we were in that Blair house on another meeting talking about things like this
[1:18:34.960 --> 1:18:39.840]  the most likely answer i would expect is a stony i won
[1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:48.400]  no words i can do anything i want because i won there are no laws that govern me um that's
[1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:54.080]  where we are in this country and there are a lot of people that actually think that way too hey he
[1:18:54.080 --> 1:19:00.400]  got elected now we can do anything we want so the idea that we're in a republic where a lot of
[1:19:00.400 --> 1:19:07.520]  things are going to be almost always off bounds off limits that we've got at least two generations
[1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:12.640]  that hasn't been taught that in their government schools well larry pratt how dangerous of a
[1:19:12.640 --> 1:19:19.360]  precedent is that they know there's not a lobby for toy guns they're using the atf that is a you
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:26.400]  know supposed uh... second amendment regulating organization to outside their jurisdiction go
[1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:31.600]  after this as a direct attack on the second amendment i mean clearly we've got to stand
[1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:37.920]  up and fight this we do and uh... i think that we have the the soldiers in the congress that once
[1:19:37.920 --> 1:19:42.560]  they become aware of this are going to want to do it uh... david kodria has written a very good
[1:19:42.560 --> 1:19:50.080]  piece in uh... uh... what is it called uh... uh... gun rights examiner on the web and he includes an

[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:12.560]  larry pratt the executive director governors of america i'm alex jones thanks for joining us
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:17.360]  listeners and viewers southern primary law centers put out a bunch of reports last month
[1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:26.080]  attacking myself michelle bachman tom tan credo larry pratt oathkeepers sheriff mac
[1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:30.800]  and with some of the things we cover a little more racy than these other groups
[1:24:31.680 --> 1:24:37.040]  but but when you start going after larry pratt and michelle bachman a very popular congresswoman
[1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:43.280]  from minnesota they're really getting desperate and every night on msnbc you don't like government
[1:24:43.280 --> 1:24:48.720]  health care your racist uh... you don't want big government your racist uh... you don't want
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:54.320]  gun control your antisemitic the i think the a d l in southern primary law center larry are really
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:24:59.920]  destroying any tiny shreds of credibility they have with anybody they are so desperate
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:06.080]  they have shown that their thought processes seem to have atrophied and pretty soon that we can
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:12.640]  just put them in some museum where we have other mummies and things like that i mean
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:19.920]  these guys are just absolutely without any arguments they uh... so that they are resorting to
[1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:25.360]  that's different that's their most polite uh... put down when you make a point that devastates
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:31.360]  their position well my position is different uh... and the other is of course uh... you're racist
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:37.600]  and as you say that you see it nightly on msnbc so if you want to see how liberals play that
[1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:43.600]  that i should say socialist watch their that's uh... you know that the advantage that i kind of
[1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:50.480]  enjoy watching msnbc because it's it's a first-hand newsletter report from the communist party
[1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:57.360]  u s so i know what the enemy is going to be doing and if i want to know what they're up to on
[1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:01.520]  uh... socializing medicine and their latest little stratagem trying to get it through the
[1:26:01.520 --> 1:26:08.160]  the congress just turn to get their talking points right there but yep uh... we've also caught them
[1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:13.200]  and curtain emma has an article about this up on info wars today you'll have five thousand ten
[1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:17.440]  thousand sometimes a hundred thousand a tea party they'll send one of their operatives in with a
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:22.560]  racist sign and they put that on the news then people search their name and find out it's one
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:28.640]  of their operatives i mean this is really desperate type activity and they're getting so upset
[1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:33.120]  that there's all these black people in hispanics and oathkeepers i mean look at the front page i
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:38.160]  mean it's it's it's incredible other side they're getting so upset that there's all these brown
[1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:44.080]  people at tea parties i mean they're they're really panicking well uh... i was just delighted
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:48.880]  when the attack came out i thought you know uh... it uh... how can it get any better than this
[1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:54.960]  when i get lumped in with michelle bachman and all these other uh... cast of characters that are
[1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:59.680]  leading the fight for freedom uh... that that was a good day and i don't know if they will
[1:26:59.680 --> 1:27:06.640]  ever understand how truly pleased and honored i am and and for them to think that they're
[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:10.560]  hurting us uh... all they're doing is as you say showing that they've
[1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:16.960]  they've lost it they really have lost it and uh... we can as they like to say we can move on now
[1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:20.640]  well here's another reason they're being discredited poll talk and it's in some of the reports
[1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:26.080]  they're putting out on a weekly basis was up on msnbc a few nights ago we played it yesterday and he
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:31.680]  said these crazy tea party people believe a world government's being formed well you've got brown
[1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:37.680]  gore herman von rumpi uh... the head of the u n van kyman in the new york times with a headline
[1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:43.440]  we can do it calling for world government calling for global carbon taxes and then poll talk gets
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:49.040]  up and says we're conspiracy theorist we believe there's carbon taxes i mean a it's like saying
[1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:54.880]  larry pratt's crazy and alec shones is crazy they say the sun comes up in the morning
[1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:57.440]  exactly it doesn't matter what you say
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:01.200]  you're not your racist and uh... they hope
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:06.000]  people might buy that but they they ought to take a look at their business model because it's not
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:12.160]  working too well and uh... who knows when they will be this year that the new york times stops
[1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:15.840]  publishing a print newspaper and maybe remains as a
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:19.440]  a little uh... vestige of its former self online
[1:28:19.440 --> 1:28:22.640]  uh... where nobody will bump into it even accidentally
[1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:26.560]  i don't know that's right if you go to alexa dot com all the web ratings
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:33.040]  new york times going down uh... the nation going all these globalist publications are going down
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:36.320]  anything that's patriotic and pro liberties exploding
[1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:40.400]  like we have rockets tied to our backs and they're just destroying themselves there
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:44.400]  they're setting themselves on fire emulating themselves in front of us
[1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:48.240]  i i did and i made one miss
[1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:52.560]  guess on what obama was like i knew he was a marxist
[1:28:52.560 --> 1:28:56.320]  before the election i knew he was a thug uh... but i
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:28:59.840]  did think he would be more of a fabian more of that turtle
[1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:04.480]  mascot of theirs moving more deliberately but instead
[1:29:04.480 --> 1:29:10.160]  he can't move fast enough to socialize everything that he can get his hands on
[1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:14.160]  and it's for the i think for the first time many people in this country now
[1:29:14.160 --> 1:29:18.880]  understand that liberalism has been a smiley face covering the
[1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:23.440]  reality of socialism and now they see it in all its
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:26.720]  ugliness and they write all these all these news
[1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:31.040]  articles implying guns illegal to create a false perception it's not working

[1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:44.880]  to break down the cyber security act later after ron paul leaves us i want to
[1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:49.200]  get into coffee party founder is obama campaign operative
[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:53.360]  now we announced two months ago and got the domains a month ago
[1:33:53.360 --> 1:33:56.000]  that i was going to launch a coffee party and i'm not going to go out and
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  organize i'm not going to go out and
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.960]  actually have rallies just to put the idea out
[1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:05.040]  break down what the coffee party should do wake up the tea party
[1:34:05.040 --> 1:34:08.800]  that it's being taken over by republicans controlled establishment
[1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:14.880]  partisanship and that the republicans are going to sell us out
[1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:18.240]  now we know obama is and now one of his operatives
[1:34:18.240 --> 1:34:21.840]  is setting this up and getting all this attention by the media to head off our
[1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:25.120]  coffee party i should have i knew i should launch this
[1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:29.280]  and it was listeners ideas a few other people since they heard about it have
[1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:31.840]  launched similar things but it's not getting media attention
[1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:34.960]  we're launching a site in the next few days we're gonna have some articles
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:39.120]  about it tomorrow and i've got to get together with
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:42.080]  watson and nemo and kind of write up 15 20 points
[1:34:42.080 --> 1:34:45.920]  of why we're doing this and what a real tea party should be
[1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:49.600]  hence the coffee party stronger than tea
[1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:56.000]  because we're in serious times um that is coming up
[1:34:57.760 --> 1:35:00.800]  there's also another piece that paul watson has
[1:35:00.800 --> 1:35:06.160]  where the mainstream media is demonizing
[1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:10.400]  anybody that questions the swine flu shot saying that that we believe that
[1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:15.440]  space alien dna no we read the package that says it
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:20.480]  can cause cancer or sterilize you or cause guillaume beret syndrome or other
[1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:23.520]  neurological disorders and it's now come out the whole
[1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:26.960]  thing was a hoax a fraud to make money that it's a dangerous vaccine
[1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:30.800]  we've had the head of the 47 member commission of the eu on a doctor
[1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:35.360]  breaking down the fraud of this and it's blown up in their face so now they're
[1:35:35.360 --> 1:35:39.120]  running government funded psas demonizing people that's coming up
[1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:43.360]  here in a few minutes but first i wanted to get into this i mean this is so
[1:35:43.360 --> 1:35:46.560]  outrageous it's a info wars dot com article
[1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:51.920]  by erin dykes and he has a larger youtube video he put together with some
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:55.040]  of the history of china's one-child policy
[1:35:55.040 --> 1:35:59.360]  and what they do to women in china the forced abortions the rest of it
[1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:03.600]  mal killed according to the u.s government 64 million people
[1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:07.440]  the chinese government says he killed more than 80 million but they're proud of
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:09.680]  it
[1:36:09.680 --> 1:36:14.480]  he broke up families he he put tens of millions of people in slave camps i mean
[1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:18.800]  this guy turned loose youth cores on the population
[1:36:18.800 --> 1:36:22.720]  in the cultural revolution and the great leap forward this guy forced tens of
[1:36:22.720 --> 1:36:26.240]  millions of farmers off their land poor farmers and killed them
[1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:30.720]  he made stalling look like a choir boy and to have seen an end talking about
[1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:34.480]  how great communism is and how great mausetong is
[1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:38.720]  that's like in my film in game we have the actual new york times article he
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:42.080]  went to ut and got it some of our researchers did
[1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:46.320]  we shoot video of us at the ut library getting the actual micro fish
[1:36:46.320 --> 1:36:50.640]  new york times him praising mausetong in 1976
[1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:54.800]  and saying how great mausetong is and how how we need that in america
[1:36:54.800 --> 1:36:57.760]  why would the some of the richest people in the world want communism
[1:36:57.760 --> 1:37:00.960]  because they take your money and they organize and run your life
[1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:05.280]  they break up the family and they give the money and power to themselves
[1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:08.400]  that's the big dirty secret here look at how our banks and government and
[1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:12.000]  corporations have moved almost all our power to china because they're the
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  globalist model of the controlled society
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:20.400]  so this article from info wars dot com titled cnn tells masses
[1:37:20.400 --> 1:37:26.400]  that communism is good for women despite china's nightmare legacy
[1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:30.640]  and so you watch the short video clever then you can read through a rundown it's
[1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:34.960]  a pretty detailed article of what's really going on in china and he's got
[1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:38.800]  some extra video clips that are more extensive than what we're about to play
[1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:44.800]  here right now but here it is cnn tells masses communism
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:48.800]  has been good for women oh yes oh women were slaves in the home
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:51.200]  no women could work in china they wanted to
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:54.560]  but in the internal government documents from britain in the us a hundred years
[1:37:54.560 --> 1:38:00.160]  ago edward bernay's and others said and it's now been declassified gloria
[1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:03.760]  steinam's admitted she was hired by the cia with miss magazine how do we tax
[1:38:03.760 --> 1:38:08.080]  women as well how do we get them in the workforce so
[1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:11.680]  we can tax people to such a high level families break up
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:17.600]  and so the state can raise children
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:24.800]  so this is where they force you to work they turn you into a slave and here's
[1:38:24.800 --> 1:38:29.040]  cnn talking about how wonderful communist china is
[1:38:29.040 --> 1:38:34.000]  how great it is and they've got little blue obama books for the school kids now
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:39.280]  like malsey tongue's little red book so let's go ahead and play a short clip of
[1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:42.640]  singing in here it is
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:46.480]  john joe lee is the president of the all china women's federation
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:49.760]  one of the top ranking women in the chinese government
[1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:53.040]  and witness to the major changes in women's status
[1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:58.800]  since the communist revolution among the first laws passed by chairman
[1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:01.840]  mouse government were statutes banning foot finding
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:05.760]  bride selling dowry polygamy and concubines
[1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:10.080]  women were invited to leave the home and join the labor force
[1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:13.760]  now spoke those famous words women hold up
[1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:18.000]  half the sky if the statistics are any indication
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:22.560]  communism has been good for women
[1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:29.120]  okay now they attach some good things for women
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:32.240]  to this piece and make it sound like mal was a great guy
[1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:37.200]  women have forced abortions they which obama supports
[1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:40.880]  uh they follow the eugenics model is why they've been
[1:39:40.880 --> 1:39:45.680]  industrialized they made agreements with the u.s government and richard nixon
[1:39:45.680 --> 1:39:48.880]  and george bush the chinese ambassador from the us
[1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:53.680]  the u.s ambassador to china to do this they launched it in 75 by 81 it was
[1:39:53.680 --> 1:39:57.120]  forced abortion one-child policy now they proposed three months ago at
[1:39:57.120 --> 1:40:03.040]  copenhagen and the un a similar system for here in the united states
[1:40:03.040 --> 1:40:06.640]  and the white house science czar and countless others in fact i'm looking for
[1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:10.080]  my eco science
[1:40:10.080 --> 1:40:13.680]  calls for sterilizing you through vaccines
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:18.720]  through poison in the water this is the type of stuff that's being pushed
[1:40:18.720 --> 1:40:21.840]  and a lot of yuppies say oh yeah there are too many people yeah but they're
[1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:25.680]  poisoning your water too 52 of black people never get
[1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:29.280]  born they get killed and the left's the ones always the
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:34.240]  the control corporate left pushing it this is so diabolical ladies and
[1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:37.680]  gentlemen that we've come to the point where malsey tongue the greatest
[1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:42.880]  mass murderer in all of recorded history no one has killed more than malsey
[1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:47.600]  tongue no one debates that is praised
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:54.240]  is praised shifting gears uh paul joseph watson wrote an article
[1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:59.840]  about the government running demonization pieces
[1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:02.800]  of in fact well you guys pull it up because for some reason i didn't couldn't
[1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:08.320]  see it in my stack i thought i printed it today
[1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:12.720]  demonizing anyone who doesn't think the vaccine is good for you
[1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:16.800]  it's kind of like those corn syrup ads you've seen all the studies show it
[1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:20.880]  links to diabetes all the studies show
[1:41:20.880 --> 1:41:27.680]  it's got mercury in it for some reason uh that's washington post more than
[1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:32.000]  or right at half of corn syrup products have mercury in it
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:35.840]  but they run an ad where the woman's the expert and the man's always an idiot
[1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:40.240]  or another neighbor woman's over and the woman explains to her she's a moron
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:45.120]  that corn syrup's wonderful why do they do that not because women are stupid
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:48.560]  why do they target women they target women because women make over 80 percent
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:52.240]  of the household purchases in all the major studies
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:55.520]  and so they know women are the ones reading the back labels notice you can't
[1:41:55.520 --> 1:41:58.560]  buy chewing gum now in any store that i've seen that doesn't have aspartame in
[1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:03.280]  it even if it's not sugar-free what is aspartame it's a genetically engineered
[1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:07.200]  ecoli bacteria that they feed toxic waste to i'm not
[1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:11.760]  kidding that then defecates a poisonous drug that is
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:16.160]  addictive that is also 61 times sweeter than sugar per gram
[1:42:16.160 --> 1:42:19.760]  oh you don't believe me just search engine the term manufacturing process
[1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:24.480]  of aspartame it is the
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:30.880]  excrement of a genetically engineered bacteria the pentagon was trying to
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:34.400]  study chemical weapons in the 60s and came up with this and they gave it to
[1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:40.160]  donald rumsfeld at surle and monsanto uh to to come out with this and i and i
[1:42:40.160 --> 1:42:43.760]  could just go on and on ladies and gentlemen it is an addictive chemical
[1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:48.480]  weapon and they know it but hey you know they run all these ads explaining
[1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:52.480]  your cooks you're crazy but they wouldn't be running these ads saying
[1:42:52.480 --> 1:42:58.000]  ecoli poop is good um they wouldn't be running ads saying mercury's good for
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:03.360]  your brain they wouldn't be running ads saying that uh
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:08.000]  all these toxic substances were good if people weren't waking up
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:11.600]  and the the federal government's dished out money to all the states to run these
[1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:15.280]  this is uh this particular clip out of kentucky there's a bunch of states
[1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:19.920]  running different variants of these and
[1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:24.000]  if you question the vaccines and think anything and it's bad you believe in
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:26.240]  space aliens and that the and that the vaccine is
[1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:32.000]  space alien genetics so we're going to go ahead and play this clip
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:35.760]  remember how during the whole swine flu freak out they would issue fact sheets
[1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:38.960]  going there's no mercury it can't sterilize you it can't hurt you
[1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:43.760]  but then the actual insert that came with the drugs says it does
[1:43:43.760 --> 1:43:49.360]  so let's go ahead and play this clip here it is
[1:43:50.800 --> 1:43:54.640]  i hear the h1n1 swine flu vaccines made from platypus milk
[1:43:54.640 --> 1:43:58.880]  no no no it was brought through a portal that only opens every 700 years
[1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:02.960]  my cousin sent me an email says it makes you susceptible to hypnotic
[1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:08.320]  suggestion some folks believe anything the swine flu vaccine is safe
[1:44:08.320 --> 1:44:12.800]  effective and you still need it learn more at kentucky's flu website
[1:44:12.800 --> 1:44:17.120]  that way you can separate the fact from the fiction it was developed from secret
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:21.280]  alien technology from the moon
[1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:28.080]  no one is saying any of that we're having medical doctors on and the head of
[1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:32.720]  the eu commission on who found that big pharma made hundreds of millions of
[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:37.200]  payoffs to regulators in the eu england the united states and
[1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:41.840]  canada that it is a dangerous vaccine that the german
[1:44:41.840 --> 1:44:44.400]  government and military wouldn't even take in fact pull that up german
[1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:48.720]  military gets additive free vaccine
[1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:59.040]  we could pull up 31 percent of homeless given bird flu vaccine die
[1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:03.520]  london telegraph i mean the people are dying and getting sick the Gardasil
[1:45:03.520 --> 1:45:07.120]  shots killing masses of people it's admitted it's killing people
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:11.360]  the anthrax shots killed tons of our troops the pentagon even found that
[1:45:11.360 --> 1:45:15.520]  nine years ago they admitted it and stopped giving it but no we're space
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:18.960]  aliens see that's all they do and they have the
[1:45:18.960 --> 1:45:21.040]  southern probably law center gets up on tv and says
[1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:24.800]  you believe in space aliens if you know you believe there's a world government
[1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:31.040]  let's bring jason bermas in here please it's now time for him to be on
[1:45:31.040 --> 1:45:35.200]  i wanted to sit back into this segment and the rest of the next segment
[1:45:35.200 --> 1:45:38.400]  to have jason just read over the bill because it seems like the mainstream
[1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:41.120]  media doesn't even know what's in the cyber security act
[1:45:41.120 --> 1:45:45.680]  then uh... ron paul uh... is uh... coming up and talk right into that
[1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:48.880]  microphone bermas thank you jason's done a lot of research on this and i meant to
[1:45:48.880 --> 1:45:51.840]  cover this yesterday but uh... jason you've got the floor in the next at the
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:54.720]  end of the segment the next segment should go over for us well thanks so much
[1:45:54.720 --> 1:45:59.200]  alex what's being set up here is not only a
[1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:04.320]  federal cyber security program but also a localized
[1:46:04.320 --> 1:46:08.560]  cyber security program and this kind of harkened back to you going to see
[1:46:08.560 --> 1:46:11.680]  world and talking about how you are going to be trained
[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:15.920]  from kindergarten up to work on these little mindless computers and surveil
[1:46:15.920 --> 1:46:19.760]  everybody and that's what this is it literally states
[1:46:19.760 --> 1:46:25.840]  that they are going to have uh... scholarships for k-12 students so
[1:46:25.840 --> 1:46:30.080]  you as a parent will get a note home for your fourth grader that tommy
[1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:33.920]  is going to be in the junior computer genius society
[1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:38.560]  and he's going to do a summer internship for the federal government
[1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:41.680]  and it says in here to get these scholarships and we all know everybody
[1:46:41.680 --> 1:46:44.080]  wants a scholarship everybody's going to need a grant
[1:46:44.080 --> 1:46:47.920]  we're going into an economic depression alex so everybody's going to clamor to
[1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:52.000]  these jobs they're going to recruit the best and brightest to run
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:55.120]  the literal slave grid they've put into place
[1:46:55.120 --> 1:46:58.400]  and what they're going to do is they're going to use front organizations
[1:46:58.400 --> 1:47:03.120]  so they're going to use foundations okay they are going to use
[1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:06.640]  the smallest of businesses in fact they're targeting
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:09.520]  businesses with less than a hundred people that they can't get under their
[1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:13.200]  thumb immediately with this bill with again funding
[1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:16.720]  and this also creates a society where if something is exposed if they are
[1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:20.800]  exposed as illegally wiretapping surveilling someone illegally
[1:47:20.800 --> 1:47:24.720]  they can localize it they can say no it's just this foundation front
[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:29.040]  it's compartmentalization all in this bill
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:31.920]  it's nightmarish and the guest you had on yesterday
[1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:35.520]  literally said he had not read this thing they're going to put the entire
[1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:40.480]  internet under the control of the FCC and NIST
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:44.080]  NIST an organization that has now covered up what really happened
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:47.760]  at world trade center one two and seven for
[1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:51.440]  over eight years alex and with Barry Jennings who was in
[1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:54.720]  building seven with the director of security and said there were bombs
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:57.280]  going off the fire department told them they saw it happen
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:48:00.560]  then he mysteriously died very quickly now they're saying they have the
[1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:02.960]  recordings of these interviews but they're not going to release them that's
[1:48:02.960 --> 1:48:06.400]  absolutely correct in fact this week somebody got the response from their
[1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:09.200]  FOIA request to get the recordings of both Michael
[1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:12.800]  Hess and Barry Jennings from NIST's own investigation
[1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:16.640]  they admitted in the documents oh these these do exist but they're exempt
[1:48:16.640 --> 1:48:20.000]  national security national security well they give out the little they don't
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.880]  actually say national security they say the little subdivisions so you have to
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:25.920]  go look up the clause but there's four separate clauses on each one they give
[1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:29.840]  this national security clause absolutely it's unbelievable to me that we put
[1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:33.840]  NIST NIST and the FCC in charge of the internet
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:37.680]  that we would allow the federal government to come in and the new FCC
[1:48:37.680 --> 1:48:39.440]  head has said they will control the internet
[1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:43.360]  oh this is full I mean we'll start going over it quickly all right
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:47.360]  so they're going to create a high level panel that shall advise the president
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:50.880]  on matters relating to national cyber security program and strategy and shall
[1:48:50.880 --> 1:48:54.560]  assess trends and developments in cyber security science research and
[1:48:54.560 --> 1:48:57.440]  development progress made in implementing the strategy
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:49:01.120]  the way to revise the strategy and at the very end they say
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:04.880]  whether societal and civil liberty concerns are adequately addressed
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:08.480]  nothing about the constitution nothing about the bill of rights
[1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:12.560]  nothing about our inherent human rights to be able to live free in our persons
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:16.080]  and properties alex instead they're going to address the
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:20.720]  societal and civil liberty concerns and make sure those concerns are
[1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:24.160]  adequately addressed folks the constitution and bill of
[1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:27.840]  rights are being ripped up and torn apart with this
[1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:32.080]  bill support of regional cyber security so they're going to get into the
[1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:35.840]  business of your counties it's not just going to be state and federal
[1:49:35.840 --> 1:49:40.160]  again they're going after every major hub all
[1:49:40.160 --> 1:49:45.840]  networks this is total control of the internet the regional centers are for
[1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:48.880]  the promotion and implementation of cyber security standards
[1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:52.160]  each center shall be affiliated with the united states based nonprofit
[1:49:52.160 --> 1:49:54.720]  institution or organization these are the front groups
[1:49:54.720 --> 1:49:58.240]  that they're going to be putting together or consortium thereof that applies
[1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:02.000]  for and is awarded financial assistance under this
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  section now they're also going to standardize all
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:10.960]  software and hardware under NIST the transfer of cyber security standards
[1:50:10.960 --> 1:50:14.160]  process technology and techniques developed in the national institute of
[1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:17.680]  standards and technology to centers and through them small
[1:50:17.680 --> 1:50:21.040]  medium sized companies throughout the united states it's everybody and you
[1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:23.920]  have to have a federally approved person in your business
[1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:26.320]  everything has to have government software running on it
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:29.120]  they're totally taking over the infrastructure of the internet
[1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:31.760]  absolutely and that's why they want the k through 12 students so that they
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:35.280]  can actually certify them while they're still in school and then recruit them
[1:50:35.280 --> 1:50:38.240]  immediately out of high school immediately all right stay there we've only
[1:50:38.240 --> 1:50:40.320]  got five minutes left before ron paul comes up
[1:50:40.320 --> 1:50:43.920]  race through the actual subsections for people this is the house version of the
[1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:47.760]  senate is even worse you got senator j rockefeller saying
[1:50:47.760 --> 1:50:50.800]  quote we would have been better off without ever inventing the internet
[1:50:50.800 --> 1:50:53.840]  they want to censor it cast sunset at the winehouse
[1:50:53.840 --> 1:50:57.440]  is calling for that as well jason bermas is our guest popping in ron paul
[1:50:57.440 --> 1:51:01.120]  coming up and your phone calls and a ton of other important news stay with us
[1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:04.640]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing

[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:11.760]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:14.560]  than silver or gold it's true seeds and i'll perform even
[1:51:14.560 --> 1:51:17.840]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[1:51:17.840 --> 1:51:20.720]  again so our friends at solutions from science
[1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:23.840]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:27.360]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[1:53:08.720 --> 1:53:11.440]  most of which we feature on ofthefield.com
[1:53:11.440 --> 1:53:15.120]  here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the
[1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:18.080]  wild food experience as a homesteader attempting to live
[1:53:18.080 --> 1:53:21.200]  sustainably i was floored by the amount of information in this book
[1:53:21.200 --> 1:53:25.120]  dear linda i would be hard pressed to express how much you have impacted my
[1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:27.280]  life i'm amazed by the wealth of the author's
[1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:29.760]  knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book
[1:53:29.760 --> 1:53:34.000]  as we see more and more gmo foods on the shelves this information is good to
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:37.040]  know i am thankful to god for you linda i can't
[1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:40.480]  say enough about this book blessings to you and your family
[1:53:40.480 --> 1:53:44.640]  the greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see
[1:53:44.640 --> 1:53:49.600]  earth bouncy everywhere folks thanks for letting us help you get back to basics
[1:53:49.600 --> 1:53:53.200]  read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com
[1:53:53.200 --> 1:53:58.160]  you can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51
[1:53:58.160 --> 1:54:02.640]  eat free to share in the secret
[1:54:06.640 --> 1:54:09.600]  this always seems to happen when ron paul's on the hill
[1:54:09.600 --> 1:54:12.400]  we were going to get 30 minutes with him we're getting 15 he's got to go to a
[1:54:12.400 --> 1:54:18.800]  vote at uh 2 15 eastern 1 15 central uh
[1:54:18.800 --> 1:54:21.760]  burma's finish up with some of the cyber security act for people that don't
[1:54:21.760 --> 1:54:24.400]  know what's in it sure i just want to go over
[1:54:24.400 --> 1:54:28.800]  how all software configuration will go
[1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:32.400]  through nist through the fcc through the department of homeland security that
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:35.520]  was absorbed by the nsa and really set up by the nsa
[1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:40.240]  as a domestic spy front for all united states citizens
[1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:46.000]  okay so now all software will have to be an established standard of computer
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:49.040]  readable language for completely specifying the configuration of software
[1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:52.640]  on computer systems widely used in federal government by government
[1:54:52.640 --> 1:54:56.800]  contractors and grantees and in the private sector owned
[1:54:56.800 --> 1:54:59.760]  critical infrastructure and of course all of the major
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:03.200]  private sector is critical infrastructure so this is
[1:55:03.200 --> 1:55:06.960]  standardized software across the board i think you're going to see the death
[1:55:06.960 --> 1:55:09.200]  of things like linux you're going to have to go
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:14.800]  uh to the war as or irc boards or the torrent sites to try
[1:55:14.800 --> 1:55:19.840]  eventually to use blacklisted software the same with hardware
[1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:25.440]  i mean it's all here alex and there will be national compliance standards for
[1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:28.480]  all software so they don't like your software
[1:55:28.480 --> 1:55:32.240]  forget about antitrust you won't be able to compete in the system because they
[1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:34.880]  won't allow it they'll just rip it off and put it
[1:55:34.880 --> 1:55:38.880]  under a microsoft or mac brand and unfortunately
[1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:42.480]  the public is going to clamor for it again this bill
[1:55:42.480 --> 1:55:47.040]  alex passed in the house with over 400 plus votes for it
[1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:50.880]  and five votes against it one of them ron paul i might add
[1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:56.320]  and when you went to the congressional page over 94 percent of the people were
[1:55:56.320 --> 1:55:59.840]  against it how is this a representation of we the
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:03.360]  people it's not international standards the director
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:06.160]  through the institute and in coordination with appropriate federal
[1:56:06.160 --> 1:56:09.760]  agencies shall be responsible for the united states representation in all
[1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:13.600]  international standards development related to cyber security so i i guess
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:17.760]  we should be like china i guess we should move towards australia style
[1:56:17.760 --> 1:56:22.000]  censored internet that's what's in here well cnn says mal's good he killed more
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:26.160]  people than anybody in history but he's good think of the outrageousness of that
[1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:30.880]  absolutely an invisible empire we cover how on the 60th anniversary of mal and
[1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:34.880]  his communist regime we decided to light up the empire state building in those
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:38.240]  communist colors because we love them so much alex
[1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:41.920]  that's disgusting but then meanwhile neocons criticized me
[1:56:41.920 --> 1:56:45.760]  for going on russia today and talking bad about communism
[1:56:45.760 --> 1:56:49.600]  when the neocons were founded by the trotsky itinerary communist
[1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:53.600]  you just can't win the communist can literally kill millions of people our
[1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:57.360]  government created the communist and the u n on record
[1:56:57.360 --> 1:57:01.520]  if they are government is a bunch of banks that people got better figure this
[1:57:01.520 --> 1:57:04.800]  out fast no right and they don't like russia because they kick the communist
[1:57:04.800 --> 1:57:08.480]  down that's true they kicked the wrought child bankers out
[1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:12.560]  on record let me just go over just a few more things of this we've dirty filthy
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:15.680]  commies out there all you neocons saying i'm a commie
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:20.560]  everybody knows you're the scum we've talked before about them regulating
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:25.120]  broadband internet in other words you're going to start paying per megabyte
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:28.480]  for per gigabyte the key there is once the government gives you free broadband
[1:57:28.480 --> 1:57:33.120]  that you pay for then the fcc says because it's broadcast they will control
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:36.880]  it and put their software that is where i'm going with this mandatory licensing
[1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:40.320]  through the fcc so after they take it over you'll have to get mandatory
[1:57:40.320 --> 1:57:44.160]  license look look i want to go to calls but since ron paul's getting cut short

[1:58:50.640 --> 1:58:53.840]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[1:58:53.840 --> 1:58:57.920]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[1:58:57.920 --> 1:59:00.400]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[1:59:00.400 --> 1:59:04.240]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:59:04.240 --> 1:59:07.440]  allows you to have it's true total government control of
[1:59:07.440 --> 1:59:10.960]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:14.640]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:17.600]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:21.440]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[1:59:21.440 --> 1:59:24.800]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[1:59:24.800 --> 1:59:28.560]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[1:59:28.560 --> 1:59:31.440]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:59:31.440 --> 1:59:34.320]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[1:59:56.160 --> 2:00:00.880]  alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:00:05.680 --> 2:00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:18.720]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now
[2:00:18.720 --> 2:00:24.000]  live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:28.480 --> 2:00:32.080]  we always look forward to our once a month visit with congressman ron paul
[2:00:32.080 --> 2:00:36.320]  he's got to go with 14 minutes i got my atomic clock to a key vote
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:40.160]  gotta be in a committee room so he's with us now i'm gonna move quickly
[2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:44.480]  first off congressman you won the straw poll at c-pack
[2:00:44.480 --> 2:00:48.640]  uh proving that most of the republicans are not warmongering neocons you got
[2:00:48.640 --> 2:00:52.480]  84 percent approval rating in texas you won by a record 80 percent in the
[2:00:52.480 --> 2:00:56.000]  primary showing that america supports what
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:59.680]  you're doing can you comment on the fact that
[2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:04.160]  uh the uh well your take on this well i was very pleased and somewhat
[2:01:04.160 --> 2:01:08.320]  surprised but it was a delight to have won that uh c-pack
[2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:13.520]  vote but you know what was interesting is uh you know the people who oppose us
[2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:16.560]  they're they're still significant if i get 32 percent of the vote
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:20.000]  that means there's a large number still complaining and they're part of the
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:23.680]  the establishment but what i thought was interesting is
[2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:26.960]  all the sour grapes that was expressed afterwards they were complaining and
[2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:29.840]  oh this is not for real you know like they did in the campaign
[2:01:29.840 --> 2:01:33.840]  but what was interesting is somebody said that you know what we need to do
[2:01:33.840 --> 2:01:38.320]  is uh for c-pack to have any credibility they have to change the way they vote
[2:01:38.320 --> 2:01:42.560]  so they made this somebody made a suggestion that nobody under 25 would be
[2:01:42.560 --> 2:01:46.720]  allowed to vote which means and you know it too that there are a lot of young
[2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:49.920]  people who are interested in what we're talking about i think that's
[2:01:49.920 --> 2:01:52.320]  fortunate you know the next generation is
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:55.600]  not later on but currently they're inheriting this mess
[2:01:55.600 --> 2:01:58.480]  so i'm delighted to talk to young people but this whole idea
[2:01:58.480 --> 2:02:02.400]  that the people who don't like us challenging the status quo well
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:05.520]  let's not let them vote next time but i i think that
[2:02:05.520 --> 2:02:09.040]  uh there's a lot of people are coming our way every year and you know in the
[2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:12.160]  last two or three years that there's been tremendous growth in our
[2:02:12.160 --> 2:02:15.680]  movement and that makes me very encouraged
[2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:19.520]  absolutely i want to cut to the chase here uh and
[2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:23.440]  before we get into the banking situation a few months ago we were speaking at a
[2:02:23.440 --> 2:02:26.480]  campaign for liberty event and you threw the gauntlet down
[2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:30.560]  as you did back in the 80s and some videos i've seen you said we've had a cia
[2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:35.120]  coup in america they're bringing in the drugs most people don't know in 96
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:39.520]  the cia inspector general before congress admitted that
[2:02:39.520 --> 2:02:42.800]  but it's wider than that we know wall street in the banking cartel
[2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:47.280]  the federal reserve system through yale and other outfits set up the os s and
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:50.960]  cia and you came right out and basically said this is our illegitimate
[2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:54.960]  government and that ties into the banks engineering the financial collapse now
[2:02:54.960 --> 2:02:56.800]  saying they're getting ready for an even bigger
[2:02:56.800 --> 2:03:00.400]  collapse sometime this year in a constitution of the world
[2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:05.360]  run by the banks as gordon brown and others called for can you specifically
[2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:10.960]  speak to who runs the coup who they are and how we remove them because by
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:13.920]  openly coming out and really telling it like it is we can
[2:03:13.920 --> 2:03:18.000]  we can cut to the chase well i have trouble naming names because i don't
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:21.600]  know all the names but the one thing i can verify
[2:03:21.600 --> 2:03:25.040]  is that people who should have responsibility for our national
[2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:29.360]  security intelligence gathering uh the u.s congress they have
[2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:33.280]  no idea what's going on and that's the real problem
[2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:38.400]  and uh it it fits together you know the secrecy of the
[2:03:38.400 --> 2:03:42.400]  of the uh cia as well as the secrecy of the fed they control the money and they
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:45.760]  control secret government people have referred to the cia as a secret
[2:03:45.760 --> 2:03:48.800]  army for the president but sometimes i wonder whether the
[2:03:48.800 --> 2:03:54.160]  president even have total control of the cia as well as many stories have
[2:03:54.160 --> 2:03:59.200]  been written about that so it's um it's something that uh i think the
[2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:02.960]  american people have to realize uh we do know there's been evidence
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:08.400]  uh you know brought forth that the uh cia actually can own banks and uh
[2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:12.800]  there's been fairly strong evidence that uh cia's been involved in drug
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:15.200]  dealing as you know there are times when i think
[2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:18.960]  the war in afghanistan we say it has to do with pipes and oil
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:23.200]  a gas pipeline and oil and and other commercial things
[2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:27.600]  but there are the other commercial thing maybe the drug trade maybe uh
[2:04:27.600 --> 2:04:31.760]  maybe the cia's in competition with the drug dealers over there
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:35.920]  because there's a lot of self financing in these uh organization
[2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:40.080]  but i i don't take the position that i know all those answers
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:45.040]  and i don't know everything that the fed does but the one that my approach is
[2:04:45.040 --> 2:04:49.760]  that we people the people deserve and the congress has a responsibility to
[2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:53.760]  find out what they're doing and if they're not doing it fine and
[2:04:53.760 --> 2:04:57.280]  dandy will clear the air but if they are doing it it will give us more
[2:04:57.280 --> 2:05:00.560]  ammunition for the reason why we need a different monetary system and we need
[2:05:00.560 --> 2:05:03.760]  to have a different system of collecting intelligence because
[2:05:03.760 --> 2:05:08.480]  they can tell us anything remember how we went to war in iraq the cia was very
[2:05:08.480 --> 2:05:11.840]  much involved up there in the cia oh they have
[2:05:11.840 --> 2:05:15.760]  new weapons of mass destruction they're about to attack us
[2:05:15.760 --> 2:05:20.640]  and it was based on false information and this is this is what disturbs me
[2:05:20.640 --> 2:05:24.160]  the most and that's why i want much much more
[2:05:24.160 --> 2:05:27.520]  uh you know transparency of what our government is doing
[2:05:27.520 --> 2:05:31.200]  well those were strong statements you made a few months ago and you just echoed
[2:05:31.200 --> 2:05:34.160]  them but but but specifically congress as you
[2:05:34.160 --> 2:05:38.080]  know has had hearings in the 70s about the shadow government continuity of
[2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:40.880]  government uh the homeland security committee in the
[2:05:40.880 --> 2:05:45.280]  house has not been allowed to see the full text of pdd 51
[2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:49.280]  we know we've seen a 12 fold in the last eight year increase in opium out of
[2:05:49.280 --> 2:05:53.280]  afghanistan we know that two years ago a cia aircraft
[2:05:53.280 --> 2:05:56.960]  that had been used for torture flights crashed in mexico with pure
[2:05:56.960 --> 2:06:01.840]  cocaine three and a half tons meaning coming directly from the source uncut
[2:06:01.840 --> 2:06:05.760]  uh i mean this is just comes out in minna arkansas
[2:06:05.760 --> 2:06:11.760]  over and over again and so when you talk about a coup over america
[2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:15.440]  how do we ever ferret this out and remove it i mean do we start
[2:06:15.440 --> 2:06:19.200]  as you've been calling for an audit of the private fellow reserve yeah it
[2:06:19.200 --> 2:06:22.800]  won't happen until the people become really outraged they are
[2:06:22.800 --> 2:06:26.240]  growing in their outrage but it has to translate into
[2:06:26.240 --> 2:06:30.480]  different ideas and different respect for the constitution different people up
[2:06:30.480 --> 2:06:33.280]  here and we're in the midst of this transition and
[2:06:33.280 --> 2:06:36.720]  as the crisis worsened you know the real challenge is as well
[2:06:36.720 --> 2:06:40.240]  will we end up with a dictatorship or are we going to have people who are
[2:06:40.240 --> 2:06:44.320]  demanding you know a republic and open government and uh
[2:06:44.320 --> 2:06:48.080]  and that might take another 10 15 years to determine but in the midst of a
[2:06:48.080 --> 2:06:51.040]  crisis it's the worst time to present our views so
[2:06:51.040 --> 2:06:56.000]  that's why uh we we have to do our best to get as many people to agree with us
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:59.920]  as possible so that in the rebuilding that we have some ideas about
[2:06:59.920 --> 2:07:03.440]  what the monetary system should be like and what our foreign policy ought to be
[2:07:03.440 --> 2:07:06.720]  like which means that if we had a proper foreign policy the
[2:07:06.720 --> 2:07:12.640]  uh the incentive to have this uh cia excuse making excuses for knowing
[2:07:12.640 --> 2:07:15.120]  everything about us and everything is going on in the world
[2:07:15.120 --> 2:07:18.160]  that would all change and they would i don't believe that we shouldn't have
[2:07:18.160 --> 2:07:22.400]  some intelligence gathering but i don't like these clandestine
[2:07:22.400 --> 2:07:27.360]  operations and killings and things that they've we've known to have to happen
[2:07:27.360 --> 2:07:31.200]  well dovetailing with that uh you grilled Bernackie
[2:07:31.200 --> 2:07:34.960]  a few days ago and then the chairman for those that haven't seen the video it's
[2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:38.080]  up on prisonplanet.com Frank agreed with you and said we need an
[2:07:38.080 --> 2:07:42.400]  investigation of uh the admitted and i went and pulled
[2:07:42.400 --> 2:07:45.360]  the articles up you know uh because Bernackie was acting
[2:07:45.360 --> 2:07:47.840]  like it was preposterous but it's on record
[2:07:47.840 --> 2:07:53.200]  that bcci and the federal reserve it's on record in 2004 and five tens of
[2:07:53.200 --> 2:07:57.280]  billions of dollars from the federal reserve shipped on palates into iraq
[2:07:57.280 --> 2:08:01.680]  it's on record associated press that tens of billions of drug money has been
[2:08:01.680 --> 2:08:05.200]  found in the federal reserve bank of dallas that was in
[2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:09.440]  2000 that was in the ap and then Bernackie just laughs at you and says it
[2:08:09.440 --> 2:08:11.920]  doesn't exist it's like potok from the southern
[2:08:11.920 --> 2:08:15.680]  poverty law center laughing and saying these tea party cooks believe in a
[2:08:15.680 --> 2:08:19.280]  world government when you've got every global leader calling for global
[2:08:19.280 --> 2:08:21.760]  government the imf calling for a new world order
[2:08:21.760 --> 2:08:24.720]  herman von rompy ban chi moon calling for it
[2:08:24.720 --> 2:08:27.840]  i mean i think they're really destroying what credibility they had left by
[2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:31.040]  stonewalling us can you speak specifically
[2:08:31.040 --> 2:08:35.200]  uh to uh congressional investigation separate from an audit
[2:08:35.200 --> 2:08:39.760]  just directly on uh you know is the federal reserve involved
[2:08:39.760 --> 2:08:42.880]  in greece well we know they gave the money to goldman sacks and we know they
[2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:46.720]  are involved right now and he used the word bizarre so he
[2:08:46.720 --> 2:08:50.480]  was accusing me of being bizarre which means anybody who agrees
[2:08:50.480 --> 2:08:54.240]  with my concerns uh are considered bizarre as well
[2:08:54.240 --> 2:08:58.320]  and you're right in commenting about what barney frank said at the end
[2:08:58.320 --> 2:09:01.440]  at the end of my questioning that we should look into it
[2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:07.600]  and to his credit he has sent a letter uh to the chairman uh Bernanke and carbon
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:12.240]  copied me and he's insisting that uh it's it's that the
[2:09:12.240 --> 2:09:16.880]  federal reserve respond to my charges look into it he asked
[2:09:16.880 --> 2:09:21.280]  Bernanke to contact my office to go over the details
[2:09:21.280 --> 2:09:26.400]  of the concerns that i've had and uh and and then report back
[2:09:26.400 --> 2:09:29.200]  so barney frank did follow up with a interestingly
[2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:33.040]  uh barney frank was involved with henry gonzalez and you know that henry
[2:09:33.040 --> 2:09:37.520]  gonzalez was against the uh federal reserve and demanded these uh
[2:09:37.520 --> 2:09:41.120]  investigations and the gentleman that wrote the book uh from the university
[2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:44.800]  of texas he he worked with gonzalez and this is
[2:09:44.800 --> 2:09:49.280]  so he has first hand information to call this bizarre and it's off the wall
[2:09:49.280 --> 2:09:56.160]  uh arbok was in the in the trade in uh in the federal reserve and the congress
[2:09:56.160 --> 2:10:00.640]  on the banking committee for 17 years and was involved in these investigations
[2:10:00.640 --> 2:10:05.200]  into just right as often say this is i've never heard it so you know when he
[2:10:05.200 --> 2:10:10.240]  said that sort of reminded me of about uh uh you know the debates
[2:10:10.240 --> 2:10:15.440]  uh when uh the mayor you know shouted and i can't
[2:10:15.440 --> 2:10:19.680]  believe this stuff and you know what are you saying
[2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:22.800]  it's incredible uh we've only got four minutes left with congressman ron paul
[2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:27.040]  we appreciate him joining us live today the new york times is reporting they
[2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:32.320]  may try to revive the carbon tax with the direct tax on fuel at the
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:36.160]  refinery senate trio hopes to hit pay dirt with carbon
[2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:40.960]  fee at the oil company's request uh where is the carbon
[2:10:40.960 --> 2:10:45.360]  tax going as well as health care well i don't it's hard for me to believe
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:49.360]  they'll do that even though that it's alive and they want to and that's
[2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:52.720]  their goal and they will if they can but under these
[2:10:52.720 --> 2:10:57.360]  conditions so bad of an idea it just blows my mind to think
[2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:00.960]  that they'll pursue that so i don't know the the details on
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:04.080]  whether that's going to go through or not but i can guarantee you there's
[2:11:04.080 --> 2:11:08.240]  plenty up here who still believe in it and will pursue it but i hope they come
[2:11:08.240 --> 2:11:11.840]  to their senses and and realize how detrimental it would be
[2:11:11.840 --> 2:11:15.840]  there's a mary landrew quote in here saying we need to pass this this is
[2:11:15.840 --> 2:11:19.680]  going to help americans i mean how bizarre more taxes people are
[2:11:19.680 --> 2:11:23.200]  going bankrupt uh in closing uh congressman
[2:11:23.200 --> 2:11:27.680]  we've now discovered that an obama campaign operative has founded a coffee
[2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:29.920]  party i actually had this idea with listeners two
[2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:32.800]  months ago to get real constitutional is to take
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:38.160]  the tea parties back from the neocons uh now it turns out obama picked up this
[2:11:38.160 --> 2:11:41.840]  idea and that his campaign operatives
[2:11:41.840 --> 2:11:45.360]  are now getting all this media attention to tell us to love our federal
[2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:47.600]  government that it's our federal government
[2:11:47.600 --> 2:11:52.000]  i mean that shows how powerful the tea parties are if not just the republican
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:56.080]  establishment but now the democrats are flooding in
[2:11:56.080 --> 2:12:01.920]  trying to pose as patriots yeah yeah they want us to love the government how
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:05.600]  about loving our country and understanding what freedom is all about
[2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:09.040]  but uh the battle is out there i mean one thing is is they're starting to
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:12.080]  recognize that the battle may be outside of the conventional wisdom of
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:14.480]  republicans and democrats that run washington
[2:12:14.480 --> 2:12:18.480]  and actually the discussion going on in the independent tea party
[2:12:18.480 --> 2:12:21.840]  type movement and if there's no reason to think that
[2:12:21.840 --> 2:12:25.360]  everybody is going to believe the right thing and get together and do the right
[2:12:25.360 --> 2:12:29.840]  thing in those who have who are objecting but anybody who's involved
[2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:33.840]  better realize that uh if a significant movement uh
[2:12:33.840 --> 2:12:37.440]  you know erupts like the tea party movement there will be plenty left and
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:39.760]  right and everybody else who has a special interest
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:43.520]  will want to get in and try to control it well to see the establishment trying
[2:12:43.520 --> 2:12:46.240]  to pose as anti-establishment is truly sickening but
[2:12:46.240 --> 2:12:48.880]  but i mean look at your 84 percent approval rating people know the real
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:53.280]  mccoy one minute left the economy a lot of top economists are now agreeing with
[2:12:53.280 --> 2:12:55.760]  you and others that we may have a mega depression
[2:12:55.760 --> 2:12:59.520]  in the next 16 months and they're positioning the imf and world bank with
[2:12:59.520 --> 2:13:03.360]  a new global constitution where they will pose as saviors again
[2:13:03.360 --> 2:13:08.240]  how concerned are you that that that that this recession could get a lot worse
[2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:11.200]  well i i think it is going to get a lot worse and uh
[2:13:11.200 --> 2:13:14.880]  and and what is happening now is wall streets recovered and a few companies
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:17.200]  have recovered but the unemployment rate is
[2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:22.080]  is still very high and and getting worse and there will be plans i'm sure
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:24.800]  they've been talking about it for quite a few years because those
[2:13:24.800 --> 2:13:28.560]  who run the international banking system know that they're
[2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:32.320]  in trouble so they are laying plans uh uh for this
[2:13:32.320 --> 2:13:35.440]  but people do ask me about well do you think this will be on
[2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:39.920]  bring uh bring on the uh north american union and uh
[2:13:39.920 --> 2:13:43.440]  uh you know north american currency and i really don't think so i think the
[2:13:43.440 --> 2:13:47.200]  bigger concern should be a worldwide currency and the imf and the united
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:51.280]  nations grab and hold and try and to dictate to us but we have economic
[2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:55.840]  laws on our side because uh you know you can propose these things and even if
[2:13:55.840 --> 2:14:00.560]  it does serve the special interest if it violates economic law it won't work so
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:04.400]  they can't maintain a good currency and that's why i think the european union
[2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:08.080]  is very very fragile not only the euro but the union as well
[2:14:08.080 --> 2:14:12.080]  because it's artificial and i think that's what would happen on a on a world
[2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:16.560]  government and a world currency but in the meantime it could be get
[2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:19.840]  it could get pretty messy and they're going to work very hard
[2:14:19.840 --> 2:14:24.000]  uh to get organized which means they'll work hard to undermine our personal
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:26.880]  liberties congressman we're going to let you go in closing
[2:14:26.880 --> 2:14:30.720]  i just want to say no one in congress that i've ever studied works as hard as
[2:14:30.720 --> 2:14:33.920]  you does as much media writes as much legislation
[2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:37.280]  you are a champion god bless you thank you very much gotta go
[2:14:37.280 --> 2:14:41.360]  take care there he goes to run to his vote absolutely amazing
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:14:44.800]  i mean that guy is on tv about ten times a day does about
[2:14:44.800 --> 2:14:48.640]  ten radio interviews i've talked to his press people folks i do four hours a
[2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:52.560]  day and do two or three interviews a day and i'm constantly turning them down
[2:14:52.560 --> 2:14:56.320]  because at 36 years old
[2:14:56.320 --> 2:15:03.680]  i mean i'm exhausted and that guy's 74 years old and
[2:15:03.680 --> 2:15:07.440]  just works so hard and i'm just honored that i've been interviewing him since
[2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:13.120]  1996 and that he has never changed never flip
[2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:16.560]  flopped they just he's absolutely amazing congressman
[2:15:16.560 --> 2:15:21.440]  ron paul 80 percent of the vote in the texas primary
[2:15:21.440 --> 2:15:25.120]  unheard of 84 percent approval rating and polls
[2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:31.280]  ron paul but oh he's a cook he's a you know it's outrageous at the fellow
[2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:35.040]  reserves involved in bailouts or money laundering and
[2:15:35.040 --> 2:15:38.000]  vernacular get up there and say we've made all the money public and then they
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:40.560]  say okay make this public well we're not going to make that public
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:44.560]  they think viewers on tv are so stupid they get up in front of the congress
[2:15:44.560 --> 2:15:48.400]  and lie in front of everyone unbelievable
[2:15:48.400 --> 2:15:52.160]  um

[2:16:37.120 --> 2:16:39.440]  phones up and get into a ton of other news i haven't even scratched the
[2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:43.680]  surface on yet but but again no one has read this that i've seen
[2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:47.200]  except paul watson steve watson curtain mo you and myself we've all written
[2:16:47.200 --> 2:16:51.440]  articles broken it down the last month but no one else seems to be getting
[2:16:51.440 --> 2:16:55.280]  just how evil this is so go through it jason bermas cyber
[2:16:55.280 --> 2:16:58.400]  security act and then we're going to open the phones up for first time
[2:16:58.400 --> 2:17:07.600]  callers today at 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 jason bermas
[2:17:07.600 --> 2:17:11.680]  all right let's just take it from the top on the cyber security act that did
[2:17:11.680 --> 2:17:15.680]  pass the house section one what is this thing
[2:17:15.680 --> 2:17:20.080]  what is the overview well first of all they're going to create a cyber security
[2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:24.480]  advisory panel so the site the office of cyber security is already going to be a
[2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:27.680]  new bureaucracy and then they will pick bureaucrats that are
[2:17:27.680 --> 2:17:31.920]  allegiance to globalist world dictatorships
[2:17:31.920 --> 2:17:38.560]  as their board real-time cyber security dashboard now what that means
[2:17:38.560 --> 2:17:43.440]  is they will have a grid for all cctv cameras whether they be in the private
[2:17:43.440 --> 2:17:46.800]  sector or the government sector so it won't just be the cctv
[2:17:46.800 --> 2:17:50.880]  cameras that are outside of the federal reserve building in dc which is not a
[2:17:50.880 --> 2:17:54.720]  government organization or the ones outside the halls of congress or the
[2:17:54.720 --> 2:17:57.200]  white house or the ones that are supposedly
[2:17:57.200 --> 2:17:59.920]  protecting us in the subways of new york city
[2:17:59.920 --> 2:18:02.880]  we're talking about a system that can tap into
[2:18:02.880 --> 2:18:10.480]  in real time in real time all cctv cameras across the country
[2:18:10.480 --> 2:18:14.160]  state and regional cyber security enhancement program
[2:18:14.160 --> 2:18:17.920]  this again is to ensure that the local officials
[2:18:17.920 --> 2:18:22.320]  such as your sheriff your state senator your congressional representative are
[2:18:22.320 --> 2:18:25.760]  under their thumb and remember they're going after
[2:18:25.760 --> 2:18:29.680]  all infrastructure they say all the important infrastructure and then they
[2:18:29.680 --> 2:18:32.800]  reveal themselves in the bill that they'll be giving grants
[2:18:32.800 --> 2:18:36.560]  to businesses of a hundred people or less that's
[2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:42.240]  everybody all infrastructures nist standards of development and
[2:18:42.240 --> 2:18:46.720]  compliance you will comply with the criminal organization
[2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:51.280]  that the national institute of standards and technologies has proven itself
[2:18:51.280 --> 2:18:57.920]  to be again nist is behind the cover-up of what happened at world trade center
[2:18:57.920 --> 2:19:06.000]  one two and seven eight plus years later yeah let's give more power to nist
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:10.960]  secure domain name addressing system this is to ensure
[2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:14.800]  that all the major universities and all the major corporations
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:18.320]  are giving out domain names but it gets worse than that because when you put the
[2:19:18.320 --> 2:19:25.280]  FCC in control of the internet and you create a mandatory licensing system
[2:19:25.280 --> 2:19:28.640]  they get to say you know what we don't like info wars.com

[2:25:01.920 --> 2:25:05.360]  then they're able again if they get caught doing something bad they just
[2:25:05.360 --> 2:25:09.200]  blame that one organization it's all compartmentalized
[2:25:09.200 --> 2:25:12.960]  interest groups and advocacy organizations
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:16.320]  they're literally telling you that the special interest groups

[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:51.840]  little snitches in the mayor's office in the
[2:25:51.840 --> 2:25:55.440]  sheriff's department in the state troopers barracks
[2:25:55.440 --> 2:26:01.200]  to rat anybody out who dare question our industrialist leaders
[2:26:01.200 --> 2:26:05.520]  on this panel this bill is nightmarish
[2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:09.040]  what are the duties of this panel the panel shall advise the president

[2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:26.000]  and they tell you how they're going to get the grid in place they're going to
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:29.840]  recruit your children through scholarships
[2:26:29.840 --> 2:26:32.960]  and for these scholarships they will have to do summer
[2:26:32.960 --> 2:26:37.280]  internship programs for the federal government
[2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:42.080]  and they later state that all software all software will have to be approved
[2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:46.240]  by nist if you want to be an it person you will have to be certified by the
[2:26:46.240 --> 2:26:50.880]  federal government folks i work it on the side every once in a while
[2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:55.360]  i can assure you i am not uh endorsed by the federal government i can still
[2:26:55.360 --> 2:26:58.480]  take apart a computer okay i can still fix one
[2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:02.800]  i can put in a hard drive i can fix some motherboard i can put some ram in
[2:27:02.800 --> 2:27:06.560]  is that bad will i not allow be allowed to do this unless the federal government
[2:27:06.560 --> 2:27:10.560]  deems it so like he's a fake contractor he does
[2:27:10.560 --> 2:27:14.560]  he's not federal is certified and there'll be plenty of people who are
[2:27:14.560 --> 2:27:18.000]  certified again because they are recruiting the youngest
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  the most impressionable the brightest minds out there
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:25.040]  k through 12 alex has talked about in the past

[2:33:11.840 --> 2:33:15.760]  moment but now just without breaking it down too much
[2:33:15.760 --> 2:33:19.280]  go through some of the other subsections in the bill
[2:33:19.280 --> 2:33:22.880]  all right i want to go through the software standardization
[2:33:22.880 --> 2:33:26.320]  right here because again all software will have to go through the cyber
[2:33:26.320 --> 2:33:30.960]  security panel that again is industrialist globalist
[2:33:30.960 --> 2:33:34.480]  nobody who's actually elected all appointed
[2:33:34.480 --> 2:33:38.320]  let's like the spp north american union private corporations and secret
[2:33:38.320 --> 2:33:41.600]  meetings set it all up absolutely corporate global government it now
[2:33:41.600 --> 2:33:44.960]  they're openly saying a bank of the world constitution running the whole
[2:33:44.960 --> 2:33:47.600]  planet with carbon taxes and for those that don't believe me let me just read
[2:33:47.600 --> 2:33:50.800]  that subsection again this is section three subsection
[2:33:50.800 --> 2:33:55.920]  one shall appoint as members appoint as members of that panel representatives
[2:33:55.920 --> 2:33:59.200]  of industry academic non-profit organizations again
[2:33:59.200 --> 2:34:03.200]  that they will fund okay interest groups and advocacy organizations the very
[2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:06.720]  special interest groups that control congress in the senate
[2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:10.160]  and state and local governments who are qualified to provide advice and
[2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:13.040]  information on cyber security so they'll go to the lowest levels
[2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:16.880]  as well because they are also setting up regional cyber security but the biggest
[2:34:16.880 --> 2:34:20.480]  subsection in there is where they go down to it companies that have a hundred
[2:34:20.480 --> 2:34:24.160]  or more customers and they have to put their software in and be run by the
[2:34:24.160 --> 2:34:26.880]  federal government i mean this is just totally taking over everything
[2:34:26.880 --> 2:34:32.080]  absolutely and then again when the FCC takes over with their national broadband
[2:34:32.080 --> 2:34:35.200]  plan right here in section six subsection two
[2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:39.280]  will all need mandatory licensing beginning in the next three years to be
[2:34:39.280 --> 2:34:41.440]  on the internet i wonder if they're going to allow
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:45.040]  inner info wars dot com and prison plan well that's what the new york times in
[2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:47.760]  the white house and all of them called for his internet licensing to even get
[2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:51.280]  online absolutely as they train your children
[2:34:51.280 --> 2:34:56.720]  as they go through and k through 12 students for participation in summer
[2:34:56.720 --> 2:35:00.400]  work and internship programs why would a kindergartner
[2:35:00.400 --> 2:35:03.360]  be in a summer program with the federal government
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:06.960]  it's absolutely obscene it's absolutely absurd
[2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:10.240]  but they want the best in price they want to control it top
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:15.200]  to bottom the top of course being the appointed members of industry of the
[2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:18.320]  banks of the special interest groups and then at the very
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:22.320]  bottom the slave class children that will be trained
[2:35:22.320 --> 2:35:26.720]  to run this grid and let's not forget these are just now they're shifting the
[2:35:26.720 --> 2:35:31.040]  economy over where there's billions of dollars of funding a year
[2:35:31.040 --> 2:35:33.840]  literally designing and engineering our economy
[2:35:33.840 --> 2:35:37.200]  uh... where that's the job people can get that's the scholarships they can get
[2:35:37.200 --> 2:35:41.280]  and you predicted this back in 2003 or 2002 i can't remember the video but if
[2:35:41.280 --> 2:35:43.600]  you can find the alex jones seaworld video
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:46.960]  he literally goes in the back room and starts typing on the computers and
[2:35:46.960 --> 2:35:49.760]  telling people that's how it's going to be you're going to be trained to sit at
[2:35:49.760 --> 2:35:52.720]  your desk and watch a computer and tattle tail on people know they said
[2:35:52.720 --> 2:35:56.960]  that that's why i knew yeah they said the jobs will be watching each
[2:35:56.960 --> 2:36:00.800]  other and that's what this bill is about and it's not
[2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:03.920]  just about the united states international standards and we know
[2:36:03.920 --> 2:36:07.680]  how the internet well last year they had control of the internet alone
[2:36:07.680 --> 2:36:12.160]  domain system and address system to the u n yeah that's right i forget what the
[2:36:12.160 --> 2:36:15.120]  organization i can that's right i can they they threw a big
[2:36:15.120 --> 2:36:19.280]  fit about that but then national media says don't worry just uh...
[2:36:19.280 --> 2:36:25.440]  drink your mercury uh... laced water all right hit the last points
[2:36:25.440 --> 2:36:29.120]  again the government is taking over the entire internet they're putting it under
[2:36:29.120 --> 2:36:33.280]  fcc and nist control nist will tell you
[2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:37.200]  how the software can be configured they will tell you what you can run on your
[2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:41.920]  computers this is for private sector private sector public sector in the
[2:36:41.920 --> 2:36:46.160]  smallest regions in the smallest of towns they're going
[2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:51.520]  after you it says so in this bill think about that why would they need
[2:36:51.520 --> 2:36:53.760]  rigid regional cyber security why would they need
[2:36:53.760 --> 2:36:58.160]  to go after organizations with less than a hundred employee why is the critical
[2:36:58.160 --> 2:37:02.480]  infrastructure also privatized why is the fcc stepping in
[2:37:02.480 --> 2:37:05.680]  again the internet is the last fashion of freedom and the fcc has ruined
[2:37:05.680 --> 2:37:09.760]  television they've ruined regular radio and they will ruin the internet
[2:37:09.760 --> 2:37:12.720]  this is it alex i think
[2:37:12.720 --> 2:37:16.640]  i pray to god that this bill a doesn't get worse in the senate and b passed the
[2:37:16.640 --> 2:37:20.400]  senate people need to wake up because my liberal friends sit there and they
[2:37:20.400 --> 2:37:24.240]  nitty and say all we need cyber security and
[2:37:24.240 --> 2:37:28.160]  it's all in the program we have michael share talk and others on cnn
[2:37:28.160 --> 2:37:31.600]  with this big cyber security act where they literally say
[2:37:31.600 --> 2:37:34.960]  at one point the national guard is coming in for martial law
[2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:38.400]  and if the governors don't like that's under federal control too bad and then
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:40.960]  they laughed about it they're like too bad
[2:37:40.960 --> 2:37:44.080]  literally talking about well that's because the banks are coming in with
[2:37:44.080 --> 2:37:47.760]  their swindle takeover and they've got to suppress free speech so they can get
[2:37:47.760 --> 2:37:50.880]  away with all the crimes they're committing it's like the atf shutting
[2:37:50.880 --> 2:37:56.000]  down gun shows without a law uh... rating toy stores and taking their toy
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:38:00.560]  not even real bb guns and and having no law and saying we don't care
[2:38:00.560 --> 2:38:05.200]  uh... spying on us without warrants uh... i mean this is happening bermas i'm
[2:38:05.200 --> 2:38:09.120]  gonna move on to calls go ahead and finish some of the last subsections
[2:38:09.120 --> 2:38:13.840]  let's see i just really want to hit on this one subsection again
[2:38:13.840 --> 2:38:16.560]  section twelve there's a bunch of other subsections
[2:38:16.560 --> 2:38:19.760]  um... the i just want to go over the cyber scholarship program because it's
[2:38:19.760 --> 2:38:22.800]  so important alex the director of the national science foundation shall
[2:38:22.800 --> 2:38:26.000]  establish a federal cyber scholarship for service program and it's gonna sound
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.880]  real nice your kid is going to come home with that letter
[2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:32.160]  and they say you're he's a junior computer genius we want to
[2:38:32.160 --> 2:38:35.120]  have him for our summer program we want to even give you money
[2:38:35.120 --> 2:38:38.960]  and then they indoctrinate your child to spy on you know this is homeland
[2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:42.000]  security cia uh... go to the next one
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:46.960]  let's see what we got here uh... because i read it about a month ago on air
[2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:49.440]  and there's a lot of other key subsections there at the end talk about
[2:38:49.440 --> 2:38:53.520]  giving prizes prizes remember the cash prizes for cctv
[2:38:53.520 --> 2:38:57.120]  cameras in the united kingdom how they're going to spy on criminals and people
[2:38:57.120 --> 2:39:00.320]  are going to watch random cctv cameras it's right here prizes under the
[2:39:00.320 --> 2:39:03.120]  section may consist of federal appropriated funds and funds by the
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:07.120]  private sector for such cash prizes so they're making it a reward that's like
[2:39:07.120 --> 2:39:10.880]  the irs now paying people to spy on their neighbors and inside businesses
[2:39:10.880 --> 2:39:13.840]  and just make stuff up returning to the total snitch society
[2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:16.720]  absolutely and there's a bunch of collusion in here uh... basically
[2:39:16.720 --> 2:39:20.880]  administering the competition regulates the competition it will be even worse
[2:39:20.880 --> 2:39:25.440]  than the uh... two giants microsoft and macintosh no one will be able to get
[2:39:25.440 --> 2:39:29.600]  into the game of writing software alex there will be no other operating
[2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:33.360]  systems and all the operating systems will be approved by the federal
[2:39:33.360 --> 2:39:36.880]  government we already know there are so many back doors
[2:39:36.880 --> 2:39:41.680]  uh... windows vista the new windows seven we know google is working with the
[2:39:41.680 --> 2:39:45.040]  nsa obviously apple is a front for intelligence
[2:39:45.040 --> 2:39:50.000]  with their iphone the iphone it was revealed i believe six months ago alex
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:53.920]  every time one of those boxes collapses it takes a picture with your camera and
[2:39:53.920 --> 2:39:56.880]  stores it in a temporary folder that then can be accessed
[2:39:56.880 --> 2:40:00.000]  and this is really all just an extension
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:03.760]  of what we saw in the nineties with echelon
[2:40:03.760 --> 2:40:08.560]  and carnivore and these other type of track trace and database programs that
[2:40:08.560 --> 2:40:12.160]  would look for key words and then uh... basically database you
[2:40:12.160 --> 2:40:15.760]  put you into a system try to profile you
[2:40:15.760 --> 2:40:18.960]  and this is the next extension a lot of people don't understand under the bush
[2:40:18.960 --> 2:40:21.840]  administration outside of the warrantless wiretaps
[2:40:21.840 --> 2:40:25.040]  we had them admitting that they were tracking tracing and databases
[2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:28.160]  everything we do on a computer from i ams
[2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:31.680]  two emails to talking on our cell phone absolutely bernie's thanks for coming
[2:40:31.680 --> 2:40:34.080]  in with that there's even a lot more in there and curtain emma and paul was in
[2:40:34.080 --> 2:40:36.880]  written articles about it thank you thank you appreciate you spending time
[2:40:36.880 --> 2:40:41.200]  with us okay here's what i want to do i want to go to
[2:40:41.200 --> 2:40:47.920]  rikita dalton kelly tom ben and many others that are patiently holding
[2:40:47.920 --> 2:40:51.360]  we're taking first-time calls today i do that every few weeks of people that
[2:40:51.360 --> 2:40:55.760]  can ever get in have a chance to be heard on air one eight hundred two five
[2:40:55.760 --> 2:41:00.000]  nine ninety two thirty one
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:04.800]  and then i want to get into several key stacks of news
[2:41:04.800 --> 2:41:07.840]  that i have here in front of me that i haven't even gotten into yet
[2:41:07.840 --> 2:41:11.120]  and i want to plow back through an article i started talking about but it's
[2:41:11.120 --> 2:41:13.040]  so important i'm gonna get back into it
[2:41:13.040 --> 2:41:18.800]  coffee party founder is obama campaign operative see
[2:41:18.800 --> 2:41:22.640]  two months ago we had the idea to start a coffee party to wake up
[2:41:22.640 --> 2:41:25.680]  the tea party that they're being taken over by mainline republicans
[2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:29.520]  who don't want to audit the fellow reserve that don't want to repeal
[2:41:29.520 --> 2:41:36.960]  unconstitutional gun laws that are pro patriot act in police state
[2:41:36.960 --> 2:41:40.560]  but they're posing as patriots so it'd be the coffee party well obama has now
[2:41:40.560 --> 2:41:44.960]  created one to be pro government pro corrupt government
[2:41:44.960 --> 2:41:48.000]  and this is another one of his initiatives to try to get all these fake
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:51.520]  community organizations out there working for them and spy on american
[2:41:51.520 --> 2:41:55.120]  citizens remember when they said report fishy neighbors or people that criticize
[2:41:55.120 --> 2:41:59.760]  the government to the white house so uh that is coming up as well but
[2:41:59.760 --> 2:42:04.000]  right now i want to go ahead and go to some of your phone calls
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:07.600]  rakita in maryland you're on the air go ahead
[2:42:07.600 --> 2:42:14.400]  hi alex how are you i'm i'm i'm well okay um i was just listening to your
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:20.160]  segment and i was curious to know if you knew if the nielson company had any
[2:42:20.160 --> 2:42:25.360]  tile ties to the government well i mean nielson gets you to put a
[2:42:25.360 --> 2:42:29.040]  tracker box on your cable box or television
[2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:34.720]  the tracks what you watch but a any digital cable box or tivo tracks what
[2:42:34.720 --> 2:42:37.040]  you watch and what you do in this two way
[2:42:37.040 --> 2:42:40.560]  just like a computer it is a computer uh that's admitted
[2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:46.880]  uh but uh i don't particularly know about nielson
[2:42:46.880 --> 2:42:52.080]  i was i was curious because i'm a i'm currently a nielson house
[2:42:52.080 --> 2:42:56.160]  and oh probably about a week and a half ago
[2:42:56.160 --> 2:43:00.480]  um when they came by to you know check the box and do updates
[2:43:00.480 --> 2:43:03.920]  they were wondering if they they were asking me if they could put
[2:43:03.920 --> 2:43:08.320]  some device on my computer so they could monitor
[2:43:08.320 --> 2:43:12.320]  i guess what page is i was going to on the internet
[2:43:12.320 --> 2:43:16.240]  yeah well that's already going on they just want you to openly go along with
[2:43:16.240 --> 2:43:20.800]  them google all the major systems time warner spy record everything
[2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:25.920]  sell it to the government that's on record uh so they're just wanting you
[2:43:25.920 --> 2:43:30.000]  to pay you so that they can publicly uh use
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:34.960]  the data uh but uh this is already going on with your computer it's already
[2:43:34.960 --> 2:43:37.600]  going on with the digital cable box it's already going on with all cell phones
[2:43:37.600 --> 2:43:43.200]  under federal law everything is a tracking grid
[2:43:44.160 --> 2:43:50.720]  oh wow so even if i didn't agree to it there's someone tracking
[2:43:50.720 --> 2:43:54.720]  the pages i'm going to anyway yes i appreciate your call
[2:43:54.720 --> 2:44:00.320]  now about 10 years ago separate companies from arbitron that tracks radio
[2:44:00.320 --> 2:44:05.040]  similar to nielson a a a m or f m receiver
[2:44:05.040 --> 2:44:09.840]  in a car or in your home or on a boat or wherever it is
[2:44:09.840 --> 2:44:13.920]  doesn't just receive it transmits at a much lower level
[2:44:13.920 --> 2:44:18.640]  part of the receiving is a micro transmitting and so they started putting
[2:44:18.640 --> 2:44:24.080]  in billboards all over the country that would as cars drove by
[2:44:24.080 --> 2:44:27.760]  be able to scan what frequency they were listening to and if you've noticed
[2:44:27.760 --> 2:44:31.840]  with digital frequencies now in your car it'll tell you what station you're
[2:44:31.840 --> 2:44:37.040]  listening to even what song's on because out over the carrier
[2:44:37.040 --> 2:44:44.400]  of the a m or f m they're also sending out a data information stream
[2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:48.320]  that tells your a m f m radio in your car even the cheapest ones
[2:44:48.320 --> 2:44:52.480]  exactly what you're doing they're also moving towards people meters
[2:44:52.480 --> 2:44:56.720]  like a nielson box in the cars and that's being phased in it's already in
[2:44:56.720 --> 2:45:00.480]  most the country uh but this is just where they admit
[2:45:00.480 --> 2:45:04.000]  they're doing this and where you opt in google four years ago said they're
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:08.560]  using cameras and microphones on over 150 million computers in the us to
[2:45:08.560 --> 2:45:10.720]  listen to everything you're doing in your house
[2:45:10.720 --> 2:45:13.360]  and people thought when i was reading their own press release i was making
[2:45:13.360 --> 2:45:16.240]  that up i had people at the local radio station
[2:45:16.240 --> 2:45:20.640]  when i was doing the sunday show out of uh at the time
[2:45:20.640 --> 2:45:24.320]  would make jokes when i walked down the hall oh they're watching me on the
[2:45:24.320 --> 2:45:28.720]  camera on my computer you know that's up at the top of the screen
[2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:32.400]  oh they're listening to me alex are they going to get me
[2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:36.160]  i tell people 14 years ago the digital cable boxes were tracking everything you
[2:45:36.160 --> 2:45:38.720]  did because i had the manuals that were sent to me
[2:45:38.720 --> 2:45:42.560]  uh in one case of the atlantic scientific or scientific atlantic
[2:45:42.560 --> 2:45:47.040]  uh box now it's all admitted and now all the schools are watching the children
[2:45:47.040 --> 2:45:50.080]  when they go home with their government issued laptops
[2:45:50.080 --> 2:45:54.480]  so this is a total control grid and it's the same thing with all the new cell
[2:45:54.480 --> 2:45:57.920]  phones so people are like well then why do you have a free iphone app why why do
[2:45:57.920 --> 2:46:01.200]  you have a cell phone well i mean we're using the matrix to get people out of
[2:46:01.200 --> 2:46:04.080]  the matrix i mean to be stupid if i just said i was
[2:46:04.080 --> 2:46:07.520]  going to be amish and move out in the middle of nowhere and
[2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:11.280]  just scream from the top of a mountain i'm i'm in the grid
[2:46:11.280 --> 2:46:16.880]  telling you about the grid but um let's continue with phone calls was
[2:46:16.880 --> 2:46:20.800]  really good question uh dalton in detroit you're on the air dalton
[2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:25.200]  hey alex say i want to thank you for helping this country and changed my life
[2:46:25.200 --> 2:46:29.360]  uh one quick thank you man one quick statement i think that the iris playing
[2:46:29.360 --> 2:46:33.520]  crash with mr stack was not an inside job because i think if it was
[2:46:33.520 --> 2:46:36.960]  the government would be still playing it up every single day well they have been
[2:46:36.960 --> 2:46:40.000]  playing it up on quite a few channels but uh go ahead
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:43.520]  uh second thing how much validity do you lay in the heist
[2:46:43.520 --> 2:46:48.000]  with uh elgene span robert rubin leary summers over at fort tungsten
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:53.120]  excuse me fort nox and you know you know there's always there's always stories
[2:46:53.120 --> 2:46:56.960]  dalton that can't be confirmed that oh carl rove was arrested in europe not
[2:46:56.960 --> 2:47:00.880]  true then you learn the sources of media that always put out this info
[2:47:00.880 --> 2:47:04.720]  after a few times doing it uh you know it's kind of like the hoax of the
[2:47:04.720 --> 2:47:10.320]  amaro coin that was just a uh you know memorabilia made as a joke by a small

[2:48:56.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  seriously i don't think that we're going to have

[2:49:06.320 --> 2:49:11.840]  anymore i don't think the electoral process is
[2:49:11.840 --> 2:49:15.840]  immune anymore everything is done electronically now
[2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:18.800]  so we don't know who has access to the information
[2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:24.640]  when we go to our precinct and the government is building giant paramilitary
[2:49:24.640 --> 2:49:28.640]  armies against the people i mean there's no doubt we're in trouble but we are
[2:49:28.640 --> 2:49:33.520]  having a lot of uh success in waking people up and we're
[2:49:33.520 --> 2:49:37.360]  having victories at the state level uh we're having victories in congress we're
[2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:40.400]  defeating their healthcare bill their climate takeover bill

[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:55.440]  and so we have a record low flu because the flu shot a studies show is giving
[2:49:55.440 --> 2:50:00.080]  people the flu now we're having so many victories we're also having defeats
[2:50:00.080 --> 2:50:06.720]  um but people talk about physically stopping it i mean what do you do i mean

[2:54:15.760 --> 2:54:19.280]  as much as fema and the media demonize the founding fathers that's what july
[2:54:19.280 --> 2:54:21.520]  4th is that's what this country was founded on
[2:54:21.520 --> 2:54:25.360]  was standing up against tyrants the founders didn't go out and get violent
[2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:30.240]  until the paramilitary police came to confiscate their guns
[2:54:30.240 --> 2:54:36.080]  and if the government tries more waco's it will probably kick off a civil war
[2:54:36.080 --> 2:54:41.600]  and then all of these effeminate tough guy police and paramilitary with all

[2:55:03.840 --> 2:55:08.640]  i mean if enough people in every city file lawsuits go to city council every
[2:55:08.640 --> 2:55:11.600]  week educate the public about what they put in
[2:55:11.600 --> 2:55:14.800]  the water supply it's not just fluoride it's hundreds of deadly chemicals
[2:55:14.800 --> 2:55:19.760]  if you send people the epa zone admissions how it causes bone cancer
[2:55:19.760 --> 2:55:23.360]  you know i mean that's just one issue or if you point out how your cities in
[2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:28.400]  800 plus cities in the u.s or sanctuary cities where illegals can drunk drive
[2:55:28.400 --> 2:55:32.320]  assault people and and don't even go to jail and don't have to have ids

[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:55.440]  urban area i mean every person you wake up
[2:55:55.440 --> 2:55:59.200]  every mind you unlock is huge the pentagon says 90 percent of their
[2:55:59.200 --> 2:56:02.880]  operations are psychological we need to counter with the truth
[2:56:02.880 --> 2:56:06.080]  which is the most powerful psychological tool out there
[2:56:06.080 --> 2:56:12.800]  uh... but uh... you know you talk about physical
[2:56:12.800 --> 2:56:16.400]  the system is intimidated they are concerned they they can't get our guns
[2:56:16.400 --> 2:56:19.520]  they're trying they're failing on so many fronts

[2:56:46.480 --> 2:56:49.200]  up all your films did and then they wake up other people
[2:56:49.200 --> 2:56:52.640]  i mean we're not just here talking we're here reaching people that's why the
[2:56:52.640 --> 2:56:55.120]  media and the government push their stuff over media
[2:56:55.120 --> 2:56:58.720]  because this stuff has an effect and people turn into this show they're
[2:56:58.720 --> 2:57:02.880]  never the same uh... but i mean uh... what are you getting at tom
[2:57:02.880 --> 2:57:06.640]  what i'm getting at is you can
[2:57:06.640 --> 2:57:10.800]  you are you are the one person that we need on the airways
[2:57:10.800 --> 2:57:14.400]  but we ourselves as individuals out here
[2:57:14.400 --> 2:57:19.520]  in the country in the cities in the towns in the little birds
[2:57:19.520 --> 2:57:22.720]  you need to know who your neighbors are you need to
[2:57:22.720 --> 2:57:28.000]  organize you need to sit down and talk to each other and find out who you can
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:32.880]  rely on who you can trust because when the man comes through the door
[2:57:32.880 --> 2:57:37.120]  he is going to do it at his advantage
[2:57:37.120 --> 2:57:41.040]  he might stop you on your way home from the grocery store
[2:57:41.040 --> 2:57:44.400]  and you might go into jail and disappear for a while
[2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:47.360]  no it's easy i mean they're tracking everybody's cell phone in lifetime
[2:57:47.360 --> 2:57:50.160]  let's pick alex jones up he's going to the grocery store
[2:57:50.160 --> 2:57:53.360]  absolutely i mean just it just goes on and on
[2:57:53.360 --> 2:57:58.160]  you can fall back on you can't be an individual out here anymore
[2:57:58.160 --> 2:58:01.520]  there you have to have people in your community
[2:58:01.520 --> 2:58:04.720]  and i know that there's a lot a lot of people
[2:58:04.720 --> 2:58:08.640]  in these communities in texas and every state the united states
[2:58:08.640 --> 2:58:11.440]  and you can get to know your neighbors how many people
[2:58:11.440 --> 2:58:15.040]  do you know that live three or four or five blocks
[2:58:15.040 --> 2:58:19.200]  away from your house i bet most people can count them on
[2:58:19.200 --> 2:58:22.960]  three fingers usually it's the guy behind you
[2:58:22.960 --> 2:58:26.960]  the guy on the left or the right of you and the guy directly across the street
[2:58:26.960 --> 2:58:30.160]  yeah because everybody's got to get in there and turn the tv on and let it
[2:58:30.160 --> 2:58:33.360]  program them instead of even knowing their neighbors we're losing our
[2:58:33.360 --> 2:58:36.720]  humanity i agree getting to know your neighbors turning
[2:58:36.720 --> 2:58:42.880]  the television off is the first step in destroying the globalist

[3:00:36.880 --> 3:00:40.080]  good that's probably the best thing most effective thing people could do is
[3:00:40.080 --> 3:00:43.840]  get a big stack printer and print tons of fall the republic out or whichever

[3:00:48.240 --> 3:00:52.320]  um i just agree with the other caller i think the uh joe stack thing does look
[3:00:52.320 --> 3:00:55.440]  like it stays because the damage on the building for one
[3:00:55.440 --> 3:00:58.560]  is intelligence connections and it's really hard to believe
[3:00:58.560 --> 3:01:02.960]  that you had you had the emergency crews there beforehand that's now admitted
[3:01:02.960 --> 3:01:07.280]  multiple witnesses saw no one in the plane uh you've got it just goes on and
[3:01:07.280 --> 3:01:11.120]  on it sounds cartoonish that he loaded a barrel of fuel into the back of his
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:15.120]  plane too i mean it sounds like more cartoons physics explanations
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:18.480]  same with 9-11 they give you cartoon explanations oh at uh
[3:01:18.480 --> 3:01:22.640]  evaporate we found two passports within a few hours on the ground after all the
[3:01:22.640 --> 3:01:26.400]  buildings fell yeah exactly i think we found an
[3:01:26.400 --> 3:01:31.120]  Easter Bunny out there too uh i'm sorry i was gonna say that the uh coffee
[3:01:31.120 --> 3:01:35.680]  party is a great idea and um i i think it's awesome that you're
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:39.440]  gonna go ahead with it anyway even though they're trying to um
[3:01:39.440 --> 3:01:44.400]  get a jump on it with the uh uh what's her name
[3:01:44.400 --> 3:01:48.640]  obama and and that's being done so people go coffee party you're with
[3:01:48.640 --> 3:01:51.920]  obama instead of us having a coffee party that's
[3:01:51.920 --> 3:01:55.440]  more hardcore than the republican run tea party that they've taken over
[3:01:55.440 --> 3:02:01.360]  now they'll go you're with the coffee party that's some kind of commie group
[3:02:02.240 --> 3:02:05.680]  so i think yeah i think you can go with it right now and still get you know
[3:02:05.680 --> 3:02:09.600]  like you say you have way more people on facebook that'll jump on it and uh
[3:02:09.600 --> 3:02:12.080]  and maybe they'll come to our side because i think a lot of these people
[3:02:12.080 --> 3:02:15.520]  are upset with obama anyway we should really reach out to the uh
[3:02:15.520 --> 3:02:20.560]  the democrats who are starting to wake up then i appreciate your call uh let's
[3:02:20.560 --> 3:02:25.680]  talk to tom in illinois tom you're on the air
[3:02:25.680 --> 3:02:28.960]  hello yes sir oh this is tony
[3:02:28.960 --> 3:02:33.520]  but illinois yeah i'll thank you for waking my mind up you know say my mind
[3:02:33.520 --> 3:02:36.320]  used to be in the gutter but i've watched some of your videos and i've ordered
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:39.040]  with all the republic and i'm about to start burning them and handing them
[3:02:39.040 --> 3:02:43.120]  out to people and i have a question i was wondering if ron paul was elected
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:45.680]  president would he try these people that committed
[3:02:45.680 --> 3:02:48.000]  treatment against our country would he try them
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:52.160]  because i know it would be dangerous to try one of them at a time well ron paul
[3:02:52.160 --> 3:02:55.920]  would say under the constitution the president doesn't have that power
[3:02:55.920 --> 3:02:58.960]  uh but i know he would call for criminal investigations
[3:02:58.960 --> 3:03:03.920]  of these people by the justice department yes he said that the bankers
[3:03:03.920 --> 3:03:08.000]  have all openly committed crimes the big private bank heads goldman sacks jp
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:11.760]  morgan chase and others and he's called for state grand juries to indict them
[3:03:11.760 --> 3:03:15.120]  he's done that on this show before yeah i'm talking about the people in the
[3:03:15.120 --> 3:03:18.800]  government like president bush and cheney they murdered a lot of people
[3:03:18.800 --> 3:03:22.160]  millions of thousands of people chained shut them within the face with a
[3:03:22.160 --> 3:03:25.520]  shotgun and that's just crazy how people can get away with
[3:03:25.520 --> 3:03:28.480]  that if i would do something like that i'd be sending my life from prison
[3:03:28.480 --> 3:03:32.960]  well it's even worse than that i mean cheney it's now been declassified wanted
[3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:37.760]  to launch a nuclear attack on russia on 888 in 2008
[3:03:37.760 --> 3:03:42.640]  and it was on record that us and israeli backed georgians
[3:03:42.640 --> 3:03:46.320]  attacked south oceania the russian held area
[3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:51.680]  and the cnn said the russians have attacked and five days later had to
[3:03:51.680 --> 3:03:56.720]  admit it wasn't true and then i've got neocons criticizing me saying i made it
[3:03:56.720 --> 3:03:59.360]  up that the russians attacked and then i'm a
[3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:02.560]  ruski or something i mean it's just it's just
[3:04:02.560 --> 3:04:09.200]  it's incredible the level of lies of the things they will do the things they
[3:04:09.200 --> 3:04:13.120]  will say you know they say well you you you work for the iranians because you
[3:04:13.120 --> 3:04:16.320]  don't want to attack them no i don't want to have world war three
[3:04:16.320 --> 3:04:21.920]  start or they say uh that alex jones he works for out
[3:04:21.920 --> 3:04:25.840]  kata because he's saying it's a 911 inside job i mean i've had mainline
[3:04:25.840 --> 3:04:29.600]  publications say that with absolutely no proof i mean it's just
[3:04:29.600 --> 3:04:34.800]  asinine and you know ron paul if you got elected
[3:04:34.800 --> 3:04:38.400]  would do good just to stay alive and try to audit the fed and do some things
[3:04:38.400 --> 3:04:41.840]  like that uh but uh i mean i can't speak for ron paul what he
[3:04:41.840 --> 3:04:45.600]  would do if he was president i think we focus too much on the president
[3:04:45.600 --> 3:04:49.920]  we have 50 states under the constitution the the federal government is
[3:04:49.920 --> 3:04:53.600]  out of control we have to get control of our states and then get control of our
[3:04:53.600 --> 3:04:56.720]  federal government right now that's run by offshore banks that are out of
[3:04:56.720 --> 3:05:00.880]  control okay let's talk to alex ray
[3:05:00.880 --> 3:05:05.760]  marty and others hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century
[3:05:05.760 --> 3:05:09.120]  alone this is our last chance to not relive
[3:05:09.120 --> 3:05:12.000]  history as we're finishing off this agenda
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:15.040]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath americans at home
[3:05:15.040 --> 3:05:19.040]  i've turned a member's influence on our president in congress
[3:05:19.040 --> 3:05:23.760]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[3:05:23.760 --> 3:05:28.560]  as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies
[3:05:28.560 --> 3:05:32.000]  of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:36.240]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[3:05:36.240 --> 3:05:40.160]  tim geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches
[3:05:40.160 --> 3:05:43.520]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like
[3:05:43.520 --> 3:05:48.240]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen
[3:05:48.240 --> 3:05:53.040]  a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd

[3:07:04.400 --> 3:07:08.080]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[3:07:08.080 --> 3:07:11.840]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[3:07:11.840 --> 3:07:15.440]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[3:07:15.440 --> 3:07:19.680]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[3:07:19.680 --> 3:07:23.360]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[3:07:23.360 --> 3:07:27.760]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[3:07:27.760 --> 3:07:31.680]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[3:07:31.680 --> 3:07:34.800]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[3:07:34.800 --> 3:07:38.720]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[3:07:38.720 --> 3:07:41.600]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[3:07:41.600 --> 3:07:44.720]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[3:08:09.600 --> 3:08:14.160]  we are continuing with wide open phones
[3:08:14.160 --> 3:08:16.880]  i'm gonna take a few more calls right now that i want to hit on some other news
[3:08:16.880 --> 3:08:21.200]  we haven't gotten to yet
[3:08:21.200 --> 3:08:24.400]  but i want to say this to a lot of the new listeners out there
[3:08:24.400 --> 3:08:29.840]  you're tuning in everything we talk about on this show is documented on record
[3:08:29.840 --> 3:08:34.400]  we do have an illegitimate unelected global corporate government
[3:08:34.400 --> 3:08:38.240]  openly set up announcing that it's taking over our planet
[3:08:38.240 --> 3:08:44.720]  and that their final political aim is to shut off resources to the planet
[3:08:44.720 --> 3:08:49.040]  and have one child policies and basically live like the communist chinese
[3:08:49.040 --> 3:08:55.680]  and earlier i played a cnn clip praising communism and now satan i mean i mean
[3:08:55.680 --> 3:08:58.800]  this is really happening
[3:08:59.760 --> 3:09:05.120]  and the police are out of control the government is out of control
[3:09:05.120 --> 3:09:09.920]  they are i mean this is tyranny we know what corruption is we know what
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:13.280]  tyranny is i've got a stack of news i covered some
[3:09:13.280 --> 3:09:16.960]  of it earlier where their states are passing taxes on food
[3:09:16.960 --> 3:09:20.800]  only the worst tyrannies do that they're getting ready to pass carbon taxes
[3:09:20.800 --> 3:09:24.560]  even if the people don't want it direct taxes on the oil companies
[3:09:24.560 --> 3:09:28.800]  that they'll pass on to consumers um taxes
[3:09:28.800 --> 3:09:32.400]  when you buy dinner that are going to go to state health care programs
[3:09:32.400 --> 3:09:39.440]  um i see articles every day here's usa today police partner with license plate
[3:09:39.440 --> 3:09:42.560]  readers everywhere they're tracking your license plate
[3:09:42.560 --> 3:09:46.160]  where you go not just when you go through toll roads
[3:09:46.160 --> 3:09:50.240]  it's an orwellian nightmare and they're using it
[3:09:50.240 --> 3:09:53.920]  to control the population and suppress the population we're in a lot of
[3:09:53.920 --> 3:09:57.280]  trouble and the average government bureaucrat or person
[3:09:57.280 --> 3:10:01.680]  that works for a corporation that's getting government contracts
[3:10:01.680 --> 3:10:04.640]  they're arrogant they think they're winners they think it's funny they have
[3:10:04.640 --> 3:10:08.640]  disdain for the public and then so much of the general public
[3:10:08.640 --> 3:10:14.720]  has this attitude of well how does it affect me
[3:10:14.720 --> 3:10:17.520]  you know you'll tell somebody that tyranny's coming down on them and that
[3:10:17.520 --> 3:10:20.000]  they're in trouble and then historically they should be worried
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:23.280]  that the establishment has stated all their evil designs and they'll say how
[3:10:23.280 --> 3:10:26.080]  does that affect me it's like an arrogance like they have an attitude
[3:10:26.080 --> 3:10:28.560]  that if they just say how does that affect me i don't care
[3:10:28.560 --> 3:10:32.480]  that supposedly gives them power over it
[3:10:32.480 --> 3:10:37.360]  the biggest thing is we need people to start
[3:10:37.360 --> 3:10:40.960]  respecting themselves again and believing in the power they have
[3:10:40.960 --> 3:10:44.800]  to say no to this system and we need people to reach out to their friends
[3:10:44.800 --> 3:10:48.480]  their family their co-workers their neighbors their local government
[3:10:48.480 --> 3:10:52.560]  with books with videos with materials i mean every caller calls in i found
[3:10:52.560 --> 3:10:56.320]  your show because of your videos somebody gave me a copy almost everybody
[3:10:56.320 --> 3:11:01.440]  it's over 90 percent most other talk show hosts or website people i talk to
[3:11:01.440 --> 3:11:05.280]  say yeah i woke up because of you
[3:11:06.080 --> 3:11:09.920]  now i don't even want that credit that's a dangerous position to be in
[3:11:09.920 --> 3:11:14.160]  because all the co-intel pro and government media attacks come our way
[3:11:14.160 --> 3:11:17.040]  but in the end i've done my job because i woke people up
[3:11:17.040 --> 3:11:21.280]  with the truth um you know i've done two hours three hours

[3:16:06.640 --> 3:16:09.920]  makes this radio show what we do so much possible because
[3:16:09.920 --> 3:16:14.880]  our bandwidth bill uh is
[3:16:14.880 --> 3:16:21.040]  massive and we are just exponentially growing so it's
[3:16:21.040 --> 3:16:24.720]  going up and up and up and up and the economy is falling apart so we're
[3:16:24.720 --> 3:16:27.440]  bringing in the same amount of money we were bringing in three years ago
[3:16:27.440 --> 3:16:31.680]  our audience in the last two years is actually quadruple now you go to alexa
[3:16:31.680 --> 3:16:34.960]  all the rating sites and see it for yourself
[3:16:34.960 --> 3:16:38.320]  the radio show audience has probably gotten 10 times bigger the last three
[3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:42.400]  years but internet traffic four times it's actually
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:46.720]  doubled the last year so i when i say quadruple that's an underestimation
[3:16:46.720 --> 3:16:51.520]  um but the same amount of money is coming in
[3:16:51.520 --> 3:16:55.120]  so we're okay but i'm building the tv studio
[3:16:55.120 --> 3:16:58.320]  that's been held with the city my god six months are trying to get permits with
[3:16:58.320 --> 3:17:02.240]  these people uh it's finally they're over there building it
[3:17:02.240 --> 3:17:07.200]  and we live in such a communist country it's just indescribable
[3:17:07.200 --> 3:17:13.680]  um the point is we're expanding we're moving forward
[3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:17.200]  i am building a mega social networking slash blog
[3:17:17.200 --> 3:17:20.800]  slash you name it meetup type site we've now
[3:17:20.800 --> 3:17:25.200]  committed that's being built by a top firm here in austin
[3:17:25.200 --> 3:17:30.720]  in consult consultation with my it guys and we're going to launch the coffee
[3:17:30.720 --> 3:17:34.480]  party which was our listeners idea that obama has now stolen
[3:17:34.480 --> 3:17:38.080]  i mean giving that out how good our ideas are that come from the listeners
[3:17:38.080 --> 3:17:41.120]  so we've got a counter that everybody started coffee party and say no this is
[3:17:41.120 --> 3:17:46.880]  not your deal obama all of that is going on
[3:17:46.880 --> 3:17:51.760]  this obama lady claims that the federal government is good and we need to work
[3:17:51.760 --> 3:17:55.280]  through it and that that's the coffee party she worked she's worked for obama
[3:17:55.280 --> 3:17:58.880]  she's one of his minions she claims she loves the tea party and wants them to
[3:17:58.880 --> 3:18:01.920]  join her coffee party seeing and everybody else has had her on their
[3:18:01.920 --> 3:18:04.960]  pushing her she's worked for the new york times they didn't
[3:18:04.960 --> 3:18:08.000]  tell you that when they wrote an article about how great she is
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:11.360]  so now obama like the republicans posing as tea party people
[3:18:11.360 --> 3:18:14.400]  obama wants to come in with the coffee party and take it over this is what she
[3:18:14.400 --> 3:18:18.240]  said on her facebook about tea party people we're in mortal danger of going
[3:18:18.240 --> 3:18:22.880]  backwards get some coffee get off your butt and
[3:18:22.880 --> 3:18:27.200]  join the movement for change no more reading tea leaves get the job done no
[3:18:27.200 --> 3:18:31.520]  more excuses stop the bad punditry stop
[3:18:31.520 --> 3:18:35.360]  reading tea leaves we will overwhelm the polling stations in november we want
[3:18:35.360 --> 3:18:39.760]  change we want change we want we must deal with reality
[3:18:39.760 --> 3:18:45.120]  instead of indulging in paranoid fantasies of the tea party and it just goes on
[3:18:45.120 --> 3:18:48.320]  and on we're not going to take this tea crap anymore
[3:18:48.320 --> 3:18:54.480]  let's work for change so this is her just two months ago but now
[3:18:54.480 --> 3:18:57.920]  oh she wants to work with the tea parties and take them over
[3:18:57.920 --> 3:19:01.440]  with the coffee party to wake up the tea party even using
[3:19:01.440 --> 3:19:05.520]  the slogan that my listeners again two months ago emailing and calling i don't
[3:19:05.520 --> 3:19:09.360]  even know who you are saying alex you need to launch this you got you you need
[3:19:09.360 --> 3:19:14.000]  to get it going and i i registered domains a month ago and just never did it
[3:19:14.000 --> 3:19:16.800]  obviously i can't travel around the country and start rallies and do it
[3:19:16.800 --> 3:19:20.160]  we'll just explain what the real coffee party is
[3:19:20.160 --> 3:19:24.160]  from the listeners and my idea of saying look the republicans are taking over
[3:19:24.160 --> 3:19:27.440]  the tea parties we want this to be nonpartisan the coffee parties here to
[3:19:27.440 --> 3:19:31.760]  wake up the tea party don't be co-opted by the republicans and democrats
[3:19:31.760 --> 3:19:35.680]  now the democrats are openly coming into co-op they have to do this or they'll
[3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:40.880]  be replaced with the american people but again work through your states take
[3:19:40.880 --> 3:19:44.960]  over your states peacefully through the legislative process we have the numbers

[3:24:14.160 --> 3:24:20.080]  yeah hi welcome i was watching uh follow the republic and it's a great movie
[3:24:20.080 --> 3:24:22.960]  there was just one point i noticed when you were talking about the explorer
[3:24:22.960 --> 3:24:26.800]  program um they were training them to search out
[3:24:26.800 --> 3:24:29.600]  terrorists and you called them uh you're saying they're a
[3:24:29.600 --> 3:24:33.120]  co affiliate of boy scouts and that's what the article said and i just wanted
[3:24:33.120 --> 3:24:36.960]  to let you know um i'm a longtime boy scout i'm an ego scout i'm the assistant
[3:24:36.960 --> 3:24:42.160]  scout master my troop right now and i teach my scouts nothing but patriotism
[3:24:42.160 --> 3:24:46.800]  um i point out like on the uh scout symbol there's a
[3:24:46.800 --> 3:24:49.680]  sir let me just throw this out when i put that film out
[3:24:49.680 --> 3:24:53.280]  three months ago four months ago people didn't even believe that
[3:24:53.280 --> 3:24:56.720]  now the la pd and a federal grant officially
[3:24:56.720 --> 3:25:01.120]  took over the boy scouts explorer program and in the new york times
[3:25:01.120 --> 3:25:04.400]  i believe that was uh arizona the particular training or was it new
[3:25:04.400 --> 3:25:07.600]  mexico they were training to take on disgruntled
[3:25:07.600 --> 3:25:11.600]  veterans and it showed photos of the mock dead veterans
[3:25:11.600 --> 3:25:16.560]  taken on by the 14-year-old boy scouts so i know the boy scouts have been good
[3:25:16.560 --> 3:25:20.560]  but just like hitler took over the german boy scouts the same thing is
[3:25:20.560 --> 3:25:23.840]  happening and they've got girl scouts training to spy on people
[3:25:23.840 --> 3:25:27.120]  i mean that's associated press that this is really
[3:25:27.120 --> 3:25:31.520]  happening okay i got back to that um
[3:25:31.520 --> 3:25:35.280]  well i just want to let you know as well um with my troop
[3:25:35.280 --> 3:25:38.960]  that's not happening and they assure you that i'm teaching my guys
[3:25:38.960 --> 3:25:42.320]  patriotism and exactly so we're trying to get
[3:25:42.320 --> 3:25:47.680]  the scouts of america to say no to homeland security taking it over
[3:25:47.680 --> 3:25:50.960]  yeah that's what i've been doing um the scouts symbol like i was saying the
[3:25:50.960 --> 3:25:55.440]  shield um represents freedom and the scouts readiness to defend freedom and
[3:25:55.440 --> 3:25:59.280]  make sure our scouts know that and other troops know that well great job alex
[3:25:59.280 --> 3:26:03.120]  but we're not saying the boy scouts are bad we're saying it's being taken over
[3:26:03.120 --> 3:26:06.320]  it's like saying the german military wasn't bad until hitler got control of
[3:26:06.320 --> 3:26:10.000]  it i mean our country's been hijacked by offshore corporations
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:13.440]  and they're turning everything into evil and so there's a battle for the heart
[3:26:13.440 --> 3:26:16.480]  and soul of not just the boy scouts but the girl scouts and the brownies

[3:33:29.200 --> 3:33:32.800]  we always look forward to our once a month visit with congressman ron paul
[3:33:32.800 --> 3:33:37.040]  he's got to go with 14 minutes i got my atomic clock to a key vote
[3:33:37.040 --> 3:33:40.880]  gotta be in a committee room so he's with us now i'm gonna move quickly
[3:33:40.880 --> 3:33:45.280]  first off congressman you won the straw poll at cpac
[3:33:45.280 --> 3:33:49.040]  uh... proving that most of the republicans are not warmongering neocons
[3:33:49.040 --> 3:33:53.120]  you got 84 percent approval rating in texas you won by a record 80 percent in
[3:33:53.120 --> 3:33:57.680]  the primary showing that america supports what you're doing
[3:33:57.680 --> 3:34:01.440]  uh... can you comment on the fact that uh... the
[3:34:01.440 --> 3:34:06.080]  well your take on this i was very pleased and somewhat surprised but it was
[3:34:06.080 --> 3:34:11.040]  a delight to have won that uh... cpac vote
[3:34:11.040 --> 3:34:14.560]  you know what was interesting is uh... you know the people who oppose us there
[3:34:14.560 --> 3:34:18.000]  they're still significant if i get thirty two percent of the vote at me there's
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:20.800]  a large number still complaining in their part of the
[3:34:20.800 --> 3:34:24.320]  the establishment but what i thought was interesting is
[3:34:24.320 --> 3:34:27.680]  all the sour grapes that was expressed afterwards they were complaining and
[3:34:27.680 --> 3:34:30.560]  oh this is not for real you know like they did in the campaign
[3:34:30.560 --> 3:34:34.640]  but what was interesting is somebody said that you know what we need to do
[3:34:34.640 --> 3:34:38.240]  is uh... for cpac to have any credibility they have to change the way
[3:34:38.240 --> 3:34:41.600]  they vote so they made it to be made a suggestion
[3:34:41.600 --> 3:34:45.200]  that nobody under twenty five would be a hot to vote which means
[3:34:45.200 --> 3:34:48.400]  and you know it too that there are a lot of young people who
[3:34:48.400 --> 3:34:51.520]  are interested in what we're talking about i think that's fortunate you know
[3:34:51.520 --> 3:34:56.400]  the next generation is not later on but currently they're inheriting this mess
[3:34:56.400 --> 3:34:59.280]  so i'm delighted to talk to young people but this whole idea
[3:34:59.280 --> 3:35:02.800]  that the people who don't like us challenging the status quo that
[3:35:02.800 --> 3:35:06.320]  well that's not let them vote next time but i i think that
[3:35:06.320 --> 3:35:09.840]  uh... there's a lot of people are coming our way every year and you know in the
[3:35:09.840 --> 3:35:13.440]  last two three years that there's been tremendous growth in our movement and
[3:35:13.440 --> 3:35:17.840]  that makes me very encouraged absolutely i want to
[3:35:17.840 --> 3:35:22.640]  cut to the chase here uh... and before we get into the banking situation
[3:35:22.640 --> 3:35:25.680]  a few months ago we were speaking at a campaign for liberty event
[3:35:25.680 --> 3:35:29.200]  and you threw the gauntlet down as you did back in the eighties in some videos
[3:35:29.200 --> 3:35:32.800]  i've seen you said we've had a cia coup in america
[3:35:32.800 --> 3:35:35.920]  they're bringing in the drugs most people don't know in ninety six
[3:35:35.920 --> 3:35:40.160]  the cia inspector general before congress admitted that
[3:35:40.160 --> 3:35:43.600]  uh... but it's wider than that we know wall street in the banking cartel
[3:35:43.600 --> 3:35:49.040]  the federal reserve system through yale and other outfits set up the oss and cia
[3:35:49.040 --> 3:35:52.400]  and you came right out and basically said this is our illegitimate government
[3:35:52.400 --> 3:35:55.760]  and that ties into the banks engineering the financial collapse now
[3:35:55.760 --> 3:35:59.120]  saying they're getting ready for an even bigger collapse sometime this year in a
[3:35:59.120 --> 3:36:03.200]  constitution of the world run by the banks
[3:36:03.200 --> 3:36:06.800]  as gordon brown and others called for can you specifically speak
[3:36:06.800 --> 3:36:12.080]  to who runs the coup who they are and how we remove them because by openly
[3:36:12.080 --> 3:36:14.640]  coming out and really telling it like it is we can
[3:36:14.640 --> 3:36:18.720]  we can cut to the chase well i have trouble naming names because i don't
[3:36:18.720 --> 3:36:22.320]  know all the names but the one thing i can verify
[3:36:22.320 --> 3:36:26.560]  is that people who should have responsibility for our national security
[3:36:26.560 --> 3:36:30.160]  intelligence gathering uh... the u.s congress they have
[3:36:30.160 --> 3:36:34.000]  no idea what's going on and that's the real problem
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:39.200]  and uh... it it fits together you know the secrecy of the
[3:36:39.200 --> 3:36:43.200]  of the cia as well as the secrecy of the fed they control the money and they
[3:36:43.200 --> 3:36:47.280]  control secret government people have referred to the cia as a secret army
[3:36:47.280 --> 3:36:50.800]  for the president but sometimes i wonder whether the president even have total
[3:36:50.800 --> 3:36:55.440]  control of the cia as well as many stories have been written
[3:36:55.440 --> 3:37:00.000]  about that so it's uh... it's something that uh... i think the
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:04.160]  american people have to realize uh... we do know there's been evidence uh...
[3:37:04.160 --> 3:37:09.120]  you know brought forth at the uh... cia actually can own banks and uh...
[3:37:09.120 --> 3:37:13.600]  there's been fairly strong evidence that uh... cia has been involved in drug
[3:37:13.600 --> 3:37:16.000]  dealing as uh... you know there are times when i think
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:19.680]  the war in afghanistan we say it has to do with pipes and oil
[3:37:19.680 --> 3:37:23.920]  uh... gas pipeline and oil and and other commercial things
[3:37:23.920 --> 3:37:28.320]  but there are the other commercial thing maybe the drug trade maybe uh...
[3:37:28.320 --> 3:37:32.480]  maybe the cia's in competition with the drug dealers over there
[3:37:32.480 --> 3:37:36.640]  because there's a lot of self financing in these uh... organization
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:40.800]  but i i don't take the position that i know all those answers
[3:37:40.800 --> 3:37:45.840]  and i don't know everything that the fed does but the one that my approach is
[3:37:45.840 --> 3:37:50.560]  that we people the people deserve it the congress has a responsibility to
[3:37:50.560 --> 3:37:54.480]  find out what they're doing and if they're not doing it fine and
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:37:57.120]  dandy will clear the air but if they are doing it
[3:37:57.120 --> 3:38:00.560]  it will give us more ammunition for the reason why we need a different monetary
[3:38:00.560 --> 3:38:04.000]  system and we need to have a different system of collecting intelligence
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:08.640]  because they can tell us anything remember how we went to war in iraq the cia
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:11.520]  was very much involved up there as a cia
[3:38:11.520 --> 3:38:16.480]  oh they have new weapons of mass destruction they're about to attack us
[3:38:16.480 --> 3:38:21.520]  and it was based on false information and this is this is what disturbs me the
[3:38:21.520 --> 3:38:26.800]  most and that's why i want much much more uh... you know transparency of what
[3:38:26.800 --> 3:38:30.320]  our government is doing well those were strong statements you made
[3:38:30.320 --> 3:38:33.840]  a few months ago when you just echoed them but but but specifically
[3:38:33.840 --> 3:38:37.120]  congress as you know has had hearings in the seventies about
[3:38:37.120 --> 3:38:40.960]  the shadow government continuity of government uh... the homeland security
[3:38:40.960 --> 3:38:43.280]  committee in the house has not been allowed to see
[3:38:43.280 --> 3:38:48.320]  the full tax of pdd-51 and we know we've seen a 12-fold in the last eight
[3:38:48.320 --> 3:38:51.360]  year increase in opium out of afghanistan
[3:38:51.360 --> 3:38:55.120]  uh... we know that two years ago a cia aircraft that had been used for torture
[3:38:55.120 --> 3:38:58.880]  flights crash in mexico with pure cocaine three and a half
[3:38:58.880 --> 3:39:02.560]  tons meaning coming directly from the source uncut
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:06.480]  uh... i mean this is just comes out in minna arkansas
[3:39:06.480 --> 3:39:11.920]  over and over again and uh... so when you talk about a coup over america
[3:39:11.920 --> 3:39:15.200]  uh... how do we ever ferret this out and remove it
[3:39:15.200 --> 3:39:18.880]  i mean do we start as you've been calling for an audit of the private
[3:39:18.880 --> 3:39:21.920]  fellow reserve yeah it won't happen until the people become
[3:39:21.920 --> 3:39:27.040]  really outrage they are growing in their outrage but it has to translate into
[3:39:27.040 --> 3:39:31.280]  different ideas and different respect for the constitution different people up
[3:39:31.280 --> 3:39:34.080]  here and we're in the midst of this transition and
[3:39:34.080 --> 3:39:37.520]  as the crisis worse than you know the real challenges as well
[3:39:37.520 --> 3:39:41.040]  will we end up with a dictatorship or are we going to have people who are
[3:39:41.040 --> 3:39:45.120]  demanding you know a republic and open government and uh...
[3:39:45.120 --> 3:39:49.360]  and that might take another 10-15 years to determine but in the midst of a crisis
[3:39:49.360 --> 3:39:51.840]  it's the worst time to present our views so
[3:39:51.840 --> 3:39:56.560]  that's why uh... we we have to do our best to get as many people to agree with
[3:39:56.560 --> 3:40:00.240]  this as possible so that in the rebuilding that we have some ideas
[3:40:00.240 --> 3:40:04.000]  about what the monetary system should be like and what our foreign policy ought
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:07.440]  to be like which means that if we have proper foreign policy the
[3:40:07.440 --> 3:40:13.440]  uh... the incentive to have this uh... cia excuse making excuses for knowing
[3:40:13.440 --> 3:40:16.000]  everything about us and everything is going on in the world
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:18.960]  that would all change it there would be i don't believe that we shouldn't have
[3:40:18.960 --> 3:40:23.040]  some intelligence gathering but i don't like these clandestine
[3:40:23.040 --> 3:40:26.160]  operations and killings and things that they've
[3:40:26.160 --> 3:40:29.840]  we've known to have to happen well dovetailing with that
[3:40:29.840 --> 3:40:33.920]  uh... you grilled bernacky a few days ago and then
[3:40:33.920 --> 3:40:36.640]  the chairman for those who haven't seen the video it's up on present planet dot
[3:40:36.640 --> 3:40:40.560]  com frank agree with you and said we need an investigation
[3:40:40.560 --> 3:40:44.160]  of uh... the admitted and i wouldn't pull the articles up
[3:40:44.160 --> 3:40:47.600]  you know uh... because bernacky was acting like it was preposterous but it's
[3:40:47.600 --> 3:40:50.880]  on record that bcci and the federal reserve
[3:40:50.880 --> 3:40:55.280]  it's on record in 2004 and five tens of billions of dollars from the federal
[3:40:55.280 --> 3:40:59.200]  reserve shipped on pallets into iraq uh... it's on record
[3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:03.120]  associated press that tens of billions of drug money has been found in the
[3:41:03.120 --> 3:41:08.080]  federal reserve bank of dallas uh... that was in 2000 that was in the ap
[3:41:08.080 --> 3:41:12.080]  and then bernacky just laughs at you and says it doesn't exist it's like potok
[3:41:12.080 --> 3:41:15.680]  from the southern poverty law center laughing and saying these tea party
[3:41:15.680 --> 3:41:19.200]  kooks believe in a world government when you've got every global leader
[3:41:19.200 --> 3:41:22.480]  calling for global government the imf calling for a new world order
[3:41:22.480 --> 3:41:25.520]  herman von rompy ban chi moon calling for it
[3:41:25.520 --> 3:41:28.640]  i mean i think they're really destroying what credibility they had left by
[3:41:28.640 --> 3:41:33.760]  stonewalling us can you speak specifically uh... to uh... congressional
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:37.600]  investigation separate from an audit just directly on
[3:41:37.600 --> 3:41:40.560]  what you know is the federal reserve involved
[3:41:40.560 --> 3:41:43.680]  in greece well we know they gave the money to goldman sacks and we know they
[3:41:43.680 --> 3:41:45.360]  are involved
[3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:49.360]  now he used the word bizarre so he was accused of me of being bizarre which
[3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:54.320]  means anybody who agrees with my concerns uh... are considered bizarre as
[3:41:54.320 --> 3:41:57.520]  well and you're right in commenting about what
[3:41:57.520 --> 3:42:01.120]  barney frank said at the end uh... i have to end of my questioning that we
[3:42:01.120 --> 3:42:02.240]  should look into it
[3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:05.200]  and to his credit he has sent a letter
[3:42:05.200 --> 3:42:09.680]  uh... to the chairman uh... bernanke and carbon copy me
[3:42:09.680 --> 3:42:14.880]  and he's insisting that uh... it's it's that the federal reserve respond to my
[3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:16.000]  charges
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:22.080]  look into it he asked bernanke to contact my office to go over the details
[3:42:22.080 --> 3:42:27.280]  of the concerns that i've had and uh... and then report back
[3:42:27.280 --> 3:42:30.000]  so barney frank did follow up with a interesting
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:30.640]  way
[3:42:30.640 --> 3:42:33.920]  uh... barney frank was involved with harry gonzalez and you know that harry
[3:42:33.920 --> 3:42:38.320]  gonzalez was against the uh... federal reserve and demanded these uh...
[3:42:38.320 --> 3:42:41.520]  investigations and the gentleman that wrote the book uh... from the
[3:42:41.520 --> 3:42:45.600]  university of texas he he worked with gonzalez and this is
[3:42:45.600 --> 3:42:50.080]  so he has thirsty and information to call this bizarre and it's off the wall
[3:42:50.080 --> 3:42:56.160]  uh... arbok was in the in the trade and uh... in the federal reserve and the
[3:42:56.160 --> 3:42:57.040]  congress
[3:42:57.040 --> 3:42:59.200]  on the banking committee for seventeen years
[3:42:59.200 --> 3:43:02.400]  it was involved in these investigations into just
[3:43:02.400 --> 3:43:06.640]  right as often say this is i've never heard it so you know when he said that
[3:43:06.640 --> 3:43:11.840]  sort of reminded me of about uh... uh... you know the debates uh...
[3:43:11.840 --> 3:43:17.040]  when uh... the mayor uh... you know shouting and i can't believe this
[3:43:17.040 --> 3:43:20.480]  stopping you know uh... what are you saying
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:23.360]  it's incredible uh... we've only got four minutes left with congressman ron
[3:43:23.360 --> 3:43:26.160]  paul we appreciate him joining us live today
[3:43:26.160 --> 3:43:30.080]  the new york times is reporting they may try to revive the carbon tax
[3:43:30.080 --> 3:43:36.240]  with a direct tax on fuel at the refinery senate trio hopes to hit paydirt
[3:43:36.240 --> 3:43:40.720]  with carbon fee at the oil companies request uh...
[3:43:40.720 --> 3:43:44.000]  where is the carbon tax going as well as health care
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:47.600]  well i don't know it's hard for me to believe they'll do that even though
[3:43:47.600 --> 3:43:51.920]  they it's alive and they want to and that's their goal and they will if they
[3:43:51.920 --> 3:43:56.560]  can but under these conditions so bad of an idea
[3:43:56.560 --> 3:43:59.600]  it just blows my mind to think that they'll pursue that
[3:43:59.600 --> 3:44:02.960]  so i don't know that the details on whether that's going to go through or
[3:44:02.960 --> 3:44:06.800]  not but i can guarantee you there's plenty up here who still believe in it
[3:44:06.800 --> 3:44:10.320]  and will pursue it but i hope they come to their senses and
[3:44:10.320 --> 3:44:14.160]  and realize how detrimental it would be there's a mary landrew
[3:44:14.160 --> 3:44:18.480]  quote in here saying we need to pass this this is going to help americans
[3:44:18.480 --> 3:44:22.640]  i mean how bizarre more taxes people are going bankrupt in closing
[3:44:22.640 --> 3:44:26.240]  congressman we've now discovered that an obama
[3:44:26.240 --> 3:44:30.240]  campaign operative has founded a coffee party i actually had this idea with
[3:44:30.240 --> 3:44:33.600]  listeners two months ago to get real constitutionalist to take
[3:44:33.600 --> 3:44:38.720]  the tea parties back from the neocons uh... now it turns out obama picked up
[3:44:38.720 --> 3:44:42.480]  this idea and that his campaign operatives
[3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:46.160]  are now getting all this media attention to tell us to love our federal
[3:44:46.160 --> 3:44:49.920]  government that it's our federal government i mean that shows how powerful
[3:44:49.920 --> 3:44:52.800]  the tea parties are if not just the republican
[3:44:52.800 --> 3:44:56.880]  establishment but now the democrats are flooding in
[3:44:56.880 --> 3:45:02.720]  trying to pose as patriots yeah yeah they want us to love the government how
[3:45:02.720 --> 3:45:06.400]  about loving our country and understanding what freedom is all about
[3:45:06.400 --> 3:45:09.840]  but uh... the battle is out there i mean one thing is is they're starting to
[3:45:09.840 --> 3:45:12.880]  recognize that the battle may be outside of the conventional wisdom of
[3:45:12.880 --> 3:45:15.280]  republicans and democrats that run washington
[3:45:15.280 --> 3:45:20.480]  and actually the discussion going on in the independent tea party type movement
[3:45:20.480 --> 3:45:23.920]  and if the reason to think that everybody is going to believe the
[3:45:23.920 --> 3:45:26.800]  right thing and get together and do the right thing
[3:45:26.800 --> 3:45:31.440]  in those who have who are objecting but anybody who's involved better realize
[3:45:31.440 --> 3:45:34.560]  that uh... if a significant movement uh...
[3:45:34.560 --> 3:45:38.160]  you know erupts like the tea party movement there will be plenty left and
[3:45:38.160 --> 3:45:40.560]  right and everybody else who has a special interest
[3:45:40.560 --> 3:45:42.960]  will want to get in and try to control it
[3:45:42.960 --> 3:45:46.240]  well to see the establishment trying to pose as anti-establishment is truly
[3:45:46.240 --> 3:45:48.720]  sickening but but i mean look at your eighty four percent approval
[3:45:48.720 --> 3:45:51.600]  rating people know the real mccoy one minute left
[3:45:51.600 --> 3:45:54.720]  the economy a lot of top economists are now agreeing with you and others that
[3:45:54.720 --> 3:45:58.960]  we may have a mega depression in the next 16 months and they're positioning
[3:45:58.960 --> 3:46:02.080]  the imf and world bank with a new global constitution
[3:46:02.080 --> 3:46:05.600]  where they will pose as saviors again how concerned are you
[3:46:05.600 --> 3:46:09.040]  that that that that this recession could get a lot worse
[3:46:09.040 --> 3:46:12.000]  well i i think it is going to get a lot worse and uh...
[3:46:12.000 --> 3:46:15.680]  and and what is happening now is wall streets recovered in a few companies
[3:46:15.680 --> 3:46:18.000]  have recovered but the unemployment rate is
[3:46:18.000 --> 3:46:22.880]  is still very high and and getting worse and there will be plans i'm sure
[3:46:22.880 --> 3:46:25.600]  they've been talking about it for quite a few years because those
[3:46:25.600 --> 3:46:29.360]  who run the international banking system know that they're
[3:46:29.360 --> 3:46:33.120]  in trouble so they are laying plans uh... for this
[3:46:33.120 --> 3:46:37.120]  but people do ask me about well do you think this will be on bring uh... bring
[3:46:37.120 --> 3:46:40.720]  on the uh... uh... north american union and uh...
[3:46:40.720 --> 3:46:44.240]  uh... you know north american currency and i really don't think so i think the
[3:46:44.240 --> 3:46:48.000]  bigger concern should be a worldwide currency in the imf and the united
[3:46:48.000 --> 3:46:51.200]  nations grab and hold and try and to dictate to us
[3:46:51.200 --> 3:46:54.400]  but we have economic laws on our side because uh...
[3:46:54.400 --> 3:46:58.000]  you know you can propose these things and even if it does serve the special
[3:46:58.000 --> 3:47:01.440]  interest if it violates economic law it won't work so
[3:47:01.440 --> 3:47:05.200]  they can't maintain a good currency and that's why i think the european union
[3:47:05.200 --> 3:47:08.960]  is very very fragile not only the euro but the union as well
[3:47:08.960 --> 3:47:12.160]  because it's artificial and i think that's what would happen on a
[3:47:12.160 --> 3:47:16.320]  on a world government in a world currency but in the meantime
[3:47:16.320 --> 3:47:20.640]  it could be getting to get pretty messy and they're going to work very hard
[3:47:20.640 --> 3:47:24.480]  uh... to get organized which means they'll work hard to undermine our
[3:47:24.480 --> 3:47:28.960]  personal liberties all right that's uh... most of the interview i did with
[3:47:28.960 --> 3:47:33.840]  ron paul live earlier but uh... he wasn't with us for 30 minutes but a
[3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:37.280]  vote came up so i went live right at the start of the hour
[3:47:37.280 --> 3:47:39.840]  in the first five minutes and i know some stations don't carry that and he
[3:47:39.840 --> 3:47:42.560]  talked about such incredibly weighty issues
[3:47:42.560 --> 3:47:47.200]  that i wanted to go back over that i have articles here where germany that
[3:47:47.200 --> 3:47:51.200]  pretty much runs the e you uh... is saying we're not going to help
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:55.520]  greece with any other loans now goldman sacks goes in they're the key
[3:47:55.520 --> 3:47:59.440]  manager for the private central banks a decade ago
[3:47:59.440 --> 3:48:04.160]  and they tell greece how to create a double set of books this is now even in
[3:48:04.160 --> 3:48:08.400]  royers they tell them how to invest in derivatives
[3:48:08.400 --> 3:48:12.480]  which internal documents that came out last year in the classy news service
[3:48:12.480 --> 3:48:16.800]  prove they premeditatedly did it here in iceland and greece and spain and a
[3:48:16.800 --> 3:48:20.480]  bunch of other nations it's the same thing the imf and world bank do
[3:48:20.480 --> 3:48:24.320]  as the holding companies for these private brokerage firms and banks
[3:48:24.320 --> 3:48:28.480]  in the third world in the last hundred and fifty years they go in they give the
[3:48:28.480 --> 3:48:33.040]  government a bunch of money at thirty forty percent compounding interest
[3:48:33.040 --> 3:48:36.880]  and they tell them in internal agreements that have come out don't pay this back
[3:48:36.880 --> 3:48:39.920]  and then you're going to give us your water your roads your infrastructures
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:43.680]  your government and then it doesn't matter who gets in office after that
[3:48:43.680 --> 3:48:47.440]  or or if it's a dictator or whatever the case is
[3:48:47.440 --> 3:48:52.400]  the banks now run it and they do this out of fiat money backed up by us and
[3:48:52.400 --> 3:48:57.040]  european taxpayer money now this new banking system that they're setting up
[3:48:57.040 --> 3:49:00.960]  this bank of the world this new constitution oven by the banks
[3:49:00.960 --> 3:49:04.080]  they will break their bonds with even western governments who they're now
[3:49:04.080 --> 3:49:07.680]  imploding like third world nations and issue their own
[3:49:07.680 --> 3:49:11.200]  global back currency she'll still have a euro still have a dollar still have a
[3:49:11.200 --> 3:49:15.760]  yen a yarn but globally this private banking cartel will set
[3:49:15.760 --> 3:49:20.080]  the value of those currencies then they can play them off against each other
[3:49:20.080 --> 3:49:24.080]  and their own internal documents show came out in 2002 imf world bank
[3:49:24.080 --> 3:49:27.840]  documents got leaked when sticklets left noble prize winner
[3:49:27.840 --> 3:49:31.680]  that economist world bank was an imf the point is
[3:49:31.680 --> 3:49:34.400]  documents from both banks talking to each other came out
[3:49:34.400 --> 3:49:38.720]  look up sticklets he was imf chief chief economist wasn't it
[3:49:38.720 --> 3:49:43.040]  point is that it came out
[3:49:43.040 --> 3:49:46.240]  that it was all premeditated and they set this up in third world countries
[3:49:46.240 --> 3:49:50.080]  and we're now planning to do it in the west in iceland
[3:49:50.080 --> 3:49:56.320]  they claim they owe 10 times or more the entire gdp and wealth of the nation
[3:49:56.320 --> 3:49:59.600]  then iceland said no the bankers said oh wait a minute
[3:49:59.600 --> 3:50:02.880]  don't kick us completely out after we threatened you and threatened to use
[3:50:02.880 --> 3:50:06.240]  anti-terror laws on you internationally to put sanctions on you
[3:50:06.240 --> 3:50:09.360]  guess what it turns out our banks have assets in your country already that'll
[3:50:09.360 --> 3:50:13.520]  pay this off well when greece went under by
[3:50:13.520 --> 3:50:17.040]  design they openly put in as their new environment
