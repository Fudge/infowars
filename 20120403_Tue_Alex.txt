[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:34.800]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.800 --> 00:40.160]  of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line lay down GI lay down GI we
[00:40.160 --> 00:44.240]  saw it all through the 20th century and now in the 21st century it's time to stand
[00:44.240 --> 00:48.000]  up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat
[00:48.000 --> 00:55.960]  maze we should not submit to dehumanization I'm concerned with the
[00:55.960 --> 01:00.240]  structure I'm concerned with the systems of control those that control my life
[01:00.240 --> 01:27.840]  we have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale start
[01:27.840 --> 01:31.800]  challenging this corporate slave state the 21st century going to be a new
[01:31.800 --> 01:44.640]  century not the century of slavery not the century of lies standing up for
[01:44.640 --> 01:56.800]  something pure and something right management teams ready for control the
[01:56.800 --> 02:03.080]  CEO job the truth is out there in front of you but they lay off this buffet of
[02:03.080 --> 02:09.680]  lies I'm sick of it and I'm not gonna take a bite out of it do you got me
[02:10.840 --> 02:15.600]  humankind is too good we're not a bunch of underachievers we're gonna stand up
[02:15.600 --> 02:19.240]  and we're gonna be human beings
[02:19.240 --> 02:24.520]  the things that matter creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to
[02:24.520 --> 02:32.680]  submit well that's it that's all I got to say it's in your court and I owe that
[02:32.680 --> 02:37.360]  great opportunity to be in the film waking life to Tommy Pilata the
[02:37.360 --> 02:41.640]  producer of the film and Richard link letter two guys that I've gotten so busy
[02:41.640 --> 02:46.400]  over the years and ever even get to reach out to and contact by the way
[02:46.400 --> 02:50.120]  remind me to try to call Tommy Pilata on those numbers we have again today
[02:50.120 --> 02:55.560]  because the number I have for him is an old number and Tommy called me the last
[02:55.560 --> 02:59.560]  time I talked to him about three four months ago I was in a UFC fight because
[02:59.560 --> 03:05.520]  Joe Rogan invited me down to Houston and well I was already in Houston
[03:05.520 --> 03:09.320]  protesting the Fed and Joe had heard that so he invited me over to the UFC and
[03:09.320 --> 03:17.040]  Tommy called me while I was in the middle of watching the fights and he
[03:17.040 --> 03:20.680]  could barely hear me so I haven't talked to him then I'm not name-dropping I'm
[03:20.680 --> 03:24.440]  done like now communicating with my old friends via the radio show as I know he
[03:24.440 --> 03:29.480]  listens sometimes and his friends do so Tommy I think about you all the time and
[03:29.480 --> 03:34.120]  I bet even came to South West and I always miss his phone calls or don't
[03:34.120 --> 03:37.920]  call me back the few times he's called so now I'll just communicate to you here
[03:37.920 --> 03:44.200]  you're awesome what a smart guy to he's an amazing guy so is our Rick link
[03:44.200 --> 03:50.320]  letter that's now what this radio show is turned into is a public communication
[03:50.320 --> 03:55.000]  you know I want to try to break the cycle here on this radio show it's a
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.760]  great radio show very informative but I just don't want to get up here and just
[03:58.760 --> 04:04.520]  bray at people calling the New World Order criminals and calling all the
[04:04.520 --> 04:08.880]  different systems criminal which is true to a great extent but we know that I
[04:08.880 --> 04:15.360]  want to try to have a calm focused reflective show I tried this yesterday
[04:15.360 --> 04:20.160]  and it didn't happen because I got off into brain-altering vaccines that
[04:20.160 --> 04:28.360]  literally attack your tissue and I I dream of actually just calmly covering
[04:28.360 --> 04:32.280]  all the news I dream of actually taking hundreds of your phone calls and I've
[04:32.280 --> 04:37.800]  only attained that dream a few times because I'm always going in the same
[04:37.800 --> 04:44.000]  paradigm so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open the phones up for first-time
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  callers and at least in the first and second hour than everybody in the third
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.640]  hour on any subject any question or comment no matter how good the caller
[04:51.640 --> 04:56.200]  is I'm giving him one minute and then I'm giving myself 30 seconds to respond
[04:56.200 --> 04:58.920]  we're gonna be taking your phone calls when we come back I'll give you the
[04:58.920 --> 05:03.480]  number this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[05:03.480 --> 05:07.840]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:07.840 --> 05:12.000]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.040]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:16.040 --> 05:19.920]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[05:19.920 --> 05:24.200]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:24.200 --> 05:28.360]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:28.360 --> 05:32.680]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:32.680 --> 05:36.360]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[05:36.360 --> 05:40.560]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[08:05.280 --> 08:22.480]  the GCN radio network we are live and transmitting out globally on over 100
[08:22.480 --> 08:29.280]  AM and FM affiliates global shortwave 100,000 wants worldwide WWCR number one
[08:29.280 --> 08:33.720]  on the audio streams and podcasts for talk radio the admitting metrics like
[08:33.720 --> 08:38.920]  shoutcast and others at info wars dot com streaming video at prison planet dot
[08:38.920 --> 08:49.640]  TV and of course channel XM 166 thank you so much for tuning in to this hour of
[08:49.640 --> 08:55.920]  info wars I want to do something a little bit different today and you see
[08:55.920 --> 08:59.440]  me struggle with this every day because there is no program director there is no
[08:59.440 --> 09:05.000]  radio consultant there is no manager over Alex Jones and quite frankly some
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.500]  days I wish there was just because they're there to challenge you and to
[09:09.500 --> 09:14.120]  bounce things off of you and to point out what could be better because some
[09:14.120 --> 09:19.520]  days I hear my radio show rebroadcast and it is the essence of powerful
[09:19.520 --> 09:24.720]  information and oratory skills and the incredible guest and the breaking news
[09:24.720 --> 09:29.640]  there's a reason this broadcast now reaches one way or another over 15
[09:29.640 --> 09:33.440]  million fact I've got a bump that number up conservatively it's more than
[09:33.440 --> 09:40.640]  that 15 million people a week but then I realize wow that's an incredible
[09:40.640 --> 09:47.000]  responsibility and I tend to get frustrated with the information I tend
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.400]  to get angry after I read this stuff all day and all night and finally get on
[09:50.400 --> 09:55.560]  air I get angry and frustrated because there's piles of it and I figured out
[09:55.560 --> 10:04.280]  psychoanalyzing myself that a subconscious level I get so frustrated
[10:04.280 --> 10:12.520]  and angry by the news that then I start to basically spin out of control and
[10:12.520 --> 10:21.360]  just get angry and nasty and you can't argue with success it's just that I
[10:21.360 --> 10:28.000]  personally want to move more towards being calm and focused and really
[10:28.000 --> 10:39.400]  deliberative in what I do instead of sometimes not being as effective because
[10:39.400 --> 10:47.240]  I'm in a rage I knew this was coming for a long time they're launching all
[10:47.240 --> 10:53.280]  sorts of nuclear-powered satellites now that have reactors little systems on
[10:53.280 --> 10:58.560]  board that if they do ever come back into orbit or out of orbit into the
[10:58.560 --> 11:11.320]  atmosphere will will make Chernobyl look like a health food now they're
[11:11.320 --> 11:18.840]  announcing drones to circle 24-7 that are nuclear-powered and you know they're
[11:18.840 --> 11:22.200]  gonna crash you know they're gonna have malfunctions it doesn't matter the
[11:22.200 --> 11:26.720]  system says D use good Chernobyl's good Fukushima's good they actually say
[11:26.720 --> 11:31.720]  yeah I know I talk about this at nauseam because it's total proof of the
[11:31.720 --> 11:36.120]  elite being out of their minds crazy radiation levels are going up
[11:36.120 --> 11:45.360]  everywhere Alaska Hawaii San Diego from Fukushima it's still belching plutonium
[11:45.360 --> 11:49.960]  and uranium out into the atmosphere into the water all coming towards
[11:49.960 --> 11:56.880]  North America and the EPA and FDA just raised the levels last year as you know
[11:56.880 --> 12:02.560]  more than 20 different isotopes in one case they raise an isotope the level
[12:02.560 --> 12:09.760]  they say is safe 100,000 times what they previously said was safe and I know
[12:09.760 --> 12:15.680]  I've talked about that hundreds of times on on air and I've got all this new
[12:15.680 --> 12:21.680]  news but it's just things like that prove how dangerous these people are and
[12:21.680 --> 12:26.460]  now they've got all the quote environmental eugenicists like mom
[12:26.460 --> 12:29.840]  beyond and others in the London Guardian and our own newspapers running around
[12:29.840 --> 12:34.800]  saying nuclear power is the answer and radiation is not bad for us and and
[12:34.800 --> 12:40.600]  culture says it's good for us and and we need to build local nuclear power
[12:40.600 --> 12:58.720]  stations to power all our towns all right it's just seen this reckless desire
[12:58.720 --> 13:03.600]  to hurt the planet and hurt humanity and the people doing it are on a high
[13:03.600 --> 13:08.480]  horse calling themselves conservationist and environmentalist lecturing
[13:08.480 --> 13:14.320]  everyone all day saying pay money to these consortiums these carbon trading
[13:14.320 --> 13:18.440]  companies that are publicly owned by the Rothschilds the Rockefellers Ted
[13:18.440 --> 13:30.200]  Turner Warren Buffett Bill Clinton Al Gore heavily invested Barack Obama to
[13:30.200 --> 13:36.880]  tax us on breathing to tax us on our gasoline our electric power they're
[13:36.880 --> 13:42.120]  setting up a post-industrial world for the general population while building
[13:42.120 --> 13:44.920]  compact
[13:45.640 --> 14:02.680]  reservations of high-tech systems and they're hurting our military letting
[14:02.680 --> 14:17.080]  them use the depleted uranium and they just don't care and so I'm saying what's
[14:17.080 --> 14:22.920]  coming next they know do you use a death sentence a long painful death sentence
[14:22.920 --> 14:29.240]  for a military that uses it not just those that have it used on them the
[14:29.240 --> 14:33.760]  system knows that nine out of ten reactors are leaking because they're
[14:33.760 --> 14:39.320]  old and rotting they just don't care their answer is let them eat cake they
[14:39.320 --> 14:44.680]  put radioactive isotopes in the so-called fluoride compounds mined out
[14:44.680 --> 14:53.120]  of sulfate mines into the water I mean this is so beyond any science fiction
[14:53.120 --> 15:01.280]  movie I could ever imagine and then I see some of the general public and they
[15:01.280 --> 15:08.040]  really think I'm crazy and I guess in a way I am I've used this analogy many
[15:08.040 --> 15:18.920]  times because it's one that's so true if you or I were teleported back a thousand
[15:18.920 --> 15:23.920]  years ago to the heyday of the Aztec Kingdom in central Mexico to where
[15:23.920 --> 15:28.720]  Mexico City is today and they were sacrificing people every hour on the
[15:28.720 --> 15:32.400]  hour sometimes thousands a day shun comes up kill a few people some goes
[15:32.400 --> 15:36.720]  down kill a few people the priest class made their money often hanging the
[15:36.720 --> 15:43.360]  human bodies in the square and selling them for meat if you two other humans
[15:43.360 --> 15:50.160]  if you were to teleport yourself back and you'd studied as an anthropologist the
[15:50.160 --> 15:55.720]  Mayan dialect and you could communicate to that Mayan culture dominated by the
[15:55.720 --> 16:01.360]  Aztecs part of the Mayan culture and you said this is wrong to chop people's
[16:01.360 --> 16:06.960]  hearts out and sell their flesh it's wrong to torture yourselves the priest
[16:06.960 --> 16:10.720]  class on a routine basis would take hallucinogens and take big long pieces
[16:10.720 --> 16:16.040]  of yarn with pieces of glass in it and draw it through their their genitals to
[16:16.040 --> 16:20.640]  have hallucinations of pain worshipping skull and snake gods I mean this is
[16:20.640 --> 16:24.960]  beyond Hellraiser this is real Hellraiser stuff putting hooks in
[16:24.960 --> 16:32.360]  themselves all of this they would look at you and say you are crazy and all of
[16:32.360 --> 16:37.480]  them would laugh at you see so you would be insane if you could teleport
[16:37.480 --> 16:41.680]  yourself back 70-something years to a Nazi extermination camp where they were
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.960]  running people into pits and shooting them and you said don't do that you know
[16:45.960 --> 16:50.040]  if you could speak German don't do that it's wrong to kill these people it's
[16:50.040 --> 16:53.520]  wrong to be shooting women holding babies who you've stripped down naked in
[16:53.520 --> 17:01.240]  these pits they would look at you and just arrest him and kill him and so I'm
[17:01.240 --> 17:08.920]  gonna admit it I am crazy I am compared to the average person you know I talked
[17:08.920 --> 17:14.320]  some about this the other day because one of my employees separate from something
[17:14.320 --> 17:21.200]  going on at my office got picked up in a FBI dragnet because he did some web
[17:21.200 --> 17:25.160]  masterwork for some bar owners and I've started to look at the case like it's
[17:25.160 --> 17:30.960]  all a setup here locally and in the meeting you know it was basically all
[17:30.960 --> 17:37.440]  about how I'm crazy and this is all just my opinion and so they wanted to make it
[17:37.440 --> 17:41.680]  about Alex Jones and I can understand for people like that that would spend
[17:41.680 --> 17:49.560]  eight years or more of college so they could become an FBI agent it doesn't
[17:49.560 --> 17:54.360]  matter if a federal court just ruled yesterday that the FBI is covering up
[17:54.360 --> 17:59.600]  government involvement Oklahoma City I have that in the newspapers out of
[17:59.600 --> 18:07.480]  Salt Lake it doesn't matter if I have their own memos that have been released
[18:07.480 --> 18:13.600]  by courts and that we know that the feds were running those attacks those guys
[18:13.600 --> 18:20.960]  aren't going to ever believe that could be real because that upsets their whole
[18:20.960 --> 18:28.320]  world and that's why corruption can grow to this level is because everybody
[18:28.320 --> 18:32.720]  thinks they've got a stake in the system so they defend it because it couldn't be
[18:32.720 --> 18:39.440]  real really fast and furious couldn't be real all confirmed I told you a year and
[18:39.440 --> 18:43.320]  three months ago that it was about narcotics trafficking and shipping guns
[18:43.320 --> 18:48.360]  into Mexico and the gangs around the US to control the drug crate not about just
[18:48.360 --> 18:52.200]  some guns sold out of some shops to track them that was the cover that's all
[18:52.200 --> 18:55.840]  admitted I told you would be used to blame the Second Amendment because I
[18:55.840 --> 18:59.680]  already had speeches by the Attorney General talking about the program before
[18:59.680 --> 19:03.200]  the full details came out he was just saying oh we got a program to track
[19:03.200 --> 19:07.680]  guns showing that he knew the program was there of course he knew he ordered
[19:07.680 --> 19:13.560]  it's come out but I can see why people like that don't want to admit to it I
[19:13.560 --> 19:18.280]  can see that they just want to say oh that guy's crazy when I have police
[19:18.280 --> 19:26.640]  officers on this show who were at Oklahoma City on record heroes who saw
[19:26.640 --> 19:31.360]  the feds and the bombs and all the rest of it and had the FBI come to their
[19:31.360 --> 19:38.640]  offices and say you and your wife are dead if you ever talk about what you saw
[19:38.640 --> 19:43.160]  I could see how little junior FBI agents that are part of the compartmentalized
[19:43.160 --> 19:50.840]  system sit here and think I'm crazy and they won't even go look up what I said
[19:50.840 --> 19:55.000]  then you have Treasury agents like Joe Bannister who finds out the IRS's
[19:55.000 --> 19:59.000]  collection agency for the private Federal Reserve he started speaking out so

[24:34.440 --> 24:38.360]  let me just read over some of the news we're going to be covering today though
[24:38.360 --> 24:43.120]  after we get to a bunch of calls and all the issues and items that callers will
[24:43.120 --> 24:49.880]  bring up there is a powerful article written by Paul Craig Roberts empires
[24:49.880 --> 24:57.000]  then and now examples of how empires have fallen we also have next phase of the
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.400]  surveillance state nuclear powered drones that's from info wars.com the
[25:02.400 --> 25:07.560]  Guardian also reports us draws up plans for nuclear drones technology is
[25:07.560 --> 25:11.880]  designed to increase flying time from days to months along with power
[25:11.880 --> 25:18.400]  available for weapons systems lasers they don't want to just use the big
[25:18.400 --> 25:23.440]  blimps they're using solar and then storing it on batteries for these
[25:23.440 --> 25:28.720]  weapons system this is about playing God and remember who owns and runs it J.P.
[25:28.720 --> 25:33.120]  Morgan Chase is at the very top of the pyramid Rothschild Rockefeller owned on
[25:33.120 --> 25:39.440]  record and they ordered Corzine to give him a couple billion of private bank
[25:39.440 --> 25:43.760]  accounts and that's why the system has it indicted Corzine who's been caught
[25:43.760 --> 25:48.000]  lying and caught ordering it I mean it's public that he ordered it there's
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.520]  witnesses the head of these securities in exchange you know commission all these
[25:53.520 --> 25:57.720]  people publicly have worked for Corzine in the past it's total conflict of
[25:57.720 --> 26:02.280]  interest crime right out in the open the head of the CME group has come out and
[26:02.280 --> 26:05.760]  said of course Corzine ordered it his people were there and witnessed him
[26:05.760 --> 26:11.040]  ordering it and he hasn't gotten trouble now he might end up dying or he might
[26:11.040 --> 26:15.880]  end up doing a deal to serve a few years as the scapegoat but as Max Kaiser
[26:15.880 --> 26:18.320]  pointed out
[26:21.200 --> 26:28.800]  this is J.P. Morgan Chase that gave the order and that's why nothing's happened
[26:28.800 --> 26:32.960]  because they're above the law so I go from nuclear powered drones to these
[26:32.960 --> 26:37.840]  people because that's who's running it people like John Corzine who make 40 to
[26:37.840 --> 26:43.400]  one bets the people's private bank accounts and then is ordered by the
[26:43.400 --> 26:51.960]  mafia Don the head of J.P. Morgan Chase to get the money or else and does it and
[26:51.960 --> 26:58.880]  then no one gets in trouble and that's why you're seeing the elite get crazy and
[26:58.880 --> 27:05.240]  say well put little nuclear power plants in aircraft put them in satellites and
[27:05.240 --> 27:09.400]  all the scientists say but if that ever comes back into the atmosphere which
[27:09.400 --> 27:13.840]  most satellites do it's gonna melt down explode and rain down radioactive debris
[27:13.840 --> 27:17.880]  and they're like radiation is good for you
[27:20.320 --> 27:24.120]  I mean I don't believe David Ike that some of the ruling elite I mean I
[27:24.120 --> 27:29.720]  understand he believes it I think he's a good guy but I don't believe that that
[27:29.720 --> 27:32.720]  they are really you know the shape-shifting interdimensional creatures
[27:32.720 --> 27:36.440]  you know the Bible says you know demons and devils are at the top of the hierarchy
[27:36.440 --> 27:40.880]  so so I could see that you know religions have said this to a lot of the elite
[27:40.880 --> 27:46.160]  believe that that's what my secrets of Prometheus film leaked breaks down
[27:46.160 --> 27:51.960]  perhaps I'll cover it more later if I have time but at a certain point it would
[27:51.960 --> 27:57.640]  be easier to believe that off-world creatures that love GMO and love
[27:57.640 --> 28:03.040]  radiation were doing this because the radiation levels doubled during nuclear
[28:03.040 --> 28:07.800]  testing and Chernobyl in the northern hemisphere of the earth and now they've
[28:07.800 --> 28:15.440]  more than doubled again and cancer is just off the chart I mean we're dying I
[28:15.440 --> 28:19.960]  think in the final equation that's what I'm here to tell you we're being slow
[28:19.960 --> 28:26.920]  killed right now the numbers are all there it's a hundred percent fact and
[28:26.920 --> 28:32.080]  I'm not in some type of hate fest with even the minions of this system because
[28:32.080 --> 28:35.800]  they don't know what they're doing it's like Christ said forgive them father they
[28:35.800 --> 28:42.360]  know not what they do I know that if the minions of this system knew what they
[28:42.360 --> 28:47.760]  were part of there's no way they go along with this they're wrecking this
[28:47.760 --> 28:51.960]  beautiful wonderful world we've got there's so much beauty so much innocence
[28:51.960 --> 28:55.760]  so much good in the world people always say why don't you be more positive
[28:55.760 --> 29:00.480]  there's a lot of good stuff in this world you know you got it good Alex yeah
[29:00.480 --> 29:05.080]  I know I got it good because my forebears demanded liberty and freedom they
[29:05.080 --> 29:09.040]  weren't perfect but they demanded liberty and freedom and so it created all
[29:09.040 --> 29:15.760]  this prosperity I'm trying to keep it good and the evil is growing and growing
[29:15.760 --> 29:25.600]  and growing and growing like a cancer and I just want people to recognize it
[29:25.600 --> 29:30.680]  and to stand against it that's all I'm trying to do and I don't even think I
[29:30.680 --> 29:34.480]  do the best job just let me be clear about that but this is about what are
[29:34.480 --> 29:42.000]  you going to do this is about what are you going to stand for because because
[29:42.000 --> 29:45.880]  we're in a time of great danger all right your calls straight ahead on the

[31:00.400 --> 31:04.960]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[31:04.960 --> 31:08.720]  pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[31:08.720 --> 31:12.800]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[31:12.800 --> 31:16.240]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[31:16.240 --> 31:21.000]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[31:21.000 --> 31:25.480]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then

[33:00.360 --> 33:10.760]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:10.760 --> 33:17.920]  all right I've just been ruminating cogitating on air about my personal life
[33:17.920 --> 33:23.040]  because I'm just thinking aloud here and I'm asking you what are you thinking
[33:23.040 --> 33:27.080]  about the future of our society and where it's going you know I mentioned
[33:27.080 --> 33:34.880]  Joe Bannister going to break at the end of the second segment a Treasury
[33:34.880 --> 33:40.240]  agent who found out that the IRS was a collection agency for the private
[33:40.240 --> 33:45.560]  Federal Reserve spoke out against it and they tried to put him in jail for
[33:45.560 --> 33:51.240]  his free speech and then a jury found him not guilty but this is the type of
[33:51.240 --> 33:57.800]  system we're dealing with and the establishment is trying to find more
[33:57.800 --> 34:03.800]  and more bad apples who will selectively enforce laws and then also
[34:03.800 --> 34:09.000]  persecute and go after good people who just get off on what they believe is
[34:09.000 --> 34:17.160]  winning the raw exercise of power I mean I know they're good FBI agents I know
[34:17.160 --> 34:20.040]  they're good Treasury agents I know they're good federal marshals because
[34:20.040 --> 34:25.200]  I've been sent government documents I've been sent things by good people when I
[34:25.200 --> 34:30.200]  talked about Dr. Eric Pionka saying soon the airborne Ebola will be released
[34:30.200 --> 34:34.800]  and 90% will die and he and his family are ready to die and he's over the
[34:34.800 --> 34:39.920]  biology department at UT I said something needs to be done the FBI if you
[34:39.920 --> 34:46.480]  have any decency needs to go talk to him today the FBI went that day within two
[34:46.480 --> 34:51.360]  hours of me saying that on air and questioned Pionka and he so show
[34:51.360 --> 34:56.720]  obviously I know that there are good people in government but I'm telling you
[34:56.720 --> 35:03.960]  I'm telling you this is only gonna get crazier and crazier and crazier until we
[35:03.960 --> 35:08.040]  start to really recognize that serious corruption is above us the reason I
[35:08.040 --> 35:11.480]  mentioned Joe Bannister we didn't have any guests lined up today because I wanted
[35:11.480 --> 35:16.600]  to just take calls and I mentioned Joe Bannister and he called in if it is him
[35:16.600 --> 35:21.720]  I'll recognize his voice instantly and said this is Joe Bannister and in fact I
[35:21.720 --> 35:25.360]  was thinking just last week about trying to get Joe back on I was thinking
[35:25.360 --> 35:28.600]  about some of the guests that you know we had on years ago that we've never had
[35:28.600 --> 35:34.360]  on in a while I guess I had him in studio a few years ago Joe Bannister so I
[35:34.360 --> 35:38.160]  definitely want to get him maybe even on the nightly news tonight if he can do it
[35:38.160 --> 35:43.200]  I've now extended that invitation during the break to him via John up there in
[35:43.200 --> 35:47.160]  Minnesota who takes the calls and relays them down here to Texas so we'll
[35:47.160 --> 35:51.160]  find out if he can do that and then I'll get to Reverend Bruce Robin Sasha
[35:51.160 --> 35:56.360]  Martin and many others that are holding and then I'll get into speaking of
[35:56.360 --> 36:00.120]  selective enforcement judicial watch has gotten documents Department of Homeland
[36:00.120 --> 36:05.440]  Security to grant illegal aliens unlawful presence waivers officially so it's
[36:05.440 --> 36:09.640]  it's it's of it's it's like Obama launching wars without congressional
[36:09.640 --> 36:14.680]  approval or saying he'll kill US citizens if he wants to he says I'll shut
[36:14.680 --> 36:19.120]  down power plants without a law well now they're going to issue the illegal
[36:19.120 --> 36:24.880]  aliens unlawful presence waivers but then deport for no reason people that
[36:24.880 --> 36:30.520]  are here legally and lawfully if they want to see they want all these laws on
[36:30.520 --> 36:35.640]  the books so they can selectively enforce them so we'll be getting into that
[36:35.640 --> 36:39.600]  Supreme Court ruling allows strip search of for any arrest I was talking
[36:39.600 --> 36:44.440]  last night to the crew about people now being arrested for no seatbelt just to
[36:44.440 --> 36:48.120]  get you into the system and I found out two people in my office have been
[36:48.120 --> 36:54.000]  arrested in the last year for not wearing a seatbelt and now you get
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.280]  strip searched and now they're talking about taking blood again the prisons are
[36:58.280 --> 37:04.080]  full of nonviolent people full and then that's why they're releasing the violent
[37:04.080 --> 37:08.360]  offenders did you know if you look at the actuary's a violent offender doesn't
[37:08.360 --> 37:11.320]  spend as much time on average as a nonviolent because they don't make good
[37:11.320 --> 37:15.280]  prisoners they want to put them back out there to cause the crime so the public
[37:15.280 --> 37:20.120]  needs the system but enough for me Joe Bannister we haven't talked in a couple
[37:20.120 --> 37:25.760]  years if this is Joe is that really Joe hey Alex it really is me oh yeah that's
[37:25.760 --> 37:31.480]  you hey buddy how you doing great well you know you probably know I'm a big fan
[37:31.480 --> 37:35.040]  and I listen all the time and I was listening this morning I was actually
[37:35.040 --> 37:39.480]  shaving you know I'm on Pacific time and thought I better clean up for the day
[37:39.480 --> 37:43.640]  and of course I listened to your show and you were talking about the you know
[37:43.640 --> 37:51.400]  disappointment that all these FBI agents and fed you you cause them to have to
[37:51.400 --> 37:57.760]  decide what is true what they do every day for their job and what they're told
[37:57.760 --> 38:02.320]  to do or what the you know what the facts show that you put out every day and
[38:02.320 --> 38:06.160]  I also want to say Alex I've never had a chance to say this but you're the most
[38:06.160 --> 38:11.920]  pro-life person probably on the planet because you look out for the lives of
[38:11.920 --> 38:16.200]  all of us and you know the public probably thinks of a pro-lifer as just
[38:16.200 --> 38:21.200]  someone who's against abortion which you and I both are but you're you're trying
[38:21.200 --> 38:26.240]  to preserve life for everyone no matter what color no matter what age born or
[38:26.240 --> 38:29.920]  unborn and I just want to say that to you well thank you but again all I'm
[38:29.920 --> 38:33.480]  trying to do is just like you're trying to do is we do the moral thing because we
[38:33.480 --> 38:38.440]  love God and that's our conscience but if you analyze it it makes sense if you
[38:38.440 --> 38:41.920]  want everybody to get a fair shake and for there to be real justice and
[38:41.920 --> 38:45.520]  security because you want your children to have a future I mean it's really
[38:45.520 --> 38:50.560]  elementary exactly and I mean that was what motivated me to look into the
[38:50.560 --> 38:55.280]  tax issues and I know that's what motivates you it's really about a care
[38:55.280 --> 38:59.800]  and concern for our own families and realizing that our neighbors and our
[38:59.800 --> 39:04.020]  friends they have families too and it's really all about caring about your
[39:04.020 --> 39:08.520]  fellow man you know loving your neighbor as yourself and I can totally see
[39:08.520 --> 39:13.120]  that in you and I just wish that more law enforcement people and federal
[39:13.120 --> 39:18.640]  agents would recognize that that's the motivation that we have and that's the
[39:18.640 --> 39:23.520]  whole motivation let me ask you a couple questions a every time there's an
[39:23.520 --> 39:30.120]  excuse for the FBI to contact us about death threats on a message board and so
[39:30.120 --> 39:33.520]  they asked me about the Obama deception asked my employees about it and start
[39:33.520 --> 39:38.640]  calling people randomly or one of my crew worked somewhere else where they
[39:38.640 --> 39:42.160]  arrested the owners of a bar and so they call them in and they're asking
[39:42.160 --> 39:47.520]  questions about me I mean should I be concerned about that because I know that
[39:47.520 --> 39:51.960]  and of course you beat them you know with a trial that they trumped up stuff on
[39:51.960 --> 39:55.120]  you a guy with no criminal record exemplary record at the Treasury
[39:55.120 --> 39:58.680]  Department you know an armed agent you know who did the raids and all that I
[39:58.680 --> 40:05.160]  mean they tried to put you under the jail so can you speak to that well
[40:05.160 --> 40:10.840]  there's definitely you know you should be concerned but ultimately I'm sure
[40:10.840 --> 40:15.400]  you're much like me and that you know you your parents raised you to be a good
[40:15.400 --> 40:20.520]  guy and not that we're perfect but you know you you you run every day of your
[40:20.520 --> 40:25.120]  life knowing that God's watching what you're doing and you try to be a moral
[40:25.120 --> 40:29.280]  person so I think in terms of you know that I don't think you have anything to
[40:29.280 --> 40:35.000]  worry about but no exactly I mean I bet I mean specifically you tell folks
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.200]  briefly what happened to you and this was in the San Francisco Chronicle this
[40:38.200 --> 40:42.280]  was on record they've repeatedly tried to put you in jail for your free speech
[40:42.280 --> 40:47.920]  tell folks about that well basically the the criminal part of the trial I had a
[40:47.920 --> 40:53.360]  client who wanted to he already paid his tax income tax money in and he wanted to
[40:53.360 --> 40:58.240]  ask for a refund and so your CPA for those that don't know to interrupt your
[40:58.240 --> 41:05.040]  CPA go ahead actually not anymore thanks to the IRS okay for 15 years but
[41:05.040 --> 41:09.040]  basically this client wanted to wanted to follow the rulebook to ask for his
[41:09.040 --> 41:13.400]  money back and so he asked me well how do I find out where the rulebook is and
[41:13.400 --> 41:20.040]  what are the rules so we followed that rulebook to the letter and the IRS turned
[41:20.040 --> 41:24.600]  that into a conspiracy to defraud the United States of America and claimed
[41:24.600 --> 41:29.920]  that these income tax returns that we filed to start this refund process were
[41:29.920 --> 41:35.000]  false and they turned it into four felony counts that would have put me in
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.680]  prison for probably three to five years well thankfully one of the rights we
[41:39.680 --> 41:44.320]  still have is the right to a jury trial and the government presented all of
[41:44.320 --> 41:49.800]  their evidence and I didn't even testify in the trial there was really no need
[41:49.800 --> 41:54.280]  to because the government couldn't find any evidence that there was you know I
[41:54.280 --> 41:58.960]  had done anything wrong that we didn't follow the IRS rulebook or that we put
[41:58.960 --> 42:03.960]  it in a anything false on these amended tax return and so the jury I find out
[42:03.960 --> 42:07.640]  later after talking to the jury they're looking at each other like why are we
[42:07.640 --> 42:13.520]  here here this this IRS has gone through this big long investigation and they
[42:13.520 --> 42:17.520]  are prosecuting this guy but they have all their star witnesses come up on the
[42:17.520 --> 42:21.240]  witness stand and they can't testify that there was ever any conspiracy that
[42:21.240 --> 42:25.600]  there's anything false on these tax return so it was a big joke but meanwhile
[42:25.600 --> 42:30.720]  they indicted me and wanted to try to put me in prison so basically throwing
[42:30.720 --> 42:35.160]  everything up on the wall and hoping that something stuck and nothing
[42:35.160 --> 42:39.040]  stuck let me bring this up to you because you worked for years with the FBI
[42:39.040 --> 42:42.480]  federal marshals as a Treasury agent you know on these raids these
[42:42.480 --> 42:49.640]  investigations I at my core now know what the term God's fearing is but but
[42:49.640 --> 42:55.680]  but but I mean my conscience if I was setting somebody up who was innocent
[42:55.680 --> 42:59.600]  especially if I knew somebody was a child killer and I set them up I would
[42:59.600 --> 43:05.720]  feel bad and wouldn't do it but setting up innocent people literally sins
[43:05.720 --> 43:14.200]  chills up my spine thinking about it and and I I mean it just sounds like the
[43:14.200 --> 43:20.720]  worst bad luck to use a term that I could imagine I would never do that and
[43:20.720 --> 43:25.400]  then I see all these cases of people being set up them trying to set you up
[43:25.400 --> 43:30.680]  they knew you hadn't done anything I mean how do they sleep at night trying to
[43:30.680 --> 43:37.000]  put people in horrible tuberculosis filled dungeons for no reason well I
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.920]  think laux the biggest problem is that the hierarchy of these agencies okay the
[43:41.920 --> 43:47.360]  actual agents are just working people just like you and me but they need the
[43:47.360 --> 43:50.920]  job and meanwhile the people up the chain of command who are even less
[43:50.920 --> 43:55.920]  accountable are the ones that are willing to do more dirty deeds because
[43:55.920 --> 43:59.080]  they have more to lose at least they think they do they're making you know
[43:59.080 --> 44:04.360]  couple hundred grand a year they're you know big in management they're getting
[44:04.360 --> 44:09.920]  all kinds of perks and when they're told to do something they just do it and
[44:09.920 --> 44:13.920]  again like you mentioned all the time there's so much compartmentalization in
[44:13.920 --> 44:18.480]  the federal government that those who want to orchestrate from the top can
[44:18.480 --> 44:23.320]  make everyone do their little deed and it doesn't seem so dirty to the
[44:23.320 --> 44:27.600]  individual agent but when you put it all together you know they're messing with
[44:27.600 --> 44:32.200]  people's lives and their livelihoods and their freedom sure I mean how did the
[44:32.200 --> 44:35.920]  army and I later learned the guy was with the army have somebody when I'm
[44:35.920 --> 44:40.600]  trying to cover an event in Florida jump out and start lighting fires to blame
[44:40.600 --> 44:44.600]  me for it I mean that shows a level and I had to of course stomp it out and then
[44:44.600 --> 44:48.800]  restrain the person who then ran off into the night Mike Hansen witnessed all
[44:48.800 --> 44:56.520]  of this it just shows a level of craziness in the elite that is getting
[44:56.520 --> 44:59.440]  more and more if you look at the criminology which I know you've studied
[44:59.440 --> 45:03.240]  an example of like serial killers get more and more reckless because they want
[45:03.240 --> 45:08.040]  to be caught at a subconscious level that's why criminals brag but what do
[45:08.040 --> 45:12.240]  you make of the fact that now the choice is getting more and more obvious where
[45:12.240 --> 45:16.600]  Corzine can steal billions of dollars lie in front of Congress be caught red
[45:16.600 --> 45:21.080]  handed in all his memos and orders and wire transfers and doesn't get in
[45:21.080 --> 45:29.120]  trouble prudential form now 13 years and a bunch of other insurance companies
[45:29.120 --> 45:32.480]  takes the death benefits of dead troops when they die because they made a deal
[45:32.480 --> 45:35.280]  with the government so they could do it it's like the government said you know
[45:35.280 --> 45:39.600]  we can steal because they're crooks to you as if that makes it okay and now
[45:39.600 --> 45:45.000]  it's a larger conspiracy now we've got fast and furious which if you actually
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.760]  read the federal court cases where this came out it's government bringing in
[45:48.760 --> 45:55.120]  drugs it's it's guns to gangs in the US not just Mexico gangs in Honduras I
[45:55.120 --> 46:03.120]  mean this is a Iran contra deal now that it's all so obvious what what effect do
[46:03.120 --> 46:06.040]  you think that's having in the federal government is that making just the good
[46:06.040 --> 46:09.960]  people leave show that nothing but bad people then will stay or what's the
[46:09.960 --> 46:14.320]  process is there anything good coming out of this oh I think it's tremendous
[46:14.320 --> 46:18.400]  amount of this we're not seeing it I mean I've been told that the agents that I
[46:18.400 --> 46:24.440]  used to work with agents around the Bay Area you know I was assigned I do have a
[46:24.440 --> 46:29.360]  lot of support but they just don't have the the courage to actually speak up
[46:29.360 --> 46:35.000]  about it and so I think that's at least a step in the right direction I think
[46:35.000 --> 46:43.040]  also that your what you put out is so factual and so real that you know it's
[46:43.040 --> 46:47.840]  it's going to have an effect it's just you're chipping away and you know
[46:47.840 --> 46:51.000]  eventually it's going to take a while for the band to break and the question is
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.400]  you know as you've fed off and this is a sprint to the finish line between the
[46:55.400 --> 46:59.920]  New World Order and you know good good people who just want to be free and
[46:59.920 --> 47:06.640]  who's going to get there first and we need law enforcement people to take
[47:06.640 --> 47:13.640]  those risks and you know risk their life their their sacred honor for these
[47:13.640 --> 47:17.960]  kinds of issues because literally our own lives are at stake I mean when they're
[47:17.960 --> 47:22.320]  poisoning our water they're poisoning our air that affects federal agents or
[47:22.320 --> 47:27.080]  non-federal agents just the same you we can all die of cancer and bone
[47:27.080 --> 47:31.480]  maladies and all kinds of things from the same poison so it's time to wake up
[47:31.480 --> 47:38.120]  and speak up do it in a in a in a prudential way you know have prudence
[47:38.120 --> 47:45.960]  and don't do things half-cocked but nevertheless speak up yeah that's my
[47:45.960 --> 47:51.360]  biggest problem is I do so much media that I do some half-cock stuff and then
[47:51.360 --> 47:53.880]  that's my only frustration and I keep talking about myself because I'm trying
[47:53.880 --> 47:58.960]  to self-analyze and be a better person because the responsibility I have it's
[47:58.960 --> 48:03.240]  just that I can feel it and see it all coming to a head I mean has fast and
[48:03.240 --> 48:08.440]  furious woken up people because I mean I've seen that really wake people up
[48:08.440 --> 48:12.760]  absolutely and I mean you know back in youth course were much more involved in
[48:12.760 --> 48:17.720]  the Waco investigation than I was but I was still a special agent in the IRS and
[48:17.720 --> 48:23.160]  we went to see rules of engagement and I remember going with a few pro-gun
[48:23.160 --> 48:27.760]  friends who still stayed friends with me even though I was an IRS special agent
[48:27.760 --> 48:31.880]  and a handful of IRS special agents we went to this showing of rules of
[48:31.880 --> 48:37.240]  engagement together so even when I was an agent I was awake to what was going
[48:37.240 --> 48:42.560]  on and even trying to awaken others but I know at least one guy in that group who
[48:42.560 --> 48:46.840]  went to see rules of engagement and he's still up in the high upper hierarchy of
[48:46.840 --> 48:53.800]  the IRS CID management so whatever he saw that day he's somehow able to dismiss
[48:53.800 --> 48:58.080]  in his mind and still somehow sleep at night
[48:59.520 --> 49:05.720]  well I'm glad that people are starting to wake up and and what's most important
[49:05.720 --> 49:10.000]  is is that people make a choice and it doesn't mean that everything I say is
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.280]  completely accurate because I make mistakes or that everything anybody says
[49:13.280 --> 49:17.440]  is completely accurate but we know that our basic liberties are being trashed
[49:17.440 --> 49:21.240]  I mean now in England which is just a few years ahead of us they just announced
[49:21.240 --> 49:25.440]  everything is recorded we're listening to everything I mean that's in the news
[49:25.440 --> 49:28.720]  now they went from denying it to yeah we're listening to everything you're
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.800]  doing get used to it we're recording everything and now they're going yeah
[49:32.800 --> 49:36.480]  we're spying on you here and yeah the CIA director says the CIA is
[49:36.480 --> 49:40.680]  domestically operating and that there's you know built-in devices to spy on you
[49:40.680 --> 49:45.840]  in the new clock radios and dishwashers so really what I see is the world is
[49:45.840 --> 49:49.360]  getting its choice right now and the same things that are happening here
[49:49.360 --> 49:53.000]  happening across the globe I'm gonna take a ton of calls coming up in the
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.200]  next segment and throughout the next hour and get into all this news but Joe I

[54:24.040 --> 54:27.000]  phone calls phone calls in the third hour I've got a bunch of special news
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.800]  reports I want to go over and analyze and a lot more but speaking of lawlessness
[54:31.800 --> 54:35.880]  in government guys put that Washington Post back on screen radio listeners if
[54:35.880 --> 54:40.320]  you just type in Homeland Security Department has the lowest morale ever
[54:40.320 --> 54:47.720]  you will get the Washington Post and the headline is low morale at Homeland
[54:47.720 --> 54:51.960]  Security is focus of congressional hearing and that of course is all the
[54:51.960 --> 54:55.360]  agencies that are under Homeland Security and why do they have low morale
[54:55.360 --> 55:02.160]  they're getting record pay because they know this country is falling apart and
[55:02.160 --> 55:06.000]  they know there's corruption going on and they know people like Corzine Obama
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.040]  are above the law illegal aliens are given waivers I remember five years
[55:10.040 --> 55:15.560]  ago Bush was doing this and then Obama continued it that they would do fake
[55:15.560 --> 55:19.520]  raids on meatpacking plants and stuff just to get the fines on the company and
[55:19.520 --> 55:23.640]  arrest the owners and then they would take the illegals to a facility and give
[55:23.640 --> 55:27.640]  them green cards on the spot and in some cases use them for federal
[55:27.640 --> 55:31.480]  construction projects and you know the feds aren't getting in trouble using
[55:31.480 --> 55:38.120]  the illegals and again you cannot have this selective enforcement stuff
[55:39.600 --> 55:45.160]  there it is DHS to grant illegal aliens unlawful presence waivers let's let's go
[55:45.160 --> 55:50.760]  to your phone calls right now Robin and then Reverend and then Sasha Martin we'll

[56:12.640 --> 56:18.760]  there yeah I do about the error don't know um what did to do they exactly mean
[56:18.760 --> 56:23.120]  by that I mean if you say one word they can come after you well that's the kind
[56:23.120 --> 56:26.800]  of crazy stuff in fact guys I had it in yesterday's stack will you reprint me
[56:26.800 --> 56:30.200]  our article by the way got on drudgereport.com so we got a lot of
[56:30.200 --> 56:33.120]  attention we appreciate drudge doing that because it's important obviously I
[56:33.120 --> 56:38.000]  wish the media would report on it Arizona passed a law saying that you can
[56:38.000 --> 56:44.880]  have criminal charges on you of basically stalking and bullying it's a
[56:44.880 --> 56:48.760]  copy of the cyberbullying legislation that the ADL wants that kills the first
[56:48.760 --> 56:55.400]  amendment and it just says cuss words or disparaging remarks I just mentioned
[56:55.400 --> 57:01.160]  the cuss word part of the bill it says disparaging remarks and of course I
[57:01.160 --> 57:05.320]  don't like the troll culture on the internet it's a culture of cowards that
[57:05.320 --> 57:09.120]  ruin the internet where they can act like big men and call people names and
[57:09.120 --> 57:13.520]  say I'm a murderer and all this stuff but that's cuz they're little cowards
[57:13.520 --> 57:18.640]  they never come up and say that to my face okay so you don't want to let them
[57:18.640 --> 57:24.160]  spoil everybody's first amendment and so yes ma'am you can go read the article
[57:24.160 --> 57:30.360]  nmfullwars.com in fact I'll dig up the headline for you here in a moment I
[57:30.360 --> 57:33.800]  can't remember the exact headline and it has a link to the bill and it's
[57:33.800 --> 57:38.200]  basically the cyberbullying act at a state level there it is Arizona passes
[57:38.200 --> 57:41.560]  sweeping internet censorship bill legislation to make it illegal to use
[57:41.560 --> 57:46.000]  offensive language and so not just cuss words it goes on when the language to
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.760]  say disparaging that's what Europe's doing they say well if you you've got
[57:50.760 --> 57:55.600]  free speech but if it hurts someone's feelings well now you're gonna get
[57:55.600 --> 58:01.840]  arrested I mean actually arrest you in Europe Canada is now arresting preachers
[58:01.840 --> 58:06.960]  that read anti-homosexual passages and again whether you're for that or against
[58:06.960 --> 58:11.480]  it it's the it's the free speech that's been guaranteed by Magna Carta 1215

[58:55.960 --> 58:59.920]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the
[58:59.920 --> 59:03.080]  entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to
[59:03.080 --> 59:07.840]  deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario
[59:07.840 --> 59:12.440]  Sephalde and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the

[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:12.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:19.840]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.320]  Alex Jones
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.280]  all right into our number two and I'm glad the last caller brought up this
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.680]  article because later I will get into it more I barely mentioned it yesterday
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:40.640]  and I I did something that I do a lot I apologize for it instead of exaggerating
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.600]  what's going on as people seem to think I do sometimes and certainly that does
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.640]  happen occasionally everybody's guilty of hyperbole normally things are
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:54.800]  worse than I said and reading over the legislation that Arizona passed it
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.600]  doesn't just say cuss words so I've been saying if you cuss online they can
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:03.600]  arrest you that's not what it is it's the cyberbullying act it says any
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:09.920]  offensive language anything disparaging or hurtful I mean just totally
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:14.480]  unconstitutional and let me tell you the Supreme Court throws out Obamacare I
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.120]  get a little more hope they you know they did rule the second amendments of
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:26.240]  individual right but it's a battle of ideas we've got to be out there stating
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.880]  the facts against the lies when these globalists come out and say arrest people
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.320]  that don't agree with global warming being man-made or put us in psychiatric
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.720]  wards shout them down say hey you don't try to arrest me for my speech you're a
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:46.760]  tyrant I want you to have your speech but don't you call for my arrest that's
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:53.560]  that's treasonous that's dangerous that's authoritarian you shut up because
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.480]  let me tell you I'm for all speech until somebody says get rid of somebody's
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.440]  speech so you go ahead you you talk as much as you want but I'm gonna be
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:06.560]  screaming right back in your face Sasha in Nevada you're on the air thanks for
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:12.560]  holding welcome hi Alex okay one minute I'm an old-school hacker I work for
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.120]  Bill Gates I go way way back at all of this stuff and I really enjoy your
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:20.920]  program you educate me every day and I wanted to bring up something you which
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:25.240]  you must know about but and I've sent you multiple messages the and even a
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:30.280]  letter one from the message was titled Google is laughing at you you talk about
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:35.160]  the NDA you talk about Google and Facebook's relationships with the CIA all
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.800]  that kind of stuff Mike Adams had an article about how buying storeable
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:44.040]  foods can put you on a watch list and I just wanted to talk about the problem
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:50.400]  that about this Google analytics and how it's basically Google owns the Internet
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:56.720]  and and how everybody is complicit in this including info wars you guys
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:01.160]  include this Google analytics spyware on your website and I know it provides a
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:06.600]  lot of useful statistics and stuff but it also allows Google to run code on all
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.400]  the users machines which could pretty much do anything including turning on
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:16.920]  your webcam or sure I don't block it look looking at this we choose to attack
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:22.520]  Apple for what it does but I own an iPhone we choose to a sale Google to
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:27.200]  tell them to stop accessing computers without authorization which they've been
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.280]  caught doing I'm no hacker like you I just read what the experts say and and
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:37.240]  and I've had big debates around here we would not be able to it's like we're
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.320]  going into the matrix people say why do you use I'll hold you over because you
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.480]  kind of disagree and I think you're making a pertinent point and and it's a
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:49.960]  decision here either we're gonna be in the matrix and fight in the matrix or I
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.040]  can sit outside the matrix but the people I want to reach aren't in the
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:04:00.040]  matrix you see the point I'm making absolutely that's true and and you have
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:04.080]  to be on the internet and and that's true but I think that I wanted to start a
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:09.760]  movement like I was inspired by one of your callers to put up got everybody to
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:13.720]  get off of the registration service from go daddy because they were supporting
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:19.320]  them so but and this is a I in doing this I wrote a little software product
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:24.800]  to block this and as part of that I researched this and I look and I I went
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:30.120]  ahead and loaded the top one million websites on Alexa and it was shocking to
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.680]  me and this is really blew my mind and I'm in this area stay there I'm gonna
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.520]  give you the floor for a few minutes when we get back to break down how this
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:42.240]  works what's going on and how everybody just gives Google access to their site
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:48.640]  and so then Google is able to basically track and control the web my issue is
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:54.280]  I'm now using the Google system two ways to expose what they're doing but I have
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.080]  to be interfaced with it to do it but but explain to me how I can get around
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:04.360]  that when we come back folks Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.560]  ballooning our gas prices whether you're struggling with food costs which are

[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:19.120]  well so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:28.120]  Austin Texas alex jones it is open phones we are now eight minutes into this second
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:34.360]  hour of worldwide broadcast we're talking to Sasha in Nevada who says he's a
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:39.360]  hacker and wants to point out some of the things that are going on on the
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:43.000]  internet speaking of the internet because callers have been calling in about
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.740]  this we we mentioned this yesterday our article and it got a lot of us
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:53.760]  circulation on the internet Arizona passes sweeping internet censorship bill
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:59.360]  legislation to make it illegal to use offensive language online the state
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:03.960]  legislature of Arizona has passed a bill that vastly broadens telephone
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:08.040]  harassment laws and applies them to the internet and other means of electronic
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:15.640]  communication the law which is being pushed under the guise of an anti-bullying
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:20.120]  campaign would mean that anything communicated or published online that
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.360]  was deemed to be offensive by the state including editorials illustrations and
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:28.880]  even satire could be criminally punished and it's it's passed out of one
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:32.920]  side it hasn't fully passed yet so that's that's good again I tend to
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.880]  condense info down when I'm taking calls or hurry up get to the next person and
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.840]  I was saying it had passed it's only passed one side hasn't passed the full
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:45.960]  legislature the comic book legal defense fund breaks down the Arizona house
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:50.360]  bill two five four nine the bill is sweepingly broad and would make it a
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.280]  crime to communicate via electronic means speech that is intended to annoy
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:10:00.240]  offend harass terrify as well as certain sexual speech because the bill is not
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:05.280]  limited to one to one communications HB two five four nine would apply to the
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.560]  internet as a whole thus criminalizing all manner of writing cartoons and other
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:14.680]  protective material the state finds offensive or annoying so show you go
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:19.080]  to a website and you don't like what you're seeing and you go file something
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:23.160]  and they come after you and it goes on from there and it's it's basically word
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:26.720]  for word I've looked at the bill the cyberbullying act does exactly what
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:30.600]  Congress has been trying to pass every time some poor kid commits suicide because
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:35.280]  people are being mean to him online they say oh we got a criminalized speech
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.800]  for everybody number one why are the parents letting all their kids do this
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:43.560]  why are you letting your children on the internet when they're 12 years old why
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:47.160]  why do you have them in public schools why do you subject them to this dead
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.080]  culture I mean I've said it you'd be better to your kids not even know how to
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:58.720]  read or write but to know how to work on a car or or clean out a garage or paint
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:04.040]  then I mean all these people have college degrees now and they can't even get a
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.240]  job and the illegal aliens are driving around in brand new cars live in nice
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.240]  houses because they know they know what makes money the old carpentry you know
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:15.480]  things like that and I'm not saying college is worthless but it's close to
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:20.720]  worthless with a lot of the different degrees because it costs too much you're
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:26.240]  not gonna get enough money out of that degree because the jobs don't exist
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.880]  because we've been deindustrialized the high-skilled jobs there's maybe a third
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:36.160]  of what there was in the 70s that's a conservative estimate I'm gonna shut up
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:42.160]  now it's just all of this ties together now Sasha in Nevada called in during the
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:46.120]  last segment if you missed it and just recap that so you're a good you know a
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:50.520]  great computer person work for Bill Gates and you're pointing out that Google
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.160]  is laughing at us and you've sent us articles about this send it to us again
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:59.360]  and I'll try to do a search on it and maybe even post what you have to say I
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:06.000]  know what you're saying is true and I was explaining why we use Google
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.040]  analytics and things it's because we can interface with the matrix just like I
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:14.480]  said I use an iPhone but I talk about how they should change their labor
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.680]  practices and and pay people enough so they don't commit suicide and they now
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:25.120]  are doing that so all of this tech is built the same way all of it is immoral
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:32.520]  so I use it as a hypocrite but the excuse is I can shoot videos on that
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:37.440]  driving down the road that'll be seen by a million people or more
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:42.240]  criticizing it and pointing out by the way I'm using an iPhone I'm a hypocrite
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.440]  but by the way they should charge it you know five dollars more for an iPhone
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:50.680]  and and that would actually raise those people standard living but the globalist
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:58.600]  don't want that I mean Al Gore runs Apple what do you expect he's a monstrous
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.720]  person he owns oil companies that literally are the number one company
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.560]  chopping down rainforest on record
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:09.360]  Occidental just just vicious and then lectures you all day to pay him carbon
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:14.160]  tax money through his carbon consortium I see idiots send me emails they go
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:21.040]  or comments all the time oh we'll pay our tech carbon taxes to Al Gore oh yeah you
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:25.840]  are ignorant see people realize that's crazy to pay Al Gore money so it's like
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:29.440]  oh that can't be true that that he doesn't run an oil company oh actually
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:35.720]  he does wow Alex is right oh he you don't pay your carbon taxes to him yeah
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:41.120]  you do the Chicago exchange he's a big part of that a gore in blood I'm not
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:46.760]  joking it's called gore and blood or is it blood and gore no it's gore and blood
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:51.600]  guys Google gore and blood carbon trading London England it's the big
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.280]  exchange the Rothschild front in the city of London London is called gore and
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:02.280]  blood that's his company I'm not it's not a pun gore and blood blood and gore
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:09.120]  it's called blood and gore or gore and blood it's it's it's it's gore and blood
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.080]  carbon trading it's a big it's a big company and they make you buy it I mean
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:18.120]  you literally pay him that money side issue the caller is bringing up a very
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:24.480]  central point and we've had debates about it for a while I just had Google
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.760]  turned on in the back end they couldn't track everything my IT folks told me with
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.600]  that but that way I could see what we're reaching and what we're doing very
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:36.120]  valuable information but when you go to the Oracle and tell it what you want to
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:40.040]  know it now knows what you are thinking and it's the same thing it's like in
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:46.920]  Lord of the Rings I love to use it as an analogy where you know there's an
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:50.840]  article blood and gore the nickname for Al Gore's carbon trading firm that is
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.760]  poised to make billions of dollars from carbon credits and again that it's the
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:58.680]  nickname because the principle is what Lord blood and then Al Gore you can look
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:03.560]  it up side issue continuing here I'm actually find their website is what I'm
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:09.000]  saying that Gandalf's telling them don't look into that crystal they're like but
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.360]  I can see what's going on in faraway lands and he said yeah but but Soran or
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:20.120]  Soraman can also look right back through you never know who's watching throw the
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:24.280]  throw the bag over it people he's come to my house over a decade ago and laugh
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:28.080]  at me that I'd cover up cameras on computers and stuff and they're like
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:32.240]  oh they're watching you now they admit they are so I get what the caller is
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:38.480]  saying it's just that then you should turn Google cookies off which I do at my
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:42.760]  house and then Google got caught breaking through those so does Microsoft I
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:49.560]  know so you can either unplug from it all or use it to crush the enemy I believe
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:54.240]  that we see this these things go two ways you understand that now I'm can
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:57.920]  barely turn a computer on I just read what all the experts say correct me if
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:02.400]  I'm wrong Sasha and tell us your big idea on a piece of code you've written
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.080]  and then others can write similar code that can really expose these people you
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:10.440]  got the floor go ahead okay before that I'm just gonna spend 30 seconds and I
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:15.880]  didn't mean to beat you up on this I need to hold on hold on I need to be
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:20.640]  beat up because but but I need to be beat up so I can show and and say where I
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.640]  stand on this because we've had these discussions no one's just ever brought
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.880]  it up to me so I want you to know where I stand part of total transparency but
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:33.480]  go ahead let me take another example let's say you go to Al Jazeera dot com
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:39.000]  and who's operated by a foreign group and so forth you go there and you're
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.120]  reading an article about US government spying well the fact is is that on that
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:47.480]  article there on Al Jazeera they're including Google Facebook and Twitter
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:51.120]  code on there now it can be implemented in different ways but the way that it
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.400]  works that that where people commonly put the Facebook like button on their
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:00.880]  pages they include a block of code from Facebook that draws that button or that
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:05.280]  block of code that draws that button also goes ahead and communicates all
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.240]  your personal information the fact that you've read there even can log your key
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.480]  strokes and turn on your camera and all that that you said well actually the
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:17.080]  Facebook one can't but the Google one can and but and let's then back to your
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:21.600]  your site that you include Google analytics and yes that's a lot of useful
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.760]  information but I would argue that that's not necessary at all for your end
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:30.680]  users and if you just didn't include that code you're complicit in running this
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.600]  code for Google if this code wasn't on your site then it wouldn't be able to
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:39.760]  be tracked and you were saying you did you know the top sites on Alexa and found
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:44.480]  most of them have it right I took when loaded one million websites I know it's
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.760]  the largest study to date I know that the largest study beyond that and I'll
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.160]  write an article to that for that I'm probably it'll be in the Wall Street
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.320]  Journal be great if you guys could write the article like I'll send you all the
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:58.320]  data but I loaded the top one million websites and of those one million
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.080]  websites seven hundred thousand of the top one million websites are including
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:08.800]  Google analytics or some or maybe 75% of them are including Google Facebook or
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:13.960]  Twitter all three of the code that they run for other people and I would say
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:17.800]  that the solution is for there's the solution for the end user and there's
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:22.600]  a solution for the webmaster I was thinking about more of a the webmaster
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:28.120]  side the solution for the end user is there are solutions none of them really
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:33.600]  completely work but listen we've tried that's what I'm saying they've built the
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:37.880]  architecture where you pretty much need this so explain to me how we do it
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:43.920]  without it and can still interface and effectively fight the globalist explain
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.520]  how we do that and we will do it yeah I mean you've got my absolute you know
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:53.600]  word on that if if we can find a solution we are waging war against these
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.560]  people we're exposing them I know what you're saying I understand what you're
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:02.640]  saying it's just that take the ad company we were using for the software to
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:08.280]  display ads Google then bought that I mean the problem is many times we're
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:12.720]  using something that isn't spying on people and Google comes and buys it so
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:16.680]  it's like whack-a-mole and and and I don't have that much money I don't have
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:21.480]  that big of an IT team and and so we're just constantly just trying to keep the
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:28.600]  sites up and working and it's all a process but I I absolutely hear what
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:34.720]  you're saying okay yeah I and I I hear what you're saying too specifically to
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:38.760]  Google analytics it would take more work but you don't need to run it you can get
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:43.240]  those same statistics without it as far as YouTube and using YouTube yes go
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:47.040]  ahead and use it that's a great using their tool against them and that's the
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:51.680]  best way to get the information out there as far as the Facebook button well
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.680]  hold on stay there we're gonna have to come back and I'll get to other
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:57.240]  collars but I want you to finish up you said you have a plan you have a piece
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:02.000]  of software I want to hear about that stay there I've seen the Ungevity
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.600]  products work for many others and so I bought a bunch of them started using them
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:09.800]  had a little bit of results but I wasn't following the regimen every day but
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:14.640]  Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds when I saw those
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.760]  results I said I better follow my own advice I started taking the Ungevity
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:24.400]  products and it's been incredible 37 pounds in two months our bodies are

[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:23.760]  stuff he's up to and I've gotten a pretty good gauge on callers over the
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.800]  years he sounds like a pretty credible guy and he's doing he's certainly doing
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:31.640]  some pretty interesting stuff let me tell you the really good computer
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:35.720]  programmers hackers out there are one of the best things we've got going for
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:38.760]  us and most of them love liberty because when you're intelligent you love
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:42.240]  liberty that's that's that's that's one of the prerequisites of course there's
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.640]  evil people that who are also intelligent but that's a minority it's just good
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:51.800]  people send to never to never actually stand up to the corrupt and it's only
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:56.440]  when we actually see it as our job to stand up and crush the corrupt that we
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:01.480]  start real seeing real movement and the the globalist or experts and also
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:06.800]  co-opting people that are intelligent but but finishing up your point in the
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.320]  next few days you're gonna send me this article that you're putting together and
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:14.520]  we'll we'll put it on info wars com after we you know go over it some finish
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:18.640]  up any other points you wanted to make no that's great Alex the only thing I
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:23.920]  would say is that one of the things I'm a little disheartened about is that it
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:29.400]  seems that with the fact that Google has you know basically got their code on
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:34.360]  every single website so it doesn't matter what what article you're reading on
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:38.400]  website it's there I think what the real solution is is that at some point
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:44.960]  somebody needs to form another internet a second internet one that's kind of it
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:48.400]  could run on top of the current internet because if somebody pulls a plug on the
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:54.040]  internet it's the information sources like yours and so forth to just be turned
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:59.560]  off overnight and I know that you know you worry about these things too and so
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:04.760]  there needs to be another solution so that you know we have some like CB radio
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:09.200]  sideband equivalent of an internet so that the information can still get out
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:13.280]  if it gets to that point sure well Google is clearly a government
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:17.720]  construction an elitist construction now at the Bilderberg group Google is right
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:20.640]  up there at the top because they understand that they're taking over the
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:25.480]  entire economy and infrastructure with a system with built-in backdoors
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:31.120]  and Trojan horses to absolutely control all information and as Google now
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:37.400]  admits try to predict the future so this is a an attempt to create an
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:43.080]  information singularity or an omnipresent awareness or at least a
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:48.440]  dim a counterfeit of that and it's very very serious look forward to that email
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:53.880]  thank you so much okay now I will try to hurry through calls it's just that these
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:57.800]  callers are always so good we got a bunch of news coming up to Reverend Bruce in
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:04.800]  New York welcome to the airwaves finally God bless you I have a couple of
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:08.000]  comments to make about Obama's background and then I want to briefly ask
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.200]  you about the Bilderberg meeting but before that I just want to say at the
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:16.520]  end of the day I don't care what the devil is doing what his people are doing
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:23.440]  God has the last say and he is in control and on that note concerning
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:29.000]  Obama's background prior to Obama being elected to office I don't remember the
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.280]  gentleman's name he was being interviewed and he had a lot of information on
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:38.240]  Obama he did a great amount of investigation that's one of the reasons
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:43.320]  why I didn't vote for Obama what he had said was concerning Obama's family in
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:48.400]  Kenya that they had a background that were originally Arabs they were Arabs
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:55.600]  they came into Kenya and they held the current government hijacked took over the
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:59.600]  Kenyan government no that's Webster Tarpley and he's written two books on
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:06.080]  Obama that's all true that's all true about Obama and Odinga and they used a
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:11.000]  Muslim Christian war to get Odinga in a new position they created the prime
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.560]  ministership and so yes that's that's what Obama did
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:21.760]  not only that Michelle encouraged Obama to become a Christian so he would be
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:27.040]  more electable to become president or to get into office so he was not a
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:35.080]  Christian he became a Christian just for electability also there was an article
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:43.840]  online that a gentleman wrote who went to a a dinner a supper over in in Russia
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:49.480]  and there was a woman who was a communist that told him all about Obama
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:56.000]  his rearing and who he would be back in the 80s she educated him on this black
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.080]  man who would run and become president that he is a communist and they're
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:06.080]  waiting for him and she gave a whole lot of details about Obama and how he was
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:12.520]  raised to be president and he was also a communist he wrote a whole article I
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:16.200]  have that on my desktop if you want I could email that article sure sure when
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:24.640]  I think it's going on with Obama is he's like a multifaceted shape shifter
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:29.520]  politically he's all those things and has all those backgrounds but he has CIA
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:34.400]  from the time he's born in his background so the truth is we don't know
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:40.440]  who Obama is we only know that he's not who he says he is that that's a hundred
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:45.240]  percent he's got three or four different names his records are all blocked he is
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:51.680]  not who he says he is his official story is a lie we're on the March the

[01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:02.600]  and then I'm gonna go back to your phone calls Martin Kevin Brad Paul Patrick
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:06.960]  and others that are patiently holding we'll go to Martin first here in just a
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:13.560]  few minutes here is some of the other news that we've got Supreme Court ruling
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:21.800]  allows strip searches for any arrest and they're saying that yes if you get
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:27.800]  arrested for any reason it allows a strip search which includes I guess a
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:36.560]  cavity search and it implies that everyone should be stripped searched so now
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:40.880]  even when you go into a custodial arrest like your your mom gets arrested for a
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.760]  warrant you're five years old the government takes you you better believe
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:48.520]  the CPS wants to do that strip search because that's why they got into that
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:54.960]  that profession how many TSA workers have now been caught being pedophiles are
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:59.120]  running prostitution rings it's like every day they're so rampant about it
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:03.840]  and they're so open I've seen cases where they rape women in parking lots by the
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:08.840]  way I have some TSA news coming up next so Supreme Court ruling allows strip
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:15.120]  search for any arrest I've been arrested quite a few times demonstrating and
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:22.280]  protesting and the police in New York I don't even think they frisked me I was
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:30.680]  wearing a t-shirt and jeans they told me empty out my pockets I've been frisked
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:34.880]  in the Austin jail a few times but just you know checking but no gonna do the
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:41.040]  strip search gotta enjoy the humiliation I've seen videos online in the jails when
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:45.160]  men are stripping women the women cry they just start beating the daylights
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:49.360]  out of them because again you're gonna get dungeon keeper types who like
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:54.840]  abusing people does that mean all police are like that no but the bad ones get in
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:59.920]  there and they're protected and they're promoted in fact I did nothing at the
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:06.760]  Austin jail in this about four foot nine guy oh maybe he was five feet I'm not
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:10.880]  knocking people that are short I'm only five ten the point is this guy was no
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.640]  way he was above five feet and I say that because I don't remember his name so
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:22.160]  people know he is we still works there he was red hair look he was about 40 I'd
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:29.200]  been arrested protesting the thumb scanning by the state police they were
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:40.640]  friendly took me down there and bring me in and the and little redhead guy tells
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:47.280]  me turn around while he frisked me and start shoving my head not not not super
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:51.320]  hard it was definitely assault banging my head into the cinder block it's like
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:56.640]  get up against that wall just a little I'm a runt wimp and I've got this job so
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:02.560]  I can shove people bigger than me around all day and feel powerful I don't know
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:07.480]  how pathetic I look how pathetic and weak this is and I just felt sorry for
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:12.360]  the guy man you want to work in a jail so you can shove somebody's head in the
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:20.920]  wall didn't smart off didn't say anything just I got arrested to talk about
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:25.480]  biometrics and where all that was going and to warn people about the cashless
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:29.320]  society and how they would shut down garage sales and farmers markets which
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:34.840]  they're now doing harassing lemonade stands I was pointing out that they want
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:38.680]  this cashless society for total control if not a good globalist they just turn
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:43.440]  your thumb print off turn your face can off so I was there for a reason I was
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:50.640]  getting the attention I wanted to the issue and it was on the news you hundreds
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:58.560]  of people showed up for the protest show I was very polite very nice and he
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:03.160]  enjoyed I don't know four or five times running my head into the wall and then he
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:09.280]  was like gonna do something like like a little leprechaun or something even you
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:13.720]  look like a leprechaun and they had red hair look like a leprechaun and I was
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:20.920]  just like okay man whatever you know that's the best you can do great but
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.280]  no they got other dungeon keepers like to strap you down in those chairs the
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:28.000]  rapes that go on the murders that go on there have been a lot of murders in the
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.480]  Travis County lockup so I'm lucky you know they kill quite a few people in
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:34.640]  there it's always an accident there's been a new video out of Chicago where
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:39.520]  they break the guy's neck for no reason and then and then wheeling out on camera
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:44.760]  and nobody got in trouble so they just kill whoever they want so now this
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:51.080]  article opens up a whole another subject and a whole another area because it made
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:56.200]  national news four or five years ago that we had her on the show when a woman
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:01.640]  from Lago Vista stopped at her community outside Austin like a golf course late
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:05.960]  community and it's one of those places where the mailboxes are up on the top
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:12.560]  of the hill and so she got her mail and the kids got out like Mindy sometimes
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:18.280]  as they pull up near the house and they were out of their seatbelts police
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:22.360]  officer pulls her over on record she didn't do anything this was all in the
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:26.920]  newspaper she and she said oh I'm sorry I'm just my house is right there you know
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:32.120]  hundred yards away and he goes you're going to jail takes her to jail they
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:42.800]  call the CPS later her doctor husband the police came to his house and beat
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:48.360]  him up the police drove by it's quasi countryside out there and they were
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:53.400]  burning brush everybody does burning cedar trees and I've had him on the
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:57.000]  show it was on the news we covered the whole thing and so they beat him up and
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.360]  took him to jail it's like once they're gonna start showing you hey we're gonna
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:05.080]  show you cuz he went on national news just five years ago maybe it was six
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:10.680]  years ago guys searched the term under web woman arrested Lago Vista for no
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:15.040]  seatbelt and it'll give me the actual day cuz time just flies it might even
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:20.240]  been like 2004 2005 I can't remember I just get obsessed on mindless factoids
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:28.600]  sorry listeners and now they start strip searching people and this has become a
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:32.840]  big issue in fact in the Supreme Court case they're taking women mainly who've
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:39.120]  never never been touched by another man other than their husband and I mean
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:43.200]  they're they're taking people to jail that don't belong in jail goody two
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:50.480]  shoes old ladies goody two shoes young women pastors of churches I mean you see
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:55.120]  it all the time because the system once they encourage police in many cities now
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:59.960]  to get people booked there's bigger fines fees it gets people in to get their
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:05.160]  fingerprints biometrically this is on record get them in the jail so you've
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:10.760]  got women who have never been in trouble in their life and they're suddenly in a
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:20.960]  holding tank with murderers they are suddenly in these jails with feces on
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:24.920]  the ground snot all over the walls vomit everywhere I've been in quite a few
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:29.800]  jails protesting in fact when I don't want to be arrested for no reason at all
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:33.200]  one time in New York I mean it was like a hundred and plus degrees in there in
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:40.120]  the summer jail guards like out of a movie like Quasimodo or something where
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:43.880]  they're dragging one leg over with the keys in their hand they're like oh you
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:48.280]  like it and standing there with a McDonald's bag and an orange drink next
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:52.600]  to the person going you want food what you gonna do for it what you gonna do
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:56.680]  for it and I was like this is in this is entertaining I might want to stay in
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:05.320]  here I mean to talk about a sociology investigation and then sweetly coming
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:08.160]  back over with the McDonald's because I guess that's what they feed you there
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:12.720]  is they don't have food it's McDonald's and then and then go here the food for
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:17.560]  you like and then the and then the weirdos in the jails going oh thank you I
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:24.000]  mean I was like whoa whoa get me out of here but in a weird way it was like wow
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.960]  I want to stay in here and see what else happens this is bizarre these these
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:33.120]  because it was like some weird nerd who was getting off on people being behind
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:38.480]  bars and they had power and it was guaranteed the guy had an 80 IQ or
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:44.760]  lower like a village idiot walking by with keys dragging them down because it
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:48.720]  had it had old big keys in this old precinct over a hundred-year-old jail
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:53.320]  and he had like this big ring of keys and you see this stuff and it's like
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:57.760]  something out of a movie dragging keys down the side I was only in there two
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:03.040]  hours and like 300 protesters marched you know halfway across the city where
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:07.280]  they took me and stood around chanting and just because the New York police
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:11.160]  were lazy and because the captain got called out when he was asleep was like
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:14.640]  10 o'clock at night he comes and says listen I want to go home and go to bed
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:17.440]  we're just gonna release you you shouldn't have been arrested anyways
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:21.120]  because it was an unarrestable offense it was using a unpermitted sound device
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:25.200]  and he goes but we're gonna crack your heads and it's rock and roll time if
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:28.640]  you don't leave now I was tired and said great nobody know let's not protest
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:31.080]  let's go because the cops are getting their Billy clubs out and wanted to go
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:38.040]  sleep but I'm telling you just incredible laziness and they've got a
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:41.280]  little see I said I'd go to your calls and I'm not start telling stories and
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:46.640]  it just goes forever how did I get into this oh here is we're all being trained
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:53.640]  you see normal hard-working non-criminal class people never experience
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:59.320]  presence never experience jail don't know what it's like and in a way this is
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:03.480]  good because these are the goody tissues that go and sit on these juries when
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:10.000]  there's no evidence or it's a nonviolent crime or marijuana and they love
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.560]  sending people who have got long hair or who are black or Hispanic or whatever
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:20.640]  the case is to jail and it's not even that they're quote racist in their mind
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:24.880]  it's that oh that's a scary person I don't know they must be guilty you know
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:30.120]  it's more of the unknown is scary so in a way this is backfiring having the TSA
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:35.600]  grope people's private parts grope miss USA do all this I talked to the state
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:39.080]  reps that's why they unanimously pass a law short arresting the TSA when they
[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:42.920]  grope but the feds threaten an armed blockade of the airways so they backed
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:48.440]  off cowardly these state reps can't fly anymore these are super clean-cut people
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:55.120]  with you know beautiful wives handsome children and they're watching them get
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:45:01.680]  groped and are freaking out good these globalist social engineers it's gonna
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:07.640]  backfire on all of them you want this tyranny well all of the middle class and
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:13.320]  wealthy people are now having to go through it and so this is gonna backfire
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:18.320]  that the fact that they're now taking women and a lot of times beating them
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:24.560]  to death because the women freak out this is mama's you know this is daddy's
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:28.400]  little girl who always had everything she wanted and gets her nails done once
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:34.200]  a week and goes to church and does bake sales in blue Santa and loves the system
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:39.040]  and oh America land of the free home of the brave who puts little American flags
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:44.360]  out and she gets pulled over by some shaved head tattooed cop the CPS takes
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:51.200]  her kids for no insurance just because she doesn't have the insurance card on
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:59.320]  her or or no seatbelt and she gets to spend the night in there hearing people
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:05.000]  howling and crazy and detoxing and vomiting everywhere she gets to discover
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  in a way I just had an epiphany here this is good this is really good throw all
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.520]  the women in the dungeons with the dungeon keepers let them find out what's
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:17.800]  happened to all the poor people forever see the tyranny this is why it always
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:24.320]  falls it's done eating all the poor people and now it wants everybody now it
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.720]  wants everybody and let me tell you that's when revolution comes we got to
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:33.320]  use that Queens right song I hear on the radio revolution calling you know that
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:42.320]  song because because that is exactly what's going on here so Supreme Court
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:47.600]  ruling allow strip searches for any arrest New York Times every detainee who
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:51.000]  will be admitted to the general population will be required to undergo a
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:58.280]  close visual inspection while undressed justice Kennedy wrote adding that about
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:03.440]  13 million people are admitted each year to the nation's jails yeah we have more
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:07.640]  people in prison than any other country including China in fact we have double
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:13.880]  the number of China double China is 1 billion 300 million and our country has
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:19.160]  double the people in the jail in Williamson County north of where I live
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:23.840]  in Austin they arrest you when a video tape back when they still had video
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:30.560]  stores or CD DVD is two days late you get arrested library books are a week
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:36.720]  late you're arrested I mean you might as well move to Nazi Germany in 1942 to
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:40.080]  live in Williamson County and why is it like that because it's a retirement
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:45.720]  community of totally naive Americans who think this is still 1950 and they
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:49.280]  believe the cops and the system whatever they tell them even though the cops and
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:53.160]  the mayors and all of them in Williamson County it's constantly getting
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:58.000]  caught dealing drugs their wives kids dealing drugs killing people robberies
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.120]  total corruption murdering people in the jails every form of corruption one of
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:09.240]  the worst counties in the country but they all wear suits and ties and are
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:14.080]  white and at conservative so those old people go on those juries and they just
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:18.080]  send everybody straight to jail the feds completely run Williamson County they
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:23.000]  love it it's a complete joke it's come out that prosecutors in Williamson
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.480]  County are famous cases no people are innocent including folks who didn't
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:30.400]  even have criminal records it's one thing if you set up somebody who's got a
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:34.480]  bunch of prior convictions that's evil that's wrong they will send people to
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:39.480]  death row who they know are innocent when they have DNA and witnesses a hundred
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:45.800]  percent they will fight for 20 years to keep somebody on death row and it all
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:49.840]  comes out and the town just goes oh my gosh you put innocent people in and all
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:52.980]  these old people literally fall down on their knees and begin worshiping evil
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:58.480]  I mean they love it it is a sycophantic worship center worshiping injustice
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:03.200]  worshiping corruption worshiping the persecution of innocence and Williamson
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:11.520]  County Texas is the model for this entire country in this entire world and so but
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:16.840]  again they leave the old people alone in Williamson County that's the taxpayers
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:21.000]  that the leeches sit on top of and then anybody else that crosses through there
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:27.520]  is ripped apart by hyena like creatures I mean Williamson County on record will
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:31.560]  pull you over I don't care if you're a 65 year old woman and open your purse and
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:36.880]  you've got prescriptions on the pill bottles and it's heart medication you're
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:44.680]  going to jail I mean because it's a criminal enterprise there are many
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:48.480]  areas in Texas this has even been on national news where the police pull
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:55.120]  people over and openly rob their purse of money and it's almost always old
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:58.880]  women they say why do you have $2,000 well sunny I don't trust banks too much
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:02.520]  I'm going to visit my family or we're taking that and then they have the police
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:08.000]  on CNN defending it no judge no jury no arrests no nothing we're gonna impound
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.960]  your car and take you to jail unless you give us this money and then I'm anti
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:18.560]  police to talk about this here's another one TSA brags about creating
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:29.560]  imperious security team in a job hiring ad they post it and help wanted and it
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:35.920]  is titled domineering in a haughty manner dictatorial overbearing that's
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:41.800]  what imperious means and if they're not imperious I don't know what is imperious
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:47.560]  this is this this whole government foreign bank run is a bunch of imperious
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:54.280]  wannabe bosses wannabe tough guys sucking off the public with a bunch of
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:51:00.280]  naive people groveling to authority America wasn't founded on groveling to
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:05.080]  big government a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:08.560]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:12.880]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:16.240]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:21.480]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements

[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:47.880]  guy I mean it's just it's crazy the type of stuff that's going on or that case
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:51.280]  out in California where the cops beat the homeless got a death for no reason
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:54.520]  and then the surveillance tape got released and the police did get
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:59.560]  indicted well they have to be indicted why would you break the neck and beat
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:04.440]  some homeless guy who didn't do anything I mean if you want to beat people up go

[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:03.960]  space aliens run things I've had Christians saying what you think aliens

[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:33.440]  wouldn't even let him do the the iron-working art he wanted it was
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:38.480]  wasn't even political it's total control over everything sorry go ahead

[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:11.320]  for when you meet people that want it all it'll it'll never be enough but the
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:17.360]  good news is you always have patriots that come up and and or you just change
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:21.920]  your life my dad just ended up moving here using the military there you got
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:28.520]  intel that the Russians were gonna invade to take over their country and he
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:32.880]  got up the night before said he's going to Paris with a friend he is but
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:39.200]  basically it was very bad it was never the same in that country it's much more
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:45.080]  beautiful now that they rebuild but the funny thing is they had to go through so
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:51.360]  much and lose so much over other people that deal I just don't well again the
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:55.400]  ultra-rich Rothschilds always fund communism because they want to destroy
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:59.920]  the middle class and new wealth that creates the wealth they see a lot of
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:05.560]  poor folks to understand this a lot of rich people brings everybody up because
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:09.320]  rich people are going to hire you to do things and you're going to become wealthy
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:14.960]  but when you shut down the rich people it's over but see the notice Warren

[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:24.880]  because they're exempt from taxes they are in tax-free foundations they're
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:29.200]  called philanthropists that that's all a propaganda hoax for them not paying
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:34.440]  taxes they want your money they watch what it's all about shutting down their
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:38.960]  competition and and and telling people everything they've got to do and how
[02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:43.160]  they've got to live I mean people don't understand under communism they tell you
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:47.680]  everything what you can say what you can think what you can do and it's all run
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:52.480]  by gibbering cross-eyed control freaks like the professor that wants to put

[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:44.120]  hear it but you know thank you for everything you do you you are a true
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:48.320]  patriot and thank you just for everything initially I wanted to make in a
[02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:53.000]  statement about that rebound rebound brown case on the Florida but just
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:57.240]  listening to you talk about this police brutality and corruption you know it
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:09:00.760]  happens everywhere and these cops do whatever they want and they get away
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:04.520]  with it and they are like you said harassing old ladies young kids you
[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:08.640]  name it where I live I live in a small town about a year and a half ago this
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:12.120]  cop in the middle of the night was driving he had someone who was suspected
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:16.640]  of the DUI in the backseat and he was driving up the road and the highway
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:19.760]  around a hundred miles an hour because the guy refused the breath pass so he
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:24.640]  was going to take him to get a blood pass at the hospital the cop crashed into
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:29.200]  a truck and hurt the guy the prisoner the so-called prisoner and there's a
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:33.400]  backseat the state police the local police everyone was saying oh this is a
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:38.520]  complete accident the paper said this is horrible but no one question why was
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:43.040]  he going a hundred miles an hour why didn't he have his lights on and then
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:46.920]  about a year later after cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars for him
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:50.600]  to get better and buy a brand-new police car he went back to work in a
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:54.600]  newspaper just said oh you know we're so happy to have them back in back but
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:59.000]  that's like the mentality it's just so pervasive these cops do what they want
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:04.440]  and people don't question well that's it look but a fish rots from the head
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:09.760]  you've got Obama caught in all these crimes giving billions of dollars in
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:14.440]  energy contracts to two people that never even build one machine because
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:18.040]  they're his donors they give him a hundred thousand they get five hundred
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:22.760]  million back literally there's Corzine there is the shutting down the power
[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:28.760]  plants so their competition can't compete there's all of it I mean you just
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:34.120]  start listing all of the crimes and the corruption and the fact that they don't
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:38.160]  even get in trouble now that lets you know that the critical mass is being
[02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:44.200]  reached where there's so many crooks in government that it's a free for all it's
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:50.360]  a total and complete free for all it's like the rock and roll song Ted
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:55.960]  Nugent I got me a rock and roll band it's free for all I mean they are going
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:11:00.560]  crazy but it's not some free for all having fun playing you know guitar it's
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:06.160]  it's it's going crazy on people and this psychosis the tyrants always start
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:10.040]  believing that what they're doing is for the greater good and they're going to
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:15.200]  keep the public in line but I mean take the New York police their union
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:19.080]  repeatedly in the last few years has put full-page ads in local papers New York
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:24.200]  Post and other places saying look we don't want to give old ladies tickets
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:27.640]  for sitting on a bench more than five minutes or a pregnant woman for sitting
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:31.480]  down there's some benches where it's only like five minutes we don't want to
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:35.800]  arrest people for putting cat litter in the trash can we're told to do this and
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:39.960]  that we're told to you know basically double this was a few years ago our
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:45.160]  quota then they lie and say oh there's no quota but it it's now been on record
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:51.480]  in many police departments copies of even memos ordering a quota and so it's
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:55.320]  about revenue generation my point is it's all being siphoned off to the
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:12:01.040]  globalist bankers who sit on top of over a thousand trillion more money than they
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:04.560]  could ever buy everything on the earth over four or five times that's why they
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:08.840]  want to create a depression to make you sell they want it all even though they'll
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:14.680]  never even see it or know it it's just it's they've all all tyrants seek after
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:21.560]  the get out of jail free card the bulletproof card the too big to fail card
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:25.880]  I appreciate what you've said thank you so much and that's what tyranny is it's
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:31.400]  a too big to fail in government and corporate corruption because so many
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:36.640]  people are tied into it that none of them wanted to go down even though it's
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:46.560]  bringing us down you see what I'm saying it's almost like they're standing up on
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:52.000]  a deck of a ship and they're down below knocking holes in it and waters coming
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:57.280]  in and we're saying the captain's crazy he ordered holes being knocked in the
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:05.120]  bottom of the boat but because the officers got his crew the captain has
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:09.000]  his other officers and crew even as the ship's sinking they're like it doesn't
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:16.200]  matter we're up here on the poop deck and we're the bosses you're like but you
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:22.800]  knock holes in the boat doesn't matter where the bosses but you're crazy where
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:28.280]  the bosses it's like that famous newscast where the TSA person's going I
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:34.720]  have power I have power you seen that video multiple times they go crazy and
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:38.840]  announce their God and strip down naked and start running through the airports
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:44.120]  I'm not kidding type in TSA agent runs through airport naked declaring their
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:48.240]  God it's actually happened twice and you're like well how could two people
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:55.360]  what one I think it was in Maryland the other was in LA but one thing was in
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:58.320]  Baltimore the other was in LA I'm going from memory this happened the last few
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:03.400]  years and you're like well why would two separate ones do that because it's a
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:09.840]  certain typecast it's a certain psychological profile that is
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:14.760]  gravitating towards wanting to wear a uniform and wanting a TSA style job I
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:19.800]  mean you think bad people sometimes gravitate towards law enforcement I
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:23.920]  mean you get Dudley do rights that do it as well and they just get compartmentalized
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:27.520]  yeah you go deal with the kidnappings and bank robbers we'll deal with the
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:31.280]  narcotics trafficking wink wink we'll live in the $2 million house and you're
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:35.480]  so dumb you won't ask why we live in that on the salary you know wink wink
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:41.120]  that's how this works and so I'm already digressing let's talk to Brad in
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:47.840]  Michigan you're on the air Brad go ahead I like to talk to you I wish I had a
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:51.360]  little more time to talk because I'd like to mention something about the
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:55.160]  invasive species findings in Michigan I believe that's just setting the stage
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:59.080]  for eventually naming humans as an invasive species on this well no all
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:02.800]  the big environmentalists have said our animals our dogs our cats our horses
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:08.240]  our cows are all invasive species and they want them taxed and then banned I
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:14.200]  mean I mean people like oh well that'll never happen no they run things we
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:18.680]  never have socialist health care we never have big government we never have
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:22.760]  gun control we never have open borders five years ago sheriffs would say that
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:28.280]  the feds were giving illegals get out of jail free cards now it's admitted see I
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:33.280]  mean it's all happening sorry go ahead what I really like to talk about actually
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:37.480]  is what I called about it to talk about the awakening in general I feel that
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:42.280]  our greatest tool our greatest weapon against the globalists is to wake other
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:45.640]  people up and to make them realize because it's our numbers that will save
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:51.120]  us and I spend a lot of time trying to wake people up I've gone through a lot
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:55.080]  of frustration from it because I tend to sometimes get angry that people can't
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:16:01.400]  see what's right in front of them one of the problems with that is through that
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:06.120]  I've learned good tips on how to wake people up and I'd like to share some of
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:10.040]  them with your with your listeners the first thing I find is if I get people
[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:15.480]  talking about liberty as they define it and what's important to them their eyes
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:20.840]  seem to open very quickly and I can start to awaken them to the things that
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:25.760]  are important and defending our liberty and most importantly to remain calm I
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:29.640]  get I've days where I get fired up as fired up as you do and I know that that's
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:33.480]  the time I need to call somebody else that's already awake and talk to them
[02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:37.760]  because once I start getting fired up talking to somebody I can see them shut
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:41.760]  off they shut off instantly and one of the most important things is to follow
[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:46.040]  up because when people wake up they seem to go through these stages where first
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:49.120]  they get angry and they need somebody to talk to and I have to be there for them
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:52.480]  I have to listen to them and let them get that frustration out but the other
[02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:56.680]  thing is as I've seen repeatedly where somebody wakes up and then they get on
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:01.000]  the look as they get on that ledge and I have to talk them down because they
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:06.080]  see it as so hopeless to fight against these people and if you let people go
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:11.080]  past that point they shut off and never come back and it's really important for
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:13.920]  people to think about these things when they're trying to wake somebody up
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:21.760]  because if you really want to help you have to not scare people away I'm
[02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:28.920]  listening to you that's that's that's it I just I wish people would would really
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:33.800]  spend time talking and I would like you to spend some time talking to people
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:38.360]  about how it is a constructive way to well awaken people and usually their
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:46.080]  own their own knowledge it goes off on its own exactly let me let me say this
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:51.320]  to you I spend a lot of time trying to figure out how I can do a better job and
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:56.640]  I'm able to apply some of that but generally it's just a frontal assault
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:02.320]  trying to shock people who are in deep denial out of that and I've been
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:08.120]  extremely successful but I can hear that you have passion you have confidence
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:13.480]  and I also hear compassion in your voice when people try to wake folks up from
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:17.840]  I know this sounds cookie but did you know then that's a cue for them to laugh
[02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:25.800]  at you but when you approach it from a loving serious position you can really
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:29.080]  get through to a lot of people I can hear that in your voice and I think what
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:37.360]  you are doing personally I agree on a one-to-one basis it is better to have the
[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:43.440]  smooth approach via a medium like radio especially which is a very hot media it's
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:48.040]  it's it's I'm very effective at that never tried to do it on purpose but it's a
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:54.720]  hot medium TV not so much but it's still telegraphs but it's different strokes
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:59.520]  for different folks different ways of reaching out are going to affect
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:04.040]  different people different ways but I tend to agree with you that the old
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:08.160]  frontal assault is not the best way in person it's best to say hey you think
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:13.320]  everything's going well in the world do you think I mean do you like the things
[02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:15.400]  that are happening where you think things are going to be in the future and
[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:19.480]  most people instinctively go wow I don't think things are going to be too good
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:24.080]  in the future whereas in the 50s and 60s people did they were demanding
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:28.960]  something better because they'd always had seen things getting better now people
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:34.160]  are more I just want to keep what I've got because they instinctively know
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:39.440]  things are in deep trouble now you're also waking people up now in a time when
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:43.920]  it's easier to wake them up because other people and I'm sure you did as well
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:49.600]  hit the barbed wire a long time ago people used to be in such a trance that
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:54.520]  the two by four upside the head was the most effective I want to give you one
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:57.360]  more minute we come back to finish up we'll just continue with calls these
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:03.080]  are great calls today and I do have some reports we're gonna get to folks Iran and

[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:27.160]  the reason I'm so freaked out is that government is engaging in crimes at
[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:34.000]  every level and and not getting in trouble and there's so many crimes I
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:41.880]  can't even keep track of it what is going on that we don't know about who's
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:45.840]  watching the watchers I was just thinking about this during the break how
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:50.560]  government now admits that it's listening and watching and recording phone
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:59.120]  calls faxes emails without warrants and that's just the way it is every time
[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:04.080]  they do that it's a felony in England it's still illegal and the government has
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:09.920]  now come out and said doesn't matter we're recording everything and the BBC
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:14.400]  and London Telegraph they all report it like it's a good thing like by the way
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:28.680]  we listen and record everything we listen to and record everything everything
[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:36.040]  and I've gotten so conditioned I think I flashed that article on screen yesterday
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:39.520]  I didn't even talk about it in fact will you guys pull that back up for me the
[02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:43.640]  London Telegraph headline I think was something like government to record and
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:50.120]  everything and then it's got people saying this is unbelievable this is they
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:54.640]  had a government minister saying this is six million times worse than it is now
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:59.120]  that was one headline this surveillance six million times worse than it is now
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:06.480]  and then another headline was worse than 1984 and people are like well what do I
[02:26:06.480 --> 02:26:10.920]  have to hide let them listen they're gonna make stuff up folks they they want
[02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:14.560]  to be able to say they're listening to you and surveilling so they can just put
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:17.640]  whatever they want on your computer
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:23.760]  and again you think I like going up against these people you think it's
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:28.160]  fun I just it's got to be done that's one reason I realized I go into a rage
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:32.600]  all the time because instead of being afraid I get mad at them and I'm having
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:37.240]  to confront them I get so disgusted with the globalist and then the general
[02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:42.120]  public who's letting all this happen I really get mad at them because you know
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:45.760]  what we do have a great country this is a great country it's full of great
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:54.000]  people we have such prosperity and I see my future in my children's future and my
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.600]  wife's future going down a rat hole and it makes me mad every time I see good
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:05.320]  things it makes me mad you understand that every time I look at my daughters who
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:10.120]  are so innocent and pure and full of electricity and so innocent and I think
[02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:14.440]  about how bad this world is every time I look at my son who is so good and
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:18.520]  strong and smart and loving and I and I think about the stuff out there in the
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:23.320]  world it just makes me sick and I know parents know what I'm talking about it
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:30.680]  is and it is it is painful to my heart I feel it in my heart and I just wish
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:36.400]  people weren't so bad I wish people but you know I can deal with a robber or a
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:43.480]  kidnapper or a killer but who I can't deal with is big powerful mega
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:47.400]  corporations and governments who are above the law and that's the most
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:52.680]  dangerous thing in history governments kill more people than anything else in
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:57.080]  history unnatural cause and we're all in grave danger and if you don't know that
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:03.800]  you aren't paying attention and the danger is intensifying by the minute
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:16.160]  my gut is so on edge right now that it is torture I mean this morning I shot
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:19.640]  like two or three videos and I haven't had time to upload you know where I was
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:24.080]  just covering different topics I cannot and again I know I'm talking about my
[02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:27.200]  shelf here I know you're going through this as well so it's all I can do is
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:30.800]  talk about what I'm experiencing and hopefully it can give people a window
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:37.000]  into their own minds to really focus on these issues and think about where is
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:42.160]  this going what will we put up with because if stuff is this bad today what
[02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:48.360]  is it going to be a month from now a year from now 10 years from now think of
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:53.560]  think of 20 years ago would you have ever imagined all of this that's
[02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:57.240]  currently admitted would be going on no you would think that was the wildest
[02:28:57.240 --> 02:29:03.680]  science fiction book ever and now it's just there and there's this sense of oh
[02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:08.000]  well that's just the way it is well the people running things aren't just going
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:13.000]  to stop at some certain point because if they do there's more evil people that
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:16.280]  will replace them and go even further and then those that are even more evil
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:22.600]  that'll go further it's a progression it's it's an absolute race to the bottom
[02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:26.920]  just like NAFTA and GATT or a race to the bottom economically Ross Perot is
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:33.160]  right evil tyranny is a race to the bottom all right I'm gonna come back

[02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:07.380]  research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still
[02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:11.920]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:14.800]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[02:32:14.800 --> 02:32:19.120]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[02:32:19.120 --> 02:32:24.240]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight
[02:32:24.240 --> 02:32:28.680]  off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and

[02:33:02.960 --> 02:33:22.640]  lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:47.120]  alright Brad in Michigan you were making some points earlier and I skipped a
[02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:52.200]  segment before going back to you thanks for holding finish up your point just
[02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:56.280]  one last thing is that the biggest thing that I always try to remember and I
[02:33:56.280 --> 02:34:01.520]  think this is the major distinction between our movement and the globalist
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:07.040]  luciferians that would have their way is that they believe that 90% of life is
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:11.720]  worthless and needs to be eliminated and we believe that all human life is
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:16.760]  precious and is worth saving well more than that that 90% thing is just what
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:21.920]  they teach their minions look oh we're only going to kill 80 to 90% but if you
[02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:27.880]  get into the more internal documents they talk about how the last globalist
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:32.160]  will fight the you know the the other globalist for the power and they're
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:36.280]  going to merge with machines and become gods it's just total power trips and
[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:40.680]  we're like well that sounds crazy because a normal person is just happy to
[02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:45.120]  be healthy and to have healthy children and is happy to be outside on a pretty
[02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:49.720]  day these guys like to tie women up in dungeons and torture them and you're
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:54.040]  like but that doesn't make sense because you're not screwed up like they are and
[02:34:54.040 --> 02:35:01.880]  so good people are always blind to that type of evil that's the problem is that
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:07.000]  good people just can't get their minds around just how wicked the wicked are
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:12.320]  but I mean they want to get rid of almost everybody and they're delusional
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:18.280]  again why would their lowest level minion the TSA creature why would they
[02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:22.640]  routinely go crazy and start announcing their god or ask women out for dates so
[02:35:22.640 --> 02:35:28.640]  they're going to plant drugs on them or grope women or pull their shirt off in
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:34.560]  what was an Amarillo and tell the woman she had beautiful you know body parts
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:39.560]  and then they had to settle because it was on video that they're crazy they're
[02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:44.160]  crazy it's not that they're even that smart at many levels it's that they are
[02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:48.760]  they're willing to do the work to figure out how to take over because you don't
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:53.520]  have to then have beautiful art or have an incredible voice or be a great
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:36:04.960]  musician or be a scientist or be a you know artisan or someone who has a skill
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:09.720]  you don't have to do that if your skill is getting in charge and so you've got
[02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:14.560]  this giant system of scum competing with each other to get into the positions
[02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:19.280]  of power and so of course you've always got people on the bottom the cops that
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:22.880]  don't want to be evil and don't want power who actually got into help people
[02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:27.520]  they're never going to go up to the top because only the most oily manipulative
[02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:30.800]  people on average are gonna go to the top sometimes good people for whatever
[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:35.400]  reasons get to the top and then the system comes after them that's why more
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:42.800]  and more and I appreciate your call as the system gets discredited more and
[02:36:42.800 --> 02:36:47.560]  more you are going to see people standing up and saying no because as that
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:52.800]  illusion drops as that lie that the system's all knowing all good and
[02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:57.600]  everybody else is bad as that hoax implodes they're gonna think it's business
[02:36:57.600 --> 02:37:01.240]  as usual and get even more arrogant which is now happening and that's only
[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:05.200]  gonna serve to wake people up even faster let's talk to Kevin in the
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:13.680]  California Kevin welcome hi Alex hey buddy my name's Kevin rest off are you
[02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:18.920]  SK a U. F. F. let me just stop you that's fine and I'm and you sound like a
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:23.800]  real person in the past people will call up with a name or number to harass
[02:37:23.800 --> 02:37:27.280]  somebody who they aren't and for liability reasons we really don't like
[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:31.320]  to give people's full name but there you've given it on air go ahead okay
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:36.920]  yeah you can see how I've suffered if you go to my YouTube I got shot four
[02:37:36.920 --> 02:37:42.800]  times with the 38 the guy that shot me said he never saw me with the weapon
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:51.520]  he said I was only 10 to 12 feet away from him when he shot me he told the
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:38:01.240]  guy that he said that the guy that told him to shoot me had the guy that
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:05.120]  told him to shoot me had blood on his hand and and the weapon that they said
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:14.320]  that I used had blood on it and I wasn't no I was only bleeding from my chest
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:20.040]  anyway so you've been wronged and you're basically trying to call in to get
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:23.520]  attention to your case so people can find out exactly what happened to you
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:30.400]  yeah I got wrong because I have a the Templar Handbook and the I have it in
[02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:34.920]  my possession it's called Tactics and Marner for Knights of the Order of the
[02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:44.120]  Temple and in it it says on page 315 paragraph 779
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:49.600]  Constitution of the Grand Encampment of the Knights Templar of the United States
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:55.160]  of America in order in order to secure a greater unity better government and to
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:59.800]  increase the prosperity and influence of the orders of Christian Masonic
[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:04.600]  knighthood in the United States this Constitution is ordained and established
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:10.120]  article 1 the Grand Encampment of whom composed section 1 the Supreme
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:15.520]  Legislative Judicial and Executive Executive power of the orders of the
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:21.000]  Red Cross Knights Templar and Knights of Malta shall be vested in the Grand
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:25.080]  Encampment of Knights Templar of the United States of California which shall
[02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:30.360]  consist of the following members the Grand Master, the Deputy Grand Master, the
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:36.160]  Grand General, the Grand Captain General, Warden, Junior Warden,
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:41.960]  Treasurer, Recorder, Pralate, so on so forth then back here it says honors paid
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:48.400]  by Templars the order of the temple is on page 553 the order of the temple is
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:52.560]  powerful in members wealth and position and honors paid to its officers and
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:56.280]  representatives should therefore be in keeping with the dignity of the order
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:40:01.240]  the following named officer will be received with standards group drooping
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:05.680]  all officers okay well that sounds like some kind of Masonic gobbledygook to
[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:09.920]  me you think somebody would shoot you for this I mean I can go buy supposed
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:13.040]  Knights Templar handbooks on the internet I just searched it right now I can buy
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:17.600]  buy the rings everything else why would why would people shoot you over this
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:20.900]  well because it says down here the president of the United States is
[02:40:20.900 --> 02:40:26.320]  looted as paragraph 1284 and sir I understand you're reading out of the
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:29.720]  something you think the Knights Templars handbook tell us how you came upon it
[02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:35.760]  and why you're saying someone shots you well I came up I came across the book
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:42.560]  I met the great grandson of the guy who owned this book the book was locked in a
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:47.680]  gentleman who came Freemason pharmacist who came over from New York to San
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:53.320]  Francisco during the gold rush the book was locked in his safe and inherited by
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:58.240]  his great-grandson locked the great-grandson drilled open the book
[02:40:58.240 --> 02:41:04.760]  drilled open the safe and inside the safe was the TV show why don't you shoot
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:08.060]  video of it and put it on the web because you know that there'd be no reason to
[02:41:08.060 --> 02:41:15.760]  kill you if this is some really super secret book I once you expose it it got
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:20.680]  a shield and inside the shield of the school and crossbones yeah that's a great
[02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:28.920]  shield state of California two people on a horse and the iron cross and on page
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:36.280]  415 the iron cross is the temper cross yes it is and the temper cross is also
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:41.800]  under the name of the iron cross the cross of Prussia the the war across the
[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:45.840]  France they're all the same no it's a bunch of symbols but I mean I'm just
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:49.880]  asking you that's interesting so what is the point of the call you started out
[02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:53.400]  by saying you were shot and now you've got this book I mean why were they
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:42:01.720]  shooting you well I had gotten into the altercation with a couple people and the
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:06.400]  dude went to his gun to his truck well listen listen why don't you why don't
[02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:09.960]  you shoot some video of this and put it on YouTube I really appreciate your call
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:13.480]  and we always get some interesting calls like that which you can't confirm one
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:22.160]  way or the other just expose it scan it put it on the internet I don't know how
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:26.200]  you know that they came to shoot you and you think it's because of this but you
[02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:32.280]  got an altercation with somebody pretty wild story Paul in Texas Paul you're on
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:38.200]  the air go ahead good afternoon Alex I thank you for the beautiful segue you
[02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:43.640]  gave me earlier okay so what I understand the plan here is to use all
[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:50.560]  legal nonviolent means to restore our Republic correct yes to get our basic
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:57.160]  liberties recognized and to kick the criminal cabal out of DC okay well then
[02:42:57.160 --> 02:43:05.120]  enough talk let's do it I propose an emergency legal fund money bomb that you
[02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:12.880]  can set up I will give you today $1,000 to set this off because right now there
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:18.680]  are so many freedom loving lawyers and investigators who would dearly like to
[02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:23.400]  join this course but they may they may be in a position where they need to get
[02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:29.680]  funded now you reach millions of people Alex for a measly thousand dollars if we
[02:43:29.680 --> 02:43:35.720]  can get one million people to donate a thousand dollars like I'll do now that'll
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:41.720]  give you a billion dollar war chest now people like to be on the side of the
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:46.560]  winning team the reason why I don't think you're finding a lot of people in
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:50.560]  government standing up and choosing the right side it's because they don't
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:54.360]  believe the right side's going to be the winning team at least that's why you
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:58.160]  morally have to decide to do the right thing even if the odds are against you
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:03.800]  that that's the whole point of it yeah I understand that but you know people are
[02:44:03.800 --> 02:44:09.200]  human I think if we show them that we are the winning team you're gonna find a
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:13.000]  lot of rats jump in the ship well that's already started let me listen I
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:18.640]  agree with what you're saying but I am not the best manager I mean I'm decent
[02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:23.080]  and we got a lot of stuff going on here and I can barely you know keep 37 people
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:26.640]  going the right direction they're great folks but that's a full-time job I
[02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:34.760]  wouldn't know how to collect that much money I wouldn't know how to deploy it
[02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:40.480]  I mean what legal funds I mean so we get some good court rulings sometimes you do
[02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:44.880]  get the courts do the right thing but that takes years to battle out and on
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:49.520]  top of it we have this big corrupt tyrannical military industrial complex
[02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:53.400]  run by foreign banks to enforce it and they're telling Congress we're gonna
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:56.880]  launch wars yeah without your approval so they're already doing a bunch of
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:45:02.200]  illegal stuff and ignoring court rulings Obama came out today Paul watching
[02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:08.000]  an article and basically implied they may just ignore the Supreme Court I guess
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.240]  they've gotten the word that they overturned it it's not gonna come out
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:14.160]  until June but the fact that he's starting to talk about maybe ignoring the
[02:45:14.160 --> 02:45:18.800]  Supreme Court that's in my stack of news it's at info wars calm really shows I
[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:24.600]  think the Supreme Court may have done the right thing so again we are the
[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:30.760]  biggest anti-neural order operation out there that said we're rag tag we only
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:36.520]  reach 15 million people a week most of those are sporadic I do a money bomb to
[02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:42.160]  hire some reporters to get the equipment we need and I raised $400,000 I mean sir
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:48.840]  we use the about the lowest-grade switchers we can and we're trying to
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:55.000]  upgrade them right now and they cost like $35,000 we use I mean I just don't
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:46:00.040]  have the money and and people I don't think a million people would give me a
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:04.000]  thousand dollars if a million people would give me a thousand dollars I would
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:08.640]  put it in a tax-free foundation publicly with public books and I could
[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:13.520]  guarantee that 95% of that much money would actually be spent on legal
[02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:18.360]  defenses and things but then we wouldn't pick every perfect legal thing and
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:24.160]  people say oh look this this lawyer they pick was bad or this was so see that's
[02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:28.640]  how they get the the the public's been trained to not get involved themselves
[02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:34.280]  and then nitpick anybody that is involved so but I mean that is a great
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:40.960]  plan but I estimate if we formulated a plan created something like that because
[02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:47.440]  I've thought of similar things a little bit of this is cowardice I say I'm not a
[02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:54.120]  coward but at a subconscious level I tend to hold myself back sometimes not
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:59.560]  even a fear of death mainly laziness because then I would try to do it all
[02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:02.840]  just right and it's like I don't want to take that on do you see what I'm saying
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:07.760]  it's like I've already taken on so much that I do too much so when I'm on air
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:12.080]  it's not as effective if I did take off more time or didn't do the nightly news
[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:18.200]  you know but then I am overall again I won't talk about myself all day but then
[02:47:18.200 --> 02:47:21.560]  we start becoming the focus of the debate it's like trying to tell Ron Paul
[02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:25.400]  what he should do well I mean sure he makes mistakes but he's the one in the
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:29.160]  arena doing a great job of the 30-year track record I told folks they were
[02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:32.560]  gonna steal the election from him but I said still supporting to inject real
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:38.560]  ideas now people see that he really did win Iowa he won main they stole it
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:44.080]  after that he really started losing because now folks thought well he can't
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:50.560]  win I'll just go with somebody else so now he's fading off but staying in to
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:48:00.200]  inject real issues so this is a process my main mission I mean look we get more
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:06.200]  traffic than MSNBC.com and CNBC.com combined go look it up compared to the
[02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:10.000]  Lexa or wherever you wish we get more traffic than Limbaugh and Glenn Beck
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:14.680]  sites to put together but but all those guys make I don't know Limbaugh probably
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:20.240]  20 times the money I make are more Glenn Beck 10 times maybe 20 and I think you
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:27.320]  make I mean it's it so again again we don't have the big money support we do
[02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:32.840]  just have the people out there we are in the true grassroots since as big as a
[02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:39.080]  Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh that globally much bigger but we can barely you
[02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:45.880]  know have a secure place for me to live and pay the crew halfway decent and and
[02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:50.160]  you know do everything else so again it becomes a whole discussion I agree we
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:54.320]  should probably do more I just can't do it when I get off the air here I am
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:49:00.720]  gonna be exhausted for about 30 minutes and so I mean I just don't think at the
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:05.440]  end of the day I have to do everything plus I don't think we could raise a
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:10.040]  billion dollars sir delegate I mean if you don't have the time because you're
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:14.160]  busy I understand that we all have you know X number of things we need to do
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:18.720]  and there's only 24 hours in the day but if we're going to do this legally we
[02:49:18.720 --> 02:49:24.040]  have to do this I mean you can't expect any corrupt organizational group to
[02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:28.240]  investigate themselves I mean it's pointless well in 60 seconds give me a
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:35.520]  snapshot of your strategy well I think first of all we should I don't know any
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:40.120]  other choice but to use you as the hub of this because you're already in the
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:44.880]  front line here but we need to find out how many people are willing to
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:49.880]  participate in this who are the legal people there's a police officer who's
[02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:54.520]  investigating Obama's birth certificate doing a fantastic job but why has he
[02:49:54.520 --> 02:49:58.920]  got to just work completely on his own in the vacuum how many other people like
[02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:05.560]  that are willing and able to assist in this program but they don't know where
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:10.480]  to start because there's no way we can group you know the the enemy here is
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:15.200]  already well organized well funded and well grouped this is a very difficult
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:21.040]  job to do but the job still nevertheless has to be done not only do we have the
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:26.800]  the right to do it we have the obligation to do it and we've got it in
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:32.040]  writing we have the American Constitution that demands we do this we've

[02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:10.280]  this is some heavy knowledge that I'm gonna dish out and lay on your right
[02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:19.360]  now one reason that I've never grown this operation really big when I could
[02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:25.800]  have and launch a lot of business systems to fund it is I've always
[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:31.880]  instinctively known that if I get too big I can't stop infiltration and take
[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:42.920]  Tommy Chong Tommy Chong selling marijuana pipes all over the country
[02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:46.800]  making tens of millions of dollars of Cheech and Chong fame his son running it
[02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:54.640]  in a whole nother state from him totally legal but a few counties where it's
[02:54:54.640 --> 02:55:03.360]  illegal the feds tried for not one not to not three but four years to order and
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:08.000]  have it shipped to that county because then they could claim it was some
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.880]  interstate commerce thing that it was going across state lines to commit a
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:17.360]  crime in another state begging at federal they they never did it so the feds got
[02:55:17.360 --> 02:55:25.400]  one of their operatives employed at their facility to mail the bong the weed
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:36.760]  headpipe to that state and city and they had a kept jury put him in jail for it
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:41.080]  now regardless what you think of marijuana the point is that's really
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:49.640]  illegal it's a setup and I could go on for hours with confirmed cases of where
[02:55:49.640 --> 02:55:54.240]  this is done this is standard operating procedure now obviously if I'm trying to
[02:55:54.240 --> 02:55:57.520]  stay out of trouble with these people I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing so it's
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:01.240]  a balance and I just go with my gut go with my discernment you know I say the
[02:56:01.240 --> 02:56:05.400]  hardcore things that have to be said and leave it up to God but I trust in God
[02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:11.080]  but tie up my camel is the old better one saying says another writer more
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:17.600]  recent times said pray to God but roll away from the rocks was that Hunter S
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:27.960]  Thompson okay so I just I can't manage anymore people are always telling me what
[02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:34.160]  I need to do and all this a lot of it's good ideas it's just that at a certain
[02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:41.040]  point folks it's up to you and it was Hunter S Thompson said that but but let
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:44.920]  me lay the heavy knowledge on you here's the definition of strategy we'll put it
[02:56:44.920 --> 02:56:52.000]  on screen just scroll down for me so I can read the definition thank you the
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:56.840]  science at art of employing political economic psychological military forces
[02:56:56.840 --> 02:57:02.760]  of a nation or group of nations to afford the maximum support to adopted
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:10.080]  policies in peace or war a variety of or the instance of use of strategy a
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:15.160]  careful planner method now I use strategy doesn't mean my strategy is the
[02:57:15.160 --> 02:57:22.240]  best the enemy uses stratagem put stratagem on screen please an
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:27.320]  artifice or trick in war deceiving and outwitting the enemy a cleverly contrived
[02:57:27.320 --> 02:57:33.880]  trick or scheme for gaining an end skill and ruse or trickery now here's the
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:39.800]  here's the data I'm about to give you right now how you become corrupt as a
[02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:43.360]  nation is to begin to use stratagem against another enemy that's using
[02:57:43.360 --> 02:57:47.480]  stratagem it's like using the ring of Mordor you always end up using it
[02:57:47.480 --> 02:57:52.200]  against your own people you use lies deception evil you argue will camouflage
[02:57:52.200 --> 02:57:59.280]  as a lie you see and then it and then it expands on from there and in that
[02:57:59.280 --> 02:58:03.720]  discussion is how do you be fight evil without becoming evil because obviously
[02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:08.320]  you got to use some deception like camouflage that is a deception that
[02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:12.800]  one was first employed in World War one folks thought it was really immoral
[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:17.880]  because they said it would lead to what we have now becoming evil guarding the
[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:22.960]  truth with a bodyguard of lies it never works and if you look at our government
[02:58:22.960 --> 02:58:29.600]  everything it does is a stratagem and the training is to fight an enemy so we
[02:58:29.600 --> 02:58:32.280]  are the enemy the government has made us the enemy because the government's
[02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:35.680]  run by foreign banks it's not our government you understand this is not
[02:58:35.680 --> 02:58:51.920]  our government and it treats us like the enemy because it's the enemy
