[00:00.000 --> 00:12.280]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:12.280 --> 00:17.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:17.160 --> 00:23.280]  It is Monday already, the seventh day of September 2015.
[00:23.280 --> 00:25.560]  We have a big retransmission lined up.
[00:25.560 --> 00:28.000]  Ron Paul was on with us a few weeks ago.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.600]  One of the most powerful interviews, probably the most powerful we've ever done.
[00:31.600 --> 00:36.920]  Alveda King on the abortion situation, Representative Matt Shea being attacked by the Southern
[00:36.920 --> 00:41.080]  Property Law Center and others and of course Jim Mars in studio.
[00:41.080 --> 00:42.800]  That is all coming up.
[00:42.800 --> 00:48.560]  I will be filing special reports during this Monday live broadcast at infowars.com and
[00:48.560 --> 00:49.560]  prisonplotted.com.
[00:49.560 --> 00:53.160]  But I'm giving the crew off the day to spend time with their families.
[00:53.160 --> 00:58.680]  All work and no play makes a jack a super dumb down boy.
[00:58.680 --> 01:03.880]  But in the final equation, we have a scientific elite that has bad will towards humanity.
[01:03.880 --> 01:05.160]  They want to keep people in the dark.
[01:05.160 --> 01:09.160]  They want to keep us unmotivated and dumbed down and obsessed over simulated warfare and
[01:09.160 --> 01:13.520]  combat like the NFL and NHL and NBA and all the rest of it.
[01:13.520 --> 01:16.600]  And I'm simply here to just say, look, this is what's going on.
[01:16.600 --> 01:17.600]  Here's their own statements.
[01:17.600 --> 01:18.600]  Here's their own admissions.
[01:18.600 --> 01:21.720]  What are you going to do about it?
[01:21.720 --> 01:26.080]  I mean, we've got the Pope and world government running around saying the West has to accept
[01:26.080 --> 01:31.000]  all these illegals that are refugees caused by turning loose radical Islamists.
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.200]  I mean, that's a report Kit Daniels has got coming up in about 15 seconds.
[01:35.200 --> 01:39.320]  But the biggest thing we can all do is just decide we're not submitting and spread the
[01:39.320 --> 01:44.600]  word and say no to globalist and vote with our dollars before the casual society comes
[01:44.600 --> 01:45.600]  fully into place.
[01:45.600 --> 01:47.920]  And what really matters is getting our souls in line.
[01:47.920 --> 01:55.000]  Here's this Kit Daniels report straight ahead in the full broadcast.
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.680]  Obama's Justice Department accused a Nebraska meatpacking plant of racism because the company
[01:59.680 --> 02:03.400]  dared to ask its employees for their legal status.
[02:03.400 --> 02:08.600]  Despite the fact that feds have raided similar plants in the past for hiring illegal aliens,
[02:08.600 --> 02:14.960]  the DOJ claimed that Nebraska beef LTD required non-U.S. citizens but not their similarly
[02:14.960 --> 02:20.480]  situated U.S. citizens to present specific documentary proof of their immigration status
[02:20.480 --> 02:23.360]  to verify their employment eligibility.
[02:23.360 --> 02:28.320]  With the feds breathing down its neck, the business Nebraska beef LTD agreed to pay
[02:28.320 --> 02:34.720]  Uncle Sam a $200,000 civil penalty and establish an uncapped back pay fund to calm say individuals
[02:34.720 --> 02:38.560]  who lost wages because they couldn't prove they were in the country legally.
[02:38.560 --> 02:40.160]  The JIS will watch reported.
[02:40.160 --> 02:44.520]  Additionally, the business will undergo compliance monitoring, which means big brother will be
[02:44.520 --> 02:46.440]  watching very closely.
[02:46.440 --> 02:49.840]  The head of the DOJ civil rights division explains that the agency is on a mission
[02:49.840 --> 02:54.960]  to eliminate unnecessary discriminatory barriers to employment so workers can support their
[02:54.960 --> 02:57.400]  family and contribute to U.S. economy.
[02:57.400 --> 02:58.400]  You heard that right.
[02:58.400 --> 03:04.020]  The Justice Department is actually preventing companies to fire employees because they're
[03:04.020 --> 03:06.800]  legal aliens.
[03:06.800 --> 03:08.080]  This is completely ridiculous.
[03:08.080 --> 03:14.520]  I mean, back in 2006, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement rated several packing
[03:14.520 --> 03:19.320]  plants across six states and arrested 1,300 legal aliens.
[03:19.320 --> 03:23.400]  But what we see now is complete contrast where we got the Justice Department creating this
[03:23.400 --> 03:27.000]  chilling effect to prevent companies from even questioning whether their employees are
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.600]  legal or not.
[03:28.600 --> 03:32.840]  This is what I would call phase two Obama's Amnesty program.
[03:32.840 --> 03:38.200]  Phase one, which has started around 2013, was where we saw Obama tell the Border Patrol
[03:38.200 --> 03:44.000]  that they needed the back off of enforcing immigration laws, which basically opened the
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.320]  border for illegal aliens and human traffickers and what have you.
[03:48.320 --> 03:53.080]  And when a lot of these illegal aliens crossed the border, they got detained by Border Patrol.
[03:53.080 --> 03:57.160]  And after several weeks, Border Patrol actually bought them bus tickets to ship them wherever
[03:57.160 --> 03:58.800]  they wanted to go in the country.
[03:58.800 --> 04:03.160]  So let's say you had a legal alien that got to McAllen, got detained in McAllen for like
[04:03.160 --> 04:04.160]  three weeks.
[04:04.160 --> 04:11.080]  The Border Patrol actually took them to the bus station, bought them tickets, to say San
[04:11.080 --> 04:16.400]  Antonio, Austin, Dallas, Denver, Wisconsin, wherever they wanted to go.
[04:16.400 --> 04:20.440]  And in exchange for the bus tickets, the legal aliens were given these immigration court dates
[04:20.440 --> 04:22.360]  that they promised to appear to.
[04:22.360 --> 04:26.040]  But a lot of these court dates were like three, four years in advance, and 90% of the legal
[04:26.040 --> 04:28.160]  aliens are not going to show up anyway.
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.640]  So now what we have is phase two, where the Obama administration is scaring companies
[04:32.640 --> 04:36.960]  away from even questioning the legal status of their employees.
[04:36.960 --> 04:41.120]  So once the illegal aliens get in the country and get settled in, get jobs, get families,
[04:41.120 --> 04:44.520]  what have you, then they don't even have to worry about ever getting deported because
[04:44.520 --> 04:46.920]  they're never going to risk losing their job.
[04:46.920 --> 05:00.120]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with infowars.com.
[05:00.120 --> 05:06.080]  A humanitarian crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Second World War is happening right
[05:06.080 --> 05:07.760]  now across the globe.
[05:07.760 --> 05:12.680]  Syrian refugees streaming into Europe refuse to be put into camps and are boarding trains
[05:12.680 --> 05:17.320]  for Germany, where the government has pledged billions of dollars in euros to support them,
[05:17.320 --> 05:22.680]  to cover the cost of social benefits, language courses, and refugee integration into the
[05:22.680 --> 05:23.960]  labor market.
[05:23.960 --> 05:28.840]  Germany expects 800,000 refugees this year, up from 200,000 last year.
[05:28.840 --> 05:34.240]  More than 4 million more wait to enter Europe from camps in Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon.
[05:34.240 --> 05:38.400]  Most of the refugees are Sunni Muslims, but yet these wealthy Sunni Muslim countries like
[05:38.400 --> 05:43.800]  Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Bahrain have refused to take in
[05:43.800 --> 05:44.800]  refugees.
[05:44.800 --> 05:50.240]  The unfolding humanitarian crisis in Europe, the largest since the Second World War, is
[05:50.240 --> 05:55.080]  a direct result of the effort by the United States and the Gulf Emirates to overthrow
[05:55.080 --> 05:56.400]  the Syrian government.
[05:56.400 --> 06:22.400]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo reporting for infowars.com.

[07:53.040 --> 08:22.320]  I'm Alex Jones for Supermail Vitality and InfowarsLife.com, and I salute you, our supporters.
[08:23.160 --> 08:28.600]  Ron Paul joins us for the next 20 minutes or so.
[08:28.600 --> 08:33.240]  Institute for Peace and Prosperity.org is his powerful think tank website.
[08:33.240 --> 08:38.760]  He, of course, does his daily TV and radio show, Vignettes, and he's got a new book coming
[08:38.760 --> 08:39.760]  out.
[08:39.760 --> 08:44.600]  Swords into plowshears will obviously have him on as soon as that comes out, but more
[08:44.600 --> 08:52.000]  active, probably more effective now than anybody else in the world fighting collectivism.
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.520]  He'll go down in history, undoubtedly, as greater in the fight for liberty than even
[08:55.520 --> 09:00.920]  in Alexander Schultz and Eason, a modern Thomas Jefferson, and he's a humble man and he won't
[09:00.920 --> 09:06.640]  say those things about himself and even the movement won't say those things because libertarians
[09:06.640 --> 09:12.640]  are humble, conservatives are humble, patriots are humble, but we have to celebrate our leaders
[09:12.640 --> 09:18.840]  and celebrate that he was Dr. No 20-something years ago, never won anything, never got cosponsors,
[09:18.840 --> 09:23.000]  and then by the time he left Congress, much of the Tea Party movement had adopted his
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.720]  Americana ideas.
[09:24.720 --> 09:27.040]  That said, former Congressman Ron Paul joins us.
[09:27.040 --> 09:30.480]  I want to cover the waterfront with him.
[09:30.480 --> 09:37.240]  First off, a few weeks ago, you put out an alert saying that get ready for serious crises
[09:37.240 --> 09:39.760]  in the stock market.
[09:39.760 --> 09:42.760]  You talked about problems in the bond market.
[09:42.760 --> 09:44.880]  You said a day of reckoning was coming.
[09:44.880 --> 09:46.680]  We're getting closer to the big event.
[09:46.680 --> 09:52.680]  In your own words, being a Von Mies Institute fellow, being on the banking committee, understanding
[09:52.680 --> 09:56.840]  the inside baseball, is the day of judgment for the Federal Reserve and other private
[09:56.840 --> 09:58.840]  central banks coming?
[09:58.840 --> 10:06.040]  Yeah, I think for not to come would be a surprise to me.
[10:06.040 --> 10:07.640]  You've been involved in this a long time.
[10:07.640 --> 10:11.280]  I mean, it wasn't like you didn't know what was happening with the housing bubble.
[10:11.280 --> 10:15.600]  We had the Nasdaq bubble, and now we have other bubbles.
[10:15.600 --> 10:18.760]  We still have another stock market bubble, and there's another housing bubble going
[10:18.760 --> 10:19.760]  on.
[10:19.760 --> 10:21.320]  But the big bubble, I think, is in the bond bubble.
[10:21.320 --> 10:28.120]  It's been going on for 35 years, taking interest rates from 21% down to actually negative.
[10:28.120 --> 10:30.240]  They've been getting away with it.
[10:30.240 --> 10:31.240]  This means distortion.
[10:31.240 --> 10:36.240]  Not only is there money involved, but it distorted all the investment over these periods of time
[10:36.240 --> 10:39.640]  in the biggest distortion that it encourages debt.
[10:39.640 --> 10:43.480]  Encourages debt for a lot of people, but in particular government.
[10:43.480 --> 10:49.720]  As long as our government is able to print the reserve currency, it's going to limp
[10:49.720 --> 10:51.800]  along even though our economy is limping along.
[10:51.800 --> 10:57.000]  But that will come to an end, and right now we're starting to see the whole thing coming
[10:57.000 --> 10:58.000]  apart.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.720]  I mean, we look at Detroit as an example.
[11:00.720 --> 11:02.480]  We see what's happening in Greece.
[11:02.480 --> 11:08.440]  They're worrying about what's going to happen after Greece is recognized as actually totally
[11:08.440 --> 11:09.440]  bankrupt.
[11:09.440 --> 11:11.000]  There'll be other countries.
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.120]  This distortion has been going on for so long.
[11:13.120 --> 11:17.880]  Most people think that when governments print money, that the only thing that happens is
[11:17.880 --> 11:22.560]  that prices go up as a consequence of inflation, and a lot of that is true, and it's a serious
[11:22.560 --> 11:25.880]  problem and destroys the middle class and the poor.
[11:25.880 --> 11:32.240]  But to me, the bigger distortion is the lack of pricing for money and causing people to
[11:32.240 --> 11:38.120]  do dumb things, and that's why they overbuild and overinvest in governments, overspend.
[11:38.120 --> 11:43.720]  And then you have the Keynesians still in charge that says the solution for this is
[11:43.720 --> 11:48.240]  just to spend more money and print more money, and that's coming to an end.
[11:48.240 --> 11:52.120]  The day of reckoning is at hand.
[11:52.120 --> 11:57.200]  Undoubtedly, the day of reckoning came a long time ago for Greece in areas of Africa and
[11:57.200 --> 11:58.200]  Latin America.
[11:58.200 --> 12:02.200]  There seems to be this arrogant idea that it can't ever happen here, but if you look
[12:02.200 --> 12:08.840]  at the real numbers, 0.2 growth, that's what the Cook numbers, for most Americans, we've
[12:08.840 --> 12:11.280]  been in a very long recession.
[12:11.280 --> 12:22.720]  Yes, and even the figures that came out today on the unemployment, down to 5.3%, not recognizing
[12:22.720 --> 12:30.000]  or admitting that 646,000 dropped out of the workforce, and we have more people, 93
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.240]  million people unemployed and out of the workforce, and that if you look at full-time jobs, this
[12:36.240 --> 12:40.480]  is a disaster, even though they claim there were a lot of new jobs, but they were part-time
[12:40.480 --> 12:45.040]  jobs, so there's a few new jobs, and then they fudged the unemployment figures, but
[12:45.040 --> 12:50.240]  it's all in the system, and even the people who know these are fudged figures still play
[12:50.240 --> 12:54.400]  along because they know that the majority will play along, and they think there's another
[12:54.400 --> 12:57.160]  buck to be made in trading.
[12:57.160 --> 13:02.600]  But the markets are more powerful than the Fed, and in governments, and markets will
[13:02.600 --> 13:03.600]  rule.
[13:03.600 --> 13:08.760]  A lot of people would always say, you know, keep an eye on the Fed on what they're doing,
[13:08.760 --> 13:13.920]  but the Fed needs to keep an eye on the market because the market eventually will take over,
[13:13.920 --> 13:20.000]  just like the market finally took over when they claimed that the dollar was worth $35
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  an ounce, and that was not true.
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.280]  So the governments will lie to us, they'll get away with it for a long time, there will
[13:27.280 --> 13:32.280]  be an illusion and a false trust, and we will benefit tremendously because we have a military
[13:32.280 --> 13:37.120]  might and because we have this privilege of issuing a reserve currency of the world.
[13:37.120 --> 13:43.640]  But you know, the obligations that we have, the unfunded obligation over $2 trillion,
[13:43.640 --> 13:48.440]  you know, $200 trillion, that is not going to be paid, and the only argument that goes
[13:48.440 --> 13:53.040]  on with these countries like in Greece and other, is who's going to get stuck, and the
[13:53.040 --> 13:57.240]  bankers are worried they're going to get stuck, and that's what they argue about.
[13:57.240 --> 14:03.120]  But the debt will not be paid, and we cannot pay our debt, it's just a matter of time,
[14:03.120 --> 14:05.640]  but people say, well, tell me when, tell me when.
[14:05.640 --> 14:10.960]  Well, nobody knows the exact moment or the exact event, but you can tell when the foundation
[14:10.960 --> 14:16.120]  has eroded, and the foundation, not only of our economic system, but the world financial
[14:16.120 --> 14:22.000]  system like no other time in history has been eroded, and there's going to be serious problems
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.600]  because there will have to be a correction of this, and you can't correct it with more
[14:26.600 --> 14:30.680]  spending and more debt, which is what they're trying to do.
[14:30.680 --> 14:35.360]  And then we add the Puerto Rico situation, and then we've got thousands of counties
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.840]  that are on the edge or already bankrupt, we've got multiple states that fiscally are
[14:39.840 --> 14:46.440]  worse off than Greece, I mean the US really is on the same debt path as Greece, and my
[14:46.440 --> 14:51.240]  concern is the bigger they are, the harder they fall, it seems like this bubble is so
[14:51.240 --> 14:57.320]  mega massive that when it does implode, and we're so non-self-sufficient, back when your
[14:57.320 --> 15:01.480]  parents, and I guess you as a young man went through the Great Depression, people were
[15:01.480 --> 15:03.560]  much more resilient.
[15:03.560 --> 15:12.920]  Now people are not agrarian, we were 90% rural, 10% urban, now we're 90% urban, 10% rural.
[15:12.920 --> 15:20.640]  If we have a real depression in this country, I just absolutely fear for my children.
[15:20.640 --> 15:26.400]  There's reason to be fearful because the work ethic is not with us at all.
[15:26.400 --> 15:28.880]  People believe that they are owed a living.
[15:28.880 --> 15:33.320]  People in Greece, you sympathize with them to a degree because the banks have ripped
[15:33.320 --> 15:39.200]  off the system for so long, but that doesn't eliminate the responsibility of the individuals
[15:39.200 --> 15:43.720]  who have benefited from this, free money, whether it's student aid or houses and these
[15:43.720 --> 15:49.680]  sort of things, it's been there for a long time, and right now there's many people in
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.120]  Greece who are really determined, they hate this austerity thing, of course I can't see
[15:54.120 --> 15:59.280]  in the idea that the IMF is running the show, or the European Union is running the show,
[15:59.280 --> 16:01.640]  it should be liquidated.
[16:01.640 --> 16:07.240]  But they're retiring at the age of 56 at full benefits, and we have that same problem
[16:07.240 --> 16:08.240]  here.
[16:08.240 --> 16:14.640]  That's what brought Detroit down, and I imagine every state has a problem, but the unemployment
[16:14.640 --> 16:20.000]  is a big problem, but it's the retirement funds, and our retirement system, our social
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.440]  security system is not solvent, nor is the medical care system.
[16:24.440 --> 16:28.760]  It sounds great, we're going to take care of you, it's an affordable care system.
[16:28.760 --> 16:33.240]  You know, the medical system we're having shoved down our throats is unaffordable care
[16:33.240 --> 16:40.920]  system, but the market will eventually rule, and people will have to face up to their predicament,
[16:40.920 --> 16:43.880]  and right now people are getting a little more nervous about the fact.
[16:43.880 --> 16:48.840]  You mean those poor people in Greece, they went along with it, and now all they want
[16:48.840 --> 16:54.400]  to do is get 100 bucks out a month to live on, and the government has capital controls,
[16:54.400 --> 16:56.440]  how much money you can take out.
[16:56.440 --> 17:02.760]  That has never worked in the past, it just causes the next country to try to beat the
[17:02.760 --> 17:07.640]  system, so there'll be other countries, including this country, people will try to get out of
[17:07.640 --> 17:10.160]  the system and maybe get their money out of the banks.
[17:10.160 --> 17:15.840]  Well, for me, that's what really shows us that we're getting close to the big event
[17:15.840 --> 17:20.960]  that you've been warning about coming closer, is that all over the west, elites are hoarding
[17:20.960 --> 17:25.120]  cash, holding gold, trying to restrict the public from doing it.
[17:25.120 --> 17:30.560]  The TSA announced next year, if the states don't have real ID, federally approved IDs,
[17:30.560 --> 17:34.200]  you won't be able to fly an internal passport.
[17:34.200 --> 17:40.080]  We now have, speaking of medical tyranny, forced inoculations bill signed in California.
[17:40.080 --> 17:44.600]  We've got the Supreme Court now legislating from the bench, clearly.
[17:44.600 --> 17:49.080]  It seems like the bottom is falling out, A, do you agree with that?
[17:49.080 --> 17:52.560]  And then B, where does it go from here?
[17:52.560 --> 18:03.200]  Well, yes, the bottom is falling out and this is the big problem because it's unsustainable
[18:03.200 --> 18:13.280]  and eventually the people will have to recognize this and something else has to change.
[18:13.280 --> 18:20.160]  The system is not viable, but there's always this willingness to try to profit up, like
[18:20.160 --> 18:23.560]  we did in 08 and 09, we propped it up.
[18:23.560 --> 18:29.720]  But the debt is illiquid, it's not worth anything, the sooner you liquidate the debt is better,
[18:29.720 --> 18:32.680]  you cannot preserve the debt.
[18:32.680 --> 18:37.440]  My argument is, and you alluded to this, is the fact that, you know, this is big problems
[18:37.440 --> 18:41.320]  for everybody and people are going to lose a lot of wealth and even some wealthy people
[18:41.320 --> 18:43.160]  are going to lose out.
[18:43.160 --> 18:47.960]  But everybody has to adjust to the fact that there will be a change and there will be a
[18:47.960 --> 18:51.840]  liquidation and there will be a living beneath our means.
[18:51.840 --> 18:55.440]  We've lived way beyond our means, but it's what we do about it.
[18:55.440 --> 18:58.360]  If we keep doing the wrong things, it will last too long.
[18:58.360 --> 19:03.360]  This is already this recession, which is really a depression, is lasting too long.
[19:03.360 --> 19:11.440]  So if we do this, what we have to preserve is our liberty because if we do, if we eliminate
[19:11.440 --> 19:16.000]  all our wealth and had our liberties where you just eliminate all those things you just
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.920]  listed here and what our government is going to do, we would be back on our feet rather
[19:19.920 --> 19:20.920]  shortly.
[19:20.920 --> 19:22.400]  But that's where the real crisis is.
[19:22.400 --> 19:27.400]  Now, if we don't build our strength on those individuals who know and understand what liberty
[19:27.400 --> 19:31.720]  is all about, we're going to lose our wealth, we're going to further lose our liberty and
[19:31.720 --> 19:35.280]  all this is going to be available with some guy walking in with a white horse and say,
[19:35.280 --> 19:36.680]  I'm in charge now.
[19:36.680 --> 19:41.360]  If you listen to what I'm going to do, I will deliver you from all the tragedy that exists.
[19:41.360 --> 19:45.720]  And it's not a man on a white horse that's going to save us, it's somebody who understands
[19:45.720 --> 19:52.720]  and gets that eight or 9% that's necessary to lead us in the ways of a more free society
[19:52.720 --> 19:53.920]  because that's what's count.
[19:53.920 --> 19:56.480]  So people shouldn't be discouraged and say, oh, this is overwhelming.
[19:56.480 --> 19:58.720]  How are you going to get 51% to give up their benefits?
[19:58.720 --> 20:04.240]  No, you're not going to, but you could get more people in leadership positions.
[20:04.240 --> 20:08.560]  And that's where I think we're making some progress, but we have a tough job ahead because
[20:08.560 --> 20:12.760]  we have to convince the majority of people that they cannot find their answers in more
[20:12.760 --> 20:13.760]  government.
[20:13.760 --> 20:18.640]  Former Congressman Ron Paul is our guest, the Institute for Peace and Prosperity.org.
[20:18.640 --> 20:22.920]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com, we've only got a few minutes left.
[20:22.920 --> 20:25.640]  Looking at this, I've brought up the whole issue and you brought up the issue of the
[20:25.640 --> 20:27.440]  financial crisis being front and center.
[20:27.440 --> 20:32.400]  But as you mentioned, historically, totalitarianism comes out of a collapse and then the countries
[20:32.400 --> 20:37.920]  never emerge out of their hellish existence.
[20:37.920 --> 20:44.280]  If we have some of our liberties intact, we can quickly bounce back, but also war follows
[20:44.280 --> 20:45.280]  that.
[20:45.280 --> 20:50.040]  And we have just extreme examples of funding radicals against Syria, funding radicals against
[20:50.040 --> 20:58.400]  Russia in Crimea, really aggressive, megalomaniacal, reckless actions by the governing elite.
[20:58.400 --> 21:01.440]  You've been up in Congress for many years, you've served the military.
[21:01.440 --> 21:05.440]  Is it just that we know more about it now, so it seems like the government's more out
[21:05.440 --> 21:08.320]  of control or is the government more out of control?
[21:08.320 --> 21:13.840]  Because it seems like on every front, they're just power grabbing as fast as they can.
[21:13.840 --> 21:17.400]  Texas is grabbing its gold from the Federal Reserve, the Germans want it back.
[21:17.400 --> 21:20.680]  I mean, if you look at what's going on, it looks like they're getting ready for something
[21:20.680 --> 21:21.680]  big.
[21:21.680 --> 21:25.240]  Yeah, and they are.
[21:25.240 --> 21:31.000]  And I think the worst things, guests, the more of this you'll see because they won't
[21:31.000 --> 21:32.000]  admit the problem.
[21:32.000 --> 21:37.360]  They won't admit that they don't have enough wealth and money to bribe everybody and give
[21:37.360 --> 21:38.600]  them benefits.
[21:38.600 --> 21:41.000]  And that's when it's coming to an end.
[21:41.000 --> 21:48.600]  And right now, we are facing that, and I think it is obviously going to be very, very serious.
[21:48.600 --> 21:53.680]  The governments will do what is necessary to maintain their control, but it can come
[21:53.680 --> 21:54.680]  out better.
[21:54.680 --> 21:59.360]  I know what you're talking about how so often this leads to war, and matter of fact, many
[21:59.360 --> 22:02.040]  people say, ah, thank goodness for FDR.
[22:02.040 --> 22:05.360]  He had this World War II and got us out of the Depression.
[22:05.360 --> 22:07.520]  What nonsense is that?
[22:07.520 --> 22:12.600]  But we had a revolution, and it's one of the rare things in history where the people who
[22:12.600 --> 22:17.280]  were involved in the revolution to beat the authoritarian actually ended up with more
[22:17.280 --> 22:18.280]  liberty.
[22:18.280 --> 22:24.400]  But if you look at what happened after World War I and the Depression and Hitler coming
[22:24.400 --> 22:27.960]  in charge and opening up the doors to communism.
[22:27.960 --> 22:32.360]  But the 20th century has proved that fascism and communism, you know, has failed.
[22:32.360 --> 22:37.600]  I think it's more apparent to the world that communism of the Stalin type has failed, and
[22:37.600 --> 22:42.720]  nobody's advocating that, but I'm frightened by the people who are carelessly drifting
[22:42.720 --> 22:43.720]  into this.
[22:43.720 --> 22:48.480]  Well, we need big government, big drug companies, big medicine, everybody in partnerships with
[22:48.480 --> 22:49.960]  the government.
[22:49.960 --> 22:54.120]  And that is where our biggest problem is, and too many people are going along with this,
[22:54.120 --> 22:56.200]  because you find that in both political parties.
[22:56.200 --> 23:04.440]  Yes, sir, in closing, looking at election 2016, Rand Paul in all the early polls and
[23:04.440 --> 23:10.760]  at CPAC year after year and in New Hampshire and other areas was leading.
[23:10.760 --> 23:17.080]  But by ignoring him and then the guy behind him, Ted Cruz, they have now basically in
[23:17.080 --> 23:20.680]  new polls focused on Jeb and Trump.
[23:20.680 --> 23:26.160]  And I think Trump clearly will get a bunch of more libertarian support and then drag
[23:26.160 --> 23:29.760]  it away from other candidates and then drop out for Jeb.
[23:29.760 --> 23:34.560]  And then Hillary's campaign head was at Bilderberg in Austria this year.
[23:34.560 --> 23:35.720]  We were there covering it.
[23:35.720 --> 23:38.000]  No one else from other candidates.
[23:38.000 --> 23:42.360]  So it looks like she's the one that they're pushing for.
[23:42.360 --> 23:47.840]  Is there any way you see in this upcoming election to reach out to the public and explain
[23:47.840 --> 23:53.120]  to them how they're being conned so that we can get a Senator Rand Paul?
[23:53.120 --> 23:59.760]  And I know he's your son, but Ted Cruz supported TPP, and I'm really upset with him about that.
[23:59.760 --> 24:02.080]  And your son, of course, valiantly didn't.
[24:02.080 --> 24:06.080]  And so they're doubling down on money against him, both Republicans and Democrats.
[24:06.080 --> 24:07.640]  I know you don't want to get involved in the election.
[24:07.640 --> 24:09.480]  You want to stay neutral on that.
[24:09.480 --> 24:15.200]  But just as an American watching another sickening spectacle, I mean, imagine President Hillary
[24:15.200 --> 24:19.720] ... Well, it's going to be a disaster, and they're
[24:19.720 --> 24:25.600]  pretty much in charge, and Rand is the alternative to the whole system, because he's the only
[24:25.600 --> 24:30.640]  one that's suggesting that we should have a less militaristic foreign policy.
[24:30.640 --> 24:35.240]  He's been on the right side of challenging the Federal Reserve system, and he's been
[24:35.240 --> 24:37.160]  good on civil liberties.
[24:37.160 --> 24:42.760]  But the establishment is very, very powerful, and we have to recognize that.
[24:42.760 --> 24:47.000]  And eventually, though, the only thing that really counts is reaching out and changing
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.360]  people's hearts and minds, and then the political system will reflect those changes.
[24:52.360 --> 24:57.200]  Right now, there are too many Americans who either don't care, don't pay attention, or
[24:57.200 --> 24:58.920]  think these wars are wonderful.
[24:58.920 --> 25:02.800]  But you mentioned the wars that are going on, and that contributes tremendously to our
[25:02.800 --> 25:07.480]  bankruptcy and tremendously to building enemies around the world.
[25:07.480 --> 25:11.880]  And when we get in worse financial shape, believe me, they're not going to be bashful
[25:11.880 --> 25:13.720]  about coming back at us.
[25:13.720 --> 25:21.000]  So right now, with all the candidates except Rand, they're only going to make things much
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.120]  worse as far as I'm concerned.
[25:23.120 --> 25:26.640]  It must be amazing after all your hard work and success promoting liberty to see your
[25:26.640 --> 25:33.600]  son being the only person out of a field of, like, 11 candidates who's been called radical
[25:33.600 --> 25:36.720]  just because 50 years ago he'd be called middle of the road.
[25:36.720 --> 25:42.080]  He's just promoting basic, sane, Americana ideas, and I hope and pray that we can get
[25:42.080 --> 25:43.080]  him the nomination.
[25:43.080 --> 25:47.920]  But regardless, running, he'll help educate people just like you did to tens of millions
[25:47.920 --> 25:50.480]  and the young people are waking up as well.
[25:50.480 --> 25:55.680]  Former Congressman Ron Paul, congratulations on your successful TV and radio shows and
[25:55.680 --> 25:57.320]  great job of your crew down there.
[25:57.320 --> 25:58.320]  Thank you for all your time.
[25:58.320 --> 25:59.320]  Thank you.
[25:59.320 --> 26:01.320]  Good to be with you.
[26:01.320 --> 26:02.320]  Have a great fourth.
[26:02.320 --> 26:03.320]  Wow.
[26:03.320 --> 26:09.320]  What a great present to the M4Wars audience to have Ron Paul, his first live video interview.
[26:09.320 --> 26:12.920]  He's been on with us since 1996, hundreds of times.
[26:12.920 --> 26:18.680]  First time he's been on with us live via video from his amazing studios, so just so exciting
[26:18.680 --> 26:19.680]  to have him on.
[26:19.680 --> 26:24.080]  Again, I don't get giddy when I meet professional football players or basketball players or
[26:24.080 --> 26:25.080]  even movie stars.
[26:25.080 --> 26:28.240]  And I know some of the biggest movie stars out there and it's interesting.
[26:28.240 --> 26:31.320]  It's fine, especially if you're a fan of them.
[26:31.320 --> 26:36.320]  But Ron Paul, I mean, that's founding father material right there.
[26:36.320 --> 26:38.840]  That's the real deal.
[26:38.840 --> 26:42.520]  Just a decent, honorable person.
[26:42.520 --> 26:47.000]  Look how good he looks at almost 80 if you're watching via the free feeds at M4Wars.com
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.680]  forward slash show.
[26:49.680 --> 26:54.620]  I mean, just a blessed man with a whole bunch of grandkids and standing up, working harder
[26:54.620 --> 27:00.880]  now than he ever did his mind sharper than ever.
[27:00.880 --> 27:05.720]  And then you compare that to the slobs at the Republican leadership and Democratic leadership
[27:05.720 --> 27:06.960]  that are selling this country out.
[27:06.960 --> 27:13.080]  And Ron Paul speaks every week to packed halls of sometimes 20,000 young people on average
[27:13.080 --> 27:14.080]  about 5,000.
[27:14.080 --> 27:19.800]  I mean, he's come to Austin and spoke outside when 20,000 people show up.
[27:19.800 --> 27:23.840]  That's the antidote to the young people that don't know what planet they're on.
[27:23.840 --> 27:25.600]  And I want to play again this clip.
[27:25.600 --> 27:28.280]  Mark Dice is up on dredgerport.com.
[27:28.280 --> 27:32.200]  Citizens don't know what country we succeeded from in 1776.
[27:32.200 --> 27:33.200]  Here it is.
[27:33.200 --> 27:36.280]  What are we celebrating on the 4th of July?
[27:36.280 --> 27:37.280]  Our independence.
[27:37.280 --> 27:40.360]  A little more specific.
[27:40.360 --> 27:46.440]  It's the day that we overtook the South and it's the day that it's our independence.
[27:46.440 --> 27:48.120]  That's why we have the fire from the South.
[27:48.120 --> 27:49.120]  From the South.
[27:49.120 --> 27:50.120]  Exactly.
[27:50.120 --> 27:51.120]  So it was the victor of the Civil War?
[27:51.120 --> 27:52.120]  Yes.
[27:52.120 --> 27:53.120]  4th of July?
[27:53.120 --> 27:54.120]  Yes.
[27:54.120 --> 28:01.120]  The Declaration of Independence was signed by who?
[28:01.120 --> 28:04.600]  I don't know.
[28:04.600 --> 28:05.600]  That's good.
[28:05.600 --> 28:07.680]  Fast forward to the last guy.
[28:07.680 --> 28:09.120]  They talked to an Italian guy.
[28:09.120 --> 28:10.920]  He had him like a professor.
[28:10.920 --> 28:11.920]  He's just a hip guy.
[28:11.920 --> 28:15.440]  And he goes, your revolution against Britain, against the Colonials.
[28:15.440 --> 28:17.040]  We all love this.
[28:17.040 --> 28:19.000]  The world loved it.
[28:19.000 --> 28:22.560]  Nobody had kicked the British's butt.
[28:22.560 --> 28:24.000]  They've beaten everybody.
[28:24.000 --> 28:31.320]  We defeated them because it basically was the colonies were British and German and basically
[28:31.320 --> 28:34.280]  Dutch folks and Irish and others.
[28:34.280 --> 28:38.040]  But the point was is that they'd been in a bunch of wars and then the British tried
[28:38.040 --> 28:40.280]  to enslave everybody and they said, no way.
[28:40.280 --> 28:41.880]  And the whole world marveled at that.
[28:41.880 --> 28:45.040]  And now Americans don't know why you have the 4th.
[28:45.040 --> 28:47.080]  Talk about dummies.
[28:47.080 --> 28:50.840]  But that's a group and those are the Democrats and that's who they've got on their side.
[28:50.840 --> 28:54.560]  I guarantee you, every one of those idiots is a hardcore Obama supporter.
[28:54.560 --> 28:56.120]  They just go with whatever's trendy.
[28:56.120 --> 28:57.120]  They love death panels.
[28:57.120 --> 28:58.120]  They love forced abortion.
[28:58.120 --> 29:01.400]  They love having their prices increased.
[29:01.400 --> 29:06.400]  When Obama says two plus two equals five, he's talking to his morons, his brain dead
[29:06.400 --> 29:07.400]  zombies.
[29:07.400 --> 29:08.400]  Let's go to that clip.
[29:08.400 --> 29:09.920]  It celebrates the 4th of July.
[29:09.920 --> 29:14.080]  Is it Independence Day when you got rid of Mother England, right?
[29:14.080 --> 29:15.080]  Yes.
[29:15.080 --> 29:16.080]  We got the borders.
[29:16.080 --> 29:17.080]  Only God.
[29:17.080 --> 29:20.760]  Well, everybody knows why we celebrate it more than Americans.
[29:20.760 --> 29:25.280]  Everybody loves to get rid of their, like, you know, like the colonizer, so it's good.
[29:25.280 --> 29:26.280]  That's incredible.
[29:26.280 --> 29:27.280]  It's always good.
[29:27.280 --> 29:28.280]  Thanks for knowing that.
[29:28.280 --> 29:29.280]  That's incredible, man.
[29:29.280 --> 29:30.280]  Have a good one.
[29:30.280 --> 29:31.280]  Have a good vacation.
[29:31.280 --> 29:32.280]  See ya.
[29:32.280 --> 29:33.280]  Don't laugh.
[29:33.280 --> 29:36.920]  Don't laugh.
[29:36.920 --> 29:38.840]  Because this is what they do to people in the public schools.
[29:38.840 --> 29:40.040]  They don't let the teachers teach.
[29:40.040 --> 29:41.040]  Don't blame them.
[29:41.040 --> 29:42.360]  This is what they teach.
[29:42.360 --> 29:49.680]  This is what they teach is ignorance.
[29:49.680 --> 29:53.400]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:53.400 --> 30:00.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.240 --> 30:06.080]  There is a shocking video posted right now at infowars.com where a man dies in a jail
[30:06.080 --> 30:09.400]  lobby after an encounter with sheriff's deputies.
[30:09.400 --> 30:14.560]  Surveillance footage released by the Sheriff's Department last Friday shows 48-year-old Arlington
[30:14.560 --> 30:20.240]  resident Joseph Hutchison frantically running inside the Dallas County Jail Lobby on August
[30:20.240 --> 30:21.240]  1.
[30:21.240 --> 30:25.560]  Witnesses say Hutchison was not violent, but he appeared distraught and was seeking
[30:25.560 --> 30:26.560]  help.
[30:26.560 --> 30:30.000]  He didn't have a weapon, and he wasn't swinging at the officers.
[30:30.000 --> 30:34.880]  Witnesses say a deputy threw Hutchison to the ground and put a knee to his throat.
[30:34.880 --> 30:38.240]  He couldn't breathe, and his face turned pale blue.
[30:38.240 --> 30:43.960]  After a few moments, he lied motionless as visitors continued to pour into the lobby.
[30:43.960 --> 30:47.640]  Witnesses are seen attempting to resuscitate him, but it was too late.
[30:47.640 --> 30:49.840]  Joseph Hutchison had died.
[30:49.840 --> 30:54.640]  His brother James is organizing a demonstration at the Dallas County Sheriff's Department
[30:54.640 --> 30:56.160]  building this evening.

[32:59.160 --> 33:18.480]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:18.480 --> 33:19.480]  the Info War.
[33:19.480 --> 33:33.720]  Dr. Elvita King is part of PriestsForLife.org, a bipartisan pro-life group.
[33:33.720 --> 33:36.840]  She, of course, is the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King.
[33:36.840 --> 33:41.880]  She's just joining us briefly here today, appreciate her popping in with us.
[33:41.880 --> 33:45.720]  She's got the new best-selling book, King's Rules on what Martin Luther King actually said
[33:45.720 --> 33:52.040]  on issues, not what the establishment spins and says he stood for, and I wanted to get
[33:52.040 --> 33:58.360]  her take on what he would think of Black Lives Matters now, basically getting mad at Democratic
[33:58.360 --> 33:59.960]  candidates that say all lives matter.
[33:59.960 --> 34:03.480]  I thought that's what Martin Luther King said in what Common Sense says, storming these
[34:03.480 --> 34:08.040]  events, taking them over, being Democratic Party funded, George Soros funded.
[34:08.040 --> 34:12.600]  What does she think is, you know, having a lot of savvy on how politics works is going
[34:12.600 --> 34:13.600]  on here?
[34:13.600 --> 34:18.160]  And how big a victory is it because she's a big opponent of, obviously, abortion that
[34:18.160 --> 34:22.760]  predominantly targets Blacks, 50-plus percent being aborted before they're born?
[34:22.760 --> 34:26.600]  What does she think about this Planned Parenthood news coming out?
[34:26.600 --> 34:31.040]  I mean, we've got four states cutting their funding, Congress looking at it.
[34:31.040 --> 34:34.320]  We've known this is going on for a while, but it really is good to see this evil being
[34:34.320 --> 34:35.320]  exposed.
[34:35.320 --> 34:38.520]  So, Dr. King, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[34:38.520 --> 34:43.680]  I am so glad to join you, and those are some wonderful questions and things that you pointed
[34:43.680 --> 34:44.680]  out.
[34:44.680 --> 34:48.440]  The first thing I thought, and you know I come from a family of preachers, Martin Luther
[34:48.440 --> 34:54.160]  King, Joe Luther King, my daddy's brother, A.D., my granddaddy, daddy King, I'm an evangelist,
[34:54.160 --> 35:01.040]  but there was a time in the Bible when there was a man named Joseph, and he became very
[35:01.040 --> 35:06.360]  well known to the Pharaoh after he went through persecution and all that.
[35:06.360 --> 35:12.080]  And then when he died, a new Pharaoh came, and then they said, they didn't remember Joseph.
[35:12.080 --> 35:15.640]  I'm thinking that some people don't even remember Martin Luther King, Jr., what he
[35:15.640 --> 35:21.320]  stood for, and of course, he stood for God, he was a man of God, he loved God, and a lot
[35:21.320 --> 35:26.440]  of people seem to have forgotten that, and that's why you can see young people running
[35:26.440 --> 35:32.360]  up, interrupting a meeting, yelling Black Lives Matter, and of course Black Lives Matter,
[35:32.360 --> 35:33.360]  all Lives Matter.
[35:33.360 --> 35:39.640]  Martin Luther King, Jr. often taught my daddy, A.D., his brother, to, at 1726, the blood
[35:39.640 --> 35:43.240]  and blood died and made all people, so were brothers and sisters, and Martin Luther King
[35:43.240 --> 35:46.880]  says, we have to learn to live together as brothers, and all that, as sisters will perish
[35:46.880 --> 35:47.880]  as fools.
[35:47.880 --> 35:53.080]  So, they don't remember that, and so they don't even know that it's disrespectful to
[35:53.080 --> 35:57.120]  go to a meeting and jump in the people's face and scream Black Lives Matter, that's
[35:57.120 --> 36:04.520]  disrespectful, but no one has taught them how to articulate a need, and because they
[36:04.520 --> 36:08.040]  don't know how they're doing it inappropriately.
[36:08.040 --> 36:14.840]  Well, we know the Democrats are directing them, and Nancy Pelosi and others, so it looks
[36:14.840 --> 36:19.640]  like they're trying to make the movement balkanize people, and look pretty silly as well.
[36:19.640 --> 36:24.760]  They even go to the most liberal Bernie Sanders, you name it, and get in their face.
[36:24.760 --> 36:28.360]  What do you think is really going on behind the scenes here, Dr. King?
[36:28.360 --> 36:34.200]  Well, what does envy and confusion, envy and strife, that's confusion in every evil
[36:34.200 --> 36:35.200]  work.
[36:35.200 --> 36:38.160]  If you can keep things confused and people can't think, they don't even notice.
[36:38.160 --> 36:42.000]  Well, then yelling at the Democrats and the Republicans, and then you wonder who's kind
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.840]  of behind the movement, who's paying them, because I can remember, you know, I was elected
[36:46.840 --> 36:51.760]  to office myself, I was a state legislator, two terms in Georgia, I've been a presidential
[36:51.760 --> 36:53.400]  appointee, and those kinds of things.
[36:53.400 --> 36:57.640]  So, when you're in a campaign, you pay people to stand on the corner with your signs, to
[36:57.640 --> 37:00.320]  walk up and down and pass out your flyers.
[37:00.320 --> 37:05.920]  Well, people don't only do that when someone's running for office, they do it to disturb
[37:05.920 --> 37:06.920]  a community.
[37:06.920 --> 37:10.760]  And so, you can give somebody a little money if they go out into the community and scream
[37:10.760 --> 37:13.720]  and jump up and down, and we'll give you some money, we'll give you lunch, we'll give you
[37:13.720 --> 37:14.720]  whatever.
[37:14.720 --> 37:20.920]  So, a lot of that has happened, and then sometimes young people especially, they'll see something
[37:20.920 --> 37:27.680]  and then they'll join in with all this zeal without even examining what the message is.
[37:27.680 --> 37:32.120]  And honestly, a lot of that's going on, and you're right, there are people who want anarchy
[37:32.120 --> 37:36.520]  and confusion so that they can continue to do things that they're doing and nobody will
[37:36.520 --> 37:37.520]  ask them any questions.
[37:37.520 --> 37:39.520]  And they want to study each other's throats.
[37:39.520 --> 37:44.840]  And they want to study each other's throats.
[37:44.840 --> 37:49.800]  We know Hillary has met with the folks and crowd to start things up, we know George Soros
[37:49.800 --> 37:53.840]  is doing it, and there are some real issues with the police in areas, but they're really
[37:53.840 --> 37:54.840]  trying to exacerbate it.
[37:54.840 --> 37:59.240]  And I think that's the desperation of the Democratic Party, not that the Republicans
[37:59.240 --> 38:02.680]  are much better, that all they've got now is divide and conquer.
[38:02.680 --> 38:06.280]  I mean, do you agree that that's a sign of desperation or do you think it's confidence?
[38:06.280 --> 38:08.480]  Well, I talk about frequency.
[38:08.480 --> 38:13.440]  So, the political frequency is real and you're there, but it's not so much whether you're
[38:13.440 --> 38:18.640]  a Republican or Democrat or an independent, but you have free thinking in person.
[38:18.640 --> 38:23.640]  Can you think, can you hear, can you reason, can you look at issues?
[38:23.640 --> 38:29.480]  And if you keep the battle going between the Republicans and the Democrats, that's one
[38:29.480 --> 38:30.980]  level in one place.
[38:30.980 --> 38:35.840]  But what I demand is that everybody, regardless of their political party, do what's right
[38:35.840 --> 38:36.840]  by people.
[38:36.840 --> 38:40.600]  And that's why I wrote to the Congressional Black Caucus, for example, and I said, are
[38:40.600 --> 38:41.600]  you paralyzed?
[38:41.600 --> 38:46.000]  All in the book of Fabbas, it says that justice is paralyzed, people are paralyzed and they
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.240]  can't even do what's right.
[38:48.240 --> 38:49.880]  Justice is perverted.
[38:49.880 --> 38:51.720]  And so what's your problem?
[38:51.720 --> 38:56.000]  Why can't you speak out and say that these things that are happening are wrong?
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.600]  A lot of time money does it.
[38:57.600 --> 38:59.760]  Like you say, people throw money at it.
[38:59.760 --> 39:04.120]  People who are wealthy enough to want to manipulate the agenda, they put enough money out there
[39:04.120 --> 39:07.520]  that people won't even hear what's right and what's wrong.
[39:07.520 --> 39:11.960]  And have you ever seen those movies or things like that and somebody wants to go into a
[39:11.960 --> 39:15.960]  community and the crowd is too thick, so they just take a handful of coins or a handful
[39:15.960 --> 39:19.840]  of dollars and throw them up in the air and the people just first chasing them out.
[39:19.840 --> 39:20.840]  Yes.
[39:20.840 --> 39:21.840]  And then they can go wherever they want to go.
[39:21.840 --> 39:26.320]  Well, then this is exactly that analogy, that's what's happening.
[39:26.320 --> 39:32.000]  They've got us fighting over crumbs while they social engineer the planet.
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.800]  How positive an event, even though it's painful, is it, what do you think of all these abortion
[39:36.800 --> 39:41.280]  videos coming out and the fact that they're shelling baby parts, what looks like on the
[39:41.280 --> 39:42.280]  illegal market?
[39:42.280 --> 39:47.440]  Well, I hope your listeners are really listening because it's very painful for me because I'm
[39:47.440 --> 39:48.440]  post-aborted.
[39:48.440 --> 39:49.440]  I had abortions.
[39:49.440 --> 39:55.640]  And when I had those abortions, I was one who sat there and was rushed in and had papers
[39:55.640 --> 40:01.680]  shoved into my hands and as they shoved the papers into my hand signed this week.
[40:01.680 --> 40:07.120]  And I'm already not sure, I'm trying to do it in secret, all of that.
[40:07.120 --> 40:09.720]  And then they said, you've got to sign this, you've got to do that.
[40:09.720 --> 40:15.000]  So it is painful, but you know, and there's another video out today, I don't know if you
[40:15.000 --> 40:16.000]  see it.
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.120]  It's called, call him Emmett, E-M-M-E-T-T, talking about Emmett Till, who in the 20th
[40:20.120 --> 40:26.440]  century had asked an American young teen was killed for supposedly looking at a Caucasian
[40:26.440 --> 40:27.440]  girl.
[40:27.440 --> 40:30.920]  And his mother said, leave the coffin open because people need to see what happened to
[40:30.920 --> 40:31.920]  my child.
[40:31.920 --> 40:36.640]  And so Martin Luther King Jr. said, America will not reject racism until America sees
[40:36.640 --> 40:37.640]  racism.
[40:37.640 --> 40:43.480]  I'm Frank Pavone, and I'm Director of African American Outreach for Priests for Life with
[40:43.480 --> 40:44.480]  Fr.
[40:44.480 --> 40:45.480]  Frank as a National Director.
[40:45.480 --> 40:46.480]  Fr.
[40:46.480 --> 40:50.480]  Frank says America will not reject abortion until America sees abortion.
[40:50.480 --> 40:56.640]  So even though I sit there and I think, oh my God, did I sign that for my own baby?
[40:56.640 --> 41:00.760]  And you think about it, but I still say people need to see it.
[41:00.760 --> 41:02.800]  You know, I'm looking at it as hard.
[41:02.800 --> 41:06.440]  Sometimes I have to look away for a second and look back.
[41:06.440 --> 41:09.800]  America has had five smooth songs.
[41:09.800 --> 41:13.840]  This time, the Center for Medical Progress had five piercing videos.
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.680]  The first five videos ripped the top off of this thing, and from there on, the videos
[41:19.680 --> 41:21.320]  are still coming now.
[41:21.320 --> 41:22.800]  So we do have to see them.
[41:22.800 --> 41:24.680]  They are hard to look at.
[41:24.680 --> 41:29.520]  But if we don't see the truth, our hearts won't be pricked.
[41:29.520 --> 41:32.480]  And so I believe that the videos have to be seen.
[41:32.480 --> 41:37.160]  Dr. Elvita King is our guest, priestforlife.org.
[41:37.160 --> 41:41.280]  The good news is they tried to get the courts to block the release of these videos.
[41:41.280 --> 41:42.760]  That's failed.
[41:42.760 --> 41:48.280]  We now know even more horrific videos are coming out, and it just shows Planned Parenthood
[41:48.280 --> 41:49.960]  and others are not invincible.
[41:49.960 --> 41:54.080]  I think we're very close to seeing the fall of Hillary Planned Parenthood.
[41:54.080 --> 41:55.080]  You name it.
[41:55.080 --> 41:56.080]  If we just continue to push.
[41:56.080 --> 41:57.080]  I believe so.
[41:57.080 --> 41:58.080]  I believe so.
[41:58.080 --> 42:00.680]  There's a book about a single abortion by Fr.
[42:00.680 --> 42:03.600]  Clavone that just dropped yesterday.
[42:03.600 --> 42:09.200]  He's given a backdrop and 20 points of things that we can all do now that we've seen all
[42:09.200 --> 42:10.200]  this.
[42:10.200 --> 42:13.200]  So sometimes if you see something, if you feel hopeless, if you don't have anything
[42:13.200 --> 42:14.200]  you can do about it.
[42:14.200 --> 42:19.840]  So he's given some how-tos and some lasting things that we all can and can do.
[42:19.840 --> 42:24.840]  I've got a book too, King Rules, R-U-L-E-S-K-I-N-G, R-U-L-E-S.
[42:24.840 --> 42:27.440]  And I talk about my own abortion experience in there.
[42:27.440 --> 42:28.440]  Fr.
[42:28.440 --> 42:34.520]  Clavone didn't ask for it for me, and so we need to read, study, get involved, participate
[42:34.520 --> 42:35.520]  in this alone.
[42:35.520 --> 42:36.520]  I agree, Dr. King.
[42:36.520 --> 42:37.520]  Don't forget that.
[42:37.520 --> 42:43.040]  Dr. King, we're simulcasting, interrupt, I apologize, video, we're part TV, not just
[42:43.040 --> 42:45.520]  radio, and the guys roll footage in the background.
[42:45.520 --> 42:49.560]  The new video out today is them harvesting the babies, getting their organs, their different
[42:49.560 --> 42:54.960]  parts, and their little eyes and their little bodies could, God, excuse me.
[42:54.960 --> 42:56.600]  I tell you, it's hard to see.
[42:56.600 --> 42:57.600]  It's hard to see.
[42:57.600 --> 42:58.600]  I haven't seen this new one yet.
[42:58.600 --> 43:01.000]  I knew it was up, and I didn't want to look at it.
[43:01.000 --> 43:02.880]  They're poor little heads and little eyes.
[43:02.880 --> 43:06.280]  Is that the lady who had to go and cut the brain?
[43:06.280 --> 43:07.280]  Yeah.
[43:07.280 --> 43:12.600]  I mean, cut the face, get the brain, that's hard, that's hard, that's hard.
[43:12.600 --> 43:13.600]  I know.
[43:13.600 --> 43:14.600]  It's hard.
[43:14.600 --> 43:15.600]  I'm sorry, it's hard.
[43:15.600 --> 43:17.080]  Well, no, you were talking about it.
[43:17.080 --> 43:19.360]  I hadn't seen it yet, and then boom and hit.
[43:19.360 --> 43:21.920]  What do you make of these manly women?
[43:21.920 --> 43:27.560]  What do you make of these weird, liberal-type, fake, women all gulping wine at fine restaurants?
[43:27.560 --> 43:29.440]  Bragging about all the body parts.
[43:29.440 --> 43:32.000]  I mean, how sickening is how callous they are?
[43:32.000 --> 43:33.000]  They're desensitized.
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.800]  That's why they have to drink the wine, because they're desensitized.
[43:36.800 --> 43:40.080]  And the only way they can go to sleep, probably, is to get a stiff drink.
[43:40.080 --> 43:45.480]  I mean, how are you going to keep your heart anesthetized unless you continue to do it?
[43:45.480 --> 43:48.200]  You know, that's really, so I feel for them.
[43:48.200 --> 43:49.200]  I feel pain.
[43:49.200 --> 43:50.200]  I'm sorry.
[43:50.200 --> 43:58.320]  I pray that they can get to a place where they can live with themselves again.
[43:58.320 --> 44:06.120]  Don't people at a fundamental level get, just use this term, how bad a luck it is?
[44:06.120 --> 44:08.520]  And I use that term, even if you're not a Christian, you get it.
[44:08.520 --> 44:13.040]  At a fundamental level, it just feels like bad luck for everybody to be doing this to
[44:13.040 --> 44:14.040]  babies.
[44:14.040 --> 44:16.560]  Don't people know it's going to come back on us?
[44:16.560 --> 44:18.560]  No, people don't know.
[44:18.560 --> 44:24.680]  I remember when I was young, I was about a 65th birthday coming up, and I remember,
[44:24.680 --> 44:28.880]  my mind was, oh yeah, I understand, I hear that happens to people, but it won't happen.
[44:28.880 --> 44:33.880]  You know, you can always tell yourself that, so it happens, and then you sit there and
[44:33.880 --> 44:34.880]  say, how did this happen?
[44:34.880 --> 44:35.880]  Don't you remember?
[44:35.880 --> 44:37.880]  Maybe that did happen to you when you were young.
[44:37.880 --> 44:40.520]  Sure, it's like people I know that smoke cigarettes, and then they don't believe they're going
[44:40.520 --> 44:43.640]  to get lung cancer when they get it, they just can't believe it.
[44:43.640 --> 44:46.040]  And then how did this happen, you know?
[44:46.040 --> 44:50.640]  And so, that is part of the human nature as well, and that's why we have to do a lot of
[44:50.640 --> 44:51.640]  praying.
[44:51.640 --> 44:55.720]  I am a Christian, obviously, but what I say to anybody, whether you're a Christian, not
[44:55.720 --> 45:00.920]  a Christian, is there anybody, well, no, obviously there are people, because there's
[45:00.920 --> 45:02.920]  swilling wine and talking about it.
[45:02.920 --> 45:07.680]  I was going to say, is anybody, is anybody who can't see how bad that is, but obviously
[45:07.680 --> 45:10.960]  there are some who are still in a place like this.
[45:10.960 --> 45:11.960]  Absolutely.
[45:11.960 --> 45:14.680]  Well, the good news is, as you know, the Bible says there's nothing hidden that won't be
[45:14.680 --> 45:17.280]  brought out, even from the deepest depths of the sea.
[45:17.280 --> 45:18.280]  It's coming out.
[45:18.280 --> 45:22.920]  I know you've got a new song out, too, exposing a lot of this priesthood life.
[45:22.920 --> 45:23.920]  Pray for America.
[45:23.920 --> 45:24.920]  Pray for America.
[45:24.920 --> 45:25.920]  That's the song.
[45:25.920 --> 45:30.200]  You can see that at AfricanAmericanOutreach.com, right at the top.
[45:30.200 --> 45:31.200]  There's a music video.
[45:31.200 --> 45:35.600]  You click on that, and then you can order it online the whole song, I think, somewhere.
[45:35.600 --> 45:40.480]  Well, I hope you'll come back with us and take calls for a longer interview in the future.
[45:40.480 --> 45:44.920]  Thanks for Life.org. Keep up the great work, Dr. Elvita C. King.
[45:44.920 --> 45:45.920]  God bless you.
[45:45.920 --> 45:46.920]  God bless you.
[45:46.920 --> 45:48.760]  Thank you for this opportunity.
[45:48.760 --> 45:49.760]  Thank you.
[45:49.760 --> 45:50.760]  Bye.
[45:50.760 --> 45:57.520]  Oh, man, that really just freaked me out, because I wasn't ready for it.
[45:57.520 --> 46:02.880]  And I'll be honest, I don't watch a lot of the war videos of kids bombed and dead.
[46:02.880 --> 46:09.080]  There was one I saw just the other day by accident in Syria, where the roof had fallen
[46:09.080 --> 46:12.280]  in on a father and his daughters in his arms.
[46:12.280 --> 46:13.880]  She's about six or seven.
[46:13.880 --> 46:16.120]  I got a seven-year-old daughter, and she's crushed.
[46:16.120 --> 46:20.040]  You can see them holding her, and you can tell they died together suffocating under
[46:20.040 --> 46:25.160]  the rock, and it just gets to me.
[46:25.160 --> 46:28.560]  And I just can't imagine people that don't have that empathy.
[46:28.560 --> 46:33.360]  It's like my nerve endings, what happens to somebody else happens to me.
[46:33.360 --> 46:39.800]  And I think about that bowl of little kids, and they're pretty good-sized.
[46:39.800 --> 46:44.400]  These look like about four or five-month-old babies, and they're little heads and little
[46:44.400 --> 46:48.120]  eyes and little faces, and they're chopping, they're taking the brains out.
[46:48.120 --> 46:55.320]  And I tell people 20 years ago, they were putting baby brains in pigs, cows, rats, dogs,
[46:55.320 --> 46:57.360]  you name it.
[46:57.360 --> 46:58.360]  People didn't believe me.
[46:58.360 --> 46:59.360]  Now it's all in the news.
[46:59.360 --> 47:00.360]  It's just so crazy.
[47:00.360 --> 47:07.240]  That's what I mean, and we're got Lewis Farrakhan running around, and David Duke running around
[47:07.240 --> 47:12.240]  the hall, and yes, whites are racist, some of them, and blacks are racist, and Hispanics
[47:12.240 --> 47:15.880]  are in groups, and the media's hyping it, and so it's real.
[47:15.880 --> 47:20.520]  The real perspective of Lewis Farrakhan or David Duke, I mean, I get their perspective
[47:20.520 --> 47:26.120]  from their perspective, but you pull back from it, it's so fantastical what's really
[47:26.120 --> 47:34.800]  going on, the evil transcends what they can even cover, and it's happening to everybody.
[47:34.800 --> 47:39.440]  I think that's the biggest lie, is everybody thinks they're getting screwed over, or they're
[47:39.440 --> 47:41.440]  screwing somebody over, they're exempt.
[47:41.440 --> 47:42.440]  You're not exempt.
[47:42.440 --> 47:47.320]  You don't get away with anything you do in this world, and I just don't know how people
[47:47.320 --> 47:58.160]  don't see that or know that, or why you'd even need to know that metaphysical rule.
[47:58.160 --> 48:00.560]  I'm going to go to your phone calls, I apologize.
[48:00.560 --> 48:02.440]  Kenny and then Brandon and then others.
[48:02.440 --> 48:06.680]  Kenny, thanks for holding in Florida, Ventura's gone now, but go ahead, your point.
[48:06.680 --> 48:11.200]  Yeah, great show today, Alex, and I wanted to plug this Pro Pure Water Field Pressure
[48:11.200 --> 48:12.200]  to this.
[48:12.200 --> 48:14.960]  Fuck good, it makes the best sweet tea, and I even make my ice cubes out of it.
[48:14.960 --> 48:16.440]  Well, God bless you, thanks for the support.
[48:16.440 --> 48:23.880]  Yeah, man, I just, according to WorldNet Daily, since 9-11, 2001, an average of 26 American
[48:23.880 --> 48:28.520]  citizens are killed every day in this country, and if you do the math by illegal aliens, it's
[48:28.520 --> 48:34.600]  a well over 130,000 dead, over a million sexual assaults, mostly against children, and I just
[48:34.600 --> 48:39.600]  wanted to ask him how many is too many, and if he puts illegals before American citizens,
[48:39.600 --> 48:41.840]  I'm done with Justin Ventura.
[48:41.840 --> 48:46.920]  Well, Ventura's got a real liberal streak in him that he just wants to like everybody,
[48:46.920 --> 48:53.840]  and he gets that the welfare is wrong and it's a draw, but he, I'm trying to get him
[48:53.840 --> 48:57.960]  to, he's moved a little bit, and I think it's, next time he's on, I'm going to go over statistics
[48:57.960 --> 49:03.960]  with him, and I'm actually going to go over those numbers with him, and just say, look,
[49:03.960 --> 49:07.320]  we're not saying we're the Statue of Liberty, we're not saying we don't like Mexicans, that's
[49:07.320 --> 49:12.560]  not even the biggest group now, Chinese women, Russian women, African women, I don't care,
[49:12.560 --> 49:17.040]  should be able to come here and get everything free, and by the way, the illegals do work,
[49:17.040 --> 49:21.720]  but a lot of them game the system and get welfare and then work, and Walmart does it,
[49:21.720 --> 49:26.560]  Walmart tells us employees, we pay you enough where you can still get welfare, go out and
[49:26.560 --> 49:33.480]  get assistance, we then subsidize Walmart, not paying people living wage, so I hear what
[49:33.480 --> 49:39.480]  you're saying, and Ventura is wrong on that front, and he's wrong on abortion, go ahead,
[49:39.480 --> 49:40.480]  anything else?
[49:40.480 --> 49:44.680]  That's about it, brother, keep up the good work, we love you, man, we pray for you.
[49:44.680 --> 49:48.800]  God bless you, you know, I guarantee you that if I get Ventura and make him look at partial
[49:48.800 --> 49:56.160]  birth abortions, I'll get him to stop his views and everything, and he is a real libertarian,
[49:56.160 --> 49:59.760]  that's really what Ventura is, and he's a good guy, he doesn't like the new order, he
[49:59.760 --> 50:04.080]  poses 9-11, he got kicked off MSNBC and millions of dollars because he wouldn't show up about
[50:04.080 --> 50:08.480]  the war being wrong, I mean, he's good on many areas, he's a moral person from his
[50:08.480 --> 50:09.480]  perspective.
[50:09.480 --> 50:16.720]  We're gonna go to Bright, come back with Brandon, and then Anthony, Tim, Barry and others,
[50:16.720 --> 50:19.880]  I wish I wouldn't have seen that video, but you know what, good job guys playing it, because
[50:19.880 --> 50:24.760]  after I saw it, I said, you know what, roll it again, and go to infowars.com and you look
[50:24.760 --> 50:29.080]  at this video for yourself, and you know, if anybody tries to censor it on YouTube, which
[50:29.080 --> 50:35.480]  they've been doing, if dead babies getting harvested is obscene, why is it happening?
[50:35.480 --> 50:43.240]  We're not obscene showing it, you're obscene doing it, and I just repent to God Almighty
[50:43.240 --> 50:49.080]  that I didn't do enough to stop the abortions that I've been involved in, and then my heart
[50:49.080 --> 50:53.640]  and soul just says, that's alright, in the end, you know, you're gonna be tested and
[50:53.640 --> 50:58.440]  you're gonna pay for what you've done, hopefully only in this life, I know God's got plans
[50:58.440 --> 51:00.440]  for me, I'll pay, don't worry.

[52:03.880 --> 52:08.640]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[52:08.640 --> 52:11.120]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[52:11.120 --> 52:15.800]  But with a trusted big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[53:47.440 --> 53:50.080]  They just don't have enough nutrition to do the job.

[54:37.560 --> 54:42.880]  See, the more hardcore the globalists get, the more we're going to play hardball.
[54:42.880 --> 54:50.720]  Evil people always make the mistake of thinking good people are weak and are cowards.
[54:50.720 --> 54:55.640]  And the truth is, once good people know that they're cornered, they will tear evil people
[54:55.640 --> 54:58.160]  to pieces.
[54:58.160 --> 55:03.760]  And we're not going to be anything violent to these abortuaries.
[55:03.760 --> 55:11.120]  We're going to expose what you're doing and politically destroy you.
[55:11.120 --> 55:16.600]  And I can feel as the evil intensifies in the world, good is growing stronger as well.
[55:16.600 --> 55:19.120]  For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[55:19.120 --> 55:20.480]  Be part of the solution, folks.
[55:20.480 --> 55:24.560]  We're in an epic time right now, the beginning of something that's just going to get more
[55:24.560 --> 55:29.120]  and more epic.
[55:29.120 --> 55:36.880]  It's just so exciting in a good way and a bad way.
[55:36.880 --> 55:42.240]  I don't know how anybody could be bored right now.
[55:42.240 --> 55:44.440]  Brandon in FEMA Region 3, thanks for holding.
[55:44.440 --> 55:46.800]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[55:46.800 --> 55:48.800]  Good, brother.
[55:48.800 --> 55:56.880]  I wanted to touch on the growing police state, by the way, I'm a Marine Corps reservist.
[55:56.880 --> 56:02.360]  When I shot video on my phone about a month ago, I was driving down 95 and I could see
[56:02.360 --> 56:08.240]  what was clearly about 11 or 12 black hots in the air and they actually had a few streets
[56:08.240 --> 56:14.040]  blocked off and I walked up and just wanted to know what's going on and one of the Army
[56:14.040 --> 56:19.280]  guys, he had a Ranger tab on his shoulder, basically told me to shut up and get back.
[56:19.280 --> 56:24.160]  And I mean, the more and more I see this, it makes me sick to my stomach because it's
[56:24.160 --> 56:25.440]  not what I signed up for.
[56:25.440 --> 56:29.440]  Sure, and it's not the military itself's bad, they're being given these missions to
[56:29.440 --> 56:30.440]  condition the public.
[56:30.440 --> 56:36.520]  I never even covered Watson's article in California where they had thousands of troops total,
[56:36.520 --> 56:42.760]  but hundreds in trucks practicing in plain clothes, infiltrating, taking over the town
[56:42.760 --> 56:43.880]  and then leaving.
[56:43.880 --> 56:48.440]  They're practicing attacking American cities for America.
[56:48.440 --> 56:54.520]  And Alex, it's not even, notice, and I can even attest to myself when these drills occur,
[56:54.520 --> 56:58.840]  it's never about that jihadi with 50 pounds of C4 shot to his chest, it's about that good
[56:58.840 --> 57:02.520]  old boy in a John Deere hat who doesn't want to turn his hands in.
[57:02.520 --> 57:05.880]  So you've been in the Marines, I videotaped this with the Marines, but in the Marines
[57:05.880 --> 57:09.240]  you have trained to take on, I mean, I've been to the drills, they always wear John
[57:09.240 --> 57:13.480]  Deere hats and go, oh, America, don't take my guns, and the Marines practice taking
[57:13.480 --> 57:14.480]  them out.
[57:14.480 --> 57:15.480]  You're saying you've been part of that?
[57:15.480 --> 57:22.200]  I've been part of it, I've seen it firsthand and I mean, to a lot of the guys in the corn
[57:22.200 --> 57:25.280]  and all branches, it's like, is this even America anymore?
[57:25.280 --> 57:30.000]  We're training to kill our own people if they don't do whatever the government says.
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.680]  And you know, you've touched on it millions of times, same in the FBI and the CIA's compartmentalized
[57:35.680 --> 57:41.800]  at the mid and highest level, especially at the Pentagon, I mean, I'm the son of a U.S.
[57:41.800 --> 57:47.640]  Army general, and he's even told me, you know, you either play ball or they can say giving
[57:47.640 --> 57:49.680]  resignation and have a good life, you know.
[57:49.680 --> 57:52.400]  Briefly, where were you specifically with these drills?
[57:52.400 --> 57:57.160]  Were they in real cities or practice cities where you were practicing taking on veterans
[57:57.160 --> 57:58.160]  or patriots?
[57:58.160 --> 58:00.160]  Who were you practicing to take on and where was it?
[58:00.160 --> 58:08.040]  This was a few years ago, this was, I mean, it was in Virginia, just a little, I guess
[58:08.040 --> 58:11.040]  about 10 minutes outside of Richmond.
[58:11.040 --> 58:13.360]  Was it in a drill facility or in a town?
[58:13.360 --> 58:15.360]  It was in plain sight.
[58:15.360 --> 58:16.360]  Yeah, it was in a town.
[58:16.360 --> 58:20.600]  No, I mean, I know, because I've shot or had shot for me probably, let's not exaggerate,
[58:20.600 --> 58:27.480]  40 times video of Marines practicing to confiscate guns from South Texas to Hebron, Maryland.
[58:27.480 --> 58:28.480]  It's all on video.
[58:28.480 --> 58:31.440]  That's powerful info right there and powerful testimony.
[58:31.440 --> 58:36.200]  We know it's true, but just to hear it from the guys that are doing it, I mean, this is
[58:36.200 --> 58:37.200]  real.
[58:37.200 --> 58:38.200]  This is crazy.
[58:38.200 --> 58:50.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.

[59:52.720 --> 01:00:06.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:10.920]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.920]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.080]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:26.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:32.200]  Coming into the next segment, Joe Beggs, who went out and spoke hand last year, was going
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:39.560]  to be in studio with us with State Rep Matt Shea of Washington State.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:45.320]  The Bizarro Sheriff has been up to it again, and again, we're not covering just what one
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.880]  sheriff's doing.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.680]  This is what the federal training has done.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:01:01.920]  It's why I have clips from Ohio, from Indiana, from Michigan, from Washington, and others
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:08.560]  saying, we have the MRAPs, the armored vehicles for the Constitutionalist, and we have those
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:15.160]  clips coming up in the next segment, and we have the special reports, police, armored
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.520]  military vehicles needed for Constitutionalist with firearms.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:23.200]  We point out they're preparing for war, and then they put out disinfo stories, oh, Jones
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.480]  says martial law is going to happen by September 15th under J. Helm, and they're going to confiscate
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.480]  your guns.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.480]  No, I didn't.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.040]  I said they're training to confiscate our guns.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.240]  That's in the Army times.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.080]  It happened during Katrina.
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.560]  Stop acting like this isn't happening.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:43.160]  Remember, like five, six years ago, there's no such thing as a TPP.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.960]  There's no such thing as an Atlantic, transatlantic agreement between the NAU and the EU.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.480]  There is no global government.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.600]  There is no carbon tax.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:59.200]  I have Al Gore in 2007 in Congress in my film Endgame looking at the camera and saying,
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.600]  there is no plan for a carbon tax.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.880]  None of these initiatives are going to do with it, and they're like, but you own the
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.640]  company that's going to have the carbon credits, and Al Gore goes, and you also believe there
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.080]  was no moon landing?
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.880]  Now, notice now, it's all admitted, all out in the open, the pope calling for it.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.360]  A bunch of countries have it.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.080]  They're ramming it through here, but Al Gore will still come out and say, there is no carbon
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.080]  tax.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.080]  There is no income tax.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.160]  Two plus two equals five.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.120]  If you have a business, you didn't build it.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.560]  Joe Biden's not going to come after any of your guns.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.000]  Remember those speeches?
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.880]  They are a pack of criminal liars, but it comes down to us.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:50.320]  We are to blame for the fact that we are so tolerant of this.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.160]  We're going to go to Breik and come back and go over all of this.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.120]  Briefly, he didn't plug anything last hour.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.360]  Both shows plug every segment.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:03.880]  The reason I say that is it's important to support InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:08.800]  is a subdivision of that with the high quality nutraceuticals, because that's what funds
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.880]  about 70% of our operation.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:16.800]  Then we've got sponsorship and PrisonPlanet.tv, and quite frankly, we're going to have to
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.920]  do some fundraising here to be able to fund the next year, especially with the economy
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.920]  being in trouble.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:22.920]  Everybody sees it.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.920]  Everybody feels it.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.720]  I know it's hard to support us for a lot of people.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.320]  Products that have means in our upper middle class are wealthy.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:34.400]  You're really crazy if you don't start supporting outfits that are fighting for liberty.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:39.600]  But regardless, whether you're a working man or filthy rich, we have products everybody
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.440]  needs and should use, like Survival Shield, Nathan I and I, and X2, Game Changer, Oxy
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.320]  Powder to Flush Out Your Upper and Lower Intestines, Game Changer, Prostaguard, the
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:56.440]  highest quality formulation, lowest price out there for a high quality nutraceutical
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.480]  that targets healthy prostate.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.480]  We also have Silver Bullet that I'm not going to sell out of Silver Bullet this time, because
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.200]  it's going to be months and months until we get more.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.360]  I've calculated what it'll take to sell out at regular price over the next two months.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:15.280]  I'm going to sell what we've got, and then I'm going to cut off and keep enough back
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.920]  at the regular price so we don't sell out by the middle of October.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:25.120]  This will probably sell out by Thursday or Friday, and by sell out the amount we have
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.560]  to sell discounted.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:30.560]  30% off one bottle or buy two, get two free.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:33.880]  This is already the highest quality, lowest price out there.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:34.880]  Okay?
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.520]  So, you buy two, get two free.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:40.840]  You're talking about enough to use currently in a long-term supply.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.680]  It's storage for many years.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.560]  You cannot find a better deal, and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.360]  Get two Silver Bullets, colloidal silver, 30 parts per million, get two free, or get
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:05:00.080]  one bottle, 30% off infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:04.640]  Will Donald Trump sign the GOP pledge precluding a third-party run?
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.720]  According to a close associate, the GOP candidate intends to sign the loyalty pledge that would
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:14.680]  bind him to endorse the Republican nominee and would preclude him at third-party run.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:18.920]  The Republican National Committee has made it clear that they want every candidate running
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:24.120]  for nomination to sign a pledge not to break off and run as a third-party candidate under
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.800]  any circumstances.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:30.520]  The GOP is worried that third-party campaigns will jeopardize the party's chances against
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.480]  the eventual Democratic presidential candidate.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:38.040]  And as he's currently the most popular candidate, the GOP is concerned that Donald Trump may
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:42.640]  break off from the pact, and he has repeatedly threatened to do so.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.760]  Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul reminded everyone that it was Ross Perot who
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:51.400]  ended up giving us the first Clinton, and if Trump breaks off, he could give us another
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.400]  Clinton.

[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:08.680]  enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:12.720]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:17.080]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.

[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:16.480]  Available at infowarslife.com He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:45.800]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, now well into the second hour of the worldwide broadcast.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:50.720]  We have Gerald Salente, Trends Forecaster, joining us to talk about China's sliding
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:57.160]  again yet today, the Federal Reserve coming in and propping up the stock market.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.400]  China did that three weeks ago.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.880]  It worked a little bit.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.120]  Now the free falls back.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.880]  We expect to see that same trend here.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:08.120]  We wish the stock market wouldn't go down, but it's way overvalued.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:12.400]  So we'll be breaking that down in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:17.600]  So coming up, we're going to play clips of the latest chilling Planned Parenthood video
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:24.480]  released today, I guess the eighth video, that has them joking about trying to buy 50 baby
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:28.560]  livers a week and the fact that sometimes they're getting ripped off and they're only
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:32.520]  blood clots and they say, you know, what's happening are the dead babies crawling out
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.200]  of their containers?
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:39.600]  You know, where are the organs and making all sorts of sickening statements and that
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:45.160]  dovetails with footage, CNS, News Scott of Satanist in Detroit who've put up a bathroom
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:50.000]  at statue going around in support of Planned Parenthood.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.640]  And just no matter where you go, Satanists just appear.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.280]  I'm telling you, go out, demonstrate, announce you're doing it.
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:02.640]  Every time I've done it for 20 years, and I've only done it probably 16, 17 times, Satanists
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.640]  have shown up.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:07.120]  They'll come over and say, you know, I worship Satan, we're going to kill you, we're going
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.480]  to get you, or we kill babies, you're never going to stop us and stick their tongues out.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:16.640]  And the thing is, they're so weak, you know why they worship such a pathetic creature
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.640]  as Satan.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:22.200]  Whether you believe in Satan or not, a lot of serial killers worship the devil.
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.520]  So it shows the mental illness.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:30.760]  Now joining us till about 45 after, our state rep Matt Shea, voteShea.com, is his website
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.760]  and Joe Biggs.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:38.760]  Joe Biggs last year went out to Spokane because it was national news when we played a clip
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.200]  of the sheriff's deputy and the SWAT team at a Walmart saying we have this MRAP for
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:48.680]  constitutionalists and people who are stockpiling guns, who statistically have the lowest crime
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.680]  rates in the country.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.760]  Look it up.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:55.360]  And then we have other clips from Indiana and Ohio and Michigan and you name it.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.360]  Same thing.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.040]  This is the federal talking point.
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:04.680]  We've been given armored vehicles for the veterans, for the gun owners, for the Christians,
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.280]  for the constitutionalists.
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.440]  That's national news.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:15.080]  So six, and now it's seven members of the legislature, are really great patriots.
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:18.560]  They even wear the M4 1776 pen.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.560]  They sent me a photo of that.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.560]  It was awesome.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.560]  We had to dig that up from their Twitter and put it up.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.880]  I forgot to tell the guys about it.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.400]  And there's just so much data to go over here.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.000]  I could talk a million miles an hour.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.720]  It's better that I just turn it over to Joe Biggs, turn it over to Representative Shea,
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.760]  and also turn it over to the sheriff himself.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:39.200]  We're not going to play the whole thing, but when we played this video, he came out and
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.640]  said we're liars, that it was it for constitutionalists.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.480]  And then he came out and said that Info Wars was death-threading him.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:55.200]  And then in his next breath said, that's why we need the armored vehicles for the constitutionalists.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:01.320]  So this guy is either one of the worst liars I've ever seen or something's wrong with it.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.880]  And I mean that very serious.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:04.880]  That's my opinion.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.440]  I mean, I don't want to fight with the sheriff.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.680]  I'm not some type of police officer hater.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:12.080]  In fact, I respect the office of the sheriff.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.080]  It's elected.
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:16.360]  That's the most respectable constitutional law enforcement office there is.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.880]  And we have sheriffs across the country, from Milwaukee Sheriff to you name it.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.120]  We have the sheriff all the time.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.280]  I've had him on for 20 years that launched the sheriff movement to try to get liberty
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.920]  back, of course.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.560]  So it's very painful to see this and something's going on.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:39.880]  He's either trying to bait us or he's being manipulated by the Southern Primary Law Center
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.960]  or some other organization.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:47.560]  Let's play the clip that started all this last year of the sheriff's deputy saying it's
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.560]  for constitutionalists.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.560]  Here it is.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:55.800]  Well, a nice thing about this is that if somebody is directing fire toward a team that's trying
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:13:02.400]  to get in, they safely can, they can pull right up to the front and take enemy fire and
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.280]  still try to address the threat without being fear of getting shot.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:10.320]  So I'm thinking that it's totally appropriate in Iraq, but what kind of a situation in the
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.880]  U.S. would you see that happening?
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.040]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.040]  A lot of Indian.
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:29.040]  They have no weapons here locally.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.920]  Okay, and then he said the tape was edited, so we put out the entire 12-minute tape we
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.920]  got from the listener.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.440]  But again, we weren't even breaking this.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.560]  It was already out for a week.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.920]  We just wrote a story about it.
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.920]  Drudgereport.com picked it up.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:43.800]  Fox News picked it up.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:48.720]  And then we'll play later in the broadcast other sheriff's deputies at other departments
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:51.040]  saying the exact same thing with the exact same MRAPs.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:56.320]  I mean, it's chilling to have armored heavy vehicles, wheeled tanks that, you know, Joe
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:01.280]  fought in Iraq and Afghanistan in America.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:06.760]  And they tell us it's for us, the Democratic Party basically does.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:11.120]  And of course, a lot of these reps that are fighting back against this are veterans themselves
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.840]  and the sheriffs come out and call them traitors and run down their service.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.680]  Kind of like when you criticized Jade Helm, they kind of said, oh, he claims he was in
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:23.080]  the Army when they know you were in Rolling Stone, GQ and in Army times.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:26.240]  I mean, you were somebody they pushed in front of the cameras because you were in a heavy
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:27.240]  combat unit.
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.240]  Yeah.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.880]  And then they're like, oh, maybe, maybe you were in the military.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.480]  Maybe, you know, Matt Shea was in the military.
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.160]  Maybe these other people, it's really crazy how they try to deceive.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.320]  So Joe, what do you think's really going on here?
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.000]  And then we're going to go to Matt Shea.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.440]  This guy, this sheriff walks around blinders on it.
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.920]  And then the fact that he's using these YouTube comments as threats, we get death threats
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:46.920]  on YouTube.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:47.920]  Every day.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:48.920]  That's just what happens on YouTube.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:53.080]  I mean, I've got some of them right here that says, I hope your MRAP and your SWAT team
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.080]  takes you down.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.480]  And you know, this is something that they said that was on an in-force comment board
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.480]  that was in the Inlander article.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.080]  And then they said that we said this.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.080]  Yeah.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:06.800]  We know this is a major cover story that hundreds of thousands reads saying we're saying kill
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:07.800]  cops.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:11.840]  We're going to log on to YouTube, anybody can post anonymously and put some kind of comment
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.840]  up.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:13.840]  That has nothing to do with us.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.040]  No one at Infowars condoned that.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.320]  No one here wrote that.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.720]  So how does that have to do with us?
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:21.360]  Well, they're going along with the sheriff because first he said, we said it a year ago,
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.720]  and now they're running it saying that we're saying it.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.720]  Yeah.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:25.720]  They're saying that Infowars behind.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.200]  We could go on the Inlander and write that and say they said it.
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:33.280]  So all we're doing is trying to confront the fact that this guy is out of control completely.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.040]  The fact that he says he's going to use these MRAPs for constitutionalists.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.240]  What's wrong with being a constitutionalist?
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.000]  What's wrong with wanting to stand up for that?
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.920]  And then the fact that in like some places like in Washington, if you call 911, you have
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.800]  to say that you're a veteran not because they're going to approach you differently if they
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:48.800]  come to your home.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.240]  There's a huge problem going on.
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.320]  It's really crazy.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.600]  The people that have hijacked our government want to start a war with people in America
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:57.600]  that still are Americans.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.520]  I mean, it comes down to that.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:04.160]  If you're just a mainline, mom and apple pie, you want low taxes, right to defend yourself,
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.280]  your property, you're just a good, hardworking person.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.360]  You're the enemy because criminals have taken over and they're trying to manipulate police
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:14.960]  now into believing that we're the enemy to have a civil war.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:15.960]  That's my view.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.320]  We, of course, can give people the name of the sheriff, talk more about him, get some
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.320]  background on him.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:25.440]  But they've got mainstream media, national TV, you name it, really working with the sheriff
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:30.320]  to demonize the Liberty Movement that's growing in Washington state.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.240]  Representative Matt Shea, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.400]  Thanks for having me on again, Alex and Joe.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.400]  Good to see you again.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.400]  You too, sir.
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.160]  Tell us your view on all this and what you think is happening.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.760]  Well, so this sheriff is completely out of control.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.240]  In fact, I would use the word he's becoming unhinged.
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:49.520]  And this started several years ago when he brought the Southern Poverty Law Center here
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:52.520]  to Spokane, Washington to train sheriff deputies.
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:56.960]  I actually sat in on that training to see exactly what they were teaching.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.200]  I had my aide with me.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:01.520]  We took very copious notes and he put up on the screen there.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.160]  And by the way, this sheriff tries to claim that he didn't know what the training was
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.160]  going to be about.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.320]  And yet his picture was in the bottom right hand corner of the slideshow.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.800]  So he tries to claim he didn't know, but he knew exactly what was in this training.
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.360]  And during this training, they put the picture on the screen of the leader of the We The
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:21.160]  People Movement down in Pullman, Washington, Jeff Williams, put it up there.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:26.560]  And they said that he was a domestic terrorist or an example of one guy has never been tried,
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.560]  never been convicted.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:31.480]  In fact, I don't think he's ever even been investigated for that, and yet the Southern
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.800]  Poverty Law Center was demonizing this individual.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:38.640]  Now, it was brought to the sheriff's attention and instead of apologizing and saying, hey,
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:42.440]  I messed up, this shouldn't have happened, I'm sorry.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:47.160]  It took six months and several meetings of local area constituents and leaders to get
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:50.040]  that sheriff to send an apology letter to Jeff Williams.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.520]  And then years, a couple of years later, when this deputy finally says this out in the open
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:18:00.520]  on camera that the MRAPs are for constitutionalists, this sheriff, again, doesn't apologize.
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.960]  He just tries to say this was taken out of context.
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:08.640]  Alex, I don't know in what context that would ever be okay to say something like that.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:13.240]  And myself and many others that believe in freedom and liberty, that believe the Constitution
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:17.320]  means what it says, we're sick and tired of being demonized.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:21.520]  It's the people that are ignoring the Constitution in this country that are the problem.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:27.520]  It's the people like this sheriff, who, by the way, has been investigated for assault,
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:32.600]  for pumping public gas into a private vehicle.
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:37.400]  He's said publicly that he wants to stop all lying in his department and yet there was
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:44.520]  a murder of a pastor, a pastor literally on his own property here in Spokane, Washington.
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:49.280]  There was a $2 million settlement from that case because it was very clear that pastor
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:51.840]  was shot unlawfully.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.760]  That deputy continued on his department.
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:19:00.000]  And by the way, during the investigation, it was uncovered that deputy lied on his
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.880]  employment forms about outside employment, which was a sex toy shop.
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:08.720]  He was running with his wife, lied on that and was never fired for it and was only fired
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.720]  this year.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.400]  And he was in an unmarked vehicle, right?
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.400]  And he was in an unmarked vehicle.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:16.200]  I think they've got something planned big for this sheriff.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:21.440]  I don't know if they're trying to bait patriots in the area to try to have some incident,
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.320]  but clearly this is a key area.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:24.760]  That's why we're focusing in on it.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:28.680]  It's got a lot of patriots, a lot of constitutionalists, a lot of veterans, a lot of conservatives,
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:32.840]  one of the most awake areas in the entire Pacific Northwest.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:36.560]  And we have state representative Matt Shea here breaking this down with us.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:42.680]  I just want to know why he poses on the cover of major newspapers and magazines standing
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:48.520]  on the Gadsden flag and standing on basically the American people when that's one of the
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.680]  founding flags of this country.
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.440]  That flag predates the American flag.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.600]  That's one of the first battle flags.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.000]  It's the Marine Corps uses it.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  The Army has it.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.880]  I mean, this is just really arrogant and aggressive.
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:01.200]  And let's pull back.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.440]  This is a tiny window because most departments are smart enough to either reject the Southern
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.400]  Barbie Law Center ADL or they keep the training secret.
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.720]  We told everybody the MRAPS is for us.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:16.440]  Now we've got videos of departments all over the country or their manuals saying it's for
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:17.440]  us.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:18.600]  I'm going to repeat this.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:23.480]  Thousands of heavy armored vehicles with 50 cal machine guns, you name it, have been
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:31.720]  delivered free of charge or in some cases sold to departments for war with veterans
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:33.480]  and gun owners and conservatives.
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:34.880]  This is outrageous.
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:36.380]  It's criminal.
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:41.440]  It constitutes an attempted soft coup by the Obama administration.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:45.920]  And when people like Representative Shea and others have the will to go in the face of
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.880]  this tyranny, they get demonized.
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.680]  And let's talk about his demonization of you.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.480]  In fact, they gave me the report a few weeks ago.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.600]  Somebody reprint that newspaper and bring it to me.
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:55.920]  It's in a bunch of the newspapers.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.880]  This is a big paper there.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:58.880]  You read this stuff.
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:03.560]  You can't believe they're saying it or implying that we want to kill people or that you want
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:04.560]  to kill people.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.400]  And he says that you're out of control as a state rep.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.520]  He's really escalating the rhetoric when we've never said any of this.
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.120]  What do you think's really behind this?
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.920]  Because I really see the pieces and it doesn't look good.
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:19.280]  Well, I think there's two parts of it, Alex.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:26.120]  The first part is they're trying to bait liberty and constitutionalists, liberty movement folks
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.120]  are trying to bait us into doing something.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.120]  That's the very first thing.
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.840]  The second thing is they're trying to come after veterans.
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:36.320]  And in particular, this share of supporters tried to denigrate my service record.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:43.160]  And last year, and I served two combat tours overseas, Alex, in Bosnia and in Iraq, both.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:46.880]  And I got to tell you, I am furious.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:50.880]  This sheriff would try to say that I'm some sort of an extremist.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.960]  I'm some sort of a domestic terrorist.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:57.520]  When I sat there and I fought overseas, the very people that he should be more concerned
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.160]  about here in this country.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.160]  Oh, that's right.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.160]  I forgot.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:07.080]  The new article from last week, he now compares you to ISIS.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:10.440]  He actually says like the terrorist in ISIS.
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:11.680]  What's going on with that?
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:15.200]  Well, he says he compares us to ISIS.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.680]  He compares constitutionalist ISIS, then he tried to walk back and say that was taken
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:19.680]  out of context.
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:24.800]  Again, I would say there is never a context in which you say that word in the exact same
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:30.760]  sentence that acronym ISIS in the exact same sentence that you're implying that constitutionalists
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:31.880]  are domestic terrorists.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.480]  You don't say that.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:38.440]  And that's what's so alarming about the sheriff on top of the video that he did last year,
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:44.800]  October 20th, 2014, where he says, I can affect your freedom and take your life.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.680]  We need to be asking questions of the sheriff.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.680]  That's our job.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.280]  And this sheriff, instead of blaming victims and blaming other people, should answer for
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.280]  his actions.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:57.680]  And I have publicly asked that he resign and Alex, I'm here to ask you today, we need
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:02.520]  you up here in the infowars spotlight on this sheriff, because very clearly there is something
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.520]  going on in this area.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.680]  In fact, there's kind of a tale of two sheriffs going on.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:11.360]  We had the VA come up, Priest River, Idaho, and threatened the firearms rights of a veteran
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.320]  here a week and a half ago.
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:17.520]  And Sheriff Daryl Wheeler stood in the house with us and said, no bureaucrat is going to
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:23.400]  take away the God given an alienable rights of one of my citizens and one of my constituents.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:29.040]  Yeah, tell us about this hero sheriff that we should get on the show and interview versus
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:31.520]  this, this bizarro sheriff.
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:32.520]  Yeah.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:33.520]  Yeah.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:37.040]  So this, so Daryl Wheeler said, I think whatever sheriff should be saying that bureaucrats
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.600]  cannot take away any sort of God given an alienable right.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:41.600]  There's no judge.
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:42.600]  There's no jury.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:46.680]  They've even said they're going to use Obama announced a month ago, the VA model for the
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:52.320]  FBI now for regular citizens to just magically take your gun like a no fly list.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.840]  You don't know how you get on it.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.000]  They just come take your guns.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  Well, they have the VA sent in not letters like that to veterans all over the country.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.640]  Hey, sorry, we don't think that you're quite stable enough you're not able to handle your
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:03.640]  finances.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.400]  So the VA is going to come in and seize your weapons.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:11.000]  Now they're announcing all social security recipients to take automatic wire transfers.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:18.400]  This is the FBI announced this will be considered financially enabled to take care of themselves.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.600]  And basically will now be wards.
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:21.840]  The state, your guns will be taken.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:25.400]  Well, it's only going to be a matter of time before Sheriff Ozzie Nezevich brings in snopes
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:29.320]  to help solve crimes as well to help with the SPLC.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:35.320]  Joe, I can't believe that I just said on air that a month ago because you can pull it up
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:41.120]  mainstream news that they're now going to have the VA model go after people on social
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:45.760]  security saying that, you know, it's like they're next broken or something.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.760]  They can't have guns.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:50.560]  Well, they're next not broken just because you have a money transfer and do automatic
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.520]  wire transfer of your check that that means you can't take care of your finances.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:58.360]  And then the Congress came out in the Washington Times the next day on the Hill newspaper and
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:01.440]  said Congress warns Obama not to implement.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.440]  That isn't enough.
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.880]  He's going ahead with it.
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:06.480]  Representative Shea, can you believe it's moving this quick?
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:08.720]  I mean, this is really bold.
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:09.720]  It is very bold.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:15.880]  The last two months have seen just a massive escalation of what is very clearly a movement
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.200]  toward tyranny.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.200]  No question about it.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:22.760]  And up there in North Idaho, and this is what's going to happen across the country for all
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:26.520]  your viewers, all your listeners, this is what's going to happen across the country where
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:31.480]  they're going to have a doctor say, and they didn't say that he was mentally efficient
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.080]  or mentally incompetent.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:36.120]  They said that he was not competent to handle his VA benefits.
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:40.920]  That's what they said about this veteran and therefore under the Brady law that he could
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:46.360]  no longer own, possess, buy or sell a firearm.
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.880]  And it's very interesting.
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:53.360]  After we went up there, we stood on the front lawn when the VSO showed up there, we had
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.040]  the sheriff with us, and the VA completely backed down and began running away from this
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:01.520]  as fast as they possibly could the very next business day.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:06.920]  So the next Monday, the same doctor who had made that decision and had never followed
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:10.680]  up over eight months after this gentleman had a stroke to see that he'd actually recovered
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:16.280]  from the stroke, wrote a letter and said magically, oh, he's all better now.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.360]  He's totally fine.
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.520]  These are test trial balloons.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:21.760]  They have set it.
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.280]  They are coming after everybody.
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:29.520]  And I'm telling you, if they try to disarm millions of people on social security, it's
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.800]  going to start a civil war.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.400]  And I think that's their plan.
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.200]  So how do we not respond?
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.080]  Well, we don't get violent.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:41.000]  We politically get involved like this state rep and go and stand in the doors, draw attention
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.720]  to it, show video of it, and it will backfire.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:49.160]  I think that one of the great examples of this was just a video we posted here over
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:55.840]  the weekend, again, involving this sheriff's office and a particular deputy law horn, interesting
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:02.440]  name, by the way, where there was a pro-life protester on a corner, completely legal,
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:08.520]  four ladies come up and begin harassing him, hurling violent and vile insults at him right
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:09.760]  in his face.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:15.880]  A homeschool mom pulls over and begins filming, and it ends up that this guy, the guy that's
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:20.680]  protesting instead of the four ladies, is the one that is put in handcuffs and detained
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:23.680]  and treated abysmal.
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.120]  In fact, I saw that video.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.120]  Give us the name of that.
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:28.740]  We'll put it up on screen because this is what we're talking about.
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:31.360]  There are more patriots than there are pro-death people.
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:36.840]  The woman pulls over to document, then she's able to catch this sheriff's deputy following
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:43.320]  the Southern Poverty Law Center Soviet Roundup Plan to, oh, I've got one of these pro-lifers.
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.320]  Let's take them to jail, because they hate the fact that last weekend or the weekend
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:52.040]  before last, there were thousands of demonstrations across the country, some of them 500, some
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:56.720]  of them one person, some of them 1,000, some of them 20 people, but every person going
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:01.960]  out did something by drawing out the tyranny, by showing what these evil forces want to
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:02.960]  do.
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:06.200]  I mean, if that doesn't show how wicked this sheriff is, nothing does.
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:11.960]  Here it is, Spokane Sheriff's Deputy harasses peaceful pro-life protester, threatens witnesses
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.440]  on video.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:18.280]  This is what it is, to have a hardcore communist organization, that's what the Southern Poverty
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:23.360]  Law Center is, just hardcore evil running our sheriffs and police departments.
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.000]  I mean, this is sick.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  Representative Shea.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.560]  And the perfect example of how to act in this situation is what this whole homeschool
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.560]  mother did.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:36.920]  She remained calm, she remained very respectful, and she demanded that they state the reason
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.920]  she could not be there.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.560]  And this is despite the fact, and I want to read this for you, Alex, it's despite the
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:47.800]  fact that in the sheriff's own standards of conduct, it reads this.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:52.720]  The Spokane Sheriff's Office recognizes the right of persons to lawfully record members
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:55.920]  of this department who are performing their official duties.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:00.040]  Members of this department will not prohibit or intentionally interfere with such lawful
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040]  recordings.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.480]  They're not even abiding by their own standards, their own clear standards.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:10.120]  And this homeschool mom did a phenomenal job by remaining calm, standing on her God-given
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:15.200]  unalienable rights protected by the Constitution, and demanding that that deputy state the reason
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.400]  why she couldn't be there, and he didn't have an answer.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:18.400]  I'll tell you what's exciting.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:21.520]  I want to get Joe Biggs taking us when we come back and the state reps.
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:24.440]  You can feel the good people standing up in your gut.
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:28.640]  And they're so much stronger, so much more focused than these evil people, and evil
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:33.740]  knows it, that's why from Rutgers to the University of Texas, they're trying to restrict
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:37.080]  free speech, because they know they got to shut us up.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:40.800]  When we come back, we're going to fight back with the Second Amendment with Joe Biggs,
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.200]  Representative Matt Shea, VoteShea.com.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:48.400]  And this sheriff's trying to organize movements to have Shea removed from office.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.400]  We'll be back.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:50.840]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:30:00.360]  The Empires on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.560]  Kill Whites and Cops.
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:07.200]  Black Lives Matter-affiliated radio show calls for a race war.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:13.640]  In a disgusting audio broadcast via blog talk radio yesterday, an individual who admitted
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:19.480]  affiliation with the Black Lives Matter movement called for listeners to murder white people
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:24.120]  and police, declaring it open season for executions.
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:29.160]  Open season on killing whites and white police officers, and I want to talk about the shooting
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:32.080]  of the white deputy sheriff in Houston, Texas.
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:37.200]  It's open season on killing whites and white police officers, and probably killing cops,
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:38.200]  period.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.200]  It's open season picking them off.
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:43.600]  Today, we live in a time where the white man will be picked off, and it's nothing he
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:44.600]  can do about it.
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:45.600]  His day is up.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:46.600]  His time is up.
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:52.000]  We'll witness more executions and killing of white people and cops than we ever had before.

[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:28.840]  in having huge success, two next week because what she's doing is very important and we've
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:34.440]  got major GMO news where Germany is basically banning everything from the US, Russia is
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:41.360]  because it's so polluted, it's so dangerous and that's good it'll stop big agra from
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:45.960]  doing what they're doing, voting with our dollars.
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:51.440]  Here it is, Germany joins Scotland in seeking ban on gene modified seeds so that's all coming
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.760]  up.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:56.080]  We have Joe Salinta in the last 30 minutes but I want to be able to get into this Planned
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:02.440]  Parenthood situation, the Chinese stocks, what's happening in Europe, where I see all
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:03.440]  this going.
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:09.800]  I want to get into this clip where comedian Jab Sillary Clinton for attending Bilderberg
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:14.440]  on national TV, this is very exciting what's happening but I need to talk to Representative
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:19.800]  Shay and Joe Biggs for the rest of the hour to really be able to flesh all this out and
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:25.200]  I appreciate them joining us, we're going to go back to them in a moment because I tend
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:31.160]  to start talking real fast, I start sweating, I start getting angry, not because there's
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:38.000]  something wrong with me, if I was a German in 1938 Germany, believe me I'd be upset about
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.760]  what I saw, military equipment being deployed locally, people being demonized for their
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:48.200]  free speech, restrictions on gathering if you weren't in the right group, kids being
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:56.280]  told their parents weren't their bosses, classic totalitarianism and I got to say Hitler's
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:01.920]  tyranny early on was focused mainly on select groups, it wasn't general, the general level
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:09.080]  of bizarreness with public schools all over the country, banning touching hands, banning
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:14.520]  dodgeball, banning boy and girl, restricting free speech, schools all across the country
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:21.080]  are quote banning all flags, see all flags are hurtful now, all language is hurtful that's
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:26.400]  the goal where they can ban and restrict anything they want when they want, they're the arbiters
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:33.320]  who decide, these people are such tyrants that I get upset, I mean when they're deploying
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:39.040]  armored vehicles in every town and then police and military have told us for 18 years since
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:43.640]  I learned about this, from police and military, the chief of police of San Antonio, the head
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:49.440]  of emergency management in Kingsville, I have them on video saying Bill Clinton had dealt
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:57.200]  with force approach them about preparing martial law and gun confiscation and by exposing that
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.840]  they had to back off, they were thinking about pulling off more Oklahoma cities folks and
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:08.440]  blaming the liberty movement but we exposed them, we backed them off, now they're back
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:13.240]  and it's like 10 times worse than it was and they're openly saying and we have another
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:20.320]  clip from Indiana, we're going to play in a moment saying this is for the American people,
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:25.280]  this is for the veterans, they're going to attack us, that's a Morgan County Indiana
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:32.840]  police sergeant saying the same words that we know came out of the mouth of the sheriff's
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:39.560]  deputy in Spokane because it's southern poverty law center and in their public documents they
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:43.400]  say I'm evil and horrible and you know all this stuff but in their internal ones they
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:47.480]  say I'm a terrorist, we know that's come out, they were saying about locals that run main
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:51.840]  line tea party groups that this is a terrorist and imagine the sheriff's deputies are all
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:58.160]  sitting there in a room, hundreds of them learning in a major city, a major town that
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:04.520]  this guy is a terrorist, so they see a woman out with her first amendment, she's a terrorist
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:08.880]  I'm going to give the floor to Joe Biggs and Shay for the rest of this segment and the
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:12.920]  last segment of the show but I've laid that out, we're going to play this clip, briefly
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:18.400]  I want to just remind viewers it is essential that you spread the word about this broadcast,
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:23.200]  there is a reason they're attacking it, there is a reason they're demonizing it because
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:28.960]  we're here raising the alarm like Paul Revere, the exact same office Paul Revere had, we
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:36.360]  are in that position today, so is Matt Shay, so is people like Joe Biggs, so are you like
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:41.320]  that woman out there with the pro-life sign, they want to intimidate us not to do that,
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:44.760]  that's why they tell us not to, now most departments would support it because they're good people,
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:51.840]  we have to expose the bad people that are globalist collaborators by engaging them peacefully,
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:56.160]  they want to get it violent because we're winning the info war, no we've got hidden cameras
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:00.080]  inside your Planned Parenthood, we have hidden cameras inside your state houses, we're coming
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:06.080]  for you, we're stronger than you, there's more of us, we're awake now, we're coming,
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:10.400]  we're coming, go ahead and act however you want, we're coming for you, I'm glad you're
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:16.760]  scared, we're coming, go ahead, engage in some terrorism, blame us, this isn't 95, you're
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:20.720]  not going to get away with it, you didn't get away with 95, most people know that was
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.560]  an inside job now, go ahead, try to pull it because it's going to blow up in your face
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:29.760]  literally, before we go any further we have the best colloidal silver out there, Bar
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:36.680]  Nun, 30 parts per million, highest quality, I'm not going to sell out of it this time
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:40.800]  because we're not going to get more until mid-October at least, maybe November, so I'm
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:46.440]  going to try to hold back enough so at regular sales price we'll have enough to get us there,
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:50.800]  so I've done a calculation of selling it, how many we can sell until we need to stop
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:56.320]  the sale, Thursday or Friday we'll have to end it guaranteed, buy two bottles at regular
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:02.800]  price, get two bottles free or get 30% off the regular discounted price, it's an amazing
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:07.360]  deal, colloidal silver is so amazing, a lot of people know about it, read about it at
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:14.480]  infowarslife.com, continuing, supermail vitality, after being sold out for weeks for mail vitality

[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:50.360]  increased when hitting the gym, I also started noticing that my muscles don't hurt as bad
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:55.360]  as they used to after hitting the gym hard, my muscle recovery has improved tremendously,
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:01.240]  thank you infowars, all your products are amazing, 1776, okay, that's Miami, Florida,
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:06.120]  thank you for the review, thank you for your support, power lifter Dave, initially didn't
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:11.120]  experience much in the way of results so I held off writing a review, then a little
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:15.880]  over a week ago I began to notice some dramatic changes in how I felt and even in my mental
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:21.200]  state, this stuff is the real deal and it varies the dose, I withheld a star because
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:26.800]  I want to see the long-term effects when things normalize within my body, but I would and
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:31.600]  do recommend this to my friends, absolutely worth giving this a shot, yeah, what it does
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:37.960]  is block estrogen mimicry, it gets your glands to start releasing, it doesn't mimic a testosterone,
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.440]  it gets your body to release a whole bunch of stuff according to group, I don't know
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:47.000]  the technicals, read about it infowarslife.com and it helps find the operation, show it's
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.800]  a win-win, all right, I'm now going to try to settle down and shut up after this clip,
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:58.600]  here is again what we mentioned, the sheriff's deputy there in the county in Indiana, the
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:04.120]  full videos on infowars.com saying the exact same thing that the sheriff was saying out
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:05.800]  in Washington, here it is.
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:12.080]  We really didn't have the violence that we see today, the military is totally different
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:17.280]  now than it was in the beginning of my career, plus you have a lot of people that are coming
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:22.600]  out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.080]  law enforcement techniques.
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:28.200]  All right, Joe Biggs, you've been sitting back listening to all this, I want you to
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:33.040]  take a few minutes to break all this down, I mean veterans very low crime rate, conservatives
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:37.000]  were the lowest crime rates, there isn't an escalation in patriots engaging in criminal
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.840]  activity or terrorism, but they're trying to prepare us for when they false flag in
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:42.840]  my view, go ahead.
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:45.440]  I mean, just like that guy said, these guys are coming out of the military and they're
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:50.880]  automatically able to make these IEDs, which is complete and total BS, that only be a small
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:54.800]  portion of the people who actually train with explosive ordinance disposal or anything like
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:58.400]  that or just some random stuff that you can figure out on the internet yourself, but they
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:02.120]  make it seem like you come back from Iraq and Afghanistan and you have this capability
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:06.440]  to go out and build these complex bombs and go blow stuff up, when in actuality when you
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:12.680]  go over there you learn how to restrain yourself, you learn how to use just different types
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:17.600]  of how you carry your weapon, where you point your muzzle to safety with it, how you talk
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:21.640]  to people, how you approach, how you can de-escalate situations easier.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:26.600]  My ability to de-escalate a situation is much easier than it is for a normal civilian who
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:28.720]  hasn't quite been through what I've been through.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:32.440]  So when you see these sheriffs come out here and they say that we're just taking time bombs,
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:36.760]  that's kind of just out of control right there, I mean, that's way out there.
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:40.880]  Well, there are some that are taking time bombs, but statistically, veterans have lower
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.480]  crime rates than any other major group.
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:47.400]  Well, the ones that are taking time bombs are the ones that have been through a crazy
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:51.080]  scenario such as like a lone survival thing, they bring them back and they pump them full
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:54.200]  of medications, they don't get to the root of the problem, they pump them full of medications,
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:55.200]  they pump them full of medications.
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:57.640]  Or they had something wrong with them before they went.
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.880]  But that's what they need to do, they need to get to the root of the problem, stop demonizing
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.600]  an entire group of patriots who decided to get up off their butt and go fight for their
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:05.600]  country.
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:08.840]  Well, they're getting ready to get rid of humans in combat and have all machines.
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:11.120]  And the last group you'll have to deal with is going to be the veterans.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:13.720]  So there will be a major war on veterans worldwide.
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:18.240]  There's a war on men, there's a war on standing up, you know, Obama acts like he loves these
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:23.280]  soldiers that stood up on the train, they're all these heroes, that's exactly who they
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:24.280]  hate.
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:26.160]  But they're using the mainstream media right now to dumb everybody down.
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:29.960]  I go all over the country and I meet people, engage in conversations, a lot of people
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:31.800]  don't even know they have the right to carry weapons.
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:35.560]  They don't even know that they could carry an assault rifle or a shotgun or what they
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:39.080]  even need to do to have a concealed weapon.
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.080]  What do you think of this sheriff?
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:41.840]  What do you think he's doing?
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.400]  I think he's just spewing rhetoric.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:44.640]  I think he's out of control.
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:47.960]  I think this guy is a puppet for the SPLC.
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:51.880]  He's doing whatever he can to demonize the patriot movement in Spokane.
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:55.200]  Like you said before, that's a great town full of great people.
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:59.720]  I met over there, good head on their shoulders, freedom loving, liberty loving Americans who
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:03.880]  want to do the right thing, and they don't want to live in a government that's going
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:07.320]  to try to take their land or pull them over and unmark cars.
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:08.840]  They don't want to have to worry about stuff like that.
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:10.960]  They want to be normal American.
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:16.880]  And now he's on the cover of the newspaper, standing on the people, standing on the county.
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:17.880]  Yeah, that's-
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:18.880]  I mean, it's bizarre.
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:20.920]  They clearly are trying to get somebody to do something.
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:21.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:22.920]  He's definitely-
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:26.200]  He's been out there to talk to the sheriff, and he starts tweeting good.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.200]  It's about time.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.600]  And I'm like, man, this guy really, something's wrong with it.
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:32.160]  Yeah, and I told him, I said, hey, make sure you don't go on vacation this time, because
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.960]  last time we went out there, we showed up under the police department.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.640]  The guy was all of a sudden on this unexpected vacation that his department said had been
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:39.640]  playing for a while.
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:42.120]  But meanwhile, he'd been spotted all over town while we were there.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:44.120]  He was just ducking and dodging us.
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:46.760]  So we'll see if he actually stands up this time and comes out and talks.
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:49.560]  Well, we'd love to find out he was just wrong.
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:54.440]  But all right, I'm going to shut up now and go to Representative Matt Shea, voteShea.com.
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:57.800]  I notice in the news articles, they're saying, these are horrible state reps that are with
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:44:58.800]  these extremists.
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.240]  We need to vote them out.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:05.400]  And that's what the whole headline of the article says, that Spokane, Republican sheriff
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:12.440]  says members of his own party are dangerously dividing people when he's the one doing it.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:14.680]  Continue to break this down.
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:19.520]  So there are a couple of points here. First, I would like to also add that Sheriff Richard
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:22.880]  Mack challenged this sheriff to a debate.
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:26.160]  And this sheriff promised that at the beginning of the summer, he was going to have a debate
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:27.160]  with him.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:31.800]  And it's been eight months later, and he is still not followed up to debate Sheriff Richard
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:32.800]  Mack.
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:38.440]  So it's just a continued pattern of behavior by this guy to say one thing and then do something
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:39.960]  completely different.
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:43.360]  The other point that I would like to make as far as this is concerned, what we're really
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:46.760]  talking about when we talk about Planned Parenthood, we talk about this veteran that was being
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.680]  threatened, at least his firearms rights for being threatened up there in Precinct Ride
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:54.200]  Ho, they want us to self censor.
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:58.680]  They're trying to make the environment so toxic out there that we just self censor.
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:01.120]  And that is the worst kind of tyranny.
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:04.880]  And that's what really I think ultimately they are trying to do.
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:08.360]  This sheriff is directly related to FEMA.
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:09.680]  And boy, he's acting like it.
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:12.640]  Many of his statements are, oh, the government's doing a great job.
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:17.120]  Tell that to the people up in North Central Washington right now, where we had the Forest
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:22.720]  Service refuse to put a fire out when it was only an acre and it grew to thousands of acres
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:26.640]  and has destroyed dozens of cattle up there on one ranch in particular.
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:31.280]  So really there's this disconnect, I think, between these people that are defending the
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:33.840]  bureaucracy and the rest of America.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:40.120]  This sheriff says we need to vote these representatives out of office and yet because I stand on principle,
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:45.360]  because I expose this stuff and these other legislators that work with me over in Olympia
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:50.520]  expose this stuff and we fight it and we stand on that line, that's what the people want
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:54.680]  and we keep getting reelected by huge numbers no matter how much money they throw against
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:55.680]  us.
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:56.680]  That's right.
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:59.640]  You and others I was reading, you've had the Bloomberg anti-gun money coming into the
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:01.320]  state against you.
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:04.000]  You've got the Southern Parry Law Center sneaking around.
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.640]  You've got the media demonizing you, but all that does is make you more popular.
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:10.360]  What do you think that tells the sheriff?
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:13.440]  Well I think it scares the sheriff and that's what's making him so nervous, that's what's
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:17.160]  making him become unhinged like he is right now.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:22.400]  And when government is fearing the people, that's actually a good thing, is a good thing.
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:29.520]  That's what freedom is, that's what freedom looks like and I don't know going to some
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:33.480]  place over on the west side, downtown Seattle, if they're going to feel the same way I do
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:38.360]  about this, but many people in rural Washington and in eastern Washington do feel this way
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:44.280]  that bureaucrats are literally becoming little petty tyrants and that we're really experiencing
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:49.200]  bureaucratic terrorism and people are sick and tired of being guilty until proven innocent
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:53.480]  and the way that this sheriff's been acting, especially toward constitutionalists and especially
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:57.960]  calling them out on several occasions, is clearly fostering that feeling.
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:03.360]  And one recent incident and this has not been widely reported on, there was a gentleman
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:09.560]  who is very well versed on his constitutional obligations and is God given on animal rights
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:14.520]  protected by the constitution and he stood just like this homeschool mother did in this
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:20.080]  Planned Parenthood video and said, tell me why you are questioning us, are we free to
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:21.080]  leave?
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:22.080]  Are we being detained?
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:25.440]  Well he ended up getting arrested, he gets taken downtown, he's sitting there getting
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:29.840]  booked and one of the first things that's said to him is, you're one of those constitutionalists
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.280]  aren't you?
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:35.640]  And that's the attitude that is pervasive throughout this department, they try to say
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:39.720]  these things are taken out of context when in reality this is exactly what they're being
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:40.720]  trained on.
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:47.560]  It's incredibly creepy to see them doing this and it's all because of Agenda 21, it's
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:54.560]  all the new zoning, all the new regulations, it's preparing the police and the military
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:49:01.640]  for this tyrannical agenda and the agenda is admitted, it's in the news, they just
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:06.120]  don't want us speaking out against it because the agenda is so unpopular, I see the people
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:12.080]  across the political spectrum really starting to awaken Representative Shea, what would
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:17.200]  you say the sense is of your constituents about what's happening?
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:21.640]  The sense is exactly what you're saying that something is drastically wrong in this country
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:26.720]  that we are headed in the exact wrong direction, that tyranny is dramatically increasing especially
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:28.760]  over the last two months.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:33.840]  People before that said, oh that would never happen in America are now saying, oh my goodness,
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:36.760]  you were right, Info Wars was right, what do I do?
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:42.680]  So there is a great awakening happening right now and just that one incident up there in
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:47.600]  Priest River where the VA was threatening the firearms rights of that veteran, on one
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:53.400]  post we had 760 Facebook shares, literally went viral in a matter of hours and I think
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:57.320]  that is a testimony to the fact that people are waking up and not only waking up, they're
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:03.000]  ready to get engaged and stand on the line and say enough, no more, you've gone too far,
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.240]  you need to back up and get back in your constitutionally designed box.
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:09.880]  That's right, they're always trying to intimidate us, they're always trying to shut us up, they're
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:13.640]  always trying to make us think we don't have power but there's a time in history when people
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:18.200]  finally go across the line, they don't care what the enemy says or what's done or what's
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:22.160]  in front of them, they're going to find a way to expose it, they're engaged, they're
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:26.120]  motivated, nothing's going to stop them and I can feel that energy rising.
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:31.240]  I had dread just a few months ago seeing all this corruption expand but now I can see it
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.840]  and also feel it, just like in a football game you feel the momentum change when you're
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:40.160]  in the stands, I can feel the spirit of liberty exploding, can you feel it Joe?
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:45.440]  Of course, everywhere I go I can feel it, you see it when you talk to people, when people
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.480]  engage in conversation with you, you can tell that there's a great awakening happening and
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:50.480]  we're going to start winning.
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:54.320]  And they're not afraid, they know that they just got to get up off their butt, start speaking
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:58.080]  out and they don't care when or lose, they're not going to shut up.
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:00.560]  Final segment with our special guest.
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:04.880]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our US politicians
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:07.560]  argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.120]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:12.560]  Form your American body at infidelbodyarmor.com.
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:15.120]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:17.720]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:22.440]  Is it time to convert paper 41Ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:25.120]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:30.120]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:36.160]  So I found out the other day that at guns80.com a lot of people don't get the Ghost AR-15
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:40.960]  rifle kits because they're afraid that they won't be able to do the machining work required
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:43.320]  to drill out and make ready the lower.
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:48.360]  Well, listen, guys, gals, I am not that good of a machine as I promise you, but I was able
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:52.600]  to take a drill press with an X Y table and knock this out in about 45 minutes and in

[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.480]  to the next hour.
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:18.680]  Then we're going to get into the abortion situation and so much more.
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:24.760]  With this new video put together that illustrates reality and fiction together, how Red Dawn
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:28.800]  is beginning to parallel what America is becoming like.
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:32.040]  It's like a Red Dawn in slow motion.
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:36.080]  Darren McBreen and, of course, Rob Dew put this together last week.
[01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:39.960]  I thought I'd play it now and then get the representative's take on it.
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:45.520]  If you're a radio listener, it's even more powerful as video, so go to infowars.com forward
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:51.120]  and slash show, we're also going to post the video itself to YouTube today and post it
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:54.280]  to infowars.com in the next hour.
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:56.600]  But here is that Red Dawn parallel.
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:08.360]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America and this is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:09.360]  Dawn.
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:13.400]  Right now I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:19.560]  The chair is against the wall, the chair is against the wall, John has a long mustache,
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:24.760]  John has a long mustache, it's 12 o'clock American, another day closer to victory and
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:30.840]  for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:37.880]  But they took a lot of people away, people that they thought were going to make trouble
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:41.880]  for them, people that had guns and things they wanted, they just took them away.
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:42.880]  Where?
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:44.880]  We had education camps that they call it.
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:48.800]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:53.200]  to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:56:03.320]  I have decided we really need camps for adults and we need to have camps that you all run.
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:04.320]  I mean really.
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:07.560]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:12.160]  Now they were taken to race tracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:13.160]  assembly centers.
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:17.160]  I'm a solid citizen, I refuse to recognize you guys.
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:20.160]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:24.160]  I mean we've got a lot of Constitution lists and a lot of people that it's like foul weapons.
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:27.840]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:34.640]  and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:39.400]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:44.560]  to the United States, it's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:45.560]  community.
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:55.560]  It's what we're doing here and let's not kid about it, we're building a domestic
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:59.600]  army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:02.720]  Put your gun down really.
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:09.520]  Travelling Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, it's Alex Jones.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:14.640]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:20.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:32.680]  See that's my response is oh my God, like a foreign enemy is attacking.
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:36.520]  I see the manuals, the training, we got them first from secret sources as everybody knows
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:40.160]  seven years ago and they're preparing for war with us.
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:42.840]  Representative Shea, we've got a few minutes to break, we're going to come back and finish
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:47.320]  up but I mean isn't that the key to this that they don't want to have a debate about the
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:51.760]  treasonous, traitorous preparations that are being made that our own military doesn't
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:57.320]  want to follow and that's really what's backfired is the military is so awake now because they're
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:02.280]  trying to train them to take on their grandfather and their father who are a veteran.
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:05.840]  I mean this is really backfire, can you speak to that briefly?
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:10.560]  Absolutely the oath keepers in the military are alive and well, the spirit of 76 is alive
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:15.840]  and well and I would just comment on the one part of the video.
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:21.000]  We're disloyal to tyrants, we're disloyal to tyranny.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.560]  We are loyal to America, we're loyal to the Constitution and we believe the Constitution
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:31.560]  means what it says and what they try to do is deflect, obfuscate, devagle, get people
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:35.280]  pointed in every direction except what they're actually doing.
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:38.600]  Exactly because they are literally collaborators that have taken over the country, I mean they
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:41.440]  are an occupation force but that's not rhetoric folks.
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:46.400]  They're trying to ban the word boy and girl back in 70 seconds, represent the shape, finish
[01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:50.320]  up and then show.
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:54.920]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and

[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:55.600]  the fallen delayed due to the discovery of historical documents you can go to your listeners
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:02.080]  go to true legend the series legends plural the series dot com we found when Tim Alborino
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:07.920]  went to South America this is critical we found documents that have not been seen by
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:17.280]  anybody for 450 years talking about the supernatural nature of the sexual perversion of the Giants
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:21.840]  people that don't believe this you know I can't do anything about your unbelief but
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:31.560]  even Diodorus famous historian kind of an author 400 you know 500 years before Jesus bottom
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:38.120]  line is Alex the subject matter of supernatural evil and you just laid it out the Bohemian
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:42.040]  grove and all these people you know they're being promised now something they're being
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:48.200]  promised the same lie that Eve was told in the Garden of Eden you shall not surely die
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:53.360]  sure well that's when I mean that's the Nephilim I mean look at the movie Prometheus where it's
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:58.280]  Giants as well they're just throwing it in our face well listen my new book and this
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:04.800]  is really important Genesis 6 Giants first came out but I think 10 15 years ago I the
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:10.360]  whole thing has been redone 60 70% of it's new but what's fascinating who legends the
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:16.120]  series it's almost like we were given a time lock into the ancient past to validate and
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:22.560]  verify even stories that the Incas to Incas and the Mayans and the Aztec told that was
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:27.960]  kind of you know basically in their oral tradition and in their stele is that when
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:34.720]  the Giants went after each other to sodomize each other that literally lightning came down
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:41.080]  from heaven now what's the shot on that you know what's the chance of that 450 years ago
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:47.080]  how about this Conquistadors putting their sword in the eye socket of a giant and a
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:52.600]  Conquistadors sword can be 36 to 42 inches and barely touching the back of the skull
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:57.640]  people so that's just that's just me them making it up it's a universal thing so true
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:01.720]  legends of the series where we've got the first episode pretty much done as a matter
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:05.760]  of fact when I get off with you I'm going to film my last part and I think people's
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:10.480]  minds are going to be blown away because when you understand who's been covering up let
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:15.160]  me address one thing real quick how is it that the Pope is pushing for a one-rule
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:19.400]  government he's speaking against capitalism and yet in the same breath he's saying he
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:24.560]  believes in the devil and demons you know why he made that statement guess who are
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:31.040]  going to be made out to be the devil and demons anybody who resists the New World Order
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:37.680]  again true legends of series dot com my book Genesis 6 Giants is available on my website

[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:07.400]  with us let me tell you what the greatest irony is on this gun thing okay here we've
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:12.520]  got trained military people who have been trained on firearms but they won't let them
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:18.720]  go armed to protect themselves but the greatest irony is is that you'll find in my new book
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:24.720]  population control that the united states of america over the past couple of decades
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:31.040]  is the arms merchant of the world we provide seventy eight percent according to congressional
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:36.640]  records of all the arms sold to everybody around the world including of course the ices
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:43.080]  and the al-qaeda and all the rest of half the global half the global expenditures just
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:48.960]  on us yes so we provide seventy eight percent of all the arms into people in the world and
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:54.160]  then we look at russian china russia's five percent turn at china's three percent so
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:59.280]  we we saw more arms in russia and china combined all around the world and yet here in our own
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:04.880]  country they want to take guns away from everybody it's amazing aren't you a veteran yourself
[02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:12.400]  yes i was in the army during vietnam what do you make of the situation where we now
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:17.720]  know they've put 200 plus thousand veterans on don't treat list and just say go die we've
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:22.120]  known for a year and they just keep doing it it seems like i thought if we exposed evil
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:25.280]  a lot of times it would get turned around back in your day or even when i was on there twenty
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:31.640]  years ago now the evil comes out the iris persecutes people a thousand times times nixon literally
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:37.840]  and don't get in trouble well hey come on look at it alexa veterans are the most dangerous
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:44.760]  group to them because not only are veterans patriotic but veterans have weapons and know
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:49.520]  how to use them common sense you brought it up i don't want to bring up a story i'm in
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:53.120]  it just shows the insanity we can put it on screen if they have it yesterday right was
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:57.360]  two days ago salon that basically takes white house talking points and regurgitate some came
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:02.240]  out and said that the planned parenthood videos of hoax planned parent admits it's real and
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:06.200]  that i'm basically the bad guy that margaret singer was not a racist there it is conspiracy
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:11.160]  theorist of hijacked the gop what happens when trump cruise and carson start following
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:17.960]  alex jones lead and goes the planned parenthood hoax is a case study in how we're deceptive
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:26.640]  they admit this it's not a hoax you know that well we're into we're into a nostradamus
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:32.400]  the famous sixteenth century seer said that we're going to go in a time period when black
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:37.680]  is white and white is black up is down down is up and believe me that's that's where we
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:43.280]  are right peace is war well you've you've actually written a book that a lot of it was
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:47.200]  about margaret singer and the nazi influence in the u.s. right and we even have some slides
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:50.480]  in there some of it's in this book tell us about margaret singer since they say she
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:54.600]  was a loving person well yeah and i'm the racist you have to go back and understand
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:15:00.360]  about the eugenics this movement okay eugenics came up in the late eighteen hundreds and
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:04.680]  it was basically started right here in the united states in fact in california and was
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:09.720]  supported by some of the wealthiest biggest name people in country the herrimans the melons
[02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:17.720]  the rockefellas and and eugenics is basically let's have the perfect race you know if you
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:23.240]  had the wrong skin color or the wrong bone structure or your IQ wasn't up to their standards
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:31.280]  by the 1930s most every state had sterilization laws okay and you could be sterilized involuntarily
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:36.120]  but what happened was is that the germans got hold of that and said hey that's pretty
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:41.320]  good and the nazis took power and they carried it to its logical extreme which is well we
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:46.680]  have some people like jews and gypsies that we think might dirty the gene pool so they
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:51.680]  just said we'll just kill them and they had world war two and we had the holocaust and
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:55.000]  the people in the world went wait a minute you know we can't just go around killing
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:02.120]  people so today if you'll talk to these globalists they're all still very much eugenicists and
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:07.040]  they will say flat out in fact they have it as in stone in georgia at the georgia guide
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:13.160]  stone said turner he says we want to maintain the human population at 500 million that's
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:17.480]  a 90 plus percent reduction right which begs begs the question well wait a minute what's
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:22.200]  supposed to happen to the other seven billion of us and more importantly who's gonna decide
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:27.720]  who stays and who goes and how are they gonna get rid of us well the nazi show that they're
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:32.440]  running in trouble if they try to just shoot people and hang them and kill them so what
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:39.320]  they're doing is they are slowly thinning the human herd through bad food bad air bad
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:46.480]  water bad vaccines do you know the third leading cause of death in america today after heart
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:52.760]  attacks and cancer is conventional medical treatment i didn't know that i want to get
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:57.800]  into your book it's simply amazing and it's solution based to understand what to avoid
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:03.080]  is along the line that i'm focusing on exposing the breakaway civilization is poisoning us
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:08.240]  so that they can basically just phase us out and they can and profit from it and profit
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:11.760]  while they do it that's the genius of these people they're not dumb and it's kind of an
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:15.000]  argument if we put up with it maybe we deserve it but i wanted to ask you a selfless question
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:20.160]  because i grew up hearing how great texas was and how we were the smartest the toughest
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:24.040]  the most honorable blah blah blah lord knows a lot of bad comes out of texas too but now
[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:30.440]  that i've studied history traveled the world i do know that texas is certainly exceptional
[02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:34.200]  the military has always tried to recruit as much as it can out of texas saying they found
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:40.200]  in combat and operations texas on average you make the best soldiers and then it's i
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:44.520]  notice it's texas so much that are resisting the new world order but it was texas that
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:49.640]  also killed kennedy who also do really nasty stuff so dark side and light side texas seems
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:55.320]  to be a real crossroads and now texas is opposing so much of the new world order you're a classic
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:18:00.600]  texan go way back you're a texas you know just standard great texas guy what do you
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:06.240]  think about texas before we go to break well texas is it i'm like you alex i've traveled
[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:10.640]  the world i've been to to bet i've been to the middle east i've been to europe i've
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:15.760]  been to canada i've been all over and there's some prettier places there's some very picturesque
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:22.000]  places but i've never found a place in the world that i think measures up to texas texas
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:27.840]  we've got it all and uh we we've got beaches we got mountains we got forests we got planes
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:32.600]  we got the people too because we go back to texas history and we have people yes and you
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:37.560]  go back to the people who broke away from mexico and i'm not talking about the white
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:42.480]  settlers i'm talking about ones again and the hispanic people that lived here and i know
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:47.720]  i don't know at least in my life growing up in texas uh everybody got along everything's
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:53.480]  good and you mentioned some of the bad stuff that came like kennedy okay uh let me tell
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:57.760]  you something some of some of those people involved in some of the bad stuff were not
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:02.280]  even truly texans one of the things that's really griped me for years the fact that the
[02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:07.760]  bush family uh they say well they're from texas well they're texas oil men no no no they came
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:14.480]  from connecticut they're just yankee carpetbaggers and you're right texas has always had a military
[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:20.040]  history that we should be proud of uh i know during the late great war between the states
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:24.200]  it was robert e lee one of the most famous generals in the world he said when the going
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:30.560]  gets tough i call them my texas and i unfortunately you know today we've all gotten fat and soft
[02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:35.280]  and and easy but i think it's time to buckle down and pay attention well i mean just look
[02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:39.440]  how much texas is giving the globalist resistance yeah and then look at how the feds are cutting
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:43.680]  off of the funding everything that comes from our money anyways but we're creating a gold
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:49.360]  billion repository texas just took his gold back i'm telling you texas is special we're

[02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:20.400]  Jim Mars is our guest for the next segment I'm going to ask him what the globalist in
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:24.480]  game is and does he agree that he's got a weird feeling like everybody else does and
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:28.280]  that things are coming to a head but I haven't read your book yet I've scanned over it it
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:33.880]  looks like a page turner I'm going to read it on the airplane over to Spain next week
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:39.840]  but population control how corporate owners are killing us Jim Mars best-selling author
[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:44.520]  this is short segment long segment coming up what do you want to tackle first about the
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:49.520]  premeditated plan to kill us and make money off doing it well I think the key thing here
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:55.440]  is you've got to understand and I use quotes from many people and I've charted their activities
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:58.960]  we've got a short segment here so I'll just put it in a nutshell take your time as we
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:05.120]  can go to the next this is all this ties into everything issue that you deal with Alex and
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:11.320]  all the people who follow you this has gone beyond politics this has gone beyond philosophy
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:20.080]  or debate this is self-defense these people want you dead and they're working at it and
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:25.640]  if you care anything about safety and well-being of your family your loved ones you better read
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:30.480]  my book you better study better listen to Alex and you better find out what they're doing
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:35.040]  to you so that you can have a countermeasure so you've researched it deeply and that's
[02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:39.440]  I mean they're just open it's like Bayer knowingly putting HIV for 10 years and hemophilia
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:43.440]  X blood product and then it came out they knew it and liked it well let me quote from
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:48.880]  Prince Philip a leading globalist okay the head of the Windsor's over there in England
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:56.240]  he says if I'm reincarnated I would like to come back as a deadly virus to help solve
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:26:01.400]  the overpopulation problem that's right in other words he wants to kill us now how about
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:08.440]  he goes first yeah that's what I say let him take the first step but it and but here's
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:14.080]  the whole thing it's all based on the phony premise all these globalists Bill Gates you
[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:18.360]  know Warren Buffett ten-turn watermelon you listen to any of them they'll tell you that
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:23.840]  the overriding problem in the world today is overpopulation too many people okay now
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:27.640]  if you live in a big city and you have to put up with the noise the traffic pollution
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:32.560]  it's pretty easy to fall into that yeah there's just too many people using up all the resources
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:38.960]  but if you look at it coolly and logically and let's look right now today in Hong Kong
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:45.440]  the average living space is 1700 square feet hey if you had an apartment 1700 square feet
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:50.240]  that's pretty decent size it's bigger than most of the apartments I lived in and based
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:56.920]  on 1700 square feet the entire 7.5 billion population in the world could live comfortably
[02:26:56.920 --> 02:27:03.200]  enough just in the state of Texas that's true and I've seen those statistics but the
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:07.920]  West is dying and has a problem we're having 1.3 children on average for two adults you
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:12.320]  gotta have 2.1 to even replace and take care of the folks or economies collapse we know
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:16.880]  this the third world is growing fast they have dirty technologies it is causing some
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:21.160]  problems but they're suppressing as you know you've written books on it a lot of advanced
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:24.760]  technologies that would have taken us out of this right none the none the least of which
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:31.520]  would be to pursue and move on into space as we heard about when we were kids plus humans
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:35.440]  need a goal yeah we're go the moon we're gonna have mine minerals it'll pay for the space
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:39.880]  problem we're go have colonies on Mars and we keep going but then you'd have to be a
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:45.600]  fan of humanity and not write us off that's right and and it's hard enough to control
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:51.480]  this world it must less if you go into others you wanted to get into glyphosate you see
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:56.320]  I said what's the most important thing in your book and you said glyphosates glyphosate
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:02.160]  even even the world health organization now has admitted that glyphosate is a carcinogenic
[02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:08.360]  it can cause cancer but what I'd like to point out is that they've showed that the rise of
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:15.240]  glyphosate use which is the major ingredient of Roundup which is the Monsanto herbicide
[02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:22.840]  which they are putting now on all of our important food crops soy corn wheat and you can draw
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:30.360]  a parallel rise between the rise of the use of glyphosate and the rise of autism in children
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:36.520]  which is just gone out you know that's shocking I'm no chemist but you mean lots of weed
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:40.920]  poison hundreds of billions of tons being used a year 400 billion tons a year now being
[02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:46.600]  used in every water table weed weed killer might not be good for our brains well gee
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:52.720]  poison and you know it's whoa that's a conspiracy theory but now I tell you weren't something
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:29:00.520]  shocking Dr. Stephanie send it a MIT research scientist who says that there is a definite
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:05.600]  link between glyphosate and autism definitely the crap snakes you know yeah and she says
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:13.560]  that about 2025 that's just 10 years from now she said at current rates every other child
[02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:18.840]  will be autistic well I think that's that's a good I mean thank you new world order yeah
[02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:23.280]  well and from their standpoint that's pretty good because hey it'd be easy my lord that's
[02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:28.760]  only 10 years away I know and then half the new kids will be retarded yep and they're
[02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:32.240]  like oh don't use the word retarded but it's okay to kill him it's okay to brain damage
[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:36.080]  him just use the political correct term okay let me be correct they're going to be seriously
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:42.000]  mentally disabled right now can we talk about but it's okay I mean it's okay because they'll
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:49.640]  vote Democrat oh boy you're something else Jim Mars is our guest stay with us we're on

[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:25.880]  to host the show i told everybody that for about six years in the show twenty it's been
[02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:30.120]  syndicated for eighteen and a half but for about eighteen plus years i've been on from
[02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:35.600]  eleven a.m. to two p.m. and for about five years six years about five and a half years
[02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:39.120]  i did a fourth hour but when i started doing the nightly news and getting a lot of crew
[02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:43.520]  members under me and have a lot of administrative stuff and research stuff i shifted stopped
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:46.600]  doing the fourth hour because it was just killing me i mean i literally had to go take
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:51.320]  a nap for like an hour afterwards three hours kills me too i think it's the bright lights
[02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:54.840]  or whatever when i do it the show at home every once in a while it's dark i just feel
[02:33:54.840 --> 02:33:59.120]  great when i go forever it is calm i'm actually thinking about sometimes just doing the show
[02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:03.120]  from home and having anchors in here that are covering news just because people say
[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:06.720]  that sometimes when it's not even video they say man shows even better when it's just old
[02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:10.960]  fashion radio maybe a day a week or something i'm gonna start doing that in the future but
[02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:19.320]  long story short absolutely but long story short jim mars is going to be hosting thirty
[02:34:19.320 --> 02:34:24.320]  minutes of the next hour by himself in here he's a great guy smart guy he knew the whole
[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:28.480]  fourth hour if he wants because a lot of stations want that fourth hour we are going
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:33.080]  to start having it be a guest host hour i'll host a lot of times as well we'll have round
[02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:38.320]  table discussions it'll be a news hour it'll be really something special every day that
[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:42.000]  fourth hour we're bringing it back and some stations never turned it off when i quit doing
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:46.280]  four hours two years ago a lot of stations still carry it so jim mars will be doing
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:51.440]  as much of the as much of the fourth hour as he wants i predict you won't do the whole
[02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:56.600]  thing cupcake so so so that's coming up and if you want give the number out and take calls
[02:34:56.600 --> 02:35:03.280]  but yeah before i do that we have to sell fund here and i simply go out and whatever
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:08.640]  i use what i like what i think is neat is what i end up trying to go out to the distributor
[02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:14.880]  to the manufacturer and get g-shock watches are the original tough watches so they're
[02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:18.880]  the most state-of-the-art and the most up-bitted today military users and everybody knows
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:24.000]  that and they're also very very affordable compared to other watches that don't even

[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:36.240]  coming i can't even do it i don't know i think i lost my scottish accent uh you you look
[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:42.200]  like a scottish guy though yeah it's true did you hear where there's a famous pub in
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:48.000]  scotland and the managers announced they have a new policy that they're making the uh waiters
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:54.080]  wear pants because this is true really because too many women were coming in and trying to
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:40:01.360]  pull up their kilts to see what they were wearing and uh they said at first it was funny he said
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:05.640]  i hear women go after this scottish guilt yeah that's right there's nothing feminine
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:12.200]  about it i mean it's it's comfortable manly kilts absolutely and then i could i could
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:18.160]  wear a kilt and then be on tv and get a courage award like katlyn jenner at espn that's right
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:25.400]  hey you could declare because you feel like it that you're a third gender wait a minute
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:28.640]  i'm gonna go to you a minute can we pull up that i've announced i've come out of the closet
[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:35.160]  can you guys pull it up other videos alex shunz comes out of the closet um i i've come
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:41.280]  out of the closet but but not that i'm a woman or not that i'm gay but that not that i'm
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:45.560]  a space alien or a blood drinking lizard from the planet pop tart no i've come out do we
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:51.600]  have the video ready yeah yeah we're gonna pull it up i mean it's in the system i know
[02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:56.280]  i just sprung it on you uh the videos on info wars dot com alex jones has now come
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:41:00.400]  out of the closet while they're finding out what do you think this obsession with this
[02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:04.880]  stuff is is it about diverting from the fact that we're all losing our basic rights so
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:11.360]  the new writers that women can be standing up i don't know i said to me it's uh uh proof
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:17.480]  of the uh psychological problem that they've noticed with rats you know uh you put a few
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:22.640]  rats in a cage they get along just fine you put too many rats in a cage they start going
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:27.480]  nuts and they turn on each other and i think maybe that's it there's too many people crammed
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:31.240]  together and and so people don't feel like they have a future they don't feel like they
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:35.800]  can be creative used to you wanted to explore you want to invent you want to build you want
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:40.200]  to have art now it's i'm gonna have green arm hair that shows that i'm mad at men i'm
[02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:44.240]  gonna be standing up and i'm not joking they have serious shows going women are being standing
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:49.760]  up this is the true feminism and it's just like what it's like it's just stupid well
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:53.200]  i don't care like bruce i mean i'm gonna freak out of a walk in the men's bathroom and that's
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:59.040]  going on bruce dinner can call himself anything he wants to but when it comes down to biologically
[02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:04.440]  he's a man and i'm did you see what they said on uh seeing in the that one of the co-host
[02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:08.800]  said i'll put you in a hospital if you say that again mm-hmm oh yeah yeah there that's
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:15.480]  uh that's tolerance that's the left the leftist in the the crazies they they practice tolerance
[02:42:15.480 --> 02:42:18.840]  and if you don't want tolerance they'll beat the crap out of you and put you in the hospital
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:22.680]  and you know i would think of you as a classical liberal you're for drug decriminalization you're
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:27.560]  for alternative energy i mean liberals you know really you really like you but you're
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:32.000]  not a fascist i mean you're not wanting to arrest me it's not that we care if some guy
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:37.160]  wants to be a woman i don't want to pay for it no i i not differ with you i i've never
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:41.240]  thought of myself as a liberal i think of myself more as a conservative but what i meant
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:45.280]  like a classical liberal like thomas jefferson well that's it it's like if you're conservative
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:51.160]  what is it that you want to conserve uh too many uh so-called conservatives today particularly
[02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:56.440]  the rhinos you know they want to conserve the status quo and that's not me what i want
[02:42:56.440 --> 02:43:01.960]  to conserve is the constitution the bill of rights and the idea of freedom private property
[02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:07.400]  do what you want property and equality you know i you know doing the when the civil rights
[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:11.840]  thing came around and i stopped and thought about it and i was a good old redneck southern
[02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:16.200]  texas boy but i thought you know they got a point why should somebody be discriminated
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:20.120]  against because of the color of their skin i said i'm backing off i'm gonna you know
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:24.840]  i'm not gonna i'm gonna help them out of whatever let's all just be equal but you know it's
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:31.920]  it's not even equal anymore now now it's reverse racism and people just don't get it because
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:38.520]  you know i think everybody if i say i'm gonna vote for this person because he's black okay
[02:43:38.520 --> 02:43:43.560]  well you know that's just as much racism as to say i'm gonna vote against i would vote
[02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:47.720]  for a black ron paul and it would even think what color they were right i could literally
[02:43:47.720 --> 02:43:51.200]  kill a woman but they're gonna make if we don't want hillary that we're against women
[02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:55.960]  well no no no see i that same way i i have no problem at all with the woman in the white
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:44:00.920]  house i just not hillary because i don't think she qualifies well yeah because she probably
[02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:07.920]  actually is a man in drug she's the reverse of jenner well no actually she is jenner
[02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:12.160]  is there generally speak i'm being sarcastic you know that you know they actually say that
[02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:17.280]  michelle is a is a trainee yeah i heard that and i snickered that one off until i really
[02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:23.160]  looked at it seriously and she's got i think there's some question there you don't think
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:28.440]  that's like a cigar she's hiding her pants well it could be it could be she might just
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:37.720]  have saggy panties i don't know i don't want to go there i mean i'm still having trouble
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:43.280]  enough trying to tell people uh explain the problem of two planes knocking down three
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:49.840]  building maybe when they held chopo jenner it shot off like a missile and blew up building
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:55.040]  seven yeah i mean i mean that makes as much sense okay i'm gonna stop right there it's
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:45:00.120]  a family show but this is what's in the news how do you not talk about it yeah i mean if
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:04.720]  they're just force feeding all this garbage we do have the video so this is my coming
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:12.880]  out i have become a dog a a a bloodhound i am trans species and if you don't agree with
[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:17.560]  it then you're a racist here it is but if you love your dog you know katelyn jenner
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:22.120]  is actually the real el chopo the problem is he hasn't actually done the chopping so
[02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:27.080]  i say he's a fraud with me i've gone and i've had surgery and i've had these prosthesis
[02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:34.680]  ears added i am now choosing to be trans zoological i believe is the term i may just have to be
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:38.520]  trans abled and shot my arms and legs off and i'd be known as a biscuit and limit a box
[02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:42.360]  we're taking care of and if you don't accept it you're hateful in fact if you don't adopt
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:49.080]  my lifestyle and wear dirty brown socks on your ears after you work out you're a racist
[02:45:49.080 --> 02:45:54.680]  you're a homophobe you're an anti zoological fob you're a piece of filth so now i become
[02:45:54.680 --> 02:46:04.360]  my new self that's real i actually you know i saw the latest conspiracy i think i sent
[02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:08.640]  it to nico because what it's sad but all these schizophrenics and mentally ill people that
[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:13.040]  are now online they have a voice which is good everybody has a voice now but now they don't
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:19.520]  just think i'm bill hicks they think rush limbaugh is wait for it jim morris oh my god
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:25.080]  i mean that one is even better that was a good one alex uh i've got a fire hydrant out there
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:33.480]  i want to introduce you to oh yeah you'll love it love it first you know actually since
[02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:38.960]  i put those ears on i have been peeing on fire and it's my right to do it that's right
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:45.000]  it's my right i deserve a courage award there it is rush limbaugh aka jim morris and was
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:51.960]  bill hicks aka alex jones influence to get on radio so that's how it's all connected
[02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:58.400]  i mean look at this and this is not sat down these people actually back it up back it up
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:09.680]  they actually on this video show side by side it's a rush limbaugh jim morris they're so
[02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:15.800]  crazy how silly can you be i mean everybody knows you're actually carl rove oh man david
[02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:20.360]  mentelson listen i i did this video i said i was really a british thespian is a joke people
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:25.880]  think it's real now they're searching david mentelson that's the thing they won't admit
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:31.080]  that glyphosate is connected to brain damage and that one half of the kids in the country
[02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:37.200]  in 2025 are going to be brain damaged that's admitted in this epic the government admits
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:41.200]  florida's brain damaging us now right but no one will talk or they admit chemtrails
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:44.640]  are real no one will cover the real documents they just want to speculate and then that's
[02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:47.680]  how the media tries to discredit us you know i'm just trying to cover up i'm really i'm
[02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:52.000]  actually jim morris and i'm insulted i mean i like bill hicks at some levels but i think
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:58.320]  jim morris and as a musician was more interesting so actually i am jim morris and were you being
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:05.920]  accused of it can as well go for it uh oh they're already connecting me says our jim
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:10.760]  jim will be spawns of satan together because we're talking about us actually are you really
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:17.920]  jim morris and you have to start with your hair all right i'm going to stop start getting
[02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:22.200]  into your book get into the more serious areas and then you know a lot of people have a beer
[02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:25.200]  together that's a lot of fun that's right then we look up at seven hours this past hey
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:29.840]  that would be your fourth hour right there you just moved to a local pub and and sit
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:35.720]  around have a few beers and then uh just talk honestly please don't give me that idea that's
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:39.120]  actually we've actually had that idea but i've pretty much quit drinking to lose weight
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:46.080]  uh and uh so you know i only drink after six now uh and of course it's always six somewhere
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:49.640]  on the planet well maybe i'm being sarcastic i'm not a heavy drinker if you're drinking
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:55.760]  six maybe you ought to cut it down to two i mean i'd only drink at six i i get it cut
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:49:01.080]  from six i only have two at two and three at three and four at four and five at five
[02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:09.080]  and six at six and well hey take me i don't drink anymore or any less pretty much no we'll
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:12.840]  go have Mexican food and have a dosekies or two there you go i mean let's be honest we're
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:19.040]  not that cool that's true that's true um anyways i apologize jim mars you're here with your

[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:42.640]  saying when you started doing this 50 years ago you've been around that long you may actually
[02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:53.480]  be the real Gandalf no I'm Santa no I'm not actually that old but it's true when I started
[02:56:53.480 --> 02:56:58.000]  off and I'd be on radio shows or whatever and I'd try to tell people you know there's
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:02.600]  a clique of people trying to run the world and they're meeting secret societies and they're
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:06.760]  trying to set the agenda and they're trying to run everything and I'd get these calls
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:11.280]  coming in saying how do you let this guy on the air you know this guy's a nut you know
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:17.160]  this guy's a conspiracy theorist this guy's a buff this guy's an idiot you know what the
[02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:22.800]  last 10 years or so I don't get those calls anymore I'm sure those people may still be
[02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:28.280]  out there but they're keeping them to themselves you know he classified in congressional hearings
[02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:33.360]  many years ago that the CIA on the 60 started using that term the Clintons in their first
[02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:37.080]  presidential run it's been released by their library that they said anyone criticizing
[02:57:37.080 --> 02:57:47.440]  them call them a conspiracy theorist oh exactly no no it goes back to 1954 no no 1967 I believe
[02:57:47.440 --> 02:57:53.680]  after the Kennedy assassination and there was a document filed by the CIA's division
[02:57:53.680 --> 02:57:58.480]  of intelligence and went to all their bases and all their assets and if you know anything
[02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:03.200]  about Malkinburg media it went to the media and it said anybody that's questioning the
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:08.160]  basically anybody questions the government you call them a conspiracy theorist and that's
[02:58:08.160 --> 02:58:13.920]  why it's interesting I have a 1940 dictionary and you go look up conspiracy and it says
[02:58:13.920 --> 02:58:19.240]  a plan that's all it was so if we ever talk about bad people having plans in government
[02:58:19.240 --> 02:58:24.760]  or corporations it doesn't exist well everybody knows it does of course our legal system puts
[02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:35.440]  people in jail every year have convicted of conspiracy this is GCN the Genesis Communications

[02:59:54.400 --> 03:00:13.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[03:00:13.880 --> 03:00:36.520]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones there are different
[03:00:36.520 --> 03:00:44.920]  philosophies to govern populations of humans that's unspeutable and we've seen the last
[03:00:44.920 --> 03:00:51.720]  century communism sold as the rebellion against capitalism when we should see a rebellion
[03:00:51.720 --> 03:01:01.800]  of capitalism against insider mafia rule known as crony capitalism but if you look
[03:01:01.800 --> 03:01:09.840]  at a country like Mexico that has depending on which resource you look at about three
[03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:18.880]  times the natural resource on average that the United States does but why can't Mexico
[03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:26.280]  ever seem to become wealthy or free well they never got out from under colonialism you can
[03:01:26.280 --> 03:01:36.440]  argue we never did a hundred percent either and folks in Mexico are really smart and innovative
[03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:43.720]  but using Mexico as an allegory or an analogy or a parallel I went and saw a movie Saturday
[03:01:43.720 --> 03:01:48.360]  night that everyone should go see that I want to get the director of on and it was cartel
[03:01:48.360 --> 03:01:59.800]  land and it shot about 80% of it inside Mexico about 20% on the Arizona border and it shows
[03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:07.960]  the Mexican militias that have taken part taken back large parts of the country but
[03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:16.440]  then only themselves to become a mafia again and they all say well if we don't do it somebody
[03:02:16.440 --> 03:02:24.600]  else will do it and then they lock up the founder of the movement and put him I'm giving
[03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:29.320]  the movie away here put him in federal prison at the end because he won't go along with
[03:02:29.320 --> 03:02:38.200]  it it was the winner best documentary Sundance Film Festival it's that good and what's crazy
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:43.680]  is it's actually fair it just shows the humanity of both sides it actually puts the minute
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:53.920]  men it's not the minute men group itself a similar vigilante group
[03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:59.840]  on the same level as the Mexican vigilantes doesn't say they're perfect they're just human
[03:02:59.840 --> 03:03:04.680]  but it shows the police cooking the methamphetamine it shows all the different gangs and that's
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:13.400]  all it is is rival gangs in the Mexican economy they have different rival gangs bidding with
[03:03:13.400 --> 03:03:17.880]  each other to try to get other people to join the other gang they have an economy based
[03:03:17.880 --> 03:03:25.120]  on the dark ages Mexico is back in the dark ages now because everything becomes how big
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:33.480]  is your gang and you've got the central government the army the Marines with the Marines build
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:41.360]  is the non corrupt group that's not true though they're not as bad as the army who basically
[03:03:41.360 --> 03:03:47.120]  go and shut down the militias then reconstitute them with their operatives inside who are
[03:03:47.120 --> 03:03:52.560]  actually narcotics traffickers and they don't say it in the movie but it's clear the government
[03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:57.240]  of Mexico and the United States are the ones organizing all this and it's come out in court
[03:03:57.240 --> 03:04:06.680]  so I don't know why they didn't put it in the movie that El Chapo and is number two
[03:04:06.680 --> 03:04:12.960]  guy and all of them when they're in court with his number two guy this is even in the
[03:04:12.960 --> 03:04:19.000]  El Paso time Chicago Tribune three years ago we're working for the CIA DEA and FBI running
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:26.480]  all the major drug operations and had been armed to take out the specific cartels not
[03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:32.880]  controlled by the Federal Reserve and I had a former DEA agent on Celica Steel that they
[03:04:32.880 --> 03:04:40.880]  went and set up and raided his house put in jail after he came on when he said they tried
[03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:49.120]  to hire him as he was a Vietnam vet to train Los Zetas and other cartels working for the
[03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:56.560]  CIA for El Chapo before this was ever in the news before the war in Mexico started eight
[03:04:56.560 --> 03:05:04.280]  years ago police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool
[03:05:04.280 --> 03:05:10.840]  called stingrays which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages
[03:05:10.840 --> 03:05:18.080]  without warrants the technology comes courtesy of the FBI who have forced our nation's police
[03:05:18.080 --> 03:05:24.280]  departments into signing nondisclosure agreements forbidding them from publicly talking about
[03:05:24.280 --> 03:05:29.720]  the technology needless to say this is a direct violation of our fourth amendment and they
[03:05:29.720 --> 03:05:35.800]  have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying where we now know that police are collecting
[03:05:35.800 --> 03:05:42.240]  information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes once
[03:05:42.240 --> 03:05:48.200]  again more evidence that the police state isn't coming it's already here this is Darren McBreen

[03:07:58.360 --> 03:08:08.440]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[03:08:08.440 --> 03:08:15.760]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network the intro your hearing is aired for 18 years
[03:08:15.760 --> 03:08:24.360]  i've been syndicated for 18 years on air for 20 soon to be 21 about four or five months
[03:08:24.360 --> 03:08:32.120]  hard to believe 21 years on air soon and i meant it tongue in cheek then you know broadcasting
[03:08:32.120 --> 03:08:37.000]  from deep behind enemy lines because originally there was another little intro before that
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:42.960]  that was clips from red dawn where the chair is against the wall chair is against the wall
[03:08:42.960 --> 03:08:50.280]  john has a long mustache you know coded messages from unoccupied us into the occupied us and
[03:08:50.280 --> 03:08:55.160]  for all of you on or behind enemy lines this song's for you and then it would cut from
[03:08:55.160 --> 03:09:05.400]  that into that intro but now 18 years later almost 19 years later we're under fema the
[03:09:05.400 --> 03:09:11.200]  nsa does whatever it wants the cih5 is on congress obama rules by executive fiat we're
[03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:15.480]  going under tpp that no one's even allowed to read the three subsections that have been
[03:09:15.480 --> 03:09:22.440]  leaked by wiki leaks are just so draconian across the board and they've got the ford
[03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:26.680]  foundation hyping racial division so we're all fighting with each other over race instead
[03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:33.080]  of about how all of us collectively are losing our basic freedoms really talking to william
[03:09:33.080 --> 03:09:37.720]  benney former technical director of the national security agency huge whistleblower about some
[03:09:37.720 --> 03:09:43.360]  of the big developments concerning the nsa that have come out and will take some phone
[03:09:43.360 --> 03:09:50.560]  calls if he's up for it with your specific questions and you can tweet at real alec shone's
[03:09:50.560 --> 03:09:58.520]  with your questions as well but our video is up on drudgereport.com up at the very top
[03:09:58.520 --> 03:10:06.400]  of one of the major columns and you can just link through and watch the video on the left
[03:10:06.400 --> 03:10:18.120]  hand side video liberal sign petition to support white privilege tax
[03:10:18.120 --> 03:10:25.480]  and i'd say about what it's the same paradigm out in l.a. eight out of ten people hispanic
[03:10:25.480 --> 03:10:31.680]  it looks like arab and black sign a petition to make white people pay one percent tax doesn't
[03:10:31.680 --> 03:10:35.400]  matter we just came here from russia the matter of your polish doesn't matter if you're an
[03:10:35.400 --> 03:10:40.160]  italian emigrant or romanian and you know of course the hispanics that are out there
[03:10:40.160 --> 03:10:46.160]  are part spanish or portuguese a lot of germans settled in mexico and latin america as well
[03:10:46.160 --> 03:10:52.480]  so you're european as well i mean it's just so crazy that all the reparations talk being
[03:10:52.480 --> 03:10:57.600]  so mainline you could have this going on and meanwhile i wanted to ask william benney
[03:10:57.600 --> 03:11:04.520]  about this it's now come out that obama has a secret database data mining into everything
[03:11:04.520 --> 03:11:08.720]  you do data mining in the local government google you name it to create a database of
[03:11:08.720 --> 03:11:17.360]  your racial connections to start federal fines and fees to quote show white bias you can't
[03:11:17.360 --> 03:11:21.120]  make this up so this is what the data mining is all about then another article dealing
[03:11:21.120 --> 03:11:26.920]  with data mining obama pushes to extend gun control background checks to social security
[03:11:26.920 --> 03:11:35.640]  that if you have a social security disability so you're getting disability you will not
[03:11:35.640 --> 03:11:40.200]  be able to own a gun and will have to turn your guns in not a felon not a criminal done
[03:11:40.200 --> 03:11:44.560]  nothing wrong your handicapped in a wheelchair need a firearm in a bad area the police are
[03:11:44.560 --> 03:11:49.400]  coming to take your gun we reported on this on shatterday and i saw comments on info wars
[03:11:49.400 --> 03:11:56.520]  dot com saying this can't be true this is in the la times today they're going to use a
[03:11:56.520 --> 03:12:03.920]  department of veterans affairs program that they've been using for a decade on veterans
[03:12:03.920 --> 03:12:12.240]  to manage who has their firearms taken it says that right here so see the don't treat list
[03:12:12.240 --> 03:12:18.440]  in the military that have been out for a year been around for four or five years where you
[03:12:18.440 --> 03:12:23.800]  just cannot get treatment for operable cancer operable heart problems you're just given pills
[03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:28.200]  oh your knees bad here's a cane what a doctor blalock say over and over again on this show
[03:12:28.200 --> 03:12:33.200]  about obama care it'll be the model of the da and once we get it will say no knee surgery
[03:12:33.200 --> 03:12:38.880]  here's a cane no cornea surgery here's glasses they got more doctors anybody else in the world
[03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:44.920]  per capita in cuba you just can't get any service and it's now here and it's all managed
[03:12:44.920 --> 03:12:49.960]  by computers and databases william benney is going to be breaking this down i want to get
[03:12:49.960 --> 03:13:00.120]  his take on this first cnbc wesley kark former top u.s. general former top nato general
[03:13:00.120 --> 03:13:08.320]  former supreme allied commander of europe for nato advocates rounding up radicalized disloyal
[03:13:08.320 --> 03:13:14.160]  americans oh like this guy already being watched by the fbi who shot and killed five people
[03:13:14.160 --> 03:13:22.440]  in chattanooga and his dad connected to networks that are under scrutiny just like major assign
[03:13:22.440 --> 03:13:27.920]  the nsa had him with overseas communicates and the cia blocked for two years of investigation
[03:13:27.920 --> 03:13:35.000]  of a sign who was being handled by anwar aulaki and they didn't call that terror either why
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:38.200]  are they doing this because they use it to get more domestic funding but now he wants
[03:13:38.200 --> 03:13:42.120]  to lock people up but when you read deeper they've swapped team william benney they tried
[03:13:42.120 --> 03:13:46.200]  to put him in jail they've put record numbers of journalists in jail they admit at the homeland
[03:13:46.200 --> 03:13:52.080]  security level it was first leaked to us seven years ago is now declassified i'd state police
[03:13:52.080 --> 03:13:56.720]  federal marshal and others leak at me multiple documents on record where they said veterans
[03:13:56.720 --> 03:14:03.440]  gun owners conservatives libertarians constitutionalist and then antiwar activist are listed as the
[03:14:03.440 --> 03:14:10.280]  real terror threat and here's wesley clark just just setting the table for how this
[03:14:10.280 --> 03:14:16.360]  stuff is going to affect everybody data mining that you went in when you had a divorce or
[03:14:16.360 --> 03:14:20.480]  you went in when you had a car wreck and they recommended hey go see a psychologist about
[03:14:20.480 --> 03:14:26.240]  your broken back or whatever and then they said oh we say you have ptsd they just hand
[03:14:26.240 --> 03:14:31.480]  out diagnoses like they hand out candy at a barber shop to kids and then you're told
[03:14:31.480 --> 03:14:38.000]  you can't own a gun anymore i told you it was coming what they do the vets they do to us
[03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:42.480]  what they do to the least of us they do to me christ said what they'll do to unborn babies
[03:14:42.480 --> 03:14:48.560]  what they'll do to old people what they'll do to vets they'll do to everybody i'll play
[03:14:48.560 --> 03:14:54.720]  this was the clark clip and just get william benney's take on the general world itself
[03:14:54.720 --> 03:14:59.200]  he's been to europe he's been speaking around the planet he can tell us about that an update
[03:14:59.200 --> 03:15:02.360]  we're so honored to have him but here is that they'll be with us 15 minutes to the next
[03:15:02.360 --> 03:15:07.200]  hour and we're going to be joined by wane madson formerly the nsa as well with breaking
[03:15:07.200 --> 03:15:11.440]  news but i wanted a full hour with us with us 15 minutes to the next hour he's able
[03:15:11.440 --> 03:15:18.520]  to do that but here's the clip of leslie clark on friday's msnbc well we've got to identify
[03:15:18.520 --> 03:15:25.240]  um the people who are most likely to be radicalized we've got to cut this off at the beginning
[03:15:25.240 --> 03:15:29.200]  there are always a certain number of young people who are alienated they don't get a
[03:15:29.200 --> 03:15:34.440]  job they lost a girlfriend their family doesn't feel happy here and we can watch the signs
[03:15:34.440 --> 03:15:37.920]  of that and there are members of the community who will reach out to those people and bring
[03:15:37.920 --> 03:15:43.080]  them back in and encourage them to look at their blessings here but i do think on a national
[03:15:43.080 --> 03:15:49.040]  policy level we need to look at um at what self radicalization means because we are at
[03:15:49.040 --> 03:15:56.800]  war with um uh this group of terrorists they do have an ideology in world war two if someone
[03:15:56.800 --> 03:16:01.520]  supported nazi germany at the expense of the united states well we didn't say that was
[03:16:01.520 --> 03:16:08.200]  freedom of speech we we put him in a camp we they were prisoners of war so uh if these
[03:16:08.200 --> 03:16:13.120]  people are radicalized and they don't support the united states and they're disloyal to
[03:16:13.120 --> 03:16:17.880]  the united states as a matter of principle fine that's their right it's our right and
[03:16:17.880 --> 03:16:23.120]  our obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict
[03:16:23.120 --> 03:16:27.480]  and i think we're gonna have to increasingly get tough on this and so will europe he goes
[03:16:27.480 --> 03:16:33.200]  on to say here's the problem they're bringing in record numbers of muslims from radical
[03:16:33.200 --> 03:16:40.600]  countries from radical sex i mean they can look into a database find out if somebody
[03:16:40.600 --> 03:16:51.960]  is a hobbyist like these folks were connected to they could see his comments online on facebook
[03:16:51.960 --> 03:16:58.360]  i mean the fbi was already watching him and was told to stand down and william benny talked
[03:16:58.360 --> 03:17:03.720]  about the nsa had the power to stop 911 weren't allowed to use those tools instead everybody
[03:17:03.720 --> 03:17:08.200]  gets spied on because the political class wants these threats to be there wants to keep
[03:17:08.200 --> 03:17:12.000]  them going as william benny has said to take more of our liberties so they can dominate
[03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:19.920]  the general political mass of the people who are not criminals joining us is william benny
[03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:24.400]  former technical director the national security agency i don't know where you want to start
[03:17:24.400 --> 03:17:33.760]  sir we could get into the latest hacking situation with actually madison we could get into corporation
[03:17:33.760 --> 03:17:38.200]  spine we could get into exposed facts the site that has your info posted the tour you
[03:17:38.200 --> 03:17:42.640]  just came off of speaking around the world we could get into this call for interning
[03:17:42.640 --> 03:17:49.840]  islamicists that are radicalized what do you want to tackle first sir and well i
[03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:54.800]  know it's good to be with you again alex but can we start with the opm issue and the
[03:17:54.800 --> 03:18:00.840]  datum hacking and absolutely let's talk about let's talk about the data hacking and more
[03:18:00.840 --> 03:18:09.320]  time in the spotlight for nsl 2014 and review this big court ruling yeah and first of all
[03:18:09.320 --> 03:18:14.280]  with the with the opm when they lose all of that data that's you know that includes things
[03:18:14.280 --> 03:18:18.720]  like when you go for a clearance with the government to work for the government you
[03:18:18.720 --> 03:18:26.000]  fill out a form that's that's an ssf 86 a standard form 86 and that goes through your
[03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:34.240]  entire your entire history work history yeah i health issues your your family all your family
[03:18:34.240 --> 03:18:39.600]  members all their names addresses phone numbers and references all the people you have done
[03:18:39.600 --> 03:18:47.560]  as references plus it also authorizes them to you you have to authorize them to be to
[03:18:47.560 --> 03:18:53.200]  be able to acquire any kind of information health wise financially or anything else that
[03:18:53.200 --> 03:19:00.240]  the fbi wishes to get it's like a universal nsl on every individual that applied so all
[03:19:00.240 --> 03:19:06.840]  of that goes into the files in opm and so in layman's terms the reported chinese hack
[03:19:06.840 --> 03:19:13.840]  that obama's covering up is basically the secret files on federal employees operatives
[03:19:13.840 --> 03:19:18.120]  and others an unprecedented breach who do you think behind it they're saying it's china
[03:19:18.120 --> 03:19:24.120]  mr. bennie you're the expert on this who do you think's really behind it well i i think
[03:19:24.120 --> 03:19:30.240]  they're probably right that it is china i think that's probably what it is yeah but
[03:19:30.240 --> 03:19:35.160]  there's something other other other than that there's something even more threatening here
[03:19:35.160 --> 03:19:41.240]  that is i'm not sure what opm had exactly in their file but if they had all of the they're
[03:19:41.240 --> 03:19:45.440]  supposed to compile all the data of your experience while you're working with the government so
[03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:49.840]  it's like your central personal personnel file which will have a lot of intel on who's
[03:19:49.840 --> 03:19:56.680]  been investigated this is a devastating breach yeah and it would also list for example letters
[03:19:56.680 --> 03:20:04.000]  of appreciation or commendation or awards and things like that which for for your work
[03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:08.040]  history that is if you achieve things in work then they would write them up and you would
[03:20:08.040 --> 03:20:14.160]  get a letter or a or some kind of award achievement award or something like that which would go
[03:20:14.160 --> 03:20:19.960]  into describing what you did so it would be classified so now if that classified data is
[03:20:19.960 --> 03:20:24.560]  in there also that means that chinese have all of that too well mr. bennie this is so
[03:20:24.560 --> 03:20:30.000]  bombshell and it was in the notes to go over i'd like you to start over without me interrupting
[03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:34.820]  explain the data breach that happened the clear hacks that have been going on the glitches
[03:20:34.820 --> 03:20:39.640]  all over the place the war between the u.s. and china and then i want to go back into
[03:20:39.640 --> 03:20:43.600]  the last time you were in studio with us and we're going to put this together with that
[03:20:43.600 --> 03:20:49.440]  on the nightly news tonight where you explained by putting everything on digital databases
[03:20:49.440 --> 03:20:54.800]  and by putting back doors and everything it made our country wide open to foreign hacking
[03:20:54.800 --> 03:21:02.680]  and and is the ultimate tool trojan horse to make us absolutely swiss cheese penetrable
[03:21:02.680 --> 03:21:08.360]  that has now within a month or two of you predicting and has now happened so explain
[03:21:08.360 --> 03:21:13.840]  it to us like we're just the lay public and not two hundred iq super geniuses you know
[03:21:13.840 --> 03:21:23.240]  top code breakers like yourself okay let me if i can just see if i can put it simply
[03:21:23.240 --> 03:21:27.880]  if for example you have a bunch of protected information that you want to that you have
[03:21:27.880 --> 03:21:32.440]  classified or or information about the people who are working for you're assembling it in
[03:21:32.440 --> 03:21:38.840]  a database so you can help manage your business okay the industry would do this too so but
[03:21:38.840 --> 03:21:44.480]  if you put it in a database you have to try to ensure that that database is secure well
[03:21:44.480 --> 03:21:49.960]  if nsa is going along and other intelligence agencies around the world are going along
[03:21:49.960 --> 03:21:57.200]  trying to find weaknesses in operating systems or or firewalls or other kinds of encryption
[03:21:57.200 --> 03:22:01.520]  or things like that and when they find them they don't tell anybody so that what they
[03:22:01.520 --> 03:22:06.560]  can do it gives them a window into everything that they are doing well that simply says
[03:22:06.560 --> 03:22:12.600]  they're allowing a flaw in the system to exist and continue which can be discovered by anybody
[03:22:12.600 --> 03:22:16.640]  in the world i mean they have no they have no monopoly on smart people there's lots of
[03:22:16.640 --> 03:22:21.200]  smart people all around the world so that that means that they eventually have a chance
[03:22:21.200 --> 03:22:26.480]  to get in see that too which means that that then makes everybody with that system vulnerable
[03:22:26.480 --> 03:22:33.280]  so they leave the holes they don't patch them please continue yeah they leave them that
[03:22:33.280 --> 03:22:37.600]  way because they want to be able to look into what what you're doing so that they know they
[03:22:37.600 --> 03:22:42.560]  have a window in but other people can discover that too and when the other people do it like
[03:22:42.560 --> 03:22:47.640]  the chinese for example that means that they can come across and take everything that's
[03:22:47.640 --> 03:22:55.920]  in those files also so and when so now let's say to say the entire 21 million huge government
[03:22:55.920 --> 03:23:04.000]  database of operatives and spies and hackers you name it has now been grabbed by the communist
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:09.360]  chinese plus potentially some of the awards that they they've all achieved over their
[03:23:09.360 --> 03:23:14.000]  work history which means it may outline some of the programs that are existing in some
[03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:18.240]  of the techniques that were used to achieve the success but almost no coverage of this
[03:23:18.240 --> 03:23:22.320]  we you know we've heard snowden's the biggest demon in the world for exposing illegal spying
[03:23:22.320 --> 03:23:28.080]  on the people but not actually releasing the intel and now we have the system itself built
[03:23:28.080 --> 03:23:33.200]  so government agencies should go in and out of there and not have their tracks seen to
[03:23:33.200 --> 03:23:38.400]  use this for power now because of their traitorous activity we've seen a devastating blow to
[03:23:38.400 --> 03:23:43.520]  national security right and it also outlines all the contractors that are involved with
[03:23:43.520 --> 03:23:50.160]  the nsa or cia or anybody else and it gives them like for example that's how the chinese
[03:23:50.160 --> 03:23:55.760]  came up with the the design of the f-35 you know that's the same design as ours but they
[03:23:55.760 --> 03:24:00.720]  got that they got it from us they didn't get it from you know from having to do the development
[03:24:00.720 --> 03:24:06.240]  themselves let us spend 400 billion now they can just take it for free yeah they take it
[03:24:06.240 --> 03:24:10.720]  from the contractors yeah who are but you know the weaknesses then are system-wide all the
[03:24:10.720 --> 03:24:15.200]  contractors that are involved also have to be protected in the same level and they're not
[03:24:15.200 --> 03:24:20.720]  and that's why they're being able to get into these systems so i mean it makes everybody
[03:24:20.720 --> 03:24:25.920]  vulnerable why are we seeing prosecution of journalists that expose the crime but then
[03:24:25.920 --> 03:24:31.040]  they let the communist chinese operatives also work in these secret facilities as well
[03:24:31.040 --> 03:24:36.080]  who are then physically as a brain trust uh taking the plans out of the building
[03:24:37.520 --> 03:24:42.640]  uh you know it's beyond me i can't understand this myself i really can't i mean it's it's
[03:24:42.640 --> 03:24:47.840]  absolutely astounding how can people do this i just don't understand it i mean if whistleblowers
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:53.440]  come out and show that there's a problem or an issue or something illegal or something you know
[03:24:53.440 --> 03:24:58.480]  criminal or some fraud or waste why i mean it would be it's in the vested interest of the
[03:24:58.480 --> 03:25:03.280]  organization the government of the industry to address that issue if they want to improve
[03:25:03.840 --> 03:25:08.160]  as a as a corporation or a government they should address it to fix the problem
[03:25:08.160 --> 03:25:13.920]  instead of letting the problem fester and continue because it only allows you know all these
[03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:21.120]  follow-on things to happen so you know it's it's in almost infallible infallible to me as to how
[03:25:21.120 --> 03:25:27.520]  they would you know just let this continue like that it shows a really decadent attitude
[03:25:27.520 --> 03:25:33.520]  and a laissez-faire attitude by these people this smells like an empire on the verge of collapse to
[03:25:33.520 --> 03:25:40.160]  me just all of this craziness going on uh really really stinks to high heaven yeah it certainly
[03:25:40.160 --> 03:25:46.400]  does yeah i absolutely agree to that well i've asked some of the questions here you you brought
[03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:53.200]  up these huge data breaches then that ties in as you said commercial outfits everything from amazon
[03:25:53.200 --> 03:25:58.880]  to bank of america to ashley madison with 37 million cheaters on it now they're saying they're
[03:25:58.880 --> 03:26:03.360]  going to publish that in the database so men and women can find out if their husband or wife cheated
[03:26:03.360 --> 03:26:09.520]  on him i mean it just seems like all this open source open code backdoor open stuff is is going
[03:26:09.520 --> 03:26:16.320]  to bring down the world it certainly makes the world vulnerable to all kinds of the manipulation
[03:26:16.320 --> 03:26:22.400]  and monitoring and uh all kinds of blackmail or things like that happening anywhere in the world
[03:26:22.400 --> 03:26:28.080]  for anybody not not just uh it's not just the average citizen but it's also members of parliaments
[03:26:28.080 --> 03:26:34.400]  around the world government officials everybody what about planted info i don't have seen a
[03:26:34.400 --> 03:26:38.720]  lot of cases or different agencies in this government and others plant stuff on people's
[03:26:38.720 --> 03:26:45.360]  computers isn't it easy for them to go in and plant stuff with these backdoors yeah you see that's
[03:26:45.360 --> 03:26:52.640]  part of the problem that that that makes that all possible too and that means that you know it gets
[03:26:52.640 --> 03:26:57.680]  back to a question of trust how can you trust a government that has the capability to do that
[03:26:57.680 --> 03:27:02.320]  and they're and if they do everything in secret you never know what they're doing and so it's
[03:27:02.320 --> 03:27:07.440]  very difficult to prove one way or another that they did or didn't do that uh the way we did it
[03:27:07.440 --> 03:27:12.880]  of course was to have uh duplicate copies of everything we ever did in multiple places so
[03:27:12.880 --> 03:27:17.920]  you're backed up so that if they manipulate anything uh then we could show it from a record
[03:27:17.920 --> 03:27:22.720]  copy from another source that we had weren't you able to do that yourself to try to set you up but
[03:27:22.720 --> 03:27:29.920]  you somebody inside warns you uh well we we didn't have any it was basically we understood how these
[03:27:29.920 --> 03:27:36.640]  people operated so we did the backups like i just said and so that when they took data and tried to
[03:27:36.640 --> 03:27:42.320]  accuse us of something we already had retrieved all the data from our backup sources and so they
[03:27:42.320 --> 03:27:49.120]  couldn't claim things that didn't exist in our backup sources so we could show in court uh record
[03:27:49.120 --> 03:27:54.400]  copy you know emails things like that that would uh demonstrate that what they were saying was untrue
[03:27:55.520 --> 03:27:58.960]  i'm going from memory last time you were physically here that there was some other
[03:27:58.960 --> 03:28:04.560]  facet to it though where someone inside basically stopped them from being able to set you up you
[03:28:04.560 --> 03:28:09.680]  don't know who they are though oh uh that was the uh in the department of justice there was
[03:28:09.680 --> 03:28:15.760]  the somebody felt really bad about you know excuse me what they were doing to us so they sent us a
[03:28:15.760 --> 03:28:23.040]  copy of their draft indictment which which showed all of the uh all all the falsehoods that they
[03:28:23.040 --> 03:28:29.200]  were attempting to claim against us so there was somebody in the doj who actually felt bad about
[03:28:29.200 --> 03:28:35.520]  it so i you know not everybody there is bad is what i'm trying to say sure being in government for
[03:28:35.520 --> 03:28:42.800]  decades being admittedly at one of the top uh code breakers uh ever moving up from the you know
[03:28:42.800 --> 03:28:47.600]  mailroom to the very top of the organization basically to use that allegory or that analogy
[03:28:48.960 --> 03:28:50.960]  and we're going to break here in a moment just a quick question
[03:28:51.680 --> 03:28:56.640]  what percentage as a guesstimation of government would you say are good guys versus bad guys
[03:28:58.640 --> 03:29:04.480]  i think that the uh the corruption of people and and the conversion to the dark side starts
[03:29:04.480 --> 03:29:12.320]  around grade 15 which is probably uh which is the government service grade uh which is like a uh
[03:29:12.320 --> 03:29:18.080]  a lieutenant or a bird colonel in the military at that level on up is where the corruption really
[03:29:18.080 --> 03:29:24.720]  starts and so at that point uh i'd say you're talking maybe about uh 15 percent of the people
[03:29:25.600 --> 03:29:29.440]  and it runs basically on a military system you're just in plain clothes in fact you were a
[03:29:29.440 --> 03:29:36.160]  what level were you a general uh i was like it's not quite equivalent to the military but it's like
[03:29:36.160 --> 03:29:42.160]  a 1.5 general yeah star general yeah we'll be right back stay there william benny former technical

[03:30:10.080 --> 03:30:17.120]  how when the democrats showed their true colors you got angry and you elected republicans and then
[03:30:17.120 --> 03:30:23.200]  when the republicans showed their true colors you got angry and elected democrats and when anyone
[03:30:23.200 --> 03:30:29.040]  suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your
[03:30:29.040 --> 03:30:36.880]  best interest you acted like they were crazy but the real definition of crazy is doing the same

[03:37:31.920 --> 03:37:37.920]  right there okay mr benny i've been asking some of the questions former head of technical operations
[03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:45.920]  at the nsa is our guest if folks just joined us former technical leader for the intelligence
[03:37:45.920 --> 03:37:52.080]  with the nsa before becoming a whistleblower in 2001 to congress he did it the proper way until
[03:37:52.080 --> 03:37:56.480]  he got swat teamed as one of the 30 years of the agency benny has been described as one of the big
[03:37:56.480 --> 03:38:01.280]  best analysts and code breakers in nsa history benny continues to speak out on the nsa's data
[03:38:01.280 --> 03:38:08.080]  collection expose facts.org i've got a lot of questions to answer to try to get you to answer
[03:38:08.720 --> 03:38:15.920]  but i also want to hear what you think is important front and center so go ahead mr benny what else
[03:38:15.920 --> 03:38:22.880]  should the public know about from your expert perspective well relevant to relative to the
[03:38:22.880 --> 03:38:28.880]  opm loss of data i mean they could have easily encrypted that data it doesn't matter whether
[03:38:28.880 --> 03:38:35.040]  you have data stored on an old set of equipment or a new set it's still stored in database in a
[03:38:35.040 --> 03:38:40.640]  database you can encrypt the database no matter where it is so they could have done that all along
[03:38:40.640 --> 03:38:46.320]  but they didn't so they even made them even more vulnerable you know so that would have been a simple
[03:38:46.320 --> 03:38:51.120]  solution for them to do and and to help protect that information and they didn't even do that
[03:38:51.760 --> 03:38:56.000]  so i mean they're not making good decisions here period i mean these are not people who are
[03:38:56.000 --> 03:39:00.960]  competent that uh at securing anything i mean the same is true with nsa i mean they're doing this
[03:39:00.960 --> 03:39:06.720]  bulk acquisition of information and burying themselves and i i keep i use the case of the
[03:39:06.720 --> 03:39:12.160]  garland shooting garland texas shooting down there where you know a member of anonymous tipped off the
[03:39:12.160 --> 03:39:16.560]  local police down there that they were going to be attacked two days before the attack occurred
[03:39:16.560 --> 03:39:20.640]  and yet our intelligence community for which we pay over a hundred billion dollars a year
[03:39:21.600 --> 03:39:26.400]  said absolutely nothing why because they're buried in so much information they can't find it
[03:39:26.400 --> 03:39:31.920]  whereas anonymous was very focused at a focused attack a focused look at the people who were
[03:39:31.920 --> 03:39:36.960]  involved in terrorism or were showing signs of being radicalized and and they found the information
[03:39:36.960 --> 03:39:43.360]  whereas our intelligence community didn't and so they have been competent at the top levels
[03:39:43.360 --> 03:39:50.480]  of all these agencies are adopting the incorrect process for the entire agencies of the of the
[03:39:50.480 --> 03:39:56.000]  intelligence community that means they're they're making us all more vulnerable than we've ever
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:40:01.600]  been before so i mean that's so important that people don't seem to realize well they keep
[03:40:01.600 --> 03:40:06.880]  saying they're doing this for our protection well sort of the nazis in 1933 when they you know took
[03:40:06.880 --> 03:40:12.800]  power to do anything with anybody with the ndaa section 1021 which is special order 48 for the
[03:40:12.800 --> 03:40:17.760]  nazis the same kind of thing has occurred down through history over and over again and if their
[03:40:17.760 --> 03:40:23.040]  objective is to protect us then they ought to do do things smartly professionally and in with
[03:40:23.040 --> 03:40:32.000]  discipline and that's what they're not doing so what is the end game i mean obviously hundreds
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:36.640]  of billions of dollars are being made a year by private contractors and big companies so they're
[03:40:36.640 --> 03:40:41.760]  always lobbying for more and more of this but then you have giant sprawling facilities in
[03:40:41.760 --> 03:40:48.320]  utah texas maryland all over the place not to mention 800 000 people that are outside government
[03:40:48.320 --> 03:40:57.920]  with security clearances building the ultimate hackable uh open door nightmare system how do
[03:40:57.920 --> 03:41:02.320]  they think they're going to get away with this i mean it's it's going to create more and more
[03:41:02.320 --> 03:41:09.200]  disasters now the chinese have stolen 21 million background dossiers on federal employees and
[03:41:09.200 --> 03:41:16.560]  operatives i mean this is just unprecedented and nobody's getting in trouble for it yeah i think
[03:41:16.560 --> 03:41:23.600]  uh i think they feel that the the this is what uh president is now really warned us about back in
[03:41:23.600 --> 03:41:30.560]  the 1961 was the power of the evolving at the time military industrial complex is the way he called
[03:41:30.560 --> 03:41:35.520]  it but it's really the military industrial intelligence complex which includes government
[03:41:37.040 --> 03:41:42.000]  the the supposed intelligence committees that were supposed to prevent spying on us citizens
[03:41:42.000 --> 03:41:48.320]  as a result of the flies laws back in 1978 in fact are now advocates for spying on us citizens
[03:41:48.880 --> 03:41:53.840]  so that's the kind of that's the kind of reversal that's gone on i mean our entire government in
[03:41:53.840 --> 03:41:59.440]  the intelligence-related field national security if you will has now felt that they're above the
[03:41:59.440 --> 03:42:04.240]  law they're above the constitution they can do anything they feel is necessary and nobody's
[03:42:04.240 --> 03:42:08.880]  going to stop them and everybody's afraid to do anything because they'll feel they'll feel
[03:42:08.880 --> 03:42:14.400]  that the political people started doing they would they would fear fear being labeled you know
[03:42:14.400 --> 03:42:20.560]  weak on terror weak on national security and and they don't want that label and so therefore they
[03:42:20.560 --> 03:42:27.040]  go along to get along well take ran poll he said four years ago don't fund the free syrian army
[03:42:27.040 --> 03:42:33.360]  they're really a hobbyist out of Saudi Arabia and then now they go on the news and say because
[03:42:33.360 --> 03:42:38.720]  you're not for the patriot act extension or illegal nsa spying it's going to be your fault when we
[03:42:38.720 --> 03:42:45.040]  get hit by terrorists when they have this giant nsa system and it didn't stop anything that's
[03:42:45.040 --> 03:42:49.440]  exactly right and that's because they're not doing a professional disciplined approach the
[03:42:49.440 --> 03:42:54.720]  management is directing something that is focused on getting more money and more money and building
[03:42:54.720 --> 03:43:00.800]  a bigger bureaucracy and not actually solving problems that's that's what the that's what they
[03:43:00.800 --> 03:43:05.520]  that's the way they've approached this entire problem from the beginning even before 9 11
[03:43:05.520 --> 03:43:11.600]  I mean it was basically they allowed things to happen without actually trying to stop
[03:43:11.600 --> 03:43:16.080]  her and doing smart things that is to make that happen make that possible you know they just
[03:43:16.960 --> 03:43:21.680]  they just were looking for money as the main objective well we know what's going to happen
[03:43:21.680 --> 03:43:28.720]  the Chinese are going to use that database to make connections between the people that are on
[03:43:28.720 --> 03:43:33.520]  the list and operatives inside their country and they're undoubtedly going to end up imprisoning
[03:43:33.520 --> 03:43:41.360]  or killing us operatives inside china and rolling up the entire western operation and it only seems
[03:43:41.360 --> 03:43:47.120]  like it's a matter of time before this confrontation with china escalates but so many of our leaders
[03:43:47.120 --> 03:43:51.600]  are heavily invested in china they're basically already double agents to china I mean this just
[03:43:51.600 --> 03:43:58.720]  seems like a recipe for disaster I couldn't agree more I mean we're not doing anything smart in most
[03:43:58.720 --> 03:44:04.720]  international arenas I mean it's just not it's just not smart to do the taking the and doing
[03:44:04.720 --> 03:44:09.120]  the procedures that we're doing even like with the I don't understand why we didn't put more
[03:44:09.760 --> 03:44:14.240]  pressure on the Iranians to get a better deal I mean why didn't we as for a better deal
[03:44:14.240 --> 03:44:18.320]  it seemed like we caved on every point that they were asking on I didn't you know it doesn't make
[03:44:18.320 --> 03:44:24.560]  a lot of sense to me to do that you know usually I can figure out what's going on I can't figure
[03:44:24.560 --> 03:44:30.960]  out what's going on with Iran because the west is clearly funding Iran's archenemy Saudi Arabia
[03:44:30.960 --> 03:44:38.240]  and allowing them to run a a a sunni takeover and then meanwhile we've been fighting a proxy war
[03:44:38.240 --> 03:44:45.520]  against Iran in Syria but then on the other hand we make a one-sided deal that is for Iran and then
[03:44:45.520 --> 03:44:52.800]  they make fun of us I mean I can't figure out what's going on yes it's hard to follow the
[03:44:52.800 --> 03:44:58.640]  bouncing ball in that arena that's that's for sure I really don't I really don't know what to
[03:44:58.640 --> 03:45:04.880]  say myself I don't know how to I don't know how to you know characterize that meanwhile for those
[03:45:04.880 --> 03:45:12.080]  that just joined us you got SWAT teamed for going and whistleblowing to congress and they tried to
[03:45:12.080 --> 03:45:17.520]  put you and others in prison so that's who this government's focused on is people like you that
[03:45:17.520 --> 03:45:22.800]  built so much of what they're misusing today so I guess honorable service to the republic that's
[03:45:22.800 --> 03:45:31.600]  legal and lawful is punished being an absolute whore trader is is rewarded yeah I think I refer
[03:45:31.600 --> 03:45:40.080]  to that as population control which is the objective of mass acquisition of data on everybody in
[03:45:40.080 --> 03:45:47.040]  your country we're on the planet it's really population control so that's really what they're
[03:45:47.040 --> 03:45:52.560]  after I think that way they get to manipulate anybody they want to do anything they want them
[03:45:52.560 --> 03:45:59.600]  to do and then they just hope that other governments and corporations are too incompetent
[03:46:00.240 --> 03:46:06.000]  to know how to use the data that they can get as well that just sounds arrogant well so far it's
[03:46:06.000 --> 03:46:11.360]  been pretty much true except that there's like some of the thing cases when they have these
[03:46:11.360 --> 03:46:16.880]  break-ins and theft of information why that shows that others are starting to wise up too
[03:46:18.240 --> 03:46:25.040]  so I mean it means that that it simply means that they can't they can't guarantee that they
[03:46:25.040 --> 03:46:28.160]  will be the only ones to be able to leverage this information
[03:46:31.360 --> 03:46:35.920]  we'll take Ashley Madison from the time I heard that being promoted on talk radio
[03:46:35.920 --> 03:46:41.360]  by Howard Stern and people I just immediately thought that sounds like a recipe for blackmail and
[03:46:41.360 --> 03:46:46.560]  then now 37 million people that have reportedly cheated on their spouses that database has now
[03:46:46.560 --> 03:46:52.480]  been stolen why would anyone if they were going to cheat on their spouse go do it on a mass database
[03:46:54.320 --> 03:47:01.040]  yeah that's uh really kind of uh it's really people don't realize what's what's possible today
[03:47:01.040 --> 03:47:07.520]  and you know with the with the insist information systems we have they just don't realize that
[03:47:07.520 --> 03:47:13.520]  this information is out there forever for just about anybody to get to it if they know how to do that
[03:47:15.920 --> 03:47:19.520]  William many former technical director of the national security agency
[03:47:20.320 --> 03:47:26.880]  is our guest and we're here going over some of the latest developments what do you make of a whole
[03:47:26.880 --> 03:47:32.800]  bunch of financial websites the wall street journal airlines going down two weeks ago the
[03:47:32.800 --> 03:47:39.200]  new york stock exchange going down and they said it was not connected to a hack do you have any
[03:47:39.200 --> 03:47:45.520]  info on that mr benny I don't have any first-hand knowledge of that but but it sure sounds suspicious
[03:47:45.520 --> 03:47:52.000]  even by simply a time coincidence that those things are happening without some central or
[03:47:52.000 --> 03:47:57.600]  coordinated action uh what's the effort to try to figure the random probability of that actually
[03:47:57.600 --> 03:48:04.800]  being that that way and it gets pretty the random probability is pretty pretty low in my view anyway
[03:48:05.600 --> 03:48:12.720]  since you were last on clapper of course for folks that don't know who headed up the nsa
[03:48:13.920 --> 03:48:20.640]  his lawyer came out and said that uh he was forgetful he didn't mean to lie saying the nsa
[03:48:20.640 --> 03:48:27.120]  does no domestic spying he was just forgetful what do you make of that I think that's just a
[03:48:27.120 --> 03:48:34.560]  bunch of hogwash I mean he was given those questions you know two days in advance so how can
[03:48:34.560 --> 03:48:40.400]  you be forgetful when you're given the questions you're going to be asked asked asked in in the in
[03:48:40.400 --> 03:48:45.280]  committee and you go over them how can you forget that you went over them I mean that's just a bunch
[03:48:45.280 --> 03:48:50.160]  of malarkey well we see how the supreme court's acting we see how congress is acting doing whatever
[03:48:50.160 --> 03:48:55.280]  foreign corporations want we've been conquered with blackmail I think it's clear it's come out
[03:48:55.280 --> 03:49:01.440]  that the british parliament's being blackmailed with their mi6 spying it's come out the cia is spying
[03:49:01.440 --> 03:49:07.280]  on the senate uh intelligence committee I mean I think it's pretty clear we've been hoisted on our
[03:49:07.280 --> 03:49:13.200]  own petard we've been hung in our own rope uh and that this technology's been used to overthrow the
[03:49:13.200 --> 03:49:20.800]  country uh I don't have a I don't I can't argue with that that sounds very much on the mark to me
[03:49:22.800 --> 03:49:27.040]  in your gut do you think we're going to be able to reverse this or get it under control
[03:49:28.560 --> 03:49:34.400]  yeah I really do because the one of the one of the basic the the fundamental thing that
[03:49:34.400 --> 03:49:39.760]  they're most afraid of is being exposed I mean that's that's why I think there's a lot of uh
[03:49:39.760 --> 03:49:47.440]  there's a lot of uh people who talk directly about issues uh create a real firestorm and
[03:49:47.440 --> 03:49:52.560]  are opposed by any number of people that's because nobody wants to address the real hard problems
[03:49:53.360 --> 03:49:58.560]  uh and uh when it comes to it they try to cover up things that they're doing so
[03:49:59.360 --> 03:50:03.840]  so they're very sensitive to having sunlight put on the events that or the things that they've
[03:50:03.840 --> 03:50:10.160]  actually done and and some of that is coming out and even even being more discussed in in Europe
[03:50:10.160 --> 03:50:15.520]  now for example the Bundestag is finding out that the BND had agreements with certain limited
[03:50:15.520 --> 03:50:20.560]  numbers of members of the higher level members of their government to do certain things with
[03:50:20.560 --> 03:50:25.120]  NSA that the rest of the Bundestag didn't know about well the same was true in our congress
[03:50:25.120 --> 03:50:32.960]  you see we exported that technique of how to co-opt in uh legislative areas around the world
[03:50:32.960 --> 03:50:37.760]  how to give data to select people and then make them even more prominent because they're operatives
[03:50:37.760 --> 03:50:42.640]  it's it's it's espionage let's come back and talk about that when Merkel claimed a year ago she
[03:50:42.640 --> 03:50:47.680]  didn't know about NSA spying and of course she did William Benny's been over to Europe's been speaking

[03:54:59.760 --> 03:55:09.440]  for our guest one of the top nsa experts out there 800-259-9231 but uh yeah you've been out of the
[03:55:09.440 --> 03:55:14.960]  country and and traveling the last few months mr benny uh tell us about the progress you're making
[03:55:14.960 --> 03:55:19.520]  alerting the world to what's happening because whether it's here in the us or germany or
[03:55:19.520 --> 03:55:25.920]  anywhere there are laws against this this is not legal by any stretch of the imagination
[03:55:25.920 --> 03:55:31.360]  so how are they getting away with it uh well that's what i've been suggesting when i go to
[03:55:32.400 --> 03:55:37.920]  like for example germany or europe europe europe anywhere in europe i mean european union and
[03:55:37.920 --> 03:55:44.400]  as the laws against the data transfer without the permission of the individuals involved i mean
[03:55:44.400 --> 03:55:50.320]  they do information even if it's held by telecoms or any kind of service provider
[03:55:50.320 --> 03:55:56.240]  that it still is that information is the property of the individual and so if they want to transfer
[03:55:56.240 --> 03:56:00.880]  it somewhere give it to somebody else or share it then they have to get the permission of that
[03:56:00.880 --> 03:56:06.880]  individual to do that otherwise it's against their laws so so what that really means to me and then
[03:56:06.880 --> 03:56:11.520]  what i keep suggesting over there is that they should file lawsuits and criminal prosecution
[03:56:11.520 --> 03:56:16.080]  against all these people for uh sharing the information all of the companies at least
[03:56:16.880 --> 03:56:19.920]  if they don't want to do it against the u.s government then they should do it against
[03:56:19.920 --> 03:56:26.400]  the companies that are participating in this data sharing uh specifically with the prism program
[03:56:26.400 --> 03:56:33.200]  or or any other of the tapping programs even even the the the bundistog is found out i believe
[03:56:33.200 --> 03:56:39.360]  that uh just recently that the uh the bnd was cooperating with nsa and sharing data about
[03:56:39.360 --> 03:56:45.120]  german citizens and other european citizens as well with the nsa so i mean that's also against
[03:56:45.120 --> 03:56:51.920]  their laws so i mean they have ample opportunity if they want to to charge these organizations
[03:56:51.920 --> 03:57:01.440]  with criminal prosecution i mean they just need to start doing it or what comes next i mean if we
[03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:08.560]  don't reverse this big brother on steroids move where does it end i mean you know samsung six
[03:57:08.560 --> 03:57:14.000]  months ago with all the suit customers that buy their new tv's tells you we watch and listen to you
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:22.400]  and sell the data i mean i mean not just watch your patterns of what you view to sell a algorithm
[03:57:22.400 --> 03:57:29.200]  profile but they're actually listening and watching you i mean how crazy is that
[03:57:29.200 --> 03:57:34.720]  i know it's insane i mean why would anybody want to buy a product like that i mean i certainly
[03:57:34.720 --> 03:57:42.560]  wouldn't i mean it's it's like it's like that uh that the case uh when uh a school gave uh laptop
[03:57:42.560 --> 03:57:48.160]  computers to the kids pennsylvania yeah and they started uh spying on them when they were at home
[03:57:48.160 --> 03:57:53.680]  i mean that's that's certainly a violation of their privacy rights well and then why exactly and it
[03:57:53.680 --> 03:57:58.800]  was the school themselves that announced it like it was a good thing you know mr benny it's almost
[03:57:58.800 --> 03:58:03.920]  like a revolution of these crazy control freaks against the rest of us they're just doing it
[03:58:03.920 --> 03:58:09.600]  like it's their religion no matter how crazy sorry go ahead no no that's absolutely right no i agree
[03:58:09.600 --> 03:58:15.040]  totally with that i mean it's a it's a matter of standing up for your rights i mean i've never i have
[03:58:15.040 --> 03:58:20.400]  never known americans not to stand up for their rights until this this current cycle with the
[03:58:20.400 --> 03:58:24.880]  terrorism i mean and what they've done is they fear mongered us into thinking that oh we're all in
[03:58:24.880 --> 03:58:29.600]  so much danger we better just forget about our rights and let them do anything they want to
[03:58:29.600 --> 03:58:34.480]  try to protect us well they aren't really trying to protect us if they were they wouldn't be doing
[03:58:34.480 --> 03:58:39.600]  this bulk acquisition they'd be doing the target exactly stay there and explain that in 70 seconds
