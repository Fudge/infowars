[00:00.000 --> 00:23.880]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:23.880 --> 00:27.100]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:27.100 --> 00:32.200]  I'm very calm today. I'm very, very focused.
[00:32.200 --> 00:36.040]  When we come back from break after I hear the special report, I'm going to lay out the
[00:36.040 --> 00:39.320]  choice humanity has to make right now.
[00:39.320 --> 00:44.240]  It's already February 12, 2017. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:44.240 --> 00:48.760]  This is going to be a very important transmission. Every broadcast is important, but today it's
[00:48.760 --> 00:55.240]  never been clear exactly what we're facing as a civilization, as a nation, as a species.
[00:55.240 --> 01:01.320]  But first, Mark Dice exposes the champions of fake news, CNN.
[01:01.320 --> 01:06.840]  In what's either a hilarious coincidence or a pathetic attempt at censorship or retribution
[01:06.840 --> 01:13.720]  by a producer, CNN had some mysterious technical issues as soon as Bernie Sanders joked that
[01:13.720 --> 01:16.040]  they were fake news.
[01:16.040 --> 01:20.520]  He says he knows nothing about it, hasn't seen any of these reports. Is that a problem?
[01:20.520 --> 01:27.400]  Well, I don't know. Maybe he was watching CNN fake news. What do you think?
[01:27.400 --> 01:28.400]  You don't buy.
[01:28.400 --> 01:29.400]  That was a joke.
[01:29.400 --> 01:33.440]  I know it was a joke. I'm saying you don't buy what he said, obviously.
[01:33.440 --> 01:34.440]  Aaron?
[01:34.440 --> 01:35.440]  Yes.
[01:35.440 --> 01:41.520]  I'm sorry, Senator. I'm saying you obviously don't buy what he said. You believe that he
[01:41.520 --> 01:42.520]  has seen these reports?
[01:42.520 --> 01:43.520]  I mean, to your point.
[01:43.520 --> 01:45.040]  Kevin, I'm not. Are we on?
[01:45.040 --> 01:50.480]  It looks like we've lost connection with Senator Sanders. So let's just try to get that back
[01:50.480 --> 01:53.480]  up. Do we have him back?
[01:53.480 --> 01:59.680]  Okay, so what we're going to do is take a break. I don't want to waste our time.
[01:59.680 --> 02:04.000]  The clowns at CNN, the Caterford News Network, are getting increasingly more angry that people
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.240]  keep calling them fake news. In case you missed it, here's Chris Cuomo saying that by calling
[02:09.240 --> 02:13.600]  them fake news, it's like using the N-word.
[02:13.600 --> 02:22.000]  Fake news is the worst thing that you can call a journalist. It's like an ethnic disparagement.
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.240]  We all have these ugly words for people. That's the one for journalists. And David, he just
[02:27.240 --> 02:29.040]  keeps doubling down.
[02:29.040 --> 02:31.040]  Yes, we do. We do.
[02:31.040 --> 02:34.680]  We're going to keep pounding nails in your coffin until your careers are toast. Because
[02:34.680 --> 02:38.320]  when you spread fake news, like claiming that your network are the only people that are
[02:38.320 --> 02:44.160]  allowed to legally read the documents leaked by WikiLeaks, you don't deserve a career in
[02:44.160 --> 02:45.160]  journalism.
[02:45.160 --> 02:50.560]  Also interesting is, remember, it's illegal to possess these stolen documents. It's different
[02:50.560 --> 02:54.760]  for the media. So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us. And in full
[02:54.760 --> 02:58.760]  disclosure, let's take a look at what is in there and what it means. Joining us now,
[02:58.760 --> 02:59.760]  CNN.
[02:59.760 --> 03:03.120]  Yes, don't read the WikiLeaks documents for yourself. Don't get it from the primary source,
[03:03.120 --> 03:09.800]  which is WikiLeaks. Go through the trusted filter and analysts at CNN, a network which
[03:09.800 --> 03:14.960]  employs clowns like Mark Lamont Hill, who claim that black people can't be racist.
[03:14.960 --> 03:19.800]  I'd say that the Black Lives Matter movement is racist is bizarre to me, not just because
[03:19.800 --> 03:23.840]  black people don't have the institutional power to be racist or to deploy racism, but
[03:23.840 --> 03:27.160]  because the movement is called for justice. It's called for demilitarization. It's called
[03:27.160 --> 03:28.160]  for nonviolence.
[03:28.160 --> 03:35.000]  It chants pigs in a blanket fry like bacon. 99% of the time when they protest and riot,
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.720]  it's because an armed and dangerous thug had to unfortunately be put down by police before
[03:40.720 --> 03:45.440]  he could shoot them or others. We're talking about a fake news network that did everything
[03:45.440 --> 03:51.340]  that they could to perpetuate one of the biggest lies in recent years, the lie of the hands
[03:51.340 --> 03:58.760]  up don't shoot myth, which even the most liberal of news outlets now admit was a total lie.
[03:58.760 --> 04:03.480]  Regarding the Michael Brown being 6 foot 4, 300 pound thug in Ferguson, Missouri, the
[04:03.480 --> 04:08.600]  claims that he had his hands up and said don't shoot have been completely debunked and every
[04:08.600 --> 04:12.760]  liberal mainstream media outlet now admits this.
[04:12.760 --> 04:17.640]  The clown news network is so pathetic that even an 11 year old can beat them in a debate
[04:17.640 --> 04:21.520]  and no, I'm not kidding. Look what happened when the clown news network asked this young
[04:21.520 --> 04:26.720]  boy about the insults and the harsh language that Donald Trump uses.
[04:26.720 --> 04:33.120]  Matthew a lot has been made in this campaign of the language that is used, the name calling
[04:33.120 --> 04:38.280]  that's been used, especially in the primary as an 11 year old watching it. What's your
[04:38.280 --> 04:40.880]  reaction?
[04:40.880 --> 04:45.600]  I really think that listening to a few bad words coming out of Donald Trump is a lot
[04:45.600 --> 04:50.320]  better than people getting blown up by terrorists, people getting burned alive, people being
[04:50.320 --> 04:53.480]  heads being chopped off and people getting drowned.
[04:53.480 --> 04:58.000]  Outsmarted by an 11 year old, that's the clown news network. I'm Mark Dice, thanks
[04:58.000 --> 04:59.000]  for watching.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.480]  You're investing in your health and supporting the info war when you visit infowarslife.com
[05:03.480 --> 05:08.000]  and purchase your supply of survival shield x2 nation iodine and all the great products
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.800]  infowarslife.com. As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers,
[05:12.800 --> 05:18.360]  scientists and the answer is clear. Iodine is key, is paramount and there's still so
[05:18.360 --> 05:22.520]  much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[05:22.520 --> 05:28.320]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7000 feet to gather these purple
[05:28.320 --> 05:33.520]  blue crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine. On top of that, we also screen our iodine
[05:33.520 --> 05:38.320]  for radiation before bottling. It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there. Quite
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.960]  frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield, Nathan Iodine, that major
[05:42.960 --> 05:47.040]  brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that
[05:47.040 --> 05:52.480]  they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have. It is exclusive
[05:52.480 --> 06:18.480]  to infowarslife.com and the infowarslife family of incredible products.
[06:18.480 --> 06:43.160]  Thank you very much for watching this video. We play the songs that sound more like everyone
[06:43.160 --> 07:04.340]  is
[07:04.340 --> 07:10.140]  talking about.
[07:10.140 --> 07:14.460]  broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday transmission. We're here for the next two
[07:14.460 --> 07:20.460]  hours. It's already the 12th day of February 2017. I'll be back tomorrow
[07:20.460 --> 07:23.980]  obviously with a weekday transmission, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central. The news
[07:23.980 --> 07:28.180]  website that the entire global crime syndicate is demonizing and trying to
[07:28.180 --> 07:35.260]  ban openly is infowars.com. At a backup site, prisonplanet.com, we'll be
[07:35.260 --> 07:38.500]  launching some new big investigative journal sites here in the next few months
[07:38.500 --> 07:39.340]  as well.
[07:46.340 --> 07:50.820]  It's a paradox. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. A tale of
[07:50.820 --> 07:51.620]  two cities.
[07:56.940 --> 07:57.660]  One word.
[07:58.940 --> 08:00.220]  Domestication.
[08:02.380 --> 08:04.460]  Domestication is not good.
[08:04.460 --> 08:06.860]  For anybody.
[08:08.300 --> 08:12.940]  And there's no doubt that civilization itself has had a lot of really amazing
[08:12.940 --> 08:14.780]  positive attributes to it.
[08:16.900 --> 08:20.380]  But at the same time, it has allowed people to live in fantasy lands.
[08:22.460 --> 08:27.620]  And to be very, very decadent and very, very slovenly and very, very sloth like
[08:27.620 --> 08:35.460]  and very, very entitled and to then be recruited as big giant masses of dumb
[08:35.460 --> 08:42.860]  down drooling fools by criminal intellectuals who forge them into
[08:42.860 --> 08:44.460]  giant lemming armies.
[08:48.820 --> 08:56.460]  You know, good, loving, strong people tend to look at ugly, stupid people, sadly.
[08:56.460 --> 08:59.500]  And you try to build them up and you try to love them and you try to empower
[08:59.500 --> 09:03.980]  them. But see, remember, it's the stupid and the fallen that are normally the
[09:03.980 --> 09:04.700]  most evil.
[09:06.580 --> 09:10.980]  And so you're trying to be nice to them, but they're like bug-eyed, lobotomized
[09:11.420 --> 09:12.300]  piranhas.
[09:17.820 --> 09:23.700]  And they just can't handle the power of technology. They can't handle the power
[09:23.700 --> 09:28.500]  of all this enlightenment. And there's water, water everywhere, not a drop to
[09:28.500 --> 09:33.420]  drink. They have the knowledge of the ages at their fingertips and the language
[09:33.420 --> 09:37.980]  is smaller. The IQs are dropping. That's physical degradation.
[09:38.500 --> 09:43.780]  Society, when I go out in public, I don't care what part of Austin or what part
[09:43.780 --> 09:48.460]  of the country, people look like retarded zombies everywhere.
[09:48.460 --> 09:54.780]  I literally see more light in down syndrome children's eyes. There's somehow
[09:54.780 --> 10:00.020]  like immune to it than I see in the average person's eyes. I'm serious.
[10:01.620 --> 10:07.420]  Kids with down syndrome are like gods compared to the average person because
[10:07.420 --> 10:11.220]  somehow they're not susceptible to like the demonic transmission or whatever's
[10:11.220 --> 10:14.540]  happening, but people are so screwed up.
[10:14.540 --> 10:19.780]  I was in a peteria today with my son after I went on a hike, I saw local chain
[10:19.780 --> 10:25.020]  hamburger place and it was in Westlake in the fancy area town and I was in
[10:25.020 --> 10:29.060]  there looking and we were there for like an hour. We went ahead, just took our time
[10:29.060 --> 10:32.900]  and sat there and I was listening to all the tables around me and I was watching
[10:32.900 --> 10:38.980]  people and all the wealthy liberals towards like skexies hunched over making
[10:38.980 --> 10:44.540]  cackling jokes about Donald Trump and just all looking approvingly at each other to
[10:44.540 --> 10:48.740]  is all super insecure and super stupid, but also really evil.
[10:49.340 --> 10:52.820]  I mean, they looked evil. I didn't want to go warn them or talk to me around them.
[10:52.820 --> 10:54.300]  I wanted to get away from them.
[10:56.140 --> 10:59.540]  They were really not ugly because they were old at this particular table.
[10:59.540 --> 11:03.020]  They were ugly because they think they're part of the power elite because they go
[11:03.020 --> 11:04.340]  along with the corporate media.
[11:04.340 --> 11:08.100]  And over here were some scared families and everybody's real insecure looking
[11:08.100 --> 11:11.620]  around and you know, and I'm just looking at how broken and weak people are.
[11:11.620 --> 11:15.220]  And there's a family with a couple kids in a Down syndrome and the Down syndrome
[11:15.220 --> 11:18.460]  kids like, oh happy talking and I know they have their issues, but like you can
[11:18.460 --> 11:24.060]  see so much more spirit in a mentally retarded child than the general public.
[11:24.620 --> 11:27.420]  And I'm like looking for, man, where's a good looking man?
[11:27.420 --> 11:28.540]  Where's a good looking woman?
[11:28.540 --> 11:30.500]  Man, where's a, where's a good looking woman?
[11:30.500 --> 11:34.580]  Man, where's a good looking man? Where's a good looking woman? Man, where's a,
[11:34.580 --> 11:36.460]  where's somebody dialed in? Where are they?
[11:36.460 --> 11:42.660]  And the only people I know are either my crew or like military veterans and people
[11:42.660 --> 11:45.140]  because everybody else has been turned into basically an animal.
[11:46.260 --> 11:48.020]  And I don't say that on a power trip.
[11:48.820 --> 11:52.580]  The elite sit around talking about how you're a dumb idiot and all the stuff
[11:52.580 --> 11:55.060]  they've already done to you with the fluoride, but it's more the fluoride
[11:55.060 --> 11:56.580]  than the glyphosate and the GMO.
[11:56.580 --> 12:05.380]  It's the culture. It's a spirit. It's a spirit of, of just jealousy and envy
[12:05.380 --> 12:11.620]  and weakness and being spoiled rotten and hating success and just being nasty
[12:11.620 --> 12:18.020]  and, and, and just laughing at everybody and, and just, just delusional power trip
[12:18.020 --> 12:23.300]  that you're an elite when you're not. And I sat there and I looked at the lines
[12:23.300 --> 12:26.420]  of cars pulling through there and I looked at people at the shopping center
[12:26.420 --> 12:29.300]  and I, and I just looked at it and everybody was angry and everybody was
[12:29.300 --> 12:32.900]  pissed and nobody even appreciated all this great things they had and all this
[12:32.900 --> 12:37.220]  technology and all this instant food and all this instant medicine and I just
[12:37.220 --> 12:39.460]  looked at almost everybody's faces and people weren't happy.
[12:40.100 --> 12:44.260]  They, they had, they had had their birthright and the fact that being a good
[12:44.260 --> 12:49.860]  strong person is who you are. They've all been taught that they weren't
[12:49.860 --> 12:54.900]  adequate. They didn't have power. They were nobodies by Madison Avenue and
[12:54.900 --> 12:58.100]  Wall Street and the corporate media and once they get you being insecure when
[12:58.100 --> 13:02.020]  you're a child, they then go, it's okay. We won't make you insecure anymore.
[13:02.020 --> 13:07.220]  Adopt our belief systems and adopt a hive mind and then we'll give you a false
[13:08.500 --> 13:13.620]  narrative that somehow now you're in charge and powerful because you're out enforcing
[13:13.620 --> 13:23.700]  a delusional, fraudulent, anti-common sense system.
[13:25.380 --> 13:30.740]  I mean, I got to be honest with you. It really freaked me out and again, I don't
[13:30.740 --> 13:34.100]  sit here and talk about these people from some position of I'm the most beautiful
[13:34.100 --> 13:38.500]  person or oh, I'm so great. I'm so wonderful. It's the opposite. I'm, I have to
[13:38.500 --> 13:46.100]  assess the reality that we've had it so good so long. It's the paradox that you
[13:46.100 --> 13:51.780]  become monsters. Prosperity makes monsters. Adversity makes men.
[13:55.540 --> 14:00.100]  And every metric shows it on off the chart, depression off the chart, cancer
[14:00.100 --> 14:04.660]  off the chart, obesity off the chart, everything bad. And then you look at the
[14:04.660 --> 14:10.340]  controllers who know all this and they're trying to make it worse because I used
[14:10.340 --> 14:12.820]  to think it was because their own white people said this that they were doing
[14:12.820 --> 14:15.540]  all this because they were in competition with thinkers. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[14:16.420 --> 14:21.380]  They just want to extinguish thinkers because it's like a big bright light in a room of
[14:21.380 --> 14:29.060]  empires. They don't like it. And I, it's like some type of interdimensional
[14:29.060 --> 14:35.300]  blight or succubus has like attached itself to the people and it's like either
[14:35.300 --> 14:37.220]  they're demon possessed or they aren't.
[14:40.100 --> 14:44.100]  And that's what it is. I've talked to a lot of top psychologists, a lot of top
[14:44.100 --> 14:48.500]  PhDs or even atheists and they said, listen, you study enough, you look enough,
[14:48.500 --> 14:52.820]  you get into situations enough, you'll run into people that are clearly possessed
[14:52.820 --> 14:56.180]  and who even know information about you. You've never told them and they're not
[14:56.180 --> 14:59.860]  guessing. Something else is coming through them. And folks, that's what this is.
[15:00.420 --> 15:03.380]  I don't care if the media makes fun of me. I don't care what they say, whatever.
[15:03.380 --> 15:08.420]  I'm telling you, folks, I look out at the crowds. I see the people, they are possessed by
[15:08.420 --> 15:12.980]  something. I don't know what it is. You know, most of the planet believes in demons and
[15:12.980 --> 15:18.740]  possession for a reason. In fact, every culture does because it's not dimmed. Something's
[15:18.740 --> 15:24.260]  coming in. Something's been overlaid and it's a sickness and it's spreading and the
[15:24.260 --> 15:28.100]  television is the vector. It's how they're getting through it, people.
[15:29.380 --> 15:34.420]  It's a mind trick. They put them into a subconscious hypnosis. They admit that through
[15:34.420 --> 15:38.660]  the television flicker rates, the lights, all of it. And then they superimpose something
[15:38.660 --> 15:43.620]  until they get your free will through incrementalism to turn yourself over to it.
[15:44.180 --> 15:50.580]  And then it's like a intergalactic virus that then causes the individual to shut down,
[15:50.580 --> 15:55.860]  become a poisonous creature who begins attacking everything around them. It's a wavelength.
[15:58.180 --> 16:03.300]  This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best
[16:03.300 --> 16:08.180]  new off-the-grid products of 2017. And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[16:08.180 --> 16:12.420]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science,

[17:58.260 --> 18:04.260]  We have the new product at InfowarsLife.com, Biotru Selenium. We've had so many requests
[18:04.260 --> 18:10.260]  over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic
[18:10.260 --> 18:15.620]  bioavailable selenium from Mustard Seed Extract. When you take selenium in the body,
[18:15.620 --> 18:21.460]  it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body. It helps balance the thyroid gland,
[18:21.460 --> 18:27.380]  it helps detoxify. Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves. The highest concentration
[18:27.380 --> 18:31.220]  of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body. As a matter
[18:31.220 --> 18:38.020]  of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium, so it really
[18:38.020 --> 18:45.140]  is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs. I'm taking it now every day. This is Soki.
[18:45.140 --> 18:50.260]  Biotru Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring. We believe it's the best
[18:50.260 --> 18:54.580]  out there at a very, very low price. Exclusively available at InfowarsLife.com, or by calling

[20:22.580 --> 20:26.900]  Broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:26.900 --> 20:31.940]  And my mighty crew in here on Sunday. All right, I just got into the whole metaphysical,
[20:31.940 --> 20:36.100]  but you can look at every scientific metric, and humanity is half-dead.
[20:37.700 --> 20:45.380]  Humanity is dying, and every western country is particularly under attack. Every measurement,
[20:45.380 --> 20:51.300]  every bellwether, every gauge. Brazil had one of the lowest breast cancer rates in the world.
[20:51.300 --> 20:55.700]  20 years after life of states were introduced, it's just off the chart. I mean, we know what's
[20:55.700 --> 21:01.940]  going on. We are a poisoned society, a poisoned culture, and the poisons are being protected.
[21:03.140 --> 21:06.580]  And then things that aren't poisonous, like carbon dioxide, that plants need,
[21:06.580 --> 21:11.300]  and the earth is in a starved carbon dioxide system. That's undebatable.
[21:12.100 --> 21:15.460]  They believe Mars lost its atmosphere because it started losing carbon dioxide.
[21:16.420 --> 21:20.980]  We're losing our atmosphere right now. You can go look that up. This isn't the pop science stuff
[21:20.980 --> 21:26.500]  you see in the Newsweek or Time Magazine, but real scientists and climatologists and
[21:27.700 --> 21:31.220]  people that study deserts expanding and all that will tell you we're the lowest carbon
[21:31.220 --> 21:36.180]  dioxide level ever in the planet's history. Carbon dioxide's been hundreds of times higher.
[21:39.380 --> 21:44.740]  Plankton levels have been 50 times, 60 times higher. Just everything. Plants have been three
[21:44.740 --> 21:50.580]  times taller, growing four or five times faster. We're losing our atmosphere. And that's what I
[21:50.580 --> 21:56.340]  mean. It's like I'm informed. I know all the incontrovertible facts. I don't mean all of them.
[21:56.340 --> 22:00.660]  I mean, compared to the average person, it's frightening how they don't know anything.
[22:04.500 --> 22:08.660]  And it's like they don't want us to have an atmosphere. Who is running the show?
[22:09.540 --> 22:14.500]  And it's crazy that we would become industrialized right at the point and start pumping the oil up
[22:14.500 --> 22:19.700]  out of the earth that was formed back when there was so much more life on the planet,
[22:19.700 --> 22:27.220]  such a more versatile fauna or just overall larger mega mass of life that that would then
[22:27.220 --> 22:31.940]  give us an atmosphere to where right when our atmosphere started running out, humanity hit
[22:31.940 --> 22:37.460]  this crest point to then be able to bring back all the ancient carbon held in the earth and
[22:37.460 --> 22:41.380]  stabilize the atmosphere. That's the real geoengineering terraforming.
[22:44.020 --> 22:47.940]  Who doesn't want us to have an atmosphere? Check that out. I mean, that's what I mean.
[22:47.940 --> 22:51.940]  One little piece of info like that could be what the whole show is about.
[22:54.020 --> 22:56.980]  Here's an example. I was hiking with some friends today with my son
[22:58.020 --> 23:03.060]  and they were saying, Alex, are you part of the 1%? And I said, yeah, but you can make,
[23:03.060 --> 23:06.500]  you know, a couple hundred thousand dollars a year and be in the 1%. And they're like,
[23:06.500 --> 23:13.220]  what do you mean? I'll let you know. No, no, it's, we did the math a few years ago, but it's 0.000000
[23:13.220 --> 23:22.020]  0.042. CJ's done it before. If you equate who actually has the money in the 1%, it's the,
[23:22.020 --> 23:28.420]  it's not even like 1% of the 1%. It's 0.000000 way out because
[23:30.820 --> 23:34.900]  it's 11 zeros. It's 11 zeros. Were you on air just now? Yeah. You've done the math. We did it
[23:34.900 --> 23:40.100]  a few times. We should do a whole video on this because, because people literally go kill the
[23:40.100 --> 23:46.900]  1%, that's who hires people and, and, and starts businesses. The real elite want a post human
[23:46.900 --> 23:51.380]  world folks. They, they believe that it's like Zuckerberg shows up in Kauai, one of the most
[23:51.380 --> 23:58.260]  beautiful places in the world. The further most isolated island on the planet where they film
[23:58.260 --> 24:04.100]  the Jurassic parks, King Kong, everything. Okay. Most beautiful place on earth. And I've been there.
[24:04.100 --> 24:12.420]  It's just nothing compares. And the Zuckerberg shows up and almost the whole islands owned by
[24:12.420 --> 24:16.020]  the people there because they haven't been selling it in over a hundred years and a few ranchers that,
[24:16.020 --> 24:20.180]  you know, came in mainly Protestant missionaries hundreds of years ago and got some land.
[24:21.540 --> 24:25.700]  Zuckerberg just comes in, buys some government owned land and then tries to take everybody
[24:25.700 --> 24:32.820]  else's land around him. It's the whole mindset of these people. He's so disconnected from reality
[24:32.820 --> 24:36.500]  that he just thinks you should just get the hell off the island. You've been on for thousands of
[24:36.500 --> 24:43.860]  years. This is the mindset. So these eight billionaires have as much money as the world's 3.6 billion
[24:43.860 --> 24:49.380]  poorest people. That's from Oxfam. And who are they? They're all the top globalists like Bill Gates
[24:49.380 --> 24:53.940]  and Warren Buffett who put their money in tax-free foundations. They don't pay taxes. And then the
[24:53.940 --> 24:58.500]  news they own tells you they're philanthropists. No, they're not. They're eugenicist monsters.
[24:58.500 --> 25:06.900]  That's not my opinion. That's a fact. But what am I getting at here? They're playing class envy
[25:08.500 --> 25:12.340]  against the middle class and against the 2 percent and the 1 percent when
[25:13.380 --> 25:18.180]  if the top 1 percent has 60 percent of the world's wealth, some estimates are up to 70,
[25:18.820 --> 25:25.380]  the big lie is it's the 11 zeros for two that has almost all of that.
[25:25.380 --> 25:31.780]  So understand folks, what I'm getting in here is when you go to Bill Gates and all the rest
[25:31.780 --> 25:36.180]  of these guys, Carlos Slim, all of them and the top Japanese families and the Chinese families
[25:36.180 --> 25:42.420]  and others and the Rothschilds, they literally to a person are setting up a world government.
[25:42.420 --> 25:46.500]  They're all tax exempt. They don't pay taxes. They're the ones that want your guns. They're
[25:46.500 --> 25:50.020]  the ones that want to force inoculations on you. They're the ones that are running a whole
[25:50.020 --> 25:56.020]  life estate program. And then it turns out they're all admittedly eugenicists that meet in secret
[25:56.020 --> 26:01.220]  to discuss ways to forcibly inoculate you to sterilize you. They say, well, look at the third
[26:01.220 --> 26:05.700]  world, we should sterilize them. You know, you have that view. But then they learn they're actually
[26:05.700 --> 26:12.260]  targeting higher educated families and people and that they actually don't want any competition.
[26:12.260 --> 26:20.420]  It's total, complete, cold-blooded, willful, selfish domination of not just humans. They want
[26:20.420 --> 26:26.100]  to clone and patent every plant, every animal, every bacteria and are just playing God. And
[26:26.100 --> 26:31.620]  they're in a psycho race for life extension. Selfishly not caring if they destroy the whole
[26:31.620 --> 26:35.540]  planet because in their own words, you know, read their quotes, they say, we don't care.
[26:35.540 --> 26:39.220]  Because if we die, it doesn't matter. We may just blow the planet up.
[26:39.220 --> 26:44.260]  They even have writings where they go. And once it gets down to just a hundred of us,
[26:44.260 --> 26:50.580]  we're going to have battle till there's one. We're going to kill everybody but one person
[26:50.580 --> 26:56.020]  that merges with machines and becomes Lucifer. They don't even believe in Lucifer. They're so
[26:56.020 --> 27:03.540]  arrogant. They believe they are Lucifer, the morning sun, the new star. 2001. I mean, it's
[27:03.540 --> 27:09.780]  whether, whether it's real, whether they're being given all this, you know, information through the
[27:09.780 --> 27:15.940]  veil, you know, interdimensional communication. That's what they believe they're getting.
[27:15.940 --> 27:22.180]  These people are here to kill us. And then I go and I sit there and I hear people, all these,
[27:23.780 --> 27:28.900]  he wasn't the liberals sitting around me were ugly physically. They all were just like skexies
[27:28.900 --> 27:37.060]  from the dark crystal. Like, did you see, did you see these show last night? Yes, I did. And
[27:37.060 --> 27:44.260]  it was so good to see them on Saturday Night Live exposing Spitzer. Yeah, good. And they would all
[27:44.260 --> 27:49.540]  just like say a few words to each other and go, and then just celebrate. Yeah, we're winners.
[27:50.900 --> 27:55.940]  We parrot what the mainstream media says. And I was just like, oh, and I heard another table,
[27:55.940 --> 28:00.900]  you know, like gibbering just, I mean, almost no one washes it, but them and it's all crap,
[28:00.900 --> 28:06.900]  and it's no good. And it's all fake, but it's extruded out to people that just want to imagine
[28:06.900 --> 28:12.340]  their winners. They don't care about themselves, their families, anybody around them, but they
[28:12.340 --> 28:18.740]  tell you all day how much they love you and how they want to take care of you. When I come back,
[28:18.740 --> 28:26.820]  I'm getting into all the big news because it's, it's just huge. This news is so big that I sat
[28:26.820 --> 28:31.380]  here for hours before the show. And I don't even know how to even cover this because if I don't
[28:31.380 --> 28:37.460]  cover it, I mean, shall I light my hair on fire? Because I mean, this is the occasion to do that.
[28:37.460 --> 28:44.340]  Running on the street naked. I mean, it's so incredible in history, so over the top, so unprecedented,
[28:44.340 --> 28:51.380]  so criminal. I don't even know how to describe it, but we'll try when we come back. I'm Alex Jones,
[28:51.380 --> 28:55.140]  this is the info war. They want to censor the site, spread it, you're beating them right now,
[28:55.140 --> 29:00.020]  and to cover that too, you're beating the algorithm. First, Trump submits a temporary travel ban,
[29:00.020 --> 29:04.900]  something legal and lawful, done in the past, based off Obama's list. Then the Democrats and
[29:04.900 --> 29:10.500]  media spin it, protests ensue nationwide, judges block it, and Trump tweets, see you in court.
[29:10.500 --> 29:15.700]  Meanwhile, Steve Jern, a US Marine working in Iraq, posts a viral video explaining to people
[29:15.700 --> 29:20.420]  that if an American walks out on the streets in Iraq, he'd be scooped up and tortured. Then,
[29:20.420 --> 29:25.380]  15 hours later, after that video gets viewed millions of times, he gets blocked on Facebook
[29:25.380 --> 29:31.460]  and is evacuated out of Iraq and sent back to America. Now, hundreds of thousands of Iranians
[29:31.460 --> 29:36.180]  are rallying in the streets, carrying signs and chanting death to America, while a military
[29:36.180 --> 29:41.380]  police band plays revolutionary music, getting hyped up over their enemy. Us, let's not forget,
[29:41.380 --> 29:46.340]  terrorists have been taking advantage of refugee programs for years, and Assad has just said there
[29:46.340 --> 29:51.780]  are terrorists within the refugees. Are these judges not treasonous? You still want to protest
[29:51.780 --> 29:56.740]  the travel ban? This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com. You can't script this.
[29:58.740 --> 30:05.220]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense,
[30:05.220 --> 30:12.980]  probiotic. We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality, known probiotics that

[30:54.100 --> 30:58.900]  support your own health and support the info war. Hey everyone,
[30:58.900 --> 31:03.300]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help

[31:08.180 --> 31:13.460]  of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country. Obesity,
[31:13.460 --> 31:18.340]  diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four
[31:18.340 --> 31:22.100]  people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person
[31:22.100 --> 31:26.100]  with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and
[31:26.100 --> 31:30.660]  want to maintain your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient easy way to incorporate

[32:30.420 --> 32:36.020]  thousand toddler beers. When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage,
[32:36.020 --> 32:43.380]  mom and apple pie. And beef was for supper, revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical
[32:43.380 --> 32:49.700]  screenings on demand, DVDs now available, starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, special ops general,
[32:49.700 --> 32:56.580]  Jerry Boykin. Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue? Revelation, the movie.info.
[32:56.580 --> 32:57.460]  Let's fix it.
[33:02.100 --> 33:04.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:04.820 --> 33:18.900]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[33:20.340 --> 33:26.980]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[33:26.980 --> 33:31.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:36.980 --> 33:41.460]  Allie was making the point, one of the producers, that we look at reality now through
[33:42.500 --> 33:48.180]  a gatekeeper, through a template, through an electric eye. And she was pointing out that
[33:48.180 --> 33:56.100]  a great way to see that is, photos from the 1990s at concerts were people just raising their arms,
[33:56.100 --> 34:00.020]  dancing, having a good time. But now almost everyone's holding up a smartphone,
[34:01.620 --> 34:06.500]  videotaping it or digitally taping it and recording it. And they're actually watching
[34:06.500 --> 34:10.980]  the performance through the recording. And look, I was there right in front of Trump getting sworn
[34:10.980 --> 34:16.420]  in, and I videotaped it too. It was historical. But the point is, is that we should recognize that
[34:17.460 --> 34:21.780]  the globalist can then, through those machines, through those Trojan horses, take control of
[34:21.780 --> 34:27.220]  what we're seeing once we give ourselves over to the digital system completely. So I'm a
[34:27.220 --> 34:31.380]  biggest hypocrite as anybody about all this. I'm not up here, again, on a high horse saying,
[34:31.380 --> 34:36.260]  I have all the answers. I know because I've experienced giving over my will to the system.
[34:36.820 --> 34:41.940]  I've seen my consciousness slipping away. And I'm only now beginning to regain it.
[34:44.100 --> 34:51.300]  Five years ago, I was shell shocked by fighting the globalist. I was going home and retreating
[34:51.300 --> 34:57.620]  into Gilligan's Island, DVDs, and I dream of Jeannie and just escapism from the 1960s.
[35:00.260 --> 35:06.740]  Because I just let the system get me down to where I just kept believing I'll put the word out,
[35:06.740 --> 35:10.900]  other men better than me will rise up and defeat it. I'll get the word out. Then I realized, well,
[35:10.900 --> 35:14.180]  there's not going to be a bunch of other guys probably right now better than you. You've got
[35:14.180 --> 35:18.180]  to go all the way, Jones. You got to lose weight. You got to focus. You got to dominate. You got
[35:18.180 --> 35:21.860]  to work even harder again. And of course, I've done that years before. It's just that
[35:25.220 --> 35:31.620]  there's so much they're doing and it's so well documented. It's so obvious. And I care about
[35:31.620 --> 35:37.620]  the people that believe all this BS. I don't want to work like the globalist against them because
[35:37.620 --> 35:44.020]  they are blind. But then they're dangerous and hateful too, even though I'm trying to save them.
[35:44.020 --> 35:49.300]  And it's not my opinion that the new world order wants to make you poor. They constantly admit it.
[35:49.300 --> 35:55.060]  It's not my opinion. They want to hurt you. It's not my opinion. They want to kill you slowly and
[35:55.060 --> 36:03.460]  suck all the money out of you. It's not my opinion that most of these major institutions are run by
[36:03.460 --> 36:12.020]  pedophiles. That's why the intelligence agency heads listen to me all over the world. That's why
[36:12.020 --> 36:16.820]  world leaders do. Because this is the only place you can tune in and hear somebody talk about what
[36:16.820 --> 36:21.780]  people in the no-no, that's why Trump keeps saying, well, now that I'm president, I know a lot more
[36:21.780 --> 36:27.780]  and I just really want to help people. I hope people wake up and realize he's so resigned now to
[36:27.780 --> 36:32.820]  his fate and that he now knows he's just got to walk through the motions for his soul.
[36:32.820 --> 36:47.140]  God almighty. If people in the trance would just awaken, if the sleeper would just awaken, we could
[36:47.140 --> 36:53.540]  turn this around so fast. Don't fear he that can kill your body. Fear he that can steal your soul
[36:53.540 --> 37:03.060]  because you can willingly give your soul over your essence to this vacuum cleaner that is globalism
[37:03.060 --> 37:10.820]  and it comes to get your soul. Like the Bible says, in the end days, the great sorcerers of the earth
[37:10.820 --> 37:17.620]  trafficked in men and women's souls. I forget what techno band does it, but there's one from the 80s
[37:17.620 --> 37:21.620]  that goes, we want your soul. We got to try to find that and play at the start of the next segment.
[37:21.620 --> 37:30.100]  I mean, that's it and I'm here in the artificial system that's been created even reaching out to you
[37:30.100 --> 37:40.340]  right now through this poisoned medium. I mean, I know this, we are living in the most incredible
[37:40.340 --> 37:46.980]  time ever. This is beyond a science fiction movie. This is a dystopic novel if it ends one way,
[37:46.980 --> 37:53.060]  a utopia novel that ends the other, but this is an incredible quest on a planet with all this
[37:53.060 --> 37:59.140]  technology and all these mysteries and men and women and families and children and just everything
[37:59.140 --> 38:06.340]  is so fantastical and just the things humans go through and then I think how dare the system
[38:07.700 --> 38:13.540]  try to get in between men and women and children and families and the species. It's so alien. It's
[38:13.540 --> 38:19.780]  so artificial. It's so creepy. It's so hateful. Where is the common sense to see what mainstream
[38:19.780 --> 38:26.580]  media pushes and what it does is pure evil and then to see the entire power structure
[38:26.580 --> 38:34.180]  desperately throwing everything it's got against Trump. And I was on my Facebook this morning and
[38:34.180 --> 38:38.580]  I saw in one of the posts people going, oh, look, he appointed three Goldman Sachs people. He sold
[38:38.580 --> 38:45.540]  out and in a raid on a terrorist compound, a kid got killed by accident. But the Muslims are good
[38:45.540 --> 38:52.420]  blowing up their kids on purpose. They've been under political bondage so long and spiritual
[38:52.420 --> 38:59.780]  bondage. They just don't know. I love them too. But I love people walking down the street and they go.
[39:02.180 --> 39:06.820]  They go, oh, Alex, I used to like you, but are you proud of your Goldman Sachs president?
[39:06.820 --> 39:16.820]  Donald Trump is dynamiting the entire globalist Goldman Sachs agenda of TPP open borders,
[39:16.820 --> 39:22.340]  ending the family, bankrupting the nation state, everything. He judge a tree by its roots. Of
[39:22.340 --> 39:27.540]  course he went and got three top people who'd been on the inside who have consciences and are
[39:27.540 --> 39:33.700]  totally freaked out and want to try to defeat this. We want people from the cult to come out
[39:33.700 --> 39:39.860]  and tell us how it works to blow the damn thing up. We want imperials that were on the enemy side
[39:39.860 --> 39:46.420]  to come give us the Death Star plans, dumbasses. Donald Trump is blowing the hell out of them
[39:46.420 --> 39:52.100]  on a suicide mission. I know for a fact they're trying to remove his head of security right now
[39:52.100 --> 39:58.100]  and they are getting lined up to try to kill the president right now from multiple sources today.
[39:58.100 --> 40:06.420]  And the evil side of me says the public does not deserve Donald Trump. This is some
[40:06.420 --> 40:10.980]  ass-kissing contest because he's the president and some guy with a hot wife and I give a damn
[40:10.980 --> 40:18.340]  about money. Everything he's doing is diametrically. It's so good what he's doing that it's spiritual.
[40:18.340 --> 40:23.060]  There's no way people are directing this. This counterattack, just like the enemy,
[40:23.060 --> 40:29.060]  there's no way that's human. It's so sophisticated. This counterattack against them is so good. Come
[40:29.060 --> 40:35.460]  straight from God. That's why the enemy is just because they thought they had us. They thought
[40:35.460 --> 40:39.620]  they had us. They thought they could suck our energy out. They thought they were going to crush
[40:39.620 --> 40:44.260]  us. They thought they were going to get all our souls and get our kids and give us all cancer
[40:44.260 --> 40:49.860]  and piss on us and inject us all with their crap. And now it's all blowing up in their face and they
[40:49.860 --> 40:56.820]  are screaming like demons. What is the big news? I'm not building this up to have you keep listening.
[40:56.820 --> 41:01.700]  I just can't even get to it. It's so huge. We're going to go to break. I'm going to come back and
[41:01.700 --> 41:12.740]  I'm going to cover it directly. I'm going to be as good a boy as I can here. But I just wish
[41:12.740 --> 41:18.740]  people knew how hard people are fighting for you even though they know you don't appreciate it and
[41:18.740 --> 41:23.860]  don't want it. And they're going to try to start a revolution in this country with all the dumb
[41:23.860 --> 41:27.620]  down scum and all the rest of them that have been told to live in their basements but are now told
[41:27.620 --> 41:32.580]  to come out like hordes of goblins, you know, and just attack everything. They're like, oh,
[41:32.580 --> 41:36.180]  you never had your humanity. Go and go attack now. See, they've been pinning it up. Now they're
[41:36.180 --> 41:44.340]  going to try to release it. And the patriots have to focus. Get on their knees before God pray
[41:44.340 --> 41:50.420]  and go out and street preach liberty. The Bill of Rights, the Constitution, what made America great.
[41:52.420 --> 41:55.300]  Why everybody wants to come here
[41:57.860 --> 42:03.380]  and explain not that we're perfect. God knows we're bad, but because there was a spirit, an idea
[42:03.380 --> 42:08.260]  that was different than everywhere else. Again, they always tell us how bad we are and the bad
[42:08.260 --> 42:12.020]  things we've done. The bad things our ancestors have done because they know we're good and have
[42:12.020 --> 42:18.180]  a conscience. It's a big joke to these vampires, these spiritual vampires that when we get told
[42:18.180 --> 42:22.020]  we've done bad, we have a conscience. We're like, yes, yes, but they're like intercessing themselves
[42:22.020 --> 42:28.020]  between God and us acting like they're God telling us how we are bad and how we're not good and how
[42:28.020 --> 42:32.900]  we're not worthy. We have to get them out of the way and then get God's message directly to us.
[42:32.900 --> 42:40.500]  And God's going to say, you love justice. Stop letting them even have you doubts. Go out and
[42:40.500 --> 42:45.380]  stand up to the innocence. Take action. You get a real transmission from God. It's not going to
[42:45.380 --> 42:51.380]  be a bunch of this new old order crap. Believe that. And they know that God's spirit is coming
[42:51.380 --> 43:11.380]  back into the world. They can feel it. Just pray for God's spirit to be poured out.
[43:21.700 --> 43:26.980]  We've brought out a lot of amazing products like survival shield X to super male vitality and so
[43:26.980 --> 43:32.260]  many others with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for

[43:38.180 --> 43:44.340]  this part is most important. The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived
[43:44.340 --> 43:49.540]  or of the highest quality lab standard. That means it's clean. That means it's pure and
[43:49.540 --> 43:53.700]  rest secured. You're finding the tip of the spear in the info war. That's infowarslife.com

[43:58.820 --> 44:03.220]  filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially
[44:03.220 --> 44:09.620]  for our children. The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune
[44:09.620 --> 44:15.220]  systems. The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[44:15.220 --> 44:20.660]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze. Whether it's your home or office,

[44:30.900 --> 44:35.940]  things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't.
[44:37.060 --> 44:42.980]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800
[44:42.980 --> 44:47.220]  square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house

[47:20.340 --> 47:24.980]  from enemies born and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[47:38.980 --> 47:43.060]  Give the digital computer your mind. Let it learn to be alive.
[47:43.060 --> 47:57.140]  As it grows, they live. Be sleep. Sleeper awaken. Who could deny?
[48:01.460 --> 48:08.660]  Have your own spirit. That's God and your spirit communes with God.
[48:08.660 --> 48:14.420]  You dial into the enemy, you give up your spirit and they overwrite you. You join them
[48:15.540 --> 48:22.340]  and you live the delusional land of slavery. All right, let me get into the huge news here
[48:22.340 --> 48:30.660]  and then we'll do it right into the next hour. I was intending to come in here today and break
[48:30.660 --> 48:35.460]  this down and then I saw a New York post article that actually got it right because it's very
[48:35.460 --> 48:39.860]  frustrating. I don't want to be territorialized here and go, oh, look, I'm the one that gets it.
[48:39.860 --> 48:46.020]  How wonderful and we're losing. It's good to see other people in prominent publications getting it.
[48:48.420 --> 48:50.180]  Paul Sperry. I'm going to get Paul Sperry on.
[48:55.220 --> 48:59.620]  It's unprecedented in U.S. history to have the type of court ruling we saw to the Night
[48:59.620 --> 49:04.500]  Surgeon when the law was explicitly clear, undebatable, even liberals at the Justice Department
[49:04.500 --> 49:10.020]  admitted that this is just crazy revolt. But then you learn that the Justice Department
[49:12.180 --> 49:18.980]  along with the State Department are just completely ignoring President Trump and Rex
[49:18.980 --> 49:24.020]  Tillerson and are putting out reports saying the president is a Russian agent basically
[49:24.660 --> 49:30.020]  and that LePen is a Russian agent with no proof because she's a nationalist and by the way a
[49:30.020 --> 49:35.140]  free marketer and all the rest of it. That's a Russian spy giving them to me all day. No, no,
[49:35.140 --> 49:38.500]  no, the Russians have pulled out of globalism. We're pulling out the whole world's pulling out
[49:38.500 --> 49:42.820]  because it's known that it's a giant screw job and the State Department came out on Friday and
[49:42.820 --> 49:48.340]  said we're launching a major operation in France to make sure the nationalist party loses.
[49:51.860 --> 49:55.620]  Same thing in Italy. They're trying to say, oh, the Italians didn't want the EU to have
[49:55.620 --> 50:00.340]  dictatorial power over them and voted that down two months ago because the Russians.
[50:02.020 --> 50:05.620]  Oh, and Iceland five years ago pulled out because of the Russians.
[50:06.820 --> 50:10.100]  No, the Russians pulled out for the same reason. We're pulling out.
[50:11.940 --> 50:17.140]  The New World Order is anti-capitalism, anti-free market, anti-prosperity. We're done.
[50:19.380 --> 50:22.980]  And the big news is that our media and our culture and our people
[50:22.980 --> 50:28.020]  see the communist Chinese in major newspapers everywhere saying, get your media in line,
[50:28.020 --> 50:32.980]  ban fake news. We're working with Apple. The communist Chinese are in the news to shut down
[50:32.980 --> 50:38.740]  news in China. We can do it here. You should be like, that's incredible. Apple working with China
[50:38.740 --> 50:43.220]  to censor people and arrest dissidents that are just Buddhist practitioners and killing them. And
[50:43.220 --> 50:48.180]  my God, Apple stopped tank 90% today until they backed off that. No, it's just like,
[50:48.180 --> 50:51.460]  and like, we're going to help censor in America. Thank you, China, for the help
[50:51.460 --> 50:56.740]  getting our people in line. I mean, that's like, whoa. Imagine a Hollywood movie where the
[50:56.740 --> 51:02.580]  communist Chinese are going to censor America or they're buying Hollywood. And it's just thousands
[51:02.580 --> 51:08.740]  of things like that. It's a total takeover. And then Trump is completely surrounded.
[51:08.740 --> 51:11.860]  He's got bad people in his own administration because he had to have folks that do not have the
[51:11.860 --> 51:18.180]  government run like previous. And you've got all this Paul Ryan getting money from Soros and
[51:18.180 --> 51:22.660]  trying to sell us out, trying to keep Obamacare, trying to stop tax cuts, trying to tank the economy,
[51:22.660 --> 51:25.540]  trying to sabotage the country. And it's all clear cut.
[51:30.900 --> 51:34.420]  And then I look at people that have no idea what's even going on. And I just think, do they even
[51:34.420 --> 51:38.580]  deserve someone going to bat for them and risking their life? And you know what they do?
[51:39.620 --> 51:43.300]  Because just because there's a big mass of people, a large minority of people, very color,
[51:43.300 --> 51:50.580]  every religion, who buy into the pop culture and are weak-minded people, there's a large minority
[51:51.140 --> 51:56.260]  that's awake and God-fearing and loving that has a spirit still and wants to move forward,
[51:56.260 --> 52:00.100]  despite all the attacks. And it's just going to make us stronger together of every race,
[52:00.100 --> 52:04.980]  color, and creel on the other side. We can just do this. But the evil is so strong now, I can just
[52:04.980 --> 52:10.500]  feel it because evil kind of pulled back for a while. And now it's coming in again. And the
[52:10.500 --> 52:16.260]  reason I know it is, instinctively in a spiritual level, like the fount of my energy is just like
[52:17.380 --> 52:23.300]  I'm like, oh, the enemy's coming. These poor Luciferians look for power. If they were with
[52:23.300 --> 52:29.780]  God, they would get more power than they'd ever want, believe me. And I'm telling you,
[52:29.780 --> 52:33.940]  the enemy's coming in with some big plans because I can see it politically. I can feel it at a gut
[52:33.940 --> 52:40.260]  level and I can feel my discernment and my strength is just going like the levers are getting thrown
[52:40.260 --> 52:47.300]  up. And that's only because the enemy's coming in, folks. And it's the clash of good versus evil
[52:47.300 --> 52:55.060]  that is this incredible spectacle we're seeing right now. But I read this article out of the
[52:55.060 --> 53:01.220]  New York Post and it's like, finally, somebody gets it. I mean, universities are training millions
[53:01.220 --> 53:06.580]  of people to riot and burn stuff down. We have video of that, their own video. Soros is funding
[53:06.580 --> 53:11.620]  race war. They're trying to flood us with Islamists that have terrorist records that Obama was
[53:11.620 --> 53:16.260]  letting in, getting sleeper cells into the country. I mean, this is so fantastical. Who could even come
[53:16.260 --> 53:22.180]  up with this? That's why I always end up saying it's the devil off-world interdimensional because
[53:22.180 --> 53:29.700]  it's like, well, why would they want to do all this horrible stuff? And Trump solidly
[53:29.700 --> 53:39.300]  is standing in the way of it. That's why it's painful when people go, oh, Goldman Sachs,
[53:39.300 --> 53:44.820]  he has three Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs gave, listen to this fact, 100% of their presidential
[53:44.820 --> 53:53.540]  money to Hillary. That's never happened. It's usually 60-40 for the Democrats. 100%, 100%
[53:53.540 --> 53:58.740]  against Trump. But I know it's that demonic spirit of you want to be pseudo-intellectual and say,
[53:58.740 --> 54:04.820]  nobody's real and nobody's on a sellout and oh, Alex is a sellout. Because everybody knows I'm not
[54:04.820 --> 54:11.140]  the sellout. So see, you can say that I've denied Christ. You can say that I've denied God. See,
[54:11.140 --> 54:16.020]  I've served the devil. No, I don't. And I don't know the devil a lot better than you do, believe it.
[54:17.300 --> 54:20.980]  All you that seek after the devil wish you never find it, believe me.
[54:23.140 --> 54:28.020]  Because you brush up against that, you're never the same. And I see you and I know it's just so
[54:28.020 --> 54:33.860]  sick. You will not accept the truth. You will not accept the opportunity. And it's the last opportunity
[54:33.860 --> 54:39.060]  that every nation state's being given to turn back to family and humans and God and everything
[54:39.060 --> 54:45.540]  that's good and God's plan. It's your last chance just to get everybody ready in the next few decades
[54:45.540 --> 54:49.540]  before we go back under the water. And boy, we're going to get held down a long time.
[54:49.540 --> 54:54.500]  Billions are going to die. Revelations is going to be fulfilled. The frickin' beast system,
[54:54.500 --> 55:03.060]  world government plagues, the ocean dying, just nuclear war, all of you trendies, you deserve it.
[55:03.060 --> 55:07.140]  And God's going to let the devil burn your cities down.
[55:10.340 --> 55:15.940]  Trump is only, I figured it all out, a preparation to get God's people ready so they could see the
[55:15.940 --> 55:20.180]  full evil of the enemy. Because the enemy would only really show itself if it thinks it's going
[55:20.180 --> 55:26.900]  to be defeated. And so in God's great plan, this is the big gulp of air when we're in the rip current.
[55:26.900 --> 55:31.140]  Pull it up for God, just getting that air in our lugs for one second before we're going to get
[55:31.140 --> 55:36.420]  pulled down into the greatest test our species has ever faced. But on the other side of that,
[55:37.380 --> 55:41.380]  when we've been brought lower than anybody's ever been brought, God is going to intervene
[55:41.380 --> 55:46.340]  and smash these people. That's the great test and all of you need to know it.
[55:46.340 --> 55:50.260]  You know, I put the headline up yesterday knowing people would attack it.
[55:50.980 --> 55:55.620]  Donald Trump is desperately surrounded and being attacked as he tries to save humanity.
[55:55.620 --> 56:00.580]  Not saying he's trying to save humanity, but God's energy, Christ's energy. Let's put it on screen.
[56:01.220 --> 56:05.300]  Because the New World Order, once you pour, it wants you dumb, it wants you bankrupt, it wants
[56:05.300 --> 56:09.700]  you broke, it wants you destitute, it wants you panicked. Can we put the article back up? There
[56:09.700 --> 56:16.500]  it is. That's the emergency that Trump's plan to save humanity is under attack. The New World Order
[56:16.500 --> 56:23.860]  fundamentally wants you hurt, poor, stupid, dumb, broken, dead. But it wants to play with you
[56:23.860 --> 56:31.060]  and suck everything out of you before you're killed. Because you're made in the image of God.
[56:32.020 --> 56:37.620]  Look what we've built, look what we've done, what we envision we're able to do. We're fabulous,
[56:37.620 --> 56:43.060]  we're beautiful, we're amazing. And you look at photos of people just 50, 60, 70 years ago,
[56:43.060 --> 56:48.500]  or old film reels, I don't care if it's in Africa, I don't care if it's in Mexico, I don't care if
[56:48.500 --> 56:54.660]  it's in Germany, Japan, Russia, I don't care where it is. Hawaiian Islands, you name it, the people
[56:54.660 --> 56:58.900]  are on, their spirits are there, they're strong, they're honorable, they're humans, they're connected
[56:58.900 --> 57:03.620]  to their ancestors, they have the rituals, they have the will, they have the connection, they have
[57:03.620 --> 57:09.700]  the activated DNA, they are incredible, powerful creatures. You look at people now, they look
[57:09.700 --> 57:15.780]  dead, or they look all demonic with jack-o'-lantern smiles on their little mind trip Satanism,
[57:15.780 --> 57:19.940]  I'm the best, I'm the king, I'm the God, I'm gonna rule the world crap.
[57:22.180 --> 57:27.300]  So there's an open, globalist counter-offensive against nationalism in a desperate attempt,
[57:27.300 --> 57:34.340]  but know this, this is only the gasp of air before we're pulled beneath the waves again, and that
[57:34.340 --> 57:42.660]  killer squid drags us down to hell until we learn to cry out for God so strong that God returns to
[57:42.660 --> 57:51.460]  the earth and his spirit crushes Satan. Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life

[58:49.700 --> 58:54.340]  Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good? Because people are
[58:54.340 --> 59:00.020]  actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that
[59:00.020 --> 59:05.860]  I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with
[59:05.860 --> 59:11.940]  massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[59:11.940 --> 59:17.780]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on
[59:17.780 --> 59:21.380]  everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things
[59:21.380 --> 59:26.500]  that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[59:26.500 --> 59:30.900]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got
[59:30.900 --> 59:34.740]  some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense,
[59:34.740 --> 59:38.580]  infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body,
[59:38.580 --> 59:43.700]  period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group,
[59:43.700 --> 59:47.140]  from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[59:52.180 --> 59:54.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:54.820 --> 1:00:10.420]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:00:10.420 --> 1:00:23.860]  I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime. Reflecting on my past life.
[1:00:23.860 --> 1:00:33.380]  Reflecting on my past life. And it doesn't have much time.
[1:00:33.380 --> 1:00:41.700]  Because at five o'clock. Because at five o'clock. They take me to the gallows.
[1:00:41.700 --> 1:00:55.620]  Sands of time on this planet. Running low.
[1:00:55.620 --> 1:00:58.420]  Finally, come back in the next segment. This is a short segment. I'm going to really give
[1:00:58.420 --> 1:00:59.860]  it to the news. I already covered some of it.
[1:01:03.220 --> 1:01:09.380]  To thank God that you're awake. Thank God you know what's going on. Thank God you're aware
[1:01:09.380 --> 1:01:15.540]  of good and evil and care about people. That is your only possession. It is your soul and your
[1:01:15.540 --> 1:01:20.980]  relationship with God. I haven't been to some seminary. I'll just do this because I'm sitting
[1:01:20.980 --> 1:01:26.740]  there trying to use religion like Glenn Beck does. As the evil grows, I get pushed into Christ's
[1:01:26.740 --> 1:01:31.860]  arms. So strong. That's why the enemy's killing Christians everywhere. And also taking over
[1:01:31.860 --> 1:01:37.380]  Christianity to turn people off. And these big mega churches are run by horrible satanic cults.
[1:01:37.380 --> 1:01:45.540]  It's just, it's just horrible. And the persecution of the children. And the persecution of the
[1:01:45.540 --> 1:01:50.660]  innocents. I want to warn people that serve the New World Order just out of mercenary aims.
[1:01:52.260 --> 1:01:58.740]  Or out of believing you're successful because you join with this. If you really study this,
[1:01:58.740 --> 1:02:04.820]  and you experience it, you would know there's not even a debate on whether or not you should
[1:02:04.820 --> 1:02:10.180]  join with evil. And then they always play the game. They go, oh, there's pragmatism. There's
[1:02:10.180 --> 1:02:18.900]  good and bad. The world's so corrupt. What does it matter anyways? I could have 10 different big
[1:02:18.900 --> 1:02:25.940]  gold sponsors. But I will not have a gold sponsor where they sit there and say you're calling up
[1:02:25.940 --> 1:02:30.260]  to get spot gold. I don't care if it's 5% over spot. You got to transition charges and
[1:02:30.260 --> 1:02:33.780]  got to make some money. But sit there and charge people 50%. You know what it's worth.
[1:02:33.780 --> 1:02:37.540]  Whatever. I won't be involved then. And the whole radio industry, you know, calls me and,
[1:02:37.540 --> 1:02:42.100]  you know, do this every few weeks or so they'll offer. And they're like, you don't want millions
[1:02:42.100 --> 1:02:46.260]  of dollars a month. And I'm like, no, I don't want to rob banks either or molest little kids.
[1:02:46.260 --> 1:02:50.660]  You understand? I'm not going to sit here and screw people over because I don't want that done to me.
[1:02:53.460 --> 1:02:59.140]  And I've got a covenant with God. And I'm not going to piss on that.
[1:02:59.140 --> 1:03:06.420]  All you people that love evil think you're so smart. You don't know anything about it. You have no idea.
[1:03:10.660 --> 1:03:16.500]  I don't sit here on some high horse. I feel like an evil person because I have knowledge of evil.
[1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:22.020]  And even staring into it, even knowing it's secrets, it's like, it's horrible.
[1:03:23.140 --> 1:03:27.460]  It makes me want to run away to some island and just be aware, just live on some farm.
[1:03:27.460 --> 1:03:31.700]  But you know what? They're coming for everybody. They're not going to let us run away to some farm.
[1:03:31.700 --> 1:03:35.860]  And if I don't sit here and fight these people, they're going to have their way with all the people
[1:03:35.860 --> 1:03:41.220]  that are hiding out on farms. I don't blame them running with their kids. But here's the thing,
[1:03:41.220 --> 1:03:49.780]  I'm going to stand here up against these people. But it's metaphysical as they intensify their attack
[1:03:51.780 --> 1:03:56.420]  for every action. There's an equal and opposite reaction. I get the heads up view of what they're
[1:03:56.420 --> 1:04:03.700]  doing and what's happening. And it's just like, oh my God, oh my God, this many people are willing to do this.
[1:04:07.380 --> 1:04:14.900]  And I watch them celebrate their evil acts when they themselves are just, they are resonating,
[1:04:14.900 --> 1:04:20.660]  they're choosing hell and falling off an abyss. And I watch them just burning out
[1:04:20.660 --> 1:04:26.260]  as all their humanity and what their potential was as the seed in the universe is destroyed.
[1:04:26.260 --> 1:04:36.020]  You're watching the death of a free, sentient spirit. Because they have the allegories in the
[1:04:36.020 --> 1:04:41.780]  Bible and all the rest of it. But I mean, I know it's not burning hell forever. It's you burned up,
[1:04:41.780 --> 1:04:51.380]  you're gone. You've turned yourself over to oblivion. You've been overwritten. You don't
[1:04:51.380 --> 1:05:17.380]  travel on into the cosmos for communion. We'll be back.
[1:05:21.940 --> 1:05:25.620]  Don't be fooled by the suggested inner workings of this plan, which would sound good to the
[1:05:25.620 --> 1:05:30.420]  average Joe. This is merely a psychological tactic forcing the carbon tax into your subconscious so
[1:05:30.420 --> 1:05:34.900]  they can eventually ram it home. The government will never pay you any money from a carbon tax.
[1:05:34.900 --> 1:05:39.380]  This plan is a red herring. Bloomberg published a piece praising the carbon tax plan claiming it
[1:05:39.380 --> 1:05:43.540]  will save the world from climate change. Yes, the bureaucratic exchange of money will stop
[1:05:43.540 --> 1:05:47.940]  climate change. Give me a break. Really, this is a final attempt by the bought and paid for
[1:05:47.940 --> 1:05:52.500]  government to have say over who gets to make what and how much essentially burying any free
[1:05:52.500 --> 1:06:18.980]  market competition in taxes and regulations. This is Owen Schreuer for info wars.com.
[1:06:22.500 --> 1:06:39.140]  All right, I mentioned this. It's a big deal that our media is so controlled by foreign
[1:06:39.140 --> 1:06:44.340]  multinational interests that they would openly be mainlining that, oh, look, federal agencies are
[1:06:44.340 --> 1:06:49.060]  in open revolt. And we're going to bring in people from Islamic countries that are terrorists
[1:06:49.060 --> 1:06:56.020]  and have no vetting. And we're going to overturn the law outside of law. And we're all going to
[1:06:56.020 --> 1:07:00.020]  celebrate it. And then you have all the trendies running around saying open our borders to Islam
[1:07:01.140 --> 1:07:06.340]  when women wouldn't even be able to walk around the street without hoods on their heads.
[1:07:07.540 --> 1:07:14.820]  It's frustrating. And then Obama with Soros has moved in a couple blocks from the White House
[1:07:14.820 --> 1:07:21.540]  with a big compound with a bunker. And it's got a good part of the CIA and a good part of the other
[1:07:21.540 --> 1:07:27.140]  agencies. You know, it's like revisiting heaven. You've got the host of God and the host of Satan
[1:07:27.140 --> 1:07:35.220]  literally dividing themselves up for a big battle with Bloomberg and AP and Reuters and CNBC and
[1:07:35.220 --> 1:07:43.380]  Goldman Sachs leading it with JP Morgan openly trying to sabotage the economy and kill initiatives
[1:07:43.380 --> 1:07:50.500]  that actually get money to poor people in the middle class. And then you watch giant hordes of
[1:07:52.020 --> 1:07:58.500]  always ugly, twisted, snot-nosed, dumb people. I don't say that meanly. I mean, these are these
[1:07:58.500 --> 1:08:05.940]  are like the fallen scream and yell that they'll be fulfilled if their big government state can
[1:08:05.940 --> 1:08:11.460]  just pull down the Christians and teach five-year-olds how to give blowjobs. And he's all this crazy
[1:08:11.460 --> 1:08:16.980]  crap and we could abort more babies. That would fix it. And you realize there's no destination.
[1:08:16.980 --> 1:08:24.820]  They're headed towards their damn demons. And then, of course, the response to them,
[1:08:24.820 --> 1:08:28.740]  the churches have been totally overthrown and infiltrated. So read this article by
[1:08:28.740 --> 1:08:34.180]  Paul Sperry that actually gets it right. And this isn't rhetoric. This is a war.
[1:08:35.380 --> 1:08:40.260]  They're announcing the big Democrat Party Tea Party and how they're out shutting downtown
[1:08:40.260 --> 1:08:44.260]  halls of Republicans trying to bully people and bully narcissists and people that actually
[1:08:44.260 --> 1:08:50.500]  care what a bunch of brainwashed zombies think. We're not centralized. The Soros movement,
[1:08:50.500 --> 1:08:55.940]  the Liberal Tea Party, all of them are completely financed by the enemies of this country.
[1:08:55.940 --> 1:09:00.660]  The big Golden Globes, Hollywood, all of its announcing attacks, they're going to increase
[1:09:00.660 --> 1:09:05.460]  their political attacks. They believe that somehow will get their weak-minded servants
[1:09:05.460 --> 1:09:10.980]  and minions to mobilize hard enough to somehow intimidate the rest of us into submission. That's
[1:09:10.980 --> 1:09:17.860]  going to blow up in their face as well. But they're the ones with the Goldman Sachs support.
[1:09:17.860 --> 1:09:25.140]  It's Goldman Sachs that opposes Trump. But again, little dumb-down liberals, they send me the email
[1:09:25.140 --> 1:09:29.780]  of, oh, look, he appointed out of 4,000 people, three Goldman Sachs people that are known patriots
[1:09:29.780 --> 1:09:35.380]  that want to bring it down. Oh, my God, incredible. During the Cold War, we would get KGB defectors
[1:09:35.380 --> 1:09:39.220]  to help us bring down the Soviets. Oh, my God, I've never heard of that before. What matters
[1:09:39.220 --> 1:09:44.340]  is their entire agenda is being destroyed, and you don't care. You want to just celebrate that
[1:09:44.340 --> 1:09:49.540]  you've intellectually defeated me by claiming that there's no attempt to restore the Republic
[1:09:49.540 --> 1:09:54.100]  or save the economy when that's all that's happening and it's in your interest, but you're
[1:09:54.100 --> 1:09:59.940]  delusional and believe that by buying into the system, somehow you now agree with CNN,
[1:09:59.940 --> 1:10:05.700]  so you're in the power structure. And then CNN has less than a million viewers on some of its
[1:10:05.700 --> 1:10:12.820]  biggest shows. Its average show has 100,000 viewers, but you don't care because it just
[1:10:12.820 --> 1:10:18.100]  gives you the solace that you're part of the winning team. So how Obama is scheming to sabotage
[1:10:18.100 --> 1:10:24.820]  Trump's presidency. When former President Barack Obama said he was heartened by anti-Trump protests,
[1:10:24.820 --> 1:10:28.580]  though they weren't protests, they were riots attacking people. See, no one gets it,
[1:10:28.580 --> 1:10:33.300]  because it sounds too hardcore when you're facing an enemy takeover of our Republic.
[1:10:34.020 --> 1:10:37.860]  So even a writer I say gets it, doesn't get it. It should be when former President Barack
[1:10:37.860 --> 1:10:42.820]  Obama said he was heartened by anti-Trump terrorists funded by offshore megabanks, beating
[1:10:42.820 --> 1:10:46.340]  up women and burning things down nationwide in an attempt to intimidate the American people in
[1:10:46.340 --> 1:10:51.380]  the submission. He was sending a message of approval to his troops, but see, I just added
[1:10:51.380 --> 1:10:56.420]  that little part to get what's happening. Let me tell you. I'm not just saying that's my opinion,
[1:10:56.420 --> 1:11:03.220]  that's what happened. When former, let me actually read from the article, when former President
[1:11:03.220 --> 1:11:08.260]  Barack Obama said he was heartened by anti-Trump protests, he was sending a message of approval
[1:11:08.260 --> 1:11:14.180]  to his troops. Troops? Yes, Obama has an army of educators numbering more than 30,000. Yeah,
[1:11:14.180 --> 1:11:19.300]  that's just the core of brigades. What is that? Like eight brigades who will fight his Republican
[1:11:19.300 --> 1:11:26.420]  successor at every turn of his historic presidency and Obama will command them, get this, from a
[1:11:26.420 --> 1:11:31.220]  bunker less than two miles from the White House. Yeah, they got a damn bunker. They're getting
[1:11:31.220 --> 1:11:35.220]  ready for a war, folks. I was already told about this over a month ago and now I'm reading the
[1:11:35.220 --> 1:11:40.820]  paper. Oh God, I don't even want to tell you. The enemy already knows what Trump's planning
[1:11:40.820 --> 1:11:47.780]  if they try it, but I mean, it's just bad, man. We are so close, folks. In what shaping up to be
[1:11:47.780 --> 1:11:53.860]  a highly unusual post-presidency, Obama isn't just staying behind in Washington. He's working behind
[1:11:53.860 --> 1:11:58.740]  the scenes to set up what will effectively be a shadow government. No, it's not effectively,
[1:11:58.740 --> 1:12:05.060]  that's what it is. It not only protect his threatened legacy, but to sabotage the incoming
[1:12:05.060 --> 1:12:10.420]  administration and its popular America's first agenda and see they know when they've got the
[1:12:10.420 --> 1:12:14.420]  State Department blocking what he orders them to do and all this other stuff that they know if
[1:12:14.420 --> 1:12:19.540]  Trump moves against them. Oh my God, fascism. Oh my God, you're so evil. Oh, you just implemented
[1:12:19.540 --> 1:12:24.420]  the same law. It's one of the books for 40 years. Oh, it's so terrible. So they're openly involved
[1:12:24.420 --> 1:12:33.060]  in sedition against the country at the State Department and these other agencies. It's just
[1:12:33.060 --> 1:12:41.060]  mind-blowing. This is total insubordination on every front because the globalist stacked the
[1:12:41.060 --> 1:12:46.580]  government full of traders. And again, they're spiritual travelers. Most of them don't even
[1:12:46.580 --> 1:12:49.780]  know why they do it. They just think they're currying favor with the power structure. They
[1:12:49.780 --> 1:12:54.500]  see mainstream TV against Trump and they think they're going to be rewarded when they do horribly
[1:12:54.500 --> 1:12:59.860]  abusive, destructive things to this country in its deathbed hours unless we get resurrected
[1:12:59.860 --> 1:13:04.660]  like the Phoenix. Well, let me just tell the people that are doing all this and I'm sure you
[1:13:04.660 --> 1:13:10.980]  already understand this. If you're successful in derailing the Republic and bringing us into the
[1:13:10.980 --> 1:13:17.060]  nightmare scenario, you're going to be removed immediately, not by Trump, but by the people
[1:13:17.060 --> 1:13:23.060]  that have put you up to this. They don't want easily influenced mindless quizzlings in charge
[1:13:23.060 --> 1:13:28.820]  of all this stuff. You're going to be taken out by Hitler's essay within six months of the fall
[1:13:28.820 --> 1:13:38.740]  of this country. You will be the most hated, loathed people on earth. Why don't you open up a
[1:13:38.740 --> 1:13:48.260]  history book and find out the truth? So an array of tax-free foundations, mega banks, the big tax-free
[1:13:48.260 --> 1:13:55.220]  billionaires are all Goldman Sachs, all of them, all their power against Trump and the unlikely
[1:13:55.780 --> 1:14:01.300]  good guys in this whole thing. U.S. intelligence agencies, a group of them, it's the majority,
[1:14:02.260 --> 1:14:07.140]  who finally because of NSA data leaks, Benghazi went too far are like,
[1:14:07.140 --> 1:14:11.140]  really, we are ruled by pedophiles. They do want to make us all poor and they want to make everybody
[1:14:11.140 --> 1:14:15.140]  dumb and do all this and they really are putting cancer viruses in the vaccines. That's all now
[1:14:15.140 --> 1:14:21.700]  system-wide. The military's got it. Everybody's got it. And so the big problem they've got is their
[1:14:21.700 --> 1:14:25.700]  own enforcers, who they already hate so much because they go out and fight when you can't
[1:14:25.700 --> 1:14:31.060]  or sit back and let them do it. They now got a real mission to save this country and they
[1:14:31.060 --> 1:14:35.780]  understand what you're doing. And so they've got all the data on what you did do and who you are
[1:14:35.780 --> 1:14:39.700]  and what you stand for. But you've got all your, and I'm not saying all the civilian contractors,
[1:14:39.700 --> 1:14:43.940]  but your civilian contractors, they got two, three worthless degrees and are all on power
[1:14:43.940 --> 1:14:50.420]  trips and buying to the whole propaganda who really want a civil war. And they're arrogant
[1:14:50.420 --> 1:14:55.140]  folks and they really think they're going to win. And they're organizing riots all over this country.
[1:14:55.140 --> 1:14:59.540]  I'm going to come back and play the clips. They're organizing all sorts of civil war because this
[1:14:59.540 --> 1:15:07.300]  is what happened. The AI, Google and Facebook supercomputers told them they could win and install
[1:15:07.300 --> 1:15:16.740]  a walking corpse, an evil demonic warmonger like Hillary. They believed they could put her in power
[1:15:20.260 --> 1:15:24.020]  and they believed they could force feed us that on purpose because if we would accept
[1:15:24.020 --> 1:15:28.340]  that giant lie, you think it's crazy to sell her what they were thinking. No, they were trying to
[1:15:28.340 --> 1:15:32.980]  sell us a turd. They were trying to sell us a bucket of crap and tell us it was pumpkin pie.
[1:15:32.980 --> 1:15:36.660]  We didn't eat it folks. And that's why they're really pissed. They wanted to give us the poison
[1:15:36.660 --> 1:15:42.740]  dose, have us accept the delusion, you know, beating a horseman or thinking it's an apple
[1:15:42.740 --> 1:15:47.220]  in a hypnotism. They wanted us to lie to our senses and do it. We didn't do it. So all their
[1:15:47.220 --> 1:15:51.060]  algorithms got beaten. We're going to cover that when we come back. So that's why they're so scared
[1:15:51.060 --> 1:16:01.060]  because everything is reversing them. We're selling a product DNA force that is the very
[1:16:01.060 --> 1:16:06.420]  best nutraceutical that we can produce. Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA
[1:16:06.420 --> 1:16:10.900]  force for us. It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[1:16:10.900 --> 1:16:17.380]  it's very, very important. What the aging process is is when the cell replicates, we lose a little
[1:16:17.380 --> 1:16:22.580]  bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes. But when it
[1:16:22.580 --> 1:16:28.420]  runs out, you start dying. We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials. It's
[1:16:28.420 --> 1:16:34.340]  one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair
[1:16:34.340 --> 1:16:39.940]  nerve growth factor. So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[1:16:39.940 --> 1:16:45.300]  We have so many five star reviews. I take this. This is this is the product that I take.

[1:18:59.780 --> 1:19:07.140]  happened to America? They lost. We won. Want to see what Trump's up against? Revelation,
[1:19:07.140 --> 1:19:13.220]  the movie, dot info. Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[1:19:13.860 --> 1:19:20.900]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance. When I was a boy,
[1:19:20.900 --> 1:19:27.940]  it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie, gobs of school, morality,
[1:19:27.940 --> 1:19:36.020]  had a future, and beef was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global government. We're the solution.
[1:19:36.020 --> 1:19:41.300]  Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that. Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels,
[1:19:41.300 --> 1:19:47.540]  and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[1:19:47.540 --> 1:19:53.700]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue? Americans need to see this film.
[1:19:53.700 --> 1:20:01.300]  Revelation, the movie, dot info. Let's fix it.
[1:20:02.180 --> 1:20:09.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:09.300 --> 1:20:25.140]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:28.340 --> 1:20:32.340]  All right, it's real simple. The globalists openly, publicly want to make everybody poor,
[1:20:32.340 --> 1:20:35.700]  dump you down, give you cancer, virus injections, then watch you die.
[1:20:35.700 --> 1:20:41.060]  The model they ran in Russia reduced the population by about 40%. They run in other
[1:20:41.060 --> 1:20:47.460]  countries. Same story. They're losing control of nation states as the people discover that
[1:20:47.460 --> 1:20:56.580]  globalism is pure death. So they're panicking. And they're further weaponizing the media. But
[1:20:56.580 --> 1:21:03.460]  let me just read you headlines here that I haven't even gotten into and just little windows into what's
[1:21:03.460 --> 1:21:10.740]  happening in the world. White House policy advisor, Trump pursuing all options on travel ban,
[1:21:11.300 --> 1:21:17.780]  may issue a new executive order and then just constantly issue the executive orders and let
[1:21:17.780 --> 1:21:23.060]  courts just keep violating the law every week. You want to have a battle? You want to have
[1:21:23.060 --> 1:21:28.420]  your fake ruling that's clearly under law is a complete fraud. Never before done. Fine.
[1:21:29.700 --> 1:21:33.300]  He'll just issue more and you know, let the media laugh and say he's being defeated.
[1:21:33.300 --> 1:21:36.580]  Oh, look, he's fighting back for the country and being defeated. Oh, he's been defeated.
[1:21:37.700 --> 1:21:41.140]  Of course, it's going to be a train wreck securing our borders. Any other sovereign
[1:21:41.140 --> 1:21:47.540]  country has borders and decides who comes in. We can't bring people in from Somalia and Libya.
[1:21:47.540 --> 1:21:51.620]  They're failed states. They don't even have working airports for citizens.
[1:21:52.500 --> 1:21:59.140]  You'd be a crazy person to let people in. But Obama did it. Go ahead and play that club.
[1:21:59.140 --> 1:22:06.900]  Executive order, limiting the visitors and the refugees can come
[1:22:07.620 --> 1:22:10.740]  into this country. And will that be released this week?
[1:22:11.460 --> 1:22:16.420]  Right now, we are considering and pursuing all options. Those options include seeking an emergency
[1:22:16.420 --> 1:22:21.380]  stay at the Supreme Court, continuing the appeal with the panel, having an emergency hearing on
[1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:27.300]  bonk or going to the trial court in the district level and a trial on the merits. They also include,
[1:22:27.300 --> 1:22:32.340]  as you've mentioned, the possibility of new executive actions designed to prevent terrorist
[1:22:32.340 --> 1:22:36.500]  infiltration of our country. But I want to say something very clearly. And this is going to be
[1:22:36.500 --> 1:22:40.900]  very disappointing to the people protesting the president and the people in Congress,
[1:22:40.900 --> 1:22:45.540]  like Senator Schumer, who've attacked the president for his lawful and necessary action.
[1:22:45.540 --> 1:22:51.780]  The president's powers here are beyond question. The president has the authority under the INA
[1:22:51.780 --> 1:23:00.020]  section to suspend the entry of aliens into this country. And he has Article 2 foreign powers
[1:23:00.020 --> 1:23:04.660]  to also engage in conducting border control and immigration control into this country.
[1:23:04.660 --> 1:23:09.220]  Those powers are substantial. They represent the very apex of presidential authority.
[1:23:09.220 --> 1:23:14.100]  And so we are contemplating new and additional actions to ensure that our immigration system
[1:23:14.100 --> 1:23:18.740]  does not become a vehicle for admitting people into our country who are hostile to this nation
[1:23:18.740 --> 1:23:22.900]  and its values. That's right. The globalists are bringing people in that have been brainwashed to
[1:23:22.900 --> 1:23:29.940]  be against us by Islam, Ford Foundation, you name it. And I like that Steve Miller, great young
[1:23:29.940 --> 1:23:37.460]  focus spokesman with authority, explaining it's unequivocal. It's undebatable that in total law,
[1:23:37.460 --> 1:23:43.940]  this is what the president's purview is. It's like saying Tiger Woods isn't allowed to play golf.
[1:23:43.940 --> 1:23:51.060]  I mean, it's water isn't allowed to be wet. This is what, this is so, but again, it is an assault
[1:23:51.060 --> 1:23:57.140]  on sovereignty, an assault on the executive, an assault on the presidency. And I love how
[1:23:57.140 --> 1:24:01.220]  they gave all this power to the presidency that wasn't even its power because they thought they
[1:24:01.220 --> 1:24:05.380]  owned it and controlled it. Now they're panicking saying the presidency doesn't have any of its powers.
[1:24:07.940 --> 1:24:12.340]  Trump tweets, our legal system is broken. The media is like, you attacked the judiciary.
[1:24:12.340 --> 1:24:17.380]  Other presidents arrested the judiciary. And I'm not calling for that, but it's just,
[1:24:17.380 --> 1:24:22.740]  they know the public doesn't have any historical context. And so it's weird to watch like people
[1:24:22.740 --> 1:24:28.580]  that are still under the spell go, oh look, he's in trouble. No, he's trailblazing to defend this
[1:24:28.580 --> 1:24:36.580]  country. I mean, it's just true. You can't but admire this. It's the total opposite of Obama.
[1:24:36.580 --> 1:24:42.420]  Now in camped miles from the winehouse running foreign bank attacks on our president.
[1:24:44.340 --> 1:24:47.380]  And I know Trump likes to act confident. He is confident and just thinks, you know,
[1:24:47.380 --> 1:24:49.380]  I'm doing the right thing of them. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. But
[1:24:50.420 --> 1:24:53.620]  he ought to just really tell people your whole country's under attack. They're trying to kill
[1:24:53.620 --> 1:24:57.860]  our sovereignty. Foreign banks are doing this. I guess that would hurt the stock market so he
[1:24:57.860 --> 1:25:08.580]  can't do it. He has to sit there and be under total attack by scum and not even tell you what's going on.
[1:25:12.580 --> 1:25:15.140]  You know, I'm not going to tell you the stuff I know yet. I'm going to wait till tomorrow.
[1:25:18.500 --> 1:25:23.780]  I just, you know, everybody wants to like go see movies about spies and stuff. And they want
[1:25:23.780 --> 1:25:29.620]  everybody wants authority and power. No, you don't want that. Again, people want to sit there and
[1:25:29.620 --> 1:25:34.900]  watch TV and imagine that they're involved in something big because they support, you know,
[1:25:34.900 --> 1:25:38.500]  comedy central's attack on the president. People keep saying, we used to always be against the
[1:25:38.500 --> 1:25:42.740]  president. Why are you so far now? Because we got an American in there. He ain't perfect,
[1:25:42.740 --> 1:25:47.780]  but he's, I'm going to say it again. He's not out to get you. He's doing it. Ron Paul,
[1:25:48.660 --> 1:25:52.820]  who I know doesn't want to be political. It doesn't want to throw in for Trump because
[1:25:52.820 --> 1:25:56.900]  Trump went after his son, but his son attacked first. And Paul was on two weeks ago and he goes,
[1:25:57.620 --> 1:26:01.540]  I want to tell the president he's doing a great job on the economy. It's wonderful.
[1:26:01.540 --> 1:26:09.620]  It's basically fantastic, but it's too little, too late. And Paul's an economist. He's a doctor.
[1:26:09.620 --> 1:26:13.780]  He's a smart guy. He loves his country. And Paul got all the most animated. I've seen him
[1:26:13.780 --> 1:26:19.380]  knowing him 20. I've known Ron Paul 21 years. I've had dinner at luncheons with him and, you know,
[1:26:19.380 --> 1:26:23.300]  I've never seen Paul get so excited even about his own son when he went, no,
[1:26:23.300 --> 1:26:28.740]  Trump's doing really good on the economy. It's wonderful because it's real. It's real.
[1:26:30.180 --> 1:26:35.460]  The whole enemy combines against him. And that's what's so ridiculous in the fools out there.
[1:26:38.020 --> 1:26:41.460]  Let's sit there and go, oh, Alex Jones is the, you know, the
[1:26:42.500 --> 1:26:49.060]  Austin branch of Trump. I'm the Austin branch of the Republic. And if I see somebody trying to
[1:26:49.060 --> 1:26:54.180]  save the country and trying to do things to get money and jobs, the average person,
[1:26:54.740 --> 1:26:58.340]  it makes me sick. Not even in an angry way towards people that attack Trump,
[1:26:59.140 --> 1:27:06.660]  but it makes me sick for you because you were diseased. Your minds are diseased when it comes
[1:27:06.660 --> 1:27:12.820]  down to the actual moment when the real thing is right there in front of you. And I don't want to
[1:27:12.820 --> 1:27:16.980]  use Christ analogies for Trump because he's far from that. He's just a manly man and an alpha male
[1:27:16.980 --> 1:27:20.900]  and it not to screw you over and hates globalist and understands what's going on and thinks he
[1:27:20.900 --> 1:27:25.620]  can beat him. It's really the ultimate challenge of a warrior. He's ready to do it. He's a damn
[1:27:25.620 --> 1:27:30.980]  manly man, a little bit worldly. I'm the same way. He's a sinner. He's not a Christ like figure,
[1:27:30.980 --> 1:27:34.020]  but I'll tell you, compared to the new old order, he's a Christ like figure.
[1:27:36.420 --> 1:27:40.820]  And Christ is there. No crimes. Pontius Pilate has said he's done nothing wrong.
[1:27:40.820 --> 1:27:47.140]  And it's that day on the holiday when they let somebody sentenced to death go and Pontius
[1:27:47.140 --> 1:27:53.220]  Pilate, the Roman judge there in Jerusalem says, Hey, you can let Jesus Christ of Nazareth go right
[1:27:53.220 --> 1:28:01.300]  now. You can let him go right now. I find no crime. Let him go. And the crowd says, give us
[1:28:01.300 --> 1:28:12.100]  Barabbas. Give us Hillary. Give us Obama. Give us the devil. Give us Barabbas. He says, you
[1:28:12.100 --> 1:28:18.100]  really want Barabbas? The murderer, the rapist, the thief, the scumbag and the people didn't want
[1:28:18.100 --> 1:28:24.260]  Christ. They wanted Barabbas. And that's what this is like watching. And again, we're going to beat
[1:28:24.260 --> 1:28:30.420]  them. This, this reprieve might be 20, 30 years long just to get humanity a base to warn against
[1:28:30.420 --> 1:28:33.860]  the machines, the takeover, you know, the true threats that are coming. God's going to give
[1:28:33.860 --> 1:28:39.300]  us that gulp of air before the big, the big test. But I could, I could see it all now,
[1:28:39.300 --> 1:28:44.660]  like it was written with a flaming hand on the wall or like Moses, you know, a Mount Ararat
[1:28:44.660 --> 1:28:50.500]  with God's flaming finger. It's so clear now. I almost say to myself is, you know,
[1:28:51.860 --> 1:28:55.540]  just what a time to be alive. Okay. I'm gonna be a good boy. We're gonna have a bunch of stories
[1:28:55.540 --> 1:29:01.140]  when we come back. Hey, everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side. And as many
[1:29:01.140 --> 1:29:05.540]  of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking

[1:29:16.740 --> 1:29:20.500]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows
[1:29:20.500 --> 1:29:25.060]  at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a health challenge or if

[1:31:58.180 --> 1:32:04.100]  We have the new product at infowarslife.com, Biotru Selenium. We've had so many requests
[1:32:04.100 --> 1:32:10.100]  over the years for Selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic
[1:32:10.100 --> 1:32:15.540]  bioavailable Selenium from Mustard Seed Extract. When you take Selenium in the body,
[1:32:15.540 --> 1:32:21.300]  it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body. It helps balance the thyroid gland,
[1:32:21.300 --> 1:32:27.220]  it helps detoxify. Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves. The highest concentration
[1:32:27.220 --> 1:32:31.220]  of Selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body. As a matter of
[1:32:31.220 --> 1:32:38.420]  fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon Selenium. So it really is
[1:32:38.420 --> 1:32:44.980]  a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs. I'm taking it now every day. This is Shoki
[1:32:44.980 --> 1:32:50.100]  Biotru Selenium is the product, the best Selenium that we could bring you. We believe it's the best
[1:32:50.100 --> 1:32:54.740]  out there at a very, very low price. Exclusively available at infowarslife.com or by calling toll
[1:32:54.740 --> 1:33:13.220]  free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:13.220 --> 1:33:25.300]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:27.300 --> 1:33:31.380]  You know, a lot of leftists get into victimology. They want to be victims, but they really are
[1:33:31.380 --> 1:33:37.300]  victims. They're brainwashed. They're dumbed down. They're ignorant and they love their slavery.
[1:33:38.660 --> 1:33:42.020]  I've got a bunch of clips here I haven't gotten to all over the country. In fact,
[1:33:42.020 --> 1:33:46.420]  I don't know where my clip list is. Here it is. All over the country, colleges, universities,
[1:33:46.420 --> 1:33:52.180]  that's the government. The special interest, the big bank-funded systems are saying,
[1:33:52.740 --> 1:33:57.700]  go out and fight the white supremacist Donald Trump. But on its face, that isn't even true.
[1:33:59.220 --> 1:34:03.780]  So you see that they use America's openness of the world to then bring in the minorities to try
[1:34:03.780 --> 1:34:09.620]  to make them racist, but that hasn't even worked. So it's mainly led by a bunch of weird white women
[1:34:09.620 --> 1:34:14.260]  that are just running around screaming, burn down the culture, even though they don't even get the
[1:34:14.260 --> 1:34:21.380]  spoils of the takeover. That's what's so pathetic about it. But we have a practical guide for
[1:34:21.380 --> 1:34:27.060]  resisting the Trump agenda. Brave new films, Duke University, but we've got major universities
[1:34:27.060 --> 1:34:32.820]  training people to attack and fight. What's the first rule of leftist fight club? That's right.
[1:34:32.820 --> 1:34:37.860]  You'll tell everybody about the leftist fight club. That's how let me think and find something
[1:34:37.860 --> 1:34:48.340]  that works and then do the opposite. So they're saying, go out and attack everybody and go beat
[1:34:48.340 --> 1:34:52.660]  women up and then the media will just cover it up and Robert Reich will go on seeing it and say
[1:34:52.660 --> 1:34:57.540]  the right wingers attack people at Berkeley, even though there's hundreds of videos of it being the
[1:34:57.540 --> 1:35:02.980]  opposite. But they are really destroying themselves. They really are running out of gas. In fact,
[1:35:02.980 --> 1:35:07.140]  I've got articles out of the New York Times saying, oh my gosh, Saturday Night Live is running out of
[1:35:07.140 --> 1:35:11.700]  gas. They're exhausted. They keep attacking. It's not doing anything and their ratings are dropping.
[1:35:13.380 --> 1:35:18.420]  But the few little sheep that watch and still believe, they feel great. Meanwhile,
[1:35:18.420 --> 1:35:22.900]  Meryl Streep is in the New York Times. Meryl Streep pledges to stand up to brown shirts,
[1:35:22.900 --> 1:35:28.820]  that means SA storm trippers that brought the Nazis to power, in tirade against Trump and calls for
[1:35:28.820 --> 1:35:36.580]  people to hit the streets, which is what the brown shirts did. This is a woman, friends with
[1:35:36.580 --> 1:35:44.020]  Roman Polanski, who pushed for a movement to have his sentence suspended for raping a kidnapped
[1:35:44.020 --> 1:35:53.700]  little girl, anally, 13-year-old girl. Roman Polanski admittedly raped one of many, don't worry.
[1:35:53.700 --> 1:35:58.820]  That's the report. And she loves him because see, that's just some little girl. That's a nobody.
[1:35:58.820 --> 1:36:04.180]  She's an elitist, a nobody. So, okay, you want to call to fight the brown shirts with a bunch
[1:36:04.180 --> 1:36:12.020]  of brown shirts to your own? Meryl Streep, the pedophile apologist. What a sack of crap. Disconnected
[1:36:12.020 --> 1:36:18.420]  from reality, there in Los Angeles in that smog-infested zombie land, lecturing the rest of
[1:36:18.420 --> 1:36:24.420]  it. Oh, and here's the articles I mentioned it. Review, SNL, target Trump again with a hint of
[1:36:24.420 --> 1:36:34.180]  exhaustion. Isn't that just special? GOP dilemma on health law, taxes to repeal or not to repeal.
[1:36:34.180 --> 1:36:43.860]  Yeah, the people funded by George Soros, Paul Ryan. Oh, look, he has a psychopath's jaw and
[1:36:43.860 --> 1:36:53.940]  blue eyes. Let's do whatever Paul Ryan says. He comes out and says, oh, we can't get rid of it
[1:36:53.940 --> 1:36:58.500]  right now because there's nothing better to replace it, to discredit everything. It's a
[1:36:58.500 --> 1:37:03.380]  screw job. It's written by foreign banks and insurance companies to rob people, repeal it,
[1:37:03.380 --> 1:37:07.380]  go back to what we had, give poor people free health care. That's already in the law anyways.
[1:37:08.100 --> 1:37:14.100]  Again, but they just act like, oh, the Trump's defeated. Look, his own party admits it. Who was
[1:37:14.100 --> 1:37:20.900]  the former minion of Paul Ryan, rinse previous? And who is in Trump's White House, rinse previous?
[1:37:20.900 --> 1:37:28.260]  And who is the problem, rinse previous? And who's holding everything up, rinse previous?
[1:37:31.940 --> 1:37:38.500]  Isn't that just special? State GOP leaders move swiftly as party bickers in Congress.
[1:37:38.500 --> 1:37:41.780]  And that's the good news. The New York Times actually admits it, trying to tell their own
[1:37:41.780 --> 1:37:46.420]  people where to go battle from Kentucky to Texas. Do you name it? The conservative patriot,
[1:37:46.420 --> 1:37:51.940]  common sense revolution, reversing globalism, a steamrolling ahead with governors and legislatures
[1:37:51.940 --> 1:37:56.100]  elected, all of the country in the biggest landslide in history. Of course, you know who
[1:37:56.100 --> 1:38:02.500]  the Patriots won last week because of Trump. Oh, I mean the Russians. I'm sorry, Trump means Russian.
[1:38:02.500 --> 1:38:05.940]  And then of course, this, I'm sure all those state winnings were the Russians too. They just
[1:38:05.940 --> 1:38:11.700]  are omnipresent. They can't run their own country, but they can run us though. And the same state
[1:38:11.700 --> 1:38:19.060]  department has come out and says they're going to come out with more Russian info on the president.
[1:38:19.780 --> 1:38:22.180]  They're going to block other nationalist movements around the world because, you know,
[1:38:22.180 --> 1:38:25.380]  the Russians are behind those. Well, boy, these are good Russians then, aren't they?
[1:38:26.100 --> 1:38:30.020]  The cancer of globalism and Russia doesn't be part of it. They're not manipulating anything.
[1:38:30.020 --> 1:38:34.660]  Russia is the example and that's it. So there is a kernel of truth to it. Here's the Wall
[1:38:34.660 --> 1:38:39.860]  Street Journal. Donald Trump's diplomatic moderation. Yeah, he threatens all these
[1:38:39.860 --> 1:38:43.940]  countries that are doing one side of deals. You better invest here. And Japan now has announced
[1:38:43.940 --> 1:38:49.380]  three, it was a couple hundred billion a week ago, 300 billion investment this year. And all these
[1:38:49.380 --> 1:38:54.260]  new deals and all these new things and all these new weapons buys from the U.S. that I don't particularly
[1:38:54.260 --> 1:39:01.460]  love that, but we're in a war system of weapons. So whatever the point is, Trump threatened them.
[1:39:01.460 --> 1:39:07.300]  So they would then give us a good deal. And the media goes, oh, look, Trump demanded all this
[1:39:07.300 --> 1:39:12.580]  and he only got half of it. That's called a negotiation. That's what a negotiation is.
[1:39:15.700 --> 1:39:21.540]  Oh, look, Donald Trump's only gotten 300 billion so far in office in three weeks from Japan and
[1:39:21.540 --> 1:39:26.100]  some better trade deals. He didn't get everything he said. He's a horrible person.
[1:39:28.100 --> 1:39:31.620]  No, the Japanese family got there. They went, oh, you want to negotiate for the first time ever and
[1:39:31.620 --> 1:39:35.860]  not just make deals with our companies, with politicians to keep money with Japan and screw
[1:39:35.860 --> 1:39:39.780]  your people. We thought it was very dishonorable screwing you over. We'd actually like to do
[1:39:39.780 --> 1:39:45.380]  real business deals with you now. That's what Japan's saying. Oh, you want to do real deals
[1:39:45.380 --> 1:39:53.380]  with us? Sure, we'll do real deals with you. And the media is like, you see, Trump, you only got
[1:39:53.380 --> 1:40:00.500]  half of what he said he'd give from Japan. What a dumbass. I hate that Trump man. God, all these
[1:40:00.500 --> 1:40:05.700]  new Toyota factories and all these soft bank investments and all these robotics factories and
[1:40:05.700 --> 1:40:11.540]  all these chip factories and all these R&D factories in Japan investing its next 10 years of money
[1:40:11.540 --> 1:40:16.980]  almost exclusively in us in a big alliance against China. Man, Trump, you're an idiot. What's your
[1:40:16.980 --> 1:40:22.820]  problem? You actually just brought the US into leadership position for the next 20 years with
[1:40:22.820 --> 1:40:32.100]  Japan. How dare you? I tell you, this Trump's horrible, isn't he? All those new Toyota factories,
[1:40:32.100 --> 1:40:36.420]  all those new Chrysler factories, all those new Ford factories, all those new steel mills.
[1:40:37.380 --> 1:40:41.300]  Yeah, he's even gotten the Indians and the Japanese to announce steel mills in America.
[1:40:42.740 --> 1:40:49.140]  What a horrible KKK member. That matter, he never part of the KKK. I'll just say KKK. It's a fancy
[1:40:49.140 --> 1:40:55.540]  word. KKK, go away. Teach the children how to be trannies every day.
[1:40:55.540 --> 1:41:04.020]  What are you against, trannies? No, I don't really have it on my radar screen.
[1:41:04.740 --> 1:41:09.460]  The issue is they're trying to sexualize our children and screw them up and tell them their
[1:41:09.460 --> 1:41:14.740]  mental patients and the colleges are giant mental institutions now where they admit in the documents
[1:41:14.740 --> 1:41:19.380]  we published last week with John Rappaport that they know the degrees are worthless. They know
[1:41:19.380 --> 1:41:24.100]  they're sabotaging upper mobility. They know they're sabotaging the free open western culture of
[1:41:24.100 --> 1:41:31.140]  renaissance. Not perfect, better than anywhere else because they don't want true intellectuals
[1:41:33.140 --> 1:41:37.140]  to challenge their takeover. You know, I've done an hour and 41 minutes and they keep telling me,
[1:41:37.140 --> 1:41:41.060]  hey, I wish you might want to plug something. That's how we really fund ourselves. The network
[1:41:41.060 --> 1:41:46.260]  adds you here. We don't really make fund ourselves with that. Yeah, I'm really surprised in the
[1:41:46.260 --> 1:41:52.420]  audience and thankful. We set out to put out the very best organic fluoride free toothpaste out there
[1:41:52.420 --> 1:41:55.940]  and about two years ago, three years ago, I was like, I'm just going to call the biggest organic
[1:41:55.940 --> 1:41:59.620]  toothpaste maker in the country and I'm just going to buy it for them and sell it. My dad said,
[1:41:59.620 --> 1:42:04.340]  why not private label it and add colloidal silver and iodine? And I said, Dad, my dad's retired
[1:42:04.340 --> 1:42:09.780]  dentist. That's a great idea. We did it and it's just the best organic fluoride free toothpaste in
[1:42:09.780 --> 1:42:14.180]  the country. Private label by us with iodine and colloidal silver added. It's got the peppermint
[1:42:14.180 --> 1:42:17.700]  and it's got everything else in it. We've got a bubblegum flavor coming out soon. It'll be here
[1:42:17.700 --> 1:42:23.860]  soon. It's being made up in Maine where it doesn't have the tea tree oil or the peppermint, so it's
[1:42:23.860 --> 1:42:28.340]  not as strong, but obviously not as good. But kids, it's a little strong for kids, but it's powerful.
[1:42:28.340 --> 1:42:33.700]  So you want the big swinging, you know what, a toothpaste. It's at infowarstore.com or call

[1:44:35.380 --> 1:44:41.540]  The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.

[1:46:02.740 --> 1:46:07.460]  stock at infowarstore.com. The first shipment of super blue sold out in one week. I thought it
[1:46:07.460 --> 1:46:11.700]  would be a six month supply for listeners and since then people are beating down our doors
[1:46:11.700 --> 1:46:16.660]  wanting to be able to resupply their super blue research across the board is clear. In fact,
[1:46:16.660 --> 1:46:21.220]  it's certified. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute
[1:46:21.220 --> 1:46:25.700]  to blood clots and heart attacks. That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health
[1:46:25.700 --> 1:46:30.500]  warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body. Super blue fluoride
[1:46:30.500 --> 1:46:35.140]  free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodide, so the bad

[1:47:16.100 --> 1:47:32.420]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:47:32.420 --> 1:47:35.780]  That's right folks. Thanks for joining us here today. I didn't take any calls. I will tomorrow.
[1:47:35.780 --> 1:47:45.060]  I'll be back 11am to 3pm central. We've got buses to another day on earth, but we've got to a lot
[1:47:45.060 --> 1:47:51.380]  today. I haven't gotten to just the total organized crime of sedition to overthrow the election
[1:47:52.980 --> 1:47:58.900]  and universities training for fight clubs, physical attacks, how to go out and just storm events.
[1:47:59.780 --> 1:48:05.940]  And the answer is not even so much public events. Those are great. But city council meetings,
[1:48:05.940 --> 1:48:10.900]  county commissioner meetings, using any platform and citizens communications to talk about real
[1:48:10.900 --> 1:48:16.260]  issues and what's happening to show other people this is very important that we're not alone.
[1:48:17.380 --> 1:48:20.420]  The social engineers greatest tool is making us feel like we're alone.
[1:48:21.460 --> 1:48:25.140]  And that's why they hate Trump because they put everything they had, their algorithms,
[1:48:25.140 --> 1:48:32.340]  their brainwashing, all of it into play and Trump still won. Hillary clearly stole five states.
[1:48:32.340 --> 1:48:36.420]  She tried to steal six others. They got caught breaking into the computers. It all came out.
[1:48:36.420 --> 1:48:41.060]  That's why Trump says I want an investigation. They go, it's crazy. There's no fraud.
[1:48:42.100 --> 1:48:47.540]  It's like a neighbor you catch in bed with your wife on top of her. He's like, I'm not in bed with
[1:48:47.540 --> 1:48:59.300]  your wife. That's how dumb they think we are. That's my greatest frustration is that people
[1:48:59.300 --> 1:49:10.900]  that lie to themselves about what's happening, they're conning themselves. Donald Trump is a
[1:49:10.900 --> 1:49:17.300]  nationalist. He's represented by patriots in our government and the population that want real prosperity
[1:49:17.300 --> 1:49:31.060]  back. And all the media says is KKK because that's all they got. It's idiocy. Meanwhile,
[1:49:31.060 --> 1:49:36.020]  look at this headline out of French news agency, how algorithms secretly run the world. Well,
[1:49:36.020 --> 1:49:40.980]  there's no secret here, but I thought nobody secretly ran it. They want the big algorithms
[1:49:40.980 --> 1:49:46.260]  that track everything you do to manipulate your purchases, your data, your behavior, your life,
[1:49:46.260 --> 1:49:52.420]  to control you and make you not exist. And in this AFP, that's as big as the Associated Press
[1:49:52.420 --> 1:50:00.180]  article, they admit all this. Now, again, I told you this 18 years ago, not because I wanted to
[1:50:00.180 --> 1:50:06.020]  be Mr. Fancy Pants, but because I was told this by top NSA people who were really freaked out
[1:50:06.020 --> 1:50:12.660]  about tech heads, beliefs that they would in free will. And people are like, that's really uncool.
[1:50:12.660 --> 1:50:18.580]  I got kids. I got grandkids. What are you talking about? Oh, shut up. You'll never stop it. Someone
[1:50:18.580 --> 1:50:23.620]  will use this technology. Our species is falling. It wouldn't be able to be manipulated by this.
[1:50:23.620 --> 1:50:28.580]  Let's just join with it. It's like, what are you, the devil? Yes, we are. Join.
[1:50:32.420 --> 1:50:37.540]  And they don't even want the power on this planet. They want you to join them. That's the
[1:50:37.540 --> 1:50:43.540]  decision. This planet is a simulation. It's a real third dimensional simulation. It's real.
[1:50:43.540 --> 1:50:48.980]  There's fish in the water and mountains and volcanoes and women and men and babies and life
[1:50:48.980 --> 1:50:54.340]  and, you know, supermarkets. But it's just a test.
[1:50:57.060 --> 1:51:01.940]  God, it's so fabulous. It's so fabulous. And we just transcend them and we're aware of it. I mean,
[1:51:01.940 --> 1:51:07.780]  look at this headline. Also out of AFP, turmoil grows over Winehouse Correspondents' Dinner. Many
[1:51:07.780 --> 1:51:12.500]  are saying they shouldn't go and boycott it because Trump's the president. It isn't a White House
[1:51:12.500 --> 1:51:19.540]  Correspondents' Dinner if Trump doesn't show up. President Trump, if you do one thing, stop caring
[1:51:19.540 --> 1:51:27.540]  about fake press and say, I'm not going. Most of that is fake press and fake news who tried to
[1:51:27.540 --> 1:51:31.540]  make an issue out of it. And they said they're boycotting it. I'm boycotting it. End it. Take
[1:51:31.540 --> 1:51:37.540]  their power away. You're not going to convert them. Don't listen to Spicer and Priebus and all these
[1:51:37.540 --> 1:51:48.340]  other Paul Ryan enemy minions. Disempower them. Shut them off. Expel them into the Phantom Zone.
[1:51:49.140 --> 1:51:54.740]  Do not be any part of these people. Notice how Trump's so nice. They're like, oh, we're not
[1:51:54.740 --> 1:52:00.180]  going to show up. We're going to boycott him. They don't exist without that. The people's elected
[1:52:00.180 --> 1:52:05.860]  representatives. They're in open revolt. Say, the country's in too big of a crisis. I'm too busy
[1:52:05.860 --> 1:52:10.180]  trying to get the economy going. I'm sorry. I can't come to your press center. I know Trump wants to
[1:52:10.180 --> 1:52:16.660]  wade in and dominate them. And that's Trump's worldliness. See, God sends
[1:52:18.020 --> 1:52:22.580]  special kind of person to twist the knife in the enemy's side. Someone enough like them
[1:52:23.380 --> 1:52:29.780]  that he can actually get through to them. Trump's a very good man. I'm just saying the
[1:52:29.780 --> 1:52:35.380]  true thing is to say I'm not going to it. The media will spin it. Oh, you're a coward. You didn't
[1:52:35.380 --> 1:52:39.300]  show up. You're afraid. Don't let your advisors manipulate you. That's saying, no, I've already
[1:52:39.300 --> 1:52:44.260]  faced the media and defeated it with the American people. We have the people's work to do. I'm going
[1:52:44.260 --> 1:52:52.740]  to hold a correspondence dinner with veterans groups or with minority groups about talking
[1:52:52.740 --> 1:52:57.060]  about their companies and getting other companies to come invest in minority areas.
[1:52:57.060 --> 1:53:03.140]  Don't like, oh, we're going to give the minorities just some money so we control them. No,
[1:53:03.140 --> 1:53:05.700]  we're going to have a big meeting with a bunch of minority groups and we'll have
[1:53:06.580 --> 1:53:10.980]  30% wider, whatever it doesn't matter. But make it a focal point on, we're going to have a big
[1:53:10.980 --> 1:53:15.380]  meeting just about celebrating Americana and new companies and Trump bringing folks up and talking
[1:53:15.380 --> 1:53:19.940]  about what they do and what somebody want to invest with them and just move past a bunch of
[1:53:19.940 --> 1:53:25.860]  narcissistic, crazy people. The White House Correspondence Center might have 10 million live
[1:53:25.860 --> 1:53:30.900]  viewers, maybe 50, 60 million will end up watching Clubs 7. I mean, we have that in a week sometimes.
[1:53:31.460 --> 1:53:36.660]  Again, why is it the God? Because we're used to it. It's like breaking a habit of smoking
[1:53:36.660 --> 1:53:41.620]  cigarettes or drinking a bottle of Jack Daniels every day. Get out of it. Come out of it. Get
[1:53:41.620 --> 1:53:48.740]  away from it. Stop giving it power. Announce what it is. Trump's real power is in declaring he will
[1:53:48.740 --> 1:53:54.900]  stand up against those assaulting us. Ever seen a president say he's going to investigate vaccines?
[1:53:54.900 --> 1:53:58.580]  Trump's doing it. Ever seen a president say he's going to investigate all the rest of it?
[1:53:58.580 --> 1:54:03.540]  That's why they're so panicked. Meanwhile, a practical guide to resisting the Trump agenda.
[1:54:03.540 --> 1:54:08.420]  This is at a Duke University. Here's the report. A very, very important report. Here it is.
[1:54:14.820 --> 1:54:18.820]  If you're like me, you've been pretty freaked out about Trump and his agenda.
[1:54:18.820 --> 1:54:24.340]  Good news. Smart people with tons of experience in how politics really work have put together
[1:54:24.340 --> 1:54:30.340]  a practical guide on how to make Congress listen to us that you can find at indivisibleguide.com.
[1:54:31.380 --> 1:54:35.780]  Yeah, these people are just astroturfed to make the general public think it's the people. It's
[1:54:35.780 --> 1:54:39.940]  all the big money that's already against Trump, already trying to block him, already the Goldman
[1:54:39.940 --> 1:54:45.060]  Sachs money, all of it. So this is just so you think it's about people so you kind of think
[1:54:45.060 --> 1:54:51.700]  you're with the power structure. Okay, that's all, you know, the trendy woman. Keep going.
[1:54:51.700 --> 1:54:58.500] .com. Members of Congress only care about their constituents. And that means you. You will have
[1:54:58.500 --> 1:55:04.020]  three simple targets, your two U.S. senators and your representative. You will let them know how
[1:55:04.020 --> 1:55:09.300]  you feel about every important issue that comes up. But a warning, it's going to require a little
[1:55:09.300 --> 1:55:14.340]  more than just calls and positions. Let's hit pause. They don't want you involved in TPP that
[1:55:14.340 --> 1:55:18.260]  Trump just killed. They don't want you involved in carbon taxes Trump just killed. Or they don't
[1:55:18.260 --> 1:55:21.460]  want you involved in letting Christian refugees in. They're actually being murdered that Trump
[1:55:21.460 --> 1:55:28.100]  expanded for the Middle East. No, see that those are brown people that are compatible with our
[1:55:28.100 --> 1:55:32.980]  Christian society, our liberal society or open society. Say what you want as Christian societies
[1:55:32.980 --> 1:55:39.300]  that have been more over than anybody. She wants you to be LGBT as if anybody's persecuting LGBTB.
[1:55:39.940 --> 1:55:44.660]  As if, again, it's all like football issues that don't matter. We're going to make sure about your
[1:55:44.660 --> 1:55:50.500]  LGBT. Okay, just be distracted with that while we screw you over. So let's go back to the lady
[1:55:50.500 --> 1:55:55.460]  they focus groups who came off as the most realistic. So let's go back to vampire woman.
[1:55:57.380 --> 1:56:02.260]  This all begins when you join a local group or start your own. Once you're part of a team,
[1:56:02.260 --> 1:56:08.580]  there are four simple tactics to engage in. Town halls. Members of Congress will hold them.
[1:56:08.580 --> 1:56:13.060]  You just have to show up and use the public comment section to voice your opinion. Public
[1:56:13.060 --> 1:56:18.500]  events. Your members of Congress will be out there cutting ribbons and kissing babies. You need to
[1:56:18.500 --> 1:56:23.700]  be there asking the smart questions and holding them accountable to issues they are on the wrong
[1:56:23.700 --> 1:56:29.700]  side of or thanking them for being on the right side in hard times. Office visits. Members of
[1:56:29.700 --> 1:56:35.860]  Congress take meetings, schedule one or just show up and bring some friends. Let them know you care,
[1:56:35.860 --> 1:56:42.180]  you vote and you are watching them. Call them. Work with local groups to participate in mass
[1:56:42.180 --> 1:56:46.820]  call days so your members of Congress can't ignore their constant ringing phones and full
[1:56:46.820 --> 1:56:52.740]  voice. It's not going to be cancer, viruses and the vaccines. The show is over. I'll be back
[1:56:52.740 --> 1:56:55.460]  tomorrow. I love you all. Thanks for the career. The great job they're doing. I didn't get to a
[1:56:55.460 --> 1:57:00.660]  lot of it, but I'll cover more tomorrow. It's just so sad. These big foundations, all the big money,
[1:57:00.660 --> 1:57:06.420]  all the big power against Trump, against America, against nationalism from Brazil to Nigeria.
[1:57:06.420 --> 1:57:10.820]  They're trying to block nationalism. Not that countries are perfect, but they were set up by
[1:57:10.820 --> 1:57:15.540]  us and cultures that had some type of connection. Globalism is completely anti-human.
[1:57:15.540 --> 1:57:23.540]  And again, the answer is obviously everything she said, but us doing it. It's time to
[1:57:23.540 --> 1:57:28.100]  unsheathe the sword of truth. There's never been a time when the sword is cut stronger.
[1:57:28.980 --> 1:57:33.540]  Believe me, you get involved in the path of liberty, the heavens open up, the discernment,
[1:57:34.180 --> 1:57:41.140]  and the true message and journey and destiny of humanity is clear. I'm Alex Jones. This is
[1:57:41.140 --> 1:57:46.740]  the InfoWars. Infowars.com is our website. God bless you all.
