[00:00.000 --> 00:04.800]  could be a delay in further reductions of U.S. troops from Iraq until at least later
[00:04.800 --> 00:10.280]  in the year. The New York Times reports senior military commanders have made that recommendation
[00:10.280 --> 00:15.560]  in a report to the Bush administration. President Bush meanwhile likely to make a decision
[00:15.560 --> 00:21.120]  by April 1 concerning additional withdrawals. State Department warning Americans against
[00:21.120 --> 00:28.200]  travel to China's Tibetan Autonomous Region, officials expressing safety and security concerns
[00:28.200 --> 00:33.200]  for U.S. citizens, and Americans in Tibet are discouraged from traveling to areas where
[00:33.200 --> 00:39.800]  demonstrations are taking place. Russia has agreed to conditions set by Israel concerning
[00:39.800 --> 00:47.360]  the delivery of armored vehicles to a number of Palestinian security forces. You're listening
[00:47.360 --> 00:52.200]  to IRN USA Radio News.

[01:57.380 --> 02:01.960]  have all been breached. State Department spokesman Sean McCormick blamed the breaches on new
[02:01.960 --> 02:07.560]  people who were brought in to deal with a huge passport backlog last year. The State Department's
[02:07.560 --> 02:12.480]  Inspector General will be conducting a full investigation of the unauthorized access. Secretary
[02:12.480 --> 02:17.120]  of State Condoleezza Rice talked about calling Senator Obama. I told him that I was sorry
[02:17.120 --> 02:20.520]  and I told him that I myself would be very disturbed if I learned that somebody had looked
[02:20.520 --> 02:25.240]  into my passport file. Rice also apologized to Clinton and was expected to do the same
[02:25.240 --> 02:30.760]  with McCain who was overseas. I'm Terry Moore in Washington. Two elderly women in California
[02:30.760 --> 02:36.680]  on trial in the deaths of two transients in order to collect life insurance money. Prosecutors
[02:36.680 --> 02:42.920]  say the women took out policies on the two men and later killed them. The women allegedly
[02:42.920 --> 02:49.920]  collected $3 million in insurance money. For the latest news analysis, log on to ironnews.com.
[03:22.840 --> 03:27.600]  As the Merrimack River continues to rise, authorities in Eureka, Missouri working to
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.920]  protect that community, Lieutenant Nick Humphrey of the Missouri State Water Patrol.
[03:32.920 --> 03:37.040]  We are trying to start to move some of our personnel out of southeast Missouri and where
[03:37.040 --> 03:43.360]  the Merrimack River is supposed to crest at about 24 feet over flood stage, it would be
[03:43.360 --> 03:47.560]  the highest that that area has ever been. Asa, the situation is critical. We're trying
[03:47.560 --> 03:51.880]  to sandbag in all the locations where we think it might do some good but our concern is the
[03:51.880 --> 03:57.080]  levees and one of the levees of a sand boil which basically means that that levee is being
[03:57.080 --> 04:01.720]  eroded by flood waters. Since earlier this week, flooding in the Midwest claiming the
[04:01.720 --> 04:08.040]  lives of at least 16 people. Four men who were lost in a cave in the Great Smoky Mountains
[04:08.040 --> 04:13.280]  National Park have been safely rescued. Park Rangers began searching for the men after
[04:13.280 --> 04:19.360]  one of the wives reported them missing early Friday morning. A convicted sex offender is
[04:19.360 --> 04:26.040]  accused of murdering a 71-year-old Wisconsin real estate agent. Authorities say that James
[04:26.040 --> 04:34.440]  Holt had asked Ann Nelson to show him a home, then allegedly choked and beat her to death.
[04:34.440 --> 04:39.720]  Quite a week on Wall Street, ups and downs all over the place, but when it was done,
[04:39.720 --> 04:49.360]  the Down Dust Reels gained 410 points, NASDAQ up 45. I'm Jason Walker with news on IRN-USA

[06:12.840 --> 06:27.400]  Jones show. Call Alex now toll-free at 877-590-5525. Now live from Austin, Texas. Here's Alex
[06:27.400 --> 06:28.400]  Jones.
[06:28.400 --> 06:39.400]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome and thank you for joining us. It is Ishtar Day
[06:39.400 --> 06:45.480]  when we worship Ishtar, the mother goddess of Babylon and we simulate fertility through
[06:45.480 --> 06:53.080]  the rabbits. That's why Playboy Symbol is a rabbit because rabbits are well-known for
[06:53.080 --> 06:59.760]  their sexual stamina and how many cycles of young that they convert each year. Hence
[06:59.760 --> 07:05.400]  the terms like they're breeding like rabbits. That's why Hugh Hefner picked the rabbit as
[07:05.400 --> 07:12.840]  the symbol for his Playboy Empire. In the last 60 years, our children have been trained
[07:12.840 --> 07:19.760]  to not be Christian on this holiday, but for hundreds of years it's been called Easter,
[07:19.760 --> 07:25.240]  the occult symbolism hidden in plain view, the eastern worship of Ishtar, the mother
[07:25.240 --> 07:33.240]  goddess, fertility, the eggs, the rabbit, and it is a huge fertility ritual. We just
[07:33.240 --> 07:39.080]  had the beginning of spring a couple days ago and then we celebrate the high occult
[07:39.080 --> 07:45.920]  holy day practiced by different occult branches all over the world, from the Aztecs to the
[07:45.920 --> 07:55.240]  Babylonians, of course, to the Druids. Now, we did celebrate Ishtar today. We did put
[07:55.240 --> 08:01.560]  the eggs out. We did worship Ishtar. I'm not saying you're bad that you worship Ishtar.
[08:01.560 --> 08:07.840]  I'm just simply pointing out that like everything else, we need to be aware of what's happening.
[08:07.840 --> 08:15.560]  We need to be aware of what things really mean. Have you noticed that all the big holidays,
[08:15.560 --> 08:23.120]  Christmas, Halloween, you name it, they're all on occult, high holy days. Sowing, or
[08:23.120 --> 08:30.960]  what you know as Halloween in the Encyclopedia is the day all over Europe, the Druid, the
[08:30.960 --> 08:40.520]  sacrifices, the European slang in Germany and England for bone fire, that's a national
[08:40.520 --> 08:46.000]  geographic, when they would take men, women, and children and throw them into fire to pits.
[08:46.000 --> 08:53.840]  Now again, I'm a Christian and the kids have fun with the eggs and the whole point is that
[08:53.840 --> 08:59.440]  I don't worship Ishtar because I'm conscious of it and I realize what it is. But the globalists
[08:59.440 --> 09:05.120]  enjoy tricking you. They enjoy manipulating you. They enjoy having things hidden in plain
[09:05.120 --> 09:10.840]  view. In fact, that's part of their illuminous religion is that they get more power out of
[09:10.840 --> 09:18.000]  things being in plain view and you're still not seeing them. So that's all part of the
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.360]  basic craziness. But just look up the term Easter. It's in your Encyclopedia. The root
[09:23.360 --> 09:31.840]  from Ishtar, the goddess of fertility and in springtime, all over the world, different
[09:31.840 --> 09:36.280]  cultures, they had different names for the goddess, but it was always the goddess, would
[09:36.280 --> 09:41.640]  engage in different sacrifices, sometimes a goat, sometimes a ram, sometimes a bull,
[09:41.640 --> 09:47.680]  sometimes a horse, but more often than not, a child. And the Aztecs and the whole Mayan
[09:47.680 --> 09:54.240]  culture from Central America up into Southern North America in Mexico, they would sacrifice
[09:54.240 --> 10:03.840]  their children on this holy day. So just remember that and understand that and then ask yourselves
[10:03.840 --> 10:08.920]  why you're not told that. You didn't know Ishtar symbolizes a rabbit. You didn't know
[10:08.920 --> 10:14.040]  Easter means Ishtar. You didn't know that the Bible says that Christ reportedly rose
[10:14.040 --> 10:20.000]  on a different date than this day. None of that matters though. We do have the bunny,
[10:20.000 --> 10:28.880]  rabbit. Maybe, maybe, maybe that's Christian. Maybe Ishtar will take good care of us. My
[10:28.880 --> 10:32.680]  whole point is you should be aware of the hidden things that are hidden in plain view
[10:32.680 --> 10:37.480]  as I just said five times in a row. Okay, this is going to be a weird radio show today
[10:37.480 --> 10:43.360]  and you're not going to want to miss it. Just in the last three days, a whole bunch of weird
[10:43.360 --> 10:50.400]  news has come out. Now, most of this is news that you as listeners here are already aware.
[10:50.400 --> 10:57.160]  But what's what's crazy is that more and more mainstream outlets are admitting these things.
[10:57.160 --> 11:03.200]  I think that cameras in thousands of school district bathrooms in the bathrooms is Orwellian
[11:03.200 --> 11:11.040]  1984 being videotaped while you use the bathroom is the height of the destruction of privacy
[11:11.040 --> 11:16.880]  and of totalitarian control. But many of you have been conditioned that that is a good
[11:16.880 --> 11:21.440]  thing to have cameras in the girl showers and the boys showers and in the bathrooms.
[11:21.440 --> 11:26.240]  I'm not kidding all over the country. Wired into the police department as well and then
[11:26.240 --> 11:30.240]  hooked into federal databases. Many of you think having your cell phone tracked down
[11:30.240 --> 11:35.760]  to three feet by GPS under federal law that the police can type in your code. All cities
[11:35.760 --> 11:39.280]  haven't adopted this yet, but the feds offer it and then track your cell phone in live
[11:39.280 --> 11:43.640]  time where you're at. What you're doing, they type in a code, even if your cell phone's
[11:43.640 --> 11:48.080]  off and the audio comes up, designed by law to track and listen to you and the feds now
[11:48.080 --> 11:51.560]  admit that. I told you 10 years before it was in the news, but we talked about that
[11:51.560 --> 11:56.360]  last week. I seem to think that's big brother in a violation of the Fourth Amendment. But
[11:56.360 --> 11:59.680]  here in the land of the slaves, some of the cowards, a lot of people think that's what
[11:59.680 --> 12:07.000]  America is all about. But a big security company is working with the airlines to make you fit
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.320]  a taser bracelet around your wrist. Everyone who gets on a plane will be fitted with a
[12:12.320 --> 12:18.040]  taser bracelet and zapped if they have their way. And they say they've done polling and
[12:18.040 --> 12:22.360]  the people want to be fitted with your taser bracelet. And again, this is about training
[12:22.360 --> 12:27.040]  you to be a slave, making you take your shoes off. And I've got the federal docs on that,
[12:27.040 --> 12:30.880]  about humiliation, about setting the precedent for you to do anything and everything. This
[12:30.880 --> 12:35.600]  is all part of a dog training, basically. Pavlovian training to train you how to be
[12:35.600 --> 12:41.400]  a slave. But we're going to play this clip coming up after the break, where they're advertising
[12:41.400 --> 12:46.080]  the fact that you'll all be fitted with your zappers. Everyone will have their, and then
[12:46.080 --> 12:50.320]  they say, oh, by the way, in the real world, outside the airports, we can all have these
[12:50.320 --> 12:55.280]  zapper bracelets. And the police in LA are pushing and then they've done it in some cities
[12:55.280 --> 12:59.440]  where your car has to have an automatic kill switch for the police. Because, see, somebody
[12:59.440 --> 13:03.520]  might run from them, so we're all guilty until proven innocent, so we all got to have a kill
[13:03.520 --> 13:07.960]  switch in our car. Of course, who's going to watch the government? Who historically
[13:07.960 --> 13:11.840]  is the most dangerous thing we have to look out for? It doesn't matter. Automatic kill
[13:11.840 --> 13:18.280]  switches in cars will all be fitted with our taser bracelets or necklaces. Again, you
[13:18.280 --> 13:24.520]  can't make this up. You can't make this up. This is not a spoof for satire. You'll laugh
[13:24.520 --> 13:28.040]  and say it's not true today, but when you hear about it on the news next month, you
[13:28.040 --> 13:33.600]  will in double things shift and say, okay, I'm for it. That's how you've been pre-programmed
[13:33.600 --> 13:37.720]  with high tech mind control of the television that then leaks out into the culture and
[13:37.720 --> 13:43.600]  then is amplified by the cultural zeitgeist known as the peer pressure 100th monkey nexus
[13:43.600 --> 13:49.440]  overdrive. Little term I just coined there, but that's basically what it is. I told you
[13:49.440 --> 13:54.160]  about this 10 years ago again when I first learned I've had congressmen on, Australian
[13:54.160 --> 14:03.160]  parliamentarians on in all major Western governments. Europe has been doing it for 35 years. Australia,
[14:03.160 --> 14:09.360]  the US, England, Canada, and New Zealand. New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the US, and
[14:09.360 --> 14:15.120]  England, but the entire West for the last decade at least. At birth, your DNA is taken
[14:15.120 --> 14:21.920]  illegally and put in a DNA database, but I thought I would take this time today to report
[14:21.920 --> 14:27.120]  how the government is now announcing this. It's always been illegal and criminal and
[14:27.120 --> 14:36.360]  just totally wicked, but now they're admitting it and they're saying that your baby's blood
[14:36.360 --> 14:43.680]  is then diagrammed, a coding laid out, your DNA sequence, and then it goes to the Department
[14:43.680 --> 14:51.480]  of Homeland Security. That's right, your baby at birth is put into a federal DNA crime
[14:51.480 --> 14:58.640]  database. Cameras in bathroom stalls, DNA databases for babies, they want to fit us
[14:58.640 --> 15:03.520]  all with taser bracelets, all of us when we get on the plane. That is land of the slaves
[15:03.520 --> 15:08.480]  home of the cowards because they say, they say they pull people in focus groups and
[15:08.480 --> 15:13.480]  yes, put a taser around me in case there's a terrorist on the plane and then taser us
[15:13.480 --> 15:19.080]  home if there's a terrorist attack, there's a terrorist everywhere. Oh, but I'm not done.
[15:19.080 --> 15:23.280]  I told you about a year and a half ago that Google proudly has announced that the camera
[15:23.280 --> 15:28.400]  in your computer and microphone is watching you. Now Comcast is announcing it publicly
[15:28.400 --> 15:32.560]  and saying, what's the big deal? We're going to watch you in your home. And to show your
[15:32.560 --> 15:37.080]  conditioning and brainwashing, right now you're thinking I'm weird for saying a camera watching
[15:37.080 --> 15:55.560]  you in your home is big brother. We'll be right back slaves. It is a big idea, a new
[15:55.560 --> 16:12.440]  world order. For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth
[16:12.440 --> 16:21.240]  of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[16:21.240 --> 16:26.680]  Over the first time in history, the elites plan for world government is blown wide open.
[16:26.680 --> 16:30.480]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[16:30.480 --> 16:56.520]  It's like nothing else on earth from the Romans through the Renaissance from the industrial
[16:56.520 --> 17:02.680]  age to the space age. Gold has weathered the test of time. For 6,000 years, gold has remained
[17:02.680 --> 17:07.280]  the ultimate store of wealth. According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint, demand
[17:07.280 --> 17:12.160]  is at an all time high. The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common
[17:12.160 --> 17:17.680]  sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day. Midas Resources

[18:33.840 --> 18:38.240]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous

[18:52.120 --> 18:56.760]  It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United
[18:56.760 --> 19:01.080]  States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue, with never ending
[19:01.080 --> 19:05.480]  late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates. It has become mathematically
[19:05.480 --> 19:10.360]  impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors. The Federal Debt
[19:10.360 --> 19:14.960]  Relief System has created a successful attorney backed program to legally eliminate credit
[19:14.960 --> 19:18.620]  card debt, personal loans, lines of credit and other unsecured debts which have been
[19:18.620 --> 19:23.080]  fraudulently created by the banks. We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months
[19:23.080 --> 19:27.040]  with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report. Join the
[19:27.040 --> 19:30.640]  thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally
[19:30.640 --> 19:34.520]  eliminated their debt. Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to
[19:34.520 --> 19:36.520]  take action and turn your life around.

[20:09.320 --> 20:17.080]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. It's Ishtar Jay. Remember that fellow in Palestine named
[20:17.080 --> 20:26.840]  Jesus Christ by putting out purple, green and pink Easter eggs and hopping around. Imagine
[20:26.840 --> 20:33.840]  if somebody fell asleep 50 years ago and just now woke up on a cryo freeze and turned on
[20:33.840 --> 20:38.520]  the news and they were proposing that we all walk around wearing shock bracelets if it
[20:38.520 --> 20:42.920]  makes the officer feel more relaxed shouldn't the entire public be fitted with a shock of
[20:42.920 --> 20:53.040]  bracelets. Oh, yeah. I'm definitely Al Qaeda because I don't want to wear my shock bracelet.
[20:53.040 --> 21:02.280]  The government's good. The men in black ski mask are good. Everything is fine, my friends.
[21:02.280 --> 21:09.720]  You know what? Let's just go ahead and get into this now. This is actually very serious.
[21:09.720 --> 21:15.840]  Here inside the good old New World Order, this is a story from LRC Blong. Will the militarized
[21:15.840 --> 21:19.680]  police state shock you into submission? I would have had the headline. I'm trying to
[21:19.680 --> 21:23.920]  get Paul Watson to write an article for PrisonPlanet.com tomorrow on this, but integrating all the
[21:23.920 --> 21:31.120]  craziness that's happening with a headline like, Airlines Considering Forcing All Passengers
[21:31.120 --> 21:39.360]  To Wear Taser Shock Bracelets. I mean, that's really what they're doing. It says this is
[21:39.360 --> 21:44.480]  perhaps one of the most kooky and creepy security state tactics that I have come across. The
[21:44.480 --> 21:49.720]  EMD safety bracelet. It's called a safety bracelet, which is being billed as the last
[21:49.720 --> 21:55.320]  line of defense. A company called Lamperd Firearm Training Systems is trying to commercialize
[21:55.320 --> 22:00.080]  this item as an airline security product. The company's video that hawks the device,
[22:00.080 --> 22:04.040]  talks about current facial recognition called biometrics, where cameras capture photos
[22:04.040 --> 22:07.600]  of people and it goes through it. So I Googled the company and looked into it, and they've
[22:07.600 --> 22:12.400]  been doing consultations for some airlines, and they are considering it. The airlines
[22:12.400 --> 22:16.240]  are talking about, well, if you're on a watch list, there's over a million Americans now
[22:16.240 --> 22:20.880]  on the watch list, bad credit, ever had a misdemeanor, anything, you're on the list,
[22:20.880 --> 22:24.800]  and they're going to say, would you mind wearing this bracelet? That's how they always integrate
[22:24.800 --> 22:30.480]  it first. And then you're walking around with your shock bracelet. But let's go ahead and
[22:30.480 --> 22:37.000]  roll just a few minutes of the sales pitch, so the slaves out there can do this to be
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.640]  safe. See, it's all about being safe. Oh, they're building FEMA camps and getting rid
[22:41.640 --> 22:46.480]  of the Bill of Rights, so you're safe. Oh, there, none of this makes you safe. The greatest
[22:46.480 --> 22:50.480]  threat to you and your family is the government. Always has been, always will be throughout
[22:50.480 --> 22:54.200]  history and into the future. Let's go ahead and roll this now.
[22:54.200 --> 22:59.840]  Is there a solution to deterring hijackers once they are on the aircraft? Yes, there
[22:59.840 --> 23:07.840]  is a very viable workable answer. It starts here when passengers are issued their tickets.
[23:07.840 --> 23:12.920]  At that time, they can also be fitted with a special electronic ID bracelet that they
[23:12.920 --> 23:18.560]  will wear until they disembark the flight at their destination. These electronic coated
[23:18.560 --> 23:23.960]  bracelets will make traveling much more convenient for the public. It will replace the need to
[23:23.960 --> 23:29.920]  carry a ticket by containing all pertinent passenger information. In addition, the bracelet
[23:29.920 --> 23:36.640]  could permit tracking of the passenger through the terminal, including carry-on luggage.
[23:36.640 --> 23:43.080]  Checked luggage can be coded to match the bracelet to ensure no tampering or diversions. By further
[23:43.080 --> 23:48.840]  equipping each bracelet with EMD technology, the bracelets will allow crew members using
[23:48.840 --> 23:55.440]  radio frequency transmitters to quickly and effectively subdue hijackers. The electro-muscular
[23:55.440 --> 24:00.480]  disruption signal overrides the attacker's central nervous system and will render even
[24:00.480 --> 24:06.320]  the most elite and aggressive terrorist completely immobile for several minutes. This will allow
[24:06.320 --> 24:13.680]  the crew to subdue and handcuff that individual. EMD technology is designed to incapacitate
[24:13.680 --> 24:19.520]  a target from a safe distance without causing permanent injury, which means these criminals
[24:19.520 --> 24:26.240]  will survive and go to trial. The bracelet would only be armed by someone on board upon
[24:26.240 --> 24:31.280]  confirmation that a takeover situation exists.
[24:31.280 --> 24:37.600]  Oh, for some reason this YouTube clip is cutting out. I'll tell you, the computer is up here
[24:37.600 --> 24:41.680]  from like the 18th century. So hey, you know what, later we'll play the rest of the clip.
[24:41.680 --> 24:48.440]  That goes on and on. You can watch it up at infowars.com right now, our main news site
[24:48.440 --> 24:52.600]  and prismplanet.com has got a link to it too. But, you know, I shouldn't laugh about any
[24:52.600 --> 24:57.080]  of this. I shouldn't laugh about it because they're really considering this. You know,
[24:57.080 --> 25:02.960]  they made all the interdian general's employees in his office in Mexico City four years ago
[25:02.960 --> 25:08.560]  take microchips, implantable under the skin. They've made special forces take them and
[25:08.560 --> 25:12.120]  I was told this. I saw this in the news. They were considering it like five years ago, but
[25:12.120 --> 25:17.240]  I've had family who's now confirmed that has happened, that are in special forces. They're
[25:17.240 --> 25:22.600]  not supposed to talk about it either. In case you get blown in pieces, we can identify you.
[25:22.600 --> 25:26.840]  But it's all about control. And I mean, they'll probably propose next that at birth, we've
[25:26.840 --> 25:31.040]  got to have heart plugs put in where the police can just like pull a little string like in
[25:31.040 --> 25:35.400]  the movie Dune and rip a hole in your heart and have like a tube hanging out and, you
[25:35.400 --> 25:40.440]  know, see your blood pours out. It's for the officer's safety. Maybe they'll just like
[25:40.440 --> 25:44.400]  start planting a little explosive right in your carotid arteries and the cops can have
[25:44.400 --> 25:48.640]  like a little remote control and then you jay walk or back talk. They just hit a button
[25:48.640 --> 25:56.360]  and blows up your, you know, arteries explode. Kind of like an escape from New York. Snake
[25:56.360 --> 26:00.840]  Plissken folks, you know, I decided not to rant and rave and scream about this today.
[26:00.840 --> 26:08.600]  Let's just laugh at it. But they did internal focus groups in polling and found that about
[26:08.600 --> 26:14.320]  half people say they want to wear taser bracelets. I mean, let me tell you something cowardly
[26:14.320 --> 26:18.200]  cattle out there who like all of this. I'm not talking about everybody, but the percentage
[26:18.200 --> 26:22.800]  out there that loves it. You're never going to be safe. Okay. In fact, if you are a bunch
[26:22.800 --> 26:30.400]  of jellyfish, spineless, quizzling cowards that worship all authority and then run around
[26:30.400 --> 26:37.320]  hiding from men and turbines under the bed, you're going to be enslaved when wolves come
[26:37.320 --> 26:43.440]  when you act like a mindless lobotomized sheep. I mean, you're worse than sheep. At least
[26:43.440 --> 26:47.440]  sheep sometimes will run from a wolf. You're like a lobotomized sheep. It's had his legs
[26:47.440 --> 26:52.600]  cut off and shaved for ease of access for the wolves. So that's a bite through your,
[26:52.600 --> 26:59.360]  your wool. It's like a shaved sheep on its back with its legs cut off. And so it doesn't
[26:59.360 --> 27:05.920]  have to be scared or see anything. It's got blinders on earmuffs on and its mouth is muzzled
[27:05.920 --> 27:10.060]  in case it accidentally flailing and pain might bite the wolf. And the wolf comes running
[27:10.060 --> 27:14.160]  up in a black ski mask saying, I'm from Homeland Security. I'm here to keep you safe and you,
[27:14.160 --> 27:19.080]  you can't even hear them. You just start worshiping them. That's pretty much what this country's
[27:19.080 --> 27:26.640]  become. When we get back, we're going to be taking phone calls at 877-590-5525 states
[27:26.640 --> 27:32.000]  hand over the DNA of newborns to Department of Homeland Security. I want to spend some
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.920]  time on this. All of your children, 35 or younger, you've been put in a legal international
[27:37.920 --> 27:42.880]  database. Now you're conditioning just kicked in. You went, wait a minute, Homeland Security,
[27:42.880 --> 27:48.400]  six years old. I know that. I'm going to read the actual documents. This is real. That blood,
[27:48.400 --> 27:52.000]  they say, goes to the health department for a blood test. Did you ever ask why the, why
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.960]  the hospital couldn't do a blood test? Your blood publicly went to a federal database
[27:56.960 --> 28:02.760]  and then to an international database. Okay, for DNA testing, DNA backgrounds, they claim
[28:02.760 --> 28:08.880]  they own your child's blood. They make DNA patents out of it, new proteins and things.
[28:08.880 --> 28:14.580]  But now it goes to Homeland Security in the national crime database with murderers, bank
[28:14.580 --> 28:16.080]  robbers, everything else.
[28:16.080 --> 28:27.080]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
[28:27.080 --> 28:30.960]  you want to be slaves, you're going to get to be. And I want to tell the cops something.
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.440]  You think you're on the winning team? Just drink more fluoride water from your masters.
[28:34.440 --> 28:39.800]  Inject your children with mercury filled shots. Just trust the system. Go ahead, serve it,
[28:39.800 --> 28:46.800]  let it. We'll come back with a DNA databases in your cable boxes watching you.

[29:53.600 --> 29:57.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention. Ron Paul did not quit. He is still in the
[29:57.920 --> 30:02.960]  race. Most Americans do not understand how the election process works. The media is
[30:02.960 --> 30:08.280]  denying. John McCain does not have the Republican nomination. The popular vote is just a straw
[30:08.280 --> 30:13.440]  poll, believe it or not. The delegates have the power over the elections, not the voters.
[30:13.440 --> 30:17.240]  After the mainstream media wrote a hit piece on how Ron Paul quit, many supporters quit
[30:17.240 --> 30:21.960]  as well. Ron Paul has stated he will continue his run for presidency, as long as he has
[30:21.960 --> 30:27.080]  your continued support. Ron Paul has a plan, the delegates have not yet been voted on,
[30:27.080 --> 30:31.720]  and they are voted first in county, then state, all the way to the national convention. Go
[30:31.720 --> 30:38.240]  to our website at RonPaulFlags.com and click on why Ron Paul will win. That's RonPaulFlags.com
[30:38.240 --> 30:42.760]  to find out more on how delegates work. Stand your ground, go for the win and fly a Ron
[30:42.760 --> 30:52.520]  Paul flag today, or call 731-664-1526 for more information. That's 731-664-1526.

[33:09.240 --> 33:13.880]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen. You know, when I talk about the government being
[33:13.880 --> 33:18.880]  corrupt, the government being out of control, I don't mean the average cop, the average
[33:18.880 --> 33:28.320]  fireman, the average tax assessor, the average bureaucrat who's studying water samples, a
[33:28.320 --> 33:33.040]  lot of good people in government. But the structure of it, who runs it, how it operates. Here's
[33:33.040 --> 33:38.820]  an example. It has come out that a secret branch of the British government has been
[33:38.820 --> 33:43.440]  spying on all members of parliament for decades and tapping their phones and tapping their
[33:43.440 --> 33:48.520]  parliamentary phones. Again, the military industrial complex, the private banks, the
[33:48.520 --> 33:54.400]  arms manufacturers have taken over every western government. They run us at their pleasure
[33:54.400 --> 33:59.800]  and then they only have the illusion or simulated liberty, simulated free market, simulated
[33:59.800 --> 34:05.280]  capitalism, simulated voting. That's why they don't care about me being on the air. In fact,
[34:05.280 --> 34:09.080]  I've been told by some of them when I've talked to globalists before, they just laugh and
[34:09.080 --> 34:14.200]  say, we don't care if the slaves know. We don't, you know, these people don't want your
[34:14.200 --> 34:18.200]  help, Mr. Jones. I've talked to big corporate chiefs as you name it. They say, Alex, these
[34:18.200 --> 34:22.000]  people don't want your help. Look, you tell them and they don't want it. Of course it's
[34:22.000 --> 34:29.400]  all true. See, that's why I was laughing earlier, was to show you how they're laughing at you.
[34:29.400 --> 34:33.120]  And look, you're always going to have boss hogs and good old boys and corruption. What
[34:33.120 --> 34:39.120]  I don't like is that they put poison in the water knowingly for eugenics to dumb down
[34:39.120 --> 34:42.800]  their competition and they say it's to dumb down the middle class who might get in the
[34:42.800 --> 34:50.440]  way of their plan or the fact that they knowingly by the twenties had isolated cancer viruses
[34:50.440 --> 34:54.040]  and they started putting them in the vaccines or that they've sterilized women forcibly
[34:54.040 --> 34:58.680]  all over the planet or that our government paid China hundreds of billions of dollars
[34:58.680 --> 35:06.040]  in the aggregate over time to forcibly sterilize and have a one-child policy. I mean, that's
[35:06.040 --> 35:12.280]  hardcore. Now, I remember when I first got on air about 13 years ago, getting emails
[35:12.280 --> 35:18.000]  first out of Australia and it was a supposed table company installer and he got into one
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.680]  of the cable boxes and had a camera and microphone in it and I got on air and I said, that's
[35:22.680 --> 35:29.360]  a hoax. That story's not true. Turned out I was wrong. I mean, 13 years ago, I was the
[35:29.360 --> 35:33.080]  Federal Reserve is private. We need to get rid of it and we need the second amendment.
[35:33.080 --> 35:38.760]  I was kind of like a Ron Paul style Republican, but still pretty mainline. But then over the
[35:38.760 --> 35:42.880]  years, I found out all this stuff was true. I remember in 1996, getting on the radio
[35:42.880 --> 35:48.080]  and saying, you guys are cooks that believe in black helicopters. They don't exist.
[35:48.080 --> 35:52.040]  And it's something the media just throws out there to make us all look dumb. Let's talk
[35:52.040 --> 35:58.400]  about serious issues. Then they started attacking towns all over Texas. I went and witnessed
[35:58.400 --> 36:02.560]  it. I went and interviewed police chiefs who they tried to bribe emergency managers
[36:02.560 --> 36:08.040]  like Thomas Sanchez in Kingsville when they came to him and said it's PDD 25. We're gearing
[36:08.040 --> 36:14.280]  up for martial law. And then it was in the front page of the statesman, remember? Army
[36:14.280 --> 36:18.440]  terrorizes South Texas. Remember the headline? But then next to it, a big column saying conspiracy
[36:18.440 --> 36:23.000]  theorist Alex Jones doesn't like it. They admitted it was all happening, but then said,
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.120]  but still your conspiracy theorist, if you don't like it, people said, well, then I'm
[36:26.120 --> 36:32.520]  all for it. Those helicopters don't exist even when the paper says that they do. See,
[36:32.520 --> 36:39.920]  this is basic psychological warfare they're using on. And then, and I remember in 98,
[36:39.920 --> 36:44.080]  it was in the San Antonio Express news that they came into the police chief, a Delta force.
[36:44.080 --> 36:48.520]  They had big bags of cash. They tried to buy off the mayor. Everybody else, they were able
[36:48.520 --> 36:52.960]  to buy off a bunch of people bags of cash. The police chief said this is illegal. He
[36:52.960 --> 36:57.040]  was former army intelligence himself. Good patriotic guy, Ali Philippus. I called him
[36:57.040 --> 37:01.640]  up. So I'd like to interview the chief from my local show on channel 10 and for the radio.
[37:01.640 --> 37:04.960]  I got in the car, drove down, went down to the police station, went upstairs, talked
[37:04.960 --> 37:08.600]  to him and he said, yeah, this is for martial law and I'm not going to be part of it. That
[37:08.600 --> 37:13.880]  interview is available. It's all over the web for free. It's in my film police day 2000.
[37:13.880 --> 37:17.360]  Just a police chief. Then we went to Alice, Texas, interviewed a police chief who admitted
[37:17.360 --> 37:22.400]  foreign troops were with them, but he was all for it. He said the foreign troops could
[37:22.400 --> 37:29.440]  know about their secret plan, but the citizens couldn't. But the emergency manager Kingsville
[37:29.440 --> 37:34.480]  said no. And they said, oh, it's okay, sir. We've seen your file. You were in the, uh,
[37:34.480 --> 37:40.040]  in intelligence in Vietnam. Mr Sanchez will let you see the plan. And it was PDD 25 Clinton's
[37:40.040 --> 37:44.440]  gun confiscation off. It was a training off. They do it to condition each city before they
[37:44.440 --> 37:48.720]  carry out the op in the future if it's ever needed. That way, when they actually attack
[37:48.720 --> 37:54.320]  your cities, uh, and take over your city halls where need be, you would have already seen
[37:54.320 --> 38:00.640]  it happen before in drills and everyone is acclimated to it. Now it's in PDD 51 Bush
[38:00.640 --> 38:05.960]  has reauthorized John Ward Defense Authorization Act openly says for taking over the states
[38:05.960 --> 38:10.680]  and fighting the American people in insurrection and rebellion. It's not our military. It's
[38:10.680 --> 38:16.040]  not our government anymore. Does that mean our young men and women in uniform didn't
[38:16.040 --> 38:20.160]  join for the right reasons? Does it not mean they're not brave? Does it not mean that that
[38:20.160 --> 38:25.680]  no, they're in a bad system? It's like German soldiers by and large weren't bad, but they
[38:25.680 --> 38:30.680]  were in a bad system. Most of them were compartmentalized. Maybe four or 5% of the German military
[38:30.680 --> 38:36.680]  was involved in death camps. I used to think that it was the Germans were lying at the
[38:36.680 --> 38:41.680]  end of World War Two when, when, uh, General Eisenhower made the German. I've seen the
[38:41.680 --> 38:45.880]  film of this made Germans haul the dead out of the camps and bury him. You see everybody
[38:45.880 --> 38:49.480]  throwing up. They have the townspeople out and the Germans were saying, we didn't know.
[38:49.480 --> 38:53.200]  Well, now I've read a lot of documents, read a lot of history books. They really didn't
[38:53.200 --> 38:58.160]  know. They're just like the average American. You don't know. You don't want to know. You
[38:58.160 --> 39:03.560]  don't want to believe. You don't want to know what's happening. I'll tell you who did know
[39:03.560 --> 39:07.360]  Arnold Schwarzenegger's daddy was running operations. We're arresting people in the
[39:07.360 --> 39:15.160]  entire sector. He knew he was part of it. That pig gets up on TV and always wears that Nazi
[39:15.160 --> 39:19.320]  belt buckle. I'm so sick of Schwarzenegger, but that's only the land of the cowards home
[39:19.320 --> 39:24.480]  of the slaves. Would you have a Nazi who said he admires Hitler, son of a top Nazi running
[39:24.480 --> 39:29.680]  the seventh largest economy in the world, but the Pentagon's paying compliance, mind
[39:29.680 --> 39:33.560]  control weapons. That's another mainstream article. We're going to be going over. Uh,
[39:33.560 --> 39:38.040]  but you know what? Let me just go ahead and before we go to break and come back and take
[39:38.040 --> 39:42.840]  your calls. Let me just go ahead and get into the cable boxes first. Then we'll take calls.
[39:42.840 --> 39:48.560]  And then I'm going to get into, um, the DNA database. Your child is in a Homeland Security
[39:48.560 --> 39:54.040]  criminal database. Even if your child is 10 years old and Homeland Security didn't exist
[39:54.040 --> 39:59.400]  then, they have now gone back and gotten all the blood samples the feds took illegally
[39:59.400 --> 40:04.280]  at your child when your child was born and the hospital, compliant Lee and cowardly went
[40:04.280 --> 40:10.240]  along with, and that's now in the federal DNA database. But I thought I'd get into this
[40:10.240 --> 40:16.520]  first about year and a half, actually about two years ago. Now, maybe longer, you can
[40:16.520 --> 40:21.640]  go pull up the present planet article about it. Google put out a press release and said,
[40:21.640 --> 40:25.400]  we've been testing this for years, but now we're going ahead with it. Most computers
[40:25.400 --> 40:30.760]  have built in microphones and cameras and, uh, you know, you use it for video conferencing,
[40:30.760 --> 40:35.000]  but it's two way and we're just going to have a piece of software preloaded when you use
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.880]  us or we're working on deals. And they said, yahoo has their own system and Microsoft has
[40:39.880 --> 40:45.120]  their own system, but our systems better now Microsoft owns yahoo, but back then they didn't.
[40:45.120 --> 40:48.960]  And so they even talk about everybody else has the same system, but ours is a little
[40:48.960 --> 40:54.080]  bit better. And they said that computers with keywords are recording everything going on
[40:54.080 --> 41:01.200]  your house with the microphone and the video camera, either or, or both. And it said that
[41:01.200 --> 41:06.360]  if your dog is barking, they know to flash and, and, and even sell your name and send
[41:06.360 --> 41:13.760]  you junk mail for the dog barking for, for foods or toys or products for pets. They even
[41:13.760 --> 41:17.560]  know what TV show you're watching in the background and then they know how to tailor ads. You
[41:17.560 --> 41:22.400]  wonder why the TV show you like, those ads pop up on Google when you're on the computer.
[41:22.400 --> 41:26.400]  How do they know that? A lot of times it's not just cookies. The computer is listening
[41:26.400 --> 41:34.480]  to you and it is with, with, with the same NSA keyword technology, it's typing out everything
[41:34.480 --> 41:40.760]  you say. And then the whole of that data is then analyzed and put into your file. And
[41:40.760 --> 41:45.480]  they brag about this. They have an entire psychological algorithm, everything about you, what your
[41:45.480 --> 41:49.960]  true habits are, what you're really into, not just what you visit, what you do online,
[41:49.960 --> 41:55.200]  what happens in your home. And then they said, but don't worry, humans aren't actually listening.
[41:55.200 --> 42:00.160]  The computers are just creating files on you. And then humans look at that. Imagine if somebody
[42:00.160 --> 42:05.020]  came to your door and knocked on it and said, I'll pay you $1,000 a month to put cameras
[42:05.020 --> 42:12.520]  all over your house and to listen to you and you'd say, no, unless you were some exhibitionist.
[42:12.520 --> 42:16.840]  And don't they make tens of thousands of months? Those women, you, you'd say, get off my porch
[42:16.840 --> 42:21.360]  pervert, but Google announces it and you go, Oh, I don't want to admit I'm in a tyranny.
[42:21.360 --> 42:26.160]  I'm going to make an instant yuppie crime stop double think motion from Orwellville.
[42:26.160 --> 42:33.080]  And I'm going to decide just to mentally ignore that. That's what cowards do. They make minute
[42:33.080 --> 42:38.680]  to minute cowardly decisions. So there's been a big new announcement about this, uh, Comcast.
[42:38.680 --> 42:55.640]  Let me get back. Stay with us. Terror storm, a history of government sponsored terror,
[42:55.640 --> 43:00.200]  loose change, final cut in game blueprint for global enslavement. The true story of the
[43:00.200 --> 43:05.440]  Bilderberg group, the late great USA, America, freedom to fascism. These are just a few of

[43:53.280 --> 43:58.440]  Hi, neighbor. We all know that knowledge is power. We've tried to give you knowledge
[43:58.440 --> 44:03.400]  to help you prepare for rough times. There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence
[44:03.400 --> 44:09.120]  on often dangerous food imports. You know about genetically poisoned food. Two-thirds
[44:09.120 --> 44:12.960]  of the food is disappearing with the bees, along with huge crop failures from all-time
[44:12.960 --> 44:19.680]  record water shortages. You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[44:19.680 --> 44:24.760]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us. Food control has been
[44:24.760 --> 44:30.600]  the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America. The only value
[44:30.600 --> 44:35.200]  of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply
[44:35.200 --> 44:44.600]  while you still have the freedom to choose. Call 800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com.
[44:44.600 --> 44:56.000]  Or call 800-409-5633. I am David, and if you wake up at night to urinate
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.360]  like I was, then you'll want to take advantage of this special risk-free offer. If you have
[45:01.360 --> 45:06.760]  dribbling, burning, or pain during or after urination, then you may have a condition known
[45:06.760 --> 45:12.640]  as benign prostate enlargement. This is potentially serious and can get worse with age, so get
[45:12.640 --> 45:17.640]  regular check-ups from your doctor and take advantage of this special risk-free offer
[45:17.640 --> 45:23.520]  on beta-prostate. Beta-prostate contains natural ingredients that help support a healthy prostate,
[45:23.520 --> 45:30.320]  and it contains 3,000 times more beta-sanosterols than ordinary salpalmetto, so it's powerful
[45:30.320 --> 45:35.000]  and it works. What's better is that beta-prostate is a healthy supplement, so you don't need
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.000]  a prescription for it, and it's risk-free. For your risk-free trial of beta-prostate,
[45:40.000 --> 45:52.280]  dial 1-800-457-9914. That's 1-800-457-9914. Try beta-prostate risk-free. That's 1-800-457-9914.
[45:52.280 --> 45:57.240]  We've all seen the Tornado device on TV and wondered if it really worked. I was also
[45:57.240 --> 46:03.720]  skeptical at first until we tested six Tornado units, and in every case, we got more miles
[46:03.720 --> 46:08.840]  per gallon and felt more power. Gasoline's expensive, so when we find something that
[46:08.840 --> 46:16.240]  saves us money, it just makes sense to get it. Call 800-500-8880 and order your Tornado
[46:16.240 --> 46:21.640]  unit today, or visit tornadoair.com.
[46:21.640 --> 46:27.800]  Oil is oil. Don't kid yourself. Technology makes better oils possible, like royal purple.
[46:27.800 --> 46:32.960]  Royal purple reduces friction and increases film strength. Go to royalpurple.com and you'll
[46:32.960 --> 46:39.320]  find independent test results from North Carolina and Oklahoma State. Not hype, just facts.

[46:51.600 --> 47:13.480]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[47:13.480 --> 47:21.160]  Out in the West Texas town of El Paso, I fell in love with a Mexican girl.
[47:21.160 --> 47:31.160]  The face-scanning cameras were wonderful and happy. I had a thumb scan to get in the bar.
[47:31.160 --> 47:37.160]  The police demanded a drug test, but I refused. They tazered me five times, and I had a heart
[47:37.160 --> 47:44.600]  attack and died. I had that article here. It's all part of being a slave, and I love
[47:44.600 --> 47:53.160]  it. It's so much fun, oh, please, beat me more. All right, I'll stop. This is the Easter
[47:53.160 --> 48:02.360]  Fun Show, you know? Wild America, wild and free. Face-scanning cameras everywhere, everything
[48:02.360 --> 48:14.560]  you do, track. But he gave her the drink filled with fluoride, and she collapsed in a coma
[48:14.560 --> 48:21.560]  of this maiden, down with his hand for the gun that he wore.
[48:21.560 --> 48:31.680]  That's enough, man. But I wasn't allowed to own a gun in America anymore, and I wasn't
[48:31.680 --> 48:35.600]  allowed to fight either. You know, in this country, the kids aren't allowed to play
[48:35.600 --> 48:41.200]  tag or dodgeball. Now they're bagging, now they're banning running during recess. Again,
[48:41.200 --> 48:47.960]  everything's prison. Police dogs in the schools, learning how to be prisoners. Look, I know
[48:47.960 --> 48:55.280]  we got Ronald Kyle, Jira, Ted Patrick. I'm going to get to all of you here, but I'm
[48:55.280 --> 49:00.620]  in a little bit of an obnoxious mood today. Okay, so you can go online, and a lot of news
[49:00.620 --> 49:05.040]  articles were written about it after Prison Planet broke the news, to be clear. A couple
[49:05.040 --> 49:09.720]  of years ago, Google puts out a press release on their website, and they brag about how
[49:09.720 --> 49:14.040]  they're going to use the cameras and microphones in computers to watch you track, you listen
[49:14.040 --> 49:20.040]  to you. And then on the surface, as if it's not bad enough, use it for marketing. It's
[49:20.040 --> 49:23.880]  okay, we're going to use it for marketing, listening to you inside your house. And of
[49:23.880 --> 49:28.480]  course, Google's really the NSA, and then their main headquarters is in the NASA headquarters.
[49:28.480 --> 49:32.560]  You didn't know that? Look into it, and I've had a top CIA expert on to admit the trillion
[49:32.560 --> 49:43.720]  NSA slash CIA front, originally run at MIT up in New England, up in Boston. But I already
[49:43.720 --> 49:47.400]  digress, they're really going to use it to track and trace and control and watch what
[49:47.400 --> 49:51.040]  you're doing, and tailor propaganda to find out what you're really thinking, what you're
[49:51.040 --> 49:59.200]  really saying. Very sophisticated. But we reported on it, and then a bunch of publications
[49:59.200 --> 50:04.160]  reported on it, and attacked us and said, yeah, Google's going to do this, but Prison
[50:04.160 --> 50:10.160]  Planet, I mean, major computer websites, and said, but Prison Planet is still bad for
[50:10.160 --> 50:14.400]  not liking it. It's not the people listening to you without asking or without permission.
[50:14.400 --> 50:20.800]  You know, it's those that don't like it. We're a bunch of cooks. That's the same thing out
[50:20.800 --> 50:31.640]  of a very large TV review website that tracks the whole industry, and that's newtv.com.
[50:31.640 --> 50:36.080]  Comcast cameras to start watching you. I did some Googling and found out this is the case.
[50:36.080 --> 50:41.600]  If you have some tinfoil handy, see, see, just a report on this, though we have to say we're
[50:41.600 --> 50:46.440]  bad. Just a report, they're saying it, we're still bad and need tinfoil. See, you're still
[50:46.440 --> 50:50.960]  bad to even talk about it. They're going to do it, but they use psychological warfare
[50:50.960 --> 50:56.720]  tactics here, but we're, we're kooky to talk about it now, okay? So don't say no. Don't
[50:56.720 --> 51:00.200]  call the cable company and say, oh no, I don't want this to happen, because you're kooky
[51:00.200 --> 51:06.560]  if you say no, you see. So just go along with it. You've got to keep up appearances. It's
[51:06.560 --> 51:14.000]  not hyacin' bucket, it's hyacin' bouquet. That's a little inside joke for those who've
[51:14.000 --> 51:20.120]  seen that stupid show. Comcast cameras to start watching you. If you have some tinfoil handy,
[51:20.120 --> 51:25.800]  now might be a good time to fashion a hat. At the living, a digital living room conference
[51:25.800 --> 51:31.760]  today, Gerald Kunkel, I want to get him on, Comcast senior VP for user experience, told
[51:31.760 --> 51:36.480]  me the cable company is experimenting with different camera technologies built into devices
[51:36.480 --> 51:40.520]  so it can know who's in your living room. Now, Google talked about this too. They're
[51:40.520 --> 51:45.040]  all competing with each other. This is already going on, by the way. The idea being that
[51:45.040 --> 51:49.640]  if you turn on your cable box, it recognizes you and pulls up shows already in your profile
[51:49.640 --> 51:53.960]  or makes recommendations. If parents are watching TV with their children, for example, parental
[51:53.960 --> 51:58.640]  control, see, it protects the children, appear to block certain content from appearing on
[51:58.640 --> 52:03.400]  the screen. Kunkel also said this type of monitoring is the holy grail because it could
[52:03.400 --> 52:10.400]  help serve up specifically tailored ads. Yikes, see, that's on the screen will pop up ads
[52:10.400 --> 52:15.040]  just for you. And then, of course, if you let your kids watch R rated movies, child protective
[52:15.040 --> 52:19.320]  services will come grab them because they're going to report on you with the system. Toyota,
[52:19.320 --> 52:22.280]  it wants to come out with a camera watching you in your car. We'll tell you about that
[52:22.280 --> 52:27.240]  later. Kunkel said the system wouldn't be based on facial recognition, so there wouldn't
[52:27.240 --> 52:32.520]  be a picture of you on file. Oh, goodie. Instead, it would distinguish between different members
[52:32.520 --> 52:36.680]  of your household by recognizing body forms. He stressed that the system is still an experimental
[52:36.680 --> 52:41.960]  face. Yeah, remember three Super Bowls, almost four Super Bowls now. Janet Jackson had the
[52:41.960 --> 52:47.960]  wardrobe stage malfunction. The simulated wardrobe malfunction because it wasn't a malfunction,
[52:47.960 --> 52:56.280]  but it was simulated. So it made it okay. And then Tevo, which is a DVR system, said,
[52:56.280 --> 53:01.600]  oh, we had 2.3 million rewinds and replays. And the Chicago Tribune said, years after
[53:01.600 --> 53:05.000]  we'd already pointed this out, my point is that it didn't exist until they say it. They
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.920]  said, boy, how did you know? They go, oh, it's two way, not just with a camera, but
[53:08.920 --> 53:13.080]  your viewing habits, data, what you watch, what you do. They score each part of the show
[53:13.080 --> 53:17.960]  at different psychological points, knowing more than a psychiatrist giving you hundreds
[53:17.960 --> 53:25.000]  of tests could ever know. All going in a nice little file. Now, I remember when Time Warner
[53:25.000 --> 53:30.440]  it came out about eight years ago, or is it nine years ago, the guy was putting digital
[53:30.440 --> 53:34.040]  cable in at my house and he was a fan here locally. He said, you see this microphone?
[53:34.040 --> 53:38.320]  And I said, yeah. And he goes, well, that can listen to you. And that's two way. And
[53:38.320 --> 53:42.440]  I were told it's for marketing. And I didn't believe the guys who showed me the actual
[53:42.440 --> 53:46.720]  manual, the install, like not manual. I would get because I wouldn't getting it, the actual
[53:46.720 --> 53:50.920]  manual. Then I got all these mean calls from not Time Warner execs, but employees going,
[53:50.920 --> 53:55.880]  you liar, we don't do that. Those scientific Atlantic boxes. It's not just Time Warner.
[53:55.880 --> 53:59.240]  Scientific Atlantic supplies like half the boxes I was reading to the industry some years
[53:59.240 --> 54:04.120]  more, some years less. But here it is in the news now. Now they're coming out with cameras
[54:04.120 --> 54:08.520]  because see, it's also internet for you. So it's two way. You got to do video casting,
[54:08.520 --> 54:12.960]  video conferencing. It's in all the computer screens. It's built into the computers. This
[54:12.960 --> 54:16.920]  is the system. So I just thought you might want to be aware of this. By the way, the
[54:16.920 --> 54:23.480]  feds by about five years ago nationwide have license plate reading cameras up everywhere
[54:23.480 --> 54:27.280]  that track you in real time where you're going, what you're doing. That's all uploaded to
[54:27.280 --> 54:32.440]  the government. They now admit it. Face scanning cameras are up nationwide under federal control.
[54:32.440 --> 54:37.040]  Like I said, your cell phones track you down to three feet. Even when they're off Green
[54:37.040 --> 54:41.360]  Bay was the first city four years ago to announce or is it five now? It's in matrix of evil.
[54:41.360 --> 54:45.680]  I made that four years ago. It's about five years ago that the governor announced in Green
[54:45.680 --> 54:49.000]  Bay. He was there visiting with the city and they showed the emergency management center
[54:49.000 --> 54:53.120]  for the city. The feds had paid for with our tax money and they punched up people's names
[54:53.120 --> 54:57.880]  and in live time, it was tracking each cell phone in real time. That's going in nationwide.
[54:57.880 --> 55:02.080]  Most cities though, have it announced to the cops. They have to incrementally brainwash
[55:02.080 --> 55:06.960]  them to accept that the cops just types into his console and you pop up. I wonder where
[55:06.960 --> 55:13.560]  Alexander E. Jones is. I got his deep, you know, driver's license and number here. Oh,
[55:13.560 --> 55:19.480]  there he is. He is at Poke Joe's right now. We want to pick Alex Jones up. He is at the
[55:19.480 --> 55:24.960]  barbecue place. Land of the cowards, home of the slaves to be in a free country. You
[55:24.960 --> 55:31.320]  got to be free. We can't be America freedom and they're proposing. We wear taser bracelets.
[55:31.320 --> 55:35.880]  All of us are going to plane because in case I in case he guilty until proven innocent,
[55:35.880 --> 55:40.960]  let's give all our rights up to shadowy men are going to get us the shadowy men run our
[55:40.960 --> 55:47.920]  government. So that is the basics there. Comcast cameras to start watching you. Perhaps I'd
[55:47.920 --> 55:52.480]  seen any of the state too many times, or perhaps I just naive about the depth to which Comcast
[55:52.480 --> 55:58.080]  currently tracks my every move. I can't trust Comcast with BitTorrent. So why should I trust
[55:58.080 --> 56:05.800]  them with my must be kept secret DVR clogging addiction to keeping up with the Carter shans,
[56:05.800 --> 56:11.800]  whatever that is. Conkel also spoke on camera with me about fixing bad Comcast user experiences,
[56:11.800 --> 56:17.960]  the ongoing BitTorrent battle of VOD. But he mostly towed the corporate line on these issues.
[56:17.960 --> 56:22.280]  The monitoring of your living room came up after my camera was put away and then it just
[56:22.280 --> 56:28.320]  goes on and on. But don't just believe that news article. Go Google this and Google will
[56:28.320 --> 56:33.240]  brag to you how they've got the best system and y'all who's got a great system and they
[56:33.240 --> 56:37.720]  all are competing with who can watch you best in your house. Here's another one. This is
[56:37.720 --> 56:44.280]  out of the Oxford Mail out of Oxford. Customers, drinkers face drug checks. And it says customers
[56:44.280 --> 56:49.320]  were tested for drugs before they could go and get a pint of beer in an Oxford pub. About
[56:49.320 --> 56:55.800]  80 people were tested for drugs in the IT miser outside Blackbird. That's the device.
[56:55.800 --> 57:00.120]  And Blackbird lays last Friday night with the promise of more crackdowns to come. Two people
[57:00.120 --> 57:04.520]  were arrested, seven were searched, and a quantity of suspected cocaine was found police
[57:04.520 --> 57:11.320]  said. And if you think the government lets in, England has ironclad customs, total ironclad.
[57:11.320 --> 57:18.040]  And they shipped the cocaine in, by the way. But if you refuse to let them take a tissue
[57:18.040 --> 57:23.560]  swab and test it out of your cheek, they arrest you. See guilty until proven innocent under
[57:23.560 --> 57:28.560]  the thumb. And I know, don't believe me. Keep drinking your sodium fluoride water. Keep taking
[57:28.560 --> 57:38.840]  your laden injections filled with mercury. Go ahead and eat your GMOs and love your government.

[59:56.600 --> 1:00:01.560]  Iron-Inch proposals for delay and further reductions of U.S. troops in Iraq, at least
[1:00:01.560 --> 1:00:06.640]  until the end of the summer, have been presented to the Bush administration by senior military
[1:00:06.640 --> 1:00:12.040]  commanders. The New York Times reports those proposals would also limit deployments to
[1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:18.680]  12 months down from the current 15. Pentagon says a pause would provide more time to assess
[1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:24.360]  the impact of the withdrawals already completed. President Bush likely to make a decision about
[1:00:24.360 --> 1:00:30.480]  any additional withdrawals before he leaves for a trip to Ukraine, Romania, and Croatia
[1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:36.840]  on April 1st. Parts of the Midwest coping with heavy flooding, at least 16 people have

[1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:48.880]  make the situation even worse. This is IRN USA Radio News.

[1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:53.720]  Correspondent Abed Dutton says the state of California
[1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:57.720]  finding 11 hospitals because of mistakes made concerning medication.
[1:01:57.720 --> 1:02:01.720]  Kathleen Billingsley with the State Department of Health says the fines should
[1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:05.720]  serve as a wake-up call. It gives all health care delivery systems an
[1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:09.720]  opportunity to review this, to then go back, look at their own systems and processes
[1:02:09.720 --> 1:02:13.720]  to make sure that they have sales-safe processes in place.
[1:02:13.720 --> 1:02:17.720]  The hospitals were fined $25,000 for each penalty. The violations mostly involved
[1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:21.720]  prescribing the wrong type or dosage of medication. Health Department
[1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:25.720]  fined nine hospitals last October. Abed Dutton reporting.

[1:02:33.720 --> 1:02:37.720]  and Patty Murphy say allegations of cronyism and contracts
[1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:41.720]  that were improperly awarded are reason for Jackson to step down.
[1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:45.720]  They say because of this he cannot effectively do his job.

[1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:23.720]  Slots could be opening up on the United Nations' most powerful body. The Associated Press
[1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:27.720]  has obtained a proposal that suggests expanding the Security Council
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:31.720]  from 15 to 22 members. The catch is that it would be up to the
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:35.720]  190 member states to decide which countries should fill the posts. There is strong support
[1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:39.720]  to enlarge the Security Council to reflect changes in global world power structures
[1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:43.720]  since the body was created following World War II. Previous attempts
[1:03:43.720 --> 1:03:47.720]  which started in 1979 have failed. The Treasury Department is
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:51.720]  thinking small these days. Starting next month, individuals will be able to buy
[1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:55.720]  Treasury securities in amounts as low as $100. That's down from the
[1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:59.720]  current minimum of $1,000. The change will take effect for the weekly auction
[1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:03.720]  that will be held on April 7th. Since New York Governor Elliot Spitzer has
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:07.720]  fallen from grace in a prostitution scandal, questions have swore out as to whether he
[1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:11.720]  spent taxpayer money or campaign dollars to subsidize trips. An analysis
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:15.720]  from the AP shows little signs money was used for illicit
[1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:19.720]  activity. More from Moran Levinson. The Associated Press analyzed
[1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:23.720]  a year's worth of expense reports for Spitzer's office and his campaign for re-election.
[1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:27.720]  It found little sign that either was used to pay for the governor's assignations.
[1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:31.720]  Spitzer did a lot of traveling in his short time as governor, but nothing in the papers
[1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:35.720]  suggests any of those trips was taken for the purpose of meeting prostitutes or getting a
[1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:39.720]  hotel room. Spitzer could afford to use his own money. He's a wealthy man. Federal prosecutors
[1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:43.720]  have yet to take a position on the matter. At last report they were considering whether
[1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:49.720]  a file charges against the ex-governor. Moran Levinson, New York. This is IRN USA Radio News.
[1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:53.720]  It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks
[1:04:53.720 --> 1:04:57.720]  in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they
[1:04:57.720 --> 1:05:01.720]  issue. With never ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates,
[1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:07.720]  it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[1:05:07.720 --> 1:05:11.720]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney backed program to legally
[1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:15.720]  eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts
[1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:19.720]  which have been fraudulently created by the banks. We can terminate your unsecured debt
[1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:23.720]  within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.

[1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:31.720]  legally eliminated their debt. Instead of living each day in fear and frustration,

[1:06:31.720 --> 1:06:35.720]  The government, the criminals that run it look at your bank account without a warrant.
[1:06:35.720 --> 1:06:41.720]  They look at every prescription you get, regardless of what it is, anything
[1:06:41.720 --> 1:06:45.720]  in prescription. Every major police department put in the Austin Police
[1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:49.720]  Department, where I live, for decades look at your power bill
[1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:53.720]  to see how much power you're using and then they use that to get a warrant
[1:06:53.720 --> 1:06:57.720]  to swat team your house thinking you're growing dope.
[1:06:57.720 --> 1:07:01.720]  Half the time it's something else. They got helicopters
[1:07:01.720 --> 1:07:05.720]  look right through your walls for over a decade. Now they've got
[1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:09.720]  resident systems that have clear pictures of you inside your house and they can say we're doing it.
[1:07:09.720 --> 1:07:13.720]  We're going to fly over and film your neck in your house. They're going to walk you through the airports.
[1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:17.720]  A bunch of airports have these now that take high-tech digital photos through your clothes
[1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:21.720]  of your neck and body and put it in a database.
[1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:25.720]  They track your cell phone. I've been talking about this last hour. Now your cable boxes,
[1:07:25.720 --> 1:07:29.720]  your computers, the cameras built in and all the new models, they say they're already watching you
[1:07:29.720 --> 1:07:33.720]  and listening to you. The companies themselves are not just the NSA,
[1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:37.720]  but these companies basically are. Microsoft is a known government
[1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:41.720]  front, so is Google. When I've had top government people
[1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:45.720]  want to expose that. This is not a free market. It is a simulation
[1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:49.720]  of a free market. Private interest, own the Fortune 50
[1:07:49.720 --> 1:07:53.720]  who then have subdivisions and own the Fortune 500 and control it.
[1:07:53.720 --> 1:07:57.720]  And mostly NSA is used to steal patents and cheat
[1:07:57.720 --> 1:08:01.720]  other companies and make sure the free market doesn't win. And to stop the FBI
[1:08:01.720 --> 1:08:05.720]  and CIA from stopping government black ops to make sure this drug
[1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:09.720]  shipment gets busted and that drug shipment doesn't. Oh, there's a drug war
[1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:13.720]  on the competition of the banks. You try to ship drugs in this country and you're not
[1:08:13.720 --> 1:08:17.720]  affiliated with the globalists. It's not a major shipment. The major shipments
[1:08:17.720 --> 1:08:21.720]  just come in on trains, 18-wheelers and aircraft. They land a government aircraft.
[1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:25.720]  Military's their M16s garden it. Loaded right in, taken right out to your local mob,
[1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:29.720]  shipped right out to your family. And that's been
[1:08:29.720 --> 1:08:33.720]  an Esquire magazine, C-span everywhere else. People say, I don't believe
[1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:37.720]  the government is involved in the drugs. You don't believe much, do you?
[1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:41.720]  And I think Kennedy was shot once. And I think that bullet changed
[1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:45.720]  direction nine times and hit seven bones and wasn't even damaged.
[1:08:45.720 --> 1:08:49.720]  Alright, I'm going to shut up. I'm going to get into how they're taking
[1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:53.720]  your children's DNA at birth and putting it in the Homeland Security Database.
[1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:57.720]  Coming up after calls. We got Ronald, Kyle, Jira,
[1:08:57.720 --> 1:09:01.720]  Ted, Patrick, Kyle, I'm going to go to you all right now. Rob others. Ronald
[1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:05.720]  in Missouri. You're on the air, sir. Thanks for holding.
[1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:09.720]  I'm just evil because I don't like cameras in school bathrooms
[1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:13.720]  and cameras watching me. Yeah, I feel the same way.
[1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:17.720]  I just want to tell you some of the things that happen here. I got a call
[1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:21.720]  from the coordinator for the Ron Paul
[1:09:21.720 --> 1:09:25.720]  movement here in Missouri to go to a caucus.
[1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:29.720]  I never been to a caucus, so I went.
[1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:33.720]  Dang, if I didn't get into it. And I just wanted to show
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:37.720]  you, I got a copy of the Missouri State
[1:09:37.720 --> 1:09:41.720]  platform. And there's a lot of them. They're pretty
[1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:45.720]  good in there, but let's do this.
[1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:49.720]  We believe Missourians are safer, stronger, and more often
[1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:53.720]  optimistic with the Republic in the White House.
[1:09:53.720 --> 1:09:57.720]  And then it gets worse. We commend the efforts of our
[1:09:57.720 --> 1:10:01.720]  elected Republican officials in Congress. And then we
[1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:05.720]  commend President Bush for eight years of restoring real American
[1:10:05.720 --> 1:10:09.720]  values, integrity, credibility, vision, strength, and
[1:10:09.720 --> 1:10:13.720]  character. Can't put perfume on a pig. It's same with the Democrats. All bought and paid
[1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:17.720]  for. I know that it made me. It makes me. Our names destroyed.
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:21.720]  Our dollars destroyed. We're hated universally. The country's sinking into
[1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:25.720]  third world them. And they're just running around delusionally saying everything's wonderful.
[1:10:25.720 --> 1:10:29.720]  And another thing I wanted to mention, I really wanted to tell you how much
[1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:33.720]  I appreciated that 19th of March, a broadcast
[1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:37.720]  you give on the Second Amendment. The only thing is you didn't put it on
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:41.720]  like you did the 18th, and then you did the 20th. I
[1:10:41.720 --> 1:10:45.720]  downloaded the 19th, but I messed up on the first hour and
[1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:49.720]  let it go two minutes, two long, so it won't go on a CD. I
[1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:53.720]  wanted to give it to everybody that belongs to the Gun Club I belong to.
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:57.720]  You've got our podcast. You can't get it. Well, I got it. I just messed
[1:10:57.720 --> 1:11:01.720]  up, Alex. I let it go too long on the first. Well, I mean,
[1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:05.720]  do you need me to have that show posted on the website? Well, if you would
[1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:09.720]  boy, I appreciate it. You know, you got the 18th and you got
[1:11:09.720 --> 1:11:13.720]  the 20th on planetTV.tv. I'm a
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:17.720]  member of that one. Okay, we'll get them all up for you, my friend. I appreciate it.
[1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:21.720]  Great caller. Let's try to go to the next caller. Let's talk
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:25.720]  to Kyle in Oklahoma. Kyle, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:29.720]  Yes. To say, first of all, you are like the Paul Revere of the 21st
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:33.720]  century of my eyes. You are like a socially completely aware
[1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:37.720]  genius. No, I'm not. I'm a, look, it doesn't, you have to be a genius to know
[1:11:37.720 --> 1:11:41.720]  cameras in the cable boxes and school bathrooms and freedom. Yeah, and
[1:11:41.720 --> 1:11:45.720]  I wanted to talk about it too. Like, you know, the education
[1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:49.720]  and the way they run the school systems because, you know,
[1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:53.720]  I went to school and then, you know, I think it was 10th grade. That's when
[1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:57.720]  they started teaching you how to use drugs. You know, this is bad for you just like 40
[1:11:57.720 --> 1:12:01.720]  in psychology. No, no, they admit, and of course the cops doing it don't know this, but they admit that
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:05.720]  the DARE program increased drug use. Here's a bag of this. Here's a bag of that.
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:09.720]  Here's how you use it. But where I went to high school the first couple years in Rockwall,
[1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:13.720]  the police dealt the drugs and later went to prison for it. So, of course, they were there teaching us how to use
[1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:17.720]  their product. Right, yeah. And I was also
[1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:21.720]  you know, compared this whole like, uh, you know, time span to, uh,
[1:12:21.720 --> 1:12:25.720]  you know, 33 to 45 when the Hitler ran, you know, and a lot of people are
[1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:29.720]  comparing this to, you know, maybe like the third reach because
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:33.720]  the fourth right. The fourth right. I'm sorry. You know what you're talking about way more than I do.
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:37.720]  The fourth right. I just started waking up to this and I think it's time
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:41.720]  to, you know, start discussing solutions and
[1:12:41.720 --> 1:12:45.720]  I was going to ask you one question before I just wanted to say a little bit.
[1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:49.720]  Do you know about Rex 84? Well, that was the first massive FEMA
[1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:53.720]  camp program to put the American people in prison camps and bring us into
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:57.720]  total martial law. But it was in the embryonic phase. Then it came out in Senate hearings
[1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:01.720]  in 86. I've got clips of that in my film police state to the takeover.
[1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:05.720]  But now it's publicly announced that they have camps for about 30 million Americans.
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:09.720]  Okay. And if so, is it true too that, uh,
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:13.720]  like the same technology for the RFID is implemented by IBM
[1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:17.720]  and so is that? Yes. IBM did the Nazi computers.
[1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:21.720]  It was Thomas Watson was the top U.S. Nazi and then under him
[1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:25.720]  was the top designate officer of the Nazi party
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:29.720]  was Prescott Bush. That's New York Times, mainstream news from the 40s and 50s.
[1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:33.720]  And they developed the machines
[1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:37.720]  that, you know, the coded number they tattooed on you that was entered into
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:41.720]  the machine and the machine would decide off your age and weight whether to go ahead
[1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:45.720]  and kill you or to work you to death. And they would put your medical data
[1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:49.720]  into that first computer. And then it was used
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:53.720]  for that. And now IBM runs the National ID card system. They own the
[1:13:53.720 --> 1:13:57.720]  Plot Digital Solutions, the Impliable Microchip Company is their front.
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:01.720]  They're involved in the human genome, Cold Springs Harbor, they run that. IBM
[1:14:01.720 --> 1:14:05.720]  was founded for eugenics by eugenics. Microsoft is their front company
[1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:09.720]  trying to get around any trust laws. Bill Gates is their front. His dad's
[1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:13.720]  they had a Planned Parenthood. They run their block off that way. Nice little operation
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:17.720]  they run. We don't have time to get our call, do we? Let's jam one more in there.
[1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:21.720]  Let's talk to, let's talk to you. You're, I believe,
[1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:25.720]  in beautiful Mon, Tana, you're on the air.
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:29.720]  I'm at Uriah. Uriah, go ahead. Yeah.
[1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:33.720]  When I was going up to Canada with my dad, we saw about
[1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:37.720]  four helicopters just flying just real close to the ground.
[1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:41.720]  Those don't exist, sir.
[1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:45.720]  And then back up just on the highway.
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:49.720]  Highways don't exist, sir. Big, a lot of cops just all around
[1:14:49.720 --> 1:14:53.720]  running that operation. That's good. Keeping you safe. But if you say you
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:57.720]  don't like what they were doing, they don't exist. If you say you appreciate it and want to live in a police
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:01.720]  state, they do exist. You understand how that works, sir? Yeah. You've got to learn how
[1:15:01.720 --> 1:15:05.720]  to work like the average yuppie. A yuppie thinks as long as they claim in their own mind
[1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:09.720]  that they're winning and that they're on top of things that they are.
[1:15:09.720 --> 1:15:13.720]  That's a loser's creed, is that the analogy is somebody
[1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:17.720]  his business is falling apart. Their competition is kicking their butt. They'll say, oh, I'm like
[1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:21.720]  competition. They're in deep trouble. Anything else you want to add, sir?
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:25.720]  No. How are you listening to us in Montana?
[1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:29.720]  I'm normally listening on the internet. Well, we've got
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:33.720]  an affiliate up there, so we appreciate those folks up there. Anything else?
[1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:37.720]  Good to hear from you. I'm going to come back with the next segment. I'm going to rampage through Ted,
[1:15:37.720 --> 1:15:41.720]  Patrick, Kyle, Rob and Ted. Two different Ted's calls. And then
[1:15:41.720 --> 1:15:45.720]  we're going to get into how they're taking your children's blood
[1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:49.720]  for DNA databases because they say basically we're all Al-Qaeda.
[1:15:49.720 --> 1:15:53.720]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[1:15:53.720 --> 1:15:57.720]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:01.720]  government. It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:16:01.720 --> 1:16:05.720]  Is that their objective being world domination? For thousands of years
[1:16:05.720 --> 1:16:09.720]  their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of
[1:16:09.720 --> 1:16:13.720]  the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:16:13.720 --> 1:16:17.720]  of humanity is at hand.
[1:16:17.720 --> 1:16:21.720]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world
[1:16:21.720 --> 1:16:25.720]  government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire
[1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:29.720]  new world order agenda. Builder Bird is making great progress through the world
[1:16:29.720 --> 1:16:33.720]  order. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:37.720]  They're after power. Yes, they're after easy. Order in game on DVD

[1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:53.720]  Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force. Life is a gamble, but you can
[1:16:53.720 --> 1:16:57.720]  stack the deck. If you knew what I know about all the problems
[1:16:57.720 --> 1:17:01.720]  food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and
[1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:05.720]  dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[1:17:05.720 --> 1:17:09.720]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food
[1:17:09.720 --> 1:17:13.720]  is all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit,
[1:17:13.720 --> 1:17:17.720]  our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control
[1:17:17.720 --> 1:17:21.720]  of our own supply of food and enough of it. But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered
[1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:25.720]  you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out
[1:17:25.720 --> 1:17:29.720]  and getting a serious food supply. Decide it's food now
[1:17:29.720 --> 1:17:33.720]  or probably never, but can you afford to be wrong? Decide
[1:17:33.720 --> 1:17:37.720]  now. Place your bet. Can you afford to be wrong?

[1:17:49.720 --> 1:17:53.720]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered
[1:17:53.720 --> 1:17:57.720]  why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about
[1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:01.720]  gold for your IRA? That's right, gold has been available to be placed
[1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:05.720]  in IRAs since 1986, yet still, the financial
[1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:09.720]  industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:13.720]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments
[1:18:13.720 --> 1:18:17.720]  like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:21.720]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your
[1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:25.720]  assets by keeping you in paper. If you'd like to take a look at gold
[1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:29.720]  for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[1:18:29.720 --> 1:18:33.720]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:37.720]  Call 800-686-2237. Make sure
[1:18:37.720 --> 1:18:41.720]  that you secure your future. Call 800-686-2237.

[1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:53.720]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[1:19:53.720 --> 1:20:09.720]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[1:20:09.720 --> 1:20:13.720]  Yeah, I've got a syndicated radio trends mission reaching millions every week,
[1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:17.720]  Monday through Friday. But that's not enough for me.
[1:20:17.720 --> 1:20:21.720]  I get my butt in my car and I drive down to the studios of New Radio 590K,
[1:20:21.720 --> 1:20:25.720]  LBJ, and we jack into the satellites and
[1:20:25.720 --> 1:20:29.720]  blast out on the AM and FM dial. Communities across
[1:20:29.720 --> 1:20:33.720]  this country, chomplcast on the internet, shortwave worldwide.
[1:20:33.720 --> 1:20:37.720]  We're not giving up. We're not going down without a fight.
[1:20:37.720 --> 1:20:41.720]  Toe to Toe with the New World Order Scientific Dictatorship
[1:20:41.720 --> 1:20:45.720]  and the big egghead scientists at the top that work with the big old bankers,
[1:20:45.720 --> 1:20:49.720]  the robber barons, the black nobility of Europe, the Machiavellian system,
[1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:53.720]  Toe to Toe with dehumanization,
[1:20:53.720 --> 1:20:57.720]  110 percent, never back in the world, never
[1:20:57.720 --> 1:21:01.720]  surrendering. Yeah, it's not
[1:21:01.720 --> 1:21:05.720]  the kill, ladies and gentlemen. It's the thrill of the fight
[1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:09.720]  and I can smell blood. We're going to bring them down.
[1:21:09.720 --> 1:21:13.720]  They're afraid. They've tried to dumb you down
[1:21:13.720 --> 1:21:17.720]  and turn you into a bunch of nerds that understand the world really works
[1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:21.720]  but you're starting to wake up. You're starting to feel the freedom
[1:21:21.720 --> 1:21:25.720]  again and you're starting to wake up. Big Brother doesn't like
[1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:29.720]  that. He pop in there. That's a joke, folks. We're back
[1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:33.720]  live, my friends, and I am fired up today
[1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:37.720]  and I am extremely fired up today.
[1:21:37.720 --> 1:21:41.720]  Ah, man! It is normal
[1:21:41.720 --> 1:21:45.720]  to get angry about the government criminally, illegally
[1:21:45.720 --> 1:21:49.720]  and making your children's blood at birth and putting it in the homeland security criminal database.
[1:21:49.720 --> 1:21:53.720]  We're going to cover that after calls. Let's go ahead and take calls right now.
[1:21:53.720 --> 1:21:57.720]  Let's talk to Ted in North Carolina. Ted, you're on the year. Welcome.
[1:21:57.720 --> 1:22:01.720]  Alex, what's up, man? Got a couple of points I want to bring up.
[1:22:01.720 --> 1:22:05.720]  Number one, I did some research, a little bit of research,
[1:22:05.720 --> 1:22:09.720]  on the Aztecs and they talked about the year
[1:22:09.720 --> 1:22:13.720]  2012 being the end. Are you familiar with that? 2012,
[1:22:13.720 --> 1:22:17.720]  right. And I found out that
[1:22:17.720 --> 1:22:21.720]  supposedly there's this planet that comes around every 36 years.
[1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:25.720]  The Beirut. The Beirut or Planet X as it's referred to.
[1:22:25.720 --> 1:22:29.720]  And when it comes, basically it causes pole shifts,
[1:22:29.720 --> 1:22:33.720]  causes solar tempests and things of that nature.
[1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:37.720]  In addition, I found out about the Phil Snyder guy, the guy who was a
[1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:41.720]  government geologist whose job was to build these deep underground
[1:22:41.720 --> 1:22:45.720]  databases. I interviewed him.
[1:22:45.720 --> 1:22:49.720]  Yeah, about 10 years ago. Okay. Wow.
[1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:53.720]  And I was just like, man, that is crazy. I mean, have you, so obviously
[1:22:53.720 --> 1:22:57.720]  you're up on this. What are your thoughts on it? Well, I know
[1:22:57.720 --> 1:23:01.720]  this. You know, the Aztecs had incredible science.
[1:23:01.720 --> 1:23:05.720]  They had a calendar accurate for thousands of years. Our calendar
[1:23:05.720 --> 1:23:09.720]  isn't accurate even every couple dozen. That's what we have leap year.
[1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:13.720]  And they did believe that the end of a cycle, the end of an age, and
[1:23:13.720 --> 1:23:17.720]  again, I'm not putting stock because, you know, one way or the other, I'm just reporting
[1:23:17.720 --> 1:23:21.720]  here on what they believed. And they believe that
[1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:25.720]  it wasn't the end of the world. It has been interpreted as that by those that want to sell books and things.
[1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:29.720]  What it really says, and you know, I've actually been to the museums,
[1:23:29.720 --> 1:23:33.720]  read the text, looked at it, been on a lot of tours down in the
[1:23:33.720 --> 1:23:37.720]  central and of course, Southern North America, Southern Mexico
[1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:41.720]  on both sides of the peninsula there.
[1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:45.720]  And so they believe that it is the end of an age
[1:23:45.720 --> 1:23:49.720]  and so kind of a reset at that point. And then others come in and say there's a
[1:23:49.720 --> 1:23:53.720]  pole shift in this planet. And I remember, I mean, in 2000,
[1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:57.720]  2002, 2003, there's always authors trying to sell books that the planet
[1:23:57.720 --> 1:24:01.720]  actually is going to kill us and it's coming and freakouts. And then people try to
[1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:05.720]  put that with what I cover and what I talk about because there's other shows that
[1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:09.720]  are kind of a different genre but are similar to me. They cover the politics
[1:24:09.720 --> 1:24:13.720]  and the weird stuff going on in politics. Then they mix it in with
[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:17.720]  Chubacabra, Space Aliens, Planet X. And I'm not saying that's bad.
[1:24:17.720 --> 1:24:21.720]  That's all weird. It's interesting. It's creepy when you're driving down the road in the middle of the night to be listening to that.
[1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:25.720]  We're talking about shadow creatures. You're looking over your shoulder as you drive down
[1:24:25.720 --> 1:24:29.720]  the road. The point is, that's not what I do on this show. When I come on the air and I
[1:24:29.720 --> 1:24:33.720]  say, hey, the government's listening to your phone calls with AI computers with keywords,
[1:24:33.720 --> 1:24:37.720]  here's the documents. Or the government says they're building FEMA camps.
[1:24:37.720 --> 1:24:41.720]  Here's the San Francisco Chronicle, Houston Chronicle. Or Halliburton and Dinecore
[1:24:41.720 --> 1:24:45.720]  around child kidnapping rings, Chicago Tribune. You know, I bring you
[1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:49.720]  all the crazy weird news that's admitted but that never gets national attention
[1:24:49.720 --> 1:24:53.720]  but it gets regional attention and I cover that. A lot of people
[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:57.720]  think it's the end of the world in 2012. I don't think it is.
[1:24:57.720 --> 1:25:01.720]  The end of the world, if it does come, will come next week with some bio
[1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:05.720]  weapon, the government releases on accident, or some huge
[1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:09.720]  meteor hitting like happened with the dinosaurs. I appreciate your call.
[1:25:09.720 --> 1:25:13.720]  Am I not putting stock of what the Aztecs say?
[1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:17.720]  As interesting as they were, as interesting as their art was, they would sacrifice
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:21.720]  thousands of people every month, tens of thousands every year on certain holidays.
[1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:25.720]  They would drown their children. They would take hallucinogenic drugs
[1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:29.720]  and then pull huge strings with jagged glass through their
[1:25:29.720 --> 1:25:33.720]  tongues like Hellraiser for pain while they were hallucinating.
[1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:37.720]  Imagine hallucinating and pulling strings through your genitals and through your tongue,
[1:25:37.720 --> 1:25:41.720]  blood spewing, slicing themselves, cutting their children,
[1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:45.720]  gobbling their children's intestines. People then
[1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:49.720]  say, well, that's their culture. Don't bash them. Well, the Nazis had a culture
[1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:53.720]  of black uniforms and death and that's a bad culture. There are cultures
[1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:57.720]  that are degenerate and the Aztec culture was degenerate and the Mayan
[1:25:57.720 --> 1:26:01.720]  culture it grew out of was absolutely evil. Killing your children,
[1:26:01.720 --> 1:26:05.720]  sacrificing people, I mean, that's bad. The Soviet
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:09.720]  culture of killing 50 plus million people, the Chinese Communist
[1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:13.720]  culture of killing 60 million, invading Tibet, mass murdering millions
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:17.720]  is wrong. So I can make a judgment about a culture being
[1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:21.720]  degenerate and the Aztec culture was degenerate and very
[1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:25.720]  satanic. I mean, you ought to go down there and actually look at those temples, man. Just thousands
[1:26:25.720 --> 1:26:29.720]  of skulls carved on the walls and just hell raiser, man. It was like hell world
[1:26:29.720 --> 1:26:33.720]  or something with just these power tripping priests whacked out of their mind on
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:37.720]  drugs. And by the way, the main meat for
[1:26:37.720 --> 1:26:41.720]  the public, the reason the general public liked the sacrifices is they had a couple
[1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:45.720]  sacrifices every day in the smaller temple centers around villages.
[1:26:45.720 --> 1:26:49.720]  They would have villages all around and then a central city where they got their orders
[1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:53.720]  and they would kick the dead bodies of the people they sacrificed every day that
[1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:57.720]  was cut up and sundown and the people would get select meat cutlets. In fact,
[1:26:57.720 --> 1:27:01.720]  you got the local sub priest class would hang them up by their feet and cut up the select
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:05.720]  giblets and sell the meat out at reduced prices.
[1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:09.720]  And so you may think that's good. I don't think that's good.
[1:27:09.720 --> 1:27:13.720]  And so the main meat and the treasured meat was that of the
[1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:17.720]  children. And I've interviewed top anthropologist
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:21.720]  on the subject and it doesn't matter. I'm probably
[1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:25.720]  with El Cada because I'm against that now. Just worship Ishtar, I think everything's fine.
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:29.720]  Why though about religions or background? Just be ignorant. Just march
[1:27:29.720 --> 1:27:33.720]  madness. Everything's fine. Just trust your government. Everything's gonna be fine, folks.
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:37.720]  Go ahead. You're on the year. Patrick and San Marcus. Hey, Alex. Happy Ishtar day.
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:41.720]  Thank you, sir. I just wanted to, I know you're a Christian
[1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:45.720]  and I applaud that, especially for the business you're in. And I would like to
[1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:49.720]  kind of, I guess, for you to describe or kind of maybe answer a question
[1:27:49.720 --> 1:27:53.720]  for me is how can, especially on a day like
[1:27:53.720 --> 1:27:57.720]  this that's been taken over, you know, and it's supposed to be Christian
[1:27:57.720 --> 1:28:01.720]  for these super churches and these just
[1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:05.720]  extreme religious zealots that are changing Christianity and changing the
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:09.720]  basis of what you and I both believe and supporting a
[1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:13.720]  one-world government and basically leading several Christians and
[1:28:13.720 --> 1:28:17.720]  you know, sheep, so to speak, down to basically
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:21.720]  the mother. That's a great question. You want me to answer that after the break?
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:25.720]  Yes, sir. I take as much time as you need and I'll listen on the radio. Thank you.
[1:28:25.720 --> 1:28:29.720]  I'll come back and give you my quick take on that and we'll talk to Rob, Ted, Paula,
[1:28:29.720 --> 1:28:33.720]  and others and then I'm gonna get into your child in a
[1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:49.720]  federal DNA database.

[1:30:51.720 --> 1:30:55.720]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide,
[1:30:55.720 --> 1:30:59.720]  but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope. The first time in modern history
[1:30:59.720 --> 1:31:03.720]  the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide
[1:31:03.720 --> 1:31:07.720]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:11.720]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[1:31:51.720 --> 1:31:55.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention. Ron Paul did not quit. He is still in the race.
[1:31:55.720 --> 1:31:59.720]  Most Americans do not understand how the election process works.
[1:31:59.720 --> 1:32:03.720]  The media is lying. John McCain does not have the Republican nomination.
[1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:07.720]  The popular vote is just a straw poll, believe it or not.
[1:32:07.720 --> 1:32:11.720]  The delegates have the power over the elections, not the voters. After the mainstream media
[1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:15.720]  wrote a hit piece on how Ron Paul quit, many supporters quit as well.
[1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:19.720]  Ron Paul has stated he will continue his run for presidency as long as he has your continued
[1:32:19.720 --> 1:32:23.720]  support. Ron Paul has a plan. The delegates have not yet been voted on
[1:32:23.720 --> 1:32:27.720]  and they are voted first in county, then state, all the way to the national
[1:32:27.720 --> 1:32:31.720]  convention. Go to our website at RonPaulFlags.com
[1:32:31.720 --> 1:32:35.720]  and click on why Ron Paul will win. That's RonPaulFlags.com to find out
[1:32:35.720 --> 1:32:39.720]  more on how delegates work. Stand your ground. Go for the win and fly a
[1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:43.720]  Ron Paul flag today or call 731-664-1526
[1:32:43.720 --> 1:32:47.720]  for more information. That's 731-664-1526.
[1:33:17.720 --> 1:33:21.720]  Look, I'm not somebody up on my
[1:33:21.720 --> 1:33:25.720]  high horse. I'm not somebody up there telling everybody how to live their lives
[1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:29.720]  or the thousand different Christian sects that all fight with each other
[1:33:29.720 --> 1:33:33.720]  like the Pharisees on the hill saying they're the best
[1:33:33.720 --> 1:33:37.720]  for praying in public. But I am a Christian, been raised a Christian. I believe
[1:33:37.720 --> 1:33:41.720]  in what Jesus taught, I believe in Jesus. And you go to these churches
[1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:45.720]  you don't find that. You find a bunch of war-mongering, new world order supporting
[1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:49.720]  groups on the right or a bunch of gun-grabbing
[1:33:49.720 --> 1:33:53.720]  socialists on the left. And then, you know, all
[1:33:53.720 --> 1:33:57.720]  it's just tailored to each little group.
[1:33:57.720 --> 1:34:01.720]  But it's real simple. Christianity was
[1:34:01.720 --> 1:34:05.720]  oppressed and dominated and attacked for several hundred years after Christ.
[1:34:05.720 --> 1:34:09.720]  Then a Roman emperor decided to adopt it, but the occultist
[1:34:09.720 --> 1:34:13.720]  wouldn't go away. And so they hid everything
[1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:17.720]  basically in plain view in all of the saints and all of the different
[1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:21.720]  holidays and when they celebrated Christ's birthday. You know, that's
[1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:25.720]  for the middle of the winter, the darkest time of the winter, you know, when it starts
[1:34:25.720 --> 1:34:29.720]  then getting lighter after that. All Saints' Eve
[1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:33.720]  is on the date of when they celebrate going in to the winter
[1:34:33.720 --> 1:34:37.720]  out of the fall. I mean, they have all of these dates. They're all on key occult
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:41.720]  dates all over Europe, all over the Mediterranean, right into Asia.
[1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:45.720]  And they hide them in plain
[1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:49.720]  view. The bunny rabbit is the fertility symbol. The egg is the fertility symbol
[1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:53.720]  for Ishtar, both of them. The Babylonian goddess
[1:34:53.720 --> 1:34:57.720]  of fertility was worshipped all over in her different names. Every culture
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:01.720]  has the fertility goddess. This is all pre-Christianity stuff. And
[1:35:01.720 --> 1:35:05.720]  you know, the big Baptist churches with the big steeples, that is the male
[1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:09.720]  palace. And that is the Washington Monument. They'll give you a tour and tell you
[1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:13.720]  that. It is a giant male member. The
[1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:17.720]  capitals are women's breast. The doorways into them.
[1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:21.720]  I'm not going to go any further. This is mainstream architecture, mainstream
[1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:25.720]  historical info. If you go get a tour
[1:35:25.720 --> 1:35:29.720]  of the Washington Monument or of the Texas Monument or the
[1:35:29.720 --> 1:35:33.720]  goddess on top of the Texas capitol
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:37.720]  they're very point blank about it. And that's
[1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:41.720]  because pre-dating Christianity and then really taking over
[1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:45.720]  Judaism under Solomon, the son of King David.
[1:35:45.720 --> 1:35:49.720]  You know the Star of David? Do you know what that is?
[1:35:49.720 --> 1:35:53.720]  That's the most powerful in occult black magic. That is the most powerful symbol
[1:35:53.720 --> 1:35:57.720]  if you read the Old Testament, Solomon couldn't put the genie
[1:35:57.720 --> 1:36:01.720]  or the demon back in the bottle. And so God gave him that symbol
[1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:05.720]  to have total control over devils. I'm not saying this is real or not.
[1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:09.720]  The point is I'm telling you the history. So the Star of David is a black magic symbol.
[1:36:09.720 --> 1:36:13.720]  None of this is not really the Star of David. It's the seal
[1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:17.720]  of Solomon. See nothing you've been told
[1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:21.720]  is what it really is. So they openly call Easter Ishtar
[1:36:21.720 --> 1:36:25.720]  Easter. You run around talking about
[1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:29.720]  Jesus. And if you actually look in the Roman Annals
[1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:33.720]  three months off from when he was actually crucified.
[1:36:33.720 --> 1:36:37.720]  What Easter is, is it comes three days after the New Year.
[1:36:37.720 --> 1:36:41.720]  When is the New Year? Well I observed it.
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:45.720]  And by observed it doesn't mean I spiritually observed it. I mean I physically watched it happen
[1:36:45.720 --> 1:36:49.720]  as I was standing up on top of a natural gas platform
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:53.720]  out in the country. And I watched the moon come up at the exact same
[1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:57.720]  time that the sun went down. I was looking
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:37:01.720]  in one direction, looking at the huge red moon. Why is it red? You're looking through all the dust on the edge
[1:37:01.720 --> 1:37:05.720]  of the, it's a lens effect. Looking through hundreds of miles of
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:09.720]  atmosphere instead of just 30 miles of atmosphere looking up. That's why the moon changes color. You ever wonder
[1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:13.720]  that? When you're looking edge on, when a sun comes up or the moon comes up, why is it red?
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:17.720]  You're looking through all the dust and it's also, why does it look larger? It's a lensing effect
[1:37:17.720 --> 1:37:21.720]  because you're looking cross on. So taking the lenses of
[1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:25.720]  a pair of glasses and turning them to the side and looking through the glasses
[1:37:25.720 --> 1:37:29.720]  is called blurry and stuff's larger. Lensing effect.
[1:37:29.720 --> 1:37:33.720]  I'm trying to pause and they're looking at me like it understands
[1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:37.720]  because the earth is round, yes. Well you're al-Qaeda now if you say that. It's actually flat.
[1:37:37.720 --> 1:37:41.720]  But I'm already digressing. Answer the fellow's question.
[1:37:41.720 --> 1:37:45.720]  Just be aware of it. I'm not saying you're going to hell if you put out some
[1:37:45.720 --> 1:37:49.720]  Easter eggs. Just the point is, realize it is a pagan ritual.
[1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:53.720]  And the occultist, you know, they openly laugh
[1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:57.720]  about it and say, look at all these idiots out here. They're practitioners of this.
[1:37:57.720 --> 1:38:01.720]  You ever seen the movie Dragnet with Tom
[1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:05.720]  Hanks and Dan Aykroyd? It's really funny.
[1:38:05.720 --> 1:38:09.720]  And notice it's the local preachers, actually the devil worshiper. Well that's how it
[1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:13.720]  actually works. The cops, the drug dealer,
[1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:17.720]  the big mega church pastor, he's
[1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:21.720]  the high priest locally, generally.
[1:38:21.720 --> 1:38:25.720]  You have hundreds of cults. They usually run all of them. And that's just how it works.
[1:38:25.720 --> 1:38:29.720]  And then you go into the church and they've got the big steeple
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:33.720]  and you're all in there and it's a...
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:37.720]  That means that this is a patriarchal religion.
[1:38:37.720 --> 1:38:41.720]  The religion has a dome. It's goddess worship. Dome is the breast.
[1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:45.720]  And it's always crowned. Let me tell you another little esoteric secret.
[1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:49.720]  Wherever you find a war memorial at a capital or anywhere else, look around you.
[1:38:49.720 --> 1:38:53.720]  Let's say you're walking along next time and you see, for the 5,000 dead in the
[1:38:53.720 --> 1:38:57.720]  cavalry battalion of whatever, from Civil War,
[1:38:57.720 --> 1:39:01.720]  stop and go, wait, there'll be a goddess looking. And look around you.
[1:39:01.720 --> 1:39:05.720]  You will see within 100 yards up on top of a big pillar, there will be a goddess.
[1:39:05.720 --> 1:39:09.720]  And she'll have her hand outstretched towards the sacrifice.
[1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:13.720]  This is all over the world. Or vice versa. You're driving along
[1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:17.720]  and you see a goddess on top of a pillar, or you see it on top of a capital
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:21.720]  or you see it at a university. Go and stand in front of her and then
[1:39:21.720 --> 1:39:25.720]  look. And within about 100 degrees in front of her.
[1:39:25.720 --> 1:39:29.720]  In a wedge shape, fanning out in front of her,
[1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:33.720]  generally straight in front of her, there will be a sacrifice. They will put a
[1:39:33.720 --> 1:39:37.720]  dead war memorial in front of her. She needs blood.
[1:39:37.720 --> 1:39:41.720]  And so the practitioners of this religion, they had to be
[1:39:41.720 --> 1:39:45.720]  secretive about their Mithra cults and their Ishtar cults and
[1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:49.720]  the rest of it. So are there eulogia cults?
[1:39:49.720 --> 1:39:53.720]  Remember, even ABC News admits that the bushes worship
[1:39:53.720 --> 1:39:57.720]  eulogia, the Greek goddess, at Skull and Bones.
[1:39:57.720 --> 1:40:01.720]  You see. And if you study Hitler, he worshiped a goddess.
[1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:05.720]  And this is just what they do.
[1:40:05.720 --> 1:40:09.720]  So I hope I've answered your question now. Let's take a few calls and come back
[1:40:09.720 --> 1:40:13.720]  out of the esoteric into what I mainly focus on.
[1:40:13.720 --> 1:40:17.720]  And people call me and they go, you say it's Molek in your videos when you snuck into
[1:40:17.720 --> 1:40:21.720]  Bohemian Grove and showed the Skull and Bones boys when they're older, you know, running around
[1:40:21.720 --> 1:40:25.720]  doing their rituals. Yeah, I snuck into one of these meetings. I got footage of it.
[1:40:25.720 --> 1:40:29.720]  Doesn't just happen in movies. It happens in the real world. It's called The Order of Death.
[1:40:29.720 --> 1:40:33.720]  My film. I snuck in with Mike Hansen.
[1:40:33.720 --> 1:40:37.720]  But people call me and they go, Alex, that's not
[1:40:37.720 --> 1:40:41.720]  Molek. Molek was a big bull. They threw children into pits before.
[1:40:41.720 --> 1:40:45.720]  I know that the Canaanites,
[1:40:45.720 --> 1:40:49.720]  I understand that we're going off what they call the owl.
[1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:53.720]  They call it Molek in their literature. The Bohemian Grove, mainly
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:57.720]  Republican Christian hierarchy leadership. Imagine the sick joke to all these top
[1:40:57.720 --> 1:41:01.720]  preachers and top Republicans. They go to a homoerotic ancient
[1:41:01.720 --> 1:41:05.720]  bad to them. It's not the devil. They believe it's God. And they do all this for 15
[1:41:05.720 --> 1:41:09.720]  days in July. And the people sit there and believe they're good Christian
[1:41:09.720 --> 1:41:13.720]  conservatives. It's kind of sick, isn't it? But
[1:41:13.720 --> 1:41:17.720]  that's the whole thing about a cult. I mean, take India. They have tens of thousands
[1:41:17.720 --> 1:41:21.720]  of gods. Don't expect me to ever say any of this is serious
[1:41:21.720 --> 1:41:25.720]  or makes any sense. I'm just reporting on it. But people keep calling me and emailing me.
[1:41:25.720 --> 1:41:29.720]  You keep saying in your films, that's Molek. I know. And they go, Alex, we would
[1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:33.720]  show a picture of a bull with them throwing a baby into it out of old Roman
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:37.720]  text. That's not an owl. I know that.
[1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:41.720]  Don't say these occultists make any sense.
[1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:45.720]  Okay, I'm done. That doesn't even matter. Let's go ahead and talk to Kyle
[1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:49.720]  in Bastrob, Texas. You're on the air, Kyle.
[1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:53.720]  Welcome. Hello, Kyle.
[1:41:53.720 --> 1:41:57.720]  I don't even hear a phone feed there. Okay. Let's go ahead.
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:01.720]  Sorry, Kyle. And talk to Ted in Texas. Ted, you're on the air.
[1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:05.720]  Okay, let's go to Rob. Rob in New York. You there?
[1:42:05.720 --> 1:42:09.720]  Yeah, yeah, I'm here. Go ahead, sir.
[1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:13.720]  First time calling to your personal hero of mine, Alex. But I want to get your opinion on a couple
[1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:17.720]  of things, particularly this Reverend Wright situation with
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:21.720]  Obama. He basically says a lot of the same things you do, particularly with
[1:42:21.720 --> 1:42:25.720]  the drug trade and the drugs filtering into the country.
[1:42:25.720 --> 1:42:29.720]  And the media kind of really slams you. Stay there. I wasn't watching the clock. Stay there.
[1:42:29.720 --> 1:42:33.720]  I'm going to come back to you. And we're going to talk to Ted. And that's going to be it. Rob
[1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:37.720]  and Ted on the other side that I'm done. I can't take any more calls because I got to get into this
[1:42:37.720 --> 1:42:41.720]  illegal DNA database story. Final segment, two hours went by so fast.
[1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:45.720]  Some shows it's all new. Some shows it's all calls. And some shows I just
[1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:49.720]  flip out on air. That's one of them. We'll be right back.
[1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:53.720]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror. Loose change, final cut.
[1:42:53.720 --> 1:42:57.720]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement. The true story of the Bilderberg group.
[1:42:57.720 --> 1:43:01.720]  The late great USA. America, freedom to fascism.
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:05.720]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available

[1:43:49.720 --> 1:43:53.720]  Hi neighbor, they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[1:43:53.720 --> 1:43:57.720]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left
[1:43:57.720 --> 1:44:01.720]  at any price. We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations
[1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:05.720]  could care for those unable to care for themselves. We would intend
[1:44:05.720 --> 1:44:09.720]  not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend
[1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:13.720]  the facts of food disappearance are untrue. If the experience of the Katrina disaster
[1:44:13.720 --> 1:44:17.720]  is evidence, the bread line may have no bread.
[1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:21.720]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place,
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:25.720]  the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[1:44:25.720 --> 1:44:29.720]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless
[1:44:29.720 --> 1:44:33.720]  for the future. Call 800-409-5633
[1:44:33.720 --> 1:44:37.720]  800-409-5633

[1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:45.720]  Who am I? Nobody. Steve Shane, some of who cares.
[1:44:49.720 --> 1:44:53.720]  All you men out there you need to listen up. By the age of
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:57.720]  1 in 2 men already have a prostate-related health issue.
[1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:01.720]  What does this mean? It might be an enlarged prostate, difficulty going
[1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:05.720]  to the bathroom, and a diminished sex drive. Not a pretty picture.
[1:45:05.720 --> 1:45:09.720]  If you're a man, you need to give your body nutrition to support prostate health.
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:13.720]  There's no question about it. Many people hear this and they might think
[1:45:13.720 --> 1:45:17.720]  Saupolmetto, but there's something so much better out there. It's called beta
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:21.720]  prostate and it contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols
[1:45:21.720 --> 1:45:25.720]  than ordinary Saupolmetto. So before you try anything else, try
[1:45:25.720 --> 1:45:29.720]  beta prostate. Ignoring your prostate is not going to make the problems go away.
[1:45:29.720 --> 1:45:33.720]  Taking beta prostate is guaranteed to provide effective
[1:45:33.720 --> 1:45:37.720]  all-natural support. Dial 1-800-457-9914
[1:45:37.720 --> 1:45:41.720]  That's 1-800-457-9914. Call now
[1:45:41.720 --> 1:45:45.720]  and find out how you can get a free bottle of beta prostate with your order.

[1:45:49.720 --> 1:45:53.720]  It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913,
[1:45:53.720 --> 1:45:57.720]  all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan
[1:45:57.720 --> 1:46:01.720]  they issue. With never ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates,
[1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:05.720]  it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all
[1:46:05.720 --> 1:46:09.720]  of us slaves to our creditors. The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful
[1:46:09.720 --> 1:46:13.720]  attorney backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal
[1:46:13.720 --> 1:46:17.720]  loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[1:46:17.720 --> 1:46:21.720]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly
[1:46:21.720 --> 1:46:25.720]  payment, ending with nothing on your credit report. Join the thousands of Americans who
[1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:29.720]  now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[1:46:29.720 --> 1:46:33.720]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[1:46:33.720 --> 1:46:37.720]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600
[1:46:37.720 --> 1:46:41.720]  That's 877-943-8600 or visit
[1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:45.720]  FDRS.org. Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[1:46:45.720 --> 1:46:49.720]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:57.720]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[1:47:01.720 --> 1:47:05.720]  Alright, final segment here on
[1:47:05.720 --> 1:47:09.720]  Ishtar Day. Worship of the Goddess Ishtar.
[1:47:09.720 --> 1:47:13.720]  I'm going to take a few more of your phone calls
[1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:17.720]  and I want to hit on this final story. Actually, I have a couple here.
[1:47:17.720 --> 1:47:21.720]  I should have gotten this earlier, but Sailor V.
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:25.720]  Going back to Rob.
[1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:29.720]  Finish up the question of the point you were making.
[1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:33.720]  Yeah, Rob, go ahead.
[1:47:33.720 --> 1:47:37.720]  I saw how Bill Berg was trying to outline the plans for getting somebody like Hillary
[1:47:37.720 --> 1:47:41.720]  or McCain. I read 1984 and I saw how Winston was
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:45.720]  in the outer party and Obama was really striking me as this outer party guy.
[1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:49.720]  I kind of wanted to get your feedback and maybe if you could have, you know, right come on your show
[1:47:49.720 --> 1:47:53.720]  or something. I mean, I'm kind of curious about how you think this is going to play out.
[1:47:53.720 --> 1:47:57.720]  Well, obviously, we've been trying to get Barack Obama's preacher on who just retired
[1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:01.720]  and it's a very important question. Look, I tried to analyze this to take five hours
[1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:05.720]  but let me just give you the basics. Barack Obama is a dangerous politician
[1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:09.720]  just like Hillary, just like McCain. Bill Richardson is top Bohemian Grove,
[1:48:09.720 --> 1:48:13.720]  top trilateral commission, CFR, Bilderberg group.
[1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:17.720]  Bill Richardson is as bad as it gets and he's going to probably be his running mate.
[1:48:17.720 --> 1:48:21.720]  They're all bad. The globalists went either way. This is a simulated election.
[1:48:21.720 --> 1:48:25.720]  They have to make you, I mean, the voting fraud alone proven that it's all a scam.
[1:48:25.720 --> 1:48:29.720]  Now the public knows that. 85% major polls.
[1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:33.720]  Barack Obama had to be involved in those inner city politics to get elected
[1:48:33.720 --> 1:48:37.720]  to the state house and then to become a state senator than a federal senator.
[1:48:37.720 --> 1:48:41.720]  And so he did attend that local church, which is the prominent black church
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:45.720]  and I do agree with about 90% of what that preacher is saying about
[1:48:45.720 --> 1:48:49.720]  the government shipping and the drugs and about how blacks have been
[1:48:49.720 --> 1:48:53.720]  enslaved. I mean, that's not a secret. His wife though
[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:57.720]  saying that America has nothing good about it or nothing to be proud of. We're not perfect
[1:48:57.720 --> 1:49:01.720]  but it is taken out of context. It is hyped up but
[1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:05.720]  forget what his preacher says. Barack Obama is a New World Order type.
[1:49:05.720 --> 1:49:09.720]  Do you hear Barack Obama saying CPS shouldn't take black kids
[1:49:09.720 --> 1:49:13.720]  to test drugs and pesticides on them because they do? Do you
[1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:17.720]  hear him talking about all the things they do to blacks? No.
[1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:21.720]  By the way, Bill Richardson is less than half Hispanic. Why is he called Hispanic?
[1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:25.720]  Barack Obama is more than half white.
[1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:29.720]  Why is he called black? I mean, I don't care if they're black or purple or green. Point is
[1:49:29.720 --> 1:49:33.720]  what is that too? Why is that always the case?
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:37.720]  Barack Obama is a politician and they're using this
[1:49:37.720 --> 1:49:41.720]  against him. Hillary got scared when the Geraldine Ferrara race comment
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:45.720]  about people only like him because he's black. No, people like him because he's charming
[1:49:45.720 --> 1:49:49.720]  and because he doesn't have all the baggage and the murders
[1:49:49.720 --> 1:49:53.720]  and the death list and the corruption and the socialized healthcare
[1:49:53.720 --> 1:49:57.720]  and the linen pins on the first day in the White House like Hillary was wearing
[1:49:57.720 --> 1:50:01.720]  according to Ultimate Access by the FBI agent who was working in there
[1:50:01.720 --> 1:50:05.720]  with Gary Aldrich. We need to get him back on.
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:09.720]  Unlimited Access. That was an unlimited access. They all came to work wearing linen and
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:13.720]  styling pins. These people are nuts. They're completely insane. They're all bad.
[1:50:13.720 --> 1:50:17.720]  Frankly, I hope Hillary gets in because she's so evil
[1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:21.720]  she'll get less traction. Barack Obama will get a lot done for the New World Order.
[1:50:21.720 --> 1:50:25.720]  He wants to CPS your kids if you don't have healthcare. Yeah, they take your kids in Boston
[1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:29.720]  in Massachusetts if you don't have healthcare when you can't even pay for it. We don't need
[1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:33.720]  more government. We need less.
[1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:37.720]  But yeah, the stuff his preachers are saying, that's nothing. They just hype it up into
[1:50:37.720 --> 1:50:41.720]  a political football. Well, the American people don't care if a prison camp's been built
[1:50:41.720 --> 1:50:45.720]  and the government's poisoned in the water and it doesn't even matter.
[1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:49.720]  I'll get to Ted in a minute from Texas if we have time. I'm sorry to all the others, but let me just get to this now.
[1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:53.720]  Okay, I just saw this the other day
[1:50:53.720 --> 1:50:57.720]  in Op-Ed News, a great online news site, and I was already aware of this. I'm bragging
[1:50:57.720 --> 1:51:01.720]  that, oh, I know everything. I'm saying I know even more than what's in this. It's much
[1:51:01.720 --> 1:51:05.720]  worse than this article says. Just Google states handover DNA of Newborn's
[1:51:05.720 --> 1:51:09.720]  Department of Homeland Security. What I didn't know I learned here is I knew
[1:51:09.720 --> 1:51:13.720]  for 35 years at birth, they say, oh, we're going to take some blood from your baby now
[1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:17.720]  and it's going to go get blood tested at the health department.
[1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:21.720]  Now ask yourself this, why can't the health department, why can't the hospital
[1:51:21.720 --> 1:51:25.720]  test the blood? They're a hospital. Well, they say it's a mandate, not a law.
[1:51:25.720 --> 1:51:29.720]  A mandate, we just give us the blood.
[1:51:29.720 --> 1:51:33.720]  And I learned more than a decade ago, and I've had state reps, federal congressmen on,
[1:51:33.720 --> 1:51:37.720]  I've had members of parliament on from Australia
[1:51:37.720 --> 1:51:41.720]  that for 35 years in five nations, it's all part of the international effort,
[1:51:41.720 --> 1:51:45.720]  they take all your blood at birth, and they put it in a database. Four crime databases
[1:51:45.720 --> 1:51:49.720]  for DNA studies, they sell it to drug companies, the state says they now
[1:51:49.720 --> 1:51:53.720]  own your body's DNA, and that's all in the article. I have hearings
[1:51:53.720 --> 1:51:57.720]  on it from the state of Minnesota. Go read it
[1:51:57.720 --> 1:52:01.720]  for yourself. But the good part about this story out of
[1:52:01.720 --> 1:52:05.720]  Op-Ed News by Marty Oakley, states hand over DNA of newborns
[1:52:05.720 --> 1:52:09.720]  of DHS is that it has links to all the federal bodies
[1:52:09.720 --> 1:52:13.720]  that hold it here domestically. And in the U.S. who
[1:52:13.720 --> 1:52:17.720]  is over this in all 50 states is the University of Texas. And you
[1:52:17.720 --> 1:52:21.720]  can go to UT's own sub-website, and
[1:52:21.720 --> 1:52:25.720]  UT's always basically been a government front the last 60 years. It's genes-r-ush
[1:52:25.720 --> 1:52:29.720]  dot U-T-H-S-C
[1:52:29.720 --> 1:52:33.720]  S-A, or just type in N-N-S-G-R-C
[1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:37.720]  National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center, and they admit it all.
[1:52:37.720 --> 1:52:41.720]  They say they own your baby's blood, they do it all. When you come in, when you're being admitted
[1:52:41.720 --> 1:52:45.720]  they have you sign hundreds of forms. One of them is very vague and just says you
[1:52:45.720 --> 1:52:49.720]  agree to genetic screening as it's important to track genetic diseases, and that you agree
[1:52:49.720 --> 1:52:53.720]  that the health department owns this blood. And it's all admitted here. When you sign that
[1:52:53.720 --> 1:52:57.720]  it goes in now. Now, up until five years ago they said they were
[1:52:57.720 --> 1:53:01.720]  using it in some crime databases. Now it's
[1:53:01.720 --> 1:53:05.720]  all, and it started in Australia when I first learned of it a few years ago, where
[1:53:05.720 --> 1:53:09.720]  they said, hey we have all the blood of the babies, let's put it in the national crime database. So it started there
[1:53:09.720 --> 1:53:13.720]  then in England, now the U.S. has announced it, and that's the sick thing about
[1:53:13.720 --> 1:53:17.720]  this is that your baby, again, your thumb scan to get a driver's license
[1:53:17.720 --> 1:53:21.720]  biometrically. What criminals used to have to do. Guilty until proven innocent.
[1:53:21.720 --> 1:53:25.720]  They look at your bank accounts every day with their computers without
[1:53:25.720 --> 1:53:29.720]  warrants. The federal government admits it. They listen to your cell phone, track
[1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:33.720]  your cell phone without warrants, but now they have to sell it to you so they say, oh
[1:53:33.720 --> 1:53:37.720]  we just don't have a fourth amendment for al-Qaeda calling America.
[1:53:37.720 --> 1:53:41.720]  And the public who can't find the U.S. on a globe or doesn't know any basic facts about the
[1:53:41.720 --> 1:53:45.720]  world works buys it. So just understand that you have to
[1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:49.720]  say no to that form and you have to tell them no.
[1:53:49.720 --> 1:53:53.720]  They'll try to threaten you and say it's the law, it's not the law, unless you want your child in the
[1:53:53.720 --> 1:53:57.720]  Homeland Security DNA criminal database where they can then frame your child with that blood.
[1:53:57.720 --> 1:54:01.720]  They can then give false positives with that blood. Also they admit here in state
[1:54:01.720 --> 1:54:05.720]  hearings in Minnesota and Texas that just some of the states that have
[1:54:05.720 --> 1:54:09.720]  looked at it, oh this is being discussed, they just don't tell you the slaves about it,
[1:54:09.720 --> 1:54:13.720]  that one-third of the children are given a false positive for blood disease and then that goes
[1:54:13.720 --> 1:54:17.720]  in your database with the insurance companies for life.
[1:54:17.720 --> 1:54:21.720]  So it's also very discriminatory, but so what?
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:25.720]  You want to be a slave? Let them suck your baby's blood at birth. Let them use their
[1:54:25.720 --> 1:54:29.720]  Comcast cable boxes to watch you and listen to you.
[1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:33.720]  This is how they operate.
[1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:37.720]  And al-Qaeda is made up.
[1:54:37.720 --> 1:54:41.720]  Folks, let me just explain something to you in closing. I'm going to cover this.
[1:54:41.720 --> 1:54:45.720]  Here's a story by Paul Watson and by Steve Watson. McCain says it's common
[1:54:45.720 --> 1:54:49.720]  knowledge that Iran is training al-Qaeda. Quote from the Washington Post.
[1:54:49.720 --> 1:54:53.720]  Press to elaborate, McCain said it was common knowledge and has been reported in the media
[1:54:53.720 --> 1:54:57.720]  that al-Qaeda is going back into Iran and receiving training and we are coming back into Iraq
[1:54:57.720 --> 1:55:01.720]  from Iran. That's
[1:55:01.720 --> 1:55:05.720]  well-known and it's unfortunate. A few moments later, this is in Iraq, Senator
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:09.720]  Joseph Lieberman standing just behind McCain, stepped forward and whispered and the president
[1:55:09.720 --> 1:55:13.720]  said, I'm sorry, the Iranians are training extremists on al-Qaeda.
[1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:17.720]  Here's the story. McCain flubs, Shiites and Sunnis
[1:55:17.720 --> 1:55:21.720]  vice versa. Here is the Reuters story. McCain shrugs off
[1:55:21.720 --> 1:55:25.720]  Obama attack over Iraq gaff. Presidential candidate John McCain shrugged off
[1:55:25.720 --> 1:55:29.720]  criticism and it goes on to say that he said that Shiites are Sunnis.
[1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:33.720]  Why is this important?
[1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:37.720]  The news. Mainstream neocon radio. It's not conservative. It's anti-American
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:41.720]  commitment to neutralize conservatives. I hear them every day say Iran is training al-Qaeda.
[1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:45.720]  Iran is al-Qaeda. Iran almost invaded
[1:55:45.720 --> 1:55:49.720]  during the 1980s again in the 90s because of
[1:55:49.720 --> 1:55:53.720]  al-Qaeda, CIA funded, killing Iranian diplomats.
[1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:57.720]  Iran is Shiite, the opposite group
[1:55:57.720 --> 1:56:01.720]  from the Sunnis and the
[1:56:01.720 --> 1:56:05.720]  derivation of that, the Wahhabist. Al-Qaeda
[1:56:05.720 --> 1:56:09.720]  was funded and created by the CIA in 79 out of Wahhabist
[1:56:09.720 --> 1:56:13.720]  sects. They used previous Wahhabist sects to overthrow secular governments
[1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:17.720]  in Iran and all over the region and our government puts the radical Muslims
[1:56:17.720 --> 1:56:21.720]  in. Do you understand history? No, you don't.
[1:56:21.720 --> 1:56:25.720]  Now, we learned four years ago that the number three in al-Qaeda was given
[1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:29.720]  hundreds of millions of dollars. It was announced publicly last year and admitted.
[1:56:29.720 --> 1:56:33.720]  To attack Iran, kill police, bomb facilities, blow up dams, machine
[1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:37.720]  gun children, trying to get the Iranians to take it. The Iranians lay there and
[1:56:37.720 --> 1:56:41.720]  take it, knowing if they fight back against al-Qaeda, they will say that it's a war
[1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:45.720]  and that a war has started. Just like our government used al-Qaeda to attack the Serbs,
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:49.720]  when the Serbs fought back, they handed Kosovo over to the Serbs. You didn't know the history,
[1:56:49.720 --> 1:56:53.720]  go research it. That's a Senate report on that. I want to explain this again to
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:56:57.720]  you very, very slowly. Our criminal government created
[1:56:57.720 --> 1:57:01.720]  al-Qaeda. They used them to attack the Serbs. Now they're using them to attack the Iranians.
[1:57:01.720 --> 1:57:05.720]  But that isn't enough for our criminal media and government, corporate controlled media.
[1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:09.720]  They then come out and say that Iran is funding al-Qaeda
[1:57:09.720 --> 1:57:13.720]  and that Iran was behind 9-11 and that Iran is attacking Iraq
[1:57:13.720 --> 1:57:17.720]  with al-Qaeda. It's the opposite group. They're at war
[1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:21.720]  with the CIA and al-Qaeda. Now, not saying they're
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:25.720]  good, all governments are evil. The history shows you that. The point is al-Qaeda
[1:57:25.720 --> 1:57:29.720]  is run by our criminal government. That's a historical fact.
[1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:33.720]  The hijackers were all U.S. government agents. It's all documented in my films,
[1:57:33.720 --> 1:57:37.720]  PrisonPlanet.com. God bless you. See you live next Sunday and back tomorrow live.
[1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:41.720]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. As you know, GCN
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:45.720]  is a huge supporter of Ron Paul and all he stands for. That's why for a limited time
[1:57:45.720 --> 1:57:49.720]  I have personally set aside commercial inventory-long advertisers the chance to show
[1:57:49.720 --> 1:57:53.720]  their personal support for Ron Paul while promoting their products. If you would like to voice
[1:57:53.720 --> 1:57:57.720]  your support for Ron Paul's march to the White House and have thought about advertising
[1:57:57.720 --> 1:58:01.720]  for GCN, give us a call at 877-996-4327.
[1:58:01.720 --> 1:58:05.720]  That's 877-996-4327 or go to GCNLive.com
[1:58:05.720 --> 1:58:29.720]  today and click on the support Ron Paul link on our homepage.
[1:58:39.720 --> 1:58:43.720]  Since the year 2000, earthquakes, heat waves, droughts, tsunamis, floods,
[1:58:43.720 --> 1:58:47.720]  fires and hurricanes have killed over one million people worldwide and forced tens
[1:58:47.720 --> 1:58:51.720]  of millions to go without food and water. After Katrina, the media was eager to show
[1:58:51.720 --> 1:58:55.720]  victims in New Orleans begging for food. If a disaster strikes you and your loved ones
[1:58:55.720 --> 1:58:59.720]  and you have no stored food, you'll be begging as well. Now our economy
[1:58:59.720 --> 1:59:03.720]  is slipping into an abyss that even Donald Trump says will make the Great Depression
[1:59:03.720 --> 1:59:07.720]  look like a Sunday picnic. The US dollar is worth less today than it was
[1:59:07.720 --> 1:59:11.720]  even last week. Before food prices skyrocket, trucks stop running and stores close
[1:59:11.720 --> 1:59:15.720]  their doors. Survival Enterprises can help you prepare. They're master distributors
[1:59:15.720 --> 1:59:19.720]  of Mountain House freeze-dried food with up to a 50-year shelf life.
[1:59:19.720 --> 1:59:23.720]  Survival Enterprises has real butter, cheese and bread, real beef, chicken
[1:59:23.720 --> 1:59:27.720]  and turkey all canned for long-term storage. For their website and more info call
