[01:40.400 --> 01:45.560]  resisting their their Obamacare operation is civil war level you see
[01:45.560 --> 01:52.920]  they've always been branding Obama as Abe Lincoln and before even that elected
[01:52.920 --> 01:55.960]  saying if they try to block us because the globalists know that the
[01:55.960 --> 01:59.320]  constitutional remedy is state nullification he'll just become the
[01:59.320 --> 02:03.680]  new Lincoln and federalize everything as they are already federalizing the
[02:03.680 --> 02:08.720]  entire system so that's some of the news up on drudgereport.com continuing with
[02:08.720 --> 02:16.880]  our top stories from info wars dot com Seymour Hirsch bin Laden raid one big
[02:16.880 --> 02:21.280]  lie and that's buried in an interview with the London Guardian will you guys
[02:21.280 --> 02:27.240]  print me the actual London Guardian link thank you that's Cy Hirsch ladies and
[02:27.240 --> 02:33.520]  gentlemen who exposed Cheney's plan to attack US ships in the Strait of Hormuz
[02:33.520 --> 02:43.560]  to blame the Iranian government in 2007 but George W. Bush of all people blocked
[02:43.560 --> 02:47.160]  Cheney who was really operating as president one of the few times Bush
[02:47.160 --> 02:51.160]  actually stood up and operated as president because Bush likes the Navy
[02:51.160 --> 02:56.320]  Seals is what basically came out from the White House sources through Seymour
[02:56.320 --> 03:01.000]  Hirsch and he didn't like the idea of blowing up Navy Seals because they
[03:01.000 --> 03:08.320]  were going to order the Navy Seals to attack a US Navy ship of the Strait of
[03:08.320 --> 03:12.400]  Hormuz and the Navy Seals we don't have all the details that reportedly didn't
[03:12.400 --> 03:17.960]  like the idea and then of course Fox Fallon resigned over it all and that's
[03:17.960 --> 03:22.480]  one reason we didn't get an attack on Iran I mean thank God at least our Navy
[03:22.480 --> 03:27.280]  isn't evil enough to blow up our own ships and then obviously have the Navy
[03:27.280 --> 03:33.240]  then attack the fake PT boats painted up blue like the Iranian boats and I guess
[03:33.240 --> 03:36.440]  the Navy Seals were supposed to jump out and survive somehow but I mean I
[03:36.440 --> 03:41.280]  imagine getting orders from Dick Cheney to start making fake PT boats to launch
[03:41.280 --> 03:45.600]  a false flag I mean that shows they must have the Seals doing incredibly
[03:45.600 --> 03:50.240]  corrupt stuff that they would even try to give them an order like that I mean
[03:50.240 --> 03:53.920]  even if you hate the Iranian government you don't attack a US ship to blame it
[03:53.920 --> 03:57.920]  on them but that's the type of dirty tricks that go on and ladies and gentlemen
[03:57.920 --> 04:11.240]  Sy Hirsch he says that the bin Laden story is 100% fiction 100% fake and one
[04:11.240 --> 04:16.280]  big lie and pathetic yes it's the whole that's what I'm telling you the whole
[04:16.280 --> 04:22.320]  thing is a lie and I've talked to Navy SEAL families off air on air I have a
[04:22.320 --> 04:29.040]  Navy SEAL contact that one week after it happened was absolutely outraged he was
[04:29.040 --> 04:34.800]  in SEAL team three had a friend in SEAL team six who is still alive and they
[04:34.800 --> 04:40.200]  all knew that that helicopter with 23 Navy SEALs on it and Army forces as well
[04:40.200 --> 04:45.400]  was blown up and remember you heard that here first and then now it's all come
[04:45.400 --> 04:50.280]  out you heard that here first we don't make stuff up this is dangerous to have

[10:07.020 --> 10:13.420]  technotronic age really begin to run when it was just crawling a few years
[10:13.420 --> 10:19.220]  ago we are seeing the rise of the mega tyrants but also every action as an
[10:19.220 --> 10:24.180]  equal and opposite reaction we're seeing the rise of the human spirit to
[10:24.180 --> 10:29.300]  resist it we will see the best in people and the worst in people folks that we
[10:29.300 --> 10:35.380]  thought we're gonna be allies of liberty will join sauron folks that we
[10:35.380 --> 10:38.620]  thought we're gonna join evil will come to the side of good this is what
[10:38.620 --> 10:42.660]  happens throughout history during times of great crisis and you are living
[10:42.660 --> 10:49.660]  undoubtedly in the greatest time in human history it is a fabulous adventure
[10:49.660 --> 10:57.300]  fabulous beyond imagination marvel at all the intricate facets of reality and

[11:02.820 --> 11:06.780]  painful things that are happening as well the destruction and twisting of the
[11:06.780 --> 11:11.700]  human spirit on top of it you will see the heights of human liberty you will
[11:11.700 --> 11:16.580]  see the depths of human degradation and enslavement my friends thank you so much
[11:16.580 --> 11:22.700]  for joining us people worldwide right now are deciding which side they're on do
[11:22.700 --> 11:28.660]  you stand with libertarian pros human ideas or do you stand with the
[11:28.660 --> 11:33.140]  collective with the gang with the centralized systems that have always
[11:33.140 --> 11:39.100]  delivered in their final stages hell on earth yes collectivism can actually
[11:39.100 --> 11:45.620]  deliver empowerment and wealth in its first phases but even when it's done for
[11:45.620 --> 11:52.940]  the best of intentions like the ring of doom the ring of Mordor it always turns
[11:52.940 --> 11:59.260]  towards evil in the end to use that analogy there were rings given unto men
[11:59.260 --> 12:05.660]  rings of power but in secret a one ring was forged to rule them all and in the
[12:05.660 --> 12:09.620]  darkness bind them and that is the new world order that's what you have to
[12:09.620 --> 12:15.420]  understand using that analogy using that archetypal imagery that J. R. R. Tolkien
[12:15.420 --> 12:22.700]  the great sociologist anthropologist archaeologist linguist and folklore
[12:22.700 --> 12:28.460]  researcher was was putting forward in his Christian cosmology of Lord of the
[12:28.460 --> 12:33.140]  Rings is Christian cosmology that's his words not mine just to see as Lewis the
[12:33.140 --> 12:37.500]  lion the witch in the wardrobe and it's all basically the same archetypal story
[12:37.500 --> 12:43.020]  over and over again and we resonate with it because it's true and you've got all
[12:43.020 --> 12:47.980]  these excuses and all the free stuff and all the power that evil offers you
[12:47.980 --> 12:53.940]  up front but in the end it is enslavement in the Ice Queen's palace in
[12:53.940 --> 12:58.020]  the Ninth Circle of Hell for the Ninth Circle of Hell is not fiery but frozen
[12:58.020 --> 13:03.900]  and cold devoid of any passion but the dark lust of death now my friends again
[13:03.900 --> 13:10.500]  it is Friday the 27th day this is teleprompter free talking point free
[13:10.500 --> 13:14.580]  worldwide radio broadcasts and if I sound excited and sound like I'm in a good
[13:14.580 --> 13:20.620]  mood it's because in the midst of this huge battle we are seeing enemy
[13:20.620 --> 13:26.660]  formations enemy capital ships coming in if you if you image this as a as a
[13:26.660 --> 13:31.980]  science fiction attack with with with with armies meeting on the planes land
[13:31.980 --> 13:37.620]  sea and air and huge troops ships coming in out of orbit from the technocratic
[13:37.620 --> 13:44.660]  launch bases and mother ships are blowing up in huge fiery crescendos in
[13:44.660 --> 13:50.940]  the night sky and our forces are having victory after victory after victory
[13:50.940 --> 13:56.780]  after victory after victory after victory but I'll tell you why the human
[13:56.780 --> 14:01.580]  instinct is in a death struggle because once the enemy technocracy comes in and
[14:01.580 --> 14:06.100]  the next five ten fifteen twenty years depending on how long we can hold it back
[14:06.100 --> 14:13.340]  the supremacy of the enemy is going to be palpable right now we've been hit by
[14:13.340 --> 14:18.180]  their vanguard setup operations if we can defeat them back them off we can
[14:18.180 --> 14:24.180]  build a technological cultural spiritual fortress system that can defeat
[14:24.180 --> 14:27.500]  them do you understand the analogy I'm giving you here in a military parlance
[14:27.500 --> 14:32.740]  and popular culture we have to defeat this wave and then really get ready for
[14:32.740 --> 14:36.620]  the main mother ships that are coming in out of deep space right now you
[14:36.620 --> 14:40.780]  understand we haven't even been hit ladies and gentlemen by the next phase
[14:40.780 --> 14:44.620]  if they get their plan in that's why they're so arrogant and think they're
[14:44.620 --> 14:48.100]  still gonna win even though we're beating them because we're only we're
[14:48.100 --> 14:51.740]  only defeating right now what we think is their main army is only their
[14:51.740 --> 14:57.220]  special forces operations literally do you understand that that and that's
[14:57.220 --> 15:02.300]  mainly because their own operatives that are still human not AI computer that
[15:02.300 --> 15:06.940]  will follow any order understand instinctively the humanities under attack
[15:06.940 --> 15:11.180]  and want to join us so that's the reason we're defeating them is we have moles
[15:11.180 --> 15:16.460]  in all their operations we have people quietly sabotaging quietly leaking
[15:16.460 --> 15:20.620]  quietly just doing nothing and that's why we're blowing them to bits because
[15:20.620 --> 15:24.660]  they're not even firing on us you understand that the people they have
[15:24.660 --> 15:29.820]  firing on us our little egomaniac mindless idiots low-level mid-level and
[15:29.820 --> 15:35.740]  at the top but the main strata through the bottom in the mid-level is on our
[15:35.740 --> 15:39.060]  side but they have minions within the mid structure and the lower structure
[15:39.060 --> 15:43.620]  attacking us and the entire top structure psychopathic sworn to dominance
[15:43.620 --> 15:47.660]  sworn to technocratic power sworn to transhumanism and their delusion of
[15:47.660 --> 15:51.620]  everlasting life through their own creation of godhood they don't believe
[15:51.620 --> 15:55.980]  in God yet they will become God as Ray Kurzweil has said he wants to become God
[15:55.980 --> 16:00.420]  Google says they want to become God and be omnipresent and take our free will
[16:00.420 --> 16:06.140]  they are the enemy of the universe the enemy of all that's good the enemy of
[16:06.140 --> 16:11.820]  free will the enemy of life the enemy of art the enemy of creativity the enemy
[16:11.820 --> 16:17.700]  of security the enemy of every man woman and child on this planet and you
[16:17.700 --> 16:22.220]  listening to me today know that's true no matter who you are if you still have
[16:22.220 --> 16:25.980]  humanity in you and you're not a psychopath or you're not a sociopath and
[16:25.980 --> 16:31.220]  you haven't had your humanity destroyed then you know that you have heard
[16:31.220 --> 16:36.500]  Veritas the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth now why am I so
[16:36.500 --> 16:46.660]  excited today I woke up at 6 a.m. to see Paul Watson publish this article
[16:46.660 --> 16:52.220]  copy rush one more popping the paper always love that that's why I do it I mean
[16:52.220 --> 16:58.620]  absolutely what is the good news here ladies and gentlemen some got warning to
[16:58.620 --> 17:05.380]  avoid Westgate before bloody siege that's in that's in Kenya folks in Nairobi and
[17:05.380 --> 17:10.060]  it turns out we're gonna get into this after the break it turns out that
[17:10.060 --> 17:17.340]  indeed there was the warning and it turns out that it appears that it was
[17:17.340 --> 17:23.140]  staged by elements in the government as usual working with the White House who
[17:23.140 --> 17:26.620]  we know runs that very Islamist group and is funding them on record we have
[17:26.620 --> 17:32.060]  Dr. Corsi on the broadcast and that they did this as a political diversion
[17:32.060 --> 17:36.780]  bare minimum they let the jihadis in I'm gonna get into that and let me give you
[17:36.780 --> 17:40.460]  the rest of the story and again here's the great news everything's coming out
[17:40.460 --> 17:48.220]  now the ATF blew the whistle just as they did on fast and furious as evil as
[17:48.220 --> 17:52.420]  the agency is they're not all bad even though they've bought into a fraud and
[17:52.420 --> 17:55.780]  that's the job they have they blew the whistle on that they blew the whistle on
[17:55.780 --> 18:00.820]  not being allowed into investigate the highly suspicious shooting a few weeks
[18:00.820 --> 18:07.100]  ago as you know a week and a half ago two Mondays ago to be technical nine ten
[18:07.100 --> 18:11.020]  days ago obsess on fact towards the point is they were told they can't get
[18:11.020 --> 18:14.140]  in to look at even though it's their jurisdiction and the SWAT team that
[18:14.140 --> 18:18.020]  happened to be rolling by from training fully armed and loaded I've now talked
[18:18.020 --> 18:22.100]  to them I'll just leave it at that and you've seen them in the BBC but
[18:22.100 --> 18:25.940]  specifically it wasn't like the BBC said there was a four-man team that was all
[18:25.940 --> 18:29.340]  that was left at the Capitol because it wasn't in session there was a 20-man
[18:29.340 --> 18:34.180]  team driving back to the Capitol a mile that's why they were there in five

[24:10.500 --> 24:18.580]  into a burning ring of fire I went down down down and the flames went higher and
[24:18.580 --> 24:24.820]  it burns again I use the analogy of space aliens attacking our planet not in a
[24:24.820 --> 24:29.460]  literal way obviously before the media grabs that but I like in psychopaths and
[24:29.460 --> 24:34.460]  and control freaks that that try to dumb down the population that see us as
[24:34.460 --> 24:40.020]  animals as basically another species and if you research that the elite believe
[24:40.020 --> 24:44.260]  they're another species just type that in that's in all their literature for
[24:44.260 --> 24:52.180]  about 150 actually 160 years since the 1850s with Francis Galton and many
[24:52.180 --> 24:58.420]  others and that's where social Darwinism comes from that they're doing us a
[24:58.420 --> 25:02.860]  favor hurting us and killing us and poisoning us and dumbing us down and
[25:02.860 --> 25:06.860]  even though this sounds crazy history is crazy look at all the other stuff
[25:06.860 --> 25:11.220]  governments have done look at all the torture and boiling people in oil and
[25:11.220 --> 25:16.360]  crucifying 10,000 in a single day and lining the entire you know road from
[25:16.360 --> 25:20.500]  Rome all the way to the coastline and the Aztec sacrificing tens of thousands
[25:20.500 --> 25:25.940]  a day on certain holidays and the druids and Japanese samurai's would test
[25:25.940 --> 25:30.220]  out a new shore on a villager that didn't bow far enough I mean it the elites
[25:30.220 --> 25:34.980]  are always about exercising raw power and killing and humiliating the general
[25:34.980 --> 25:42.180]  public you've got the general average person that just wants to be told what
[25:42.180 --> 25:49.820]  to do and just wants to live their life as kind of like a cow or something okay
[25:49.820 --> 25:54.540]  and then you've got people that see them as cattle and and hate them and have to
[25:54.540 --> 25:57.980]  stain over them and dominate them and people that want to be cattle grovel
[25:57.980 --> 26:02.300]  when they're treated like that but then you've got those of us that want to see
[26:02.300 --> 26:08.180]  humanity built up and want to expand the understanding and and awakening of
[26:08.180 --> 26:15.500]  humanity and who are on humanity's team we are the people that change history
[26:15.500 --> 26:20.340]  every time and and and fight back against the tyrants and many times are
[26:20.340 --> 26:24.740]  defeated but many times succeed and we're at that historic crossroads right
[26:24.740 --> 26:32.660]  now times a thousand this is it and all the news coming out where across the
[26:32.660 --> 26:37.540]  board now when there's an underwear bomber we have whistleblowers on a week
[26:37.540 --> 26:43.500]  after Kurt Haskell his wife as well both lawyers who saw the government get
[26:43.500 --> 26:47.660]  him on the plane and learned that it was the CIA that came out in Congress
[26:47.660 --> 26:52.700]  months after we broke it that the CIA ordered him without any forms of proper
[26:52.700 --> 27:00.780]  ID without a visa without things like that to get him on the plane to the US and
[27:00.780 --> 27:06.460]  he was drugged up with a firecracker in his pants with a controller on board
[27:06.460 --> 27:12.700]  with a remote control to detonate it they even had a guy sitting there the
[27:12.700 --> 27:17.540]  hour before with a camera on Mutalib videotaping the entire thing in case
[27:17.540 --> 27:21.260]  they wanted to use that for promotional fair mongering one week before they
[27:21.260 --> 27:24.100]  rolled out all the naked body scanners that they claim they ordered because of
[27:24.100 --> 27:28.340]  that which they've actually put orders in a year plus before I mean this was a
[27:28.340 --> 27:34.380]  public rollout advertising campaign they don't even hide it we had the
[27:34.380 --> 27:37.860]  whistleblower on that instantly and I just sort of come to the realization
[27:37.860 --> 27:42.460]  every time now we have whistleblowers every time we have witnesses that turn
[27:42.460 --> 27:46.180]  out to be accurate now we have the federal SWAT teams going public to the
[27:46.180 --> 27:50.900]  BBC but then I was contacted and given the full scoop because BBC didn't go with
[27:50.900 --> 27:56.660]  it by the way the SWAT team contacted but the NSA knows what are you gonna
[27:56.660 --> 27:59.940]  prosecute them for being told to stand down they don't care they're sick of it
[27:59.940 --> 28:05.540]  I'm told they contacted 50 plus outlets trying to get it out turns out it had
[28:05.540 --> 28:08.100]  been in our box and I just hadn't seen it and they were scanning through and
[28:08.100 --> 28:12.820]  found it then we made contact because they were like default their job was to
[28:12.820 --> 28:15.300]  go in they happen to be right by it when it happened they were told to stand
[28:15.300 --> 28:19.620]  down boom they went public that's their duty not just their their their right
[28:19.620 --> 28:22.980]  their duty because you become complicit that's what they said we are
[28:22.980 --> 28:26.020]  already complicit we're we're thinking we should have just ignored the order
[28:26.020 --> 28:31.140]  absolutely absolutely you got somebody in there killing people you're told to
[28:31.140 --> 28:35.540]  stand down you're trained all day to go in and kill them kill them stop following
[28:35.540 --> 28:40.980]  illegal orders but the first step is blowing the whistle the first step is
[28:40.980 --> 28:44.180]  blowing the whistle ladies and gentlemen and the first step is not
[28:44.180 --> 28:48.820]  following illegal orders criminal orders and now we have whistleblowers
[28:48.820 --> 28:54.900]  coming out from the police force in Nairobi Kenya that they were people are
[28:54.900 --> 28:58.580]  told not to go in that day and there was some type of weird stuff going on and
[28:58.580 --> 29:02.500]  thank god there was a royal marine in there that was packing his gun illegally
[29:02.500 --> 29:05.300]  and help run him off because they thought hey we're safe come in and kill
[29:05.300 --> 29:09.540]  whoever we want the government is part al-qaeda in Kenya now because of
[29:09.540 --> 29:14.260]  odinga obama's cousin on record now six years ago getting into prime minister
[29:14.260 --> 29:17.140]  ship which they created for him they only had a president before and then he
[29:17.140 --> 29:23.140]  brought in out of Somalia hundreds and hundreds of thousands of radicals folks
[29:23.140 --> 29:27.220]  Somalia that's the new globalist invasion force to take over Kenya
[29:27.220 --> 29:31.220]  the muslim extremists are the secret army of the new world order
[29:31.220 --> 29:34.820]  you've heard dr. Jerome course he break it down it's a fact folks

[39:35.860 --> 39:41.540]  i want to get your take on the fact that on every case now
[39:41.540 --> 39:44.260]  the kenyan government blows the whistle that they were pre-worn it looks
[39:44.260 --> 39:47.860]  suspicious elements of it the SWAT team the ATF
[39:47.860 --> 39:52.020]  blows the whistle not just the DC SWAT team the federal
[39:52.020 --> 39:56.100]  capital SWAT team but the ATF blows the whistle and says we're mad we've
[39:56.100 --> 39:59.060]  been told we can't go in when it's our jurisdiction
[39:59.060 --> 40:02.100]  you've got
[40:03.060 --> 40:07.060]  you've got sigh hersh coming out saying the whole bin laden rage totally fake
[40:07.060 --> 40:11.140]  that's up on info wars dot com
[40:11.620 --> 40:18.660]  i mean this is this is just wild yeah there's the article up on drudge
[40:18.660 --> 40:25.540]  from the guardian seymour hersh obama nsa and the pathetic american media
[40:25.540 --> 40:28.660]  and then below it info wars dot com bin laden raid
[40:28.660 --> 40:32.980]  one big lie and then as he drudges really smart
[40:32.980 --> 40:36.020]  and his crews really smart the way they do things i'm trying to learn from them
[40:36.020 --> 40:39.460]  because they they know that a mainstream news article like the guardian
[40:39.460 --> 40:42.900]  will have buried in it that hersh is saying it's totally fake that's buried
[40:42.900 --> 40:46.580]  in the article about seymour hersh on obama nsa and the pathetic american
[40:46.580 --> 40:51.460]  media obviously the bombshell news is that sigh hersh from his sources
[40:51.460 --> 40:54.980]  is saying it's total baloney i mean that's huge
[40:54.980 --> 40:58.260]  sigh her says that the raid's all fake of course we know it's fake the whole
[40:58.260 --> 41:01.540]  thing's a lie i've talked to the navy seals
[41:01.540 --> 41:04.900]  i mean i get i think god this is coming out i'll tell you why i'm so happy i
[41:04.900 --> 41:09.460]  just psychoanalyze myself you know how scary it was
[41:09.460 --> 41:14.260]  when i talked to this navy seal who was a full grown man been the navy seals for
[41:14.260 --> 41:17.380]  many years tough guy you know probably beat up ten of
[41:17.380 --> 41:21.140]  me just from all the combat they've been in the focus
[41:21.140 --> 41:27.940]  was scared telling me this scared i mean shaking and and you know you
[41:27.940 --> 41:31.620]  could see not appear a fear let's hear of adrenaline telling me this
[41:31.620 --> 41:36.180]  information a week after it happened and i i left i had to pull over
[41:36.180 --> 41:39.780]  at cabela's of all places because i was going to see family
[41:39.780 --> 41:43.300]  and i had to shoot a video right then and i shot a video in the parking lot of
[41:43.300 --> 41:47.140]  cabela's in my charger dodge charger about the info i had
[41:47.140 --> 41:50.740]  and i wasn't even at liberty then to say i'd been told this later
[41:50.740 --> 41:54.260]  i was told okay you can say you heard it from a navy seal and then of course you
[41:54.260 --> 41:58.020]  saw it all come out i mean this the the the reason i'm happy that more people
[41:58.020 --> 42:01.220]  are talking about this is because folks it's dangerous
[42:01.220 --> 42:04.820]  to be the only people that know this stuff
[42:04.820 --> 42:08.660]  and to see these criminals get away with this stuff is very upsetting when you
[42:08.660 --> 42:11.940]  know it's as phony as a three dollar bill from one end to the other
[42:11.940 --> 42:17.460]  and the navy seals know it's fake day one because i know how they run these
[42:17.460 --> 42:21.060]  operations toll free number to join us eight hundred two five nine ninety two
[42:21.060 --> 42:26.100]  thirty one eight hundred two five nine nine two three one
[42:26.100 --> 42:29.620]  day one we went and shot a video i mean it was a what was it a sunday night or
[42:29.620 --> 42:32.260]  whatever he announced it in the in the monday morning memory service
[42:32.260 --> 42:35.700]  i came in did reports those videos have millions of views online
[42:35.700 --> 42:39.300]  and we said look the situation room photo looks completely fake it's clearly
[42:39.300 --> 42:43.860]  staged uh they probably sent the seals in
[42:43.860 --> 42:49.220]  for a look alike they had set up uh and then they probably had another team
[42:49.220 --> 42:51.140]  there that actually killed some of the people
[42:51.140 --> 42:55.460]  and then that's probably why they blew up the helicopter was to create confusion
[42:55.460 --> 42:58.900]  and try to get rid of the seal team that was actually loading bin laden
[42:58.900 --> 43:03.300]  or who they thought was bin laden on the helicopter
[43:03.300 --> 43:07.620]  and then basically that's what came out
[43:07.620 --> 43:11.060]  and i just don't understand how i understand how these people operate but
[43:11.060 --> 43:14.660]  i've just watched them so long and then it turned out they had like a record
[43:14.660 --> 43:18.500]  number of court marshals it was somehow outrageous like 70 plus people
[43:18.500 --> 43:23.300]  in the first wave on the ship because they were all witnesses that there was
[43:23.300 --> 43:26.740]  no body thrown in the ocean there was no ceremony it was all bull
[43:26.740 --> 43:29.940]  that later came out that's why they were targeted and now they've gone public
[43:29.940 --> 43:34.580]  and it's been in the news that no one saw the burial it didn't happen
[43:34.580 --> 43:39.460]  the situation room photo was fake there wasn't a live feed
[43:39.460 --> 43:43.700]  it was all staged and i told the navy seals at the time i said
[43:43.700 --> 43:49.060]  if they blew up this helicopter to cover up the evidence
[43:49.060 --> 43:52.820]  when they loaded the body on and got some of the guys on the stealth helicopter
[43:52.820 --> 43:55.540]  and reportedly it didn't take them out like they wanted they got they rolled
[43:55.540 --> 43:58.100]  out and got on the ground that's why that was a big freak out there was
[43:58.100 --> 44:01.540]  survivors so that then got back to the rest of seal team six so they had to
[44:01.540 --> 44:05.780]  load them all up on a helicopter and go blow it up
[44:05.780 --> 44:10.740]  and that's when well well well one week after i had a source in the navy seals
[44:10.740 --> 44:13.700]  to be technical that said the whole thing's very suspicious we're told
[44:13.700 --> 44:17.060]  it's pure bull then a month later whatever it was the
[44:17.060 --> 44:21.860]  helicopter blew up and they killed 23 of them as well as other personnel
[44:21.860 --> 44:25.860]  that's when i was able to meet with someone i'll just leave it at that
[44:25.860 --> 44:29.300]  who told me well first i was able to meet with their father
[44:29.300 --> 44:34.340]  and then i was able to meet with them and it's so drilled into these people to
[44:34.340 --> 44:37.700]  never talk about what they know that it's almost like mind control
[44:37.700 --> 44:41.140]  programming for them to speak out that's why tosh plumley on the show a few
[44:41.140 --> 44:44.020]  days ago that guy's a famous whistleblower
[44:44.020 --> 44:48.420]  but still works for the cia because there's a white side
[44:48.420 --> 44:53.300]  dark side of it as they call it telling you he talked to a nato high-level
[44:53.300 --> 44:56.100]  officials who said no the u.s was shipping the guns
[44:56.100 --> 44:59.860]  in delivia not just giving them qaddafi french-made
[44:59.860 --> 45:03.060]  anti-aircraft missiles and anti-tank missiles and chinese
[45:03.060 --> 45:06.740]  anti-tank uh red arrows that was that that was happening too
[45:06.740 --> 45:14.180]  they were giving them quote high impact weapons
[45:16.820 --> 45:20.900]  armor piercing really serious stuff that'll take out abram's tanks all day
[45:20.900 --> 45:23.300]  that'll blow helicopters and jets out of the sky
[45:23.300 --> 45:26.900]  i was talking to him off air he just said i can't say i've signed agreements but
[45:26.900 --> 45:30.580]  he goes look man i'm on the runway getting ready to take off
[45:30.580 --> 45:33.940]  at a military base and there was times on air you could hear the c-130s and
[45:33.940 --> 45:37.060]  stuff they were being loaded up with weapons he's in the lead aircraft he's
[45:37.060 --> 45:42.260]  flying the weapons over there folks he's sitting here watching him delivered
[45:42.260 --> 45:46.100]  into warehouses to jihad he says basically the info
[45:46.100 --> 45:48.900]  and he said look let me just tell you this read between the lines so i'm not
[45:48.900 --> 45:51.380]  letting something out that was given to me in confidence
[45:51.380 --> 45:55.220]  that's how they give you this info and let me jim mars wasn't even talking on
[45:55.220 --> 45:58.500]  the show and was shaking last week when i talked to him before this
[45:58.500 --> 46:01.860]  he said but but of course no one even cares it's not even a big issue it's
[46:01.860 --> 46:07.140]  all just hidden in plain view but you'll hear about it later down the road
[46:07.780 --> 46:11.620]  jim mars wanted me to get this on air because he's known tosh since the
[46:11.620 --> 46:16.900]  70s with the frank church hearings in congress
[46:16.900 --> 46:22.500]  where mk ultra and all the stuff came out gulfa tonkin first started coming out
[46:22.500 --> 46:27.300]  there i mean just everything came out we almost cleaned the government up then
[46:27.300 --> 46:30.260]  that was right after nixon and all that you know when america was ready to
[46:30.260 --> 46:33.060]  start waking up
[46:33.460 --> 46:39.540]  and mars is like listen you got to get him on quit for our safety
[46:39.540 --> 46:43.220]  i mean that was the real reason he's telling me all this is dangerous
[46:43.220 --> 46:47.860]  can you get us on you know today that i guess that was friday morning
[46:47.860 --> 46:51.300]  and by the time i called him he couldn't get tosh on and then we talked over the
[46:51.300 --> 46:54.260]  weekend and then my phone got wiped because my mom thought it was hers was
[46:54.260 --> 46:57.780]  putting her code in it at the beach with the kids and then i finally got back
[46:57.780 --> 47:02.820]  with him monday got him on tuesday but um
[47:02.820 --> 47:05.940]  and they're in contact fox news is in contact with him
[47:05.940 --> 47:09.620]  but the point here is that this is really dangerous
[47:09.620 --> 47:12.980]  so that's why i'm psychoanalyzing myself why i get so excited
[47:12.980 --> 47:15.940]  when cy hearse comes out and says the bin laden raid was fake
[47:15.940 --> 47:19.540]  and when the uh elements of the kenyan government come out and say you know
[47:19.540 --> 47:22.820]  we knew that was prior knowledge and the swat team comes out and says we were
[47:22.820 --> 47:26.100]  ordered to stand down in dc and the atf comes out and basically says there's a
[47:26.100 --> 47:30.020]  cover up and it's everything the criminals do now is coming out
[47:30.020 --> 47:34.260]  because people now understand how much danger we're all in the danger is not
[47:34.260 --> 47:37.860]  infighting these people there's a danger there but it's a lot
[47:37.860 --> 47:41.940]  less than letting them run everything i've told you this a thousand times
[47:41.940 --> 47:44.500]  this new world order is not like boss hog that's
[47:44.500 --> 47:50.420]  eaten you know hamburgers and barbeque in his back office and skimming off the
[47:50.420 --> 47:53.380]  top and you know flash is sitting there on the
[47:53.380 --> 47:58.260]  leather couch farting and erosco pico trains you know out there with a fake
[47:58.260 --> 48:04.260]  radar gun that's really a hair dryer this isn't just average corruption this
[48:04.260 --> 48:07.940]  is cancer ladies and gentlemen and we're not going to survive it
[48:07.940 --> 48:12.100]  our prosperity our posterity
[48:13.380 --> 48:17.780]  all of us our entire future is is is degenerating and going down the rat
[48:17.780 --> 48:20.820]  hole if we don't slow things down and and then
[48:20.820 --> 48:24.180]  reverse them and we have slowed things down brzezinski admits that
[48:24.180 --> 48:27.860]  hillary admits that at cfr meetings they're scared and they should be
[48:27.860 --> 48:31.380]  they're legendary tyrants and just like hitler and musolini and
[48:31.380 --> 48:35.380]  so many others they think they're invincible they think they're above the
[48:35.380 --> 48:39.060]  law they think they'll never get caught they
[48:39.060 --> 48:44.580]  think they'll never get stopped but sooner or later

[49:25.540 --> 49:30.660]  no king but king jesus also um i wanted to say alex that you know
[49:30.660 --> 49:34.820]  it's very convenient that now we get a photo a picture of this navy yard
[49:34.820 --> 49:37.380]  shooter but yeah we still can't get a picture of adam
[49:37.380 --> 49:40.500]  lands as supposedly in sandiac this whole thing is
[49:40.500 --> 49:43.460]  spake everything is being staged all of it
[49:43.460 --> 49:46.500]  yeah they're they're saying they don't want to release what drugs he was on
[49:46.500 --> 49:49.380]  because people might not take their ssri's we know he was on three his
[49:49.380 --> 49:53.060]  family's gone public friends and family have said he was on a bunch of stuff
[49:53.060 --> 49:57.060]  they knew of three drugs he'd been on put it to you that way that that came out
[49:57.060 --> 50:00.420]  right after it happened a few weeks after and uh
[50:00.420 --> 50:04.180]  yeah there was a drill there was the local SWAT team from the jurisdiction
[50:04.180 --> 50:09.300]  over a federal task force local group and the whole thing does look
[50:09.300 --> 50:12.580]  staged uh what type of stage we don't know boss
[50:12.580 --> 50:15.620]  and bombing totally staged uh and it's all blowing up in their
[50:15.620 --> 50:18.500]  face i mean it's it's all blowing up in their face but uh
[50:18.500 --> 50:21.460]  yeah the whole navy yard thing is very suspicious now they're going to release
[50:21.460 --> 50:24.260]  the 911 tapes i guess it's taking them nine months
[50:24.260 --> 50:28.340]  to produce that uh so there you go
[50:28.340 --> 50:32.420]  well listen it matches their agenda Alex it only stands to reason that if they
[50:32.420 --> 50:35.700]  wanted to outlaw ar-15 or m4 variant rifles
[50:35.700 --> 50:39.060]  but they would show a picture of this crazed lunatic in a school
[50:39.060 --> 50:41.620]  not necessarily showing the kids getting shot or anything but just showing them
[50:41.620 --> 50:44.900]  with this type of gun it matches their agenda yet they don't have the photo
[50:44.900 --> 50:47.780]  they will not show it
[50:47.780 --> 50:51.300]  well that's because they probably shot lands in the back of the head
[50:51.300 --> 50:55.060]  and had a contractor kill the kids and then they had actors
[50:55.060 --> 50:58.180]  clearly the clearly some of them are being actors come out and push the

[54:53.540 --> 54:58.660]  kathleen and canada you're on the air welcome hi alex
[54:58.660 --> 55:01.300]  hey to talk to you thank you for calling i'm just
[55:01.300 --> 55:04.660]  thanks i'm just wondering if you've seen the press conference this morning with
[55:04.660 --> 55:10.580]  the newly elected um iranian president it was in new york city
[55:10.580 --> 55:13.220]  i am aware that he was going to give a press conference then and then
[55:13.220 --> 55:17.060]  reportedly meet with obama soon uh but no i didn't follow it in fact i should be
[55:17.060 --> 55:21.780]  following and it's in my stack what happened well there was a press conference
[55:21.780 --> 55:25.060]  and one of the um like i think it was cnn journalists
[55:25.060 --> 55:28.980]  asked him what he thinks about the whole like west and east and everything else
[55:28.980 --> 55:32.980]  and he said the only way to help syria is to get the terrorists and he
[55:32.980 --> 55:36.660]  actually said the word al-qaeda in the west to stop helping al-qaeda and get
[55:36.660 --> 55:40.020]  them all out of there so the the coalition can have talks with the
[55:40.020 --> 55:42.980]  government oh yeah no it's been in the foreign press
[55:42.980 --> 55:46.660]  der spiegel london guardian for two and a half years that our government with
[55:46.660 --> 55:49.300]  nato has been putting al-qaeda in there and the
[55:49.300 --> 55:52.740]  Saudis have been paying for it and remember two years ago the media would
[55:52.740 --> 55:56.260]  say we were conspiracy terrorists now it's all admitted again their big lie
[55:56.260 --> 55:58.180]  doesn't work anymore and i didn't know that but
[55:58.180 --> 56:03.860]  guys search uh new uh just search iranian president it'll be the top story
[56:03.860 --> 56:07.140]  i mean i know he was scheduled to give a press conference and i i saw it in my
[56:07.140 --> 56:09.540]  stack but i didn't follow that i should have
[56:09.540 --> 56:12.260]  and you know they're calling for peace with the u.s and i'm not saying the
[56:12.260 --> 56:16.100]  mulas are great i don't agree with a lot of stuff they do but i'd like to see
[56:16.100 --> 56:20.260]  everybody try to move towards detente and not have a nuclear war
[56:20.260 --> 56:23.460]  and yes that is the party line of the iranians
[56:23.460 --> 56:29.220]  is to point out that it is wahhabist al-qaeda saudi arabian qatari terrorist
[56:29.220 --> 56:33.380]  that started the civil war in syria and it is a war crime
[56:33.380 --> 56:37.780]  that our government has been involved in it and i want our country to repudiate
[56:37.780 --> 56:40.500]  it so it's not on us if we repudiate it
[56:40.500 --> 56:43.700]  and do the right thing the world will love us again
[56:43.700 --> 56:48.020]  but instead they think we're so dumb our government's funding al-qaeda
[56:48.020 --> 56:52.500]  while taking our rights because of the threat of al-qaeda
[56:52.500 --> 56:55.780]  and that's pretty much what the iranian president said straight up al-qaeda
[56:55.780 --> 56:58.740]  he's like we need to get the terrorist so we can actually start talking and
[56:58.740 --> 57:02.420]  making some peace god bless you ma'am thank you for

[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:23.140]  your voice again good to be on alex nice to hear you it's been since spring and i've gotten in i
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:29.380]  think about 50 rounds of golf since the last time we talked oh good so you've gotten in 50 rounds of
[01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:39.940]  golf wow i like the golf alex hey uh i would golf if i was better at it i don't care when you get my
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:46.020]  age i'm 62 now it's the only damn sport you can do anymore and who have you been rooting for
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:53.460]  on what golf yeah oh i don't know i i i i i wrote i wrote against all the guys that used the long
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:11:00.020]  putters i'll put it to you that way because that's an illegal club the rules of golf say
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:06.100]  you must the club you must swing it well that's anchored so i always root against their nice
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:11.460]  people don't get me wrong but i just always root for the conventional people who put the old way
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:18.740]  what is your handicap on a standard course i'm about a 15 or 16 i'll shoot i'll shoot in the
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:24.340]  mid to upper 80s if i'm playing pretty good if i go into the 90s i'm not playing so good
[01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:29.460]  yeah i want to take up golf again because i grew up on a golf course and my dad was always pretty
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:33.460]  good but i just haven't had time and now i go out to the golf course with friends and it is embarrassing
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:38.260]  but i i guess that's part of a sport you know it's like anything you do in the world you must
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:43.300]  practice if you're gonna shoot pool you gotta shoot pool you know i don't mean if you're gonna play
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:48.580]  ping pong you gotta practice anything you do requires practice to be good at it i heard you've
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:59.300]  gotten pretty good at surfing oh i wouldn't say that not in comparison to the guys out there in
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:05.140]  the world i've not pretty good oh by the way i forgot to tell you this last time i talked uh
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:09.380]  dave mustain and willy nelson us went out to dinner we just happened to run into willy nelson
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:13.540]  and went out to dinner with him he uh willy nelson said the first thing he says how's the governor
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:18.580]  say he wanted me to say hi to you oh absolutely give really my best there's another true american
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:24.820]  dude who's come up to you know working the honky tonks all the way to super stardom and i don't
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:28.500]  think it's ever gotten to his head well you know why i don't think it did him he comes from just
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:33.860]  right here in texas and reminds me a lot of my dad kind of the same cloth but uh he didn't get big
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:39.540]  and and literally you know had to sell famous songs for like 50 bucks some of the most famous
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:44.500]  country songs out there to buy baby diapers as he said he didn't really become successful
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:52.420]  till he was about 50 yeah yeah don't really really really and i when we spent the day together
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:59.940]  had so much fun talking about his early music career compared to my early wrestling career
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:06.660]  and it's amazing uh the tie ins of the same type of feelings and the same i mean i remember
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:16.340]  i remember wrestling once where i had to drive 620 mile round trip right 310 each way and i paid
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:22.900]  for my own gas and i ate dinner at the a and w and at the end of the night i got a 30 dollar
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:29.780]  pay off and it and it cost me 28 bucks so i made two dollars and i worked for over 16 hours
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:35.220]  calling to drive it by the way i'm glad you brought that up we had uh rowdy rowdy piper
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:39.460]  on and he had a lot of good things to say about you it's the 25th anniversary of the hit movie
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:46.020]  they live and the last time i saw you guys together was in major league two wasn't it no no rowdy and
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:53.300]  i did a pilot together uh that got that up and then canceled at the last moment uh i forget i
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:56.660]  can't even remember sure but i'm saying the last time i saw you guys together on the big screen
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:03.380]  uh i don't know uh when it would have been you did like a mock trailer i think it was in major
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:07.460]  league two wasn't it uh but that didn't have nothing to do with rowdy rowdy wasn't in that
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:12.820]  okay one of the i was with all my reps on that that's right you know how it is everything just
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:21.620]  mixes together over time you corrected me though okay shifting gears into more serious subjects
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:26.900]  yeah let's talk about the book and and first off the fact that they say 50 years later
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:31.300]  no one's allowed to be in that area of downtown unless you're invited and believe the official
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:38.180]  story what is this north korea well it's it's ridiculous it's again you know i've come to
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:45.060]  determine alex it's this simple someone could produce a film today if somebody shooting from the
[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:51.380]  grassy knoll and mainstream media wouldn't cover it because i saw that completely when i went to
[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:58.260]  chicago and i met judith very baker who was lehigh v oswald's mistress in new Orleans his lover
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:06.660]  uh oswald was separated from marina and uh and judith who couldn't who has some of the most
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:15.460]  explosive stuff the fact that jack will be newly harvey oswald since oswald was a child the guy
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:22.420]  who killed him knew him wow knew him well she went to dinner with them on multiple occasions
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:30.660]  he knew him as sparty rupenstein you know his real name and he shortened it to jack ruby later
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:37.540]  and uh and we went imagine jesse went to a governor of minnesota and her calling a press
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:46.420]  conference in chicago and one camera showed up that shows that people know to keep their mouths
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:51.220]  shut normally you have a press conference there may be 20 cameras there it shows you also the
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:58.500]  mainstream media and this is what it gets down to they've been bristling us for 50 years on this
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:05.380]  they're not about to now show something that shows they've deceived and lied to us so they're
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:11.700]  going to continue with the with the oswald story and all the rest of us they're going to marginalize
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:18.900]  us i'm noticing already on this press tour i'm not getting much mainstream media in the book
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:25.460]  with this book very much less limited fox news of course won't have me out of that
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:29.940]  sure so you're saying the stuff you've got lined up for next week that you're seeing a lot less
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:34.820]  i mean you would think with the fifth anniversary you get even more coverage yeah no nothing nothing
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:43.460]  i'd like good morning america nothing on the networks nothing on msnbc uh beyond peers beyond
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:50.820]  howard stern uh it's only the people with some courage you know who are willing to go out there
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:58.180]  and seek the truth but as far as the rest of the mainstream media uh again when i was with jude
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:04.500]  the baker who could have told them that oswald ruby knew each other intimately you know it wasn't
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:11.380]  just some passing high i met it the guy once the and you know and that's a dynamite that's a bombshell
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:18.980]  that changes the whole thing that the murderer of oswald knew him and yet the media could care
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:24.740]  less about it well it's on record i've talked to jim mars who has been around so long he used to go
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:31.060]  to that topless bar right out of college and knew jack ruby and knew all those people and it was
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:36.820]  known that oswald hung out there constantly well he wasn't constantly there but he was involved with
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:43.540]  them enough that the it would be it would be the type where a lot of people do him help we show in
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:48.900]  the book where there were four for the strippers for the dancers positively i guess no no i mean
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:54.260]  according to mars yeah but i mean according to mars oswald was in there i mean that was sure he
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:59.380]  was in there on many not a lot but i'm you know certainly enough occasions to where people got
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:05.140]  to know in there well according to mars that was one of the meetup places to do business and stuff
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:11.220]  yeah i don't i don't know jim jim is very knowledgeable again you know you know i quote him
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:16.980]  in this book you know we we had the good fortune doing this book to have all these resources
[01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:24.660]  at our disposal which we used and we put them in a great order of 63 reasons when you read we
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:30.740]  leave the book off with the cats and back them on people need to understand this alex true conspiracies
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:37.220]  took place the first conspiracy was that of the actual murder of our president and the second
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:45.860]  conspiracy was the cover-up of it and some people are in both some people are only in one you know
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:52.020]  and and i decided to leave the book off with the with the cats and back memo nicholas cats and back
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:58.020]  he was the acting attorney general on monday morning now bear in mind the president got killed
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:05.380]  on friday oswald got killed on sunday this is monday morning we have the i mean this isn't me
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:11.140]  making this up this is the memo from the acting attorney general because naturally bobby wasn't
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:17.380]  there his brother had just been killed he's not going to go to work monday and uh a member from
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:25.220]  his deputy in charge to linden johnson through his proper channels stating that we must convince
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:31.460]  the public that oswald had nobody working with him that he was completely alone and nobody else out
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:37.460]  in the world is loose right now that was part of this and the fact that we we must convince the
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:42.820]  public that if there would have been a trial he would have been convicted and then it goes on to
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:49.620]  even more stuff i mean what more of a smoking gun do you need that's the whole thing oh then it goes
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:57.940]  on to say you need to form a commission of top integrity people to and we can't allow any type
[01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:03.380]  of congressional or any other investigations to take place sure but later they failed and they
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:10.100]  did have a congressional committee and what they found 99 chance it was a conspiracy job in 1976
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:16.580]  the house select committee and this is another thing people failed to realize the government's
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:24.020]  last view of the murder of john f kennedy and its last response was that it was a highly probable
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:30.500]  that there was a conspiracy they wouldn't say but unequivocally there was that they said most
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:38.100]  probable and then they turn it over to the justice department and what happens to it nothing well let
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:42.260]  me tell you a brief story and this is on youtube i did the interview like now it's about five six
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:47.780]  years ago george norrie came to town we put on a big event thousands came out uh for 5 90 a.m our
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:54.740]  local affiliate k lbj the namesake of the president he actually used to own it and uh this distinguished
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:21:01.700]  older gentleman comes up with his distinguished son who was older and said i'm mr grody i own the
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:05.860]  funeral home and i want to tell you alex i came here because you're here i was up there you know
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:10.260]  signing stuff he said i'd like to do an interview i'm decided i'm i'm pretty old i'm but he was
[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:16.420]  still very sharp he said i only owned one funeral home then and he said they the fbi came in with
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:22.180]  lee arvey oswald put ink on his hand ink and then put it on the rifle in front of me and then told
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:26.740]  me shut up and then when they buried him there they came back a week later dug it up and basically
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:31.140]  ran off with the body and he came there in the morning it was all dug up and gone he and then
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:38.100]  i said to him and his uh he and his son i said all right well next week i'll come out to your home
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:42.580]  and it was up there in the hills overlooking you know big mansion because it turned out they
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:46.820]  owned one of the biggest funeral home chains in texas ended up being a very successful
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:53.780]  and i'm driving and and and and and they're not there now later learned on the way to meet us at
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:59.140]  their house a big truck came in and ran him off the road into the ditch and almost killed him jesse
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:04.900]  no kidding no that's true story really yep well you know recover that portion in the book because
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:10.580]  uh you know initially when the weapon was sent off to the fbi and then it came back there were no
[01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:16.260]  prints on it at all to be found and then learn beyond and then we do talk about that guy because
[01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:23.220]  uh you know he he did go public and it's in my book also that uh he verified that that oswald's
[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:29.220]  hand had uh he had uh what he called it all over it after they left yeah yeah they didn't just
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:34.660]  they didn't just because he broke it to me and it did he's a guy he said they didn't
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:39.940]  just take his hand and get it to put it on there they put it the prints on with ink he said right
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:44.580]  and it's just amazing and and and jesse imagine this and and maybe it's a coincidence but the
[01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:49.380]  family said that's it we're done this is very suspicious and then uh he was 90 he was like
[01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:54.100]  90 then i don't even know he's alive now he defined out very nice guy but he was sharp
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:59.860]  and he's and he said i'm ready to tell the truth of what happened and just you know a texan it's
[01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:05.860]  and then and then he got ran off the road with his wife coming to meet me to officially put it
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:12.900]  on the record well well you know they did the same thing to uh lee byers yep who was the gentleman
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:17.940]  that was in the tower at the railroad yard that day and saw the suspicious stuff behind the fence
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:24.980]  lee byers was later found dead in what allegedly was supposedly a one-tire accident but if you
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:31.380]  talk to the the chef doing the report the official report to actually show but he too was run off
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:35.460]  the road i know you know i'm probably more about the kennedy thing than i do because you focus on
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:41.780]  it more how many people does marz and others say died suspiciously after there's a huge amount we
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:48.420]  cover the most important one of the biggest we cover is berthito gallant oh yeah berthito gallant
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:54.420]  was the same syndicated column there's a big name from new york who went on the rampage
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:24:00.260]  when kennedy was killed and she wanted the truth she didn't buy it she's actually the only person
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:06.180]  that didn't a one-on-one interview with jack ruby and when she came out from that interview she
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:12.740]  stated i'm going to bust the kennedy assassination wide open well we cover a whole chapter of the
[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:20.340]  book on her and she went home she was murdered and all her transcripts that she had were stolen
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:26.100]  and she didn't get this she had been savvy and smart enough to make duplicate copies
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:33.220]  and her her friend had them a week later the friend died and hers were gone too unbelievable
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:39.460]  we cover that out in this book this book i'll tell you it's a fascinating read for people people
[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:45.940]  that love to read tom clancy and fence flinn and all that stuff they're all good don't get me wrong
[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:51.940]  i'm not not and those guys got great imaginations they're fantastic writers but what intrigues me
[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:57.220]  more about going after kennedy is the people are real you're not dealing with figments of
[01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:03.140]  imagination or anything you're dealing with real facts that went on and assembling the
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:09.700]  jigsaw puzzle is the real challenge fun part for me about it is because that's what it's like
[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:15.300]  it's like a huge jigsaw puzzle thrown on the floor and you have to take every bit of evidence
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:20.500]  and start piecing it together till you figure out what the picture is and then when the picture
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:27.220]  comes to you you get some closure because you truly understand that i do not believe leah v oswald
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:33.380]  ever fired a shot well clearly we know that he was basically ci sheep dipped he was at that secret
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:38.820]  base in japan he was sent to infiltrate the russians allowed back in after he supposedly had
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:43.220]  you know joined the russians i mean it's ridiculous he's hanging out with the white russian
[01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:48.900]  community well one of the easy reasons to you know that it's so is that one of the documents
[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:55.620]  they won't release even today is leah v oswald's tax return that's right and i mean how can that be
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:26:04.020]  national security how much money is national security and how much he made see they don't
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:09.220]  bear release it because if the trail led back to the government the paper trail of the money of
[01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:16.420]  being paid or that that again changes the whole scenario of what they told us and and you know
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:21.700]  to me there's no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the war and report is completely fraudulent
[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:28.900]  people need to understand when the government they when you allow them to investigate themselves
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:35.620]  that's putting the box right in the henhouse you know and i i realize it would be difficult how do
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:42.180]  you get an independent civilians to investigate the government but that's what needs to happen because
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:49.620]  when they form these commissions they're they're they're just a rubber stamp whatever the government's
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:56.500]  position is on whatever it might be and that's all that they do and yet then the government uses them
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:01.380]  as the final thing that and then they won't answer any more questions on the subject because
[01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:08.340]  the war and commission said it the 9-11 commission said it whatever the commission might be that says
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:14.340]  that this is and they always come out exactly with the government's original story that's why
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:20.340]  they call it the official story alex it's generally used to protect officials well sure the old
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:26.020]  british uh saying no no you're right uh the old british saying is don't don't believe something
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:31.780]  until it's been officially denied yeah i mean it's so frustrating now we're about to go to
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:36.500]  break but i want to briefly ask you this about the general state of the country you've got 91
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:42.580]  percent in Reuters poll against openly bombing syria you've got it mainstream news that republicans
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:48.340]  and democratic leadership have been backing al-qaeda with nato to attack Assad i'm not saying he's an
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:53.140]  angel but they've started the war you've got you've got seymour hersch and london guardian today
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:59.060]  it's up on drudgereport.com uh says been lauding raid one big lie the whole thing's fake i've had
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:04.740]  navy seal families now officially on i actually got them to come on air and i've talked to others
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:09.060]  off air including people that live in austin but i've had the families on air and they've been on
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:14.660]  national news saying they think it's all fake and they put 23 of them on a helicopter blew them up
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:20.260]  none of it happened uh we've got it coming out that the the the dc swat team says they were ordered
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:26.580]  to stand down they think to cover up at the navy base my point is everything's coming out now
[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:33.700]  there was a drill with the boston bombing uh they uh executed you know some of the friends of the
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:39.300]  zarnab brothers my point is governor it looks like there's a mass awakening happening uh compared
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:45.140]  to what it used to be what is your take on the state of the public mind right now well you know
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:51.940]  first of all i let me add something that i learned about the syria situation uh the bottom
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:57.140]  that this stuff on chemical weapons and the use of them and all that that's a that's a red herring
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:03.620]  that's smoking mirrors the reason that i as i understand it from the information i've gotten
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:09.700]  is that the old companies want to run a pipeline through syria the side's not being cooperative
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:16.020]  yeah the israelis admit that to overthrow him to do the cooperative government in there that will
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:20.980]  allow the pipeline to go through and because i always follow the money you know i'm a great
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:27.620]  follower of major general smetley butler and uh that's who i really judge when i look at our foreign
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:33.220]  policy then i go to smetley's work general butler's work and i compare it to satan what do i think
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:39.620]  smetley butler would say about this well said and and clearly again they're not going to show you
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:44.580]  all the rules are conducted so that certain people get stay right there governor we gotta go to break
[01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:52.340]  stay there i want you to come back with that we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on

[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:32.980]  for minnesota governor with us they killed our president 63 reasons to believe there was a conspiracy
[01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:39.540]  to assassinate jfk and uh hopefully it'll become a bestseller because people need to be
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:45.060]  woken up out there about the coup d'etat that took over our country governor we were starting to get
[01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:49.860]  into war before we went to break and i want to get back into war but because we're on the subject
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:55.060]  of jfk with the fifth anniversary coming up before we get back into war i want to ask you here today
[01:34:56.340 --> 01:35:00.100]  do you agree with me and others that this is when we really saw the shadow government
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:05.540]  begin its ongoing coup d'etat for me that's why this is historically so important this is when
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:12.660]  our country really started to become a tyranny i i agree uh completely i at least in my lifetime
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:20.100]  granted i was only 12 years old when this happened but uh i i agree alex that it was the murder of
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:26.180]  john f kennedy it was a coup d'etat uh people in this country got to stop being in denial and they
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:32.660]  got to start realizing that assassinations of presidents happen all the time through history
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:38.900]  and the generally there are always conspiracies there's not one person that does it and and
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:44.100]  it's ridiculous in this country that every assassination that takes place in this country
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:51.060]  it's always a lone nut and it's always done to a person who stands for peace john f kennedy
[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:57.380]  robert kennedy martin luther king john lennon all four of them stood for what peace
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:05.140]  ending a war great transition into war isn't it alex it's a perfect transition into war
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:10.660]  you got cut off by the music so i'd like you to recap and continue uh where you were going governor
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:17.060]  with war wars are fought i follow the teachings of major general smudley butler the two-time
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:23.140]  congressional medal of honor winner and he makes it very clear that wars are are fought because
[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:29.220]  someone's going to profit wars are done for profit certain people are going to make huge money
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:35.060]  and they manipulate everything and enforce the hands and make these wars happen they don't just
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:41.140]  happen because people don't get along it's orchestrated and in well here's what i believe
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:46.980]  and what i've learned through on syria the oil companies want to put a pipeline through there
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:52.500]  and Assad's not being cooperative so it's in their best interest to overthrow his government
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:56.980]  get in a cooperating government so they can get their pipeline through and that all this
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:37:03.860]  chemical weapons stuff is to smoke and mirrors to get the u.s people to back in for our military
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:09.700]  to go in there i mean when you look at chemical weapons i find it astounding the hypocrisy
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:17.140]  what is napalm napalm is a chemical weapon that burns you to a crisp in a matter of a second
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:25.380]  and we've been using it for 60 years that's right ours ours us using a chemical weapon okay
[01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:31.060]  but and don't get me wrong i'm not for chemical weapons i'm not for the weapons at all how about
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:36.580]  let's try peace a while imagine that silly concept that john lennon's saying about give
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:43.700]  peace a chance well the last time i saw you happen because we're a country of war brokers here
[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:48.980]  that's right the power of this country is the power to go to war that's why we're fighting
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:55.380]  wars all over the world and thank goodness if hopefully these polls are correct that 90 percent
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:38:00.500]  of us are saying take your war and go to hell with it oh it's more than that probably the polls 91
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:07.220]  percent in roiders but congresspeople republican and democrats said they were getting 100 200 300
[01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:14.020]  400 calls to one depending on which member put out the numbers against it across the board
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:18.660]  i almost had a heart attack when i heard rush limbaugh say this looked like a frame job
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:25.620]  false flag the last guy i heard say that on a big forum like that was yesy ventura last year
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:32.580]  on pierce morgan talking about syria you said that i'm looking for a false flag do you remember
[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:39.220]  a year ago saying that yeah yeah because uh and we're also going to have another fast flag locally
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:44.340]  so that they can clamp us down there here too you know they got to make us safe don't they
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:50.020]  exactly is that what your gut tells you oh yeah oh yeah well elaborate for new listeners so we
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:54.180]  have a lot of new affiliates out there on why every time you get on national tv you warn of
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:59.700]  false flags now explain people what a false flag is as a former military man well it's
[01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:05.140]  everyone it is it's not even military it's truthfully almost political too oh yeah it's
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:11.060]  when a country desires to do something they they do an operation called a false flag operation
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:18.260]  to to uh to use propaganda from that to get the people to support going to war support the
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:24.340]  position that they want to have happened which in the case of uh you know uh back in the days of
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:30.260]  the cuban missile crisis in cuba they had one of the first that came to light was the operation
[01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:35.780]  northwards which was a fast flag operation and were tied in with jack kennedy here it was a
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:40.980]  false flag operation where art the pentagon and all the power guys that wanted to go to war
[01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:48.340]  actually wanted to stage a fast flag where it would make it look like cuba attacked the united
[01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:54.180]  states which would then get the people of america angry enough that they would then be positive
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:40:00.100]  on an invasion of cuba and a military action against them it's been the rucksack fire in
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:06.900]  germany was a fast flag operation done by hitler and the nazis to get the german people behind
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:13.940]  the war against the communists fast flag operations go on all the time during our history and it's
[01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:20.660]  like standard operating procedure of how to go to war now uh the glass of tanken incident in vietnam
[01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:27.060]  another fast flag operation where they stated the vietnamese attacked us and and that's what
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:32.980]  justified linden johnson to send ground troops into vietnam according to these people and then
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:38.500]  later it comes out from mac de mire the thing was fraudulent it's hard to believe how it's
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:44.820]  hard to believe how time flies it was like seven years ago that i was interviewing you down in
[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:50.180]  san antonio when you were doing a public speaking and book signing and it was the first time i'd
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:58.260]  heard you uh you know really get into going to harvard i think it was and hearing uh mac numera
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:04.740]  who was defense secretary obviously in 64 openly admitting it was all fake can you can you bring
[01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:08.980]  us back to that point when you heard him for the first time fortunately i didn't get to do that they
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:16.980]  wouldn't let me go in there sure sure but i mean you said when you heard him say that well yeah mac
[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:23.300]  mac numera came out and in all his public speaking and basically admitted that the guy for tanken
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:29.380]  incident was a fast flag operation done to you know to change the minds of the emitters you
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:36.740]  know america somebody attacks us we're going to war we don't even think why all we need is for
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:42.580]  anybody to attack the united states of america in any way shape or form and you and we are going
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:47.460]  to war sure while i was going back i was going back to your anger i mean back then you you were
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:52.980]  you were palpably angry you said when you first of course because think about it for a moment and
[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:58.500]  we'll tie in with jack kennedy again when they murdered jack kennedy that was the license for
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:04.020]  lyndon his first meeting lyndon johnson when he got back to washington and that was kennedy's
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:09.620]  cabinet the first topic of conversation of the very first meeting was the vietnam war of which
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:15.780]  we didn't have ground troops there yet that's right so that was the top priority was now we've
[01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:21.620]  gotten rid of kennedy let's go to war let's go to war what kennedy wasn't going to let us do
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:27.700]  and lyndon johnson was all for it so into the vietnam war and what angers me about the gulf of
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:34.900]  tanken incident 58 000 of my generation were killed over an incident that never actually occurred
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:42.020]  and a million vietnamese oh yes i'm probably more than that that's conservative how many vietnamese
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:48.100]  died higher estimates hurt a million and a half yeah yeah i mean there's no telling how many poor
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:54.900]  vietnamese people died during the war that was all based on a lie sounds kind of familiar like the
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:43:01.380]  rat too doesn't it exactly but here's the good news mass destruction ties to al-qaeda and don't you love
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:09.860]  this now al-qaeda is our ally in syria how do you think they what do you think they were thinking
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:14.580]  when two and a half years ago they started funding al-qaeda to attack syria on selling us to give up
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:20.020]  our liberties because of al-qaeda while our government now publicly is funding and arming
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:25.620]  al-qaeda what is going on what it tells me is al-qaeda had nothing to do with 9 11
[01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:32.580]  how could we be how could we be the ally of the very people that allegedly attacked us on 9 11
[01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:38.340]  it's incredible let's go back to false flags here briefly again governor jessia intera joins us
[01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:42.820]  that's big that you're saying you're concerned about a domestic false flag i agree with you
[01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:49.460]  the only way they can distract the public from all the nsa scandals and and the irs persecuting
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:55.780]  the tea party and and uh fast and furious and all the other scandals is a false flag they're clearly
[01:43:55.780 --> 01:44:00.420]  gearing up for it they're saying brace for al-qaeda to strike us they're saying give homeland security
[01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:06.100]  more funding or you'll be attacked uh what can we do to try to then stop a false flag
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:14.020]  uh i don't know off the top of my head alex you know the main thing for people to be is
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:19.700]  vigilant don't take this knee-jerk reaction i mean look at your look at your mainstream media
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:25.220]  stories today when they come out on one of these tragedies you can't believe anything
[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:31.220]  i agree just look at look at the thing the stuff that's gone on with the look at the shooting that
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:37.940]  took place in connecticut for eight for ten hours they told us that the shooter's mom worked at the
[01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:46.980]  school no she didn't see the mainstream media just puts out propaganda to sell and get ratings
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:52.740]  and make money they don't bother did you listen the boston bombing governor the boston bombing
[01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:57.140]  they had a drill it was admitted and then they said no we didn't and then later had to admit it
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:02.420]  total false flag they had contractors with black backpacks they've had a bunch of witnesses have
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:07.700]  been killed i mean it looks like the kennedy assassination and has any of that been reported
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:14.580]  in mainstream media no no no the only place things like that get reported on your show
[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:20.260]  and quote unquote underground or the internet or whatever you want to deem it or label it
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:26.420]  let me ask you this mainstream media won't cover anything that does not have the government's
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:33.220]  stamp of approval on it i think people need to wake up to that and understand that they are i mean
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:41.060]  look at bill riley we i saw videotape from my friend russ baker showed it to me of bill
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:48.740]  riley on current affair demanding an investigation of jfk's murder this is way back in the eighties
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:54.980]  when new information had just come to light or riley's on the demanding that the government
[01:45:54.980 --> 01:46:00.020]  open up an investigate and tell us the truth about the murder of kennedy and yet today
[01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:07.620]  he writes a multi-million dollar best-selling book all putting forth the myth that oswald did it he
[01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:12.900]  didn't really that wasn't the reason for the book but it was a book on kennedy but the conclusion
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:18.740]  was of course and that's where riley stands today that oswald acted alone now what caused him to
[01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:26.180]  change his mind in those 25 years or 20 years money well it shows why the kennedy assassination
[01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:30.660]  is so important to the establishment because 90 plus percent in major polls as you know believe
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:36.180]  there's a conspiracy and a cover-up and and if that lie falls it all falls but the the dinosaur
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:42.180]  media already is a shadow of itself that's why they want to censor the internet and the free press
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:48.980]  and that brings us into the nsa cyber security we don't get an apology we get censored that's why
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:52.740]  they're scared to have you on the mainstream media now governor because you've been proven right you
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:58.020]  said the nsa spying on us it's all admitted now you said the wmds are a lie it's all admitted now
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:02.500]  you said our government's running al-qaeda it's all admitted now i mean on so many fronts we've
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:09.700]  been proven right that's why they're scared to have us on now but they're only but they're only
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:16.180]  making themselves obsolete so so where do you think this is all going well uh you know i i i can
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:22.820]  announce to you i guess today alex that i'm going to be getting my own internet show good so i would
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:29.220]  be on the internet and uh is which is a new realm for me now if moving forward doing that and uh
[01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:33.460]  considering i'm really computer ignorant when you want to get down to brass tacks but
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:40.580]  i do see that that the internet is the future uh pretty soon the internet's going to replace
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:45.780]  mainstream television i think within 10 to 15 years oh yeah it's already happening and and i
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:50.820]  don't think television will be the obvious your dinosaur that still has a big screen tv hoping
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:54.500]  to get the football game on sunday well no you just put your internet on the big screen tv but
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:57.540]  governor this is exciting because i had heard this are you breaking here now that you're
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:48:03.140]  going to start a radio show that's wonderful well it's it's but it's not just radio it's going to
[01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:10.580]  be visual too oh fantastic can you give us any details uh yeah i in order to i'll give you this
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:17.860]  detail do you remember i don't know alex if you're young enough or not but uh way back when in uh
[01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:25.700]  in uh uh earlier in my life they had what they called radio free america oh yes you're up
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:32.420]  with a broadcast over the iron curtain yes well that's good that's what i'm doing i'm going to do
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:38.180]  this show from a foreign country and i'm going to broadcast it into the united states that way
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:42.660]  i might be free of drug surveillance and i won't get arrested that's right so you're going to
[01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:47.620]  broadcast into occupied america the sharers against the wall i'm going to i'm going to broadcast
[01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:53.300]  over the lines back into occupied america and allow them to hear the truth that is a genius
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:58.420]  absolutely because that's what it is i mean it's not even a gimmick i'm in i'm in i'm
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:05.060]  and i'm joining a clientele that's marvelous with man jack that's right remember remember when
[01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:09.540]  there was that mystique that the wolf man was actually broadcasting from a foreign country
[01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:14.340]  because they wouldn't allow him to hear well what's exciting about this is i guarantee you if you
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:21.540]  carve it up into vignettes radio stations will pick it up and in tv stations well it's uh it's an
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:27.460]  exciting thing for me i'll be working the boss of the cunt of my company is uh uh interesting
[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:32.420]  fella he's from mexico city and it'll be fun to work for someone who's not from the united states
[01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:37.220]  see i can't hurt i can't get a job very good here in the state so i gotta go for him to get one
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:40.820]  well that's because they're scared of you and speaking of that would you uh run on a ticket
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:46.260]  with somebody like rand paul i don't know him well enough i know his father i've never met rand
[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:52.500]  i know i know his father ron and uh you know but would i run on a ticket with him i don't know
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:57.540]  i haven't thought of it i'll find out a lot more on wednesday when i hit new york with hollard stern
[01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:03.940]  but to see if it's been turned stern oh so there's talk about you running from from

[01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:18.660]  forty five all right final segment with jessie ventura and he was dropping bombshells on me
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:22.260]  during the break about howard stern they're serious about running for president uh we're
[01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:25.860]  going to talk about this in just a moment you'll find out more coming up next wednesday when he
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:31.460]  goes on howard's show but the issue here and i know you don't want to talk about it but i'm
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:35.300]  trying to get into it right now i know the inside baseball but it's even been in the news but back
[01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:42.740]  of the paper jessie ventura they lied and said that he said he's glad navy seals died and then he
[01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:48.660]  got beat up and there's no witnesses and he says okay i'm gonna retract this or also they won't
[01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:54.500]  retract he sues and says i'm going to keep suing till you admit that it isn't true no money just
[01:54:54.500 --> 01:55:00.980]  admit then they won't do that then chris kyle sadly is killed then the media says jessie ventura
[01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:06.260]  suing a widow she has insurance it's news core it's the book he's the one that's been
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:13.860]  defamed here and it's a hoax that he's going after a woman they have these fundraisers and
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:20.660]  all this for because the meanie ventura is trying to hurt her it's not true folks and she has not
[01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:26.580]  lost anything and will lose nothing because there's insurance through news core so the issue here is
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:32.260]  they've run a hoax so briefly it makes me mad governor and you told me off here that the lawsuit's
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:39.140]  going well yeah it's going well here's the deal with the wife the wife chose to be the executor
[01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:45.140]  of the estate and she knew farewell that this lawsuit was pending with the estate she didn't
[01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:50.820]  have to be the executor you can get a lawyer to do that you can get a friend an uncle anybody
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:58.340]  she made a choice to interject herself into this lawsuit by becoming the executor of the estate
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:04.740]  and i'm and and and i'm not going against her i'm going against a massive insurance companies
[01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:10.580]  i'm the little guy here i've had and it's cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:15.300]  and people are telling me i should drop it oh you told me the number it's huge who's
[01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:22.020]  going to pay me back well over a quarter of a million dollars that this has cost me and you
[01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:29.060]  gave them the chance my name you use my name of a fraudulent fabricated story that never occurred
[01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:35.700]  and that's the bottom line this has never been about money i've got my own money this has never
[01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:42.820]  been about money but if the other side will not admit to the fabrication will then money's the
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:48.580]  only thing that talks at that point i've been damaged by the way i i called you on skype in
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:54.740]  mexico to give you the bad news and you you didn't almost didn't believe me and and you and we're
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:57:00.500]  shaken and and and it's wrong to do things to people like this to try to destroy you so you
[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:04.500]  can't run for president now shifting gears in the two minutes we've got left tell me about the
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:10.740]  howard stern situation well howard and i i floated it by him and he had some interest in it and
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:15.780]  from the time we were there and we kind of got howard twinkle in his eye that and he said it
[01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:20.180]  might you know this and that and i'll be out there on wednesday and so wednesday i'm gonna
[01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:26.340]  point blank him and say i would i can't do it without you because there's certain things i need
[01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:32.100]  from howard to make this successful and one of the things is i despise raising the money the
[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:37.860]  bribing of the officials and all that and if i had someone like howard how much money could
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:42.900]  howard raise with his radio show and i wouldn't even i don't even want to know about it and it's
[01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:49.220]  not fcc regulated well and it certainly wouldn't be packed in special interest money you'd just
[01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:54.340]  make an appeal to everyday citizens well that's what it's supposed to be in the first place
[01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:58.660]  he could probably be done he could probably raise a hundred million dollars and then it
[01:57:58.660 --> 01:58:04.180]  wouldn't be beholden it'd be individual donations and uh xm serious is not under fcc regulations
[01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:10.100]  so he could keep a show while he ran for office absolutely there's always a method to my madness
[01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:15.620]  you know there's a reason i choose to do things like i do and i usually think them out pretty well
[01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:21.380]  and uh you know and believe me howard's a very intelligent man and uh you know people know him
[01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:27.460]  as the shock jock but there's other sides to howard stern not just his performing side remember
[01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:33.700]  that you know all of us perform people that are in the media industry we all turn it on and off like

[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:35.540]  going to get to it but we ran out of time he said a lot of it on there i kind of repeated it
[02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:41.940]  and then he agreed with me he told me he's in serious talks with howard stern to run for president
[02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:47.060]  and howard is vp to raise the money because ventura hates going around to the fundraisers and

[02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:15.380]  jesse and ventura called me back on skype right when he read the email that i had some bad news for
[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:22.020]  him and they needed to talk to myself or tyrell ventura well i got up here to the office when i
[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:25.940]  said try to give me a call on skype she doesn't have telephone down there in the bar but he has
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:30.820]  internet from a wireless deal that works sometimes and you heard him that sunday after i'd got him
[02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:35.860]  on the phone that sunday when he'd arrived i had him on the radio that sunday to talk about it later
[02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:40.420]  in the afternoon we taped an interview and i said yeah chris kyle you know the navy seal he says he
[02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:47.060]  punched you out for saying that you're glad that navy seals died he went alex man i just drove in
[02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:53.460]  here buddy he's a nice guy all fair kind of more gruff and stuff on there but he's like man what are
[02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:59.300]  you talking about and he was like what he said say that again and then i told him about it and told
[02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:04.660]  him what was on fox news he went huh i mean i can't really do the imitation of it because he had it
[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:10.500]  on speaker and his wife was there and she's like what and he's like when was this when did they say
[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:15.780]  this and he was sitting there just dumbfounded i mean i'm not describing it well the way he the way
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:23.540]  he took it but it was like i'd basically called up and told him somebody was dead because he's a
[02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:29.300]  smart guy he knew what that meant they were defaming him that he was glad navy seals were dead and
[02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:34.500]  they've now got a petition with former navy seals online you know he was in it was even called the
[02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:44.420]  navy seals the underwater demolition team to kick him out of it because uh of him suing chris kyle
[02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:51.940]  like he's going after a widow and i mean i knew that it wasn't true and and then we didn't just
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:56.340]  believe in turra we called the bar we talked to the other people folks that know and they said
[02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:59.860]  that's ridiculous everybody would have heard about that that's ridiculous he did that somebody
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:05.140]  would have gotten a fight with him if he said that he was there for a commencement and i've been
[02:03:05.140 --> 02:03:09.940]  around ventura when he talks to veterans and airports and stuff many times and he you know
[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:14.980]  he's a sentimental guy and you know gets tears in his eyes saying i think it's terrible he saw a vet
[02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:20.900]  that had his leg blown off on prosthesis in an airport and talked to him and got upset ventura
[02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:25.460]  gets pretty mad in person folks i mean he it's not an act the guy really does have a big temper
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:30.500]  which he controls he's very controlled about it i've seen him actually get mad at the tsa
[02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:39.780]  and i saw him really get shook up and uh say that he had to go and then he called me back later
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:45.700]  and we taped the interview uh and uh he told me that day said i'm gonna have to sue these people
[02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:52.420]  this is crazy and he's got all the navy seals lined up the owners the witnesses all of it but
[02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:57.940]  none of that's in the media so the thousands of navy seals that aren't there in san diego
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:04:02.980]  and who aren't in that area they don't even know that the people at the bar and all that know it
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:11.380]  never happened and chris kyle even writes in the book that he tells lies and and i'm not trying to
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:17.940]  myself to hurt some dead guy i'm sad he's dead uh but i just see all this promotion
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:24.740]  of how he's persecuting this widow and stuff when i happen to know what ventura spent he
[02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:31.060]  doesn't even want people to know folks it is a lot of money a lot a lot more than what you heard
[02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:39.300]  and he told him early on when he'd already spent 50 000 100 000 so i've got all the details he said
[02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:44.900]  you gotta stop lying and come out and say this is true kyle he's been in meetings with kyle
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:51.300]  he said man you're a liar you i'm gonna keep suing you do you understand how dare you and
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:57.460]  they won't stop and now kyle's dead and ventura is not gonna stop and the lawsuit's going forward

[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:21.380]  passes bill that funds obama care and we'll see if mitch mcconnell's right now they think it's going
[02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:26.980]  to be so horrible which it is that people are going to get mad it's going to cause a revolution
[02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:32.580]  in this country against socialism and collectivism i don't think that's going to happen my gut tells
[02:09:32.580 --> 02:09:39.060]  me because the the the new world order has done this other places and they know that the people
[02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:43.780]  who want to free ride are going to be conned again just like people in a casino just like people
[02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:49.540]  that buy lottery tickets they're going to say well next time it'll be better or the republicans
[02:09:49.540 --> 02:09:56.020]  messed it up and that's why we didn't get all this i mean everybody i know is having their
[02:09:56.020 --> 02:10:02.980]  premiums increased right now everyone including your strudely just got the notice in the mail
[02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:09.620]  two days ago from a genesis network because i have insurance through them um
[02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:17.220]  that i've got to pay more money now and i was talking to uh welden about his wife
[02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:24.580]  she has to pay way more it's something like 30 more he was saying and then that's it's less
[02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:30.020]  for women by the way for whatever reason when the actuaries and her deductible has doubled
[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:38.660]  or she works i'm not going to say where she works but the point is that everyone i know is getting
[02:10:38.660 --> 02:10:44.180]  the news uh and people that don't have insurance you're going to have to go out and buy it now
[02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:48.660]  or you're going to have to pay a five thousand dollar penalty
[02:10:51.220 --> 02:10:54.900]  people say good make these folks that don't have it get it to lower it for all of us
[02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:58.900]  folks there's always going to be people the 30 million illegals even more coming
[02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:03.140]  they're going to bankrupt the healthcare system this is how they partially collectivize something
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:06.980]  it starts going bankrupt and they say oh the answer is to fully collectivize
[02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:15.780]  that's the trap and by the way adan solazar just posted an article at info wars dot com
[02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:23.220]  that is so incredibly important insurance giants that wrote and lobbied for healthcare law cash in
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:28.580]  because adan heard me talking about the insurance companies writing it and he heard me talking
[02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:34.500]  yesterday about um he's a smart guy but i don't expect my writers to you know be fully immersed
[02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:38.500]  in all this like i am and what they do is i've told them i said you hear me making a claim
[02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:44.260]  and you think it's wild go look it up see if it's true and if i'm wrong come to me and they rarely
[02:11:44.260 --> 02:11:48.900]  come to me i'm glad when they do because i know about a problem and correct it so he since yesterday
[02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:53.700]  when he heard me talk about this he went and did a day's worth of research and he was freaked out
[02:11:53.700 --> 02:11:58.500]  this morning he goes oh my gosh they've made tens of billions some companies have made ten million
[02:11:58.500 --> 02:12:04.420]  dollars a piece just since it passed in their stocks going up and now they're set to make hundreds
[02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:09.220]  of billions and they wrote it there's all the proof where they're bragging he has the article in
[02:12:09.220 --> 02:12:14.740]  full wars dot com insurance giants that wrote and lobbied for healthcare law cash in top eight health
[02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:22.900]  insurance firms stocks rise since obama care implementation and they've got it from wlp and
[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:32.900]  the uh new york stock exchange blue cross blue shield boom up massively united health unh up
[02:12:32.900 --> 02:12:43.540]  massively look at that and in the three years since it's been in it has doubled doubled on average
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:47.860]  is about a 40 increase i mean we need to break down the actual numbers i think this has got to
[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:55.700]  be hundreds of billions already i mean health care is 170 economy uh look at these yeah most of them
[02:12:55.700 --> 02:13:03.620]  have doubled wow more than doubled for humana that's more than doubled more than doubled in the last
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:13.460]  three years since 2010 and now it's set to sky rocket you can just see it sky rocketing superior
[02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:21.620]  health plans sky rocketing oh man these foreign banks that own it i mean this is a gravy train
[02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:29.140]  and the us has the highest amount of money per gdp for health care and it's going to get worse
[02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:35.620]  they say it's set to double in the next three years just a cost i mean while they chemical
[02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:40.820]  weaponist bio weaponist and society collapses now they can control the care give you less care
[02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:48.980]  and charge you double i mean this is the gang rape con move of the of of all time i mean i've
[02:13:48.980 --> 02:14:02.420]  i've never seen something this devastating oh man small businesses are shutting down everywhere
[02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:07.460]  tens of millions what is it over 40 million have now been put to part time because of this
[02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:12.340]  it's going to get even worse everything's going to start shutting down and when it all totally
[02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:16.260]  collapses they're going to fully nationalize it where you're under government socials health care
[02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:22.740]  but the profits will be offshored and private ha ha ha whoo man i can want to hand it to the
[02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:31.460]  goldman sacks and jp morgan and the big banks and bank of england incredible devastating you
[02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:38.020]  have done it you have done it no one has ever put up with something that's this big of a screw
[02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:43.060]  job i have never heard of anything this out in the open i mean let me go further there's hundreds
[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:48.020]  of points there's four obama care will increase health spending seven thousand four hundred
[02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:53.700]  fifty dollars for a typical family of four and that's the government's own admissions oh but wait
[02:14:53.700 --> 02:15:01.460]  it gets even better if you do in the death panels uh don't uh make you uh happy and the government
[02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:08.740]  controlling uh the type of uh uh type of care you're going to get um when it goes fully socialist
[02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:14.340]  it's uh i don't know there's so many points my mind is just racing right now there this is so
[02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:25.460]  insane and the poor people going in as they phase out health care and as you don't get surgeries and
[02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:31.140]  you don't get taken care of and as ambulance services don't come after seven at night anymore
[02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:36.100]  and as the uh oh yeah here's the big one this is all written by the big insurance companies owned
[02:15:36.100 --> 02:15:42.180]  by foreign banks on record to shut down all of their competition the medium-sized clinics the
[02:15:42.180 --> 02:15:48.820]  hospitals it's all gone it's all gone there are clinics all over texas i just know because i was
[02:15:48.820 --> 02:15:55.460]  reading some of the testimony this year on it something like half of the medium-sized hospitals
[02:15:55.460 --> 02:16:00.260]  and clinics are announcing they're going to shut down or be sold to the big multinationals
[02:16:01.460 --> 02:16:06.420]  kind of like the feds come in with water quality regulations in the last decade written by foreign
[02:16:06.420 --> 02:16:12.820]  uh dutch and spanish and german companies mainly they're the main owners now of us water systems
[02:16:12.820 --> 02:16:18.020]  to where the local water system can't pay to upgrade all this useless expensive garbage
[02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:22.740]  so they come and say it's okay this company's ready to come in and buy it it's the same thing
[02:16:22.740 --> 02:16:26.100]  they're coming in with regulations that the globalists are all basically exempt from
[02:16:26.660 --> 02:16:32.260]  that will bankrupt everything and so you're going to have less health care you're going to have to
[02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:39.300]  go and get it rationed and it's going to be under government control so less hospitals less clinics
[02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:45.780]  less doctors less health care practitioners more basically government nurses the nurses that's why
[02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:49.860]  they're hiring so many nurses are going to run everything they always do in socialist countries
[02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:54.020]  and they'll just implement here's your pills here's your whatever you aren't going to be seeing doctors
[02:16:54.020 --> 02:17:01.540]  it just hey enjoy yourselves you want it you got it they'll still be specialty hospitals and things
[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:09.140]  for the elite for a while but um we're going to come back from break and go to rob and then we're
[02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:11.940]  going to go to walter and then we're going to go to justin we're going to go to ba then we're
[02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:17.540]  going to go to anthony uh we're going to go to everybody that's patiently holding uh who who
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:21.860]  want to get into all the news we've been talking about the good news since i hadn't gotten to that
[02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:29.540]  since ventura was on with us seamore herge has come out and uh pulled surprise winner and said
[02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:35.780]  that the entire bin laden rate is completely fake and quote one big lie uh and pathetic and it just
[02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:40.420]  goes on and on so there's that article in fall wars dot com prison body dot com it's also i'm
[02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:48.420]  drudge report dot com uh then we've got um some got warning to avoid west gate mall in nirobi
[02:17:48.420 --> 02:17:54.660]  kenya before bloody siege kenya's national intelligence agency warned some people not
[02:17:54.660 --> 02:18:00.020]  to visit the west gate shopping mall in nirobi before the bloody siege and warning that was
[02:18:00.020 --> 02:18:04.260]  not received by the 67 victims who lost their lives during the attack buried at the end of the
[02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:08.580]  london independent report about the incident as a revelation that the nis did warn the police and
[02:18:08.580 --> 02:18:13.620]  officials inside the president's office before the west gate siege but its warnings went unheeded
[02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:17.620]  yeah and either that means there was a false flag or it means they knew but were ordered
[02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:23.700]  to basically stand down when you see that time and time again uh continuing individual officials
[02:18:23.700 --> 02:18:28.900]  within the nis also told their family members to avoid the west gate mall uh on saturday because
[02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:34.100]  it would be the target of an attack yeah rob do's brother-in-law in the official army

[02:33:32.580 --> 02:33:38.340]  how do you stop the special interests that operate as basically global mafias
[02:33:39.460 --> 02:33:44.820]  well not basically they are they're above the classical mafia you become aware of them and
[02:33:44.820 --> 02:33:51.300]  their criminality you become distrustful of government and big institutions again
[02:33:51.300 --> 02:33:56.340]  you become fiercely independent and you don't roll over to whatever directives or edicts they
[02:33:56.340 --> 02:34:03.540]  shove in your face and you then organize as citizens around basic human rights and liberties
[02:34:03.540 --> 02:34:08.260]  that are beautifully enshrined in the bill of rights declaration of independence and you enforce
[02:34:08.260 --> 02:34:15.380]  that every day in little ways and it's a constant battle will never live in a perfect world not one
[02:34:15.380 --> 02:34:24.180]  run by man but by being aggressive by being fiercely independent you create an atmosphere
[02:34:24.820 --> 02:34:30.340]  of human liberty and human exceptionalism instead of an atmosphere of gangs and cliques
[02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:36.660]  and collectivism we know that collectivism and big government creates a nightmare situation
[02:34:36.660 --> 02:34:45.700]  we know that we know it's horrible we know that it is the ruination of civilizations
[02:34:48.580 --> 02:34:54.180]  like a heroin addiction it feels good at first but leads to the road to perdition
[02:34:56.180 --> 02:34:59.860]  and it really just comes down to that a free people will not be slaves
[02:34:59.860 --> 02:35:06.100]  unaggressive people will not be slaves a liberty loving people will not be slaves and but they
[02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:12.900]  gave us high tech tv brainwashing disinformation we use more drugs than any other country per
[02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:18.980]  capita more alcohol more entertainment more everything we are just a corrupt nation just
[02:35:18.980 --> 02:35:23.620]  like in the bible when israel would become moral and upright they would become incredibly successful
[02:35:23.620 --> 02:35:28.340]  and dominant then they would become decadent and corrupt with their dominance and they would decline
[02:35:28.340 --> 02:35:34.180]  collapse and become conquered and it's the same history in every other part of the world
[02:35:34.180 --> 02:35:40.020]  it's just that the jews were good at writing and keeping everything written down so we have a very
[02:35:40.020 --> 02:35:44.740]  detailed story of what happened to them but now with archaeology and the rosetta stone and the
[02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:49.220]  fact that they've been able to translate all the other hieroglyphs and languages it's the same story
[02:35:49.220 --> 02:35:56.420]  over and over and over and over and over and over again trailblazers men and women of strength
[02:35:56.420 --> 02:36:03.060]  and honor build civilizations and then their great grandkids become decadent slobs psychopaths take
[02:36:03.060 --> 02:36:08.980]  over the the culture becomes about manipulating people against each other not about building
[02:36:08.980 --> 02:36:14.500]  a better society and then things collapse and that's where we're going right now and the elite
[02:36:14.500 --> 02:36:18.980]  knows that writes books about it but says technocracy and the robots will keep their system
[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:24.660]  from collapsing and the public scum so they'll just you know soft kill us ahead of the real kill
[02:36:25.620 --> 02:36:30.180]  the silent weapons for quiet wars and we're living in a science fiction movie and all you've
[02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:35.860]  got to do is realize how crazy things are and it's all over we can turn it around folks
[02:36:37.300 --> 02:36:45.140]  but not if you won't admit how much trouble we're in but i see from government at every corner
[02:36:45.140 --> 02:36:50.100]  corporate systems you name it more more people realize their kids are in danger and that bowing
[02:36:50.100 --> 02:36:55.220]  down to this giving in is what's gotten us to this point and the human spirit is reignited it
[02:36:55.220 --> 02:37:00.660]  doesn't mean we're winning but we're in the fight folks and the last round we've been winning the last
[02:37:00.660 --> 02:37:07.860]  round and it's time to decide in this fight that you're not going to get knocked out you're committed
[02:37:07.860 --> 02:37:12.820]  it's life and death you're going to flip the switch and you're going to go in there and defend
[02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:18.420]  humanity and i'm telling you ladies and gentlemen it's flipping a switch in sports in business in
[02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:25.940]  life with god letting god into your heart in life it's time to flip the switch yeah i need you to
[02:37:25.940 --> 02:37:29.220]  make that decision to flip the switch and really get aggressive about this stuff
[02:37:31.780 --> 02:37:36.180]  we can turn things around but you're going to have to flip the switch you're going to have to be a
[02:37:36.180 --> 02:37:40.580]  leader in your area you're going to have to get aggressive you're going to have to go with what you
[02:37:40.580 --> 02:37:46.260]  can prove not with what people say you're going to have to really get out there and not have a hope
[02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:51.940]  and a dream of what the system says but realize it is predatory at its heart at the center of the
[02:37:51.940 --> 02:37:58.340]  web it is liquid death and it's the enemy and nothing they say can you listen or buy it just
[02:37:58.340 --> 02:38:05.780]  like jesse ventura said i agree with him i mean it has to come to that point of even when you're
[02:38:05.780 --> 02:38:10.020]  doing something good for me i know there's a bad reason at the end of it and i don't want to be
[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:16.020]  associated with you i'm not breaking bread with you i'm not being nice to you i'm not giving you
[02:38:16.020 --> 02:38:24.340]  aid and comforts suker sucker i'm not giving you any companionship nothing nothing all you get from
[02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:30.500]  me is resistance and that's a spirit ladies and gentlemen but don't spend all your time just hating
[02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:34.900]  the new world order it's a spirit of we got to protect the people let's go to your calls i need
[02:38:34.900 --> 02:38:40.660]  to shut up ba in north carolina you're on the air welcome hey can you hear me alex yes sir
[02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:46.660]  okay very good long-time listener about third-time caller you'll find this story interesting i was
[02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:52.100]  i am a small business owner i'm actually in the insurance industry i won't say which company
[02:38:52.100 --> 02:38:58.100]  obviously but it's big um we do broker health insurance and i was in a conference call yesterday
[02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:05.060]  on the unaffordable care i'm sorry affordable care act um and how it was going to impact
[02:39:05.060 --> 02:39:11.940]  business owners as well as the public and it was interesting we had a rep on from one of the largest
[02:39:11.940 --> 02:39:17.860]  health insurance companies in the country and he was saying about how it would be a service for us
[02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:24.820]  to go ahead and quote people now because whatever rate we sell them now we can lock in for a year
[02:39:24.820 --> 02:39:31.700]  whereas if they buy the same product january 1st it's going to be a ton more they're coming from
[02:39:31.700 --> 02:39:35.380]  the health insurance company i mean this guy's been there for 12 years well let me just stop you
[02:39:35.380 --> 02:39:38.900]  briefly because this is a fact they admit it's going to probably double it the next year it's
[02:39:38.900 --> 02:39:44.980]  already gone up just beforehand as you know have you seen the movie the Incredibles no i haven't i
[02:39:44.980 --> 02:39:50.580]  don't watch a lot of tv i saw with avatar about what five six years ago sure i mean my point is
[02:39:50.580 --> 02:39:55.380]  most listeners have so it's a way to inform them it's a very good children's movie i liked it most
[02:39:55.380 --> 02:40:00.180]  the stuff's a bunch of bills but the reason i raise it is the hero in it is really an insurance
[02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:06.020]  salesman by day or he's a retired superhero and he's there secretly telling little old ladies
[02:40:06.020 --> 02:40:10.100]  how to actually get their health care with the insurance company and i actually know that there
[02:40:10.100 --> 02:40:14.740]  are good people in the system who do want to sell a good product and who do want to be fair
[02:40:14.740 --> 02:40:19.220]  and who do want to help people and that's why the system wants to get rid of the competition
[02:40:19.220 --> 02:40:25.060]  calling it competition so i use that as the analogy of when we criticize the insurance companies
[02:40:25.060 --> 02:40:31.140]  we're criticizing who runs them what it's turning into not the good people inside and in that what's
[02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:37.300]  in that movie is art imitating life there are so many good people in the system that are trying to
[02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:42.020]  make it work for the people and that's what obama care does is take away your capability to do that
[02:40:42.020 --> 02:40:45.300]  but i'm going to shut up you've been holding forever go ahead and make your point oh yeah
[02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:50.740]  that's fine no getting back to the story though we know i had 30 approximately 30 of my colleagues
[02:40:50.740 --> 02:40:56.180]  on the conference call with with this rep and after he kind of explained that you know rates
[02:40:56.180 --> 02:41:00.980]  are going up next year you know they've already gone up 60 i believe in the past two years yes
[02:41:00.980 --> 02:41:04.660]  and i've seen that because i mean i've been in i've been insurance for a few years now
[02:41:04.660 --> 02:41:09.060]  and um this we had one lady in particular come on now this is a business owner like myself
[02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:14.900]  educated lady and she basically said well from the information that i've gotten in the state
[02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:19.700]  senators that i've talked to in the congressmen and all this it seems like it's exactly the
[02:41:19.700 --> 02:41:24.820]  opposite of what you're telling me and and and i almost fell out of my chair because i mean this
[02:41:24.820 --> 02:41:30.820]  is like the first time she had considered that maybe obama care wasn't going to help people
[02:41:30.820 --> 02:41:37.380]  and she was serious and she said so it almost seems to me like it's been a lie and and and this guy
[02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:42.500]  on the phone a rep he literally said well i don't want to get political on this call this is in the
[02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:48.020]  nature of it but but it it is a lie and my whole office just about fell out laughing but i mean
[02:41:48.020 --> 02:41:52.660]  you've really i mean that that's that's how much disinformation is out there whenever you've got
[02:41:52.660 --> 02:41:58.900]  people in the industry still thinking it's a good thing and we're what uh three days from
[02:41:58.900 --> 02:42:04.100]  october 1st the rollout first part of the rollout that's right and you're right uh the numbers are
[02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:10.020]  between 55 and 70 percent depending on whose numbers you look at ap Reuters uh Forbes it's
[02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:16.260]  it's 55 65 70 percent depending on what number you look at increase but my dad's in healthcare
[02:42:16.260 --> 02:42:22.100]  management we're talking 22 offices that he personally manages uh he's got these big healthcare
[02:42:22.100 --> 02:42:28.180]  things outside dentistry that want to hire him uh he's actually a consultant and he he is shaken
[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:33.380]  by it because he knows it's written by big insurance to shut down more clinics to then bankrupt
[02:42:33.380 --> 02:42:38.980]  everything and nationalize it with select groups above it to knock out all the smaller insurance
[02:42:38.980 --> 02:42:44.820]  sales people i mean it's a corporate consolidation screw job and that's why i started hyperventilating
[02:42:44.820 --> 02:42:51.060]  about 30 minutes ago on air because because it's almost like a panic attack on air mixed with sick
[02:42:51.060 --> 02:42:59.460]  laughter because it's so disgusting that the public hears these lies and the lies are so big
[02:42:59.460 --> 02:43:04.900]  that there's no way that they could be lying to me and then even as the premiums go up and even as
[02:43:04.900 --> 02:43:10.900]  the deductibles go up yes people on welfare now will get free health care they always got free
[02:43:10.900 --> 02:43:15.300]  health care on medicare and medicare hospitals aren't supposed to turn you away it's charity care
[02:43:15.300 --> 02:43:19.780]  and people calling to go there's no charity care you're a liar when i know all about it
[02:43:19.780 --> 02:43:27.060]  i've worked in health care in college and it's so frustrating to sit there and know i'm right
[02:43:28.020 --> 02:43:32.100]  and to have these ignorant people telling me i'm a liar when all i'm trying to do is help them
[02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:37.540]  and i don't even have a dog in this fight and then i think to myself what are they thinking when
[02:43:37.540 --> 02:43:41.940]  this goes in how are they thinking they're going to get away with it and then i realize
[02:43:41.940 --> 02:43:46.660]  they're planning to stage something giant so horrible that we're going to be under martial law
[02:43:46.660 --> 02:43:50.820]  and it won't matter if they've already nationalized health care the only way they're going to get away
[02:43:50.820 --> 02:43:56.660]  with this is like some giant war scenario or bio weapons scenario because let me tell you i've
[02:43:56.660 --> 02:44:03.060]  looked at this this will like mitch mcconnell says in collectivist in socialism for 20 years
[02:44:03.060 --> 02:44:09.860]  it will discredit it forever okay it will absolutely destroy it but they don't care
[02:44:09.860 --> 02:44:14.500]  they're going forward and the elite are smart they wouldn't be doing this unless they thought
[02:44:14.500 --> 02:44:19.780]  they've got a plan let me ask you this ba in north carolina what do you think about what i'm saying
[02:44:20.820 --> 02:44:25.540]  well i think i think you're right on on a lot of it and obviously you know you've been talking about
[02:44:25.540 --> 02:44:29.620]  how how the premiums are going to go up for a while and as far as the event that they may or may
[02:44:29.620 --> 02:44:33.940]  not stage i mean it's certainly in the cards and i mean it's not it won't won't be the first time
[02:44:33.940 --> 02:44:37.940]  they've done it it won't the question is here's the question we don't know what event it's going
[02:44:37.940 --> 02:44:42.980]  to be my point is my question to you is well how do they think they're going to get away with this
[02:44:44.740 --> 02:44:51.220]  i don't think they really care um you know if the if the move is to siphon off money
[02:44:51.860 --> 02:44:57.620]  from the public and to ultimately uh you know wreck the economy then then everything's going
[02:44:57.620 --> 02:45:02.260]  to plan and then actually convincing people that you're doing it for them and that you love them
[02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:07.060]  and everything like that you know and i and i wanted to set a little bit of light on the actual
[02:45:07.620 --> 02:45:12.820]  on what's actually going to happen because i was there is there is information available if you go
[02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:22.660]  to healthcare dot gov and it rolls out obviously january first but there is subs there are subsidies
[02:45:22.660 --> 02:45:27.940]  for people actually up to four times that make up the four times what is considered the poverty
[02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:33.540]  level but if you even if you even go put your information in there and you see what the subsidy
[02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:39.620]  is you know in our rep we can discuss this you know you could still be having a family or or an
[02:45:39.620 --> 02:45:44.740]  individual paying a thousand dollars a month and so what's going to happen come january first is
[02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:48.980]  going to be a lot of interest there's going to be a lot of people that want quotes that weren't able
[02:45:48.980 --> 02:45:52.980]  to obtain coverage due to pretty different conditions or what have you you know they're
[02:45:52.980 --> 02:45:56.740]  going to show up with you know on dialysis or whatever they make case may be and they're
[02:45:56.740 --> 02:46:01.940]  going to get a quote on it but if they make if you make money if you make any kind of a living
[02:46:02.580 --> 02:46:08.500]  it's going to be uh unaffordable not affordable um because no no no exactly it's meant to bankrupt
[02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:12.740]  the system and make it unaffordable for everybody that's already paying the highest price in the
[02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:17.700]  world in the graphs for healthcare that's it exactly god bless you and i appreciate your
[02:46:17.700 --> 02:46:24.340]  inside points look here's the issue it's also a bait and switch there's 10 000 pages of amendments
[02:46:24.340 --> 02:46:28.740]  on a 3000 page bill there are hundreds of nightmares in there that have been discovered
[02:46:29.300 --> 02:46:32.980]  and then they won't say how they're going to implement them they won't say what the interpretation
[02:46:32.980 --> 02:46:39.060]  is it's just like the un treaty is open ended it's like everything they do is just a power grab it
[02:46:39.060 --> 02:46:44.180]  just it federalizes things it allows the government to pick winners and losers the government to give
[02:46:44.180 --> 02:46:50.420]  exemptions it's meant to shut down small business shut down competition the big guys are all exempt
[02:46:50.420 --> 02:46:59.540]  and yes there will be some free goodies to the illegal aliens and uh people on welfare notice
[02:46:59.540 --> 02:47:03.620]  the unions are flipping out because they're noticing their premiums are going up and their
[02:47:03.620 --> 02:47:08.580]  insurance uh their their deductibles going up and that's why this is this has gone from being
[02:47:08.580 --> 02:47:13.780]  unpopular to super unpopular and the storm hadn't even hit yet see what i'm saying the
[02:47:13.780 --> 02:47:17.700]  storm hasn't hit yet and i don't even know what to say at this point it's so bad
[02:47:20.500 --> 02:47:26.820]  but again it's designed to get government control over what the doctors can do because
[02:47:26.820 --> 02:47:30.580]  when it increases the prices again they're going to say we got to have affordability
[02:47:30.580 --> 02:47:35.220]  so they're going to come in and ration the care and stuff they've done this in other country so
[02:47:35.220 --> 02:47:40.900]  it looks confusing to people it's like shoving a shoving a horse in a meat grinder you're like
[02:47:40.900 --> 02:47:46.100]  man that's really gross but on the other end comes out ground meat and we know it comes out the other
[02:47:46.100 --> 02:47:53.300]  end centralized corrupt crony systems and they've got this eugenics program going into place
[02:47:54.580 --> 02:47:59.140]  with everybody with all the deficiencies and the problems and the fluoride and the glands all
[02:47:59.140 --> 02:48:04.020]  screwed up to where they know everybody's going to start having even more problems as they carry
[02:48:04.020 --> 02:48:08.820]  out the eugenics and so they've got to get it where we can't get real health care and we and we
[02:48:08.820 --> 02:48:14.100]  get nationalized health care i mean that's the program here by the way speaking of health care
[02:48:14.100 --> 02:48:19.380]  we're going to come back and take more calls survival shield i've done massive research
[02:48:20.340 --> 02:48:26.660]  with medical doctors nutritionists you name it and nason iodine is the biggest unknown
[02:48:28.740 --> 02:48:35.620]  info out there it is one of the biggest secrets that the public is not aware of and we have double
[02:48:35.620 --> 02:48:43.380]  strength nation iodine at half the price of the leading competitors we went to the best lab fda
[02:48:43.380 --> 02:48:49.620]  accredited inspected all that uh with doctor group had them develop it put up all the money to get
[02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:55.140]  it and it's hard to get nason iodine it's raw iodine it's pure iodine it's not the chemical
[02:48:55.140 --> 02:49:00.740]  garbage at the store or the pills or all that we have a video breaking it down up at info wars
[02:49:00.740 --> 02:49:06.260]  life.com it's the first product of many we're going to be rolling out it's simply amazing and you
[02:49:06.260 --> 02:49:11.700]  can find out all the details at info wars life.com here's the other news i ordered a lot of this
[02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:18.980]  and we are half sold out of it in one day and i thought this would be a month you know supply
[02:49:18.980 --> 02:49:23.860]  of it so we're we're having more manufactured right now but then when that's manufactured
[02:49:23.860 --> 02:49:29.940]  they don't even know when the next time is they can get a hold of nason iodine okay i mean there's
[02:49:29.940 --> 02:49:34.580]  a reason it's 60 bucks a bottle we've got it for 30 the bottle and it's double strength so
[02:49:35.540 --> 02:49:40.180]  we're bringing you a good deal here it helps fund the radio show as well it's great for cuts you
[02:49:40.180 --> 02:49:45.140]  name it but what's really good for is your thyroid inside your body your whole metabolism this is what
[02:49:45.140 --> 02:49:49.220]  this is what your thyroid needs versus the fluoride they put in the water that it doesn't
[02:49:49.220 --> 02:49:54.740]  this is a supercharger across the board according to doctor group and so many others uh dr brownstein
[02:49:54.740 --> 02:50:00.980]  you name it and i've been doing it for a couple months my wife has and it is it is dynamic what
[02:50:00.980 --> 02:50:05.300]  it's done for me so you can get it up to five packs people are asking for more than five packs and
[02:50:05.300 --> 02:50:09.220]  get discounts they were going to add a 10 pack on there but i'll go talk to welden and shipping
[02:50:09.220 --> 02:50:15.540]  back there the issue is is that this will probably be sold out by sunday in fact it might be sold out
[02:50:15.540 --> 02:50:19.940]  tomorrow uh if this continues and then it'll be back ordered a couple weeks and then when that's
[02:50:19.940 --> 02:50:24.900]  gone it might be two three months so uh victims of our own success but this couldn't come at a
[02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:28.980]  better time is a blessing for us to promote a great product like this that everybody needs

[02:54:43.060 --> 02:54:48.020]  say well that guy's not really a christian you know why are you talking to him he wasn't even a
[02:54:48.020 --> 02:54:55.540]  spiritualist three or four years ago and he's listening to the show and that's good so he's
[02:54:55.540 --> 02:55:04.180]  i believe on the path through waking up and so i got invited out there but i didn't want to bug
[02:55:04.180 --> 02:55:09.620]  him and then a tweet came in private tweet hey are you gonna come and then i went to get tickets
[02:55:09.620 --> 02:55:13.620]  and it was sold out so i just ignored it and he said another tweet to me and said hey are you
[02:55:13.620 --> 02:55:20.020]  gonna come and i said uh yeah okay and then i was just kind of sneak and not go because i don't
[02:55:20.020 --> 02:55:26.500]  want to bug people i knew would you know turn into a circus and then we get a phone call
[02:55:27.140 --> 02:55:32.020]  by his main assistant saying hey where are you sitting we've got you you know front row seats and
[02:55:32.660 --> 02:55:36.180]  you know we've got you a guest list who you want to put on it so we send them an email back saying
[02:55:36.180 --> 02:55:43.860]  okay put three people on it i'll bring a couple camera guys but then i was halfway not gonna go
[02:55:43.860 --> 02:55:47.460]  because i don't want to deal with the security and then i go okay they sent me another message
[02:55:47.460 --> 02:55:53.140]  like where are you right before it started i guess russell really is a fan of this term like he said
[02:55:53.780 --> 02:55:58.820]  so i get in the car at 730 drive down there a show starts at like eight they've closed the doors but
[02:55:58.820 --> 02:56:05.540]  i'll walk up and the guy opens the door and goes hello alex one of the people that works in the
[02:56:05.540 --> 02:56:09.060]  paramount theater beautiful old theater that i've been going to since i was a kid when i come down
[02:56:09.060 --> 02:56:12.820]  here in the summer uh you my mom would take me there so i'm from Dallas but we'd come down here

[02:56:24.020 --> 02:56:29.060]  just because it ties into so many things and i'm not telling this is a celebrity story it's a psychology
[02:56:29.060 --> 02:56:33.700]  story so we get there the doors are closed but they have a policy of letting you in even though
[02:56:33.700 --> 02:56:37.780]  they close it doesn't matter and i try to open it it's not open the guy opens goes hey what do you
[02:56:37.780 --> 02:56:42.660]  want alex god knew who i was i see the bartender going hey alex come here i gotta drink for you

[02:57:01.860 --> 02:57:07.620]  anyone around it who wants that power it's like their reflected glory so the door opens again and i

[03:00:26.500 --> 03:00:31.460]  told you the end of it and why i'm even telling it it was just like when i went to see mega death
[03:00:31.460 --> 03:00:36.340]  and was like backstage and it's like i'm just going to see my friends and i like their music
[03:00:36.340 --> 03:00:42.580]  and it's not their security it's it's the whoever the event is they're even mean to the people that
[03:00:42.580 --> 03:00:48.820]  are the stars basically uh because when russell brand sent back you know his head of his tour
[03:00:49.460 --> 03:00:53.540]  and it's like you know this is alex jones he's on our list they didn't want to be proven wrong
[03:00:53.540 --> 03:00:57.300]  and i guess they didn't like me or something and we're like we got a lady here claiming and then
[03:00:57.300 --> 03:01:01.220]  even after that they're like we don't we don't know if you're going to be allowed back and then
[03:01:01.220 --> 03:01:06.260]  well finally when i was i'd be messed with by each usher just trying to get backstage and then when
[03:01:06.260 --> 03:01:10.740]  i got there the union people some of them were listeners shaking my hand but the head guy was
[03:01:10.740 --> 03:01:15.540]  like shaved head and a beard comes over and he goes you know long beard he goes he goes all right
[03:01:15.540 --> 03:01:19.780]  he's really busy he's got just a few minutes for you and then i asked them they go no we didn't tell
[03:01:19.780 --> 03:01:25.780]  that guy that russell asked you to come i mean it was just like the religion of messing with me
[03:01:26.820 --> 03:01:31.940]  and the religion of i want to be part of it and and and they're they're gatekeeping and
[03:01:31.940 --> 03:01:39.540]  that's their power and it's just like the people like this are ruining live events they're ruining
[03:01:39.540 --> 03:01:44.900]  special events they are i love the security at the w i'll go see stuff at the w because they
[03:01:44.900 --> 03:01:50.580]  don't mess with me and hen peck me and and i can just pull up in the loading bay to go behind the
[03:01:50.580 --> 03:01:55.380]  thing to interview somebody where it's joe rogan or mega death or whoever it is see i said i'd tell
[03:01:55.380 --> 03:01:58.340]  the story after the break and i'm already telling the story right now it's just unbelievable
[03:01:59.540 --> 03:02:05.620]  and the crazy part was the people messing with me knew who i was knew that they wanted to talk to me
[03:02:05.620 --> 03:02:12.340]  and tried everything they could to stop it and then acted like they hadn't done that once they
[03:02:12.340 --> 03:02:20.500]  all got defeated and we're sitting there glaring at me angry that i had gotten in there past all
[03:02:20.500 --> 03:02:26.500]  their baloney i mean i want to empower people it's like zoning bureaucrats under agenda 21
[03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:30.900]  they admit they want to wreck small businesses they want to wreck little guys we have a story coming
[03:02:30.900 --> 03:02:35.380]  out next week on that here in austin they want to hurt the independence i'll finish the russell

[03:02:38.740 --> 03:02:45.460]  long you won't be interrupted walter and everybody else is holding but and then here's russell brand
[03:02:45.460 --> 03:02:51.540]  in closing who's all about celebrities a joke they're manipulating us through art types all
[03:02:51.540 --> 03:02:56.100]  this corporate stuff he's awakening he's a listener my show but he's awakened through a lot of other
[03:02:56.100 --> 03:03:03.220]  stuff and here he is making fun of himself in the interview and his outfit and and narcissism
[03:03:03.220 --> 03:03:08.100]  and everything he's using narcissism in the public to try to wake him up but still the platform he's
[03:03:08.100 --> 03:03:13.140]  in is narcissism with all of these women i don't think i've seen so many beautiful women uh that
[03:03:13.140 --> 03:03:17.300]  guy is popular with the ladies just throwing themselves at all these katie perry lookalikes
[03:03:17.300 --> 03:03:24.980]  we were noticing that we're there i mean it was wild it was wild and uh and then i'm just there
[03:03:24.980 --> 03:03:30.020]  looking at the whole thing of course the cops to there were like senior cops they have for security
[03:03:30.020 --> 03:03:36.260]  there uh they were really smart nice guys listeners uh friends with the person that runs it that i'm
[03:03:36.260 --> 03:03:40.740]  friends with so i'm not even knocking the paramount by the way it's a beautiful nice theater has a lot
[03:03:40.740 --> 03:03:44.580]  of old movies they show there that you won't see anywhere else for a good theater experience i like
[03:03:44.580 --> 03:03:50.020]  it but i'll be honest with you i take my kids probably once a year to see old movies there maybe
[03:03:50.020 --> 03:03:56.500]  twice a year i'm almost you know want like a card from the management to go to like hold it up when
[03:03:56.500 --> 03:04:02.740]  the when they come it's it's alex jones he's a celebrity let's mess with him see that's the thing
[03:04:02.740 --> 03:04:08.020]  people mess with celebrities everybody thinks they want to be a celebrity no you don't want to be
[03:04:08.020 --> 03:04:12.260]  a celebrity people want to make stuff up about you they want to get close to you to make stuff up
[03:04:12.260 --> 03:04:17.220]  about you or if they don't if they're not into you or whatever they want to show you that you're
[03:04:17.220 --> 03:04:22.420]  nobody in fact one guy's like just because you're a radio host and doesn't mean you get to do whatever
[03:04:22.420 --> 03:04:28.180]  you want around here this is after i was completely gentlemanly and treated like total crap over i mean
[03:04:28.180 --> 03:04:36.740]  it was a joke level i went with shane steiner and his wife to the whole mega death thing and um
[03:04:39.300 --> 03:04:43.460]  and he was saying it was like a joke how he got messed with just over and over again
[03:04:43.460 --> 03:04:48.500]  every level by the security pecking pecking pecking pecking pecking because that's their
[03:04:48.500 --> 03:04:53.300]  religion and i'm telling you within that is the spirit of the new world order that's what they
[03:04:53.300 --> 03:04:58.740]  want to do they want to dominate and control and a little lesser minions are at minimum wage

[03:08:18.020 --> 03:08:24.740]  russell brand story to be pissy as they would say or complaining it's the it's the societal thing
[03:08:24.740 --> 03:08:30.100]  that one of our crew members does electrical work you know crew work for big bands one of our
[03:08:30.100 --> 03:08:35.220]  engineers and he said no i know the group that runs the security not the actual staff of the
[03:08:35.220 --> 03:08:38.820]  paramount and he goes they are the worst in the city because they would have one person come up
[03:08:38.820 --> 03:08:42.740]  get in our face and then we'd walk to the next level and another one would do it just for fun
[03:08:42.740 --> 03:08:47.140]  it's kind of like with the open carry thing down by the capital with the legal black powder guns
[03:08:47.140 --> 03:08:54.980]  one cop comes up harasses you the next cop comes up and harasses you it's a tactic and and and
[03:08:54.980 --> 03:08:59.140]  chris was saying that he's been around those guys when they admit look i get eight dollars an hour
[03:08:59.140 --> 03:09:05.060]  i have this job so i can mess with people and have power they actually say that ladies and gentlemen
[03:09:06.100 --> 03:09:09.860]  and i'm just saying that's the spirit we're dealing with and now we're going to have that spirit
[03:09:09.860 --> 03:09:15.060]  fully over our health care with our health records and everything being used and national
[03:09:15.060 --> 03:09:20.100]  health care being denied to people you know the IRS is harassing the tea party and gun owners and
[03:09:20.100 --> 03:09:26.900]  religious groups and trying to make churches pay for abortions do you think they're going to use
[03:09:26.900 --> 03:09:32.100]  national health care to harass people well they already are folks they already are in the implementation
[03:09:32.100 --> 03:09:38.900]  of it it's not a question it's already going on and that's what i hate about tyranny is it just
[03:09:38.900 --> 03:09:47.300]  lets all these nobodies who who've never had real power and don't know what a responsibility it is
[03:09:47.300 --> 03:09:54.180]  messing with people just to mess with you even when russell brand said yeah i called him here

[03:10:10.100 --> 03:10:16.260]  me because i'm successful that's what it is and they've got that job so they can mess with me all
[03:10:16.260 --> 03:10:21.540]  day and it's the same thing with bureaucrats same thing with bad cops the two cops that were there
[03:10:21.540 --> 03:10:26.420]  were laughing at them the whole time because they were out front when it started it took two hours
[03:10:27.220 --> 03:10:32.500]  and we went eight for an hour but it was a two hour period two hours of a gauntlet of people
[03:10:32.500 --> 03:10:41.860]  messing with us and literally when but it all it like made it triumphant when we finally got the
[03:10:41.860 --> 03:10:45.060]  interview which was no big deal i mean i'm happy to get the interview we're gonna air it next week
[03:10:45.060 --> 03:10:50.980]  and it was pretty powerful by the way uh the video interview but it's just i mean i don't think i can

[03:10:55.220 --> 03:10:59.220]  down to meet them i don't think i can be around it it's just like i don't want to be messed with
[03:10:59.220 --> 03:11:05.220]  by bureaucrats i mean i just but in a way i need to go to more of these and i guess challenge or

[03:11:56.340 --> 03:12:02.420]  blow against the global let's go ahead well we knew that benazir budo in a david frost interview
[03:12:02.420 --> 03:12:08.660]  uh quite a few years i guess was like 2006 or 2007 said that bin laden had been assassinated
[03:12:08.660 --> 03:12:13.780]  by one of his own people that's number one number two you've had dr. steve pochennecone
[03:12:13.780 --> 03:12:20.340]  he said that the man was totally sick and and uh with marfan syndrome that's another point
[03:12:20.340 --> 03:12:28.500]  you know he was in dubai american-owned hospitals barely alive in 2001 that's the cbs news exactly
[03:12:28.500 --> 03:12:35.940]  and then you've got mr. obama coming out on may first which is may day in communist russia
[03:12:35.940 --> 03:12:41.620]  and of the anniversary of the birth of the illuminati as well back in 1777 i was about to say it
[03:12:41.620 --> 03:12:48.340]  predates russia it's actually illuminati day right announcing that the minds of osama bin laden
[03:12:48.340 --> 03:12:54.100]  in a false operation that we obviously see very clearly on that that situation room
[03:12:54.100 --> 03:12:57.940]  photographs that they were sure sure how big is it though that it's all collapsing i mean
[03:12:57.940 --> 03:13:04.500]  do people realize the history we're living in the middle of right now well i hopefully the smart
[03:13:04.500 --> 03:13:09.940]  listeners that pay attention to your show and other other shows like it are realizing that it's
[03:13:09.940 --> 03:13:15.780]  all been just a big scam and a big sham the whole time uh it's going to take a lot more to get the
[03:13:15.780 --> 03:13:20.660]  rest of the world awake and i feel sorry for those that don't want to wake up because they are going
[03:13:20.660 --> 03:13:26.260]  to fall victim to a really serious type of tyranny that's going to crush them in their in their bed

[03:14:40.900 --> 03:14:46.660]  call to tell you a quick story and every time i call it seems like it's a story about intimidation
[03:14:47.220 --> 03:14:52.740]  uh what i've been doing recently um as a book i i still confront politicians but i've been
[03:14:52.740 --> 03:15:00.900]  confronting a lot of mainstream media journalists and reporters well yesterday i was at a local
[03:15:00.900 --> 03:15:09.060]  store and a cameraman from a local mainstream media outlet recognized me and he literally
[03:15:09.060 --> 03:15:15.620]  attacked me uh in the store he threatened my life i was able to get my phone out real quick
[03:15:15.620 --> 03:15:21.300]  and i recorded it so i put the video up now and you could see him he is completely say the name of
[03:15:21.300 --> 03:15:27.460]  the video say the name of the video uh it says crazy it's titled crazy cameraman attacks
[03:15:27.460 --> 03:15:35.540]  journalist um and i posted it on uh your info wars uh facebook page but i mean he's completely i
[03:15:35.540 --> 03:15:44.100]  rate and he he says i'm gonna bring down your radio show okay so this is a okay so he knows you
[03:15:44.100 --> 03:15:49.140]  you have a local radio show okay well let me stop you real quick uh because you were we are changed
[03:15:49.140 --> 03:15:54.500]  right you've called before yeah yeah right okay anthony okay i remember a few months ago this happened
[03:15:55.300 --> 03:15:59.300]  it's funny you mentioned cameraman because a lot of them are real nice i have been attacked by
[03:15:59.300 --> 03:16:06.980]  mainstream media cameraman let's not exaggerate more than 10 times uh twice when i was covering
[03:16:06.980 --> 03:16:12.740]  bush in the whole election fight in 2000 i would come down in bullhorn at the governor's mansion
[03:16:12.740 --> 03:16:18.820]  and the cops knew i had a first amendment i had an abc news guy run over and hit me with both his
[03:16:18.820 --> 03:16:27.140]  hands open like a girl in the neck uh and and uh come after me uh and then i had to have another
[03:16:27.140 --> 03:16:31.780]  time but yeah they think they're allowed to assault you because they're in the mainstream media and i
[03:16:31.780 --> 03:16:36.980]  had a uh well it's like michael moore's bodyguards he comes out of a restaurant i see him walking
[03:16:36.980 --> 03:16:40.900]  down the street i was they said we're taking you to be able to interview michael moore there was
[03:16:40.900 --> 03:16:44.580]  a guy that worked for cable vision new his people we get there and my whole board goes no i'm not
[03:16:44.580 --> 03:16:48.980]  going to talk to him now so he ducks in this restaurant so i'll wait 30 minutes i get some
[03:16:48.980 --> 03:16:55.060]  food the restaurant next door his security guards come out six of them there's video of this in my
[03:16:55.060 --> 03:16:59.620]  film marshal law and i'm like going hey michael you know why do you have bodyguards but we can't
[03:16:59.620 --> 03:17:04.820]  have guns and the guy likes her it's elbowing me so i i hit him back but the point is they think
[03:17:04.820 --> 03:17:09.940]  they're allowed to hit you because they're with a celebrity and they it's the opposite so so
[03:17:09.940 --> 03:17:14.420]  anything will look into that god bless you thanks for the call uh let's go ahead and go to rush in
[03:17:14.420 --> 03:17:20.340]  texas rush you're on the air welcome thanks house for taking my call let's look at a few points the
[03:17:20.340 --> 03:17:26.980]  first thing is the i i see that um the uh the church is uh have no idea what's going on with them
[03:17:26.980 --> 03:17:32.500]  you know during in 1933 uh adopt that we went to the catholic church and it said uh you know if
[03:17:32.500 --> 03:17:37.380]  you don't stop talking politics against our nazi party we're going to initiate assassination
[03:17:37.380 --> 03:17:43.700]  squads against your priests so in 1933 uh the catholic church signed a concordant which said
[03:17:43.700 --> 03:17:49.140]  they would not speak against the politics of the of the nazi party we see the same scenario
[03:17:49.140 --> 03:17:55.220]  in the 501c 3 tax yeah that's the clergy response teams on record most big preachers are on the
[03:17:55.220 --> 03:18:01.540]  federal payroll and are given faith-based money and are now government agents it's it's pure evil
[03:18:02.340 --> 03:18:08.740]  and it's absolutely would reduce the church to a religious status the christianity is not a religion
[03:18:08.740 --> 03:18:13.300]  it is an absolute personal sir it's worse it's worse than the church being reduced to religion
[03:18:13.300 --> 03:18:18.260]  and not spiritual it's reduced the churches across the board even if it's a buddhist temple they're
[03:18:18.260 --> 03:18:24.980]  part of this stuff now or a Sikh temple or catholic or protestant or orthodox they are coming in
[03:18:25.540 --> 03:18:31.140]  saying work with us spy on people here's money they're being turned into secret agents who have
[03:18:31.140 --> 03:18:38.020]  betrayed their sacred oath to to try to wake people up spiritually so it is the essence of
[03:18:38.020 --> 03:18:44.740]  authoritarianism another connection to the fascist ideology that we're seeing uh grow uh the church
[03:18:44.740 --> 03:18:50.100]  is basically handed over its birthright its birthright is its uh uh it's just sir it's no
[03:18:50.100 --> 03:18:56.180]  longer a church they are now government psi op operations masquerading as churches they are
[03:18:56.820 --> 03:19:02.340]  even if the preacher himself is not evil if he consciously goes along with it he is now putting
[03:19:02.340 --> 03:19:09.300]  on the robes of the new world order and the antichrist if christianity wants to rise again it's
[03:19:09.300 --> 03:19:14.020]  going to have to throw off that seal of 501c 3 status retain its birthright which is it which is
[03:19:14.020 --> 03:19:20.180]  its ability to stand up against and speak against principalities and spirits i agree i agree i agree
[03:19:20.740 --> 03:19:25.220]  hey what do you think about all this news coming out with bin laden not being killed sigh hirsch that's
[03:19:25.220 --> 03:19:29.380]  the that's the most respected reporter out there probably total bombshell amazing integrity from
[03:19:29.380 --> 03:19:34.660]  him we already know that uh that's it you know staged event uh the swat team's coming out saying
[03:19:34.660 --> 03:19:39.300]  that was a standout order that they think it's suspicious at the naval yard just across the
[03:19:39.300 --> 03:19:45.060]  board everybody's going public the the kenya situation prior knowledge info out both our
[03:19:45.060 --> 03:19:51.140]  articles are up at drugs report dot com on that subject i mean this is getting crazy oh this is
[03:19:51.140 --> 03:19:57.140]  bombshell alice but until people return to christ in the stablister relationship with jesus christ
[03:19:57.140 --> 03:20:01.460]  he is not going to give them the power and authority to stand up against this witness and this
[03:20:01.460 --> 03:20:06.100]  and these wars and all the stuff that's going on we must return to christ and get our uh you know
[03:20:06.100 --> 03:20:13.220]  get our uh ourselves right well i agree with you but the problem is i mean a lot of nice preachers
[03:20:13.220 --> 03:20:18.500]  i go a lot of churches i go with friends i go with family and man you go a couple times you
[03:20:18.500 --> 03:20:23.140]  always get the homeland security sermon you can tell was written by the feds i'll go up and talk
[03:20:23.140 --> 03:20:30.820]  to the preacher and they'll kind of freak out uh you know the it's just very sad it's very depressing
[03:20:30.820 --> 03:20:36.260]  uh to see the new order taken over the church and when the church led us against king george
[03:20:37.300 --> 03:20:42.900]  across the board you know christian churches led the fight against king george with uh
[03:20:42.900 --> 03:20:49.780]  235 years ago and now we're the opposite and and look as thomas jefferson and george washington
[03:20:49.780 --> 03:20:55.780]  all of them said immoral people cannot be free and folks i cannot believe
[03:20:55.780 --> 03:21:03.620]  how evil stuff's getting and it's scary because if you study history people get this decadent
[03:21:03.620 --> 03:21:10.260]  katie bar the door thank you ross uh flinn in like flinn from new york you're on the air go ahead
[03:21:11.140 --> 03:21:16.660]  good afternoon alex how you doing good buddy thank you so much for taking the call um i've
[03:21:16.660 --> 03:21:22.420]  tried to call a couple times but uh not surprising is what i wanted to contact you about today i've
[03:21:22.420 --> 03:21:27.380]  been watching the currencies and uh banking industry scandals and also the crapper around the
[03:21:27.380 --> 03:21:34.260]  world and fiat currencies all doing their saying and all the manipulation one thing that's been
[03:21:34.260 --> 03:21:41.300]  percolating the background i've had my eye on is the denar the iraqi denar uh i've been watching
[03:21:41.300 --> 03:21:46.660]  the banks to if you see a bank declare a bank holiday that means that they're doing something
[03:21:46.660 --> 03:21:53.220]  really big on the inside panamoc just declared a bank holiday they shut down all services no
[03:21:53.220 --> 03:22:00.100]  transactions all the atm's are suspended until october first now and a couple of things going
[03:22:00.100 --> 03:22:07.780]  on around the world i've got a series that the oil default currency is going to collapse as
[03:22:07.780 --> 03:22:13.940]  the u.s dollar does and it's going to be transferred to the iraqi denar i think this is what's
[03:22:13.940 --> 03:22:21.780]  about to happen this is the first bank holiday i've seen since september first which i don't
[03:22:21.780 --> 03:22:29.140]  know if you heard the news out of the vatican uh in july the new pope signed a removal of immunity
[03:22:29.140 --> 03:22:35.060]  under roman curia laws which means all maritime laws around the world that dictate commerce and
[03:22:35.060 --> 03:22:42.660]  mercantilism now are dictated under the authority of the vatican they just removed all immunity so
[03:22:42.660 --> 03:22:48.900]  everybody that had immunity from any kind of criminal war crimes etc they've now just lost
[03:22:48.900 --> 03:22:55.380]  their default immunity underneath the roman curia so and then the blackout's happening
[03:22:55.380 --> 03:23:01.700]  in november first something big is is happening right now yeah gold seek is reporting bank holiday
[03:23:01.700 --> 03:23:08.660]  and panamoc announced i guess this is uh broke yesterday i wasn't aware of that and uh we're
[03:23:08.660 --> 03:23:16.580]  going to go through and look for some other sources on that i i know that uh i'm on news here i don't
[03:23:16.580 --> 03:23:23.780]  see any any sources directly from them but we'll do some more we'll do some more research into that
[03:23:25.220 --> 03:23:30.500]  we see world finance is saying let me see bank holiday let me add bank holiday to it
[03:23:30.500 --> 03:23:33.380]  it's not the kind of holiday you want folks what else do you have to say about that sir
[03:23:33.380 --> 03:23:38.900]  uh well it's primarily it i don't you know i i try not to make too many predictions and one
[03:23:38.900 --> 03:23:42.420]  not because i don't like like a fool but this is something that i've been watching for a while
[03:23:42.420 --> 03:23:47.940]  and it really looks like uh this might be the the tipping point i mean like what bernanke
[03:23:47.940 --> 03:23:54.580]  just tried to step down as the federal reserve chairman they still don't have a new guy and well
[03:23:54.580 --> 03:24:00.580]  they try to put larry summers in there but uh larry summers helped engineer the entire

[03:24:31.940 --> 03:24:38.980]  but basically they implemented it and it is more or less a prototype what i can tell you
[03:24:38.980 --> 03:24:48.820]  is that your cost will go up that is undoubtedly true um people listen to everything that alex has
[03:24:48.820 --> 03:24:55.940]  been telling you is the truth uh as well as irs involvement and what i have here in front of
[03:24:55.940 --> 03:25:01.780]  me is a little postcard i got from bank of america which you're forced to do business with uh out of
[03:25:01.780 --> 03:25:11.300]  the amore chase and it basically is questioning the expenses uh that are on my healthcare card
[03:25:11.300 --> 03:25:17.460]  debit card because they give you debit card and it question them whether or not it is an irs qualified
[03:25:17.460 --> 03:25:25.700]  expense so the irs is involved as well oh no the irs is especially the police dog of the whole deal
[03:25:25.700 --> 03:25:30.980]  i mean this is a nightmare in fact they're they're they're mainlining nsa data mining out of the
[03:25:30.980 --> 03:25:36.740]  healthcare law admitting that it's going to scoop up all the health records and financials
[03:25:36.740 --> 03:25:41.060]  they're already doing it all i mean they're using it as it's one seventh of the economy
[03:25:41.060 --> 03:25:45.620]  and through that the tentacles reach even deeper great points good to hear from you by the way
[03:25:45.620 --> 03:25:51.380]  leprecha that is a major global newspaper is confirming the bank holiday uh in panama i wasn't
[03:25:51.380 --> 03:25:58.180]  denying gold seek it's a reputable site max keiser is also reporting it's uh uh yeah leprecha is uh
[03:25:58.180 --> 03:26:02.100]  cuban but they are reporting that and that's i think it's the biggest paper in cuba isn't it
[03:26:02.100 --> 03:26:08.500]  but i've seen them do a lot of good reports uh but uh we'll continue to uh track that and and
[03:26:08.500 --> 03:26:14.740]  there is announcements in spanish on the uh national bank of panama's website too so there
[03:26:14.740 --> 03:26:19.220]  is a bank holiday going on there that that is a major scam for those that don't know they call it
[03:26:19.220 --> 03:26:24.100]  a holiday and then change the rates or take your money or there's a whole bunch of stuff they can do
[03:26:24.100 --> 03:26:30.660]  ross in louisiana you're on the air welcome alice uh i was watching fox news on tuesday morning
[03:26:30.660 --> 03:26:35.940]  america's newsroom bill hemmer's interviewing some guy about the nirobi incident and at the
[03:26:35.940 --> 03:26:42.420]  very end of the interview uh the guy i forgot his name he says and i quote they won't win
[03:26:42.420 --> 03:26:48.020]  but they can't win if they attack innocent they can win if they take down airplane but they can't
[03:26:48.020 --> 03:26:53.460]  win if they attack innocent and of course bill hammer was uh speaking over him at the time i had
[03:26:53.460 --> 03:26:58.900]  to rewind it to make sure he said what i thought he said and sure enough he said that and it made
[03:26:58.900 --> 03:27:04.260]  me think that it was just some kind of cryptic message going out over the uh national airwaves
[03:27:04.900 --> 03:27:11.140]  given the go-ahead for uh airline attacks with the stinger missiles they got from bin gazi or
[03:27:11.140 --> 03:27:16.820]  whatever they may help who was he interviewing uh who was who was uh he interviewing whenever
[03:27:17.460 --> 03:27:23.300]  the person said that i don't know the guy's name it was some us retired general or if it was some
[03:27:24.020 --> 03:27:29.220]  creep from the cia that is the type of thing because they do give orders that's actually true
[03:27:29.220 --> 03:27:36.020]  over television uh codewords and things that's actually true and they put stuff in classified
[03:27:36.020 --> 03:27:40.500]  ads all sorts of stuff that's where real spycraft goes on and i've been saying i think they're
[03:27:40.500 --> 03:27:44.100]  going to blow up a bunch of airplanes and it won't matter if the government runs al-qaeda
[03:27:44.100 --> 03:27:48.660]  everybody knows it they'll still just grandstand take our liberties it's what they do you heard
[03:27:48.660 --> 03:27:52.820]  jesse ventura i agree with him i think they're going to stay something here in the u.s very very
[03:27:52.820 --> 03:28:01.380]  soon because their stock is going down by the minute ross hey most definitely i mean i don't
[03:28:01.380 --> 03:28:06.900]  doubt it at all i just maybe if we uh we call an honor at a time they might you know think twice
[03:28:06.900 --> 03:28:13.940]  about it but it's coming it's coming real soon unfortunately i think you're right i'm sorry to

[03:28:24.820 --> 03:28:29.060]  yeah yeah i can hear me alex now now was this because one of the former spouses

[03:28:35.060 --> 03:28:40.100]  split up and it became convenient for her to change her mind on the vaccines because my son's
[03:28:40.100 --> 03:28:47.540]  unvaccinated and uh she we didn't get along and she kidnapped my boy and then the judge
[03:28:47.540 --> 03:28:52.020]  ordered her to return him to me and then she figured out if she flip flops on her vaccine
[03:28:52.900 --> 03:28:56.980]  police then she'll be yeah that's what they do you get the welfare you get your kid
