[00:00.000 --> 00:09.920]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.920 --> 00:10.920]  You want answers?
[00:10.920 --> 00:12.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.920 --> 00:31.880]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:31.880 --> 00:38.800]  Prisonplanet.com has been banned by the British government on all of their wireless networks
[00:38.800 --> 00:39.960]  and computer systems.
[00:39.960 --> 00:45.320]  That's one of the top stories on Prisonplanet.com right now is the attack on the freedom of the
[00:45.320 --> 00:51.160]  Internet intensifies, worse censorship in many areas of Europe and of course, England.
[00:51.160 --> 00:59.360]  Then we see in Communist China, in total hypocrisy, oil jumps above $126 a barrel, black water,
[00:59.360 --> 01:05.320]  the evidence shows the LA Times is reporting working with federal law enforcement inside
[01:05.320 --> 01:11.600]  the United States unique law lets police seize guns before a crime is committed in a type
[01:11.600 --> 01:12.600]  of pre-crime.
[01:12.600 --> 01:15.280]  That's out of the Hartford current.
[01:15.280 --> 01:19.680]  This is just some of what we're going to be covering today, but for the next 20 minutes,
[01:19.680 --> 01:24.440]  out of the gates, coming in hot, we have Congressman Ron Paul joining us to talk about all the
[01:24.440 --> 01:29.320]  big world events that are taking place right now.
[01:29.320 --> 01:32.840]  Congressman Ron Paul, thank you for joining us on this Monday, sir.
[01:32.840 --> 01:33.840]  Thank you.
[01:33.840 --> 01:34.840]  Good to be with you.
[01:34.840 --> 01:35.840]  What's happening?
[01:35.840 --> 01:36.840]  So much going on.
[01:36.840 --> 01:41.480]  I've got all my questions, sir, but today, Congressman, right there in the eye of the
[01:41.480 --> 01:46.440]  storm in D.C., what is most important that the listeners be made aware of?
[01:46.440 --> 01:52.000]  Well, probably the inapness which continues, which everybody knows about, I mean, it just
[01:52.000 --> 01:53.360]  gets worse every day.
[01:53.360 --> 01:58.760]  They're absolutely frozen in dealing with all the problems, you know, whether it's
[01:58.760 --> 02:03.360]  the debt, whether it's the foreign policy, whether it's the recession, depression that's
[02:03.360 --> 02:06.240]  going on, the rising cost of energy.
[02:06.240 --> 02:12.160]  I mean, all these things are happening, and I guess the biggest point is, they don't have
[02:12.160 --> 02:17.400]  the biggest idea what caused it, and they keep yelling and screaming at each other and
[02:17.400 --> 02:24.600]  shouting of what they should do, but it's all grandstanding political maneuvering, you
[02:24.600 --> 02:27.280]  know, to try to blame one side versus the other.
[02:27.280 --> 02:33.840]  It means to me that the American people can't have too many high hopes that the people in
[02:33.840 --> 02:38.200]  Washington are going to come up with any solutions here in the near future.
[02:38.200 --> 02:40.920]  Let's get into the economy first.
[02:40.920 --> 02:43.520]  Who's really running things in the private banking system?
[02:43.520 --> 02:50.440]  Is it Bernanke or some financial analyst are saying that it's really Paulson who has more
[02:50.440 --> 02:53.520]  power and is tied into the private banking system?
[02:53.520 --> 02:59.080]  Well, I think it's hard for me to separate to, I mean, you don't become Federal Reserve
[02:59.080 --> 03:02.800]  Board Chairman if you're an independent-minded person.
[03:02.800 --> 03:05.080]  You have to be part of that establishment.
[03:05.080 --> 03:09.680]  You don't become Chairman or Secretary of the Treasury in the same light.
[03:09.680 --> 03:16.040]  But I would say personality-wise, Paulson has a stronger personality, and he's more
[03:16.040 --> 03:20.960]  forceful and represents Wall Street a little more strongly than Bernanke, because he's
[03:20.960 --> 03:23.720]  been more academic.
[03:23.720 --> 03:31.000]  But they still all serve the same interest, but it may be that when the President's Working
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.400]  Group on Financial Markets meet, my guess would be that Paulson probably is leading
[03:37.400 --> 03:40.440]  the charge on all the decision-making.
[03:40.440 --> 03:44.920]  Being on the banking committee, you've got a catbird seat or at least some ideas on what
[03:44.920 --> 03:45.920]  they're planning in the future.
[03:45.920 --> 03:48.720]  Are they going to lower rates more or are they going to increase rates?
[03:48.720 --> 03:54.080]  And I mean, your analysis, Congressman, of what their financial plan is.
[03:54.080 --> 03:58.240]  Of course, you would think that somebody on the banking committee, a Congressman and a
[03:58.240 --> 04:03.080]  ranking member on the Monetary Policy Committee would have a greater insight, but the truth
[04:03.080 --> 04:08.960]  is we're kept in the dark just like everybody else, and I can't attend those meetings, so
[04:08.960 --> 04:11.080]  I have to make some guesses myself.
[04:11.080 --> 04:16.520]  But I would say, you know, that they'll probably not do anything right now, neither raise nor
[04:16.520 --> 04:17.520]  lower.
[04:17.520 --> 04:22.880]  But the point being, if the markets are reassured that they may know no significant changes
[04:22.880 --> 04:26.720]  and they kept it the same, keeping it the same is still artificial.
[04:26.720 --> 04:32.440]  You know, if the overnight rates are 2%, if they should be 6%, they're still artificially
[04:32.440 --> 04:38.440]  low and causing more problems, so everything that they do right now has to be wrong because
[04:38.440 --> 04:41.760]  they can't possibly know what the market should be telling us.
[04:41.760 --> 04:43.760]  Congressman Ron Paul, quick break.
[04:43.760 --> 04:45.280]  We'll be back in just a few minutes.
[04:45.280 --> 04:46.800]  Get more into the economy.
[04:46.800 --> 04:53.160]  Next up, we'll talk about the big event coming up in early September in Minnesota, the rally
[04:53.160 --> 04:56.240]  for the Republic, and a lot more with Congressman Ron Paul.
[04:56.240 --> 05:00.920]  Stay with us.
[05:00.920 --> 05:01.920]  David J. Smith.
[05:01.920 --> 05:02.920]  Parliament.
[05:02.920 --> 05:08.520]  If they should be 6%, they're still artificially low and causing more problems, so everything
[05:08.520 --> 05:13.520]  that they do right now has to be wrong because they can't possibly know what the market should
[05:13.520 --> 05:14.520]  be telling us.
[05:14.520 --> 05:16.800]  Congressman Ron Paul, quick break.
[05:16.800 --> 05:18.040]  We'll be back in just a few minutes.
[05:18.040 --> 05:19.040]  Get more into the economy.
[05:19.040 --> 05:25.920]  Also, we'll talk about the big event coming up in early September in Minnesota, the rally
[05:25.920 --> 05:29.040]  for the Republic, and a lot more with Congressman Ron Paul.
[05:29.040 --> 05:33.520]  Stay with us.
[05:33.520 --> 05:34.520]  David J. Smith.
[05:34.520 --> 05:39.440]  Did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government
[05:39.440 --> 05:43.120]  that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[05:43.120 --> 05:48.720]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[05:48.720 --> 05:53.960]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World
[05:53.960 --> 05:55.360]  War II?
[05:55.360 --> 06:00.920]  The Illuminati, who are worshipers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the
[06:00.920 --> 06:04.560]  Third World War, to produce their one world government.
[06:04.560 --> 06:08.280]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming about by offering you an

[06:54.920 --> 06:56.800]  crime are brought to justice.

[07:30.960 --> 07:34.200]  to Big Brother.
[07:34.200 --> 07:38.880]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime
[07:38.880 --> 07:39.880]  in the future?
[07:39.880 --> 07:42.520]  At Leysmed Inc., the future is here.
[07:42.520 --> 07:46.420]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[07:46.420 --> 07:51.240]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can kill skin cancer and breast
[07:51.240 --> 07:52.760]  tumors of any size.
[07:52.760 --> 07:57.600]  And many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.
[07:57.600 --> 08:01.040]  We offer a real solution using real science.
[08:01.040 --> 08:05.000]  Our unique approach to cancer treatment is what everyone has been waiting for.
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.880]  A simple, easy way to eliminate the threat of cancer, laser technology at its best to
[08:10.880 --> 08:39.880]  receive it.
[08:39.880 --> 08:44.860]  The mainstream media gets the public to focus in on what's happening with oil or gold or
[08:44.860 --> 08:50.720]  inflation day-to-day, instead of looking at the year-long and decade-long graphs where
[08:50.720 --> 08:54.720]  gold's going straight up, oil's going straight up, every commodity's going straight up, the
[08:54.720 --> 08:57.920]  dollar's going straight down.
[08:57.920 --> 09:01.480]  You talked a few weeks ago about something really big on the economic front coming that
[09:01.480 --> 09:06.280]  would quote, put our liberties into deep freeze.
[09:06.280 --> 09:11.240]  Can you flesh that out for us and give us more specifics with your economic outlooks
[09:11.240 --> 09:16.560]  studying economics and being on the banking committee on where we're going, looking at
[09:16.560 --> 09:21.080]  the current economic landscape and what the private fellow reserve is saying?
[09:21.080 --> 09:27.360]  Well, what I'm thinking about is the tremendous dislocation of capital that has occurred over
[09:27.360 --> 09:30.080]  the last 35 years since the Brentwoods Agreement broke down.
[09:30.080 --> 09:33.400]  We've had nothing about a world fiat currency.
[09:33.400 --> 09:40.160]  But it's already well into the correction, but I think it has a long way to go.
[09:40.160 --> 09:44.640]  And that is, we've literally pumped in hundreds of billions of dollars.
[09:44.640 --> 09:49.640]  They talked about the housing bill last week when that was finally passed, and it's open
[09:49.640 --> 09:55.960]  and they pretend it's $25 billion, but the Secretary of the Treasury actually has licensed
[09:55.960 --> 10:02.320]  to buy up all the securities relating to mortgages, so he has no restraint, and he can do that
[10:02.320 --> 10:04.560]  without coming back to Congress.
[10:04.560 --> 10:08.960]  But if you look at what the Fed has already done, they've pumped in hundreds of billions
[10:08.960 --> 10:13.560]  of dollars already, and the market really hasn't discounted that at all.
[10:13.560 --> 10:18.720]  I saw an article that said that if another country had even hinted to our disc, their
[10:18.720 --> 10:21.200]  currency would have been wiped out immediately.
[10:21.200 --> 10:26.720]  It would have been so disastrous, and yet there's so much illogical trust placed in
[10:26.720 --> 10:30.480]  the dollar still, even though it's being lost and it's going down.
[10:30.480 --> 10:35.720]  I think someday somebody's going to wake up and say, you know, this dollar is a fraud
[10:35.720 --> 10:40.760]  and they're going to leave the dollar, and the reason I think about this in light of
[10:40.760 --> 10:44.560]  our foreign policy is, you know, there's still a bunch of people in Washington that want
[10:44.560 --> 10:46.040]  to go and bomb Iran.
[10:46.040 --> 10:51.680]  If they do that, I mean, just the psychology of this and the pressure on the military and
[10:51.680 --> 10:57.880]  the pressure on the oil and everything, that would be the precipitating event I see as
[10:57.880 --> 11:04.120]  a financial collapse, and when you have that, you have a political crisis, and I just happen
[11:04.120 --> 11:05.120]  to believe we're vulnerable.
[11:05.120 --> 11:07.800]  It's just that I don't have a timetable.
[11:07.800 --> 11:12.120]  I can't say next week it's going to happen or next month, but I do believe it's going
[11:12.120 --> 11:16.400]  to happen unless we wake up and right now it doesn't look like we're waking up very
[11:16.400 --> 11:17.400]  fast.
[11:17.400 --> 11:21.760]  The Federal Reserve has signaled for years they plan to just print more money, issue
[11:21.760 --> 11:32.040]  more liquidity, now Barack Obama proposed Saturday a $150 billion or $1,000 credit per
[11:32.040 --> 11:39.400]  U.S. citizen for increasing energy costs, but that's again borrowing from the private
[11:39.400 --> 11:46.280]  bankers again and borrowing from foreign countries again instead of fixing the problems
[11:46.280 --> 11:51.520]  we have with our energy system of not enough refineries and not allowing drilling in places
[11:51.520 --> 11:52.920]  like Anwar and Alaska.
[11:52.920 --> 11:59.040]  Congressman, what's your take on Barack Obama wanting a $150 billion energy check to be sent
[11:59.040 --> 12:00.040]  out to the American people?
[12:00.040 --> 12:05.280]  Well, it's just more of the same, and it should send shutters through the market.
[12:05.280 --> 12:11.520]  I mean, in time that is what will push up gold and the dollar down, but the immediate
[12:11.520 --> 12:16.160]  results haven't been that way because, of course, he's not president yet and they may
[12:16.160 --> 12:21.800]  well do that later, so markets are sort of fickle, sometimes they react immediately in
[12:21.800 --> 12:25.400]  the wrong direction, then they finally wake up and they do the other thing.
[12:25.400 --> 12:32.400]  But this whole notion that Barack Obama has something new and wonderful to offer is just
[12:32.400 --> 12:38.200]  silly talk, and he just has more spending, but if we could only criticize him and say,
[12:38.200 --> 12:43.200]  oh, the answer is just vote for the Republican, and the Republicans will save us, we can't
[12:43.200 --> 12:44.200]  do that either.
[12:44.200 --> 12:48.880]  And I think that's what the American people are waking up to, realizing that neither party
[12:48.880 --> 12:54.200]  is offering us any solution, but this whole idea that we can either appropriate more money
[12:54.200 --> 12:59.560]  or print more money and inflate our way out of it or bar our way out of it, that's coming
[12:59.560 --> 13:04.840]  to an end, and I think that's what the American people are sensing, and the frustrations with
[13:04.840 --> 13:08.640]  the American people are way ahead of what's going on in Washington.
[13:08.640 --> 13:14.680]  A crisis of confidence, you've always spoken going back decades about the fact that once
[13:14.680 --> 13:19.000]  the government started going bankrupt, once the dollar started imploding and eroding because
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.760]  of the policies they were setting, you knew that that would eventually precipitate out,
[13:24.760 --> 13:29.400]  that there would come a point where we were at a crossroads of would the government be
[13:29.400 --> 13:33.560]  able to offer the solution of even more government and bring us into total tyranny once we came
[13:33.560 --> 13:38.200]  to the crossroads, or would we, liberty lovers, those that want to legalize freedom, get
[13:38.200 --> 13:43.400]  to the point of educating the public enough so that they push for a real solution, a true
[13:43.400 --> 13:46.880]  free market, a Republican form of government.
[13:46.880 --> 13:52.560]  A, do you think we're approaching that true flash point or crossroads, and B, which way
[13:52.560 --> 13:54.560]  do you see us going?
[13:54.560 --> 14:00.600]  Well, I can't say for sure, and I don't think anybody knows, but we're getting awfully close
[14:00.600 --> 14:01.720]  to that.
[14:01.720 --> 14:07.520]  I have concluded that we will not, you know, gradually improve ourselves in Washington
[14:07.520 --> 14:11.960]  that we get a better Congress and we work our way out of it, which, in theory, you could
[14:11.960 --> 14:12.960]  do that.
[14:12.960 --> 14:16.360]  If you did the right things, you'd suffer a bit, but we could work our way out of it.
[14:16.360 --> 14:20.480]  I think we're going to continue to have the politicians always do the bailouts as well
[14:20.480 --> 14:25.240]  as treasury and as well as the Federal Reserve, which means that we will come to a crisis.
[14:25.240 --> 14:27.640]  And the question is, is what you bring up?
[14:27.640 --> 14:33.640]  Will there be enough of us to pick up the pieces, or will the authoritarians who ruin
[14:33.640 --> 14:38.800]  the system come in and hold it together just by more brute force?
[14:38.800 --> 14:45.280]  And history says that, generally, what happens is brute force is used to hold the people
[14:45.280 --> 14:46.280]  together.
[14:46.280 --> 14:51.760]  And I'm just hoping and working for the day, believing that there's enough of us left.
[14:51.760 --> 14:59.640]  There is a remnant, and we have access to spreading our messages through radio and through
[14:59.640 --> 15:04.680]  the Internet, that there will be enough of us that we can stand up to the authoritarians.
[15:04.680 --> 15:07.280]  But I think the results are yet to be found out.
[15:07.280 --> 15:11.120]  Well, Congressman, we're gearing up to educate the public peacefully.
[15:11.120 --> 15:15.240]  Meanwhile, the authoritarians, in all their major white papers, Defense Department, Ministry
[15:15.240 --> 15:20.240]  of Defense in England, they admit they're gearing up to counter the people who don't
[15:20.240 --> 15:25.480]  want to go into bondage and third world serfdom and this whole high-tech overlay.
[15:25.480 --> 15:34.080]  And so, clearly, the enemy of liberty understands that and is gearing up with propaganda, militarily,
[15:34.080 --> 15:36.600]  police-wise, to oppress the people.
[15:36.600 --> 15:40.800]  Can you speak to that in this latest example of where they've just announced without warrants,
[15:40.800 --> 15:44.280]  they're going to seize everybody's computers, they're already started it at the border and
[15:44.280 --> 15:53.040]  send them off for months for them to download the contents of your laptop or your iPhone,
[15:53.040 --> 15:58.200]  and then they're having, quote, private corporations who are sharing the data, I mean, it's a race
[15:58.200 --> 15:59.200]  towards Orwell.
[15:59.200 --> 16:04.200]  Yeah, and it's always, you know, for good reasons, I mean, somebody coming into this,
[16:04.200 --> 16:08.520]  they start with the borders and they say, well, you might be terrorists, so we have to know
[16:08.520 --> 16:12.520]  what's in everybody's computer, so it's always playing on this, we're going to take care
[16:12.520 --> 16:13.520]  of you.
[16:13.520 --> 16:17.840]  But just think of all these lists and ID pages and everything else that they want to have
[16:17.840 --> 16:24.120]  national ID cards, it's always done to keep out the illegals, and yet at the same time,
[16:24.120 --> 16:30.360]  we know that they're not very serious about that, but we know some person one time said,
[16:30.360 --> 16:35.720]  you know, maybe we ought to do better at the borders to keep the illegals out, but if we
[16:35.720 --> 16:40.080]  have too many fences, it may be that those fences are going to be used to keep us all
[16:40.080 --> 16:41.680]  in, in the border.
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.160]  The border, since I don't believe them being very serious about protecting our borders,
[16:45.160 --> 16:49.400]  every time they pretend to protect the borders, I get very worried, and this whole idea that
[16:49.400 --> 16:53.560]  they're going to seize computers at the border without a search warrant means that although
[16:53.560 --> 16:59.560]  it hasn't happened domestically and it's just starting at the borders, I mean, we're
[16:59.560 --> 17:07.120]  in for a lot of trouble because everything is more, more lists on people, I mean, there
[17:07.120 --> 17:13.040]  are so many databases in Washington, maybe the only saving grace will be that they'll
[17:13.040 --> 17:17.160]  have so much information, they won't be able to keep up with it, it won't be very efficient,
[17:17.160 --> 17:19.360]  but in the meantime, they make a lot of mistakes.
[17:19.360 --> 17:24.720]  Just think about the list they have now on Suspected Terrorists, I mean, hundreds of thousands
[17:24.720 --> 17:29.080]  of people on that list, once your name gets on there, you can't get it off, so, so much
[17:29.080 --> 17:34.440]  abuse and so much distrust that exists from this, so.
[17:34.440 --> 17:40.360]  Congressman, what about federal funding for police to go knock on people's doors and quote,
[17:40.360 --> 17:45.080]  ask to look for illegal guns, randomly, now the Illinois governor has announced two weeks
[17:45.080 --> 17:50.400]  ago NBC and Chicago Tribune that they want to quote, use the National Guard in anti-gun
[17:50.400 --> 17:55.840]  sweeps, I mean, it's, it's, it's getting so bad, what should we do about this?
[17:55.840 --> 18:01.000]  Well, if it's a state thing, you have to raise a fuss, if it's federal money, of course,
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.360]  we're supposed to take care of that, but isn't this a perfect example of how the government
[18:05.360 --> 18:10.080]  is being used to destroy our liberties, and there was a time when it was thought the government
[18:10.080 --> 18:14.120]  was there to protect our liberties, the government is supposed to there to make sure you have
[18:14.120 --> 18:18.160]  your second amendment, but here they're using the government to take your second amendment
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.040]  rights away, what happened, you know, in Katrina, in New Orleans, they went in there and took
[18:22.040 --> 18:26.080]  guns away, well, they were supposed to go in there and protect property, which means
[18:26.080 --> 18:30.280]  that you had a right to go to your property, use your own gun and protect it, but now the
[18:30.280 --> 18:33.600]  government comes in and say, you can't even get on your property, if you have a gun we're
[18:33.600 --> 18:37.920]  going to take it away from you, and why the American people put up with this, and they
[18:37.920 --> 18:42.600]  have been doing it for so long, I don't know, but I do know there's a growing number of
[18:42.600 --> 18:46.920]  individuals like us who are saying enough is enough.
[18:46.920 --> 18:52.200]  Congressman, I want to get into the campaign for liberty, I want to get into the big rally
[18:52.200 --> 18:55.280]  coming up, the tickets are selling out fast, some of the great people are going to be there,
[18:55.280 --> 18:58.400]  like Jesse Ventura and others who, by the way, I talked to this morning about an event
[18:58.400 --> 19:04.120]  we're doing, I'll tell you about later listeners, Congressman Iran, I mean, you're up there,
[19:04.120 --> 19:08.640]  last time you were on you said that colleagues of yours are walking around talking about
[19:08.640 --> 19:13.680]  how great it'd be to nuke Iran, Israel saying they may go in, even if the U.S. doesn't back
[19:13.680 --> 19:19.960]  it, we're getting mixed signals, Barack Obama said last week to the Senate Democrats, hey,
[19:19.960 --> 19:25.440]  if we don't get these sanctions, then there probably is going to be an attack on Iran,
[19:25.440 --> 19:29.240]  what is the best intel you've got, are they planning to hit Iran and win?
[19:29.240 --> 19:36.080]  Well, I don't know of any precise plans, but I know that the neoconservatives are still
[19:36.080 --> 19:42.400]  in charge in Washington, although every once in a while you'll hear Condoleezza Rice say
[19:42.400 --> 19:47.000]  something and say, oh, maybe she represents the moderates, but at the same time she says
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.920]  something like, let's talk to them for a day, the next day she said, but remember, nothing
[19:51.920 --> 19:58.360]  is taken off the table, so the influence is still there that wants it to happen, but
[19:58.360 --> 20:04.120]  I don't, they probably themselves don't have a day set to do it their way, they're waiting
[20:04.120 --> 20:09.160]  for an opportunity and something will come along now, whether it happens in the next
[20:09.160 --> 20:13.400]  month or two is still unknown, but the one thing that American people have to realize
[20:13.400 --> 20:19.280]  is just because on occasion they hear Obama say something that's less aggressive and he
[20:19.280 --> 20:24.520]  wants to maybe bring some troops out of Iraq, you have to remember, he's the one that even
[20:24.520 --> 20:30.360]  beat John McCain in saying, we need more troops in Afghanistan and he has never backed away
[20:30.360 --> 20:36.920]  from even a nuclear first strike on Iran because he won't take anything off the table either.
[20:36.920 --> 20:41.240]  Congressman, we've only got a few minutes left with you, specifically, you've warned
[20:41.240 --> 20:47.080]  several times on the House floor and on this radio show about provocations, Gulf of Tonkin
[20:47.080 --> 20:52.120]  style events that almost happened a few months ago in the Strait of Hormuz with the Iranian
[20:52.120 --> 20:57.200]  boats and the fake radio transmission, Sy Hirsh reported two months ago that the White
[20:57.200 --> 21:02.720]  House, quote, once a provocation, he got that from inside sources and White House meetings,
[21:02.720 --> 21:08.960]  you're aware of that, A, that's A, B, did you know that Keith Overman did report Friday
[21:08.960 --> 21:14.520]  that Sy Hirsh has now reported that the White House wanted provocations and Dick Cheney
[21:14.520 --> 21:20.040]  proposed creating fake Iranian patrol boats, putting Navy SEALs in them and having a shootout
[21:20.040 --> 21:23.880]  between the larger missile cruisers and the Navy SEALs.
[21:23.880 --> 21:24.880]  Were you aware of that?
[21:24.880 --> 21:26.720]  And if you are, what's your take?
[21:26.720 --> 21:30.640]  Well, I heard that story.
[21:30.640 --> 21:34.160]  I don't have proof of it, but I believe it's very, very possible.
[21:34.160 --> 21:40.760]  I mean, this is the kind of, didn't Cheney do something early on about using a UN symbol
[21:40.760 --> 21:43.200]  and hitting it and then blaming it on the Iranians?
[21:43.200 --> 21:44.200]  White House memo.
[21:44.200 --> 21:45.200]  They're not going to do anything.
[21:45.200 --> 21:48.840]  Well, I tell you what, Congressman, I just skipped the break.
[21:48.840 --> 21:50.640]  You can stay with us three more minutes.
[21:50.640 --> 21:57.120]  I will pull Keith Overman up, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, see the news moves so fast, it's already
[21:57.120 --> 21:58.120]  off the main page.
[21:58.120 --> 22:02.600]  No, sir, I'm telling you, Keith Overman reported on it, there is a YouTube video of Sy Hirsh
[22:02.600 --> 22:07.000]  at a media conference saying that there were a dozen provocations.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.360]  He said, I'll only tell you about one, Dick Cheney proposed, but the military shot it
[22:11.360 --> 22:14.040]  down because they didn't want to kill our own troops.
[22:14.040 --> 22:18.360]  Dick Cheney, this is huge, we need your help to look into this and then cover it.
[22:18.360 --> 22:23.640]  Dick Cheney came right out and said this, sir.
[22:23.640 --> 22:24.640]  I believe him.
[22:24.640 --> 22:28.240]  Well, it's just unbelievable, what should we do about this?
[22:28.240 --> 22:31.720]  Well, I don't know how much more we can do.
[22:31.720 --> 22:36.760]  I mean, we have to let the people know first is get knowledge, individuals like myself
[22:36.760 --> 22:41.840]  and we only have a few in Washington that speak in Washington that try to slow that
[22:41.840 --> 22:42.840]  up.
[22:42.840 --> 22:49.920]  You know, in one minor way, I think we did a little bit of good on that H. Congress 362,
[22:49.920 --> 22:55.520]  I believe, where they were going to put on the absolute blockade of Iran and we spoke
[22:55.520 --> 22:58.440]  out on that and that has settled down.
[22:58.440 --> 23:04.000]  It may still come up, but because several of us spoke out against it, I think they
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.200]  backed off because they had to admit it really was a blockade.
[23:08.200 --> 23:11.680]  They proposed that as if, oh, no, this is just a few sanctions, this is not really
[23:11.680 --> 23:19.760]  a blockade, so we're outnumbered and we're outgunned and that's why it's so dangerous.
[23:19.760 --> 23:27.600]  Congressman Spinda, a few minutes telling us about the campaign for liberty to tell us
[23:27.600 --> 23:31.480]  about what's coming up with this huge rally for the Republic.
[23:31.480 --> 23:37.360]  Well, you know, the Republicans' Convention starts, I think, it's on September 1st and
[23:37.360 --> 23:39.320]  runs for several days.
[23:39.320 --> 23:45.480]  And we had what many consider the very successful campaign the last year and a half and we wanted
[23:45.480 --> 23:52.160]  to conclude it on a very positive note, so it was very clear that we would not be allowed
[23:52.160 --> 23:58.720]  to participate in the Republican Convention, so we decided we would have our own.
[23:58.720 --> 24:02.240]  And so we're about eight miles from where the Republicans are holding their rally as
[24:02.240 --> 24:04.280]  a campaign for liberty.
[24:04.280 --> 24:09.560]  I see the other candidates as campaign for power, which is exactly opposite of what we
[24:09.560 --> 24:13.520]  do, we campaign for liberty and we wanted to be a very positive note.
[24:13.520 --> 24:17.960]  We're going to have a lot of music and we're going to have a lot of speakers and it's going
[24:17.960 --> 24:20.160]  to be talking about the Republic.
[24:20.160 --> 24:26.720]  It's a rally for the Republic and anybody interested should go to campaignforliberty.com
[24:26.720 --> 24:28.720]  and join us and come there.
[24:28.720 --> 24:31.040]  We expect to have a lot of enthusiasm.
[24:31.040 --> 24:35.800]  We have one reporter called Jesse, our press guy, and said, look, if you guys fill that
[24:35.800 --> 24:39.400]  place, he says you will be the news for the whole week.
[24:39.400 --> 24:43.880]  So there's a little bit of PR stuff involved here, too, and that is our goal.
[24:43.880 --> 24:49.320]  We're working and the numbers look good until it's over and successful, you know, I do worry
[24:49.320 --> 24:50.320]  a little bit.
[24:50.320 --> 24:53.440]  Well, you've already sold more than half the tickets and you've got three weeks to
[24:53.440 --> 24:54.760]  sell the rest.
[24:54.760 --> 24:58.240]  This is going to be a huge success, guaranteed it's going to overflow.
[24:58.240 --> 25:02.480]  In fact, Jesse told me last week he's already looking for overflow areas for other people
[25:02.480 --> 25:04.040]  nearby.
[25:04.040 --> 25:07.080]  But Congressman, let me just play you a minute of this, get your comment on it and we'll
[25:07.080 --> 25:08.280]  let you go.
[25:08.280 --> 25:10.560]  This is World's Worst President.
[25:10.560 --> 25:11.560]  This is Keith Oberman.
[25:11.560 --> 25:15.280]  Now, understand, we have the Psyhurst clip where he lays it out and says we just didn't
[25:15.280 --> 25:19.280]  put it in the newspaper, in the magazine, but here it is.
[25:19.280 --> 25:22.200]  This is the audio from Friday's Keith Oberman.
[25:22.200 --> 25:27.320]  He told the Campus Progress Journalism Conference that in a meeting in the vice president's
[25:27.320 --> 25:32.520]  office, members of the administration sat around brainstorming ideas to provoke a war
[25:32.520 --> 25:33.520]  with Iran.
[25:33.520 --> 25:38.320]  Quote, the one that interested me the most was, why don't we build, we in our shipyard
[25:38.320 --> 25:43.720]  build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats, put Navy SEALs on them with a lot
[25:43.720 --> 25:48.760]  of arms and the next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz, start a shootup,
[25:48.760 --> 25:52.600]  might cost some lives and it was rejected because you can't have Americans killing Americans.
[25:52.600 --> 25:56.840]  That's the kind of, that's the level of stuff we're talking about, provocation, but that
[25:56.840 --> 25:57.840]  was rejected.
[25:57.840 --> 26:00.280]  Can you see this happening in Cheney's office?
[26:00.280 --> 26:01.280]  Sure you can.
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.720]  Can you see Cheney getting all happy and worked up and almost smiling?
[26:05.720 --> 26:06.720]  Sure you can.
[26:06.720 --> 26:10.080]  Can you see when they get to the part about Americans being killed and you can't do that
[26:10.080 --> 26:16.240]  and he just stares at them all and says, so.
[26:16.240 --> 26:22.480]  Vice President Dick Cheney, today's worst person in the world.
[26:22.480 --> 26:26.480]  Congressman, to me, this is a huge deal because in the actual clip that I'll email your
[26:26.480 --> 26:31.760]  staff, this is at a major journalism conference in front of hundreds of people and journalists,
[26:31.760 --> 26:34.840]  he says there were 11 other staged events they planned.
[26:34.840 --> 26:38.320]  Then we have the White House memo where they wanted to fly the U.S. planes, pan it up like
[26:38.320 --> 26:40.400]  the U.N. low to get them shot down.
[26:40.400 --> 26:43.800]  This is a big deal and we need to make sure there's an investigation.
[26:43.800 --> 26:45.680]  We need to know those other 11 targets.
[26:45.680 --> 26:46.680]  Can you comment on this?
[26:46.680 --> 26:52.520]  Well, the sad part is, is that a lot of people won't be surprised, I imagine.
[26:52.520 --> 26:54.160]  You weren't totally surprised.
[26:54.160 --> 26:55.160]  No sir.
[26:55.160 --> 27:01.320]  That's the really sad part about it, but it is tragic, it's sad and we have to do our
[27:01.320 --> 27:02.320]  very best.
[27:02.320 --> 27:03.520]  And this exposure is great.
[27:03.520 --> 27:04.680]  I think this is fine.
[27:04.680 --> 27:11.080]  Let the people know what's going on and maybe they'll wake up when it happens, but I'm
[27:11.080 --> 27:12.080]  afraid to death.
[27:12.080 --> 27:18.360]  All it has to do is have one of our ships hit and a bunch of Americans killed and one
[27:18.360 --> 27:22.960]  or two new stations up, it was the Iranians, the country's going to be ready to go to war.
[27:22.960 --> 27:27.360]  I mean, they'll be even willing to call a draft to say, well, we have to go.
[27:27.360 --> 27:28.440]  We have to save Israel.
[27:28.440 --> 27:36.000]  We have to go and march in so we need a draft and that's the worst part that I fear.
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.680]  So, I guess we have to keep doing what we can do to expose the truth.
[27:40.680 --> 27:45.120]  Congressman, you don't toot your own horn, but in closing, it was almost two years ago.
[27:45.120 --> 27:51.280]  I know it was in early 2007 and I know you gave speeches similar to this even before
[27:51.280 --> 27:56.280]  that, saying, I'm afraid they're going to stage a Gulf of Tonkin in the Strait of Hormuz.
[27:56.280 --> 28:02.200]  Did you get intel on that or are you, I mean, how on earth were you able to predict something
[28:02.200 --> 28:03.960]  like this?
[28:03.960 --> 28:07.600]  And then now they already tried it with the PT boats a few months ago with fake radio
[28:07.600 --> 28:08.600]  transmissions.
[28:08.600 --> 28:12.680]  Now, Gary Hart's writing letters to Iran saying they may stage a Gulf of Tonkin.
[28:12.680 --> 28:15.080]  I mean, how did you know that?
[28:15.080 --> 28:17.440]  I didn't absolutely know that.
[28:17.440 --> 28:20.920]  It just sort of was the fact that they've done it before.
[28:20.920 --> 28:27.480]  And I know what the Neocons want and they did it for Vietnam and they've done it over
[28:27.480 --> 28:30.480]  the centuries, you know, the various wars.
[28:30.480 --> 28:37.680]  So often there seems to be an incident with the Navy and with the ship, so it must be
[28:37.680 --> 28:38.840]  easier to do it.
[28:38.840 --> 28:43.120]  So, it was just strong suspicion in relationship to the kind of people that we have running
[28:43.120 --> 28:44.120]  our government.
[28:44.120 --> 28:47.920]  Well, by exposing it, that takes this tool of staged events and breaks it so they can't
[28:47.920 --> 28:48.920]  use it.
[28:48.920 --> 28:53.440]  Again, huge guests coming up, folks can go buy tickets right now.
[28:53.440 --> 28:55.160]  You've got several websites.
[28:55.160 --> 28:58.040]  Is the best one, Rally for the Republic?
[28:58.040 --> 28:59.920]  That or Campaign for Liberty.
[28:59.920 --> 29:02.160]  And that's Rally for theRepublic.com?
[29:02.160 --> 29:03.160]  Right.
[29:03.160 --> 29:07.920]  And the Campaign for Liberty website, we have links to those up on InfoWars.com.
[29:07.920 --> 29:11.400]  Also Congressman, give us your house website, give us some of your other websites.
[29:11.400 --> 29:16.840]  Well, the best one to go to to look at all my websites would be RonPaul.org and it lists
[29:16.840 --> 29:21.600]  about six websites, the political websites and the PAC website and the different things
[29:21.600 --> 29:25.080]  in the educational website, RonPaul.org for all the websites.
[29:25.080 --> 29:28.640]  Okay, that's the big portal to all the world of RonPaul and Liberty.
[29:28.640 --> 29:31.360]  Thank you so much for your tireless efforts to defend freedom.
[29:31.360 --> 29:34.400]  I know you're going to be popping in for about five minutes later in the week to make that
[29:34.400 --> 29:38.560]  big announcement we were going to make today, but Jesse Ventura, many others at the event,
[29:38.560 --> 29:39.560]  get your tickets now.
[29:39.560 --> 29:40.560]  Congressman, thank you.
[29:40.560 --> 29:41.560]  Thanks for having me.
[29:41.560 --> 29:42.560]  You bet.
[29:42.560 --> 29:46.560]  Well, that was a bombshell interview, ladies and gentlemen, and it's only going to get
[29:46.560 --> 29:48.960]  more powerful after this break.
[29:48.960 --> 29:51.000]  Prison Planet is now censored by the British government.
[29:51.000 --> 29:54.320]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:54.320 --> 29:58.400]  All right, Paul Watson is all set.
[29:58.400 --> 29:59.400]  What's that?
[29:59.400 --> 30:01.360]  The world of RonPaul and Liberty.
[30:01.360 --> 30:04.040]  Thank you so much for your tireless efforts to defend freedom.
[30:04.040 --> 30:07.080]  I know you're going to be popping in for about five minutes later in the week to make that
[30:07.080 --> 30:11.240]  big announcement we were going to make today, but Jesse Ventura, many others at the event,
[30:11.240 --> 30:12.240]  get your tickets now.
[30:12.240 --> 30:13.240]  Congressman, thank you.
[30:13.240 --> 30:14.240]  Thanks for having me.
[30:14.240 --> 30:15.240]  You bet.
[30:15.240 --> 30:19.320]  Well, that was a bombshell interview, ladies and gentlemen, and it's only going to get
[30:19.320 --> 30:21.680]  more powerful after this break.
[30:21.680 --> 30:23.680]  Prison Planet is now censored by the British government.
[30:23.680 --> 30:27.400]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[30:27.400 --> 30:35.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:35.320 --> 30:40.160]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages
[30:40.160 --> 30:42.760]  already destroying millions of American families.
[30:42.760 --> 30:46.800]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[30:46.800 --> 30:50.760]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[30:50.760 --> 30:56.880]  The only solution is to use now and store for later great flavored super bulk foods that
[30:56.880 --> 31:00.760]  cost half as much as your groceries cost last year.
[31:00.760 --> 31:05.280]  Get on the web at eFoodsDirect.com and find a two month grab and go kit.
[31:05.280 --> 31:10.040]  This easy fix supply gives you two months worth of three great meals a day.
[31:10.040 --> 31:12.320]  The cost about $5 a day.
[31:12.320 --> 31:18.720]  eFoodsDirect.com also has a complete bulk supply of super food at half the cost of last
[31:18.720 --> 31:20.040]  year's groceries.
[31:20.040 --> 31:23.120]  Call 800-409-5633.
[31:23.120 --> 31:27.520]  The rest of the world is starving, but what happens in your piece of America is up to
[31:27.520 --> 31:28.520]  you.
[31:28.520 --> 31:31.520]  Call 800-409-5633.
[31:31.520 --> 31:39.680]  If this is your paycheck and this is your debt, what are your options?
[31:39.680 --> 31:44.520]  Call bankruptcy and tread water the next seven years?
[31:44.520 --> 31:50.720]  Or make a call for Care One Credit Counseling Services and start getting out of debt today.
[31:50.720 --> 31:55.680]  A Care One Credit Counseling Agency can help you get immediate relief from stress caused
[31:55.680 --> 32:00.000]  by debt and you'll have one lower monthly payment instead of the pile you have right
[32:00.000 --> 32:01.000]  now.
[32:01.000 --> 32:05.960]  Call a Care One agent today and you can start saving hundreds of dollars in fees and interest
[32:05.960 --> 32:06.960]  payments.

[32:11.200 --> 32:12.200]  too.
[32:12.200 --> 32:15.200]  Call 800-498-2981.
[32:15.200 --> 32:22.440]  800-498-2981 and find out how you can lower your monthly payments up to 57%.
[32:22.440 --> 32:25.560]  One 15-minute phone call can change your life.
[32:25.560 --> 32:28.560]  Call 800-498-2981.
[32:28.560 --> 32:31.120]  800-498-2981.
[32:31.120 --> 32:33.200]  Provider and licensing details are available.
[32:33.200 --> 32:35.160]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[32:35.160 --> 32:39.680]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[32:39.680 --> 32:41.200]  hour there is hope.
[32:41.200 --> 32:44.000]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[32:44.000 --> 32:48.480]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[32:48.480 --> 32:50.000]  World Order master plan.
[32:50.000 --> 32:54.240]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[32:54.240 --> 32:59.480]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[32:59.480 --> 33:02.480]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[33:02.480 --> 33:05.520]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded.
[33:05.520 --> 33:07.880]  The Alex Jones Show.
[33:07.880 --> 33:18.640]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[33:18.640 --> 33:20.840]  It was the best of times.
[33:20.840 --> 33:24.520]  It was the worst of times.
[33:24.520 --> 33:34.680]  The fact that the British government is censoring PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, TruthNews.us,
[33:34.680 --> 33:38.880]  Infowars.net is a big victory for us.
[33:38.880 --> 33:41.320]  It shows that we're hurting them badly.
[33:41.320 --> 33:49.160]  When they carried out their attack with Mossad and CIA back on 7-7 in 2005 with the London
[33:49.160 --> 33:55.880]  bombings, when you typed London bombing or bombing into Google for at least a month straight,
[33:55.880 --> 34:02.520]  the number one thing under the term bombing or London bombing.
[34:02.520 --> 34:08.280]  The number one thing was PrisonPlanet.com links.
[34:08.280 --> 34:15.840]  Now, we have caught major internet companies in England, Australia, Germany, the United
[34:15.840 --> 34:19.960]  States, blockinginfowars.com.
[34:19.960 --> 34:24.280]  If you will notice on most major cable modem systems in the U.S. now, if you type an address
[34:24.280 --> 34:26.720]  in wrong, it doesn't go to a blank screen on your computer.
[34:26.720 --> 34:31.280]  It'll be Time Warner Roadrunner or it'll be Comcast Cable.
[34:31.280 --> 34:33.960]  And they're running everything through their systems.
[34:33.960 --> 34:36.020]  They don't need to tap anything.
[34:36.020 --> 34:39.440]  You go through them as a gate.
[34:39.440 --> 34:42.920]  Your computer is coupled first into their system.
[34:42.920 --> 34:50.320]  Now, I learned a decade ago, really I guess I started Infowars.com 11 years ago in 1997.
[34:50.320 --> 34:58.000]  So even then, public schools, Dell computers, many University of Texas systems, then we
[34:58.000 --> 35:03.640]  got calls and people mailed us the sheets where the university had screens saying that
[35:03.640 --> 35:05.480]  it was blocked.
[35:05.480 --> 35:10.600]  Municipal libraries, state libraries, university libraries.
[35:10.600 --> 35:12.360]  So this is one form of censorship.
[35:12.360 --> 35:16.280]  That we found out of the scores of internet filtration systems that people subscribe to
[35:16.280 --> 35:20.680]  and download or in the old days you would mail off for a disc that would have thousands
[35:20.680 --> 35:22.520]  of websites banned on it.
[35:22.520 --> 35:24.040]  And there's a family of these.
[35:24.040 --> 35:29.320]  There's porn, hacking, hate, and gambling.
[35:29.320 --> 35:35.880]  That's the four genres that people don't want my children seeing this.
[35:35.880 --> 35:40.440]  I'm going to download this program or I'm going to buy this disc and install it.
[35:40.440 --> 35:48.400]  And we are included in hacking in many of those private systems.
[35:48.400 --> 35:53.960]  We are listed as a hacker website, nothing about hacking on our website.
[35:53.960 --> 35:59.440]  And we are also listed as a filtration system for hate.
[35:59.440 --> 36:01.240]  Now they've added a fifth to some of these filters.
[36:01.240 --> 36:03.120]  There's only one way they're censoring.
[36:03.120 --> 36:04.120]  There's many.
[36:04.120 --> 36:10.360]  They hit you from multiple sides, multi-headed Hydra.
[36:10.360 --> 36:11.960]  Now they're adding piracy.
[36:11.960 --> 36:19.840]  Now we're not on those lists, but it's kind of like the TSA list that has over a million
[36:19.840 --> 36:23.440]  Americans on it or the criminal list that has over eight million Americans on it that
[36:23.440 --> 36:28.160]  people don't even have convictions that are on it.
[36:28.160 --> 36:32.440]  This is a control grid to track and trace and make us second class citizens.
[36:32.440 --> 36:41.080]  Now under Internet 2, one facet of that plan, there's multiple tracks running on that, Comcast,
[36:41.080 --> 36:45.560]  Time Warner, others are doing it right here in Texas, Comcast is doing it in New York.
[36:45.560 --> 36:50.520]  Other major, the two major companies have announced two weeks ago in Canada that they're
[36:50.520 --> 36:54.520]  going to decide what sites you visit and they're only going to allow a couple thousand sites.
[36:54.520 --> 36:59.120]  It isn't just going to be infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[36:59.120 --> 37:05.360]  It is already just the vast majority of the Internet and so your computer becomes a glorified
[37:05.360 --> 37:10.720]  cable system with only a few thousand websites that you can visit.
[37:10.720 --> 37:14.360]  Now we told you years ago this was going to happen because we could read the minutes of
[37:14.360 --> 37:17.880]  the Internet 2 meetings they've had in London, that they've had in Tokyo, that they've had
[37:17.880 --> 37:21.680]  in Austin, Texas, they've had in Chicago, San Francisco, what three years ago it was
[37:21.680 --> 37:26.880]  in Austin and they always announced at the beginning, it's a consortium of private corporations,
[37:26.880 --> 37:31.400]  countries and government in DARPA and other foreign governments that quote, the Internet
[37:31.400 --> 37:34.960]  is dead and they say they're going to not fix the old hubs of the Internet, they're
[37:34.960 --> 37:39.360]  going to let those degrade, they say that's their right to do that.
[37:39.360 --> 37:44.120]  They also want the authorization by the federal government and the FCC.
[37:44.120 --> 37:48.080]  That Comcast just got told Friday that they have to stop doing what they're doing, filtering
[37:48.080 --> 37:52.400]  out the majority of the web and they are saying they're going to disregard the FCC, they don't
[37:52.400 --> 37:54.440]  have that regulatory power.
[37:54.440 --> 37:59.680]  So the web was built to be free and open, you pay for it with your websites you pay
[37:59.680 --> 38:03.840]  for, the people that are serving you pay for it with their servers and their bandwidth,
[38:03.840 --> 38:08.480]  you pay for it with your Internet connection, we're getting more Internet connectivity,
[38:08.480 --> 38:12.320]  we're getting more bandwidth, not lessed, they try to have Ted Stevens come out and
[38:12.320 --> 38:16.240]  say oh the pie's small, it's not getting bigger, we have to restrict it, now he's indicted
[38:16.240 --> 38:20.160]  for all his crimes and there's no alleging those.
[38:20.160 --> 38:29.080]  So we need listeners to understand this is happening, this is coming down now, this has
[38:29.080 --> 38:33.080]  been declared.
[38:33.080 --> 38:44.520]  Now Paul Watson has gone to China, Paul Watson took a trip there last year to Tibet, Paul
[38:44.520 --> 38:49.360]  Watson could get on PrismPlanet.com from Communist China, but in England and we keep getting
[38:49.360 --> 38:55.640]  reports from listeners and emails and they send us screenshots of it happening.
[38:55.640 --> 38:59.760]  Another way they're attacking is quote the government's going to offer everyone free
[38:59.760 --> 39:07.760]  broadband wireless in Western Europe, in the United States, in South Korea, in Singapore
[39:07.760 --> 39:13.520]  and many other countries, first world nations, quote free, you're paying for it through tax
[39:13.520 --> 39:23.200]  money and then they are demanding that anyone in that area who is taking the free broadband
[39:23.200 --> 39:27.040]  basically click on an agreement waving their rights to be tracked, to be traced, to be
[39:27.040 --> 39:28.040]  controlled.
[39:28.040 --> 39:31.160]  So see they're just making the new Internet where you'll have to have a sub-website on
[39:31.160 --> 39:34.600]  one of their major websites, there's only going to be 100 of them under Internet too
[39:34.600 --> 39:39.880]  and then nomoreinfowars.com, it'll be myspace-infowars.com and they can restrict your bulletins, shut
[39:39.880 --> 39:46.200]  you down, delete you, ban you, but the other big way they're doing this on quote free
[39:46.200 --> 39:52.160]  government Internet systems is infowars.com or prismplanet.com are completely banned,
[39:52.160 --> 39:58.240]  but not just us, Paul then noticed that almost every alternative media site, even mainline
[39:58.240 --> 40:04.960]  alternative sites, you see 60% down, 60 plus percent down in newspaper readership, TVs plunging
[40:04.960 --> 40:08.920]  in ratings, the mainstream media is fully discredited, they're falling apart, they've
[40:08.920 --> 40:13.600]  got to do this folks, they are coming, they're chopping up the web right now, you had better
[40:13.600 --> 40:18.760]  use prismplanet.com while it's still available, you'd better tell your whole email list about
[40:18.760 --> 40:23.680]  the censorship, you'd better explain to them the different, we've got to create a war room
[40:23.680 --> 40:29.840]  on prismplanet and infowars now explaining the, well there's really more than 20 ways
[40:29.840 --> 40:37.040]  they're killing the web, but there's six or seven main ways that have subsystems of doing
[40:37.040 --> 40:42.800]  it, so people can identify how they're being censored, how it's being choked, what's happening,
[40:42.800 --> 40:47.720]  but it's here, just like we wrote two years ago, MySpace is a Trojan Horse of Internet
[40:47.720 --> 40:53.440]  2, and that got picked up by a lot of magazines, newspapers, Wired Magazine reported on our
[40:53.440 --> 40:59.280]  report, the San Francisco Chronicle did because their own web people, their own IT specialist,
[40:59.280 --> 41:03.200]  their own consultants had never put the big spectrum together and they went, oh my god,
[41:03.200 --> 41:10.040]  this is accurate, this is real, well we didn't put it together, quit thinking I'm a genius,
[41:10.040 --> 41:16.080]  Internet 2 told us the plan seven years ago, you understand folks, all we do is tell you
[41:16.080 --> 41:23.120]  what their official plan is, Nick Cheney said they wanted terror attacks, staged terror
[41:23.120 --> 41:28.920]  attacks for the war, and then they did it, they are arrogant bastards, it's the same
[41:28.920 --> 41:35.040]  thing on every issue, we're only telling you what is admitted, do you understand that,
[41:35.040 --> 41:38.960]  and if they can acclimate you and get you to accept, okay, they're shutting the web
[41:38.960 --> 41:45.840]  down piece by piece, death by a thousand cuts, and now they're implementing the most egregious
[41:45.840 --> 41:50.360]  forms of censorship and control right now, and if we just accept and go, okay, that's
[41:50.360 --> 41:55.160]  the way it is, I mean we've gone on the web, I checked the message boards, YouTube comments,
[41:55.160 --> 41:58.840]  big comments, we've gone from people saying we're making this up to people saying, okay,
[41:58.840 --> 42:03.840]  Alex Jones is right, but there's nothing we can do about it, we can do a lot about this
[42:03.840 --> 42:09.200]  ladies and gentlemen, Wim Comcast and Time Warner and a few others, but they're together
[42:09.200 --> 42:14.480]  about half of the cable motor market, you can pull the numbers on that in the US and
[42:14.480 --> 42:19.960]  Canada, when they're able to do that, that sets a precedent in all the other majors and
[42:19.960 --> 42:24.920]  then minors can implement that as well, you have to boycott and protest it and speak out
[42:24.920 --> 42:30.880]  against it early on, now is the time.
[42:30.880 --> 42:38.160]  Now I bring you now to Paul Watson, major transportation, major international transportation
[42:38.160 --> 42:45.080]  hubs, censors, political websites, by Paul Watson on PrisonPlanet.com right now, and
[42:45.080 --> 42:52.640]  this is a huge deal, just more of an example of how they all don't just engage in censorship,
[42:52.640 --> 42:58.680]  they then, as he's in the massive international terminal, he's reading newspapers everywhere
[42:58.680 --> 43:03.160]  before he visited Europe for the last week and a half with his girlfriend, it's only
[43:03.160 --> 43:07.320]  article reading China Censors, China does this and that, oh China's so bad they make
[43:07.320 --> 43:11.880]  you sign up for free speech zones, which we already have here, you see we have to recognize
[43:11.880 --> 43:16.360]  we're as bad or worse than China and now they've got congressional hearings talking about shutting
[43:16.360 --> 43:21.480]  down our free speech, we've got all the major pundits calling for my arrest for the things
[43:21.480 --> 43:25.400]  I say, because we're hurting these people, because we do have power because of you the
[43:25.400 --> 43:30.320]  listeners taking action, we're walking point, we need your support, Paul Watson, tell your
[43:30.320 --> 43:32.120]  story, tell folks what happened.
[43:32.120 --> 43:42.080]  Hello Alex, yeah I was traveling down to London from Sheffield to catch the EuroStar,
[43:42.080 --> 43:47.080]  traveling to St. Pancras International, which is basically the home of the EuroStar, it
[43:47.080 --> 43:54.560]  goes to France, Brussels, Germany and beyond and I had actually come down on the train
[43:54.560 --> 44:03.040]  using a 3G connection which is over the cell phone network to collect some articles to
[44:03.040 --> 44:10.120]  post on Prism Planet, so I got the articles bookmarked for them and then when I thought,
[44:10.120 --> 44:15.360]  when I get to St. Pancras they've got a wireless connection which is a lot quicker, so I'll
[44:15.360 --> 44:20.120]  be able to use it to send them to my brother a lot quicker because he'd be updating the
[44:20.120 --> 44:28.160]  website that day, so as soon as I connected to the wireless internet, you know I loaded
[44:28.160 --> 44:36.400]  up a few mainstream websites, BBC, etc, they came up fine, then I tried clicking on a link
[44:36.400 --> 44:47.480]  to thinkprogress.org which is a left-leaning alternative news website but it's semi-mainstream,
[44:47.480 --> 44:54.520]  it's quoted in mainstream sources quite regularly and of course think progress, I mean it covers
[44:54.520 --> 45:02.200]  nothing in relation to UK or UK policy, so to see a message pop up saying, you know this
[45:02.200 --> 45:07.400]  website is blocked and cannot be accessed, I thought, well this is a bit strange, maybe
[45:07.400 --> 45:12.640]  it's some kind of technical error, so then I went straight to prismplanet.com and got
[45:12.640 --> 45:22.120]  exactly the same message, infowars.com, prismplanet.tv, they're all blocked by St. Pancras International
[45:22.120 --> 45:28.360]  as are, you know, others like counterpunch.org and other alternative news websites, they're
[45:28.360 --> 45:34.440]  all blocked and this was around the same time that I was reading headlines in the newspapers
[45:34.440 --> 45:40.880]  about China blocking political websites in anticipation of the Olympic Games, so to just
[45:40.880 --> 45:46.720]  experience the hypocrisy of the fact that it was going on right here at home and the
[45:46.720 --> 45:53.360]  British tabloids and broadsheets were howling about how it was going on in China was just
[45:53.360 --> 46:05.360]  goling to witness. Now Paul, we get reports literally every day of, and I've confirmed
[46:05.360 --> 46:09.920]  many of them, of many other government institutions in the US, Canada, England, Germany, you name
[46:09.920 --> 46:20.120]  it, doing it, we need to desperately, desperately get other media outlets, alternative outlets
[46:20.120 --> 46:23.880]  that have been blocked to report on this. We need to make a big stink out of this. If
[46:23.880 --> 46:26.200]  we lay down to this, this sets a precedent.
[46:26.200 --> 46:34.920]  Well, I mean, I get emails every month from people saying, your website is blocked in
[46:34.920 --> 46:41.040]  a library, in a university, in a hospital. In fact, we've got people in London, it's
[46:41.040 --> 46:47.880]  basically, prismplanet is basically blocked in most, you know, establishment London libraries
[46:47.880 --> 46:53.080]  and many hospitals as well. It's blocked everywhere. No doubt, you know, that's got something
[46:53.080 --> 46:59.200]  to do with the fact that when 777 happened, we were basically right at the forefront of
[46:59.200 --> 47:07.880]  exposing it. But I mean, even to see mildly critical websites in comparison to ours, like
[47:07.880 --> 47:13.920]  think progress get blocked, just underlines how desperate they are to blacklist any kind
[47:13.920 --> 47:18.840]  of alternative information.
[47:18.840 --> 47:26.240]  And Paul, now they are announcing that they are going to do this on entire system-wide
[47:26.240 --> 47:31.080]  grids with major telecommunications companies. We're here, folks. We're now at the point
[47:31.080 --> 47:37.480]  where you won't be able to get to infowars.com and prismplanet.com. Now is the time for people
[47:37.480 --> 47:44.600]  to go absolutely ape and realize how important infowars.com and prismplanet.com are. Ladies
[47:44.600 --> 47:50.120]  and gentlemen, these are precious websites, but not just ours. They are already announced
[47:50.120 --> 47:54.640]  what just a few weeks ago in Canada that 99% of the web will be off limits with their two
[47:54.640 --> 48:01.040]  major telecom companies. This is everybody. This is everything because they can't have
[48:01.040 --> 48:06.520]  infowars.com and prismplanet.com last Thursday. We put the call out to the listeners to make
[48:06.520 --> 48:12.080]  sure the story about Dick Cheney wanting to plan terror attacks out, and then Keith Oberman
[48:12.080 --> 48:16.600]  reported on it and some other publications reported on it. We have the power because
[48:16.600 --> 48:22.360]  the listeners to sabotage their criminal operations. This is life and death, Paul.
[48:22.360 --> 48:29.680]  Well, that's right. I mean, the other way they're getting it through is by censorship
[48:29.680 --> 48:36.720]  of emails during the Downing Street memo scandal, which was of course all over the alternative
[48:36.720 --> 48:44.480]  news media. Yeah, it took the Washington Post weeks or months to even mention it. Comcast
[48:44.480 --> 48:52.440]  was blocking emails with afterdowningstreet.org in the subject heading because they claimed
[48:52.440 --> 49:00.360]  that they had received 46,000 complaints, which is impossible because the activists behind
[49:00.360 --> 49:04.440]  that project, David Swanson, did not send out 46,000 emails.
[49:04.440 --> 49:09.080]  They are moving against us now. Everybody has to stick together. We're all going to
[49:09.080 --> 49:15.480]  hang separate on this. They are moving against us because we're on the verge of exposing
[49:15.480 --> 49:21.000]  their state-sponsored terrorism, their fake global warming hype, their global taxes,
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.840]  all of it. Ladies and gentlemen, it's happening now. Paul, what's the battle plan? What should
[49:26.840 --> 49:32.160]  we do? What should we ask listeners to do? Well, what's proven successful in the past
[49:32.160 --> 49:38.040]  is whenever something like this happened, I mean, my space admitted to the fact that
[49:38.040 --> 49:42.080]  we were on a censorship list that first they said it was a technical error, then later
[49:42.080 --> 49:47.960]  when it happened again, we got a screenshot of one of the administrators admitting that
[49:47.960 --> 49:52.840]  prisonplanet.com links were being censored because the website was on a blacklist.
[49:52.840 --> 49:58.280]  And you need to make a master article with the 30 or 40, probably more examples we have
[49:58.280 --> 50:02.960]  where censorship of our sites is admitted. And I'm so tired of listeners on our MySpace
[50:02.960 --> 50:08.840]  account saying that we're blocking your posts, we're blocking your videos. No, MySpace does
[50:08.840 --> 50:15.120]  that to everybody. Dig, rigged us and admitted that we were rigged to where we couldn't get
[50:15.120 --> 50:18.720]  onto the main page. I mean, we're being hit by every angle. And then the listeners think
[50:18.720 --> 50:24.720]  we're doing it. We're not doing it. Well, Alex, I mean, you could go, if you go to
[50:24.720 --> 50:31.560]  Alex Jones' MySpace page right now and click on the blog, then try and click on the link
[50:31.560 --> 50:36.240]  for the latest entry, which is this article that we're talking about now, because I post
[50:36.240 --> 50:40.280]  the first paragraph and then I post a link to the rest of the article, which is a link
[50:40.280 --> 50:45.560]  to prisonplanet.com. Go and click on the link. It will not send you to prisonplanet.com.
[50:45.560 --> 50:50.440]  It will send you to MySpace homepage because they've blocked the link. Yeah, they don't
[50:50.440 --> 50:55.360]  let us send bulletins out. I've got a way to counter them when we get back. Stay with
[50:55.360 --> 51:01.520]  us, ladies and gentlemen. Paul Watson, stay there. We'll be right back.
[51:01.520 --> 51:06.560]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels

[52:04.840 --> 52:09.760]  of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought
[52:09.760 --> 52:14.800]  we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a
[52:14.800 --> 52:23.760]  platform to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the AT made a statement that the
[52:23.760 --> 52:29.600]  air was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave
[52:29.600 --> 52:34.360]  souls throughout the world take action against their global masters. He had his hand over
[52:34.360 --> 52:39.360]  the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1
[52:39.360 --> 52:45.920]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[52:45.920 --> 52:51.760]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order
[52:51.760 --> 52:57.080]  the DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose the government sponsored terror, they're going
[52:57.080 --> 53:04.520]  to commit more acts and bring in martial law. Question, is the world getting better or vastly
[53:04.520 --> 53:13.760]  worse? A world economic collapse could come any day. Question, are you prepared or are

[54:25.800 --> 54:32.600]  There's one big thing you can do. Go get our major headlines, the most important news we
[54:32.600 --> 54:38.240]  put out of day. Probably 3-4 articles we write on the biggest, most important issues. Earth
[54:38.240 --> 54:43.160]  shaking stuff like Dick Cheney planned to attack 12 different targets including dressing
[54:43.160 --> 54:48.320]  up Navy SEALs and putting them on patrol boats and having them attack US ships blaming it
[54:48.320 --> 54:53.800]  on Iran. You, the listeners, are the ones being censored. You got that out. That's why they're
[54:53.800 --> 54:59.480]  scared of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com because millions of you together on these
[54:59.480 --> 55:03.920]  sites are able to break through the electronic Berlin Wall that is the control corporate
[55:03.920 --> 55:12.680]  media. We are kicking their butts right now. You've got to go get stories like Rest in
[55:12.680 --> 55:19.000]  Peace, Alexander Sheldon Edson, Neocons Pressured, Epiata Blame, Alcatra for Anthrax Attacks,
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.600]  Fisher International Transportation Hub, Sensors Political Websites. Those are the headlines
[55:23.600 --> 55:28.840]  on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com. Don't take this information for granted. Put it
[55:28.840 --> 55:33.960]  on hundreds of websites. Go on message boards, post it in full. That's why we're trying
[55:33.960 --> 55:40.960]  to hire more staff so we can post our full articles on MySpace so they can't censor that.
[55:40.960 --> 55:45.320]  At least that will be on the page. They're blocking our videos. YouTube, we know, is
[55:45.320 --> 55:50.800]  messing with the counters. We know that Google would change our hits or when we were getting
[55:50.800 --> 55:54.560]  a video that might be having a half million hits a day, they would just block it for a
[55:54.560 --> 56:00.760]  few weeks or erase it and then they stop putting the counters on Google video, started knocking
[56:00.760 --> 56:05.760]  us out of the number one spot. We're winning the InfoWars and they're cheating. Of course
[56:05.760 --> 56:11.720]  they're cheating. They want tyranny. They want dehumanization. Folks, we need your help.
[56:11.720 --> 56:16.920]  We need InfoWars, not orders from headquarters, but to every day. For 30 minutes, all of you
[56:16.920 --> 56:21.840]  who are computer savvy, go in there, copy our stories, post them everywhere, post them.
[56:21.840 --> 56:26.300]  If every listener out there who's on the website will just start copying our stories, emailing
[56:26.300 --> 56:29.800]  them out to everybody, posting them on sites, we have to let the New World Order know we're
[56:29.800 --> 56:36.000]  not going to put up with this and let everybody know. PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net,
[56:36.000 --> 56:42.000]  JonesReport.com, these sites are scaring the globalists to death. They are shutting us
[56:42.000 --> 56:47.640]  down. They are censoring us everywhere. Appreciate our Google videos. Appreciate the YouTube videos.
[56:47.640 --> 56:51.880]  They're not going to be there forever, folks, if they're able to win. They're moving now.
[56:51.880 --> 56:57.320]  We better get the word out while we've still got some punch. You understand, Paul Watson?
[56:57.320 --> 57:03.080]  Any other ideas? I guess complain to these ISPs, cancel your service if they don't unblock
[57:03.080 --> 57:07.320]  it. I mean, every one of you, you can't count. Look, you can forget Congress. You can forget
[57:07.320 --> 57:10.960]  the executive. It's all bought and paid for. We've got to take the country and the world
[57:10.960 --> 57:14.480]  back at the grassroots. They're moving to block us, and they're moving to block us because
[57:14.480 --> 57:16.960]  we are having an effect. Paul Watson.
[57:16.960 --> 57:22.440]  Well, yeah, it's been successful in the past when Google blocked Space War, which is the
[57:22.440 --> 57:30.840]  mainstream website that carries AFP articles. Some of the mildly critical of China's geopolitical
[57:30.840 --> 57:36.720]  aspirations, Google simply delisted that website from their entire search engine. There was
[57:36.720 --> 57:39.720]  an outcry, and it came back a couple of days later.
[57:39.720 --> 57:47.480]  Let's be clear, Paul. I'm going to hold you over. Let's be clear. YouTube, Google, Yahoo,
[57:47.480 --> 57:52.920]  they all admit for three years they are censoring for Communist China. They get the list from
[57:52.920 --> 57:58.440]  them and do what they say. You understand. Now they're doing it on a mass scale in the
[57:58.440 --> 58:03.120]  U.S., England, Canada, and Europe. Are we going to put up with Communist Chinese style
[58:03.120 --> 58:08.120]  or worse censorship of the sites? It's happening. Do you understand?
[58:08.120 --> 58:15.320]  That's the point, Alex, because, as you said, I was in China. There's a delay every time
[58:15.320 --> 58:21.120]  you visit a website while it's checked against the government blacklist, and Prismplanet.com
[58:21.120 --> 58:25.360]  isn't on that blacklist, but it is in London, England.
[58:25.360 --> 58:31.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, the government of Britannia, the criminal organization is blocking all
[58:31.520 --> 58:36.800]  of our websites, and many others. We'll be right back to keep breaking this down with
[58:36.800 --> 58:42.720]  Paul Watson. Stay with us.
[58:42.720 --> 58:51.520]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:51.520 --> 58:58.640]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by
[58:58.640 --> 59:02.560]  a powerful world government. It's known as the Builder Bird.
[59:02.560 --> 59:09.480]  Is that their objective being world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:09.480 --> 59:15.400]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[59:15.400 --> 59:21.960]  of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's
[59:21.960 --> 59:26.960]  plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the
[59:26.960 --> 59:30.600]  entire new world order agenda. The Builder Bird is making great progress
[59:30.600 --> 59:33.320]  toward a world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after
[59:33.320 --> 59:37.200]  money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their aptitude.

[59:43.600 --> 59:48.600]  at prismplanet.tv. In-game, blueprint for global enslaved.
[59:48.600 --> 59:53.600]  You have been warned.
[59:53.600 --> 1:00:05.600]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.600 --> 1:00:10.320]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:17.640]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:26.680]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:26.680 --> 1:00:34.760]  I have an idea. A great way to counter this.
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:41.240]  We need folks like the Alex Jones channel and other independent gatekeeper invasion.
[1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:44.040]  Enough for respect. All those great YouTube channels.
[1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:47.520]  We need you to take what I'm about to say just a minute or two and then edit it together
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:53.280]  with the last 30-minute rant down to about a 10-minute piece to explain this to everybody.
[1:00:53.280 --> 1:01:01.000]  Here's what we do to counter the British government censoring prismplanet.com and infowars.com.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  We use YouTube as a weapon. And no doubt they will censor our hit counters as well.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:15.840]  But we do this as another example for everybody. And you take this video and you send it out
[1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:21.000]  to everybody you know, you pass it on to everyone, and then we show everyone the censorship
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:26.480]  that's going on, not just on Myspace, not just with the government filters now on websites,
[1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:30.280]  all the things that are admitted and documented, worse than Communist China.
[1:01:30.280 --> 1:01:36.080]  You then will witness YouTube, if it follows past operations, when this viral video hits
[1:01:36.080 --> 1:01:41.960]  about 200,000 and we've had videos that have done that in one day on YouTube and then suddenly
[1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:45.720]  the counter just stops and adds a couple hundred a day. I mean, you'll have a video
[1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:52.440]  with 300,000 views and it'll have 20,000 comments. That's impossible. Or you'll have 40-something
[1:01:52.440 --> 1:01:58.480]  thousand ratings and only 200,000 views. That ratio is not right. But we caught Google
[1:01:58.480 --> 1:02:04.160]  censoring us, both in text, and they've had to admit it, and with videos. We've had a
[1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:07.400]  whole bunch of videos that were number one. Not anymore. They just took the hit counters
[1:02:07.400 --> 1:02:14.560]  off Google video. We need you to make a serious stink about this and get this out to everyone
[1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:20.240]  to then illustrate the censorship they're engaging in. Google and YouTube, which of course YouTube
[1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:26.280]  is owned by Google, Yahoo and others admittedly for close to three years, have been censoring
[1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:31.240]  things for the communist Chinese government. Now, they're using those same censor systems
[1:02:31.240 --> 1:02:36.400]  here in the United States, in Canada, in England, and there's a whole cocktail of other ways
[1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:41.480]  they're censoring. But again, the British government is censoring right now. They are
[1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:46.040]  censoring PrisonPlanet.com and our other family of websites because we're so effective.
[1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:50.120]  We pushed it out. Our listeners pushed it out. Got Keith Overman to cover last week.
[1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:53.800]  The fact that Cheney was planning stage terror attacks and killing our own troops. This is
[1:02:53.800 --> 1:02:58.640]  important news. We're risking our lives. And for our safety, we need to continue to be
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:03.200]  prominent and more prominent. They're bringing in tyranny, ladies and gentlemen. The mainstream
[1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:07.600]  media is dying. They're panicking. The propaganda arms are losing all their credibility. So
[1:03:07.600 --> 1:03:12.240]  now they're engaging in communist Chinese style or welly and censorship. Paul Watson,
[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:14.520]  we need everybody to get this video out.
[1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:23.360]  Yeah, and there's another thing, Alex, concerning Google. Now, this may be related to the fact
[1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:30.080]  that we changed our website design, but it's happening with old articles that were under
[1:03:30.080 --> 1:03:37.760]  the old design. And that is, when you search for an article from PrisonPlanet.com in Google,
[1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:42.720]  if you search for any other article, you'll get the headline of the page and the keywords
[1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:47.920]  or the first paragraph of the page underneath in your Google search. Now, when you search
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:53.240]  for a PrisonPlanet article, all you get is the headline. You don't get any keywords,
[1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:58.960]  thereby relegating the link further down the Google results page. Now, as I said, it's
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:04.680]  happening on articles that were in the old format. So, I've got no explanation as to
[1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:09.840]  why that's happening, but it's certainly resulting in making PrisonPlanet.com articles
[1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:13.800]  harder to find on Google.
[1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:18.760]  That's why we need listeners to take our stories, and if you even change the headline
[1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:23.000]  yourself sometimes to confuse their system and their blocks, but we have the British
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:28.680]  government admitting they are censoring universities, city libraries, governments, but it's not
[1:04:28.680 --> 1:04:34.240]  just us. It's thousands of other alternative sites. We are just some of the most banned
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:38.800]  out there. Paul Watson, I want to come back, open the phones up for listeners, their ideas
[1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:44.040]  of ways to counter this. We need your help. We're being shut down, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:49.800]  We're being shut down because our information warfare system is going viral, and they are
[1:04:49.800 --> 1:04:54.120]  shutting us down. If you can look at PrisonPlanet numbers, they're cratering. Are you going
[1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:58.800]  to let them win, ladies and gentlemen? Are you going to let them shut us down worldwide?
[1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:00.800]  Are we going to be like Communist China?
[1:05:00.800 --> 1:05:05.800]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:11.500]  Out there. Paul Watson, I want to come back, open the phones up for listeners, their ideas
[1:05:11.500 --> 1:05:16.720]  of ways to counter this. We need your help. We're being shut down, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:22.520]  We're being shut down because our information warfare system is going viral, and they are
[1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:26.840]  shutting us down. If you can look at PrisonPlanet numbers, they're cratering. Are you going
[1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:31.600]  to let them win, ladies and gentlemen? Are you going to let them shut us down worldwide?
[1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:33.240]  Are we going to be like Communist China?
[1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:38.240]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:41.240]  9-Eleven was an inside job.
[1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:44.240]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:47.240]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage?
[1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:51.240]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.?
[1:05:53.240 --> 1:06:00.240]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:06:00.240 --> 1:06:05.240]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:10.240]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:06:13.240 --> 1:06:16.240]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:06:16.240 --> 1:06:19.240]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:06:19.240 --> 1:06:25.240]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:30.240]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:33.240]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:38.240]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:45.240]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.

[1:06:54.240 --> 1:07:02.240]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival and emergency food rations.

[1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:16.240]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:23.240]  People spend money on all kinds of things but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:33.240]  So don't delay, call today 908-6912608 and see what our powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:36.240]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:40.240]  Matthew 24 states four times, in the last days many will be deceived.
[1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:44.240]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[1:07:44.240 --> 1:07:48.240]  What do you know about the beast? It's Mark and the Antichrist.
[1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:52.240]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[1:07:52.240 --> 1:07:57.240]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the national ID card or 666?
[1:07:57.240 --> 1:08:00.240]  Is the Antichrist a person, title or both?
[1:08:00.240 --> 1:08:04.240]  Some believe these things are in the future, others believe that it's in the past.
[1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:07.240]  First John states the Antichrist is already in the world.
[1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:12.240]  What is the truth and what is a lie? Are you willing to search God's word for the truth?
[1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:20.240]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible for free books, DVDs and Bible studies exposing the Antichrist, the beast and its mark right to the Bible.
[1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:25.240]  Alex Jones.
[1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:34.240]  Psychologically, Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo, myself, the folks that run info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and allied websites,
[1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:42.240]  we have become acclimated to being censored by Google and YouTube and MySpace.
[1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:44.240]  And they've all been caught, they've all admitted it.
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:46.240]  We've written major news articles on it.
[1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:48.240]  Mainstream news is picked up on our censorship.
[1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:52.240]  Now the British government is blocking us out on their wireless networks.
[1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:56.240]  This is confirmed, universities, libraries, this is happening.
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:08:59.240]  We need everybody to get this information out to everyone.
[1:08:59.240 --> 1:09:01.240]  In fact, I need listeners. I'm going to do this right now.
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:05.240]  I was given a large donation a few weeks ago.
[1:09:05.240 --> 1:09:07.240]  I've been so busy I hadn't figured out how to use it.
[1:09:07.240 --> 1:09:09.240]  I knew I was going to do some contest.
[1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:12.240]  $5,000.
[1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:14.240]  And we don't have time to wait on this.
[1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:16.240]  You need to get on making the video right now.
[1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:20.240]  $5,000 prize for whoever makes.
[1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:23.240]  It can be 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 2 minutes long.
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:25.240]  I don't care. It just needs to be under 10 minutes.
[1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:28.240]  The best video.
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:31.240]  And I want it to be on YouTube in one of their formats.
[1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:38.240]  He's been on two formats, YouTube, one of the other channels.
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:41.240]  $5,000 for the person.
[1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:46.240]  And we're just going to go ahead and set this date for,
[1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:50.240]  we'll go ahead and set it for the 19th.
[1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:53.240]  What is that, a Thursday or is that a Wednesday coming up this month?
[1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:56.240]  The 19th, $5,000.
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:10:00.240]  I've had three or four other contests over the years.
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:02.240]  We will send you a checkout.
[1:10:02.240 --> 1:10:07.240]  All of the entries will be posted on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com today.
[1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:13.240]  We're going to get the information up on the websites.
[1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:22.240]  We're going to go ahead and create a section for the contest.
[1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:24.240]  $5,000.
[1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:29.240]  $1,000 goes to second place, $500 for third place.
[1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:34.240]  That's $6,500 in prizes on that.
[1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:37.240]  The individual that gave me the donations has spent it however I wanted.
[1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:40.240]  I said I'm going to spend it on contest.
[1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:47.240]  We're going to have another contest for $1,000 for the best trailer
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:52.240]  using clips from the film Truth Rising.
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:57.240]  Okay, so that's $7,500 in prizes.
[1:10:57.240 --> 1:11:04.240]  We're also going to have $2,000 prize for a new Declaration of Independence
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:08.240]  listing the crimes of this government.
[1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:12.240]  It needs to be a three, four page essay.
[1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:15.240]  I need to come up with a number of words roughly,
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:22.240]  but $2,000 for the best new Declaration of Independence.
[1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:24.240]  There will be another.
[1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:27.240]  Now that's up to $9,000.
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:32.240]  There will be a $1,000 prize, literary prize, but the real prize is
[1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:34.240]  it's going to go all over the websites.
[1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:35.240]  We're going to push it.
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:36.240]  It's going to be big.
[1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:41.240]  A bill of particulars, a listing.
[1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:42.240]  It could be 10 pages.
[1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:43.240]  It could be 100 pages.
[1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:47.240]  Long listing all the crimes and evidence of chemical, biological testing,
[1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:52.240]  killing the American people, others, CPS stealing children, police brutality,
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:59.240]  the wars listing all the crimes of the New World Order.
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:02.240]  That's like $10,000 in prizes.
[1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:03.240]  Okay, I keep waiting.
[1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:04.240]  I wanted to write these up.
[1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:06.240]  I'm just launching it now.
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:13.240]  Okay, the 19th is the deadline, the 19th of August.
[1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:17.240]  That gives you like 15 days, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:18.240]  Don't wait.
[1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:19.240]  Make the videos now.
[1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:21.240]  Write the essays now.
[1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:27.240]  We will create an email, several emails for the contest, a page, a comment section,
[1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:31.240]  a message board, and then of course hundreds of videos will be made with each contest.
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:36.240]  That will reach tens of millions.
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:39.240]  Millions will end up in the aggregate reading, the new Declaration of Independence,
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:43.240]  and another contest, the bill of particulars.
[1:12:43.240 --> 1:12:51.240]  That's what they had for the, well, from really 1760 into 1775 was they had little hand bills,
[1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:55.240]  little newsletters, so they were censored then, listing the crimes of the government,
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:57.240]  listing the abuses.
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:12:59.240]  So there you go, a bunch of different.
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:01.240]  I've been meaning to launch that.
[1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:03.240]  I'm launching it now, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:06.240]  Thanks to a great guy, Darrell, who Darrell, I got your call yesterday.
[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:08.240]  I'm going to be calling you, who gave us the donation to do that.
[1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:10.240]  There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:12.240]  That's how we're going to counter this.
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:18.240]  But I need you now, and you got great minds.
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:20.240]  You're great editors.
[1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:23.240]  We'll post them all on the website now.
[1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:25.240]  I need you to not wait.
[1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:27.240]  We're going to have, I'm going to go to $11,000.
[1:13:27.240 --> 1:13:35.240]  A $1,000 prize for whoever by Friday makes the best video,
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:41.240]  and that will be chosen by, I'll tell you Monday who the winner is on this $1,000 prize.
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:44.240]  You know what, let's make it $2,000.
[1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:49.240]  No, no, no, $3,000 prize for next Monday.
[1:13:49.240 --> 1:13:54.240]  It's got to be on the web by Friday, and you know who wins the $3,000 prize
[1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:56.240]  to defeat tyranny and censorship?
[1:13:56.240 --> 1:14:00.240]  Whoever gets the most hits on YouTube with a video about this censorship
[1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:04.240]  editing together the last 45 minutes down to 10 minutes.
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:05.240]  It could be 5 minutes.
[1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:12.240]  Whoever edits the best video down that gets the most hits as of Monday morning.
[1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:14.240]  Okay?
[1:14:14.240 --> 1:14:16.240]  You will get $3,000.
[1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:19.240]  And I'm going to be searching YouTube and seeing what's gotten the most hits.
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:27.240]  But we'll call that the censorship, the censorship contest.
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:29.240]  And then you'll need to email those.
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:31.240]  We'll have email addresses up for you in the next day.
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:41.240]  So now we've got, what is it, four or five contests of over $11,000 coming up for the 19th,
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:51.240]  but $3,000, $3,000 for whatever's most viral and whatever's had the most views as of Monday.
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:54.240]  And that can be on any platform, but I recommend YouTube.
[1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:56.240]  Paul Watson, I'm thinking on my feet here.
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:14:58.240]  What do you think of the plan?
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:02.240]  I think it's a good way to get people motivated.
[1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:09.240]  Certainly, this is one of the most important subjects at present because they still consider
[1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:14.240]  the internet to be somewhat out of their control and they want to centralize control of it.
[1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:16.240]  That's one of the main agendas.
[1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:18.240]  And why do we need the web?
[1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:21.240]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, why do they have to shut it down and restrict it?
[1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:26.240]  Because the New York cops can run 15 feet and knock a bicycler off and bust their head open
[1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:29.240]  and then charge that person with assaulting the police.
[1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:33.240]  And then it gets shown that the cop went and tackled him and then the cop gets in trouble.
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:37.240]  Or the police, some guys walking outside out of a convenience store with a glass of ice,
[1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:39.240]  no alcohol, they say, come here, he doesn't.
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:42.240]  So they beat him with a baton, bloody.
[1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.240]  That comes out, they get in trouble.
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:46.240]  All this is hurting the New World Order.
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:48.240]  It's come to a flash point.
[1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:53.240]  They thought they'd use the web as the worldwide wiretap as DARPA called it 25 years ago as the joke.
[1:15:53.240 --> 1:15:57.240]  But we've used it as a web to capture them and expose them.
[1:15:57.240 --> 1:15:59.240]  They dug a pit for us and they've fallen into it.
[1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:01.240]  They want to shut it down and go to a controlled web.
[1:16:01.240 --> 1:16:02.240]  Paul, I'm really fired up.
[1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:04.240]  I want to go to some calls here in a moment for you.
[1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:07.240]  But right now, any other points you've got?
[1:16:07.240 --> 1:16:15.240]  Yeah, people like Bill Gates have proposed people having to buy credits to send emails
[1:16:15.240 --> 1:16:18.240]  where each email would cost you, say, a penny to send,
[1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:22.240]  which of course would be in the death knell for political mailing lists.
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:28.240]  And then there's a quote from BT, which is British Telecom.
[1:16:28.240 --> 1:16:35.240]  BT's Graham Whitehead, who said that the anarchic and hazardous nature of the public internet
[1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:39.240]  meant that companies are now constructing supervised private IP networks.
[1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:40.240]  And this was years ago.
[1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:42.240]  Quote, the internet is dead or dying.
[1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:44.240]  It's full of viruses, worms and porn.
[1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:47.240]  You have to wear a Kevlar suit before you go online.
[1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:51.240]  BT is creating a private network which will be joined to other private networks.
[1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:55.240]  And this is internet too, which has been around for at least six to seven years.
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:17:00.240]  Meanwhile, it's the big networks, most of them, that are in the business of porn through subsidiaries
[1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:01.240]  making the money.
[1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:07.240]  And then they don't censor the porn, they censor us and all of you tomorrow.
[1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:11.240]  Go ahead, Watson.
[1:17:11.240 --> 1:17:19.240]  That's the future is a website on a government subdomain where you have to get a registration just to exist.
[1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:26.240]  And of course, you'll get the DVD downloads in seconds and the high resolution teleconferencing facilities
[1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:30.240]  which universities and corporations already have access to and are using.
[1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:33.240]  But they use tax money to build in the last seven years.
[1:17:33.240 --> 1:17:39.240]  Yeah, on the fiber optic network, but you won't have access to prismplanet.com.
[1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:45.240]  Paul Watson, I need you to go listen to the announcement I just made about these contests.
[1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:51.240]  I had a huge article out on that listing why we're doing and how it's the counter censorship.
[1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:57.240]  I mean, I don't know, I think that's like $14,000 or more in prizes, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:17:57.240 --> 1:18:01.240]  to be paid out in the next 15 days, 3,000 of it on Monday.
[1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:07.240]  You're going to get mail to check Monday, whoever creates a video about this censorship that goes the most viral.
[1:18:07.240 --> 1:18:10.240]  It is up to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:13.240]  I mean, if we don't have the web, folks, we don't have anything.
[1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:16.240]  Paul, I can't believe they're doing this, but I can.
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:18.240]  I mean, we're kicking their butt.
[1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:21.240]  Well, that's right. I mean, they're moving forward.
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:28.240]  They know that the Internet is the last outpost of freedom of speech and we're using it to its full effect.
[1:18:28.240 --> 1:18:32.240]  So they've announced, you know, they've declared war on it.
[1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:37.240]  The White House has the Think.com house and now we're being censored by the British government as well.
[1:18:37.240 --> 1:18:38.240]  See, there's so many facets.
[1:18:38.240 --> 1:18:43.240]  It's CENTcom announced what two years ago they were going to put thousands of fake bloggers out and corporate bloggers.
[1:18:43.240 --> 1:18:48.240]  They already have huge PR firms writing the stories for the major newspapers in Iraq in the U.S.
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:50.240]  They're writing them. They're now doing that against us.
[1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:53.240]  These guys are death-threading us all over the message boards with their handles.
[1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:56.240]  It goes back to their websites and their CENTcom and other military goons.
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:18:58.240]  My God, it's just incredible.
[1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:00.240]  The level of attack we're under, Paul.
[1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:02.240]  Will the listeners come to our aid?
[1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:05.240]  We are the champions on the front line for you.
[1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:12.240]  That's right. It's the battleground and we need as many troops in the cyber warfare as possible.
[1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:17.240]  Folks, we can completely kick their ass if you will just take action and stop screwing around
[1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:22.240]  and face down the New World Order and get aggressive and dedicate yourself to making videos
[1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:26.240]  and posting stories and getting information out about web censorship.
[1:19:26.240 --> 1:19:29.240]  And we're going to start writing articles every day about this.
[1:19:29.240 --> 1:19:30.240]  We're trying to move into a bigger office.
[1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:31.240]  We're trying to hire more people.
[1:19:31.240 --> 1:19:33.240]  We're fighting as hard as we can.
[1:19:33.240 --> 1:19:35.240]  We need your help right now.
[1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:37.240]  The enemy's knocking down the wall at the gates.
[1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:39.240]  We've got to block them at the breach.
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:41.240]  This is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:44.240]  I need you to not wait any time.
[1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:47.240]  Now, we're going to be uploading the video of this to PrisonPlanet.TV.
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:48.240]  You can grab it from there.
[1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:52.240]  In fact, I'm going to take this last hour rant
[1:19:52.240 --> 1:19:57.240]  and I'm going to post it free on the Internet this afternoon, okay?
[1:19:57.240 --> 1:19:59.240]  This is going up free.
[1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:00.240]  I've got to pay for it.
[1:20:00.240 --> 1:20:02.240]  It'll cost me thousands of dollars.
[1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:04.240]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:20:04.240 --> 1:20:08.240]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[1:20:08.240 --> 1:20:10.240]  won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[1:20:10.240 --> 1:20:11.240]  That's right.
[1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:14.240]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[1:20:14.240 --> 1:20:18.240]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize
[1:20:18.240 --> 1:20:21.240]  the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[1:20:21.240 --> 1:20:25.240]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments
[1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:29.240]  like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[1:20:29.240 --> 1:20:32.240]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control
[1:20:32.240 --> 1:20:34.240]  of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:37.240]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement,
[1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:40.240]  call 800-686-2237.
[1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:43.240]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation
[1:20:43.240 --> 1:20:45.240]  and low return on your paper investments.
[1:20:45.240 --> 1:20:48.240]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:50.240]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[1:20:50.240 --> 1:20:54.240]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:20:54.240 --> 1:20:59.240]  That's 1800-686-2237.

[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:47.240]  of harmful acidic waste with alkaline ionized water.

[1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:29.240]  Elite.
[1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:31.240]  Proponents of the New World Order.
[1:23:31.240 --> 1:23:34.240]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:37.240]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:39.240]  Everything they have built over the centuries,
[1:23:39.240 --> 1:23:41.240]  the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:43.240]  the power they have established,
[1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:45.240]  the poisoning of the masses,
[1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:47.240]  the destruction of the earth and mankind,
[1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:49.240]  we will undo through the authority
[1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:51.240]  that has now been delegated to us.

[1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:01.240]  The message of His Kingdom.
[1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:04.240]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:24:04.240 --> 1:24:28.240]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:24:28.240 --> 1:24:29.240]  Jaja in New York.
[1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:30.240]  You're on the air with Paul Watson.
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:32.240]  Go ahead.
[1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:33.240]  What's up, Alex?
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:34.240]  I'm a new fan.
[1:24:34.240 --> 1:24:35.240]  I love you to death.
[1:24:35.240 --> 1:24:38.240]  You know, I found you out by freak accident.
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:40.240]  One of my fans sent me to you
[1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:42.240]  because I've been fighting with this.
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:44.240]  My late cousin is Aaron Russo, actually.
[1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:46.240]  We were very tight.
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:47.240]  You're a hip-hop artist.
[1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:48.240]  A blonde.
[1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:49.240]  I've seen you.
[1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:50.240]  I'm a rapper.
[1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:51.240]  That's right.
[1:24:51.240 --> 1:24:52.240]  I'm also a visual artist.
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:53.240]  You know, very well-known.
[1:24:53.240 --> 1:24:55.240]  I stuff in the Whitney Museum
[1:24:55.240 --> 1:24:58.240]  and I chose all over the world internationally.
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:00.240]  You know, I was targeted.
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:01.240]  And this is why I came.
[1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:03.240]  I always knew, from day one,
[1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:06.240]  I knew that the World Trade Center
[1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:09.240]  was set up with an inside job
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:12.240]  because I, right across the Twin Towers,
[1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:14.240]  I used to live right in Brooklyn,
[1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:17.240]  and in 910, I had helicopters out my window
[1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:20.240]  all that night, and I was printing photographs.
[1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:22.240]  I was printing mosh pits in my dark room.
[1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:25.240]  I was getting military helicopters
[1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:27.240]  overriding my punk rock music,
[1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:30.240]  blaring light into my dark room by my loft.
[1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:32.240]  I was right by the kind of plant
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:34.240]  that we couldn't even think all that night.
[1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:35.240]  I walked on the streets.
[1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:36.240]  Everybody was like,
[1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:37.240]  where's the criminal?
[1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:38.240]  Where's the criminal?
[1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:39.240]  There's military helicopters.
[1:25:39.240 --> 1:25:40.240]  Well, I've got to have you on as a guest
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:41.240]  sometime.
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:42.240]  I'm aware of your work.
[1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:43.240]  What's your take on all this censorship?
[1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:44.240]  Oh, this is...
[1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:45.240]  I am so angry.
[1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:46.240]  You don't understand.
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:48.240]  I just sent a bulletin out of my face.
[1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:50.240]  I am so angry about this.
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:51.240]  I am...
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:52.240]  I am...
[1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:53.240]  You don't understand.
[1:25:53.240 --> 1:25:55.240]  Like, the fact that I'm a freedom fighter,
[1:25:55.240 --> 1:25:57.240]  you know, I'm a freedom-for-speech fighter,
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:25:59.240]  and the fact that they're going into the UK,
[1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:00.240]  and his mother...
[1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:02.240]  This country that we ran from...
[1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:05.240]  Oh, my God, that's the first step for them
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:08.240]  to really get at us.
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:09.240]  And it's scary.
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:11.240]  And I'm going to do everything that I can for you, Alex.
[1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:12.240]  I'm going to blast it.
[1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:14.240]  I'm going to blare it all over my space.
[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:15.240]  And they've already taken me down once.
[1:26:15.240 --> 1:26:17.240]  I was in the top 10 for a year and a half.
[1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:19.240]  I had a million and a half hits,
[1:26:19.240 --> 1:26:20.240]  and they couldn't stare me.
[1:26:20.240 --> 1:26:22.240]  And they've been stealing from me.
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:24.240]  They've been stealing all my music,
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:26.240]  all these people in the big corporations.
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:28.240]  Then they access my computer.
[1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:30.240]  Okay, if you know that Aaron,
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:31.240]  they Y-attacked him.
[1:26:31.240 --> 1:26:32.240]  They Y-attacked my whole family.
[1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:34.240]  Now, they came out in the New York Times.
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:36.240]  Well, listen, let me get your info, your phone number.
[1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:38.240]  I'd like to have you on as a guest sometime,
[1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:39.240]  because I recognize your voice.
[1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:40.240]  I've seen some of your videos,
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:42.240]  and we really appreciate you calling Jaja.
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:44.240]  Okay, we're going to get your number right now.
[1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:45.240]  All right, you got it.
[1:26:45.240 --> 1:26:46.240]  John, go ahead and get that.
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:48.240]  Look, they can't stop us
[1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:50.240]  if more people like her line up.
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:52.240]  I need the great lady who's at the Ron Paul event,
[1:26:52.240 --> 1:26:54.240]  who was on with Burmese when I was out of town.
[1:26:54.240 --> 1:26:55.240]  She said she's a big fan of the show,
[1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:56.240]  and then I woke her up.
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:26:58.240]  I didn't know that we need her to help us.
[1:26:58.240 --> 1:26:59.240]  We need everybody to help us,
[1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:00.240]  because we're under attack.
[1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:02.240]  Paul Watson?
[1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:03.240]  That's right, Alex,
[1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:04.240]  and there's a lot of...
[1:27:04.240 --> 1:27:07.240]  There's a groundswell of hip-hop artists
[1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:09.240]  over the past five or six years,
[1:27:09.240 --> 1:27:12.240]  but they're not going to get on MTV, are they?
[1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:14.240]  Because that's another form of censorship.
[1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:17.240]  They pick the music that conforms
[1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:20.240]  to the message of keeping the culture down
[1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:23.240]  as it is at the moment, obsessed with sex and money.
[1:27:23.240 --> 1:27:26.240]  Whereas the groundswell of an awakening
[1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:29.240]  that is happening in the background is depressed.
[1:27:29.240 --> 1:27:32.240]  Well, folks, we're going to have a big prize
[1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:35.240]  coming up the 19th for whoever has the best video
[1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:38.240]  promoting PrismPlanet.com and InfoWords.com
[1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:40.240]  and to stop censorship, but we can't wait.
[1:27:40.240 --> 1:27:43.240]  That's 15 days away.
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:45.240]  You've got till Sunday, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:47.240]  $3,000 to have won.
[1:27:47.240 --> 1:27:49.240]  The winner will be whatever has the most hits.
[1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:52.240]  It'll be the same thing with
[1:27:52.240 --> 1:27:54.240]  what happens with the 19th,
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:56.240]  but again, it can't be whatever video wins
[1:27:56.240 --> 1:27:58.240]  coming up Sunday,
[1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:00.240]  because that may be the biggest video
[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:02.240]  of the end 15 days from now.
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:04.240]  So pick which one you want to get involved in.
[1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:06.240]  Get all of this out to everybody right now.
[1:28:06.240 --> 1:28:08.240]  This is so important.
[1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:10.240]  Let's jam in on some more calls.
[1:28:10.240 --> 1:28:12.240]  Matt in the U.K., where the British government
[1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:14.240]  is censoring PrismPlanet.com. Go ahead.
[1:28:14.240 --> 1:28:16.240]  Good morning. I'll go after you, Alex.
[1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:18.240]  Thanks for inviting me on the show.
[1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:19.240]  Welcome.
[1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:21.240]  It's not to mention, yeah,
[1:28:21.240 --> 1:28:23.240]  obviously about censorship
[1:28:23.240 --> 1:28:25.240]  and obviously accessing info wars
[1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:27.240]  and PrismPlanet.com as well.
[1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:29.240]  I've found it pretty hard
[1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:31.240]  to even access your site on info wars.
[1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:32.240]  Can you turn your radio off,
[1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:34.240]  because I want to hear what you have to say.
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:36.240]  Yeah, of course. One minute.
[1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:37.240]  Sorry about that.
[1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:38.240]  Yeah, I was mentioning that, look there,
[1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:39.240]  but obviously you mentioned about
[1:28:39.240 --> 1:28:41.240]  Paul Watson about obviously censorship on your site.
[1:28:41.240 --> 1:28:43.240]  I was mentioning that your viewers
[1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:45.240]  should realize obviously people in the U.K.
[1:28:45.240 --> 1:28:51.240]  have tried to access your site quite a few times.
[1:28:51.240 --> 1:28:53.240]  We did not just hang up on him.
[1:28:53.240 --> 1:28:55.240]  He just called in to talk about
[1:28:55.240 --> 1:28:57.240]  how the websites are censored in the U.K.
[1:28:57.240 --> 1:28:58.240]  Yeah, we get these emails,
[1:28:58.240 --> 1:28:59.240]  we get screenshots of this.
[1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:01.240]  We're being censored like this is China.
[1:29:01.240 --> 1:29:03.240]  Paul Watson.
[1:29:03.240 --> 1:29:06.240]  Yeah, I get them all the time.
[1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:08.240]  As you say, we're becoming immune to it,
[1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:10.240]  because, you know, sometimes I just believe
[1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:13.240]  without even checking into it.
[1:29:13.240 --> 1:29:15.240]  So, and it's happening a lot in London
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:17.240]  from what my brother says, people,
[1:29:17.240 --> 1:29:19.240]  he talks who say the same thing
[1:29:19.240 --> 1:29:20.240]  that they can't access it.
[1:29:20.240 --> 1:29:21.240]  John, you just popped in.
[1:29:21.240 --> 1:29:22.240]  What were you saying?
[1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:24.240]  I was just saying, I hear him, he's there.
[1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:26.240]  Okay, Collar, you're back.
[1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:28.240]  You're saying you can't get to info wars
[1:29:28.240 --> 1:29:30.240]  in present planet?
[1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:32.240]  No, and another thing is,
[1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:34.240]  mentioned on this
[1:29:34.240 --> 1:29:37.240]  tutorialization state that we're in,
[1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:39.240]  obviously I've spread the message
[1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:41.240]  in the place that I live in the U.K.
[1:29:41.240 --> 1:29:43.240]  and it's not so far away from where Paul is, actually.
[1:29:43.240 --> 1:29:46.240]  And it's amazing how I've been followed,
[1:29:46.240 --> 1:29:48.240]  I've been watched.
[1:29:48.240 --> 1:29:51.240]  We've got to jump, here we go.
[1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:55.240]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.240 --> 1:29:57.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN.
[1:29:57.240 --> 1:29:58.240]  Collar, you're back.
[1:29:58.240 --> 1:30:01.240]  You're saying you can't get to info wars
[1:30:01.240 --> 1:30:02.240]  in present planet?
[1:30:02.240 --> 1:30:05.240]  No, and another thing is,
[1:30:05.240 --> 1:30:08.240]  mentioned on this tutorialization state
[1:30:08.240 --> 1:30:10.240]  that we're in, obviously
[1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:12.240]  I've spread the message in the place
[1:30:12.240 --> 1:30:14.240]  that I live in the U.K.
[1:30:14.240 --> 1:30:16.240]  It's not so far away from where Paul is, actually.
[1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:19.240]  And it's amazing how I've been followed,
[1:30:19.240 --> 1:30:21.240]  I've been watched.
[1:30:21.240 --> 1:30:23.240]  We've got to jump, here we go.
[1:30:23.240 --> 1:30:25.240]  We're on the march,
[1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:27.240]  the Empire's on the run.
[1:30:27.240 --> 1:30:30.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:35.240]  Have you ever thought about
[1:30:35.240 --> 1:30:37.240]  what's in your shampoo, sofa detergent?
[1:30:37.240 --> 1:30:39.240]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol,
[1:30:39.240 --> 1:30:42.240]  sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:44.240]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence
[1:30:44.240 --> 1:30:46.240]  of some 4,000 separate ingredients,
[1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:48.240]  most of which are synthetic.
[1:30:48.240 --> 1:30:49.240]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:30:49.240 --> 1:30:50.240]  I was shocked when I discovered
[1:30:50.240 --> 1:30:52.240]  I could be inhaling these additives
[1:30:52.240 --> 1:30:54.240]  that can lead to coughing, wheezing,
[1:30:54.240 --> 1:30:56.240]  and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea,
[1:30:56.240 --> 1:30:58.240]  irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[1:30:58.240 --> 1:31:00.240]  Now compare a cow-bin pure soap,
[1:31:00.240 --> 1:31:02.240]  all natural, earth-friendly,
[1:31:02.240 --> 1:31:04.240]  no harsh chemicals, no animal testing,
[1:31:04.240 --> 1:31:07.240]  they're safe, and you save 85%
[1:31:07.240 --> 1:31:10.240]  of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:12.240]  Start saving over $1,000 a year
[1:31:12.240 --> 1:31:14.240]  for your family of four.
[1:31:14.240 --> 1:31:15.240]  Keep it natural.
[1:31:15.240 --> 1:31:17.240]  Call Cow-bin Pure Soap for a free catalog
[1:31:17.240 --> 1:31:21.240]  at 1-800-340-7091,

[1:31:25.240 --> 1:31:26.240]  and I'll bet you'll never use
[1:31:26.240 --> 1:31:28.240]  any other cleaning products again.
[1:31:28.240 --> 1:31:31.240]  Call 1-800-340-7091
[1:31:31.240 --> 1:31:33.240]  for all your cleaning needs.
[1:31:33.240 --> 1:31:36.240]  On September 11th, 2001,
[1:31:36.240 --> 1:31:38.240]  along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[1:31:38.240 --> 1:31:40.240]  I went to Grounds Hero,
[1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:42.240]  and we knew what to do,
[1:31:42.240 --> 1:31:43.240]  or at least we thought we did.
[1:31:43.240 --> 1:31:46.240]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[1:31:46.240 --> 1:31:48.240]  that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:31:48.240 --> 1:31:50.240]  to tell their story.
[1:31:50.240 --> 1:31:54.240]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th
[1:31:54.240 --> 1:31:57.240]  made a statement that the air
[1:31:57.240 --> 1:31:59.240]  was safe to breathe.
[1:31:59.240 --> 1:32:01.240]  This film follows the growing momentum
[1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:04.240]  of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[1:32:04.240 --> 1:32:06.240]  to take action against their global masters.
[1:32:06.240 --> 1:32:08.240]  He had his hand over the radio
[1:32:08.240 --> 1:32:09.240]  while he was getting a countdown.
[1:32:09.240 --> 1:32:10.240]  He takes his hand off,
[1:32:10.240 --> 1:32:12.240]  and you hear three, two, one,
[1:32:12.240 --> 1:32:15.240]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:32:15.240 --> 1:32:18.240]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[1:32:18.240 --> 1:32:22.240]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv,
[1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:24.240]  and aggressively spread it worldwide,
[1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:27.240]  or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:32:27.240 --> 1:32:29.240]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[1:32:29.240 --> 1:32:31.240]  they're going to commit more acts
[1:32:31.240 --> 1:32:33.240]  and bring in martial law.
[1:32:33.240 --> 1:32:35.240]  Do you ever have one of those days
[1:32:35.240 --> 1:32:37.240]  where everything goes right?
[1:32:37.240 --> 1:32:39.240]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[1:32:39.240 --> 1:32:42.240]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel,
[1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:45.240]  and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[1:32:45.240 --> 1:32:47.240]  Finalized the contract in London,
[1:32:47.240 --> 1:32:49.240]  and demoed our new product in Boston,
[1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:52.240]  online from my desk with WebEx.
[1:32:52.240 --> 1:32:53.240]  WebEx lets me take meetings
[1:32:53.240 --> 1:32:55.240]  and give presentations from my desk.
[1:32:55.240 --> 1:32:57.240]  I just talked to clients on the phone,
[1:32:57.240 --> 1:32:59.240]  and they watch what's happening on my desktop
[1:32:59.240 --> 1:33:00.240]  from their desktop,
[1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:02.240]  so I can travel the world and still be here
[1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:04.240]  with them.
[1:33:04.240 --> 1:33:06.240]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:08.240]  the British government has been caught
[1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:10.240]  censoring prisonplanet.com
[1:33:10.240 --> 1:33:12.240]  and infowars.com.
[1:33:12.240 --> 1:33:16.240]  Don't call my name out your window
[1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:18.240]  when I'm leaving.
[1:33:18.240 --> 1:33:20.240]  I'm putting out more than $10,000
[1:33:20.240 --> 1:33:22.240]  in prizes for you to make videos
[1:33:22.240 --> 1:33:24.240]  exposing this,
[1:33:24.240 --> 1:33:26.240]  but not just my sites,
[1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:28.240]  how they're censoring everything
[1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:30.240]  in the different ways they're doing it.
[1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:32.240]  What they can't stop now
[1:33:32.240 --> 1:33:34.240]  with their trying to shut down is a file-sharing network.
[1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:36.240]  You better get the podcast
[1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:38.240]  that 60,000 listeners a day are getting
[1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:40.240]  and appreciate it and get it out to everybody,

[1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:44.240]  podcasting service system.
[1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:46.240]  It's already number one on most.
[1:33:46.240 --> 1:33:48.240]  Let's make it number one everywhere.
[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:50.240]  We're serving it out to 60,000.
[1:33:50.240 --> 1:33:52.240]  They're serving it out to millions.
[1:33:52.240 --> 1:33:54.240]  We've gone mega viral.
[1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:56.240]  They're trying to shut us down,
[1:33:56.240 --> 1:33:58.240]  and they're not going to get away with it.
[1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:00.240]  There's a lot of different ways to attack
[1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:02.240]  the enemy in the info war.
[1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:04.240]  Get all of our articles.
[1:34:04.240 --> 1:34:06.240]  We put out each day, change the headlines
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:08.240]  because that's how they're trying to block them.
[1:34:08.240 --> 1:34:10.240]  Make it similar to our headline,
[1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:12.240]  but even change the headline if you want.
[1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:14.240]  Then attack pattern Delta.
[1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:16.240]  Put it out everywhere. Smash them
[1:34:16.240 --> 1:34:18.240]  in the info war. Never stop.
[1:34:18.240 --> 1:34:20.240]  This is the highest level alert I've ever given you.
[1:34:20.240 --> 1:34:22.240]  I want rampaging attacks
[1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:24.240]  on the New World Order in the info war.
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:26.240]  Overrun them like you've never done.
[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:28.240]  Severely, savagely attacking.
[1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:30.240]  Get my films. Make copies.
[1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:32.240]  Get the podcasts. Make copies.

[1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:38.240]  hour and a half. It's going to cost us thousands here,
[1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:40.240]  but I'm running it all out to put out this video
[1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:42.240]  free today. Why don't we charge $0.15 today
[1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:44.240]  for PrisonPlanet.tv? Because we can't
[1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:46.240]  afford to put it out free. But you know what?
[1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:48.240]  This last hour and a half is so important
[1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:50.240]  that it's going up the next couple hours
[1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:52.240]  on infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:54.240]  so you can slice and dice and boil it down
[1:34:54.240 --> 1:34:56.240]  everywhere. They go completely nuts
[1:34:56.240 --> 1:34:58.240]  and show these murdering bastards the New World Order.
[1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:00.240]  They're never going to stop us.
[1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:02.240]  Ah, yeah!
[1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:04.240]  Alright, we're about to go to Dr. Jerome Corsi
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:06.240]  breaking major news here today. We're so thankful
[1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:08.240]  for him coming on this show to do it. First place
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:10.240]  you're going to hear it, the embargo
[1:35:10.240 --> 1:35:12.240]  is lifted today on his abomination books.
[1:35:12.240 --> 1:35:14.240]  We'll be breaking that down for us, and I don't like
[1:35:14.240 --> 1:35:16.240]  either candidate. We're just exposing them all.
[1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:18.240]  Let the chips fall where they may. You have 60 seconds
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:20.240]  Paul Watson in your final transmission
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:22.240]  on this subject today.

[1:35:28.240 --> 1:35:30.240]  whatsonatprisonplanet.com
[1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:32.240]  and I'll post as many
[1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:34.240]  as possible. And
[1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:36.240]  it's another rallying call to organize behind
[1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:38.240]  and get active
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:40.240]  and get aggressive with the truth.
[1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:42.240]  Defend free speech, stop communist
[1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:44.240]  Chinese style censorship. PrisonPlanet
[1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:46.240]  banned in the UK

[1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:16.240]  today.
[1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:18.240]  Well, I've been researching Obama in this
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:20.240]  county for a few years now
[1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:22.240]  and I've been through it.
[1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:24.240]  I've looked to it, this really sells
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:26.240]  this great suit.
[1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:28.240]  And you've got to go out and copy it whatever
[1:36:28.240 --> 1:36:30.240]  and print it, but
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:32.240]  from 100 minutes from now,
[1:36:32.240 --> 1:36:34.240]  it's something that happens to
[1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:36.240]  a lot of the people around the world,
[1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:38.240]  you probably won't buy it.

[1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:48.280]  day
[1:36:48.280 --> 1:36:52.660]  well i've been researching obama in this new book the obama nation
[1:36:52.660 --> 1:36:53.780]  uh... force
[1:36:53.780 --> 1:36:55.640]  this is two thousand six
[1:36:55.640 --> 1:36:59.420]  uh... that was when i decided obama was likely to be the candidate i started
[1:36:59.420 --> 1:37:01.100]  researching and the book is
[1:37:01.100 --> 1:37:03.780]  alexis three hundred sixty pages long
[1:37:03.780 --> 1:37:06.600]  i've got nearly seven hundred footnotes in it
[1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:08.740]  and the footnotes are all you know if you
[1:37:08.740 --> 1:37:11.180]  many of them are websites you can see them
[1:37:11.180 --> 1:37:13.060]  i thoroughly researched it
[1:37:13.060 --> 1:37:14.440]  uh... for instance i did
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:16.260]  phone interviews in kenya
[1:37:16.260 --> 1:37:18.820]  uh... and uh... indonesia where

[1:37:23.820 --> 1:37:27.740]  i translated it as long ago the from indonesian
[1:37:27.740 --> 1:37:31.860]  translated the indonesian newspapers i went to the indonesian tv
[1:37:31.860 --> 1:37:35.060]  which hundreds of hours of indonesian tv kenyan tv
[1:37:35.060 --> 1:37:37.700]  but think that the book is thoroughly documented
[1:37:37.700 --> 1:37:41.740]  and i'll stand by every statement every claim in the book
[1:37:41.740 --> 1:37:45.480]  well drop the bombshells on us all the pre-release of these

[1:37:51.180 --> 1:37:52.820]  i show that going back
[1:37:52.820 --> 1:37:54.960]  to obama's mentor
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:37:57.340]  and uh... when he was in hawaii
[1:37:57.340 --> 1:37:58.720]  in high school

[1:41:43.340 --> 1:41:46.300]  essentially multi-million dollar property
[1:41:46.300 --> 1:41:47.740]  with two lots
[1:41:47.740 --> 1:41:49.100]  you know what it is
[1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:51.860]  with the victorian redone houses
[1:41:51.860 --> 1:41:54.240]  and uh... obama can afford it
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:41:56.700]  so resko's wife buys the
[1:41:56.700 --> 1:41:58.140]  vacant lot
[1:41:58.140 --> 1:42:00.100]  that is part of the property
[1:42:00.100 --> 1:42:03.780]  bent in this two-lot property on which the house sits
[1:42:03.780 --> 1:42:06.620]  obama gets a cheaper deal on the house
[1:42:06.620 --> 1:42:09.220]  and then after the deal goes down
[1:42:09.220 --> 1:42:11.340]  uh... obama's wife
[1:42:11.340 --> 1:42:13.260]  cell the vacant lot
[1:42:13.260 --> 1:42:15.780]  in part back to reto obama
[1:42:15.780 --> 1:42:18.860]  buys part of the back ten feet of the vacant lot
[1:42:18.860 --> 1:42:20.620]  and they sell the rest of it
[1:42:20.620 --> 1:42:22.580]  to a friend of obama
[1:42:22.580 --> 1:42:25.780]  and the friend of the alderman in the area who will not permit
[1:42:25.780 --> 1:42:28.060]  another property to be built on it
[1:42:28.060 --> 1:42:29.620]  so for half the deal
[1:42:29.620 --> 1:42:32.380]  obama and i'm getting the whole property
[1:42:32.380 --> 1:42:33.660]  and in the mess
[1:42:33.660 --> 1:42:35.940]  in all that mess with resko
[1:42:35.940 --> 1:42:37.220]  this criminal
[1:42:37.220 --> 1:42:39.320]  you know getting a million out of
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:42.700]  bill king the poor and their housing projects
[1:42:42.700 --> 1:42:45.680]  obama's benefactor and great buddy
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:47.660]  when they needed more money
[1:42:47.660 --> 1:42:48.740]  right at the time this
[1:42:48.740 --> 1:42:51.080]  house transaction was coming down
[1:42:51.080 --> 1:42:52.980]  not me out key
[1:42:52.980 --> 1:42:58.460]  out key is the bag man for some of the same oil for food deal
[1:42:58.460 --> 1:43:01.180]  on billionaire lives in london
[1:43:01.180 --> 1:43:05.060]  one of the um... owners of bank bnp parable
[1:43:05.060 --> 1:43:06.180]  criminal bank
[1:43:06.180 --> 1:43:09.460]  that did the oil for food deal for some of the same
[1:43:09.460 --> 1:43:14.260]  well out key lends resko something like three point seven million dollars just
[1:43:14.260 --> 1:43:16.180]  at the right time
[1:43:16.180 --> 1:43:17.380]  for obama's
[1:43:17.380 --> 1:43:18.660]  down payment
[1:43:18.660 --> 1:43:22.100]  to be made it for the down payment a lot next door to be made so not just
[1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:27.340]  the not just chicago style mafia corruption but hardcore international
[1:43:27.340 --> 1:43:31.980]  uh... deals with uh... traffickers uh... who work with people like sonoma
[1:43:31.980 --> 1:43:36.580]  correct and the these connections through arty in the middle east are not
[1:43:36.580 --> 1:43:39.900]  you know that twenty resko has a whole network of them
[1:43:39.900 --> 1:43:41.180]  i tracked down
[1:43:41.180 --> 1:43:44.020]  others of al-samari and other
[1:43:44.020 --> 1:43:46.340]  uh... iraqi he was
[1:43:46.340 --> 1:43:50.660]  are trying to corner the failure of the cell phone market
[1:43:50.660 --> 1:43:52.820]  in iraq after the war
[1:43:52.820 --> 1:43:56.180]  and he had to resko involved in the scheme
[1:43:56.180 --> 1:43:57.300]  and of course
[1:43:57.300 --> 1:44:01.540]  you know all summer he put down his home in chicago
[1:44:01.540 --> 1:44:06.780]  of all places as part of the bail for resko when resko was in jail well that's
[1:44:06.780 --> 1:44:09.500]  why i don't really have a business partner
[1:44:09.500 --> 1:44:12.020]  that's why the establishment likes obama
[1:44:12.020 --> 1:44:14.900]  because there's so much dirt on him
[1:44:14.900 --> 1:44:16.820]  they can fully compromise him
[1:44:16.820 --> 1:44:21.140]  political moment at any of these totally vulnerable because
[1:44:21.140 --> 1:44:25.900]  the financial ties go back to guy like resko
[1:44:25.900 --> 1:44:29.420]  the very minority community that obama is trying to champion
[1:44:29.420 --> 1:44:32.380]  while obama was resko's lawyer
[1:44:32.380 --> 1:44:36.580]  and they put obama is such a good job helping this criminal resko
[1:44:36.580 --> 1:44:40.060]  he made sure that he michelle the two girls got this dream house they couldn't
[1:44:40.060 --> 1:44:41.020]  afford
[1:44:41.020 --> 1:44:43.900]  and what became necessary to get a little more cash
[1:44:43.900 --> 1:44:46.740]  they called up i'll key in the phone and had some money wired in from the
[1:44:46.740 --> 1:44:50.100]  middle east now what what are they getting from barack obama for all
[1:44:50.100 --> 1:44:51.620]  these goodies are giving
[1:44:51.620 --> 1:44:54.020]  well obama has a long history
[1:44:54.020 --> 1:44:55.820]  of supporting
[1:44:55.820 --> 1:44:59.320]  pro-palestinian anti-israel
[1:44:59.320 --> 1:45:00.420]  our groups
[1:45:00.420 --> 1:45:02.420]  they funded in chicago
[1:45:02.420 --> 1:45:05.740]  when obama was on this woods foundation
[1:45:05.740 --> 1:45:06.780]  with william
[1:45:06.780 --> 1:45:07.780]  airs
[1:45:07.780 --> 1:45:09.260]  was by the way the
[1:45:09.260 --> 1:45:11.540]  of the weather underground bomber
[1:45:11.540 --> 1:45:12.860]  they funded
[1:45:12.860 --> 1:45:15.540]  this arab american network
[1:45:15.540 --> 1:45:18.060]  that rashi khalidi put together
[1:45:18.060 --> 1:45:22.700]  strongly pro-palestinian strongly strongly anti-israel
[1:45:22.700 --> 1:45:24.660]  i had carried through again
[1:45:24.660 --> 1:45:26.260]  to the president because
[1:45:26.260 --> 1:45:28.940]  the current advisers that obama
[1:45:28.940 --> 1:45:32.140]  has working on his campaign including this
[1:45:32.140 --> 1:45:34.260]  general tony mcpeak
[1:45:34.260 --> 1:45:37.060]  who is the co-chairman of obama's current
[1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:38.860]  presidential campaign
[1:45:38.860 --> 1:45:42.380]  has been writing articles in which he says for instance that the
[1:45:42.380 --> 1:45:45.740]  the jews in miami in new york are the reason
[1:45:45.740 --> 1:45:49.220]  that because our foreign policies influence to be pro
[1:45:49.220 --> 1:45:53.340]  israel and that's the reason the israel conflict can't be settled
[1:45:53.340 --> 1:45:57.580]  is far back in nineteen seventy six is general mcpeak was writing in foreign
[1:45:57.580 --> 1:46:00.940]  affairs well the magazine the council for relations
[1:46:00.940 --> 1:46:03.420]  insisting that israel needed to give back
[1:46:03.420 --> 1:46:07.340]  part of the goal and height in the west bank well i want to be clear here
[1:46:07.340 --> 1:46:10.780]  either way you cut it both candidates are new world order brocco mama there
[1:46:10.780 --> 1:46:14.300]  was any doubt called for the new world order so well we all have to work hard
[1:46:14.300 --> 1:46:17.020]  we don't have a choice we must serve this global
[1:46:17.020 --> 1:46:18.220]  government
[1:46:18.220 --> 1:46:21.940]  uh... just a week and a half ago when he was in berlin
[1:46:21.940 --> 1:46:25.660]  but regardless this either goes two ways
[1:46:25.660 --> 1:46:28.820]  they allow him into office because he's totally compromised
[1:46:28.820 --> 1:46:32.660]  and the establishment can destroy him anytime they want with all this
[1:46:32.660 --> 1:46:36.060]  information that's been documented in triplicate
[1:46:36.060 --> 1:46:38.300]  they're planning to totally destroy him
[1:46:38.300 --> 1:46:41.700]  once the full nomination happens during the campaign
[1:46:41.700 --> 1:46:44.740]  uh... and then mccain's going to go in
[1:46:44.740 --> 1:46:46.180]  either way
[1:46:46.180 --> 1:46:47.940]  uh...
[1:46:47.940 --> 1:46:49.080]  we get a globalist
[1:46:49.080 --> 1:46:53.100]  you know we get a globalist and i see massive riots
[1:46:53.100 --> 1:46:55.540]  uh... if if they do shoot down
[1:46:55.540 --> 1:46:58.900]  uh... obama so i i i i may be wrong but it looks like
[1:46:58.900 --> 1:47:00.300]  the establishment
[1:47:00.300 --> 1:47:04.100]  the big money is behind obama because he's fully compromised and uh... you
[1:47:04.100 --> 1:47:08.460]  know i was obama is going to lose i'm sure that the compromise of the obama
[1:47:08.460 --> 1:47:09.340]  has
[1:47:09.340 --> 1:47:12.100]  and not escape the interest of the money people
[1:47:12.100 --> 1:47:13.580]  who are behind obama
[1:47:13.580 --> 1:47:14.900]  and um...
[1:47:14.900 --> 1:47:16.680]  you know this is clearly
[1:47:16.680 --> 1:47:20.460]  i've chosen you know the lesser of the two evils uh... i'm i did not write
[1:47:20.460 --> 1:47:21.820]  obama nation
[1:47:21.820 --> 1:47:24.780]  to support mccain i make this very clear
[1:47:24.780 --> 1:47:28.140]  i wrote obama nation only to oppose obama
[1:47:28.140 --> 1:47:29.380]  and uh... i'm
[1:47:29.380 --> 1:47:32.340]  on myself in constitution party i'll vote for
[1:47:32.340 --> 1:47:35.500]  odd chuck baldwin that's where my vote's going
[1:47:35.500 --> 1:47:38.200]  i have all of mccain is the president
[1:47:38.200 --> 1:47:41.380]  will have to fight i've been writing in world that daily where i miss us you
[1:47:41.380 --> 1:47:43.020]  know senior staff reporter
[1:47:43.020 --> 1:47:46.060]  i've been writing for four years hard against mccain
[1:47:46.060 --> 1:47:49.340]  uh... comprehensive immigration reform that he was going for with ted
[1:47:49.340 --> 1:47:52.060]  kennedy we know that i'm sure i will be ready against
[1:47:52.060 --> 1:47:55.820]  him for four more years dr corp of course he i mean bottom line
[1:47:55.820 --> 1:47:58.860]  uh... you then think that the establishment
[1:47:58.860 --> 1:48:02.260]  is going to destroy barack obama you're saying it's john mccain
[1:48:02.260 --> 1:48:04.580]  i think i'm a king is going to be the next day i think we're gonna have a
[1:48:04.580 --> 1:48:06.220]  riots
[1:48:06.220 --> 1:48:07.460]  possible
[1:48:07.460 --> 1:48:09.140]  could easily happen
[1:48:09.140 --> 1:48:11.380]  i think the african-american community
[1:48:11.380 --> 1:48:14.420]  is not going to like seeing barack obama
[1:48:14.420 --> 1:48:15.460]  uh...
[1:48:15.460 --> 1:48:17.580]  really attacked at the strongly
[1:48:17.580 --> 1:48:18.980]  but the problem is
[1:48:18.980 --> 1:48:23.060]  alex everything i'm bringing forward is true well he's a poverty pimp he's a
[1:48:23.060 --> 1:48:25.700]  poverty pimp so black shouldn't like him
[1:48:25.700 --> 1:48:29.820]  well he didn't want to understand that blacks may understand that the that this
[1:48:29.820 --> 1:48:33.100]  obama is not the guy they thought he was
[1:48:33.100 --> 1:48:34.220]  i also
[1:48:34.220 --> 1:48:38.660]  have traced obama's connections into africa very well let's stop there
[1:48:38.660 --> 1:48:40.700]  that's what i want to cover the rest of the show
[1:48:40.700 --> 1:48:43.340]  he brought a lot of stuff it's already been documented mainstream news from new
[1:48:43.340 --> 1:48:44.260]  connections
[1:48:44.260 --> 1:48:45.700]  that weren't dr corp c
[1:48:45.700 --> 1:48:47.220]  uh... let's get into
[1:48:47.220 --> 1:48:51.500]  uh... barack hussein obama is he really a muslim was his dad really a muslim
[1:48:51.500 --> 1:48:53.500]  okay go ahead and tell us
[1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:57.620]  first of all it obama said he never got a lot of construction it's not true
[1:48:57.620 --> 1:49:00.580]  in indonesia and he was there from six to nine
[1:49:00.580 --> 1:49:02.940]  his islamic stepfather
[1:49:02.940 --> 1:49:06.540]  uh... read registered obama even the catholic school he registered in the
[1:49:06.540 --> 1:49:07.580]  muslim
[1:49:07.580 --> 1:49:09.420]  and then in the public school is
[1:49:09.420 --> 1:49:11.780]  at least one year maybe two
[1:49:11.780 --> 1:49:13.940]  obama got islamic instruction
[1:49:13.940 --> 1:49:17.580]  and i thought i would like that is bomb shell
[1:49:17.580 --> 1:49:21.220]  dr corp c yet uh... that is bombshell because not that
[1:49:21.220 --> 1:49:25.100]  he's really a muslim that he's lied he's a lot about it
[1:49:25.100 --> 1:49:27.540]  and that we shouldn't have anybody
[1:49:27.540 --> 1:49:31.540]  as president who both their parents are americans bottom line
[1:49:31.540 --> 1:49:35.120]  that's always been the way it is and uh... that they've been passed laws
[1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:38.820]  in europe against people from outside becoming president or chancellor it
[1:49:38.820 --> 1:49:40.420]  because it's this allows
[1:49:40.420 --> 1:49:43.980]  infiltration you're telling me tell us the proof in your book
[1:49:43.980 --> 1:49:47.260]  that that that barack obama did attend muslim school
[1:49:47.260 --> 1:49:51.220]  well the first proof that i found a line in obama's owner by a biography where
[1:49:51.220 --> 1:49:52.860]  he admitted it unbelievable
[1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:56.020]  he said in one passing line about a page of
[1:49:56.020 --> 1:49:57.260]  on the middle of the book
[1:49:57.260 --> 1:49:58.980]  obama says his mother
[1:49:58.980 --> 1:50:01.800]  uh... with angry at him because he made
[1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:05.060]  they made faces in coran studies
[1:50:05.060 --> 1:50:07.780]  and you know that one sentence validated
[1:50:07.780 --> 1:50:12.220]  then the indonesian newspapers which i translated in the indonesian television
[1:50:12.220 --> 1:50:15.740]  went back and interviewed schoolmates of obama
[1:50:15.740 --> 1:50:17.340]  they said he attended
[1:50:17.340 --> 1:50:20.300]  uh... islamic instruction in the public school
[1:50:20.300 --> 1:50:23.700]  they also said all four years obama was there he went to
[1:50:23.700 --> 1:50:24.660]  mosque
[1:50:24.660 --> 1:50:29.180]  with his father so it's not a little girl it's it yet it's not a rumor his
[1:50:29.180 --> 1:50:32.340]  uh... stepfather was a muslim he has a family
[1:50:32.340 --> 1:50:34.620]  uh... brothers and people that are muslims
[1:50:34.620 --> 1:50:37.020]  and so bottom line he has been lying
[1:50:37.020 --> 1:50:39.180]  the entire time and that's why they put him up there
[1:50:39.180 --> 1:50:41.940]  he is a ringer folks he's meant to take a dive
[1:50:41.940 --> 1:50:44.340]  for john mccain so this is not partisan
[1:50:44.340 --> 1:50:48.700]  the facts are and he will be destroyed in this election
[1:50:48.700 --> 1:50:49.740]  i believe so and
[1:50:49.740 --> 1:50:53.380]  you know if the the lies continue because for instance
[1:50:53.380 --> 1:50:57.820]  obama in two thousand seven was interviewed by nicholas christoff
[1:50:57.820 --> 1:50:59.780]  with a columnist in the
[1:50:59.780 --> 1:51:02.580]  on new york times and christoff wrote this up
[1:51:02.580 --> 1:51:04.980]  obama came into his office and
[1:51:04.980 --> 1:51:08.860]  saying the islamic call to prayer in the sunset
[1:51:08.860 --> 1:51:10.820]  he did it perfectly
[1:51:10.820 --> 1:51:15.860]  and in arabic and christoff said obama said that that's one of the most
[1:51:15.860 --> 1:51:19.420]  beautiful sounds the prettiest sounds on earth at sunset

[1:55:14.100 --> 1:55:19.300]  the last hour and a half of the show but I want john to go through the calls and
[1:55:19.300 --> 1:55:23.220]  find out who wants to talk to dr. coursey about this issue in the last 10
[1:55:23.220 --> 1:55:28.020]  minutes with him he's gonna be with us about 15 20 after so this is an
[1:55:28.020 --> 1:55:30.900]  exclusive first big interview he's done his first day can talk about the book
[1:55:30.900 --> 1:55:33.820]  we're so honored he's joined us you know I have differences of dr. coursey on a
[1:55:33.820 --> 1:55:39.980]  few issues but the world is more complex and many of you you know see it as as
[1:55:39.980 --> 1:55:45.340]  as you know the players this is more sophisticated and dr. course has come a
[1:55:45.340 --> 1:55:48.060]  long way and fight in the new world order into waking up the state sponsored
[1:55:48.060 --> 1:55:51.620]  terror and a lot more but this barack obama thing the way the media is
[1:55:51.620 --> 1:55:56.500]  worshiping him is scary this is the setup I believe it is going to be the
[1:55:56.500 --> 1:56:01.700]  setup and that they are going to pull the rug out from under him by design to
[1:56:01.700 --> 1:56:05.900]  create more racial division and then give us john mccain so we're saying you
[1:56:05.900 --> 1:56:09.300]  can't vote for either one we're just analyzing the cold hard facts and
[1:56:09.300 --> 1:56:13.780]  folks his name is barack hussain obama he was raised in foreign countries
[1:56:13.780 --> 1:56:17.380]  indonesia and africa he does have communist all over the place everywhere
[1:56:17.380 --> 1:56:21.740]  he does have marxists everywhere he does have muslims everywhere and I'm not
[1:56:21.740 --> 1:56:25.780]  even attacking muslims here muslims know that but I'm not going to play games
[1:56:25.780 --> 1:56:30.140]  here well just like I don't play games with Saudi Arabia and the wahhabi is
[1:56:30.140 --> 1:56:33.540]  that the CIA is involved with you just because somebody's a muslim doesn't
[1:56:33.540 --> 1:56:38.860]  suddenly mean they're good no contrary ladies and gentlemen he is a liar he is
[1:56:38.860 --> 1:56:43.300]  a liar about his faith and who he is and this is outrageous but the point is
[1:56:43.300 --> 1:56:47.500]  black people democrats liberals you'd love to be able to vote for somebody
[1:56:47.500 --> 1:56:50.620]  real they're going to take him away from you they're going to crush him right in
[1:56:50.620 --> 1:56:53.940]  front of you dr. course you do agree with that analysis yes I think you're
[1:56:53.940 --> 1:56:59.500]  right but i think you've got a situation where brock brock obama had lied it so
[1:56:59.500 --> 1:57:04.500]  thoroughly and now that i right obama nation and i've got got close to seven
[1:57:04.500 --> 1:57:09.580]  hundred footnotes i'm documenting not only his education is a with a you know
[1:57:09.580 --> 1:57:14.900]  communist socialist mentor and hawaii is working under Saul linsky and that
[1:57:14.900 --> 1:57:20.260]  radical system in chicago i've influenced by malcolm acts is this black
[1:57:20.260 --> 1:57:24.780]  liberation theology and now is working can you which goes right back to his
[1:57:24.780 --> 1:57:28.380]  father's roots but let's be fair to malcolm he changed at the end that's
[1:57:28.380 --> 1:57:29.620]  why you got killed
[1:57:29.620 --> 1:57:31.220]  we have to talk about
[1:57:31.220 --> 1:57:35.140]  the party on your own obama identifies with his you know the autobiography of
[1:57:35.140 --> 1:57:40.020]  malcolm acts and even to malcolm acts railing on this obama specifically
[1:57:40.020 --> 1:57:42.200]  discusses in his autobiography
[1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:45.660]  auto you know malcolm acts railing he's got white blood in him and he wants to
[1:57:45.660 --> 1:57:46.660]  get out of it
[1:57:46.660 --> 1:57:51.260]  i guess and obama saying what he has white blood and he identified
[1:57:51.260 --> 1:57:53.060]  with that is a curse
[1:57:53.060 --> 1:57:53.900]  well that's
[1:57:53.900 --> 1:57:55.400]  though that's right out of
[1:57:55.400 --> 1:57:59.700]  black liberation theology is malcolm acts influence james call you know white
[1:57:59.700 --> 1:58:02.600]  people of the devil and i'm sick of it with the devil
[1:58:02.600 --> 1:58:04.800]  and we are the you know we are the
[1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:08.340]  imperialists and the colonialist of today oppressing
[1:58:08.340 --> 1:58:12.900]  african-american ghetto is that we're subhuman we're a subcreation we're
[1:58:12.900 --> 1:58:14.300]  basically came
[1:58:14.300 --> 1:58:18.020]  and that's you know that's the part of the black liberation theology that
[1:58:18.020 --> 1:58:22.220]  shares with the black muslims in malcolm acts well it's the reverse i mean
[1:58:22.220 --> 1:58:25.140]  the slave traders who by the way were predominantly arab they taught the
[1:58:25.140 --> 1:58:26.380]  white european how to do it
[1:58:26.380 --> 1:58:28.420]  historical factors like appear but anika
[1:58:28.420 --> 1:58:29.860]  historical fact
[1:58:29.860 --> 1:58:33.860]  uh... that's basically what the racist Arabs and whites taught was that blacks
[1:58:33.860 --> 1:58:34.560]  were
[1:58:34.560 --> 1:58:38.260]  were a bad creation now they just flip it around they're both disgusting
[1:58:38.260 --> 1:58:39.780]  disgusting and you know but
[1:58:39.780 --> 1:58:44.540]  this whole james cone is saying that this is the core of black liberation
[1:58:44.540 --> 1:58:46.060]  right
[1:58:46.060 --> 1:58:48.180]  is that jesus christ was
[1:58:48.180 --> 1:58:51.500]  black he was a african palestinian opposing
[1:58:51.500 --> 1:58:55.540]  the imperialist colonialist of the day which would be the romans occupying
[1:58:55.540 --> 1:58:56.540]  israel
[1:58:56.540 --> 1:58:57.380]  and so
[1:58:57.380 --> 1:59:01.380]  reverend right when he says gd america is really at the core
[1:59:01.380 --> 1:59:05.420]  of what black liberation theologies all about which by the way the globalist
[1:59:05.420 --> 1:59:08.700]  what the illegal aliens and gd america and the blacks they want to bring
[1:59:08.700 --> 1:59:13.700]  america down so they're serving the new world order will be right back
[1:59:13.700 --> 1:59:15.700]  you
[1:59:15.700 --> 1:59:18.700]  uh...
[1:59:18.700 --> 1:59:19.700]  is it
[1:59:19.700 --> 1:59:20.700]  you
[1:59:20.700 --> 1:59:21.700]  uh...
[1:59:21.700 --> 1:59:22.700]  uh...

[1:59:50.700 --> 1:59:53.700]  seven years after the attacks of september eleven

[2:00:55.700 --> 2:01:01.700]  tie-in to prisonplanet.com and infowars.com being censored in europe england
[2:01:01.700 --> 2:01:03.700]  universities
[2:01:03.700 --> 2:01:05.700]  corporations here in the u.s.
[2:01:05.700 --> 2:01:10.700]  being put on the software people download to quote fsafe internet serving
[2:01:10.700 --> 2:01:14.700]  i've seen it documented all over the place that barack obama websites
[2:01:14.700 --> 2:01:18.700]  their isps are being shut down people are having their accounts terminated
[2:01:18.700 --> 2:01:22.700]  there's an army of lawyers that's even come out in the news that are going around doing this
[2:01:22.700 --> 2:01:26.700]  so there's big muscle behind censoring the web for that as well let's digress
[2:01:26.700 --> 2:01:29.700]  into that for a moment doctor course because you and i were talking about it
[2:01:29.700 --> 2:01:30.700]  during the break
[2:01:30.700 --> 2:01:33.700]  well i i'm finding increasingly that
[2:01:33.700 --> 2:01:37.700]  sites or photographs or material i used on brock obama
[2:01:37.700 --> 2:01:40.700]  get taken down after i've been writing about it
[2:01:40.700 --> 2:01:43.700]  we did as much capture of world that daily of sites
[2:01:43.700 --> 2:01:47.700]  and photographs as we could before they got taken down
[2:01:47.700 --> 2:01:50.700]  and and alex i really want to get the story about kenya
[2:01:50.700 --> 2:01:54.700]  i think this is critical understand you got the floor you've got the floor
[2:01:54.700 --> 2:01:55.700]  obama
[2:01:55.700 --> 2:01:59.700]  went back to kenya in two thousand six and he started supporting
[2:01:59.700 --> 2:02:00.700]  this uh...
[2:02:00.700 --> 2:02:03.700]  uh... politician right we love or dinga
[2:02:03.700 --> 2:02:08.700]  but then there's a radical socialist who was a identified with obama's father
[2:02:08.700 --> 2:02:11.700]  or didn't go to god dot or double all the father
[2:02:11.700 --> 2:02:16.700]  was um... but he was vice president in the ken kenya to government
[2:02:16.700 --> 2:02:21.700]  to see when act when kenya was independent but they were both communists
[2:02:21.700 --> 2:02:26.700]  right now or dinga got his education in east germany and he named his first son
[2:02:26.700 --> 2:02:29.700]  fidel okay now
[2:02:29.700 --> 2:02:32.700]  what's obama did in two thousand six when he went back
[2:02:32.700 --> 2:02:35.700]  ought to visit in africa as he started
[2:02:35.700 --> 2:02:36.700]  supporting
[2:02:36.700 --> 2:02:38.700]  this all radical
[2:02:38.700 --> 2:02:40.700]  um... or dinga
[2:02:40.700 --> 2:02:43.700]  for the presidency you go dinga was running for the presidency
[2:02:43.700 --> 2:02:48.700]  and i i i even fight and run on world medallion up there now
[2:02:48.700 --> 2:02:50.700]  a uh... videotape
[2:02:50.700 --> 2:02:51.700]  in which the
[2:02:51.700 --> 2:02:54.700]  uh... one of the spokespeople for the government
[2:02:54.700 --> 2:02:58.700]  president kibaki sports per person alfred mutua
[2:02:58.700 --> 2:03:03.700]  said that all obama was improper inappropriately meddling in kenyan politics
[2:03:03.700 --> 2:03:05.700]  and become a stooge
[2:03:05.700 --> 2:03:06.700]  for odinga
[2:03:06.700 --> 2:03:09.700]  that carry the story forward odinga
[2:03:09.700 --> 2:03:14.700]  in a time of understanding with the radical islamicists in kenya
[2:03:14.700 --> 2:03:16.700]  saying that he would expand
[2:03:16.700 --> 2:03:19.700]  sharia and support the islamic
[2:03:19.700 --> 2:03:21.700]  areas of the country
[2:03:21.700 --> 2:03:24.700]  if the out the moslems would vote for him
[2:03:24.700 --> 2:03:29.700]  and chic abdull abdi who signed this agreement gave a press conference
[2:03:29.700 --> 2:03:33.700]  i cited in the book i also show the press conference on world medallion
[2:03:33.700 --> 2:03:36.700]  in the youtube video clip
[2:03:36.700 --> 2:03:39.700]  supported the islamicists
[2:03:39.700 --> 2:03:40.700]  then with odinga
[2:03:40.700 --> 2:03:44.700]  looses in december two thousand seven to kibaki
[2:03:44.700 --> 2:03:47.700]  odinga prompts protest which lead into
[2:03:47.700 --> 2:03:51.700]  several weeks of violence a thousand people are killed
[2:03:51.700 --> 2:03:56.700]  the luo tribe odinga's tribe which is also obama's tribe
[2:03:56.700 --> 2:03:58.700]  start killing kikuyu
[2:03:58.700 --> 2:04:00.700]  and they also start killing christians
[2:04:00.700 --> 2:04:04.700]  so an elder at one town in in kenya
[2:04:04.700 --> 2:04:07.700]  Christians end up trying to get refuge in a church
[2:04:07.700 --> 2:04:10.700]  and these angry luo mobs burn it down
[2:04:10.700 --> 2:04:12.700]  mean it's basically
[2:04:12.700 --> 2:04:16.700]  and and all obama through the whole period of time including during the
[2:04:16.700 --> 2:04:18.700]  new hampshire primary
[2:04:18.700 --> 2:04:22.700]  was on the phone almost daily back to africa advising odinga
[2:04:22.700 --> 2:04:25.700]  so here you've got a guy running for president united states
[2:04:25.700 --> 2:04:28.700]  whose father was kenyan went back to kenya
[2:04:28.700 --> 2:04:30.700]  the failed politician
[2:04:30.700 --> 2:04:35.700]  himself obama's now trying to recover his father's legacy
[2:04:35.700 --> 2:04:39.700]  supported this right right now odinga who's the son
[2:04:39.700 --> 2:04:43.700]  even though the son signs memorandum of understanding with the islamic groups
[2:04:43.700 --> 2:04:46.700]  and encourages violence in order to get to be
[2:04:46.700 --> 2:04:51.700]  prime minister under kibaki which he now is that's how they settled the violence
[2:04:51.700 --> 2:04:53.700]  despite the fact of violence
[2:04:53.700 --> 2:04:58.700]  killed a thousand people displaced three hundred fifty thousand in kenya
[2:04:58.700 --> 2:05:01.700]  tribal violence luo against kakuyu
[2:05:01.700 --> 2:05:05.700]  and ended up being a religious violence muslims against christians
[2:05:05.700 --> 2:05:10.700]  and obama's never stopped supporting odinga
[2:05:10.700 --> 2:05:15.700]  amazing story amazing we'll go through more of his roots i want you to recap

[2:09:08.700 --> 2:09:12.700]  so many people that are holding like frank and
[2:09:12.700 --> 2:09:16.700]  carl and everybody else like scott carl fred and others are for dr. coursey

[2:09:22.700 --> 2:09:26.700]  important we're only covering the facts here dr. coursey is very careful
[2:09:26.700 --> 2:09:31.700]  so i've read three of his books i mean legret usa is excellent we carried it
[2:09:31.700 --> 2:09:35.700]  info wars dot com on having the source documents in triplicate he's a best
[2:09:35.700 --> 2:09:38.700]  selling author researcher
[2:09:38.700 --> 2:09:41.700]  has a degree from harvard
[2:09:41.700 --> 2:09:45.700]  and he's telling you this stuff's going on the rock obama you can take it to the bank
[2:09:45.700 --> 2:09:48.700]  now again even if you're a barack obama supporter you've been set up
[2:09:48.700 --> 2:09:51.700]  this is all going to be brought out
[2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:55.700]  and uh... it's it's it's meant to turn the country in against itself
[2:09:55.700 --> 2:09:59.700]  just did it recap all the key points about the muslim stuff in the communist
[2:09:59.700 --> 2:10:01.700]  stuff than anything else you haven't covered
[2:10:01.700 --> 2:10:05.700]  well the fact that we just covered it where obama is very deeply involved in
[2:10:05.700 --> 2:10:07.700]  kenyan politics
[2:10:07.700 --> 2:10:11.700]  supporting this right now or dinga running for president
[2:10:11.700 --> 2:10:14.700]  who you know with it goes back to his father because i think his father and
[2:10:14.700 --> 2:10:16.700]  obama's father were tied together
[2:10:16.700 --> 2:10:20.700]  i think you know generation earlier in kenyan politics
[2:10:20.700 --> 2:10:23.700]  and as well i don't think it's time to memorandum of understanding
[2:10:23.700 --> 2:10:28.700]  with the radical islamicists in kenya to support sharia law
[2:10:28.700 --> 2:10:31.700]  uh... obama continues to support odinga
[2:10:31.700 --> 2:10:34.700]  but i think it loses the december two thousand seven this only happened a few
[2:10:34.700 --> 2:10:36.700]  months ago
[2:10:36.700 --> 2:10:40.700]  he loses the presidential election prompts protest which lead to a wave of
[2:10:40.700 --> 2:10:43.700]  violence a thousand people in kenya are killed
[2:10:43.700 --> 2:10:46.700]  three hundred fifty thousand displaced three hundred
[2:10:46.700 --> 2:10:48.700]  christian church is destroyed
[2:10:48.700 --> 2:10:50.700]  no mosques destroyed
[2:10:50.700 --> 2:10:52.700]  and the violence against the luo tribesmen both
[2:10:52.700 --> 2:10:56.700]  obama and odinga are luo tribesmen
[2:10:56.700 --> 2:11:00.700]  so the violence was against the kakuyu majority tribe which is president
[2:11:00.700 --> 2:11:01.700]  kibaki
[2:11:01.700 --> 2:11:04.700]  and all obama is on the telephone with odinga
[2:11:04.700 --> 2:11:06.700]  even while campaigning
[2:11:06.700 --> 2:11:09.700]  in new hampshire on a daily basis
[2:11:09.700 --> 2:11:11.700]  and obama yet today
[2:11:11.700 --> 2:11:14.700]  despite these massacres against christians
[2:11:14.700 --> 2:11:16.700]  burning fifty christians who were
[2:11:16.700 --> 2:11:18.700]  herded into a church
[2:11:18.700 --> 2:11:21.700]  and the mob wouldn't let them escape they burned down the church with the
[2:11:21.700 --> 2:11:23.700]  people in it
[2:11:23.700 --> 2:11:26.700]  so obama continues to support
[2:11:26.700 --> 2:11:30.700]  odinga will use this wave of violence in order to propel him
[2:11:30.700 --> 2:11:32.700]  from a lost election
[2:11:32.700 --> 2:11:35.700]  into being a power-sharing arrangement where is currently the
[2:11:35.700 --> 2:11:40.700]  prime minister kenya co-president so he supports the campaigns and goes in
[2:11:40.700 --> 2:11:44.700]  campaigns for people that mass murder christians yes shifting gears only get
[2:11:44.700 --> 2:11:46.700]  more into the other points of shifting gears
[2:11:46.700 --> 2:11:49.700]  what about him being for socialized health care what about thousand-dollar
[2:11:49.700 --> 2:11:52.700]  energy credits love all the pay taxes on what about barack obama calling for a
[2:11:52.700 --> 2:11:57.700]  million-person youth brigade to quote gather intelligence and be armed in
[2:11:57.700 --> 2:12:00.700]  the streets of the united states what about the illinois governor who he's
[2:12:00.700 --> 2:12:04.700]  tied in with now coming out and have gun sweeps with a national guard and be
[2:12:04.700 --> 2:12:07.700]  seen as i mean just the policies
[2:12:07.700 --> 2:12:12.700]  radically anti radically anti-second amendment even this famous case tomorrow
[2:12:12.700 --> 2:12:14.700]  and cal and in chicago
[2:12:14.700 --> 2:12:19.700]  uh... going against the right of a gun owner to use his weapon to defend
[2:12:19.700 --> 2:12:22.700]  himself against a burglar in his own home
[2:12:22.700 --> 2:12:26.700]  uh... radically wanting to add double the capital
[2:12:26.700 --> 2:12:29.700]  gains tax which would destroy investment
[2:12:29.700 --> 2:12:31.700]  and dot cut tax revenue
[2:12:31.700 --> 2:12:36.700]  are radically pro-abortion thinking a woman at the right to abortions
[2:12:36.700 --> 2:12:38.700]  so that even if a child but then a
[2:12:38.700 --> 2:12:42.700]  uh... late term in our labor induced abortion
[2:12:42.700 --> 2:12:46.700]  like one of the famous cases in chicago killing a baby that could be adopted
[2:12:46.700 --> 2:12:49.700]  killing a baby i think you know because they had to kill the baby
[2:12:49.700 --> 2:12:52.700]  because the woman has an absolute right to demand an abortion
[2:12:52.700 --> 2:12:56.700]  the baby lives the abortion still kill it
[2:12:56.700 --> 2:13:00.700]  it's it's shocking but it's true and it's on the record
[2:13:00.700 --> 2:13:07.700]  and obama i even quote obama speech in the state legislature on that case
[2:13:07.700 --> 2:13:10.700]  i'm not shocking and then we've got it
[2:13:10.700 --> 2:13:15.700]  all of this goes back to what obama has been lying about from the beginning
[2:13:15.700 --> 2:13:20.700]  which is is radical roots as a socialist with you know even a communist
[2:13:20.700 --> 2:13:22.700]  mentor in high school
[2:13:22.700 --> 2:13:27.700]  sol linsky his involvement with criminal gangs and criminal groups like
[2:13:27.700 --> 2:13:28.700]  resco
[2:13:28.700 --> 2:13:32.700]  uh... with the developer the community developer who would take these low
[2:13:32.700 --> 2:13:34.700]  income housing projects
[2:13:34.700 --> 2:13:36.700]  get loans on them
[2:13:36.700 --> 2:13:40.700]  rape the loans leave the housing projects so poorly redeveloped
[2:13:40.700 --> 2:13:42.700]  that today they're boarded up and on occupied
[2:13:42.700 --> 2:13:45.700]  well obama did the legal work for resco
[2:13:45.700 --> 2:13:49.700]  uh... he uh... allowed if we're going to make campaign contributions to him
[2:13:49.700 --> 2:13:53.700]  and obama even with some of the projects of obama's own district
[2:13:53.700 --> 2:13:57.700]  did nothing to protect the poor people in this district who are being thrown
[2:13:57.700 --> 2:13:58.700]  out of these resco
[2:13:58.700 --> 2:14:03.700]  uninhabitable project okay the book is out today uh... more actually launched
[2:14:03.700 --> 2:14:06.700]  tomorrow officially abomination dr. Jerome coursey
[2:14:06.700 --> 2:14:09.700]  i want to shift gears into totally different subject to get back into obama
[2:14:09.700 --> 2:14:11.700]  and take calls right now dr. coursey
[2:14:11.700 --> 2:14:13.700]  but but but first off
[2:14:13.700 --> 2:14:17.700]  uh... we have the council on foreign relations dr. robert pasture
[2:14:17.700 --> 2:14:20.700]  playing possum saying the n a u is dead
[2:14:20.700 --> 2:14:23.700]  yeah you did a big report on that last week uh... that's the that that that's
[2:14:23.700 --> 2:14:27.700]  possum behavior because here in texas they said three times
[2:14:27.700 --> 2:14:31.700]  that the trans texas nafta trans texas corridor deal is dead and they keep
[2:14:31.700 --> 2:14:32.700]  building it
[2:14:32.700 --> 2:14:35.700]  well in fact if you read passers article very closely
[2:14:35.700 --> 2:14:38.700]  he's just saying that a tactical mistake was made
[2:14:38.700 --> 2:14:41.700]  with the security and prosperity partnership with the bureaucratic working
[2:14:41.700 --> 2:14:42.700]  groups
[2:14:42.700 --> 2:14:46.700]  and when we expose them you know what your show like yours you're in the lead on
[2:14:46.700 --> 2:14:47.700]  this alex
[2:14:47.700 --> 2:14:50.700]  uh... i was writing like great u s a
[2:14:50.700 --> 2:14:53.700]  just the exposure of the bureaucratic working groups meant
[2:14:53.700 --> 2:14:56.700]  that they they couldn't accomplish the behind-the-scenes
[2:14:56.700 --> 2:15:00.700]  you know putting together that it takes mexico and canada so that tactic
[2:15:00.700 --> 2:15:01.700]  failed
[2:15:01.700 --> 2:15:03.700]  but all all that
[2:15:03.700 --> 2:15:04.700]  pastor saying
[2:15:04.700 --> 2:15:09.700]  is let's continue north american integration in a different approach
[2:15:09.700 --> 2:15:12.700]  different you know you want to go to a north american community
[2:15:12.700 --> 2:15:17.700]  to create these institutions like this north american investment fund
[2:15:17.700 --> 2:15:20.700]  for more billions in the mexico to try to
[2:15:20.700 --> 2:15:24.700]  you know up the quality of mexican life so could be more easily integrated
[2:15:24.700 --> 2:15:26.700]  pastor wants to have
[2:15:26.700 --> 2:15:31.700]  biometric border pass cards for trusted trade so he calls an expansion or a
[2:15:31.700 --> 2:15:35.700]  treat is just like working in the knees during the ted offensive claiming it was
[2:15:35.700 --> 2:15:37.700]  a ceasefire he's saying look
[2:15:37.700 --> 2:15:41.700]  we're just going to we got beat on this tactic so we're going to call that
[2:15:41.700 --> 2:15:43.700]  tactic dead
[2:15:43.700 --> 2:15:47.700]  we're going to continue to pursue north american integration now under the
[2:15:47.700 --> 2:15:50.700]  banner of thinking like north americans
[2:15:50.700 --> 2:15:52.700]  classic community
[2:15:52.700 --> 2:15:55.700]  clap which is the other you started classic
[2:15:55.700 --> 2:15:58.700]  uh... military
[2:15:58.700 --> 2:16:03.700]  tactic but methodology name regroup rename come back at it again
[2:16:03.700 --> 2:16:05.700]  that's all this is
[2:16:05.700 --> 2:16:08.700]  this is a regrouping and renaming okay let's go to calls here
[2:16:08.700 --> 2:16:12.700]  uh... let us go ahead and pull my call list up here
[2:16:12.700 --> 2:16:15.700]  let's go ahead and talk to scott in arizona you're on the air
[2:16:15.700 --> 2:16:17.700]  hey guys um...
[2:16:17.700 --> 2:16:19.700]  i'd my question is uh...
[2:16:19.700 --> 2:16:22.700]  and with uh... a proper problem going to the media
[2:16:22.700 --> 2:16:24.700]  with which are of course you
[2:16:24.700 --> 2:16:27.700]  with his book and we're going to be hitting a lot of the major outlet sources
[2:16:27.700 --> 2:16:28.700]  out there
[2:16:28.700 --> 2:16:31.700]  uh... i wonder if he would be able to bring this stuff up during his
[2:16:31.700 --> 2:16:35.700]  interview and uh... you know what they try to edit that out
[2:16:35.700 --> 2:16:38.700]  and uh... i think what you just talked about
[2:16:38.700 --> 2:16:41.700]  uh... what i've been doing very well getting this information out i mean i've
[2:16:41.700 --> 2:16:42.700]  been
[2:16:42.700 --> 2:16:45.700]  on fox and i have several more
[2:16:45.700 --> 2:16:49.700]  radio now you know uh... we've got radio lined up for the entire week and
[2:16:49.700 --> 2:16:50.700]  more television
[2:16:50.700 --> 2:16:54.700]  i won't get on the screening will be no mainstream media
[2:16:54.700 --> 2:16:57.700]  you won't see that's an abc nbc or cbs
[2:16:57.700 --> 2:17:00.700]  you won't see it in the los angeles times of the new york times
[2:17:00.700 --> 2:17:03.700]  they'll poo poo all this or attempt to ignore it
[2:17:03.700 --> 2:17:07.700]  but i think as we demonstrated when i co-authored unfit for command
[2:17:07.700 --> 2:17:10.700]  you know obama's ignoring this at his own peril
[2:17:10.700 --> 2:17:13.700]  because every day they're not commenting the book is becoming a bestseller
[2:17:13.700 --> 2:17:15.700]  and investors
[2:17:15.700 --> 2:17:18.700]  there's gonna be hundreds of thousands of people reading this book out there
[2:17:18.700 --> 2:17:21.700]  before obama said a word in response
[2:17:21.700 --> 2:17:23.700]  the ideas will take hold
[2:17:23.700 --> 2:17:25.700]  the arguments are true
[2:17:25.700 --> 2:17:26.700]  you know i've got
[2:17:26.700 --> 2:17:29.700]  seven hundred footnotes in this book at three hundred sixty pages that's the
[2:17:29.700 --> 2:17:33.700]  same thing it's the same thing with nine eleven truth they ignored us too long
[2:17:33.700 --> 2:17:35.700]  now it's too late for them
[2:17:35.700 --> 2:17:38.700]  and that's gonna be the same thing with us
[2:17:38.700 --> 2:17:41.700]  what we showed in unfit for command and what we're showing here is
[2:17:41.700 --> 2:17:45.700]  that his people get a hold of the truth as they read
[2:17:45.700 --> 2:17:49.700]  the book and see that all the investigation i'm doing in obama's
[2:17:49.700 --> 2:17:50.700]  life
[2:17:50.700 --> 2:17:54.700]  it's true and you know what obama says why didn't know reverend very
[2:17:54.700 --> 2:17:57.700]  reverend right very well that's just not true
[2:17:57.700 --> 2:18:00.700]  he was in the church trinity united for twenty years
[2:18:00.700 --> 2:18:05.700]  and obama's smart enough to have gotten a harvard law degree he knew exactly what black
[2:18:05.700 --> 2:18:09.700]  liberation theology was take another call friends religion it is even among the
[2:18:09.700 --> 2:18:13.700]  african-americans carl and montreal you're on the air with drum course
[2:18:13.700 --> 2:18:18.700]  yeah thank you for taking my call i have a question about obama but i had another
[2:18:18.700 --> 2:18:21.700]  regarding the censorship but the thing about obama i looked at some of the
[2:18:21.700 --> 2:18:25.700]  photographs this past weekend in the newspaper and i know that he was wearing
[2:18:25.700 --> 2:18:30.700]  a bracelet around his right arm with he grew writing on it small writing it's
[2:18:30.700 --> 2:18:34.700]  almost unnoticeable i was wondering if you notice what that is the ball out of
[2:18:34.700 --> 2:18:39.700]  a chronic or cabala i don't know what it is but he started wearing that in
[2:18:39.700 --> 2:18:44.700]  israel some kind of a communication you know obama's wouldn't wear the flag
[2:18:44.700 --> 2:18:48.700]  lapel pen and he made a big deal out of that
[2:18:48.700 --> 2:18:53.700]  wouldn't salute in iowa at one of the when the pledge of allegiance where i
[2:18:53.700 --> 2:18:58.700]  guess that was when the star spangled banner was being sung and obama then
[2:18:58.700 --> 2:19:01.700]  is coming up with this new bracelet i'm sure some kind of secret communication
[2:19:01.700 --> 2:19:06.700]  they think it means something to somebody but obama when you look at obama's
[2:19:06.700 --> 2:19:12.700]  record on israel he's been propelled to the end and anti-israel until now when
[2:19:12.700 --> 2:19:15.700]  he wants to move to the center look like he's a great friend of israel that's
[2:19:15.700 --> 2:19:19.700]  what i call the book leftist politics and called a personality because they're
[2:19:19.700 --> 2:19:24.700]  making up aceratus campaign strategist making this fictional persona for
[2:19:24.700 --> 2:19:29.700]  obama to live in which is not really who obama is
[2:19:29.700 --> 2:19:33.700]  uh... what he is is a ranger um... anything else carl
[2:19:33.700 --> 2:19:37.700]  i had a question later about censorship and i would bring that up i don't
[2:19:37.700 --> 2:19:40.700]  want to bring it up now but regarding censorship that i've experienced
[2:19:40.700 --> 2:19:44.700]  emails that were sent overseas that just never reached your destination

[2:25:06.100 --> 2:25:09.900]  we got a caller that disagrees with you dr. course you don't want to go to him
[2:25:09.900 --> 2:25:15.060]  at the time we've got left here in a moment before we do that
[2:25:15.060 --> 2:25:21.420]  Sy Hirsch has been very accurate said at a media conference that he didn't put
[2:25:21.420 --> 2:25:27.020]  the tails in an article about chaining wanting pre-textures to attack Iran but
[2:25:27.020 --> 2:25:32.180]  that they but the Cheney proposed just a few months ago creating fake Iranian PT
[2:25:32.180 --> 2:25:36.500]  patrol boats having Navy SEALs armed have an engagement quote a shootout with
[2:25:36.500 --> 2:25:40.780]  larger vessels US vessels a were you aware of that and be what your take on
[2:25:40.780 --> 2:25:46.180]  it my take I think the bad idea I was not aware of it but I mean didn't we try
[2:25:46.180 --> 2:25:49.820]  that in the Tonkin Gulf already once I mean do we need to go that routine again
[2:25:49.820 --> 2:25:53.580]  it's pretty transparent I think if anybody were to try that it would be
[2:25:53.580 --> 2:25:58.220]  laughed at and laughed out of Congress immediately I don't think these are
[2:25:58.220 --> 2:26:03.420]  patrol boats the Iranians have had have been on nearly as serious yes our
[2:26:03.420 --> 2:26:07.460]  commanders have to after the coal was attacked be cautious that their ships
[2:26:07.460 --> 2:26:11.860]  are not attacked but I don't think the Iranian ships in the Gulf are anything
[2:26:11.860 --> 2:26:16.380]  more than a nuisance well point is it's a big deal they're talking about a
[2:26:16.380 --> 2:26:19.180]  changing look I've been I've been saying for some time that the Bush
[2:26:19.180 --> 2:26:23.580]  administration was ready for a war in Iran I've been arguing against the war
[2:26:23.580 --> 2:26:29.620]  since 2005 when I wrote atomic Iran and walked for 200 miles with the Iranian
[2:26:29.620 --> 2:26:32.740]  freedom fighters trying to change their own country through peaceful means
[2:26:32.740 --> 2:26:37.300]  without will strengthen the hardliners yes well you know the whole idea of a
[2:26:37.300 --> 2:26:43.300]  lot of you know a false flag attack launched in order to generate a war is
[2:26:43.300 --> 2:26:47.100]  reprehensible and should not even be contemplated ever let's talk to let's
[2:26:47.100 --> 2:26:50.460]  talk to run in Arizona Ron you're on the air go ahead

[2:27:04.980 --> 2:27:06.700]  Obama
[2:27:06.700 --> 2:27:11.060]  america has a choice in the next twelve years of a
[2:27:11.060 --> 2:27:12.820]  McCain for four years
[2:27:12.820 --> 2:27:15.100]  Hillary for eight years for which means
[2:27:15.100 --> 2:27:16.980]  twelve more years
[2:27:16.980 --> 2:27:20.180]  of daddy bush administration
[2:27:20.180 --> 2:27:21.740]  or
[2:27:21.740 --> 2:27:24.940]  or bomber for eight years and then a republican
[2:27:24.940 --> 2:27:26.700]  for eight years now
[2:27:26.700 --> 2:27:30.300]  which would you rather have mr. Corky
[2:27:30.300 --> 2:27:31.700]  alex jones
[2:27:31.700 --> 2:27:34.940]  would you rather have mccain in hillary
[2:27:34.940 --> 2:27:37.260]  or or bomber someone
[2:27:37.260 --> 2:27:40.340]  who we could stand up to and say hey

[2:27:59.900 --> 2:28:02.660]  i'm with joseph era none of the above
[2:28:02.660 --> 2:28:04.260]  i mean the third you know it

[2:34:23.140 --> 2:34:26.620]  the men are totally compromised and bought and paid for by the new world
[2:34:26.620 --> 2:34:32.460]  order I have supported Ron Paul now I'm supporting a constitution party and
[2:34:32.460 --> 2:34:38.860]  Chuck Baldwin but Barack Obama is a liar he has called for new world war until
[2:34:38.860 --> 2:34:42.980]  we all have to serve it as slaves basically that queue that up queue that

[2:35:07.660 --> 2:35:13.820]  interview to dr. Corsi admitting they staged terror attacks and going on this
[2:35:13.820 --> 2:35:17.300]  show and others and saying 9-11 may have been an inside job I mean they're
[2:35:17.300 --> 2:35:23.340]  having to capitulate to the facts we are winning we are becoming mainstream the
[2:35:23.340 --> 2:35:26.340]  new world order is in trouble they're North American unions in trouble the
[2:35:26.340 --> 2:35:35.220]  European unions in trouble being voted out from the Netherlands to France to
[2:35:35.220 --> 2:35:38.980]  Ireland does that mean we're still not in deep trouble in the fight of our
[2:35:38.980 --> 2:35:43.620]  lives absolutely not things are serious but we have to get winner
[2:35:43.620 --> 2:35:48.460]  mentalities and mentalities of being winners and taking this country and this
[2:35:48.460 --> 2:35:54.260]  planet back for liberty now now here's the Barack Obama clip for anybody who
[2:35:54.260 --> 2:35:57.180]  doesn't understand what's happening this is him in Germany basically saying
[2:35:57.180 --> 2:36:00.940]  we're slaves the global government we have to give more we have to do what
[2:36:00.940 --> 2:36:05.700]  they say here it is well there have been extraordinary scenes in Berlin tonight
[2:36:05.700 --> 2:36:10.620]  as thousands of people gathered to hear Barack Obama deliver key foreign policy
[2:36:10.620 --> 2:36:14.860]  speech on his current European tour the Democratic presidential hopeful laid out
[2:36:14.860 --> 2:36:19.620]  his vision for America's place in a new world order saying he was speaking as a
[2:36:19.620 --> 2:36:23.980]  proud citizen of the United States and a fellow citizen of the world while
[2:36:23.980 --> 2:36:27.780]  Senator Obama's tackled America's place in the world at several points in his
[2:36:27.780 --> 2:36:32.020]  speech acknowledging recent splits between the US and the rest of the
[2:36:32.020 --> 2:36:37.260]  international community in Europe the view that America is part of what has
[2:36:37.260 --> 2:36:42.220]  gone wrong in our world rather than a force to help us make it right has
[2:36:42.220 --> 2:36:48.180]  become all too common yes there have been differences between America and
[2:36:48.180 --> 2:36:54.380]  Europe no doubt there will be differences in the future but the burdens of
[2:36:54.380 --> 2:37:00.540]  global citizenship continue to bind us together a change of leadership in
[2:37:00.540 --> 2:37:06.340]  Washington will not lift this burden in this new century Americans and Europeans
[2:37:06.340 --> 2:37:13.380]  alike will be required to do more partnership and cooperation among
[2:37:13.380 --> 2:37:20.940]  nations is not a choice it is the only way the one way to protect our common
[2:37:20.940 --> 2:37:25.980]  security and advance our common humanity
[2:37:25.980 --> 2:37:36.620]  the left is defending that speech they are defending it saying well Ronald
[2:37:36.620 --> 2:37:38.940]  Reagan called for that will George Bush senior called for that
[2:37:38.940 --> 2:37:44.260]  absolutely it's nonpartisan that was his I'm bought and paid for by the man I'm
[2:37:44.260 --> 2:37:50.380]  owned by the new world order so get this straight I stand against John McCain I
[2:37:50.380 --> 2:37:55.060]  stand against Barack Obama I could care less the color of the melanin in their
[2:37:55.060 --> 2:38:04.900]  skin I could care less I care about the content of their minds and those of you
[2:38:04.900 --> 2:38:08.380]  there in this love affair with Barack Obama you're going to find out that
[2:38:08.380 --> 2:38:15.500]  he's a ringer you're going to find out he's there to fall flat on his face he's
[2:38:15.500 --> 2:38:20.300]  there to wreck any chance we ever have of having a black president in the near
[2:38:20.300 --> 2:38:27.220]  future or even in the long term he is creating more division than he's
[2:38:27.220 --> 2:38:33.380]  creating unity get past it he's a puppet the the the Democratic Republican
[2:38:33.380 --> 2:38:37.900]  conventions the parties all of it at the national level is a distraction and
[2:38:37.900 --> 2:38:42.820]  diversion it is a curtain that skirts the real world the real power structure
[2:38:42.820 --> 2:38:46.460]  and we're still having to have debates with the American people about whether
[2:38:46.460 --> 2:38:50.280]  there's a plan for a world government or a North American Union or an EU when
[2:38:50.280 --> 2:38:57.260]  they're in our face staring us down it's so childlike to even have these
[2:38:57.260 --> 2:39:02.660]  debates it doesn't matter people say well we don't want another eight years of
[2:39:02.660 --> 2:39:05.860]  Bush senior basically running things through whoever through McCain or
[2:39:05.860 --> 2:39:09.460]  Clinton it doesn't matter they're just puppets to you think George Bush senior
[2:39:09.460 --> 2:39:15.100]  runs anything he's a super gopher for the big banks for the military industrial
[2:39:15.100 --> 2:39:22.180]  complex for the oil companies for British intelligence from Assad when you
[2:39:22.180 --> 2:39:24.860]  get to the highest levels of global government when they have car law group
[2:39:24.860 --> 2:39:29.540]  functions and Bilderberg group meetings and Bohemian Grove and trial
[2:39:29.540 --> 2:39:33.660]  lateral commission meetings there's Arabs there's Jews there's Catholics there's
[2:39:33.660 --> 2:39:39.420]  Protestants there's royalty they're all there folks and it's a game against us
[2:39:39.420 --> 2:39:44.140]  it's a system against us it's a program against us the people let's just grow
[2:39:44.140 --> 2:39:48.860]  up and get that through our heads because then we can get past the foil
[2:39:48.860 --> 2:39:55.380]  past the shield past the front and get into some reality
[2:40:01.340 --> 2:40:05.540]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls Fred JJ Trevor Doug and Zach and then I'm gonna
[2:40:05.540 --> 2:40:11.220]  play a seven-minute newscast to analyze it and comment on it and I see these in
[2:40:11.220 --> 2:40:18.540]  regional news in Kansas and in Texas and Illinois and New York Florida I've
[2:40:18.540 --> 2:40:26.580]  seen more than 30 40 reports over the last couple years where troops are sent
[2:40:26.580 --> 2:40:31.140]  in to clean up do you and then you'll have a group of a hundred plus men and
[2:40:31.140 --> 2:40:35.020]  almost all of them died the others are barely alive they've all got cancers in
[2:40:35.020 --> 2:40:40.140]  their nasal passages in their lungs when they're 25 30 years old 18 years old they
[2:40:40.140 --> 2:40:46.500]  come home they're in a wheelchair in a week in a month they're on a dialysis
[2:40:46.500 --> 2:40:54.260]  six months later they're on a respirator and then they go in the ground
[2:40:55.540 --> 2:41:01.340]  you know I told the story let's just play this now and then we'll go to your
[2:41:01.340 --> 2:41:06.980]  calls it's too important I told the story of last year last August I was
[2:41:06.980 --> 2:41:11.860]  showing in-game a month before it was released on DVD
[2:41:12.660 --> 2:41:25.060]  at the Alamo draft house on South Lamar and a man who is the head press person
[2:41:25.060 --> 2:41:28.740]  for Governor Rick Perry comes up to me and I recognize him from TV and he a
[2:41:28.740 --> 2:41:32.740]  little tear in his eye so there was wife and he said Alex I want you to know I
[2:41:32.740 --> 2:41:35.100]  worked at Fort Sam Houston I know you've heard this story but for those that
[2:41:35.100 --> 2:41:37.900]  haven't I'm gonna tell it again he goes I worked at Fort Sam Houston and they
[2:41:37.900 --> 2:41:44.500]  sent down I think he said for special forces guys from Fort Bragg and the
[2:41:44.500 --> 2:41:47.420]  base gave them shots and we were there to watch what happened to him and they
[2:41:47.420 --> 2:41:51.260]  all died and then we had to decontaminate the whole the whole wing of that
[2:41:51.260 --> 2:41:56.700]  facility with chemicals and bleach and they took it all outside and scrubbed it
[2:41:56.700 --> 2:42:03.220]  Ian has mad outfits because in the film we spent 20 minutes showing all the
[2:42:03.220 --> 2:42:05.580]  mainstream news where they would take little children and radiate them to
[2:42:05.580 --> 2:42:09.780]  death in the US and Israel where they would in England spread their
[2:42:09.780 --> 2:42:12.580]  populations with deadly chemicals biological radiological killing people
[2:42:12.580 --> 2:42:16.380]  in many cases marching troops in a gas chambers nerve-gassing our own troops
[2:42:16.380 --> 2:42:19.580]  telling their families they died of the flu
[2:42:19.580 --> 2:42:26.020]  sarin VX that's who runs things and you can't get away from it you can't get
[2:42:26.020 --> 2:42:29.340]  around it you can't get around the fact that it's now mainstream news because
[2:42:29.340 --> 2:42:33.620]  you the listeners pushing it out there that's why they're so desperate to
[2:42:33.620 --> 2:42:36.580]  shut down prison planet dot com and info wars dot common censor all over the
[2:42:36.580 --> 2:42:42.540]  world in different ways because you the listeners it's to stop you not me I'm
[2:42:42.540 --> 2:42:45.820]  basically like you know they snap the ball to me I place it you're the kicker
[2:42:45.820 --> 2:42:49.860]  you kick it through the goalpost because you pushed it out Thursday and
[2:42:49.860 --> 2:42:52.820]  Friday where Keith Oberman and others ended up care covering the fact that
[2:42:52.820 --> 2:42:57.100]  Dick Cheney wanted to kill US Navy personnel by staging an attack with
[2:42:57.100 --> 2:43:04.060]  Navy Seals dressed up like Iranians in boats built to look identical to look
[2:43:04.060 --> 2:43:08.860]  the same as Iranian PT boats you think they like the fact that you punch that
[2:43:08.860 --> 2:43:14.740]  out on the mainstream news you think they're happy about that you think I'm
[2:43:14.740 --> 2:43:18.580]  not in danger doing stuff like that being in this position I don't know
[2:43:18.580 --> 2:43:23.580]  anybody else that can do what we do here and I thank God every day I'm still
[2:43:23.580 --> 2:43:29.260]  above the ground because they don't care about me one bit my life means nothing
[2:43:29.260 --> 2:43:32.500]  they don't want to kill me right now because they know it'll only make me
[2:43:32.500 --> 2:43:36.140]  bigger but they can shut my websites down and discredit me they will kill me
[2:43:36.140 --> 2:43:39.420]  and I don't want to die I want to be here for my wife and my children I want
[2:43:39.420 --> 2:43:43.140]  to see them grow up I want to see them have children I am not afraid of dying
[2:43:43.140 --> 2:43:47.140]  I'm not afraid of somebody when I'm walking around in my yard at night
[2:43:47.140 --> 2:43:51.420]  walking the dog throwing a tourniquet around my neck and choking me out and
[2:43:51.420 --> 2:43:55.980]  killing me I'm not afraid of being shot but I am angry and I don't want to have
[2:43:55.980 --> 2:43:59.900]  my future stolen from me because I have got things I want to do personally in my
[2:43:59.900 --> 2:44:04.660]  life oil paintings I want to do people I want to take care of and love like my
[2:44:04.660 --> 2:44:10.140]  grandmother there's a great grandmother to my children and my family but I
[2:44:10.140 --> 2:44:13.300]  dedicate almost every waking hour of this fight I got home at one o'clock the
[2:44:13.300 --> 2:44:19.420]  morning last night because I know it's my responsibility and I know I'm in the
[2:44:19.420 --> 2:44:27.740]  position to do what I do and I know without a shadow of a doubt that they
[2:44:27.740 --> 2:44:34.180]  implant every single servicemen in our military with highly aggressive cancer
[2:44:34.180 --> 2:44:38.700]  viruses that are connected just in one class of the shots they're giving them
[2:44:38.700 --> 2:44:42.540]  we've had top scientists medical doctors virologist on epidemiologist on about
[2:44:42.540 --> 2:44:46.980]  it and it's even been in the class by government documents that are triggered
[2:44:46.980 --> 2:44:50.460]  during certain hormonal fluctuations in the body when your hormone level goes
[2:44:50.460 --> 2:44:57.700]  down as a man or a woman they then attack sexual tissues in the body where
[2:44:57.700 --> 2:45:02.860]  those hormone exchanges are made the testicles the breast the pituitary gland
[2:45:02.860 --> 2:45:09.060]  the hypothalamus you see all these young movie stars dying of cancer now and
[2:45:09.060 --> 2:45:12.780]  it grows and grows they make it into a fad and a pageant all these fake anti
[2:45:12.780 --> 2:45:16.620]  cancer movements everybody getting into it to oh it's so wonderful everybody
[2:45:16.620 --> 2:45:20.340]  get you know it's so cute we're all together we survive cancer it's designed
[2:45:20.340 --> 2:45:25.860]  to kill you like carousel and Logan's run when you get above the age of 45 and
[2:45:25.860 --> 2:45:33.020]  it isn't a joke and it's not a game and it's real it's eugenics you never see
[2:45:33.020 --> 2:45:35.500]  the type of report you're about to hear in national news it's always
[2:45:35.500 --> 2:45:38.860]  compartmentalized where local media cares enough to have a local doctor or
[2:45:38.860 --> 2:45:43.300]  local scientist or military on who are dying who are being killed who are being
[2:45:43.300 --> 2:45:53.140]  maimed by these shots please don't laugh at the military we have evidence they're
[2:45:53.140 --> 2:45:58.180]  giving the police these shots do not laugh at me officers I care about you
[2:45:58.180 --> 2:46:04.420]  even if you're dumb I used to be dumb too and I love you and I get angry by how
[2:46:04.420 --> 2:46:08.180]  stupid you are you think you've been given all this power you think you're
[2:46:08.180 --> 2:46:11.300]  allowed to go out and do all these bad things and that you're shielded from it
[2:46:11.300 --> 2:46:15.500]  your masters hate you more than they hate me
[2:46:21.620 --> 2:46:26.500]  just play the clip and I'll comment on it after just play it vaccines are
[2:46:26.500 --> 2:46:29.780]  required if you're headed to war but target five discovered that a frightening
[2:46:29.780 --> 2:46:34.620]  number of US servicemen and women are having severe reactions including a
[2:46:34.620 --> 2:46:41.260]  young marine from Claremont County it's difficult right now at a time when
[2:46:41.260 --> 2:46:49.620]  young men and women are dying on the battlefield there is an enemy here at
[2:46:49.620 --> 2:46:56.100]  home no one wants to look bad it's not a shot from a gun this is the worst cover
[2:46:56.100 --> 2:47:01.820]  of it in the history of the military but a shot from a syringe that's leaving
[2:47:01.820 --> 2:47:07.580]  some US servicemen and women on the brink of death when the issue I believe of
[2:47:07.580 --> 2:47:14.860]  the use of the vaccine comes out I believe it'll make the Walter Reed
[2:47:14.860 --> 2:47:22.780]  scandal pale in comparison it's an exhausting three-day a week routine for
[2:47:22.780 --> 2:47:27.420]  20 year old Lance Corporal David Fay of Claremont County his kidneys are
[2:47:27.420 --> 2:47:32.380]  failing his military career is over and he feels like his country has abandoned
[2:47:32.380 --> 2:47:36.860]  him I can't look at my old pictures I really can't I start looking at my
[2:47:36.860 --> 2:47:42.020]  old pictures and I start crying to understand the odyssey of David Fay
[2:47:42.020 --> 2:47:48.300]  requires going back in time he was a boy who loved the ocean but grew up
[2:47:48.300 --> 2:47:52.380]  amid the farm fields of Claremont County I never missed a day school I was
[2:47:52.380 --> 2:47:58.060]  never sick I was never sick a passion for sports in a sense of patriotism
[2:47:58.060 --> 2:48:02.780]  prompted this Blanchester High School athlete to join the Marines on his 18th
[2:48:02.780 --> 2:48:06.540]  birthday and I looked at every branch but I wanted the Marine Corps because the
[2:48:06.540 --> 2:48:10.700]  Marine Corps was a few of the problem from boot camp to combat training it was
[2:48:10.700 --> 2:48:15.340]  the happiest time of his life it was great I loved every minute of it but a
[2:48:15.340 --> 2:48:20.220]  case of friendly fire in the form of a syringe would forever change his life on
[2:48:20.220 --> 2:48:26.060]  November 28th of 2005 David's unit was lined up for what he says was an
[2:48:26.060 --> 2:48:30.660]  undisclosed shot they asked us our name we stood on these yellow footprints and
[2:48:30.660 --> 2:48:36.100]  they gave us the shot then we got the rest of the day off after that shot I
[2:48:36.100 --> 2:48:40.780]  started swelling up I gained 30 pounds of water in my eyes swat up where I
[2:48:40.780 --> 2:48:45.420]  couldn't see I started snoring I developed a rash on my hand three weeks
[2:48:45.420 --> 2:48:50.260]  later private Faye was back in Claremont County on his deathbed at Clinton
[2:48:50.260 --> 2:48:55.300]  Memorial Hospital his kidneys failing his body so swollen it left
[2:48:55.300 --> 2:49:00.300]  stretch marks I'm used to just pray to God please taking the night as David
[2:49:00.300 --> 2:49:04.540]  appeared to be dying Cindy Faye began pouring over his military medical
[2:49:04.540 --> 2:49:10.500]  records in search of answers the shot was never listed in his records as the
[2:49:10.500 --> 2:49:15.500]  months passed by David's uniform would hang in the closet while his life would
[2:49:15.500 --> 2:49:20.420]  hang in the balance still unclear about the shot he was given on November 28th
[2:49:20.420 --> 2:49:25.780]  of 2005 the Department of Defense tells target five all service members
[2:49:25.780 --> 2:49:29.700]  vaccinations are documented in the individual's permanent medical record
[2:49:29.700 --> 2:49:34.060]  but David Faye's military medical records revealed no shot on that day
[2:49:34.060 --> 2:49:38.820]  another Marine and David's unit tells target five there's no shot listed in
[2:49:38.820 --> 2:49:43.300]  his medical records either and goes on to say the people who administered the
[2:49:43.300 --> 2:49:50.220]  shot never told us what it was my son is a Marine a PFC David Faye in a
[2:49:50.220 --> 2:49:55.060]  desperate attempt to save her dying son Cindy says she called the US Marine
[2:49:55.060 --> 2:50:00.380]  Hospital at 29 Palms California to find out what kind of vaccine her son was
[2:50:00.380 --> 2:50:03.780]  given and she says ma'am that's confidential I can't tell you what the
[2:50:03.780 --> 2:50:08.460]  shot was and I you know I'm like well my son's in ICU and he might not make it
[2:50:08.460 --> 2:50:13.860]  right now I said I really need to know and she says well we can't tell you 11
[2:50:13.860 --> 2:50:18.260]  months later David's medical records were mysteriously changed with a hand
[2:50:18.260 --> 2:50:23.340]  written notation indicating the mystery shot was a flu vaccine the case of David
[2:50:23.340 --> 2:50:28.460]  Faye nothing was put on his record and then suddenly flu vaccine appears on
[2:50:28.460 --> 2:50:32.580]  his record stop right there back it up a little bit when we come back we'll play

[2:56:01.540 --> 2:56:06.620]  girls the shot they are testing chemical and biological weapons operations
[2:56:06.620 --> 2:56:11.100]  against us finish up with the clap ladies and gentlemen here it is 11
[2:56:11.100 --> 2:56:15.500]  months later David's medical records were mysteriously changed with a hand
[2:56:15.500 --> 2:56:20.620]  written notation indicating the mystery shot was a flu vaccine the case of David
[2:56:20.620 --> 2:56:25.820]  pay nothing was put on his record and then suddenly flu vaccine appears on his
[2:56:25.820 --> 2:56:32.460]  record does that surprise you no no we have a lovely term for that we call it
[2:56:32.460 --> 2:56:42.540]  CYA that's a unfortunately an SOP in the military David is one of a growing
[2:56:42.540 --> 2:56:47.180]  number of US servicemen and women getting sick after receiving vaccines and
[2:56:47.180 --> 2:56:52.180]  this highly praised Department of Defense medical officer is mortified he
[2:56:52.180 --> 2:56:56.220]  doesn't want to be identified for fear of retribution are there a lot of folks
[2:56:56.220 --> 2:57:02.220]  out there who've had severe reactions to these vaccines thousands ranging on a
[2:57:02.220 --> 2:57:09.820]  severity from just joining some pains and arthritic symptoms to death the
[2:57:09.820 --> 2:57:13.700]  Department of Defense tells target five it encourages healthcare workers and
[2:57:13.700 --> 2:57:19.020]  vaccine recipients to report adverse events but the military never reported
[2:57:19.020 --> 2:57:24.220]  David phase reaction to the Centers for Disease Control and FDA I see the way
[2:57:24.220 --> 2:57:31.060]  propaganda and information war is waged against America's sons and daughters
[2:57:31.060 --> 2:57:36.780]  and how patients are treated who claim to be ill from a vaccine that's troubling
[2:57:36.780 --> 2:57:40.700]  that should trouble America how are these young men and women treated when
[2:57:40.700 --> 2:57:47.260]  they claim to have had a reaction to the vaccine like their nuts like it's all
[2:57:47.260 --> 2:57:51.340]  in their head and this medical officer believes young servicemen and women are
[2:57:51.340 --> 2:57:57.460]  being used as guinea pigs do you believe that the Department of Defense is
[2:57:57.460 --> 2:58:04.620]  experimenting on these servicemen and women with these vaccinations I would
[2:58:04.620 --> 2:58:09.140]  hope to God not from what I've seen I would have to say yes the Department of
[2:58:09.140 --> 2:58:14.540]  Defense maintains the vaccines are safe and effective those are hollow words to
[2:58:14.540 --> 2:58:20.980]  Lance Corporal David Fay I'm in bed every single minute of the day I can't eat
[2:58:20.980 --> 2:58:28.100]  because I throw up I have no energy I've been laying in bed and bedroom for so

[3:01:43.180 --> 3:01:48.100]  hospice and you can die and they can come with a flag and maybe give you a
[3:01:48.100 --> 3:01:52.340]  multiple salute and then bury your body and then use your patriotism to sell

[3:02:04.660 --> 3:02:08.180]  gotten to yet we'll be covering Fred and Philly finishing up with a point you
[3:02:08.180 --> 3:02:13.740]  had earlier go ahead yeah well you know I'm a supporter of Dr. Corsi of you and
[3:02:13.740 --> 3:02:23.180]  the and all the good people on the network my point is that you still
[3:02:23.180 --> 3:02:30.820]  have to judge the things that he is saying according to a proper method a
[3:02:30.820 --> 3:02:37.340]  scientific method he has to basically indicate where he's coming from and if
[3:02:37.340 --> 3:02:43.980]  you know Dr. Corsi as you do it seems well I've never met him in person he's a
[3:02:43.980 --> 3:02:48.940]  guest on the radio show well it seems it seems as though he's brilliant but he
[3:02:48.940 --> 3:02:54.980]  doesn't he have a theocratic point of view a lot of sure I said on there I
[3:02:54.980 --> 3:02:57.740]  don't agree with a lot of things drum of course he has he was a guest on the show
[3:02:57.740 --> 3:03:05.060]  but but you know I kind of like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts philosophy better
[3:03:05.060 --> 3:03:09.500]  because he absolutely I totally agree with him look I appreciate your call I
[3:03:09.500 --> 3:03:13.220]  thought you had other subjects you want to bring up I I mean I don't endorse
[3:03:13.220 --> 3:03:18.860]  everything about every guest I have on you know I mean they're hitting us with
[3:03:18.860 --> 3:03:22.660]  chemical biological radiological attacks they're spraying the air poisoning
[3:03:22.660 --> 3:03:27.780]  the water and we're sitting here talking about Dr. Corsi I just don't know what
[3:03:27.780 --> 3:03:31.180]  to do anymore it just sometimes it just totally makes me go crazy don't you
[3:03:31.180 --> 3:03:35.620]  understand we're all under attack here info wars and present planet are getting
[3:03:35.620 --> 3:03:40.220]  censored all over the place everywhere so we're talking about drone Corsi all
[3:03:40.220 --> 3:03:46.700]  day JJ in Florida you're on the air come on JJ you're on the air hi Alex
[3:03:46.700 --> 3:03:53.620]  actually this is Jeremy I'm sorry from Alaska I just you will click I'm a huge
[3:03:53.620 --> 3:03:57.780]  fan of yours and quite a few other people like Jordan Maxwell and Tex
[3:03:57.780 --> 3:04:03.500]  Mars and William Cooper and Al Neil and Dr. Kenovan I had this major strange
[3:04:03.500 --> 3:04:09.020]  connection I found is between people that believe in evolution believe that
[3:04:09.020 --> 3:04:15.340]  9-11 wasn't an inside job and it was kind of sad but I broke down quite a few
[3:04:15.340 --> 3:04:20.500]  college boys and they told me that a truth is not based off of evidence or
[3:04:20.500 --> 3:04:26.900]  fact and I was like wow I guess there's no helping you then but what I wanted to
[3:04:26.900 --> 3:04:32.420]  challenge you on was I was wondering if we could try to help people understand
[3:04:32.420 --> 3:04:36.500]  that there is something really wrong with the federal education and it has a
[3:04:36.500 --> 3:04:42.340]  lot to do with this programing that there is no God I mean it's it's kind of
[3:04:42.340 --> 3:04:48.180]  really helping you know this socialistic movement move forward that we need help
[3:04:48.180 --> 3:04:53.140]  from our government instead of our own there's no God all the old morals can
[3:04:53.140 --> 3:04:55.700]  be thrown out so it's okay for the government to kill who they want when
[3:04:55.700 --> 3:04:58.820]  they want doctors don't have the Hippocratic oath anymore you're absolutely
[3:04:58.820 --> 3:05:03.940]  right yeah and I just wanted to see if you can put out that guy I can't hold and
[3:05:03.940 --> 3:05:08.100]  they put him in jail for like 200 years and all he was talking was why you can
[3:05:08.100 --> 3:05:14.740]  truth and your phone's so bad it's just unbelievably horrible who doctor can't
[3:05:14.740 --> 3:05:22.940]  hold it you say hoping all right well we'll just end that call there all
[3:05:22.940 --> 3:05:27.820]  right we'll be right back with more of your calls oh god help us we'll be right

[3:08:35.740 --> 3:08:41.820]  political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[3:08:41.820 --> 3:08:49.540]  continuing with your phone calls Trevor and West Virginia you're on the year
[3:08:49.540 --> 3:08:55.860]  oh hi yes okay I just want to give a few tips about what we could do to avoid
[3:08:55.860 --> 3:08:59.900]  internet well I feel like we're going to have a trip seems more like a last-ditch
[3:08:59.900 --> 3:09:03.700]  effort here but other few things that you look up to just like video capture
[3:09:03.700 --> 3:09:07.140]  programs that you can look up look up and they can actually capture the sound
[3:09:07.140 --> 3:09:11.220]  you can go to YouTube and look up the videos or better yet just go to a
[3:09:11.220 --> 3:09:14.700]  government website and print out some regulations being passed by US Army
[3:09:14.700 --> 3:09:21.500]  relation US-210 civilian inmate labor programs or up to the PED 51 that you
[3:09:21.500 --> 3:09:27.740]  mentioned earlier and there I like your idea of a freedom to earlier when you
[3:09:27.740 --> 3:09:31.460]  had up we're talking about there needs to be something like YouTube for people
[3:09:31.460 --> 3:09:34.580]  who are just trying to wake people up and I know that when I go to your website
[3:09:34.580 --> 3:09:38.580]  or when your website there's a link to YouTube and I thought you might want to
[3:09:38.580 --> 3:09:43.340]  try hire some more people and yeah we can't afford to have a YouTube it's so
[3:09:43.340 --> 3:09:48.500]  expensive I mean I'm gonna put a video link of my hour and a half rant I did
[3:09:48.500 --> 3:09:51.220]  at the start of the show about the censorship of prison planet by the
[3:09:51.220 --> 3:09:55.180]  British government and just to put that up free for a day to try to get it out
[3:09:55.180 --> 3:09:59.740]  so people can use the clips of that will could potentially cost us thousands
[3:09:59.740 --> 3:10:06.940]  of dollars again it's a rigged game and and we need to stop the censorship
[3:10:06.940 --> 3:10:12.420]  itself not try to get around it because the internet needs to be used as a
[3:10:12.420 --> 3:10:16.540]  viral tool to reach people that haven't been reached who don't know how to get
[3:10:16.540 --> 3:10:21.460]  around all this stuff so we're dealing with massive censorship the web is
[3:10:21.460 --> 3:10:25.260]  being shut down everywhere I appreciate your call Doug in Florida you're on the
[3:10:25.260 --> 3:10:32.500]  year Alex yes how you doing I'm a first-time caller long-time listener I've
[3:10:32.500 --> 3:10:35.380]  been following your research and everything since you started in this
[3:10:35.380 --> 3:10:41.060]  document I started putting some of your documentaries the clips on my site and
[3:10:41.060 --> 3:10:45.380]  you know we were talking directly through email and you'd like that idea and
[3:10:45.380 --> 3:10:50.340]  stuff that's when it went took it from there but uh I just had a it's kind of
[3:10:50.340 --> 3:10:54.980]  off topic and everything but had an idea that it's probably already been thought
[3:10:54.980 --> 3:11:01.100]  of as far as like an energy revolution where if we could get some of your
[3:11:01.100 --> 3:11:05.700]  contacts you know that are willing to put together a device and get it out to
[3:11:05.700 --> 3:11:10.700]  the people eat quickly and easily and cheaply where we can you know stop buying
[3:11:10.700 --> 3:11:15.260]  but I can't do anymore I'm doing everything I can every solution and
[3:11:15.260 --> 3:11:18.740]  tells what Alex Jones does the solution is looking you right in the mirror
[3:11:18.740 --> 3:11:22.860]  brother oh yeah well I've been I've been waking people up daily man I've been
[3:11:22.860 --> 3:11:26.380]  doing it yeah I think we need to also understand that we may not always have
[3:11:26.380 --> 3:11:30.340]  the internet and that we need to go low-tech while we do high-tech things
[3:11:30.340 --> 3:11:35.300]  as well like get truth rising or in game or tear storm and make good old-fashioned
[3:11:35.300 --> 3:11:42.260]  DVD copies of that sucker and believe me I just you know if somebody had the

[3:11:46.300 --> 3:11:50.660]  be an energy revolution without even firing a shot well a lot of people are
[3:11:50.660 --> 3:11:54.220]  working on that know some of that is being phased in I appreciate your call
[3:11:54.220 --> 3:12:03.860]  look the big solution here is discrediting the New World Order on record

[3:12:09.860 --> 3:12:14.380]  public test criminals run our government doesn't matter what administration
[3:12:14.380 --> 3:12:18.860]  they're just puppets that have set the precedent to have a large military and
[3:12:18.860 --> 3:12:24.740]  industrial complex that puts poison in our food and water that sprays us that
[3:12:24.740 --> 3:12:29.300]  puts poisons in vaccines it's bankrupt it's totally criminal we have to
[3:12:29.300 --> 3:12:33.460]  discredit the global government we have to get back to local government we have
[3:12:33.460 --> 3:12:37.660]  to shrink the size of government instead of free thousand dollar gas credit
[3:12:37.660 --> 3:12:42.300]  which isn't free got to pay taxes for that or free bailouts on housing which
[3:12:42.300 --> 3:12:47.060]  further bankrupts things of the bankers or just all of it and the police have
[3:12:47.060 --> 3:12:49.660]  to realize that the system is criminal and that they're being used as the
[3:12:49.660 --> 3:12:53.980]  enforcers to carry out a bunch of unconstitutional bull and the government
[3:12:53.980 --> 3:12:58.860]  is hiring mercenaries and criminals and foreigners to fill their ranks all of
[3:12:58.860 --> 3:13:04.460]  this classical tyranny but I hear you Doug and I appreciate your call I mean

[3:24:35.340 --> 3:24:53.900]  it doesn't happen very often
[3:24:53.900 --> 3:24:57.180]  but listening to how they kill the troops with these injections by design
[3:24:57.180 --> 3:25:02.140]  and to hear how they make excuses for it and how it's all compartmentalized
[3:25:02.140 --> 3:25:06.940]  and how the nurses say we're not going to tell you what you were given
[3:25:06.940 --> 3:25:10.940]  it shakes me up i think about my children i think about how they live in a
[3:25:10.940 --> 3:25:15.980]  world with people running it we just want to murder them
[3:25:19.420 --> 3:25:24.300]  and then sometimes i can't even reach down to the anger anymore that burns

[3:33:58.460 --> 3:34:03.500]  ron paul was on with us for 30 minutes he talked about the stage cheney deal we
[3:34:03.500 --> 3:34:06.140]  educated him on that i played the clip he talked about government sponsored
[3:34:06.140 --> 3:34:10.380]  terrorism that restarts whenever the show ends for
[3:34:10.380 --> 3:34:12.860]  internet listeners they're trying to censor us the
[3:34:12.860 --> 3:34:15.580]  british government censoring as it's all documented
[3:34:15.580 --> 3:34:18.620]  i've launched a big contest to try to expose this
[3:34:18.620 --> 3:34:24.060]  close to 14 000 and prizes that's what money is therefore to be
[3:34:24.060 --> 3:34:27.820]  literally burned in the fight against the new world order
[3:34:27.820 --> 3:34:30.860]  so i launched that to about to 30 minutes into the show to be able to
[3:34:30.860 --> 3:34:34.700]  rehear the details of that contest
[3:34:34.940 --> 3:34:39.580]  i apologize about getting bummed out there earlier it just
[3:34:39.580 --> 3:34:43.340]  it's so obvious it's so overwhelming it's so
[3:34:43.340 --> 3:34:47.660]  crazy though but the new world order is so bad
[3:34:47.660 --> 3:34:54.620]  they're involved in so many crimes that it is just mind boggling
[3:34:54.620 --> 3:34:57.980]  that a lot of people know they're being lied to now that they're not just
[3:34:57.980 --> 3:35:00.860]  buying into it anymore but they have no idea just how deep the rabbit hole goes
[3:35:00.860 --> 3:35:03.660]  but that's understandable because it's been done
[3:35:03.660 --> 3:35:07.340]  incrementally they've titrated the dose kind of like people that handled
[3:35:07.340 --> 3:35:11.980]  poisonous snakes they start taking very low dosages of the poison and they
[3:35:11.980 --> 3:35:14.140]  build it up and build it up and build it up to the
[3:35:14.140 --> 3:35:17.340]  level of whatever type of poisonous snake whether it's a cobra or rattlesnake
[3:35:17.340 --> 3:35:20.460]  whatever type of toxin it is
[3:35:20.780 --> 3:35:23.980]  until the point where they can be bit by a snake and don't even get that sick
[3:35:23.980 --> 3:35:26.860]  because they've built up a tolerance kind of like somebody who drinks a lot of
[3:35:26.860 --> 3:35:28.940]  whiskey they can drink a bottle of whiskey when that
[3:35:28.940 --> 3:35:32.300]  would kill somebody who didn't drink
[3:35:32.300 --> 3:35:35.500]  like rush limbaugh admitted himself he was taking 100
[3:35:35.500 --> 3:35:39.580]  oxy cottons a day and the media reported the type of oxy cotton
[3:35:39.580 --> 3:35:43.260]  the milligram he was taking would kill a horse that wasn't accustomed to it
[3:35:43.260 --> 3:35:46.700]  it would kill eight horses
[3:35:47.740 --> 3:35:50.060]  yeah
[3:35:50.060 --> 3:35:53.980]  what is that 12 oxy cottons of the type he was taking
[3:35:53.980 --> 3:35:58.140]  would kill a horse whose liver was not accustomed to it
[3:35:58.140 --> 3:36:02.700]  it would kill a man the media was analyzing reporting
[3:36:02.700 --> 3:36:05.420]  five or six of those he was taking if you've never taken that type of
[3:36:05.420 --> 3:36:10.460]  synthetic heroin it would kill you deader than a hammer
[3:36:10.460 --> 3:36:14.300]  and see that's what we're under folks i mean just the wanton crazy evil and all
[3:36:14.300 --> 3:36:16.940]  the national guards gonna be confiscating guns in illinois now
[3:36:16.940 --> 3:36:21.660]  hey we're gonna have checkpoints tsa you know why tsa
[3:36:21.660 --> 3:36:25.820]  body searches you and does behavioral analysis and won't you take liquids on
[3:36:25.820 --> 3:36:28.940]  they're now admitting they want to force you to waive your rights and sign a
[3:36:28.940 --> 3:36:32.860]  trusted traveler where you're on a database where the good guys
[3:36:32.860 --> 3:36:36.380]  are on a database see oh some of you are in a database and can't get off oh
[3:36:36.380 --> 3:36:39.660]  we're just idiots that can't get you off oh but if you all put yourselves on a
[3:36:39.660 --> 3:36:42.540]  database and accept this and let us track everything you're
[3:36:42.540 --> 3:36:45.740]  doing then you can fly easier
[3:36:45.740 --> 3:36:48.460]  see how they just set all that up and nobody seems to understand what they're
[3:36:48.460 --> 3:36:54.140]  doing but me and a few others and then it freaks me out folks it freaks me out
[3:36:54.140 --> 3:36:58.460]  then i know i'm absolutely for real i'm the real deal
[3:36:58.460 --> 3:37:02.220]  i mean look at the fruits i have borne in god's grace
[3:37:02.220 --> 3:37:07.100]  and support despite all my problems and all my warts all my scars
[3:37:07.100 --> 3:37:11.420]  i'm a horrible person but i look at other people i'm wonderful compared to most
[3:37:11.420 --> 3:37:16.460]  i have horrible thoughts i do bad things sometimes and later repent of it
[3:37:16.460 --> 3:37:21.260]  the point is i love goodness i love beauty i love honor i love decency
[3:37:21.260 --> 3:37:25.820]  i love truthfulness i love fidelity i love to be somebody whose word can be
[3:37:25.820 --> 3:37:29.260]  counted on i don't even do it because i want to be moral
[3:37:29.260 --> 3:37:36.540]  i rejoice in moral things i am fulfilled by being a moral person
[3:37:36.540 --> 3:37:39.820]  and i try to not make compromises in life i try to not
[3:37:39.820 --> 3:37:46.460]  bend to things that would advance me i've been fired from jobs fired from radio
[3:37:46.460 --> 3:37:50.140]  i've been death-threaded i've been physically pounded on by four boxers
[3:37:50.140 --> 3:37:54.220]  hired to physically attack me to telling me to shut up and keep my mouth shut
[3:37:54.220 --> 3:37:57.340]  or next time they'd kill me but of course by the end they were dragging
[3:37:57.340 --> 3:38:00.860]  themselves to their minivan but not because i'm a strong man but
[3:38:00.860 --> 3:38:05.420]  because i have got the power
[3:38:05.420 --> 3:38:09.500]  of the creator of the universe in me and every single one of you has it as well
[3:38:09.500 --> 3:38:15.820]  and i'm telling you turn it loose now stop giving into fear commit
[3:38:15.820 --> 3:38:19.980]  fully to fighting evil and putting your body against the machinery of evil and
[3:38:19.980 --> 3:38:23.980]  i don't have orders for you i don't even have ideas for you
[3:38:23.980 --> 3:38:27.580]  i am simply telling you the solution is looking you in the mirror and that means
[3:38:27.580 --> 3:38:30.700]  you're thinking about what you can do and you're taking action and not even
[3:38:30.700 --> 3:38:34.860]  over analyzing but just getting involved and stepping
[3:38:34.860 --> 3:38:40.220]  into a bigger wider world that's all i want for you
[3:38:40.220 --> 3:38:47.660]  i want for you the same thing that i want for myself a good
[3:38:47.660 --> 3:38:53.420]  fulfilled decent honorable healthy life you know i just had an epiphany just a
[3:38:53.420 --> 3:38:56.380]  few seconds ago of why i get so angry sometimes why
[3:38:56.380 --> 3:38:58.940]  every once in a while i get depressed when i'm on air and it's when i have the
[3:38:58.940 --> 3:39:01.100]  greatest energy when i'm the most focused that happens
[3:39:01.100 --> 3:39:04.860]  because i can't even articulate the ideas and the understandings i'm having
[3:39:04.860 --> 3:39:09.820]  and i burn so intensely in my mind in my heart and my bones
[3:39:09.820 --> 3:39:13.740]  that i could just scream till my larynx is torn out just with the energy and i
[3:39:13.740 --> 3:39:17.980]  can't even describe the download of information i have
[3:39:17.980 --> 3:39:23.660]  the the the connections the kaleidoscope of of understanding it's unbelievable
[3:39:23.660 --> 3:39:27.820]  i am blasted by the goodness of god by the wonderful creation
[3:39:27.820 --> 3:39:31.340]  we are living in by all of the majesty of it
[3:39:31.340 --> 3:39:36.620]  meanwhile it's covered in crap new world order droppings are all over it
[3:39:36.620 --> 3:39:41.820]  stench and disgusting filth and evil is all over infesting this beautiful
[3:39:41.820 --> 3:39:46.300]  creation and it tears my soul out
[3:39:46.300 --> 3:39:58.860]  and if hating evil is madness then i am mad
[3:40:00.940 --> 3:40:03.980]  i am literally
[3:40:06.140 --> 3:40:10.220]  i mean how do you not freak out over knowing the government
[3:40:10.220 --> 3:40:13.900]  has brain damaged tens of millions of autistic children and it's a fact
[3:40:13.900 --> 3:40:19.100]  and we have our own documents where they planned it that's some evil stuff there
[3:40:19.820 --> 3:40:24.140]  i know for a fact they're injecting the tropes of cancer viruses it's admitted
[3:40:24.140 --> 3:40:28.060]  with that countless guests on documenting it
[3:40:28.060 --> 3:40:31.660]  and still you idiots go on my message board and on my comment things and make
[3:40:31.660 --> 3:40:35.100]  fun of me i'm not hurt because you're making fun of me
[3:40:35.100 --> 3:40:38.860]  or talking about how you want to kill me and my family and put me in a camp
[3:40:38.860 --> 3:40:43.660]  i get hurt when i go to your handle and i go to your my space and find out you're
[3:40:43.660 --> 3:40:48.220]  really in the military and psychological warfare i feel sorry for you
[3:40:48.220 --> 3:40:52.860]  and the wickedness you're involved in and i feel sorry for you know and there's a
[3:40:52.860 --> 3:40:56.460]  very good chance you're going to die prematurely from your master's hands
[3:40:56.460 --> 3:41:00.220]  i'm sad because i'll never be able to reach out to you i'll never be able to
[3:41:00.220 --> 3:41:02.940]  unlock you i'll never be able to let you see the
[3:41:02.940 --> 3:41:07.420]  light i'll never be able to be your brother
[3:41:07.420 --> 3:41:11.260]  and i feel so sorry for you in this life you live now
[3:41:11.260 --> 3:41:15.340]  and in that life that comes after that that you don't believe in
[3:41:15.340 --> 3:41:19.500]  i see you stunted in in lustful
[3:41:19.500 --> 3:41:25.180]  worship the only way to describe it is sexual congress with evil it's a sexual
[3:41:25.180 --> 3:41:28.940]  uh... demonic it's where the bible describes that's what it is just a
[3:41:28.940 --> 3:41:32.700]  laughing sneering love of evil and wickedness in it
[3:41:32.700 --> 3:41:40.460]  giggling mirthful golem-like abandon to watch you twisted and watch you
[3:41:40.460 --> 3:41:44.620]  brought low and watch you crushed and smashed
[3:41:44.620 --> 3:41:48.300]  sold that evil is beautiful and good like some
[3:41:48.300 --> 3:41:52.300]  sexy chick with devil horns that famous rockabilly
[3:41:52.300 --> 3:41:58.540]  art type when there's nothing sexy or beautiful about evil
[3:41:58.540 --> 3:42:04.620]  evil is ashes and death and destruction and pain and deformity
[3:42:04.620 --> 3:42:08.460]  the beauty that you have been sucked into the thing that you think is
[3:42:08.460 --> 3:42:12.940]  beautiful is diseased and is painful and
[3:42:12.940 --> 3:42:15.580]  wretched
[3:42:17.900 --> 3:42:22.620]  and i see you now ruined many of you at the point
[3:42:22.620 --> 3:42:30.140]  far past the point of no return many of you wantonly given over to darkness
[3:42:30.140 --> 3:42:33.740]  and i watch you drink out of those dark cups
[3:42:33.740 --> 3:42:37.980]  i watch you drink in the dark energies of hell itself
[3:42:37.980 --> 3:42:45.420]  and destruction and i watch you fall forever and it hurts me
[3:42:45.420 --> 3:42:49.820]  and still even worse i watch the diseased masses their minds diseased
[3:42:49.820 --> 3:42:55.980]  with every form of weakness every form of diversion every form of
[3:42:55.980 --> 3:43:01.100]  lack of stewardship lack of discernment
[3:43:01.740 --> 3:43:07.180]  attack me and claim i'm a government agent
[3:43:07.180 --> 3:43:13.260]  how could anyone with any discernment not know that alex jones for all his
[3:43:13.260 --> 3:43:17.900]  problems is committed and is real
[3:43:21.340 --> 3:43:24.620]  and the manufactured lies that are legion against me
[3:43:24.620 --> 3:43:28.780]  it doesn't bother me personally that that's done against my name and my
[3:43:28.780 --> 3:43:33.820]  family name it hurts me because you are
[3:43:33.820 --> 3:43:38.940]  self-righteously ignorant and are walled off from the truth
[3:43:38.940 --> 3:43:43.100]  and are in some cases successfully keeping a lot of people from growing
[3:43:43.100 --> 3:43:45.980]  further and finding out the full scope of the new world order
[3:43:45.980 --> 3:43:52.380]  and ever reversing any of the true damage caused by the new world order
[3:43:52.380 --> 3:43:58.300]  the infighting the backstabbing the it is our modern age it's in businesses it's
[3:43:58.300 --> 3:44:03.660]  in families it's in churches it's everywhere
[3:44:03.660 --> 3:44:08.700]  you always said you will know them by their fruits
[3:44:08.700 --> 3:44:16.380]  and my fruits are legion my fruits are clear
[3:44:16.380 --> 3:44:23.020]  my fruits are there for everyone to see they are good
[3:44:25.020 --> 3:44:28.700]  nine people out of ten some areas eight out of ten
[3:44:28.700 --> 3:44:31.500]  i've talked to people on the street i've been on talk radio interviews i've seen
[3:44:31.500 --> 3:44:34.460]  it on blogs and some people ask the question and have polls on other
[3:44:34.460 --> 3:44:39.740]  websites who woke you up and they will tell you alex jones did
[3:44:39.740 --> 3:44:43.180]  you think i have an ego trip out of that do you think i get on a power trip out
[3:44:43.180 --> 3:44:47.980]  of that no it blast me every day with bowel
[3:44:47.980 --> 3:44:52.860]  shaking responsibility
[3:44:53.740 --> 3:44:59.180]  the weight of having the new world order listen to everything i do on the phone
[3:44:59.180 --> 3:45:04.700]  watch my family threaten my wife to have tens of millions watching what i do
[3:45:04.700 --> 3:45:09.260]  both people who support me and people that hate me
[3:45:13.580 --> 3:45:17.180]  and whereas i once had ego at least to some extent
[3:45:17.180 --> 3:45:21.340]  in my arsenal to drive my psyche and to drive my work
[3:45:21.340 --> 3:45:25.580]  i don't have that ego anymore all i have is the will
[3:45:25.580 --> 3:45:29.980]  that is mistaken for ego to fight the new world order and to live a life to its
[3:45:29.980 --> 3:45:32.940]  fullest and if i'm going to sell my life which it will probably lead to
[3:45:32.940 --> 3:45:35.900]  unfortunately that's where all the roads lead
[3:45:35.900 --> 3:45:41.500]  to sell my life to expose the new world order
[3:45:43.260 --> 3:45:49.660]  not by my hand by theirs i want it to be to its fullest i want to be the most
[3:45:49.660 --> 3:45:55.100]  effective i can in that fight against dehumanization
[3:45:55.100 --> 3:46:05.100]  and an evil
[3:46:06.940 --> 3:46:10.780]  life is a twinkle of an eye
[3:46:11.660 --> 3:46:16.220]  you may be 15 years old right now listening or 25
[3:46:18.140 --> 3:46:23.580]  but death is a doorway we all go through it is the great equalizer
[3:46:23.580 --> 3:46:29.420]  it is something we will all share don't let your life be something of
[3:46:29.420 --> 3:46:33.180]  primping and posing and strutting and your little
[3:46:33.180 --> 3:46:36.460]  subgroups and all of the garbage you're involved in
[3:46:36.460 --> 3:46:41.100]  and chasing after the new world order is almighty dollar
[3:46:42.300 --> 3:46:48.300]  make it about being good and honorable and decent and standing up against evil
[3:46:48.300 --> 3:46:51.820]  the incredible time of history we're all in right now
[3:46:51.820 --> 3:46:55.900]  and so many of you sit idle on the sidelines not being involved in the
[3:46:55.900 --> 3:46:59.660]  greatest contest against good and evil and that has ever been seen on the
[3:46:59.660 --> 3:47:03.180]  surface of this planet
[3:47:03.180 --> 3:47:11.820]  this planet we are on a planet a tiny island in an infinity of matter
[3:47:11.820 --> 3:47:15.740]  an infinity of creation how could any of you not
[3:47:15.740 --> 3:47:20.140]  be just absolutely blown away by creation
[3:47:20.140 --> 3:47:23.100]  by the handiwork
[3:47:23.660 --> 3:47:28.460]  of the creator all around you and to know that you are a creator built in the
[3:47:28.460 --> 3:47:32.700]  image of that supreme being
[3:47:33.500 --> 3:47:37.180]  every new world order leader is a deep occultist obsessed
[3:47:37.180 --> 3:47:40.540]  with the occult and they try to tell you to be an atheist so they can steal
[3:47:40.540 --> 3:47:51.420]  from you your true sight your true connection to the cosmos
[3:47:51.420 --> 3:47:54.300]  and i rebuke
[3:47:56.700 --> 3:48:02.700]  in the name of the living god the living god the creator
[3:48:02.700 --> 3:48:08.220]  the ultimate power of creation of regeneration
[3:48:08.220 --> 3:48:12.300]  i rebuke all those that have stood in my way and stood in others way
[3:48:12.300 --> 3:48:15.580]  trying to unlock people's minds and warn them of the eugenics program being
[3:48:15.580 --> 3:48:19.260]  carried out against everyone on this planet i don't care if you're a jew
[3:48:19.260 --> 3:48:22.780]  or a german or a gypsy
[3:48:23.820 --> 3:48:28.300]  i rebuke all of those that have tried to stand in the way of my work and
[3:48:28.300 --> 3:48:31.820]  others work simply trying to get people to look around them
[3:48:31.820 --> 3:48:35.500]  i don't tell you what to think i just tell you look around you
[3:48:35.500 --> 3:48:39.740]  open your eyes up you can't miss it
[3:48:41.740 --> 3:48:45.420]  and all those enemies from centcom and mainstream media and alternative media
[3:48:45.420 --> 3:48:48.300]  and all the worldly people in this movement that are in this for the
[3:48:48.300 --> 3:48:51.820]  wrong reason you better get your head screwed on and realize this is the
[3:48:51.820 --> 3:48:54.700]  fight of your life a lot of you are prominent in this and you're already

[3:49:01.980 --> 3:49:05.260]  what i'm saying and that the new world order means what they're saying
[3:49:05.260 --> 3:49:11.420]  this stuff's coming down on you you better get your head screwed on straight
[3:49:12.300 --> 3:49:16.140]  and i rebuke all those that have borne false witness against me
[3:49:16.140 --> 3:49:20.780]  that have attacked me and again it isn't that i personally don't like being
[3:49:20.780 --> 3:49:27.020]  attacked i am a sick part of my psyche like it and i rebuke that in myself
[3:49:27.340 --> 3:49:32.700]  oh yes ladies and gentlemen i've tasted evil i've walked on both sides of the
[3:49:32.700 --> 3:49:39.740]  fence ladies and gentlemen
[3:49:45.100 --> 3:49:49.740]  we must recalibrate and refocus and that means exposing the vaccines
[3:49:49.740 --> 3:49:53.420]  that means exposing the sodium fluoride those are key things the cell phones
[3:49:53.420 --> 3:49:57.580]  radiating people's brains the frequency pollution the gmo foods
[3:49:57.580 --> 3:50:00.700]  those are things we can educate people on with the facts

[3:50:04.460 --> 3:50:09.500]  we can educate people on the facts now and that's something they can take
[3:50:09.500 --> 3:50:13.020]  control of in their lives and that will physically help them that will
[3:50:13.020 --> 3:50:16.140]  physically help their mind and the bodies the temple it will help their
[3:50:16.140 --> 3:50:19.660]  soul and those are things we can stop doing now

[3:56:36.940 --> 3:56:40.140]  go into a big rant and that went in the rebroadcast starts in a few minutes
[3:56:40.140 --> 3:56:43.260]  first ron paul he was on the very first minute of the show so
[3:56:43.260 --> 3:56:45.980]  you missed any of that it hadn't been posted on the web yet it's about to
[3:56:45.980 --> 3:56:48.620]  re-air at info wars dot com for listening on the streams you gotta go to
[3:56:48.620 --> 3:56:51.260]  those streams though to find it at info wars dot com
[3:56:51.260 --> 3:56:54.780]  let's go ahead and talk to lindsey in idaho you're on the air
[3:56:54.780 --> 3:56:58.540]  hello yes lindsey yes alex could talk to you again
[3:56:58.540 --> 3:57:01.420]  i just wanted to tell you that your idea today
[3:57:01.420 --> 3:57:06.860]  about your contest was exceptional i think you'll get a tremendous amount of
[3:57:06.860 --> 3:57:09.660]  response and i'm going to be one of them thank you
[3:57:09.660 --> 3:57:13.580]  um the one part and correct me if i'm wrong but i believe
[3:57:13.580 --> 3:57:17.100]  one of the parts of it was to write a declaration
[3:57:17.100 --> 3:57:20.540]  well we're gonna have posted later the contest i just made it up as i went
[3:57:20.540 --> 3:57:23.580]  along okay we're gonna have like two thousand for a new declaration of
[3:57:23.580 --> 3:57:27.820]  independence a thousand dollars uh... but for uh... bill of
[3:57:27.820 --> 3:57:31.500]  particulars listing all their crimes uh... uh... you know the more the better
[3:57:31.500 --> 3:57:34.460]  you know cover all and then we're gonna have a uh... there's a bunch of
[3:57:34.460 --> 3:57:37.420]  contest and then a video exposing how we're being censored
[3:57:37.420 --> 3:57:40.060]  that there's gonna be one for three thousand dollars that we announce on
[3:57:40.060 --> 3:57:42.220]  monday so you got like five days to do that
[3:57:42.220 --> 3:57:45.980]  six days to do that there's another one for five thousand that's going to be on
[3:57:45.980 --> 3:57:50.220]  the uh... nineteen okay well my point is this is something i've always said
[3:57:50.220 --> 3:57:53.500]  sometimes if you want to get people's attention go to their wallets
[3:57:53.500 --> 3:57:57.260]  uh... and i don't care when loser draw that's not the point
[3:57:57.260 --> 3:57:59.420]  right now it's just that
[3:57:59.420 --> 3:58:03.420]  if it motivates people to some degree to more of a degree than what we need
[3:58:03.420 --> 3:58:05.500]  right now it's an excellent idea
[3:58:05.500 --> 3:58:10.140]  i wish it the best uh... now i'll have some time to do this now seeing how i'm
[3:58:10.140 --> 3:58:12.780]  on the uh... ranks of the unemployed
[3:58:12.780 --> 3:58:16.220]  uh... from a large corporation of ten days ago so
[3:58:16.220 --> 3:58:21.180]  uh... that's no matter well we couldn't do this we weren't given a uh...
[3:58:21.180 --> 3:58:25.260]  a donation by a great guy named daryl who didn't want his full name set on air
[3:58:25.260 --> 3:58:28.540]  and so he gave it to me about two three weeks ago and i've just been so busy i
[3:58:28.540 --> 3:58:30.540]  hadn't come up with what contest it should be but
[3:58:30.540 --> 3:58:33.660]  it came to me today and that's probably why i waited in my spirit and
