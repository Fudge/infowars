[08:49.000 --> 08:57.880]  jones and cop killer ploskey now we had played a audio recording of this that that wasn't the
[08:57.880 --> 09:03.160]  highest quality of a better tape was given to gary franche by the folks that did the interview
[09:03.160 --> 09:06.840]  with the southern poverty law center research director
[09:11.240 --> 09:17.080]  and she says that i'm insane and that i influenced ploskey to kill the three cops in pittsburgh now
[09:17.080 --> 09:29.000]  remember we made five newspapers retracted five newspapers we simply posted the comments by
[09:29.000 --> 09:36.280]  ploskey on white supremacist websites about how horrible and evil i am because i don't call for
[09:36.280 --> 09:44.440]  violence and because my show isn't revolving around race and then we found his comments on
[09:44.440 --> 09:50.520]  my website info wars dot com and prison planet dot com attacking me and the southern poverty law
[09:50.520 --> 09:56.600]  center knew that day one why do they know within two hours of the cops being dead on the front
[09:56.600 --> 10:03.800]  lawn of his mommy's house they had already told the pittsburgh post gazette the police and the
[10:03.800 --> 10:10.200]  southern poverty law center using a writer who writes for them who's on that beat of demonizing
[10:10.200 --> 10:18.200]  people that he did it because he supported me and then we found out he hated me always hated me
[10:18.200 --> 10:24.520]  always attacked me and visited thousands of websites fox news cnn why within two hours is
[10:24.520 --> 10:32.120]  the number one thing on their mind alex jones this is creepy this is dangerous this is scary
[10:32.120 --> 10:40.120]  these people don't play games ladies and gentlemen and then some folks go in there to ask them why
[10:40.120 --> 10:44.920]  the southern poverty law centers but we are change which follows mahatma ghandi's idea of
[10:44.920 --> 10:48.600]  either change you want to see in the world be nonviolent and they put them in there saying
[10:48.600 --> 10:55.320]  these are dangerous you know people and we've seen we are change being set up in the media remember
[10:55.320 --> 11:04.200]  a year and a half ago out of a doorway comes a man with a handicap girl in a wheelchair
[11:04.200 --> 11:11.080]  ramming it into jeremy tallis at a we are change event protesting laura bush outside of her book
[11:11.080 --> 11:18.040]  signing calling for funding for police and firemen and emergency workers which they're finally
[11:18.040 --> 11:23.400]  starting to get i mean they weren't even there about 911 truth they were there for the firefighters
[11:23.400 --> 11:28.440]  and police and here he comes i talked to all witnesses they said yeah they won't give us the
[11:28.440 --> 11:35.320]  cameras from the bookstore and i talked to all these we are change witnesses i said no they just
[11:35.320 --> 11:39.640]  came out of the doorways for the ramming the wheelchair into and screaming don't attack my
[11:39.640 --> 11:43.960]  daughter don't hit my daughter and then they arrested him charging with a bunch of serious
[11:43.960 --> 11:49.320]  crimes he was facing more than five years in jail and they told him to plea bargain and he wouldn't
[11:49.320 --> 11:56.840]  do it and once they got the secret service on stand they wouldn't lie like the nypd the nypd
[11:56.840 --> 12:01.400]  got him lied on the stand and the secret service they're not like it's a little more professional
[12:01.400 --> 12:06.920]  they're not gonna ruin their career they're not gonna lie about somebody said no uh he didn't attack
[12:06.920 --> 12:14.440]  him they began ramming him imagine i mean they just run up with a wheelchair and start ramming you
[12:14.440 --> 12:20.840]  these are the type of setups well same thing here you got a guy completely drunk his mother said
[12:20.840 --> 12:27.480]  gets home at 3 a.m at 7 a.m his two pit bulls are urinating all over the floor and defecating
[12:27.480 --> 12:33.320]  she says that's it i told you you couldn't have one dog now you've got two and get out of my house
[12:34.840 --> 12:39.080]  and he said no so he called she called the police and when they pulled up he killed three of them
[12:39.080 --> 12:46.520]  cold bloodedly they need to put him in the electric chair those cops have families
[12:46.520 --> 12:52.200]  they were called to that house by your mommy and they came up to that door and you killed them
[12:52.200 --> 12:58.440]  now the other issue here is why within two hours of him giving himself up was there a
[12:58.440 --> 13:06.040]  headline story that it was all my fault and the proof in the pudding is five newspapers
[13:06.040 --> 13:12.600]  had to retract just like they had to retract the Dallas Morning News had to retract the Denver Post
[13:12.600 --> 13:21.000]  had to retract alex jones screams kill michelle malican the Denver Mint there's a protest going
[13:21.000 --> 13:30.120]  on against the federal reserve during the dnc we hear about it we're walking down to it anarchists
[13:30.120 --> 13:35.080]  come up and are pushing me and shoving me trying to get me in a fight i see the lady that wrote the
[13:35.080 --> 13:41.000]  case for internment about putting Americans in camps in mass for the for their race michelle

[13:48.600 --> 13:52.600]  starts grabbing our camera so we start screaming back at them we get really aggressive it's what we
[13:52.600 --> 13:59.640]  do people that came with her with local bloggers dressed up with masks and hats on covering up
[13:59.640 --> 14:05.800]  their faces and big sunglasses to cover their faces and then big hats start screaming leaning
[14:05.800 --> 14:12.440]  down behind me with their camera in front screaming kill michelle malican definitely
[14:12.440 --> 14:19.400]  staged within hours it's all over international television alex jones says murder woman we forced
[14:19.400 --> 14:27.320]  retractions because we went into our hotel room got the raw video out posted it on youtube by the
[14:27.320 --> 14:33.000]  next day showing it we sent it to the news media and we said here's the guy screaming kill michelle
[14:33.000 --> 14:39.960]  malican here's the video of him leaving with michelle malican first they ran up like they were
[14:39.960 --> 14:44.680]  fans and said oh alex we're big fans hey put their arms around me yeah new world order bring it down
[14:44.680 --> 14:52.040]  to establish that they were with me total frame up total setup so running wheelchairs into 911
[14:52.040 --> 14:59.400]  truth saying that i'm saying kill women saying that i influenced ploskey to kill cops
[15:02.760 --> 15:12.760]  and it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on then they start saying 911 triskin
[15:12.760 --> 15:16.440]  engage in violence 911 triskin engage in violence and there's two ways to look at this either it's
[15:16.440 --> 15:20.440]  making mentally ill people get that idea in their head because the news keeps saying it out of the
[15:20.440 --> 15:25.800]  blue they're gonna attack obama they're gonna attack government buildings guaranteed it's about to
[15:25.800 --> 15:31.240]  happen and i go on air and i say looks like this is about to be staged and then some guy disappears
[15:31.240 --> 15:38.520]  for months he's on all these psychotropic drugs he shows up grazes two cops he gets killed conveniently
[15:38.520 --> 15:43.240]  they're not releasing any other surveillance tape and then it comes out in the associated press
[15:43.240 --> 15:50.120]  and the big tennessee papers that the guns he got came from a police lock up of confiscated
[15:50.120 --> 15:55.480]  firearms and from a year before the shooting at the federal courthouse in nevada came from
[15:55.480 --> 16:02.280]  the same lock up what are the chances of that and it goes on then it turns out this guy was in
[16:02.280 --> 16:08.280]  government negotiations with darpa and homeland security three years ago for patent submissions
[16:08.280 --> 16:14.840]  and was wanting to meet with the pentagon and it goes on and on same story with stack

[24:21.560 --> 24:28.120]  coming up deniz kasinich staunch critic from the left to vote for obama's health care bill
[24:31.000 --> 24:38.600]  but he's doing it reluctantly well i have lost any respect i had for deniz kasinich because he
[24:38.600 --> 24:44.280]  always stuck to his guns even though he was anti-second amendment because he was truly anti-war
[24:44.280 --> 24:51.640]  anti-private federal reserve and had done so much good the fact that he let obama sweet talk him
[24:51.640 --> 24:56.680]  in a private air force one flight with him and promised him lord knows what or threatened him
[24:56.680 --> 25:05.800]  we don't know this is truly disgusting truly disgusting and when his own democratic party
[25:05.800 --> 25:15.960]  was going after his seat a few years ago in his state i supported him and told listeners to donate
[25:15.960 --> 25:22.360]  to his campaign and i feel betrayed and maybe i shouldn't maybe like what deborah medina when
[25:22.360 --> 25:27.160]  she said 9 11 truth was good that was healthy and then said we were despicable maybe i should
[25:27.160 --> 25:32.360]  have just said oh okay i'll i'll i'll go along with a flip-flop i'll give up my convictions
[25:32.360 --> 25:41.400]  i'll i won't even criticize you i never criticized her for not being a 9 11 truth i criticized her
[25:41.400 --> 25:47.240]  for being completely two-faced but i guess as a citizen as a texan i'm not allowed to do that
[25:47.240 --> 25:52.200]  i'm not allowed to speak out or have my views and so oh okay i'll say this good job deniz kasinich
[25:52.200 --> 25:59.160]  good job for completely betraying us i support you everybody sending lots of money i shouldn't
[25:59.160 --> 26:06.360]  be hurt by this it'll probably pass now because of him thanks a lot deniz kasinich thanks for
[26:06.360 --> 26:12.280]  giving him the momentum in fact maybe i shouldn't pull up the old video clips of him from a month
[26:12.280 --> 26:17.640]  ago two months ago five months ago six months ago saying quote it's a bailout to the insurance
[26:17.640 --> 26:25.240]  companies a ripoff it cuts people's services and sells people out and forces 40 million people to
[26:25.240 --> 26:32.040]  get overpriced insurance yeah people that have pre-existing conditions supposedly will get their
[26:32.040 --> 26:38.280]  price lower but then everybody else have to pay more for them instead of having competitive rules
[26:38.280 --> 26:41.960]  where you can shop outside your state and things like that things that would have been good because
[26:41.960 --> 26:46.600]  the insurance system is corrupt they wrote this bill and he pointed that out he point he told the
[26:46.600 --> 26:57.320]  truth so did howard dean a few months ago now he flip-flopped and says it's good
[26:57.320 --> 27:01.960]  and i guess i'm supposed to just go oh that's all right don't talk bad about deniz kasinich
[27:01.960 --> 27:07.320]  it's like protestants getting mad at me whenever i uh got angry 10 years ago at pat robertson
[27:08.440 --> 27:13.480]  saying that abortion and it fantasies what china has to do and they need more of it
[27:13.480 --> 27:19.640]  oh don't talk about pat robertson or when he does global warming ads with al sharpton saying it's
[27:19.640 --> 27:25.320]  real or that obama's good we should all supporting oh okay yeah oh i like you pat robertson i like
[27:25.320 --> 27:27.640]  you al sharpton i like you deniz kasinich
[27:30.760 --> 27:35.880]  see i mean does america want real change or we just want to be conned and lied to by george
[27:35.880 --> 27:45.960]  bush promising to reverse what clinton did instead he expanded it and then obama gets in
[27:45.960 --> 27:52.360]  and completely flip-flops more secret than bush more lobbyist than bush more wars more tyranny
[27:52.360 --> 27:59.160]  more patriot act more torture more secret arrest everything banks ripping us off just
[27:59.160 --> 28:03.560]  continuing the entire operation and i guess i wasn't supposed to make the obama deception
[28:03.560 --> 28:07.800]  or follow the republic exposing this guy i was supposed to just say it's okay
[28:10.200 --> 28:15.720]  no i'm going to be steadfast i'm not going to flip-flop you make me sick deniz kasinich
[28:15.720 --> 28:21.560]  you've betrayed us you have betrayed yourself you have ruined the fact that you were somebody that
[28:21.560 --> 28:26.280]  at least did what they said they would do and that's why i supported you even though you're one of
[28:26.280 --> 28:33.560]  the worst gun grabbers out there because you at least appeared to be somebody of conscious
[28:38.280 --> 28:42.120]  support of what you thought justice was even though you were wrong sometimes
[28:44.280 --> 28:49.800]  because you had courage well this is disgusting what you've done it's disgusting i'm gonna get
[28:49.800 --> 28:56.040]  more into the healthcare barrel after we take some calls here's some of the other news dc home to the

[29:11.400 --> 29:17.160]  torture people and uh it dovetails with the stanford prison experiment how they found that over 90
[29:17.160 --> 29:24.440]  percent of people working at the university graduate students who believe they were killing
[29:24.440 --> 29:29.320]  people under orders just because an authority figure their professor told them to kill someone
[29:30.280 --> 29:35.720]  they would believe they were killing someone and pull the switch that's how they get cops and
[29:35.720 --> 29:41.160]  military to be evil you know hitler ordered the troops to do it they did it our government
[29:41.160 --> 29:44.920]  orders the troops to do it they'll probably do it unless we expose this that's just some of what's

[33:16.200 --> 33:17.640]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen
[33:17.640 --> 33:26.280]  here's some of the other news coming up farma backed australian of the year psychiatrist
[33:26.840 --> 33:33.400]  wants millions in government funding for brave new world of pre-drugging kids this is out of time
[33:33.400 --> 33:40.520]  magazine article drugs before diagnosis that's right they say we need to put basically all
[33:40.520 --> 33:44.920]  the children on drugs that's what's in the new freedom initiative actually that's in my film
[33:44.920 --> 33:50.360]  in game news articles out of england where they're saying if a two-year-old's father or mother ever
[33:50.360 --> 33:55.560]  had mental problems or ever was a criminal we need to go ahead and put two-year-olds on drugs
[33:57.160 --> 34:05.800]  so this is the forced drugging of the population also out of the la times dwp rates power rates
[34:06.440 --> 34:10.600]  may rise between eight and 28 percent to pay for mayor's green initiatives
[34:10.600 --> 34:17.160]  now the same thing is going on here in austin but even worse it's literally a doubling the city
[34:17.160 --> 34:21.400]  council saying they haven't passed it yet they said they were gonna do it in february then in march
[34:21.400 --> 34:26.440]  who knows they haven't really had any hearings on it they're being very secretive but the austin
[34:27.800 --> 34:31.880]  energy department said it's a 2.6 billion dollar tax but it's good for the earth
[34:31.880 --> 34:38.520]  in the first three years 2.6 billion so enjoy your doubling here but only eight to 28 percent
[34:38.520 --> 34:42.120]  of course it's always higher than they say in la the hank would pay for more aggressive
[34:42.120 --> 34:49.800]  conservation programs and a solar plan designed to create 16 000 jobs oh sure sure it will
[34:50.680 --> 34:58.600]  as well as cover the fluctuating price of coal and natural gas california remember in ron 10
[34:58.600 --> 35:03.320]  years ago ripping them off double triple quadruple charging them lying about what the energy really
[35:03.320 --> 35:09.160]  cost state of california deep into that so it's just all about raping you wherever they find trendies
[35:09.160 --> 35:14.600]  they say it's trendy we're gonna charge you more and keep it the money and hire a bunch of inspectors
[35:14.600 --> 35:21.320]  to harass you oh wonderful another story out of the christian science monitor they report this with
[35:21.320 --> 35:27.000]  a straight face as climate change debate wages on scientists turned to hollywood for help to
[35:27.000 --> 35:33.640]  propagandize china trims holdings of treasury securities that's serious news to the dollar
[35:34.760 --> 35:40.440]  that on top of moody's financial rating service saying we may lose our triple a rating on us bonds
[35:46.120 --> 35:51.160]  we talked about this child rape charge rocks tsa logan employee
[35:51.160 --> 35:58.280]  pats down air travelers at naked body scanning stations and it of course doesn't matter they're
[35:58.280 --> 36:04.200]  just going to continue and hire the perverts to run it as they grab your wife's breast and grab
[36:04.200 --> 36:10.520]  your genitals and scan your children that's just the way it is hundreds of american fliers
[36:11.400 --> 36:16.280]  file complaints over naked body scanners this ball joseph watson present planet dot com article

[36:27.320 --> 36:33.720]  from texas in studio in the last hour they've got an event one of 50 going on in every state in the
[36:33.720 --> 36:39.960]  union big presentations exposing the inside job but let's go to your phone calls now bob in jersey
[36:39.960 --> 36:46.120]  thanks for holding her on the air hey thanks a lot alex uh got a comment here i'm in central
[36:46.120 --> 36:51.000]  jersey and that's a first second day of nice weather after about four days of rain and of
[36:51.000 --> 36:56.600]  course the chemtrails are out of control yesterday and today i'm noticing they're doing a lot of
[36:56.600 --> 37:01.000]  high altitude um do you know that there's any difference between the chemtrails that they do
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.240]  like in that crisscross pattern low altitude and when you see a single plane real high with
[37:07.240 --> 37:15.400]  with chemtrails bob i appreciate your call uh look i don't even like to talk about this unless
[37:15.400 --> 37:21.240]  i get into all the evidence because we have new listeners and so many callers want to talk about
[37:21.240 --> 37:29.640]  chemtrails so we're gonna do some more shows on this coming up but condensation trails disappear
[37:29.640 --> 37:36.840]  within a minute ice crystals that's normal but now you have since the mid 90s a secret
[37:36.840 --> 37:42.600]  government program now partially declassified in the last two years government's done press conferences
[37:42.600 --> 37:48.040]  on it but they're geoengineering if the planet was a dead planet they would call it terraforming
[37:48.040 --> 37:58.760]  but because it's already a living planet they call it uh geoengineering and so most of it's
[37:58.760 --> 38:03.240]  classified and so there's lots of different weather modification programs going on the
[38:03.240 --> 38:11.000]  government says it's weather modification but what they're spraying also is toxic to
[38:11.000 --> 38:19.240]  humans and other mammals barium salts aluminum dioxide and other things uh chat in ohio you're
[38:19.240 --> 38:29.320]  on the air um hey i'm calling about the chemtrails too i'm here in columbus and uh we have those up
[38:29.320 --> 38:36.280]  today i'm just wondering if uh every time i see see those if uh just call 911 and just uh
[38:36.920 --> 38:41.720]  you know complain that there's plenty in the air spraying us with chemicals if uh just get the word
[38:41.720 --> 38:48.920]  out well so many people have called the faa and called their police and then folks ferreted out
[38:48.920 --> 38:54.600]  that in plain view universities admitted but they use the scientific terms uh of
[38:54.600 --> 39:02.600]  you know aerial aerosol weather modification programs that now the white house uh science
[39:02.600 --> 39:07.480]  are again has given multiple press conferences admits that they've been quote testing it but
[39:07.480 --> 39:13.880]  now they want to go full scale and bill gates has got patents on it and says he's going to
[39:13.880 --> 39:18.920]  save us with big government contracts billions to his companies to protect us from
[39:18.920 --> 39:25.400]  tornadoes and protect us from hurricanes and protect us from all these things but
[39:26.680 --> 39:32.040]  meanwhile it's a problem reaction solution situation because the evidence clearly shows
[39:32.040 --> 39:37.240]  it's the government manipulating a lot of this and also they can launch bizarre weather disasters
[39:37.880 --> 39:43.320]  and then hype it up and say see we need to now sell you weather control to protect you from this
[39:43.320 --> 39:48.920]  jet but you know the local police they're not going to know what's going on it would be the faa you'd
[39:48.920 --> 39:56.280]  call okay well yeah i was just suggesting that just maybe to uh you know awaken um some of police
[39:56.280 --> 40:02.920]  officers and stuff just to get it out there they just may and you'd probably beat it in court they
[40:02.920 --> 40:10.440]  might charge you with a fake 911 call you might call 311 just for information uh and and and
[40:10.440 --> 40:15.480]  educate them if you want and and and see if they'll call the faa but uh i you probably don't want to
[40:15.480 --> 40:20.120]  call 911 yet i appreciate it because there might be somebody having their house broken into or a
[40:20.120 --> 40:24.920]  car wreck or something and you know it it might stop response time by two or three minutes if
[40:24.920 --> 40:30.840]  they're busy with you on the phone then somebody bleeds to death uh but uh go to city council talk
[40:30.840 --> 40:35.720]  about it you know call talk radio about it like you're doing here but call shows where they may
[40:35.720 --> 40:41.080]  not know and and and also get together all the articles we've written in info wars dot net prison
[40:41.080 --> 40:47.880]  planet dot com about chemtrails just just google chemtrails info wars dot com you'll see videos
[40:47.880 --> 40:53.480]  photos literally hundreds of articles over the last 12 13 years we've had info wars last eight
[40:53.480 --> 40:58.600]  years with prison planet and you can see government documents links to the cfr admitting it links to
[40:58.600 --> 41:04.120]  holdren admitting it i mean this is i suggest people not just say oh look up in the sky people
[41:04.120 --> 41:09.880]  go oh you're a nut you know take your neighbors the material i haven't decided yet with the next
[41:09.880 --> 41:14.600]  fall of the republic whether we're going to have the chemtrail research we've done in that or is
[41:14.600 --> 41:18.600]  it will that be a whole another film but i mean i've done interviews all over the country sent
[41:18.600 --> 41:23.240]  my team everywhere we got government documents we've got the government admitting it internal
[41:23.240 --> 41:29.320]  documents video audio we are changes went into a big geo engineering conference with a club of
[41:29.320 --> 41:34.760]  roam and interviewed people and i've been so busy i haven't even watched the video they sent us
[41:34.760 --> 41:40.920]  last week i mean it's just we're drowning in evidence they're doing it but because people
[41:40.920 --> 41:46.840]  don't go out and get the actual source documents it's still a conspiracy theory it is not debatable
[41:48.040 --> 41:52.920]  it's like fema camps it's on record they're there they have legislation it's in the fema documents
[41:52.920 --> 41:59.480]  there's the civilian inmate labor camp program but then glenn bet goes out and debunks it by picking
[41:59.480 --> 42:05.800]  conspiracy sites that speculate or go to an amtrak station or go to a military training facility and
[42:05.800 --> 42:13.400]  say oh look it's a camp meanwhile there's camps admitted everywhere but no one it seems wants
[42:13.400 --> 42:18.520]  to focus in on the real camps that's why i've made police state for the rise of fema eight years
[42:18.520 --> 42:26.680]  since i've made a new police state film we almost called it police state 2010 but it's it's the first
[42:26.680 --> 42:30.600]  one was police state 2010 years later but this is we're calling it police state for the rise of fema
[42:31.880 --> 42:37.400]  it's a two hour plus film about half of it's about fema continuity government fema camps the rest
[42:37.400 --> 42:44.120]  is about police state gun grabbing troops on the streets it's powerful folks a year ago i started
[42:44.120 --> 42:47.880]  producing it when glenn bet was out doing his fake debunking and i was just going to put it out
[42:47.880 --> 42:55.640]  quickly but i just ended up spending a year on it because i mean you know a information video that
[42:55.640 --> 42:59.800]  takes two three months to make is great but we ended up putting a lot more into it and it's
[42:59.800 --> 43:05.880]  turned into a really powerful film i mean i wanted to just churn it out but it's kind of like the
[43:05.880 --> 43:12.360]  old orson well's ads for for wine where he'd say we will sell no wine until it's time
[43:12.360 --> 43:18.920]  him so this was just kind of kind of be just a kind of ten dollar bottle of a keonte off the
[43:18.920 --> 43:25.800]  shelf that it's okay table wine now it's a it's a it's a good bouquet here of information
[43:25.800 --> 43:30.200]  same thing with bermas's film i mean i i'm so close to this and it's almost hard for me to
[43:30.200 --> 43:35.160]  even hype how good these films are i'm like oh yeah i got some new films are they're really good
[43:35.160 --> 43:40.120]  you need to have them break some new ground covers a lot of issues they're both pre-selling

[45:01.160 --> 45:05.400]  that i ran into the face of the new world order here in mid michigan and he sits at the head of
[45:05.400 --> 45:11.080]  my city water department um one other thing i wanted to tell you i did get some information out of him
[45:11.080 --> 45:17.160]  on the actual companies that they buy the admitted hydrofluorosacillic acid from
[45:17.160 --> 45:20.600]  and the one you can pull up the msds is for the sheet rate on their
[45:20.600 --> 45:27.320]  or for the stuff right on their website um so so so so they buy their toxic brew
[45:27.880 --> 45:32.520]  from a nuclear weapons uranium enrichment facility or do they buy it from an aluminum
[45:32.520 --> 45:39.640]  facility or do they buy it from a uh mining operation where they mine the limestone to
[45:39.640 --> 45:46.920]  produce uh the crop fertilizer well he ironically called it a co-product not a byproduct um
[45:47.720 --> 45:51.720]  if the company they buy it from is a fluoride specialist i didn't know if i should say the
[45:51.720 --> 45:58.840]  name or not now go ahead oh it's lti uh limited so it's that's their website is lti but you can
[45:58.840 --> 46:02.840]  look them up and see where they're getting their fluoride yeah and i looked yesterday and i couldn't
[46:02.840 --> 46:07.400]  find anything other because i pulled up the msds and got caught up and reading those and
[46:08.360 --> 46:14.120]  wanted to vomit all over um this guy that i talked to man he told me that if the cdc said
[46:14.120 --> 46:22.440]  mercury is safe he'd drink it you're joking no i'm not joking at all well i'm not the uh the the
[46:22.440 --> 46:27.960]  government now says mercury is good for you and helps your brain that's official uh they now say
[46:27.960 --> 46:32.600]  melamine is good for children that's associated press you know now we go oh this mercury's hurting
[46:32.600 --> 46:37.080]  us oh it's good for you oh this melamine liquid plastics hurting us no it's good for you uh oh
[46:37.080 --> 46:40.920]  this corn syrup all the studies show it's it's burning out the pancreas no it's good for you
[46:41.720 --> 46:47.960]  oh hey uh showing prozacs killing people making you go psychotic in 1981 during the trials it
[46:47.960 --> 46:54.840]  showed a massive 15 time fold increase in suicide and it took us what they put it on
[46:54.840 --> 47:04.840]  there five years ago so 81 to 2005 uh we're talking 20 24 years and we finally forced them in 2005
[47:04.840 --> 47:11.400]  worldwide all serotonin reuptake inhibitors say causes psychotic breaks mass murder delusions
[47:12.280 --> 47:19.000]  mania depression uh and and that's why every mass shooter we've seen has been on it the guy at the
[47:19.000 --> 47:29.080]  courthouse in nevada on it uh the guy at the base on a bunch of stuff and it's just it it never ends
[47:29.080 --> 47:35.960]  of the guy at ford hood and nutcase psychiatrist uh but so so so he said if they say mercury's good
[47:35.960 --> 47:42.680]  i'll drink it no he said that exactly in in fact his only defense against all of i mean i i got a
[47:42.680 --> 47:47.240]  bunch of information on it and got ready and called him and everything i said you know talking about
[47:47.240 --> 47:54.280]  how but you can send him the official letter from 2000 and again 2005 from the head union with over
[47:54.280 --> 48:00.280]  90 percent of epa toxicologist and scientist sending letters saying this is deadly poison take it out
[48:00.280 --> 48:04.840]  i mean i mean we got c span videos of him testifying before congress i mean what i mean he says that
[48:04.840 --> 48:10.120]  doesn't exist well yeah he said all the information that he got is backed up by the cdc all he could
[48:10.120 --> 48:15.880]  do is fall back on the cdc that's why i brought up the swine flu to him and how it was a known scam
[48:15.880 --> 48:21.000]  and admitted and he told me the reason i didn't get the get the flu this year not because the vitamin
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.640]  d that i was taking it was because he got the vaccine and that didn't spread it to me that was
[48:25.640 --> 48:31.320]  why i didn't send him the national post and the fda dot gov's own articles that we covered sunday
[48:31.320 --> 48:36.200]  and monday and it's all screenshotted on the videos that are posted me by wants to see it you can see
[48:36.200 --> 48:41.000]  the headlines and pull it up for yourself uh saying that they're recalling it now and then it protected
[48:41.000 --> 48:47.080]  no one and was a complete fraud he didn't care about that no you know but the thing that made me
[48:47.080 --> 48:52.120]  think he was new world order is that he tried to compare the fluoride in the water to vitamin d
[48:52.120 --> 48:57.080]  and milk and then he called vitamin d a drug and that was kind of suspicious to me why would he
[48:57.080 --> 49:03.000]  instantly call that's right because under codex alimentarius in canada and other nations toronto
[49:03.000 --> 49:08.840]  star they're listing it now as a drug and ordering the drug stores and pharmacies and health food
[49:08.840 --> 49:14.040]  stores not to sell it's not even a law they said we may find you or arrest you and just
[49:14.040 --> 49:18.520]  send a letter saying don't sell this oh oh yeah they've been all over the news demonizing vitamin
[49:18.520 --> 49:25.000]  d listen listen listen it's worse than that they set reality that that's like carl rove told the
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.080]  new york times we control reality and we'll change reality next week and you'll believe it we're
[49:29.080 --> 49:36.440]  history's actors now uh what what two conspiracies we he lists three or four nine eleven truth and
[49:36.440 --> 49:42.680]  a few others but the two main ones he said cast sunstein white house regulations are he sets all
[49:42.680 --> 49:48.520]  this up now outside of law he just orders the bureaucracies to do it he said we will ban we
[49:48.520 --> 49:56.520]  will make it illegal or at least tax saying that sunshine is good for you when i'm not exaggerating
[49:56.520 --> 50:03.880]  thousands of studies over the last 50 years they know it reduces cancer to get moderate sun grandma
[50:03.880 --> 50:10.680]  new go outdoors get some sun uh grandma it's turned out in major studies great grandma was right
[50:10.680 --> 50:14.920]  why do you get sick when you're out in the cold because your body switches off its autoimmune
[50:14.920 --> 50:20.040]  system to warm the body and so germs can get through easier that's what the studies now
[50:20.040 --> 50:24.680]  conclusively prove it isn't the cold that makes you sick you know they say oh shut that window honey
[50:24.680 --> 50:31.000]  you'll catch your death it's that it's that when it's cold especially the mucus membranes where
[50:31.000 --> 50:36.840]  you're breathing it shuts down just to heat the body and then the germs can get through the microbes
[50:36.840 --> 50:42.920]  the viruses and bacteria uh but uh oh yeah well no that guy's just brainwash he looks he likes his
[50:42.920 --> 50:47.960]  job he likes his paycheck he likes the football game he likes the miller light it's miller time
[50:47.960 --> 50:53.560]  and he's gonna live in denial once you're committed to denial you just burrow deeper deeper into it
[50:53.560 --> 50:58.360]  and then you're committed to the lie so you rationalize everything it's called prime stop

[54:39.560 --> 54:46.360]  listen long time long time shortwave listener um i'm just wondering man this electronic
[54:46.360 --> 54:52.520]  beeping in the background at times is everywhere in the southwest is like incredible i mean it's
[54:52.520 --> 54:58.680]  almost like some kind of mind control experiment see how much i can handle well let me stop you
[54:58.680 --> 55:07.960]  let me stop you abc news reported the kokomo hum um and it's been associated with underground
[55:07.960 --> 55:14.440]  tunneling machines that were declassified in the 50s nuclear powered locomotives that can
[55:14.440 --> 55:21.480]  and i want to say tunnel as much as uh well i don't want to go from memory but it's a massive
[55:21.480 --> 55:28.280]  amount per hour and that can cause a harmonic hum just like if you go up to a metal shed and
[55:28.280 --> 55:32.920]  start banging it at the right frequency with your hand you can make the whole shed shake well
[55:32.920 --> 55:37.400]  when they've got a giant tunnelers underground with all these huge bases and underground railways
[55:37.400 --> 55:43.320]  that they admit they've got but how big they are are classified uh that can cause it but i saw
[55:43.320 --> 55:49.000]  baltimore sun article and a couple wired magazine articles in the last 10 years folks can pull it
[55:49.000 --> 55:57.000]  up darpa admitted they're testing towers that look like cell phone towers that send out a frequency
[55:57.000 --> 56:03.800]  that can calm you can make you get nauseated uh in fact that's in my road to tyranny film
[56:03.800 --> 56:11.240]  out of a law enforcement catalog for only a few hundred bucks they sell the sonic nauseator
[56:11.240 --> 56:18.920]  pack guys google that see if it's still sold the sonic nauseator and the super sonic nauseator
[56:18.920 --> 56:26.120]  and the law enforcement catalogs sell these subsonic hum machines and it says this is actually
[56:26.120 --> 56:29.640]  in the road to tyranny from the catalog you want to go to an event and make the speakers
[56:29.640 --> 56:35.240]  nauseated to disrupt the american people by the supersonic nauseator uh you want to make people
[56:35.240 --> 56:40.520]  sick in your prison and so they just turn these on in the prison and you know at night to harass
[56:40.520 --> 56:46.040]  everybody and they and they buy them their little goodies and so that's just for 500 bucks 200
[56:46.040 --> 56:50.760]  bucks for the smaller one going for memory uh that's something they just torture people with
[56:50.760 --> 56:54.840]  but yes they are testing this you know it's like i told people 10 years ago oh they're gonna have
[56:54.840 --> 56:58.840]  microwave cannons and sound cannons i was reading the government documents now they're actually out
[56:58.840 --> 57:03.240]  at the tea parties they're at the g20 they're firing they're blasting they're attacking
[57:03.240 --> 57:08.120]  they they use microwave weapons in iraq and feluja where they can just blast the whole
[57:08.120 --> 57:11.960]  neighborhood make everybody start getting sick and vomiting and they keep on long enough it'll
[57:11.960 --> 57:16.520]  kill you and it's just all part of the fun uh but it must be tough for schizophrenics though
[57:16.520 --> 57:21.080]  because they're already imagining this stuff now it's really happening and so there's some
[57:21.080 --> 57:25.400]  schizophrenia people worried about it and then there's other people that are legitimately
[57:25.400 --> 57:31.400]  being attacked but go ahead alex i have one other thing too um one once we get off of this

[59:04.840 --> 59:09.800]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[59:09.800 --> 59:15.720]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can

[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:55.400]  shortwave frequencies in the summer in the winter and voice of america follows us uh this tone
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:01.720]  follows us and we know that uh mount weather and a few other big pentagon
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:10.680]  c o g bases are the ones that run these international metric time code systems is the way it's
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:18.120]  described and so they just tune over to us and and blast blast the tone uh and bongs and everything
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:26.760]  else uh and beeps and they'll also run uh morse code over us north korea runs over us the communist
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.640]  chinese run over us and wmcr has these frequencies worldwide they're one of the biggest shortwave
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:36.760]  outfits out there it's just all part of the harassment uh but anything else david yeah i'm
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:41.640]  i want to get to one other thing real quick but on the shortwave i mean you're absolutely right
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.920]  because every time you move it's like they follow you you know it's just i hope you just realize
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:53.400]  for all of us that are off the grid how important it is to keep your shortwave going i mean i know
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:58.280]  so many people are on the net now and that's probably most of the new listeners and everything
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:03.320]  you've got are all you know over the net in one way or another but there is a lot of us out there
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.800]  alex so i just hope that somehow you keep the shortwave going we don't we don't pay for our am
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.360]  and fm stations i've got a few that have asked for help here and there we've helped out a little
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.760]  bit who've been long time uh supporters of the show but but 90 plus percent of our affiliates
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.840]  we got three more this week in fact and i lost the list of the new affiliates we guys print that
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:28.120]  again i want to plug those coming up three new affiliates this week wow uh but uh the shortwave
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:33.640]  does not pay for itself we do pay for that it's $10,000 a month and which is a good price from
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:40.280]  wwcr they carry eight hours a day but uh that's why i've got to constantly sell books videos
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:45.400]  t-shirts materials to pay for internet man with shortwave and because it's all about getting
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:49.880]  the message out and plus when you get books and videos it wakes you up more you give it to others
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:54.760]  it wakes them up so it's a symbiotic relationship but that's why i'm always every hour sponsors
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:59.720]  videos books because we got a big nut to crack thank god we've expanded the audience enough
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:05.320]  to be able to pay for everything but we are on a mission uh here so god bless you i appreciate
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:12.520]  your call david i know how important the wwcr eight hours a day is and i called wwcr about six
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:16.680]  months ago and said look i'm gonna have to dump nighttime i i was paying even more i said i can't
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.760]  pay for this and they said look we'll just give you a huge discount um and they've told me on
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:26.200]  their number one most popular show in wwcr i mean that's where marlon maddox pretty much got his
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:35.000]  start uh and uh god bless him a powerful radio show but uh it's we could do so much more if we
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  weren't paying $120,000 a year for that i mean that's think about the amount of money that's like
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.120]  i live in a pretty nice house drive a decent car but that those payments are nothing they
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:51.640]  i spend a tiny amount of the money that comes in on myself uh you know we need to be comfortable
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.080]  we need to be able to take care of my family we've got some money saved because we get sued or
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.240]  attacked or the whole economy shuts down so we can operate for six months we got six months of
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:03.880]  operating capital uh but we tried to be good stewards here but i just look at the amount of
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:11.000]  money we pump $400,000 in it and uh bandwidth and i and i just upped that we're building a giant

[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:39.400]  controlled the awakening that's happening but a caller called in in the last segment
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:43.480]  and was talking about how he listens to me on global shortwave we've been on shortwave
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:49.240]  13 years and we're on eight hours a day the live four hour show and then reared what nine
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:57.000]  central p.m. to one a.m. on w w c r the best shortwave outfit here in the u.s.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:03.800]  hundred thousand watts really great folks and how we're jammed by voice of america they follow us
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:11.000]  when we change frequencies by the communist chinese by north korean radio and by government tones
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:17.800]  and it's the government that broadcasts these these tones that's what the shortwave experts
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:23.080]  have told us because the government admits they put out these time tones and morse code and it's
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:27.960]  and and the government always requests to be right next to us and they bleed over and i've had
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:32.280]  discussions with w w c r over the years they go yeah we agree to change frequencies then they move
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:37.640]  wherever you're at time changes they move they have people that fire up on shortwave and attack
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:44.440]  me and lie about me and play music over us and we get hack attacks of all different types you name
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:52.280]  it but another example of tyranny is zoning almost a year ago i signed the lease for the
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:58.120]  thousands of square feet next to this office and it's a warehouse in an area of austin where you
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:04.200]  can basically do whatever you want it's a standard building standard thing we're building they they
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:09.240]  keep coming in and nickel and diming saying change this change that you got to put in another firewall
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.720]  here where they don't make the other people in the same complex the exact same buildings do it
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:19.640]  and they do what they want they do what they want in austin they harass everybody but they're
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:24.520]  really harassing us here's the austin american statesman on this appeals court sides with south
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:31.960]  congress cafe in city lawsuit the cafe wanted to build a little deck on their own property
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.360]  and the city of austin made them make two hundred thousand dollars of improvements
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.840]  then they said you know what we've changed our mind you can't even build that now they've
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:44.760]  spent hundreds of thousands in the appeals process the city of austin spending hundreds of
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:51.640]  thousands and now it's going to go to the supreme court over a wooden deck at a restaurant
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:58.840]  i guess they didn't make the right payoffs in the city suit against the city of austin over banned
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:03.400]  deck likely headed to a jury trial attorney say and if that doesn't work it will go on the supreme
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:08.360]  court looks like a jury will decide whether south austin cafe has to tear down its deck which they
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:13.560]  got approved and they said no you can't on thursday a state appeals court sided with the cafe's owners
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:17.960]  ruling that a lower court did not give south congress cafe a proper hearing before siding
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:22.360]  with the city which contends the deck was built illegally and should be torn down and they go
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:32.680]  through the whole story of how what trudies did how they had approval in writing how they made
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:39.080]  hundreds of thousands of dollars of changes to do this and and this is feudalism in ancient europe
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:44.520]  you couldn't plant onions unless you had an authorization serfs couldn't own a knife with
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:49.160]  a pointed end they would take serfs who were allowed to say have a sheepdog to guard the local
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:55.000]  noble sheep but they would cut off several of the of the paw digits so that so that the dog couldn't
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:04.440]  hunt the king's game deer stags um they had prima noctis uh where they were allowed to have sex
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:09.720]  with your wife on your wedding night as a system of control i mean it and i tell you who's an
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:15.160]  expert on this is alan watt let's get into zoning first alan and how it's all written by the united
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.800]  nations you know this but break it down for folks it's just i know you go through a lot of harassment
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:25.240]  and hacking and attacks as well which is the segment or the certification that you're the real deal
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:32.920]  i had three websites went down last week uh and um one of them was a transfer from one
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:39.640]  uh file to another on a separate site and they lost the last 30 shows so it takes
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.320]  a lot of harassment because they know we see them on the satellite upload they know it takes me
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:48.360]  time to upload all the stuff again uh it's a constant harassment you get with this kind of thing
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:54.360]  and your audio is breaking up a bit can you turn your turn your audio up yes um how's that
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:01.560]  yeah that's better yeah the satellite too i mean satellite uh i'm on explore net which the
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:07.800]  division of subdivision of via that which is also subdivision of use cooperation in the military
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:13.800]  industrial boys and they uh i have admitted to me that they've got me on a lock for uploads
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:19.400]  so they claim i'm using too much a bandwidth and so on they simply kick me in every 10 minutes
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:24.360]  i've only waited 10 minutes before i can reset it and upload again it's definitely constant
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:28.840]  harassment and i talk to you about this even though you're paying for the bandwidth they just won't
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:33.400]  give it to you they won't give it to me and i'm i'm paying for high speed supposedly and often
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:42.280]  at customs would twice be the dial up yeah amazing but zoning itself being used globally
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:47.080]  we have the same zoning laws in the us you have in canada the same in europe the same in australia
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:52.360]  under the green legislation they're really accelerating that yes uh they've had it actually
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:59.640]  for years we don't realize that for the last 15 to 20 years every zoning law to do with plumbing
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:05.480]  that's typically electrical building codes of all kinds have all come via the united nations
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:12.760]  department we were to the u n as a copy of your own federal government only is designed to handle
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:18.120]  the whole world federal government and they have a department to do with building codes and all that
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.920]  and i've got this from town planners um one in simpson at the other ones in the u.s state
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:27.400]  through the head planners for the city they thought they've told me and the victims have been given a
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:33.160]  lot of information on this all of this coming from the united nations and they're really pushing now
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:39.480]  that accept their visions within each country to go around and inspect premises on top of your
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:45.000]  local building inspectors code so they're enforcing these world standard codes everywhere yeah
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:54.280]  and it gets worse and worse and worse and worse and there's this entire criminal class did you see
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:01.800]  the big canadian study that the bbc covered uh where they did test of people that are self-professed
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:07.240]  environmentalist and they're six times more likely to steal they hate their fellow man
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.880]  their their greedy parasitic control freaks on average did you see that study that came out two
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:18.600]  days ago a and b what's your take on it yes because well you'd understand the mentality of uh
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:25.720]  the people who join where called fringe groups as a science itself because communism understands
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:30.360]  that all the big movements understand that the people they go for who they target generally on
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:35.240]  their fringe they put a personal chip in their shoulder and they submerge themselves actually
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:40.840]  hate themselves in a sense to go submerge themselves lose their individual identity within
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:46.280]  the big group and then they become devoted fanatical followers but you're right they're not stable to
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:52.440]  begin with uh the ones who join the big groups and there's a lot of university groups um out there
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:57.880]  on this particular subject the science which is used but they're used en masse for the big boys
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:05.320]  to get their agendas through they're quite right yeah well ellen so much is going on in the world
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.880]  iceland has said no to the banks greece is getting ready to say no for their takeover they want to
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:15.960]  launch new wars with iran uh and the brainwashing is really intensifying they're now proposing
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:21.560]  drugging children before they get depressed i mean it seems like they're really pulling out all the
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:29.080]  stops this is the whole brave new world scenario it's been planned well over 100 years ago uh the
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:35.720]  science of the mind is the most important science of all and the big boys have uh the real histories
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:41.560]  and archives of controlling whole continents and empires of people they understand how we pick
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:47.880]  and uh they're going the whole way now to the age of austerity which means basically um teaching us
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:53.560]  to be poor and happy at the same time and it can be difficult to discuss all the ways they can actually
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.520]  keep us happy and poor because i said the last night on my show we can be dressed in the rides
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:03.640]  as long as you've got that little ipod there or your or your little cell phone um and give you
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:08.600]  keep entertainment that keep us going for years this way as we're take we're taken down this has
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:15.240]  all been discussed at the pink tanks at the top and of course then your iphone or your cell phone
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:20.680]  is your little personal computer that tracks your location everything you're going uh you know all
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:28.200]  the places you're traveling to the iphone actually is also a your main id and so that's becoming
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:33.880]  night google has said itself within two or three years so phase out the computer as we know it
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:39.080]  and you might have monitors because plug your iphone in and that'll be your personal computer
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:43.640]  that goes everywhere with you you'll do all your banking through it they can monitor everything
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:50.520]  that you personally are transacting and all your emails and etc uh this this is the agenda
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:55.720]  then of course the big one is the cloud you're going to do away with uh computers with personal
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:00.280]  hard drives you won't need to go tell you that we'll keep all your data out there in the cloud
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:05.880]  for you and uh and you can access it anytime you want if you're a good boy or girl because it's
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:11.400]  going to be used with um for punishment as well as reward that's right the new internet internet
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:16.600]  to you will have a subdomain with another big company cloud computing is where it's all going
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:22.040]  they're building the infrastructure so that you can't use servers or even cds you'll have to be
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:27.800]  in the cloud and and and so computers won't even be designed you won't be able to buy computers
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.880]  basically where you save your own data because they won't be able to interface with the new
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:37.640]  cyber security global rules you'll have to be in the cloud then they have all your data all your
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:42.200]  photos all your videos all your banking data and if you're not a good globalist they're just going
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:48.040]  to turn it off and they're saying that yes it's going to be used for punishment and reward uh
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:52.920]  that everything in society if you don't realize this that even money itself is used as punishment
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:59.000]  and reward it's very pavlovian and the same with your entertainment but once you make it mandatory
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:06.200]  that all transactions must go through electronic transactions through your your iphone um and now
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.120]  it's coming there's so many articles out even today about that coming up from the mainstream bank
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:16.120]  then they can literally as veteran russells said 60 or 70 years ago eventually they'll use
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:21.240]  a credit system and if you are anti-social that could take work now across the world especially
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:26.920]  in britain you're anti-social if you're anti-social you know part of the communitarianism project
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:31.960]  that then you'll cut you off it's a punishment until you you totalize alan stay there when
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:39.080]  we come back i want to get into anti um social behavior as they call it where if you're rude
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:45.080]  or if you don't accept what the government's saying or you don't volunteer you're a criminal
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:50.920]  and they have these databases even on children all over the world now where oh your data stream

[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:19.960]  are coming up the toll free number to join us 1-800-259-9231 alan's one of those few guests we
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:24.360]  can get on to talk about basically any subject i have read hundreds and hundreds of books written
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:29.400]  by the globalist i have read thousands of their own documents tens of thousands of news articles
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:35.000]  they're white papers and so that's why when i get alan watt on i know he knows what he's talking about
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.320]  because he knows the exact same info i know but from sometimes a different perspective
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.240]  in his own way of delivering it and so i've been asking some of the questions here
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:47.320]  i want him to get into whatever he thinks is most important and news that's happened lately and
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:51.480]  things that are developing and where he sees the world what he thinks of these shootings and
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:57.400]  at the pentagon and the kamikaze attack and the calls for censoring the web but but you were
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:03.320]  getting into antisocial behavior they they now call taking a photo of your child in the us
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:09.320]  or in england at a park antisocial pedophilia they're arresting people who take photos of
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:14.200]  their daughters in bikinis in their own pool that's now illegal though if there's not a law
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:20.600]  they're now demonizing in i mean it's political correctness into every level where they're just
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:26.920]  coming after the citizenry so alan watt continue along those lines yeah this is the the fabian
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:33.480]  fabian technique that was also used in the soviet system where they believe that through scientific
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:39.160]  alteration of the mind itself through different techniques they can create the type of person
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:46.200]  they want and as a form of political correctness now they tried it out extensively in china china
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:53.240]  was the prototype model uh after the soviet union for this more advanced form of collectivism where
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:58.280]  everyone thinks the same says the same things behaves the same way even sometimes dresses
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:04.360]  the same way depends on the era but um they had two men working at the united nations who dreamed
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:11.720]  up the idea uh to test out on china using social approval and social disapproval and what they did
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:18.520]  they studied the the cultural history of the chinese and they found out that traditionally
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:24.840]  what certain objectives in mind uh deep population was one and traditionally china had often very
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:31.720]  often as a matter of his culture had killed off newborn children especially females if they were
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:36.360]  they didn't need so many type of thing and they thought how can we bring this into the new system
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:41.640]  where we want to drastically reduce their population uh they actually encouraged that as you know
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:47.400]  and they brought in the one child per family policy uh initially and the you the guys at the
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:52.680]  un said this in one of their own statements recently they said initially uh the militia
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:58.760]  had to come to drag women to the borschen clinics if they had a second pregnancy now they've trained
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:04.760]  the public that the neighbors themselves will drag the woman in to the clinic uh because
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:10.120]  they consider it as anti-social to have a second child you're robbing the food from someone else's
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:15.240]  mouth type of thing you're not collective enough and get really angry they'll do it you can
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:20.120]  that's what the phony environmental movement is all about is teaching us the pie doesn't grow
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:26.200]  rising tides don't raise all ships anyone doing well is your enemy and so you need to get into
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:30.600]  the collectivist model and once we have collectivist health care then we've got a tax what you eat
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:36.520]  and do because we're all paying for it and this is the nasty trick that the that the
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:42.920]  collectivist paradigm uses yeah as this is called social approval and disapproval and uh
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:50.280]  in china the two guys serve such as a success these guys dreamed up these uh two uh neuro
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:55.080]  scientists um they dreamed up this idea this is such a success that they then turned they were the
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:28:00.520]  guys who brought in the united nations war on smoking and they trained the children at school
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:06.200]  to have pavlovian responses if they saw anyone light up a cigarette 20 feet away and i've witnessed
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:11.560]  that myself they're going to a sort of proxism a spasm of coughing and waving their hands it's
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:17.000]  20 feet away that's pavlovian oh yeah let alan i have trouble with smoking i started i stopped it

[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:26.840]  eating i don't smoke anywhere near them a few weeks ago and i fell off the wagon i was smoking
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:34.200]  cigarettes and i went out on the back deck and fired up a cigarette and a woman in the parking
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:40.200]  lot no exaggeration had to be 40 feet away i just lit the cigarette as she starts waving her hands
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:46.040]  coughing and and and freaking out and runs over and says your cigarette is hurting me i mean this
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:52.280]  is a control freak and i said hey lady you know uh don't worry your police state's taking over

[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:06.920]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:12.440]  there's hundreds of different ways that the establishment
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:19.880]  conditions us to be cattle tails to hate our fellow man the torture porn in the movies all
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:26.680]  the violence the conditioning the dividing us into all these different groups along race religion sex
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:34.440]  but look at europe they say we're going to ban nazi websites oh sounds reasonable to some you
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:40.760]  know nazis are bad then they've got the precedent set and now oh you can't criticize the eu you
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:47.320]  can't criticize gmo food now you can't criticize the town council now the white house says you
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:53.720]  can't criticize groups uh and and so once they set the precedent there they expand it they create
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:59.160]  the perception that guns are illegal with tv ads and billboards showing a picture of a revolver
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:06.040]  or a shotgun legal almost everywhere but a few cities like dc and chicago and they say report
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:10.920]  illegal guns and then your neighbors ignorant i see every few days articles where some old guy
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:14.840]  comes out with his rifle to go to the shooting range neighbors call the cops they pulling him over
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:21.080]  they go ahead and arresting so it's all this perception with this dumbed down population
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:27.400]  and now they're going into the next phase allen's talked a lot about this we're going to get more
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:32.440]  into how they're conditioning us but then i want to get into contestants turn torturers
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:38.520]  in french tv experiment and how they're duplicating give me a document cam shot please the stanford
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:45.240]  prison experiment and we're going to go over that experiment in 71 a team of researchers led by
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:51.880]  psychology professor philip zimbardo at stanford university 24 undergraduates were selected
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:58.200]  out of 70 to play the roles of both guards and prisoners in a mock prison in the basement and
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:02.680]  they told them that we're going to randomly torture them they were told it was real they
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:09.480]  hired actors and they found that the vast majority would murder people and believe they were murdering
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:14.200]  well now there's all these new hollywood movies coming out about torture i saw another one i think
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:19.800]  i sent you the trailer i think it's called uh the final in fact pull up that uh it's on youtube it's
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:28.680]  the top top video right now add uh the final and oh the the kids that aren't cool they they capture
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:33.880]  50 of the other cool kids and they torture them and murder them and it's a great good thing so
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:38.520]  this is the massive conditioning so when our neighbor's being drug away we don't care if we're
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:42.200]  being drug away later and our neighbor won't care when we're drug away because we're all
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:48.440]  being conditioned to it alan one yes in fact there's a movie a very good movie came out in
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:54.200]  germany i called the experiment and that was based on that particular experiment because we're doing
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:58.920]  it in other countries too and it works the same way wherever they do it people see people really
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:04.680]  who don't know themselves that's the old maxim from thousands of years ago know thyself if you
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:10.760]  don't know yourself you immediately get submerged into role playing and you adapt into the role
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:16.600]  and stethomastochism takes over actually even prison guard society but being the prisoners and
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:23.000]  the wardens and um once the the the actors themselves people who take on these roles as
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:28.360]  prisoners once you start talking back to the wardens the wardens literally reacts with anger
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:34.120]  how dare you you're subservient we hate you because you're so compliant you're you're on
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:39.480]  your knees uh this is stethomastochistic behavior and it's also used in the military that's where
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:43.880]  they really got it from when you join the military the first thing they teach you is you're not a
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:49.880]  person anymore an individual you're part of the team all matters is the force and well it's classic
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:55.640]  cult brainwashing they shave your head sleep deprivation uh they torture you and then you're
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:01.400]  no longer a maggot then you're you're now a human because you're part of our group and that's your
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:06.280]  only identity and now in the public schools the terror attack drills where they tell the kids
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:11.000]  it's real uh they tell them it's the gun owners that are doing this it's the conservatives it's
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.880]  the libertarians it's the home schoolers that are going to do this that's why we had to torture you
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:20.920]  that's why we've got to watch you with cameras in the bathroom it's their fault and it and it's
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:25.640]  like all these different syndromes the stock home syndrome they start loving their abuser and and
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:31.000]  take all the FEMA drills and police training and government it's like in your role and when they run
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.880]  terror attacks they do it through a script and so everything becomes role playing if you don't
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:39.880]  have your own identity if you don't have your own moral compass that was taught to you you know
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:45.080]  through your culture don't trust the government never snitch stick together those were truly
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:50.520]  passed on ancient human attributes against tyranny as they remove that yuppies you know
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:57.320]  trendies liberals they're all in a role and they play a role and they're and it's like a three-year-old
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:02.600]  playing princess or playing cowboys and indians and and and i remember when i was three years old
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:08.600]  having a giant paradigm shift in my backyard when me and my friends were playing uh batman and
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:15.160]  robin and i and i get clicked i said i'm playing a role i'm not really batman and i have this
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:19.800]  paradigm understanding that everybody was playing roles and then i never basically did it again do
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:25.800]  you see what i'm saying exactly and people really do become the the the role when they get a job
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:31.160]  they become their job they tend to lose themselves as well mr postman actually becomes mr postman
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:37.720]  and same with mr policeman that they get into this role and they don't think like an ordinary
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:42.920]  individual would ever think again they think that more like a machine the conditioned machines
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:49.880]  same with the military but remember too we run by experts at the top with unlimited financing with
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:56.920]  thousands of think tanks working on every possible uh repercussion for their agenda at every stage
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:03.400]  and the the workouts what read the reactions from the public will be they have risen a generation
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:13.000]  on militarized video games which were intended to desensitize the military from killing or turning
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.960]  on anyone they're told to turn on including their own people if need be and and they've raised them
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:22.680]  with this is that very addictive they know what they're doing and these guys now are the real
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:27.640]  johnny with a gun they're wearing the uniforms and when they're told to turn on their own people
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:35.160]  they will do so well they found exactly they found in in world war one soldiers would shoot
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:40.120]  people a thousand yards away but over half of folks unless they were fighting for their lives
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:46.680]  wouldn't shoot somebody 20 feet away by vietnam with pop-up paper targets to habitualize
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:51.880]  instinctual shooting they got it to where about 90 would pull the trigger up close you know you
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:57.640]  must heighten your killer instinct or you will be dead marine doom the video game was developed over
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:03.960]  15 years ago by the pentagon we talked about this and now they even use the playstation controller
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:10.280]  with the predator drones and they're actually hiring teenagers who have the top scores on these
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:15.800]  pilot programs that they now admit the pentagon funded microsoft and i talked to a high level
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:22.040]  former well he's actually a hollywood producer who for five years worked at the highest levels
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:29.320]  of microsoft and it's all basically a pentagon program to precondition and it was like what
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:33.960]  20 years ago they had the last starfighter put the science fiction thing where where they put
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:39.160]  out these video games to find out who can beat the game then they landed say you're now going to be
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:43.160]  part of the intergalactic starfighters but instead of really working for aliens off world
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:48.280]  that put these video games in the pentagon now admits they are literally getting the best robot
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:55.640]  pilots to to to now be in these trailers in arizona or nevada or new mexico with with with drones
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:02.840]  10 000 miles away and they've been habitualized on very games designed to pre-program them
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:08.440]  yeah they also go through a very specialized testing for the ones who do that and this was
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:14.840]  disclosed in a documentary in britain where the the u.s. nuclear subs are based at the hollyloch
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:22.760]  and the commander of the base was asked how they select the two men aboard every sub who put the
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:28.280]  keys in together they look at the little computers and so on everything's computerized so the little
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:33.720]  figures and so on aren't just continents and aren't just people they're just like cartoons to them
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:38.600]  but he said we select the psychopathic types because they will do what they're told and
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:42.760]  they will turn those keys and they will press those buttons when they're told to do so because
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:48.120]  they can't empathize with other people so they actually have selective courses and tests to get
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:53.960]  the right people who to sit behind as you see in these trailers while they kill hundreds of people
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:58.840]  thousands of miles away that they never even see and they have drill after drill after drill now
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:07.320]  people are asking well how do they know who is the best drone pilot well now almost all the games
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:14.840]  are interactive and so it's all on a database and now the microsoft xbox the playstation with sony
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:20.280]  all these companies admit it's got voice identification infrared face scan they're now
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:26.920]  going to add pain sensors to the games remember what 20 plus years ago that james bond movie
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:31.480]  were their global domination and they're playing the game and and they're getting pain pain
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:37.960]  when they get hit this again it's all pre-programming and they admit it this is not our opinion
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:45.720]  that's right uh people realize that the biggest corporations out there were all funded by the
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:51.800]  government agencies and the legitimate um commercialized corporations they bring up the
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:57.560]  guys like gates to be the frontman they couldn't have competitors with different technologies
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:01.080]  giving it to the public they have to make sure there's one every they're all saying to all the
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:05.880]  movies there can be only one well they make sure that they are the one and they create these
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:12.280]  characters they create real corporations and his father was was was was arming intelligence the top
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:19.000]  board member on the eugenics organization plan parenthood and it's admitted that ibm gave it
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:25.480]  all to him so that they wouldn't have any trust problems and microsoft is a fake spinoff of the
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:31.320]  eugenics corporation ibm yes and the gates family took all the way back to rockefella
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:36.520]  because uh when he killed all the miners and the strike down the states turned the militia loose on
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:42.120]  them uh it they sent in pr guys and gates the relative was one of the pr guys who created
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:48.360]  the new rockefella the philanthropist the man who cared about poor people yeah and now bill gates
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:53.800]  is giving free shots to the people in africa but then he gave a speech and and it's double speak
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:58.840]  to his people that's why the audience laughed the sickos laugh we played the audio and video here
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:03.800]  just a month ago and he says we've got to get everybody's vaccine so we can cut the population
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:09.320]  by half and everyone laughed and clapped it was a it was a sick psycho enjoyment we're saying we're
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:15.480]  killing them out in the open and they don't even see it and it's uh so we're murdering we have power
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:20.360]  trampling and being trampled we're priest of power we're pressing on the nerve what
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:29.080]  we count we're mega deathing we're killing we count yeah and the thing is too there's so is that
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:34.120]  see they are super confident now because the the public have never been so dumb down the general
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:40.440]  public as they are today with scientific means through media all media entertainment and there's
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:46.280]  not a thing you can watch entertainment that isn't full of predictive programming and messages
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:50.840]  and how you should behave and how you should feel about this and feel about that you're giving it
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:56.280]  all and uh they've never had such a dumb down population with the inoculations as they have
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:01.640]  to date 30 30 injections before a child gets out of hospital after getting born i mean and then
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:08.200]  then they're full of uh fluoride from then on so uh we are really working on at less than half
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:16.840]  speed to be honest with you absolutely and why do you think some individuals are predisposed to
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:24.200]  be resistant to this uh versus others that fall right into it a lot of its upbringing genetics
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:30.920]  uh but obviously the most aggressive anti-government anti-territy group in the world were north
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:37.000]  americans just because of the selection of who came here the rebels the criminals uh the trail
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.320]  blazers and so that's why we were the first to be fluoridated we're the first to be targeted
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:45.720]  and then and then we're the beta test if they can do it to us they can do it to anybody and
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:50.120]  they really hate the muslims because they've got their own in those countries kind of old world
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:55.400]  oppressive system in some ways but that's they say one of their biggest threats because they won't
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:46:03.080]  allow in any of the western control and the muslims too you see the whole world is almost
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:08.600]  standardized the whole world's almost standardized the muslims have held out they have an intact
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:14.760]  culture and uh they're autonomous to the extent too they've traditionally never joined the world
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:20.360]  bankers they've never traditionally they never used a usury so they can't get put into massive debt
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:25.400]  that's been changing since the late 80s hundreds but still there are holdouts there uh they don't
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:31.320]  fit in with the globalized standardized system and that's what's all about is standardization
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:37.080]  of a world system across the entire globe uh so anyone who won't go under will be bombed under
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:46.520]  and forced under or simply eradicated all together yeah continue well it's the same thing too with um
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:53.080]  with uh the oil and all the rest of it too we know it's just lining grabs it's mineral grabs
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:58.760]  it's oil grabs not not for our countries because we don't have countries anymore keep on us we're
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:03.400]  run by internationalists and we have been for a long long time but they're making sure that they
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:07.960]  have all these resources for themselves for a hundred years two hundred years in the future
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:15.640]  and i've read the department of defences on projections for the next 50 years they know
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:20.440]  and they published it before the dollar bombed out and the crash came they said there would be
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:25.240]  financial crashes they said there would be food shortages there would be riots as they bring down
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:32.120]  the western world and 2010 to 2012 was it was around the starting date for the actual riots
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:37.240]  well we'll see the riots break out in Greece and other countries there's articles in the paper now
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:41.960]  they're expecting riots in in the uk shortly let's let's talk more about that but let's go back
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:48.920]  you made a big deal out of this in 2007 we realized it was a big deal we wrote articles about it in
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:52.680]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com you did it cut it through the matrix dot com
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:57.320]  blood and guardian reported on it we got the whole hundred page report the british ministry
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:05.400]  of defense program and they they said we're going to financially collapse it uh into 2010
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:11.400]  we're going to have flash mobs riots and they talk about how we are the enemy they talk about
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:19.480]  using nuclear weapons or or the neutron bombs if if the people were to ever try to take back London
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:26.360]  or Ottawa or DC they will neutron bomb the population and they just admit it we're standing by with
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:30.760]  neutron bombs they're public we will kill you and they say there's nothing you can do we're
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:35.320]  going to poison you we're going to sterilize you and if you ever try to take a capital we're going
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:39.800]  to neutron bomb you i mean this is this is and then so the cops the military that serve this
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:44.600]  in the bureaucrats you're drinking deadly poison you're being poisoned with gmo your sperm counts
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:50.360]  dropped 85 percent you're becoming sterile you're dying of cancer and you will salute the government

[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:14.760]  this is a psycho kill grid we're in i'm going to submit i love being a tyrant so you go ahead and
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:21.400]  smash me and also that was followed remember from the guardian and the the department of defense
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:27.400]  for the uk and nato all nato countries followed immediately all the months later by the united
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:33.880]  states military one which was pretty well identical to the british one so this is the world agenda and
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:38.680]  instead the same thing will happen in the united states so this whole force and again with agenda
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:44.680]  21 the agenda for the 21st century which is the century for change plan change of course

[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:00.840]  everyone's to get forced into the already overcrowded cities and they said that 20 years ago they said
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:05.000]  we'll we'll get everybody dependent through the trilateral banking system and then we're
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.640]  going to destroy half of the homes in the cities and detroit is announced they're going to destroy a
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:16.120]  third and they're announcing massive new energy taxes all designed to bankrupt us yes and i also
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:21.640]  took to issue will be to be managed for the next 50 years is to take the system down and if you go
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:26.760]  into the council of foreign relations on website you'll see that they've been they've got think tanks
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:33.000]  the one of their sites one of their links at the full-time think tanks from the cfr on all

[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:24.440]  somewhere between 2015 they believe that with their computer models their predictive systems
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:28.600]  tracking human movements that there will be desperate attempts as people know they're being
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:33.160]  poisoned as they're being killed as they find out it's a eugenics model people will attempt
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:37.880]  primitively to take the capitals the capitals are facades it's the big underground norad
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:45.240]  bases the connu government bases shy and mountain systems like that systems out in colorado springs
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:49.960]  but they will use neutron weapons on you that's a nuke that doesn't destroy the cities it just
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:56.520]  kills all life it's a radiation burst weapon they say you're going to have a brain chip to have a job
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:00.280]  that people will have to accept it just to have a job it's like oh it's free market you don't have
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:05.240]  to be here but you'll starve to death they talk about flash mobs how they're going to control us
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:09.560]  their new world order their world government and you can read the hundred plus page report they
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:14.840]  have a link to it in this article and if it's not linked to now ask watson he could pull up the
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:20.280]  actual british ministry of defense report us government report i mean folks i had a primitive
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.800]  level get excited and try to warn you i mean i'm a fellow human i want freedom i want to be happy
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:30.680]  i want a good future i want to build and work together and go to space these control freaks
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:36.040]  don't so alan can calmly talk about it he's a great guide me i mean i mean it's like we know
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:42.120]  these are mastermind criminals we know what they're doing we're not lying to you and you need to check
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:46.280]  out what we're saying and then no one in the government or the military the police should
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:50.680]  serve these people you're with us the people even if you think you're part of the system
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:55.640]  alan isn't that the biggest trick is that people that serve the system feel like they're on the
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:56:03.240]  winning team it's a fact it's also a technique and a science in it all in itself it's called
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:08.040]  obedience to authority uh the same technique the use in the military your party the team
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:14.760]  i'm too important to to be discarded that kind of stuff and it's worked through the soviet system
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:20.280]  well tested tried to lots of books written on it obedience to authority so but what they don't
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:24.760]  realize is once is for instance look at all the bureaucrats you have to take care of millions
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:29.560]  or billions of people once they've reduced the population they won't need the bureaucrats so
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:35.080]  they're next to go as well you won't need all the cops out there or the military if you wipe out
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:40.200]  most of the planet so what's probably going they won't keep you around as a pet believe you me these
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:46.920]  guys are all but economics and what seems to be appropriate at the time and if you are you if they
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:52.440]  claim that you are eating out the resources that their future offspring the leech future offspring
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:57.400]  will have for the next thousand years they're going to get rid of you very quickly if they don't need
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:04.920]  you everyone is used in turn here every organization out there is used in turn the communists
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:10.440]  organizations are all used in turn the right wingers as well um and they don't realize that
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:17.080]  they're all used in turn all deserve to serve and bring about the same agenda which is simply
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:22.760]  the elite survival this goes back to the Darwinist philosophy is the whole philosophy to do with
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:29.000]  Darwinism to do with eugenics survival of the fittest and whereas we can talk about psychopaths
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:35.240]  has been almost alien to our mentality from us because they have no empathy for other people
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:40.440]  they're very cunning they're like cameras that watch and study you emulate you and are very
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:46.520]  good con men but they feel nothing for you well in the Darwinist philosophy they are the natural
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:52.840]  successors to take over and rule the world and keep it for themselves they believe that they are
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:58.200]  the most advanced predators on the planet and they're not ashamed of being predators they think
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:04.680]  that's a natural order so predators who are ruthless will always survive and that's what they
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:10.120]  discuss at the top think tanks and we can't recognize them because what maybe one out of
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.760]  a hundred people is a psychopath maybe five out of a hundred is a sociopath but they're
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:20.920]  conditioning the public to artificially create psychopaths and sociopaths and it's come out
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:24.440]  in government documents most of the chemical and biological testing where they kill our own
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:31.960]  troops and people isn't to test the chemicals or biologicals it's to test their scientist to see who
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:38.360]  enjoys killing people who believes in justifies the means to take them as cedars to then create

[01:59:53.640 --> 01:59:58.840]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:21.880]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:27.400]  this is what is so frustrating we're gonna put the pdf up on screen a little bit later of the
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:31.560]  actual greatest government document it's one of literally thousands that say the same thing
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:39.000]  they talk about us how we're animals how they're manipulating us how they're controlling us and
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:44.120]  when you have all these admissions of what they're doing and how they want to kill the majority of
[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:49.640]  us and then the public argues with you oh the government wouldn't kill 3000 on 9 11 oh the
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:55.800]  government wouldn't stage gulf atonkin it's just asinine we're gonna go to calls coming up in the
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:00.440]  next segment but ellen you've hit upon the key here it's this predatory mindset they believe it's
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:07.080]  a virtue it's like a wolf killing a sheep they the wolf doesn't feel guilty this is what it's
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:12.200]  doing and how do we get people to recognize the scientific and technological elite takeover that
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:18.040]  eisenhower warned us about how do we let them understand that there is a group watching and
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:24.200]  manipulating us like we are bacteria in a petri dish only by getting outside the control paradigm
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:30.920]  seeing the larger picture can people have any chance of stopping this uh but they've trained
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:37.320]  the slaves to giggle and laugh and be delusional where if they laugh something off that makes it
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:44.600]  not exist and and and and laugh at their utter destruction it's that but it's also if we're
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:49.800]  going to understand something most people don't know there's been a war on their cultural values
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:55.560]  for well over a hundred years i'm incomplete all out war by the media by entertainment
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:02:03.400]  by all the so-called lefties that work together with the the boys at the top and the first thing
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:10.040]  is said in the late 1800s hg well said this we must destroy the family unit that was taken up
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:17.800]  from the fabian society to the marxist groups that became a prime tenet of the communist manifestos
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:23.160]  well the structure of the family unit everything that stood in the way of takeover uh as a group
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:27.800]  or which is really a small clan you stand up for your relatives and for those you love if they can
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:33.800]  destroy all that and better and rustle pretty better he said if we can create an ego centonic
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:39.800]  and egocentric narcissistic society where everyone is in love with themselves they'll stand up for
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:44.520]  no one therefore the government can rule each person right down to them and no one will stand
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:50.520]  up to defend them if we go for them is that and i want you to talk more about that but
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:56.360]  they also create counterfeits for different personality types they know psychos and sociopaths
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:00.760]  will buy into the narcissism and go ahead and abort their babies or go ahead and let the cps
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:05.480]  take their kid because the kid was trouble anyways and who cares that my neighbor's being drug away
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:10.120]  he had a nicer car than i did or oh i love being an environmentalist we're gonna shock it to the
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:16.120]  business owners with more taxes you know this rat like mentality but for gracious good people who
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:21.480]  are centered and realize we should be giving and should have honor and courage and should be informed
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:26.440]  and be involved in community and stand up for our fellow man and that we're all part of a larger
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:33.480]  species they come in with fake liberal and altruistic systems to then take the best of us and get us
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:39.480]  working for them towards their goals so they so they've typecast everything and have different
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:44.200]  media different strata different propaganda different niches different subgroups and they
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:50.840]  write all about it even in the 20s uh with uh you know the fellow that wrote the book propaganda
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:57.400]  i mean it's just it's all uh ever bernays it's just all there and we're here desperately telling
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:03.240]  people yes i knew that stuff from bernays in the 1800s with the book called the crowd
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:07.880]  and he studied he was studied he was taught by experts from a from childhood for his role by the
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:12.840]  way uh so he understood that through scientific indoctrination they could create the kind of
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:17.960]  society that they wanted uh helpless actually helpless they wouldn't even know that we're
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:23.720]  helpless in fact but they'd be very happy and rockefeller said it himself he said the people
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:29.240]  will come to us with perfect uh docility at the end when you take it all away from the public
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:35.800]  and give us a substitute system uh that can be done for most people most people cannot think for
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:41.720]  themselves uh they live in plateaus caves they can only parrot with each one parrots from the media
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:46.440]  and because they're all parroting the same things uh they think they're sane they actually think
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:53.000]  they're sane and they're living in a false paradigm this is key this is key alan watt a big part of

[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:08.840]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:17.000]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network okay i've got a really good memory but it's not perfect
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:25.240]  no one's is unless it's the bored mind of the computer system that's full of mistakes but it's
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:29.960]  like yesterday i was up on air talking about pentagon technology to get the heat resonance
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:35.080]  biometric print of your body or even the your shoulders in the top of your head and i got an
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:40.440]  email saying alex they can't brain scan you from orbit people got confused by that i was
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:46.680]  reading a bbc article from what five years ago about 25 meters away they can brain scan you
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:53.400]  and they're putting these up was also cbs news then i went into identification biometric systems of
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:58.760]  how you walk from the ground satellites that can identify you once they have your heat resonance
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:03.960]  print of your shoulders in the top of your head from orbit okay that is admitted so people get
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:09.400]  confused by that now i was going from memory on this dc dc global strategic trends program
[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:17.560]  2007 2036 here's the london guardian revolution flash mobs brain ships a grim vision of the
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:22.040]  future i need to get paul watson steve watson erin dykes curt nemo somebody one of my great
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:26.600]  writers researchers to go through this report three years later and show how much of what they
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:35.400]  talked about that would start happening by 2010 has now begun okay and but in here i had a search
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:41.160]  in the pdf file it's a hundred something pages the term neutron weapons and they did find it
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:45.640]  but it talks about how they may be used to end war kind of what bertrand russell was saying of
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:49.880]  we'll use nuclear war to knock out all our enemies and then have an age of peace so it must be the
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:54.360]  us version of this or perhaps even a pina because i know i've read it and did a story about it
[02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:58.280]  where they talk about we'll use neutron bombs against populations and they try to take over
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:04.040]  the government so we need to ferret that out because again these things all mimic each other
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:08.920]  and are very similar we're going to go to calls here but alan watt you were getting into the
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:17.000]  narcissism how they train people to not care i've read roman historians who wrote about
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:23.400]  the fact that early on in rome they didn't have gladiatorial events and that they scientifically
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:27.640]  as a way to dehumanize and so people would put up with tyranny first it was convicted
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:32.200]  hardcore criminals had to fight then it was old slaves then it was basically everybody then it
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:36.920]  was your neighbor next week and as long as the public could cheer for somebody being torn apart
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:42.120]  this week that dehumanized everyone and made them enjoy seeing their fellow humans killed
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:46.760]  next week it would probably be them and that things got worse and worse as the empire declined
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:54.040]  they did this consciously 2000 plus years ago right through their fall in 410 to the visigoth
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:59.400]  chieftain aurek uh and and and so this is a much more i mean they had scientific control
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:09.160]  2000 years ago the greeks had it 2500 years ago continue yes and what you find too is that the
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:15.560]  authors who worked for the fabian society which is just an arm is a specialized arm to control
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:21.720]  left wing for the socialized world of the brain in on behalf of the elite tried to was all started
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:27.000]  up by the elite themselves and funded by them and they're all issue of international affairs
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:32.520]  they're all branches specialized branches of the same thing and you'll find that their authors
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:38.120]  have talked about this this particular age we're in today one of them was arnold arnold
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:43.240]  toinby a professor at oxford he was the one who taught road scholars for world government on behalf
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:49.240]  of the elite and he said his own history books is a philosopher and historian he said that these
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:53.720]  are this is what happens at the end of an age when an empire is going down now the elite always
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:59.080]  move out before the empire crashes by the way you never see that the rich people get put under and
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:05.880]  you have they bring homosexuality to the fore lesbianism party party party for the for the
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:10.440]  wealthy elites and then the rest emulate that too they have fewer and fewer children they've
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:15.480]  infanticide it becomes very common and so they know the techniques of bringing down the society
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:21.400]  everybody's partying having fun entertainment drama plays staged as never before and it says
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:27.160]  that this can be re-implemented at any time in any culture in any empire and in the same as
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:33.000]  long as you bring in the same formula and sequence you can recreate that and bring the people down
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:38.920]  to basically a slave level and now that was also said by carol quickly professor carol quickly
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:44.200]  who was a historian for the council and formulations and he taught at the u.s. state department he
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:51.080]  sought the diplomats and he also taught guys in the pentagon so they use knowledge as over weapons
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:56.440]  knowledge is power and it can be weaponized if you understand the techniques and the formulas
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:13:01.160]  to reintroduce the same sequences you can bring people down and as you control them
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:07.320]  every stage of the way and today we have nothing today we're living as like Sodom and Gomorrah
[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:14.600]  a regular television now is basically pornography they're bringing up live simulated sex shows
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:23.080]  on british morning tv this kind of stuff it's hard this is the key to to break all natural
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:29.400]  bonding rules that creates a strong cultural society and it starts really with a man and
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:34.040]  the woman as a first target you divide them you conquer them you then separate the children
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:40.120]  the state we have the children with new values which are all politically correct every intake
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:48.360]  in kindergarten is taught to a scientific formula so that the intake in the previous year are given
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:53.400]  the a little upgrade from the previous year before them for what they will expect to happen
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:58.520]  culturally in society in their lifetime so that when it happens they think it's normal and
[02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:05.960]  Beria who was a KGB or NKVD head of the Soviet Union in 1934 at the international communist
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:12.920]  meeting talked about this they said it takes 70 years to alter society in a cultural way to our
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:20.120]  advantage now we said in 1934 it takes five years through indoctrination of the intakes of children
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:26.760]  today is down to year by year by year through kindergarten it's a scientific indoctrination
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:30.760]  so that they'll get brought up in a world where yet brain chipping will be normal
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:37.720]  hemathecitic beings cloned in laboratories will be normal all kinds there'll be no such
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:44.680]  thing as pedophilia anymore that's another big goal this destruction of all normalcy means you
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:50.200]  are defenseless against the big boys because you have no cultural values to hold on to and stand up
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:56.280]  for when you can't stand up for anything you are totally defeated you're now a blank slate
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:02.680]  that they can program anything they want into you're an empty hard drive yeah now i want to go over
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:07.960]  this and then we're going to calls i mentioned this last hour contestants turned torturers in
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:15.160]  french tv game show experiment and here's the stanford experiment from 71 where the professors
[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:22.760]  themselves went crazy with the mock prison and torture and even began actually trying to hurt
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:28.120]  people and kill people and they were telling people to mock executions that they thought were real
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:35.080]  and they were actually carrying it out because of the mad crazy power trip and and and this was
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:44.440]  almost 40 years ago ladies and gentlemen this was 39 years ago think of how far they've taken
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:51.720]  us now i want to play a fox news clip of this torture show where we're all being taught it's
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:59.000]  beautiful and wonder roses aren't beautiful beautiful green fields beautiful oceans love innocence
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:05.160]  honor it's not good death destruction blood torture this is what's beautiful this is what's
[02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:11.560]  good this is your power your power to hate and kill and to give support to killing an evil
[02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:19.400]  culture by design so we're defenseless virtue sovereignty is is the antidote states rights
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:23.320]  cutting the size of government not putting your children in government training camps
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:27.880]  warning everyone you know getting upset getting through the comfort zone breaking out of your
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:34.040]  bubbles realizing how serious and real this is and that everything else you're being programmed
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:38.840]  with is is is fake what's real is the government think tanks what's real is the documents what's
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:43.960]  real is what's really happening not the false spectrum analysis projected on you that is
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:49.160]  literally a matrix like system that we're now digitally television all going now to 3d which
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:54.920]  they admit is total mind control makes you mentally ill just total programming drugging
[02:16:54.920 --> 02:17:00.120]  the water supply we're deep into this technological dictatorship right now let's go to this clip
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:07.240]  he shows well it is that and then some french producers actually mocked up a game show contestants
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:13.320]  were posed questions if they got them wrong they're commanded to throw a switch and a zap
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:19.960]  a fellow on literally on the hot seat now it appears that he gets hit with electricity upwards of
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:27.480]  oh 420 volts worth all the while the audience of this game show shouting punish him punish him
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:48.840]  take a look and listen is our contestants and audience are real they think the game is real
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:53.640]  the guy on the hot seat is an actor he is faking it and faking it very well it looks like he's
[02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:58.760]  almost about to die and here is the punchline i saved the headline for last john while some
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:05.240]  of the contestants said no they would not participate in this 82% said yes and pulled the switch
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:11.960]  pretty bizarre tv experiment what's the reaction well producers are defending it they say they're
[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:17.880]  just updating a psychological experiment which was actually run in the united states about 50 years
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:23.560]  ago but france is taking a back i spoke to one top commentator and his words to me are it was
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:29.240]  stupid it was crazy all right let's stop papers are delivering last week georgian state controlled
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:35.480]  tv broadcasts the russians had invaded again they never invaded to begin with they have simulated
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:40.840]  cyber attacks simulated terror attacks they announced on us tv it's fake only at the beginning
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:47.880]  all of this world the world psychological brainwashing this is done so people associate torture
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:54.280]  as fun that's why they brought out the abu graham torture was to get you ready to accept it now police
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:59.640]  all over the world are taught pain compliance and a federal court and a state court of ruled police
[02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:06.360]  can now break arms and taser you to answer questions without a warrant ellen what yes in fact there's
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:10.680]  come out in different court hearings or as they can court hearings i don't think he can go to court
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:18.360]  when it takes people and kill them that's uh the police were now using tasers for compliance compliance
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:22.200]  is that that's what's all about now compliance you comply you do what you're told there's no such
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:28.840]  thing as rights anymore you're taught to simply obey or else but uh say no masochistic techniques

[02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:26.520]  going to just kill in mass alan watts our guests want to go to alex shannon dirk kay tim and others
[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:35.800]  but alan i see a blurring of reality and fiction with all these fake drills or uh russia attacked
[02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:43.000]  georgia they it was a lie two years ago it's a lie now when they ran the newscast nationwide the
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:48.040]  people are very angry in georgia they have all these tv shows that where they don't tell you
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:53.080]  it's real or not they announced they've captured an al-qaeda leader sometimes 14 15 times never
[02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:58.680]  retract the last time they're scientifically setting the precedent where they just lie and deceive all
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:06.440]  the time yes a technique too because you see this is the um it's a war of terror not on
[02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:11.800]  terror it's a war of terror you always use terroristic techniques on the vast population
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:17.000]  when you're drastically changing quickly into a new system and you want that for again for
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:21.720]  obedience and compliance and that's what we're seeing happening now but when you see there's
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:27.400]  so many television series out now on terrorism terrorism and government agencies dealing with
[02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:32.680]  it all it's all so far-fetched and crazy scenarios but people are laughing that stuff up they can't
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:38.360]  tell fact from fiction anymore um they see the guys in the streets of the combat boots the cops
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:44.280]  and the rest of it is all quite normal to them and what happens is uh you you get into a state of
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:50.920]  flux they call it flux at the top where you can't rationalize reality and separate it from fiction
[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:56.680]  and use your own perceptions is to say am i really under attack right now or is it mainly in my head
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:26:01.640]  but all the symbols are giving you is that they're under attack you're under attack comply obey obey
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:07.720]  and you can rush forward a whole agenda with rationing uh fuel rationing which will come to
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:12.440]  as it is off the roads gradually into the new system and as they're doing it yes they will
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:18.040]  step up the decadence within society because when in the fuel systems they knew that when they brought
[02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:23.640]  out someone who'd fought against them a hero like michael um like william wallis for instance
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:29.720]  the peasantry would turn up living in their own misery and they would actually hate someone who
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:34.600]  tried and failed and they watched them being drawn and quadruped and sliced up in a ritualistic
[02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:41.480]  killing on behalf of the king and they cheer because they hate the losers the public hate to
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:46.680]  losers they know within themselves that losers themselves and they transfer it on to the victim
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:51.640]  who stood up and had the guts to stand up but actually lost this is the same technique they're
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:57.720]  showing you now uh you're they're telling you you're nobody you're weak obey and maybe survive
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:03.000]  if you don't obey you definitely will not survive because we'll get you that's the message now
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:09.240]  and they've borrowed all the terms that they used to use in the soviet union like um political
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:16.520]  correctness is a great translation from them uh so so is um hate crime governments anti-government
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:22.200]  any statement any criticism of any policy at all is is called out your anti-governments
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:29.160]  and they're trying to opposition party is the most anti-government party around well we love our
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:32.760]  country we fear and don't like our government if we have common sense here are some of the
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:38.840]  headlines because senich kisses the ring as obama deceptively sells to talitarian care in
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:45.960]  ohio uh kesinich sells out on health care after ride in air force one when i saw that photo yesterday
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:51.880]  i knew kesinich had sold out with obama smiling triumphantly he's the type of psycho that hates
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:59.400]  america hates good people he they enjoy destroying you they enjoy making you poor and now this medical
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:05.880]  tyranny that does have the ration care does have the death panels it's all coming in now alan
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:10.680]  um not many years you also get to compulsory sterilization that will be on the books because
[02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:16.200]  look who's up there mr holdren that wrote the book with the paul erlich paul erlich's wife is a high
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:21.560]  member of the trilateral commission in council for relations and they wrote about that years ago
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:27.240]  that they would bring in mandatory sterilization for the unfit and that's coming down yeah yeah
[02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:31.320]  they're saying now look at this mother that had a genetic problem is she had a kid we need
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:36.360]  pre screening to to license you to have kids and then oh we have been taking your blood at birth
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:42.520]  for the pentagon for 37 years globally it started 37 years ago we were in a world government 37
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:49.640]  years ago yeah we were and again generations haven't even known it but the big uh apart from the
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:56.360]  federal reserve getting treated and back in the early world war one uh despite it be no world war
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:01.640]  one if it wasn't for that being created but the fact is when when fdr gave you the new deal that
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:06.360]  was the announcement of this is the new way this is a new system this is the superstition
[02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:11.320]  the constitution's out the window and the bankers and so on we're running the show that was there's
[02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:17.960]  a legal declaration yeah absolutely and he declared the war powers act in 33 and put the
[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:23.400]  country into a permanent emergency and that's what we're still under today yeah so i've never
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:29.560]  had such a thing as there was a republic in the u.s that's been wiped out by the cfrs on waiters
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:34.840]  and their own magazine uh the foreign affairs said that we'll do an end run around the constitution
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:39.480]  otherwise ignore it and go around the they've done the spp documents say we're gonna set up a
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:43.960]  north american union by stealth okay i promise we're going right to your calls out of this break

[02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:14.440]  are not gods they're not invincible they're organized they control the issuance of currency and
[02:33:14.440 --> 02:33:20.120]  credit we can take back our town councils in england our counties our cities in the united
[02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:26.760]  states and canada by education by showing people the false reality that they've been living in
[02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:33.640]  and educating them about tyrants of history and now this is a high-tech version we can cut big
[02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:42.120]  government we can support the family we can trust in our creator to lead god and direct us not the
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:48.760]  big organized religion there is a big awakening happening and the globalists are trying to manipulate
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:54.440]  that and control that but their global warming taxes are in trouble record numbers didn't take
[02:33:54.440 --> 02:33:59.000]  the swine flu shot or the seasonal flu so we had record low flu that was in wall street journal
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:02.840]  because it's the shot that gives you the flu all the evidence shows the people are trying to get
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:08.200]  healthier that's why they're trying to wreck all the agriculture and industry where you are totally
[02:34:08.200 --> 02:34:13.320]  dependent on them so even if you're awake there's nothing you can do and we're very close to entering
[02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:19.560]  a time when it's going to be even harder to beat these people but i see a lot of positive things
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:24.440]  happening alan what do you what do you see on the positive front and we're going to calls
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:30.680]  well i think people will be standing up more on an individualistic basis as you know groups are
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:36.840]  penetrated so darn quickly and taken over very very quickly uh because they've put unlimited
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:41.960]  financing at the top and unlimited agents basically to go and do that i got reports here if i'm
[02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:47.800]  doing it in canada recently as well and living undercover with the far left groups and this
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:55.000]  in britain too out of control in austin they just out of control operations here in austin
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:59.640]  but it's having no effect and people are seeing through them yes and that's the key to it if
[02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:04.600]  you retain your individuality and you you mix with different people you think you're a group
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:10.120]  wherever you see it veer off from its its initial intent then you know you've been taken over you've
[02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:15.240]  got to uh and then you leave it you don't submerge yourself and lose yourself within the group you
[02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:20.920]  must always think as an individual and keep uh your mind on track that's the key to everything
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:26.200]  and the boys at the top now here's the thing too they've taught us to think that everything is
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:31.960]  fair and that we live in a some kind of democracy where everyone gets to say and those who make the
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:38.200]  most sense will always win the big boys at the top do not and never have played by any fair rules
[02:35:38.200 --> 02:35:43.720]  if you want power and you want to maintain power you don't play by the rules that's why they don't
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:48.120]  care if they're caught out with all their lives to continue regardless as though they've never
[02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:52.920]  heard you and they're they'll stick to nothing to get their way if it's blowing up buildings
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:59.160]  or a whole city they will do it if need be if need be and go to understand that never to panic
[02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:04.280]  when we see these things come down down the pike and that's why they're so i agree with you that's
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:08.920]  why they're so angry at 911 truth and demonizing and everywhere because we've taken their toy
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:13.560]  of false flag terror and now people are automatically thinking is it the government
[02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:21.080]  kibono who stands to gain and it's really angering them it's angering them and that puts so much
[02:36:21.080 --> 02:36:26.920]  money out and groups again and try groups you might say and propaganda from the pentagon
[02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:32.200]  through various agencies appears independent news clips and i've read articles from the pentagon
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:37.800]  where they actually do this to brainwash the public and try and poo poo it and these silly
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:43.240]  radicals with the crazy paranoid ideas and repetition of language like that that's what
[02:36:43.240 --> 02:36:49.560]  they hope to to win over the general public with the general public unfortunately as i say you cannot
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:58.440]  live in in reality if you're consuming daily television fiction fiction is not fiction to
[02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:03.160]  entertain you is there to indoctrinate you and i've lost count i'll try to keep track of all
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:09.160]  the shows that come out since all the messages the anti-family anti-gun anti-home school
[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:16.200]  anti-free market anti-pro world government all the messages and cartoons about the illuminati
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:21.800]  making it a joke i'm going to make this point and go to calls you mentioned how they create mass
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:29.480]  insanity where people accept mass murder war torture human sacrifice look at the romans look
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:36.040]  at the Aztecs look at the druids where oh the sun won't come back during an eclipse if you don't
[02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:41.000]  give us your children to sacrifice that oh every culture does this they make you give over your
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:46.760]  children to be burned in fires or flayed or have their hearts cut out because if they can make you
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:53.400]  do that willfully they have full mind control over you so human culture always ends up getting
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:58.520]  dominated by the psychopaths and they turn the world into the type of world they like death
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:05.000]  destruction torture and killing it's one percent of the population we've got to identify them
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:11.400]  educate the virtuous and and good and the mighty to rise up and be the leaders they are to defeat
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:17.080]  this scum do you agree with me alan it's about one percent of psychos i'd say there's a bit more
[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:22.680]  than that the lead to be breeding for a couple of thousand years at least probably three with
[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:27.800]  winners in other words those who dominated that the male is married to a female is the offspring
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:33.080]  of some warlord or whatever and they continue to enter breeding with more sex what they call
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:38.840]  successful people ruthless people until you have generations of them and the psychopathic
[02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:44.040]  they also recruit lesser psychopaths and who are not born into such high power to serve them
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:49.640]  and their actual idiot savants of like this dark mathematics or logic and they talk about it
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:54.360]  i mean a lot of them don't even have to think to do all these evil duplicitous things it just flows
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:39:01.720]  through them it does flow through the psychopath they look at a problem and the they'll immediately
[02:39:01.720 --> 02:39:06.280]  see what seems to them to be the natural straight stroke solution to it it doesn't matter if it
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:11.480]  means killing off a bunch of people in the way as long as you solve the problem it's very very easy
[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:17.000]  for them there's no mental qualms they don't have guilty consciences they're very good at problematic
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:24.200]  and that's why the final test for special forces uh at delta level is mackey of ellies the prince
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:30.920]  injustifies the means and if you say no i don't believe it injustifies the means say kill a whole
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:36.360]  village to blame it on your political enemy if you say no they go oh you passed we're going to
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:41.720]  put you in the bureaucracy somewhere else you're the type of good guy we want you're going to be in
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:47.320]  you know procurement now but the ones that say they will kill people and who are innocent they
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:51.960]  say you understand the greater good you're going to be promoted now that's right that's a nobody
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:57.560]  they call it the noble lie whatever you do must be through deception over the public and it's called
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:03.480]  the noble it's for the greater good the noble lie same thing and this technique is as well understood
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:09.720]  at the top and they do employ lots of psychopathic people to carry it out who are well paid by the way
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:16.120]  and then you get the stringers you see the pentagon back in the 40s joined with academia
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:21.720]  portraying the public along certain directions of thought and an academia is completely politically
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:26.440]  correct and that came out three months ago in the un document that all the major universities
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:33.080]  went to un meetings hookers meals everything for the world government to get them all involved
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:39.320]  they know the environment carbon dioxide isn't bad they know they know it's about bringing in a
[02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:44.200]  communist collective world state and it's all there and they did the psychological test of
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:48.520]  these people they hate their fellow man i mean i see somebody doing well and happy
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:53.640]  or someone with a beautiful wife i am happy for them it's like i'm seeing something good
[02:40:53.640 --> 02:41:00.680]  like a sunset i appreciate wholesomeness to them they see you healthy happy successful they hate it
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:08.520]  or they hated all rights and and uh an academia really is a a form of totalitarianism believe
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:13.240]  in me if you rock the boat with an academia you're out right away if you don't go along with the
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:18.760]  agenda you're demoted or you're out the door very very quickly they all know this they smell the wind
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:24.200]  and they're really in it for their personal gain most of them they don't care who they're brainwashing
[02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:28.520]  or what they're taught to brainwash the youngsters with they will go along with it quite happily
[02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:33.240]  because the psychopathic themselves and they're very well paid as well self interest rules rules
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:42.760]  them what percentage would you say are genetic psychopaths versus the psychopathoid uh biological
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:48.120]  android version through the conditioning in the media what percentage are natural psychos versus
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:57.560]  quasi uh horde of hell servant wraith i'd say probably at the the ruling elites level you're
[02:41:57.560 --> 02:42:05.160]  probably looking only at about maybe uh 20 000 very important families in a descending order
[02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:09.640]  but remember in a psychopathic culture and that's what we've had since the funeral of the agent
[02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:15.720]  and before every psychopath get to the top through viciousness and cruelty and slaughter
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:21.960]  and and stealing and uh but they always give you in the system they give you to dominate you
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:28.840]  they also give you a psychopathic culture which we follow we follow and to dog eat dog etc
[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:34.680]  and and and that again divides us further but there's a triple triple mode there just within
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:39.480]  that one layer of programming they train their people to be ruthless they'll always protect
[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:43.800]  them and slaughtering dominating but then the public is taught to love the torture when it's
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:48.680]  being done to them or others but that they've got to be weak and disarmed and servile well
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:53.560]  here's the key to it to controlling the masses as i said earlier the masses would turn up in the
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:59.080]  village or the or the city of london to to watch someone being hung drawn and quartered in their
[02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:04.680]  in their stomach pulled open in their guts ripped out and they cheer on because the masses who feel
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:09.320]  helpless and under fear themselves and one step from poverty i mean utter poverty or
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:15.800]  starvation will project themselves being helpless into that victim and it's a it's a
[02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:20.840]  actually a symbolic ritual of the death of the self and and that's what you're cheering on
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:25.720]  you hate your life so much that you hate the person who tried and lost and you lose yourself
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:30.360]  but there's also a mirror there where you imagine yourself as the elite at that moment
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:36.520]  you're scum but you're finally having a victory by crime stopping and joining with it yes because
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:41.560]  they found again in a psychopathic culture which they give you and they always generally give you
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:46.520]  the the soviet or the nazi model because it's the most recent in our age for such an organized
[02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:53.720]  culture uh the junior officers around or the officers around hitler literally were psychopathic
[02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:58.920]  they admired the man at the top who has more power than themselves they worship him like a god
[02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:06.120]  but those beneath them they treat with with a descending um disdain to the to the lower officers
[02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:11.720]  because they got less power than themselves so a seed of masochistic behavior always is wrapped
[02:44:11.720 --> 02:44:17.320]  up with the with the psychopathic personality absolutely and it makes them feel powerful
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:22.200]  to see innocent people torn to bits let's take calls alex in illinois thanks for holding her on
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:28.280]  the air yeah hi alex thanks for taking my call i love your work hi alan uh you're doing great
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:33.400]  work out there too so i think you both and god bless both you and your families now my question
[02:44:33.400 --> 02:44:39.320]  is for alan but um after sitting on hold and listening to you guys talking so many important
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:44.680]  issues and such a short time and such a seamless matter i just wanted to bring up a quick point
[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:50.520]  to uh it's a young sentence or it's a young sentence from a young i'm sorry it's a quick
[02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:54.040]  sentence from a young artillery's captain letter home on the last day of world war one
[02:44:54.840 --> 02:44:59.000]  and it closes follows it is a shame we can't go into devastate germany and cut off a few
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:03.880]  the dutch kids hands and feet and scalp a few of their old men but i guess it'll be better to make
[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:08.920]  them work for france and belgium for 50 years now that was sent home on the last day of of world
[02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:13.720]  war one by by harry truman nonetheless so when he's asked is it a tough decision from the drop to
[02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:19.960]  bomb i think we know the cycle paths were dealing less um but now it's my question um alan um on
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:23.480]  the internet and i heard you talking about how they're going to shut it down and alex you know
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:29.160]  it talks about shutting it down do you think that this has anything to do with the next presidential
[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:34.680]  election because i know that um an internet candidate has been predicted by i think it was
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:39.160]  jerry coursey for the next election so i'm wondering if we're having such a huge impact on
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:43.080]  the internet where they can't let it well let's be clear they're not going to shut it off overnight
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:48.120]  they're going to transmute it over into an unfree web we have their cyber security program alan
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:54.520]  what if that's right they need you to be on the internet because you don't realize they gave it
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:46:00.120]  to you to monitor you and to do sub routines and see what groups of you mix with and see what you
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:05.560]  have in common and they actually have read the articles where the pentagon has a virtual reality
[02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:11.160]  world set up in a massive computer supercomputer a computer with every one of us in it and they
[02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:16.840]  updated daily from the day it's got 93 percent predictability of where you're going to do
[02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:23.560]  where you're going what you're going to buy and they say 93 percent that's washington post bbc
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:29.960]  it's probably much higher this is literally a crystal ball they have go ahead and real
[02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:35.960]  time too is in real time uh is instantly trans uploaded into their sites whatever you're doing
[02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:40.280]  who you're corresponding to what you're buying what you're talking about so they have their pulse
[02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:45.800]  on the public and alan that's why it's such a joke they go oh is the government spying on me
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:51.000]  without warrants of course they are and then others will say because they admit they're
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:56.120]  feeding everything in and others will why are we on the web then we are going into the matrix
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:00.680]  you know picture it as people plugged into the matrix but it's it's really a physical interface
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:07.240]  through the eyes which is a computer a plug-in folks your eyes into the tv into the computer
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:13.240]  into the ears you are plugged into a matrix and we're literally like that ship coming in
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:18.360]  and jacking in and going in to get people that's literally what's happening of course the internet
[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:23.160]  is evil and built by darpa of course it's the worldwide wire tap to dehumanize but people say
[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:27.480]  well then why are you there that's where the war is we're blasting in every direction we're waking
[02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:32.040]  a lot of people up but the enemy actually sees alan wadden and i and i'll see if he agrees
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:37.000]  as part of another war game program they're playing against us and learning and getting better with
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:42.440]  their computers and their experts on how to understand and track people and see how we're
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:46.680]  going to move and what movements are going to happen to be 10 steps ahead of us to try to
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:51.640]  take that over the key here is reaching through to people who aren't psychopaths in the system
[02:47:51.640 --> 02:47:56.600]  and asking them do you realize the bigger picture do you see the larger matrix do you
[02:47:56.600 --> 02:48:02.680]  really want to be part of this and i think in that lays the key alan what exactly you see
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:07.800]  rucker fellow himself talked about the window of opportunity to bringing this world agenda through
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:14.360]  well the internet to me and yourself i'm sure is just our window of opportunity while we have it
[02:48:14.920 --> 02:48:20.280]  and they are closing down and see the british empire it still exists today canza dominion of
[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:25.880]  london basically as it was australia they're using a new censorship government run censorship
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:32.120]  techniques on their servers all servers have to join it and under the guise of course also
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:36.600]  pedophilia but there's too many well there's more pedophilia acts up there in governments
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:41.960]  and the british system and there are people who are not so it's not so the users excuse
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:47.400]  and the first site the attack was a christian site that mentioned the word abortion because it's
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:53.240]  politically incorrect to say that's right they're banning they're banning dental office websites
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:49:00.120]  christian sites in australia and to set the precedent they can ban anything and literally it's
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:05.000]  like all the tsa employees keep getting caught raping kids of course who do you think the global
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:10.280]  is higher they look at your internet traffic they know you're a pedophile and so when you go to
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:15.160]  uh uh become a homeland security person you're going right to the top because they already
[02:49:15.160 --> 02:49:19.960]  know you're one of them that's right and you're blackmailable too should you ever turn against

[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:06.920]  they might as well be reptilians from planet pop tart because they're so anti human and so different

[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:17.720]  has been blown out of proportion deliberately it's actually used in psychology when they talk about
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:24.280]  part of the brain where basic survival functions are in all animals and reptiles it's your survival
[02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:30.040]  that sex violence eating fighting to survive that's what they call the reptilian part well
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:35.240]  it's true the psychopath lives on that part of the brain uh they're egos and tyke mean if they
[02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:39.640]  want something they'll do it regardless of rules regulations or cultural norms if they want that

[02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:11.480]  whimper or a bang uh that's that's a definitely have no option we have no you're very survival
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:16.760]  and all this decent and good in humanity has been around for an awful long time is going to be wiped
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:23.640]  out unless we do something to save it and it's not going to be easy and uh we're dealing with
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:28.680]  ruthless people utterly ruthless who have all the money and think tanks and propaganda arms in the
[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:36.040]  world to obey them and armies and so on it's at david and goliath but um as i say a true scott to

[02:56:40.680 --> 02:56:45.240]  injections the spraying in the skies that go on every day all that stuff has been done to
[02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:51.480]  his fluoride in the water uh we're dealing with utter psychopathic murderers mass murderers
[02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:55.960]  who believe they're doing it for their own greater good being and we've now hit a jump point
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:57:01.720]  we've now hit a jump point they're clearly accelerating everything now yes they have to
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:06.280]  to ram everything through the whole new system remember what they kept saying in the last century
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:12.040]  that the 21st century is the century of change that was obama's speech as well he's another front
[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:17.160]  man it wouldn't matter who they put in to don't us with his presidency we all know that the front
[02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:21.320]  man they don't change the banking system they don't get right off the debt they don't do any of
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:26.040]  those things they work for the same system and that they're they have to bring this in this
[02:57:26.040 --> 02:57:30.920]  century of change is where we're being taught that we must reduce our numbers they're going to

[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:14.680]  scientific community a large portion of them have lost their moral ethical compass we established
[02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:18.760]  uh people like the they don't even have the hippocratic oath anymore do no harm
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:25.880]  no but what i'm saying is a large portion of the scientific community and i i say that
[02:58:25.880 --> 02:58:33.000]  about the biological the chemical and the technical people have lost their moral ethic
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:40.120]  compass and and standards and we set up a lot of these people to uphold and i'm going to get

[02:59:50.040 --> 02:59:59.160]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:59:59.160 --> 03:00:19.960]  this is such an intense broadcast today so much is happening
[03:00:21.080 --> 03:00:28.360]  alan wad is our guest and what about his statement about how they've removed morals yeah they say
[03:00:28.360 --> 03:00:33.080]  there is no morals beyond good and evil but then they tell you their political correct morals
[03:00:33.080 --> 03:00:38.920]  that make you stand down and never stand up against them that's correct is do what the world is the
[03:00:38.920 --> 03:00:43.320]  whole of the law at the top do whatever you want at the top because you've got all that protection
[03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:49.160]  to to safeguard you you don't end up in court at the top regardless of what you do but for us down
[03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:55.480]  below it also destroyed pretty well all of the culture which binds you together for survival
[03:00:55.480 --> 03:01:01.880]  survival isn't an individual thing it is a collective thing to an extent we all came from
[03:01:01.880 --> 03:01:08.520]  tribes that came through hell and harsh winters and often starvation but we did it as tribes
[03:01:08.520 --> 03:01:14.200]  and that's how you get through things when you break every bond and that was before the attack
[03:01:14.200 --> 03:01:21.400]  was on all bonds internationalism was to break national bonds and tribal bonds and then you
[03:01:21.400 --> 03:01:28.120]  break the bonds of man and wife until really you have nothing left to bond and you have the kids
[03:01:28.120 --> 03:01:32.040]  reporting on their parents let's jam in another call james in ohio you're on the air
[03:01:34.840 --> 03:01:36.920]  okay eric and georgia you're on the air
[03:01:40.440 --> 03:01:45.640]  hello yeah go ahead eric how you doing we're doing all right we're a live broadcast what's on your
[03:01:45.640 --> 03:01:55.320]  mind well first off let me say uh david beek alias by the way um but my question i got two one for
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:02:04.440]  you one for alan alan uh how do we as a people even begin to try to defeat these people because
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:10.840]  they have control of all the major weapons of all the military um how do we even begin
[03:02:10.840 --> 03:02:17.640]  in you begin with yourself you cannot be in their worlds and and try to be rational and
[03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:22.440]  an individual at the same time so you conquer yourself that's the first thing you must get rid
[03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:27.080]  of your own programming and then you perceive things much more clearly then you can put across
[03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:33.800]  to other people of a similar ilk um that that's your ability for self-preservation we're almost
[03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:38.440]  out of time let me just throw this in the pentagon says 90 percent of war is psychological
[03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:43.720]  you unlock your mind to their public blueprints they think so little of you their plans all public
[03:02:43.720 --> 03:02:50.120]  you look at this and and realize this isn't fiction this is real and and and and then once you see it
[03:02:50.120 --> 03:02:54.200]  you unlock people's minds it's over and we don't need to get everybody do we alan
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:03:02.200]  no you don't um again too uh remember what marzi tong said uh he said he wasn't afraid of guns or
[03:03:02.200 --> 03:03:07.240]  weapons or bombs he was afraid of someone with a good idea that's that's what you're scared of
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:13.720]  someone with an idea they can put it across and uh and and it catches on like well no army
[03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:21.880]  can stand against an idea whose time has come yep and it's pure self-preservation now uh we also
[03:03:21.880 --> 03:03:26.520]  have to purify ourselves because we're all contaminated with indoctrination and then the
[03:03:26.520 --> 03:03:30.680]  separation of sex from bonding that's that's what that was one of the prime tenets to the
[03:03:30.680 --> 03:03:35.400]  veteran russell said they'd have to do uh that's what you're lapping up as entertainment you're
[03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:40.920]  being corrupted as you do it and you can't stand together if you have no one to stand with you
[03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:46.120]  god bless you color i appreciate it and i wanted to get to everybody else but we're just out of
[03:03:46.120 --> 03:03:53.240]  time alan watt one minute to give us a summation yes so this is the we're going into the final
[03:03:53.240 --> 03:04:00.760]  part of this uh battle as you say most of it is psychological the war of terror is a psychological
[03:04:00.760 --> 03:04:07.160]  war and the greatest writers on the soviet system and all revolutions will tell you the
[03:04:07.160 --> 03:04:13.000]  totalitarian systems that they don't lose or grip until they become more liberal that's when the
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:17.800]  people start to demand things when the big when the totalitarians become more liberal these guys
[03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:24.120]  are rushing ahead to terrify the hell out of us and we must not be afraid no matter of what they
[03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:29.960]  throw at us and once you become indignant about something that's the start you'll become indignant

[03:07:06.040 --> 03:07:11.240]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[03:07:11.240 --> 03:07:16.120]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[03:07:16.120 --> 03:07:21.800]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[03:07:21.800 --> 03:07:26.760]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[03:07:26.760 --> 03:07:32.200]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always
[03:07:32.200 --> 03:07:36.680]  a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[03:07:36.680 --> 03:07:42.520]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks
[03:07:42.520 --> 03:07:46.280]  i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my

[03:08:00.920 --> 03:08:07.560]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[03:08:10.040 --> 03:08:15.320]  ron avry who heads up architects and engineers for 911 truth here in texas having a big event
[03:08:15.320 --> 03:08:22.440]  coming up saturday we're gonna tell you about that it's happening in all 50 states i was honored
[03:08:22.440 --> 03:08:27.640]  to be invited he's about to be many times down to his silvery or taphouse and i've always
[03:08:27.640 --> 03:08:31.560]  uh declined because i'm so busy but i had to come to this because it's so important
[03:08:32.280 --> 03:08:36.040]  dovetailing well what you're going to hear in the next 52 minutes is this incredible
[03:08:36.040 --> 03:08:43.560]  raw story it's also in the ap now revealed ascroft tenant rumsfeld warned 911 commission
[03:08:44.120 --> 03:08:51.800]  about line it should not cross and they said you will not investigate the attacks themselves
[03:08:51.800 --> 03:08:56.040]  now we already heard a few commissioners say this but it's always a footnote in the media
[03:08:56.040 --> 03:09:05.080]  six of the 10 that's six of the 10 ladies and gentlemen have come out saying it is a
[03:09:05.800 --> 03:09:11.720]  cover-up a farmer the head lawyer a criminal cover-up and then i you know just can't forget
[03:09:12.520 --> 03:09:24.840]  what happened last week on nightline on nightline they came out and showed 911 truth at a meeting
[03:09:24.840 --> 03:09:30.680]  in valley forge at a meeting saying well six of the 10 commissioners question it and they
[03:09:30.680 --> 03:09:39.000]  cut to lee hamilton saying no one questions it now these guys were appointed by bush but at the same
[03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:46.440]  time there's still six of the 10 coming out saying it's a fraud and now we have this internal
[03:09:46.440 --> 03:09:52.920]  white house document on this subject this is so huge ladies and gentlemen it's up on info wars.com
[03:09:52.920 --> 03:09:57.320]  it's up on prisonplanet.com that's why they're so scared of 911 truth because the polls keep
[03:09:57.320 --> 03:10:01.080]  showing more and more people are waking up more and more prominent people are coming out
[03:10:01.080 --> 03:10:05.240]  and the system is scared and i've risked my life before the attacks and on the day of the attacks
[03:10:05.240 --> 03:10:09.160]  telling you it was an inside job this ran corporation peanuts said they wanted something
[03:10:09.160 --> 03:10:15.000]  big and staged i knew the feds had bombed the world trade center the first time in 93 that came out
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:19.960]  in federal documents the audio has been released now of the fbi tapes where their informant knew
[03:10:19.960 --> 03:10:23.960]  they were setting him up he said well you told me to build a new a real bomb now you're seeing go
[03:10:23.960 --> 03:10:27.960]  ahead with this i've got the receipts i've got the proof you told me to do this and they go well
[03:10:27.960 --> 03:10:32.680]  you're not supposed to have those okay i mean it's it's incredible that's in jason bermas's new film
[03:10:33.240 --> 03:10:39.080]  invisible empire new order defined it's like a encyclopedia of new world order history and what
[03:10:39.080 --> 03:10:43.560]  they're doing and their master plan 18 months of the making over a hundred a hundred thousand dollars
[03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:49.880]  to produce it's on presale now ships honor before april 15th on dvd order it and info wars
[03:10:49.880 --> 03:10:55.800]  dot com now we've got the official trailer coming out later this week probably on friday
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:11:02.120]  we've got an earlier trailer from six eight months ago this is the basic this is the first little
[03:11:02.120 --> 03:11:06.840]  sneak peek and i just told bermas like an hour ago i said grab that clip about the scientific
[03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:12.360]  elite technocracy by eisenhower i wanted to play it when watt was on but he's already gone
[03:11:12.360 --> 03:11:18.520]  this is just less than a minute from the two hour 20 minute film the exactly what we were talking
[03:11:18.520 --> 03:11:23.720]  about and eisenhower as he left warned about what was being masked what was being set up
[03:11:23.720 --> 03:11:32.360]  what was being developed so we're now going to go ahead to this one minute clip here it is
[03:11:35.560 --> 03:11:42.520]  crises that will continue to be in meeting them whether foreign or domestic great or small
[03:11:42.520 --> 03:11:49.640]  there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become
[03:11:49.640 --> 03:11:57.640]  the miraculous solution to all current difficulties the prospect of domination of the nation's
[03:11:57.640 --> 03:12:04.920]  scholars by federal employment project allocations and the power of money is ever present and is
[03:12:04.920 --> 03:12:13.720]  gravely to be regarded we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy
[03:12:13.720 --> 03:12:20.040]  could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite
[03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:29.800]  invisible empire a new world order defined this is a powerful film we also have another one coming
[03:12:29.800 --> 03:12:34.440]  out a week later you can pre-order that now police state for the rise of fema now we're
[03:12:34.440 --> 03:12:42.440]  going to get more into this top story of the internal white house mart secret ordering the
[03:12:42.440 --> 03:12:48.680]  commission did not investigate what actually happened on 9 11 a cover up six of the 10 commissioners
[03:12:49.320 --> 03:12:55.240]  but nightline goes on and says we're lying about that you are lying it's been an every major paper
[03:12:55.240 --> 03:13:01.000]  that six of the 10 say it's a criminal cover up they can't even get their own people they've appointed
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:06.120]  to lie they know they murdered our own people there you know the courage it takes for folks to
[03:13:06.120 --> 03:13:14.120]  expose that but we have no future if we don't put ourselves under the gun only by facing up
[03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:19.160]  to these bullies do we have any chance of beating them if you have any self-preservation instincts
[03:13:19.160 --> 03:13:24.520]  any love of god any love of truth you must i'm talking to all you well to do yuppies and people
[03:13:24.520 --> 03:13:28.520]  that think you're part of the system and laugh at anybody that cares you think you're getting ahead
[03:13:28.520 --> 03:13:34.280]  by being narcissistic and never getting involved you think it's cool and cute what's happening
[03:13:34.280 --> 03:13:38.200]  that a lot of businessmen stop me on their harleys or whatever on the side of the street on congress
[03:13:38.200 --> 03:13:43.400]  and go hey you're seeing the black helicopters alex and i'll and i go you really think 9 11
[03:13:43.400 --> 03:13:48.040]  isn't an inside job and they go so what we had to do it that's how things get done you know they
[03:13:48.040 --> 03:13:52.920]  think because they can buy i mean a lot of people in business and and and live think this is cute
[03:13:52.920 --> 03:13:58.920]  they know they think that's how you get america motivated you have all these pentagon documents
[03:13:58.920 --> 03:14:03.800]  where these people need another 9 11 attack that'll get them motivated okay i'm gonna shut up now

[03:15:17.320 --> 03:15:21.640]  we're going to break in about five minutes we'll start getting into your abbreviated uh
[03:15:21.640 --> 03:15:25.880]  breakdown you're going to be doing this with some larger models and things at the event right i'm
[03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:30.440]  also going to this latest news but how did you get into 911 truth tell us about what architecture
[03:15:30.440 --> 03:15:35.720]  engineers has just done the last month and where all this is going okay well i got into it uh
[03:15:35.720 --> 03:15:43.960]  uh essentially right when it happened on 9 11 um 01 uh i was kind of already in the
[03:15:43.960 --> 03:15:49.400]  patriot movement and had uh had opened the taphouse and had patriots there and make special
[03:15:49.400 --> 03:15:56.520]  presentations a lot of people had been predicting that the new world order would create the police
[03:15:56.520 --> 03:16:05.000]  state in america in 2000 and uh so uh actually they were a year late so as soon as i heard about
[03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:11.880]  the world trade center uh having collapsed or one of the towers i knew right then that this was going
[03:16:11.880 --> 03:16:18.440]  to be the event that they were going to bring the new world order in on or the police state in america
[03:16:18.440 --> 03:16:27.320]  so i didn't know all the details how they did it uh or how uh how they collapsed uh but i did know
[03:16:27.320 --> 03:16:34.200]  that it was fishy business right up front absolutely i mean as an architect uh watching
[03:16:34.200 --> 03:16:40.200]  two big towers and seven not hit by a plane small fires collapses at freefall spree nest
[03:16:40.200 --> 03:16:45.080]  had denied that for six years they now admit six years into it two years ago that oh yeah it did
[03:16:45.080 --> 03:16:50.120]  fall at freefall yes at least part of it did and we're going to have a gentleman there at the meeting
[03:16:50.120 --> 03:16:56.200]  uh uh jocelyn derrick jocelyn and he will speak on building seven and the nest report as well
[03:16:57.720 --> 03:17:01.800]  the system's getting really scared of 9 11 truth yes it is and they should be
[03:17:01.800 --> 03:17:09.160]  because it is really their project and they've uh everything in this country now is designed are
[03:17:10.200 --> 03:17:16.120]  promoted by what happened what they claim happened on 9 11 and if they lose that if they lose
[03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:23.240]  cornerstone they lose the whole deal well not just the science of this which is legion but the
[03:17:23.240 --> 03:17:28.760]  history of governments in our own government admittedly staging terror and then within minutes on every
[03:17:28.760 --> 03:17:35.000]  channel the and this is covered in fabled enemies the same talking points the world has changed
[03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:40.840]  you're gonna have to give your rides up we're gonna have to attack iraq within minutes they all
[03:17:40.840 --> 03:17:45.880]  had the same talking point and they had cia operatives as the towers collapsed going oh the
[03:17:45.880 --> 03:17:51.080]  fires did it and as you can see the footprint you can see these operatives on the same channels
[03:17:51.720 --> 03:17:57.240]  bbc did a false start 25 minutes before later was admitted roiders gave it to him i predicted that
[03:17:57.240 --> 03:18:01.560]  i could tell it was a script two channels simultaneously and seeing it in so three
[03:18:01.560 --> 03:18:08.200]  the exact cover story of solemn brother building seven falling exactly how it did before it fell
[03:18:08.200 --> 03:18:13.320]  so just like in in asia and australia new zealand a few hours before they even released the name
[03:18:13.320 --> 03:18:17.640]  they just arrested him of li harvey oswald it was already in the front page of their papers
[03:18:17.640 --> 03:18:23.240]  so they have some screw-ups and again the evidence just goes on and on and on and on but they did
[03:18:23.240 --> 03:18:28.200]  this there's there's no doubt oh i believe it too uh now now i will i will let me let me say
[03:18:28.200 --> 03:18:35.320]  something about that though because this is the way they uh the media targets people like us that
[03:18:35.320 --> 03:18:39.560]  are trying to get to the truth of 9 11 what happened at the world trade center in pentagon
[03:18:40.440 --> 03:18:45.000]  they say well i can't do you actually believe the government had something to do with this
[03:18:46.040 --> 03:18:52.280]  and you know let let me clarify my position on that when i say or when someone says government
[03:18:52.280 --> 03:18:58.120]  to me that means everybody in government that means everybody in the fbi everybody in the
[03:18:58.120 --> 03:19:04.280]  central intelligence agency everybody everywhere and i don't believe that i in fact i don't believe
[03:19:04.280 --> 03:19:08.840]  the fbi had anything to do with 9 11 in fact they killed the former anti-terror had no i agree with
[03:19:08.840 --> 03:19:13.400]  you it's criminal rogue networks but here's what i'd like to say and this is this is what none of
[03:19:13.400 --> 03:19:19.480]  them have been able to come back it uh on me with is that i believe we have a foreign military
[03:19:19.480 --> 03:19:24.280]  operating in our country and doing these things and pulling these things off and we have some
[03:19:24.280 --> 03:19:30.760]  high political uh operatives that are protecting these people so they can operate in this country
[03:19:30.760 --> 03:19:37.880]  and if you're an american you ought to be concerned about a foreign alien army military operating in
[03:19:37.880 --> 03:19:43.000]  our country we need to undiscover these people and get them out of here and i would guess you're
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:48.680]  talking about israeli involvement i sure am all right well you can go there and we'll also talk

[03:25:37.320 --> 03:25:41.000]  we're going to talk about some of that generally but let's get into the subject uh that you brought
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:46.920]  up i don't get into this a lot because it's so complex and it can be used either way and the
[03:25:46.920 --> 03:25:51.240]  establishment from day one always like to say look at these 11 truthers are saying israel did it
[03:25:51.240 --> 03:25:55.640]  when you look at england israel the united states the anglo-american establishment as it's called
[03:25:55.640 --> 03:25:59.960]  i think it with anglo people that's just what the globalists call it these intelligence agencies
[03:25:59.960 --> 03:26:04.600]  are all merged and it's what tarply and i agree with him his book synthetic terror it's groups from
[03:26:04.600 --> 03:26:10.680]  all of these organizations it's like al-qaeda got saudi arabian funding pakistani israeli
[03:26:10.680 --> 03:26:16.360]  us and british it's always the same actors but i do agree that they find a strong brigade
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:21.080]  for all i mean it's been in the haritz and jr. post that israel has fake al-qaeda groups
[03:26:21.960 --> 03:26:29.480]  i wouldn't doubt that uh i you're into a lot more that than i am i all i know is i'm a christian
[03:26:29.480 --> 03:26:36.840]  and i know what the western civilization should have been and and it is not based on israel and
[03:26:36.840 --> 03:26:42.920]  judaism they always say uh the judaeo christian way well that's like saying the night and day way
[03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:50.760]  uh christianity yes came from judaism but it is not judaism and the two really don't mix well
[03:26:50.760 --> 03:26:56.280]  isn't it more complex than that christianity comes from the ancient judaism of mount sinai
[03:26:56.280 --> 03:27:01.400]  not uh the jews going into captivity in different parts of the world and adopting the babeloni
[03:27:01.400 --> 03:27:07.880]  and talmud uh and there i don't go there either there's a lot of talk about this and that uh who
[03:27:07.880 --> 03:27:15.320]  the real jews are who the the fake jews are my perspective is the jew is one who accepts christ
[03:27:15.320 --> 03:27:21.640]  as king of kings lord of lords and savior of the cosmos and everything in it now uh those that reject
[03:27:21.640 --> 03:27:28.120]  him uh become by nature the antichrist those that do not believe that the savior of all mankind
[03:27:28.120 --> 03:27:34.040]  has come in the flesh of jesus christ now i don't really even want to go much more there okay but
[03:27:34.040 --> 03:27:38.920]  you brought it up and and we don't censor people okay and and and and so you're here and you brought

[03:34:11.800 --> 03:34:17.080]  point in time they decided to lie and not tell the people the truth he called it a criminal
[03:34:17.080 --> 03:34:23.480]  conspiracy by the pentagon yeah well i mean i i don't doubt it there's absolutely upper level
[03:34:24.040 --> 03:34:29.400]  people that are covering up what really happened and now when i say that again that doesn't mean
[03:34:29.400 --> 03:34:33.320]  the government as they always like to say criminal elements in multiple intelligence
[03:34:33.320 --> 03:34:39.960]  agencies that stood to gain from new wars and control correct absolutely okay um
[03:34:41.720 --> 03:34:46.040]  you've got the floor now i mean get into whatever you want let's get into your for prison planet
[03:34:46.040 --> 03:34:52.200]  dot tv viewers you've got a basic breakdown of a mini version of what you'll actually be doing at
[03:34:52.200 --> 03:34:59.720]  the event uh coming up from uh one uh two nine on saturday the double tree again everybody call
[03:34:59.720 --> 03:35:06.840]  the media newspapers tv radio tell them be there and cover it send them youtube clips of international
[03:35:06.840 --> 03:35:13.640]  news been covering it this is news go ahead sir yes well uh i brought my little easel here and uh
[03:35:13.640 --> 03:35:18.840]  i am an architect and one of the things that kind of puzzles me these days is all these fancy
[03:35:19.880 --> 03:35:29.400]  automatic computer generated uh they even have them animated where they show the plane crashing
[03:35:29.400 --> 03:35:34.680]  into the building and they can really do anything with these computers i just did this on plain old
[03:35:34.680 --> 03:35:40.520]  paper with plain old markers to show you how architects really think now um what this is
[03:35:40.520 --> 03:35:50.040]  really showing here the south tower uh of 110 stories uh it leans 22 degrees uh to the west
[03:35:50.040 --> 03:35:58.520]  over building four and it was which is right down here so uh what you have uh in in reality when
[03:35:58.520 --> 03:36:03.960]  that happened it would be something like the pensoil building in houston falling off of an 80
[03:36:03.960 --> 03:36:11.160]  story building uh and when i first saw that in reality it it just it shocked me it just that's
[03:36:11.160 --> 03:36:17.560]  roughly 30 stories that fell on a how many story was well it it actually didn't fall that's why i'm
[03:36:17.560 --> 03:36:23.400]  showing this little diagram here there's something major wrong here because what we have uh when we
[03:36:23.400 --> 03:36:30.040]  have this spot right here the way you figure out how to stop a rotation like this once it starts
[03:36:30.040 --> 03:36:36.760]  is uh you take the full height of the part that's rotating which is 384 feet and you divide it in
[03:36:36.760 --> 03:36:42.440]  half which is 192 feet and then you multiply it by the weight of the portion that's falling off
[03:36:43.240 --> 03:36:53.080]  which is 290 000 kips which is 290 000 or 2 290 million pounds is what this weighs
[03:36:53.080 --> 03:36:59.640]  and it it starts to rotate about this point right here which is 192 feet away you end up with a
[03:36:59.640 --> 03:37:08.520]  force moment of 55 million 680 000 foot kips now that's also required to stop that rotation you see
[03:37:09.480 --> 03:37:15.320]  so where did that come from it didn't come from anywhere what should have happened instead of
[03:37:15.320 --> 03:37:19.400]  this happening at the end of it you should have had this right here
[03:37:22.760 --> 03:37:28.520]  this thing this top portion of the building should have fallen to the ground in one chunk
[03:37:28.520 --> 03:37:35.080]  because it was if the only reason the only way it could have not fallen like that is for it to be
[03:37:35.080 --> 03:37:42.280]  demolished from the inside all the way up and it was all blown into powdered dust sure so that the
[03:37:42.280 --> 03:37:48.360]  piece couldn't fall because it it it also had the demolition charges all set all the way because
[03:37:48.360 --> 03:37:53.400]  there's no way i mean if a 30-story chunk of a building breaks off it's it's going to fall almost
[03:37:53.400 --> 03:37:59.000]  intact absolutely and be down on the ground but no it doesn't it just vaporizes that's right and
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:04.680]  we're we're expected to believe and this is this is basic architecture and engineering right here
[03:38:04.680 --> 03:38:11.880]  i mean that's as basic as it gets and we're expected to just uh ignore that let's just ignore
[03:38:11.880 --> 03:38:19.080]  the idea that that this this uh this can happen okay the next theory that they propose is the
[03:38:19.080 --> 03:38:26.360]  pancaking theory now we got a real problem with this because uh even if you just uh multiplied
[03:38:26.360 --> 03:38:34.920]  the five inches of concrete on the steel deck uh you get uh about four four stories high of nothing
[03:38:34.920 --> 03:38:40.760]  but concrete slab well now the problem there is you've overlooked the steel that's been crushed
[03:38:40.760 --> 03:38:45.640]  in between it so if you crush all the steel in between it you've got about another three feet
[03:38:45.640 --> 03:38:52.840]  of steel uh in between each one so what we're if it was truly a pancake what you would have here
[03:38:52.840 --> 03:39:02.520]  is a 27 stories of crushed concrete and steel in between it well that's taller than the hotel
[03:39:02.520 --> 03:39:08.200]  that was right next to it the the marriott hotel right next to there was no pancake it was aerosolized
[03:39:08.200 --> 03:39:13.000]  the concrete was turned and they said body parts were no better than an inch long correct and the
[03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:17.000]  only way you can do that is through explosive charges that's the only way that can happen you
[03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:23.160]  can even see the blast squibs coming out yeah you sure can and and oh oh when you first see it you're
[03:39:23.160 --> 03:39:28.760]  just so astonished with everything you don't really it it's taken really nine years to really
[03:39:28.760 --> 03:39:34.360]  analyze and understand this it shouldn't have because our government really did not analyze it
[03:39:34.360 --> 03:39:42.360]  it's been up to the people ordinary citizens to actually investigate uh this crime okay the next
[03:39:42.360 --> 03:39:47.640]  thing we get into most people don't know that we have a hat trust on the top of this uh tower
[03:39:47.640 --> 03:39:53.000]  and guys zoom in some on this while he's doing it go ahead yes this this this is a hat trust right
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:58.120]  here uh they call it that it's a five-story trust system that sat on top of the building
[03:39:58.680 --> 03:40:05.240]  and it uh spans from the core uh and this is a core showing right here about how big it is
[03:40:05.240 --> 03:40:11.400]  and they first told us it was a hollow tube uh which is incorrect totally and some people even call
[03:40:11.400 --> 03:40:16.760]  it a tube within a tube but the reality of it is it's even stronger than that it's actually a building
[03:40:16.760 --> 03:40:23.080]  inside of we have the former architect and the former builder manager on record before it got
[03:40:23.080 --> 03:40:28.920]  hit saying it was over designed to take two big jets well even multiple i remember the architect
[03:40:28.920 --> 03:40:36.520]  on the actually said that it was multiple impacts of a 707 which is very comparable to the 767
[03:40:36.520 --> 03:40:42.520]  and it was a four engine moved faster but carried the same and it had a super core but the media
[03:40:42.520 --> 03:40:47.000]  just said there was nothing that's right only casper the friendly ghost was in there that's
[03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:54.120]  holding it up now uh so uh what this hat trust does though if you think about it it spans uh
[03:40:54.120 --> 03:41:01.240]  65 feet in one direction in this longer direction on each side and 35 feet on the shorter direction
[03:41:01.240 --> 03:41:08.440]  on this side and everybody's familiar with train bridges you know those things you drive these big
[03:41:08.440 --> 03:41:15.000]  old train cars with trestles train trestles that's what we're talking about and this one's five
[03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:20.760]  stories tall uh there's one out in McQueenie right next to my tap room that's three stories tall
[03:41:20.760 --> 03:41:28.120]  maybe two and a half stories tall and it carries uh and it spans like probably 200 feet uh or maybe
[03:41:28.120 --> 03:41:36.040]  more 250 feet and it's only two and a half stories and whereas this this one here uh spans only uh
[03:41:36.040 --> 03:41:43.080]  65 and 35 feet and is five stories tall and what i'm driving at is you could drive a train and park
[03:41:43.080 --> 03:41:50.200]  a train loaded in other words this thing can carry a lot of weight uh and and and the north tower
[03:41:50.200 --> 03:41:57.240]  when it was hit it's only eight stories from the top that means that even if even if these uh
[03:41:57.240 --> 03:42:04.440]  uh the vertical even if the vertical columns were not uh were not connected to each other
[03:42:05.080 --> 03:42:13.080]  they would be held up by the hat trust on the north tower so uh and these all the exterior
[03:42:13.080 --> 03:42:20.120]  columns were 100 000 psi steel uh the strongest you can get it's heat treated uh and they were
[03:42:20.120 --> 03:42:27.720]  14 inches by 14 inches square and they actually form what is called a verendal truss and one of
[03:42:27.720 --> 03:42:35.000]  the uh the architects that was uh working uh in association with the main architect on this uh
[03:42:35.000 --> 03:42:42.280]  project uh said that it was just like a 209 foot deep beam is what we're looking at on the sides
[03:42:42.280 --> 03:42:48.520]  of this building so uh we'll move to the next one and we're gonna what i want to do is get
[03:42:48.520 --> 03:42:54.280]  everybody comfortable with the way that this building is really designed so just proportionately
[03:42:54.280 --> 03:43:01.800]  you can draw seven by seven square it's two squares on the one side two squares on the other and
[03:43:01.800 --> 03:43:07.480]  three in the middle you got four on one side on the other side and one and a half on each end
[03:43:08.120 --> 03:43:13.160]  so now you can sketch this in your sleep if you wanted to and know exactly what the building
[03:43:13.160 --> 03:43:17.800]  core was like but the media line said that didn't exist that's right said it's not there and it was
[03:43:17.800 --> 03:43:24.360]  all all run by trusses lightweight metal trusses that went all the way that wouldn't even have held
[03:43:24.360 --> 03:43:28.040]  the building up it's just an assilant an asinine line when the plans for the building have been
[03:43:28.040 --> 03:43:34.520]  public for decades that's right so and in this part the middle core is heavy steel uh and with
[03:43:34.520 --> 03:43:41.320]  heavy girders there and uh uh then there there's trusses on that but they are connected to heavy
[03:43:41.320 --> 03:43:47.480]  girders going both ways uh connected to heavy steel columns now down here in this portion
[03:43:47.480 --> 03:43:53.000]  that does have lightweight steel trusses but they are also doubled they're three foot deep
[03:43:53.000 --> 03:43:59.880]  and they're doubled and they go both ways which means a space frame and uh actually when this
[03:43:59.880 --> 03:44:05.640]  building was being designed the articles and literature on it actually called it a space frame
[03:44:05.640 --> 03:44:11.000]  a space frame floor and that's what they had so in order to have and we're going to get to that
[03:44:11.000 --> 03:44:21.720]  right here what it looks like uh right here uh these trusses are going both ways this line
[03:44:21.720 --> 03:44:26.840]  right here shows the truss heading that way and these are trusses heading this way now there is
[03:44:26.840 --> 03:44:34.840]  a truss double truss that connects uh every column on the exterior back to the core and there are
[03:44:34.840 --> 03:44:44.200]  trusses at every junk uh every uh low part of the web right here uh uh that that goes the other way
[03:44:44.200 --> 03:44:51.000]  so in fact if you look at this we take a section right here at section c now this is these trusses
[03:44:51.000 --> 03:44:57.000]  are running out to the exterior wall here's the exterior steel here's the interior heavy steel
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:45:05.960]  the this car gated metal decking is running towards the exterior so it doesn't roll up if you hit it
[03:45:06.520 --> 03:45:12.520]  it acts as a knife blade because it won't buckle up it won't roll up because it is the trusses
[03:45:12.520 --> 03:45:17.640]  are actually the tops of the trusses are poured into the concrete there the concrete is poured
[03:45:17.640 --> 03:45:22.920]  around the tops of the trusses so this this is built like a brick you know what oh you you got it
[03:45:22.920 --> 03:45:27.880]  now you're now we're getting the idea of what this thing's like and here's the exterior this is
[03:45:27.880 --> 03:45:34.920]  like a i call it a cheese grater um you've got a and here's the exterior wall what it looks like
[03:45:34.920 --> 03:45:40.200]  these things are one are three foot three center to center and that's why the planes evaporated
[03:45:40.200 --> 03:45:45.880]  but two magic passports not one but two drifted down unheard and were found that day by the
[03:45:45.880 --> 03:45:51.240]  government yeah in one piece oh but but let me but it flew into an armored cheese grater that's
[03:45:51.240 --> 03:45:57.560]  exactly right and so here's the size of the jet the fuselage of the jet is the inner red circle
[03:45:57.560 --> 03:46:04.280]  the orange circle on the inside is the size of the jet engine and you can see what trouble it did
[03:46:04.280 --> 03:46:10.600]  when it hit this thing it is just like a cheese grater now going 530 miles an hour you got to
[03:46:10.600 --> 03:46:16.280]  remember that if it was at landing speed it probably would not have pierced the outer wall
[03:46:16.280 --> 03:46:21.240]  and they knew that see now that we know that nano thermite has been used on this building now we
[03:46:21.240 --> 03:46:27.080]  know that they planned every piece of it they planned the speed of the jet they planned everything
[03:46:27.080 --> 03:46:32.840]  about it because if they had to run it slower uh uh what again at the building to mount scoff
[03:46:32.840 --> 03:46:40.280]  correct and they didn't want that uh and now we know too that that's why the building too uh fell
[03:46:40.280 --> 03:46:45.560]  first uh south tower fell first is because the fireman had reached the 78th floor they were
[03:46:45.560 --> 03:46:50.120]  going to put it out they right radio bag they were saying uh the fires aren't even here this is no
[03:46:50.120 --> 03:46:55.560]  big people were standing next to columns waving so it wasn't melting their bodies or even hurting
[03:46:55.560 --> 03:47:00.520]  them but giant columns suddenly melted and blew up the fires had dissipated heat had gone down
[03:47:01.320 --> 03:47:05.800]  but you got to get rid of those firefighters they're about to find the evidence well yeah and and
[03:47:05.800 --> 03:47:10.920]  if the whole whole object we now know was to get rid of the buildings in the first place
[03:47:10.920 --> 03:47:16.360]  because they had to remove all this asbestos uh let me ask you this we may have to go into overdrive
[03:47:16.360 --> 03:47:21.400]  which will this then just be on prison planet dot tv okay info wars dot com how long is this
[03:47:21.400 --> 03:47:25.720]  going to take i may have to skip this break too that's fine um i don't it's not good for our
[03:47:25.720 --> 03:47:30.520]  affiliates let me let me see we've let's let's only do this one more sheet no no do you have to go
[03:47:30.520 --> 03:47:35.560]  somewhere i don't gentlemen can we do 20 minutes of overdrive this is this is i'm gonna go ahead
[03:47:35.560 --> 03:47:39.960]  and take the break because we're on xm and a bunch of m and fm's coming up and then we'll have five
[03:47:39.960 --> 03:47:44.600]  more minutes at the stations here and what i'll do is in a few weeks i'll even re-air this in
[03:47:44.600 --> 03:47:49.320]  another hour so the stations all get to air it but people will have to go to prison planet dot tv
[03:47:49.320 --> 03:47:55.800]  or info wars dot com only on those audio streams and video streams to get the rest of this so i
[03:47:55.800 --> 03:48:01.400]  want you to take your time continue okay well this is this now i'm really beginning to get
[03:48:01.400 --> 03:48:07.480]  into exactly how this these buildings function as as i've talked about before is there we have
[03:48:07.480 --> 03:48:14.600]  this five-story hat trust on the top that can work in tension but actually the more i study
[03:48:14.600 --> 03:48:21.240]  this building we don't even need the tension we don't need the tension carrying hat trust because
[03:48:22.200 --> 03:48:30.920]  right here is how this is summarized we know that in here that because it's a space frame floor
[03:48:30.920 --> 03:48:37.240]  with trusses running in both directions that it cannot collapse it cannot collapse all the way
[03:48:37.240 --> 03:48:43.000]  across the floor just because you've damaged a portion of it it has to these these are still
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:48.680]  connected to the outer columns on the north tower these columns were not severed they go all the way
[03:48:48.680 --> 03:48:55.720]  up to the top now these this pink line reddish pink line are spandrel panels that are 54 inches deep
[03:48:55.720 --> 03:49:03.560]  of two inch steel that is welded to every column now all of this is still in place is still holding
[03:49:03.560 --> 03:49:09.720]  columns it's still holding floors and the reason why that these are now acting as long span beams
[03:49:09.720 --> 03:49:19.560]  over to both columns which has about probably uh 15 columns on each side of this so all of this
[03:49:19.560 --> 03:49:25.000]  what is happening is all of this damage is getting compartmentalized it's not spreading
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:31.800]  anywhere even the even the collapsing floors this building is just not designed the designer said
[03:49:31.800 --> 03:49:37.320]  it's made of a plane hits it it's it's it's like a mosquito going into a net it it doesn't just
[03:49:37.320 --> 03:49:43.560]  catches it well let me even it's even it's worse than that and i've heard people say it's like
[03:49:43.560 --> 03:49:49.720]  poking a pencil through a screen wrong analogy all together because a screen we all know a door
[03:49:49.720 --> 03:49:56.600]  screen is not structural and it is uh and the structure of a screen is the frame of the door
[03:49:56.600 --> 03:50:03.160]  and you you can you put your hand through it if you drive it hard enough but that's not what this
[03:50:03.160 --> 03:50:11.720]  building is this is more like a great it's like a very powerful steel great and whatever hits that
[03:50:11.720 --> 03:50:17.400]  thing is going to be shredded it's going to be well then you get their lies about the the the
[03:50:17.400 --> 03:50:22.120]  fires melting steel or even weakening it everybody knows that your barbecue pit it doesn't weaken
[03:50:22.120 --> 03:50:27.880]  or melt i mean and those are fires hot what 500 600 1000 degrees hotter i mean this was a
[03:50:27.880 --> 03:50:33.720]  pathetically low level fire most the fuel was dissipated and the big plume on impact

[03:54:57.720 --> 03:55:05.240]  that will go back over what you rushed over in the next 20 go ahead okay the synopsis is that the
[03:55:05.240 --> 03:55:14.040]  the the world trade center towers were designed to withstand multiple impacts of 707s and as i've
[03:55:14.040 --> 03:55:24.280]  been studying this building that the twin towers i have noticed things that are are not traditional
[03:55:24.280 --> 03:55:31.800]  in terms of how the floors and things will like that were designed uh and now i realize why they
[03:55:31.800 --> 03:55:39.720]  were designed that way because it was to deal with unforeseen events like crashing airplane
[03:55:39.720 --> 03:55:45.160]  new york the new york the empire states building others have been hit by by aircraft yes and uh
[03:55:46.440 --> 03:55:51.480]  come on they act like these architects weren't thinking that anytime that you build something
[03:55:51.480 --> 03:55:57.880]  that's 1368 feet high you have to consider uh airplane accident biggest building in the world
[03:55:57.880 --> 03:56:03.080]  at the time and we have the architect who is japanese and the project director both on record
[03:56:03.080 --> 03:56:07.960]  before it happened bragging about how it could take all these strikes correct uh and of course
[03:56:07.960 --> 03:56:14.280]  this has all been written back in the 1970s uh when they were proposing and building the building
[03:56:14.280 --> 03:56:19.560]  that all these things were taken into account and i'd like to even mention that the exterior
[03:56:19.560 --> 03:56:28.280]  columns of this high uh high strength steel uh they say can take a 2000 percent of the gravity
[03:56:28.280 --> 03:56:35.560]  load that it was designed to do it can take an additional live load of 2000 percent that's an
[03:56:35.560 --> 03:56:43.320]  amazing calculation and that's why these columns are quite able to hold anything that is now been
[03:56:43.320 --> 03:56:49.400]  put into tension by severing the columns below it because it can handle 2000 percent of its way
[03:56:49.400 --> 03:56:55.400]  correct unbelievably overbuilt correct that is correct in fact i've read about other new tall
[03:56:55.400 --> 03:56:58.680]  buildings they don't even build them this good that this was the first time they're building
[03:56:58.680 --> 03:57:02.600]  mega building like this so they were really careful i think something else is very strange
[03:57:02.600 --> 03:57:08.680]  about this when i read the uh executive summary of the fema report on this building they don't call
[03:57:08.680 --> 03:57:15.800]  for any uh uh and first of all the most amazing thing they say is after the planes hit uh uh
[03:57:15.800 --> 03:57:21.720]  they're not really sure what caused what was the major event after the collisions and after the fires
[03:57:21.720 --> 03:57:27.800]  were burning down what the what the event was uh that that would they even mentioned there was no
[03:57:27.800 --> 03:57:32.840]  earthquake there was no uh windstorm and that's what they were looking for they were looking for
[03:57:32.840 --> 03:57:37.800]  in a major event and then at the kind of the end of the paragraph they kind of went out and said
[03:57:37.800 --> 03:57:45.240]  well the major event were these fires uh that that uh eventually caused some collapsing floors uh that
[03:57:45.240 --> 03:57:53.320]  initiated they've since reversed the pancake theory well uh i here's to to my understanding what
[03:57:53.320 --> 03:58:00.200]  happened was that after the ul laboratories did their report uh and they found that uh they actually
[03:58:00.200 --> 03:58:05.480]  built a bay of this stuff and then subjected it to the same degrees of fire and the result was
[03:58:05.480 --> 03:58:11.480]  there was there was some sagging yes but there was no uh there was no trusses that were coming off
[03:58:11.480 --> 03:58:16.280]  the wall and you're certainly not going to have an explosive ending to the building pyrotechnic
[03:58:16.280 --> 03:58:21.560]  shooting dust five miles and shooting girder 600 feet we're going to have to end the main broadcast
[03:58:21.560 --> 03:58:29.000]  now we'll be back after one minute for overdrive only at prisonplanet.tv and the free internet
[03:58:29.000 --> 03:58:35.800]  audio streams at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com you'll see mr abry and myself and many others this

[03:59:03.800 --> 03:59:09.880]  americans at home and have tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really
[03:59:09.880 --> 03:59:16.280]  are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[03:59:16.280 --> 03:59:22.360]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent

[03:59:31.960 --> 03:59:37.720]  the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen
[03:59:38.360 --> 03:59:45.560]  a fall of the republic yet your copy of full of the republic on dvd at info wars.com we're watching
[03:59:45.560 --> 03:59:54.920]  online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv coast to coast direct from austin
[03:59:54.920 --> 03:59:59.800]  you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[04:00:15.800 --> 04:00:20.840]  well i haven't done overdrive in probably six months we're live monday through friday 11 a.m to
[04:00:20.840 --> 04:00:28.040]  three p.m at info wars.com we have ron avry heads up texas architects and engineers 911 truth
[04:00:28.040 --> 04:00:33.480]  in all 50 states they're having events press conferences and events with architects and
[04:00:33.480 --> 04:00:39.400]  engineers there are 1100 and growing members and texas one of the biggest and most popular states
[04:00:40.120 --> 04:00:45.000]  is going to have a huge event with a whole bunch of speakers when we end this special 20 minute
[04:00:45.000 --> 04:00:49.320]  overdrive i'm going to go over the press release and who's going to be there but we need your help
[04:00:49.320 --> 04:00:53.320]  viewers to call everybody you know and tell them to be there it's free but they ask for a six dollar
[04:00:53.320 --> 04:00:58.120]  donation because if each person pays six dollars that comes they've estimated that'll pay for the
[04:00:58.120 --> 04:01:04.040]  ballroom at a nice hotel double tree north is 35 now you had to abbreviate your presentation
[04:01:05.960 --> 04:01:10.920]  at the end kind of abbreviate the beginning now to recap and then take your time on the other
[04:01:10.920 --> 04:01:15.480]  panels of this you're going to have a bigger model and a lot more there at the event we're
[04:01:15.480 --> 04:01:23.000]  going to really detail this so mr avry please continue okay to start out i'm glad you mentioned
[04:01:23.000 --> 04:01:28.440]  that we will have a model of the entire world trade center that's at one inch equals 30 feet
[04:01:28.440 --> 04:01:33.400]  so it's about four foot by four foot and about five and a half feet tall so it's it's something to
[04:01:33.400 --> 04:01:40.440]  look at and you can come up and take photographs of it if you'd like at at some point during the
[04:01:40.440 --> 04:01:49.400]  event but to summarize i guess in the beginning first of all i will not present anything on
[04:01:49.400 --> 04:01:54.440]  building seven we'll have another gentleman that talks about building seven and the nest report
[04:01:54.440 --> 04:02:03.640]  i will concentrate only on the twin towers and so what i've discovered by studying the twin towers
[04:02:03.640 --> 04:02:11.320]  and the structure is that it was a very powerful building and quite able to handle the impact
[04:02:12.040 --> 04:02:18.520]  of a 767 and the reason why that is is because every portion of this building
[04:02:18.520 --> 04:02:26.120]  it was built in such a way that when they say pancake this building just does not lend itself
[04:02:26.120 --> 04:02:32.280]  to pancaking anything that happens to it is compartmentalized by the way it's structured
[04:02:32.280 --> 04:02:37.880]  if it could fall over it would topple correct if it was good if it was going to and in fact it
[04:02:37.880 --> 04:02:45.640]  actually happened now and that's this this very first drawing here and and uh i've got to give
[04:02:45.640 --> 04:02:51.880]  some credit to eric huff schmitt you probably know him he he did a video a two hour video
[04:02:51.880 --> 04:02:58.280]  way back when on painful questions and he has a very nice book too that he did and when i first
[04:02:58.280 --> 04:03:07.000]  saw this too i was not aware of this happening but what the the toppling of the uh are the
[04:03:07.000 --> 04:03:16.360]  leaning over the top of the north south tower uh creates a force moment and and the way you figure
[04:03:16.360 --> 04:03:24.280]  this out in structures is to you divide the the total height of the part that's rotating in rotation
[04:03:24.280 --> 04:03:30.920]  and uh you divide it in two to come up with the center of its gravity and then you multiply
[04:03:30.920 --> 04:03:39.400]  it by the weight of the whole structure that's in rotation and we know that that's 290 000 kips
[04:03:39.400 --> 04:03:46.680]  290 million pounds and you multiply it by 192 feet the half of its height and you get a force
[04:03:46.680 --> 04:03:55.080]  moment of 55 680 000 foot kips now that is a very powerful event going on right here
[04:03:55.080 --> 04:04:01.960]  it's like pencil oil tower falling off of an 80 story building uh this so what you need to stop
[04:04:01.960 --> 04:04:10.120]  this rotation is exactly the same thing on the other side you have to you have to uh push against
[04:04:10.120 --> 04:04:19.960]  the the the leaning side uh with 55 680 000 foot kips is what would be required and it would have
[04:04:19.960 --> 04:04:24.360]  stayed together basically in one big piece and fallen to the ground but it didn't get broke off
[04:04:24.360 --> 04:04:30.760]  and then evaporated absolutely and this is why i have a big question mark here how did how could
[04:04:30.760 --> 04:04:39.880]  this start and end up with this a molten metal tons of molten metal in the basement and just 25
[04:04:39.880 --> 04:04:46.120]  hundred degrees six weeks later satellite aircraft photos the government reports submitted all this
[04:04:46.120 --> 04:04:51.560]  molten steel way above any temperature the jet fuel could cause absolutely absolutely we've got
[04:04:51.560 --> 04:04:57.640]  the firefighter saying it was like a uh inside a foundry just molten metal spilling everywhere
[04:04:57.640 --> 04:05:03.640]  correct and we find out that the molten iron in the basements is not really that that's not from
[04:05:03.640 --> 04:05:09.400]  steel i always thought that maybe that was the melted steel it's not it's actually the end of
[04:05:09.400 --> 04:05:16.600]  a thermite reaction because it turns steel into molten iron correct correct it was the byproduct
[04:05:16.600 --> 04:05:24.280]  of smelting i guess the reverse smelting breaking steel that was produced with the coke uh down into
[04:05:24.280 --> 04:05:32.120]  like pig iron is that right uh when i talk to uh to some other gentlemen at architects and engineers
[04:05:32.120 --> 04:05:40.040]  for 911 truth they're telling me that it is not from just uh you know there's iron makes up a part
[04:05:40.040 --> 04:05:46.200]  of steel obviously but that's not where that iron comes from it comes from actual the thermite
[04:05:46.200 --> 04:05:51.240]  reaction itself and they with the spectrometers jones and others and separately people duplicated
[04:05:51.240 --> 04:05:58.680]  this you get the samples it has the exact uh byproducts the leavings of the explosive thermite
[04:05:58.680 --> 04:06:04.680]  correct correct and of course we have discovered the the unspent thermite in this stuff well anyway
[04:06:04.680 --> 04:06:12.120]  this next uh uh uh chart here shows what should have happened i mean this is exactly what should
[04:06:12.120 --> 04:06:19.960]  have happened this top part should have fallen off in one uh one chunk 32 stories tall with
[04:06:19.960 --> 04:06:25.160]  structural integrity inside of it right here but this didn't happen and the reason why it didn't
[04:06:25.160 --> 04:06:33.240]  happen obviously is it had been exploded from the top up and from the uh all the way up and down the
[04:06:33.240 --> 04:06:40.200]  building now this is what we're asked to believe and you don't need any fancy mathematics to prove
[04:06:40.200 --> 04:06:49.560]  this just the the five inches of concrete floors multiplied by 110 is going to give you a three
[04:06:49.560 --> 04:06:59.480]  almost four foot high i mean four story high a stack of concrete pancakes now since it did have
[04:06:59.480 --> 04:07:04.520]  six stories under the ground right here that would that would take care of that but we're
[04:07:04.520 --> 04:07:09.800]  forgetting the steel steel like that just doesn't fold up into anything there's steel in between
[04:07:09.800 --> 04:07:17.160]  each one of these floors so you've got to at least permit at least three feet of gnarled twisted
[04:07:17.160 --> 04:07:22.200]  steel in between each one of these uh concrete slabs the result is you're going to end up with
[04:07:22.200 --> 04:07:29.000]  about a 27 story pile of pancake slabs and twisted steel but instead it was like a what a one story
[04:07:29.000 --> 04:07:36.360]  pile oh two two maybe two stories above the basement so of course there was lots of uh
[04:07:36.360 --> 04:07:42.840]  debris in the basement level so uh you you're talking about uh you know eight stories but
[04:07:42.840 --> 04:07:50.200]  but you don't see any slabs there's no slabs at all the concrete is gone and and we know where it
[04:07:50.200 --> 04:07:56.440]  went it went all over manhattan uh southern manhattan was covered with and then the epa lied and said
[04:07:56.440 --> 04:08:03.480]  that the mercury from all the equipment and the computers and the mercury fired thermostats
[04:08:03.480 --> 04:08:09.480]  and the asbestos and the concrete was good for the firefighters and the media msnbc has called
[04:08:09.480 --> 04:08:14.840]  them conspiracy theorists scum that they're even saying they're dying when all the universities
[04:08:14.840 --> 04:08:19.720]  and medical facilities have spent literally hundreds of articles they do cat scans and some
[04:08:19.720 --> 04:08:25.320]  of them have multiple ounces of the glass and stuff in their lungs they're dying they're not
[04:08:25.320 --> 04:08:29.880]  faking going in the ground i believe they've got nanothermite in their lungs i don't know why
[04:08:29.880 --> 04:08:33.720]  they couldn't have been breathing all that stuff too it was in every dust sample taken and that's
[04:08:33.720 --> 04:08:40.520]  what we found so anyway uh the next uh this is showing the full height of the building
[04:08:40.520 --> 04:08:46.360]  uh and uh the mechanical floors that were uh spaced in between this is how it's overbuilt to
[04:08:46.360 --> 04:08:53.560]  two thousand time stress that's that's right and then we have uh uh then we have they also use
[04:08:53.560 --> 04:08:58.920]  trusses in these zones to connect the exterior to the core the size of a giant railroad trestle
[04:08:58.920 --> 04:09:04.360]  that's right it keeps the building from leaning too much and and from swaying the wind right
[04:09:04.360 --> 04:09:09.720]  that's right and uh so this is showing the core at the top is supporting the five-story
[04:09:09.720 --> 04:09:16.280]  hat trust and uh and of course you you know about train trestles the kind of things they'll
[04:09:16.280 --> 04:09:21.400]  they they can carry the kind of weight you can park a train on them and there's one over by
[04:09:21.400 --> 04:09:27.640]  the taphouse it's about 250 feet long and they park trains on them loaded with gravel and everything
[04:09:27.640 --> 04:09:35.320]  else and this one's five stories and only spans 65 feet and 35 feet and could certainly support
[04:09:35.320 --> 04:09:43.000]  anything near the top for sure uh with uh uh merely by transferring the tension at the top
[04:09:43.880 --> 04:09:50.040]  onto the heavy steel core in the middle so the plane couldn't have sliced it off like it did
[04:09:50.040 --> 04:09:55.480]  yeah well what i was worried about is if you cut all these columns on the outside or a lot of them
[04:09:55.480 --> 04:10:01.000]  would you have global collapse well the fact is no you wouldn't in fact if you're this close to the
[04:10:01.000 --> 04:10:07.720]  top you could probably cut every column all the way around and the hat trust would transfer all
[04:10:07.720 --> 04:10:15.000]  of the tension in those columns over to the central core and when on the north tower as we get over
[04:10:15.000 --> 04:10:21.080]  here you see it's even but again according to the media the documents mega central core didn't exist
[04:10:21.080 --> 04:10:28.680]  that's right they call it a hollow tube and and and it's not even a tube in a tube it's a building
[04:10:28.680 --> 04:10:34.440]  in a tube it is a different actually there's two different types of structural systems it combined
[04:10:34.440 --> 04:10:38.920]  into one and it turns out building seven was overbuilt as the emergency fema new york bunker
[04:10:40.360 --> 04:10:48.040]  yes and it magically course cia was based in it yeah that's right uh and uh this uh this shows the
[04:10:48.040 --> 04:10:54.760]  outer columns there there are three foot three uh center to center uh the glass in between them uh
[04:10:55.560 --> 04:11:02.600]  from from steel to steel edge it's only two foot one and with a with a column with the glass
[04:11:02.600 --> 04:11:07.400]  mullions in there the the the width of glass in there what you could actually look out of was only
[04:11:07.400 --> 04:11:16.840]  18 inches wide and uh these things run top to bottom and they are connected uh with by both
[04:11:16.840 --> 04:11:22.600]  bolts and steel clips and oh i want you to look at this too this this portion right here
[04:11:22.600 --> 04:11:29.000]  is the spandrel it's 54 inches deep that's four foot six and it's two inches of steel and it's
[04:11:29.000 --> 04:11:36.280]  welded to every column on the outer face and that is what is actually carrying any kind of any
[04:11:36.280 --> 04:11:44.200]  kind of damage that gets done to this exterior wall uh anything above it wherever these columns
[04:11:44.200 --> 04:11:51.000]  are severed anything that's above it gets transferred over to the end columns on either side of it
[04:11:51.000 --> 04:11:58.040]  by these heavy steel spandrels that are 54 inches deep and the other thing i wanted to talk about
[04:11:58.040 --> 04:12:03.320]  this is what kind of shocked me when you see these trusses you think well the main ones are running
[04:12:03.320 --> 04:12:10.040]  out to the wall so the corrugation in a steel always you always want to put it perpendicular
[04:12:10.040 --> 04:12:18.360]  to your main trusses so it should be running this way but they turned it they turned it so the main
[04:12:18.360 --> 04:12:23.960]  weight bearing trusses are actually running parallel to the outer wall and they did that so
[04:12:23.960 --> 04:12:31.320]  they would make this diaphragm more powerful hitting towards the exterior wall so this doesn't
[04:12:31.320 --> 04:12:36.680]  buckle up this isn't going to roll up when you hit it it's going to act like a knife blade it just
[04:12:36.680 --> 04:12:43.080]  won't buckle it is going to be very difficult to bulk buckle because all the corrugations are going
[04:12:43.080 --> 04:12:47.960]  to add a bunch of plastic and aluminum slamming into it it's going to look like a cheese grater
[04:12:47.960 --> 04:12:56.280]  it is and it's and running in both ways as you can see this heavy here and and little slots so
[04:12:56.280 --> 04:13:03.160]  it's it's going to shred it and so that once it goes past this wall there's very little that's in
[04:13:03.160 --> 04:13:08.200]  a very large piece to do much damage at all and when you study some of the photographs one of
[04:13:08.200 --> 04:13:12.680]  the best ones I've seen which has this woman standing in it I think we've all seen that woman
[04:13:12.680 --> 04:13:18.760]  standing in that slot on the north building where the where it went in waving a shirt yeah these
[04:13:18.760 --> 04:13:25.400]  these columns that you see here they weren't totally uh uh intact and blown back into the
[04:13:25.400 --> 04:13:30.280]  building they were still hanging there like a loose tooth meaning they they didn't really
[04:13:30.280 --> 04:13:35.960]  get rid of me it wasn't like totally blown off on the initial impact point when it had its most
[04:13:35.960 --> 04:13:40.920]  force and the entire plane went through that space it couldn't even knock those out and correct
[04:13:40.920 --> 04:13:45.640]  they could and as it goes in it dissipates and loses force that's like general benton k parton
[04:13:45.640 --> 04:13:50.280]  who immediately went to oklahoma city because he was watching the news and they said the truck
[04:13:50.280 --> 04:13:55.800]  the rider truck was here and it was a little bitty crater and he saw columns right by it not even
[04:13:55.800 --> 04:14:01.960]  damaged but way back in the back blasted off with blast points at an angle where controlled
[04:14:01.960 --> 04:14:05.720]  demolitions have been put in because you don't want to blow a column straight across it a lot of
[04:14:05.720 --> 04:14:10.360]  times will stay you know with its own weight on top of the other you got a blast in an edge
[04:14:10.360 --> 04:14:16.040]  and he said blast points only imperial storm troopers are so precise correct and he also said
[04:14:16.040 --> 04:14:23.800]  that uh the uh the uh exponential loss of power uh from that is tremendous and he said it wouldn't
[04:14:23.800 --> 04:14:29.160]  even take a ceiling a ceiling tiles out you know just the lay in ceiling tiles at like
[04:14:29.160 --> 04:14:35.400]  30 feet or so so uh that was an amazing uh yeah general partner who was a great uh did a great
[04:14:35.400 --> 04:14:43.080]  job on that uh again again this is probably uh this is showing how all the damage that were done
[04:14:43.080 --> 04:14:50.040]  by these jets uh on the world trade center was very compartmentalized by the nature of how it is
[04:14:50.040 --> 04:14:55.960]  built uh since there are trusses running in both directions for these floors it is called a space
[04:14:55.960 --> 04:15:01.240]  frame and uh i thought maybe i was taking a little liberty and calling it a space frame
[04:15:01.240 --> 04:15:06.920]  but even the authors back in in the 70s uh when they were writing about this building they too
[04:15:06.920 --> 04:15:12.680]  used the term space frame floors so i'm going to do it too and they are acting like a space frame
[04:15:12.680 --> 04:15:18.680]  floor so the reason why all of us interlocks to support everything else right so the reason why
[04:15:18.680 --> 04:15:26.040]  this this now if there were only uh trusses running in one direction and you crashed into it here
[04:15:26.680 --> 04:15:31.160]  all these floors would completely collapse all the way down here because they were running the full
[04:15:31.160 --> 04:15:36.920]  length well uh that's not what was happening since there were trusses running in both directions
[04:15:36.920 --> 04:15:42.280]  these are still held by the outer columns that were still in place so these are acting like
[04:15:42.280 --> 04:15:50.040]  huge being a huge columns here now and now all these spandrels up here that are that are on the
[04:15:50.040 --> 04:15:56.120]  outer face connecting all the steel columns that there these are all heavy beams going back to
[04:15:56.120 --> 04:16:00.520]  these heavy columns and you got the giant trestle tying it all together and that's right even if
[04:16:00.520 --> 04:16:06.120]  you did have a loss of all this this this train trestle type thing five stories tall i've never
[04:16:06.120 --> 04:16:12.040]  heard a jaw was hitting something this big that's because they didn't again look at these last
[04:16:12.040 --> 04:16:18.200]  points i'm using star wars analogy oh okay okay well what i here's another fun way to think about
[04:16:18.200 --> 04:16:24.600]  this because of the relativity of things you can also think of this as a billion pound
[04:16:25.240 --> 04:16:36.440]  flash water hitting a 300 ton uh airplane so it's just another way of of looking it'd be like a fly
[04:16:36.440 --> 04:16:40.520]  hitting a fly swatter and the whole fly swatter collapsed correct in a little bird next time you
[04:16:40.520 --> 04:16:49.880]  hit a fly be very careful if this would be true i'm sorry for the cheesy star wars analogy it's
[04:16:49.880 --> 04:16:53.240]  actually i never heard of sand people hitting something this big we're having a little we're
[04:16:53.240 --> 04:16:58.200]  having a good time no no that's a false flag in star wars episode four yeah when they blow up the
[04:16:58.200 --> 04:17:02.760]  sand crawler and obi-wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker there and he's going i've never heard of sand people
[04:17:02.760 --> 04:17:06.840]  you know hitting something this big and some nomads with little bitty pop guns and obi-wan
[04:17:06.840 --> 04:17:11.160]  kenobi says that's because they didn't we're made to believe they did he goes look at these
[04:17:11.160 --> 04:17:16.360]  blast points you know this was done professionally the point is to say that guys in a cave did this
[04:17:16.360 --> 04:17:20.920]  and that and that all the laws of science were suspended and the norab is running drills of
[04:17:20.920 --> 04:17:27.320]  the exact same targets being attacked and you've got it just goes on and on and on and on and on
[04:17:27.320 --> 04:17:32.840]  and then building sevens hit by nothing and just implodes in on itself it's just insane well not
[04:17:32.840 --> 04:17:42.200]  only that we have on building seven we have the the man that bought the lease on the world trade
[04:17:42.200 --> 04:17:48.600]  center six weeks before it occurred larry silverstein has this conversation on pbs where he admits
[04:17:48.600 --> 04:17:54.760]  that he got a call from the fire department and said they weren't sure they could control the
[04:17:54.760 --> 04:18:00.600]  fire in the building seven and he said well since we had such a tremendous loss of life maybe the
[04:18:00.600 --> 04:18:06.040]  smartest thing to do is just pull it and then they made the decision to pull and we watched it fall
[04:18:06.040 --> 04:18:11.000]  down and then they lie and say that doesn't mean control demolition but five minutes later on the
[04:18:11.000 --> 04:18:17.320]  same show they they show them destroying the wreckage of six and five and they say getting ready
[04:18:17.320 --> 04:18:22.760]  to pull building six it's a guy with a southern accent and they blow it up well and i've actually
[04:18:22.760 --> 04:18:28.760]  heard this this kills me alexa they tried to repair that later by saying well what we meant
[04:18:28.760 --> 04:18:33.720]  by pull was pull the fireman out well why would they be watching that waiting for the building
[04:18:33.720 --> 04:18:38.840]  to fall down after they pull the fireman were the fireman holding it up i mean that has nothing to
[04:18:39.480 --> 04:18:43.640]  that that yeah we pulled the fireman out and watched the building come down yeah that's so they
[04:18:43.640 --> 04:18:49.640]  didn't say they said we gave the order to pull it that is correct and you got bbc 25 minutes before
[04:18:49.640 --> 04:18:53.720]  on two channels the exact same words i predicted it was roiders that fed them because i know they
[04:18:53.720 --> 04:18:59.720]  feed bbc news a lot 24 in world bbc 24 and world yeah announced solomon brothers fell in its own
[04:18:59.720 --> 04:19:05.240]  footprint from the fires she's broadcasting it's right behind her yes yeah i mean you know well
[04:19:05.240 --> 04:19:11.480]  another thing architects and engineers for 9 11 truth are now talking about is bringing a uh uh
[04:19:11.480 --> 04:19:19.320]  full and a uh a grand jury investigation of uh uh i i show them what's his name sundar
[04:19:19.320 --> 04:19:28.040]  i can't i can't uh say i think it's syam syam sundar who is head of uh i believe that was nest
[04:19:28.040 --> 04:19:37.000]  and he's uh head of it and head of the uh review of the collapse of building seven and uh so and
[04:19:37.000 --> 04:19:44.040]  let me tell you something when he first said that uh he had come up that the nest had come up with a
[04:19:44.040 --> 04:19:51.160]  new way to review uh the collapse of this building uh and that architects and engineers should now
[04:19:51.160 --> 04:19:56.040]  consider thermal expansion i almost fell out of my chair i thought that was the funniest thing i'd
[04:19:56.040 --> 04:20:02.600]  ever heard this guy's a stand-up comic he ought to be hired by the aia to do uh banquets for him
[04:20:02.600 --> 04:20:09.800]  because thermal expansion is everyday business of architects i mean the this is no new thing and to
[04:20:09.800 --> 04:20:14.760]  say that they've come up with a new way to analyze a building and it's called thermal expansion is a
[04:20:14.760 --> 04:20:22.520]  riot and then he said on top of that that only one column failed and caused uh ultimately global
[04:20:22.520 --> 04:20:29.240]  collapse well that's insane because there if any building is ever built where one column can
[04:20:29.800 --> 04:20:35.400]  collapse and cause global collapse then you should never enter a building over two or three stores
[04:20:35.400 --> 04:20:40.440]  tall ever again because this is insane well by the way they're now changing the insurance rules
[04:20:40.440 --> 04:20:47.560]  saying we believe a big ladder can burn a building down none never collapsed until 9 11 3 did now we've
[04:20:47.560 --> 04:20:53.960]  had uh all these other big skyscrapers burned for days sometimes towering infernos nothing collapses
[04:20:53.960 --> 04:20:58.920]  but a few sheet rock and tiling you know metal supports just in roofs for like air conditioning
[04:20:58.920 --> 04:21:04.600]  the whole building still there it never happens they were they were talking about the uh echelon
[04:21:04.600 --> 04:21:08.920]  building we're getting ready for it to collapse when stack flew his airplane in look there's all
[04:21:08.920 --> 04:21:14.200]  these big fires it's going to collapse yeah it's going to collapse because they say so right right
[04:21:14.200 --> 04:21:18.520]  i mean that's like saying you shoot mount rushmore with a bb gun and the whole mountain collapses i
[04:21:18.520 --> 04:21:24.520]  mean it's just right right it's uh it's uh they've just carried this way too far and we need to stop
[04:21:24.520 --> 04:21:30.920]  this uh we need to actually uh now look at that chinese skyscraper does i remember that one the
[04:21:30.920 --> 04:21:38.840]  the hotel um then there's the madrid madrid tower in spain now now look at seven a few fires and
[04:21:38.840 --> 04:21:46.440]  three or four floors that start after they evacuate um barry jennings comes out and says the fire
[04:21:46.440 --> 04:21:49.720]  department told us because they were being told what to do the debunkers always say oh you're
[04:21:49.720 --> 04:21:53.000]  saying the fire department didn't know they were being ordered we have the cops that were there
[04:21:53.000 --> 04:22:01.480]  that heard the countdown for building seven we have the video of uh of amy goodman doing her local
[04:22:01.480 --> 04:22:04.600]  new york show and she's told get out of there and you see her start running and then it blows up
[04:22:04.600 --> 04:22:09.800]  oh alec and i've interviewed the cops that were there and saw and heard the countdown and the cops
[04:22:09.800 --> 04:22:14.920]  are like run for your lives ah they start running and it's boom boom boom and you could hear the
[04:22:14.920 --> 04:22:20.600]  blast everything another righteous thing that i think is the idea that these buildings could have
[04:22:20.600 --> 04:22:26.760]  been wired by the contractors who built them i've had people bring that up to me i said i and we
[04:22:26.760 --> 04:22:36.120]  wouldn't dare uh specify that a building be charged with explosives so we could take it down later
[04:22:36.120 --> 04:22:43.240]  when they become obsolete and and uh so those buildings had to the building seven for sure
[04:22:43.240 --> 04:22:49.400]  had to be wired ahead of time and if it if it was wired ahead of time seven then one and two
[04:22:49.400 --> 04:22:52.760]  certainly well we know they had all these drills the months before they have all these
[04:22:52.760 --> 04:22:59.240]  maintenance floors and hatches yeah we know that unorthodox fireproofing was put in yeah and then
[04:22:59.240 --> 04:23:05.160]  you got the nisk guys putting out all these fairy tales they happen to be out of less than 20 top
[04:23:05.160 --> 04:23:10.840]  explosive nanothermine experts from decoupler uh experts at nasa that's what they use it for
[04:23:10.840 --> 04:23:15.640]  they just so happen to be writing the report amazing and i i mean i wonder if we're seeing
[04:23:15.640 --> 04:23:21.800]  the planners of this are then the guys that come in to the cover up yes uh yeah absolutely i don't
[04:23:21.800 --> 04:23:27.160]  know why not i mean uh who better to do it than those who orchestrated it you have controlled
[04:23:28.120 --> 04:23:33.720]  demolition incorporated that was hired to do the to destroy the the oklahoma city building
[04:23:33.720 --> 04:23:38.520]  then they took it under guarded a wacken hut facility poured concrete in with it to cover it up
[04:23:39.480 --> 04:23:44.360]  similarly that was done at weiko then they're the company that removes all this yeah kind of amazing
[04:23:44.360 --> 04:23:51.000]  kind of amazing uh the other thing back to uh the larry silverstein comment that the uh that
[04:23:51.000 --> 04:23:55.240]  certainly know that the fire department did not wire the buildings that they didn't have
[04:23:55.240 --> 04:24:00.120]  the money of funds to do that no they sent their people in the dive that they didn't know exactly
[04:24:00.120 --> 04:24:04.120]  right that's exactly they wonder why all the feds were there for a drill they had tripod too
[04:24:04.120 --> 04:24:08.200]  with hundreds of feds running around with fema the night before yes like what's going on all
[04:24:08.200 --> 04:24:12.760]  these guys and all this equipment oh we're just training for terror and you'll enjoy it tomorrow
[04:24:12.760 --> 04:24:19.400]  believe me i have a question too if if i would have been a police officer and if i'd have been
[04:24:19.400 --> 04:24:26.200]  in the fbi and i'd heard a man say what larry silverstein said regarding building seven i would
[04:24:26.200 --> 04:24:34.520]  have i personally would have would have sought him out and arrested him and at least to interrogate
[04:24:34.520 --> 04:24:40.440]  and find out more about that because i can't imagine him making that statement and that
[04:24:40.440 --> 04:24:46.920]  and nobody even phoned this guy i mean this did a report on listen we we've had we are changed go
[04:24:46.920 --> 04:24:52.840]  out and it's in truth rising lucradowski and others and his goons walk up they command the cops
[04:24:52.840 --> 04:24:56.360]  they go you're not allowed to protest across the street we go this city property we're allowed to
[04:24:56.360 --> 04:25:01.640]  protest here with building seven was pulled and they said uh we're going to say you have bombs
[04:25:01.640 --> 04:25:06.760]  on you we know you don't have bombs we're going to put you in prison for terrorism and they call
[04:25:06.760 --> 04:25:11.560]  the cops and the cops show up and grab their camera and they go this is a gun your backpack's a bomb
[04:25:11.560 --> 04:25:16.200]  get out of here we're going to charge you with terrorism so the cops are so corrupt in new york
[04:25:16.200 --> 04:25:20.680]  at least the ones that work for silvestain and his goons it's like it's people out of the sopranos
[04:25:20.680 --> 04:25:25.160]  i don't know if you've seen this video but they walk up and go hey you know you're gonna go to
[04:25:25.800 --> 04:25:32.600]  the prison for the bomb you got need to move along a little bit here man hey listen to me boy
[04:25:32.600 --> 04:25:41.960]  i mean this is bad isn't it this is bad stuff well you know we run this country now that's it
[04:25:41.960 --> 04:25:46.360]  ron avry and uh so there's thousands of architects out there so we can't kill y'all
[04:25:47.000 --> 04:25:52.280]  we're gonna stage another attack in america and we're gonna blame it on you people and we're
[04:25:52.280 --> 04:25:57.400]  already setting it up with glenn beckon others you got that we want to kill three thousand of you
[04:25:57.400 --> 04:26:05.080]  we're gonna do it that's it we run this country boy you're not gonna stand up against us i'm with
[04:26:05.080 --> 04:26:11.960]  you alex are you're taking it right out of my mind man they're very they're very mad a lot of red
[04:26:11.960 --> 04:26:15.480]  blooded people are shinin up to them and they're like okay go ahead and kill us you know you can't
[04:26:15.480 --> 04:26:21.000]  kill us all guys we're gonna bring you down i hear you the truth will bring them down ultimately
[04:26:21.000 --> 04:26:26.600]  truth catches up and it's on the way and they better think twice if they're planning on nuke
[04:26:26.600 --> 04:26:31.320]  in some town and blaming it on some patriots because i i don't know if that's gonna fly or not
[04:26:31.320 --> 04:26:35.320]  and i'm glad we're talking about all this stuff because you know they're thinking about it because
[04:26:35.320 --> 04:26:38.920]  the only way you know they're listening right now are you kidding i'll be falling home today
[04:26:38.920 --> 04:26:44.840]  listen because let me say this uh talk to them let's let's talk directly let's talk right to them
[04:26:44.840 --> 04:26:52.920]  the uh the the the only way they can protect themselves from this 9 11 thing is by doing a
[04:26:52.920 --> 04:26:59.560]  larger event and blaming it on whoever they want to but it would be convenient to blame it on to
[04:26:59.560 --> 04:27:05.720]  patriots well they're now saying patriots work with al-qaeda oh yeah yeah and uh they connect them
[04:27:05.720 --> 04:27:11.800]  to somebody that has a problem with his uh paying the irs this is a pre-story i don't know if you
[04:27:11.800 --> 04:27:15.800]  heard me in the months before yeah gonna hit austin they're gonna blame tea parties in 9 11
[04:27:15.800 --> 04:27:20.600]  and and now the shooting guaranteed evidence well wasn't that convenient right there with the medina
[04:27:20.600 --> 04:27:26.520]  thing you had the medina uh run in with glenn back and it wasn't shortly after that pow this guy runs
[04:27:26.520 --> 04:27:32.360]  into the irs office with his plane well back every day saying these tea party the bad ones
[04:27:32.360 --> 04:27:36.920]  these birthers they're gonna attack and the 9 11ers are gonna attack and suddenly it all starts
[04:27:36.920 --> 04:27:42.200]  yes and i couldn't believe it when i read what he was upset about he was upset about a provision
[04:27:42.200 --> 04:27:49.080]  1706 and the tax code and went 1706 what he did all that for 1706 wait till he hears that
[04:27:49.080 --> 04:27:56.760]  you're not supposed to pay on your uh individual uh uh income from wages i mean wow i'm glad he
[04:27:56.760 --> 04:28:01.880]  didn't read that he had probably done the white house you know was clearly written by feds yes i
[04:28:01.880 --> 04:28:07.160]  agree oh you're it's all staged i mean i and and i don't know how much longer i got on this earth
[04:28:07.160 --> 04:28:11.240]  but i'm just glad i've had time to fight these people i think i got less time you thought i'm
[04:28:11.240 --> 04:28:17.400]  better shaped than you are i don't know no i love i love being alive i mean there it's these are real
[04:28:17.400 --> 04:28:22.600]  killers i hear they just don't want to in the past 30 years ago they killed anybody talked about this
[04:28:22.600 --> 04:28:27.880]  stuff i mean they killed literally hundreds of jfk investigators but now there's so many of us they
[04:28:27.880 --> 04:28:32.440]  know if they smash us it only makes more attention i think so too they try the demon we got to keep
[04:28:32.440 --> 04:28:37.880]  it up alex i mean everybody's got to keep this up otherwise we're all going to disappear gradually
[04:28:37.880 --> 04:28:47.000]  uh you're doing a great job too well let's do about let's run through the part we haven't
[04:28:47.000 --> 04:28:51.320]  gotten into yet here we go all right well with it there's only one more part here then let me say this
[04:28:54.040 --> 04:29:01.400]  every year architects uh have to go through eight hours of continuing education and uh usually that
[04:29:01.400 --> 04:29:07.160]  has to do with the two every year you have to do two hours of handicapped stuff so we have to figure
[04:29:07.160 --> 04:29:13.320]  out how to get the handicapped on the boat docks and basketball courts and how to set up and get it
[04:29:13.320 --> 04:29:21.560]  so they can climb mountains and things and then you have to take another uh six hours in things
[04:29:21.560 --> 04:29:27.880]  that have to do with health and welfare of the state and that's that's because that's the only
[04:29:27.880 --> 04:29:32.040]  thing they can they make you study is something that has to do with health and welfare well
[04:29:32.040 --> 04:29:37.880]  well and usually now that has to do with greening of the of the continent and gleaning and greening
[04:29:37.880 --> 04:29:44.520]  of the world uh uh uh figuring out how to build homes without moving materials over 20 miles
[04:29:45.080 --> 04:29:51.640]  uh building it out of a junk how to build new houses with dirt floors so it's all brainwashing
[04:29:51.640 --> 04:29:58.040]  taking over your industry telling you what you can do it is and and and and then so this year
[04:29:58.040 --> 04:30:02.840]  I've decided no I'm not going to do all that stuff I'm going to they'll let you do your own and so
[04:30:02.840 --> 04:30:09.240]  what I'm doing my own on this year is going to be the world trade center uh and the twin towers
[04:30:09.240 --> 04:30:15.160]  and I'm going to say that if criminals and I believe it's clear that criminals are using our
[04:30:15.160 --> 04:30:23.880]  buildings uh the products of professionals to kill people with and to set up uh national agendas
[04:30:23.880 --> 04:30:29.320]  then we need to figure out how to analyze these things and one of the questions I have
[04:30:29.320 --> 04:30:33.480]  is we need to develop the science and the mathematics and the formulas to figure out
[04:30:34.120 --> 04:30:41.640]  when something hits a great like a plane at what point does the great give way
[04:30:43.400 --> 04:30:49.880]  and this is calculatable that's a word and so this is what I'm going to be working on is
[04:30:49.880 --> 04:30:59.000]  developing more of the science of investigating accidents with buildings uh so that in the future
[04:30:59.000 --> 04:31:05.800]  we can immediately apply the science and come up with uh and let me say this I believe that this
[04:31:05.800 --> 04:31:10.440]  has already been done by the the the perpetrators of people that actually did this I think they've
[04:31:10.440 --> 04:31:16.920]  already studied it because it would be uh first of all if you were a hijacker you could hit New
[04:31:16.920 --> 04:31:24.360]  York a lot easier drive at about 200 miles an hour and you could hit a building that's only 209
[04:31:24.360 --> 04:31:33.560]  feet wide with a with a a jet that's 159 feet wide you could hit that a lot better traveling at 150
[04:31:33.560 --> 04:31:39.240]  miles an hour instead of 530 miles an hour at 530 miles an hour you're probably going to have to
[04:31:39.240 --> 04:31:44.360]  about take about 60 shots at this building because you know it's going to be really hard to hit it
[04:31:44.360 --> 04:31:52.520]  at 530 miles unless it's fly by wire unless you're right unless it's guided and joe stack's little
[04:31:52.520 --> 04:31:58.280]  hanger will just so happen to be by the homeland security top expert or remote control aircraft
[04:31:58.280 --> 04:32:04.840]  that's pretty handy that's pretty handy I guess that's just another coincidence right these people
[04:32:04.840 --> 04:32:10.760]  are unbelievable well alex that's all my pretty charts for the day you know here's that article
[04:32:10.760 --> 04:32:15.000]  at a raw story it's up on info wars and prison planet here's the white house document ron
[04:32:16.040 --> 04:32:24.040]  they ordered them not to investigate the attacks amazing amazing amazing are you handing these
[04:32:24.040 --> 04:32:29.320]  to me to keep or just look at well I guess the guys can print me more but we're that's all right
[04:32:29.320 --> 04:32:32.920]  we've got them posted up on info wars and prison planet oh do you have you just earlier hadn't
[04:32:32.920 --> 04:32:37.560]  seen because it just came out a few hours ago okay let me tell people about this double tree

[04:35:58.600 --> 04:36:06.040]  going to our free iphone app that had five stars and saying download it and vote against it it had
[04:36:06.040 --> 04:36:10.360]  five stars but they were all showing the level of hating it doesn't even matter but i want to beat
[04:36:10.360 --> 04:36:15.960]  them on that issue go download the iphone app and give it a five star rating because it only has four
[04:36:15.960 --> 04:36:20.520]  now because the haters said hey let's get all our friends together and go in there so it doesn't have
[04:36:20.520 --> 04:36:25.800]  five stars so it gets knocked off some of the front pages of the itunes store and download that at
[04:36:25.800 --> 04:36:31.080]  big banners on the side of info wars dot com that's the type of constant stuff we deal with here so
[04:36:31.080 --> 04:36:36.360]  folks go in there rate it get it back up to five stars god bless you all see you back live tomorrow
[04:36:36.360 --> 04:36:40.040]  11 a.m. central now get out there and take on the new world order
