[00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:09.635]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:11.216]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:12.777]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.777 --> 00:00:16.978]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:21.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.373]  We are going to have wide open telephones today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:45.373 --> 00:00:51.438]  Wide open phones on this September 15th, Tuesday edition.
[00:00:51.438 --> 00:00:55.440]  September 15th, 2009.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.784]  We are going to have wide open phones throughout the full four hours.
[00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:11.869]  And Charlie Sheen is joining us coming up at 1.30 Central Standard Time today, here live on the show.
[00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:20.519]  Headline from PrisonPlanet.com, Sheen blasts cowardly corporate media refusal to debate 9-11 facts.
[00:01:23.243 --> 00:01:23.983]  Charlie Sheen.
[00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:31.387]  Now, they've been attacking him on a whole bunch of different cable networks and channels, but they refuse to debate him or even have him on.
[00:01:31.387 --> 00:01:52.317]  Now, you know for ratings that it would be good to have him on, but they cannot have him on with the points he would make, like 6 of the 10 9-11 commissioners say that the commission was a, quote, fraud, a cover-up, that the Pentagon was hiding information and lying, that there should be a criminal investigation.
[00:01:54.554 --> 00:02:02.517]  That's just one of the 20 bullet points that Sheen wrote his letter to the President trying to get the people to look at.
[00:02:02.517 --> 00:02:03.957]  And the public has looked at it.
[00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:10.719]  Tens of millions of people have read, conservatively, his 20 Minutes with the President.
[00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:18.362]  There are conservatively more than 2 million views in the different versions of his message to the President out there on the web.
[00:02:18.362 --> 00:02:20.283]  One version alone, close to 600,000 views.
[00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:29.035]  And so certainly this has been a big victory for 9-11 Truth, exposing false flag terrorism.
[00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:39.440]  Charlie Sheen responds to the hit pieces, the disinformation, the distortions about the information that he's been covering.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.741]  I also talked to him last night.
[00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:42.822]  He had dinner with Buzz Aldrin in Los Angeles.
[00:02:42.822 --> 00:02:46.284]  Maybe I'll get him to talk a little bit about that, but that's another subject.
[00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:49.525]  I haven't talked to him since he was going to meet Buzz.
[00:02:52.253 --> 00:02:55.575]  Let's just call it like 1.30 in the morning, my time.
[00:02:55.575 --> 00:03:00.919]  But Sheen coming up today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.080]  That's quite a combo.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.323]  Charlie Sheen and Buzz Aldrin hanging.
[00:03:06.323 --> 00:03:11.267]  Truth is so much stranger than fiction.
[00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:13.409]  We're working on something else on that front.
[00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.690]  I'll just leave it at that for you.
[00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:23.843]  I'm going to get Paul Watson to pop into it for about 20 minutes today, because he wrote an excellent article about this latest fake Bin Laden tape put out by the Intel Center.
[00:03:23.843 --> 00:03:27.204]  I thought we'd get his response to all of that.
[00:03:27.204 --> 00:03:38.210]  Also, from Pennsylvania to Texas, from California to New York, from Florida to Michigan, they're announcing that states are passing laws under federal funding and federal grants.
[00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.694]  The feds say, we'll give you billions of your own tax money back if you will set up warrantless checkpoints and take people's blood.
[00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:48.728]  It has nothing to do with DWI.
[00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:56.392]  They're creating special medical corps of the police to take blood for national DNA databases.
[00:03:56.392 --> 00:03:58.133]  England's already done it.
[00:03:58.133 --> 00:04:05.217]  If you get pulled over for no seatbelt, or speeding, or running a stop sign, or slow stopping, you're gonna have your blood sucked.
[00:04:05.217 --> 00:04:06.337]  It's about domination.
[00:04:06.337 --> 00:04:12.001]  Can you imagine if the Nazis were sucking people's bloods at checkpoints, how incredible that would be?
[00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:14.122]  But when it happens here in America,
[00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.181]  It is no big deal.
[00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:22.222]  No big deal at all.
[00:04:22.222 --> 00:04:23.783]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:04:23.783 --> 00:04:27.024]  Also, in fact, Hartman, I forgot to print this last night.
[00:04:27.024 --> 00:04:27.885]  I gave it to Watson.
[00:04:27.885 --> 00:04:33.528]  If you search engine the term fake robbery at pharmacy,
[00:04:34.582 --> 00:04:37.643]  It's one of the biggest pharmacy groups in the country.
[00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:40.644]  They did this fake drill and the woman almost had a heart attack.
[00:04:40.644 --> 00:04:46.526]  The pharmacist, over having a gun put to her head and told it was a robbery and that she was a hostage.
[00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:50.508]  And the company's saying, look, the insurance company told us to do that.
[00:04:50.508 --> 00:04:52.108]  What's the big deal?
[00:04:52.108 --> 00:04:53.649]  They do this to school kids everywhere.
[00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:54.889]  It's part of mind control.
[00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.350]  We'll break that down too.
[00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.830]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.111 --> 00:05:05.074]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:05:30.111 --> 00:05:30.251]  I think?
[00:06:00.592 --> 00:06:06.297]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:06:06.297 --> 00:06:07.638]  And we knew what to do.
[00:06:07.638 --> 00:06:09.620]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:16.646]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:25.173]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.665]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:32.665 --> 00:06:35.827]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[00:06:35.827 --> 00:06:41.611]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:06:41.611 --> 00:06:44.673]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:44.673 --> 00:06:51.118]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the
[00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:56.033]  Don't expose the government-sponsored terror.
[00:06:56.033 --> 00:07:00.096]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:07:00.096 --> 00:07:01.417]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:01.417 --> 00:07:07.001]  Did you know that the Global Elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:12.024]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:07:12.024 --> 00:07:15.307]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:07:15.307 --> 00:07:17.588]  And it's possible that it could even happen again.
[00:07:17.588 --> 00:07:22.292]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:07:22.813 --> 00:07:23.633]  We're good to go!
[00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:55.244]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:21.320]  Okay, I'm going to get into the economy.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:28.604]  The private banks creating a worldwide bankruptcy by design to set up their world government.
[00:08:28.604 --> 00:08:35.588]  Charlie Sheen's coming up live today on this Tuesday, September 15, 2009 edition.
[00:08:35.588 --> 00:08:37.248]  Paul Watson's popping in as well.
[00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:38.989]  We're going to have open phones.
[00:08:38.989 --> 00:08:42.711]  But I wanted to start the show with this, just to illustrate things.
[00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:47.974]  I heard local talk radio freaking out over this report.
[00:08:50.273 --> 00:08:58.622]  And I went and looked it up, and sure enough, it was an accurate rundown that I was hearing on the radio.
[00:08:58.622 --> 00:09:09.354]  But the issue is, why were the callers and the talk show hosts getting upset about something that's done to 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade children?
[00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:26.623]  All over the United States, under federal grants, the police come into schools unannounced and tell children they're hostages, tell teachers put their hands behind their heads, they're going to die.
[00:09:26.623 --> 00:09:34.507]  I remember a Minnesota case, the woman literally is a mental patient now, and took her out in the woods to quote, shoot her in the back of the head.
[00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:40.211]  They have drills in Michigan where the feds, and the locals said, well the feds told us to do it, they gave us the money,
[00:09:41.107 --> 00:09:56.128]  They tell the school kids, the third and fourth graders in this one case, that homeschoolers were coming to kill them, and men in camouflage marched them outside, set off smoke grenades, put guns to the back of their heads, and threw fake blood on them.
[00:09:58.148 --> 00:09:59.289]  And this goes on everywhere.
[00:09:59.289 --> 00:10:01.030]  This is mind control.
[00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.751]  This is trauma-based mind control.
[00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:05.753]  This is re-education camp type stuff.
[00:10:05.753 --> 00:10:08.935]  Fake robbery prompts real lawsuit.
[00:10:08.935 --> 00:10:18.762]  Associated Press employee sues for PTSD, claiming gunman hired to stick up pharmacy was part of unannounced training drill.
[00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:22.502]  Of course, because you get a discount on your insurance.
[00:10:22.502 --> 00:10:33.248]  A New Jersey pharmacy technician who says she was traumatized when a masked gunman burst into her store demanding OxyContin is suing her employers for arranging the mock hold-up.
[00:10:33.248 --> 00:10:42.733]  Babette Perry says in a lawsuit that she was told in advance of the drill in December 2007 at the Hampton Behavioral Health Center.
[00:10:43.533 --> 00:10:51.399]  She says she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after the gunman entered the store, claiming he had taken another worker hostage.
[00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:54.922]  She says she tried to call for help, but the phone wasn't working.
[00:10:54.922 --> 00:10:58.105]  She later found out the gun was fake and the gunman worked for the company.
[00:10:58.105 --> 00:11:08.773]  Perry is seeking damages for the health center and its parent company, Universal Health Services, Inc., of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.
[00:11:08.773 --> 00:11:12.376]  The General Counsel for Universal declined to comment on the case.
[00:11:14.557 --> 00:11:16.218]  Now, why is this a big deal?
[00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:35.351]  I mean, if we can do it to 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th graders, for the last decade at least, since Columbine, if they can hire former Navy SEALs to practice taking over Dallas schools, in fact, in one drill in Fort Worth,
[00:11:37.119 --> 00:11:48.124]  The cops shot the other cop, who happened to be cop of the year, in the back of his head, in front of the school kids, blowing his brains all over the children.
[00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:57.049]  In Michigan, in a drill, and there's video of this, the cop, the narcotics officer, shoots himself in the leg.
[00:11:59.653 --> 00:12:01.314]  I mean, you all have heard about it.
[00:12:01.314 --> 00:12:03.695]  Every few months we hear about them shooting a kid.
[00:12:03.695 --> 00:12:10.418]  They had another drill where they shot a kid in the back, but thank God they shot him in the buttocks and it didn't kill him.
[00:12:10.418 --> 00:12:23.785]  And then they have real drills where they come in and everybody line up like it's a shakedown in a Supermax prison and they throw everybody's stuff out of their lockers and dogs will grab their bag and shake it or rip their clothes off and the kids cry and the police laugh.
[00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:25.386]  It's all part of being trained to be a prisoner.
[00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:30.572]  I'll never forget, we had a lady and her lawyer on.
[00:12:30.572 --> 00:12:34.338]  It was in the Pioneer Press up in Minneapolis, St.
[00:12:34.338 --> 00:12:35.460]  Paul.
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.323]  That was a, what, 8th grade class?
[00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:40.228]  And she was in a portable building in the art class.
[00:12:41.974 --> 00:12:54.498]  I remember school, I remember once when I had an art class, it was in a portable building, out by a wooded area, out back the school on the back 40, and the police came in and dressed as terrorists and said, we're going to kill you!
[00:12:54.498 --> 00:13:05.402]  And they took the kids and the teacher outside and said the kids defecated on themselves, urinated on themselves, the teacher collapsed, and then this went on for about an hour, and then they didn't kill him!
[00:13:05.402 --> 00:13:06.522]  Dressed as terrorists!
[00:13:06.522 --> 00:13:10.884]  And nobody gets in trouble, because the schools are for trauma-based mind control.
[00:13:11.795 --> 00:13:15.976]  And it's trauma-based mind control on the police to train them all of this is normal.
[00:13:15.976 --> 00:13:26.579]  Government does asinine, over-the-top things to set precedence.
[00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:36.501]  Here is another AP article, Preventative Terror Raids.
[00:13:36.501 --> 00:13:39.962]  Preventative Terror Raids targets New York City apartments.
[00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:56.082]  Preventative terror raids targets NYC apartments.
[00:13:56.082 --> 00:14:04.868]  Remember Bill Clinton said on that MTV show in 1992 when he was running for president?
[00:14:04.868 --> 00:14:12.152]  He said, we're going to have preventative anti-gun raids at all the government housing facilities looking for illegal guns.
[00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:19.113]  That's right, no more Fourth Amendment, no more Fifth Amendment.
[00:14:19.113 --> 00:14:21.715]  We just come in and do what we want, when we want.
[00:14:21.715 --> 00:14:25.519]  The investigation of suspected Al-Qaeda associate prompted the preemptive raid.
[00:14:26.664 --> 00:14:27.545]  It's like preemptive wars.
[00:14:51.144 --> 00:14:59.976]  Senator Charles Schumer said law enforcement action was unrelated to President Barack Obama's visit to the city Monday, or the fake flyover they did through D.C.
[00:14:59.976 --> 00:15:04.181]  with Air Force One, or the whole fake thing with the patrol boats last Friday.
[00:15:08.834 --> 00:15:09.974]  And now it's updated.
[00:15:09.974 --> 00:15:14.596]  Five New York homes, not just apartments, raided in terrorism probe.
[00:15:14.596 --> 00:15:16.657]  Says no imminent danger.
[00:15:16.657 --> 00:15:20.199]  Focus on one man who met with people in Queens.
[00:15:20.199 --> 00:15:23.720]  Apartments shared by five Afghan men, search witnesses said.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.021]  Militant ideology, sympathetic Al Qaeda.
[00:15:27.021 --> 00:15:30.183]  Detected.
[00:15:30.183 --> 00:15:35.005]  So that's the type of news that we have on that front.
[00:15:35.005 --> 00:15:37.606]  Meanwhile, all these states
[00:15:39.298 --> 00:15:41.980]  I'm going to cover this after we take some calls.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.021]  Multiple states!
[00:15:43.021 --> 00:15:46.683]  Every time I look at a state, you can just Google the name of your state.
[00:15:46.683 --> 00:15:52.107]  I did Texas, I did Pennsylvania, I did Ohio, I did New York, I did Florida.
[00:15:52.107 --> 00:15:59.872]  And every time I search the term, Ohio, Pennsylvania, whatever the case was.
[00:15:59.872 --> 00:16:04.576]  So I don't know of all 50 have done this, but I know it's always federal grants.
[00:16:04.576 --> 00:16:06.037]  I know Texas has done it this year.
[00:16:08.697 --> 00:16:23.354]  But every state I randomly checked last night, spent about 20 minutes on it, if you just search the name of your state and police to draw blood without warrant, or new law, police to draw blood without warrant, that's what I found!
[00:16:23.354 --> 00:16:27.219]  And I found the statesman headline, police draw blood without warrant for first time.
[00:16:28.203 --> 00:16:32.524]  That was the Austin American Statesman headline last week, and they've got mobile RVs.
[00:16:32.524 --> 00:16:36.545]  See, first, and I told you this was for acclamation just to have no warrants.
[00:16:36.545 --> 00:16:44.866]  First, the feds would have the police go get these rubber stamp fake warrants from a judge that just said, take any blood you want.
[00:16:44.866 --> 00:16:49.687]  Not listing the person or places to be searched, you know, just totally fake.
[00:16:49.687 --> 00:16:53.168]  Just judges just swearing out rubber stamp warrants.
[00:16:53.168 --> 00:16:55.229]  Just like they did with warrantless wiretaps.
[00:16:55.229 --> 00:16:57.149]  They just had random warrants for millions of people.
[00:16:59.912 --> 00:17:02.636]  These letters of mark on our freedoms.
[00:17:02.636 --> 00:17:09.707]  Well, after they got done and you accepted that, well, hell, why not just go ahead and have no warrants?
[00:17:09.707 --> 00:17:13.613]  And some states say if there's a kid in the car or if it's dark or
[00:17:18.326 --> 00:17:24.609]  You've got a prior DWI, but if you read the way the laws are written, some states just say no more warrants, period.
[00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:34.753]  Other states have these wide reasons, and then next year they'll, or the next time your legislator's in session, they'll just say they can put you in a ditch and shoot you in the back of the head.
[00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:40.275]  I mean, that's already Chicago and Illinois have said, if you run, we're going to kill you.
[00:17:40.275 --> 00:17:44.197]  If you run from a traffic stop, if you don't stop immediately, we're going to gun you down.
[00:17:45.657 --> 00:17:47.358]  Remember that headline, CBS News?
[00:17:47.358 --> 00:17:50.821]  Like it was good, and people were commenting, oh, this is wonderful, yes.
[00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:54.404]  Kill everybody, basically.
[00:17:54.404 --> 00:17:59.948]  Because foreign banks are breaking us right now.
[00:17:59.948 --> 00:18:04.271]  And we have less freedom on the books than China and Russia currently.
[00:18:04.271 --> 00:18:08.955]  That's right, in China and in Russia, I've looked at their laws, they have more freedoms on the books than we do.
[00:18:10.458 --> 00:18:16.959]  We are, in major university studies, number six worst police state in the world.
[00:18:16.959 --> 00:18:26.101]  We've still got free speech, but they're openly announcing they're going to start getting rid of that, and under the Cybersecurity Act, they're shutting down the web, openly announcing it.
[00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:31.882]  Under the Cyberbullying Act, if you hurt someone's feelings, not even if it's illegal, you get arrested as a federal felon.
[00:18:31.882 --> 00:18:36.923]  And under the hate crime law that's passed the House, you don't have to hurt anybody, call for violence, you get arrested.
[00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:41.219]  They're openly saying the Fairness Doctrine for the Internet as well.
[00:18:41.219 --> 00:18:42.440]  It's here.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.620]  It's happening.
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.742]  It's going on.
[00:18:45.742 --> 00:18:58.610]  And it's all about raising taxes to the point of you go bankrupt and the local banks take your home into receivership and then they're going to give your home to local government officials that carry out the crimes.
[00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:04.754]  And a whole bunch of states, we've covered it here, are now giving repossessed homes to police and firemen and government workers.
[00:19:06.803 --> 00:19:07.484]  You understand?
[00:19:07.484 --> 00:19:11.647]  They're going to move into your house and they're going to take your daughter and they're going to rape her.
[00:19:11.647 --> 00:19:12.507]  You think I'm joking?
[00:19:12.507 --> 00:19:14.589]  This happens everywhere else.
[00:19:14.589 --> 00:19:15.770]  In Cuba.
[00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.031]  In China.
[00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:19.153]  In Russia.
[00:19:19.153 --> 00:19:21.134]  In Germany.
[00:19:21.134 --> 00:19:23.316]  It's already happening in England.
[00:19:23.316 --> 00:19:27.839]  Whole police forces now in many areas of Florida are completely criminal run.
[00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:31.022]  The CPS in many states is completely pedophile run.
[00:19:31.022 --> 00:19:33.744]  Here in Texas it's almost completely pedophile run.
[00:19:33.744 --> 00:19:34.685]  They openly have
[00:19:35.865 --> 00:19:39.087]  Giant child brothels and no one gets in trouble.
[00:19:39.087 --> 00:19:44.752]  It's just hellish criminals taking over, kicking out the final good people in government.
[00:19:44.752 --> 00:19:51.837]  Just absolutely going to rape everybody financially and physically if we don't wake up and say no.
[00:19:51.837 --> 00:19:57.961]  And they know we're waking up, so they're putting that Benedict Arnold in there, Glenn Beck, to lead everybody down a rat hole.
[00:19:57.961 --> 00:19:58.562]  God help us.
[00:20:00.495 --> 00:20:08.283]  Robert Beatle's new book, Here's What You Do, was written for anyone who wants to survive the upcoming and ongoing financial storm.
[00:20:08.283 --> 00:20:13.327]  Get prepared and go to here'swhatyoudo.net and buy the $6 book.
[00:20:13.327 --> 00:20:18.873]  He is also trying to help us by running for Congress to stop the thievery and loss of liberties.
[00:20:19.113 --> 00:20:23.818]  Please arm yourself with his guide and go to hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:20:23.818 --> 00:20:25.981]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:27.823]  Hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:20:27.823 --> 00:20:30.266]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:20:30.266 --> 00:20:31.888]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:20:31.888 --> 00:20:36.413]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, inflation?
[00:20:36.413 --> 00:20:40.037]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman of the International Forecaster.
[00:20:40.137 --> 00:20:40.377]  We're good.
[00:21:03.664 --> 00:21:07.165]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:09.485]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:21:09.485 --> 00:21:17.827]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:21:17.827 --> 00:21:25.269]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:28.589]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:21:28.589 --> 00:21:31.330]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.130]  NSA spying.
[00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:37.013]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:21:37.013 --> 00:21:40.954]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:21:40.954 --> 00:21:43.235]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:47.677]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:22:00.253 --> 00:22:01.955]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[00:22:01.955 --> 00:22:02.376]  September 15, 2009.
[00:22:02.376 --> 00:22:03.457]  Gold opened this morning at $9.99.70.
[00:22:03.457 --> 00:22:07.061]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1,027.86, $5.13.93 for a half-ounce, or $2.56.96 for the quarter-ounce.
[00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:07.562]  That's $1,027.86, $5.13.93, or $2.56.96.
[00:22:20.317 --> 00:22:33.941]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:22:33.941 --> 00:22:35.182]  Is this capitalism?
[00:22:35.182 --> 00:22:42.764]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:42.764 --> 00:22:43.865]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:43.865 --> 00:22:48.006]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:22:48.226 --> 00:22:49.467]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.467 --> 00:22:54.133]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[00:22:54.133 --> 00:22:54.593]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:54.593 --> 00:22:57.376]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:57.376 --> 00:23:03.523]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Hunter safes.
[00:23:03.523 --> 00:23:07.147]  The makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[00:23:07.267 --> 00:23:10.128]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.

[00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:21.353]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[00:23:21.353 --> 00:23:23.914]  At Graf Undersafes, security is their sole purpose.

[00:23:34.898 --> 00:23:43.566]  They have established an unequal reputation of quality for supplying their safes and vault doors to residential customers, commercial markets, and the jewelry industry alike.
[00:23:43.566 --> 00:23:45.428]  Protect the things you care about most.
[00:23:45.428 --> 00:23:46.929]  Go to graphundersafes.com.

[00:23:51.593 --> 00:23:54.036]  Or click on their banner at infowars.com today.
[00:23:54.036 --> 00:23:54.556]  Or call 866-457-1801.
[00:23:54.556 --> 00:23:54.816]  That's 866-457-1801.
[00:24:13.471 --> 00:24:15.553]  They've always got a good excuse.
[00:24:15.553 --> 00:24:21.958]  We're going to unannounced go pull guns on your kids and tell them we're really terrorists that are going to kill them to stop Al Qaeda.
[00:24:23.342 --> 00:24:26.004]  Or to stop evil homeschoolers that want to come kill your kids.
[00:24:26.004 --> 00:24:27.406]  They actually tell them that.
[00:24:27.406 --> 00:24:30.108]  We're going to take your blood at checkpoints.
[00:24:30.108 --> 00:24:39.516]  It's like a bully when you're 10 years old and the 14 year old bully beats you up and wrestles you to the ground and then sits on top of your chest and spits in your face.
[00:24:39.516 --> 00:24:40.957]  I had a couple bullies do that to me.
[00:24:40.957 --> 00:24:44.561]  It must be like their specialty.
[00:24:44.561 --> 00:24:46.742]  And I've been told by others they had bullies do that to them.
[00:24:47.935 --> 00:24:54.621]  Now, later, when you get a little bit older and you put the bully in the hospital, it's not funny when you actually break their nose and knock their teeth out.
[00:24:54.621 --> 00:25:02.188]  But, then they whine and try to sue you and, you know, that's how it always works when they're spitting up teeth.
[00:25:02.188 --> 00:25:04.811]  And it's going to be the same way with the government.
[00:25:04.811 --> 00:25:13.419]  The government's just squatting on us, going, I'm going to steal $23.7 trillion, and I'm going to take your blood at checkpoints because it's to stop the drunk drivers.
[00:25:14.514 --> 00:25:24.386]  When they admit that people on psychotropic drugs are killing three times what the drunk drivers are.
[00:25:24.386 --> 00:25:29.252]  Texting kills twice what the drunks do.
[00:25:29.252 --> 00:25:33.017]  But see, it's always, oh, we're not going to get a warrant.
[00:25:34.164 --> 00:25:38.347]  I mean, they could have a judge there and swear out a real warrant, but they don't want to do that.
[00:25:38.347 --> 00:25:40.809]  And the Feds paid to do this.
[00:25:40.809 --> 00:25:43.991]  Because they want to set the precedent to take fluid out of your body.
[00:25:43.991 --> 00:25:48.514]  There's an international treaty to set up a worldwide DNA database.
[00:25:48.514 --> 00:25:52.277]  And you can say, well, drunk drivers deserve it and we should get rid of the Bill of Rights.
[00:25:52.277 --> 00:25:53.017]  Okay, fine.
[00:25:53.017 --> 00:25:55.259]  For sake of argument, you believe it.
[00:25:55.259 --> 00:25:55.959]  Fine.
[00:25:55.959 --> 00:25:57.020]  What about newborn babies?
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:57.641]  Do they deserve it?
[00:25:59.895 --> 00:26:11.959]  Because for 36, almost 37 years, and I broke this 13 years ago, and it's now mainstream news admitted, they take your blood at birth and put it in a UN database.
[00:26:11.959 --> 00:26:17.001]  University of Texas runs all the southwest states in Texas and Oklahoma.
[00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:24.363]  It keeps all the blood going back to 1973.
[00:26:24.363 --> 00:26:28.505]  Keeps all your blood for eugenics and research, and they admit it all now!
[00:26:29.804 --> 00:26:33.905]  I'll never forget, uh, earlier this year, was it in January?
[00:26:33.905 --> 00:26:35.786]  I almost fell out of my chair on the Sunday Show.
[00:26:35.786 --> 00:26:39.087]  I was doing the Sunday Show out of NewsRadio 590KLBJ at the time.
[00:26:39.087 --> 00:26:43.428]  We now do it out of my studio, so we can also simulcast it to prisonplanet.tv.
[00:26:43.428 --> 00:26:45.829]  And I heard Sarah Hudeberg, the, uh,
[00:26:47.662 --> 00:27:01.071]  Great news girl over there reporting that they take everybody's blood at birth for a DNA database and that it's studied and used for international research and I almost fell out of my chair and I ran out and she came out of the news booth and I said, how do you know about that?
[00:27:01.071 --> 00:27:04.873]  Because I was always called a conspiracy theorist for having actual government documents.
[00:27:04.873 --> 00:27:07.875]  And she said, oh, it's in the front page of the Austin American Statesman.
[00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:08.495]  Here it is.
[00:27:08.495 --> 00:27:09.716]  And she handed it to me.
[00:27:09.716 --> 00:27:11.357]  And it was all how great it was.
[00:27:11.357 --> 00:27:15.220]  They take your blood and how sweetie cake it is.
[00:27:17.797 --> 00:27:32.725]  And you like to give your blood and pay to have your blood done for the International Registry with National Geographic and IBM sponsoring it at the Cold Springs Harbor Human Genome Project.
[00:27:32.725 --> 00:27:44.912]  If you go look up Cold Springs Harbor, that's where eugenics was started and it's still the eugenics office and all the people that work there, all the head scientists on record publish books on eugenics!
[00:27:44.912 --> 00:27:46.693]  And they've got your blood history now.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:53.841]  And they have been studying Israel, South Africa, the United States, France, and England.
[00:27:53.841 --> 00:27:56.422]  And Jane's Weapons Quarterly has been reporting for years.
[00:27:56.422 --> 00:28:12.546]  Speaking of the statesmen, they wrote an article about Cheney's PNAC document, September 20, 2000, where Cheney says, we've really got to learn how to use race-specific bioweapons and condition the public through the media to accept going after certain races.
[00:28:12.546 --> 00:28:14.247]  But see, everybody's interrelated.
[00:28:15.307 --> 00:28:23.892]  And so they're studying the different migration lines and different gene markers to really get those race-specific bioweapons tailored.
[00:28:23.892 --> 00:28:26.193]  And you're helping them so much.
[00:28:26.193 --> 00:28:29.095]  And your baby's blood is gonna help them so much.
[00:28:29.095 --> 00:28:36.218]  And then see, now if the police doesn't have your DNA database, or it wasn't stored properly, or you weren't born in the right hospital, or you're older than 36,
[00:28:38.424 --> 00:28:47.968]  They could just have their local federalized police pull you over and claim it's a DUI and that they think you're drinking and they're gonna take your blood.
[00:28:47.968 --> 00:28:54.090]  And then now they can make a race-specific virus just for Bill Jones.
[00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:56.351]  Or just for Tom Smith.
[00:28:56.351 --> 00:28:59.932]  Or just for Carol Johnson.
[00:28:59.932 --> 00:29:01.233]  Or Daryl Swartz.
[00:29:01.233 --> 00:29:04.154]  Or whatever the fictitious name is.
[00:29:06.505 --> 00:29:08.126]  Oh, isn't that sweet?
[00:29:08.126 --> 00:29:10.727]  And in the future, the local federalized police can pull you over.
[00:29:10.727 --> 00:29:14.668]  They already have hit team police on every major department, work for the feds on record.
[00:29:14.668 --> 00:29:20.690]  They can pull you over and put that needle in you and it's going to have the race-specific bioweapon already on it.
[00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.671]  Because see, now they're medicalized police.
[00:29:22.671 --> 00:29:34.455]  Now they've set the precedent to get into your body and forcibly inoculate you and take you to relocation centers and break up your family as the clergy response team and InfraGard people have been trained to do.
[00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:41.193]  I'm in a news blitz on the other side of this quick break.
[00:29:41.193 --> 00:29:42.914]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:42.914 --> 00:29:45.416]  Adam, Jack, Lenny, Karen, Tony and others.
[00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:47.117]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[00:29:47.117 --> 00:29:48.017]  You found it!
[00:29:48.017 --> 00:29:50.979]  The Front Lines!
[00:29:50.979 --> 00:29:52.360]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.902]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.902 --> 00:29:57.584]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.609 --> 00:30:03.612]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.612 --> 00:30:08.957]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:08.957 --> 00:30:10.999]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:16.004]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.004 --> 00:30:16.925]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.165 --> 00:30:18.286]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.286 --> 00:30:20.167]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.167 --> 00:30:21.248]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.248 --> 00:30:23.449]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.449 --> 00:30:24.790]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.331]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.331 --> 00:30:31.594]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.594 --> 00:30:35.177]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.177 --> 00:30:38.639]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:38.979 --> 00:30:40.220]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.120]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.220]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.161]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.161 --> 00:30:44.241]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.241 --> 00:30:47.303]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.303 --> 00:30:49.064]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.064 --> 00:30:49.984]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:06.784]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:06.784 --> 00:31:14.351]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.351 --> 00:31:20.536]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:20.936 --> 00:31:22.917]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:22.917 --> 00:31:25.417]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.417 --> 00:31:36.980]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.661]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.661 --> 00:31:40.521]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.521 --> 00:31:46.743]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.432 --> 00:31:55.698]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.698 --> 00:31:57.279]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:58.460]  The people strike back!
[00:32:00.333 --> 00:32:04.855]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:32:04.855 --> 00:32:07.437]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:32:07.437 --> 00:32:08.317]  He was devastated.
[00:32:08.317 --> 00:32:17.102]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:32:17.102 --> 00:32:23.305]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[00:32:23.305 --> 00:32:26.006]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[00:32:26.006 --> 00:32:28.387]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[00:32:29.448 --> 00:32:29.668]  I think so.
[00:32:53.701 --> 00:32:57.483]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[00:32:57.483 --> 00:33:14.452]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[00:33:14.452 --> 00:33:23.156]  Front porch sittin' In an old rockin' chair The sun is hot in the Texas sky
[00:33:23.683 --> 00:33:26.886]  This is the other type of news I have in my stack.
[00:33:26.886 --> 00:33:30.971]  Swine flu could cause as many 90,000 U.S.
[00:33:30.971 --> 00:33:31.331]  deaths.
[00:33:31.331 --> 00:33:32.472]  Remember that?
[00:33:32.472 --> 00:33:33.894]  Well, I have another headline.
[00:33:33.894 --> 00:33:43.063]  German doctor says swine flu vaccine could kill as many as 60,000 people.
[00:33:43.063 --> 00:33:44.084]  That is coming up.
[00:33:44.084 --> 00:33:45.005]  And the fact that
[00:33:45.979 --> 00:33:50.543]  Major German News is reporting that the vaccine does have live cancer virus in it.
[00:33:50.543 --> 00:33:53.265]  Alright, I'm going to take your calls, so we get to a lot of calls.
[00:33:53.265 --> 00:33:58.549]  I'm going to give each caller about a minute, no matter how important your info is, that way we get to the next person.
[00:33:58.549 --> 00:34:03.513]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[00:34:03.513 --> 00:34:04.513]  Adam in Texas.
[00:34:04.513 --> 00:34:06.455]  Adam, you're on the air.
[00:34:06.455 --> 00:34:12.920]  Yeah, Alex, I've been listening to you for a couple of years and I do value a lot of the information that you put forth.
[00:34:13.666 --> 00:34:28.794]  However, I wanted to kind of disagree with the DHS Girl Scout awareness patches that they've teamed up with to give to Girl Scouts.
[00:34:28.794 --> 00:34:40.799]  You know, my daughter's in the Girl Scout, and this patch is really just an awareness and preparedness of how to deal with natural disasters or other disasters.
[00:34:40.799 --> 00:34:41.740]  For instance, my daughter
[00:34:42.441 --> 00:34:48.105]  He's working on the Hurricane Awareness Patch, which is one of the ones that was put forth for the... No, no, I understand.
[00:34:48.105 --> 00:34:53.468]  Sir, do you know how you domesticate wild hogs?
[00:34:53.468 --> 00:34:55.029]  No, I don't.
[00:34:55.029 --> 00:34:56.210]  Well, you put out grain.
[00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:01.894]  You put a feeder out for a month with grain or little range cubelets that come out.
[00:35:01.894 --> 00:35:03.655]  That's like candy to them.
[00:35:03.655 --> 00:35:09.479]  And then you put a little fence up that has a gate around it after you've had it without a gate for a month.
[00:35:09.479 --> 00:35:10.560]  And then you put a timer
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:18.464]  on the gate after about another month to where when all the hogs are in there waiting for it to go off at 6 a.m.
[00:35:18.464 --> 00:35:36.753]  the gate swings shut and then you can pull up and either machine gun the hogs the wild hogs that are destroying your crops or you can try to herd them into a smaller pen and then haul them off and fatten them up for sale.
[00:35:38.038 --> 00:35:40.139]  Now, that's what's going on with this.
[00:35:40.139 --> 00:35:45.722]  The White House says they want national compulsory service for school children.
[00:35:45.722 --> 00:35:49.324]  Rahm Emanuel's written a book and talked about it on C-SPAN, the President has.
[00:35:49.324 --> 00:35:52.005]  They've introduced bills to do it that we've listed.
[00:35:54.346 --> 00:36:11.352]  When you hear about the patch and emergency man-made and natural disasters and, quote, helping their parents and their communities understand the importance of readiness, that's a quote from AFP and the director, the lady that directs Girl Scouts of America, that that is to acclimate them.
[00:36:11.352 --> 00:36:19.115]  Obviously the first federalization of Girl Scouts, the 3.4 million, is going to sound reasonable.
[00:36:19.115 --> 00:36:23.196]  Just like we saw what happened with
[00:36:24.511 --> 00:36:26.652]  Obama wanting to speak to the kids.
[00:36:26.652 --> 00:36:37.534]  The original speech and the original lesson plan said how you're going to help the president and you're going to write him letters about promising to help him and going under their control.
[00:36:37.534 --> 00:36:43.756]  Then once there was heat, he came out and gave a milquetoast speech and people say, you know, what's the big deal?
[00:36:43.756 --> 00:36:50.758]  So, do you know how Hitler's Hitlerjugend, Hitler youth started?
[00:36:54.225 --> 00:37:01.732]  I mean, I've read various books about how certain
[00:37:02.611 --> 00:37:10.793]  Programs were implemented to make people quote-unquote aware of certain things and I mean, but... Well, let me tell you how it started.
[00:37:10.793 --> 00:37:13.734]  Okay, this is mainline history.
[00:37:13.734 --> 00:37:23.436]  Every major documentary about the history of the Nazis will tell you that the Nazis beat the other political parties because they knew how to make it fun.
[00:37:24.488 --> 00:37:47.686]  And they created their own Boy Scouts, and they had parties, and games, and playing chess, and wrestling, and sword fights with wooden swords, and camping, and the Nazis knew how to have fun, and biking, and backpacking, and skiing, and the Nazis paid for it all, and then the first thing Hitler did in 33 when he took over is he took over the Boy Scouts of Germany.
[00:37:48.598 --> 00:37:52.819]  Boy Scouts actually started in Germany and Austria, not in the United States.
[00:37:52.819 --> 00:37:54.199]  We got it from them.
[00:37:54.199 --> 00:37:57.620]  And the Kaisers before them created it as a paramilitary training group.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.640]  Hitler took that over.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:05.481]  Our Boy Scouts were founded by the federal government as well to create a paramilitary training group.
[00:38:05.481 --> 00:38:08.962]  So, just, sir, you just don't know the history.
[00:38:08.962 --> 00:38:11.822]  I understand it's been made to look palatable.
[00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:13.803]  I know it's been made to look reasonable.
[00:38:13.803 --> 00:38:14.743]  But I'm telling you it's not.
[00:38:15.814 --> 00:38:22.258]  Well, I mean, I'm very aware of a lot of the psych-ops that have been going on.
[00:38:22.258 --> 00:38:26.301]  I've researched this stuff diligently over the past three years.
[00:38:26.301 --> 00:38:32.025]  I just, I mean, you read the document of how to achieve this patch.
[00:38:32.025 --> 00:38:34.026]  There's no tattletaling.
[00:38:34.026 --> 00:38:35.267]  There's none of that.
[00:38:35.267 --> 00:38:40.170]  It's research that's parent-based, parent-directed.
[00:38:40.868 --> 00:38:41.749]  Let me stop you again.
[00:38:41.749 --> 00:38:43.190]  Let me stop you again.
[00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:49.657]  Three years ago, I got criticized because they started the same program with the Boy Scouts of America.
[00:38:49.657 --> 00:39:03.970]  And I told everybody, I said, in the next few years, they're going to start training them because I know what the Secure Corps Division of AmeriCorps training is because I'd already seen it under Bush in the Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:05.132]  Then I got to move on with you, sir.
[00:39:06.391 --> 00:39:15.898]  Have you seen the New York Times with the Boy Scouts training with M16s to quote take on disgruntled gun-owning veterans in seek and destroy missions?
[00:39:15.898 --> 00:39:17.700]  I have and that's quite disturbing.
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:22.723]  Okay, well your daughter in three years will be training to spy on your neighbors.
[00:39:22.723 --> 00:39:23.304]  Period.
[00:39:23.304 --> 00:39:25.265]  But hey, call me back in three years when I'm right.
[00:39:25.265 --> 00:39:27.607]  Probably be too late then, but so what?
[00:39:27.607 --> 00:39:32.851]  I mean, sir, believe me, I'm not criticizing you or your daughter.
[00:39:32.851 --> 00:39:33.872]  The first time
[00:39:35.828 --> 00:39:37.588]  Do you know how a Ponzi scheme works?
[00:39:37.588 --> 00:39:45.010]  The first few people that get into the Ponzi scheme make huge returns of 20, 30, 40 percent to then con everybody else.
[00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.550]  Does a fish hook have a big juicy worm on it?
[00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:50.171]  No.
[00:39:50.171 --> 00:39:57.432]  If you're a fish, does a big juicy worm, a big nightcrawler on the end of that hook, does it look plump and delicious?
[00:39:57.432 --> 00:39:58.152]  Probably.
[00:39:58.152 --> 00:39:59.313]  I'm sure it does.
[00:39:59.313 --> 00:40:01.273]  Okay, well, I'm telling you, sir, it's bait.
[00:40:02.634 --> 00:40:03.214]  It's bait.
[00:40:03.214 --> 00:40:06.536]  Of course they're going to make the first program.
[00:40:06.536 --> 00:40:15.642]  Homeland Security and FEMA has no business involved with your daughter, sir.
[00:40:15.642 --> 00:40:17.803]  You know, to a certain extent you're right, Alex.
[00:40:17.803 --> 00:40:25.368]  I mean, you know, that combination should probably not be.
[00:40:25.368 --> 00:40:31.692]  And I do see it as kind of a, your analogy of the bait on the fish hook.
[00:40:32.409 --> 00:40:36.273]  However, if there were something behind it, I would give it more credence.
[00:40:36.273 --> 00:40:44.520]  But like I said, reading the documents, looking at what it is, you know, I live in Houston where we were hit by a hurricane last year.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.321]  No, I understand.
[00:40:45.321 --> 00:40:48.443]  It's great to teach kids values and I gotta let you go.
[00:40:48.443 --> 00:40:55.390]  You know, if you want to write an article countering us, I'd probably publish it at writersandinfowars.com.
[00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.650]  Go ahead.
[00:40:57.139 --> 00:41:04.595]  Okay, I mean, sir, they come out with something that sounds reasonable at first to acclimate you.
[00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:07.522]  So that anyone that knows history and warns people sounds like a kook.
[00:41:09.557 --> 00:41:17.258]  And then next, sir, this is how SecureCorps and AmeriCorps and Clergy Response Team and InfraGard started.
[00:41:17.258 --> 00:41:22.779]  I told you last year they were going to announce that Homeland Security was going to put troops on the streets.
[00:41:22.779 --> 00:41:25.880]  And then they said, yeah, 4,000 troops and then 20,000 and 40,000.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:31.561]  They announced 379,000 two weeks ago.
[00:41:31.561 --> 00:41:38.142]  They've got the Marines and the Army out running checkpoints, quote, looking for drunk drivers without warrants.
[00:41:38.737 --> 00:41:41.118]  Totally illegal!
[00:41:41.118 --> 00:41:42.238]  And why?
[00:41:42.238 --> 00:41:48.220]  So that when people say, hey, we don't want the Army and Marine Corps out running checkpoints, people say, well, what's wrong with that?
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.721]  They're stopping drunk drivers.
[00:41:49.721 --> 00:41:59.904]  What's wrong with my nine-year-old daughter, you know, learning and getting a relationship with FEMA and Homeland Security?
[00:41:59.904 --> 00:42:03.666]  You know, they're just helping with hurricanes.
[00:42:03.666 --> 00:42:04.426]  Oh, God help us.
[00:42:06.431 --> 00:42:08.553]  You're being acclimated.
[00:42:08.553 --> 00:42:14.839]  When Homeland Security is out, with the jaws of life, helicopters land and they start air vaccing people?
[00:42:14.839 --> 00:42:18.082]  That's for PR purposes.
[00:42:18.082 --> 00:42:20.104]  I've been to the urban warfare drills.
[00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:25.909]  They're training to take over our city halls, our county courthouses, if the locals don't go along with it.
[00:42:25.909 --> 00:42:30.934]  They're trained to go in and shoot the local police and throw hand grenades through the windows, okay?
[00:42:32.674 --> 00:42:38.737]  The troops are training to throw hand grenades in your local police station's window if they don't go along with it.
[00:42:38.737 --> 00:42:40.018]  You understand that?
[00:42:40.018 --> 00:42:50.824]  That NORTHCOM and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act states that NORTHCOM and Homeland Security are there to sweep the governors aside if they don't do what they're told?
[00:42:50.824 --> 00:42:54.466]  Do you know what's happening, buddy?
[00:42:54.466 --> 00:42:58.088]  Have you seen everything I've talked about in the past come true?
[00:42:58.088 --> 00:43:01.670]  How do people sit there and gullibly take the acclamation?
[00:43:03.922 --> 00:43:10.786]  The Marine Corps doesn't give a hoot about drunk drivers, I will assure you.
[00:43:10.786 --> 00:43:19.192]  They're there to acclimate the Marine Corps and regular Marine Corps, regular active duty, not reserves.
[00:43:19.192 --> 00:43:28.478]  Take Tennessee, regular Army with Homeland Security with the National Guard, searching everybody's cars.
[00:43:28.478 --> 00:43:30.739]  The governor says don't do it, they still do it.
[00:43:30.739 --> 00:43:32.981]  Folks, do you know what's going on around you?
[00:43:34.073 --> 00:43:38.896]  Do you understand you're being acclimated to all this stuff?
[00:43:38.896 --> 00:43:42.619]  But again, you identify your daughter as the Girl Scouts, and it's over.
[00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:44.700]  It's sick.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.242]  And, you know, the preachers have been trained.
[00:43:47.242 --> 00:43:56.349]  I told you a year and a half before it was in mainstream news, they'd train the preachers to tell their flocks to turn their guns in and go to FEMA camps, and now it's mainstream news.
[00:43:56.349 --> 00:44:02.473]  And you've got these people trained to be these little do-gooders who just totally trust government and do whatever they say.
[00:44:04.181 --> 00:44:05.382]  I said I'd take a lot of your calls.
[00:44:05.382 --> 00:44:07.123]  It's just that guy brought up a heavy-duty issue.
[00:44:07.123 --> 00:44:08.104]  Jack in Florida.
[00:44:08.104 --> 00:44:10.526]  Jack, you're on the air.
[00:44:10.526 --> 00:44:11.586]  Hello, Alex.
[00:44:11.586 --> 00:44:12.067]  Go ahead.
[00:44:12.067 --> 00:44:13.828]  Welcome.
[00:44:13.828 --> 00:44:17.831]  I believe all of it's probably just a big psyops like Operation Mockingbird.
[00:44:17.831 --> 00:44:22.234]  I mean, everything from the Girl Scouts and all of it.
[00:44:22.234 --> 00:44:27.018]  Anyway, what I'm calling about is you probably have already brought this up on your show.
[00:44:27.018 --> 00:44:27.078]  HR-1207.
[00:44:30.504 --> 00:44:38.689]  According to Ron Paul, we've got a hearing scheduled, not this Friday, but the next Friday, which is September 25th.
[00:44:38.689 --> 00:44:43.832]  Have you read up on that yet?
[00:44:43.832 --> 00:44:44.673]  What are you talking about?
[00:44:44.673 --> 00:44:48.715]  How he's having different meetings to end the Fed and different hearings in Congress?
[00:44:48.715 --> 00:44:57.721]  No, it's the House Financial Service Committee Chairman, Barney Frank, has officially agreed to... No, no, I'm saying the end of the Fed is going to have a hearing.
[00:44:59.053 --> 00:44:59.714]  Right.
[00:44:59.714 --> 00:45:00.314]  September 25th.
[00:45:00.314 --> 00:45:04.617]  I hadn't heard much about it on the radio, the shows and so forth.
[00:45:04.617 --> 00:45:06.819]  Also, anybody not taking note, it's S-604, the bill in the Senate.
[00:45:28.274 --> 00:45:30.414]  So we need to talk to other Senators.
[00:45:30.414 --> 00:45:35.575]  Something else too, Alex, is coming up that I haven't heard much about.
[00:45:35.575 --> 00:45:44.657]  It's a judge has agreed to an eligibility trial of Obama's birth certificate.
[00:45:44.657 --> 00:45:50.758]  Jerome Corsi was talking about that coming up January 26, 2010.
[00:45:50.758 --> 00:45:52.919]  So that's another important thing coming up.
[00:45:53.658 --> 00:45:54.619]  Okay, thank you.
[00:45:54.619 --> 00:46:04.145]  Right off the top of your head, I'd like to hear you go over maybe ten of the issues that's going on right now.
[00:46:04.145 --> 00:46:07.768]  I mean, just all of it seems like it's coming to a head at once.
[00:46:07.768 --> 00:46:09.209]  It is.
[00:46:09.209 --> 00:46:12.311]  Thank you so much, I appreciate your call.
[00:46:12.311 --> 00:46:17.615]  Look, the flu being used as a federal takeover cover, the forced inoculations, the
[00:46:19.386 --> 00:46:23.427]  Deaths and illnesses associated with the vaccine.
[00:46:23.427 --> 00:46:25.207]  The new Bank of the World being set up.
[00:46:25.207 --> 00:46:29.789]  Further expansion of control over banking.
[00:46:29.789 --> 00:46:35.910]  Israel talking about openly hitting Iran in the next few months.
[00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:37.791]  All these different pieces of legislation.
[00:46:37.791 --> 00:46:40.971]  Restrict free speech.
[00:46:40.971 --> 00:46:45.553]  The military openly announcing that they're doing more and more deployments inside the United States.
[00:46:45.553 --> 00:46:46.833]  Openly acclimating the public.
[00:46:48.442 --> 00:46:51.185]  Government-sponsored terror is definitely in the cards.
[00:46:51.185 --> 00:46:54.407]  They need that.
[00:46:54.407 --> 00:46:59.232]  But yes, the march to end the Fed, I talk about that every day.
[00:46:59.232 --> 00:47:01.654]  I talked about it for an hour yesterday.
[00:47:01.654 --> 00:47:05.257]  But I'm sorry, I'll try to cover that more.
[00:47:05.257 --> 00:47:07.980]  Because it is a very, very central issue.
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.322]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lenny in New York.
[00:47:10.322 --> 00:47:11.043]  Lenny, you're on the air.
[00:47:12.298 --> 00:47:19.900]  Hey, my girlfriend works at a hospital in New York and just received a nasty email notifying her that by November 30th, it is mandatory to take the swine flu vaccination.
[00:47:20.856 --> 00:47:24.698]  Yes, there's no law, but they do have the executive order.
[00:47:24.698 --> 00:47:31.861]  But you notice the president says we're not going to make you take it, but the CDC and the World Health Organization, the WHO, is really in control.
[00:47:31.861 --> 00:47:38.685]  The UN's openly calling the shots worldwide, and as they bragged a few months ago, this is a great moment for global governance.
[00:47:38.685 --> 00:47:41.506]  It's a global government takeover drill.
[00:47:41.506 --> 00:47:47.469]  They're ordering firemen, police, nurses, medical workers to take the shots in Europe,
[00:47:48.209 --> 00:47:52.453]  In England, in the United States, in Canada, I have seen those news articles.
[00:47:52.453 --> 00:47:56.697]  And then Obama gets up and lies and says, you don't have to take it.
[00:47:56.697 --> 00:48:08.809]  So... They don't want to spook the public, so we organize and say no to forced inoculation, so they just come to the public schools and say, if you want to go to school, you gotta take the flu shot.
[00:48:09.605 --> 00:48:12.627]  There's no law, and then they don't even announce it on the news.
[00:48:12.627 --> 00:48:16.350]  They just do it all by cornering your kid when nobody's there to protect them.
[00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:18.431]  Or they do it by cornering the nurses.
[00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:24.075]  But I saw a poll two months ago where 60 plus percent of New York nurses said they're not taking it.
[00:48:24.075 --> 00:48:36.103]  But again, they'll try to individually corner you, and if they ever get their bluff through and force first responders to do it, they already tried with the smallpox in 2002, then they're going to go ahead with the forced inoculation against the public.
[00:48:37.964 --> 00:48:39.364]  Well, she just got the email today.
[00:48:39.364 --> 00:48:42.865]  She was calling me a kook and a crazy for telling me the past few months that, you know,
[00:49:04.707 --> 00:49:13.197]  Could you, you had it in July, you reported this, um, that by November 30th, there's a New York State Regulation that they're gonna, you know, force you to take it.
[00:49:13.197 --> 00:49:15.019]  You're gonna lose your job, or whatever.
[00:49:16.698 --> 00:49:18.999]  Well, I mean, it's not like you had to believe us.
[00:49:18.999 --> 00:49:22.561]  It was in the New York News.
[00:49:22.561 --> 00:49:31.426]  I mean, we broke it first when we got sent an email, the internal email, by a male nurse in New York City, but it came out like a week later.
[00:49:31.426 --> 00:49:35.249]  I mean, what, I mean, she didn't believe the New York Daily News and AP?
[00:49:35.249 --> 00:49:37.450]  She thought they were Al-Qaeda or something?
[00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:42.272]  Well, at first, you know, she thought anything that was on your website was, you know, fake or whatever.
[00:49:42.272 --> 00:49:44.854]  But now that it's in her first hand, she's starting to realize it.
[00:49:47.779 --> 00:49:49.380]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:52.223]  So, is she going to roll her sleeve up and enjoy herself?
[00:49:52.223 --> 00:49:53.104]  No, no, no.
[00:49:53.104 --> 00:49:54.745]  I've told her not to.
[00:49:54.745 --> 00:50:00.370]  I told her, do you want to spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair, or do you get one chance?
[00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:04.133]  You put that needle in your arm, you die, or you, you know, end up sick.
[00:50:04.133 --> 00:50:05.034]  That's it.
[00:50:05.034 --> 00:50:07.336]  You only get one chance.
[00:50:07.336 --> 00:50:07.916]  Absolutely.
[00:50:07.916 --> 00:50:08.837]  God bless you, sir.
[00:50:08.837 --> 00:50:15.923]  You know, they're really upset that it's come out that Gardasil's killed a whole bunch of people and maimed a bunch of others and paralyzed a whole bunch of people.
[00:50:17.065 --> 00:50:20.406]  And so they're trying to make it illegal in England to talk about it.
[00:50:20.406 --> 00:50:28.028]  They shoot your kids up, they come home in wheelchairs drooling, and then if you complain, they say, listen, we'll take your other kids.
[00:50:28.028 --> 00:50:34.190]  We're here to murder your family, and if you don't like it, we'll murder you faster.
[00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.990]  See, folks, they've got a leg up on us.
[00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:41.132]  They got the jump on us because it's so outrageous what they're doing.
[00:50:41.132 --> 00:50:44.212]  It's so crazy, just like Hitler and Stalin.
[00:50:44.212 --> 00:50:46.213]  It was so crazy, people couldn't believe it was happening.
[00:50:47.233 --> 00:50:49.535]  But you study history, it happens most of the time.
[00:50:49.535 --> 00:50:57.840]  Hey look, cops, you want to roll your sleeves up and get cancer ten years down the road or get sterilized, go ahead.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.922]  I know you think I'm the enemy because I don't want you to take it.
[00:51:01.656 --> 00:51:07.040]  When it comes to emergency preparedness, you know it's the responsible thing to do for you and your family.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:12.164]  You also know that preparedness, though a necessity, can cost hundreds, even thousands of dollars.
[00:51:12.164 --> 00:51:17.368]  Unfortunately, in these tough economic times, most cannot get ready for emergency situations.
[00:51:17.368 --> 00:51:19.650]  For many, preparedness has been placed on the back burner.
[00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:19.870]  I think so.
[00:51:39.244 --> 00:51:39.624]  I think so.
[00:52:00.629 --> 00:52:07.391]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.391 --> 00:52:10.012]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.012 --> 00:52:11.572]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.572 --> 00:52:12.373]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.373 --> 00:52:13.433]  This is his M.O.s.
[00:52:13.433 --> 00:52:14.733]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.733 --> 00:52:16.734]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:16.734 --> 00:52:23.876]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:23.876 --> 00:52:24.356]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.356 --> 00:52:29.998]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.698 --> 00:52:34.219]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.219 --> 00:52:36.999]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:11.561 --> 00:53:12.921]  The answer is simple.
[00:53:12.921 --> 00:53:14.482]  PureBulk.com.
[00:53:14.482 --> 00:53:23.563]  PureBulk.com has over 150 bulk wholesale nutritional products in stock, including vitamins, super antioxidants, amino acids, and herbal extracts.
[00:53:23.563 --> 00:53:33.185]  PureBulk.com's products contain no fillers, no additives, no fancy retail packaging, and no minimum purchase, allowing you to save 50 to 90% over store-bought supplements.
[00:53:33.185 --> 00:53:38.006]  PureBulk.com carries atomic iodine, red wine extract, gingko biloba, oil of oregano,
[00:53:38.046 --> 00:53:38.266]  I think so.
[00:54:25.542 --> 00:54:36.924]  The globalists, the social engineers, know that they've got revolution on their hands, but they're experts at managing that.
[00:54:36.924 --> 00:54:43.426]  By the way, I've got four different mainstream news articles about NASA and the Air Force manipulating the weather.
[00:54:44.716 --> 00:54:47.698]  And Kim trailing us.
[00:54:47.698 --> 00:54:55.904]  Remember all those years ago, we said exactly what the Kim trails were, that it was weather modification, that it was barium salts, aluminum dioxide?
[00:54:55.904 --> 00:55:04.090]  Government laughs at us, then they come out a decade later and say exactly what we said it was, is exactly what it is.
[00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:11.595]  Yes, we're spraying you with barium salts and aluminum dioxide, we're manipulating the weather, and yes, these aluminum dioxides are hurting you.
[00:55:11.595 --> 00:55:13.216]  And if you don't like it, a SWAT team will drop by.
[00:55:14.952 --> 00:55:17.533]  It's just so funny!
[00:55:17.533 --> 00:55:26.135]  It's all so funny to have these control freak eugenicists playing God, running everything.
[00:55:26.135 --> 00:55:29.776]  I'm going to continue with your calls.
[00:55:29.776 --> 00:55:32.936]  Karen and Tony and Steve and everybody else.
[00:55:32.936 --> 00:55:34.977]  I got Paul Watson coming on for about 20 minutes.
[00:55:36.727 --> 00:55:37.608]  At the Eight After.
[00:55:37.608 --> 00:55:42.912]  To give us a report on the new fake Bin Laden tape that came out a few days ago.
[00:55:42.912 --> 00:55:44.152]  Watson's a real expert on that.
[00:55:44.152 --> 00:55:52.618]  And Charlie Sheen Live, coming up, responding to the cowardice of the mainstream media.
[00:55:52.618 --> 00:56:03.126]  They like to come out and attack him and put words in his mouth and lie about him and lie about his 20 points to the President and lie about his video to the President.
[00:56:03.126 --> 00:56:05.488]  But they won't actually respond
[00:56:07.537 --> 00:56:09.018]  To what he actually said.
[00:56:09.018 --> 00:56:14.123]  And so he challenged McCain's daughter that attacked him on The View.
[00:56:14.123 --> 00:56:18.546]  He challenged Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Pauliper Mechanics to a debate.
[00:56:18.546 --> 00:56:22.029]  On live TV.
[00:56:22.029 --> 00:56:26.833]  Larry King Live at first, you know, was talking to him and said, oh, if we can find somebody to debate you, we'll have you on.
[00:56:26.833 --> 00:56:29.956]  But they say they can find no one to debate Sheen.
[00:56:33.203 --> 00:56:33.923]  Think about that.
[00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:36.465]  Not popular mechanics, they've been contacted.
[00:56:36.465 --> 00:56:36.885]  All of them.
[00:56:36.885 --> 00:56:38.486]  They will not do it.
[00:56:38.486 --> 00:56:39.807]  They will only do it one-sided.
[00:56:39.807 --> 00:56:48.113]  Because what are they going to do when Sheen starts listing off, well, here's six of the ten commission members saying it was a criminal cover-up.
[00:56:48.113 --> 00:56:52.055]  What are they going to do when it comes out that all these former U.S.
[00:56:52.055 --> 00:56:59.260]  generals and others are on record, and former top CIA section chiefs, like Bill Christensen, saying it's a total inside job?
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:00.601]  What are they going to do?
[00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:08.663]  No, they've got to sit there with a one-sided debate and lie.
[00:57:08.663 --> 00:57:14.133]  Speaking of 9-11 truth, ladies and gentlemen, I have produced Terror Storm, the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:57:15.959 --> 00:57:17.820]  Truth Rising.
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:21.122]  These are really the definitive films on government-sponsored terror.
[00:57:21.122 --> 00:57:25.405]  You may know all about government-sponsored terrorism, but your neighbor, your friends, your family, they don't.
[00:57:25.405 --> 00:57:26.826]  But they're now ready to listen.
[00:57:26.826 --> 00:57:29.908]  People are open-minded now when they weren't five years ago.
[00:57:29.908 --> 00:57:32.389]  Get them at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:32.389 --> 00:57:36.051]  The safe, secure online video bookstore shopping cart.
[00:57:36.051 --> 00:57:39.093]  And also, it starts shipping tomorrow.
[00:57:39.093 --> 00:57:41.355]  I've been authorized to ship a few days early.
[00:57:41.995 --> 00:57:47.998]  It officially comes out on DVD, DVD release of Camp FEMA that I consulted on and I'm a big part of.
[00:57:47.998 --> 00:57:49.019]  Very well produced.
[00:57:49.019 --> 00:57:50.280]  Very factual.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:53.101]  This will wake people up about the shadow government and the FEMA camps.
[00:57:53.101 --> 00:57:56.763]  Camp FEMA by Director William Lewis.
[00:57:56.763 --> 00:57:59.064]  Available at Infowars.com.
[00:57:59.064 --> 00:58:00.765]  Discounted out of the gates.
[00:58:00.765 --> 00:58:04.527]  Order the DVD today at Infowars.com.
[00:58:04.527 --> 00:58:07.729]  And we're going to start shipping that bad boy tomorrow.
[00:58:08.905 --> 00:58:10.347]  We just got them in today.
[00:58:10.347 --> 00:58:13.212]  I've been authorized to drop the hammer.
[00:58:13.212 --> 00:58:15.696]  They don't start shipping everywhere else till the 18th.
[00:58:15.696 --> 00:58:18.220]  We start shipping on the 16th.
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.301]  Goes everywhere in the U.S.
[00:58:19.301 --> 00:58:20.663]  via UPS in three days.
[00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:22.947]  So most you'll get it before the release date.
[00:58:22.947 --> 00:58:23.868]  Or on the release date.
[00:58:25.044 --> 00:58:30.246]  888-253-3139 to get the Obama Deception.
[00:58:30.246 --> 00:58:31.166]  Why procrastinate?
[00:58:31.166 --> 00:58:32.646]  Get it to get Camp FEMA.
[00:58:32.646 --> 00:58:34.647]  You can get Obama Deception discounted with Camp FEMA.

[00:58:50.162 --> 00:58:54.406]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.406 --> 00:58:56.408]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.408 --> 00:59:04.937]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:04.937 --> 00:59:10.482]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.482 --> 00:59:12.104]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.324 --> 00:59:18.849]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:18.849 --> 00:59:29.898]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:29.898 --> 00:59:30.378]  That's right.
[00:59:30.658 --> 00:59:33.219]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:09.856]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:11.436]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.436 --> 01:00:12.997]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.997 --> 01:00:17.178]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.178 --> 01:00:21.460]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:32.544]  In an hour and a half, Charlie Sheen's coming up live to respond to all the hit pieces and with some other breaking news.
[01:00:36.206 --> 01:00:37.627]  Paul Watson joins us in the next segment.
[01:00:37.627 --> 01:00:40.728]  We're going to continue to have open phones.
[01:00:40.728 --> 01:00:51.013]  And yes, I'm going to announce tonight on the website and then live tomorrow on air we're going to play the winning video.
[01:00:51.013 --> 01:00:54.255]  First, second, third prize for the latest poster contest.
[01:00:54.255 --> 01:00:55.956]  I'm announcing it a few days late because I'm
[01:00:56.778 --> 01:01:00.601]  I'm trying to watch all the videos, and I watched a bunch last night, and there's so many.
[01:01:00.601 --> 01:01:06.606]  In fact, I would ask Kurt Nemo to just post them all in one area, because I was searching around, and I couldn't find some of the pages I found earlier.
[01:01:06.606 --> 01:01:09.128]  We've gotten so many.
[01:01:09.128 --> 01:01:16.453]  Because I just want to judge these correctly, but I want to thank everybody for the great job they've done as well.
[01:01:16.453 --> 01:01:17.694]  So that is coming up.
[01:01:17.694 --> 01:01:20.136]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[01:01:20.136 --> 01:01:20.937]  Adam in Texas.
[01:01:22.697 --> 01:01:24.118]  Oh no, that's an old list.
[01:01:24.118 --> 01:01:26.260]  Karen in Oregon, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:35.548]  Hi Alex, thank you so much for all you do and thank you for the brilliance of helping Charlie Sheen with that letter to Obama.
[01:01:35.548 --> 01:01:37.470]  That's wonderful.
[01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:39.271]  Well, I mean, that was only a small part of it.
[01:01:39.271 --> 01:01:41.953]  It was his live appearances, the video message.
[01:01:41.953 --> 01:01:45.817]  The video message is the biggest thing we've done.
[01:01:45.817 --> 01:01:47.178]  And it's working well.
[01:01:47.178 --> 01:01:50.941]  Now, I have an idea that I would like to float for you.
[01:01:51.849 --> 01:01:55.954]  They seem to just make light of us when we try and show up.
[01:01:55.954 --> 01:01:58.016]  They downplay the numbers.
[01:01:58.016 --> 01:02:00.019]  They don't pay any attention to us.
[01:02:00.019 --> 01:02:02.201]  It's a money game we keep losing.
[01:02:02.201 --> 01:02:04.684]  And I'm thinking maybe we should go about it a different way.
[01:02:05.703 --> 01:02:06.003]  Thank you.
[01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:31.796]  I mean, I think general strikes are always good to show the power of the people.
[01:02:31.796 --> 01:02:37.301]  The problem is the real economy is a very small part of the financial reality.
[01:02:37.301 --> 01:02:38.542]  The banks have created
[01:02:40.387 --> 01:02:48.309]  Thousands of times fiat currency compared to what there really is intangible property.
[01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:54.471]  And so they've studied human developments and human societies and algorithms.
[01:02:54.471 --> 01:03:00.973]  They know that we can do a strike for a few days, but we'll just come back and end up spending just as much money later.
[01:03:00.973 --> 01:03:03.054]  I'm not poo-pooing your idea.
[01:03:03.934 --> 01:03:11.017]  I'm just saying lots of different ideas, lots of different systems of resistance are important.
[01:03:11.017 --> 01:03:16.479]  But I do think it's important to more and more boycott mainstream media and just keep discrediting them.
[01:03:16.479 --> 01:03:24.022]  They had a poll out that less than 30% of Americans trust mainstream media and that Americans trust alternative media more.
[01:03:24.022 --> 01:03:27.383]  So they've already lost the people's trust.
[01:03:27.383 --> 01:03:29.444]  Well how about if we combine
[01:03:30.302 --> 01:03:45.755]  During a strike, if we buy the things that we need, because governments can't give us clean air, clean water, healthy food, or communities within which to live and thrive, or integrity, and those are really the things we need, but we can give them to ourselves.
[01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:53.642]  And if we collectively could withhold our dollars, and possibly some of us even stay home consecutively,
[01:03:54.688 --> 01:04:01.871]  And call up and let them know you've turned our descendants into debt slaves before they're even born.
[01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.832]  You're selling us out at every turn.
[01:04:03.832 --> 01:04:06.494]  You've poisoned our air and our water.
[01:04:06.494 --> 01:04:09.435]  You've taken our homes from us and our money.
[01:04:09.435 --> 01:04:10.816]  Let's stay home.
[01:04:10.816 --> 01:04:13.797]  Let's fortify ourselves within our homes.
[01:04:13.797 --> 01:04:20.260]  On the 15th, all of us, millions of us, don't you think we could have a shot at turning this without firing a shot?
[01:04:20.999 --> 01:04:22.581]  Using brains and not bullets?
[01:04:22.581 --> 01:04:24.062]  Collectively?
[01:04:24.062 --> 01:04:25.424]  Millions of us?
[01:04:25.424 --> 01:04:29.868]  Millions of us staying home?
[01:04:29.868 --> 01:04:37.596]  Well, sure, I just don't have the power, the listeners do, if they really pushed it in a few months from now, you know, to have a strike.
[01:04:37.596 --> 01:04:40.078]  We've heard a lot about trucker strikes and things.
[01:04:40.078 --> 01:04:44.242]  I just, if you look at Argentina, they had strikes for six months a year.
[01:04:45.083 --> 01:04:47.864]  But at the end of it, they were all basically poor slaves.
[01:04:47.864 --> 01:04:49.784]  They weren't first world anymore.
[01:04:49.784 --> 01:04:50.544]  It's going to take more.
[01:04:50.544 --> 01:04:53.225]  It's going to take taking over the counties, the cities, the states.
[01:04:53.225 --> 01:04:55.525]  It's going to take abolishing the Federal Reserve.
[01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:58.726]  It's going to take identifying the real enemy of humanity.
[01:04:58.726 --> 01:05:00.146]  That's the number one thing.
[01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:05.447]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.447 --> 01:05:09.988]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:09.988 --> 01:05:12.249]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.249 --> 01:05:13.569]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:13.869 --> 01:05:15.150]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:23.577]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:06:30.492 --> 01:06:30.732]  I think?
[01:07:01.038 --> 01:07:03.799]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[01:07:03.799 --> 01:07:05.060]  I've been so sick.
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.740]  Will the life change tea help me?
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.601]  Our answer is always the same.
[01:07:08.601 --> 01:07:14.723]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water and air are attacking you this very moment.

[01:07:20.606 --> 01:07:25.128]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.

[01:07:31.291 --> 01:07:35.893]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[01:07:35.893 --> 01:07:39.775]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[01:07:39.775 --> 01:07:43.658]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.

[01:08:06.184 --> 01:08:08.466]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:19.087 --> 01:08:21.648]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[01:08:21.648 --> 01:08:28.391]  We're now eight minutes into this second hour today.
[01:08:28.391 --> 01:08:36.735]  We are simulcasting the remainder of this second, third, and fourth hour at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:36.735 --> 01:08:40.317]  I want to say hi to all the viewers out there tuning in.
[01:08:40.317 --> 01:08:41.057]  Charlie Sheen!
[01:08:42.213 --> 01:08:51.480]  He's going to respond to the media hit pieces and their cowardice coming up in about an hour and 20 minutes with us today with some other big announcements.
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:51.920]  Phase 2!
[01:08:53.846 --> 01:09:04.958]  In our operation to put 9-11 Truth back on the front burner and not just let the establishment put out new fake Bin Laden tapes and not just let the establishment have more fake terror raids.
[01:09:04.958 --> 01:09:13.947]  Remember it came out that Cheney had done fake terror raids in New York, wanted to use army against US citizens to set the precedent to use the army against the general public.
[01:09:13.947 --> 01:09:16.290]  It's all about precedent setting with these lawyers.
[01:09:22.535 --> 01:09:27.326]  And we've got a lot of other key news coming up today.
[01:09:28.373 --> 01:09:33.815]  But Paul Watson wrote a story Monday concerning this latest Bin Laden tape.
[01:09:33.815 --> 01:09:36.577]  Now, others in the past have been proven to be fake.
[01:09:36.577 --> 01:09:43.379]  The Intel Center is run by Rumsfeld's former deputy, an expert in psychological operations.
[01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:49.922]  It has some other top CIA personnel working there publicly who have been involved in psychological operations as well.
[01:09:49.922 --> 01:09:52.223]  I mean, this isn't just some normal CIA person.
[01:09:52.223 --> 01:09:53.544]  This is black ops.
[01:09:53.544 --> 01:09:55.825]  They've been caught uploading Intel Center video
[01:09:57.153 --> 01:10:04.619]  With the audio before with the Intel Center logo in the same video layer as the Al Qaeda logo.
[01:10:04.619 --> 01:10:09.362]  Well supposedly Intel Center should load theirs in later unless they produced it.
[01:10:09.362 --> 01:10:12.505]  The graphics were produced at the same time.
[01:10:12.505 --> 01:10:13.866]  Laid on the video at the same time.
[01:10:15.796 --> 01:10:16.676]  Good to be back, Alex.
[01:10:42.754 --> 01:10:51.200]  Okay, break down some of the history of this, and some of the other fake tapes, and let's look at this newest tape.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:11:11.714]  Well, there's so many aspects to this, Alex, but the key thing about it, historically, is that the emergence of Bin Laden tapes, or Al Qaeda tapes, or Adam Pillman tapes, or Al Zawahiri tapes, repeatedly, and I mean in every single case, basically,
[01:11:12.785 --> 01:11:32.513]  coincide, their release coincides with watershed moments either politically in relation to Iraq, Afghanistan or the US presidential election or watershed moments in the progression of the 9-11 truth movement.
[01:11:32.513 --> 01:11:41.396]  Now on the latter, in May 2006 there was a major Zogby poll that got released that said
[01:11:42.185 --> 01:11:47.428]  Over half of Americans think that 9-11 is a cover-up.
[01:11:47.428 --> 01:12:09.419]  Days after that poll came out and 9-11 truth was pushed to the forefront of national media attention, a Bin Laden tape was released, and in that tape he reinforced the myth that he had carried out 9-11, despite the fact that in the first four video and audio tapes after 9-11,
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.400]  I think so.
[01:12:33.636 --> 01:12:44.804]  Fat Bin Laden tape came out where he supposedly took the blame for 9-11 and then in the subsequent video and audio tapes after that he took the blame as well.
[01:12:44.804 --> 01:12:59.194]  So obviously now you have Charlie Sheen last week coming out and pushing 9-11 truth back to the forefront of national public attention and lo and behold a new Bin Laden tape gets released.
[01:12:59.194 --> 01:13:02.397]  So from that perspective it does have ties to
[01:13:04.150 --> 01:13:21.494]  Progression within the 9-11 truth movement is normally followed by the establishment attempting to reinforce the official story by having Bin Laden or Al Zawahiri come out and reinforce the official story that al-Qaeda carried out the attack.
[01:13:21.494 --> 01:13:31.757]  But even more strongly is the historical track record of these videotapes coming out immediately around the time
[01:13:32.358 --> 01:13:44.667]  That either the Bush or now the Obama administration need some cover, need some support for their failing agenda both in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:13:44.667 --> 01:13:55.415]  Now the most, probably the most infamous example was right before the invasion of Iraq when Colin Powell was making his infamous presentation to the UN.
[01:13:56.607 --> 01:14:08.318]  Powell referenced the fact that an audio tape would soon be released in which Bin Laden claimed he was allied with Saddam Hussein, and that this tape would be broadcast shortly afterwards.
[01:14:08.318 --> 01:14:22.050]  Now, to anyone who has even a basic knowledge of geopolitics or religion regarding Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein will know that those two are sworn enemies, they always were, and to have an alliance would be
[01:14:23.371 --> 01:14:28.355]  Like, you know, Armandinejad and Bush having an alliance, it would be completely out of the question.
[01:14:28.355 --> 01:14:38.203]  But Powell forecasted that a tape would be released that proved a bin Laden link to Iraq, and lo and behold it was, and that was a key.
[01:14:38.203 --> 01:14:45.949]  It was a key piece of evidence that Bush cited as a reason to invade Iraq.
[01:14:45.949 --> 01:14:51.714]  Most of your readers will remember right before the 2004 election, the October surprise.
[01:14:52.372 --> 01:15:01.385]  Bin Laden appeared right on cue when Kerry was leading Bush by a few percentage points and looked like he was going to edge the election.
[01:15:01.385 --> 01:15:07.494]  Bin Laden appeared to attack Bush on October 29th and a few days later, Bush won the election.
[01:15:08.223 --> 01:15:16.827]  And later, both Bush and Kerry attributed Bush's victory to the appearance of that Bin Laden tape in late October of 2004.
[01:15:16.827 --> 01:15:27.132]  And even Walter Cronkite, the veteran news reporter, said it stank to high heaven and it looked like a Karl Rove orchestrated set-up.
[01:15:27.132 --> 01:15:36.117]  So then you've got other examples where these tapes emerge at the most politically opportune moments for the government.
[01:15:37.057 --> 01:15:57.231]  On two separate occasions for two years running, Ayman al-Zawahiri, the number two to bin Laden, so-called deputy leader of al-Qaeda, came out on the eve of the State of the Union speech in January 2006, and then again in January 2007.
[01:15:57.231 --> 01:16:04.936]  And in 2007, the big debate was about the Iraq surge, when Bush wanted to send
[01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:10.152]  100,000 more troops into Iraq and it was getting a lot of opposition.
[01:16:10.152 --> 01:16:17.977]  Right before the State of the Union, Al-Zawahiri came out and attacked the proposal saying it would never work.
[01:16:17.977 --> 01:16:23.841]  And that gave Bush, it greased the skids for him to run through the proposal.
[01:16:23.841 --> 01:16:33.147]  In fact, in that State of the Union speech in 2007, Bush cited Al-Zawahiri's videotaped speech as a reason
[01:16:33.809 --> 01:16:37.971]  That people should support the surge policy in Iraq.
[01:16:37.971 --> 01:16:50.695]  So now we fast forward to today, with this release of the supposed Bin Laden tape yesterday, and it arrives on the back of the deadliest month ever for U.S.
[01:16:50.695 --> 01:16:53.376]  forces in Afghanistan since the invasion.
[01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:55.117]  46 dead.
[01:16:55.117 --> 01:16:56.537]  46 U.S.
[01:16:56.537 --> 01:17:03.520]  troops dead in August, and September's going to rival that, which is the highest monthly toll of the entire conflict.
[01:17:04.341 --> 01:17:16.529]  It also arrives on the back of a CNN public opinion poll, as well as others, that show that, quote, opposition to the war in Afghanistan is at an all-time high.
[01:17:16.529 --> 01:17:33.600]  And this is also following up the, uh, obviously rigged election where the US puppet, Khamid Karzai, the former Unacol executive, has been returned to power on the back of his supporters setting up fake polling stations
[01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:40.633]  Uh, and, uh, creating fake ballots that returned him to, uh, power.
[01:17:40.633 --> 01:17:50.060]  So you've got this massive opposition to what's happening in Afghanistan as Obama plans to extend that war as well as the war in, uh, Pakistan.
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:57.945]  You have top generals in the UK and the, uh, US criticizing the policy in Afghanistan.
[01:17:57.945 --> 01:18:04.069]  And lo and behold, Osama bin Laden pops up again out of nowhere on this audio tape.
[01:18:04.682 --> 01:18:12.485]  And says that Barack Obama is, quote, powerless to halt the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:18:12.485 --> 01:18:25.771]  Which, as I wrote in the article, seems a pretty odd statement to make in light of the fact that Obama has only extended and aggressively beefed the campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:18:25.771 --> 01:18:28.932]  The withdrawal in Iraq was a mirage.
[01:18:30.168 --> 01:18:40.141]  He moved some troops out of the inner cities and just moved them out to the edges of the cities and as you've talked about Alex, 50,000 contractors were sent back in again.
[01:18:40.811 --> 01:18:49.540]  Okay, absolutely, and we're talking to Paul Watson about his article, CIA-linked intel center releases highly suspicious Bin Laden tape.
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:55.185]  We now have more of these fake New York raids where they admit, oh these are preemptive, we had no evidence.
[01:18:55.185 --> 01:19:00.110]  Turned out Cheney did those earlier and wanted to charge the guys under military courts
[01:19:00.771 --> 01:19:01.331]  They were U.S.
[01:19:01.331 --> 01:19:06.275]  citizens to set the precedent to use the military against the general public.
[01:19:06.275 --> 01:19:18.463]  Under Bush, and now under Obama, they've issued DHS reports listing that Homeland Security is for conservatives, gun owners, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, Anti-Federal Reserve people.
[01:19:18.463 --> 01:19:22.145]  So this whole police state is for us, not for Al Qaeda.
[01:19:22.145 --> 01:19:26.448]  Even if you believe Al Qaeda, admittedly CIA created, attacked us on 9-11.
[01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:37.141]  You can clearly see that the whole Homeland Security apparatus is being used against we the people.
[01:19:37.141 --> 01:19:44.271]  So we'll talk to Paul Watson more about that in a final segment with him on the other side of this quick break.
[01:19:46.272 --> 01:19:49.236]  And then we got Charlie Sheen coming up in about an hour and ten minutes from now.
[01:19:49.236 --> 01:19:57.508]  We're going to continue with your phone calls, get into all the big new flu developments with forced inoculations being discussed, and a lot more coming up.
[01:19:57.508 --> 01:19:58.930]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:19:58.930 --> 01:19:59.311]  Stay with us.
[01:20:01.155 --> 01:20:07.857]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:20:07.857 --> 01:20:09.518]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:20:09.518 --> 01:20:14.119]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:20:14.119 --> 01:20:21.782]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:20:21.782 --> 01:20:24.243]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[01:20:24.423 --> 01:20:26.644]  And has no dangerous second-hand smoke.
[01:20:26.644 --> 01:20:28.585]  So it's safe for the people around you.
[01:20:28.585 --> 01:20:32.907]  And will save you right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes.
[01:20:32.907 --> 01:20:36.609]  So, get rid of the ashtrays, the smell, and the smoke.

[01:21:02.851 --> 01:21:04.293]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:10.359]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:10.359 --> 01:21:11.160]  That's right.
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:14.844]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:14.844 --> 01:21:20.931]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:21.491 --> 01:21:29.619]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:29.619 --> 01:21:35.105]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:21:35.105 --> 01:21:38.128]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:40.911 --> 01:21:45.415]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:21:45.415 --> 01:21:45.695]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:45.695 --> 01:21:47.677]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:21:47.677 --> 01:21:48.018]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.018 --> 01:21:48.558]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:01.701 --> 01:22:07.726]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.726 --> 01:22:13.631]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:13.631 --> 01:22:19.777]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:20.037 --> 01:22:22.079]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:22.079 --> 01:22:24.541]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:24.541 --> 01:22:37.731]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.731 --> 01:22:39.412]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:39.412 --> 01:22:41.274]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:41.274 --> 01:22:47.499]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:22:58.015 --> 01:22:59.196]  The people strike back!
[01:23:00.991 --> 01:23:10.054]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[01:23:10.054 --> 01:23:19.978]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.

[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:26.346]  Final segment with Paul Watson, going straight to your calls and a ton of news on the other side of this break.
[01:24:26.346 --> 01:24:33.972]  Paul finishing up with the latest fake Bin Laden tape, all these fake raids.
[01:24:33.972 --> 01:24:42.158]  Clearly, they were building up to bolster the official 9-11 story before Charlie went public.
[01:24:42.158 --> 01:24:44.220]  Now they're accelerating it.
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:47.322]  They make national TV programs countering us, attacking us.
[01:24:48.637 --> 01:24:51.299]  They clearly are worried about what we're doing.
[01:24:51.299 --> 01:25:02.046]  That shows that we're affecting change and that we have a chance to stop these people or they wouldn't be spending so much time and energy going after us.
[01:25:02.046 --> 01:25:08.970]  Well, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq fundamentally rely on the official 9-11 story being true.
[01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:15.875]  It's like Webster Taupoli says, if that can be denigrated and discredited then it completely undermines the foundation of their wars.
[01:25:16.835 --> 01:25:31.579]  What's interesting about almost every Bin Laden tape is the fact that whoever has scripted it, and all the experts say that Bin Laden died in late 2001, everything since then has been scripted.
[01:25:31.579 --> 01:25:41.441]  Whoever's scripting it betrays an intricate knowledge of US political talking points that only somebody who closely followed it would know.
[01:25:41.441 --> 01:25:45.682]  Remember back in 2000, I think it was a London Independent reporter,
[01:25:46.423 --> 01:26:10.051]  Went out and met Bin Laden and was flabbergasted about how Bin Laden was completely cut off from society and that he didn't know anything about even major news that was breaking at the time and he accepted newspapers from the reporter like it was gold or something because he was so keen to catch up on the news because he was completely cut off from it.
[01:26:10.051 --> 01:26:15.673]  These tapes betray a knowledge, a deep knowledge of political talking points which is why
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:25.423]  The rhetoric contained in them is similar to the same rhetoric that we put out and the opponents of Obama put out.
[01:26:25.423 --> 01:26:30.605]  They're ascribing our criticism of Obama to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:26:31.559 --> 01:26:35.720]  As a means of discrediting it in the overall picture.
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:36.581]  Absolutely!
[01:26:36.581 --> 01:26:42.903]  Good propaganda has to sound reasonable too, or the public is not going to buy into the bait.
[01:26:42.903 --> 01:26:46.084]  It has to sound like it's a real critique.
[01:26:46.084 --> 01:26:52.986]  So these are legitimate critiques, but it's coming from Al-Syedah Bin Laden, and so now it's discredited.
[01:26:52.986 --> 01:26:56.287]  On another subject, Glenn Beck.
[01:26:57.990 --> 01:27:02.112]  Clearly came out and said we had to have the banker bailout and it was good.
[01:27:02.112 --> 01:27:03.472]  He supported the Patriot Act.
[01:27:03.472 --> 01:27:07.213]  He said Ron Paul was a dangerous piece of crap.
[01:27:07.213 --> 01:27:11.675]  As soon as Ron Paul lost the election, suddenly he was his best friend.
[01:27:11.675 --> 01:27:13.696]  Glenn Beck has clearly been positioned
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:26.023]  To manage and be loyal opposition for the establishment, controlling the libertarian-slash-conservative backlash to Obama.
[01:27:26.023 --> 01:27:28.123]  And I get all these mean emails and calls.
[01:27:28.123 --> 01:27:40.046]  I can't believe how ignorant... In fact, I was reading some of the comments on PrisonPlanet.com on my open letter to Beck that just went up a few minutes ago, that we're asking folks to put out, and they were saying, oh, Alex must work for ACORN.
[01:27:40.666 --> 01:27:40.806]  Well,
[01:28:09.073 --> 01:28:33.264]  It doesn't look like they can understand that because they don't have the attention span to watch a 3 minute 20 second YouTube video where Beck, when he was on CNN, is saying that he supports the bailout and then later when he's on Fox News, you know, every day he's attacking the bailout just because when he supported it, Bush was in office and now Obama's in office.
[01:28:33.686 --> 01:28:47.719]  Now, he's counting on people not having long attention spans, and I'm going after Beck in a nice way to try to just point out to his followers that he will betray them so that they'll notice while he's doing it.
[01:28:47.719 --> 01:28:49.561]  I mean, he does it right out in the open.
[01:28:49.561 --> 01:28:51.343]  This is painful, Paul.
[01:28:51.343 --> 01:28:58.810]  I mean, I'm committed to defeating the globalist takedown of the Western world, and I just wish Beck wasn't a traitor.
[01:29:00.971 --> 01:29:15.065]  Well, how can he be, quote, a libertarian at heart when he vehemently supported the USA Patriot Act and he supported the wars of aggression launched under Bush and continued by Obama?
[01:29:15.065 --> 01:29:21.611]  Those political opinions are not subscribed to by the vast, vast majority of libertarians.
[01:29:21.611 --> 01:29:23.593]  So he's leading people astray.
[01:29:23.593 --> 01:29:24.254]  And anyone that
[01:29:24.895 --> 01:29:31.819]  You can watch that GQ video where he stages the crane on demand and doesn't think he's a phony after that.
[01:29:31.819 --> 01:29:33.400]  He's just completely deluded.
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:33.880]  Stay there.
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:36.681]  Let's do five more minutes on Beck, then I'm going to the phone calls.
[01:29:36.681 --> 01:29:38.923]  Charlie Sheen coming up live in the next hour.
[01:29:38.923 --> 01:29:39.823]  This is GCN.
[01:29:39.823 --> 01:29:51.349]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.349 --> 01:29:52.730]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.730 --> 01:29:54.231]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:30:01.061]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.061 --> 01:30:04.082]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.082 --> 01:30:09.403]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.403 --> 01:30:11.464]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.464 --> 01:30:16.465]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.465 --> 01:30:17.385]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.625 --> 01:30:18.766]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.766 --> 01:30:20.649]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.649 --> 01:30:21.710]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.710 --> 01:30:23.912]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:23.912 --> 01:30:25.254]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.254 --> 01:30:26.796]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.796 --> 01:30:32.062]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.062 --> 01:30:35.206]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.626 --> 01:30:39.447]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.447 --> 01:30:40.668]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:41.588]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.588 --> 01:30:42.688]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.688 --> 01:30:43.608]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.608 --> 01:30:44.709]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:47.750]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:31:00.069 --> 01:31:05.376]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.376 --> 01:31:09.922]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:09.922 --> 01:31:12.185]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.185 --> 01:31:13.807]  You don't have to cooperate.

[01:32:00.444 --> 01:32:02.025]  Are you constantly tired?
[01:32:02.025 --> 01:32:03.865]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[01:32:03.865 --> 01:32:07.166]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[01:32:07.166 --> 01:32:10.187]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[01:32:10.187 --> 01:32:16.829]  Liquid Zeolite, available only at RestoreYourHealthNow.com, captures toxins and physically carries them out of your body.

[01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:29.713]  Studies show that Liquid Zeolite captures triggering antigens, which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma, decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[01:32:29.753 --> 01:32:30.033]  Yes.
[01:32:30.033 --> 01:32:38.497]  Liquid Zeolite is a tasteless and odorless liquid that when taken daily supports a healthy, happy and active lifestyle in an increasingly toxic world.
[01:32:38.497 --> 01:32:41.778]  And Liquid Zeolite is so gentle that you won't even know you're taking it.

[01:33:11.988 --> 01:33:33.216]  Before I get back into Glenn Beckham open letter and video to him, Paul, what about this Kyan West guy at some video awards getting up as a stunt, grabbing the microphone away insanely, I guess just in his hatred of the lady who was on stage.
[01:33:33.216 --> 01:33:39.279]  Obama responds to that, but Charlie Sheen says, I want to meet with you with 9-11 first responders and
[01:33:40.967 --> 01:33:41.908]  Well, that's right.
[01:33:41.908 --> 01:33:46.030]  I mean, this was reported this morning that an ABC News report was talking to Obama, and he had
[01:34:05.276 --> 01:34:22.221]  You know, the White House claims he's too busy to even acknowledge Sheen's letter, never mind meet with Sheen, but obviously he's not too busy to talk about some mindless antics of this hip-hop star jumping on stage at an MTV Music Awards show.
[01:34:24.747 --> 01:34:25.488]  Well, the silence
[01:34:49.227 --> 01:34:51.688]  Really illustrates how they're afraid of the facts.
[01:34:51.688 --> 01:35:00.491]  They just gotta have their Fox News and ABC News pundits and John McCain's daughter come out and name-call.
[01:35:00.491 --> 01:35:12.496]  And remember John McCain in Popular Mechanics, in that totally debunked joke of a research book, wrote the foreword attacking me!
[01:35:12.496 --> 01:35:13.096]  My name!
[01:35:14.104 --> 01:35:16.346]  I mean they attacked me in the first page of the book.
[01:35:16.346 --> 01:35:20.049]  I have the Senator John McCain attacking me.
[01:35:20.049 --> 01:35:25.554]  That shows they're concerned about what we're doing and they will not debate Charlie Sheen.
[01:35:25.554 --> 01:35:28.116]  They can't debate Charlie Sheen.
[01:35:28.116 --> 01:35:31.739]  Because six of the ten commission members agree with Charlie Sheen.
[01:35:33.499 --> 01:35:38.540]  Well, they're scared to death of the power of the 20 questions that are outlined in his letter.
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:50.322]  And that's proven by the fact that hundreds of these hit pieces which came out, mainly the ones over the last few days, completely invent things that Sheen was supposed to have said.
[01:35:50.322 --> 01:35:56.843]  They put words in his mouth so they can politicize, polarize, and make the issue partisan.
[01:35:56.843 --> 01:36:00.504]  They claim that Sheen said Bush planned 9-11.
[01:36:00.504 --> 01:36:02.764]  And, as everyone knows, you know, Bush couldn't
[01:36:03.582 --> 01:36:04.142]  Right, and I mean...
[01:36:28.050 --> 01:36:38.235]  O'Reilly, Hannity, McCain's daughter, none of them have even responded to Cheen's challenge to debate them on Larry King Live.
[01:36:38.235 --> 01:36:40.596]  They haven't even responded to it.
[01:36:40.596 --> 01:36:51.401]  So that just shows that they're afraid of the power of those 20 questions that are outlined in Cheen's letter, backed up by that bibliography.
[01:36:51.401 --> 01:36:52.442]  Absolutely, Paul.
[01:36:52.442 --> 01:36:56.884]  Okay, in closing, Glenn Beck, do you agree with me, and I want your honest response to this,
[01:36:58.362 --> 01:37:02.565]  I don't spend my time bashing Limbaugh.
[01:37:02.565 --> 01:37:08.550]  I don't spend my time bashing people I disagree with who I think are phony conservatives.
[01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:15.675]  I tried to explain that Bush was just a puppet and that they would bring in a left-wing savior and then he would sell everybody out.
[01:37:15.675 --> 01:37:19.678]  But Glenn Beck is particularly disingenuous.
[01:37:19.678 --> 01:37:26.103]  Limbaugh did not support the banker takeover bill, the banker bailout.
[01:37:28.362 --> 01:37:31.806]  Michael Savage, Sean Hannity didn't support that.
[01:37:31.806 --> 01:37:35.451]  Beck made more trips than any other talk show host to meet privately with Bush.
[01:37:35.451 --> 01:37:36.112]  That's on record.
[01:37:36.112 --> 01:37:37.253]  He brags about it.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:38:05.586]  Beck, when Ron Paul had a chance to win, he came out and really killed the campaign and said, this guy's dangerous, his people talk about bombs, he twisted the thing about money bombs, he still bad mouths him on radio, he's very two-faced, is what I don't like about Beck, and now, they have put him as the leader of the resistance to Obama, controlled opposition, so in three to four years, when they put a Republican in, there won't be real revolution, and
[01:38:07.699 --> 01:38:10.741]  So Beck can steer everybody.
[01:38:10.741 --> 01:38:29.410]  He just really is a key person for the New World Order, because if we could have a real peaceful revolution of ideas, a real move to audit the Fed, to end the Fed, which Beck, by the way, isn't calling for, that I've seen, he supports the Federal Reserve and says they're great.
[01:38:29.410 --> 01:38:31.230]  And then bad mouths them at the same time.
[01:38:31.230 --> 01:38:36.173]  I mean, can't people see Beck is there to co-opt and control things?
[01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:44.538]  Paul?
[01:38:44.538 --> 01:38:48.241]  We lost Paul's connection in England.
[01:38:48.241 --> 01:38:49.522]  That happens sometimes.
[01:38:49.522 --> 01:38:56.188]  Let's get him back on, because I want to get Paul Watson's take.
[01:38:56.188 --> 01:39:02.674]  We couldn't even contact England on our studio lines in Texas today, so we used the Genesis lines in Minnesota.
[01:39:03.547 --> 01:39:13.256]  Maybe some phone things going on between the United States and the UK over in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean across the pond there.
[01:39:13.256 --> 01:39:20.062]  But that's why I'm trying to be friendly about this.
[01:39:20.062 --> 01:39:21.483]  And I have no illusions.
[01:39:21.483 --> 01:39:22.604]  I know Beck's an operative.
[01:39:22.604 --> 01:39:23.545]  I know he's not going to listen.
[01:39:24.454 --> 01:39:32.819]  But at least I'm going to be on record now pointing out he was for the Banker Bailout and the Patriot Act and demonized Ron Paul supporters and said use the U.S.
[01:39:32.819 --> 01:39:34.340]  Army on us.
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:47.227]  And yesterday I was watching him, we had Fox News on in the break room, and Glenn Beck was saying, our republic is falling, it's on its last legs, save it!
[01:39:47.227 --> 01:39:49.649]  This is all of our terminology.
[01:39:51.584 --> 01:40:03.151]  And many people pointed out Beck has changed much of what he says to mimicking what we do here, which would be flattering if it wasn't so creepy.
[01:40:03.151 --> 01:40:05.893]  All I want is freedom and the Republic saved.
[01:40:05.893 --> 01:40:07.854]  And I'm telling you, Glenn Beck is a Trojan horse.
[01:40:07.854 --> 01:40:09.775]  Glenn Beck is a Benedict Arnold.
[01:40:09.775 --> 01:40:17.820]  Paul Watson, do you agree with me about Glenn Beck and about having to stand up against him and point out that this guy is completely two-faced?
[01:40:19.591 --> 01:40:30.123]  Well, Beck is there to sucker the grassroots conservative in and make them believe that they can fix everything by voting in a Republican in 2012.
[01:40:30.123 --> 01:40:39.894]  I mean, Beck is the equivalent of what people like Alderman and all those MSNBC anchors were before Obama got in.
[01:40:39.894 --> 01:40:40.975]  You know, they put it out that
[01:40:41.505 --> 01:40:45.228]  We could get the change we deserve by voting in Obama.
[01:40:45.228 --> 01:40:48.030]  Everybody went out and did that, and look what we've got.
[01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:56.978]  We've got the exact same policies, and in fact an aggressive expansion of those policies, both with the wars and the financial bailout.
[01:40:56.978 --> 01:41:08.307]  So it's about making people... Veiling the fact that the only way to change the system is to reject the two-party monopoly, but Beck is hooked into that, and I mean, for years,
[01:41:09.557 --> 01:41:18.082]  Before he even was on television, we would talk about Beck and post articles on the website about how he was a virulent neocon.
[01:41:18.082 --> 01:41:19.762]  And he always has been.
[01:41:19.762 --> 01:41:28.207]  And now he poses as this libertarian when his every political stance is the exact opposite of what a true libertarian would embrace.
[01:41:28.578 --> 01:41:48.072]  Well, Paul, I know him so well, I was able to successfully predict how he would debunk FEMA camps when there's bills introduced to set them up, they're already set up, Houston Chronicle, New York Times, Civilian Inmate Labor Camp, we emailed it, we mailed it to him, and I knew what he was gonna do.
[01:41:48.072 --> 01:41:53.716]  I mean, this guy, this guy is so evil.
[01:41:54.795 --> 01:41:58.436]  I mean, he's so obviously a fake and a two-face.
[01:41:58.436 --> 01:42:02.198]  I mean, again, Limbaugh wouldn't even support the banker bailout.
[01:42:02.198 --> 01:42:06.179]  He's far worse than Limbaugh.
[01:42:06.179 --> 01:42:10.961]  Well, they're kind of lining him up, as you've said, as the new Limbaugh, aren't they?
[01:42:10.961 --> 01:42:14.142]  Well, I mean, there's already signs that he's falling from grace.
[01:42:14.142 --> 01:42:19.744]  I mean, apparently he's lost half of his advertisers in the past couple of months.
[01:42:22.085 --> 01:42:31.509]  I mean, maybe people are starting to wake up from him, but obviously some of that's come from the fake left-wing assault on him, which is just about crushing freedom of speech.
[01:42:31.509 --> 01:42:34.071]  So it's kind of a pincer movement that we're caught in.
[01:42:34.071 --> 01:42:36.572]  We have to defend him when he's under attack.
[01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:41.815]  By people who just hate him because he has different political opinions to them.
[01:42:41.815 --> 01:42:43.396]  Well again, he's meant to polarize.
[01:42:43.396 --> 01:43:02.613]  He's meant to make it a Republican Democrat Fox News MSNBC bipolar system so that people really get invested in supporting Republicans and then they're going to have the victory in 2010 and the victory in 2012 and then all the FEMA camps are built, the police state's built
[01:43:03.354 --> 01:43:17.203]  The Republican that comes in will just expand it all and then we'll be called Communist Al Qaeda again because we're not supporting the right-wing version of the New World Order instead of being called right-wing fascist by the controlled left.
[01:43:17.203 --> 01:43:23.808]  It's so elementary and it just fools the public and that's why the public's losing their standard of living.
[01:43:23.808 --> 01:43:30.032]  That's why foreign banks are raping you in a big way for tens of trillions of dollars in the last few months.
[01:43:31.141 --> 01:43:43.265]  And Paul, I mean, the good news is that a larger and larger portion of people are getting that both parties are controlled, are understanding the bait and switch, and I don't think this is going to work much longer.
[01:43:43.265 --> 01:43:49.508]  I mean, they pulled a rabbit out of their hat with Obama and the same people that run Obama.
[01:43:50.248 --> 01:43:52.630]  Wall Street are the same ones that run Beck.
[01:43:52.630 --> 01:43:59.354]  Beck and Obama are really twins in this thespian theatrical Shakespearean event.
[01:43:59.354 --> 01:44:03.797]  And there's not many more rabbits they can pull out of a hat.
[01:44:03.797 --> 01:44:05.158]  Time is running out.
[01:44:05.158 --> 01:44:12.223]  People aren't sophisticated enough to know exactly what's happening, but they know they're being lied to.
[01:44:12.223 --> 01:44:18.367]  Well, the fact is that trusting government and corporate media is at an all-time low.
[01:44:19.281 --> 01:44:26.755]  I mean, the figures are that 29% trust the mainstream media, which even that seems like a high number.
[01:44:26.755 --> 01:44:31.785]  But the fallout from that is the responses for authorities to claim that
[01:44:32.358 --> 01:44:43.186]  You know, quote, conspiracy thinking has infected all areas of society, which produces things like the Psychology Today hit piece that we featured a couple of years ago.
[01:44:43.186 --> 01:44:44.967]  It's not conspiracy thinking.
[01:44:44.967 --> 01:44:51.072]  It's not some virus of mindless thinking that everything's a conspiracy that's infected society.
[01:44:51.072 --> 01:45:01.780]  It's just the fallout from the fact that government and media have lied to us so consistently and so brazenly for the past decade, you know, in our face, basically.
[01:45:02.765 --> 01:45:06.086]  That people are going to lose trust in everything.
[01:45:06.086 --> 01:45:08.286]  And that, by the way, is a problem.
[01:45:08.286 --> 01:45:10.766]  It's good to question.
[01:45:10.766 --> 01:45:22.648]  But the system has lied so much, and been caught staging terror attacks, and been caught engaged in every form of corruption, and CPS Nationwide openly run, almost in every case, by pedophiles.
[01:45:22.648 --> 01:45:29.450]  I mean, they're openly admitting they're drugging our water and poisoning us in the White House Science Czar's own textbook.
[01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:31.010]  It's all so real
[01:45:32.116 --> 01:45:32.516]  Well, yeah.
[01:46:02.324 --> 01:46:05.885]  I mean there's two ways that that can fall.
[01:46:05.885 --> 01:46:11.746]  The way that it's going at the moment is that people have no trust in any authority whatsoever.
[01:46:11.746 --> 01:46:28.089]  So they're kind of just falling back on the celebrity mindlessness and the little obsessions that they have in their own personal lives and they're just focusing on what they can personally control and then trying to ignore what's going on in the world.
[01:46:28.089 --> 01:46:30.670]  I mean that's what's happening at the moment from what I can see.
[01:46:31.266 --> 01:46:39.548]  Well, I mean, the other end of it is if people lose that much trust in any authority whatsoever, then you're just going to get anarchy in the end.
[01:46:39.548 --> 01:46:48.210]  And like you said, that may be what they want to reinforce the command and control position once people have lost all trust.
[01:46:48.210 --> 01:46:57.393]  Because if things turn really bad and you have an economic collapse, then from anarchy they can seize control once again.
[01:46:57.393 --> 01:46:58.933]  But at the moment, it seems that
[01:46:59.744 --> 01:47:10.254]  People are either really clued into this and really know what's going on, or they're just falling back on their own little personal obsessions and going that way.
[01:47:10.254 --> 01:47:14.918]  So there's a real chasm as far as that's concerned.
[01:47:14.918 --> 01:47:16.600]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:23.746]  Paul Watson will continue to track all the great reports at PrisonPlanet.com, reposted at InfoWars.com.
[01:47:23.746 --> 01:47:24.427]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:47:26.499 --> 01:47:27.540]  You bet.
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:35.824]  I want to go to Ryan, Steve, Bic, Thomas, and Annalisa, I believe is how you pronounce that, in San Fran.
[01:47:35.824 --> 01:47:38.125]  Ryan in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:47:38.125 --> 01:47:39.325]  Hey, what's up, man?
[01:47:39.325 --> 01:47:41.326]  Good, sir, go ahead.
[01:47:41.326 --> 01:47:45.488]  I have a lot of insight into a lot of things I wanted to share with people.
[01:47:45.488 --> 01:47:50.451]  And there's so much on my mind I want to talk about.
[01:47:50.451 --> 01:47:55.113]  This gut-filled... I didn't even know this homo was named until the other day.
[01:47:55.902 --> 01:48:04.269]  You know, this Fox News guy who wrote the article on Gutfield, or on Sheen, you post on your website.
[01:48:04.269 --> 01:48:06.471]  Oh, the red-eyed little weasel.
[01:48:06.471 --> 01:48:12.096]  I mean, how could you say you believe in any god at all to write something like that?
[01:48:12.096 --> 01:48:16.740]  I mean, that was one of the most despicable things that I read a lot, you know, and that is one of the most
[01:48:18.161 --> 01:48:21.343]  In any human thing that I have ever read in my entire life.
[01:48:21.343 --> 01:48:23.784]  No, it was meant to be nasty.
[01:48:23.784 --> 01:48:26.365]  It was meant to be hurtful.
[01:48:26.365 --> 01:48:35.250]  It was meant to say if you don't submit to us, we are going to destroy you.
[01:48:35.250 --> 01:48:36.751]  But it doesn't work anymore.
[01:48:36.751 --> 01:48:38.211]  Go ahead.
[01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:41.373]  What really gets me, you know, people who are uninformed about the Illuminati,
[01:48:42.051 --> 01:48:49.953]  And people who don't have any sort of actual insight into Illuminati, you know, they're hearing all this back and forth, but they really don't know, you know, a lot of different things.
[01:48:49.953 --> 01:49:00.014]  And even I saw this article yesterday that just blew my mind that, you know, they had the Professor Langdon from, you know, the Da Vinci Code movies.
[01:49:00.014 --> 01:49:03.095]  They were kind of saying, you know what, there is no actual Professor Langdon down there.
[01:49:03.095 --> 01:49:07.556]  There's no one to really study symbolism and, you know, that's just a moot.
[01:49:07.556 --> 01:49:08.236]  Are you serious?
[01:49:09.039 --> 01:49:09.840]  Are you serious?
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:11.381]  There's no one who studies symbolism.
[01:49:11.381 --> 01:49:13.723]  Let me tell you something about symbolism.
[01:49:13.723 --> 01:49:16.025]  The triangle.
[01:49:16.025 --> 01:49:21.469]  You tell me what a sphere and a triangle inside above the FEMA logo means.
[01:49:21.469 --> 01:49:26.093]  The triangle is the biggest sign the Illuminati have.
[01:49:26.093 --> 01:49:27.294]  Are you serious?
[01:49:27.294 --> 01:49:28.675]  Look at that as an artist, okay?
[01:49:28.675 --> 01:49:30.557]  If FEMA came to you and said, you know what?
[01:49:30.557 --> 01:49:32.018]  We need a logo.
[01:49:32.018 --> 01:49:36.762]  What's the purpose of a triangle in the middle of a sphere above this symbol?
[01:49:37.395 --> 01:49:40.536]  It's saying FEMA protects the New World Order.
[01:49:40.536 --> 01:49:49.538]  The circle is a sphere of protection around the New World Order, command and control, hierarchical system.
[01:49:49.538 --> 01:49:53.379]  You have to understand that these people, these people worship Satan.
[01:49:53.379 --> 01:49:53.779]  Okay?
[01:49:53.779 --> 01:49:55.640]  Satan is their god.
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:59.481]  They have to pretend, you know, to be, to love Christ.
[01:49:59.481 --> 01:50:05.182]  That's why every politician is so, you know, they're Christian, they're going to church, blah blah blah blah blah.
[01:50:05.782 --> 01:50:09.406]  You know, because they have to appear that way, because you said, you know what, I worship Satan.
[01:50:09.406 --> 01:50:14.691]  Well, you know, history has already proven that there'll be enough people to come around and kill you.
[01:50:14.691 --> 01:50:19.675]  You know, that's just how it is, but... Well, the word occult means hidden.
[01:50:20.885 --> 01:50:27.429]  And the elites operate through secret societies, through intelligence agencies, through shadow government.
[01:50:27.429 --> 01:50:29.711]  They do their business in the dark.
[01:50:29.711 --> 01:50:38.077]  And more than that, the symbol of the pyramid means the hierarchical government, where those at the top have the knowledge, those below don't.
[01:50:38.077 --> 01:50:43.760]  And so through the mysteries, through understanding how societies operate, the priest class
[01:50:45.071 --> 01:50:47.714]  Has total control over society.
[01:50:47.714 --> 01:50:50.237]  The priest class are actually Luciferians.
[01:50:50.237 --> 01:50:53.621]  They have Satanists and other sadistic people that serve them.
[01:50:53.621 --> 01:50:56.144]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:50:56.144 --> 01:50:56.805]  Please stay with us.
[01:51:02.344 --> 01:51:12.248]  Are you suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeats, clogged arteries?
[01:51:12.248 --> 01:51:14.309]  If so, you are not alone.
[01:51:14.309 --> 01:51:17.911]  Millions of people are suffering from one or more of these problems.
[01:51:17.911 --> 01:51:31.057]  If you'd like to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy, and youthfulness, and experience your body healing itself, then this might be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:51:31.377 --> 01:51:32.218]  We're good to go.
[01:52:01.497 --> 01:52:07.222]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:52:07.222 --> 01:52:08.543]  And we knew what to do.
[01:52:08.543 --> 01:52:10.545]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:52:10.545 --> 01:52:17.591]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:52:17.591 --> 01:52:26.098]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:52:26.482 --> 01:52:33.566]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:52:33.566 --> 01:52:36.748]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:36.748 --> 01:52:42.511]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:52:42.511 --> 01:52:45.093]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:54:26.459 --> 01:54:28.400]  We're going to continue with your phone calls.
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:30.582]  Charlie Sheen is coming up in about 30 minutes.
[01:54:30.582 --> 01:54:33.083]  I was just talking to him on the phone.
[01:54:33.083 --> 01:54:37.326]  Wild stuff going on behind the scenes.
[01:54:37.326 --> 01:54:46.211]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up, though, just for a few minutes, because gold is at $1,003 right now.
[01:54:46.211 --> 01:54:49.353]  And the dollar has been going up and down.
[01:54:49.353 --> 01:54:53.536]  The banks are now putting tens of trillions on the streets as they buy up assets.
[01:54:54.825 --> 01:54:54.985]  I think?
[01:55:15.336 --> 01:55:17.817]  The smart money is in gold and silver.
[01:55:17.817 --> 01:55:20.158]  The smart money is getting out of the paper.
[01:55:20.158 --> 01:55:23.820]  I told you to get into gold five, six years ago and it was 300 bucks an ounce.
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:25.081]  Now it's above 3,000.
[01:55:25.081 --> 01:55:31.824]  And all I know is it's one of the only smart investments where you can actually hold on to what you have.
[01:55:31.824 --> 01:55:36.506]  I believe in physically holding metals, physically holding silver and gold in your hands.
[01:55:36.506 --> 01:55:38.267]  Ted Anderson, tell us the latest developments.
[01:55:38.607 --> 01:55:43.691]  Well, sure, I'll just correct you on the spot price of gold right now, and it's at $1,009.10.
[01:55:43.691 --> 01:55:46.213]  Oh, excuse me, it was $103 an hour ago.
[01:55:46.213 --> 01:55:48.395]  $1,003, you're right about that.
[01:55:48.395 --> 01:55:51.218]  And anyways, yeah, the markets are going nuts right now.
[01:55:51.218 --> 01:55:55.581]  I mean, obviously, like we talked about yesterday, the prices are going to be going up.
[01:55:55.581 --> 01:55:58.043]  They did on the franc and the British sovereign.
[01:55:58.043 --> 01:56:01.006]  There are just one or two things left that haven't increased yet.
[01:56:01.006 --> 01:56:03.868]  One is that walking liberty half at $8.69.
[01:56:05.427 --> 01:56:05.947]  I don't think so.
[01:56:22.665 --> 01:56:27.588]  I'm going to have to put disclaimers on the front of their website saying they can't deliver right now.
[01:56:27.588 --> 01:56:32.371]  I mean, Barrick had to default on their futures contracts because they sold too much gold.
[01:56:32.371 --> 01:56:43.979]  So the gold and silver is running out, but you're saying the deal from a month ago, or three weeks ago, where it's at $9.45, you're saying you're at the very end, you've sold out of most of it.
[01:56:43.979 --> 01:56:50.243]  What coins do you have left when the gold market was $55 or more, dollars less?
[01:56:50.629 --> 01:57:01.423]  Well, the coins that reflect those prices right now are going to be the $10 Liberty, which is at $8.18.50, and the Walking Liberty Half, which is at $8.69.
[01:57:01.423 --> 01:57:07.110]  Both of those coins right now are the same coins that I priced, I mean the same quote,
[01:57:07.450 --> 01:57:14.632]  That I said three weeks ago, when gold was down at that $9.45 level, and we're just coming up off of $9.11.
[01:57:14.632 --> 01:57:17.913]  There is definitely a strong market going on right now.
[01:57:17.913 --> 01:57:20.554]  That stuff will go up in price too.
[01:57:20.554 --> 01:57:23.855]  All I can say, Alex, is that people should be taking heed right now.
[01:57:23.855 --> 01:57:27.236]  Plus, also, I was looking at Stiglitz right now, his article from yesterday.
[01:57:27.236 --> 01:57:35.699]  He's talking about the banks having a major problem, much larger than it was a couple years ago, when Paulson was trying to bail out the banks.
[01:57:35.979 --> 01:57:38.220]  In fact, Ted, we're going to break in one minute.
[01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:38.800]  Come back.
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:40.461]  I'm going to give you the floor for five minutes.
[01:57:40.461 --> 01:57:47.303]  I want to sit back, because you've been doing this 30 years, and you are an expert in your own right, the caliber of Chapman.
[01:57:47.303 --> 01:57:54.846]  I mean, you've really got good insights on what Stiglitz is saying, other economists saying we may have a dollar death like Argentina.
[01:57:54.846 --> 01:57:56.087]  Forbes is saying that.
[01:57:56.087 --> 01:57:58.348]  I hope that isn't the case, but regardless,
[01:58:00.049 --> 01:58:00.529]  945, now 1009.
[01:58:00.529 --> 01:58:06.111]  That's $64 more gold prices.
[01:58:06.111 --> 01:58:08.752]  You're doing this at a deal nobody can do.
[01:58:08.752 --> 01:58:12.114]  You've got silver at the price when it was a couple bucks less.
[01:58:12.114 --> 01:58:13.274]  That's below spot.
[01:58:13.274 --> 01:58:14.115]  Almost gone.
[01:58:14.115 --> 01:58:14.175]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:14.175 --> 01:58:14.215]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:24.099 --> 01:58:25.660]  And I hope you'll call the brokers.
[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:27.261]  Ted, how long can you hold that deal?
[01:58:27.261 --> 01:58:28.982]  I mean, you keep extending it.
[01:58:28.982 --> 01:58:29.442]  Yeah, I know.
[01:58:29.442 --> 01:58:35.306]  Well, I couldn't extend the British Sovereigns or the Franks, so right now we're going to hold this deal until midnight tonight.
[01:58:35.306 --> 01:58:37.727]  Oh, so this is the only deal, so you've run out of those.
[01:58:37.727 --> 01:58:42.730]  Okay, explain it to me when we get back.
[01:58:42.730 --> 01:58:45.332]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.332 --> 01:58:48.574]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:54.881]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.881 --> 01:58:56.881]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.881 --> 01:59:05.403]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.403 --> 01:59:10.945]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:10.945 --> 01:59:12.565]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.805 --> 01:59:19.328]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.328 --> 01:59:30.372]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.372 --> 01:59:30.852]  That's right.
[01:59:31.132 --> 01:59:33.714]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[01:59:53.787 --> 01:59:56.169]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.169 --> 01:59:58.931]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.396 --> 02:00:10.197]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.197 --> 02:00:11.798]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.798 --> 02:00:12.718]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.718 --> 02:00:17.540]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:23.782]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.782 --> 02:00:28.303]  Charlie Sheen coming up in T-minus 30 minutes live with huge developments.
[02:00:29.724 --> 02:00:40.895]  Ted Anderson, I want you to sit back, go over the financial numbers, tell people the offer you've got, the other gold and silver at that lower price has run out, you've got a little bit left now of one offering, so this is the end.
[02:00:43.895 --> 02:00:51.520]  I'd be happy to do it.
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:57.023]  I mean, probably the first thing that we should talk about is what happened over at Barrick Gold.
[02:00:57.023 --> 02:01:02.767]  If people understand, what they need to understand is that gold mines will sell the gold that they have in the ground.
[02:01:02.767 --> 02:01:05.949]  They know that they can produce so much gold in a certain period of time
[02:01:06.469 --> 02:01:14.694]  So what they'll do is they'll lock in on the prices today and they'll basically deliver the gold later because that's how the futures contract works.
[02:01:14.694 --> 02:01:19.796]  And they expect to be able to pull the gold out of the ore from the ground in their mine.
[02:01:19.796 --> 02:01:23.058]  Farmers do this with corn and beans.
[02:01:23.058 --> 02:01:26.800]  They'll sell their crop even before they have picked their crop and harvested it.
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:27.421]  We're good.
[02:01:41.670 --> 02:02:00.635]  When Barrick Gold decided to default on its short contracts, what that meant is that all this gold that they're going to be selling into the marketplace, which equated to gold sold into the market and driving the price down, was just taken off the marketplace, which is probably a lot of the reason why we're seeing it jump up into the thousand dollar range right now.
[02:02:00.635 --> 02:02:08.238]  But what Stiglitz was talking about is that we're going to have a banking crisis that is much greater in ferocity than we had in the year 2007,
[02:02:09.918 --> 02:02:20.225]  When Hank Paulson and President Bush were trying to put together the 700 trillion dollar bailout plan for that thing, the TARP money.
[02:02:20.225 --> 02:02:35.114]  And what's going on, or what he's trying to recommend to President Barack Obama, is that they break down the larger banks into smaller banks, so when there is a crisis, one of these things topple, they're not too big to fail, and they don't need to be bailed out quite so hard.
[02:02:35.114 --> 02:02:39.337]  Well, the exact opposite is happening right now, because when Barack Obama
[02:02:39.717 --> 02:02:43.218]  Is talking about throwing more power to the Federal Reserve System.
[02:02:43.218 --> 02:02:48.140]  That means that their member banks are going to be the ones that get bailed out.
[02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:52.622]  And when they get bailed out, they take that money and they use it to buy up toxic assets.
[02:02:52.622 --> 02:02:57.523]  Or banks that are failing, they use our tax dollars to bail out these smaller companies.
[02:02:57.523 --> 02:03:01.745]  And that's just going to create more havoc and more ruckus into the marketplace.
[02:03:01.745 --> 02:03:03.225]  And it's not good for the U.S.
[02:03:03.225 --> 02:03:08.207]  dollar because the Chinese right now are watching us do this and the printing press running full-time.
[02:03:08.687 --> 02:03:12.271]  And they're thinking about selling off their 3.3 trillion dollars worth of U.S.
[02:03:12.271 --> 02:03:19.339]  government securities, and obviously that's driving down the value of the dollar, but at the same time it's driving up the price of gold.
[02:03:19.339 --> 02:03:21.461]  There's another thing that they did at this time, too.
[02:03:21.461 --> 02:03:29.570]  They want to make sure that they have enough gold in reserves in their nation, so they're allowing their own private citizens to buy gold at this particular time.
[02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:43.380]  Which is driving up the demand even further and that's why we're seeing gold rise at the same time where we have a credit implosion here in the United States and inflation actually is being held at bay just due to the fact that there's so much unemployment.
[02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:51.666]  So really right at this particular time Alex, as I can see it, we really need to be looking at precious metals and the 35, it was like 35 to 1 of the
[02:03:56.269 --> 02:04:01.131]  Of the insider traders that are selling actually the stock market right now.
[02:04:01.131 --> 02:04:03.993]  You know, one bullish, 35 bearish.
[02:04:03.993 --> 02:04:07.374]  These people know what's going on out there in the real world.
[02:04:07.374 --> 02:04:10.136]  And even Warren Buffett himself is getting out of that market.
[02:04:10.136 --> 02:04:16.739]  So, you know, I just know where the stage is being set right now for a big plummet in the stock market.
[02:04:16.739 --> 02:04:19.200]  I don't know exactly when and how far that's going to go.
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:35.989]  But, you know, with the gold prices going up into the thousands, all I can say is the timing right now to be getting into the gold is right, and I do believe that there will be time in the future when we're looking back at a thousand five, a thousand seven, a thousand nine, and thinking that that is a really good buy.
[02:04:35.989 --> 02:04:40.212]  So if you have the chance to do it, if you look at your portfolio, call us at 800-686-8000.
[02:04:42.333 --> 02:04:46.977]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:05:06.954 --> 02:05:10.176]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:10.176 --> 02:05:10.877]  Number 2.
[02:05:10.877 --> 02:05:16.080]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:16.721]  It's true.
[02:05:16.721 --> 02:05:21.144]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.144 --> 02:05:22.085]  Number 3.
[02:05:22.085 --> 02:05:27.688]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:05:27.688 --> 02:05:28.369]  Number 4.
[02:05:28.369 --> 02:05:31.271]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:05:31.271 --> 02:05:34.933]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:34.933 --> 02:05:35.154]  Number 5.
[02:05:35.774 --> 02:05:39.615]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:05:39.615 --> 02:05:45.357]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[02:06:37.274 --> 02:06:39.814]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:39.814 --> 02:06:44.535]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.

[02:07:00.916 --> 02:07:03.918]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:03.918 --> 02:07:09.261]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.261 --> 02:07:11.302]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.302 --> 02:07:16.305]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.305 --> 02:07:17.226]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.486 --> 02:07:18.607]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.607 --> 02:07:20.489]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.489 --> 02:07:21.570]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.570 --> 02:07:23.772]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.772 --> 02:07:25.113]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.113 --> 02:07:26.634]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.634 --> 02:07:31.919]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:31.919 --> 02:07:35.503]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.503 --> 02:07:38.966]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.306 --> 02:07:40.527]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.527 --> 02:07:41.427]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.427 --> 02:07:42.527]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.527 --> 02:07:43.468]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.468 --> 02:07:44.568]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.568 --> 02:07:47.610]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.610 --> 02:07:49.391]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.391 --> 02:07:50.291]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:02.128 --> 02:08:04.849]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.849 --> 02:08:12.491]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.491 --> 02:08:15.112]  Man, I was just talking to Charlie Sheen again during the break.
[02:08:15.112 --> 02:08:17.633]  A lot of crazy stuff going on behind the scenes.
[02:08:17.633 --> 02:08:25.416]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, he's going to be on with us covering a host of big developments and issues, so stay with us for that.
[02:08:25.416 --> 02:08:29.597]  In fact, cue up that piece of trash from Fox News.
[02:08:31.758 --> 02:08:32.459]  Cue him up.
[02:08:32.459 --> 02:08:39.364]  I mean, talk about a slimy guy misrepresenting what Charlie Sheen said.
[02:08:39.364 --> 02:08:45.608]  Charlie is bringing up the Commissioner members, six of the ten, saying the official story is a lie, a fraud, and a cover-up.
[02:08:45.608 --> 02:08:53.034]  Charlie's bringing up Sybil Edmonds, the FBI translator, coming out and saying Bin Laden and al-Qaeda were working for the U.S.
[02:08:53.034 --> 02:08:55.155]  government up until the day of 9-11.
[02:08:55.155 --> 02:08:58.938]  She testified secretly to Congress on that.
[02:08:58.938 --> 02:08:59.959]  Charlie's bringing up
[02:09:01.187 --> 02:09:07.089]  All these real issues, and he is being demonized like I have never seen.
[02:09:07.089 --> 02:09:16.231]  And then these cowards, like John McCain's daughter, she goes on The View and demonizes him, and then Charlie directly challenges her.
[02:09:16.231 --> 02:09:18.872]  And we directly challenged her and emailed her.
[02:09:18.872 --> 02:09:24.553]  And say, fine, you come out, name the place and time live to debate Charlie, and they won't do it.
[02:09:26.977 --> 02:09:30.379]  Just absolutely amazing to see them do that type of stuff.
[02:09:30.379 --> 02:09:32.240]  If you want that video, it's actually on YouTube.
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:37.543]  But yeah, here is that program, Greg Gutfield.
[02:09:37.543 --> 02:09:46.508]  And I will let you know, old Greg Gutfield's really asking for the lawyers to take the gloves off, I'll tell you that.
[02:09:46.508 --> 02:09:48.769]  Because this is libel and slander.
[02:09:48.769 --> 02:09:53.452]  And if it's done with malice of forethought, to cause harm to somebody, you got a big problem.
[02:09:55.168 --> 02:09:58.329]  Totally distorting what Charlie has had to say.
[02:09:58.329 --> 02:10:02.330]  Absolutely distorting the reality of it.
[02:10:02.330 --> 02:10:05.471]  Charlie makes tens of millions of dollars a year.
[02:10:05.471 --> 02:10:06.791]  He has a lot to lose doing this.
[02:10:06.791 --> 02:10:11.533]  He did this because he can't let the continual lie of 9-11 just keep going on.
[02:10:11.533 --> 02:10:18.334]  And you can't just call us names and demonize us and have it go away.
[02:10:18.334 --> 02:10:19.535]  Let's go ahead and play it.
[02:10:19.535 --> 02:10:19.875]  Here it is.
[02:10:20.734 --> 02:10:26.417]  So Charlie Sheen has penned a fictitious conversation with President Obama regarding the 9-11 attack.
[02:10:26.417 --> 02:10:39.825]  See, the star of Scary Movie 3 and Scary Movie 4 believes that Bush Cheney planned it all and feels Obama should investigate it immediately in an effort to answer a quote, bottomless warren of unanswered questions.
[02:10:39.825 --> 02:10:40.586]  Bottomless.
[02:10:40.586 --> 02:10:44.908]  Now, never mind how repulsive this is to anyone personally affected by the terror attack.
[02:10:44.908 --> 02:10:48.951]  Sheen is just awesome for revealing what makes conspiracy theorists so...
[02:10:50.862 --> 02:10:53.744]  Notice, he misrepresents what Sheen has said.
[02:10:53.744 --> 02:10:58.127]  Sheen's saying, I have questions that need to be investigated.
[02:10:58.127 --> 02:11:00.988]  Then he says, Sheen is hurting the families.
[02:11:00.988 --> 02:11:05.451]  That's the slander and libel right there in the defamation.
[02:11:05.451 --> 02:11:10.334]  This was also put out in text, so it's libel.
[02:11:10.334 --> 02:11:12.375]  Implying that it's hurting the families.
[02:11:12.375 --> 02:11:18.159]  Saying Charlie Sheen is hurting families when the majority of the families are on record
[02:11:19.528 --> 02:11:22.649]  Saying they believe 9-11's an inside job.
[02:11:22.649 --> 02:11:30.492]  This guy misrepresents the families and says Charlie is hurting them.
[02:11:30.492 --> 02:11:36.694]  Charlie is hurting the families.
[02:11:36.694 --> 02:11:42.516]  And then he tries to imply like Charlie Sheen's got this big head because he writes in the piece the President likes two and a half men.
[02:11:42.516 --> 02:11:45.857]  Charlie was writing that saying, well let's write this like me and the President are being friendly.
[02:11:46.847 --> 02:11:49.269]  And, uh, you know, make the president look cool.
[02:11:49.269 --> 02:11:51.590]  It wasn't to make Charlie look big.
[02:11:51.590 --> 02:11:54.872]  But, but, here's the distortion.
[02:11:54.872 --> 02:11:59.194]  Now, never mind how repulsive this is to anyone personally affected by the terror attack.
[02:11:59.194 --> 02:12:03.977]  Sheen is just awesome for revealing what makes a conspiracy theorist.
[02:12:03.977 --> 02:12:06.839]  How repulsive it is to anyone.
[02:12:06.839 --> 02:12:13.883]  See, this guy's representing everyone who was attacked, doesn't like Sheen, and Sheen's basically with the terrorists now.
[02:12:15.131 --> 02:12:20.742]  This little slime ball thinks he's smart reading off that teleprompter what was written up for him by Psyops.
[02:12:20.742 --> 02:12:21.543]  Like he's cute.
[02:12:21.543 --> 02:12:24.048]  It's fun to manipulate his audience.
[02:12:24.048 --> 02:12:24.990]  What a deceiver.
[02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:25.471]  Back to it.
[02:12:27.059 --> 02:12:28.879]  First, the egomania.
[02:12:28.879 --> 02:12:33.780]  In this open letter he wrote, he writes that the president admits liking two and a half men.
[02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:36.801]  And here I thought Martin was the crazy one in the family.
[02:12:36.801 --> 02:12:38.721]  Second, there's the mental masturbation.
[02:12:38.721 --> 02:12:40.222]  I apologize for using that word.
[02:12:40.222 --> 02:12:47.843]  But when it comes to truth or obsession, the questioning will always be, as Shane says, bottomless.
[02:12:47.843 --> 02:12:51.504]  It is bottomless when you look at all the evidence.
[02:12:51.504 --> 02:12:54.625]  You called his conspiracy theorist that Gulf of Tonkin wasn't staged.
[02:12:54.625 --> 02:12:55.625]  Now declassified.
[02:12:56.761 --> 02:12:59.923]  Now declassified the CIA was involved with Kennedy.
[02:12:59.923 --> 02:13:03.065]  And the head shooter's gone public.
[02:13:03.065 --> 02:13:07.888]  In Rolling Stone, and on this radio show, with the audio tape and video.
[02:13:07.888 --> 02:13:10.690]  E. Howard Hunt.
[02:13:10.690 --> 02:13:12.911]  We now know Cheney did lie about WMDs.
[02:13:12.911 --> 02:13:16.434]  We now know Cheney wanted to bomb our own ships and blame it on foreign governments.
[02:13:16.434 --> 02:13:21.757]  Even the Daily Mail in England is saying they think this new Al Qaeda tape, bin Laden tape, is fake.
[02:13:24.102 --> 02:13:26.449]  Even conservative publications.
[02:13:26.449 --> 02:13:29.118]  You... He's just so sniveling and cowardly.
[02:13:29.118 --> 02:13:29.619]  Go back to him.
[02:13:31.524 --> 02:13:39.631]  It's an endless bag of Doritos, except instead of chips, you get comebacks like, oh, that's what they want you to think, and open your eyes, dude.
[02:13:39.631 --> 02:13:41.893]  It'd be funny if it wasn't so sad.
[02:13:41.893 --> 02:13:44.135]  And my favorite, the contradictions.
[02:13:44.135 --> 02:13:49.779]  Sheen claims that 9-11 was the pretext for systematic dismantling of our Constitution.
[02:13:49.779 --> 02:13:54.943]  He says this without realizing that since 9-11, not a single person has shut him up!
[02:13:54.943 --> 02:13:59.227]  His relentless babble has done more to prove there's no cover-up than anything ever!
[02:13:59.787 --> 02:14:04.768]  Damn, I wish the government would silence him or at least give him a better haircut suited for a middle-aged man.
[02:14:04.768 --> 02:14:06.349]  It's strange, I tell you.
[02:14:06.349 --> 02:14:10.790]  But look, I love Sheen because he's a man unencumbered by self-awareness.
[02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:11.570]  Think about it.
[02:14:11.570 --> 02:14:21.973]  The man's, he's the world's most clueless, druggy, gambling-addicted whore-banger, and he thinks he's uncovered a conspiracy and that we should all believe him.
[02:14:21.973 --> 02:14:23.393]  How cute is that?
[02:14:23.393 --> 02:14:25.334]  And if you disagree with me, then you're probably a racist.
[02:14:28.843 --> 02:14:36.669]  So he just threw everything, including the kitchen sink, at people.
[02:14:36.669 --> 02:14:40.091]  They've introduced bills that have passed the House to ban free speech.
[02:14:40.091 --> 02:14:41.692]  They've reintroduced the Fairness Doctrine.
[02:14:41.692 --> 02:14:42.913]  They're trying to implement it.
[02:14:42.913 --> 02:14:48.197]  The diversity chief on tape said he wants Venezuelan-type controls.
[02:14:48.197 --> 02:14:57.183]  They are on the verge of passing the Cybersecurity Act that in the New York Times they admit will, quote, have a kindler, gentler internet with government gatekeepers.
[02:14:59.178 --> 02:15:03.521]  Charlie Sheen behind the scenes is under all sorts of heat to shut up.
[02:15:03.521 --> 02:15:05.223]  You may hear about that soon here on the air.
[02:15:08.655 --> 02:15:22.864]  Mark Cuban, the New York Times now admits, had the White House email him and call him, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and say, if you don't shut up and not make that loose change final cut film, we're going to indict you for something.
[02:15:22.864 --> 02:15:24.585]  And a year later, they did it.
[02:15:24.585 --> 02:15:30.329]  Cuban used the email and the phone call to defeat the phony case.
[02:15:30.329 --> 02:15:31.410]  You understand?
[02:15:31.410 --> 02:15:37.294]  This guy's making jokes about how our free speech isn't under attack when it publicly is?
[02:15:42.282 --> 02:15:44.584]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:15:44.584 --> 02:15:48.246]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:15:48.246 --> 02:15:54.491]  Let's go ahead and talk to Stephen in Mexico City.
[02:15:54.491 --> 02:15:55.451]  Stephen, you're on the air.
[02:15:55.451 --> 02:15:56.572]  Welcome.
[02:15:56.572 --> 02:15:57.713]  Hey, Alex.
[02:15:57.713 --> 02:15:59.294]  Wow.
[02:15:59.294 --> 02:16:00.655]  Greetings from Mexico.
[02:16:00.655 --> 02:16:03.016]  You're our lifeline of truth here, huh?
[02:16:03.016 --> 02:16:05.538]  For Wi-Fi radio.
[02:16:05.538 --> 02:16:06.579]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[02:16:06.579 --> 02:16:07.299]  Thanks for tuning in.
[02:16:07.299 --> 02:16:07.880]  What's on your mind?
[02:16:08.689 --> 02:16:08.829]  Really?
[02:16:37.671 --> 02:16:39.612]  Yeah, really.
[02:16:39.612 --> 02:16:41.733]  I looked at it several times to make sure.
[02:16:41.733 --> 02:16:43.194]  It definitely is.
[02:16:43.194 --> 02:16:47.136]  It comes on for like a half a second, but it's there.
[02:16:47.136 --> 02:16:48.917]  It's really bizarre.
[02:16:48.917 --> 02:16:52.439]  Well, that Obama joker is now extremely iconic.
[02:16:52.439 --> 02:16:54.160]  Well, let me tell you, down here it is.
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:17:00.823]  Especially, you should know, in the national university community, UNAM.
[02:17:00.823 --> 02:17:06.546]  That is the center of the activity here.
[02:17:09.114 --> 02:17:13.996]  uh... with posters and uh... they screen your films too.
[02:17:13.996 --> 02:17:17.097]  So in Mexico City they're showing my documentaries?
[02:17:17.097 --> 02:17:21.638]  Oh yeah, at the university and uh... it's free showing so nobody's making money on it.
[02:17:21.638 --> 02:17:22.719]  That's good, I'm glad.
[02:17:22.719 --> 02:17:29.741]  No, no, I want a real cult following, you know, among the poli sci kids, you know, politics kids and all of that.
[02:17:29.741 --> 02:17:37.584]  Another bullet, as far as boy scouts, somebody relayed to me that they're asking kids
[02:17:38.228 --> 02:17:42.871]  Very discreetly if they've seen firearms in the houses of their parents.
[02:17:42.871 --> 02:17:44.593]  You know, I forgot that part.
[02:17:44.593 --> 02:17:46.234]  That's going on here in the U.S.
[02:17:46.234 --> 02:17:47.315]  as well.
[02:17:47.315 --> 02:17:52.138]  They're asking Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, the schools, the pediatricians ask.
[02:17:52.138 --> 02:17:56.802]  And this father calls in and says, what's wrong with Homeland Security working with my Girl Scout?
[02:17:56.802 --> 02:17:58.143]  He just doesn't understand.
[02:17:58.143 --> 02:17:59.864]  Not whatsoever.
[02:17:59.864 --> 02:18:01.305]  It's history.
[02:18:01.305 --> 02:18:01.745]  History.
[02:18:01.745 --> 02:18:02.846]  Read about the Hitler Youth.
[02:18:02.846 --> 02:18:04.807]  You understand what's happening there.
[02:18:04.807 --> 02:18:05.568]  It's very clear.
[02:18:05.834 --> 02:18:10.777]  So you're saying in Mexico, though, they've got the Boy Scouts and stuff spying on people?
[02:18:10.777 --> 02:18:11.517]  Absolutely.
[02:18:11.517 --> 02:18:15.839]  And here, you know, things are a little bit softer here, less of an edge.
[02:18:15.839 --> 02:18:17.560]  And it's just a discreet question.
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:20.141]  One kid told his dad, and that's it.
[02:18:20.141 --> 02:18:21.162]  They yanked him out of there.
[02:18:21.162 --> 02:18:22.803]  I mean, people do know what that is.
[02:18:22.803 --> 02:18:24.764]  People are very sensitive to that kind of stuff.
[02:18:24.764 --> 02:18:30.327]  Yeah, I will say that in Latin America, where I've traveled quite a bit, people know not to trust the government.
[02:18:30.327 --> 02:18:32.808]  I mean, Americans are just so gullible.
[02:18:34.779 --> 02:18:37.380]  And we used to be some of the most untrusting of government.
[02:18:37.380 --> 02:18:41.342]  Now we're starting to lose that trust, thank God.
[02:18:41.342 --> 02:18:46.565]  But at the same time, I mean, you know, the government wanting anything from your kids is bad.
[02:18:47.947 --> 02:18:48.728]  Absolutely.
[02:18:48.728 --> 02:18:49.188]  Absolutely.
[02:18:49.188 --> 02:18:50.450]  Because it's a tool.
[02:18:50.450 --> 02:18:51.070]  That's all it is.
[02:18:51.070 --> 02:18:53.192]  But people are very on edge about that here.
[02:18:53.192 --> 02:18:55.134]  Another thing is Charlie Sheen.
[02:18:55.134 --> 02:18:58.497]  He's very big down here, and people are all behind him on this.
[02:18:58.497 --> 02:19:02.081]  Not only the expats like me, but everybody.
[02:19:02.081 --> 02:19:04.864]  Well, because of his Mexican ancestry, you know.
[02:19:04.864 --> 02:19:07.746]  Yeah, he's got a Spanish estevez.
[02:19:07.746 --> 02:19:09.928]  So, what are they saying?
[02:19:09.928 --> 02:19:11.710]  I mean, you're hearing them talk about Sheen and 9-11?
[02:19:12.831 --> 02:19:15.112]  Absolutely, but that's it.
[02:19:15.112 --> 02:19:18.373]  That position was taken here from day one.
[02:19:18.373 --> 02:19:21.134]  Literally, because I was here from day one.
[02:19:21.134 --> 02:19:23.615]  And official stories, none of it.
[02:19:23.615 --> 02:19:31.758]  It's endemic in the blood and in the very nature of the people here to immediately question anything that's a government statement.
[02:19:31.758 --> 02:19:32.198]  Immediately.
[02:19:33.359 --> 02:19:36.721]  You know, it's part of life here.
[02:19:36.721 --> 02:19:38.542]  Well, Steve, I'm glad I went to you.
[02:19:38.542 --> 02:19:41.564]  Keep calling in from time to time with reports from Mexico City.
[02:19:41.564 --> 02:19:43.185]  That was a great call.
[02:19:43.185 --> 02:19:45.746]  Pick and others, your calls are coming up.
[02:19:45.746 --> 02:19:48.687]  Then Charlie Sheen live, and boy is he fired up.
[02:19:48.687 --> 02:19:52.109]  Look out, ladies and gentlemen, because here comes the Tiger.
[02:19:52.109 --> 02:19:54.551]  He is fired up.
[02:19:54.551 --> 02:19:55.691]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:55.691 --> 02:19:57.072]  We'll be right back after this quick break.

[02:22:01.519 --> 02:22:08.260]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:09.921]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:22:10.908 --> 02:22:12.450]  But who is the enemy?
[02:22:12.450 --> 02:22:13.271]  Bin Laden.
[02:22:13.271 --> 02:22:14.292]  This is his ammo.
[02:22:14.292 --> 02:22:15.613]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:22:15.613 --> 02:22:17.616]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:22:17.616 --> 02:22:24.764]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:22:24.764 --> 02:22:25.244]  Some U.S.
[02:22:25.244 --> 02:22:30.890]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:22:31.591 --> 02:22:35.093]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:22:35.093 --> 02:22:37.895]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:23:01.300 --> 02:23:03.001]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:23:03.001 --> 02:23:04.741]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:23:04.741 --> 02:23:07.422]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:23:07.422 --> 02:23:12.544]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:23:12.544 --> 02:23:15.745]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[02:23:15.745 --> 02:23:19.206]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[02:23:35.937 --> 02:23:38.399]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[02:23:38.759 --> 02:23:39.679]  I hear the train a-comin'
[02:24:08.143 --> 02:24:11.466]  We got Charlie Sheen coming up live in the next segment.
[02:24:30.163 --> 02:24:35.865]  Oh look, Rockefeller and company CEO dies from apparent suicide.
[02:24:35.865 --> 02:24:42.428]  James McDonald, prominent advisor to the wealthy families and chief executive of the investment management group Rockefeller & Co.
[02:24:42.428 --> 02:24:46.690]  died of a single gunshot wound to the head on Sunday, local authorities said.
[02:24:46.690 --> 02:24:51.151]  A lot of people commit suicide that work for the Rockefellers.
[02:24:51.151 --> 02:24:54.953]  Don't you do anything wrong or you die.
[02:24:56.471 --> 02:24:57.872]  Be sure and take your vaccines.
[02:24:57.872 --> 02:24:59.772]  They're the ones that pioneered all that.
[02:24:59.772 --> 02:25:03.134]  Making sure you and your family take it.
[02:25:03.134 --> 02:25:05.555]  Let's talk to Annalisa in San Fran.
[02:25:05.555 --> 02:25:06.855]  You're on the air.
[02:25:06.855 --> 02:25:08.176]  Welcome.
[02:25:08.176 --> 02:25:09.816]  Hi Alex.
[02:25:09.816 --> 02:25:12.918]  I'm calling you about Senate Bill 1649.
[02:25:12.918 --> 02:25:14.178]  Have you heard of this bill yet?
[02:25:14.178 --> 02:25:17.480]  It was introduced September 8th.
[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:19.841]  Refresh my memory.
[02:25:19.841 --> 02:25:21.621]  I'm sorry?
[02:25:21.621 --> 02:25:23.182]  Refresh my memory.
[02:25:23.604 --> 02:25:31.045]  Okay, okay, this is the Weapons of Mass Destruction Prevention and Preparedness Act of 2009.
[02:25:31.045 --> 02:25:34.326]  Oh, that's got some anti-gun provisions in it.
[02:25:34.326 --> 02:25:44.668]  Yeah, and it also enlists the postmaster to deliver medical countermeasure kits to the American public.
[02:25:44.668 --> 02:25:47.988]  I did see an article about that, but I'd forgotten to cover it.
[02:25:47.988 --> 02:25:49.509]  Tell us more about it.
[02:25:49.509 --> 02:25:51.109]  Well, it's pretty creepy.
[02:25:52.162 --> 02:25:59.707]  It also signs us up, the Americans, to pay for other country's security measures for their weapons of mass destruction.
[02:25:59.707 --> 02:26:06.512]  And throughout the bill, it pretty much references that appropriations will be made as necessary, so it's another blank check.
[02:26:10.672 --> 02:26:11.913]  Just like the energy bill.
[02:26:11.913 --> 02:26:17.196]  We're going to be paying for other countries' energy conservation measures as well.
[02:26:17.196 --> 02:26:19.758]  We're signed up in the last 200 pages of that one.
[02:26:19.758 --> 02:26:23.921]  No, it's all about destroying the economy for vertical integration.
[02:26:23.921 --> 02:26:26.343]  China, India and others have to make no cuts.
[02:26:26.343 --> 02:26:31.126]  We have to make cuts on carbon dioxide that isn't carbon.
[02:26:31.126 --> 02:26:32.246]  It's a gas.
[02:26:32.246 --> 02:26:34.188]  That is what plants breathe.
[02:26:34.188 --> 02:26:38.310]  And they've got some of the public convinced that it's a deadly nerve gas that kills you.
[02:26:38.310 --> 02:26:40.352]  They've now listed it as a toxic waste.
[02:26:41.353 --> 02:26:45.395]  Next, they'll list dihydrogen monoxide or water.
[02:26:45.395 --> 02:26:49.338]  You can go to the average person and say, should we ban dihydrogen monoxide?
[02:26:49.338 --> 02:26:51.859]  And they will say, yes.
[02:26:51.859 --> 02:26:55.402]  They don't know that dihydrogen monoxide is water.
[02:26:55.402 --> 02:26:59.384]  The average person, if you say, let's ban sodium chloride, they'll say, ban it.
[02:26:59.384 --> 02:27:00.725]  They'll sign a petition.
[02:27:00.725 --> 02:27:03.927]  Sodium chloride is table salt.
[02:27:03.927 --> 02:27:09.251]  And there's no end to how much people love to be conned and raped.
[02:27:13.206 --> 02:27:13.987]  You're right about that.
[02:27:13.987 --> 02:27:20.891]  Um, I was just calling to bring it to your attention because I hadn't heard you talk about it, so.
[02:27:20.891 --> 02:27:22.432]  Thank you so much, good to hear from you.
[02:27:22.432 --> 02:27:25.514]  Josh in California, you're on the air.
[02:27:25.514 --> 02:27:27.516]  Hey Alex, first of all I want to say thanks to you.
[02:27:27.516 --> 02:27:30.878]  Thank you Charlie and all InfoWarriors out there doing the hard work you're doing.
[02:27:30.878 --> 02:27:32.759]  This is the way we're going to take our country back.
[02:27:32.759 --> 02:27:34.400]  Well Charlie is on hold right now.
[02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:35.701]  We're about to go to him in the next break.
[02:27:35.701 --> 02:27:38.603]  You want to tell him thank you face to face?
[02:27:38.603 --> 02:27:40.324]  Absolutely, I sure would.
[02:27:40.324 --> 02:27:41.345]  Go ahead, tell him.
[02:27:41.789 --> 02:27:43.210]  Charlie, thank you very much, man.
[02:27:43.210 --> 02:27:44.971]  What you're doing is awesome.
[02:27:44.971 --> 02:27:51.796]  I know that you have so much to lose through all this, and this is awesome what you're doing, and I stand with you.
[02:27:51.796 --> 02:27:53.837]  I support you and all the Infowars and what you're doing.
[02:27:53.837 --> 02:27:54.798]  This is frickin' awesome.
[02:28:13.186 --> 02:28:16.427]  When he knew the government already went after Mark Cuban.
[02:28:16.427 --> 02:28:21.350]  The White House called him and said don't put that movie out or we'll indict you.
[02:28:21.350 --> 02:28:24.491]  And then it came out later they did indict him.
[02:28:24.491 --> 02:28:26.612]  We're dealing with serious criminals.
[02:28:26.612 --> 02:28:34.035]  Charlie Sheen is just an amazing hero with cojones he's got to carry around in a wheelbarrow.
[02:28:35.913 --> 02:28:39.354]  I don't understand why he would put this together or criticize.
[02:28:39.354 --> 02:28:47.456]  Look, researchers are good at doing research, but it takes someone who knows how to write a script to package all the research into something really marketable, and that's what he's done.
[02:28:47.456 --> 02:28:52.137]  He's done what he's an expert at doing, and so for all the people who are concerned about that, don't.
[02:28:52.137 --> 02:28:52.998]  It's in the hands of an expert.
[02:28:52.998 --> 02:28:54.938]  Oh, look, that's COINTELPRO.
[02:28:54.938 --> 02:28:56.179]  We could, you know...
[02:28:59.099 --> 02:29:01.160]  Give people a pot of gold, they'd get mad.
[02:29:01.160 --> 02:29:15.125]  They're going to bitch about what we do because they want to make it about us, and I appreciate your call, not about the banks taking over, not about the corruption, not about all the wars expanding, not about government-sponsored false flag terror.
[02:29:15.125 --> 02:29:16.925]  That's always going to happen.
[02:29:16.925 --> 02:29:22.548]  Whoever is in the arena, like Teddy Roosevelt said, are going to be the people getting the heat.
[02:29:22.548 --> 02:29:23.348]  But that's also
[02:29:24.571 --> 02:29:29.453]  Who will be remembered in history, and that's also the people that make society good.
[02:29:29.453 --> 02:29:32.574]  The cowards are the people that make society bad.
[02:29:32.574 --> 02:29:41.617]  We know evil's out there, but it's the cowards that rationalize and make excuses that go along with all of this that allow tyranny to reign.
[02:29:41.617 --> 02:29:50.160]  Charlie Sheen on the other side of this quick break with a lot of really important announcements and his response to the cowards that won't debate him.
[02:29:51.707 --> 02:29:55.632]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.632 --> 02:29:58.315]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.862 --> 02:30:05.083]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.083 --> 02:30:07.083]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.083 --> 02:30:15.605]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.605 --> 02:30:21.167]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.167 --> 02:30:22.767]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:23.027 --> 02:30:29.528]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.528 --> 02:30:40.591]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.591 --> 02:30:41.351]  That's right.
[02:30:41.351 --> 02:30:43.931]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:30:43.931 --> 02:30:45.512]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:30:48.092 --> 02:31:06.083]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:06.083 --> 02:31:10.605]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.605 --> 02:31:12.886]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.886 --> 02:31:14.507]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.507 --> 02:31:15.548]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.768 --> 02:31:24.195]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:31:24.195 --> 02:31:31.661]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:31:31.661 --> 02:31:37.705]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:31:37.705 --> 02:31:43.290]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:31:43.710 --> 02:31:47.853]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[02:31:47.853 --> 02:31:54.038]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.

[02:32:01.363 --> 02:32:02.103]  Hello, friends.
[02:32:02.103 --> 02:32:05.224]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[02:32:05.224 --> 02:32:15.386]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned, pure, handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.
[02:32:15.386 --> 02:32:19.327]  Go to 5starsoaps.com or click on their link at infowars.com.
[02:32:19.327 --> 02:32:21.288]  They have been a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:32:21.288 --> 02:32:25.108]  Cal Bend Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity, and value.
[02:32:25.108 --> 02:32:27.249]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[02:32:27.669 --> 02:32:32.877]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.
[02:32:32.877 --> 02:32:37.904]  Check out their whole line of bath, hair, laundry, and dish soap and more at 5starsoap.com.
[02:32:37.904 --> 02:32:42.832]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:32:43.272 --> 02:32:44.552]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:32:44.552 --> 02:32:53.355]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling toll-free 1-800-340-7091 or check them out online at 5starsoap.com.

[02:32:56.895 --> 02:32:57.856]  You're going to love them.
[02:32:57.856 --> 02:32:59.476]  You will never use anything else again.
[02:33:09.707 --> 02:33:13.431]  Well, we've got a true American hero on the line with us.
[02:33:13.431 --> 02:33:16.754]  Highest paid star in television.
[02:33:16.754 --> 02:33:21.459]  Major endorsements of big products.
[02:33:21.459 --> 02:33:31.370]  But Charlie Sheen, for the second time, and in even more of a bold fashion, came out with his 20 minutes to the president, those 20 key bullet points.
[02:33:31.370 --> 02:33:32.471]  60% of the commission saying,
[02:33:32.871 --> 02:33:34.632]  A cover-up, a lie, a fraud.
[02:33:34.632 --> 02:33:38.295]  There should be a criminal investigation of the White House and Pentagon.
[02:33:38.295 --> 02:33:40.016]  He said, these are my questions.
[02:33:40.016 --> 02:33:48.502]  I'd like to meet with you, Mr. President, with Bob McElveen, with some of the other survivors and their families, who want to meet with you and call for a real investigation.
[02:33:48.502 --> 02:33:51.724]  This is the change I voted for.
[02:33:51.724 --> 02:33:55.767]  And the media spun it and said, Charlie Sheen wants to hurt the families.
[02:33:55.767 --> 02:33:58.569]  The families all hating, with no evidence.
[02:33:58.569 --> 02:34:02.112]  True defamation, true slander, true libel.
[02:34:03.701 --> 02:34:07.643]  And so Charlie last Friday issued the challenge.
[02:34:07.643 --> 02:34:18.790]  He said, any of you people, the daughter of McCain, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, you come on a live TV show, you debate me on the facts.
[02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:22.592]  I'll bring the truth, you bring popular mechanics, whoever you want.
[02:34:22.592 --> 02:34:26.615]  And these cowards are real tough with their teleprompters, but they won't debate him.
[02:34:26.615 --> 02:34:28.676]  But they have ratcheted up the attacks
[02:34:30.185 --> 02:34:32.126]  To the nastiest stuff I've ever seen.
[02:34:32.126 --> 02:34:37.909]  There's a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes as well, but that'll come out in the future if Charlie wants to bring it out.
[02:34:37.909 --> 02:34:41.271]  Regardless, 9-11 Truth back on the front burner.
[02:34:41.271 --> 02:34:50.075]  The establishment wasn't just able to use it for their police state and their wars this 8th anniversary, and now we're seeing all the new tapes coming out trying to counter us.
[02:34:50.075 --> 02:34:51.976]  Charlie Sheen, great to have you here with us.
[02:34:51.976 --> 02:34:52.837]  Great to be here, Alex.
[02:34:52.837 --> 02:34:54.037]  How are you, man?
[02:34:54.037 --> 02:34:54.918]  Good.
[02:34:54.918 --> 02:34:56.299]  There's a lot to talk about.
[02:34:57.466 --> 02:34:58.386]  Yes, there is.
[02:34:58.386 --> 02:34:59.267]  Yes, there is.
[02:34:59.267 --> 02:35:01.368]  Where shall we start?
[02:35:01.368 --> 02:35:04.710]  Wherever you'd like.
[02:35:04.710 --> 02:35:18.177]  Well, I think we've got to talk about this continuing mainstream media attack that is just so unfounded and just baseless and without merit.
[02:35:18.177 --> 02:35:25.000]  It's so desperately trying to swing the focus into a different direction that is just mired and blatant.
[02:35:25.390 --> 02:35:31.374]  Well that's why they're all losing market share is because people don't trust a damn thing they say and
[02:35:52.588 --> 02:36:00.234]  We've got polls of 83% on CNN supporting you, 84% questioning the official story in the New York Times.
[02:36:00.234 --> 02:36:06.819]  You're bad for reading the Washington Post quoting six of the ten commissioners, saying it's a fraud.
[02:36:06.819 --> 02:36:08.841]  But see, they won't counter that.
[02:36:08.841 --> 02:36:11.303]  They make up stuff you never said.
[02:36:11.303 --> 02:36:22.032]  Yeah, they are really insistent on spinning all sorts of quotes, theories, beliefs and ideas and statements.
[02:36:22.867 --> 02:36:47.588]  That I've put forth, and it's such a blatant misrepresentation of what you and I have been so painstakingly focused on here, and so careful about the bullet points that we chose, the way that we constructed the letter, and the message that we're delivering, that it's just...
[02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:55.464]  I've got to believe at some point there could be some legal action here, you know?
[02:36:55.464 --> 02:37:16.243]  I'm not saying that's where I'm headed with this, because I think we've got bigger fish to fry than these, you know, worthless douchebags, but it's just a shame that they've created the illusion that they command the truth, that they hold all the cards, that what they say is law, when in fact it is
[02:37:17.449 --> 02:37:24.815]  It's quite the opposite, you know, when they're making statements, or the statements that I made about, you know, Bush and Cheney were behind this thing.
[02:37:24.815 --> 02:37:26.075]  It's an absolute cover-up.
[02:37:26.075 --> 02:37:28.637]  It's, you know, they blew up the towers.
[02:37:28.637 --> 02:37:33.681]  And I think that, that Bin Laden was in contact with the CIA up until 9-11.
[02:37:33.681 --> 02:37:35.623]  And I think that this happened.
[02:37:35.623 --> 02:37:38.245]  And I think then it's like, no, no guys, no.
[02:37:38.245 --> 02:37:39.125]  Read the letter.
[02:37:39.125 --> 02:37:42.468]  You know, be responsible journalists.
[02:37:42.468 --> 02:37:43.949]  Read the frickin' letter.
[02:37:43.949 --> 02:37:45.110]  And let's talk about that.
[02:37:45.791 --> 02:38:02.505]  If they've got a drudge of all types of stuff, you know, real or imagined, whatever, you know, let's for a second maybe, you know, peek into the closets of some of these knuckleheads and see what skeletons lurk amongst their debris, you know?
[02:38:03.097 --> 02:38:20.302]  Well, that's the issue, is that on these shows they say, Charlie Sheen says this, Charlie Sheen said that, and they're making up fake quotes when you deliberately, in your statements on this show and in the letter, said, I just want you to answer these questions.
[02:38:20.302 --> 02:38:26.844]  Six of the ten say there should be a new investigation, and their answer is, every family hates you, Charlie.
[02:38:26.844 --> 02:38:28.024]  You're hurting the families.
[02:38:28.564 --> 02:38:38.069]  They continue to use that tired excuse as a shield, as you often put it, you know?
[02:38:38.069 --> 02:38:41.390]  And it's just, it's so shameful.
[02:38:43.593 --> 02:38:46.815]  It's just so unacceptable on so many fronts.
[02:39:02.965 --> 02:39:07.268]  To do this, and like a true hero, you never talk about it.
[02:39:07.268 --> 02:39:12.451]  You know, all the stuff that was made up about you before, you were told, shut up, we're going to make up a bunch of crap, and they did.
[02:39:12.451 --> 02:39:19.095]  You know, in the nastiest way, and going after Cuban, now in the New York Times, the White House calling him.
[02:39:19.095 --> 02:39:31.983]  I mean, this is heavy gangsters you're going up against, and you've gone through all of this, and you've come out smelling like a rose, because the people know the media lies and spins, and what I want you to speak to next is,
[02:39:33.385 --> 02:39:41.950]  You put out the challenge to John McCain's daughter and all these people, and they're afraid to debate you.
[02:39:41.950 --> 02:39:46.932]  I haven't heard anything back thus far, and we issued the challenge when, Alex?
[02:39:46.932 --> 02:39:47.933]  Last Friday.
[02:39:47.933 --> 02:39:48.793]  Last Friday.
[02:39:48.793 --> 02:39:52.675]  Yeah, alright, so we'll give them a weekend, you know, they were busy, whatever.
[02:39:52.675 --> 02:39:59.239]  But, yeah, no, we haven't, my PR team has not received any calls.
[02:39:59.239 --> 02:40:01.420]  You haven't received any calls, I haven't received any calls.
[02:40:03.643 --> 02:40:11.164]  It just seems, uh, it seems, you know, very glaring, in my opinion, that, uh, what have they got to hide?
[02:40:11.164 --> 02:40:13.545]  What are they so afraid of?
[02:40:13.545 --> 02:40:23.467]  Let me just read one thing from the letter, Alex, that these, uh, you know, these talking heads, these talking pinheads need to, uh, need to be made aware of.
[02:40:23.467 --> 02:40:31.108]  Um, please keep in mind, Mr. President, everything I'm about to say is documented as fact and part of the public record.
[02:40:31.721 --> 02:40:37.363]  The information you are holding in your hands chronicles and verifies each and every point.
[02:40:37.363 --> 02:40:48.267]  Now, would you and I have written a statement like that just prior to the briefing if we didn't feel it was absolutely bulletproof and stood completely on its own?
[02:40:49.497 --> 02:40:50.618]  No, we wouldn't have.
[02:40:50.618 --> 02:40:52.759]  And now that is in the White House hands.
[02:40:52.759 --> 02:40:53.880]  Gibbs has it.
[02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:54.901]  They've called you back.
[02:40:54.901 --> 02:40:55.741]  You've talked to them.
[02:40:55.741 --> 02:40:57.122]  We have their emails.
[02:40:57.122 --> 02:40:59.604]  We didn't publish their emails or phone calls back to you.
[02:40:59.604 --> 02:41:08.090]  We published your emails to them, you know, out of respect to privacy, even though it's a public office of the White House Press Secretary Gibbs.
[02:41:08.090 --> 02:41:12.453]  Here you are saying, I'd like to meet with you with the 9-11 families.
[02:41:12.453 --> 02:41:14.614]  You're in contact with the 9-11 families.
[02:41:14.614 --> 02:41:18.117]  Here you are saying, I'd like to debate and
[02:41:19.036 --> 02:41:33.683]  On top of that, Larry King was hot to have you on, but he said we've got to have somebody on the other side, and then Larry King called you up last week and I said, look, we can find no one to debate Charlie Sheen.
[02:41:33.683 --> 02:41:34.544]  It's incredible.
[02:41:34.544 --> 02:41:40.967]  Which, yeah, which doesn't really support their whole argument, because I'm a complete nutbag.
[02:41:40.967 --> 02:41:45.769]  I'm crazy, quote unquote.
[02:41:45.769 --> 02:41:47.770]  I have, what did Mustache call me?
[02:41:48.925 --> 02:41:53.007]  Mustache called me, he said I had a trick gene.
[02:41:53.007 --> 02:41:53.767]  Yes.
[02:41:53.767 --> 02:41:57.509]  Do we even, do we know what a trick gene is, Alex?
[02:41:57.509 --> 02:42:04.272]  I think you gotta have a trick gene to be able to grow a Stromboli mustache.
[02:42:04.272 --> 02:42:08.154]  Get your science team on that right away.
[02:42:08.154 --> 02:42:15.838]  So if Stromboli is going to attack me with a trick gene, shouldn't he be held responsible for at least explaining what that means?
[02:42:16.971 --> 02:42:22.195]  Well, that's... Or are we giving him too much airtime and too much credit?
[02:42:22.195 --> 02:42:31.141]  Well, you know, Geraldo Rivera is a joke in his own right, and all he did was use lies, innuendos, say you were hurting the families.
[02:42:31.141 --> 02:42:31.702]  The families
[02:42:33.737 --> 02:42:35.078]  Almost to a person.
[02:42:35.078 --> 02:42:40.541]  The news says over 75% didn't like the commission and said it was a fraud and cover-up.
[02:42:40.541 --> 02:42:45.344]  There's all those famous photos and videos of them holding up signs saying cover-up.
[02:42:45.344 --> 02:42:54.790]  And they're up there knowing that's the case, lying and claiming they represent the families and then saying you're hurting the families.
[02:42:54.790 --> 02:42:59.933]  When it was Bush that blocked the families being able to sue Saudi Arabia for that connection.
[02:42:59.933 --> 02:43:02.075]  That brings me to another point you made off-air.
[02:43:03.395 --> 02:43:08.659]  And that's about Hollywood and their so-called anti-war stance.
[02:43:08.659 --> 02:43:21.868]  Yeah, it just seemed a little hypocritical, in my book at least, that everybody is so outspoken against the war, but they seem like they're forgetting the reason that the war began.
[02:43:21.868 --> 02:43:28.092]  It seems like they're forgetting what had to take place prior to both wars being launched.
[02:43:29.497 --> 02:43:39.027]  So I don't feel, uh, I'm not saying like I can't handle this down here on my own because I went into the fire and, uh, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm ready to carry the flag.
[02:43:39.027 --> 02:43:40.169]  I'm ready to deliver the message.
[02:43:40.169 --> 02:43:45.514]  I'm ready to do whatever I have to do to keep the fight going, to keep this, you know, to keep focus on the issue.
[02:43:45.514 --> 02:43:50.260]  Um, but I just, um, yeah, it might've been nice that somebody came forward and said, I got your back, bro.
[02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:50.940]  I got your back.
[02:43:50.940 --> 02:43:51.381]  But, um,
[02:43:52.236 --> 02:43:56.101]  You know, I guess everybody's too worried about the things they're worried about, and you know what?
[02:43:56.101 --> 02:44:00.727]  They're absolutely entitled to take that position.
[02:44:00.727 --> 02:44:06.855]  I'm not saying I respect it, I'm not saying I disrespect it, but to say I wasn't slightly disappointed would be a lie.
[02:44:08.703 --> 02:44:10.844]  Well, sometimes it takes time.
[02:44:10.844 --> 02:44:16.705]  I mean, you saw Jesse Ventura, Willie Nelson, a lot of other people go public after you went public.
[02:44:16.705 --> 02:44:17.705]  Sure.
[02:44:17.705 --> 02:44:21.766]  And we don't know that Hollywood people haven't made a statement to the media.
[02:44:21.766 --> 02:44:24.967]  The media is trying to clamp this down, Charlie.
[02:44:24.967 --> 02:44:25.767]  Yeah.
[02:44:25.767 --> 02:44:26.827]  Yeah, I guess you're right.
[02:44:26.827 --> 02:44:27.568]  Yeah.
[02:44:27.568 --> 02:44:33.649]  So I think there could have been those that came forward that just the message was not delivered, you know?
[02:44:35.814 --> 02:44:43.537]  Well, I happen to know for a fact that there are some other big Hollywood people who have made little statements here and there, but they haven't boldly come out on the radio.
[02:44:43.537 --> 02:44:46.398]  They haven't made a public statement to the President.
[02:44:46.398 --> 02:44:48.839]  And I think that's why you are a hero, Charlie.
[02:44:48.839 --> 02:44:49.859]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[02:44:49.859 --> 02:44:51.860]  I mean, I don't look at myself like that.
[02:44:51.860 --> 02:44:53.021]  Honestly, I don't.
[02:44:53.021 --> 02:44:58.723]  I'm not sitting back here, like, you know, studying Google and every single story.
[02:44:58.723 --> 02:45:01.284]  I'm not, you know, basking in what I've done.
[02:45:01.284 --> 02:45:03.825]  I just, you know, I feel like I have a responsibility.
[02:45:05.118 --> 02:45:19.224]  Um, to, to, to, you know, use my platform, use my position, use my voice, and represent those that don't have that platform, that don't have the ability to reach the amount of people that I do.
[02:45:19.224 --> 02:45:26.708]  And, um, you know, last time I checked, that was my God-given right in this country as a law-abiding, tax-paying American.
[02:45:26.708 --> 02:45:28.449]  Well, that's another issue.
[02:45:28.449 --> 02:45:30.009]  Last time I checked.
[02:45:30.009 --> 02:45:33.691]  But I guess, you know, I guess the clock is ticking on that front as well.
[02:45:34.605 --> 02:45:51.815]  But wait a minute, Alex, let's talk for two seconds about the President finds the time to comment on this ridiculous Kanye West thing at a music award show, and then, you know, they have to call and apologize to the White House because it was something set off the record.
[02:45:51.815 --> 02:46:04.263]  It's like a whole big thing, but he doesn't even acknowledge that this letter was presented, the video was produced and launched on YouTube that's blown up, you know, in the last
[02:46:04.656 --> 02:46:06.137]  Four or five days.
[02:46:06.137 --> 02:46:18.767]  He doesn't even have the decency, the compassion, the executive awareness to just make one comment about this, just so we know that he's read it, that he cares, that he doesn't care, something.
[02:46:18.767 --> 02:46:23.791]  Just let us know where you stand, Mr. President, because, you know, I didn't do this.
[02:46:23.791 --> 02:46:27.994]  I didn't do this just to, you know, suddenly put myself back in the news, you know?
[02:46:29.187 --> 02:46:35.029]  In fact, the media has reported one of the most private people in Hollywood turned down interviews constantly.
[02:46:35.029 --> 02:46:39.350]  I was talking to your publicist, Larry King, trying to get you every week.
[02:46:39.350 --> 02:46:41.310]  You've refused for year after year.
[02:46:41.310 --> 02:46:47.092]  You suddenly say, OK, I'm ready to come on and talk about 9-11, and you can have three people against me.
[02:46:47.092 --> 02:46:50.233]  And even three to one, they can't get them to come on.
[02:46:51.033 --> 02:46:51.273]  Exactly.
[02:46:51.273 --> 02:46:54.996]  I mean, I don't drink, but I don't see why he and I couldn't recreate the, you know,
[02:47:21.314 --> 02:47:26.137]  Rose Garden beer meeting, you know?
[02:47:26.137 --> 02:47:31.660]  Well, you could have a buckler, like one of the guys that doesn't drink did.
[02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:34.742]  Exactly.
[02:47:34.742 --> 02:47:39.824]  But again, you know, obviously at this point, everybody knows that we're not hiding.
[02:47:39.824 --> 02:47:40.945]  We're here to make a statement.
[02:47:40.945 --> 02:47:49.630]  We're here to confront, you know, an issue and issues that have been ignored and steamrolled and completely
[02:47:51.147 --> 02:47:56.193]  Devastated for much too long, and it's time to be accountable.
[02:47:56.193 --> 02:47:57.094]  It's time to step up.
[02:47:57.094 --> 02:47:57.915]  It's time to step forward.
[02:47:57.915 --> 02:48:01.079]  It's time to, you know, put this thing back on the front burner.
[02:48:01.079 --> 02:48:06.145]  And it's time to demand the truth, you know?
[02:48:06.145 --> 02:48:07.407]  That's what it's really about.
[02:48:07.407 --> 02:48:09.389]  It's really about right here, right now.
[02:48:09.389 --> 02:48:10.731]  What can we do right here, right now?
[02:48:11.397 --> 02:48:16.621]  Well, you and I have talked a lot about why you wanted to go public, and it's the same reason I go public.
[02:48:16.621 --> 02:48:20.544]  How do you know 6 of the 10 commissioners say it's a fraud and a cover-up?
[02:48:20.544 --> 02:48:24.927]  How do you know the White House was involved covering it up?
[02:48:24.927 --> 02:48:32.953]  How do you know that FBI translators said the government was running al-Qaeda and bin Laden up until the day of the attack, 9-11?
[02:48:32.953 --> 02:48:37.577]  How do you know NORAD stood down and then just go, oh, I'm going to go on about my life
[02:48:38.697 --> 02:48:51.488]  They've staged Gulf of Tonkin, Cheney wanted to blow up our own ships, this whole history, and then we're supposed to just sit back and ignore it, and that's completely abnormal to be able just to ignore this.
[02:48:51.488 --> 02:48:52.309]  It is.
[02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:53.069]  It is.
[02:48:53.069 --> 02:49:01.156]  But unfortunately, they've created the illusion that there's no other option.
[02:49:01.156 --> 02:49:07.281]  That is the only way to behave, that is the only way to think, and anybody that dares defy that is labeled a nutjob.
[02:49:08.203 --> 02:49:12.185]  No, I'm sorry.
[02:49:12.185 --> 02:49:15.026]  That's not good enough.
[02:49:15.026 --> 02:49:20.788]  That's not what free-thinking people were taught.
[02:49:20.788 --> 02:49:25.450]  Those aren't the ideals we were raised on.
[02:49:25.450 --> 02:49:32.573]  Charlie, when we come back, we've got a big announcement to make, and we've got a few other issues to cover in the time we have with you today.
[02:49:34.229 --> 02:49:36.491]  Just asking you live here on air.
[02:49:36.491 --> 02:49:48.040]  From my perspective, it's been a huge success with your video message, 20 Minutes of the President, published by hundreds of newspapers, links to it, some papers printed the whole thing, some your 20 bullet points.
[02:49:48.040 --> 02:49:57.868]  It's reignited a huge debate about false flag terror, and I think really keeps the establishment from trying to pull something like this again.
[02:49:57.868 --> 02:49:59.830]  Are you happy with what's happened overall?
[02:49:59.830 --> 02:50:01.331]  I'm thrilled, Alex.
[02:50:01.331 --> 02:50:01.851]  I'm thrilled.
[02:50:04.358 --> 02:50:07.820]  You know, phase one is a major success.
[02:50:07.820 --> 02:50:14.364]  But, you know, to be thrilled and not satisfied is a little frustrating, to be honest, you know?
[02:50:14.364 --> 02:50:16.665]  Because I didn't start this.
[02:50:16.665 --> 02:50:24.410]  I didn't, you know, roll this snowball downhill to have it just be this, you know?
[02:50:24.410 --> 02:50:32.255]  This is the ultimate goal, is to sit down with the man, is to get 20 minutes of face time with POTUS.
[02:50:33.223 --> 02:50:35.485]  That's what this is about.
[02:50:35.485 --> 02:50:38.627]  20 minutes with Possum, I mean POTUS.
[02:50:38.627 --> 02:50:39.448]  Yes.
[02:50:39.448 --> 02:50:42.330]  Charlie Sheen is our guest.
[02:50:42.330 --> 02:50:45.233]  Phase 1 has been launched.
[02:50:45.233 --> 02:50:49.676]  We're gonna let you know a little bit about Phase 2, but there's more coming up down the road as well.
[02:50:49.676 --> 02:50:55.881]  Charlie Sheen is our guest, and you, my friends, are essential in Phase 2.
[02:50:55.881 --> 02:50:58.343]  Even more important than you were in Phase 1.
[02:50:58.343 --> 02:50:58.844]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.311 --> 02:51:05.054]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-dry guide.
[02:51:05.054 --> 02:51:12.219]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[02:51:12.219 --> 02:51:17.243]  You should only store what you usually eat, because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[02:51:17.523 --> 02:51:19.465]  Lucky for you, there's the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[02:51:19.465 --> 02:51:26.090]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[02:51:26.090 --> 02:51:31.033]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[02:51:31.033 --> 02:51:40.381]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[02:51:40.381 --> 02:51:47.046]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[02:51:47.366 --> 02:51:49.047]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:51:49.047 --> 02:51:52.450]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:51:52.450 --> 02:51:54.512]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:51:54.512 --> 02:51:57.294]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:51:57.294 --> 02:51:59.376]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[02:52:15.165 --> 02:52:15.525]  I don't know.
[02:52:40.424 --> 02:52:49.449]  From tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library, my weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[02:52:49.449 --> 02:52:52.311]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[02:52:52.311 --> 02:52:54.392]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:52:54.392 --> 02:52:56.374]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[02:52:56.374 --> 02:52:58.535]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[02:52:58.535 --> 02:53:00.336]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:53:00.336 --> 02:53:01.077]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:53:02.643 --> 02:53:03.303]  Attention!
[02:53:03.303 --> 02:53:18.672]  An important product from hempusa.org, Micro Plant Powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[02:53:18.672 --> 02:53:20.092]  Micro Plant Powder is 89% silica.
[02:53:21.713 --> 02:53:21.894]  I'm good.
[02:53:36.954 --> 02:53:37.194]  I think so.
[02:54:13.422 --> 02:54:15.063]  Charlie Sheen, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:15.063 --> 02:54:20.186]  He looks at 9-11, the unanswered questions, he looks at his family, he decides to go public.
[02:54:20.186 --> 02:54:21.527]  An intensely private person.
[02:54:21.527 --> 02:54:22.367]  But he's doing it because
[02:54:39.036 --> 02:54:41.397]  You can't sleep at night unless he does.
[02:54:41.397 --> 02:54:43.138]  A man after my own heart.
[02:54:43.138 --> 02:54:47.260]  Charlie's gonna be with us 20 minutes into the next hour.
[02:54:47.260 --> 02:54:49.001]  I just cleared the phones.
[02:54:49.001 --> 02:54:50.902]  Your chance to talk to him about 9-11, 9-11 Truth, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:50.902 --> 02:54:54.503]  Your questions or comments for Charlie Sheen coming up when we start the next hour.
[02:54:54.503 --> 02:54:55.644]  Charlie, I noticed here in your letter
[02:55:09.230 --> 02:55:10.991]  Your open letter to the public.
[02:55:10.991 --> 02:55:13.893]  You say another Bin Laden tape has surfaced this morning.
[02:55:13.893 --> 02:55:26.000]  I will be monitoring the FBI's Most Wanted website to see if this tape finally provides the Bureau with the evidence required to list him for the crime of 9-11 on his rap sheet.
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:27.661]  Thus far, it has not.
[02:55:27.661 --> 02:55:29.962]  Yeah.
[02:55:29.962 --> 02:55:31.543]  Yeah.
[02:55:31.543 --> 02:55:33.665]  It's still not up.
[02:55:33.665 --> 02:55:34.285]  It's still not up.
[02:55:36.158 --> 02:55:43.681]  So, it doesn't really make any sense to keep rolling out these tapes, video, audio, whatever, and, um, it doesn't seem to, uh...
[02:55:45.433 --> 02:55:47.675]  It doesn't seem to connect him to anything.
[02:55:47.675 --> 02:55:54.820]  He keeps coming out in these fake videos that have been proven to be fake, and now audios, admitting he carried it out.
[02:55:54.820 --> 02:56:01.444]  If they have him listed and indicted for the coal and the embassy bombings in Africa, why not for 9-11?
[02:56:01.444 --> 02:56:04.106]  Because the FBI says they don't have the evidence!
[02:56:04.106 --> 02:56:04.727]  Yeah.
[02:56:04.727 --> 02:56:09.550]  Yeah, no, it really confuses the whole issue.
[02:56:09.550 --> 02:56:10.711]  It confuses the whole issue.
[02:56:10.711 --> 02:56:13.913]  You know, there's a reason that that was the first bullet point on the list.
[02:56:16.943 --> 02:56:24.609]  Because I've been in conversation, and I've told people, I said, you know, if you visit the FBI's most wanted, you look up at Lonnie, and then 9-11 is just not mentioned.
[02:56:24.609 --> 02:56:25.990]  They're like, oh, that's not true.
[02:56:25.990 --> 02:56:31.894]  And then you walk them over to a computer, you bring it up, and they sit there dumbfounded.
[02:56:31.894 --> 02:56:34.316]  You know?
[02:56:34.316 --> 02:56:44.323]  And, you know, I would like to believe that because of the letter, hopefully in certain situations, that it led people to do just that.
[02:56:44.323 --> 02:56:45.604]  It led them to go check.
[02:56:46.237 --> 02:56:58.216]  Well Charlie, there is no doubt, and Paul Watson concurs, and he talked about this last hour, you had them doing 9-11 hit pieces against us in the last few months, you had
[02:56:59.301 --> 02:57:06.186]  You had POTUS starting to invoke 9-11 as the pretext to increase troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and contractors.
[02:57:06.186 --> 02:57:10.690]  And then you have more warrantless raids of innocent people.
[02:57:10.690 --> 02:57:14.613]  It came out Cheney did that and wanted to use the army just to create fear.
[02:57:14.613 --> 02:57:15.593]  That's been declassified.
[02:57:16.454 --> 02:57:34.222]  And you have this Ben Lawton tape coming out from the Intel Center who's been caught uploading past ones with the Intel Center logo in the same video layer as the Al-Qaeda logo, meaning they produced it.
[02:57:34.222 --> 02:57:35.262]  Yeah.
[02:57:35.262 --> 02:57:36.803]  Are we surprised?
[02:57:36.803 --> 02:57:37.423]  Are we shocked?
[02:57:37.423 --> 02:57:39.004]  Are we dumbfounded?
[02:57:39.004 --> 02:57:42.045]  I mean, it's what these people do.
[02:57:44.585 --> 02:57:50.006]  Well, how do you like having the Pentagon release a new video trying to overshadow your going public?
[02:57:50.006 --> 02:57:54.927]  Well, I mean, I don't want to take credit that that was their response.
[02:57:54.927 --> 02:57:58.327]  I mean, it seems like the timing is a little suspect, a little convenient, perhaps.
[02:57:58.327 --> 02:58:01.188]  Well, they make national TV shows attacking us, bro.
[02:58:01.188 --> 02:58:01.908]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:58:01.908 --> 02:58:02.348]  That's true.
[02:58:02.348 --> 02:58:11.850]  Yeah, no, they... I think that, you know, if perhaps it wasn't a coincidence, then... then, gosh, it...
[02:58:13.095 --> 02:58:22.837]  You know, I would have to say, to quote my dad from Apocalypse, that we really shoved a weed up Command's ass, you know?
[02:58:22.837 --> 02:58:24.978]  Oh man, you are something else, Charlie Sheen.
[02:58:24.978 --> 02:58:30.879]  We're gonna go to break, come back, take some calls, and get into other points with Charlie.
[02:58:30.879 --> 02:58:38.901]  There's so many to make, but we want to thank all of you that made this a big success, that got 20 Minutes with the President out there to tens of millions.
[02:58:38.901 --> 02:58:39.561]  Keep spreading it.
[02:58:43.416 --> 02:58:45.922]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.922 --> 02:58:48.246]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:51.377 --> 02:58:56.340]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:59:21.397 --> 02:59:21.917]  We're good.
[02:59:54.085 --> 02:59:56.470]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.470 --> 02:59:59.195]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:14.542 --> 03:00:17.883]  Okay, we're going to take your phone calls for Charlie Sheen.
[03:00:17.883 --> 03:00:20.104]  In the next segment, we've got a big announcement.
[03:00:20.104 --> 03:00:25.666]  The next phase in our operation to get 9-11 Truth out there on the front burner.
[03:00:25.666 --> 03:00:29.707]  Charlie, thanks to you spreading the word, has been successful in phase one.
[03:00:29.707 --> 03:00:31.708]  Help us with phase two.
[03:00:31.708 --> 03:00:33.969]  Quickly, Mark in Oregon.
[03:00:33.969 --> 03:00:35.849]  You're on the air with Charlie Sheen.
[03:00:35.849 --> 03:00:37.310]  Go ahead, Mark.
[03:00:37.310 --> 03:00:38.730]  Yeah, good morning, Alex.
[03:00:38.730 --> 03:00:39.651]  Good morning, Charlie.
[03:00:39.651 --> 03:00:40.471]  Hey, Mark, how are you, man?
[03:00:41.204 --> 03:00:42.465]  Oh man, I'm doing pretty good.
[03:00:42.465 --> 03:00:55.996]  I'm doing better, you know, each day since you, uh, with Alex's great assistance have really taken off with, uh, what I see is actually implementing what is the most powerful tool available to us at this time, Charlie.
[03:00:55.996 --> 03:01:05.944]  And I think you may be aware of this to, uh, strike at the heart of evil with the facts of truth of the air for, and that is the vehicle of publicity, the tool of publicity
[03:01:06.510 --> 03:01:11.072]  That is extremely powerful, and when you've lent your name to the facts of truth, Charlie, you have
[03:01:11.698 --> 03:01:15.919]  Supercharged the publicity, which has always been available to the Infowar.
[03:01:15.919 --> 03:01:19.500]  It all depended how far all of the Infowarriors have wanted to go.
[03:01:19.500 --> 03:01:24.061]  And it's an ongoing condition as to how much we implement of what is available to us.
[03:01:24.061 --> 03:01:27.681]  But the facts of the truth create tremendous publicity.
[03:01:27.681 --> 03:01:29.562]  And just God bless you, sir.
[03:01:29.562 --> 03:01:30.522]  And I'm sure he does.
[03:01:30.522 --> 03:01:34.383]  And I really appreciate everything that you're doing and everything you've done, Charles.
[03:01:34.383 --> 03:01:35.123]  Thank you, Mark.
[03:01:35.123 --> 03:01:35.843]  Thank you, Mark.
[03:01:35.843 --> 03:01:36.763]  Thank you so much.
[03:01:36.763 --> 03:01:39.084]  Wow, that's really powerful.
[03:01:39.084 --> 03:01:39.404]  Thank you.
[03:01:39.929 --> 03:01:44.310]  Let me throw a point in here on this issue.
[03:01:44.310 --> 03:01:48.011]  The mainstream media keeps going, he's an actor, why didn't he just shut up?
[03:01:48.011 --> 03:01:49.932]  A, you're an American citizen.
[03:01:49.932 --> 03:01:51.953]  B, you're a father.
[03:01:51.953 --> 03:01:55.714]  C, you've been a director, writer, a very accomplished person.
[03:01:55.714 --> 03:01:57.434]  Ronald Reagan was an actor.
[03:01:57.434 --> 03:01:58.975]  Hey, good point.
[03:01:58.975 --> 03:02:01.976]  The governor of California is an actor.
[03:02:01.976 --> 03:02:04.456]  That's a load of crap.
[03:02:04.456 --> 03:02:06.437]  They just wish they were Charlie Sheen.
[03:02:08.052 --> 03:02:09.933]  Well, I mean, you can say that, Alex.
[03:02:09.933 --> 03:02:16.356]  I, of course, can't, but... No, but I think it's interesting.
[03:02:16.356 --> 03:02:29.821]  What Mark said is that they abuse the media that they so irresponsibly control, and... Sorry, there's a jet.
[03:02:29.821 --> 03:02:33.523]  And I'm trying to utilize it in a more responsible fashion, you know?
[03:02:35.199 --> 03:02:43.743]  Well, look, just outside the paradigm, you're deviating from the false reality and they don't want you to say, look, the emperor's wearing no clothes.
[03:02:43.743 --> 03:02:44.724]  Exactly.
[03:02:44.724 --> 03:02:51.547]  I mean, listen, what you've done seismic, it's going to continue to have effects for years, much bigger than last time you went public.
[03:02:51.547 --> 03:02:56.089]  I mean, it's already probably 10 times more media attention than 2006.
[03:02:56.089 --> 03:02:59.211]  But I'm here to tell you, buddy, this is going to have seismic effects.
[03:02:59.491 --> 03:03:00.332]  I hope so, Alex.
[03:03:00.332 --> 03:03:00.792]  I hope so.
[03:03:00.792 --> 03:03:07.237]  And what I'm really proud of and what I'm really excited about is the fact that now there's a document.
[03:03:07.237 --> 03:03:12.540]  I have delivered a document that is ingrained into the landscape of the movement.
[03:03:12.540 --> 03:03:21.747]  And now people that, you know, perhaps couldn't focus the argument now have a document to lay in front of their doubters and say, okay, you don't want to listen to me?
[03:03:21.747 --> 03:03:22.948]  Just read this.
[03:03:22.948 --> 03:03:23.688]  Just look at this.
[03:03:23.688 --> 03:03:25.129]  Let's talk about number one.
[03:03:25.129 --> 03:03:26.510]  Let's talk about number seven.
[03:03:26.510 --> 03:03:27.431]  Let's talk about number nine.
[03:03:28.089 --> 03:03:29.652]  Debate me on number 14.
[03:03:29.652 --> 03:03:30.914]  Let's talk about development.
[03:03:30.914 --> 03:03:32.536]  Let's just talk about these things.
[03:03:32.536 --> 03:03:42.392]  And it's just, I think we've given them a real powerful tool that now exists in the pantheon of this historical movement.
[03:03:43.442 --> 03:03:45.304]  And it had to be novel.
[03:03:45.304 --> 03:03:49.067]  Just another 20 points, another research article, no one would have read it.
[03:03:49.067 --> 03:04:09.644]  But Charlie Sheen, combined with another celebrity, Barack Obama, in this debate, in this discussion, with the links, the American people became the president, and Charlie Sheen was giving the American people and the people of the world the two folders of the data, and now tens of millions have read it.
[03:04:10.405 --> 03:04:16.968]  The genius, the brilliance of that to get those 20 points out is unparalleled.
[03:04:16.968 --> 03:04:18.809]  Well, Alex, you are much too kind.
[03:04:18.809 --> 03:04:19.449]  Thank you.
[03:04:19.449 --> 03:04:20.169]  Thank you.
[03:04:20.169 --> 03:04:36.336]  I don't know if I would call it, you know, brilliant or genius, but I think it was, I just, I had faith in the theatrical aspect of it, getting people interested and then delivering them to the facts.
[03:04:36.786 --> 03:04:42.189]  Well, Charlie, for five, six days, it's been the number one 9-11 story, not all their lies and propaganda.
[03:04:42.189 --> 03:04:43.610]  They are scared.
[03:04:43.610 --> 03:04:45.111]  I mean, it's huge.
[03:04:45.111 --> 03:04:49.794]  It dwarfs anything I've ever been involved in, no doubt.
[03:04:49.794 --> 03:04:52.436]  It's published in papers all over the world.
[03:04:52.436 --> 03:04:57.399]  This is the biggest single strike for 9-11 truth against the lie we've ever seen.
[03:05:01.684 --> 03:05:04.686]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.686 --> 03:05:10.031]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.031 --> 03:05:12.072]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.072 --> 03:05:17.076]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.076 --> 03:05:17.997]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.257 --> 03:05:19.377]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.377 --> 03:05:21.258]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.258 --> 03:05:22.339]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.339 --> 03:05:24.539]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.539 --> 03:05:25.880]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.880 --> 03:05:27.401]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.401 --> 03:05:32.683]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.683 --> 03:05:35.804]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.244 --> 03:05:40.065]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.065 --> 03:05:41.285]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.285 --> 03:05:42.206]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.206 --> 03:05:43.306]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.306 --> 03:05:44.226]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.226 --> 03:05:45.326]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.326 --> 03:05:48.367]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.367 --> 03:05:50.167]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.167 --> 03:05:51.068]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.683 --> 03:06:06.010]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:06.010 --> 03:06:08.073]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[03:06:08.073 --> 03:06:10.536]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.536 --> 03:06:12.799]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.799 --> 03:06:14.441]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.441 --> 03:06:15.463]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.683 --> 03:06:24.107]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:07:00.984 --> 03:07:05.330]  ...guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:07:05.330 --> 03:07:07.893]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:07:07.893 --> 03:07:17.346]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:07:17.346 --> 03:07:17.787]  We're good to go.
[03:07:36.529 --> 03:07:37.070]  I think so.
[03:08:06.334 --> 03:08:11.175]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:08:11.175 --> 03:08:12.755]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.755 --> 03:08:14.296]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.296 --> 03:08:18.497]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.497 --> 03:08:24.818]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:24.818 --> 03:08:31.039]  Charlie Sheen is going to be with us to the bottom of this hour.
[03:08:31.039 --> 03:08:33.960]  And I want to be clear, when I talk about his courage and how much I admire him,
[03:08:35.486 --> 03:08:39.707]  You have to realize the sacrifices he's made to go public and expose this.
[03:08:39.707 --> 03:08:41.368]  And it is the courage that I admire.
[03:08:57.819 --> 03:09:06.922]  Says Bin Laden is wanted in connection with the August 7th, 1998 bombings of the United States embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya.
[03:09:06.922 --> 03:09:08.623]  These attacks killed over 200 people.
[03:09:08.623 --> 03:09:12.444]  In addition, Bin Laden is a suspect in other terrorist attacks throughout the world.
[03:09:12.444 --> 03:09:17.125]  And at the top, it says he's wanted for attacking Americans abroad.
[03:09:17.125 --> 03:09:18.986]  So there it is!
[03:09:18.986 --> 03:09:21.207]  And the FBI's been questioned by the press.
[03:09:21.207 --> 03:09:21.827]  We have links to that.
[03:09:21.827 --> 03:09:24.668]  And they say because we don't have evidence, he carried it out.
[03:09:26.111 --> 03:09:27.492]  Charlie Sheen is our guest.
[03:09:27.492 --> 03:09:30.334]  These are one of the questions that Charlie Sheen is asking.
[03:09:30.334 --> 03:09:34.936]  I'm actually looking at his page also, Alex.
[03:09:34.936 --> 03:09:46.102]  It would seem after yesterday's audio tape that it would have jumped on here, but I guess it didn't.
[03:09:46.102 --> 03:09:54.827]  Not to mention that the prior 20 or 30 tapes didn't deliver him as a battle of the suspect as well.
[03:09:57.982 --> 03:09:59.424]  I mean, how do you argue this?
[03:09:59.424 --> 03:10:01.626]  You know what, Alex?
[03:10:01.626 --> 03:10:06.671]  Let's jump on the other side for one second, okay?
[03:10:06.671 --> 03:10:07.172]  Okay.
[03:10:07.172 --> 03:10:08.073]  Can we do that?
[03:10:08.073 --> 03:10:08.933]  Let's do it.
[03:10:08.933 --> 03:10:12.277]  Can we lobotomize ourselves for one second?
[03:10:12.277 --> 03:10:12.777]  Okay.
[03:10:12.777 --> 03:10:15.140]  And jump on the other side?
[03:10:15.140 --> 03:10:16.541]  What's the argument for this?
[03:10:16.541 --> 03:10:19.044]  Just come at me in any, you know, intelligent,
[03:10:21.917 --> 03:10:27.560]  Well, we've already indicted him for other bombings, so we're not going to list killing 3,000 people on it.
[03:10:27.560 --> 03:10:30.981]  Okay, that's not going to hold up in a court of law.
[03:10:30.981 --> 03:10:32.522]  What's the next argument?
[03:10:32.522 --> 03:10:39.344]  We're so busy trying to protect you from Al-Qaeda, we don't have time to indict him.
[03:10:39.344 --> 03:10:42.385]  And if you indict him, Al-Qaeda's going to nuke a major city.
[03:10:42.385 --> 03:10:43.226]  That's what Cheney said.
[03:10:46.949 --> 03:10:49.470]  And eight years later we can't find him.
[03:10:49.470 --> 03:11:03.394]  But all these CIA and military people say every time they had him in their sights they were ordered to stand down and the CIA flew 8,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda out to safety into Pakistan.
[03:11:03.394 --> 03:11:10.637]  And the FBI translator, yeah the airlift of evil, and the FBI translator says that they work for the CIA.
[03:11:10.637 --> 03:11:11.497]  No, no, no.
[03:11:11.497 --> 03:11:13.998]  I said that.
[03:11:13.998 --> 03:11:14.578]  I said that.
[03:11:15.373 --> 03:11:17.795]  Those were my words, remember?
[03:11:17.795 --> 03:11:18.175]  That's right.
[03:11:18.175 --> 03:11:21.477]  How dare you point out what the FBI whistleblower said.
[03:11:21.477 --> 03:11:22.037]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:11:22.037 --> 03:11:23.538]  He got the nerve of me.
[03:11:23.538 --> 03:11:25.139]  You said that to hurt the family.
[03:11:25.139 --> 03:11:25.640]  Of course.
[03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:27.201]  Of course.
[03:11:27.201 --> 03:11:28.181]  Crackpot actor.
[03:11:28.181 --> 03:11:29.863]  Yes.
[03:11:29.863 --> 03:11:32.744]  Like Ronald Reagan, the crackpot actor.
[03:11:32.744 --> 03:11:33.325]  Yes.
[03:11:33.325 --> 03:11:34.566]  He was a B actor.
[03:11:34.566 --> 03:11:36.087]  You're an A plus actor.
[03:11:36.087 --> 03:11:36.967]  Well, thank you.
[03:11:36.967 --> 03:11:42.251]  I'm sure there's a decent performance somewhere in his resume, but I don't think it occurred in his presidency.
[03:11:42.251 --> 03:11:43.792]  But that's another issue.
[03:11:44.403 --> 03:11:49.766]  The TV show sponsored by General Electric where he was friends with the monkey.
[03:11:49.766 --> 03:11:50.387]  That's the one.
[03:11:50.387 --> 03:11:58.011]  I'm not bashing Reagan, it's just that by the yardstick, if you're an actor, you're a piece of crap according to the media, then Ronald Reagan's bad.
[03:11:58.011 --> 03:11:59.272]  Yeah.
[03:11:59.272 --> 03:12:00.373]  Yes.
[03:12:00.373 --> 03:12:03.915]  And he would have been a three-termer if not for the limits.
[03:12:03.915 --> 03:12:07.817]  And of course, Schwarzenegger, we're not allowed to have him as a governor if he was an actor.
[03:12:07.817 --> 03:12:08.798]  Yes.
[03:12:08.798 --> 03:12:08.958]  Yeah.
[03:12:10.768 --> 03:12:14.089]  Charlie, I want to go to some more calls here and then make our big announcement.
[03:12:14.089 --> 03:12:14.649]  Okay, okay.
[03:12:14.649 --> 03:12:18.030]  Should we just make the big announcement now or take calls and then make it?
[03:12:18.030 --> 03:12:20.390]  Um, let's take a couple calls and then let's make it, yeah.
[03:12:20.390 --> 03:12:24.071]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Randy in Pennsylvania.
[03:12:24.071 --> 03:12:26.532]  Randy, you're on the air with Charlie Sheen.
[03:12:26.532 --> 03:12:35.454]  Alex Jones, Charlie Sheen, you two minute men, you two militiamen heroes rushing to the aid of your country and your families.
[03:12:35.454 --> 03:12:36.775]  God bless you.
[03:12:36.775 --> 03:12:37.435]  Thank you, sir.
[03:12:37.435 --> 03:12:37.735]  Thank you.
[03:12:38.311 --> 03:12:43.094]  Listen, Charlie, the forensics of 9-11 is undebatable.
[03:12:43.094 --> 03:12:44.855]  That's why they won't debate you.
[03:12:44.855 --> 03:12:46.777]  That's why they are delaying.
[03:12:46.777 --> 03:12:47.837]  They are planning.
[03:12:47.837 --> 03:12:50.079]  They are preparing.
[03:12:50.079 --> 03:12:51.880]  Well, just like you said, we're militiamen.
[03:12:51.880 --> 03:12:55.682]  He is actually Wolverine 1, and I am Wolverine 2.
[03:12:55.682 --> 03:12:56.763]  Amen.
[03:12:56.763 --> 03:12:57.784]  Amen.
[03:12:57.784 --> 03:13:07.010]  The time now, America, if you have any red blood in your body, is to continue the attack, because they are on the defensive.
[03:13:08.134 --> 03:13:09.074]  That's a good point, Al.
[03:13:09.074 --> 03:13:10.154]  That's a very good point.
[03:13:10.154 --> 03:13:15.735]  Well, I just want to add that if we don't expose false flag terror, they're going to stage more.
[03:13:15.735 --> 03:13:18.236]  So we are in a race here with time.
[03:13:18.236 --> 03:13:19.156]  Go ahead.
[03:13:19.156 --> 03:13:26.097]  That's the only thing they know to do, so they are going to do more false flag terror.
[03:13:26.097 --> 03:13:27.637]  That's undebatable.
[03:13:27.637 --> 03:13:30.618]  Do you have a question or a statement for Charlie or something you'd like to ask him?
[03:13:30.618 --> 03:13:35.379]  Yes, I want to talk about the taxpayer march on Washington in particular real quick.
[03:13:35.379 --> 03:13:36.759]  It was a failure.
[03:13:36.759 --> 03:13:36.999]  Why?
[03:13:38.353 --> 03:13:52.298]  It's wonderful to have a number of Americans stand up for their country and their rights, but the Rockefellers and the Republicans are the ones that will ultimately win if we're not careful.
[03:13:52.298 --> 03:13:53.798]  I'm going to go ahead and jump though.
[03:13:53.798 --> 03:13:54.739]  That's another subject.
[03:13:54.739 --> 03:13:56.399]  Thank you so much, Randy.
[03:13:56.399 --> 03:13:57.660]  Let's talk to John in Florida.
[03:13:57.660 --> 03:14:00.401]  You're on the air with Charlie Sheen.
[03:14:00.401 --> 03:14:04.502]  Hey, yeah, I really think that you two guys are shining.
[03:14:04.502 --> 03:14:07.343]  You know, we got to have some kind of commanders in the field there.
[03:14:07.847 --> 03:14:08.247]  We're good to go.
[03:14:22.193 --> 03:14:26.514]  Well that's right, make no mistake, the system is scared of what Charlie's done.
[03:14:26.514 --> 03:14:29.715]  The system is scared of what you did, carrying his 20 minutes.
[03:14:29.715 --> 03:14:33.216]  Keep spreading it, keep spreading his video message to the President.
[03:14:33.216 --> 03:14:37.277]  It's in the 20 minutes with the President link at the top of InfoWars.com.
[03:14:37.277 --> 03:14:40.158]  They are scared of your action, period.
[03:14:40.158 --> 03:14:41.238]  Charlie, comments to that.
[03:14:42.662 --> 03:14:54.326]  Well, yeah, but I can't do this alone, you know, and I'm not saying that I'm doing it alone, but we all have to take this as a call to action.
[03:14:54.326 --> 03:15:03.969]  We all have to stand up and just forge ahead and demand the truth and organize.
[03:15:05.280 --> 03:15:24.233]  In fact, let's have everybody, I'm not having another contest on this, but everybody should just put up 9-11 is an inside job, Infowars.com, or whatever website you like, posters up every week, put a couple up in your neighborhood, and just never stop until the whole country is covered with 9-11 was an inside job posters.
[03:15:24.233 --> 03:15:25.494]  How does that sound, Charlie?
[03:15:25.494 --> 03:15:27.295]  That sounds unbelievable.
[03:15:27.295 --> 03:15:28.316]  That sounds unbelievable.
[03:15:28.316 --> 03:15:32.418]  I mean, of course, they'll introduce new littering laws, but...
[03:15:34.011 --> 03:15:35.732]  Whatever, we will keep posting.
[03:15:35.732 --> 03:15:37.993]  Exposing these terrorists is what's important.
[03:15:37.993 --> 03:15:42.094]  Exactly, yeah.
[03:15:42.094 --> 03:15:49.617]  Just remember the groundswell is coming up and just keep trying to ride it and stay level with it and be the voices you are.
[03:15:49.617 --> 03:16:00.422]  And then when it's all over and you have like half a million people giving you a round of applause, both of you, and I want to turn around and say, that's when I'm going to salute the flag.
[03:16:01.394 --> 03:16:02.895]  God bless you, sir.
[03:16:02.895 --> 03:16:03.815]  Very powerful statement.
[03:16:03.815 --> 03:16:05.336]  Thank you, sir.
[03:16:05.336 --> 03:16:11.520]  It's come out that Cheney did want to blow up our own ship, so it's not impossible that this is going to come out.
[03:16:11.520 --> 03:16:12.641]  It's not impossible at all.
[03:16:13.689 --> 03:16:15.050]  That's why they're so scared.
[03:16:15.050 --> 03:16:21.493]  Charlie, before we take some more calls and come back and make the big announcement, you made the challenge last week in your own words.
[03:16:21.493 --> 03:16:30.217]  I mean, I'm not saying you should dance on the roof here, but what do you want to say to McCain's daughter and to O'Reilly and to Hannity and all those and this other pinhead?
[03:16:30.217 --> 03:16:33.459]  You've challenged them to a debate.
[03:16:33.459 --> 03:16:34.720]  And they are cowards.
[03:16:34.720 --> 03:16:36.901]  They will not let men face you.
[03:16:38.947 --> 03:16:42.069]  Uh, I, I, I, I, it doesn't make any sense.
[03:16:42.069 --> 03:16:44.690]  I mean, they, they've already got all the material.
[03:16:44.690 --> 03:16:45.710]  There's no surprises.
[03:16:45.710 --> 03:16:48.632]  I'm just coming out there with my letter.
[03:16:48.632 --> 03:16:49.912]  With the bullet points.
[03:16:49.912 --> 03:16:51.593]  Let's just, let's just focus on that.
[03:16:51.593 --> 03:16:51.873]  You know?
[03:16:51.873 --> 03:16:53.474]  Let's just focus on that.
[03:16:53.474 --> 03:16:54.394]  That's all.
[03:16:54.394 --> 03:16:55.935]  There's no surprises, guys.
[03:16:55.935 --> 03:16:57.055]  You know?
[03:16:57.055 --> 03:16:57.956]  There's no surprises.
[03:16:57.956 --> 03:17:03.298]  I mean, uh... I, uh, you know, we could appeal to their, um, to their egos.
[03:17:03.298 --> 03:17:04.939]  It might, uh, it might enhance their viewership.
[03:17:06.195 --> 03:17:09.258]  Well, obviously they know having you on would get them top ratings.
[03:17:09.258 --> 03:17:12.801]  Your publicist said you have TV calling every day, but you refuse to do it.
[03:17:12.801 --> 03:17:14.122]  You're very private.
[03:17:14.122 --> 03:17:15.283]  That's the whole issue.
[03:17:15.283 --> 03:17:19.007]  They can have Charlie Sheen on for a debate, but they're chicken.
[03:17:19.007 --> 03:17:20.628]  There's another word I would add to that.
[03:17:20.628 --> 03:17:24.412]  They are crapping their pants because they've read your letter.
[03:17:24.412 --> 03:17:28.696]  Folks, get us 20 minutes with the President off InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:17:29.056 --> 03:17:35.258]  Email it to everybody again and point out, these cowards are afraid to debate him on this.
[03:17:35.258 --> 03:17:36.778]  Get his video message.
[03:17:36.778 --> 03:17:37.918]  Put it everywhere.
[03:17:37.918 --> 03:17:38.878]  Print them off.
[03:17:38.878 --> 03:17:40.619]  Mail them to everybody in your area.
[03:17:40.619 --> 03:17:42.079]  To talk show hosts.
[03:17:42.079 --> 03:17:45.960]  Sometimes a million copies of a book can change the world.
[03:17:45.960 --> 03:17:49.101]  There's already millions of copies of 20 Minutes with the President out there.
[03:17:49.101 --> 03:17:52.982]  Let's expand what we're doing and know that they're scared.
[03:17:52.982 --> 03:17:53.742]  How about this, Alex?
[03:17:53.742 --> 03:17:54.922]  How about this?
[03:17:54.922 --> 03:17:56.043]  Hey, CNN.
[03:17:56.043 --> 03:17:57.203]  Mention the story.
[03:17:58.177 --> 03:18:02.918]  CNN have the balls to just give a small link, just in entertainment, maybe.
[03:18:02.918 --> 03:18:05.199]  Just a tiny little blurb.
[03:18:05.199 --> 03:18:07.720]  Sheen to question Obama.
[03:18:07.720 --> 03:18:10.781]  Sheen demands an audience.
[03:18:10.781 --> 03:18:11.301]  Something.
[03:18:11.301 --> 03:18:12.161]  Anything.
[03:18:12.161 --> 03:18:14.982]  No, they're scared of it, even though it's a major news story.
[03:18:14.982 --> 03:18:18.203]  Charlie, you've got some more tricks up in your sleeves in the next few weeks coming up.
[03:18:18.203 --> 03:18:25.445]  There'll be more developments here for folks, and perhaps we can get you to pop in and give us updates, but again, you've already really
[03:18:26.616 --> 03:18:27.917]  You know what Alex, let me just mention this also.
[03:18:27.917 --> 03:18:33.519]  Make sure people tune into the red carpet on Sunday for the Emmys because, you know, I got a billion people watching and it's live.
[03:18:33.519 --> 03:18:35.540]  So, that's no threat or challenge, this is the truth.
[03:18:50.925 --> 03:18:53.286]  All right, let's cram one more call in.
[03:18:53.286 --> 03:18:56.508]  Let's talk to Jim in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[03:18:56.508 --> 03:18:57.408]  Go ahead, Jim, quickly.
[03:18:57.408 --> 03:18:59.569]  Hi, Alex and Charlie.
[03:18:59.569 --> 03:19:01.070]  Jim, how are you?
[03:19:01.070 --> 03:19:02.691]  I'm doing great.
[03:19:02.691 --> 03:19:07.133]  Thanks for all you're doing to expose the truth regarding 9-11.
[03:19:07.133 --> 03:19:08.714]  Let me tell you a little bit about myself.
[03:19:08.714 --> 03:19:11.215]  I've been a firefighter for over 30 years.
[03:19:11.215 --> 03:19:17.638]  I voted for George Bush twice, but I recently woke up regarding the truth about 9-11.
[03:19:17.638 --> 03:19:18.678]  30 years ago, I was told
[03:19:20.970 --> 03:19:27.151]  When I entered the fire service, they said, telephone, telegraph, telefireman.
[03:19:27.151 --> 03:19:29.832]  In other words, firemen have big mouths.
[03:19:29.832 --> 03:19:31.152]  They talk.
[03:19:31.152 --> 03:19:34.833]  Telephone, telegraph, telefireman.
[03:19:34.833 --> 03:19:42.755]  And if you could get the word out to the firefighters, because the firefighters from 9-11, they were not only heroes, they were victims.
[03:19:43.300 --> 03:19:44.041]  I hear you.
[03:19:44.041 --> 03:19:45.782]  Let me throw this in.
[03:19:45.782 --> 03:19:50.006]  Russia Today, of all people, did interviews with a fire captain.
[03:19:50.006 --> 03:19:59.053]  We posted it on InfoWars yesterday, and he's saying, no, I've looked at the evidence, and it just freaks you out when you look at the evidence of 9-11 being an inside job.
[03:19:59.053 --> 03:20:05.598]  I have been to five 9-11s, and maybe a third, half of the firemen would wave at you and thank you.
[03:20:05.598 --> 03:20:08.901]  Now the majority buy you dinner, pat you on the back.
[03:20:08.901 --> 03:20:12.404]  I had police captains say, keep it up, Jones, just two years ago.
[03:20:14.145 --> 03:20:18.868]  On record, the firemen and police, a lot of them are awake in New York.
[03:20:18.868 --> 03:20:21.730]  The media won't go talk to them though.
[03:20:21.730 --> 03:20:23.332]  Charlie, your comments on that?
[03:20:23.332 --> 03:20:25.193]  The media doesn't fight fires.
[03:20:25.193 --> 03:20:26.454]  These guys fight fires.
[03:20:26.454 --> 03:20:27.735]  They know what fires do.
[03:20:27.735 --> 03:20:29.016]  They know how fires behave.
[03:20:29.016 --> 03:20:32.498]  They know what fires are capable of.
[03:20:32.498 --> 03:20:32.918]  Period.
[03:20:32.918 --> 03:20:33.699]  The end.
[03:20:33.699 --> 03:20:35.440]  The media wasn't there.
[03:20:35.440 --> 03:20:36.661]  These guys were.
[03:20:36.661 --> 03:20:37.021]  Period.
[03:20:37.021 --> 03:20:37.361]  The end.
[03:20:37.361 --> 03:20:41.284]  These guys were there.
[03:20:41.284 --> 03:20:43.486]  Anything else, Jim in Milwaukee?
[03:20:44.127 --> 03:20:51.229]  Yeah, my idea is if you could collect interviews from just the firemen, because that's what really convinced me.
[03:20:51.229 --> 03:21:05.032]  When I saw that John Schroeder, he was wearing that green shirt, kind of a meatball-looking guy, but when he was talking about how he was thrown about like a pinball, how he ran out of that fire like a bunch of cockroaches, that
[03:21:07.441 --> 03:21:10.283]  You know, that gritty, earthy language, that convinced me.
[03:21:10.283 --> 03:21:18.087]  Well, I mean, we've got hundreds of firefighters saying it was like lava, there were bombs going off, they told us to get back, they were going to blow it.
[03:21:18.087 --> 03:21:21.169]  We've interviewed police, emergency workers saying the same thing.
[03:21:21.169 --> 03:21:26.351]  It's on video that day live, police going, they're blowing Building 7, get back!
[03:21:26.351 --> 03:21:32.815]  And then I talked to the emergency workers who heard the countdown, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, and he's like, what's the countdown?
[03:21:32.995 --> 03:21:33.876]  They're blowing it!
[03:21:33.876 --> 03:21:35.237]  Run for your lives!
[03:21:35.237 --> 03:21:36.698]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[03:21:36.698 --> 03:21:39.181]  I mean, that's all covered in my film, Truth Rising.
[03:21:42.045 --> 03:21:47.607]  You could collect and make maybe a 30-minute DVD just aimed at firemen.
[03:21:47.607 --> 03:21:50.808]  Because if the firemen knew it, it'd be like starting fire.
[03:21:50.808 --> 03:21:59.652]  Hey, firefighter engineering said all three of the towers were impossible in their major national magazine, biggest and oldest firefighter publication.
[03:21:59.652 --> 03:22:00.512]  But yes, you're right.
[03:22:00.512 --> 03:22:04.313]  Charlie Sheen, again, you talk about a bottomless pit of evidence.
[03:22:04.313 --> 03:22:08.355]  I mean, right there, firefighting engineering says it's a cover-up.
[03:22:09.352 --> 03:22:16.118]  Yeah, but, you know, Sean Hannity didn't agree, so it must not be true, Alex.
[03:22:16.118 --> 03:22:17.479]  Pathetic.
[03:22:17.479 --> 03:22:18.740]  And then he's another fake.
[03:22:18.740 --> 03:22:20.942]  Bush triples the size of government.
[03:22:20.942 --> 03:22:22.543]  Hannity's a conservative.
[03:22:22.543 --> 03:22:25.385]  Glenn Beck supports the banker bailout.
[03:22:25.385 --> 03:22:30.089]  The Democrats are now supporting Obama increasing troops.
[03:22:30.089 --> 03:22:34.853]  Incidentally, everybody needs to read your open letter on InfoWars to Glenn Beck.
[03:22:34.853 --> 03:22:35.774]  It's fabulous.
[03:22:36.571 --> 03:22:38.192]  That's not as good as what you wrote.
[03:22:38.192 --> 03:22:39.053]  Doesn't matter.
[03:22:39.053 --> 03:22:39.933]  Doesn't matter.
[03:22:39.933 --> 03:22:41.334]  Not a contest.
[03:22:41.334 --> 03:22:42.155]  No, I know, I know.
[03:22:42.155 --> 03:22:47.078]  It's just, I saw you really craft your letter to the President and mine's done.
[03:22:47.078 --> 03:22:48.259]  I mean, Beck is something else.
[03:22:48.259 --> 03:22:49.499]  Let's take another call here.
[03:22:49.499 --> 03:22:52.201]  Let's talk to Marino in New Jersey.
[03:22:52.201 --> 03:22:53.322]  You're on the air, Marino.
[03:22:53.322 --> 03:22:58.185]  Hey, AJ, and Charlie, how you guys doing?
[03:22:58.185 --> 03:22:58.705]  Doing good, man.
[03:22:58.705 --> 03:22:59.986]  How are you?
[03:22:59.986 --> 03:23:01.667]  I'm doing great.
[03:23:01.667 --> 03:23:05.490]  I'd like to say that I'm proud for you that you came out with that
[03:23:06.581 --> 03:23:11.006]  But that transcript with the 20 bullet points, I mean, like, wow, that was just genius.
[03:23:11.006 --> 03:23:11.907]  Oh, thank you.
[03:23:11.907 --> 03:23:13.790]  I mean, a lot of people that, like...
[03:23:14.542 --> 03:23:26.450]  I've been talking to, I've been saying this is just like a huge blow to the truth movement, when in fact it's not, because once it reaches the consensus of people, it will just reach the masses, it will just keep on expanding.
[03:23:45.623 --> 03:23:59.271]  Well, yeah, no, they were looking for any angle to expose, and what they were doing, in turn, was directing more attention to the document, to the letter.
[03:23:59.271 --> 03:24:00.472]  Which is what we planned.
[03:24:00.472 --> 03:24:01.552]  Yeah, absolutely, yeah.
[03:24:01.552 --> 03:24:04.454]  These people cannot help themselves.
[03:24:04.454 --> 03:24:12.359]  And they played right into our hands, and we're really grateful for all their support and all their exposure, 20 minutes with the President.
[03:24:15.754 --> 03:24:17.835]  We are truly grateful, Alex.
[03:24:17.835 --> 03:24:21.116]  Oh, Charlie, you're something else, man.
[03:24:21.116 --> 03:24:22.396]  Something else, Charlie Sheen.
[03:24:22.396 --> 03:24:26.557]  In the time we've got left here, it's always great having you.
[03:24:26.557 --> 03:24:28.017]  Big announcement.
[03:24:28.017 --> 03:24:31.879]  Charlie, in the next week, it's going to be a month-long contest.
[03:24:31.879 --> 03:24:35.980]  We'll post the rules, details, but you announce the contest.
[03:24:35.980 --> 03:24:39.201]  You are the judge, and you're paying out the cash prize.
[03:24:39.201 --> 03:24:40.141]  Right now or after the break?
[03:24:41.285 --> 03:24:42.286]  It's a final segment.
[03:24:42.286 --> 03:24:45.870]  Go ahead and announce it.
[03:24:45.870 --> 03:25:00.845]  There is a contest that is directly related to 20 Minutes with the President, and what we are requesting is that any man, woman, or child, regardless of race,
[03:25:02.384 --> 03:25:09.308]  Sit down and put on video, on video, two characters actually reading 20 minutes with the President.
[03:25:09.308 --> 03:25:12.350]  Somebody plays me, somebody plays the President.
[03:25:12.350 --> 03:25:28.239]  And what Alex and I are going to do is we're going to take all the video submissions, if you want to read the whole thing, if you want to read a portion of it, if you want to do, however you interpret it, whatever language you interpret it in, we're going to take those video submissions and Alex and I are going to decide
[03:25:29.420 --> 03:25:32.002]  On who the winner is.
[03:25:32.002 --> 03:25:34.143]  And it may not be based on performance.
[03:25:34.143 --> 03:25:38.145]  It may be based on other elements of the presentation.
[03:25:38.145 --> 03:25:39.686]  It's solely our discretion.
[03:25:39.686 --> 03:25:40.707]  It's our discretion, yeah.
[03:25:40.707 --> 03:25:45.230]  And there is a $10,000 cash prize to the winner.
[03:25:45.230 --> 03:25:47.451]  But in addition to that,
[03:25:48.140 --> 03:26:02.865]  We're also going to take from all the submissions a small segment and we're going to put it all together so there is a universally created 20 minutes with the President as well.
[03:26:02.865 --> 03:26:14.649]  We'll have the winner's video and then we'll have the compilation video as a representation for all the voices that step forward and have the courage to commit this thing
[03:26:15.313 --> 03:26:22.557]  To a video record and make themselves available for the world to observe.
[03:26:22.557 --> 03:26:24.438]  And we're really excited about it.
[03:26:24.438 --> 03:26:30.200]  And we're excited about the YouTube video, my message to Obama, is blowing up right now.
[03:26:30.200 --> 03:26:40.725]  And so we think that once the theatrical versions, the fan versions, is going to drive this thing
[03:26:42.475 --> 03:26:46.777]  Beyond supernova, hopefully approaching dark matter.
[03:26:46.777 --> 03:26:47.297]  Absolutely.
[03:26:47.297 --> 03:26:49.278]  We have our own private scale.
[03:26:49.278 --> 03:26:58.942]  Back when I said in 2006 it's gone supernova, it goes nova, supernova, black hole, super black hole, dark matter, on how big we want this to be.
[03:26:58.942 --> 03:27:02.523]  But we'll probably get 200, 300, 400 submissions.
[03:27:02.523 --> 03:27:04.844]  All of those will get thousands apiece.
[03:27:04.844 --> 03:27:06.685]  And the winner will get hundreds of thousands.
[03:27:07.785 --> 03:27:09.727]  Thousands of versions.
[03:27:09.727 --> 03:27:11.188]  More than 500 I've counted now.
[03:27:11.188 --> 03:27:14.651]  I had to quit counting on YouTube.
[03:27:14.651 --> 03:27:19.035]  Over 200 with the same title of your message to the President.
[03:27:19.035 --> 03:27:20.217]  Our video is approaching 600,000.
[03:27:20.217 --> 03:27:25.682]  It's several million conservatively in just that video that is so effective.
[03:27:25.682 --> 03:27:28.524]  You and Aaron did a great job putting that together, Charlie.
[03:27:28.524 --> 03:27:28.885]  Thank you.
[03:27:28.885 --> 03:27:29.986]  Thank you.
[03:27:29.986 --> 03:27:31.767]  And so phase two, for those that don't know,
[03:27:32.728 --> 03:27:49.821]  It's going to be hundreds and hundreds of videos with people doing all of 20 Minutes with the President, part of it theatrically, two white guys, two black guys, two women, a woman and a man, however you want, whatever way you want to put it on, whatever touches our hearts the most, whatever, whatever, Charlie's the main judge.
[03:27:49.821 --> 03:27:51.862]  I'm going to kind of boil down because he probably can't watch 300 or 400.
[03:27:54.202 --> 03:27:59.784]  But Alex, I'm going to watch as many as I can because to me that is such a compliment.
[03:27:59.784 --> 03:28:12.948]  That people would take the time, have the interest, have the passion to sit down and bring this document to life and to have the courage to share it with the world.
[03:28:12.948 --> 03:28:15.529]  How about this be part of the prize too?
[03:28:15.529 --> 03:28:19.190]  We'll announce the details next week, we'll give people a month to make us, they have plenty of time.
[03:28:20.413 --> 03:28:27.960]  We'll have the winner on for 10 minutes with you, too, to talk about the piece when we announce the winner and play it on air.
[03:28:27.960 --> 03:28:28.621]  How's that sound?
[03:28:28.621 --> 03:28:29.261]  Great idea.
[03:28:29.261 --> 03:28:29.642]  Love it.
[03:28:29.642 --> 03:28:29.842]  Done.
[03:28:30.825 --> 03:28:39.733]  So you will then on air announce the winner and we'll at the same time have that person, call that person, have them lined up and we have first, second and third place together.
[03:28:39.733 --> 03:28:46.098]  They won't know who's going to win and we'll have first place on the air with you a month after this is announced when we announce who the winner is.
[03:28:46.098 --> 03:28:56.488]  I think it's a great idea Charlie and tens of millions more people will see 20 minutes with the President and those 20 bullet points I think is most important you've set off air to have in the piece
[03:28:57.148 --> 03:29:00.070]  And then tens of millions more people will learn the truth.
[03:29:00.070 --> 03:29:01.411]  This is so exciting.
[03:29:01.411 --> 03:29:02.532]  Absolutely.
[03:29:02.532 --> 03:29:22.607]  And also keep in mind, if people want to get creative, if they want to do what we did with my video message on YouTube, if they want to integrate images, give voiceover visuals, however they interpret it, whatever, however it speaks to them, however they choose to express it, we are wide open to.
[03:29:24.143 --> 03:29:26.704]  $10,000 prize.
[03:29:26.704 --> 03:29:32.466]  I'm going to announce later today the winner of the last $1,000 contest, but this is huge.
[03:29:32.466 --> 03:29:33.026]  $10,000 prize.
[03:29:33.026 --> 03:29:37.668]  We'll have the details up in the next week, and then you'll have a month to complete it and get your submissions in.
[03:29:37.668 --> 03:29:39.429]  Charlie Sheen, I salute your courage.
[03:29:39.429 --> 03:29:41.329]  I love you, and I appreciate you.
[03:29:41.329 --> 03:29:42.029]  Back at you, Alex.
[03:29:42.029 --> 03:29:42.470]  I love you, too.
[03:29:42.470 --> 03:29:43.750]  Thank you so much, brother.
[03:29:43.750 --> 03:29:44.170]  You bet.
[03:29:44.170 --> 03:29:45.491]  I'll say bye to you off-air.
[03:29:45.491 --> 03:29:46.131]  Stay with us, folks.
[03:29:51.764 --> 03:29:55.687]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.687 --> 03:29:58.369]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.101 --> 03:30:05.345]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.345 --> 03:30:07.347]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.347 --> 03:30:15.876]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.876 --> 03:30:21.421]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.421 --> 03:30:23.063]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.283 --> 03:30:29.787]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.787 --> 03:30:40.855]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.855 --> 03:30:41.615]  That's right.
[03:30:41.615 --> 03:30:44.197]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[03:30:44.197 --> 03:30:45.998]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[03:30:45.998 --> 03:30:46.258]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[03:30:46.258 --> 03:30:47.439]  Or visit acolablue.com.
[03:30:53.183 --> 03:30:53.704]  We're good.
[03:31:04.677 --> 03:31:05.357]  It's here.
[03:31:05.357 --> 03:31:10.500]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[03:31:10.500 --> 03:31:18.844]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[03:31:18.844 --> 03:31:25.847]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[03:31:26.267 --> 03:31:38.012]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[03:31:38.012 --> 03:31:41.973]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[03:31:41.973 --> 03:31:44.234]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[03:31:44.234 --> 03:31:48.016]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[03:32:01.755 --> 03:32:03.797]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[03:32:03.797 --> 03:32:06.739]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[03:32:06.739 --> 03:32:08.980]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[03:32:08.980 --> 03:32:09.961]  Here's the story.
[03:32:09.961 --> 03:32:14.765]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[03:32:14.765 --> 03:32:16.026]  Now here's the bad news.
[03:32:16.026 --> 03:32:21.089]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[03:32:21.089 --> 03:32:22.951]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[03:32:23.211 --> 03:32:27.815]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[03:32:27.815 --> 03:32:33.341]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[03:32:33.341 --> 03:32:35.523]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[03:32:35.523 --> 03:32:44.231]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[03:32:44.531 --> 03:32:49.712]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[03:32:49.712 --> 03:32:53.813]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[03:32:53.813 --> 03:32:56.794]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[03:32:56.794 --> 03:33:04.176]  We got a lot of big flu news coming up in the next few days.
[03:33:15.148 --> 03:33:23.371]  Back before the show ends, I'm gonna hit on this article.
[03:33:23.371 --> 03:33:28.673]  Doctor says 60,000 may die from swine flu vaccine.
[03:33:28.673 --> 03:33:31.775]  I just had that in my stack.
[03:33:31.775 --> 03:33:35.416]  Where did that turkey go?
[03:33:35.416 --> 03:33:37.297]  You know what, I can't keep track of all this anymore.
[03:33:37.297 --> 03:33:39.238]  Guys, reprint that for me.
[03:33:39.238 --> 03:33:40.458]  Thank you.
[03:33:40.458 --> 03:33:41.499]  Good job.
[03:33:41.499 --> 03:33:44.480]  We're gonna go to Marty Schachter for five, six minutes here in just a moment.
[03:33:45.882 --> 03:33:48.924]  Charlie Sheen doesn't like to toot his own horn.
[03:33:48.924 --> 03:33:52.165]  I forgot to tell you, the prize is going to be $13,500.
[03:33:52.165 --> 03:33:54.226]  Because he wants whoever gets the $10,000 to get $10,000 after taxes.
[03:33:54.226 --> 03:33:56.367]  So, average person's paying 37% federal tax.
[03:33:56.367 --> 03:33:57.008]  You're going to get $13,500 prize.
[03:33:57.008 --> 03:33:57.508]  $10,000 real payout.
[03:34:15.689 --> 03:34:21.094]  And that's on the best reproduction in any way you want to do it, any style.
[03:34:21.094 --> 03:34:29.342]  Two women, two men, a black person, a white person, oriental, Asian, Hispanic, Eskimo, whatever.
[03:34:31.195 --> 03:34:36.837]  It can be however you want, reenacted, done in film style, any way you want.
[03:34:36.837 --> 03:34:47.462]  Charlie Sheen is, well you heard him, I had told him I'll watch the hundreds of videos for you and send you what I think the best 50 are and he said no, I'm going to try to watch them all.
[03:34:47.462 --> 03:34:50.823]  I don't know if he knows what he's getting into because the problem is you don't just watch them once.
[03:34:50.823 --> 03:34:57.686]  It's like with this latest contest, I keep watching them and watching them and I got a film to make and I'm going, is that best or is this best?
[03:34:59.255 --> 03:35:21.809]  I know I said I'd announce it Friday the last contest for a thousand bucks and I said I'd do it today and I'm gonna try to put it up on the site tonight probably tomorrow because they go oh you didn't see these 35 submissions over here and I'm like I will not cheat those people I will not not watch their submissions but great political posters you made we had the Obama Joker poster contest that was a big success then we had the
[03:35:23.115 --> 03:35:25.336]  New one of any political poster you wanted.
[03:35:25.336 --> 03:35:29.097]  Whoever makes the best idea poster, posts it and videotapes it.
[03:35:29.097 --> 03:35:31.618]  Well, this new contest with Sheen, $13,500.
[03:35:31.618 --> 03:35:31.638]  $13,500.
[03:35:31.638 --> 03:35:32.818]  $10,000 after taxes.
[03:35:32.818 --> 03:35:33.138]  $10,000 payout.
[03:35:33.138 --> 03:35:33.158]  $13,500.
[03:35:33.158 --> 03:35:33.819]  So you get at least $10,000.
[03:35:33.819 --> 03:35:34.039]  Okay?
[03:35:34.039 --> 03:35:34.579]  From Charlie Sheen.
[03:35:50.663 --> 03:35:53.885]  Now I've got to write up the rules and all that and post it.
[03:35:53.885 --> 03:35:56.387]  But it's basically our total discretion who wins.
[03:35:56.387 --> 03:35:59.429]  Charlie Sheen and I. But he's going to be the one making the choice.
[03:35:59.429 --> 03:36:03.192]  And so people then try to play games with rules and gripe if they don't win.
[03:36:03.192 --> 03:36:06.675]  It's just whoever we decide the best is, you win.
[03:36:06.675 --> 03:36:07.615]  Okay?
[03:36:07.615 --> 03:36:09.577]  And we're very, very excited about that.
[03:36:09.577 --> 03:36:13.840]  And this, again, hundreds and hundreds of videos will be made.
[03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:15.922]  I'll tell you this, you've got five weeks.
[03:36:15.922 --> 03:36:17.463]  Next week I'm going to post the date.
[03:36:17.463 --> 03:36:18.944]  I'm going to give you a month out.
[03:36:21.270 --> 03:36:23.395]  And I would get them in a couple weeks after that.
[03:36:23.395 --> 03:36:25.320]  So you got three, four weeks to get this done.
[03:36:25.320 --> 03:36:28.408]  I will tell you it's a free-for-all, basically.
[03:36:28.408 --> 03:36:29.611]  Whatever we think is the best.
[03:36:30.922 --> 03:36:32.283]  You saw the video Aaron made.
[03:36:32.283 --> 03:36:33.203]  It took him a week to make.
[03:36:33.203 --> 03:36:35.604]  You've seen that get millions of views.
[03:36:35.604 --> 03:36:39.206]  This is going to be huge for 9-11 Truth, and it's only one more phase.
[03:36:39.206 --> 03:36:46.769]  We've got other tricks up our sleeves for 9-11 Truth coming up in the next few weeks that'll be announced here on air by myself and by Charlie Sheen.
[03:36:46.769 --> 03:36:52.671]  And whoever wins will be on air with Charlie Sheen with me when we give first, second, and third place.
[03:36:52.671 --> 03:36:53.692]  Charlie wants to pay
[03:36:54.915 --> 03:36:57.717]  For it all, but I'm not going to let him.
[03:36:57.717 --> 03:36:58.958]  But I don't have a lot of money.
[03:36:58.958 --> 03:37:03.281]  So, second place will be $1,000, third place will be $500.
[03:37:03.281 --> 03:37:08.925]  But all three of you will get to pop in and talk to Charlie Sheen on air.
[03:37:08.925 --> 03:37:10.766]  $13,500, prize one.
[03:37:10.766 --> 03:37:14.109]  So, $10,000 for taxes.
[03:37:14.109 --> 03:37:16.811]  $1,000 for prize two, $500 for prize three.
[03:37:16.811 --> 03:37:17.992]  Okay?
[03:37:17.992 --> 03:37:21.034]  That's it, because I want to be able to recognize some other folks as well.
[03:37:22.346 --> 03:37:25.528]  But regardless, you win, win, win by getting 9-11 truth out.
[03:37:25.528 --> 03:37:32.231]  And I'll tell you, the one thing I would lean towards is getting those 20 bullet points out.
[03:37:32.231 --> 03:37:34.353]  We'll see who wins, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:37:34.353 --> 03:37:36.494]  We'll see who wins.
[03:37:36.494 --> 03:37:41.256]  Okay, that should be announced right around the time my new film, Fall of the Republic, comes out.
[03:37:41.256 --> 03:37:43.618]  Okay, I want to hit on this.
[03:37:43.618 --> 03:37:46.339]  Doctor says flu vaccine will cause 60,000 deaths in France alone.
[03:37:49.591 --> 03:37:51.453]  Another one saying similar things in Germany.
[03:37:51.453 --> 03:37:53.834]  We're going to hit on that, but I want to go to Marty Schachter.
[03:37:53.834 --> 03:37:58.778]  World War II veteran, started Calvin Pierce Soap Company with his father in 1947.
[03:37:58.778 --> 03:38:02.461]  That's 62 years and counting.
[03:38:02.461 --> 03:38:06.785]  He was in the Chemical Weapons Corps, so he came home and saw what was in the detergent soap.
[03:38:06.785 --> 03:38:10.448]  They were getting rid of regular soap, and he said, I'm going to make real organic soap.
[03:38:10.448 --> 03:38:12.389]  You get 85% off on this soap.
[03:38:12.389 --> 03:38:12.629]  Why?
[03:38:13.510 --> 03:38:16.414]  Because you don't pay for Procter & Gamble's advertising, all that.
[03:38:16.414 --> 03:38:22.040]  It's factory direct, no middleman, and it's totally organic, and it's what I use in my house.
[03:38:22.040 --> 03:38:26.926]  Bath soap, dish soap, hair soap, creams, everything.
[03:38:26.926 --> 03:38:32.052]  5 Star Soap, the letter 5, the number 5, or spell it out, 5starsoap.com.
[03:38:32.052 --> 03:38:33.173]  Either way, spell it out.
[03:38:33.934 --> 03:38:35.175]  Wow, what an endorsement!
[03:38:35.175 --> 03:38:37.097]  I really appreciate that.
[03:38:37.097 --> 03:38:38.998]  We're fighting Procter & Gamble every day.
[03:38:38.998 --> 03:38:40.999]  They did last year $65 billion worth of business.
[03:38:55.130 --> 03:38:57.652]  10% of that went to TV advertisements.
[03:38:57.652 --> 03:39:04.535]  They're the biggest in the world and they sell everything that you need or what you really don't need.
[03:39:04.535 --> 03:39:12.820]  Chemicals that are just absolutely horrendous in their perfumes, in their toxicity, in their costs.
[03:39:13.260 --> 03:39:14.942]  And we don't need that.
[03:39:14.942 --> 03:39:20.267]  What we do need is freedom of choice, and this is what I offer all your listeners.
[03:39:20.267 --> 03:39:31.079]  Freedom of choice to buy soaps twice as good as what they're buying now, twice as good as what they're using now, and this has been our goal, our philosophy, and our success.
[03:39:33.030 --> 03:39:43.954]  Absolutely, and again the toll-free number for people to call, we'll put that up on screen for folks, is 1-800-340-7091.
[03:39:43.954 --> 03:39:47.035]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[03:39:47.035 --> 03:39:54.597]  You, your son, your family, the great crew are there to take people's orders, get a free brochure, or get the sample tote bag.
[03:39:54.597 --> 03:39:56.318]  Tell folks about the sample tote bag.
[03:39:56.732 --> 03:39:58.634]  Well we put together by hand.
[03:39:58.634 --> 03:40:01.257]  We got two young ladies doing that.
[03:40:01.257 --> 03:40:03.359]  It's a six pound package.
[03:40:03.359 --> 03:40:09.946]  It's got in there four bars of our pure soap for bathing, showering, nothing like it anywhere.
[03:40:09.946 --> 03:40:11.188]  It's got a 16 ounce pint.
[03:40:13.690 --> 03:40:14.391]  We're good to go.
[03:40:34.602 --> 03:40:53.371]  18 ounces and a little jar with a little tiny measuring scoop of our granulated laundry soap for washing clothes, overalls, plumber goods, everything in your any washing machine, especially the new upfront washing machines, which are the popular ones.
[03:40:53.371 --> 03:40:54.272]  I've got one.
[03:40:54.272 --> 03:40:55.392]  They're wonderful.
[03:40:55.392 --> 03:40:56.793]  Also a book of instructions.
[03:40:57.233 --> 03:40:59.095]  Covering all the products.
[03:40:59.095 --> 03:41:01.296]  All the different uses for the products.
[03:41:01.296 --> 03:41:04.079]  A large nylon scarring pad.
[03:41:04.079 --> 03:41:05.720]  9 inches by 6 inches.
[03:41:05.720 --> 03:41:07.001]  Commercial size.
[03:41:07.001 --> 03:41:09.903]  You can cut it in half or in quarter with scissors.
[03:41:09.903 --> 03:41:15.067]  Replaces Ajax and Comet and Steel Wolf and SOS pads and Chore Girls.
[03:41:15.067 --> 03:41:16.809]  Don't need them ever again.
[03:41:16.809 --> 03:41:18.810]  All put together in the last year.
[03:41:18.810 --> 03:41:19.911]  4 to 8 weeks.
[03:41:19.911 --> 03:41:21.632]  Depending on your washing habits.
[03:41:21.632 --> 03:41:23.034]  Depending on your size.
[03:41:23.034 --> 03:41:23.454]  Family. $20.
[03:41:25.175 --> 03:41:31.058]  It's a bargain, it's handmade, it's unconditionally guaranteed to satisfy you.
[03:41:31.058 --> 03:41:45.546]  This is to start you off on a whole new cleanliness program, a better program, twice as good as Procter & Gamble and Lever Brothers and Colgate and all the other chemical companies that sell more perfumes than they do cleaning products.
[03:41:45.546 --> 03:41:46.747]  Don't believe in that.
[03:41:46.747 --> 03:41:51.730]  Believe in getting something better, believe in freedom of choice, that you can buy something
[03:41:52.330 --> 03:41:59.117]  Far, far twice as good, three times as good as Procter & Gamble, $65 billion corporation.
[03:41:59.117 --> 03:42:01.960]  We're a family owned, family company.
[03:42:01.960 --> 03:42:10.649]  We have survived for 62 years and the only way you can do that is to have quality, is to have value, is to have
[03:42:15.137 --> 03:42:16.658]  The better price.
[03:42:16.658 --> 03:42:22.100]  Prices that save you money, save you clothing, save you skin, save you hair.
[03:42:22.100 --> 03:42:24.100]  Products you've never used before.
[03:42:24.100 --> 03:42:30.523]  Products that I used to make for hospitals, and schools, and institutions, and corporations, and car washes.
[03:42:30.523 --> 03:42:31.683]  We made it for them.
[03:42:31.683 --> 03:42:32.683]  We survived.
[03:42:32.683 --> 03:42:33.504]  We're there.
[03:42:33.504 --> 03:42:34.604]  We're gonna please you.
[03:42:34.604 --> 03:42:36.905]  You're gonna, all you're gonna say is,
[03:42:37.245 --> 03:42:38.966]  Where have you been all my life?
[03:42:38.966 --> 03:42:46.030]  Well, we're here right now, and with the help of Alex, we're gonna spread good cleanliness, honest cleanliness.
[03:42:46.030 --> 03:42:49.191]  Without cleanliness, we have no civilization.
[03:42:49.191 --> 03:42:54.314]  And we give you the best cleanliness money can buy.
[03:42:54.314 --> 03:42:55.514]  Absolutely, my friend.
[03:42:55.514 --> 03:42:57.395]  Toll-free number to call 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com.
[03:42:57.395 --> 03:42:58.056]  Marty, give us a limerick.
[03:43:05.404 --> 03:43:08.846]  This is from a jolly old England.
[03:43:08.846 --> 03:43:16.029]  There was a young lady of Twickenham whose shoes were too tight to walk quick in them.
[03:43:16.029 --> 03:43:22.972]  She came back from her walk looking right as a chalk and took both off and was sick in them.
[03:43:29.113 --> 03:43:33.256]  Oh my gosh, 5starsoap.com, 800-340-7091.
[03:43:33.256 --> 03:43:35.517]  Marty, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[03:43:35.517 --> 03:43:40.380]  Looking forward to talking to you and your listeners right now.
[03:43:40.380 --> 03:43:41.380]  God bless you.
[03:43:41.380 --> 03:43:42.081]  Take care, Marty.
[03:43:43.459 --> 03:43:44.799]  There goes Marty Schachter.
[03:43:44.799 --> 03:43:48.820]  Okay, I'm gonna jam in a few calls, then in the final segment, I'm gonna get into this flu news.
[03:43:48.820 --> 03:43:54.821]  We're lining up a bunch of guests in the next week, two weeks on this subject, but it's not looking good.
[03:43:54.821 --> 03:44:00.582]  Doctor says flu vaccine will cause 60,000 deaths in France alone.
[03:44:00.582 --> 03:44:01.423]  Amazing.
[03:44:01.423 --> 03:44:03.143]  We're gonna be covering that in the final segment.
[03:44:03.143 --> 03:44:05.823]  Right now, let's go to Herb in Atlanta.
[03:44:05.823 --> 03:44:08.264]  Herb, sorry you didn't get a chance to talk to Charlie, but go ahead.
[03:44:09.266 --> 03:44:10.827]  Yeah, man, I sure did.
[03:44:10.827 --> 03:44:14.588]  In fact, I'm going to ask my question as if he was still there.
[03:44:14.588 --> 03:44:17.510]  The alternative media, Alex, is dying.
[03:44:17.510 --> 03:44:22.412]  The global media is out of business and it's because of the alternative media.
[03:44:22.412 --> 03:44:24.032]  I'm calling Satellite Radio today.
[03:44:24.032 --> 03:44:25.093]  I got four radios.
[03:44:25.093 --> 03:44:26.574]  I'm canceling two of them.
[03:44:26.574 --> 03:44:29.835]  I want to find out how I can get your tape because I'm through with it.
[03:44:29.835 --> 03:44:33.136]  Now, Alex, I know you've got connections in Great Britain.
[03:44:33.136 --> 03:44:36.358]  I've been trying to get this book, The New Underworld Order,
[03:44:36.877 --> 03:44:44.342]  The Triumph of Criminalism, the Global Hegemony of Masonic Intelligence, a book by David Storey.
[03:44:44.342 --> 03:44:45.203]  I hope you can help me get that.
[03:44:45.203 --> 03:44:49.866]  I don't know the book, but it sounds really interesting.
[03:44:49.866 --> 03:44:53.208]  Yes, I want to talk to you about that later, but I want to say this, Alex.
[03:44:53.208 --> 03:45:02.374]  Hollywood put forth a concerted effort to elect Obama, and my question is this, and this is going out to Hollywood, the La La Land, as they call it.
[03:45:03.129 --> 03:45:12.337]  If they put forth that kind of effort to elect Obama, why won't they get behind Charlie Sheen to demand that the truth gets out about what happened on 9-11?
[03:45:12.337 --> 03:45:14.519]  Still having nightmares about it.
[03:45:14.519 --> 03:45:18.603]  Well, I wish that I would have gone to you.
[03:45:18.603 --> 03:45:19.264]  Great point.
[03:45:19.264 --> 03:45:20.365]  Now, that's what Charlie's saying.
[03:45:20.365 --> 03:45:29.192]  I mean, he didn't expect them all to line up behind him, but he goes... I mean, he knows a lot of these people, and a lot of people he talks to don't believe the official story.
[03:45:30.086 --> 03:45:36.712]  And they're just scared to speak out, and he's like, how do you let these people get away with what they've done?
[03:45:40.936 --> 03:45:43.839]  He's just a Hollywood star, but he's a smart, intelligent guy.
[03:45:43.839 --> 03:45:46.762]  He doesn't have some huge view of himself.
[03:45:46.762 --> 03:45:51.668]  He understands, though, the power position of a major TV slash movie star.
[03:45:51.668 --> 03:45:56.093]  And so he's doing this knowing he'll be attacked because it's the right thing to do.
[03:45:56.093 --> 03:45:58.515]  I mean, that's what's so selfless about this.
[03:45:58.515 --> 03:45:59.356]  I mean, I frankly.
[03:46:00.177 --> 03:46:00.537]  I think so.
[03:46:20.697 --> 03:46:28.685]  And I was sitting around talking to him and some of his family when they were over visiting and they're like, well, this is just positive questions and this is all public record.
[03:46:28.685 --> 03:46:29.986]  They won't attack him for this.
[03:46:29.986 --> 03:46:32.508]  And I said, yeah, they're going to attack you, Charlie.
[03:46:32.508 --> 03:46:39.715]  They're going to misinterpret and they're going to put words in your mouth because that's what they do.
[03:46:39.715 --> 03:46:41.176]  And they did.
[03:46:41.176 --> 03:46:45.520]  But now he wants to fight even more because he is not a coward.
[03:46:46.724 --> 03:46:49.485]  And he's gone through so much hell for what he did three years ago.
[03:46:49.485 --> 03:46:53.307]  I mean, if I told people half the crap I know about, people wouldn't believe it.
[03:46:53.307 --> 03:46:54.908]  I mean, look at Mark Cuban.
[03:46:54.908 --> 03:46:57.089]  I was asked not to talk about that at the time.
[03:46:57.089 --> 03:47:01.752]  But it came out in the New York Times, the White House called him up and said, listen, you son of a bitch!
[03:47:02.512 --> 03:47:07.293]  We're going to put your ass in prison for insider trading, because you're a rich guy that owns a lot of stock.
[03:47:07.293 --> 03:47:11.374]  And the way the stock rules are, if they selectively enforce, everything's illegal.
[03:47:11.374 --> 03:47:14.115]  And they sent him an email saying it, too.
[03:47:14.115 --> 03:47:16.035]  And then they indicted him.
[03:47:16.035 --> 03:47:18.876]  I mean, these people don't play games.
[03:47:18.876 --> 03:47:26.398]  I'd like to see all these other schmoes out there that don't have $100 million in the bank, like Charlie Sheen, risking everything to tell the truth.
[03:47:26.398 --> 03:47:27.498]  Your comments on that, Herb?
[03:47:28.527 --> 03:47:29.028]  You know what?
[03:47:29.028 --> 03:47:30.369]  My comment is this.
[03:47:30.369 --> 03:47:35.476]  Al Sharpton, Juan Ballantyne, Joe Madison, you are fired!
[03:47:35.476 --> 03:47:39.881]  All I want to know is how I can get the Alex Jones Show on tape when I'm not able to record.
[03:47:39.881 --> 03:47:45.929]  There's only one program on radio, people, that is worth recording, and I record it every day off the internet.
[03:47:46.329 --> 03:47:46.789]  That's it!
[03:48:16.047 --> 03:48:16.428]  That's it.
[03:48:16.428 --> 03:48:21.194]  And whether you're left or right, black or white, you're going to get the short end of the stick unless we beat these bankers.
[03:48:21.194 --> 03:48:22.115]  I mean, that's it.
[03:48:22.115 --> 03:48:30.525]  Glenn Beck works for the same people Obama do, and they're just meant to fight with each other and get us fighting with each other while the bankers rule over us.
[03:48:30.525 --> 03:48:33.689]  And they write books bragging how they do this to us.
[03:48:33.689 --> 03:48:34.430]  God bless you, sir.
[03:48:35.351 --> 03:48:40.014]  There's a free podcast that over 180,000 people are downloading a day on average.
[03:48:40.014 --> 03:48:41.775]  Some days it's over 200,000.
[03:48:41.775 --> 03:48:45.096]  Just click on the listen section at InfoWars.com.
[03:48:45.096 --> 03:48:46.937]  Put it into your MP3 or iPod.
[03:48:46.937 --> 03:48:53.241]  You can buy a decent MP3 device that'll hold hundreds of hours now for like 20 bucks.
[03:48:53.241 --> 03:48:55.322]  A really nice one for like a hundred.
[03:48:55.322 --> 03:49:02.365]  I've got an old one I used from like five years ago that'll record like a hundred hours that you could buy on eBay for like ten dollars now.
[03:49:04.549 --> 03:49:05.990]  I mean, I'm not saying I'm selling that.
[03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:08.251]  I'm saying I have systems like that.
[03:49:08.251 --> 03:49:12.273]  They got stuff I see at Target for like 20 bucks that records hundreds of hours.
[03:49:12.273 --> 03:49:14.314]  You just copy and paste that in.
[03:49:14.314 --> 03:49:16.315]  You can listen to the free streams.
[03:49:16.315 --> 03:49:18.216]  No matter where you are, you can listen to us free.
[03:49:19.164 --> 03:49:20.485]  Then there's the AM and FM's.
[03:49:20.485 --> 03:49:21.906]  60-something affiliates.
[03:49:21.906 --> 03:49:22.767]  Sounds like a lot.
[03:49:22.767 --> 03:49:23.647]  It's not.
[03:49:23.647 --> 03:49:26.269]  Great stations here and there around the country.
[03:49:26.269 --> 03:49:28.971]  Then we're on Global Shortwave, WWCR.
[03:49:28.971 --> 03:49:31.153]  Buy a $100 shortwave at Radio Shack.
[03:49:31.153 --> 03:49:33.815]  You can listen to us anywhere in the world.
[03:49:33.815 --> 03:49:36.257]  And we're on XM on the weekend.
[03:49:36.257 --> 03:49:37.558]  They only play, like, four hours.
[03:49:37.558 --> 03:49:38.659]  They're, like, testing us out.
[03:49:40.333 --> 03:49:40.453]  Alex.
[03:49:40.453 --> 03:49:40.653]  Yes, sir.
[03:50:10.120 --> 03:50:18.106]  I just, look, I just want to say, I just want to say thank you, uh, for all the work that you guys are doing and setting the light on this new world order.
[03:50:18.106 --> 03:50:22.249]  Um, no weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[03:50:22.249 --> 03:50:29.454]  And I mean, whether you're black, white, just the unity of it is really what's amazing about this movement of ours.
[03:50:29.454 --> 03:50:31.175]  And, um, I'm pretty new to it.
[03:50:31.175 --> 03:50:33.257]  I've watched Endgame and senior films.
[03:50:33.257 --> 03:50:37.940]  Um, my, my, my, my question was for Charlie, uh,
[03:50:39.664 --> 03:50:44.870]  Well, stay there, stay there, because I can tell you I'd probably answer it.
[03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:47.453]  Should have kept him longer, I probably could have, but I don't want to twist his arm.
[03:50:47.453 --> 03:50:47.793]  Stay there.
[03:50:47.793 --> 03:50:50.876]  We'll come back, finish up with you, then I'm going to hit this.
[03:50:50.876 --> 03:50:55.521]  Doctor says flu vaccine will cause 60,000 deaths in France alone.
[03:50:55.521 --> 03:50:58.705]  The inoculations start in a week and a half.
[03:50:58.705 --> 03:50:59.525]  So we're here.
[03:50:59.525 --> 03:50:59.826]  Stay there.
[03:51:02.307 --> 03:51:09.852]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:51:09.852 --> 03:51:14.355]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:51:14.355 --> 03:51:19.499]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.

[03:51:26.964 --> 03:51:31.347]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[03:51:31.627 --> 03:51:37.651]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:51:37.651 --> 03:51:44.597]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[03:52:01.920 --> 03:52:07.724]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:07.724 --> 03:52:15.308]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:15.308 --> 03:52:21.472]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.832 --> 03:52:23.874]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.874 --> 03:52:26.376]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.376 --> 03:52:37.946]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:37.946 --> 03:52:39.628]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.628 --> 03:52:41.489]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.489 --> 03:52:47.715]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:53:17.745 --> 03:53:22.508]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[03:53:22.508 --> 03:53:26.430]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.

[03:54:17.595 --> 03:54:18.596]  Quinn!
[03:54:18.596 --> 03:54:22.739]  Then we'll get to Tom, Jock, Michael, Charles and others tomorrow if you call us back.
[03:54:22.739 --> 03:54:24.220]  Always like hearing from Charles, Louisiana.
[03:54:24.220 --> 03:54:25.521]  That's my man calling.
[03:54:25.521 --> 03:54:27.082]  I may try to cram Charles in too.
[03:54:27.082 --> 03:54:29.624]  I've just got to hit this other flu news.
[03:54:29.624 --> 03:54:31.085]  Finishing up what you were saying, Quinn.
[03:54:32.521 --> 03:54:33.821]  Uh, yes.
[03:54:33.821 --> 03:54:51.807]  What I was saying, and what I've been observing, particularly with Fox News and the left-right paradigm, Glenn Beck, is Glenn Beck going to be a prototype of the 2012 candidate to come against Obama, where you have someone who's running on our issues, essentially hijacking us?
[03:54:51.807 --> 03:54:54.748]  Yes.
[03:54:54.748 --> 03:54:55.288]  Exactly.
[03:54:55.288 --> 03:54:56.148]  No, that's what it is.
[03:54:56.148 --> 03:55:01.270]  And then he'll be in control of the revolution, and then he will deliver us right into a Republican's hand.
[03:55:03.877 --> 03:55:14.522]  Either Obama, they were thinking about closing the doors on us with Obama, but because we shot down his cult of personality, it may be the next guy that's going to be the real dictator.
[03:55:14.522 --> 03:55:15.062]  Wow.
[03:55:15.062 --> 03:55:15.723]  Okay.
[03:55:15.723 --> 03:55:16.883]  Yeah.
[03:55:16.883 --> 03:55:19.144]  That's how the scam works.
[03:55:19.144 --> 03:55:20.505]  Yeah.
[03:55:20.505 --> 03:55:26.128]  I mean, in 2012, do you see a new consciousness coming in that year?
[03:55:26.128 --> 03:55:29.630]  I'm making a film about 2012, and it's a very sophisticated issue.
[03:55:29.630 --> 03:55:32.171]  I appreciate your call, Quinn, in Texas.
[03:55:34.335 --> 03:55:37.857]  Yes, there is a big awakening happening, but the elite have another meaning for that.
[03:55:37.857 --> 03:55:40.258]  I'm going to cover it later.
[03:55:40.258 --> 03:55:41.759]  Charles in Louisiana, very quickly.
[03:55:41.759 --> 03:55:43.220]  Go ahead, Charles.
[03:55:43.220 --> 03:55:44.701]  How are you doing?
[03:55:44.701 --> 03:55:45.281]  Good, buddy.
[03:55:45.281 --> 03:55:47.242]  What did you think of Charlie and his courage?
[03:55:47.242 --> 03:55:50.364]  Well, I commend him.
[03:55:50.364 --> 03:55:52.305]  I've met a lot of strong men.
[03:55:52.305 --> 03:55:56.208]  I think he's one of the bravest men I've ever met in my life.
[03:55:56.208 --> 03:55:59.209]  And I've been with the baddest.
[03:55:59.209 --> 03:56:01.050]  And I just want to commend you.
[03:56:01.050 --> 03:56:02.311]  You never gave up, Alex.
[03:56:02.311 --> 03:56:03.552]  You was always there.
[03:56:04.215 --> 03:56:08.897]  People might criticize you, but they're never co-working issues.
[03:56:08.897 --> 03:56:10.038]  They're never co-working issues.
[03:56:10.038 --> 03:56:11.799]  Well, I never claimed to be perfect.
[03:56:11.799 --> 03:56:12.519]  Lord knows I'm not.
[03:56:12.519 --> 03:56:15.120]  Yeah, you're not perfect, but you are a hero.
[03:56:15.120 --> 03:56:16.081]  You are a hero, okay?
[03:56:16.081 --> 03:56:18.122]  You're my hero.
[03:56:18.122 --> 03:56:22.704]  And I just thank you for what you're doing, and I hope to God that we get this country back.
[03:56:22.704 --> 03:56:25.485]  And I want to thank everybody who went to Washington, D.C.
[03:56:25.485 --> 03:56:27.466]  I didn't, but I didn't have the money.
[03:56:27.466 --> 03:56:31.408]  But I want to thank everybody who went there, and everybody who's fighting.
[03:56:31.408 --> 03:56:32.989]  God bless America, Mr. Jones.
[03:56:33.925 --> 03:56:35.910]  And thank you for going over.
[03:56:35.910 --> 03:56:39.119]  Well I tried, Charles, and thank you, and I'll try to do the best job I can.
[03:56:39.119 --> 03:56:40.783]  I know everybody's counting on me.
[03:56:40.783 --> 03:56:41.445]  It's quite a wait.
[03:56:42.537 --> 03:56:52.700]  Cause I never thought I'd be in this position and just so sick all the lies and twisting and we know the past flu shots have killed people and we know the Gardasil's killing people.
[03:56:52.700 --> 03:56:54.701]  We know they're jacking the water full of stuff.
[03:56:54.701 --> 03:56:57.142]  I mean, I just want this not, I want this ride to stop.
[03:56:57.142 --> 03:56:59.502]  It's like I'm on a roller coaster and just won't stop.
[03:56:59.502 --> 03:57:06.205]  And I'm telling the guy in the black ski mask, you know, the executioner to stop, you know, let me off and he won't let me off.
[03:57:06.205 --> 03:57:07.105]  And I'm tired of it.
[03:57:08.183 --> 03:57:13.549]  I don't know how in the world people that serve this government go along with this evil, because it isn't cute.
[03:57:13.549 --> 03:57:16.753]  Anybody who's got little kids, I don't know how you don't fight this.
[03:57:18.325 --> 03:57:19.846]  I want to get this doctor on, by the way.
[03:57:19.846 --> 03:57:21.846]  We're working on getting him on.
[03:57:21.846 --> 03:57:35.232]  Dr. Marc Girard, a specialist with the Side Effects of Drugs and Medical Expert Commission by the French Courts, has said on French TV that the swine flu vaccine could cause 60,000 deaths in France, especially among younger people, children and pregnant women.
[03:57:35.232 --> 03:57:40.694]  He also said the people promoting the swine flu vaccine are doing so because they have links with pharmaceutical companies.
[03:57:40.694 --> 03:57:42.335]  We're going to play this tomorrow.
[03:57:42.335 --> 03:57:44.396]  Maybe have my wife translate it into English.
[03:57:45.316 --> 03:57:54.498]  The problem with the swine flu vaccine is that it's not just badly developed, but not developed, he said, adding that it's being prepared in conditions that endanger the public health.
[03:57:54.498 --> 03:58:01.319]  Just like the German news is reporting about the cancer viruses in it in Build Magazine newspaper.
[03:58:01.319 --> 03:58:02.219]  And it just goes on.
[03:58:02.219 --> 03:58:05.120]  I'm going to start the show with this tomorrow.

[03:58:08.961 --> 03:58:10.261]  Great job to Charlie Sheen.

[03:58:51.514 --> 03:58:56.716]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:58:56.716 --> 03:59:00.758]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.758 --> 03:59:06.341]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:06.641 --> 03:59:07.301]  It's true.
[03:59:07.301 --> 03:59:12.644]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:12.644 --> 03:59:18.926]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:59:18.926 --> 03:59:21.827]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:59:21.827 --> 03:59:26.349]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:26.349 --> 03:59:29.971]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:59:30.191 --> 03:59:35.933]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
