[01:25.140 --> 01:30.340]  a whole bunch of different cable networks and channels but they refuse to debate him
[01:30.340 --> 01:35.020]  or even have him on now you know for ratings that it would be good to have him on but they
[01:35.020 --> 01:41.140]  cannot have him on with the points he would make like six of the 10 9-11 commissioners
[01:41.140 --> 01:48.940]  say that the commission was a quote fraud a cover-up that the Pentagon was hiding information
[01:48.940 --> 01:56.980]  and lying that there should be a criminal investigation that's just one of the 20 bullet
[01:56.980 --> 02:02.220]  points that Sheen wrote his letter to the president trying to get the people to look
[02:02.220 --> 02:07.780]  at and the public has looked at it tens of millions of people have read conservatively
[02:07.780 --> 02:14.300]  his 20 minutes with the president there are conservatively more than two million views

[02:18.780 --> 02:27.220]  alone close to 600,000 views and so certainly this has been a big victory for 9-11 truth

[03:19.060 --> 03:22.740]  20 minutes today because he wrote an excellent article about this latest fake bin Laden tape
[03:22.740 --> 03:28.700]  put up by the Intel Center thought would get his response to all of that also from Pennsylvania

[03:43.660 --> 03:50.780]  take people's blood it has nothing to do with DWI they're creating special medical cores
[03:50.780 --> 03:58.260]  of the police to take blood for national DNA databases England's already done it if you

[08:37.900 --> 08:43.340]  phones but I wanted to start the show with this just to illustrate things I heard local
[08:43.340 --> 08:56.660]  talk radio freaking out over this report and I went and looked it up and sure enough it
[08:56.660 --> 09:01.460]  was a accurate rundown that I was hearing on the radio but the issue is why were the
[09:01.460 --> 09:07.100]  callers and the talk show host getting upset about something that's done to third fourth
[09:07.100 --> 09:19.460]  and fifth grade children all over the United States under federal grants the police come
[09:19.460 --> 09:25.020]  into schools unannounced and tell children their hostages tell teachers put their hands
[09:25.020 --> 09:29.100]  behind their heads they're going to die I remember a Minnesota case the woman literally
[09:29.100 --> 09:33.140]  is a mental patient now and took her out in the woods to quote shooter in the back of
[09:33.140 --> 09:38.780]  the head they have drills in Michigan where the feds in the local civil the feds told
[09:38.780 --> 09:43.620]  us to do it they gave us the money they tell the school kids the third and fourth graders
[09:43.620 --> 09:50.300]  in this one case that home schoolers were coming to kill them and men in camouflage
[09:50.300 --> 09:54.980]  marched them outside set off smoke grenades put guns to the back of their heads and threw
[09:54.980 --> 10:01.980]  fake blood on them and this goes on everywhere this is mind control this is trauma based
[10:01.980 --> 10:09.460]  mind control this is reeducation camp type stuff fake robbery prompts real lawsuit associated
[10:09.460 --> 10:17.860]  press employee sues for PTSD claiming gunman hired to stick up pharmacy was part of unannounced
[10:17.860 --> 10:23.580]  training drill of course because you get a discount on your insurance a new jersey pharmacy

[10:28.620 --> 10:35.860]  oxy cotton is suing her employers for arranging the mock hold up but bet Perry says in a lawsuit
[10:35.860 --> 10:42.060]  that she was told in advance of the drill in December 2007 at the Hampton behavioral
[10:42.060 --> 10:46.460]  health center she says she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after the gunman
[10:46.460 --> 10:52.340]  entered the store claiming he had taken another host worker hostage she says she tried to
[10:52.340 --> 10:56.460]  call for help but the phone wasn't working she later found out the gun was faking the
[10:56.460 --> 11:02.020]  gunman work for the company Perry is seeking damages for the health center and its parent
[11:02.020 --> 11:09.620]  company universal health services ink of king of prussia pennsylvania the general counsel
[11:09.620 --> 11:16.460]  for universal declined a comment on the case okay now why is this a big deal i mean if
[11:16.460 --> 11:22.700]  we can do it to first second third fourth fifth sixth seventh graders for the last decade
[11:22.700 --> 11:31.740]  at least since Columbine if they can hire former navy seals to practice taking over
[11:31.740 --> 11:40.260]  dallas schools in fact in one drill in fort worth the cops shot the other cop who happened
[11:40.260 --> 11:44.780]  to be cop of the year in the back of his head in front of the school kids blowing his brains

[12:06.060 --> 12:11.620]  back but thank god they shot him in the buttocks and in killing and then they have real drills
[12:11.620 --> 12:15.860]  where they come in everybody will line up like it's a shake down the super max prison
[12:15.860 --> 12:20.020]  and they throw everybody stuff out of the lockers and dogs will grab their bag and shake
[12:20.020 --> 12:24.460]  it or rip their clothes off and the kids cry and the police laugh it's all part of being
[12:24.460 --> 12:31.380]  trained to be a prisoner i'll never forget we had a lady and her lawyer on it was in
[12:31.380 --> 12:37.500]  the pioneer press up in minneapolis st paul that was a what eighth grade class and she
[12:37.500 --> 12:43.580]  was in a portable building in the art class i remember school i remember once when i had
[12:43.580 --> 12:47.980]  an art class was in a portable building out by a wooded area out back to school in the
[12:47.980 --> 12:53.860]  back 40 and the police came in and dressed as terrorists and said we're going to kill
[12:53.860 --> 12:57.860]  you and they took the kids and the teacher outside and it said the kids defecated on
[12:57.860 --> 13:02.780]  themselves urinated on themselves the teacher collapsed and then this one on for about an
[13:02.780 --> 13:08.380]  hour and then they didn't kill them dressed as terrorists and nobody gets in trouble because
[13:08.380 --> 13:13.220]  the schools are for trauma-based mind control and it's trauma-based mind control and the
[13:13.220 --> 13:19.060]  police to train them all of this is normal government does asinine over the top things
[13:19.060 --> 13:36.660]  to set precedence here is a another a p article preventive terror raids
[13:36.660 --> 13:52.580]  preventive terror raids targets new york city apartments preventive terror raids targets
[13:52.580 --> 14:02.820]  nyc apartments remember bill clinton said on that mtv show in 1992 when he was running

[14:09.460 --> 14:17.620]  housing facilities looking for illegal guns that's right no more fourth amendment no more
[14:17.620 --> 14:22.580]  fifth amendment we just come in and do what we want when we want the investigation of
[14:22.580 --> 14:28.460]  suspected al-qaeda associate prompted the preemptive raid it's like preemptive wars of three new
[14:28.460 --> 14:33.780]  york city apartments but authority said the target of any terror attack plan remained unclear
[14:33.780 --> 14:39.180]  just it's preemptive it's preventive it's just random we have no evidence it's unclear
[14:39.180 --> 14:42.860]  but we're just going to search you the search is early monday came after the man who was
[14:42.860 --> 14:46.820]  under surveillance for possible links to the terrorism network visited new york city over
[14:46.820 --> 14:53.540]  the weekend and left the areas of representative peter king senator charles schumer said law
[14:53.540 --> 14:57.980]  enforcement action was unrelated to president barack obama's visit to the city monday or
[14:57.980 --> 15:02.820]  the fake flyover they did through dc with air force one or the whole fake thing with
[15:02.820 --> 15:11.640]  the patrol boats last last friday and now it's updated five new york homes not just
[15:11.640 --> 15:18.900]  apartments rated in terrorism probe says no imminent danger focus on one man who met with

[15:24.740 --> 15:36.580]  sympathetic al-qaeda detected so that's the type of news that we have on that front meanwhile
[15:36.580 --> 15:43.340]  all these states i'm gonna cover this after we take some calls multiple states every time
[15:43.340 --> 15:48.940]  i look at a state you can just google the name of your state i did texas i did pennsylvania
[15:48.940 --> 15:58.100]  i did ohio i did new york i did florida and every time i searched the term ohio pennsylvania
[15:58.100 --> 16:02.340]  whatever the case was so i don't know of every fit i don't know of all fifty have done this
[16:02.340 --> 16:09.500]  but i know it's always federal grants i know texas has done it this year but every state
[16:09.500 --> 16:13.700]  i randomly checked last night spent about twenty minutes on it if you just search the
[16:13.700 --> 16:18.620]  name of your state and police to draw blood without warrant or new law police to draw
[16:18.620 --> 16:25.380]  blood without warrant that's what i found and i found the statesman headline police draw
[16:25.380 --> 16:29.740]  blood without warrant for first time that was the austin american statesman headline
[16:29.740 --> 16:34.980]  last week and they've got mobile rvs see first and i told you this is for acclimation just
[16:34.980 --> 16:40.100]  to have no warrants first the feds would have the police go get these rubber stamp fake
[16:40.100 --> 16:45.820]  warrants from a judge that just said stake any blood you want not listing the person
[16:45.820 --> 16:51.140]  in their places to be searched you know just totally fake this judge is just swearing out
[16:51.140 --> 16:55.940]  rubber stamp warrants just like they did with the warrants wiretaps they just had random
[16:55.940 --> 17:03.940]  warrants for millions of people these letters of mark on our freedoms well after they got
[17:03.940 --> 17:10.060]  done and you accepted that well hell why not just go ahead and have no warrants and some
[17:10.060 --> 17:19.740]  states say if there's a kid in the car or if it's dark or if you've got a prior dwi
[17:19.740 --> 17:24.500]  but if you read the way the laws are written some states just say no more warrants period
[17:24.500 --> 17:30.100]  other states have these wide you know reasons and then and then next year they'll or the
[17:30.100 --> 17:33.780]  next time your legislatures in session they'll just say they can put you in a ditch and shoot
[17:33.780 --> 17:38.060]  you in the back of the head i mean that's already chicago and illinois have said if
[17:38.060 --> 17:43.100]  you run we're gonna kill you if you run from a traffic stop if you don't stop immediately
[17:43.100 --> 17:48.460]  we're gonna gun you down remember that headline cbs news like it was good and people were

[18:04.380 --> 18:08.220]  right in china and in russia i've looked at their laws they have more freedoms on the
[18:08.220 --> 18:15.740]  books than we do we are in major university studies number six worst police state in the
[18:15.740 --> 18:20.860]  world we've still got free speech but they're openly announcing they're gonna start getting

[24:28.700 --> 24:33.020]  at checkpoints it's it's like a bully when you're 10 years old and the 14 year old bully
[24:33.020 --> 24:37.540]  beats you up and wrestles you to the ground and then sits on top of your chest and spits
[24:37.540 --> 24:44.780]  in your face I had a couple bullies do that to me it must be like their specialty and I've
[24:44.780 --> 24:49.060]  been told by others they had bullied you that to them now later when you get a little bit
[24:49.060 --> 24:53.180]  older and you put the bully in the hospital it's not funny when you actually break their
[24:53.180 --> 24:59.940]  nose and knock their teeth out but then they whine and try to sue you and you know that's
[24:59.940 --> 25:03.660]  how it always works when they're spitting up teeth and it's gonna be the same way with
[25:03.660 --> 25:09.620]  the government the government's just squatting on it's going on a steel 23.7 trillion and
[25:09.620 --> 25:15.060]  I'm gonna take your blood at checkpoints because it's to stop the drunk drivers when they admit
[25:15.060 --> 25:24.780]  that people on psychotropic drugs are killing three times what the drunk drivers are texting
[25:24.780 --> 25:32.380]  kills twice what the drugs do but see it's always oh we don't we're not going to get
[25:32.380 --> 25:37.340]  a warrant I mean they could have a judge there and swear out a real war but they don't want
[25:37.340 --> 25:43.060]  to do that and the feds paid to do this because they want to set the precedent to take fluid
[25:43.060 --> 25:48.420]  out of your body there's an international treaty to set up a worldwide DNA database
[25:48.420 --> 25:52.180]  and you can say well drunk drivers deserve it we should get rid of the Bill of Rights
[25:52.180 --> 25:57.140]  okay fine for sake of argument you believe it fine what about newborn babies do they
[25:57.140 --> 26:05.780]  deserve it because for 36 almost 37 years and I broke this 13 years ago and it's now
[26:05.780 --> 26:12.420]  mainstream news admitted they take your blood at birth and put it in a UN database University
[26:12.420 --> 26:19.220]  of Texas runs all the southwest states in Texas and Oklahoma it keeps all the blood
[26:19.220 --> 26:28.260]  going back to 1973 keeps all your blood for eugenics and research and they admitted all
[26:28.260 --> 26:34.940]  now I'll never forget earlier this year was it in January I almost fell out of my chair
[26:34.940 --> 26:39.060]  on the Sunday show I was doing the Sunday show on a news radio 590 K.L.B.J. at the time
[26:39.060 --> 26:44.580]  we now do it out of my studio so we can also simulcast at chrismplanet.tv and I heard
[26:44.580 --> 26:52.180]  Sarah Hudaberg the great news girl over there reporting that they take everybody's blood
[26:52.180 --> 26:56.380]  at birth for a DNA database and that it's studied and used for international research
[26:56.380 --> 26:59.420]  and I almost fell out of my chair and I ran out and she came out of the news booth and
[26:59.420 --> 27:03.060]  I said how do you know about that well because I was always called a conspiracy terrorist
[27:03.060 --> 27:06.580]  for having actual government documents and she said oh it's in the front page the Austin
[27:06.580 --> 27:11.380]  America statesman here it is and she handed it to me and it was all how great it was they
[27:11.380 --> 27:21.300]  take your blood and how sweety cake it is and you like to give your blood and pay to
[27:21.300 --> 27:28.900]  have your blood done for international registry with national geographic and IBM sponsoring
[27:28.900 --> 27:36.220]  it at the cold springs harbor human genome project if you go look up cold springs harbor
[27:36.220 --> 27:40.620]  that's where eugenics was started it's still the eugenics office and all the people that
[27:40.620 --> 27:45.420]  work there all the head scientist on record published books on eugenics and they've got
[27:45.420 --> 27:52.500]  your blood history now and they have been studying Israel South Africa the United States
[27:52.500 --> 27:57.220]  France and England and James weapons quarterly's been reporting for years speaking of the statesman
[27:57.220 --> 28:01.700]  they wrote an article about Cheney's PNAC documents September 20th 2000 where Cheney
[28:01.700 --> 28:07.300]  says we've really got to learn how to use race specific bio weapons and condition the
[28:07.300 --> 28:13.420]  public through the media to accept going after certain races let's see everybody's
[28:13.420 --> 28:19.660]  interrelated and so they're studying the different migration lines and different gene markers
[28:19.660 --> 28:26.260]  to really get those race specific bio weapons tailored and you're helping them so much and
[28:26.260 --> 28:31.140]  your baby's blood is going to help them so much and then see now if the police didn't
[28:31.140 --> 28:34.580]  have your DNA database or it wasn't stored properly or you weren't born in the right
[28:34.580 --> 28:40.780]  hospital or you're older than 36 they could just have their local federalized police pull
[28:40.780 --> 28:44.940]  you over and claim it's a DUI that they think you're drinking and they're going to take
[28:44.940 --> 28:54.420]  your blood and then now they can make a race specific virus just for Bill Jones or just
[28:54.420 --> 29:03.940]  for Tom Smith or just for Carol Johnson or Daryl Swartz or whatever the fictitious name
[29:03.940 --> 29:10.700]  is oh isn't that sweet and in the future the local federalized police can pull you over
[29:10.700 --> 29:14.660]  they already have hit team police on every major department work for the feds on record
[29:14.660 --> 29:17.820]  they can pull you over and put that needle in you and it's going to have the race specific
[29:17.820 --> 29:23.740]  bio weapon already on it because see now they're medicalized police now they've set the precedent
[29:23.740 --> 29:29.740]  to get into your body and forcibly inoculate you and take you to relocation centers and
[29:29.740 --> 29:34.140]  break up your family as the clergy response team and in for guard people been trained

[32:04.820 --> 32:08.860]  he got laid off from a job he loved many years ago he was devastated but it taught him a
[32:08.860 --> 32:13.580]  lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells
[32:13.580 --> 32:17.860]  you how much he appreciates you every day there is no job security you are always in
[32:17.860 --> 32:22.500]  danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own
[32:22.500 --> 32:28.100]  business since you are the boss nobody can fire you so MZ has been his own boss for over
[32:28.100 --> 32:33.580]  37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits
[32:33.580 --> 32:38.460]  of working for themselves and not for others MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home
[32:38.460 --> 32:42.420]  business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help

[33:30.620 --> 33:39.500]  U.S. deaths remember that well I have another headline German doctor says swine flu vaccine
[33:39.500 --> 33:46.940]  could kill as many as 60,000 people that is coming up and the fact that major German news
[33:46.940 --> 33:50.940]  is reporting that the vaccine does have live cancer virus in it all right I'm going to
[33:50.940 --> 33:54.940]  take your calls so we get to a lot of calls we have each caller about a minute no matter
[33:54.940 --> 34:01.900]  how important your info is that we get to the next person 1-800-259-9231 is the toll
[34:01.900 --> 34:07.620]  free number to join us Adam in Texas Adam you're on the air yeah I've been listening
[34:07.620 --> 34:13.700]  to you for a couple of years and I do value a lot of the information that you put forth
[34:13.700 --> 34:23.700]  however I wanted to kind of disagree with the DHS girl scout awareness patches that
[34:23.700 --> 34:30.420]  they've teamed up with to give to girl scouts it's you know my daughter's in the girl scout
[34:30.420 --> 34:38.340]  and this patch is really just an awareness and preparedness of how to deal with natural
[34:38.340 --> 34:44.100]  disasters or other disasters for instance my daughter is working on the hurricane awareness
[34:44.100 --> 34:48.820]  patch which is one of the ones that was for the no no I understand sir do you know how
[34:48.820 --> 34:57.740]  you domesticate wild hogs no I don't well you put out grain you put a feeder out for
[34:57.740 --> 35:03.740]  a month with with grain or little range cubelets that come out that's like candy to him and
[35:03.740 --> 35:07.900]  then you put a little fence up that has a gate around it after you've had it without
[35:07.900 --> 35:13.860]  a gate for a month and then you put a timer on the gate after about another month to where
[35:13.860 --> 35:20.980]  when all the hogs are in there waiting for it to go off at 6am the gate swings shut and
[35:20.980 --> 35:25.540]  then you can pull up and either machine gun the hogs the wild hogs are destroying your
[35:25.540 --> 35:35.100]  your crops or you can try to hurt them into a smaller pin and then haul them off and fatten
[35:35.100 --> 35:42.660]  them up for sale now that's what's going on with this the white house says they want
[35:42.660 --> 35:47.660]  national compulsory service for school children rama manuals written a book and talked about
[35:47.660 --> 35:54.260]  on c span the president has they've introduced bills to do it that we've listed obviously
[35:54.260 --> 36:00.820]  when you hear about the patch and emergency man made and natural disasters and quote helping
[36:00.820 --> 36:05.140]  their parents and their communities understand the importance of readiness that's a quote
[36:05.140 --> 36:10.780]  from a fb and the director lady that directs girl scouts of america that that is to acclimate
[36:10.780 --> 36:17.340]  them obviously the first federalization of girl scouts the 3.4 million is going to sound
[36:17.340 --> 36:26.660]  reasonable just like we saw what happened with obama wanting to speak to the kids the
[36:26.660 --> 36:31.900]  original speech and the original lesson plan said how you're going to help the president
[36:31.900 --> 36:36.140]  and you're going to write him letters about promising to help him and going under their
[36:36.140 --> 36:41.580]  control then once there was heat he came out and gave a milk toast speech and people say
[36:41.580 --> 36:48.620]  what you know what's the big deal so that did you do you know how hitlers hitler you
[36:48.620 --> 37:02.580]  again hitler youth started sir i mean i've read various books about how certain certain
[37:02.580 --> 37:08.940]  programs were implemented to make people quote unquote aware of certain things and i mean
[37:08.940 --> 37:15.060]  but let me tell you how it started okay this is mainline history every major documentary
[37:15.060 --> 37:20.620]  about the the history of the nazis will will tell you that the nazis beat the other political
[37:20.620 --> 37:26.860]  parties because they knew how to make it fun and they created their own boy scouts and
[37:26.860 --> 37:32.740]  they had parties and games and playing chess and wrestling and sword fights with wooden
[37:32.740 --> 37:39.620]  swords and camping and the nazis knew how to have fun and biking and backpacking and
[37:39.620 --> 37:45.140]  skiing and the nazis paid for it all and then the first thing hitler did in 33 when he took
[37:45.140 --> 37:50.820]  over is he took over the boy scouts of germany boy scouts actually started in germany in
[37:50.820 --> 37:55.740]  austria not in the united states we got it from them and the keizers before them created
[37:55.740 --> 38:00.820]  it as a paramilitary training group hitler took that over our boy scouts were founded
[38:00.820 --> 38:07.580]  by the federal government as well to create a paramilitary trained group so just sir you
[38:07.580 --> 38:12.260]  just don't know the history i understand it's been made to look palatable i know it's been
[38:12.260 --> 38:19.100]  made to look reasonable but i'm telling you it's not well i mean i i'm very aware of
[38:19.100 --> 38:24.620]  a lot of the psychops that that have been going on i've researched this stuff diligently
[38:24.620 --> 38:31.860]  over the past three years i just i mean you read the document of how to achieve this patch
[38:31.860 --> 38:37.980]  there's no title telling there's not there's none of that it's it's it's research that's
[38:37.980 --> 38:43.940]  parent based parent directed let me stop you again let me stop you again three years ago
[38:43.940 --> 38:49.700]  i got criticized because they started the same program with the boy scouts of america and
[38:49.700 --> 38:53.300]  i told everybody i said in the next few years they're going to start training them because
[38:53.300 --> 38:59.700]  i know what the secure core division of americor training is because i'd already seen it under
[38:59.700 --> 39:06.980]  bush in the philadelphia daily news then i got to move on with you sir have you seen the
[39:06.980 --> 39:12.900]  new york times with the the boy scouts training with m16 to quote take on disgruntled gun owning
[39:12.900 --> 39:18.180]  veterans and seek and destroy emissions i have and that's quite disturbing okay well your
[39:18.180 --> 39:23.700]  daughter in three years will be will be training to spy on your neighbors period but hey call
[39:23.700 --> 39:29.140]  me back in three years when i'm right probably too late then but so what i mean sir believe
[39:29.140 --> 39:37.460]  me i'm not criticizing you or your daughter the first time you know a ponzi scheme works
[39:37.460 --> 39:42.340]  the first few people that get into the ponzi scheme make huge returns of 20 30 40 percent
[39:42.900 --> 39:47.540]  to then con everybody else does a fish hook have a big juicy worm on it
[39:50.020 --> 39:54.500]  if you're a fish does a big juicy worm a big night crawler on the end of that hook does it
[39:54.500 --> 40:01.220]  look plump and delicious probably i'm sure it does okay well i'm telling you sir it's bait
[40:02.420 --> 40:08.420]  it's bait of course they're gonna make the first program getting the homeland security and fema
[40:08.420 --> 40:12.580]  has no business uh involved with your daughter sir
[40:15.220 --> 40:21.860]  uh you know to a certain extent you're right alex i mean that you know it that the combination
[40:21.860 --> 40:31.300]  should probably not be and i do see it as kind of a uh what your analogy of the bait on the fish
[40:31.300 --> 40:37.220]  hook however if there were something behind it i would give it more credence but like i said
[40:37.220 --> 40:42.660]  reading the documents looking at what it is you know i live in houston where we were hit by a
[40:42.660 --> 40:48.340]  hurricane last year no i understand it's great to teach kids values and i i gotta let you go
[40:48.340 --> 40:54.100]  so you know if you want to write an article countering us i'd probably publish it at writers
[40:54.100 --> 41:00.820]  and info wars dot com go ahead okay i mean sir they come out with something that sounds
[41:00.820 --> 41:06.820]  reasonable at first to acclimate you so that anyone that knows history and warns people sounds
[41:06.820 --> 41:15.940]  like a kook and then next sir this is how secure core and americor and clergy response team and
[41:15.940 --> 41:21.060]  infregards started i told you last year they were gonna announce that homeland security was
[41:21.060 --> 41:26.660]  going to put trips on the streets and then they said yeah 4 000 trips and then 20 000 and 40 000
[41:26.660 --> 41:34.500]  they announced 379 000 two weeks ago they've got the marines and the army outrunning checkpoints
[41:35.620 --> 41:42.900]  quote looking for drunk drivers without warrants totally illegal and why so that when people
[41:42.900 --> 41:47.060]  say hey we don't want the army and marine corps outrunning checkpoints people say well what's
[41:47.060 --> 41:53.940]  wrong with that they're stopping drunk drivers what's wrong with my nine-year-old daughter
[41:53.940 --> 42:00.100]  you know learning and getting a relationship with fema and homeland security you know they're
[42:00.100 --> 42:10.580]  just helping with hurricanes oh god help us you're being acclimated when homeland security is out
[42:10.580 --> 42:16.340]  with the jaws of life helicopters land and they start airvacking people that's for pr purposes
[42:17.860 --> 42:23.300]  i've been to the urban warfare drills they're training to take over our city halls our county
[42:23.300 --> 42:28.580]  courthouses if the locals don't go along with it they're trained to go in and shoot the local police
[42:28.580 --> 42:34.980]  and throw hangar nades through the windows okay the troops are training to throw hangar nades
[42:34.980 --> 42:39.860]  in your local police stations window if they don't go along with it you understand that
[42:39.860 --> 42:44.660]  that north com and the john warner defense authorization act states that north com and
[42:44.660 --> 42:51.060]  homeland security are there to sweep the governors aside if they don't do what they're told do you
[42:51.060 --> 42:56.900]  know what's happening buddy have you seen everything i've talked about in the past come through
[42:57.940 --> 43:01.620]  how do people sit there and gullibly take the acclimation
[43:01.620 --> 43:10.020]  the marine corps doesn't give a hoot about drunk drivers i will assure you
[43:10.580 --> 43:16.980]  they're there to acclimate the marine corps and the regular marine corps regular active duty not
[43:16.980 --> 43:24.260]  reserves take tennessee regular army with homeland security with a national guard searching everybody's
[43:24.260 --> 43:32.980]  cars the governor says don't do it they still do it folks do you know what's going on around you
[43:33.860 --> 43:36.580]  do you understand you're being acclimated to all this stuff
[43:38.740 --> 43:43.140]  but again you identify your daughter as the girl scouts and it's over it's sick
[43:44.420 --> 43:48.580]  and you know the preachers have been trained i told you a year and a half before it was in
[43:48.580 --> 43:52.260]  mainstream news they'd train the preachers to tell their flocks to turn their guns in and go to
[43:52.260 --> 43:58.740]  fema camps and now it's mainstream news and you've got these people trained to be these little
[43:58.740 --> 44:04.980]  do-gooders who just totally trust government and do whatever they say i said i take a lot of your
[44:04.980 --> 44:08.900]  calls just that guy brought up a heavy-duty issue jack in florida jack you're on the air
[44:10.340 --> 44:16.980]  hello elix go ahead welcome i believe all of it's probably just a big psalms like operation
[44:16.980 --> 44:23.540]  monkenberg and everything from the girl scouts all the way all of it anyway what i'm calling

[45:55.780 --> 45:59.940]  i'll have to talk to you here i'd like to hear you go over uh maybe 10 of the
[46:01.140 --> 46:05.940]  10 of the issues that's going on right now i mean just all of it seemed like it's coming
[46:05.940 --> 46:13.460]  to a head at once it is thank you so much i appreciate your call uh look the flu being
[46:13.460 --> 46:21.300]  used as a federal takeover cover the forced inoculations the deaths and illnesses associated
[46:21.300 --> 46:28.260]  with the vaccine uh the new bank of the world being shut up further expansion of control over
[46:28.260 --> 46:36.420]  banking uh israel talking about openly hitting iran in the next few months all these different
[46:36.420 --> 46:42.660]  pieces of legislation restrict free speech the military openly announcing that they're doing
[46:42.660 --> 46:49.220]  more and more deployments inside the united states openly acclimating the public government sponsored
[46:49.220 --> 46:56.500]  terror is definitely in the cards they need that but yes the march to end the fed um
[46:56.500 --> 47:02.820]  um i talk about that every day i talked about it for an hour yesterday but i'm sorry i'll try to
[47:02.820 --> 47:09.460]  cover that more um because it is a very very central issue let's go ahead and talk to lenny
[47:09.460 --> 47:14.980]  in new york lenny are on the air hey my girlfriend works at a hospital in new york and just received
[47:14.980 --> 47:19.860]  a nasty email notifying her that by november 30th it is mandatory to take the swine flu vaccination
[47:20.740 --> 47:26.020]  yes there's no law but they do have the executive order but you notice the president says we're not
[47:26.020 --> 47:31.700]  going to make you take it but the cdc and the world health organization the who's really in control
[47:31.700 --> 47:36.820]  the un's openly calling the shots worldwide and as they bragged a few months ago this is a great
[47:36.820 --> 47:42.100]  moment for global governance what's a global government takeover drill they're ordering
[47:42.100 --> 47:49.140]  firemen police nurses medical workers to take the shots in europe in england and the united
[47:49.140 --> 47:55.220]  states and canada i have seen those news articles and then obama gets up in lies and says you don't
[47:55.220 --> 48:04.100]  have to take it so they don't want to spook the public so we organize and say no to force an
[48:04.100 --> 48:08.180]  oculation so they just come to the public schools and say if you want to go to school you gotta take
[48:08.180 --> 48:13.220]  the flu shot there's no law and then they don't even announce it on the news they just do it all
[48:13.220 --> 48:18.260]  by cornering your kid when nobody's there to protect them or they do it by cornering the nurses
[48:18.260 --> 48:23.860]  but i saw a poll two months ago or 60 plus percent of new york nurses said they're not taking it so
[48:23.860 --> 48:28.580]  but again they'll try to individually corner you and if they ever get their bluff through
[48:28.580 --> 48:32.660]  and force first responders to do it they already traveled the smallpox in 2002
[48:33.300 --> 48:36.100]  then they're going to go ahead with the force in oculation against the public
[48:37.860 --> 48:42.420]  and then out in the open you'll guaranteed see a bunch of adverse reactions from the flu shot
[48:42.420 --> 48:47.860]  they have it from the regular one deaths and you name it and then they'll they'll call those deaths
[48:47.860 --> 48:53.620]  and illnesses from the vaccine the reason to get the shot saying the flu is causing it well what is
[48:53.620 --> 49:00.020]  your uh what is she saying about this email well she just got the email today she was calling me a
[49:00.020 --> 49:06.180]  kook in a creepy for telling the past few months that um you know because you had it in july you
[49:06.180 --> 49:11.780]  reported this um that by november 30th there's a new york state regulation that they're gonna
[49:11.780 --> 49:18.020]  you know force you to take it you lose your job or whatever well i mean it's not like you had to
[49:18.020 --> 49:25.780]  believe us it was it was in the new york news i mean we broke it first when we got sent an email
[49:25.780 --> 49:31.540]  the internal email by a male nurse in new york city but it came out like a week later i mean
[49:31.540 --> 49:36.180]  what what i mean she didn't believe the new york daily news and ap she thought they were al-qaeda
[49:36.180 --> 49:40.660]  or something well at first you know she thought anything that was on your website was you know
[49:41.220 --> 49:44.820]  fake or whatever but now now that it's in her first hand she's starting to realize it
[49:44.820 --> 49:52.980]  absolutely amazing uh so is she gonna roll her sleeve up and enjoy herself no no i've
[49:52.980 --> 49:56.740]  i've taught her not to i told her that you want to spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair

[55:49.220 --> 55:55.860]  mainstream media they they like to come out and attack him and put words in his mouth and lie
[55:55.860 --> 56:00.980]  about him and lie about his 20 points to the president and lie about his video to the president
[56:00.980 --> 56:10.020]  but they won't actually respond to what he actually said and so he challenged
[56:11.140 --> 56:16.340]  mccain's daughter that attacked him on the view he challenged bill o'reilly shan hannity rush limbaugh
[56:16.340 --> 56:24.580]  popper mechanics to a debate on live tv larry king live at first you know was talking to him and

[1:00:54.420 --> 1:00:58.740]  announcing in a few days late because i'm i'm trying to watch all the videos and i watched a
[1:00:58.740 --> 1:01:03.300]  bunch last night there's so many in fact i would ask curtain demo to just post them all in one area
[1:01:03.300 --> 1:01:07.060]  because i was searching around and i couldn't find some of the pages i found earlier we've gotten so
[1:01:07.060 --> 1:01:13.860]  many because i i i just want to judge these correctly uh but want to thank everybody for
[1:01:13.860 --> 1:01:18.740]  the great job they've done as well so that is coming up right now let's go ahead and go to
[1:01:18.740 --> 1:01:26.180]  your phone calls adam in texas oh no that's an old list karen in oregon you're on the air go ahead
[1:01:26.980 --> 1:01:33.620]  hi alex thank you so much for all you do and thank you for the the brilliance of helping charlie
[1:01:33.620 --> 1:01:39.140]  sheen with that letter to obama that's wonderful well i mean that was only a small part of it
[1:01:39.140 --> 1:01:44.100]  it was his live appearances the video message that the video message is the biggest thing we've done
[1:01:45.620 --> 1:01:52.660]  and it's working well now i have an idea that i would like to to float for you they seem to
[1:01:53.300 --> 1:01:58.820]  just make light of us when we try and show up they downplay the numbers they don't pay any
[1:01:58.820 --> 1:02:04.020]  attention to us it's a money game we keep losing and i'm thinking maybe we should go about it a
[1:02:04.020 --> 1:02:11.540]  different way like on the 15th of next month maybe all of us millions of us all across the country
[1:02:11.540 --> 1:02:18.420]  could withhold our dollars and not buy anything from large corporations that day and if we do it
[1:02:18.420 --> 1:02:24.180]  in massive enough numbers we can also pick up the phone and call congress and tell them we're keeping
[1:02:24.180 --> 1:02:29.460]  our dollars today we never gave you permission well i think i mean i think general strikes are
[1:02:29.460 --> 1:02:34.820]  always good to show the power of the people the problem is the real economy is a very small part
[1:02:34.820 --> 1:02:44.020]  of the financial reality the banks have created thousands of times fiat currency compared to what
[1:02:44.020 --> 1:02:52.180]  there really is in tangible property and so they've studied human developments and human
[1:02:52.180 --> 1:02:57.780]  societies and algorithms they know that we can do a strike for a few days but we'll just come back
[1:02:57.780 --> 1:03:04.820]  and end up spending just as much money later i'm not poo pooing your idea i'm just saying lots of
[1:03:04.820 --> 1:03:11.620]  different ideas lots of different systems of resistance are important but i do think it's
[1:03:11.620 --> 1:03:17.060]  important to more and more boycott mainstream media and just keep discrediting them they had a poll
[1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:23.220]  out that less than 30 of americans trust mainstream media and then americans trust alternative media
[1:03:23.220 --> 1:03:31.780]  more so they've already lost the people's trust well how about if we combine doing a strike if we
[1:03:31.780 --> 1:03:37.940]  buy the things that we need because governments can't give us clean air clean water healthy food
[1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:43.140]  or communities within which to live and thrive or integrity and those are really the things we need
[1:03:43.140 --> 1:03:49.460]  but we can give them to ourselves and if we collectively could withhold our dollars and
[1:03:49.460 --> 1:03:57.380]  possibly some of us even stay home consecutively and call up and let them know you you've turned
[1:03:57.380 --> 1:04:03.780]  our descendants into debt slaves before they're even born you're selling us out at every turn
[1:04:03.780 --> 1:04:10.740]  you're poisoning our air and our water you've taken our homes from us and our money let's stay home
[1:04:10.740 --> 1:04:17.460]  let's fortify ourselves within our homes on the 15th all of us millions of us don't you think we
[1:04:17.460 --> 1:04:23.300]  could have a shot at turning this without firing a shot using brains and not bullets and collectively
[1:04:23.940 --> 1:04:32.900]  millions of us millions of us staying home well sure i just don't have the power the listeners do
[1:04:32.900 --> 1:04:37.860]  if they really pushed it in a few months from now we you know to have a strike we've heard a lot
[1:04:37.860 --> 1:04:43.940]  about trucker strikes and things i just if you look at argentina they had strikes for six months a
[1:04:43.940 --> 1:04:49.780]  year but at the end of it they were all basically poor slaves they weren't first world anymore it's
[1:04:49.780 --> 1:04:53.460]  going to take more it's going to take taken over the counties the cities the states it's going to
[1:04:53.460 --> 1:04:58.580]  take abolishing the federal reserve it's going to take identifying the real enemy of humanity
[1:04:58.580 --> 1:05:04.100]  that's the number one thing the illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the

[1:08:56.740 --> 1:09:02.260]  burner and not just let the establishment put out new fake bin laden tapes and not just let
[1:09:02.260 --> 1:09:07.060]  the establishment have more fake terror raids remember it came out the cheney had done fake
[1:09:07.060 --> 1:09:12.020]  terror raids in new york wanted to use army against us citizens to set the precedent to
[1:09:12.020 --> 1:09:20.180]  use the army against the general public it's all about precedent setting with these lawyers
[1:09:22.340 --> 1:09:30.180]  and we've got a lot of other key news coming up today but paul watson wrote a story
[1:09:30.180 --> 1:09:35.700]  monday concerning this latest bin laden tape now others in the past have been proven to be fake
[1:09:35.700 --> 1:09:43.140]  the intel center is run by rumsfeld's former deputy an expert in psychological operations
[1:09:43.140 --> 1:09:47.540]  it has some other top cia personnel working there publicly who have been involved in
[1:09:47.540 --> 1:09:53.380]  psychological operations as well i mean this isn't just some normal cia person this is black ops
[1:09:53.380 --> 1:09:59.940]  they've been caught uploading intel center video with the audio before with the intel
[1:09:59.940 --> 1:10:06.020]  center logo and the same video layer as the alkyda logo well supposedly intel center should
[1:10:06.020 --> 1:10:11.700]  load theirs in later unless they produced it the graphics were produced at the same time
[1:10:12.340 --> 1:10:18.660]  laid on the video at the same time also voice prints been done of all these different bin
[1:10:18.660 --> 1:10:23.940]  laden tapes it's not bin laden when they check it with real bin laden tapes they just make a voice
[1:10:23.940 --> 1:10:30.420]  key a voice id with it it doesn't pass then they've had linguists listen it's not the sum of bin
[1:10:30.420 --> 1:10:38.420]  laden so i wanted to get him on about that subject paul watson joining us from prisonplanet.com
[1:10:38.420 --> 1:10:45.380]  good to have you on with us paul good to be back elix okay break down some of the history of this
[1:10:45.940 --> 1:10:48.980]  and some of the other fake tapes and let's look at this newest tape
[1:10:48.980 --> 1:10:58.100]  well there's there's so many aspects to this elix but the key thing about it historically is that
[1:10:58.900 --> 1:11:06.660]  the emergence of bin laden tapes or alkyda tapes or adam pilman tapes or alzohiri tapes
[1:11:07.620 --> 1:11:15.700]  repeatedly and i mean in every single case basically coincide their release coincides
[1:11:15.700 --> 1:11:24.180]  with watershed moments either politically uh in relation to iraq afghanistan or the u.s
[1:11:24.180 --> 1:11:31.220]  presidential election or watershed moments in the progression of the 9 11 truth movement
[1:11:32.340 --> 1:11:41.300]  now on on the latter the in uh may 2006 there was a major zogby poll that got released that said
[1:11:41.300 --> 1:11:51.380]  over half of americans think that 9 11 is a cover up days after that poll came out and 9 11 truth
[1:11:51.380 --> 1:11:58.580]  was pushed to the forefront of national media attention um a bin laden tape was released
[1:11:58.580 --> 1:12:05.540]  and in that tape he he reinforced the myth that he had carried out 9 11 despite the fact that in the
[1:12:05.540 --> 1:12:15.780]  first four video and audio tapes after 9 11 obon um osama bin laden sorry repeatedly said that he
[1:12:15.780 --> 1:12:23.140]  had nothing to do with 9 11 and it was only after december 2001 which is coincidentally when
[1:12:23.780 --> 1:12:29.940]  the foremost bin laden experts in the u.s reckon that he actually died it was only after that time
[1:12:29.940 --> 1:12:38.340]  that the uh infamous fat bin laden tape came out where he supposedly uh took the blame for 9 11
[1:12:38.340 --> 1:12:43.060]  and then in the subsequent video and audio tapes after that he took the blame as well
[1:12:44.580 --> 1:12:51.060]  so obviously now you have charlie sheen last week coming out and pushing 9 11 truth back to the
[1:12:51.060 --> 1:12:58.420]  forefront of uh national public attention and lo and behold a new bin laden tape gets released
[1:12:58.420 --> 1:13:06.420]  so from that perspective it does have ties to uh progression within the 9 11 truth movement
[1:13:06.420 --> 1:13:12.900]  is normally followed by the establishment attempting to reinforce the official story
[1:13:12.900 --> 1:13:19.300]  by having bin laden or alzo ahiri come out and uh reinforce the official story that i'll
[1:13:19.300 --> 1:13:26.980]  care to carry it out the attack but even more strongly is the historical track record of these
[1:13:26.980 --> 1:13:34.740]  videotapes coming out immediately around the time that either the bush or now the obama
[1:13:34.740 --> 1:13:43.540]  administration need some cover need some support for their failing agenda both in iraq and afghanistan
[1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:51.620]  now the most probably the most infamous example was right before the invasion of iraq when
[1:13:51.620 --> 1:13:58.020]  colin powell's making his infamous presentation to the un powell referenced the fact that an
[1:13:58.020 --> 1:14:03.780]  audio tape would soon be released in which uh bin laden claimed he was allied with saddam
[1:14:03.780 --> 1:14:10.180]  hussain and that this tape would be broadcast shortly afterwards now to anyone who has even a
[1:14:10.180 --> 1:14:17.940]  basic knowledge of geopolitics or religion regarding bin laden and saddam hussain will know that those
[1:14:17.940 --> 1:14:24.180]  two are sworn enemies they always were and to have an alliance would be like you know arm and
[1:14:24.180 --> 1:14:29.140]  dinners had a bush having alliance it would be completely out of the question but powell
[1:14:29.140 --> 1:14:35.780]  powell forecast that they would be released that proved a bin laden link to iraq and lo and behold
[1:14:35.780 --> 1:14:43.140]  it was and that was a key it was um a key piece of evidence that bush cited as a reason to invade iraq
[1:14:43.140 --> 1:14:51.700]  um most of your readers will remember right before the 2004 election the october surprise
[1:14:52.260 --> 1:14:58.340]  bin laden appeared right on cue when kerry was leading bush by a few percentage point to look
[1:14:58.340 --> 1:15:04.740]  like he was going to edge of the election um bin laden appeared to attack bush on october 29th
[1:15:04.740 --> 1:15:12.340]  and a few days later bush won the election and later both bush and kerry attributed bush's victory
[1:15:12.340 --> 1:15:18.900]  to the appearance of that bin laden tape in late october of 2004 and even walter cronkite the
[1:15:18.900 --> 1:15:24.660]  veteran news reporter said it it's thank to high heaven and it looked like a car row orchestrated
[1:15:24.660 --> 1:15:33.860]  setup so then you've got other examples where the tapes emerge along the most politically
[1:15:33.860 --> 1:15:40.740]  opportune moments for the government on two separate occasions for two years running um
[1:15:40.740 --> 1:15:50.180]  i man alzawa herey the uh number two to bin laden so-called deputy leader of al qaeda came out on
[1:15:50.180 --> 1:15:57.780]  the eve of the state of the union speech in january 2006 and then again in january 2007
[1:15:58.580 --> 1:16:04.820]  and in 2007 the big debate was about the iraq surge when bush wanted to send
[1:16:04.820 --> 1:16:11.220]  100 000 more troops into iraq and it was getting a lot of opposition right before the state of the
[1:16:11.220 --> 1:16:18.660]  union alzawa herey came out and attacked the proposal saying it would never work and that gave
[1:16:18.660 --> 1:16:25.060]  bush it greased the skid for him to run through the proposal and in fact in that state of the
[1:16:25.060 --> 1:16:34.420]  union speech in 2007 bush cited alzawa herey's videotape speech as a reason that people should
[1:16:34.420 --> 1:16:42.340]  support the surge policy in iraq so now we fast forward to today with this release of the bin
[1:16:42.340 --> 1:16:49.940]  laden the proposal bin laden tape yesterday and it arrives on the back of the deadliest month ever
[1:16:49.940 --> 1:16:58.420]  for us forces in afghanistan since the invasion 46 dead 46 us troops dead in august and september
[1:16:58.420 --> 1:17:05.380]  is going to rival that which is the highest monthly toll of the entire conflict it also arrives on
[1:17:05.380 --> 1:17:12.740]  the back of a cnn public opinion poll as well as others that show that quote opposition to the war
[1:17:12.740 --> 1:17:21.780]  in afghanistan is at an all-time high and this is also following up the obviously rigged election
[1:17:21.780 --> 1:17:29.860]  where the u.s puppet kamid karzai the former unicol executive has been returned to power
[1:17:29.860 --> 1:17:37.540]  on the back of his support of setting up fake polling stations and creating fake ballots
[1:17:37.540 --> 1:17:44.180]  that returned him to power so you've got this massive opposition to what's happening in afghanistan
[1:17:44.180 --> 1:17:51.540]  as obama plans to extend that war as well as the war in pakistan you have top generals
[1:17:51.540 --> 1:17:58.740]  in the uk and the u.s criticizing the policy in afghanistan and lo and behold
[1:17:59.300 --> 1:18:07.300]  a song bin laden pops up again out of nowhere on this audio tape and says that barack obama
[1:18:07.300 --> 1:18:14.740]  is quote powerless to halt the wars in afghanistan and iraq which as i wrote in the article seems
[1:18:14.740 --> 1:18:21.460]  a pretty odd statement to make in in light of the fact that obama has only extended an aggressive
[1:18:21.460 --> 1:18:30.580] ly beefed the campaigns in afghanistan and iraq the withdrawal in iraq was um a mirage he moved
[1:18:30.580 --> 1:18:35.380]  some troops out of the inner cities and just moved them out to the edges of the city than other
[1:18:35.380 --> 1:18:42.340]  you've talked about alex 50 000 contractors were sent back in again okay absolutely and we're talking
[1:18:42.340 --> 1:18:49.300]  to paul watson about his article cia linked intel center releases highly suspicious bin laden tape
[1:18:49.300 --> 1:18:53.860]  we now have more of these fake new york raids where they admit oh these are preemptive we
[1:18:53.860 --> 1:18:58.980]  had no evidence turned out shaney did those earlier and wanted to charge the guys under
[1:18:58.980 --> 1:19:04.740]  military courts they were u.s citizens to set the precedent to use the military against the
[1:19:04.740 --> 1:19:11.620]  general public under bush and now under obama they've issued dhs reports listing that homeland
[1:19:11.620 --> 1:19:18.260]  security is for conservatives gun owners libertarians ron paul supporters anti-fetal reserve people
[1:19:18.260 --> 1:19:24.340]  so this whole police state is for us not for al qaeda even if you believe al qaeda admittedly
[1:19:24.340 --> 1:19:31.540]  cia created a tactics on 9 11 you can clearly see that the whole homeland security apparatus
[1:19:31.540 --> 1:19:39.540]  is being used against we the people so we'll talk to paul watson more about that in a final
[1:19:39.540 --> 1:19:47.540]  segment with him on the other side of this quick break and then we got charlie sheen coming up

[1:24:23.780 --> 1:24:34.420]  of this break paul finishing up with the latest fake bin laden tape all these fake raids clearly
[1:24:34.420 --> 1:24:41.780]  they were building up to bolster the official 9-11 story before charlie went public now they're
[1:24:41.780 --> 1:24:48.340]  accelerating it they make national tv programs countering us attacking us you know they clearly
[1:24:48.340 --> 1:24:54.420]  are worried about what we're doing that shows that we're affecting change and that we have a
[1:24:54.420 --> 1:24:59.860]  chance to stop these people or they wouldn't be spending so much time and energy going after us
[1:24:59.860 --> 1:25:06.740]  well the the war in afghanistan and iraq fundamentally rely on the official 9-11 story being true
[1:25:06.740 --> 1:25:12.340]  like webster toplay says if that can be denigrated and discredited then it completely undermines
[1:25:12.340 --> 1:25:19.700]  the foundation of their wars what's interesting about almost every bin laden tape is the fact that
[1:25:19.700 --> 1:25:27.700]  whoever has scripted it and all the experts say that bin laden died in late 2001 everything
[1:25:27.700 --> 1:25:34.900]  since then has been scripted whoever's scripted it betrays an intricate knowledge of u.s political
[1:25:34.900 --> 1:25:41.060]  talking points that only somebody who closely followed it would know remember back in 2000
[1:25:41.060 --> 1:25:48.100]  the i think it was a london independent reporter went out and met bin laden and was flabbergasted
[1:25:48.100 --> 1:25:54.420]  about how bin laden was completely cut off from society and that he didn't know anything about
[1:25:54.420 --> 1:26:00.980]  he didn't know anything about even major news that was breaking at the time and he he accepted
[1:26:00.980 --> 1:26:06.740]  newspapers from the reporter like it was gold or something because he was he was so keen to catch
[1:26:06.740 --> 1:26:12.180]  up on the news because he was completely cut off from it these tapes betray a knowledge a deep
[1:26:12.180 --> 1:26:20.180]  knowledge of political talking points which is why the rhetoric contained in them is similar to
[1:26:20.180 --> 1:26:26.740]  the same rhetoric that we put out and the opponents of obama put out they're ascribing
[1:26:26.740 --> 1:26:34.740]  our criticism of obama to a storm of bin laden the means of discrediting it in the in the overall
[1:26:34.740 --> 1:26:41.380]  picture absolutely good propaganda has to sound reasonable too or the public is not going to
[1:26:41.380 --> 1:26:47.860]  buy into the bait it has to sound like it's a real critique so these are legitimate critiques
[1:26:47.860 --> 1:26:54.100]  but it's coming from al ciaida bin laden and so now it's discredited on another subject
[1:26:55.540 --> 1:27:01.860]  glenn beck clearly came out and said we had to have the banker bail out and it was good
[1:27:01.860 --> 1:27:08.580]  he supported the patriot act he said ron paul was a dangerous piece of crap as soon as ron paul lost
[1:27:08.580 --> 1:27:16.980]  the election suddenly he was his best friend glenn beck has clearly been positioned to manage and
[1:27:16.980 --> 1:27:23.380]  be loyal opposition for the establishment controlling the libertarian slash conservative
[1:27:23.940 --> 1:27:29.780]  backlash to obama and i get all these mean emails and calls i can't believe how ignorant
[1:27:29.780 --> 1:27:34.420]  in fact i was reading some of the comments on prison planet dot com on my open letter to beck
[1:27:34.420 --> 1:27:38.340]  that just went up a few minutes ago that we're asking folks to put out and they were saying oh
[1:27:38.340 --> 1:27:44.340]  alex must work for acorn yeah we've been attacking acorn day one making a film about acorn
[1:27:44.340 --> 1:27:50.180]  exposing acorn selling books exposing them having tarpley on and you've got these fake
[1:27:50.180 --> 1:27:56.900]  mainline conservatives see we're already back to left right now i'm a commie now i'm for obama
[1:27:57.460 --> 1:28:03.380]  because i am pointing out that beck is loyal opposition can't these guys understand that
[1:28:03.380 --> 1:28:10.820]  both parties and both movements are controlled well it doesn't look like they can understand that
[1:28:10.820 --> 1:28:15.780]  because they can't they don't have the attention span to watch a three-minute twenty-second youtube
[1:28:15.780 --> 1:28:24.020]  video where beck when he was on cnn is saying that he supports the bailout and then later when
[1:28:24.020 --> 1:28:30.660]  he's on fox news you know every day he's attacking the bailout just because when he supported it
[1:28:30.660 --> 1:28:35.780]  bush was in office and now obama's in office now he's counting on people not having long
[1:28:35.780 --> 1:28:43.140]  attention spans and i'm going after beck in a nice way to try to just point out to his followers
[1:28:43.940 --> 1:28:48.900]  that he will betray them so that they'll notice while he's doing it i mean he does it right out
[1:28:48.900 --> 1:28:54.340]  in the open this is painful paul i mean i'm committed to defeating the globalist takedown of the
[1:28:54.340 --> 1:29:03.700]  western world and i just wish beck wasn't a trader well how how can he be quote a libertarian at
[1:29:03.700 --> 1:29:11.220]  heart when he vehemently supported the usa patriot patriot act and he supported the wars of aggression
[1:29:11.220 --> 1:29:18.260]  lost launched under bush and continued by obama those political opinions are not subscribed to by
[1:29:18.260 --> 1:29:24.180]  the vast vast majority of libertarian so he's leading people are straight and anyone that
[1:29:24.740 --> 1:29:31.700]  can watch that gq video where he stages the crying on demand and doesn't think he's a phony after that
[1:29:31.700 --> 1:29:35.940]  just completely deluded stay there let's do five more minutes on back then i'm going to the phone

[1:33:32.980 --> 1:33:39.220]  obama responds to that but charlie sheen says i want to meet with you with 9-11 first responders and
[1:33:40.820 --> 1:33:46.260]  families of victims of 9-11 and the white house says we're going to take a pass on that meeting
[1:33:46.260 --> 1:33:50.420]  with you they did respond to sheen they'll be talking about that coming up next hour
[1:33:51.700 --> 1:33:58.580]  i mean just talk about incredible pettiness well that's right i mean this was a report
[1:33:58.580 --> 1:34:06.100]  this morning that an abc news report was talking to obama and he had it you know the white house
[1:34:06.100 --> 1:34:12.740]  claims he's too busy to even acknowledge sheen's letter never mind meet with sheen but obviously
[1:34:12.740 --> 1:34:20.260]  he's not too busy to talk about some uh mindless antics of this hip hop star jumping on stage at
[1:34:20.260 --> 1:34:27.620]  an mtv music awards show he uh spoke her length about that and yet he can't even acknowledge
[1:34:27.620 --> 1:34:34.100]  questions that are shared by the 9-11 victims family members um that are you know put out in
[1:34:34.100 --> 1:34:39.860]  this letter by charlie sheen so again it's total hypocrisy in fact obama routinely makes mindless
[1:34:39.860 --> 1:34:44.260]  comments about everything under the sun yeah he can't even acknowledge what sheen's done
[1:34:46.340 --> 1:34:52.500]  well the silence really illustrates how they're afraid of the facts they just got to have their
[1:34:52.500 --> 1:34:56.340]  fox news and abc news pundits and john mccain's daughter
[1:34:58.900 --> 1:35:05.780]  come out and name call and remember john mccain in popular mechanics in that totally debunked joke of a
[1:35:05.780 --> 1:35:15.780]  a research book wrote the forward attacking me by name i mean they attack me in the first page
[1:35:15.780 --> 1:35:22.580]  of the book i have the senator john mccain attacking me that shows they're concerned about
[1:35:22.580 --> 1:35:28.020]  what we're doing and they will not debate charlie sheen they can't debate charlie sheen
[1:35:28.020 --> 1:35:34.820]  because six of the ten commission members agree with charlie sheen well they're scared to death of
[1:35:34.820 --> 1:35:40.180]  the power of the 20 questions that are outlined in his letter and that's proven by the fact that
[1:35:40.820 --> 1:35:45.460]  hundreds of these hit pieces which came out mainly the ones over the last few days
[1:35:46.340 --> 1:35:52.500]  completely invent things that sheen was supposed to have said they put words in his mouth so they
[1:35:52.500 --> 1:35:58.900]  can politicize polarize and make the issue part of them they claim that sheen said bush planned
[1:35:58.900 --> 1:36:05.700]  to 9 11 and as everyone knows you know bush couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag there's no way
[1:36:05.700 --> 1:36:12.420]  you plan to 9 11 sheen isn't even saying that and they know that by ascribing those words to him
[1:36:12.420 --> 1:36:17.860]  they're just going to turn everybody off to it so they can spin it as just another you know deluded
[1:36:17.860 --> 1:36:23.220]  hollywood it would turn everybody off but people know the media lie so they're just digging a
[1:36:23.220 --> 1:36:32.500]  deeper hole for themselves right and i mean oh riley hannity mccain's daughter none of them even
[1:36:32.500 --> 1:36:39.300]  responded to cheat sheen's challenge to debate them on larry king live they haven't even responded
[1:36:39.300 --> 1:36:45.540]  to it so that just shows that they're afraid of the power of those 20 questions that are outlined
[1:36:45.540 --> 1:36:54.260]  in sheen's letter backed up by that bibliography absolutely paul okay in closing glenn beck
[1:36:54.260 --> 1:37:01.380]  do you agree with me and i want your honest response to this i don't spend my time bashing
[1:37:01.380 --> 1:37:06.980]  limbaugh i don't spend my time bashing people i disagree with who i think are phony conservatives
[1:37:08.260 --> 1:37:12.500]  i tried to explain that bush was just a puppet and that they would bring in a left-wing savior
[1:37:12.500 --> 1:37:20.980]  and then he would sell everybody out but glenn beck is particularly disingenuous limbaugh did not
[1:37:20.980 --> 1:37:30.660]  support the banker takeover bill the banker bailout michael savage shon hannity didn't support that
[1:37:31.700 --> 1:37:36.100]  beck made more trips than any other talk show host to meet privately with bush that's on record he
[1:37:36.100 --> 1:37:43.060]  brags about it beck when when ron paul had a chance to win he came out and really killed the campaign
[1:37:43.060 --> 1:37:48.500]  and said this guy's dangerous his people talk about bombs he twisted the thing about money bombs
[1:37:49.220 --> 1:37:54.980]  he's still bad mouths him on radio he's very two-faced is what i don't like about beck and now
[1:37:55.620 --> 1:38:01.220]  they have put him as the leader of the resistance to obama controlled opposition so in three to four
[1:38:01.220 --> 1:38:09.620]  years when they put a republican in there won't be real revolution and so beck can steer everybody
[1:38:10.580 --> 1:38:16.420]  he just really is a key person for the new world order because if we could have a real
[1:38:16.420 --> 1:38:22.740]  peaceful revolution of ideas a real move to audit the fed to end the fed which beck by the way isn't
[1:38:22.740 --> 1:38:27.220]  calling for that i've seen he supports the fellow reserve and says they're great
[1:38:27.220 --> 1:38:35.460]  great and then bad mouths him at the same time i mean can't people see beck is there to co-opt and
[1:38:35.460 --> 1:38:50.340]  control things paul we lost paul's connection in england uh that happens sometime let's let's
[1:38:50.340 --> 1:38:58.740]  get him back on because i want to get paul watson's take we couldn't even contact england on our studio
[1:38:58.740 --> 1:39:05.220]  lines in texas today so we use the genesis lines in minnesota maybe some phone things going on between
[1:39:06.020 --> 1:39:13.300]  the united states and the uk over in the middle of the atlantic ocean across the pond there but
[1:39:13.300 --> 1:39:21.860]  that's why i'm trying to be friendly about this and i have no illusions i know beck's
[1:39:21.860 --> 1:39:26.900]  an operative i know he's not going to listen but at least i'm going to be on record now
[1:39:26.900 --> 1:39:31.620]  pointing out he was for the banker bailout in the patriot act and demonize ron paul supporters and
[1:39:31.620 --> 1:39:38.260]  said use the u.s army on us and yesterday i was watching him we had fox news on in the break room
[1:39:38.260 --> 1:39:46.900]  and glenn beck was saying our republic is falling it's on its last leg save it this is all of our
[1:39:46.900 --> 1:39:54.500]  terminology and many people pointed out beck has changed much of what he says to mimicking what we
[1:39:54.500 --> 1:40:03.460]  do here which would be flattering if it wasn't so creepy uh all i want is freedom and the republic
[1:40:03.460 --> 1:40:09.460]  saved and i'm telling you glenn beck is a trojan horse glenn beck is a benedict arnold paul watson
[1:40:10.260 --> 1:40:15.060]  do you agree with me about glenn beck and about having to stand up against him and point out that
[1:40:15.060 --> 1:40:23.060]  this guy is completely two-faced well beck is there to suck at the grassroots conservative in and
[1:40:23.060 --> 1:40:31.460]  make them believe that they can fix everything by voting in a republic and in 2012 i mean beck is
[1:40:31.460 --> 1:40:38.020]  i mean beck is the equivalent of what people like olbermann and all those msnbc anchors were
[1:40:38.020 --> 1:40:44.180]  before obama got in you know they put it out that we could get the change we deserved by voting in
[1:40:44.180 --> 1:40:50.180]  obama everybody went out and did that and look what we've got we've got the exact same policies
[1:40:50.180 --> 1:40:55.620]  and in fact an aggressive expansion of those policies both with the wars and the financial
[1:40:55.620 --> 1:41:02.660]  bailout so it's about making people bail in the fact that the only way to change the system is to
[1:41:02.660 --> 1:41:11.220]  reject the two-party monopoly but beck is hooked into that i mean for years before he even was on
[1:41:11.220 --> 1:41:16.660]  television we would talk about beck and post articles on the website about how he was a virulent
[1:41:16.660 --> 1:41:24.580]  neocon and he always has been and now he poses as this libertarian when he's every political stance
[1:41:24.580 --> 1:41:30.420]  is the exact opposite of what a true libertarian would embrace well paul i know him so well
[1:41:31.380 --> 1:41:37.780]  i was able to successfully predict how he would debunk fema camps when there's bills introduced
[1:41:37.780 --> 1:41:43.700]  to set them up they're already set up houston chronicle new york times civilian inmate labor camp
[1:41:43.700 --> 1:41:49.460]  we emailed it we mailed it to him and i knew what he was going to do i mean this guy
[1:41:49.460 --> 1:41:59.860]  this guy is so evil i mean he's so obviously a fake and a two-face i mean again limbaugh wouldn't
[1:41:59.860 --> 1:42:07.940]  even support the banker bailout he's far worse than limbaugh well that's the kind of lining him up
[1:42:07.940 --> 1:42:13.620]  as you said as a new limbaugh aren't they but i mean there's already signs that he's falling from
[1:42:13.620 --> 1:42:21.060]  grace i mean apparently he lost half of his advertisers in the past couple of months so
[1:42:21.940 --> 1:42:26.100]  i mean maybe people are starting to wake up from him but obviously some of that's come from
[1:42:26.100 --> 1:42:30.340]  the fake left wing assault on him which is just about crushing freedom of speech
[1:42:31.380 --> 1:42:35.460]  so it's kind of a pin for movement that we're caught in we have to defend him
[1:42:35.460 --> 1:42:40.980]  when he's under attack um by people who just hate him because he has different political
[1:42:40.980 --> 1:42:47.140]  opinions well again he's meant to polarize he's meant to make it a republican democrat fox news
[1:42:47.140 --> 1:42:55.140]  msnbc bipolar system so that people really get invested in supporting republicans and then they're
[1:42:55.140 --> 1:43:01.540]  going to have the victory in 2010 and the victory in 2012 and then all the fema camps are built the
[1:43:01.540 --> 1:43:07.860]  police state's bill the republican that comes in will just expand it all and then we'll be called
[1:43:07.860 --> 1:43:13.620]  communist al-qaeda again because we're not supporting the right wing version of the new world order
[1:43:13.620 --> 1:43:19.140]  instead of being called right wing fascists by the controlled left it's so elementary and it
[1:43:19.140 --> 1:43:24.580]  just fools the public and that's why the public's losing their standard of living that's why foreign
[1:43:24.580 --> 1:43:29.940]  banks are raping you in a big way for tens of trillions of dollars in the last few months
[1:43:30.900 --> 1:43:35.700]  and paul i mean the good news is though a larger and larger portion of people
[1:43:35.700 --> 1:43:39.780]  are getting it both parties are controlled are understanding the bait and switch
[1:43:40.660 --> 1:43:45.300]  and i don't think this is going to work much longer i mean they pulled a rabbit out of their
[1:43:45.300 --> 1:43:52.500]  hat with obama and the same people that run obama wall street are the same ones that run back
[1:43:52.500 --> 1:44:00.500]  beckon obama are really twins in this thespian theatrical shakesperian event and there's not
[1:44:00.500 --> 1:44:06.980]  many more rabbits they can pull out of a hat time is running out people aren't sophisticated enough
[1:44:06.980 --> 1:44:14.180]  to know exactly what's happening but they know they're being lied to well the fact is that trusting
[1:44:14.180 --> 1:44:22.740]  government and corporate media is at an all-time low i mean the figures are that 29 trust the
[1:44:22.740 --> 1:44:28.260]  mainstream media which even that seems like a high number but the fallout from that is
[1:44:28.260 --> 1:44:34.900]  is the responses for authorities to claim that you know quote conspiracy thinking has infected
[1:44:34.900 --> 1:44:41.060]  all areas of society which produces things like the psychology today hit piece that we featured
[1:44:41.060 --> 1:44:46.980]  a couple of years ago it's not conspiracy thinking it's not some virus of mindless thinking
[1:44:46.980 --> 1:44:52.180]  that everything's a conspiracy that's infected society it's just the fallout from the fact that
[1:44:52.180 --> 1:44:58.500]  from the fact that government and media have lied to us so consistently and so brazenly for the past
[1:44:58.500 --> 1:45:05.620]  decade you know in our faith basically that people are going to lose trust in everything and that's
[1:45:05.620 --> 1:45:12.900]  why and that by the way is a problem it's good to question but the system has lied so much and
[1:45:12.900 --> 1:45:19.060]  been caught staging terror attacks and been caught engaged in every form of corruption and cps nationwide
[1:45:19.060 --> 1:45:24.580]  openly run almost in every case by pedophiles i mean they're openly admitting they're drugging
[1:45:24.580 --> 1:45:30.900]  our water and poisoning us in the white house science are his own textbook it's all so real
[1:45:31.940 --> 1:45:39.140]  that now the public doesn't trust anything even if it is bonafide the public steal lazy they won't
[1:45:39.140 --> 1:45:47.540]  go check stuff out so they just think everything's a lie i mean society paul is degenerating and
[1:45:47.540 --> 1:45:52.100]  collapsing i do want to tell the listeners right now and that's part of the new world
[1:45:52.100 --> 1:45:58.260]  order plan this learned helplessness where things get so bad that everybody just kind of gives up
[1:46:01.060 --> 1:46:07.780]  well yeah i mean there's two ways that that can fall the way that it's going at the moment is that
[1:46:08.660 --> 1:46:15.620]  people have no trust in any authority whatsoever so they're kind of just falling back on the
[1:46:15.620 --> 1:46:21.460]  celebrity mindlessness and the little obsessions that they have in their own personal lives and
[1:46:21.460 --> 1:46:26.660]  they're just focusing on what they can personally control and then trying to ignore what's going
[1:46:26.660 --> 1:46:31.940]  on in the world i mean that's what's happening at the moment from what i can see but i mean the
[1:46:31.940 --> 1:46:37.780]  other end of it is if people lose that much trust in any authority whatsoever then you're just going
[1:46:37.780 --> 1:46:43.620]  to get anarchy in the end and like you said that that may be what they want to reinforce the
[1:46:43.620 --> 1:46:50.660]  command and control position once people have lost all trust because if if things turn really bad and
[1:46:50.660 --> 1:46:57.460]  you have an economic collapse then uh from from anarchy they can seize control once again but
[1:46:57.460 --> 1:47:02.980]  at the moment it seems that people are either really clued into this and really know what's
[1:47:02.980 --> 1:47:10.020]  going on or they're just falling back on their own little personal obsessions and uh going that way
[1:47:10.020 --> 1:47:17.540]  so there's a real chasm as far as that comes in well you're absolutely right Paul Watson
[1:47:17.540 --> 1:47:23.620]  will continue to track all the great reports at prisonplanet.com reposted at infowars.com

[1:48:07.140 --> 1:48:12.580]  how how could you say you believe in any god at all to write something like that i mean that that
[1:48:12.580 --> 1:48:16.660]  was one of the most despicable things that i read a lot you know and that is one of the most
[1:48:17.940 --> 1:48:24.100]  in any human things i have ever read in my entire life now it was meant to be nasty it was meant
[1:48:24.100 --> 1:48:30.340]  to be hurtful oh i'll believe it was meant to say if it was meant to say if you don't submit to us
[1:48:30.340 --> 1:48:38.660]  uh we are going to destroy you but it doesn't work anymore go ahead and and what what really
[1:48:38.660 --> 1:48:42.740]  gets me is you know people who are uninformed about the Illuminati and people who don't have
[1:48:42.740 --> 1:48:46.820]  any sort of actual insight in the Illuminati you know they're hearing all this back and forth
[1:48:46.820 --> 1:48:51.220]  but they really don't know you know a lot of different things and even i saw this article
[1:48:51.220 --> 1:48:56.580]  yesterday they just blew my mind that you know they um they had the professor Langdon um from
[1:48:56.580 --> 1:49:01.540]  you know the DaVinci code movies uh they they were kind of saying you know what there is no
[1:49:01.540 --> 1:49:05.860]  actual professor Langdon's out there there's no one who really studies studies symbolism and
[1:49:05.860 --> 1:49:10.580]  you know that that's just a are you serious are you serious there's no one who studies
[1:49:10.580 --> 1:49:16.660]  studies symbolism let me tell you something about symbolism the triangle in the theme you tell me
[1:49:16.660 --> 1:49:22.740]  what a sphere and a triangle inside above the femalogo means the triangle is the biggest sign
[1:49:22.740 --> 1:49:29.860]  the Illuminati have are you serious look at that as an artist okay if you if fema came to you and
[1:49:29.860 --> 1:49:34.420]  said you know what we need a logo what's the purpose of a triangle in the middle of a sphere
[1:49:35.140 --> 1:49:41.220]  above above above this symbol it's saying fema protects the new world order the circle is a
[1:49:41.220 --> 1:49:47.780]  sphere of protection around the new world order command and control hierarchical system
[1:49:47.780 --> 1:49:54.260]  understand you have to understand that these people these people worship satan okay satan is
[1:49:54.260 --> 1:50:01.140]  their god they have to pretend you know to be to love cry that's why every politician is so
[1:50:01.140 --> 1:50:04.740]  and you know that you know they're they're christian they're going to church blah blah blah blah
[1:50:04.740 --> 1:50:08.580]  blah you know because they have to appear that way because if you said you know what i worship
[1:50:08.580 --> 1:50:12.660]  satan well you know that already history has already proven that there'll be enough people
[1:50:12.660 --> 1:50:18.900]  to come around and kill you you know that that's just that's just how it is but well the word occult
[1:50:18.900 --> 1:50:25.380]  means hidden and the elites operate through secret societies through intelligence agencies
[1:50:25.380 --> 1:50:31.540]  through shadow government they do their business in the dark and more than that the symbol the
[1:50:31.540 --> 1:50:37.140]  pyramid means the hierarchical government where those at the top have the knowledge those below
[1:50:37.140 --> 1:50:43.780]  don't and so through the mysteries through understanding how societies operate the priest class
[1:50:44.900 --> 1:50:51.140]  has total control over society the priest class are actually luciferians they have satanist and
[1:50:51.140 --> 1:50:56.740]  other sadistic people that serve them we'll be right back after this quick break please stay with us

[1:54:37.860 --> 1:54:47.380]  ted anerson up though just for a few minutes because gold is at $1,003 right now and the dollar has
[1:54:47.380 --> 1:54:52.900]  been going up and down the banks are now putting tens of trillions on the streets as they buy up
[1:54:52.900 --> 1:55:00.100]  assets it is just incredible to see this happening and now obama's announcing he wants the banking
[1:55:00.100 --> 1:55:06.740]  reform to give unlimited power to the federal reserve to take over every facet of our economy
[1:55:06.740 --> 1:55:11.860]  and to give that new authority that illegitimate authority you can't do that to this new offshore
[1:55:11.860 --> 1:55:18.180]  private consortium ladies and gentlemen the smart money is in gold and silver the smart
[1:55:18.180 --> 1:55:22.580]  money is getting out of the paper i told you get into gold five six years ago and it was 300
[1:55:22.580 --> 1:55:29.540]  bucks an ounce now it's above 3000 and all i know is it's one of the only smart investments
[1:55:29.540 --> 1:55:34.020]  where you can actually hold on to what you have i believe in physically holding metals
[1:55:34.020 --> 1:55:38.500]  physically holding silver and gold in your hands ted anerson tell us the latest developments
[1:55:38.500 --> 1:55:44.100]  well sure i'll just correct you on the spot price of gold right now and it's at 109 10 so it's oh
[1:55:44.100 --> 1:55:49.940]  excuse me it was 103 an hour ago 103 you're right about that and anyways yeah the the markets are
[1:55:49.940 --> 1:55:54.900]  going nuts right now i mean i obviously like we talked about yesterday the prices are going to
[1:55:54.900 --> 1:55:59.700]  be going up they did on the frank and the british sovereign there are just one or two things left
[1:55:59.700 --> 1:56:06.900]  that haven't increased yet one is that that walking liberty half at 869 the 10 dollar liberty right now
[1:56:06.900 --> 1:56:12.340]  is at 818 50 both of those are still at the same price they're going to go shooting up as well
[1:56:12.340 --> 1:56:17.220]  everything in this market is hot alex we're going to have a market like we had just a few years ago
[1:56:17.220 --> 1:56:23.620]  where the supply of gold is going to become so tight places like kitko are going to have to put
[1:56:23.620 --> 1:56:28.580]  disclaimers on the front of their website saying they can't deliver right now i mean barric had to
[1:56:28.580 --> 1:56:34.340]  default on their futures contracts because they sold too much gold so the gold and silver is running
[1:56:34.340 --> 1:56:40.820]  out but you're saying the deal from a month ago or three weeks ago where it's at 945 you're saying
[1:56:40.820 --> 1:56:46.180]  you're at the very end you've sold out of most of it what coins do you have left when the gold
[1:56:46.180 --> 1:56:53.140]  market was 55 or more dollars less well the coins that reflect those prices right now are going to
[1:56:53.140 --> 1:56:58.660]  be the 10 dollar liberty which is at 818 50 and the walking liberty half which is at eight dollars and
[1:56:58.660 --> 1:57:06.660]  69 cents that both of those coins right now are the same coins that i priced that i mean the same
[1:57:06.660 --> 1:57:12.500]  quote that i said three weeks ago when gold was down at that 945 level and we're just coming up
[1:57:12.500 --> 1:57:19.220]  off a 911 if there is definitely a strong market going on right now that stuff will go up in price
[1:57:19.220 --> 1:57:24.820]  too uh all i can say alex is that people should be taking heed right now plus also i was looking
[1:57:24.820 --> 1:57:29.940]  at stiglets right now his article from yesterday and he's talking about the the banks having a
[1:57:29.940 --> 1:57:35.140]  major problem much larger than it was a couple years ago and what paulson was trying to bail out
[1:57:35.140 --> 1:57:39.620]  the banks in fact ed we're going to break in one minute come back i'm going to give you the floor
[1:57:39.620 --> 1:57:44.180]  for five minutes i want to sit back because you've been doing this 30 years and you are an expert
[1:57:44.180 --> 1:57:50.420]  in your own right uh a caliber of Chapman i mean i mean you really got good insights on what stiglets
[1:57:50.420 --> 1:57:56.020]  is saying other economists saying we may have a dollar death like argentina forbes is saying that i
[1:57:56.020 --> 1:58:06.340]  hope that isn't the case but regardless 945 now 1009 that's 64 dollars more gold prices you're
[1:58:06.340 --> 1:58:12.020]  doing this at a deal nobody can do you've got silver at the price when it was a couple bucks less
[1:58:12.020 --> 1:58:25.940]  that's below spot almost gone 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 and i hope you'll call the brokers ted how
[1:58:25.940 --> 1:58:30.420]  long can you hold that deal i mean you you keep extending it yeah i know well the i couldn't
[1:58:30.420 --> 1:58:34.420]  extend the uh british sovereigns or the francs so right now we're going to hold this deal until
[1:58:34.420 --> 1:58:42.660]  midnight tonight oh so this is the only deal so you've run out of those okay explain it to me when we get back

[2:00:21.060 --> 2:00:30.660]  jones charlie sheen coming up in t-minus 30 minutes live with huge developments ted anderson i want
[2:00:30.660 --> 2:00:36.260]  you to sit back go over the financial numbers tell people the offer you've got the other golden
[2:00:36.260 --> 2:00:40.180]  silver at that lower prices run out you get a little bit left now of one offering so this

[2:00:45.060 --> 2:00:50.980]  and take calls you take us out to break tenor ted anderson you've got the floor i'd be happy
[2:00:50.980 --> 2:00:54.980]  to do it i mean probably the first thing that we should talk about is what happened over a
[2:00:54.980 --> 2:01:01.140]  barric gold if people understand what what they need to understand is that gold mines will sell
[2:01:01.140 --> 2:01:05.060]  the gold that they have in the ground they know that they can produce so much gold in a certain
[2:01:05.060 --> 2:01:10.740]  period of time so what they'll do is the lock in on the prices today and they'll sell it basically
[2:01:10.740 --> 2:01:15.460]  deliver the gold later because that's all the futures contract works and they expect to be
[2:01:15.460 --> 2:01:20.740]  able to pull the gold out of the ore from the ground in their mind uh farmers do this with
[2:01:20.740 --> 2:01:26.580]  corn and and beans uh they'll sell their crop even before they have picked their crop and harvested
[2:01:26.580 --> 2:01:33.300]  it through the futures market and then deliver the grain at the at at the fall and that satisfies
[2:01:33.300 --> 2:01:38.260]  the contract well american barric or barric gold they they changed their name barric gold when i
[2:01:38.260 --> 2:01:43.220]  was promoting them and i had a series seven it was american barric when barric gold decided to
[2:01:43.220 --> 2:01:47.540]  to default on its short contracts what that meant is that all this gold that they're
[2:01:47.540 --> 2:01:52.660]  going to be selling into the marketplace which equated to gold sold into the market and driving
[2:01:52.660 --> 2:01:57.700]  the price down was just taken off the marketplace which is probably a lot of the reason why we're
[2:01:57.700 --> 2:02:02.580]  seeing it jump up into the thousand dollar range right now but what stiglitz was talking about
[2:02:02.580 --> 2:02:07.940]  is to we're going to have a banking crisis that is much greater in ferocity than we had in the
[2:02:07.940 --> 2:02:15.220]  year 2007 when pae hank paulson and and uh and and president bush were uh trying to put together
[2:02:15.220 --> 2:02:20.740]  the seven seven hundred trillion dollar bailout plan for that thing that's hard money and and
[2:02:20.740 --> 2:02:26.740]  what's going on or what he's trying to recommend to uh president brock obama is that they break down
[2:02:26.740 --> 2:02:31.940]  the larger banks into smaller banks so when there is a crisis one of these things topple
[2:02:31.940 --> 2:02:35.540]  they're not too big to fail and they don't need to be bailed out quite so hard well
[2:02:35.540 --> 2:02:40.340]  the exact opposite is that is happening right now because when brock obama is talking about
[2:02:40.340 --> 2:02:45.780]  throwing more power to the federal reserve system that means that their bank branch or their member
[2:02:45.780 --> 2:02:49.700]  banks are going to be the ones that get bailed out and when they get bailed out they take that
[2:02:49.700 --> 2:02:55.620]  money and they use it to buy up toxic assets or banks that are failing they use our tax dollars
[2:02:55.620 --> 2:02:59.380]  to bail out these smaller companies and that's just going to create more havoc
[2:02:59.380 --> 2:03:04.820]  and more ruckus into the marketplace and it's not good for the u.s. dollar because the chinese
[2:03:04.820 --> 2:03:09.380]  right now are watching us do this in the printing press running full time and they're thinking about
[2:03:09.380 --> 2:03:14.580]  selling off their 3.3 trillion dollars with the u.s. government securities and obviously that's
[2:03:14.580 --> 2:03:19.140]  driving down the value of the dollar but at the same time it's driving up the price of gold
[2:03:19.140 --> 2:03:23.780]  there's another thing that they did at this time too they want to make sure that they have enough
[2:03:23.780 --> 2:03:28.020]  gold and reserves in their nation so they're allowing their own private citizens to buy
[2:03:28.020 --> 2:03:32.980]  gold at this particular time which is driving up the demand even further and that's why we're
[2:03:32.980 --> 2:03:37.860]  seeing gold rise at the same time where we have a credit implosion here in the united states and
[2:03:37.860 --> 2:03:43.220]  inflation actually has been held at bay just due to the fact that there's so much unemployment
[2:03:43.220 --> 2:03:48.500]  so really right at this particular time alex as i can see it we really need to be looking at
[2:03:48.500 --> 2:03:58.180]  precious metals and the 35 it was like 35 to 1 of the of the of the insider traders that are that
[2:03:58.180 --> 2:04:04.420]  are selling actually the stock market right now you know one one bullish 35 bearish these people
[2:04:04.420 --> 2:04:08.900]  know what are what's going on out there in the real world and even warren buffett himself is
[2:04:08.900 --> 2:04:14.660]  getting out of that market so you know i i just know where's the the stage is being set right now
[2:04:14.660 --> 2:04:19.540]  for a big plummet in the stock market i don't know exactly when and how far that's going to go
[2:04:19.540 --> 2:04:24.980]  but you know with the gold prices going up into the thousands all i can say is the timing right
[2:04:24.980 --> 2:04:29.620]  now to be getting into the gold is right and i do believe that it there will be time in the future
[2:04:29.620 --> 2:04:34.260]  when we're looking back at a thousand five a thousand seven a thousand nine and thinking that
[2:04:34.260 --> 2:04:39.380]  that is a really good buy so if you have the chance to do it if you look at your portfolio
[2:04:39.380 --> 2:04:49.300]  call us at 800-686-2237 again 800-686-2237 and take a serious look at what you're doing

[2:04:53.700 --> 2:04:58.980]  there's just no way that this thing is going to be turned around and and problems are solved again
[2:04:58.980 --> 2:05:05.380]  800-686 this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator

[2:08:07.620 --> 2:08:16.180]  man i was just talking to charlie sheen again during the break a lot of crazy stuff going
[2:08:16.180 --> 2:08:20.020]  on behind the scenes coming up at the bottom of the hour he's going to be on with us covering
[2:08:20.020 --> 2:08:27.140]  a host of big developments and issues so stay with us for that in fact queue up that piece of trash
[2:08:27.140 --> 2:08:38.820]  from uh fox news queue him up i mean talk about a slimy guy misrepresenting what charlie sheen
[2:08:38.820 --> 2:08:43.300]  said charlie is bringing up the commissioner members six of the ten saying the official
[2:08:43.300 --> 2:08:49.060]  story is a lie a fraud to cover up charlie's bringing up sybil edmunds the fbi translator
[2:08:49.860 --> 2:08:53.940]  coming out and saying bin laden and al-qaeda were working for the u.s. government up until the day
[2:08:53.940 --> 2:09:03.700]  9 11 she testified secretly to congress on that charlie's bringing up all these real issues and he
[2:09:03.700 --> 2:09:10.420]  is being demonized like i have never seen and then these cowards like john mccain's daughter
[2:09:11.220 --> 2:09:16.820]  she goes on the view and demonizes him and then charlie directly challenges her and we directly
[2:09:16.820 --> 2:09:22.660]  challenged her and emailed her and say fine you come out name the place and time live to debate
[2:09:22.660 --> 2:09:30.420]  charlie and they won't do it just absolutely amazing to see them do that type of stuff if you
[2:09:30.420 --> 2:09:37.460]  want that video it's actually on youtube but yeah uh here is that program greg gutfield
[2:09:39.860 --> 2:09:44.660]  and i will let you know old greg gutfield's really asking for the lawyers to take the gloves off i'll
[2:09:44.660 --> 2:09:51.220]  tell you that because this is libel and slander and if it's done with malice a forethought to cause
[2:09:51.220 --> 2:09:58.980]  harm to somebody you got a big problem totally distorting what charlie has had to say absolutely
[2:09:58.980 --> 2:10:06.260]  distorting the reality of it charlie makes tens of millions of dollars a year he has a lot to lose
[2:10:06.260 --> 2:10:11.460]  doing this he did this because he he can't let the continual lie of 9 11 just keep going on
[2:10:12.500 --> 2:10:16.020]  and you can't just call us names and and and demonize this and have it go away
[2:10:16.020 --> 2:10:23.540]  let's go ahead and play it here it is so charlie sheen has penned a fictitious conversation with
[2:10:23.540 --> 2:10:29.620]  president obama regarding the 9 11 attack see the star of scary movie three and scary movie four
[2:10:29.620 --> 2:10:34.340]  believes that bush cheney planned it all and feels obama should investigate it immediately
[2:10:34.340 --> 2:10:40.900]  in an effort to answer a quote bottomless warren of an answered questions bottomless now never
[2:10:40.900 --> 2:10:46.020]  mind how repulsive this is to anyone personally affected by the terror attack sheen is just awesome
[2:10:46.020 --> 2:10:53.540]  for revealing what makes up right there is so notice he misrepresent what sheen has said
[2:10:53.540 --> 2:10:59.620]  sheen saying i have questions this needs to be investigated then he says sheen is hurting the
[2:10:59.620 --> 2:11:06.100]  families and i that's the slander and and libel right there in the defamation this was also put
[2:11:06.100 --> 2:11:14.900]  out in text so it's libel implying that it's hurting the family saying charlie sheen is hurting
[2:11:14.900 --> 2:11:22.500]  families when the majority of the families are on record saying they believe 9 11's an inside job
[2:11:22.500 --> 2:11:31.620]  this guy misrepresents the families and says charlie is hurting them charlie is hurting
[2:11:31.620 --> 2:11:40.020]  the families and then he tries to imply like charlie sheen's this got this big head because he
[2:11:40.020 --> 2:11:43.700]  writes in the piece the president likes two and a half men charlie was writing that saying well
[2:11:43.700 --> 2:11:48.740]  let's write this like me and the president are being friendly and uh you know make the president
[2:11:48.740 --> 2:11:55.220]  look cool wasn't to make charlie look big but but here's the distortion bottomless now never
[2:11:55.220 --> 2:12:00.260]  mind how repulsive this is to anyone personally affected by the terror attack sheen is just awesome
[2:12:00.260 --> 2:12:07.220]  for revealing what makes it pause again here is how repulsive it is to anyone see this guy's
[2:12:07.220 --> 2:12:13.620]  representing everyone who was attacked doesn't like sheen and sheen's basically with the terrorists
[2:12:13.620 --> 2:12:18.900]  now this little slime ball thinks he's smart reading off that teleprompter what was written
[2:12:18.900 --> 2:12:25.380]  up for him by psyops like he's cute it's fun to manipulate his audience what a deceiver back to it
[2:12:25.380 --> 2:12:32.740]  first the egomania in this open letter he wrote he writes that the president admits liking two and
[2:12:32.740 --> 2:12:37.860]  a half men and here i thought martin was the crazy one in the family second there's the mental
[2:12:37.860 --> 2:12:42.260]  masturbation i apologize for using that word but when it comes to truth or obsession the
[2:12:42.260 --> 2:12:49.220]  questioning will always be as sheen says bottomless it pause it is bottomless when you look at all
[2:12:49.220 --> 2:12:55.300]  the evidence you called it conspiracy theorist that gulf of tonkin wasn't staged now declassified
[2:12:55.300 --> 2:13:01.620]  now declassified the cia was involved with kennedy and the in the head shooters gone public
[2:13:02.900 --> 2:13:08.500]  enrolling stone and on this radio show with the audio tape and video he houred hunt
[2:13:10.500 --> 2:13:14.820]  we now know chaney did lie about wmds we now know chaney wanted to bomb our own ships and
[2:13:14.820 --> 2:13:19.620]  blame it on foreign governments even the daily mail in england is saying they think this new
[2:13:19.620 --> 2:13:27.940]  al-qaeda tape bin laden tape is fake even conservative publications you he's just so
[2:13:27.940 --> 2:13:33.860]  sniveling and cowardly go back to him please it's an endless bag of doritos except instead
[2:13:33.860 --> 2:13:39.460]  of chips you get comebacks like oh that's what they want you to think and open your eyes dude
[2:13:39.460 --> 2:13:45.940]  it'd be funny if it wasn't so sad and my favorite the contradictions sheen claims that 9 11 was the
[2:13:45.940 --> 2:13:51.060]  pretext for systematic dismantling of our constitution he says this without realizing
[2:13:51.060 --> 2:13:56.740]  that since 9 11 not a single person has shut him up his relentless babble has done more to prove
[2:13:56.740 --> 2:14:01.860]  there's no cover-up than anything ever damn i wish the government would silence him or at least
[2:14:01.860 --> 2:14:07.940]  give him a better haircut suited for a middle-aged man it's strange i tell you but look i love sheen
[2:14:07.940 --> 2:14:13.780]  because he's a man unencumbered by self-awareness think about it the man's he's the world's most
[2:14:13.780 --> 2:14:20.180]  clueless druggy gambling addictive whore banger and he thinks he's uncovered a conspiracy and
[2:14:20.180 --> 2:14:25.300]  that we should all believe him how cute is that and if you disagree with me then you're probably a racist
[2:14:28.660 --> 2:14:33.300]  so he just threw everything including the kitchen sink at people
[2:14:36.500 --> 2:14:40.180]  they've introduced bills that have passed the house to ban free speech they've
[2:14:40.180 --> 2:14:44.660]  reintroduced the fairness doctrine they're trying to implement it the diversity chief on tape said
[2:14:44.660 --> 2:14:51.780]  he wants venezuelan type controls they've are on the verge of passing the cyber security act that
[2:14:51.780 --> 2:14:57.140]  in the new york times they admit will quote have a kindler gentler internet with government gatekeepers
[2:14:59.060 --> 2:15:04.500]  charlie sheen behind the scenes is under all sorts of heat to shut up you may hear about that soon
[2:15:04.500 --> 2:15:13.700]  here on the air mark cuban the new york times now admits had the white house email him and
[2:15:13.700 --> 2:15:19.220]  call him the securities and exchange commission and say if you don't shut up and not make that
[2:15:19.220 --> 2:15:24.420]  loose change final cut film we're going to indict you for something and a year later they did it
[2:15:24.420 --> 2:15:32.260]  cuban used the email and the phone call to defeat the phony case you understand this guy's making
[2:15:32.260 --> 2:15:37.220]  jokes about how our free speech isn't under attack when it publicly is
[2:15:42.100 --> 2:15:49.300]  absolutely incredible absolutely amazing let's go ahead and
[2:15:51.780 --> 2:15:57.860]  talk to steven in mexico city steven you're on the air welcome hey alex wow

[2:16:10.100 --> 2:16:15.620]  bullets of what's going on down here that affects you when concerns you um there's a
[2:16:15.620 --> 2:16:22.180]  commercial here for a local cable company that's uh going to do a showing of the dark night uh this
[2:16:22.180 --> 2:16:30.100]  week and it comes from Buenos Aires argentina and it's a sony channel and they show vignettes quick
[2:16:30.100 --> 2:16:39.700]  stills of the movie etc and uh one of the stills is obama joker really yeah really and i'm not i
[2:16:39.700 --> 2:16:45.300]  looked at it several times to make sure it definitely is it comes on for like a half a second but it's
[2:16:45.300 --> 2:16:53.060]  there um it's really bizarre well that obama joker is now extremely iconic well let me tell you
[2:16:53.060 --> 2:16:58.660]  down here it is especially you should know in the uh national university community will now
[2:16:59.860 --> 2:17:06.500]  um that is the center of the um of of of of the activity here
[2:17:06.500 --> 2:17:15.700]  here um with posters and uh they screen your films too so in mexico's city they're showing my
[2:17:15.700 --> 2:17:21.620]  documentaries oh yeah at the university and um it's free showing so nobody's making money on it
[2:17:21.620 --> 2:17:26.660]  that's good i'm glad no no i want i want a real cult following you know among the poli side kids
[2:17:26.660 --> 2:17:34.500]  you know politics kids and all of that uh another bullet um as far as um uh boy scouts somebody
[2:17:34.500 --> 2:17:41.780]  relate to me that uh they're asking kids very discreetly if they've seen firearms in the houses
[2:17:41.780 --> 2:17:47.700]  their parents you know i forgot that part that's going on here in the us as well they're asking
[2:17:47.700 --> 2:17:53.220]  boy scouts and girl scouts the schools the pediatricians ask and this father calls in and
[2:17:53.220 --> 2:17:58.020]  says what's wrong with homeland security working with the my girl scout he just doesn't understand
[2:17:58.900 --> 2:18:02.820]  no whatsoever it's acclimate it's history history read about the hitler youth he
[2:18:02.820 --> 2:18:07.220]  understood what's that what's happening there it's very clear so you're saying in mexico though
[2:18:07.220 --> 2:18:12.580]  they've got the the boy scouts and stuff spying on people absolutely and here you know things
[2:18:12.580 --> 2:18:18.660]  are a little bit softer here less of an edge and it's just a discreet question one kid told his dad
[2:18:18.660 --> 2:18:23.220]  and uh and that's it they yanked him out of there i mean people do know what that is people are very
[2:18:23.220 --> 2:18:27.540]  sensitive to that kind of stuff yeah i will say that in latin america where i've traveled quite a
[2:18:27.540 --> 2:18:34.740]  bit people know not to trust the government i mean americans are just so gullible and and and
[2:18:34.740 --> 2:18:39.380]  we used to be some of the most untrusting of government now we just we're starting to lose
[2:18:39.380 --> 2:18:45.620]  that trust thank god but at the same time i mean you know the government want anything from your
[2:18:45.620 --> 2:18:52.180]  kids is bad absolutely absolutely because it's a tool that's all it is but people are very on edge
[2:18:52.180 --> 2:18:57.860]  about that here another thing is charlie sheen he's very big down here and people are all behind him
[2:18:57.860 --> 2:19:04.420]  on this not only the expats like me but but everybody well because of his mexican ancestry you

[2:25:26.580 --> 2:25:32.980]  of mass destruction prevention and preparedness act of 2009 oh that's got some anti gun provisions
[2:25:32.980 --> 2:25:40.660]  in it yeah and it also enlists the postmaster to deliver medical countermeasure kits to
[2:25:41.220 --> 2:25:48.180]  and the american public i did i did see an article about that but i'd forgotten to cover it tell us
[2:25:48.180 --> 2:25:55.700]  more about it well it's it's pretty creepy um but also it signs us up the americans to pay for other
[2:25:55.700 --> 2:26:01.860]  country security measures for their weapons of mass destruction and threw out the bill it pretty
[2:26:01.860 --> 2:26:06.420]  much references that appropriations will be made as necessary so it's another blank check
[2:26:07.460 --> 2:26:15.060]  and um you know just like the energy bill we're going to be paying for other countries energy
[2:26:15.060 --> 2:26:20.660]  conservation measures as well we're signed up in the last 200 pages of that one no it's all about
[2:26:20.660 --> 2:26:26.420]  destroying the economy for vertical integration china india and others have to make no cuts we
[2:26:26.420 --> 2:26:33.380]  have to make cuts on carbon dioxide that isn't carbon it's a gas and is what plants breathe
[2:26:33.940 --> 2:26:38.100]  and they've got some of the public convinced that it's a deadly nerve gas that kills you
[2:26:38.100 --> 2:26:45.380]  they've now listed it as a toxic waste next they'll list dihydrogen monoxide or water you
[2:26:45.380 --> 2:26:50.260]  can go to the average person and say should we ban dihydrogen monoxide and they will say yes
[2:26:50.260 --> 2:26:56.820]  yes they don't know that dihydrogen monoxide is water the average person if you say let's
[2:26:56.820 --> 2:27:02.340]  ban sodium chloride they'll say ban it they'll sign a petition sodium chloride is table salt
[2:27:03.780 --> 2:27:09.220]  and there's no end to how much people love to be conned and raped
[2:27:13.060 --> 2:27:17.700]  you're right about that um i was just calling to bring it to your attention because i hadn't

[2:28:05.380 --> 2:28:11.380]  with 20 super powerful questions about 9 11 and is putting everything on the line
[2:28:11.380 --> 2:28:18.740]  when he knew the government already went after mark cuban the winehouse called him and said don't
[2:28:18.740 --> 2:28:24.980]  put that movie out or will indict you and then it came out later they did indict him we're dealing
[2:28:24.980 --> 2:28:32.340]  with serious criminals charlie sheen is just an amazing hero with cahones he's got to carry
[2:28:32.340 --> 2:28:40.020]  around in a wheelbarrow don't understand why he he would put this together or criticize look researchers
[2:28:40.020 --> 2:28:43.940]  are good at doing research but it takes someone who knows how to write a script to package all
[2:28:43.940 --> 2:28:48.260]  the research into something really marketable and that's what he's done he's done what he's
[2:28:48.260 --> 2:28:52.580]  an expert at doing and so for all the people who are concerned about that don't it's in the hands
[2:28:52.580 --> 2:29:00.180]  of an expert look that's co until pro we could we could uh you know give people a pot of gold

[2:29:22.340 --> 2:29:29.300]  but that's also who will be remembered in history and that's also the people that make society good

[2:33:27.860 --> 2:33:34.660]  president those 20 key bullet points 60 of the commission saying a cover up a lie a fraud there

[2:33:49.140 --> 2:33:55.780]  i voted for and the media spun it and said charlie sheen wants to hurt the families the
[2:33:55.780 --> 2:34:04.820]  families all hating with no evidence true defamation true slander true libel and so charlie last
[2:34:04.820 --> 2:34:12.260]  friday issued the challenge he said any of you people the daughter of mccain rush limbaugh
[2:34:12.260 --> 2:34:19.700]  shan hannity millo riley you come on a live tv show you debate me on the facts i'll bring the truth
[2:34:19.700 --> 2:34:24.260]  you bring popular mechanics whoever you want and these cowards are real tough with their
[2:34:24.260 --> 2:34:30.980]  teleprompters but they won't debate him but they have ratcheted up the attacks to the nastiest
[2:34:30.980 --> 2:34:35.060]  stuff i've ever seen there's a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes as well but that'll
[2:34:35.060 --> 2:34:41.060]  come out in the future charlie wants to bring it out regardless 911 truth back on the front burner
[2:34:41.060 --> 2:34:44.980]  the establishment wasn't just able to use it for their police state and their wars
[2:34:44.980 --> 2:34:49.940]  this eighth anniversary and now we're seeing all the new tapes coming out trying to counter us
[2:34:49.940 --> 2:34:53.220]  charlie sheen great to have you here with us great to be here alex how are you man
[2:34:53.860 --> 2:34:59.780]  good uh there's a lot there's a lot to talk about yes there is yes there is where where shall we
[2:34:59.780 --> 2:35:08.180]  start wherever you'd like uh well i think um i think we got to talk about this this this
[2:35:08.180 --> 2:35:14.980]  continuing uh mainstream media attack that is just so unfounded and and just baseless and
[2:35:14.980 --> 2:35:21.460]  then without merit and and is uh is so desperately trying to swing the focus into a different
[2:35:21.460 --> 2:35:28.100]  direction that is uh just mired and blatant fiction and total manipulation and it's just uh
[2:35:28.900 --> 2:35:34.980]  it's so transparent it it it's so predictable i mean if this is the best they got how could
[2:35:34.980 --> 2:35:40.420]  we rely on any of these clowns for anything legitimate about any aspect of the news or
[2:35:40.420 --> 2:35:49.060]  or or the world we live in period well that's why they're all losing market share is because
[2:35:49.060 --> 2:35:55.780]  people don't trust a damn thing they say and we've got polls of 83 on cnn supporting you
[2:35:55.780 --> 2:36:03.140]  84 question the official story uh in the new york times you're bad for reading the washington post
[2:36:03.140 --> 2:36:09.300]  quoting six of the ten commissioners saying it's a fraud but see they won't counter that they make
[2:36:09.300 --> 2:36:15.860]  up stuff you never said yeah they are uh they're they're they're really insistent on um on on
[2:36:15.860 --> 2:36:24.500]  on spinning all sorts of quotes theories beliefs and ideas and statements that i've put forth and
[2:36:24.500 --> 2:36:31.060]  it's uh it is such a blatant misrepresentation of of of what you and i have that have been
[2:36:31.060 --> 2:36:40.660]  um you know so uh so painstakingly uh focused on here and and and so careful about you know
[2:36:40.660 --> 2:36:45.540]  the the bullet points that we chose the way that we constructed the letter and and and the message
[2:36:45.540 --> 2:36:52.020]  that we're delivering that it's um it's just uh i i've got to believe at some point there could
[2:36:52.020 --> 2:36:57.860]  be some legal action here you know i'm not saying that's where i'm headed with this because i think
[2:36:57.860 --> 2:37:03.220]  we got bigger first fish to fry than that that these you know worthless douchebags but um
[2:37:03.860 --> 2:37:10.660]  it's just a shame that uh that they they've created the illusion that they that they command
[2:37:10.660 --> 2:37:16.580]  the truth that they hold all the cards that what they say is uh is law when in fact that it's uh
[2:37:17.220 --> 2:37:20.740]  it's quite the opposite you know when they they're making statements that there are the
[2:37:20.740 --> 2:37:25.380]  statements that i made about you know push and cheney were behind this thing it's an absolute
[2:37:25.380 --> 2:37:31.780]  cover-up it's you know they blew up the towers and i think that that the bin laden was in contact
[2:37:31.780 --> 2:37:38.100]  with the cia up until 9 11 and i think that this happened i think then it's like no no guys no
[2:37:38.100 --> 2:37:44.180]  read the letter be you know be responsible journalists read the freaking letter and let's
[2:37:44.180 --> 2:37:49.940]  talk about that instead they gotta drudge up all types of stuff you know real or imagined whatever
[2:37:49.940 --> 2:37:57.060]  you know let's let's for a second maybe you know peek into the into the closets of some of these
[2:37:57.060 --> 2:38:03.620]  knuckleheads and then see what skeletons lurk amongst their debris you know well that's the
[2:38:03.620 --> 2:38:10.820]  issue is that it on these shows they say charlie sheen says this yeah charlie sheen said that
[2:38:10.820 --> 2:38:16.180]  and they're making up fake quotes when you deliberately in your statements on this show
[2:38:16.180 --> 2:38:21.300]  and in the letter said i just want you to answer these questions six of the tens say
[2:38:21.300 --> 2:38:26.900]  there should be a new investigation and their answer is every family hates you charlie you're
[2:38:26.900 --> 2:38:35.620]  hurting the families they continue to use that that tired excuse as a as a shield as you as as
[2:38:35.620 --> 2:38:44.420]  you often put it you know and it's just uh it's it's so shameful and it's um it's it's just really
[2:38:44.420 --> 2:38:48.660]  it's just so unacceptable on so many fronts you know well charlie i just want to say
[2:38:49.380 --> 2:38:54.020]  that i really do admire you i'm not just here i'm not just here saying oh i admire charlie
[2:38:54.020 --> 2:38:58.980]  because you're a big hollywood tv star and you're on my show and i mean i really know you well over
[2:38:58.980 --> 2:39:04.820]  the years and i know what you go through behind the scenes to do this and like a true hero you
[2:39:04.820 --> 2:39:10.100]  never talk about it no uh you know all the stuff that was made up about you before you were told
[2:39:10.100 --> 2:39:15.140]  shut up we're going to make up a bunch of crap and they did uh you know in the nastiest way and
[2:39:15.140 --> 2:39:20.260]  going after cuban now in the new york times the white house calling him i mean this is heavy
[2:39:20.260 --> 2:39:26.260]  gangsters you're going up against and you've gone through all of this and you've come out smelling
[2:39:26.260 --> 2:39:31.220]  like a rose because the people know the media lies and spins and and what i want you to speak to
[2:39:31.220 --> 2:39:38.340]  next is you put out the challenge to john mc to john mccain's daughter and all these people
[2:39:38.340 --> 2:39:45.140]  and they're afraid to debate you i haven't heard anything back thus far and we issued the challenge
[2:39:45.140 --> 2:39:50.980]  when Alex last friday last friday yeah all right so we're given the weekend you know they were busy
[2:39:50.980 --> 2:39:58.100]  whatever um but uh yeah no we haven't uh my my my pr team has not received any calls uh
[2:39:58.980 --> 2:40:06.100]  you haven't received any calls i haven't received any calls and um just seems uh i think you know
[2:40:06.100 --> 2:40:12.580]  know very glaring in my opinion that uh whether they got to hide what are they so afraid of
[2:40:13.380 --> 2:40:19.380]  let me just read one thing from the letter alex that these uh you know he's talking heads he's
[2:40:19.380 --> 2:40:26.420]  talking pinheads need to uh need to be made aware of um please keep in mind mr president
[2:40:26.420 --> 2:40:32.420]  everything i'm about to say is documented as fact and part of the public record the information you
[2:40:32.420 --> 2:40:39.700]  are holding in your hands chronicles and verifies each and every point now would you and i have
[2:40:39.700 --> 2:40:45.860]  written a statement like that just prior to the briefing if we didn't feel it was absolutely
[2:40:45.860 --> 2:40:51.700]  bulletproof and stood completely on its own no we wouldn't have and now that is in the
[2:40:51.700 --> 2:40:56.980]  white house hands gibbs has it they called you back you've talked to them we have their emails
[2:40:56.980 --> 2:41:00.900]  we didn't publish their emails or phone calls back to you we publish your emails to them
[2:41:00.900 --> 2:41:05.620]  um you know out of respect to privacy even though it's a public office of the white house
[2:41:05.620 --> 2:41:12.340]  press secretary gibbs uh here you are saying i'd like to meet with you with the 9 11 families
[2:41:12.340 --> 2:41:19.860]  you're in contact with 9 11 families here you are saying i'd like to debate and on top of that
[2:41:19.860 --> 2:41:23.940]  larry king was hot to have you on but he said we've got to have somebody on the other side
[2:41:23.940 --> 2:41:32.020]  and then larry king called you up last week and i said look we can find no one to debate charlie
[2:41:32.020 --> 2:41:38.740]  sheen it's incredible which yeah which which which doesn't really support their whole argument
[2:41:38.740 --> 2:41:47.620]  because i'm a complete nut bag i'm crazy quote unquote um i have uh i have what did musdash call
[2:41:47.620 --> 2:41:55.860]  me musdash called me uh he said i had a trick gene yes do we even do we know what a trick

[2:42:04.100 --> 2:42:10.500]  get your science team on that right away um so if stromboli is going to attack me with a trick
[2:42:10.500 --> 2:42:17.620]  gene um shouldn't be he be held responsible for at least explaining what that means well that's or
[2:42:17.620 --> 2:42:24.580]  or are we giving him too much airtime with too much credit well you know herald o revere is a
[2:42:24.580 --> 2:42:31.140]  joke in his own right and all he did was use lies in windows say you were hurting the families the
[2:42:31.140 --> 2:42:38.420]  families all almost to a person the news says over 75 didn't like the commission and said it
[2:42:38.420 --> 2:42:42.900]  was a fraud and cover up here there's there's all those famous photos and videos of them
[2:42:42.900 --> 2:42:49.860]  holding up signs saying cover up right and they're up there knowing that's the case lying and claiming
[2:42:49.860 --> 2:42:55.700]  they represent the families and then saying you're hurting the families i'm when it was bush that
[2:42:55.700 --> 2:43:00.660]  blocked the families being able to sue saudi arabia for that connection that brings me to another
[2:43:00.660 --> 2:43:09.140]  point you made off air and that's about hollywood and their so-called anti-war stance yeah it just
[2:43:09.140 --> 2:43:16.340]  seemed a little a little hypocritical in my book at least um that they're there everybody is so
[2:43:16.340 --> 2:43:21.940]  outspoken against the war but they they seem like they're forgetting the reason that the war began
[2:43:21.940 --> 2:43:28.180]  seems like they're forgetting what uh what had to take place prior to both wars being launched
[2:43:28.180 --> 2:43:33.860]  and um so i don't feel um i'm not saying like i can't handle this out here on my own because i went
[2:43:33.860 --> 2:43:39.620]  into the fire and uh you know i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm ready to carry the flag i'm ready to deliver
[2:43:39.620 --> 2:43:43.940]  the message i'm ready to do whatever i have to do to keep the fight going to keep this you know to
[2:43:43.940 --> 2:43:49.060]  keep focus on the issue um but i just um yeah it might have been nice if somebody came forward and
[2:43:49.060 --> 2:43:53.700]  said i got your back bro i got your back but um you know i guess everybody's too worried about
[2:43:53.700 --> 2:43:58.340]  the things they're worried about and you know what that they're they're absolutely entitled to to
[2:43:58.340 --> 2:44:03.220]  take that that position um i'm not saying i respect it i'm not saying i disrespect it but um
[2:44:03.940 --> 2:44:10.660]  to say i wasn't slightly disappointed uh would be it would be a lie well sometimes it takes time
[2:44:10.660 --> 2:44:16.660]  i mean you saw jessie ventura willy nelson a lot of other people go public after you went public
[2:44:16.660 --> 2:44:22.100]  sure and and we don't know that hollywood people haven't made a statement to the media the media
[2:44:22.100 --> 2:44:28.580]  is trying to clamp this down charlie yeah yeah i guess you're right yeah so i think they're there
[2:44:28.580 --> 2:44:33.300]  there could have been those that that uh they came forward that just uh the message was not delivered
[2:44:33.300 --> 2:44:39.620]  you know well i happen to know for a fact that there are some other big hollywood people who
[2:44:39.620 --> 2:44:43.540]  have made little statements here and there but they haven't boldly come out on the radio they
[2:44:43.540 --> 2:44:48.740]  haven't made a public statement to the president and i think that's why you are a hero charlie
[2:44:48.740 --> 2:44:53.780]  well thanks alex i mean i don't look at myself like that honestly i don't i'm not sitting back
[2:44:53.780 --> 2:45:00.580]  here like you know did studying google and every single story i'm not you know basking in what
[2:45:00.580 --> 2:45:07.780]  i've done i just you know i feel like i have a responsibility um to to to you know use my
[2:45:07.780 --> 2:45:14.180]  platform use my position use my voice and and um represent those that that that don't have that
[2:45:14.180 --> 2:45:19.620]  platform that don't have the ability to to to reach the amount of people that i do and um
[2:45:20.660 --> 2:45:24.900]  you know last time i checked that was my god given right in this country as law abiding
[2:45:25.460 --> 2:45:31.140]  taxpaying american well that's another fact last time i checked but i guess you know i guess
[2:45:31.140 --> 2:45:36.660]  that the clock is ticking on that front as well but wait a minute i'll let's talk for two seconds
[2:45:36.660 --> 2:45:42.180]  about the the president finds the time to comment on this ridiculous county west
[2:45:42.180 --> 2:45:48.980]  thing in a music award show and then you know they they they have to call and apologize to the
[2:45:48.980 --> 2:45:53.940]  white house because it was something set off the record but it's like a whole big thing but he
[2:45:53.940 --> 2:46:00.820]  doesn't even acknowledge that uh that this letter was presented the video was produced and then
[2:46:00.820 --> 2:46:06.740]  launched on youtube that's blown up you know in the last four or five days he doesn't even have
[2:46:06.740 --> 2:46:14.740]  the decency the compassion that the the executive awareness to just make one comment about this
[2:46:14.740 --> 2:46:19.300]  just so we know that he's read it that he cares that he doesn't care something just let us know
[2:46:19.300 --> 2:46:25.220]  where you stand mr president because uh you know i didn't do this i didn't do this just to you know
[2:46:25.220 --> 2:46:31.460]  suddenly put myself back in the news you know in fact you're the media has reported one of the
[2:46:31.460 --> 2:46:36.580]  most private people in hollywood turned down interviews constantly uh was talking to your
[2:46:36.580 --> 2:46:41.700]  publicist larry king's trying to get you every week you've refused for year after year you suddenly
[2:46:41.700 --> 2:46:47.380]  say okay i'm ready to come on and talk about 9 11 and you can have three people against me and even
[2:46:47.380 --> 2:46:53.380]  three to one they can't get them to come on and go up against you just like popular mechanics will
[2:46:53.380 --> 2:47:00.100]  debate no one they will only go on when the opposition's hands are tied just like obama
[2:47:00.100 --> 2:47:06.260]  won't touch what you're doing because it has substance some fool grabbing a microphone away at
[2:47:06.260 --> 2:47:14.980]  some award ceremony that's safe for him to weigh in on and call the guy a jackass exactly
[2:47:16.020 --> 2:47:21.860]  i mean i don't drink but i don't see why he and i couldn't uh recreate the you know the rose garden
[2:47:21.860 --> 2:47:30.260]  to beer meeting you know well you could have a buckler like uh one of the guys that doesn't drink
[2:47:30.260 --> 2:47:38.900]  dead exactly um but again you know it i mean obviously at this point everybody knows we're
[2:47:38.900 --> 2:47:44.580]  not hide we're here to make a statement we're here to confront you know an issue and issues that
[2:47:44.580 --> 2:47:53.620]  have been ignored and and and and steamrolled it and completely devastated for for much too long
[2:47:53.620 --> 2:47:58.420]  and um and it's time to be accountable it's time to step up it's time to step forward it's time to
[2:47:58.420 --> 2:48:05.060]  you know put this thing back on the front burner and um and it's time to demand the truth you know
[2:48:05.940 --> 2:48:10.260]  that's what it's really about it's really about right here right now what can we do right here
[2:48:10.260 --> 2:48:15.220]  right now well you and i've talked a lot about why you wanted to go public and it's the same
[2:48:15.220 --> 2:48:20.420]  reason i go public how do you know six of the ten commissioners say it's a fraud to cover up
[2:48:20.420 --> 2:48:27.940]  how do you know the white house uh was involved covering it up how do you know that fbi translators
[2:48:27.940 --> 2:48:32.820]  said the government was running al qaeda and bin laden up until the day of the attack 9 11
[2:48:32.820 --> 2:48:38.740]  how do you know norad stood down and then just go oh i'm gonna go on about my life uh they've
[2:48:38.740 --> 2:48:44.180]  staged gulf of tonkin shaney wanted to blow up our own ships this whole history and then we're
[2:48:44.180 --> 2:48:50.420]  supposed to just sit back and ignore it and that's completely abnormal to be able just to ignore this
[2:48:50.420 --> 2:48:58.340]  it is it is but uh unfortunately that um you know they've created the illusion that that that that
[2:48:58.340 --> 2:49:03.060]  that's uh that there's no other option that is the only way to behave that is the only way to
[2:49:03.060 --> 2:49:08.740]  thank and anybody that dares to buy that is uh is labeled a nut job is able to you know is
[2:49:08.740 --> 2:49:15.460]  labeled a wacko and just um no i'm sorry that's not good enough that's not um that's not what what
[2:49:15.460 --> 2:49:20.820]  you know what what free thinking people were were how we were taught but not what you know that those
[2:49:20.820 --> 2:49:28.180]  aren't the ideals we were raised on charlie when we come back we've got a big announcement to make
[2:49:28.180 --> 2:49:34.820]  and we've got a few other issues to cover in the time we have with you uh today but just asking you
[2:49:34.820 --> 2:49:40.100]  live here on air from my perspective it's been a huge success with your video message 20 minutes
[2:49:40.100 --> 2:49:45.060]  of the president published by hundreds of newspapers links to it some papers printed the whole thing
[2:49:45.060 --> 2:49:51.540]  some your 20 your 20 bullet points uh it's reignited a huge debate about false flag terror
[2:49:51.540 --> 2:49:56.820]  and i think really keeps the establishment from trying to pull something like this again
[2:49:57.620 --> 2:50:03.460]  are you happy with what's happened overall i'm thrilled alex i'm thrilled i mean this is uh this
[2:50:03.460 --> 2:50:10.900]  is you know phase one is a major success but you know to be thrilled and and and not satisfied
[2:50:10.900 --> 2:50:16.500]  this um is it's a little frustrating to be honest you know because um i didn't i didn't start this
[2:50:16.500 --> 2:50:24.580]  i didn't i didn't you know roll this snowball downhill to uh to have it just be this you know
[2:50:24.580 --> 2:50:31.140]  i did this is the ultimate goal is to is to sit down with the man is to have get get 20 minutes

[2:54:28.980 --> 2:54:35.300]  the unanswered questions he looks at his family he decides to go public an intensely private person
[2:54:35.300 --> 2:54:42.420]  but he's doing it because he can't sleep at night unless he does a man after my own heart
[2:54:42.980 --> 2:54:49.540]  charlie's going to be with us 20 minutes into the next hour i just cleared the phones your chance
[2:54:49.540 --> 2:55:01.860]  to talk to him about 9 11 9 11 truth 1 800 25 9 92 31 1 800 25 9 92 31 your questions or comments
[2:55:01.860 --> 2:55:07.700]  for charlie sheen coming up when we start the next hour charlie i notice here in your letter
[2:55:08.740 --> 2:55:13.700]  your your open letter to the public you say another bin laden tape is surfaced this morning
[2:55:13.700 --> 2:55:20.100]  i will be monitoring the fbi's most wanted website to see if this tape finally provides the bureau
[2:55:20.100 --> 2:55:27.540]  with the evidence required to list him for the crime of 9 11 on his rap sheet thus far it has not
[2:55:27.540 --> 2:55:38.580]  yet yet um it's still not up it's still not up so it doesn't really make any sense to keep rolling
[2:55:38.580 --> 2:55:46.180]  out these tapes video audio whatever and um it doesn't seem to uh it doesn't seem to connect
[2:55:46.180 --> 2:55:51.940]  with anything um he keeps coming out in these fake videos that have been proven to be fake and now
[2:55:51.940 --> 2:55:59.460]  audios admitting he carried it out if they have him listed and indicted for the coal and the embassy
[2:55:59.460 --> 2:56:05.060]  bombings in africa why not for 9 11 because the fbi says they don't have the evidence yeah yeah no
[2:56:05.060 --> 2:56:11.460]  it um it it it really confuses the whole issue it confuses the whole issue i know there's a
[2:56:11.460 --> 2:56:18.500]  reason that that was the first bullet point on the list because i've been in conversation that i've
[2:56:18.500 --> 2:56:22.340]  told people i said you know if you visit the fbi's most wanted you look up the lobby and then
[2:56:22.340 --> 2:56:27.860]  that nine nine 11 is just not mentioned they're like oh that's not true and then you walk them
[2:56:27.860 --> 2:56:32.100]  over to a computer you're bringing up and they they sit there dumbfounded you know
[2:56:34.100 --> 2:56:39.540]  and you know i would like to believe that because of the letter you hopefully in in in
[2:56:39.540 --> 2:56:47.220]  certain situations that that's it led people to do just that it led them to go check well charlie
[2:56:47.220 --> 2:56:53.540]  there is no doubt and paul watson concurs and he talked about this last hour you had them
[2:56:53.540 --> 2:57:00.260]  doing 9 11 hit pieces against us right in the last few months you had you had potas starting
[2:57:00.260 --> 2:57:06.020]  to invoke 9 11 as the pretext to increase troops in iraq and afghanistan or contractors of course
[2:57:06.020 --> 2:57:11.940]  and then you have more warrantless raids of innocent people it came out cheney did that and
[2:57:11.940 --> 2:57:17.060]  wanted to use the army just to create fear that's been classified of course and you have this
[2:57:17.060 --> 2:57:22.260]  bin laden tape coming out from the intel center who's been caught uploading past ones with the
[2:57:22.260 --> 2:57:30.820]  intel center logo in the same video layer as the al-qaeda logo meaning they produced it
[2:57:34.100 --> 2:57:39.540]  yeah are we are we are we surprised are we shocked are we are we dumbfounded what uh
[2:57:40.340 --> 2:57:46.500]  i mean it's what these people do come on you know well how do you like having the pentagon release
[2:57:46.500 --> 2:57:52.580]  a new video trying to overshadow your going public well i mean i don't i don't want to take credit
[2:57:52.580 --> 2:57:57.300]  that that was that was their response i mean it seems like the timing is a little suspect a little
[2:57:57.300 --> 2:58:02.020]  convenient perhaps well they make national tv shows attacking us bro yeah that's true that's
[2:58:02.020 --> 2:58:09.620]  true yeah no they um i think that you know if if perhaps it wasn't a coincidence um then uh
[2:58:09.620 --> 2:58:16.660]  oh thank gosh it um you know i would have to say uh to quote my dad from apocalypse that we uh we
[2:58:16.660 --> 2:58:24.980]  really shoved a weed up command that you know oh man you are something else charlie sheen we're

[3:01:01.300 --> 3:01:07.380]  truth of the info and that is the vehicle of publicity the tool of publicity is extremely
[3:01:07.380 --> 3:01:12.500]  powerful and when you've lent your name to the facts of truth charlie you have supercharged the
[3:01:12.500 --> 3:01:17.380]  publicity which has always been available to the info ward all dependent how far all of the
[3:01:17.380 --> 3:01:22.820]  employers have wanted to go and it's an ongoing condition as to how much we implement of what
[3:01:22.820 --> 3:01:28.900]  is available to us but the facts of the truth create tremendous publicity and just god bless

[3:01:43.460 --> 3:01:48.340]  you the mainstream media keeps going he's an actor why didn't he just shut up a you're an
[3:01:48.340 --> 3:01:55.620]  american citizen b you're a father uh c you've been a director writer a very accomplished person
[3:01:55.620 --> 3:02:01.860]  ronald reagan was an actor hey good point the the the governor of california is an actor
[3:02:01.860 --> 3:02:09.380]  that's a load of crap they they just wish they were charlie sheen well i mean you can say that
[3:02:09.380 --> 3:02:17.140]  alec i of course can't but yeah now but i think it's interesting what what what mark said is
[3:02:17.140 --> 3:02:25.620]  that uh they abuse the uh did the the media that they that they so uh you're responsibly
[3:02:25.620 --> 3:02:32.740]  control and um sorry there's a jet um and and i'm trying to utilize it in a more responsible
[3:02:32.740 --> 3:02:39.860]  fashion you know well look just outside the paradigm you're deviating from the false reality
[3:02:39.860 --> 3:02:45.300]  and they don't want you to say look the emperor is wearing no clothes exactly i mean listen what
[3:02:45.300 --> 3:02:50.580]  you've done seismic it's going to continue to have effects for years much bigger than last
[3:02:50.580 --> 3:02:56.180]  time you went public i mean it's already probably 10 times more media attention than 2006 but i'm
[3:02:56.180 --> 3:03:00.900]  here to tell you buddy this is going to have seismic effects i hope so alec i hope so and
[3:03:00.900 --> 3:03:05.940]  and what i'm really proud of and what i'm really excited about is is the fact that that now there's
[3:03:05.940 --> 3:03:12.580]  a document i have delivered a document that is ingrained into the landscape of the movement
[3:03:12.580 --> 3:03:17.860]  now people that that you know couldn't perhaps couldn't focus the argument now have a document
[3:03:17.860 --> 3:03:22.820]  to lay in front of their doubters and say okay you don't want to listen to me just read this

[3:03:32.420 --> 3:03:38.100]  and it's just i think we've given them a real powerful tool that that that now exists in the

[3:08:40.580 --> 3:08:48.660]  that i admire uh here it is fbi dot gov forward slash wanted forward slash top 10 forward slash
[3:08:48.660 --> 3:08:59.140]  fugitive forward slash laden htm and he is not wanted for 9 11 says ben laden is wanting a connection
[3:08:59.140 --> 3:09:05.220]  with the august 7th 98 bombings of the united states embassies in dar salam tanzania and
[3:09:05.220 --> 3:09:11.060]  noroby kenya these attacks killed over 200 people in addition ben laden is a suspect another terrorist
[3:09:11.060 --> 3:09:16.980]  attacks throughout the world and at the top it says he's wanted for attacking americans abroad
[3:09:16.980 --> 3:09:22.340]  so there it is and the fbi's been been questioned by the press we have links that they say because
[3:09:22.340 --> 3:09:28.020]  we don't have evidence he carried it out uh charlie sheen is our guest these are one of the
[3:09:28.020 --> 3:09:32.100]  questions that charlie sheen is asking i'm actually looking at his page also alex
[3:09:32.100 --> 3:09:37.780]  it would seem after yesterday's uh
[3:09:37.780 --> 3:09:45.940]  audio tape that uh it would have jumped on here but um i guess it didn't uh you know
[3:09:45.940 --> 3:09:53.620]  not to mention that the the prior 20 or 30 tapes uh didn't deliver him as a you know
[3:09:53.620 --> 3:09:59.780]  i don't have a suspect as well um i mean how do you how do you argue this what do you uh
[3:09:59.780 --> 3:10:04.180]  uh let's you know i like let's jump on the other side for one second okay
[3:10:06.580 --> 3:10:12.180]  okay can we do that can we let's do it can we uh lobotomize ourselves for one second
[3:10:12.180 --> 3:10:17.940]  okay and jump on the other side what's the argument for this just come at me and any
[3:10:17.940 --> 3:10:24.980]  you know intelligent to uh logical well we've already indicted him for other bombings so
[3:10:24.980 --> 3:10:29.860]  we're not going to list killing 3 000 people on it okay that's not going to hold up in a
[3:10:29.860 --> 3:10:35.540]  court of law what what's the next argument we're so busy trying to protect you from al-qaeda we
[3:10:35.540 --> 3:10:42.180]  don't have time to indict him yeah and if you indict him al-qaeda is going to nuca major city
[3:10:42.180 --> 3:10:49.860]  that's what cheney said got it got it wow and uh eight years later we can't find him but all these
[3:10:49.860 --> 3:10:55.620]  cia and military people say every time they had him in their sights they were ordered to stand down
[3:10:55.620 --> 3:11:01.860]  and the cia flew uh eight thousand taliban and al-qaeda out to safety into pakistan
[3:11:02.900 --> 3:11:08.180]  the air and the fbi translator yeah the airlift of evil yeah and the and the fbi translator says
[3:11:08.180 --> 3:11:16.420]  that they work for the cia no no no i said that i said that those were my words remember
[3:11:16.420 --> 3:11:21.860]  that's right how dare you point out what what the fbi whistleblower said yeah that's right
[3:11:21.860 --> 3:11:28.260]  yeah the nerve of me you said that to hurt the family of course of course crackpot actor yes
[3:11:29.620 --> 3:11:36.740]  like ronald reagan the crackpot actor yes he was a b actor you're an a plus actor well thank you
[3:11:36.740 --> 3:11:41.300]  i'm sure there's a decent performance somewhere in his resume but i don't think it occurred in
[3:11:41.300 --> 3:11:46.740]  his presidency but that's another issue the tv show sponsored by general electric where he was
[3:11:46.740 --> 3:11:53.380]  friends with the monkey that's the one i'm not bashing reagan it's just no by the yardstick
[3:11:53.380 --> 3:11:58.180]  if you're an actor you're a piece of crap according to the media then ronald reagan's bad yeah
[3:11:59.140 --> 3:12:05.300]  yes and he would have a free term or if not for the limits and of course watson agar were not
[3:12:05.300 --> 3:12:12.020]  allowed to have him as a governor if he was an actor yes yeah charlie i want to go to some more
[3:12:12.020 --> 3:12:16.180]  calls here and then make our big announcement okay should we just make the big announcement now or

[3:12:41.860 --> 3:12:47.700]  undebatable that's why they won't debate you that's why they are delaying they are planning
[3:12:47.700 --> 3:12:53.540]  they are preparing well just like you said we're militiamen he is actually wolverine one

[3:13:02.420 --> 3:13:09.460]  is to continue the attack because they are on the defensive that's a good point now that's a very
[3:13:09.460 --> 3:13:15.060]  good point well i just want to add that if we don't expose false flag terror they're going to stage
[3:13:15.060 --> 3:13:22.580]  more so we are in a race here with time go ahead that's the only thing they know to do so they are
[3:13:22.580 --> 3:13:29.300]  going to do more false flag terror that's undebatable do you have a question or a statement for charlie
[3:13:29.300 --> 3:13:33.700]  or something you'd like to ask i wanted i want to talk about the taxpayer march on washington
[3:13:33.700 --> 3:13:41.060]  in particular real quick it was a failure why wonderful to have a number of americans stand
[3:13:41.060 --> 3:13:48.500]  up for their country and their rights but the rockefellers and the republicans are the ones
[3:13:48.500 --> 3:13:53.540]  that will ultimately win if we're not careful all right listen i'm going to go ahead and jump
[3:13:53.540 --> 3:13:57.860]  though that's another subject thank you so much randy let's talk to john and florida you're on the
[3:13:57.860 --> 3:14:04.900]  air with charlie sheen hey uh yeah i really think that the you two guys are shining you know we got

[3:15:45.700 --> 3:15:52.180]  to ride it and stay level with it and be the voices you are and then when it's all over and uh you
[3:15:52.180 --> 3:15:57.620]  have like half a million people giving you a round of applause both of you and i want to turn around
[3:15:57.620 --> 3:16:03.300]  and then say that's what i'm gonna salute the flag god bless you sir well that's a very powerful
[3:16:03.300 --> 3:16:08.420]  statement thank you sir it's come out the chain he did want to blow up our own ship so it's not
[3:16:08.420 --> 3:16:14.900]  impossible that this is going to come out it's not impossible at all that's why they're so scared
[3:16:14.900 --> 3:16:18.500]  charlie before we take some more calls and come back and make the big announcement sure you made
[3:16:18.500 --> 3:16:23.620]  the challenge last week in your own words i mean i'm not saying you should dance on the roof here
[3:16:23.620 --> 3:16:28.900]  but what do you want to say to mccain's daughter and to o'reilly and to hanity and all those and
[3:16:28.900 --> 3:16:35.380]  this other pinhead you've challenged them to a debate sure and they are cowards they will not
[3:16:35.380 --> 3:16:43.780]  like men face you uh i i i i i it doesn't make any sense i mean they they've already got all the
[3:16:43.780 --> 3:16:49.700]  material there's no surprises i'm just coming out there with my letter with the bullet points
[3:16:49.700 --> 3:16:54.580]  let's just let's just focus on that you know let's just focus on that that's all there's no
[3:16:54.580 --> 3:17:01.620]  surprises guys you know there's no surprises i mean uh i uh you know we could appeal to their
[3:17:02.420 --> 3:17:07.860]  to their egos and might have might enhance the viewership well obviously they know having you
[3:17:07.860 --> 3:17:12.420]  want to get them top ratings your publicist said you have tv calling every day but you refuse to
[3:17:12.420 --> 3:17:17.620]  do it you're very private that's the whole issue they can have charlie sheen on for a debate but
[3:17:17.620 --> 3:17:22.660]  they're chicken there's another word i would add to that they are crapping their pants because
[3:17:22.660 --> 3:17:27.700]  they've read your letter folks get his 20 minutes with the president off info wars dot com and
[3:17:27.700 --> 3:17:33.380]  present planet dot com email it to everybody again and and point out these cowards are afraid to
[3:17:33.380 --> 3:17:39.700]  debate him on this get his video message put it everywhere print them off mail them to everybody
[3:17:39.700 --> 3:17:45.780]  in your area to talk show host uh sometimes a a million copies of a book can change the world
[3:17:45.780 --> 3:17:50.020]  there's already millions of copies of 20 minutes with the president out there let's expand what
[3:17:50.020 --> 3:17:56.660]  we're doing and know that they're scared how about this i like how about this hey cnn mentioned the
[3:17:56.660 --> 3:18:04.580]  story cnn have the balls to just give a small link to the entertainment maybe just a tiny little
[3:18:04.580 --> 3:18:12.740]  blurb sheen to question obama sheen demands an audience something anything no they're scared of
[3:18:12.740 --> 3:18:16.980]  it even though it's a major news story charlie you've got some more tricks up in your sleeves in
[3:18:16.980 --> 3:18:21.460]  the next few weeks coming up there'll be more developments here for folks and perhaps we can
[3:18:21.460 --> 3:18:27.780]  get you to pop in and give us updates but again you've already really put 911 truth on the front
[3:18:27.780 --> 3:18:31.860]  burner uh and if people will just continue to spread 20 minutes with the president and the
[3:18:31.860 --> 3:18:37.460]  video uh it's it's it's it's causing seismic changes you know what i like let me just mention
[3:18:37.460 --> 3:18:41.140]  this also make sure people tune into the red carpet on sunday for the enemies because
[3:18:41.700 --> 3:18:48.020]  you know i got a billion people watching and it's live so that's no threat or challenge is just the
[3:18:48.020 --> 3:18:56.340]  truth all right uh let's cram one more call in let's talk to uh jim and mill walkie wisconsin
[3:18:56.340 --> 3:19:03.140]  go ahead jim quickly hi alex and charlie uh jim how are you i'm doing great uh thanks for all
[3:19:03.140 --> 3:19:08.660]  you're doing to expose the truth regarding 911 uh let me tell you a little bit about myself i've
[3:19:08.660 --> 3:19:16.100]  been a firefighter for over 30 years i voted for george bush twice but i recently woke up regarding
[3:19:16.100 --> 3:19:24.660]  the truth about 911 30 years ago i was told when i entered the fire service they said telephone
[3:19:24.660 --> 3:19:33.140]  telegraph telefiremen in other words firemen have big mouths they talk telephone telegraph
[3:19:33.140 --> 3:19:40.260]  telefiremen and if you could get the word out to the firefighters because the firefighters from 911
[3:19:40.260 --> 3:19:46.580]  they were not only heroes they were victims i hear you let me let me throw this in russia today of
[3:19:46.580 --> 3:19:52.100]  all people did interviews with fire with a fire captain and we posted it on info wars yesterday
[3:19:52.100 --> 3:19:55.540]  and he's saying no i've looked at the evidence and it just freaks you out when you look at the
[3:19:55.540 --> 3:20:04.100]  evidence of 911 being an inside job i have been to five 911s and maybe a third half of the firemen
[3:20:04.100 --> 3:20:09.460]  would wave at you and thank you now the majority buy you dinner pat you on the back i had police
[3:20:09.460 --> 3:20:17.460]  captains they keep it up jones just two years ago on record the firemen and police a lot of them
[3:20:17.460 --> 3:20:23.700]  are awake in new york the media won't go talk to them though charlie your comments on that the media
[3:20:23.700 --> 3:20:28.900]  doesn't fight fires these guys fight fires they know what fires do they know how fires behave
[3:20:28.900 --> 3:20:35.540]  they know what fires are capable of period the end the media wasn't the media wasn't there these
[3:20:35.540 --> 3:20:45.060]  guys were period the end these guys were there anything else jim and milwaukee yeah my idea is
[3:20:45.060 --> 3:20:50.900]  is is if you could collect interviews from just the firemen because that's what really convinced
[3:20:50.900 --> 3:20:55.860]  me when i saw that john schroeder he was it wearing that green shirt kind of a meatball looking guy
[3:20:55.860 --> 3:21:01.460]  but when he was talking about how he was thrown about like like a pinball how he ran out of that
[3:21:01.460 --> 3:21:07.700]  that that fire uh like a bunch of they ran out like a bunch of cockroaches that you know that
[3:21:07.700 --> 3:21:12.900]  gritty earthy language that convinced me that guy well i mean we've got hundreds of firefighters
[3:21:12.900 --> 3:21:16.980]  saying it was like lava there were bombs going off they told us to get back they were going to
[3:21:16.980 --> 3:21:23.060]  blow it we've interviewed police emergency workers saying the same thing it's on video that day live
[3:21:23.060 --> 3:21:27.780]  police going they're blowing building seven get back and then i talked to the emergency workers
[3:21:27.780 --> 3:21:33.540]  who heard the countdown ten nine eight seven six and he's like what's the countdown they're blowing
[3:21:33.540 --> 3:21:39.140]  it run for your lives boom boom boom boom boom i mean that's all covered my film truth rising
[3:21:39.140 --> 3:21:47.540]  exactly but if if you could collect uh and make maybe a 30 minute dvd just aim that fireman
[3:21:47.540 --> 3:21:53.540]  because if if the fireman knew it it'd be like starting fire fighter engineering said all three
[3:21:53.540 --> 3:21:58.660]  of the towers were impossible in their major national magazine biggest and oldest firefighter
[3:21:58.660 --> 3:22:04.180]  publication but yes you're right charlie sheen again you talk about a bottomless pit of evidence
[3:22:04.180 --> 3:22:10.500]  yeah i mean right there firefighting engineering says it's a cover-up yeah but it you know
[3:22:11.140 --> 3:22:18.900]  sean hannity didn't agree so it must not be true ellen pathetic and then he's another fake bush
[3:22:18.900 --> 3:22:23.860]  triples the size of government hannity's a conservative glenn beck supports the banker
[3:22:23.860 --> 3:22:30.820]  bailout yeah uh the democrats are now supporting obama increasing troops yeah incidentally everybody
[3:22:30.820 --> 3:22:37.460]  needs to read your open letter on info wars to glenn beck it's fabulous uh it's not as good as what
[3:22:37.460 --> 3:22:43.780]  you wrote doesn't matter doesn't matter not a contest no i know i know it's just um i'm i just i saw
[3:22:43.780 --> 3:22:48.260]  you really craft your letter to the president minds that i mean beck is something else let's
[3:22:48.260 --> 3:22:56.020]  take another call here let's talk to uh marino in new jersey or on the air marino hey hey james
[3:22:56.020 --> 3:23:02.980]  and uh charlie how you guys doing doing how are you i'm doing great um i i'd like to say that i'm
[3:23:02.980 --> 3:23:08.580]  proud for you to that you you came out with that uh with that transcript with the 20 bullet points
[3:23:08.580 --> 3:23:14.340]  i mean like wow that was just genius oh i mean a lot of thank you a lot of people that like i've
[3:23:14.340 --> 3:23:19.540]  i've been talking to i've been i've been saying this is just like a huge blow to the truth movement
[3:23:19.540 --> 3:23:24.660]  when in fact it's not because once it reaches the consensus of people it will just reach the
[3:23:24.660 --> 3:23:30.500]  method it'll just keep on expanding and just serve so that was co until pro day one trying to spin
[3:23:30.500 --> 3:23:35.620]  this knowing how dangerous it was the new world order and they failed it blew past all that
[3:23:35.620 --> 3:23:41.860]  this info uh they love to get us in fighting with each other instead of facing the new world order
[3:23:41.860 --> 3:23:48.900]  and it failed charlie your comments on that well yeah no they uh they were looking for any angle
[3:23:48.900 --> 3:23:57.380]  to expose um and and what they were doing in turn was uh was it directing more attention to the
[3:23:57.380 --> 3:24:03.220]  document the letter which is what we planned yeah absolutely yeah these people cannot help themselves
[3:24:03.860 --> 3:24:09.460]  and and they they played right into our hands and then we're really grateful for all their all
[3:24:09.460 --> 3:24:12.340]  their support and all their exposure of 20 minutes of the president
[3:24:12.340 --> 3:24:19.460]  you are truly grateful alex oh charlie you're something else man
[3:24:20.900 --> 3:24:25.380]  something else charlie sheen in the time we've got left here it's always great having you
[3:24:25.940 --> 3:24:31.700]  uh big announcement charlie i'm gonna in the next week all it's gonna be a month-long contest
[3:24:31.700 --> 3:24:37.700]  we'll post the rules details but you announce the contest you are the judge and you're paying
[3:24:37.700 --> 3:24:43.620]  out the cash prize right now or after the break uh it's a final segment go ahead and oh okay
[3:24:43.620 --> 3:24:52.500]  we um uh there is a contest um that is um is uh directly related to 20 minutes with the president
[3:24:52.500 --> 3:25:01.460]  and what we are requesting is that um is that any man woman or child um regardless of race um
[3:25:01.460 --> 3:25:09.220]  sit down and put on video on video two characters actually reading 20 minutes with the president
[3:25:09.220 --> 3:25:13.700]  somebody plays me somebody plays the president and what alex and i are going to do is we're
[3:25:13.700 --> 3:25:16.740]  going to take all the video submissions if you want to read the whole thing if you want to
[3:25:16.740 --> 3:25:21.940]  read a portion of it if you want to do if you if you if however you interpret it whatever language
[3:25:21.940 --> 3:25:27.460]  you interpret it um we're going to take those video submissions and alex and i are going to
[3:25:27.460 --> 3:25:34.980]  uh decide on on who the winner is um and it may not be based on performance it may be based on
[3:25:34.980 --> 3:25:41.060]  other elements of of the presentation solely our discretion it's our discretion yeah and there is
[3:25:41.060 --> 3:25:49.300]  a ten thousand dollar cash prize to the winner um but but in addition to that we're also going to
[3:25:49.300 --> 3:25:58.260]  take um from all the submissions a a a a small segment and we're going to put it all together
[3:25:58.260 --> 3:26:03.140]  so there is a universally created 20 minutes with the president as well we'll have the
[3:26:03.140 --> 3:26:09.300]  winners video and then we'll have the compilation video as um as a representation for all the
[3:26:09.300 --> 3:26:17.140]  voices that that that that step forward and have the courage to commit this thing to a video record
[3:26:17.140 --> 3:26:23.380]  and and and and make themselves available for the world to uh to observe and we're really excited
[3:26:23.380 --> 3:26:30.100]  about it and we're excited about that the youtube video my message to obama is blowing up right now
[3:26:30.100 --> 3:26:38.900]  and so we think that that once the theatrical uh versions brought the the fan versions um
[3:26:38.900 --> 3:26:45.700]  is is is going to drive this thing um beyond supernova hopefully approaching dark matter
[3:26:45.700 --> 3:26:52.500]  absolutely we have our own private scale back when i said 90s in 2006 it's gone supernova
[3:26:53.060 --> 3:26:59.300]  he goes nova supernova black hole super black hole dark matter on how big we want this to be but
[3:26:59.300 --> 3:27:04.580]  we'll probably get 200 300 400 submissions all of those will get thousands apiece
[3:27:04.580 --> 3:27:10.420]  and the winner will get hundreds of thousands there's thousands of versions uh more than 500
[3:27:10.420 --> 3:27:17.700]  i've counted now i had to quit counting on youtube uh over 200 with the same title of your message of
[3:27:17.700 --> 3:27:24.340]  the president our videos approaching 600 000 it's several million conservatively in just that video
[3:27:24.340 --> 3:27:29.780]  that is so effective you and erin did a great job putting that together charlie thank you thank you
[3:27:29.780 --> 3:27:35.060]  and so phase two for those that don't know it's going to be hundreds and hundreds of videos
[3:27:35.060 --> 3:27:39.460]  with people doing all of 20 minutes with the president part of it theatrically
[3:27:39.460 --> 3:27:43.460]  two white guys two black guys two women a woman and a man however you want
[3:27:44.020 --> 3:27:47.620]  whatever way you want to put it on whatever touches our hearts the most whatever
[3:27:47.620 --> 3:27:51.460]  whatever charlie's the main judge i'm going to kind of boil down because he probably can't
[3:27:51.460 --> 3:27:57.860]  watch 300 or 400 but alem but alem i'm going to watch as many as i can because to me that that
[3:27:57.860 --> 3:28:02.420]  that that is such a compliment that that people would take the time have the interest have the
[3:28:02.420 --> 3:28:11.300]  passion to sit down and and and bring this document uh to life and and and have the courage to to
[3:28:11.300 --> 3:28:16.500]  share it with the world how about this be part of the price too uh we'll announce the details

[3:44:20.020 --> 3:44:25.140]  because of the alternative media i'm calling satellite radio today i got four radios i'm
[3:44:25.140 --> 3:44:29.700]  canceling two of them i want to find out how i can get your tape because i'm through with it

[3:44:35.300 --> 3:44:42.100]  under royal order the triumph of criminalism the global hegemony of masonic intelligence

[3:44:47.300 --> 3:44:53.060]  really interesting um yes i won't talk to you about that later but i want i want to say this alex
[3:44:53.060 --> 3:44:59.300]  hollywood put forth a concerted effort to elect obama and my question is this and that's going
[3:44:59.300 --> 3:45:04.820]  out to hollywood then the la la land as they call it if they put forth that kind of effort to elect
[3:45:04.820 --> 3:45:11.540]  obama why won't they get behind charlie sheen to demand that the truth gets out about what happened
[3:45:11.540 --> 3:45:18.740]  on 9 11 still having nightmares about it oh i wish that i would have gone to you i just a great
[3:45:18.740 --> 3:45:22.820]  point now that's what charlie's saying i mean he didn't expect them all to line up behind him but
[3:45:23.620 --> 3:45:27.780]  he he goes i mean he knows a lot of these people and a lot of people he he talks to
[3:45:27.780 --> 3:45:32.980]  don't believe the official story and they're just scared to speak out and he's like how do you let
[3:45:34.660 --> 3:45:39.220]  these people get away with what they've done and charlie knows you know he uh that
[3:45:39.220 --> 3:45:44.580]  he's just a hollywood star but he's a smart intelligent guy he doesn't have some huge view
[3:45:44.580 --> 3:45:51.140]  himself he understands though the power position of a major tv slash movie star and so he's doing
[3:45:51.140 --> 3:45:56.740]  this knowing he'll be attacked because it's the right thing to do i mean that's what's so selfless
[3:45:56.740 --> 3:46:02.340]  about this i mean i frankly told charlie about three months ago he said i feel like i ought to do
[3:46:02.340 --> 3:46:06.820]  something or go public and i said they're gonna attack you but i said do it if you want and
[3:46:06.820 --> 3:46:10.900]  i said do it if you want and then about a month and a half ago he said can you fly out here and i
[3:46:10.900 --> 3:46:15.220]  said yeah i'm already out there doing stuff with jesse ventura consulting on their tv show mainly
[3:46:15.220 --> 3:46:20.740]  but also appearing in it i said i'll come over for a few days and he said i have this idea and i
[3:46:20.740 --> 3:46:24.820]  was sitting around talking to him and some of his family when they were over visiting and
[3:46:24.820 --> 3:46:29.380]  they're like well this is just positive questions and this is all public record they won't attack him
[3:46:29.380 --> 3:46:35.140]  for this and i said yeah they're gonna attack you charlie they're gonna misinterpret and they're
[3:46:35.140 --> 3:46:42.660]  going to put words in your mouth because that's what they do and they did but now he wants to
[3:46:42.660 --> 3:46:48.580]  fight even more because he is not a coward and he's gone through so much hell for what he did
[3:46:48.580 --> 3:46:53.380]  three years ago i mean if i told people half the crap i know about people wouldn't believe it i mean
[3:46:53.380 --> 3:46:58.260]  look at mark cuban i was asked not to talk about that at the time but it came out in the new york
[3:46:58.260 --> 3:47:03.140]  times the white house called him up and said listen you son of a bitch we're gonna put your
[3:47:03.140 --> 3:47:07.700]  ass in prison for insider trading because you're a rich guy that owns a lot of stock and the way
[3:47:07.700 --> 3:47:12.340]  the stock rules are if they selectively enforce everything's illegal and they sent him an email
[3:47:12.340 --> 3:47:19.060]  saying it too and that's and then they indicted him i mean these people don't play games i'd like
[3:47:19.060 --> 3:47:23.140]  to see all these other schmoes out there that don't have a hundred million dollars in the bank like
[3:47:23.140 --> 3:47:29.460]  charlie sheen risking everything to tell the truth your comments on that herb you know what my comment
[3:47:29.460 --> 3:47:37.060]  is this al sharpton uh one ballantine joe maddison you are fired all i want to know is how i can get
[3:47:37.060 --> 3:47:42.580]  the alex jones show on tape when i'm not even record there's only one program on radio people
[3:47:42.580 --> 3:47:48.180]  that is worth recording and i recorded every day off the internet that is the alex jones show
[3:47:48.180 --> 3:47:53.620]  now alex as full as this um left right paradigm the problem that's the problem that we're having
[3:47:53.620 --> 3:47:57.940]  people don't realize that it's not a left right issue it's the issue of an illegal
[3:47:57.940 --> 3:48:04.260]  uh private central bank that is destroying this country and you know what alex i agree with you
[3:48:04.260 --> 3:48:09.300]  100 percent i'm at the point where i don't believe they even care if they set up a type of a nuke
[3:48:09.300 --> 3:48:16.340]  and blow up a city just to bring this country into the new world order that's it that's it
[3:48:16.340 --> 3:48:19.860]  whether you're left or right black or white you're going to get the short end of the stick
[3:48:19.860 --> 3:48:25.060]  unless we beat these bankers i mean that's it glenn beck works for the same people obama do and
[3:48:25.060 --> 3:48:29.220]  they're just meant to fight with each other and get us fighting with each other while the bankers

[3:54:54.580 --> 3:54:58.740]  exactly no that's what it is and then and then and then he'll be in control the revolution
[3:54:58.740 --> 3:55:05.140]  and then he will deliver us right into a republicans hand and either obama they were thinking
[3:55:05.140 --> 3:55:09.860]  about closing the doors on us with obama but because we shot down his cult of personality
[3:55:09.860 --> 3:55:17.620]  it may be the next guy that's going to be the real dictator wow okay yeah that's how the scam
