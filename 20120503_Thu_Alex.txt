[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:26.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:26.000 --> 00:35.000]  We have got news that is so big, it is probably the biggest news I've ever covered.
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  To go back 10 years ago, I would say that every once a year, because things would get progressively crazier.
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  The last few years, I say it every couple months.
[00:45.000 --> 00:52.000]  I routinely say this is some of the biggest news, but this, other than 9-11 being an inside job,
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  and what that means, that criminals run the government that work with Al Qaeda.
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  That's now out in the open.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  We're told that war is over, move along, homeland securities for the American people, returning veterans.
[01:04.000 --> 01:12.000]  This piece of news confirmed double-vetted by Paul Watson, because I wanted to believe this wasn't true,
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  but it's on the official GovTrack sites.
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  It was first leaked, now it's hidden in plain view.
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  This is so big.
[01:23.000 --> 01:25.000]  Now, we already know this.
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  We already knew this.
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  I've been to the urban warfare drills.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  I'd already observed it.
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  I didn't need the government and media to tell me what I already knew.
[01:33.000 --> 01:42.000]  And I had the John Warren Defense Authorization Act, the NDAA, the Enemy Commissions Act, all of it.
[01:42.000 --> 01:51.000]  The Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, the Emergency Centers Establishment Act, the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[01:51.000 --> 01:58.000]  The massive ramping up the last few years for internment specialists domestically, those public ads.
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  I'm getting big chills right now.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  This morning, when Watson sent me this document and we went and checked it and confirmed and checked it in the Army Registry
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  that it is indeed a document that was marked classified and has now been leaked.
[02:14.000 --> 02:25.000]  And that it's on major GovTrack sites and contractor sites and is confirmed and ties in with the other FM3-39.40.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  It's just absolute confirmation.
[02:28.000 --> 02:36.000]  To be like being the police and you get a witness that says they got out of a basement and that the guy was burying little kids in there.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  And you go, you get a warrant.
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  You catch the guy when he's walking out his front door.
[02:40.000 --> 02:41.000]  You put him in handcuffs.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  You call in the specialist.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  You go in, you pull up the floorboards in the basement.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  There's a bunch of dead kids in there.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  That's what this is.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  We just took the floorboards up, man, and it's there.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  God, what does this say?
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  It says we better beat these people and take this country back because they're going to go ahead with this plan.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  Or you can evacuate the country.
[03:01.000 --> 03:08.000]  But if we don't turn this around politically, it's going to mean a total shooting war with these people.
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  And by the way, police and military, you know, I know what I'm talking about.
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  I have police officers and military calling in yesterday and I'm like,
[03:15.000 --> 03:24.000]  have you not been trained that every police department will be attacked by veterans with improvised explosive devices?
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  And the officer is like, he hesitated because they're told not to talk about it.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  And he goes, yeah, yeah, that's true.
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.000]  And have you not worked with the army in raiding people's houses?
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  Yes, we do.
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  Well, I don't need you to tell me that.
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  I've already been on this for, I've been really awake for 15 years.
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  I've been on air for 17.
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  The first few hours of mainline libertarian kind of a mainline Ron Paul type before Ron Paul was known or cool.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  You know, get rid of the Federal Reserve, cut taxes.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I went down the rabbit hole after that.
[04:01.000 --> 04:10.000]  And I just still, even though I know this and I'd already seen it with my own eyeballs,
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  it's so horrible.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  It's so horrible.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  It's so horrible.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  This totally confirms everything.
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  It is so horrible as if we needed more confirmation.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  But here it is.
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  In fact, I almost had Watson change the headline, but I'm just going to go with the headline he has.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  It should be the awful truth.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  Re-education camp, concentration camps for the American people confirmed.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  And yeah, it's conservatives, libertarians, veterans, police officers that don't go along.
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  You're to be taken to re-education, torture dungeons.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  And we have the documents. It's coming up after the break.
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  You might want to call your friends and family and tell them to tune in.
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.000]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.000]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there, Bar Nun, is ProPure.

[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.000]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.

[07:50.000 --> 08:13.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[08:20.000 --> 08:28.000]  We've got a lot of important news with Qin Guangcheng and the betrayal by the State Department in China.
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.000]  We've got flu study that sparks censorship.
[08:31.000 --> 08:37.000]  Fight is published at last for the super mega flu that can kill 90 plus percent of people.
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.000]  We have Oklahoma City whistleblower, hero, grandeur,
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.000]  Oppie Heidelberg dying of cancer.
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  That being announced yesterday.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  We have a top link in the middle of DrudgeReport.com.
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.000]  Rand Paul launches campaign to end the TSA.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  That's an infowars.com story.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  We've got a lot of news here.
[09:00.000 --> 09:01.000]  A lot.
[09:01.000 --> 09:14.000]  And Gerald Salente is going to be joining us in the third hour to talk about the economy, trends, and a host of other issues.
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  But I want to just stop the presses right here.
[09:18.000 --> 09:29.000]  I want to just get everybody's attention, everybody to listen to me very, very carefully.
[09:29.000 --> 09:39.000]  A decade ago, maybe once a year, I would get on air and say this is the biggest news I've ever covered.
[09:39.000 --> 09:51.000]  I remember coming back in 99 from an urban warfare drill in Oakland where I witnessed Marines and foreign troops practice taking over Oakland and San Francisco and confiscating guns.
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  And I came back with the video and I said this is the biggest news I've ever brought you.
[09:55.000 --> 10:03.000]  During Katrina in 2005, I said the fact that they sent regular big army in with National Guard to confiscate guns.
[10:03.000 --> 10:10.000]  They announced it on the news. This is the biggest news we've ever reported when it comes to our liberties in this country.
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.000]  9-11, of course, up until 2001, I said this is the biggest event ever.
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  It'll be used to take our liberties and you watch it'll then be flipped from al-Qaeda to the American people.
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.000]  That's now happened.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  There have been many of these benchmarks.
[10:23.000 --> 10:39.000]  But the article at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, breaking today in the last 30 minutes, is staggering in its import.
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  So I don't want to just cover this and then move on to the next thing.
[10:44.000 --> 10:59.000]  This confirms and validates everything that I have researched and seen in the last 17 years of deep focus.
[10:59.000 --> 11:22.000]  There is a giant underground semi-covert program to build a series of prison internment facilities at mothballed and current military bases, as well as sports stadiums, Walmart distribution centers, that's on record, and mothballed private prisons they've built.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  We already have the biggest prison population in the world, over 7 million.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  That's double what China with 1,300 million has.
[11:31.000 --> 11:32.000]  We're not just number one.
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  We're number one by light years.
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  And it's going to get worse.
[11:37.000 --> 11:43.000]  They are announcing arresting people for nothing and disappearing into a black hole.
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.000]  You know about the NDAA, the secret arrest and disappearance of citizens.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  First people denied that was in the bill.
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  Then it was admitted.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  Then Obama said he's going to veto it.
[11:52.000 --> 11:53.000]  I told you he wouldn't.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  Turned out he demanded it.
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.000]  He was just doing that so opposition wouldn't form.
[11:58.000 --> 11:59.000]  Then he said, don't worry.
[11:59.000 --> 12:00.000]  I won't use the power.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  Now he says he will.
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  That is a criminal government, 100%.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  And police and military, before I get to this new news, you have a decision to make.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  I can open the phones up for police right now.
[12:18.000 --> 12:25.000]  And they will call in and say, yes, we train with the military and yes, the military gets in plain clothes.
[12:25.000 --> 12:32.000]  Generally, you know, just police jackets that just say police and help us raid high threat targets.
[12:32.000 --> 12:40.000]  Mainly gun shop dealers, gun shop owners, veterans, people like that.
[12:40.000 --> 12:48.000]  Land rights people, folks like the man who had the little chicken farm up in Roswell, Georgia, and our intel is.
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  Then it fits in that brigade homeland was there and did kill him.
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  Why not?
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  Delta Force was used to kill the Davidians.
[12:55.000 --> 12:56.000]  The machine got him.
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  The Flutter footage was released.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  This has been a long term strategic program.
[12:59.000 --> 13:00.000]  I've gotten documents.
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  I've gotten eyewitnesses.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  Marine Corps officers to go public.
[13:03.000 --> 13:06.000]  In road to tyranny that came out 10 years ago.
[13:06.000 --> 13:16.000]  It came out in February of 2002.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  They were, well, he'd been a Marine Corps officer and become a police officer.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  Then become a computer software developer.
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  No longer a police officer driving down I-35.
[13:25.000 --> 13:32.000]  He'd heard my show about military checkpoints and I-35 just out to Austin and Kyle drives into a military checkpoint.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  They're pulling a lot of cars.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  He gets out and says this is illegal.
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  They yell at him.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  He showed me documents, photos, all of it.
[13:44.000 --> 13:51.000]  He was raiding gun shop owners as a Marine in the late 1980s in Norfolk, Virginia.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  Let me just stop there and give you the big news.
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  The point is that we have the Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  We have the John Warren Defense Authorization Act.
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  We have the enemy combatant designation.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  We have the NDAA.
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  Write these down, look these up.
[14:04.000 --> 14:05.000]  This is real.
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  Don't sit there and say, oh, I heard a rumor on Alex Jones.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  I'm giving you absolute proof.
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  Okay?
[14:13.000 --> 14:20.000]  The civilian inmate labor camp program started in the 80s, declassified in 97 by Clinton.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  Because he was proud of it.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  They had a dozen bases and they opened a dozen more.
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.000]  They had Army running state and federal prisoners just to train them how to run a prison on basis.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  But this was secret.
[14:33.000 --> 14:39.000]  There were, and still are, it's expanded, prisoners under Army control, civilian prisoners,
[14:39.000 --> 14:45.000]  and they could keep it secret from the early 80s under Rex 84 until 1997.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  Civilian inmate labor camp program.
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  I sent all this to Glenn Beck.
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  He was going to do a show on it.
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.000]  Fox told him no.
[14:53.000 --> 15:00.000]  So he had those Judas Goat, Benedict Arnold, arch traders, popular mechanics on,
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  looking like total slime.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  I mean, they're not even good liars.
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.000]  Shitting there like Sylvester with a canary in their mouth, lying to people and saying camps don't exist,
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  and building straw men and showing camps that we, I waited until the morning and they hadn't even done promos.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  And I said, I know what they're going to do.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  I told my crew months before when Beck was hyping it.
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.000]  I said they're going to go to well-known debunked FEMA sites that we've exposed to debunk.
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  And I said it that day and they did it.
[15:28.000 --> 15:34.000]  I know the mind of the enemy.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  I live this.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  I know what's going to happen.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  I'm getting the big breaking news in a moment, but you've got to hear the buildups.
[15:43.000 --> 15:53.000]  You understand the larger spectrum and I'm giving you only a snapshot, even though it sounds complex.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  By the way, Beck, you left Fox because they didn't want you to attack the New World Order anymore
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.000]  and you've done a better job since there's still time to repent and go public with the camps to your big audience.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  I don't want to get off into Glenn Beck.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  The point is there is no future if we don't stop this.
[16:06.000 --> 16:13.000]  Now, I had police and military calling in yesterday and I would ask them, hey, you work with the military and warrant service?
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  Yeah, we do.
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  You're not really supposed to talk about that.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  That's illegal.
[16:19.000 --> 16:20.000]  That's illegal.
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.000]  That's why it's kept secret.
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.000]  That's illegal.
[16:26.000 --> 16:36.000]  The answer is, well, we've just, you know, I have this Marine of Desert Storm One and some other operations drive me when Fox News wanted to interview me for ManCal.
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.000]  And I said, ManCal, I'm not flying there.
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  I've told them I don't want to be on Fox.
[16:41.000 --> 16:42.000]  They say I do.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  And he begged and begged and begged.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  You know, nice guy.
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  It's a side issue.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  And he said, just come to it by satellite.
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.000]  So, and Fox likes to send a car to make sure you show up on time.
[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  So here comes the car after the country.
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  He's got the Marine.
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  He's got the Marine, you know, button on and stuff.
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.000]  And he goes, Alex, you know, we've got Marines on the border for decades.
[17:01.000 --> 17:07.000]  You know, I'm like, yeah, I know you guys shot that US citizen goat herder there.
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  And he goes, yeah, well, you know, he raised up his BB gun.
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  I said, yeah, the guy was basically mentally retarded, but that was a side issue.
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  He thought he was telling me something about how, yeah, I know there's troops on the border.
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.000]  That's the point.
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  You leave it wide open.
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  The point is all this is illegal because Congress should be doing that.
[17:27.000 --> 17:34.000]  And it should be public and it should be to defend the border, not to control who can bring drugs in and who can't.
[17:34.000 --> 17:42.000]  The issue is there's a giant shadow government that now has been building this up and training, getting it ready for decades.
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  Really, since the 70s, heated up in the 80s, accelerated the 90s.
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  And now it is in full train.
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  You saw all those videos of tanks all over the country.
[17:52.000 --> 18:04.000]  Big, mile long, two mile long trains with Bradley fighting vehicles and other vehicles being delivered with Woodland and grassland camo paint jobs for the U.S.
[18:04.000 --> 18:10.000]  All over the country, desert to the Southwest, camo to Michigan.
[18:10.000 --> 18:17.000]  They are cashing these at secret backup points, not the local armory, which they know citizens may take.
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  They are cashing them and preparing for war.
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.000]  You've heard the military on this show.
[18:23.000 --> 18:34.000]  When they just talk about secession, the Texas Legislature, they were on alert in Oklahoma and Tennessee and Louisiana and New Mexico to invade the Texas.
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  You're like, oh, yeah, right.
[18:36.000 --> 18:44.000]  Oh, you didn't remember last year when the unanimous House said you can't grab people's genitals, DSA or the Fed say we're going to run a blockade.
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  And the Speaker of the House said, what does that entail? We'll put fighter jets in the air.
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  We will shoot down aircraft that enter the state of Texas.
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.000]  See, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  Perry, just to get political points, says we may have to have secession.
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  The Legislature talks about it.
[19:02.000 --> 19:05.000]  We have it in treaty rights, Lone Star State.
[19:05.000 --> 19:09.000]  Not really the only state that has that though, New Hampshire and others have right to revolt as well.
[19:09.000 --> 19:18.000]  And right to see they really all do but the stated in the founding and the voluntary entry by the treaty by the country of Texas.
[19:18.000 --> 19:23.000]  My forebears created with many of your forebears.
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  And they said, listen, we're going to put F-16s in the air.
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  We're going to militarily blockade you.
[19:29.000 --> 19:30.000]  This was Civil War.
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  That's how the Civil War started.
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  This is real.
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.000]  This is real.
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  And let me tell you what they're going to do when we get back.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  They're planning to roll this out.
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  They're planning to come arrest me.
[19:41.000 --> 19:54.000]  They're planning to arrest Rand Paul, Ron Paul, G. Edward Griffin, Gerald Salente, Joel Scalzen, George Norrie, Glenn Beck, Matt Drudge.
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  I'm not joking.
[19:55.000 --> 20:01.000]  Lick U.S. Army Document Outlines plan for reeducation camps in America, a political dissidence.
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  I've seen the ungevity products work for many others.
[20:03.000 --> 20:06.000]  And so I bought a bunch of them, started using them, had a little bit of results.
[20:06.000 --> 20:09.000]  But I wasn't following the regimen every day.
[20:09.000 --> 20:13.000]  But Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds.
[20:13.000 --> 20:17.000]  When I saw those results, I said, I'd better follow my own advice.
[20:17.000 --> 20:20.000]  I started taking the ungevity products, and it's been incredible.
[20:20.000 --> 20:23.000]  37 pounds in two months.
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  Our bodies are amazing.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  And God gave us an incredible gift.
[20:27.000 --> 20:35.000]  But if our body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals, and the other key essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy.
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.000]  Folks, this isn't hype.

[23:59.000 --> 24:19.000]  It's the top story at infowars.com leaked U.S. Army Document Outlines plan for reeducation camps in America.
[24:19.000 --> 24:25.000]  Well, what do you see in the KSLA TV piece about the clergy response team?
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.000]  They say, we work with the military that during martial law, you'll do what's required of you and submit in the camp
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  and take your force inoculations and turn your guns in and let your children be sent to another center.
[24:36.000 --> 24:42.000]  And they practice picking your kids up at the school, FEMA does and taking them away and not telling you where they go.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  This is all part of the martial law system.
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  That's why when somebody sees a gun, they lock down half the town where you live all the time.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  It's about training you to be a prisoner.
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  TSA, it's all prisoner training.
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  That's what happens when you get to a prison is they do what the TSA does.
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  It's prisoner induction.
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.000]  Leaked U.S. Army Document Outlines plan for reeducation camps in America.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  You want to see what it looks like in an urban warfare drill.
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  You can watch my film, Police State 2000.
[25:09.000 --> 25:13.000]  Or in the film that came out four years ago, Children of Men.
[25:13.000 --> 25:20.000]  When they're taking people into the camp processing area on the buses, that's exactly what Abu Ghraib and others look like.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  And the training they do over there, they admit is for here.
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000]  And they grab your wife, they grab your kids, and they got people working on these things that like to rape kids.
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  Remember, that's in the Army's own report on Abu Ghraib and other camps.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  Raping of children with battery acid.
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.000]  Look it up.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  I'm not joking.
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  Continue.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  Leaked U.S., that's Jeffrey Dahmer.
[25:43.000 --> 25:44.000]  That's what the good guys do now.
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  It's not the general military.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  It's special purve units.
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  Leaked U.S. Army Document Outlines plan for reeducation camps in America.
[25:53.000 --> 26:00.000]  Political activists would be pacified to sympathize with the government.
[26:00.000 --> 26:08.000]  This is a leaked U.S. Army Document prepared for the Department of Defense contains shocking plans for political activists to be pacified.
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  We're going to put that PDF on screen now.
[26:10.000 --> 26:25.000]  Again, leaked U.S. Army Document prepared for the Department of Defense contains shocking plans for political activists to be pacified by PSYOP psychological warfare officers into developing an appreciation of U.S. policies.
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.000]  This is domestically.
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.000]  It goes on to say, now that's teaching them how to have Stockholm syndrome.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  Enjoy their masters.
[26:33.000 --> 26:34.000]  And most cowards do.
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  They do a mind flip where they actually believe it.
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.000]  Thank you for torturing me, thank you for putting me in a labor camp.
[26:41.000 --> 26:55.000]  I understand my children need to be kept in another area and then the other minions in the camp will cattle on you and things creating a psychology that they have power and watch you be drug away and tortured because they heard you talk bad.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  And they'll actually start smiling and kissing the rear end of the abusers.
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  And this is what America is now.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  This happens in every other country.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  This is the gulag, archipelago.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  This is what Alexander Sultan eats and talked about.
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  You want to be slaves?
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  You got it.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  This is what you want.
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  This is what you get.
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  This is what you want.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  This is what you get.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  Let's come back with the theme song of hardware.
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  I think it's called The Order of Deaths, the name of the band.
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.000]  Let's try to find that.
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  Thank you.
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  Oh, let me continue.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  This is at infowars.com.
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  This is the number one story in America today.
[27:34.000 --> 27:37.000]  But you'll send it to friends and family and they won't even go look and find out it's real.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  Tell them to say, oh, that's not true.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  Oh, the NDAA isn't real.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  The checkpoints on the highways with the TSA isn't real.
[27:44.000 --> 27:45.000]  None of that's real.
[27:45.000 --> 27:54.000]  That's why I got so mad as sort of screaming at that guy yesterday who called up and he didn't deny that he had the National Guard marching around in Minnesota on the streets to condition people.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  He just said that I was being biased.
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  Oh, yeah, you bet I'm biased towards freedom.
[27:58.000 --> 28:09.000]  You bet I've been to dozens of urban warfare training drills and witnessed them trained to come in our houses and take our kids away from us and take our guns and beat the daylights out of us if we're lucky.
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.000]  You bet I'm biased against that pal.
[28:12.000 --> 28:21.000]  That's why I went into a rage because I'm so upset about what we're going into here and I want to turn it around.
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  But your level of denial out there is not helping folks.
[28:24.000 --> 28:31.000]  The document entitled FM three dash three nine dot 40.
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  By the way, I've got old manuals what they didn't Vietnam and stuff.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  This is right out of it when you read it.
[28:36.000 --> 28:47.000]  Resettlement and internment operations again internment resettlement operations PDF, which originally released on a restricted basis to DoD in February of 2010.
[28:47.000 --> 29:01.000]  Remember, that's when the documents came out about the massive ramp up and build up to hire tens of thousands of additional internment specialists for in the US during civil emergencies.
[29:01.000 --> 29:11.000]  And it said to run the barbed wire and the checkpoints and the different jobs you'd have and and then the crews getting the camps ready with water and latrines and all that.
[29:11.000 --> 29:20.000]  Billions of dollars being spent and Pentagon whistleblowers calling us and pointing out documents that were on the federal purchase order sites.
[29:20.000 --> 29:27.000]  And then the so-called Patriots all giving Jerry's Alex again fear mongering.
[29:27.000 --> 29:35.000]  Again, even our supposed people that are awake are so cowardly that they won't even admit how our strengths are.
[29:35.000 --> 29:39.000]  If we're going to get out of this, we're going to have to grow up and realize what's happening.
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  Let's try to shut up. We come back and just read Watson's article.
[29:43.000 --> 29:50.000]  But it is important to get this out to everybody now. It's at infowars.com.
[29:50.000 --> 30:01.000]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[32:59.000 --> 33:23.000]  This is what you want, this is what you get.
[33:23.000 --> 33:36.000]  This is what you want. This is what you get.
[33:36.000 --> 33:41.000]  You want tyranny? You want to laugh at people that are worried about it?
[33:41.000 --> 33:47.000]  This country is so soft and has hit so much freedom people have no idea
[33:47.000 --> 33:54.000]  the type of hardcore evil that has been premeditatedly developed and put in place.
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.000]  It is a program. I know exactly where it leads from history but in their own documents.
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.000]  It is guaranteed that the global elite are trying to bankrupt and break this country,
[34:06.000 --> 34:16.000]  destroy the family, bring in hellish Agenda 21 and reeducate this country.
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  In fact, we have the clip of the Attorney General saying,
[34:18.000 --> 34:24.000]  I met with the media to brainwash the public against guns. This is brainwashing.
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  That is why they have the military in all the schools now.
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.000]  I have worked in radio stations. I have been in 590 as a guest.
[34:32.000 --> 34:38.000]  When they bring in a Cyop officer with a book he has published about how great Afghanistan is.
[34:38.000 --> 34:44.000]  And the guy confronts me in the hall with his eyes twinkling getting off on the fact that he is a secret agent.
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  He said, man, you are a traitor.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  And he was in there running Cyop saying, this is like 5 years ago,
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  that well, Gruckheimer says we kill men, women and children.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  And then in the hall trying to intimidate me.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  So I just blew up at the guy and told him he was a traitor.
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.000]  I mean, just because, I want to say something, just because you have been brought into this
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.000]  as a senior police officer or military officer or bureaucrat or contractor,
[35:07.000 --> 35:10.000]  you are being fed Cyops and lies as well.
[35:10.000 --> 35:15.000]  Your future is being destroyed. Just because you have joined with this through peer pressure,
[35:15.000 --> 35:21.000]  they get you in and slowly test you and by approximation you will do anything.
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.000]  I mean, I don't need the police to call in. I have the documents.
[35:25.000 --> 35:32.000]  We first broke in 98 because the FBI showed up at an army checkpoint
[35:32.000 --> 35:37.000]  where Mike Hansen, my camera guy just ran into it on I-35 and they were telling him not to film.
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.000]  They were searching cars, searching buses and the FBI agent gives him a document
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.000]  and it says restricted. He goes, here's the press release and drives off.
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  They had the phone numbers, Fort Hood and the 77 counties it responds to,
[35:51.000 --> 35:58.000]  the other bases that respond to the other counties is in my film, The Takeover.
[35:58.000 --> 36:04.000]  And then I started talking to police officers over the years and I found out there was this giant secret program.
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.000]  They send the army, the Marines in, when a veteran won't give their guns up,
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.000]  when a farmer won't give their land up, the military's been killing Americans for at least 20 years,
[36:14.000 --> 36:20.000]  well since the late 80s that I know of, so 24 years or so.
[36:20.000 --> 36:29.000]  I'll explain again, the regular army and Marines kill citizens from my intel on a weekly basis.
[36:29.000 --> 36:35.000]  And once they get the police involved in something that's illegal, they're compromised.
[36:35.000 --> 36:42.000]  And again, our intel is that's why we can't get the Sheriff's Department, the Marshall's office and the police to say they were there.
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  And I've since made some calls and confirmed what the caller told us about family at the base.
[36:46.000 --> 36:52.000]  They sent Brigade Homeland and a Fort Steward in there to kill that guy that wouldn't come out of his house in Georgia.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  That's why their acting so freaked out when I sent reporters up there.
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  I knew, my nose smelled something on that, but it doesn't matter.
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  I have the interviews, I have the documents in other cases.
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.000]  Remember the head of Brigade Homeland in Army Times four years ago said,
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  yep, we're going to be pulling triggers on the American people.
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  We'll also be helping at car wrecks and things.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  That's the PR Cyop.
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  They said we're going to be pulling triggers.
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.000]  The Army Times didn't retract that.
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.000]  They just removed it two days after we pointed it out, but we saved it.
[37:24.000 --> 37:35.000]  That's why you have DWI checkpoints run by National Guard, Big Army, Marines, Air Force MPs are a big part of this.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  All right, continuing here.
[37:37.000 --> 37:44.000]  That's why at the Kentucky Derby, that's why at the Super Bowl, now at high school sports, the Army's there.
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.000]  And they're running security and they've got live ammo.
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  It's to get everybody acclimated.
[37:50.000 --> 37:56.000]  See, the evil people that have hijacked our government have to sell us that torture is good and sell us that checkpoints are good.
[37:56.000 --> 38:03.000]  And sell us that the TSA is good and sell us that tyranny is good and sell us that all these wars are good.
[38:03.000 --> 38:10.000]  And I heard a caller yesterday to a friend of mine, Jeff Ward show here locally in Austin on 590 a.m.
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  One of our local affiliates.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  And they were talking about Afghanistan 10 plus years later will it ever end.
[38:17.000 --> 38:24.000]  I heard a good old boy call in the ignorant type and he was associating and I'm going to get to the concentration camp news, the biggest breaking news ever.
[38:24.000 --> 38:30.000]  He was associating his power with a system and he said these people just keep killing each other.
[38:30.000 --> 38:35.000]  So we go in there and we say you quit killing each other or we're going to kill all of you.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  We'll just kill everybody in the country.
[38:37.000 --> 38:42.000]  And let me tell you, that's what I hear from a lot of people and it says we'll just parking lot them.
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  Most of these guys have never been there.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  Don't know the history.
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  Don't know that it's basically medieval over there.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  Those people aren't attacking us unless you attack them.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  It's a blood vendetta.
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  It's like people were in America until 50 years ago.
[38:58.000 --> 38:59.000]  You kill my brother.
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.000]  I kill you.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  That was the old rule.
[39:02.000 --> 39:09.000]  So we're these castrated men that but act tough all day and go just parking lot all the Arabs.
[39:09.000 --> 39:18.000]  Really the global banks hate you even more than those Arabs because they know you could revert back to being a caveman at any time, which is what they fear.
[39:18.000 --> 39:25.000]  They want the little metro sexual males running around, you know, being bossed around by their wives or girlfriends.
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  That's that's the end of the that's what they want.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  You understand that?
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  That's what all this is about.
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.000]  And I heard a caller calling it was so incredibly eloquent.
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  He was also passionate.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  He was like, I can't believe this is America.
[39:41.000 --> 39:59.000]  I can't believe George Washington froze his butt off at Valley Forge and crossed the Delaware and Trenton, New Jersey and went through all those battles over seven years so that we could talk about just genociding whole groups of people.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  He went on to say even Hitler when he went into a country didn't genocide everybody and say you can keep your culture.
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  This guy's like, you'll take our culture. You're dead.
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.000]  What is our culture?
[40:08.000 --> 40:15.000]  A plastic globalist fake facsimile garbage filled system.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  And the caller went on to say that's what the government does.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  They say we're going to give you shots.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.000]  We'll take your kids and you're going to not spank your kids.
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  We're going to do what we say or we're going to send SWAT teams.
[40:25.000 --> 40:32.000]  It's a bunch of global social engineers that telling us what we're going to do.
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  So that's what we're talking about here.
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  All right.
[40:36.000 --> 40:41.000]  Again, this is the biggest news I've ever covered because it confirms everything we already knew.
[40:41.000 --> 40:58.000]  I already know this, but the fact that this is on the major gov track sites and the fact that we separately have the bids, the bid process for all of this that government people have called up.
[40:58.000 --> 41:10.000]  I've had government employees high level, mid level, call up, say their names, be guest on the show and have the courage to come on and say, all right, let's walk through this on air going through these government purchase sites and these government bid sites.
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  You see this, you see that.
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  That's for the barbed wire.
[41:12.000 --> 41:13.000]  That's for the checkpoints.
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  That's for the internment specialist.
[41:15.000 --> 41:16.000]  That's for the...
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  Well, now we have the manual.
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  This is public.
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  This is confirmed.
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.000]  We now have the manual.
[41:27.000 --> 41:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, for how they're going to break the people up, how they're going to control them and how they're going to run psi ops on them.
[41:39.000 --> 41:47.000]  And we have the clergy response team stuff where they're going to have the preachers inducting people into these sprawling camps during the collapse.
[41:47.000 --> 41:53.000]  See, they'll also sell it that you need to be in it because of relocation, but then there's going to be prisoners who were troublemakers.
[41:53.000 --> 42:02.000]  See, there's going to be camps within camps, just like at Abu Ghraib or just like at Camp X-ray.
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  And they've got the whole charts of how they do it.
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  Now, this was secret.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  This got leaked, but this is now on the official government sites.
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  They're confirming it's real.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  And of course, doing an investigation so they can arrest whoever leaked it.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  Well, there's going to be more leaking.
[42:17.000 --> 42:23.000]  The globalists go full bore with all this, that there's going to end up being a major shooting war in this country.
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  And it's not going to be documents that are going to be leaking.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  It's going to be brains and guts and blood.
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.000]  And by the way, I've seen enough in life to know I'm not looking forward to that.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  And say, this is real, ladies and gentlemen, this is real.
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.000]  They plan to march the US military and the police right into the American people.
[42:41.000 --> 42:47.000]  And in a way, that's why they're teaching all the police, you will face veterans, you will have improvised explosive devices against you.
[42:47.000 --> 42:55.000]  When they're taking people's kids and taking people's guns and everything's collapsing, the feds will stage a few bombings up front to demonize the veterans.
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  But they'll be real attacks, actually.
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  They're planning a total civil war where people are forced.
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  Well, I can't go to the camp.
[43:03.000 --> 43:04.000]  You're not going to take my kids.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  And then these vets are going to go wait for people on the highway.
[43:08.000 --> 43:11.000]  They're going to wait for the cops in the military, and it's on.
[43:11.000 --> 43:15.000]  And again, the globalists plan to destroy our military with this.
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  They soft kill you with the vaccines and the rest of it.
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  They plan on you being defeated by the American people, and that's public.
[43:21.000 --> 43:30.000]  They admit they're going to use troops from 15 nations during civil emergencies to deal with insurrection and terrorist in LE09, FEMA.gov.
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  Type in in LE09, FEMA.gov.
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  You'll read it.
[43:37.000 --> 43:43.000]  I mean, this is so hardcore, the master plan to use us against each other to kill each other.
[43:43.000 --> 43:50.000]  And what do you do when they're coming to take you to some stinking camp and take your little children from you?
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  I mean, the police don't need to be told this.
[43:53.000 --> 43:56.000]  You understand you're going to face millions of people.
[43:56.000 --> 43:59.000]  You understand you're going to be absolutely stomped into the ground.
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  You understand that, don't you?
[44:02.000 --> 44:07.000]  And that's not talk. That's a real analysis.
[44:07.000 --> 44:11.000]  But that's the plan. We cannot allow this to take place.
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  Heaven help us. This is going to be so horrible.
[44:13.000 --> 44:19.000]  And again, think of all the things you didn't think would actually happen that have now happened.
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  Think about what we've turned into.
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.000]  We've got to repent and ask God to heal this country.
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.000]  And we've got to have the police and military speak out.
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  Heaven help us.
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.000]  And here's what's going to happen.
[44:30.000 --> 44:34.000]  Most of the militaries awake, 70-plus percent give their donations to Ron Paul.
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  A lot of the police are waking up right now.
[44:37.000 --> 44:40.000]  But the problem is, once we start killing each other, and they'll prime it,
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.000]  just like with the Shiites and the Sunnis, where they would blow up Mosque and stuff,
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.000]  the CIA and others, to get everybody fighting with each other.
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  MI6 got caught doing it.
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.000]  Israelis got caught, caught, caught, London Guardian.
[44:52.000 --> 44:57.000]  Once they get us killing each other, it'll just start up on its own.
[44:57.000 --> 45:01.000]  Listen, we've got to be smart enough to not do this.
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  That's why they've infiltrated militias.
[45:03.000 --> 45:06.000]  That's why they're always trying to get them to attack the military and police preemptively,
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  to start this war.
[45:08.000 --> 45:12.000]  That's why when my guys pulled up in Pittsburgh to talk to the military,
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  they called the police on them and said they were terrorists,
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  just for saying, hey, you're violating positive commentators.
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  The military was seeing us as enemies.
[45:19.000 --> 45:25.000]  But if you show the military the hat trick, if you show them how they've been manipulated,
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  it's so simple, they go, oh, oh, yeah, I get that now.
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  And then you show them all these documents and how this was all premeditated
[45:31.000 --> 45:34.000]  and how when they're out of the military, they're now the number one enemy.
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  Oh, that really, oh, yeah, they know you're going to get out of the military
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  and understand how you were fooled.
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  When you're 18, 20 years old, you're not.
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  That's why you're the enemy.
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  Let's continue.
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  That is the enemy of the globalist.
[45:49.000 --> 45:57.000]  A leaked U.S. Army document outlines plan for reeducation camps in America.
[45:57.000 --> 46:01.000]  Political activists would be pacified to sympathize with the government
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.000]  or to be given Stockholm syndrome is what it is.
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.000]  A leaked U.S. Army document prepared for the Department of Defense
[46:07.000 --> 46:10.000]  contains shocking plans for political activity.
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  This confirms the camps, which will confirm it.
[46:12.000 --> 46:17.000]  They said, oh, for emergencies, it confirms their political to be pacified
[46:17.000 --> 46:23.000]  by psychological warfare officers into developing an appreciation of U.S. policies.
[46:23.000 --> 46:29.000]  That means banker policies while detained in prison camps inside the United States.
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  What did I play just yesterday or two days ago?
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  Attention, attention, attention.
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  American forces are here to help remain calm.
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  We will not tolerate civil disobedience.
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  I shot that video you're saying.
[46:40.000 --> 46:47.000]  The show video in police 80,000 where they admit it's four citizens in America in gun confiscation.
[46:47.000 --> 46:54.000]  The manual, the document titled FM3-39.40, linked at infowars.com,
[46:54.000 --> 47:00.000]  internment and resettlement operations PDF was originally released on a restricted basis to DOD.
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.000]  Yeah, they can't even let regular military get this.
[47:02.000 --> 47:05.000]  In February of 2010, but it's now been made public.
[47:05.000 --> 47:07.000]  Yeah, leaked.
[47:07.000 --> 47:10.000]  The Department of Homeland Security and FEMA.
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  Oh, man.
[47:12.000 --> 47:14.000]  World Council, all of it.
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  Heaven help us.
[47:16.000 --> 47:21.000]  The Department makes it clear that the policies apply within U.S. territory and involve DOD support.
[47:21.000 --> 47:22.000]  I'm quoting.
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.000]  The U.S. civilian authorities for domestic emergencies.
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.000]  The Department of Homeland Security and FEMA.
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.000]  The Department of Homeland Security and FEMA.
[47:31.000 --> 47:34.000]  The Department of Homeland Security and FEMA.
[47:34.000 --> 47:40.000]  I'm quoting. The U.S. civilian authorities for domestic emergencies and for designated law enforcement and other activities,
[47:40.000 --> 47:46.000]  including manmade disasters, accidents, terrorist attacks and incidents in the U.S. and in territories.
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  Aside from enemy combat and other classification detainees,
[47:49.000 --> 47:54.000]  the manual includes the detention of civilian internees every time in Austin and everywhere else.
[47:54.000 --> 48:00.000]  They set up aircraft hangers or bus terminals and put barbed wire in them and put you inside.
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  And then run buses to make you sick.
[48:02.000 --> 48:03.000]  Oh, man, it's bad.
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  In other words, citizens who are detained for security reasons for protection
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  or because he or she committed an offense against the detaining power.
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  You hear that quote?
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  You're detained, permanently detained.
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  Once the detainees have been processed into the internment camp,
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.000]  the manual explains how they will be reeducated.
[48:21.000 --> 48:22.000]  You heard me right.
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.000]  It says reeducated.
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  And what has Obama said?
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  They say when they...
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.000]  Well, they say in the manuals under the FEMA Corps,
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.000]  when your parents are arrested, you're sent to a youth camp
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  where they put peer pressure on you
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  and they're even able to break most people's children and have them turn against their family.
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  And Rahm Emanuel told C-SPAN how they were going to do that,
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  how you'll be sent to these camps.
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  Let me tell you, you're not putting your filthy hands on my kids, you scumbags.
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  You understand that?
[48:51.000 --> 48:58.000]  Let me tell you, folks, this stuff all goes down.
[48:58.000 --> 49:04.000]  We have got total criminals in control
[49:04.000 --> 49:10.000]  who are taking an absolute blueprint of evil against us.
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.000]  It goes on.
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.000]  Once the detainees have been processed into the internment camp,
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  the manual explains how they will be reeducated
[49:20.000 --> 49:27.000]  with particular focus on targeting political dissenters.
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.000]  It goes into expressing support for U.S. policy.
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  The reeducation process is the responsibility of the Psychological Operations Officer,
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  also known as the Trader Against America, I should add,
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.000]  whose job it is to design shy-off products
[49:40.000 --> 49:46.000]  that are designed to pacify and acclimate detainees or DCs, as they're called,
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.000]  to accept U.S. or IR facility authority regulations.
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  That's U.N., ladies and gentlemen.
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  According to the document, that's a quote.
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  The following roles that are designed to the shy-off team
[49:58.000 --> 50:02.000]  identify as malcontents, trained agitators,
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  and political leaders from the facility.
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.000]  Oh, yeah.
[50:05.000 --> 50:10.000]  And it turned me over to the absolute torturers, man.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  Yeah, well, good luck.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  Good luck.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  Problem is, the coward torturers will sit back
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.000]  while troops are dying, bringing people into these pigs.
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.000]  Tell you what.
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  This is so evil.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  Identifies malcontents, trained agitators,
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  and political leaders within the facility
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  that may try to organize resistance or create disturbances.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  Yeah, you don't want to try to escape out of the camp of America.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  Oh, my God.
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.000]  Develops and executes indoctrination programs to reduce or remove
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  antagonistic attitudes.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  Identifies political activist.
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.000]  Provides loudspeaker support such as administrative announcements
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  to the facility.
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  Instructions when necessary.
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  I'm going to come back with the rest of it.
[50:58.000 --> 51:01.000]  I'm reading directly from the document.
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.000]  Attention, mindless criminals, thugs, and thieves.
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  Go ahead.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  Break a leg.

[51:28.000 --> 51:29.000]  Criminals, be forewarned.
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  Your leg will break before the door sentinel will budge.
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  Even if you have an alarm system,
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  back it up with the door sentinel.

[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  I've thought about this probably more than anybody out there,
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.000]  alive, who's on the side of liberty.
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  We're going to win.
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  Some of us aren't going to make it through this,
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  but that is not what matters.
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  Freedom.
[54:18.000 --> 54:19.000]  Freedom.
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  Freedom.
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.000]  Freedom.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  Freedom.
[54:22.000 --> 54:27.000]  Freedom and dignity, and honor, and innocence.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  Every time I look at my children,
[54:28.000 --> 54:29.000]  other people's children,
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  and how innocent and good they are,
[54:31.000 --> 54:35.000]  I realize that we just absolutely should be honored
[54:35.000 --> 54:40.000]  to fight this tyranny and should not be afraid at any level.
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.000]  The only fear you need to have is of not,
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  while you're alive this one time,
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  stand it up against these people in this test.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  But this is so real,
[54:49.000 --> 54:56.920]  these people in this test. But this is so real. And again, it's accelerated. It's
[54:56.920 --> 55:04.200]  built to a fever crescendo. My father was approached by a patient of 10 years
[55:04.200 --> 55:09.240]  who revealed to him he was a Homeland Security spy and wanted him to spy on
[55:09.240 --> 55:15.760]  his patients. My dad played along with it to discover more and found that it was
[55:15.760 --> 55:19.640]  real, called the card number, all of it, and then went to talk to the dentist at
[55:19.640 --> 55:24.800]  work under him and they had all been visited at their homes by other Homeland
[55:24.800 --> 55:29.440]  Security. Ladies and gentlemen, the average person gets approached by this and
[55:29.440 --> 55:32.840]  gets on a power trip. If you're out there listening and think you're special, a
[55:32.840 --> 55:39.520]  preacher, a doctor, a lawyer, a government person, a infraguard, corporate
[55:39.520 --> 55:43.120]  person, you think you're special, you're always told that you're known as a dupe,
[55:43.120 --> 55:49.440]  useful idiot, moron, okay? And the type of people, you know, my dad said that this
[55:49.440 --> 55:56.400]  person, you know, is very narcissistic, very weak. He said the Homeland
[55:56.400 --> 55:59.440]  Security people he talked to were the same way. Well, yeah, we're fighting an
[55:59.440 --> 56:05.240]  army of just scum. They, I mean, these people are filth, but they've got our
[56:05.240 --> 56:09.760]  military working for them. So what are they going to do when most of the
[56:09.760 --> 56:14.400]  military is awake? They're going to have stunts. They'll blow up Chicago with a
[56:14.400 --> 56:18.560]  nuke or they'll attack a bunch of bases with, with, with rogue groups and put
[56:18.560 --> 56:24.880]  patsies on TV and then say we attacked the military. But I don't see them getting
[56:24.880 --> 56:28.600]  away with it if we get this information out. You know, Ron Paul be on national
[56:28.600 --> 56:31.840]  shows and go, what about Alex Jones? You're on a show and admitted camps are
[56:31.840 --> 56:34.600]  going on. He goes, well, I'm not saying that's happening now, but it could be a
[56:34.600 --> 56:39.400]  danger. No, it's real. It's real. They don't want you knowing Homeland Security
[56:39.400 --> 56:44.360]  got Time Warner to ban the Jesse Ventura show that I basically haunched. I mean,
[56:44.360 --> 56:49.920]  that one episode was like 85% Alex Jones, you know, my, my seal. It was real and
[56:49.920 --> 56:54.520]  they went absolutely conniption ape threatening. Well, I'm not supposed to get
[56:54.520 --> 57:02.760]  into it. Not supposed to get into it. The point is this is real. Ladies and
[57:02.760 --> 57:08.680]  gentlemen, believe me, if you were on the area I'm at and you see what I see, let
[57:08.680 --> 57:11.320]  me tell you it's real and let me tell you it's bad. And you heard the cops
[57:11.320 --> 57:14.520]  yesterday people going, yeah, we do have the military on warrant service. Yeah,
[57:14.520 --> 57:19.920]  that's secret. See, I mean, that's so illegal. Giant covert operations that
[57:19.920 --> 57:26.320]  they're now just phasing out and it goes on provide loudspeaker support that get
[57:26.320 --> 57:29.840]  that video we played two days ready. The video we played two days ago ready worth
[57:29.840 --> 57:34.440]  attention, attention, attention helps the military police commander control
[57:34.440 --> 57:40.320]  detainee and DC populations during emergencies plans and execute psi up
[57:40.320 --> 57:43.800]  program that produces an understanding and appreciation of us policies and
[57:43.800 --> 57:49.600]  actions, which means banker policy inside the US. Our policies bill rights
[57:49.600 --> 57:52.680]  constitution, but you hate that. Remember, this is not restricted to
[57:52.680 --> 57:55.840]  insurgents in Iraq who were detained in prison camps. The manual makes it clear
[57:55.840 --> 57:59.400]  the policies also apply within us territory of the auspices of DHS and
[57:59.400 --> 58:03.360]  FEMA, the historical significance of states using internment camps to
[58:03.360 --> 58:09.080]  reeducate detainees is in fact that it is almost exclusively practiced by
[58:09.080 --> 58:13.800]  repressive and dictatorial regimes like the former Soviet Union and Stalin's
[58:13.800 --> 58:17.840]  regimes like modern day North Korea. Then he goes through how we've
[58:17.840 --> 58:21.960]  documented it all and the other admissions. Ladies and gentlemen, red
[58:21.960 --> 58:31.440]  alert, death con one, maximum alert, maximum alert, maximum, maximum alert. Get

[59:51.720 --> 01:00:00.720]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:12.720]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:21.160]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas. Alex
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.640]  Jones.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:32.200]  Tower number two. We're gonna have open phones and other news during this hour.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:36.520]  Quite frankly, I have trouble covering anything but this. The import of it is
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:42.160]  just gargantuan and staggering. Always informative. One of my mother's
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:46.600]  favorite guests, Gerol Salante, is coming up in the third hour. I want to explain
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:52.160]  something here. If we give in to fear, if it freaks us out as the camps, the
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:59.520]  reeducation, as all of this is exposed and then implement it, the highway
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:03.760]  checkpoints, all of it, if we give in to it and decide to submit to it thinking
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:10.640]  we're gonna be safe, we allow the full tyranny to come in. They've set up their
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.800]  command bases of evil and they're trying to roll it out now, but it's one thing to
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.560]  shut it up. No thing to roll it out. This is the time that tries men's souls.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:23.480]  This is the beginning of the fight, the beginning of all the preparations we've
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:28.440]  made, all the desperate warning and then copying pamphlets and DVDs and
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:34.600]  writinginfoowars.com on the Federal Reserve notes, all of the trench warfare
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:39.480]  in the Info War, all of our psyops of truth up against their mountains of
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:46.720]  sophisticated brainwashing and programming. Truth up against lies. This is
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.840]  it, toe-to-toe with the New World Order, toe-to-toe with people that funded
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:56.280]  Hitler, Stalin, Mao and all the others. It's all just beta test. This is the big
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.800]  attempt to take down the Republic. This is the big enchilada, the big kahuna. This
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:06.080]  is it. This is the beginning. You already see stuff getting wilder by the minute
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:10.880]  and the next four or five years are just going to be insane and if they bring in
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.920]  a Mitt Romney and then have terror attacks, a lot of Americans will go along
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.960]  with this because first they're going to have the army in turn a bunch of
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.440]  disheveled Occupy Wall Street type people and then it'll be some black
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:28.240]  nationals and it'll be some illegals. That was the Rex 84 plan was to roll it
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:34.160]  out that way. See, the expertly get Obama to set up a bunch of it to get the
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.960]  left behind it. Then they bring in a Republican, use it on the left, then bring
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:42.880]  a Democrat back in and I mean this could be a ten-year operation or it could be
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.080]  this year or Obama could set off nukes his controllers could and say domestic
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.560]  groups did it with Al Qaeda. I mean it's all there. They've got different
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:58.640]  scenario attack profiles but just know they always planned to end the fake
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.720]  war on terror against Al Qaeda and say it was for guys wearing John Deere hats
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.600]  and cowboy hats and people that love you know Andy Griffith from Mayberry and
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:13.440]  that's basically what it is now. It's just pale mail, pedal to the metal, bum
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:18.440]  rush, demonization of people that the globalists don't like and that's
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:26.680]  Americans. If you are somebody that the founding fathers would like, if you're
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:31.040]  somebody who just common sense and wants freedom, private property, second
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:38.120]  amendment, men or men, women or women, when cars were fast and weren't
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.800]  poison additives in the food, I mean if you're just a straight up regular guy
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.120]  who isn't a coward, the New World Order sees you as a threat. If you're a
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:53.080]  metrosexual trendy walking around acting like a moron, they love you. Just
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:57.440]  drink your fluoride, eat your GMO, take your vaccines, get a neurological
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.000]  disorder at 40-something, get cancer at 60-something, they can suck all your
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  savings out, you'll never know what hits you, that's who they want. That's who
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.360]  they want and I look at what pus-filled weak vessels the New World Order
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:19.720]  people are, how pathetic they are. Only the fact that good people have a blind
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.960]  spot towards evil is the only reason these guys can attack us. It's like
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:28.800]  we're wearing blinders. Take the stinkin goggles off, take the plugs out of your
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:32.720]  nose and smell the rotten flesh of the New World Order and listen to what's
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:38.520]  being said. Let me tell you, the out-of-control classical comic book
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:46.000]  level tyranny is staring you in the eyes. I mean it's lined up right there.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:54.120]  Not a game, not a joke. It's toe-to-toe with the New World Order, so get the
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.920]  word out while we still have communication systems. Give the number out
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:03.960]  when we come back, stay with us. When you're out on the road, the last place

[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:11.320]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:19.200]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:26.520]  Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Part of the scyop that takes place because our
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:30.800]  military and media is run by foreign enemies of this country, foreign banks,
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.800]  is when the NDAA clearly stated that it would allow the secret arrest of
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:41.240]  Americans, secret torture, secret killing, secret disappearance. The media
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.200]  came out and said it couldn't be true but and then there was a debate about
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.960]  whether or not it was true and then they admitted it was true but Obama said he
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.240]  wouldn't sign it but of course he did. That's another scyop. Tell you it's not
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:57.560]  going to pass so ignorant people will then argue when it does pass and say no
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:05.120]  Obama was against that. Because if you lie it doesn't matter if some people know
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:08.720]  you're lying as long as the general public is ignorant and it confuses
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:12.560]  things because then you make the debate about whether or not the NDAA even
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:18.680]  exist. Now all over the country, started about five years ago, they have TSA
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:23.920]  checkpoints on highways, at bus terminals, trains. They're now going to be at the
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:29.480]  cruise terminals, groping your genitals. It's all an act of domination, total
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:34.360]  federalization, totally illegal, threat fusion center, SWAT teams federalized,
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:39.760]  total control. Then they start hiring every month tens of thousands more
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.520]  domestic internment specialists to be at old military bases and we have the
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.560]  purchase orders and the bid process to to expand these camps and they're like
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:54.360]  okay well there are camps. You know you go to the congressman you say well I got
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:58.440]  the legislation to fund more camps. There's no legislation. Here it is. Oh I
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:03.040]  do remember that now. Oh that's just to help children. Well we saw one of the
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.640]  camps that actually does have playscapes for children. We saw children on it.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.520]  They were probably happy little children though, weren't they? And he talked to
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:15.160]  Ventura like he was a child on that TV show. That's the PSYOP. They go get
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:19.880]  training in this because even if you know they're lying, it still takes it
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:23.480]  back to the fact that they're acting like they don't understand what you're
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.120]  saying to them. Cass Sunstein were like here's your papers where you say you
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:32.080]  know arrest people that disagree with the government. Find them, feed them, outlaw
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:38.920]  it. You know define conspiracy theory as asking questions and not believing
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.240]  known liars and then find us, fee us or arrest us. And Sunstein goes you know I
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:47.520]  don't remember. I've written a lot of papers and starts laughing at him even
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:50.080]  though he wrote him three years ago and it's been all over the news and he's
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.480]  responded to it before. He just smiles and goes I don't know what you're
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:11:00.920]  talking about. And then just smiles at him because there's that denial so that
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:04.920]  there can't be a real debate because he knows people are watching that aren't
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:08.840]  going to go check the information. He's counting on their ignorance and he looks
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:13.320]  at Luke knowingly like going it doesn't matter if you're awake sonny. I'm going
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:18.880]  to get these people. That's the message. It doesn't matter Jones how many documents
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.760]  and pieces of legislation you have and how many camps you've been to. The sheep
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.400]  are going to hear this and they're not going to go check. They're not going to
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.920]  pass this forward on their email list or Facebook or Twitter. They're not going to
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.640]  go to real Alex Jones on Twitter and get our Twitter tweet on this and retweet
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.440]  it. They're just going to go oh yeah camps or even those that do listen are
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:43.160]  just going to repeat it. Well we can break that. I remember being on radio shows
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.320]  for over a decade and going you're the guy that says the gulf of Tonkin to get
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:52.440]  us into Vietnam was staged. Aw conspiracy theorist. Then in 2004 the 40th
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:59.760]  anniversary of 1964 event they declassify that it was all-stage release
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:05.440]  the audio tapes of McNamara telling the president over the phone from DC to
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:12.320]  outside Austin at the LBJ Ranch how they were going to lie to the public and
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.560]  how they would phase it in and get the gulf of Tonkin resolution and the
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:21.640]  president's taken the orders from the former corporate executive who was the
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:27.800]  real president. He's there going to take in his orders. There's always an
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:33.600]  imperial legged in there who really commands the president. In public the
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:43.120]  they says yes sir to the president but not in private not in private and people
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:46.560]  saying why are you talking about this? The point is it was never a conspiracy
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:50.920]  theory the gulf of Tonkin was staged. Good men from those ships who came back
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:55.320]  so we were not attacked it was all a lie including one captain and one first
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:01.320]  mate. They quietly got in trouble. That was in the San Diego Herald Tribune
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.160]  months after the gulf of Tonkin when their ships got back they waited they
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:10.360]  got back they went and told the paper did its job reported it but it became a
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:16.880]  rumor. I had that article I'd had the historians on I'd seen copies of it in
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:25.400]  books I'd gone and checked I knew I knew it wasn't a rumor for me I knew but I
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:29.480]  don't just believe documents I've been to the urban drills I've witnessed them
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:34.120]  trained to put Americans and say it's for America in camps and take your guns
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:43.200]  and take your children away from you and I just read if you just joined us I
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:50.880]  want to hear from police and from active duty military I'd also like to hear
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.200]  from pastors they take you in they tell you you're part of a secret program give
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.480]  you an infraguard card give your church smaller large a little bit of money you
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:03.760]  know a new van some new TVs and now you're part of the faith-based initiative
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.040]  now you're not a church you're not even a charity you're a government front you're
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.720]  you're a collaborator with the bankers and their takeover I don't care if they
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:16.040]  put American flags on the outside of it it's it's it's anti-liberty it's total
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:20.120]  evil and so the preachers and all the rest of them you go to any church this
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:23.480]  weekend it's worship the government do what you're told it's of the Lord I mean
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:29.720]  just unbelievable getting ready for the collapse but the thing is it isn't even
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:32.280]  do what you're told because the government's good and got good people in
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:36.600]  it and we've got an outside threat this is the very bankers imploding our
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:40.800]  society bringing this in so I want to hear because you guys are so cowardly
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:44.760]  especially the preachers that because you know this is classified you've been
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:48.480]  told to talk about it you won't call in about the clergy response team even
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.000]  though I had the documents six years ago and since then there be some newscast
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.680]  on it running psiop we've played those newscast here and the police are so
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:02.560]  scared when they call in even as listeners that I go so you've worked
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:08.040]  with the military and warrant service haven't you well yeah I'm not supposed
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:13.040]  to get into this it's it's everybody folks it's a giant secret program and
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.440]  they've gotten our police that are supposed to be under state charter under
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.240]  the municipal government to be little secret agents and they get off on it
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:25.800]  you know the TV's always whoo CIA who classified like it's rock star status
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:32.080]  it's all fake it's nothing it means being disreputable and traitorous against
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:41.040]  this country you understand that the modern-day CIA you could undoubtedly say
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:45.920]  is a foreign power is a group of mercenaries of a foreign power and
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:52.200]  there's hundreds of thousands of CIA agents officers and millions of their
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.680]  minions in the United States I'd estimate it's at 10 million under direct CIA
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:03.960]  control I mean every dentist my dad knows has been approached to spy on
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.920]  everybody in their office and it's like well what's the spying I don't know not
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:14.040]  paying taxes marijuana pills talking about about the government it's folks
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:17.840]  it is a total stausi state where everybody starts ratting everybody out
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:21.960]  the people get scared they know it's a tyranny so they start going along with a
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.880]  lot of people are going to get really energized and aggressive with this
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.560]  system not because they believe the propaganda but because they're such
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:37.360]  smoking cowards and statistically by the way the system likes to destroy them
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.360]  that's one of their favorite little dishes so those poor idiots have no
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.440]  idea what's about to happen to them
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:49.880]  historically these operatives when they take over respect and fear people like
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:53.960]  myself Ron Paul and others because they know we understand and they're usually
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:58.040]  compartmentalized and get totally freaked out by somebody that decompartmentalizes
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:03.280]  things for them but the country will be destroyed it will totally fall in the
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:07.840]  third world cesspit if this if the globalist have their way this is it this
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:12.440]  if this is it and it's so real it makes my head spin so I want to hear from
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:19.680]  military because I know there's over a hundred thousand of you at least active
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.880]  informer who could be called back up who in the last decade have been phased
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:27.520]  through this civilian inmate labor camp shy off program that I covered in the

[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:00.920]  you're a shameful person if you don't have the will to call in and admit what
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:04.720]  you've done and we already know it but it's good to talk about it to at least
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:13.240]  get you out in the open discussing this and I want to hear from police I mean

[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:18.440]  retired police pastor who should I go to first who's been holding the longest I'll
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:23.760]  try to shut up and go to you guys quick I know you're busy let's go to military
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:29.720]  police David in New Jersey David was this any secret to you this document
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:35.440]  actually Alex not at all to be honest with you I this I've been trying to
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:40.200]  call in for a few weeks I listened to all the time actually got into probably two
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:46.040]  years ago the the weird thing with me is like I had been seeing how the country's
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:52.080]  going in and I came in on the military with like the intention to do good and
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:57.520]  the but I really bothered me how like the whole war on terror turned out to be a
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.520]  whole bunch of garbage I actually experienced while I'm when you're
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:06.520]  talking about the whole a lot of false flag issues regarding I received an
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:11.800]  award for catching two people on terror watch list at a gate and I can provide
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:15.040]  that documentation to you and the thing that really bothered me and what turned
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:19.560]  me on to you was the FBI knew where they were the entire time let them just come
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.000]  right up to the gate and who the hell knows what would have bothered me that
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.240]  they let him in the country with no passport or anything exactly they were
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:30.640]  well that's in the news today where the even mainstream media admits they're
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:36.080]  creating and leading the groups and trying to get them to attack absolutely
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:40.880]  I mean they knew what they ate that day like when it when it came out they were
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:44.800]  held for six hours at our base and when it when it came out six hours later the
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:49.040]  FBI knew what they ate that morning they were in the country with no with no
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:52.200]  passport no identification no nothing and it just so happened that they had a
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:56.840]  dependent that of course they bring them in and of course they sell it oh it's
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:00.640]  for the Muslim extremists no in the training manuals it's for people like
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:05.160]  Charlie Daniels basically so expanding on this what do you make of this
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:11.520]  reeducation camp thing for political dissonance I mean you know that that's
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.800]  been in though that's been in the works for how long I mean no I know but now

[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:15.200]  or ex-army we've got police that have been listing the longest we'll go to Jay
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:20.560]  in California to get his take on this Jay thanks for calling and holding what's
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:25.240]  your view on civilian inmate labor camps and people being arrested for their
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:30.680]  political views and held by the army at concentration camps well I definitely
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:35.880]  think that that there are legitimate issues like india that's legitimate
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:41.000]  policy I think that presidential director 51 is but with regard to this
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.560]  particular document I would like you and or Paul Joseph Watson to point us
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:50.720]  specifically to where this mentions anything about conus because I have
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:56.840]  found this document on an army website army pub dot army dot mill this is not a
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:01.960]  top-secret document and I think it's as restricted again I should just settle
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:05.720]  down you're calling in trying to run a Psy up here on our audience it's
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:08.880]  illegal to have the TSA all over the country doing warrantless checkpoints
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:12.760]  and training police to search bags okay that's been ruled over and over again
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:17.240]  we've got regular military and Marines right where you're out there in
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:22.880]  California in the news running DWI checkpoints 30 miles from base on US
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:27.840]  citizens that's illegal we have got homeland brigade saying they'll pull
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:31.160]  triggers on citizens I've been to countless urban warfare drills and
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:35.560]  you're calling up going your hairs on fire you shouldn't be upset and you
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:41.120]  started out by saying india a is legitimate across the political spectrum
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:45.000]  the entire world even the communist London Guardian said this is
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:52.120]  unprecedented evil the secret arrest of US citizens unbelievable you think PDD
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:57.480]  51 is great I guess so let me guess what type of police officer you and do you
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:01.480]  feel like this is okay because you've been let in to some of it and told the
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:06.880]  Psy op that was crafted for you no no one said this is okay what I'm saying to
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.560]  you is this particular document is not what you're making it out to be and you
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:14.080]  need to tell us specifically where it mentioned the continental United States
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:18.080]  within this document you are misleading your audience like you did before with
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.760]  20 minutes with the president okay I want to hold on one second now that was
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:26.480]  a mock interview with the president that we had a computer glitch for a minute
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:29.600]  the thing went on the bottom that happens it was like 20 pages long look
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:35.000]  I'm trying to find something here where is the article I just read this to people
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.400]  I just read from the document it says it's for in the US we read that part and
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:44.560]  it says identifies malcontents trained agitators political leaders within the
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.680]  facility who may try to organize resistance to create disturbances develops
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:53.840]  and executes indoctrination programs to reduce or remove antagonistic attitudes
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:58.200]  identifies political activists provides loudspeaker support such as
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:01.720]  administrative announcements at facility instructions were necessary helps the
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:05.440]  military police commander control detainee and DC populations during
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:09.680]  emergencies plans and execute Psy op program that produces an understanding
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:13.680]  and appreciation of US policies and actions so you don't deny that this
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:20.280]  doesn't exist you're saying that well I mean what's misleading tell me well what

[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:26.320]  the blue pill if you know what I mean yeah us old timers we've been chased
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:30.760]  off the job you know because we were the kind of people that spoke our minds and
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:35.880]  when I remember sitting in back in 2004 for FEMA training and they started
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:39.720]  talking about George Washington as a terrorist me and a bunch of other guys
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:44.160]  immediately just started just yelling at this guy hey this is a political agenda
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:48.160]  here what are you doing what are you talking about George Washington is a
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:53.360]  terrorist this is ridiculous but half of us got up and left and walked out oh
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:58.800]  let me stop you I was sent by a firefighter 18 hours of footage of FEMA in
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:04.400]  2000 teaching them that the founders are bad America's bad constitutionalist or
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:08.760]  terrorist Ron Paul stickers are bad basically and people saw that footage
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:13.120]  and didn't believe it just like the Mayak at Homeland Security report they
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:16.000]  didn't believe that returning veterans with a number one threat you're saying
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.160]  you were in Washington tell us about that you just retired tell us what they
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:27.320]  told you in 04 this was you know this was you know a political agenda anybody
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:32.840]  would have a brain could see what these bulldoze were dishing out to us and the
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:36.920]  old timers sitting there and there was half old timers and half of these young
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:41.640]  kids that did believe all this garbage they get on TV about what it means to be
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:45.960]  a peace officer as old-timers just started yelling at that the instructor
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:50.640]  tallam hey listen what do you talk this is political agenda here you're I do you
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:54.600]  are you aware you're pushing a political agenda and we were we were outraged we
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:58.560]  were indignant and you know then they started sending people to the fusion
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:05.120]  centers for tours and most of us old timers we didn't get the invitation well
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.080]  of course they want to find out who's a who's an idiot and that's the thing most
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:12.440]  these people that have gotten into this they're into it now and they don't want
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:16.560]  to admit they're wrong they think being a police officer is going out there and
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:20.400]  being a revenue collector okay going out there and writing hard-working people
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:27.080]  tickets for all these ridiculous infraction well the worst part is it
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:31.640]  be one thing of the country was going bankrupt you had to get revenue no
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:35.000]  amount will pay it it's impossible it all goes to foreign banks I'm sorry go
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.440]  ahead well you know we just go back to the 80s back what they started with in
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:44.080]  the 80s with the continuity of government agenda you know and then the
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.720]  police are essential you got a brainwashed the police gotta get the
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:51.640]  police to go along with the program because you can't bring the military in
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:54.480]  right away you got to do it incrementally and this is what they're doing
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.200]  they're doing incrementally you're absolutely right you're hitting it right
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:01.880]  on the head and young man like this guy just called in he's either a fraud or a
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:06.040]  total goof or doesn't have a clue to what's going on in his life well you
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:11.360]  notice he wouldn't say if he works for the military I my gut says he's like a
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:15.920]  deputy liaison to the Pentagon or infregard or FBI because you know they
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:19.160]  do that and give him a little extra money listen buddy you're nothing special

[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:27.600]  never done this before they're building up for a giant offensive against this

[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:13.000]  me frustrated when he said that I get mad I don't want to start screaming at
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.960]  people because I read this morning I stand through it I saw I read Paul's
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:22.760]  article he's counting on you not doing that or he's it's 300 pages long maybe
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:27.600]  he doesn't know what he's reading but you you notice this every time I cover
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:33.720]  something I'm told it isn't real and every once in a while we are wrong and
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:36.920]  I wish I was wrong about this let me explain something I have footage of it
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:41.960]  of them training to take over San Francisco and take people's guns I have
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:50.120]  the Marines admitting it on video I had the Boy Scouts on footage in 1998 now

[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:01.040]  don't bash the Boy Scouts I'm not bashing the Boy Scouts they're being
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:07.080]  taken over I'm not bashing the police I've got family that are police the point
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:13.560]  is I am bashing what it's being turned into that'd be like to use a gross
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:18.000]  analogy it'd be like if somebody used the bathroom defecated on your coat and
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.960]  you put it on with with stuff all over it and I said oh that's disgusting you

[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:38.880]  I would ask him I would say to him okay so but you do do warrant service with
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:44.000]  the military see that's illegal they've kept it secret he feels special doing it
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.640]  I could sit here all day I could take a hundred calls from cops will call in and
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:51.520]  go yeah the military comes to serve warrants with us secretly guys it's
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:57.040]  illegal it's kept secret it's it's not bomb disposal I tell you man this is so
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:01.600]  big Paul and you notice he's like calm down calm down that's the psi op that's
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:05.920]  in the clergy response team calm down go to the camp calm down it's no big deal
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:11.960]  don't get upset calm down listen to NPR you know take some volume go quietly to
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:15.320]  the night get in the car little kid everything's what do you say to him
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:21.960]  Paul well it's it's complete denial and BS basically I don't know whether it's
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:26.680]  the same guy but there's a comment on the article from somebody who says I'm a
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:30.640]  Jag officer with the US Army and basically says that the articles are
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:35.360]  blatant lie to deface the United States Army's character because he claims it's
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:40.920]  just for terrorists in Afghanistan well mr. Jag officer just because of that
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:45.520]  stupid little troll comment I went through the entire document again and
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:49.480]  specifically selected and put them as screenshots on the article where it
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:54.720]  directly says quote these operations maybe be performed as domestic civil
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:57:00.880]  support operations the federal agencies involved in them and our DHS U.A. U.S.
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:05.680]  public health service and let me stop yeah yeah yeah when they fire a psi up at
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:09.760]  us we fire back with truth and crush them they're trying to pass along England to
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:13.760]  secretly arrest you and disappear you forever they're China just passed it
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:18.800]  based on our NDAA they're trying to say they're gonna record everything they
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:22.400]  admit they're doing that here it's illegal these guys are gonna have a lot
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:25.960]  of trouble you know when I'm glad they're still in the psi up of denial
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:29.320]  because that discredits them if they came out and tried to sell it as good
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:34.160]  then it'd be harder to beat them but the fact that they still think we're stupid
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:38.040]  and in the dark you just keep it up you anti-American enemies because you hear
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:41.160]  the other military calling in and most of them are awake and you know that's
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:46.560]  freaking them out isn't it oh without a doubt and I mean here's another quote the
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:51.720]  authority to approve resettlement such operations within U.S. territories again
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:55.960]  within U.S. territories would require special exception to the Posse-Comet
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:59.760]  Arts Act which can be obtained via quote the president invoking his
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:05.000]  executive authority so they're saying we can do all this indoctrination
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:10.160]  just keep adding keep hitting them hard just add just just absolutely and have
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:13.440]  the clergy response team documents and the news admitting they're training us

[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:23.360]  well I tell you Gerald Salente came into this show during a total hornet's nest
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:29.560]  we're gonna get into the economy and a lot more but we will get to Joe Chris
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:37.200]  Anthony Richard and Richard before this hour gets too long in the tooth I wanted
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:40.560]  to get Gerald on about the economy about the new developments about the world
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:44.440]  about all the craziness but Gerald I don't know four or five years ago on the
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:51.200]  show you know trends forecasted social unrest internment as things unravel
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:57.560]  they're gonna clamp down you know as he is saying but in the middle of all this
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:02.360]  we found a leaked document and sure enough the guy did say something true
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:07.080]  earlier that was actually an army website as well this is real leaked US army

[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:33.560]  political dissidents in America and they also use this overseas and it goes on
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:44.160]  and on and on I tell you Gerald from trends research comm they are now
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:48.480]  having TSA that started in Boston in New York all over the country in fact they've
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:51.420]  announced they're coming to Austin to start the groping and they're just at
[02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:54.520]  checkpoints and they do the same thing search your bags start grabbing on you
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:59.160]  I'm done I mean it's not that oh give me tough let the potbelly you know grow
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:04.080]  at the airport I physically can't handle it and especially my children it's the
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:07.680]  because they get off on it it's not like the doctor where they got to look at you
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:11.920]  these people enjoy it I know you travel a lot you've talked about it and now this
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:17.160]  is martial law they are phasing it in the NDAA the secret arrest and I've had a
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:21.440]  lot of police and military call in over 90% are awake yesterday everybody
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:26.040]  agreed today everybody agree but one guy and he calls in saying yeah well some of
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:31.160]  this is going on but so what you know I mean I what do you say to people that
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:34.680]  don't recognize this because you've worked in politics as a consultant you
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:41.440]  know you've done it all a best-selling offer for you know for decades what do
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:45.520]  you say to people who don't know history and don't recognize that we've got
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:52.160]  serious problems what do you say to people like that you know I just return
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:11:00.880]  from Berlin and you know I travel around and to me Berlin before World War two
[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:07.000]  was grander than Paris the boulevards the streets and you know these are the
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.080]  Germans I mean they have you know they have it down as far as engineering style
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:16.360]  culture you know this isn't a third world banana Republic and you see these
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:23.560]  beautiful buildings Alex from the late 1800s early 1900s and then you see in
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:28.920]  between them all new construction from post-World War two and this keeps
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:34.360]  going on everywhere you go these were all bombed out buildings so it's been
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:41.440]  haunting me since I've returned I said to myself these are the Germans how can
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:49.840]  they have let a two-bit little freak like Hitler destroy their entire country
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:55.080]  and then you know you look over to Italy and they had their little freak over
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:12:01.920]  there Mussolini el Duce maybe appropriately el Duce bag and how could
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:08.120]  they have let this guy destroy their country and then you look in America and
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:15.720]  guess what we have our two-bit freaks over here as well oh I'm a political
[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:21.320]  dissident because I don't believe the freaks it's a freak show I look at the
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:26.960]  presidential reality show it's a freak show Obama just pulled off a George
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:32.400]  Bush going to Bagram Air Force Base with that phony little speech of his he
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:36.080]  should have been wearing a codpiece like Bush on the aircraft carrier exactly it
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:41.200]  was the same thing just in a different place and and the people are being led
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:49.200]  by freaks TSA Janet Napolitano hey you make up your own mind if you look up to
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:55.640]  that that's fine to me it's a freak show so what what my dilemma is how do
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:13:02.000]  educated people let their lives be destroyed this isn't just you know a
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:08.400]  philosophical debate we're talking about the destruction of an entire nation
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:16.480]  like Germany that was probably the most at the top of the game in Europe or
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:20.800]  probably the Western world outside the United States that was building up very
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:26.200]  strongly as far as the new nation how could they have been brought down to
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:30.880]  this destruction 15 million people having nowhere to live after World War
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:39.480]  2 ended 15 million how could we continue to fight these wars and let freaks run
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:44.920]  our lives now is the word of the used the word freak too harsh I mean look
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:49.600]  Charlie Chaplin did a great takeoff on Hitler you want to see a little freak
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:55.760]  hey to me anybody that believes George Bush or Obama knock yourself out to me
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:01.400]  it's a freak show it's a freak show for these politicians to go around the
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:07.080]  country hey I'm gonna go down on the form and I'm gonna talk like this and sit
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:13.200]  on a bella hay and I'm gonna talk to the folks I listen to Obama is one of his
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:20.160]  recent speeches he used folks in it about you know 15 times wait a minute
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:24.360]  did you hear Hillary when she goes to different areas she talks in the accent
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:30.360]  so does Rick Perry when she went to Kentucky she went I'm here y'all good to
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:35.280]  say guys pull up Hillary talks with Kentucky accent and it's like even they
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:39.320]  were like what is this you know the most wild-eyed moonshine ring and hillbilly
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:44.960]  didn't talk like that that's the condescension of these people exactly so
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:50.680]  what it is what has happened to the human spirit that here we are watching
[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:56.520]  our nation being destroyed in front of us everyone knows it I mean the TSA this
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:00.560]  is just a show take that they're going to be keep putting more and more pressure
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:05.320]  on us until we have no rights left and by the way that's what the Germans told
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:09.760]  me as well they didn't lose their rights just in one day they were taken away
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:14.440]  from them taken away to the point where if they spoke out they would be taken out
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:20.360]  and the same things happening here well a political dissident I mean what if you
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:23.800]  don't believe in the crap that they're shoving down your throat then you're an
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:28.120]  enemy of the state how you mean when you when you can see through the syndicate
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:32.800]  and call them a bunch of criminals oh then you're a dissident and so what's
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:37.440]  happening here but it again to me and this is what I'm it's going through my
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:43.880]  head since my return what is it in the human spirit that gives the people the
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:48.800]  lack of courage dignity respect and I'll tell you what it is corrupt control
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:53.520]  freaks want power and we'll weasel in and normal people just want to go home be
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:57.080]  with her family and sit there with horror and they are buying five million
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:02.440]  guns a month so people are waking up but I agree with you this is insane and and
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:07.880]  reading this bit of this this document leaked U.S. Army document we found out
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:12.640]  it is on Army sites as well after it was leaked outlines planned for
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:17.440]  reeducation camps in America and it says they're gonna if you criticize the
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:22.400]  government that if you're involved in political activities or you're identified
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:27.000]  as a malcontent trained agitator political leader that you'll be taken
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:32.480]  for reeducation at the camp well look at the cover the trends journal what was
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:37.760]  it is next training to Auschwitz well and the one before that was you as an
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:41.920]  enemy of the state yeah yeah I mean so what we've been saying this we've been
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:46.320]  talking about it it's here in front of us and could you imagine being a
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:50.040]  political not agreeing with the crap that they're shoving down our with
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:54.640]  throats and they and they and all of a sudden you're singled out and taken out
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:59.440]  and where are you it's only going to get worse the financial collapse is
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:04.080]  underway there's no solving the problems in Spain and Italy and Greece in
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:08.680]  England in Ireland in Portugal in Romania in Bulgaria in Hungary in the
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:11.640]  United like you said it's only gonna get worse and now they admit Spain is
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:15.600]  totally collapsing exactly as many of our financial experts you and others
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:20.080]  predicted it went right through Ireland right through Greece right through Italy
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:25.520]  then into Spain Portugal France right through all totally collapsing and the
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:29.680]  bankers demand more when it's not even their money it's their debt yeah and
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:35.600]  then figure this one out how did why do the people have to suffer because of
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:42.000]  what the banks made bad bets by the way up in I I Iceland they you if you
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:47.800]  recall they they were the first company country that went belly up and they
[02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:51.440]  said they had a they had a direct democracy they had a referendum the
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:55.200]  people said no we're not gonna pay the banks they made bad bets all those
[02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:58.680]  people have put the money in the banks and lost it that's their problem the
[02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:04.320]  Danish the English and turned out it 92% of that in that country was a 93 it
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:10.000]  wasn't their debt the media said it was their debt it wasn't exactly so they
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:14.880]  didn't have austerity measures it's not the Spanish debt it's not the American
[02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:20.960]  debt look at that Henry Frankenstein Paulson guy that was the Treasury
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:27.600]  Secretary former CEO of Goldman Sachs gang under the Bush regime that made up
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:32.600]  this whole tarp story that we had to bail out the banks what does everybody
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:39.080]  have ADD they can't remember that one go back to the video tape listen to
[02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:44.280]  Frankenstein Paulson telling the people oh we're going to bail it out because
[02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:51.360]  we're going to save the homeowners that's right that's what he said so what
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:57.720]  this is Alex in pure and simple fashion for anybody that has a brain that's
[02:18:57.720 --> 02:19:05.280]  still working it's called fascism the merger of state and corporate powers the
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:10.520]  money changes and bankers have taken over everybody in the world has to bail
[02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:14.440]  them out so they could keep living in the style that they've been accustomed to

[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:16.600]  Gerald Salente with us for us the hour we're gonna be taking some calls on what
[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:20.080]  his last two trends journals have been talking about going after political
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:23.600]  dissidents but the last one was all these obese people being packed on the
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:27.520]  trains maybe we can go get those graphics we have from the TV show a few
[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:31.440]  weeks ago when he was on and show those for people coming up but we've had a
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:35.880]  real nerve with people in there trying to deny this says it's for domestic
[02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:40.160]  operations when there's hundreds of other documents and this one admitting
[02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:44.920]  it's for domestic operations but that's good it's good that some military people
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:49.360]  are freaking out saying this can't be true what about the NDAA saying we'll
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:53.560]  secretly arrest citizens and disappear them or kill them like with the predator
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:57.720]  drones what about the drones domestically what about all of this all
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:01.760]  this stuff you people denied I saw Homeland Security on C-SPAN say they
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:07.960]  have TSA on the streets of America nine years ago now it's happening oh I was a
[02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:11.760]  fear monger that wasn't gonna happen oh by the way we have the Hillary fake
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:16.880]  Kentucky voice this is real from when she was running against Obama in 2008
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:20.360]  here it is I don't feel no way he's tired
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:29.240]  I come too far from where I started from nobody told me that the road would be
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:33.080]  easy I don't believe he brought me this
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:40.400]  that's enough you think I'm joking and and I've had I heard Rick Perry speaking
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:43.520]  to Hispanic groups in California's room for president and I would be so
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:50.040]  insulted because he was going hello good to see you he wasn't speaking Spanish
[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:55.680]  he was going I've got some family that does that we'll be in a Mexican restaurant
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:26:01.200]  they'll go I would like taco I mean it's so condescending is that what you were
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:04.840]  talking it'd be like Gerald if I went to an Italian restaurant and said hello
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:10.000]  Luigi or like some kind of fake Italian accent oh mama Mia or be like if you went
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:13.840]  you know into say some east Texas people's restaurant we're like how you
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:17.880]  doing there boy won't you bring me a chicken fried steak I mean it's so
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:22.120]  condescending is that what you were talking about well yes and in the sense
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:27.400]  that it's a freak show that's all it is these are freaks only a freak would
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:33.680]  behave no no hey wait a minute wait a minute she's the secretary of state she
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:39.400]  was a presidential candidate and a former first lady I could become a
[02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:43.520]  political dissident for calling a freak a freak because only a freak would
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:49.320]  behave like that my estimation the crowd appeared to love it they were all
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:55.240]  applauding like little children and that goes back to what I was saying how
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:27:02.680]  could a civilized society like Germany you know the top engineers in the world
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:11.640]  this beautiful country be taken over and bow down to and suck up and follow a
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:18.440]  two-bit freak like Hitler how could Italy have done it how does America do
[02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:25.960]  it the people keep applauding they applauded that cheap act they
[02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:32.800]  applaud let me read you this you want to see a part of a freak show and a guy that
[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:41.240]  applauded Chris Matthews host of NFS MSNBC's hardball how about softball
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:47.560]  raved about President Obama's speech made to American troops during his
[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:53.480]  surprise visit to Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan oh and you go back to the
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:28:00.160]  speech and President Obama says how close to our heart Bagram Air Force
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:05.720]  bases I'm sure everybody out there listening it's so close to your heart
[02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:11.200]  and you could find it you know on a map and put a pin on it anyway quote I
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:19.520]  imagine being a soldier over there this is what you want to hear Matthews said
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:24.280]  imagine being a soldier over there what is this clown playing the soldiers most
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:27.760]  of them say they want to come home the guy that killed all those people begged
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:31.360]  not to be sent back for a fourth time as part of his foot have been blown off but
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:35.000]  they always imply let's support the troops and everybody knows what they
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:40.200]  want the war to continue and to be sent in for a seventh tour that's what they
[02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:44.920]  really want that's what that movie heartlocker said that's not true so here
[02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:50.880]  you have this little altar boy Chris Matthews I imagine being a soldier over
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:55.360]  there what are you six years old you can't imagine this you have no idea what
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:29:00.280]  it's like but this is the kind of prostitute you know that's such great
[02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:09.000]  stuff I was so proud of the president I must say I mean come on this is what it
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:14.320]  is so these are the prostitutes leading the people to war and again I keep going
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:19.720]  back to the premise how could people buy this cheap freak show well by the way
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:22.360]  it is a freak show let's say if I came up to New York to see it like I've done
[02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:26.760]  and if we were at dinner and I started doing a New York accent you would think
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:30.240]  I was a freak or if you came down to Texas to visit me do you get here and

[02:31:20.440 --> 02:31:24.720]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:28.880]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:33.200]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:31:33.200 --> 02:31:36.880]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[02:33:07.560 --> 02:33:13.560]  all I want is my due process in my country back but General Motors paid
[02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:20.480]  what was it total $22 billion to ship the vault plants the Cadillac plants and
[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:25.880]  some of their other car manufacturing to China Brazil Eastern Europe and
[02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:30.840]  Mexico so you paid in the bailout money your tax money to ship it out of the
[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:35.480]  country and they just announced it if those aren't traders because it's one
[02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:38.600]  thing of companies want to leave you know we should have tariffs that are
[02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:42.400]  fair of course we don't shouldn't have tax incentives no there's a reason
[02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:46.160]  everything left the country because we have traders running the nation the
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:50.120]  stories up at drudgereport.com it's our report from info wars.com Rand Paul
[02:33:50.120 --> 02:33:55.040]  launches campaign to end the TSA very important we need to all get behind that
[02:33:55.040 --> 02:33:57.920]  I got a lot of other news I want to go over with Gerald Salente and also ask
[02:33:57.920 --> 02:34:03.880]  what's on his radar screen but biggest news in a long time here confirming what
[02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:07.160]  we already knew I mean they're saying the president wants a law to secretly
[02:34:07.160 --> 02:34:11.600]  disappear you and then people are like oh I didn't say that yet does the
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:16.840]  president says and he's not going to sign it but he did sign it and then he
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:22.480]  wasn't going to use it but now he says I may and they're training the police to
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:26.800]  do this type of stuff and so you've got to admit the system is bad stop living
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:30.480]  in denial we got to go back the other direction not live in denial and go
[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:35.520]  deeper into this leaked US Army document outlines plan to reeducation camps in
[02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:40.760]  America political activists would be pacified to sympathize with the
[02:34:40.760 --> 02:34:45.200]  government and it's an amazing article with the PDF and the screenshots
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:49.480]  highlighted where it says it's for the American people domestically over and
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:54.480]  over again and again I've been to the drills they're training the military to
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:58.720]  take us on so the minority of people are there on the article at info wars.com
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:04.560]  denying that it says that oh they like the NDAA and the Patriot Act and all of
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:09.680]  it Gerald Salente again is our guest let's talk to Anthony in California who's
[02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:18.040]  got a comment on this Anthony. Hey how you doing Alex? Good. I'm not actually
[02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:24.320]  military myself but I did work alongside with a lot of military people and I've
[02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:26.960]  got to talk to some of them who've been on multiple tours like you were just
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:32.400]  staying there who knows what really you know what's really going on and if I
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:37.640]  could get in a couple of things if I may the first is that well you've helped
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:41.120]  awaken me and I talked to a lot of these guys I used to have a security job that
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:45.200]  hired a lot of them on and off duty one person in particular was an active duty
[02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:49.640]  soldier who returned from Iraq who's now deployed in Afghanistan around the time
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:54.320]  Bin Laden's supposed death when all those contracts were placed in the returning
[02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:59.520]  soldiers we talked about Dr. Steve Buchanick's information he brought up
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:04.240]  one of his best friends in the Navy was actually on the ship that was carrying
[02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:09.640]  Bin Laden's body and said that nothing was actually dropped into the water no
[02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:14.360]  real body was dropped into the water. Well you know they had the biggest
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:18.920]  discipline in decades of that ship was 80 plus people they claimed were smoking
[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:23.600]  marijuana and disarmably discharged him and the intel we got was is that was a
[02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:28.080]  cover-up let me ask Gerald Salente of trendsresearch.com or trendsjournal.com
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:32.440]  what's your take on the Bin Laden thing I mean the seals have come out and said
[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:37.000]  stop acting like a hero stop using us as ammunition for your reelection campaign
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:41.880]  and the media is like wow he's a hero Bill Clinton runs ads saying he's a hero
[02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:46.080]  because he made the hard decision meanwhile the Navy Seal helicopter blew
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:49.920]  up that they supposedly put the body on that's the way to say you got him to have
[02:36:49.920 --> 02:36:54.560]  the helicopter fly out land take off blow up the other seals speak out their
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:59.320]  helicopter blows up 25 of them or whatever die then it turns out they were
[02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:02.880]  going to save Rangers that wasn't true I mean I guess we're just supposed to
[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:08.000]  believe all this Gerald we did a whole trends journal on it when it when it
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:13.800]  happened and we said that if this was a Hollywood movie it would have been panned
[02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:19.440]  by the critics it was one lie after another we have it in detail and I'm
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:24.640]  going to send it to you we wrote about it as it happened and all of the back
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:30.480]  tracks and lies like you remember that famous photo when all of you know there
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:36.040]  was Biden and Hillary Clinton and they're all intent looking at the so-called
[02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:41.200]  video of this thing taking place live and we find out that's not really what
[02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:47.280]  happened at all it was one lie after another the lies are always there Alex
[02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:51.720]  you remember the Gulf of Tonkin incident that started the Vietnam War that
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:57.120]  never happened I'm sure we've all seen over and over those massive amounts of
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:02.520]  photos of weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda that never happened
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:09.000]  and it's the same thing with this whole situation with Ben Laden it was one big
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:14.200]  lie the story kept falling apart and they kept changing it and what I'm going
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:18.520]  to do is we're going to email you that trends journal where it's all outlined
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:23.440]  in chapter and verse from last year and it was your and that was the beginning
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:30.800]  by the way of Obama's meteoric rise from the slumps of his campaign if you go
[02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:35.720]  back to that time you remember that Donald Trump was going after him oh and
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:41.520]  oddly enough do you know when they when he did that May 1st following the big
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:48.800]  prostitute dinner when making jokes and all these lame jokes sorry by last oh yeah
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:53.960]  that's the day he did it he was getting bombed by Trump and then all of a sudden
[02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:59.720]  Obama ran his ratings went to 60% following up on that little
[02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:05.760]  prostitute that altar boy over there Chris Matthews this is what he said
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:11.320]  congressman Moran Democratic Virginia I was so proud of him because I am
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:16.480]  imagine being a soldier over there this is what you want to hear the troops are
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:23.160]  backed up by the people at home and there you have your commander-in-chief there
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:29.200]  with you personally it's great stuff Matthews said quote he is now a
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:35.320]  commander-in-chief and not just by claiming to be but by acting as
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:42.280]  commander-in-chief should act this was a commander-in-chief speech it was not
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:48.360]  political it was motivational it was exactly what the troops needed to hear
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:53.880]  and just as important what their families need to hear back home
[02:39:53.880 --> 02:40:00.760]  Moran said Moran said how about moron said you know and you know this is
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:05.640]  another tough guy you know this guy was doing during the Vietnam War he was on
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:13.480]  a sports scholarship all of these guys talking tough what I feel like if I was
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:18.880]  over there and these guys have never fought a day in their lives oh and this
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:26.200]  is what we want to hear don't tell me what we want to hear tell me what you
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:32.720]  like exactly most most poll show upwards of 80% we've wanted us out of
[02:40:32.720 --> 02:40:36.600]  Afghanistan for years and they just sit there and say this is what the people
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:40.240]  want to hear if you like you went to a restaurant and they brought out a bucket
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:43.680]  of horse manure and said this is the steak you ordered and I'm like no that's

[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:54.960]  squad supposedly that killed the modern was called a red squad and a third thing

[02:42:07.160 --> 02:42:10.800]  journalism and I did submit a video for the reporter contest I haven't seen
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:13.720]  posted yet I hope you get to it if not there are a lot of great submissions
[02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:17.240]  sir we are trying to get it all posted but we want to dull it out because we
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:21.560]  don't we put more than 15 out a day then people won't watch him we do plan to
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:24.200]  start doling some out and actually airing them on air but God bless you
[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:28.440]  yeah look all the military I've talked to doesn't buy this and I talked to an
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:32.800]  AV seal here in Austin who I've known for years I'll just leave it at that and
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:39.680]  his family's here and he has a friend in still team six and he said they don't buy
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:46.000]  it and he said yeah they think they were sabotaged in that helicopter that had
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:49.920]  20-plus on board that died and it was a fake mission it was on the news they
[02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:55.840]  were battling Al Qaeda saving the Rangers turned out it wasn't even a real
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:59.680]  mission they just put them on flew them out it blew up and the media had to
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:03.920]  admit that was it true same thing with Pat Tillman he was charging an Al Qaeda
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:08.440]  bomb and placement machine guns got taken out of course turned out they killed
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:12.720]  him the army coroner said they murdered him so the good news is everybody's not
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:18.240]  lying Gerald but I mean look at that the Pat Tillman all of it how about that
[02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:23.800]  other one that young girl in Iraq remember that one privately yeah I mean
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:27.280]  they keep making this stuff up here's that trends journal by the way the
[02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:32.720]  direct democracy issue and this is from the summer of 2011 and here's the quote
[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:38.080]  I said is cinema showing a Hollywood B movie as incoherent and unconvincing as
[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:45.680]  Obama versus Osama would be merciless mercilessly mercilessly panned by film
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:51.760]  critics here we get here's the story right here it began with this great
[02:43:51.760 --> 02:44:00.160]  Obama watch bin Laden die on live video and shoot out beam to White House there
[02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:03.600]  it is it's right there they tell the whole story by the next day the script
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:09.060]  that was already beginning to change there was no firefight no one fired on
[02:44:09.060 --> 02:44:15.880]  Navy SEALs in bin Laden's house only one of Osama's associates was armed and he
[02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:20.640]  was killed in an adjacent guest house at the start of the Iraq even believe
[02:44:20.640 --> 02:44:26.200]  that then they dump him in the water remember this one and an unarmed Osama
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:32.600]  did not use his wife as a human shield like the prostitute said they did like
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:37.880]  the White House lie that they did what was first described it is an elaborate
[02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:43.680]  fortified million dollar compound was neither elaborate nor fortified one lie
[02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:50.640]  after the next we outline every one of them and yet here it is the whole thing
[02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:58.680]  has been recast and you have guys like that moron moran and that prostitute
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:03.920]  Matthew's saluting our commander-in-chief let me tell you what I believe a
[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:09.840]  commander-in-chief is you want to call yourself a commander-in-chief Chaco go
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:16.680]  lead the troops go command chief stop shooting off your mouth like you're a
[02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:23.600]  tough guy and go over there with the soldiers live with them and go lead the
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:30.560]  charge and by the way that I include everyone else in that anyone that wants
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:37.120]  to talk tough and be tough pack up your gear and go fight leave me out of your
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:42.200]  psychotrip well that's it and I hear these guys that call in and say parking
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:46.320]  lot kill them all they can't even find the country I mean I reacted nothing to
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:53.120]  us our government puts an arm in power this is the reality of this now Gerald
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:56.920]  expanding on this is I want to go back to some more phone calls but but but
[02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:00.480]  looking at the election landscape seeing where this is all going Mittens
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:05.880]  Romney Barack Obama all the rest of it what are you forecasting in the election
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:11.960]  well what we forecast back on October 3rd our trend alert Obama wins again and
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:16.720]  that's the way we see it at this point you have all the Obama apologists you
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:21.960]  could go down the line of all the backtracks that he's done and they keep
[02:46:21.960 --> 02:46:27.960]  saying oh I like Obama oh you know he tried and he just can't get anything
[02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:33.760]  done and and and you give him one live one backtrack after another and they
[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:39.520]  just dismiss it so Romney you know Romney as we said in that trend alert way
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:44.840]  back when was when it comes to the only when it comes to health care for example
[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:50.000]  they're not going to be able to use that one because he has his Romney care so we
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:55.080]  see Obama winning again and and that's the way it's going to shape up as we see
[02:46:55.080 --> 02:47:02.360]  it at this point oh boy let's take a call from Joe and then Chris Joe in
[02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:07.480]  Texas former army has a take he wants to give us Gerald on the political
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:13.680]  dissidents to be sent to reeducation camp document at info wars.com
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:22.200]  Joe what's your take on this it's like it's like the song by
[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:29.040]  what's the name hey Joe let's go and Dr. Chris in Maryland former army give us
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:34.040]  his take on this Chris go ahead hey Alex how you doing good thanks for holding
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:39.640]  what's on your mind this thing about the indoctrination of soldiers if you
[02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:44.280]  remember Panetta recently in front of Congress or rather recent and made the
[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:48.480]  statement that the president and the military takes the orders from the
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:54.160]  United Nations I just wanted to share something with you that I know firsthand
[02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:59.640]  because I was back in during the time of Camp Abel sentry when we were sent to
[02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:05.480]  the United Nations mission in Macedonia and at that time there was a guy I'm not
[02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:09.480]  sure if you remember him his name was specialist knew he refused to go on
[02:48:09.480 --> 02:48:15.160]  orders to go to Camp Abel sentry because he said I served I sworn off to the
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:19.920]  United States not a foreign power but yet no no we've had Michael knew on his
[02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:24.320]  dad many times he was gonna go under you in command and this document talks
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:30.440]  about our trips being under you in command exactly and before we were in the
[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:35.880]  group before him he went in during sometime in October of 95 and I was in
[02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:42.520]  there November 94 till about June 95 roughly but the whole thing of this
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:47.720]  it's just incredible there I really don't think our military is gonna come
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:51.720]  against the people what I think's gonna happen is is the military knows that they
[02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:55.680]  got their families out there in trouble and what'll happen is is they're gonna
[02:48:55.680 --> 02:48:59.520]  turn the guns on their masters but what's gonna happen is like you said
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:04.200]  we've got foreign national troops within the United States and then we're gonna
[02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:08.200]  have United Nations troops coming in and it's gonna be a big war like you were
[02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:14.800]  saying earlier just a fat war death blood everything everywhere a fat war
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:18.000]  that's a good word for it thank you sir God bless you look at this headline
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:22.760]  Gerald Los Angeles Times Obama's a bigger hero been lot and ordered squads
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:27.520]  to try to attack Obama's aircraft in mid 2010 that's like Hillary when she got
[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:31.240]  caught lying saying she was under fire in Bosnia and it turned out it was all a
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:36.560]  lie they're always telling us they're such heroes Gerald I know isn't it
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:41.360]  something oh how about Obama's new story about that you know his girlfriend that
[02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:47.200]  never existed that that's being you know that he told this whole story in his
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:52.680]  book if it while it was at a composite yeah how about a lie you know that's all
[02:49:52.680 --> 02:49:55.880]  they do and that's what historians that have seen that have said it's like the
[02:49:55.880 --> 02:50:00.120]  whole thing's just fake it's like we don't even know who he is again as I
[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:07.560]  said you go back I I'm still it's on my mind continually about seeing Berlin and
[02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:11.720]  seeing this beautiful city and the amount of destruction that had happened to it
[02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:16.440]  and it wasn't only Berlin it was Hamburg was Dresden obviously and on and on and
[02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:22.400]  you could say when did why didn't the people say stop how could you do this to
[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:28.200]  us but yet they believe the baloney and they believe it in here hey look Alex
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:33.480]  Kim Kardashian just got a 40 million dollar contract what more can I say
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:38.240]  about living in this country and what's going on and by the way I understand
[02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:42.240]  from a lot of people I and people I know in the media and other people that are
[02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:47.320]  leaving the country and people are asking me am I afraid to stay and when am I
[02:50:47.320 --> 02:50:52.520]  going to leave after coming back from Berlin I decided hold on stay there I
[02:50:52.520 --> 02:50:56.040]  want to hear this this is big I don't even know what he's about to say it's a
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:50:59.620]  cliffhanger we'll be right back at the concentration camp article at info
[02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:05.480]  wars.com a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why

[02:51:08.960 --> 02:51:13.280]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[02:51:13.280 --> 02:51:16.680]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[02:51:16.680 --> 02:51:21.240]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace

[02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:29.840]  been talking to a number of people I'm sure you've heard their names as well
[02:54:29.840 --> 02:54:33.320]  that are leaving the country and people have asked me not to say who they are as
[02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:40.320]  well and after coming back from Berlin I decided I'm staying I'm not gonna let
[02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:47.680]  some too big dictator throw me out me too exactly I like it and and if Obama or

[02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:56.200]  and they say it because they don't trust the government what do you think that
[02:55:56.200 --> 02:56:02.040]  message is well again you you just said it it's a criminal operation and
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:07.920]  anybody that supports this criminal operation that doesn't talk out against
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:15.240]  this criminal operation to me is an accessory to the crime well yes sir they
[02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:22.840]  are collaborators everybody that supports the TSA everybody that supports the bombings
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:29.640]  everybody that supports the drone attacks everybody that supports the bailouts
[02:56:29.640 --> 02:56:37.320]  everybody that supports the Republican and Democratic syndicate to me are
[02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:43.480]  accessories to the crime you're the ones that should leave you're the ones that
[02:56:43.480 --> 02:56:48.440]  are disgrace in my eyes they are the collaborators and when we get this

[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:15.680]  reporting the orders well you know the New World Order that's what really is
[02:57:15.680 --> 02:57:18.440]  amazing they got all these chicken-necked New World Order people who
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:22.720]  really have never been a fistfight probably and they really think they're
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:26.160]  just gonna mess up a bunch of black uniforms and tanks and everybody's
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:30.560]  scared and let me tell you people aren't scared they're very sad but they're

[02:57:58.680 --> 02:58:05.920]  bleeding-heart liberals that was screaming and screeching when George Bush

[02:58:16.520 --> 02:58:21.640]  the way how about why isn't it making all of the news that they've been lying

[02:59:57.720 --> 03:00:00.880]  Broadcasting Network
[03:00:10.880 --> 03:00:17.040]  speaking of mind-controlled top story at info wars.com leak US Army document
[03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:21.960]  outlines plan for education camps in America this is just off the charts
[03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:25.200]  news and it's just it's one of the biggest things we've ever reported on
[03:00:25.200 --> 03:00:31.520]  here's the Attorney General on C-SPAN bragging how he met with media heads to
[03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:35.640]  brainwash and demonize the Second Amendment here's a short clip of that
[03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:39.680]  we'll get Gerald's take on it in closing with our interview with him here it is
[03:00:39.680 --> 03:00:43.760]  every level one thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults
[03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:47.480]  as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this it's not enough to
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:51.880]  simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday we need to
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:56.040]  do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[03:00:56.040 --> 03:01:01.200]  about guns in a vastly different way we also want to have a hotline that we will
[03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:05.520]  set up and that's enough he goes into a title-tell line of yours money's house
[03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:08.800]  and see a gun even it's legal call the police and what do they say they say they
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:14.120]  will brainwash and reeducate you at these camps Gerald can you imagine if we
[03:01:14.120 --> 03:01:16.720]  were in one of these camps and of course what they'll do is take us and beat the
[03:01:16.720 --> 03:01:20.280]  daylights out of us and torturers and stuff and I guess scare everybody else
[03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:27.160]  into taking on some type of you know syndrome where you love your abusers
[03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:32.400]  what's that called Stockholm syndrome yeah this country has Stockholm yeah and
[03:01:32.400 --> 03:01:39.920]  and big bro over there he's also put guidelines in let anyone forget that
[03:01:39.920 --> 03:01:44.840]  they're listening to us now and what they're also doing every stroke of your
[03:01:44.840 --> 03:01:49.280]  keyboard every cell phone call that you make every place that you're on
[03:01:49.280 --> 03:01:54.320]  surveillance camera they're now putting in algorithms to decide whether or not
[03:01:54.320 --> 03:01:59.360]  you're an enemy of the state and when you really think about this is that if
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:05.760]  you don't believe their BS then you have no place in America with a K and so this
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:12.120]  Orwell had never dreamt of what would have happened as it's happening now by
[03:02:12.120 --> 03:02:16.480]  the way it's illegal for them to spy on us not warrants and they just admit it
[03:02:16.480 --> 03:02:20.120]  they have dropped their pants in front of us and they're telling us they're
[03:02:20.120 --> 03:02:24.920]  gonna rape us exactly and yet one of the other ones Alex that we haven't
[03:02:24.920 --> 03:02:29.440]  mentioned was at seven o'clock on a Friday and this is important because the
[03:02:29.440 --> 03:02:33.480]  government what they do when they have to release information that they don't
[03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:38.240]  want anybody to know they do it late on Friday after the news media is out of
[03:02:38.240 --> 03:02:42.600]  the Capitol and they do this worldwide and Saturday is the least watched in
[03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:48.080]  Red Newsday Obama also signed that wonderful executive order that gives
[03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:53.280]  El Presidente of Los Estados Unidos they say that because we're a banana
[03:02:53.280 --> 03:02:59.680]  republic now the full right to take over farms factories businesses banking
[03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:07.360]  everything under quote a potential threat so when you look at what's happened
[03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:11.760]  to this country and you listen to a brainwash tape like that coming from
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:16.680]  Holder oh by the way you know this Eric Holder is he's the same guy that was
[03:03:16.680 --> 03:03:20.840]  under Clinton yeah that's right that when Clinton was signing all those
[03:03:20.840 --> 03:03:25.560]  pardons and remember the guy that what was his name over in Switzerland that
[03:03:25.560 --> 03:03:30.320]  gave Clinton tons of money to run for campaign Holder squeaked that one
[03:03:30.320 --> 03:03:35.400]  through that's the high caliber people that we're talking about crooks and
[03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:40.440]  criminals in high places they're the best ones to be attorney generals oh and
[03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:44.440]  by the way talking about crooks and criminals in high places we just saw
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:49.560]  another report coming out that John the Slime Corzine you know the former CEO of
[03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:54.320]  Goldman Sachs Treasury excuse me senator and governor of New Jersey and
[03:03:54.320 --> 03:04:02.000]  raper of our funds out of the MF global scam he's been bundling even more money
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:08.280]  than they even anticipated for Obama so it's one big crime syndicate and
[03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:15.040]  anybody again in my estimation that supports the syndicate is an accessory
[03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:19.960]  to the crime or as you would say a collaborator and we're not just saying
[03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:24.280]  that we've come to this point instead of them lecturing us it's like hey you're
[03:04:24.280 --> 03:04:27.840]  now saying the war on terror is over but the TSA's got a gropus on the streets
[03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:32.680]  that we're the enemy you're the enemy I mean it's that simple they are the
[03:04:32.680 --> 03:04:38.480]  enemy Gerald Solente I'm glad to hear that you're gonna be staying here it's
[03:04:38.480 --> 03:04:43.960]  our country it's not the foreign bankers they're the criminals and we are gonna
[03:04:43.960 --> 03:04:47.600]  beat them we're not just gonna stand and fight we're gonna beat them I feel it I
[03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:51.840]  know it this country is waking up God bless you my friends extra spending time
