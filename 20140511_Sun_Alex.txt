[00:00.000 --> 00:14.000]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones
[00:14.000 --> 00:22.000]  It's the time of the season When the love run was high
[00:22.000 --> 00:27.000]  In this time Give it to me easy
[00:27.000 --> 00:36.000]  My friends, we are L.I.V.E. live on this 11th day
[00:36.000 --> 00:43.000]  11th day of May 2014
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  When we're not live, once a month or so, you will hear me say it's an original transmission
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  because I will tape a whole show or part of a show for you on either Friday night or Saturday
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  out of town or busy with family stuff, like on Easter
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  But we are live, and we're also live, not just Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. central
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  But back weekdays, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.000]  And when that broadcast, when I'm not there, it's David Knight sitting in doing a fabulous job
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  doing a great job Friday with the crew
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.000]  One of the best crews out there
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  We are not just mainstream media as a killer, we are the antidote to the New World Order
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  And so are you, we the people
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.000]  All right, I got so excited when I saw this yesterday because I've been following it
[01:31.000 --> 01:39.000]  that I shot a video that's up on infowars.com
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  But I talk about certain things being a skeleton key or a rosetta stone
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  And what is a skeleton key or a rosetta stone?
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.000]  A rosetta stone is the key to decipher the meaning of ancient hieroglyphics
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  What was it, in that case, was it Egypt or Babylon, I forget
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  Let's pull up the rosetta stone for me, thanks
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  And when they found that decoder template carved on a black rock
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  They could suddenly unlock many of the ancient mysteries
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  And it's the same thing with a skeleton key, it's the key in a hotel
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  Or a business that will open all the locks, not just the one office
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  I have a key for here at the office that opens all the doors
[02:24.000 --> 02:31.000]  What's happened in Mexico is a rosetta stone is a skeleton key
[02:31.000 --> 02:39.000]  And I'm going to come back and cover it, it's a positive rosetta stone key
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  It's a brush fire that if wind hits it, and if we fan the flames, we'll burn down tyranny
[02:44.000 --> 02:52.000]  And create a verdant system of low crime and just luxurious freedom worldwide
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.000]  And a return to chivalry, to knighthood, to people not smart enough
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  And having to, you know, not cash checks at their mouth rights
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  This is so important
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.000]  There's also very poisonous rosetta stones and skeleton keys
[03:10.000 --> 03:16.000]  Or just things that really make things clear what's going on
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.000]  And the Pope coming out, I want to talk about this more today, earlier in the week
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  I guess on Thursday night and saying we need wealth redistribution
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  You guys reprint me or repull those articles from Friday and Thursday
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.000]  I want to get these quotes exactly right
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  That's a big deal to say we should have wealth redistribution
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  Because that's stealing, thou shalt not steal
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  And you can always argue the wealth's for the poor, it's for the best interest
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  It always turns into a monstrous tyranny
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  And the elite are the ones pushing this because they get the money
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  And then hand out chicken feed to the public
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  So we're going to be covering that coming up as well today
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  But I'm going to try to be calm, this is so monumental
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  What's happening in Mexico
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  From every angle it's the key and I salute the people of Mexico
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  Mexico to legitimize vigilantes fighting drug cartel
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  That's the AP
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  And it goes on from there
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  Mexican vigilantes keep arms despite deadline
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  Strange, AP changed that headline, it was different last night
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  Mexico to transform anti-cartel vigilante forces
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  But when you really read what's happening
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  They just won't turn their guns in
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  And they've stopped the crime and cut it down to nothing
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  And all the areas they're operating, which is now spreading
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  And Mexicans just aren't following the government
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  Because they know it's really the drug cartels
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  Different arms of the government fighting through different arms of cartels
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  I'll break it all down, this is so big
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  The Second Amendment is coming to Mexico
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  They hit the bottom, now they're coming back up
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  And then concentrated or maximum potency
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  Supermill vitality was developed
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  To activate your body's own natural processes

[05:56.000 --> 06:24.000]  InfoWarsLife.com
[06:24.000 --> 06:26.000]  There is a war
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  It's happening now
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  It will decide the fate of humanity
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  The time to choose sides has come
[06:33.000 --> 06:35.000]  We are the resistance
[06:35.000 --> 06:38.000]  We are the InfoWars
[06:41.000 --> 06:43.000]  You are the InfoWars
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  You the people have the power
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  You are the Renaissance
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  You historically have been the
[06:50.000 --> 06:54.000]  Common folks like myself who change history for the better
[06:54.000 --> 06:58.000]  Or the knowledge, the wisdom of the crowd
[06:58.000 --> 07:01.000]  That historically is always better than that
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  Of the Waldorf establishment
[07:03.000 --> 07:07.000]  There was a book I read more than a decade ago
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  Small is beautiful, I think was the name of it
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  Written by a professor, it was a short little book
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  About how the best restaurants are small mom and pops
[07:15.000 --> 07:22.000]  The best facilities, the best art, the best literature
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  It's produced lovingly
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  It's decentralized
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  Small is beautiful, a study of economics
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  As if people mattered
[07:32.000 --> 07:35.000]  There's a collection of essays by British economist
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  E.F. Schmucker
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  Schumacher, the phrase small is beautiful came from a phrase
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  By his teacher, Leopold Core
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.000]  And is often used to champion small, appropriate technologies
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  That are believed to empower people more
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  In contrast with the phrase such as bigger is better
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  First published in 73, Small is Beautiful brought
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  His critiques of Western economics to a wider audience
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  During the 73 energy crisis
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  An emergence of globalization
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.000]  So it was a big critic of globalization
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  The Times literary supplement ranked small as beautiful
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.000]  Among the 100 most influential books published since World War II
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  A further addition was, which commemorates its first publishing
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  Was published in 99
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  But let's just stop right there, I didn't mean to digress off into that
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.000]  The point is the people are the answer
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  Local government's the answer
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  Decentralization is the answer
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  Now the globalists always create clones of whatever's common sense
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  They say they don't want any local government control
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  Or even state or federal
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  They want international, unelected secret corporate boards
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  That's the new world order
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  That dictate through unelected trade federations what to do
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  They have the Trans-Pacific Partnership right now
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  Six months ago it got leaked
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  The open documents which they admit are real
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  Obama was very upset about it
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  That would end the free internet in that neutrality
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  As much as we know it
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  Basically the communist Chinese government wrote it
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  That's an example of how we're debating is the federal government tyrannical
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  And it's already been signed over via treaties
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000]  To the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the globalists
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  And so we can debate, are we Republican, are we Democrat, are we Black, are we White, are we Hispanic, are you Asian
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  It doesn't matter
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  It's what is the content and character of your deeds, as Martin Luther King said
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  You stand for, well I stand for individual rights, individual liberty
[09:38.000 --> 09:42.000]  I trust the general public to be armed
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.000]  A hundred times more than I trust a big centralized government to be armed
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  And then I could talk for ten hours
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.000]  And show you historical examples of how centralized government
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  Is the most dangerous thing historically
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  In the 20th century university of Hawaii, pull it up
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.000]  The term democide was coined more than 15 years ago by a top professor
[10:06.000 --> 10:10.000]  Other Chicago business schools done an analysis that was similar
[10:10.000 --> 10:17.000]  But the point is government killed between 260 million and 300 and plus million
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  Depending on which study you look at
[10:19.000 --> 10:26.000]  The low number is 262 million university of Hawaii, democide, or death by government
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  That's not wars, that's non-military combatants
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  Being women and children, being put in death camps, being shot in the back of the head
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  Being raped, being starved, being killed, being forced labored
[10:37.000 --> 10:44.000]  Government, government is the number one unnatural killer
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  It's cancer, heart attacks, and then it's government
[10:48.000 --> 10:56.000]  Then it's flesh eating bacteria and hospital complications caused by the hospital
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  And then you go down the line, then it's suicide
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  That wasn't even the top ten 20-something years ago, now it's in the top ten
[11:03.000 --> 11:09.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to get into something so exciting
[11:09.000 --> 11:15.000]  That I describe it as a skeleton key or a rosetta stone of understanding
[11:15.000 --> 11:20.000]  And again, certain stories, certain narratives, certain truths, certain happenings
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  Are microcosms that can be understood by all
[11:24.000 --> 11:32.000]  And that demonstrate an idea that can be easily understood and save society
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've been following for five years
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  The first time I learned of it was Vice Magazine did a video
[11:43.000 --> 11:54.000]  Showing Mormon Mexicans in North Central Mexico with 50 caliber rifles and M4s
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  That were illegal but they refused to turn in
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  All guns were banned from the general public in Mexico
[12:00.000 --> 12:07.000]  Fighting off the giant drug cartel that was stealing their cattle, robbing them, shaking their wives down
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  Pulling them over at checkpoints, robbing them
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  They got guns illegally from the United States
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  And they understood that it was the Mexican military mainly
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  The Mexican Army, not the Mexican Marines
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  The Mexican Navy is not really corrupt compared to the Mexican Army
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  That's on record, I've got family down there in the drug war right now
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.000]  Special forces and they've confirmed that to me
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  The Mexican military at night puts on the cartel outfits
[12:34.000 --> 12:39.000]  They've got groups like Sinaloa and then they've got groups like the Knights Templar
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  They've got really five big ones that are left
[12:41.000 --> 12:48.000]  And they're simply groups within the Army and the Congress that battle each other for control of it
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  And the CIA, it was declassified this year, came out in federal court and you look it up
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  Backs three of the five groups, they're trying to knock out the other two
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.000]  Then they'll try to have the other two knock out one and then they'll have one knock out the other
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  You'll have one CIA big bank run Mexican military cartel
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  And that's how the big banks conquer countries
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  This is very sophisticated, I'm going to go through the history of it first and give you the latest news
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.000]  If you look up the opium trade, the opium trade into China
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  The Chinese emperors said that opium was illegal
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.000]  British intelligence, this has all declassified in public for 200 years
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  Over about 100 years in the 17 and 1800s staggering
[13:33.000 --> 13:40.000]  British East India Company, Dutch East India Company, shipped in opium into the coastal cities
[13:40.000 --> 13:47.000]  Out of Afghanistan into China
[13:47.000 --> 13:55.000]  And because China made it illegal, it allowed the British troops and the British intelligence to pay off the local police constabulary
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  Because it was illegal, it kept the price up way high
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  And over the next, really it took them about 60 years but total 100
[14:02.000 --> 14:09.000]  They totally took over the country from 1729 to 1832
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  We're putting graphs on the screen right now of your TV viewer
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  Anybody on radio can listen free at infoawards.com forward slash show
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  You can see the video feed that I'm showing you right now
[14:19.000 --> 14:27.000]  So they use that to the number of the next 101 years to take over every sector
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.000]  And then force the government, because they already controlled all the police and all the governors
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  To allow them to break the country in 14 parts
[14:36.000 --> 14:43.000]  And it was given to 14 different colonial nations and they literally made the Chinese people complete slaves
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.000]  Now, the same operation has been run by the big private, mainly British banks
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  I'm not bashing the British people, my last name is Jones, we're having sex folks
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  The point is that model of the British East India Company
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  There's a reason the British took over the world and the sun never set
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  They knew how to run black ops, because they'd been Norman from the Norman conquest
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  And learned how to divide and conquer hundreds of years before in 1100
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  So, they shipped in addictive drugs to control the population
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  Same things been done here, same things been done in Mexico
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.000]  And when they're done, they're going to totally collapse America this way as well
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.000]  That's what Homeland Security's for, it's what the anti-drug war forces are set up for
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  This is the sophisticated operation
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  And then they confiscate the drugs from any cowboy groups, heroin, cocaine, you name it
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  500 billion a year coming out of Mexico, look it up
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.000]  And then they resell that on the market
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.000]  Headline Al Jazeera, Mexican official, CIA manages drug trade, came out in federal court
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  But the Mexican people, now that Mexico's totally collapsed into a failed state
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  Have stood up and the Second Amendment has been born
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  And the government is literally having to recognize for the first time
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  The right to keep their arms in a place where the Mexicans have been banned
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  Since they overthrew Maximilian with guns
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.000]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films or the nightly news
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  Infall wars is the tip of the spear
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  Is this another false-flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote Homeland Security
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  By sticking the hands down on the fence on the streets
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  And that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do
[16:30.000 --> 16:38.000]  You watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth
[16:42.000 --> 16:48.000]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv

[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.000]  With harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  On average the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide
[18:31.000 --> 18:37.000]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  All right, it is intense in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families

[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico
[19:13.000 --> 19:17.000]  Where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend

[19:38.000 --> 19:43.000]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers

[20:26.000 --> 20:31.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.000]  In the heart of the resistance, it's Alex Jones
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.000]  That's right, coming to you from sunny South Austin, broadcasting worldwide
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  And I heard it's going to be 40 degrees or something tonight
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  And the 60 tomorrow, another record cold spell
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  It's going to be snowing, I heard in Denver, all part of the global warming
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  All right, folks, let me quantify
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  Because sort of giving a history lesson on how drug wars, just like prohibition of alcohol
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.000]  Is meant to drive up the price and allow insider groups to run black markets
[21:07.000 --> 21:11.000]  And make record amounts of money while corrupting local governments
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  Mexico drug cartel funneled money through Bank of America
[21:15.000 --> 21:19.000]  FBI says, Fox News
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.000]  I remember four years ago, it was in the Bloomberg
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  $378 billion laundered of Mexican drug money over three years
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  By Wells Fargo on Wacovia and they didn't get in trouble
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  But that's a side issue, okay, I've digressed
[21:36.000 --> 21:41.000]  The point is starting five years ago, AP says starting last year
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  That's when it really started becoming a big issue
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  But starting five years ago, I know
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  There's Vice Magazine, they don't have an HBO show, online videos
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  They'd come and interviewed me and then I went to see my show on their channel
[21:54.000 --> 21:59.000]  And saw that there were Mexican vigilantes
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  That's why Vice is so successful, they'll cover stuff nobody else does
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  Because the mainstream media won't tell you what's going on
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  I'm not saying they're perfect, they're kind of trendy
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  But I learned from them what I didn't even know
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.000]  And I thought I knew everything about stuff going on in Mexico
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  That there were vigilantes in the north central areas and other areas
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  That had run the cartels and the corrupt army and the corrupt police out
[22:21.000 --> 22:24.000]  Because they didn't have any choice, they were being shaken down every day
[22:24.000 --> 22:29.000]  Last time I was in Mexico, about four years ago
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.000]  We were down in Yucatan and I wanted to go see some pyramids with my wife and children
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  We got on one of the big fancy tour buses there at the resort
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.000]  And got stopped by an army checkpoint and they took all the driver's tips
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  Of the day on his way back and he cried when he got on the bus
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  And they walked over, he argued with them, they shoved him, they took the money away from him
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  One of them started getting ready with a rifle and they guard the marijuana fields
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  You're in Mexico, you drive by, there's creeps guarding marijuana fields
[22:57.000 --> 23:02.000]  For the generals that didn't pay the congress and the president of Mexico
[23:02.000 --> 23:07.000]  I mean it's on record and now the CIA by sending in new cartels
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  That they armed in south Texas that I broke six, seven years ago
[23:11.000 --> 23:15.000]  I said Los Zetas was run by the CIA, that's now Boston Globe
[23:15.000 --> 23:19.000]  That's now LA Times, Chicago Tribune, look it up
[23:19.000 --> 23:22.000]  We had Celica Steele, a retired DEA agent on saying
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.000]  On my show, he said they tried to hire me to train a group called Los Zetas
[23:26.000 --> 23:31.000]  To launch a war in Mexico because the CIA doesn't want the Mexican government getting all the money
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.000]  So it's not all monolithic, there's a bunch of mafia groups battling
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  And what's your hearing is the truth
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.000]  So imagine me and the hard work in Mexican farmers and hard work in Mexican ranchers
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.000]  They got some nice ranches down there, hard work in, it's just like Texas
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  Cowboy hats folks come from Mexico
[23:49.000 --> 23:56.000]  And we just showed photos for TV viewers earlier of the Mormon Mexicans down there who started all this
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  You gotta give them credit, it's kind of like Clive and Bundy's a Mormon
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  See what you want about the Mormons but they're the ones doing this
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  It's spread everywhere across the country
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  And I guess it was going on before with the Chiapas folks but they're more communists
[24:08.000 --> 24:12.000]  We've got some Chiapas on screen right there but they got guts and guts is enough
[24:12.000 --> 24:18.000]  And literally they're not going to be forced off their ancestral land up to Mexico City
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  And then up to the Texas border of the McElodoras
[24:21.000 --> 24:24.000]  They're standing on their land, they're fighting and they're winning
[24:24.000 --> 24:30.000]  And against overwhelming odds the Mexican Chiapas folks have been winning a 20 year war
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  That was a small region though
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  Because I like what they're doing, I buy their coffee directly from the Chiapas folks
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.000]  It's the best tasting coffee I think, High Mountain is a plug, Wake of America coffee
[24:41.000 --> 24:46.000]  There's a local brand of it I've loved for so long, I got a direct connection right to their co-op down there
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.000]  But I support them because they want liberty and they want freedom
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.000]  Well these other folks in the north central area now it's spreading across the country
[24:55.000 --> 25:01.000]  They are literal Americana
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  And Americana is not just the US folks, it's Mexico too
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  The whole Wild West thing, that is Americana
[25:07.000 --> 25:12.000]  And they have been kicking the cartels butts, they've been kicking the military's butt, the army
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  They've been kicking everybody's butt because they were tired of literally being exterminated
[25:16.000 --> 25:23.000]  They were forced to the point of resisting, they were able to get guns illegally from the United States
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  Now fast and furious started before it was even in the news
[25:26.000 --> 25:32.000]  Mexico didn't like the fact that their citizens were getting over-the-counter semi-auto and single-shot and things
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.000]  That's what they've got
[25:33.000 --> 25:40.000]  The Mexican cartels have an obsession, you can look this up with HK German weapons and German armored vehicles
[25:40.000 --> 25:47.000]  And Wells Fargo got caught actually chartering aircraft, cargo jets to fly these armored vehicles in
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  Look it up, that's in mainstream news
[25:49.000 --> 25:57.000]  So they've got tanks, armored vehicles, small artillery, laws, rockets, bazookas, heavy machine guns
[25:57.000 --> 26:02.000]  That's not being bought over-the-counter, hand grenades, granados, you name it
[26:02.000 --> 26:10.000]  So the Mexican people are now suddenly all over the country
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  Kicking the cartels butts, kicking the military's butt
[26:14.000 --> 26:18.000]  Because these are all just conscripts and drug dealers and corrupt people
[26:18.000 --> 26:24.000]  Once the ranchers are pushed to the wall, they've always secretly kept their guns in Mexico
[26:24.000 --> 26:31.000]  But everybody would have a few old 50, 60, 70, 100 year old guns, you know, back to even after Poncho Villa
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  Especially in the north
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.000]  So rugged folks, western just like anybody else in the west
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  I mean, northern Mexico is as western culture as it gets
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  Western culture is Spanish more than anything else
[26:43.000 --> 26:49.000]  This is the real culture, the cowboy hats, the leather, the chaps, the horses, the cowboys
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  That is all literally from Spain, ladies and gentlemen
[26:52.000 --> 27:00.000]  So the people are literally defeating armored vehicles, tanks, the best German weapons made
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.000]  And I've got AP Reuters, all of it right here that we're going to cover now in detail
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  This is so wonderful, because here's the news
[27:08.000 --> 27:14.000]  After five years, Reuters says, this started last February of 2013, you know, 16 months ago
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  No, it didn't
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  It started five years ago
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  That we know of
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  We covered it here
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  And now it's spreading all over the country as the people demand guns
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.000]  And a byproduct of all the cross-border stuff is, in our Second Amendment, is their getting guns
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.000]  And it's even in the news, everywhere where the public organizes the guns, crime rates drop to almost nothing, folks
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  Of course, Chicago has a total gunman, highest crime rate in the country, actually in the world
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  Mexico has the highest crime rate as a country in the world
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.000]  Chicago beats it out as the worst city, though
[27:51.000 --> 27:57.000]  Okay, and men know how to fight for their families, folks, you can't beat a guy fighting for his family
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  You can't beat people that have been had their backs pushed against the wall
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  They don't care how inferior their weapons are, it's called motivation
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.000]  And so now the militias are kicking everyone's butt in Mexico, the people are
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  And they're not abusing the people, they're not robbing anyone, so now they're getting support
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  This is 1776 happening in Mexico, this is so good, this could spread to Latin America
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  This could spread all over the world as liberty is discovered
[28:24.000 --> 28:29.000]  But it's because, just like we've gotten the corruption of Mexico into our country, as an infection
[28:29.000 --> 28:36.000]  The cure comes from the infection, it got so bad there that when people are pushed to the very, very brink of destruction
[28:36.000 --> 28:42.000]  They do this, and now the government is saying, oh, we're going to legalize militias, just come and be under our command
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.000]  And they're saying, no
[28:46.000 --> 28:52.000]  So the cure, the white blood cells are in Mexico and they are literally dropping the crime rate everywhere
[28:52.000 --> 28:59.000]  Restoring order, the people are where the power rightfully resides, as George Washington said
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.000]  It is a private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  And recognize that kids belong to whole communities
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.000]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.000]  We are the true media, the establishment dinosaur press is dying
[29:37.000 --> 29:40.000]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war

[30:00.000 --> 30:07.000]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine
[30:07.000 --> 30:11.000]  A practice now banned in nations around the world
[30:11.000 --> 30:13.000]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[30:13.000 --> 30:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, in 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[30:18.000 --> 30:21.000]  And encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[30:21.000 --> 30:24.000]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table
[30:24.000 --> 30:30.000]  And the results are on record, reports documented, a 15-point IQ increase
[30:30.000 --> 30:33.000]  In areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  Bottom line, iodine is important
[30:35.000 --> 30:38.000]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base
[30:38.000 --> 30:43.000]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family
[30:43.000 --> 30:48.000]  You will find survival shield nascent iodine exclusively at infowarslife.com
[30:48.000 --> 30:53.000]  Infowars life survival shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies

[31:00.000 --> 31:05.000]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[31:05.000 --> 31:08.000]  We have the highest cancer rates on the planet
[31:08.000 --> 31:13.000]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  It all comes down to one thing
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  We are what we eat
[31:17.000 --> 31:21.000]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives
[31:21.000 --> 31:26.000]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  All of this has been engineered by design
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.000]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  By giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs

[31:59.000 --> 32:03.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself
[32:03.000 --> 32:07.000]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[32:07.000 --> 32:09.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic
[32:09.000 --> 32:14.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[32:14.000 --> 32:20.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes
[32:20.000 --> 32:23.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States
[32:23.000 --> 32:27.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions
[32:27.000 --> 32:32.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[32:32.000 --> 32:35.000]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me
[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  It was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  That we cannot escape until we can fight back against
[32:42.000 --> 32:47.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A
[32:47.000 --> 32:51.000]  The new infowarslife lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle
[32:51.000 --> 32:53.000]  That can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment
[32:53.000 --> 32:56.000]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com
[32:56.000 --> 33:00.000]  Or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139
[33:00.000 --> 33:04.000]  Coast to coast direct from Austin
[33:04.000 --> 33:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[33:13.000 --> 33:17.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic
[33:17.000 --> 33:20.000]  It's Alex Jones
[33:23.000 --> 33:25.000]  I coined a term many years ago
[33:25.000 --> 33:29.000]  1776 worldwide
[33:29.000 --> 33:34.000]  And that doesn't mean the American government running things worldwide
[33:34.000 --> 33:38.000]  Because that's a corrupt occupied captured system
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.000]  The idea of the bill of rights that no one can disagree with
[33:42.000 --> 33:47.000]  The right to privacy, the right to self-defense, the right to a jury, the right to due process
[33:47.000 --> 33:51.000]  The right to a lawyer, the right to remain silent
[33:51.000 --> 33:55.000]  That you have basic rights that people just can't legislate away
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.000]  That's 1776 worldwide
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  That's the Declaration of Independence worldwide
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.000]  The Declaration of Independence comes out of the Magna Carta, 1215
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  We're talking about the Renaissance
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  We're talking about true progressivism
[34:11.000 --> 34:17.000]  Not the counterfeit progressivism of the authoritarian socialist and communist in oligarchs
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  That is nothing but central planning and slavery
[34:21.000 --> 34:24.000]  That's the progression of cancer
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  Not the progression of more human liberty, more human empowerment
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.000]  More choices, more true diversity
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.000]  So this is why it's such a big deal what's happening in Mexico
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  You look at the director, in fact guys put this on screen
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  I want to show folks the Reuters or AP headline from a few months ago
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.000]  The head of Interpol, the biggest police agency in the world, not just in Europe
[34:49.000 --> 34:53.000]  Came out and said, you know, the answer is arming the public, that'll lower crime
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.000]  And the answer is concealed carry and to armed citizens
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  That will stop mass shootings and terrorist takeovers of shopping malls
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.000]  And you would have thought that the establishment had a heart attack, there's the headline
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  Interpol chief, armed citizens globally to prevent terror attacks
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  That's from infowars.com, but scroll down, I'll give them the source
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.000]  There it is, ABC News
[35:15.000 --> 35:20.000]  Exclusive after Westgate Interpol chief ponders armed citizenry
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  Boom!
[35:22.000 --> 35:26.000]  Now, our listeners know this, you're like, yeah, of course
[35:26.000 --> 35:32.000]  In three years after, you can look this up, three years after they had concealed carry pass
[35:32.000 --> 35:37.000]  Over a decade ago, in Florida, 25% crime rate dropped
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  Stuff like carjackings basically went down over 90%
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  Same thing in Georgia, I mean, it's the same in every state
[35:43.000 --> 35:47.000]  The highest crime rate is in Chicago, New York and then DC
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  What do they have there? Total gun ban on the general public
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  Now, who has the highest crime rate in the world?
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.000]  Mexico, they have disarmed the Mexicans for close to 100 years, folks
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  Because they were all armed, just like Americans
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  Mexico was not half as corrupt as it is now, not even a tenth as corrupt
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.000]  And it was more like Texas than it was Mexico
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.000]  But they didn't want a repeat of what happened to Maximilian
[36:15.000 --> 36:22.000]  Who was the Austrian, Hungarian, German or Austrian prince in 1867
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  Our militias that had taken the country back killed him
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  You ever heard of Mexican Independence Day?
[36:28.000 --> 36:34.000]  They got multiple Independence days from Spain and then from the Austrian-Hungarian Empire
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  But the whole point is, then the pre took over
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  And as soon as they used the militia taker, they said, guess what, now you turn your guns in
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  And we're just going to use the whole same system to make you slaves
[36:43.000 --> 36:48.000]  And if you look at the ruling class of Mexico, they've all moved up to Austin, it seems
[36:48.000 --> 36:53.000]  They're more white than I am, and they call the Mexican people cockroaches in Spanish
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  That's the name. Well, I don't call you cockroaches
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  I'm not pushing the Gardasil shots that sterilize you down there
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.000]  I think you're free human beings, and I want you to have 1776
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  And I'll tell you what, you are having it
[37:06.000 --> 37:11.000]  It is Mexican citizens down there kicking the butt of everybody
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  Outnumbered many times, 10 to 15 to 1, because they've got the will
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  And they're a man in the right, and a man in the right
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.000]  A man on the wrong can't stand up against a man on the right who keeps on coming, folks
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  These are hard-working people that are sick of it
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  And I mean, they're raping people's wives, they're robbing people on the side of the road
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.000]  They're stealing everything they got, the cartels are killing their whole families
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.000]  Their dog, their cat, their goldfish, literally
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.000]  And you can't push the people around forever
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  And then I say it's a rosetta stone, because it's a window into England's violent crime rate
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  Up more than 10 times since they took the guns, look it up
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  The muggings, the robbing, all of it
[37:48.000 --> 37:54.000]  It's a rosetta stone or a skeleton key, a decoder into everything
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  What do the globalists think? They think they're going to bring in martial law in America
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  Bring in a police state, demonize the Tea Party, come after our guns
[38:01.000 --> 38:06.000]  They're going to cause a civil war that makes the Mexican vigilantes look like one-one-hundredth
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  Guaranteed, we got more guns, more of a history
[38:09.000 --> 38:14.000]  Mexico's got a pretty rebellious history, but compared to the US, I'm sorry, nobody's got this history
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  And the point is, ladies and gentlemen, it's over, it's over
[38:19.000 --> 38:25.000]  Okay, globalists, I don't care how many drones you've got, how much RFID track or crap you've got
[38:25.000 --> 38:28.000]  Once the people move against you, it's over
[38:28.000 --> 38:33.000]  The police are waking up, over eighty percent of the military I talked to are fully informed ready
[38:33.000 --> 38:38.000]  It's spread, I mean the military is just absolutely awake
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  The police have got a lot of problems, they've been globalized, they're being brainwashed
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  But once you tell them about the brainwashing, they go, yeah, it makes sense
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.000]  Yeah, I am getting that brainwashing, you decompartmentalize police, it's over, it's over
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  Okay, I mean I'm telling you, it's going to get bad before it gets better, but I'm telling you the good news
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, people want freedom
[38:59.000 --> 39:05.000]  My god, I was looking at photos that got a reporter banned for life in, forget his name, I won't get him on guys
[39:05.000 --> 39:11.000]  This weekend of North Korea, the starving farmers, type in photos of starving North Korean farmers
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  And then add the photos that got a photographer banned for life
[39:15.000 --> 39:21.000]  And it shows people like concentration camp victims nationwide under communism in North Korea
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  I don't like Kim Jong-un, not because he's Asian, but because he's a piece of crap
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  I don't like Adolf Hitler, not because he's German, but because he's a piece of garbage
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  I don't like Joe Stalin, not because he's Russian, but because he's a piece of garbage
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.000]  I don't like the Queen of England, not because she's German, she's really German, but she claims she's British
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  House of Windsor, because she's a piece of garbage
[39:38.000 --> 39:45.000]  I'm sick of these parasites, yeah, show folks the photos of even the military is skinning like concentration camp victims
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.000]  And the little kids and all the people keep scrolling down, yeah
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  Look at these people, look at those little starving kids
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  Hailing Kim Jong-un, who they believe makes the sun come up
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  You want to know who I am, people want to label, I don't like starving kids
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.000]  I don't like black uniforms, I don't like thugs, I don't like brainwashing
[40:03.000 --> 40:09.000]  I don't like state-run media, I don't like societies based on how much can you kiss but
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  And what crew or gang are you in?
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  I don't like MS-13, I don't like criminal motorcycle gangs
[40:20.000 --> 40:26.000]  I don't like Mao Zedong, I don't like Fidel Castro, I don't like thug groups
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  Communist, Socialist, Fascist, I don't like people that are weak
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  So they get in groups to come mug and rob people
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.000]  I don't like the Klan, grabbing some homeless black man off the side of the road and torturing and killing him
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  I don't like the black racist in Chicago tracking down old white men and killing him
[40:42.000 --> 40:49.000]  I don't like groups of scum that are weak going after innocence
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  I'm not a wolf, folks, and I'm not a sheep, I'm a sheepdog
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  That's an analogy the patriots have used for 20 years
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.000]  I'm not here to be chewed on, I'm not here to be used, I'm not here to be a slave
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  And Mexico has the rise of their sheepdogs
[41:03.000 --> 41:06.000]  And I'm going to tell you, they're going to be demonized and it's not going to be perfect
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  But because they are delivering liberty, libertà
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.000]  Because they are restoring order and freedom and not abusing people
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  Because they're fighting and dying and killing the cartels and killing the Mexican army
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  That come and dress up like cartels at night, that's all it is, folks
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  Because each general has his own cartel, basically
[41:27.000 --> 41:32.000]  Because all that is going on, I salute the people of Mexico
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  I admire the people that are doing this
[41:35.000 --> 41:40.000]  Quite frankly, I'm tempted, even though it's incredibly dangerous, to go down and meet these people
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.000]  Because this is what it's all about, this is the spirit of 1776
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.000]  It could spread from Mexico, the spirit of 1776, ladies and gentlemen
[41:49.000 --> 41:55.000]  Is I have been backed into a corner and I'm not backing down anymore and I'm coming out swinging
[41:55.000 --> 42:01.000]  Let me tell you something, folks, if you armed the people of Mexico, all of them, crime would disappear like phantoms at dawn
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  Hard work and smart, great film directors, great mathematicians
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  Incredible art and culture in Mexico, but they never had a 1776
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  They never got out of colonialism and slavery
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  Mexico, you got to get bad before you get good
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  Mexico is so failed, so pathetic, so on its knees
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.000]  Just like the colonies were, that's the only time you get a renaissance
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.000]  You brought the renaissance on in Europe?
[42:31.000 --> 42:38.000]  The plague and murder and wars and death and you got to go all the way to the bottom, folks, for you come to the top
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  And coming up for air from a thousand feet is Mexico
[42:41.000 --> 42:47.000]  And the media is freaking out, because the Mexican government says, fine, the citizens can have guns in these regions
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  The citizens in the next door are going to want the guns
[42:50.000 --> 42:56.000]  It's going to spread, it's spreading fast, the fires of liberty
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  I just want to say, I salute the people there
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  And then concentrate it for maximum potency

[44:57.000 --> 45:00.000]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.000]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  We are the true media
[45:34.000 --> 45:37.000]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying
[45:37.000 --> 45:59.000]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.000]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents
[46:15.000 --> 46:20.000]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[46:20.000 --> 46:23.000]  From the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week
[46:27.000 --> 46:34.000]  The filter is cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide
[46:34.000 --> 46:43.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  The establishment is not going to do it
[46:45.000 --> 46:46.000]  It's time to take action
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  It's time to filter our water

[47:00.000 --> 47:04.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[47:04.000 --> 47:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[47:10.000 --> 47:29.000]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[47:29.000 --> 47:40.000]  Miley Cyrus has come out and said that gays should rape straights to force them into doing it because, quote, everyone is gay
[47:40.000 --> 47:46.000]  Now, if anyone else said that, they would probably be arrested because that is a call for criminal action. That's not free speech
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  I get she can claim his tongue in cheek, so whatever
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.000]  And again, I'm not here judging people. This is not my ball of wax
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  It's not my dog in the fight, the issue of people and their sexual issues
[47:57.000 --> 48:08.000]  But the system is politicizing it as a litmus test to fire Christian broadcasters who have shows that they don't even talk about being Christian on the show
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  They just go, oh, you're a Christian? It's the new blacklist, you're fired
[48:12.000 --> 48:18.000]  That was happening last week with a cooking channel, two brothers, when we covered that on Friday
[48:18.000 --> 48:25.000]  It's that it's authoritarian, that it's not tolerant of other people who want to have their own views
[48:25.000 --> 48:33.000]  See, a free society means that you're tolerant, but you don't have to adopt and you've got your free speech
[48:33.000 --> 48:42.000]  Then you don't get shut down for your free speech, see, but the so-called left is incredibly draconian and wants to fire or worse
[48:42.000 --> 48:51.000]  It was an article last week that was confirmed where a major university professor was at Dartmouth said, I will kill anybody that's in the Tea Party
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.000]  Get out of my class, I'm going to kill you, and I'm not going to give you good grades if you're a Tea Party person
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  This is the culture of intimidation, that's the opposite of liberal
[49:00.000 --> 49:06.000]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal, as I say, Obama is not, Hillary is not, they're authoritarian kleptocrats
[49:06.000 --> 49:16.000]  Now, speaking of kleptocrats, meaning a state of theft to translate that
[49:16.000 --> 49:22.000]  If you look at this, I want to open the phones up and get your take, you know, we've gotten a lot of calls from Mexico before
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.000]  When I give the number, I've got to dial your country code or if you're a Mexican citizen in the U.S. visiting
[49:27.000 --> 49:33.000]  Or if you've got family in Mexico, I'd like to open the phones up for those people specifically
[49:33.000 --> 49:38.000]  Or if you've been in the U.S. military and drug interdiction operations down there
[49:38.000 --> 49:45.000]  Or the Mexican military, I would love to hear from you about your view of now, it started in one state five years ago
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  It's now in six states, more than half of Mexico
[49:53.000 --> 49:58.000]  Farmers and ranchers and others that were being harassed and killed and tortured and robbed by the cartels
[49:58.000 --> 50:02.000]  And again, are the Mexican army dressed up like cartels, that's all it is
[50:02.000 --> 50:08.000]  You know, like the guy at the Daily Planet is Clark Kent by day and Superman by night
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  Well, they're army soldiers by day, and then they're cartel people by night
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  I mean, that's what's going on, that's confirmed
[50:16.000 --> 50:21.000]  The Mexican marines are not as corrupt and they're being used because the Mexican government understands
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  They've gotten so corrupt, they're now collapsing
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  And that's what's going to happen here in the U.S.
[50:27.000 --> 50:33.000]  So here's the headline, but I want your take on, here's the international number, dial your country code
[50:33.000 --> 50:38.000]  And then 512-646-1776
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.000]  512-646-1776
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  Again, 512-646-1776
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.000]  Nothing but open phones in the next hour on this and some other subjects
[50:49.000 --> 50:56.000]  The general line for folks in the U.S. that are Mexican citizens but have a view on this
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  Or anybody that's got any other points on this
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  877-789-2539
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.000]  877-789-2539
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.000]  We've got one person to take the calls, literally hundreds of calls come in when this happens
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.000]  So just wait until you get put on hold, they're going to get to you
[51:14.000 --> 51:20.000]  So again, 877-789-Alex is the general number
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  Now let me just go over the AP article here for you just to break this down how big this is
[51:25.000 --> 51:32.000]  If you just joined us, Mexico's moving towards a second amendment for the general public
[51:32.000 --> 51:38.000]  Admitting that's the only thing that delivers peace and security
[51:38.000 --> 51:43.000]  That is such a big deal after collapse of their terrorist industry
[51:43.000 --> 51:46.000]  After the State Department put them on a dangerous list five years ago
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  After 70,000 dead the last six years that we know of
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  They're finding mass graves all the time, men, women and children
[51:52.000 --> 51:58.000]  After a reign of terror because only government and organized crime had guns
[51:58.000 --> 52:04.000]  The guns from the US that they're able to get because of the porous border
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  There's always a silver lining in any problem
[52:06.000 --> 52:12.000]  They are now able to defend themselves and crime rates are dropping in every region that's admitted in these articles
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  Where the quote vigilantes are operating
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.000]  So the government says come in and get registered and then be under one of our commanders
[52:19.000 --> 52:22.000]  And then we'll let you keep operating, well they're not doing it
[52:22.000 --> 52:28.000]  These first articles from last night, new articles out today, they didn't show up to register their guns
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  They said we know you're really the drug cartel
[52:31.000 --> 52:36.000]  We'll work maybe with the Navy, we'll work maybe with the governor if they're not corrupt
[52:36.000 --> 52:39.000]  But we can't let you have intel of how we're operating
[52:39.000 --> 52:44.000]  Because imagine a bunch of actual hard working farmers and ranchers up against a bunch of drug dealers
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.000]  They just want to torture and cut heads off to scare everybody
[52:47.000 --> 52:51.000]  Well that goes two ways, they're not going to torture or cut your head off, they're just going to kill you
[52:51.000 --> 52:56.000]  And the cartel runs, the cartels put their tails between their legs and they run
[52:56.000 --> 53:02.000]  And that's confirmed because it's just regular men folks that are ready to kill
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  And if you come in their town, they kill you
[53:05.000 --> 53:10.000]  They're not scared, you already pushed them, you already dominated them, they've already been scared, they've already been used
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  They don't have a choice, they're desperate
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  And the way of the samurai is desperateness
[53:15.000 --> 53:20.000]  Ten men cannot kill such a man to quote one of the famous samurai's I'm paraphrasing
[53:20.000 --> 53:25.000]  And that's what it's all about, liberty is desperate, liberty's ready to fight, liberty's not scared
[53:25.000 --> 53:29.000]  Cowering, a nation of sheep will be ruled by what?
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  Thomas Jefferson, a nation of sheep will be ruled by what?
[53:32.000 --> 53:39.000]  Wolves, a nation of men will build a civilization
[53:39.000 --> 53:42.000]  And hell, we all know there's a bunch of men in Mexico, they're not wimps
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  So why are they such slaves?
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  Because they need to take the power in their hands
[53:46.000 --> 53:49.000]  Just like we've been slaves until we take the power into our hands
[53:49.000 --> 53:53.000]  Liberty is not given, it is taken
[53:53.000 --> 53:57.000]  Mexico to legalize vigilantes fighting drug cartels
[53:57.000 --> 54:00.000]  Let me tell you about these Second Amendment rallies, half the people out of them
[54:00.000 --> 54:05.000]  I don't care if it's in Chicago or New York or Florida or Texas or Mexicans
[54:05.000 --> 54:10.000]  That's good, Mexicans are ready to get 1776, they're ready
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  Look at them, the U.S. military wants them for war
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  How about war against tyranny?
[54:14.000 --> 54:19.000]  The globalists are desperate to create racial division and all this socialist garbage and anti-family trash
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.000]  With the Mexicans and Hispanics because they want to destroy them
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.000]  Why do you think Miley Cyrus is out saying date rape everybody and all this?
[54:27.000 --> 54:32.000]  They're afraid of men, they're afraid of macho men, they're afraid of real men
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.000]  They're afraid of male strength, true healthy male power
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  That will cleanse this country of all the cowardice and all the going along with everything
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  What did Rowdy Piper say on this show? It's time for men to stand up and say we're done
[54:46.000 --> 54:50.000]  Time to find some courage boys, well that's what's happening
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.000]  Because you're going to find tyrants will push you to the point where you're forced to fight back
[54:54.000 --> 54:59.000]  They'll never stop, they'll never give in, cowering turns you into a slave
[54:59.000 --> 55:05.000]  Mexico's government plans on Saturday, this was last night, it failed, they didn't do it
[55:05.000 --> 55:11.000]  To begin demobilizing a vigilante movement of assault rifle-wielding ranchers and farmers
[55:11.000 --> 55:16.000]  That formed in the western state, I always pronounce this, Michoacan
[55:16.000 --> 55:21.000]  And succeeded in largely expelling the Knights Templar Cartel
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.000]  When state and local authorities couldn't
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  Because they can't beat the people, they could kill the police chief folks
[55:28.000 --> 55:33.000]  You can't kill the men with guns if they see you in their area, you're dead
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.000]  What do you think happens if the U.S. citizens, the globalists start a civil war
[55:36.000 --> 55:41.000]  Start picking people off and the patriots just go out and start killing establishment people
[55:41.000 --> 55:44.000]  They'll roll over in five minutes, we have the power
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  That's why they tell us all day they got the power because they're scared of us
[55:47.000 --> 55:51.000]  They don't have the power, they don't have jack crap, but they're cowardice
[55:51.000 --> 55:55.000]  You understand that? We will pull 1776 on every one of them
[55:55.000 --> 56:00.000]  It's organic, it's grassroots, it only strikes when attacked, it cannot be stopped
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  That's why the symbol is a rattlesnake, it didn't look in for trouble and it warned you
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  But if you push it into a corner, it will attack, continuing
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.000]  Mexico's got a rattlesnake, well so does America, its first flag was a rattlesnake
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.000]  The same spirit if we take it in our hands
[56:16.000 --> 56:24.000]  The ceremony where the movement began in February 2013 will involve the registration of thousands of guns by the federal government
[56:24.000 --> 56:32.000]  And an arrangement that the so-called self-defense groups will either join a new official rural police force or return to their normal lives as acts of voluntary reserves when called on
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  The government will go town by town to organize and recruit the new rural forces
[56:36.000 --> 56:41.000]  They all refuse, they're not stupid, they don't want to stupid uniform, they want their freedom, they want their dignity back
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.000]  Here's the new article today
[56:45.000 --> 56:49.000]  It goes on in this article from a few days ago to say nobody went along with it
[56:49.000 --> 56:55.000]  And that the civilians built roadblocks, battled cartel members in towns and defeated them
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  They called it the Tierra Caliente or the Hotland
[56:58.000 --> 57:04.000]  Now let's continue here, Mexican vigilantes keep arms despite deadline, MPR, this just came out today
[57:04.000 --> 57:10.000]  The Rockefeller run media, state run media is very upset, none of them, the Mexicans didn't turn in a single gun
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.000]  Mexico to transform anti-cartel vigilante forces, see this, here's the deal
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  People want honor, people want duty
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  They want courage, all they had to do was realize they were cornered
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  All they had to do was realize it was their right and duty to stand up as men
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  Mexicans love to fight, Americans love to fight, everybody loves to fight
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.000]  Let's fight for a real cause in the Info War
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  And if the globalists want to start a physical one, they will get it
[57:34.000 --> 57:40.000]  You understand that? We will win, we have the power, we already have the U.S. military
[57:40.000 --> 57:43.000]  The police are waking up, nobody wants their kids to be slaves
[57:43.000 --> 57:49.000]  The Republic worldwide, 1776 worldwide, stay where the second hour coming up
[57:49.000 --> 57:54.000]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[57:54.000 --> 58:00.000]  And replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[58:02.000 --> 58:05.000]  Fluoride, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here
[58:05.000 --> 58:11.000]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.000]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table
[58:14.000 --> 58:20.000]  And the results are on record, reports documented, a 15-point IQ increase
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.000]  In areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  Bottom line, iodine is important
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base
[58:28.000 --> 58:32.000]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family
[58:32.000 --> 58:37.000]  You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com
[58:37.000 --> 58:42.000]  InfoWarsLife Survival Shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies
[58:42.000 --> 58:45.000]  I take it every day, that's InfoWarsLife.com

[58:49.000 --> 58:53.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself
[58:53.000 --> 58:57.000]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic
[58:59.000 --> 59:04.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[59:04.000 --> 59:10.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes
[59:10.000 --> 59:13.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States
[59:13.000 --> 59:17.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions
[59:17.000 --> 59:22.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me
[59:25.000 --> 59:31.000]  It was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape
[59:31.000 --> 59:37.000]  So we can fight back against, made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A
[59:37.000 --> 59:43.000]  The new InfoWarsLife lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment
[59:43.000 --> 59:46.000]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com
[59:46.000 --> 59:50.000]  Or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139
[59:51.000 --> 59:54.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[59:54.000 --> 59:58.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000]  It's equilibrium, ladies and gentlemen
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  Total tyranny comes into Mexico, finally the people are forced to resist
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  Ragtag bans with not one-one-hundredth the armaments of the U.S. citizens
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  Begin defeating the corrupt cartels and the affiliated military groups
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  And the establishment has to admit it, Mexican government moves to legalize guns
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  For people that registered them with them
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  But before you couldn't get a gun, period
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  And now the people are ignoring that, they are taking back their legitimate power of the people
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  Because the establishment is illegitimate
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  And I've looked at the photos, the videos of the Mexicans that are fighting back
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  They look ten times tougher than all the little drug dealers and the army people and the rest of it
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  Because they've got the courage to go against the whole agenda, the whole system, the propaganda
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  They've got what it takes and it's going to be the same thing that happens here if the globalists push it
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  And so everybody better figure that out right now
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  Good men are always better than bad men
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  The problem is good men don't want to fight, good men don't want to dominate
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Good men just seem to be reserved and humble
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  But when pushed, a sleeping giant will rise
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  This is just how Switzerland got its freedom, almost four hundred years ago with William Tell
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  It's how the Dutch areas got their freedom three hundred years ago
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  It's how our republic got its freedom
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  It's how these wars happened in England and Scotland and Ireland over and over again
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  It's the same fight worldwide
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  It's the same fight of the people to not be slaves
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  That's why I still have everyone involved
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  Jesse, Zach, Andrew, Alpha Foxtrot, Jesus, David, Chris, Stephen and others
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  We're going to go to your phone calls right now
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  Let's go to, I'm going to go to Alpha Foxtrot
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  He was involved in Mexican cartels, their law enforcement in the next segment
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  Let's go to Jesse in Texas
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  Your first stop, go ahead, thanks for calling
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  Go ahead, Jesse
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  Are you there?
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  Yeah, go ahead
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  Okay, yeah, thank you, Alex
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  I just wanted to say I really hope that what's going on in Mexico
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  First off, I am a Mexican citizen
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  I have a full citizenship with the United States
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  And I have a lot of family down there
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  But I really hope that what's going on with the citizens to get in their gun rights
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  Or at least moving towards that
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  Well, and what they're doing with the cartels will really set off
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  Oh, yeah, I mean, if they had open carry in Mexico
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  And we shipped 100 million guns down there
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  The crime rate would go down 95% guaranteed
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  I mean, the only reason criminals are running rampant
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  Is because no one's armed to resist them
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  And I've seen all the articles I've seen so far also
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  That they're already starting to put kind of a negative stand on it
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  They're saying that, you know, that they're going to be corrupted
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  Or they already have been
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  Well, nothing's perfect
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  But the point is they've lowered crime
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  The people are backing them because they're not shaking everyone down
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  These groups are 100 times more honorable than the cartels
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Yeah, and I mean, I just really hope that number one
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  That the CIA doesn't start to, you know, infiltrate them
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  And try and, you know...
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  Well, they won't be able to
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  They won't be able to because they're not centralized
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  Yeah, but I just really hope that people here in the United States
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  See what's going on down there was basically peasant farmers
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  And what they're willing to do to defend their rights
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  And that, you know, sometimes you got to do what you got to do
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  Well, they're already being so enslaved
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  They've been pushed to the edge
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  And notice, imagine the first groups to fight back five years ago
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  Now it's spreading everywhere
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  The tyrants are in deep trouble
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  They got so hungry to feed on the people
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  That finally they pushed people too far
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  That's how it always works
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  Yeah, I just wish that here in the States that it doesn't take
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  Actually being put in a camp before we start to...
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  Well, see, exactly
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  But it's going to get to that point
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  See, evil has a desire and a hunger, it's not going to stop
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  And so like a time bomb delivered by George Washington
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  Who said that governments are dangerous
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  Like fire, a dangerous servant, a fearful master
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  Like a time bomb, the right to keep their arms was laid down against tyranny
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  And it will only activate like a steel guardian
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  When the throne of liberty is truly approached
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  Great point, sir, thank you, Jesse
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  We're going to talk to Alpha, Foxtrot, Andrew, Zach, Jesus, or Jesus
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  David, Chris, Stephen, and many others
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  Stay with us, I'm Alex Jones
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  Here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  I'll also enjoy what I have found to be the best tasting
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  100% organic coffee on the planet
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  Where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  In a highly customized blend
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  100% organic coffee at InfowarsLife.com
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  Without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  You will be supporting a free press
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000]  Available at InfowarsLife.com
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  Hitler took the guns
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  Stalin took the guns
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  Mal took the guns
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  But El Castro took the guns
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  Dominique
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  Hugo Chavez took the guns
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  1776 will commence again
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  If you try to take our firearms
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  And it's time for you to commit on the altar of God
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  Or your soul, your core values
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  You're not going to be a slave
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  In the 20th and 21st century we saw the rise of high-tech propaganda
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  To sell tyranny and oppression as sexy, as cool as the moral high ground
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  Everyone's seen the fruits of it, you know it's a fraud
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  And Mexico, all over in six different states
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  The citizens have gotten guns
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  They're repelling the criminals and government
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  They're lowering the crime rates
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  And they're getting support by the general public
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  And the Mexican government is being forced to say
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  Okay, we won't confiscate your firearms, you can keep them
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  Well, just come in and register them
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  The people aren't doing that
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  That's in the Associated Press today
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  That's what we're talking about
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  And coming up, very frightening piece of news
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  UN should encourage redistribution of wealth, Pope says
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  And I thought it says, thou shalt not steal in the Ten Commandments
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  The problem here is, the globalists are the ones pushing this
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  The ultra-rich that aren't free market
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  That are against the independent rich and new-generation middle class
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  They get most their wealth through government
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  So it's a redistribution to them
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  And then as people get poor under globalism
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  They say, redistribute what wealth is left, not under their control
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  We're going to break that down coming up
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  It's an incredible report that's really starting to break
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  Nationwide in Reuters, Fox News, you name it
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  Secret service agents reportedly told to protect home
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  Of former directors' assistant
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  Yeah, no, they use them as renaissance
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  And just to impress people and scare people
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  They're the political, Victorian guard of obozo
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  But let's go to your phone calls
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  Again, we are taking your calls
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  We got calls from folks in Texas and Alabama
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  And Illinois and Wisconsin, California, Indiana, Canada
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  We've got many calls over the years from Mexico
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  I'd like to open the phones up right now
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a moment
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  But I'd like to see if people can call in from Mexico
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  With their take on this
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  This is a big deal
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  Mexico's hit rock bottom 70 plus thousand dead
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  The last six years or so because of the gun ban
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  Total gun ban for the citizens
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  The criminals running wild, the drug cartels
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  The government connected to it
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  Just literally disguised the limit
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  And only the people standing up is reversing it
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  Well, all the statistics show that
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  And it's another example of liberty
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  And of how the people can prevail
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  Like the French resistance
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  So the International Line Country Code
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  In 512-646-1776
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  What's the country code for the U.S.?
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  Folks in Mexico?
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  Well, let's look it up and put it on screen for folks
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  Because I always need it on there
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  Because I always forget it
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  We'll write it on that piece of paper
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  So we can do it
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  Say that again
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  Yeah, just plus one
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  And then you're able to call the U.S.?
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  So it would just be
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  No, I think it's more than that, guys
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  That's inside the U.S.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  There's an outside access code
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  We've been through this a lot
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  Because when you hear international shows
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  That take foreign calls
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  They'll say dial country access code
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  And say the number
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  England, it's 011
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  But whatever
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  How to call from Mexico to the U.S.?
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  That's the search
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  I'll do it during the break
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  And we'll give it out
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  Fantastic, thank you
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  Here is the number
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  You'll know the access code
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  You're in Mexico
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  You can figure it out
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  You probably call the U.S.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  512-646-1776
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  Let's go to Alpha Foxtrot in Alabama
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  What is your take on this?
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  Is it exciting?
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  Am I wrong?
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  What's going on?
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  Hi, this is Alpha Foxtrot
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  I'm calling from a small town
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  In a small county in Alabama
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  And what my take on the whole drug cartels
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  In Mexico is going on now is
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  The people in Mexico actually had the cojones
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  To stand up to these people
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  They didn't want to see
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  Their whole country fall to hell
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  So they stood up for this
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  They got rid of them
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  But the problem is
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  They are running into the United States
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  With open arms from our own government
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  Because what does our government think of?
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  Their warrants instead of us
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  And what does drugs bring into this country?
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  Money
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  They want them here
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  And they're supplying them a lot of things too
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  But they're out here in Alabama now
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  We've brought down two
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  And for those two
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  There's probably 40 or 50 more in this county alone
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  Oh, I know
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  The Mexican drug cartels are running rampant
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  The police are already being bought off by them
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  I mean, this country is going to collapse
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  If we don't decriminalize drugs now
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  People are being also slaughtered here
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  Just like they were being slaughtered in Mexico
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  For bad drug deals
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  Or losing a thousand bucks here
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  A thousand bucks there
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  Because yes, that small amount of money
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  Is a lot to them
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  And it's happening like crazy
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  And people are getting addicted to this crystal meth
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  It's taught us
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  And it is bad
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  Oh, I know
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  Making zombies out of these people out here
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  You know what?
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  The government really wants this
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  Because these zombies are going to be the ones
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  That are going to want the drugs
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  Instead of standing up
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  But they're robbed
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  And they're believed
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  They want this
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  Great point, Alpha Fox
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  Thank you so much
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  And I want to be clear
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  I'm not for illegal drugs
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  But they push Ritalin, Prozac
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  Type drugs on kids
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  That their molecular structure is just as bad
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  The establishment ships most of the drugs
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  And it launders the money
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  And the day they start busting big banks
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  For laundering drug money
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  Instead of harassing the general public
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  Is the day this all stops
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  So either shut down all the big banks
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  Or you decriminalize
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  Which then brings down the price
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  So now the criminal element's not involved
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  And not being fed by this
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  Jack in Wisconsin
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  What's your take on it?
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  Hi, Alex
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  Hey, go ahead
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  I just want to make two really quick points
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  One is that
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  The only way for us to stop
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  The Mexican drug cartels
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  Is for us to put the arms
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  In the good people of the Mexicans
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  And we just need to arm them
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  And just give them support
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  Because if they get infiltrated
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  It's going to shut down
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  America would have lost the Revolutionary War
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  If it wasn't for the militia
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  That's what really drove us to win
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  And stop those evil Britons
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  That were trying to take our civil liberties
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  And I just want to say that also
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  That we just need to support
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  However we can
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  Because this will float over
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  To all other Central American countries
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  That won't just stop in Mexico
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  That's why it's so big
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  That's why I call it a key event
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  And it illustrates how only the people
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  Could defend against tyranny
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  Only the people in the final equation
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  Could get the job done
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  And it just shows
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  Just like in Switzerland
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  400 years ago
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  Or England
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  800 years ago
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  Or 1776
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  You know, 240 years ago
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  It's the same story
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  Of the citizens restoring order
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  The good people standing up
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  And the power structure knows that
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  That's why every authoritarian system
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  Tries to take guns
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  Yeah, I mean our nation's history
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  Of the toughest military groups
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  Where the militia look at
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  Rogers Rangers
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  And the French and Indian War
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  Those are the guys we need
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  That need to be in charge
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  That need to overthrow
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  People, cartel members
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  And it just needs to stop
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  God bless you
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  I appreciate your call
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  We're going to go to another call
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  And we have time
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  To not come back after a break
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  So many people say
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  Well, Mexico's poor
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  It has no money
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  The UN took over Mexico
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  Pushed the rural populations off
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  In the last 30 years
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  Under agenda 21
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  Forced them into
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  Mexico City
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  Whose population went from
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  15 million to 30 plus million
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  And then staged it from there
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  With social engineering
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  To push them to the US
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  That's the bottom line
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  Mexico has triple the natural resources
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  Gold, uranium, oil
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  It's rich
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  But they can't ever get to it
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  Because a small ruling class
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  Controls it and has annihilated
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  A middle class
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  The oligarchs always do that
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  That's why the Mexican oligarchs
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  Mesh so well with the globalists
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  I mean, it's literally just an extension
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  Of the Spanish and Austrian-Hungarian Empire
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  The culture is a
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  Spanish slash German
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  Slash Native American
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  Mesoamerican system
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  The general public are basically
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  Mesoamericans
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  And the ruling class
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  Have names like Schmidt
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  And Gruber
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  And nothing against Schmidt and Gruber
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  I'm like half German
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  The whole point is
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  I mean, I've studied Mexico
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  Mexican beer is really good
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  Because it's German original recipes
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  And that's who ran that country
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  Hell, Germany in World War I
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  Had Mexicans launch an attack
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  On Texas, folks
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  That's how close that relationship is
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  People don't know the history of it
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  And so all of this is going on
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  Now the globalists want to use
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  Mexico against the U.S.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  As an immigrant labor force
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  To drive down wages in a voting block
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  We could see Mexico become free again
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  And flower
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  They could have a renaissance
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  We'll be right back with more calls
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  The globalist social engineers
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  Are not just targeting us with propaganda
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  They are manipulating our genetics
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  We are being targeted at every level
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  By estrogen mimickers
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  That lower our testosterone
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  And other hormones and natural compounds
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  That the body needs
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  Pharmacists and others
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  We have developed what I believe
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  Is the ultimate non-GMO
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  Organic super male vitality formula

[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  Super male vitality was developed

[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  In nine West Virginia counties
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  Had their drinking water contaminated
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  In our drinking water?
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  It's forced medical treatment
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  Without the consent of residents
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  You can take to protect you and your family
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  From the harmful toxins and heavy metals
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  In your tap water
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  At least once a week
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  Filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies

[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  Fluoride is in teats and coffees
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  And waters and breads and toothpaste
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  The establishment is not going to do it
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  It's time to take action
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  It's time to filter our water

[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  And his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  Frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  And the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  Deciding to take action
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  A company run by patriots for patriots was born
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  Or accepted outside funding
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  They now operate two distribution facilities
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  And employ over 50 hard-working American men and women
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  And that's why I stock my pantry
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  With high-quality, storable foods from MyPatriot Supply
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com

[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  100% organic coffee on the planet
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  From the high mountains of southern Mexico
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  Where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique, shade-grown
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  Arabica beans
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  In a highly customized blend

[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  That so many other coffees give me personally
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  And it's taken us years to secure connections
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  Directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  And I don't think you're going to be disappointed
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend

[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  Of my favorite coffee
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:20.000]  Available at infowarslife.com
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  I believe in the people
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  If you can't trust the general population to have guns
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  You're going to trust the government
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  Can't trust pilots that have a giant 600-mile-an-hour weapon
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  You can't trust them to have a gun on the cockpit
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  And a safety safe that's biometrically accessed
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  But you can trust them to fly the plane
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  Common sense, if we can't have weapons, we're all slaves
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  And my cousin grew up in Guatemala
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  Buckley, he's been off and on working here for 19 years
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  And he's up here on Sunday
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  Helping run the show and produce it
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  And you were helping me read some of the Spanish comments
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  On the YouTube video up at infowars.com
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  Most of them are in Spanish
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  And read some of these quotes
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  We'll punch this up on screen
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  And my cousin, Buckley, that speaks Spanish
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  I will be able to read some of these to us
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  If you punch my computer up
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  Read what... What is that saying in Spanish right there?
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  Red noticiero
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  That means like a red...
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  I'm not exactly sure
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  It's like a newspaper, like red newspaper
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  That doesn't matter, just read what he said
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  So this guy, Juan Zavaletas, says
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  Si no entiendes el problema completo
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  La esencia es un pueblo armado, es un pueblo libre
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  And he's basically responding to somebody
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  Who's saying that Alex doesn't understand what's going on
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  And he's defending Alex and saying that the person
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  Doesn't understand the problem completely
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  And that basically the essence of the issue is
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  Is that a village that is...
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  An armed village is a free village
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  There you go, armed village is a free village
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  There you go, that's what he says in Spanish
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  Yeah, sorry, I stumbled over it
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  No, but you also like...
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  Well, I just made you come in here and prompt you
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  You didn't even know you'd be on there
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  Because you're wearing a sports jacket
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  You're wearing a shoveled t-shirt
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  Exactly
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  And a bunch of other people are saying positive stuff
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  As well, pointing out the government's illegitimate
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  Read this one
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  Right, this guy says
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  Alex, I agree with you
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  The government of Mexico is illegitimate
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  And the government is the true enemy of the Mexicans
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  I agree with you in that they're right
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  For people to bear arms and to defend our lives
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  And our loved ones
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  And our loved ones
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  He's very proud of the auto defensas en Michoacán
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  And I guess that means the...
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  The militia
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  The militia in Michoacán
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  And then...
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  I don't know
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  It kind of cuts off there
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  I guess you should click Read More
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  You have to read more
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  But my whole point is the majority of the comments
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  Are positive out of Mexico
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  And the few arguing going
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  It's the cartel's not the government
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  It's on record that the government's almost completely corrupt
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  And that different generals run different cartels
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  And that cartel leaders are frontmen
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  It's come out
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  The CIA is running the biggest cartels
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  In the Chicago Tribune
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  But we broke this years before it was in the news
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  I mean, Buckley, you grew up down in Guatemala
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  I mean, you've seen this
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  Well, the...
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  Yeah, the corruption is endemic down there
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  I mean, it's just...
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  It penetrates all the stratas of society
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  All the way from the very bottom
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  There's kids that grow up in these small...
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  You know, the kids that grow up in the Machielora cities
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  Where they have really no hope at all whatsoever
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  And the only way that they have to ascend
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  Through society is to turn to crime
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  And realistically, the people at the top
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  That are running it are...
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  Are the people that are running the country
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  So it's all connected
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  It's a...
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  The globalists don't want the real development
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  In a middle class
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  Because they want you poor
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  Your daughter's ready to sell themselves for $10 for sex
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  And your son's ready to kill people for $100
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  Exactly
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  You know, I think this is a really, really, really amazing development
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  Listen, we've been watching it five years
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  The government's caving in
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  And Mexicans are demanding guns everywhere
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  This is true 1776
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  And they've sent the army and police to take the guns
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  And the farmers have defeated them over and over again
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  You're not hearing about it in our news
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  But I mean, the farmers of Mexico
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  Are kicking the butt of the government
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  The cartels for five years
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  And now the government's saying
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  Okay, you can have your guns
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  Because you have lowered the crime
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  AP admits the crime rate went way down
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  I mean, look, the people are the answer
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  Chicago, arm the general public
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  Only criminals have the guns
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  Yep, it's true
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  I mean, you see that everywhere
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  You see it across the board
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  You see it in England
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  Where, for instance, they don't have any weapons
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  And the crime rate goes up
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  Arm the people
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  Where the people are armed, there is liberty
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  Where the people are disarmed, there is tyranny
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  Thomas Jefferson
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  Exactly, exactly
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  I mean, it's real simple
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  If you don't trust the people to have guns
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  Then it's not our country
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  And if you want to be scared of guns, that's great
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  You go be scared of them
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  I'm not scared of a stick-up
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  Or criminals messing with me
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  I got guns
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  They're scared of me
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  And it's not that I even live in fear
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  I just was brought up as a Texan, as an American
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  Thank you, Buckley, I appreciate that
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  Good points
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  This segment, right through
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  I got some other news
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  Here's the deal, I said only calls from Mexico
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  But we didn't get any calls from Mexico
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  So I get a bunch of calls from Mexico
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  And I don't, you know, ask for them
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  I get none when I ask for them
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  We'll open the phones up right now
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  For anybody on this subject
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  Or the Pope calling for redistribution of wealth
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  Or the secret service being used
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  For Obama's employees
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  As their personal thugs, the threatened people
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  What is your take on this?
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  877-789-2539
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  877-789-2539
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  We're going to go to David, Jesus, Chris, Stephen
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  And Andrew first
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  Let's go to Jesus first
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  Jesus, you're on the air, from Texas
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  Yes, sir, I elect John Pabellas
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  And he's in 2011
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  And I do have relatives
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  And friends over there in Mexico
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  And it's sad to me that the way
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  It's changed a lot
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  You hear stories like
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  Cartel walking to a restaurant
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000]  And if you've got a beautiful daughter
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  Or a beautiful wife
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  They'll take it away from you
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  And if you say something
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  You get shot right there at the restaurant
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  Or about a rancher
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  Or they were going to take his ranch away
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  And he told all these people
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  His employees to leave
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  I don't want nobody to be here on the weekend
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  And he had a shootout with a cartel
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  He got a lot of them
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  And they killed him
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  But you hear all kinds of stories like that
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  We're linked on infowars.com
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  This is a hot story because it's so human
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  But the media won't cover because it's so human
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  There's such folk heroes down there
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  That guy killed like 25 people by himself
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  Then they killed him
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  He's like a folk hero
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  In fact, I can't re-spanish
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  So it's hard to cover
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  My cousin's going to look at it all
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  But I've been following it
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  They're killing all these old men
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  But these old men are killing a whole bunch of them
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  Before they die
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  That's true
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  Yeah, I do have friends and relatives
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  And it's a shame to me what's happening over there
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  But you know that I know that
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  That same thing's going to happen here in the United States
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  With time
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  People are going to get paper upstairs
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  Well, that's the thing
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  The average American in the coward
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  They just don't want trouble
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  But when people start pushing us around
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  I guarantee you they're going to get it
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  And that's the same thing in Mexico
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  And that's why the media doesn't want you to know
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  That the Mexican people are battling this evil
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  It was single-shot guns
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  And they're sick of it
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  In fact, there's photos of the vigilantes
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  Taking in some of the cartel people
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  I mean, they're done, folks
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  Isn't that exciting?
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  Isn't that a human spirit?
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  Doesn't that make you admire these people?
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  These are men
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  What is going to fix our problems is good men
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  Standing up against evil men
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  That's correct
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  Any other points?
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  No, that's it
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  Any other stories you're hearing from family in Mexico?
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  I worked at a hospital
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  And a lot of
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  A lot of Hispanic people tell me stories
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  I was raised in Eagle Pass
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  The border town was Pilar Negras
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  And I also heard in October
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  This is what I heard
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  Mexican Marines came in there
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  And they were wiping the cartels
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  And the people that are from the cartels
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  They were taking them in helicopters
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  And they were just roughing them
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  But it's sad to me
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  I finished my school back in 1976
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  In Eagle Pass
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  Get out of the border town
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  And there's a lot of changes
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  I went over the border
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  One time, he had a military vehicle
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  And on the side of Mexico
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  I can name the military vehicle
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  It looked like a tank with a machine gun point
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  Straight at you
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  And I said, man, things have changed a lot
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  But you just said the Mexican marinos
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  Are throwing cartel people out of helicopters
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  That's the story I heard
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  No, no, I've got family down there right now
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  They say it's...
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  I've got family served like 20 tours
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  But in the Army 31 years
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  He says it's crazy
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  Each and every day
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  Two to five times higher concentrations
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  Of pollutants than even outdoor air
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  And the types of mold in mildew
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  Link to numerous conditions
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  And don't forget the fact that
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  Six million Americans live with pets
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  They're allergic to as well
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  When I began to research these statistics
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  It was clear to me
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  It was time to start cleansing my lungs
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  In order to combat the toxic environment
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  That we cannot escape
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  But that we can fight back against
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  And manufactured in the USA
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  Is here in a convenient spray bottle
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  That can be brought with you

[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000]  The globalists have controlled
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000]  The mainstream media for a long time
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000]  But now they're expanding
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000]  Making the weaponization even more vicious
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  And deceptive
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000]  All the major networks are state-run
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  We are partnering this year with the NFL
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000]  The NFL has become a political weapon
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000]  Against the Second Amendment
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  And pushes Obamacare
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  MSNBC tells us that
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000]  Our children belong to the state
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  We have to break through our kind of
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  Private idea that kids belong to their parents
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  Or kids belong to their families
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  And recognize that kids belong to whole communities
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  It is more important than ever
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  To realize that we are not the alternative media
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  We are the true media
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  We are in an information war
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000]  And we are losing that war

[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000]  Network
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:15.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000]  Is it going to be cowboys that are going to save North America?
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  Clive and Bundy demonized
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000]  But they stood up against the feds with guns
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  Starting to shoot anybody that engaged in the First Amendment
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  Free speech zones, attack dogs
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000]  They walked up against them with their guns
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  Aimed at them and stood up against them
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  And now in Mexico, it's cowboys again
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  That are beating the drug cartels
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  And the corrupt government that runs them
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000]  Very exciting
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  This is what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  Listen, somebody tries to push you around
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  And dominate you and make you their slave
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  And tell you you've done something wrong when you hadn't
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  That's an enemy trying to enslave you
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  And you've got to stand up against them
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  And race through calls
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  David and Chris and Stephen and Andrew
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  And so many others
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  Let's go to your calls right now on Mexico
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  Developing its own Second Amendment
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  And the people lowering the crime rate
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  I read AP earlier admitting the crime rates have plunged
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  In the eight, in the six states and in all these towns
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  Where they've armed the towns, set up checkpoints
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  And let the cartels in and they won't have a firefight
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  They get one
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  And the cartels are running
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Or you can just let them walk into a restaurant
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  Demand your wife and children
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  Or come to your house and kill you
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  I mean, you can only lay down so long, ladies and gentlemen
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  It feels much better to attack when you've been attacked
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  And it's what creates a free society
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  And I don't want to fight, I'm not looking for trouble
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  But you know what, I'm not going to be a slave
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  They want to send us to FEMA camps
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  They want to do all this
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  They're going to get a war
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  And they know it
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  This is illegitimate
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  A bunch of globalists in Europe
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  Want to control Mexico in the U.S.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  Want to suck us dry
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  Want to be tax exempt
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  Want to have the Pope run around for them
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  Calling for wealth redistribution
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  I'm going to talk about that in the next segment
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  But right now, let's go to your calls
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  David, in California, you're on the air
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  Go ahead
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  George Washington said a free people
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  Not only to be armed but disciplined
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  And that's exactly what the Mexicans are doing
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  And I salute them
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  We salute you
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  This is what it's all about
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  Go ahead
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  He also said to rely upon a militia
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  Is to rest upon a broken staff
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  So he needed his words pretty far
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  Well, no, no, he was talking about that
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  In combat against the British
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  Early in the war, he wanted to organize
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  Military units trained by the Prussians
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  And that was out of context in the specific
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  To the militia being the main battle force
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  It was one of the few areas where George Washington
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  Was proven wrong
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  You're a dominant male, Alex
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  Gentlemen, I love your show
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  I appreciate your call
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  I'm not disagreeing with you
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  That's just a fact
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  Let's talk to Chris in Indiana
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  Chris, you're on the air
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  Go ahead
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  Hey, Alex
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  Yes, sir
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  Hey, I grew up in the Mexican-like state
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  Of Illinois
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  And now I live in Indiana
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  And I'm a concealed-carry weapon permit holder
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  Real quick, I'd like to make a suggestion
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  For a guest, Steve Harris
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  And Dora Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  I think that'd be a great thing
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  Because they're from England
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  And all their guns are bad as well
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  Well, I met them
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  I got invited to backstage
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  One day, my stand was here
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  When they played out at the Formula One track
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  And one of them, I know, has heard the show
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  It was like a Christian
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  But I got to meet some of the other guys
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  And I like Iron Maiden
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  It's really great poetry
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  It's the opposite of Satanism
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  The churches don't even know
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  What they're listening to
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  They don't even read the lyrics
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  And I would like to get the folks
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  From Iron Maiden on
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  That's a good idea
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  We try to get the lead guy on
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  He's a billionaire from his other business ventures
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  He's launching his own airline
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  So that's probably the angle to get him on
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  You're already working on him
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  And again, I want to tell the crew something
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  Were you just on air?
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  Because I want you guys
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  When you pop in to update on something like that
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  It's going to be live
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  Live, gotcha
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  That's a three-year beg process
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  I've done that just as
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  Buckley, I want you to enforce that
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  That I want the guys on the show
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  You know, if they're going to pop in
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  Hey, we're already working on that
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  I want people to hear them
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  We like being on the air
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  There's just so much talent back here
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  We don't want to take up your show
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  Well, it doesn't matter
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  I mean, you guys are working on it
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  So good, say, hey, we're working on it
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  Just don't wait for orders from headquarters
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  Time in
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  Yes, sir
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  Geez
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  Anyways, thank you, sir
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  I appreciate your good
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  Do you have any points on the topic?
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  Yeah, I'm here in Southern Indiana
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  Our mayor is part of that Bloomberg group
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  Mayors Against the Legal Gun
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  No, it's an anti-gun mafia
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  It's an anti-gun mafia to circumvent
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  Federal law and overthrow the Republic
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  What a swimy group
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  You're right
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  And when I was going to get my concealed
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  carry weapon permit last year
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  About a couple months after Sandy Hook
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  Had a couple of patriots
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  in front of me at the police department
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  Also getting it
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  Like, yeah, I'm here for my concealed carry weapon permit
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  And I had about five people in front of me
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  And it's like, I got the stats here
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  It just goes up like every quarter
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  It's like 500,000 people
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  And it's not just men
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  It's about three-quarter male, quarter female
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  There is a revolution
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  It's not even about guns
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  It's about saying we are good
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  I took the cast of the hit TV show
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  Silicon Valley out at Mike Judge's Ranch
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  He'd before it premiered
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  And we shot 50 cows and much other guns
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  And a bunch of these people never shot guns
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  And had been kind of liberal
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  And within hours of shooting guns
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  They went, I drive a car, I pay taxes
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  Why does the government only have guns?
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  This girl was shooting bulls-eye at 200 yards
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  The first time she shot
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  You know, the redhead guy
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  A bunch of them were there
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  A bunch of those guys were there
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  In fact, most of those guys
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  That are on screen were there
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  They were all great shots
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  The first time they'd shot
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  And they were like, wow, this is no big deal
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  Yeah, why couldn't I have a gun?
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  And that's what's happening here
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  Is that we are literally promoting liberty
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  One person at a time
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  And people who've never shot guns
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  They shoot and they go, this is easy
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  Why shouldn't I be trusted to have guns?
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  This is the 1776 revolution
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  This is it
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  And it will extinct criminal activity
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  To a great extent
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  Kennesaw, Georgia had a 90-plus percent
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  Drop in crime within five years
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  Of mandatory gun ownership
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  Now, I don't believe
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  Constitutionally, you can have
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  mandatory gun ownership
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  I understand it's in the Constitution
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  That all able-bodied men have to have guns
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  But maybe you can do that as national
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  Militia conscription
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  It is in the Constitution
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  Not foreign conscription, domestic conscription
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  But we got to watch it
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  Because the globalists will just turn them
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  Into their own domestic army against us
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  But it doesn't matter
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  The unconstitutional law in Georgia
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  Made the crime rate go down
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  I appreciate your call
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  Let's move quick
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  I'll never get to all these calls
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  One call a segment
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  Let's talk to Andrew in Illinois
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  Another call from Illinois
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  Go ahead
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  Oh, Alex
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  I want to talk a little bit off the subject
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  That's about something happening in our past
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  And that is the Guiana-Jonestown massacre
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  There was an improperly built cyanide holding pond
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  That contaminated the groundwater
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  That the wells were put into
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  And that people were sick and dying
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  And that is why they had to kill off
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  With staged cyanide bottles
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  To absolve the gold mining company
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  From being involved
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  Yeah, I've read that
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  I've seen that
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  Yeah, the CIA was involved
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  That's even in mainline TV shows
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  But that was the real reason
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  They were killed to absolve the gold companies
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  Well, that's great, brother
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  We're talking about arming people worldwide
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  If you can't trust citizens with guns
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  How would you trust the government?
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  What's your take on that?
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  I've got that void card
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  I'm getting a concealed permit
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  In the next two months or two
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  Well, good
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  I appreciate your call
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  God bless you
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  I'm trying to be mean
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  We're just on the topic here
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  You're in London and Canada
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  You're on the air
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  Go ahead
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  It's so good to talk to you
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  Hello?
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  Yeah, you're on the air
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  Worldwide
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  The last time I spoke to you
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  Was on George Norris' show
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  About having a difficult time
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  Calling in
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  I don't know if you remember
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  I don't really remember
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  But you're on the air, brother
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  Bigger than Dallas
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  Okay, so just as an aside
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  I thought that maybe you could
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  Feel like a text messaging tip system
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  That's a great point
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  We could have like a little box
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  On a page on InfoWars
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  Where folks can just put text messages
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  In continually
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  And then that way we can get
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  News tips and stuff like drudges
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  That's a great idea
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  I appreciate your call
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  These calls are not on topic, folks
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  JT Coyote out of Colorado
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  You're on the air, sir
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  What's your take on this?
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  Hey, Alex
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  Hey
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  I tell you what
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  1776 is going to be
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  Old grandad's protecting your
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  Grandchildren's future
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  With single shot rifles
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  And the Constitution
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  Clive Bundy and this
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  This hero down in Mexico
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  With his rolling block rifle
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  These are the people
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  That are going to show the children
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  How to keep their liberty
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  And even if they take our guns
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  We can walk in and where
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  The enemy's at with a knife
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  And our hammer
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  I mean, this is, I mean
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  Baseball bath, anything
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  I'll give you boodles
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  The will to resist is victory
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  Stay there, I want you to finish
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  Your point
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  JT Coyote straight ahead
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  Abidi, Alex, Jesus
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  And Mark
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  We're going to go to all of you
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  Straight ahead
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  And then I'm going to hit
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  The Pope calling for
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  Wealth redistribution
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  In the last 50 years
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  Iodine has been phased
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  Out of our staple foods
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  And replaced with the halogen
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  Bromine, a practice now
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  Banned in nations around the world
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  Fluoride
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  Ladies and gentlemen
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  Alex Jones here
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  In 1924
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  The federal government did the right thing
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  And encouraged salt producers
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  To add iodine
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  It's the good halogen
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  On the periodic table
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  And the results are on record
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  Reports documented
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  A 15-point IQ increase
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  In areas that had previously
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  Been deficient in iodine
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  Bottom line, iodine is important
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  Unbound, clean
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  In a glycerin base
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  Nacin-iodine was the answer
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  For myself and my family
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  You will find Survival Shield
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  Nacin-iodine exclusively

[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  I take it every day
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  That's InfowarsLife.com

[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  888-253-3139
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  From the water table
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  To our soils
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  To the atmosphere itself
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  Our world is becoming
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  More and more toxic
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  Each and every day
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  But it's not just the air
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  Outside that's toxic
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  Indoor air has been shown
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  To have two to five times
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  Higher concentrations
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  Of pollutants than even outdoor air
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  And most Americans spend
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  90% of their time
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  Inside using toxic chemicals
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  Within their homes
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  There are more than
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  42 million smokers
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  In the United States
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  Well over a thousand types
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  Of mold and mildew
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  Link to numerous conditions
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  And don't forget the fact
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  That 6 million Americans
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  Live with pets
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  They're allergic to as well
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  When I began to research
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  These statistics
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  It was clear to me
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  It was time to start
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  Cleansing my lungs
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  In order to combat
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000]  The toxic environment
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  That we cannot escape
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  But that we can fight back against
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  Made with organic
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  And wild cultivated herbs
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  And manufactured in the USA
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  The new InfowarsLife
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  Lung cleanse is here

[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  Throughout any toxic environment
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  Now available exclusively

[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  On the planet
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  For more than a decade
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  My favorite coffee has come
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  From the high mountains
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  Of southern Mexico
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  Where the Chiapas farmers
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  Grow their unique
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  Shade-grown Arabica beans
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  We have now managed to secure
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  The sought after beans
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  In a highly customized blend
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  Discover and try a bag
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  Of the Patriot blend

[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  That so many other coffees
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  Give me personally
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  And it's taken us years
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  To secure connections directly
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  To the Chiapas Mexican farmers
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  Dropped by the site today
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  Order a bag or two

[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  You're going to be disappointed
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  Available in original
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  Or with our immune support
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000]  Infusion blend
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  You will be supporting a free press
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  All the while enjoying
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  A truly great tasting cup
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  Of my favorite coffee
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  Available at InfowarsLife.com
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  The globalists have controlled
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  The mainstream media for a long time
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  But now they're expanding
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  Making the weaponization
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  Even more vicious and deceptive
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  All the major networks are state-run
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  We are partnering this year
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  With the NFL
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  The NFL has become a political weapon
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  Against the Second Amendment
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  And pushes Obamacare
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  MSNBC tells us that our children
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000]  Belong to the state
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  We have to break through
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  Our kind of private idea
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  That kids belong to their parents
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  Or kids belong to their families
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  And recognize that kids belong
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  To whole communities
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  It is more important than ever
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  To realize that we are not
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  The alternative media
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  We are the true media
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  The establishment dinosaur press
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  Is dying
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  We are in an information war
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  And we are losing that war

[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  It's how Mexico's feeling
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  Once you've been stripped
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  Down to nothing
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  You'll find your humanity
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  And rise
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  Monday through Friday
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  11am to 2pm
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  There's the weekday show
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  Weeknight, 7 o'clock Central
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  Infowars, Natalie News
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  I'm back Sunday
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  Let's play some more Romstein
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  I'll have the great German people
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  Become such slaves
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  Under Hitler
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  And now under socialism
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  They have to rediscover their liberty
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  It's like the Mexicans do
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  It's like we all do
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  Let's go back to your phone calls
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  JT Code, Denabidi
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  Alex, Mark, and Texas
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  We'll get to all of you
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  Again, Mexico, the people
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  Are just getting guns
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  They won't turn them in
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  The crime rates are dropping
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  Where people have guns
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  And the Mexican government's saying
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  Okay, maybe the citizens can have guns
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  That is so revolutionary
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  They've never been allowed
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  To have guns in Mexico
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  And where there are guns
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  In the general public's hands
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  The crime rate is plunging
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  This is such good news
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  JT, coyote
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  In Colorado
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  Closing comments on this
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  Yes, and you know
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  It won't ever happen
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  The globalists are realizing
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  That in the Americas
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  There's a whole different spirit
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000]  Than there was in China
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  When they took it over
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  Under Mao
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  This is not China
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  This is the Americas
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  And we are a whole different breed
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  Of animal
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  We believe and love our liberty
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  So, Alex, take care
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  So, JT, you still there?
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  Oh, yeah
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  Do you agree with me, though?
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  This is a big deal
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  That people recognize it
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  That the Mexican government's going
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  Well, I guess you won't turn your guns in
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  I guess you lower the crime
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  I guess you can have them
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  Now all the Mexicans are going to demand it
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  Now all the people in the U.S.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  Are going to demand it
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  I mean, this is such a victory
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  Not just the people in Mexicon
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  But in Oaxaca
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  South, the Chiapas guys
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  They never gave theirs up
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  And so what's going to happen
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  Is they're going to take their comfort back
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  And then we can have a true
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  North American union
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  That's what I'm looking for
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  Oh, there's so much prosperity
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  For everybody
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  I mean, I used to go to Mexico
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  Three or four times a year
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  And now they won't let the people fish
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  So they're all bankrupt
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  Big trawlers can fish
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  They are literally bankrupting
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  The Mexican people
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  To force them into factory slave jobs
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  It's so evil
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  I appreciate your call
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  Abidi in Minnesota
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  Thanks for holding her on the air
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  Yes, I mean, I just got back to St. Paul
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  And I know you covered the cartel stuff up here
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  And it's just crazy
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  I definitely think the Mexican people
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  Are a great example
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  I think vice actually did a short documentary
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  On these vigilantes
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  Taking back their crown
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  And it's just a beautiful sight
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  No, I covered that
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  They covered it like five years ago
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  Yeah, we've talked about that
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  Yeah, I mean, yeah
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  They're holding their own public hearings
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  You know, out in these guys
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  And I honestly think that
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  When your face is that much evil
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  Like the nice 10 bars that they have down there
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  And all these other cartels are just
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  Weird demonic people
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  You know what I mean?
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  We just see that everywhere
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  You know, the Taliban and
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  Every time they bust into a cartel leader's house
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  There's satanic altars
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  Wow
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  That's been in Texas monthly
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  That they have satanic altars
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  I mean, these people are sick
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  They really are, man
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  I mean, I'm not really surprised at all
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  And I definitely think, you know
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  This is just a sign of things to come
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  You know, prosperity
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  Where people kind of take up their arms
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  And fight back against evil
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  But just an encroachment of evil as well
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  And so-
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  Oh, no, I agree
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  The evil's gotten so bad
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  People aren't going to give up
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  Their wives and children
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  To be right by the cartel
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  I mean, it's over
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  Yeah, no way
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  No way
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  And to touch upon what the Pope said
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  About the redistribution of wealth
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  I mean, since when was he a spokesperson
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  For the entire world
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  Outside of the Catholic Church?
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  Well, I mean, number one
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  The big banks have gotten
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  Literally hundreds of trillions
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  From the West the last ten years
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  In banker bailouts
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  And they're saying
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  Redistribute the wealth
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  That's because they're all tax-exempt
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  It's the big rich
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  George Soros, Warren Buffett
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  You name it
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  Calling for higher taxes
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  On minimum wage workers
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  Under Obamacare
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  It's just a fraud
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  And then as things get worse
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  Warren Buffett goes
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  Get the guy that owns a car dealership
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  That makes a million dollars a year
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  Shut him down
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  When the guy that owns a car dealership
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  Is hiring all these people
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  Going to your restaurant
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  His wife's getting her hair done
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  He's buying cars
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  He's going on trips
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  Middle class creates the economy
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000]  They give people the ladder up
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  Mexico doesn't have a middle class
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  To speak of
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  That's why they're slaves
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  We need a renaissance in Mexico
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  God bless you
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  But instead, El Norte's collapsing
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  As well, great points
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  Let's talk to Alex in Wisconsin
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  Then Mark in Texas
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  You're on the air, Alex
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  Do you agree that this Mexican situation
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  And even the Bundy showdown
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  Shows that quote
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  The flip side to victim is hero?
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  That's right
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  You're either a victim or a hero
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  And humans are powerful
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  We're effective
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  Good men and women can do great things
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  That's what I'm saying
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  These poor Mexican farmers
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  Are kicking everybody's butt
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  Outnumbered for five years
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  And the government goes
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  Okay, you can have your guns
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  Because the country's so corrupt
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  It's all collapsing
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  Even for the criminal government
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  That's the lesson
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  You have no morals
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  You sink to the bottom
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  And again, it's a bunch of cowboys in Mexico
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  Literally saving areas of the country
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  And it's spreading
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  Other Mexicans are saying
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  Why can't I have guns?
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  Listen, US tourists
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  Go down to different cities in Mexico
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  That used to be safe
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  They get robbed and killed
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  They get kidnapped
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  Mexico is becoming Guatemala
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  Or Nicaragua
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  Or El Salvador
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  It is collapsing into total hell
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  And the answer is
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  Deal with the criminals
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  Stop cowering to them
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  Go ahead
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  Anything else?
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  Yes, look
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  Yeah, look how far they had to go down in Mexico
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  I wonder what would be in store for us
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  Well, Mexico's not out of the woods yet
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  But this is a big deal
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  That the government can't get their guns
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  They admit the crime rates going down on the AP
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  So they're saying
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  The head of Interpol came out months ago
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  And said, arm the general public worldwide
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  At lowest crime
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  Of course it does
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  Of course it does
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  But the point is
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  Reality's setting in
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  Even the establishment's going
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  Man, it's not safe when we rob everybody
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  It kind of hurts productivity
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  Exactly
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  Liberty, freedom, a moral society
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  Creates prosperity
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  We don't want to be North Korea
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  We don't want to be Mexico
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  And it's not bashing Mexico or North Korea
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  To say they're two of the most corrupt countries in the world
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  We want them to have freedom
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  We feel for what they're going through
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  Thank you, Alex
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Texas
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  Mark, you're on the air, go ahead
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  Hey, Alex
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  Alex, you know what's happening in Mexico
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  And I'm really so proud of the Mexican people now
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  They're finally starting to rebel
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  But it's rural
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  It's rural, hardworking people
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  That are just like somebody from Texas
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  Or just like somebody from Northern California
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  That runs a vineyard
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  They're real people that work outside
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  That work hard, who live in the real world
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  Who aren't going to have their wife raped
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  They're done, they're done
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  Go ahead
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  But it seems like
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  You had a ruling class for a long time in Mexico
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  Every once in a while, they mostly descended
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  From the conquistadors
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  And every once in a while, you get
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  Them like Pancho Villa, Emiliano Zapata
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  Who overthrew this ruling class
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  But then for some reason, it goes right back
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  Into the same thing again
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  Maybe it is because
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  They have to gun-right curtail
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  Or something, I don't know
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  Because at least here in the United States
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  We do have a ruling class
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  But we haven't let them take full control of us
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  They're trying, no, they're trying
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  To extinct our liberty like Mexico did
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  We're being converted to slaves just like Mexico
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  That's why I listen to you, Alex
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  That's why you're the best
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  It is no talk show, it's like you, period
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  There's no mainstream media like you
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  You are the media, as far as I'm concerned
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  Well, God bless you, brother
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  And maybe John B. Wells
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  People like you, you are the media, period
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  Well, thank you, and I appreciate your call
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  That's her last caller, last caller we have time for
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  But look, I just don't like being a slave
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  I take it personal when I see
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  North Koreans as slaves in photos
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  I take it personal when I see cartels
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  Raping people's wives, killing their kids
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  I take it personal because I realize
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  Empathy, that could happen to me
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  I don't like it
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  And I'd like to be able to travel to Mexico
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  It's a beautiful country, I can't even go down there now
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  It's so corrupt and dangerous
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  And I'm sick of it, I'm tired of it
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  And I want to see good men stand up and defeat this evil
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  And I want to see women back their men to be warriors
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  Because if women back their men
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  Come back with your shields or on them
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  As the Greeks would say, men will act like men
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  And it's going to be the return of men
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  That's going to save things
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  And the return of women being women
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  And loving the family and doing the right thing
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  Because we're headed for the same way Mexico's going
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  And Greece, Spain, the whole world's collapsing
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  Folks, because we've let evil take over
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  And corruption's always there, nobody's perfect
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  But they've made corruption sexy
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  In the gangster videos, in the rap videos
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  And so much of the Spanish music is glorifying it
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  It's not pretty, it's sick
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  And then I'm not a Catholic basher
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  But I've got to say, I have a right to speak out against communism
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  To have the Jesuit Pope come out
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  And say, you know, encourages the UN to push a global
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  Wealth redistribution, that's stealing
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  But the elites, the UN itself is tax exempt
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  The EU bureaucrats are tax exempt
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  The Vatican's tax exempt, you give up the treasure
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  You give up the treasure
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  Of the Vatican to the poor
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  You do things like that, then I will hear what you're saying
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  That's all I'm pointing out, is that the ultra rich
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  Are always making people poor
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  And then calling for wealth redistribution
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  Well, from who? How about we redistribute the guns
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  From the government to the people?
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  I am for that redistribution
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  See you back tomorrow, Lord willing
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  11 a.m. of the weekday transmission
