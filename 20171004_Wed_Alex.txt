[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  Music
[00:19.000 --> 00:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:22.000 --> 00:25.000]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[00:25.000 --> 00:28.000]  That I'm sure will be in for the war room.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  That of course is 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Central.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  This is the Info War.
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[00:36.000 --> 00:51.000]  First off, I don't toot my horn for, I don't know, purposes of self-flagellation.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  Either way, you take a beating telling the truth.
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.000]  But it's something I've got to do.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  I also don't take credit for the things we've broken here.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  Because I want the attention.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  We just covered the best research and the best facts we have because it's our duty to do so.
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.000]  And a lot of times I start the broadcast by saying my head's spinning
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  because this place is a real war room in Austin, Texas.
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  We are really doing research. We really have the contacts.
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.000]  And we're really vetting the information as well.
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.000]  And sometimes it'll make your head spin.
[01:34.000 --> 01:41.000]  In fact, the information I've got right now is so powerful that I don't even think I can even do the show right now.
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  I think I'm going to have to do some rebroadcast for a while and look at this information some more
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  and then decide what I'm going to do because I've had information overload at this point.
[01:51.000 --> 02:01.000]  That we've got a pretty good picture of what happened in Vegas and who's behind it and what unfolded here.
[02:01.000 --> 02:08.000]  But you can know this. The Deep State Democratic Party wing is 100% behind this thing.
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  And they are just a murdering pack of scum.
[02:11.000 --> 02:24.000]  I've also reviewed over an hour of footage shot by different people in the first 15 minutes of cell phone footage
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  where people just have their cameras on or have their go-pros on.
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  We're already there at the concert and we're in a rendering aid and it's 100% real.
[02:33.000 --> 02:42.000]  You can see people fading out and dying there in Vegas in Sin City, sacrificed on the altar of globalism while laying.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  Now, don't show the footage, guys. Don't even show it blurred.
[02:45.000 --> 02:52.000]  While laying on piles of garbage and beer cans, it's just the sight.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  I'll never get it out of my head.
[02:54.000 --> 03:02.000]  And I was really thinking about playing it this morning because I knew people were going to say this was crisis actors and fake.
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  And then I knew they were going to say that I was saying that.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  I called Nico at about 8 this morning and I said,
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  I may play this video because I want people to see the truth and know this really happened.
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  And I'm not going to let them sit there and then try to say it didn't happen and then pin it on me.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  So it indeed did happen. Does that mean they don't stage events?
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  Does it mean they didn't hire crisis actors for many of these antifa events?
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  That's been in the news. The groups are hiring online now.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  Does it mean sometimes they don't stage shootings?
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  Remember in Taiwan? It's like 10 years ago.
[03:38.000 --> 03:46.000]  The president of Taiwan staged a shooting of himself when he was about to get impeached and got grazed by a bullet.
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  Then the other party made the police go check and it wasn't even a real wound. It had been staged.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  So that stuff goes on.
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  And the headline will be Alex Jones Questions Vegas.
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  Well, they lied about babies and incubators in Iraq and got us into a huge war that killed over a million Iraqis.
[04:02.000 --> 04:09.000]  So it's okay to question where I'm going to step as I walk down the street to make sure I'm not stepping in a pothole.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  But I have looked at this Vegas situation and I've looked at the footage.
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.000]  And I've looked at it shot by scores of people more than I should have watched because it hurt my brain and it was real.
[04:21.000 --> 04:28.000]  People fading out, fading away in piles of garbage with bullet holes in them.
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  Very, very, very sad, very, very painful.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  And just tore my guts out.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  And we're going to talk about it all today.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  We have the big news of what's behind this and more.
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.000]  This is, as everybody's noticing right now, the critical juncture of the research documentation.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  Just look at Drudge with the top link.
[04:46.000 --> 04:53.000]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[04:53.000 --> 05:17.000]  Get a white male! You're a white man!
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[05:35.000 --> 06:04.000]  This is the War Room.
[06:13.000 --> 06:32.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:32.000 --> 06:39.000]  Well, October 1st came and went and with it the biggest massacre using firearms in modern history.
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.000]  But is it 59 dead now, 500 plus wounded, many others fighting for their lives?
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  We should pray for the victims.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  Pray for the survivors, pray for their families.
[06:49.000 --> 06:56.000]  But you think about the carnage of 600 people roughly shot, 59 dead.
[06:56.000 --> 07:03.000]  And you think about the communists in China killing 84 million people according to their own publications.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  The CIA says it's 65 million from what they've got.
[07:08.000 --> 07:17.000]  And they fed the communist army off giant cookpots cooking the people they'd executed including children with families.
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  That was the preferred meat.
[07:19.000 --> 07:24.000]  That is declassified. That is an official books published by the Communist Party of China.
[07:24.000 --> 07:31.000]  Blaming the dictator's wife for it all.
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  I guess they had a quote reform after that.
[07:35.000 --> 07:41.000]  Communism killed 94 million 20th century feels need to kill again.
[07:41.000 --> 07:48.000]  Now that said, so just imagine the magnitude of what happens in countries where people are disarmed.
[07:48.000 --> 08:03.000]  Congressman Scalise that barely survived the Democratic Party targeting where they intended to pin in the Republican Congressman and that dugout and kill 15 of them so they could force a special election.
[08:03.000 --> 08:12.000]  That didn't go the way they wanted to in their Democratic Party operation where the New York Times advertised where to go, what to do, they didn't have security.
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  Well, there was security there and a good guy with a gun stopped the bad guy with a gun.
[08:17.000 --> 08:26.000]  And Congressman Scalise has come out and said what happened to him fortifies his belief in the Second Amendment because it was the Second Amendment that stopped that piece of garbage.
[08:26.000 --> 08:32.000]  You got to ban cars because Al Qaeda and ISIS are using them to kill thousands of people a year now.
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.000]  You're going to not drive your car because it's insensitive because it'll remind somebody.
[08:36.000 --> 08:42.000]  They're saying the same thing. Get rid of your guns. You should feel like you've done something wrong.
[08:42.000 --> 08:50.000]  They're foisting this guilt down on all of us and it's a horrible assault and Michelle Obama has come out and said white people are the problem.
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  Yes, we have video. Hillary said the same thing. They are making their move for race war in America.
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  It's cold-blooded. It's admitted in the WikiLeaks.
[09:01.000 --> 09:09.000]  But here, ladies and gentlemen, is the good news.
[09:09.000 --> 09:22.000]  This is not 1995 where they can carry out an event like Oklahoma City that was a real bomb but was staged by criminal elements of the federal government working with German intelligence
[09:22.000 --> 09:30.000]  and a major tax-free foundation who's recently been caught with a lot of money overseas.
[09:30.000 --> 09:46.000]  Yes, the Southern Barbara Law Center was running L.A. in the city where the attack came out of. They weren't infiltrating it. They ran it. They commanded it.
[09:46.000 --> 09:58.000]  This is not 1995. And I launched this operation in 1995 to counter just such events as false flags and Waco and other events where we were lied to.
[09:58.000 --> 10:04.000]  And you can see the power of the individual working with other individuals, what we've now done.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  But if you go to DrudgeReport.com today, here's the big news.
[10:07.000 --> 10:20.000]  And I've got more coming probably in the third hour, fourth hour, but I've got to continue to research some areas of the data line, the research line we're going down before I release this information.
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.000]  We don't just put things out here to be sensational. We put it out because it's the truth.
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  Justice be done. May the heavens fall.
[10:30.000 --> 10:37.000]  Look at DrudgeReport.com. Sheriff, did shooter get radicalized?
[10:37.000 --> 10:45.000]  They're coming out saying they're looking into radicalization. That's because in the hotel room was Antifa and Islamic literature.
[10:45.000 --> 10:51.000]  And because of our FBI sources, that's being forced out in the open.
[10:51.000 --> 10:57.000]  What did we tell you on Monday that he was probably on SSRIs or some other type of anti-psychotic?
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.000]  Today it's confirmed he was.
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.000]  We're not sure he's the only guy, and that's what's coming up later.
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.000]  A lot of evidence points towards him being part of a sting operation and being set up just like Tim McVeigh.
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  They run the same formulas over and over again, but we're going there later.
[11:16.000 --> 11:24.000]  Right now we have Colonel Schaefer, high-level intelligence,
[11:24.000 --> 11:35.000]  concurring with the analysis and saying that his experts in the government and experts in psychological warfare believe this guy was an Antifa radical,
[11:35.000 --> 11:43.000]  had accomplices and had been wound up to carry out this attack for many reasons, but number one, his age, number two, the target.
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.000]  The motive is the target. The target is the motive.
[11:47.000 --> 11:58.000]  You also have top forensic psychiatrists used by the federal government who examined many other mass shooters, including what happened with the Scalise shooting.
[11:58.000 --> 12:06.000]  And he says all the evidence points towards it being a PSYOP run by the liberals, basically the Democratic Party.
[12:06.000 --> 12:13.000]  That's where all the smart money is, is that this guy was a frontman for a larger submerged operation.
[12:13.000 --> 12:21.000]  The hotel and complex is owned by super Antifa slash Islamist supporters who are huge donors.
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  The Southern Providence Law Center and other groups, including the big Muslim affairs group here in the U.S. care,
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  they would match all the employees' money if they gave to it.
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  And I'm just saying that that should all be investigated. The insurance, all of it should be looked at.
[12:36.000 --> 12:42.000]  And the fact that there was cameras in the hallways and he was there five days and had visitors and guns everywhere.
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  When you check into a hotel, they come and search your things. When you leave, they always do, especially casinos.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  Then they come back in when they clean it and they do it.
[12:51.000 --> 12:58.000]  And if you don't clean it, if you don't put the sign up for a day, they'll still come in. That's protocol.
[12:58.000 --> 13:06.000]  They violated their default protocol. Where's all the surveillance footage? Where is all the footage?
[13:06.000 --> 13:11.000]  Well, it turns out we have moles inside the hotel thanks to Laura Loomer and other folks working their Twitter contacts.
[13:11.000 --> 13:17.000]  We're working our Twitter contacts at Real Alex Jones and of course at Prison Planet with Paul Watson.
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  So you've got the sheriff saying we're looking at him being radicalized. That's because they've got the evidence.
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.000]  And the sheriff shakes when he says it because he's so freaked out by the magnitude.
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  They're being told don't give out more details because of an investigation by the feds.
[13:31.000 --> 13:39.000]  But that's mid-level feds blocking who really did it because they're deep state plants of Obama, Clinton and the globalist.
[13:39.000 --> 13:45.000]  And that's admitted that they're rebelling against the president and against the American people's attempt to take the country back.
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  So imagine if it comes out this guy was anti-slash, Islamically funded, which the evidence now is massively pointing to.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  And I'll get to that in a moment.
[13:55.000 --> 14:04.000]  Imagine what's going to happen if all of that unfolds. Imagine what they're going to do.
[14:04.000 --> 14:13.000]  So right now they want to set the narrative, even though it's blown up in their face, that it's a white guy and white guys are evil and gun owners are evil.
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  And so the victims are to blame. That's what they're saying.
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.000]  CBS executives, top Democrats, Hollywood stars, they're all putting that narrative out.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  We've got to take your guns. We've got to take your guns.
[14:25.000 --> 14:34.000]  But this is the reason why we need the guns to protect ourselves.
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.000]  So we have Colonel Shaper coming out saying it looks like an anti-fuck Democrat operation.
[14:39.000 --> 14:45.000]  We've got the top psychiatrist saying it. We've got the sheriff saying it looks like radicalization because they know.
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000]  But they're in the middle of an investigation and don't want accomplices to obviously know what they've got.
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  But you've got to put this out now because it's politically being used to try to wound the country massively.
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.000]  But if you look at Drudge Report, remember who told you all this on Monday?
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  Who told you Sunday night before it happened it was coming?
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  Who told you last Friday with precision it was coming?
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  Who told you to look for the radicalization?
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  And who told you on Monday morning from the HRT?
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  Yeah, folks, that's the kind of sources we've got.
[15:18.000 --> 15:26.000]  HRT on the ground that the place was full of anti-fuckered as well as Islamist's connections.
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.000]  And then it came out six hours later that indeed she'd gone to the Philippines and indeed she'd gone to the Middle East.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  And indeed there was money being wired around everywhere else.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  And now it's all coming out. We'll be right back.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  Oh, and there was room service for two, a lot more.
[15:41.000 --> 16:04.000]  We'll be right back.
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.000]  But with the rapid speed of life, we need to be able to keep up the pace.
[16:15.000 --> 16:23.000]  Our natural mixture harnesses the power of ten known ingredients to let your body relax and get the sleep you need.

[17:43.000 --> 18:05.000]  Now before we sell out.
[18:15.000 --> 18:16.000]  That's what I'm talking about.
[18:16.000 --> 18:24.000]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[18:24.000 --> 18:34.000]  Harvestrite freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  Harvestrite is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[19:41.000 --> 20:10.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a z-shield at infowarslife.com.
[20:11.000 --> 20:18.000]  Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed this video, hope you enjoyed it, and I'll see you on the next one.
[20:41.000 --> 20:46.140]  We're back live ladies and gentlemen. We have seen one of the biggest massacres in
[20:46.140 --> 20:53.340]  world history take place. But remember a earthquake in somewhere like Pakistan
[20:53.340 --> 21:01.780]  can kill 15,000 people. A tsunami in the Pacific Ocean can kill 50,000 people. But
[21:01.780 --> 21:06.620]  then we just see the report and we move on a week later. With this event and this
[21:06.620 --> 21:12.280]  attack the leftists, the globalists, the social engineers are going to use those
[21:12.280 --> 21:20.200]  dear lives of those poor people who were snuffed out to try to wound what's left
[21:20.200 --> 21:27.560]  of our Republic and complete our journey into disarmament. And that's why we
[21:27.560 --> 21:36.020]  can't let this tragedy be used to destroy the country. You see the late
[21:36.020 --> 21:42.480]  night talk show host posing as news reporters, the Colbert's, the Kimmels,
[21:42.480 --> 21:49.600]  all of them, radicalize the alt-left. Then the alt-left goes out and kills
[21:49.600 --> 21:56.360]  you. Then their answer is gun control and they try to disarm you. It's really
[21:56.360 --> 22:00.480]  that simple. But if you just joined us we're gonna go through in the next
[22:00.480 --> 22:06.000]  segment all the eyewitness reports and more and we're gonna have clips of the
[22:06.000 --> 22:12.560]  experts going through what the best minds have put together on this. And that's
[22:12.560 --> 22:17.160]  that you had a bunch of people helping the shooter, if he was indeed the
[22:17.160 --> 22:22.560]  shooter, that he was not acting alone. That much we know. We have hotel
[22:22.560 --> 22:30.160]  receipts now that have been posted to infowars.com via Laura Loomer, the
[22:30.160 --> 22:34.960]  incredible investigative journalist who's in there via Twitter talking to the
[22:34.960 --> 22:39.960]  hotel employees and she's getting the whole scoop on how their SJWs, how
[22:39.960 --> 22:43.960]  they're anti-Trump, how they're working with the Southern Poverty Law Center, how
[22:43.960 --> 22:47.280]  they're doing fundraisers, how they're working with the Arab American groups. I
[22:47.280 --> 22:53.240]  mean this is official. This is their main push and how this guy was able to do
[22:53.240 --> 22:57.560]  whatever he wanted with 20-plus guns inside the building, 40-plus total.
[22:57.560 --> 23:02.440]  Explosives were now learning. Cameras inside the room, outside the room. Oh and
[23:02.440 --> 23:07.880]  they didn't call hotel security. Every major hotel's got cameras hidden in the
[23:07.880 --> 23:13.360]  hallways. A lot of casinos they've caught them with bugs in the rooms just to see
[23:13.360 --> 23:16.760]  what you're doing if they want to tune in and hear. That's come out. I mean they're
[23:16.760 --> 23:22.720]  the most surveilled place in the world other than say an NSA base. They're more
[23:22.720 --> 23:26.760]  surveilled than an airport. And this guy waltzes in. And what do we tell you
[23:26.760 --> 23:32.600]  Monday morning? I'd already gotten the calls Monday morning but then I confirmed
[23:32.600 --> 23:39.360]  directly with the source. With the hostage rescue team of the FBI. I wouldn't be
[23:39.360 --> 23:42.480]  surprised if they don't send the FBI over here to try to shake me down and give
[23:42.480 --> 23:45.480]  up my source, which I'm not gonna do. I'm protecting under the First Amendment.
[23:45.480 --> 23:49.480]  Despite what Obama tried to pull for eight years in prisoning people, you'll
[23:49.480 --> 23:55.560]  never get my source. But they know it's real. They know. They know our Secret
[23:55.560 --> 23:59.600]  Service sources are real. They know our information is real. That's why they hate
[23:59.600 --> 24:03.760]  us. Because we're a danger to the globalist. We'll report what good sources
[24:03.760 --> 24:08.840]  give us. We've gotten great info from this particular HRT source two other
[24:08.840 --> 24:15.120]  times, even though I know the source through other sources to be a good person.
[24:15.120 --> 24:18.640]  And there's other good people in there because they're the folks that actually do
[24:18.640 --> 24:22.480]  the killing, that actually do the rescuing, that actually do the work.
[24:22.480 --> 24:29.280]  They're not the little pinhead, pencil-pushing SJWs up above them. And they
[24:29.280 --> 24:34.720]  said they went in there and that guy was shooting at them and they shot him dead.
[24:34.720 --> 24:39.720]  That he didn't kill himself and that he'd wounded two cops. That later came out in
[24:39.720 --> 24:45.360]  the news. You heard it here first. He'd shot the cops going in first. Both of them
[24:45.360 --> 24:51.480]  wounded. Now the transcript tapes, you hear the shots and they say are those
[24:51.480 --> 24:57.040]  more shots fired. But the key is they said there was antifa literature all over
[24:57.040 --> 25:06.240]  the place. So much of it, it was almost like it was planted. And then there was
[25:06.240 --> 25:10.840]  photos of trips to the Middle East. And that's all I got. And then while it was
[25:10.840 --> 25:16.800]  on air, I got a text confirming the information yet again. And I told you
[25:16.800 --> 25:22.000]  that, that we need to have the police talk about was he radicalized. Because it
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.360]  took them three days after San Bernardino and later the FBI said we were
[25:26.360 --> 25:30.240]  ordered to say it was an Islamic and we're sick of it. Two years before we
[25:30.240 --> 25:35.040]  were watching the couple, she was going to Saudi Arabia. She was going to Pakistan.
[25:35.040 --> 25:39.120]  They were going and getting radicalized. She wasn't even born here. She wasn't
[25:39.120 --> 25:47.440]  even a citizen. He was a citizen. Wasn't born here. The memory serves. And we
[25:47.440 --> 25:51.160]  were ordered to cover that up. And when we wouldn't, they started a criminal
[25:51.160 --> 25:57.040]  DOJ, civil rights investigation of two federal marshals and an FBI agent. So
[25:57.040 --> 26:00.600]  they were watching this mosque because it was a radicalization center and you
[26:00.600 --> 26:04.000]  saw what happened. The neighbors wouldn't even report the bombs and the
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  guns because they thought it was politically incorrect to do so. Plus
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.160]  they were probably scared. Major Hassan at Fort Hood, they wouldn't say it was
[26:11.160 --> 26:16.000]  an Islamic attack for almost four years. Same thing with all these other Army,
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.440]  Navy, Marine Corps, Recruiting Center attacks and the Pulse Night Club. It
[26:20.440 --> 26:25.760]  took them years in the case of Hassan and days and weeks in other cases. So
[26:25.760 --> 26:31.080]  we're not just going to sit here while he's attacking a group of Trump
[26:31.080 --> 26:35.440]  supporters as the left sees it. And the left celebrated this. They see country
[26:35.440 --> 26:39.080]  music folks as one monolithic grip of white people that like Trump, even though
[26:39.080 --> 26:42.360]  that's not even the case. Just like they said, Houston's all white and they hope
[26:42.360 --> 26:47.320]  everybody dies in mainstream news, even though it's 70% minority. That's how
[26:47.320 --> 26:58.560]  ignorant and racist and dumb with stereotypes the left is. And so you've
[26:58.560 --> 27:01.880]  got the target. That's your motive. Number one, then you got ISIS taking
[27:01.880 --> 27:05.040]  responsibility. They normally only take responsibility if they've done it.
[27:05.040 --> 27:10.760]  Even AP admits that. AP said it's rare for them to take credit for something
[27:10.760 --> 27:17.080]  they haven't done. And it all builds up and it looks just like him a few months
[27:17.080 --> 27:25.080]  before and an Antifa women's rally, women's March rally against Trump. And man,
[27:25.080 --> 27:28.440]  you look at that video from the side, you're not sure. But when they have a
[27:28.440 --> 27:33.240]  dead on shot of him, if it's not him, it's his twin brother. I mean, his brother
[27:33.240 --> 27:37.200]  doesn't look as much like him as this guy does. And his brother looks just like
[27:37.200 --> 27:40.760]  him just younger. Oh, by the way, the brother said he'd never do this. He's a
[27:40.760 --> 27:45.440]  great guy. He's wonderful. He's worked for, you know, clandestine type groups and
[27:45.440 --> 27:50.000]  stuff. Lockheed the skunk works. Oh, yeah, he's got all this money. He's traveled
[27:50.000 --> 27:57.120]  all over the world to either organize crime or a spook. And ladies and gentlemen,
[27:57.120 --> 28:01.680]  now his brother says, Oh, he did it. He acted alone. It's him. It's him. There's
[28:01.680 --> 28:05.280]  video of his brother. We'll play it when we come back. Oh, it's him. Of course he
[28:05.280 --> 28:12.320]  did it. Absolutely. His brother's done a 180 overnight. It's him. Shut it down. No
[28:12.320 --> 28:17.920]  more investigations. And you've got his brother, the one that's dead, wiring the
[28:17.920 --> 28:22.200]  money all over the place. The Philippines, you name it. This thing stinks to the
[28:22.200 --> 28:26.360]  heavens. We told you he'd probably be on drugs. We told you there'd be
[28:26.360 --> 28:32.320]  intelligence agency cutouts. We told you that they look for signs of radicalization.
[28:32.320 --> 28:36.400]  We told you look for other folks inside the rooms that it was really two rooms.
[28:36.400 --> 28:40.920]  All of it confirmed. How do you think we knew this? We didn't get it out of a

[30:48.040 --> 30:52.720]  consumer of news and information and in the last four or five years doing more
[30:52.720 --> 30:56.880]  and more research I came across the fact that the elite establishment is
[30:56.880 --> 31:01.320]  fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much
[31:01.320 --> 31:05.840]  better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the
[31:05.840 --> 31:10.160]  bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and
[31:10.160 --> 31:15.360]  so I set out to develop caveman but to not just have concentrated bone broth
[31:15.360 --> 31:21.200]  from chicken but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and
[31:21.200 --> 31:25.840]  supercharging the body at the same time. Info wars isn't just fighting the
[31:25.840 --> 31:30.160]  globalist we're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the
[31:30.160 --> 31:35.440]  complete media assault and winning because of your support caveman is back

[31:46.080 --> 31:49.560]  water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the
[31:49.560 --> 31:53.760]  air we're breathing especially for our children. The artificial particulates
[31:53.760 --> 31:59.000]  of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team
[31:59.000 --> 32:03.300]  based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[32:03.300 --> 32:07.600]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze whether
[32:07.600 --> 32:11.760]  it's your home or office you owe it to yourself your co-workers your family your
[32:11.760 --> 32:16.160]  children to the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters
[32:16.160 --> 32:19.920]  at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[32:19.920 --> 32:24.640]  or avoid most the toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't.
[32:24.640 --> 32:30.160]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can
[32:30.160 --> 32:34.280]  keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting
[32:34.280 --> 32:38.400]  in throughout my house replacing older more expensive filters that didn't do as
[32:38.400 --> 32:45.560]  good a job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarstore.com
[32:45.560 --> 33:04.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:06.240 --> 33:12.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[33:12.600 --> 33:21.600]  tyranny? Well so does he. Live from the infowar.com studios it's Alex Jones.
[33:22.160 --> 33:28.320]  Now I want to just tell listeners and viewers something obviously everybody
[33:28.320 --> 33:33.880]  now recognizes that info wars broke the fact that the police are looking at
[33:33.880 --> 33:40.080]  radicalization and have found evidence of that in the Vegas massacre. All sub
[33:40.080 --> 33:45.640]  evidence is emerging of multiple shooters and I've talked to many military
[33:45.640 --> 33:49.320]  experts that are among some of the best in the world and they say clearly you
[33:49.320 --> 33:52.320]  can hear two different types of firearms being used sometimes
[33:52.320 --> 33:57.080]  simultaneously. Now I guess you could be holding two of them at the same time but
[33:57.080 --> 34:04.000]  this is serious. We also have all the telltale signs of a Patsy working for
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.080]  Lockheed Martin connected to the skunk works traveling all over the world
[34:08.080 --> 34:11.640]  millions of millions of dollars that he couldn't show for from shadowy
[34:11.640 --> 34:17.240]  investments. A wife or girlfriend married to two other men connected to
[34:17.240 --> 34:22.400]  Islamic groups connected to Antifa groups. This is all emerging and that's why
[34:22.400 --> 34:30.880]  day one they have been attacking so incredibly viciously anyone that even
[34:30.880 --> 34:38.040]  dared look at any of these areas. Then he's a degenerate gambler on men
[34:38.040 --> 34:44.160]  heads. You look at where this ends up happening in a hardcore Democratic Party
[34:44.160 --> 34:50.520]  Company stronghold involved giving massive amounts of money to the very
[34:50.520 --> 34:57.680]  suspect groups who had their hands in OKC and other events and it goes on and on
[34:57.680 --> 35:05.320]  and on and then the hostage rescue team is so upset by what they found that they
[35:05.320 --> 35:12.200]  felt like they had to reach out to info wars specifically and then they reach
[35:12.200 --> 35:17.040]  back out and said yes you you you said it perfectly what we relayed to you thank
[35:17.040 --> 35:25.600]  you. So I relayed to you what people that pull the trigger for the FBI told us
[35:25.600 --> 35:33.840]  word for word from conversations in the morning and text from other sources I
[35:33.840 --> 35:40.960]  had double check it. Now understand this is dangerous stuff folks this is real.
[35:40.960 --> 35:45.520]  These people are risking their lives. There's a civil war inside the government
[35:45.520 --> 35:49.720]  that's why you're seeing the type of information come out. Now they're gonna
[35:49.720 --> 35:55.440]  hit us with the disinfo that nobody died. These were all crisis actors they'll
[35:55.440 --> 36:00.360]  probably just edit that and say I said it I did not say that. I normally war game
[36:00.360 --> 36:05.240]  things and walk through scenarios even scenarios that disagree with. I'm not
[36:05.240 --> 36:08.880]  gonna do that here because they'll edit it and put it on the news and say that I
[36:08.880 --> 36:13.160]  said it didn't happen. I've been saying since Sunday night before it happened it
[36:13.160 --> 36:17.800]  was going to happen in October and that they were trying to kick off a civil war
[36:17.800 --> 36:23.000]  and then the morning because we've been so on top of this our sources told us
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.600]  that it was full of Antifa literature and traveling to the Middle East. That
[36:27.600 --> 36:33.640]  came out later in the afternoon about the traveling to the Middle East is live
[36:33.640 --> 36:43.680]  in common law wife Filipino wife. So on Friday and on Sunday I let it out.
[36:43.680 --> 36:48.120]  Obviously Info Wars is a big platform obviously Drudge is the biggest and our
[36:48.120 --> 36:51.880]  sources know our articles tend to get on Drudge that's why one reason we're
[36:51.880 --> 36:58.920]  giving the info. Where do you see it now on Drudge? So that's how this operates
[36:58.920 --> 37:07.440]  and they are really upset on both sides because the folks in the FBI they're not
[37:07.440 --> 37:11.720]  even sure what really happened here. Obviously they know the guy had massive
[37:11.720 --> 37:17.000]  help and then they hear the media immediately saying that A he killed
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.760]  himself which isn't true according to them and B he had radicalization material.
[37:20.760 --> 37:24.480]  Now you have the sheriff coming out and saying they're having to look at that
[37:24.480 --> 37:29.480]  which shows it means they found clues that make them quote look to see if he's
[37:29.480 --> 37:36.000]  a radical. When police spokespersons talk like that they did that day three of
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.120]  San Bernardino. They said we're looking at radicalization. By the next day they
[37:41.120 --> 37:44.920]  were Muslims. By the day after that we knew about them traveling to Pakistan
[37:44.920 --> 37:49.920]  and to Saudi Arabia and we knew the whole story. But remember the target is the
[37:49.920 --> 37:55.880]  motive. If a black church gets shot up by a white guy you can probably bet 99% of
[37:55.880 --> 38:02.040]  the time he's a white supremacist. Not bad. Scumbag. If a white church gets shot
[38:02.040 --> 38:06.040]  up by a black guy he turns out to be a Muslim you can bet he's a radical Muslim
[38:06.040 --> 38:09.720]  and his Facebook said he was and he was going to kill white people a week and a
[38:09.720 --> 38:18.080]  half ago. This is not rocket science. Here is the sheriff last night coming out
[38:18.080 --> 38:20.560]  saying they're looking to see if he was radicalized which means they found
[38:20.560 --> 38:24.880]  material so they now have to look in that direction. Here it is. I don't know if we
[38:24.880 --> 38:29.080]  have possible future prosecution. You know you've heard me say that we're
[38:29.080 --> 38:33.000]  comfortable that we have the suspect in the custody but something more may come
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.880]  of that investigation and I want to understand the motivation that you
[38:36.880 --> 38:41.880]  describe okay to prevent any future incidents and you know did this person
[38:41.880 --> 38:48.760]  get radicalized unbeknownst to us and we want to identify that source. And you see
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.880]  how upset he is because the new information I have
[38:57.640 --> 39:01.880]  I'm in way over my head and by the way the whole planet's in over its head with
[39:01.880 --> 39:06.200]  the nuclear weapons and all the craziness I mean I know why the sheriff
[39:06.200 --> 39:10.640]  right there is completely freaked out because to know there's groups this big
[39:10.640 --> 39:15.800]  and the Democratic Party and all of you people involved that there's no end to
[39:15.800 --> 39:18.600]  what they'll do I mean they said they're gonna overthrow the president and have a
[39:18.600 --> 39:22.400]  civil war this month they said they're gonna kill the Republicans they've had
[39:22.400 --> 39:26.520]  top Democratic strategist on TV say hashtag Republicans when the guy went
[39:26.520 --> 39:30.600]  shot Scalise they had his friend on to say he wasn't a bad guy he did the right
[39:30.600 --> 39:35.680]  thing because of politics and well Blitzer nodded his head they're getting
[39:35.680 --> 39:40.200]  ready for war and in full spectrum dominance they're going to carry out the
[39:40.200 --> 39:44.360]  attacks and then they're gonna turn around and blame us and say our rights
[39:44.360 --> 39:49.120]  and our freedoms are to blame get it that's 21st century warfare you carry
[39:49.120 --> 39:56.600]  out the attack and then you blame your enemy who you just killed but here's the
[39:56.600 --> 40:02.120]  deal smart people see through it so here's Colonel Schaefer then I'm gonna
[40:02.120 --> 40:06.120]  play the top forensic psychologist psychiatrist who by the way is getting
[40:06.120 --> 40:11.320]  all sorts of threats right now for daring to point out hey CNN's at fault
[40:11.320 --> 40:15.920]  here CNN's the one radicalized in calling for violence saying all white
[40:15.920 --> 40:19.200]  people are racist and they got all these white folks that say they got to go out
[40:19.200 --> 40:26.080]  and show they're not bad these guys have courage to be doing this because they're
[40:26.080 --> 40:29.360]  coming after everybody that stands up and points out what's really going on
[40:29.360 --> 40:33.960]  here is Colonel Schaefer last night I think it's shaping up to be a very
[40:33.960 --> 40:38.280]  deliberate act of terror this is beyond dispute dispute the question becomes
[40:38.280 --> 40:41.760]  motive everybody seems to be searching searching for a motive Martha I would
[40:41.760 --> 40:46.800]  argue most of the clues of the motive is right in front of us right this
[40:46.800 --> 40:51.360]  individual parallels in many ways by age and prior by predisposition of being
[40:51.360 --> 40:56.320]  unstable the shooter who attacked Congressman Scalise back in June they
[40:56.320 --> 41:02.000]  go Hodgkinson attack the very similar age they are both considered unstable and
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.040]  so in many ways after talking to both the psychological professional and some
[41:06.040 --> 41:09.480]  other folks in law enforcement there's a lot of parallels there let's look at the
[41:09.480 --> 41:13.800]  target as well it was a politically selected target I think the target being
[41:13.800 --> 41:17.280]  selected and let me say this is the perception based on available information
[41:17.280 --> 41:21.560]  the perception was there's going to be a lot of pro-gun folks there Trump
[41:21.560 --> 41:27.080]  supporters at this concert so therefore I believe the perception was by the
[41:27.080 --> 41:33.640]  shooter by the individual who did this by a paddock that this was a legitimate
[41:33.640 --> 41:38.120]  target of political expression Martha this may be something people don't like
[41:38.120 --> 41:42.800]  to understand but the very reason that Hodgkinson did what he did and I believe
[41:42.800 --> 41:46.720]  paddock did what he did is because the left is now encouraged the use of
[41:46.720 --> 41:50.880]  violence as an extension and use of political speech and this is what we
[41:50.880 --> 41:54.440]  have to be very careful about the slippery slope the idea here that
[41:54.440 --> 41:58.920]  somehow violence can become part of someone expressing themselves and I
[41:58.920 --> 42:02.280]  think that's the real danger here let me start something else out there there
[42:02.280 --> 42:07.120]  was no violence perpetrated by against Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton during
[42:07.120 --> 42:11.060]  the run-ups to this election so this has become a feature of desensitization by
[42:11.060 --> 42:15.400]  the left the Catholic Griffith beheading fake beheading the president
[42:15.400 --> 42:18.960]  things like this I think are what's pushing a lot of folks to believe now
[42:18.960 --> 42:24.280]  that somehow violence is an acceptable piece of their political justify Chafer
[42:24.280 --> 42:29.080]  is 100% on target that's exactly what they're doing then they play dumb when
[42:29.080 --> 42:33.000]  it happens and say we're gonna take your rights after they've created the
[42:33.000 --> 42:38.960]  climate for this to happen this is a plan program and he's to run major CIA
[42:38.960 --> 42:43.160]  operations in the field he's telling you point blank what it is we've got more
[42:43.160 --> 42:50.760]  straight ahead December 23rd 1776 these are the times that try men's souls the
[42:50.760 --> 42:54.600]  summer soldier and the Sunshine Patriot wheel in this crisis shrink from the
[42:54.600 --> 42:58.400]  service of their country but he that stands by it now deserves the love and
[42:58.400 --> 43:03.600]  thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have
[43:03.600 --> 43:07.400]  this consolation with us that the heart of the conflict the more glorious the
[43:07.400 --> 43:12.160]  triumph what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly it is dearness only
[43:12.160 --> 43:16.480]  that gives everything its value heaven knows how to put a proper price on its
[43:16.480 --> 43:20.920]  goods and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom
[43:20.920 --> 43:25.480]  should not be highly rated Britain with an army to enforce her tyranny has
[43:25.480 --> 43:29.880]  declared that she has a right not only to tax but to bind us in all cases
[43:29.880 --> 43:34.440]  whatsoever and if being bound in that matter is not slavery then there is no
[43:34.440 --> 43:38.480]  such thing as slavery upon earth even the expression is impious for so

[47:51.200 --> 48:02.480]  kleptocratic psychopathic globalists that are so ruthless if you just joined
[48:02.480 --> 48:07.040]  this Colonel Schaefer one on Fox News last night and said from his sources in
[48:07.040 --> 48:12.040]  the government this is a leftist Democratic Party operation with mainstream
[48:12.040 --> 48:16.560]  media corporate media hyping the climate of kill the Republicans kill the
[48:16.560 --> 48:21.000]  white people and Michelle Obama came out and said that the government's bad
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.960]  because there's white people and there and there's men that's a quote that's
[48:24.960 --> 48:30.720]  coming up you see Trudeau saying after another Islamic attack Sunday he said
[48:30.720 --> 48:34.800]  white supremacism is the problem we apologize for it so when a black guy
[48:34.800 --> 48:39.600]  kills white people it runs them over you just say that as cognitive dissonance
[48:39.600 --> 48:45.520]  and you keep pushing and then when your target gets shot up and 500 people get
[48:45.520 --> 48:51.360]  shot and 59 get killed you turn around and say see white people turn your gun
[48:51.360 --> 48:54.800]  in oh and when people don't take their vaccines you have the head of the Texas
[48:54.800 --> 49:00.240]  vaccine program out of Baylor say we've got to get rid of the white people let's
[49:00.240 --> 49:06.840]  kill them see this all sounds insane but they all said that the deputy had a
[49:06.840 --> 49:11.040]  CBS said these are a bunch of white Republicans they deserve it she's a
[49:11.040 --> 49:16.080]  white woman they've gotten so radicalized with their own propaganda that
[49:16.080 --> 49:20.200]  they're believing all this stuff and then when their folks go out and kill
[49:20.200 --> 49:27.600]  they cover it up and they blame it on the victims and you see Democrats all
[49:27.600 --> 49:31.360]  over the place I've got a stack of news of Democrats celebrating the dead
[49:31.360 --> 49:35.040]  simultaneously oh we love them so much oh but they deserve it they're a bunch of
[49:35.040 --> 49:38.800]  Republican right-wing scum that like country music fly over country oh but
[49:38.800 --> 49:41.880]  remember them and turn your guns in but you're the ones that want guns so you
[49:41.880 --> 49:50.280]  deserve it that's what they're saying and they think you're stupid but the
[49:50.280 --> 49:55.680]  truth is you've broken with them you're awake to what they're doing and so they
[49:55.680 --> 49:59.560]  now have weaponized all the media and the NFL and the late-night shows and
[49:59.560 --> 50:03.520]  that's not working either so now they've got to wind up one of their toys to go
[50:03.520 --> 50:08.320]  out and shoot hundreds of people to try to then project it on us and say see
[50:08.320 --> 50:14.840]  we should be running things we know you did it scum bare minimum by hyping the
[50:14.840 --> 50:22.320]  whole thing you're to blame and Colonel Shaffer says you're to blame and the top
[50:22.320 --> 50:24.920]  psychiatrist that works for the federal government's come out and says you're to
[50:24.920 --> 50:31.040]  blame and other experts are coming out saying you're to blame and clearly look
[50:31.040 --> 50:34.760]  at the target look at the guy and it's all gonna come out him there and hit
[50:34.760 --> 50:39.080]  wearing his little pink you know hat and being part of the women's March group
[50:39.080 --> 50:45.360]  and sorcerer and all of it's coming out we know just exactly what went on now
[50:45.360 --> 50:52.000]  don't we we now have it all figured out don't we and so you better try as hard
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.320]  as you can to keep it covered up just like Hillary hacking the election she
[50:56.320 --> 51:00.440]  stole five states tried to steal six others got caught had five plus million
[51:00.440 --> 51:04.840]  legal vote not three million like Trump said it's all come out Harvard studies
[51:04.840 --> 51:10.440]  they turned around and say the Russians tried to hack it well of course every
[51:10.440 --> 51:13.640]  foreign government out there tries to influence our elections we do theirs too
[51:13.640 --> 51:18.560]  but they weren't anything compared to all of Hollywood and all the big media and
[51:18.560 --> 51:22.120]  all the big telecoms and Google and Facebook and the big internet companies
[51:22.120 --> 51:27.160]  and the big universities and all the money and all the newspapers and the
[51:27.160 --> 51:31.440]  foreign governments and the Saudi Arabians and the EU and the Vatican all
[51:31.440 --> 51:36.320]  saying you can't make America great again you'll never rebuild you'll never
[51:36.320 --> 51:40.800]  have 3% growth rate again we're gonna get your guns we're gonna ban your
[51:40.800 --> 51:46.400]  speech your kids belong to us remember MSNBC well guess what your name is easy
[51:46.400 --> 51:50.560]  as you thought it'd be dirt bags and now you're telling everybody you're gonna
[51:50.560 --> 51:54.920]  start killing people and you got CIA deputy directors on TV saying we're
[51:54.920 --> 51:59.160]  gonna kill the president as a threat to the president as if he doesn't know what
[51:59.160 --> 52:03.440]  you're doing as if you think he's gonna roll over he's not rolling over I'm not
[52:03.440 --> 52:11.560]  rolling over and all you've done is shum in the whirlwind scum that's all you've
[52:11.560 --> 52:19.360]  done is wake up America good luck now Grendel thought he was coming to eat
[52:19.360 --> 52:24.520]  Beowulf but Grendel went home with his mommy with his right arm torn out of the
[52:24.520 --> 52:29.520]  socket bleeding to death politically you think you're hunting us get ready
[52:29.520 --> 52:34.520]  we're gonna destroy you politically and we're gonna hold our fire but you watch
[52:34.520 --> 52:38.320]  they're gonna false flag even bigger now they're going for total broke to break
[52:38.320 --> 52:43.680]  your will and if they do that then they're gonna put 50 million people in
[52:43.680 --> 52:48.600]  forced labor camps that's mainstream news and they can't wait to give everyone
[52:48.600 --> 52:52.320]  of these little communist time with your wife and kids in some dungeon cuz
[52:52.320 --> 52:56.600]  that's what they want I'm not kidding they're coming you wanted to see the
[52:56.600 --> 53:01.960]  fight for America you're living it 2017 baby this is it
[53:01.960 --> 53:08.440]  toe-to-toe combat with the globalist politically and every front they launch
[53:08.440 --> 53:12.560]  about Puerto Rico or you name it Trump is there to block them it's an amazing
[53:12.560 --> 53:17.280]  time to be alive forensic psychiatrist suggests gunmen may have deliberately
[53:17.280 --> 53:21.880]  targeted conservatives to CNN actually contribute to the mass shooting hell
[53:21.880 --> 53:26.760]  I've seen CNN having guessed on that we're friends with a skilly shooter saying
[53:26.760 --> 53:32.440]  he was not a bad guy and was a good guy they celebrated it you can pull the
[53:32.440 --> 53:37.160]  article up as the motive behind Sunday night's massacre in Las Vegas remains
[53:37.160 --> 53:41.960]  unclear forensic psychiatrist Dr. Michael Wellner suggested the government
[53:41.960 --> 53:45.320]  Stephen Paddock may have deliberately target conservatives and that CNN was
[53:45.320 --> 53:49.400]  probably to blame well it's beyond that Paul Watson's being safe here he walks
[53:49.400 --> 53:54.880]  through the motive the history here it is this is powerful this is important
[53:54.880 --> 53:59.480]  now trying to figure out why a gunman opened fire with 23 firearms in his
[53:59.480 --> 54:04.120]  hotel and 19 back at his house killing at least 59 people and injuring hundreds
[54:04.120 --> 54:08.560]  more according to his brother there was no clues he would commit such a horrific
[54:08.560 --> 54:14.600]  attack there were clues a religious affiliation deposit a quarter now his
[54:14.600 --> 54:19.240]  brother says he totally did it 100% a 180 now that somebody's talk to him
[54:19.240 --> 54:26.040]  because we need to shut this down now 180 in just two days but again no there
[54:26.040 --> 54:31.200]  was affiliations we know anti-fight and other material inside continue you
[54:31.200 --> 54:38.320]  should know he just hung out or shot horrified hit boss complete I wanted to
[54:38.320 --> 54:41.360]  be nice on Monday but that even the crew said this guy looks like he's
[54:41.360 --> 54:45.080]  completely full of BS I mean if your child you caught him with cookie stuff
[54:45.080 --> 54:48.120]  all over their face and a cookie in their hand they said oh I wasn't eating
[54:48.120 --> 54:52.480]  the cookies dad I mean this guy and he's totally 180 but I was nice on Monday
[54:52.480 --> 54:56.480]  it didn't say this guy sounded like he was full of baloney but but let's back
[54:56.480 --> 54:59.800]  it up five seconds let's finish up with this guy here is the reported shooter's
[54:59.800 --> 55:07.320]  brother Eric Paddock here it is oh yeah her shock horrified completely dumb
[55:07.320 --> 55:14.440]  founded about this so what goes on in the mind of a shooter like this as they
[55:14.440 --> 55:18.600]  shoot at innocent people here now to discuss this is Dr. Michael Welner
[55:18.600 --> 55:23.360]  he's a top forensic psychiatrist who is personally examined a number of mass
[55:23.360 --> 55:27.280]  killers doctor thank you for being with me what happened what's going on here
[55:27.280 --> 55:31.320]  well if you want to understand the killer the most important place to start
[55:31.320 --> 55:36.280]  is with the victims and what we can immediately see is that he had no
[55:36.280 --> 55:41.960]  relationship to the killers a workplace mass shooter knows his victims and they
[55:41.960 --> 55:45.440]  want to see the victim and they want to destroy annihilate the workplace and
[55:45.440 --> 55:49.160]  marty another key point the family mass shooter knows the family wants to
[55:49.160 --> 55:53.880]  annihilate the family the criminal enterprise wants to kill a gang so it's
[55:53.880 --> 55:58.280]  a stranger mass homicide and a stranger mass homicide happens for one of two
[55:58.280 --> 56:03.160]  reasons either a person acting for a cause or a person acting because he wants
[56:03.160 --> 56:07.640]  to transcend notoriety and kill as many people as possible like a James Holmes
[56:07.640 --> 56:12.520]  however James Holmes who was the war or a shooter and you worked on that case
[56:12.520 --> 56:18.920]  yes here's the thing shooting for notoriety's sake and nothing more is a
[56:18.920 --> 56:25.200]  young man's crime and this is a 64 year old with no dramatic mental illness no
[56:25.200 --> 56:29.080]  major decline someone who's intact I think if we want to understand what's
[56:29.080 --> 56:33.520]  behind the crime we should look at James Hodgkinson the shooter of
[56:33.520 --> 56:38.960]  congressman scolese because that crime itself was intended to be a spectacle
[56:38.960 --> 56:44.080]  and and of much bigger scope imagine this what he intended to do Hodgkinson
[56:44.080 --> 56:49.200]  was not only kill all of those lawmakers but Republicans but in doing so would
[56:49.200 --> 56:53.560]  have had to have special elections to replace all of them and if it weren't
[56:53.560 --> 56:59.160]  for the security people who who intercepted him you had all kinds of
[56:59.160 --> 57:02.840]  congressmen and lawmakers in a dugout defenseless who would have been
[57:02.840 --> 57:08.680]  mowed down my point is a spectacle is either designed to cause some derivative
[57:08.680 --> 57:13.840]  impact or to instigate some cause discussion that's right a special
[57:13.840 --> 57:16.880]  election and even mainstream news now admits this appears to be a
[57:16.880 --> 57:21.560]  destabilization campaign of the US to bring in martial law folks we must face
[57:21.560 --> 57:25.000]  the attack we're under and we're gonna beat it yes it's radical to say that

[1:00:25.640 --> 1:00:29.080]  showing that they have to investigate that and that's what the hostage rescue
[1:00:29.080 --> 1:00:34.640]  team sources that I can tell you are directly with the hostage rescue team I
[1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:39.040]  know I can't believe we have sources that good we do because we're crazy enough
[1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:42.680]  to tell you the truth there other folks are scared I'm not bragging because I'm

[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:10.600]  mean the stuff going on right now is fantastical okay the Democrats have
[1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:14.160]  openly called for civil war in October November openly told their people to go
[1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:18.840]  out and kill Congress kill white people kill kill kill Michelle Obama piled on
[1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:22.480]  and said this is all happening because white people are bad that clips coming
[1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:26.720]  up I mean we've reached next level cuckoo land in fact let's play her in a
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:30.000]  second but right now here's the sheriff saying we're having to look at
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.160]  radicalization and if other arrests are gonna have to be made because of the
[1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:38.640]  materiel and that's what was in the hotel room folks he's attacking a
[1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:42.520]  country music deal of Trump supporters Democrats everywhere celebrated Sunday
[1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:46.720]  and Monday then they turn around and say oh well you deserve to get killed
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:51.080]  because you own guns but turn all your guns in now they can't even discipline
[1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:54.960]  themselves enough to actually act like they care about the victims they're so
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:02:04.920]  they're as happy as a pig in mud or as a fly on Michelle Obama or Hillary so here
[1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:10.960]  is the sheriff I don't know if we have possible future prosecution where they
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:14.400]  you know you heard me say that we're comfortable that we have the suspect in
[1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:18.600]  the custody but something more may come of that investigation and I want to
[1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:23.040]  understand the motivation that you describe okay to prevent any future
[1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:29.000]  incidents and you know did this person get radicalized unbeknownst to us and we
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:36.440]  want to identify that source I have a stack of news here with the white
[1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:39.920]  people are evil and it's mainly usually out of white folks' mouth because they
[1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:43.160]  want to prove how good they are and how hateful they are and how sick they are
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:47.360]  and how historically ignorant they are deli owner glad a white man shot white
[1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:51.720]  people not terror but community outreach this is out of Twitter and of course
[1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:55.880]  there's just thousands of these so as I heard it was a country music I felt
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:03:00.240]  relief white people shooting white people isn't care it's community outreach
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:06.720]  really white people are the second rarest group to shoot folks in the United
[1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:10.520]  States court and FBI statistics you know the number one rarest group they're
[1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:15.680]  also the richest people on average Asians like white folks are like number
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:20.400]  nine or number 10 depending on the year of richest or average middle class and
[1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:24.680]  wealth being the highest it's it's it's like test scores it's the Asians up
[1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:28.920]  there on them that the the stereotype well-behaved hard-working smart
[1:03:28.920 --> 1:03:35.160]  judicious eat your lunch and they're not shooting each other unless it's a few
[1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:39.080]  gangs you know occasionally that's usually done very quietly in some
[1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:45.560]  warehouse where they chop you up and you're fed to the fishes but again just
[1:03:45.560 --> 1:03:49.080]  more bull oh you white people are you know I saw that spaghetti Western where
[1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:52.560]  Clint Eastwood was shooting a bunch of people yeah that's the white people
[1:03:52.560 --> 1:03:55.880]  they're all out there riding their horses to the country music thing and
[1:03:55.880 --> 1:04:00.000]  all shoot each other it's the opposite you don't have folks stealing people's
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:07.320]  wallets you don't have people getting in fights hardly but again we're told white
[1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:10.200]  people are inherently evil that's the attitude and then I've got Michelle
[1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:16.400]  Obama Michelle Obama right here we'll get to this coming up we have a
[1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:20.520]  surprise guest on the other side of this break oh acid attacks are way up in
[1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:24.960]  Europe they're calling for a ban on acid my kind of band guns that's coming up
[1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:28.880]  as I had my Michelle Obama clip in here but I can't find we just give me the
[1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:32.920]  article about her there it is it's a Michelle Obama people don't trust
[1:04:32.920 --> 1:04:39.600]  politics because it's all white all white all men I mean what a racist

[1:06:00.240 --> 1:06:04.920]  of Texas it's Alex Jones
[1:06:22.080 --> 1:06:26.440]  okay we got a call about 15 minutes ago from Ted Nugent saying he wanted to pop
[1:06:26.440 --> 1:06:31.560]  in at about five after six after this hour so we're waiting for his call he
[1:06:31.560 --> 1:06:34.960]  wants to say some things about the situation I've told him anytime he wants
[1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:38.440]  to come on he's welcome so I really wanted to get him on about the whole NFL
[1:06:38.440 --> 1:06:41.880]  thing and so many other big issues the Puerto Rico lie but obviously he's gonna
[1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:47.560]  want to talk about this tragic event 59 people dead 500 plus wounded and the whole
[1:06:47.560 --> 1:06:51.240]  official story has disintegrated the sheriff has come out and said we're
[1:06:51.240 --> 1:06:56.080]  having a look at radicalization we're following leads on that because there's
[1:06:56.080 --> 1:06:58.760]  some evidence to that I mean when they say we're having to look at radicalization
[1:06:58.760 --> 1:07:03.200]  right now that's what they did day three of San Bernardino as they said we're
[1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:07.280]  looking into radicalization sure they both had Middle Eastern names but okay
[1:07:07.280 --> 1:07:10.880]  they've been going to the Middle East and okay they were wearing full body armor
[1:07:10.880 --> 1:07:15.880]  and screaming on log bar and turns out that the f-pad know about it for two
[1:07:15.880 --> 1:07:20.040]  years but was ordered to stand down by Obama so they have this history the
[1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:24.880]  Pulse nightclub Major Hassan at Fort Hood almost four years after that happened
[1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:28.360]  they admitted it was a terror attack he will work for Al Qaeda he pledged
[1:07:28.360 --> 1:07:40.640]  allegiance to them so it is simply mind-boggling and amazing to sit there
[1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:45.400]  and to understand that they have a history of covering up Islamic attacks
[1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:51.120]  or radical leftist attacks while the leftists are all over the news saying go
[1:07:51.120 --> 1:07:54.160]  out and kill white people go out and kill Trump supporters go out and kill
[1:07:54.160 --> 1:08:01.720]  Trump it's just everywhere it's ubiquitous it's like sunshine or oxygen
[1:08:01.720 --> 1:08:06.400]  it's an ocean of threats and violence and hatred where do I walk down the
[1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:10.240]  streets and so-called liberal cities they come screaming Nazi pouring hot
[1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:17.200]  coffee on me and gibbering obscenities and it's a bunch of white folks trying
[1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:19.960]  to prove to other white folks that they really hate white people they're not
[1:08:19.960 --> 1:08:24.360]  with the white folks because they're so uncomfortable I guess racist around
[1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:28.520]  people that aren't white they've got a virtue signal to them that they're like
[1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:32.640]  them that they're their friends until it makes everybody totally uncomfortable
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:38.160]  and they turn into complete mental patients so they got a big problem
[1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:41.560]  they're the ones who are used to control the narrative in the media they
[1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:45.520]  don't anymore they're totally distrusted they're totally disdain they're
[1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:50.520]  calling for all this violence then a guy targets a mainly white country music
[1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:55.200]  venue the Democrats celebrate high-level officials at CBS News
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:59.440]  Democrat strategist Twitter saying they deserve it they're white they're
[1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:04.240]  conservative their Trump supporters good but then simultaneously oh look their
[1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:08.760]  victims turn your guns in while simultaneously saying well but they
[1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:12.040]  are gun owners a lot of them so they deserve it maybe you'll grow up now
[1:09:12.040 --> 1:09:16.720]  talk about perching on victims talk about using a crisis talk about being
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:21.520]  insensitive and evil but they're the ones that have been radicalizing they're
[1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:25.080]  the ones that have been pushing it they're the ones that have been hammering
[1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:30.720]  this over and over and over and over trying to get a civil war going they
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:36.600]  said would start in October or in November so here are the headlines on
[1:09:36.600 --> 1:09:43.920]  drudgereport.com news wars.com and info wars.com right now breaking sheriff
[1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:49.000]  Las Vegas shooter could have been radicalized they're looking into
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:55.320]  evidence of that right now forensic psychiatrist says gunmen may have been
[1:09:55.320 --> 1:09:58.960]  deliberately targeting conservatives and then walks through how much it's like
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:03.240]  this police attack and meant to overthrow the government meant to have
[1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:07.520]  special elections colonel Schaefer gunmen deliberately targeted country music
[1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:12.200]  concert to kill Trump supporters and again how CNN MSNBC and others are
[1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:18.120]  creating a radicalized conditioned climate to do so receipt shows paddock
[1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:23.240]  had another guest in his room before shooting our sources have now confirmed
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:27.640]  that it is a real receipt it is from folks inside the hotel and indeed he did
[1:10:27.640 --> 1:10:32.320]  check in at least a day before they claimed he had five days he was there
[1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:37.280]  and didn't get caught give me a break again most mass shootings linked to SSRIs
[1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:43.160]  and other drugs but MSM ignores that that's from us on Monday kit Daniels
[1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:49.840]  now today we learned he was on medication for mental problems and it said
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:55.040]  and it says on the insert it can cause you to have psychotic breaks and go out
[1:10:55.040 --> 1:11:00.480]  and kill people again we said look for radicalization that the HRT had given
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:04.440]  us the info last night the sheriff confirms they have found evidence of
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:09.640]  that that's when the sheriff comes out and says we now are looking at radicalization
[1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:13.240]  they did that day 3 of San Bernardino as well the next day we learned they were
[1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:17.160]  jihadis and then Obama had ordered a cover-up but the cover-up didn't last
[1:11:17.160 --> 1:11:21.080]  look at the target look at the venue that's the motive that's what colonel
[1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:24.160]  Schaefer has said that's what top government psychiatrists have said
[1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:30.960]  that's what all the evidence shows it's right in front of you joining us is the
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:35.320]  Motor City madman himself the omnibudsman of the Second Amendment and
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:38.840]  that of course is Ted Nugent of TedNugent.com I wish I could have you
[1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:42.000]  here on Better Times but thank you for joining us to give your knowledge and
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:47.120]  your important input into what we're facing but undoubtedly Ted we are seeing
[1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:52.400]  a full-out war declared on the Second Amendment they're going for a broke Ted
[1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:56.440]  yeah it's true Alice thanks for having me on I agree I wish it could be under
[1:11:56.440 --> 1:12:00.520]  more pleasant circumstances because it it is a wonderful time of year I'm
[1:12:00.520 --> 1:12:04.080]  spending time with great families around the hunting campfires here in the
[1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:08.400]  swamps of Michigan I just got back from Okinawa spending a week with the
[1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:14.000]  incredible US Marine Corps warriors so my spirit is on high right now but it's
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:21.440]  also shattered because of this tragic demonic violent assault and massacre in
[1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:26.360]  Las Vegas so I'm sure you have expressed that good people are looking at all the
[1:12:26.360 --> 1:12:30.800]  unlimited good that overwhelmed the bad and ugly and evil that is American
[1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:35.720]  citizens first responders and the cops and the military but just just you and
[1:12:35.720 --> 1:12:42.440]  me working hard playing hard regular old citizen Americans who became warriors
[1:12:42.440 --> 1:12:47.040]  and really saved lives and and mitigated what could have been much much worse
[1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:50.680]  because of the lessons we learned from Columbine and the heroes of law
[1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:54.880]  enforcement first responders even they be trained security at the Mandalay Bay
[1:12:54.880 --> 1:12:59.680]  there they went up there immediately to confront not regroup not organize not
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:03.760]  spend time and try to determine what's going on they saw what was going on they
[1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:09.320]  interdicted the conditions and they they saved many many lives so yes there
[1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:13.320]  isn't assault on the second amendment but I gotta tell you Alex I'm not out
[1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:16.640]  here alone not just the great men and women of the National Rifle Association
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:21.200]  but good people I'm watching Tucker Carlson and Greg Gutfeld and Newt
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:27.200]  Gingrich and a crime specialist from Australia completely destroying the
[1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:32.720]  lies and the fantasy of those that believe another gun law could have stopped
[1:13:32.720 --> 1:13:38.280]  this or any of the other mass shootings or any crime in I mean if you can't keep
[1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:45.640]  real Kalishnikov machine guns out of people's hands in Paris France then
[1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:51.440]  obviously people with any intellect and common sense whatsoever were realized
[1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:57.640]  that there's nothing you can write on paper and turn into a law or a regulation
[1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:04.600]  that would have stopped any of the mass shootings because evil is as evil does
[1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:10.840]  but we the citizens of America will not let our second amendment rights are
[1:14:10.840 --> 1:14:16.320]  God-given constitutionally guaranteed right to keep in their arms we will not
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:21.800]  let it be infringed any further and we're making a stand right here and right
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:25.880]  now we're going to break here to some moments so please stay with us again
[1:14:25.880 --> 1:14:30.200]  Ted Nugent's our guest but just briefly I have you seen the information coming
[1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:33.400]  out they're looking at radicalization our FBI sources told us Monday and it's
[1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:38.200]  now being confirmed that there was antifa and pro-islamic garbage in there
[1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:43.200]  and his live-in I guess common law wife was traveling to Dubai and other areas
[1:14:43.200 --> 1:14:48.640]  he was wiring money all over to Islamic countries this looks really bad nothing
[1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:52.920]  would surprise me at this time I believe that the law enforcement heroes of the
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:58.720]  Las Vegas our jurisdiction are literally doing the greatest job I may have
[1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:03.080]  ever witnessed in not only stopping the shooting but also the investigation but
[1:15:03.080 --> 1:15:08.120]  you're right Alex we have to be suspicious our founding fathers and all
[1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:12.000]  citizens of America who knows that this is a sacred experiment in self-government
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:17.360]  we must always be suspicious we must always question the information that

[1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:47.880]  why is it being pushed on the American public while political correctness is
[1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:51.560]  simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to
[1:16:51.560 --> 1:16:54.920]  control public opinion by controlling your opinions the establishment gets
[1:16:54.920 --> 1:16:58.560]  you to not only agree with their agenda but to also ensure that your government
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:02.760]  created viewpoint also influences others in ripple effect this is how the power
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:06.160]  elite and the government stay in power the use psychological manipulation they
[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:09.880]  turn the public into obedient sheeple and over time we lose our ability to
[1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:13.720]  distinguish reality from deception but how does political correctness and other
[1:17:13.720 --> 1:17:17.760]  deliberate deceptions work well first the establishment saturates mass media
[1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:21.440]  with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of
[1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:25.640]  popular culture and is accepted as truth such as global warming for example then
[1:17:25.640 --> 1:17:28.880]  the establishment suppresses any counter arguments through their agenda by
[1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:33.440]  calling critics kooky nut jobs racist or in the case of man-made climate change

[1:19:46.440 --> 1:19:51.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:19:51.840 --> 1:20:21.800]  the big part of shackles on us ladies and gentlemen is having
[1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:29.000]  our guns taken away and the exciting part about it is the leftist admit that
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:33.600]  all over the country they're losing and people are becoming pro-gun but there's
[1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:37.640]  a scary side to that talking to some of the gun ranges I go to they say the
[1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:43.040]  biggest new group they see are liberals but that they're not there being
[1:20:43.040 --> 1:20:46.880]  converted to the second amendment they believe that preparing for civil war with
[1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:52.520]  us so there's a total paradox here and then they won't stand for a moment of
[1:20:52.520 --> 1:20:55.400]  silence they won't they won't put their hand with their heart for the American
[1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:59.720]  flag Michelle Obama says the problem with America's are so many white people
[1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:04.280]  in government they're just pushing classical racism it's so sick and we
[1:21:04.280 --> 1:21:09.960]  have Democrats everywhere calling for revolution and so many Democrats vice
[1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:16.160]  presidents the CBS you name it saying the folks that died in Vegas deserve to die
[1:21:16.160 --> 1:21:23.000]  because they were white Republicans it's like the nastiest craziest weirdest
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:28.240]  people and they're almost all white people domesticated weird white
[1:21:28.240 --> 1:21:32.480]  executives and I don't know it's like mass mental illness that Ted Nugent's
[1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:37.520]  been talking about forever Ted Nugent dot com he joins us from Michigan Ted
[1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:41.240]  you've got the floor here in this segment the next I mean talking about the
[1:21:41.240 --> 1:21:45.280]  mental illness of these people they have no decency what's going on
[1:21:45.280 --> 1:21:50.240]  well you know thanks for the opportunity I'm not just speaking on behalf of
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:54.480]  myself as an individual or just my family I get to spend a lot of intimate
[1:21:54.480 --> 1:21:58.320]  time with great great American families especially this time of year Alex is the
[1:21:58.320 --> 1:22:02.960]  hunting season which is the ultimate conservation and environmental benefit
[1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:06.960]  that you can perform for the good mother earth that's to hunt fish and trap and
[1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:10.560]  harvest the surplus and give thanks so my point is is that the people I
[1:22:10.560 --> 1:22:14.440]  communicate with it are on a campfire literally every day September October
[1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:18.840]  November December January all mostly in Michigan and Texas but also up in
[1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:23.720]  Ontario out in California hunting camps all around these people unload they
[1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:28.800]  unleash their uninhibited around a campfire and so when I speak Alex it's
[1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:35.960]  not just my point of view it's the living breathing pulse of good Americans
[1:22:35.960 --> 1:22:42.280]  they're in the asset column and we know that when the left movement is based on
[1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:47.680]  the hands up don't shoot live they they know it's a lie but they maniacally
[1:22:47.680 --> 1:22:52.760]  cling to it for an agenda that is against freedom against America against
[1:22:52.760 --> 1:22:57.560]  rugged individualism when you have a leftist movement that's based on the
[1:22:57.560 --> 1:23:03.840]  black lives matter but they don't give a rat's ass about the death orgy in
[1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:10.440]  Chicago every day you know that it's not just disingenuous it's soulless these
[1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:15.920]  people have no soul like you mentioned it's worth repeating you have a CBS
[1:23:15.920 --> 1:23:20.640]  executive that was educated actually brainwashed by the American anti-
[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:28.840]  education system who literally spews the filth the rot the hate the demonetcy
[1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:34.640]  that the victims in Las Vegas deserved it because country fans are
[1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:39.760]  Republicans and Trump supporters Alex you couldn't write a script it's the
[1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:45.200]  sequel to planet of the apes flew over the cuckoo's nest clockwork day glow
[1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:52.920]  mad magazine hell to twilight zone and come up with more absurd offensive and
[1:23:52.920 --> 1:23:57.040]  they're getting crazier Ted that's the thing is I'm watching them when do we
[1:23:57.040 --> 1:24:00.640]  hit Pete craziness because it seems like I keep thinking we've hit Pete craziness
[1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:05.480]  and it just gets even more crazy well you know in reference to in responding to
[1:24:05.480 --> 1:24:12.640]  your your point about the left literally squaloring about a revolution and
[1:24:12.640 --> 1:24:17.920]  they're going to gun rangers and they're arming up these people I share
[1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:23.880]  campfires with the right the conservatives the Republicans the good
[1:24:23.880 --> 1:24:30.480]  people of this country will never start a revolution it will have to come from
[1:24:30.480 --> 1:24:36.040]  the hate mongers in Antifa and the liberals and the Democrats and the
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:41.320]  black lives matter terrorists and the hands-up don't shoot liars if that's
[1:24:41.320 --> 1:24:45.360]  where it comes from in Alice I don't believe it will because they have big
[1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:50.400]  mouths they have no heart they have no soul and they're consumed with hate I
[1:24:50.400 --> 1:24:55.000]  don't think they have the courage to really fight truly fight and put
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:59.400]  themselves in harm's way for the lie that they live every day so I believe
[1:24:59.400 --> 1:25:05.040]  that the the the the Republicans the conservatives we the people in the asset
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:09.240]  column of America we already have a revolution going we got Donald Trump
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:14.760]  going it is a we the people voting revolution where the apathy is slowly
[1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:19.440]  being discarded and we're taking on our response and I totally agree with you
[1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:23.920]  because we're winning the information war we're winning with Americana success
[1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:28.120]  with excellence it's spreading like wall fire so the the insanity is their
[1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:33.680]  political death row so who shoots first loses and so yes but if they do start a
[1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:36.840]  physical war I think you were about to say we're not gonna start it but we're
[1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:41.640]  gonna finish it well you know hanging out with the Marines like I did last week
[1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:47.560]  in Okinawa one of the Marines battle cries is that they'll never leave a
[1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:52.760]  brother behind and that the Marines are their greatest friends you could have and
[1:25:52.760 --> 1:25:58.760]  the worst enemies you could have and that they will take on any challenge and
[1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:03.720]  finish it and that's the kind of people I hang out with and if there is a
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:13.080]  revolution can you imagine the stone hippie punks in Antifa taken on country
[1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:16.840]  fans or rock and roll fans the conservatives the hunters the shooters
[1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:21.880]  the competitors there the gun nuts can you imagine the quick end that would
[1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:25.680]  come to that confrontation well that's what's crazy they admit they're trying
[1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:30.160]  to intimidate us and they take our our kindness for weakness and our restraint
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:33.040]  for weakness but we're just getting more politically involved as they get more
[1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:37.040]  violent and beating them and it's exposing them and even Pelosi has to
[1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:39.880]  admit they're a terror group and now they're being listed as a terror group
[1:26:39.880 --> 1:26:44.520]  we're cleaning their clocks that's why it's so important we continue to be
[1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:49.200]  peaceful and hold our fire even as it comes out that this guy was connected to
[1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:54.600]  Antifa and Islamist and it's a horrible thing they did but we're winning and so
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:27:00.160]  it's key to stay nonviolent offensively yes we should defend ourselves like the
[1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:05.560]  HRT and the police did when they killed this guy absolutely and the most
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:10.960]  important thing I can say and this cannot be overstated an American who
[1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:15.520]  believes in peace and security and freedom has got to me a member of the
[1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:20.600]  National Rifle Association that is the the force of we the people remember the
[1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:25.760]  National Rifle Association is simply a family grassroots organizations that
[1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:30.560]  will not allow our Second Amendment rights to be infringed that's all the
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:34.640]  NRA is it's we the people it's good citizens of this country the globalists
[1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:39.760]  know it that's why that's why Hillary that's why co-bear that's why all the
[1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:44.680]  usual Obermann said quote that the NRA is a terror organization that needs to be
[1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:50.000]  outlawed so they're saying gun owners are terrorists now well my response to the
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:54.400]  late night so-called comedians that aren't funny at all they say we have to
[1:27:54.400 --> 1:27:57.120]  do something we just have to do something they throw their hands up and
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:01.240]  they say we have to do something well Alex you know throwing a cinder block to
[1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:05.800]  a drowning child is something yes it's the wrong thing we don't need to do
[1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:10.880]  something we need to do the right thing well Jimmy Kimmel has five to seven
[1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:15.760]  bodyguards with with guns at all times it's on video but he says some poor you
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:20.440]  know sheet worker you know a metal worker can't have a shotgun to protect
[1:28:20.440 --> 1:28:24.280]  right there one more segment with Ted Nugent straight ahead we're gonna talk
[1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:27.720]  about the revolution restore the Republic and what the panic left will do
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:32.080]  next try to stop us we got him in a stranglehold know that for sure we'll
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:44.200]  be back it was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking
[1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:47.760]  so steady a course as to show by what rodeo will pass the destruction to wit
[1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:52.080]  by consolidation of power first and then corruption it's necessary consequence
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:55.960]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite the 1% of the 1%
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:28:59.600]  consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:03.280]  government unfortunately we didn't heed his advice and now live in a neo
[1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:07.080]  feudalistic society which were treated as indentured servants who only exist to
[1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:10.400]  serve the needs of the establishment political office no longer represents
[1:29:10.400 --> 1:29:13.720]  the voice of the people but rather the initiation process politicians go
[1:29:13.720 --> 1:29:17.680]  through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy simply put it we the people
[1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:21.360]  are responsible for civilization culture yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite
[1:29:21.360 --> 1:29:24.160]  who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the
[1:29:24.160 --> 1:29:28.160]  world we falsely believe that everything is simply black and white one extreme
[1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:31.480]  against the other conservative versus liberal but things will change once
[1:29:31.480 --> 1:29:35.120]  more of us realize this truth as Thomas Jefferson also said in light of the
[1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:38.200]  people generally in tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will
[1:29:38.200 --> 1:29:41.960]  vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day this is Kit Daniels with info wars

[1:31:45.520 --> 1:31:49.840]  a voracious consumer of news and information and in the last four or
[1:31:49.840 --> 1:31:54.040]  five years doing more and more research I came across the fact that the elite
[1:31:54.040 --> 1:31:58.720]  establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many
[1:31:58.720 --> 1:32:03.680]  cases had much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought
[1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:07.680]  out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then
[1:32:07.680 --> 1:32:13.000]  processing and so I set out to develop caveman but to not just have concentrated

[1:32:45.160 --> 1:33:07.440]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show coming to you from the former United
[1:33:07.440 --> 1:33:15.560]  States of America from deep in the heart of Texas it's Alex Jones yeah that's a
[1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:19.080]  liner from about six years ago basically pointing out that Obama was
[1:33:19.080 --> 1:33:23.440]  destroying America and turning it into like a world government UN globalist
[1:33:23.440 --> 1:33:28.680]  hellhole but now that intro is almost obsolete not the great stranglehold with
[1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:32.960]  the great Ted Nugent ringing us in but the fact that we're in FEMA region six
[1:33:32.960 --> 1:33:36.840]  under global control we're out of the TPP our borders are getting secured we're
[1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:41.160]  trying to take care of our military the stock markets up we've got a 3% growth
[1:33:41.160 --> 1:33:46.200]  rate going on that they said Trump could never do and that's with only a little
[1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:50.320]  bit of the make America great again agenda in place then they tried to
[1:33:50.320 --> 1:33:54.120]  claim he didn't respond well to Puerto Rico when the Democrats got caught
[1:33:54.120 --> 1:34:00.040]  ordering a stand down by the unions I mean again the level of their evil is
[1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:04.360]  only outmatched by their arrogance in the fact that they think they're
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:09.520]  invincible what's wrong with these punks Ted Nugent well you know you say the
[1:34:09.520 --> 1:34:13.320]  former United States of America I hear from my buddies in New York New Jersey
[1:34:13.320 --> 1:34:17.920]  Maryland Massachusetts Rhode Island Delaware Illinois California those
[1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:24.640]  states that I just mentioned Alex it is not America anymore they have no second
[1:34:24.640 --> 1:34:30.720]  amendment they can't keep or bear squat and I gotta tell you they're heartbroken
[1:34:30.720 --> 1:34:34.120]  people are leaving California in Illinois by the droves because they're
[1:34:34.120 --> 1:34:38.120]  looking for freedom they're looking for the founding fathers vision of we the
[1:34:38.120 --> 1:34:44.960]  people and I gotta tell you I mean my travels thank God the curse the
[1:34:44.960 --> 1:34:49.600]  self-inflicted scourge of apathy is being whittled away and by electing
[1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:53.520]  Donald Trump and otherwise known as reliably blue states of Michigan
[1:34:53.520 --> 1:34:58.640]  Wisconsin Pennsylvania for example the prognosis is quite good actually
[1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:03.800]  following eight years of anti-Americanism and the Benghazi and the lies and the
[1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:08.640]  deceit the gun-running fast and furious murder of American citizens and border
[1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:13.320]  patrol agents by our own government it really is heartbreaking and catastrophic
[1:35:13.320 --> 1:35:18.320]  but again I really have faith in my fellow Americans the spirit and the
[1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:24.360]  indefatigable energy that that we the people are now once again displaying and
[1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:28.520]  again it manifests itself in voting for Donald Trump because he's an outsider
[1:35:28.520 --> 1:35:33.120]  he's a status quo crusher and all things status quo have to be crushed now
[1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:37.400]  that's why I admire what you do Alex Jones if you crush the status quo when
[1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:41.240]  you spotlight cockroaches and you ask questions and we're demanding
[1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:46.440]  constitutional accountability from our elected employees so the swamp hasn't
[1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:50.640]  been drained it's a merc fest out there but certainly the prognosis is better
[1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:54.320]  than you and I witnessed in the last eight years well we also had these
[1:35:54.320 --> 1:35:58.520]  Democrats as you mentioned earlier off air to me that refused to stand for the
[1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:03.560]  moment of silence and said it was wrong and then you have the NFL trying to
[1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:09.040]  bully Trump into saying you know that it's okay to not stand for the pledge of
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:12.280]  allegiance or put your hand over your heart now the NFL's had to back down the
[1:36:12.280 --> 1:36:16.640]  NBA has they're finding out the true power of America Trump said it's not
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:20.360]  appropriate and is disrespectful to our veterans in our country to do that and
[1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:26.240]  they said no you're disrespecting the NFL that was the head of the NFL he had to
[1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:30.080]  back down pretty quick but again we're winning but the arrogance of these
[1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:34.640]  people is frightening so remember it was the NFL too that that literally
[1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:39.000]  continued the lie of hands up don't shoot this there hasn't been any hands up
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:42.960]  don't shoot never happened it's a lie and these group balls he's uneducated
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:48.600]  spoiled overpaid brats they've obviously the the concussions are already
[1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:53.360]  happening at a fast rate because you have to have a concussion your brain has
[1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:59.600]  to be wounded and bloodshot to perpetrate and continue the lie of hands up
[1:36:59.600 --> 1:37:03.080]  don't shoot these clowns came out in the field with their hands up don't shoot
[1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:07.960]  lie going on so when you've got that level of ignorance and you know there's
[1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:11.440]  a difference between ignorance and stupidity when I go to the Indian
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:16.080] apolis 500 I'm ignorant about how to tune a Cogsworth engine because I don't
[1:37:16.080 --> 1:37:20.120]  know that much about the mechanics of indie race engines I'm ignorant about it
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:24.480]  but what's stupid is to protect that ignorant ignorance and not allow
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:28.280]  information to come in so that you're not ignorant anymore these people like
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:32.120]  their ignorance they fantasize about their ignorance ignorance is about
[1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:37.280]  feeling good instead of doing good in the NFL dirt bags
[1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:41.840]  manifest that you're right they wear their ignorance like a cloak of
[1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:47.920]  invincibility it's unbelievable I mean they're supposed to be anti-fascist and
[1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:52.520]  they I got a couple things I gotta share with you so you're anti-fascist so
[1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:58.560]  you use fascist tech techniques you're you're occupied Wall Street but you got
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:04.160]  to your protest by using Wall Street transportation wearing Wall Street clothes
[1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:10.600]  eating Wall Street food and using Wall Street handheld device yes you can
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:15.400]  protest Wall Street I mean this is planet these people have to be on acid
[1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:21.280]  do they put LSD on their Cheerios you have to be brain dead and protect that
[1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:27.280]  stupidity to a maniacal degree to not know that your protest in the system by
[1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:33.840]  which you have life Wow Ted Nugent is on fire your smart guy family guy
[1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:38.200]  successful of business not just one of the top guitarists out there in history
[1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:43.160]  but as libertarians as conservatives as patriots as Americana we need to look
[1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:46.760]  into the future they've only gotten more radical they've only got more crazy
[1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:50.520]  they've been calling for an October November surprise all the experts are
[1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:54.040]  saying this guy is the same cut out as the loon that went and shot Scalise and
[1:38:54.040 --> 1:38:58.080]  others who wanted a special election he wanted to kill 15 members of Congress at
[1:38:58.080 --> 1:39:02.200]  least and that even came out on Fox yesterday so Scalise has come out and
[1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:05.480]  said he believes more in the Second Amendment now than ever because it was
[1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:08.840]  guns that helped save him but they're going to double down they're going to

[1:52:47.960 --> 1:52:51.680]  was up all night gathering information regarding these receipts there's a
[1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:56.520]  Hispanic room service employee at the Mandalay Hotel who made a Facebook post
[1:52:56.520 --> 1:53:01.400]  in which he as you can see on the screen right there he he showed pictures of the
[1:53:01.400 --> 1:53:07.680]  receipts from Stephen Paddock's room and as you can see from the receipt it says
[1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:15.320]  in-room dining MB so it's IRD MB and then it's three two one three five which
[1:53:15.320 --> 1:53:21.520]  stands for room 135 on the 32nd floor and it says that he had two guests so
[1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:25.880]  this goes against everything that the FBI and the Las Vegas Police Department
[1:53:25.880 --> 1:53:29.040]  has been reporting to the American people in the public in which they said
[1:53:29.040 --> 1:53:33.160]  that he was alone in his room and didn't have a guest and then they also they
[1:53:33.160 --> 1:53:37.560]  also told us that he checked in on the 28th but if you look at the date on the
[1:53:37.560 --> 1:53:43.960]  receipt it says the 27th and my sources a source who has access to the booking
[1:53:43.960 --> 1:53:48.440]  information and employee at the Mandalay Resort Hotel you had already said
[1:53:48.440 --> 1:53:54.160]  this yesterday on my show and published it before this even came out yes that the
[1:53:54.160 --> 1:54:00.000]  shooter checked into the hotel on the 25th so I don't know why I mean there's
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:03.720]  obviously a cover-up going on here the FBI now we know why there's Hispanic
[1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:06.760]  folks that were probably working in the hotel warning people saying get out of
[1:54:06.760 --> 1:54:10.360]  here you're about to die because the hotel had to know he's there with five
[1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:15.760]  days 22 guns all the ammo two rooms cameras outside the room I mean security
[1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:20.680]  be there in five minutes right and so you know I've been I've been trying to
[1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:25.200]  tell people over the past 24 hours that the shooter has been inside that suite
[1:54:25.200 --> 1:54:30.400]  since the 25th of September but for some reason the FBI and the Las Vegas Police
[1:54:30.400 --> 1:54:34.240]  Department has been lying and deceiving the American public why don't they want
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:38.800]  us to know that he checked in three days earlier why it's just it's mind-blowing
[1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:42.200]  and they were caught in their own tracks lying I mean receipts do not lie
[1:54:42.200 --> 1:54:47.680]  there's a time stamp and it says two guests with the room number and the the
[1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:52.320]  floor of the hotel and they're caught lying just like 9-11 they had Muslims
[1:54:52.320 --> 1:54:55.800]  running around New York it was in major newspapers shang those towers won't be
[1:54:55.800 --> 1:55:00.120]  there on this on the 11th there there are people that knew here because he was
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:05.400]  preparing with a huge arsenal for five days thank God that the again the
[1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:08.720]  Hispanic workers were running around warning everyone and now they're
[1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:14.760]  posting a stuff receipts yeah no exactly and he posted it in Spanish if you
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:20.000]  look at my original tweet and and the picture that Paul Joseph Watson posted
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:25.160]  it's in Spanish and I speak Spanish so I translated it and it says it goes along
[1:55:25.160 --> 1:55:30.720]  but you had the hotel worker that ran the data we've had folks inside of that
[1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:33.240]  before as well this is real investigative journalism you were already
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:37.160]  reporting this before the receipt service this is incredible yeah but my
[1:55:37.160 --> 1:55:40.520]  reporting suggests it's even two days earlier than the receipts the receipts
[1:55:40.520 --> 1:55:45.280]  are saying the 27th but my intel and my sources who work at the Mandalay
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:49.800]  Resort are saying the 25th and I'm just saying stay tuned for today's presser
[1:55:49.800 --> 1:55:53.880]  because Donald Trump you know he had a very dismal tone this morning when he
[1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:56.640]  was speaking to the media and said there's more information that's coming
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:00.400]  out and we've learned a lot and it's a very sad day for me and I have a feeling
[1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:03.960]  that a lot of the information that I've been reporting and that you've been
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:08.520]  reporting here at Info Wars is going to be confirmed and you know we're going
[1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:13.840]  to be vindicated today by the president and by this presser because they can't
[1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:18.200]  lie any longer and I'm also being told that you know other sources have
[1:56:18.200 --> 1:56:25.080]  confirmed my my my date of September 25th well this is so dangerous I just
[1:56:25.080 --> 1:56:28.400]  want people to know this this is the real deal we're involved in the hostage
[1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:32.320]  rescue team was so concerned they let us know within hours that no Alex this is
[1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:37.880]  bull there's antifa stuff inside there's more her going to Islamic countries
[1:56:37.880 --> 1:56:43.400]  that came out later this something there's a huge cover-up Laura and also
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:48.440]  too I don't know if people caught this but the lost the Las Vegas police
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:53.720]  department they said originally that she was in Tokyo after it was reported
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:56:56.600]  that she was in the Philippines and then the reports are coming in this morning
[1:56:56.600 --> 1:57:00.120]  that she landed around midnight from the Philippines so why are they telling us
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:03.280]  that she's in Tokyo when she was actually in the Philippines which is being
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:08.920]  ravaged by ISIS and then the sister of Mary Lou Delaney or whatever her name
[1:57:08.920 --> 1:57:16.000]  is she came on today and she said oh Stephen Paddock had her sent away so
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:20.400]  that she wouldn't interfere with what he was planning that's right it's all
[1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:24.720]  coming together and all this money millions of dollars is the anti-foot

[1:59:54.320 --> 2:00:02.240]  to you live from the front lines of the info war so eric paddock steven paddock
[2:00:02.240 --> 2:00:10.440]  the supposed shooter or the decoys my brother has changed the story 180 it's
[2:00:10.440 --> 2:00:16.640]  complete 180 from north to south from east to west upside down world he just
[2:00:16.640 --> 2:00:20.880]  said oh no guns never involved anything you know just a normal person blah blah
[2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:25.520]  forget his intelligence agency cut out and all the rest of it millions of
[2:00:25.520 --> 2:00:29.000]  dollars and Islamic you know girlfriends that have two husbands and world
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:33.920]  travelers and these people look either like some type of crux or intelligence
[2:00:33.920 --> 2:00:40.080]  agency people and now the brother has totally 180 this okay and I must think
[2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:44.840]  they look like that the MO looks like that and oh yes he did it 100% he did
[2:00:44.840 --> 2:00:51.080]  it he did it here is the bizarre back-to-back video I mean my brother did this I
[2:00:51.080 --> 2:00:59.280]  this is like it was done you know like he shot us I mean if he had killed my
[2:00:59.280 --> 2:01:06.440]  kids I couldn't be more this guy's the worst actor I mean it doesn't so last
[2:01:06.440 --> 2:01:10.280]  there's nothing of course Steve did this all by him this is 100% Steve did this by
[2:01:10.280 --> 2:01:15.440]  himself people can't seem to cope with that either but Steve is a was was a
[2:01:15.440 --> 2:01:23.120]  highly intelligent highly successful person he could have done anything he
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:30.000]  wanted to do and he did he made himself wealthy he made us wealthy he was a very
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:36.880]  successful person he gambled for 20 plus years successfully it's like a job to
[2:01:36.880 --> 2:01:42.720]  him he did it mathematically he did it because it was a way to have a fun life
[2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:50.400]  and and make and he didn't go poor doing it so he didn't ever do any of it now he
[2:01:50.400 --> 2:01:55.000]  did it all this guy is central casting the squirreliest person I've ever seen
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:59.360]  the dad was a psychopath according to the FBI bank robber that tried to run
[2:01:59.360 --> 2:02:05.200]  FBI agents over I mean these guys this whole family is like demonic muppets or
[2:02:05.200 --> 2:02:09.280]  something from what I've seen Laura Lemmer what in the hell excuse me what
[2:02:09.280 --> 2:02:13.000]  are you things going on here Alex you just missed a really big part of this
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:16.240]  interview with the brother as he was talking it sounded like he had an ear
[2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:20.320]  piece in his ear and he said Steve was in arms and it it sounded like he was
[2:02:20.320 --> 2:02:23.800]  about to say arms dealer or something and then they cut him off and then he
[2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:27.320]  realizes his mistake and then he says he's sorry so you should definitely go
[2:02:27.320 --> 2:02:31.680]  back and play that footage because that is very suspicious given the fact that
[2:02:31.680 --> 2:02:36.640]  he had all of these these weapons and other properties well that's where funny
[2:02:36.640 --> 2:02:40.440]  you say that that's where Millie's going is this was an arms deal gone bad with
[2:02:40.440 --> 2:02:45.000]  jihadis that they set him up and that they then did the shooting and then the
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:48.480]  and then that's what happened but listen to that audio that you just played
[2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:51.320]  again because I was listening and I think you just missed one of the parts
[2:02:51.320 --> 2:02:55.920]  where it almost looks like he has something in his ear and he said Steve
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:02:59.640]  wasn't arms and then he realizes his mistake and of course I'm looking at
[2:02:59.640 --> 2:03:03.640]  that in the clip I just played or a clip you have it's a clip it's the same
[2:03:03.640 --> 2:03:08.160]  interview that you showed but I don't think you isolated the correct part but
[2:03:08.160 --> 2:03:10.920]  yeah I was just showing him saying my brother didn't do anything my brother
[2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:14.480]  did everything I was just showing the contradiction but yeah send them the
[2:03:14.480 --> 2:03:20.360]  clip or or the part of the clipper how long is the whole clip guys 33 minutes
[2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:24.320]  Laura can you send them the clip you want played I'll send it right now it's
[2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:27.200]  just the 10-second clip it's very quick yeah can you send to Nika or you was
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:35.240]  said to me yeah I'll text it right now I mean this is just how fast everything
[2:03:35.240 --> 2:03:38.400]  is changing you know like live time updates on the cell phone having a
[2:03:38.400 --> 2:03:41.560]  report I mean I can't even begin to explain how many times I've had to
[2:03:41.560 --> 2:03:44.200]  charge my phone and it just keeps jamming and jamming and jamming because
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:47.920]  you just can't get this much information out there's just by the way
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:51.440]  let me stop right there you have a rule guys when you pop in I want you to be on
[2:03:51.440 --> 2:03:58.120]  air were you just on air Matt just Matt just pointed out he says 30 plus times
[2:03:58.120 --> 2:04:03.200]  my brother acts alone he's clearly does have an earpiece they're talking in it
[2:04:03.200 --> 2:04:07.160]  you can see it's happening like Laura just said and he's just parroting
[2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:12.120]  talking points the worst actor this is a total cover up this is a Democratic
[2:04:12.120 --> 2:04:16.320]  Party production I will say it they did it they've been calling for a civil war
[2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:19.440]  they've been calling to kill conservatives they won our guns they're
[2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:23.280]  completely obvious and they're just it's incredible Laura Limmer stay there
[2:04:23.280 --> 2:04:29.400]  hey wow we're gonna get the clip she's talking about this is insane and I want
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:32.080]  to isolate that clip as soon as we can and get it on on Twitter so people can
[2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:36.400]  share it because it that's where we were already going in 30 minutes was the arms
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:40.520]  dealing I have it right here in my notes
[2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:46.520]  we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they
[2:04:46.520 --> 2:04:50.520]  are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these
[2:04:50.520 --> 2:04:54.440]  are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights
[2:04:54.440 --> 2:04:58.720]  governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the
[2:04:58.720 --> 2:05:02.480]  consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes
[2:05:02.480 --> 2:05:06.760]  destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to
[2:05:06.760 --> 2:05:13.240]  abolish and to institute new government independence isn't a day it's a
[2:05:13.240 --> 2:05:17.760]  mindset an attitude that says I will not be your dependent I will not be your
[2:05:17.760 --> 2:05:22.680]  slave dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with
[2:05:22.680 --> 2:05:27.600]  gradual infringements when you trade your liberty for safety to that extent you
[2:05:27.600 --> 2:05:33.520]  become their slave slaves are never safe you won't get rich by being a slave
[2:05:33.520 --> 2:05:38.280]  guard your liberty regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it
[2:05:38.280 --> 2:05:43.960]  for infowars.com I'm David Dyke
[2:05:57.960 --> 2:06:05.240]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the
[2:06:05.240 --> 2:06:10.880]  infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[2:06:16.120 --> 2:06:21.520]  ladies and gentlemen I already have sources in the hostage rescue team that
[2:06:21.520 --> 2:06:26.720]  told us on Monday morning this is all bull he had Antifa and Islamic literature
[2:06:26.720 --> 2:06:33.600]  and his common law wife was being sent around the Middle East and that they
[2:06:33.600 --> 2:06:37.160]  were looking into it the official story that there was no motive was total bull
[2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:41.320]  and they were getting ready to blame the Second Amendment I called CIA people
[2:06:41.320 --> 2:06:45.600]  current and former I called federal marshals I called well I didn't have to
[2:06:45.600 --> 2:06:51.520]  call I got called HRT people I mean I had a lot of sources obviously and now
[2:06:51.520 --> 2:06:55.800]  it's all happening just like I was told at 8 30 in the morning by one of my
[2:06:55.800 --> 2:06:59.680]  high-level CIA sources is they tried with the NFL they tried with the statues
[2:06:59.680 --> 2:07:03.400]  they tried with Charlottesville they've now attacked this crowd of right-wingers
[2:07:03.400 --> 2:07:09.800]  to then invoke going after the guns then my sources start telling me this a day
[2:07:09.800 --> 2:07:13.320]  ago and then our investigative journalist Millie Weaver gets on the trail she
[2:07:13.320 --> 2:07:17.960]  has a whole list of notes here she gave me this morning where it was a weapon
[2:07:17.960 --> 2:07:22.440]  sting gone bad that he was hooked into intelligence agencies we know he worked
[2:07:22.440 --> 2:07:26.920]  for Lockheed and the skunk works and then he got set up and double crossed and
[2:07:26.920 --> 2:07:31.120]  that's why the police are lying about what day he got there two days earlier
[2:07:31.120 --> 2:07:34.880]  as our investigative journalist have gotten into the computers you know there
[2:07:34.880 --> 2:07:39.720]  and talked to the sources inside have checked that so this is a total
[2:07:39.720 --> 2:07:48.440]  information war and now in the 30-minute interview he says 37 times that he acted
[2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:53.800]  alone 27 times no motive I mean and he's got a near piece clearly he's going oh
[2:07:53.800 --> 2:07:58.720]  sorry yeah okay this is the worst acting he goes from Monday saying his
[2:07:58.720 --> 2:08:03.400]  brother didn't do it and had no guns do he had it he had guns he acted alone I
[2:08:03.400 --> 2:08:09.960]  mean this is the worst scripting I've ever seen the attacks real the 59 people
[2:08:09.960 --> 2:08:13.360]  dead is real that's all real I've seen their off footage I talked to first
[2:08:13.360 --> 2:08:16.640]  responders the media is trying to spin that claim we're saying that's total
[2:08:16.640 --> 2:08:20.480]  bull that's another sigh up to confuse people they called for a revolution in
[2:08:20.480 --> 2:08:24.120]  October they're trying to trigger it they're making their move hoping you
[2:08:24.120 --> 2:08:27.800]  trigger other mass shootings that's what Colonel Schaefer has said from his CIA
[2:08:27.800 --> 2:08:31.400]  sources days after I first broke it I'm only saying the point is we're not
[2:08:31.400 --> 2:08:35.280]  making this up Schaefer has now said it you've got the top psychiatrist that
[2:08:35.280 --> 2:08:38.040]  works for the federal government who's examined all this saying it's a
[2:08:38.040 --> 2:08:42.040]  Democrat plan to overthrow the government to have special elections he's
[2:08:42.040 --> 2:08:45.640]  now getting death threats folks after him he's gonna stop at that the sheriff's
[2:08:45.640 --> 2:08:48.960]  come out and said we are looking at radicalization so we're gonna get you
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:52.080]  that clip that Laura just talked about we're getting it right now she just
[2:08:52.080 --> 2:08:56.880]  tweeted it at Laura Loomer we're gonna retweet it at Alex Jones there on
[2:08:56.880 --> 2:09:01.380]  Twitter as well where he's talking about gun-running gun-running and then gets
[2:09:01.380 --> 2:09:05.240]  it wrong it's just funny because at the bottom of the hour that's where I was
[2:09:05.240 --> 2:09:08.280]  going the big news I said would be at the end of the third hour at the start
[2:09:08.280 --> 2:09:13.000]  of the show we were Laura didn't even know that that's where we were going and
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:16.400]  then there's a raw tape we're playing where he's saying it so we're gonna go
[2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:20.760]  back to that as soon as we get the clip they're gonna let me know so Craig
[2:09:20.760 --> 2:09:27.280]  Sawyer former highly decorated Navy SEAL Marine before that great Patriot host
[2:09:27.280 --> 2:09:31.440]  TV shows discovery channel history channel you name it top shot Craig Sawyer
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:37.480]  tacticalinsider.com vetsforchildrescue.org joining us writing shotgun to
[2:09:37.480 --> 2:09:42.440]  give us his approximation of this they're saying there's no motive the motive is
[2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:46.800]  target Christian conservatives target Trump supporters and that has the the
[2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:51.080]  relish of turning around and using it against the Second Amendment and using
[2:09:51.080 --> 2:09:56.080]  it against the very victims this whole thing stinks to high heaven Craig Sawyer
[2:09:56.080 --> 2:10:02.360]  is a former SEAL team leader what do you make of this whole situation well from
[2:10:02.360 --> 2:10:06.040]  a federal criminal investigator standpoint Alex that's right you got that
[2:10:06.040 --> 2:10:11.480]  as a former current federal officer I forgot yeah now when when you we
[2:10:11.480 --> 2:10:16.040]  consider motive you look at who benefits and that's the first thought that I I
[2:10:16.040 --> 2:10:20.520]  had certainly the shooter did not benefit he didn't know those people that he
[2:10:20.520 --> 2:10:25.920]  was shooting up and he if he took his own life which I don't believe now then
[2:10:25.920 --> 2:10:30.360]  what benefit was that to him he could have just killed himself and left
[2:10:30.360 --> 2:10:34.880]  everybody else out of it so he didn't benefit so who benefits well I see people
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:40.160]  that are already preaching what thereafter right on his heels Hillary
[2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:44.240]  Clinton and the others the gun grabbers they're the ones that are looking to
[2:10:44.240 --> 2:10:48.040]  benefit so I would look at them first as far as motive and they're who do they
[2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:52.240]  serve what agenda are they on and you're tracking on it Alex it's a big
[2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:55.880]  global agenda for control over the United States that we've got to look
[2:10:55.880 --> 2:11:00.520]  deeper there to find out why this keeps happening and look who owns the hotel
[2:11:00.520 --> 2:11:07.280]  serious hardcore Antifa George Soros connected Muslim extremist care
[2:11:07.280 --> 2:11:10.640]  organization that maybe listed as a terror group I mean they they are heavy
[2:11:10.640 --> 2:11:15.560]  fundraisers heavily involved five days he's in there with all these guns all
[2:11:15.560 --> 2:11:19.080]  these weapons folks are running around in the crowd saying get out of here you're
[2:11:19.080 --> 2:11:22.960]  about to die I mean Craig this was executed pretty sloppily but in a
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:27.360]  place they thought they had protection yeah you know tactically it doesn't make
[2:11:27.360 --> 2:11:31.720]  any sense for him to have had that many weapons if he wanted to do a lot of harm
[2:11:31.720 --> 2:11:35.360]  I could understand him having several weapons in case one failed in a lot of
[2:11:35.360 --> 2:11:39.400]  ammunition they want to try out every configuration in front of Congress and
[2:11:39.400 --> 2:11:44.200]  ban every single one of them yeah yeah this was a political hit jobs what it
[2:11:44.200 --> 2:11:48.800]  was as much as an assault on those those precious victims there this was an
[2:11:48.800 --> 2:11:54.840]  assault on our Constitution and it's I think it's it's readily apparent what
[2:11:54.840 --> 2:12:00.440]  they're after with the gun grabbing and I think we've got to we've got to have an
[2:12:00.440 --> 2:12:04.640]  honest look you know some people are taking a calmer approach saying look if
[2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:09.760]  we want honest and genuine solutions let's look at why this is happening that's
[2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:14.320]  my thing is why does this keep happening not the howl because look crazy
[2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:19.360]  people go on mass murder benches with trucks with bombs with knives with
[2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:23.200]  chemicals with poison with anything that they can get their hand but it's the
[2:12:23.200 --> 2:12:27.520]  season we're in right now we're in the season of political overthrow the
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:31.360]  Democrats have said they were going to do this starting October 1st I was on
[2:12:31.360 --> 2:12:39.680]  air Sunday night saying I'm surprised the mass shooting hasn't started today look
[2:12:39.680 --> 2:12:44.200]  at look at look at you folks like Colonel Shaffer who has all his big
[2:12:44.200 --> 2:12:50.040]  sources he's saying this is basically a Democratic Party generated operation just
[2:12:50.040 --> 2:12:53.680]  by them calling for the violence the target tells you the motive the media
[2:12:53.680 --> 2:12:57.160]  being ready to go after the Second Amendment this as you said Craig this
[2:12:57.160 --> 2:13:00.880]  really smells as politically motivated we found the clip that Laura Loomer has
[2:13:00.880 --> 2:13:06.360]  tweeted out we were retweeting it that real Alex Jones right now here he is the
[2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:12.760]  brother of the reported shooter clearly going off a statement repeating like a
[2:13:12.760 --> 2:13:18.240]  parrot the same thing over and over again but then he slips up and says this
[2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:23.600]  I'm sorry I mean that's the thing I shouldn't have said but that's what
[2:13:23.600 --> 2:13:29.080]  people are I mean that he's this you know but he's a highly intelligent what I
[2:13:29.080 --> 2:13:32.240]  mean there's absolutely no and this is the other part that I want to stress with
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:35.440]  this that it doesn't I mean it doesn't matter that they won't chase people but
[2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:40.480]  people are saying oh you must have had help Steve had no help Steve didn't take
[2:13:40.480 --> 2:13:47.320]  help it did not take a village for Steve Steve was an arm I'm sorry please
[2:13:47.320 --> 2:13:53.240]  don't I'm using a colloquial I was about to use a colloquial term that would this
[2:13:53.240 --> 2:14:03.120]  much one of the armed forces Steve was a I just covered one guy Steve if if you
[2:14:03.120 --> 2:14:08.120]  wanted to hang out with Steve this guy's wearing an earpiece for sure Craig
[2:14:08.120 --> 2:14:12.960]  watching this as I also a federal officer in clandestine stuff I mean what
[2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:16.760]  do you make of this this is just insane yeah it looks like he caught himself or
[2:14:16.760 --> 2:14:19.720]  somebody caught him in his in his earpiece saying hey whoa whoa what are
[2:14:19.720 --> 2:14:26.560]  you easy there but look we have to be intelligent enough as a society the
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:31.240]  American citizens to realize what our global enemies want they need us
[2:14:31.240 --> 2:14:36.360]  divided and disarmed in order to put us under their ultimate control and they've
[2:14:36.360 --> 2:14:40.440]  got a lot of control already but to finish it off they need us divided and
[2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:46.200]  disarmed and we must not play into it so we you we need to unite and I would say
[2:14:46.200 --> 2:14:49.960]  to people that are kneeling that are rioting that are wearing masks that are
[2:14:49.960 --> 2:14:54.120]  attacking innocent families to shut them up you're you're unwitting
[2:14:54.120 --> 2:14:59.320]  accomplices you're helping our enemies by fueling that division you've seen how
[2:14:59.320 --> 2:15:03.400]  many Democrats Craig have openly celebrated saying good they're a bunch
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:07.640]  of white Trump supporters they deserve to die the vice president of CBS said it
[2:15:07.640 --> 2:15:12.600]  I've got like six seven articles today Trudeau said it's white supremacist the
[2:15:12.600 --> 2:15:17.760]  problem well to joke to Joe Biden I would say hey yeah let's have a
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:21.720]  conversation Joe but let's have a conversation about why you're demographic
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:26.760]  by why your political party voters are the ones committing all the mass murder

[2:19:42.840 --> 2:19:49.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:19:49.960 --> 2:19:51.960]  you
[2:20:12.280 --> 2:20:17.320]  alex jones here back live broadcasting worldwide and what we know right now is
[2:20:17.320 --> 2:20:22.120]  the official story of lost vegas is his phony is a three dollar bill
[2:20:22.120 --> 2:20:25.720]  they don't want to tell us who really did it our law enforcement sources said
[2:20:25.720 --> 2:20:29.480]  they're looking at radicalization because of anti-fun other literature there
[2:20:29.480 --> 2:20:33.320]  now the vegas sheriff's department saying yes they're going down that path
[2:20:33.320 --> 2:20:36.600]  because of some things they found and then it's shocking to them
[2:20:36.600 --> 2:20:38.920]  we're looking for trump's statement coming up soon
[2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:42.520]  craig soyer also is a weapons expert i wanted to get his take on
[2:20:42.520 --> 2:20:45.960]  does it sound like one shooter or two shooters i know there's echoes and
[2:20:45.960 --> 2:20:49.800]  things i've talked to some other green beret special forces folks
[2:20:49.800 --> 2:20:52.920]  they say it sounds like multiple shooters to them
[2:20:52.920 --> 2:20:56.520]  but acoustically i know it's hard to scientifically pin that down
[2:20:56.520 --> 2:21:17.080]  here's some of that audio
[2:21:39.480 --> 2:21:43.320]  okay ladies and gentlemen going back to craig soyer for the rest of this segment
[2:21:43.320 --> 2:21:45.800]  the law alarm is going to continue with the big breakdown
[2:21:45.800 --> 2:21:49.000]  with us with millie weaver coming up the next segment craig you're a weapons
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:52.360]  expert you you hear what's going on with that audio
[2:21:52.360 --> 2:21:55.160]  talked a lot of other experts they say they're suspicious about it
[2:21:55.160 --> 2:21:59.560]  what do you think well it does sound like multiple shooters alex
[2:21:59.560 --> 2:22:03.960]  but keep in mind an urban environment anytime you get contact in an urban
[2:22:03.960 --> 2:22:08.360]  environment it's it's very very confusing though the echo is
[2:22:08.360 --> 2:22:11.480]  overwhelming you can't necessarily tell which direction it's coming from
[2:22:11.480 --> 2:22:14.520]  because of that echo and you can't always tell how many
[2:22:14.520 --> 2:22:18.120]  shooters there are because of that so it's it is difficult tricky but i will
[2:22:18.120 --> 2:22:21.800]  say even with that considered this does sound like multiple shooters
[2:22:21.800 --> 2:22:25.560]  because of the different pitch the different frequency and and different
[2:22:25.560 --> 2:22:29.720]  tempo of a couple of the the the strings of fire there
[2:22:29.720 --> 2:22:32.920]  so one thing to consider too is those slide fire
[2:22:32.920 --> 2:22:37.720]  mechanisms do allow for a variance in in rate of fire so
[2:22:37.720 --> 2:22:42.040]  in one of those strings of fire you hear the the the around slowing
[2:22:42.040 --> 2:22:46.280]  as as the end of the string of fire finishes off and that's you can
[2:22:46.280 --> 2:22:50.760]  that's typical of a bump fire or slide fire mechanism so
[2:22:50.760 --> 2:22:54.040]  it's hard to tell for sure but there was a lot of fire there a lot of echo it
[2:22:54.040 --> 2:22:57.800]  did sound like there though that there were multiple strings of fire
[2:22:57.800 --> 2:23:01.160]  happening simultaneously
[2:23:01.880 --> 2:23:07.800]  now adding all this together we don't know exactly what's going on but we
[2:23:07.800 --> 2:23:10.520]  know they said this time of violence was coming they're
[2:23:10.520 --> 2:23:13.000]  going to overthrow trump they're going to get our guns
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:16.280]  the we know they sent democrats out to shoot scolese
[2:23:16.280 --> 2:23:20.040]  CNN celebrated it i have the video and then said he was not a bad guy he was
[2:23:20.040 --> 2:23:23.400]  upset politically so they're trying to encourage this they admit they are they
[2:23:23.400 --> 2:23:26.120]  have democrat operatives on tv saying hashtag
[2:23:26.120 --> 2:23:33.640]  hunt republicans as a top counterterrorism guy
[2:23:33.640 --> 2:23:37.320]  what do you think we should do what do you think we're up against here i mean
[2:23:37.320 --> 2:23:40.680]  clearly they're making their move i think all the evidence points
[2:23:40.680 --> 2:23:43.960]  towards this being a democrat deep state operation
[2:23:43.960 --> 2:23:47.880]  yeah well the first thing is we cannot allow them to divide us that's what they
[2:23:47.880 --> 2:23:52.200]  need in order to gain leverage and control over us as a nation they need to
[2:23:52.200 --> 2:23:55.640]  divide us and weaken us we need to be intelligent enough and
[2:23:55.640 --> 2:24:00.040]  strong enough not to allow that that's how we counter this attack against all
[2:24:00.040 --> 2:24:03.080]  of us whether we're democrat republican or any other
[2:24:03.080 --> 2:24:07.160]  the sub category that they wanted to divide us into we
[2:24:07.160 --> 2:24:11.480]  need to unite now more than ever and stand as one
[2:24:11.480 --> 2:24:16.360]  nation realize we are all under attack we are all being subverted
[2:24:16.360 --> 2:24:19.720]  and manipulated for leverage for those who
[2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:26.040]  want those global power mongers who want greater they want complete control
[2:24:26.040 --> 2:24:28.520]  over the united states and so we've got to recognize that
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:31.880]  so that's how we counter it we we stand as one
[2:24:31.880 --> 2:24:35.800]  we all research rather than just feeding off of headlines from the msm
[2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:38.920]  that we already know is hostile to we the american people
[2:24:38.920 --> 2:24:43.240]  due to who owns them and what their political outlook is
[2:24:43.240 --> 2:24:47.320]  we've got to unite we've got to educate each other and recognize what we're up
[2:24:47.320 --> 2:24:50.840]  against and stand against it that way they want to
[2:24:50.840 --> 2:24:54.440]  disarm us that's one thing that we must not allow them to do
[2:24:54.440 --> 2:24:58.360]  no matter how crazy the rhetoric gets well you hate children or something
[2:24:58.360 --> 2:25:00.360]  because you want to arm your family you know
[2:25:00.360 --> 2:25:03.720]  we've got to be wise enough to recognize the rhetoric
[2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:08.040]  and that it's hostile and just stand our ground look for real solutions if
[2:25:08.040 --> 2:25:11.720]  if uh hey if it's just a crazy person let's look at psychotropic let's look
[2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:15.080]  at medical care for for the mentally ill
[2:25:15.080 --> 2:25:19.480]  well let's let's seek real solutions as to why this happens
[2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:25.320]  if it's not just a deep state setup uh then if you look at the brother and him
[2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:29.560]  360 or 180 and you look at just all the craziness
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:32.840]  and our intel that's been proven accurate
[2:25:32.840 --> 2:25:36.440]  and schaefer and the top psychiatrist everybody saying
[2:25:36.440 --> 2:25:39.720]  this points towards deep state operatives a staged event
[2:25:39.720 --> 2:25:43.320]  because of how the democrats have been calling for violence the whole nfl thing
[2:25:43.320 --> 2:25:47.560]  they're trying to turn this country upside down and start a civil war
[2:25:47.560 --> 2:25:53.480]  yeah anytime you've got cameras that that public doesn't have access to uh
[2:25:53.480 --> 2:25:56.840]  they're they're trying to hide multiple players i mean you see that in a
[2:25:56.840 --> 2:25:59.960]  sure why would they release the footage of him i mean these are some of the
[2:25:59.960 --> 2:26:03.400]  most surveil craig you're a security expert your federal officer you do all
[2:26:03.400 --> 2:26:07.000]  this stuff 22 guns all these weapons cameras outside
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:09.960]  the hotel room well they don't tell the public this but hotels not just
[2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:13.000]  casinos have a procedure when you first leave your room when you check in they
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:17.560]  go search your stuff especially if you fit a you know a background
[2:26:17.560 --> 2:26:20.600]  a profile and then they go through everything else and then if you've been
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:24.360]  in your room for a day they come in whether it says do not disturb or not
[2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:28.200]  the fact that he's in there for five days with all these weapons and not
[2:26:28.200 --> 2:26:31.720]  not detected is impossible and then you've got the people in the crowd saying
[2:26:31.720 --> 2:26:34.920]  get out of here you're about to die that's confirmed what does that sound
[2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:39.160]  like craigsawyer yeah well that sounds suspicious to me
[2:26:39.160 --> 2:26:43.400]  look again a lot of the camera footage anytime something happens it's a false
[2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:46.760]  flag all of the camera surveillance footage gets
[2:26:46.760 --> 2:26:50.760]  rounded up by by the feds and nobody gets access to it ever
[2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:55.320]  and no matter how long it seems to go afterward so
[2:26:55.320 --> 2:26:59.160]  that that to me puts up a couple red flags this is making it highly
[2:26:59.160 --> 2:27:02.120]  suspicious so if it was just a single shooter they
[2:27:02.120 --> 2:27:05.240]  wouldn't have any problem with people reviewing that surveillance
[2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:11.000]  footage from from around the casino so um man it it feels bad feels bad
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:15.800]  Alex pardon me I'm the same way here with my
[2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:18.840]  cough it's all stuff in the air well Craig let's talk to you again very
[2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:22.280]  very soon as this unfolds Craig sore you got about a minute
[2:27:22.280 --> 2:27:27.160]  without final comments yeah well again I think it's just a
[2:27:27.160 --> 2:27:31.480]  matter of recognizing the hostility and what the objective is
[2:27:31.480 --> 2:27:35.720]  of our enemy there are our global enemies need us divided
[2:27:35.720 --> 2:27:39.720]  and disarmed that's what they're after and if you understand their objective
[2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:42.840]  you understand why they're doing what they're doing
[2:27:42.840 --> 2:27:46.520]  and through that we can best unite to counter it
[2:27:46.520 --> 2:27:50.680]  and not fall into the division let's not be rioting and kneeling and
[2:27:50.680 --> 2:27:55.400]  and shouting each other down and wearing masks and mass murdering each other we
[2:27:55.400 --> 2:27:58.600]  gotta we gotta be sharper than that or we're all in this together
[2:27:58.600 --> 2:28:01.560]  Americans we are all in it together we're about to lose
[2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:05.400]  the rest of our freedom by being foolish so I say that's the
[2:28:05.400 --> 2:28:09.400]  that's the key Alex recognize what's going on research
[2:28:09.400 --> 2:28:13.080]  network share with each other what's going on and look at it as honestly and
[2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:17.240]  accurately as possible and uh stand as one nation I guess that's right thank
[2:28:17.240 --> 2:28:19.800]  you Craig sorry we'll talk to you tacticalinsider.com

[2:28:26.120 --> 2:28:29.960]  connecting all the dots straight ahead I don't want to brag people you know we
[2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:32.200]  are at the cutting edge right now we are breaking
[2:28:32.200 --> 2:28:36.360]  this wide open uh the globalists aren't in total control anymore and we are
[2:28:36.360 --> 2:28:40.120]  destroying them right now stay with us
[2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:44.440]  it's not just our water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be
[2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:47.960]  cleaned it's the air we're breathing especially for our children the
[2:28:47.960 --> 2:28:52.040]  artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely

[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:22.360]  public doesn't the Alexa pure breeze would be a
[2:29:22.360 --> 2:29:25.640]  steal at three hundred four hundred five hundred dollars one of these systems
[2:29:25.640 --> 2:29:29.640]  can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean this is a system i'm personally
[2:29:29.640 --> 2:29:33.000]  putting in throughout my house replacing older more expensive filters
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:36.760]  that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so

[2:29:45.960 --> 2:29:50.280]  and information and in the last four or five years doing more and more research
[2:29:50.280 --> 2:29:53.400]  i came across the fact that the elite establishment
[2:29:53.400 --> 2:29:58.040]  is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much
[2:29:58.040 --> 2:30:02.520]  better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the
[2:30:02.520 --> 2:30:06.680]  bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing
[2:30:06.680 --> 2:30:10.360]  and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have

[2:33:07.880 --> 2:33:17.000]  it's alex jones all right lower laura loomer and millie weaver
[2:33:17.000 --> 2:33:20.840]  have been on parallel tracks researching this
[2:33:20.840 --> 2:33:24.360]  and i'll be honest at this point in my 22 years on air i am now
[2:33:24.360 --> 2:33:30.760]  officially beyond a headache i know this is real i know we're on to them
[2:33:30.760 --> 2:33:34.440]  we're actually fighting them in live time i'm getting direct intel from the
[2:33:34.440 --> 2:33:38.120]  fbi hostage rescue team we got the direct intel
[2:33:38.120 --> 2:33:42.360]  about hillary and her convulsions and her black
[2:33:42.360 --> 2:33:47.080]  ambulance and it's just like i can't believe maybe this is like a simulation
[2:33:47.080 --> 2:33:50.120]  and it's in like unplugged in somewhere like in total recall
[2:33:50.120 --> 2:33:54.200]  whether i'm the action invention star that starts the radio network tv thing
[2:33:54.200 --> 2:33:57.400]  that battles the globalist and then gets the president in and then
[2:33:57.400 --> 2:34:00.760]  we're battling them in real time they've staged a las vegas attack and
[2:34:00.760 --> 2:34:05.880]  i'm not saying i literally believe that but i i need a vacation
[2:34:05.880 --> 2:34:09.000]  because i watched all that footage of those poor people gulping for air
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:13.640]  bleeding and dying like fish out of water on top piles of
[2:34:13.640 --> 2:34:16.920]  beer cans man and i just really got to me
[2:34:16.920 --> 2:34:23.160]  and i've got three daughters and some of those girls are like 16 years old
[2:34:23.160 --> 2:34:26.760]  playing video of them gulping and dying and their souls leaving their bodies
[2:34:26.760 --> 2:34:31.640]  and their and them and them just just just fading away and then the whole mo
[2:34:31.640 --> 2:34:34.840]  it's him at the democrat thing on the video
[2:34:34.840 --> 2:34:37.560]  and the brother's got an earpiece it's so clear
[2:34:37.560 --> 2:34:42.680]  and the hotel who's who owns it and all of it and the democrats and they're
[2:34:42.680 --> 2:34:47.640]  just scum i mean the late night tv people
[2:34:47.640 --> 2:34:51.080]  in hollywood and all of it it is just like good lord
[2:34:51.080 --> 2:34:54.120]  and it's all run by a bunch of skexies like
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:34:58.440]  nancy polosi and that goblin creature michael moore and they're just all
[2:34:58.440 --> 2:35:02.040]  in a nazi collaborator who's done this in countless countries
[2:35:02.040 --> 2:35:05.480]  did the same stuff with mass shootings in ukraine to say the government did that
[2:35:05.480 --> 2:35:09.400]  and overthrow stuff uh i mean we're here millie weaver both you want to try to
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:13.000]  give you both the floor here because at this point my head is officially
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:16.120]  actually spending this is all you have it a few other times when i get so
[2:35:16.120 --> 2:35:19.000]  stressed out i start getting dizzy and then i have like a migraine headache
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:22.360]  so what's happening i've got a migraine headache coming on uh literally here on
[2:35:22.360 --> 2:35:25.800]  air so millie introduce the research you've done
[2:35:25.800 --> 2:35:29.560]  and then you can co-host here with uh with laura loomer
[2:35:29.560 --> 2:35:33.320]  to go over this and i'm gonna i'm gonna let you you ladies host this segment
[2:35:33.320 --> 2:35:35.720]  there's seven minutes left and 10 minutes to the next and i'll be back in
[2:35:35.720 --> 2:35:39.320]  about 15 minutes to ten full or stay with us
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:43.080]  all right so some of the things that we first saw with this
[2:35:43.080 --> 2:35:46.680]  shooting in las vegas is that it was highly unconventional
[2:35:46.680 --> 2:35:50.280]  it was out of the ordinary everybody was looking at this going all right this
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:53.480]  isn't making sense it's reeks of a cover story
[2:35:53.480 --> 2:35:56.760]  they're not giving us all of the information and i know laura loomer has
[2:35:56.760 --> 2:36:01.000]  put together some amazing information she has some awesome sources and
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:04.440]  me and her spent like an hour in the phone last night just kind of hashing
[2:36:04.440 --> 2:36:07.320]  it out trying to figure out what in the world is going on
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:10.920]  because i have sources as well that are working with um
[2:36:10.920 --> 2:36:15.640]  as contractors for you know high-level groups and they were saying that this
[2:36:15.640 --> 2:36:19.640]  guy steven paddock he comes across as the guy who
[2:36:19.640 --> 2:36:24.520]  has the mo of a contractor a weapons dealer of some sort
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:28.360]  so he doesn't seem to be just a regular lone wolf
[2:36:28.360 --> 2:36:32.200]  guy here and we now have confirmed that he wasn't a lone wolf
[2:36:32.200 --> 2:36:36.440]  with the receipts so i wanted to get your take laura what are you thinking on
[2:36:36.440 --> 2:36:40.760]  this give us some input well yeah as uh as you mentioned
[2:36:40.760 --> 2:36:44.120]  you and i were discussing this last night and you know there's a lot of things
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:47.960]  that suggest that um either it's some type of a deep
[2:36:47.960 --> 2:36:52.120]  state cover-up or you know that uh steven paddock had
[2:36:52.120 --> 2:36:57.080]  ties to islamic terrorists whether it was a gun running operation gone wrong
[2:36:57.080 --> 2:37:00.680]  or in fact he was um an isis operative himself
[2:37:00.680 --> 2:37:05.240]  so uh already if you look at the one hundred thousand dollar transaction to
[2:37:05.240 --> 2:37:09.080]  the philippines and the fact that alex has already mentioned that a lot of
[2:37:09.080 --> 2:37:13.080]  those weapons were not uh purchased uh it makes you wonder
[2:37:13.080 --> 2:37:16.600]  how did he obtain those weapons and the explosives that were found in his other
[2:37:16.600 --> 2:37:19.480]  properties because a hundred thousand dollars that can get you
[2:37:19.480 --> 2:37:23.480]  you know some pretty top grade weapons assault rifles a lot of ammunition a lot
[2:37:23.480 --> 2:37:26.200]  of explosives and we're not even being told yet
[2:37:26.200 --> 2:37:30.760]  uh you know what they found on his laptop um the other type of ammunition
[2:37:30.760 --> 2:37:33.560]  and weapons they found on his other properties so
[2:37:33.560 --> 2:37:37.480]  um that's gun running money i mean of course usually arms dealers are
[2:37:37.480 --> 2:37:41.320]  involved in multi-million dollar deals but one hundred thousand dollars is
[2:37:41.320 --> 2:37:45.240]  enough to buy you the type of weapons exactly and we know that he was a high
[2:37:45.240 --> 2:37:49.160]  limit gambler and he has a record of high limit gambling and typically
[2:37:49.160 --> 2:37:53.240]  that's how you wash money so if you're gonna go ahead and
[2:37:53.240 --> 2:37:57.000]  wash through this this gun money or weapons money
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:01.560]  um who better than a former accountant and auditor that worked
[2:38:01.560 --> 2:38:04.920]  for the predecessor of lockheed martin to do it
[2:38:04.920 --> 2:38:09.480]  i mean something's really unusual here we also know that steven paddock had a
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:12.600]  pilot's license he owned two single engine
[2:38:12.600 --> 2:38:16.520]  airplanes so was he potentially flying weapons
[2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:20.600]  what was this guy's history we need to know more about that but i also do agree
[2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:24.200]  with laura in the sense that isis has claimed responsibility
[2:38:24.200 --> 2:38:27.640]  they have not been known to claim falsely
[2:38:27.640 --> 2:38:32.440]  for an attack that has happened and so why would they claim falsely here and
[2:38:32.440 --> 2:38:36.840]  is it likely that there was a a weapons deal that
[2:38:36.840 --> 2:38:39.640]  happened between an isis group and this person
[2:38:39.640 --> 2:38:45.800]  that went awry right yeah and of course there's a lot of islamic connections to
[2:38:45.800 --> 2:38:49.880]  you know the the muslim world and los vegas a lot of people don't know this
[2:38:49.880 --> 2:38:54.520]  but mgm resorts which is where this attack took place
[2:38:54.520 --> 2:38:59.160]  jubai world which is owned by the jubai government used to own half of mgm
[2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:02.280]  and just recently they signed their own deal to
[2:39:02.280 --> 2:39:07.240]  establish their own mgm resorts in jubai right so in the middle east so
[2:39:07.240 --> 2:39:11.960]  there is a heavy islamic connection the girlfriend is involved in the casino
[2:39:11.960 --> 2:39:15.720]  industry as well she worked for atlantis which is
[2:39:15.720 --> 2:39:20.200]  owned by an iranian of course and so there's multiple
[2:39:20.200 --> 2:39:23.720]  connections to people in the middle east and countries that
[2:39:23.720 --> 2:39:27.880]  have been known to have you know extreme ties to terrorism
[2:39:27.880 --> 2:39:31.560]  and if you look at iran for example in the connection with the girlfriend who's
[2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:35.960]  now you know a prime suspect in this case it really it really makes you wonder
[2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:40.040]  and you know it would just make so much sense this is what's coming together
[2:39:40.040 --> 2:39:44.120]  in my mind if this room was wired up with cameras why would the shooter why
[2:39:44.120 --> 2:39:48.280]  would steven paddock go ahead and wire up the room with cameras if he's just
[2:39:48.280 --> 2:39:51.240]  going to go do a shooting and then commit suicide
[2:39:51.240 --> 2:39:55.720]  but it makes sense that it could have been an fbi sting where you have a weapons
[2:39:55.720 --> 2:39:59.080]  transfer go down now we also have found that
[2:39:59.080 --> 2:40:03.720]  yes this was a large suite and there is some confusion over the windows
[2:40:03.720 --> 2:40:07.080]  that were that were shot and that had holes in them
[2:40:07.080 --> 2:40:11.160]  but let's show this image here that i found that it actually shows that
[2:40:11.160 --> 2:40:15.160]  there were two rooms that had the windows
[2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:18.600]  alone in them you actually had a hotel suite window
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:22.680]  over on one side and then you also had another hotel room that had a connecting
[2:40:22.680 --> 2:40:25.240]  door and this is pretty amazing to see this image here because
[2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:28.280]  laura loomer actually was one who told me yesterday that
[2:40:28.280 --> 2:40:31.640]  it might have actually been two rooms with a connecting
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:35.240]  door there so i found that interesting to see that come to fruition
[2:40:35.240 --> 2:40:39.160]  and then we also see that there was record of this receipt saying that there
[2:40:39.160 --> 2:40:42.600]  were two people that were ordering this meal from that room
[2:40:42.600 --> 2:40:46.920]  so was there another person here why would why would he have accessed
[2:40:46.920 --> 2:40:51.720]  two different hotel rooms and shot from two different hotel room windows
[2:40:51.720 --> 2:40:56.040]  right yeah so as i was posting a lot of this information and sources who work
[2:40:56.040 --> 2:40:59.160]  at the mandalay told me that he had the suite
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:03.480]  the suite which he was originally saying and booked for the 25th
[2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:07.160]  and then two days later he added on the connecting room which was booked
[2:41:07.160 --> 2:41:10.840]  in his girlfriend's name so the suite that he was saying it was booked in his
[2:41:10.840 --> 2:41:14.040]  name and then the second room which is the connector which is why there's
[2:41:14.040 --> 2:41:17.160]  another window that's blown out that was under his girlfriend's name so there
[2:41:17.160 --> 2:41:22.520]  are two rooms and then the employee at mandalay my source told me
[2:41:22.520 --> 2:41:26.600]  that the room service charges were redirected to the other room
[2:41:26.600 --> 2:41:30.040]  so while he was staying in one room he had them
[2:41:30.040 --> 2:41:34.040]  you know like swap out the direction of where his meals and
[2:41:34.040 --> 2:41:40.440]  you know charges were being delivered and marked so i found
[2:41:40.440 --> 2:41:43.400]  that to be really interesting and really suspicious because if you are
[2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:47.560]  planning to conduct some type of massacre or you're setting up a war zone in
[2:41:47.560 --> 2:41:50.760]  your suite of course you're not going to want people to come to your room so
[2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:54.680]  you're going to redirect them to the room next door that may be the reason why
[2:41:54.680 --> 2:41:58.760]  he purchased the connecting room because why would you need a connecting room
[2:41:58.760 --> 2:42:02.360]  if you're staying in a room by yourself you wouldn't right but then the receipts
[2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:05.080]  that i released to paul joseph watson today that are
[2:42:05.080 --> 2:42:08.040]  now on info wars and at the top of drudge report
[2:42:08.040 --> 2:42:11.640]  right uh they show that there were two guests
[2:42:11.640 --> 2:42:15.640]  two guests in the room exactly could this be what we're seeing is that
[2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:21.560]  the fbi is trying to cover up a weapons deal gone bad and that's why we're
[2:42:21.560 --> 2:42:26.040]  seeing so many holes in this story here well we'll find out after this break
[2:42:26.040 --> 2:42:28.840]  guys stay tuned because we will be right back with laura

[2:47:04.760 --> 2:47:09.880]  loomer who has done an amazing amount of research and investigation into this
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:15.000]  las vegas shooting could it be that steven paddock was a lone gunman that
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:19.000]  was crazed potentially on sri's and just decided to
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:23.640]  shoot up a group of people or could there be something more sinister at play
[2:47:23.640 --> 2:47:26.840]  could it be that potentially steven paddock was
[2:47:26.840 --> 2:47:31.880]  involved in a guns or weapons transfer to a terrorist group such as ices
[2:47:31.880 --> 2:47:35.400]  well that's what we're trying to get to the bottom up or could it be that
[2:47:35.400 --> 2:47:39.560]  steven paddock himself joined the radical group ices and carried out the
[2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:42.840]  attack potentially with another person involved
[2:47:42.840 --> 2:47:47.160]  well we're here with laura loomer and laura i really wanted to ask you about
[2:47:47.160 --> 2:47:52.600]  your intel on this muslim woman who apparently was the woman that was at
[2:47:52.600 --> 2:47:55.240]  the concert telling people they were going to die so what do you know about
[2:47:55.240 --> 2:47:59.080]  that okay so um as i don't know a lot of people
[2:47:59.080 --> 2:48:01.800]  have seen this video because the mainstream media has been hiding it but
[2:48:01.800 --> 2:48:05.240]  there's a video of a woman who was celebrating her 21st birthday the
[2:48:05.240 --> 2:48:08.760]  night of the shooting and she was interviewed by the local news and they
[2:48:08.760 --> 2:48:13.240]  asked her if she noticed anything weird and she said that there was a woman who
[2:48:13.240 --> 2:48:17.480]  appeared to look hispanic who came up and started harassing people in the
[2:48:17.480 --> 2:48:20.920]  audience and saying you're all going to die tonight you're all going to be dead
[2:48:20.920 --> 2:48:24.600]  and then she was freaking people out and security took her away and then we
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:28.440]  didn't really hear about what happened to her i received intel this morning from
[2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:34.280]  a source uh that is claiming that uh this uh this woman has
[2:48:34.280 --> 2:48:37.880]  been detained and is in custody by police right now in
[2:48:37.880 --> 2:48:44.200]  las vegas and that she is muslim why are the feds being quiet about this
[2:48:44.200 --> 2:48:47.880]  well that's really interesting if she is in fact muslim that really does
[2:48:47.880 --> 2:48:51.480]  implicate implicate isis and we know that isis has already
[2:48:51.480 --> 2:48:54.600]  tried to come out and claim responsibility for this so how would
[2:48:54.600 --> 2:48:58.200]  she have known in advance that this attack was going to happen
[2:48:58.200 --> 2:49:02.440]  so you have to wonder that of course and uh you know info wars just released
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:05.800]  this great uh side-by-side video i believe yesterday or
[2:49:05.800 --> 2:49:08.680]  early this morning that shows similarities between
[2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:13.320]  the same incident that took place at the ariana grande concert in manchester
[2:49:13.320 --> 2:49:16.920]  where a woman said that she noticed the stranger muslim woman
[2:49:16.920 --> 2:49:20.120]  who you know kept fidgeting with a bag and looking towards the back where the
[2:49:20.120 --> 2:49:22.840]  explosion was going to happen and she wasn't really paying attention to the
[2:49:22.840 --> 2:49:25.960]  concert and she got up and left two minutes before
[2:49:25.960 --> 2:49:29.880]  the bomb went off right and then we have a similar situation where a
[2:49:29.880 --> 2:49:33.480]  suspicious woman who looks hispanic but as i was
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:37.320]  discussing with you last night like hispanic people and muslim people can
[2:49:37.320 --> 2:49:42.200]  often look the same i mean with the you know darker skin tone it's hard to
[2:49:42.200 --> 2:49:46.600]  um yeah that would be easy to mistake definitely you could mix that up easily
[2:49:46.600 --> 2:49:49.800]  but i wanted to talk a little bit about some of the discrepancies
[2:49:49.800 --> 2:49:53.320]  that we've we found out here now they're reporting that
[2:49:53.320 --> 2:49:57.640]  steven paddock was wearing gloves when he was laying their dead on the floor
[2:49:57.640 --> 2:50:02.040]  and that kind of really sparked in my mind why would you be wearing gloves
[2:50:02.040 --> 2:50:07.000]  essentially maybe trying to hide your fingerprints on the guns on the weapons
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:10.520]  if you were just planning to do a suicide
[2:50:10.520 --> 2:50:14.280]  event where you essentially kill people and then you know shoot yourself in the
[2:50:14.280 --> 2:50:17.960]  head why would you wear gloves that that's what i'm wondering
[2:50:17.960 --> 2:50:20.840]  i was wondering the same thing and of course you know you and i were talking
[2:50:20.840 --> 2:50:23.960]  about this last night and i thought it was rather suspicious but then i started
[2:50:23.960 --> 2:50:28.440]  talking to my law enforcement sources and people in um you know the gun
[2:50:28.440 --> 2:50:32.680]  industry and they started telling me that a lot of these weapons that
[2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:35.960]  were used to commit this attack they get very hot
[2:50:35.960 --> 2:50:41.320]  you know these automatic weapons and so it is possible that he was using gloves
[2:50:41.320 --> 2:50:46.120]  to protect his hands from the heat because this shooting went on for a while
[2:50:46.120 --> 2:50:50.360]  before police or SWAT were able to even get to him
[2:50:50.360 --> 2:50:55.400]  and so that may be a reason why but i do find it to be rather suspicious that
[2:50:55.400 --> 2:50:58.840]  supposedly he shot himself in the head with a revolver
[2:50:58.840 --> 2:51:02.040]  and that he was wearing gloves to do it i mean it's kind of hard
[2:51:02.040 --> 2:51:06.120]  i've shot a revolver before and it's kind of hard to shoot a revolver
[2:51:06.120 --> 2:51:09.400]  because it's uh you know like a small trigger and just imagine having
[2:51:09.400 --> 2:51:13.240]  bulky gloves while you're trying to shoot a revolver and of course revolvers
[2:51:13.240 --> 2:51:16.440]  um from what i'm being told don't eject shell casings so
[2:51:16.440 --> 2:51:19.960]  no they're revolvers you have to do it by hand Laura Loomer i'm back again Alex
[2:51:19.960 --> 2:51:23.000]  Jones here literally not not putting that on earlier that every once in a while
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:26.120]  i get so much news info i start getting a migraine headache with these bright
[2:51:26.120 --> 2:51:29.000]  lights if i can just get out of here for five minutes i went took some aspirin
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:32.520]  so uh i am back ladies and gentlemen but listening to you guys while i was in my
[2:51:32.520 --> 2:51:36.120]  office Laura Loomer and Millie we were uh breaking all this down i'm gonna
[2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:39.160]  host some of the next hour with roger stone but
[2:51:39.160 --> 2:51:43.160]  ladies and gentlemen i've covered 9-11 i've covered
[2:51:43.160 --> 2:51:47.160]  oklahoma city i have covered a lot of stuff and
[2:51:47.160 --> 2:51:52.760]  you know i watched those videos because i started seeing people saying the
[2:51:52.760 --> 2:51:56.760]  shooting was fake and all that and oh they're saying i bet Alex Jones says
[2:51:56.760 --> 2:52:00.680]  it's fake no we said about sandy hook we had debates playing
[2:52:00.680 --> 2:52:04.600]  devil's advocate walking through like police investigators do
[2:52:04.600 --> 2:52:07.320]  okay what have happened this way or what have happened that way and i've been
[2:52:07.320 --> 2:52:10.760]  saying for three plus four years i believe kids died there okay but i know
[2:52:10.760 --> 2:52:13.880]  they stage the babies and the incubators and other events the media then
[2:52:13.880 --> 2:52:17.800]  lies and says that i say you know nobody died there
[2:52:17.800 --> 2:52:21.560]  once you know the parents once you know the babies that died once you have the
[2:52:21.560 --> 2:52:23.960]  proof they died in the incubators then i would say
[2:52:23.960 --> 2:52:28.440]  iraq was real but it turned out to be fake it once you learn it's real
[2:52:28.440 --> 2:52:32.360]  you have to admit it's real and it's the same thing we knew this was real a
[2:52:32.360 --> 2:52:36.840]  giant concert 23 000 people all that happening the eyewitnesses
[2:52:36.840 --> 2:52:40.280]  there they wouldn't do something like that there they do it in a contained
[2:52:40.280 --> 2:52:44.360]  school if they were going to stage a hoax but that's not what i'm saying about
[2:52:44.360 --> 2:52:48.120]  sandy hook we know mass shootings happen we also know they use them in the
[2:52:48.120 --> 2:52:51.880]  wiki leaks it admits this to take our guns and restrict our lives they bring
[2:52:51.880 --> 2:52:55.800]  in radical muslims so they attack us and they can take our freedoms so this is
[2:52:55.800 --> 2:52:59.320]  this transference into this authoritarian civilization
[2:52:59.320 --> 2:53:03.000]  and you've got some people out there saying hey alex you know it's crisis
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:07.080]  actors hey i've watched people die in car wrecks
[2:53:07.080 --> 2:53:10.040]  pulled over and given aid when somebody's heads have chopped off i've seen
[2:53:10.040 --> 2:53:12.840]  what it looks like i've been there when family died
[2:53:12.840 --> 2:53:15.880]  i've been there when friends died i know what real looks like
[2:53:15.880 --> 2:53:19.800]  i can tell hillary would do those town halls and i'd say that was a fake town
[2:53:19.800 --> 2:53:23.880]  hall shot in like 35 millimeter maybe 80 millimeter it was so
[2:53:23.880 --> 2:53:28.520]  it was like scorsese or or you know uh steven spilbergen made it i mean
[2:53:28.520 --> 2:53:34.600]  you know a movie the production okay i have seen their fake garbage over and
[2:53:34.600 --> 2:53:38.760]  over again i watched last night in this morning
[2:53:38.760 --> 2:53:43.560]  probably an hour of it okay of women with their lives going on that looked
[2:53:43.560 --> 2:53:48.120]  like my daughters with air gulping out and their eyes fading out
[2:53:48.120 --> 2:53:51.960]  you can't fake that not a thousand academy awards can fake that
[2:53:51.960 --> 2:53:56.120]  it was real they wouldn't do it a big open thing like that with crisis actors
[2:53:56.120 --> 2:53:59.800]  and all the rest of the garbage and the media always describes to me the crisis
[2:53:59.800 --> 2:54:02.920]  actor stuff and then says in every case i'm saying it's actors when the
[2:54:02.920 --> 2:54:07.240]  democrats say we're hiring actors to be antifa to help stir stuff up and it's
[2:54:07.240 --> 2:54:10.600]  officially on their site and the same company was hired for hillary's
[2:54:10.600 --> 2:54:15.000]  fake ads i say it when they say they did it
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:18.760]  this is real and it makes you want to punch anybody in the nose it says it
[2:54:18.760 --> 2:54:22.280]  didn't you've got your first amendment rights but this attack was real and i'm
[2:54:22.280 --> 2:54:24.520]  not going to have the media say i didn't say it was real
[2:54:24.520 --> 2:54:28.680]  i watched those videos that's real and i know people that were responding there
[2:54:28.680 --> 2:54:32.280]  they saw it it's real sorry go ahead yeah it's definitely real and even the
[2:54:32.280 --> 2:54:35.800]  delayed response people not even recognizing that those were bullets at
[2:54:35.800 --> 2:54:39.400]  first if they were actors don't you think they would immediately on q start
[2:54:39.400 --> 2:54:43.000]  running around no it was real the people well the one thing they also use on some
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:45.080]  of the tapes is where's the bullet hole i can't find it
[2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:49.720]  i've shot deer okay between the eyes and as the bullet doesn't come out you
[2:54:49.720 --> 2:54:53.160]  can't even find the hole except maybe one drop of blood that came out another
[2:54:53.160 --> 2:54:55.320]  time it blows the whole side of their head off
[2:54:55.320 --> 2:54:59.080]  okay i've shot elk i've shot every the buffalo you name it with bows
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:03.800]  i've shot wall hogs codes i mean a lot of times you can't find the bullet hole
[2:55:03.800 --> 2:55:06.920]  until you just see the big pool of blood because their heart quit pumping and
[2:55:06.920 --> 2:55:10.600]  the blood stopped going out okay but i'm sorry go ahead
[2:55:10.600 --> 2:55:14.600]  you know it's interesting also the fact that the democrats already had
[2:55:14.600 --> 2:55:19.000]  gun legislation in the works to try and go after our gun rights
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:23.800]  and then this happens and it just it re they've been saying a revolution's
[2:55:23.800 --> 2:55:27.400]  coming in october this is it laura lumar what's your gut
[2:55:27.400 --> 2:55:30.440]  tell you what are your latest sources coming in telling you
[2:55:30.440 --> 2:55:33.800]  well another piece of information that i released yesterday that ties hillary
[2:55:33.800 --> 2:55:39.800]  clinton to the resort where this attack took place is the ceo from what i'm
[2:55:39.800 --> 2:55:44.040]  being told by employees um was providing through the union
[2:55:44.040 --> 2:55:48.040]  10 weeks of paid leave for employees who wanted to campaign for hillary
[2:55:48.040 --> 2:55:52.280]  clinton during the election so yeah they're hardcore embedded
[2:55:52.280 --> 2:55:57.240]  with the whole sorrows combine so that's very suspicious i don't know why
[2:55:57.240 --> 2:56:01.080]  you know the union for mgm would be giving 10 weeks of paid leave for
[2:56:01.080 --> 2:56:03.800]  employees laura do we know any more through your great
[2:56:03.800 --> 2:56:06.360]  investigative journalism with the sources about the
[2:56:06.360 --> 2:56:09.000]  suspant couple warning people get out of here
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:13.640]  you're going to be dead i uh supposed i've been told that there were two people
[2:56:13.640 --> 2:56:17.080]  but i didn't want to officially report that there were two people because i've
[2:56:17.080 --> 2:56:22.440]  only really uh like received strong intel that uh one female is in custody
[2:56:22.440 --> 2:56:25.960]  so there is the possibility that there is another individual
[2:56:25.960 --> 2:56:29.000]  that's huge you're saying people because you've always been great reporting
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:31.720]  i mean you've got great laura lima is a great investigative journalist you're
[2:56:31.720 --> 2:56:35.480]  saying you've got sources that they have people in custody we don't know about
[2:56:35.480 --> 2:56:38.920]  yeah i'm being told that there are actually two muslims in custody but
[2:56:38.920 --> 2:56:43.480]  i didn't want to report the second person because like i said i i didn't want to
[2:56:43.480 --> 2:56:48.040]  you know go with something that hasn't been confirmed well i heard this two
[2:56:48.040 --> 2:56:51.160]  days ago that there's massive amounts of muslims coming in
[2:56:51.160 --> 2:56:55.720]  uh this week and then here it is middle east air force books entire hotel tower

[2:57:48.520 --> 2:57:53.480]  today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they
[2:57:53.480 --> 2:57:58.280]  were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but

[3:00:03.080 --> 3:00:05.800]  this terrible crime that's been committed and these poor victims and
[3:00:05.800 --> 3:00:09.480]  our families we should pray for and support america isn't buying the
[3:00:09.480 --> 3:00:12.600]  official story because they're not giving us one because they're covering up
[3:00:12.600 --> 3:00:15.880]  what happened yeah and we know that and everything i've
[3:00:15.880 --> 3:00:19.720]  been breaking here comes right from good sources and is now being confirmed
[3:00:19.720 --> 3:00:23.320]  but i have a sick feeling it being confirmed i don't like to be proven
[3:00:23.320 --> 3:00:26.600]  right uh about things this evil i wish i was wrong
[3:00:26.600 --> 3:00:29.640]  but i'm not the one that's right or wrong these are good sources and we're a
[3:00:29.640 --> 3:00:33.720]  major news platform top links on drudge that the
[3:00:33.720 --> 3:00:36.360]  sheriff saying they're investigating if he was radicalized that means they saw
[3:00:36.360 --> 3:00:38.600]  signs of it he said unfortunately we're having to go on that
[3:00:38.600 --> 3:00:41.400]  line because can't believe it we gotta do it he's
[3:00:41.400 --> 3:00:45.000]  just like he's about to cry what they've discovered and then you've got him on
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:47.880]  drugs just like we first broke it daniel said monday

[3:00:57.480 --> 3:01:01.640]  but just finishing up this is a time to really be focused and frosty
[3:01:01.640 --> 3:01:05.400]  like i said on sunday show and friday show to be armed to be vigilant
[3:01:05.400 --> 3:01:09.320]  and to be involved in the info war as well and to be peaceful never offensive
[3:01:09.320 --> 3:01:12.600]  but the season of the false flags and them blaming us are
[3:01:12.600 --> 3:01:16.200]  here but it shows you that they can't carry these out very well
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:19.640]  and their whole story the wheels have come off and folks know
[3:01:19.640 --> 3:01:22.840]  i don't just say the wheels have come off unless they have so final comments

[3:02:02.680 --> 3:02:05.800]  thank you laura thank you and millie thank you and it's not about thank you
[3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:09.240]  thank you thank you but when something's this big and it's dangerous
[3:02:09.240 --> 3:02:12.840]  uh and it takes a lot of research and a lot of digging
[3:02:12.840 --> 3:02:16.920]  and well this isn't a movie this is real real life it's stressful
[3:02:16.920 --> 3:02:19.560]  we're all i'm gonna say it i'm not saying we're as good as the veterans because i
[3:02:19.560 --> 3:02:22.600]  love them they're great but we're serving in the battle for the republic
[3:02:22.600 --> 3:02:27.000]  this is the big war where we are in the war it's an information war it's a
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:30.680]  silent weapons for silent war this is how they're going to come after our
[3:02:30.680 --> 3:02:34.520]  rights our freedoms our gun rights and that's really what this is
[3:02:34.520 --> 3:02:37.880]  all about at the end of the day the democrats did push the legislation
[3:02:37.880 --> 3:02:42.680]  through for this gun control legislation and this was the perfect
[3:02:42.680 --> 3:02:47.240]  catalyst the perfect situation to create prior to that to use it as an example
[3:02:47.240 --> 3:02:50.760]  as to why we need to limit our firearms and
[3:02:50.760 --> 3:02:55.400]  i'm sorry but this just wreaks so much of some kind of a deep state operation
[3:02:55.400 --> 3:02:59.800]  and yes it may be antifuzzavolt maybe isis i do think it's more likely that isis
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:04.040]  is involved but these are tentacles of the same and she's going back to the
[3:03:04.040 --> 3:03:08.360]  to the philippines yeah and you've had the major isis uprisings at the end of the
[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:12.600]  day it's the deep state that's the big octopus who we've already seen
[3:03:12.600 --> 3:03:17.000]  colluding with the democratic party leaders over spying on trump's campaign
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:20.680]  well let's get you back on the war room coming up today with elin shroyer and
[3:03:20.680 --> 3:03:22.920]  of course roger stone will be popping back in on that
[3:03:22.920 --> 3:03:25.800]  so great job with your investigative journalism millie weaver
[3:03:25.800 --> 3:03:29.960]  thank you very much alex thank you all right go ahead well i just wanted to
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:34.920]  talk a little bit more on um on steven and just say one last thing on him
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:38.840]  he reeks of some kind of a weapons contractor and i'm going to continue
[3:03:38.840 --> 3:03:41.560]  getting to the bottom of that and i will be updating oh he's got millions of
[3:03:41.560 --> 3:03:44.440]  dollars he gets to gamble professionally but never runs out of money
[3:03:44.440 --> 3:03:48.680]  yeah yeah where's he getting his money from oh is he washing it in casinos
[3:03:48.680 --> 3:03:51.400]  because that's typically what you do with black market money you wash it
[3:03:51.400 --> 3:03:54.680]  through casinos and that would mean that's why he's a high limit
[3:03:54.680 --> 3:03:58.840]  gambling stay right there roger stone give us your 60 second or 50 second
[3:03:58.840 --> 3:04:01.240]  approximation of what you see happening here
[3:04:01.240 --> 3:04:05.400]  okay what i see alex i see citizen journalism taking control in this
[3:04:05.400 --> 3:04:10.120]  country like never before people have figured out the nbcs the cbs is the
[3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:14.280]  cnns that they're full of it and they have to go to sites like info wars to
[3:04:14.280 --> 3:04:17.640]  get the cutting-edge truth in this entire matter
[3:04:17.640 --> 3:04:21.080]  i'll tell you it's sad but but true because i don't want to get ratings this
[3:04:21.080 --> 3:04:25.640]  way but we have gargantuan traffic to everything millions and millions of
[3:04:25.640 --> 3:04:30.040]  new listeners every few hours at info wars dot com and news wars dot com
[3:04:30.040 --> 3:04:33.000]  stay with us roger stone straight ahead for the next hour
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:38.840]  then the war room with our destroyer roger stone and more stay with us
[3:04:39.880 --> 3:04:43.720]  a staunch anti-fetalist patrick kenry was opposed to the constitution fearing
[3:04:43.720 --> 3:04:47.080]  it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states
[3:04:47.080 --> 3:04:50.600]  that had created it but that it would become a tool to destroy individual
[3:04:50.600 --> 3:04:53.960]  liberty his warnings ignored have now come to pass
[3:04:53.960 --> 3:04:57.080]  he said you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased
[3:04:57.080 --> 3:05:01.560]  nor how you were to become a great and powerful people but how your liberties
[3:05:01.560 --> 3:05:05.480]  can be secured for liberty ought to be the direct end of your government
[3:05:05.480 --> 3:05:09.480]  patrick kenry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be
[3:05:09.480 --> 3:05:13.640]  secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them
[3:05:13.640 --> 3:05:17.960]  today everything the government does at every level is concealed from us
[3:05:17.960 --> 3:05:21.160]  we have trade deals to manage our economy but not even our elected
[3:05:21.160 --> 3:05:24.840]  representatives are allowed to see later in life patrick kenry looked back and
[3:05:24.840 --> 3:05:27.160]  said when the american spirit was in its youth
[3:05:27.160 --> 3:05:31.320]  the language of america was different liberty sir was the primary object
[3:05:31.320 --> 3:05:36.600]  today our primary concern is safety and comfort when we should be demanding
[3:05:36.600 --> 3:05:55.480]  liberty for info wars dot com i'm david night
[3:05:55.480 --> 3:06:02.120]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines
[3:06:02.120 --> 3:06:12.120]  of the info war
[3:06:17.320 --> 3:06:21.160]  alex jones here with roger stone i'm gonna eject out here in about 12 minutes
[3:06:21.160 --> 3:06:25.160]  or 10 minutes but i wanted to finish up the roger was this a weapons transfer
[3:06:25.160 --> 3:06:28.360]  gone bad i know from our hostage rescue team sources on
[3:06:28.360 --> 3:06:33.320]  monday morning just 12 hours after this had taken place they said no he fired
[3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:36.840]  back we killed him you know we put the photo out that they tried to deny it
[3:06:36.840 --> 3:06:40.680]  first now they admit it's a real photo and then of course expanding on all of
[3:06:40.680 --> 3:06:44.920]  that on my twitter real alex jones expanding on all that our sources
[3:06:44.920 --> 3:06:49.960]  said that uh there was definitely the bs going on was the words used and that
[3:06:49.960 --> 3:06:54.280]  there was a lot of middle eastern travel documents and information photos
[3:06:54.280 --> 3:06:58.200]  and that he had women going back and forth not just the girlfriend but
[3:06:58.200 --> 3:07:01.960]  the women and others and now we know she had like two husbands
[3:07:01.960 --> 3:07:05.000]  going to the middle east going to the philippines with the big al-qaeda
[3:07:05.000 --> 3:07:08.600]  isis uprisings uh he had millions and millions of dollars just
[3:07:08.600 --> 3:07:12.040]  gambled all the time was traveling back and forth in and out of the country
[3:07:12.040 --> 3:07:14.920]  obviously using the casinos to launder the money that's what they use those
[3:07:14.920 --> 3:07:18.200]  for and then the brother gives these testimonies where oh he wasn't involved
[3:07:18.200 --> 3:07:22.040]  anything didn't own any guns oh he had guns he's the master money did it all
[3:07:22.040 --> 3:07:27.800]  in in 48 hour total 180 uh he's like an earpiece in he's like well what'd i say
[3:07:27.800 --> 3:07:30.760]  sorry i didn't get that right okay i'll get it right this time i mean
[3:07:30.760 --> 3:07:34.120]  this is like loyal and hardy are running this or something
[3:07:34.120 --> 3:07:37.640]  uh so i've never seen anything like this all i know is
[3:07:37.640 --> 3:07:41.240]  they're trying to blame gun owners when it was patriots that got targeted
[3:07:41.240 --> 3:07:44.520]  they're making their move the democrats have said they're going to have
[3:07:44.520 --> 3:07:48.600]  a huge uprising in october november it's here roger
[3:07:48.600 --> 3:07:53.160]  we we've laid all this out we've told folks it's here and now i have
[3:07:53.160 --> 3:07:58.280]  colonel schaefer of the cia high level and we've got top psychiatrists from you
[3:07:58.280 --> 3:08:00.920]  know from the federal government that have examined these people and they're
[3:08:00.920 --> 3:08:04.360]  saying clearly he's antifa clearly it's the mo to trigger a helter
[3:08:04.360 --> 3:08:06.840]  skelter revolution clearly the democrats are saying
[3:08:06.840 --> 3:08:11.400]  hashtag hunt republicans they've created the climate uh i mean this is an
[3:08:11.400 --> 3:08:16.040]  incredible time to be alive where they target patriots and then blame us for
[3:08:16.040 --> 3:08:20.760]  it roger what's your gut tell you because this is just so bombshell
[3:08:20.760 --> 3:08:25.160]  well yesterday alex as you know on the war room uh we aired um
[3:08:25.160 --> 3:08:29.800]  a video that we found uh at youtube that clearly shows
[3:08:29.800 --> 3:08:33.640]  paddock the shooter attending an anti trump
[3:08:33.640 --> 3:08:36.840]  rally a woman refers to him by his first name
[3:08:36.840 --> 3:08:41.320]  steven he he answers to it making it even more obvious that
[3:08:41.320 --> 3:08:44.520]  he has a leftist connection and if it's not him
[3:08:44.520 --> 3:08:47.720]  it's his twin brother i mean the video is conclusive
[3:08:47.720 --> 3:08:52.600]  it is him or it's his twin brother there's no there's no question about it
[3:08:52.600 --> 3:08:57.800]  and uh you know you and i both remember back in 1963
[3:08:57.800 --> 3:09:01.240]  when the mainstream media came out almost immediately and said
[3:09:01.240 --> 3:09:07.480]  lee harvey oswald loan nut communist came from russia and so on that became
[3:09:07.480 --> 3:09:13.880]  the official narrative that won't work anymore it's not 1963 anymore now
[3:09:13.880 --> 3:09:17.720]  people can harness the power of info wars the power of the internet
[3:09:17.720 --> 3:09:21.640]  and a dozen other alternative uh me well let's say i mean it's the autistic
[3:09:21.640 --> 3:09:25.480]  keyboard army the media says we say that meanly no they call themselves that
[3:09:25.480 --> 3:09:29.400]  that'll do it 25 hours a day i know there's only 24 it's a joke for the
[3:09:29.400 --> 3:09:32.920]  young turks seven how many hours are in a day the 25 hours a day it's like 110
[3:09:32.920 --> 3:09:36.280]  percent uh that they will go in there and find every piece of data you cannot
[3:09:36.280 --> 3:09:39.560]  stop them no it's actually exciting in the
[3:09:39.560 --> 3:09:43.800]  sense that it's a tragedy of course that uh this awful loss of life
[3:09:43.800 --> 3:09:47.160]  but what we're seeing is citizen democracy in action
[3:09:47.160 --> 3:09:50.840]  we no longer have to buy the bs of the mainstream media
[3:09:50.840 --> 3:09:54.520]  who will give us the government sanitized version of what happened in
[3:09:54.520 --> 3:10:00.120]  las vegas we will collectively we will get to the bottom of this and we will
[3:10:00.120 --> 3:10:03.800]  find out exactly what happened that's right it's an information total
[3:10:03.800 --> 3:10:07.640]  revolution like 1776 but squared to the next
[3:10:07.640 --> 3:10:11.160]  level it's beautiful it's incredible it's unstoppable
[3:10:11.160 --> 3:10:15.080]  well and uh i think you put it right in the first uh in the opening here with
[3:10:15.080 --> 3:10:19.000]  this is beginning to smell more and more like some kind of gun
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:23.400]  running operation uh isn't odd that this fellow
[3:10:23.400 --> 3:10:27.480]  has no history whatsoever of any social media contact
[3:10:27.480 --> 3:10:32.520]  that would be typical of a government agent an fbi agent for example or a
[3:10:32.520 --> 3:10:37.240]  dea agent that he has no record as a gun enthusiast
[3:10:37.240 --> 3:10:41.320]  yet he has a veritable arsenal in his room an arsenal
[3:10:41.320 --> 3:10:46.120]  no one saw him bring in and no one saw him bring ammunition or any of the other
[3:10:46.120 --> 3:10:52.840]  necessary pieces the elaborate filming uh apparatus and so on how very
[3:10:52.840 --> 3:10:58.120]  strange uh and then we track him undeniably to an anti-trump rally
[3:10:58.120 --> 3:11:03.160]  actually two different anti-trump rallies two different events i think that
[3:11:03.160 --> 3:11:05.480]  that's a this is like lee hardy oswald at the
[3:11:05.480 --> 3:11:09.160]  communist rallies well it very well he could have been
[3:11:09.160 --> 3:11:13.720]  put there as a plant that's entirely well he worked at lockheed and it looks
[3:11:13.720 --> 3:11:18.120]  like skunkworks connected areas and nasa i mean this is classic lee harvey
[3:11:18.120 --> 3:11:21.960]  oswald lee harvey oswald worked at the at the u2
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:26.520]  uh proto skunkworks well and as you know they told us in the
[3:11:26.520 --> 3:11:30.040]  war and commission he was a known communist then why was he handing out
[3:11:30.040 --> 3:11:34.120]  anti-communist literature in new orleans going out of his way to get in a
[3:11:34.120 --> 3:11:37.480]  scuffle arrested taken to the new orleans police station
[3:11:37.480 --> 3:11:41.480]  he's allowed one phone call does he call his lawyers he call his wife
[3:11:41.480 --> 3:11:45.720]  no he calls the head of the fbi and in 30 minutes he sprung with no charges
[3:11:45.720 --> 3:11:49.640]  hmm how curious it's all in the man who killed kennedy
[3:11:49.640 --> 3:11:55.320]  the the case against lbj but i i do see these strange parallels alex the
[3:11:55.320 --> 3:12:00.200]  difference is now you have a crusading independent alternative
[3:12:00.200 --> 3:12:04.440]  uh uh uh journalistic tradition in this country that's taken root
[3:12:04.440 --> 3:12:07.480]  through the internet and they're not going to be able to pull the wall over
[3:12:07.480 --> 3:12:11.000]  our eyes we're going to get to the bottom this and i don't even think we've
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:15.240]  begun in terms of ferreting out the facts i salute
[3:12:15.240 --> 3:12:19.160]  laura lumar the i like to call her little laura lumar because hillary
[3:12:19.160 --> 3:12:22.520]  clinton and huma abdin are so deathly afraid of her

[3:20:14.600 --> 3:20:19.080]  here's some breaking news a group of republicans
[3:20:19.080 --> 3:20:22.840]  in new york's 18th congressional district
[3:20:22.840 --> 3:20:30.520]  have approached the singer celebrity joy via about being the republican candidate
[3:20:30.520 --> 3:20:34.440]  for congress to oppose a democratic congressman
[3:20:34.440 --> 3:20:41.240]  shawn maloney in that district via is of course a native new yorker and
[3:20:41.240 --> 3:20:45.240]  evidently a number of her admirers are
[3:20:45.240 --> 3:20:49.480]  imploring her to return to her home state and
[3:20:49.480 --> 3:20:52.920]  seek that congressional seat no word yet whether
[3:20:52.920 --> 3:20:56.840]  via is interested or whether she's going to consider it but
[3:20:56.840 --> 3:21:00.280]  having met her recently in las vegas at a
[3:21:00.280 --> 3:21:05.800]  conservative political action conference i can tell you she is one
[3:21:05.800 --> 3:21:10.120]  impressive articulate beautiful conservative
[3:21:10.120 --> 3:21:13.960]  woman and she'd make a heck of a candidate so i'm hoping
[3:21:13.960 --> 3:21:19.720]  just on a personal level that she makes the race now shawn maloney is a
[3:21:19.720 --> 3:21:23.960]  very smart capable guy very articulate
[3:21:23.960 --> 3:21:28.280]  advocate for his own liberal point of view it would be a
[3:21:28.280 --> 3:21:33.240]  classic classic race well the entire world remains
[3:21:33.240 --> 3:21:37.480]  focused on las vegas confusion after the terrors
[3:21:37.480 --> 3:21:42.520]  the terror act there not even three full days have passed since this revolting
[3:21:42.520 --> 3:21:47.720]  attack in las vegas and the story inconsistencies and the
[3:21:47.720 --> 3:21:51.000]  number of conspiracy theories that are sprouting like
[3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:54.760]  mushrooms on decayed wood are really quite
[3:21:54.760 --> 3:21:59.240]  extraordinary word comes from the la times
[3:21:59.240 --> 3:22:03.000]  that steven paddock was a regular at the virgin
[3:22:03.000 --> 3:22:08.440]  river casino starbucks in mesquite nevada that he
[3:22:08.440 --> 3:22:13.320]  gambled very large sums very strange for a man
[3:22:13.320 --> 3:22:16.840]  who were told was a retired accountant with
[3:22:16.840 --> 3:22:20.280]  no activity of either gun enthusiasm or
[3:22:20.280 --> 3:22:26.040]  political activity he was seen there many times with his companion
[3:22:26.040 --> 3:22:30.600]  a filipino woman named mary lou danley
[3:22:30.600 --> 3:22:37.720]  and one barista told the la times that he often saw paddock abusing
[3:22:37.720 --> 3:22:43.240]  den danley he was nasty mean to her quoting things like
[3:22:43.240 --> 3:22:46.360]  i'm paying for your drink just like i'm paying
[3:22:46.360 --> 3:22:52.280]  for you um but then unabashedly danley would step down and say
[3:22:52.280 --> 3:22:58.200]  okay uh so looking at paddock's own words albeit here say
[3:22:58.200 --> 3:23:03.400]  via a starbucks barista he was paying for mary lou
[3:23:03.400 --> 3:23:09.160]  danley like paying for a cup of coffee uh and um it is uh i think
[3:23:09.160 --> 3:23:12.920]  gives us some insights into his psyche
[3:23:12.920 --> 3:23:17.240]  taking it face value we know that he doesn't like to be alone
[3:23:17.240 --> 3:23:21.480]  we know the service he pays for are not real and more so
[3:23:21.480 --> 3:23:25.960]  having a paid companion prohibits ability to find any truly meaningful
[3:23:25.960 --> 3:23:29.560]  relationship but i doubt the man cares now
[3:23:29.560 --> 3:23:34.040]  is this all psycho babble yes to a certain extent we are
[3:23:34.040 --> 3:23:38.360]  all guessing but there's an army of citizen journalists out there and the
[3:23:38.360 --> 3:23:42.120]  digging has begun and we already begun to find
[3:23:42.120 --> 3:23:48.280]  holes in the uh seemingly inconsistent and most definitely incomplete
[3:23:48.280 --> 3:23:53.080]  official narrative as to what really happened here who
[3:23:53.080 --> 3:23:57.000]  steven paddock really is whether he is in fact
[3:23:57.000 --> 3:24:01.400]  the shooter whether he is in fact the only shooter
[3:24:01.400 --> 3:24:05.480]  since you have different shooting stations uh some
[3:24:05.480 --> 3:24:09.400]  uh of those with much greater gun experience
[3:24:09.400 --> 3:24:12.920]  uh than i have have questioned his ability to move
[3:24:12.920 --> 3:24:16.040]  quickly enough between stations giving the weight
[3:24:16.040 --> 3:24:22.680]  and mobility of the weapons he was using uh laura lumar i think uh was among
[3:24:22.680 --> 3:24:27.320]  those who pointed out uh that we uh we have uh
[3:24:27.320 --> 3:24:33.720]  evidence of a woman a second guest in paddock's room or room three two one
[3:24:33.720 --> 3:24:37.880]  three five but we still have no official explanation of
[3:24:37.880 --> 3:24:41.880]  who this woman was whether she was potentially
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:45.880]  a prostitute or a confederate uh and then
[3:24:45.880 --> 3:24:49.080]  there is the double order of the receipt now
[3:24:49.080 --> 3:24:55.400]  the fbi insists that paddock checked into the mandalay bay resort on
[3:24:55.400 --> 3:25:00.520]  september 28th 2017 uh you can see this repeated over
[3:25:00.520 --> 3:25:04.440]  and over and over again by the mainstream media
[3:25:04.440 --> 3:25:08.760]  uh new york magazine only a couple hours ago repeating that date
[3:25:08.760 --> 3:25:14.120]  yet if we look at the actual receipt from the mandalay bay hotel
[3:25:14.120 --> 3:25:17.720]  we see that it's actually dated september 27th
[3:25:17.720 --> 3:25:24.280]  2017 now this is gasoline for the conspiracy uh fire
[3:25:24.280 --> 3:25:28.600]  this is what leads people to jump to uh a broad
[3:25:28.600 --> 3:25:33.080]  distrust of both the mainstream media and the federal and state governments
[3:25:33.080 --> 3:25:38.520]  who feed us this nonsense why would the authorities mislead the public
[3:25:38.520 --> 3:25:42.200]  about something so simple as his check-in date
[3:25:42.200 --> 3:25:45.640]  and if they're misleading us about this what else
[3:25:45.640 --> 3:25:51.880]  are they misleading us about now from the dark recesses of the internet comes
[3:25:51.880 --> 3:25:55.640]  even more unvetted connections but some of these
[3:25:55.640 --> 3:26:00.760]  leads are so incredible i have to share it kind of starts with the
[3:26:00.760 --> 3:26:05.800]  disgraced california state senator an ex-state senator named lee lin yee
[3:26:05.800 --> 3:26:10.360]  yee was arrested and convicted after a five to a five-year sentence
[3:26:10.360 --> 3:26:15.320]  for accepting bribes and trafficking arms through yes you guessed it
[3:26:15.320 --> 3:26:21.480]  the philippines uh with more than 20 uh firearms found in paddock's rooms
[3:26:21.480 --> 3:26:25.240]  it seems uh that uh there may have been some
[3:26:25.240 --> 3:26:32.280]  effort uh that ties uh the philippines uh the girlfriend to a gun
[3:26:32.280 --> 3:26:40.200]  running operation akin to fast and furious we are looking into this a
[3:26:40.200 --> 3:26:45.320]  37 137 page affidavit which was the results of a five-year
[3:26:45.320 --> 3:26:49.960]  investigation on lee lin yee which was made public by the fbi
[3:26:49.960 --> 3:26:52.680]  soon as after his arrest revealed the senator
[3:26:52.680 --> 3:26:56.280]  was allegedly proactive in dealing arms through
[3:26:56.280 --> 3:27:01.080]  uh the philippines uh through muslim groups there
[3:27:01.080 --> 3:27:04.920]  whether we can establish any tie uh to
[3:27:04.920 --> 3:27:09.400]  steven paddock remains to be seen but we at info ours are working
[3:27:09.400 --> 3:27:14.440]  assiduously on this story uh the reason that i bring this up
[3:27:14.440 --> 3:27:19.000]  is to clearly state that the fbi is still known to track an attempt
[3:27:19.000 --> 3:27:24.280]  international buyers and sellers of guns particularly the drug lords and
[3:27:24.280 --> 3:27:27.800]  terrorists the fast and furious gun walking scandal
[3:27:27.800 --> 3:27:33.960]  was the result of just one such effort going all the way back to 2009
[3:27:33.960 --> 3:27:37.880]  lee lin lee is a more current example 2016
[3:27:37.880 --> 3:27:41.080]  there can be little doubt that such activity
[3:27:41.080 --> 3:27:47.240]  still uh is going on uh yet uh we come to an impasse
[3:27:47.240 --> 3:27:50.520]  when it comes to getting any answers about steven
[3:27:50.520 --> 3:27:55.080]  paddock we are going to be uh staying on top of this
[3:27:55.080 --> 3:27:59.640]  we don't know whether some kind of deal was going down at mandalay bay
[3:27:59.640 --> 3:28:03.080]  do we don't know whether the feds know more about this than they are telling
[3:28:03.080 --> 3:28:07.800]  us we know we're not getting the straight story because of so many
[3:28:07.800 --> 3:28:12.680]  holes in the official versions so far many people who were on the terrible
[3:28:12.680 --> 3:28:15.640]  site that night say that they personally witnessed
[3:28:15.640 --> 3:28:20.760]  multiple shooters and therein lies a deep problem problem

[3:33:02.440 --> 3:33:06.040]  from the front lines of the information war
[3:33:06.040 --> 3:33:13.320]  it's alex jones
[3:33:13.320 --> 3:33:19.640]  welcome back i'm roger stone sitting in for alex jones and you're on the alex
[3:33:19.640 --> 3:33:24.920]  jones show here at info wars uh as the robert muller investigation
[3:33:24.920 --> 3:33:28.360]  and testifies new details are coming out every day
[3:33:28.360 --> 3:33:33.560]  about that direction of that uh very controversial probe
[3:33:33.560 --> 3:33:38.280]  but buried in the story may be some intense legal problems
[3:33:38.280 --> 3:33:44.440]  with the warrant uh that was uh laid on paul manifor
[3:33:44.440 --> 3:33:50.840]  when his apartment was uh uh rated at at five o'clock in the morning by the
[3:33:50.840 --> 3:33:54.600]  fbi at the behest of special counselor
[3:33:54.600 --> 3:33:59.560]  muller it seems that muller's team obtained evidence
[3:33:59.560 --> 3:34:04.600]  not on the listed warrant as required by law
[3:34:04.600 --> 3:34:11.400]  and in fact uh in the july 26th uh raid uh the fbi
[3:34:11.400 --> 3:34:15.800]  may have removed uh materials covered by the attorney
[3:34:15.800 --> 3:34:21.880]  client privilege that could uh in fact take the entire
[3:34:21.880 --> 3:34:27.480]  taking of evidence during the raid uh we have uh
[3:34:27.480 --> 3:34:34.520]  numerous precedents uh of judges very recently saying that to sweeping
[3:34:34.520 --> 3:34:39.800]  uh a warrant violates the fourth amendment so in other words robert
[3:34:39.800 --> 3:34:44.120]  muller's bully boy tactics which were orchestrated by
[3:34:44.120 --> 3:34:48.600]  investigator adam weisman may now backfire on
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:55.080]  uh his inquiry in to the president um the other
[3:34:55.080 --> 3:34:58.920]  major development that i think bears attention
[3:34:58.920 --> 3:35:03.160]  was uh a little known comment by uh general
[3:35:03.160 --> 3:35:08.520]  john kelly in the washington post only this past week
[3:35:08.520 --> 3:35:12.520]  kelly said that all policy initiatives
[3:35:12.520 --> 3:35:16.360]  now would go to white house aide mark
[3:35:16.360 --> 3:35:20.520]  short now mark short formerly worked for the
[3:35:20.520 --> 3:35:26.360]  coke brothers comes out of the americans for prosperity
[3:35:26.360 --> 3:35:30.840]  uh a non-profit organization funded by the coax
[3:35:30.840 --> 3:35:34.760]  the coax you'll remember are no particular fans
[3:35:34.760 --> 3:35:41.000]  of donald j trump and they opposed his nomination uh as the republican
[3:35:41.000 --> 3:35:46.600]  nominee for president essentially until the bitter end
[3:35:46.600 --> 3:35:51.480]  what's interesting of course is that steven miller is the individual who
[3:35:51.480 --> 3:35:55.400]  still holds the title of director of policy uh in
[3:35:55.400 --> 3:35:59.080]  planning and under the white house flow chart all
[3:35:59.080 --> 3:36:04.920]  policy is supposed to flow to miller so was general
[3:36:04.920 --> 3:36:09.800]  kelly giving us the early heads up that steven miller the last
[3:36:09.800 --> 3:36:16.120]  remaining trump campaign veteran the man who uh who's eloquence and
[3:36:16.120 --> 3:36:19.960]  who's writing talents so incredibly punched up
[3:36:19.960 --> 3:36:23.720]  the president's superb address at the united nations
[3:36:23.720 --> 3:36:27.960]  only weeks ago uh is miller himself the last
[3:36:27.960 --> 3:36:32.520]  standing trumpite inside the trump white house
[3:36:32.520 --> 3:36:38.840]  not long for this world that would be uh after the departure of
[3:36:38.840 --> 3:36:43.960]  steven k bannon uh after the downgrading of peter
[3:36:43.960 --> 3:36:47.800]  navarro the president's special trade
[3:36:47.800 --> 3:36:51.720]  representative uh and we have to wonder whether
[3:36:51.720 --> 3:36:56.040]  miller who we refer to as the minister of propaganda
[3:36:56.040 --> 3:37:00.840]  uh and we say that affectionately is long for this world or whether there is
[3:37:00.840 --> 3:37:06.440]  some lateral transfer uh in mind for mr miller
[3:37:06.440 --> 3:37:13.560]  we here at info wars are fans of uh steven miller because of his ability
[3:37:13.560 --> 3:37:17.640]  to handle the mainstream media in a most
[3:37:17.640 --> 3:37:20.600]  efficient manner if you've ever seen this guy
[3:37:20.600 --> 3:37:26.680]  stand up in a press scrum he is nothing short of brilliant but more importantly
[3:37:26.680 --> 3:37:29.960]  he completely understands the president's mind
[3:37:29.960 --> 3:37:33.560]  he's completely copacetic with the president when it comes
[3:37:33.560 --> 3:37:40.360]  to the agenda for reform in this country he is the last remaining true
[3:37:40.360 --> 3:37:46.120]  loyal trumpite in the building it will be a tremendous tragedy
[3:37:46.120 --> 3:37:50.120]  if general kelly who is succeeding based on all reports
[3:37:50.120 --> 3:37:54.280]  in bringing down an iron curtain around the president
[3:37:54.280 --> 3:38:00.280]  cutting him off from longtime associates political supporters campaign staff and
[3:38:00.280 --> 3:38:03.880]  yes in some instances cutting him off from his very
[3:38:03.880 --> 3:38:08.520]  own family it will be a tragedy if mr miller
[3:38:08.520 --> 3:38:12.440]  joins the ranks of those who've been squeezed out
[3:38:12.440 --> 3:38:17.160]  of the uh of the trump white house seen uh in
[3:38:17.160 --> 3:38:24.360]  washington yesterday uh miller had no comment on these press reports
[3:38:24.360 --> 3:38:28.680]  i do want to mention to you uh now that secret 12
[3:38:28.680 --> 3:38:32.200]  which i have found to be without any question the best
[3:38:32.200 --> 3:38:40.680]  multi vitamin and mineral formula out there b12 specifically
[3:38:40.680 --> 3:38:47.560]  is probably 40 off probably the greatest sale ever on this product now
[3:38:47.560 --> 3:38:56.120]  b12 is absolutely necessary for for for cultivating the energy if you will
[3:38:56.120 --> 3:39:00.440]  it's in my daily regimen and i have looked
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:05.560]  at the labels of the b12 supplements you can buy at the local wall greens
[3:39:05.560 --> 3:39:10.760]  or cvs and i can tell you that alex jones and the folks at info wars put
[3:39:10.760 --> 3:39:16.040]  nothing at the info wars dot com site that isn't the very best of the
[3:39:16.040 --> 3:39:19.320]  best that doesn't have not only the best natural
[3:39:19.320 --> 3:39:24.840]  ingredients but is tested and retested and in many cases
[3:39:24.840 --> 3:39:29.240]  have thousands of testimonials from satisfied customers
[3:39:29.240 --> 3:39:33.640]  this is what alex jones calls a 360-degree win because
[3:39:33.640 --> 3:39:38.760]  you get not only good effective efficient products at a good price
[3:39:38.760 --> 3:39:42.760]  but you're propping up our war against censorship
[3:39:42.760 --> 3:39:46.920]  you're backing us in the fight against the mainstream media who if they had
[3:39:46.920 --> 3:39:51.080]  their way would snuff us the tech left the
[3:39:51.080 --> 3:39:58.280]  yahoo's the amazons the googles who would try to censor us if they could
[3:39:58.280 --> 3:40:03.240]  you see we don't have a george soros standing in the

[3:40:06.680 --> 3:40:12.280]  we can't count on the ford foundation the rockefeller foundation no

[3:47:20.120 --> 3:47:23.560]  the alex jones show where i'm sitting in for my
[3:47:23.560 --> 3:47:30.200]  friend and fellow patriot alex jones a major story that we broke here at info
[3:47:30.200 --> 3:47:34.120]  wars dot com involved the former chinese
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:41.000]  intelligence agent miles quack uh and the efforts uh to keep this
[3:47:41.000 --> 3:47:45.000]  hillary clinton bundler uh and george
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:50.600]  soros associate uh who's currently living in the united states illegally in
[3:47:50.600 --> 3:47:55.880]  new york city from being extradited to the chinese
[3:47:55.880 --> 3:48:02.200]  homeland uh as we discussed when we broke the story here on info wars
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:08.680]  it got major international coverage and here is an important update uh
[3:48:08.680 --> 3:48:14.360]  evidently uh mr quack uh went to washington dc today where he was
[3:48:14.360 --> 3:48:17.720]  supposed to speak to the neocon think tank
[3:48:17.720 --> 3:48:23.080]  the hudson institute at the last minute i believe at the behest of our state
[3:48:23.080 --> 3:48:28.440]  department that speech was canceled uh we also
[3:48:28.440 --> 3:48:34.600]  learned that quack was to hold a press conference at the national press club
[3:48:34.600 --> 3:48:39.400]  today and evidently again from governmental pressure
[3:48:39.400 --> 3:48:46.120]  that event was also canceled now we reported that quack has deep ties to
[3:48:46.120 --> 3:48:50.440]  iran and the united arab emirates uh in my
[3:48:50.440 --> 3:48:55.400]  opinion he is a national security risk but more importantly he's become a
[3:48:55.400 --> 3:49:00.920]  sticking point in syno u.s relations when president
[3:49:00.920 --> 3:49:06.040]  trump met in palm beach with gia the presidential
[3:49:06.040 --> 3:49:12.600]  pardon me the chinese leader um this was one of the sticking points in getting
[3:49:12.600 --> 3:49:17.720]  chinese cooperation on the issue of north korea
[3:49:17.720 --> 3:49:21.560]  this past weekend secretary of state rex tillerson
[3:49:21.560 --> 3:49:26.120]  and deputy attorney general rod rozenstein visited
[3:49:26.120 --> 3:49:30.680]  bejing china uh and china agreed to even more
[3:49:30.680 --> 3:49:35.160]  sanctions on north korea out of those those meetings
[3:49:35.160 --> 3:49:39.240]  president donald trump deserves a lot of credit never in history
[3:49:39.240 --> 3:49:43.400]  has a u.s president gotten so much cooperation from china
[3:49:43.400 --> 3:49:47.960]  vis-a-vis north korea barack obama you will call attempted
[3:49:47.960 --> 3:49:54.840]  and failed but now this issue of quack came up at the meetings tillerson
[3:49:54.840 --> 3:49:58.600]  and rozenstein have both promised the chinese government
[3:49:58.600 --> 3:50:02.040]  that the chinese uh rogue intelligence agent
[3:50:02.040 --> 3:50:06.040]  turned obama pardon me a clinton bundler
[3:50:06.040 --> 3:50:12.040]  and longtime soros associate will be extradited to face criminal charges in
[3:50:12.040 --> 3:50:17.560]  china remember quack is found guilty of both financial crimes
[3:50:17.560 --> 3:50:22.360]  there and here but the chinese government has repeatedly told the trump
[3:50:22.360 --> 3:50:27.080]  white house they want quack extradited now quack is a
[3:50:27.080 --> 3:50:30.840]  sophisticated intelligence agent and with the help of
[3:50:30.840 --> 3:50:36.280]  super liberal democratic lawyer david boys you remember him
[3:50:36.280 --> 3:50:43.400]  he represented al gore in the 20 uh and the 2000 florida recount
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:47.960]  they have launched a counterintelligence scheme
[3:50:47.960 --> 3:50:53.160]  quack was being represented by a law firm uh on his asylum application
[3:50:53.160 --> 3:50:57.400]  in a last ditch attempt to avoid extradition to china
[3:50:57.400 --> 3:51:01.720]  my sources tell me that the law firm dumped quack because he lied on that
[3:51:01.720 --> 3:51:05.960]  application and he failed to disclose his criminal record
[3:51:05.960 --> 3:51:10.920]  in china quack then hired hackers to hack the law firm
[3:51:10.920 --> 3:51:15.320]  and released his asylum application on twitter
[3:51:15.320 --> 3:51:20.360]  now warmongers and anti trumpets in the government are using this to
[3:51:20.360 --> 3:51:27.720]  try to stop the extradition is it a odd that the national security advisor
[3:51:27.720 --> 3:51:34.040]  hr mcmaster with deep ties to a think tank funded by george soros
[3:51:34.040 --> 3:51:38.680]  seems to be the lone voice within the trump administration
[3:51:38.680 --> 3:51:45.160]  opposing extradition of quack a known soros associate
[3:51:45.160 --> 3:51:49.720]  once again quack traveled to the united states on a false passport
[3:51:49.720 --> 3:51:53.640]  he's in business with the iranian revolutionary guard
[3:51:53.640 --> 3:51:59.400]  and a national security risk the president is being undermined by
[3:51:59.400 --> 3:52:05.080]  mcmaster but appears that this could be
[3:52:05.080 --> 3:52:11.720]  leading to the extradition of mr quack and therefore greater
[3:52:11.720 --> 3:52:17.960]  chinese cooperation in our efforts to isolate the one they call
[3:52:17.960 --> 3:52:22.680]  rocket man let us look at the clock here if we can
[3:52:22.680 --> 3:52:28.760]  and let me say that we broke that story here on info wars
[3:52:28.760 --> 3:52:32.360]  and it was the shot heard around the world
[3:52:32.360 --> 3:52:36.120]  we will bring you the latest you won't read it in the
[3:52:36.120 --> 3:52:42.200]  washington post or in the new york times you see uh there a
[3:52:42.200 --> 3:52:46.920]  piece of agate prop by michael foresight of the new york times
[3:52:46.920 --> 3:52:50.760]  there are many in the mainstream media attempting
[3:52:50.760 --> 3:52:56.920]  to cover quacks tracks but we here at info wars have brought you the
[3:52:56.920 --> 3:53:03.240]  inside story imagine my shock this morning when i went to the mailbox
[3:53:03.240 --> 3:53:07.320]  and i opened the two invoices from the attorneys
[3:53:07.320 --> 3:53:10.920]  who represented me before the house intelligence
[3:53:10.920 --> 3:53:16.680]  committee only last week i had just seen their previous bills because as many
[3:53:16.680 --> 3:53:20.120]  of you know and as we broke right here at info wars
[3:53:20.120 --> 3:53:24.040]  dot com i'm being sued by an obama front
[3:53:24.040 --> 3:53:29.800]  organization called the project for democracy who have sued me
[3:53:29.800 --> 3:53:35.720]  donald trump and the trump campaign with the phony claim yet again
[3:53:35.720 --> 3:53:41.080]  that we assisted the russians in hacking the democratic national committee
[3:53:41.080 --> 3:53:45.480]  and then handed that material over to wiki leaks
[3:53:45.480 --> 3:53:52.040]  it's a falsehood folks it's a fraud a fairytale it never happened
[3:53:52.040 --> 3:53:56.440]  but that doesn't stop somebody in this case a large group of some buddies
[3:53:56.440 --> 3:54:00.440]  a group of fairly prominent attorneys all alum
[3:54:00.440 --> 3:54:04.520]  of the obama administration from filing a frivolous
[3:54:04.520 --> 3:54:08.680]  but detailed lawsuit against me a lawsuit by the way
[3:54:08.680 --> 3:54:12.920]  that contains no evidence of wrongdoing whatsoever
[3:54:12.920 --> 3:54:18.600]  it's merely a series of accusations well the bottom line folks is that my
[3:54:18.600 --> 3:54:22.360]  legal bills have now hit four hundred and twenty
[3:54:22.360 --> 3:54:26.680]  six thousand dollars yes that's what it costs
[3:54:26.680 --> 3:54:30.520]  just to defend yourself from the leftist onslaught
[3:54:30.520 --> 3:54:35.160]  i am uh being pursued not because i've done anything wrong
[3:54:35.160 --> 3:54:38.840]  but because i support donald trump and i'll never
[3:54:38.840 --> 3:54:42.360]  quit i'll never stop and they know it
[3:54:42.360 --> 3:54:45.720]  frankly i think this is all meant to be a distraction
[3:54:45.720 --> 3:54:48.760]  so if you want to help the stone family if you want to help with these
[3:54:48.760 --> 3:54:56.200]  exorbitant legal expenses you can go to stonedefensefund.com
[3:54:56.200 --> 3:55:00.200]  uh which will take you to who framed roger stone
[3:55:00.200 --> 3:55:03.560]  you see a brief description of the charges
[3:55:03.560 --> 3:55:09.640]  that i am fighting the phony charges i point out that i still have not heard
[3:55:09.640 --> 3:55:13.320]  from the us senate intelligence committee and i fully
[3:55:13.320 --> 3:55:18.760]  expect to testify there in the coming weeks or months
[3:55:18.760 --> 3:55:22.600]  which is why i'm highly confident my legal expenses
[3:55:22.600 --> 3:55:26.520]  are going to top a half million dollars now
[3:55:26.520 --> 3:55:30.520]  i am not a wealthy man my books do pretty well

[3:55:35.240 --> 3:55:40.680]  uh but i treasure my independence i turned down a dozen opportunities to
[3:55:40.680 --> 3:55:44.920]  join big washington lobbying firms where i could have traded my
[3:55:44.920 --> 3:55:48.920]  relationships in trump world for millions of dollars
[3:55:48.920 --> 3:55:52.280]  i did that in the 80s i have no interest in doing it
