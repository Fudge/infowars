[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.781]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:28.322]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours, and I'm sure we'll be in for the war room.
[00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:29.942]  That, of course, is 3 p.m.
[00:00:29.942 --> 00:00:30.582]  to 6 p.m.
[00:00:30.582 --> 00:00:31.383]  Central.
[00:00:31.383 --> 00:00:32.983]  This is the Info War.
[00:00:32.983 --> 00:00:36.804]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:47.886]  First off, I don't toot my horn for, I don't know, purposes of self-flagellation.
[00:00:51.323 --> 00:00:57.725]  Either way, you take a beating telling the truth, but it's something I've gotta do.
[00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:07.727]  I also don't take credit for the things we've broken here, because I want the attention.
[00:01:07.727 --> 00:01:14.909]  We just covered the best research and the best facts we have, because it's our duty to do so.
[00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.690]  And a lot of times I start the broadcast by saying my head's spinning,
[00:01:19.864 --> 00:01:24.105]  Because this place is a real war room in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:34.888]  We are really doing research, we really have the contacts, and we're really vetting the information as well, and sometimes it'll make your head spin.
[00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:39.889]  In fact, the information I've got right now is so powerful that I don't even think I can even do the show right now.
[00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:51.061]  I think I'm going to have to do some rebroadcast for a while and look at this information some more and then decide what I'm going to do because I've hit information overload at this point.
[00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:58.150]  But we've got a pretty good picture of what happened in Vegas and who's behind it and what unfolded here.
[00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:11.723]  But you can know this, the Deep State Democratic Party wing is 100% behind this thing and they are just a murdering pack of scum.
[00:02:11.723 --> 00:02:23.786]  I've also reviewed over an hour of footage shot by different people in the first 15 minutes of cell phone footage.
[00:02:25.162 --> 00:02:28.383]  Where people just have their cameras on or have their GoPros on.
[00:02:28.383 --> 00:02:31.263]  We're already there at the concert and we're in a rendering aid.
[00:02:31.263 --> 00:02:33.624]  And it's 100% real.
[00:02:33.624 --> 00:02:39.486]  You can see people fading out and dying there in Vegas in Sin City.
[00:02:39.486 --> 00:02:41.866]  Sacrificed on the altar of globalism.
[00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:44.147]  While laying, now don't show the footage guys.
[00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:45.427]  Don't even show it blurred.
[00:02:45.427 --> 00:02:50.568]  While laying on piles of garbage and beer cans.
[00:02:50.568 --> 00:02:52.089]  It's just the sight.
[00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:53.149]  I'll never get it out of my head.
[00:02:54.386 --> 00:03:02.133]  And I was really thinking about playing it this morning because I knew people were going to say this was crisis actors and fake.
[00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:04.755]  And then I knew they were going to say that I was saying that.
[00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:12.482]  I called Nico at about 8 this morning and I said, I may play this video because I want people to see the truth and know this really happened.
[00:03:12.482 --> 00:03:17.006]  And I'm not going to let them sit there and then try to say it didn't happen and then pin it on me.
[00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:21.157]  So it indeed did happen.
[00:03:21.157 --> 00:03:23.178]  Does that mean they don't stage events?
[00:03:23.178 --> 00:03:26.758]  Does it mean they didn't hire crisis actors for many of these Antifa events?
[00:03:26.758 --> 00:03:27.739]  That's been in the news.
[00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.639]  The groups are hiring online now.
[00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.520]  Does it mean sometimes they don't stage shootings?
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:44.922]  Remember in Taiwan, it's like 10 years ago, the president of Taiwan staged a shooting of himself when he was about to get impeached and got grazed by a bullet.
[00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:50.712]  And the other party made the police go check and it wasn't even a real wound, it had been staged.
[00:03:50.712 --> 00:03:53.613]  So, that stuff goes on.
[00:03:53.613 --> 00:03:57.154]  And the headline will be, Alex Jones questions Vegas.
[00:03:57.154 --> 00:04:02.716]  Well, they lied about babies in incubators in Iraq and got us into a huge war that killed over a million Iraqis.
[00:04:02.716 --> 00:04:09.158]  So, it's okay to question, like I question where I'm going to step as I walk down the street to make sure I'm not stepping in a pothole.
[00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:11.539]  But I have looked at this Vegas situation.
[00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:21.067]  And I've looked at the footage, and I've looked at it shot by scores of people, more than I should have watched, because it hurt my brain, and it was real.
[00:04:21.067 --> 00:04:26.613]  People fading out, fading away in piles of garbage with bullet holes in them.
[00:04:27.887 --> 00:04:29.127]  Very, very, very sad.
[00:04:29.127 --> 00:04:31.228]  Very, very painful.
[00:04:31.228 --> 00:04:33.268]  And just tore my guts out.
[00:04:33.268 --> 00:04:34.809]  And we're going to talk about it all today.
[00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:37.529]  We have the big news of what's behind this and more.
[00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:42.990]  This is, as everybody's noticing right now, the critical juncture of the research and documentation.
[00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.251]  Just look at Drudge with the top link.
[00:04:46.251 --> 00:04:52.713]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:05.329]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in InfoWars live broadcasting.
[00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:07.871]  We are live weekdays from 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:14.214]  Central at InfoWars.com slash show and this YouTube channel right here that you've landed on.
[00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:17.356]  Please subscribe to the channel for updates and notifications.
[00:05:17.356 --> 00:05:20.238]  You can follow us on Twitter at War Room Show.
[00:05:20.698 --> 00:05:23.821]  We are going to have the most powerful guest, the most powerful host.
[00:05:23.821 --> 00:05:28.986]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly, as well as taking your phone calls.
[00:05:28.986 --> 00:05:32.590]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.513]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[00:05:35.513 --> 00:05:36.774]  This is The War Room.
[00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.831]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:20.921]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:32.662 --> 00:06:40.085]  Well, October 1st came and went, and with it the biggest massacre using firearms in modern history.
[00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:44.107]  There's 59 dead now, 500 plus wounded, many others fighting for their lives.
[00:06:44.107 --> 00:06:48.689]  Be sure and pray for the victims, pray for the survivors, pray for their families.
[00:06:50.046 --> 00:07:03.729]  But you think about the carnage of 600 people roughly shot, 59 dead, and you think about the communists in China killing 84 million people according to their own publications.
[00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.969]  The CIA says it's 65 million from what they've got.
[00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:16.071]  And they fed the communist army off giant cookpots cooking the people they'd executed, including children with families.
[00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:19.146]  That was the preferred meat.
[00:07:19.146 --> 00:07:31.152]  That is declassified, that is in official books, published by the Communist Party of China, blaming the dictator's wife for it all.
[00:07:31.152 --> 00:07:35.735]  Yes, they had a quote, reform, after that.
[00:07:35.735 --> 00:07:39.657]  Communism killed 94 million in the 20th century, feels need to kill again.
[00:07:41.414 --> 00:07:48.641]  Now that said, so just imagine the magnitude of what happens in countries where people are disarmed.
[00:07:48.641 --> 00:07:54.487]  Congressman Scalise that barely survived the Democratic Party targeting
[00:07:55.879 --> 00:08:03.344]  Where they intended to pin in the Republican Congressman in that dugout and kill 15 of them so they could force a special election.
[00:08:03.344 --> 00:08:07.727]  That didn't go the way they wanted to in their Democratic Party operation.
[00:08:07.727 --> 00:08:12.070]  Where the New York Times advertised where to go, what to do, they didn't have security.
[00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:17.113]  Well there was security there and a good guy with a gun stopped the bad guy with a gun.
[00:08:17.113 --> 00:08:25.679]  And Congressman Scalise has come out and said what happened to him fortifies his belief in the Second Amendment because it was the Second Amendment that stopped that piece of garbage.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.442]  You gonna ban cars?
[00:08:27.442 --> 00:08:31.228]  Because Al-Qaeda and ISIS are using them to kill thousands of people a year now?
[00:08:31.228 --> 00:08:36.516]  You gonna not drive your car because it's insensitive because it'll remind somebody?
[00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.598]  They're saying the same thing.
[00:08:37.598 --> 00:08:38.620]  Get rid of your guns.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.403]  You should feel like you've done something wrong.
[00:08:42.145 --> 00:08:50.627]  They're foisting this guilt down on all of us, and it's a horrible assault, and Michelle Obama has come out and said white people are the problem.
[00:08:50.627 --> 00:08:52.507]  Yes, we have video.
[00:08:52.507 --> 00:08:54.248]  Hillary said the same thing.
[00:08:54.248 --> 00:08:57.989]  They are making their move for race war in America.
[00:08:57.989 --> 00:08:59.469]  It's cold-blooded.
[00:08:59.469 --> 00:09:01.650]  It's admitted in the WikiLeaks.
[00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:09.211]  But here, ladies and gentlemen, is the good news.
[00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:10.272]  This is not 1995, where they can
[00:09:12.233 --> 00:09:30.724]  Carry out an event like Oklahoma City that was a real bomb but was staged by criminal elements of the federal government working with German intelligence and a major tax-free foundation who's recently been caught with a lot of money overseas.
[00:09:30.724 --> 00:09:33.406]  Yes.
[00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.527]  The Southern Poverty Law Center was running L.A.
[00:09:35.527 --> 00:09:36.848]  City where the attack came out of.
[00:09:36.848 --> 00:09:38.409]  They weren't infiltrating it.
[00:09:38.409 --> 00:09:40.090]  They ran it.
[00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.131]  They commanded it.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.581]  This is not 1995.
[00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:58.947]  I launched this operation in 1995 to counter just such events as false flags and Waco and other events where we're lied to.
[00:09:58.947 --> 00:10:03.589]  And you can see the power of the individual, working with other individuals, what we've now done.
[00:10:03.589 --> 00:10:07.751]  But if you go to DrugsReport.com today, here's the big news.
[00:10:07.751 --> 00:10:14.375]  I've got more coming, probably in the third hour, fourth hour, but I've got to continue to research some areas of the
[00:10:16.107 --> 00:10:20.290]  The data line, the research line, we're going down before I release this information.
[00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.132]  We don't just put things out here to be sensational.
[00:10:23.132 --> 00:10:26.954]  We put it out because it's the truth.
[00:10:26.954 --> 00:10:30.496]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:32.658]  Look at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:10:32.658 --> 00:10:37.261]  Sheriff, did shooter get radicalized?
[00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:39.362]  They're coming out saying they're looking into radicalization.
[00:10:39.362 --> 00:10:43.625]  That's because in the hotel room was Antifa and Islamic literature.
[00:10:45.848 --> 00:10:51.190]  And because of our FBI sources, that's being forced out in the open.
[00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.031]  What did we tell you on Monday?
[00:10:53.031 --> 00:10:57.493]  That he was probably on SSRIs or some other type of anti-psychotic?
[00:10:57.493 --> 00:11:02.155]  Today it's confirmed he was.
[00:11:02.155 --> 00:11:04.036]  We're not sure he's the only guy.
[00:11:04.036 --> 00:11:05.697]  That's what's coming up later.
[00:11:06.974 --> 00:11:11.997]  A lot of evidence points towards him being part of a sting operation and being set up, just like Tim McVeigh.
[00:11:11.997 --> 00:11:16.179]  They run the same formulas over and over again, but we're going there later.
[00:11:16.179 --> 00:11:33.528]  Right now, we have Colonel Schaeffer, high-level intelligence, concurring with the analysis and saying that his experts in the government and experts in psychological warfare believe this guy was an Antifa radical.
[00:11:35.097 --> 00:11:41.662]  Had accomplices and had been wound up to carry out this attack for many reasons, but number one, his age.
[00:11:41.662 --> 00:11:43.403]  Number two, the target.
[00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:45.485]  The motive is the target.
[00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:48.027]  The target is the motive.
[00:11:48.027 --> 00:12:02.919]  You also have top forensic psychiatrists used by the federal government who examined many other mass shooters, including what happened with the Scalise shooting, and he says all the evidence points towards it being a PSYOP run by
[00:12:04.218 --> 00:12:05.483]  Liberals basically, the Democratic Party.
[00:12:06.923 --> 00:12:13.188]  That's where all the smart money is, is that this guy was a front man for a larger submerged operation.
[00:12:13.188 --> 00:12:26.658]  The hotel and complex is owned by Super Antifa slash Islamist supporters who are huge donors to the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups including the big Muslim Affairs Group here in the U.S.
[00:12:26.658 --> 00:12:27.519]  CARE.
[00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:30.441]  They would match all the employees' money if they gave to it.
[00:12:30.441 --> 00:12:33.804]  And I'm just saying that that should all be investigated.
[00:12:33.804 --> 00:12:34.525]  The insurance
[00:12:35.285 --> 00:12:36.685]  All of it should be looked at.
[00:12:36.685 --> 00:12:42.426]  And the fact that there was cameras in the hallways, and he was there five days, and had visitors, and guns everywhere.
[00:12:42.426 --> 00:12:46.207]  When you check into a hotel, they come and search your things when you leave.
[00:12:46.207 --> 00:12:47.207]  They always do.
[00:12:47.207 --> 00:12:48.427]  Especially casinos.
[00:12:48.427 --> 00:12:50.968]  Then they come back in when they clean it, and they do it.
[00:12:50.968 --> 00:12:56.349]  And if you don't clean it, if you don't put the sign up for a day, they'll still come in.
[00:12:56.349 --> 00:12:58.309]  That's protocol!
[00:12:58.309 --> 00:13:00.709]  They violated their default protocol.
[00:13:00.709 --> 00:13:03.290]  Where's all the surveillance footage?
[00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.430]  Where is all the footage?
[00:13:06.476 --> 00:13:11.703]  Well it turns out we have moles inside the hotel thanks to Laura Loomer and other folks working their Twitter contacts.
[00:13:11.703 --> 00:13:16.631]  We're working our Twitter contacts at RealAlexJones and of course at Prison Planet with Paul Watson.
[00:13:17.932 --> 00:13:21.114]  So you got the sheriff saying we're looking at him being radicalized.
[00:13:21.114 --> 00:13:22.895]  That's because they've got the evidence.
[00:13:22.895 --> 00:13:27.958]  And the sheriff shakes when he says it because he's so freaked out by the magnitude.
[00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.700]  They're being told don't give out more details because of an investigation by the feds.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:39.424]  But that's mid-level feds blocking who really did it because they're deep state plants of Obama, Clinton, and the globalists.
[00:13:39.424 --> 00:13:44.447]  And that's admitted that they're rebelling against the president and against the American people's attempt to take the country back.
[00:13:45.305 --> 00:13:52.527]  So imagine if it comes out this guy was anti-Islamically funded, which the evidence now is massively pointing to.
[00:13:52.527 --> 00:13:55.448]  I'll get to that in a moment.
[00:13:55.448 --> 00:13:59.909]  Imagine what's going to happen if all of that unfolds.
[00:13:59.909 --> 00:14:02.430]  Imagine what they're going to do.
[00:14:04.184 --> 00:14:15.249]  So, right now, they want to set the narrative, even though it's blown up in their face, that it's a white guy, and white guys are evil, and gun owners are evil, and so the victims are to blame.
[00:14:15.249 --> 00:14:17.150]  That's what they're saying.
[00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:22.432]  CBS executives, top Democrats, Hollywood stars, they're all putting that narrative out.
[00:14:22.432 --> 00:14:23.633]  We've got to take your guns.
[00:14:23.633 --> 00:14:25.053]  We've got to take your guns.
[00:14:25.053 --> 00:14:32.877]  Well, this is the reason why we need the guns to protect ourselves.
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:39.642]  So we have Colonel Schaefer coming out saying it looks like an Antifa Democrat operation.
[00:14:39.642 --> 00:14:41.823]  We've got the top psychiatrist saying it.
[00:14:41.823 --> 00:14:45.525]  We've got the sheriff saying it looks like radicalization because they know.
[00:14:45.525 --> 00:14:50.247]  But they're in the middle of an investigation and don't want accomplices to obviously know what they've got.
[00:14:50.247 --> 00:14:56.790]  But you've got to put this out now because it's politically being used to try to wound the country massively.
[00:14:58.288 --> 00:15:02.573]  But if you look at Drudge Report, remember, who told you all this on Monday?
[00:15:02.573 --> 00:15:05.596]  Who told you Sunday night, before it happened, it was coming?
[00:15:05.596 --> 00:15:08.199]  Who told you last Friday, with precision, it was coming?
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.502]  Who told you to look for the radicalization?
[00:15:11.502 --> 00:15:15.646]  And who told you on Monday morning from the HRT?
[00:15:15.646 --> 00:15:18.909]  Yeah folks, that's the kind of sources we've got.
[00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:31.321]  HRT on the ground, that the place was full of Antifa crud, as well as Islamist connections, and then it came out six hours later that indeed she'd gone to the Philippines, and indeed she'd gone to the Middle East.
[00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:34.326]  And indeed there was money being wired around everywhere else.
[00:15:34.326 --> 00:15:36.611]  And now it's all coming out.
[00:15:36.611 --> 00:15:38.013]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:38.013 --> 00:15:40.057]  Oh, and there was room service for two.
[00:15:40.057 --> 00:15:40.759]  A lot more.
[00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:43.223]  And he was on prescription drugs, like we told you he would.

[00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:56.263]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:18:56.263 --> 00:18:58.105]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[00:18:58.325 --> 00:19:01.187]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:19:01.187 --> 00:19:02.667]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:02.667 --> 00:19:09.511]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:09.511 --> 00:19:11.592]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:11.592 --> 00:19:21.297]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:19:21.297 --> 00:19:26.280]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:38.089]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:19:38.089 --> 00:19:41.412]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:19:41.412 --> 00:19:48.918]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:48.918 --> 00:19:51.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:41.328 --> 00:20:44.089]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:44.089 --> 00:20:49.011]  We have seen one of the biggest massacres in world history take place.
[00:20:49.011 --> 00:20:55.934]  But remember, an earthquake in somewhere like Pakistan can kill 15,000 people.
[00:20:55.934 --> 00:21:01.717]  A tsunami in the Pacific Ocean can kill 50,000 people.
[00:21:01.717 --> 00:21:05.318]  But then we just see the report and we move on a week later.
[00:21:05.318 --> 00:21:07.119]  With this event and this attack,
[00:21:08.151 --> 00:21:25.644]  The leftists, the globalists, the social engineers are going to use those dear lives of those poor people who were snuffed out to try to wound what's left of our republic and complete our journey into disarmament.
[00:21:25.644 --> 00:21:34.911]  And that's why we can't let this tragedy be used to destroy the country.
[00:21:34.911 --> 00:21:37.092]  You see the late night talk show host
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:55.986]  Posing as news reporters, the Colberts, the Kimmels, all of them, radicalize the alt-left, then the alt-left goes out and kills you, then their answer is gun control, and they try to disarm you.
[00:21:55.986 --> 00:21:57.727]  It's really that simple.
[00:21:57.727 --> 00:22:00.948]  But if you just joined us, we're going to go through in the next segment
[00:22:02.091 --> 00:22:21.971]  All the eyewitness reports and more, and we're going to have clips of the experts going through what the best minds have put together on this, and that's that you had a bunch of people helping the shooter, if he was indeed the shooter, that he was not acting alone, that much we know.
[00:22:21.971 --> 00:22:24.274]  We have hotel receipts now that
[00:22:26.391 --> 00:22:36.360]  They've been posted to Infowars.com via Laura Loomer, the incredible investigative journalist who's in there via Twitter talking to the hotel employees.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:47.651]  And she's getting the whole scoop on how they're SJWs, how they're anti-Trump, how they're working with the Southern Property Law Center, how they're doing fundraisers, how they're working with the Arab-American groups.
[00:22:47.651 --> 00:22:49.472]  I mean, this is official.
[00:22:49.472 --> 00:22:50.593]  This is their main push.
[00:22:51.733 --> 00:22:58.076]  And how this guy was able to do whatever he wanted with 20-plus guns inside the building, 40-plus total.
[00:22:58.076 --> 00:22:59.756]  Explosives we're now learning.
[00:22:59.756 --> 00:23:02.257]  Cameras inside the room, outside the room.
[00:23:02.257 --> 00:23:05.999]  Oh, and they didn't call hotel security.
[00:23:05.999 --> 00:23:09.580]  Every major hotel's got cameras hidden in the hallways.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:15.243]  A lot of casinos, they've caught them with bugs in the rooms just to see what you're doing if they want to tune in and hear.
[00:23:15.243 --> 00:23:16.423]  That's come out.
[00:23:16.423 --> 00:23:20.385]  I mean, they're the most surveilled place in the world other than, say, an NSA base.
[00:23:22.466 --> 00:23:25.128]  They're more surveilled than an airport!
[00:23:25.128 --> 00:23:26.129]  And this guy waltzes in.
[00:23:26.129 --> 00:23:29.732]  And what did we tell you Monday morning?
[00:23:29.732 --> 00:23:35.697]  I'd already gotten the calls Monday morning, but then I confirmed directly with the source.
[00:23:35.697 --> 00:23:38.999]  With the hostage rescue team of the FBI.
[00:23:38.999 --> 00:23:44.164]  I wouldn't be surprised if they don't send the FBI over here to try to shake me down to give up my source, which I'm not gonna do.
[00:23:44.164 --> 00:23:46.245]  I'm protected under the First Amendment.
[00:23:46.245 --> 00:23:49.368]  Despite what Obama tried to pull for eight years of imprisoning people.
[00:23:49.368 --> 00:23:50.749]  You'll never get my source.
[00:23:50.749 --> 00:23:51.730]  But they know it's real!
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.801]  They know.
[00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:57.822]  They know our secret service sources are real.
[00:23:57.822 --> 00:23:59.023]  They know our information is real.
[00:23:59.023 --> 00:24:00.244]  That's why they hate us.
[00:24:00.244 --> 00:24:01.944]  Because we're a danger to the globalists.
[00:24:01.944 --> 00:24:04.826]  We'll report what good sources give us.
[00:24:04.826 --> 00:24:15.072]  We've gotten great info from this particular HRT source two other times, even though I know the source through other sources to be a good person.
[00:24:16.291 --> 00:24:22.592]  And there's other good people in there, because they're the folks that actually do the killing, that actually do the rescuing, that actually do the work.
[00:24:22.592 --> 00:24:29.094]  They're not the little pinhead, pencil-pushing SJWs up above them.
[00:24:29.094 --> 00:24:35.275]  And they said they went in there, and that guy was shooting at them, and they shot him dead.
[00:24:35.275 --> 00:24:38.936]  That he didn't kill himself, and that he'd wounded two cops.
[00:24:38.936 --> 00:24:40.317]  That later came out in the news.
[00:24:40.317 --> 00:24:42.597]  You heard it here first!
[00:24:42.597 --> 00:24:45.018]  They shot the cops going in first.
[00:24:45.018 --> 00:24:45.718]  Both of them wounded.
[00:24:47.284 --> 00:24:53.545]  Now the transcript tapes, you hear the shots and they say, are those more shots fired?
[00:24:53.545 --> 00:24:59.046]  But the key is, they said there was Antifa literature all over the place.
[00:24:59.046 --> 00:25:02.107]  So much of it, it was almost like it was planted.
[00:25:02.107 --> 00:25:08.988]  And then, there was photos of trips to the Middle East.
[00:25:08.988 --> 00:25:09.948]  And that's all I got.
[00:25:09.948 --> 00:25:15.069]  And then, while I was on air, I got a text confirming the information yet again.
[00:25:16.141 --> 00:25:21.643]  And I told you that, that we need to have the police talk about, was he radicalized?
[00:25:21.643 --> 00:25:32.347]  Because it took them three days after San Bernardino, and later the FBI said, we were ordered to say it wasn't Islamic, and we're sick of it, two years before we were watching the couple.
[00:25:32.347 --> 00:25:37.009]  She was going to Saudi Arabia, she was going to Pakistan, they were going and getting radicalized.
[00:25:37.009 --> 00:25:38.789]  She wasn't even born here.
[00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:40.770]  She wasn't even a citizen.
[00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:43.991]  He was a citizen.
[00:25:43.991 --> 00:25:44.712]  Wasn't born here.
[00:25:45.714 --> 00:25:47.095]  The memory serves.
[00:25:47.095 --> 00:25:56.966]  And we were ordered to cover that up and when we wouldn't they started a criminal DOJ civil rights investigation of two federal marshals and an FBI agent.
[00:25:56.966 --> 00:26:01.630]  So they were watching this mosque because it was a radicalization center and you saw what happened.
[00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:06.916]  The neighbors wouldn't even report the bombs and the guns because they thought it was politically incorrect to do so.
[00:26:06.916 --> 00:26:07.897]  Plus they were probably scared.
[00:26:09.298 --> 00:26:14.624]  Major Hassan at Fort Hood, they wouldn't say it was an Islamic attack for almost four years.
[00:26:14.624 --> 00:26:20.411]  Same thing with all these other Army, Navy, Marine Corps recruiting center attacks and the Pulse nightclub.
[00:26:20.411 --> 00:26:25.637]  It took them years in the case of Hassan and days and weeks in other cases.
[00:26:25.637 --> 00:26:29.221]  So we're not just going to sit here while he's attacking
[00:26:30.382 --> 00:26:34.706]  A group of Trump supporters as the left sees it, and the left celebrated this.
[00:26:34.706 --> 00:26:40.311]  They see country music folks as one monolithic group of white people that like Trump, even though that's not even the case.
[00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:46.636]  Just like they said, Houston's all white, and they hope everybody dies in mainstream news, even though it's 70% minority.
[00:26:46.636 --> 00:26:55.704]  That's how ignorant and racist and dumb, with stereotypes, the left is.
[00:26:57.918 --> 00:27:00.942]  And so you've got the target, that's your motive, number one.
[00:27:00.942 --> 00:27:02.503]  Then you've got ISIS taking responsibility.
[00:27:02.503 --> 00:27:05.447]  They normally only take responsibility if they've done it.
[00:27:05.447 --> 00:27:07.950]  Even AP admits that.
[00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:13.135]  AP said it's rare for them to take credit for something they haven't done.
[00:27:13.135 --> 00:27:18.562]  And it all builds up and it looks just like him a few months before at an Antifa
[00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:24.713]  Women's March Rally against Trump.
[00:27:24.713 --> 00:27:27.635]  And man, you look at that video from the side, you're not sure.
[00:27:27.635 --> 00:27:32.538]  But when they have a dead-on shot of him, if it's not him, it's his twin brother.
[00:27:32.538 --> 00:27:36.120]  I mean, his brother doesn't look as much like him as this guy does.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.102]  And his brother looks just like him, just younger.
[00:27:38.622 --> 00:27:40.564]  Oh, by the way, the brother said he'd never do this.
[00:27:40.564 --> 00:27:41.605]  He's a great guy.
[00:27:41.605 --> 00:27:42.606]  He's wonderful.
[00:27:42.606 --> 00:27:46.109]  He's worked for, you know, clandestine type groups and stuff.
[00:27:46.109 --> 00:27:47.630]  Lockheed, the Skunk Works.
[00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:48.251]  Oh, yeah.
[00:27:48.251 --> 00:27:49.552]  He's got all this money.
[00:27:49.552 --> 00:27:50.733]  He's traveling all over the world.
[00:27:50.733 --> 00:27:53.816]  It's either organized crime or a spook.
[00:27:56.144 --> 00:28:04.049]  And ladies and gentlemen, now his brother says, oh he did it, he acted alone, it's him, it's him, there's video of his brother, we'll play it when we come back.
[00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:10.733]  Oh, it's him, of course he did it, absolutely, his brother's done a 180 overnight.
[00:28:10.733 --> 00:28:14.735]  It's him, shut it down, no more investigations.
[00:28:14.735 --> 00:28:22.660]  And you've got his brother, the one that's dead, wiring the money all over the place, the Philippines, you name it, this thing stinks to the heavens.
[00:28:23.971 --> 00:28:25.793]  We told you he'd probably be on drugs.
[00:28:25.793 --> 00:28:28.416]  We told you there'd be intelligence agency cutouts.
[00:28:28.416 --> 00:28:32.761]  We told you that look for signs of radicalization.
[00:28:32.761 --> 00:28:36.846]  We told you look for other folks inside the rooms, and that it was really two rooms.
[00:28:36.846 --> 00:28:38.147]  All of it confirmed.

[00:30:38.931 --> 00:30:50.438]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:30:50.438 --> 00:31:00.785]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases,
[00:31:00.845 --> 00:31:10.129]  Infowars had much better nutrition than we do today, and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:31:10.129 --> 00:31:24.134]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[00:31:24.134 --> 00:31:26.495]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:31:26.495 --> 00:31:29.596]  We're getting results, and we're expanding in the face
[00:31:29.616 --> 00:31:30.016]  We're good.
[00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.271]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:47.271 --> 00:31:49.293]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:49.293 --> 00:31:52.195]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:52.195 --> 00:31:58.279]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:58.279 --> 00:32:07.465]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:32:07.465 --> 00:32:10.747]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[00:32:10.987 --> 00:32:14.990]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:23.016]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:32:23.016 --> 00:32:24.097]  The general public doesn't.
[00:32:25.197 --> 00:32:29.138]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:32:29.138 --> 00:32:32.700]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:39.402]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:32:39.402 --> 00:32:49.385]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:49.385 --> 00:32:52.006]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.902]  Now, I want to just tell...
[00:33:25.791 --> 00:33:39.223]  Listeners and viewers something, obviously everybody now recognizes that Infowars broke the fact that the police are looking at radicalization and have found evidence of that in the Vegas massacre.
[00:33:39.223 --> 00:33:53.395]  Also, evidence is emerging of multiple shooters and I've talked to many military experts that are among some of the best in the world and they say clearly you can hear two different types of firearms being used, sometimes simultaneously.
[00:33:54.588 --> 00:34:00.031]  I guess he could be holding two of them at the same time, but this is serious.
[00:34:00.031 --> 00:34:19.981]  We also have all the tell-tale signs of a Patsy working for Lockheed Martin, connected to the Skunk Works, traveling all over the world, millions and millions of dollars that he couldn't show for from shadowy investments, a wife or girlfriend married to two other men, connected to Islamic groups, connected to Antifa groups.
[00:34:19.981 --> 00:34:21.062]  This is all emerging.
[00:34:21.954 --> 00:34:34.245]  And that's why, day one, they have been attacking so incredibly viciously anyone that even dared look at any of these areas.
[00:34:34.245 --> 00:34:37.748]  Then he's a degenerate gambler.
[00:34:37.748 --> 00:34:46.816]  On meds, you look at where this ends up happening in a hardcore Democratic Party company stronghold involved
[00:34:47.947 --> 00:34:55.991]  Giving massive amounts of money to the very suspect groups who had their hands in OKC and other events.
[00:34:55.991 --> 00:34:58.632]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:34:58.632 --> 00:35:11.658]  And then the hostage rescue team is so upset by what they found that they felt like they had to reach out to InfoHorse specifically.
[00:35:11.658 --> 00:35:16.921]  And then they reached back out and said, yes, you said it perfectly, what we relayed to you.
[00:35:16.921 --> 00:35:17.221]  Thank you.
[00:35:18.581 --> 00:35:26.504]  So, I relayed to you what people that pull the triggers for the FBI told us.
[00:35:26.504 --> 00:35:30.126]  Word for word.
[00:35:30.126 --> 00:35:37.769]  From conversations in the morning and text, from other sources, I had double-check it.
[00:35:37.769 --> 00:35:39.329]  Now understand, this is dangerous stuff, folks.
[00:35:39.329 --> 00:35:41.630]  This is real.
[00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.851]  These people are risking their lives.
[00:35:43.851 --> 00:35:45.472]  There's a civil war inside the government.
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.301]  That's why you're seeing this type of information come out.
[00:35:49.301 --> 00:35:54.002]  Now, they're going to hit us with the disinfo that nobody died.
[00:35:54.002 --> 00:35:55.322]  These were all crisis actors.
[00:35:55.322 --> 00:35:57.222]  They'll probably just edit that and say I said it.
[00:35:57.222 --> 00:35:59.543]  I did not say that.
[00:35:59.543 --> 00:36:04.944]  I normally war game things and walk through scenarios, even scenarios I disagree with.
[00:36:04.944 --> 00:36:10.005]  I'm not going to do that here, because they'll edit it and put it on the news and say that I said it didn't happen.
[00:36:10.005 --> 00:36:14.186]  I've been saying since Sunday night before it happened, it was going to happen,
[00:36:15.245 --> 00:36:18.426]  In October, and that they were trying to kick off a civil war.
[00:36:18.426 --> 00:36:27.487]  And then in the morning, because we've been so on top of this, our sources told us that it was full of Antifa literature and traveling to the Middle East.
[00:36:27.487 --> 00:36:31.588]  That came out later in the afternoon, about the traveling to the Middle East.
[00:36:31.588 --> 00:36:38.589]  His live-in, common-law wife.
[00:36:38.589 --> 00:36:40.950]  Filipino wife.
[00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.110]  So, on Friday and on Sunday, I laid it out.
[00:36:44.483 --> 00:36:46.404]  Obviously, InfoWars is a big platform.
[00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:47.945]  Obviously, Drudge is the biggest.
[00:36:47.945 --> 00:36:50.847]  And our sources know our articles tend to get on Drudge.
[00:36:50.847 --> 00:36:53.109]  That's why one reason we're giving the info.
[00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.969]  Where do you see it now?
[00:36:53.969 --> 00:36:57.652]  On Drudge.
[00:36:57.652 --> 00:36:59.253]  So that's how this operates.
[00:36:59.253 --> 00:37:10.320]  And they are really upset on both sides because the folks in the FBI, they're not even sure what really happened here.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.941]  Obviously, they know the guy had massive help.
[00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:21.774]  And then they hear the media immediately saying that A, he killed himself, which isn't true according to them, and B, he had radicalization material.
[00:37:21.774 --> 00:37:31.439]  Now you have the sheriff coming out and saying they're having to look at that, which shows it means they found clues that make them, quote, look to see if he's a radical.
[00:37:31.439 --> 00:37:36.822]  When police spokespersons talk like that, they did that day three of San Bernardino.
[00:37:37.827 --> 00:37:39.928]  They said, we're looking at radicalization.
[00:37:39.928 --> 00:37:42.370]  By the next day, they were Muslims.
[00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:47.953]  By the day after that, we knew about them traveling to Pakistan and to Saudi Arabia, and we knew the whole story.
[00:37:47.953 --> 00:37:50.755]  But remember, the target is the motive.
[00:37:50.755 --> 00:37:58.180]  If a black church gets shot up by a white guy, you can probably bet 99% of the time he's a white supremacist.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:58.941]  Nutbag.
[00:37:58.941 --> 00:37:59.421]  Scumbag.
[00:38:00.808 --> 00:38:10.151]  If a white church gets shot up by a black guy and he turns out to be a Muslim, you can bet he's a radical Muslim and his Facebook said he was and he was going to kill white people a week and a half ago.
[00:38:10.151 --> 00:38:14.892]  This is not rocket science.
[00:38:14.892 --> 00:38:22.614]  Here is the sheriff last night coming out saying they're looking to see if he was radicalized, which means they found material so they now have to look in that direction.
[00:38:22.614 --> 00:38:22.874]  Here it is.
[00:38:24.298 --> 00:38:27.800]  I don't know if we have possible future prosecution.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:34.423]  You know, you heard me say that we're comfortable that we have the suspect in the custody, but something more may come of that investigation.
[00:38:34.423 --> 00:38:40.686]  And I want to understand the motivation that you describe, okay, to prevent any future incidents.
[00:38:40.686 --> 00:38:45.288]  And, you know, did this person get radicalized unbeknownst to us?
[00:38:45.288 --> 00:38:47.009]  And we want to identify that source.
[00:38:47.009 --> 00:38:49.811]  And you see how upset he is?
[00:38:49.811 --> 00:38:52.052]  Because the new information I have
[00:38:58.635 --> 00:38:59.656]  I'm in way over my head.
[00:38:59.656 --> 00:39:03.720]  And by the way, the whole planet's in over its head with the nuclear weapons and all the craziness.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.564]  I mean, I know why the sheriff right there is completely freaked out.
[00:39:08.786 --> 00:39:16.470]  Because to know there's groups this big and the Democratic Party and all of you people involved, there's no end to what they'll do.
[00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:20.272]  I mean, they said they're going to overthrow the president and have a civil war this month.
[00:39:20.272 --> 00:39:22.153]  They said they're going to kill the Republicans.
[00:39:22.153 --> 00:39:25.976]  They've had top Democratic strategists on TV say, hashtag Republicans.
[00:39:25.976 --> 00:39:31.799]  When the guy went and shot Scalise, they had his friend on to say he wasn't a bad guy, he did the right thing because of politics.
[00:39:33.154 --> 00:39:35.155]  And Wilf Blitzer nodded his head.
[00:39:35.155 --> 00:39:37.577]  They're getting ready for war!
[00:39:37.577 --> 00:39:41.419]  And in full spectrum dominance, they're going to carry out the attacks.
[00:39:41.419 --> 00:39:46.363]  And then they're going to turn around and blame us and say our rights and our freedoms are to blame.
[00:39:46.363 --> 00:39:46.903]  Get it?
[00:39:46.903 --> 00:39:48.704]  That's 21st century warfare.
[00:39:48.704 --> 00:39:52.687]  You carry out the attack, and then you blame your enemy who you just killed.
[00:39:56.237 --> 00:39:57.758]  But here's the deal.
[00:39:57.758 --> 00:39:59.759]  Smart people see through it.
[00:39:59.759 --> 00:40:13.288]  So here's Colonel Schaeffer, then I'm going to play the top forensic psychologist, psychiatrist, who by the way is getting all sorts of threats right now, for daring to point out, hey, CNN's at fault here.
[00:40:13.288 --> 00:40:20.252]  CNN's the one radicalizing, calling for violence, saying all white people are racist, and then you got all these white folks that say they got to go out and show they're not bad.
[00:40:23.749 --> 00:40:29.631]  These guys have courage to be doing this because they're coming after everybody that stands up and points out what's really going on.
[00:40:29.631 --> 00:40:32.032]  Here is Colonel Schaefer last night.
[00:40:32.032 --> 00:40:36.013]  I think it's shaping up to be a very deliberate act of terror.
[00:40:36.013 --> 00:40:37.574]  This is beyond dispute.
[00:40:37.574 --> 00:40:39.355]  The question becomes motive.
[00:40:39.355 --> 00:40:41.175]  Everybody seems to be searching for a motive.
[00:40:41.175 --> 00:40:45.097]  Martha, I would argue most of the clues of the motive is right in front of us.
[00:40:45.097 --> 00:40:45.817]  That's right.
[00:40:46.697 --> 00:40:56.242]  This individual parallels in many ways by age and by predisposition of being unstable the shooter who attacked Congressman Scalise back in June.
[00:40:56.242 --> 00:40:56.542]  Bingo.
[00:40:56.542 --> 00:40:59.043]  The Hodgkinson attack.
[00:40:59.043 --> 00:41:00.404]  Very similar age.
[00:41:00.404 --> 00:41:05.606]  They are both considered unstable and so in many ways after talking to both the psychological professionals
[00:41:06.106 --> 00:41:08.987]  There's a lot of parallels there.
[00:41:08.987 --> 00:41:10.347]  Let's look at the target as well.
[00:41:10.347 --> 00:41:12.068]  It was a politically selected target.
[00:41:12.068 --> 00:41:24.092]  I think the target being selected, and let me say this is the perception based on available information, the perception was there's going to be a lot of pro-gun folks there, Trump supporters at this concert.
[00:41:24.092 --> 00:41:34.035]  So therefore, I believe the perception was by the shooter, by the individual who did this by a paddock, that this was a legitimate target
[00:41:34.335 --> 00:41:35.836]  of political expression.
[00:41:35.836 --> 00:41:50.241]  Martha, this may be something people don't like to understand, but the very reason that Hodgkinson did what he did, and I believe Paddock did what he did, is because the left has now encouraged the use of violence as an extension and use of political speech.
[00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:52.422]  And this is what we have to be very careful about.
[00:41:52.422 --> 00:41:53.542]  The slippery slope.
[00:41:53.542 --> 00:41:58.784]  The idea here that somehow violence can become part of someone expressing themselves.
[00:41:58.784 --> 00:42:00.745]  And I think that's the real danger here.
[00:42:00.745 --> 00:42:01.765]  Let me start something else out there.
[00:42:02.145 --> 00:42:08.149]  There was no violence perpetrated by, against Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton during the run-ups to this election.
[00:42:08.149 --> 00:42:12.152]  So this has become a feature of desensitization by the left.
[00:42:12.152 --> 00:42:15.394]  The Kathy Griffith beheading, fake beheading the president.
[00:42:15.394 --> 00:42:23.059]  Things like this, I think, are what's pushing a lot of folks to believe now that somehow violence is an acceptable piece of their, is politically justified.
[00:42:23.942 --> 00:42:26.344]  Schaefer is 100% on target.
[00:42:26.344 --> 00:42:27.925]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[00:42:27.925 --> 00:42:34.971]  Then they play dumb when it happens and say, we're going to take your rights after they've created the climate for this to happen.
[00:42:34.971 --> 00:42:40.575]  This is a planned program and he should run major CIA operations in the field.
[00:42:40.575 --> 00:42:42.657]  And he's telling you point blank what it is.
[00:42:42.657 --> 00:42:43.938]  We've got more straight ahead.
[00:42:45.236 --> 00:42:47.357]  December 23rd, 1776.
[00:42:47.357 --> 00:42:50.679]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[00:42:50.679 --> 00:42:55.701]  The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.
[00:42:55.701 --> 00:43:00.484]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[00:43:00.484 --> 00:43:03.125]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[00:43:03.125 --> 00:43:05.186]  Yet we have this consolation with us.
[00:43:05.186 --> 00:43:08.128]  At the heart of the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[00:43:08.128 --> 00:43:11.170]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:13.811]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[00:43:14.111 --> 00:43:22.833]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods, and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:31.194]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[00:43:31.194 --> 00:43:36.455]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[00:43:36.455 --> 00:43:41.436]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[00:43:42.316 --> 00:43:45.120]  Thomas Paine, the American crisis.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:53.391]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[00:43:53.391 --> 00:43:54.612]  A 360 win.
[00:43:54.612 --> 00:43:58.117]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off.
[00:43:59.258 --> 00:44:01.179]  On your order at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:44:01.179 --> 00:44:09.102]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:44:09.102 --> 00:44:14.184]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:44:14.184 --> 00:44:20.287]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:44:20.287 --> 00:44:23.768]  Just go to InfoWareStore.com, select your favorite product or products,
[00:44:23.888 --> 00:44:28.072]  Click on AutoShip and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:44:28.072 --> 00:44:30.434]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win.
[00:44:30.434 --> 00:44:35.278]  And with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:44:35.278 --> 00:44:36.239]  10% off on AutoShip.
[00:44:36.239 --> 00:44:38.681]  Win, win, win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:44:38.681 --> 00:44:40.663]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[00:44:40.663 --> 00:44:44.527]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:44:45.822 --> 00:44:54.912]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:44:54.912 --> 00:45:03.341]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:45:03.341 --> 00:45:07.986]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:14.967]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:45:14.967 --> 00:45:22.148]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:45:22.148 --> 00:45:29.170]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:33.650]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:36.871]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:42.254]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:45:42.254 --> 00:45:46.075]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but
[00:46:01.523 --> 00:46:09.128]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:46:09.128 --> 00:46:15.493]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:46:15.493 --> 00:46:16.793]  These are all parasites.
[00:46:16.793 --> 00:46:17.914]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:46:17.914 --> 00:46:18.955]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:46:19.235 --> 00:46:23.737]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:46:23.737 --> 00:46:27.019]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:46:27.019 --> 00:46:30.081]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:46:30.081 --> 00:46:31.121]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:33.062]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:33.062 --> 00:46:34.083]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:46:34.083 --> 00:46:36.784]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:46:36.784 --> 00:46:38.705]  And you support the broadcast.
[00:46:38.705 --> 00:46:40.046]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:40.046 --> 00:46:42.287]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:46:42.287 --> 00:46:44.248]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:46:49.304 --> 00:46:51.908]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:11.087]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:47:11.087 --> 00:47:12.568]  to 3 p.m., we're live.
[00:47:12.568 --> 00:47:16.010]  A lot of other great stations were here on the broadcast.
[00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:20.414]  You know, the media acts like Infowars is dangerous and that that's a bad thing.
[00:47:20.414 --> 00:47:21.535]  But who are we dangerous to?
[00:47:21.535 --> 00:47:24.257]  We're dangerous to the globalists.
[00:47:24.257 --> 00:47:29.641]  And I hope the listeners and viewers don't take for granted the affiliates that bravely carry this broadcast.
[00:47:29.641 --> 00:47:33.044]  I hope you don't take for granted the great crew we've got, because
[00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:38.211]  Impo Wars is a precious asset in the fight for freedom.
[00:47:38.211 --> 00:47:40.911]  And I want to thank you all for your support and your prayers.
[00:47:40.911 --> 00:47:43.572]  And know this, I don't take you for granted.
[00:47:43.572 --> 00:47:57.195]  It's very, very humbling to be at your service because being in service for you is a service to myself and my family and trying to beat the absolutely kleptocratic, psychopathic globalists that are so ruthless.
[00:48:01.892 --> 00:48:17.780]  If you just joined us, Colonel Schaeffer went on Fox News last night and said from his sources in the government, this is a leftist Democratic Party operation with mainstream media, corporate media hyping the climate of kill the Republicans, kill the white people.
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:22.062]  And Michelle Obama came out and said that the government's bad because there's white people.
[00:48:23.072 --> 00:48:24.293]  And there's men.
[00:48:24.293 --> 00:48:26.214]  That's a quote that's coming up.
[00:48:26.214 --> 00:48:34.100]  You see Trudeau saying, after another Islamic attack Sunday, he said, white supremacism is the problem, we apologize for it.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:39.964]  So when a black guy kills white people or runs them over, you just say that as cognitive dissonance.
[00:48:39.964 --> 00:48:42.646]  And you keep pushing.
[00:48:42.646 --> 00:48:46.429]  And then when your target gets shot up and 500 people get shot and 59 get killed,
[00:48:48.322 --> 00:48:50.823]  You turn around and say, see white people?
[00:48:50.823 --> 00:48:51.804]  Turn your gun in.
[00:48:51.804 --> 00:49:00.087]  Oh, and when people don't take their vaccines, you have the head of the Texas vaccine program out of Baylor say, we've got to get rid of the white people.
[00:49:00.087 --> 00:49:01.168]  Let's kill them.
[00:49:01.168 --> 00:49:06.130]  See, this all sounds insane, but they all said that.
[00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:10.112]  The deputy head of CBS said, these are a bunch of white Republicans.
[00:49:10.112 --> 00:49:10.832]  They deserve it.
[00:49:10.832 --> 00:49:11.733]  She's a white woman.
[00:49:12.998 --> 00:49:18.379]  They've gotten so radicalized with their own propaganda that they're believing all this stuff.
[00:49:18.379 --> 00:49:26.661]  And then when their folks go out and kill, they cover it up and they blame it on the victims.
[00:49:26.661 --> 00:49:27.982]  And you see Democrats all over the place.
[00:49:27.982 --> 00:49:32.823]  I've got a stack of news of Democrats celebrating the dead simultaneously.
[00:49:32.823 --> 00:49:33.803]  Oh, we love them so much.
[00:49:33.803 --> 00:49:34.683]  Oh, but they deserve it.
[00:49:34.683 --> 00:49:38.544]  They're a bunch of Republican right-wing scum that like country music, fly over country.
[00:49:38.544 --> 00:49:40.344]  Oh, but remember them and turn your guns in.
[00:49:40.344 --> 00:49:42.285]  But you're the ones that want guns, so you deserve it.
[00:49:43.305 --> 00:49:46.831]  That's what they're saying.
[00:49:46.831 --> 00:49:50.097]  And they think you're stupid.
[00:49:50.097 --> 00:49:52.121]  But the truth is, you've broken with them.
[00:49:53.086 --> 00:49:54.908]  You're awake to what they're doing.
[00:49:54.908 --> 00:50:00.813]  And so, they now have weaponized all the media, and the NFL, and the late night shows, and that's not working either.
[00:50:00.813 --> 00:50:08.780]  So now they've gotta wind up one of their toys, to go out and shoot hundreds of people, to try to then project it on us and say, SEE?
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.142]  We should be running things!
[00:50:10.142 --> 00:50:13.104]  We know you did it, scum!
[00:50:13.104 --> 00:50:16.628]  Bare minimum, by hyping the whole thing, you're to blame!
[00:50:20.103 --> 00:50:21.984]  And Colonel Schaffer says you're to blame.
[00:50:21.984 --> 00:50:27.747]  And the top psychiatrist that works for the federal government's come out and says you're to blame.
[00:50:27.747 --> 00:50:30.368]  And other experts are coming out and saying you're to blame.
[00:50:30.368 --> 00:50:42.214]  And clearly look at the target, look at the guy, and it's all going to come out him there wearing his little pink hat and being part of the Women's March group and Sorcerer and all of it's coming out.
[00:50:42.214 --> 00:50:47.557]  We know just exactly what went on now, don't we?
[00:50:47.557 --> 00:50:49.498]  We now have it all figured out, don't we?
[00:50:50.649 --> 00:50:54.451]  And so you better try as hard as you can to keep it covered up.
[00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:56.192]  Just like Hillary hacking the election.
[00:50:56.192 --> 00:50:59.394]  She stole five states, tried to steal six others, got caught.
[00:50:59.394 --> 00:51:01.935]  Had five plus million illegals vote, not three million.
[00:51:01.935 --> 00:51:03.636]  Like Trump said, it's all come out.
[00:51:03.636 --> 00:51:05.497]  Harvard studies.
[00:51:05.497 --> 00:51:08.159]  They turn it around and say the Russians tried to hack it.
[00:51:09.718 --> 00:51:12.960]  Well of course every foreign government out there tries to influence our elections.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.920]  We do theirs too.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:24.687]  But they weren't anything compared to all of Hollywood and all the big media and all the big telecoms and Google and Facebook and the big internet companies and the big universities and all the money.
[00:51:25.447 --> 00:51:34.475]  And all the newspapers, and the foreign governments, and the Saudi Arabians, and the EU, and the Vatican, all saying, you can't make America great again!
[00:51:34.475 --> 00:51:35.916]  You'll never rebuild!
[00:51:35.916 --> 00:51:38.619]  You'll never have 3% growth rate again!
[00:51:38.619 --> 00:51:40.040]  We're gonna get your guns!
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.401]  We're gonna ban your speech!
[00:51:41.401 --> 00:51:42.822]  Your kids belong to us!
[00:51:42.822 --> 00:51:43.663]  Remember?
[00:51:43.663 --> 00:51:44.063]  MSNBC?
[00:51:44.784 --> 00:51:45.644]  Well, guess what?
[00:51:45.644 --> 00:51:49.106]  It ain't as easy as you thought it'd be, dirtbags!
[00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:52.007]  And now you're telling everybody you're gonna start killing people!
[00:51:52.007 --> 00:51:56.729]  And you got CIA deputy directors on TV saying, we're gonna kill the President!
[00:51:56.729 --> 00:51:58.110]  As a threat to the President!
[00:51:58.110 --> 00:51:59.871]  As if he doesn't know what you're doing!
[00:51:59.871 --> 00:52:01.711]  As if you think he's gonna roll over!
[00:52:01.711 --> 00:52:03.152]  He's not rolling over!
[00:52:03.152 --> 00:52:04.373]  I'm not rolling over!
[00:52:04.373 --> 00:52:10.155]  And all you've done is summon the whirlwind, scum!
[00:52:10.155 --> 00:52:14.037]  That's all you've done is wake up America!
[00:52:16.067 --> 00:52:18.029]  Good luck now.
[00:52:18.029 --> 00:52:21.032]  Grindle thought he was coming to eat Beowulf.
[00:52:21.032 --> 00:52:27.478]  But Grindle went home with his mommy with his right arm torn out of the socket bleeding to death politically.
[00:52:27.478 --> 00:52:29.019]  You think you're hunting us?
[00:52:29.019 --> 00:52:29.880]  Get ready.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.842]  We're gonna destroy you politically.
[00:52:31.842 --> 00:52:32.963]  And we're gonna hold our fire.
[00:52:34.039 --> 00:52:36.401]  But you watch, they're going to false flag even bigger now.
[00:52:36.401 --> 00:52:39.824]  They're going for total broke to break your will.
[00:52:39.824 --> 00:52:45.208]  And if they do that, then they're going to put 50 million people in forced labor camps.
[00:52:45.208 --> 00:52:46.749]  That's mainstream news.
[00:52:46.749 --> 00:52:52.154]  And they can't wait to give every one of these little communists time with your wife and kids in some dungeon.
[00:52:52.154 --> 00:52:53.875]  Because that's what they want.
[00:52:53.875 --> 00:52:54.616]  I'm not kidding.
[00:52:54.616 --> 00:52:55.797]  They're coming.
[00:52:55.797 --> 00:52:57.738]  You wanted to see the fight for America?
[00:52:57.738 --> 00:52:58.519]  You're living it!
[00:52:58.519 --> 00:52:58.779]  2017, baby!
[00:53:01.294 --> 00:53:02.314]  This is it.
[00:53:02.314 --> 00:53:04.195]  Toe-to-toe combat with the globalists.
[00:53:04.195 --> 00:53:07.216]  Politically.
[00:53:07.216 --> 00:53:11.897]  At every front they launch about Puerto Rico or you name it, Trump is there to block them.
[00:53:11.897 --> 00:53:14.398]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[00:53:14.398 --> 00:53:21.700]  Forensic psychiatrists suggest gunmen may have deliberately targeted conservatives so CNN actually contributed to the mass shooting.
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:29.082]  Hell, I've seen CNN having guests on that were friends with the Scalise shooter saying he was not a bad guy and was a good guy.
[00:53:29.082 --> 00:53:30.442]  They celebrated it!
[00:53:31.937 --> 00:53:34.639]  You can pull the article up!
[00:53:34.639 --> 00:53:46.066]  As the motive behind Sunday night's massacre in Las Vegas remains unclear, forensic psychiatrist Dr. Michael Wellner suggested the gunman, Steven Paddock, may have deliberately targeted conservatives and that CNN was partly to blame.
[00:53:46.066 --> 00:53:46.926]  Well, it's beyond that.
[00:53:46.926 --> 00:53:49.067]  Paul Watson's being safe here.
[00:53:49.067 --> 00:53:53.130]  He walks through the motive, the history, here it is, this is powerful, this is important.
[00:53:54.033 --> 00:54:04.978]  Five minutes now after the hour, investigators now trying to figure out why a gunman opened fire with 23 firearms in his hotel and 19 back at his house, killing at least 59 people and injuring hundreds more.
[00:54:04.978 --> 00:54:09.501]  According to his brother, there was no clues he would commit such a horrific attack.
[00:54:09.501 --> 00:54:11.382]  There were clues?
[00:54:11.382 --> 00:54:14.343]  A religious affiliation.
[00:54:14.343 --> 00:54:16.644]  Now his brother says he totally did it, 100%.
[00:54:16.644 --> 00:54:21.607]  A 180, now that somebody's talked to him, because we need to shut this down now.
[00:54:23.083 --> 00:54:25.125]  180 in just two days.
[00:54:25.125 --> 00:54:27.489]  But again, no, there was affiliations, we know.
[00:54:27.489 --> 00:54:30.192]  Antifa and other material inside.
[00:54:30.192 --> 00:54:31.134]  Continue.
[00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:32.155]  You should know, he just...
[00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:36.611]  Hungover, shocked, horrified.
[00:54:36.611 --> 00:54:37.211]  Hit pause.
[00:54:37.211 --> 00:54:37.992]  Complete.
[00:54:37.992 --> 00:54:42.955]  I wanted to be nice on Monday, but even the crew said this guy looks like he's completely full of BS.
[00:54:42.955 --> 00:54:49.219]  I mean, if your child, you caught him with cookie stuff all over their face and a cookie in their hand, they said, oh, I wasn't eating the cookies, Dad.
[00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:55.564]  I mean, this guy, and he's totally 180, but I was nice on Monday and didn't say this guy sounded like he was full of baloney.
[00:54:55.564 --> 00:54:57.265]  But back it up five seconds.
[00:54:57.265 --> 00:54:58.406]  Let's finish up with this guy.
[00:54:58.406 --> 00:55:01.308]  Here is the reported shooter's brother, Eric Paddock.
[00:55:01.308 --> 00:55:01.628]  Here it is.
[00:55:03.146 --> 00:55:10.731]  Hungover, shocked, horrified, completely dumbfounded about this.
[00:55:10.731 --> 00:55:16.355]  So what goes on in the mind of a shooter like this as they shoot at innocent people?
[00:55:16.355 --> 00:55:18.737]  Here now to discuss this is Dr. Michael Wellner.
[00:55:18.737 --> 00:55:24.041]  He's a top forensic psychiatrist who has personally examined a number of mass killers.
[00:55:24.041 --> 00:55:25.241]  Doctor, thank you for being with us.
[00:55:25.241 --> 00:55:26.042]  Good morning.
[00:55:26.042 --> 00:55:26.602]  What happened?
[00:55:26.602 --> 00:55:27.283]  What's going on here?
[00:55:27.523 --> 00:55:33.005]  Well, if you want to understand the killer, the most important place to start is with the victims.
[00:55:33.005 --> 00:55:38.366]  And what we can immediately see is that he had no relationship to the killers.
[00:55:38.366 --> 00:55:41.787]  A workplace mass shooter knows his victims.
[00:55:41.787 --> 00:55:43.008]  And they want to see the victim, right?
[00:55:43.008 --> 00:55:45.429]  And they want to destroy, annihilate the workplace.
[00:55:45.429 --> 00:55:46.469]  That's another key point.
[00:55:47.029 --> 00:55:50.230]  The family mass shooter knows the family, wants to annihilate the family.
[00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:53.651]  The criminal enterprise wants to kill the gang.
[00:55:53.651 --> 00:55:55.911]  So it's a stranger mass homicide.
[00:55:55.911 --> 00:55:59.172]  And a stranger mass homicide happens for one of two reasons.
[00:55:59.172 --> 00:56:08.175]  Either a person acting for a cause, or a person acting because he wants to transcend notoriety and kill as many people as possible, like a James Holmes.
[00:56:08.175 --> 00:56:11.596]  However... James Holmes, who was the Aurora shooter?
[00:56:11.596 --> 00:56:12.816]  And you worked on that case?
[00:56:12.816 --> 00:56:12.996]  Yes.
[00:56:14.147 --> 00:56:15.928]  Here's the thing.
[00:56:15.928 --> 00:56:21.132]  Shooting for notoriety's sake, and nothing more, is a young man's crime.
[00:56:21.132 --> 00:56:27.696]  And this is a 64-year-old with no dramatic mental illness, no major decline, someone who's intact.
[00:56:27.696 --> 00:56:38.984]  I think if we want to understand what's behind the crime, we should look at James Hodgkinson, the shooter of Congressman Scalise, because that crime itself was intended to be a spectacle
[00:56:39.224 --> 00:56:39.444]  Okay.
[00:57:02.452 --> 00:57:04.093]  Who would have been mowed down?
[00:57:04.093 --> 00:57:12.976]  My point is, a spectacle is either designed to cause some derivative impact, or to instigate some cause discussion.
[00:57:12.976 --> 00:57:19.199]  That's right, a special election, and even mainstream news now admits this appears to be a destabilization campaign of the U.S.
[00:57:19.199 --> 00:57:20.659]  to bring in martial law.
[00:57:20.659 --> 00:57:23.580]  Folks, we must face the attack we're under if we're going to beat it.
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:27.262]  Yes, it's radical to say that, because reality's radical.
[00:57:27.262 --> 00:57:28.322]  This is happening.
[00:57:28.322 --> 00:57:29.863]  This is the battle for America.

[00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:41.432]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:47.421 --> 00:59:54.283]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:54.283 --> 00:59:56.463]  The war was lost.
[00:59:56.463 --> 00:59:58.784]  The treaty signed.
[00:59:58.784 --> 01:00:00.984]  I was not cut.
[01:00:00.984 --> 01:00:03.245]  I crossed the line.
[01:00:03.245 --> 01:00:04.865]  I was not cut.
[01:00:04.865 --> 01:00:09.647]  Well, President Trump is breaking the globalist treaty with the megabanks and pulling the U.S.
[01:00:09.647 --> 01:00:10.687]  out of this globalist system.
[01:00:12.583 --> 01:00:14.425]  That's why all hell's breaking loose.
[01:00:14.425 --> 01:00:15.846]  There's DrudgeReport.com.
[01:00:15.846 --> 01:00:20.351]  Two of those top links are Infowars.com reports by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:22.673]  Sheriff, did Shooter get radicalized?
[01:00:22.673 --> 01:00:31.702]  And then what he says is we're now having to look at that, which means they have materials showing that they have to investigate that, and that's what the hostage rescue team sources that I can tell you are...
[01:00:32.683 --> 01:00:35.065]  Directly with the hostage rescue team.
[01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:36.806]  I know, I can't believe we have sources that good.
[01:00:36.806 --> 01:00:38.147]  We do.
[01:00:38.147 --> 01:00:40.049]  Because we're crazy enough to tell you the truth here.
[01:00:40.049 --> 01:00:41.149]  Other folks are scared.
[01:00:41.149 --> 01:00:43.471]  I'm not bragging, because I'm in this to win.
[01:00:43.471 --> 01:00:48.175]  I just want people to understand, this is like getting shot out of a cannon, or evil Knievel stuff at this point.
[01:00:48.175 --> 01:00:49.055]  Okay?
[01:00:49.055 --> 01:00:52.278]  And I'm not jumping over buses here to act tough or get money.
[01:00:52.278 --> 01:00:55.000]  I'm doing this because you get into this fight slow,
[01:00:56.337 --> 01:01:02.428]  And before you know it, you'll give anything to win because you know that the globalists are pure evil.
[01:01:02.428 --> 01:01:08.139]  But listeners need to know, I mean, the stuff going on right now is fantastical.
[01:01:08.139 --> 01:01:08.359]  Okay?
[01:01:10.045 --> 01:01:17.708]  The Democrats have openly called for a civil war in October-November, openly told their people to go out and kill Congress, kill white people, kill, kill, kill.
[01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:20.950]  Michelle Obama piled on and said this is all happening because white people are bad.
[01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:22.730]  That clip's coming up.
[01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:25.472]  I mean, we've reached next level cuckoo land.
[01:01:25.472 --> 01:01:27.252]  In fact, let's play her in a second.
[01:01:27.252 --> 01:01:30.914]  But right now, here's the sheriff saying we're having to look at radicalization.
[01:01:31.977 --> 01:01:35.398]  And if other arrests are going to have to be made because of the materiel.
[01:01:35.398 --> 01:01:37.799]  And that's what was in the hotel room, folks.
[01:01:37.799 --> 01:01:40.720]  He's attacking a country music deal of Trump supporters.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:44.701]  Democrats everywhere celebrated Sunday and Monday.
[01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:49.663]  Then they turn around and say, oh, well, you deserve to get killed because you own guns, but turn all your guns in now.
[01:01:49.663 --> 01:01:54.564]  They can't even discipline themselves enough to actually act like they care about the victims.
[01:01:54.564 --> 01:01:59.166]  They're as happy as a pig in mud.
[01:01:59.166 --> 01:02:00.226]  Or as a fly on
[01:02:06.116 --> 01:02:11.320]  I don't know if we have possible future prosecution.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:17.946]  You know, you heard me say that we're comfortable that we have the suspect in the custody, but something more may come of that investigation.
[01:02:17.946 --> 01:02:24.211]  And I want to understand the motivation that you describe, okay, to prevent any future incidents.
[01:02:24.211 --> 01:02:28.815]  And, you know, did this person get radicalized unbeknownst to us?
[01:02:28.815 --> 01:02:30.296]  And we want to identify that source.
[01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:37.591]  I have a stack of news here, where the white people are evil.
[01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:45.035]  And it's mainly, usually out of white folks' mouth, because they want to prove how good they are, and how hateful they are, and how sick they are, and how historically ignorant they are.
[01:02:45.035 --> 01:02:50.058]  Deli owner glad a white man shot white people, not terror, but community outrage.
[01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:51.418]  This is out of Twitter.
[01:02:51.418 --> 01:02:53.940]  And of course, there's just thousands of these.
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.341]  So as I heard it was a country music, I felt relief.
[01:02:56.341 --> 01:03:00.283]  White people shooting white people isn't terror, it's community outrage.
[01:03:00.283 --> 01:03:04.165]  Really, white people are the second rarest group
[01:03:05.441 --> 01:03:08.302]  To shoot folks in the United States according to FBI statistics.
[01:03:08.302 --> 01:03:14.524]  You know the number one rarest group, they're also the richest people, on average, Asians.
[01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:21.806]  It's like white folks are like number 9 or number 10 depending on the year of richest or average middle class and wealth being the highest.
[01:03:21.806 --> 01:03:27.528]  It's just like test scores, it's the Asians up there on the stereotype.
[01:03:27.528 --> 01:03:30.129]  Well behaved, hard working, smart, judicious.
[01:03:31.417 --> 01:03:32.879]  Eat your lunch.
[01:03:32.879 --> 01:03:35.682]  And they're not shooting each other unless it's a few gangs.
[01:03:35.682 --> 01:03:40.648]  You know, occasionally that's usually done very quietly in some warehouse where they chop you up.
[01:03:40.648 --> 01:03:42.951]  And you're fed to the fishes.
[01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:51.374]  But, again, just more bull... Oh, you white people are... You know, I saw that Spaghetti Western where Clint Eastwood was shooting a bunch of people.
[01:03:51.374 --> 01:03:52.755]  Yeah, that's the white people!
[01:03:52.755 --> 01:03:57.277]  They're all out there riding their horses to the country music thing and all shooting each other.
[01:03:57.277 --> 01:03:58.838]  It's the opposite.
[01:03:58.838 --> 01:04:00.880]  You don't have folks stealing people's wallets.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.321]  You don't have people getting into fights hardly.
[01:04:03.321 --> 01:04:08.344]  But, again... We're told white people are inherently evil.
[01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:09.365]  That's the attitude.
[01:04:09.365 --> 01:04:12.086]  And then I've got Michelle Obama.
[01:04:12.086 --> 01:04:13.167]  Michelle Obama right here.
[01:04:15.196 --> 01:04:16.236]  We'll get to this coming up.
[01:04:16.236 --> 01:04:19.317]  We have a surprise guest on the other side of this break.
[01:04:19.317 --> 01:04:21.137]  Oh, acid attacks are way up in Europe.
[01:04:21.137 --> 01:04:22.597]  They're calling for a ban on acid.
[01:04:22.597 --> 01:04:24.458]  They're trying to ban guns.
[01:04:24.458 --> 01:04:25.038]  That's coming up.
[01:04:25.038 --> 01:04:28.199]  Guys, I had my Michelle Obama clip in here, but I can't find it.
[01:04:28.199 --> 01:04:29.539]  Will you guys give me the article about her?
[01:04:29.539 --> 01:04:30.919]  Oh, there it is.
[01:04:30.919 --> 01:04:32.219]  It's Michelle Obama.
[01:04:32.219 --> 01:04:36.420]  People don't trust politics because it's all white, all white, all men.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:40.801]  I mean, what a racist curmudgeon.
[01:04:44.608 --> 01:04:49.871]  Protect your skin with SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion by Emrix Essentials.

[01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:03.343]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.677 --> 01:06:29.020]  Okay, we got a call about 15 minutes ago from Ted Nugent saying he wanted to pop in at about five after, six after this hour.
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:31.481]  So we're waiting for his call.
[01:06:31.481 --> 01:06:33.922]  He wants to say some things about the situation.
[01:06:33.922 --> 01:06:36.184]  I've told him anytime he wants to come on, he's welcome.
[01:06:36.184 --> 01:06:40.346]  So I really wanted to get him on about the whole NFL thing and so many other big issues.
[01:06:40.346 --> 01:06:42.507]  The Puerto Rico lie, but obviously he's going to want to talk about
[01:06:43.287 --> 01:06:49.509]  This tragic event, 59 people dead, 500 plus wounded, and the whole official story has disintegrated.
[01:06:49.509 --> 01:06:53.131]  The sheriff has come out and said we're having to look at radicalization.
[01:06:53.131 --> 01:06:56.832]  We're following leads on that because there's some evidence to that.
[01:06:56.832 --> 01:06:59.133]  I mean, when they say we're having to look at radicalization right now,
[01:07:00.356 --> 01:07:05.017]  That's what they did day three of San Bernardino, as they said, we're looking into radicalization.
[01:07:05.017 --> 01:07:18.941]  Sure, they both had Middle Eastern names, but okay, they've been going to the Middle East, and okay, they were wearing full body armor and screaming Allah Akbar, and turns out that the FPAD had known about it for two years, but was ordered to stand down by Obama.
[01:07:18.941 --> 01:07:26.143]  So they have this history, the Pulse nightclub, Major Hassan at Fort Hood, almost four years after that happened, they admitted it was a terror attack.
[01:07:26.143 --> 01:07:27.924]  He worked for Al-Qaeda!
[01:07:27.924 --> 01:07:29.464]  He pledged allegiance to them!
[01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:56.292]  So it is simply mind-boggling and amazing to sit there and to understand that they have a history of covering up Islamic attacks or radical leftist attacks while the leftists are all over the news saying, go out and kill white people, go out and kill Trump supporters, go out and kill Trump.
[01:07:56.292 --> 01:07:57.213]  It's just everywhere.
[01:07:57.213 --> 01:07:58.094]  It's ubiquitous.
[01:07:58.094 --> 01:07:59.535]  It's like sunshine.
[01:08:01.004 --> 01:08:02.406]  Or oxygen.
[01:08:02.406 --> 01:08:12.457]  It's an ocean of threats and violence and hatred, where if I walk down the streets in so-called liberal cities, they come screaming Nazi, pouring hot coffee on me.
[01:08:12.457 --> 01:08:13.679]  And gibbering obscenities.
[01:08:15.677 --> 01:08:25.741]  And it's a bunch of white folks trying to prove to other white folks that they really hate white people and they're not with the white folks because they're so uncomfortable, I guess, racist around people that aren't white.
[01:08:25.741 --> 01:08:35.044]  They've got a virtue signal to them that they're like them, that they're their friends, until it makes everybody totally uncomfortable and they turn into complete mental patients.
[01:08:36.926 --> 01:08:38.466]  So they got a big problem.
[01:08:38.466 --> 01:08:41.487]  They're the ones who are used to control the narrative in the media.
[01:08:41.487 --> 01:08:42.828]  They don't anymore.
[01:08:42.828 --> 01:08:43.988]  They're totally distrusted.
[01:08:43.988 --> 01:08:45.408]  They're totally disdained.
[01:08:45.408 --> 01:08:47.729]  They're calling for all this violence.
[01:08:47.729 --> 01:08:51.290]  Then a guy targets a mainly white country music venue.
[01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:58.832]  The Democrats celebrate high-level officials at CBS News, Democrat strategists, Twitter, saying they deserve it.
[01:08:58.832 --> 01:09:01.193]  They're white, they're conservative, they're Trump supporters.
[01:09:01.193 --> 01:09:01.553]  Good!
[01:09:02.924 --> 01:09:06.606]  And simultaneously, oh look, they're victims, turn your guns in.
[01:09:06.606 --> 01:09:10.929]  While simultaneously saying, well, but they are gun owners, a lot of them, so they deserve it.
[01:09:10.929 --> 01:09:12.550]  Maybe you'll grow up now.
[01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:14.191]  Talk about perching on victims.
[01:09:14.191 --> 01:09:15.832]  Talk about using a crisis.
[01:09:15.832 --> 01:09:18.033]  Talk about being insensitive and evil.
[01:09:19.226 --> 01:09:21.407]  But they're the ones that have been radicalizing.
[01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:23.288]  They're the ones that have been pushing it.
[01:09:23.288 --> 01:09:35.452]  They're the ones that have been hammering this over and over and over and over, trying to get a civil war going they said would start in October or in November.
[01:09:35.452 --> 01:09:42.215]  So here are the headlines on DrudgeReport.com, NewsWars.com and Infowars.com right now.
[01:09:42.215 --> 01:09:43.535]  Breaking!
[01:09:43.535 --> 01:09:46.977]  Sheriff Las Vegas shooter could have been radicalized.
[01:09:47.947 --> 01:09:50.609]  They're looking into evidence of that right now.
[01:09:50.609 --> 01:10:04.457]  Forensic psychiatrist says Gunman may have been deliberately targeting conservatives, and then walks through how much it's like the Scalise attack, and meant to overthrow the government, meant to have special elections.
[01:10:04.457 --> 01:10:15.624]  Colonel Schaefer, Gunman deliberately targeted country music concert to kill Trump supporters, and again how CNN, MSNBC, and others are creating a radicalized, conditioned climate to do so.
[01:10:16.829 --> 01:10:22.011]  Receipt shows Paddock had another guest in his room before shooting.
[01:10:22.011 --> 01:10:24.992]  Our sources have now confirmed that it is a real receipt.
[01:10:24.992 --> 01:10:30.895]  It is from folks inside the hotel and indeed he did check in at least a day before they claimed he had.
[01:10:30.895 --> 01:10:33.056]  Five days he was there and didn't get caught.
[01:10:33.056 --> 01:10:33.516]  Give me a break.
[01:10:34.136 --> 01:10:40.278]  Again, most mass shootings link to SSRIs and other drugs, but MSM ignores that.
[01:10:40.278 --> 01:10:43.699]  That's from us on Monday, Kit Daniels.
[01:10:43.699 --> 01:10:56.402]  Now, today we learned he was on medication for mental problems, and it says on the insert, it can cause you to have psychotic breaks and go out and kill people.
[01:10:57.202 --> 01:11:01.608]  Again, we said look for radicalization that the HRT had given us the info.
[01:11:01.608 --> 01:11:05.572]  Last night the sheriff confirms they have found evidence of that.
[01:11:05.572 --> 01:11:10.038]  That's when the sheriff comes out and says we now are looking at radicalization.
[01:11:10.038 --> 01:11:12.221]  They did that day three of San Bernardino as well.
[01:11:12.221 --> 01:11:15.565]  The next day we learned they were jihadis and that Obama had ordered a cover-up.
[01:11:15.885 --> 01:11:17.728]  But the cover-up didn't last.
[01:11:17.728 --> 01:11:18.629]  Look at the target.
[01:11:18.629 --> 01:11:19.651]  Look at the venue.
[01:11:19.651 --> 01:11:20.452]  That's the motive.
[01:11:20.452 --> 01:11:22.195]  That's what Colonel Schaefer has said.
[01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:24.519]  That's what top government psychiatrists have said.
[01:11:24.519 --> 01:11:26.702]  That's what all the evidence shows.
[01:11:26.702 --> 01:11:27.924]  It's right in front of you.
[01:11:29.738 --> 01:11:38.181]  Joining us is the Motor City Madman himself, the Omnibusman of the Second Amendment, and that of course is Ted Nugent of tednugent.com.
[01:11:38.181 --> 01:11:44.904]  I wish I could have you here on Better Times, but thank you for joining us to give your knowledge and your important input into what we're facing.
[01:11:44.904 --> 01:11:50.126]  But undoubtedly, Ted, we are seeing a full-out war declared on the Second Amendment.
[01:11:50.126 --> 01:11:51.847]  They're going for broke, Ted.
[01:11:53.007 --> 01:11:53.968]  Yeah, it's true, Alex.
[01:11:53.968 --> 01:11:55.169]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:11:55.169 --> 01:11:55.649]  I agree.
[01:11:55.649 --> 01:12:00.453]  I wish it could be under more pleasant circumstances because it is a wonderful time of year.
[01:12:00.453 --> 01:12:05.077]  I'm spending time with great families around the hunting campfires here in the swamps of Michigan.
[01:12:05.077 --> 01:12:09.761]  I just got back from Okinawa, spending a week with the incredible U.S.
[01:12:09.761 --> 01:12:11.502]  Marine Corps warriors.
[01:12:11.502 --> 01:12:14.985]  So my spirit is on high right now, but it's also shattered.
[01:12:15.678 --> 01:12:22.199]  Because of this tragic, demonic, violent assault and massacre in Las Vegas.
[01:12:22.199 --> 01:12:29.921]  So I'm sure you have expressed that good people are looking at all the unlimited good that overwhelmed the bad and ugly and evil.
[01:12:29.921 --> 01:12:33.982]  That is American citizens and first responders and the cops and the military.
[01:12:33.982 --> 01:12:40.303]  But just you and me, working hard, playing hard, regular old citizen Americans,
[01:12:40.783 --> 01:12:55.649]  Who became warriors and really saved lives and mitigated what could have been much, much worse because of the lessons we learned from Columbine and the heroes of law enforcement, first responders, even the trained security at the Mandalay Bay there.
[01:12:55.649 --> 01:13:02.072]  They went up there immediately to confront, not regroup, not organize, not spend time and try to determine what's going on.
[01:13:02.072 --> 01:13:03.653]  They saw what was going on.
[01:13:03.653 --> 01:13:08.315]  They interdicted the conditions and they saved many, many lives.
[01:13:08.895 --> 01:13:14.096]  Yes, there is an assault on the Second Amendment, but I gotta tell ya, Alex, I'm not out here alone.
[01:13:14.096 --> 01:13:17.977]  Not just the great men and women of the National Rifle Association, but good people.
[01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:36.341]  I'm watching Tucker Carlson and Greg Gutfeld and Newt Gingrich and a crime specialist from Australia completely destroying the lies and the fantasy of those that believe another gun law could have stopped this or any of the other mass shootings or any crime.
[01:13:36.821 --> 01:13:59.814]  I mean, if you can't keep real Kalashnikov machine guns out of people's hands in Paris, France, then obviously people with any intellect and common sense whatsoever will realize that there's nothing you can write on paper and turn into a law or a regulation that would have stopped any
[01:14:00.643 --> 01:14:04.806]  of the mass shootings because evil is as evil does.
[01:14:04.806 --> 01:14:22.060]  But we, the citizens of America, will not let our Second Amendment rights, our God-given, constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms, we will not let it be infringed any further and we're making a stand right here and right now.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.602]  We're going to break here to some moments, so please stay with us.
[01:14:25.602 --> 01:14:30.324]  Again, Ted Nugent's our guest, but just briefly, have you seen the information coming out?
[01:14:30.324 --> 01:14:31.565]  They're looking at radicalization.
[01:14:31.565 --> 01:14:43.312]  Our FBI sources told us Monday, and it's now being confirmed, that there was Antifa and pro-Islamic garbage in there, and his live-in, I guess, common-law wife was traveling to Dubai and other areas.
[01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:46.613]  He was wiring money all over to Islamic countries.
[01:14:46.613 --> 01:14:47.374]  This looks really bad.
[01:14:48.365 --> 01:14:50.686]  Nothing would surprise me at this time.
[01:14:50.686 --> 01:15:02.970]  I believe that the law enforcement heroes of the Las Vegas jurisdiction are literally doing the greatest job I may have ever witnessed in not only stopping the shooting, but also the investigation.
[01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:05.890]  But you're right, Alex, we have to be suspicious.
[01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:07.211]  Our founding fathers and all
[01:15:07.991 --> 01:15:14.897]  All citizens of America who knows that this is a sacred experiment in self-government, we must always be suspicious.
[01:15:14.897 --> 01:15:18.159]  We must always question the information that we're given.
[01:15:18.159 --> 01:15:23.083]  And that's why I salute you, because you are an ass-kicken.
[01:15:23.083 --> 01:15:27.787]  We the people, Concord Bridge American Patriot, who asked
[01:15:28.468 --> 01:15:29.629]  We're doing it.
[01:15:29.629 --> 01:15:30.190]  Ted Nugent.
[01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:31.311]  Gotta go to break.
[01:15:31.311 --> 01:15:32.133]  Stay right there.
[01:15:42.631 --> 01:15:47.276]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.
[01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:54.923]  InfoWars Life brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.

[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:22.030]  Instead of containing fluoride, our super blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand selected for their oral health benefits.
[01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:29.056]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[01:16:29.056 --> 01:16:31.939]  Xylitol, Nano Silver, and Iodine.
[01:16:31.939 --> 01:16:35.542]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[01:16:35.542 --> 01:16:40.546]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:16:40.546 --> 01:16:42.448]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:16:42.808 --> 01:16:46.569]  What exactly is political correctness, and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[01:16:46.569 --> 01:16:52.751]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion.
[01:16:52.751 --> 01:17:01.694]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in a ripple effect.
[01:17:01.934 --> 01:17:04.356]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[01:17:04.356 --> 01:17:08.200]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.903]  And over time, we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[01:17:11.903 --> 01:17:15.306]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[01:17:15.306 --> 01:17:23.854]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth.
[01:17:23.854 --> 01:17:25.315]  Such as global warming, for example.
[01:17:25.515 --> 01:17:34.687]  Then the establishment suppresses any counter-arguments to their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs, racists, or in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[01:17:34.687 --> 01:17:41.215]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and our YouTube channel, Resistance News.

[01:18:52.072 --> 01:18:52.613]  That's right.
[01:18:52.613 --> 01:18:57.875]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.

[01:19:12.142 --> 01:19:12.362]  Woo!
[01:19:12.362 --> 01:19:13.403]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:19:13.403 --> 01:19:22.127]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:19:22.127 --> 01:19:31.732]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:19:31.732 --> 01:19:35.173]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:19:35.173 --> 01:19:39.295]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:19:39.295 --> 01:19:40.136]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:19:40.356 --> 01:19:47.340]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com!
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:56.304]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:19:56.304 --> 01:19:59.346]  Down on the shackles
[01:20:10.509 --> 01:20:23.321]  The big part of having shackles on us, ladies and gentlemen, is having our guns taken away.
[01:20:23.321 --> 01:20:33.371]  And the exciting part about it is, the leftists admit that all over the country they're losing and people are becoming pro-gun.
[01:20:33.371 --> 01:20:34.772]  But there's a scary side to that.
[01:20:35.802 --> 01:20:41.527]  Talking to some of the gun rangers I go to, they say the biggest new group they see are liberals, but they're not there.
[01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:47.811]  Being converted to the Second Amendment, they believe they're preparing for civil war with us.
[01:20:47.811 --> 01:20:50.092]  So there's a total paradox here.
[01:20:50.092 --> 01:20:53.053]  And then they won't stand for a moment of silence.
[01:20:53.053 --> 01:20:56.854]  They won't put their hand over their heart for the American flag.
[01:20:56.854 --> 01:21:00.995]  Michelle Obama says the problem with America is there's so many white people in government.
[01:21:00.995 --> 01:21:02.876]  They're just pushing classical racism.
[01:21:02.876 --> 01:21:04.136]  It's so sick.
[01:21:04.136 --> 01:21:06.857]  And we have Democrats everywhere calling for revolution.
[01:21:07.837 --> 01:21:17.926]  And so many Democrats, vice presidents of CBS, you name it, saying the folks that died in Vegas deserve to die because they were white Republicans.
[01:21:17.926 --> 01:21:19.768]  It's like the nastiest.
[01:21:21.092 --> 01:21:26.297]  Craziest, weirdest people, and they're almost all white people.
[01:21:26.297 --> 01:21:29.539]  Domesticated, weird, white executives.
[01:21:29.539 --> 01:21:33.823]  And I don't know, it's like mass mental illness that Ted Nugent's been talking about forever.
[01:21:33.823 --> 01:21:35.144]  TedNugent.com.
[01:21:35.144 --> 01:21:37.386]  He joins us from Michigan.
[01:21:37.386 --> 01:21:40.048]  Ted, you've got the floor here in this segment, the next.
[01:21:40.048 --> 01:21:44.232]  I mean, talking about the mental illness of these people, they have no decency.
[01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:44.933]  What's going on?
[01:21:46.024 --> 01:21:48.667]  Well, you know, thanks for the opportunity.
[01:21:48.667 --> 01:21:52.613]  I'm not just speaking on behalf of myself as an individual or just my family.
[01:21:52.613 --> 01:21:58.120]  I get to spend a lot of intimate time with great, great American families, especially this time of year, Alex.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:02.966]  It's the hunting season, which is the ultimate conservation and environmental benefit.
[01:22:03.326 --> 01:22:08.608]  That you can perform for the good Mother Earth, that's to hunt, fish, and trap, and harvest the surplus, and give thanks.
[01:22:08.608 --> 01:22:27.257]  So my point is, is that the people I communicate with around a campfire, literally every day, September, October, November, December, January, mostly in Michigan and Texas, but also up in Ontario, out in California, hunting camps all around, these people unload, they unleash, they're uninhibited around a campfire.
[01:22:27.257 --> 01:22:31.519]  And so when I speak, Alex, it's not just my point of view.
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:37.471]  It's the living, breathing pulse of good Americans that are in the asset column.
[01:22:37.471 --> 01:22:38.934]  And we know that when
[01:22:40.383 --> 01:22:44.386]  The left movement is based on the hands-up, don't shoot lie.
[01:22:44.386 --> 01:22:54.633]  They know it's a lie, but they maniacally cling to it for an agenda that is against freedom, against America, against rugged individualism.
[01:22:54.633 --> 01:23:08.082]  When you have a leftist movement that's based on the Black Lives Matter, but they don't give a rat's ass about the death orgy in Chicago every day, you know that it's not just disingenuous.
[01:23:08.542 --> 01:23:10.344]  It's soulless.
[01:23:10.344 --> 01:23:13.466]  These people have no soul, like you mentioned.
[01:23:13.466 --> 01:23:14.887]  It's worth repeating.
[01:23:14.887 --> 01:23:22.794]  You have a CBS executive that was educated, actually brainwashed by the American anti-education system, who literally
[01:23:23.892 --> 01:23:34.678]  Alex, you couldn't write a script that's the sequel to Planet of the Apes, flew over the cuckoo's nest, clockwork Dayglo, Mad Magazine Hell, Twilight Zone, and come up with more absurd
[01:23:52.982 --> 01:23:54.883]  And they're getting crazier, Ted.
[01:23:54.883 --> 01:23:56.704]  That's the thing as I'm watching them.
[01:23:56.704 --> 01:23:58.144]  When do we hit peak craziness?
[01:23:58.144 --> 01:24:03.026]  Because it seems like, I keep thinking we've hit peak craziness and it just gets even more crazy.
[01:24:03.026 --> 01:24:18.872]  Well, you know, in reference to, in responding to your point about the left literally squaloring about a revolution and they're going to gun rangers and they're arming up, these people I share campfires with,
[01:24:19.694 --> 01:24:28.510]  The right, the conservatives, the republicans, the good people of this country will never start a revolution.
[01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:29.652]  It will have to come.
[01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:40.930]  From the hate mongers in Antifa, and the liberals, and the Democrats, and the Black Lives Matter terrorists, and the hands-up-don't-shoot liars.
[01:24:40.930 --> 01:24:50.714]  If that's where it comes from, and Alex, I don't believe it will because they have big mouths, they have no heart, they have no soul, and they're consumed with hate.
[01:24:50.714 --> 01:24:53.315]  I don't think they have the courage to really fight.
[01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:58.639]  Truly fight and put themselves in harm's way for the lie that they live every day.
[01:24:58.639 --> 01:25:08.227]  So I believe that the Republicans, the Conservatives, we the people in the acid column of America, we already have a revolution going on.
[01:25:08.227 --> 01:25:09.648]  We got Donald Trump going.
[01:25:09.648 --> 01:25:17.995]  It is a we the people voting revolution where the apathy is slowly being discarded and we're taking on our responsibility.
[01:25:18.075 --> 01:25:21.799]  And Ted, I totally agree with you, because we're winning the information war.
[01:25:21.799 --> 01:25:25.022]  We're winning with Americana, with success, with excellence.
[01:25:25.022 --> 01:25:26.383]  It's spreading like wildfire.
[01:25:26.383 --> 01:25:29.546]  So the insanity is their political death throes.
[01:25:29.546 --> 01:25:31.989]  So who shoots first, loses.
[01:25:31.989 --> 01:25:37.414]  And so yes, but if they do start a physical war, I think you were about to say, we're not going to start it, but we're going to finish it.
[01:25:38.615 --> 01:25:55.972]  Well, you know, hanging out with the Marines like I did last week in Okinawa, one of the Marines' battle cries is that they'll never leave a brother behind, and that the Marines are the greatest friends you could have and the worst enemies you could have, and that they will
[01:25:56.866 --> 01:26:00.307]  Take on any challenge and finish it.
[01:26:00.307 --> 01:26:02.908]  And that's the kind of people I hang out with.
[01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:19.293]  And if there is a revolution, can you imagine the stoned hippie punks in Antifa taking on country fans or rock and roll fans, the conservatives, the hunters, the shooters, the competitors, the gun nuts?
[01:26:19.293 --> 01:26:22.614]  Can you imagine the quick end that would come to that?
[01:26:23.494 --> 01:26:24.815]  Well that's what's crazy.
[01:26:24.815 --> 01:26:40.140]  They admit they're trying to intimidate us and they take our kindness for weakness and our restraint for weakness but we're just getting more politically involved as they get more violent and beating them and it's exposing them and even Pelosi has to admit they're a terror group and now they're being listed as a terror group.
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:41.901]  We're cleaning their clocks.
[01:26:41.901 --> 01:26:50.904]  That's why it's so important we continue to be peaceful and hold our fire even as it comes out that this guy was connected to Antifa and islamicist
[01:26:51.144 --> 01:26:57.674]  And it's a horrible thing they did, but we're winning and so it's key to stay non-violent offensively.
[01:26:57.674 --> 01:27:03.302]  Yes, we should defend ourselves like the HRT and the police did when they killed this guy.
[01:27:04.548 --> 01:27:17.251]  Absolutely, and the most important thing I can say, and this cannot be overstated, an American who believes in peace and security and freedom has got to be a member of the National Rightful Association.
[01:27:17.251 --> 01:27:20.172]  That is the force of We the People.
[01:27:20.172 --> 01:27:29.854]  Remember, the National Rightful Association is simply a family, grassroots organization that will not allow our Second Amendment rights to be infringed.
[01:27:29.854 --> 01:27:31.194]  That's all the NRA is.
[01:27:31.194 --> 01:27:32.475]  It's We the People.
[01:27:32.475 --> 01:27:33.575]  It's good citizens of this
[01:27:33.955 --> 01:27:35.778]  And the globalists know it.
[01:27:35.778 --> 01:27:45.349]  That's why Hillary, that's why Cobain, that's why all the usual Obermans said, quote, that the NRA is a terror organization that needs to be outlawed.
[01:27:45.349 --> 01:27:47.572]  So they're saying gun owners are terrorists now.
[01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:55.018]  Well, my response to the late night so-called comedians that aren't funny at all, they say we have to do something.
[01:27:55.018 --> 01:27:56.200]  We just have to do something.
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:59.123]  They throw their hands up and they say, we have to do something.
[01:27:59.123 --> 01:28:03.309]  Well, Alex, you know, throwing a cinder block to a drowning child is something.
[01:28:03.309 --> 01:28:03.409]  Yes.
[01:28:03.409 --> 01:28:05.151]  But it's the wrong thing.
[01:28:05.151 --> 01:28:06.352]  We don't need to do something.
[01:28:06.352 --> 01:28:07.634]  We need to do the right thing.
[01:28:08.574 --> 01:28:13.297]  Well, look, Jimmy Kimmel has five to seven bodyguards with guns at all times.
[01:28:13.297 --> 01:28:14.077]  It's on video.
[01:28:14.077 --> 01:28:20.140]  But he says some poor, you know, sheet worker, you know, a metal worker can't have a shotgun.
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:21.001]  But stay right there.
[01:28:21.001 --> 01:28:23.462]  One more segment with Ted Nugent straight ahead.
[01:28:23.462 --> 01:28:29.205]  We're going to talk about the revolution to restore the republic and what the panic left will do next to try to stop us.
[01:28:29.205 --> 01:28:30.886]  We got him in a stranglehold.
[01:28:30.886 --> 01:28:31.947]  Know that for sure.
[01:28:31.947 --> 01:28:32.527]  We'll be back.
[01:28:41.755 --> 01:28:52.237]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking such steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit, by consolidation of power first and then corruption its necessary consequence.
[01:28:52.237 --> 01:29:00.318]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite, the 1% of the 1%, consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government.
[01:29:00.318 --> 01:29:02.439]  Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice.
[01:29:02.439 --> 01:29:08.540]  We now live in a neo-feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:16.568]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[01:29:16.568 --> 01:29:24.456]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world.
[01:29:24.676 --> 01:29:32.966]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[01:29:32.966 --> 01:29:40.275]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[01:29:40.275 --> 01:29:42.758]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com

[01:30:43.874 --> 01:30:45.755]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:30:45.755 --> 01:30:47.795]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:30:47.795 --> 01:30:50.696]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:30:50.696 --> 01:30:56.757]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:30:56.757 --> 01:31:05.940]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:10.801]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[01:31:11.041 --> 01:31:13.486]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:31:13.486 --> 01:31:21.521]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:31:21.521 --> 01:31:22.604]  The general public doesn't.
[01:31:23.699 --> 01:31:27.640]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:31.201]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:31:31.201 --> 01:31:37.903]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:31:37.903 --> 01:31:42.104]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:44.031 --> 01:31:48.758]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:31:48.758 --> 01:31:59.394]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had
[01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:01.795]  Much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:32:01.795 --> 01:32:08.459]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:32:08.459 --> 01:32:11.020]  And so I set out to develop Caveman.
[01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:17.624]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[01:32:17.884 --> 01:32:18.564]  We're good.
[01:32:47.243 --> 01:33:04.956]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:04.956 --> 01:33:13.182]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:24.045]  Yeah, that's a liner from about six years ago, basically pointing out that Obama was destroying America and turning it into like a world government, UN, globalist hellhole.
[01:33:24.045 --> 01:33:27.467]  But now, that intro is almost obsolete.
[01:33:27.467 --> 01:33:34.351]  Not the great stranglehold with the great Ted Nugent bringing us in, but the fact that we're in FEMA Region 6 under global control.
[01:33:34.351 --> 01:33:40.895]  We're out of the TPP, our borders are getting secured, we're starting to take care of our military, the stock market's up, we've got a 3% growth rate.
[01:33:42.426 --> 01:33:49.771]  going on that they said Trump could never do, and that's with only a little bit of the Make America Great Again agenda in place.
[01:33:49.771 --> 01:33:57.076]  Then they tried to claim he didn't respond well to Puerto Rico when the Democrats got caught ordering a stand-down by the unions.
[01:33:57.076 --> 01:34:05.282]  I mean, again, the level of their evil is only outmatched by their arrogance and the fact that they think they're invincible.
[01:34:05.282 --> 01:34:07.263]  What's wrong with these punks, Ted Nugent?
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:11.424]  Well, you know, you say the former United States of America.
[01:34:11.424 --> 01:34:20.093]  I hear from my buddies in New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, Illinois, California, those states that I just mentioned, Alex.
[01:34:20.093 --> 01:34:22.636]  It is not America anymore.
[01:34:22.636 --> 01:34:25.119]  They have no Second Amendment.
[01:34:25.119 --> 01:34:25.940]  They can't keep
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.041]  We're good.
[01:34:43.719 --> 01:34:56.122]  The curse, the self-inflicted scourge of apathy is being whittled away by electing Donald Trump in otherwise known as reliably blue states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, for example.
[01:34:56.122 --> 01:34:59.243]  The prognosis is quite good, actually.
[01:34:59.243 --> 01:35:10.466]  Following eight years of anti-Americanism and the Benghazi and the lies and the deceit and the gun-running, fast and furious murder of American citizens and border patrol agents by our own government,
[01:35:10.886 --> 01:35:16.974]  It really is heartbreaking and catastrophic, but again, I really have faith in my fellow Americans.
[01:35:16.974 --> 01:35:26.305]  The spirit and the indefatigable energy that we the people are now once again displaying, and again, manifest yourself in voting
[01:35:26.305 --> 01:35:33.050]  I think for Donald Trump, because he's an outsider, he's a status quo crusher, and all things status quo have to be crushed.
[01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:45.439]  Now, that's why I admire what you do, Alex Jones, is you crush the status quo and you spotlight cockroaches and you ask questions, and we're demanding constitutional accountability from our elected employees.
[01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:52.604]  So the swamp hasn't been drained, it's a MercFest out there, but certainly the prognosis is better than you and I have witnessed in the last eight years.
[01:35:53.533 --> 01:36:01.275]  Well, we also had these Democrats, as you mentioned earlier off-air to me, that refused to stand for the moment of silence and said it was wrong.
[01:36:01.275 --> 01:36:10.717]  And then you have the NFL trying to bully Trump into saying, you know, that it's okay to not stand for the Pledge of Allegiance or put your hand over your heart.
[01:36:10.717 --> 01:36:13.538]  Now the NFL's had to back down, the NBA has.
[01:36:13.538 --> 01:36:15.939]  They're finding out the true power of America.
[01:36:15.939 --> 01:36:20.100]  Trump said it's not appropriate, it's disrespectful to our veterans and our country to do that.
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:23.701]  And they said, no, you're disrespecting the NFL.
[01:36:23.701 --> 01:36:25.942]  That was the head of the NFL.
[01:36:25.942 --> 01:36:27.463]  He had to back down pretty quick.
[01:36:27.463 --> 01:36:30.985]  But again, we're winning, but the arrogance of these people is frightening.
[01:36:31.854 --> 01:36:37.797]  Well, remember, it was the NFL, too, that literally continued the lie of hands up, don't shoot.
[01:36:37.797 --> 01:36:39.638]  There hasn't been any hands up, don't shoot.
[01:36:39.638 --> 01:36:40.339]  Never happened.
[01:36:40.339 --> 01:36:41.259]  It's a lie.
[01:36:41.259 --> 01:36:52.746]  And these goofballs, these uneducated, spoiled, overpaid brats, obviously the concussions are already happening at a fast rate because you have to have a concussion.
[01:36:52.746 --> 01:36:59.590]  Your brain has to be wounded and bloodshot to perpetrate and continue the lie of hands up,
[01:36:59.730 --> 01:37:00.110]  Don't shoot!
[01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:30.250]  You're right.
[01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:32.732]  They wear their ignorance like a cloak of invincibility.
[01:37:44.991 --> 01:37:50.613]  I mean, they're supposed to be anti-fascist, and I've got a couple things I've got to share with you.
[01:37:50.613 --> 01:37:56.255]  So, you're anti-fascist, so you use fascist techniques.
[01:37:56.255 --> 01:38:11.180]  You occupied Wall Street, but you got to your protest by using Wall Street transportation, wearing Wall Street clothes, eating Wall Street food, and using Wall Street handheld devices to protest.
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:15.644]  Wall Street, I mean, this is planet... These people have to be on acid!
[01:38:15.644 --> 01:38:18.226]  Do they put LSD on their Cheerios?
[01:38:18.226 --> 01:38:28.576]  You have to be brain dead and protect that stupidity to a maniacal degree to not know that you're protesting the system by which you have life!
[01:38:30.228 --> 01:38:32.491]  Wow, Ted Nugent is on fire.
[01:38:32.491 --> 01:38:33.352]  You're a smart guy.
[01:38:33.352 --> 01:38:34.033]  Family guy.
[01:38:34.033 --> 01:38:34.894]  Successful in business.
[01:38:34.894 --> 01:38:38.999]  Not just one of the top guitarists out there in history.
[01:38:38.999 --> 01:38:44.425]  But as libertarians, as conservatives, as patriots, as Americana, we need to look into the future.
[01:38:44.425 --> 01:38:45.747]  They've only gotten more radical.
[01:38:45.747 --> 01:38:46.908]  They've only gotten more crazy.
[01:38:46.908 --> 01:38:48.070]  They've been calling for an October.
[01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:49.771]  November surprise.
[01:38:49.771 --> 01:38:55.913]  All the experts are saying this guy has the same cut out as the loon that went and shot Scalise and others who wanted a special election.
[01:38:55.913 --> 01:38:59.254]  He wanted to kill 15 members of Congress at least.
[01:38:59.254 --> 01:39:00.815]  And that even came out on Fox yesterday.
[01:39:00.815 --> 01:39:06.818]  So Scalise has come out and said he believes more in the Second Amendment now than ever because it was guns that helped save him.
[01:39:06.818 --> 01:39:08.258]  But they're going to double down.
[01:39:08.258 --> 01:39:09.479]  They're going to get violent.
[01:39:10.459 --> 01:39:12.140]  And they're going to intensify.
[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:15.462]  I agree, most of them are wimps, but enough of them are crazy.
[01:39:15.462 --> 01:39:21.545]  In your gut, I agree we're going to win, but what do we need to do to win politically and intellectually?
[01:39:21.545 --> 01:39:27.268]  And just in your gut, as a smart guy, what do you think these snakes are going to do next?
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:31.664]  Well, thank God for social media.
[01:39:31.664 --> 01:39:36.589]  It can be a pain in the ass, but it can also be a huge benefit to meaningful communication.
[01:39:36.589 --> 01:39:40.974]  If you go to my Facebook, Alex, you'll see tens of millions of people.
[01:39:40.974 --> 01:39:47.941]  Facebook hippies claim I only have three and a half million, but I recently had over 12 million responses to one of my posts.
[01:39:47.941 --> 01:39:49.863]  So if you go to my Ted Nugent Facebook,
[01:39:50.143 --> 01:40:03.692]  You'll see that millions and millions of people share the common sense, the logic, the goodwill, the decency, the self-evident truth that Alex Jones and Ted Nugent live by, that quality of life is determined by.
[01:40:03.692 --> 01:40:13.119]  But then you get the occasional leftist, liberal, dope-smoking maniac who wants to kill my wife because we eat pheasant.
[01:40:14.002 --> 01:40:16.684]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:40:16.684 --> 01:40:24.888]  And I've got to also allude to what you brought up about Scalise, talking about a great spokesman for our Second Amendment self-evident truth.
[01:40:24.888 --> 01:40:39.797]  Here's a guy who was gunned down by an Illinois resident who had a firearms owner ID card in his pocket, because Illinois back in the 70s passed a law that you had to go through some government scrutiny in Illinois
[01:40:40.157 --> 01:40:47.182]  To buy .22 ammo to buy a rifle or a pistol or a shotgun, even just for weekend recreational hunting activities.
[01:40:47.182 --> 01:40:58.790]  The guy that gunned down Scalise passed all the strictest gun control regulations in Illinois and had an Illinois firearms owner ID card in his pocket.
[01:40:58.790 --> 01:41:01.312]  And God knows that made the world safer.
[01:41:01.312 --> 01:41:03.013]  The left are out.
[01:41:03.673 --> 01:41:05.335]  Of their minds!
[01:41:05.335 --> 01:41:08.519]  Watch Nancy Pelosi try to form a syllable!
[01:41:08.519 --> 01:41:13.746]  Watch Maxine Waters try to stumble onto a cognitive thought!
[01:41:13.746 --> 01:41:18.812]  And you look at your Democrat friends and go, are you with these people?
[01:41:18.812 --> 01:41:20.554]  I don't have Democrat friends anymore!
[01:41:20.554 --> 01:41:21.916]  I don't have because they're so crazy!
[01:41:24.133 --> 01:41:24.374]  They do.
[01:41:37.515 --> 01:41:52.947]  It is a pleasure, and then the good people of every race, color, and creed, all our folks are just red-blooded, strong, have a gleam in their eye, be they black, white, it doesn't matter, and you look at liberals, they literally look like they've never been out of the house in a hundred years, like they got run over by a car.
[01:41:52.947 --> 01:41:54.869]  I mean, I'm sorry, they're just, they're just...
[01:41:55.189 --> 01:42:02.195]  Mentally ill, like you said, and we've just got to protect ourselves from them and just try to move forward and keep making America great again, and we're doing it.
[01:42:02.195 --> 01:42:03.096]  We've turned the tide.
[01:42:03.096 --> 01:42:04.037]  TedNugent.com.
[01:42:04.037 --> 01:42:10.942]  We've got to pray for all those families and all those victims, but they will not be sacrificed on the altar of globalism to disarm America.
[01:42:10.942 --> 01:42:14.445]  They'll only make us stronger, and so that's my final point on that.
[01:42:14.445 --> 01:42:16.587]  Ted Nugent, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:42:16.587 --> 01:42:17.148]  Final comment.
[01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:26.779]  Thank you, Alex, and I look forward to seeing everybody at my Facebook page, and we will celebrate the National Rifle Association as we the people who keep and bear arms.
[01:42:26.779 --> 01:42:28.620]  Alright, Uncle Ted, let me say bye to you during the break.
[01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.002]  Thanks for giving us so much time.
[01:42:30.002 --> 01:42:36.028]  We got big breaking news on the Las Vegas attacks and more on the other side with investigative journalist Laura Loomer.
[01:42:36.028 --> 01:42:38.050]  She's got contacts inside the hotel.
[01:42:38.050 --> 01:42:38.630]  Stay with us.
[01:42:38.630 --> 01:42:39.811]  That was Ted Nugent.
[01:42:39.811 --> 01:42:40.212]  Stay with us.
[01:42:43.473 --> 01:42:50.841]  I'm very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:42:50.841 --> 01:43:04.074]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[01:43:42.654 --> 01:43:51.745]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:43:51.745 --> 01:43:59.874]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:44:00.134 --> 01:44:00.574]  We have now
[01:44:29.994 --> 01:44:30.495]  I don't think so.
[01:44:45.209 --> 01:44:48.972]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:44:48.972 --> 01:44:56.717]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:44:56.717 --> 01:45:05.323]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:45:05.323 --> 01:45:14.909]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:45:15.329 --> 01:45:19.572]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:45:19.572 --> 01:45:22.974]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:45:22.974 --> 01:45:34.121]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:45:34.121 --> 01:45:37.043]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[01:45:37.043 --> 01:45:43.007]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.

[01:46:39.817 --> 01:46:46.762]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:46:46.762 --> 01:46:49.364]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:58.953 --> 01:47:00.113]  Democrats have lost.
[01:47:00.113 --> 01:47:04.454]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:47:04.454 --> 01:47:08.455]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:08.455 --> 01:47:15.896]  I'll say it.
[01:47:15.896 --> 01:47:24.358]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:24.358 --> 01:47:26.839]  This is the defense of the republic.
[01:47:26.839 --> 01:47:27.579]  It's the real deal.
[01:47:27.579 --> 01:47:28.019]  We're doing it.
[01:47:28.789 --> 01:47:30.430]  The enemy's engaging us.
[01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:34.151]  Everybody needs to be packing like I told you on Friday and on Sunday.
[01:47:34.151 --> 01:47:37.713]  Get ready, Democrats are going to be killing people, a lot of folks.
[01:47:37.713 --> 01:47:45.236]  And obviously, just like you don't see conservatives going out and doing mass shootings, they don't want to blame the Second Amendment, they don't want to go out and kill people.
[01:47:45.236 --> 01:47:51.359]  It's almost always drug-head Democrats, devil-worshippers, you name it, that's their M.O.
[01:47:51.359 --> 01:47:55.141]  The Democrats know when they mass kill now, they know to not
[01:47:57.845 --> 01:47:59.326]  Say they're Democrat operatives.
[01:47:59.326 --> 01:48:03.610]  They just want to use that to get the Second Amendment and get a civil war going.
[01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:05.792]  But he had anti-fun material inside.
[01:48:05.792 --> 01:48:09.555]  The sheriff's now coming out saying they're investigating that, which means they found evidence.
[01:48:09.555 --> 01:48:11.236]  Just like I told you, that's huge.
[01:48:11.236 --> 01:48:16.581]  Laura Loomer's going to be riding shotgun with us 30 minutes to the next hour with Craig Sawyer, former SEAL Team leader.
[01:48:16.581 --> 01:48:19.003]  I'm not going to get into what SEAL Team he was with because he doesn't want us to.
[01:48:19.003 --> 01:48:23.367]  But as you say, he's an elite operator and a weapons expert.
[01:48:23.367 --> 01:48:24.648]  He's got a lot to say about
[01:48:25.609 --> 01:48:29.233]  The firearms, the concussion, were there multiple guns?
[01:48:29.233 --> 01:48:36.161]  A lot of other sources say clearly there are other well-known operators and also folks that are under the radar.
[01:48:36.161 --> 01:48:37.002]  That's all coming up.
[01:48:37.987 --> 01:48:40.308]  But we got big developments here, obviously.
[01:48:40.308 --> 01:48:52.054]  But Laura Loomer has been working her Twitter to a great extent as an investigative journalist, and she's been talking to hotel staff, getting information that nobody else has had.
[01:48:52.054 --> 01:48:54.015]  Trump is now arriving in Las Vegas.
[01:48:54.015 --> 01:48:58.798]  We'll show you some footage of that as it happens right now over me while I talk.
[01:49:00.031 --> 01:49:03.833]  For radio listeners, obviously there's no point in showing you visuals, but it'll be for the TV viewers.
[01:49:03.833 --> 01:49:06.555]  So there is the door of Air Force One open.
[01:49:06.555 --> 01:49:09.196]  Trump is a hands-on, can-do guy.
[01:49:09.196 --> 01:49:16.300]  He's there exposing the fact that they had a stand-down, the Democrats did, and the unions had a stand-down, the Teamsters in Puerto Rico.
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:21.863]  He's trying to get their $70-plus billion debt forgiven and restructured and actually trying to just fix the whole...
[01:49:25.425 --> 01:49:39.131]  The Democrats are just melting down in hatred as Puerto Ricans just absolutely fall into his arms, knowing Trump will deliver if they just actually become free market and get the vampire Democrats off their necks.
[01:49:39.131 --> 01:49:40.992]  And Millie Weaver is joining us at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:49:40.992 --> 01:49:46.375]  She's doing parallel investigations and has collated a lot of amazing information at the bottom of the hour.
[01:49:46.375 --> 01:49:47.916]  She'll be joining us in studio.
[01:49:49.155 --> 01:49:52.096]  Before we go any further, just briefly, we need to fund our operation.
[01:49:52.096 --> 01:49:54.677]  And I'm so on top of covering this, I've not been plugging.
[01:49:54.677 --> 01:49:58.178]  So when you hear us plug, please take special note that we're under globalist attack.
[01:49:58.178 --> 01:50:00.139]  We're the tip of the spear.
[01:50:00.139 --> 01:50:01.240]  And we've got great products.
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:02.560]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:03.781]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:50:03.781 --> 01:50:06.342]  I had thought we could keep this selling for another week or so.
[01:50:06.342 --> 01:50:07.382]  It's about to sell out.
[01:50:07.382 --> 01:50:09.583]  People have really taken advantage of it.
[01:50:09.583 --> 01:50:09.883]  A 50% off.
[01:50:09.883 --> 01:50:11.884]  That's going to end today.
[01:50:11.884 --> 01:50:13.524]  Brain Force Plus.
[01:50:13.524 --> 01:50:14.345]  It's 50% off.
[01:50:14.345 --> 01:50:15.585]  That just started two days ago.
[01:50:15.585 --> 01:50:17.546]  That can go for another week, maybe.
[01:50:17.546 --> 01:50:17.926]  But at that
[01:50:18.246 --> 01:50:20.969]  Price it really is 50% off that great nootropic.
[01:50:20.969 --> 01:50:22.390]  If you haven't tried it yet you really should.
[01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:24.732]  Now 20% more in each bottle.
[01:50:24.732 --> 01:50:27.975]  You can sign up for auto ship an additional 10% off.
[01:50:27.975 --> 01:50:29.477]  That makes it a loss leader.
[01:50:29.477 --> 01:50:30.658]  All orders of $50 or more.
[01:50:32.472 --> 01:50:34.072]  are free shipping.
[01:50:34.072 --> 01:50:37.053]  So free shipping at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:50:37.053 --> 01:50:38.934]  Secret 12, 40% off.
[01:50:38.934 --> 01:50:41.454]  Highest quality methylcobalamin, vitamin B12.
[01:50:41.454 --> 01:50:47.776]  Rated by third-party rating agencies as the very best vitamin B12 sold on the open market.
[01:50:47.776 --> 01:50:53.037]  BuzzFeed got pretty freaked out when they had it tested and they found that.
[01:50:53.037 --> 01:50:56.198]  But Alexa Pure Breeze, air purifier, 20% off.
[01:50:56.198 --> 01:50:59.098]  Already the very low price for a limited time.
[01:50:59.098 --> 01:50:59.618]  Oxy powder, 25% off.
[01:50:59.618 --> 01:50:59.798]  Caveman
[01:51:04.329 --> 01:51:10.556]  With the turmeric and the chaga and the bee pollen and so much more of the alfalfa powder.
[01:51:10.556 --> 01:51:15.361]  Talk about energy, talk about stamina, talk about good for your bones, good for your joints.
[01:51:15.361 --> 01:51:18.425]  The power is in the bones and the ancients knew that.
[01:51:18.425 --> 01:51:20.367]  This is the ultimate bone broth formula.
[01:51:20.367 --> 01:51:24.492]  It's 50% off and that's got to end in the next few days as well.
[01:51:25.032 --> 01:51:29.175]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or AAA2533139.
[01:51:29.175 --> 01:51:32.697]  I want to thank you all for your financial support.
[01:51:32.697 --> 01:51:44.224]  What I really need is prayers for myself, for my wife, and for my children, and for the crew, and for InfoWars, and for our affiliates, and for all of you as well, together, that truth and justice continue to come out.
[01:51:44.224 --> 01:51:52.068]  But make no mistake, the globalist forces that control the Democratic Party and the Republican leadership are launching an attempt at a civil war in America.
[01:51:52.068 --> 01:51:52.989]  We have the sources.
[01:51:52.989 --> 01:51:54.430]  This guy was connected to Antifab.
[01:51:55.632 --> 01:52:24.654]  and connected to islamicists that's now emerging so bombshell events we have colonel schaefer of army and the cia high-level saying his intel is exactly the same we have high-level government psychiatrist saying the same thing that's all up on info wars dot com drug report dot com has his top linked right now uh... with the fact that he was on drugs like we predicted he would be psychotropic style anti-psychotic drugs that can make you blackout uh... he was also uh... of course got a prescription the day before uh... refilled it
[01:52:25.374 --> 01:52:31.596]  We also know that again they're investigating connections to radical groups and we know he had room service for two and so much more.
[01:52:31.596 --> 01:52:35.957]  A lot of that's exclusive from Laura Loomer in our article linked up in Drudge.
[01:52:35.957 --> 01:52:38.178]  So true investigative journalism from Laura Loomer.
[01:52:38.178 --> 01:52:43.039]  Laura, tell us the latest in your investigative journalism from your sources that you've gleaned.
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:44.000]  Yeah.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:44.561]  Hi, Alex.
[01:52:44.561 --> 01:52:47.923]  So early this morning, I have not slept.
[01:52:47.923 --> 01:52:51.386]  I was up all night gathering information regarding these receipts.
[01:52:51.386 --> 01:53:05.057]  There's a Hispanic room service employee at the Mandalay Hotel who made a Facebook post in which he, as you can see on the screen right there, he showed pictures of the receipts from Steven Paddock's room.
[01:53:05.057 --> 01:53:09.100]  And as you can see from the receipt, it says in-room dining
[01:53:10.481 --> 01:53:19.304]  So it's IRDMB, and then it's 32135, which stands for Room 135 on the 32nd floor.
[01:53:19.304 --> 01:53:21.425]  And it says that he had two guests.
[01:53:21.425 --> 01:53:31.570]  So this goes against everything that the FBI and the Las Vegas Police Department has been reporting to the American people and the public, in which they said that he was alone in his room and didn't have a guest.
[01:53:31.570 --> 01:53:35.252]  And then they also told us that he checked in on the 28th.
[01:53:36.272 --> 01:53:39.836]  But if you look at the date on the receipt, it says the 27th.
[01:53:39.836 --> 01:53:47.583]  And my source is a source who has access to the booking information, an employee at the Mandalay Resort Hotel.
[01:53:47.583 --> 01:53:53.068]  You had already said this yesterday on my show and published it before this even came out.
[01:53:53.068 --> 01:53:57.052]  Yes, that the shooter checked into the hotel on the 25th.
[01:53:58.280 --> 01:53:59.541]  So, I don't know why.
[01:53:59.541 --> 01:54:01.602]  I mean, there's obviously a cover-up going on here.
[01:54:01.602 --> 01:54:15.010]  The FBI... And now we know why there's Hispanic folks that were probably working in the hotel warning people, saying, get out of here, you're about to die, because the hotel had to know he's there with five days, 22 guns, all the ammo, two rooms, cameras outside the room.
[01:54:15.010 --> 01:54:17.332]  I mean, security would be there in five minutes!
[01:54:18.376 --> 01:54:33.526]  Right, and so, you know, I've been trying to tell people over the past 24 hours that the shooter has been inside that suite since the 25th of September, but for some reason the FBI and the Las Vegas Police Department have been lying and deceiving the American public.
[01:54:33.526 --> 01:54:36.688]  Why don't they want us to know that he checked in three days earlier?
[01:54:36.688 --> 01:54:37.708]  Why?
[01:54:37.708 --> 01:54:41.010]  It's just, it's mind-blowing, and they were caught in their own tracks lying.
[01:54:41.010 --> 01:54:42.371]  I mean, receipts do not lie.
[01:54:42.371 --> 01:54:43.312]  There's a time stamp
[01:54:43.852 --> 01:54:50.394]  And it says two guests with the room number and the floor of the hotel, and they're caught lying.
[01:54:50.394 --> 01:54:53.235]  And just like 9-11, they had Muslims running around New York.
[01:54:53.235 --> 01:54:57.957]  It was in major newspapers saying those towers won't be there on the 11th.
[01:54:57.957 --> 01:55:03.339]  There are people that knew here because he was preparing with a huge arsenal for five days.
[01:55:03.339 --> 01:55:10.942]  Thank God that, again, the Hispanic workers were running around warning everyone, and now they're posting stuff, receipts.
[01:55:12.193 --> 01:55:13.194]  Yeah, no, exactly.
[01:55:13.194 --> 01:55:14.595]  And he posted it in Spanish.
[01:55:14.595 --> 01:55:20.962]  If you look at my original tweet and the picture that Paul Joseph Walton posted, it's in Spanish.
[01:55:20.962 --> 01:55:23.244]  And I speak Spanish, so I translated it.
[01:55:23.244 --> 01:55:29.731]  And it says, it goes along the lines of... But you had the hotel worker that ran the data.
[01:55:29.731 --> 01:55:31.692]  We've had folks inside of that before as well.
[01:55:31.692 --> 01:55:32.874]  This is real investigative journalism.
[01:55:32.874 --> 01:55:35.256]  You were already reporting this before the receipts surfaced.
[01:55:35.256 --> 01:55:36.057]  This is incredible.
[01:55:36.701 --> 01:55:40.083]  Yeah, but my reporting suggests it's even two days earlier than the receipts.
[01:55:40.083 --> 01:55:47.127]  The receipts are saying the 27th, but my intel and my sources who work at the Mandalay Resort are saying the 25th.
[01:55:47.127 --> 01:55:59.775]  And I'm just saying, stay tuned for today's presser because Donald Trump, you know, he had a very dismal tone this morning when he was speaking to the media and said there's more information that's coming out and we've learned a lot and it's a very sad day for me.
[01:55:59.775 --> 01:56:06.219]  And I have a feeling that a lot of the information that I've been reporting and that you've been reporting here at InfoWars is going to be confirmed.
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:14.668]  And, you know, we're going to be vindicated today by the president and by this presser because they can't lie any longer.
[01:56:14.668 --> 01:56:21.055]  And I'm also being told that, you know, other sources have confirmed my date of September 25th.
[01:56:23.581 --> 01:56:24.883]  Wow, this is so dangerous.
[01:56:24.883 --> 01:56:27.986]  I just want people to know, this is the real deal we're involved in.
[01:56:27.986 --> 01:56:33.012]  The hostage rescue team was so concerned, they let us know within hours that, no, Alex, this is bull.
[01:56:33.012 --> 01:56:34.534]  There's Antifa stuff inside.
[01:56:34.534 --> 01:56:36.476]  There's more.
[01:56:36.476 --> 01:56:38.859]  Her going to Islamic countries, that came out later.
[01:56:38.859 --> 01:56:42.263]  This is a huge cover-up, Laura.
[01:56:42.970 --> 01:56:54.918]  And also too, I don't know if people caught this, but the Las Vegas Police Department, they said originally that she was in Tokyo after it was reported that she was in the Philippines.
[01:56:54.918 --> 01:56:59.021]  And then the reports are coming in this morning that she landed around midnight from the Philippines.
[01:56:59.021 --> 01:57:04.665]  So why are they telling us that she's in Tokyo when she was actually in the Philippines, which is being ravaged by ISIS?
[01:57:04.665 --> 01:57:12.110]  And then the sister of Mary Lou Delaney or whatever her name is, she came on today and she said, oh,
[01:57:13.566 --> 01:57:18.267]  Steven Paddock had her sent away so that she wouldn't interfere with what he was planning.
[01:57:19.514 --> 01:57:23.835]  That's right, it's all coming together and all this money, millions of dollars.
[01:57:23.835 --> 01:57:26.055]  Is he an Antifa globalist cutout?
[01:57:26.055 --> 01:57:27.976]  Is he a Patsy who was set up?
[01:57:27.976 --> 01:57:32.997]  It's all coming up with Laura Loomer, former SEALs and others.

[01:59:48.920 --> 02:00:00.028]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:00.028 --> 02:00:10.394]  So, Eric Paddock, Stephen Paddock, the supposed shooter, or the decoy's brother, has changed the story 180.
[02:00:10.394 --> 02:00:13.997]  It's a complete 180, from north to south, from east to west.
[02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:16.450]  Upside down world.
[02:00:16.450 --> 02:00:19.293]  He just said, oh, no guns, never involved anything.
[02:00:19.293 --> 02:00:21.195]  You know, just a normal person, blah, blah, blah.
[02:00:21.195 --> 02:00:22.996]  Forget his intelligence agency.
[02:00:22.996 --> 02:00:25.239]  Cut out and all the rest of it.
[02:00:25.239 --> 02:00:29.683]  Millions of dollars and Islamic, you know, girlfriends that have two husbands and world travelers.
[02:00:29.683 --> 02:00:35.649]  And these people look either like some type of crooks or intelligence agency people.
[02:00:35.649 --> 02:00:37.551]  And now the brother has totally 180'd this.
[02:00:39.304 --> 02:00:42.247]  Okay, and I'm not saying they look like that, the EMO looks like that.
[02:00:42.247 --> 02:00:44.589]  And oh, yes, he did it, 100%.
[02:00:44.589 --> 02:00:45.569]  He did it, he did it.
[02:00:45.569 --> 02:00:49.313]  Here is the bizarre back-to-back video.
[02:00:49.313 --> 02:00:52.095]  I mean, my brother did this.
[02:00:52.095 --> 02:00:55.438]  This is like it was done, you know, like he shot us.
[02:00:55.438 --> 02:01:03.405]  I mean, if he'd have killed my kids, I couldn't be more... This guy's the worst actor.
[02:01:05.059 --> 02:01:06.221]  I don't know.
[02:01:25.058 --> 02:01:25.699]  And he did.
[02:01:25.699 --> 02:01:27.180]  He made himself wealthy.
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:29.381]  He made us wealthy.
[02:01:29.381 --> 02:01:31.743]  He was a very successful person.
[02:01:31.743 --> 02:01:35.666]  He gambled for 20 plus years successfully.
[02:01:35.666 --> 02:01:37.287]  It's like a job to him.
[02:01:37.287 --> 02:01:38.968]  He did it mathematically.
[02:01:38.968 --> 02:01:46.434]  He did it because it was a way to have a fun life and he didn't go poor doing it.
[02:01:47.398 --> 02:01:50.060]  So, he didn't ever do any of it.
[02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:51.561]  Now he did it all.
[02:01:51.561 --> 02:01:55.364]  This guy is central casting, the squirreliest person I've ever seen.
[02:01:55.364 --> 02:01:58.246]  The dad was a psychopath, according to the FBI.
[02:01:58.246 --> 02:02:00.848]  Bank robber that tried to run FBI agents over.
[02:02:00.848 --> 02:02:06.852]  I mean, these guys, this whole family, is like demonic Muppets or something, from what I've seen.
[02:02:06.852 --> 02:02:10.295]  Laura Loomer, what in the hell, excuse me, what do you think's going on here?
[02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:14.191]  Alex, you just missed a really big part of this interview with the brother.
[02:02:14.191 --> 02:02:26.393]  As he was talking, it sounded like he had an earpiece in his ear, and he said, Steve was an arms, and it sounded like he was about to say arms dealer or something, and then they cut him off, and then he realizes his mistake, and then he says he's sorry.
[02:02:26.393 --> 02:02:35.635]  So you should definitely go back and play that footage, because that is very suspicious, given the fact that he had all of these weapons and other properties.
[02:02:36.055 --> 02:02:37.096]  It's funny you say that.
[02:02:37.096 --> 02:02:38.157]  That's where Millie's going.
[02:02:38.157 --> 02:02:46.662]  This was an arms deal gone bad with Jihadis that they set him up and that they then did the shooting and then that's what happened.
[02:02:46.662 --> 02:02:59.912]  But listen to that audio that you just played again because I was listening and I think you just missed one of the parts where it almost looks like he has something in his ear and he said Steve wasn't arms and then he realizes his mistake and of course I'm looking at this right now.
[02:02:59.912 --> 02:03:01.393]  Was that in the clip I just played or a clip you have?
[02:03:02.188 --> 02:03:03.129]  It's a clip.
[02:03:03.129 --> 02:03:08.093]  It's the same interview that you showed, but I don't think you isolated the correct part.
[02:03:08.093 --> 02:03:10.674]  Oh yeah, I was just showing him saying my brother didn't do anything.
[02:03:10.674 --> 02:03:11.955]  My brother did everything.
[02:03:11.955 --> 02:03:13.657]  I was just showing the contradiction.
[02:03:13.657 --> 02:03:16.259]  But yeah, send them the clip or the part of the clip.
[02:03:16.259 --> 02:03:20.062]  How long is the whole clip, guys?
[02:03:20.062 --> 02:03:20.702]  33 minutes.
[02:03:20.702 --> 02:03:22.924]  Laura, can you send them the clip you want played?
[02:03:22.924 --> 02:03:24.245]  Yeah, I'll send it right now.
[02:03:24.245 --> 02:03:25.346]  It's just a 10-second clip.
[02:03:25.346 --> 02:03:26.106]  It's very quick.
[02:03:26.106 --> 02:03:28.488]  Did you send it to Nika or did you send it to me?
[02:03:28.488 --> 02:03:29.749]  Yeah, I'll text it right now.
[02:03:33.766 --> 02:03:35.747]  I mean, this is just how fast everything is changing.
[02:03:35.747 --> 02:03:38.789]  You know, like, live time updates on the cell phone, having to report.
[02:03:38.789 --> 02:03:47.153]  I mean, I can't even begin to explain how many times I've had to charge my phone and it just keeps jamming and jamming and jamming because you just can't get this much information out.
[02:03:47.153 --> 02:03:48.934]  There's just too much... By the way, let me stop right there.
[02:03:48.934 --> 02:03:50.155]  You have a rule, guys.
[02:03:50.155 --> 02:03:52.036]  When you pop in, I want you to be on air.
[02:03:52.036 --> 02:03:52.817]  Were you just on air, Matt?
[02:03:56.127 --> 02:03:56.227]  Hey.
[02:04:24.935 --> 02:04:25.876]  Wow!
[02:04:25.876 --> 02:04:27.538]  We're going to get the clip she's talking about.
[02:04:27.538 --> 02:04:29.060]  This is insane.
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:33.005]  I want to isolate that clip as soon as we can and get it out on Twitter so people can share it.
[02:04:33.005 --> 02:04:36.910]  Because that's where we were already going in 30 minutes was the arms dealing.
[02:04:36.910 --> 02:04:38.532]  I have it right here in my notes.
[02:04:42.481 --> 02:04:44.402]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[02:04:44.402 --> 02:04:46.303]  That all men are created equal.
[02:04:46.303 --> 02:04:50.005]  That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.
[02:04:50.005 --> 02:04:53.427]  That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:04:53.427 --> 02:05:00.492]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[02:05:00.492 --> 02:05:09.637]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.
[02:05:11.281 --> 02:05:13.081]  Independence isn't a day.
[02:05:13.081 --> 02:05:14.102]  It's a mindset.
[02:05:14.102 --> 02:05:16.882]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[02:05:16.882 --> 02:05:18.482]  I will not be your slave.
[02:05:18.482 --> 02:05:24.544]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[02:05:24.544 --> 02:05:29.505]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[02:05:29.505 --> 02:05:31.405]  Slaves are never safe.
[02:05:31.405 --> 02:05:34.386]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[02:05:34.386 --> 02:05:35.486]  Guard your liberty.
[02:05:35.486 --> 02:05:38.827]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[02:05:38.827 --> 02:05:40.727]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:05:58.863 --> 02:06:04.346]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:04.346 --> 02:06:09.049]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:16.937 --> 02:06:24.841]  Ladies and gentlemen, I already have sources in the hostage rescue team that told us on Monday morning this is all bull.
[02:06:24.841 --> 02:06:32.366]  He had Antifa and Islamic literature and his common law wife was being sent around the Middle East.
[02:06:33.206 --> 02:06:39.992]  And that they were looking into it, the official story that there was no motive, was total bull, and they were getting ready to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:06:39.992 --> 02:06:42.774]  I called CIA people, current and former.
[02:06:42.774 --> 02:06:44.195]  I called federal marshals.
[02:06:44.195 --> 02:06:47.438]  I called, well I didn't have to call, I got called HRT people.
[02:06:47.438 --> 02:06:50.160]  I mean, I have a lot of sources obviously.
[02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:50.280]  And...
[02:06:51.423 --> 02:07:01.355]  Now it's all happening just like I was told at 8.30 in the morning by one of my high-level CIA sources is they tried with the NFL, they tried with the statues, they tried with Charlottesville.
[02:07:01.355 --> 02:07:06.421]  They've now attacked this crowd of right-wingers to then invoke going after the guns.
[02:07:07.409 --> 02:07:13.213]  Then my sources start telling me this a day ago, and then our investigative journalist, Millie Weaver, gets on the trail.
[02:07:13.213 --> 02:07:21.980]  She has a whole list of notes here she gave me this morning, where it was a weapons sting gone bad, that he was hooked into intelligence agencies.
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:36.151]  We know he worked for Lockheed and the Skunk Works, and then he got set up and double-crossed, and that's why the police are lying about what day he got there two days earlier, as our investigative journalists have gotten into the computers, you know, there and talked to
[02:07:36.311 --> 02:07:38.992]  The sources inside have checked that.
[02:07:38.992 --> 02:07:40.773]  So this is a total information war.
[02:07:40.773 --> 02:07:51.797]  And now in the 30-minute interview, he says 37 times that he acted alone, 27 times no motive.
[02:07:51.797 --> 02:07:53.378]  And he's got an earpiece clearly.
[02:07:53.378 --> 02:07:54.378]  He's going, oh, sorry.
[02:07:54.378 --> 02:07:55.519]  Yeah, OK.
[02:07:55.519 --> 02:07:57.359]  This is the worst acting.
[02:07:57.359 --> 02:08:03.162]  He goes from Monday saying his brother didn't do it and had no guns to he had it, he had guns, he acted alone.
[02:08:04.222 --> 02:08:07.583]  I mean, this is the worst scripting I've ever seen.
[02:08:07.583 --> 02:08:08.983]  The attack's real.
[02:08:08.983 --> 02:08:10.744]  The 59 people dead is real.
[02:08:10.744 --> 02:08:11.844]  That's all real.
[02:08:11.844 --> 02:08:12.804]  I've seen the raw footage.
[02:08:12.804 --> 02:08:14.385]  I talked to first responders.
[02:08:14.385 --> 02:08:15.705]  The media's trying to spin that claim.
[02:08:15.705 --> 02:08:17.345]  We're saying that's total bull.
[02:08:17.345 --> 02:08:19.266]  That's another PSYOP to confuse people.
[02:08:19.266 --> 02:08:21.246]  They called for a revolution in October.
[02:08:21.246 --> 02:08:22.527]  They're trying to trigger it.
[02:08:22.527 --> 02:08:25.907]  They're making their move, hoping to trigger other mass shootings.
[02:08:25.907 --> 02:08:30.208]  That's what Colonel Schaefer has said from his CIA sources days after I first broke in.
[02:08:30.208 --> 02:08:32.029]  I'm only saying the point is we're not making this up.
[02:08:32.509 --> 02:08:33.850]  Shaffer has now said it.
[02:08:33.850 --> 02:08:41.933]  You've got the top psychiatrist that works for the federal government who's examined all this saying it's a Democrat plan to overthrow the government, to have special elections.
[02:08:41.933 --> 02:08:43.033]  He's now getting death threats.
[02:08:43.033 --> 02:08:45.234]  Folks after him is going to stop at that.
[02:08:45.234 --> 02:08:48.316]  The sheriff's come out and said we are looking at radicalization.
[02:08:48.316 --> 02:08:50.897]  So we're going to get you that clip that Laura just talked about.
[02:08:50.897 --> 02:08:51.777]  We're getting it right now.
[02:08:51.777 --> 02:08:53.458]  She just tweeted it at Laura Loomer.
[02:08:54.278 --> 02:09:02.165]  We're going to retweet it at Alex Jones, there on Twitter as well, where he's talking about gun running, gun running, and then gets it wrong.
[02:09:02.165 --> 02:09:05.628]  It's just funny because at the bottom of the hour, that's where I was going.
[02:09:05.628 --> 02:09:10.032]  The big news, I said, would be at the end of the third hour at the start of the show.
[02:09:10.032 --> 02:09:11.133]  Laura didn't even know that.
[02:09:11.753 --> 02:09:15.836]  That that's where we were going, and then there's a raw tape we're playing where he's saying it.
[02:09:15.836 --> 02:09:17.097]  So we're going to go back to that.
[02:09:17.097 --> 02:09:19.658]  As soon as we get the clip, they're going to let me know.
[02:09:19.658 --> 02:09:30.906]  So, Craig Sawyer, former highly decorated Navy SEAL, Marine before that, great patriot, host TV shows, Discovery Channel, History Channel, you name it, top shot.
[02:09:30.906 --> 02:09:33.868]  Craig Sawyer, TacticalInsider.com, VetsForChildRescue.org.
[02:09:36.030 --> 02:09:40.594]  Joining us riding shotgun to give us his approximation of this.
[02:09:40.594 --> 02:09:41.915]  They're saying there's no motive.
[02:09:41.915 --> 02:09:53.285]  The motive is target Christian conservatives, target Trump supporters, and then have the relish of turning around and using it against the Second Amendment and using it against the very victims.
[02:09:53.285 --> 02:09:55.607]  This whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[02:09:55.607 --> 02:09:59.030]  Craig Sawyer is a former SEAL team leader.
[02:09:59.030 --> 02:10:00.812]  What do you make of this whole situation?
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:08.226]  Well, from a federal criminal investigator standpoint, Alex... That's right, you got that as a former current federal officer.
[02:10:08.226 --> 02:10:09.427]  I forgot.
[02:10:09.427 --> 02:10:13.851]  Yeah, now when you consider motive, you look at who benefits.
[02:10:14.565 --> 02:10:16.908]  And that's the first thought that I had.
[02:10:16.908 --> 02:10:18.630]  Certainly the shooter did not benefit.
[02:10:18.630 --> 02:10:21.353]  He didn't know those people that he was shooting up.
[02:10:21.353 --> 02:10:28.861]  And if he took his own life, which I don't believe now, then what benefit was that to him?
[02:10:28.861 --> 02:10:31.484]  He could have just killed himself and left everybody else out of it.
[02:10:31.484 --> 02:10:32.605]  So he didn't benefit.
[02:10:32.605 --> 02:10:33.446]  So who benefits?
[02:10:33.906 --> 02:10:39.851]  Well, I see people that are already preaching what they're after right on his heels.
[02:10:39.851 --> 02:10:44.735]  Hillary Clinton and the others, the gun grabbers, they're the ones that are looking to benefit.
[02:10:44.735 --> 02:10:47.377]  So I would look at them first as far as motive.
[02:10:47.377 --> 02:10:48.498]  Who do they serve?
[02:10:48.498 --> 02:10:50.639]  What agenda are they on?
[02:10:50.639 --> 02:10:51.840]  And you're tracking on it, Alex.
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:55.123]  It's a big global agenda for control over the United States.
[02:10:55.123 --> 02:10:58.926]  We've got to look deeper there to find out why this keeps happening.
[02:10:59.355 --> 02:11:09.497]  And look at who owns the hotel, serious hardcore Antifa, George Soros connected, Muslim extremist care organization that may be listed as a terror group.
[02:11:09.497 --> 02:11:13.378]  I mean, they are heavy fundraisers, heavily involved.
[02:11:13.378 --> 02:11:17.159]  Five days he's in there with all these guns, all these weapons.
[02:11:17.159 --> 02:11:20.060]  Folks are running around in the crowd saying, get out of here, you're about to die.
[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:24.481]  I mean, Craig, this was executed pretty sloppily, but in a place they thought they had protection.
[02:11:25.697 --> 02:11:30.379]  Yeah, you know, tactically it doesn't make any sense for him to have had that many weapons.
[02:11:30.379 --> 02:11:35.922]  If he wanted to do a lot of harm, I could understand him having several weapons in case one failed and a lot of ammunition.
[02:11:35.922 --> 02:11:41.804]  They want to trot out every configuration in front of Congress and ban every single one of them.
[02:11:41.804 --> 02:11:42.265]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:42.265 --> 02:11:45.086]  This was a political hit, Jobs, what it was.
[02:11:45.086 --> 02:11:53.850]  As much as an assault on those precious victims there, this was an assault on our Constitution and it's... I think it's readily apparent
[02:11:54.554 --> 02:11:54.854]  I think
[02:12:11.671 --> 02:12:12.912]  Does this keep happening?
[02:12:12.912 --> 02:12:22.678]  Not the how, because look, crazy people go on mass murder binges with trucks, with bombs, with knives, with chemicals, with poison, with anything that they can get their hands on.
[02:12:22.678 --> 02:12:25.140]  Sure, but it's the season we're in right now.
[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:27.461]  We're in the season of political overthrow.
[02:12:27.461 --> 02:12:30.983]  The Democrats have said they were going to do this starting October 1st.
[02:12:30.983 --> 02:12:36.287]  I was on air Sunday night saying, I'm surprised the mass shooting hasn't started today.
[02:12:39.816 --> 02:12:45.040]  I mean, look at folks like Colonel Schaefer, who has all his big sources.
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:51.464]  He's saying this is basically a Democratic Party-generated operation, just by them calling for the violence.
[02:12:51.464 --> 02:12:53.286]  The target tells you the motive.
[02:12:53.286 --> 02:12:56.328]  The media being ready to go after the Second Amendment.
[02:12:56.328 --> 02:12:59.390]  As you said, Craig, this really smells as politically motivated.
[02:12:59.390 --> 02:13:01.552]  We found the clip that Laura Loomer has tweeted out.
[02:13:01.552 --> 02:13:03.813]  We were retweeting it at Real Alex Jones.
[02:13:04.654 --> 02:13:16.331]  Right now, here he is, the brother of the reported shooter, clearly going off a statement, repeating like a parrot the same thing over and over again, but then he slips up and says this.
[02:13:17.540 --> 02:13:19.281]  You used the phrase, evil genius.
[02:13:19.281 --> 02:13:20.742]  Do you think that he was?
[02:13:20.742 --> 02:13:21.202]  I'm sorry.
[02:13:21.202 --> 02:13:23.143]  I mean, that's the thing I shouldn't have said.
[02:13:23.143 --> 02:13:26.905]  But that's what people are... I mean, that he's this... You know?
[02:13:26.905 --> 02:13:33.368]  But he's a highly intelligent what... I mean, there's absolutely no... And this is the other part that I want to stress with this.
[02:13:33.368 --> 02:13:38.110]  I mean, it doesn't matter that they won't chase people, but people are saying, oh, he must have had help.
[02:13:38.110 --> 02:13:39.651]  Steve had no help.
[02:13:39.651 --> 02:13:41.412]  Steve didn't take help.
[02:13:41.412 --> 02:13:43.473]  It did not take a village for Steve.
[02:13:43.473 --> 02:13:45.374]  Steve was an arm... I'm sorry.
[02:13:47.113 --> 02:13:49.314]  Please don't.
[02:13:49.314 --> 02:13:50.574]  I'm using a colloquial term.
[02:13:50.574 --> 02:13:55.476]  I was about to use a colloquial term that would besmudge one of the armed forces.
[02:13:55.476 --> 02:13:58.678]  Steve was a standalone guy.
[02:13:58.678 --> 02:14:02.899]  That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
[02:14:02.899 --> 02:14:06.241]  If you wanted to hang out with Steve, you hung out with Steve.
[02:14:06.241 --> 02:14:07.921]  This guy's wearing an earpiece for sure.
[02:14:07.921 --> 02:14:12.643]  Craig watching this as also a federal officer and clandestine stuff.
[02:14:12.643 --> 02:14:13.584]  I mean, what do you make of this?
[02:14:13.584 --> 02:14:14.384]  This is just insane.
[02:14:15.253 --> 02:14:20.717]  Yeah, it looks like he caught himself, or somebody caught him in his earpiece saying, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you?
[02:14:20.717 --> 02:14:22.259]  Easy there.
[02:14:22.259 --> 02:14:30.645]  But look, we have to be intelligent enough as a society, as American citizens, to realize what our global enemies want.
[02:14:30.645 --> 02:14:36.210]  They need us divided and disarmed in order to put us under their ultimate control.
[02:14:36.210 --> 02:14:42.435]  They've got a lot of control already, but to finish it off, they need us divided and disarmed, and we must not play into it.
[02:14:44.065 --> 02:14:54.951]  We need to unite, and I would say to people that are kneeling, that are rioting, that are wearing masks, that are attacking innocent families to shut them up, you're unwitting accomplices.
[02:14:54.951 --> 02:14:58.714]  You're helping our enemies by fueling that division.
[02:14:58.714 --> 02:15:05.517]  Well, you've seen how many Democrats, Craig, have openly celebrated, saying, good, they're a bunch of white Trump supporters, they deserve to die.
[02:15:05.517 --> 02:15:07.979]  The vice president of CBS said it.
[02:15:07.979 --> 02:15:10.220]  I've got like six, seven articles today.
[02:15:10.220 --> 02:15:13.042]  Trudeau said it's white supremacy's the problem.
[02:15:14.375 --> 02:15:28.583]  Well, to Joe Biden, I would say, hey, yeah, let's have a conversation, Joe, but let's have a conversation about why your demographic, why your political party voters are the ones committing all the mass murder.
[02:15:28.583 --> 02:15:30.564]  Stay there, Laura Loomer's got a bunch more, too.
[02:15:30.564 --> 02:15:31.544]  Stay with us.
[02:15:31.544 --> 02:15:33.005]  This is an incredible time to be alive.

[02:18:52.211 --> 02:18:54.273]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:18:54.273 --> 02:18:57.155]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:18:57.155 --> 02:18:58.636]  It's made in the USA.
[02:18:58.636 --> 02:18:58.756]  It's
[02:18:58.916 --> 02:18:59.216]  I think?
[02:19:22.338 --> 02:19:34.046]  Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:19:34.046 --> 02:19:37.348]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:19:37.348 --> 02:19:45.254]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Field and fullwarslife.com.
[02:19:45.254 --> 02:19:47.895]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:12.452 --> 02:20:22.236]  Alex Jones here back live broadcasting worldwide and what we know right now is the official story of Las Vegas is as phony as a $3 bill.
[02:20:22.236 --> 02:20:24.336]  They don't want to tell us who really did it.
[02:20:24.336 --> 02:20:29.578]  Our law enforcement sources said they're looking at radicalization because of Antifa and other literature there.
[02:20:29.578 --> 02:20:36.201]  Now the Vegas Sheriff's Department is saying yes, they're going down that path because of some things they found and that it's shocking to them.
[02:20:36.721 --> 02:20:39.042]  We're looking for Trump's statement coming up soon.
[02:20:39.042 --> 02:20:41.362]  Craig Sawyer also is a weapons expert.
[02:20:41.362 --> 02:20:45.043]  I wanted to get his take on, does it sound like one shooter or two shooters?
[02:20:45.043 --> 02:20:46.664]  I know there's echoes and things.
[02:20:46.664 --> 02:20:49.985]  I've talked to some other Green Berets, Special Forces folks.
[02:20:49.985 --> 02:20:53.146]  They say it sounds like multiple shooters to them.
[02:20:53.146 --> 02:20:56.707]  But acoustically, I know it's hard to scientifically pin that down.
[02:20:56.707 --> 02:20:57.487]  Here's some of that audio.
[02:21:39.634 --> 02:21:43.460]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, going back to Craig Sawyer for the rest of this segment.
[02:21:43.460 --> 02:21:47.886]  And Laura Lerner is going to continue with the big breakdown with us with Millie Weaver coming up in the next segment.
[02:21:47.886 --> 02:21:50.490]  Craig, you're a weapons expert.
[02:21:50.490 --> 02:21:52.533]  You hear what's going on with that audio.
[02:21:52.533 --> 02:21:53.514]  Talks to a lot of other experts.
[02:21:53.514 --> 02:21:55.337]  They say they're suspicious about it.
[02:21:55.337 --> 02:21:55.818]  What do you think?
[02:21:57.185 --> 02:21:59.689]  Well, it does sound like multiple shooters, Alex.
[02:21:59.689 --> 02:22:07.500]  But keep in mind, an urban environment, anytime you get contact in an urban environment, it's very, very confusing.
[02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:09.083]  The echo is overwhelming.
[02:22:09.083 --> 02:22:12.388]  You can't necessarily tell which direction it's coming from because of that echo.
[02:22:13.068 --> 02:22:15.809]  And you can't always tell how many shooters there are because of that.
[02:22:15.809 --> 02:22:22.132]  So, it is difficult, it's tricky, but I will say, even with that considered, this does sound like multiple shooters.
[02:22:22.132 --> 02:22:29.835]  The different pitch, the different frequency, and different tempo of a couple of the strings of fire there.
[02:22:29.835 --> 02:22:37.199]  So, one thing to consider, too, is those slide fire mechanisms do allow for a variance in rate of fire.
[02:22:37.199 --> 02:22:39.219]  So, in one of those strings of fire, you hear the
[02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:41.060]  Now,
[02:23:03.937 --> 02:23:21.324]  Adding all this together, we don't know exactly what's going on, but we know they said this time of violence was coming, they're going to overthrow Trump, they're going to get our guns, we know they sent Democrats out to shoot Scalise, CNN celebrated it, I have the video, and said he was not a bad guy, he was upset politically.
[02:23:21.324 --> 02:23:29.427]  So they're trying to encourage this, they admit they are, they have Democrat operatives on TV saying hashtag punt Republicans.
[02:23:29.427 --> 02:23:31.648]  As a top counter-terrorism guy,
[02:23:33.721 --> 02:23:35.082]  What do you think we should do?
[02:23:35.082 --> 02:23:37.242]  What do you think we're up against here?
[02:23:37.242 --> 02:23:39.443]  I mean, clearly they're making their move.
[02:23:39.443 --> 02:23:44.085]  I think all the evidence points towards us being a Democrat deep state operation.
[02:23:44.085 --> 02:23:44.605]  Yeah.
[02:23:44.605 --> 02:23:47.326]  Well, the first thing is we cannot allow them to divide us.
[02:23:47.326 --> 02:23:48.667]  That's what they need.
[02:23:48.667 --> 02:23:54.149]  In order to gain leverage and control over us as a nation, they need to divide us and weaken us.
[02:23:54.149 --> 02:23:57.750]  We need to be intelligent enough and strong enough not to allow that.
[02:23:57.750 --> 02:24:02.512]  That's how we counter this attack against all of us, whether we're Democrat, Republican or any other
[02:24:03.212 --> 02:24:12.165]  The subcategory that they wanted to divide us into, we need to unite now more than ever and stand as one nation.
[02:24:12.165 --> 02:24:14.248]  Realize we are all under attack.
[02:24:14.248 --> 02:24:15.750]  We are all being subverted.
[02:24:16.597 --> 02:24:27.021]  And manipulated for leverage for those who want those global power mongers who want greater, they want complete control over the United States.
[02:24:27.021 --> 02:24:28.682]  And so we've got to recognize that.
[02:24:28.682 --> 02:24:30.183]  So that's how we counter it.
[02:24:30.183 --> 02:24:32.024]  We stand as one.
[02:24:32.024 --> 02:24:42.468]  We all research rather than just feeding off of headlines from the MSM that we already know is hostile to we, the American people, due to who owns them and what their political outlook is.
[02:24:43.365 --> 02:24:44.406]  We've got to unite.
[02:24:44.406 --> 02:24:49.693]  We've got to educate each other and recognize what we're up against and stand against it that way.
[02:24:49.693 --> 02:24:51.775]  They want to disarm us.
[02:24:51.775 --> 02:24:54.618]  That's one thing that we must not allow them to do.
[02:24:54.618 --> 02:24:56.881]  No matter how crazy the rhetoric gets.
[02:24:56.881 --> 02:24:59.825]  Well, you hate children or something because you want to arm your family.
[02:24:59.825 --> 02:24:59.905]  No.
[02:25:00.515 --> 02:25:06.458]  We've got to be wise enough to recognize the rhetoric and that it's hostile and just stand our ground.
[02:25:06.458 --> 02:25:07.579]  Look for real solutions.
[02:25:07.579 --> 02:25:11.361]  If it's just a crazy person, let's look at psychotropics.
[02:25:11.361 --> 02:25:15.663]  Let's look at medical care for the mentally ill.
[02:25:15.663 --> 02:25:22.487]  Let's seek real solutions as to why this happens if it's not just a deep state setup.
[02:25:23.827 --> 02:25:46.516]  If you look at the brother and him 360 or 180 and you look at just all the craziness and our intel that's been proven accurate and Schaefer and the top psychiatrist everybody's saying this points towards deep state operatives a staged event because of how the Democrats have been calling for violence the whole NFL thing they're trying to turn this country upside down and start a civil war.
[02:25:46.516 --> 02:25:47.797]  Yeah.
[02:25:48.832 --> 02:25:55.418]  Anytime you've got cameras that the public doesn't have access to, they're trying to hide multiple players.
[02:25:55.418 --> 02:25:58.941]  I mean, you see that in a... Sure, why would they release the footage of him?
[02:25:58.941 --> 02:26:03.846]  I mean, these are some of the most surveilled... Craig, you're a security expert, you're a federal officer, you do all this stuff.
[02:26:05.187 --> 02:26:08.090]  22 guns, all these weapons, cameras outside the hotel room.
[02:26:08.090 --> 02:26:11.273]  They don't tell the public this, but hotels, not just casinos, have a procedure.
[02:26:11.273 --> 02:26:14.636]  When you first leave your room, when you check in, they go search your stuff.
[02:26:14.636 --> 02:26:20.121]  Especially if you fit a background, a profile, and then they go through everything else.
[02:26:20.121 --> 02:26:24.505]  And then if you've been in your room for a day, they come in whether it says do not disturb or not.
[02:26:24.505 --> 02:26:30.030]  The fact that he's in there for five days with all these weapons and not detected is impossible.
[02:26:30.310 --> 02:26:33.532]  And then you've got the people in the crowd saying, get out of here, you're about to die.
[02:26:33.532 --> 02:26:34.433]  That's confirmed.
[02:26:34.433 --> 02:26:35.713]  What does that sound like, Craig Sawyer?
[02:26:35.713 --> 02:26:39.315]  Yeah, well, that sounds suspicious to me.
[02:26:39.315 --> 02:26:50.002]  Look, again, a lot of the camera footage, anytime something happens that's a false flag, all of the camera surveillance footage gets rounded up by the feds and nobody gets access to it ever.
[02:26:51.002 --> 02:26:54.386]  And no matter how long it seems to go afterwards.
[02:26:54.386 --> 02:26:59.872]  So that to me puts up a couple red flags as making it highly suspicious.
[02:26:59.872 --> 02:27:07.200]  So if it was just a single shooter, they wouldn't have any problem with people reviewing that surveillance footage from around the casino.
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:10.603]  So, man, it feels bad.
[02:27:10.603 --> 02:27:12.485]  Feels bad, Alex.
[02:27:12.485 --> 02:27:12.826]  Pardon me.
[02:27:14.764 --> 02:27:16.187]  I'm the same way here with my cough.
[02:27:16.187 --> 02:27:17.369]  It's all stuff in the air.
[02:27:17.369 --> 02:27:21.136]  Well, Craig, let's talk to you again very, very soon as this unfolds.
[02:27:21.136 --> 02:27:23.319]  Craig Soret, you've got about a minute with final comments.
[02:27:25.327 --> 02:27:33.310]  Yeah, well, again, I think it's just a matter of recognizing the hostility and what the objective is of our enemy.
[02:27:33.310 --> 02:27:36.891]  Our global enemies need us divided and disarmed.
[02:27:36.891 --> 02:27:38.252]  That's what they're after.
[02:27:38.252 --> 02:27:43.054]  And if you understand their objective, you understand why they're doing what they're doing.
[02:27:43.054 --> 02:27:46.015]  And through that, we can best unite to counter it.
[02:27:46.730 --> 02:27:48.191]  And not fall into the division.
[02:27:48.191 --> 02:27:55.414]  Let's not be rioting and kneeling and shouting each other down and wearing masks and mass murdering each other.
[02:27:55.414 --> 02:27:57.454]  We gotta be sharper than that.
[02:27:57.454 --> 02:27:59.235]  We're all in this together, Americans.
[02:27:59.235 --> 02:28:00.556]  We are all in it together.
[02:28:00.556 --> 02:28:04.237]  We're about to lose the rest of our freedom by being foolish.
[02:28:04.237 --> 02:28:07.198]  So I say that's the key, Alex.
[02:28:07.198 --> 02:28:08.339]  Recognize what's going on.
[02:28:08.339 --> 02:28:08.799]  Research.
[02:28:09.568 --> 02:28:16.691]  Network, share with each other what's going on, and look at it as honestly and accurately as possible, and stand as one nation.
[02:28:16.691 --> 02:28:17.271]  That's right.
[02:28:17.271 --> 02:28:18.071]  Thank you, Craig Sawyer.
[02:28:18.071 --> 02:28:21.613]  We'll talk to you, tacticalinsider.com, very, very soon.
[02:28:21.613 --> 02:28:22.253]  Great update.
[02:28:22.253 --> 02:28:24.714]  Okay, Laura Loomer coming up, and in-studio Milly.
[02:28:24.714 --> 02:28:28.575]  We were with a lot of breaking intel, connecting all the dots straight ahead.
[02:28:28.575 --> 02:28:31.176]  I don't want to brag, but people need to know, we are at the cutting edge right now.
[02:28:31.176 --> 02:28:34.377]  We are breaking this wide open.
[02:28:34.377 --> 02:28:37.719]  The globalists aren't in total control anymore, and we are destroying them right now.
[02:28:37.719 --> 02:28:38.139]  Stay with us.
[02:28:41.095 --> 02:28:42.956]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:28:42.956 --> 02:28:44.997]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:28:44.997 --> 02:28:47.898]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:28:47.898 --> 02:28:53.961]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:28:53.961 --> 02:29:03.165]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:29:03.165 --> 02:29:06.427]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[02:29:06.707 --> 02:29:10.691]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:29:10.691 --> 02:29:18.719]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:29:18.719 --> 02:29:19.800]  The general public doesn't.
[02:29:20.894 --> 02:29:24.839]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:29:24.839 --> 02:29:28.403]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:29:28.403 --> 02:29:35.132]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:29:35.132 --> 02:29:39.297]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:29:42.375 --> 02:29:47.100]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:57.312]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases,
[02:29:57.352 --> 02:29:57.532]  I think?
[02:30:16.212 --> 02:30:16.912]  We're good.

[02:31:06.241 --> 02:31:10.903]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.

[02:31:25.207 --> 02:31:31.729]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.

[02:33:03.626 --> 02:33:08.029]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:08.029 --> 02:33:11.351]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:11.351 --> 02:33:15.774]  Alright, Laura Loomer and Millie Weaver.
[02:33:17.142 --> 02:33:21.044]  I've been on parallel tracks researching this.
[02:33:21.044 --> 02:33:28.287]  And I'll be honest, at this point in my 22 years on air, I am now officially beyond a headache.
[02:33:28.287 --> 02:33:29.747]  I know this is real.
[02:33:29.747 --> 02:33:30.908]  I know we're on to them.
[02:33:30.908 --> 02:33:33.109]  We're actually fighting them in live time.
[02:33:33.109 --> 02:33:36.970]  I'm getting direct intel from the FBI hostage rescue team.
[02:33:36.970 --> 02:33:40.292]  We got the direct intel about Hillary and her convulsions and her black
[02:33:42.515 --> 02:34:04.517]  Ambulance and it's just like I can't believe maybe this is like a simulation and it's like I'm plugged in somewhere like in Total Recall where I'm the action invention star that starts the radio network TV thing that battles the globalists and then gets the president in and then we're battling him in real time they've staged a Las Vegas attack and I'm not saying I literally believe that but I I need a vacation
[02:34:05.998 --> 02:34:14.960]  Because I watched all that footage of those poor people gulping for air, bleeding and dying, like fish out of water on top of piles of beer cans, man.
[02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:16.240]  And it just really got to me.
[02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:23.302]  And I've got three daughters and some of those girls are like 16 years old.
[02:34:23.302 --> 02:34:29.483]  They have video of them gulping and dying and their souls leaving their bodies and them just fading away.
[02:34:30.399 --> 02:34:44.492]  And then the whole MO, it's him at the Democrat thing on the video, and the brother's got an earpiece, it's so clear, and the hotel who owns it, and all of it, and the Democrats, and they're just scum!
[02:34:44.492 --> 02:34:53.300]  I mean, the late-night TV people in Hollywood and all of it, it is just like, good lord, and it's all run by a bunch of skexies like...
[02:34:54.212 --> 02:35:07.420]  Nancy Pelosi and that goblin creature, Michael Moore, and they're just all part of a Nazi collaborator who's done this in countless countries, did the same stuff with mass shootings in Ukraine, to say the government did that and overthrow stuff.
[02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:09.061]  I mean, we're here, Millie Weaver, both of you.
[02:35:09.061 --> 02:35:13.804]  I'm going to try to give you both the floor here, because at this point my head is officially actually spinning.
[02:35:14.284 --> 02:35:19.146]  This has only happened a few other times when I get so stressed out I start kind of getting dizzy and then I have like a migraine headache.
[02:35:19.146 --> 02:35:22.708]  So what's happening is I've got a migraine headache coming on literally here on air.
[02:35:22.708 --> 02:35:33.414]  So Millie, introduce the research you've done and then you can co-host here with Laura Loomer to go over this and I'm going to let you ladies host this segment.
[02:35:33.414 --> 02:35:37.155]  There's seven minutes left and ten minutes to the next and I'll be back in about 15 minutes.
[02:35:37.155 --> 02:35:38.136]  It's in full or stay with us.
[02:35:39.403 --> 02:35:46.805]  All right, so some of the things that we first saw with this shooting in Las Vegas is that it was highly unconventional.
[02:35:46.805 --> 02:35:48.066]  It was out of the ordinary.
[02:35:48.066 --> 02:35:51.467]  Everybody was looking at this going, all right, this isn't making sense.
[02:35:51.467 --> 02:35:53.567]  It's reeks of a cover story.
[02:35:53.567 --> 02:35:55.488]  They're not giving us all of the information.
[02:35:55.488 --> 02:35:59.029]  And I know Laura Loomer has put together some amazing information.
[02:35:59.029 --> 02:36:00.729]  She has some awesome sources.
[02:36:00.729 --> 02:36:08.792]  And me and her spent like an hour on the phone last night just kind of hashing it out, trying to figure out what in the world is going on, because I have sources as well.
[02:36:09.372 --> 02:36:11.413]  So I wanted to get your take, Laura.
[02:36:11.413 --> 02:36:13.214]  What are you thinking on this?
[02:36:13.214 --> 02:36:14.535]  Give us some input.
[02:36:39.261 --> 02:37:00.329]  Well yeah, as you mentioned, you and I were discussing this last night and you know there's a lot of things that suggest that either it's some type of a deep state cover-up or you know that Steven Paddock had ties to Islamic terrorists, whether it was a gun running operation gone wrong or in fact he was an ISIS operative himself.
[02:37:02.370 --> 02:37:17.201]  Already, if you look at the $100,000 transaction to the Philippines and the fact that Alex has already mentioned that a lot of those weapons were not purchased, it makes you wonder, how did he obtain those weapons and the explosives that were found in his other properties?
[02:37:17.201 --> 02:37:25.847]  Because $100,000, that can get you, you know, some pretty top-grade weapons, assault rifles, a lot of ammunition, a lot of explosives, and we're not even being told yet.
[02:37:26.948 --> 02:37:33.053]  You know, what they found on his laptop, the other type of ammunition and weapons they found on his other properties.
[02:37:33.053 --> 02:37:35.235]  So, that's gun-running money.
[02:37:35.235 --> 02:37:43.262]  I mean, of course, usually arms dealers are involved in multi-million dollar deals, but $100,000 is enough to buy you the type of weapons that are used.
[02:37:43.262 --> 02:37:48.347]  Exactly, and we know that he was a high-limit gambler, and he has a record of high-limit gambling.
[02:37:48.347 --> 02:37:50.809]  And typically, that's how you wash money.
[02:37:51.349 --> 02:38:04.533]  So if you're going to go ahead and wash through this gun money or weapons money, who better than a former accountant and auditor that worked for the predecessor of Lockheed Martin to do it?
[02:38:04.533 --> 02:38:07.793]  I mean, something's really unusual here.
[02:38:07.793 --> 02:38:10.614]  We also know that Steven Paddock had a pilot's license.
[02:38:10.614 --> 02:38:13.395]  He owned two single-engine airplanes.
[02:38:13.815 --> 02:38:16.636]  So was he potentially flying weapons?
[02:38:16.636 --> 02:38:17.997]  What was this guy's history?
[02:38:17.997 --> 02:38:19.497]  We need to know more about that.
[02:38:19.497 --> 02:38:24.359]  But I also do agree with Laura in the sense that ISIS has claimed responsibility.
[02:38:24.359 --> 02:38:30.081]  They have not been known to claim falsely for an attack that has happened.
[02:38:30.081 --> 02:38:32.362]  And so why would they claim falsely here?
[02:38:32.362 --> 02:38:40.585]  And is it likely that there was a weapons deal that happened between an ISIS group and this person that went awry?
[02:38:40.585 --> 02:38:41.726]  Right.
[02:38:42.580 --> 02:38:48.484]  Yeah, and of course there's a lot of Islamic connections to the Muslim world and Las Vegas.
[02:38:48.484 --> 02:38:59.330]  A lot of people don't know this, but MGM Resorts, which is where this attack took place, Dubai World, which is owned by the Dubai government, used to own half of MGM.
[02:38:59.330 --> 02:39:04.513]  And just recently, they signed their own deal to establish their own MGM Resorts.
[02:39:04.913 --> 02:39:06.013]  In Dubai, right?
[02:39:06.013 --> 02:39:06.954]  So in the Middle East.
[02:39:06.954 --> 02:39:10.034]  So there is a heavy Islamic connection.
[02:39:10.034 --> 02:39:12.955]  The girlfriend is involved in the casino industry as well.
[02:39:12.955 --> 02:39:18.056]  She worked for Atlantis, which is owned by an Iranian, of course.
[02:39:18.056 --> 02:39:27.818]  And so there's multiple connections to people in the Middle East and countries that have been known to have, you know, extreme ties to terrorism.
[02:39:27.818 --> 02:39:31.819]  And if you look at Iran, for example, and the connection with the girlfriend who's now
[02:39:32.239 --> 02:39:36.124]  You know, a prime suspect in this case, it really makes you wonder.
[02:39:36.124 --> 02:39:48.801]  And you know, it would just make so much sense, this is what's coming together in my mind, if this room was wired up with cameras, why would the shooter, why would Steven Paddock go ahead and wire up the room with cameras if he's just gonna go
[02:39:49.161 --> 02:39:51.383]  Do a shooting and then commit suicide.
[02:39:51.383 --> 02:39:57.027]  But it makes sense that it could have been an FBI sting where you have a weapons transfer go down.
[02:39:57.027 --> 02:40:07.216]  Now, we also have found that, yes, this was a large suite and there is some confusion over the windows that were shot and that had holes in them.
[02:40:07.216 --> 02:40:14.562]  But let's show this image here that I found that actually shows that there were two rooms that had the windows
[02:40:16.363 --> 02:40:42.037]  You actually had a hotel suite window over on one side and then you also had another hotel room that had a connecting door and this is pretty amazing to see this image here because Laura Loomer actually was one who told me yesterday that it might have actually been two rooms with a connecting door there so I found that interesting to see that come to fruition and then we also see that there was record of this receipt saying that there were two people that were ordering this meal from that room
[02:40:42.757 --> 02:40:44.681]  So, was there another person here?
[02:40:44.681 --> 02:40:51.274]  Why would he have accessed two different hotel rooms and shot from two different hotel room windows?
[02:40:52.229 --> 02:41:03.617]  Yeah, so as I was posting a lot of this information and sources who work at the Mandalay told me that he had the suite, which he was originally staying in, booked for the 25th.
[02:41:03.617 --> 02:41:08.660]  And then two days later, he added on the connecting room, which was booked in his girlfriend's name.
[02:41:08.660 --> 02:41:11.442]  So the suite that he was staying in was booked in his name.
[02:41:11.442 --> 02:41:16.945]  And then the second room, which is the connector, which is why there's another window that's blown out, that was under his girlfriend's name.
[02:41:16.945 --> 02:41:17.986]  So there are two rooms.
[02:41:18.366 --> 02:41:26.713]  And then the employee at Mandalay, my source, told me that the room service charges were redirected to the other room.
[02:41:26.713 --> 02:41:35.519]  So while he was staying in one room, he had them swap out the direction of where his meals and charges were being
[02:41:37.284 --> 02:41:38.484]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[02:42:03.213 --> 02:42:03.674]  Exactly!
[02:42:03.674 --> 02:42:06.116]  Could this be what we're seeing is that the FBI is trying to cover up
[02:42:18.428 --> 02:42:24.350]  It's a weapons deal gone bad and that's why we're seeing so many holes in this story here.
[02:42:24.350 --> 02:42:26.570]  Well, we'll find out after this break guys.
[02:42:26.570 --> 02:42:33.412]  Stay tuned because we will be right back with Laura Loomer and we will be discussing the mysteries of the Las Vegas shooting.
[02:42:33.412 --> 02:42:35.053]  Stay there, we'll be right back.

[02:43:50.191 --> 02:43:58.594]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:43:58.594 --> 02:44:03.276]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:44:42.267 --> 02:44:42.767]  Not agree.
[02:44:42.767 --> 02:44:44.168]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:44:44.168 --> 02:44:45.528]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:44:45.528 --> 02:44:46.729]  Why is this so good?
[02:44:46.729 --> 02:44:52.031]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:44:52.031 --> 02:45:05.556]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:45:05.556 --> 02:45:06.917]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:45:07.717 --> 02:45:09.358]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:45:09.358 --> 02:45:11.918]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:45:11.918 --> 02:45:13.219]  These are all parasites.
[02:45:13.219 --> 02:45:14.339]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:45:14.339 --> 02:45:15.659]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:45:15.659 --> 02:45:20.161]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:45:20.161 --> 02:45:23.342]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:45:23.342 --> 02:45:26.523]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:45:26.523 --> 02:45:27.563]  It just came back in yesterday.

[02:46:45.121 --> 02:46:47.803]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:01.008 --> 02:47:02.048]  Welcome back!
[02:47:02.048 --> 02:47:11.833]  I am Millie Weaver and we are joined by Laura Loomer who has done an amazing amount of research and investigation into this Las Vegas shooting.
[02:47:11.833 --> 02:47:20.417]  Could it be that Steven Paddock was a lone gunman that was crazed potentially on SRIs and just decided to shoot up a group of people?
[02:47:20.877 --> 02:47:23.779]  Or could there be something more sinister at play?
[02:47:23.779 --> 02:47:32.004]  Could it be that potentially Steven Paddock was involved in a guns or weapons transfer to a terrorist group such as ISIS?
[02:47:32.004 --> 02:47:34.325]  Well, that's what we're trying to get to the bottom of.
[02:47:34.325 --> 02:47:42.610]  Or could it be that Steven Paddock himself joined the radical group ISIS and carried out the attack, potentially with another person involved?
[02:47:42.990 --> 02:47:54.504]  Well, we're here with Laura Loomer and Laura, I really wanted to ask you about your intel on this Muslim woman who apparently was the woman that was at the concert telling people they were going to die.
[02:47:54.504 --> 02:47:55.465]  So what do you know about that?
[02:47:56.621 --> 02:48:14.906]  Okay, so I don't know if a lot of people have seen this video because the mainstream media has been hiding it, but there's a video of a woman who was celebrating her 21st birthday the night of the shooting, and she was interviewed by the local news, and they asked her if she noticed anything weird, and she said that there was a woman who appeared to look Hispanic.
[02:48:15.266 --> 02:48:19.708]  Who came up and started harassing people in the audience and saying, you're all going to die tonight.
[02:48:19.708 --> 02:48:20.668]  You're all going to be dead.
[02:48:20.668 --> 02:48:24.270]  And then she was freaking people out and security took her away.
[02:48:24.270 --> 02:48:26.831]  And then we didn't really hear about what happened to her.
[02:48:26.831 --> 02:48:40.156]  I received intel this morning from a source, uh, that is claiming that, uh, this, uh, this woman has been detained and is in custody by police right now in Las Vegas and that she is Muslim.
[02:48:41.806 --> 02:48:44.368]  Why are the feds being quiet about this?
[02:48:44.368 --> 02:48:45.749]  Well, that's really interesting.
[02:48:45.749 --> 02:48:50.212]  If she is in fact Muslim, that really does implicate ISIS.
[02:48:50.212 --> 02:48:54.154]  And we know that ISIS has already tried to come out and claim responsibility for this.
[02:48:54.154 --> 02:48:58.357]  So how would she have known in advance that this attack was going to happen?
[02:48:58.357 --> 02:48:59.358]  So you have to wonder that.
[02:49:00.342 --> 02:49:27.317]  Of course, and InfoWars just released this great side-by-side video, I believe yesterday or early this morning, that shows similarities between the same incident that took place at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, where a woman said that she noticed this strange Muslim woman who kept fidgeting with a bag and looking towards the back where the explosion was going to happen, and she wasn't really paying attention to the concert, and she got up and left two minutes before the bomb went off, right?
[02:49:27.717 --> 02:49:28.538]  Thank you so much.
[02:49:42.614 --> 02:49:45.376]  Yeah, that would be easy to mistake, definitely.
[02:49:45.376 --> 02:49:51.461]  You could mix that up easily, but I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the discrepancies that we've found out here.
[02:49:51.461 --> 02:50:09.694]  Now, they're reporting that Steven Paddock was wearing gloves when he was laying there dead on the floor, and that kind of really sparked in my mind, why would you be wearing gloves, essentially maybe trying to hide your fingerprints on the guns, on the weapons, if you were just planning to do a suicide
[02:50:10.495 --> 02:50:11.177]  That's what I'm wondering.
[02:50:18.166 --> 02:50:36.073]  I was wondering the same thing, and of course, you know, you and I were talking about this last night, and I thought it was rather suspicious, but then I started talking to my law enforcement sources and people in, you know, the gun industry, and they were telling me that a lot of these weapons that were used to commit this attack, they get very hot.
[02:50:36.073 --> 02:50:38.174]  You know, these automatic weapons.
[02:50:38.174 --> 02:50:47.838]  And so, it is possible that he was using gloves to protect his hands from the heat, because this shooting went on for a while before police or SWAT
[02:50:48.238 --> 02:50:48.758]  Good point.
[02:51:03.422 --> 02:51:04.043]  for watching!
[02:51:19.580 --> 02:51:26.846]  Again, Alex Jones here, literally, not putting that on earlier, but every once in a while I get so much news info, I start getting a migraine headache with these bright lights.
[02:51:26.846 --> 02:51:29.128]  If I could just get out of here for five minutes, I went and took some aspirin.
[02:51:29.128 --> 02:51:36.054]  So, I am back, ladies and gentlemen, but listening to you guys while I was in my office, Laura Loomer and Millie Weaver, breaking all this down.
[02:51:36.054 --> 02:51:39.998]  I'm going to host someone in the next hour with Roger Stone, but ladies and gentlemen,
[02:51:40.925 --> 02:51:49.067]  I've covered 9-11, I've covered Oklahoma City, I have covered a lot of stuff and I watch those videos.
[02:51:50.725 --> 02:51:54.647]  Because I started seeing people saying the shooting was fake and all that.
[02:51:54.647 --> 02:51:57.308]  And oh, they were saying, I bet Alex Jones says it's fake.
[02:51:57.308 --> 02:52:07.091]  No, we said about Sandy Hook, we had debates, playing devil's advocate, walking through, like police investigators do, okay, what if it happened this way or what if it happened that way?
[02:52:07.091 --> 02:52:10.552]  And I've been saying for three plus four years, I believe kids died there, okay?
[02:52:10.552 --> 02:52:13.253]  But I know they staged the babies in the incubators and other events.
[02:52:13.253 --> 02:52:14.334]  The media then lies.
[02:52:15.094 --> 02:52:17.976]  And says that I say, you know, nobody died there.
[02:52:17.976 --> 02:52:25.421]  Once you know the parents, once you know the babies that died, once you have the proof they died in the incubators, then I would say Iraq was real.
[02:52:25.421 --> 02:52:27.182]  But it turned out to be fake.
[02:52:27.182 --> 02:52:30.765]  Once you learn it's real, you have to admit it's real.
[02:52:30.765 --> 02:52:31.425]  And it's the same thing.
[02:52:31.425 --> 02:52:32.386]  We knew this was real.
[02:52:32.386 --> 02:52:33.487]  A giant concert, 23,000 people.
[02:52:35.399 --> 02:52:39.201]  All that happening, the eyewitnesses there, they wouldn't do something like that there.
[02:52:39.201 --> 02:52:43.023]  They'd do it in a contained school if they were going to stage a hoax.
[02:52:43.023 --> 02:52:45.044]  But that's not what I'm saying about Sandy Hook.
[02:52:45.044 --> 02:52:46.425]  We know mass shootings happen.
[02:52:46.425 --> 02:52:51.708]  We also know they use them, in the WikiLeaks that admits this, to take our guns and restrict our lives.
[02:52:51.708 --> 02:52:55.510]  They bring in radical Muslims so they attack us and they can take our freedoms.
[02:52:55.510 --> 02:52:59.572]  So this is this transference into this authoritarian civilization.
[02:52:59.572 --> 02:53:03.455]  And you've got some people out there saying, hey Alex, you know, it's crisis actors.
[02:53:04.495 --> 02:53:07.216]  I've watched people die in car wrecks.
[02:53:07.216 --> 02:53:09.916]  Pulled over and given aid when somebody's head's half chopped off.
[02:53:09.916 --> 02:53:11.057]  I've seen what it looks like.
[02:53:11.057 --> 02:53:13.017]  I've been there when family died.
[02:53:13.017 --> 02:53:14.318]  I've been there when friends died.
[02:53:14.318 --> 02:53:16.338]  I know what real looks like.
[02:53:16.338 --> 02:53:23.080]  I can tell Hillary would do those town halls, and I'd say that was a fake town hall shot in like 35mm, maybe 80mm.
[02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:28.261]  It was so, it was like Scorsese or, you know, Steven Spielberg had made it.
[02:53:28.261 --> 02:53:31.002]  I mean, you know a movie, the production, okay?
[02:53:32.419 --> 02:53:35.501]  I have seen their fake garbage over and over again.
[02:53:35.501 --> 02:53:41.263]  I watched, last night and this morning, probably an hour of it, okay?
[02:53:41.263 --> 02:53:48.267]  Of women with their lives going on, that look like my daughters, with air gulping out and their eyes fading out.
[02:53:48.267 --> 02:53:49.587]  You can't fake that.
[02:53:49.587 --> 02:53:52.168]  Not a thousand Academy Awards can fake that.
[02:53:52.168 --> 02:53:52.989]  It was real.
[02:53:52.989 --> 02:53:57.311]  They wouldn't do it in a big open thing like that with crisis actors and all the rest of the garbage.
[02:53:57.811 --> 02:54:02.794]  And the media always describes to me the crisis actor stuff, and then says in every case I'm saying it's actors.
[02:54:02.794 --> 02:54:12.760]  When the Democrats say we're hiring actors to be Antifa, to help stir stuff up, and it's officially on their site, and the same company was hired for Hillary's fake ads, I say it!
[02:54:12.760 --> 02:54:14.181]  When they say they did it!
[02:54:15.089 --> 02:54:16.690]  This is real!
[02:54:16.690 --> 02:54:19.311]  And it makes you want to punch anybody in the nose that says it isn't!
[02:54:19.311 --> 02:54:22.152]  You've got your First Amendment rights, but this attack was real!
[02:54:22.152 --> 02:54:24.693]  And I'm not going to have the media say I didn't say it was real!
[02:54:24.693 --> 02:54:26.014]  I watched those videos!
[02:54:26.014 --> 02:54:26.814]  That's real!
[02:54:26.814 --> 02:54:29.555]  And I know people that were responding there, they saw it!
[02:54:29.555 --> 02:54:30.076]  It's real!
[02:54:30.076 --> 02:54:30.636]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:54:30.836 --> 02:54:31.897]  Yeah, it's definitely real.
[02:54:31.897 --> 02:54:36.198]  And even the delayed response, people not even recognizing that those were bullets at first.
[02:54:36.198 --> 02:54:40.000]  If they were actors, don't you think they would immediately, on cue, start running around?
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:40.460]  No.
[02:54:40.460 --> 02:54:41.101]  It was real.
[02:54:41.101 --> 02:54:44.382]  The people... Well, the one thing they also use on some of the tapes is, where's the bullet hole?
[02:54:44.382 --> 02:54:45.262]  I can't find it.
[02:54:45.262 --> 02:54:49.704]  I've shot deer, okay, between the eyes, and the bullet doesn't come out.
[02:54:49.704 --> 02:54:53.026]  You can't even find the hole, except maybe one drop of blood that came out.
[02:54:53.026 --> 02:54:54.927]  Another time, it blows the whole side of their head off.
[02:54:55.507 --> 02:54:59.273]  Okay, I've shot elk, I've shot everything, buffalo, you name it, with bows.
[02:54:59.273 --> 02:55:01.456]  I've shot wild hogs, coyotes.
[02:55:01.456 --> 02:55:09.027]  I mean, a lot of times you can't find the bullet hole until you just see the big pool of blood because their heart quit pumping and the blood stopped going out.
[02:55:09.027 --> 02:55:10.349]  Okay, but I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:55:10.689 --> 02:55:24.255]  You know, it's interesting also the fact that the Democrats already had gun legislation in the works to try and go after our gun rights, and then this happens, and it just, it wreaks- They've been saying a revolution's coming!
[02:55:24.255 --> 02:55:26.396]  In October, this is it!
[02:55:26.396 --> 02:55:28.036]  Laura Loomer, what's your gut tell you?
[02:55:28.036 --> 02:55:29.797]  What are your latest sources coming and telling you?
[02:55:30.615 --> 02:55:49.410]  Well, another piece of information that I released yesterday that ties Hillary Clinton to the resort where this attack took place is the CEO, from what I'm being told by employees, was providing through the union 10 weeks of paid leave for employees who wanted to campaign for Hillary Clinton during the election.
[02:55:49.410 --> 02:55:53.694]  Oh yeah, they're hardcore embedded with the whole Soros combine.
[02:55:54.744 --> 02:55:55.966]  So that's very suspicious.
[02:55:55.966 --> 02:56:01.574]  I don't know why, you know, the union for MGM would be giving 10 weeks of paid leave for employees.
[02:56:01.574 --> 02:56:09.165]  Laura, do we know any more through your great investigative journalism with the sources about these Hispanic couple warning people, get out of here.
[02:56:09.165 --> 02:56:09.806]  You're going to be dead.
[02:56:12.085 --> 02:56:22.574]  I've been told that there were two people, but I didn't want to officially report that there were two people because I've only really received strong intel that one female is in custody.
[02:56:22.574 --> 02:56:26.017]  So there is the possibility that there is another individual.
[02:56:26.017 --> 02:56:26.157]  Wow.
[02:56:26.157 --> 02:56:26.637]  That's huge.
[02:56:26.637 --> 02:56:28.859]  You're saying people, because you've always been great reporting.
[02:56:28.859 --> 02:56:31.662]  I mean, you've got great, Laura Limmer is a great investigative journalist.
[02:56:31.662 --> 02:56:34.524]  You're saying you've got sources that they have people in custody we don't know about.
[02:56:35.632 --> 02:56:47.224]  Yeah, I'm being told that there are actually two Muslims in custody, but I didn't want to report the second person because, like I said, I didn't want to, you know, go with something that hasn't been confirmed.
[02:56:47.224 --> 02:56:52.690]  Well, I heard this two days ago that there's massive amounts of Muslims coming in this week, and here it is.
[02:56:52.690 --> 02:56:57.695]  Middle East Air Force books entire hotel tower on Las Vegas Strip.
[02:56:57.695 --> 02:56:58.116]  Exactly.
[02:56:59.312 --> 02:57:09.101]  Yeah, and as I was explaining to Millie while you took a quick break, you know, the Middle Eastern governments are heavily invested in the casino industry in Las Vegas.
[02:57:09.101 --> 02:57:10.042]  Oh, of course, I heard you.
[02:57:10.042 --> 02:57:10.842]  I was in my office listening.
[02:57:10.842 --> 02:57:12.504]  Stay right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:12.504 --> 02:57:15.827]  We're going to come back with more with Laura Loomer, Millie Weaver, and Roger Stone.

[02:57:31.593 --> 02:57:40.617]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information, and in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that
[02:57:40.697 --> 02:57:41.017]  I think?
[02:57:59.406 --> 02:58:09.742]  Concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.

[02:59:43.403 --> 02:59:46.064]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:46.064 --> 02:59:51.206]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:59:52.953 --> 03:00:13.073]  Well, I want to give all of our audience the credit, our affiliates, people that make this broadcast possible to have this platform for the fact that as bad as this is and these terrible crime that's been committed and these poor victims and their families we should pray for and support, America isn't buying the official story because they're not giving us one because they're covering up what happened.
[03:00:14.087 --> 03:00:14.367]  Yeah.
[03:00:14.367 --> 03:00:15.327]  And we know that.
[03:00:15.327 --> 03:00:19.889]  And everything I've been breaking here comes right from good sources and is now being confirmed.
[03:00:19.889 --> 03:00:22.209]  But I have a sick feeling it being confirmed.
[03:00:22.209 --> 03:00:25.330]  I don't like to be proven right about things this evil.
[03:00:25.330 --> 03:00:28.311]  I wish I was wrong, but I'm not the one that's right or wrong.
[03:00:28.311 --> 03:00:30.692]  These are good sources and we're a major news platform.
[03:00:32.028 --> 03:00:35.830]  Top links on drugs that the sheriff's saying they're investigating if he was radicalized.
[03:00:35.830 --> 03:00:37.251]  That means they saw signs of it.
[03:00:37.251 --> 03:00:40.734]  He said, unfortunately, we're having to go on that line because can't believe it.
[03:00:40.734 --> 03:00:41.394]  We got to do it.
[03:00:41.394 --> 03:00:43.996]  He's about to cry, but they've discovered.
[03:00:43.996 --> 03:00:46.697]  And then you've got him on drugs just like we first broke it.
[03:00:46.697 --> 03:00:48.058]  Daniel said Monday.
[03:00:48.058 --> 03:00:53.682]  And we've got the, you know, the hotel receipts thanks to the work of Laura Loomer and others.
[03:00:53.682 --> 03:00:55.203]  Roger Stone's coming up the next segment.
[03:00:55.203 --> 03:00:57.664]  I'll co-host with him a little bit and turn it over to him.
[03:00:57.664 --> 03:00:58.525]  But just finishing up.
[03:00:59.165 --> 03:01:09.468]  This is a time to really be focused and frosty, like I said on Sunday's show and Friday's show, to be armed, to be vigilant, and to be involved in the info war as well, and to be peaceful, never offensive.
[03:01:09.468 --> 03:01:13.489]  But the season of false flags and them blaming us are here.
[03:01:13.489 --> 03:01:18.951]  But it shows you that they can't carry these out very well, and their whole story, the wheels have come off.
[03:01:18.951 --> 03:01:21.792]  And folks, no, I don't just say the wheels have come off unless they have.
[03:01:21.792 --> 03:01:26.333]  So, final comments here, Laura Loomer, and tell folks how they follow your great investigative journalism.
[03:01:27.486 --> 03:01:30.227]  Yeah, you can follow me on Twitter at Laura Loomer.
[03:01:30.227 --> 03:01:33.888]  I'm currently working independently, hoping to do some work with InfoWars.
[03:01:33.888 --> 03:01:37.710]  I definitely want to get you as a contract reporter for us, you know, because I think that gives you more freedom.
[03:01:37.710 --> 03:01:40.871]  But I definitely want to talk to you because you're just doing a great job.
[03:01:40.871 --> 03:01:46.853]  Yeah, so hopefully I'll be doing more special reports and work for InfoWars in the, you know, coming days and future.
[03:01:46.853 --> 03:01:52.575]  But in the meantime, you can follow me on Twitter at Laura Loomer and my Facebook page is at Laura Loomer Official.
[03:01:53.522 --> 03:01:55.363]  All right, well, thank you for your work.
[03:01:55.363 --> 03:01:59.145]  I want to let you get back to your investigative journalism and your tireless energy.
[03:01:59.145 --> 03:02:00.386]  God bless you, Laura.
[03:02:00.386 --> 03:02:01.867]  All of us together.
[03:02:01.867 --> 03:02:02.627]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[03:02:02.627 --> 03:02:02.948]  Thanks, Milly.
[03:02:02.948 --> 03:02:03.668]  Thank you, Laura.
[03:02:03.668 --> 03:02:04.128]  Thank you.
[03:02:04.128 --> 03:02:04.989]  And Milly, thank you.
[03:02:04.989 --> 03:02:10.152]  And it's not about thank you, thank you, thank you, but when something's this big and it's dangerous and
[03:02:10.734 --> 03:02:13.136]  It takes a lot of research and a lot of digging.
[03:02:13.136 --> 03:02:14.798]  Well, this isn't a movie.
[03:02:14.798 --> 03:02:16.079]  This is real life.
[03:02:16.079 --> 03:02:16.880]  It's stressful.
[03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:20.003]  I'm not saying we're as good as the veterans because I love them.
[03:02:20.003 --> 03:02:20.604]  They're great.
[03:02:20.604 --> 03:02:22.726]  But we're serving in the battle for the republic.
[03:02:22.726 --> 03:02:23.887]  This is the big war.
[03:02:23.887 --> 03:02:24.788]  We are in the war.
[03:02:25.313 --> 03:02:26.654]  It's an information war.
[03:02:26.654 --> 03:02:28.876]  It's silent weapons for silent war.
[03:02:28.876 --> 03:02:35.281]  This is how they're going to come after our rights, our freedoms, our gun rights, and that's really what this is all about.
[03:02:35.281 --> 03:02:48.372]  At the end of the day, the Democrats did push the legislation through for this gun control legislation, and this was the perfect catalyst, the perfect situation to create prior to that, to use it as an example as to why we need to
[03:02:48.772 --> 03:02:50.474]  Limit our firearms.
[03:02:50.474 --> 03:02:55.578]  And I'm sorry, but this just reeks so much of some kind of a deep state operation.
[03:02:55.578 --> 03:02:58.440]  And yes, it may be anti-Fuzevolt, maybe ISIS.
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:03:00.562]  I do think it's more likely that ISIS is involved.
[03:03:00.562 --> 03:03:05.626]  But these are tentacles of the same... And she's going back to the Philippines.
[03:03:05.626 --> 03:03:05.826]  Yeah.
[03:03:05.826 --> 03:03:08.048]  And you've had the major ISIS uprisings.
[03:03:08.048 --> 03:03:17.076]  At the end of the day, it's the deep state that's the big octopus who we've already seen colluding with the Democratic Party leaders over spying on Trump's campaign.
[03:03:17.176 --> 03:03:19.457]  Well let's get you back on the war room.
[03:03:19.457 --> 03:03:23.098]  Coming up today with Ellen Schroer and of course Roger Stone will be popping back in on that.
[03:03:23.098 --> 03:03:24.979]  So great job with your investigative journalism.
[03:03:24.979 --> 03:03:25.939]  Millie Weaver.
[03:03:25.939 --> 03:03:27.099]  Thank you very much Alex.
[03:03:27.099 --> 03:03:27.519]  Thank you.
[03:03:27.519 --> 03:03:28.580]  Alright.
[03:03:28.580 --> 03:03:29.200]  Go ahead.
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:34.662]  Well I just wanted to talk a little bit more on Stephen and just say one last thing on him.
[03:03:34.662 --> 03:03:40.744]  He reeks of some kind of a weapons contractor and I'm going to continue getting to the bottom of that and I will be updating.
[03:03:40.744 --> 03:03:42.104]  Oh he's got millions of dollars.
[03:03:42.104 --> 03:03:44.185]  He gets to gamble professionally but never runs out of money.
[03:03:44.525 --> 03:03:45.405]  Yeah.
[03:03:45.405 --> 03:03:45.625]  Yeah.
[03:03:45.625 --> 03:03:46.606]  Where's he getting his money from?
[03:03:46.606 --> 03:03:48.787]  Oh, is he washing it in casinos?
[03:03:48.787 --> 03:03:51.027]  Because that's typically what you do with black market money.
[03:03:51.027 --> 03:03:55.149]  You wash it through casinos, and that would mean that's why he's a high-limit gambler.
[03:03:55.149 --> 03:03:55.849]  Stay right there.
[03:03:55.849 --> 03:04:00.711]  Roger Stone, give us your 60-second or 50-second approximation of what you see happening here.
[03:04:01.331 --> 03:04:02.553]  I'll tell you what I see, Alex.
[03:04:02.553 --> 03:04:07.439]  I see citizen journalism taking control in this country like never before.
[03:04:07.439 --> 03:04:17.230]  People have figured out, the NBCs, the CBSes, the CNNs, that they're full of it, and they have to go to sites like InfoWars to get the cutting-edge truth in this entire matter.
[03:04:17.851 --> 03:04:24.594]  I'll tell you, it's sad but true, because I don't want to get ratings this way, but we have gargantuan traffic to everything.
[03:04:24.594 --> 03:04:30.156]  Millions and millions of new listeners every few hours at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:04:30.156 --> 03:04:30.976]  Stay with us.
[03:04:30.976 --> 03:04:33.117]  Roger Stone straight ahead for the next hour.
[03:04:33.117 --> 03:04:35.258]  Then, The War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:04:35.258 --> 03:04:36.439]  Roger Stone and more.
[03:04:36.439 --> 03:04:36.859]  Stay with us.
[03:04:40.086 --> 03:04:51.151]  A staunch anti-federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution, fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[03:04:51.151 --> 03:04:54.133]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[03:04:54.133 --> 03:05:02.717]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[03:05:02.717 --> 03:05:05.378]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[03:05:05.618 --> 03:05:13.760]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[03:05:13.760 --> 03:05:18.081]  Today, everything the government does, at every level, is concealed from us.
[03:05:18.081 --> 03:05:23.002]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[03:05:23.002 --> 03:05:28.984]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[03:05:29.244 --> 03:05:31.425]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[03:05:31.425 --> 03:05:37.269]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[03:05:37.269 --> 03:05:39.290]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:05:55.495 --> 03:05:58.199]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:05:58.199 --> 03:06:03.325]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:06:17.469 --> 03:06:19.030]  Alex Jones here with Roger Stone.
[03:06:19.030 --> 03:06:23.755]  I'm going to eject out here in about 12 minutes or 10 minutes, but I wanted to finish up with Roger.
[03:06:23.755 --> 03:06:25.856]  Was this a weapons transfer gone bad?
[03:06:25.856 --> 03:06:33.683]  Well, I know from our hostage rescue team sources on Monday morning, just 12 hours after this had taken place, they said, no, he fired back.
[03:06:33.683 --> 03:06:34.324]  We killed him.
[03:06:34.924 --> 03:06:38.747]  You know, we put the photo out that they tried to deny at first, now they admit it's a real photo.
[03:06:38.747 --> 03:06:56.961]  And then, of course, expanding on all of that, on my Twitter, realAlexJones, expanding on all that, our sources said that there was definitely BS going on, was the words used, and that there was a lot of Middle Eastern travel documents and information photos, and that he had women going back and forth.
[03:06:56.961 --> 03:06:59.322]  Not just the girlfriend, but the women and others.
[03:07:00.373 --> 03:07:07.018]  But now we know she had like two husbands going to the Middle East, going to the Philippines with the big Al Qaeda ISIS uprisings.
[03:07:07.018 --> 03:07:14.164]  He had millions and millions of dollars, just gambled all the time, was traveling back and forth in and out of the country, obviously using the casinos to launder the money.
[03:07:14.164 --> 03:07:15.685]  That's what they used those for.
[03:07:15.685 --> 03:07:19.608]  And then the brother gives these testimonies where, oh, he wasn't involved in anything, didn't own any guns.
[03:07:19.608 --> 03:07:20.429]  Oh, he had guns.
[03:07:20.429 --> 03:07:21.270]  He's the mastermind.
[03:07:21.270 --> 03:07:22.711]  He did it all in 48 hour total.
[03:07:24.512 --> 03:07:24.652]  180.
[03:07:24.652 --> 03:07:26.873]  He has like an earpiece in.
[03:07:26.873 --> 03:07:27.873]  He's like, well, what did I say?
[03:07:27.873 --> 03:07:28.913]  Sorry, I didn't get that right.
[03:07:28.913 --> 03:07:30.234]  Okay, I'll get it right this time.
[03:07:30.234 --> 03:07:34.575]  I mean, this is like Loyal and Hardy are running this or something.
[03:07:34.575 --> 03:07:36.456]  So I've never seen anything like this.
[03:07:36.456 --> 03:07:41.357]  All I know is they're trying to blame gun owners when it was Patriots that got targeted.
[03:07:41.357 --> 03:07:42.238]  They're making their move.
[03:07:42.238 --> 03:07:47.439]  The Democrats have said they're going to have a huge uprising in October, November.
[03:07:47.439 --> 03:07:48.099]  It's here.
[03:07:48.099 --> 03:07:50.220]  Roger, we've laid all this out.
[03:07:50.220 --> 03:07:51.521]  We've told folks it's here.
[03:07:51.521 --> 03:07:52.201]  And now I have
[03:07:53.223 --> 03:08:08.490]  Colonel Schaeffer of the CIA high level, and we've got top psychiatrists from, you know, from the federal government that have examined these people, and they're saying clearly he's Antifa, clearly it's the MO to trigger a helter-skelter revolution, clearly the Democrats are saying hashtag hunt Republicans.
[03:08:08.490 --> 03:08:10.571]  They've created the climate.
[03:08:10.571 --> 03:08:16.594]  I mean, this is an incredible time to be alive, where they target patriots and then blame us for it.
[03:08:16.594 --> 03:08:18.075]  Roger, what's your gut tell you?
[03:08:18.075 --> 03:08:19.996]  Because this is just so bombshell.
[03:08:20.902 --> 03:08:34.770]  Well, yesterday, Alex, as you know, on The War Room, we aired a video that we found at YouTube that clearly shows Paddock, the shooter, attending an anti-Trump rally.
[03:08:34.770 --> 03:08:38.112]  A woman refers to him by his first name, Steven.
[03:08:38.112 --> 03:08:43.436]  He answers to it, making it even more obvious that he has a leftist connection.
[03:08:43.436 --> 03:08:45.837]  And if it's not him, it's his twin brother.
[03:08:45.837 --> 03:08:47.898]  I mean, the video is conclusive.
[03:08:47.898 --> 03:08:49.439]  It is him.
[03:08:49.439 --> 03:08:50.280]  Or it's his twin brother.
[03:08:50.840 --> 03:08:53.842]  There's no question about it.
[03:08:53.842 --> 03:09:07.071]  You and I both remember, back in 1963, when the mainstream media came out almost immediately and said, Lee Harvey Oswald, lone nut, communist, came from Russia, and so on.
[03:09:07.071 --> 03:09:08.632]  That became the official narrative.
[03:09:09.352 --> 03:09:10.933]  That won't work anymore.
[03:09:10.933 --> 03:09:13.274]  It's not 1963 anymore.
[03:09:13.274 --> 03:09:20.417]  Now, people can harness the power of InfoWars, the power of the Internet, and a dozen other alternative media outlets.
[03:09:20.417 --> 03:09:20.777]  Well, let's say it.
[03:09:20.777 --> 03:09:22.558]  I mean, it's the autistic keyboard army.
[03:09:22.558 --> 03:09:23.819]  The media says we say that meanly.
[03:09:23.819 --> 03:09:24.279]  No.
[03:09:24.279 --> 03:09:25.620]  They call themselves that.
[03:09:25.620 --> 03:09:27.400]  They'll do it 25 hours a day.
[03:09:27.400 --> 03:09:28.201]  I know there's only 24.
[03:09:28.201 --> 03:09:29.982]  It's a joke for the young Turks.
[03:09:29.982 --> 03:09:31.322]  I don't know how many hours are in a day.
[03:09:31.322 --> 03:09:33.924]  But 25 hours a day is like 110%.
[03:09:33.924 --> 03:09:35.844]  They will go in there and find every piece of data.
[03:09:35.844 --> 03:09:36.765]  You cannot stop them.
[03:09:37.611 --> 03:09:44.213]  No, it's actually exciting in the sense that it's a tragedy of course, this awful loss of life.
[03:09:44.213 --> 03:09:47.334]  But what we're seeing is citizen democracy in action.
[03:09:47.334 --> 03:09:55.637]  We no longer have to buy the BS of the mainstream media who will give us the government sanitized version of what happened in Las Vegas.
[03:09:55.637 --> 03:10:02.139]  We will, collectively we will, get to the bottom of this and we will find out exactly what happened.
[03:10:02.199 --> 03:10:08.307]  That's right, it's an information total revolution, like 1776 but squared to the next level.
[03:10:08.307 --> 03:10:10.650]  It's beautiful, it's incredible, it's unstoppable.
[03:10:11.311 --> 03:10:15.194]  Well, and I think you put it right in the opening here.
[03:10:15.194 --> 03:10:21.159]  This is beginning to smell more and more like some kind of gun running operation.
[03:10:21.159 --> 03:10:27.604]  Isn't it odd that this fellow has no history whatsoever of any social media contact?
[03:10:27.604 --> 03:10:34.129]  That would be typical of a government agent, an FBI agent for example, or a DEA agent.
[03:10:34.129 --> 03:10:36.912]  That he has no record as a gun enthusiast.
[03:10:37.392 --> 03:10:52.159]  Yet he has a veritable arsenal in his room, an arsenal no one saw him bring in, and no one saw him bring ammunition or any of the other necessary pieces, the elaborate filming apparatus and so on.
[03:10:52.159 --> 03:10:54.200]  How very strange.
[03:10:54.200 --> 03:11:02.844]  And then we track him undeniably to an anti-Trump rally, actually two different anti-Trump rallies, two different events.
[03:11:02.844 --> 03:11:03.785]  I think that that's a pattern.
[03:11:03.785 --> 03:11:06.426]  This is like Lee Harvey Oswald at the communist rallies.
[03:11:07.622 --> 03:11:08.722]  Well, very well.
[03:11:08.722 --> 03:11:10.823]  He could have been put there as a plant.
[03:11:10.823 --> 03:11:11.983]  That's entirely possible.
[03:11:11.983 --> 03:11:16.285]  Oh, he worked at Lockheed, and it looks like Skunk Works, Connected Areas, and NASA?
[03:11:16.285 --> 03:11:17.805]  I mean, this is classic!
[03:11:17.805 --> 03:11:19.025]  Lee Harvey Oswald!
[03:11:19.025 --> 03:11:24.087]  Lee Harvey Oswald worked at the U2, uh, proto-Skunk Works.
[03:11:24.807 --> 03:11:29.029]  Well, and as you know, they told us in the Warren Commission he was a known communist.
[03:11:29.029 --> 03:11:32.792]  Then why was he handing out anti-communist literature in New Orleans?
[03:11:32.792 --> 03:11:39.355]  Going out of his way to get in a scuffle, arrested, taken to the New Orleans police station, he's allowed one phone call.
[03:11:39.355 --> 03:11:40.236]  Does he call his lawyer?
[03:11:40.236 --> 03:11:41.637]  Does he call his wife?
[03:11:41.637 --> 03:11:45.159]  No, he calls the head of the FBI and in 30 minutes he's sprung with no charges.
[03:11:45.819 --> 03:11:47.419]  Hmm, how curious.
[03:11:47.419 --> 03:11:52.060]  It's all in the man who killed Kennedy, the case against LBJ.
[03:11:52.060 --> 03:11:55.301]  But I do see these strange parallels, Alex.
[03:11:55.301 --> 03:12:08.104]  The difference is, now you have a crusading, independent, alternative journalistic tradition in this country that's taken root through the internet, and they're not going to be able to pull the wool over our eyes.
[03:12:08.104 --> 03:12:14.145]  We're going to get to the bottom of this, and I don't even think we've begun in terms of ferreting out the facts.
[03:12:14.145 --> 03:12:14.625]  I salute
[03:12:15.365 --> 03:12:22.630]  Laura Loomer, I like to call her Little Laura Loomer because Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin are so deathly afraid of her.
[03:12:22.630 --> 03:12:23.611]  There's a woman I like.
[03:12:24.841 --> 03:12:25.642]  Absolutely.
[03:12:25.642 --> 03:12:29.646]  And I gotta say, I love you triggering them with the matching American flag behind you.
[03:12:29.646 --> 03:12:33.869]  For radio listeners, people can watch it at Infowars.com, Ford's last show, or many other places.
[03:12:33.869 --> 03:12:36.952]  But man, I gotta tell you, people say, why all the American flags?
[03:12:36.952 --> 03:12:38.374]  You only had them sometimes.
[03:12:38.374 --> 03:12:45.820]  Well, now that they're so triggered and want it banned and call it evil, now, oh glory, you know stronger than ever, because we've retaken the country to a great extent.
[03:12:45.820 --> 03:12:49.764]  It's our flag again, and we're flying that sucker in everybody's face.
[03:12:49.764 --> 03:12:50.445]  So get used to it.
[03:12:50.965 --> 03:13:02.000]  It is so offensive to see what's happening in the NFL and to see the people who are trying to tear down the great traditions and the democratic milestones of this country.
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:04.404]  No, America's not perfect.
[03:13:04.404 --> 03:13:07.208]  But we've come a long way and we're a great country.
[03:13:07.668 --> 03:13:10.650]  Well, particularly in the area of racial injustice.
[03:13:10.650 --> 03:13:18.815]  I mean, look, Abraham Lincoln, Dr. King, Malcolm X, these men died to outlaw discrimination.
[03:13:18.815 --> 03:13:21.877]  And now folks are acting like they didn't get anything done!
[03:13:21.877 --> 03:13:23.178]  They act like nothing's happened.
[03:13:23.178 --> 03:13:24.299]  No, America's not perfect.
[03:13:24.299 --> 03:13:28.081]  Yes, we still have racial discrimination, but at least today it's illegal.
[03:13:28.081 --> 03:13:30.463]  At least today it can be pursued in the courts.
[03:13:30.463 --> 03:13:35.506]  At least it is the law of the land, and great men like Dr. King are responsible for that.
[03:13:35.606 --> 03:13:35.986]  That's right.
[03:13:35.986 --> 03:13:37.789]  Roger Stone's taking over here in two minutes.
[03:13:37.789 --> 03:13:51.084]  I just want folks to know that his favorite nootropic, that's Brain Pill, Brain Booster, Secret 12, is also going to be ending its sale today at 40% off, but we have the Brain Force Plus now at 20% more.
[03:13:53.910 --> 03:13:55.251]  It's 50% off.
[03:13:55.251 --> 03:13:57.432]  We've never gone with that big of a sale.
[03:13:57.432 --> 03:13:58.313]  Not because it's not selling.
[03:13:58.313 --> 03:13:59.614]  It's sold out for months.
[03:13:59.614 --> 03:14:00.775]  I said double the shipment.
[03:14:00.775 --> 03:14:05.958]  I want a humongous shipment so I can really discount this baby.
[03:14:05.958 --> 03:14:08.960]  And you know, don't worry, we still make like $5 or so, $6.
[03:14:08.960 --> 03:14:11.942]  But at this price, it really is me like a drug pusher.
[03:14:12.862 --> 03:14:14.343]  Trying to get you addicted.
[03:14:14.343 --> 03:14:16.705]  I'm being facetious, but there's always some truth to a joke.
[03:14:16.705 --> 03:14:17.826]  At least 5% of it.
[03:14:17.826 --> 03:14:20.327]  I mean, it's healthy, it's good, it's great.
[03:14:20.327 --> 03:14:21.028]  I want you to try it.
[03:14:21.028 --> 03:14:22.789]  Just like our coffee is addictive and great.
[03:14:22.789 --> 03:14:23.870]  I want you to try that as well.
[03:14:23.870 --> 03:14:24.770]  It's discounted right now.
[03:14:24.770 --> 03:14:25.531]  50% off.
[03:14:25.531 --> 03:14:26.612]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:14:26.612 --> 03:14:28.753]  BrainForce can run for another week.
[03:14:34.617 --> 03:14:41.483]  But Vitamin Mineral Fusion, we've never gone 50% off on it, with the amino acids, total absorption, it's so great.
[03:14:41.483 --> 03:14:44.906]  That is going to have to stop today, because it'll be months until we get more.
[03:14:44.906 --> 03:14:46.767]  If I don't, this is going to sell out.
[03:14:46.767 --> 03:14:51.231]  So a bunch of these specials, Caveman, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Secret 12.
[03:14:52.432 --> 03:14:55.493]  They're all either ending today or in the next three days.
[03:14:55.493 --> 03:14:58.553]  By that, Vitamin Mineral Fusion's gone today at 3% off.
[03:14:58.553 --> 03:15:00.574]  And then it's gonna be the others in the next few days.
[03:15:00.574 --> 03:15:02.454]  We haven't done the math, the numbers yet.
[03:15:02.454 --> 03:15:07.355]  But again, InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.

[03:17:48.711 --> 03:17:49.251]  That's right.
[03:17:49.251 --> 03:17:54.514]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.
[03:17:54.514 --> 03:18:00.938]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[03:18:01.178 --> 03:18:08.760]  And let me tell you, son, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[03:18:08.760 --> 03:18:09.020]  Woo!
[03:18:09.020 --> 03:18:10.040]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:18:10.040 --> 03:18:18.783]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[03:18:18.783 --> 03:18:26.885]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[03:18:41.235 --> 03:18:44.999]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:18:44.999 --> 03:18:52.746]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:18:52.746 --> 03:19:01.374]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:19:01.374 --> 03:19:05.378]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:19:05.758 --> 03:19:15.605]  There are pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:19:15.605 --> 03:19:19.008]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:19:19.008 --> 03:19:30.056]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:19:30.196 --> 03:19:33.040]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[03:19:33.040 --> 03:19:36.143]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[03:19:36.143 --> 03:19:42.531]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[03:19:42.531 --> 03:19:45.134]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:54.617 --> 03:19:58.979]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:19:58.979 --> 03:20:03.482]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:20:03.482 --> 03:20:09.244]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:20:09.244 --> 03:20:09.865]  Welcome back.
[03:20:10.973 --> 03:20:13.054]  To the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.054 --> 03:20:14.675]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:20:14.675 --> 03:20:17.257]  Here's some breaking news.
[03:20:17.257 --> 03:20:36.709]  A group of Republicans in New York's 18th Congressional District have approached the singer-celebrity Joy Villa about being the Republican candidate for Congress to oppose Democratic Congressman Sean Maloney in that district.
[03:20:37.469 --> 03:20:51.255]  Via is of course a native New Yorker and evidently a number of her admirers are imploring her to return to her home state and seek that congressional seat.
[03:20:51.255 --> 03:21:04.341]  No word yet whether Via is interested or whether she's going to consider it, but having met her recently in Las Vegas at a conservative political action conference, I can tell you she is one
[03:21:05.881 --> 03:21:17.852]  Impressive, articulate, beautiful, conservative woman, and she'd make a heck of a candidate, so I'm hoping, just on a personal level, that she makes the race.
[03:21:17.852 --> 03:21:27.121]  Now, Sean Maloney is a very smart, capable guy, very articulate advocate for his own liberal point of view.
[03:21:27.121 --> 03:21:29.884]  It would be a classic, classic race.
[03:21:31.411 --> 03:21:55.797]  While the entire world remains focused on Las Vegas, confusion after the Terror Act there, not even three full days have passed since this revolting attack in Las Vegas, and the story inconsistencies and the number of conspiracy theories that are sprouting, like mushrooms on decayed wood, are really quite extraordinary.
[03:21:57.177 --> 03:22:22.491]  Word comes from the LA Times that Steven Paddock was a regular at the Virgin River Casino Starbucks in Mesquite, Nevada, that he gambled very large sums, very strange for a man who we're told was a retired accountant with no activity of either gun enthusiasm or political activity.
[03:22:22.491 --> 03:22:25.533]  He was seen there many times with his companion
[03:22:26.253 --> 03:22:40.284]  A Filipino woman named Mary Lou Danley, and one barista told the LA Times that he often saw Paddock abusing Danley.
[03:22:40.284 --> 03:22:46.869]  He was nasty, mean to her, quoting things like, I'm paying for your drink just like I'm paying for you.
[03:22:47.895 --> 03:22:54.160]  But then, unabashedly, Danley would step down and say, okay.
[03:22:54.160 --> 03:23:06.849]  So, looking at Paddock's own words, albeit hearsay, via a Starbucks barista, he was paying for Mary Lou Danley, like paying for a cup of coffee.
[03:23:06.849 --> 03:23:13.013]  And it is, I think, gives us some insights into his psyche.
[03:23:13.013 --> 03:23:16.676]  Taking at face value, we know that he doesn't like to be alone.
[03:23:17.336 --> 03:23:28.701]  We know the service he pays for are not real, and more so, having a paid companion prohibits ability to find any truly meaningful relationship, but I doubt the man cares.
[03:23:28.701 --> 03:23:32.023]  Now, is this all psychobabble?
[03:23:32.023 --> 03:23:33.463]  Yes, to a certain extent.
[03:23:33.463 --> 03:23:34.884]  We are all guessing.
[03:23:35.444 --> 03:23:39.848]  But there's an army of citizen journalists out there, and the digging has begun.
[03:23:39.848 --> 03:24:00.727]  And we've already begun to find holes in the seemingly inconsistent and most definitely incomplete official narrative as to what really happened here, who Steven Paddock really is, whether he is in fact the shooter, whether he is in fact the only shooter.
[03:24:01.508 --> 03:24:18.681]  Since you have different shooting stations, some of those with much greater gun experience than I have, have questioned his ability to move quickly enough between stations, given the weight and mobility of the weapons he was using.
[03:24:20.582 --> 03:24:31.715]  Laura Loomer, I think, was among those who pointed out that we have evidence of a woman, a second guest, in Paddock's room, room 32135.
[03:24:35.259 --> 03:24:45.384]  But we still have no official explanation of who this woman was, whether she was potentially a prostitute or a confederate.
[03:24:45.384 --> 03:24:48.586]  And then there is the double order of the receipt.
[03:24:48.586 --> 03:24:51.348]  Now, the FBI insists
[03:24:52.503 --> 03:24:58.648]  That Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Resort on September 28th, 2017.
[03:24:58.648 --> 03:25:04.753]  You can see this repeated over and over and over again by the mainstream media.
[03:25:04.753 --> 03:25:08.936]  New York Magazine only a couple hours ago repeating that date.
[03:25:08.936 --> 03:25:16.322]  Yet if we look at the actual receipt from the Mandalay Bay Hotel, we see that it's actually dated September 27th, 2017.
[03:25:20.151 --> 03:25:24.373]  Now this is gasoline for the conspiracy fire.
[03:25:24.373 --> 03:25:36.017]  This is what leads people to jump to a broad distrust of both the mainstream media and the federal and state governments who feed us this nonsense.
[03:25:36.017 --> 03:25:42.440]  Why would the authorities mislead the public about something so simple as his check-in date?
[03:25:42.440 --> 03:25:47.802]  And if they're misleading us about this, what else are they misleading us about?
[03:25:48.823 --> 03:25:59.852]  Now, from the dark recesses of the internet comes even more unvetted connections, but some of these leads are so incredible, I have to share.
[03:25:59.852 --> 03:26:05.976]  It kind of starts with the disgraced California state senator, an ex-state senator named Leland Yee.
[03:26:05.976 --> 03:26:16.304]  Yee was arrested and convicted to a five-year sentence for accepting bribes and trafficking arms through, yes, you guessed it, the Philippines.
[03:26:17.565 --> 03:26:36.829]  With more than twenty firearms found in Paddock's rooms, it seems that there may have been some effort that ties the Philippines, the girlfriend, to a gun running operation akin to Fast and Furious.
[03:26:36.829 --> 03:26:39.390]  We are looking into this.
[03:26:40.950 --> 03:27:00.475]  37, 137 page affidavit which was the results of a five-year investigation on Leland Yee which was made public by the FBI soon after his arrest revealed the senator was allegedly proactive in dealing arms through the Philippines through Muslim groups there.
[03:27:01.175 --> 03:27:12.284]  Whether we can establish any tie to Steven Paddock remains to be seen, but we at InfoWars are working assiduously on this story.
[03:27:12.284 --> 03:27:13.585]  The reason that I bring this up...
[03:27:14.565 --> 03:27:25.651]  ...is to clearly state that the FBI is still known to track and attempt international buyers and sellers of guns, particularly to drug lords and terrorists.
[03:27:25.651 --> 03:27:32.015]  The fast and furious gun-walking scandal was the result of just one such effort going all the way back to 2009.
[03:27:34.076 --> 03:27:38.019]  Leland Lee is a more current example, 2016.
[03:27:38.019 --> 03:27:51.590]  There can be little doubt that such activity still is going on, yet we come to an impasse when it comes to getting any answers about Steven Paddock.
[03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:55.213]  We are going to be staying on top of this.
[03:27:55.213 --> 03:27:58.955]  We don't know whether some kind of deal was going down at Mandalay Bay.
[03:27:59.936 --> 03:28:03.858]  We don't know whether the Feds know more about this than they are telling us.
[03:28:03.858 --> 03:28:11.163]  We know we're not getting the straight story because of so many holes in the official version so far.
[03:28:11.163 --> 03:28:17.466]  Many people who were on the terrible site that night say that they personally witnessed multiple shooters.
[03:28:17.466 --> 03:28:22.869]  And therein lies a deep problem with the official narrative.
[03:28:22.869 --> 03:28:24.150]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:28:24.150 --> 03:28:25.951]  You're here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:25.951 --> 03:28:27.212]  And I'll be right back.

[03:29:17.273 --> 03:29:27.539]  Prostagard is something that the men on the InfoWars crew take every day, and from our research, it's something that men should really be adding to their daily regimen in order to keep their body going at optimal levels.
[03:29:28.020 --> 03:29:31.466]  Now's the time to start naturally supporting your body.

[03:30:39.978 --> 03:30:44.620]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.
[03:30:44.620 --> 03:30:52.264]  InfoWars Life brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.
[03:30:52.264 --> 03:30:56.506]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[03:30:56.506 --> 03:31:00.588]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with a super blue fluoride free mouthwash
[03:31:00.808 --> 03:31:02.629]  And supercharge your oral health.
[03:31:02.629 --> 03:31:09.233]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[03:31:09.233 --> 03:31:19.360]  Instead of containing fluoride, our super blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand selected for their oral health benefits.
[03:31:19.600 --> 03:31:26.402]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[03:31:26.402 --> 03:31:29.263]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[03:31:29.263 --> 03:31:32.884]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[03:31:32.884 --> 03:31:37.865]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:37.865 --> 03:31:39.786]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:40.126 --> 03:31:42.008]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:31:42.008 --> 03:31:44.029]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:31:44.029 --> 03:31:46.932]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:31:46.932 --> 03:31:53.017]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:53.017 --> 03:32:02.205]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:32:02.205 --> 03:32:05.488]  Whether it's your home or office, it's yourself, your co-workers,
[03:32:05.728 --> 03:32:09.713]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:32:09.713 --> 03:32:17.762]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:32:17.762 --> 03:32:18.744]  The general public doesn't.
[03:32:19.927 --> 03:32:23.868]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:32:23.868 --> 03:32:27.429]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:32:27.429 --> 03:32:34.151]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:32:34.151 --> 03:32:43.094]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[03:32:43.094 --> 03:32:45.695]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:02.538 --> 03:33:13.384]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:13.384 --> 03:33:14.044]  Welcome back.
[03:33:15.496 --> 03:33:22.965]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones, and you're on the Alex Jones Show here at InfoWars.
[03:33:22.965 --> 03:33:32.937]  As the Robert Mueller investigation testifies, new details are coming out every day about that direction of that very controversial probe.
[03:33:33.718 --> 03:33:55.043]  But buried in the story may be some intense legal problems with the warrant that was laid on Paul Manafort when his apartment was raided at five o'clock in the morning by the FBI at the behest of Special Counselor Mueller.
[03:33:55.783 --> 03:34:04.812]  It seems that Mueller's team obtained evidence not on the listed warrant as required by law.
[03:34:04.812 --> 03:34:06.974]  And in fact, in the July 26th raid,
[03:34:10.397 --> 03:34:17.802]  The FBI may have removed materials covered by the attorney-client privilege.
[03:34:17.802 --> 03:34:24.766]  That could, in fact, taint the entire taking of evidence during the raid.
[03:34:27.547 --> 03:34:38.476]  Numerous precedents of judges very recently saying that two sweeping a warrant violates the Fourth Amendment.
[03:34:38.476 --> 03:34:52.647]  So in other words, Robert Mueller's bully boy tactics, which were orchestrated by investigator Adam Weissman, may now backfire on his inquiry in to the president.
[03:34:53.788 --> 03:35:08.652]  The other major development that I think bears attention was a little-known comment by General John Kelly in the Washington Post only this past week.
[03:35:08.652 --> 03:35:16.754]  Kelly said that all policy initiatives now would go to White House aide Mark Short.
[03:35:17.694 --> 03:35:31.004]  Now, Mark Short, formerly worked for the Koch brothers, comes out of the Americans for Prosperity non-profit organization funded by the Kochs.
[03:35:31.004 --> 03:35:45.715]  The Kochs, you'll remember, are no particular fans of Donald J. Trump, and they opposed his nomination as the Republican nominee for president, essentially until the bitter end.
[03:35:46.721 --> 03:35:56.754]  What's interesting, of course, is that Stephen Miller is the individual who still holds the title of Director of Policy and Planning.
[03:35:56.754 --> 03:36:02.281]  And under the White House flowchart, all policy is supposed to flow to Miller.
[03:36:03.803 --> 03:36:29.372]  So, was General Kelly giving us the early heads up that Stephen Miller, the last remaining Trump campaign veteran, the man whose eloquence and whose writing talents so incredibly punched up the President's superb address at the United Nations only weeks ago, is Miller himself, the last standing Trumpite
[03:36:30.032 --> 03:36:35.558]  Inside the Trump White House, not long for this world.
[03:36:35.558 --> 03:36:48.673]  That would be after the departure of Stephen K. Bannon, after the downgrading of Peter Navarro, the president's special trade representative.
[03:36:49.814 --> 03:37:05.604]  And we have to wonder whether Miller, who we refer to as the Minister of Propaganda, and we say that affectionately, is long for this world, or whether there is some lateral transfer in mind for Mr. Miller.
[03:37:06.565 --> 03:37:18.836]  We here at InfoWars are fans of Stephen Miller because of his ability to handle the mainstream media in a most efficient manner.
[03:37:18.836 --> 03:37:25.942]  If you've ever seen this guy stand up in a press scrum, he is nothing short of brilliant.
[03:37:25.942 --> 03:37:29.325]  But more importantly, he completely understands the President's mind.
[03:37:30.086 --> 03:37:37.149]  He's completely copacetic with the president when it comes to the agenda for reform in this country.
[03:37:37.149 --> 03:37:43.491]  He is the last remaining true loyal Trumpite in the building.
[03:37:43.491 --> 03:37:45.492]  It will be a tremendous tragedy.
[03:37:46.312 --> 03:38:11.917]  If General Kelly, who is succeeding, based on all reports, in bringing down an iron curtain around the President, cutting him off from long-time associates, political supporters, campaign staff, and yes, in some instances, cutting him off from his very own family, it will be a tragedy if Mr. Miller joins the ranks of those who've been squeezed out
[03:38:12.677 --> 03:38:13.078]  Of course.
[03:38:28.857 --> 03:38:46.864]  Which I have found to be, without any question, the best multi-vitamin and mineral formula out there, B12 specifically, is probably 40% off, probably the greatest sale ever on this product.
[03:38:46.864 --> 03:38:50.085]  Now, B12 is absolutely necessary for
[03:38:53.286 --> 03:38:56.329]  Cultivating the energy, if you will.
[03:38:56.329 --> 03:39:16.566]  It's in my daily regimen and I have looked at the labels of the B12 supplements you can buy at the local Walgreens or CVS and I can tell you that Alex Jones and the folks at InfoWars put nothing at the InfoWars.com site that isn't the very best of the best.
[03:39:16.566 --> 03:39:19.988]  It doesn't have not only the best natural ingredients,
[03:39:20.649 --> 03:39:28.446]  But is tested and retested and in many cases have thousands of testimonials from satisfied customers.
[03:39:29.417 --> 03:39:42.902]  This is what Alex Jones calls a 360 degree win, because you get not only good, effective, efficient products at a good price, but you're propping up our war against censorship.
[03:39:42.902 --> 03:39:49.364]  You're backing us in the fight against the mainstream media, who, if they had their way, would snuff us.
[03:39:49.364 --> 03:39:57.807]  The tech left, the Yahoos, the Amazons, the Googles, who would try to censor us if they could.
[03:39:58.427 --> 03:40:06.754]  You see, we don't have a George Soros standing backstage writing multi-million dollar checks.
[03:40:06.754 --> 03:40:12.378]  We can't count on the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, no.
[03:40:12.378 --> 03:40:22.506]  We raise the money through products like Caveman, which right now is available in both the chocolate and strawberry formulas at 50% off.
[03:40:24.187 --> 03:40:26.709]  That's 50% off of retail, folks.
[03:40:26.709 --> 03:40:31.092]  You may never see a sale this great again at the Infowars.com store.
[03:40:31.092 --> 03:40:49.104]  Now, Caveman fuses ancient, powerful nutrition with cutting-edge nutraceutical science to create a high-quality supplement that uses bone broth and more than seven different primal superfoods to give you power and strength like you've never felt before.
[03:40:49.884 --> 03:41:03.615]  Very good friend of mine, Adam Powers, professional bodybuilder, swears by Caveman, would not be without it as part of his regimen, and he's preparing to compete shortly.
[03:41:03.615 --> 03:41:08.699]  Asked me to get him some more Caveman because it was running low, and I pointed out that it was 50%
[03:41:10.100 --> 03:41:12.741]  Off of retail only today.
[03:41:12.741 --> 03:41:30.230]  So a salute to Adam Powers, who's heading for a bodybuilding competition, and a recommendation to you again that you secure your supply of Caveman at 50% off retail before it sells out once and for all.
[03:41:30.230 --> 03:41:35.353]  There have been, this product is so popular, there have been some delays.
[03:41:35.353 --> 03:41:38.054]  So I urge you, act now at 50% off
[03:41:40.091 --> 03:41:45.135]  I know that Michael Zimmerman particularly likes the bone broth aspect of this.
[03:41:45.135 --> 03:41:49.778]  He was talking about it in Washington only a week ago.
[03:41:49.778 --> 03:41:52.099]  Yes, you are on InfoWars.
[03:41:52.099 --> 03:41:55.982]  I'm Roger Stone and I've been sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:41:55.982 --> 03:41:57.043]  If you want to follow...
[03:41:57.623 --> 03:42:00.184]  The very latest out of Las Vegas.
[03:42:00.184 --> 03:42:17.071]  If you're tired of the filter of CNN and the mainstream media and those who would tell you what they'd like you to believe happened as opposed to those here who will tell you what we know, well then stay tuned to InfoWars and you can get the Stone Cold truth.
[03:42:17.071 --> 03:42:19.212]  I'm Roger Stone and I'll be right back.
[03:42:38.852 --> 03:42:45.450]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[03:42:45.450 --> 03:42:47.175]  You're a white male!
[03:42:52.157 --> 03:42:57.919]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in InfoWars live broadcasting.
[03:42:57.919 --> 03:43:00.479]  We are live weekdays from 3 to 6 p.m.

[03:43:16.424 --> 03:43:21.586]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly, as well as taking your phone calls.
[03:43:21.586 --> 03:43:25.187]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[03:43:25.187 --> 03:43:28.088]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[03:43:28.088 --> 03:43:29.368]  This is The War Room.
[03:43:39.068 --> 03:43:47.336]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[03:43:47.336 --> 03:43:48.558]  A 360 win.
[03:43:48.558 --> 03:43:55.124]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[03:43:55.124 --> 03:44:02.652]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[03:44:03.052 --> 03:44:08.113]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:44:08.113 --> 03:44:14.215]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[03:44:14.215 --> 03:44:22.017]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:44:22.017 --> 03:44:28.519]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[03:44:28.519 --> 03:44:30.019]  10% off on AutoShip.
[03:44:30.199 --> 03:44:32.622]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:44:32.622 --> 03:44:34.604]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[03:44:34.604 --> 03:44:38.469]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[03:44:39.733 --> 03:44:48.822]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:44:48.822 --> 03:44:57.230]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:44:57.230 --> 03:45:01.894]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:45:02.094 --> 03:45:08.897]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:45:08.897 --> 03:45:16.061]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:45:16.061 --> 03:45:23.104]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:45:23.104 --> 03:45:27.566]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:45:27.566 --> 03:45:30.788]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:45:30.948 --> 03:45:37.250]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:45:37.250 --> 03:45:39.851]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:45:39.851 --> 03:45:46.113]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.
[03:45:46.113 --> 03:45:50.474]  This powerful combo is perfect for supporting your thyroid and health.
[03:45:50.474 --> 03:45:57.756]  BioTrue Selenium's formula is far from synthetic and is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[03:45:57.756 --> 03:45:59.937]  Our super high quality nascent iodine
[03:46:00.077 --> 03:46:06.399]  This is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99% ultra pure deep earth iodine crystals.

[03:46:43.029 --> 03:46:45.690]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:46:57.292 --> 03:47:05.773]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:47:12.897 --> 03:47:14.899]  Welcome back.
[03:47:14.899 --> 03:47:27.487]  I'm Roger Stone, and yes, you're here at the InfoWars.com on the Alex Jones Show, where I'm sitting in for my friend and fellow patriot, Alex Jones.
[03:47:27.487 --> 03:47:37.094]  A major story that we broke here at InfoWars.com involved the former Chinese intelligence agent Miles Kwok.
[03:47:37.854 --> 03:47:56.535]  And the efforts to keep this Hillary Clinton bundler and George Soros associate, who's currently living in the United States illegally in New York City, from being extradited to the Chinese homeland.
[03:47:57.576 --> 03:48:06.201]  As we discussed, when we broke the story here on InfoWars, it got major international coverage.
[03:48:06.201 --> 03:48:08.823]  And here is an important update.
[03:48:08.823 --> 03:48:13.005]  Evidently, Mr. Kwok went to Washington, D.C.
[03:48:13.005 --> 03:48:19.229]  today where he was supposed to speak to the neocon think tank, the Hudson Institute.
[03:48:20.069 --> 03:48:27.597]  At the last minute, I believe at the behest of our State Department, that speech was cancelled.
[03:48:27.597 --> 03:48:41.931]  We also learned that Kwok was to hold a press conference at the National Press Club today, and evidently, again, from governmental pressure, that event was also cancelled.
[03:48:42.532 --> 03:48:50.256]  Now, we've reported that Kwok has deep ties to Iran and the United Arab Emirates.
[03:48:50.256 --> 03:48:58.699]  In my opinion, he is a national security risk, but more importantly, he's become a sticking point in Sino-U.S.
[03:48:58.699 --> 03:48:59.340]  relations.
[03:49:00.020 --> 03:49:17.058]  When President Trump met in Palm Beach with Xi, the Chinese leader, this was one of the sticking points in getting Chinese cooperation on the issue of North Korea.
[03:49:17.819 --> 03:49:33.920]  This past weekend, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein visited Beijing, China, and China agreed to even more sanctions on North Korea out of those meetings.
[03:49:35.242 --> 03:49:37.904]  President Donald Trump deserves a lot of credit.
[03:49:37.904 --> 03:49:39.966]  Never in history has a U.S.
[03:49:39.966 --> 03:49:45.029]  president gotten so much cooperation from China vis-a-vis North Korea.
[03:49:45.029 --> 03:49:49.853]  Barack Obama, you recall, attempted and failed.
[03:49:49.853 --> 03:49:54.156]  But now, this issue of quack came up at the meetings.
[03:49:54.156 --> 03:49:58.059]  Tillerson and Rosenstein have both promised the Chinese government
[03:49:58.659 --> 03:50:13.007]  That the Chinese rogue intelligence agent turned Obama, pardon me, Clinton bundler and longtime Soros associate will be extradited to face criminal charges in China.
[03:50:13.007 --> 03:50:19.811]  Remember, Kwok is found guilty of both financial crimes there and here.
[03:50:19.811 --> 03:50:25.415]  The Chinese government has repeatedly told the Trump White House they want Kwok extradited.
[03:50:26.135 --> 03:50:47.144]  Now, Kwok is a sophisticated intelligence agent, and with the help of super-liberal Democratic lawyer David Boies, you remember him, he represented Al Gore in the 2000 Florida recount, they have launched a counter-intelligence scheme.
[03:50:48.064 --> 03:50:57.508]  Kwok was being represented by a law firm on his asylum application in a last-ditch attempt to avoid extradition to China.
[03:50:57.508 --> 03:51:07.473]  My sources tell me that the law firm dumped Kwok because he lied on that application and he failed to disclose his criminal record in China.
[03:51:07.473 --> 03:51:14.376]  Kwok then hired hackers to hack the law firm and release his asylum application on Twitter.
[03:51:15.376 --> 03:51:23.498]  Now, warmongers and anti-Trumpists in the government are using this to try to stop the extradition.
[03:51:23.498 --> 03:51:28.479]  Is it odd that the National Security Advisor, H.R.
[03:51:28.479 --> 03:51:44.462]  McMaster, with deep ties to a think tank funded by George Soros, seems to be the lone voice within the Trump administration opposing extradition of Quack, a known Soros associate?
[03:51:45.362 --> 03:51:49.845]  Once again, Quack traveled to the United States on a false passport.
[03:51:49.845 --> 03:51:56.791]  He's in business with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and a national security risk.
[03:51:56.791 --> 03:52:08.940]  The President is being undermined by McMaster, but appears that this could be leading to the extradition of Mr. Quack.
[03:52:09.760 --> 03:52:19.943]  And therefore greater Chinese cooperation in our efforts to isolate the one they call Rocket Man.
[03:52:19.943 --> 03:52:21.803]  Let us look at the clock here if we can.
[03:52:21.803 --> 03:52:28.925]  And let me say that we broke that story here on InfoWars.
[03:52:28.925 --> 03:52:31.806]  And it was the shot heard around the world.
[03:52:32.446 --> 03:52:34.527]  We will bring you the latest.
[03:52:34.527 --> 03:52:40.649]  You won't read it in the Washington Post or in the New York Times.
[03:52:40.649 --> 03:52:46.972]  You see there a piece of agate prop by Michael Forsyth of the New York Times.
[03:52:46.972 --> 03:52:57.977]  There are many in the mainstream media attempting to cover Kwok's tracks, but we here at InfoWars have brought you the inside story.
[03:52:59.157 --> 03:53:13.770]  Imagine my shock this morning when I went to the mailbox and I opened the two invoices from the attorneys who represented me before the House Intelligence Committee only last week.
[03:53:13.770 --> 03:53:20.775]  I had just seen their previous bills, because as many of you know, and as we broke right here at Infowars.com,
[03:53:21.656 --> 03:53:34.871]  I'm being sued by an Obama front organization called the Project for Democracy who have sued me, Donald Trump, and the Trump campaign with the phony claim, yet again,
[03:53:35.814 --> 03:53:45.680]  That we assisted the Russians in hacking the Democratic National Committee and then handed that material over to WikiLeaks.
[03:53:45.680 --> 03:53:47.781]  It's a falsehood, folks.
[03:53:47.781 --> 03:53:49.322]  It's a fraud.
[03:53:49.322 --> 03:53:50.843]  A fairy tale.
[03:53:50.843 --> 03:53:52.244]  It never happened.
[03:53:52.244 --> 03:53:59.829]  But that doesn't stop somebody, in this case a large group of somebodies, a group of fairly prominent attorneys, all alum
[03:54:00.609 --> 03:54:00.809]  Of course.
[03:54:16.494 --> 03:54:22.059]  Well, the bottom line, folks, is that my legal bills have now hit $426,000.
[03:54:22.059 --> 03:54:30.787]  Yes, that's what it costs just to defend yourself from the leftist onslaught.
[03:54:30.787 --> 03:54:39.756]  I am being pursued not because I've done anything wrong, but because I support Donald Trump and I'll never quit.
[03:54:39.756 --> 03:54:41.117]  I'll never stop.
[03:54:41.117 --> 03:54:41.858]  And they know it.
[03:54:42.458 --> 03:54:45.821]  Frankly, I think this is all meant to be a distraction.
[03:54:45.821 --> 03:54:59.695]  So if you want to help the Stone family, if you want to help with these exorbitant legal expenses, you can go to StoneDefenseFund.com, which will take you to Who Framed Roger Stone?
[03:55:00.296 --> 03:55:07.440]  You see a brief description of the charges that I am fighting, the phony charges.
[03:55:07.440 --> 03:55:11.022]  I point out that I still have not heard from the U.S.
[03:55:11.022 --> 03:55:25.350]  Senate Intelligence Committee and I fully expect to testify there in the coming weeks or months, which is why I'm highly confident my legal expenses are going to top a half million dollars.
[03:55:25.350 --> 03:55:25.531]  Now,
[03:55:26.731 --> 03:55:28.773]  I am not a wealthy man.
[03:55:28.773 --> 03:55:30.835]  My books do pretty well.
[03:55:30.835 --> 03:55:35.679]  They pay me a nice stipend here at Infowars.com.
[03:55:35.679 --> 03:55:38.661]  But I treasure my independence.
[03:55:38.661 --> 03:55:49.090]  I turned down a dozen opportunities to join big Washington lobbying firms where I could have traded my relationships in Trump world for millions of dollars.
[03:55:49.090 --> 03:55:50.511]  I did that in the 80s.
[03:55:50.511 --> 03:55:52.712]  I have no interest in doing it again.
[03:55:53.493 --> 03:56:06.884]  So I have to rely on friends and supporters like you, patriots who know the truth, and therefore any contribution at the stonedefensefund.com will be deeply appreciated.
[03:56:06.884 --> 03:56:17.272]  While you're at it, however, I want you to go to the infowars.com store, where the entire line of Emmerich essential oils and products are available.

[03:56:41.787 --> 03:56:45.210]  Uh, suntan lotion, bug spray.
