[02:04.680 --> 02:10.360]  they found one of the two 50 caliber weapons traced back to the ATF program
[02:10.360 --> 02:15.400]  sources said out of the roughly 2,000 weapons sold through Fast and Furious
[02:15.400 --> 02:21.240]  34 were 50 caliber rifles that can take down a helicopter El Chapo would put his
[02:21.240 --> 02:25.520]  guardsmen on hilltops to be on guard for Mexican police helicopters that would
[02:25.520 --> 02:29.920]  fly through valleys conducting raids the sole purpose of the guardsmen would be
[02:29.920 --> 02:34.640]  to shoot down those helicopters this is the third time a weapon from the Fast
[02:34.640 --> 02:39.800]  and Furious program has been found at a high-profile Mexican crime scene now the
[02:39.800 --> 02:44.320]  US Department of Justice under the direction of Loretta Lynch is in the
[02:44.320 --> 02:49.000]  middle of an extradition battle waged by US Attorney offices in New York Chicago
[02:49.000 --> 02:55.600]  Miami El Paso in San Diego while Lynch whose office under former DOJ head Eric
[02:55.600 --> 03:00.480]  Holder committed the first case of criminal and civil contempt of Congress
[03:00.480 --> 03:05.280]  due to his responsibility for aiding and abetting the very drug lord Lynch
[03:05.280 --> 03:10.320]  claims to intend to prosecute but Holder isn't in a maximum security prison
[03:10.320 --> 03:15.080]  meanwhile Hillary Clinton praises Holder by tweeting from protecting voting
[03:15.080 --> 03:19.160]  rights to challenging discrimination Eric Holder was one of our finest
[03:19.160 --> 03:26.280]  attorneys general honored by his support Hillary ah the hubris of criminals they
[03:26.280 --> 03:30.400]  just can't help themselves back in jolly old England mega corporate
[03:30.400 --> 03:34.800]  criminal Stewart Gulliver who admitted in 2012 to laundering hundreds of
[03:34.800 --> 03:39.800]  millions of dollars for El Chapo's Sinaloa drug cartel where is Gulliver
[03:39.800 --> 03:43.460]  after the deaths of a hundred thousand plus and twenty thousand missing
[03:43.460 --> 03:47.720]  Mexicans were funded by the monumental three hundred and seventy six billion
[03:47.720 --> 03:53.280]  dollars of drug money HSBC handled for Wachovia Gulliver is currently at the
[03:53.280 --> 03:59.600]  Davos con fab still operating as the group chief executive of HSBC making
[03:59.600 --> 04:03.640]  decisions with 61 other criminal billionaires determining the amount of
[04:03.640 --> 04:08.560]  carbon taxes they will be fleecing from the unsuspecting populace the
[04:08.560 --> 04:13.320]  telegraph writes mr. Gulliver is on a panel on business and climate change he
[04:13.320 --> 04:19.800]  appears largely supportive of the COP 21 decree agreed at Paris in December but
[04:19.800 --> 04:25.040]  says there cannot be a binary moment when everyone drops oil and gas companies
[04:25.040 --> 04:30.280]  and Guardian journalist Jill trainer tweets Gulliver warns Davos of pulling
[04:30.280 --> 04:35.280]  out of all fossil fuel investments as they are providers of jobs and taxes and
[04:35.280 --> 04:41.760]  Gulliver also says the maths do work when asked about financing of green fuel at
[04:41.760 --> 04:47.040]  Davos the public wants to do this according to global mafia chief Stewart
[04:47.040 --> 04:53.200]  Gulliver as El Chapo sits in a maximum security prison he has already escaped he
[04:53.200 --> 04:57.480]  embodies the mentality of a global criminal organization Goliath that
[04:57.480 --> 05:05.320]  protects right who do you prefer Barack Obama for George W. Bush well if you
[05:05.320 --> 05:09.920]  haven't figured it out by now these guys are corporate spokesman they're not
[05:09.920 --> 05:14.920]  leaders I mean they both started illegal wars hell they both tortured people

[05:20.080 --> 05:25.040]  the Constitution and they even committed war crimes so what's it gonna take I mean
[05:25.040 --> 05:30.080]  what will it take to finally wake you up think about it if Joseph Stalin ran for
[05:30.080 --> 05:34.960]  president as a Democrat and Adolf Hitler ran as a Republican one of them
[05:34.960 --> 05:40.480]  would end up leading our country it's politics incorporated and your choice

[08:16.520 --> 08:42.440]  listening to Alex Jones my friends we are kicking off another global
[08:42.440 --> 08:49.360]  transmission on this Thursday 21st day of January 2016 thank you for joining us
[08:49.360 --> 08:58.680]  today every few days or every week or so there is a major theme that emerges in
[08:58.680 --> 09:02.600]  the news and it could come from the new media the alternative media or the
[09:02.600 --> 09:08.880]  dinosaur media in the last few weeks they've had the theme that oh we're
[09:08.880 --> 09:13.880]  growing humanoids inside farm animals and harvesting their organs but we're
[09:13.880 --> 09:19.920]  not going to show it to you it's quasi-secret and then there's no debate
[09:19.920 --> 09:28.880]  about do these creatures have rights is their biological species problems here
[09:28.880 --> 09:35.520]  giving rise to zoological viruses and bacteria which we know there is and so
[09:35.520 --> 09:38.880]  it just comes out for a week or two and then it just blows over and now it's
[09:38.880 --> 09:47.680]  just accepted there's no cultural resistance and now they've gone in the
[09:47.680 --> 09:51.600]  last really month there's been another theme that's intensifying this week that
[09:51.600 --> 09:54.360]  you know what there is a global depression you know what there is a
[09:54.360 --> 10:01.320]  global collapse you know what America's best days are behind it now we're headed
[10:01.320 --> 10:06.160]  downhill like a snowball headed for hell with no chance for freedom or to
[10:06.160 --> 10:13.000]  ring the Liberty Bell to quote Merle Hagger and I love how the establishment
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.800]  comes along to tell you we're about to go into a hardcore depression right as
[10:16.800 --> 10:21.680]  it intensifies and then they'll probably give themselves some Peabody awards some
[10:21.680 --> 10:25.960]  Pulitzer prizes or something while attacking and full wars calm and yours
[10:25.960 --> 10:29.600]  truly we're telling you about it years ago and telling you exactly what would
[10:29.600 --> 10:33.880]  cause the crisis because it's a foregone conclusion the bigger issue is they're
[10:33.880 --> 10:38.440]  going to use these crises now to get even more regulations passed on a little
[10:38.440 --> 10:44.960]  guy and more banker bailout corporate welfare of our money to them they're
[10:44.960 --> 10:49.960]  engineering this financial storm to consolidate control and loot the day
[10:49.960 --> 10:56.480]  lights out of us are going to go over all of that but when you read our best
[10:56.480 --> 11:01.240]  days behind us they then say oh it's because there's not enough taxes not
[11:01.240 --> 11:07.440]  enough regulations that's what Davos said five years ago we need that's the
[11:07.440 --> 11:11.360]  public Bilderberg group meeting now ongoing high atop a mountain until this
[11:11.360 --> 11:17.200]  weekend there in Davos Switzerland we need a hundred trillion dollars every
[11:17.200 --> 11:22.520]  decade of a new global currency so that we can save the world and give you
[11:22.520 --> 11:29.680]  jobs and it's a hundred trillion backed by carbon taxes currency taxes wire
[11:29.680 --> 11:34.880]  transfer taxes credit card usage taxes just just just raping you in the
[11:34.880 --> 11:38.960]  casual society once they've got you in the cash of society they can charge you
[11:38.960 --> 11:42.440]  five ten dollars every time you use your card they can charge you when you
[11:42.440 --> 11:45.480]  transfer your paycheck into your account they can regulate and track
[11:45.480 --> 11:49.480]  everything you do they can end underground economies that are essential
[11:49.480 --> 11:56.600]  during tyrannical economies just to survive this is a scientific takeover
[11:56.600 --> 12:04.240]  sure enough the main push is global government and class warfare and saving
[12:04.240 --> 12:12.120]  the poor this from the top micron percent we've done the math of their
[12:12.120 --> 12:15.440]  six thousand superclass in the world according to Henry Kissinger and Roth
[12:15.440 --> 12:19.520]  Cop and the Kissinger group which I agree with that's top technicians top
[12:19.520 --> 12:24.920]  billionaires and then above them just a few families that control that if you
[12:24.920 --> 12:30.080]  add six thousand people and then say they have half the wealth of the planet and
[12:30.080 --> 12:36.720]  you divide that out the numbers I forget was it nine or ten zeros zero zero
[12:36.720 --> 12:41.920]  zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero and then I think it was two
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.000]  three but you can do the math I mean you can look at different estimations of
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.760]  world wealth and then just divide six thousand people but we'll first cut that
[12:50.760 --> 12:55.480]  wealth in half and then divide that number six thousand into that and then
[12:55.480 --> 13:00.880]  you get a basic percentage point we're not talking about the 1% we're not
[13:00.880 --> 13:05.920]  talking about the 2% the 1% are the people that own a big boat at the
[13:05.920 --> 13:08.920]  harbor they're the people that get their hair done there's people that buy cars
[13:08.920 --> 13:13.360]  they're the people that buy curtains they're the people that put their kids
[13:13.360 --> 13:17.440]  through college they're the folks that build companies they're the drivers of
[13:17.440 --> 13:21.640]  society they're the Renaissance and let me tell you they're an endangered
[13:21.640 --> 13:27.280]  species just like the Great Plains Buffalo once there were many now they're
[13:27.280 --> 13:31.080]  down to about a third of what they were in the 50s all over the world from
[13:31.080 --> 13:39.720]  Japan to the US and soon they'll be gone and you'll have a tiny tiny percentage
[13:39.720 --> 13:43.560]  of people that have basically everything and this is in the age of
[13:43.560 --> 13:50.880]  liberalism the age of high taxes the age of regulation the age of of Davos and
[13:50.880 --> 13:58.920]  the forums and carbon taxes and just everything should be so good and the
[13:58.920 --> 14:04.400]  scholarships and the tuition and just all the freebies and all the goodies and
[14:04.400 --> 14:11.720]  it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse so that's the big
[14:11.720 --> 14:15.680]  theme here today we've got a bunch of guys coming on a ton of news
[14:15.680 --> 14:24.000]  international intrigue KGB supposed murders stealth wars Leanne McAdoo
[14:24.000 --> 14:31.560]  reporting from the ground in Flint Michigan and more but before we do all
[14:31.560 --> 14:38.360]  that let's just look at the real state of the world there is unprecedented
[14:38.360 --> 14:44.000]  exponential wealth capacity with technological developments every time
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.720]  our economy grew to five six seven percent the Federal Reserve would come
[14:48.720 --> 14:54.280]  in and say it's overheating we're going to regulate it we're gonna raise
[14:54.280 --> 14:58.280]  interest rates we're gonna do this we're gonna do that and everything is
[14:58.280 --> 15:02.840]  maneuvering us into collapse and that's what the I'm of a World Bank doing
[15:02.840 --> 15:07.760]  third world countries that's what they're now doing here Mexico is an
[15:07.760 --> 15:13.760]  incredibly gorgeous wealthy country when it comes to actual resources and
[15:13.760 --> 15:19.440]  Mexico has more billionaires because Mexico is a microcosm of America Mexico
[15:19.440 --> 15:25.080]  has more billionaires per capita for their 130 million population or whatever
[15:25.080 --> 15:28.560]  it is right now let's look up the population of Mexico it's growing all
[15:28.560 --> 15:32.280]  the time and then there's the 60 million here of course the US State
[15:32.280 --> 15:37.840]  Department police capacity nonexistent in Mexican state bordering Texas and then
[15:37.840 --> 15:44.080]  it goes over all these other states in Texas or in Mexico where they say it's
[15:44.080 --> 15:47.680]  completely lawless and the most dangerous country in the world and don't go
[15:47.680 --> 15:52.520]  there well it's safe to go to Cancun or a few other controlled zones but that's
[15:52.520 --> 15:59.320]  it Mexico is a fallen failed state run by the same criminals I mean it's come
[15:59.320 --> 16:04.360]  out with Wacovia Wells Fargo the other big six banks all running the airplanes
[16:04.360 --> 16:08.520]  laundering the drug money again Bloomberg five years ago in two years
[16:08.520 --> 16:18.240]  reported that in 2008 and 2009 Wacovia and Wells Fargo laundered 378 billion
[16:18.240 --> 16:22.040]  dollars in Mexican drug money in two years and that's just two of the big
[16:22.040 --> 16:28.160]  banks they ran the airplanes they ran the guns and then it came out the same
[16:28.160 --> 16:33.400]  airplanes were being used to fly kidnapped people on oh but the bankers
[16:33.400 --> 16:38.680]  wear suits they're nice Warren Buffett eats ice cream on TV and plays tennis
[16:38.680 --> 16:44.600]  give me a break and now they're gonna lock up Al Chapo say goodnight to the
[16:44.600 --> 16:50.320]  bad guy and he is a bad guy but he's nothing compared to these people the
[16:50.320 --> 16:56.120]  Sinaloa cartel was the main CIA driven cartel on record it's been in the
[16:56.120 --> 16:59.680]  Chicago Tribune been in the El Paso times his number two guy got caught
[16:59.680 --> 17:03.560]  extra diving he got up in court and said here's my CIA code name here and the
[17:03.560 --> 17:08.040]  judge's federal judge goes whoa whoa shut it down and then one day later said
[17:08.040 --> 17:16.240]  he is under national security he's who he says release him release him and the
[17:16.240 --> 17:22.360]  feds grabbed him again and took him to some other court so this is how they
[17:22.360 --> 17:28.060]  operate this is what they do and then you catch the government of this
[17:28.060 --> 17:34.680]  degenerate run system with a Barrett 50 Cal I own the exact Barrett it's the same
[17:34.680 --> 17:39.440]  Marine Corps or Army version that's what they field trips use big bad and
[17:39.440 --> 17:47.440]  camo green and they found of course with illegal weapons like Russian-made RPGs
[17:47.440 --> 17:53.240]  yeah you don't buy a rocket-pro-mill grenade at the gun shop it's all been
[17:53.240 --> 17:57.120]  illegally gotten but they want to blame the Second Amendment caught in the
[17:57.120 --> 18:02.280]  false flag CBS news and it's hardly in the news today comes out oh another gun
[18:02.280 --> 18:05.040]  that our government shipped down there to blame the Second Amendment in a
[18:05.040 --> 18:09.040]  frame up caught with El Chapo and then there's nothing else in the news about
[18:09.040 --> 18:16.000]  today it comes out boom no more coverage just like we had Lewis Farrakhan on
[18:16.000 --> 18:21.440]  and to tell to interview about bringing people together zero almost zero
[18:21.440 --> 18:28.320]  coverage but here's the New York Times America's best days may be behind it
[18:28.320 --> 18:33.240]  and they have a picture of Mary Tyler Moore looking young and devastatingly

[18:36.480 --> 18:40.680]  look at woman right there but I digress I'm just admiring God's creatures take a
[18:40.680 --> 18:44.920]  look back at some of the most popular TV programs in the 60s the Vic Dick Van Dyke
[18:44.920 --> 18:49.440]  show be witch and even Beverly Hillbillies and what do you see and it
[18:49.440 --> 18:53.640]  goes on to describe all the happiness and all the goodness and then per capita
[18:53.640 --> 18:57.440]  income mirroring what you saw but but see that's what men and women work
[18:57.440 --> 19:01.440]  together we've all been taught to fight with each other now and to be losers
[19:01.440 --> 19:05.840]  and we have all these regulations and we shipped our jobs to China and India we
[19:05.840 --> 19:09.680]  got screwed over we trusted the system what made America great was not
[19:09.680 --> 19:13.280]  trusting the system and sticking together and having local government

[24:37.960 --> 24:41.680]  combined meetings many of which have been leaked many of which judicial watch
[24:41.680 --> 24:47.160]  and others have sued and gotten at these North American Union and other global
[24:47.160 --> 24:53.600]  confabs where we learn what happens agreements were made to give China rare
[24:53.600 --> 24:59.040]  earth minerals worldwide that's why they get 97% of rare earth minerals just
[24:59.040 --> 25:07.040]  just a snapshot 90s Google it I'm not kidding China gets 97% of rare earth
[25:07.040 --> 25:14.160]  minerals if a US company tries to go anywhere in the world and get rare
[25:14.160 --> 25:18.000]  earth minerals the federal government sues them shuts them down won't let
[25:18.000 --> 25:21.200]  them import it that's a whole nother scandal you think they're just shutting
[25:21.200 --> 25:25.160]  off our coal plants you think they're just setting up internal tariffs with
[25:25.160 --> 25:29.600]  regulations to make our jobs go to China they're hitting us on thousands of
[25:29.600 --> 25:38.200]  precision warfare economic fronts I get chills when I talk about this I mean
[25:38.200 --> 25:41.240]  holding this country down has been incredibly hard for the globalist but
[25:41.240 --> 25:45.240]  they've done it while using all our money to build a giant military that
[25:45.240 --> 25:49.760]  fights to build the world government and then we get the blame
[25:53.400 --> 25:58.800]  China gets all of our major deepwater ports east and west coast China gets the
[25:58.800 --> 26:06.680]  Panama Canal for free we built it we run it the only passage from the Atlantic
[26:06.680 --> 26:13.840]  into the Pacific other than going around the horn we give them something
[26:13.840 --> 26:25.000]  worth an estimated five trillion dollars in a treaty in 1979 and that it's
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.400]  transferred in 2000 and Congress couldn't even stop it let me just keep
[26:29.400 --> 26:35.520]  going forever our last lead smelting plant closed we can't even produce
[26:35.520 --> 26:43.000]  bullets in America our components are made in China for the fighter planes and
[26:43.000 --> 26:50.600]  the missiles it's a total takeover it isn't dumb the leaders that make bad
[26:50.600 --> 26:55.840]  deals they made deals that's why Maury strong and all these globalists end up
[26:55.840 --> 27:04.760]  retiring in China in Taiwan in Hong Kong they're gone they made the deals
[27:04.760 --> 27:11.800]  with a country that had a billion slaves now a billion three hundred million they
[27:11.800 --> 27:19.080]  sold us out for globalism on purpose and when you see these people on TV and you
[27:19.080 --> 27:23.200]  listen to these pundits and you listen and see every father figure put down in
[27:23.200 --> 27:28.080]  movies and TV and dramas you know you're looking at the enemy of you and your
[27:28.080 --> 27:32.920]  family and your wife and your children and your husband my god people come
[27:32.920 --> 27:38.920]  together and admit you're under attack and stop all the stupid in fighting on
[27:38.920 --> 27:46.600]  race and all this garbage that is the least of our problems Flint Michigan is
[27:46.600 --> 27:51.320]  rotting there's less than 20% of the people that was there back in the 50s
[27:51.320 --> 27:57.880]  and 60s it's gone it's collapsing it's a dead city no amount of money can prop it
[27:57.880 --> 28:03.360]  up it's condemned of course the water systems are scams of course they're
[28:03.360 --> 28:10.320]  full of poison everywhere they can take pure aquifer water out the most pure on
[28:10.320 --> 28:14.640]  earth in Arkansas and they dump hundreds of chemicals in it when they're done
[28:14.640 --> 28:20.800]  under state law multi-nationals came in and lobbied for it because you pay for
[28:20.800 --> 28:24.960]  the poison and now they're going hey this is kind of a hoax you know Flint's
[28:24.960 --> 28:29.040]  water is not any more toxic than a lot of other cities what I've been saying but
[28:29.040 --> 28:37.320]  that's not the hoax the hoax is it's all poison and there are the very Democrats

[34:55.320 --> 34:58.960]  been taught how to have a chip on its shoulder and there's a lot of real things
[34:58.960 --> 35:04.360]  out there that do illustrate that America does have a lot of problems
[35:04.360 --> 35:08.840]  obviously but are they our main problems it's like this boycott the Oscars
[35:08.840 --> 35:13.080]  Will Smith won't be at the Oscars good I don't watch the Oscars I don't even
[35:13.080 --> 35:18.400]  boycott it I just don't worship a bunch of preening peacocks on ego maniac trips
[35:18.400 --> 35:25.280]  I like good films I like good actors but they're not the real world they're the
[35:25.280 --> 35:31.200]  tail I'm the dog they're the tail you're the dog people are like are you excited
[35:31.200 --> 35:34.400]  that Chris Carter knows come out and said that a lot of his new series is
[35:34.400 --> 35:37.840]  based on info wars information and there's a character based on you and
[35:37.840 --> 35:43.280]  I've now talked via email with Carter and his folks and he's a listener and all
[35:43.280 --> 35:45.520]  the rest of it and we're gonna probably get a chance to interview him or talk to
[35:45.520 --> 35:50.680]  him soon I just did that request yesterday but the point is is that when
[35:50.680 --> 35:56.500]  I'm really proud of is that I'm influencing the culture you see we're
[35:56.500 --> 36:03.480]  driving the bus here and that's what you have to realize folks you have the
[36:03.480 --> 36:09.000]  power I told this story a few weeks ago and again it's not about a power trip
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.800]  it's to show the influence you have if you go into an access television show
[36:12.800 --> 36:16.480]  in a good-sized town or city and you do a decent job and have some energy and
[36:16.480 --> 36:19.760]  you know give your opinion and views or you take a video camera out and shoot
[36:19.760 --> 36:24.160]  some reports you will end up getting viewers then you can use that platform
[36:24.160 --> 36:28.240]  to put it on YouTube whatever you want it's like this lady that went to these
[36:28.240 --> 36:31.760]  government meetings and shows them all bragging about quote stealing money and
[36:31.760 --> 36:37.480]  stealing land in Oregon it's sensational video but somebody just had to go to the
[36:37.480 --> 36:44.480]  open event and just see what they're saying it's like we're dodo birds that
[36:44.480 --> 36:47.520]  just sit there when the sailors get off the ships they run over and whack us on
[36:47.520 --> 36:51.400]  the head with a with a ore and then eat us I mean you know the dodo birds didn't
[36:51.400 --> 36:55.440]  run they were extinct in just a few years I mean the politicians their
[36:55.440 --> 36:59.200]  bureaucrats the globalists are just running around robbing everything just
[36:59.200 --> 37:04.480]  just announcing like their folks out of the movie Road Warrior that they're
[37:04.480 --> 37:14.560]  gonna sack our society we're just sitting here like dodo birds taking it but
[37:14.560 --> 37:21.880]  again Mike judge Hank Hill Gribble and one of the other characters on one of
[37:21.880 --> 37:27.720]  the biggest TV shows in history based in a composite of me and two other people
[37:27.720 --> 37:35.680]  I mean King of the Hill X files to but but but here's what's important it's not
[37:35.680 --> 37:40.000]  me saying look these big hit TV shows are partially based on me that was in he
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.240]  was developing that in 95 96 started airing in 97 folks I was on access
[37:46.240 --> 37:49.880]  television and local radio and already influencing people that's what I'm
[37:49.880 --> 37:53.880]  getting at just like this lady who I want to get on by the way guys who who
[37:53.880 --> 38:01.680]  went into these retirement events held by the BLM in these lavish ballrooms with
[38:01.680 --> 38:08.800]  them bragging about their enterprises see it's not that I'm special she's
[38:08.800 --> 38:13.360]  special it's that it's I guess special in a land of zombies and a land of
[38:13.360 --> 38:19.920]  spectators and a land of people that don't take action when you do something
[38:19.920 --> 38:23.880]  original when you do something grassroots it will end up having an effect
[38:23.880 --> 38:27.800]  maybe not the first time you do it maybe not the 10th time you do it but it will
[38:27.800 --> 38:32.760]  end up having a big effect and a lot of times the first time somebody goes out
[38:32.760 --> 38:38.560]  to expose corruption I mean talk about Providence again 2000 was all over the
[38:38.560 --> 38:43.480]  news nationwide one of our first big huge stories we had a lot before that but
[38:43.480 --> 38:47.740]  it was big and lady goes Alex better come out of the state rep you know
[38:47.740 --> 38:52.000]  meeting hall I was about to testify there's bribery going on and like a movie
[38:52.000 --> 39:03.120]  the head of the gun control group was going 100 200 good testimony and we just
[39:03.120 --> 39:10.440]  caught that on tape and it defeated a bunch of gun bills they admitted and then
[39:10.440 --> 39:13.600]  the paper called up and said why are you racist the people he was paying were
[39:13.600 --> 39:17.200]  black would you have said this they were white and I said of course but the real
[39:17.200 --> 39:22.320]  racism was the white gun control guy with the three young black men who didn't
[39:22.320 --> 39:25.640]  act like that behind the scenes but once they got up on the stage they went
[39:25.640 --> 39:34.640]  yo yo yo I got guns I'll hurt y'all take you down I'm a dangerous thug playing the part
[39:35.920 --> 39:43.720]  actors from Houston from an art program we later learned we're paid to get up
[39:43.720 --> 39:50.720]  there and go yo yo you know stereotypical black thug be like in the white
[39:50.720 --> 39:55.040]  gotta be a stereotypical white thug you know and say I'm racist or something I
[39:55.040 --> 40:00.360]  mean it was so sick here they were engaged in the racism look at look at
[40:00.360 --> 40:04.120]  Michael Moore perched on top Flint Michael Moore worth over a hundred
[40:04.120 --> 40:10.080]  million dollars there at Flint doing racism racism genocide against blacks
[40:10.080 --> 40:14.040]  60% of the town's blacks was genocide but never saying a word about all the
[40:14.040 --> 40:17.880]  poison water never pointing out why all this is really happening saying
[40:17.880 --> 40:22.520]  socialism is the answer to fix Flint Flint's gone you might be able to
[40:22.520 --> 40:25.800]  stabilize parts of Detroit
[40:29.920 --> 40:34.760]  it's sick to watch these people operate and that's why America's best days are
[40:34.760 --> 40:41.280]  behind it now until we wake up and realize what's happening now before we
[40:41.280 --> 40:44.520]  go any further into the news and some clips I want to get to this is Wayne
[40:44.520 --> 40:50.360]  Madsen reported info wars dot com u.s. harbors ices link terrorists u.s.
[40:50.360 --> 40:54.360]  changes status of ices link group to protected organization this is
[40:54.360 --> 41:05.480]  documented it is a big big deal and Wayne Madsen will be joining us to talk
[41:05.480 --> 41:11.640]  about this and more there's another article he had yesterday that we
[41:11.640 --> 41:17.680]  published at info wars dot com globalist covering up jihadist violence
[41:17.680 --> 41:23.920]  international agreement between some nations to downplay migrant crisis and
[41:23.920 --> 41:32.480]  he's got the scoop on that but it is an organized planetary agenda that is
[41:32.480 --> 41:38.240]  constantly being tweaked and adjusted but moving in the same direction and
[41:38.240 --> 41:43.520]  going along with it only ensures things are going to get worse now before I get
[41:43.520 --> 41:46.840]  into the Trump news because it ties into all this let's get into the financial
[41:46.840 --> 41:52.280]  news global stocks sink on fresh growth fears remember three weeks ago soros
[41:52.280 --> 41:59.920]  gets up right as the new year starts and on the first of January 21 days ago
[41:59.920 --> 42:09.480]  three weeks ago exactly blows the horn oh the fog horn and says the global
[42:09.480 --> 42:14.320]  collapse has begun when he's all pre-positioned and then like dutiful
[42:14.320 --> 42:20.720]  stewards the mainstream horror media begins to create the panic so they can
[42:20.720 --> 42:23.840]  have their organized collapse which is meant to come it's got to come but
[42:23.840 --> 42:27.480]  they're timing it they're running when it happens just like the Arab Spring to
[42:27.480 --> 42:34.160]  consolidate control global stocks sink on fresh growth fears down industrial
[42:34.160 --> 42:39.120]  pair losses to drop to four nine point while shares in Japan and UK enter bear
[42:39.120 --> 42:46.920]  markets jobless claims jump to seven month high market watch and that's with
[42:46.920 --> 42:52.680]  cook numbers as phony is a $3 booth stock route demotes Twitter CEO Jack
[42:52.680 --> 42:57.560]  Dorsey from billionaire and a millionaire oil prices fall below $28 a
[42:57.560 --> 43:05.040]  barrel less than cost of actual barrel guess who builds those barrels China
[43:05.040 --> 43:09.360]  rare as minerals because there's a set deal where they get every stinking bit
[43:09.360 --> 43:13.960]  of it by agreement you want to have a gold mine you've had for 50 years it's
[43:13.960 --> 43:17.840]  operating making a profit we're gonna shut you down in one year later a Chinese
[43:17.840 --> 43:21.480]  firm's gonna come in and they could dump cyanide right in the river and
[43:21.480 --> 43:27.600]  nothing's gonna be said because there's a deal been made and you ain't in it I'm
[43:27.600 --> 43:32.800]  not in it but they haven't gotten all our guns and they can't get us all to take
[43:32.800 --> 43:37.200]  their vaccines and they're hopping mad and people are refusing their GMOs and
[43:37.200 --> 43:41.000]  people are pulling their kids out of their government-run schools and people
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.640]  are moving away in Exodus from the big cities and the systems mad and is out
[43:45.640 --> 43:49.640]  there trying to shut down every small town and shut down the Amish and shut
[43:49.640 --> 43:54.360]  down small farms but local governments and local police aren't going along with
[43:54.360 --> 43:59.200]  it and are having meetings and know it's a takeover plan and we're getting up on
[43:59.200 --> 44:03.400]  our feet and getting our hands around the globalist throat and its faces turning
[44:03.400 --> 44:09.160]  blue and those little eyes are bugging out of that snot-nosed face and
[44:09.160 --> 44:18.240]  everywhere are the real signs of vengeance rising but it's a dichotomy
[44:18.240 --> 44:26.680]  it's a paradox it's the best of times worst of times it was a summer of
[44:26.680 --> 44:36.280]  heaven and a winter of hell because many people are totally turning themselves
[44:36.280 --> 44:39.360]  over to the system and believing anything it says and they're just
[44:39.360 --> 44:44.400]  committing to being morons and giving up but still a giant minority of people
[44:44.400 --> 44:48.760]  worldwide of every race color creed and religion are waking up to what's
[44:48.760 --> 44:53.520]  happening discovering the rabbit hole and investigating for themselves and
[44:53.520 --> 44:57.600]  once you see it you don't ever turn back and you don't ever shut your mouth
[44:57.600 --> 45:04.240]  once you know what we're really facing apple falls close to freak out level as
[45:04.240 --> 45:17.920]  it continues to plunge losing as much as 3.4 percent in one day yesterday crashing
[45:17.920 --> 45:29.240]  oil prices hit former Texas boom towns yep big time that's just some of the
[45:29.240 --> 45:33.200]  news we're gonna be covering on that front before I go any further though I
[45:33.200 --> 45:39.320]  want to get into Donald Trump as I said earlier Donald Trump is wrong I like
[45:39.320 --> 45:44.920]  Donald Trump the whole Davos elite are absolutely out to getting that's in the
[45:44.920 --> 45:52.760]  news Trump fear stocks Davos as elite prey for spring reality check oh the
[45:52.760 --> 45:57.760]  reality check of the same old bottom paid for candidates on both sides it'll
[45:57.760 --> 46:02.920]  bring us the exact same agenda and the people are desperately waking up going
[46:02.920 --> 46:09.800]  for anybody they think is Americana like Trump or Cruz concerns over
[46:09.800 --> 46:14.600]  protectionism and u.s. reputation bubble up ex-white house advisor still thinks
[46:14.600 --> 46:21.640]  Obama will be nominee protectionism you mean we're China can have massive
[46:21.640 --> 46:26.320]  tariffs and stuff on us but we can't on them where the world trade organization
[46:26.320 --> 46:30.600]  keeps ruling on behalf of them and where they keep their currency super low
[46:30.600 --> 46:35.400]  another tariff and all the and a slave labor and the no environmental
[46:35.400 --> 46:42.360]  regulations but we have all of them so we can't compete they're shutting down our
[46:42.360 --> 46:45.720]  power plants but not theirs are building more oh you're worried about
[46:45.720 --> 46:49.960]  protectionism what about being screwed over by the globalist all he said is
[46:49.960 --> 46:54.120]  he's not gonna let these one-sided deals continue and he's gonna put economic
[46:54.120 --> 46:57.240]  pressure on China by the way we're already imploding anyways under the
[46:57.240 --> 47:04.880]  Walmart Chinese Communist model and there's an article up on info wars dot com
[47:04.880 --> 47:15.200]  that breaks all this down Trump has now come out and responded to Glenn Beck
[47:15.200 --> 47:19.880]  who's constantly attacking him saying he's a Hillary plant I see no evidence
[47:19.880 --> 47:23.800]  of that he's been viciously going after Hillary on the rapes and all the rest of
[47:23.800 --> 47:28.720]  it and the Clintons are in big trouble because of it something the other
[47:28.720 --> 47:36.120]  Republicans won't do and so the bottom line is we don't need Glenn Beck and
[47:36.120 --> 47:42.680]  Donald Trump fighting but that's what Beck's gonna do to insert himself into
[47:42.680 --> 47:47.560]  this and he's now going around with Cruz which I think is a big mistake I don't
[47:47.560 --> 47:51.600]  care if he campaigns with him but making an all-in-attack on Donald Trump and
[47:51.600 --> 47:56.320]  it's gonna blow up both their faces and you notice that suddenly not because of
[47:56.320 --> 48:00.400]  the paleon endorsement in my view but because of the attacks that Cruz is
[48:00.400 --> 48:05.160]  involved in on Trump Cruz is starting to go down in polls in New Hampshire and
[48:05.160 --> 48:12.440]  other areas the exact same thing that Rand Paul did six months ago and I told
[48:12.440 --> 48:19.400]  him on air off air I said do not attack Trump if you want to beat him pick up the
[48:19.400 --> 48:25.880]  rhetoric the Americana rhetoric didn't listen to me and I like Rand Paul he
[48:25.880 --> 48:33.280]  was on last week but Trump's now history he's got the whole establishment
[48:33.280 --> 48:36.320]  against him even if he hasn't been perfect in the past he wants to be
[48:36.320 --> 48:40.200]  president he wants to be the guy that's the turnaround executive that helps save
[48:40.200 --> 48:43.640]  America and that's not in the globalist plan so look for him to blow up his
[48:43.640 --> 48:47.320]  airplane or shoot him or you know put dead bodies in his backyard or say he's a
[48:47.320 --> 48:50.880]  child molester I mean get ready folks they're gonna pull out the stops say
[48:50.880 --> 48:57.160]  he's a mafia Don who knows but Trump mocks Cruz plan to campaign with Waco
[48:57.160 --> 49:01.880]  Glenn Beck Donald Trump calls one back endorsement of Ted Cruz a sad answer to
[49:01.880 --> 49:06.800]  Sarah Palin endorsement Donald Trump mock Lenbeck's planned appearances with
[49:06.800 --> 49:10.320]  Ted Cruz in Iowa in the coming days portraying it as a sad answer to Sarah
[49:10.320 --> 49:15.080]  Palin's endorsement of his own candidacy earlier this week yeah what that is is
[49:15.080 --> 49:21.280]  basically clear channel endorsing Cruz whatever I'll take either one of them
[49:21.280 --> 49:25.640]  but we don't need these two damaging each other ahead of this to help Hillary
[49:25.640 --> 49:30.560]  and I know their answer is hey Alex we got to beat each other okay well Cruz
[49:30.560 --> 49:33.600]  you're not gonna beat Trump doing that I'd be just as happy with you in there
[49:33.600 --> 49:39.840]  quite frankly but you've been given bad advice buddy you really have been in
[49:39.840 --> 49:44.400]  there's this whole line that Trump's establishment because he says the
[49:44.400 --> 49:47.720]  establishment's been calling him lately saying you know let off will work with
[49:47.720 --> 49:50.840]  you that's Trump saying he's having victory when the establishment comes
[49:50.840 --> 49:57.360]  groveling on their knees on their all fours that smells like victory that
[49:57.360 --> 50:00.400]  doesn't see I've always said I want to take over the establishment return the
[50:00.400 --> 50:04.480]  Republic not just hide out in the woods with a gun imagining I'm a secret agent
[50:04.480 --> 50:09.760]  I want to take the Republic back I want to win and then dismantle the
[50:09.760 --> 50:16.760]  government 90% that's what a statesman does what a leader does you have to be
[50:16.760 --> 50:22.400]  ready to win folks you have to be ready to win or you'll never win but the
[50:22.400 --> 50:26.480]  churches have taught us it's the end of the world foregone conclusion there's
[50:26.480 --> 50:29.560]  nothing we can do it's the end of the world so just don't believe it ain't
[50:29.560 --> 50:33.000]  gonna ever be fixed don't worry about your kids on drugs or whatever they're
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.480]  doing just sit back and just turn everything loose let the government run
[50:36.480 --> 50:41.080]  things and Jesus will fix it all well that's not what the my Bible tells me
[50:41.080 --> 50:44.280]  and we're in trouble look at the fruits of what we've done in this country
[50:44.280 --> 50:48.720]  turning things over and laying down that articles up on info wars.com the big

[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:40.840]  with the designed implosion of the world economy we've got the establishment
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:46.120]  Western media after many years of beating around the bush claiming they
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:50.640]  think that the Russian government killed this former spy saying now that the
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:55.120]  British inquiry the UK inquiry is saying no we believe Putin without having the
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:59.520]  evidence was behind it and that's done so they can have more sanctions on Russia
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.720]  and and really ratchet things up meanwhile our leaders call for killing
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:11.160]  Sudden constantly well he exposed criminal illegal spying on the American
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:16.560]  people that they've been lying about this guy had done something entirely
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.920]  different Russia's Putin probably approved London murder of KGB agent
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:28.400]  Lita Vinko UK inquiry finds president Vladimir Putin probably approved the 2006
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:33.920]  that's 10 years ago Russian intelligence operation to murder former KGB agent
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:40.080]  Alexander Lita Vinko I pronounced that right with radioactive polonium 210 in
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:46.120]  London a British inquiry concluded on Thursday prompting a row or fight with
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:50.240]  Moscow Russia which had declined a cooperative inquiry cautioned pointedly
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.400]  that it could quote poison relations pun intended Britain accused the Kremlin of
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:00.400]  uncivilized behavior the UK funding ISIS to kill hundreds of thousands of
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.200]  Christians and set up Libyan overthrow it with the French and others and
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:10.160]  uncivilized or or running the IRA for decades and bombing things the IRA not
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:13.840]  even knowing it was being run by them as a pretext to keep troops in Ireland
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:18.880]  uncivilized I'm not against the British folks I mean you know
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.560]  anytime you bash a corrupt government people say why are you bashing my
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:26.880]  country it's not a country it's a globalist command base feeding on the
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:34.360]  British to the Irish doesn't matter from the pick Scots to all these Gaelic and
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:39.080]  Norse tribes and the fact that the old Kings could get all the tribes killing
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:42.440]  each other just shows how divide and conquer works you people are all
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:47.600]  basically genetically one half of one percent may be different as you're all
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:51.960]  related you're murdering each other like morons as usual and that's just how
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.720]  they control everybody in Africa they'll get one tribe to kill the other to
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:03:00.760]  using anthropology using sociology that's what the CIA and others do and
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:07.040]  people love it people love to be played but of inco 43 an outspoken critic of
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.960]  Putin who had fled Russia for Britain six years to the day before he was
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.760]  poisoned died of a drinking green tea laced with a rare and very potent
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:19.920]  radioactive isotope at London's Millennium Hotel an inquiry led by
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:25.560]  senior British judge Robert Owen found that former KGB bodyguard
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:34.160]  and really how do you say that A&D REI Andre how do you say that look look at
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.720]  what I thought and we'd even have a person speaks Russian here to help me
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:42.040]  folks and another Russian carried out the killing as part of an operation
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:46.360]  probably directed by Russia's federal security services the main air to the
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:52.040]  Soviet ex KGB notice that they get there and say Putin kills all the press and
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:56.240]  they never show any proof and then they have Donald Trump saying okay well show
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.480]  me the proof and then fine but they can't do it and they don't have any proof
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:05.400]  here the FSB operation to kill mr. Levin co I was probably approved by them
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:12.480]  then head of the FSB and also mr. Putin Owen said I have concluded that there
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:19.360]  is strong possibility that they poisoned mr. Levin eco he did so under the
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.880]  direction of the FSB I have further concluded and then they go on to
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.640]  basically blame him with no proof but I mean there's a good chance they did
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:31.320]  maybe 40 50% I don't know there's a good chance this guy outlived his usefulness
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.520]  a newer of the bodies were buried and who some of the other defectors were
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:39.520]  showing my six killed him or CIA I mean who knows or a Russian oligarch that
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:44.560]  that's a double agent playing both sides I mean maybe 50% chance the Russians
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:49.040]  did it to send a message but they generally don't even do that because
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.880]  they've had a sophisticated stance of not engaging to not escalate things the
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:05:02.680]  West is escalating the intelligence community's inspector general has just
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:06.840]  revealed to lawmakers that Hillary Clinton had classified documents above
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:11.800]  top secret on her private email server in addition to over 1300 other
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:16.160]  classified emails access to information and the special access program is more
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:20.360]  highly restricted more sensitive than top secret because it would likely reveal
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:25.400]  the source putting lives at risk we're constantly told that our money our rule
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:29.680]  of law our liberties must all be sacrificed on the altar of national
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.600]  security Hillary has violated the surveillance state's religion and she
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.400]  needs to be burned at the stake orange is the new pantsuit Hillary but she's
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:42.200]  being investigated by Obama's Justice Department and she has about as much
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:46.840]  chance of going to jail as a Chicago cop if she gets away with these crimes the
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:51.840]  fraud of the surveillance state will be inescapably obvious to all

[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:29.120]  lying on emails again and then she just says oh no you know none of these were
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.120]  really classified I mean they were all classified they weren't certified
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:36.000]  classified so it's okay point is she lied there were more emails they were
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.480]  classified so it's all coming up but first leon macadoo's gonna be filing

[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:53.040]  folks there on the ground where we've got michael moore and jesse jackson and
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.560]  the usual suspects running around saying the republican governor has poisoned the
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:02.600]  black people in an operation of genocide
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:08.560]  and we've lost our skype connection to her we're gonna get that back in a moment
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:12.760]  but let me give you some of the background on this michigan governor
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:18.760]  under fire over emails i'm not defending him because he's a republican but the
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:27.040]  emails that he's released say it's flint's job to run your wastewater and to
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:33.560]  control this it's not the state's job this has been going on for years and then
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:37.160]  now there's more mainstream reports admitting that the water there's toxic
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:41.040]  like many other areas of the country we're given toxic water these water
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:45.240]  treatment plants usually make it more toxic most areas take it out of aquifers
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.960]  like texas and arkansas oklahoma and other areas huge aquifers in the middle
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:53.560]  of the u.s pure clean water and then they put a bunch of chlorine and fluoride in
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:12:00.680]  it and upwards of 300 other chemicals usually it's about 200 so it's so it's
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:05.880]  all just absolutely out of control and i want to go over all of this there's a
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.840]  bunch of clips of obama now chiming in on this and i want to go to one of them
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:17.120]  where he pledges support to flint you ship the jobs to china and to mexico
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:22.800]  the unions ran what was left out of the state you democrats ran these cities and
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:28.360]  then you sit around blaming people for it and pledging support it's a dead city
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:33.520]  it's a collapsing city you can't fix it there were times when Rome would be
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:37.480]  abandoned for 400 500 years because there was no more infrastructure and then
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:42.920]  it came back slowly that's what happens historically with human migration it's
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:47.040]  dead you can't prop it up and it's not the people of america's job to prop it
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:52.920]  all up forever it's the people's job in flint to filter their water get their
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.800]  own local government in charge kick the foreign controllers out the controller
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:04.000]  water districts or move to another state let's go ahead and go to obama here it
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:17.800]  is to talk for a second about what's happening in flint you know i am very
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:26.560]  proud of what i've done as president but the only job that's more important to
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:35.480]  me is the job of father and i know that if i was a parent up there i would be
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:42.520]  beside myself that my kids health could be at risk i wonder who's gonna fake
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:48.400]  cry again that's why over the weekend i declared a federal emergency in flint to
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:51.760]  send more resources on top of the assistance that we've already just like
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.720]  the feds on the ground didn't Katrina we designated a federal coordinator to
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:58.480]  make sure the people of flint get what they need just like they didn't get
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:04.800]  their people in 9-11 yesterday i met with mayor weaver in the white house in
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:10.480]  the Oval Office and i told her that we are gonna have her back and all the
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:15.000]  people of flint's back oh you got their back work their way through that's
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.960]  enough this terrible tragedy so he sells us out with the republicans obama
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.000]  caremen to screw us over black unemployment doubles under obama worst
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.080]  it's ever been and he uses all this you know urban nomenclature i got your back
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:35.280]  i'm your friend when he's not giving speeches about you can't have air
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:39.520]  conditioning or a car it's not good for the environment africa he doesn't want
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:49.480]  you to have any infrastructure whether you're white or black he's an elitist i
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.480]  tell you all of these governors all of these mayors all of them need to be
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.120]  investigated for the criminality of adding hydrofluorosalic acid to the water
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:01.520]  that harvard admits brain damages you and gives you cancer and even the EPA says
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.440]  get it out of the water for 20 years but they won't because then they got to
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.280]  admit everything else they've done is a lie they dumped toxic waste in the water
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:15.760]  calling it fluoride they sit there running all these scams put in these big
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:21.360]  fancy water treatment facilities give themselves waivers give us all this
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:29.000]  garbage and then grandstand and say it's racism forget racism it's a distraction
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.280]  from what they're doing to everybody what's going on in flint is a crime
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:38.080]  against humanity what about the 40% that aren't black in flint michael more it's
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:42.840]  just crazy how they try to get us to think like that how racist they are how
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:47.040]  he's a big fat race pimp trying to play people off against each other with
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:51.560]  scientific systems of sociology developed by the central intelligence
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:58.160]  agency they're running a playbook hey how about this fluoride on average has
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:07.240]  double the bad health effects in major studies on average on blacks just like
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:11.600]  fluoride is worse for males long-term than his females except in the area of
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.600]  the thyroid is worse for females it varies just type in studies fluoride
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:19.640]  hurts blacks worse oh you're not hearing a word about that from michael more
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:26.760]  because that'd be real that'd be something true michael more is warning to
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:29.760]  president obama don't fly to Detroit and fly out of Detroit and have that
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:36.000]  george bush moment of looking out the window at flint yeah because you screwed
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.560]  over black people so bad part of your job go there and pat them on the head and
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:42.440]  make them think you're gonna help them like that woman going can I please have
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.000]  a house you know I live out of my car and he goes we're gonna get you that
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.640]  house and then it was republicans got of the house my gosh if he was actually
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.240]  gonna tell her he's gonna get her a house is a PR stunt like Oprah handing out
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:57.360]  free cars you should have at least gotten the lady a house but he knows he's got
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:03.120]  her vote and so it's all about not giving her what he says he'll give her in
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.560]  her face

[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:19.920]  society collapses and people give up by then the swindlers that moved on to the
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:24.720]  next country and to their swiss armored redoubts
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:30.600]  well the US State Department basically says Mexico's a failed state don't go
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:34.480]  there with a big travel advisory they just say it's completely lawless
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:40.360]  meanwhile the New York Times tell us today America's best days are behind it
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:46.640]  and why is it's best days behind it because we were brought into debt
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:51.120]  bondage because we gave up and what made the country great but don't worry we got
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:54.280]  Michael Moore and the Socialist and Michael Moore the Democratic Party of
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:58.960]  the Ku Klux Klan running around teaching quote minorities how everything in the
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:04.040]  world is because of something a racist white person did when average whites are
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:11.880]  plunging into poverty as well and are in the exact same boat this is divide and
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.480]  conquer and Michael Moore is a race-baiting pig when he puts out a
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:21.520]  tweet saying blacks are being genocided because the town's 60% black it's 40%
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:25.840]  other people who are all just humans too more how about governments poisoning
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:30.000]  the water how about fluorides worse for black people than Caucasians or others
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.240]  he doesn't care about that because they're the ones put in the water like
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:39.040]  the Democrat John P. Holdren admitted in his book eco science and he's the
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:44.120]  science are remember that these people are monsters and they know what they're
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:49.400]  doing more is a controller meant to look non-threatening in his little
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:57.160]  outfits he is a enemy general with armed guards Leon Macadoo I know it's so
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:01.800]  cold there that the Skype systems froze you're gonna be on the last 20 minutes
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:05.160]  of third hour today with more updates in your report I know you've discovered a
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:09.560]  lot since you've been there thank you for joining us yes thank you Alex yeah we
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:13.160]  did need to move away from the Flint River it was actually frozen there I
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.000]  don't know if you saw the video earlier you could see the icicles hanging there
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.240]  from the toxic waste Flint River and yes it was freezing up the phones so now
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:25.480]  we're here inside the vehicle we're probably gonna move over to a business
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.680]  owner we met earlier today that was talking to us about the water crisis here
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:33.760]  he said we could come on back to his restaurant that's great we'll get a big
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.040]  update then so far since you've been on the ground since yesterday what have you
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:42.960]  seen well I have seen just probably some of the most incredibly dilapidated
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.640]  buildings that I've ever witnessed and people are still living in them and so
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:52.080]  you kind of get a sense of how these people couldn't afford to go buy bottled
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:57.000]  water they don't even have an official grocery store chain here so you'll see
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.400]  some parts of town that they're doing okay and then other parts of town that
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.680]  it's just so they've been so hard hit by the economy here and I mean just
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:10.680]  experiencing this extreme cold to think that the the government here was telling
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:15.480]  people not to take hot showers not to boil the water things like that I mean
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.280]  just things that we take for granted being able to get hot water out of the
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:24.480]  tap to to warm us up you can't do that here it's just it's incredible and the
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:27.880]  town was a shadow of its former self I mean is there any sense there that it's
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:31.360]  time to leave the town that it's collapsed that it's you know should be a
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:35.440]  ghost town for a reason it's a toxic waste dump with rotting pipes and the
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:40.280]  government's feeding them poison water I mean why not just get up and leave well
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.600]  we were kind of asking ourselves that exact same question and then we ended up
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:47.520]  meeting this business owner a young guy he's got six kids and I'm not sure if he
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:51.080]  bought the building that he's in but he's got several businesses sort of
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:55.680]  looped around the building and they're they're kind of apocalypse ready up there
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:59.920]  they live and work out of this building and canned foods and the whole bit but
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:04.840]  he was able to sort of bypass this crisis because he had set up a reverse
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:09.800]  osmosis system in the building and so he hadn't been getting the fluoride getting
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.800]  all of the water and he said that you know it was because he didn't trust the
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:16.000]  fact that the government said oh the Flint River is safe it's perfectly fine
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.880]  and so he had been testing the water every single month getting different
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:23.240]  readings not and he's been proven correct that it wasn't safe
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:28.480]  residents that tested water proven right absolutely and that's why it's so
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:32.360]  important to just filter your own water you have no idea what's coming through
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:37.440]  those pipes now we know that they were since 2014 and probably even before that
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:41.480]  they were well aware that not only was there a lead but they were also having
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:46.080]  Legionella so then we had 10 people actually die from Legionnaires disease
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:50.000]  here and they were trying to prove or disprove that it had something to do with
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.960]  the switching over of the water and by the way Leanne I mean another report you
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:57.640]  can do is numbers of death and Flint being suppressed they always suppress
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:01.200]  stuff like this so I would investigate that and see if they're suppressing
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.760]  numbers see what folks say that's one report I talk about how it looks like a
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:08.640]  third world war zone another report citizens didn't trust government tested
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.040]  water proven right there are so many reports here that you're gonna be
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:15.920]  breaking down for folks to illustrate what's happening but it looks like a
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:21.320]  bellwether for the rest of the country under a post-globalist system right I
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:25.080]  mean the fact that Michael Moore can come in and say it's just a racist thing I
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:29.920]  mean this is happening everywhere Leanne stay there I want to do five more
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:33.560]  minutes with you and get some more angles on this and then I want to get
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:38.800]  Larry Nichols on inside the 2016 campaign Hillary and more are they
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:45.440]  planning to bring Biden in more on Trump more on the ISIS situation it's all
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:52.960]  coming up today we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:56.560]  GCN radio network
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:05.360]  serving as a microcosm of the Obama administration a real estate developer
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.240]  partially demolished the reputed birthplace of the Bill of Rights the
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:14.040]  developer Triple Crown Corp secured a permit to demolish a two-story stone
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:18.480]  building formerly known as James Bell Tavern in Silver Springs Township
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:22.720]  Pennsylvania by the time a third of the building was destroyed the city stopped
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:26.760]  the demolition because officials realized the Bill of Rights was conceived
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:31.920]  at the Tavern during a 1788 meeting how appropriate that part of the building
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:36.560]  has been torn down while other parts remain commenter WC Handy wrote to the
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:40.920]  local Sentinel newspaper we have a Congress that is so intent on destroying
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:45.200]  the Bill of Rights the building as it stands now is rather indicative of the
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:49.680]  current state of our Bill of Rights why not leave the building as it is to serve
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:58.960]  as a reminder to us all he added you can find more reports on info wars com our

[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:41.240]  gonna be shooting some little mini documentary pieces about the families
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:45.240]  that are there and what's happening and the deaths and you know are the deaths
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:49.360]  higher than they've said and the public doesn't trust them and our people
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:54.680]  planning to leave and Mexico's a failed state many areas the US are collapsing
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:58.960]  the police chiefs as things really degenerate say buy guns protect
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.320]  yourselves that's the only thing making the crime rate actually not continue to
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:11.680]  rise so as things unravel people get back to reality but the problem is areas
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:15.040]  that are still doing well have federal state and local and corporations as
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:20.960]  well looting everyone there's an article up on info wars.com feds laugh at
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:25.200]  applaud theft of private land they actually say we steal money that's a
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:29.880]  quote we always take it for less than it's worth take it and they sit there
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:35.280]  bragging giving each other basically awards at the ceremony from the BLM and
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:40.040]  man folks you go on federal land now which supposedly our land and they'll
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.440]  just walk right up to what do you do and you'll be standing there with your
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:45.280]  kids you're just standing there by a river and you're like we're just throwing
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:49.680]  rocks on water lot of over there I'm gonna search you and they just look at
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:54.240]  you like they hate you and you're like it's not the main park rangers it's the
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:58.080]  police and people say well I thought you don't want to bash the police local
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:01.640]  police compared to federal police are just night and day and there are some
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:06.160]  bad cops seems like the more Democrat in area Chicago New York DC I mean the
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:11.160]  cops have treated me like I I had murdered their children for no reason I
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:15.640]  mean and they treat everybody else like total crap and it's this attitude and I'm
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:19.560]  not making it partisan it's just a fact that I've noticed this out of these
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:24.720]  people they see you as their property they want big poor dumb-down populations
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:29.400]  living hand-to-mouth that they can then have a bunch of assistance that they
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:32.920]  then control that goes to you they skim off the top like there are a lot of good
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:36.600]  foster parents but there's the known gimmick of you know people that
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:40.360]  warehouse kids and barely feed them and then basically just make a living off
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:44.560]  foster kids and so it's people milking the system and the systems coming down
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:47.960]  so of course they want more illegal aliens pouring into the country so they
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:51.080]  can then service all of them Leigh Ann McAdoo you're gonna be joining us for
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:54.520]  about 15 minutes at the end of the next hour before we go into the fourth hour
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:58.680]  today with more updates but what else have you witnessed since you got into
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:03.320]  Michigan yesterday well just some of the things that we have heard from locals
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.280]  people have been warning me on Twitter and other things to just be really
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:10.600]  careful here because this is a very dangerous city and that's kind of one
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:13.480]  of these things that you know people got to understand as people start getting
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:18.120]  more desperate they've got nothing to lose and they're gonna come after those
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:21.280]  people that they see are taking advantage of them these elite you know
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:24.760]  that's one thing Michael Moore he's right about there's no way that they
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:28.360]  would have said here you go Ann Arbor Michigan we're gonna give you this toxic
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:31.480]  waste dump river we're gonna pump it through to your city that never would
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:35.960]  have flown in that town so when you are subjecting a certain amount of people
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:40.040]  that have nothing left to lose they're gonna come after you and no amount of
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:44.240]  safe space that you have built for yourself you're literally gonna have to
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:47.480]  go fly over to New Zealand to protect yourself from these people who are gonna
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:52.000]  get very angry and we're starting to see that happening in these cities that are
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.080]  becoming super desperate but again the cities are collapsing it's not the
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:00.920]  governor's job in my view and I agree with what you're saying so they're
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.880]  blabbering the governor when the governor's telling the Democrat you know
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:10.240]  pimp lords the Democrat plantation commanders you know the Grand Wizards
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:14.440]  over there they're telling them hey it's your city it's your county you're
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:18.680]  supposed to run the water district not us and now here comes the feds to save
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:22.640]  the day they're not gonna save the day right well think about it I mean was the
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:26.480]  mayor of Detroit that was like had to be put in prison and that was the part of
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:31.200]  the issue here was that Detroit was making them pay like some of the highest
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:36.520]  water prices in the nation so they wanted to get off Detroit's water so
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:40.000]  Detroit kind of bugged them and said well you know what we're gonna cancel our
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.120]  contract with you how do you like that so I mean it's just a whole thuggish
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:48.960]  game here and the people are the ones who are suffering well that's it I mean
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:52.760]  let's say it you know you had all these Germans Poles black Americans you name
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:55.960]  it that moved in there in the last hundred years the industrial revolution
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:01.040]  Henry Ford it became a big boom town then the mafia moved in organized
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:05.360]  crime the unions and they took it over and that's just how it runs and as far
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:08.480]  as I'm concerned and I've talked to Michiganders they're great people
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:12.920]  Detroit and Flint aren't part of the state they're gone you go where else
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:16.160]  it's nice people are doing great it's wonderful you go there it's a bunch of
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:21.440]  just you know thug kingpins feeding off their people and that's the end of it
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:25.400]  and of course this is what you need to expect like Mexico it's collapsing right
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:29.000]  and and you have people that do have some money coming back in and trying to
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.800]  reinvigorate the area but that's because they can buy buildings for $200 well
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:39.320]  they also get federal funds right just like the green energy just came it's
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:42.440]  not bringing green energy it's to give boondoggles to their buddies go ahead
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:46.400]  Leigh Ann yeah and to just bring people into a complete waste town who are
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:49.960]  gonna try and revitalize an area but the people around them they don't have
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:53.280]  jobs they don't have money and now they're gonna be dealing with lead
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:57.560]  poisoning for decades and of course lead poisoning not only does it cause cause
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:02.640]  nerve damage but it also cause tons of behavioral problems violence so you know
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.440]  you think this is a criminal city now a violent city now where we see really high
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:11.720]  murder and assault rates and theft I mean imagine in ten years from now when
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:16.520]  these kids grow up and they have the actual effects of lead poisoning which
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:22.000]  is going to only exacerbate that kind of behavior well here's the bottom line
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.280]  there's a lot of things happening here the country's rotting it's falling apart
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:30.440]  they have corrupt politicians in the area but people don't have the survival
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:34.160]  instinct because they've been raised on welfare raised in the system in the area
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.760]  black and white it's very poor area and one of the highest welfare rates in the
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.960]  country they don't know how to leave they don't have family in other areas they
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:47.080]  need to leave they need to get out you know Latin America is collapsing and at
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:50.840]  least those folks are smart enough to try to get out of it I don't blame them the
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:53.960]  problem is they're being brought here and turn into political weapons so folks
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:59.200]  need to learn how to leave that's what people need to do Flint needs to
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:04.760]  disappear people need to leave it's toxic it's out of control it's a hundred
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:10.520]  year old industrial site it's over yeah and actually this county Genesee County
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:14.280]  is one of the first anti-slavery establishment so this was one of the
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:18.360]  first places that a lot of black people came and they found all sorts of jobs
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:23.120]  here and this place really was booming and you look around at some of the home
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:27.080]  some of the architecture it's beautiful beautiful and so you can only
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:31.520]  imagine how it must have been back in the day before this got turned into a
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:37.040]  welfare state what happened what happened when you happen to me exactly in
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:41.520]  the Union's happening and of course folks were smart in the South who were
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.400]  being abused and the economy wasn't good period for anybody they left see the
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.080]  black folks went from the south to the north now it's bad again it's time to
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:55.960]  go back to the south amen that's what I'm saying it's it's you can't save how
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:00.960]  far gone these buildings are the lead pipes that are eroded that are killing
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:05.160]  your people like it's it's done all right Lee and we're gonna talk to you

[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:01.680]  some of the governor's office member of the Dixie mafia later learns that the
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:05.840]  heads of the Dixie mafia run the Clintons and the way the mafia works he
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:09.160]  knows the heads work that's how this stuff really works and of course they
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:15.560]  were CIA right out of college that's been declassified now the question is will
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:20.400]  Biden come in now Trump today and I have the article I'll pull it out is
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:24.640]  basically saying exactly what Larry Nichols said three months ago here on
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:28.840]  the air Trump Biden would run if Clinton indicted and calls him a ghost
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:35.280]  candidate that's out of MSNBC and Politico but he's got inside baseball from
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:40.760]  his big political contacts on where the movement is right now Larry Nichols
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:43.840]  thank you for coming on my friend you look good I know you've been battling
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:47.040]  illness but I tell you look better than you looked a few months ago so I hope
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:51.360]  folks prayers are working out there thank you for coming on that well thank
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:55.320]  you you know Alex it's heading up just like we said you know just like we've
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:44:02.520]  talked about buddy let me tell you the inside scoop Biden and Elizabeth Warren
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:09.080]  they're ready they've got their staff set up there they're ready to go now but
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:15.920]  here's the problem Alex Hillary Hillary is putting the pressure on them they
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:22.240]  indict her and Alex she's gonna unload on everybody and has made it quite
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:31.240]  plain you indict me and every secret in Washington will be revealed I will not
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:36.720]  go down alone and every member of Congress both Republican and Democrat
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:42.880]  there's Senate they're scared to death they're begging Obama don't and of
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:50.800]  course Obama's got his agenda and it's the battle it's the battle now I know
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:54.200]  everybody Alex tells you well Hillary's got to be indicted got to be
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:45:00.720]  indicted let me tell you she gets indicted it's over Washington as we know
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:07.620]  it will be over and the people there know it justice be done justice be done
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:13.360]  may the heavens fall because the open naked corruption unprecedented and her
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:18.400]  not getting in trouble is causing a giant awakening so any way you look at
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:23.640]  it this is a no-win situation what do you expect the establishment to do what's
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:31.080]  the current movement what direction are they going in well there's absolutely now
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:35.880]  I got that just just this morning people the high ups in the Democratic Party are
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:40.200]  calling me my god what are we gonna do Republican hives are calling me my god
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:45.920]  what are we gonna do let me tell you everybody is frozen everyone's frozen
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:54.640]  Alex Hillary has got that city under fear it's under the greatest terrorist
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:46:01.000]  attack that's ever been known to Washington DC she has and so people in
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.960]  America wondering well wait a minute with all this stuff that's so obvious how
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:10.240]  can you not indict her and so there's pressure from that angle the Republican
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:14.640]  party to be quite honest the reason there's not a lot of stuff happening you
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:19.320]  know between Trump crews and the establishment in the Republican Party
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:25.200]  everybody quite honestly is sitting tight but puckered what is gonna happen
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:28.800]  and so I'm telling you they're not gonna endide Hillary they're not gonna endide
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:35.240]  her because if they do she is going to reveal everything about every one of them
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:39.120]  and well as you know a lot of former federal prosecutors and others are
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:42.880]  coming out saying the word is an FBI indictment is imminent in the next 40 to
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:47.800]  50 days is that just smoking mirrors that's just well that's just wishful
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:51.200]  thinking there's a lot of people that think they know this and they think they
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:55.520]  know that and there's no doubt that there's FBI guys Alex you know they're
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:01.240]  not bad they're not all bad they want to endider but they can't see can't endide
[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:04.640]  Hillary unless you get Loretta Lynch to do it Loretta Lynch not gonna do it unless
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:09.240]  Obama tells her now what about Biden you you said you talked to some big
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:14.960]  insiders and they've even lined up who they plan to run with him right
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:19.960]  Biden and Elizabeth Warren that's what they think will be the relief team the
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:26.160]  dream team if Henry goes down they can bring him in problem is the Debbie
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:31.400]  Wasserman Schultz or whatever her name is she's she's fighting hard they've even
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:35.400]  changed the rules now they're gonna have another debate everybody's working to
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:40.120]  try to get Hillary back on track because you're scared to death I'm telling you
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:44.640]  this is this is this is big league this is big time now six months ago you were
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:49.480]  saying we got to take out Hillary politically but you warned Obama may
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:57.080]  try to put his dynasty in of Biden that's now admitted so but again I mean
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:00.200]  they're they're part of the same structure but two different heads I
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:04.680]  would say in your gut which way is this leaning or are you saying right now it's
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:09.000]  a stalemate this is still made but I'm just telling you right now Hillary will
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.320]  not be indicted they will do everything they can to try to cover it up they'll
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:17.960]  do everything they can to try to rebuild her campaign and remember a lot of this
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:22.080]  is gonna work out to Hillary's favor in the general election because come general
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:27.080]  election time when she wins it's all gonna be old news and she's gonna talk
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:32.840]  about Alex how the right wing white guy conspiracy how they tried to bring
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:37.200]  charges against her how they've done everything to destroy her and she still
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:41.920]  made it like the phoenix rising up from the ashes she made it and here she
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:46.400]  comes now I will say this the only one that can be Hillary Alex the only one
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:53.040]  is Donald Trump Donald Trump he's the only one that will be able to mix it up
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:57.800]  with Hillary well Roger Stone the operations to go after the rape and
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:01.960]  abuse of women it seems to be working quite nicely and is damaging her with
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:08.320]  women it is it won't it won't stop her it won't stop her Alex remember this
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:14.040]  whole election is about people that are committed that you could you could catch
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:18.960]  Hillary rape and women herself right on TV and there are people that are gonna
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:23.120]  vote for they're not gonna vote against her then you've got the people that
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:27.560]  would rather vote for the devil himself than to vote for Republican and then
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:31.240]  you've got the people that would rather do whatever than vote for Donald Trump so
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:36.280]  you've got this this is the showdown Alex this is that this is the election
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:42.160]  that our country's up for grabs right now and that's why we've got to get in
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:47.480]  we the average American and I'll say it the average American white guy you know
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:52.960]  we're being excluded from the whole thing you know we're the dinosaur we're
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:57.440]  the ones that are the endangered species sure it's the broken coalition strategy
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:01.520]  that you use to get them into the good editorial office they've now done where
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:04.640]  the minorities were walled off before and they played politics now it's the
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.080]  other way around and people are saying good get the old white guy it's not
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:11.680]  gonna screw the white guy over it's a bunch of rich white guys offshore running
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:15.160]  the whole scam they just don't want middle-class people period that happened
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:19.840]  to be a lot of white to have a say anymore that's right I mean they want
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:24.120]  us out of the picture Alex remember what I told you they want the evil Western
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:29.520]  culture that that that's here you know of a free market and profit gone they
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:31.600]  want a monopoly now and they're and they're and they're getting ready to
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:39.120]  do it that's right so you know guys please engage this time this will be and
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:42.880]  I think you see Alex everything I've warned about coming to pass just like
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:47.960]  a bolt of lightning everything is everybody now is saying this is yet
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:52.200]  everybody can feel it they can see it the planets are aligning what about a
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:56.440]  wild car she looks you know ill she looks old then she looks like she's on
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:51:00.440]  drugs once she's at the debates I mean you know maybe God will intercede here
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:05.040]  and you know she'll show working I'm working with a story that I probably
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:08.800]  shouldn't tell so I want that the National Enquirer's fixing to do a story
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:12.360]  coming out about Hillary's mental capacity and whether or not she is
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:16.440]  mentally ill so that'll be coming out now of course let me stop you twice in the
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:19.960]  last six months you said the inquires doing a story on this and then it comes
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:24.160]  out obviously you're talking to him so since you said it tell us they're
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:27.800]  looking at her mental capacity right they are they really are she's got
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:32.120]  health issues and they're going back and asking me and others that have known
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:37.080]  her since the beginning what what is it about Hillary and Hillary Alex has had
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:42.360]  a mental issue since day one she can't she does not like people she is an animal
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:47.240]  she's everything I've told you she is and it is a mental problem and that's
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:51.360]  what's causing her trouble running this election to be quite honest you can't
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:57.200]  make her a people person you just can't do it and so that's where we're at but
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:01.400]  there's going to be stories about that but remember none of these things are
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:06.360]  going to hurt Hillary none I'm sorry well then what will stop me that way what
[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:12.760]  will stop her and and how can Trump crush her what'll stop her is me they
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:19.280]  know it I know it what'll help is Donald Trump you see Donald Trump can save the
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:23.800]  nation Donald Trump can make a part of his campaign which I think he will or
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:29.400]  can and that is to issue the power back to the states I think if Donald Trump
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:34.400]  gets in and runs that as his platform he has a chance of he'd be like George
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:37.720]  Washington when they wanted to make him king refusing if he returned the
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:41.000]  republic returned the power to the states said let's let's you know get rid
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.320]  of the 17th amendment where the senators aren't part of the states if he did
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:49.120]  that he'd be George Washington part two he would and you're just gonna have to
[01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:53.560]  leave Hillary to me you know it's like I've told you for 20 years Alex this is
[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:59.640]  the feature match between me and the bitch and all I can say is I'll be there
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:05.000]  I'll be there when it's time the main thing I've got to do right now guys and
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:10.200]  I'm telling you and you see the complexity now Alex of the Obama the
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:15.760]  Hillary the Washington how it's all entangled right now Hillary and Bill the
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:21.800]  power they have is stopping Obama from triggering a crisis that puts us under
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:25.800]  provisional government which makes him king we've got to get through that
[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:32.680]  period which is what we're doing right now and then it'll be up to us and then
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:38.520]  what I have and you know what I have will come out well I don't want to get
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:41.600]  killed by a black ops team I don't know specifically what you got I don't know
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:44.760]  all of it right I know you have a bunch of dirt on her and you've been a source
[01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:48.480]  of a lot of it over the years coming out and I guess you're still alive the way
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:52.360]  she is I guess you've got it to save places or why are you still alive well
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:56.560]  I'm still alive because they know they know that I've got it stashed away in
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:01.680]  five places anything happens to me it comes out instantly and the fact that
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:07.800]  something happens to me if I die of this unique accident Arkansas if you will
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:12.080]  it'll give credence well Larry you sure you were the guy behind the Clinton
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:14.520]  Chronicles all of it for folks that are politically ignorant don't know who you
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:19.480]  are you are a very important person I know you're not bluffing about this but
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:22.600]  you might be overestimating because who knows how powerful any of us are in the
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:26.200]  corruption today right he says you can be raping kids in the White House launch
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:29.320]  you wouldn't get in trouble for it whether mentally ill cult followers but
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:32.440]  you know you've said in interviews I know you were Green Beret I know you work
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:36.920]  for the Clintons high level you know that you particularly have you know we're a
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:42.760]  guy that took care of things for him is that the dirt part of it yes I'm just
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:46.680]  gonna tell you so you know where dead bodies are buried you bet and I know
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:51.920]  this I know everything is going to key around something called Vince Foster
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:58.200]  there is something about the Vince Foster investigation that will put
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:04.800]  Hillary down now don't remember what I've told you if I had her pulling the
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:07.920]  trigger for Vince Foster it's not gonna get her indicted right if they're not
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:12.320]  gonna indict her over this email scandal they're not gonna indict her over
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:16.480]  that but there's a trick I know remember Alex I helped build the system that's
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:20.440]  getting them elected keeping them elected I helped build that thing I helped
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:26.800]  design that thing and there's things I can do remember hey got Bill Clinton
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:33.800]  impeached and it was much harder then because nobody knew I was think about
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:40.080]  Alex were you and I came from back in those days I mean it's tough but it's
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:44.520]  not impossible like that was well back then nobody knew who David Shippers was
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:48.800]  or anything and Drudge was helping to get the word out without Drudge and the
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:52.080]  Western Journalism Center and you and a few others now people are a lot more I'd
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:55.560]  say a thousand times more away that's really got a threat in the system even
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:59.920]  of in closing I know you are fighting cancer you don't want folks to know about
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:03.800]  it they've destroyed you financially you've also had some dirty tricks done
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:07.200]  to you lately I'm gonna get into it all but you got a PayPal account for folks
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:10.480]  that want to help you with your medical bills to keep you alive look let's put

[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:43.320]  communist form of government there will be no doubt you know it's funny she's
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:47.800]  running against Bernie Sanders who's a socialist and it makes her look like
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:52.400]  she's to the right let me tell you when Hillary gets elected two things will
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:57.360]  happen immediately we will be reformed organizationally like you've seen
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:02.000]  Obama do she will reform us as a communist nation number one number two she
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.360]  will put Bill Clinton in the UN as our ambassador and within six months he'll

[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:51.560]  clowered and piven type strategy where they have a amalgamation of communism and
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:58.320]  fascism absorbing what was left of free market capitalism in americana and
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:04.440]  western culture and renaissance and so the elites are offshore in a trifecta
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:09.880]  above the communism above the fascism above the nation states exempt from all
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:14.720]  the regulations and rules with diplomatic immunity on record playing
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:18.680]  everyone off against each other I mean how could they not take the world over
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:24.840]  it's an ingenious plan but only in the public is financially culturally
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:30.560]  spiritually geopolitically as ignorant as a goldfish with the memory of a
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:34.600]  goldfish fact I believe our new national symbol actually I thought a lot
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:39.840]  about this should it be a buzzard eating dead meat should it be a guy's you know
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:44.040]  TSA sticking their hand you know down your pants and actually I don't I think
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:49.920]  it should be a goldfish goofy stupid ineffectual doesn't mean anything and
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:58.240]  has about 30 second 30 second understanding of the world and I'm
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:05.680]  really feel bad having to admit how far we've fallen but you have to do that
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:08.640]  before you turn things around you have to have a total rejection of the system
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:17.000]  and you've got just flagrant explosive tectonic colossal violent
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:24.320]  hemorrhaging stinking mountains of corruption just flooding out and nobody
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:29.200]  gets in trouble we have all this new BLM footage just up on info wars.com

[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:43.960]  snicker just like in surveillance footage and stuff you see of criminals
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:46.920]  robbing a bank everybody's tied up no just pistol lips somebody for no
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:52.680]  reason and make jokes and you know this is their attitude I mean this is who

[02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:10.400]  potential first husband Bill Clinton has failed miserably as women have crawled
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:14.400]  out of the woodwork to describe his detailed history of sexual abuse she
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:18.480]  also has the looming email scandal which doesn't seem to go away no matter how
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:22.040]  many jokes she throws at it the latest news comes out of Beaumont where only
[02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:25.840]  six people were at the airport to greet the former first lady KDFM reported
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:29.600]  that she didn't say hello or visit any of those six people she does drove away

[02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:06.160]  Jones
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:39.760]  Well, a fighter wing of fighter bombers has been moved to Japan to face the
[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:45.520]  communist Chinese. The British government has come out in squirrely
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:52.000]  leveled blame for the radiation poisoning a decade ago of a former KGB
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:57.080]  officer that's they get new sanctions. We have a stack of news here about radical
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:01.480]  jihadis raping stabbing killing aid workers running around foaming at the
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:06.040]  mouth governments banning speech against them across Europe. I mean we are
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:10.200]  definitely in the hands of some very sadistic wicked crazy people that hate
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:13.320]  us. They're called communists, they're called socialists that work for big
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:17.080]  megabanks who are above the law and tax exempt and are meeting right now high
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:21.520]  the top the highest resort in Switzerland Davos and with the breakdown on what's
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:25.480]  happening inside Davos with the breakdown on what's going on geopolitically
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:31.000]  infowars.com reporter Wayne Madsen he also has Wayne Madsen report.com he's
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.040]  also a best-selling author find his books there he's gonna be covering a lot
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:37.680]  of the election in fact I think I'm gonna try to send him to the RNC and the NC
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:41.200]  we're getting accredited right now I'll probably go to some of those as well
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:44.600]  along with David Knight and Jakari Jackson Lee and Matthew and some of the
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:49.080]  other crew this year but and of course our political correspondent Richard
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:52.640]  Reeves up in Iowa who's been popping in I mean we're building a real news
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:56.920]  organization here and Wayne Madsen form of the NSA of course and also written
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:01.360]  for Miami Herald you name it some of the biggest newspapers in the country I'm
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:06.200]  not gonna go over all of those but the two big articles that I saw and the
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:10.600]  reason I wanted to get him on today was one yesterday on infowars.com and now
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:16.480]  today report globalist covering up jihadist violence international agreement
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:20.280]  between some nations to downplay migrant crisis yeah they're agreeing not to
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:25.360]  report it I mean it really shows this how they use political correctness to
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:30.080]  cover up an attempt to genocide against cultures report US harbors ISIS link
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:36.680]  terrorist US changes status of ISIS link group to protected organization well
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:39.880]  of course they've been running the whole thing but how does it break that
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:43.280]  narrative when somebody like Donald Trump comes out and talks about it look
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:47.320]  how far we've come from Wayne and I talked about the Syrian Civil War five
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:51.760]  years ago starting Western backed and al-Nusra being al-Qaeda to today we're
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:55.840]  not called conspiracy theorist well Wayne's been to Damascus he's been over
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:11:00.280]  there during the Civil War he's been to Libya so you know that's what these
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:03.640]  journalists do is actually get on the ground not just repeat what the White
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:08.280]  House says so so much is going on the global markets are melting down as soon
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:11.640]  as Soros came out three weeks ago and said the plunge is here everyone
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:16.180]  dutifully started the plunge because it's staged and they now admit that three
[02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:20.120]  years ago in Rolling Stone and the New York Times okay the stock markets
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:24.000]  rigged okay the currency rates are rigged okay the interest rates are rigged
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:29.120]  with LIBOR what a world now though where I thought they'd all go to jail for it
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:33.440]  or something might stop instead they have BLM meetings and forestry meetings
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:39.080]  where they go we steal money in houses we're proud of it I mean again it's like
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:41.920]  cartoons when I was a kid that would show the legion of doom having an award
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:46.640]  ceremony and giving criminals awards and I thought and people doing horrible
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:50.320]  things awards and I thought that's ridiculous but the more I grow up I see
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:55.520]  I go wait whoever wrote that knew what they were talking about I mean let's
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:12:00.240]  give Obama five more peace prizes I mean what a sick world Wayne I kind of set
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:05.000]  the table here for the hour on how crazy everything's getting just generally on
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.720]  the state of the world and where you see it going and just all of it and then
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:13.960]  we'll drill into Davos drill into the jihadis and the rest of it but first
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:16.760]  off happy new year great to have you here with us as you've already been on
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:20.880]  since the year started but here we are my friend
[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:26.800]  Ian is going to turn out to be a very interesting year both domestically and
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:34.440]  internationally you mentioned the latest report which was commissioned by the
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:38.400]  British it was another one of these British judges they hold out of the
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:43.280]  old Bailey in London you know that's a place at V you know and V for Vendetti
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:48.800]  blew it up but they hold some judge out who came up with said that oh Vladimir
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:55.160]  Putin killed this guy Litmanenko when it clearly it's it was all signs pointed to
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:13:01.440]  Litmanenko's employer a guy named Boris Berejovsky being responsible getting
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:07.040]  rid of Litmanenko because Litmanenko was probably a double agent and he wanted
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:11.440]  to get rid of him because Litmanenko found out too much about this Berejovsky
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:17.400]  he was an exiled Russian oligarch who had been the king of all Russian media at
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:22.600]  one point in time and like many of these oligarchs like Kodorkovsky and Edgeland
[02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:27.240]  they all hightailed out of Russia because they owed taxes and this guy was
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:31.480]  pretty low level they've made such a big deal for 10 years now squarely blaming
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:35.640]  it on Putin and I read the report no evidence no nothing why haven't the
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:39.360]  Russians come out then and said he was our double agent why do they have this
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:43.680]  policy of never even defending themselves well I mean it gets into the
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:47.600]  intelligence thing because if they admit it to that you know he had he had
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:52.560]  infiltrated the Chechen movement for example the exile Chechens abroad now
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:59.760]  this is the same movement that spawned Tamerlin and Jokar Sarnayev the two
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:04.800]  accused bombers and the Boston Marathon bombing so you know the Russians had a
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:10.360]  lot of intelligence on them too all of it which was ignored by our FBI I would
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:15.600]  add and also the Obama administration but but they try to say that because
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:20.400]  there was traces of Polonium being left all over London because this guy
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:26.000]  Litvinenko supposedly ate some radioactive sushi that was sprinkled
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:30.400]  with Polonium dust in some Japanese restaurant in London that that by the
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:34.800]  way that same Polonium was found in Berezovsky's office you know that the
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:39.680]  British debt now this is the same British line of inquiry that ruled that
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:45.720]  Dr. David Kelly the WMD expert actually committed suicide that he wasn't
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:50.880]  murdered everybody in England knows he was murdered this is the same judicial
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:56.120]  line of inquiry that said that there was nothing to the Tony Blair dodgy dossier
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:15:00.640]  these are the people that covered up the pedophile scandal that goes all the way to Prince Charles
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:04.760]  they covered that up the whole so why should we believe anything out of some
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:12.680]  British wanker judge that comes out with some some report you know reports are a
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:17.320]  diamond dozen in Britain and they're easily paid for as we've seen with
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:20.680]  about ten of them well obviously it getting major attraction is just a way
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:24.240]  to demonize Russia and accelerate tensions are they gonna be successful
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:28.000]  kicking off a new Cold War seems like the American people and Donald Trump and
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.840]  everybody else just don't want to have bad relations with Russia and are sick of
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:39.480]  all this yeah I mean you know Russia and now we've got the the sabers being
[02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:45.120]  rattled against China I would note that I saw a photograph of the Australian
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:50.520]  Prime Minister Turnbull being entertained by the commander of US Pacific forces
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:55.480]  in Pearl Harbor they had a photo off outside the admiral's home I noticed
[02:15:55.480 --> 02:16:00.600]  that the admiral didn't have his cover on his his headgear and what's
[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:04.640]  happened to the Navy that guy was out of uniform when I was an officer we could
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:09.680]  never or any no no Navy person could be outside without a cover so he decides
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:14.040]  to ditch his cover so he can get a photo off because he was trying to tell
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:18.560]  Australian Prime Minister look the Chinese are gonna turn the Pacific into
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:24.600]  a Chinese lake you know we got to get to battle stations and rev up for a war
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:29.120]  with the Chinese I mean how retro can you get with these I can understand why
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:32.760]  the admiral would be pushing that because he you know that he's looking to
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:38.360]  get a job with Lockheed Martin after he retires so the more money if we have a
[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:43.240]  nuclear war well you know the look the history of Pearl Harbor and admiral's
[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:48.120]  isn't one that I would put on my resume they have a pretty bad history over
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:54.280]  there when they should be worried about wars they aren't they got they got hit
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:58.880]  with the Japanese attack and winter they shouldn't be worried about wars they're
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:02.920]  they're beating the war drums they're you know they spent so much time well we
[02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:07.840]  know the truth the admiral stood down sure but we know the truth they stood
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:11.040]  down to get us into the war not defending the Japanese but that we set
[02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:15.120]  them up sent the carriers out and you know the Spanish-American war in 1898
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:20.240]  that was a false flag with a sinking of the main yeah and and of course on
[02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:26.840]  December 7 1941 all of Admiral Harris's you know predecessors over there were
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:31.240]  you know sleeping off a hangover from Saturday night nothing never changes in
[02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:37.320]  Pearl Harbor I'm afraid well it is pretty now expanding on this now before
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:40.320]  you enter the radical Islamists and what's behind that and the flooding of
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:42.800]  Europe and the rest of the world with them and some of the interesting
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:46.760]  discoveries you found about US harboring ISIS groups inside the US and this
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:50.840]  should be a national story and hopefully listeners can make it once we can force
[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:56.720]  some sunlight on this election 2016 Hillary how much trouble she in you
[02:17:56.720 --> 02:18:00.440]  think they'll really run Biden with Elizabeth Warren or what's the intel
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:05.880]  Wayne Madsen's got on that right now well the DNC is getting they're getting
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:11.040]  nervous about Hillary the you mentioned earlier the email scandals not going
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:14.360]  away now turns out that she had higher than top secret that's that's
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:18.600]  compartment and information and people have gone to jail for long periods of
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:24.640]  time when they misuse that type but trust it far less yeah even even even stuff
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:29.560]  that's not compartmented people have gone to a prison for a long time so that
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:32.880]  that's a festering sore that's not going away I'll tell you there's also a
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:37.680]  documentary out called wiener about Anthony wiener and apparently there's
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:43.400]  some really awkward information in there about Hillary Clinton and her long-time
[02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:50.640]  assistant wieners wife Huma Abedin well many years ago I happened to have been
[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:58.000]  in Hollywood well up in Beverly Hills when the Hillary was there was a three
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:03.400]  day weekend it was actually the Columbus Day weekend and the rumors were rampant
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:08.280]  around Hollywood and Beverly Hills about what Hillary was doing out there at the
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:12.960]  Beverly Hills Hotel I let people's imagination figure out the rest of that
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:16.240]  story but I think that's when they say this movie's awkward that's what they're
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:20.020]  talking about yes there's an awkward there's an awkward situation with
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:26.400]  Hillary's marriage as it is with whom Abedin's marriage to Anthony wiener so
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:30.440]  there you go ladies and gentlemen looking at the Islamic situation Wayne
[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:34.560]  Madsen which should we tackle first when we come back report US Harbor's ISIS
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:38.200]  link terrorist or do you want to hit report globalist covering up jihadist
[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:43.680]  violence well I think that that's the one that is really of immediate concern
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:47.760]  for people in Europe now we can get it the other one segues easily into the
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:52.400]  other story all right Wayne Madsen stay there I'm Alex Jones you're watching the

[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:13.680]  leader not the type of reporters we have at infowars.com we analyze breaking news
[02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:18.640]  we cover other people's breaking stories we're not in competition with the rest
[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:24.240]  of the media we're in competition with media that lies to expose them and more
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:28.320]  and more the news we cover what we focus on is becoming with talking points
[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:31.880]  around the country in the world that shows how weak the establishment media
[02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:35.000]  has gotten I'll talk about that more coming up in the next segment if you've
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:42.240]  got questions for Wayne Madson on any subject we'll take a few calls 800-259-9231
[02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:50.400]  200-259-9231 going back to Wayne before he leaves us he'll be with us with
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:53.080]  Mackie was well at the end of the hour we're gonna look at what's happening in
[02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:58.560]  Flint but later it's all part of this overall breakdown of the civilization
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:03.600]  but also breakdown in trust in the system I don't want to not have trust in a
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:08.120]  system but you can't trust a predatory system it has to die even though that's
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:14.600]  going to be painful I want a social compact I'm not an anarchist but what
[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:22.520]  we have is totally unequivocal and if you look at Davos with the richest people
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:25.240]  in the world that have half the world's wealth almost all of them got it
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:30.400]  through inside government contract deals crony deals lecturing the free market
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:34.520]  that it did something to destroy what's left of it and transfer the money
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:40.480]  themselves while flooding Europe and the United States with unskilled workers
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:45.280]  and radical jihadists obviously destabilization is the plan but do they
[02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:51.920]  think we're really this dumb to go along with it or is it such a will to to
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:55.800]  break our back that that they just don't care Wayne Wayne Madson I'm kind of
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:59.920]  ranting here but but this ties into your report in fact we'll cover more of the
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:04.920]  Islamic stuff in a moment Davos I mean these guys really are the bad guys
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:09.000]  meeting as you've exposed and they're just so arrogant up there lecturing
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.080]  Westerners on how we're not paying enough taxes and how we're the reason
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:17.920]  there's inequity when it's the elite are the authors of it well I look at the
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:23.160]  where they're meeting in Davos and you got you know snow drenched mountains
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:28.160]  all around that village and if there was ever a need for a Navalanche I can't
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:35.400]  think of a better time than now but yeah I mean this is the Davos and Bilderberg
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:40.960]  and you know these people they love to get together and and plot behind these
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:48.640]  closed doors at these these she she resort areas and they lecture the rest
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:52.400]  of the world the rest is sure that George Soros is there he wouldn't miss a
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:57.680]  Davos meeting and probably that weasel Henry Kissinger has been wheeled in
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:02.960]  there in his wheelchair from his private jet so yeah you've got all these
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:07.520]  insidious players maybe maybe maybe even David Rockefeller at a hundred years
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:13.560]  old is somewhere shaking in the corner somewhere but yeah they're
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:18.600]  disgusting people they don't have any relation to the real world yet they
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:23.560]  what the decisions they make affect the entire planet and Bilderberg group and
[02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:27.080]  Davos member Peter Sutherland that heads up the UN program on migration he
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:31.600]  admits he's opening the borders to quote in the culture of Europe well they're
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:34.920]  gonna do that why not bring people in from you know like I said Brazil or
[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:38.200]  something that you know aren't wanting around and to put bags on women's heads
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:43.080]  and murder everyone why are they in a love affair with radical jihadis you
[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:48.360]  know sometimes it's it doesn't even pay to try to psychoanalyze these people and
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:53.840]  they may just be in fact they may be insane they often talk about the
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:28:00.440]  insanity of the Nazi regime in Germany and and if there was insanity there why
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:04.440]  can't there be insanity with these people undoubtedly I mean why would Soros
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:09.200]  go on 16 minutes and say I'm not ashamed of being a Nazi collaborator yeah that's
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:13.360]  an exact quote that's mental illness because he's not even ashamed of it he
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:17.360]  should at least say he's ashamed even if he isn't well and Henry Kissinger saying
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:22.440]  power is the ultimate aphrodisiac I mean what what normal person would say
[02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:27.440]  things like that yeah these these people are probably clinically insane
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:32.560]  however they've got a lot of influence they got a lot of money and and you know
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:38.280]  and the media is over there you know the media always sends their top you know
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:43.320]  their marquee reporters go and Leonardo DiCaprio they're all fawning over him
[02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:48.800]  oh yeah I mean and anybody who's anybody over there you know Justin Trudeau is
[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:53.000]  he's he's over there because he's recently been elected Prime Minister
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:29:00.200]  of Canada this fascist in Argentina Mauricio Macri who's now like the generals
[02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:05.320]  during the dirty war of the 1970s is starting to put his political opponents
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:10.760]  in jail you know Obama never congratulated many Latin American leaders
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:15.920]  because a lot of them don't like Obama or but he sure couldn't wait to
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:20.080]  congratulate Macri the minute he was elected president Argentina very close
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:28.000]  race back in November so Obama's who used to basically monitor Latin American
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:33.280]  business activities for the CIA with his job at business international
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:37.600]  corporation you know you don't you don't get these leopards to change their
[02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:43.440]  spots he's still Obama's still likes to be dealing with these oligarchs and stay
[02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:46.880]  there I want to come back and actually get into the articles global is covering
[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:52.120]  up jihad violence we're on the March the empires on the run prison planet Alex
[02:29:52.120 --> 02:29:56.480]  coms on the GCN radio network
[02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:02.840]  in early January the hermit nation of North Korea announced that it had
[02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:06.960]  successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb this would make the fourth successful
[02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:10.760]  test that the isolated nation has claimed analysts at the time said this was
[02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:15.000]  Kim Jong-un and a display of saber rattling to mark his birthday and to
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:18.720]  highlight a rare ruling party congress scheduled for May the first gathering of
[02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:23.720]  its kind in 35 years but just yesterday Fox News reported that US diplomats have
[02:30:23.720 --> 02:30:27.680]  stepped up pressure on China to play a leading role in punishing North Korea for
[02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:31.480]  its most recent test the US is also stepping up its military presence in

[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:12.680]  really paying attention now but but looking at the radical Islamist
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:16.480]  invasion this is really getting people to pay attention let's get into your
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:21.520]  articles here report globalist cover-up jihadist violence European deals to
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:26.280]  cover it up and then how that ties into ISIS linked groups being protected by
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:33.560]  Obama in America unprecedented well since the report about the cover-up in
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:39.160]  Europe we have yet a later report out of Sweden that the Swedish police have been
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:45.440]  ordered to classify as if it's national security information all incidents
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:50.920]  involving migrants in Sweden and that that would be sexual assaults against
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:58.680]  women and any other petty crime so this is a pattern we saw it in Germany first
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:05.320]  with the cover-up of the New Year's Eve rapes in Cologne and then there were
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:09.520]  additional reports that these similar incidents took place around Germany
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:17.000]  Austria Switzerland and we have Merkel who invited all these migrants in of
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:22.520]  course with the with the encouragement of people like Soros who said Europe can
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:29.080]  actually stand you know to have a few more million of these migrants and and
[02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:34.200]  couple that with the fact that we also had similar incidents with cover-up here
[02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:40.360]  when the guy shot the Philly cop the the the Muslim the Muslim he born in the
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:47.840]  United States Archer the new mayor Philadelphia Kenny he says oh no he's
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:52.920]  not tied up with any Islamic group and then we find out that this guy had
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:58.240]  visited Saudi Arabia he had been in Egypt and and even the Philadelphia police
[02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:03.720]  commissioner said he swore allegiance the Islamic State and we had the mayor
[02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:08.000]  just like that mayor that female mayor rector in Cologne she was covering up
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.640]  over there it looks like mayors everywhere a reading from the same
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:17.680]  choir sheet there was a Muslim attack on a nightclub in Calgary in Canada same
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:22.800]  situation the local police covered it up the Calgary authorities covered up so
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:31.400]  what's going on here just interrupt briefly if you look at this it's clear
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:35.560]  the goals I don't want you to add to this because you always do have points I
[02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:39.200]  don't bring up and angles I didn't think of but bring them in create a new
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:42.880]  political group you control you can have them riot or burn things down like
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:47.400]  Paris or London whenever you want as a distraction you can then ban speech that
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:51.440]  upsets them you can declare civil emergencies as France and Germany and
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:55.040]  others have done to restrict free speech you can beta test getting the police
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:41:00.400]  to cover up crimes under political correctness and corrupting them and then
[02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:03.760]  on so many fronts when people are finally sick of the radical Islamic
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:08.200]  invasion you can point it at innocent Muslim countries that actually aren't
[02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:15.280]  part of it like Iraq aka after 9-11 in Saudi Arabia right and and just and then
[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:19.440]  now we we find out that Facebook has agreed with the German government to
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:26.680]  censor all anti-migrant the comments on Facebook so you know that's gonna happen
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:33.960]  here too eventually because again I think Trump hit the big the biggest
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:39.080]  issue is a sleeper issue I believe and that's Trump's opinion on political
[02:41:39.080 --> 02:41:44.160]  correctness I mean it has gotten way out of hand with the names of things and
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:50.680]  statues people don't like them and and you can I mean even even stand-up
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:56.800]  comics are complaining today because they're gonna infuriate somebody they're
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:01.720]  going to make somebody upset with their with their comedy routines and even
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:09.640]  Hillary complained about one comedy club somewhere there is a attack on this
[02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:13.160]  across the board I want to go to some phone calls on this subject and talk
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:17.240]  about the ISIS group in America as well but first your ISIS connected groups
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:24.280]  let's go to Iran's foreign minister Javad Zafir tells Christina I'm on poor of
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:28.880]  CNN that while Saudi Arabia is panicking the two countries can coexist in the
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:34.560]  region and he points out Saudi Arabia supposedly attacked you on 9-11 not us
[02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:40.000]  so so again they're continuing to point out Saudi Arabia is backing ISIS all of
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:44.080]  this this is really some truth from Iran here it is
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:50.920]  there was unsubstantiated charges 15 of the 19 people who blew up 9-11 were
[02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:56.680]  Saudi citizens people who murdered others in San Bernardino where so just
[02:42:56.680 --> 02:43:03.160]  had just with us a Saudi Arabia but I'm tired of this panicking that Iran is
[02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:07.960]  back in the nation I think we were always in the community of nations now
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:13.680]  their allies have recognized that Iran is a serious partner up until then it was
[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:17.880]  the Saudi allies particularly the United States who was at loggerheads with
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:23.480]  Iran now it hasn't changed but the Saudis are panicking that there may be a
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:28.680]  slight opportunity the tensions between Iran and the West would would reduce and
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:34.680]  that smokescreen that had allowed them to export this Wahhabi ideology of
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:42.000]  extremism to if that smokescreen disappears then people see we'll call
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:45.880]  they spade a state you notice that's good all of this is our talking point I'm
[02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:49.640]  not bragging about info wars in our guest but we put Wahhabis on the map we
[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:53.160]  expose Benghazi with our guest Colonel Schaefer countless others like Wayne
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:57.880]  Madsen and now it's like Donald Trump I know listens is saying stuff he gets
[02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:01.520]  from the show I mean this this and of course MSNBC admits the Republican
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:05.480]  leadership's getting talking points now from info wars and trying to and passing
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:09.480]  bills from the show on on bullet purchasing it's got a really upset the
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:14.640]  system now that people know the West is backing and Saudi Arabia is backing
[02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:19.760]  ISIS Wayne Madsen yeah I just point one thing out about almond poor they sent her
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:24.000]  in there she has a chip on her shoulder with Iran anyway because she's an
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:29.360]  Iranian Christian her family left Iran so I mean so they send her in there with
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:32.760]  a chip on her shoulder she wants some kind of are you looked at her face I
[02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:38.400]  mean to paraphrase Donald Trump look at the face I mean she looks like she just
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:42.520]  took a whip of Limburger cheese when she was in her viewing that Iranian foreign
[02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:47.280]  minister or smelled her upper lip she helps sell the whole Serb genocide and
[02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:51.520]  made all that up I mean she's a real operative you can tell like Blitzer and
[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:56.120]  all the rest those people absolutely yeah that that was that was a set up
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:44:59.560]  interview they could have sent anyone in there other than almond poor to
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:03.920]  interview the minister but they chose not to they wanted that to be a
[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:08.680]  concert confrontational interview that's right we're gonna get some calls now
[02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:13.240]  then go to Leanne and come back to calls into the next hour a little bit and I've
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:17.120]  got my info here on who's hosting the fourth hour today we'll be getting to
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:20.560]  that in the next segment but before I go any further let's go to Anthony and
[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:23.800]  Nevada he's got an interesting point to raise go ahead you're on the air with
[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:30.960]  Alex Jones and Wayne Madsen yeah hi Alex and Wayne I noticed today on Facebook
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:37.440]  and I confirmed it with the office of the governor's account that Greg Abbott
[02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:42.920]  is actually in Davos right now and with all the evil going on at Davos and
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:49.520]  Abbott being one of our you know favorite sons in the Liberty Movement what
[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:53.280]  do you think you're doing there well yeah this is a question I get a lot okay
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:58.560]  if if I was invited to Davos I would go the Davos is a public Bilderberg
[02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:02.600]  meeting where they push their globalist agenda but upwards of 10 20 30 percent
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:07.480]  of people there are good folks in Texas is a boom town when the rest of the
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:11.400]  you know countries falling apart now with the oil situation and the fracking
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:14.400]  and things going bankrupt that's not going to go too much longer he's there
[02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:17.440]  literally goes on trade missions every couple months trying to get jobs here
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:22.920]  that's his main focus is low taxes jobs so I expect to hear him come back and
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:26.720]  criticize their agenda talk about it try to stand up for Texas in America while
[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:30.920]  he's there he's pushing a con con to try to you know stop what's going on in
[02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:35.720]  in Congress I mean I I know he's good by his actions he can meet with the devil
[02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:39.320]  and that's fine with me as long as he doesn't change his actions I mean I've
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:42.440]  gone and met with globalist before I've gone and met with high-powered people in
[02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:45.320]  private and it's a private meeting I don't talk about it doesn't mean I ever
[02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:49.600]  accepted their offers Wayne Madsen do you agree with me or disagree well I mean I
[02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:54.120]  think that this is one of these forums where everybody has to meet some sort of
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:58.920]  their vetted somehow so you're not you're not going to get somebody I don't
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:03.480]  think there is going to then go out and say oh they what a disgusting bunch of
[02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:07.520]  people I mean it's hard to criticize people when you're sitting with them at
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:13.160]  dinner drinking with them socializing with them and this is how they this is
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:16.680]  how they get their clutches that's the answer there he's powerful they're
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:19.880]  trying just like they bring governors to Bilderberg they're bringing him there
[02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:24.240]  probably try to co-opt him I'm sure they are because you know once you get a
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:29.440]  taste of that's a real good caviar that sells for like $200 for an ounce you
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:35.160]  know you you can be swayed very very easily I will tell you to watch it what
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:42.200]  do you think's going on Anthony well I'm I'm sure he's there taking it all in
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:46.960]  and and and you know if he's a good reader of people he's gonna know when
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:51.720]  he's being lied to but I I'm I'm just wondering if you if you think he might
[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:56.640]  be in any danger or no I mean I mean this isn't as as cloaking daggers
[02:47:56.640 --> 02:48:00.400]  Bilderberg it's pretty much where they put out their globalist propaganda so a
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:04.960]  lot of it's just stages and glitz and Hollywood and trade missions the people
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:09.160]  there are sinister the agenda sinister but this is where they soft sell it it's
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:11.880]  not like he's meeting with specter in the middle of the desert but but it's a
[02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:16.880]  good point in fact I'd be surprised if he didn't go to things like Davos you
[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:20.440]  know I mean this is what but Wayne's right they're bringing him there because
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:25.400]  he's a major up-and-comer now let's go to and you'll be riding shotgun with us
[02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:30.160]  Leigh Ann McAdoo from Flint Michigan filing amazing reports at info wars.com
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:34.000]  for the nightly news Leigh Ann continuing with the breakdown of what's
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:38.360]  happening there in Flint I see it as emblematic of this rotting country and
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:43.000]  what NAFTA and GATT have done and of corrupt government and I think it's a
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:46.000]  scapegoat of the governor I'm not defending the governor either but the
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:49.880]  local city and what's going on they're just as culpable as the governor in my
[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:53.560]  view what's your view and then we'll get Wayne's view well absolutely that's
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:55.920]  kind of something that we're gonna be talking about coming up in some
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:48:59.720]  upcoming videos they keep kind of passing the buck saying well no it was this
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:03.560]  emergency manager will know it was this emergency manager but it doesn't I mean
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:08.680]  again and again and again the red flags were there and they just kept passing
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:13.000]  the buck the city voted against getting cut off from the Detroit water then they
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:16.320]  wanted to get cut off and so they're trying to figure out who to blame but
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:21.040]  it's not about blaming one person it's about fixing the problem and it's so
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:24.760]  corrupt here the government is so bloated and corrupt that nobody can fix
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:29.200]  anything they all just want to run around pointing blame and you're gonna be
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:32.200]  talking to locals about the real number of deaths and more but that's a good
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:38.520]  point Wayne in the final equation why do you think Flint resembles Calcutta
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:43.920]  well I think it's again it's the it's the jet they killed every manufacturing
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:49.480]  job almost in this country with all this baloney these baloney trade
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:55.080]  agreements and I mean NAFTA it was supposed to open the border between the
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:59.280]  United States and Canada I didn't need a passport before NAFTA to go back and
[02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:05.160]  port to Canada I need one now and and appointing emergency managers is so
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:09.840]  undemocratic we saw it happen in Detroit they try to raffle they try to
[02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:14.360]  raffle off to the highest bidder all this Detroit art museum these priceless
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:18.160]  collections just to make money for the city and then same thing happened in
[02:50:18.160 --> 02:50:21.840]  Flint with these emergency man yeah it's good money after bad Wayne stay there
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:24.720]  stay there we're gonna come back with Leigh Ann for this segment and the next
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:28.080]  and then we're gonna pass the baton to David Knight but Lee and what else you

[02:53:03.160 --> 02:53:05.920]  you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic
[02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:09.440]  pickpocketing ten years ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying
[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:12.880]  eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card
[02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:17.120]  with a built-in radio chip called RFID I felt having to broadcast my personal
[02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:21.240]  information was an invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced that
[02:53:21.240 --> 02:53:25.640]  credit cards debit cards US passports hotel room keys and even transit passes
[02:53:25.640 --> 02:53:30.000]  would all soon incorporate RFID it was then I formed ID Stronghold to share
[02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:33.720]  my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world there are a lot of
[02:53:33.720 --> 02:53:37.960]  misconceptions out there today about RFID I encourage everyone to get informed and

[02:54:20.720 --> 02:54:26.760]  take some of your calls we're not here covering all these negative things to
[02:54:26.760 --> 02:54:31.560]  just say it's all over the world's great we have such innovation humanity can go
[02:54:31.560 --> 02:54:35.800]  to the stars together life extension it's all within our grasp the elite are
[02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:40.760]  producing a scientific dictatorship called the technocracy in Davos's own
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:50.000]  words with a planetary regime above the law it's the 21st century threat people
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:53.960]  now know about it we force it out in the open you force it out in the open the
[02:54:53.960 --> 02:55:00.680]  battle is joined I want to go to Howard and Steve listening on KOMY and and
[02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:05.080]  John a few others here just a second but Leanne I know your reports are coming
[02:55:05.080 --> 02:55:08.960]  out a lot of them are on info wars.com I know you're gonna talk to locals and
[02:55:08.960 --> 02:55:11.880]  point out hey they had fluoride and all those other stuff in the water
[02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:15.960]  afterwards I mean it's you know kind of an oxymoron to complain about the lead
[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:19.600]  but then look at this but I mean it is crazy that they knew people were dying
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:24.960]  and and and I mean people should go to prison for this Leanne what where do you
[02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:29.040]  think all this is going well I mean that's the thing that's just so frightening
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:31.880]  I've talked to some people here and they say they don't want this to get
[02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:36.840]  politicized because that's gonna just congest the it's congest the whole thing
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:41.240]  even further I mean just dig up the lead pipes and so that's sort of the gridlock
[02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:45.720]  that we're seeing here with this but I mean as these emails come out as the
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:49.320]  people are beginning to see just how deep this cover up went and just the
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:54.320]  neglect and just people passing the buck saying no don't tell anyone I mean we
[02:55:54.320 --> 02:55:58.520]  have emails from mothers who were taking their children into the doctor
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:03.000]  saying you know they're getting these rashes and taking these blood samples and
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:07.320]  then the doctors I guess they would get some orders from high up that would say
[02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:12.080]  no don't take those samples and can't trust those I mean it's just well Leanne
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:15.720]  there's your headline I mean if you've got that do report just talk about the
[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:20.440]  reports you're getting mothers mothers doctors told my doctors covered up sick
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:24.280]  babies in Flint I mean that is incredible see how this culture of cover
[02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:30.960]  up just rolls downhill Wayne Madsen yeah and it doesn't surprise me because you
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:35.720]  know that as I was saying that the first casualty of appointing emergency
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:40.500]  managers for cities is that the emergency manager comes in and tells the
[02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:43.760]  mayor I'm in charge and mayor says well where are you from well the emergency
[02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:48.600]  managers usually aren't even from that town or their family minions they're
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:53.240]  from another state in some case like the one I gave to Detroit and so the mayor
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:59.680]  is shunted aside the city council has no say the emergency manager takes his
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:05.400]  orders from the governor in this case Snyder and Lansing and and it looks like
[02:57:05.400 --> 02:57:13.520]  maybe some of Snyder's friends in the health care industry which is one of
[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:19.120]  the major contributors by the way made money off the sick yeah insurance
[02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:23.200]  scramble that's the case he needs to be right right and we don't we don't want
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:26.360]  to hear anything about no sick babies because that's going to run our health
[02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:32.120]  our costs up because this is you know these are HMOs these are a privatized
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:35.520]  high you just taught me something I'm saying it's true the county and city
[02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:38.640]  should have handled it but if they were under an emergency decree that is the
[02:57:38.640 --> 02:57:43.600]  governor's fall and he's got a jail for these emails he should and and it took
[02:57:43.600 --> 02:57:48.280]  up president Obama a long time to even respond to the Flint situation and he
[02:57:48.280 --> 02:57:52.960]  although he can say it wasn't the feds it was the state where where was he
[02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:58.480]  earlier I mean shares getting bottles of water sent in from Iceland and we're
[02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:00.960]  going to break in one minute with you and want to take a few calls but is that
[02:58:00.960 --> 02:58:04.600]  not unprecedented what he just pointed out that the governor was over this I
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:08.800]  didn't realize that reading 50 news articles on this they obscured all that
[02:58:08.800 --> 02:58:13.000]  so he's passing the buck to lian yeah absolutely and that's the thing that
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:16.920]  people voted and the emergency manager just comes in and says we don't care
[02:58:16.920 --> 02:58:19.920]  about your vote this is what we're gonna do here so it's just very frightening
[02:58:19.920 --> 02:58:25.440]  wow so state dictatorship forced poison water on Flint I I didn't understand
[02:58:25.440 --> 02:58:28.080]  that when I'm wrong which isn't a lot but I'm wrong sometimes I'll admit it
[02:58:28.080 --> 02:58:31.080]  well I didn't understand that this is even worse thank you Wayne for pointing

[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:51.960]  before I sleep let's go ahead and talk to John in New York because you bring up
[03:00:51.960 --> 03:00:56.440]  sleeper cells in the U.S. we know they're here that's a false flag in and of
[03:00:56.440 --> 03:01:00.000]  itself because they let the radical Islamics in let them attack and then
[03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:04.360]  that they they don't get in trouble who brought them in go ahead John from New
[03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:11.000]  York yes guys I used to work for a major television network on the west side of
[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:20.840]  Manhattan I'm eating lunch in that building was a famous hard-hitting news
[03:01:20.840 --> 03:01:26.800]  investigation thing that shows up on Sunday nights uses a stopwatch 60 minutes
[03:01:26.800 --> 03:01:34.600]  story one yes about general general Alexander what was a lab bed and the
[03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:41.520]  disappeared 25 suitcase next yes I that's part of it but before that happened
[03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:48.560]  what made that story happen was that a story came in and was covered by CBS
[03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:56.720]  News that called came in that a nuclear suitcase bomb was found in a garage in
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:02:04.520]  lower Manhattan now I was at home when the story came on watching television I
[03:02:04.520 --> 03:02:08.920]  had a TV tray with some food on it when that story came on the tray went one
[03:02:08.920 --> 03:02:13.320]  way and the food went the other way trying to record it I couldn't do it so I
[03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:17.760]  figured I'd be at work the next day I'd go down to the newsroom and try to get a
[03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:21.720]  three-quarter inch pneumatic copy of the day let me guess they wouldn't give it to
[03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:28.600]  you yeah exactly oh I heard them on CBS radio say that they blew up World Trade
[03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:32.280]  Center 7 leveled it no one believed me when I got back on the air that day I
[03:02:32.280 --> 03:02:35.600]  was in there like 10 hours I literally went got a pizza down the road during a
[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:41.520]  break for 30 minutes and then years later the video service it was on CNN and
[03:02:41.520 --> 03:02:45.640]  Fox and that they jumped the gun Reuters had given them a report saying it they
[03:02:45.640 --> 03:02:50.200]  had they had they had you know basically jumped in the race before the
[03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:54.760]  starting pistol fired that's amazing I'm gonna have Wayne and and Leanne finish
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:58.360]  up in the next segment and then Leanne's gonna tell us some of the report she's
[03:02:58.360 --> 03:03:02.620]  got coming up from Flint but Wayne I mean it is that type of memory hole stuff
[03:03:02.620 --> 03:03:05.920]  where you see it and then they won't give you a copy of it that's what's really
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:12.080]  spooky yeah it's it's what I've noticed with a lot of breaking stories is they
[03:03:12.080 --> 03:03:18.880]  always say oh no the initials information is wrong and it's later that we
[03:03:18.880 --> 03:03:22.640]  get the correct information I don't believe that to be true I believe that
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:27.560]  the initial reports often are right on the money because sure it's fresh and
[03:03:27.560 --> 03:03:32.720]  witnesses minds and it's just like what happened in in Dealey Plaza in Dallas
[03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:38.320]  those witnesses who saw what they saw were later pressured by the FBI and a
[03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:42.680]  changing sure but I mean we're building seven they said it fell before it fell
[03:03:42.680 --> 03:03:48.240]  and then it did I mean we really caught them exactly and you know the same thing
[03:03:48.240 --> 03:03:53.560]  with their 1993 Trade Center bombing they came out with initial reports and
[03:03:53.560 --> 03:03:58.000]  later we were told no they weren't correct either so I mean this whole
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:03.440]  situation with the news media as the caller from New York is suggesting they
[03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:08.600]  do manipulate the news they've been in manipulating the news at least since the
[03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:13.400]  end of World War two with the CIA's program called a mighty world sir where
[03:04:13.400 --> 03:04:17.880]  they can go to television networks papers and etc. Leanne I've run us up to the
[03:04:17.880 --> 03:04:21.280]  clock both of you for two minutes on the other side try to have another call
[03:04:21.280 --> 03:04:23.920]  we're not handed over to David Knight here he's got a bunch of key stuff
[03:04:23.920 --> 03:04:28.560]  coming up across the board but Leanne what else you got coming up in your
[03:04:28.560 --> 03:04:33.760]  investigations well we're gonna try and get some really great drone footage just
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:38.400]  here in this town and so let people get a bird's-eye view of how beautiful this
[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:42.400]  architecture was it is from this city and then you go when you see how
[03:04:42.400 --> 03:04:47.920]  dilapidated it all is drone shows devastated Flint oh yes so it's gonna
[03:04:47.920 --> 03:04:51.520]  be a really good view there and obviously we're gonna be speaking to some
[03:04:51.520 --> 03:04:54.920]  locals trying to get a personal count from people who have actually been in
[03:04:54.920 --> 03:05:00.640]  the most amazing stay there Leanne the Democratic Party establishment that
[03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:04.320]  wants to install Hillary into the White House in this next election season is
[03:05:04.320 --> 03:05:08.240]  currently in freefall the plan for potential first husband Bill Clinton
[03:05:08.240 --> 03:05:11.760]  has failed miserably as women have crawled out of the woodwork to describe

[03:07:59.840 --> 03:08:10.040]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network I love
[03:08:10.040 --> 03:08:16.120]  how Hillary lands in Texas it only has six idiot supporters waiting for her and
[03:08:16.120 --> 03:08:19.400]  I love the gimmick of oh she's a woman so they have these articles the Washington
[03:08:19.400 --> 03:08:25.240]  Post all the women and the press are supporting her because she's a woman it's
[03:08:25.240 --> 03:08:28.720]  just weird I didn't eat politics I mean I would vote for somebody is there a man
[03:08:28.720 --> 03:08:34.040]  or a woman it's like the left claims they're so unbigoted and they're the
[03:08:34.040 --> 03:08:39.880]  most bigoted small-minded gang mentality group of idiots I've ever seen and again
[03:08:39.880 --> 03:08:44.600]  because they're not the left I am a liberal Thomas Jefferson style baby you
[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:49.080]  want to study history in classical sense Jefferson was a liberal Washington was a
[03:08:49.080 --> 03:08:53.200]  conservative I'm in between those two guys because I've read their debates
[03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:56.840]  between each other the first and third president Wayne I want to Lee and I had
[03:08:56.840 --> 03:08:59.760]  her go because the lights dropping they're gonna launch a drone they've got a
[03:08:59.760 --> 03:09:03.240]  bunch of interviews and so the intrepid reporter she wanted to get out there and
[03:09:03.240 --> 03:09:09.480]  get to work but on what I just said the labels I mean obviously the neocons are
[03:09:09.480 --> 03:09:13.320]  horrible we opposed them but now the Democrats am I wrong in saying it's like
[03:09:13.320 --> 03:09:18.680]  watching cancer metastasize and in Europe too isn't the establishment using the
[03:09:18.680 --> 03:09:25.040]  left to make its biggest advancements ever for tyranny well I've noticed on the
[03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:29.680]  web the debate between the Hillary supporters and the supporters of Bernie
[03:09:29.680 --> 03:09:36.960]  Sanders and I gotta I gotta say that there's appears to be this regimented
[03:09:36.960 --> 03:09:43.520]  attempt to force the Hillary people into some sort of group think that they all
[03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:50.480]  are preaching off the same talking point memo received from the Clinton campaign
[03:09:50.480 --> 03:09:56.600]  headquarters up in Brooklyn in New York and you know whether you agree with
[03:09:56.600 --> 03:10:03.840]  Sanders or not his supporters are really being torn apart by the by the
[03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:10.680]  Hillary Clinton supporters are accusing them of being you know white elitists as
[03:10:10.680 --> 03:10:15.120]  Sanders is you know trying to make this a race issue yeah I didn't even cover
[03:10:15.120 --> 03:10:18.080]  that today that's why I love having you on I've got two articles here in the
[03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:22.360]  stack where they go Sanders is too white and you're white and you're racist and
[03:10:22.360 --> 03:10:26.960]  you're sexist when the guy is the most flaming liberal in the galaxy it just
[03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:32.000]  shows they are nakedly using sex and race baiting to divide and conquer yeah
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:36.560]  you can say say a lot of things about Bernie Sanders but I mean he was
[03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:41.600]  involved in the civil rights movement back in the 60s he's anything I mean the
[03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:48.080]  guy was elected as a socialist candidate for mayor of Burlington Vermont with
[03:10:48.080 --> 03:10:51.040]  some people call the People's Republic of Berlin yeah what does that tell the
[03:10:51.040 --> 03:10:54.760]  leftist that support him many of them you know are well-meaning people that
[03:10:54.760 --> 03:10:58.440]  the Democratic Party would would use political correctness on them that
[03:10:58.440 --> 03:11:03.200]  ought to be a wake-up call yeah that and you had Joe Biden by the way almost
[03:11:03.200 --> 03:11:07.640]  sounding like Joe McCarty's saying McCarty saying well you know we know
[03:11:07.640 --> 03:11:12.680]  that Bernie Sanders is a card-carrying socialist like well you know is that
[03:11:12.680 --> 03:11:18.440]  sort of like McCarthy saying I got here in my hand a list of 57 known
[03:11:18.440 --> 03:11:22.880]  communists in the State Department when in fact he was speaking at a banquet and
[03:11:22.880 --> 03:11:27.120]  he noticed he got the number from a bottle Heinz 57 steak sauce sitting on
[03:11:27.120 --> 03:11:30.800]  the banquet table well the truth is we know the big Robert Barron's were
[03:11:30.800 --> 03:11:34.400]  funding Stalin and Mao and all of them the whole time I mean it's fascism
[03:11:34.400 --> 03:11:38.800]  couples with socialism and communism to control this really all crony capitalism
[03:11:38.800 --> 03:11:42.880]  and until we wake up to that dichotomy it's game over we've got loaded phones

[03:15:03.800 --> 03:15:08.360]  ahead and hand the baton to David Knight Hillary in San Antonio Hillary
[03:15:08.360 --> 03:15:12.200]  lands only has a few supporters driverless cars government funded
[03:15:12.200 --> 03:15:15.480]  California is having to wait 18 months to get an appointment to apply for
[03:15:15.480 --> 03:15:20.040]  concealed carry how they kill the segment with bureaucracy Davos elite
[03:15:20.040 --> 03:15:25.440]  freak out about Trump it's all coming up right now with David Knight I'm Alex
[03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:29.800]  Jones signing off from the war room he's in the situation room. Thank you Alex
[03:15:29.800 --> 03:15:33.400]  and I want to talk about what's going on in the in the bigger picture here with
[03:15:33.400 --> 03:15:37.320]  Davos because we're seeing a lot of information coming out of that as it
[03:15:37.320 --> 03:15:42.280]  this one article that's up on the drudge report about the specter of Donald
[03:15:42.280 --> 03:15:48.400]  Trump haunting Davos now I would say the people there are specter these are the
[03:15:48.400 --> 03:15:53.160]  James Bond villains there's not a specter of Donald Trump it is specter and
[03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:56.600]  that is an interesting thing because I think they're looking at this they're
[03:15:56.600 --> 03:16:01.400]  concerned about how every day we see more information about how they expect to
[03:16:01.400 --> 03:16:06.520]  have AI robots take over their factories they're gonna run their businesses for
[03:16:06.520 --> 03:16:10.800]  them they're concerned because how are they going to manage the slaves the
[03:16:10.800 --> 03:16:15.600]  human slaves us because you understand that a robot really comes from I think
[03:16:15.600 --> 03:16:19.920]  it was a check word for slave that's what they they derived that from so
[03:16:19.920 --> 03:16:24.400]  they're looking for mechanical slaves to replace the human slaves you know when
[03:16:24.400 --> 03:16:29.720]  you look at Brave New World Huxley was talking about deliberately dumbing down
[03:16:29.720 --> 03:16:35.280]  humans so to have a mass produced group of humans that they could use as
[03:16:35.280 --> 03:16:39.640]  slaves perhaps you could draw some analogies and we have in the past many
[03:16:39.640 --> 03:16:42.480]  times with what's going on with fluoride the chemicals that they put in the water
[03:16:42.480 --> 03:16:47.880]  to try to take away IQ points we see this happening very quickly in Flint
[03:16:47.880 --> 03:16:53.600]  Michigan with what they've done there but when you look at these programs why
[03:16:53.600 --> 03:17:00.280]  isn't it a criminal offense to make people pay for dumping toxic stuff that's
[03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:05.680]  going to lower your your IQ going to have tremendous adverse effects on your
[03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:10.120]  health fluoride drum dumping that in the water we know from Harvard studies from
[03:17:10.120 --> 03:17:15.240]  Chinese studies that you get 20 points off of the IQ of children when you put
[03:17:15.240 --> 03:17:20.680]  this in you have no way of controlling the dosage when you dump medication into
[03:17:20.680 --> 03:17:25.160]  the water but we've got those types of issues but getting back to Davis okay
[03:17:25.160 --> 03:17:29.040]  they're looking at this and they're saying well one guy says I think the
[03:17:29.040 --> 03:17:32.160]  nominees will be Trump for the Republicans Hillary for the Democrats the
[03:17:32.160 --> 03:17:36.920]  next year will be very uncertain a chaotic period and of course they are
[03:17:36.920 --> 03:17:40.920]  worried about that they're worried about Trump because they don't control Trump
[03:17:40.920 --> 03:17:45.240]  that doesn't mean understand that he's necessarily going to help us okay it's
[03:17:45.240 --> 03:17:48.760]  just that they don't control him and I think we have to be very careful that
[03:17:48.760 --> 03:17:52.440]  we don't make that kind of connection that just because you know they don't
[03:17:52.440 --> 03:17:55.760]  like him he's he's a good guy nevertheless when you look at what
[03:17:55.760 --> 03:18:01.080]  they're most concerned about the things like trade and open borders yeah he is
[03:18:01.080 --> 03:18:05.760]  against them definitely against them and with us they said the prospect of a
[03:18:05.760 --> 03:18:11.160]  Trump White House is ratcheting up anxiety amongst the 2,500 business and
[03:18:11.160 --> 03:18:15.560]  political leaders gathered in the Swiss ski resort for the annual World Economic
[03:18:15.560 --> 03:18:20.440]  Forum they usually talk about it as the W E F I look at and I say the WTF
[03:18:20.440 --> 03:18:24.600]  because that's why I look at this is like what is going on this is openly
[03:18:24.600 --> 03:18:30.360]  plotting against us just as we've seen in the last week we see another example
[03:18:30.360 --> 03:18:33.800]  not just these trade treaties like Trans Pacific transatlantic partnership where
[03:18:33.800 --> 03:18:37.600]  they openly write the regulations they tell the lawmakers that we like to shut
[03:18:37.600 --> 03:18:41.840]  up you can't see this you can't talk about it they're openly writing the
[03:18:41.840 --> 03:18:47.160]  regulations for driverless cars and the other issue of this which I think pulls
[03:18:47.160 --> 03:18:50.640]  this together is with all this talk about robots all this talk about
[03:18:50.640 --> 03:18:55.880]  driverless cars one of the things that's on the horizon besides greasing the skids
[03:18:55.880 --> 03:18:59.200]  for Google and the others who went to Washington they went to the Obama
[03:18:59.200 --> 03:19:03.520]  administration the Department of Transportation said look we've had a
[03:19:03.520 --> 03:19:07.080]  pretty bad record and it's come out with a safety in California so the
[03:19:07.080 --> 03:19:11.800]  California Department of Transportation it's about to mandate some rules to make
[03:19:11.800 --> 03:19:15.480]  sure that we have a human capable of taking over control the car we don't
[03:19:15.480 --> 03:19:20.480]  want that we don't want that we want to accelerate the driverless cars not have
[03:19:20.480 --> 03:19:24.760]  them operate under safety but of course they sell it to you as a safety device
[03:19:24.760 --> 03:19:29.400]  that's not what it's about so the Obama administration says fine tell you what
[03:19:29.400 --> 03:19:33.680]  we'll do we'll give massive subsidies to Silicon Valley companies to develop
[03:19:33.680 --> 03:19:38.200]  this and we'll give them flexible regulations in other words we will shut
[03:19:38.200 --> 03:19:42.400]  down any safety regulations any safety concerns at a state and local level and
[03:19:42.400 --> 03:19:46.920]  we'll grease the skids for you meanwhile for Americans we will mandate
[03:19:46.920 --> 03:19:50.560]  something that we're going to talk about briefly here vehicle to vehicle and
[03:19:50.560 --> 03:19:54.480]  vehicle to infrastructure we haven't really talked about that that's one of
[03:19:54.480 --> 03:19:57.720]  the ways they're going to control the slaves when we get angry we'll be right
[03:19:57.720 --> 03:20:02.880]  back winter has just begun and are you already tired of being cold how would

[03:25:44.600 --> 03:25:49.080]  snowmageddon 2016 they're saying this winter storm that would they're already
[03:25:49.080 --> 03:25:54.280]  feeling the effects of this in Washington DC I saw where I think it was a 20
[03:25:54.280 --> 03:25:59.280]  minute ride that Barack Obama would take it took him one or two hours I'm
[03:25:59.280 --> 03:26:02.520]  going by memory here but they got stuck in this no storm they say they expect
[03:26:02.520 --> 03:26:08.360]  50 to 60 mile an hour winds and DC more than two feet of snow that's huge I
[03:26:08.360 --> 03:26:14.000]  used to live not too far south of Washington and I know that that type of
[03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:19.680]  storm is big for that area of the country they are not capable of dealing
[03:26:19.680 --> 03:26:27.720]  with that I was actually lived in North Carolina and one year we went up to it
[03:26:27.720 --> 03:26:32.360]  was up to Buffalo New York and we got there just before Thanksgiving and it
[03:26:32.360 --> 03:26:36.720]  was the most snow they had in a short period of time now that had a record
[03:26:36.720 --> 03:26:41.040]  snowstorm with more total snow but this happened so quickly they had a gridlock
[03:26:41.040 --> 03:26:45.200]  and this is round Thanksgiving had a gridlock that kept some people stuck
[03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:50.480]  in stores for three days that's why it's maybe a good idea to have some
[03:26:50.480 --> 03:26:55.120]  supplies a bug out bag with you I know people who always travel with a bug out
[03:26:55.120 --> 03:27:00.320]  bag in the back of their trunk with some supplies some storeable foods that type
[03:27:00.320 --> 03:27:04.320]  of thing let's go to a couple of the calls and we'll go back to these articles
[03:27:04.320 --> 03:27:13.160]  Kevin in Florida go ahead you had some solutions my question for you is what
[03:27:13.160 --> 03:27:17.960]  Domino Domino do you think will have to fall for the non-info warrior it's to
[03:27:17.960 --> 03:27:22.600]  wake up because it feels like there's so much stuff going on I mean when you
[03:27:22.600 --> 03:27:26.320]  turn on the TV all that's being talked about is how black people tainted in the
[03:27:26.320 --> 03:27:31.560]  Oscars when we have a situation with Flint and in fact if Alex wants to see
[03:27:31.560 --> 03:27:35.320]  something even truly more amazing than that in the Flint I'm originally from
[03:27:35.320 --> 03:27:39.960]  Detroit and I have family those all the next you should have Leanne travel down
[03:27:39.960 --> 03:27:44.000]  to Dearborn where there are parts of dear Dearborn that are totally have been
[03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:48.400]  totally taken over there's nothing written in English it's all Arabic and
[03:27:48.400 --> 03:27:53.360]  they're operating under strict things they're Sharia law so I mean yeah it's a
[03:27:53.360 --> 03:27:56.480]  good point what what does it take what does it take for people I mean we look
[03:27:56.480 --> 03:28:00.680]  at these stories like we had yesterday we put out the the park service openly
[03:28:00.680 --> 03:28:06.200]  bragging about how much land they stole saying yeah lands the talking about
[03:28:06.200 --> 03:28:10.240]  their group we're the bad guys we take people's property and we always take it
[03:28:10.240 --> 03:28:14.920]  for far less than it's worth I mean they brag about this what does it take I
[03:28:14.920 --> 03:28:18.760]  mean they're about to take our ability to move around freely in this country
[03:28:18.760 --> 03:28:22.720]  that's a key part of what is going on with the driverless cars it's not going
[03:28:22.720 --> 03:28:27.880]  to be you get to choose your you know as he said about the insurance plan you
[03:28:27.880 --> 03:28:31.120]  know you like your insurance policy you can keep your insurance policy you like
[03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:34.120]  your car you can keep your car no they're going to change that they're
[03:28:34.120 --> 03:28:37.240]  going to have not only vehicle to vehicle communication but vehicle to
[03:28:37.240 --> 03:28:40.920]  infrastructure communication they're going to be talking and collecting
[03:28:40.920 --> 03:28:44.840]  talking to your car collecting all this information turning every stop light
[03:28:44.840 --> 03:28:49.520]  into the equivalent of a stoplight camera they're going to be micromanaging
[03:28:49.520 --> 03:28:52.160]  the way you drive the insurance companies are going to be looking at how
[03:28:52.160 --> 03:28:56.680]  quickly you take the corners how quickly you break the speed limit that you're
[03:28:56.680 --> 03:29:00.320]  traveling every inch of the way that you're going they will use that
[03:29:00.320 --> 03:29:04.360]  information to raise your insurance rates to force you out of your car and
[03:29:04.360 --> 03:29:08.800]  then they're going to offer the solution this is their ideal solution you're
[03:29:08.800 --> 03:29:13.560]  going to pick up the phone you're going to call and a summon a driverless car as
[03:29:13.560 --> 03:29:18.960]  your chauffeur okay let me explain something to you these driverless cars
[03:29:18.960 --> 03:29:23.880]  are going to have all the same costs built into them that you have in your
[03:29:23.880 --> 03:29:26.600]  car you're gonna have the cost of the car you got the cost of the insurance the
[03:29:26.600 --> 03:29:32.040]  fuel the repairs the depreciation all of that is going to be in the cost of
[03:29:32.040 --> 03:29:36.160]  these cars and there's going to be a profit added to each of those steps it's
[03:29:36.160 --> 03:29:40.400]  like a value-added tax one guy or two or three corporations are going to own
[03:29:40.400 --> 03:29:45.280]  all transportation and turn the information into a control grid for the
[03:29:45.280 --> 03:29:48.280]  government stay with us we'll be right back with more of your calls we're on

[03:33:07.320 --> 03:33:11.440]  GCN radio network
[03:33:13.840 --> 03:33:17.600]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on David Knight your host and we've got a
[03:33:17.600 --> 03:33:21.560]  couple of people who've been holding for quite some time I want to get to Steven
[03:33:21.560 --> 03:33:25.480]  California and then we're going to talk about something that's happening in
[03:33:25.480 --> 03:33:30.720]  North Carolina I see this as as crony capitalism really coming for full
[03:33:30.720 --> 03:33:36.160]  circle I saw crony capitalism I when I look at American history and of course
[03:33:36.160 --> 03:33:39.960]  there were evidences of it beforehand part of the dispute between the north
[03:33:39.960 --> 03:33:43.840]  and the south was what the south called internal improvements in other words
[03:33:43.840 --> 03:33:47.640]  they didn't want to pay for infrastructure that was only going to
[03:33:47.640 --> 03:33:51.400]  benefit northern states something like the Erie Canal people in Virginia would
[03:33:51.400 --> 03:33:57.040]  say why should I be taxed to build a Erie Canal in Pennsylvania you're just
[03:33:57.040 --> 03:34:01.080]  redistributing wealth and of course there were elements of that but it really
[03:34:01.080 --> 03:34:06.160]  took off after the Civil War the GOP got into bed with the crony capitalist the
[03:34:06.160 --> 03:34:09.920]  robber barons a railroad companies and now we have a situation in North
[03:34:09.920 --> 03:34:16.680]  Carolina where you've got a railroad company CSX wants to build a large rail
[03:34:16.680 --> 03:34:22.320]  terminal and they not only want massive state subsidies but this railroad
[03:34:22.320 --> 03:34:27.680]  company wants to use eminent domain to take the property for their private use
[03:34:27.680 --> 03:34:31.120]  where we've seen this before so we're gonna talk about that in just a moment
[03:34:31.120 --> 03:34:34.800]  before we do I want to go to Steve who's been hanging on for a long time Steve
[03:34:34.800 --> 03:34:40.160]  go ahead hey David how are you doing good thanks for calling all right hey my
[03:34:40.160 --> 03:34:46.200]  question was regarding what Obama said and on his visit to Russia about waiting
[03:34:46.200 --> 03:34:54.320]  until after the election in 2016 and then in recent months with appearances of
[03:34:54.320 --> 03:35:00.400]  missiles do you see a possible correlation or have any insight into what
[03:35:00.400 --> 03:35:05.880]  Obama was talking about I mean I'm thinking possibly missile launch is a
[03:35:05.880 --> 03:35:14.680]  false black for you know security emerge exactly who knows I mean look at the
[03:35:14.680 --> 03:35:18.880]  x-files trailer that's the for the premiere that's coming up this week and
[03:35:18.880 --> 03:35:22.800]  of course they're trained changing that looks like they still got the alien
[03:35:22.800 --> 03:35:26.520]  technology in it still have the UFO angle in it but they've gone a lot more
[03:35:26.520 --> 03:35:32.520]  into the New World Order false flag type of plot lines for the x-files and
[03:35:32.520 --> 03:35:35.360]  of course one of the things they say is you know it starts out it'll start on a
[03:35:35.360 --> 03:35:38.920]  Friday or Saturday or something like that it looked like a terrorist attack or
[03:35:38.920 --> 03:35:45.120]  looked like Russia attack look they want to have uncertainty fear and doubt they
[03:35:45.120 --> 03:35:51.400]  want to make sure that you are going to run to them for safety but they also want
[03:35:51.400 --> 03:35:55.600]  to have the military industrial complex have a profit center all of these things
[03:35:55.600 --> 03:36:01.360]  boil into this and when you look at Davos they look at the collapsing economy
[03:36:01.360 --> 03:36:04.480]  they know there's going to be a lot of unrest they need to distract your
[03:36:04.480 --> 03:36:09.040]  attention one of the ways that's always been done throughout history is with wars
[03:36:09.040 --> 03:36:12.920]  we know that the banks have always profited from the wars they've always
[03:36:12.920 --> 03:36:18.400]  profited from chaos and they've always font funded Marxist for example I mean
[03:36:18.400 --> 03:36:22.480]  they gave Lenin ten million dollars put him on a train seal the train and send
[03:36:22.480 --> 03:36:26.520]  him from Switzerland into Russia to start the revolution there they want
[03:36:26.520 --> 03:36:32.560]  chaos whenever things are markets are collapsing or markets are soaring they
[03:36:32.560 --> 03:36:36.520]  make money if everything is stable they don't like that they do want to have
[03:36:36.520 --> 03:36:41.760]  stable control of who's in charge that's why they don't like Trump that's why
[03:36:41.760 --> 03:36:45.040]  they're concerned about this at Davos they're looking at this and say wait a
[03:36:45.040 --> 03:36:50.400]  minute this is a guy that we don't have any hooks into yet like we do Hillary or
[03:36:50.400 --> 03:36:56.200]  Jeb or Rubio or these other people that Goldman Sachs is giving lots of money to
[03:36:56.200 --> 03:37:00.160]  so they're concerned about that they want to have this in the background they
[03:37:00.160 --> 03:37:04.320]  know that besides the typical boom and bust cycles that they've engineered with
[03:37:04.320 --> 03:37:07.880]  the banks with the federal with the central banks especially they know that
[03:37:07.880 --> 03:37:12.280]  there is massive upheaval that is coming with artificial intelligence this is
[03:37:12.280 --> 03:37:17.720]  something that isn't just going to be like the upheaval that we saw with the
[03:37:17.720 --> 03:37:21.280]  change from an agrarian to an industrial society this is going to affect
[03:37:21.280 --> 03:37:26.080]  every aspect of life it's not just going to affect factory workers it's going to
[03:37:26.080 --> 03:37:29.840]  affect knowledge workers it's going to affect white collar workers blue collar
[03:37:29.840 --> 03:37:33.400]  workers it's going to affect everyone we're going to see massive unemployment
[03:37:33.400 --> 03:37:37.760]  is going to be incredibly disruptive they want to have a way that they can
[03:37:37.760 --> 03:37:40.960]  control that and of course they want to have conflict I mean they have an
[03:37:40.960 --> 03:37:45.840]  economic reason to restart the Cold War but they have other reasons to restart
[03:37:45.840 --> 03:37:50.160]  that so I really don't know what's going on with I can tell you that and let me
[03:37:50.160 --> 03:37:54.360]  run down through some of what they're talking about in Davos that is really
[03:37:54.360 --> 03:37:58.880]  freaking them out this is Eric Cantor okay talking and remember Eric Cantor he
[03:37:58.880 --> 03:38:02.840]  was the number two to John Boehner and he'd lost in a primary it was pretty
[03:38:02.840 --> 03:38:07.040]  unprecedented when he lost in the primary but what is he doing now well
[03:38:07.040 --> 03:38:11.240]  he's hanging out with the James Bond villains in Davos and this is what he
[03:38:11.240 --> 03:38:15.920]  says unfortunately I do think that if there were to be a Trump administration
[03:38:15.920 --> 03:38:20.400]  the casualty would be trade Cantor says he doesn't think that Trump will make it
[03:38:20.400 --> 03:38:25.200]  through the primaries however yeah okay you just keep telling yourself that
[03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:29.600]  that's what the GOP has been saying Trump's positions he said like a
[03:38:29.600 --> 03:38:35.040]  temporary ban on Muslims controlling our borders they're earning him the
[03:38:35.040 --> 03:38:40.380]  appropriate of the people at Davos and in case you don't know that's the
[03:38:40.380 --> 03:38:46.200]  vilification these people detest him because he is rejecting their main tool
[03:38:46.200 --> 03:38:52.280]  of control and that is using open borders to destroy the cultures the
[03:38:52.280 --> 03:38:56.680]  countries to create conflict within the countries it's the same thing they've
[03:38:56.680 --> 03:39:01.560]  been doing to Russia for 60 years using the Muslims against Russia it's the same
[03:39:01.560 --> 03:39:05.840]  thing they've been doing throughout the Middle East using one group of Muslims
[03:39:05.840 --> 03:39:11.160]  against another funding these jihadis now they go on to say a Trump
[03:39:11.160 --> 03:39:14.680]  administration would be a disaster according to them this is a former US
[03:39:14.680 --> 03:39:20.000]  Treasury official and the Clinton administration Beth Brooke Marciniak they
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:24.960]  say the globe needs the US to be strong she said the US is still the horse that's
[03:39:24.960 --> 03:39:29.160]  pulling the cart more so now with capital outflows from emerging markets no
[03:39:29.160 --> 03:39:33.960]  listen they don't want the US to be strong they don't want Europe to be
[03:39:33.960 --> 03:39:38.360]  strong they need to take us down they need to level everything so they can
[03:39:38.360 --> 03:39:41.920]  create the society that they want that is why they have backed the Marxist
[03:39:41.920 --> 03:39:46.120]  dictators in the past that's precisely why this is happening and again they
[03:39:46.120 --> 03:39:50.400]  tell themselves well by the time we get to March April this is Lawrence Tish
[03:39:50.400 --> 03:39:53.800]  professor of history at Harvard University by time we get to March and
[03:39:53.800 --> 03:39:56.960]  April it's all over I think it's going to be a wonderful catharsis I'm really
[03:39:56.960 --> 03:40:01.920]  looking forward to Trump's humiliation okay well here's this other story that
[03:40:01.920 --> 03:40:06.600]  was up on the dredge report Trump is poised for the strongest primary
[03:40:06.600 --> 03:40:11.000]  performance in modern history so maybe there isn't going to be a catharsis
[03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:15.600]  maybe he isn't going to go as I point out maybe he could actually run the
[03:40:15.600 --> 03:40:22.720]  table he might even win Iowa and of course he is way ahead in New Hampshire
[03:40:22.720 --> 03:40:26.640]  they're pointing out that and this could be one way that they're trying to raise
[03:40:26.640 --> 03:40:30.600]  expectations saying well he didn't do nearly as well as we thought so you know
[03:40:30.600 --> 03:40:35.000]  his his his campaign has lost its momentum and and so forth that's the
[03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:39.680]  way they play these games as they point out they say Cruz campaign has been
[03:40:39.680 --> 03:40:44.920]  trying to raise expectations by touting that he's got great ground game in Iowa
[03:40:44.920 --> 03:40:49.320]  and so forth and so on they say but a narrow Cruz win would be an exciting up
[03:40:49.320 --> 03:40:53.920]  it would not would not be an exciting upset but that if he loses oh that would
[03:40:53.920 --> 03:40:59.080]  that would fail expectations so that's the way they play this and of course
[03:40:59.080 --> 03:41:03.120]  Cruz has been dropping down he's now neck and neck according to these polls if
[03:41:03.120 --> 03:41:09.160]  we can believe them with Donald Trump he has had everybody training their fire
[03:41:09.160 --> 03:41:13.680]  on him I think in all these cases that I've seen the criticisms of him have
[03:41:13.680 --> 03:41:18.160]  been spot-on same the criticisms I would have but they were training all their
[03:41:18.160 --> 03:41:23.120]  shots at Marco Rubio a couple of weeks ago now it's all at at Ted Cruz even the
[03:41:23.120 --> 03:41:28.320]  Iowa governor has done kind of a dis endorsement he didn't endorse anybody
[03:41:28.320 --> 03:41:32.600]  else but what he said was essentially anybody but Ted Cruz because Ted Cruz
[03:41:32.600 --> 03:41:37.160]  has opposed ethanol subsidies which basically I oppose I mean I agree with
[03:41:37.160 --> 03:41:41.640]  Ted Cruz on some of these issues as I've said before I think it is important
[03:41:41.640 --> 03:41:45.480]  for him if he's going to be putting himself out there as a constitutionalist
[03:41:45.480 --> 03:41:49.320]  he needs to make the case for his eligibility according to a strict
[03:41:49.320 --> 03:41:53.080]  interpretation of the Constitution does he have a case there is he just going
[03:41:53.080 --> 03:41:57.520]  to say well if you don't let me in then rubio couldn't run either and that
[03:41:57.520 --> 03:42:00.560]  that's not a defense that's not a defense for somebody who says he's a
[03:42:00.560 --> 03:42:04.720]  constitutionalist and the other thing that concerns me as well as most of
[03:42:04.720 --> 03:42:08.880]  these other people this article that's on Politico Goldman Sachs contributions
[03:42:08.880 --> 03:42:13.320]  surge despite attacks they say Goldman Sachs is on track to be one of the
[03:42:13.320 --> 03:42:17.720]  biggest contributors on the presidential race again this year with $800,000
[03:42:17.720 --> 03:42:21.760]  chipped in so far they said but of course they've spread their allegiances
[03:42:21.760 --> 03:42:24.840]  across the political map of course they would that's the way these guys do they
[03:42:24.840 --> 03:42:29.080]  fund all the people they believe they can control they give them all money
[03:42:29.080 --> 03:42:33.080]  they're hedging their bets they say top contributors for Republican they've
[03:42:33.080 --> 03:42:36.800]  been one of the top contributors for Republican campaigns of Jeb Bush Marco
[03:42:36.800 --> 03:42:42.160]  Rubio and of course Ted Cruz and they're a big contributor to Hillary Clinton
[03:42:42.160 --> 03:42:49.480]  they doled out $675,000 to her in speaking fees after she left office
[03:42:49.480 --> 03:42:53.440]  that's money of course that she gets directly they give it to a super PAC
[03:42:53.440 --> 03:42:57.720]  it could create problems for her if she tries to launder that money in some way
[03:42:57.720 --> 03:43:00.640]  to get out of the super PAC but if they give you speaking fees that's the way
[03:43:00.640 --> 03:43:03.320]  they've done it for the Clintons typically then give you a million bucks
[03:43:03.320 --> 03:43:08.320]  and it doesn't really raise any red flags with the FEC and of course we've
[03:43:08.320 --> 03:43:12.520]  talked about Ted Cruz's situation with Goldman Sachs his wife is a major
[03:43:12.520 --> 03:43:17.560]  executive there Trump said when he was speaking Goldman Sachs owns Cruz
[03:43:17.560 --> 03:43:21.880]  remember that folks he said they own him and they go on to point out that
[03:43:21.880 --> 03:43:27.120]  Goldman Sachs was the second biggest money source for Barack Obama the second
[03:43:27.120 --> 03:43:33.000]  biggest money source for Hillary Clinton see these banks want to make sure that
[03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:37.200]  they're open borders that their destruction of national sovereignty they
[03:43:37.200 --> 03:43:41.520]  want to pull down the open borders bring in massive numbers of immigrants and
[03:43:41.520 --> 03:43:45.040]  they want to consolidate everything we've talked about this that's what's
[03:43:45.040 --> 03:43:49.760]  behind fundamentally these Trans-Pacific transatlantic partnership agreements
[03:43:49.760 --> 03:43:54.640]  the things that Eric Cantor and the GOP establishment are so concerned that
[03:43:54.640 --> 03:43:59.120]  they're not stopped and I don't know if a Donald Trump would stop that or not he
[03:43:59.120 --> 03:44:02.960]  hasn't spoken out on it he thinks it's a bad deal but he hasn't said that he
[03:44:02.960 --> 03:44:07.200]  thinks it's a bad deal in principle and that concerns me nevertheless look at
[03:44:07.200 --> 03:44:11.440]  what Goldman Sachs is also doing in Britain they have donated hundreds of
[03:44:11.440 --> 03:44:17.320]  thousands of pounds to the campaign keep Britain in the European Union this is
[03:44:17.320 --> 03:44:21.120]  Sky News exclusively revealing Goldman Sachs has agreed to give what
[03:44:21.120 --> 03:44:27.800]  insiders say was a substantial six figure sum to keeping the UK and the EU
[03:44:27.800 --> 03:44:31.640]  they're very concerned they don't want that to come down this is what they are
[03:44:31.640 --> 03:44:34.640]  building they're building regional consolidations as we pointed out before
[03:44:34.640 --> 03:44:39.680]  consolidating Europe together into a an economic trading block then moving that
[03:44:39.680 --> 03:44:44.840]  into a political sovereignty and of course we've seen that also being done
[03:44:44.840 --> 03:44:49.400]  controlling the population by massive immigration and open borders doing the
[03:44:49.400 --> 03:44:54.440]  same thing in America as well and then once they create the North American
[03:44:54.440 --> 03:44:59.120]  Union the European Union then they pull them together again economically with
[03:44:59.120 --> 03:45:04.480]  these trade agreements which are really trade treaties and anybody who voted for
[03:45:04.480 --> 03:45:08.680]  these trade treaties people like Ted Cruz even though he voted once for the
[03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:14.040]  trade the trade promotion authority and then voted against it when it was
[03:45:14.040 --> 03:45:18.440]  clearly going to win if you vote for the trade promotion authority for the
[03:45:18.440 --> 03:45:22.200]  Trans Pacific transatlantic partnership and several other agreements that are on
[03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:26.680]  the table this is giving a blank check to the administration for six years to
[03:45:26.680 --> 03:45:31.440]  bring anything that they wish in and ram this thing through without amendment
[03:45:31.440 --> 03:45:37.240]  without discussion without debate without filibuster these are treaties and
[03:45:37.240 --> 03:45:41.000]  anybody who voted for this trade promotion authority and again that the
[03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:44.520]  Trans Pacific partnership transatlantic partnership none of these things have
[03:45:44.520 --> 03:45:48.520]  come up for a vote yet but when they voted for the trade promotion authority
[03:45:48.520 --> 03:45:53.720]  what they voted to do was to remove the constitutional process that said you
[03:45:53.720 --> 03:45:58.680]  needed to have two-thirds of the Senate vote for a new treaty these trade
[03:45:58.680 --> 03:46:03.720]  agreements are treaties NAFTA was a treaty the people who are are who
[03:46:03.720 --> 03:46:07.800]  represent trade disputes and arbitration I think all these lawyers if you look at
[03:46:07.800 --> 03:46:11.600]  their sites they talk about themselves as being treaty lawyers everybody knows
[03:46:11.600 --> 03:46:17.640]  that's a treaty it's clearly a treaty these Trans Pacific partnerships so even
[03:46:17.640 --> 03:46:20.240]  if they want to call them that they are treaties they were written by
[03:46:20.240 --> 03:46:23.920]  corporations and they're going to be rammed through without the constitutional
[03:46:23.920 --> 03:46:27.800]  process to ratify a treaty but they are treaties and anybody who voted for that
[03:46:27.800 --> 03:46:32.040]  TPA has absolutely no respect for the Constitution that they merely use as a
[03:46:32.040 --> 03:46:35.400]  beard let's understand that I mean how many different ways do we have to point
[03:46:35.400 --> 03:46:40.400]  out that the Constitution is a dead letter nevertheless they salute it they
[03:46:40.400 --> 03:46:44.240]  swear to it they hold it up and tell you this is something that is going to
[03:46:44.240 --> 03:46:49.160]  protect you now as we're looking at what Goldman Sachs is doing Goldman Sachs is
[03:46:49.160 --> 03:46:53.160]  very concerned they're not happy they're putting their money behind the
[03:46:53.160 --> 03:46:56.600]  establishment candidates in both parties we see the people at Davos saying
[03:46:56.600 --> 03:47:01.200]  we got a we're very concerned about Trump it's going to be very chaotic if he
[03:47:01.200 --> 03:47:03.740]  gets in there yeah they're not worried about the chaos that they're inflicting
[03:47:03.740 --> 03:47:08.000]  on Europe by massive migration of Muslims but they're very concerned that
[03:47:08.000 --> 03:47:11.320]  somebody they don't control could get in and so what we see happening here is
[03:47:11.320 --> 03:47:15.840]  interestingly enough we've seen the UK Parliament last week debating for three
[03:47:15.840 --> 03:47:19.800]  hours whether Donald Trump ought to be declared persona nongrata not allowed
[03:47:19.800 --> 03:47:24.960]  into their country now we see Alex Salmon who is a former Scottish national
[03:47:24.960 --> 03:47:30.240]  party leader trying to challenge Trump to a debate taunting him because he's
[03:47:30.240 --> 03:47:36.160]  not debating let me explain something to the globalists in the UK we settled the
[03:47:36.160 --> 03:47:40.840]  argument over a couple hundred years ago back in 1776 we settled the argument
[03:47:40.840 --> 03:47:45.720]  that you don't get to have any say so in our politics okay we could care less
[03:47:45.720 --> 03:47:50.800]  about the fact that you debate about somebody being allowed to have free
[03:47:50.800 --> 03:47:53.800]  speech for three hours in your parliament you want to waste your time
[03:47:53.800 --> 03:47:58.160]  doing that go ahead who cares okay you want to say that you want to challenge
[03:47:58.160 --> 03:48:02.440]  him to a debate on whatever who cares he didn't have to debate you cares what
[03:48:02.440 --> 03:48:07.560]  this guy Alex Salmon has anybody in the US heard his name before I just mentioned
[03:48:07.560 --> 03:48:11.880]  it here he's a nobody why would anybody waste their time on that nevertheless as
[03:48:11.880 --> 03:48:15.160]  we see what they're doing with this it is the same sort of thing that they're
[03:48:15.160 --> 03:48:18.960]  doing to Putin right now you see how they manipulate the media I think it's
[03:48:18.960 --> 03:48:22.560]  very interesting to look at how they manipulate the media we now have this
[03:48:22.560 --> 03:48:30.440]  10-year-old case of Litviniko who was clearly murdered now they're pulling
[03:48:30.440 --> 03:48:37.440]  this out after 10 years and saying Putin approved this Putin is had strict
[03:48:37.440 --> 03:48:41.080]  involvement in this he was personally involved in this some way after 10
[03:48:41.080 --> 03:48:46.520]  years this is what we're talking about about the very dangerous revival of the
[03:48:46.520 --> 03:48:52.560]  Cold War and this is all coming out of the desperation at Davos going back to
[03:48:52.560 --> 03:48:56.200]  that first article I talked about where we talked about the specter of Donald
[03:48:56.200 --> 03:49:01.320]  Trump is haunting Davos know the people who can who together collectively are
[03:49:01.320 --> 03:49:05.120]  specter are concerned about what's going on and they're concerned about
[03:49:05.120 --> 03:49:08.360]  politicians good or bad I'm saying that Trump's a good guy I'm not saying
[03:49:08.360 --> 03:49:11.760]  Putin's a good guy okay a lot of things I don't like about either one of them
[03:49:11.760 --> 03:49:17.120]  they're concerned though about anybody that they don't control and they're
[03:49:17.120 --> 03:49:20.680]  concerned because they're afraid they're going to lose control as the economy
[03:49:20.680 --> 03:49:26.280]  starts to spiral down as we start to see automation take more than half of the
[03:49:26.280 --> 03:49:30.920]  jobs and one of the things that they're going to do to control us is a control
[03:49:30.920 --> 03:49:35.680]  grid of your transportation they're going to track you everything that you do
[03:49:35.680 --> 03:49:39.960]  go back to what we were talking about with Jade Helm mastering the human
[03:49:39.960 --> 03:49:44.440]  domain what was the basis of that geospatial intelligence the fastest
[03:49:44.440 --> 03:49:48.480]  growing area of intelligence that our government has had it's composed of
[03:49:48.480 --> 03:49:53.680]  things like activity-based intelligence human domain analytics it's the metadata
[03:49:53.680 --> 03:49:57.840]  stupid that's what they really want even though you got James Clapper and others
[03:49:57.840 --> 03:50:00.800]  saying well you know we're not recording your conversations we're just
[03:50:00.800 --> 03:50:04.840]  getting your metadata that is more important than your conversation it's
[03:50:04.840 --> 03:50:10.360]  more easy to it's more easily mind than your conversations and so that's
[03:50:10.360 --> 03:50:14.320]  fundamentally what they're about when they impose this massive control and
[03:50:14.320 --> 03:50:17.400]  surveillance grid remember they're talked about at Davos again they were
[03:50:17.400 --> 03:50:21.240]  talking about how they're going to use self-driving cars as surveillance tools
[03:50:21.240 --> 03:50:27.040]  like drones and satellites okay the self-driving robot cars the vehicle to
[03:50:27.040 --> 03:50:30.000]  vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure communication that you're going to be
[03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:34.160]  forced to buy understand that just as they remove these regulations for
[03:50:34.160 --> 03:50:37.560]  self-driving cars for Silicon Valley give them subsidies they're going to
[03:50:37.560 --> 03:50:40.800]  mandate that within a couple of years you're going to put these things in your
[03:50:40.800 --> 03:50:48.520]  car they're looking at a 46 billion dollar industry by 2020 2020 okay less
[03:50:48.520 --> 03:50:52.320]  than four years they're gonna be making 46 billion dollars so we get the mandates
[03:50:52.320 --> 03:50:56.320]  we get the fees they get the subsidies they get the regulations taken off stay
[03:50:56.320 --> 03:51:02.520]  with us we'll be right back my name is Don whiskin and at 42 years old I

[03:55:25.440 --> 03:55:28.360]  tonight what's coming up well I tell you we got a lots to cover but I'm gonna tell
[03:55:28.360 --> 03:55:31.800]  you just a portion of what we're gonna cover tonight and and I've never done
[03:55:31.800 --> 03:55:36.080]  this before but I've noticed you know for the past couple years a lot of memes
[03:55:36.080 --> 03:55:40.520]  right on on social media on Facebook and they're always interesting to look at
[03:55:40.520 --> 03:55:45.120]  and one caught my attention the other day and I'm I'm actually going to go
[03:55:45.120 --> 03:55:47.680]  through and break it down if you guys could pull it up right now and this is
[03:55:47.680 --> 03:55:52.800]  about after Obama's been in the White House for seven years right and this is
[03:55:52.800 --> 03:55:57.160]  a meme that's very popular right now and it says you still have your guns you
[03:55:57.160 --> 03:56:02.440]  don't live in FEMA camps you don't have government implants and you don't live
[03:56:02.440 --> 03:56:08.040]  under Sharia law there's still no such thing as a death panel gay marriage
[03:56:08.040 --> 03:56:13.520]  hasn't ruined the country you've seen the birth certificate and he still hasn't
[03:56:13.520 --> 03:56:21.440]  risen as the antichrist do you feel like a dumbass yet right so I and I just
[03:56:21.440 --> 03:56:24.680]  think it's very interesting and what a bullet point list that is I mean how do
[03:56:24.680 --> 03:56:28.640]  you respond to that so I'm gonna actually break it down bullet by bullet and
[03:56:28.640 --> 03:56:31.640]  kind of just talk about that and I think we're a lot closer on every one of those
[03:56:31.640 --> 03:56:36.000]  bullet points coming true after he wants to be ahead of the UN right so if
[03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:39.880]  he's not the antichrist yet I guess give him time we're talking about memes I saw
[03:56:39.880 --> 03:56:43.680]  this the story about Bernie Sanders of course they're saying he's just too white
[03:56:43.680 --> 03:56:48.320]  but they're also talking about how he's got a new ad that's going to Simon and
[03:56:48.320 --> 03:56:53.240]  Garfunkels America and you know it really goes in and channels this hippie
[03:56:53.240 --> 03:56:56.940]  nostalgia which is really what's driving Bernie you know more so than his
[03:56:56.940 --> 03:57:02.000]  whiteness you know going back to the 1960s and he really is still stuck you
[03:57:02.000 --> 03:57:05.040]  know I guess they could go in and try to make him not quite as white instead of
[03:57:05.040 --> 03:57:09.040]  you know bringing in the director of Straight Outta Compton or something but
[03:57:09.040 --> 03:57:12.920]  this is a guy who is straight out of Nicaragua and the Santa Nistas that's
[03:57:12.920 --> 03:57:20.600]  why I call him Bernie Sanders. He really is like a Che Guevara t-shirt you know
[03:57:20.600 --> 03:57:26.280]  he hasn't learned anything since the 1960s he hasn't learned anything from the
[03:57:26.280 --> 03:57:30.680]  failures of the Central American countries he hasn't learned anything from
[03:57:30.680 --> 03:57:35.680]  the crony capitalism that was imposed by those Marxist dictators he thinks and
[03:57:35.680 --> 03:57:38.280]  tells everybody unfortunately that the only place you're going to get crony
[03:57:38.280 --> 03:57:43.600]  capitalism is on Wall Street no Wall Street operates through people like Hugo
[03:57:43.600 --> 03:57:49.920]  Chavez absolutely he gave them 700% ROI okay return on their investment at the
[03:57:49.920 --> 03:57:53.600]  same time Bloomberg is saying that it hey we got there they've been a great
[03:57:53.600 --> 03:57:57.120]  investment for us even though their people can't get food water and medicine
[03:57:57.120 --> 03:58:01.160]  but he also knows he has a very naive following yeah you know and a lot of
[03:58:01.160 --> 03:58:03.960]  people are just aren't especially the younger population they haven't they
[03:58:03.960 --> 03:58:07.720]  don't have a clue David that's right so maybe they have a dual t-shirt with a
[03:58:07.720 --> 03:58:13.640]  che and Bernie I don't know well that's it for today's radio broadcast join
[03:58:13.640 --> 03:58:38.880]  Darren tonight at 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern for the nightly news
