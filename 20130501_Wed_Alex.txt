[00:58.040 --> 01:02.720]  of what's coming up in the show today we've got three guests for you we've got
[01:02.720 --> 01:09.280]  Jeffrey John after Heidi with some news about a vaccine refuse Nick tracking app

[01:19.320 --> 01:26.040]  interview with Wayne Allen root author of the ultimate Obama survival guide you
[01:26.040 --> 01:30.920]  got to love the title how to survive thrive and prosper during Obama get in
[01:30.920 --> 01:36.480]  I saw that title I just had to invite this guy on the show and I've never
[01:36.480 --> 01:40.520]  interviewed him before but it should be really interesting he's got a lot of
[01:40.520 --> 01:46.160]  great recommendations like a a one-year income tax holiday for all taxpayers
[01:46.160 --> 01:50.240]  in America I mean how can you not love that idea so we're gonna have Wayne
[01:50.240 --> 01:53.320]  Allen root on in the second hour and then in the third hour today we're gonna
[01:53.320 --> 01:58.840]  have Dr. Busby the expert on radiation with some very important updates on
[01:58.840 --> 02:03.480]  Fukushima there is radiation spiking in the soils let's see we've got some more
[02:03.480 --> 02:08.480]  breaking news on that over here we get to that in the third hour but a lot's
[02:08.480 --> 02:13.640]  happening with Fukushima and as usual you are not being told the truth about
[02:13.640 --> 02:20.440]  Fukushima about the radiation that's coming to America now in terms of the
[02:20.440 --> 02:23.920]  news we're gonna break down the news between now and the time that all of
[02:23.920 --> 02:29.560]  these guests come on board and we've got a lot of breaking news here so I'm just
[02:29.560 --> 02:32.440]  gonna run down some of the headlines right now and then after we come back
[02:32.440 --> 02:38.680]  from the next break we'll get into the actual details but we've got millions
[02:38.680 --> 02:44.440]  are on welfare in America who are not citizens of America that's been a big
[02:44.440 --> 02:47.800]  breaking story over the past couple of days but some new information came out
[02:47.800 --> 02:55.040]  yesterday from Judicial Watch where there are now apparently workers in the
[02:55.040 --> 02:59.000]  welfare system who are speaking out and saying that they there were quote van
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.760]  loads of benefits handed out to illegal immigrants and that the local office was
[03:05.760 --> 03:10.520]  given a quota said you have to hand out this this much benefit you know quote
[03:10.520 --> 03:15.080]  benefit free money to people otherwise we're gonna yank your budget so they
[03:15.080 --> 03:19.520]  just began basically throwing money at anybody who would walk through the door
[03:19.520 --> 03:23.600]  who could fill out a form and sign it they're just throwing money at them
[03:23.600 --> 03:28.400]  because that's of course how the welfare state really works so we got that
[03:28.400 --> 03:34.360]  story coming up we've got 42% of the American people according to a poll are
[03:34.360 --> 03:40.720]  unaware that Obamacare is law unaware yeah you talk about I mean sometimes we
[03:40.720 --> 03:47.000]  joke we talk about the the zombification of the masses in America and you see
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.400]  those things like when Mark Dice did that piece about people signing the petition
[03:51.400 --> 03:57.000]  to usher in a Nazi-style police state well now 42% of Americans are
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.920]  unaware that Obamacare is law they have no clue what planet they're on okay they
[04:02.920 --> 04:09.080]  don't even know they don't know probably you know who's their senator who who's
[04:09.080 --> 04:12.720]  their congressperson they have no clue what is going on they're not aware of
[04:12.720 --> 04:17.400]  reality they have no cognitive function we'll get to that later here's some
[04:17.400 --> 04:20.880]  other stories we have coming up here on the Alex Jones show genetically modified
[04:20.880 --> 04:26.720]  wheat could permanently damage human genetics by silencing hundreds of genes
[04:26.720 --> 04:31.440]  throughout the body this is a whole new level of information warfare it's
[04:31.440 --> 04:36.240]  genetic information warfare we'll talk about that got a couple of stories that
[04:36.240 --> 04:40.840]  I put up about control versus empowerment and how to tell whether people are
[04:40.840 --> 04:44.960]  really evil or good we'll go into that it's in it's a very important
[04:44.960 --> 04:50.840]  philosophical shortcut you might say and then we've got 10 trends that are
[04:50.840 --> 04:55.760]  driving America into social and spiritual crisis we're gonna cover that here in
[04:55.760 --> 04:59.480]  the next segment stay with us this is Mike Adams on the Alex Jones show we'll

[08:11.880 --> 08:14.400]  network
[08:17.400 --> 08:24.280]  welcome to the Alex Jones show this is Wednesday May 1st 2013 and this is Mike
[08:24.280 --> 08:28.480]  Adams the health ranger sitting in guest hosting for Alex today yes you are in
[08:28.480 --> 08:33.280]  the right place if you're listening to the Alex Jones show and I got to say
[08:33.280 --> 08:38.560]  I'm in a great mood I'm in a great mood today because we are winning the info
[08:38.560 --> 08:45.600]  war on so many fronts it's astonishing the the the the liberal media I can call
[08:45.600 --> 08:53.000]  liberal the the leftist lying mainstream media is in total desperation all the
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.840]  stories that they wanted to cover up and and sweep under the rug have been
[08:56.840 --> 09:02.040]  exposed by info wars and and other alternative news people you know Matt
[09:02.040 --> 09:07.760]  drudge and to some extent my site and others it's we're winning on so many
[09:07.760 --> 09:11.080]  fronts that that they're just backpedaling now they just have to they
[09:11.080 --> 09:15.680]  have to deny that they did deny because their denials have been exposed as total
[09:15.680 --> 09:20.000]  lies you know with the DHS bullets that they said didn't exist and now the whole
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.440]  story about the Boston Marathon bombing is is all falling apart you know I was
[09:25.440 --> 09:28.600]  I was talking to the crew before the show I was like I want to make sure let's
[09:28.600 --> 09:33.280]  fact check this that the the alleged Boston Marathon bomber who was found in
[09:33.280 --> 09:38.720]  the boat he was unarmed right I mean he didn't have a gun right and they said
[09:38.720 --> 09:42.800]  right and they brought up the news piece to confirm that he didn't have a gun he
[09:42.800 --> 09:47.760]  was unarmed and yet I remember the the description of the police encounter was
[09:47.760 --> 09:53.480]  that they quote exchanged fire they exchanged fire how do you exchange fire
[09:53.480 --> 10:00.200]  with an unarmed person and CJ says I think the police were exchanging fire
[10:00.200 --> 10:06.080]  with each other which is almost certainly the the accurate assessment of
[10:06.080 --> 10:12.120]  the situation they were shooting each other okay the police the cops the FBI
[10:12.120 --> 10:15.760]  you name it whoever's on the scene they were shooting each other and they were
[10:15.760 --> 10:21.360]  imagining that they were in a gunfight with a terrorist who probably had
[10:21.360 --> 10:25.360]  nothing to do with this other than being told he was performing a drill for the
[10:25.360 --> 10:30.400]  CIA so the whole story just completely unravels the whole thing falls apart
[10:30.400 --> 10:34.520]  yeah there's there they're showing the cop that was shot probably you know so
[10:34.520 --> 10:39.760]  called friendly fire the all the lies are unraveling is my point and today on
[10:39.760 --> 10:43.160]  the show by the way I should introduce the guests we have coming up just so you
[10:43.160 --> 10:48.720]  know but we're gonna unravel even more of the liberal media leftist media lies
[10:48.720 --> 10:52.560]  excuse me I gotta stop using the word liberal just doesn't it doesn't fit
[10:52.560 --> 10:57.200]  anymore anyway here's who we have coming up we've got the bottom of this hour
[10:57.200 --> 11:01.120]  we've got Jeffrey John Alfter Heidi from vactruth.com he's gonna be
[11:01.120 --> 11:05.800]  giving us some breaking news just in a short segment about a new vaccine
[11:05.800 --> 11:10.640]  refusers tracking application yeah if you refuse vaccines you're gonna be
[11:10.640 --> 11:16.000]  tracked like a fugitive hey maybe the cops will exchange fire with you too for
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.920]  refusing vaccines even though you don't have a gun that's the new thing oh I you
[11:20.920 --> 11:25.520]  gotta love the word games of the new police state okay so we we exchange
[11:25.520 --> 11:31.280]  fire with an unarmed man and the town was in a state of quote lockdown and
[11:31.280 --> 11:37.920]  everybody was supposed to quote shelter in place yeah it's not martial law no
[11:37.920 --> 11:41.080]  don't worry folks there's no martial law happening here you're just supposed
[11:41.080 --> 11:47.000]  to shelter in place which means stay in your home until we drag you out of your
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.320]  home at gunpoint so so shelter in place until we knock on your door and then
[11:53.320 --> 11:57.640]  come out with your hands up and as Ron Paul rightly said he's more concerned
[11:57.640 --> 12:02.400]  about the police state reaction to the bombing than he was about the bombing
[12:02.400 --> 12:08.680]  itself and that's that's accurate yes Ron Paul you are right yet again I mean
[12:08.680 --> 12:12.080]  we should be we should be a lot more worried about police rolling up and
[12:12.080 --> 12:16.280]  down the streets with their armored assault vehicles and pointing their
[12:16.280 --> 12:21.600]  loaded rifles at people in their homes who are taking photos out of second
[12:21.600 --> 12:25.200]  story windows we should be a lot more concerned about those people than any
[12:25.200 --> 12:29.480]  so-called you know bombers or terrorists or people running around with
[12:29.480 --> 12:33.840]  pressure cookers and oh by the way we have another story we're gonna play a
[12:33.840 --> 12:40.960]  video later on about a so-called activist chick who went on to a college
[12:40.960 --> 12:44.760]  campus and got a bunch of college students to sign a petition banning
[12:44.760 --> 12:51.400]  pressure cookers because the pressure cookers are apparently so evil they're
[12:51.400 --> 12:56.040]  so incredibly evil you know cooking utensils what wasn't there a school
[12:56.040 --> 13:01.640]  teacher who was suspended from his job last week for bringing garden tools to
[13:01.640 --> 13:07.720]  school to show his students how you garden yeah because I guess I guess these
[13:07.720 --> 13:13.440]  garden tools a little shovel a little rake they're their evil terrorist
[13:13.440 --> 13:17.840]  weapons unbelievable yeah there there it is a teacher suspended for showing
[13:17.840 --> 13:22.800]  gardening tools to class look how evil those gardening tools are it's a pair of
[13:22.800 --> 13:30.560]  scissors it's a it's a what is it a like a pitchfork a small pitchfork and now
[13:30.560 --> 13:35.640]  pressure cookers are evil too and in fact as I recall the manufacturer of
[13:35.640 --> 13:39.360]  pressure cookers want one of the manufacturers actually pulled their
[13:39.360 --> 13:44.200]  pressure cookers off the shelves Williams and Sonoma thank you guys they
[13:44.200 --> 13:49.280]  pulled it off the shelves temporarily before realizing what morons they were
[13:49.280 --> 13:54.040]  and then reversing their recall and putting the pressure cookers back on
[13:54.040 --> 14:00.000]  the shelves I you know here's what's probably sooner or later somebody is
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.480]  going to commit murder with a blender you know they're gonna run up and down the
[14:05.480 --> 14:11.280]  marathon with a blender you know like the the Vitamix murderer or whatever you
[14:11.280 --> 14:14.480]  know nothing is Vitamix actually Vitamix is a great product but they're
[14:14.480 --> 14:18.560]  gonna they're gonna be like the Vitamix rampage and then there's gonna be a
[14:18.560 --> 14:23.400]  call the band Vitamix is because someone used them in some kind of atrocious
[14:23.400 --> 14:28.440]  horrific crime there is no physical object that is safe from the irrational
[14:28.440 --> 14:33.160]  insanity of the radical left believe me you know you stab someone with a pencil
[14:33.160 --> 14:36.560]  they want to ban pencils you hit somebody over the head with a laptop I
[14:36.560 --> 14:41.360]  want to ban all laptops you know it's just it's incredible they're incredible
[14:41.360 --> 14:45.680]  infatuation with inanimate objects is just beyond comprehension I can't even
[14:45.680 --> 14:49.480]  get into it but getting back to I promise you some of the guests here that
[14:49.480 --> 14:53.400]  are coming up today so here's who we've got in the second hour I'm sorry I can't
[14:53.400 --> 14:57.760]  stop laughing it's also funny it's so it's so ridiculous but in the second
[14:57.760 --> 15:02.000]  hour we've got Wayne Allen root the author of the ultimate Obama survival
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  guide what a great title how to survive thrive and prosper during Obama
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.600]  Geddon I love it I love it a guy who writes a title like that he gets on the
[15:12.600 --> 15:16.320]  show all right that's all there is to it you write a title that good you're on
[15:16.320 --> 15:21.160]  the show period so I saw the book on Amazon and I said we got to get this
[15:21.160 --> 15:24.760]  guy on the show Wayne Allen root will join us in the second hour and then in
[15:24.760 --> 15:28.600]  the third hour we've got dr. Busby the expert on Fukushima and radiation to
[15:28.600 --> 15:33.480]  give us the latest breaking news on how we're all being irradiated by a problem
[15:33.480 --> 15:38.920]  that the leftist media says doesn't exist I mean think about it hey the
[15:38.920 --> 15:44.040]  bullets don't exist let's see the the Bill of Rights doesn't exist and
[15:44.040 --> 15:51.680]  radiation doesn't exist and a building seven fell in the perfect demolition
[15:51.680 --> 15:55.360]  style footprint because it had a couple of office fires even though in the
[15:55.360 --> 15:58.720]  history of all buildings that are constructed out of concrete and steel
[15:58.720 --> 16:02.640]  and concrete doesn't melt at those temperatures by the way in the in the
[16:02.640 --> 16:06.640]  entire history of all such buildings only one building has ever fallen in its
[16:06.640 --> 16:11.960]  own perfect footprint like demolition and that was building seven so even
[16:11.960 --> 16:16.840]  invoking the laws of physics my friends invoking the laws of physics makes you
[16:16.840 --> 16:22.000]  a conspiracy theorist yes if you understand thermodynamics and
[16:22.000 --> 16:27.760]  architectural engineering a compression strength of concrete and the torsion
[16:27.760 --> 16:33.800]  resistance of rebar if you understand these things you are a conspiracy
[16:33.800 --> 16:39.720]  theorist according to people like Rachel Maddow oh my god they don't get me
[16:39.720 --> 16:46.760]  laughing on that person oh my god okay let's get out of the news I'm sorry I'm
[16:46.760 --> 16:50.480]  sorry I'm just too excited today but here's let's get out of some of the
[16:50.480 --> 16:56.120]  news I brought a bunch of news to go over it GM wheat let's start with this
[16:56.120 --> 17:00.440]  one genetically modified wheat could permanently damage human genetics by
[17:00.440 --> 17:05.640]  silencing hundreds of genes throughout the body and it turns out that the GM
[17:05.640 --> 17:11.440]  wheat may be able to transmit its defects through multiple generations of
[17:11.440 --> 17:16.360]  humans so now by the way GM wheat is not yet commercialized so I don't want to
[17:16.360 --> 17:21.680]  raise alarm over wheat if you go by wheat right now it's not GMO okay just to be
[17:21.680 --> 17:25.320]  clear but they're trying to commercialize GM wheat they're trying to get the
[17:25.320 --> 17:30.420]  USDA to approve it and of course the USDA loves Monsanto and so does Obama so
[17:30.420 --> 17:35.280]  they're gonna say yeah thumbs up go for more GMOs in in the environment and in
[17:35.280 --> 17:38.840]  the food supply pretty soon if they get their way we're gonna have GM wheat and
[17:38.840 --> 17:44.760]  then we're gonna have a bunch of our genes turned off like turning off you
[17:44.760 --> 17:48.420]  know the biological switches that control everything in your body how
[17:48.420 --> 17:53.920]  wonderful is that just another way to deactivate humanity anyway that's
[17:53.920 --> 17:59.040]  that's a check out that story I think it's up at infowars.com as well getting
[17:59.040 --> 18:06.880]  to other news we've got illegal aliens are collecting food stamps now I wrote
[18:06.880 --> 18:11.840]  about this earlier in the week and it's true that the USDA and by the way
[18:11.840 --> 18:17.840]  thanks goes to judicial watch for this story judicialwatch.org and they
[18:17.840 --> 18:20.940]  filed Freedom of Information Act requests they got these documents that
[18:20.940 --> 18:28.480]  proved the Obama administration the USDA under Obama was pushing food stamps to
[18:28.480 --> 18:35.200]  illegals in Mexico saying you can sign up for food stamps and get the free food
[18:35.200 --> 18:39.720]  credit from the US government and we won't check your immigration status how
[18:39.720 --> 18:44.760]  wonderful is that and by the way on food stamps did you know what you can buy you
[18:44.760 --> 18:49.960]  can buy a diet soda with aspartame you can buy regular soda you can buy lobster
[18:49.960 --> 18:54.440]  you can buy porterhouse steaks all the steak and lobster you want you can buy
[18:54.440 --> 18:59.680]  it all on the the USDA food stamp program which is called the snap program
[18:59.680 --> 19:03.440]  because apparently somebody there snapped and decided to start giving away all
[19:03.440 --> 19:08.360]  the all Americans money to illegals who never even paid a dime of tax into the
[19:08.360 --> 19:12.360]  system ever in their whole lives so you can buy all these things but guess what
[19:12.360 --> 19:17.120]  you can't buy on the federal food stamp program you can't buy vitamins you can't
[19:17.120 --> 19:20.680]  buy nutrition you can't buy superfoods because they don't want you to be
[19:20.680 --> 19:26.560]  nourished they want you to be a victim I want you to be a dependent on the system
[19:26.560 --> 19:30.960]  and guess who makes money off the food stamp program JP Morgan Chase and all
[19:30.960 --> 19:34.920]  the other big banks that actually process all those transactions to the
[19:34.920 --> 19:41.000]  tune of millions of dollars a year in profits for those banks while Obama gets
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.080]  to recruit a bunch of people that might get amnesty so they can vote more
[19:44.080 --> 19:48.480]  Democrats into office as they're collecting free food stamp money from
[19:48.480 --> 19:51.360]  the government how wonderful is that stay with us we'll be right back after
[19:51.360 --> 19:54.360]  this break with much more

[24:17.480 --> 24:20.960]  ranger filling in for Alex today thank you for joining us as we continue to
[24:20.960 --> 24:25.560]  break down all the ways that we are winning the Info War by just telling
[24:25.560 --> 24:28.800]  the truth it's so simple we just tell the truth now on this issue that I was
[24:28.800 --> 24:34.160]  talking about before we went to break you know millions and I don't know how
[24:34.160 --> 24:38.000]  many maybe tens of millions of dollars probably a lot more if you think about it
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.880]  are being handed out in food stamps to illegals in America now when I wrote
[24:42.880 --> 24:47.800]  this story and I posted it on Facebook just to just get it out there and even
[24:47.800 --> 24:53.440]  knowing that you know I was gonna get completely bashed by these deranged
[24:53.440 --> 24:58.000]  Facebook users and the first thing they said is well you can't call them
[24:58.000 --> 25:03.640]  illegals you can't call them that you have to be politically correct otherwise
[25:03.640 --> 25:07.080]  everything you say is discredited if you call them illegals you have to call
[25:07.080 --> 25:14.040]  them quote undocumented citizens undocumented citizens I said well how
[25:14.040 --> 25:19.760]  does how is that because first of all they did come into the country illegally
[25:19.760 --> 25:25.320]  and secondly they're not citizens of this country so I can't you know sneak
[25:25.320 --> 25:30.000]  into Mexico and then just run around and get food stamps from the Mexican
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.120]  government and get free health care from the Mexican government and get a free
[25:33.120 --> 25:37.920]  education and then just say I'm not illegal I'm just undocumented I mean
[25:37.920 --> 25:42.440]  come on every other country in the world would would kick you out or at least
[25:42.440 --> 25:48.280]  not pay you a bunch of benefits that's the real insanity look I'm not against
[25:48.280 --> 25:54.000]  the you know the entire culture there's a lot to love about Latino culture and
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.040]  the Mexican people you know and I've lived in South America I'm just against
[25:57.040 --> 26:02.720]  us spending US taxpayer dollars to give them benefits when they're not even
[26:02.720 --> 26:10.680]  citizens I mean how simple is it how crazy is that so we're just telling the
[26:10.680 --> 26:17.400]  truth you know it gets you hated I guess by everybody today completely
[26:17.400 --> 26:22.200]  completely hated and now judicial watch says illegal aliens got food stamps by
[26:22.200 --> 26:26.160]  the vandal but just just to be clear I'm not against food stamps for American
[26:26.160 --> 26:30.640]  citizens who are in a temporary poverty crisis I'm not against that you know if
[26:30.640 --> 26:35.440]  we we can help some families out for a short-term period I'm all in favor of
[26:35.440 --> 26:38.720]  that I'd be happy to personally donate food to them that'd be better than
[26:38.720 --> 26:41.120]  actually than paying the money the federal government having them waste it
[26:41.120 --> 26:44.680]  I'd rather just give money to people who I mean give food to people who need it
[26:44.680 --> 26:48.400]  and I've done that actually in the past I've donated truckloads of food to the
[26:48.400 --> 26:52.920]  American Red Cross in Wyoming by the way I mean I've done things like that but
[26:52.920 --> 26:57.120]  to give away money to people who aren't even citizens it's an it's insane so so
[26:57.120 --> 27:03.000]  all of you haters and trolls out there you're wrong and you know it and if you
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.080]  keep the system going they're gonna come after your money and your house and
[27:07.080 --> 27:10.520]  your job and they're just gonna take everything and your bank account just
[27:10.520 --> 27:16.440]  gonna take it all so by the way switching topics here very quickly you know
[27:16.440 --> 27:22.040]  there's been a lot of confusion in in in the minds of people on the left a lot
[27:22.040 --> 27:28.760]  of confusion about when exactly is it okay to murder people and you know because
[27:28.760 --> 27:32.920]  they're not covering the abortion trial in Philadelphia because basically the
[27:32.920 --> 27:37.160]  leftist media says it's it's okay to kill babies not only before they're born
[27:37.160 --> 27:41.240]  but even right after they're born you know stab them in the neck with a pair
[27:41.240 --> 27:46.040]  of scissors or just jab you know jab them with sharp objects maybe garden
[27:46.040 --> 27:50.040]  tools who knows but it's okay the left says to kill the babies after they're
[27:50.040 --> 27:54.360]  born and you can even have post birth abortions but you know up to three years
[27:54.360 --> 27:58.600]  of age so it's okay to kill all those babies according to the left and but
[27:58.600 --> 28:02.560]  then once they go to grade school and they're in a place like Sandy Hook then
[28:02.560 --> 28:07.360]  you can't kill them anymore and if somebody does kill them then it's the
[28:07.360 --> 28:11.280]  end of the world and you have to take away all rights and all liberties to
[28:11.280 --> 28:15.840]  protect that child that apparently was perfectly okay to kill six years earlier
[28:15.840 --> 28:20.800]  if it was just called a choice all right so in order to clear up some of the
[28:20.800 --> 28:24.880]  confusion on this I did some research and I found a graphic called the
[28:24.880 --> 28:29.040]  collectivist guide to appropriate murder which is put out by the Democratic
[28:29.040 --> 28:32.920]  Party and we're going to show that on screen here on prisonplanet.tv for those
[28:32.920 --> 28:36.440]  of you watching I'm just going to run through this very quickly here is when
[28:36.440 --> 28:41.320]  it when is it appropriate to murder people according to the left all right
[28:41.320 --> 28:45.040]  so prenatal murder is perfectly acceptable that's called abortion that's
[28:45.040 --> 28:49.720]  called the choice you can just take them out done post birth abortion well
[28:49.720 --> 28:54.280]  that's also still a choice and who cares if this abortionist was you know
[28:54.280 --> 28:58.360]  severing the spinal columns of little babies that were breathing you know
[28:58.360 --> 29:02.760]  right after they're born just just you know slicing away right there the media
[29:02.760 --> 29:05.800]  doesn't think that's important to cover because they support it they love it
[29:05.800 --> 29:11.280]  they'd kill more babies that's totally okay infanticide yeah as it's called now
[29:11.280 --> 29:15.200]  then once the children become school age and then they're wearing backpacks and
[29:15.200 --> 29:18.600]  they have these cute little tennis shoes and they're going to school then they
[29:18.600 --> 29:23.320]  enter the cute zone you can't kill them anymore according to the left not okay
[29:23.320 --> 29:27.480]  not okay to kill them but after they turn 18 it's okay to kill them once again
[29:27.480 --> 29:32.440]  if they're in favor of conservatism or firearms ownership you go on the
[29:32.440 --> 29:35.720]  evening news and you can say shoot these people and everybody laughs about it
[29:35.720 --> 29:39.600]  like Pierce Morgan totally okay and when they're elderly you can kill them
[29:39.600 --> 29:44.800]  again because you got to have the death panels save taxpayer money run Obamacare
[29:44.800 --> 29:48.720]  yeah that's when it's okay to kill people according to the collectivist left I
[29:48.720 --> 29:54.240]  just wanted to clarify we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:54.240 --> 29:58.400]  and the GCN radio network

[33:21.080 --> 33:26.800]  naturalnews.com a frequent contributor to info wars.com and before we get on to
[33:26.800 --> 33:31.000]  our guest here let me just say by the way that last bit was obviously satire I
[33:31.000 --> 33:34.960]  hope I hope you know that I I was gonna mention that but then it went to
[33:34.960 --> 33:41.040]  commercial obviously sat obviously satire the left wouldn't would never
[33:41.040 --> 33:47.000]  admit that they support murder even though they do and by the way they you
[33:47.000 --> 33:50.680]  know this I just want to give thanks to the media that's actually covering the
[33:50.680 --> 33:57.160]  abortion murder trial so I want to give a shout out to cnsnews.com they've
[33:57.160 --> 34:01.800]  been really having great coverage of it I want to give a shout out to Breitbart
[34:01.800 --> 34:06.920]  obviously drudge report story leak has been doing some good work and they've
[34:06.920 --> 34:10.640]  just submitted a new video that I'm in for the Paul and Revere contest I didn't
[34:10.640 --> 34:14.600]  have any part in creating it but they interviewed me for it and that was just
[34:14.600 --> 34:18.400]  released last night I don't even really know the name disarmed that's the name
[34:18.400 --> 34:23.160]  disarmed so you can check that it's it's a it's a pretty hard-hitting a video
[34:23.160 --> 34:27.920]  about you know gun gun rights and he interviews Steve Toth the Texas
[34:27.920 --> 34:33.040]  representative who is really an awesome guy who gets it so I just want to give a
[34:33.040 --> 34:39.440]  shout out to all of these media sources alternative media that are doing such a
[34:39.440 --> 34:44.360]  great job out there I mean is rumor mill news there's Steve quail.com
[34:44.360 --> 34:49.320]  there's just so many I'm sorry if I'm leaving some out but there's there's so
[34:49.320 --> 34:52.000]  many great websites out there that are doing a good job so we we got to be
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.840]  thankful for them and of course info wars.com don't take all this for
[34:55.840 --> 35:00.240]  granted this could easily go away the government could easily come in and
[35:00.240 --> 35:04.520]  just sees all of these websites oh and by the way along those lines I remember a
[35:04.520 --> 35:08.280]  few months ago I talked about developing a peer-to-peer information
[35:08.280 --> 35:12.240]  distribution technology and I kind of dropped the ball on that I know some of
[35:12.240 --> 35:15.280]  you out there who are listeners were we're talking with me about that
[35:15.280 --> 35:19.560]  technically is a very very difficult project but there's possibly a breakthrough
[35:19.560 --> 35:23.560]  in that the BitTorrent company has just released a product called BitTorrent
[35:23.560 --> 35:28.300]  Sync and I'm checking that out right now to see if we can use a peer-to-peer
[35:28.300 --> 35:35.560]  sync to essentially distribute videos and articles and other content by dropping
[35:35.560 --> 35:39.560]  it into a local folder and having it sync peer-to-peer across all the other
[35:39.560 --> 35:44.000]  computers that that have the the same share link so I'm checking that out
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.200]  that's BitTorrent Sync if you want to check that out that that could be the
[35:47.200 --> 35:52.120]  answer to to what we do in the alternative media if the government tries
[35:52.120 --> 35:56.140]  to take down all of our websites we do need a peer-to-peer decentralized or
[35:56.140 --> 36:01.360]  non-centralized information sharing technology and that could be the answer
[36:01.360 --> 36:06.360]  so anyway a lot of you out there who are even more geeky than I am can
[36:06.360 --> 36:09.440]  probably figure that out and and get us some answers but we got to have a
[36:09.440 --> 36:13.160]  technology that that could be it now getting on to our first guest who's
[36:13.160 --> 36:17.960]  joining us just for a few minutes for an update on this his name is Jeffrey John
[36:17.960 --> 36:24.920]  Alff de Heidi he's the main contributor to vactruth.com yeah
[36:24.920 --> 36:31.240]  vactruth.com vac short for vaccine of course vactruth.com and Jeffrey I
[36:31.240 --> 36:33.840]  hope I got your name I hope I pronounce your name correctly you can correct me
[36:33.840 --> 36:38.160]  but he's a fantastic writer I've been following much of his work for many
[36:38.160 --> 36:44.400]  years and he just posted a story in the last day or two about a a tracking
[36:44.400 --> 36:49.080]  application I'm trying to find here it is the a tracking app that would allow
[36:49.080 --> 36:54.400]  the government to track vaccine refusers so here to give us the details on that
[36:54.400 --> 36:59.280]  story and why it's relevant to all of us and our health freedom is Jeffrey John
[36:59.280 --> 37:02.640]  Alff de Heidi that Jeffrey thank you for joining us hey thanks for having me on
[37:02.640 --> 37:05.920]  Mike I really appreciate the opportunity to be on the show you bet it's a
[37:05.920 --> 37:09.120]  pleasure to have you on how do I pronounce your name by the way I
[37:09.120 --> 37:14.400]  should know this you nailed it so you're one of a few oh really I nailed it oh okay all
[37:14.400 --> 37:18.960]  right well that's there's a first for everything so so go ahead tell us about
[37:18.960 --> 37:23.000]  the story yeah absolutely Mike so what we have here is an application that's
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.480]  called vaccine refused now on the surface that it appears to be you know
[37:27.480 --> 37:32.200]  pretty benign what it does is it actually tracks just pretty much what the
[37:32.200 --> 37:38.400]  name says the vaccine that is refused by by you if you go into a pediatrician's
[37:38.400 --> 37:44.000]  office or a doctor's office or whoever they can plug in the type of vaccine
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.720]  that you refuse if it's all of them or one or two some demographic information
[37:48.720 --> 37:53.880]  and the data is supposed to be stored anonymously at the University of Iowa
[37:53.880 --> 37:57.520]  so I started to dig into this as a matter of fact I just want to give give a
[37:57.520 --> 38:02.440]  shout out to to one of my colleagues Bonnie Stamerie for sending me this and
[38:02.440 --> 38:07.280]  I started to dig into this a little bit deeper and what I found out is that the
[38:07.280 --> 38:11.200]  lead researcher his name is dr. Philip Paul Green and he's the director of
[38:11.200 --> 38:16.320]  infectious disease societies of America's emerging infections network and so
[38:16.320 --> 38:21.120]  what that basically means is that the CDC has started a program since 1995 to
[38:21.120 --> 38:27.080]  work in cooperation with this this this society and what they're doing is they're
[38:27.080 --> 38:31.200]  basically developing this Sentinel network where they can report like
[38:31.200 --> 38:36.480]  emerging diseases or any developments in disease trends or you know something
[38:36.480 --> 38:43.080]  something similar to like prediction markets if you will well I don't think
[38:43.080 --> 38:46.280]  anybody has any problem with them tracking the emergence of disease but
[38:46.280 --> 38:50.040]  this this tracking of people who refuse to get vaccinated that's that's very
[38:50.040 --> 38:54.800]  worrisome that smacks of you know police state medicine yeah absolutely and so and
[38:54.800 --> 38:58.880]  so you know on the surface they say well we're all this data is anonymous all this
[38:58.880 --> 39:05.400]  data is you know it's safe and secure but okay so here's the deal that might be
[39:05.400 --> 39:09.920]  true to some degree but now we have to take a look at what else the Centers for
[39:09.920 --> 39:14.640]  Disease Control is in right so they're in for something also called the
[39:14.640 --> 39:19.480]  immunization information system and that registers all of your vaccine
[39:19.480 --> 39:23.280]  information into their databases and they have these programs that are that
[39:23.280 --> 39:28.200]  are being tied into these state database registry programs where they
[39:28.200 --> 39:33.320]  can track information such as your patient's first name your social
[39:33.320 --> 39:38.440]  security number your address your sex your mother's name you know if you're a
[39:38.440 --> 39:42.960]  child the vaccine type the vaccine manufacturer the lot number the vaccine
[39:42.960 --> 39:47.720]  provider so what's to say Mike that that vaccine provider being a doctor's office
[39:47.720 --> 39:53.120]  presses that button says this person refused and it correlates to that type
[39:53.120 --> 39:56.280]  of information now they can they can cross-reference it through a relational
[39:56.280 --> 40:00.480]  database check it's easy absolutely absolutely and I don't buy for one
[40:00.480 --> 40:04.160]  second that this stuff is anonymous because you know his name is Bruce
[40:04.160 --> 40:08.200]  Nyer and he writes this great op-ed piece called the internet is the internet
[40:08.200 --> 40:12.600]  is a surveillance state and he talks about three different examples he talks
[40:12.600 --> 40:16.160]  about Chinese military hackers who were implicated in a set of attacks
[40:16.160 --> 40:21.320]  against the government well they these these hackers access their Facebook
[40:21.320 --> 40:25.360]  account from the same infrastructure they carried out their attacks on or what
[40:25.360 --> 40:32.480]  about a hacker that was identified that he practiced excellent security practices
[40:32.480 --> 40:36.640]  and he slipped up a little bit and he goes caught by the FBI or about Paula
[40:36.640 --> 40:41.920]  Broadwell she's the one that had the affair with with director CIA director
[40:41.920 --> 40:48.640]  David Petraeus she used anonymous email accounts wherever she went from the
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.480]  hotels and the only commonality was is that she logged in from she was the
[40:53.480 --> 40:56.720]  only person that they could find that logged in from the hotel so they know
[40:56.720 --> 41:01.000]  how to correlate all the data right they they know how to do this and so it's a
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.840]  joke for them to say that everything's anonymous and we we're not gonna be
[41:03.840 --> 41:09.520]  tracking it so the the whole point behind this application is is that it has
[41:09.520 --> 41:15.680]  the ability to not only create heatmaps but also pinpoint exact locations you
[41:15.680 --> 41:19.760]  know again this is of course my opinion based on my experience but it has the
[41:19.760 --> 41:24.560]  ability to correlate your home address all that type of information and put on
[41:24.560 --> 41:29.420]  a nice little map so then the question becomes who gets that application who
[41:29.420 --> 41:33.320]  gets that phone application right and how how is it going to be applied
[41:33.320 --> 41:38.600]  because we know already that parents who refuse vaccines for the children often
[41:38.600 --> 41:43.920]  have their children kidnapped by CPS or you know taken away by the state
[41:43.920 --> 41:48.880]  essentially and that in addition we know that the medical police state is is
[41:48.880 --> 41:53.680]  rising under Obamacare it's gaining more power and that people who refuse
[41:53.680 --> 41:58.800]  vaccines could then be denied health care procedures oh yes the tip of the
[41:58.800 --> 42:02.640]  iceberg I mean let's take the mic let's just take a look at there was a
[42:02.640 --> 42:08.120]  recent study done by Frank DiStefano the director of immunization safety for
[42:08.120 --> 42:12.400]  the Centers for Disease Control they took data from Kaiser Permanente and tried
[42:12.400 --> 42:18.680]  to you know use it count antigens right as far as if it was if vaccines were
[42:18.680 --> 42:23.120]  going to cause autism now you know how does that kind of relate here well they
[42:23.120 --> 42:26.840]  already have at the tie-ins to the health industry they already they already know
[42:26.840 --> 42:32.000]  who gets what when are they gonna start using this information what's gonna be
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.500]  the ramifications as you just said right right well and you can you can bet
[42:35.500 --> 42:38.960]  it's gonna be some nefarious use I mean since when did the government ever
[42:38.960 --> 42:44.800]  collect data on people and use it to to do good
[42:44.800 --> 42:51.960]  well you know that's that's a day well the thing is like this last year what
[42:51.960 --> 42:56.080]  happened with the nurses they got fired for not taking their vaccines right right
[42:56.080 --> 43:00.680]  so what to say that they're not going to give this type of data there you know
[43:00.680 --> 43:05.840]  that the government can put a little bit of pressure on you know through some
[43:05.840 --> 43:10.400]  laws or whatever have you they're very expert at doing this but then put some
[43:10.400 --> 43:13.320]  pressure on some corporation to say you know what if you're not going to have
[43:13.320 --> 43:17.960]  your your people vaccinated then then you're gonna lose these types of
[43:17.960 --> 43:22.600]  benefits now in the problem is that the government actually purchases a large
[43:22.600 --> 43:26.680]  volume of vaccines so they are heavily financially interested in making sure
[43:26.680 --> 43:31.920]  that we keep continue to consume vaccines or so but well let me interject
[43:31.920 --> 43:37.840]  here though that my concern is that the very definition of vaccine is is being
[43:37.840 --> 43:44.080]  morphed where they're talking about behavioral vaccines where they inject
[43:44.080 --> 43:50.920]  you with maybe a nanotech or or a an organ region specific chemical that
[43:50.920 --> 43:55.280]  essentially lobotomizes a section of your brain they could call it a vaccine
[43:55.280 --> 43:59.160]  against radicalism for example there you know their definition of radicalism
[43:59.160 --> 44:03.680]  they can say oh you haven't had your vaccine against radicalism therefore you
[44:03.680 --> 44:07.800]  might be a radicalized danger to society you got to take this vaccine which is
[44:07.800 --> 44:11.200]  really a lobotomy that takes away your free will takes away critical thinking
[44:11.200 --> 44:15.800]  and so on I mean couldn't it proceed to that point or maybe perhaps we're already
[44:15.800 --> 44:20.480]  there well I think you know I think I think we have to take a look at this at
[44:20.480 --> 44:24.400]  a broader scope even even then vaccines because if they can do this for
[44:24.400 --> 44:29.440]  vaccines what's what's to say oh we're gonna mandate this type of medication
[44:29.440 --> 44:32.160]  for you and if you don't take it well we know who you are and we know where you
[44:32.160 --> 44:36.960]  live that's right and so we have you know it this might be a concern for it
[44:36.960 --> 44:41.240]  for certain demographics because you know we're concerned about vaccines but
[44:41.240 --> 44:45.320]  what we really have to be taking a look at is a broader scope is what does this
[44:45.320 --> 44:51.360]  have the ability to do and it gives the ability of the the high priest of
[44:51.360 --> 44:58.520]  pharmacology to put out their agenda and a track who is who is complying who is
[44:58.520 --> 45:01.760]  not that's right and give them what you know I mean you can take a look what's
[45:01.760 --> 45:06.000]  happening in schools you know if children aren't getting a riddle in or
[45:06.000 --> 45:09.040]  whatever I mean they've had in the past that some children have been taken away
[45:09.040 --> 45:13.960]  from CPS some parents have gotten a lot of trouble so I think you know George
[45:13.960 --> 45:17.640]  Washington summed it up best is saying you know government is not reason it's
[45:17.640 --> 45:22.160]  not eloquent it's force and like fire is dangerous if it's a dangerous servant
[45:22.160 --> 45:26.800]  and a fearful master I think we have to be very careful of who is influence our
[45:26.800 --> 45:31.000]  government absolutely we also know that doctors will conspire well especially
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.680]  pediatricians they will conspire with CPS to take away your children I've even
[45:35.680 --> 45:39.400]  said that you should not take your children to a conventional pediatrician
[45:39.400 --> 45:43.120]  ever because you're you should go to a naturopath instead because a
[45:43.120 --> 45:48.160]  conventional pediatrician if you don't follow their mandates of what they want
[45:48.160 --> 45:52.320]  you to do to your child they can just call the sheriff or call the police
[45:52.320 --> 45:55.960]  department and literally have your children kidnapped right there at gunpoint
[45:55.960 --> 45:58.760]  and they do this happens over and over again
[45:58.760 --> 46:05.760]  you know of course you know and I think I think the big thing to keep in mind there is is parents all parents are at
[46:05.760 --> 46:10.400]  different stages of their their their awakening if you will Mike and I think
[46:10.400 --> 46:13.520]  that's why you know we we we are so passionate about what we do is because
[46:13.520 --> 46:17.160]  we're trying to reach those people that that maybe not are already awake I mean
[46:17.160 --> 46:19.880]  those are the people that are joining our ranks and that are helping out it's
[46:19.880 --> 46:23.600]  those parents that are you know maybe this maybe it's their first child or
[46:23.600 --> 46:27.440]  maybe you know and the thing is that they're feared into doing this they're
[46:27.440 --> 46:32.000]  feared into going to pediatrician they're feared into vaccinating because you know
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.480]  a lot of parents that I talked to their gut instinct is like well you know I
[46:35.480 --> 46:38.680]  never really felt like these vaccines were the right thing to do and then I
[46:38.680 --> 46:42.240]  did more research but then it was too late and then my child was injured and
[46:42.240 --> 46:45.720]  you find a lot of parents with their first child being injured such as myself
[46:45.720 --> 46:51.440]  or even I have like I have about five or five or six autistic children just my
[46:51.440 --> 46:56.000]  block alone is pretty crazy but you're right young parents especially they are
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.560]  naive they don't understand they they think well oh the system would never do
[46:59.560 --> 47:03.160]  something that would put my child's health at risk no right right but that's
[47:03.160 --> 47:07.680]  wrong of the system always puts your child at risk by injecting your child
[47:07.680 --> 47:13.520]  with I mean let's face it you know mercury thymirosol formaldehyde msg
[47:13.520 --> 47:17.400]  and aluminum these are all things that are admitted to be put into various
[47:17.400 --> 47:21.400]  vaccines it's admitted by the CDC that this is not a conspiracy theory this is
[47:21.400 --> 47:24.960]  listed by the CDC on their own website that that's in vaccines yeah not to
[47:24.960 --> 47:28.840]  mention viruses cultured off of monkey kidneys
[47:28.840 --> 47:35.600]  calf blood sheep skin monkey testicles mouse brain you know I mean you can't
[47:35.600 --> 47:38.600]  really make this stuff up what do you have against monkey testicles come on
[47:38.600 --> 47:41.880]  man I mean everybody's gonna want to shoot those up come on I was causing
[47:41.880 --> 47:46.640]  cancer a lot of people back in the 1950s and 60s that was in the polio
[47:46.640 --> 47:52.800]  vaccine so I can't believe that you're against animal parts being injected
[47:52.800 --> 47:57.480]  let's let's tell us about your website by the way backtruth.com most of our
[47:57.480 --> 47:59.920]  listeners have heard of your website but just give us a quick overview of what
[47:59.920 --> 48:04.320]  people can find there yeah sure backtruth.com was started by myself in
[48:04.320 --> 48:10.240]  2009 my oldest son was injured by vaccines after 21 vaccine doses he
[48:10.240 --> 48:14.880]  stopped reaching his developmental milestones and you know like we went
[48:14.880 --> 48:20.160]  to what I consider the the medical marrow ground we went to psychologist
[48:20.160 --> 48:24.960]  neurologist speech therapist occupational therapist you name it and
[48:24.960 --> 48:30.560]  they all came back with the same answer is that your child appears to be normal
[48:30.560 --> 48:36.080]  and from what we can tell however we we don't know what's wrong with him you
[48:36.080 --> 48:39.480]  know and you're just gonna have to live with this throughout your life so that
[48:39.480 --> 48:44.520]  started my journey and you know lo and behold you know we looked into vaccines
[48:44.520 --> 48:50.400]  and looked into autism and we found our answers and so what backtruth is is an
[48:50.400 --> 48:54.600]  attempt to reach parents and to kind of tell them the other side of the story
[48:54.600 --> 48:58.320]  that there's more out to the the story than just what your pediatrician tells
[48:58.320 --> 49:01.760]  you yeah and you should research vaccines you should research what's in
[49:01.760 --> 49:07.360]  vaccines and research what type of reactions can can happen dear little
[49:07.360 --> 49:13.600]  baby you know that you can look at for example the MMR vaccine insert and that
[49:13.600 --> 49:20.080]  has over 65 adverse reactions in it and and then what our main goal is is into
[49:20.080 --> 49:25.960]  power parents because then the bullying doesn't work right triggers that doctors
[49:25.960 --> 49:32.360]  use it don't work the psychological methods and manipulation that you know
[49:32.360 --> 49:35.960]  the media learned from Edward Bernays do not work on parents because then they
[49:35.960 --> 49:39.840]  can see past all the garbage well being informed is the ultimate defense and
[49:39.840 --> 49:44.680]  doctors use the same techniques on cancer patients and I I mean just I had a
[49:44.680 --> 49:51.360]  recent situation of someone sort of a distant relative in the family who the
[49:51.360 --> 49:56.440]  hospital said he had a really high PSA number which is a completely bogus test
[49:56.440 --> 50:01.200]  they still use for prostate cancer they didn't even do any biopsy no MRIs nothing
[50:01.200 --> 50:03.680]  they just looked at this number and this they started dosing him up with
[50:03.680 --> 50:07.160]  chemotherapy they almost killed the man I mean they almost killed him everything
[50:07.160 --> 50:11.600]  was shutting down kidneys colon liver it was all shutting down we rescued him
[50:11.600 --> 50:16.520]  out of the hospital saved his life he's back to normal walking healthy again you
[50:16.520 --> 50:19.920]  know he can he can his biological functions are working in but the
[50:19.920 --> 50:23.880]  hospital was trying to kill him and they use the same tactics they intimidate
[50:23.880 --> 50:27.560]  people got him out of the hospital I took some doing believe me believe me I
[50:27.560 --> 50:32.360]  mean they the hospitals today they are murder centers they are literally trying
[50:32.360 --> 50:36.040]  to kill you but we're out of time Jeffrey I want to thank you for coming on the

[54:19.960 --> 54:24.880]  the alleged bomber was hiding out in the boat unarmed yeah the police so they
[54:24.880 --> 54:29.080]  locked down the whole city well not the whole city but this this whole section of
[54:29.080 --> 54:34.000]  the city about 400,000 people are so locked down shelter in place what does
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.720]  that mean like pull out your tent set up a tent in your living room I'm
[54:37.720 --> 54:44.040]  sheltering in place yes I'm doing as as I'm obedient I'm doing as I'm told but
[54:44.040 --> 54:49.320]  anyway Boston manhunt miss the boat the police skipped the street that this guy
[54:49.320 --> 54:55.120]  was on all right so so the wrong the rolling up and down all the other streets
[54:55.120 --> 55:02.560]  terrorizing terrorizing all the citizens who are trying to be as compliant as
[55:02.560 --> 55:07.680]  possible because they're completely spineless not not one person said no
[55:07.680 --> 55:10.920]  you can't come in my house you don't have a warrant get out of here you
[55:10.920 --> 55:16.720]  criminals not one person said that wait till they try that in Texas they're
[55:16.720 --> 55:21.800]  gonna get they're gonna get met with a lot of constitutional lawyers who
[55:21.800 --> 55:25.720]  challenge them but no they missed the boat but they're pulling everybody out
[55:25.720 --> 55:30.000]  of their homes people who are completely innocent they have no warrants they have
[55:30.000 --> 55:35.960]  no reasonable probable cause whatsoever to pull anybody out of their homes so the
[55:35.960 --> 55:41.640]  police are terrorizing Boston and they're skipping the street where the so-called
[55:41.640 --> 55:49.080]  terrorist is actually located yeah how pathetic does it get and we're showing
[55:49.080 --> 55:52.520]  you video for those of you watching online well we're just showing you some
[55:52.520 --> 55:56.680]  video of how they're they're pulling people out of their homes at gunpoint
[55:56.680 --> 56:01.400]  put your hands up put your hands up yeah you're you're living in Boston now this
[56:01.400 --> 56:06.200]  was a police state you're a criminal show me your papers no keep your hands up

[56:14.880 --> 56:20.840]  rifle at a citizen with a camera because you know cameras are evil so anyway
[56:20.840 --> 56:27.000]  they they skip the street did they skip it on purpose I don't know maybe not they
[56:27.000 --> 56:31.080]  skip the street and then when they finally come back and find the guy they
[56:31.080 --> 56:36.800]  have a quote shootout with an unarmed man they say they exchanged gunfire with a
[56:36.800 --> 56:44.440]  guy who didn't even have a gun I I just it's it's beyond it's okay it's beyond
[56:44.440 --> 56:50.880]  comedy at this point it's the theater is so pathetic it's all theater that's all
[56:50.880 --> 56:56.600]  it is the government has ceased to become a body that governs and it has
[56:56.600 --> 57:01.240]  become a body that actually has sort of like Shakespeare in the park
[57:01.240 --> 57:04.880]  Shakespeare at the marathon but it's not Shakespeare it's some other tragedy and
[57:04.880 --> 57:10.240]  it's all theater got the fake Hollywood blood it's got the professional actors
[57:10.240 --> 57:14.320]  that they use that they openly admitted to play the roles of victims and then
[57:14.320 --> 57:19.640]  it's got the police role-playing as if they're police who are actually following
[57:19.640 --> 57:23.360]  some kind of law but really there's a roll up and down that what they're
[57:23.360 --> 57:28.400]  really doing is acting like they're you know the Stasi or secret police from the
[57:28.400 --> 57:34.200]  old Soviet Union or something it's all role-playing folks it's all role-playing
[57:34.200 --> 57:37.360]  including the victims including the people in the homes the people in Boston
[57:37.360 --> 57:41.600]  who were sheltering in place who were huddling in their homes so afraid we
[57:41.600 --> 57:47.880]  don't have any guns to defend ourselves because we're in favor of gun control so
[57:47.880 --> 57:52.080]  we need the police to protect us oh look one of the police are coming to
[57:52.080 --> 57:57.600]  protect us knock knock knock come out with your hands up oh they're not
[57:57.600 --> 58:02.760]  protecting us they're arresting us what went wrong well what went wrong you

[1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:28.400]  Alex Jones all right we are already into the second hour thank you for
[1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:32.200]  continuing to join us this is the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams the
[1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:38.040]  health ranger filling in for Alex today and I was just ranting about how
[1:00:38.040 --> 1:00:43.200]  pathetic people are in in that Boston area where they just shelter in their
[1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:46.800]  homes and nobody even says did the police have the right to come in and
[1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:50.360]  just yank us all out of our homes without warrants just because there's a
[1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:56.240]  there's a teenager on the loose really really I mean if if if it was a police
[1:00:56.240 --> 1:01:01.560]  state locked down every time a teenager was on the loose yeah we would all be
[1:01:01.560 --> 1:01:05.160]  living in in in little tents in our living rooms we'd all be sheltering in
[1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:08.920]  place permanently because there's always a teenager on the loose right that's
[1:01:08.920 --> 1:01:15.200]  just that's part of being a teenager so I mean an unarmed one at that hiding in
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:24.120]  a boat now terrible so let's talk about banning pressure cookers because
[1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:29.880]  because everything that's related to a crime is instantly demonized by the
[1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:36.280]  mainstream media I mean I guess I guess if a bald guy shot some some kid in a
[1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:44.120]  grade school then they would ban hair because a bald guy did it ever no no
[1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:47.480]  they would have to mandate here I'm sorry we got to get the logic straight
[1:01:47.480 --> 1:01:54.600]  here no more bald guys you got to get hair in order to be a non-criminal so
[1:01:54.600 --> 1:02:00.080]  hair plugs for everybody to stop crime and then we'll put a sign in front of
[1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:04.800]  the school that says this is a bald free zone in addition to the gun free zone
[1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:12.120]  that's it I've got it figured out Eureka folks this is the solution you whatever
[1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:16.720]  how you observe whatever happens in the crime yeah well you get all the traits
[1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:19.680]  no matter what object they have no matter what they look like what they're
[1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:25.240]  wearing he's wearing blue jeans so blue jeans must be bad that's it's that's the
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:29.360]  answer right there it's all about correlation and connection now oh look
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:35.400]  what we have here folks oh my goodness thanks for bringing that in we have a
[1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:40.720]  pressure cooker in a black backpack obviously a terrible weapon mass
[1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:47.280]  destruction right here in the studio oh my goodness let's open it up oh no it's
[1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:53.360]  a pressure cooker what an evil object I'm sure that it's been used more in
[1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:58.560]  bombings than it has been in cooking chicken obviously it's an evil evil
[1:02:58.560 --> 1:03:04.840]  device so evil who makes this pressure cooker who where is it made let's see
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:10.640]  oh there's even something in it what you guys put in here presto the presto
[1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:17.000]  pressure cooker a terrible item let's go to this video where an activist is
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:20.680]  trying to get college students to ban pressure cookers because they're so evil
[1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:26.640]  let's go to that hi friends liberal trick here and I'm here on the fi u
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:32.720]  campus to have students sign a position to ban pressure cookers because I
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:39.560]  really feel that they are what caused the Boston bombings so we need to ban
[1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:46.000]  them we need to control who has them so we can have a safer society I can ask

[1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:28.760]  Alex Jones all right welcome back this is the Alex Jones show yep Mike Adams
[1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:32.640]  the Outranger filling in for Alex today thank you for continuing with us we've
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:35.880]  been talking about pressure cookers and we just showed a video in the last
[1:08:35.880 --> 1:08:42.200]  segment about so-called activist chick that's sort of her screen name going on
[1:08:42.200 --> 1:08:45.720]  the college campuses and having college students sign petitions to ban pressure
[1:08:45.720 --> 1:08:49.120]  cookers because you know pressure cookers are such evil devices I've got
[1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:52.280]  one in the studio right here in front of me an actual pressure cooker yes
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:57.040]  contraband here in the infowars studio somebody called the Austin police we've
[1:08:57.040 --> 1:09:04.080]  got a pressure cooker right here in the studio and it's filled with sugar that
[1:09:04.080 --> 1:09:08.520]  probably is dangerous right there I got a couple of ideas on the pressure cooker
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:13.560]  here let me put that lid on stop that terrible sound okay couple of ideas
[1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:17.520]  number one what we should really have and this is this is me speaking from the
[1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:21.720]  heart is we should have nationwide pressure cooker universal background
[1:09:21.720 --> 1:09:26.560]  checks before you purchase a pressure cooker you got to give your ID you got
[1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:31.560]  to fill out a form and I think we should put the ATF in charge of vetting
[1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:37.480]  pressure cooker purchases because after all the ATF is alcohol tobacco firearms
[1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:42.840]  and explosives don't forget the explosives part it's actually the Bureau of
[1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:48.320]  alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives don't forget the E this is the E right
[1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:53.520]  here so pressure cookers should now be controlled by the ATF and all the stores
[1:09:53.520 --> 1:09:57.680]  that sell pressure cookers like Walmart one of the target I don't know all these
[1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:02.760]  stores they should now apply for federal firearms licenses yeah they got to be
[1:10:02.760 --> 1:10:07.280]  like class 3 retailers and then they could then they could sell pressure
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:13.680]  cookers and suppressors and like rocket launchers together and right there
[1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:17.480]  that's just that's just what we need obviously this is all satire but
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:21.120]  universal background checks for pressure cookers a great idea another great
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:25.840]  idea is the what I'm calling the Bill Gates variety of the pressure cooker
[1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:30.600]  where what you do is you surround instead of filling the pressure cooker with
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:35.080]  nails and scrap metal and ball bearings what you do is you fill it with
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:39.360]  vaccines and that way you set it in a crowd like Bill Gates or one of his
[1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:43.320]  minions would set it in a crowd and when it explodes it vaccinate everybody
[1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:48.520]  just instantly vaccinate everybody mission accomplished for the government
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:53.000]  they love it and then they can claim you know it was a terrorist attack but
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:58.360]  thank God people won't get the flu thank God that we put vaccines in that bomb
[1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:04.560]  that pressure cooker so those are those are my two ideas am I getting too cynical
[1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:10.720]  in my non-old age oh it's gonna be terrible by the time I'm 80 guys this
[1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:19.800]  is gonna be totally out of control I'm just okay truth truthfully truthfully
[1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:27.040]  yeah thanks guys they said to lock me away before I reach 80 yeah look I'm
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:30.080]  not doing this for very much longer believe me because we're gonna we're
[1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:35.200]  we're winning at so many levels man I can't wait I can't wait for the the mass
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:40.840]  awakening the the next society based on liberty which I believe is coming I
[1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:47.400]  think we're gonna win at every level and in the future you know what pressure
[1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:52.360]  cookers should remain legal so people can cook their beans and rice but hey I
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:55.720]  guess if you're on the USDA's food stamps and you're an illegal alien getting
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:11:58.720]  free food stamp money you don't need a pressure cooker because you can just go
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:01.720]  to the grocery store and you can buy lobster already cooked and you know
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:06.000]  ready to eat because lobster you can buy lobster on the food stamp program
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:11.040]  all right now in just a few minutes and yes by the way half of what I say here
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:16.120]  on the show is like cynical satire probably pathetic attempts at comedy I
[1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:22.880]  admit it it's just but what else can you do man it's so insane it's so insane
[1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:28.560]  like a banning pressure cookers and fake blood on the scene and actors
[1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:32.880]  everywhere it's so it's so insane what can you do but but you know I guess if
[1:12:32.880 --> 1:12:36.680]  you have you know two brain cells that are functioning your conspiracy theories
[1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:40.400]  now because you can think for yourself so there you go but coming up here in
[1:12:40.400 --> 1:12:45.120]  just a few minutes we've got Wayne Allen root author of the ultimate Obama
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:49.360]  survival guide how to survive thrive and prosper during Obama get in and he
[1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:53.480]  does not endorse my last segment on the pressure cooker by the way is his his
[1:12:53.480 --> 1:12:56.480]  appearance on the show is not an endorsement of everything I just said
[1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:01.280]  which is extremely politically incorrect and that's and that's that's why I
[1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:05.240]  said it because this is free speech being exercised right here and I I
[1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:11.000]  actually think that the info wars audience is intelligent enough to see the
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:15.400]  humor even in a little bit of tragedy you know to see the contradictions to see
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:19.600]  the hypocrisy when we point them out so I have faith in you the listeners to know
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:24.920]  the difference between satire and actual factual reporting we do both we do both
[1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:28.120]  because we want it we want you to be informed but we also want you to have a
[1:13:28.120 --> 1:13:33.480]  good day even though the police state is collapsing all around us or expanding
[1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:37.400]  all around us I should say Liberty is is collapsing and temporarily we want you
[1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:41.040]  to have a good time while you're fighting for Liberty okay that's the
[1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:45.200]  bottom line now speaking to people who fight for Liberty we've got Wayne Allen
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:48.640]  root again author of the Obama survival guide the ultimate Obama survival
[1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:52.760]  survival guide I should say which is available on Amazon.com and you know
[1:13:52.760 --> 1:13:57.960]  bookstores everywhere and I've never interviewed Wayne before but he joins us
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:02.080]  now on the Alex Jones show thank you for joining us. Hey Mike how are you? I'm
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:05.680]  having a good time here just doing my part for Liberty how about you? I'm so
[1:14:05.680 --> 1:14:09.000]  thrilled and honored that you have me on I'm thrilled that you found me and I'm
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:12.680]  really thrilled is the first time I've ever been on Alex Jones I think I've
[1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:17.600]  done every conservative and libertarian talk show on the entire planet except
[1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:20.920]  Alex Jones and I was waiting and wondering when Alex is ever gonna
[1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:25.120]  call so I'm glad you called. Well it's funny I I just happened to cross your
[1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:29.160]  book I was literally shopping on Amazon which I do a lot you know and getting
[1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:32.680]  books and things and and your book popped up and the title was fantastic I
[1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:36.520]  did a little research on you I found your website I liked what you were
[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:41.640]  proposing for example you proposed a a one-year income tax holiday where none
[1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:45.760]  of us would pay any federal income taxes tell us about that. I did by the way
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:49.160]  that's one of the things that got cut out of the book you know what I did with
[1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:54.040]  this book is they gave me an impossible deal they said Wayne you've got 60 days
[1:14:54.040 --> 1:14:58.840]  to write the book the ultimate Obama survival guide can you do it. Crazy. And I
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:03.280]  said are you crazy 60 days and they said we have faith in you you'll do it and I
[1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:06.680]  did it I brought it in one week early they wanted 50,000 words I delivered a
[1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:11.520]  hundred thousand one week early and what we decided was you can't you know the
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:16.400]  book already is 450 pages of solutions for America instead of the usual
[1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:21.720]  criticism of Obama and nothing but it's solutions but they decided that you know
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:26.480]  we'll save the solutions for America for another day at another time let's just
[1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:30.520]  write the solutions for the individual so they cut that out but I think if you
[1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:35.400]  wanted to turn around this economy you want to turn a horrible what I call
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:41.720]  Obama Great Depression into a boom economy you would do Reagan on steroids
[1:15:41.720 --> 1:15:45.560]  Ronald Reagan turned around Jimmy Carter's horrible economy the worst since
[1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:49.520]  the Great Depression in just two years by just cutting taxes from the 70%
[1:15:49.520 --> 1:15:54.320]  rate to the 20% rate and overnight for a lot by rewarding the people that do all
[1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:58.440]  the work and invest all the money and risk all the money and work 16 hours a
[1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:01.840]  day the entrepreneurs and the business owners overnight the whole economy
[1:16:01.840 --> 1:16:05.040]  turned around and you could do the same thing now but I would do it Reagan on
[1:16:05.040 --> 1:16:09.960]  steroids I would give everyone a one-year income tax vacation for one year we
[1:16:09.960 --> 1:16:13.840]  all get to keep our own money well I love the idea and it's actually feasible
[1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:18.200]  because if you look at the banker bailouts that took place right the
[1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:22.520]  government instantly created over a trillion dollars when they wanted to and
[1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:27.840]  they gave it to the banksters they they could just create another trillion
[1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:31.760]  dollars let's see that the personal income tax paid to the federal government
[1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:35.600]  each year is about two trillion one point two trillion one point two okay
[1:16:35.600 --> 1:16:38.400]  so they could create that instantly and just saying you don't have to pay any
[1:16:38.400 --> 1:16:41.240]  taxes this year they can do it let me go step further not only are you right
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:43.960]  instead of giving it to the bankers should they've given it to the people the
[1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:48.200]  citizens and the small business owners the entrepreneurs but on top of that the
[1:16:48.200 --> 1:16:52.160]  stimulus that Obama created was about a trillion dollars it was you know 800
[1:16:52.160 --> 1:16:57.160]  billion give or take a 50 billion or so maybe the 800 850 billion so that's
[1:16:57.160 --> 1:17:01.240]  almost one point two trillion so if you had enough money to give a stimulus out
[1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:05.240]  to the biggest Democratic contributors in the world and the people who supported
[1:17:05.240 --> 1:17:08.880]  Obama to just hand money to the unions and the Democratic contributors and the
[1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:12.720]  people started green energy companies yeah crony capitalism and the Obama
[1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:17.040]  supporters you certainly would have had a trillion to give to the actual people
[1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:21.320]  that create the jobs which are the taxpayer get to keep our own money
[1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:26.040]  instead of instead of handing it out to others so it's a tragedy that no one
[1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:29.640]  thinks this way or not enough people think this way and I just got back I
[1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:33.440]  rushed back to the interview with you I gave a keynote speech at a major event
[1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:37.600]  in Las Vegas at the mirage hotel and I was telling them a similar story I was
[1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:42.960]  saying you guys don't get it this is a world-wide conspiracy Obama's part of
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:46.760]  it but almost every country in the world is doing the same thing to create two
[1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:51.480]  classes of people the super rich who are dependent on government for bribes to
[1:17:51.480 --> 1:17:56.160]  stay super rich and to get even richer bribes like stimulus and bailout and
[1:17:56.160 --> 1:18:00.360]  and and all the other things from green energy to government contracts and then
[1:18:00.360 --> 1:18:03.800]  and of course the pump 85 billion a month into the stock market to make sure
[1:18:03.800 --> 1:18:11.880]  the richest CEOs in America yeah they all support Obama in return for him
[1:18:11.880 --> 1:18:15.440]  creating a two-class society the super rich and the rest of us who are all poor
[1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:20.560]  or are going to soon be poor dependent on government so both classes
[1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:25.520]  desperately are dependent on the guy in charge and this creates bigger
[1:18:25.520 --> 1:18:29.160]  government and more powerful government and central banks all over the world
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:33.280]  that's what's maddening about this the entire Obama philosophy which is
[1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:38.480]  actually bigger than Obama himself obviously but the philosophy is the
[1:18:38.480 --> 1:18:44.480]  destruction of innovation and entrepreneurship and and small business
[1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:49.120]  the destruction of any self-reliance or independence it's all about putting
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:54.240]  everybody in a victim role so they're dependent on the government and it's it
[1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:58.560]  is destroying the US economy well let me tell you story a funny story from my
[1:18:58.560 --> 1:19:03.560]  book I mean like I said my book is mostly solutions and I hope we get to him
[1:19:03.560 --> 1:19:06.320]  but I still got to tell you this story I don't know what is interrupting I got to
[1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:10.080]  tell you this I'm the only guy who could put Obama at the scene of the crime in
[1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:13.000]  this whole country because I was a college classmate did you know that no
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:17.360]  didn't know that class of 83 Columbia University he says he graduated class of
[1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:21.520]  83 same day as me says he was political science same as me says he was
[1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:26.160]  pre-law same as me if that's true I never met him but if that's true and that's
[1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:29.720]  strange too but let's not get into that I never saw him never heard of him never
[1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:33.360]  met him in my entire life don't know anyone who did but assuming he went
[1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:36.360]  there and he probably just never went to class probably too busy attending
[1:19:36.360 --> 1:19:40.520]  Communist Party meetings but assuming he went to class he was there and we're

[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:13.760]  me read you a quote from Wayne's website that I found and I like I like this
[1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:18.600]  quote it's it's perfect it's also very uncensored this is why I like talking to
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:23.440]  Wayne he says quote Obama is purposely overwhelming the US economy to create
[1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:28.320]  systemic failure economic crisis and social chaos thereby destroying
[1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:33.080]  capitalism and our country from within but the bonus is brilliant as he
[1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:36.880]  destroys and taxes to death business owners he also cripples his political
[1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:42.000]  opposition strong words but accurate Wayne yeah you know what's funny I just
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.920]  wanted to mention real quick I sat here you know during the break listening to
[1:25:44.920 --> 1:25:51.200]  your ads and your ads are my book you the Alice Jones show is my book you know
[1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:54.760]  my book is about the lots of great financial advice made to the richest
[1:25:54.760 --> 1:25:58.600]  guys in the country and from me a common sense small businessman how you
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:01.840]  prosper and all the terrible moves Obama's gonna make and they're not a
[1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:05.320]  mistake he's not inexperienced they're purposeful and then my book is about
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:09.280]  homeschooling because we homeschool our four children and my oldest is attending
[1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:13.240]  Harvard and now Oxford straight-A student at both even though she was never
[1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:16.520]  in a single government classroom for you which proves you don't need the
[1:26:16.520 --> 1:26:20.440]  government to educate your kids and then I interviewed a US special forces
[1:26:20.440 --> 1:26:24.720]  commando about survival techniques what you do if everything goes to hell how
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:28.040]  to turn your home into a fortress and protect your family what guns you need
[1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:31.360]  what bullets you need how much water how much food and I'm listening to these ads
[1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:35.280]  I take Lorella I take probiotics I take a hundred vitamin pills a day it's the
[1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:40.080]  reason I have the energy of a hundred men this is me so I'm so proud to be on
[1:26:40.080 --> 1:26:44.560]  your show I think I found a home
[1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:48.880]  but I think you'll really be fascinating but yeah so I go to Columbia University
[1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:52.680]  and Obama claims he graduated on the same day and so he must have gone to the
[1:26:52.680 --> 1:26:55.920]  same classes even though I never saw him he must have known the same people he
[1:26:55.920 --> 1:26:59.040]  must have hung out in the same restaurants nearby and we must have talked
[1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:02.320]  about the same thing do you know what they talked about a Columbia 24 hours a
[1:27:02.320 --> 1:27:07.720]  day for four years no destroying capitalist down the American I was the
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:12.720]  Reagan conservative at Columbia and I had to sit and listen to nothing but
[1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:17.920]  communists and Marxist radicals all day long telling me how racist America was
[1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:22.800]  and how terrible America was and how it was a system that breathed in inequality
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:27.920]  was no fairness and the system had to be taken down completely and destroyed and
[1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:31.840]  how did they plan to do it all day long for four years this is what I heard
[1:27:31.840 --> 1:27:37.240]  ad nauseam how did these radicals who all outwardly proudly publicly said wait
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:42.640]  I'm a communist they said this all my fellow students not most of them 99% of
[1:27:42.640 --> 1:27:46.320]  them said they hated the system and resented the system and wanted to destroy
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:50.120]  capitalism and bankrupt all the rich people and they said they do it with a
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:56.240]  system called cloward and tiffin to Columbia professors who were married who
[1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:01.240]  had a system you had to destroy America from within and you could only do it by
[1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:05.840]  electing a guy who's a handsome guy who looks good and wears nice suits who
[1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:10.320]  cuts his hair his afro to look like a lawyer he looks like Mr. Prosecutor
[1:28:10.320 --> 1:28:15.080]  Mr. Lawyer somebody to respect the businessman he shakes hands he kisses
[1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:20.080]  babies he hugs women he smiles with pearly white teeth he tells people that
[1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:24.280]  he's a knight or not a divider he tells people he's a moderate not a radical
[1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:30.160]  well and he's a convincing linguistic speaker with lots of manipulations in
[1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:34.080]  his speech moderate well he read reality's a communist remarks and then he
[1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:39.480]  destroys the system from within with this specific Mike this specific agenda
[1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:45.320]  he overwhelms the system with government spending jet and entitlement
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:50.920]  meaning food stamps disability a welfare aid to dependent children free meals at
[1:28:50.920 --> 1:28:55.760]  school unemployment extended forever let me ask you some folks does this sound
[1:28:55.760 --> 1:28:59.800]  like what's happening right now yeah that's it that's the playbook right there
[1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:04.200]  that's it this isn't a mistake this was a purposeful plan defies that Columbia
[1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:08.200]  University in front of me and my classmate got elected and he is carrying
[1:29:08.200 --> 1:29:13.080]  it out don't think Obama's dumb I think he's brilliant well he's he's a
[1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:16.920]  brilliant manipulator absolutely now we got to go to another break here but
[1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:19.640]  when we come back from the break I'd like you to get into some of the
[1:29:19.640 --> 1:29:24.360]  solutions specifically how do we protect ourselves from the train wreck of
[1:29:24.360 --> 1:29:28.200]  Obamacare and all the new taxes that are going to be kicking in over the next
[1:29:28.200 --> 1:29:33.360]  three years to punish us for not buying the overpriced private insurance that
[1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:37.960]  the government wants us to buy and how we protect ourselves from the economy
[1:29:37.960 --> 1:29:41.600]  being gutted by Obama and also how do we protect our liberties so those are some
[1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:45.200]  of the questions I have for you Wayne Allen route continues with us after this

[1:30:00.960 --> 1:30:05.680]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[1:30:05.680 --> 1:30:09.240]  good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[1:30:09.240 --> 1:30:13.320]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:16.760]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[1:30:16.760 --> 1:30:21.520]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:23.320]  have a pressure cooker in your home because that could be a sign that
[1:34:23.320 --> 1:34:26.840]  you're evil yeah well certainly Obama thinks I'm evil because I have the
[1:34:26.840 --> 1:34:30.320]  ultimate Obama survival guide of my book by the way we don't have time for this
[1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:34.760]  today but I wrote a commentary at the blaze Glenn Bexite back in I don't know I
[1:34:34.760 --> 1:34:38.480]  guess was last August about the fact that literally no one in the country is a
[1:34:38.480 --> 1:34:42.120]  bigger mouth than me against Obama I've been everywhere in the media for four
[1:34:42.120 --> 1:34:45.600]  years ripping this guy to shreds and suddenly I had a major IRS attack
[1:34:45.600 --> 1:34:49.960]  really my life I mean literally they came after me with with a vengeance and I
[1:34:49.960 --> 1:34:52.880]  had to hire one of the best tax lawyers in America it's not the best tax lawyer
[1:34:52.880 --> 1:34:55.720]  and he said my god I've never seen anything like this you are on the
[1:34:55.720 --> 1:35:00.240]  president's enemies list so you're talking about a Chicago thug that comes
[1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:03.760]  after people with the government with the police state with the internal
[1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:08.440]  revenue service you're talking about massive audits massive taxes massive
[1:35:08.440 --> 1:35:11.720]  regulations did you know I went to the government's own website and the last
[1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:18.840]  90 days from January 1st to the end of the first quarter March 31st 6,118 new
[1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:23.800]  government regulation this guy must have sweatshops with lawyers working in
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:28.000]  shifts 24 hours a day to think up ways to destroy the American economy that's
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.480]  true thousand rules in 90 days are you kidding me that's how they wrote the
[1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:35.600]  healthcare bill they had to be like a sweatshop word processing right
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:40.800]  convention with the immigration bill to the thousand pages and you know there's
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:45.240]  lawyer legalese in it that none of us can even read no intended to destroy the
[1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:49.960]  country you know it the trick is to overwhelm the legislators with so much
[1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:53.800]  language that they can't possibly parse it and overwhelm guys like me I can't
[1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:57.240]  keep up with all the bad bills and bad policies and bad executive actions that
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:36:00.600]  Obama's putting in place that's right it is spinning like I'm on the exorcist
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:06.040]  okay yeah plan well let's get to some solutions though we promised listeners
[1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:08.520]  that and I know that's what your book is mostly about it's called the ultimate
[1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:15.560]  Obama survival guide and by the way I I ordered your book weeks number one
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:20.920]  finance book in Amazon and the number one conservative or liberal really well
[1:36:20.920 --> 1:36:24.360]  good job I don't know I had never heard of it until a couple of days ago so I
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:28.320]  just I just literally stumbled across it online I ordered the book I haven't
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:32.240]  received it yet so I haven't read it yet but in any case it sounds very
[1:36:32.240 --> 1:36:35.280]  intriguing tell us about some of the solutions that are in the book so I came
[1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:38.560]  up with an 18 point plan that I believe is a common sense small businessman could
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:41.960]  help you compete with Obama it's called white pod because I know everything needs
[1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:47.720]  a catchy name white pod it's your personal Obama differential I like it
[1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:51.160]  and I then I went out and interviewed 18 of the richest guys in America to make sure
[1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:54.200]  I was right and ask them what their game plan is and these guys are worth a
[1:36:54.200 --> 1:36:57.720]  hundred million or more a couple of billionaires three of managed billion
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:37:01.440]  dollar hedge funds and guess what they said they all basically agreed I wrote
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:05.640]  18 chapters with what they said in the book so you get my advice and then you
[1:37:05.640 --> 1:37:09.480]  get the advice of 18 really rich successful guys what they're doing it
[1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:13.920]  kind of match but is it also applicable applicable to regular income people who
[1:37:13.920 --> 1:37:17.600]  aren't well written for middle class people certainly 18 point plan is so
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:20.280]  so here's so much things that we all agreed on though I think it's important
[1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:24.440]  to hear what me Wayne Root you know a small businessman common sense guy said
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:28.440]  that agrees with what the 18 millionaires and billionaires highfalutin guy
[1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:32.520]  said who will dislike Obama by the way they're more often they are them but
[1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:36.520]  but having said that so number one they all agreed you got it by gold there
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:40.440]  wasn't one of the 18 who didn't believe that gold isn't the answer as the
[1:37:40.440 --> 1:37:44.680]  economy is destroyed as debt is massively increased as spending will only go up
[1:37:44.680 --> 1:37:47.960]  whether it's Republicans or Democrats it isn't gonna make a difference it's
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:52.240]  Obama the worst yeah you see the worst on steroids yes you see the biggest
[1:37:52.240 --> 1:37:56.320]  government nanny state socialist Marxist you'll ever find yes but guess what
[1:37:56.320 --> 1:37:59.400]  Romney wouldn't have been much better and George W. Bush wasn't much better
[1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:02.840]  and even my hero Ronald Reagan government increased dramatically under
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:07.440]  Reagan so you're never gonna stop it it just isn't gonna happen yeah so the debt
[1:38:07.440 --> 1:38:11.320]  will continue to go up and if you know the debt will go up in America and all
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:15.760]  over the world Japan is basically twice as in dead as America twice as bad as
[1:38:15.760 --> 1:38:19.720]  Greece Japan is dead if you know Europe is dead Europe's entering a great
[1:38:19.720 --> 1:38:23.040]  depression right now as we speak I believe America is as well but Europe's
[1:38:23.040 --> 1:38:26.320]  even worse well yeah they're just taking money out of private bank accounts
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:29.760]  across the private bank and the only way out of this according to big government
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:33.400]  liberals the only way out to me the way out Mike is you cut spending
[1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:37.080]  dramatically but they'll never do it of course and so the only way out is you
[1:38:37.080 --> 1:38:41.280]  if you inflate you inflate inflate inflate you print you print you print
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:45.640]  you spend that's right so therefore you want to own gold here's some numbers
[1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:48.400]  that will blow your mind though I'll bet your audience never heard these numbers
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:53.880]  they're from my book in 1913 if you had a million dollars today it's worth $40,000
[1:38:53.880 --> 1:38:58.000]  if you kept your money in the US dollar it's worth 40,000 cuz the effects of
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.960]  inflation right if you took the same million you put in gold you know it's
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:06.040]  worth today million seventy seven million if you took a million in the
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:11.080]  year 1971 today it's worth 200,000 if you took the same million put in gold over
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:16.480]  40 million today so when CNBC and all their experts tell you not to buy gold
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:20.880]  and Warren Buffett tells you not to buy gold gold is outperforms Warren Buffett's
[1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:27.120]  Berkshire half-way stock by 300% no they tell you not to buy gold because
[1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:31.440]  that's that's a political agenda on their part correct they want you in the US
[1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:35.080]  dollar watch in the stock market to make all these rich guys rich they get back
[1:39:35.080 --> 1:39:39.160]  Obama the all for the obvious reasons they want to fool you biggest Ponzi
[1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:42.800]  scheme in world history by the way the stock market oh of course of course
[1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:47.120]  really great so number two what do these guys say what do I say most of a no
[1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:51.880]  tax state see you can't avoid Obama's taxes I'm not a magic man Mike I can't
[1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:55.520]  wave a wand and say you won't have to pay the taxes but at least if you're
[1:39:55.520 --> 1:39:59.360]  living in Nevada where I live if you're living in Texas or Florida your state
[1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:04.160]  income tax is zero so as Obama increases taxes by say 20% which is
[1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:07.240]  overwhelming and you can't survive and you can't pay your mortgage and you
[1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:11.680]  can't take care of your kids properly you go to a state where you pay 20% less
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:14.880]  and it evens out you're not doing any better but at least not doing worse
[1:40:14.880 --> 1:40:18.800]  right so all of all of the 18 millionaires and billionaires have moved
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:22.720]  either Nevada, Texas or Florida which is random I called them I didn't know they
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:25.840]  lived in those states they all said I got out of Illinois I got out of New York I
[1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:30.120]  got out of California yeah there's a nightmare attack Maryland and move to
[1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:34.000]  Virginia much better just walking across a border so that's one way to help
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:38.280]  yourself they all said invest in farmland and agriculture stocks I've said the
[1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:41.640]  same thing yeah food producing land yep so when the price of food goes up and
[1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:45.160]  there's food shortages you'll cheer instead of get mad they did invest in
[1:40:45.160 --> 1:40:48.720]  believe it or not energy stocks because they said instead of walking up to the
[1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:52.600]  pump and filling up your gas tank and complaining next time you'll cheer when
[1:40:52.600 --> 1:40:55.680]  the price of gas goes up why are you complaining when all you have to do is
[1:40:55.680 --> 1:41:00.120]  own ExxonMobil and when the price goes up you make money well I wouldn't firstly I
[1:41:00.120 --> 1:41:03.600]  wouldn't own ExxonMobil but I hear what you're saying but what about defense
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:07.680]  against Obamacare what what can we do in that realm well you know the first of all
[1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:12.440]  I interviewed a doctor you know a real important MD who refused to put his name
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:15.920]  on it he did an anonymous chapter that told you all the ways to deal with
[1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:20.480]  Obamacare but I'd rather tell you the financial end that I recommend and the
[1:41:20.480 --> 1:41:24.520]  financial end is look you'll deal with Obamacare by doing what medical experts
[1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:28.200]  say I'm not one and don't claim to be one but I'm a financial guy I'm a smart
[1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:32.520]  common-sense guy and I think you should invest in medical real estate and
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:36.400]  medical stocks why because the government is the one now in charge of
[1:41:36.400 --> 1:41:40.200]  medical and the government when they spend doesn't couldn't care less what
[1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:42.960]  how much they're spending because there's no one watching over them and
[1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:47.400]  it's not their money so we all know they buy $10 wrenches the Pentagon for 500
[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:51.200]  bucks and they fix toilets with a little ring that cost 20 cents and they pay a
[1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:54.680]  hundred bucks for it they're now going to do that in the medical field so if I
[1:41:54.680 --> 1:41:58.160]  was you I would make sure I owned pharmaceutical companies on the stock
[1:41:58.160 --> 1:42:02.400]  exchange I would make sure I owned any form of a medical company that will
[1:42:02.400 --> 1:42:07.280]  benefit from 40 million people without health insurance being now forced into
[1:42:07.280 --> 1:42:10.520]  the system and the government's paying the bill I think health insurance
[1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:14.160]  companies might they're gonna get rich well but but but I hear you on the
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:18.400]  financial side but what about morally the the I'm gonna challenge a little bit
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:21.900]  on this point on the pharmaceutical companies because morally you know so
[1:42:21.900 --> 1:42:25.840]  many these companies are engaged in so many crimes corruption bribery kickbacks
[1:42:25.840 --> 1:42:30.840]  killing people medical experiments on children and so on I won't debate you
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:34.560]  all I'll say to you is I'm a capitalist and I believe in making money because
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:37.880]  with the money I could choose to do good I give a lot of money to charity I give
[1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:41.280]  about a hundred thousand a year to charity I take care of people I take
[1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:45.440]  care of my family and if all of you make money on my advice you'll do good
[1:42:45.440 --> 1:42:48.680]  things with your money protect your own families to me it's sticking your head
[1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:52.280]  in the sand to say morally I disagree with what pharmaceutical companies do
[1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:55.880]  because I'm with you I disagree on the health nut I eat organic food take a
[1:42:55.880 --> 1:42:59.880]  hundred vitamin pills a day and I hate what the FDA does on behalf of form of
[1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:03.520]  pharmaceutical companies to good vitamin manufacturers but having said that if I
[1:43:03.520 --> 1:43:07.440]  see a good opportunity I'm gonna try and make some money and help you protect
[1:43:07.440 --> 1:43:12.600]  your family well yeah I would say but by the way just let me just throw this
[1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:16.400]  in I would say there are some medical device companies that are that are a
[1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:21.560]  lot more ethical than the the big pharma companies are very unethical but
[1:43:21.560 --> 1:43:24.800]  there might be some let's say generic pharmaceutical companies that aren't
[1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:28.120]  engaged in all these crimes they're just doing sort of basic you know
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:32.240]  antibiotics that that are acceptable in limited use and things like I just got
[1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:35.320]  to say this because you know my nickname is the health ranger and I fought
[1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:38.320]  against the pharmaceutical companies for so long I wouldn't recommend putting
[1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:42.280]  any money into those companies my ultimate recommendation for the medical
[1:43:42.280 --> 1:43:45.240]  end of things for fighting Obamacare is you don't want to get in the system
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:48.480]  that's right yeah that's right so you want to take vitamins you want to be
[1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:52.560]  healthy you want to work out absolutely eat organic and so invest in whole food
[1:43:52.560 --> 1:43:58.240]  yes whole foods company invest in vitamin manufacturing yes your angle okay yeah I got
[1:43:58.240 --> 1:44:01.840]  it these are all common sense ways to take advantage I just never want to get
[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:05.040]  in the system I'm gonna be so healthy I don't want to ever get near a hospital or
[1:44:05.040 --> 1:44:08.480]  be involved in the system yeah cuz once you do then then you get sicker then you
[1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:11.920]  get C diff infections then you get superb bugs correct then you get side
[1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:15.640]  effects then it's worse all you have to do is eat healthy and take vitamins and
[1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:19.840]  you never get sick that's right in my life and I've been taking vitamins since
[1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:23.520]  I was 15 years old I've been a vitamin nut I was a bodybuilder and an athlete and
[1:44:23.520 --> 1:44:27.280]  I took good care of my body never smoked never drank never done a drug lots of
[1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:30.520]  vitamins and lots of working out and I've never really been sick other than
[1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:34.720]  sniffles in my whole life so you don't need the medical system if you take care
[1:44:34.720 --> 1:44:37.680]  of yourself but the government the pharmaceutical companies don't want you
[1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:41.200]  to know that but Mike doesn't mean I'm not willing to make a bet on a pharmaceutical
[1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:44.560]  company and make it extra ten thousand dollars and therefore take care of my
[1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:47.880]  family I think that's smart thinking well but the but the real issue here is
[1:44:47.880 --> 1:44:52.440]  that Obama is forcing us to buy into a system that we don't want to use
[1:44:52.440 --> 1:44:55.880]  understood it's all gonna come crashing down we all know that right
[1:44:55.880 --> 1:44:59.760]  cannot work but investing foreign stocks bonds in real estate may be the most
[1:44:59.760 --> 1:45:03.320]  important thing I could tell you today because not only did I write that as my
[1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:07.020]  singular most important thing besides gold and moving to a low-tech state that
[1:45:07.020 --> 1:45:10.240]  was number three but all the 18 millionaires and billionaires agreed
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:13.520]  don't invest in American biotech companies don't invest in American
[1:45:13.520 --> 1:45:18.080]  pharmaceutical invested ones that supply China India Hong Kong Singapore
[1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:23.920]  Thailand Vietnam Laos Cambodia Australia New Zealand Switzerland why because
[1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:27.560]  those are countries where people are still hungry and ambitious and they know
[1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:31.240]  you either work or you starve to death so those countries are going to kick our
[1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:35.280]  butt for the next ten years and grow much faster than us and you want to
[1:45:35.280 --> 1:45:39.440]  invest in ETFs exchange traded funds and mutual funds that invest in those
[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:44.480]  countries pharmaceutical and technology and electronic and hospitality
[1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:48.400]  companies not American one well what what about people who don't have money to
[1:45:48.400 --> 1:45:52.360]  invest I mean they're barely getting by the tax burden is so huge it's horrible
[1:45:52.360 --> 1:45:56.800]  so much money going out the door than you are so so if you have no money I
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:45:59.920]  can't wage a magic wand and make you money but I could tell you move to a
[1:45:59.920 --> 1:46:03.400]  place you keep more of your own money you don't work one day longer but you keep
[1:46:03.400 --> 1:46:06.600]  it extra 10 or 20 percent that makes sense I can have you invest in your
[1:46:06.600 --> 1:46:10.280]  children's education by explaining how I homeschooled my daughter to Harvard and
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:13.680]  Oxford she's now a three-day student and won the John Harvard Award and the
[1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:17.840]  highest honors in Oxford a month ago without ever being in a classroom in
[1:46:17.840 --> 1:46:21.120]  her life and I could show you that the ultimate Obama survival guide and then
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:26.520]  I can educate you as to do a US military special forces commando how to buy the
[1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:30.560]  best survival materials you can for your house to turn your home into a
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:34.480]  fortress and to take care of your family all of that without me being the expert
[1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:39.080]  I found the right experts in the ultimate Obama survival guide and here's one
[1:46:39.080 --> 1:46:42.960]  more thing for guy doesn't make a lot of money Mike I said this on Fox News two
[1:46:42.960 --> 1:46:46.320]  days ago I said you know you have like people like school teachers I don't
[1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:49.120]  mean to single out anyone but I always hear school teachers members of the
[1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:53.240]  teachers you need complaining I only make 70,000 a year I should make a
[1:46:53.240 --> 1:46:57.200]  hundred thousand I should make a hundred fifty no the taxpayers aren't
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:01.320]  responsible for your money God never woke up one day and say you have a right
[1:47:01.320 --> 1:47:05.440]  to only work one job and US Constitution doesn't say that go get a second job go
[1:47:05.440 --> 1:47:09.440]  get a third job you may have to work twice as hard to make half the money
[1:47:09.440 --> 1:47:14.240]  that's what I do how come you can't do it I have multiple careers Mike I worked
[1:47:14.240 --> 1:47:18.600]  16 hours a day I work weekends I work holidays I've never taken a full day off
[1:47:18.600 --> 1:47:22.800]  in 20 years and that's why Obama calls me rich but you know what the reality is
[1:47:22.800 --> 1:47:26.720]  I'm a very hard-working guy maybe everyone should take up that idea that
[1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:30.880]  you got to work hard in America to make money again and maybe a poor person will
[1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:35.320]  become much more successful with that mindset I completely agree I completely
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:40.160]  agree with you yeah I mean I'm in the same boat you know built built my
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:45.000]  network my system from from nothing but hard work for you know decades of hard
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:50.600]  work but you see psychologically the system today has become so invested in
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:54.840]  victimization independence correct that on on the radical left I'm going to say
[1:47:54.840 --> 1:48:00.280]  they feel like your money belongs to them you know how dare you want to keep
[1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:03.120]  your money they should get the food stamps they should get unlimited
[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:07.360]  welfare you know and Obama encourages that they want to pull you down to their
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:10.960]  level yes they do misery yes but you know listen when you talk about
[1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:15.040]  victimization I'll tell you a very funny story did you know in January did Alex
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:18.520]  Jones tell his audience in January that the United States government labeled
[1:48:18.520 --> 1:48:22.600]  anyone who has food allergies as disabled did you know that no no and I
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:26.600]  terrible food allergies my whole life and that's the reason I got into vitamins
[1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:30.040]  and health food I'm gluten tolerant and I you know I don't eat regular bread
[1:48:30.040 --> 1:48:33.920]  anymore I eat the gluten-free bread I don't want a wheelchair I don't want a
[1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:37.760]  disability check it's no big deal I've lived a wonderful life while I have
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:43.280]  terrible allergies who cares but this is all part of Obama's campaign to
[1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:47.240]  destroy us mentally and make us all believe we are weak that's right people
[1:48:47.240 --> 1:48:50.600]  have taken care of ourselves absolutely I think that's it is is
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:57.120]  essentially the Marxist mindset it sucks the soul out of humans I mean it
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:01.840]  literally sucks your soul away and leaves you as a pathetic victim of the
[1:49:01.840 --> 1:49:06.680]  you know the dependent and also a a de-educated dumb-down person you
[1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:10.520]  mentioned your daughter was homeschooled and you know Ron Paul has worked with
[1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:13.880]  Gary North to put out a homeschool curriculum that looks fantastic but
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:18.040]  public education is really about de-educating people to make them as
[1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:23.440]  George Carlin said obedient workers to the system correct how bad is that well
[1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:27.320]  I think that's the reason Obama was reelected so he's smart that's why they do that they
[1:49:27.320 --> 1:49:31.840]  push you like sheep or cattle they herd you into the public school system where
[1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:36.280]  you were taught on a daily basis is a terrible nation it is a racist nation it
[1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:39.880]  hates blacks gays and Hispanics it hates anyone who isn't white in the power
[1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:43.520]  structure and that we have to atone for terrible things we've done forever more
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:47.560]  our nation's built upon greed and you've got to elect people like Barack Obama
[1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:51.160]  with a politically correct agenda that believes in fairness equality and social
[1:49:51.160 --> 1:49:55.440]  justice and sure enough we reelected a man who has created the worst economy
[1:49:55.440 --> 1:50:00.400]  since the Great Depression in 1929 and most of the damage has been upon women
[1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:05.080]  blacks yep that's right he's damaging his own support base now we've only got a
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:08.640]  few seconds left here Wayne I want to do give out your website so people can

[1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:05.200]  hey there my name is Frank Bates do you know the number one most valuable item
[1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:10.440]  in a crisis some people think the answer is gold others think it's a gun but the
[1:52:10.440 --> 1:52:15.960]  correct answer will shock you I just created a free video at crisis123.com
[1:52:15.960 --> 1:52:22.160]  that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis 97%
[1:52:22.160 --> 1:52:25.640]  of Americans don't have this one critical item in fact they haven't even
[1:52:25.640 --> 1:52:30.360]  given it a thought and the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:35.000]  a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door but I have to
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:38.040]  tell you could literally make the difference between life and death for
[1:52:38.040 --> 1:52:43.400]  you and your family watch my video at crisis123.com to discover the number
[1:52:43.400 --> 1:52:48.000]  one most valuable item in a crisis you'll be shocked see the controversial
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:51.120]  video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last
[1:52:51.120 --> 1:52:56.640]  three months go watch my video now at crisis123.com before they force me to
[1:52:56.640 --> 1:53:01.920]  shut it down again that's crisis123.com amino acids are the building blocks of
[1:53:01.920 --> 1:53:05.360]  proteins amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that
[1:53:05.360 --> 1:53:09.440]  nature gave them if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body just
[1:53:09.440 --> 1:53:13.400]  like a brick layer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall so
[1:53:13.400 --> 1:53:17.240]  too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins
[1:53:17.240 --> 1:53:21.520]  giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in
[1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:27.000]  your health one-world-way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other you see
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:30.960]  heating bends and twists amino acids and all-way protein powders we've
[1:53:30.960 --> 1:53:35.600]  investigated and most proteins you consume are heated with our true cool
[1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:39.840]  process you now have a choice with one-world-way my name is Daniel I'm
[1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:45.040]  34 years old when I started using one-world-way I weighed 228 pounds now
[1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:50.000]  after two and a half months I weigh 182 pounds this is my deal weight I've
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:53.960]  noticed an increase in stamina rate of recovery for workouts and an increase in
[1:53:53.960 --> 1:54:01.600]  my potency call 888-988-3325 or visit one-world-way.com
[1:54:13.320 --> 1:54:18.080]  right I'm gonna cover that was that was an interesting interview with Wayne
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:23.160]  Allen root definitely a high-energy guy got some great ideas I'm gonna check out
[1:54:23.160 --> 1:54:27.120]  his book and sort of see see where he's going with all those ideas but I
[1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:31.120]  appreciate him coming on the show I like to mix up you know the guests here not
[1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:33.960]  always I don't want to have the same person on over and over and over again
[1:54:33.960 --> 1:54:39.040]  I like to like to bring in some new some new perspectives some new voices from
[1:54:39.040 --> 1:54:44.080]  time to time so I always try to reach out and bring in new people and and by
[1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:50.440]  the way Alex doesn't even normally know who I'm bringing on so it's it's if you
[1:54:50.440 --> 1:54:55.680]  if you ever wondered how this works around here when I'm hosting the truth
[1:54:55.680 --> 1:55:00.240]  is I invite my own guests and sometimes Alex will recommend you know we want
[1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:05.240]  this person on but then I'll invite a couple other guests so it's it's actually
[1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:09.840]  pretty much up to me who I bring on and that's that seems to have worked out you
[1:55:09.840 --> 1:55:15.040]  know pretty pretty well so in case you're curious Alex usually calls me he
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:22.560]  usually calls me like just a couple days before can you host like oh man I was
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:27.280]  gonna go on a picnic that day but we'll rearrange things yeah I'll come in the
[1:55:27.280 --> 1:55:31.920]  host for you anyway in this segment oh by the way we've got a guest coming up in
[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:40.080]  the next hour Dr. Chris Busby the with news about let's see the Iraq effects
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:44.160]  with depleted uranium veterans dying of cancer yeah we've covered that quite a
[1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:47.840]  bit on the show here but we'll get I guess more details on that from Dr. Busby
[1:55:47.840 --> 1:55:53.000]  when we get into the third hour but until then I wanted to read you this well
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:58.120]  not word-for-word but just go over it with you 10 civilization shaping trends
[1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:03.360]  for 2013 that are driving us into social and spiritual crisis this is an article
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:07.760]  I put together it's on info wars.com and also my website natural news.com I
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:12.160]  just want to go over this because I feel like this is really crucial for us to
[1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:16.840]  understand the big trends of what's happening so let's go over these very
[1:56:16.840 --> 1:56:21.280]  very quickly number one we've got the rise of human engineer genetics you know
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:26.040]  GMOs you're familiar with that but also now in animals and soon and babies and
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:29.360]  this is a very dangerous mad science experiment that we need to be very
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:35.560]  careful with number two the reality escapism Google Glass social networks
[1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:40.160]  online gaming they are providing venues for people to escape reality and
[1:56:40.160 --> 1:56:45.200]  actually get deeper into what I call detachment from the real world and from
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:49.240]  detachment comes all these other problems mental health problems physical
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:54.040]  health problems sociological problems and so on people don't feel like they're
[1:56:54.040 --> 1:56:58.600]  really part of a human civilization anymore they're living out their lives
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:04.120]  in these virtual worlds number three the demonization of normalcy so everything
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:08.520]  that's normal is now being demonized and everything that's freakish or
[1:57:08.520 --> 1:57:14.400]  abnormals being celebrated by the trendies so normalcy is the new closet if
[1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:17.600]  you're normal you got to hide in the closet because you know you're normal
[1:57:17.600 --> 1:57:22.120]  number four the rise of omission journalism the mainstream media is
[1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:27.560]  mostly focused now on making sure they leave things out of the news like the
[1:57:27.560 --> 1:57:32.400]  abortion murder trial in Philadelphia like the DHS bullets like the real story
[1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:35.480]  on the Boston Marathon bombing and so on it's all about what they leave out
[1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:40.840]  omission journalism number five the idiocracy effect where the people who
[1:57:40.840 --> 1:57:45.240]  are reproducing the most across the board are those who are least qualified
[1:57:45.240 --> 1:57:49.560]  to lead human civilization forward those who are most capable tend to have the
[1:57:49.560 --> 1:57:52.560]  least children and this was obviously depicted in the movie by Mike judge
[1:57:52.560 --> 1:57:56.440]  called idiocracy which took us I don't know a few hundred years in the future
[1:57:56.440 --> 1:58:01.320]  where human civilization devolved into a bunch of idiots walking around and
[1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:06.520]  anyone who used the you know big words like cognitive was considered I missed
[1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:13.480]  it mr. big words fancy pants using big words like cognitive all right we get
[1:58:13.480 --> 1:58:18.480]  into the rest of this list after we come back but number six here is the
[1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:23.160]  censorship and criminalization of knowledge we get to that and and the
[1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:25.680]  others when we come back here on the Alex Jones show stay with us we've also
[1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:30.440]  got dr. Busby straight ahead our guests for the third hour with an update on
[1:58:30.440 --> 1:58:35.120]  Fukushima and radiation plus some other news and commentary so stay with us we'll

[1:59:51.000 --> 2:00:01.000]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:12.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:12.440 --> 2:00:19.960]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:23.440]  Alex Jones
[2:00:28.480 --> 2:00:32.080]  all right we're into the third hour this is the Alex Jones show welcome back
[2:00:32.080 --> 2:00:36.920]  Mike Adams the health ranger filling in here for Alex today we've got Dr. Busby
[2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:41.720]  coming up in just a few minutes with updates on Fukushima radiation and
[2:00:41.720 --> 2:00:47.440]  radiological weapons so that should be a an interesting segment for sure that
[2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:50.280]  he's standing by we'll get to him in a few minutes but I want to continue with
[2:00:50.280 --> 2:00:56.680]  his list of 10 civilization shaping trends for 2013 not to borrow you know
[2:00:56.680 --> 2:01:01.080]  not to borrow the word trends from Gerald Salenti who's by the way probably
[2:01:01.080 --> 2:01:04.360]  my favorite guest here on the on on the show he did a great job hosting the
[2:01:04.360 --> 2:01:08.640]  other day as well but these are trends that that aren't financial trends but
[2:01:08.640 --> 2:01:14.080]  big picture trends of where we're headed so it's it's crucial to know this and
[2:01:14.080 --> 2:01:17.840]  I'll tell you why at the end because we're getting to an era that I call the
[2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:21.480]  suffering followed by what I call the rise of the consciousness movement which
[2:01:21.480 --> 2:01:25.960]  is also a spiritual renaissance movement but point number six here is the
[2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:30.920]  censorship and criminalization of knowledge now this is about the system
[2:01:30.920 --> 2:01:35.320]  the government the global globalist destroying knowledge they've already done
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:38.680]  it with nutritional supplements where it's illegal to tell the truth about how
[2:01:38.680 --> 2:01:44.800]  a natural herb or vitamin or supplement can prevent disease but they want to do
[2:01:44.800 --> 2:01:50.960]  it with all areas so they want to destroy society's memory of history and
[2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:55.600]  they're doing this by demonizing the founding fathers they're doing this by
[2:01:55.600 --> 2:01:59.400]  demonizing the Bill of Rights the Constitution by teaching a revisionist
[2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:04.840]  history in public schools and so on lots of ways that they're trying to destroy
[2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:10.840]  knowledge and make society as a whole forget where it came from and how it got
[2:02:10.840 --> 2:02:16.600]  to where we are today because if you can erase someone's memory then you can
[2:02:16.600 --> 2:02:19.760]  manipulate them which is what the government wants to do so destroying
[2:02:19.760 --> 2:02:24.400]  knowledge destroying memory is all about manipulating the immediate future
[2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:31.320]  number seven selective dehumanization and this is about abandoning the value of
[2:02:31.320 --> 2:02:36.720]  life and we see this with the abortions and the post birth abortions that you
[2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:41.400]  know the abortion murderer on trial ledged murderer on trial who was
[2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:45.640]  killing babies with you know a pair of scissors after they were born it's all
[2:02:45.640 --> 2:02:49.440]  dehumanization they count they they say they're not really babies they're just a
[2:02:49.440 --> 2:02:52.440]  choice you know dehumanized number eight the
[2:02:52.440 --> 2:02:57.540]  theorization of narratives for political gain false flags in other words this is
[2:02:57.540 --> 2:03:03.360]  this is about the government using public theater which is you know 9-11
[2:03:03.360 --> 2:03:10.680]  which is the the the Waco attack which is Sandy Hook public theater to
[2:03:10.680 --> 2:03:14.440]  accomplish its political goals because it gets so much more traction is so much
[2:03:14.440 --> 2:03:20.640]  more psychologically efficient for the government to conduct react reactionary
[2:03:20.640 --> 2:03:26.160]  theater rather than actually pursue proactive education that would move
[2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:30.240]  people in a in a positive direction they know that through terror and fear they
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:34.160]  can have highly viral memes spread throughout the population that will then
[2:03:34.160 --> 2:03:39.840]  lead to their political goals number nine the end of privacy yeah the
[2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:44.320]  government wants to end all privacy the the NSA spy center being constructed in
[2:03:44.320 --> 2:03:49.960]  Utah is all about tracking every email tweet voice phone call phone text
[2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:53.560]  everything every web address you ever visit every web form you ever fill out
[2:03:53.560 --> 2:03:58.080]  it's all gonna be tracked and cross-reference and then used to
[2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:01.520]  incriminate you and then number 10 is the rewriting of history we've covered
[2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:06.920]  this briefly before but this is really again about destroying society's memory
[2:04:06.920 --> 2:04:11.720]  so that you can manipulate people into the immediate future and where is this
[2:04:11.720 --> 2:04:15.960]  all heading us and yes you are listening to the Alice Jones show just in case
[2:04:15.960 --> 2:04:20.000]  you're wondering where all this is coming from this is heading us into an
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:27.200]  era that I call the suffering bad times are ahead in the near future I mean a
[2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:32.280]  lot of widespread death starvation economic collapse loss of freedoms and
[2:04:32.280 --> 2:04:38.200]  so on but after the suffering there will be a backlash that I'm calling the
[2:04:38.200 --> 2:04:42.400]  consciousness movement which is really a spiritual movement it is a return to
[2:04:42.400 --> 2:04:48.200]  honoring the creator to honoring seeds to honoring the existence of the human
[2:04:48.200 --> 2:04:54.200]  soul the free will it's about honoring our humanity and how we are much more
[2:04:54.200 --> 2:04:58.280]  than physical beings we are spiritual beings with a connection to the creator
[2:04:58.280 --> 2:05:03.560]  in the universe that's coming you prepare by purchasing gold food and
[2:05:03.560 --> 2:05:07.480]  firearms but if you don't have a home security system then you're missing a
[2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:11.760]  critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection when you're sleeping or away
[2:05:11.760 --> 2:05:16.320]  from home who's watching out for intruders check out simply safe it's a
[2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:21.280]  new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless go to get
[2:05:21.280 --> 2:05:26.480]  simply safe calm simply safe is independent and off the grid it runs on
[2:05:26.480 --> 2:05:31.000]  battery power so even if the grid goes down you're protected it's completely
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:35.880]  customizable so you can use it in your home business boat trailer storage unit
[2:05:35.880 --> 2:05:42.120]  or shed get simply safe calm simply safe is also ridiculously easy to install
[2:05:42.120 --> 2:05:46.160]  yourself in under 20 minutes so there's no need to let a stranger into your home
[2:05:46.160 --> 2:05:50.240]  if you move or need to relocate you can take the system with you wherever you go
[2:05:50.240 --> 2:05:54.400]  you aren't always at home but simply safe will stand guard protecting your
[2:05:54.400 --> 2:06:00.720]  property 24 hours a day seven days a week again that's get simply safe calm in
[2:06:00.720 --> 2:06:04.800]  the last two years alone the u.s. has seen huge losses to our food supply in
[2:06:04.800 --> 2:06:09.560]  2011 storms and floods raged across the u.s. costing us 20 billion and lost
[2:06:09.560 --> 2:06:13.880]  crops alone in 2012 we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50
[2:06:13.880 --> 2:06:17.880]  years you may think out of sight out of mind and so you don't think you will be
[2:06:17.880 --> 2:06:22.800]  affected the fact is you are we all are food shortages drive prices up for
[2:06:22.800 --> 2:06:26.680]  everyone you might not be able to control mother nature but you can control
[2:06:26.680 --> 2:06:31.080]  your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with

[2:06:57.360 --> 2:07:02.200]  slash Alex you can bet your life on e-foods direct I had tried everything I'd
[2:07:02.200 --> 2:07:06.200]  cut back the amount of food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but
[2:07:06.200 --> 2:07:10.440]  nothing was working my body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[2:07:10.440 --> 2:07:15.240]  elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could
[2:07:15.240 --> 2:07:19.680]  eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied now there are
[2:07:19.680 --> 2:07:23.440]  hundreds of great products at info wars team dot com but I want to point out the
[2:07:23.440 --> 2:07:31.600]  three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months products like beyond
[2:07:31.600 --> 2:07:36.120]  tangy tangerine pollen burst and rebound when I started taking the tangy
[2:07:36.120 --> 2:07:40.680]  tangerine and other products every day I lost more than 37 pounds in just two
[2:07:40.680 --> 2:07:45.600]  months now that's results I want to challenge my listeners to go to info
[2:07:45.600 --> 2:07:50.160]  wars team dot com and to order just three of their products and you will see
[2:07:50.160 --> 2:07:54.960]  the changes in the way you look feel and in your appetite almost immediately

[2:08:20.480 --> 2:08:32.480]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic its Alex Jones yes
[2:08:32.480 --> 2:08:37.320]  this is the Alex Jones show this is the third hour welcome back we are
[2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:40.880]  featuring this hour in interview with dr. Christopher Busby an expert on
[2:08:40.880 --> 2:08:46.320]  radiation and Fukushima who has been very outspoken about the dangers of even
[2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:52.040]  low levels of ionizing radiation from not just the Fukushima disaster but other
[2:08:52.040 --> 2:08:57.400]  radiological events and he joins us by Skype now to give us the latest breakdown
[2:08:57.400 --> 2:09:04.000]  on radiological weapons a little bit of update on Fukushima and some thyroid
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:07.960]  problems in children a few other points as well welcome to the show dr. Busby
[2:09:07.960 --> 2:09:13.400]  yes hello I'm talking to you from regard I headed off to the woods and I'm not in
[2:09:13.400 --> 2:09:19.200]  the woods in my little house in Latvia and what I want to talk to you about
[2:09:19.200 --> 2:09:24.440]  really I mean it's my main thing but I'll just plug it again is what I see
[2:09:24.440 --> 2:09:30.320]  as the and what actually is the biggest human health public health scandal of
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:36.520]  all time which is which is this release to the environment by scientists since
[2:09:36.520 --> 2:09:41.640]  1945 of all these radioactive substances like strontium 19
[2:09:41.640 --> 2:09:48.440]  gluttonium 239 and cesium 137 and all that and this whole umbrella of this
[2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:52.200]  this radiological public health scandal covers all of the things that I've
[2:09:52.200 --> 2:09:57.480]  researched in the last 20 years Fukushima Chernobyl that nuclear increases in
[2:09:57.480 --> 2:10:02.480]  childhood cancer in nuclear sites contaminated see there's we've done
[2:10:02.480 --> 2:10:07.000]  work on the Baltic Sea on the Irish Sea and most most recently of course I've
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:12.480]  been involved in looking at depleted uranium and and even some kind of new
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:17.320]  enriched uranium weapon which has been deployed by the Israelis in Lebanon and
[2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:22.160]  also in in Fallujah as we found out and published in the literature so it's
[2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:26.440]  made me public enemy number one of course amongst the people who plug nuclear
[2:10:26.440 --> 2:10:30.600]  power stations well I'm sure but but if you look at the sources of all this so
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:33.680]  you're talking about not only nuclear power but nuclear weapons testing
[2:10:33.680 --> 2:10:40.120]  obviously did you get into a nuclear medical exposure well nuclear medical
[2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:45.520]  exposure is mostly external and this is and I think it's quite relevant for me
[2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:49.880]  to point out that that that that it's not about low-level radiation the
[2:10:49.880 --> 2:10:54.280]  argument is not about low-level radiation it's about external and internal
[2:10:54.280 --> 2:10:59.840]  radiation because actually radiation is measured in in various units Millie
[2:10:59.840 --> 2:11:06.080]  Sieverts and Millie Rads and these these units relate to energy that's transferred
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:10.640]  to the human body so it's a it's a it's a physics-based unit that is used and the
[2:11:10.640 --> 2:11:14.000]  problem is the big problem is that it doesn't work for internal radio
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:19.760]  nuclides and and I can briefly explain why the the the the transfer of
[2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:23.520]  external energy like gamma rays into the body is the same as sitting in front of
[2:11:23.520 --> 2:11:27.080]  the fire and heating yourself and warming yourself up you can take get so
[2:11:27.080 --> 2:11:32.400]  many joules per kilogram of your body in terms of heat energy but you could get
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:35.760]  the same number of joules per kilogram into your body if you reached into the
[2:11:35.760 --> 2:11:40.320]  fire and you ate a hot coal and that's a very very reasonable analogy but the
[2:11:40.320 --> 2:11:44.680]  difference between standing somewhere where the radioactivity level is
[2:11:44.680 --> 2:11:48.160]  slightly higher so you've got external radiation like from an x-ray machine or
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:52.160]  something like that which is actually not that it may be low-level radiation
[2:11:52.160 --> 2:11:56.720]  but it's not a big deal but but then ingesting or inhaling radioactive
[2:11:56.720 --> 2:12:01.800]  iodine like for instance from Fukushima or or particles of depleted uranium from
[2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:08.080]  some weaponized use in in Iraq those things these those tiny tiny particles
[2:12:08.080 --> 2:12:11.360]  and the internal radio nuclides that damage the DNA they are the serious
[2:12:11.360 --> 2:12:16.160]  problem and that is the biggest public health scandal of all time so yes sorry
[2:12:16.160 --> 2:12:22.840]  no I just want to ask you the question so yeah so externally the the radioactive
[2:12:22.840 --> 2:12:31.640]  particles your you are subject to them via the inverse square law right then
[2:12:31.640 --> 2:12:36.600]  internally your distance to the particle is zero absolutely so and a lot of these
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:40.040]  particles are alpha emitters too which which normally an alpha particle
[2:12:40.040 --> 2:12:44.040]  wouldn't pass through your skin but but uranium for example tonium they're
[2:12:44.040 --> 2:12:47.640]  alpha alpha emitters and they're sitting inside you and so they only have a very
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:52.560]  short range and they damage they produce enormous local doses to cells so it
[2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:57.360]  isn't at all low-level radiation but the con is this that the nuclear industry or
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:02.200]  in fact the military who started this way back in the 50s but the car the con is
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:06.040]  that they dilute all of that energy into the whole body whereas actually the
[2:13:06.040 --> 2:13:12.640]  energy is all in one place right on the DNA yeah in terms of outrageous well in
[2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:15.560]  terms of internal sources and this is fascinating I've got a lot of questions
[2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:21.200]  for you already but in your assessment is it a higher risk of internal exposure
[2:13:21.200 --> 2:13:26.160]  through inhalation of airborne particles or is it through eating food no it's
[2:13:26.160 --> 2:13:29.440]  more it says more from inhalation inhalation and the reason is quite
[2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:35.680]  simple that over in over evolutionary timescales that the gut has found at
[2:13:35.680 --> 2:13:38.680]  ways of excluding a lot of these radionuclides because a lot of them there
[2:13:38.680 --> 2:13:44.480]  are a lot of natural radionuclides like radium and uranium thorium and daughters
[2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:49.080]  of these substances which occur naturally and the guts seems to be quite
[2:13:49.080 --> 2:13:53.120]  clever at keeping a lot of this stuff out but if it's inhaled it gets into the
[2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:58.280]  lungs it goes through the lungs into the into the tracheobronchial lymph nodes
[2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:01.960]  and then the lymphatic system can take it out anywhere and in particular where
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:05.920]  it takes it is to the female breast because that's quite close by and so
[2:14:05.920 --> 2:14:09.120]  these particles get into the female breast so we find high levels of breast
[2:14:09.120 --> 2:14:14.720]  cancer in in people who live downwind or close to nuclear power stations for
[2:14:14.720 --> 2:14:19.160]  example I mean there's an awful lot of who are about childhood leukemia near
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:22.960]  nuclear power stations but nobody's been looking at adults who live near nuclear
[2:14:22.960 --> 2:14:27.200]  power station for simple reason that the cancer registries refused to release
[2:14:27.200 --> 2:14:31.840]  that release the data not we've had to knock on doors in order to do these
[2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:38.080]  studies so which which radiological isotopes are more likely to be airborne
[2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:44.680]  for example downwind from Fukushima is someone likely to inhale particle of
[2:14:44.680 --> 2:14:51.800]  cesium no no no uranium all of yes all of the effects in Iraq consequence of
[2:14:51.800 --> 2:14:55.520]  the use of uranium weapons I don't say depleted uranium weapons because we've
[2:14:55.520 --> 2:14:59.680]  actually measured this stuff and we found that since about 2003 since the
[2:14:59.680 --> 2:15:03.640]  second Gulf War that they've been using ordinary uranium or even slightly
[2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:06.760]  enriched uranium which is something which is a bit bit odd which we don't
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:11.760]  quite understand and it may well be and I've suggested this a consequence of a
[2:15:11.760 --> 2:15:15.720]  new type of weapon which is a which is a fusion weapon but I mean whether
[2:15:15.720 --> 2:15:19.440]  whether that's true or not certainly uranium is the thing that's going that
[2:15:19.440 --> 2:15:24.520]  is causing the effects in in Iraq and my feeling is probably uranium particles
[2:15:24.520 --> 2:15:27.880]  are what causes the effects downwind of nuclear power stations because at the
[2:15:27.880 --> 2:15:31.920]  end of the day it's uranium is what they run on uranium is what they run on I
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:36.480]  mean I've done a number of studies for example up in in America around near
[2:15:36.480 --> 2:15:42.520]  Los Angeles around the Santa Susana site there the field laboratory where
[2:15:42.520 --> 2:15:45.520]  people are all dying like flies all around there and nobody seems to figure
[2:15:45.520 --> 2:15:49.120]  out how it works but if you look through the data if you look through the
[2:15:49.120 --> 2:15:52.880]  environmental reports of Boeing and Rocketdyne who are the people who run
[2:15:52.880 --> 2:15:56.600]  the operation you find that there's enormous amounts of enriched uranium in
[2:15:56.600 --> 2:16:00.440]  the air filters but nobody looks at uranium because it's kind of thought
[2:16:00.440 --> 2:16:03.880]  to be a natural and somehow therefore safe but of course the particularized
[2:16:03.880 --> 2:16:07.960]  version of it is certainly not natural and it's certainly not safe what what
[2:16:07.960 --> 2:16:12.320]  isotopes of uranium are you are likely to be airborne and what's what kind of
[2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:18.520]  half-life are we talking about there well the half-life is 4.7 billion years I
[2:16:18.520 --> 2:16:25.000]  mean that's quite a long time the uranium in fact uranium is the problem
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:28.960]  that they have when they try to bury nuclear waste I mean another study
[2:16:28.960 --> 2:16:37.000]  that I've done is to is to look at the Swedish proposals to build a nuclear
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:42.240]  waste site underneath the Baltic Sea which is already the most radioactive
[2:16:42.240 --> 2:16:46.560]  sea in the world and by the time all of the other radionuclides like cesium
[2:16:46.560 --> 2:16:49.560]  and strontium and all the short-lived stuff has gone away the uranium and the
[2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:52.880]  radium is still there because some of those things have enormously long
[2:16:52.880 --> 2:16:56.960]  half-life they have geological half-lives but of course the particles
[2:16:56.960 --> 2:17:01.160]  won't stay there forever the particles are produced in when the weapons are
[2:17:01.160 --> 2:17:04.000]  used and they go up in the air and then they land in the desert and they hang
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:08.600]  around for quite a long time my feeling they still are there I was in Iraq in
[2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:13.000]  2001 I went there with Al Jazeera a lot of measuring equipment and everything
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:17.720]  and I found a lot of depleted uranium particles there are from the first
[2:17:17.720 --> 2:17:21.680]  Gulf War so that was like 10 years later yeah well we also see in the veterans
[2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:27.000]  who are around the DU weapons they they are exhibiting very high rates of
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:31.840]  cancer and I think you mentioned that's true yes I've done some I've done some
[2:17:31.840 --> 2:17:37.600]  studies I've been called in as an expert recently on a number of United
[2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:41.960]  Kingdom veterans who were deployed in the second Gulf War in the first Gulf War
[2:17:41.960 --> 2:17:45.720]  and they they were basically cleaning out vehicles had been struck by depleted
[2:17:45.720 --> 2:17:51.720]  uranium bullets and they've got they've got lymphomas and they've got colon
[2:17:51.720 --> 2:17:55.480]  cancer too and they're two of them with colon cancer and the odds against that
[2:17:55.480 --> 2:17:59.360]  happening I can tell you at the age because they're only they're both 40 at
[2:17:59.360 --> 2:18:04.880]  that age the odds against both of them getting colon cancer is one in 780
[2:18:04.880 --> 2:18:09.760]  thousands that that's the lifetime on so it's quite obviously the uranium that
[2:18:09.760 --> 2:18:13.320]  scores the colon cancer but but the government and the military they just
[2:18:13.320 --> 2:18:16.920]  refuse to concede all of this stuff and it's impossible to do any research
[2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:20.960]  because the cancer registries won't release the data right right the this
[2:18:20.960 --> 2:18:24.640]  is the this is a global cover-up but it's also easy to sweep on the rug
[2:18:24.640 --> 2:18:30.360]  because so many of the symptoms of radiological poisoning are they they
[2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:35.480]  they can be diagnosed as something different and the symptoms can take a
[2:18:35.480 --> 2:18:40.200]  long time to be diagnosable well that's the main problem it's like stabbing
[2:18:40.200 --> 2:18:44.240]  somebody and then they die 20 years later right and so it's quite hard to do
[2:18:44.240 --> 2:18:48.240]  those sorts of cases but it's not it's getting easier I have to say and the
[2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:53.720]  the problem also of course is this that in the last 10 years we've realized a
[2:18:53.720 --> 2:18:57.920]  lot more about the way in which there's been a lot of research done and this
[2:18:57.920 --> 2:19:02.360]  hasn't fed through into the people who regulate the limits and so on but
[2:19:02.360 --> 2:19:06.520]  anyway what what we found out is that radiation doesn't just give you cancer
[2:19:06.520 --> 2:19:12.480]  it gives you heart attacks it damages your children it it more or less increases
[2:19:12.480 --> 2:19:16.120]  the rate of just about every illness that there is so it's a kind of premature
[2:19:16.120 --> 2:19:22.120]  aging yeah like a stealth epidemic yeah so if you're looking I mean for instance
[2:19:22.120 --> 2:19:26.640]  if you want to do a study and you look for you look for increases in cancer you
[2:19:26.640 --> 2:19:30.520]  won't only find increases in cancer and because of that you don't find as high
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:33.960]  an increase in cancer as you might predict and the reason is that people
[2:19:33.960 --> 2:19:37.800]  die of something else before they get cancer cancer cancer's an old age it's
[2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:44.280]  something that increases that we are going to take a quick break but stay

[2:24:16.920 --> 2:24:20.400]  we're continuing our interview with doctor Chris Busby here on the Alex Jones
[2:24:20.400 --> 2:24:25.080]  show this is Mike Adams filling in for Alex today and we are focused on
[2:24:25.080 --> 2:24:30.200]  radiological poisoning specifically uranium is our focus in this part of
[2:24:30.200 --> 2:24:35.000]  the conversation but just before we go back to doctor Busby there is some
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:38.040]  breaking news is being broadcast on the mainstream media right now apparently
[2:24:38.040 --> 2:24:43.160]  some friends of the alleged Boston Marathon bombers are being arrested and
[2:24:43.160 --> 2:24:49.520]  charged with lying to the government so there you go if you lie to the government
[2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:52.280]  I guess they had some fireworks or something that they they threw away
[2:24:52.280 --> 2:24:58.520]  before the FBI showed up so the details are sketchy but we'll see where that
[2:24:58.520 --> 2:25:02.480]  goes but God forbid anyone who lies to the government because the government
[2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:06.800]  always tells us the truth especially in the nuclear industry right and this is
[2:25:06.800 --> 2:25:11.440]  our conversation with dr. Busby where here's my question it seems like the
[2:25:11.440 --> 2:25:16.280]  defense industry or the weapons industry let's call it has a very deeply
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:22.760]  invested interest in protecting its investment in nuclear products and
[2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:26.680]  also the nuclear power industry so you've got these two very powerful
[2:25:26.680 --> 2:25:30.760]  industries that want this truth to remain a secret it seems and it seems
[2:25:30.760 --> 2:25:34.880]  like you're you're knocking heads with these two industries quite frequently
[2:25:34.880 --> 2:25:40.960]  yes that's right actually in the in the 50s is when it really got bad and
[2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:44.240]  that's when it all started because they wanted to like as you say they wanted to
[2:25:44.240 --> 2:25:50.400]  to test nuclear weapons in the atmosphere and it was quickly becoming
[2:25:50.400 --> 2:25:54.520]  apparent that this was killing people so what they did was that they forced they
[2:25:54.520 --> 2:25:58.920]  they forced all of this information underground and by 1959 there was an
[2:25:58.920 --> 2:26:02.800]  agreement between the World Health Organization and the International
[2:26:02.800 --> 2:26:08.120]  Atomic Energy Agency whereby all of the research into this the health effects
[2:26:08.120 --> 2:26:13.160]  of radiation of the type of radiation I'm talking about and was put into the
[2:26:13.160 --> 2:26:17.400]  hands of the International Atomic Energy Agency now I also and this still goes
[2:26:17.400 --> 2:26:22.160]  on because I was in I was in Brussels talking about the we've made a petition
[2:26:22.160 --> 2:26:25.440]  incidentally there is something that people can do about this so we have a
[2:26:25.440 --> 2:26:31.520]  website which we set up last year called nuclearjustice.org we formed an
[2:26:31.520 --> 2:26:35.640]  international committee for nuclear justice in Vilnius Lithuania and so
[2:26:35.640 --> 2:26:38.840]  this this is some people can get in touch with us there are petitions that
[2:26:38.840 --> 2:26:43.920]  can be used based on human rights anyway my point is I went I went to to
[2:26:43.920 --> 2:26:48.080]  Brussels to to make an intervention on behalf of the green group of the European
[2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:53.480]  Parliament and I was I was talking about this whole issue and what I learned
[2:26:53.480 --> 2:26:58.480]  there was that the the new the new radiation protection legislation which
[2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:01.920]  is going through which I was asked to go and talk about is going to be put in the
[2:27:01.920 --> 2:27:05.720]  hands of the people who in the hands of the industry rather than the hands of
[2:27:05.720 --> 2:27:08.000]  the Environment Committee because they have these different committees in the
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:12.560]  European Union and they have a committee that's involved in environment and
[2:27:12.560 --> 2:27:16.000]  health and there are another committee that's involved or directorate that's
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:22.440]  involved in in looking after industry so it's the industry committee is going to
[2:27:22.440 --> 2:27:26.360]  be dealing with the legislation relating to radiation and this is exactly like it
[2:27:26.360 --> 2:27:30.560]  happened in the 50s where they gave the the protection of human beings and the
[2:27:30.560 --> 2:27:34.160]  protection of the environment into the hands of the International Atomic Energy
[2:27:34.160 --> 2:27:38.920]  Agency and over to the very people who are the problem exactly exactly but you
[2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:43.200]  know I mean I was very interested earlier on in your list of and I quite went
[2:27:43.200 --> 2:27:46.520]  along with a lot of that stuff you know the what I would call the
[2:27:46.520 --> 2:27:52.160]  Sovietization of the planet actually yeah because although the Soviet Union has
[2:27:52.160 --> 2:27:56.120]  collapsed all of the things that the Soviet Union went in for all of this
[2:27:56.120 --> 2:28:01.560]  airbrushing of history and the teaching of nonsense and all the things that you
[2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:05.160]  talk about have now have now become mainstream in the United States and
[2:28:05.160 --> 2:28:09.240]  certainly in my country in England as well too really basically if you want to
[2:28:09.240 --> 2:28:13.360]  learn something you go to the Internet and then you just have to kind of sift
[2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:16.680]  through all the crazy stuff but basically you get a much better idea of
[2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:19.400]  what's going on than if you listen to the news or if you look in the newspaper
[2:28:19.400 --> 2:28:23.160]  well I think that this nuclear industry is this is a classic example of where
[2:28:23.160 --> 2:28:28.080]  they are attempting to destroy actual knowledge destroy history and and
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:33.240]  spoon feed you a new narrative that is at odds with physical reality or in this
[2:28:33.240 --> 2:28:39.800]  case actual physics yeah well the thing I've thought a lot about this and I've
[2:28:39.800 --> 2:28:43.440]  concluded that I mean because you have to either think well they're just bad
[2:28:43.440 --> 2:28:47.400]  people or evil or something and you they have seen how can they possibly go in
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:50.760]  for all of this nonsense so and then you can say well they might have a lot of
[2:28:50.760 --> 2:28:53.600]  money people give them money in brown envelopes and all this and there's a
[2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:57.120]  probably a bit of that happens as well but my feeling is that it's a way of
[2:28:57.120 --> 2:29:01.720]  looking at the world and this way of looking at the world arrived in the
[2:29:01.720 --> 2:29:07.000]  last century with science itself and in some way science itself especially
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:11.520]  physics actually physicists seem to be able to believe stuff that everybody
[2:29:11.520 --> 2:29:15.560]  thinks has manifest nonsense and they and they can somehow control they can
[2:29:15.560 --> 2:29:19.000]  control the way in which the world works by by saying well look we're much
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:22.080]  cleverer than you are and you have to listen to what we say because we can do
[2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:26.760]  mathematics and you can't yeah and most of the people like the politicians who
[2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:31.080]  are all stupid anyway you know most of them that that they're desperate to
[2:29:31.080 --> 2:29:35.920]  show that they are as clever as the physicists so it's kind of with us we
[2:29:35.920 --> 2:29:39.120]  got to go to a quick break here but stay with us a little long segment with
[2:29:39.120 --> 2:29:43.360]  you afterwards I want to get into this with you to talk about this this
[2:29:43.360 --> 2:29:47.640]  scientific dictatorship in a sense where just exactly what you said they're
[2:29:47.640 --> 2:29:51.680]  trying to shove this down our throats and it's not true we're on the March the

[2:33:29.720 --> 2:33:34.920]  alright we're continuing our interview with Dr. Chris Busby an expert on
[2:33:34.920 --> 2:33:41.560]  ionizing radiation and he helped create the website nuclear justice org and we
[2:33:41.560 --> 2:33:45.240]  have a long segment here with him just before the break Dr. Busby mentioned
[2:33:45.240 --> 2:33:53.920]  that there are some let's say fundamental themes of conventional science that
[2:33:53.920 --> 2:33:59.840]  that he believes are not legitimate or I'm paraphrasing but I'd like to ask you
[2:33:59.840 --> 2:34:03.880]  about that Dr. Busby what what are the things about modern science that you
[2:34:03.880 --> 2:34:09.720]  think need to be questioned well I think the problem is that that science became
[2:34:09.720 --> 2:34:15.160]  a very very powerful machine from it's in from from when it began probably in
[2:34:15.160 --> 2:34:19.920]  about the 15th century and it was based on empirical evidence so what happened
[2:34:19.920 --> 2:34:24.440]  is that that rather than just come out and say this is so because because the
[2:34:24.440 --> 2:34:28.800]  church teaches that it's so let's have a look and see whether it works and so
[2:34:28.800 --> 2:34:32.880]  they do an experiment and the experiment would show whatever it showed and very
[2:34:32.880 --> 2:34:36.680]  often that would be that would be that would be something that wasn't
[2:34:36.680 --> 2:34:41.160]  expected and they would have to re re jig the whole understanding of reality
[2:34:41.160 --> 2:34:45.800]  to fit in with experimental work and you remember Galileo Galileo was
[2:34:45.800 --> 2:34:49.360]  challenged by the Inquisition because he said that there were the moons of
[2:34:49.360 --> 2:34:54.680]  Jupiter and in the Bertolt Brecht play of Galileo he actually shows the
[2:34:54.680 --> 2:34:59.680]  inquisitors that through his telescope the moons of Jupiter and they say as I
[2:34:59.680 --> 2:35:04.160]  recall they say well these this must be a very uncertain machine and we don't
[2:35:04.160 --> 2:35:07.400]  really believe in this machine if it shows something that cannot exist all
[2:35:07.400 --> 2:35:11.960]  right anyway the point is that that's exactly the situation we have now we
[2:35:11.960 --> 2:35:16.560]  have for example many many studies that show that there's an increase in
[2:35:16.560 --> 2:35:21.840]  childhood leukemia around nuclear sites but the nuclear but the the radiation
[2:35:21.840 --> 2:35:27.560]  risk organizations the United Nations scientific committee the United
[2:35:27.560 --> 2:35:31.560]  Nate in the United States the the various committees there and RC and so on
[2:35:31.560 --> 2:35:36.640]  and in and the international committee on radiological protection which was
[2:35:36.640 --> 2:35:41.880]  based in Sweden is now based in Canada these committees are controlling the
[2:35:41.880 --> 2:35:45.600]  understanding of the health effects of radiation and they continue to act
[2:35:45.600 --> 2:35:49.560]  exactly like the Inquisition they say yes well these childhood leukemias cannot
[2:35:49.560 --> 2:35:54.080]  exist because we know that they cannot exist because our formulae say that
[2:35:54.080 --> 2:35:57.600]  they cannot exist and that's the situation we know that's exactly it
[2:35:57.600 --> 2:36:03.000]  I've talked about this as well the the scientific method it is predicated on
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:07.640]  the idea that you must assess all the available evidence and then sort it out
[2:36:07.640 --> 2:36:11.560]  you can't filter selectively the evidence that you don't like because it
[2:36:11.560 --> 2:36:16.280]  disagrees with your preconceived notion of what the theory is but that's what we
[2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:21.080]  see well they're two philosophical rules there there's the rules of induction and
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:24.680]  the rules of deduction so what they say is that they know how much cancer is
[2:36:24.680 --> 2:36:28.880]  caused by radiation on the basis of experiments that have been done on the
[2:36:28.880 --> 2:36:33.240]  survivors of the Hiroshima bomb okay and that was all external radiation and it
[2:36:33.240 --> 2:36:37.600]  was a very big dose and therefore on the basis of that theory this and this is a
[2:36:37.600 --> 2:36:41.720]  formula this is an equation okay mathematics we're back to mathematics
[2:36:41.720 --> 2:36:45.880]  on the basis of this mathematical equation it's impossible that these
[2:36:45.880 --> 2:36:50.200]  children you know the nuclear sites could could have their cancers or as a
[2:36:50.200 --> 2:36:53.800]  consequence of radiation and the same thing happens with Fukushima we have
[2:36:53.800 --> 2:36:58.000]  the World Health Organization now came out with a big document recently that
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:01.480]  said that the effects of the Fukushima accident because the doses were so small
[2:37:01.480 --> 2:37:05.200]  are not even going to be measurable and and in the middle of all this people
[2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:09.920]  people are having 40% increase in that no no that 40% of the people of the
[2:37:09.920 --> 2:37:13.680]  children tested have got thyroid nodules people are just falling down dead all
[2:37:13.680 --> 2:37:17.080]  over the place and there's lots of evidence that they're covering it all
[2:37:17.080 --> 2:37:21.960]  up so and this is exactly like Galileo this is this is a failure of science
[2:37:21.960 --> 2:37:26.840]  so so in many ways I agree with you in many ways modern science has become the
[2:37:26.840 --> 2:37:33.720]  new dogmatic church that that science originally fought against because we're
[2:37:33.720 --> 2:37:36.240]  supposed to be based on actual evidence I remember having a conversation
[2:37:36.240 --> 2:37:41.000]  recently with a physicist just about the table of elements and and I asked about
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:45.600]  mercury and and how toxic was mercury and he spelled it out for me oh this is
[2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:51.000]  extremely toxic a potent neurotoxin and toxic to biology at many many different
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:54.840]  levels and and and then I asked him I said well so what do you think about
[2:37:54.840 --> 2:37:59.840]  injecting children with trace amounts of mercury and he said no that's extremely
[2:37:59.840 --> 2:38:03.240]  dangerous should never be done it's not human I said well what about injecting a
[2:38:03.240 --> 2:38:08.440]  child with a vaccine and he said oh well it's okay in that case yeah yeah I know
[2:38:08.440 --> 2:38:12.160]  well you know that the problem the problem I mean I actually I have to
[2:38:12.160 --> 2:38:16.440]  blame Einstein for this because if you go back far enough what you find is that
[2:38:16.440 --> 2:38:22.200]  the Victorian science was generally understood it was like common sense but
[2:38:22.200 --> 2:38:26.800]  then round about the 1920s like between 1905 when when they came out with
[2:38:26.800 --> 2:38:30.920]  special relativity through to about 1930 the whole thing was turned on its head
[2:38:30.920 --> 2:38:35.800]  and suddenly we had to believe stuff that was manifestly impossible and and the
[2:38:35.800 --> 2:38:39.440]  people who went to the top of the list who said these things were the
[2:38:39.440 --> 2:38:42.360]  physicists the mathematical physicists and if you look if you look in
[2:38:42.360 --> 2:38:45.160]  government now if you look in the UK government you can American government
[2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:48.920]  you look all over the place you can the European Union you find that the people
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:52.400]  who are the advisors the senior advisor to government are always mathematical
[2:38:52.400 --> 2:38:55.800]  physicists and those are people who can believe virtually anything now some but
[2:38:55.800 --> 2:38:59.160]  somebody should point out to them that they appear to have lost 95% of the
[2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:04.960]  universe as a result of that question exactly so we have to believe these
[2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:09.160]  guys when they tell us that these radiation effects are harmless when in
[2:39:09.160 --> 2:39:13.080]  fact we see in front of our in every study that we do that people are dying
[2:39:13.080 --> 2:39:16.760]  all over the place when it's terrible when they say they've discovered the
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:20.920]  God particle but all it is is a statistical anomaly it's not at first of
[2:39:20.920 --> 2:39:26.360]  all it's not a particle and it's not God and it's a statistical you know it's
[2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:30.080]  it's it they didn't really find something that you can look at it's not
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:33.960]  the point is when they do these experiments what they do is they don't
[2:39:33.960 --> 2:39:37.960]  actually see anything right they do is they have a huge computer program which
[2:39:37.960 --> 2:39:41.400]  analyzes all of the stuff that's going on inside this this machine that they've
[2:39:41.400 --> 2:39:45.280]  got where they're smashing things together at enormous energies and then
[2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:49.080]  they apply all of the equations that they figured out long ago are the right
[2:39:49.080 --> 2:39:52.760]  equations and they come out with answers which which may or may not be right but
[2:39:52.760 --> 2:39:55.800]  maybe the equations are wrong in the first place that's the point yeah it's
[2:39:55.800 --> 2:40:00.600]  all mathematical it's exactly like the the analysis of the health effects of
[2:40:00.600 --> 2:40:03.680]  radiation where it's a mathematical equation it says it can't happen so they
[2:40:03.680 --> 2:40:06.960]  say it's impossible and yet there's some dead person sitting in front lying in
[2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:10.120]  front of them in the road and they say well this person cannot exist just like
[2:40:10.120 --> 2:40:14.440]  the like Galileo and the Inquisition anyway we have to do something about it
[2:40:14.440 --> 2:40:17.360]  you know we have we have to stop believing these physicists we have to
[2:40:17.360 --> 2:40:21.480]  start taking control of this whole area and getting hold of the information
[2:40:21.480 --> 2:40:25.880]  itself I mean why is it that the cancer registries are allowed to refuse to
[2:40:25.880 --> 2:40:30.200]  release data about the levels of cancer around nuclear plants or around areas
[2:40:30.200 --> 2:40:35.720]  where there's radiation why yeah I mean it must be it's a lot of interest well
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:39.200]  in addition to your site nuclear justice org is there another website where
[2:40:39.200 --> 2:40:43.400]  people can stay up-to-date with your investigation yes yes there is well
[2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:46.640]  that there are there are a couple of websites that they should look at one
[2:40:46.640 --> 2:40:53.000]  one is the low-level radiation campaign website which is LLRC.org low-level
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:56.680]  radiation campaign and if they want to and if they want to look at the work
[2:40:56.680 --> 2:41:02.800]  I've done they look at the green audit so it's www.greenaudit.org so those two
[2:41:02.800 --> 2:41:06.640]  websites have most of the stuff that we are we are doing if they look on my
[2:41:06.640 --> 2:41:10.720]  Wikipedia entry incidentally they will find that I'm every sort of scurrilous
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:16.000]  you know idiot because the nuclear industry have a whole team of people
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:23.400]  that spend their whole time cutting me down on the internet and I just don't have the time
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:26.880]  to deal with it all you know I'd have to have a whole department of people just
[2:41:26.880 --> 2:41:31.680]  checking no Wikipedia entries a sort of battle of the song Wikipedia is largely
[2:41:31.680 --> 2:41:35.880]  discredited on anything that that threatens corporate interests yeah the
[2:41:35.880 --> 2:41:39.720]  teams of trolls work work on that but I want to get back because you mentioned
[2:41:39.720 --> 2:41:43.920]  the history of physics and development of much of this knowledge base you know
[2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:48.200]  if you look back to the early physicists who were who were investigating
[2:41:48.200 --> 2:41:53.240]  radiation you know even at the time they said it wasn't dangerous and a lot of
[2:41:53.240 --> 2:41:57.520]  them died from cancer like Curie and and many others who were experimenting and
[2:41:57.520 --> 2:42:03.840]  even trying to isolate as up to that point unknown elements in the table of
[2:42:03.840 --> 2:42:08.400]  elements they died from radiation poisoning yes and a lot of them burn
[2:42:08.400 --> 2:42:12.840]  their arms off and and got cancer as a result of using those x-ray tubes and
[2:42:12.840 --> 2:42:16.240]  so on and somehow we're led to believe that everything is okay anyway the point
[2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:20.000]  is that if you look at the the limits the dose limits if you go right back to
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:23.720]  that early time and look at the dose limits and what and watch them through
[2:42:23.720 --> 2:42:26.680]  the whole of the last century find they go down and down and down and down and
[2:42:26.680 --> 2:42:31.080]  down and down exponentially and eventually in 1990 or so they hit the one
[2:42:31.080 --> 2:42:34.760]  millisiever level which is the legal limit today but the reason they don't go
[2:42:34.760 --> 2:42:38.160]  down any further which of course they should do the reason they don't go down
[2:42:38.160 --> 2:42:41.000]  any further is because the nuclear industry wouldn't be able to function
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:43.960]  and the military wouldn't be able to function if that if that went down any
[2:42:43.960 --> 2:42:48.360]  further but as I said before you know that the important thing is not the
[2:42:48.360 --> 2:42:53.160]  actual radiation dose it's where it's from it's what it's from we have we have
[2:42:53.160 --> 2:42:56.800]  places in the world now which have become absolutely dangerous to live near
[2:42:56.800 --> 2:43:00.640]  and this is what nuclear justice is about it's to try and use human rights
[2:43:00.640 --> 2:43:05.440]  legislation to raise that issue because we have the Baltic Sea some of those
[2:43:05.440 --> 2:43:10.320]  geographical locations yes yes we are that it's where it's places where radio
[2:43:10.320 --> 2:43:13.880]  activity has accumulated so you've got quite a few of them in America you've
[2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:20.880]  got the Hanford site in Washington you've got you've got Oak Ridge you've
[2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:25.960]  got certainly certainly Los Angeles Santa's up in northwest and Santa
[2:43:25.960 --> 2:43:29.560]  Susana up in the Seamy Hills there that's an area which is massively
[2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:34.320]  contaminated with radioactivity from the from the Rocketdyne operation and the
[2:43:34.320 --> 2:43:38.920]  there was an explosion there in 1959 I think it is right there from the sodium
[2:43:38.920 --> 2:43:42.920]  reactor which which which melted down and and spewed stuff all over the place
[2:43:42.920 --> 2:43:49.080]  that's that's quite a dangerous place so the Irish Sea and the Baltic Sea yes
[2:43:49.080 --> 2:43:53.720]  sorry but but I want to understand how how do these radioactive particles get
[2:43:53.720 --> 2:43:57.600]  kicked up into the air is it from wind is it a farmer plowing a field how does
[2:43:57.600 --> 2:44:02.280]  that happen that's of well all of those things but but actually if we were to go
[2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:08.640]  to for instance the Los Angeles one it's caused by disturbing the soil so
[2:44:08.640 --> 2:44:13.080]  what they've been doing there since about 1995 to 2005 they were knocking
[2:44:13.080 --> 2:44:17.800]  down buildings and remediating the land and trucking a lot of this stuff out on
[2:44:17.800 --> 2:44:22.440]  trucks and of course it just generated vast amounts of dust actually farmers
[2:44:22.440 --> 2:44:27.120]  for example if you take farmers the highest the highest rates of leukemia
[2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:31.400]  and lymphoma in terms of occupations are from farmers because of course they
[2:44:31.400 --> 2:44:35.160]  they they plow up the fields and that's got all the weapons fall out on them then
[2:44:35.160 --> 2:44:38.600]  the other very interesting one which is certainly are going to affect people in
[2:44:38.600 --> 2:44:43.200]  Japan is what's called sea-to-land transfer if you if you dump all this
[2:44:43.200 --> 2:44:47.360]  radio-nuclide stuff into the sea what happens is it is it adheres to the
[2:44:47.360 --> 2:44:51.960]  surface it adsorbs on the surface of clays and fine particles and so when
[2:44:51.960 --> 2:44:55.560]  that when the waves crash into the beach and you get those white horses those
[2:44:55.560 --> 2:44:59.560]  bubbles turn inside out and they force this stuff up into the air and there's
[2:44:59.560 --> 2:45:04.240]  this phenomenon called sea-to-land transfer which is quite well described
[2:45:04.240 --> 2:45:07.240]  in the literature I mean people have measured plutonium by distance from the
[2:45:07.240 --> 2:45:11.640]  sea in the Irish sea and basically people living within about one kilometer
[2:45:11.640 --> 2:45:16.080]  kilometer from the sea get a much higher level of cancer and I've done
[2:45:16.080 --> 2:45:19.400]  so I've done studies that show that and that's why because they inhale this
[2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:23.040]  stuff from the sea-to-land transfer and that's going to affect people all along
[2:45:23.040 --> 2:45:26.480]  the east coast of Japan it certainly affects people in the Irish sea where
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:30.080]  cellar field releases this stuff into the Irish sea and it will affect people in
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:37.120]  the Baltic Sea too. Dr. Busby is there a handheld radiation detection device that
[2:45:37.120 --> 2:45:42.480]  a consumer could use to determine whether such particles are airborne near them?
[2:45:42.480 --> 2:45:47.400]  No not really not sensitive enough. No because it's for the same reason that I
[2:45:47.400 --> 2:45:52.520]  said that the what the what the handheld radiation detector does no matter how
[2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:57.800]  sensitive it is is it measures dose so it can only average over the the size of
[2:45:57.800 --> 2:46:01.720]  the machine that's being used and so these little particles wouldn't
[2:46:01.720 --> 2:46:04.680]  wouldn't wouldn't have any effect on that. I mean there are ways in which you
[2:46:04.680 --> 2:46:08.360]  can deal with it but a bit complicated you have to get sticky filters so you
[2:46:08.360 --> 2:46:12.560]  put up some sellotape on on a piece of paper and then it sticks to the
[2:46:12.560 --> 2:46:15.800]  sellotape and then you can put something called you can put a plastic on there
[2:46:15.800 --> 2:46:20.000]  called CR39 and then you can see the tracks when you when you or you can
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:26.200]  put some photographic film as well and in fact a colleague of mine in America in
[2:46:26.200 --> 2:46:32.400]  the United States looked at some of the dust from Fukushima and was able to
[2:46:32.400 --> 2:46:37.840]  image these particles quite quite easily. Well it seems critical really for
[2:46:37.840 --> 2:46:41.600]  especially people living near these areas that you identify as possibly having
[2:46:41.600 --> 2:46:46.200]  high levels of latent radioactive particles to be able to have some kind
[2:46:46.200 --> 2:46:51.800]  of a device or something they can purchase to determine. I agree with you
[2:46:51.800 --> 2:46:55.400]  but that but that basically there isn't anything I mean well all you can do is
[2:46:55.400 --> 2:46:59.240]  you can you can bulk this stuff so so what you can do is you can look at
[2:46:59.240 --> 2:47:03.200]  vehicle air filters for example which is what I did in Fukushima I got a lot of
[2:47:03.200 --> 2:47:06.640]  Japanese people to send me their the filters from their from their motor
[2:47:06.640 --> 2:47:10.400]  cars and then what we did is we measured the in bulk we measured the
[2:47:10.400 --> 2:47:14.360]  concentrations of material in the in those filters and one filter I got sent
[2:47:14.360 --> 2:47:19.480]  by a lady in central Tokyo so she was she was living in an apartment which was
[2:47:19.480 --> 2:47:23.320]  300 meters from the Tokyo Tower and she sent me her air conditioning filter
[2:47:23.320 --> 2:47:26.760]  which was inside the room that she lived in so it was inside it did just
[2:47:26.760 --> 2:47:31.400]  circulated air inside the room and there was about 120,000 becarols per
[2:47:31.400 --> 2:47:36.080]  kilogram of cesium in that filter there was a lot of uranium 235 uranium 238
[2:47:36.080 --> 2:47:40.600]  there was lead 210 which nobody had detected but obviously a lot of lead
[2:47:40.600 --> 2:47:44.800]  210 was coming out of Fukushima so that was quite and I put I put up a video I
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:48.480]  put up a video on YouTube about that it's quite a scary business because
[2:47:48.480 --> 2:47:53.200]  this is Tokyo population 36 million yeah and the really scary thing is that your
[2:47:53.200 --> 2:47:58.320]  lungs are the filter I mean if you walk around breathing in that area you you
[2:47:58.320 --> 2:48:00.960]  are accumulating all that in your lungs that's the whole that's the whole point
[2:48:00.960 --> 2:48:05.920]  that's that's my point I mean we can't take somebody's lung and measured it
[2:48:05.920 --> 2:48:08.760]  but we can certainly take a filter out of a car and measure it and so if the
[2:48:08.760 --> 2:48:13.320]  filter intercepts material as it gets sucked into the engine we can have a
[2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:17.760]  fairly good idea of how fast the engine is in turning turning and how much air
[2:48:17.760 --> 2:48:21.040]  goes through it and the efficiency of the filter and all that sort of stuff so
[2:48:21.040 --> 2:48:25.480]  how effective would it like an N95 mask be you know that the kind of mask that
[2:48:25.480 --> 2:48:29.640]  people use for flu pandemics and things that block what you mean just a little
[2:48:29.640 --> 2:48:34.200]  monkey monkey mask little white things no they're useless yeah that's what I
[2:48:34.200 --> 2:48:38.600]  think you have to have one you have to have a proper aerosol mask like the
[2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:43.080]  sort of thing that you you would buy for working with with dangerous aerosols
[2:48:43.080 --> 2:48:46.880]  like something that feels around your face yeah yeah that's right you'd have
[2:48:46.880 --> 2:48:50.600]  to use that and even that even that won't won't intercept some of these
[2:48:50.600 --> 2:48:55.040]  very small uranium particles that they use in that are created in in in
[2:48:55.040 --> 2:49:00.240]  weaponization those things are down in the 15 nanometer 250 nanometer range
[2:49:00.240 --> 2:49:03.920]  and they've got straight through any of those things so straight through the
[2:49:03.920 --> 2:49:10.120]  skin what they go straight to the skin yeah yeah that's the nanoparticles which
[2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:13.880]  is like a big deal now everybody's researching nanoparticles I mean nanoparticles
[2:49:13.880 --> 2:49:18.440]  go straight through the skin that's how they that's how all these things
[2:49:18.440 --> 2:49:22.520]  make women look younger you know they just put the paste on it goes through
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:25.120]  the skin it plumps the skin out and makes them look younger but are you
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:29.080]  saying that they're radioactive uranium particles that are nano-sized that can
[2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:33.440]  yes yes absolutely that the Americans when they were you first developing this
[2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:39.320]  stuff they did measurements of the where's the summer and it's they have a
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:42.480]  they have a base in America I can't remember the name offhand anyway so they
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:49.280]  did impact collections using various systems that that measured that the the
[2:49:49.280 --> 2:49:52.560]  diameter of the part basically what you're saying is we're all screwed is
[2:49:52.560 --> 2:49:56.920]  what you're saying we're all screwed unless we can stop this and stop these
[2:49:56.920 --> 2:50:00.760]  people using them yeah this is what I say well somebody I mean I was I was
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:04.680]  asked by Russia today to contribute to some program and they said what and they
[2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:09.560]  what they said what's the most most serious read radiation or nuclear
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:13.240]  hazard in existence at the moment they were talking about the strategic arms
[2:50:13.240 --> 2:50:17.680]  limitation talks you know and whether Iran is going to drop a bomb on Iraq and
[2:50:17.680 --> 2:50:22.280]  on Israel but actually this has been going on for a very long time it
[2:50:22.280 --> 2:50:27.080]  already exists that the most the most serious item in this whole area is the
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:32.760]  refusal of the international committees that legislate about exposures to
[2:50:32.760 --> 2:50:38.160]  concede that there is a huge problem right denial that's it yeah well well
[2:50:38.160 --> 2:50:41.080]  Dr. Busby we're out of time but I want to thank you for joining me today it's
[2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:45.720]  been a fascinating discussion okay okay thank you we got to go we got to go to
[2:50:45.720 --> 2:50:51.440]  break here but folks Dr. Busby what website is nuclearjustice.org and thank
[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:55.680]  you once again Dr. Busby for joining us okay thanks bye all right bye bye we'll

[2:54:12.240 --> 2:54:16.720]  okay final segment here on the Alex Jones show we just interviewed Dr. Chris
[2:54:16.720 --> 2:54:23.080]  Busby who had some frightening information that possibly these these
[2:54:23.080 --> 2:54:29.880]  radioactive nanoparticles can penetrate your skin and thus having a mask may
[2:54:29.880 --> 2:54:34.240]  not may not really help you so great as I said in the last segment I guess that
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:38.440]  means we're all screwed unless we somehow managed to raise awareness on this
[2:54:38.440 --> 2:54:44.400]  which Dr. Busby is attempting to do and shut down the nuclear industry I did
[2:54:44.400 --> 2:54:49.640]  read that some fusion experiments are are underway or being being constructed
[2:54:49.640 --> 2:54:54.080]  and about to commence that would be a hot fusion energy generation that would
[2:54:54.080 --> 2:54:59.240]  make a fission obsolete fission is you know conventional nuclear power to make
[2:54:59.240 --> 2:55:04.280]  that a completely obsolete so there are possibly some solutions but that could
[2:55:04.280 --> 2:55:09.040]  be many decades away I wouldn't bet on it and besides you know the government
[2:55:09.040 --> 2:55:13.160]  loves to have a nuclear industry because the side effect is weapons grade
[2:55:13.160 --> 2:55:17.400]  plutonium so you know and your uranium and you know weapons grade materials
[2:55:17.400 --> 2:55:22.640]  basically but in in the final few minutes of today's show I wanted to go
[2:55:22.640 --> 2:55:25.680]  through some of the headlines that we failed to get to earlier just to give
[2:55:25.680 --> 2:55:31.200]  you a sense of the total insanity that is now taken over our society so here we
[2:55:31.200 --> 2:55:36.400]  go we've got a company so far a company that is telling its employees to get a
[2:55:36.400 --> 2:55:43.240]  tattoo of the company logo and then they will get raises a 15% pay raise
[2:55:43.240 --> 2:55:47.880]  we're getting a tattoo of the company logo how well yeah like you won't
[2:55:47.880 --> 2:55:52.960]  regret that 10 years later like a walking billboard of some now bankrupt
[2:55:52.960 --> 2:55:59.840]  corporation three dead 17 wounded in shootings just in Chicago in one night
[2:55:59.840 --> 2:56:06.200]  yep that's Chicago for you the the gunfree zone where everybody gets shot
[2:56:06.200 --> 2:56:12.120]  oh here we go athletes out of the closet I don't know why we're celebrating this
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:17.760]  NBA star who announced he's gay I don't know what the big deal is either way what
[2:56:17.760 --> 2:56:25.560]  was sexual orientation of these of these NBA players and NFL players I just I
[2:56:25.560 --> 2:56:29.000]  mean really do we have to worship everybody who comes out of the closet
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:33.160]  now I mean I guess the day is coming when we're gonna have to it's gonna get so
[2:56:33.160 --> 2:56:37.160]  popular to be gay that we're gonna have to worship an athlete a male athlete
[2:56:37.160 --> 2:56:42.000]  that actually likes to sleep with women you know that's gonna be an anomaly you
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:46.680]  know oh my god today Jeffrey Jones came out of the closet he likes women my
[2:56:46.680 --> 2:56:52.240]  god so unpopular so bizarre what a freak of nature it's gonna get that

[2:56:58.040 --> 2:57:03.320]  you want just don't push it on me okay Bloomberg murder rate comments he said
[2:57:03.320 --> 2:57:09.400]  we're sad and inappropriate for public officials to tout their their crime
[2:57:09.400 --> 2:57:12.520]  fighting efforts by highlighting other cities and murder rates in other words
[2:57:12.520 --> 2:57:16.320]  he's saying you're not supposed to talk about the murder rate in Chicago or
[2:57:16.320 --> 2:57:21.520]  New York especially New York being that it's a Bloomberg eating disorders
[2:57:21.520 --> 2:57:26.920]  orthorexia on the rise and by the way they considered an eating disorder if
[2:57:26.920 --> 2:57:31.480]  you're into nutrition yeah if you if you read ingredients labels that's a
[2:57:31.480 --> 2:57:34.840]  disorder you might have a psychiatric disorder because you read ingredients
[2:57:34.840 --> 2:57:39.040]  labels because you don't want to consume you know aspartame or MSG how
[2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:45.960]  about some GPS tags for dementia patients let's track granny before we
