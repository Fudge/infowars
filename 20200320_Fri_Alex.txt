[00:00.000 --> 00:19.300]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:19.300 --> 00:37.060]  We are already under overlying fields, crisscrossing fields of martial law, and I'm going to exclusively
[00:37.060 --> 00:42.360]  lay out to you how martial law has been incrementally implemented and has already secretly been
[00:42.360 --> 00:49.820]  declared by different parties who are putting the planet into an unprecedented crisis to
[00:49.820 --> 00:56.020]  create unrest down the road that they believe will allow the globalist and corporations
[00:56.020 --> 01:01.860]  to gang up with authoritarian regimes on nation states, on populist, on Christian countries,
[01:01.860 --> 01:07.420]  on patriots, and overthrow those regimes.
[01:07.420 --> 01:13.980]  This is World War I. I agree with the Pentagon that World War III was the Cold War.
[01:13.980 --> 01:23.260]  This is asymmetrical fifth sixth generation economic culture bio warfare.
[01:23.260 --> 01:29.540]  The definition in black's law dictionary is the proper definition under U.S. law for
[01:29.540 --> 01:36.300]  martial law, martial law which is built upon no settled principles but is entirely arbitrary
[01:36.300 --> 01:42.420]  and its decisions is in truth and reality no law but something indulged rather than
[01:42.420 --> 01:44.220]  allowed as a law.
[01:44.220 --> 01:51.940]  The necessity of order and discipline in an army is the only thing which can give it countenance
[01:51.940 --> 01:56.780]  and therefore it ought not be permitted in time a peace when the king's courts are open
[01:56.780 --> 02:01.020]  for all persons to receive justice according to laws of the land.
[02:01.020 --> 02:04.700]  But the courts are closing, the schools are closing, the restaurants are closing.
[02:04.700 --> 02:06.820]  First was you can have drive through.
[02:06.820 --> 02:11.780]  Now all over the country they're announcing you can't have drive through.
[02:11.780 --> 02:16.420]  And the governor of New York, the tyrant, who said if you're a Christian or a gun owner
[02:16.420 --> 02:20.100]  or pro-life get out of the state.
[02:20.100 --> 02:25.100]  He now has declared an emergency and told New Yorkers don't leave your homes.
[02:25.100 --> 02:32.660]  Following the governor of California who gave a press conference last night I watched the
[02:32.660 --> 02:35.620]  whole hour and 15 minute press conference.
[02:35.620 --> 02:42.700]  I couldn't sleep so I got up at 3 a.m. and watched it and I sent the link out to some
[02:42.700 --> 02:47.540]  of our writers and they went he didn't really say they're looking at martial law and I said
[02:47.540 --> 02:51.820]  no it's it's it's in the video here's an article they just couldn't believe me they
[02:51.820 --> 02:59.660]  just didn't compute it just no we're not doing an article is it true so so that's the level
[02:59.660 --> 03:04.780]  that we've reached I sent it to Watson I sent to others and they're just not computing
[03:04.780 --> 03:09.860]  that you're already in the martial law and now they're closing the tourniquet.
[03:09.860 --> 03:14.500]  Here are the other headlines and other definitions.
[03:14.500 --> 03:19.100]  Marion Webster the law administered by military force that is invoked by a government an emergency
[03:19.100 --> 03:23.340]  when the civilian law enforcement agencies are able to maintain public order and safety.
[03:23.340 --> 03:27.420]  Wikipedia the imposition of direct military control over normal civilian functions by
[03:27.420 --> 03:32.780]  government especially in response to a temporary emergency such as invasion or major disaster
[03:32.780 --> 03:37.220]  or in occupied territory and it's the latter we're being occupied by the crisis but I'm
[03:37.220 --> 03:40.460]  going to explain that with the nuances when we return.
[03:40.460 --> 03:45.420]  Encyclopedia Britannica oh and I'm going to show you the governor saying it.
[03:45.420 --> 03:49.620]  Encyclopedia Britannica temporary world by military authorities of a designated area
[03:49.620 --> 03:54.340]  and time of emergency when the civilian authorities are deemed unable to function the legal effects
[03:54.340 --> 03:57.420]  of the declaration of martial law different in various jurisdictions but they generally
[03:57.420 --> 04:03.660]  involve the suspension of normal civil rights and the extension to the civilian population
[04:03.660 --> 04:09.380]  of summary military justice or a military law although temporary in theory they said
[04:09.380 --> 04:17.940]  a martial law may in effect continue indefinitely and notice they're telling you now 18 months
[04:17.940 --> 04:24.300]  it was two weeks in Europe then it was a month it was two weeks in China then it was a month
[04:24.300 --> 04:29.100]  but now we're told it's oh it's just 18 months now it's saying no no no that's not enough
[04:29.100 --> 04:34.540]  maybe three years don't leave your house for three years wow that's the most hardcore martial
[04:34.540 --> 04:39.180]  law the planet's ever seen have another name for it it's called the population under siege
[04:39.180 --> 04:44.420]  so you get in there and you plug into that television set and the drones will deliver
[04:44.420 --> 04:48.140]  you your medicine and your food of course it's all going to run out in just a few months
[04:48.140 --> 04:53.060]  they admit which will cause the great depression but go ahead and be scared of the virus you're
[04:53.060 --> 04:56.700]  going to really love the great depression
[04:56.700 --> 05:06.540]  info wars has had to suspend all new food sales because the supply chain has collapsed
[05:06.540 --> 05:13.620]  this is a system-wide problem and this country is facing a new depression unless trump and
[05:13.620 --> 05:19.740]  the american people work together to develop a plan to expose this globalist operation
[05:19.740 --> 05:25.940]  that said people are calling and saying we wish you had the supplements in stock we wish
[05:25.940 --> 05:31.580]  that wasn't sold out they've confused that with the food everything we advertise everything
[05:31.580 --> 05:38.780]  we sell we have in stock and we are only one day behind in shipping that means if you order
[05:38.780 --> 05:44.700]  on a monday it's shipping out on a wednesday and that's just as of today most days we are
[05:44.700 --> 05:49.220]  up to the day shipping meaning you order that day in the morning a lot of times it ships
[05:49.220 --> 05:58.300]  out that afternoon we have everything in stock that is so good to boost your overall defense
[05:58.300 --> 06:25.460]  against what's going on
[06:25.460 --> 06:47.940]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this friday march 20th 2020 global transmission
[06:47.940 --> 06:55.940]  with 227 227 days out from the historic election that may be canceled now don't even hear about
[06:55.940 --> 07:03.860]  joe biden anymore because the world is going into martial law and i want to quantify what
[07:03.860 --> 07:10.740]  martial law composed of the different types of it around the different parts of the world
[07:10.740 --> 07:19.260]  how it's implemented and where it tends to lead nations but the democrats have followed
[07:19.260 --> 07:30.900]  the lead of the dictatorial e u and the communist chinese and their dictator and they have by
[07:30.900 --> 07:38.620]  example established martial law shooting people at checkpoints welding them into their homes
[07:38.620 --> 07:44.860]  pits burning bodies making sure to show you the footage to scare you as much as possible
[07:44.860 --> 07:50.140]  and then as soon as the west picked up the panic china said we're done no more virus
[07:50.140 --> 07:56.620]  100% back to work we were only shut down about a month or so but in america it's going to
[07:56.620 --> 08:05.380]  be 18 months we're told which will mean we will no longer exist except the big box stores
[08:05.380 --> 08:09.380]  and those that are part of critical infrastructure they're allowed to keep operating and you're
[08:09.380 --> 08:14.020]  going to learn to be very dependent on them and then checks will be given to you even
[08:14.020 --> 08:21.580]  if you didn't want to be on welfare show that you can go buy at the big box stores and you've
[08:21.580 --> 08:26.140]  got to go out with your permission slip that you're going that you'll get from walmart
[08:26.140 --> 08:30.780]  or target and then you'll drive in and the police will check you at a checkpoint and
[08:30.780 --> 08:34.580]  then you'll go in wearing your mask and you'll get your food once a week when you're allowed
[08:34.580 --> 08:41.860]  out of your house and you will go home or you will face six months in jail but criminals
[08:41.860 --> 08:45.460]  armed robbers rapists they're all being let out of jail by the tens of thousands the
[08:45.460 --> 08:53.340]  day now the homeless are exempt in new york and in california and the migrants and homeless
[08:53.340 --> 08:58.500]  in europe the is the islamics they're all exempt swedens banned all air travel in and
[08:58.500 --> 09:03.940]  out of the country except for soros you and funded aircraft that land multiple times daily
[09:03.940 --> 09:08.300]  from the middle east of north africa bringing in military age men those are exempt that's
[09:08.300 --> 09:16.260]  it news wars dot com and europe wars dot com we had direct links to the swedish news so
[09:16.260 --> 09:20.500]  the criminals can run around wild the homeless can run around wild the illegal aliens can
[09:20.500 --> 09:26.740]  run around wild the borders can pretty much still be open and porous but you are going
[09:26.740 --> 09:36.340]  to stay in your house you dirty stinking american and if your neighbor sees your cough you're
[09:36.340 --> 09:42.860]  being taken away for six weeks it's all being announced it's all globally standardized and
[09:42.860 --> 09:47.020]  then china used it as a pretext to grab their political enemies england's announced you'll
[09:47.020 --> 09:50.900]  be grabbed and disappeared for six weeks and now they're announcing you'll be grabbed and
[09:50.900 --> 09:55.340]  disappeared for six weeks in california and in new york and it's all standardized and
[09:55.340 --> 10:01.060]  china is now the savior it's not called the chinese virus or the wuhan virus it's now
[10:01.060 --> 10:11.060]  called covid-19 and it's all trump's fault he didn't respond properly and his hundreds
[10:11.060 --> 10:16.620]  start to die every week and then thousands just like the flu you'll be told it's the
[10:16.620 --> 10:25.180]  end of the world and your guns and your property and your life and your business is all forfeit
[10:25.180 --> 10:31.740]  and we're just all so conditioned here and info wars has been such the tip of the spear
[10:31.740 --> 10:35.940]  that last night i saw this headline on an independent coronavirus california prepares
[10:35.940 --> 10:42.300]  to enact martial law if necessary governor says so i sent it out i'm not criticizing
[10:42.300 --> 10:46.220]  paul watson i'm not just criticizing his brother steve watson he's in the background
[10:46.220 --> 10:51.340]  just as smart as paul i'm not criticizing all my other riders the ball you know head
[10:51.340 --> 10:56.580]  for the hills nobody's here at the office except the career on the show now all run
[10:56.580 --> 11:00.660]  for the hills that's fine but everybody's just like oh we're just used to martial law
[11:00.660 --> 11:05.620]  yeah it doesn't matter we broke it and pioneered it literally there's a mental block no article
[11:05.620 --> 11:16.860]  about it i mean saying 40 million people don't leave your house is bad enough but then to
[11:16.860 --> 11:20.620]  say we might just enact full martial law but we're not sure we need that yet we're gonna
[11:20.620 --> 11:26.500]  get you really scared for we call it the big scary word so we're already under FEMA national
[11:26.500 --> 11:33.060]  emergency and the war powers has been declared and so that's a form of martial law and trump
[11:33.060 --> 11:37.620]  was pushed into that because every death is his fault and again we're shut down 18 months
[11:37.620 --> 11:42.140]  china a month it's all an economic weapon and the same media that prays china is gonna
[11:42.140 --> 11:48.340]  attack trump at every level and it first kind of act like oh the politicians okay we're
[11:48.340 --> 11:52.340]  not gonna attack you but once the deaths mount they'll then say you didn't do enough early
[11:52.340 --> 11:56.140]  enough plus you crashed the market and then they're gonna trigger civil unrest because
[11:56.140 --> 12:00.860]  when they try to shut down all the businesses and can trick trump into pure martial law
[12:00.860 --> 12:05.580]  or let the governors and and and mayors do it by themselves that will trigger looting
[12:05.580 --> 12:10.020]  and robbing and out of control behavior because the people are gonna run out of food and so
[12:10.020 --> 12:15.620]  they're deliberately creating like with a chemistry set a reaction that's going to cause
[12:15.620 --> 12:26.660]  an explosion and so this is how the west dies this is how america dies this is how it all
[12:26.660 --> 12:36.900]  unfolds i'm the martial law man i'm the guy that told you all these secretive preparations
[12:36.900 --> 12:41.100]  are being made for decades by the globalist and and i know that the globalist don't like
[12:41.100 --> 12:45.260]  trump and we had some patriots in the government the people that helped get trump elected and
[12:45.260 --> 12:50.180]  he's really tried to write the ship and and get better deals for america but he's been
[12:50.180 --> 12:56.060]  hit now with total hysteria by the corporations the media foreign governments and we have
[12:56.060 --> 12:59.740]  whole articles remember three weeks ago four weeks ago we're like why are they flying people
[12:59.740 --> 13:05.780]  from china untested back to san antonio and dropping them off at the mall and then they
[13:05.780 --> 13:15.660]  released a woman they knew had covet nineteen the chinese virus they did it on purpose they
[13:15.660 --> 13:20.260]  incubated it the cdc's got a bunch of globalists in it they're the worst the worst they're
[13:20.260 --> 13:24.340]  a bunch of eugenicists they're part of this mad scientist cult and they did all this on
[13:24.340 --> 13:33.660]  purpose so remember china's fine they're open for business no big deal now but here it's
[13:33.660 --> 13:38.380]  over eighteen months it's over your job your business it's over they've got talking heads
[13:38.380 --> 13:47.700]  everywhere telling you that it is a depression here here's some of the governor we've got
[13:47.700 --> 13:52.580]  more of him but here's the little darling of dancy polosi he's married into the family
[13:52.580 --> 14:03.540]  here's here's gavin newson up there just happy is the american psycho he is just telling
[14:03.540 --> 14:06.820]  you how he's going to save you from the horrible thing that's coming by locking you up in your
[14:06.820 --> 14:10.340]  house and well we're not sure if marshal laws eat it right yet even though we're already
[14:10.340 --> 14:16.540]  under it here it is you were issuing a directive about bars and nightclubs and restaurants and
[14:16.540 --> 14:21.980]  as well as nursing homes is that an order by the governor of california by force of law
[14:21.980 --> 14:26.820]  it's exactly the same guidance we put out as it relates to social functions that are
[14:26.820 --> 14:32.700]  not essential north of two hundred and fifty and those that are not essential for vulnerable
[14:32.700 --> 14:39.980]  populations of ten or less what happened you saw is it was it was overwhelmingly positively
[14:39.980 --> 14:46.300]  embraced some communities even went further we have absolute expectation this will be
[14:46.300 --> 14:51.700]  socialized in real time we've had the privilege of talking to many many mayors today and county
[14:51.700 --> 14:56.900]  leaders that are hopeful we were moving in this direction and i have all the confidence
[14:56.900 --> 15:03.300]  in the world these guidance along the same lines that we advanced on large gatherings
[15:03.300 --> 15:09.700]  will take shape the governor of illinois and ohio ordered the closure we could do that
[15:09.700 --> 15:16.500]  easily because we it's a it's a nuance and distinction we get caught up in because to
[15:16.500 --> 15:21.020]  date we haven't needed to do that we've set out guidance those guidance that guidance
[15:21.020 --> 15:25.860]  has been met in every circumstance and as i said in the past if you want to establish
[15:25.860 --> 15:32.060]  a framework of martial law which is ultimate authority and enforcement we have the capacity
[15:32.060 --> 15:38.300]  to do that but we are not at this moment feeling that is a necessity and to the extent that
[15:38.300 --> 15:44.020]  people do not socialize and support this very directive guidance i would be surprised and
[15:44.020 --> 15:47.820]  we have all the confidence it will be guys tell the idiot member of the globalist press
[15:47.820 --> 15:52.060]  listen when you're putting handcuffs on a woman you want to tell her it should be all right
[15:52.060 --> 15:56.540]  then you take her down in the basement torture to death let us get the handcuffs on them first

[20:50.500 --> 20:55.580]  electing populace and nationalist and prosperity is taking place and we're turning the tide
[20:55.580 --> 21:03.380]  against the pedophile movement that powers the luciferian left and they don't know what
[21:03.380 --> 21:09.100]  to do and so they're using their economic power through communist governments authoritarian
[21:09.100 --> 21:16.260]  eu the big mega banks and the media to cut off industry to show the example of shutting
[21:16.260 --> 21:27.100]  down infrastructure to then have government order it and it's following an exact choreographed
[21:27.100 --> 21:33.660]  track towards the announcement of martial law now last sunday we put out a headline
[21:33.660 --> 21:42.260]  that trump considering declaring interstate travel ban well hell forget interstate travel
[21:42.260 --> 21:49.980]  ban you've got multiple governors california new york saying don't leave your house how
[21:49.980 --> 21:54.540]  many millions is that 40 million in california and what is it 28 million or something in new
[21:54.540 --> 22:02.940]  york last time i checked what's population new york that's martial law trump just expanded
[22:02.940 --> 22:07.260]  coronavirus travel ban to the uk and ireland hints at domestic restrictions that was just
[22:07.260 --> 22:13.660]  an oppressed conference today heli's in one right now so i said trump to announce interstate
[22:13.660 --> 22:19.500]  travel ban as early as tonight experts are meeting with him right now i said on sunday
[22:19.500 --> 22:24.220]  trying to talk him out of it from the federalist society and that's now been confirmed the next
[22:24.220 --> 22:31.060]  day that trump was considering it well i've talked to a lot of military sources low level
[22:31.060 --> 22:35.140]  and high level i've talked to a lot of police sources i've talked to governmental sources
[22:35.140 --> 22:39.980]  i've talked to legal sources and they say that trump is gauging at all and tried to
[22:39.980 --> 22:44.580]  buck china and the e you set in the press for that we already be under this but then
[22:44.580 --> 22:50.140]  they're criticizing him saying hasn't done enough they want internal controls not external
[22:50.140 --> 22:54.020]  even joe biden still saying it's xenophobic to stop chinese flying here doesn't know what
[22:54.020 --> 23:02.740]  planet he's on china shoots you at checkpoints but we can't stop chinese flying here so trump
[23:02.740 --> 23:06.060]  is stuck in this balancing act he knows this is going to kill the economy he knows they're
[23:06.060 --> 23:10.860]  trying to remove him from office he knows that they're hyping this up bigger than it
[23:10.860 --> 23:15.340]  is yeah it's going to probably kill tens of thousands of people still we're in asia 330
[23:15.340 --> 23:22.060]  plus million and so they're trying to stampede him into this but through the governors through
[23:22.060 --> 23:26.980]  the corporations through the media they've already declared their own little marshal
[23:26.980 --> 23:31.040]  laws they've already said don't leave your homes they've already said you've got a line
[23:31.040 --> 23:34.860]  up and only come into cost go 20 at a time and stay back 10 feet or security guards will
[23:34.860 --> 23:38.020]  throw you out they've already said we're gonna shut down all the small businesses will let
[23:38.020 --> 23:45.220]  the big ones stay open we're gonna bail out the big ones but not to you or per capita
[23:45.220 --> 23:51.020]  you'll get much less than the establishment does this is a globalist takeover this is
[23:51.020 --> 23:54.660]  teaching you to work from home teaching you that you've got to be tracked by a cell phone
[23:54.660 --> 23:59.020]  to go outside we talked about china a month ago tracking people with their cell phones
[23:59.020 --> 24:07.140]  before they can leave their houses making them download a government app well now we
[24:07.140 --> 24:15.340]  broke on monday drugreport.com picked it up that mit and bill among the gates have a plan
[24:15.340 --> 24:20.380]  to make you wear a bracelet that changes colors and a digital tattoo you take under the skin
[24:20.380 --> 24:24.260]  that shows you've been inoculated and that they'll track you by your cell phone where
[24:24.260 --> 24:30.400]  you go and what you do that is in the news today covid-19 tracking bracelets and invisible
[24:30.400 --> 24:37.660]  tattoos to monitor americans asia deploys innovative evinvasive tech to curb virus and
[24:37.660 --> 24:45.660]  what to say cell phones that track you bracelets digital tattoos y'all who knows so see it's
[24:45.660 --> 24:54.100]  a global standardized well planned out operation that's why the cdc in november we reported
[24:54.100 --> 24:57.300]  on this weeks ago mike adams is with us in the fourth hour did a great job write the
[24:57.300 --> 25:04.340]  big article about it yesterday because he's not got enough tension that the cdc didn't
[25:04.340 --> 25:07.420]  just bring in people that had coronavirus knowingly all over the country and drop them
[25:07.420 --> 25:14.620]  off and they knew they had it like in san Antonio then san Antonio declared emergency three
[25:14.620 --> 25:20.900]  weeks ago four weeks ago but they brought in thousands of people out of china and dropped
[25:20.900 --> 25:32.620]  them off and now we know that the cdc in november prepared for mass quarantines and hired the
[25:32.620 --> 25:37.820]  most amount of mass quarantine experts they've ever done in one month so yes they were coordinating
[25:37.820 --> 25:41.940]  with the deep state and the globalist i don't believe trump was involved because the deep
[25:41.940 --> 25:46.300]  states all around in healing has a small beachhead up there and i predicted eight weeks ago they
[25:46.300 --> 25:50.220]  would then frame trump for the virus and say he had a bad response and that he would move
[25:50.220 --> 25:53.980]  on from china we'd forget what happened there it would all be about us and we'd have much
[25:53.980 --> 26:00.740]  greater restrictions and the media would work against the president openly exactly that
[26:00.740 --> 26:04.660]  happened because we know it's man made we know the chai comms work with the global deep
[26:04.660 --> 26:09.980]  state we know that they prepared it we saw all the pre-programming we saw the disease
[26:09.980 --> 26:13.340]  x the unannounced two years ago that was coming that would change our lives forever and the
[26:13.340 --> 26:17.420]  tabletop exercise four months ago with bill linda gates was 65 million dead and with the
[26:17.420 --> 26:25.580]  coronavirus they scripted it all they beta tested all how do you know a new chevy vehicles
[26:25.580 --> 26:31.460]  coming out you see ads for it it's coming well same thing with this a giant pre-programmed
[26:31.460 --> 26:39.180]  control grid and so trump looks ineffectual if he doesn't bring in his martial law hey
[26:39.180 --> 26:46.020]  we're going to save people i'm the american psycho gabin nuesome notice california last
[26:46.020 --> 26:52.900]  year passed a law that you can give somebody hiv that can kill them or hepatitis that can
[26:52.900 --> 26:58.860]  kill them and it's okay to knowingly because it's like a cult thing with some of the radical
[26:58.860 --> 27:02.540]  leftist homosexuals to give each other disease and to spread it that's on record called bug
[27:02.540 --> 27:10.620]  chasers gift givers gift receivers and they just said hey it's not a felony it's not even
[27:10.620 --> 27:17.500]  an issue now just kill people that passed the same senator now says he wants pedophilia
[27:17.500 --> 27:24.260]  legalized same guy that got that passed says he wants it legalized california set the legalized
[27:24.260 --> 27:31.420]  pedophilia by the way porn hub up to 68 thousand child rape videos on there and they say they're
[27:31.420 --> 27:37.740]  allowed to do it the fed say hey you're porn hub you're allowed to have child rape you
[27:37.740 --> 27:43.700]  see so oh my gosh we're going to give people hepatitis that kills tens of thousands a
[27:43.700 --> 27:47.100]  year we're going to give them hiv that kills tens of thousands a year in the us we're going
[27:47.100 --> 27:52.420]  to do all of this and that's okay but oh my gosh if california has a you know a 50 people
[27:52.420 --> 27:58.220]  dead or whatever from coronavirus it's the end of the world and american psycho gabin
[27:58.220 --> 28:02.060]  newson's going to strut around we come back on the plate five minutes of his press conference
[28:02.060 --> 28:06.060]  where he gets into the marshal law and oh no no he says the reporter says don't we need

[32:17.180 --> 32:23.340]  months but 18 months bringing us into the greatest oppression that planet's ever seen china says
[32:23.340 --> 32:29.260]  everything's fine now and they're back to business they launched their hysteria they triggered the
[32:29.260 --> 32:37.260]  insanity america took the bait and now we're going down unless humanity awakens and understands
[32:37.260 --> 32:42.940]  the virus is manmade and understands that these restrictions overall are not being used to protect
[32:42.940 --> 32:49.820]  us from the virus but are being used to set the precedent for a giant controlled system and permanent
[32:49.820 --> 32:57.340]  martial law that will be used to overthrow trump and bring in pure globalist tyranny this is the
[32:57.340 --> 33:09.420]  battle for the republic happening now you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:09.420 --> 33:15.180]  this is the
[33:24.220 --> 33:25.180]  this is the
[33:27.100 --> 33:29.980]  my only friend the
[33:29.980 --> 33:42.940]  end of our elaborate plans the end of everything that stands the end no safety
[33:43.900 --> 33:54.780]  no safety no surprise the end i'll never i'll never look into your eyes
[33:54.780 --> 34:03.900]  okay did you really think that we could abort 63 million babies
[34:05.820 --> 34:10.460]  and fund the communist china needs to go 400 million other babies most of the little girls
[34:10.460 --> 34:17.900]  and have human animal hybrids and just all the toxic waste dumping and all the corruption and all
[34:17.900 --> 34:27.580]  the pedophilia and everything else that is going on do you really think that god wouldn't allow
[34:27.580 --> 34:32.940]  evil to come after us because that's how god judges you he just lifts the hedge the shields go down
[34:32.940 --> 34:37.820]  and evil can then attack you it always happens we're going into judgment just like israel did
[34:37.820 --> 34:43.900]  when they became corrupt and turned away from god and the prosperity and the freedom and all the
[34:43.900 --> 34:53.660]  decadence we've had is going to be swept away now america is running like a cowered dog into a ditch
[34:53.660 --> 35:02.940]  over the edge of the cliff nobody cares about all those babies they're killing nobody cares about
[35:05.180 --> 35:10.940]  all the Alzheimer's patients exploding let's go ahead and go to this clip of the governor
[35:10.940 --> 35:13.740]  californian
[35:16.460 --> 35:21.820]  saying i don't need martial law it's the settling smiles the reporter
[35:23.340 --> 35:25.820]  because i'll just arrest you if you leave your house
[35:28.380 --> 35:31.340]  arbitrarily that's martial law that's the definition in black's law
[35:33.900 --> 35:36.220]  you see they never name it and call it what it is
[35:36.220 --> 35:42.700]  here let's go ahead and hear from the american psycho
[35:44.780 --> 35:51.340]  you haven't knew some further we have absolute expectation this will be socialized in real
[35:51.340 --> 35:56.620]  time we've had the privilege of talking to many many mayors today and county leaders
[35:56.620 --> 36:01.900]  that are hopeful we were moving in this direction and i have all the confidence in the world these
[36:01.900 --> 36:09.260]  guidance along the same lines that we advanced on large gatherings will take shape the governor of
[36:09.260 --> 36:15.260]  illinois and ohio ordered the closure yeah we could do that easily why not exercise your
[36:15.820 --> 36:21.500]  because we it's a it's a nuance and distinction we get caught up in because to date we haven't
[36:21.500 --> 36:25.820]  needed to do that we've set out guidance those guidance that guidance has been met in every
[36:25.820 --> 36:31.100]  circumstance and as i said in the past if you want to establish a framework of martial law
[36:31.100 --> 36:37.420]  law which is ultimate authority and enforcement we have the capacity to do that but we are not
[36:37.420 --> 36:43.820]  at this moment feeling that is a necessity and to the extent that people do not socialize
[36:43.820 --> 36:48.940]  and support this very directive guidance i would be surprised and we have all the confidence it
[36:48.940 --> 36:57.260]  will be i'll repeat we have this exact conversation with many of you that's enough go back to
[36:57.260 --> 37:01.660]  more just a moment uh the san Antonio mayor was on tv last night i got a bunch of calls about it
[37:02.620 --> 37:10.460]  saying six months in jail if you're caught in a group of ten or more people
[37:13.980 --> 37:19.100]  but if you're a legal alien or a homeless person or someone in a jail for a crime you go free
[37:19.820 --> 37:24.140]  because it's about you learning to do what you're told
[37:24.140 --> 37:28.460]  i want to open the phones up specifically
[37:31.260 --> 37:37.740]  for law enforcement i want to open the phones up specifically
[37:41.420 --> 37:48.460]  for military i want to open the phones up specifically for folks to talk about what you've
[37:48.460 --> 37:51.420]  been told and what you've been told to gear up for but they've already announced that they're
[37:51.420 --> 37:55.340]  putting the military over key distribution sites they're preparing to control state lines
[37:55.340 --> 38:00.620]  preparing to shut down quote all non-essential travel within the united states then you've got to
[38:00.620 --> 38:07.660]  go register with the government to go through a health check to be able to even travel this is
[38:07.660 --> 38:17.580]  martial law to the next level now there's a bunch of articles out about how hiv drugs
[38:17.580 --> 38:23.020]  aren't working though they thought they would because it's got the part of the hiv virus
[38:23.020 --> 38:27.260]  senate it's man made that's admitted and how all these other things aren't working and then we
[38:27.260 --> 38:36.540]  heard a few weeks ago that chloroquine a inexpensive malaria drug is having incredible effects on
[38:36.540 --> 38:42.700]  people if it's caught before it gets too late even if you're old and i've got a bunch of
[38:42.700 --> 38:50.780]  articles and studies and reports here on that but anybody can pull up chloroquine c-h-l-o-r-a
[38:50.780 --> 39:00.540]  q-u-i-n but you know how chloroquine works right french study finds anti-malaria drug chloroquine
[39:00.540 --> 39:06.460]  may be highly effective against coronavirus that was days ago but again it came out weeks ago well
[39:06.460 --> 39:19.500]  guess what chloroquine does according to the literature it pushes zinc into the cells and
[39:19.500 --> 39:28.460]  then when there's zinc in there the viruses can't replicate in the cells isn't that interesting
[39:28.460 --> 39:37.180]  just like nano silver in pentagon reports and countless other homeland security congressional
[39:37.180 --> 39:45.580]  reports coats the cell so that viruses can't get in and it also fries them because it's electrochemical
[39:45.580 --> 39:51.820]  it's conductive just like copper by the way those on the news saying that silver uh
[39:51.820 --> 39:59.820]  saying silver's a cure i'm saying it's established by the army and the civil war they used it and
[39:59.820 --> 40:04.300]  the pentagon uses it now and you go to hospitals to visit family they're everywhere they don't spray
[40:04.300 --> 40:08.700]  the iodine that much even more even though it kills stuff too or the alcohol that's not even
[40:08.700 --> 40:16.140]  hardly used stuff everybody's hand sanitizer they are using nano silver from american
[40:16.140 --> 40:22.860]  biotech labs the one that we use but the toothpaste is sold out folks and i'm not advertising it as
[40:22.860 --> 40:27.260]  something that is a treatment or a defense it's it's sold as a tooth whitening toothpaste but
[40:27.260 --> 40:34.860]  yeah silver's antibacterial antiviral that's what i brush my teeth went but when you hear our
[40:34.860 --> 40:38.380]  advertisements for it that's you up the one minute ad i never played it last week that we run all the
[40:38.380 --> 40:42.860]  time even though it's sold out of the super silver ad it's just it's about whitening your teeth it's
[40:42.860 --> 40:47.900]  not about coronavirus but the media misrepresented that's what i was saying i was reading military
[40:47.900 --> 40:53.820]  reports about this particular nano silver when you go back to the kings in rome and babelon
[40:53.820 --> 41:01.260]  they demanded to only eat off silver platters and to drink out of silver talus is not gold silver
[41:03.820 --> 41:09.340]  going west the uh i'm already digressing i want to get to the news they would put in the
[41:09.340 --> 41:13.180]  buttermilk to keep it longer on the wagon trains a couple silver dollars they didn't know why they
[41:13.180 --> 41:19.740]  just didn't make it last longer well guess what has a whole bunch of zinc in it the real red pill
[41:19.740 --> 41:25.900]  and the real red pill plus the real red pill plus is natural healthy stimulant in it real red pill
[41:25.900 --> 41:32.940]  is the same just no stimulant it has multivitamin minerals amino acids and a big dose of high
[41:32.940 --> 41:43.260]  quality zinc by the way you should also look up zinc and what zinc does for your colon just so
[41:43.260 --> 41:47.740]  happens in all these big major studies they came and debated that people that take a lot of zinc well
[41:49.660 --> 41:54.460]  it's it's a whole other world from the people that don't when it comes to colon cancer but again
[41:54.460 --> 41:59.020]  the system tells you go out and eat comfort food there's actual article go eat lots of sugar party
[41:59.020 --> 42:03.500]  drink a bunch no that's how you die better stop drinking better cut back on the sugar if you're
[42:03.500 --> 42:08.460]  really worried about this virus but my point is real red pill and real red pill plus zinc is sold
[42:08.460 --> 42:14.300]  out everywhere so is vitamin c it's sold out everywhere in fact i have reporters out right
[42:14.300 --> 42:18.620]  now showing multiple stores you're gonna report on it they're just it's empty folks are getting it
[42:19.260 --> 42:23.820]  well guess what we've got in stock and i decided i haven't made this announcement yet i just decided
[42:23.820 --> 42:30.700]  to do it even though this is going to sell out in just a few weeks right now it's only 20 off as we
[42:30.700 --> 42:37.500]  speak it's 50 off i do the opposite of what the globalists do i don't raise prices in a crisis i
[42:37.500 --> 42:42.540]  lower them it's 20 off right now i said i wouldn't do 50 off in the new year i haven't done it yet
[42:43.100 --> 42:48.300]  but i'm doing it now 50 off on real red pill 50 off on real red pill plus because i want you to not
[42:48.300 --> 42:55.100]  procrastinate and i want you to get it has the preglonone as well you need to get this now especially
[42:55.100 --> 43:01.740]  if you are over 20 years old get it today ladies and gentlemen alex jones here with a public
[43:01.740 --> 43:09.340]  service announcement info wars as of today is now suspending storeable food sales we still have
[43:09.340 --> 43:13.500]  storeable food we're able to package all the storeable food and get it to everybody that ordered
[43:13.500 --> 43:18.380]  it most of you've already gotten your food but the reason i'm making this announcement is all the
[43:18.380 --> 43:24.140]  other major food suppliers were sold out over a month ago as we first reported to you but they
[43:24.140 --> 43:29.500]  lied to you and they took your money well we know for the fact they're still taking everybody's money
[43:29.500 --> 43:36.060]  even though the food has all been sold out the basic ingredients for storeable food is gone
[43:36.060 --> 43:42.460]  all the big box stores are paying way over normal prices to buy up what's left and so anybody telling
[43:42.460 --> 43:48.460]  you that they have storeable food is lying to you the good news is everyone that ordered an info
[43:48.460 --> 43:53.100]  or store.com has already gotten it or if you ordered recently we have the food is being packaged
[43:53.100 --> 43:59.420]  and you will get it but as of now we are suspending all new food sales and info or store.com the
[43:59.420 --> 44:05.180]  talking points are all the same everything is choreographed by the western media and every
[44:05.180 --> 44:11.900]  authoritarian regime on the planet that lust ever power and control their globalist system has been
[44:11.900 --> 44:18.460]  challenged humanity has awoken to them and so they use the man-made virus to create themes
[44:18.460 --> 44:24.860]  out of a science fiction dystopian novel to scare the population into submission and then they
[44:24.860 --> 44:33.500]  launch their global corporate strike against the western world and against the average person
[44:33.500 --> 44:40.060]  and the average saver the average homeowner the average small business owner that's why the big
[44:40.060 --> 44:45.820]  mega corporations are exempt and they all get to stay open the mom and pops all have to close
[44:45.820 --> 44:52.780]  according to them it's a corporate strike against we the people it's a corporate strike the Wuhan
[44:52.780 --> 44:57.340]  virus and the whole operation is a globalist corporate strike against the nation state and
[44:57.340 --> 45:04.300]  individuals one of the products that i'm very proud of i don't talk enough about because

[46:01.260 --> 46:08.060]  the chai comms and democrats that they control that have been pushing for coronavirus hysteria
[46:08.780 --> 46:17.660]  and suspension of basic rights for the last eight weeks and now governor newson has come out publicly
[46:18.300 --> 46:25.740]  and said they're ready to declare martial law well that's a word game when you tell 40 million
[46:25.740 --> 46:32.380]  people they can't leave their houses period and you scare monger and say that almost 60% of the
[46:32.380 --> 46:39.420]  population will have it in just six weeks you're engaged in psychological warfare and you've already
[46:39.420 --> 46:47.180]  declared martial law about a seven on a one to ten Richter scale get ready folks the democrats
[46:47.180 --> 46:54.540]  just like the chai comms are setting the bar for martial law full on secret arrest FEMA camps you
[46:54.540 --> 47:10.460]  name it but the homeless and illegal aliens are all exempt you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:10.460 --> 47:24.940]  leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order it's alex jones
[47:30.380 --> 47:35.100]  the way to get them to not implement full martial law and keep it in place 18 months that will
[47:35.100 --> 47:39.100]  guarantee the greatest oppression we've ever seen all their countries will be open for business will
[47:39.100 --> 47:43.180]  just be totally locked down starving to death and the media will be saying you know trump's been
[47:43.180 --> 47:48.700]  removed and whenever you never leave your homes again i mean that's their plan they want to
[47:48.700 --> 47:55.580]  conquer america the big corporations with the globalist this is 21st century war it's psychological
[47:55.580 --> 48:04.060]  warfare the pentagon will tell you 90 of war is psychological and we are absolutely being scared
[48:04.060 --> 48:08.540]  to death trump said the hype is a hoax gather virus is going to kill some people it's been this
[48:08.540 --> 48:14.700]  way since the beginning of time plagues come and go we're working on treatments but when the media
[48:14.700 --> 48:20.940]  says when the un says like it's the authority the world health organization says there is no
[48:20.940 --> 48:27.580]  treatment and there is no vaccine there's nothing you can do and people are like well wait a minute
[48:28.940 --> 48:34.380]  chloroquine the antiviral drug they're seeing all over these studies really works well and what's
[48:34.380 --> 48:42.060]  it do it pushes zinc in to the cells doesn't mean it will 100 protect you but it's a big deal so does
[48:42.060 --> 48:47.820]  vitamin c there's no bell prizes for vitamin c stopping viruses and infections two of them
[48:47.820 --> 48:54.700]  line is pulling well the world health organization says that just doesn't matter and again ladies and
[48:54.700 --> 49:02.220]  gentlemen they're not on the news telling you get zinc get vitamin c they're not telling you the
[49:02.220 --> 49:07.660]  studies about iodine massively boosting your immunity they're not telling you about nano silver
[49:07.660 --> 49:13.980]  they're not telling you anything i've got articles going people are enjoying more alcohol and comfort
[49:13.980 --> 49:19.660]  food and watching tv and there's watching so much tv that the bandwidth in europe isn't high enough so
[49:19.660 --> 49:26.300]  that you ordered netflix and youtube to cut the bandwidth quality from hd that's martial law
[49:26.300 --> 49:31.740]  law when the government's controlling how much electricity you get and how much bandwidth you get
[49:32.460 --> 49:38.780]  whether you paid for or not it's every level it's called fascism when the government controls
[49:38.780 --> 49:43.740]  what the corporations do and then gives all the profits to them you get socialism and the crumbs
[49:43.740 --> 49:49.820]  down here you get a communist style enforcement but it's fascist flying above you in their jet
[49:49.820 --> 50:00.380]  copters and lear jets and gulfstream jets and jumbo jets so it's just incredible to me that we've
[50:00.380 --> 50:08.300]  reached this point and now we learn republican and democrats including dianne feinstein just a
[50:08.300 --> 50:16.540]  chinese spy runner up office got a classified briefing on coronavirus and how dire it was
[50:16.540 --> 50:23.660]  same intelligence agency saying trumps are russian agent trump still hadn't gotten rid of all the
[50:23.660 --> 50:33.020]  globalist and they dumped their stock and the media strangely enough is calling for the republicans
[50:33.020 --> 50:42.460]  to resign but not the democrats i say every damn one of them i don't care if a republican or a
[50:42.460 --> 50:48.540]  democrat you get a classified briefing and you go dump your stock it's called insider trading
[50:49.900 --> 50:52.140]  stick a fork in them they're done but see oh
[50:55.180 --> 50:59.260]  don't you know those few republicans that didn't vote for impeachment don't you know now when
[50:59.260 --> 51:02.620]  there's going to be a new impeachment coming up oh you know it's coming for not handling the
[51:02.620 --> 51:07.740]  coronavirus right give it four months when the death's peaking hundreds of thousands
[51:07.740 --> 51:14.780]  on the high end 50 000 low end that's my prediction from the real numbers
[51:16.780 --> 51:22.540]  that oh they've got their votes now because those are because the fbi is still controlled by the
[51:22.540 --> 51:29.260]  globalist at the top and they all defer prosecution for insider trading but you're gonna now vote
[51:29.260 --> 51:35.900]  against president trump so you can see how all this is coming together meanwhile big article
[51:35.900 --> 51:41.020]  on info wars.com with links to the wall street journal migrant labor was to blame for coronavirus
[51:41.020 --> 51:50.220]  spread in both idli and iran and the cdc allowed more than 200 flights of repatriated americans
[51:50.220 --> 51:58.620]  including those they knew had corona and let them go in towns all over america and san antonio made
[51:58.620 --> 52:05.420]  a big deal about it said don't do it remember but they still did and now anthony fouchy and all the
[52:05.420 --> 52:11.980]  same ones that run the show they're the good guys and trump gets up and tries to talk the virus down
[52:11.980 --> 52:18.540]  fouchy saddles up saddles up and says it's all over run with the hills you're all dead
[52:20.140 --> 52:25.980]  trumps always surrounded by the deep state you say why does he appoint them that's who was there
[52:25.980 --> 52:30.620]  that's who's been there it's every agency and they've got their minions five six seven eight nine
[52:30.620 --> 52:42.060]  ten below them and then lie to the president's face oh my gosh so she may newgent is joining us to
[52:42.060 --> 52:47.980]  talk about living off the grid and she's written books about it and her view on a lot of things as
[52:47.980 --> 52:55.500]  she said she's uh not pulling punches anymore she's very bold uh and is ready to go on air and she's
[52:55.500 --> 53:00.700]  a really interesting smart lady to tell newgent's wife and i really look forward to her joining us
[53:00.700 --> 53:07.260]  the next hour and then this is what's going to happen i'm going to open the phones up in the
[53:07.260 --> 53:11.260]  third and fourth hour mike adams is going to be riding shotgun with me in the fourth hour
[53:12.060 --> 53:16.300]  we're going to be covering the waterfront and i want to be clear because some people try to say
[53:16.300 --> 53:21.020]  that you know mike adams and i are fighting over stuff we're not might spend right this was hyped up
[53:21.020 --> 53:26.700]  it's a man-made virus we've covered that as well we've been tacking together on that and other
[53:26.700 --> 53:30.380]  experts we've had on been together and we can tell this is going to be huge going to be dangerous
[53:30.380 --> 53:37.580]  the virus is man-made it is killing people but the disproportionate media hype saying trump did bad
[53:37.580 --> 53:42.300]  and trying to shut down our market because our market isn't as controlled as china's and because
[53:42.300 --> 53:47.900]  our media is going to be anti-trump instead of being pro gg ping like they were this is really
[53:47.900 --> 53:52.380]  going to destroy confidence and and cause a depression and you've got all these globalist
[53:52.380 --> 54:00.780]  cheerleaders on television hyping the fall of the economy foaming at the mouth and so this is their
[54:00.780 --> 54:05.980]  move if you wonder what they would do next this is it and we we rightfully said trump you better
[54:05.980 --> 54:09.820]  get ahead of it at least rhetoric wise are they're going to say you didn't respond right
[54:11.980 --> 54:16.300]  and i was thinking steps ahead but then as you actually see it unfold you're like gosh you're
[54:16.300 --> 54:22.460]  damned if you do you're damned if you don't between a rock and a hard place and so in the
[54:22.460 --> 54:30.940]  third and fourth hour i want to hear from military from first responders from fire departments from
[54:30.940 --> 54:37.020]  emergency management uh from all sorts of folks because this type of stuff is going around we're
[54:37.020 --> 54:40.860]  already under martial law by the democrats and areas they control they already set the precedent
[54:40.860 --> 54:47.020]  to make it look like trump didn't act if he doesn't but this is the stuff going around in text messages
[54:47.020 --> 54:51.260]  everywhere i got it from the federalist society directly in the meeting last sunday with trump
[54:51.260 --> 54:55.740]  when he was about to come out and announce interstate travel bans but did and we said he may do it he
[54:55.740 --> 55:00.540]  may not the best time to do it is sunday night that way there's not a lot of traffic stuff going
[55:00.540 --> 55:04.860]  on you can get it in place and then try to block people going across state lines and it's going to
[55:04.860 --> 55:10.300]  be a disaster and the lockdowns it's just gonna be out of control but this is the stuff going around
[55:10.300 --> 55:14.700]  some of these are fake some of these are real but everybody loves stuff that's nebulous like an
[55:14.700 --> 55:19.100]  easter egg hunt like the q stuff you know something can be the governor saying well we're looking at
[55:19.100 --> 55:23.740]  martial law but don't leave your homes that is martial law that's kind of oh who cares about
[55:23.740 --> 55:29.100]  something real and totally bombshell let's just talk about text messages we got dad works for
[55:29.100 --> 55:34.540]  homeland security he said that they're prepping to mobilize the national guard preparing to dispatch
[55:34.540 --> 55:38.940]  them across the us along the military next they will call in first responders he said they're
[55:38.940 --> 55:43.500]  preparing to announce a nationwide one-week quarantine for all citizens and businesses closed
[55:43.500 --> 55:47.660]  everyone at home they are told to pack and be prepared for up to 30 days deployment which he
[55:47.660 --> 55:52.540]  said means they may extend the quarantine up to 30 days oh it's going to go after that he told me
[55:52.540 --> 55:56.780]  to notify our family members and have them stock up and be prepared they will announce this as soon
[55:56.780 --> 56:01.740]  as they have trips in place to help prevent looters and rioters he said he got the call last night
[56:01.740 --> 56:06.220]  and was told to pack and be prepared for the call today when the dispatch orders he said we'll
[56:06.220 --> 56:12.380]  announce before the end of the weekend to keep people home on monday there's hundreds of versions
[56:12.380 --> 56:17.740]  of these being put out by shadowy groups that are spamming them and i think it's think tanks of the
[56:17.740 --> 56:22.460]  democrats just pushing the perception so that trump feels like he has to do it and so the public
[56:22.460 --> 56:28.380]  acquiesces to it because when you track most of these they don't go back to real people meanwhile
[56:28.380 --> 56:32.860]  they're getting the troops ready to take over and put setting up checkpoints and i've seen police
[56:32.860 --> 56:37.660]  doing drills and fire departments with dump trucks getting ready to block roads all over texas
[56:38.540 --> 56:42.060]  so they're declaring an emergency they're saying don't leave your home and let's have
[56:42.060 --> 56:45.660]  the critical stuff they're saying close all the businesses now they're talking about closing them

[59:59.180 --> 1:00:03.500]  the way to stop the globalist is to expose that they're behind it but if they can pose as the
[1:00:03.500 --> 1:00:07.980]  saviors they're going to bring the country down their heads politically must roll
[1:00:08.700 --> 1:00:14.140]  it's gonna be the chinese century come hell or high water and it couldn't have been telegraphed
[1:00:14.140 --> 1:00:19.340]  any clearer one woman said i want a recession because that'll help get rid of donald trump and
[1:00:19.340 --> 1:00:24.540]  that i think that's most liberals won't admit that one way you get rid of trump is a crashing
[1:00:24.540 --> 1:00:30.780]  economy so please bring on the recession here we are facing the threat of an 18 month shutdown
[1:00:30.780 --> 1:00:36.060]  which would fuel an unemployment rate that could make the great depression look like a walk in the
[1:00:36.060 --> 1:00:41.340]  park okay so look at airline industry auto industry restaurant industry hotel industry
[1:00:42.940 --> 1:00:50.700]  you know capitalism does not work in an 18 month shutdown capitalism can work in a 30 day
[1:00:50.700 --> 1:00:57.820]  shutdown and to not stop the buyback programs the husband resources to call the pull down draw
[1:00:57.820 --> 1:01:04.300]  down the credit lines because hell is coming regardless of our convoluted global situation
[1:01:04.300 --> 1:01:10.540]  the chinese just turned their economic engine back on while the world chokes on a silent wave of
[1:01:10.540 --> 1:01:17.020]  their communist propaganda filtered through american think tanks and eventually the mockingbird media
[1:01:17.020 --> 1:01:25.500]  did this virus originate in china yes but mr president that does not excuse your weeks and
[1:01:25.500 --> 1:01:30.540]  weeks of tweeting lies and misinformation about the virus while the leaders of other nations
[1:01:30.540 --> 1:01:37.500]  were taking steps to make sure their populations could be safe consider the term chinese food racist
[1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:42.940]  because it's food that originates in china or it has no i don't think it's racist i don't think
[1:01:42.940 --> 1:01:48.540]  it's racist at all it amazes me when i read the things that i read it amazes me when i read the
[1:01:48.540 --> 1:01:53.900]  world street journal which is always so negative uh it amazes me when i read the new york times
[1:01:53.900 --> 1:01:57.980]  is not even i don't i barely read it you know we don't distribute it in the white house anymore
[1:01:57.980 --> 1:02:05.580]  in the same thing with the washington post they use different slogans and different concepts for me
[1:02:05.580 --> 1:02:11.180]  almost every week trying to catch something last week it was all chaos you see me there's no chaos
[1:02:11.180 --> 1:02:16.300]  i had no chaos i'm the one telling everybody to be calm forcing freedom to come to a temporary
[1:02:16.300 --> 1:02:22.860]  standstill in the wake of the chinese stranglehold on the availability of basic common medicine
[1:02:22.860 --> 1:02:29.660]  even the medicines to care for people who are hospitalized with coronavirus 90 of those ingredients
[1:02:29.660 --> 1:02:35.900]  come from china once we opened up pre-trade that's when we lost our last aspirin plant
[1:02:35.900 --> 1:02:41.420]  in 2002 so we can't make aspirin in the united states that's when we lost our last penicillin
[1:02:41.420 --> 1:02:48.540]  plant which closed in 2004 the same time we lost our ability to make vitamin c these are basic things
[1:02:48.540 --> 1:02:53.260]  we need for life this is about survivability so we have to bring that manufacturing back home
[1:02:53.260 --> 1:02:59.980]  to this country and while the silent majority is away the dc rats will play now those that would
[1:02:59.980 --> 1:03:06.780]  never waste a crisis are beginning to rear their ugly heads as opensecrets.org reported as the
[1:03:06.780 --> 1:03:12.380]  coronavirus outbreak began to spread across the us in mid february senate intelligence committee
[1:03:12.380 --> 1:03:17.340]  chairman richard burr unloaded his holdings and dozens of stocks that would lose much of their
[1:03:17.340 --> 1:03:23.340]  market value over the coming weeks around the time that burr sold his shares of major corporations
[1:03:23.340 --> 1:03:28.780]  including several hard-hit hotel companies he publicly expressed confidence about the us
[1:03:28.780 --> 1:03:34.380]  government's ability to fight the virus however in late february burr privately warned that the
[1:03:34.380 --> 1:03:39.980]  virus is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history
[1:03:39.980 --> 1:03:45.340]  and as bright part reported senator lindsay graham is using the coronavirus recovery bills to
[1:03:45.340 --> 1:03:51.980]  dramatically expand the award of eb5 green cards to wealthy chinese if they lend money to us real
[1:03:51.980 --> 1:03:57.100]  estate investors and other companies a proposal which could be included in one of the senate's
[1:03:57.100 --> 1:04:02.940]  coronavirus rescue bills would significantly boost the number of visas offered annually from
[1:04:02.940 --> 1:04:10.220]  10 000 to 75 000 while cutting in half the investment required to earn legal residents from 900 000
[1:04:10.220 --> 1:04:17.420]  to 450 000 they say half the recipients of the eb5 visa program investors and their families
[1:04:17.420 --> 1:04:22.860]  come from china according to a report by the brookings institution think tank and while
[1:04:22.860 --> 1:04:29.100]  america is distracted adam schiff is performing cpr on three crooked faiza provisions that
[1:04:29.100 --> 1:04:34.220]  lapsed as the washington times reports attempts to rein in the government's ability to spy on
[1:04:34.220 --> 1:04:40.620]  americans fell flat after representative adam b schiff intervened to protect the types of powers
[1:04:40.620 --> 1:04:48.220]  that the fbi used to go after the trump campaign in 2016 the longer this goes on the more the veil
[1:04:48.220 --> 1:04:54.540]  will be lifted on the disgusting face of corruption and a coordinated globalist siege of a once
[1:04:54.540 --> 1:05:01.420]  thriving united states john bound reporting the noose is tightening around america's neck the
[1:05:01.420 --> 1:05:07.500]  supply chains have been cut off we are under globalist attack and president trump understands this

[1:06:16.380 --> 1:06:19.740]  we're going to an amazing lady here in just a moment for the rest of the hour
[1:06:20.380 --> 1:06:25.260]  shamane newton said newton's wife and most you know who she is from the tv shows the books and
[1:06:25.260 --> 1:06:29.820]  more she's got a lot to say about the coronavirus living off the grid how to not go crazy during
[1:06:29.820 --> 1:06:34.380]  this time and more but first here's the governor of california who said he wanted to trigger this
[1:06:34.380 --> 1:06:41.260]  nationwide declaring martial law but not calling it martial law saying 40 million people must stay
[1:06:41.260 --> 1:06:48.220]  in their homes here he is last night further we have absolute expectation uh this will be
[1:06:48.220 --> 1:06:53.580]  socialized in real time we've had the privilege of talking to many many mayors today and county
[1:06:53.580 --> 1:06:58.940]  leaders that are hopeful we were moving in this direction and i have all the confidence in the
[1:06:58.940 --> 1:07:06.220]  world these guidance along the same lines that we advanced on large gatherings will take shape
[1:07:06.220 --> 1:07:12.540]  the governor of illinois and ohio ordered the closure yeah we could do that easily why not
[1:07:12.540 --> 1:07:18.860]  exercise your because we it's a it's a nuance and distinction we get caught up in because to date we
[1:07:18.860 --> 1:07:23.660]  haven't needed to do that we've set out guidance those guidance that guidance has been met in every
[1:07:23.660 --> 1:07:29.500]  circumstance and as i said in the past if you want to establish a framework of martial law
[1:07:29.500 --> 1:07:35.260]  which is ultimate authority and enforcement we have the capacity to do that but we are not at
[1:07:35.260 --> 1:07:41.660]  this moment feeling that is a necessity and to the extent uh that people do not socialize
[1:07:41.660 --> 1:07:46.700]  and support this very direct of guidance uh i would be surprised and we have all the confidence
[1:07:46.700 --> 1:07:55.580]  it will be uh i'll repeat we had this exact conversation with many of you uh as well last
[1:07:55.580 --> 1:08:02.300]  week when we put out the guidelines as it relates to non-essential events you saw in every part of
[1:08:02.300 --> 1:08:07.340]  this state those guidelines were followed i have all the expectation in the world the guidelines
[1:08:07.340 --> 1:08:13.500]  will be followed on this the same thing that i said then i'll repeat what i just told phil just
[1:08:13.500 --> 1:08:19.260]  put you into a stranglehold he puts you into martial law to try to push trump into that or
[1:08:19.260 --> 1:08:23.500]  trump hasn't acted they're saying he follows the chai kong model that he says oh but it's not a
[1:08:23.500 --> 1:08:31.100]  stranglehold it's a subtle nuance as you heard him just say as they burn down the u.s economy well

[1:09:34.300 --> 1:09:40.620]  reserved in public i get it but hit him with both barrels you've got the floor well number one i have
[1:09:40.620 --> 1:09:47.820]  to thank all of our healthcare workers who are on the front lines of this war right now um we owe
[1:09:47.820 --> 1:09:53.100]  our lives to them thank you so much for doing what you're doing for putting your lives at risk
[1:09:53.100 --> 1:09:58.220]  and for taking care of us i mean this is scary and you've talked about the coronavirus and what's
[1:09:58.220 --> 1:10:05.740]  going on and i started to do some research uh in the past month or so and i started to find out what
[1:10:05.740 --> 1:10:12.380]  what's really going on and it scared the crap out of me and i just felt that i needed to share this
[1:10:12.380 --> 1:10:19.260]  with my followers i mean i say that i'm an unlikely interpreter and messenger for what's going on but
[1:10:19.260 --> 1:10:26.140]  i've had so many people wake up and my followers and do their own research that's what i encourage
[1:10:26.140 --> 1:10:30.940]  well i respect you as a researcher i learned a lot from you on the medical field you're on the
[1:10:30.940 --> 1:10:34.940]  nutrition side of me you're really a respected expert on that from your deep research what do
[1:10:34.940 --> 1:10:38.940]  you really think this virus is where do you think it's coming from what do you think is going to
[1:10:38.940 --> 1:10:45.820]  happen well nobody knows for sure of there i'm sure there's a handful of people who do know
[1:10:45.820 --> 1:10:50.620]  but those of us who are civilians don't really know exactly how it's all going to pan out but
[1:10:50.620 --> 1:10:55.660]  i want to ask you a question and your listeners your your viewers a question do you really think
[1:10:55.660 --> 1:11:00.780]  this is about the coronavirus do you really think that we're being sequestered for the
[1:11:00.780 --> 1:11:07.020]  coronavirus and what else is there and i have encouraged all of my followers to do their own
[1:11:07.020 --> 1:11:12.540]  research and i started to become bold and brave and you know what alex i got to tell you there's
[1:11:12.540 --> 1:11:20.460]  never been a time where i wasn't more proud to be a hunter and more proud to be a hunter
[1:11:20.460 --> 1:11:25.900]  and more proud that Ted and i haven't altered our lifestyle at all we just don't go into town but
[1:11:25.900 --> 1:11:31.660]  we live off the land anyway and we're totally self-sufficient so this really hasn't affected us in
[1:11:31.660 --> 1:11:37.900]  fact i get to talk to people like you more often well i've been out to your texas place and it is
[1:11:37.900 --> 1:11:41.980]  a little piece of heaven and it's it's very simple as well you've got your house up there on that
[1:11:41.980 --> 1:11:45.420]  side of the ridge and you know people will think you guys have a big mansion or something and you
[1:11:45.420 --> 1:11:50.540]  know i mean you guys have an awesome little little cottage that you would imagine snow white lives in
[1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:56.780]  except there's about a hundred guys only a hundred you think a hundred that i can see
[1:11:58.460 --> 1:12:04.300]  yeah that's right um yeah we've always been self-sufficient and it's really important i think
[1:12:04.300 --> 1:12:13.260]  you know since ted and i got married uh 31 years ago i learned firsthand the uh opportunity to have
[1:12:13.260 --> 1:12:19.100]  to take care of myself for my family and remember the y2k fears that's when i first started getting
[1:12:19.100 --> 1:12:27.500]  into hunting and becoming a responsible gun owner and take not taking it for granted my safety i
[1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:34.220]  started getting death threats and i started carrying and i never take my a day of my life for granted
[1:12:34.220 --> 1:12:39.900]  and you know one of the reasons that i'm on this mission is because i got sick and almost died
[1:12:39.900 --> 1:12:45.500]  from toxic mold exposure between the walls of my home that was once featured on mtv cribs
[1:12:45.500 --> 1:12:49.980]  we didn't know what was going on with us and and ted and i and our son rocko just kept getting
[1:12:49.980 --> 1:12:57.100]  sicker and sicker and i had preemphyzema which is why i've been staying home more often anyway
[1:12:57.820 --> 1:13:04.060]  and i i became my own investigative sleuth and found out that both ted and i had four different
[1:13:04.060 --> 1:13:11.180]  types of mold in our bloodstream i was diagnosed with preemphyzema and i don't smoke and our son
[1:13:11.180 --> 1:13:18.140]  rocko had severe asthma so i had to make a shift i think once you get backed into a corner nobody
[1:13:18.140 --> 1:13:25.100]  puts baby in a corner right once you get pushed into a corner you come out fighting and right now
[1:13:25.100 --> 1:13:29.740]  we've got to fight for our health we've got to fight for our lives and i don't mean to scare
[1:13:29.740 --> 1:13:36.220]  anybody i want to replace the um and and stress that it's not about scaring it's about being
[1:13:36.220 --> 1:13:41.580]  responsible but if there's ever a time when america needs to step up it's now
[1:13:44.700 --> 1:13:49.340]  i'm just sitting here listening to you i want to get into a whole bunch of areas
[1:13:49.980 --> 1:13:54.300]  with you but but tell us what you really think because i don't want to believe
[1:13:54.300 --> 1:14:00.140]  uh that trump isn't making progress against the deep state but then i don't want to believe
[1:14:00.140 --> 1:14:05.260]  that there's just this huge thing secretly going on where everything's being handled but then i do
[1:14:05.260 --> 1:14:10.380]  see the head of harvard science caught as a chicon agent i do see all these top people being arrested
[1:14:10.380 --> 1:14:15.500]  as pedophiles i do see the deep state getting rolled up and now we're learning that hillary server
[1:14:16.060 --> 1:14:21.420]  is in the hands of the nypd and is going to be coming out soon uh so it does look like that that
[1:14:21.420 --> 1:14:25.900]  trump is on the move but he was already on the move before this virus popped up so i see them
[1:14:25.900 --> 1:14:30.460]  trying to use the virus against trump saying it's his fault but at the same time it's also an
[1:14:30.460 --> 1:14:34.860]  opportunity for trump to mop up the deep state so i think both sides are trying to use it right
[1:14:34.860 --> 1:14:41.420]  now what do you think yeah i totally agree but i think trump is one step ahead of him and obviously
[1:14:41.420 --> 1:14:51.180]  this is a uh a pre-ordained um evolution this is unlike anything we've ever experienced before
[1:14:51.180 --> 1:14:57.260]  to biblical proportions and it's all had to unravel the way that it's unraveled i think
[1:14:57.260 --> 1:15:02.220]  that we're going to start seeing more of the president helping people i think there's going
[1:15:02.220 --> 1:15:08.060]  to be a takeover rather than bailing out the banks we're bailing out the people and that's the way
[1:15:08.060 --> 1:15:13.260]  it should be people are going to be sent checks and people are going to taxes are going to be deferred
[1:15:13.260 --> 1:15:19.500]  so oh yeah they just announced that you don't pay income taxes now till uh later in the year in
[1:15:19.500 --> 1:15:25.820]  like july it's crazy it's it it's an exciting time i know what you're trying to get me to say
[1:15:27.980 --> 1:15:36.380]  i do believe that there is an orchestrated group of individuals that some people have called q
[1:15:36.380 --> 1:15:42.540]  who have been dropping breadcrumbs so to speak for those of us and the information is available
[1:15:42.540 --> 1:15:49.420]  online i have told my people to do the research for themselves and to look up q anon and to do

[1:19:08.380 --> 1:19:15.340]  facing a new depression unless trump and the american people work together to develop a plan to
[1:19:15.340 --> 1:19:22.460]  expose this globalist operation that's it people are calling and saying we wish you had the supplements
[1:19:22.460 --> 1:19:28.940]  in stock we wish that wasn't sold out they've confused that with the food everything we advertise

[1:19:56.700 --> 1:20:14.700]  going on you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:14.700 --> 1:20:24.700]  oh
[1:20:25.340 --> 1:20:32.380]  really excited to have her with us and i'm told uh ted might uh pop in but i really am enjoying
[1:20:32.380 --> 1:20:36.460]  talking to her it was always love talking to ted too and get his take on this and i know you guys
[1:20:36.460 --> 1:20:41.500]  pretty much agree maybe disagree a little bit uh you know on the virus overall how serious it is
[1:20:41.500 --> 1:20:47.900]  or if it's really just to cover for something larger but i have said last sunday and i said
[1:20:47.900 --> 1:20:53.100]  start of the show that i believe if they declare nationwide martial law officially that it'll be
[1:20:53.100 --> 1:20:58.060]  done on a sunday night well i'm reading uh the governor of new york's eating but just came out
[1:20:58.700 --> 1:21:06.060]  everything's shut down on sunday night at 8 p.m and so there you go and and that's what
[1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:09.580]  trump was thinking about doing if you want to do it the middle of the week or middle of the
[1:21:09.580 --> 1:21:17.020]  you know giant rush hour you've got to slowly implement it and uh it just shows how crazy the
[1:21:17.020 --> 1:21:23.100]  world is folks we've been predicting this for so long chameleon there's so many topics i want to
[1:21:23.100 --> 1:21:28.860]  get into with you here uh but a big part of what you talk about is how to not go crazy
[1:21:29.580 --> 1:21:33.820]  while you're locked down but i saw the one in guardian demonize myself and james was he rolls
[1:21:33.820 --> 1:21:37.980]  another saying that we've said be preppers for years that just means be self-sufficient answer
[1:21:37.980 --> 1:21:42.540]  self-sufficient grasshoppers aren't uh but but but now i think that shows our credibility is even
[1:21:42.540 --> 1:21:47.100]  greater that we've been prepping that like in the new york times london guardian that we're bad
[1:21:47.100 --> 1:21:50.860]  for being prepared but i know you and ted don't even call it prepping you just call it being
[1:21:50.860 --> 1:21:56.780]  self-sufficient yeah that's right alex um if you don't mind i would like to do something
[1:21:56.780 --> 1:22:03.180]  here with you live that you've probably never done before on your show are you ready yes you
[1:22:03.180 --> 1:22:11.100]  want to try it is it called breathing i want you to take a deep breath and when you breathe in
[1:22:11.100 --> 1:22:13.820]  silently count to four ready do it with me ready
[1:22:19.180 --> 1:22:26.220]  you're not doing it i counted before good good all right that's how i guessed what you were gonna
[1:22:26.220 --> 1:22:34.700]  say great mind you know what you know what alex here's the thing um we don't really know for
[1:22:34.700 --> 1:22:40.220]  sure what's gonna unravel and when and we're all getting breadcrumbs and bits of piece of information
[1:22:40.220 --> 1:22:45.900]  but i woke up a couple of weeks ago with an anxiety attack before this all happened i was in the
[1:22:45.900 --> 1:22:53.100]  hospital and i started thinking this is something's got to change i have to change i each and every
[1:22:53.100 --> 1:22:58.060]  one of us same thing happened to my wife who i know your friends with and talk to she it's
[1:22:58.060 --> 1:23:02.060]  happened her about six weeks because she was having dreams about toilet paper and people having a
[1:23:02.060 --> 1:23:05.660]  huge amount i thought she was crazy but a lot of people a lot of women have been having
[1:23:05.660 --> 1:23:11.580]  premonitions is that what you're talking about yeah and i'm i really believe that right now the only
[1:23:11.580 --> 1:23:17.020]  thing that we can do for sure the only thing that we know for sure is that each and every one of us
[1:23:17.020 --> 1:23:21.020]  has to take care of our health for whatever reason do you want to go to the hospital right now
[1:23:21.020 --> 1:23:26.940]  whether or not you have the coronavirus no take care of yourself i like to this is what i started
[1:23:26.940 --> 1:23:34.780]  doing recently and it's really helped me i shut down i unplug i disconnect from tv from radio from
[1:23:34.780 --> 1:23:40.300]  everything two hours before i go to bed i take a bath i put lavender essential oils in the bath
[1:23:40.300 --> 1:23:46.460]  and i light the candles and i listen to soft music you have to you have to take care of yourself
[1:23:46.460 --> 1:23:50.060]  because you'll wake up in the middle of the night by the way you're right i it looks like i've aged
[1:23:50.060 --> 1:23:53.980]  10 years the last couple months dealing with this and it's true we've got a disconnect we've got to
[1:23:53.980 --> 1:23:58.940]  turn our phones off we've got to we've got to breathe more and and not let this make us have a
[1:23:58.940 --> 1:24:02.940]  heart attack or get divorced or have you know all the stress that it's causing because that's
[1:24:02.940 --> 1:24:08.860]  really the byproduct of it is the stress of all this change so so how do i do that yeah so fear
[1:24:08.860 --> 1:24:16.220]  let's not over react with fear let's be over prepared so prepare your bodies and your mindset
[1:24:16.220 --> 1:24:22.460]  mind body and spirit all are one all are connected if somebody says something to you that you know
[1:24:22.460 --> 1:24:27.820]  hurt your feelings you feel it in your gut so what we need to do right now is do more meditation
[1:24:27.820 --> 1:24:33.900]  exercise i'm going to start to do every other day live video workouts on my instagram and
[1:24:33.900 --> 1:24:38.700]  i'll just be about 10 minutes and you know what 10 minutes can make a huge difference in fact in
[1:24:38.700 --> 1:24:44.620]  my book four minutes could take it make a big difference i talk about little things in my book
[1:24:44.620 --> 1:24:49.260]  well i should have brought that book up i can't wait to read that because it's all right little
[1:24:49.260 --> 1:24:53.420]  things that you can do in four minutes that will change your life and i already talked about this
[1:24:53.420 --> 1:25:00.700]  i wrote this several years ago that you can do go outside while we can and breathe and listen to the
[1:25:00.700 --> 1:25:07.900]  birds and for teddy's got to put his hearing aid in to listen but really listen to the sounds of
[1:25:07.900 --> 1:25:15.020]  mother nature mother nature and let that soothe your soul and ground get grounded in earth and and
[1:25:15.020 --> 1:25:21.020]  really play with your kids play with your dogs spend spend time doing the things that you love to do
[1:25:21.020 --> 1:25:25.980]  but indoors and if you've got kids you might be going a little bit stir crazy trying to figure
[1:25:25.980 --> 1:25:31.340]  out how to entertain them all but this is a great opportunity for us alex this is what we've needed
[1:25:31.340 --> 1:25:39.660]  we've become so disconnected from our families and this is a great shift i think i agree get back
[1:25:39.660 --> 1:25:44.860]  to the book because i actually wanted to bring the book up i want to read it because uh what are
[1:25:44.860 --> 1:25:48.860]  the little tricks you can do but people should read the book but what are the basic things we
[1:25:48.860 --> 1:25:55.340]  can do to just de-stress well i i cover three pillars mind body and spirit because it really
[1:25:55.340 --> 1:25:59.980]  is all connected it's not just a diet book although i do talk about things that you shouldn't eat like
[1:25:59.980 --> 1:26:05.980]  um foods that have been prepared and have all kinds of chemicals in them and put on a shelf for
[1:26:05.980 --> 1:26:11.580]  months or even years get back to the hoof the ground or the tree like we're going to have to
[1:26:12.380 --> 1:26:19.420]  now more than ever and fuel your body with clean wholesome wholesome food but also taking care of
[1:26:19.420 --> 1:26:27.340]  your mindset get right with god as i've heard you say um become more prayer prayerful become more
[1:26:27.340 --> 1:26:33.740]  loving to yourself and to those around you you're right because when i do things because
[1:26:33.740 --> 1:26:37.820]  i hate the globalists it makes me physically not happy but i do it because i love my children
[1:26:37.820 --> 1:26:42.940]  because i love humanity then it's empowering now i've gotten a little bit more healthy over the
[1:26:42.940 --> 1:26:47.180]  years and but but somebody that does eat your advice so i know you know well is the president
[1:26:47.180 --> 1:26:52.300]  we need to tell him he needs to stop the kfc and the mcdonald's man he's got an iron constitution
[1:26:52.300 --> 1:26:59.180]  at his age eating that stuff i know i think there's something else going on um he is he's fueling
[1:26:59.180 --> 1:27:05.100]  himself feeling fueling his body mind and spirit with energy from us energy from the people and i
[1:27:05.100 --> 1:27:10.940]  know for a fact and you probably know this too and i know ted the reason that we keep going the reason
[1:27:10.940 --> 1:27:16.300]  that i keep posting the reason that i've recently spoken out about what i know is because i get so
[1:27:16.300 --> 1:27:22.540]  much positive feedback and i'm sure the president does too that's the fuel for our fire our spiritual
[1:27:22.540 --> 1:27:27.900]  fire that we need right now what i was about to say used to like mainline comment sections of
[1:27:27.900 --> 1:27:33.660]  newspapers or youtube about half the comments supported now it's like 90 on videos attacking
[1:27:33.660 --> 1:27:41.260]  me abc news or cnn it's almost every comment uh and i know for ted and you that you've been
[1:27:41.260 --> 1:27:46.540]  attacked for decades promoting americana and hunting and you'll freedom and and now you're
[1:27:46.540 --> 1:27:51.580]  seeing the same thing but it's almost completely positive you know what alex i think being married
[1:27:51.580 --> 1:27:57.660]  to ted for 31 years i've learned so much and i've learned how to grow thicker skin and ted you know
[1:27:57.660 --> 1:28:04.140]  ted he doesn't let the haters get to him in fact it fuels his fire even more and i've learned a lot
[1:28:04.140 --> 1:28:11.740]  from that the work there's always going to be haters so i get 99.999 percent such positive
[1:28:11.740 --> 1:28:17.020]  feedback on all my social media people that i've literally i'm not kidding you i've saved their
[1:28:17.020 --> 1:28:23.260]  lives so that's what keeps me going and that's what you and i and ted and the president and all of
[1:28:23.260 --> 1:28:28.860]  us who are in this position that we can help other people need to focus on is the positive
[1:28:28.860 --> 1:28:32.700]  spreading the love and spreading the joy no i totally agree and i know other people that know
[1:28:32.700 --> 1:28:36.780]  you and you've also helped us you really care about people and really help folks in their lives you've
[1:28:36.780 --> 1:28:41.020]  helped my wife it's amazing and what you're saying is that empowers you it's better to give

[1:30:38.860 --> 1:30:45.660]  martial law about a seven on a one to ten rickshaw scale get ready folks the democrats
[1:30:45.660 --> 1:30:52.860]  just like the chai comms are setting the bar for martial law full on secret arrest fema camps
[1:30:52.860 --> 1:30:59.740]  you name it but the homeless and illegal aliens are all exempt we've all heard of the strike
[1:31:00.620 --> 1:31:06.220]  it's a socialist of communist tactic but sometimes populist movements have used the strike
[1:31:06.220 --> 1:31:13.020]  you can have labor strikes you can have people that also boycott and refuse to use a company or
[1:31:13.020 --> 1:31:18.780]  a service and many times when the people actually get together and move and master the strike it
[1:31:18.780 --> 1:31:27.420]  has a great effect and some good things have come out of it but now we are seeing a globalist
[1:31:27.420 --> 1:31:35.580]  corporate strike by shutting down key institutions at key times led by big tech over a month ago
[1:31:35.580 --> 1:31:41.660]  to then set the precedent to shut down small companies and businesses across the world but
[1:31:41.660 --> 1:31:49.740]  notice the big globalist corporations in the big box stores they are all exempt this is more than
[1:31:49.740 --> 1:31:54.220]  just martial law training this is the globalist trying to create a worldwide depression they can
[1:31:54.220 --> 1:32:02.780]  blame on trump and they even admit they're doing it the globalist and the enemy of the people
[1:32:02.780 --> 1:32:09.420]  corporate media have worked overtime like the devil to destroy all independent pro america
[1:32:09.420 --> 1:32:14.780]  truth-based media and chief amongst their enemy has been in full wars but thanks to you spreading
[1:32:14.780 --> 1:32:18.780]  the word and thanks to you supporting them for wars we are still on the air and have actually

[1:34:02.060 --> 1:34:05.580]  guys want to go because i gotta ask a lot of questions i got a hundred of them what does
[1:34:05.580 --> 1:34:10.380]  ted think about what's happening what is your main thing uh what it's like to be i mean i know
[1:34:10.380 --> 1:34:14.140]  you already live out on the land anyway so this is normal for you where do you think this is going
[1:34:14.140 --> 1:34:19.820]  great to have you here ted well back at you especially to share it with the queen of the
[1:34:19.820 --> 1:34:26.220]  forest are you kidding me i'm a lucky man but alex looked how lucky i really am the bottom line is i
[1:34:26.220 --> 1:34:33.660]  think i share you know self-evident truth i'm going logic and and widespread common sense just
[1:34:33.660 --> 1:34:38.780]  getting off of my facebook now there's a lot of positive energy and spirit what i'm witnessing
[1:34:38.780 --> 1:34:43.580]  what shaman and i are celebrating here is that our neighbors here in texas and all my buddies up in
[1:34:43.580 --> 1:34:49.020]  michigan i talked to quite honestly on facebook i think i've communicated with all 50 states and
[1:34:49.020 --> 1:34:55.580]  all canadian provinces i think a guy from ireland a guy from belgium a guy from germany and france
[1:34:55.580 --> 1:35:04.140]  and in this horrible uncharted territories uh there there is some panic but majority of my fellow
[1:35:04.140 --> 1:35:10.700]  humans are helping their neighbors they're already fortified the the last boy scout is alive and well
[1:35:10.700 --> 1:35:16.060]  in this country and those of us that don't have to scramble in an emergency for toilet paper
[1:35:16.060 --> 1:35:22.540]  we're adequately prepared for at least a few weeks the new jen family for at least a year but the people
[1:35:22.540 --> 1:35:29.580]  who are intelligent conscientious tuned in they're helping our neighbors they're helping those in
[1:35:29.580 --> 1:35:35.820]  need right now so yes the pandemic is uh not the road less traveled it's literally a non-road
[1:35:35.820 --> 1:35:41.180]  that's never been traveled before and i'm watching the press conferences by the greatest president
[1:35:41.180 --> 1:35:48.380]  in the history of this country and boy is he in his finest hours he's not acting presidential
[1:35:48.380 --> 1:35:56.380]  because the past presidents gave the control of our lifesaving medical and antibiotic development
[1:35:56.380 --> 1:36:04.700]  to the genocidal tyrannical communist chinese so president trump is fixing this horrific
[1:36:04.700 --> 1:36:10.940]  criminal deep swamp deep state abuse of power and i think we're going to come out of this like
[1:36:10.940 --> 1:36:17.260]  president trump said just a moment ago better and stronger because i hope people learn to be
[1:36:17.260 --> 1:36:23.660]  prepared so they can help those amongst us who are less prepared now i think you're right over all
[1:36:23.660 --> 1:36:28.940]  ted but you're kind of up on the mountain i mean i've been to your place you're a tough guy at 71
[1:36:28.940 --> 1:36:33.500]  you're in a lot better shape than you know most men that are 30 uh you've got an awesome wife that's a
[1:36:33.500 --> 1:36:37.260]  that's beyond her bio queen of the forest is really who she is amazing people and you're
[1:36:37.260 --> 1:36:40.940]  prepared and you're ready and you can skin a buck run a trot line and your neighbors are you know
[1:36:40.940 --> 1:36:45.340]  out there outside wake up they're here in the heart of texas is north austin which is enemy
[1:36:45.340 --> 1:36:50.620]  territory now but when you go to the leftist areas and the homeless everywhere and the feces
[1:36:50.620 --> 1:36:54.860]  and the needles and they're they don't know how to take care of themselves during this breakdown
[1:36:54.860 --> 1:36:58.700]  in new york and california they're exempting all of them they're letting prisoners out
[1:36:58.700 --> 1:37:02.620]  by the thousands i'm really concerned about the dark side so i'm not trying to be negative here
[1:37:02.620 --> 1:37:06.300]  but let's i mean i know from the world of ted new june who's got his act together things are
[1:37:06.300 --> 1:37:11.020]  looking good because you were prepared but what about the leftist what about these people that
[1:37:11.020 --> 1:37:17.580]  quite frankly can't even find their ass with both hands well we're we're well aware that we're
[1:37:17.580 --> 1:37:23.020]  celebrating the good and it's important that you and i and shaman does this all the time
[1:37:23.020 --> 1:37:29.260]  we maximize the good but but in order to maximize the good you have to do what you just said alex
[1:37:29.260 --> 1:37:34.780]  and that spotlight the bad and the ugly and the bad and the ugly is what i just said a moment ago
[1:37:34.780 --> 1:37:40.700]  that our past administrations in the united states of america gave our lifesaving medical
[1:37:40.700 --> 1:37:47.820]  and antibiotic productivity to the genocidal tyrannical communist chinese and what you're
[1:37:47.820 --> 1:37:56.060]  identified the california thesis and needle epicenter homeless cluster whack of the world
[1:37:56.060 --> 1:38:04.460]  it was already worse than the than covid-19 because of democrats and liberal power abusers
[1:38:04.460 --> 1:38:09.900]  and and criminals within our government that sell off the shares of their travel and hotel
[1:38:09.900 --> 1:38:16.140]  stack with insider information so we're well aware of the bad and the ugly so i think that the good
[1:38:16.140 --> 1:38:22.220]  amongst us will indeed help as many of the ill prepared or even the bad and ugly that is out
[1:38:22.220 --> 1:38:28.780]  there but i think we have to be cock locked ready to rock the clock more now than ever because these
[1:38:28.780 --> 1:38:35.900]  power abusing elected employees are literally making it worse by letting dangerous criminals
[1:38:35.900 --> 1:38:41.740]  out by the thousands across the country but i gotta tell you not only do we prepare ourselves
[1:38:41.740 --> 1:38:47.980]  with toilet paper and water and fish and meat and venison and medical supplies and fuel and
[1:38:47.980 --> 1:38:54.780]  generators there's a whole bunch of us out here but believe me we have unlimited firepower and if
[1:38:54.780 --> 1:39:01.340]  these released recidivistic monsters want to mess with the good people of america we will cut them
[1:39:01.340 --> 1:39:07.020]  in half to protect our families write that down and that's why i'm glad you're here and i want
[1:39:07.020 --> 1:39:13.020]  shaman to pop it anytime with her views on this but well you know you know what alex i i really
[1:39:13.020 --> 1:39:18.940]  think that this is a this is a great opportunity for us to do a reset a reboot to think about what
[1:39:18.940 --> 1:39:25.500]  is really important to us and that's family god family country and our health and i've always
[1:39:25.500 --> 1:39:30.940]  been a healthy lifestyle ambassador and i feel like now more than ever those of us who are healthy
[1:39:30.940 --> 1:39:36.700]  and those of us who are strong and those of us who can still get out reach out to people in your
[1:39:36.700 --> 1:39:40.940]  life people in your community who might need a helping hand there's a lot of good people right
[1:39:40.940 --> 1:39:48.060]  now who might need some assistance and that's where americans are so exactly everybody needs to
[1:39:48.060 --> 1:39:52.540]  adopt some people that are in need instead of the welfare system programming and using them we all
[1:39:52.540 --> 1:40:00.300]  need to reach out and and and help people yep i totally agree and it's it's a great opportunity
[1:40:00.300 --> 1:40:07.020]  for us to okay let's get rid of the junk food let's think about fueling our body with super food
[1:40:07.020 --> 1:40:12.060]  nutrition what nutrition we can and yeah what are you doing to chat over here because i've met him
[1:40:12.060 --> 1:40:17.660]  a few many times in person years ago but hanging out at your house uh i mean he was 70 when i was
[1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:24.380]  there a year ago i mean seriously this guy is like a like a super space alien elf or something i mean
[1:40:24.380 --> 1:40:30.620]  i mean he looks like he's about 50 can i can i tell him what we did the other day here in this room
[1:40:30.620 --> 1:40:37.420]  yeah sure he's right me boy you haven't stretched to you man this will be stretch you alex i made
[1:40:37.420 --> 1:40:42.300]  him get down on the floor and do some stretching exercises and yoga and i said look pal i'm gonna
[1:40:42.300 --> 1:40:46.540]  need you around so you better start taking care of yourself because he was complaining that he
[1:40:46.540 --> 1:40:51.100]  couldn't put his socks on i'm like oh no i'm not going to be putting them my your socks on for you
[1:40:51.100 --> 1:40:55.420]  you're going to put your socks on yourself so yeah we need to take care of each other
[1:40:55.420 --> 1:41:00.940]  and we need to help one another we need to stretch our bodies stretch our minds stretch our air
[1:41:00.940 --> 1:41:06.780]  capacity stretch our instinct to self defense and as she helped me stretch in the floor alex
[1:41:06.780 --> 1:41:13.740]  we went right to the firing range and we trained and practiced with our firearms and she is such a
[1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:22.300]  samurai zen aim small miss small tactically aware individual that's that's as important as having
[1:41:22.300 --> 1:41:27.660]  food and water and medicine for your families is to be able to defend yourself and when our government
[1:41:28.380 --> 1:41:33.500]  when these different democrat punks well that's where i was going i'm sure you know this but
[1:41:33.500 --> 1:41:38.540]  it's hardly getting news they're banning gun cells in california most areas they're they're passing
[1:41:38.540 --> 1:41:44.220]  laws you can't transport you're on firearm in uh louisiana what in the hell is we need our guns more
[1:41:44.220 --> 1:41:51.820]  than ever uh during a lockdown well we train every day i just had a bunch of guys out here yesterday
[1:41:51.820 --> 1:41:57.660]  we're actually testing some new body armor a scenic body armor that is lightweight and it stops
[1:41:57.660 --> 1:42:03.100]  much more powerful ballistics and it's more maneuverable for law enforcement and military and
[1:42:03.100 --> 1:42:11.500]  for civilians uh you know we don't like to think in terms of mass dangerous you know uh rioting
[1:42:12.060 --> 1:42:18.220]  but it's happened in the past i was in detroit in 1967 during that firestorm summer when the riots
[1:42:18.220 --> 1:42:23.420]  were completely out of control and it's really interesting to note that people are scrambling
[1:42:23.420 --> 1:42:28.140]  to buy toilet paper and guns and ammo you should already have toilet paper and you should already
[1:42:28.140 --> 1:42:34.060]  have guns and ammo and you should know how to use both that's right ted newgent ted newgent.com

[1:46:10.700 --> 1:46:14.620]  food and get it to everybody that ordered it most of you've already gotten your food but
[1:46:14.620 --> 1:46:19.740]  the reason i'm making this announcement is all the other major food suppliers were sold out
[1:46:19.740 --> 1:46:25.020]  over a month ago as we first reported to you but they lied to you and they took your money
[1:46:25.020 --> 1:46:30.860]  well we know for the fact they're still taking everybody's money even though the food has all
[1:46:30.860 --> 1:46:37.420]  been sold out the basic ingredients for storeable food is gone all the big box stores are paying way
[1:46:37.420 --> 1:46:43.100]  over normal prices to buy up what's left and so anybody telling you that they have storeable food
[1:46:43.100 --> 1:46:48.460]  is lying to you the good news is everyone that ordered an info war store dot com has already
[1:46:48.460 --> 1:46:53.260]  gotten it or if you ordered recently we have the food is being packaged and you will get it but as
[1:46:53.260 --> 1:46:57.340]  of now we are suspending all new food sales at info war store dot com

[1:47:07.340 --> 1:47:17.740]  no surprise globalist you didn't think you'd take all our rights did you
[1:47:19.580 --> 1:47:27.820]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[1:47:27.820 --> 1:47:34.220]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones by the way with chameleon
[1:47:34.220 --> 1:47:40.220]  newgent and ted newgent it's not an act all their positivity and i'm not a famous rock star like
[1:47:40.220 --> 1:47:44.380]  ted newgent but being on the air for 26 years i've met a lot of them and they're just all
[1:47:44.940 --> 1:47:51.980]  even they're nice people they're rex and they don't live you know past 55 usually ted 71 and he does
[1:47:51.980 --> 1:47:56.140]  look like he's you know a guy who's 60 in shape his knees may hurt and stuff like that you know
[1:47:56.140 --> 1:48:00.380]  things go out and his wife look at her so it's not about oh look at these guys they're so great
[1:48:00.380 --> 1:48:05.740]  they live a little cottage on a ranch in texas and got one up in michigan and they're so happy
[1:48:05.740 --> 1:48:09.980]  and so when they're giving you this advice it's really real and i get really negative because
[1:48:09.980 --> 1:48:14.220]  i get so pissed off at the globalist but i was thinking even last night this morning i got to
[1:48:14.220 --> 1:48:17.580]  go on air they didn't even say they're going to get positive like this bring up good things
[1:48:17.580 --> 1:48:21.980]  and we talked about the positive things our kids aren't in the schools getting brainwashed and drag
[1:48:21.980 --> 1:48:27.340]  queen story time and uh families are together and usually i get so busy i tell my wife don't cook
[1:48:27.340 --> 1:48:31.820]  or whatever just order food in i've been cooking dinner and with her and having fun and with the
[1:48:31.820 --> 1:48:38.460]  kids more and it's just been better and so there are a lot of positive things uh coming out of this
[1:48:38.460 --> 1:48:41.980]  i didn't mean to steer us down that direction ted nugent shaman nugent you want to comment more
[1:48:41.980 --> 1:48:45.900]  on that or what else in the 10 minutes we have left is on your radar screen that you'd like to
[1:48:45.900 --> 1:48:53.740]  impart to the troops out there you know when we are having our kids indoors more often and there
[1:48:53.740 --> 1:48:58.060]  might be a time where we have to homeschool them we all might have to do that and i homeschooled
[1:48:58.060 --> 1:49:03.020]  rocko for a little bit and i know here are a couple of tips that i can share with people um
[1:49:03.020 --> 1:49:07.900]  take a designated amount of time that you know you can withstand and your kids can withstand
[1:49:07.900 --> 1:49:13.980]  and have a designated area for learning only that means shut down the ipads and whatever other
[1:49:13.980 --> 1:49:19.740]  instruments your your kids have and just focus on learning and then here's another big one
[1:49:19.740 --> 1:49:27.020]  is talk about what they learned ask them questions remember the old show and tell well ask them to
[1:49:27.020 --> 1:49:32.620]  show you what they learned ask them to tell you what they learned so that you're listening because
[1:49:32.620 --> 1:49:37.980]  you know what i see a lot of parents that just aren't really listening and aren't interacting with
[1:49:37.980 --> 1:49:43.580]  their kids and they give them you know cell phone devices and they keep them busy but this is an
[1:49:43.580 --> 1:49:49.660]  opportunity for us to reset and reboot and spend time with our kids you know it's scary when
[1:49:49.660 --> 1:49:53.340]  i go to a store or a restaurant and i look and none of the families are talking they're on
[1:49:53.340 --> 1:49:57.660]  their phones and then i catch myself doing it as well you're right we've got to compartmentalize
[1:49:57.660 --> 1:50:03.340]  this stuff and designate the times we're going to do it ted your take on that well yeah you're
[1:50:03.340 --> 1:50:09.100]  we're talking truth logic and common sense based on the lifestyle of being tuned in and being
[1:50:09.100 --> 1:50:15.100]  conscientious of your surroundings and being raised in a hunting family i've always been
[1:50:15.100 --> 1:50:23.020]  fascinated and passionate about listening to the birds and watching the habitat and managing the
[1:50:23.020 --> 1:50:28.620]  wildlife and feeding my family the purest most organic natural food in the world that i hunt
[1:50:28.620 --> 1:50:34.620]  every year i kill it and i grill it and at 71 not not just because i've been clean and sober my
[1:50:34.620 --> 1:50:39.980]  whole life but because i've been conscientious about my diet so these are times now with the
[1:50:39.980 --> 1:50:47.340]  you allude to the the tragedy of brainwashing in our anti-education system yes we need to talk more
[1:50:47.340 --> 1:50:53.500]  about a healthy lifestyle but parents have to do what i've done with all my sons and daughters and
[1:50:53.500 --> 1:51:03.740]  shaman and i did with rocko drugs alcohol tobacco vaping that is not making ends meet that is not
[1:51:03.740 --> 1:51:11.660]  quality of life investment consumerism i think now during this uh dangerous pandemic now's the time
[1:51:11.660 --> 1:51:16.860]  to look at our brothers and sisters our families our sons and daughters and grandchildren and go
[1:51:16.860 --> 1:51:23.100]  what are you doing with your life what are you eating today what what are those words on the
[1:51:23.100 --> 1:51:28.860]  contents of that package what did they tell you say that because i've instinctively done that i
[1:51:28.860 --> 1:51:32.940]  quit drinking for about five months a hundred percent and lost like 40 pounds felt great started
[1:51:32.940 --> 1:51:37.420]  back a little bit and instantly had an issue you know a problem and and you're right people just
[1:51:37.420 --> 1:51:43.260]  ought to hang it up i mean the world's too dangerous things are too crazy we need to get back to being
[1:51:43.260 --> 1:51:49.180]  you know more focused because the world is a dangerous place and you know i gotta tell you
[1:51:49.180 --> 1:51:54.220]  i do a lot of podcasts a lot of interviews and i'm on my facebook i'm a communication guy i really
[1:51:54.220 --> 1:51:59.740]  love the people around me my band my crew my wonderful family my neighbors my buddies that come out
[1:51:59.740 --> 1:52:05.340]  and shoot hunt and fish and we run trap lines and we go off-roading in our broncos so i'm a real
[1:52:05.340 --> 1:52:12.780]  gregarious guy but i've also found out that if you don't know about the capabilities the evil depth
[1:52:13.580 --> 1:52:21.340]  of our historical mankind abuses if your children don't know about the trail of tears the rape of
[1:52:21.340 --> 1:52:27.660]  nan king the baton death march if you don't know about wounded knee if you don't know about the
[1:52:27.660 --> 1:52:34.780]  atrocities that big government have perpetuated and perpetrated upon civilian publics unsuspecting
[1:52:34.780 --> 1:52:41.580]  civilian publics if you haven't taught your children the tragedies of mankind that i mean i can't
[1:52:41.580 --> 1:52:46.140]  find anybody that's heard about the rape of nan king and then you have people that'll literally
[1:52:46.140 --> 1:52:51.900]  look at you go well i can't believe that a human being would hurt another human being well these
[1:52:51.900 --> 1:52:56.460]  are the kinds of bad and ugly realities that we have to teach our children and our friends if
[1:52:56.460 --> 1:53:02.060]  you're not aware of the depth of evil that mankind is capable of you have subjected yourself and opened
[1:53:02.060 --> 1:53:08.540]  yourself up to the naivete that it could happen again and i believe that when you give control to
[1:53:08.540 --> 1:53:15.180]  elected employees who turn over the life and death control of our medicines and antibiotics
[1:53:15.660 --> 1:53:22.780]  to the communist chinese government the curse of apathy is the most suicidal irresponsibility
[1:53:22.780 --> 1:53:28.780]  that americans have ever committed and i hopefully wake up to that and you know what yeah sorry man
[1:53:28.780 --> 1:53:34.300]  go ahead that's okay i just wanted to interject you know there's a lot of negativity going on in
[1:53:34.300 --> 1:53:39.580]  the world right now and a lot of things to be scared about but one thing that we can do is
[1:53:39.580 --> 1:53:45.500]  learn from history uh talk to our kids about it and write about it you know what we're going through
[1:53:45.500 --> 1:53:53.820]  now uh in five or ten or 20 or 50 years is going is epic so write about it and talk about it with
[1:53:53.820 --> 1:53:59.740]  your kids and your family members and get all those get all those hurt feelings out and and
[1:53:59.740 --> 1:54:07.020]  talk to people about it because we have we have an obligation to survive and to thrive and to
[1:54:07.020 --> 1:54:13.260]  spread the love i really believe that that's why i'm here i'm doing your show and why ted and i are
[1:54:13.260 --> 1:54:19.660]  really talking about spreading the love and and being self-sufficient so now is a good time to think
[1:54:19.660 --> 1:54:24.700]  about what's most important to you and your family and to really take some stock in what you've been
[1:54:24.700 --> 1:54:29.420]  doing and reboot no i totally agree but since ted mentioned this because i've been following him
[1:54:29.420 --> 1:54:33.820]  since i was a kid um he always had positive things to say about native americans so the
[1:54:33.820 --> 1:54:38.220]  leftist media claimed he hated native americans and i want to just tell you guys this but you always
[1:54:38.220 --> 1:54:44.780]  know the stuff in the media about me many times a hundred percent fake just none of it's even real
[1:54:44.780 --> 1:54:49.500]  you've experienced that i don't think the public realizes that when you promote america and freedom
[1:54:49.500 --> 1:54:54.300]  and the second amendment and god and country you get demonized for saying be self-sufficient
[1:54:54.300 --> 1:54:59.260]  you're a scammer or or you're a racist and and trump's been through this worse than all of us
[1:54:59.260 --> 1:55:04.220]  combined but i know the listeners know who we really are and i'm not whining i'm just saying we
[1:55:04.220 --> 1:55:09.580]  also need to point out that the corporate media literally are the scum of the earth and you can't
[1:55:09.580 --> 1:55:15.420]  believe a damn thing they say before ted jumps in because i know he's got a lot to say about this
[1:55:15.420 --> 1:55:19.660]  i want to encourage people before you tweet something or text something or post something
[1:55:19.660 --> 1:55:25.660]  negative and somebody else's feed or page or whatever take stock those who throw the first stone
[1:55:26.220 --> 1:55:31.020]  take stock about what you're doing and why you really need to say those negative things let's
[1:55:31.020 --> 1:55:36.940]  let's try to create a new loving environment for one another no i totally agree i wish the corporate
[1:55:36.940 --> 1:55:41.340]  media would stop saying outrageous lies about me but i'm just i'm just pointing out that people
[1:55:41.340 --> 1:55:47.900]  don't know how big a liar as they are until you've been targeted by him ted well what i have to do
[1:55:47.900 --> 1:55:54.060]  is witness any of my so-called debates how i completely decapitated pierce morgan or the
[1:55:54.060 --> 1:55:58.700]  even the texas public television when they try to take me out about regarding the second amendment
[1:55:58.700 --> 1:56:05.820]  i am so addicted and i'm so good at delivering truth logic and common sense that is just saturated
[1:56:05.820 --> 1:56:11.180]  with historical and so all they can do is why everything i stand for so they know they can't
[1:56:11.180 --> 1:56:16.940]  debate me they're absolutely helpless to debate me so they have to make up the nastiest lies in
[1:56:16.940 --> 1:56:23.340]  the planet and i believe that even more than president trump i have been lied about and hated
[1:56:23.340 --> 1:56:30.620]  more than anybody because my truth logic and common sense is untouchable and they hate that i'm a
[1:56:30.620 --> 1:56:35.420]  hunter they hate that i believe in the second amendment they hate that i'm a cop they hate that
[1:56:35.420 --> 1:56:43.900]  i'm anti-drug and alcohol they literally i live the perfect life and the left hates rugged individuals
[1:56:43.900 --> 1:56:48.700]  they hate people who declare their independence they hate people who can stand up on their own
[1:56:48.700 --> 1:56:55.580]  and i you can see the smile on my face alex we talked about this i am so proud that the scum of
[1:56:55.580 --> 1:57:02.460]  the earth hate me even better than i really am exactly i know you guys have got to go it's a
[1:57:02.460 --> 1:57:06.140]  two minute break i want to just finish up with five minutes on the other side to talk about the
[1:57:06.140 --> 1:57:10.060]  tour to talk about the book to talk about what you think the next challenge to trump will be
[1:57:10.060 --> 1:57:15.020]  because obviously this corona virus is a big challenge but they just keep coming at him with
[1:57:15.020 --> 1:57:20.140]  other challenges and i just can't believe it's 73 uh the only other person i know that's near
[1:57:20.140 --> 1:57:25.340]  that age is dynamic is ted newton i'm not kissing your ass it's just a fact shamane newton is here
[1:57:25.340 --> 1:57:28.220]  with us as well we're going to break for two minutes do five more minutes and then i've opened
[1:57:28.220 --> 1:57:32.860]  the phones up the law enforcement and military about the martial law preparations and what you
[1:57:32.860 --> 1:57:37.260]  think about it and then mike adams joins us in the fourth hour in the war room with oan shroyer
[1:57:37.260 --> 1:57:41.740]  comes up after that remember we're on hundreds of radio stations but the only way you find our videos
[1:57:41.740 --> 1:57:48.700]  and audio online is ban dot video and news wars dot com so share those links last sunday info wars
[1:57:48.700 --> 1:57:55.580]  exclusively reported from white house sources that trump was considering an interstate travel ban
[1:57:55.580 --> 1:58:01.420]  inside the united states a form of martial law that's never been implemented in our history
[1:58:02.060 --> 1:58:07.260]  some folks said when it didn't come true that we made it up what we said was he was considering it
[1:58:07.260 --> 1:58:12.380]  and days later it came out in mainstream news that indeed that was happening well now we're
[1:58:12.380 --> 1:58:17.580]  getting intel that trump's looking at declaring a national emergency this sunday and doing just that
[1:58:17.580 --> 1:58:23.980]  but isn't sure if it's the right move and boom governor newtsom comes out says 40 million people
[1:58:23.980 --> 1:58:30.140]  can't leave their houses that's martial law and says he may officially declare martial law the
[1:58:30.140 --> 1:58:37.420]  globalist the leftist the chai cons the eu they're all setting the bar for massive martial law or
[1:58:37.420 --> 1:58:43.820]  trump hasn't done his job and they'll blame every death on trump this is extremely dangerous time
[1:58:43.820 --> 1:58:53.980]  we're covering it live on the radio right now france spain italy denmark sweden the list goes on
[1:58:53.980 --> 1:59:01.340]  and on they've all declared martial law and said that if you leave your house without authorization
[1:59:01.340 --> 1:59:07.820]  you'll be put in jail for up to six months but they've been releasing by the tens of thousands
[1:59:07.820 --> 1:59:15.100]  per country the hardened criminals the rapists and murderers and car thieves and home invaders and
[1:59:15.100 --> 1:59:21.740]  it's the same thing in democrat run cesspit blue cities here as well tens of thousands released
[1:59:21.740 --> 1:59:27.340]  and now governor newtsom says he may declare martial law and has already ordered 40 million
[1:59:27.340 --> 1:59:33.980]  people in california to stay in their houses or six months in jail but publicly stated illegal
[1:59:33.980 --> 1:59:41.420]  aliens islamic invaders so-called migrants and of course the homeless are all exempt i'm not
[1:59:41.420 --> 1:59:47.180]  getting look it up welcome to slavery they think they own you and now they're about to show you
[1:59:47.180 --> 1:59:53.820]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:01.180 --> 2:00:05.740]  i don't want to know that i'm leaving you've been doing great oh and you're going to finish up with
[2:00:05.740 --> 2:00:10.620]  these calls within greg rees and of course harrison smith are going to take another hour calls
[2:00:10.620 --> 2:00:15.500]  the cruise volunteered to do it so we're here live covering this hoping everything de-escalates
[2:00:15.500 --> 2:00:19.500]  so the live coverage continues everybody spread those links the globals are hacking us
[2:00:19.500 --> 2:00:23.660]  trying to shut this down don't let them win no bs doesn't tell you everything's straight shooting
[2:00:23.660 --> 2:00:28.620]  here see i don't have some mackey valet manipulative view with me it's all straightforward attack
[2:00:28.620 --> 2:00:35.900]  that's the real power don't act so surprised globalist you didn't think you could silence the
[2:00:35.900 --> 2:00:42.940]  american people did you join bandart video and i will complete your training together we can
[2:00:42.940 --> 2:00:45.820]  overthrow the emperor and restore the republic
[2:00:49.100 --> 2:00:53.100]  yeah james rose jones did that for us no that's actually me uh we've got the motor
[2:00:53.100 --> 2:00:59.660]  city madman and his queen of the forest uh is is true uh absolutely uh and social main
[2:00:59.660 --> 2:01:05.340]  newton is here with us as well all right the four minutes we have left uh tell us about
[2:01:05.340 --> 2:01:10.540]  everything on planet newton and then in closing what do you think the next attack on trump's gonna be
[2:01:10.540 --> 2:01:17.100]  well mrs newton is the boss here we have a great relationship we've been married for 31 years
[2:01:17.100 --> 2:01:23.580]  nicely done unbelievable so we have quality of life and we earn our own way we live within our
[2:01:23.580 --> 2:01:30.060]  means and we save for a rainy day and that triad of quality of the american dream it existed when
[2:01:30.060 --> 2:01:35.980]  i had zero dollars and it exists when i have a bunch of dollars so i think people have to
[2:01:35.980 --> 2:01:41.740]  really intelligently reprioritize how they spend their money and i guess the most glaring example
[2:01:41.740 --> 2:01:48.780]  is that people with gargantuan student loans are buying five dollar cups of coffee at starbucks
[2:01:48.780 --> 2:01:54.780]  people have lost their minds in prioritization and quality of life and what we're experiencing
[2:01:54.780 --> 2:02:02.220]  during this pandemic is a scramble for damage control because somebody didn't have the intellectual
[2:02:02.220 --> 2:02:09.580]  wherewithal for quality control quality control always beats damage control and that's how we
[2:02:09.580 --> 2:02:15.020]  live our life we are aware of our surroundings we're aware of our cause and effect and we we
[2:02:15.020 --> 2:02:21.820]  dedicate ourselves to make sacrifices so we're in the asset column for our family our neighborhood
[2:02:21.820 --> 2:02:28.860]  our country our fellow man and planet earth it's so simple it's stupid and you know for me life is
[2:02:28.860 --> 2:02:33.180]  all about being healthy because i know what it's like to lose my health i was diagnosed with having
[2:02:33.180 --> 2:02:39.260]  preemphasia from toxic mold between the walls no way too much about that if anybody wants to know
[2:02:39.820 --> 2:02:47.340]  i'm actually producing a documentary about it i yeah i'll talk all i know way too much about it
[2:02:47.340 --> 2:02:53.020]  great book get this book literally people alex come on my facebook they read shamane's book
[2:02:53.020 --> 2:03:00.700]  and they they get all emotional because it's a reminder of life quality 101 and it's so
[2:03:00.700 --> 2:03:05.820]  laid out in a in a pragmatic utilitarian way in this book that people go to shamane's what
[2:03:05.820 --> 2:03:12.460]  is shamane rocks dot com shamane shamane urgent dot rocks but i'm also on instagram and facebook

[2:05:50.060 --> 2:06:13.900]  everything 40 at info or store dot com the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones
[2:06:13.900 --> 2:06:25.740]  show
[2:06:44.460 --> 2:06:50.620]  ladies and gentlemen we have a lot of different guests on a lot of different views and i want
[2:06:50.620 --> 2:06:56.140]  to believe the views from shamane newton and ted newton that this is a great opportunity for america
[2:06:56.140 --> 2:07:02.220]  to get back to its basic values and show how the patriots have been prepared and how we've been
[2:07:02.220 --> 2:07:07.340]  right all along which is which is true i'm worried about warning people about what's coming next
[2:07:07.340 --> 2:07:14.220]  because i gotta tell you we know what we're talking about we've proven it our guests our callers our
[2:07:14.220 --> 2:07:23.660]  research is just unparalleled and trump's the real deal the globalists are after him they
[2:07:23.660 --> 2:07:29.180]  launched us to take him out he has been doing a balancing act trying to save the economy and things
[2:07:30.380 --> 2:07:34.140]  at the same time no one they're gonna set him up for anybody that dies regardless nothing he does is
[2:07:34.140 --> 2:07:40.060]  going to be good they're trying to trick him into declaring a total emergency now saying they'll be
[2:07:40.060 --> 2:07:46.940]  nice if he dies and having a few operatives say oh look he's good now if he just shuts the economy
[2:07:46.940 --> 2:07:50.860]  down yeah we're gonna have a depression but it's not going to be his fault he's going to get blamed
[2:07:50.860 --> 2:07:57.500]  for that too because the globalist operate on this premise well the anything else is their prime rule
[2:07:57.500 --> 2:08:04.780]  you don't have a memory and so you're not going to remember that they said let the chinese fly in
[2:08:06.140 --> 2:08:10.940]  seven weeks ago and trump was trying to block it you're not going to remember the cdc under his
[2:08:10.940 --> 2:08:16.140]  nose shit people in that had it you're not going to remember that's what they think
[2:08:18.300 --> 2:08:25.820]  but his economic approval rating is up in most polls but they can skew those anytime they want
[2:08:25.820 --> 2:08:29.020]  so i've learned how they operate i've learned their tricks
[2:08:31.740 --> 2:08:40.860]  and if you ask a top baseball hitter how they know what ball the pitcher is going to throw
[2:08:41.740 --> 2:08:45.900]  they can just tell by the pitcher stance and watching him for years and and they can't tell
[2:08:45.900 --> 2:08:50.940]  you how they know they just know and it's the same thing thousands of data points go into this
[2:08:50.940 --> 2:08:57.180]  and we're just totally over the target and i'm not saying that to go oh i'm cool this is great
[2:08:58.380 --> 2:09:03.740]  ted nugent and shamane nugent are so competent and work so hard
[2:09:04.380 --> 2:09:11.500]  no folks that know him really well and are so happy that i don't want to say it blinds them
[2:09:11.500 --> 2:09:16.380]  because what they're seeing is what they're seeing is their perspective but it's all where you see
[2:09:16.380 --> 2:09:23.580]  something from the perspective of how you see it i'm here to tell you not to scare you because i
[2:09:23.580 --> 2:09:29.420]  remember about 10 years ago i was in a private meeting with a operative that was trying to hire
[2:09:29.420 --> 2:09:35.020]  me and i had the meeting to learn intel and i also had that meeting flying on a first class
[2:09:35.020 --> 2:09:40.700]  flight to be on the view i've told you 500 times about where it was the head of one of the largest
[2:09:40.700 --> 2:09:47.420]  banks had an off-record discussion with me he just said just don't say my name but i'll tell you humanity
[2:09:47.420 --> 2:09:52.220]  is going to adapt to the slow slavery and control we're gonna have corporate world government you're
[2:09:52.220 --> 2:10:04.140]  not gonna stop us and that's basically what this other globalist told me is he said alex we don't
[2:10:04.140 --> 2:10:08.620]  care that you're on air because you think people are like you and are competent and motivated and
[2:10:08.620 --> 2:10:13.260]  you're telling them bad things you think they're gonna act against it and you think they're gonna
[2:10:13.260 --> 2:10:18.300]  overcome it no they're going to get scared listening to you and they're gonna submit
[2:10:19.740 --> 2:10:24.460]  now i think they bet wrong look at trump look at the brazilian president look at all the things
[2:10:24.460 --> 2:10:29.100]  that are happening i think you were asleep i don't think you were scared
[2:10:31.740 --> 2:10:36.780]  but there's nothing like an invisible enemy and watching all those nightmare science fiction
[2:10:36.780 --> 2:10:48.860]  scenes out of china to get people to panic and i understand why you know we told employees if
[2:10:48.860 --> 2:10:52.860]  you want to work from home if you can go ahead a lot of them take care of grandparents that that's
[2:10:52.860 --> 2:10:57.900]  maybe maybe reason to go uh people some people that have children go i don't want them to get sick
[2:10:57.900 --> 2:11:05.980]  well no children have died but okay whatever but you better know that in the aggregate the panicked
[2:11:05.980 --> 2:11:12.780]  wall of people running for the hills when i talk to top food producers and top supplement producers
[2:11:16.780 --> 2:11:21.820]  they say well the warehouses people are just leaving and the supply chain is breaking down
[2:11:21.820 --> 2:11:25.500]  and i'm not kissing the butt of the truck drivers they say the truck drivers are all showing up
[2:11:27.020 --> 2:11:35.580]  but the managers at companies and places are just running for the hills and you see that the news
[2:11:35.580 --> 2:11:39.660]  that the billionaires are flying off in private jets and they've got armored bunkers that i told
[2:11:39.660 --> 2:11:44.380]  you about 20 years ago because i knew people in hollywood that had them and people all that's crazy
[2:11:44.380 --> 2:11:51.740]  james cameron had moved to new zealand avoid the apocalypse now he said he did
[2:11:52.620 --> 2:11:59.260]  being like a few years ago so globalism was about being able to choke countries off because
[2:11:59.260 --> 2:12:04.220]  everybody was interdependent hell they made an incredible movie back in the 70s with james con
[2:12:04.220 --> 2:12:12.860]  rollerblade and i remember being like eight years old watching it when it was on tv in like the early
[2:12:12.860 --> 2:12:18.300]  80s and my dad going read this is a big new brzezinski book when you get old enough son
[2:12:18.300 --> 2:12:23.180]  this movie is about what they plan to set up where every nation is independent on the other
[2:12:23.180 --> 2:12:28.540]  and and countries and cities city states actually control the countries and then one city produces
[2:12:28.540 --> 2:12:34.140]  energy and other produces propaganda entertainment and other produces weapons but all of them are
[2:12:34.140 --> 2:12:38.780]  independent but interdependent and its corporate boards will rule the planet well that's in the
[2:12:38.780 --> 2:12:46.700]  movie network when he explains that howard bill how the world really works and in blade runner
[2:12:47.900 --> 2:12:50.700]  they show you what they're planning but if you go back to rollerball
[2:12:50.700 --> 2:12:58.220]  james con is this world-famous superstar top rollerballer he won't quit he's supposed to get
[2:12:58.220 --> 2:13:01.980]  defeated in the end he's supposed to be torn down the corporates even take his wife they have that
[2:13:01.980 --> 2:13:06.300]  power like a like a lord of old prim and octu to take your wife or your daughter from him
[2:13:07.660 --> 2:13:11.900]  and he goes to try to find files about how the corporations took over and there's this one big
[2:13:11.900 --> 2:13:24.540]  mainframe liquid computer and he goes to the computer and they've gotten rid of all the books
[2:13:24.540 --> 2:13:29.340]  they've gotten rid of everything but for a while everything was available on this worldwide computer
[2:13:29.340 --> 2:13:36.780]  system called the internet it's in the movie but once it all went on to one ai computer it began
[2:13:36.780 --> 2:13:44.540]  to erase everything and so they're talking to the computer and he goes yes he categorizes things
[2:13:44.540 --> 2:13:50.700]  and then he loses them and you see once everything's on the cloud notice everything's getting lost
[2:13:50.700 --> 2:13:54.860]  now yes yeah yeah back this up with audio back it up i'm gonna play this for people because
[2:13:54.860 --> 2:14:10.780]  the they're telling you everything here here in his plan

[2:18:58.540 --> 2:19:04.620]  com that links to press releases by the swedish government that all air traffic into the country
[2:19:04.620 --> 2:19:11.660]  is shut down except if you're an asylum seeking plane funded by george soros landing from the

[2:19:30.940 --> 2:19:36.860]  they just haven't publicly put that name on it yet except for the california tyrant nuesome
[2:19:36.860 --> 2:19:42.620]  he's come out and said he may declare it and if he catches you outside your house you're going to
[2:19:42.620 --> 2:19:47.580]  prison because if you're not a hardened criminal you are not allied with him if you're a good

[2:20:26.460 --> 2:20:33.260]  today and i'm going to go to your calls quickly because i know you're busy if you have specific
[2:20:33.260 --> 2:20:43.660]  oh information from the national guard north com space command central command army special
[2:20:43.660 --> 2:20:50.940]  operations threat fusion centers state police on what you've been prepped and ready for
[2:20:52.380 --> 2:20:56.860]  and what you've been told i want you to call him we'll talk about it and i want to be a trillion
[2:20:56.860 --> 2:21:02.300]  percent clear they admit they're gearing up the national guard and regular army to take over
[2:21:02.300 --> 2:21:07.340]  critical infrastructure and that they're going to ratchet this up into full-blown martial law
[2:21:07.340 --> 2:21:11.340]  california new yorker already going under it and the democrats are setting the precedent
[2:21:12.140 --> 2:21:19.340]  that trump must do that or he's the reason people die then they're going to use the unrest that comes
[2:21:19.340 --> 2:21:23.820]  when the food and water starts running out in a few months because the left saying 18 months
[2:21:23.820 --> 2:21:28.460]  prom's got to go funny china only shut down for a month now they say they're back to normal but
[2:21:28.460 --> 2:21:33.900]  we've got to shut down 18 months they can have deaths but we can't and it's not going to stop
[2:21:33.900 --> 2:21:39.660]  the deaths folks it's going to make the curve go out longer and space it out over more times
[2:21:39.660 --> 2:21:43.900]  it doesn't overwhelm things could the globalist launch some other bio attack and blame it on
[2:21:43.900 --> 2:21:51.900]  this absolutely there's a lot of variables here but i told you weeks ago they're going to run out
[2:21:51.900 --> 2:21:56.060]  of food at the grocery store is because i know the big suppliers and now they're announcing
[2:21:56.060 --> 2:22:00.060]  that it's running out and the supply chain's breaking
[2:22:03.820 --> 2:22:08.780]  you know there's a big guardian article out demonizing yours truly and games will see rolls
[2:22:08.780 --> 2:22:14.140]  and others for predicting all of this specifically a virus doing this and the left and the globalist
[2:22:14.140 --> 2:22:20.940]  seizing on it for control because they said they would big guardian article talking about how i'm
[2:22:20.940 --> 2:22:27.580]  discredited because i said you should prep and get ready and because i predicted what was going on
[2:22:27.580 --> 2:22:31.980]  what was happening disinformation and blame how america's far right is capitalizing on coronavirus
[2:22:34.060 --> 2:22:39.100]  so see when you tell people don't get ready and you're wrong all the time and you stage fake
[2:22:39.100 --> 2:22:43.980]  stuff like abc saying you know the trump let turkey blow up a city and it was the knob creek
[2:22:43.980 --> 2:22:49.820]  machine and shoot out you're good guys but when you're actually trying to defend the republic
[2:22:49.820 --> 2:22:54.300]  and try to empower everybody well you've got to be shut down the left openly says they want to
[2:22:54.300 --> 2:22:58.540]  crash the economy to remove trump they want the virus to be deadly they want a depression
[2:22:58.540 --> 2:23:05.180]  and they're everywhere hyping it they're the villains and they're telling trump oh act nice
[2:23:05.180 --> 2:23:13.740]  during all this work with them they're all stabbing him in the back as we speak and so as soon as they
[2:23:13.740 --> 2:23:21.260]  are done tang on the stock market and as soon as the food starts running out they are going to turn
[2:23:21.260 --> 2:23:29.100]  on trump even more than they are now and this is their coup against america so i'm the one
[2:23:29.100 --> 2:23:33.660]  a month ago six weeks ago going trump you're behind the curve limbaugh saying it's no problem i get
[2:23:33.660 --> 2:23:37.340]  you're saying it might not be that deadly but the way they're hyping it they're coming for you
[2:23:37.340 --> 2:23:40.460]  they're going to frame you that you didn't do enough when the deaths start mounting and show
[2:23:40.460 --> 2:23:46.540]  their faces on tv as if you could stop this it's always a part of human life and it all comes out
[2:23:46.540 --> 2:23:53.180]  of china the bird flu the swine flu the sars the corona virus the wuhan virus
[2:23:58.700 --> 2:24:00.700]  so i want to give the number out
[2:24:00.700 --> 2:24:09.980]  out and i want to hear from individuals specifically because i already know that's
[2:24:09.980 --> 2:24:13.820]  activated i already know it's getting ready i already know from the federal society last weekend
[2:24:13.820 --> 2:24:18.460]  they were debating trump saying don't declare understate travel ban right now this is crazy it'll
[2:24:18.460 --> 2:24:22.540]  kill the economy even faster and we exclusively reported that it came out two days later it
[2:24:22.540 --> 2:24:29.740]  was accurate of course it was my lawyer talked directly to the guy that was there so we know
[2:24:29.740 --> 2:24:36.460]  this so we're not asking for secret intel on tactics where that's we already know all that i'm
[2:24:36.460 --> 2:24:40.620]  i want the listeners to hear what you at the grassroots are hearing who are going to be the
[2:24:40.620 --> 2:24:45.900]  front lines of being around the virus because if you're just an average person and under 70 and
[2:24:45.900 --> 2:24:49.180]  aren't sick you're not going to have a big problem but if you're exposed to the different variants
[2:24:49.180 --> 2:24:55.500]  of it there's at least two different strains one is super deadly compared to the other but is
[2:24:55.500 --> 2:25:00.460]  only on surfaces the other is not very dangerous in his airborne still you got to worry about
[2:25:00.460 --> 2:25:05.260]  the the medical workers and the police the military and the rest of it but the military is not our
[2:25:05.260 --> 2:25:10.060]  enemy the police are our enemy but they're being maneuvered into a position to be our oppressors
[2:25:10.060 --> 2:25:15.180]  if this goes more than a few months and the left now already thinks they've got his buffaloed
[2:25:15.180 --> 2:25:20.620]  nuisance is so happy this is working great martial law is working wonderful we don't have to call
[2:25:20.620 --> 2:25:29.420]  it martial law it's a nuance but it is the people are submitting but in europe they're still bringing
[2:25:29.420 --> 2:25:34.300]  the muslims in and all the rest of it but oh but citizens can't leave their houses this is all about
[2:25:34.300 --> 2:25:41.740]  a power grab by the globalist so the toll free number is 877789 alex that is only for first
[2:25:41.740 --> 2:25:46.940]  responders or emergency workers people in health departments people in congress folks that want
[2:25:46.940 --> 2:25:57.820]  to call in anonymously at 87778925398777892539 with your first hand knowledge not text messages you
[2:25:57.820 --> 2:26:03.980]  got that somebody's flooding out there a spam this latest one is exactly what i've said i would
[2:26:03.980 --> 2:26:08.860]  have i would announce if i was trumps there wouldn't be a bunch of disruption the lowest time that'd
[2:26:08.860 --> 2:26:13.900]  be sunday night but so people have a chance to get prepared uh but what's dangerous about this is
[2:26:13.900 --> 2:26:19.820]  they keep closing the news tighter and tighter and tighter and a certain point with civilization it will
[2:26:19.820 --> 2:26:25.740]  make civilization stop it will make everybody leave work it will break down the the infrastructure
[2:26:26.460 --> 2:26:32.620]  and uh as licking their lips politico says in a huge report coronavirus will change the world
[2:26:32.620 --> 2:26:37.420]  permanently here's how and it goes over how we're not going to leave our houses now and it will be
[2:26:37.420 --> 2:26:42.940]  like weather reports the new viruses and robots will control us this is 2020 this is the dystopic
[2:26:42.940 --> 2:26:48.540]  nightmare all right let me just throw this out as well there is chloroquine in all these big
[2:26:48.540 --> 2:26:55.500]  studies and articles an old malaria drug may help the novel coronavirus abc news this is in big
[2:26:55.500 --> 2:27:01.820]  studies what does it do it pushes zinc reportedly into the cells and if there's zinc in the cells
[2:27:01.820 --> 2:27:07.100]  the viruses have trouble replicating strangely enough in big studies the same thing with uh
[2:27:07.100 --> 2:27:11.420]  colon cancer and things like that look at studies on zinc across the board well we have a great product
[2:27:11.420 --> 2:27:16.860]  that i'm not saying treats it i'm not saying this saves you i'm saying it's what i and my family are

[2:27:55.660 --> 2:28:01.020]  bunch of other stuff with the vitamins as well with the preglonone it turbocharges it all
[2:28:01.020 --> 2:28:08.780]  i told the guys to cut it 50 in price because it's an expensive formula for us to manufacture
[2:28:08.780 --> 2:28:13.980]  it's been cut 50 in price because people are searching out all the zinc and buying it up
[2:28:14.780 --> 2:28:19.980]  when everybody else goes up in price i go down in price real red pill and real red pill plus

[2:34:49.260 --> 2:34:54.940]  and local hospitals fema tent hospitals in fact there was an article yesterday on info wars dot
[2:34:54.940 --> 2:34:59.500]  com that i should have started the show with yes scroll down for folks to see photos please
[2:35:00.060 --> 2:35:07.260]  and it says exclusive first look at photos inside dallas corona virus quarantine facility
[2:35:07.260 --> 2:35:13.340]  i got sent these uh by some folks uh who were inside their working and the rows are just like
[2:35:13.340 --> 2:35:21.500]  what we saw in the big spanish flu outbreak in 1918 over 500 beds now in there at the k belly
[2:35:21.500 --> 2:35:26.220]  hutchinson center and they're telling the public oh it's just an overnight shelter it's not for
[2:35:26.220 --> 2:35:30.860]  coronavirus yes it's medical beds it's for coronavirus i called and talked to someone in
[2:35:30.860 --> 2:35:34.700]  the police department up in that area i'll sleep with that and there's at least three facilities
[2:35:34.700 --> 2:35:40.460]  already being set up so the government expects this to be big and to overwhelm the hospitals
[2:35:41.020 --> 2:35:47.100]  so we'll we'll see we've all got front row seats to it and k is in texas police officer north texas
[2:35:47.100 --> 2:35:52.940]  talking about the virus let's go to k first k thanks for calling yes alex thanks for taking
[2:35:52.940 --> 2:36:01.420]  my call uh just wanted to first just touch on how ill-prepared it appears that our department is
[2:36:01.420 --> 2:36:08.700]  in a lot of these health facilities uh i was in the hospital up here a few days ago and the nurses
[2:36:08.700 --> 2:36:14.860]  are just walking around like nothing's wrong they have their uh half of them don't have masks half
[2:36:14.860 --> 2:36:20.060]  of them are coughing they they just appear like you know what there's nothing we can do so we're
[2:36:20.060 --> 2:36:27.420]  just gonna just get the virus and just go about our business and uh you know out here taking calls
[2:36:27.420 --> 2:36:35.180]  and it looks like i had a couple cases already of officers that have uh tested positive next thing
[2:36:35.180 --> 2:36:41.340]  you know you got officers just not showing up uh then you got probably officers that are ready to
[2:36:41.340 --> 2:36:47.420]  retire just saying hey i'm coming in you know so that's what's going to be end up happening
[2:36:47.420 --> 2:36:53.260]  officers just gonna suddenly say what's it worth to me i could be at home protecting my family
[2:36:53.260 --> 2:36:58.540]  or i can be here just getting ill and uh dealing with riots you know
[2:37:01.260 --> 2:37:05.900]  i can see that chain reaction because even of 10 000 people died it's gonna be the end of the
[2:37:05.900 --> 2:37:11.100]  world with a hysteria hell one person's sick in a town everyone runs in fear uh and it did
[2:37:11.100 --> 2:37:15.100]  some estimates are in the hundreds of thousands the media and press conferences says three million
[2:37:15.100 --> 2:37:20.540]  there's no evidence of that the number keeps going down and down but if you are over 80 years old
[2:37:20.540 --> 2:37:25.340]  and you've had surgery or whatever and you've got lung problems then yeah it's the grim reaper
[2:37:25.340 --> 2:37:32.140]  uh what are the other officers thinking k uh i see a lot of people that are on both sides i mean
[2:37:32.140 --> 2:37:37.820]  we obviously officers are overwhelming we support of a trump so they're just trying to say you know
[2:37:37.820 --> 2:37:42.460]  it's no big deal everybody's it's going to be fine it's all blown out of proportion which i'm
[2:37:42.460 --> 2:37:47.180]  i'm along with you on that note but there's just so many things we don't know about this at this
[2:37:47.180 --> 2:37:52.380]  point like what with what mike adams is saying i know you're right that's what makes it scary and
[2:37:52.380 --> 2:37:57.500]  trump knows it's coming so regardless of how bad it is no reason to panic and take the stock market
[2:37:57.500 --> 2:38:04.540]  and so he's really i think has a balancing act here totally understand that and i do appreciate
[2:38:04.540 --> 2:38:10.700]  what trump's been doing and just trying to appeal to to the people but at the same time make sure
[2:38:10.700 --> 2:38:16.060]  stuff doesn't completely collapse because i have kids i don't want that to happen well exactly and
[2:38:16.060 --> 2:38:19.980]  listen listen listen listen if we lost a million we lost over that the civil war back when our
[2:38:19.980 --> 2:38:24.860]  population was you know 20 percent of what it is now if we lost a million and don't panic about it
[2:38:24.860 --> 2:38:29.180]  it's sad you know it's not good but if you have a great depression you can pull up the university
[2:38:29.180 --> 2:38:35.660]  studies seven million pull up the articles university studies seven million starved death
[2:38:35.660 --> 2:38:42.620]  from malnutrition great depression seven million people in the ten-year great depression uh or
[2:38:42.620 --> 2:38:48.780]  eleven-year great depression ended up starved death they estimate so if the whole cult society collapses
[2:38:50.140 --> 2:38:55.900]  that is not good and the food's going to run out so again it's like where you get startled

[2:40:53.180 --> 2:40:58.460]  same thing but brother i couldn't sleep last night and literally paced the halls in the dark
[2:40:58.460 --> 2:41:02.940]  walking in and looking at my children as they slept trying to think of the slogan that's it
[2:41:02.940 --> 2:41:15.180]  covid-19 equals 1984 covid-19 equals 1984 on top a global 9 11 absolutely what else do you think
[2:41:15.980 --> 2:41:20.780]  alex i was at our first emergency operations center on the operations cabinet for the fire
[2:41:20.780 --> 2:41:27.100]  department here last night and last night as we were concluding our meeting i saw a high-level
[2:41:27.100 --> 2:41:33.180]  hospital employee packing up on a trailer large uh traffic cones like what you would see on the
[2:41:33.180 --> 2:41:38.540]  interstate and so i this isn't some low-level maintenance guy alex this is a high-level
[2:41:38.540 --> 2:41:44.460]  hospital official packing up large amounts of traffic cones from the emergency operations center
[2:41:44.460 --> 2:41:52.780]  to prepare to cordon off the parking lot for for kent hospitals in fact i read the article
[2:41:52.780 --> 2:41:57.980]  open a few weeks ago was already taking a few patients it's called the inmate labor park it's
[2:41:57.980 --> 2:42:01.980]  formerly a forced labor facility what's the name of the state park they're using the whole people
[2:42:01.980 --> 2:42:07.580]  now in georgia i don't know that's up in north georgia alex they've already said that they're
[2:42:07.580 --> 2:42:13.820]  building you know facilities there um southwest georgia has already issued their first uh
[2:42:14.780 --> 2:42:19.980]  shelter in place order but we know that's just a ruse for marshal law let me tell you what i saw
[2:42:19.980 --> 2:42:25.180]  i went down to port aransas to try to take some time off with the family and ended up coming back
[2:42:25.180 --> 2:42:31.420]  early and i'm driving in the fire department's got a checkpoint blocking the road with dump trucks
[2:42:31.420 --> 2:42:36.540]  it was clearly how you block a road and then the day we left the police were practicing
[2:42:37.100 --> 2:42:42.140]  blocking the road uh again at the city limits and blocking the island so yeah they're getting
[2:42:42.140 --> 2:42:47.180]  their orders to gear up but like you said it was when i was driving by it was all the higher level
[2:42:47.180 --> 2:42:52.380]  police just like you saw a hospital official they're not telling people under them but it doesn't
[2:42:52.380 --> 2:42:57.260]  matter because the orders on top are there one of the products that i'm very proud of i don't
[2:42:57.260 --> 2:43:03.500]  talk enough about because there's so many amazing essential oils and ingredients in it it takes a
[2:43:03.500 --> 2:43:08.540]  long time to break down the product because it's a complex product a lot of the sprays you put in

[2:43:22.140 --> 2:43:29.340]  oils and ingredients in it you take a few sprays in your mouth lightly inhale and it just does so

[2:43:54.780 --> 2:44:01.980]  info wars has had to suspend all new food sales because the supply chain has collapsed this is a
[2:44:01.980 --> 2:44:09.180]  system-wide problem and this country is facing a new depression unless trump and the american people
[2:44:09.180 --> 2:44:16.700]  work together to develop a plan to expose this globalist operation that's it people are calling
[2:44:16.700 --> 2:44:22.220]  and saying we wish you had the supplements in stock we wish that wasn't sold out they've confused
[2:44:22.220 --> 2:44:30.540]  that with the food everything we advertise everything we sell we have in the stock and we are only
[2:44:30.540 --> 2:44:35.900]  one day behind in shipping that means if you order on a monday it's shipping out on a wednesday
[2:44:35.900 --> 2:44:42.220]  and that's just as of today most days we are up to the day shipping meaning you order that day in
[2:44:42.220 --> 2:44:49.580]  the morning a lot of times it ships out that afternoon we have everything in stock that is
[2:44:49.580 --> 2:44:57.740]  so good to boost your overall defense against what's going on it's been the globalist the chai
[2:44:57.740 --> 2:45:05.740]  comms and democrats that they control that have been pushing for coronavirus hysteria and suspension
[2:45:05.740 --> 2:45:14.780]  of basic rights for the last eight weeks and now governor newson has come out publicly and said
[2:45:15.420 --> 2:45:22.220]  they're ready to declare martial law well that's a word game when you tell 40 million people they
[2:45:22.220 --> 2:45:28.300]  can't leave their houses period and you scare monger and say that almost 60 percent of the
[2:45:28.300 --> 2:45:35.420]  population will have it in just six weeks you're engaged in psychological warfare and you've already
[2:45:35.420 --> 2:45:43.180]  declared martial law about a seven on a one to ten rick or scale get ready folks the democrats
[2:45:43.180 --> 2:45:50.540]  just like the chai comms are setting the bar for martial law full on secret arrest fema camps you
[2:45:50.540 --> 2:45:57.260]  name it but the homeless and illegal aliens are all exempt we've all heard of the strike
[2:45:58.140 --> 2:46:03.660]  it's a socialist of communist tactic but sometimes populist movements have used the strike
[2:46:03.660 --> 2:46:10.380]  like you can have labor strikes you can have people that also boycott and refuse to use a company
[2:46:10.380 --> 2:46:16.300]  or a service and many times when the people actually get together and move and master the strike it
[2:46:16.300 --> 2:46:24.940]  has a great effect and some good things have come out of it but now we are seeing a globalist
[2:46:24.940 --> 2:46:33.020]  corporate strike by shutting down key institutions at key times led by big tech over a month ago
[2:46:33.020 --> 2:46:39.100]  to then set the precedent to shut down small companies and businesses across the world but
[2:46:39.100 --> 2:46:47.260]  notice the big globalist corporations in the big box stores they are all exempt this is more than
[2:46:47.260 --> 2:46:51.580]  just martial law training this is the globalist trying to create a worldwide depression they
[2:46:51.580 --> 2:47:05.660]  can blame on trump and they even admit they're doing it you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:15.180 --> 2:47:19.260]  we are back live gonna finish up with a wezzly and then we're gonna have jacob engels pop in with
[2:47:19.260 --> 2:47:23.260]  some big breaking news investigative paternalists and then we go back to your calls and mike adams
[2:47:23.260 --> 2:47:27.740]  let me join us for the last 45 minutes of the next hour with a lot of important information
[2:47:29.500 --> 2:47:34.700]  jacob engels has broken a bunch of huge news we'll talk to him in just a second but wezzly and
[2:47:34.700 --> 2:47:39.420]  georgia a firefighter i looked up the name of the park they're now using to put two people they've
[2:47:39.420 --> 2:47:46.460]  had in georgia that have it and it's a hard labor creek state park in morgan county a former area
[2:47:46.460 --> 2:47:51.500]  where they use prison labor to cut granite so that just shows you what's going on so so all
[2:47:51.500 --> 2:47:55.660]  this is really being set up i just wanted to hear what the first responders are being told
[2:47:55.660 --> 2:47:59.420]  and what i've seen out there first responders aren't being told a lot that's not good
[2:48:01.820 --> 2:48:07.420]  that's right alex i've got one more major point do you remember the los vegas shooting
[2:48:07.980 --> 2:48:15.820]  back in october 17 i guess i do okay if you remember trump banned bump stocks after that
[2:48:15.820 --> 2:48:22.700]  that went into effect in march of 19 and then we started learning the cdc started hiring in
[2:48:22.700 --> 2:48:28.140]  november of 19 off for all these quarantine officers so it's all connected alex because
[2:48:28.140 --> 2:48:36.220]  they didn't want you to be able to get bump stocks to to prepare for the marshal law well i know this
[2:48:36.220 --> 2:48:40.060]  this country is in a fight for its very future the president's surrounded by people that want to
[2:48:40.060 --> 2:48:43.980]  prevent his policies he didn't want to push it at all this they're forcing him to and i'm not
[2:48:43.980 --> 2:48:48.140]  defending what's happening i think it's uh you know out of control but i get that the president
[2:48:48.940 --> 2:48:54.380]  has to sit there the way the public's been domesticated and and hand ring and you know
[2:48:55.260 --> 2:48:59.740]  go along with whatever the leftists are pushing in their cities or it looks like he hasn't
[2:49:00.300 --> 2:49:04.700]  adequately responded and that's quite a trap he tried to speak to the public and say hey
[2:49:05.340 --> 2:49:10.860]  this happens it's part of life uh we're working on it we don't know how deadly it is but
[2:49:10.860 --> 2:49:16.060]  but they were able to get political shots in there and i said trump do something well now
[2:49:16.060 --> 2:49:21.580]  here we are so uh this this this is the globalist ultimate weapon is a bioweapon attack
[2:49:21.580 --> 2:49:26.540]  in total hysteria god bless you wezzly all right we had a federal officer almost been
[2:49:26.540 --> 2:49:30.380]  full but they got cold feet and hung up you're not giving out the secret information we've
[2:49:30.380 --> 2:49:34.300]  already in a form of martial law by the corporations by the democrats in their areas
[2:49:35.100 --> 2:49:38.140]  stampeding republicans and they're going along with it or they'll be saddled with the
[2:49:38.140 --> 2:49:43.020]  deaths from the virus and even the media is taking the the chinese off the name of it call
[2:49:43.020 --> 2:49:48.380]  it the trump virus now okay joining us is jacob engels investigative journalist
[2:49:49.340 --> 2:49:54.940]  central four to post.com he also writes for gateway punnett.com and infowars.com and man
[2:49:54.940 --> 2:50:00.300]  has he been knocking it out of the park photos appear to show naked andrew gillum
[2:50:02.140 --> 2:50:06.780]  on vomit covered towels but he didn't get in trouble at a reported meth party but that's a
[2:50:06.780 --> 2:50:13.020]  side issue uh the big one is another individual involved the roger stone show trial is a democrat
[2:50:13.020 --> 2:50:18.300]  party operative so the first four woman worked for obama headed up an agency or husband worked
[2:50:18.300 --> 2:50:23.660]  on the robert meuller report total conflict of interest textbook and the new one was a democratic
[2:50:23.660 --> 2:50:29.100]  party operative ran for national office a protege of uh donald brazil and then we she tried to keep
[2:50:29.100 --> 2:50:33.340]  the other name secret but as they find out more of their names and find out people connected to
[2:50:33.340 --> 2:50:37.900]  the trial it's a bunch of democratic party operatives so give us the latest on your excellent
[2:50:38.460 --> 2:50:45.260]  gateway punnett article absolutely alex so we discovered that the court appointed attorney
[2:50:45.260 --> 2:50:51.900]  for the jurors the corrupt jurors is actually connected to the lead jury four woman tomica
[2:50:51.900 --> 2:50:57.500]  heart they served on the same board of the center for american democracy and technology a clear
[2:50:57.500 --> 2:51:06.220]  conflict of interest yet judge amy berman jackson allowed it to happen yet again and again this is
[2:51:06.220 --> 2:51:11.420]  bombshell i've talked to a bunch of lawyers they've never heard of a judge appointing a lawyer for
[2:51:11.420 --> 2:51:16.140]  former jurors jurors are supposed to be public especially after a trial she's trying to hide it
[2:51:16.140 --> 2:51:25.500]  and now tell us who the individual is the individual is uh sydney uh ral or alan c ral uh my bad with
[2:51:25.500 --> 2:51:33.820]  sydney austin llp a white shoe law firm out of dc he is a leftist he is somebody who has had contact
[2:51:33.820 --> 2:51:41.180]  with tomica heart the lead jury four woman who has had anti trump anti stone anti jones posts
[2:51:41.180 --> 2:51:47.740]  on her social media accounts she is corrupt and it seems as if judge amy when she was reviewing
[2:51:47.740 --> 2:51:56.620]  who to appoint for the jurors called up tomica heart and said tomica do you have any friends
[2:51:56.620 --> 2:52:00.780]  there he is on screen right there there's a computer malfunction putting a bar over his
[2:52:00.780 --> 2:52:06.620]  face but but click on that guy's and get his actual photo of alan charles ral uh this is just
[2:52:06.620 --> 2:52:13.340]  amazing democrat party operative as their lawyer how am i not surprised yeah and it's really
[2:52:13.340 --> 2:52:20.780]  concerning alex what is wrong with this judiciary system it's supposed to be justice is blind in
[2:52:20.780 --> 2:52:25.420]  this country but if you're a conservative you're a trump supporter if you're an info wars listener
[2:52:25.420 --> 2:52:31.980]  you do not deserve fairness you do not deserve true justice you deserve a kangaroo court something
[2:52:31.980 --> 2:52:41.340]  that hitler would be proud of sad to say it but it's true well it just amazes me how she's trying
[2:52:41.340 --> 2:52:45.180]  to keep the names the other jurors secret because we know they're going to all turn out to be democrat
[2:52:45.180 --> 2:52:52.460]  party operatives yeah and there's not one single juror let's let's just make the bet right now alex
[2:52:52.460 --> 2:52:57.500]  uh i owe you dinner at eddie v's if i'm wrong let's make the bet right now that not one single juror
[2:52:57.500 --> 2:53:04.860]  or alternate juror is a republican and independent even green party even a libertarian we know the
[2:53:04.860 --> 2:53:11.260]  game we know the fix and the fix was in from the beginning for roger well if folks want to read the
[2:53:11.260 --> 2:53:15.660]  gateway pun in article we've got a link to our info wars dot com we'll put it back on screen
[2:53:15.660 --> 2:53:22.060]  folks need to go see the stunning corrupt roger stone jury foreman is connected to court appointed
[2:53:22.060 --> 2:53:29.660]  lawyer and that's a powerful headline but i would just say stunning corrupt roger stone democrat
[2:53:29.660 --> 2:53:37.580]  party operative that's too long corrupt roger stone jury forewoman uh is protected by democrat
[2:53:37.580 --> 2:53:43.660]  party operative lawyer i mean it's just it's just it's just too over the top we've got to learn those
[2:53:43.660 --> 2:53:49.020]  other names not to tamper with the jury the jury's over but to show i mean some of them one of the
[2:53:49.020 --> 2:53:53.980]  other guys went and wrote an op-ed for the washington post how bad roger wasn't how good they are and
[2:53:53.980 --> 2:53:58.300]  how wonderful the democrats are i mean they've got all their speech but roger stone doesn't have his
[2:53:59.500 --> 2:54:04.700]  no seth cousins let's say his name seth cousins he went to the washington post he wrote an article
[2:54:04.700 --> 2:54:10.300]  for them talking about how fair the jury process was talking about how wonderful judge amy berman
[2:54:10.300 --> 2:54:15.980]  jackson was and alex one interesting point in his article that he mentioned that i found quite weird
[2:54:15.980 --> 2:54:22.700]  he felt the needs tell people that judge amy never came into our our area judge amy never interacted
[2:54:22.700 --> 2:54:27.020]  with the jurors that's like a little kid saying no mom i didn't take the cookies after they just
[2:54:27.020 --> 2:54:32.380]  gotten caught taking the cookies this judge needs to be reviewed immediately and it's the same process
[2:54:32.380 --> 2:54:37.100]  for the president for federal judges she should be impeached she should be tried and she should be
[2:54:37.100 --> 2:54:43.260]  stripped of her robe and ostracized from the legal community and shamed throughout this country
[2:54:43.260 --> 2:54:48.220]  that's right very dangerous federal tyranny and that's why it's well known that they have
[2:54:48.220 --> 2:54:53.180]  got federal judges out to lynch me as best they can that are democrat party operatives and this is
[2:54:53.180 --> 2:54:58.540]  the tyranny they've seen it before jacob engels i wanted to have you on happy birthday by the way
[2:54:58.540 --> 2:55:02.220]  i wanted to have you on because you're a great journalist you've been through a lot uh you
[2:55:02.220 --> 2:55:06.380]  got persecuted for telling the truth and being one of the first to expose uh in fact the first
[2:55:06.380 --> 2:55:11.740]  expose what was going on here on this show with the jurors under serious threats uh and this is
[2:55:11.740 --> 2:55:15.260]  a threat to us all there's huge news of the coronavirus all this giant stuff happening
[2:55:15.900 --> 2:55:19.980]  but what's happening to rogers happening to us all and i said watch i bet she doesn't sit in
[2:55:19.980 --> 2:55:24.140]  the jail right away like she said in two weeks because she always does the opposite i said
[2:55:24.140 --> 2:55:28.140]  they're waiting till they try to remove trump again with the next hoax and of course that's
[2:55:28.140 --> 2:55:33.580]  coronavirus i'm saying the virus itself so hoax but the hysteria is uh and then they'll try to
[2:55:33.580 --> 2:55:37.420]  do that because they just keep getting more desperate as they try to push things into the
[2:55:37.420 --> 2:55:41.100]  future but it's not working for them we're about to go to break i'm gonna let you go i appreciate
[2:55:41.100 --> 2:55:46.940]  the time but briefly what's your snapshot on the coronavirus and what's going on well alex i think
[2:55:46.940 --> 2:55:52.300]  you put the nail on the head it's it is something that's concerning it should concern us all but
[2:55:52.300 --> 2:55:57.340]  what is more concerning the idea that we're going to catch it and infect somebody else or the idea
[2:55:57.340 --> 2:56:01.820]  that the hysteria is going to whip people up into such a frenzy that we're going to start
[2:56:01.820 --> 2:56:07.100]  arming one another they that's what they want they want us to be in this mindset that the end
[2:56:07.100 --> 2:56:13.740]  of the world is coming and i see it at the grocery store i see it uh out in uh the streets of
[2:56:13.740 --> 2:56:19.260]  orlando here people are not treating each other with respect and kindness as fellow humans people
[2:56:19.260 --> 2:56:23.820]  are shoving and pushing in the grocery store fighting over walmart brand toilet paper i don't
[2:56:23.820 --> 2:56:28.940]  think i would even use that if it were the apocalypse uh and they are not realizing how they
[2:56:28.940 --> 2:56:34.140]  should behave as humans and all of that is media corporate media generated hysteria you should
[2:56:34.140 --> 2:56:41.180]  be prepared at any time for three to six months of not going to the store food water medical supplies
[2:56:41.180 --> 2:56:46.060]  that's why it's so important when we watch info wars when we watch other shows you provide people
[2:56:46.060 --> 2:56:51.260]  with the tools for success and oftentimes we don't think it's serious enough well now it's serious
[2:56:51.260 --> 2:56:55.500]  enough and what kind of situation have you found yourself and you're the ones that predicted where
[2:56:55.500 --> 2:57:00.300]  it was all going and how it would unfold and said get ready and again we're the bad guys so the word
[2:57:00.300 --> 2:57:04.300]  of mouth getting the truth out right now that it came from china that it's a man-made weapon that
[2:57:04.300 --> 2:57:07.900]  it's meant to hurt our economy that china's already turned back on but we're supposed to be shut down
[2:57:07.900 --> 2:57:13.100]  for 18 months this is the globalist move jake of engels thank you so much we're going to go to
[2:57:13.100 --> 2:57:17.420]  break and i promise we're going right to greg and right to truth her on the other side as we start
[2:57:17.420 --> 2:57:22.540]  the fourth hour and then like adam's scheduled at 15 after joining us he's got a lot to cover as
[2:57:22.540 --> 2:57:28.300]  well but make no mistake we predicted the total hysteria the attack on trump the attempt to
[2:57:28.300 --> 2:57:33.180]  bring down the economy and it's happening now what's coming next we'll put our heads together and
[2:57:33.180 --> 2:57:39.020]  talk to greg who's a paramedic in oklahoma and about on the virus and truth her a medical worker

[2:57:49.180 --> 2:57:56.460]  sweden the list goes on and on they've all declared martial law and said that if you leave your house
[2:57:56.460 --> 2:58:02.700]  without authorization you'll be put in jail for up to six months but they've been releasing
[2:58:02.700 --> 2:58:10.540]  by the tens of thousands per country the hardened criminals the rapists and murderers and car thieves
[2:58:10.540 --> 2:58:16.860]  and home invaders and it's the same thing in democrat run cesspit blue cities here as well
[2:58:16.860 --> 2:58:23.020]  tens of thousands released and now governor newson says he may declare martial law and has
[2:58:23.020 --> 2:58:28.700]  already ordered 40 million people in california to stay in their houses or six months in jail
[2:58:28.700 --> 2:58:36.060]  but publicly stated illegal aliens islamic invaders so-called migrants and of course the
[2:58:36.060 --> 2:58:42.860]  homeless are all exempt i'm not getting look it up welcome to slavery they think they own you and
[2:58:42.860 --> 2:58:49.980]  now they're about to show you the noose is tightening around america's neck the supply chains have

[3:00:09.580 --> 3:00:14.700]  really bad but there's another big study out that china overstated the severity of the virus and
[3:00:14.700 --> 3:00:20.060]  used it for political control so again i'm not denying this virus is you know hurts the people
[3:00:20.060 --> 3:00:24.540]  who kill a lot of folks it's bad but the way the globalists are using is going to kill the economy
[3:00:25.740 --> 3:00:29.820]  truther clark greg philip we're going to get to all of you ahead of mike adams
[3:00:29.820 --> 3:00:37.340]  also kyle one of the great producers in there and who runs the switcher uh is uh which is a brave
[3:00:37.340 --> 3:00:43.900]  job when it's a cheap uh tricaster like we have uh it's like flying a space shuttle with a tinker
[3:00:43.900 --> 3:00:48.940]  toy uh but he he wants to pop it and talk about what he's saying he's a smart cookie uh but let's go
[3:00:48.940 --> 3:00:58.140]  ahead and talk to clark in denver wife is nurse manager for major hospital says it's at capacity
[3:00:58.140 --> 3:01:05.340]  tell us what you're saying hi thanks for taking my call alex so i'm not trying to panic anyone
[3:01:05.340 --> 3:01:12.300]  it's it's been at capacity for two months they've had hallway bed and really sick patients she's
[3:01:12.300 --> 3:01:17.820]  around the most vulnerable of our population heart disease elderly people people with serious
[3:01:17.820 --> 3:01:26.940]  illnesses and uh i asked her 10 weeks ago i said they tell you about this virus no okay eight weeks
[3:01:26.940 --> 3:01:32.940]  ago they tell you they say anything no and then about six weeks ago i'm sitting around the table
[3:01:32.940 --> 3:01:38.780]  with her and her brother who's a physician and his wife is a physician and i ask all three of them
[3:01:38.780 --> 3:01:44.140]  and they're like oh that's just a cold that's no big deal that's hype and i so then i asked my wife
[3:01:44.140 --> 3:01:49.260]  i said what are you going to do when this institution that supposedly has your best interest
[3:01:49.260 --> 3:01:53.660]  in mind tells you all of a sudden that you need to worry about this and that's a problem and you
[3:01:53.660 --> 3:01:58.540]  know what they rolled it out the same day they rolled it out the entire country last wednesday
[3:01:58.540 --> 3:02:05.660]  and the panic that ensued wasn't it wasn't natural it was the employees it was the employees and the
[3:02:05.660 --> 3:02:10.780]  patients who started the panic by the way that's what steve pacinic said and and i mean he was gone
[3:02:10.780 --> 3:02:15.580]  for like three months and couldn't come on and then the next thing was on i told daria i said man
[3:02:15.580 --> 3:02:20.220]  does he have cancer or something looks like he's 20 years older he looks better now he almost died
[3:02:20.220 --> 3:02:23.980]  and believes he got it because he was working with a chinese student he's involved in obviously a lot
[3:02:23.980 --> 3:02:30.460]  of stuff as a famous master spy uh and he goes to north korea i mean to north korea on a regular
[3:02:30.460 --> 3:02:36.220]  basis i'm just gonna leave it at that he's actually a but the point is is that when he said that people
[3:02:36.220 --> 3:02:40.380]  like oh yeah right but now we're learning it's been here since at least last november and that's
[3:02:40.380 --> 3:02:47.340]  why we know now the cdc massively increased secret preparations for quarantines in november uh but
[3:02:47.340 --> 3:02:50.940]  you better believe they didn't tell the president they keep so much stuff and i'm not just defending
[3:02:50.940 --> 3:02:56.540]  the president they keep him not appraised of stuff so they can make him look bad that's been confirmed
[3:02:58.140 --> 3:03:03.820]  two more quick points you you you had an epiphany with that covid 1984 but you missed it just a
[3:03:03.820 --> 3:03:09.820]  little bit it means covid 1984 and one other thing i think it's real rich that we've got a
[3:03:09.820 --> 3:03:17.020]  bunch of liberal pro-choicers shitting people into conduct to save the most vulnerable among us i'm out
[3:03:19.020 --> 3:03:23.980]  well brother all i can say is god bless you and god bless your wife that works at this hospital
[3:03:24.940 --> 3:03:29.740]  and i just please call me back with updates because we're going to open the phones up
[3:03:29.740 --> 3:03:35.740]  every day now in a certain time for medical workers police military first responders
[3:03:35.740 --> 3:03:38.300]  to have a chance to call in and tell us what they see happening all right we're going to break
[3:03:38.300 --> 3:03:43.500]  in a moment i don't want to cut you short so uh pruther and greg we're going to take your calls
[3:03:44.780 --> 3:03:49.660]  and we're also going to have kyle pop in with what he saw now here's the deal
[3:03:52.140 --> 3:03:58.220]  it is the concerted rollout of the pr between the eu the chai comms the democrats and the deep
[3:03:58.220 --> 3:04:04.220]  state that told me seven weeks ago this is going to be horrible i said i don't know how deadly it
[3:04:04.220 --> 3:04:10.700]  is but i said the response is going to be hysterical it's like the spanish flu um
[3:04:11.260 --> 3:04:16.060]  they killed 50 million people or whatever the number is you only say 30 to 80 no one knows
[3:04:17.260 --> 3:04:22.620]  it wasn't the virus killed you your body would have an autoimmune response to it so strong
[3:04:22.620 --> 3:04:29.500]  it'd feel full of liquid when you die and 600 plus thousand americans died and the fact this is
[3:04:29.500 --> 3:04:35.820]  man-made you know again but is it man-made and weak they made it so they know how to mutate
[3:04:35.820 --> 3:04:39.740]  or does it mutate to something worse or does it burn itself out there's a lot of variables here
[3:04:39.740 --> 3:04:45.820]  but everybody gets it now this is serious and it's everything we predicted global government
[3:04:45.820 --> 3:04:50.620]  trying to dominate the nation state the individual through fear with a man-made bio weapon
[3:04:50.620 --> 3:05:03.740]  the noose is tightening incrementally america is being put into hard core martial law the globalists
[3:05:03.740 --> 3:05:09.420]  have already economically closed the noose around our neck and they're now saying it's not going to
[3:05:09.420 --> 3:05:14.540]  be two weeks or a month or three months but 18 months bringing us into the greatest oppression
[3:05:14.540 --> 3:05:20.780]  the planet's ever seen china says everything's fine now and they're back to business they launched
[3:05:20.780 --> 3:05:29.180]  their hysteria they triggered the insanity america took the bait and now we're going down unless
[3:05:29.180 --> 3:05:34.460]  humanity awakens and understands the virus is man-made and understands that these restrictions
[3:05:34.460 --> 3:05:40.140]  overall are not being used to protect us from the virus but are being used to set the precedent
[3:05:40.140 --> 3:05:46.700]  for a giant controlled system and permanent martial law that will be used to overthrow
[3:05:46.700 --> 3:05:53.020]  trump and bring in pure globalist tyranny this is the battle for the republic happening now
[3:06:00.780 --> 3:06:07.020]  devastating globalist lies exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine
[3:06:07.020 --> 3:06:14.700]  tirelessly waging war on corruption from deep in the heart of fema region six in austin texas
[3:06:15.260 --> 3:06:23.740]  transmitting worldwide it's alex jones if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:06:31.740 --> 3:06:36.380]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen we have some video that just came out was just posted info
[3:06:36.380 --> 3:06:40.300]  wars dot com and news wars dot com if you're a radio listener want to go see it team of
[3:06:40.300 --> 3:06:45.660]  viewers we're about to play at a woman shoots video at fedex stadium in maryland just miles from
[3:06:45.660 --> 3:06:51.980]  the dc border of the national guards setting up an emergency center obviously for people that are
[3:06:51.980 --> 3:06:56.940]  and end up having it we have the exclusive photos inside the k bailey hutchinson convention center
[3:06:56.940 --> 3:07:01.420]  the largest in the dallas fort worth metro plex showing where they are putting up hundreds and
[3:07:01.420 --> 3:07:08.220]  hundreds of beds inside of the facility so that article with those exclusive photos is also up
[3:07:08.220 --> 3:07:13.420]  on info wars dot com so the government's taking this very serious and is gearing up for something
[3:07:13.420 --> 3:07:19.420]  big mike adams joins us next segment and unfortunately more and more of what he said looks
[3:07:19.420 --> 3:07:24.620]  like it's being vindicated so we were looking at all sides of this we had ted newton his wife on
[3:07:24.620 --> 3:07:28.860]  earlier they're being pretty positive about it but we've all got front row seats to this right now
[3:07:28.860 --> 3:07:35.180]  uh let's go ahead and talk to truther who's a medical worker uh clinics in california during
[3:07:35.180 --> 3:07:38.940]  lockdown the governor has basically put you under martial law 40 million people are told
[3:07:38.940 --> 3:07:43.740]  to leave their homes unless for essential things uh and the reporter goes well why don't you just do
[3:07:43.740 --> 3:07:48.540]  martial law and he goes it's a subtlety honey we are under martial law played that clip already
[3:07:48.540 --> 3:07:55.420]  three times earlier uh truther thanks for calling thanks for holding hey alex uh this is uh east bay
[3:07:55.420 --> 3:08:02.460]  truther calling from uh fema region nine here in california um i'm a medical clinic worker
[3:08:02.460 --> 3:08:10.780]  and uh i'm mobile so um even though they have this quote unquote uh statewide lockdown uh
[3:08:10.780 --> 3:08:16.540]  we're still out and about and uh i'm keeping my uh keeping my eyes open and then just see what's
[3:08:16.540 --> 3:08:26.540]  going on what do you think is going on you know i think uh they're not letting the crisis go to
[3:08:26.540 --> 3:08:34.460]  waste and uh they already have everybody under the uh impression that this is like ebola here in
[3:08:34.460 --> 3:08:42.620]  california uh the the shelves are being emptied out uh many of the supermarkets um so in my in
[3:08:42.620 --> 3:08:49.900]  my day-to-day duties uh i service clinics all over the bay from uh the north bay uh to the east bay
[3:08:51.020 --> 3:08:55.020]  luckily i don't have to go into san francisco but every once in a while i am dispatched in
[3:08:55.020 --> 3:09:01.020]  of the city uh but so far it's been uh food selling on the highways that i will say uh
[3:09:01.020 --> 3:09:07.100]  traffic is basically non-existent uh yesterday driving home during rush hour it was like a ghost
[3:09:07.100 --> 3:09:13.820]  town on the 580 uh that's one of the major intersections here in the uh east bay and um i
[3:09:13.820 --> 3:09:20.380]  think the fear is uh uh paralyzing people right now i agree when i looked at gavin newson i watched
[3:09:20.380 --> 3:09:26.300]  the whole or most of the hour 15 i skipped ahead a few times finding the marshal law club i watched
[3:09:26.300 --> 3:09:31.020]  he was like gleeful and i thought he he's acting so gleeful let me go watch other videos of him
[3:09:31.020 --> 3:09:37.660]  he doesn't usually act that gleeful and his staff they are loving this power grab as their state
[3:09:37.660 --> 3:09:43.820]  falls apart as there's feces and drugs everywhere and fentanyl deaths and the man just looks like
[3:09:43.820 --> 3:09:49.180]  what the american psycho played by christian bale wish he did i mean the guy is so disingenuous
[3:09:49.180 --> 3:09:56.220]  so creepy he makes my skin crawl and then he's up there just licking his lips yeah he he needs
[3:09:56.220 --> 3:10:01.820]  to be called for impeachment i mean uh you know there's an argument going on right now
[3:10:01.820 --> 3:10:07.020]  that uh the first amendment right to a sample is more important than a quarantine and a lockdown
[3:10:07.020 --> 3:10:13.900]  his his executive order i believe it was uh an 33-20 california state code or whatnot
[3:10:13.900 --> 3:10:20.140]  and uh i'm i'm questioning the constitutionality of this well absolutely because under this
[3:10:20.140 --> 3:10:26.540]  thing look england and europe's already done it and it's now coming here six weeks they grab you
[3:10:26.540 --> 3:10:31.340]  to see if the virus pops up when it's 14 days so it's a global standardization and at that point
[3:10:31.340 --> 3:10:37.100]  folks it's time for civil disobedience this is us learning how to be slaves god bless you truther
[3:10:37.660 --> 3:10:42.380]  stay with us uh greg we're gonna go to you in a moment and then get one of our crews take
[3:10:42.380 --> 3:10:47.740]  but here's the footage from fedex stadium shot today of the national guard massing
[3:10:47.740 --> 3:10:58.140]  so everyone i am live right now this is crazy i'm at live right now i mean i'm live right
[3:10:58.140 --> 3:11:06.140]  now at fedex field this is what's going on they have the military setting up for this quarantine
[3:11:06.140 --> 3:11:21.820]  they're not playing games omg this is crazy these military trucks are here this is where they will
[3:11:21.820 --> 3:11:29.420]  be stationed and they're not playing game show okay so there you go folks uh this thing killed
[3:11:29.420 --> 3:11:34.060]  less than four thousand they claim in china it's over that now uh are getting close to that in
[3:11:34.060 --> 3:11:40.300]  idly okay and we're told it burned out it peaked there because they locked down no they didn't
[3:11:40.300 --> 3:11:46.540]  woonan was over eight million people five million ran during the thing they ran all over the world so
[3:11:46.540 --> 3:11:56.540]  again this didn't make sense to me uh let's go ahead and go to one of our great producers in there
[3:11:56.540 --> 3:12:03.820]  around the board kyle kyle uh what did you witness yesterday and today and what do you
[3:12:03.820 --> 3:12:10.540]  think's going on yeah alex uh so about a few weeks ago my gut was telling me that this was all a
[3:12:10.540 --> 3:12:17.340]  white coat operation of medical tyranny um the globalist trying to take back power and uh to
[3:12:17.340 --> 3:12:24.220]  regain control however my head was taken just a moment to catch back up to my gut until yesterday
[3:12:24.220 --> 3:12:30.620]  when i was at my apartment complex i happened to witness a woman about the age of about 75
[3:12:30.620 --> 3:12:37.420]  uh hispanic woman being taken out of her apartment on a stretcher and uh as she was coming out of the
[3:12:37.420 --> 3:12:43.180]  out of the apartment i happened to notice that the three emt's who were taking her out
[3:12:43.180 --> 3:12:50.380]  not a single one of them had a face mask on and given yes this woman could have had any ailment
[3:12:50.380 --> 3:12:56.300]  non related to coronavirus but you would think in such a time of panic and pandemic
[3:12:56.940 --> 3:13:02.700]  that um the emt's would take care of their own safety by wearing face masks that's right if we're
[3:13:02.700 --> 3:13:08.460]  being told you can't go outside your house and you can't assemble and you can't we're gonna you
[3:13:08.460 --> 3:13:12.940]  can't buy guns you can't you know do any of this anymore then why all over the country
[3:13:12.940 --> 3:13:17.740]  are the hospital staff not doing because they haven't been told to yet because the cdc ship
[3:13:17.740 --> 3:13:22.220]  people in that had it dumped them out on purpose that's now confirmed in san antonio news we broke
[3:13:22.220 --> 3:13:29.340]  it a month ago and let it incubate as an attack on america that is what is going on here and and
[3:13:29.340 --> 3:13:35.580]  so either it's it's a hoax almost you know and pretty much a fake virus or the system is deliberately
[3:13:35.580 --> 3:13:41.100]  spreading it so when it gets bad they can take all our rights what do you think i personally think
[3:13:41.100 --> 3:13:47.900]  that um some of these cases may potentially just be the flu and other potential deaths that are
[3:13:47.900 --> 3:13:52.140]  taking place yeah there's old people by the thousands every week dying of stuff when they're
[3:13:52.140 --> 3:13:57.100]  old that's why i've studied here 99 percent of patients killed by coronavirus in italy
[3:13:57.100 --> 3:14:05.260]  had existing issues and the average age was 85 now yeah i see this as a last last stitch effort
[3:14:05.260 --> 3:14:10.860]  for the white coats and for medical tyranny to try and push their vaccinations on us for bill
[3:14:10.860 --> 3:14:17.420]  gates and others to try and push this digital id on us and uh to try and regain control from the
[3:14:17.420 --> 3:14:23.260]  people during a time where we were clearly taking it back and we need to put our feet down now
[3:14:23.260 --> 3:14:28.300]  and stop them at well you're definitely right that they're using it for power regardless of
[3:14:28.300 --> 3:14:33.180]  how deadly the virus is and uh that they are licking their lips thank you so much for the great
[3:14:33.180 --> 3:14:38.300]  point let's jam in one more call and we'll continue but my cabs is coming up uh let's go ahead and
[3:14:38.300 --> 3:14:47.420]  talk to greg and oklahoma thanks for calling a paramedic hello yes sir yes sir mr jones it's a
[3:14:47.420 --> 3:14:53.500]  pleasure to speak with you so i work on both sides of the country i'm not your normal paramedic
[3:14:53.500 --> 3:14:59.100]  i've been at this quite a while so coming from oklahoma we are highly unprepared for this
[3:14:59.740 --> 3:15:05.740]  and that is by design so mike adams is one of the smartest guys i've ever listened to but there's
[3:15:05.740 --> 3:15:12.700]  only one thing that he's that he's wrong about it is true that we have approximately a million beds
[3:15:12.700 --> 3:15:19.580]  that are corporate ran medical facility hospitals or whatever uh he said a while back they keep
[3:15:19.580 --> 3:15:25.340]  her right around about 200 200 000 those open that's not correct they run these hospitals
[3:15:25.900 --> 3:15:32.700]  at the maximum amount so whenever something like this happens the military will automatically step
[3:15:32.700 --> 3:15:39.260]  in they keep a lot of these beds full with low acuity patients on purpose so basically these big
[3:15:39.260 --> 3:15:45.820]  hospital they're not making money if they're not full so hold on you're gonna get a chance i don't
[3:15:45.820 --> 3:15:49.660]  want to hang up on you mike should come on for a segment and then i'll go to your call go to

[3:20:15.820 --> 3:20:22.460]  the governor of california said we don't need to call it marcia law it's it's just a subtle word
[3:20:22.460 --> 3:20:31.020]  game we're already under martial law so that's where we are right now we've got the different
[3:20:31.020 --> 3:20:36.220]  definitions of martial law here that i'll be going over but never forget who's running all this in
[3:20:36.220 --> 3:20:42.940]  the background the whole system the disease x furmanger from the un and the tabletop exercise
[3:20:42.940 --> 3:20:49.100]  was 65 million four months ago and then the virus patented and ready for a vaccine in the
[3:20:49.100 --> 3:20:56.140]  background bill gates here's what he had to say about your grandma the pranoff society is making
[3:20:56.140 --> 3:21:03.340]  because of very very high medical costs and a lack of willingness to say you know is spending a
[3:21:03.340 --> 3:21:09.100]  million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient would it be better not to lay off
[3:21:09.100 --> 3:21:15.900]  the those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs but that's called the death panel
[3:21:16.700 --> 3:21:21.340]  and you're not supposed to have that discussion so what you're about to see whether it's 10,000
[3:21:21.340 --> 3:21:28.700]  or 200,000 the guy is triaging they're gonna have bioethics boards and decide not to give old people
[3:21:30.220 --> 3:21:33.980]  any treatment and then it's where you ever a smoker and i could england they're saying if
[3:21:33.980 --> 3:21:38.780]  you're a racist we're not gonna be healthcare so mike adams is here hadn't been on a couple
[3:21:38.780 --> 3:21:43.660]  days well let's appreciate him coming on to give us on this friday edition his take on all these
[3:21:43.660 --> 3:21:47.500]  big developments i'm glad he did a story yesterday about what we've talked about for weeks and it
[3:21:47.500 --> 3:21:52.540]  didn't get the attention the cdc was hiring all these people for a quarantine in november
[3:21:53.420 --> 3:21:57.660]  they were bringing them in mike and i covered this four or five weeks ago to san antonio
[3:21:57.660 --> 3:22:03.580]  and and and turning people loose they knew had it so it's pretty clear here that this is a deep
[3:22:03.580 --> 3:22:10.380]  state operation question is what does trump do uh and so with all the developments is mike
[3:22:10.380 --> 3:22:13.660]  adams natural news dot com mike good to have you here with us where do you want to start first
[3:22:14.220 --> 3:22:18.620]  well thank you alex it's great to be back with you and i'm sorry about the delays i am planting
[3:22:18.620 --> 3:22:24.460]  potatoes and hatching baby chicks in incubators because i believe we need to be thinking about
[3:22:24.460 --> 3:22:29.820]  using our stored food to bridge into self-reliance of food production that's how serious i believe
[3:22:29.820 --> 3:22:35.260]  this is oh they're saying 18 months now that in three months it'll be a depression yeah yeah and
[3:22:35.260 --> 3:22:40.540]  and if if you're not thinking about producing food at some level in order to augment your existing
[3:22:40.540 --> 3:22:45.340]  food supplies then then i don't think you're you know anybody doing that as well prepared look
[3:22:45.340 --> 3:22:50.780]  the food supply lines are collapsing the the extra buffer that was in the food distributors the grain
[3:22:50.780 --> 3:22:56.140]  processors and even farming is now gone the excesses are gone the store shelves will not be
[3:22:56.140 --> 3:23:00.780]  restocked at the levels that you have seen for the last two weeks that that will not continue
[3:23:00.780 --> 3:23:05.340]  there's going to be a lot of wipeouts and and because that's really the big news we said this
[3:23:05.340 --> 3:23:10.380]  a month ago as we talked to the big food suppliers and others now it's in the news there's going to
[3:23:10.380 --> 3:23:16.380]  be shortages and the supply chain is breaking down that is insane well absolutely and and alex
[3:23:16.380 --> 3:23:20.620]  i'm sad to predict this but i'm predicting there are going to be food riots in america there will
[3:23:20.620 --> 3:23:26.860]  be shootings in in parking lot lots uh over food until and this is coming the national guard is
[3:23:26.860 --> 3:23:33.180]  going to lock down the walmart parking lot pickups the the costco's the targets by the way they
[3:23:33.180 --> 3:23:37.020]  announced as you know two weeks ago that's where they're deploying to yes the day it's happening
[3:23:37.020 --> 3:23:43.180]  here's new york and we just showed the dc earlier in maryland yes and and really the big picture here
[3:23:43.180 --> 3:23:49.020]  is this is my take on it this is absolutely real thousands of people are dying in italy
[3:23:49.020 --> 3:23:55.260]  europe is the new uhan and yet the globalists are piggybacking on this real event with real
[3:23:55.260 --> 3:24:00.300]  deaths in order to to bring in absolute tyranny and try to crush our civil rights and that's the
[3:24:00.300 --> 3:24:06.300]  battle alex from from here forward how do we maintain self-isolation for the period that's
[3:24:06.300 --> 3:24:11.020]  necessary to help trump beat this and help trump restore america's elections i wish i was out on
[3:24:11.020 --> 3:24:16.300]  a farm like you preposition the last five six years i've been so busy i mean i literally
[3:24:16.300 --> 3:24:19.900]  am sitting here in the middle of town of my family and i knew it was all coming but i've
[3:24:19.900 --> 3:24:24.780]  been so busy at the information guns that and now it's it's just catch up this is bad i mean
[3:24:24.780 --> 3:24:29.340]  there's i know they're making their move you're absolutely right brother i'm telling you this
[3:24:29.340 --> 3:24:34.620]  this is going to get bad and i know you at least i hope you've got some bug out locations in mind
[3:24:34.620 --> 3:24:39.980]  that that may be necessary may not you you have plenty of stored food i know but it may be it may
[3:24:39.980 --> 3:24:44.780]  come down to more than that the the thing is we now have to prepare to fight for our civil liberties
[3:24:44.780 --> 3:24:51.340]  as we endure the lockdown and isolation that is medically necessary or epidemiologically
[3:24:51.340 --> 3:24:54.620]  necessary that's what i've been saying and people try to say we're disagreeing i don't
[3:24:54.620 --> 3:24:58.940]  i've just been saying i'm worried about fighting the power grab you're right people do need to
[3:24:58.940 --> 3:25:03.740]  be isolated if they can the problem is they're trying to set the precedent to take all of
[3:25:03.740 --> 3:25:08.460]  our freedoms with this yes and here's my concern important advice for all your listeners if you've
[3:25:08.460 --> 3:25:14.460]  got stored food start thinking about microcaching right now start finding ways to literally
[3:25:14.460 --> 3:25:20.700]  hide your food because fema may go door to door and sees what they consider to be excess food
[3:25:20.700 --> 3:25:26.380]  so that's actually a federal law that clinton put in hoarding of food in an executive order
[3:25:26.380 --> 3:25:31.660]  that's right so people who plan in advance and by the way preppers they are the ones who are now
[3:25:31.660 --> 3:25:36.220]  no longer stressing the grocery stores because they prepped in advance so preppers should be
[3:25:36.220 --> 3:25:41.980]  thanked for easing this situation but preppers will be targeted and accused of hoarding in advance
[3:25:41.980 --> 3:25:47.020]  and fema can come door to door and take your food now this is why i'm growing potatoes alex
[3:25:47.020 --> 3:25:51.580]  important advice if you grow potatoes fema is not going to come in with shovels and dig the
[3:25:51.580 --> 3:25:56.300]  potatoes out of the ground so one way to hide food is to grow it and have it in the dirt and that
[3:25:56.300 --> 3:26:00.620]  may save your life sold the full spectrum of high quality seed banks forever we have them in stock
[3:26:00.620 --> 3:26:06.140]  that's right to ship out right now and the spring is here folks wherever you live it's easy to plant
[3:26:06.140 --> 3:26:10.780]  tomatoes it's easy to plant potatoes it's easy to plant these type of things and exactly the
[3:26:10.780 --> 3:26:15.260]  globalists are so lazy they won't be able to seize that and and and by the way your previous caller
[3:26:15.260 --> 3:26:22.940]  is absolutely correct alex my confession and my my error in all of this is i have vastly understated
[3:26:22.940 --> 3:26:28.060]  the the criticality the the the extent of this problem if you go back to my projection it's
[3:26:28.060 --> 3:26:32.300]  the guy that works all over the country he says there's less beds that's right see i overstated
[3:26:32.300 --> 3:26:37.340]  the number of hospital beds he's he's probably more correct than i am on that i understated the
[3:26:37.340 --> 3:26:41.900]  number of deaths that are about to occur my current model had only predicted by today there would be
[3:26:41.900 --> 3:26:47.900]  maybe 80 or 90 deaths in america now it's way over 200 my models were optimistic they were better
[3:26:47.900 --> 3:26:53.020]  than best case and that's what we know now so so if you follow the math on this this is going to get
[3:26:53.020 --> 3:26:58.380]  very bad for a while even though there have been a lot of lockdowns in in new york and california
[3:26:58.380 --> 3:27:04.300]  so i knew some literally licking his lips kwama they look like they just won the super bowl well
[3:27:04.300 --> 3:27:09.580]  this is see i think they knew this was coming we know the cdc knew about this last year and this
[3:27:09.580 --> 3:27:14.220]  is why newson was really aggressively taking away the second amendment rights of citizens
[3:27:14.220 --> 3:27:18.460]  and trying to strip everybody of their ability to defend themselves because tyranny is coming
[3:27:18.460 --> 3:27:23.500]  to california now this is what's going to happen alex state by state the people are going to have
[3:27:23.500 --> 3:27:29.020]  to decide how much liberty they will defend and fight for during all of this here in texas we
[3:27:29.020 --> 3:27:33.660]  aren't giving up our guns we're not going to sign up for vaccine mandates not a chance but will the
[3:27:33.660 --> 3:27:38.460]  people of california give up their guns or in the cities let's say will they give up their guns and
[3:27:38.460 --> 3:27:43.100]  do vaccine mandates maybe they will and the democrats are already talking about that in new
[3:27:43.100 --> 3:27:47.420]  orleans they say you can't have your guns that's right place they confiscated them before that's

[3:29:57.180 --> 3:30:03.020]  choreographed by the western media and every authoritarian regime on the planet that lust
[3:30:03.020 --> 3:30:09.820]  ever power and control their globalist system has been challenged humanity has awoken to them
[3:30:09.820 --> 3:30:16.140]  and so they use the man made of virus to create scenes out of a science fiction dystopia novel
[3:30:16.140 --> 3:30:23.180]  to scare the population into submission and then they launch their global corporate strike
[3:30:24.060 --> 3:30:31.820]  against the western world and against the average person and the average saver the average homeowner
[3:30:31.820 --> 3:30:37.340]  the average small business owner that's why the big mega corporations are exempt and they all get
[3:30:37.340 --> 3:30:43.820]  to stay open the mom and pops all have to close according to them it's a corporate strike against
[3:30:43.820 --> 3:30:50.060]  we the people it's a corporate strike the wuhan virus and the whole operation is a globalist
[3:30:50.060 --> 3:30:55.980]  corporate strike against the nation-state and individuals last sunday info wars exclusively
[3:30:55.980 --> 3:31:02.620]  reported from white house sources that trump was considering an interstate travel ban inside the
[3:31:02.620 --> 3:31:09.420]  united states a form of martial law that's never been implemented in our history some folks said
[3:31:09.420 --> 3:31:14.700]  when it didn't come true that we made it up what we said was he was considering it and days later
[3:31:14.700 --> 3:31:19.740]  it came out in mainstream news that indeed that was happening well now we're getting intel that
[3:31:19.740 --> 3:31:25.500]  trump's looking at declaring a national emergency this sunday and doing just that but is it sure
[3:31:25.500 --> 3:31:30.860]  if it's the right move and boom governor newson comes out says 40 million people can't leave
[3:31:30.860 --> 3:31:37.500]  their houses that's martial law and says he may officially declare martial law the globalist the
[3:31:37.500 --> 3:31:44.540]  leftist the chai cons the eu they're all setting the bar for massive martial law or trump hasn't
[3:31:44.540 --> 3:31:50.540]  done his job and they'll blame every death on trump this is an extremely dangerous time we're
[3:31:50.540 --> 3:31:55.980]  covering it live on the radio right now ladies and gentlemen alex jones here with a public
[3:31:55.980 --> 3:32:03.660]  service announcement info wars as of today is now suspending storable food sales we still have
[3:32:03.660 --> 3:32:07.500]  storeable food we're able to package all the storeable food and get it to everybody that
[3:32:07.500 --> 3:32:12.300]  ordered it most you've already gotten your food but the reason i'm making this announcement is
[3:32:12.300 --> 3:32:18.220]  all the other major food suppliers were sold out over a month ago as we first reported to you but
[3:32:18.220 --> 3:32:23.020]  they lied to you and they took your money well we know for the fact they're still taking everybody's
[3:32:23.020 --> 3:32:30.380]  money even though the food has all been sold out the basic ingredients for storeable food is gone
[3:32:30.380 --> 3:32:36.700]  all the big box stores are paying way over normal prices to buy up what's left and so anybody telling
[3:32:36.700 --> 3:32:42.540]  you that they have storeable food is lying to you the good news is everyone that ordered an
[3:32:42.540 --> 3:32:46.780]  info or store.com has already gotten it or if you ordered recently we have the food is being
[3:32:46.780 --> 3:32:52.940]  packaged and you will get it but as of now we are suspending all new food sales at info or store.com
[3:32:52.940 --> 3:32:59.100]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:32:59.100 --> 3:33:17.260]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones show
[3:33:29.100 --> 3:33:35.820]  some of them want to use you some of them want to get used by you
[3:33:36.860 --> 3:33:43.580]  ladies and gentlemen my head is spinning right now as i think about what is unfolding
[3:33:45.580 --> 3:33:49.580]  i just got a text from a very smart individual i will not name
[3:33:49.580 --> 3:33:58.940]  him who talks to the president on a routine basis and they said that if the shutdowns
[3:33:58.940 --> 3:34:04.220]  continue very long they believe there's going to be a big depression but at the same time the
[3:34:04.220 --> 3:34:11.500]  virus has to be taken seriously so that's the hobson's choice or the paradox and i want my
[3:34:11.500 --> 3:34:18.460]  gathams repeat what he just told you i told you over a month ago i said you better get your food
[3:34:18.460 --> 3:34:24.460]  orders in it's going to go from seven to fourteen days to three to four weeks it did then i said
[3:34:24.460 --> 3:34:28.060]  it's gonna go six to eight weeks and if it goes past eight weeks they're talking about suspending
[3:34:28.060 --> 3:34:31.740]  food sales because they're not going to sit there on top of your money that long well now
[3:34:31.740 --> 3:34:36.700]  i got a call on monday and they just said we're out of the food we haven't up to fulfill all this
[3:34:37.420 --> 3:34:40.700]  but everything's selling out the supply chain's broken down and then i talked to a bunch of other
[3:34:40.700 --> 3:34:45.420]  people that are involved in it well we knew that four weeks ago the other food companies couldn't
[3:34:45.420 --> 3:34:51.260]  even get it we had the biggest of the best it's over you heard mike he's involved in industries
[3:34:51.260 --> 3:34:55.980]  and other things as well now it's in the news shortages they can't supply it but here's what's
[3:34:55.980 --> 3:35:03.100]  worse a lot of people got so scared even in critical infrastructure warehouses farming
[3:35:03.100 --> 3:35:08.540]  distribution they ran for the hills and it's mainly executives and managers that had plenty
[3:35:08.540 --> 3:35:15.420]  of money they think they've all headed for the hills and so things are already breaking down so
[3:35:15.420 --> 3:35:21.420]  that's the psych warfare that's why they released it they incubated it in china they launched it
[3:35:21.420 --> 3:35:25.980]  it's all clear and now the media says wall street journal new york times don't call it
[3:35:26.540 --> 3:35:31.420]  the chinese virus don't call it the wuhan virus trump has given notes and that says that you
[3:35:31.420 --> 3:35:39.420]  you're covered 19 so you can see the motive you can see it all but i'm not saying the virus is a
[3:35:39.420 --> 3:35:45.180]  hoax i'm saying the media hysteria over it is the hoax and china says they've peaked and they're
[3:35:45.180 --> 3:35:50.220]  okay now and europe's the epicenter okay well how many died in china not that many supposedly
[3:35:50.220 --> 3:35:55.100]  unless they're lying well then why do we have to stay closed 18 months that's what the psychotic
[3:35:55.100 --> 3:36:00.060]  left wants there'll be no small businesses left notice only the big corporations mike are able
[3:36:00.060 --> 3:36:05.420]  to stay open during this i mean this is a total plan to lock everything down selectively in my
[3:36:05.420 --> 3:36:11.340]  view what's your view we're also collapsing into socialism finance and mass inflation i'll talk
[3:36:11.340 --> 3:36:15.020]  about that in a second but remember china is not under control they're having reinfections
[3:36:15.020 --> 3:36:21.100]  hong kong just had a mini explosion of plus 48 new cases overnight hong kong doesn't have it under
[3:36:21.100 --> 3:36:25.660]  control even though the asian countries like taiwan and singapore have done the best job
[3:36:25.660 --> 3:36:32.140]  in south korea they did it through very aggressive testing surveillance uh by that what that means
[3:36:32.140 --> 3:36:38.860]  is testing the public and having uh intel on the the infections that doesn't mean stalking people
[3:36:39.580 --> 3:36:43.740]  but the other thing is they did contact tracing and they did an isolation so that's why their
[3:36:43.740 --> 3:36:48.860]  growth curves are linear instead of exponential they will keep it under control in those countries
[3:36:48.860 --> 3:36:53.020]  the the united states is not yet doing any of those things aggressively enough and europe did
[3:36:53.020 --> 3:36:57.900]  not and italy waited and spain had a lot of censorship alex spain was covering this up and
[3:36:57.900 --> 3:37:02.060]  saying everything's fine because we have all these spanish festivals coming up we need the tourists
[3:37:02.060 --> 3:37:07.580]  so spain is is about to have a very big problem in the hospitals in the uk are collapsing uh i got
[3:37:07.580 --> 3:37:12.860]  to say at this point i think the debate is over that whether this is deadly or not thousands of
[3:37:12.860 --> 3:37:17.180]  bodies truck loads of bodies in italy that that debate is over the only question is how bad does
[3:37:17.180 --> 3:37:22.220]  it get or how quickly can we get it under control uh the new york city hospitals are about to get
[3:37:22.220 --> 3:37:29.340]  flooded and it's going to happen in san francisco as well but much of america geographically texas
[3:37:29.340 --> 3:37:34.540]  and the and the midwest and so on could get through this relatively unscathed if people would stay
[3:37:34.540 --> 3:37:38.860]  home and actually do what trump is suggesting right now so the best way we can support trump in my
[3:37:38.860 --> 3:37:44.380]  opinion alex is to stay home don't spread the virus let us get through this so we can have a
[3:37:44.380 --> 3:37:49.900]  recovery on the other side trump can can help us solve this and we can have elections and trump
[3:37:49.900 --> 3:37:54.540]  wins reelection and then he can continue to fight the deep state if but if people don't stay home
[3:37:54.540 --> 3:37:58.540]  if people go out and spread the infection it's going to get worse and worse and trump's going
[3:37:58.540 --> 3:38:03.020]  to take the blame because of the narrative that the media has set up for this but uh financial
[3:38:03.020 --> 3:38:08.060]  socialism is now a very big problem because we're talking about helicopter money to give free money
[3:38:08.060 --> 3:38:13.660]  to everybody much more currency fiat currency chasing a very limited supply of scarce goods
[3:38:13.660 --> 3:38:19.020]  you're going to see price inflation on a huge level including these massive corporate bailouts that
[3:38:19.020 --> 3:38:23.340]  they've got flood money in all these all these corporations and banks money that's essentially
[3:38:23.340 --> 3:38:28.940]  being stolen from us the taxpayers sure you've got globalists running around saying oh it's going
[3:38:28.940 --> 3:38:35.180]  to be a great depression but but but what about what about the denominator and i'm not a big math
[3:38:35.180 --> 3:38:40.060]  guy but we don't know the real death threat is we don't know how many people really have it we just
[3:38:40.060 --> 3:38:45.260]  go off these u n numbers and obviously it kills some people mainly old people i'm i'm not denying
[3:38:45.260 --> 3:38:51.100]  that mike what i'm saying is if we have a total depression that's going to kill way more people
[3:38:51.100 --> 3:38:54.780]  other than this virus is and i'm not saying people shouldn't try to protect themselves but
[3:38:54.780 --> 3:38:59.180]  i mean at a certain point we shut down for 18 months or maybe we just end civilization we
[3:38:59.180 --> 3:39:03.500]  all commit suicide i mean well the the alternative is just let it burn through the population and
[3:39:03.500 --> 3:39:10.140]  aim for so-called herd immunity which requires really about 83 percent of the population to
[3:39:10.140 --> 3:39:16.220]  either be immune or dead so if you go that route you get a very compressed peak of hospitalizations
[3:39:16.220 --> 3:39:21.420]  and death rates skyrocket to 10 percent or 15 what about nuisance numbers because he's talking
[3:39:21.420 --> 3:39:26.460]  about you know saying half the public will have it or more locking everything down yes you know
[3:39:26.460 --> 3:39:31.180]  they're talking about 20 percent get hospitalized where does nuisance i don't believe a damn thing
[3:39:31.180 --> 3:39:35.980]  comes out of that demon's mouth well nuisance nuisance numbers are a projection of what happens
[3:39:35.980 --> 3:39:41.420]  if they don't do the lockdown so actually we we kind of reverse engineered his announcement
[3:39:41.420 --> 3:39:46.540]  and we believe that nuisance believes there are 100 000 californians infected right now
[3:39:46.540 --> 3:39:52.460]  100 000 and you know that that doubles really about every four days but you could say a week
[3:39:52.460 --> 3:39:57.100]  if you want to be more conservative that's why he said in what he said in eight weeks the majority
[3:39:57.100 --> 3:40:03.100]  will be infected 25.5 million is what he said in eight weeks which would be 510 000 deaths
[3:40:03.100 --> 3:40:09.500]  in about 13 weeks in california but that scenario will not occur so because because of the stay at
[3:40:09.500 --> 3:40:14.780]  home situation the social distancing as it's called there will not be 25 million californians
[3:40:14.780 --> 3:40:19.100]  my my here's the paradox and i'm not debating you the virus kills people and it's obviously a
[3:40:19.100 --> 3:40:24.700]  bio weapon and it's a weapon against america and we see all that we don't know the real morbidity
[3:40:24.700 --> 3:40:29.100]  rate because we don't know how many people really have it because there's not the testing
[3:40:29.100 --> 3:40:33.660]  so i'm saying how do you do an equation when you don't have all the pieces well you're right that
[3:40:33.660 --> 3:40:37.580]  we don't have enough testing to know for sure but we also don't know the numerator of that
[3:40:37.580 --> 3:40:42.140]  fraction which is the people who are dying right now are also in many cases not being tested
[3:40:42.140 --> 3:40:47.340]  and their cause of death is not being listed as the coronavirus so what we do see is truckloads
[3:40:47.340 --> 3:40:53.020]  of dead bodies in italy hospitals overrun in italy nurses and doctors crying screaming for help
[3:40:53.020 --> 3:40:58.140]  the uk now has run out of hospital beds and now we see us military arriving at sports stadiums
[3:40:58.140 --> 3:41:02.860]  that's right that's right there will be mass overflows of dead bodies in america
[3:41:02.860 --> 3:41:08.380]  mark my words that's coming in less than 30 days in certain cities but again most of america
[3:41:08.380 --> 3:41:13.980]  geographically can get through this if we we follow what trump is is asking us to do which is
[3:41:13.980 --> 3:41:21.660]  how do we know how do we deal though with the economy imploding uh this is a global reset
[3:41:21.660 --> 3:41:27.660]  that we're looking at alex i'm afraid it's a it's a this is the black swan meets another black swan
[3:41:27.660 --> 3:41:33.660]  they have baby black swans i mean this is a black swan but i agree this is a mommy and daddy
[3:41:35.020 --> 3:41:41.260]  swans and they've had a whole bunch of little baby black swans it's i don't i'm not sure that the
[3:41:41.260 --> 3:41:46.540]  western financial infrastructure survives this i have to say honestly i i'm not sure you know
[3:41:46.540 --> 3:41:51.660]  you for years talked about the importance of gold and silver and land and hard assets that can't
[3:41:51.660 --> 3:41:57.420]  vanish and boy that that advice is really great advice because a lot of other assets are already
[3:41:57.420 --> 3:42:01.900]  in the process of vanishing and i know a lot of people that are moving into treasuries t-bills
[3:42:01.900 --> 3:42:07.580]  uh treasury direct dot gov i think you can buy treasuries but eventually the dollar probably
[3:42:07.580 --> 3:42:12.140]  is going to be hurt very bad you'll lose purchasing power pretty aggressively as this bailout continues
[3:42:12.140 --> 3:42:15.660]  well listen if i had the time and energy i should have been smart and then follow my own advice when
[3:42:15.660 --> 3:42:20.460]  we've got a family ranch in these texas but that's three hours away uh i do need to i mean i was
[3:42:20.460 --> 3:42:25.100]  already looking the last few months before this at pieces of property and just had all in put all
[3:42:25.100 --> 3:42:30.860]  my money back into the info or to beat the globalist but i mean i at a certain point though i mean
[3:42:30.860 --> 3:42:34.620]  they're talking about lockdowns this is an essential operation we have a warehouse it has
[3:42:34.620 --> 3:42:39.100]  food or supplements media you can say is essential but they can selectively enforce that there
[3:42:39.100 --> 3:42:42.220]  probably could come a day if this gets really bad where they're going to try to shut us down and
[3:42:42.220 --> 3:42:46.060]  we'll be off the air i won't be happy about that and i'll fight it tooth and nail and we've got ways
[3:42:46.060 --> 3:42:49.980]  to stay on air and want to let the globalists know that but still half of me just wants to bug
[3:42:49.980 --> 3:42:58.780]  out of here we'll be right back our constitutions our health is our most valuable asset it's what

[3:47:46.060 --> 3:47:52.620]  work now um mike Adams of natural news i've got this question for you
[3:47:53.500 --> 3:47:58.220]  trump was behind the curve and i totally agreed with you and others that he needed to get ahead
[3:47:58.220 --> 3:48:03.900]  of it or they were going to blame him and they clearly then did that now they're trying to get
[3:48:03.900 --> 3:48:07.740]  into clampdown more and longer because they know it'll hurt the economy which they'll then blame
[3:48:07.740 --> 3:48:12.780]  on him he obviously knows that but how do you think trumps done so far and what do you think
[3:48:12.780 --> 3:48:17.580]  they're going to hit him with next actually i think after he got over that initial curve
[3:48:17.580 --> 3:48:21.820]  he's done really extraordinarily well and he's he's found that middle ground he said he's not
[3:48:21.820 --> 3:48:25.820]  going to have a national lockdown trump is leaving it up to the states and regions to
[3:48:25.820 --> 3:48:31.740]  decide for themselves i think trump is is really now doing a very good job on this although i wish
[3:48:31.740 --> 3:48:36.300]  he would recommend vitamin c i wish he would tell people to start growing food in their own front
[3:48:36.300 --> 3:48:41.260]  yards he should issue an executive order that legalizes home gardening in every neighborhood
[3:48:41.260 --> 3:48:46.540]  in every yard across america victory gardens for america to help the stress food supply
[3:48:46.540 --> 3:48:50.540]  so that people can grow their own food so that that's what i think and also by the way he's a
[3:48:50.540 --> 3:48:56.220]  little too uh much friendly with big pharma and the vaccine industry and hasn't mentioned the
[3:48:56.220 --> 3:49:01.340]  antivirals and the supplements and the superfoods yet but on the big pharma question here alex this
[3:49:01.340 --> 3:49:09.260]  is how we can avoid a vaccine mandate coming down on all of us there is this drug it's a hydroxychloroquine
[3:49:09.260 --> 3:49:14.620]  or chloroquine however you pronounce it uh it's it it's working in many patients in early trials
[3:49:14.620 --> 3:49:20.140]  it's working very well it's a low-cost generic drug it does not enrich big pharma it can be
[3:49:20.140 --> 3:49:26.300]  manufactured by anybody it's off patent this should be made available right now all across america
[3:49:26.300 --> 3:49:31.100]  and i think novartis actually just donated millions of doses of this which is which is good
[3:49:31.100 --> 3:49:38.140]  i know your research tell folks what this old known very effective uh anti malaria drug does
[3:49:38.140 --> 3:49:44.300]  it it somehow pushes zinc into the cells yes it pushes zinc into the cells interfering with the
[3:49:44.300 --> 3:49:50.220]  mitochondrial replication of the virus so what this means everybody listen get some zinc because
[3:49:50.220 --> 3:49:55.180]  if you don't have zinc in your blood this drug can't work effectively it doesn't mean that zinc
[3:49:55.180 --> 3:49:59.660]  itself stops the virus from replicating but in combination with this drug and they also use an
[3:49:59.660 --> 3:50:05.340]  antibacterial by the way that's that's off label you know very common in combination it stops most
[3:50:05.340 --> 3:50:10.140]  viral replication now there are some side effects there is some kidney damage in people who have
[3:50:10.140 --> 3:50:15.340]  vulnerability to that it's it's not without risk but the risks are very low exactly nothing on this
[3:50:15.340 --> 3:50:21.260]  world is a panacea nothing is perfect but you notice there's nothing in the media about zinc but
[3:50:21.260 --> 3:50:26.860]  people know did you know zinc sold out almost everywhere yes it's sold out everywhere absolutely
[3:50:26.860 --> 3:50:30.300]  just like potatoes are starting to get sold out everywhere because people are realizing it's time
[3:50:30.300 --> 3:50:36.220]  to grow potatoes and things like that but look we can beat this we've got that drug we've got the
[3:50:36.220 --> 3:50:42.540]  zinc we've got antiviral herbs we've got vitamin c you know if it we can beat this we can get
[3:50:42.540 --> 3:50:47.260]  through this it's going to be hell for a couple of months when i saw articles going people take
[3:50:47.260 --> 3:50:52.460]  take uh you know time to have comfort food ice cream cake and liquor that's the answer to what
[3:50:52.460 --> 3:50:58.780]  you name that's that's right and also alex america's health overall is very poor we have very high
[3:50:58.780 --> 3:51:03.260]  comorbidity factors as they're called a lot of people are on a lot of prescription drugs a lot
[3:51:03.260 --> 3:51:07.900]  of people have a sedentary lifestyle they're very similar to the chinese we're very unhealthy
[3:51:07.900 --> 3:51:13.020]  well and and even i would say that italians are healthier than americans yeah of course they are
[3:51:13.020 --> 3:51:17.740]  and and so americans i would not be surprised if we have a five percent or a six percent fatality
[3:51:17.740 --> 3:51:23.020]  rate in the united states from this perhaps we it's too early to tell we'll see maybe it's only two
[3:51:23.020 --> 3:51:29.180]  percent okay but it's not going to be anywhere near zero or the one tenth of one percent which is
[3:51:29.180 --> 3:51:34.380]  which is the common flu this is going to kill a lot of people but we could get through this with
[3:51:34.380 --> 3:51:40.220]  even i'm even admitting this pharmaceutical can help zinc can help the herbs and foods can help
[3:51:40.220 --> 3:51:44.780]  but most of all folks you know get off the junk foods get off the sodas stop smoking cigarettes
[3:51:44.780 --> 3:51:48.460]  stop your unhealthy lifestyles because that's going to get you killed well let me raise this
[3:51:48.460 --> 3:51:53.260]  mike we both together with our expert guest predicted all this happening the hysteria
[3:51:53.260 --> 3:51:56.860]  said it was serious people go alex you're saying it's really serious then you're saying don't over
[3:51:56.860 --> 3:52:01.980]  blow it the the effects the hysteria the lockdown the depression we knew it was all coming the
[3:52:01.980 --> 3:52:07.740]  breakdown the food supply this this all of that and and if it's one percent dies now people are
[3:52:07.740 --> 3:52:13.180]  going to go crazy and we're off the edge of that's right what about this article a fiasco in the making
[3:52:13.180 --> 3:52:16.860]  as the coronavirus pandemic takes hold we are making decisions without reliable data that's
[3:52:16.860 --> 3:52:22.060]  from stat news and they're just going to say we don't have the basic numbers no one really knows
[3:52:22.060 --> 3:52:26.220]  so then i go back to anecdotal the army vehicles the thousands of dead in italy
[3:52:27.260 --> 3:52:31.020]  the things we do see says that there is something going on with this and then the fact that it's
[3:52:31.020 --> 3:52:35.500]  man-made that's where i really get concerned and why doesn't trump make a bigger deal about that
[3:52:35.500 --> 3:52:39.340]  he did point out that it came out of china they shouldn't blame the u.s military why doesn't he
[3:52:39.340 --> 3:52:44.460]  just come out and say it well at least he is calling it a chinese virus which is accurate it is the
[3:52:44.460 --> 3:52:50.460]  uhan virus or the ccc virus as the epoch times refers to it but look we because of the speed at
[3:52:50.460 --> 3:52:54.940]  which this moves we can't wait for perfect data this is part of the issue we have to stay ahead
[3:52:54.940 --> 3:53:00.540]  of this curve of rapid exponential spread so it means we have to make some decisions without full
[3:53:00.540 --> 3:53:05.420]  information at our disposal and that's you know the speed of this is the issue if we don't move
[3:53:05.420 --> 3:53:10.540]  quickly enough we end up like italy or spain or the uk now being overrun or even new york city
[3:53:10.540 --> 3:53:15.660]  they move slowly in fact america moves slowly because the cdc did it on purpose as as you
[3:53:15.660 --> 3:53:20.700]  well know we talked about this the cdc withheld testing kits to put us behind almost a month
[3:53:20.700 --> 3:53:27.980]  so the cdc created this situation and i hope when this is over and done with because we will survive
[3:53:27.980 --> 3:53:33.820]  that trump investigates the criminal offenses of the cdc the criminal negligence of that agency
[3:53:33.820 --> 3:53:38.540]  that will cost maybe hundreds of thousands of lives in america because they couldn't stop
[3:53:38.540 --> 3:53:42.940]  diseases and that's their only damn job alex and they have all these bio weapon labs and sell
[3:53:42.940 --> 3:53:46.940]  this crap to everybody all right mike adams natural news dot com thank you for all the time

[3:54:04.860 --> 3:54:11.660]  um i'm gonna be up here seven days a week my wife and children understand this is such an insane
[3:54:11.660 --> 3:54:15.820]  time the best news i've seen a while though is that it is from cnn so i got to check what they
[3:54:15.820 --> 3:54:21.020]  said but guys bring in that article please the president says he's not gonna have a total lock
[3:54:21.020 --> 3:54:26.940]  now and he's gonna leave it the states well that's really good news because that would kill the economy
[3:54:26.940 --> 3:54:30.460]  and have a great depression as the federalist society or my closest friend of the president
[3:54:30.460 --> 3:54:36.460]  but that's not currently considering nationwide lockdown i just saw another one where he was
[3:54:36.460 --> 3:54:42.540]  saying he's not going to do it to leave to the states my problem is they keep ratcheting it up
[3:54:42.540 --> 3:54:49.020]  and these governors are the ones that are doing this and it's out of control and so there's a
[3:54:49.020 --> 3:54:53.820]  question where he was asked this so i will grab the video we'll have on the war room this is a big
[3:54:53.820 --> 3:54:59.340]  deal um even if it kills a million people folks which i don't think it will a great depression
[3:54:59.340 --> 3:55:03.100]  is worse than that and you just can't live in a cave because there's things out there that are
[3:55:03.100 --> 3:55:09.660]  a problem and i love old folks but it's 90 plus percent are above the age of 70 this is not killed
[3:55:09.660 --> 3:55:15.820]  anybody below the age of 30 yet and it's just it's just out of control it gives government total
[3:55:15.820 --> 3:55:19.100]  power now governments are trying to control the bandwidth and who can have internet and it's just
[3:55:19.100 --> 3:55:23.580]  going to get worse and worse the level of tyranny you will live under is the exact level that you
[3:55:23.580 --> 3:55:29.660]  will put up with is thomas jefferson said i don't think we'll ever find that necessary there is the
