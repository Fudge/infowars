[00:00.000 --> 00:11.880]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:11.880 --> 00:20.640]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.640 --> 00:30.400]  my father tried to call me a bunch yesterday while I was on air and only
[00:30.400 --> 00:33.760]  talked to him for about 30 seconds because I answered the phone right before
[00:33.760 --> 00:37.360]  I went back live and he's like hey there's an Occupy the Fed event at this
[00:37.360 --> 00:40.600]  road and that road today and I thought he was talking about Austin he was
[00:40.600 --> 00:44.600]  talking about Dallas and then he called me a couple times last night and I missed
[00:44.600 --> 00:47.400]  his call and he called me a couple times this morning what man again he calls me
[00:47.400 --> 00:52.040]  maybe once a week or every two weeks he's call after call so I call him back
[00:52.040 --> 00:57.680]  and I go what's going on and he goes well you didn't cover it you didn't talk
[00:57.680 --> 01:02.160]  about it and I said I didn't talk about what and I had the article yesterday and
[01:02.160 --> 01:08.040]  I did read it and I was aware of it and I am so blind now because I'm so close to
[01:08.040 --> 01:11.720]  this thing like when you're one inch away from the elephant you know it's a
[01:11.720 --> 01:17.000]  gray skin it's got black hair it smells a little bit but you can't really tell
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.280]  what it is you got to back off 10 finger that's an elephant I'm so close to it
[01:21.280 --> 01:25.680]  that when I read things now the admissions of world government and
[01:25.680 --> 01:32.320]  secret private cities vying for global control and Lord Blackheath comes out
[01:32.320 --> 01:38.960]  admits world government in the House of Lords I see this stuff now every day at
[01:38.960 --> 01:44.840]  least every week and I don't cover it because I already know it's true I've
[01:44.840 --> 01:50.160]  known it's true for 18 years I've been on air 16 plus I've been awake for 18
[01:50.160 --> 01:56.000]  years to a great extent learning always more but to the basics 18 years and I
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.920]  am I have got a big blind spot so please folks you send me emails and say why
[02:01.920 --> 02:05.800]  aren't you covering this or that it's because I already know this stuff just
[02:05.800 --> 02:08.600]  like you already know this stuff and so I just start thinking everybody knows it
[02:08.600 --> 02:11.840]  it's like oh here's another big article globalist fighting with each other over
[02:11.840 --> 02:18.520]  what city-state will rule will it be Israel will it be the Vatican will it be
[02:18.520 --> 02:23.800]  the city of London will it be DC they're getting down to the final phase
[02:23.800 --> 02:29.120]  they're in fighting with each other have the Russians playing out of the Chinese
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.840]  playing to all this and they're all run by their own mafias that always create
[02:34.840 --> 02:42.120]  their own little city-states like Moscow and the Politburo the Duma and here's
[02:42.120 --> 02:45.440]  John Major and it's buried a Daily Mail article it's a bunch of other articles
[02:45.440 --> 02:48.320]  too fact this is the one I couldn't even find the one I had yesterday and read
[02:48.320 --> 02:51.840]  where it got in even more of them to look forward during a break but golden
[02:51.840 --> 02:56.000]  chance to win back power from EU and they talk about the Maastricht Treaty and
[02:56.000 --> 03:04.000]  how it set up the city of London to be its own entity exempt from EU rules
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.160]  and how under this new private super state getting rid of all sovereignty in
[03:09.160 --> 03:15.480]  Europe that if England stays signed on to this they will lose all their power
[03:15.480 --> 03:19.920]  and the city of London itself will be absorbed into the city of Frankfurt and
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.600]  of course the Treaty of Rome setting up the Euro that does have people always
[03:23.600 --> 03:28.520]  want me to talk about the Vatican this Vatican that I try to not get into this
[03:28.520 --> 03:31.720]  religious group that religious group try to stay out of all that but the point
[03:31.720 --> 03:36.880]  is the institution of the Vatican the money power of it that is so wealthy
[03:36.880 --> 03:42.400]  it's untold was involved the Vatican Braggs at the heart of setting up the
[03:42.400 --> 03:47.160]  Euro watch the Treaty of Rome signed there in Rome there at the Vatican
[03:47.160 --> 03:53.440]  1957 to set up the Euro so here's John Major and again my dad called me right
[03:53.440 --> 03:56.600]  before I went on air again because I've been playing phone tag this morning and
[03:56.600 --> 04:01.160]  this I said hey print me an article about John Major wanting power back from
[04:01.160 --> 04:05.240]  the EU and I got the Daily Mail this is not the one I read yesterday it was

[04:28.160 --> 04:33.200]  UK Independence Party and others have pointed out over 70% of UK laws are

[08:35.760 --> 08:41.560]  some amazing video of the Occupy Wall Street calling for collectivism calling
[08:41.560 --> 08:47.000]  for people that don't agree with them to be arrested in DC with the Occupy Wall
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.600]  Street DC people that of course was the top main link on Drudge a week and a
[08:51.600 --> 08:56.400]  half ago the big jumbo Tyrannosaurus Godzilla number one link on the internet
[08:56.400 --> 09:01.360]  to get that link a big story and I got criticized for posting his video having
[09:01.360 --> 09:04.680]  Paul Watson write an article about it by the Occupy Wall Street people they
[09:04.680 --> 09:09.160]  said that is not indicative of us we are open and inclusive we are not
[09:09.160 --> 09:13.800]  authoritarians we don't agree with Michael Moore who says capitalism's the
[09:13.800 --> 09:17.920]  problem you're just trying to make this look like it's Democratic operatives
[09:17.920 --> 09:22.120]  well Adam Kokesh is in a Democrat or Republican and he's well known for that
[09:22.120 --> 09:28.600]  same with yours truly we just cover what we see and then I sent reporters
[09:28.600 --> 09:33.120]  different parts of the country and I did find that the grassroots were upset
[09:33.120 --> 09:36.880]  about the bailouts upset about the private fellow deserve upset about not
[09:36.880 --> 09:41.840]  being able to get jobs the economy where we're going but that there were
[09:41.840 --> 09:46.400]  Democratic Party operatives move on or George Soros people there and that the
[09:46.400 --> 09:49.920]  unions were trying to take it over SEI you and others that routinely you know
[09:49.920 --> 09:55.160]  go out and beat up tea party people and so all that's going on but I'm saying
[09:55.160 --> 09:59.160]  yeah it's diverse it's diverse and then in Dallas that are in the Fed event
[09:59.160 --> 10:02.880]  Friday about a hundred of the Occupy Wall Street across the street from our
[10:02.880 --> 10:08.840]  400 I was told we're bullhorning us kind of saying some mean things so I went
[10:08.840 --> 10:12.560]  over and bullhorn back and then noticed that about half the signs were in the
[10:12.560 --> 10:15.720]  fed so it was a bunch of our people over there with them trying to educate them
[10:15.720 --> 10:20.120]  and then then they came over and were somewhat friendly the same thing
[10:20.120 --> 10:25.560]  happened a little bit in Houston but then I said look I'm your friend and so
[10:25.560 --> 10:28.880]  they came over and joined us and I said go down to there and can't but at the
[10:28.880 --> 10:33.960]  park down the street and it was all a great deal now I get to San Antonio I
[10:33.960 --> 10:38.760]  get to San Antonio I'm gonna go to the story more in a moment I'm always
[10:38.760 --> 10:41.440]  trying to mention who's coming up today than I heard just getting into the news
[10:41.440 --> 10:48.240]  right away and Matt Medina the head of we are changed on their great activists
[10:48.240 --> 10:52.040]  friends with him for years and others some of the we are changed folks had
[10:52.040 --> 10:58.760]  called me earlier in the week so had so had Medina and they said well no most
[10:58.760 --> 11:02.040]  these people are taking Ron Paul and in full war stickers and are aware of the
[11:02.040 --> 11:05.680]  Fed and want to march with us to the Fed and they're good there are some move on
[11:05.680 --> 11:09.000]  people trying to stir stuff up but they're not running things so overall
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.200]  this is not you've been taken over well he showed up Sunday and he and the
[11:13.200 --> 11:18.080]  videos up at prisonplanet.tv and we also posted this morning an info wars.com
[11:18.080 --> 11:22.840]  and he said they came in and they said you don't talk to Medina no Ron Paul
[11:22.840 --> 11:27.080]  stickers we're not against the Fed just like Michael Moore said oh no the Fed
[11:27.080 --> 11:31.400]  it's it's good it's the problem is capitalism anybody having property
[11:31.400 --> 11:38.000]  except of course for people worth hundreds of millions like Michael Moore and
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.040]  then now there's a new video out from Kokesh and we've got him coming on as I
[11:43.040 --> 11:49.440]  said you're in about 50 minutes from now a new video and our headline on it is
[11:49.440 --> 11:55.000]  occupy agitators attempt to ban first amendment
[11:58.120 --> 12:02.480]  and I would actually what that's a good headline Watson give it I would just say
[12:02.480 --> 12:14.320]  occupy organizers because they play this this mind game of we're not we're not
[12:14.320 --> 12:25.600]  in charge but we are in charge so all of that is happening and going on and now
[12:25.600 --> 12:31.520]  there is video of the occupy agitators attempt to ban the first amendment in
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.040]  this supposed public meeting that everybody's invited to for this grand
[12:36.040 --> 12:40.400]  collective where they steer it the way they want but they're telling them you're
[12:40.400 --> 12:46.520]  not allowed to videotape in here though other people can videotape and it gets
[12:46.520 --> 12:51.680]  worse Darren McBrain our reporter and I've met a son his sons though what a
[12:51.680 --> 13:00.880]  senior in high school he went down to the occupy Wall Street event yesterday
[13:00.880 --> 13:07.280]  here in Austin and he had a Ron Paul sign and they came over to him and said
[13:07.280 --> 13:12.200]  that's not welcome here get it out of here but they could have their SCIU Union
[13:12.200 --> 13:15.320]  signs they could have their tax the rich signs they could have their
[13:15.320 --> 13:19.480]  Democratic talking points in Manhattan they're marching to Republican
[13:19.480 --> 13:26.320]  billionaires houses the Koch brothers and other people like Rupert Murdoch I
[13:26.320 --> 13:30.560]  mean you could see this is now a Democrat agenda you don't bring your
[13:30.560 --> 13:34.840]  Ron Paul here you don't march on the Fed you don't have in the Fed science here
[13:34.840 --> 13:40.000]  you understand no don't come to our group and try to get them to come out to
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.600]  your March Sunday or to come out to protest the Fed we like the fellow
[13:43.600 --> 13:48.200]  reserve and they have these little whisper campaigns and they're leading it
[13:48.200 --> 13:52.600]  they send in professional agitators and they say we're all here we're not going
[13:52.600 --> 13:57.440]  to be co-opted move on dot org loves you Obama loves you and they play this
[13:57.440 --> 14:03.600]  mind game so the only information now allowed in Occupy Wall Street is if you
[14:03.600 --> 14:07.640]  want to have a yoga event and not chant that's what happened in Austin I'm not
[14:07.640 --> 14:10.960]  knocking folks that do yoga certainly good for you and my point is is that's
[14:10.960 --> 14:14.760]  what they did and they come up and they say don't have Ron Paul here and I'm
[14:14.760 --> 14:19.160]  getting these reports all over the country from Denver you name it that you
[14:19.160 --> 14:26.000]  don't bring Ron Paul here do you understand us we're for freedom you
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.360]  want to call for communism you want to call for collectivism you want to call
[14:29.360 --> 14:33.400]  for taxing the rich you want to call for some blanket Wall Street's evil that's
[14:33.400 --> 14:37.120]  wonderful you don't actually talk about the global kingpins that are caught
[14:37.120 --> 14:40.040]  laundering the money and that they've gotten tens of trillions of bailout
[14:40.040 --> 14:44.560]  money that want to implode our society the private fellow reserve and I've had
[14:44.560 --> 14:47.920]  calls from all over the country and I've had a reporters where they'll the
[14:47.920 --> 14:52.000]  Occupy Wall Street people that quote are leading things but aren't will say at
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.120]  every event no even there sometimes marks by the Fed they were like we're not
[14:56.120 --> 14:59.480]  going to stop there we'll be arrested that's federal property they're not our
[14:59.480 --> 15:03.640]  problem Wall Street is and so they tell him just like Michael Moore it's federal
[15:03.640 --> 15:09.400]  it's our friend I mean what do you expect George Soros led movements to do
[15:09.400 --> 15:16.680]  MSNBC general electric bomb makers they love Obama they love the wars the
[15:16.680 --> 15:21.840]  torture the secret arrest the endless tyranny they're very pleased they've
[15:21.840 --> 15:26.280]  got their professional psych warfare people in there and it looks like they're
[15:26.280 --> 15:29.800]  starting to win they're starting to fully try to take it over and they'll
[15:29.800 --> 15:35.360]  just march right up to you whether it's North Carolina or Texas whether it's
[15:35.360 --> 15:39.360]  Colorado New York or DC and they tell you you get your stinking Ron Paul signs
[15:39.360 --> 15:49.080]  out of here and the SSEI you folks well known are just going and Warren Buffett
[15:49.080 --> 15:52.680]  George Soros Rockefeller they've got Herman Cain on the right calling for
[15:52.680 --> 15:58.000]  sending they are a VAT or sales tax on top of a succulent carbon tax and they
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.840]  got Mitt Romney calling for a carbon tax and they got Rick Perry in the past
[16:01.840 --> 16:06.360]  pushing it and Levin Al Gore and and and it doesn't matter because people love to
[16:06.360 --> 16:10.480]  be conned and Rick Perry gets up there with a big giant red ax on TV and talks
[16:10.480 --> 16:13.320]  about he's going to axe things when he doubled the size of Texas government and

[24:32.320 --> 24:36.960]  in crash against the shore and then go back the other direction and hopefully
[24:36.960 --> 24:41.240]  we won't listen to the neocons who say don't go to those meetings they're all
[24:41.240 --> 24:46.400]  hippies which you know they're all communist which then makes it a self
[24:46.400 --> 24:51.720]  fulfilling prophecy for conservatives and libertarians and constitutionalist
[24:51.720 --> 24:56.600]  then don't go to the Occupy Wall Street don't get in the field don't get media
[24:56.600 --> 25:01.040]  attention don't bring up in the Fed don't bring up the banker bailouts don't
[25:01.040 --> 25:08.640]  bring up the monopoly collectivist crony globalist just like they came out and
[25:08.640 --> 25:12.440]  said the Tea Party's all right wingers and by the way they're only white and by
[25:12.440 --> 25:16.880]  the way they don't like you if you are another color that was meant to then make
[25:16.880 --> 25:21.320]  people go well I I want lower taxes and less regulations I want freedom but
[25:21.320 --> 25:25.880]  since I've got some pigment in my skin I better not go to that meeting I better
[25:25.880 --> 25:31.320]  not go see it's a self-fulfilling prophecy and this is what happened with
[25:31.320 --> 25:33.480]  the Occupy Wall Street I'm gonna go to break and come back with all the other
[25:33.480 --> 25:39.040]  news and it's big folks it's big Lord Monkton's joining us Zach Carter with

[26:00.160 --> 26:04.560]  breaking that down with a Zach Carter in the last 30 minutes today shattering the
[26:04.560 --> 26:08.360]  left-right paradigm getting past all this race business and down to real
[26:08.360 --> 26:12.600]  fundamentals and how the world really works that's what the system is scared
[26:12.600 --> 26:18.280]  to death of okay we all want freedom everybody has a light of liberty in
[26:18.280 --> 26:23.560]  their eyes who's ever been exposed to it or ever discovered it that's what was

[26:26.760 --> 26:32.520]  religion creed they're wanting freedom there with their children a lot of

[26:41.000 --> 26:45.080]  globalist play us off against each other that would be a travesty of justice
[26:45.080 --> 26:50.480]  now I want to get into some big economic news golden chance to win back
[26:50.480 --> 26:53.520]  power from EU that's one of the headlines a lot of world government has
[26:53.520 --> 26:57.000]  now been admitted a lot of inside baseball some really huge issues that's
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.400]  why Lord Monkton's joining us but I'll get to some of that before and some of
[27:01.400 --> 27:06.920]  the other news before for our guest joins us and some big military NATO news as
[27:06.920 --> 27:15.800]  well but it is a shame that they typecast the Tea Party and and try to
[27:15.800 --> 27:20.400]  have the Republicans take it over and they did to a certain extent and they
[27:20.400 --> 27:24.360]  but they had to pay a big price for that Rick Perry had to act like Ron Paul in
[27:24.360 --> 27:31.980]  Bad Mouth of fellow reserve others had to now they've seen in Herman Cain and he's
[27:31.980 --> 27:35.320]  trying to fool Republicans that a whole new taxing system on top of the income
[27:35.320 --> 27:40.400]  taxes really a way to you know but be conservative I mean give me a break it's
[27:40.400 --> 27:44.840]  new taxes to the banksters the same ones that gave us the income tax in 1913 this
[27:44.840 --> 27:49.080]  is so transparent when you're awake and informed and it's hard to watch people
[27:49.080 --> 27:56.280]  so ignorant but we do need to spank occupy Wall Street because it is quickly
[27:56.280 --> 28:02.080]  being shy opt and quickly taken over by Democratic Party operatives who are
[28:02.080 --> 28:06.200]  being very deceptive and saying we're not Democratic Party operatives we're
[28:06.200 --> 28:13.440]  from move on org and we're from Soros and we're from these big unions now let's
[28:13.440 --> 28:18.520]  march to the Koch brothers house that you know the conservative family that
[28:18.520 --> 28:24.720]  gives money to conservative causes let's go after Rupert Murdoch you know
[28:24.720 --> 28:29.080]  that's in the news today marching to their houses and saying we want your
[28:29.080 --> 28:34.520]  money well last time I checked the Koch brothers didn't take any bank or bailout
[28:34.520 --> 28:37.800]  money last time I checked Rupert Murdoch gives money to Republicans and
[28:37.800 --> 28:41.600]  Democrats but it's known as a as being a Republican because he is there to
[28:41.600 --> 28:46.200]  monopolize that movement and control it but you guys are in there going after
[28:46.200 --> 28:49.760]  one of your best people who's helped make sure conservatives never woke up and
[28:49.760 --> 28:53.520]  took this country back he's in the same bed as Obama there to make sure
[28:53.520 --> 28:58.440]  liberals never wake up but if you look at the list there's a list of what six
[28:58.440 --> 29:02.960]  groups six feet six billionaires in New York they're all Republicans every one
[29:02.960 --> 29:08.400]  of them is known as a Republican oh but this isn't Democratic you want to play
[29:08.400 --> 29:12.320]  that Psyop that you're the grassroots show that everybody who's in the grassroots
[29:12.320 --> 29:20.120]  thinks that Obama and the and the Federal Reserve agenda is grassroots you

[29:23.720 --> 29:27.320]  make it grassroots to think that the Democratic Party hidden bought and paid
[29:27.320 --> 29:30.560]  for by the most corrupt elements of Wall Street that'd be the private
[29:30.560 --> 29:34.280]  Federal Reserve people keep asking me Alex why not just go after Goldman Sachs

[33:12.480 --> 33:17.000]  more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages

[33:21.280 --> 33:25.960]  misforn little creature who has no purpose here no meaning I am a human
[33:25.960 --> 33:33.320]  being words mr. Wordsworth they have no substance and no dimension like air like
[33:33.320 --> 33:40.040]  a wind I don't care I tell you I don't care I'm a human being I exist if I
[33:40.040 --> 33:46.280]  speak one for a love that lives even after I'm shoveled in my grave
[33:46.280 --> 33:53.160]  delusions mr. Wordsworth delusions that you inject into your veins to make you
[33:53.160 --> 33:57.520]  think you have a strength when you have no strength at all you have nothing but
[33:57.520 --> 34:04.760]  spit me into the dream and the state has no use for your crime resistance to
[34:04.760 --> 34:17.240]  tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones we are back live it is Tuesday the
[34:17.240 --> 34:25.560]  11th day of October 2011 Adam Kokesh confronted in public by the Royal
[34:25.560 --> 34:30.960]  Occupied DC people who previously called for authoritarian rule and total wealth
[34:30.960 --> 34:35.960]  confiscation in the civilization of America Michael more of cars saying the
[34:35.960 --> 34:38.440]  same thing
[34:38.600 --> 34:44.360]  Kokesh told he can't videotape in America in public and now we're being told
[34:44.360 --> 34:49.760]  the same thing our reporters our listeners all over the United States you
[34:49.760 --> 34:54.240]  take your stink and Ron Paul and you get out of here we're going to march now to
[34:54.240 --> 34:58.300]  Republican billionaires houses and we're going to praise tax increases in the
[34:58.300 --> 35:01.960]  Obama agenda and then every time you criticize this we're going to say we
[35:01.960 --> 35:07.800]  don't have any political view how dare you be partisan this is incredible I
[35:07.800 --> 35:11.600]  remember two years ago seeing Republicans try to kick out Ron Paul
[35:11.600 --> 35:15.920]  supporters at tea party events across the country saying don't try to take over
[35:15.920 --> 35:20.760]  our movement a movement started by Ron Paul supporters in Austin Texas and
[35:20.760 --> 35:27.280]  Boston Massachusetts it's the same thing I I've had the Occupied Fed people send
[35:27.280 --> 35:31.080]  emails I've seen videos they've done saying we don't want you here Alex Jones
[35:31.080 --> 35:35.560]  co-opting our Occupied Wall Street I don't want to co-opt your movement for
[35:35.560 --> 35:42.160]  collectivism I'm there saying we've been protesting the Fed for decades or
[35:42.160 --> 35:46.800]  decades and we're pointing out to the public who is concerned about the real
[35:46.800 --> 35:51.760]  threat that we better get out there and get media attention on the real threat
[35:51.760 --> 35:57.520]  not some general nebulous thing about let's raise taxes on the rich which is
[35:57.520 --> 36:03.480]  exactly what the Federal Reserve we just type in Federal Reserve calls for
[36:03.480 --> 36:08.880]  value-added tax type in Council on Foreign Relations which basically is the
[36:08.880 --> 36:12.880]  political arm of the Federal Reserve calls for a VAT or national sales tax
[36:12.880 --> 36:16.960]  in fact show people right now please just type in Council on Foreign Relations
[36:16.960 --> 36:23.920]  national VAT is needed to pay off debt CFR calls for national VAT Federal
[36:23.920 --> 36:27.920]  Reserve calls for national VAT I mean they're saying to pay off the debt you
[36:27.920 --> 36:34.840]  owe America we need this and this is the Federal Reserve that maneuvered us the
[36:34.840 --> 36:40.020]  wealthiest country in the world 50 years ago to now the biggest debtor nation we
[36:40.020 --> 36:43.680]  had half the world's wealth just a few decades ago now we're a giant debtor
[36:43.680 --> 36:50.520]  nation all stolen through fraud and that they've got 20 30% of the people on
[36:50.520 --> 36:53.840]  some type of government assistance that they can now use as their dependence as
[36:53.840 --> 36:59.680]  their army and they've now deployed these people onto the streets who are
[36:59.680 --> 37:06.160]  ignorant to say raise taxes and I've got to watch every major neocon talk show
[37:06.160 --> 37:10.280]  hosts call for VAT and sales taxes to pay off quote what we owe when it's not
[37:10.280 --> 37:14.680]  our debt 90 plus percent of it I got to watch Herman came the former head of the
[37:14.680 --> 37:19.240]  Kansas City Federal Reserve an extremely high-level position that's almost as
[37:19.240 --> 37:22.920]  high as it gets you got the head of the New York Fed that's about all there is
[37:22.920 --> 37:30.840]  above it and what's he calling for a sales tax on top of the income tax and
[37:30.840 --> 37:34.800]  the social security tax those will just be lowered at first but I tell you for
[37:34.800 --> 37:39.440]  16 years the plan is they're gonna sell you on a VAT or sales tax to get rid of
[37:39.440 --> 37:44.840]  the income tax and they're gonna keep all of them I know them I know the enemy
[37:44.840 --> 37:49.920]  I eat sleep and drink them because I saw what they did in 1913 we got to get a
[37:49.920 --> 37:58.960]  report out on this they came on said we just want a 1% tax on millionaires which
[37:58.960 --> 38:02.920]  were billionaires of the day of course the Rockefellers on record were worth
[38:02.920 --> 38:07.080]  about three billionth the time that that would be in trillions today and of
[38:07.080 --> 38:10.360]  course they wrote the whole thing and they had loopholes where they were exempt
[38:10.360 --> 38:13.720]  from it until World War two and they say expanded it as a withholding on
[38:13.720 --> 38:18.840]  everybody is a wartime tax and by the 50s they jacked up those taxes something
[38:18.840 --> 38:24.520]  fierce his Americans were patriotic so they started taxing auto plant workers
[38:24.520 --> 38:35.440]  50% income tax oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah and they're gonna bring all that back
[38:35.440 --> 38:45.160]  again all of you people just like the fools that went and tried to get Obama
[38:45.160 --> 38:47.520]  elected I'm not saying McCain would have been good either that's how they
[38:47.520 --> 38:51.520]  control it so Don King controls a fight he owns both fighters point is you thought
[38:51.520 --> 38:55.000]  oh thank you mr. president when he was president elect I'll soon get a free car
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.520]  free house everything free free education and Obama would go along with it
[38:59.520 --> 39:05.480]  say you bet I'm gonna get for you free did you get all that free let me tell you
[39:05.480 --> 39:09.720]  something this whole George Soros thing this whole globalist war and
[39:09.720 --> 39:14.840]  Buffett thing with these wicked old men Soros has been convicted in multiple
[39:14.840 --> 39:18.920]  countries he just lost his appeal in France for crimes of ripping people off

[39:33.960 --> 39:37.480]  told he's a humanitarian and he's a guy that owns organizations and media
[39:37.480 --> 39:41.960]  outlets that attack this radio show every day and send private detectives
[39:41.960 --> 39:47.920]  around trying to find dirt on them yours truly and they can't find it because it

[43:36.760 --> 43:41.800]  trash their own minion Barack Obama I'm gonna be covering that later that's a
[43:41.800 --> 43:45.480]  big deal we've now reached that point California Governor is saying they're
[43:45.480 --> 43:53.400]  gonna protect warrantless wiretapping of cell phones also they're gonna go ahead
[43:53.400 --> 43:56.960]  with the blind the kids and saying it's the law to take shots and giving them
[43:56.960 --> 44:01.320]  shots without parental consent that's really what they're doing over there we've
[44:01.320 --> 44:05.840]  got the Occupy agitators attempt to ban First Amendment
[44:07.040 --> 44:18.120]  there's also another big article that Paul Watson did today that's very
[44:18.120 --> 44:22.040]  important that needs to get more attention Vera sign we need to even
[44:22.040 --> 44:28.160]  document cam over here vera sign demands power to kill abusive websites I
[44:28.160 --> 44:33.920]  need to get to that manager of all.com
[44:34.280 --> 44:38.480]  Internet addresses seeks authority to terminate domains on government order
[44:38.480 --> 44:45.360]  without legal oversight no judge no jury just the agency say it it happens
[44:45.360 --> 44:54.360]  unbelievable information and I want to break down for everybody listening
[44:54.360 --> 45:00.720]  they've announced scores of new bank fees not just the $5 fee with Bank of
[45:00.720 --> 45:08.200]  America every time you use your debit card you use your debit card to pay for
[45:08.200 --> 45:12.040]  gas you don't like having a credit card being in debt credit card as well they
[45:12.040 --> 45:20.360]  charge you $5 the cashless society is a trap once everything's cashless once
[45:20.360 --> 45:23.920]  they make you do automatic transfer there's always been a plan once they
[45:23.920 --> 45:28.920]  make you have a bank account sometimes you've got to have bank accounts now to
[45:28.920 --> 45:35.320]  even rent a car whatever once you're in their system now they can devalue the
[45:35.320 --> 45:40.240]  currency how they want they can trap you and and and and and put fines and fees
[45:40.240 --> 45:45.840]  on everything and they're getting rid of the retail division of banking they're
[45:45.840 --> 45:50.160]  phasing it out laying off per megabank tens of thousands and they've laid off
[45:50.160 --> 45:53.400]  fifty something thousand just the last six months at Bank of America and it's
[45:53.400 --> 45:59.200]  all in their retail division because the global central banks can issue and
[45:59.200 --> 46:04.600]  print tens of trillions at will less than 1% of the money out there is in
[46:04.600 --> 46:10.040]  physical paper it's a hassle for them to even deal with it in the old days for
[46:10.040 --> 46:15.120]  every dollar in the bank they could loan out 10 that's fractional reserve banking
[46:15.120 --> 46:19.480]  in Europe it was for every dollar they could loan out 8 of every euro or every
[46:19.480 --> 46:25.760]  mark whatever it was at the time now it's like hey you don't get it you're
[46:25.760 --> 46:29.920]  going to have to be digital and cashless because that's how all businesses now
[46:29.920 --> 46:34.320]  basically set up and when you do it you're gonna pay tolls every step of the
[46:34.320 --> 46:38.600]  way your little prisoners now and by the way we're gonna track everything you do
[46:38.600 --> 46:43.680]  in real-time and sell it to hundreds of corporations in the government
[46:45.120 --> 46:52.800]  Facebook Google pizza places everything the only way to fight this is only by
[46:52.800 --> 46:57.240]  from small companies and try to go cashless as much as possible but I'll
[46:57.240 --> 47:01.640]  tell you this they've gotten now around 90% of transactions cashless and so if
[47:01.640 --> 47:05.960]  we weren't in the cashless society right now I mean how do you fight the
[47:05.960 --> 47:10.160]  matrix you jack into it if we weren't in the matrix ourselves we wouldn't be in
[47:10.160 --> 47:14.000]  the game I don't know somebody comes along with three four million dollars a
[47:14.000 --> 47:19.000]  year gives me that cash on the barrelhead I can phase out a lot of our
[47:19.000 --> 47:27.840]  cashless systems but I it's still digital online virtual and they're now
[47:27.840 --> 47:32.720]  announcing I'm gonna get to this later bear a sign demands power to kill abuse
[47:32.720 --> 47:37.800]  of websites no judge no jury and you already see in cases where they'll
[47:37.800 --> 47:41.120]  want to shut down one gambling site even another country and they'll just shut
[47:41.120 --> 47:45.520]  down 50,000 websites at an entire giant server company and the feds just haul it
[47:45.520 --> 47:50.880]  all off and don't even apologize and even city websites are down county websites
[47:50.880 --> 47:57.000]  they don't care and the Justice Department just does it a bunch of lawless
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.560]  narcotics traffickers Justice Department caught again authorizing Sena
[48:00.560 --> 48:04.820]  Lowe and others to ship in tens of tons a month a cocaine other drugs shipping

[48:44.480 --> 48:54.520]  mafia of hardcore criminals and that's why I have no respect for any of these
[48:54.520 --> 48:57.880]  badges or any of these groups you know that FBI show up here before for
[48:57.880 --> 49:01.280]  internet stuff or whatever and secret service before and I just look at them
[49:01.280 --> 49:04.640]  and I say I have no respect for you you work for an agency of narcotics

[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:09.960]  getting attention in the news up in Dallas and they've had another big

[1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:51.280]  Federal Reserve the movement's draw attention to the cartel of private
[1:01:51.280 --> 1:01:57.000]  bankers fraudulently masquerading as a federal agency is going strong I probably
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  to add to this article that hey you know I've called for people to continue to
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.320]  protest fellow reserve locations to continue because now more than ever we've
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:10.440]  a got to try to go to Occupy Wall Street to say hey would you like to go after who
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:14.640]  actually did this economically would you actually like to get out of this or do
[1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:18.640]  you just want to get conned and pay trillions more in VAT taxes like Herman
[1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:23.880]  Cain once and George Soros and Warren Buffett want and Bill Gates wants to
[1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:28.120]  the Federal Reserve because that's what the very same ECB European Central Bank
[1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:31.960]  in Europe same shareholders is setting up there to rape people and they've just
[1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:35.280]  dispensed with it's for the poor they're like we run things we're holding you
[1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:40.480]  financially hostage we control your finance ministers we're doing it shut up
[1:02:40.480 --> 1:02:43.960]  we have troops standing by with machine guns and if you don't go along with us
[1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:48.560]  it's over so again talking to all the folks that are out there I want to make
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:56.160]  it clear we're talking to Adam Kokesh about in a moment but it is essential who
[1:02:56.160 --> 1:03:01.760]  knows I'll probably I've just got to pick a time to drive to the Dallas enjoying
[1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:06.240]  people as I said if people stayed there and it was a good numbers I would go up
[1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:09.680]  there that I would at least send to reporters it's just then I start thinking
[1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:13.600]  about how much more good I can do doing the radio doing the TV and I've also got
[1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:17.160]  some other things I want to do on the road but they're just doing an incredible
[1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:21.600]  job up there so please get to the Dallas Fed if you can just stay 24 hours
[1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:26.160]  that's great or if you know you're gonna motel for a couple days and stay there
[1:03:26.160 --> 1:03:29.680]  when you can the power of people out there with signs freaks out these
[1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:33.360]  globalists they know every demonstrator represents a thousand to ten thousand
[1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:37.480]  people depending on which actuary they look at especially for conservative
[1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:42.040]  constitutional libertarian types they know that those statistically are not
[1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:46.200]  the types that are joiners or protesters they know that they know once you blow
[1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:52.400]  your top you do a 1776 we've got to not let the George Soros people take over
[1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:56.160]  opposition to government corruption and corporate corruption and then call for
[1:03:56.160 --> 1:04:01.200]  exactly what the globalists want also on this video page somebody's posted I
[1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:04.920]  guess American Phoenix 57 has put posted a lot of quotes that by the way I do
[1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:08.240]  know are from the actual publications because I've vetted these very quotes
[1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:13.360]  before here's a quote of the day we're likely to do better by building our
[1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:17.360]  house of world order from the bottom up rather than from the top down an in
[1:04:17.360 --> 1:04:21.880]  run around national sovereignty eroding at piece by piece is likely to get us to
[1:04:21.880 --> 1:04:27.080]  world order faster than the old-fashioned assault I think you misquote

[1:06:10.160 --> 1:06:15.280]  listeners to do three things right away number one study the past history

[1:07:18.400 --> 1:07:23.040]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:27.360]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:32.640]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:36.960]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists

[1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:56.760]  info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[1:07:56.760 --> 1:08:04.160]  prisonplanet.tv Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the
[1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:10.040]  Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:22.480]  okay coming up Lord Christopher Monkton is joining us at the bottom of the hour
[1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:28.120]  to talk about huge developments in Europe John Major the former British
[1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:32.840]  Prime Minister has come out and admitted that part of the Maastricht Treaty that
[1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:37.720]  brought England into the euro exempted the city of London itself just like the
[1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:43.200]  Vatican from the EU and that this new super Europe being set up in a financial
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:49.440]  you'll banks for takeover will actually get rid of the sovereignty of even the
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:55.320]  city of London and he's saying instead of that they should basically demand a
[1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:59.720]  vote and either get out of the euro entirely because now it's going to be
[1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:03.640]  German and Vatican dominated that's what Tony Blair's run over to Europe and you
[1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:07.320]  know been involved in all of this and that the city of London will lose its
[1:09:07.320 --> 1:09:12.360]  power it'll move to Frankfurt and that's what's happening you've got inter
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:16.640]  globalist fighting going on I've got it in the Daily Mail I've got it in
[1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:21.400]  financial times of London golden chance to win power back from EU financial
[1:09:21.400 --> 1:09:26.640]  times of London reclaim power from EU says major but but again hidden in here
[1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:29.840]  it admits all the world government stuff Sir John Major on telegraph
[1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:33.800]  Britain should negotiate for a looser form of Europe and he gets into the
[1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:37.560]  inside baseball of the Maastricht Treaty this is just incredible they're
[1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:40.560]  talking about the euro completely collapsing within a month if they don't
[1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:43.280]  get all these new powers that's a bunch of bull they're just holding people
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:51.240]  hostage that is all coming up today and then we've got a fellow involved with
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:55.160]  KRS one who we've had on the show and I get back on and of course the moral
[1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:58.640]  technique and others that they're announcing a big national tour by hip
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:03.560]  hop artists are predominantly black folks for Ron Paul this is big news and so I
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:07.120]  want to get behind this and support it very exciting shattering a left-right
[1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:11.360]  paradigm shattering the racial divide it's all about liberty it's about what's
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:15.160]  in your heart what's in your mind not about what color your skin is and by
[1:10:15.160 --> 1:10:19.960]  the way we've confirmed in San Antonio and in other cities from my reporters
[1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:24.440]  but also echoed by our listeners that people show up and move on comes in
[1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:31.440]  George Soros groups SEIC SEI you all those different stupid unions the
[1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:36.920]  service unions they come in there and they create racial division they create
[1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:43.160]  you know they bring it up they inject it then they say no Ron Paul Matt Medina
[1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:47.840]  has confirmed it in San Antonio they tell him no Ron Paul signs there Darren
[1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:52.200]  McBrain our reporter has confirmed his son was out at the Occupy Wall Street
[1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:56.400]  here in Austin yesterday they said do not bring your Ron Paul sign here we're
[1:10:56.400 --> 1:10:59.600]  confirming this nationwide they're telling people the Federal Reserve is
[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:04.680]  good leave it alone the Federal Reserve is the inside crony anti-capitalist
[1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:08.120]  they're called crony capitalist but they're not capitalist the crony
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:13.080]  monopoly mafia men that have taken over our country bankrupted it and that
[1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:17.800]  masquerades of federal agency now a few weeks ago week and a half ago was the
[1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:21.280]  top drudge link biggest link you can get on the internet that's exciting as it
[1:11:21.280 --> 1:11:26.480]  exposed the early on attempt to co-opt Occupy Wall Street we documented the
[1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:31.040]  Democratic affiliated groups months ago called for an Occupy Wall Street movement
[1:11:31.040 --> 1:11:35.840]  coming up in October just like the Soviet October Revolution and they want
[1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:39.880]  collectivism like Michael Moore the guy worth hundreds of millions says get rid
[1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:43.360]  of capitalism that means your private property they want higher taxes something
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:46.520]  the big banks one because they end up getting most haven't bail out money they
[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:50.360]  want VAT and sales tax what Herman Keynes promoting in Europe they're
[1:11:50.360 --> 1:11:54.920]  promoting expansions of that to pay off the derivatives debt we don't owe so
[1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:59.320]  we're at this point now will the bankers be able to con people into going along
[1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:04.240]  with their next phase of tyranny and that you now have Occupy Wall Street
[1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:09.000]  marching to the Koch brothers and five other clean Rupert Murdoch Republican
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:15.880]  billionaires so again the message is Republicans are bad money is bad not
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:21.040]  corrupt groups with government getting taxpayer money that's what's bankrupting
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:26.400]  us the globalists are purposely destroying our sovereignty to bring in
[1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:30.480]  this world government I mean John majors come out and warned England is about the
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:33.640]  UK is about to completely lose all its sovereignty that's coming up with Lord
[1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:37.080]  Monkton in about 20 minutes from now but I want to go to Adam Cookest joining
[1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:42.000]  us via via video Skype because we wrote an article about them coming up and
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.680]  saying we want authoritarianism we want the power of the state we want to shut
[1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:49.800]  down freedom basically we're authoritarian people simple that's out of
[1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:54.600]  context well I'm getting that all over the country now okay now we've got a new
[1:12:54.600 --> 1:12:58.960]  video he shot Occupy agitators attempt to ban First Amendment foul mouth
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:03.000]  collectivists don't want their creepy consensus meetings being filmed Paul
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:10.720]  Joseph Watson at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and it's got in it the
[1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:15.160]  video that we can't play here like the other one this so foul mouth so gibbering
[1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:18.560]  that we can't play it but you can go watch it if you want this is a family
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:24.360]  show plus we're on aim and FM under FCC rules but the gibbering person and
[1:13:24.360 --> 1:13:28.160]  others are saying you're not going to film our event and so to break this down
[1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:33.800]  is Adam Cookest show boy this sounds like court site Arizona where they try to
[1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:37.440]  ban free speech I mean this doesn't sound like the super democracy people
[1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:41.920]  Adam say thank you so much for having me on and for getting to the heart of
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:46.200]  what's really at these occupation movements because the core rallying
[1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:54.320]  cry is the 99% versus the 1% and a lot of libertarians hear that and a lot of
[1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:57.560]  people like you and me who have our world you hear that they go yeah that's
[1:13:57.560 --> 1:14:02.680]  that's right there's that 1% that is that is super rich and a lot of them are
[1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:06.640]  benefiting because of bailout because of handouts because of corporatism because
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:11.160]  of the Federal Reserve system because of what our government is doing but there
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:16.280]  is a fundamental flaw here and it's not just that this movement is being
[1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:22.120]  co-opted by liberal establishment leadership it's more than that this
[1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:27.520]  movement is fundamentally status at its heart because it is not saying let's
[1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:33.760]  look at the mooters versus the producers the people versus the exploiters no it's
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:40.520]  the successful versus the 99% and now a lot of that 1% like I said is in that
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:45.800]  1% only because of government action because of government welfare to
[1:14:45.800 --> 1:14:51.080]  corporations to the military industrial complex to the financial industry but
[1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:55.800]  there are a lot of people who are at these demonstrations who are motivated
[1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:59.400]  by this rallying cry and the primary kinds of people that are motivated by
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:04.000]  this rallying cry are the kinds of left statists I don't like the left right
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:08.840]  divide but these are left statists these are people who want to turn to the
[1:15:08.840 --> 1:15:12.160]  government for solutions to problems that were created by the government in the
[1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:16.800]  first place and they are unwilling to admit that what they are talking about is
[1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:21.800]  just as bad as what we have today that what they are asking for is for more
[1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:25.760]  force to be applied for more government intervention Adam it's actually worse
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:29.960]  and of course the left right exists in the false paradigm so of course if you
[1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:35.000]  have to address them as leftist hardcore authoritarians they're calling for the
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:40.240]  equivalent of the October Revolution in 1917 there's lots of beheading talk lots
[1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:45.800]  of authoritarianism lots of wealth confiscation talk and lots of
[1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:50.320]  establishment talking points free education free health care blah blah
[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:54.920]  blah that you can only get through total degradation total slavery trading out
[1:15:54.920 --> 1:16:00.680]  Federal Reserve commas ours for the new commas ours and the new apirachic but on
[1:16:00.680 --> 1:16:07.480]  top of it we've got George Soros we've got Warren Buffett all wanting new Banker
[1:16:07.480 --> 1:16:11.800]  bailout money all wanting new VAT sales taxes Herman Cain on the fake controlled
[1:16:11.800 --> 1:16:16.200]  right calling for a sales tax to pay off our debt when it's not our debt I mean
[1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:20.160]  you got the whole system selling the same Kool-Aid just with different flavors
[1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:27.800]  and it and now I've confirmed Adam in Austin in San Antonio in Colorado all
[1:16:27.800 --> 1:16:32.200]  over the country they are coming over and saying you get your Ron Paul thing
[1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:36.360]  out of here and literally going like this so now that maybe three weeks ago it
[1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:42.360]  wasn't co-opted but now it is no doubt a bunch of dangerous rabble that doesn't
[1:16:42.360 --> 1:16:47.000]  mean everybody is but those getting the attention those leading it they they are
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:52.880]  they get there after one group and that's after libertarians constitutionalist
[1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:58.920]  well Alex as amazing as as your job of analyzing this has been and I've been
[1:16:58.920 --> 1:17:02.840]  going to infowars.com for a lot of my background on this for getting a sense
[1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:06.960]  of what's going on in the larger national scene I think the one thing that
[1:17:06.960 --> 1:17:12.400]  that most people are still missing is that it's not just being co-opted you
[1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:18.240]  can't even say that a few weeks ago it was something legitimately beautiful
[1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:22.480]  grassroots freedom fighting it was always from the beginning it was this
[1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:25.600]  fundamental rage I mean this is the what the protesters have been saying it is
[1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:30.840]  their rage and it is a rage that is coming from resentment of success that
[1:17:30.840 --> 1:17:34.400]  is coming from liberalism and like you said they're calling for an October
[1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:38.760]  revolution style thing but you know what the October revolution actually had a
[1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:42.800]  huge one up on what's going on in America today because most of the people
[1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:46.760]  in the streets aren't willing to face up to the fact that it is their messiah it
[1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:51.960]  is the one that they voted for it is Barack Obama who was responsible for
[1:17:51.960 --> 1:17:55.640]  those who they say in the one exactly at least the Bolsheviks were going after
[1:17:55.640 --> 1:17:58.920]  the czars which was another form of tyranny in this case they're just
[1:17:58.920 --> 1:18:02.920]  milling around thinking Obama's going to save him from Wall Street when he's
[1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:06.920]  represented by the corrupt elements and and you're absolutely right Adam it is
[1:18:06.920 --> 1:18:11.920]  disgusting to hate success a top race car driver a top painter a top computer
[1:18:11.920 --> 1:18:15.800]  programmer somebody like you know Steve Jobs who actually did develop things
[1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:19.720]  you can get you know criticize the Chinese slave labor it is you're right
[1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:25.520]  it's this anger at people who have done well in life and it's really scary do
[1:18:25.520 --> 1:18:29.360]  you agree with Rand Paul then that this from what you've seen in DC and New York
[1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:36.320]  does have a true French Revolution flavor rather than a 1776 flavor absolutely
[1:18:36.320 --> 1:18:40.000]  not you know I'm not gonna try to make the historical comparisons I'm not an
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:45.400]  expert but what this is doing is separating us from the real divide the
[1:18:45.400 --> 1:18:48.640]  real philosophical divide in this country in this world when it comes to
[1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:51.680]  matters of government and power and control which is that it's not about
[1:18:51.680 --> 1:18:56.480]  those who benefit the most from the corrupt evil system it's the corrupt
[1:18:56.480 --> 1:19:03.080]  evil system itself and it doesn't exist because banksters sponsor it because
[1:19:03.080 --> 1:19:07.520]  corporations corrupted it exists because there are people like those in the
[1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:10.920]  street at Occupy Wall Street right now there are people like it in the street
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:14.920]  in Occupy DC and all over the country now there are some libertarian pockets
[1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:18.200]  there are some libertarians who out there doing great work you have occupied
[1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:22.360]  the Fed and Dallas and in Minnesota there's a slightly different kind of
[1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:25.720]  occupation going on there really is libertarian driven but it is between
[1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:29.600]  people like these in the streets who are who really make up the bulk and the
[1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:34.240]  driving force of this movement who want government to solve problems who want to
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:38.920]  mooch off exactly and then all that does is creates a bigger vacuum for the
[1:19:38.920 --> 1:19:42.880]  foreign banks to suck up our wealth these idiots don't get it big government
[1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:46.640]  doesn't work all it does is gang rape you Adam Kukesh I want to talk about more
[1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:51.280]  of what you've seen from these people on the streets because because I mean
[1:19:51.280 --> 1:19:56.240]  there's no doubt now they're calling for an October style revolution and they
[1:19:56.240 --> 1:19:59.160]  want me to basically be their slave I guess and work in some slave pit for
[1:19:59.160 --> 1:20:05.120]  them what happened man you used to be energetic happy and wow did the ladies
[1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:09.800]  love you now you fall asleep on the couch irritable and out of shape don't be
[1:20:09.800 --> 1:20:14.960]  that guy call now for a risk-free trial of ageless male a natural supplement
[1:20:14.960 --> 1:20:20.520]  shown to raise testosterone by 61% and maintain healthy normal levels no

[1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:39.080]  minutes left Adam I mean I really get what you're saying here I tried to be
[1:24:39.080 --> 1:24:41.800]  friendly with these people at least the leaders of it they claim there's no
[1:24:41.800 --> 1:24:45.520]  leaders that's a lie it's democratic operatives they don't want that to be
[1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:49.560]  known though now they admit it's come out internal documents this is the Obama
[1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:54.440]  reelection strategy the Federal Reserve has endorsed them I mean what more do we
[1:24:54.440 --> 1:24:58.480]  need to know these are people begging the government for something which is
[1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:03.000]  fundamentally the wrong answer big government has gotten us into this
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:08.520]  position now you've been down amongst these people and bottom line who leads
[1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:12.640]  them who directs them what other authoritarian stuff have you heard them
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:19.400]  say well remember like with the tea party in order for it to be co-optable by
[1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:23.680]  the Republican Party there had to be some kind of connection there so for it
[1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:29.360]  in order for this thing to be co-optable by these left forces it is it has to be
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:32.680]  fundamentally left leaning at its core and there are a lot of people there who
[1:25:32.680 --> 1:25:38.080]  are really just being led real real sheep who are getting into these group
[1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:44.240]  calling repeat general assemblies this consensus decision-making and it in these
[1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:49.200]  things and I've actually been involved in in some meetings like this and it's
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:54.160]  an interesting organizing technique but it doesn't work for things like this
[1:25:54.160 --> 1:25:58.920]  except to make it vulnerable to anybody who wants to co-opt them and that's
[1:25:58.920 --> 1:26:02.720]  that's really kind of the dangerous thing about this is that anybody who can
[1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:06.600]  get in there and take charge and stand up with the loudest voice and sort of run
[1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:11.600]  the equivalent of their parliamentary process can really take charge and really
[1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:15.320]  co-opted and and move it in their direction but I want to direct people to
[1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:18.040]  another video that I put out because you've been mentioning the one where
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:22.360]  where I'm blocked from filming this event in DC and and their disregard for the
[1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:25.640]  first amendment fundamentally when they disagree with someone exercising their
[1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:29.480]  first amendment rights is really disgraceful but a lot of the followers
[1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:32.640]  and you're not going to win over the heart of this movement we're not going
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:35.720]  to do it with the message of liberty we're not going to get it out by going
[1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:40.560]  out and shaking hands or no no no no now they're saying you can have your union
[1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:46.080]  signs you can call for socialism do not bring it in the Fed or on Paul that is
[1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:50.000]  the cross to them I mean and that tells you everything you know about these
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:53.880]  folks well that's that's coming from the leadership and the thing is a lot of the
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:56.520]  people that are there that are just showing up that really don't know better
[1:26:56.520 --> 1:27:02.320]  are going along with that but a good chunk of them are very very easily won
[1:27:02.320 --> 1:27:06.840]  over now this is still a very small part of the population remember this is you
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:10.480]  know what I've heard the biggest number I've heard at all out of the whole thing
[1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:14.440]  was 20,000 people in New York which is significant but really on a regular basis
[1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:18.640]  it's a couple of thousand here and there you know now yeah see how the mainstream
[1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:22.480]  media is giving a massive attention that's another big tip-off right well it
[1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:25.680]  is it is an interesting conversation it's an important conversation this is why
[1:27:25.680 --> 1:27:28.920]  I'm talking about it because there are a lot of people there who are just kind of
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:33.800]  going along to get along following along but who are genuinely angry and upset
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:37.000]  with with the state of the economy the state of the country and the exploitation
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:40.400]  and they haven't quite put the pieces together yet there's another video on my
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:44.760]  YouTube channel called surprise you might be a wrong Paul supporter and it's
[1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:48.960]  relatively easy to convince some of these people to be won over but the
[1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:53.640]  driving force behind it never will be won over it is fundamentally anti-freedom
[1:27:53.640 --> 1:27:57.040]  it is vitriolic it is being run by people who think they can use the
[1:27:57.040 --> 1:28:00.040]  government to force their will on others that's what a lot of my videos have
[1:28:00.040 --> 1:28:05.000]  exposed so I do want to encourage Ron Paul supporters to get out there if they
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:09.040]  want because it's an all it's an opportunity for outreach but please do
[1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:12.640]  not mistake it for an opportunity to be a part of something because no matter
[1:28:12.640 --> 1:28:17.280]  what comes out of this you will not be happy with the outcome it will be more
[1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:20.880]  government control as you said Alex it's about increasing the control of
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:24.040]  government over the economy it's about feeding into the the the plans for
[1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:29.560]  globalism it's about getting rid of all of those individual protections that are
[1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:33.800]  supposed to be important in the United States that when they can't tell me what
[1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:37.840]  democracy looks like it's because they are fundamentally opposed to the idea
[1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:42.640]  of a republic which safeguards individual liberty they want mob rule for those
[1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:46.080]  who don't know as Thomas Jefferson Benjamin Franklin said in different
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:50.080]  permutations democracy's two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner and
[1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:53.280]  for folks that are drinking fluoride don't understand what that means two
[1:28:53.280 --> 1:28:57.320]  wolves are going to vote to eat the sheep in a republic that the sheep is
[1:28:57.320 --> 1:29:02.160]  protected from the wolves even if they both vote to eat the sheep and and
[1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:06.880]  that's what's so fundamentally dangerous about especially the DC folks you
[1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:13.400]  know the the Occupy Wall Street people in Houston were pretty good the ones in
[1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:17.160]  Dallas you said we're not coming here in the Fed thing and San Antonio they were
[1:29:17.160 --> 1:29:21.480]  outright saying we're the enemy so it's just pure idiocy and I really feel sorry
[1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:25.400]  for him Adam I want to continue to talk to you in the next week or two as this
[1:29:25.400 --> 1:29:29.520]  unfolds but when the Federal Reserve endorses it you better believe we know

[1:35:31.920 --> 1:35:36.360]  Telegraph today the evening standard and a lot more science and public policy dot
[1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:41.440]  org and eukip.org are the websites you can find out more about Lord Moncton now
[1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:45.600]  let's be clear here I'm not an Anglophile but having the last name
[1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:50.600]  Jones I've studied English history British history the British the whole
[1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:54.560]  nine yards quite a bit and that's also at the center of world history kind of
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:59.440]  the you know New Roman Empire so you could say coming out of England now we
[1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:05.280]  have the Euro being shut up by the Bilderberg group other globalist Margaret
[1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:10.320]  Thatcher spoke out against that through the Treaty of Rome 1957 now it's
[1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:14.000]  imploding Europe by design we predicted this years ago with our economist and
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:19.560]  calling for a private banking system to run it with the unelected Euro
[1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:31.920]  bureaucracy with total dictatorial power now I'm even hearing MSNBC I have even I
[1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:41.880]  have even heard MSNBC I have even heard here TV on my XM radio I've even heard
[1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:49.560]  Bloomberg CNBC others say it's horrible that Germany is a democracy and that
[1:36:49.560 --> 1:36:54.840]  they're allowed to vote because they may vote Merkel out they've almost voted her
[1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:58.880]  out twice it's parliamentary so she loses enough seats she's gone it's not
[1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:04.000]  like an up or down vote and boy this is terrible we need this financial
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.880]  dictatorship to save the world system but no matter how much you pump into
[1:37:07.880 --> 1:37:11.200]  these derivatives you can't prop them up how many economists have we had on it's
[1:37:11.200 --> 1:37:15.600]  over a thousand five hundred quadrillion one thousand five hundred trillion it's
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:20.360]  not our debt but they've got these giant groups of people that are dependent that
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:25.080]  burned half of England down a few months ago as you know wanting more you've got
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:28.520]  the people bringing in record immigrant populations demanding more more more
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:34.760]  seven million people wanting to come into the West and it's unsustainable and
[1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:38.080]  something incredible happens why Lord Moncton joins us and hopefully with us
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:41.200]  it's a little bit of the next hour so he can really have the floor and break
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:46.520]  this down but I have to preface all of this first daily mail financial times
[1:37:46.520 --> 1:37:50.360]  later I'll read some of the quotes but I want to go to him because of time
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:58.120]  London Telegraph all reporting he talks about the Maastricht Treaty and how that
[1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:02.200]  exempted the city of London within London the financial district kind of
[1:38:02.200 --> 1:38:06.360]  like the Vatican has its own city or DC has its own city or Israel's kind of
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:12.040]  become its own city state that is its own sovereign it was exempt but if this
[1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:16.080]  continues England is already most of their laws Moncton give me the exact
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:19.840]  number but the mainstream news over there says 70 plus percent are made by
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:24.760]  unelected bureaucrats even though the the UK people and and the Brits at the
[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:29.040]  center of it in England were never allowed to vote on it they were brought
[1:38:29.040 --> 1:38:32.920]  into it like most other EU members conquered financially through fraud and
[1:38:32.920 --> 1:38:39.480]  here's the Prime Minister David Cameron UK should stay in EU says Cameron he
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:42.720]  goes on to stay London independent it's also in BBC that he will try to block
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:49.800]  letting the UK England Scotland Ireland Northern Ireland vote on this so this is
[1:38:49.800 --> 1:38:54.360]  a big deal my dad called in this morning he said why aren't you covering this you
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:57.000]  know I read it yesterday I barely mentioned it but I didn't talk about it
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:00.600]  John majors come out so this is a great way to basically get out of the euro or
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:06.360]  to weaken the euro instead of getting more power and get UK sovereignty back so
[1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:12.200]  this this is a critical time for these people okay this unelected on out of the
[1:39:12.200 --> 1:39:16.760]  expert Lord Moncton joins us now to break down what the euro really is what
[1:39:16.760 --> 1:39:21.000]  it's doing this new power grab out of the crisis they've created and the
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:26.480]  extraordinary thing of John Major coming out former head of the Tories
[1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:31.800]  sounding more Margaret Thatcher-esque saying sovereignty get out of this
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:35.360]  world world government system he actually you know talks about it but then
[1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:40.840]  the other conservative you know current a conservative leader the current Tory is
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:45.160]  saying he will try to block the UK from actually having a say in its affairs
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:50.920]  very tyrannical so to bring us clarity is a big insider Lord Moncton is at the
[1:39:50.920 --> 1:39:55.680]  top of Downing Street is a top advisor a journalist in the middle of it heading
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:39:59.120]  up the UK Independence Party at the highest levels he can give you the pure
[1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:02.720]  inside on what's happening Lord Moncton thank you for joining us sorry about the
[1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:07.440]  six-minute preface but I wanted to really try to break down for Americans
[1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:11.960]  just how big this is I mean it sounds like you know Germany today the world
[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:18.760]  tomorrow Europe today the world tomorrow we're seeing this this tyranny a try to
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:25.440]  metastasize and I see a chance to kill the cancer now Lord Moncton well I'm
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:29.360]  very good that you introduce it as bluntly as that because it is a tyranny
[1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:35.640]  now the people of Britain want to get out they most certainly want to have a
[1:40:35.640 --> 1:40:42.200]  say on whether they stay in this monster or get out and of course David Cameron
[1:40:42.200 --> 1:40:47.440]  who pretended before the last election that he would give us a referendum on
[1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:53.080]  whether we stay in or come out has now decided that he wants to join the tyranny
[1:40:53.080 --> 1:40:58.040]  and therefore he won't give us the referendum which he promised us the
[1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:01.640]  Labour Party also promised us a referendum but they're not very keen on
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:06.200]  having one either the fact is that all the major political parties in Britain
[1:41:06.200 --> 1:41:10.880]  now have gone socialist they've gone fascist really I suppose is the word
[1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:15.360]  for it they no longer want the British people to have a say in British
[1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:21.320]  legislation to answer one question you raised it's five laws in six that are
[1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:27.640]  now made by or at the behest of the European dictatorship five out of six
[1:41:27.640 --> 1:41:34.680]  of our laws we have no say no vote no voice no power we are just told what
[1:41:34.680 --> 1:41:39.760]  the law is going to be and we have to salute and obey and John Major frankly
[1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:45.200]  it's time he woke up because it was he who by forcing Britain into the mass
[1:41:45.200 --> 1:41:49.440]  tricked treaty against the will of the British people against the will of his
[1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:54.400]  own party split the Conservative Party created UKIP in effect I mean the
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:59.280]  party was already in existence then but it was only when he forced us into the
[1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:04.480]  mass tricked treaty which finally gave away our independence that many people
[1:42:04.480 --> 1:42:08.840]  in the Conservative Party including me began to realize that the Conservative
[1:42:08.840 --> 1:42:14.680]  Party no longer cared about Britain's democracy so for him now to change
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:20.320]  around and say well maybe we should start taking back from Europe some of the
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:25.960]  powers which he gave to Europe that is a significant event as is the recent
[1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:32.080]  defection to UKIP of the former Conservative leader in the House of
[1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:37.240]  Lords very significant figure Lord Hesketh an immensely rich man and UKIP
[1:42:37.240 --> 1:42:41.720]  could always do with money he has now said he's joining UKIP because he's
[1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:46.160]  absolutely fed up to the back teeth with the Conservative Party no longer
[1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:51.040]  representing the people and it was he under the government of John Major that
[1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:56.160]  forced the mass tricked treaty through and prevented the House of Lords from
[1:42:56.160 --> 1:43:01.640]  demanding as many of us as my father at that time wished a referendum on the
[1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:08.240]  issue he fought that off so he too is a significant convert from the forces of
[1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:13.120]  darkness to the army of light and truth and what we are seeing now is almost a
[1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:19.360]  stampede out of the Tory Party and into UKIP because people have realized that
[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:24.400]  the Tory Party has now simply become another version of socialism it's if
[1:43:24.400 --> 1:43:28.920]  you like a softer bluer greener version of socialism but it's socialism red in
[1:43:28.920 --> 1:43:33.640]  tooth and claw for all that and socialism in essence means dictatorship it means
[1:43:33.640 --> 1:43:38.960]  taking power away from you and me and the ballot box and putting it into the
[1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:43.400]  hands of the great and the good the usual suspects and what these are very
[1:43:43.400 --> 1:43:48.280]  very significant changes Alex that are going on here this is a sea change I
[1:43:48.280 --> 1:43:52.680]  mean what's going to happen is that UKIP at each election gains a little in fact
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:56.920]  in European elections it's already the second largest British Party and with
[1:43:56.920 --> 1:44:01.200]  David Cameron making the kind of noises he's making now and with people like
[1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:05.320]  John Major a former Tory Prime Minister Lord Hesketh a former Tory leader in the
[1:44:05.320 --> 1:44:10.680]  Lord's joining UKIP in saying enough is enough this has gone too far this is
[1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:13.640]  going to mean that the next European election which comes up in two or three
[1:44:13.640 --> 1:44:20.160]  years time we might well become the largest British Party in the European
[1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:24.240]  Parliament that would be a very significant event certainly the trend of
[1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:28.560]  events is now moving towards us because if we move on if we made to the euro
[1:44:28.560 --> 1:44:33.960]  this failed project which I think was always designed to fail and you have
[1:44:33.960 --> 1:44:38.040]  also spotted this a long way back well they've admitted that in fact in fact
[1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:40.760]  hold on just a second Lord Moncton because I want to go back before you
[1:44:40.760 --> 1:44:44.840]  expand and continue for people living in North America living in the US the
[1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:49.640]  magnitude of this the same shareholders of the European Central Bank are you
[1:44:49.640 --> 1:44:53.880]  know the very same crew that runs our Federal Reserve that is endorsing the
[1:44:53.880 --> 1:44:59.800]  October Bolshevik Revolution here there's no doubt that's what the dominant
[1:44:59.800 --> 1:45:03.760]  groups running the Occupy Wall Street are calling for a collectivism a
[1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:08.920]  demonization of free market with the big mega banks pushing it wanting to use
[1:45:08.920 --> 1:45:14.200]  the unwashed crowd to scalp any any middle-class people that they haven't
[1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:19.880]  robbed yet so your fight is our fight and and and so so I was thinking I was
[1:45:19.880 --> 1:45:24.320]  correct reading this but you've confirmed that to have John Major come out
[1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:28.200]  and I mean these quotes are just astounding in the financial times and
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:33.000]  say we don't have a vote in Europe we need to get our sovereignty back we need
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:41.040]  to force this is a major power structure break and really shows a huge
[1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:44.760]  weakening of Prime Minister David Cameron and it's another example of how
[1:45:44.760 --> 1:45:49.160]  the fascist want to collectivize us down the farm while they sit back with all
[1:45:49.160 --> 1:45:53.720]  the wealth so it really is fascism sitting upon a collectivist model at the
[1:45:53.720 --> 1:45:57.000]  lower level that's what I've always seen from these people they want to make it
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:00.680]  like socialism fascism communism three different things really just three
[1:46:00.680 --> 1:46:05.760]  different flavors of the same cyanide kool-aid but to be specific here with my
[1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:13.120]  question is it what does this signify to have David Cameron come out and say I
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:18.680]  don't want you to be able to vote as we come to this moment of truth where all
[1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:22.640]  of Europe is told you will give up whatever sovereignty you have left to an
[1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:28.160]  unelected group who will levy taxes upon you I mean this this is far worse
[1:46:28.160 --> 1:46:32.360]  than what King George was doing to the colonies I mean this is such naked
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:37.040]  tyranny and they're not even lying anymore saying we're going to do this
[1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:41.920]  so we can give you your free welfare and you know they're saying in Europe we
[1:46:41.920 --> 1:46:46.400]  will give you financial devastation unless you capitulate I mean this is so
[1:46:46.400 --> 1:46:53.520]  Hitlerian well I'm afraid one does start using these words like fascist and
[1:46:53.520 --> 1:46:58.560]  Hitlerian when one looks at what is happening and there's no doubt that the
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:05.800]  political class in Europe as in America is now grabbing for absolute power it's
[1:47:05.800 --> 1:47:10.720]  trying to end democracy it's trying to preserve all the trappings and all the
[1:47:10.720 --> 1:47:15.040]  appearance of democracy you could still go to the polls every four years but it
[1:47:15.040 --> 1:47:19.440]  won't make any difference because the decisions will all be taken by people you
[1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:24.080]  don't elect you can't hold to account you can't question them you can't remove
[1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:28.000]  them and you can't replace them we've been living under that system now for
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:32.960]  20 or 30 years with the Hitler's of the European Union of course they don't wear
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:37.320]  jackboots of course they don't go around gassing people anymore it's not that
[1:47:37.320 --> 1:47:42.720]  kind of thing what it is though is it could very easily lead to that because
[1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:47.920]  if you don't keep democracy as a constant injection of restraint and common
[1:47:47.920 --> 1:47:54.360]  sense into the governing system then that's the way things go towards ever
[1:47:54.360 --> 1:47:58.800]  greater extremism you only have to look at this whole climate rubbish now
[1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:03.880]  anybody with half a brain can see that that's been oversold prodigiously and
[1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:09.640]  yet the entire governing class worldwide went for it why not because they
[1:48:09.640 --> 1:48:13.680]  cared about whether it was true or not all they cared about was was it
[1:48:13.680 --> 1:48:17.880]  convenient was it expedient was it profitable was it going to give them
[1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:22.640]  this power that they want in ever larger it was another power wrap so that's my
[1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:26.560]  question that's my question before we get back into the whole latest on
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:31.840]  climate what is going to happen then in England if you have John Major coming
[1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:35.800]  out and saying we deserve to be able to vote and we need to get out of the
[1:48:35.800 --> 1:48:39.800]  euro or at least weaken it and then you've got all these people prancing
[1:48:39.800 --> 1:48:45.440]  around in the fake Labour parties and the fake Tory parties as you said giving
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:51.520]  you two choices of the same thing that's their your modern tyrannical way what
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:55.040]  is going to happen is they're purely revealed I mean most the European
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:58.040]  countries were brought in without a vote now they're being told you'll have no
[1:48:58.040 --> 1:49:01.880]  authority over taxes I mean this is incredible I mean all you've got to do
[1:49:01.880 --> 1:49:07.120]  is call them out and you think they would just fall but they don't well they
[1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:12.200]  don't because our political class will not let us have a say on this you see
[1:49:12.200 --> 1:49:15.920]  when the political class gets on when the government gets something wrong and
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:20.520]  it got Europe very badly wrong at a very early stage and when it becomes
[1:49:20.520 --> 1:49:24.440]  blindingly obvious to everyone that the government got it wrong and the entire
[1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:29.480]  governing class got it wrong then it simply can't and won't admit its
[1:49:29.480 --> 1:49:33.560]  mistake why because although ministers come and go the civil servants in the
[1:49:33.560 --> 1:49:38.400]  background who are in favour of all this because if they want more pay and greater
[1:49:38.400 --> 1:49:42.200]  power they can just go to Europe and get a European civil service job they are
[1:49:42.200 --> 1:49:46.400]  all still in place they are all untouched by whatever the people may think
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:50.560]  and they don't want this change they don't want to admit their mistake any
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:53.320]  more than they do on the climate thing I only bring in the climate thing here as
[1:49:53.320 --> 1:49:58.880]  an illustration of how no longer does our governing class care whether it's
[1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:03.160]  getting things right or wrong it doesn't even try to get them right it simply
[1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:08.000]  governs purely for the sake of dismantling democracy that's what's
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:14.560]  going on now piece by piece step by step they're taking democracy away they're
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:19.280]  doing it largely by stealth we still have elections they don't mean anything

[1:54:11.200 --> 1:54:15.480]  you know many historians have pointed out that each generation faces a new form of
[1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:19.600]  tyranny and it always looks different and is packaged different and smells
[1:54:19.600 --> 1:54:25.560]  different to a certain extent than the last one and because people don't know
[1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:29.320]  history they're doomed to repeat it whereas Lord Acton said power corrupts
[1:54:29.320 --> 1:54:33.800]  or power tends to corrupt absolute power corrupts absolutely and there is no
[1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:38.400]  doubt with all of their taxes the regulations banning kids having balloons
[1:54:38.400 --> 1:54:43.080]  outdoor space heaters businesses everything the euro does is pure
[1:54:43.080 --> 1:54:47.400]  tyranny and now it's transferring publicly to an undemocratic thing and
[1:54:47.400 --> 1:54:55.600]  our own media is praising it I mean it's it's twilight zone ish to see this as
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:03.000]  they just normalize it and now there's cracks in the facade you have David
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:06.560]  Cameron I mean here's the headline UK should stay in the EU says Cameron he
[1:55:06.560 --> 1:55:10.480]  goes on to say he will not support we'll try to block a referendum on UK
[1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:14.200]  membership of the European Union imagine you go under something that makes your
[1:55:14.200 --> 1:55:19.720]  laws and it's a bureaucracy that has a baiting a debating committee but you're
[1:55:19.720 --> 1:55:24.840]  you're it's like our Super Congress now with spending bills they bring forward
[1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:28.440]  the bill not an individual member it's not debated it's brought forward for an
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:31.800]  up or down vote and if you don't pass it then it just goes ahead in the Super
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:36.080]  Congress passes it it's like you can rubber stamp this if you want but if you
[1:55:36.080 --> 1:55:39.000]  don't we're going ahead with it I mean this is like a Monty Python skit or
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:43.960]  something about a false democracy or false Republic and democracies are
[1:55:43.960 --> 1:55:46.880]  dangerous because people can vote for something bad but you can have a
[1:55:46.880 --> 1:55:51.520]  Republic that has democracy in it but blocks excesses this is the worst form
[1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:56.800]  where it's just pure tyranny so just to get this great then what is the
[1:55:56.800 --> 1:56:01.760]  magnitude of this because the former British Prime Minister former Tory John
[1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:09.560]  Major says this will end UK sovereignty it will transfer the financial system of
[1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:15.840]  London to Frankfurt what is the what is the full import of this what does this
[1:56:15.840 --> 1:56:22.440]  say about the power structure in in the UK that that this is happening the
[1:56:22.440 --> 1:56:27.360]  first thing to say is that Frankfurt already controls the city of London
[1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:34.600]  from the 1st of January last year 2010 all control over the regulation city of
[1:56:34.600 --> 1:56:39.280]  London passed to the European Union it did so more or less secretly there's
[1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:43.240]  still quite a lot of people in the city who themselves don't realize who their
[1:56:43.240 --> 1:56:49.320]  new masters now are but the city of London is already history people are
[1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:54.680]  moving out large financial institutions are realizing that they don't want to be
[1:56:54.680 --> 1:56:58.360]  in a city of London that's part of the European Union they want to be
[1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:03.800]  outside it they're moving to Geneva and here's the thing so many of them are
[1:57:03.800 --> 1:57:08.320]  now trying to move to Switzerland which is in Europe but outside the European
[1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:12.080]  Union has all the trading rights and freedoms but none of the obligations
[1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:16.200]  and none of the political nonsense it remains a democracy they now have so
[1:57:16.200 --> 1:57:22.000]  many people from the city of London major firms trying to get out of Britain
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:27.520]  and get out of Europe this new sinister dictatorship and get into
[1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:33.520]  Switzerland instead that the Swiss can't on where the financial center in
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:39.280]  Switzerland is has had to close its waiting list for applications from
[1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:45.080]  Britain to move in and set up business there that's how fast people are now
[1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:49.840]  already realizing that the city of London is finished this great
[1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:55.680]  institution which has been there trading successfully and freely for more than
[1:57:55.680 --> 1:58:02.680]  600 years has just gone through two of the worst decades for stock market
[1:58:02.680 --> 1:58:07.240]  performance since records first began more than 600 years ago what Hitler was
[1:58:07.240 --> 1:58:12.920]  unable to do the euro has now done that's right they have taken power away
[1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:16.280]  from the city of London and I remember I went and had breakfast with the law
[1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:21.840]  man's about 20 years ago now and he was urging me to write a leading article in

[2:00:12.400 --> 2:00:19.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:23.440]  Alex Jones
[2:00:23.440 --> 2:00:32.320]  you see tyrants of the 21st century have learned to come by stealth and
[2:00:32.320 --> 2:00:36.560]  through bureaucracies and regional governorships that destroy your local
[2:00:36.560 --> 2:00:39.640]  autonomy Lord Monk did sorry they were interrupted by the break you were
[2:00:39.640 --> 2:00:44.560]  getting into 20 years ago yes I had breakfast with the Lord Mayor in the
[2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:50.040]  mansion house very nice breakfast it was to just the two of us and he was trying
[2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:55.720]  to urge me to write a leading article in the evening standard to advocate that
[2:00:55.720 --> 2:01:00.720]  the European Central Bank should be established in the United Kingdom and
[2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:04.320]  I said look of course we're not going to put the Central Bank in the city of
[2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:08.240]  London because Britain won't be joining the euro he said what you mean it won't
[2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:12.320]  be joining the euro won't be joining the European currency I said no it won't the
[2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:17.440]  people won't stand for that we want to keep our currency weak though it is it's
[2:01:17.440 --> 2:01:20.960]  going to be better than what will happen to this pure political creation and
[2:01:20.960 --> 2:01:25.720]  there's no way that I'm going to argue that anything from the European Union
[2:01:25.720 --> 2:01:30.960]  should be sent into the city of London my advice to you is steer well clear but
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:36.920]  he was rather baffled by this because of course the consensus among all the the
[2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:41.280]  great and the good was that Europe was wonderful and could do no wrong now the
[2:01:41.280 --> 2:01:45.200]  city of London is one of the major recruiting grounds for UKIP we are
[2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:50.400]  raising a lot of money there people have suddenly begun to wake up to just how
[2:01:50.400 --> 2:01:55.360]  dangerous this European project is and in a way there's enormous sadness because
[2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:59.840]  of course the city of London is the great international arm of the United
[2:01:59.840 --> 2:02:03.800]  Kingdom we are not an island in the sense of the free market we trade all
[2:02:03.800 --> 2:02:08.520]  over the world the city of London is the center of that trade and we've always
[2:02:08.520 --> 2:02:13.800]  been outward looking internationalist European minded and I was reading in the
[2:02:13.800 --> 2:02:19.000]  last few years you've lost the number one status oh by a long since yes and
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:23.520]  and we're losing it very very quickly now that the decline is precipitate as
[2:02:23.520 --> 2:02:28.200]  people are desperate to get out from under the so the EU bureaucrats and the
[2:02:28.200 --> 2:02:32.040]  traders in your country have done a wonderful devastating job and they
[2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:36.120]  brought in tons of foreigners who aren't from the UK so they don't care if you
[2:02:36.120 --> 2:02:41.000]  lose your sovereignty so it's a wonderful plan well it it's it's a great
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:47.200]  tragedy that this independent financial center which ran itself no longer has
[2:02:47.200 --> 2:02:51.760]  the right to run itself it has now been made subject to the European tyranny
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:56.600]  which is very rapidly tightening its grip and closing it down after all the
[2:02:56.600 --> 2:03:01.040]  European Union didn't want to have to compete with the city of London if you
[2:03:01.040 --> 2:03:05.960]  add all the other currencies of Europe together including the euro it's tiny
[2:03:05.960 --> 2:03:10.960]  compared with the sterling area and the vast amount of sterling currency in
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:16.400]  issue and so they have always wanted to shut the city of London down to remove a
[2:03:16.400 --> 2:03:22.600]  source of competition to remove also a symbol of freedom because this was what
[2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:27.040]  Hitler always was trying to do it was to take away all symbols of freedom so
[2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:31.160]  that people gradually forgot what freedom is no longer realize they could
[2:03:31.160 --> 2:03:35.520]  have freedom and how wonderful it is and became comfortable with dictatorship
[2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:39.120]  that's what's being attempted here that's why the likes of David Cameron are
[2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:43.040]  saying no we're not going to give the British people say on the future of
[2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:46.920]  Britain on the on the central question of whether Britain is there a way to
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:52.800]  recall him because that that is such a naked arrogant anti sovereign anti
[2:03:52.800 --> 2:03:59.880]  choice issue regardless of what we've got is is the three major political parties
[2:03:59.880 --> 2:04:04.460]  the Conservatives the Labour and to a much lesser extent the so-called liberal
[2:04:04.460 --> 2:04:09.920]  Democrats who are neither liberal nor democratic these people all of them think
[2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:13.480]  the European Union is wonderful dictatorship is marvelous tyranny is
[2:04:13.480 --> 2:04:18.040]  where we want to go and so whoever you vote for unless you do vote for you keep
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:22.400]  you're not going to be voting for freedom now the thing is what you keep
[2:04:22.400 --> 2:04:27.320]  difficult of course is that it is still seen quite wrongly as a one-issue party
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:31.280]  that only is concerned with freedom well of course even if that were the
[2:04:31.280 --> 2:04:34.480]  board Moncton hold on I'm sorry most the brakes are at the end of the hour in the
[2:04:34.480 --> 2:04:37.720]  start of the hour if you can if you've got to go go ahead and leave us now but
[2:04:37.720 --> 2:04:40.400]  I want to give out some websites and things and have one more question for

[2:04:43.080 --> 2:04:46.400]  the other side yes okay great we're gonna go to break come back with Lord
[2:04:46.400 --> 2:04:49.760]  Moncton then I promise I've covered a lot of news but I'm gonna get to the rest

[2:08:32.720 --> 2:08:37.200]  all right finishing up and Lord Christopher Monkton this is a very
[2:08:37.200 --> 2:08:41.800]  positive thing I see happening to have the former British Prime Minister who
[2:08:41.800 --> 2:08:50.360]  signed England the UK into the European Union which is completely tyrannical now
[2:08:50.360 --> 2:08:54.400]  most the countries were brought in without a vote just like England and
[2:08:54.400 --> 2:09:00.680]  now I've seen polls of 85 or more percent some as high as 90 wanting out of it
[2:09:00.680 --> 2:09:07.040]  and all its taxes and regulations and the rest of it they have members from the
[2:09:07.040 --> 2:09:12.440]  UK in the Parliament but it has no authority as members of UKIP have come
[2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:19.240]  on like Nigel Farage and others so it is just absolutely stunning that it has
[2:09:19.240 --> 2:09:24.800]  come to this point and our government's been signing deals with the EU to start
[2:09:24.800 --> 2:09:29.600]  doing trade deals this is how they get rid of your sovereignty so so in closing
[2:09:29.600 --> 2:09:33.400]  Lord Monkton it's always darkest till the dawn or you don't know what you have
[2:09:33.400 --> 2:09:36.880]  till it's gone I mean it always takes tyranny getting bad before people wake
[2:09:36.880 --> 2:09:43.520]  up is England starting to have its Neville Chamberlain moment or will that
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:47.720]  come later because if there's now open discussions of just getting out of it
[2:09:47.720 --> 2:09:52.800]  entirely and in calling an undemocratic by people like John Major this has got
[2:09:52.800 --> 2:09:57.600]  to show there's a big wake-up call happening that's absolutely right it's
[2:09:57.600 --> 2:10:00.760]  very interesting how the media are beginning to break on this the BBC of
[2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:08.240]  course is part of the Marxist sort of fascist conspiracy they will not ever
[2:10:08.240 --> 2:10:12.120]  represent the British people's view on this issue they won't tell you what's
[2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:15.960]  really going on in Europe to them it's you know it's socialism writ large and
[2:10:15.960 --> 2:10:21.660]  they love it but the daily telegraph the times even and to some extent the
[2:10:21.660 --> 2:10:27.040]  financial times certainly the Daily Mail and Daily Express which are the big
[2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:31.920]  kind of medium quality but big circulation papers they are now very very
[2:10:31.920 --> 2:10:37.680]  strongly against having anything further to do with the European Union and so
[2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:44.520]  gradually the papers and the people are lining up and they're saying no we want
[2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:48.400]  our freedom back we want our democracy back we don't want the European
[2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:53.840]  currency we don't want European tyranny we want to elect the people who make our
[2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:58.840]  laws and we don't want any laws imposed on us unless the people we elect have
[2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:03.600]  said that those laws should be inflicted upon us and that is the big change
[2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:08.520]  which we are now increasingly demanding UKIP is now being listened to with
[2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:13.680]  widespread respect on this issue because we have been saying for years that
[2:11:13.680 --> 2:11:18.400]  this day would come that people would once again want their freedom back and
[2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:22.760]  your voice Alex is a very important one in this people will say oh but he's
[2:11:22.760 --> 2:11:27.600]  terribly extreme but on the other hand on issues like this you are in the
[2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:33.040]  mainstream of public opinion the mainstream of public opinion says enough
[2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:37.640]  is enough democracy is what we want and we're going to have it and it's just a
[2:11:37.640 --> 2:11:42.480]  matter of time now well the entire present political class certainly in the
[2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:48.000]  UK and I think in the United States too it's swept away and replaced by people
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:54.720]  who remember what your Constitution was for it was so that no law could be made
[2:11:54.720 --> 2:12:00.200]  except by people that you elected to make it that's what we're going to have
[2:12:00.200 --> 2:12:04.560]  to get back to and from my point of view and I think from yours Alex the sooner
[2:12:04.560 --> 2:12:08.720]  the better absolutely here's my final question for you well it's a two-parter
[2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:14.040]  where do you see this fight going in the future the way that you know the ships
[2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:17.960]  are basically you know beginning to get into battle formation and and you know now
[2:12:17.960 --> 2:12:21.720]  there's actually opposition really starting to to form for every action
[2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:29.040]  there's an equal and opposite reaction a and b you were bringing up the fact that
[2:12:29.040 --> 2:12:32.880]  you know that I'm in the mainstream on this issue I mean I really find common
[2:12:32.880 --> 2:12:38.400]  sense is always in the mainstream it's just ignored until the damage from not
[2:12:38.400 --> 2:12:42.240]  following common sense becomes so great but they've always said we're the
[2:12:42.240 --> 2:12:46.160]  minority and we're crazy not believing their man-made global warming when the
[2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:50.600]  facts have been out forever so I just think it's stick to it tell the truth
[2:12:50.600 --> 2:12:56.200]  and in and if you stand up against the lie and don't stop you you will always
[2:12:56.200 --> 2:13:01.720]  end up beating it I think two things are going to happen now first of all that
[2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:07.320]  gradually in Britain UKIP is going to become seen widely as respectable
[2:13:07.320 --> 2:13:11.160]  that's already very largely happened it's going to happen much more rapidly from
[2:13:11.160 --> 2:13:15.960]  here on and it's it's that air of respectability of no longer being an
[2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:20.560]  unconsidered whining fringe that will make the difference I think in Britain
[2:13:20.560 --> 2:13:24.480]  and start leading to us beginning to capture parliamentary seats that's
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:28.840]  thing number one but thing number two I think what is going to happen is that
[2:13:28.840 --> 2:13:34.400]  people are gradually going to try and insulate themselves from their governing
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:39.040]  class they're going to start running their own independent privately run
[2:13:39.040 --> 2:13:44.360]  currencies I'm already working on this at the moment and the idea here is that
[2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:48.160]  we issue a currency which is not printed or minted so you can't fall foul of the
[2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:52.840]  law there it's purely electronic but it can't inflate because it will be fully
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:13:55.760]  backed by assets I'm not going to bore you with the technicalities but what I'm
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:13:59.840]  really saying is that what is gradually happening here is that people are saying
[2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:05.080]  we can no longer trust the government to do things for us like making foreign
[2:14:05.080 --> 2:14:09.640]  treaties or issuing currencies so we are going to start doing this for ourselves
[2:14:09.640 --> 2:14:14.960]  and increasingly cut the government out of our planning and our thinking and our
[2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:19.920]  hopes because the governing class is clearly no longer in touch with the
[2:14:19.920 --> 2:14:24.120]  people it is nominally in charge of that's the interesting thing about John
[2:14:24.120 --> 2:14:29.360]  Major's defection to the truth he was the arch architect of Britain's
[2:14:29.360 --> 2:14:34.360]  membership of the European Union before they was just the European why is he
[2:14:34.360 --> 2:14:37.400]  doing this I mean is it that the power structure in England realizes they've
[2:14:37.400 --> 2:14:41.480]  been double-crossed or is it because he wants to get his soul back or because
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:45.240]  he's getting so much pressure or a combination I think it's probably because
[2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:49.000]  was no longer being in office he's no longer being constantly bullied by civil
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:52.860]  servants who think Europe is wonderful in the way that David Cameron is civil
[2:14:52.860 --> 2:14:57.760]  service is very very smooth and very very powerful in Britain and it's also
[2:14:57.760 --> 2:15:02.440]  now I think the biggest obstacle to progress towards freedom that Britain
[2:15:02.440 --> 2:15:07.080]  has and David Cameron is enmeshed in that he is a bureaucrat bureaucrat in
[2:15:07.080 --> 2:15:10.480]  just the same way that John Major was when he was in office the difference is
[2:15:10.480 --> 2:15:14.920]  that now that John Major is out of office and has been out of it long enough he
[2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:19.760]  is no longer constantly being whispered at by these people who want to enhance
[2:15:19.760 --> 2:15:23.000]  the power of the corporatist dictatorship at the expense of the people
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:28.920]  and so he's begun to rediscover the joys of freedom it is I mean you're quite
[2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:35.200]  right this bellwether that's what he is is leading the way towards other members
[2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:40.520]  of the governing class Lord Heskis is just one among them who are leaving
[2:15:40.520 --> 2:15:46.000]  the sinking ship of corporatist fascist socialist communists call it what you
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:51.160]  like but it's tyranny whichever way you stack it they now realize this doesn't
[2:15:51.160 --> 2:15:55.360]  work it's not going to give them the power and the wealth that they crave it's
[2:15:55.360 --> 2:15:59.640]  going to turn Britain into a banana monarchy without any bananas and soon
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:03.040]  without a monarchy well that was my final point is that that's what
[2:16:03.040 --> 2:16:07.200]  tyranny always does it works at first like a cancer running through the body
[2:16:07.200 --> 2:16:14.200]  but then it kills the host and I mean they've got to know I mean Europe is
[2:16:14.200 --> 2:16:18.640]  delusional the same thing Hitler did many others Napoleon they start taking
[2:16:18.640 --> 2:16:23.000]  their invincible so they set up a system as I've seen some European engineers
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:27.720]  admit 30 years ago was meant to bring countries into receivership but the
[2:16:27.720 --> 2:16:32.240]  imploding of those countries their over taxation regulation then implodes the
[2:16:32.240 --> 2:16:38.120]  overall structure that even the bureaucrats and the insiders sit upon
[2:16:38.120 --> 2:16:44.280]  and so they're going good at it because it could go one of two ways and it
[2:16:44.280 --> 2:16:48.800]  would be very difficult to predict which way it's going to go one thing that
[2:16:48.800 --> 2:16:53.400]  could happen is that Britain gets out of Europe other countries realize they
[2:16:53.400 --> 2:16:57.440]  don't want to be in it either and the whole thing collapses into a narrow
[2:16:57.440 --> 2:17:01.080]  putrid inward looking and England could lead the way I mean if England leaves
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:05.520]  that's it everybody else is going to exactly and we can hope for that but the
[2:17:05.520 --> 2:17:10.880]  other danger is that those who had waited for and planned for the financial
[2:17:10.880 --> 2:17:16.240]  collapse of the euro zone so that they could then say the only way out is
[2:17:16.240 --> 2:17:21.400]  dictatorship they are still in the Ascendant David Cameron belongs to that
[2:17:21.400 --> 2:17:25.280]  group Nick Clegg belongs no that's what I'm saying they think the crisis will
[2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:29.120]  lead them to total power but I see it destroying them in the end because they've
[2:17:29.120 --> 2:17:31.880]  been so good at wrecking things just it's like the greenies
[2:17:31.880 --> 2:17:38.040]  the danger is the danger is that they will get away with imposing this
[2:17:38.040 --> 2:17:43.920]  dictatorship before it collapses and of course it will still eventually collapse
[2:17:43.920 --> 2:17:48.320]  and the more nasty and intrusive the dictatorship becomes the more
[2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:52.240]  unpopular it will become the more unsustainable it will become and that
[2:17:52.240 --> 2:17:56.080]  is something which these arrogant little so-and-sos in government tend to
[2:17:56.080 --> 2:17:59.720]  forget one of the most refreshing things about being part of Margaret
[2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:03.760]  Thatcher's administration I was a very junior cog in it but I was in there right
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:08.600]  at her side if you like in 10 Downing Street was that that was a government
[2:18:08.600 --> 2:18:13.640]  that was always very conscious that it was only there for a time it was there
[2:18:13.640 --> 2:18:18.640]  to do good by the people and it was there to bring back freedom and put back
[2:18:18.640 --> 2:18:22.880]  wealth into people's pockets and take it away from the state that was what we
[2:18:22.880 --> 2:18:27.280]  were all about and no government in Britain since has really tried to do
[2:18:27.280 --> 2:18:31.200]  that but once again we're going to have to get back and she said she was an
[2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:37.200]  enemy of the Bilderberg group well she was an enemy of all these instinctual
[2:18:37.200 --> 2:18:42.520]  fascists these people who think that the great and the good are wiser than the
[2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:47.080]  rest of us and they should be allowed to govern in our name whether with or
[2:18:47.080 --> 2:18:53.200]  without our consent those days I hope are now done and I hope that in Britain
[2:18:53.200 --> 2:18:58.720]  and in Europe we will get our democracy back because if we don't America will
[2:18:58.720 --> 2:19:01.760]  be next all right Lord Mock them we're out of time I appreciate the time
[2:19:01.760 --> 2:19:06.400]  science of public policy dot org I just wanted to point out here in closing to
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:10.760]  you that you said the danger is total dictatorship all the greenies I see are
[2:19:10.760 --> 2:19:15.440]  in the news like it's normal saying green dictatorship do it whether people
[2:19:15.440 --> 2:19:19.280]  like it or not and I hear locals in Austin saying we're gonna do this one
[2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:22.480]  way or the other has nothing to do with the environment it's there the new
[2:19:22.480 --> 2:19:27.720]  color of fascism is green Lord Moncton thank you so much for joining us thank

[2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:57.160]  exciting with KRS one because he's an icon let's go ahead and get some more
[2:39:57.160 --> 2:40:01.640]  details from Zach Carter on this that good to have you here with us thank you
[2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:05.880]  so much for having me Alex so it's a pleasure that's great to have you here
[2:40:05.880 --> 2:40:09.920]  so tell us about yourselves people know who you are and then tell us about what
[2:40:09.920 --> 2:40:15.080]  you're organizing here yeah a little background on me I spent three years at
[2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:19.280]  the duty army and foreign the reserves so I was in the reserves when I made that
[2:40:19.280 --> 2:40:24.440]  video back in late 2007 that got me booted from the reserves I was my
[2:40:24.440 --> 2:40:29.520]  contribution back then and I wanted to do more but I was under you know a lot
[2:40:29.520 --> 2:40:35.360]  of pressure to keep quiet from my family they didn't you know want me going to
[2:40:35.360 --> 2:40:40.040]  Leavenworth and I've been told you know if you you don't do anything else you
[2:40:40.040 --> 2:40:45.560]  know this will go away kind of quietly and I kind of regret not speaking out
[2:40:45.560 --> 2:40:51.240]  more than but you know fast forward a few years and I've worked on a few
[2:40:51.240 --> 2:40:55.640]  congressional campaigns in between a Senate campaign made a lot of contacts
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:41:01.640]  and been able to put together you know this amazing team of people everybody
[2:41:01.640 --> 2:41:07.040]  from you know in the entertainment world at record labels and and band managers
[2:41:07.040 --> 2:41:12.920]  and artists themselves and I have this idea about a about a month and a half
[2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:18.200]  ago and I've been working about 16 hours a day seven days a week since then you
[2:41:18.200 --> 2:41:21.000]  were telling me you're going after rock and roll you name it but I found it
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:25.640]  interesting it's the hip-hop folks that have been the most responsive yeah but
[2:41:25.640 --> 2:41:31.720]  we do have an extremely diverse lineup and and it and it keeps growing I had
[2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:35.960]  Avery Sharp you know a famous jazz musician get ahold of me this weekend
[2:41:35.960 --> 2:41:40.280]  letting me know he's interested and wants more information and wants to
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:43.480]  support Ron Paul that well I know you can probably get Jimmy Vaughn involved I
[2:41:43.480 --> 2:41:49.080]  know he travels all over playing for Ron Paul supporting him yeah yeah and it's
[2:41:49.080 --> 2:41:53.320]  something unique about this also is you know we're keeping all the shows free
[2:41:53.320 --> 2:41:58.680]  to the public and you know what when I approach politics I bring my past
[2:41:58.680 --> 2:42:04.400]  experiences with me and and I'm really not a fan of the big money but before I
[2:42:04.400 --> 2:42:07.880]  joined the army I did something that was really frivolous but it got me a lot of
[2:42:07.880 --> 2:42:12.600]  media attention and so you know I bring that with me that you know if you do
[2:42:12.600 --> 2:42:16.400]  something a little different you can get talked about in the media no sure
[2:42:16.400 --> 2:42:20.560]  Willie Nelson's done a lot of free media you know free events to get attention
[2:42:20.560 --> 2:42:24.400]  to farm aid and and so it's a gift and then the venues can sell drinks and
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:27.440]  things you call them they're Ron Paul supporters sure they give you the venue
[2:42:27.440 --> 2:42:32.160]  for free they pay their staff off the sales of food and drinks that the artists
[2:42:32.160 --> 2:42:35.400]  come they get a little bit of publicity but they're there giving and and that's
[2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:39.000]  what makes these things big is the fact that they're free so wow I didn't know
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:42.800]  that this is gonna be free on top of it that is really gonna supercharge this
[2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:48.440]  yeah and you know we've been able to get in smaller venues on this first leg
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:53.080]  but we're hoping we can you know save money through sponsorships and all that
[2:42:53.080 --> 2:42:58.080]  and we're planning a second leg after Christmas and there's all sorts of
[2:42:58.080 --> 2:43:01.480]  venues I've talked to before as Willie Nelson was like hey let's do an event and
[2:43:01.480 --> 2:43:05.040]  I was like are you really serious Willie it was his idea and he said yeah it's a
[2:43:05.040 --> 2:43:08.400]  caller called in and said it and I talked to him and then I went and got you
[2:43:08.400 --> 2:43:11.400]  know a big place in Austin was ready to do it just for the concessions and then
[2:43:11.400 --> 2:43:15.240]  his manager's got involved like look well let's just not do it and he's like
[2:43:15.240 --> 2:43:20.120]  no come to my closing in the backyard come to that and speaks we get there
[2:43:20.120 --> 2:43:23.640]  people are calling up death-threading we don't even care about speaking to 5,000
[2:43:23.640 --> 2:43:27.440]  people you know it just turns into a whole quagmire dealing with these people's
[2:43:27.440 --> 2:43:31.880]  managers but you know it's the thought that counts at the end of the day but
[2:43:31.880 --> 2:43:35.200]  and obviously hopefully you'll be able to get Ron Paul to speak at a couple of
[2:43:35.200 --> 2:43:40.640]  these well very exciting people need to go to the website if they want to learn
[2:43:40.640 --> 2:43:46.320]  more on this it's rocktherevolutiontour.com tell us about some of the
[2:43:46.320 --> 2:43:50.240]  places that are already booked and set up and some of the dates involved yeah
[2:43:50.240 --> 2:43:55.600]  well in Austin Texas will be there on November 10th and that'll be at I think
[2:43:55.600 --> 2:44:03.400]  called the Karma Club and definitely you you are invited Mr. Jones and thank you
[2:44:03.400 --> 2:44:07.960]  Zach we're not only on in Austin though so what are some of the other places yeah
[2:44:07.960 --> 2:44:12.640]  yeah you're invited to as many of the shows as you want to go to so I'm not
[2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:16.000]  talking about me I'm saying where are some of the other events yeah yeah we're
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:20.600]  kicking off in Spanaway Washington was just outside of the Seattle Tacoma area
[2:44:20.600 --> 2:44:27.080]  and then we're going to Portland and Eureka California down to San Francisco
[2:44:27.080 --> 2:44:36.040]  Santa Monica we've got a few venues in LA and then to Vegas Albuquerque and from
[2:44:36.040 --> 2:44:44.840]  the yeah Phoenix Albuquerque Vegas I'm not able to pull the website up right
[2:44:44.840 --> 2:44:48.320]  now well that's all right people should visit the website it's a it's a very
[2:44:48.320 --> 2:44:53.120]  very exciting idea and hopefully we'll also work on getting some of the artists
[2:44:53.120 --> 2:44:56.960]  back on it's been a while we get K.R.S.1 back on and some of these other people
[2:44:56.960 --> 2:45:01.720]  and yeah both to have you know the voice of independence he's got some great
[2:45:01.720 --> 2:45:05.560]  music and the rise concise and crooked I know they've got some stuff where they
[2:45:05.560 --> 2:45:10.600]  drop your name J.D. Nero and and others great Liberty artists that maybe you
[2:45:10.600 --> 2:45:16.080]  should contact somebody like Jimmy Vaughn yeah definitely we're definitely
[2:45:16.080 --> 2:45:20.640]  reaching out to everybody you know that you might be interested in supporting
[2:45:20.640 --> 2:45:26.520]  Ron Paul this way and it's gonna be a lot of fun and you know hopefully you
[2:45:26.520 --> 2:45:30.280]  know we'll be able to kind of break through that some of that you know that
[2:45:30.280 --> 2:45:35.520]  media blackout that Ron Paul has been experiencing and well look Ron Paul is a
[2:45:35.520 --> 2:45:39.000]  top-tier candidate he could still win look at how the media finally said
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:42.880]  Kane could win so he's gone to the number one position people are looking
[2:45:42.880 --> 2:45:47.380]  for something real I saw him in the news saying Christie's obese so they want to
[2:45:47.380 --> 2:45:50.640]  vote for him because they think if you're obese that means you're different
[2:45:50.640 --> 2:45:54.440]  people need to stop going off of how somebody looks and go to the character
[2:45:54.440 --> 2:46:00.520]  their deeds their history Ron Paul's no compromise Constitution loving voting
[2:46:00.520 --> 2:46:04.400]  record this is the guy who predicted what would happen this is the perfect
[2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:09.280]  man of the hour and if America lets this wicked corporate media cover him up
[2:46:09.280 --> 2:46:12.960]  and do this we get what we deserve but by him running he's still injects real
[2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:17.360]  issues he's still got a good chance the primaries don't kick in for three months
[2:46:17.360 --> 2:46:23.280]  or so we've got the time to supercharge it and what you're doing is so beautiful
[2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:28.560]  and people need to be part of this all over the country there's also Prodigy
[2:46:28.560 --> 2:46:33.200]  mob mob deep who I know is a big listener of this shows you might not
[2:46:33.200 --> 2:46:37.040]  want to contact him but there's so many people that are Ron Paul supporters I
[2:46:37.040 --> 2:46:40.240]  think I've even seen Neil Young say nice things about him you know you want to
[2:46:40.240 --> 2:46:43.920]  get somebody like Neil Young now obviously I'm not going to call these
[2:46:43.920 --> 2:46:48.400]  people for you I mean I do have their numbers but I would try to get a hold of
[2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:52.560]  Willie Nelson that's somebody who can get up tens of thousands out I try to get
[2:46:52.560 --> 2:46:57.360]  a hold of a Neil Young I would Jimmy Vaughn gets thousands and tens of
[2:46:57.360 --> 2:47:05.000]  thousands out I go after him I know I know some other folks but I'm very
[2:47:05.000 --> 2:47:10.200]  exciting very very exciting and Zach will definitely talk to you soon as this
[2:47:10.200 --> 2:47:14.720]  unfolds God bless God bless you sir thank you so much thank you for coming on

[2:47:23.560 --> 2:47:31.560]  sacrifice of KRS-1 and others we really appreciate them doing that okay
[2:47:31.560 --> 2:47:38.880]  continuing here with the news and information I do want to play a little
[2:47:38.880 --> 2:47:42.040]  bit more of that Hank Williams Jr. song where he's countering the
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:47.400]  establishment but I want to get to this article first again it's this article is
[2:47:47.400 --> 2:47:53.440]  up at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com it is incredibly important I should
[2:47:53.440 --> 2:47:59.320]  have led the show with us today. Verisign demands power to kill abusive
[2:47:59.320 --> 2:48:04.920]  websites I'm gonna cover this more than that on the news tonight this is how
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:09.040]  they're gonna do it where there's no judge no jury no nothing an agency says
[2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:12.920]  they want it gone or a corporation says it and your website is gone and they're
[2:48:12.920 --> 2:48:17.800]  shutting down websites already like this it's all part of the cashless system
[2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:21.040]  where suddenly you have all these bank fees on you but you've got to operate
[2:48:21.040 --> 2:48:25.760]  cashlessly it's all about the globalist getting you where they want you
[2:48:25.760 --> 2:48:33.200]  verisign demands power to kill abusive websites manager of all.com internet
[2:48:33.200 --> 2:48:38.680]  addresses seeks authority to terminate domains on government order without
[2:48:38.680 --> 2:48:44.600]  legal oversight now again dredge linked to like four of our articles last week
[2:48:44.600 --> 2:48:48.000]  and I don't shoot the Batman thing up in the sky I did it twice and he's put
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:53.480]  stuff up every time I said please put it up and I don't expect dredge links me
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:48:58.800]  again this week that would be almost almost gratuitous but but the point is
[2:48:58.800 --> 2:49:02.440]  this is big and this is the kind of stuff drugs links to but our listeners
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:06.120]  can make this big as well we need to get this out to everybody okay because this
[2:49:06.120 --> 2:49:12.920]  is really scary the global authority over all.com domain names verisign is
[2:49:12.920 --> 2:49:18.680]  demanding the power to terminate websites deemed abusive I love that all
[2:49:18.680 --> 2:49:22.560]  the time YouTube does that to us when ordered to by government without a
[2:49:22.560 --> 2:49:26.040]  court order any kind of oversight whatsoever yeah we don't need any
[2:49:26.040 --> 2:49:31.920]  stinking court orders we'll do whatever we want the company said today it wants
[2:49:31.920 --> 2:49:36.560]  to be able to enforce the denial cancellation or transfer of any
[2:49:36.560 --> 2:49:41.560]  registration in any of a laundry list of scenarios which a domain is deemed to
[2:49:41.560 --> 2:49:46.760]  be abusive they can already shut it down easy reports the UK register not only
[2:49:46.760 --> 2:49:51.280]  is verisign seeking the power to kill websites when ordered to by governments
